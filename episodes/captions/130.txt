[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 130.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:08] Caesar, when he perceived that the seventh legion which stood close by him was also hard
[00:00:16] pressed by the enemy, directed the tribunes of the soldiers to affect a junction of the legions
[00:00:22] gradually and make their charge upon the enemy with a double front, which having been
[00:00:27] done since they brought assistance to the one to the other, nor feared less, their rear
[00:00:34] should be surrounded by the enemy.
[00:00:37] They began to stand their ground more boldly and to fight more courageously.
[00:00:43] In the meantime, the soldiers of the two legions which had been in the rear of the army as
[00:00:49] a guard for the baggage train upon the battle being reported to them, quickened their
[00:00:55] pace and were seen by the enemy on top of the hill.
[00:00:59] And Titus having gained possession of the camp of the enemy and observed from higher ground
[00:01:05] what was going on in our camp sent the tenth legion as a relief to our men who, when they
[00:01:13] had learned from the flight of the horses and the settlers in what position the affair
[00:01:18] was and in how great danger the camp and the Legion and the commander were involved left
[00:01:25] undone nothing to dispatch.
[00:01:30] By their arrival, so great a change of matters was made that are men, even those who had fallen
[00:01:38] down exhausted with wounds, leaned on their shields and renewed the fight.
[00:01:46] And the camp retainers, though unarmed, seeing the enemy completely dismayed, attacked
[00:01:52] them, though they were armed.
[00:01:56] The horsemen too, that they might, by their valor, blot the disgrace of their flight, thrust
[00:02:03] themselves before the Legionary soldiers in all parts of the battle.
[00:02:10] And the enemy, even in the last hope of safety, displayed such great courage that when
[00:02:18] the foremost of them had fallen, the next stood upon those who were prostrate and fought
[00:02:26] from on top of their bodies.
[00:02:30] When these were overthrown and their corpses heaped up together, those who survived cast
[00:02:37] their weapons against our men as from a mound and returned our darts which had fallen
[00:02:43] short between our armies so that it ought not to be concluded.
[00:02:48] That men of such great courage had indiddishously dared to pass a very broad river,
[00:02:56] a send very high banks and come to a very disinventageous place since their greatness
[00:03:02] of spirit had rendered these actions easy, although in themselves very difficult.
[00:03:19] So war is eternal and some things do not change and in war we see the brutal examples of
[00:03:35] savagery and we also see the courage and sacrifice that's hard to find anywhere else,
[00:03:46] like in that passage right there unarmed men attacking the enemy.
[00:03:51] And even the enemy showing courage, climbing on top of stacked bodies of their brethren
[00:03:58] to gain a little bit of high ground.
[00:04:04] Think about that gaining the high ground by climbing on the backs of your fallen comrades.
[00:04:14] Now that is war and that account of war is from the book The Gallic Wars which was written
[00:04:24] by Julius Caesar himself, although he refers to himself in the third person.
[00:04:31] And that war lasted from around 58 BC to 50 BC, 8 years of fighting between the Gauls
[00:04:40] who were a Celtic race of people in what is now France and Belgium, I guess you'd say
[00:04:49] Celtic.
[00:04:52] And of course the Romans were known for their military strength and in the future I'm
[00:04:59] sure we'll go a little bit deeper into some of Caesar's writing.
[00:05:06] Today we're going to look more at an overall assessment and instruction really about the
[00:05:14] Roman legions which as I said our known as an incredibly powerful military fighting force
[00:05:23] that conquered much of Europe and parts of Africa and the Middle East over time.
[00:05:31] And the writing that we're looking at today comes from a guy by the name of the Gettius.
[00:05:42] Now his full name was Publius, Flavius, Vigettius, Renoptus.
[00:05:52] But thankfully we can just refer to him as the Gettius, not much is known about him.
[00:05:59] It's actually not even known 100% if a Gettius was actually in the military.
[00:06:07] It seems as if he was and even if he was, it's likely that he didn't have any great
[00:06:12] stature or rank inside the Roman military.
[00:06:17] But he did capture some incredibly important information and he called the Epidimal
[00:06:27] Ray Militarus which translates basically into the Epidimal of the Art of War.
[00:06:34] Sometimes it's also called the day Ray Militaria which means on matters of the military.
[00:06:43] And the book is estimated to have been written around 430 AD so it's several hundred years
[00:06:49] after Caesar's reign.
[00:06:52] This book that hero became a guide for warfare throughout the Middle Ages.
[00:07:00] And interestingly this is even it stayed even after we had gunpowder.
[00:07:05] And it was carried often times by general officers and their staff throughout Europe
[00:07:11] and there are even reports that George Washington carried an annotated copy with him
[00:07:18] which as I dug into it may or may not be completely true but Adam Minimum.
[00:07:23] Adam Minimum, he paraphrased Vigettius's book in his first addressed to Congress in 1790
[00:07:33] when he said to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.
[00:07:43] So Vigettius put this information together through Adam Minimum keen observation of how
[00:07:51] the Roman legions and the Roman military worked.
[00:07:57] And the book is to the test of time so I think we might as well see what we can get out
[00:08:02] of it.
[00:08:03] What do you think?
[00:08:05] Yes sir.
[00:08:06] A gree.
[00:08:07] Check.
[00:08:08] It starts off strong.
[00:08:10] We'll say that.
[00:08:12] It starts off right here.
[00:08:16] Victory in war does not depend entirely upon numbers or mere courage, only skill and discipline
[00:08:24] will ensure it.
[00:08:27] It's common theme.
[00:08:31] We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than their
[00:08:36] continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps and unwearied
[00:08:43] cultivation of other arts of war.
[00:08:50] Does this mean I'm just going to be talking about discipline for the next as long as I'm alive?
[00:08:54] Yes.
[00:08:55] It's entirely possible, isn't it?
[00:09:00] It's interesting that he says it's important than just mere, more important than just
[00:09:03] mere courage.
[00:09:04] It encourages important, but there's something more important discipline.
[00:09:08] Yes.
[00:09:09] That's skill.
[00:09:10] And skill.
[00:09:11] You like that part.
[00:09:12] Yes.
[00:09:13] OK.
[00:09:14] Romans.
[00:09:15] OK.
[00:09:16] They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them.
[00:09:19] So we're these talking about what the Romans are talking about the Romans.
[00:09:22] That's the day.
[00:09:23] They thoroughly understood the importance of hardening them by continual practice and of
[00:09:27] training them to every maneuver that might happen in the line and in action.
[00:09:33] How were they less strict in punishing idolness and sloth?
[00:09:42] See sometimes I stick up for like our generation or being modern, saying like, no, you
[00:09:47] know, we're kind of hardcore too.
[00:09:49] But then I read stuff like that and I kind of wonder.
[00:09:53] I kind of wonder.
[00:09:54] The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession.
[00:10:00] He only wants an opportunity to execute what is he is convinced he has been perfectly
[00:10:05] taught.
[00:10:06] So that makes sense.
[00:10:07] I didn't interview a little while ago.
[00:10:10] And as it hasn't come out yet, it was with MPR, NPR, National Public Radio.
[00:10:15] But he was asking me.
[00:10:17] He had heard me saying in an interview that like I wanted to go to war.
[00:10:22] And he was kind of surprised about that.
[00:10:24] But that's exactly what this is talking about.
[00:10:27] I'm trained and you're convinced that you've been taught well and then you want to go
[00:10:31] get after it, especially when you're young.
[00:10:36] You have nothing to lose.
[00:10:40] Back to the book, a handful of men in NERD to war precede to certain victory while on the
[00:10:46] contrary, numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men drag
[00:10:53] to the slaughter.
[00:10:59] No big deal.
[00:11:01] Multitudes of undisciplined men, you're just getting dragged to the slaughter.
[00:11:04] That's life.
[00:11:06] That's life.
[00:11:07] Oh, and here's another point.
[00:11:11] For it is certain that the less a man is acquainted with the sweets of life, the less
[00:11:17] reason he has to be afraid of death.
[00:11:20] Interesting.
[00:11:22] The young soldier, therefore, ought to have a lively eye.
[00:11:26] Oh, this is he's just talking about what the young recruits should be like, what kind
[00:11:32] of qualities they're supposed to have.
[00:11:33] The young soldier, therefore, ought to have a lively eye should carry his head erect,
[00:11:38] his chest and shoulders be broad.
[00:11:40] His shoulders muscular and brawny.
[00:11:42] His fingers long, his arms strong, and his waist, small.
[00:11:47] Going back to posture.
[00:11:49] Remember what that up with Jordan B. Peterson?
[00:11:52] He's got that chaplain as a book stand up straight with your shoulders back.
[00:11:55] I'm like, that's how you get indoctrinated in the military.
[00:11:57] That's been going on since the Roman times.
[00:12:00] There's something to it.
[00:12:01] I'm here to tell you.
[00:12:03] Talking more about the recruits, he says, they should be taught the use of their arms
[00:12:07] by constant and daily exercise.
[00:12:10] But this essential custom has long been abolished by the relaxation introduced by a long
[00:12:15] peace.
[00:12:19] Except that when things get easy.
[00:12:21] And again, working with business all the time, it's real easy when the times are good.
[00:12:29] Like the economies good.
[00:12:30] Right now, the economy is good.
[00:12:32] So people are just making money and everything is good.
[00:12:35] They don't train as hard, they don't prepare as much.
[00:12:38] Happens in everything.
[00:12:39] Yeah, because we kind of subconscious what seems like it anyway.
[00:12:43] Subconsciously rely on that kind of push.
[00:12:45] Like the stress will push you.
[00:12:49] The economy is not good.
[00:12:50] It's like, oh, I kind of pushed you to like, oh, we got to be sure.
[00:12:52] We don't work or whatever.
[00:12:54] And it kind of gives you some people.
[00:12:56] I think you actually do this.
[00:12:58] Some people perform better under pressure.
[00:13:00] The reason I say you, because you'll have a video to make, let's say.
[00:13:06] And if there's no deadline, let's just say there's no real.
[00:13:10] There's no real hope for urgency.
[00:13:12] I'm not expecting to see that.
[00:13:14] But then sometimes there's a deadline like for a master video.
[00:13:18] And there comes the deadline and boom, there's the video.
[00:13:21] Midnight, one o'clock in the morning into my email.
[00:13:26] You need that.
[00:13:27] You need that structure and discipline.
[00:13:29] Younger.
[00:13:30] It does help.
[00:13:31] Yeah.
[00:13:32] 100%.
[00:13:33] Yeah, even time stuff like if you're like, hey, meet me at around seven.
[00:13:39] That's not good.
[00:13:40] Yeah, well, it'll be around whatever time.
[00:13:43] You might as well said, show up when you want.
[00:13:44] I love the dice a little bit today, because I said 1230.
[00:13:47] Yes, did you notice that?
[00:13:48] Yes.
[00:13:49] To me, when you put a number, I just assume that's the number.
[00:13:52] Yeah, that's how.
[00:13:53] That's the style.
[00:13:54] Yeah.
[00:13:55] That's probably good.
[00:13:56] Yeah.
[00:13:57] You're right.
[00:13:58] I think you do pretty good with being on time for me, actually.
[00:14:02] Yeah.
[00:14:03] Yeah.
[00:14:04] Well, I'm going to say you're battening pretty good average.
[00:14:07] Yeah.
[00:14:08] Yeah.
[00:14:09] Did you see someone asked how they could get your job?
[00:14:12] Yes.
[00:14:13] Yeah.
[00:14:14] Yeah.
[00:14:15] Yeah.
[00:14:16] Yeah.
[00:14:17] There you go.
[00:14:18] I guess we know that.
[00:14:19] Yeah, you got to do the price on your head.
[00:14:21] Yeah.
[00:14:22] Someone else maybe they can be on time.
[00:14:24] Yeah.
[00:14:25] That's really that's how they're required.
[00:14:27] Press record the entire.
[00:14:28] There you go.
[00:14:29] You little money.
[00:14:30] All right.
[00:14:31] Now, he's talking a little bit about a initial training going back to the book.
[00:14:35] The first thing the soldiers are to be taught is the military step, which can only
[00:14:40] be acquired by constant practice of marching quick and together.
[00:14:44] Nor is anything of more consequence either on the march or in the line, than they should
[00:14:49] keep their ranks with the greatest exactness for troops who march in irregular and disorderly
[00:14:56] manner are always in great danger of being defeated.
[00:15:00] And I read that part so I could read this part.
[00:15:03] They should march with the common military step 20 miles in five summer hours and with
[00:15:08] full step, which is quicker 24 miles in the same number of hours.
[00:15:13] So these guys can march.
[00:15:15] These guys can march and we've talked a lot about foot patrols.
[00:15:19] And in the in the seal teams, there's something called a forced march, which is like you're
[00:15:24] on a road.
[00:15:25] There's no threat.
[00:15:26] You're just marching and you're trying to move from point eight to point B. Don't
[00:15:29] do a lot of that in the seal teams.
[00:15:31] You don't even do it really much in the, well, I can't say that.
[00:15:34] But there's a difference.
[00:15:35] That's a forced march.
[00:15:36] And then there's patrolling where you're tactical and you're scanning your field to
[00:15:42] fire.
[00:15:43] These guys are talking about a forced road march.
[00:15:45] You're just on the road.
[00:15:46] It's basically your, you're going as fast as you can.
[00:15:48] So you're, it's just like, maybe what you don't have a rider.
[00:15:51] I mean, in your case.
[00:15:52] Yeah, we'll never ride for whatever reason.
[00:15:55] Well, in the seal teams, we usually add a ride.
[00:15:57] That's what you don't do.
[00:15:58] Yeah, that's what we don't do.
[00:15:59] Yeah, that's what we don't do.
[00:16:00] Gotcha.
[00:16:01] Oh, here's a good one.
[00:16:04] Learn to swim every young soldier without exception should in the summer months be taught
[00:16:09] to swim for it is sometimes impossible to pass rivers on bridges, but the flying and pursuing
[00:16:16] army, both are often obliged to swim over them.
[00:16:20] A sudden melting of snow or fall of rain often makes them overflow their banks.
[00:16:25] And in such a situation, the danger is as great from ignorance in swimming as from the
[00:16:31] enemy.
[00:16:33] I kind of take it for granted that people know how to swim, but it is not true.
[00:16:38] And when I figured that out when I went to Navy Bootcamp, because you'd think if you were
[00:16:40] joining the Navy, you'd know how to swim.
[00:16:43] No, not true.
[00:16:44] Yeah.
[00:16:45] Not true at all.
[00:16:46] People did not know a decent amount of people.
[00:16:48] Did not know how to swim.
[00:16:50] Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:16:51] I'm sure you don't come from Kui where everyone knows how to swim.
[00:16:54] Even at like two years old people, you know, how to swim, because you're on the island.
[00:16:59] Yeah, it's all.
[00:17:00] But yeah, man, there's people.
[00:17:01] Straight up.
[00:17:02] You haven't even seen the water.
[00:17:03] You know, like the ocean or whatever.
[00:17:05] Well, there's definitely people that haven't seen the ocean.
[00:17:07] Yeah.
[00:17:08] I mean, when I went to, when I went to Sealtrain, there was guys that had never been to the
[00:17:11] ocean before.
[00:17:12] Yeah.
[00:17:13] They were from Iowa.
[00:17:14] Yeah.
[00:17:15] You know, no, they just salt-wise the water tastes salty.
[00:17:17] Yeah.
[00:17:18] Yeah.
[00:17:19] Yeah.
[00:17:20] So yeah.
[00:17:21] Parents, teacher, kids out of swim.
[00:17:22] They have those good programs now where they do the little floating programs.
[00:17:25] So like even a little baby can float themselves and stuff.
[00:17:28] But you can look that up on YouTube and learn how to teach you.
[00:17:32] You're like baby to swim.
[00:17:33] Yes.
[00:17:34] And be carefree.
[00:17:35] Yeah.
[00:17:36] I'm throwing the, what's that call?
[00:17:39] The safety tip.
[00:17:40] Yeah.
[00:17:41] The safety tip.
[00:17:42] Yeah.
[00:17:43] That's, you've got to, you know, when you're doing anything in the water, you've got to be
[00:17:45] careful, really careful.
[00:17:47] Yeah.
[00:17:48] Even when you're training in the water, you've got to be really careful.
[00:17:50] One up, one down is the rule.
[00:17:52] Like if one person's doing some training, someone's got to stand there and watch
[00:17:54] him.
[00:17:55] Make sure that they're safe.
[00:17:56] But yeah.
[00:17:57] If you don't know, swim, they'll never swim.
[00:18:01] Back to the book.
[00:18:03] No state can either be happy or secure that is remiss and negligent in the discipline of
[00:18:09] its troops.
[00:18:15] For it is not profusion of riches or excess of luxury that can influence our enemies
[00:18:20] to court or respect us.
[00:18:24] This can only be affected by the terror of our arms.
[00:18:30] It is an observation of Kato that misconduct in the common affairs of life may be retrieved,
[00:18:36] but that it is quite otherwise in war where errors are fatal and without remedy and are
[00:18:41] followed by immediate punishment.
[00:18:44] For the consequences of engaging an enemy without skill or courage, is that part of the
[00:18:50] army is left on the field of battle and those who remain received such an impression
[00:18:54] from their defeat that they dare not afterwards look the enemy in the face.
[00:19:00] It's powerful stuff right there.
[00:19:06] This can only be affected by the terror of our arms.
[00:19:11] It's underlying there's little underlying threats of violence and everything that
[00:19:16] passions say everything but they're just they're all.
[00:19:18] Let me let me break down a little bit more because I don't want to make a broad statement
[00:19:21] about the whole world.
[00:19:22] But when I was a young guy in a sea of opaltoon, it was definitely underlying threats
[00:19:26] of violence.
[00:19:27] Even with a big smile or face, even amongst total bros, the thing that's underlying
[00:19:32] is like, well, you know, if this is going down, you know, we know how that could go.
[00:19:40] So yeah, have the discipline.
[00:19:44] Train.
[00:19:45] I don't know why I'm finding this book like almost comical in how just on point it is with
[00:19:59] everything I think about.
[00:20:00] I kind of noticed that.
[00:20:01] Yeah, I'm just I mean the whole opening thing.
[00:20:03] The whole opening, the opening onslaught of discipline.
[00:20:09] You know, I was straight up into it.
[00:20:11] So back to the book to a custom soldiers to carry burdens is also an essential part of
[00:20:17] discipline.
[00:20:19] Recruiting particular should be obliged frequently to carry a weight of not less than 60
[00:20:24] pounds exclusive of their arms and to march with it in the ranks.
[00:20:29] This is because on difficult expeditions, they often find themselves under the necessity
[00:20:33] of carrying their provisions as well as their arms.
[00:20:35] Nor will they find this troublesome when in nerd to it by custom which makes everything
[00:20:40] easy.
[00:20:41] Boom, there you go.
[00:20:43] Where are the gear that you're where the gear that you're going to fight with?
[00:20:45] Get used to it.
[00:20:46] I used to talk about this with like discipline equals freedom.
[00:20:50] The whole idea of it.
[00:20:52] I'd say if you have a discipline to wear your gear all the time, then you'll have freedom
[00:20:56] movement when you need it.
[00:20:57] Right.
[00:20:58] You know, and I kind of felt like that was a stretch.
[00:21:00] Is that seem like a stretch?
[00:21:02] Well, no, no, no more.
[00:21:03] And anymore, this kind of, yeah, back into the non-stretch zone.
[00:21:07] Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:21:09] Because like, yeah, okay, so you have all your gear on, right?
[00:21:13] And Jody Middick was kind of talking about this.
[00:21:15] I think when you was like, oh man, you know, like, it was just a pain in the ass to wear
[00:21:19] and all this stuff.
[00:21:20] That feeling, you know, that's our real feeling.
[00:21:22] Man, this is a pain.
[00:21:23] Oh, this gear, this digging into my, you know, arm not used to it or kind of thing, but
[00:21:27] man, you get a guy who's really used to it by that's not even a factor.
[00:21:30] He's free to do that.
[00:21:31] There's two things that happens.
[00:21:32] Number one, you get used to it.
[00:21:33] Number two, you figure out your gear so that your gear works properly.
[00:21:36] Yeah, so it's like, yeah, you can.
[00:21:38] Because your gear when you first put it on no matter you go to the best gear store in
[00:21:44] the world and you buy gear and it's not going to fit you to quite right.
[00:21:47] You have to make little modifications.
[00:21:48] You have to adjust it.
[00:21:49] You have to put the weight somewhere else.
[00:21:50] Now in football, you wouldn't always wear your gear and practice, right?
[00:21:54] It was pretty designated.
[00:21:56] Like, depending on the day, you know, so, you know, two days, you have full gear, you know,
[00:21:59] two days, you have just helmets and shoulder pads or whatever.
[00:22:02] But yeah, you were, you were supposed to.
[00:22:05] One guy's would like maybe not wear their mouthpiece or something like that, but it'd
[00:22:10] be rare.
[00:22:11] I think in the NFL, like, they won't wear their thigh pads or their hip.
[00:22:15] And that's just because it's a pain.
[00:22:17] I don't know.
[00:22:18] I can't really speak for.
[00:22:20] I think I know that guys who run a lot and if you take out your thigh pads and your
[00:22:25] hip protectors and stuff, it helps you run for sure.
[00:22:28] But you run that risk.
[00:22:29] And you should train with it.
[00:22:31] You should train with it.
[00:22:32] But here's the thing, though.
[00:22:34] If there's a rule, because sometimes even in the game, they just won't wear it.
[00:22:37] They just simply won't wear it.
[00:22:39] But you do run the risk.
[00:22:41] Like, if you get what's called a hip pointer, there's an injury called a hip pointer.
[00:22:44] It's basically your external bleaks.
[00:22:46] They kind of overlap your hip bone, right?
[00:22:49] And when a helmet or something hits that and crushes your external bleak against your
[00:22:54] hip bones called a hip pointer.
[00:22:56] And it's a debilitating painful injury that kind of wear it, even in everyday life, you're
[00:23:03] out of the game.
[00:23:04] And I've had it before.
[00:23:06] So hip protectors will help against that.
[00:23:09] So you run that risk.
[00:23:11] So it's up to you, man.
[00:23:13] I mean, I think in college, I know in high school, it's a rule.
[00:23:16] You've got to wear a hip, but I think in the NFL you don't have to.
[00:23:20] Well, that's good.
[00:23:21] I think the overall point is, and it sounds like the football is on board with it.
[00:23:24] Train how you fight.
[00:23:25] Yeah.
[00:23:26] We're the gear.
[00:23:27] Train how you fight.
[00:23:28] But it's tough to go in, and this goes for any context that you're even, and really
[00:23:33] in the military, but it's almost like so obvious in the military that it's a given, where
[00:23:39] you can't train exactly how you fight.
[00:23:41] Yeah, sure.
[00:23:42] Yeah.
[00:23:43] And exactly, it's like I said, really.
[00:23:45] I used to tell guys that.
[00:23:46] I used to be like, hey, unfortunately, unfortunately, I can't put guys out here to actually
[00:23:51] kill you.
[00:23:52] You do the wrong way.
[00:23:53] Yeah, like you really want to do.
[00:23:55] Same thing for football as it turns out, where you can't just have guys going live
[00:24:01] five minutes a week.
[00:24:02] You know, on somebody hip pointers or you be, oh, yeah.
[00:24:04] Yeah.
[00:24:05] Actually, he's so he goes on to talk about, we talk about some slack.
[00:24:09] You're going back to the book.
[00:24:12] But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline.
[00:24:20] The soldiers began to think they're on or too heavy as they seldom put it on.
[00:24:25] They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the keras and afterwards the helmet
[00:24:31] and consequence of this are troops in their engagements with the Goths.
[00:24:36] We're often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows.
[00:24:40] So there you go.
[00:24:41] Start taking out a little shortcut.
[00:24:42] And like I always says, it's bi-pe greasep.
[00:24:44] Like no one just wakes up on the morning and says, I'm going to be weaker now.
[00:24:48] Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:49] It's over the floor.
[00:24:50] It's just, they just start to decay just a little bit.
[00:24:53] Yeah.
[00:24:54] Take a little shortcut.
[00:24:55] Yeah.
[00:24:56] You know, here's a, here's a, here's a workout.
[00:24:59] A workout tip.
[00:25:02] Jocos workout tips.
[00:25:04] I'm serious.
[00:25:05] This is like something that goes through my head.
[00:25:08] When I'm doing some exercise, let's say it's squat day.
[00:25:11] And let's say it's, I'm doing the 20 reps squats, which is just painful.
[00:25:15] Yes.
[00:25:16] And I have that thought in my head where sometimes you know, I go out and you know what?
[00:25:22] Just I'll just do 16 today.
[00:25:24] Yeah.
[00:25:25] Because you know, like, I mean, I worked really hard yesterday and I'm kind of tired.
[00:25:27] I'm still doing it until I did.
[00:25:29] Yeah.
[00:25:30] You know, I'm a bubble, I hear myself saying that.
[00:25:34] I always think like that's the, that's the first step down down the slippery slope.
[00:25:38] Okay.
[00:25:39] And I'm not going to do it.
[00:25:40] I'm not going to do it.
[00:25:41] Have you ever, I have you ever skipped it?
[00:25:43] Come on.
[00:25:44] Be real.
[00:25:45] Have you ever, have you ever skipped it?
[00:25:46] Like, you know, those doubts, not doubts, but those, those thoughts of, hey, let me, let me slack.
[00:25:52] Not skipping workout.
[00:25:53] I mean, have you ever given it?
[00:25:54] The only time where I've been like, you know what, I'm not finishing this workout is like
[00:25:59] I'll hurt something.
[00:26:00] Offer.
[00:26:01] And this way, and I've done it where I've done it where I haven't done it.
[00:26:05] That's a lesson learned.
[00:26:06] Like, I've been like, I remember one time on a squatting and I felt a little, you know, you
[00:26:09] know, you get a little twinge in your back.
[00:26:11] Yeah.
[00:26:12] I got one of those and then I kept going and then I was debilitated.
[00:26:15] I was like, I was like, not good.
[00:26:18] But generally, if, yeah, I know, because it's this, that's why I'm saying this.
[00:26:23] That little conversation right there is a good conversation.
[00:26:26] Have for yourself because I think about, I think about that little, you just give
[00:26:30] that little bit of slack that time and it's not good.
[00:26:35] You know, it's like that, just in my mind, I'm thinking that leads to more slack right
[00:26:39] there.
[00:26:40] It does.
[00:26:41] That leads to a little bit more slack.
[00:26:42] Because next time, you're going to feel that way at 15 reps instead of 16.
[00:26:46] Yeah, because you've, even if it's subconsciously, you established a new little, a
[00:26:51] person that's a precedent which is kind of just the standard.
[00:26:54] Just a little bit.
[00:26:55] Yeah, it's exactly.
[00:26:56] So it's like, it's different if you're undefeated.
[00:26:59] Right.
[00:27:00] If you're undefeated, you either undefeated or you're not undefeated kind of thing.
[00:27:04] Once you're defeated, then you're kind of like, okay, you know, let it sneak in there.
[00:27:07] Yeah.
[00:27:08] It's part of you now.
[00:27:09] Yeah.
[00:27:10] I got to say I'm defeated.
[00:27:11] I'm like, I do the, I do the met kind at the end.
[00:27:14] You know, I live and do met kind and it's, you know, good.
[00:27:17] And I will also straight up, I'll be honest that it doesn't happen very often.
[00:27:21] I mean, I talk a lot of trash water, but it doesn't happen very often.
[00:27:25] But oh, yeah, there's times where it'll be like, oh, well, that work out was pretty solid.
[00:27:29] I'll do, I'll make deals.
[00:27:31] That makes me, that makes me mad.
[00:27:33] That makes me mad.
[00:27:34] And I don't like that.
[00:27:36] Actually hanging with you made me give me that mindset, which is a mindset I simply
[00:27:42] did not have.
[00:27:43] Go deaf core.
[00:27:44] No, but you know how you said it makes you mad.
[00:27:47] Like, I never had that feeling.
[00:27:48] Never had that feeling like, oh, I'm making it.
[00:27:51] I just never thought of it that way.
[00:27:52] Like not even a little bit.
[00:27:53] Do you mean consider thinking it that way?
[00:27:55] But now, yeah, when I feel it, like, oh, maybe I'll do tomorrow.
[00:27:58] Really don't feel, I actually have that response.
[00:28:01] Where you kind of get mad at it at yourself trying to think, like you're split into
[00:28:05] people.
[00:28:06] That's a positive thing.
[00:28:07] It is.
[00:28:08] It helps.
[00:28:09] That's the death core right there.
[00:28:10] Straight up.
[00:28:12] Check.
[00:28:13] All right.
[00:28:15] Let's see.
[00:28:16] Going back to the book, it was a constant custom among the old Romans to exercise
[00:28:21] both cavalry and infantry three times a month by marches of a certain length.
[00:28:28] The foot were obliged to march completely armed.
[00:28:31] The distance of 10 miles from the camp and return in the most exact order and with the
[00:28:36] military step, which they changed and quickened on some part of the march.
[00:28:41] They made these marches not in plain and even ground only, but both cavalry and infantry were
[00:28:48] ordered into difficult and uneven places and to ascend or descend mountains to prepare
[00:28:53] them for all kinds of accidents and familiarize them with the different maneuvers that
[00:28:59] various situations of a country may require.
[00:29:03] It has put some miles in.
[00:29:05] But again, the reason that I wanted to mention that part is it's not just about wearing
[00:29:11] the gear, it's trying to simulate as closely as you can to the situation that you're going
[00:29:16] to be in.
[00:29:18] Same thing with anything, same thing with sports, same thing with business when you're
[00:29:21] training someone, when you're training someone for business, put them in that situation
[00:29:27] that they as close as you can to what they're going to be in.
[00:29:32] Here it continues to enumerate the different nations.
[00:29:36] So formidable of old, all which now are subject to the Romans would be tedious.
[00:29:41] So he's saying like, we beat down so many people we can't, but I'm going to take the time
[00:29:45] to talk about them all.
[00:29:48] But the security established by long peace has altered their dispositions, drawn them
[00:29:53] off from military to civil pursuits and infused into them a love of idolness and ease.
[00:30:01] Again, this guy's right in several hundred years after Caesar.
[00:30:06] So he's talking about the slippery slope.
[00:30:11] Hence a relaxation of military discipline, insensibly ensued, then in a collective it and
[00:30:18] it sunk at last into entire oblivion.
[00:30:25] So he's watching the fall of the Roman Empire and where does it start?
[00:30:31] It's a discipline in the troops, boom, I'll get the kick out of this button.
[00:30:38] The necessity therefore of discipline cannot be too often incoated as well as the strict
[00:30:44] attention, requisite in the choice and training of new levees.
[00:30:49] Don't you can't ever, can't ever let up the psyche, can't ever say it's okay not to do
[00:30:56] that rep.
[00:30:57] That's, in the book he goes into a long description of how they were organized, like
[00:31:10] man by man, troop by troop, not going to go too deep into that.
[00:31:16] One of the things he does mention in that section is about how when they stopped doing a good
[00:31:21] job replacing the soldiers that were leaving, you know, you're not keeping, you're not
[00:31:25] keeping people coming in, not keeping them trained up.
[00:31:30] This is a good thing.
[00:31:31] I think this is good for any team situation.
[00:31:33] The expense of keeping up good or bad troops is the same.
[00:31:41] But it depends wholly on you.
[00:31:42] So I think that's a good statement.
[00:31:45] You got some good members on your team, you got some bad members on the team.
[00:31:49] It cost you the same to keep them.
[00:31:53] You got to decide how you're going to manage that situation.
[00:32:03] Back to the book.
[00:32:04] In former times, the discipline was so strict that the tribunes or officers not only
[00:32:10] cause the troops under their command to be exercised daily in their presence, but were
[00:32:15] themselves so perfect in their military exercise as to set them by example.
[00:32:22] Something does so much honor to the abilities or application of the tribune as the appearance
[00:32:28] and discipline of the soldiers.
[00:32:31] When their apparel is neat and clean, their arms bright and in good order and when they
[00:32:36] perform their exercises and evolutions with the austerity.
[00:32:43] No big deal.
[00:32:51] More.
[00:32:53] He's talking about just keeping the elements organized in a combat situation.
[00:33:02] Lest the soldiers in the confusion of battle should be separated from their comrades
[00:33:06] every cohort had its shield painted in a manner peculiar to itself.
[00:33:11] The name of each soldier was also written on a shield together with the number of the
[00:33:16] cohort and century to which he belonged.
[00:33:23] I had a note in here about how we would name our vehicles.
[00:33:28] So you'd know what vehicle to get into.
[00:33:30] The armies would have names.
[00:33:32] So you'd know what vehicle was yours.
[00:33:33] Well, the one called Zev.
[00:33:34] Yes, they had all kinds of names for him.
[00:33:37] My first deployment to Iraq.
[00:33:41] They were named after the movie.
[00:33:47] Oh, movie.
[00:33:48] They were named after a movie.
[00:33:50] It's about bowling, but it's not the big lebaoski.
[00:33:53] Kingpin.
[00:33:54] It was kingpin.
[00:33:55] That was the name.
[00:33:56] The other one.
[00:33:57] It was one of the homivies was called Bigger.
[00:33:59] Now what's interesting is the homivies originally were not named.
[00:34:03] They were numbered.
[00:34:04] One, two, three, four, five, six and that seems like a pretty square to weigh like a
[00:34:07] jockel would be good with that.
[00:34:08] Just give them a number.
[00:34:09] Here's a problem with it.
[00:34:11] When you're going on an operation, you go into a building to do a take down of a building.
[00:34:17] The vehicles move around.
[00:34:18] They got to adjust.
[00:34:19] And when you come back out, they might not necessarily be an orger numerically.
[00:34:23] So guys, but guys would go one, two, three.
[00:34:25] Oh, that's my vehicle.
[00:34:26] So they're getting along vehicle, which might not seem like a big deal.
[00:34:29] But then when you're trying to get a head count and someone's not the right vehicle,
[00:34:32] then the vehicle commander's like, I'm supposed to have eight guys and I only have seven.
[00:34:36] Now we're sitting on the X trying to get a head count.
[00:34:39] And that's problematic.
[00:34:41] If you know what your name of your vehicle is, you confirm it.
[00:34:44] They're written on the side.
[00:34:44] Nice big letters.
[00:34:45] Yeah.
[00:34:46] Looking for big earn.
[00:34:47] You see it?
[00:34:48] You jump in.
[00:34:49] It makes sense with the numbers.
[00:34:51] Because I think just by nature, we assign numbers to things for all kinds of weird reasons.
[00:34:57] You know, like, where if there's three things in a room, like if I see, okay, there's
[00:35:00] three bottles in a row, mean you don't even have to know each other.
[00:35:03] And I say, hey, grab the third bottle.
[00:35:05] It's kind of, there's a shirt.
[00:35:06] There's a kind of ambiguous understanding.
[00:35:07] Okay, then want to further this one on the right.
[00:35:09] You know, it's like that. So the numbers can jam you.
[00:35:11] Well, we numbered this podcast.
[00:35:13] Yeah, because it's like chronological.
[00:35:15] Yeah.
[00:35:16] So interestingly, they could have had just names.
[00:35:19] Yeah.
[00:35:20] In fact, maybe they should have.
[00:35:21] Remember when the UFC's used to be numbered?
[00:35:23] Yeah.
[00:35:24] Or they're numbered.
[00:35:26] And then there's all no one was.
[00:35:28] This is what I was thinking.
[00:35:29] They used to give them a number.
[00:35:31] And then they would have like a crazy name.
[00:35:32] Yeah, yeah, the title.
[00:35:33] Like that.
[00:35:34] Fetch and so I actually did.
[00:35:35] And then some glory or whatever.
[00:35:37] And then they just started just calling them the names of the guys
[00:35:40] that were fighting.
[00:35:40] Yeah.
[00:35:41] Which makes sense once you have, that's kind of what I'm thinking
[00:35:44] right now.
[00:35:45] Like someone that's looking for a certain episode.
[00:35:49] Yeah.
[00:35:50] They would, they might not remember the number,
[00:35:52] but they remembered the book or they remember the person.
[00:35:54] Yeah.
[00:35:55] That's kind of interesting.
[00:35:56] But we do kind of do it like that.
[00:35:57] Yeah, we kind of love.
[00:35:59] Yeah, one, what is, is there value to having a number
[00:36:02] aside from keeping a count of how many episodes there are?
[00:36:06] Well, I think someone now can, if you know what one you're looking
[00:36:11] for and then you find it, then you can go and find it easy
[00:36:15] in your platform.
[00:36:17] But the easiest way, if you want to know what,
[00:36:19] because sometimes I don't remember what a particular,
[00:36:21] if you Google, Jocco, podcast, and then whatever thing
[00:36:26] that you're looking for, it'll take you to the YouTube video.
[00:36:30] Right.
[00:36:31] It'll take you to the YouTube video.
[00:36:32] Yeah, because the YouTube videos are put the,
[00:36:35] somebody just told me on, on, somebody said,
[00:36:38] hey, you should review this book, Maurice Stradgercon.
[00:36:42] Stradgercon.
[00:36:43] Stradgercon, yeah.
[00:36:45] And I said, you should review this book.
[00:36:48] And this guy's like been in the game for a while.
[00:36:51] And I said, you should check out podcast,
[00:36:53] and I did it right away.
[00:36:54] Number one, so I Googled Jocco, Stradgercon.
[00:36:57] And I found 57, boom, done.
[00:37:01] So now you can say, for the 70s, you go back
[00:37:02] and then look, right?
[00:37:03] Yeah.
[00:37:04] Check.
[00:37:07] All right.
[00:37:07] Talking about drilling the troops back to the book,
[00:37:10] the younger soldiers and recruits went through
[00:37:12] their drills of every kind, every morning and afternoon,
[00:37:15] and the veterans and most expert regularly once a day.
[00:37:21] Length of service or age alone will never form a military man.
[00:37:27] For after serving many years, an undisciplined soldier
[00:37:31] is still a novice in his profession.
[00:37:37] By practice, only can be acquired a guilty of body
[00:37:42] and the skill requisite to engage an enemy
[00:37:45] with advantage, especially in a close fight.
[00:37:50] But the most essential point of all is to teach soldiers
[00:37:53] to keep their ranks and never abandon their colors
[00:37:55] in the most difficult evolutions.
[00:37:57] Thus men thus trained are never at a loss amidst
[00:38:01] the greatest confusion of numbers.
[00:38:05] The recruits likewise are to be exercised
[00:38:07] with wooden swords at the post,
[00:38:09] to be taught to attack this imaginary antagonist
[00:38:11] on all sides into aim at the side to feet or head,
[00:38:15] both with the point and edge of the sword.
[00:38:18] I think some of those movies that came out,
[00:38:26] because this is in sound glorious to me.
[00:38:29] Maybe it doesn't do you, but to me, that sounds awesome.
[00:38:31] And then like movies like Brave Heart,
[00:38:34] where they're showing kind of the sword battles
[00:38:37] and how just psycho it was.
[00:38:39] I think that's a good reminder.
[00:38:41] Yeah, big time. Back to the book, in short,
[00:38:48] both Legionary and Arggzilla Retroops should continually be drilled
[00:38:56] in cutting wood, carrying burdens, passing ditches, swimming in the sea
[00:39:00] or rivers, marching in the full step and even running with their arms
[00:39:04] and baggage so that in order to labor in peace,
[00:39:08] they may find no difficulty in war.
[00:39:13] Four, as the well-trained soldier is eager for action,
[00:39:17] so does the untot fear it.
[00:39:23] In war, discipline is superior to strength.
[00:39:27] But if that discipline is neglected,
[00:39:29] there is no longer any difference between the soldier and the peasant.
[00:39:33] The old maxim is certain that the very essence of an art
[00:39:40] consists in constant practice.
[00:39:48] Yeah, discipline is superior to strength.
[00:39:56] This is a solid book.
[00:39:58] The art, the very essence of an art consists in constant practice.
[00:40:05] So whatever it is, you want to be good at.
[00:40:07] Yeah. That's how you get good at it.
[00:40:09] Lately I just wrote another book.
[00:40:11] We've been writing a lot.
[00:40:13] I've been writing a ton, and you can see,
[00:40:15] the first draft was probably five times better than our first draft
[00:40:19] of our first book.
[00:40:21] And we both have done a lot of writing in the military,
[00:40:25] you know, in college and all that, but you practice,
[00:40:28] you get better.
[00:40:31] Jiu Jitsu, guess what, you practice, you get better.
[00:40:36] Pull ups.
[00:40:37] You're going to pull ups, do pull ups.
[00:40:43] Here we go.
[00:40:46] The last demonians made war their chief study.
[00:40:51] They affirmed to be the first who reasoned on the events of battles
[00:40:56] and committed their observations there on to writing
[00:40:59] with such success as to reduce the military art
[00:41:02] before considered as totally dependent on courage or fortune
[00:41:06] to contain two certain rules and fixed principles.
[00:41:13] As a consequence, they established schools of tactics
[00:41:16] for the instruction of youth in all the maneuvers of war.
[00:41:21] How worthy of admiration are these people
[00:41:24] for particularly applying themselves to the study of an art
[00:41:29] without which no other art can possibly exist?
[00:41:34] Boom.
[00:41:37] That's interesting.
[00:41:39] It's interesting, can you imagine it? Well, for me,
[00:41:41] you know, actually, I can't imagine.
[00:41:43] When you're a kid, you think like war is just like,
[00:41:47] just charge.
[00:41:48] And then as soon as you get into the teams,
[00:41:51] you're like, oh, there's maneuvers you can do.
[00:41:53] There's things you need to make happen.
[00:41:55] There's ways you can get advantage.
[00:41:57] It's not just what they call it, courage or fortune.
[00:41:59] It's not just that at all.
[00:42:00] There's a whole lot of things involved.
[00:42:02] And it's also interesting that they were doing,
[00:42:04] they were doing studies and debriefs on the war,
[00:42:09] on the battles.
[00:42:10] Because it sounds like people weren't, and he says, hey, look,
[00:42:13] they were the first two reasoned on the events of battles
[00:42:15] and committed their observations they're on to writing,
[00:42:17] with such a success to figure out that there's a military art.
[00:42:24] And how fired up is it that
[00:42:31] to study this art of war without which no other art can possibly exist?
[00:42:37] Two strong for you?
[00:42:40] You're not strong for every strong.
[00:42:43] I can see that's a bold statement for sure.
[00:42:46] It's a real bold statement.
[00:42:47] I don't think I thought about it enough to offer any sort of opinion.
[00:42:51] No, I'm the deal, but hey, man, I dig it.
[00:42:54] Kind of like exercise in life, right?
[00:42:56] Or healthy in life.
[00:42:57] Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:58] But yeah, sure.
[00:42:59] Cool.
[00:43:00] You seem pretty fired up a bit.
[00:43:02] You seem pretty fired up a bit.
[00:43:03] You do.
[00:43:05] And this is where George Washington statement kind of paraphrased from.
[00:43:10] Back to the book, he, therefore, who desires peace,
[00:43:14] should prepare for war.
[00:43:18] He who aspires to victory should spare no pains to form his soldiers.
[00:43:24] And he who hopes for success should fight on principle, not chance.
[00:43:29] No one dares to offend or insult a power of known superiority in action.
[00:43:41] You get bummed out that unit learn this in third grade, like this whole thing.
[00:43:47] Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, including Jiu Jitsu for sure.
[00:43:51] Yeah, well, yeah.
[00:43:53] I feel like you kind of, I learned this kind of from you in the beginning,
[00:43:59] where, you know, how you have this kind of big picture kind of mindset.
[00:44:02] And I liked it.
[00:44:03] The long game, you always like, you always correct me when I have this, like,
[00:44:07] sort of certain term.
[00:44:08] Yeah.
[00:44:09] That's what I wish I understood slash even.
[00:44:12] I don't know if kids are even capable.
[00:44:14] Yeah.
[00:44:14] Really?
[00:44:15] Well, no, you're 100% right.
[00:44:17] And I've actually said this many times that kids have a hard time.
[00:44:22] Connecting what they're doing now with where it puts them in the future.
[00:44:27] And I say kids and by kids, I mean me, everyone.
[00:44:31] Yeah.
[00:44:32] I mean, I'm better now.
[00:44:33] Yeah.
[00:44:33] But when you're, when you're a kid, like it made, and kids, some kids are different.
[00:44:38] You know, like some of my, some of the kids that my kids hang around with,
[00:44:43] some of them are dialed, where they've just got a vision.
[00:44:46] They know where they're going.
[00:44:47] They know where they're going.
[00:44:48] They know where they're going to be in eight years.
[00:44:49] They know what they want to do.
[00:44:50] That's not a majority of the kids.
[00:44:53] Most kids are, you know, like, well, hey, I can get this right now.
[00:44:58] And that's cool.
[00:44:59] And they don't think about how it's going to affect when the future.
[00:45:01] And that's, that's, that's just really problematic.
[00:45:04] Yeah.
[00:45:05] Not understanding that long game is really problematic.
[00:45:08] And I think we do a bad job of teaching it as parents and as teachers and as a society.
[00:45:15] Yeah.
[00:45:16] Yeah.
[00:45:17] Okay.
[00:45:18] Well, I mean, there's, because you have, you know, like,
[00:45:23] JP says this and, and Laced this where when I was a kid,
[00:45:28] even you say you want to be some sort of a commando.
[00:45:30] Yeah.
[00:45:31] At least you had like an idea, you know, so there's, at the very least,
[00:45:35] somewhat in your mind to be like, hey, for sure.
[00:45:37] If I do this, that was, that was a savior.
[00:45:40] Yeah.
[00:45:41] So I think some families just through tradition and stuff like that,
[00:45:45] they'll have that structure.
[00:45:47] Hey, you're up.
[00:45:48] I don't know.
[00:45:49] You're a Johnson.
[00:45:50] So you do this, X, Y, Z.
[00:45:51] And it's just a matter of getting the kid to embrace that,
[00:45:54] which it's really kind of like, either they do it.
[00:45:56] They know all the tasks.
[00:45:57] Yeah.
[00:45:58] I mean, I think if you're fair to your kids, because a lot of times,
[00:46:02] like, we get caught up in like our own feelings, you know,
[00:46:05] in this thing like, you know, I don't know.
[00:46:07] You kids not listen to you or some like that.
[00:46:08] You're like, oh, my kids not listening to me.
[00:46:10] You know, you get caught up in the feeling that emotions.
[00:46:13] Yeah.
[00:46:14] You know, that rather than, hey, you know,
[00:46:16] this is a problem that needs to be solved to kind of thing.
[00:46:18] So I think that's the way you can alienate your kids real easy.
[00:46:22] And it's a common thing.
[00:46:23] I think where, you know, well alienator kids,
[00:46:26] and then they won't embrace the pride and tradition of your family.
[00:46:30] Because they're like alienated.
[00:46:31] You alienated.
[00:46:32] You alienated me.
[00:46:33] One way or another.
[00:46:34] Sometimes you don't even know you alienated.
[00:46:35] You know, they're like, oh, he's in a rebellious phase.
[00:46:37] You know, like, sure, there is such thing as a rebellious kind of phase.
[00:46:41] Yeah, you know, sure.
[00:46:42] And they gather this or they gain the sense of like empowerment in certain ways.
[00:46:46] You know, they want to test it out.
[00:46:47] They want to test about it.
[00:46:48] Yeah.
[00:46:48] You know, that, it's a concept that they know.
[00:46:50] They got to break away from their parents.
[00:46:51] That's something they got to start practicing that.
[00:46:53] Yeah.
[00:46:53] It seems, it seems natural.
[00:46:55] But if you have successfully alienated your kid,
[00:46:58] when that rebellious phase comes,
[00:47:00] they're stepping right outside the game.
[00:47:02] They're starting their own thing.
[00:47:03] In fact, they're going to have some resentment against
[00:47:05] Dad who's this unfair tyrant who's lame.
[00:47:08] Heaps this.
[00:47:09] It's just stuff like the kids never think their parents know anything.
[00:47:13] No, no, no.
[00:47:14] You know, as a parent, I understand why I totally don't like,
[00:47:17] I say, I get it.
[00:47:18] No, but that is funny.
[00:47:20] That is pretty funny.
[00:47:21] I mean, we just don't.
[00:47:22] It's not just parents.
[00:47:23] Like your teachers don't know anything.
[00:47:24] I'm not speaking for everybody, but like when I was a kid,
[00:47:26] parents didn't know anything.
[00:47:28] Teachers didn't know anything.
[00:47:29] I knew everything.
[00:47:30] Much of darks.
[00:47:30] Much of idiots.
[00:47:31] God, I'm stupid.
[00:47:33] So if you're listening to this and you're,
[00:47:36] you know, under the age of 40,
[00:47:38] you might want to listen to your.
[00:47:41] All right.
[00:47:42] That's good stuff.
[00:47:43] He who desires peace should prepare for war.
[00:47:45] Remember that one.
[00:47:48] Back to the book.
[00:47:52] And army to numerous.
[00:47:54] So now he's talking about the size of the army.
[00:47:56] The army to numerous is subject to many dangers and inconveniences.
[00:47:59] Its bulk makes its slow and unwieldy in its motions.
[00:48:03] And it is obliged to march and columns of great length.
[00:48:06] That is exposed to the risk of being continually harassed and insulted by
[00:48:10] inconsiderable parties of the enemy.
[00:48:13] The enumy, the enumy of the baggage is often an occasion of its being
[00:48:18] surprised in its passage throughout difficult places or over rivers.
[00:48:23] The difficulty of providing forage for such numbers of horses and other beasts of burden is very
[00:48:29] great.
[00:48:30] Besides the scarcity of provisions,
[00:48:33] which is to be carefully guarded against in all expeditions,
[00:48:38] soon ruin such large armies with the consumption.
[00:48:42] It's so great that notwithstanding the greatest care and filling the magazines,
[00:48:47] they must begin to fail in a short time.
[00:48:49] And sometimes they unavoidably will be distressed for want of water.
[00:48:53] But if unfortunately this immense army should be defeated,
[00:48:56] the numbers lost must necessarily be very great.
[00:48:59] And the remainder who save themselves by flight too much
[00:49:03] disperited to be brought to action again.
[00:49:07] And I read that whole thing so I could read this,
[00:49:10] which is saying hey, like you get too many people.
[00:49:12] I read that whole thing so I could read this.
[00:49:14] The ancients taught by experience,
[00:49:18] preferred discipline to numbers.
[00:49:21] Like we'd rather just have a small square away group than a ton of guys.
[00:49:27] So where I see this with businesses, this is what businesses.
[00:49:31] Is as businesses grow,
[00:49:33] it becomes harder for them to turn, right?
[00:49:36] It's harder for them to pivot.
[00:49:38] Oh yeah, yeah, so you get big companies that when they were small,
[00:49:42] they were all agile and they were making things happen and they can change direction.
[00:49:45] And then as they get bigger and bigger and bigger, they lose the ability to do that.
[00:49:48] And so you got to pay attention to that.
[00:49:50] And what you have to do, there's a couple of solutions.
[00:49:53] It's like the solution is yeah, you can stay small,
[00:49:56] but you don't want to spend it's day small as a business because you can't just like, you know,
[00:49:59] it's coldest, stay small as an army, but there's only so much you can do with limited number of people.
[00:50:03] So what you have to do is you have to start to become more aware of what's going,
[00:50:08] what's going, what's coming down the pipe in the future.
[00:50:11] Because it's going to take longer for you to pivot this big monster you've got.
[00:50:15] Yeah.
[00:50:16] So you've got to do it.
[00:50:17] You've got to pay more attention.
[00:50:19] So when you grow in size,
[00:50:21] this is classic.
[00:50:22] When you grow in size, a business,
[00:50:26] if the leaders of the business continue to focus down and in to the company,
[00:50:32] they won't see what's coming over the horizon.
[00:50:36] And that's when they get caught off guard and now they don't have time to pivot because they're a lot bigger.
[00:50:40] But they used to get away with it because they were a little small company.
[00:50:42] They could come to work on Monday and they could talk to everyone and one sitting and everyone gets on board and we move forward.
[00:50:47] You fast forward that and you go from 50 employees to 500.
[00:50:50] That are now spread out over a large geography.
[00:50:55] You can't make that quick move.
[00:50:57] And so what you have to do as a leader as you grow,
[00:51:00] you need to adjust your frame of vision from looking down inside your company to looking up and into the future.
[00:51:06] If you don't make that transition, you can't.
[00:51:09] You think you can turn things quickly.
[00:51:11] You can't.
[00:51:12] You can't.
[00:51:13] It's a big army and a big army has to be.
[00:51:16] It's hard to control a big army and it takes more lead time.
[00:51:19] And so that's the focus that you have to adjust to as you grow.
[00:51:25] Yes, good to have fun.
[00:51:27] So how do you do it then?
[00:51:29] Like you as the.
[00:51:30] Well, what you do is you have people underneath you.
[00:51:33] If you're making widgets and I wasn't, we started off.
[00:51:35] We had eight people and I was in the factory all day checking out your widgets and making sure that they were good to go.
[00:51:40] And I was testing them myself and I was making little adjustments.
[00:51:43] That's cool.
[00:51:44] That's fine.
[00:51:45] It works when we had eight people.
[00:51:46] But now when we get 40 people, I need to start going, okay, echo.
[00:51:49] Can you pay attention to widgets in here?
[00:51:51] And then when I get to 300 people, I need to have four or five echoes that are down there that are watching this stuff.
[00:51:56] So that's what you got to do.
[00:51:57] You got to adjust your field of vision.
[00:51:58] You got to adjust your focus or all to you.
[00:52:00] And what fools people, what fools people, what catches them off guard is that they think they can still pivot quickly.
[00:52:09] Because they were able to do it when they were smaller when they had 30 or 40 people.
[00:52:13] They were able to pivot quickly.
[00:52:14] They got 300, they can't do it.
[00:52:16] And they get caught off guard.
[00:52:18] Here, watch out for that.
[00:52:20] Kind of like a big cruise ship.
[00:52:22] Kind of like a little speed boat.
[00:52:23] Of course.
[00:52:24] Of course.
[00:52:24] Like this.
[00:52:24] Of course.
[00:52:25] Those things take miles to turn.
[00:52:27] Miles.
[00:52:28] Those big oil tankers, they take miles to stop.
[00:52:31] Back to the book.
[00:52:32] The excellence of their discipline made their small army sufficient to encounter all their enemies with success.
[00:52:37] Now, this is something else I see a lot in business world.
[00:52:41] And this is very common, right? You get the big, the big business, the big gorilla in the room or whatever.
[00:52:48] And they can't pivot very quickly.
[00:52:50] Well, then you get the smaller companies that are very agile.
[00:52:53] And they start picking away at the big guy.
[00:52:55] That's what he's talking about right here.
[00:52:56] Like, just because you're small doesn't mean you can't.
[00:52:58] You can't take a shot at the title.
[00:53:00] You know, you could move quickly.
[00:53:02] And if there's chaos going on, that's when you can adapt.
[00:53:05] Now, are they advantageous to being the big company with lots of money and lots of people in your very stable?
[00:53:09] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:10] So, and are there advantageous to being small?
[00:53:13] Yes, there are the mistake that people on both sides make is they view themselves.
[00:53:19] They don't understand what their strengths and weaknesses are.
[00:53:22] And they don't understand the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents, right?
[00:53:25] So they say, if there's someone that can move quicker than them, they go, don't worry about them.
[00:53:28] We're bigger and more stable.
[00:53:29] Well, those people are maneuvering on you.
[00:53:31] Yeah.
[00:53:31] And there's a little needles in your feet.
[00:53:33] And eventually those little needles get infected and there's a problem.
[00:53:36] Yeah.
[00:53:36] You know, situation going on. So you have to constantly as a leader and again,
[00:53:41] this is why leadership is important.
[00:53:43] You have to, as a leader need to assess what's the strength of that group.
[00:53:46] What's the weaknesses?
[00:53:47] What are our strengths, right?
[00:53:49] We keep hearing this again over and over again throughout all these ancient military leaders.
[00:53:53] Know yourself. Know your opponent.
[00:53:55] Know your strengths. Know your weaknesses.
[00:53:57] For sure.
[00:53:58] People fail to do that.
[00:54:00] Yeah.
[00:54:00] Problematic.
[00:54:07] Here we go.
[00:54:09] Famine makes greater havoc in an army than the enemy.
[00:54:14] And is more terrible than the sword.
[00:54:17] You know, every time we've read that in last couple of books, people talking about how it's better to starve your enemy.
[00:54:24] Just makes me really, really thankful that there's abundant food in this country right now.
[00:54:31] It really does.
[00:54:32] I mean, I've never been starving and can you imagine starving to death?
[00:54:38] It's got to be absolutely heinous.
[00:54:41] Yeah.
[00:54:42] Worst than the sword, according to the Gettius.
[00:54:47] An army drawn together from different parts sometimes is disposed to mutate.
[00:54:52] And the troops, though not inclined to fight, pretend to be angry at not being led against the enemy.
[00:54:58] Such seditious dispositions, Prince Berley's, Prince Berley, show themselves in those who have lived in their quarters in idleness and a feminacy.
[00:55:08] These men on a custom to the necessary fatigue of the field are disgusted at its severity.
[00:55:15] Their ignorance of discipline makes them afraid of action and inspires them with insurgency.
[00:55:21] So you let your, it's one of those, it's one of those dichotomies.
[00:55:32] That's what it is.
[00:55:33] If you let your people do whatever they want to pick it soft, then they start to rebel.
[00:55:37] You want to talk about kids, you know, let your kids do whatever you want or whatever they want.
[00:55:41] And see how that works out for you.
[00:55:43] Lack of discipline to your kids, you can end up with some rebellious kids.
[00:55:46] Yes.
[00:55:47] Now, am I saying that you need to beat them like a dog?
[00:55:51] Intestimition? No, I'm not saying that at all.
[00:55:53] Because you know what that dog is? That dog's crazy. That dog will bite you at some point.
[00:55:57] Yep. Right?
[00:55:58] Or somebody else.
[00:55:59] Or somebody else.
[00:56:00] Yeah.
[00:56:00] It's problematic.
[00:56:01] So you have to find the balance between those two things.
[00:56:04] He says there's several remedies for this evil.
[00:56:09] Let them be constantly employed either in the field days or in the inspection of their arms.
[00:56:16] They should not be allowed to be absent on furlough.
[00:56:19] They should be frequently called by role and trained to be exact in observance of every signal.
[00:56:23] Let them be exercised in the use of the bow and throwing missile weapons and stones.
[00:56:27] Both with the hand and sling.
[00:56:29] And then with the wooden stored sword at the post.
[00:56:33] Let them be let all of this be continually repeated and let them be often kept under arms until they are tired.
[00:56:40] Let them be exercised and running and leaping to facilitate the passing of ditches.
[00:56:45] And if their quarters are near the sea or the river, let them all without exception be obliged in the summer to have the frequent practice of swimming.
[00:56:54] Let them be accustomed to march.
[00:56:57] March through thickets and closures and broken grounds to fell trees and to cut out timber to break ground and defend a post against their comrades who are in a deiver to dispossess them.
[00:57:08] And in the encounter each party should use their shields to dislodge and bear down their antagonists.
[00:57:16] All the different kinds of troops thus trained and exercised in their quarters will find themselves inspired.
[00:57:24] With emulation for glory and eagerness for action when they come to take the field.
[00:57:31] In short a soldier who has proper confidence in his own skill and strength entertains no thought of mutiny.
[00:57:40] That's awesome.
[00:57:42] Yeah, these guys were doing force on force training.
[00:57:45] He's saying look, you're not going to use swords but you're going to go against each other with your shields and fight for it.
[00:57:51] And this is a get I've answered that question a bunch of times where people, you know, how do you build morale in your team?
[00:57:57] It's like make them train hard, make them work hard.
[00:58:00] Now the real trick is to make them train hard, make them work hard but at the same time what you do is you give them ownership of that training.
[00:58:07] So they're running the training.
[00:58:09] They come up with the ideas and you just respect the hardcore training that they're doing and you do it with them.
[00:58:16] You don't just impoth.
[00:58:18] It's different than just imposing on the team like we're going to do this hardcore training.
[00:58:22] That won't create a mutiny if you're not careful.
[00:58:26] Especially if you're not out there doing it with them or if you don't explain why it's important.
[00:58:31] I read this thing.
[00:58:33] This is to kind of add to that.
[00:58:34] Well, I think so anyway.
[00:58:36] They think I'm a foul.
[00:58:38] I forgot what it was but it said and allow for success.
[00:58:41] So like when you train you know you train our train hard but allow for success.
[00:58:46] For sure because if there's no success it's like morale goes down after a while.
[00:58:49] Yeah, something like this.
[00:58:50] For sure.
[00:58:51] You can't just let it sit.
[00:58:52] I just said you can't beat that dog.
[00:58:53] Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:54] You can't beat that dog.
[00:58:57] It is much more to the credit of a general to form his troops to submission and no
[00:59:03] obedience by habit and discipline than to be obliged to force them to their duty by the terror of punishment.
[00:59:10] So he's making the reason I point that out is because it's making a clear,
[00:59:15] a clear delineation between discipline and punishment.
[00:59:20] Like discipline good punishment bad and he's saying those are two kind of opposite things.
[00:59:23] So I think that's very important.
[00:59:25] Things go to you.
[00:59:26] And it's important to remember that you're treating your people good.
[00:59:31] You're taking care of them.
[00:59:32] That's what you're doing.
[00:59:33] You don't necessarily take care of them by making their life soft.
[00:59:38] You take care of them by making their life discipline and hard.
[00:59:42] Not to beat them down.
[00:59:43] There's a balance.
[00:59:44] But that's what you got to find.
[00:59:46] Yeah.
[00:59:47] Back to the book.
[00:59:49] It is essential to know the character of the enemy and the enemy.
[00:59:52] And of their principal officers, whether they be raster, cautious,
[00:59:56] Enterprising or timid, whether they fight on principle or from chance and whether the nations they have been engaged with were brave or cowardly.
[01:00:04] So again, know your enemy.
[01:00:07] You must by no means venture to lead and it resolute or dividend army to a general engagement for soldiers,
[01:00:17] unused to fighting for a length of time must be considered in the same light as recruits.
[01:00:24] So you say, and if you got people that haven't fought in a while and they're a little bit nervous,
[01:00:28] then you got to figure that they're just like recruits.
[01:00:31] You can't always trust them.
[01:00:35] And then he talks about the general and says, if he finds himself in many respects superior to his adverts, adversary,
[01:00:42] he must by no means defer bringing on the engagement.
[01:00:46] So if you're in a better spot than the enemy or you can take them, go.
[01:00:50] But if he knows himself inferior, he must avoid general actions and endeavor to succeed by surprises and strategies.
[01:00:57] This one skillfully managed by good generals have often given them victory over enemies superior both in numbers and strength.
[01:01:05] So this is common sense stuff.
[01:01:07] If you think the enemy is better than you, don't fight him head on.
[01:01:10] That's gorilla warfare.
[01:01:12] If you think the enemy is bigger and stronger than you, you don't fight him head on.
[01:01:15] All arts and trades, whatever are brought to perfection by continual practice.
[01:01:26] How much more should this maximum true in inconsiderable matters be observed in affairs of importance?
[01:01:36] And how much superior to all others is the art of war by which our liberties are preserved,
[01:01:42] are dignity is perpetuated and the provinces and the whole empire itself exists.
[01:01:51] You don't really like that.
[01:01:53] You're suspect.
[01:01:55] I think you like it enough for both of us.
[01:01:59] Okay.
[01:02:00] We'll take that.
[01:02:02] It's true though.
[01:02:04] Yeah, I actually can dig it.
[01:02:06] Yeah, I mean, let's face the facts here.
[01:02:08] If it wasn't for war, well, then you'd just be enslaved by someone.
[01:02:16] I mean, I'd love for it to not be that, for that to not be the case.
[01:02:20] But if it wasn't for war, you would just be enslaved by people.
[01:02:23] Yeah, someone else, that was someone that believed in war, would you be this slave of them?
[01:02:27] Yeah, that's I would work.
[01:02:28] Yeah, you're sorry.
[01:02:29] I'm sorry.
[01:02:30] That's the nature of the world.
[01:02:32] Yeah, no, you're actually right.
[01:02:35] Yeah.
[01:02:36] It's like, it's like the hope or wish that everyone was just perfect.
[01:02:42] Of course, that'd be great.
[01:02:43] Or actually in a way, would it be great though?
[01:02:46] You know how like sure.
[01:02:47] It'd be great if I got along everyone's saying goodbye on.
[01:02:49] I don't know, but isn't isn't like stress or imbalance or whatever.
[01:02:53] Isn't that the catalyst for any kind of progress of any kind?
[01:02:56] What if everyone was just happy and it's just all good.
[01:02:59] It's satisfied.
[01:03:00] Yeah, right.
[01:03:01] I don't know man.
[01:03:02] I think we'd be in the stone.
[01:03:03] I think it's bad.
[01:03:04] Yeah, we probably would be.
[01:03:05] But guess what, if we're in the Stone Age, and I see that you got a piece of whatever piece of meat or rock that I want, guess what?
[01:03:12] I know.
[01:03:13] I see that.
[01:03:13] I see that.
[01:03:14] But now you're talking reality.
[01:03:15] Yeah.
[01:03:15] Of course.
[01:03:16] So, but so I mean, I guess the question is not to call off on too much of a tangent, but the question is, would you want it to be all peaceful all the time?
[01:03:24] With no progress.
[01:03:25] Would you want that?
[01:03:26] Good theoretical question.
[01:03:29] Kind of know, right?
[01:03:30] I mean, because you're kind of thinking that you're kind of thinking, like doing graphic design.
[01:03:34] I don't know.
[01:03:35] I'm not confused.
[01:03:36] I wouldn't exist if it wasn't for war.
[01:03:37] Nope.
[01:03:38] It would not.
[01:03:39] There you go.
[01:03:40] Point taken.
[01:03:41] But even like, even like competition, right?
[01:03:44] You know how it's like, yeah, competition is good.
[01:03:46] Healthy competition is good.
[01:03:47] It's good for you.
[01:03:48] It makes you be, it doesn't feel like that.
[01:03:49] Even when you're in the moment, it's like, let's say you're just dominating.
[01:03:52] And whatever.
[01:03:53] I don't know.
[01:03:54] You play tennis.
[01:03:55] I don't know.
[01:03:56] And you're killing everyone.
[01:03:57] And you're number one.
[01:03:58] You're breaking world records.
[01:03:59] You're money.
[01:04:00] And then you kind of notice this new young hungry guy coming in.
[01:04:03] You start breaking your some of your records.
[01:04:05] You're like, you don't like that.
[01:04:07] That makes you kind of mad.
[01:04:08] You kind of wish that never happened.
[01:04:11] But at the same time, that usually is a catalyst for you to start working harder.
[01:04:15] You're preparing for that young.
[01:04:17] I'm all about it.
[01:04:18] Yeah.
[01:04:19] But you're kind of kind of, and you like the head to head, you know, like you like that.
[01:04:23] Yeah, like the competition.
[01:04:24] Yeah.
[01:04:25] You like directly, though.
[01:04:26] You know, like when you say, when I think anyway, when when they say healthy competition is good,
[01:04:31] it's the result of healthy competition is good.
[01:04:33] You get the best product, right?
[01:04:35] In the market or whatever.
[01:04:36] And that's the result.
[01:04:37] That's why it's good.
[01:04:38] That's why it's kind of empirically good, ultimately.
[01:04:40] I agree.
[01:04:41] Sure.
[01:04:41] It's not a perfect process.
[01:04:43] You know.
[01:04:44] You know, you're on the fence of my eye.
[01:04:46] No.
[01:04:47] But you, you like, like if I came up and you could tell, I was feeling good.
[01:04:51] That would make you, that would make you nervous.
[01:04:54] You'd be happy.
[01:04:55] You'd be like, you like that head to head to head to head to head.
[01:04:57] I felt you were feeling good about what?
[01:04:59] Come on.
[01:05:00] On the mat.
[01:05:01] On the mats of justice.
[01:05:02] Yeah.
[01:05:02] If you come up to me, you're all excited.
[01:05:04] Yeah.
[01:05:05] Or even give me the echo Charles Scowl.
[01:05:07] Yeah.
[01:05:08] What is, okay.
[01:05:09] You're open and more.
[01:05:10] You're right.
[01:05:11] Because I just played that through my mind.
[01:05:13] Yeah.
[01:05:13] When I see you like that, I'm like, oh, yeah.
[01:05:15] It's even more on.
[01:05:16] And so I'll even put it more accurately.
[01:05:18] More extreme more understandable as far as what I think you're like.
[01:05:22] So let's say we went enrolled and I tapped you out.
[01:05:24] Right.
[01:05:25] For the first time.
[01:05:26] Sure.
[01:05:31] You wouldn't like that specific thing.
[01:05:31] But when we roll again, that's when you'd be at your happiest right there.
[01:05:35] That's what I think.
[01:05:36] Like I think most of us.
[01:05:37] Yeah.
[01:05:38] I mean, you want more of a challenge.
[01:05:40] Yeah.
[01:05:41] Like all of that.
[01:05:42] It's really on now.
[01:05:43] That moment to you is a very pleasurable moment.
[01:05:46] It's what it seems like.
[01:05:47] For some people like, from, I don't know.
[01:05:49] I would even argue for like a lot of people like that.
[01:05:51] I mean, maybe that's a good example, maybe not.
[01:05:54] But that moment usually is a very stressful moment.
[01:05:57] Like dang, now I got to deal with this now.
[01:05:59] You know, and sure, it'll result in the way better stuff for sure.
[01:06:03] But the moment is less embraced.
[01:06:05] Yeah.
[01:06:06] You know what I think people should pay attention to too is the thing that bothers people again.
[01:06:14] Topically we've talked about before.
[01:06:15] The thing that bothers people is the anticipation of the situation.
[01:06:20] Right.
[01:06:21] But most people like you, like, we were talking about
[01:06:23] you making videos earlier.
[01:06:26] When you know, like there's a monster coming in your probably like,
[01:06:28] Oh, I got to do this video.
[01:06:30] That I would imagine hangs over your head more than when you actually are,
[01:06:33] All right, now you're doing the work and you're putting it together.
[01:06:35] And it's getting dialed.
[01:06:36] Yeah.
[01:06:37] That's how I feel about things.
[01:06:38] You know, I'll be like, there's something that I got to do.
[01:06:41] And I'm like, I'm like, oh, you know what?
[01:06:43] You do you attack that thing.
[01:06:44] Yeah.
[01:06:44] Jumping.
[01:06:45] Yeah.
[01:06:45] And now when you talk to me earlier about working out and like,
[01:06:49] Hey, do you ever just call it what I will do, which is major weakness is,
[01:06:55] I'll, I'll, I'll like, I'll like, wait.
[01:06:57] I'll, I'll, I'll pace.
[01:06:59] I've posted this on Twitter before like, yeah, I hemmed and hot.
[01:07:02] I, I, I, you know, read the weights.
[01:07:05] I vacuumed it and that's whatever I'm taking all kinds of reasons to not start.
[01:07:09] I'm procrastinating it.
[01:07:10] I'm going to do it.
[01:07:11] I'm going to make myself do it.
[01:07:13] But I'm just, I'm just like being such a baby.
[01:07:16] Yeah, right.
[01:07:19] Yeah, right.
[01:07:20] I do that 200%.
[01:07:21] Yeah.
[01:07:21] It's like, I'm not talking hours.
[01:07:22] Yeah.
[01:07:23] But it's there.
[01:07:24] But 20 minutes, you know, 20 minutes of like, you know what I better stretch out.
[01:07:27] Yeah.
[01:07:28] Yeah.
[01:07:28] Let me see.
[01:07:29] Yeah.
[01:07:29] Exactly.
[01:07:30] That's weak.
[01:07:31] Good.
[01:07:32] weak.
[01:07:33] Do it.
[01:07:34] Yeah.
[01:07:34] Just do it.
[01:07:35] That's the thing.
[01:07:36] That you know what, you know what, that's one thing.
[01:07:38] I'll tell you to little, this is a workout tip from Joccal Day.
[01:07:42] All right.
[01:07:43] You do, you put a stopwatch on stuff.
[01:07:45] Right.
[01:07:46] Like you, even when I'm doing something that's not really long, even when I'm doing something
[01:07:50] that's not really focused on the time.
[01:07:52] I at least put a stopwatch on it so that I just got to keep, you know, you just keep, it
[01:07:56] just keeps it on pace, man.
[01:07:57] Yeah.
[01:07:58] Because otherwise, that feeling that I just talked about will, will start finding itself in between
[01:08:03] sets.
[01:08:04] Yeah.
[01:08:05] Yeah.
[01:08:06] That's not good.
[01:08:07] Yeah.
[01:08:08] All of this weird thing, I've mentioned this workout that I started long time.
[01:08:12] Never really deviated that much for.
[01:08:14] It has rest between sets as part of the workout, the time designated time designated time.
[01:08:19] Designed time, yeah.
[01:08:20] It was always, I don't think, man, I can not think of a time where it ever worked out
[01:08:25] where the time between the sets was just like ambiguous or something.
[01:08:28] It was always a specific time.
[01:08:30] So that little procrastination thing would creep up between exercises or before my first
[01:08:36] set.
[01:08:37] You know what you were, I'm not feeling like.
[01:08:38] And the first set is usually the heaviest for me to.
[01:08:40] So I'm like, all right.
[01:08:41] All right.
[01:08:42] And that'll happen.
[01:08:43] You're right though.
[01:08:44] It's the watch on it.
[01:08:45] I have this one workout that I do where I do like it's el-sit pull ups and then talk pull
[01:08:52] ups and then dead hang pull ups and then kipping pull ups and then chin ups.
[01:08:55] And then chin ups.
[01:08:56] So it's like those five and you do as many as you can in each and then you then I do
[01:09:00] something else and then I come back and do again.
[01:09:01] I do like five rounds of that.
[01:09:03] So they're like burnout sets.
[01:09:04] Yep.
[01:09:05] Each one's a normal set.
[01:09:06] Okay.
[01:09:07] And like the first time I did that, I got that was cool.
[01:09:11] And so when the first time I did it, you know, it's kind of, let's just say motivated
[01:09:16] to do it.
[01:09:17] Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:18] Yeah.
[01:09:19] And this was years and years ago.
[01:09:20] And then the next time I did it, it took me a really long time.
[01:09:24] And I realized because I just was taking a long time between sets.
[01:09:27] Yeah.
[01:09:28] That's not the purpose of it.
[01:09:29] So now I always put a stopwatch on that thing.
[01:09:31] Yeah.
[01:09:32] Keep the clock ticking.
[01:09:33] Yeah.
[01:09:34] And that's it.
[01:09:35] And you feel it because you feel the clock ticking.
[01:09:37] Yeah.
[01:09:38] You know, you're like, oh my god.
[01:09:39] I guess that would apply to everything.
[01:09:40] Huh.
[01:09:41] Like, if you, you know, that's why like when I write, I do a thousand words.
[01:09:45] You know, why?
[01:09:46] Because it gets thousand words done in hours.
[01:09:47] Sometimes I'm, I'm wishing to see if I can get it in 50 minutes.
[01:09:51] Wait wait.
[01:09:52] So you will let say when you write, you boom, you set the clock.
[01:09:55] You're telling your watch.
[01:09:56] I don't set my watch.
[01:09:57] Yeah, but you have it.
[01:09:58] I look at it.
[01:09:59] I look at it all.
[01:10:00] It's, you know, eight, 48.
[01:10:01] Okay.
[01:10:02] 948.
[01:10:03] I'm going to be done.
[01:10:04] Yeah.
[01:10:05] I'm going to wrap this.
[01:10:06] I got to do this.
[01:10:07] Because that's even worse.
[01:10:09] You set their poster to buy an excreion or you click on that little, on that little, internet
[01:10:15] browser thing at the bottom.
[01:10:17] Then there you go.
[01:10:18] You're going on that slippery slope.
[01:10:20] Don't do it.
[01:10:21] Don't do it.
[01:10:22] Don't do it.
[01:10:23] Check.
[01:10:24] Talking about the general a little bit more.
[01:10:29] If therefore he finds his army composed of raw troops or if they have been long, long
[01:10:34] been unacustomed to fighting, he must carefully study the strength, the spirit, the
[01:10:38] manners of each particular legion and of each body of our Gilleseries cavalry and infantry.
[01:10:46] He must know if possible.
[01:10:48] This is good.
[01:10:49] He must know if possible the naming capacity of every count tribune, subaltern and
[01:10:53] soldier.
[01:10:55] He must assume the most respectable, authority and maintain it by severity.
[01:11:02] He must punish all military crimes with the greatest rigor of the laws.
[01:11:07] So there's a dichotomy there.
[01:11:09] He's saying you should know the name of every single person on your team.
[01:11:14] At the same time, if they get online, you maintain by severity.
[01:11:23] For troops that have never been an actioner of not for some time been used to such
[01:11:28] spectacles, been used to such spectacles are greatly shocked at the sight of the wounded
[01:11:33] and dying.
[01:11:34] The impressions of fear they receive disposed them rather to fly than defy.
[01:11:45] That's again to me is how to train people and get them used to what they're going to
[01:11:51] be facing in the real world.
[01:11:53] Always keep that in mind as a leader.
[01:11:55] And I was about to say, I'm always keep that in mind as a trainer.
[01:11:58] But as a leader, guess what you are, you're the trainer.
[01:12:04] Having explained the less considerable branches of the art of war, the order of military
[01:12:10] affairs naturally leads us to the general engagement.
[01:12:14] So now he's up to this point.
[01:12:16] He's only been talking about how to get ready for war.
[01:12:19] This is a conjecture full of uncertainty and fatal to kingdoms and nations for indecision
[01:12:25] in the decision of a pitched battle consists the fullness of victory.
[01:12:32] troops must never be engaged in a general action immediately after a long march when the
[01:12:37] men are fatigued and the horses tired.
[01:12:39] The strength required for action is spent in the toil of the march.
[01:12:43] What can a soldier do who charges went out of breath?
[01:12:49] Sure, everyone's going to hit me up.
[01:12:51] So you need more rest.
[01:12:56] And he goes on to a little, a little get after it right here.
[01:13:00] The sentiments of the troops should be determined before battle.
[01:13:04] It is necessary to know the sentiments of the soldiers on the day of the engagement.
[01:13:08] Their confidence or apprehensions are easily discovered by their looks, their words, their
[01:13:12] actions, and their motions.
[01:13:15] No great dependence is to be placed on the eagerness of young soldiers for action for fighting
[01:13:20] has something agreeable in the idea to those who are strangers to it.
[01:13:27] They're saying the young soldiers that have been in war that are all fired up the fight don't
[01:13:31] listen to them because there's some agreeable in the idea of fighting to be let haven't
[01:13:37] done it before.
[01:13:38] And then he says on the other hand, it would be wrong to hazard into an engagement if the
[01:13:42] old experience soldiers testify a disclination, a disinclination to fight.
[01:13:51] So if the old guys are like, hey, there's boss, not a good idea.
[01:13:54] Pay attention.
[01:13:56] A general, however, may encourage an animatist troops by proper exhortations and herangs,
[01:14:02] especially if by his account of the approaching action he can persuade them into the belief
[01:14:08] of an easy victory.
[01:14:11] With this view, he should lay before them the cowardice or unskillfulness of their enemies
[01:14:16] and remind them of any former advantages they may have gained over them.
[01:14:19] He should employ every argument capable of exciting rage, hatred, and indignation against
[01:14:25] the adversaries in the minds of his soldiers.
[01:14:28] Now this is something I disagree with.
[01:14:31] I disagree with this idea.
[01:14:32] I disagree with the idea of telling the troops that it's going to be an easy victory, of
[01:14:39] telling the troops that, hey, they're cowards.
[01:14:43] I don't agree with that.
[01:14:45] Because when you do that, there's a lot of things that can go bad.
[01:14:50] Number one, when you go against the enemy and you face them and they start doing
[01:14:55] good against you because they're more skilled than you expected.
[01:14:58] That's a problem.
[01:14:59] Yeah.
[01:15:00] Yeah, I can jam up your morale.
[01:15:02] Oh, that can jam up your morale really bad.
[01:15:04] So I don't recommend ever disrespecting the enemy.
[01:15:08] I recommend you give them, if not to mention, if you're this can be an easy victory.
[01:15:12] What's your mindset going into it?
[01:15:14] Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:15] Cruising.
[01:15:16] First of all, you're not training hard for it.
[01:15:17] You think you're going to win a easy it's called, yeah, don't do that.
[01:15:20] No, you respect the enemy.
[01:15:23] I think the point that he may have been trying to make is I don't be afraid of the enemy.
[01:15:26] I get that.
[01:15:27] Not for me afraid of, but respect them.
[01:15:30] Mm-hmm.
[01:15:31] Didn't affect the great say something like that in last time, like something about
[01:15:35] remind them of how lame they are or whatever.
[01:15:40] He did say something like that and actually it just, the thing that he was saying, wow,
[01:15:47] what was that he said?
[01:15:51] He was saying, no, what he was saying was only talk about the enemy with total score.
[01:15:57] Right.
[01:15:58] That's what he was saying.
[01:15:59] Only talk about the enemy with total score.
[01:16:00] And actually he was also saying, like, you shouldn't even hate the enemy, but don't
[01:16:03] let anyone know that you don't hate them this size.
[01:16:05] Which was kind of embarrassing.
[01:16:06] And he's saying the same thing like rage and hatred and indignation.
[01:16:11] That's how you want them to be thinking of the enemy.
[01:16:12] So they both agreed on that point.
[01:16:14] But I disagree on the point of tell your men that this is going to be an easy fight,
[01:16:19] because it's not going to be an easy fight.
[01:16:20] Yeah.
[01:16:21] Back to the book.
[01:16:24] It is natural for men in general to be affected with some sensations of fear at the
[01:16:29] beginning of an engagement.
[01:16:30] But there are without a doubt some of a more tomorrow's disposition who are disordered
[01:16:38] by the very site of the enemy to diminish these apprehensions before you venture on action,
[01:16:45] draw up your army frequently in order of battle in some safe situation so that your men
[01:16:50] may be accustomed to the site and appearance of the enemy.
[01:16:54] When opportunity offers, they should be sent to fall upon them and endeavor to put them
[01:16:58] to fight or kill some of their men.
[01:17:03] Thus they will become acquainted with their customs, arms and horses and the objects with
[01:17:08] which we are once familiarized are no longer capable of inspiring us with terror.
[01:17:16] It's amazing how good you get it.
[01:17:17] It's something like if you've seen it one time.
[01:17:21] Just think about any situation.
[01:17:23] Think if you scare someone which I enjoy scaring people.
[01:17:30] But if you scare someone and then they come back in and you try to do the same thing, they're
[01:17:34] not scared at all.
[01:17:35] It doesn't work.
[01:17:37] So that's what that's how you want to prepare your people.
[01:17:42] You get them used to those seeing what they're going to see.
[01:17:46] The generals are acutely aware that victory depends much on the nature of the field of battle.
[01:17:53] When you intend, therefore, to engage, endeavor to draw the chief advantage from your situation,
[01:17:59] the highest ground is reckoned the best.
[01:18:02] Always take the high ground.
[01:18:12] Talking about reserves, the method of having bodies of reserves in the rear of the enemy,
[01:18:17] composed of choice infantry and cavalry, commanded by the super-numerary, lieutenant generals,
[01:18:24] counts and tribunes is very judicious and of great consequence toward the gaining of a battle.
[01:18:31] Some should be posted in the rear of the wings and some near the center to be ready to fly
[01:18:35] immediately to the assistance of any part of the line which is hard pressed to prevent
[01:18:40] its being pierced.
[01:18:42] To supply the vacancies made therein during the action and thereby to keep up the courage
[01:18:48] of their fellow soldiers and check the impetuosity of the enemy.
[01:18:55] So as ever, reserves don't over extend yourself.
[01:19:01] The post of the commander in chief is generally on the right between the cavalry and the infantry
[01:19:07] from this place he can best direct the motions of the whole army and move elements with
[01:19:14] the greatest of ease wherever he finds necessary.
[01:19:16] It is also the most convenient spot to give his orders to both horse and foot and animate
[01:19:22] them equally by his presence.
[01:19:25] So position yourself in a good spot.
[01:19:34] An able general never loses a favorable opportunity of surprising the enemy either when
[01:19:40] tired on the march, divided in the passage of a river, embarrassed in a morassus, struggling
[01:19:46] with the declavities of mountains, when dispersed over the country they think themselves
[01:19:52] in security or are sleeping in their quarters.
[01:19:57] So just take advantage of your enemy whenever they let their guard down.
[01:20:02] In all these cases the adversaries are surprised and destroyed before they have time to put
[01:20:07] themselves on their guard.
[01:20:10] But if they are too cautious and you and give but if they are too cautious to give you
[01:20:19] an opportunity of surprising or incinerating them you are then obliged to engage openly
[01:20:25] in on equal terms.
[01:20:26] So whenever you get the chance you suck or punch them.
[01:20:31] Right?
[01:20:32] Sure.
[01:20:33] You know is that the is that am I encouraging you to grab and soccer punch people?
[01:20:39] No, but if you're going to fight take advantage of the situation.
[01:20:43] If you've already determined that the enemy you need to be fought you're going to do
[01:20:46] everything you can to.
[01:20:49] But isn't that?
[01:20:50] If you think I just started to rash of soccer punches?
[01:20:53] No, I feel like you misused the expression.
[01:20:56] That's what I think.
[01:20:57] Because soccer punch is more of a waging of war or certain level of war when someone's
[01:21:03] in the same thing.
[01:21:04] These are already at war.
[01:21:05] They're already at war.
[01:21:06] So now it's like it's kind of.
[01:21:08] So soccer punches the kind hey we're just going to go invade this country.
[01:21:11] They have no idea that we're you know they don't know one of their citizens said something
[01:21:16] bad about our president or something like that.
[01:21:18] But if you guys are in war and they're sleeping or something like that oh no man that's
[01:21:23] good.
[01:21:24] I agree.
[01:21:25] I agree no I actually agree with you very much.
[01:21:28] Very strongly I think you're correct.
[01:21:29] Yeah.
[01:21:30] In fact I don't think you should soccer punch anyone.
[01:21:32] Yes I agree you shouldn't soccer punch someone.
[01:21:36] But if you are at war with someone, yes then you try to get them at their least prepared
[01:21:43] situation.
[01:21:44] Yes agree.
[01:21:45] 1000%.
[01:21:46] All right this is important.
[01:21:49] The flight of an enemy should not be prevented but facilitated.
[01:21:55] Generals unskilled in war think a victory incomplete unless the enemy are so straightened
[01:22:01] in their ground or so entirely surrounded by numbers as today have no possibility of escape.
[01:22:10] But in such situation where no hope remains fear itself will arm an enemy and despair
[01:22:17] inspires courage as powerful.
[01:22:20] I think about that fear itself will arm the enemy if you surround them completely.
[01:22:26] When men find themselves, oh sorry, when men find they must inevitably perish they willingly
[01:22:33] resolve to die with their comrades and with their arms in their hands.
[01:22:41] The maximum that a golden bridge should be made for a flying enemy has much been commended
[01:22:48] for when they have free room to escape they think of nothing but how to save themselves
[01:22:53] by flights and the confusion.
[01:22:55] Now you might think that you might think by that statement he say hey like you build
[01:22:59] a golden bridge for them to get away.
[01:23:01] You might think that that's sort of a merciful thing to do but check out this line
[01:23:07] and the confusion becoming general great numbers are cut to pieces.
[01:23:14] The pursuers can be in no danger when the vanquished have thrown away their arms for
[01:23:18] greater haste.
[01:23:19] So in here guys are dropping their swords they see an escape they drop their swords and they
[01:23:22] run for it but you got them you're waiting their form.
[01:23:25] In this case the greater number of the flying enemy the greater the slaughter.
[01:23:31] Those are of no signification where troops once thrown into consternation are equally
[01:23:37] terrified at the sight of the enemy as their weapons.
[01:23:43] So that's good advice.
[01:23:46] This is something as well.
[01:23:50] You know it's not the same thing but man when you when you're dealing with another
[01:23:56] human being and let's say let's say you and I are talking about something and I know
[01:24:01] I'm right and I know you're wrong but you kind of planted yourself into it.
[01:24:04] You kind of painted yourself into a corner I'll give you a little out.
[01:24:08] I don't want to do that to you.
[01:24:11] I don't want to do that to be hard work with.
[01:24:13] No.
[01:24:14] It'll give you a little out.
[01:24:15] Oh yeah it's probably the way it used to be but you know what hey it's a little
[01:24:17] something.
[01:24:18] We go like yeah yeah you know definitely I've done it before.
[01:24:21] I call that school I'm not worked.
[01:24:23] What do you think of this?
[01:24:26] It's good.
[01:24:31] It's a nice thing to do but it feels very smart.
[01:24:35] The way it's very smart.
[01:24:37] It's very smart.
[01:24:38] Do you give people a little out?
[01:24:40] I have to do that with I have to do that with my kids you know.
[01:24:44] They're a little out because I'll paint themselves in a corner because their kids you know.
[01:24:48] That's what they do.
[01:24:49] They just ask what they do.
[01:24:50] Yeah.
[01:24:51] Yeah.
[01:24:52] It's a one-year embarrass someone because that's kind of embarrassing.
[01:24:55] Especially when you get into some argument where it turns into a meance you kind of
[01:24:58] think that you realize you're wrong and you're like oh man I have to basically give them
[01:25:02] a wow I got yeah get me give that out so we're kind of we're both winners.
[01:25:06] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
[01:25:16] Back to the book in the first place your men must not imagine that you retire
[01:25:21] to decline in action but believe you retreat an artist to draw the enemy in to a more
[01:25:29] advantageous position for you where you may more easily defeat them in case they follow
[01:25:35] you.
[01:25:36] For troops you perceive their general disperse of success are prone to flight.
[01:25:42] So what that saying is and I should have given this introduction before is that if you
[01:25:47] feel like you have to retreat you don't say hey we're we're we're getting crushed here
[01:25:52] and we're going to retreat what we say is hey we're going to bathe them we're going to move
[01:25:56] back we're going to draw them in so then guys go okay I get it if you're just like
[01:26:01] hey we're getting our ass is kicked and we need to get out of here you're going to lose
[01:26:05] people going to run away but if you're like hey we're doing this maneuver we're going
[01:26:08] to fade back a little bit we're going to set them up and you go oh cool I'm going
[01:26:11] to get an opportunity for payback.
[01:26:13] Yeah yeah so that's a good point yeah very good point.
[01:26:16] It seems like their mindset would still be in the fight in that case.
[01:26:19] For sure.
[01:26:20] And then versus.
[01:26:21] Oh we're getting our out of here exactly you keep them in the fight exactly.
[01:26:27] Now once people once the enemy is fleeing and you chase them you got to be careful
[01:26:34] back to the book a rationing considerate pursuit exposes an army to the greatest danger
[01:26:39] possible that of falling into ambush ambushes and the hands of the troops enemy troops
[01:26:46] ready for their reception.
[01:26:49] For as in the term temerity of an army is increased and their caution lessened by the
[01:26:55] pursuit of a flying enemy this is most favorable opportunity for such snares so when you
[01:27:02] get somebody running after you that's when you can catch them.
[01:27:06] The greater the security the greater the danger troops went unprepared at their meals
[01:27:13] fatigue after march when their horses are feeding and insured when they believe themselves
[01:27:18] most security most secure are generally most liable to a surprise.
[01:27:24] All risks of this sort are to be avoided carefully and all opportunities taken of distressing
[01:27:29] the enemy by such methods.
[01:27:34] So that mindset that people get like you just said when they're running away is one
[01:27:40] thing but also when they think they just want they get the mindset of like oh we don't
[01:27:43] need security anymore anymore right now.
[01:27:46] We don't need it we're good.
[01:27:50] There's that one little line.
[01:27:54] The greater the security the greater the danger that that line right there doesn't
[01:27:57] make any sense.
[01:27:59] The greater the security the greater the danger what he's saying is when the the greater
[01:28:02] the security is the greater the danger of being susceptible to letting your guard down.
[01:28:09] Yeah like if you like the MMA situation they got the guy dead.
[01:28:15] You're not sure fine right we talked about it but yeah you got him deeds days and they're
[01:28:19] like well I'm gonna go in for the finish all crazy not like as cautious as maybe they
[01:28:24] should be kind of that situation.
[01:28:25] Yeah for sure he's talking about the greater the security so the better you feel.
[01:28:29] Right this you're saying.
[01:28:30] But I keep losing that line the greater the security the greater the danger the greater
[01:28:36] the security the greater the danger that's what it is.
[01:28:38] So when you're feeling secure watch it watch yourself resources in case of defeat.
[01:28:46] If while one part of your army is victorious the other should be defeated you are by
[01:28:50] no means to despair since even in this extremity the constancy and resolution of a general
[01:28:57] may recover a complete victory.
[01:29:01] So just because you take a little loss doesn't mean you're gonna lose completely yet
[01:29:04] notwithstanding an entire defeat all possible remedies must be attempted since many generals
[01:29:09] have been fortunate enough to repair such a loss.
[01:29:12] So you can always come back.
[01:29:15] And army after defeat has sometimes rallied returned on the enemy dispersed him by pursuing
[01:29:20] in order and destroyed him without difficulty.
[01:29:25] And more can men be in a more dangerous situation than when in the midst of joy after victory
[01:29:32] their exaltation is suddenly converted into terror.
[01:29:41] So same thing your joy is because you want and all of a sudden your the tables turn.
[01:29:49] Whatever be the event the remains of the army must be immediately assembled reanimated
[01:29:54] by suitable exhortations and furnished with fresh supplies of arms.
[01:29:58] That's what you do.
[01:30:00] When you get a good victory you're like all right reload that's what we're doing right
[01:30:03] now.
[01:30:07] And in this last section of the book he kind of just breaks down and sums up the rest of
[01:30:16] the book that we just read.
[01:30:18] So these are all pretty familiar most of them because we got covered most of them.
[01:30:26] It is the nature of war that what is beneficial to you is detrimental to the enemy and
[01:30:31] what is of service to him always hurts you.
[01:30:36] That seems like common sense.
[01:30:39] The more troops the more your troops have been accustomed to camp duties on frontier
[01:30:46] stations and the more carefully they have been disciplined the less danger they will
[01:30:51] be exposed to in the field.
[01:30:56] Train them hard men must be sufficiently tried before they are let against the enemy.
[01:31:01] Train them hard.
[01:31:02] It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror than my general actions.
[01:31:09] From the latter instance fortune has often a greater share than valor.
[01:31:16] I like the idea of overcoming the enemy just by terror.
[01:31:21] Just I wish there was like a full chapter about that.
[01:31:25] That's legit.
[01:31:28] Those designs are best which the enemy are entirely ignorant of till the moment of execution.
[01:31:35] The enemy in war is often more to be depended on than courage.
[01:31:45] To debauch the enemy soldiers and encourage them when sincere in surrendering themselves
[01:31:52] is of a special service for an adversary is more hurt by desertion than my slaughter.
[01:31:58] So if you can get the enemy to come over to your side that's even worse to the enemy.
[01:32:04] And when you're just killing them.
[01:32:05] Because you think about when you're getting your friends killed you have some kind of
[01:32:08] vengeance.
[01:32:09] But if they just take your friends and they're like all in the back room having to have
[01:32:14] them to blast a wine.
[01:32:15] You know what?
[01:32:16] I don't think that sounds better than the deal I got.
[01:32:22] It is better to have several bodies of reserves than to extend yourself too much to the
[01:32:27] front.
[01:32:28] There you go.
[01:32:30] A general is not easily overcome who can form a true judgment of his own and the enemy forces.
[01:32:37] We've been hearing that once in Sunsu.
[01:32:40] Art of war.
[01:32:41] Valor is superior to numbers.
[01:32:45] The nature of ground is often of more consequence than courage.
[01:32:49] These guys talking about terrain.
[01:32:51] That's what he's talking about.
[01:32:52] So everyone that's an military lesson this right now.
[01:32:54] terrain terrain terrain.
[01:32:55] Learn to read the terrain.
[01:32:59] This is a good one.
[01:33:00] Few men are born brave.
[01:33:03] Many become so through care and force of discipline.
[01:33:09] Great dichotomy there.
[01:33:11] Care for your people and through force of discipline is what makes people brave.
[01:33:20] The army is strengthened by labor and weakened by idleness.
[01:33:30] Don't sit around.
[01:33:33] Don't sit around.
[01:33:34] Keep moving.
[01:33:36] Troops are not to be led to battle unless confident of success.
[01:33:41] Evoltean surprised throwing enemy into consternation but common incidents have no effect.
[01:33:50] Learn new moves.
[01:33:54] That's some advice I need to take.
[01:33:55] I always do the same moves.
[01:33:57] Not good.
[01:33:59] He who rashly pursues a flying enemy with troops in disorder seems inclined to resign that victory
[01:34:07] which he had before obtained.
[01:34:10] So if you go pursuing the enemy when your troops aren't organized you're basically trying
[01:34:15] to give away your victory.
[01:34:17] So be careful when you pursue.
[01:34:21] An army unsupplied with grain and other necessary provisions will be vanquished without
[01:34:25] striking a blow.
[01:34:27] I need to wind you finds.
[01:34:29] I looked around and I've been looking for like a Roman soldier and they've found some
[01:34:33] letters and stuff but these guys must have been hungry.
[01:34:36] Talk about the time I'm hungry.
[01:34:42] On finding the enemy has notice of your designs you must immediately alter your plan
[01:34:46] of operations.
[01:34:48] Check.
[01:34:49] Consult with many on proper measures to be taken but communicate the plans you intend
[01:34:55] to put an execution to few and only those of the most assured fidelity or rather trust
[01:35:01] no one but yourself.
[01:35:05] Because interesting consult many people get some feedback from everyone.
[01:35:10] Next, punishment and fear thereof are necessary to keep soldiers in order in quarters.
[01:35:18] But in the field they are more influenced by hope and rewards.
[01:35:26] Oh, that caught me for you.
[01:35:29] Good officers never engage in general actions unless induced by opportunity or obliged
[01:35:36] by necessity.
[01:35:39] To distress the enemy more by famine than the sword is the mark of consummate skill.
[01:35:48] And this is actually the last one.
[01:35:49] Here dispositions for action must be carefully concealed from the enemy.
[01:35:53] Unless they should counteract them and defeat your plans by proper experience.
[01:36:01] So again I didn't cover all the maxims and the reason I didn't is because some of the
[01:36:05] maxims that he talks about are legitimately ancient or tactical warfare.
[01:36:11] But it's worth getting the books so you can read those and understand them.
[01:36:15] And he kind of ends this book with a little note to the emperor of Rome at the time.
[01:36:23] And this is how he wraps it up.
[01:36:25] How glorious it is therefore for your majesty with all these qualifications to unite the
[01:36:31] science of war and the art of conquest and to convince the world that by your conduct and
[01:36:38] courage you are equally capable of performing the duties of the soldier and the general.
[01:36:49] So he wraps up the book with that last dichotomy.
[01:36:59] And I think that's one of the really one of the most important qualities for a leader to
[01:37:07] have.
[01:37:08] And one of the most important qualities to be able to balance and that is to be able to maintain
[01:37:16] and lead from the highest position and at the same time never forget where you came from.
[01:37:24] You've heard that expression.
[01:37:25] Don't forget where you came from that's what he's talking about.
[01:37:30] And I think for every leader what that means is recognize that you still have more to learn.
[01:37:39] But you can still grow, you can still try and get better and obviously that's what we're
[01:37:47] doing here is trying to learn and trying to keep learning.
[01:37:55] And I think that wraps this up.
[01:37:59] Obviously we make this podcast so that we can learn and other people can learn if they want
[01:38:05] to join in and if you learn anything and you want to give this podcast some support.
[01:38:13] There's some great ways to do it.
[01:38:16] And the goal to when you support the podcast is that you also support yourself.
[01:38:23] That's the goal mutually supporting situation is what we're going for.
[01:38:27] So first off we got our company up in Maine, up in New England, or in USA, informing
[01:38:35] to Maine, 100% American-made products.
[01:38:41] It's a Gigi to company first and foremost, right?
[01:38:43] That's the foundation.
[01:38:44] These and rashguards, interestingly, guise one of the hardest things in the world to make
[01:38:51] from scratch.
[01:38:54] And we make them here in America.
[01:38:56] A lot of people think they're the best.
[01:39:00] That's actually what I think.
[01:39:01] Yeah.
[01:39:02] So it depends on what you mean by the best.
[01:39:06] So if you think that the ones that fit the most appropriately for Gigi to, then yeah, they're
[01:39:15] going to use your Gigi to Gigi for Gigi to, then the best.
[01:39:18] They're the best.
[01:39:19] Conqueror.
[01:39:20] If you want various different weeds, various different options that happen to me, Maine
[01:39:26] to America, and various perfect blends for washing, drying, and time microbial stuff.
[01:39:35] You know, when you see, do you remember the first time you saw Dragon Weave, like with
[01:39:41] your own eyes?
[01:39:42] Were you impressed?
[01:39:44] I was.
[01:39:46] Like it's legitimately, it's legitimately impressive.
[01:39:50] I actually, this is one of the dumbest things I've ever thought of in my life.
[01:39:54] All right, lay it on me.
[01:39:55] Okay, first, saw Dragon Weave.
[01:39:57] I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legit, because you know, sometimes I
[01:40:02] got to wear a suit, because I'm going to work with a couple of you.
[01:40:04] I thought to myself, it would be cool to get a legitimate suit made out of this.
[01:40:08] Dragon Weave, Dragon Weave, Dragon Weave, yeah.
[01:40:11] I can see that.
[01:40:12] It took me about 20 minutes before I realized I was an idiot.
[01:40:15] But it's that cool looking.
[01:40:17] Yeah.
[01:40:18] So, and it's that practical.
[01:40:22] That's the thing.
[01:40:23] Yeah.
[01:40:24] You can get Giz, Rashcards, OriginMain.com.
[01:40:28] What else?
[01:40:29] Joggers.
[01:40:30] Well, it's okay.
[01:40:31] So, you wanted the suit, sorry about you said it.
[01:40:34] So, let's talk about it.
[01:40:36] At least a little bit.
[01:40:37] You said the suit.
[01:40:38] The suit, dude.
[01:40:39] You know, okay, you know, hey, Dragon Weave, suit.
[01:40:43] Good, cool.
[01:40:44] But, so they had, I've talked about this before, where my favorite shorts are Dragon Weave
[01:40:49] shorts.
[01:40:50] They were something.
[01:40:51] They don't make them.
[01:40:52] Sorry.
[01:40:53] Oh, well.
[01:40:54] So, I was talking to Pete about him and I was like, hey, you know, like, you should
[01:40:58] make the Jaggynly's.
[01:41:00] And I forgot why, but, you know, not now.
[01:41:03] There's other shorts, which are actually could prove more dope.
[01:41:10] You see the buttons, like, you saw the buttons, right?
[01:41:12] Like, for the shorts.
[01:41:13] They're these buttons.
[01:41:14] Right there, dope.
[01:41:15] Anyway.
[01:41:16] So, yeah, there's some joggerats, some shirts, and whatnot, some regular apparel, more athletic
[01:41:20] wear, but super comfortable.
[01:41:23] I'll tell you that.
[01:41:24] As the self slash whatever pro claimed, kind of sort of comfort, I can say, come on.
[01:41:30] So, we've come to the most comfortable stuff you're ever going to put on.
[01:41:34] If you find anything more comfortable, let me know.
[01:41:36] We'll see, compare apples to apples.
[01:41:38] But yeah, some good stuff there.
[01:41:40] Also some supplements.
[01:41:42] And you know, speaking of the sub.
[01:41:44] So, you know, you know who Dr. Rhonda Patrick is.
[01:41:47] Yes.
[01:41:48] She's been on Joe Rogan a couple of times.
[01:41:49] Yeah.
[01:41:50] Probably more not.
[01:41:50] Anyways, she just tweeted out this thing, talking about curcumin.
[01:41:58] And like, no kidding, double on.
[01:42:00] I'm triple whatever tests UCLA.
[01:42:05] Curcumin is awesome for you.
[01:42:08] And.
[01:42:09] But do you remember like what?
[01:42:11] Yes.
[01:42:12] You know, this is this is the thing.
[01:42:13] It blew off.
[01:42:14] The article actually blew off.
[01:42:17] Wouldn't even blew off.
[01:42:18] It was like, yeah, curcumin keeps down information.
[01:42:20] Like that was no big deal.
[01:42:22] Right.
[01:42:23] Right.
[01:42:24] Actually, that's a huge deal.
[01:42:25] That's one of the reasons why it's in Joe and Warfare.
[01:42:26] But then they did like a test.
[01:42:29] And it improved memory and like cognitive reaction 28%.
[01:42:36] This is in a lab.
[01:42:37] And so, and then they referred to people in India that people in India who have a high level
[01:42:44] of curcumin in their diets.
[01:42:47] That's why Indian food looks yell.
[01:42:48] Well, is because of that.
[01:42:51] There's one not just like direct, but they're saying that's really interesting fact, right?
[01:42:57] Yeah.
[01:42:58] So anyways, that's in there.
[01:42:59] It's in joint warfare.
[01:43:00] So there's more than just joint warfare.
[01:43:03] Yeah.
[01:43:04] The super krill, which is real oil.
[01:43:05] As we all know by now, krill oil is pretty much the best source of omega.
[01:43:11] Better than fish oil.
[01:43:12] Yes.
[01:43:13] And we all know fish oil is good.
[01:43:15] So oil is even better super krill oil.
[01:43:18] Even better than regular krill oil.
[01:43:19] You know what?
[01:43:20] The big difference between super krill oil and krill oil.
[01:43:23] I do that.
[01:43:24] Yeah, it's super.
[01:43:25] No, but there's in some actual technical beneficial, super stuff.
[01:43:32] And it's like zen, it's something.
[01:43:34] But it's an antioxidant.
[01:43:35] Absolutely.
[01:43:36] It's not an antioxidant.
[01:43:37] It's an antioxidant.
[01:43:38] It's something.
[01:43:39] Sorry.
[01:43:40] I'm saying it wrong.
[01:43:41] But it's an antioxidant, which is a big deal.
[01:43:42] You know what rust is rust?
[01:43:44] Yeah, the oxidation.
[01:43:45] Yes.
[01:43:46] All that is oxidation and metal.
[01:43:48] So when you get some people, I did, well, I knew this for a long time.
[01:43:51] But before I knew it, this is what I was going to say.
[01:43:53] This is how my brain was as far as antioxidants go.
[01:43:56] My mom was like, hey, antioxidants.
[01:43:57] I'm like, wait, oxidant, oxidant, oxygen.
[01:44:01] Oxygen is good.
[01:44:02] Why is it antioxidant kind of thing?
[01:44:04] I'm saying, no, it's not antioxidant.
[01:44:06] Oxygen, antioxidant, meaning it fights oxidation, which is rust of your body.
[01:44:12] So your body technically is kind of rusting.
[01:44:16] You know, antioxidants keeps it from rusting.
[01:44:18] So now that you, what do you get?
[01:44:19] You get a loyal one here?
[01:44:21] When you hear antioxidants, that's what you're hearing.
[01:44:23] It's going to keep your body from rusting straight up.
[01:44:25] So, real oil.
[01:44:26] Omega-3's better uptake than fish oil.
[01:44:29] And we need to make it many things.
[01:44:31] Just know that you need them.
[01:44:32] In this case, for your joints.
[01:44:34] In other cases, for your eyeballs, your brain, your organs, all this stuff.
[01:44:40] But know that just know that it has many uses plus antioxidants, boom, super-cruel oil.
[01:44:45] That's what makes it super.
[01:44:47] Then joint warfare, as we mentioned.
[01:44:49] Yes, that's for your joint procurement.
[01:44:51] Not just procurement.
[01:44:52] No.
[01:44:53] Glucos mean conjoining.
[01:44:54] These are things for scary age.
[01:44:56] Man, I'm telling you, if you have bad joints, boom, joint warfare.
[01:44:59] Boom.
[01:45:00] Get some discipline too.
[01:45:02] But yeah, by the way.
[01:45:04] And so now, what we have as it turns out, according to Dr.
[01:45:07] Rhonda Patrick, is that we have, so that all the things to each other.
[01:45:12] Yeah.
[01:45:13] So, joint warfare, krill oil is the joints.
[01:45:15] But joint warfare also has cognitive enhancement, which as does the discipline.
[01:45:21] So, there you go.
[01:45:23] Discipline is like, what do you call it?
[01:45:25] A powdered drink.
[01:45:26] That's what it is, right?
[01:45:27] Yeah, you know.
[01:45:28] That's, I mean, I'll mix it up.
[01:45:29] You put a little in your water bottle.
[01:45:31] And then it gives you a little bit of natural muscle.
[01:45:34] Yep.
[01:45:35] So, you see that mental, mental, and very much.
[01:45:38] Dave Berkson, me a text, he said, quote, best quote from the last podcast, Dave
[01:45:43] Berkson, like a crackhead or something like that.
[01:45:47] Sorry, Dave, no offense.
[01:45:48] Yeah.
[01:45:49] I know you're just like the discipline.
[01:45:51] Yeah.
[01:45:52] Amen.
[01:45:53] Did you see someone posted a picture of like a guy with like cocaine, powder, all over
[01:45:57] his face.
[01:45:58] Yeah, the Dave should help.
[01:45:59] Situation.
[01:46:00] Yeah, that's a good thing.
[01:46:01] Dave Berkson, yeah.
[01:46:02] Maybe more than, at least, you've got nowhere to that discipline.
[01:46:05] Yeah, well, well, so milk.
[01:46:07] Okay, so that's a little bit of shifting gears.
[01:46:09] Scenario.
[01:46:10] In regards to supplements, milk.
[01:46:13] Okay.
[01:46:14] I'm gonna say the word protein, but I said this is from a city again, because to me,
[01:46:17] it's appropriate.
[01:46:18] I'm gonna say the word protein powder, but I'm not gonna say, hey, milk is a protein,
[01:46:21] but I'm not gonna say that.
[01:46:23] It's not appropriate, because it's different.
[01:46:26] This is how it's different.
[01:46:28] It's milk.
[01:46:29] I just had a guy hit me up and he said, I don't drink protein powder.
[01:46:35] But it sounds like this is just dessert.
[01:46:37] Yeah.
[01:46:38] And I hate to say it.
[01:46:40] It's kind of true.
[01:46:41] It kind of tastes like that too.
[01:46:43] But dessert kind of has this kind of guilty kind of feel to it.
[01:46:49] This is a guilt-free dessert.
[01:46:51] Here's what I did though.
[01:46:52] I was pushing though.
[01:46:53] I know.
[01:46:54] I was gonna kind of let you know, but I was like, hey, you know, just let me just
[01:46:58] have it be funny for me.
[01:47:00] So I'm thinking literally thinking of milk while I'm shopping.
[01:47:04] Yeah.
[01:47:05] So when I shop, you know, you wouldn't, I don't know how much you shop, but.
[01:47:08] Zero.
[01:47:09] Okay.
[01:47:10] So I go in.
[01:47:11] Next question.
[01:47:12] I only go to, right?
[01:47:13] I get red leaf lettuce.
[01:47:14] I eat a lot of red leaf lettuce for whatever.
[01:47:16] And I get milk.
[01:47:19] But this time, I'm thinking of the milk.
[01:47:21] I don't know why.
[01:47:22] It was just in my head.
[01:47:23] I wasn't gonna go drink some milk at that time.
[01:47:25] It was just in my head for whatever.
[01:47:26] And my eyes shifted to chocolate milk.
[01:47:28] So I'm like, hey, what if I mix the chocolate milk with the milk?
[01:47:32] I know, right?
[01:47:33] It might be too much.
[01:47:34] Did you do it?
[01:47:35] No, I didn't do it.
[01:47:36] Yeah, you don't need to.
[01:47:37] Then again, why would I knock it for a try?
[01:47:40] Because what if I discover something, seems same.
[01:47:44] I didn't do it yet.
[01:47:45] I'll report back.
[01:47:46] But nonetheless, it is like a dessert, but it's one of those beneficial desserts.
[01:47:51] Yeah, that's like a dark chocolate.
[01:47:52] Like, you know, you know, consider dark chocolate.
[01:47:55] Right.
[01:47:56] I mean, it's a certain percentage of something where it's like good for you.
[01:47:59] Yeah.
[01:48:00] Got a drink of milk.
[01:48:01] Like that.
[01:48:02] It's like a big milkshake.
[01:48:03] But it's egg in there.
[01:48:04] You really want to get milk.
[01:48:05] Well, we'll have some milk for sure at the immersion camp.
[01:48:10] Which is, by the way, all this 26th, that's what it is.
[01:48:14] Last year, we didn't have milk.
[01:48:15] And then, milk wasn't even invented yet.
[01:48:17] It was like straight up didn't exist.
[01:48:19] It didn't exist.
[01:48:20] It was like then all the sudden you cracked an atom open.
[01:48:24] And they had to add milk to the periodic table.
[01:48:27] That just happened.
[01:48:28] Last year, I had to drink.
[01:48:29] I just drank in the chocolate milk because they had it at the camp.
[01:48:32] All right.
[01:48:33] Yeah.
[01:48:34] Like the old school cafeteria chocolate milk.
[01:48:36] Just, it's just, it's just, it's just horrible.
[01:48:38] You don't like it?
[01:48:39] No.
[01:48:40] I mean, I think I'm going to think of the experience because that's what it had.
[01:48:42] It's not good.
[01:48:43] It's not good.
[01:48:44] So, yeah, immersion camp.
[01:48:46] August 26th, in September 2nd, that's the last day about those two sessions in there.
[01:48:52] I would say, you know, I can't speak for anyone else.
[01:48:56] I would say, yeah, good of both.
[01:48:57] That's good, but you know, good of one, good of two, whatever.
[01:49:00] For those that are wondering, and I, this isn't confirmed yet, but we pretty pretty much
[01:49:05] had the talk.
[01:49:07] Pete, me, and be little.
[01:49:10] And the conversation is looking like morning, ghee afternoon, no ghee evening, which
[01:49:21] ever choice.
[01:49:22] Yeah.
[01:49:23] That's like a dream, isn't it?
[01:49:24] I think so too.
[01:49:25] And I don't have any complaints from the last one.
[01:49:30] Yeah.
[01:49:31] Literally, I have no complaints.
[01:49:33] But I do remember thinking, if there was some no ghee mixed in here, this would really,
[01:49:39] this would make me kind of not really want to leave.
[01:49:41] The ever.
[01:49:42] Yeah.
[01:49:43] This is worth pointing out.
[01:49:44] This is the kind of thing that I, you ever think about like people that are OCD.
[01:49:51] Yes.
[01:49:52] I think about that all the time.
[01:49:53] Right.
[01:49:54] And I'm both of, so sometimes I have a little bit of that.
[01:49:58] But one of them is like, I want things to be squared away.
[01:50:02] Right.
[01:50:03] And so when I was going to the camp, I was kind of like, how is this whole laundry thing
[01:50:07] that I work?
[01:50:08] Like what's going to happen?
[01:50:09] This was before.
[01:50:10] Yeah.
[01:50:11] Okay.
[01:50:12] Well, the thing is, just to let everyone know, if you come to camp, they do laundry.
[01:50:14] There's like a laundry service.
[01:50:15] They pick it up and they wash our clothes and then they bring back in all your clothes,
[01:50:20] nice and clean.
[01:50:21] And that's a huge deal.
[01:50:22] So you think you could basically get away with two geese?
[01:50:25] Yes.
[01:50:26] Two geese.
[01:50:27] Well, maybe three.
[01:50:29] All right.
[01:50:30] Yeah.
[01:50:31] I would say that way.
[01:50:32] I only had two.
[01:50:33] Probably three geese.
[01:50:34] I didn't bring any geese.
[01:50:35] I got an origin one.
[01:50:36] Oh, yeah.
[01:50:37] I was going to get there.
[01:50:38] Yeah.
[01:50:39] I'm saying to rotate them through properly.
[01:50:40] But they're pretty fast on its turnaround.
[01:50:42] Anyways, that's a deal.
[01:50:43] But that's a, that's a, that's kind of a big deal.
[01:50:45] The laundry is a case.
[01:50:46] Because this is a difference between, hey, there's a laundry service.
[01:50:49] Um, well, across camp to laundry mat and go handle your business.
[01:50:52] Well, I actually, the camp is at a different same lake, echo lake.
[01:50:56] But it's a different lake.
[01:50:57] But I don't know what the exact laundry service, I think it's going to be the same
[01:51:00] exact thing though, because the service didn't come from camp last time.
[01:51:03] It's somebody that does laundry for geese.
[01:51:05] Yeah.
[01:51:06] Makes it.
[01:51:07] There should be people in the world that just do ge laundry.
[01:51:08] Just ge laundry.
[01:51:09] Just.
[01:51:10] Yeah.
[01:51:11] They come in grab it though.
[01:51:12] They're not going to do it like room service.
[01:51:14] Yeah.
[01:51:15] Really, it's huge to do.
[01:51:16] I think it's a very convenient, great, nice.
[01:51:17] Yeah, emergency camp, August 23rd, August 26th through September 2nd, 2 sessions.
[01:51:24] I'm going to be there.
[01:51:25] Jocco is going to be there rolling.
[01:51:27] Yeah.
[01:51:28] Rolling to fulfill your curiosity of how it is to roll with Jocco.
[01:51:33] Um, I'm not going to say it'll be a good time rolling with Jocco.
[01:51:39] I'm not going to say that much down.
[01:51:40] My, you might get left down as far as pleasurable experiences go.
[01:51:44] No, no, no, no.
[01:51:45] Yeah, it might be everyone thinks all he's got to be so unbelievable.
[01:51:48] No, it's like I'm not that good at gejitsu.
[01:51:50] Yeah, I wasn't really thinking that.
[01:51:51] I was thinking more, um, oh, yeah, it'll be fun and pleasurable.
[01:51:57] Meanwhile, it'll be like 90% painful and then like 5% in mercy.
[01:52:03] And, you know, there's other negative emotions.
[01:52:06] But yeah, you can, you know, whatever.
[01:52:08] If you wonder about that kind of stuff, I don't know, maybe you don't.
[01:52:11] But yeah, that's in origin.
[01:52:13] Also, we have a store actually.
[01:52:17] Choco has a store and it's called Choco store.
[01:52:21] Who made that name up?
[01:52:23] I did.
[01:52:24] Keep it in it simple.
[01:52:25] Anyway, this is where you can get the rash guards that we make.
[01:52:29] Get after it.
[01:52:30] We'll trooper rash guards.
[01:52:32] War your kid rash guards too.
[01:52:33] By the way, if we're youth or your kids getting into gejitsu boom, and for surfing, and
[01:52:39] for whatever, running, cycling, all that stuff.
[01:52:42] And, uh, what other rash guards are there?
[01:52:45] I'm just, to make sure.
[01:52:47] I'm just, to make sure.
[01:52:48] Yeah, I'm just gonna get some rash guards.
[01:52:50] That's what I'm gonna make.
[01:52:51] Stand by the get.
[01:52:52] Sure.
[01:52:53] I was gonna make a good rash guard, but then I thought, hey, what's the message
[01:52:57] of good?
[01:52:58] Is it a stand by to get some too close to get after it?
[01:53:02] No, okay.
[01:53:03] Because stand by the get some is when you're standing by the get some.
[01:53:08] Getting after it is when you're actually getting after it.
[01:53:11] So when you're standing by or you're getting after it's two different things completely,
[01:53:15] back to the good rash guard, it's important.
[01:53:16] I think as far as the layers go, okay, good is like when something quantum quote
[01:53:21] bad happens.
[01:53:22] Mm-hmm.
[01:53:23] It's always something good to come from.
[01:53:25] So what you said, it's a direct quote.
[01:53:27] So you can't make and put on a rash guard that's based on something bad happening
[01:53:33] as far as losing goes or something like that, right?
[01:53:36] Okay.
[01:53:37] I guess you could technically.
[01:53:38] If it looked dope.
[01:53:39] I don't know.
[01:53:40] Do you still have any way back to the T-shirts?
[01:53:42] There's some coins on there, right?
[01:53:44] Yeah, just put that deaf core on the T-shirt.
[01:53:47] Deaf.
[01:53:48] Yeah.
[01:53:49] Good idea.
[01:53:50] I think you're right about that.
[01:53:51] Oh, hats on there as well.
[01:53:54] Two kinds of hats as a random.
[01:53:55] Actually three technically.
[01:53:56] Three types of head gear.
[01:53:58] Trucker hats.
[01:53:59] Flex fit hats.
[01:54:01] Beanie's just on time for summer.
[01:54:04] Actually, beanie's been out for a while.
[01:54:06] Beanie's was a set of random months.
[01:54:07] Yeah, right on mom.
[01:54:08] Get yourself too much credit, but speaking of summer and winter hoodies.
[01:54:13] You get hoodies on there too.
[01:54:15] Legit hoodies.
[01:54:16] Non-hoi and hoodies.
[01:54:18] Or you're going to make, you're going to make a Hawaiian hoodie apparently.
[01:54:21] Yeah, I think technically there's no such thing as Hawaiian hoodie, but I will have a lighter
[01:54:25] weight hoodie for when you go to Hawaii and it turns night time and the wind breeze
[01:54:32] kind of blows and you're like, hang out, shadowy, long sleeve shirt or you know.
[01:54:36] And it'll look kind of dope.
[01:54:37] That's why.
[01:54:38] The whole approach in my opinion is the women's stuff on there too.
[01:54:42] You know, for the lady troopers, some tank tops and V-neck type t-shirts made specifically
[01:54:48] for the ladies.
[01:54:51] Solid, this is a good one.
[01:54:53] Go ahead and also, otherwise it's a support.
[01:54:54] Another way to support.
[01:54:56] Subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already.
[01:54:58] On iTunes and Stitchering Google Player.
[01:55:00] Wherever you listen to podcasts, whatever platform you choose to use also YouTube.
[01:55:09] Yeah, you should subscribe to YouTube.
[01:55:12] The reason is so you can see echoes legit videos.
[01:55:16] For instance, you just really released one.
[01:55:18] Thank God.
[01:55:19] Yes, echo had made a video for Warpath and he put Christmas music.
[01:55:24] Which we all love.
[01:55:25] Which in these doing Christmas time when we were all.
[01:55:28] There's everything in the time.
[01:55:29] And the thing is, the video is so graphically intense and I could tell and you had actually
[01:55:36] told me that it took days, days to put together three seconds worth of film.
[01:55:46] And so when you showed it to me, I was super pumped.
[01:55:49] And then I heard the music.
[01:55:51] I was super unpomped.
[01:55:53] Unpomped.
[01:55:54] Yeah.
[01:55:55] That was unpomped.
[01:55:56] And anyways, he's readown the Warpath video.
[01:55:59] Now it's good music behind it, not Christmas music.
[01:56:03] We'll just say revised.
[01:56:04] It's revised.
[01:56:05] You know, we can still revisit the Christmas music.
[01:56:08] Did you call off the old one?
[01:56:09] No, no, I left it man, that's for us.
[01:56:10] You know, folks who like Christmas.
[01:56:12] Oh, the Grinch over here.
[01:56:14] Yeah, I know.
[01:56:16] But yeah, it's good.
[01:56:17] YouTube, yeah, subscribe to the YouTube and leave a review on the iTunes thing.
[01:56:22] If you're in the mood, that's my opinion.
[01:56:24] There you go.
[01:56:25] It's a good one.
[01:56:26] Good way to support too.
[01:56:27] Also.
[01:56:28] If you are looking to improve and increase your supply of fitness gear, I just got
[01:56:34] a few things for my bicep, perhaps.
[01:56:38] You know, when you kind of choose your mark on a different type of fitness, you know,
[01:56:43] I don't know, you stick with the same thing.
[01:56:44] I get it.
[01:56:45] No, but different things.
[01:56:46] Yeah, yeah, yeah, you get fired up.
[01:56:48] Anyway, I don't want to go into that.
[01:56:49] But I got some new stuff.
[01:56:51] Anyway, where you get it is, in my opinion, go to on it.
[01:56:53] So on it.com slash chocolate.
[01:56:55] You can get some good stuff on there, including, but not
[01:56:58] limited to kettlebells, maces.
[01:57:01] I'm going to get better ropes.
[01:57:02] I just read some really good stuff about better ropes.
[01:57:05] Yeah, better ropes.
[01:57:06] I've done them, but not with any kind of regularity.
[01:57:08] Yeah, yeah, I want to do a battle rope program.
[01:57:12] Yeah, I don't go in too much, but it's like, you know, like, if you're, it's like
[01:57:18] for mechons, you know, and you can do a boy body boom, boom, boom, yeah.
[01:57:23] It's like a burns a lot of calories, get to a muscular conditioning and stuff like that.
[01:57:27] But I really good.
[01:57:28] I was like, after you read it, it's like, you want to do better ropes from now on.
[01:57:32] Anyway, good on it.com slash chocolate.
[01:57:34] I got the mace from chocolate today.
[01:57:39] I was fired up.
[01:57:40] It's heavier than you saw.
[01:57:41] Yeah, so, and I knew it was going to be heavy.
[01:57:42] That's the thing.
[01:57:43] Like, I know, because that's only a 20 pounder.
[01:57:45] Yeah.
[01:57:46] And lucky.
[01:57:47] If you're, you know, that's one of those things.
[01:57:48] I think, you know, when we talk about kettlebells and people will say, like, what
[01:57:52] size kettlebell do you start off with?
[01:57:55] It's hard to narrow that down.
[01:57:57] That thing is heavy.
[01:57:58] There's not too many people that are just getting all over that 20 pounder.
[01:58:01] Yeah, don't even mean club.
[01:58:02] This is like too heavy.
[01:58:03] I've never done a mace workout, either way.
[01:58:07] This is too heavy for me to do like a workout.
[01:58:10] Yeah.
[01:58:11] I'm like, even, like, it's so, it looks like a big, what he called, not a bowling pin, but
[01:58:14] you know, the juggling pins, you know, like the people in the jaw.
[01:58:17] So it looks like that.
[01:58:18] But a waist 20 pounds.
[01:58:19] It feels like a waist like 50 pounds.
[01:58:20] Yeah, this is literally heavy.
[01:58:21] It feels like that.
[01:58:22] It's all big.
[01:58:23] Anyway.
[01:58:24] Yeah.
[01:58:25] I'm going to work it in and I'm going to report back.
[01:58:27] And I feel that suit.
[01:58:28] I'm going to be a lot stronger than you.
[01:58:30] Son.
[01:58:31] Yeah, I like it.
[01:58:32] That's good.
[01:58:33] Speaking of that, if maybe you're thinking, oh, instead of working out, I'm going
[01:58:37] to take a break, you can get the psychological warfare album that has tracks.
[01:58:42] It's on iTunes, Google Play, MP3, wherever you can MP3s.
[01:58:47] Just a little bit of guidance on how to overcome situations where maybe you're not going
[01:58:53] to get after you and you know you should.
[01:58:54] Yeah.
[01:58:55] So there you go.
[01:58:58] Working on psychological warfare, too, at this time.
[01:59:01] So that'll be coming in the future.
[01:59:03] All your excuses are lies.
[01:59:04] Yeah.
[01:59:05] That can be the title psychological warfare, too.
[01:59:06] All your excuses are lies.
[01:59:08] Yeah.
[01:59:09] See that?
[01:59:10] Look, we just kind of came up.
[01:59:11] Yeah, that's good.
[01:59:12] I like how you do that.
[01:59:13] I'd call it like a spot.
[01:59:14] Like a spot.
[01:59:15] I'm going to go psychological spot.
[01:59:17] Yeah.
[01:59:18] That's what it is.
[01:59:19] Because you might call that, though, because not everyone thinks of, when you say
[01:59:21] spot, you're thinking of 1994 weightlifting bodybuilding.
[01:59:25] Sure.
[01:59:26] Oh, no.
[01:59:27] Bit of powerlifting.
[01:59:28] Yeah, I guess you can't really spot on a power clean, like Olympic-climbing.
[01:59:31] Yeah.
[01:59:32] Nonetheless, it is a spot nonetheless.
[01:59:34] We got this award analogy you want to use.
[01:59:35] I think the spot is the best because you don't need a spot necessarily.
[01:59:41] Most of the time, you don't need it.
[01:59:42] Most of the time.
[01:59:43] Cool.
[01:59:44] But if you got a spot out there and you need the spot, both there it is.
[01:59:46] And he's a spot in here and he's going to bring you through.
[01:59:48] You're not going to let the bar bear you.
[01:59:51] You want to stand?
[01:59:52] Fair enough.
[01:59:53] Also, chocolate some tea.
[01:59:54] It's called chocolate tea.
[01:59:57] Interesting lean off.
[01:59:59] Dry tea, which is tea bags and in a can, which have been popping every day, by the way.
[02:00:05] It's so good.
[02:00:06] I'm not going to say it's an anti-najja medication.
[02:00:09] I'm not going to say that.
[02:00:10] But as it turns out, it's kind of an anti-najja medication.
[02:00:16] Super refreshing that they can't buy the way.
[02:00:17] Also anti-weteness, because once you drink chocolate tea, you can that lift 8,000 pounds
[02:00:23] automatically.
[02:00:24] Hey, it's available.
[02:00:25] Think Canada too.
[02:00:26] On Amazon and Canada, that's new.
[02:00:28] So check out Canadian folks up there hanging out with Jody Minick somewhere.
[02:00:32] There.
[02:00:33] Ottawa.
[02:00:34] Then you can get it there too.
[02:00:38] Also got some books.
[02:00:40] Way the Warrior Kid and Mark's Mission.
[02:00:43] Those are for children.
[02:00:46] But I think everyone that reads him gets something out of them.
[02:00:50] You just have to check them out.
[02:00:51] They're right.
[02:00:52] That video you did with Brian Rose.
[02:00:55] Yeah.
[02:00:56] The one that everyone saw my brother's watching the video.
[02:01:00] I don't know why he's all like surprised.
[02:01:03] He's impressed.
[02:01:04] Okay, I get it.
[02:01:05] But he's all surprised and impressed.
[02:01:06] You know the difference.
[02:01:07] So he's watching the video.
[02:01:09] You know how you basically the part where you're explaining where the work here, part
[02:01:13] two.
[02:01:14] Mark's Mission.
[02:01:15] The logical bully, you know, did this thing and now Mark wants to fight and we can fight
[02:01:19] now.
[02:01:20] No, it's due to the same kind of one.
[02:01:21] So I'm called Jake's like, you know, comes in and he's all, hey, cool.
[02:01:26] You can fight them.
[02:01:27] So I was like, okay, all right, I'm going to take you know, getting that's whatever.
[02:01:30] Okay, you can fight them.
[02:01:31] But first, you got to do recon or Intel, right?
[02:01:33] Intel, gather whatever.
[02:01:34] See what up.
[02:01:35] And so he does and he finds out all this stuff, you know, and through like finding
[02:01:40] the stuff, whatever he gains like a little bit understanding and whatever.
[02:01:43] So instead of fighting them, maybe you should help them kind of thing.
[02:01:47] So it's like this little curve bought.
[02:01:48] It's like man, it's like kind of taking the high ground when you don't expect
[02:01:51] to.
[02:01:52] He does kind of like that.
[02:01:53] He's all impressed.
[02:01:54] He had an already pressed with it.
[02:01:56] Not bad.
[02:01:57] I'm not a meat that thing.
[02:01:58] Still read it to my little girl.
[02:01:59] That's Jack.
[02:02:00] It's kind of the ethos, right?
[02:02:01] The way of the worry kid ethos, you just read it.
[02:02:03] You just keep read when you're done reading it, you read it.
[02:02:05] You get started all over.
[02:02:06] Yeah.
[02:02:07] Yeah.
[02:02:08] She likes it.
[02:02:09] She liked the paper, Michelle Pumpkin.
[02:02:10] Yeah.
[02:02:11] Situation.
[02:02:12] That was actually pretty fun.
[02:02:14] Yeah.
[02:02:15] It was good.
[02:02:16] And also, I'm trying to figure it out.
[02:02:18] Oh yeah, big toe.
[02:02:19] Also the field manual.
[02:02:21] Discipline equals freedom, field manual, best book ever written.
[02:02:25] Best book physically look at my opinion back on black.
[02:02:28] What do you think of that front cover for photograph?
[02:02:31] Do you like that?
[02:02:32] Yeah, you think.
[02:02:33] Very iconic.
[02:02:34] Footer.
[02:02:35] Yeah.
[02:02:36] Yeah.
[02:02:37] That's a good one.
[02:02:38] It's like Woody call, like a manual for.
[02:02:41] If you make it a manual for life in general, I think you'd be on the good path right there.
[02:02:46] I agree.
[02:02:47] I agree.
[02:02:49] If you need a manual for some leadership, you got an extreme ownership.
[02:02:54] That's the book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
[02:02:57] And it's about calm, I leadership, and how you can apply it.
[02:03:00] The lessons that we learn on the battlefield to everything you do in your business and
[02:03:05] in your life and your relationships with people.
[02:03:09] And also coming pretty soon actually is the fall of all of that book that I also wrote
[02:03:16] with Dave, the dichotomy of leadership.
[02:03:19] It is, you hear us talk about dichotomy all the time.
[02:03:23] It's actually the last chapter of extreme ownership.
[02:03:26] This is the trickiest thing about leadership is trying to balance this dichotomy.
[02:03:30] So we talk about it and do deep dive and get granular on how to balance that dichotomy
[02:03:36] of leadership in that book, which is titled, the dichotomy of leadership.
[02:03:42] You can preorder it right now.
[02:03:43] It comes out September 25th.
[02:03:46] If you don't want to get a copy when it comes out, then don't order it now.
[02:03:51] And you won't get one.
[02:03:52] Because it's going to sell out and the publishers are slacking as usual.
[02:03:56] No, but like, well, wait, but there's probably only a preta few of these because
[02:04:00] you're connected.
[02:04:01] Yeah.
[02:04:02] The projected numbers are off always.
[02:04:05] You want to get the, you want to get the first edition.
[02:04:08] That's my opinion.
[02:04:09] So do that.
[02:04:10] And for all, for leadership training on site, beyond the books, beyond the podcast,
[02:04:17] I have Eshelon front.
[02:04:18] It's our leadership consulting company.
[02:04:23] We solve problems through leadership.
[02:04:26] Also we have the master, which is a leadership conference.
[02:04:31] There's only one more.
[02:04:32] This year, it's in San Francisco, Mr. 006.
[02:04:35] It's October 17th and 18th.
[02:04:37] You have to register for that at extremalnership.com.
[02:04:40] Every master we've done has sold out this one will sell out to and also for current military
[02:04:46] law enforcement, board of patrol, firefighters, paramedics, first responders.
[02:04:49] We've got the role calls 001, September 21st in Dallas, Texas.
[02:04:55] It's a focus one day leadership training seminar for people that are in uniform handling
[02:05:00] stressful situations and you can also register for that at extremalnership.com.
[02:05:04] And until we are live at the master in San Francisco or at the role call in Texas or at the
[02:05:14] immersion camp in Maine.
[02:05:17] Until then, if you want to cruise kind of hard with us, we are on the interwebs on Twitter,
[02:05:24] on Instagram and yes on that baseball table.
[02:05:29] Go to that atcliotrals and I am at Jockel Willink and thanks to all the people in uniform
[02:05:34] out there, military police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, border patrol,
[02:05:39] all first responders really.
[02:05:42] We won't be able to do what we do without you doing what you do.
[02:05:47] So thank you for protecting us and taking care of us and also thanks to your families who
[02:05:53] support you while you support us and to everyone else.
[02:05:59] Thanks for listening and remember what Vigadia said that it isn't just size or numbers or
[02:06:11] even courage itself that will ensure victory instead.
[02:06:17] It is exact observance of discipline.
[02:06:23] That is what it takes.
[02:06:26] That is what you need.
[02:06:27] So go out there and get after it.
[02:06:31] And until next time, this is echo and jockel out.
