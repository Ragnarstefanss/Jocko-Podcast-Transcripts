00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.92
This is Jocko podcast number 358 with Dave Burke and me,

2
00:00:03.92 --> 00:00:04.80
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:04.80 --> 00:00:05.76
Good evening, Dave.

4
00:00:05.76 --> 00:00:06.24
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:12.72
It is with deep personal concern that I officially inform

6
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:17.20
you that your son, first Lieutenant Leon F. Ellis, Jr.

7
00:00:18.72 --> 00:00:24.64
is reported missing in North Vietnam on 7 November 1967.

8
00:00:24.64 --> 00:00:31.68
He was a pilot on an F-4C aircraft on an operational mission.

9
00:00:32.96 --> 00:00:35.92
His aircraft was last seen to roll in on target.

10
00:00:36.88 --> 00:00:40.08
Shortly thereafter, a large fireball was seen,

11
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.72
where his aircraft previously was located.

12
00:00:44.08 --> 00:00:46.96
The fireball descended to the ground and impacted.

13
00:00:48.48 --> 00:00:52.32
The crew was not seen to bail out, but however,

14
00:00:52.32 --> 00:00:56.80
voice contact was established with your son on ground.

15
00:00:58.16 --> 00:01:00.48
Rescue operations are in progress.

16
00:01:01.68 --> 00:01:04.56
Lieutenant Ellis may have been captured.

17
00:01:06.24 --> 00:01:11.44
For his welfare, it is recommended that in reply to questions from other

18
00:01:11.44 --> 00:01:19.12
than your immediate family, you give only his name, grade, serial number, and date of birth.

19
00:01:19.12 --> 00:01:25.36
If this is the information he must provide if captured, please be assured when new

20
00:01:25.36 --> 00:01:29.12
information is received, it will be furnished to you immediately.

21
00:01:29.12 --> 00:01:36.72
A representative from Dobbins Air Force Base will contact you within 48 hours to assist

22
00:01:36.72 --> 00:01:38.40
in any way possible.

23
00:01:39.60 --> 00:01:44.88
If you have any questions you may call my personal representative,

24
00:01:44.88 --> 00:01:53.36
please accept my sympathy during this period of anxiety.

25
00:01:56.48 --> 00:02:03.20
Brigadier General George E. McCord, Military Personnel Center, Headquarters, United States Air Force.

26
00:02:03.20 --> 00:02:16.64
And that was the telegram received by Leon and Moline Ellis, parents of First Lieutenant Leon Ellis Jr.

27
00:02:18.80 --> 00:02:24.24
Probably one of the most terrifying things a parent could ever hear about their child.

28
00:02:24.24 --> 00:02:35.44
But the good news is Leon Ellis Jr. or Lee Ellis did survive being shot down.

29
00:02:35.44 --> 00:02:37.28
The bad news is he was captured.

30
00:02:38.56 --> 00:02:46.96
He was captured by the North Vietnamese and ended up spending five and a half years as a prisoner of war.

31
00:02:49.52 --> 00:02:53.12
But the good news is he did survive that.

32
00:02:53.12 --> 00:02:59.84
He went on to become a colonel in the Air Force and after that a speaker, a leadership consultant,

33
00:02:59.84 --> 00:03:00.56
and an author.

34
00:03:01.68 --> 00:03:11.68
He's written three books, Leading with Honor, another book called Engage with Honor, and a fourth coming book called Captured by Love.

35
00:03:11.68 --> 00:03:23.68
And it is a distinct privilege and an honor to have Lee Ellis with us here tonight to discuss his experiences and his lessons learned.

36
00:03:24.24 --> 00:03:26.72
Sir, thank you for joining us.

37
00:03:27.20 --> 00:03:28.000
Thank you, Jaco.

38
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.04
It's great to be with you.

39
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:35.36
I really enjoyed your book, your in life, Babin's book, leadership book, certificate.

40
00:03:37.20 --> 00:03:38.32
I can tell you the name of it.

41
00:03:38.32 --> 00:03:40.08
I've written a bunch of them, but it's all good.

42
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:44.88
But it was so good and I quoted it in several places in my book.

43
00:03:44.88 --> 00:03:49.04
So thank you for what you've done and are doing and it's a pleasure to be with you.

44
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:49.68
I'm excited.

45
00:03:50.24 --> 00:03:51.92
Yeah, I appreciate it for sure.

46
00:03:51.92 --> 00:04:02.16
And I mean, reading your books and having had a couple other POWs from Vietnam on this podcast.

47
00:04:02.16 --> 00:04:06.16
We had William Reeder, who was a helicopter pilot, was shot down.

48
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:20.16
He was shot down in South Vietnam, so he made the treacherous journey, months long journey through the jungle, staying in the jungle camps, which were, you know, by his account, the absolute horror.

49
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:22.72
And then, of course, we've had Charlie Plum on as well.

50
00:04:22.72 --> 00:04:24.72
And I know you know him.

51
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:28.16
So honor to have you here share your experiences.

52
00:04:28.16 --> 00:04:35.20
The perspective that you all bring to leadership and to life is just unbelievable.

53
00:04:35.20 --> 00:04:37.20
And it's something very powerful.

54
00:04:37.20 --> 00:04:49.20
I know as I read through what you all experienced, it's impossible not to try and take some lessons from that and improve the way I live as a human being.

55
00:04:49.20 --> 00:04:59.20
But with that, let's, before we jump into your time in Vietnam, let's start off in the beginning and how you grew up.

56
00:04:59.20 --> 00:05:01.20
So you were born in Georgia, right?

57
00:05:01.20 --> 00:05:03.20
Yes.

58
00:05:03.20 --> 00:05:11.20
I was born down in South Georgia, but when I was about two years old, my parents moved back to North Georgia because my grandmother had cancer.

59
00:05:11.20 --> 00:05:15.20
And we wanted to live near my mother's parents on the farm.

60
00:05:15.20 --> 00:05:23.20
And we lived in a four-bedroom house there on the farm, not a four-bedroom.

61
00:05:23.20 --> 00:05:25.20
Two bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen.

62
00:05:25.20 --> 00:05:27.20
That was it.

63
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:33.20
Back in, that was back in the 40s, my grandmother died, and then we moved in with my grandfather on that farm.

64
00:05:33.20 --> 00:05:39.20
So I grew up in the real days of farming.

65
00:05:39.20 --> 00:05:43.20
We went, by the way, we went barefooted from May until October.

66
00:05:43.20 --> 00:05:45.20
That was a thing we were proud of.

67
00:05:45.20 --> 00:05:47.20
We wanted to get those shoes off and go barefooted.

68
00:05:47.20 --> 00:05:53.20
Didn't wear a shirt much in the summertime and worked on the farm.

69
00:05:53.20 --> 00:05:57.20
Looking back, it was good that we had that responsibility.

70
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:03.20
My dad was not a farmer, but he learned to do some and work some.

71
00:06:03.20 --> 00:06:05.20
But my brother and I worked a lot there on the farm.

72
00:06:05.20 --> 00:06:13.20
My mother was a wonderful cook, and we had this huge garden, and we would grow an acre of garden stuff.

73
00:06:13.20 --> 00:06:19.20
So my mother would can a hundred quarts of beans every summer.

74
00:06:19.20 --> 00:06:23.20
And corn and peas and butter beans and all this stuff.

75
00:06:23.20 --> 00:06:29.20
Well, my brother and I did a lot of that work, and we would sit on the front porch in the swing,

76
00:06:29.20 --> 00:06:35.20
shelling butter beans or string and beans at night, listen to the Atlanta crackers,

77
00:06:35.20 --> 00:06:39.20
which was like a double-A baseball team before it became the Atlanta Braves.

78
00:06:39.20 --> 00:06:41.20
And that was life, you know.

79
00:06:41.20 --> 00:06:43.20
It was a good life and hard work.

80
00:06:43.20 --> 00:06:48.20
My brother milked a cow because my dad went to work in town.

81
00:06:48.20 --> 00:06:50.20
My brother would milk the cow in the morning and evening.

82
00:06:50.20 --> 00:06:53.20
That was good because I didn't have the same grip he did.

83
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:55.20
He was bigger than me and older.

84
00:06:55.20 --> 00:07:00.20
But I fed the hogs, fed the chickens, chopped the wood and brought in the coals every day.

85
00:07:00.20 --> 00:07:04.20
So, you know, this was the good thing was we learned about responsibility.

86
00:07:04.20 --> 00:07:06.20
We learned about being in the cold.

87
00:07:06.20 --> 00:07:10.20
We drove cars that sometimes the batteries were dead and you had to push them off.

88
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:12.20
They were all straight shifts.

89
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:17.20
So it was an era when we just, as young kids on the farm, we had a lot of responsibility.

90
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:25.20
But out there on that farm, during the Korean War, so which was 1951 to 53 or 54 timeframe,

91
00:07:25.20 --> 00:07:31.20
I was born in 43, so I was like eight, nine, ten years old.

92
00:07:31.20 --> 00:07:40.20
And I'd be out there on the farm working and I'd keep looking up because overhead with these huge formations of airplanes

93
00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:45.20
going off to war or going off to prepare people or drop, you know, paratroopers or whatever.

94
00:07:45.20 --> 00:07:47.20
And I'd look up at those airplanes.

95
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:48.20
Oh, wow.

96
00:07:48.20 --> 00:07:54.20
And all of that because when I was five, my parents took me to Athens, Georgia, which is 10 miles away,

97
00:07:54.20 --> 00:07:57.20
what the University of Georgia Bulldogs are, by the way.

98
00:07:57.20 --> 00:08:04.20
And in the park, the Veterans Park in Athens, Georgia, there was a World War II fighter plane.

99
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:10.20
And I climbed up on that wing and it was like at age five or six, I said, this is me.

100
00:08:10.20 --> 00:08:13.20
This is what I'm going to do.

101
00:08:13.20 --> 00:08:17.20
Well, now, I was also big into sports.

102
00:08:17.20 --> 00:08:22.20
My brother, my mother's brother had played football at the University of Georgia in 1928, 29.

103
00:08:22.20 --> 00:08:30.20
He became a doctor and his two sons played on scholarship at the University of Georgia in 50, 51, 52.

104
00:08:30.20 --> 00:08:35.20
So we would go down and watch the University of Georgia football practice over on Ag Hill there.

105
00:08:35.20 --> 00:08:41.20
So I got this in my mind and I wanted to be a quarterback at the University of Georgia.

106
00:08:41.20 --> 00:08:49.20
So I was a quarterback in high school and I was above average, but I wasn't the fastest guy on the team.

107
00:08:49.20 --> 00:08:55.20
In my senior year in high school, I only weighed 155 and they did not recruit me, which I didn't expect them to.

108
00:08:55.20 --> 00:09:01.20
So I went on to the University of Georgia when I finished high school and got in Air Force ROTC.

109
00:09:01.20 --> 00:09:04.20
And then I knew that was what I wanted to do.

110
00:09:04.20 --> 00:09:06.20
So what year is that that you go to college?

111
00:09:06.20 --> 00:09:09.20
I graduated high school in 1961.

112
00:09:09.20 --> 00:09:15.20
I went to college then and graduated in four years in 1965.

113
00:09:15.20 --> 00:09:24.20
Now, I was probably the worst student ever to graduate in four years because I had never really learned to study.

114
00:09:24.20 --> 00:09:30.20
I was kind of ADD and focused on whatever and I had to work to pay my college tuition and all that.

115
00:09:30.20 --> 00:09:36.20
I didn't have any money, so I worked and lived at home after my first semester there.

116
00:09:36.20 --> 00:09:40.20
I lived on campus just because I saved up money and wanted to do it.

117
00:09:40.20 --> 00:09:52.20
But in ROTC, I graduated as a distinguished graduate and went to flight school with the Academy Class A class of flight school.

118
00:09:52.20 --> 00:09:54.20
Was it was it hard to get into flight school?

119
00:09:54.20 --> 00:09:57.20
Not for me.

120
00:09:57.20 --> 00:10:04.20
I passed the exam and the written exams and I got my pilot's license my senior year in college.

121
00:10:04.20 --> 00:10:12.20
The Air Force had a flight indoctrination program where they kind of screened you out and I sailed through that and went right to flight school.

122
00:10:12.20 --> 00:10:22.20
I had always been driving. I started driving cars when I was 11, tractors when I was 12, and I could drive them by myself.

123
00:10:22.20 --> 00:10:26.20
I mean, they would let me go with responsibility to go drive them.

124
00:10:26.20 --> 00:10:31.20
I chauffeured for my grandfather when I was 12 and 13.

125
00:10:31.20 --> 00:10:40.20
I'd always been very confident about operating machinery and taking risks and being able to go right to the edge but not go over it.

126
00:10:40.20 --> 00:10:45.20
And so it just was a natural place to be.

127
00:10:45.20 --> 00:10:53.20
And when they told me that I passed the physical to be a pilot after my sophomore year, I was just thrilled.

128
00:10:53.20 --> 00:10:55.20
And I went over and changed my major.

129
00:10:55.20 --> 00:11:03.20
I was in pre-med and because my uncle had been a doctor and I wasn't going to get into medical school with my grades because I didn't study.

130
00:11:03.20 --> 00:11:09.20
I went over and changed my major to history and sailed right on through in four years and off to flight school.

131
00:11:09.20 --> 00:11:15.20
And flight school for me, I had a check every month.

132
00:11:15.20 --> 00:11:17.20
I bought myself a new car.

133
00:11:17.20 --> 00:11:19.20
What kind of car was it?

134
00:11:19.20 --> 00:11:23.20
Well, I was going to get either a school to get a GTO.

135
00:11:23.20 --> 00:11:29.20
They'd only come out with GTOs in 64 and this was summer of 1965.

136
00:11:29.20 --> 00:11:38.20
The problem was the GTO was bucket seats and I wanted a bent seat because back then I wanted my honey to be sitting like real close.

137
00:11:38.20 --> 00:11:41.20
And I said, I'm going to buy one of those stupid GTOs.

138
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:42.20
I love GTO.

139
00:11:42.20 --> 00:11:51.20
So I bought the Cutlass Supreme which is exactly like the GTO except a little bit smaller engine and had a bent seat.

140
00:11:51.20 --> 00:11:54.20
And I bought wire wheels on it to be cool.

141
00:11:54.20 --> 00:12:01.20
And my roommate bought a, his dad was a Ford dealer and he got a Mustang.

142
00:12:01.20 --> 00:12:04.20
So my roommate in flight school.

143
00:12:04.20 --> 00:12:10.20
So we were cool and the Beldost State College was right down there in Beldost, 11 miles away.

144
00:12:10.20 --> 00:12:13.20
We could just roll in there.

145
00:12:13.20 --> 00:12:18.20
We'd go to the freshman dorm and say, well, who's in there?

146
00:12:18.20 --> 00:12:24.20
And they had to sign out. We'd say, well, Janie and so and so will bring them down here and let us meet them.

147
00:12:24.20 --> 00:12:25.20
And they would.

148
00:12:25.20 --> 00:12:26.20
We liked them.

149
00:12:26.20 --> 00:12:28.20
We'd take them to the, let's go to the clubs.

150
00:12:28.20 --> 00:12:33.20
So I did not study very hard in UPT.

151
00:12:33.20 --> 00:12:35.20
And to me, UPT, I had a check.

152
00:12:35.20 --> 00:12:36.20
I had a car.

153
00:12:36.20 --> 00:12:43.20
There's girls nearby and I was living the life that I wanted to live in college but also doing flight school.

154
00:12:43.20 --> 00:12:44.20
Wait, what's UPT?

155
00:12:44.20 --> 00:12:45.20
Undergraduate pilot training.

156
00:12:45.20 --> 00:12:46.20
Okay.

157
00:12:46.20 --> 00:12:51.20
So is that before you go to, before you go, before you graduate from college?

158
00:12:51.20 --> 00:12:53.20
No, this is right after I graduated.

159
00:12:53.20 --> 00:12:55.20
Okay. So you graduate, you get commissioned.

160
00:12:55.20 --> 00:13:00.20
Three days later, I was in flight school in Beldost, Georgia at Moody Air Force.

161
00:13:00.20 --> 00:13:02.20
And this is 1965, right?

162
00:13:02.20 --> 00:13:03.20
Yes.

163
00:13:03.20 --> 00:13:04.20
What are you hearing about Vietnam?

164
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:05.20
How much is that on the radar right now?

165
00:13:05.20 --> 00:13:08.20
It's starting to jump, jump up and you, there's some debates.

166
00:13:08.20 --> 00:13:09.20
You see them.

167
00:13:09.20 --> 00:13:14.20
If you watch TV, there'll be some debates on there and Secretary Russ could be on there.

168
00:13:14.20 --> 00:13:16.20
They'll be talking about it.

169
00:13:16.20 --> 00:13:30.20
And we'd see a lot of Army helicopters would come through and pass refuel and there in Moody and going, you know, this was when the Army, Airborne, an Army, whatever the helicopter groups were called, really got going.

170
00:13:30.20 --> 00:13:31.20
Air cab.

171
00:13:31.20 --> 00:13:32.20
Air cab got going.

172
00:13:32.20 --> 00:13:33.20
That's right.

173
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:34.20
And they would come through.

174
00:13:34.20 --> 00:13:40.20
But in flight school, we didn't have any instructor pilots that had already been on a tour.

175
00:13:40.20 --> 00:13:50.20
And then as I was in a T-38, which was the second stage, the advanced flights, part of flight school, there was a major came in, a single guy who was a major.

176
00:13:50.20 --> 00:14:02.20
And he'd just come back from a tour in Vietnam as a, as a, the, what's the Navy prop airplane that's there for us had one too.

177
00:14:02.20 --> 00:14:03.20
A1.

178
00:14:03.20 --> 00:14:04.20
A1 Sky Raider.

179
00:14:04.20 --> 00:14:05.20
He'd been an A1 Sky Raider pilot.

180
00:14:05.20 --> 00:14:11.20
He's a fighter pilot, but he'd been an A1 pilot for a tour over there and he told us about it.

181
00:14:11.20 --> 00:14:16.20
And he went cross country with us and he was, he was a fun, a really great leader and a great guy.

182
00:14:16.20 --> 00:14:20.20
So he was the first combat veteran we'd ever met.

183
00:14:20.20 --> 00:14:21.20
And he was single.

184
00:14:21.20 --> 00:14:25.20
So that was fun.

185
00:14:25.20 --> 00:14:28.20
What's the, what's the training aircraft, the T-38?

186
00:14:28.20 --> 00:14:29.20
The T-38.

187
00:14:29.20 --> 00:14:31.20
Is that the same one you use now, Dave?

188
00:14:31.20 --> 00:14:32.20
It's the Air Force still using it.

189
00:14:32.20 --> 00:14:33.20
Yeah.

190
00:14:33.20 --> 00:14:35.20
They've been using it 60 years or so.

191
00:14:35.20 --> 00:14:39.20
It had just come out into the Air Force in 63, 64.

192
00:14:39.20 --> 00:14:45.20
And so it's a supersonic 20-inch and afterburner two-seater.

193
00:14:45.20 --> 00:14:48.20
The fighter version of it was the F-5.

194
00:14:48.20 --> 00:14:49.20
Got it.

195
00:14:49.20 --> 00:14:51.20
But, you know, it would go supersonic.

196
00:14:51.20 --> 00:14:54.20
It would, it would climb great.

197
00:14:54.20 --> 00:14:56.20
It was a great airplane for us to fly.

198
00:14:56.20 --> 00:15:01.20
It flew, it flew faster on final than most of the airplanes do now, you know.

199
00:15:01.20 --> 00:15:05.20
Now, are you competing for that fighter pilot slot?

200
00:15:05.20 --> 00:15:09.20
Yes, but they were going to be plentiful.

201
00:15:09.20 --> 00:15:19.20
I was in, I was in the top 10% of my class until on my contact evaluation of the T-38.

202
00:15:19.20 --> 00:15:25.20
My instructor had told me, well, on the single-engine landing, don't worry too much about your airspeed.

203
00:15:25.20 --> 00:15:30.20
Well, on my check ride, my airspeed was about 10 or 12 knots high and I got downgraded.

204
00:15:30.20 --> 00:15:39.20
And that took me from like third or fourth in my class down to about the 50%ile in my class.

205
00:15:39.20 --> 00:15:41.20
And it just couldn't get back up.

206
00:15:41.20 --> 00:15:44.20
There wasn't enough more check rides to get much higher back up.

207
00:15:44.20 --> 00:15:47.20
So I was probably in the top 40%.

208
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:50.20
But technically in my mind, I knew where I was.

209
00:15:50.20 --> 00:15:52.20
I should have been up there in the 10%.

210
00:15:52.20 --> 00:15:59.20
But the, in my class, which was 67A, it was in 1966.

211
00:15:59.20 --> 00:16:03.20
But the physical year, we graduated in August 1966.

212
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:16.20
Across eight training bases, there were 500, I'm sorry, there were over 800 pilots being trained that whole year.

213
00:16:16.20 --> 00:16:20.20
And over 500 of us got F-4 backseat.

214
00:16:20.20 --> 00:16:22.20
They were putting pilots in the backseat.

215
00:16:22.20 --> 00:16:24.20
Now, the Navy didn't put pilots in the backseat.

216
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:26.20
They put reels.

217
00:16:26.20 --> 00:16:33.20
But the Air Force was trying to get, use money to get more pilots training.

218
00:16:33.20 --> 00:16:34.20
Okay.

219
00:16:34.20 --> 00:16:40.20
So they said to Congress or somebody, hey, we need more pilots because they put in pilots in the backseat.

220
00:16:40.20 --> 00:16:43.20
And so we had to go over there first tour in the backseat.

221
00:16:43.20 --> 00:16:51.20
So, and as I was going through my combat training, there were some of the front seaters that I knew I was a lot better pilot than they were.

222
00:16:51.20 --> 00:16:53.20
But I helped them look good.

223
00:16:53.20 --> 00:16:56.20
Most of them were good, but not all of them.

224
00:16:56.20 --> 00:17:02.20
So you get done with that, you get done with the T-38 and then it's into, then you get assigned the Phantom.

225
00:17:02.20 --> 00:17:03.20
Yes.

226
00:17:03.20 --> 00:17:07.20
And how, but were you assigned the backseat for the Phantom?

227
00:17:07.20 --> 00:17:08.20
Yes.

228
00:17:08.20 --> 00:17:11.20
And then were you mad about that?

229
00:17:11.20 --> 00:17:16.20
Well, I was, but there were only three other single seat fighters in my class.

230
00:17:16.20 --> 00:17:17.20
Okay.

231
00:17:17.20 --> 00:17:26.20
There were one guy got a 105 and one guy got a 102 and everybody else got backseat F4.

232
00:17:26.20 --> 00:17:29.20
So, but there was no choice.

233
00:17:29.20 --> 00:17:38.20
All of us, all my buddies and I went there and, you know, we were going to go do it and pay our dues and get out and go to the front seat or go to another airplane.

234
00:17:38.20 --> 00:17:40.20
So that was kind of a normal pattern.

235
00:17:40.20 --> 00:17:43.20
You'd go to the backseat for a tour and then you get, get into the front seat.

236
00:17:43.20 --> 00:17:57.20
I was actually, I didn't know this, but my buddy Lance Sideson, who went down two days after I did, metal of honor guy, we were, and I was starting, they were starting to fly us a little bit with some instructor pilots who were check pilots.

237
00:17:57.20 --> 00:18:01.20
And they didn't tell us this, but they were going to upgrade us to the front seat in combat.

238
00:18:01.20 --> 00:18:03.20
I found that after I came home.

239
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:10.20
And I thought, that's not very wise to upgrade somebody to the front seat where you didn't even in the backseat, you didn't have a pickle button.

240
00:18:10.20 --> 00:18:14.20
You couldn't pickle the bombs and fire the gun in the backseat.

241
00:18:14.20 --> 00:18:17.20
You could fly the airplane to everything, but you couldn't pickle the.

242
00:18:17.20 --> 00:18:21.20
So you would need further training on that before you moved up there.

243
00:18:21.20 --> 00:18:27.20
The, the F4 Phantom is my favorite American bird.

244
00:18:27.20 --> 00:18:32.20
That thing was just like a modern masterpiece at the time, right?

245
00:18:32.20 --> 00:18:34.20
Yes, it was.

246
00:18:34.20 --> 00:18:44.20
It was a lot of power and it wasn't the sharpest turning one, but it would turn pretty, pretty, pretty dog on good.

247
00:18:44.20 --> 00:18:48.20
It would pull Gs well and it had a lot of power and it could carry a lot of stuff.

248
00:18:48.20 --> 00:18:53.20
The problem was it was built as a Navy long range interceptor.

249
00:18:53.20 --> 00:18:54.20
Okay.

250
00:18:54.20 --> 00:18:56.20
So they didn't have a gun built into it.

251
00:18:56.20 --> 00:18:58.20
Just had it with missiles.

252
00:18:58.20 --> 00:19:01.20
Well, the Air Force wanted it for more air to ground and air to air.

253
00:19:01.20 --> 00:19:11.20
So we actually started carrying a pod gun, a 20 millimeter pod gun underneath in the center station while I was there.

254
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:13.20
And we did quite a bit of that.

255
00:19:13.20 --> 00:19:18.20
It was the same gun that they later built into the airplane in the F4E.

256
00:19:18.20 --> 00:19:21.20
And the, now the ATN now has a 40 millimeter gun.

257
00:19:21.20 --> 00:19:25.20
They built an airplane around the gun, but yeah.

258
00:19:25.20 --> 00:19:30.20
So then when, when you get done with that training, how, how long is it before you go to Vietnam?

259
00:19:30.20 --> 00:19:40.20
Normally the, the replacement training unit, which would be like the RAG and the Navy, the RTU and the Air Force, we went to, I went to George Air Force Base.

260
00:19:40.20 --> 00:19:48.20
There were three different bases that were doing it in the high desert right near where Top Gun works out and was filmed there in the high desert.

261
00:19:48.20 --> 00:19:53.20
And we go there and we do air to ground, air to air refueling and that sort of thing.

262
00:19:53.20 --> 00:19:55.20
And then we deployed straight to war.

263
00:19:55.20 --> 00:20:06.20
The order said, F4, F4 Phantom pipeline Southeast Asia pipeline meant as quick as he gets combat trained, he's going to go to Southeast Asia.

264
00:20:06.20 --> 00:20:09.20
And so now it's 1967.

265
00:20:09.20 --> 00:20:10.20
Yes.

266
00:20:10.20 --> 00:20:13.20
And so now Vietnam is pretty much in full swing.

267
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:14.20
Yes.

268
00:20:14.20 --> 00:20:23.20
And how's that sit with you, with your teammates, you guys just all like that's your goal is to get to Vietnam and fly in.

269
00:20:23.20 --> 00:20:25.20
And I think most of us were, that's where we're going to go.

270
00:20:25.20 --> 00:20:30.20
And they changed our assignment two, three times because the weather over there and different things.

271
00:20:30.20 --> 00:20:37.20
So one time they told us we were going to go to Japan to Masawa and stay there and we go TDY to the war.

272
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:43.20
Well, the wives and kids were getting shots and everything getting ready to go overseas to Japan.

273
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:45.20
And I thought, well, it'll be okay.

274
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:47.20
We're going to take F4Es over to Japan.

275
00:20:47.20 --> 00:20:50.20
And then all of a sudden about two weeks later they said, that's been canceled.

276
00:20:50.20 --> 00:20:52.20
We're back to the original.

277
00:20:52.20 --> 00:20:54.20
And so you're going to go straight to the war.

278
00:20:54.20 --> 00:21:02.20
So the main thing we did though was we got, we'd already had survival training before I went to George to get the combat training.

279
00:21:02.20 --> 00:21:05.20
And so now we go to water survival because we had a little bit of time.

280
00:21:05.20 --> 00:21:07.20
They said, you're not going to go to July.

281
00:21:07.20 --> 00:21:13.20
So I went to water survival and then departed the states on about 30 or 30 June or so.

282
00:21:13.20 --> 00:21:19.20
Headed, went to the Philippines through jungle survival school about a week there in the world.

283
00:21:19.20 --> 00:21:20.20
What year is this?

284
00:21:20.20 --> 00:21:21.20
1967.

285
00:21:21.20 --> 00:21:22.20
Okay.

286
00:21:22.20 --> 00:21:36.20
And then straight from there to Da Nang, which was in the northern part of South Vietnam, about 70 miles south of the DMC that separated North Vietnam from South Vietnam.

287
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:39.20
And so there's, that's where you end up flying out of.

288
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:40.20
That's where your, your base is.

289
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:41.20
Yes.

290
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:42.20
You end up flying out of Da Nang.

291
00:21:42.20 --> 00:21:43.20
Yes.

292
00:21:43.20 --> 00:21:46.20
And we flew a lot of combat stories over the north.

293
00:21:46.20 --> 00:21:47.20
Those were our counters.

294
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:50.20
If you got a hundred stories over the north, you could go home.

295
00:21:50.20 --> 00:21:55.20
If you only flew over South Vietnam, you had to fly for a year before you go back home.

296
00:21:55.20 --> 00:22:13.20
So whenever we could convert a mission in Laos or South Vietnam, get something done and then have a little bit of ammo left, we'd go over to north Vietnam and work with the Ford air controller there, the Missy Facts, and get that counter in.

297
00:22:13.20 --> 00:22:18.20
What was the, what was the main mission that you were getting tasked with doing?

298
00:22:18.20 --> 00:22:20.20
It was, there were two missions.

299
00:22:20.20 --> 00:22:29.20
One was close air support for combat troops in I Corps, which was the northern part of South Vietnam in support of the Marines and the army.

300
00:22:29.20 --> 00:22:30.20
So we would do those.

301
00:22:30.20 --> 00:22:39.20
We would sit alert sometimes for that and we'd get scrambled and go out when they got, are about to get overrun or something, getting attacked and go out and do close air support.

302
00:22:39.20 --> 00:22:40.20
And that was a lot of fun.

303
00:22:40.20 --> 00:22:58.20
But most of our missions, I had about 15 or 18 of those kind of missions, but most of the missions were road recce and bombing of trucks on the road, bombing out bridges, keep the roads bombed out.

304
00:22:58.20 --> 00:23:06.20
So they could not, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, to keep them from bringing truckloads of troops and war materials into South Vietnam.

305
00:23:06.20 --> 00:23:11.20
They would come down south, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which ran parallel to the coastline.

306
00:23:11.20 --> 00:23:21.20
And then as they got to the DMZ, they would cut over into Laos and then go down through Laos and then cut back into South Vietnam.

307
00:23:21.20 --> 00:23:23.20
Because that was the safest way for them to travel.

308
00:23:23.20 --> 00:23:28.20
So that's why we flew into Laos was to blow up those bridges and roads.

309
00:23:28.20 --> 00:23:33.20
And if we could get a convoy of trucks, you know, we could wipe those out pretty quickly.

310
00:23:33.20 --> 00:23:36.20
And that's where that, so that was the main mission that you did?

311
00:23:36.20 --> 00:23:37.20
Yes, it was.

312
00:23:37.20 --> 00:23:48.20
We were flying mixed combat air patrol supporting the bombers, fighter bombers, up around Hanoi when I got there at Da Nang.

313
00:23:48.20 --> 00:24:04.20
Most of those, they were Da Nang and U-Bahn, F-4s were supporting the air support for the 105s, F-4s, F-4s that were flying combat attacks in the Hanoi area up in North Vietnam industrial complex.

314
00:24:04.20 --> 00:24:12.20
But about four or five weeks after I got to Da Nang, the whole policy changed.

315
00:24:12.20 --> 00:24:25.20
12th Air Force was in Saigon and we were part of 12th Air Force, I'm sorry, 7th Air Force, and 12th Air Force controlled Laos and I'm sorry, controlled Thailand.

316
00:24:25.20 --> 00:24:31.20
And that's where we had four main bases in Thailand who were flying missions out of.

317
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:36.20
And a lot of them were going over North Vietnam into the Hanoi area.

318
00:24:36.20 --> 00:24:44.20
So we lost the bombing and the combat air patrol support, MiG-CAP, I guess you call it, MiG-CAP.

319
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:52.20
We lost that about a month after I got there, so I did not get to go on the MiG patrol up around Hanoi.

320
00:24:52.20 --> 00:24:55.20
And I was very disappointed because that's what I'd always wanted to do.

321
00:24:55.20 --> 00:24:56.20
Was just dogfight.

322
00:24:56.20 --> 00:24:58.20
Yeah, dogfight.

323
00:24:58.20 --> 00:25:00.20
Just pull plane against plane.

324
00:25:00.20 --> 00:25:02.20
Did you ever see any MiGs?

325
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:04.20
Not from the air.

326
00:25:04.20 --> 00:25:06.20
I've seen them on the ground.

327
00:25:06.20 --> 00:25:10.20
When I was in prison up there, I saw them a few times.

328
00:25:10.20 --> 00:25:14.20
Do you remember your very first mission that you flew?

329
00:25:14.20 --> 00:25:20.20
Was it, you know, for like guys going into ground combat, you kind of remember the first time you rolled outside the wire?

330
00:25:20.20 --> 00:25:25.20
Was your first mission, was it monumental in your brain or was it just like, oh, another day?

331
00:25:25.20 --> 00:25:29.20
It was just like going out to the range and bombing, really.

332
00:25:29.20 --> 00:25:31.20
It was kind of more like that.

333
00:25:31.20 --> 00:25:33.20
It seems like these...

334
00:25:33.20 --> 00:25:34.20
I got shot at.

335
00:25:34.20 --> 00:25:37.20
I'd say most of all the missions we got shot at.

336
00:25:37.20 --> 00:25:43.20
And we'd come home and have some bullet holes from ground fire, mostly.

337
00:25:43.20 --> 00:25:47.20
I never got hit by any real AAA, I don't think, up there.

338
00:25:47.20 --> 00:25:54.20
I didn't have any big holes blowing up my airplane, but it was common to have, you know, ground fire rifles.

339
00:25:54.20 --> 00:25:58.20
Did you feel like the threat when you were flying up there?

340
00:25:58.20 --> 00:26:01.20
What was the threat level that you felt?

341
00:26:01.20 --> 00:26:08.20
I know in the book you end up mentioning you had, I think, three of your friends had been shot down.

342
00:26:08.20 --> 00:26:14.20
Like, how often is that happening where guys are getting shot down and you're rolling up there?

343
00:26:14.20 --> 00:26:21.20
What's your impression, or did you have the typical young man's impression, which, hey, it's too bad it happened to someone else,

344
00:26:21.20 --> 00:26:23.20
but it sure is not going to happen to me. I'm too good.

345
00:26:23.20 --> 00:26:25.20
Well, it was kind of that.

346
00:26:25.20 --> 00:26:27.20
But it was sad, too.

347
00:26:27.20 --> 00:26:35.20
I'd lost two roommates before I was shot down and another one after I was shot down.

348
00:26:35.20 --> 00:26:40.20
But there were a lot of people shot down.

349
00:26:40.20 --> 00:26:46.20
The summer and going into the fall of 1967, it was a huge number of people shot down

350
00:26:46.20 --> 00:26:50.20
because our combat missions increased significantly

351
00:26:50.20 --> 00:26:57.20
and there, and aircraft artillery, surface air missiles increased significantly during that time.

352
00:26:57.20 --> 00:27:01.20
So it was pretty common for airplanes to be going down.

353
00:27:01.20 --> 00:27:10.20
Did you feel like the skill level that it takes to drop bombs back in your day?

354
00:27:10.20 --> 00:27:14.20
I mean, nowadays it's a computer that's doing it. The computer's doing all the work.

355
00:27:14.20 --> 00:27:19.20
And you're just inputting the numbers and it's going to put that bomb wherever you tell that bomb to go.

356
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:22.20
Did you feel like you're getting better?

357
00:27:22.20 --> 00:27:25.20
Were some guys better than other guys?

358
00:27:25.20 --> 00:27:31.20
In the SEAL teams, which I was in, you got this guy over here, he's really good, long range shot with his rifle.

359
00:27:31.20 --> 00:27:34.20
He's going to be super accurate. This other guy maybe is not so great.

360
00:27:34.20 --> 00:27:40.20
Did you guys have that kind of pecking order in terms of, hey, Lee's getting sent out to get this bridge

361
00:27:40.20 --> 00:27:43.20
because we know he's good or hey, don't send Lee out to get that bridge.

362
00:27:43.20 --> 00:27:47.20
Maybe he's not the best of our guys. Did you guys have that kind of pecking order?

363
00:27:47.20 --> 00:27:56.20
Yes and no. The flight commanders were generally established fighter pilots at that time.

364
00:27:56.20 --> 00:28:01.20
And so they were usually the best in the squadron. So they were set an example.

365
00:28:01.20 --> 00:28:12.20
But at this time, because of the war in 1967, by the summer of 1967, all the fighter pilots have gone over and done their year

366
00:28:12.20 --> 00:28:19.20
and come home, not all, but many, the first big chunk of them. And they don't want to send them right back.

367
00:28:19.20 --> 00:28:28.20
So they brought in guys from B-52s, from C-130s to become F-4 front-seaters in fighter pilots.

368
00:28:28.20 --> 00:28:36.20
Well, us back-seaters who had just been flying the T-38, we knew that one of our jobs was to keep them safe

369
00:28:36.20 --> 00:28:38.20
and help them be fighter pilots.

370
00:28:38.20 --> 00:28:43.20
Seriously, I mean, they were good pilots, but they just hadn't been flying fighter airplanes.

371
00:28:43.20 --> 00:28:48.20
And they were a little bit more cautious and slower thinking, I think, sometimes.

372
00:28:48.20 --> 00:28:53.20
And so we were almost coaching. There were times I was coaching the guy in the front seat.

373
00:28:53.20 --> 00:28:57.20
Now, don't roll in yet. We're not close enough to roll in yet.

374
00:28:57.20 --> 00:29:11.20
So, you know, it's hard to say, but most of the time when I flew with the more senior guys and who experienced fighter pilots, they were really good.

375
00:29:11.20 --> 00:29:24.20
And what about like, so you deploy in 1967, you're over there, the political thing in America of, you know, the war protests, they weren't really strong in 1967.

376
00:29:24.20 --> 00:29:29.20
No, it wasn't going strong yet. It was just starting to roll in certain parts of the country.

377
00:29:29.20 --> 00:29:43.20
I think the thing for me, I realized very quickly, and most of the pilots realized very quickly, that we were not fighting this war in the right way.

378
00:29:43.20 --> 00:29:53.20
And you saw that even from your time, you're a first lieutenant. You've been in the Navy for, or sorry, you've been in the Air Force for a short period of time.

379
00:29:53.20 --> 00:30:01.20
And you're already seeing, as a first lieutenant on your first deployment, this maybe doesn't make the most sense.

380
00:30:01.20 --> 00:30:07.20
Yes, I did see that. I said, why don't you let me figure out how to pick the targets?

381
00:30:07.20 --> 00:30:09.20
I mean, I did. I wanted to say.

382
00:30:09.20 --> 00:30:12.20
The targets are getting picked by like Washington D.C. and stuff, right?

383
00:30:12.20 --> 00:30:15.20
Yes, yes, exactly. And I'd say, well, here's how we need to do this.

384
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:25.20
We need to go up there and bomb out the roads, you know, just bomb them out in certain specific places intentionally, about an hour before dark.

385
00:30:25.20 --> 00:30:31.20
And then as quick as it gets dark, the trucks will back up and we'll go in and strafe them all and wipe them out.

386
00:30:31.20 --> 00:30:36.20
Well, that would took me about a month to figure that out.

387
00:30:36.20 --> 00:30:41.20
And sometimes we did that, and sometimes we didn't, but it wasn't part of the plan.

388
00:30:41.20 --> 00:30:47.20
There was no plan to do that. You had to fly authorities to some degree to when Saigon said fly them.

389
00:30:47.20 --> 00:30:53.20
And to a large degree up around Hanoi, you could only fly them when they told you to.

390
00:30:53.20 --> 00:30:56.20
And of course, the enemy knew exactly when we were coming.

391
00:30:56.20 --> 00:31:06.20
So it was just ridiculous that so many decisions about what to bomb and when to bomb it was made in Washington D.C. by civilians who knew nothing about warfare.

392
00:31:06.20 --> 00:31:10.20
And even you as a first lieutenant, you're what, 23 years old, 24 years old?

393
00:31:10.20 --> 00:31:13.20
I was 23 when I got there.

394
00:31:13.20 --> 00:31:18.20
23 years old, you're just driving around a muscle car in America as a knuckle draggler.

395
00:31:18.20 --> 00:31:23.20
And even you figured out, hey, you can't micromanage this thing from Washington D.C.

396
00:31:23.20 --> 00:31:29.20
Yes. And I was, it was kind of down. It was kind of a downer for me.

397
00:31:29.20 --> 00:31:34.20
It's like, why can't somebody stand up and fix this, you know?

398
00:31:34.20 --> 00:31:43.20
At this point, are you seeing the POWs, any of that propaganda stuff that would come out over the years?

399
00:31:43.20 --> 00:31:46.20
Are you already seeing that some of that stuff?

400
00:31:46.20 --> 00:31:48.20
You mean in our culture?

401
00:31:48.20 --> 00:31:51.20
Yeah. So, so in other words, you're there, you're flying.

402
00:31:51.20 --> 00:31:58.20
At this point, obviously pilots had been shot down, pilots had been captured, soldiers, sailors had been captured.

403
00:31:58.20 --> 00:32:04.20
And that propaganda, you know, as POWs, is it not really out in 1967 yet?

404
00:32:04.20 --> 00:32:05.20
No.

405
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:09.20
They weren't really pushing that hard, the Vietnamese to get that propaganda out.

406
00:32:09.20 --> 00:32:13.20
No, we had not, I had not heard any propaganda from POW camps.

407
00:32:13.20 --> 00:32:16.20
I didn't know anything about the POW camps of what was happening.

408
00:32:16.20 --> 00:32:21.20
I'm sure some folks did, but I knew some of my buddies had been captured,

409
00:32:21.20 --> 00:32:27.20
but I did not know what was happening there other than it was a, they were probably prisoners.

410
00:32:27.20 --> 00:32:34.20
So how many, how long had you been there before you ended up getting shot down?

411
00:32:34.20 --> 00:32:41.20
Well, I got there around the 3rd of July and I was shot down to 7th of November.

412
00:32:41.20 --> 00:32:51.20
And at that point, I had 53 missions over North Vietnam and another, I don't know, 15 or 16 or so over South Vietnam and Laos.

413
00:32:51.20 --> 00:32:57.20
All right, well, probably a good time for me to pick up this book.

414
00:32:57.20 --> 00:33:02.20
The book is called Leading with Honor Leadership Lessons from the Hulley Hilton.

415
00:33:02.20 --> 00:33:04.20
This is just out of the gate.

416
00:33:04.20 --> 00:33:07.20
We're starting it off from the book.

417
00:33:07.20 --> 00:33:17.20
It says this November 7th, 1967, four o'clock p.m. Captain Ken Fisher and I rolled into a dive bomb pass in our F4C Phantom jet.

418
00:33:17.20 --> 00:33:28.20
As we swoop downward, our bird with turned up wing tips, elevated tail and deafening roar must have resembled a high-tech version of a prehistoric pterodactyl.

419
00:33:28.20 --> 00:33:34.20
Tracers from the North Vietnamese anti-aircraft artillery flashed by our canopy like giant Roman candles,

420
00:33:34.20 --> 00:33:39.20
their explosions encircling us with ominous puffs of gray and black smoke,

421
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:45.20
each representing hundreds of shards of shrapnel designed to mortally wound our beautiful beast.

422
00:33:45.20 --> 00:33:49.20
As our jet plunged toward the artillery positions at 500 miles an hour,

423
00:33:49.20 --> 00:33:55.20
the earth enlarged in our windscreen as if we were adjusting the zoom on a telephoto lens.

424
00:33:55.20 --> 00:34:01.20
It was eyeball to eyeball stare down with the enemy, with each side expecting the other to die.

425
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:05.20
When you face enemy fire, you are at the point of the sword.

426
00:34:05.20 --> 00:34:09.20
Ken and I had been around long enough to know that the sword of combat cuts both ways.

427
00:34:09.20 --> 00:34:14.20
We had lost three close friends in similar situations in the prior two months.

428
00:34:14.20 --> 00:34:20.20
We released our heavy payload of bombs and our lightened plane lurched upward.

429
00:34:20.20 --> 00:34:23.20
Suddenly an explosion rocked our aircraft.

430
00:34:23.20 --> 00:34:31.20
A terrifying sound like marbles in a blender alerted me that the metal of our expensive flying machine was ripping apart.

431
00:34:31.20 --> 00:34:35.20
The cockpit was still intact but it was rapidly filling with smoke.

432
00:34:35.20 --> 00:34:41.20
The control stick was frozen at full aft right and we were tumbling end over end through the sky.

433
00:34:41.20 --> 00:34:47.20
Just before bomb release we had been at 6000 feet descending rapidly in a steep dive.

434
00:34:47.20 --> 00:34:53.20
Now on fire and out of control there was only one option, eject.

435
00:34:53.20 --> 00:34:55.20
But that was impossible.

436
00:34:55.20 --> 00:35:00.20
I was upside down, floating out of my seat with my head pushed against the top of the canopy.

437
00:35:00.20 --> 00:35:06.20
If I ejected while we were in negative Gs, I would suffer severe injury, even death.

438
00:35:06.20 --> 00:35:13.20
But time was running out, at our rate of descent we would soon be out of the envelope for safe ejection.

439
00:35:13.20 --> 00:35:17.20
Suddenly the cockpit flipped again and I felt pressure in my seat.

440
00:35:17.20 --> 00:35:19.20
Positive Gs, it was now or never.

441
00:35:19.20 --> 00:35:23.20
I sat upright and pulled the ejection handle.

442
00:35:23.20 --> 00:35:29.20
An explosive charge fired blowing away the canopy, still strapped in my seat I was blasted free of the aircraft.

443
00:35:29.20 --> 00:35:37.20
Like a carnival stunt artist shot from a cannon at an acceleration force 18 times the force of gravity.

444
00:35:37.20 --> 00:35:42.20
Now if this expensive one time use Martin Baker ejection system was going to save my life,

445
00:35:42.20 --> 00:35:46.20
it would have to falllessly execute a remarkably complex series of events.

446
00:35:46.20 --> 00:35:52.20
A half a second later the man seat separator worked as advertised firing a blast of compressed air

447
00:35:52.20 --> 00:36:01.20
to the open lap belt connecting pin freeing me from the heavy seat and triggering the appropriately named butt snapper.

448
00:36:01.20 --> 00:36:06.20
A folded nylon belt under my seat that mechanically snapped tight thrusting me into space.

449
00:36:06.20 --> 00:36:12.20
As the ejection seat moved away the attached lanyard pulled out the D-ring deploying my parachute.

450
00:36:12.20 --> 00:36:21.20
The F-4 Phantoms marvelously engineered James Bond like a escape system had snatched me from the jaws of death in less than two seconds.

451
00:36:21.20 --> 00:36:30.20
But much like Bond's adventures escape from one danger only brought another.

452
00:36:30.20 --> 00:36:41.20
So when you're in negative G's you can't eject. That's the rule?

453
00:36:41.20 --> 00:36:47.20
Well if you do you might just smash your head on the canopy.

454
00:36:47.20 --> 00:36:50.20
And then it'll just break your neck and kill you?

455
00:36:50.20 --> 00:36:52.20
Yeah, it could. Yeah.

456
00:36:52.20 --> 00:37:01.20
So you're going 500 miles an hour and you're 5,000 feet. How many seconds is that? How far are we from impact?

457
00:37:01.20 --> 00:37:06.20
Two or three at the most I guess. It would have come very quickly.

458
00:37:06.20 --> 00:37:11.20
Now once the airplane blew up and was tumbling it wasn't going 500 miles an hour.

459
00:37:11.20 --> 00:37:18.20
We were probably between 450 and 500 miles an hour when the bombs came off and we blew up.

460
00:37:18.20 --> 00:37:25.20
And then within another second we're tumbling and so it's slowing down.

461
00:37:25.20 --> 00:37:33.20
You know that part, it all happened so quickly. This is within less than a second.

462
00:37:33.20 --> 00:37:41.20
It happened so quickly. I don't remember exactly except I knew I had negative G's and I needed positive G's.

463
00:37:41.20 --> 00:37:48.20
And it did a little longer and it flipped and there it was and I pulled that handle and Ken did too.

464
00:37:48.20 --> 00:37:52.20
And it was just unreal that we got out to be honest.

465
00:37:52.20 --> 00:38:00.20
Let me tell you one thing. We were the first, I didn't know this till several years later,

466
00:38:00.20 --> 00:38:06.20
we were the first probably to be blown out of the sky by the FMU-35 fuse.

467
00:38:06.20 --> 00:38:18.20
Because when it came off in less than two seconds, when there were bad fuses, there was a new fuse with a new type chemical reaction or whatever.

468
00:38:18.20 --> 00:38:21.20
But some of them were bad.

469
00:38:21.20 --> 00:38:23.20
So what is this FMU-35 fuse?

470
00:38:23.20 --> 00:38:32.20
It goes into the head of the bomb. It's crazy and it was a timed fuser so you could drop it and it would lay on the ground

471
00:38:32.20 --> 00:38:36.20
and wait for 10 seconds to blow up or wait for an hour to blow up.

472
00:38:36.20 --> 00:38:44.20
Okay. Well, we didn't even know, we were the first ones to ever fly with that and we were not supposed to be flying with it.

473
00:38:44.20 --> 00:38:50.20
We had not been told. We had been told they were coming but we had not been told that we had one.

474
00:38:50.20 --> 00:38:57.20
So I wouldn't know when I did the bomb inspection, the armament inspection, I wouldn't know an FMU-35 fuse different from another one.

475
00:38:57.20 --> 00:39:06.20
It was just a fuse. But hours blew up. They blew up in 1.8 seconds after they came off and boom.

476
00:39:06.20 --> 00:39:12.20
And most of the people that had that happen died.

477
00:39:12.20 --> 00:39:15.20
My roommate died two weeks later from that.

478
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:23.20
And this is because he's shooting the missile and it's detonating 1.8 seconds later and it's not far enough away? Is that?

479
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:25.20
No. It was dropping a bomb.

480
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:26.20
Okay.

481
00:39:26.20 --> 00:39:33.20
And when it comes off, it detonates in 1.8 seconds after it's released, which is maybe 100 feet from where you are.

482
00:39:33.20 --> 00:39:36.20
It's going to parallel you to some degree.

483
00:39:36.20 --> 00:39:37.20
Right.

484
00:39:37.20 --> 00:39:46.20
Okay. And it blew up maybe 200, 300 feet under us and all that shrapnel out of one blew up all the rest of them.

485
00:39:46.20 --> 00:39:50.20
And so all these bombs blew up and it blew our air.

486
00:39:50.20 --> 00:39:55.20
Normally when you get hit by aircraft artillery, it doesn't blow your airplane up.

487
00:39:55.20 --> 00:40:03.20
It might blow off part of the wing or it might blow up part of your tail or shoot a hole through your fuel tank or your engine and blow out your engine.

488
00:40:03.20 --> 00:40:06.20
But it doesn't blow your airplane apart.

489
00:40:06.20 --> 00:40:13.20
So that in itself is very unusual for an airplane to be blown up by an aircraft artillery.

490
00:40:13.20 --> 00:40:24.20
Well, we found out several years later a POW, I was putting another cell with a POW and he was telling me about how he was blown out of the sky.

491
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:37.20
By his wingman, his flight leads bombs going off and he said at the name we had lost like 12, 10 or 12 airplanes over a period of about six weeks and almost all of them died.

492
00:40:37.20 --> 00:40:38.20
Very few of them were recovered.

493
00:40:38.20 --> 00:40:40.20
So is that what happened to your bird?

494
00:40:40.20 --> 00:40:41.20
Yes.

495
00:40:41.20 --> 00:40:43.20
And we didn't know that.

496
00:40:43.20 --> 00:40:45.20
You thought you got hit?

497
00:40:45.20 --> 00:40:46.20
Yeah.

498
00:40:46.20 --> 00:40:50.20
Because there was a lot of AAA, you know, tracers right going right by the cockpit.

499
00:40:50.20 --> 00:40:54.20
So what else would you think? Nothing else.

500
00:40:54.20 --> 00:41:02.20
It had to be that until we found out that what it was like to be blown out of the sky by the FMU 35 views.

501
00:41:02.20 --> 00:41:10.20
And it happened, let's say John, my buddy, two days later, Doug Condit, my roommate, two weeks later.

502
00:41:10.20 --> 00:41:12.20
And neither one of them came home.

503
00:41:12.20 --> 00:41:17.20
So and they were great guys, great pilots, incredible men.

504
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:19.20
Wow.

505
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:21.20
That's horrible.

506
00:41:21.20 --> 00:41:25.20
Man, talk about a lack of communication.

507
00:41:25.20 --> 00:41:27.20
That's just that's crazy to think about.

508
00:41:27.20 --> 00:41:38.20
Well, they never really solved the problem and, you know, between the industrial and military.

509
00:41:38.20 --> 00:41:43.20
No one takes ownership of the problems and no one solves the problems.

510
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:45.20
Okay.

511
00:41:45.20 --> 00:41:53.20
And finally, the Wing Commander, General Colonel Boussé, was a pretty famous guy being an ace of the Korean War.

512
00:41:53.20 --> 00:42:01.20
But he went down to Saigon and said, you can court martial me, but we're not going to fly those anymore.

513
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:05.20
Wow.

514
00:42:05.20 --> 00:42:07.20
Going back to the book here.

515
00:42:07.20 --> 00:42:15.20
He had ejected from the womb of the F4 into a very unfunny world hanging in the parachute without my shallow protection.

516
00:42:15.20 --> 00:42:17.20
I felt exposed and vulnerable.

517
00:42:17.20 --> 00:42:19.20
Gunfire cracked below and bullets whizzed by me.

518
00:42:19.20 --> 00:42:25.20
Instinctively, I followed the procedures ingrained by regular refresher training since entering flight school.

519
00:42:25.20 --> 00:42:27.20
Check for a fully open shoot.

520
00:42:27.20 --> 00:42:29.20
Activate the emergency beeper.

521
00:42:29.20 --> 00:42:31.20
Decide on deploying a life raft.

522
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:33.20
Pick a spot to land and steer your parachute.

523
00:42:33.20 --> 00:42:37.20
And then go to the parachute landing fall PLF.

524
00:42:37.20 --> 00:42:39.20
So you're going through the motions.

525
00:42:39.20 --> 00:42:43.20
You're thinking through your training.

526
00:42:43.20 --> 00:42:45.20
I had one goal and that was to make capture.

527
00:42:45.20 --> 00:42:48.20
And I was going, my training, it was unreal.

528
00:42:48.20 --> 00:42:52.20
I couldn't believe that I was so focused on my training and what I was doing here.

529
00:42:52.20 --> 00:42:58.20
The enemy is still shooting at the wingman and bullets are going by and I'm just focusing on what I'm supposed to do.

530
00:42:58.20 --> 00:43:00.20
Could you see Ken Fisher?

531
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:02.20
No.

532
00:43:02.20 --> 00:43:04.20
He was about half mile away.

533
00:43:04.20 --> 00:43:07.20
When you eject, do both of you get ejected?

534
00:43:07.20 --> 00:43:08.20
No.

535
00:43:08.20 --> 00:43:11.20
So one person, so you each have to pull your ejection handle?

536
00:43:11.20 --> 00:43:14.20
Some airplanes are that way but ours wasn't.

537
00:43:14.20 --> 00:43:15.20
You know, the F-4 wasn't that way.

538
00:43:15.20 --> 00:43:17.20
So you don't know if he made it out at this point?

539
00:43:17.20 --> 00:43:18.20
No.

540
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:19.20
You don't know if he ejected or not?

541
00:43:19.20 --> 00:43:20.20
No.

542
00:43:20.20 --> 00:43:27.20
I'm looking down and I can see the ocean just a few miles, three or four miles away.

543
00:43:27.20 --> 00:43:32.20
And we were attacking the gun protection for the Quine Key Ferry.

544
00:43:32.20 --> 00:43:39.20
That's what the four-air controller put us on to bomb those gun areas.

545
00:43:39.20 --> 00:43:41.20
And so I know where I am.

546
00:43:41.20 --> 00:43:45.20
I've flown to this area a lot and so I made a radio call.

547
00:43:45.20 --> 00:43:51.20
As soon as I got on the ground, I did my parachute landing fall and I hit all the points, jumped into an old bomb crater,

548
00:43:51.20 --> 00:43:58.20
pulled out my radio and on guard said, hey, I'm on the ground, 200 meters north of the river,

549
00:43:58.20 --> 00:44:00.20
start strafing at 300, I'm headed south.

550
00:44:00.20 --> 00:44:06.20
Because I thought if I could get in that river, I could evade and get picked up out by the Navy.

551
00:44:06.20 --> 00:44:12.20
Well, I saw the flight lead after I came home at a fighter pilot reunion.

552
00:44:12.20 --> 00:44:17.20
He said, hey man, I heard you a radio call but I decided I couldn't shoot that good.

553
00:44:17.20 --> 00:44:25.20
I didn't want to hit you and I said very wise because they surrounded me and captured me within 90 seconds.

554
00:44:25.20 --> 00:44:27.20
Yeah, you're saying the book.

555
00:44:27.20 --> 00:44:33.20
In less than 60 seconds, the militia troops formed a semi-circle about 30 yards away and began moving toward me.

556
00:44:33.20 --> 00:44:40.20
Survival instructors had taught us the best chance to escape as immediately after capture because frontline soldiers are typically the least trained in handling prisoners.

557
00:44:40.20 --> 00:44:46.20
Deciding to try to bluff, I drew my 38 caliber six-shot revolver, Smith and Wesson,

558
00:44:46.20 --> 00:44:51.20
combat masterpiece which was loaded with two rounds of tracer and three of regular ball ammo.

559
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:56.20
Could these rookies be scared off? I would challenge them and find out.

560
00:44:56.20 --> 00:45:01.20
The first three stepped out from chest high bushes and pointed their rifles at me.

561
00:45:01.20 --> 00:45:07.20
I raised my revolver, motion for them to get back and fired a tracer round over their heads.

562
00:45:07.20 --> 00:45:11.20
Without flinching, they shouldered their rifles and pointed them at me.

563
00:45:11.20 --> 00:45:15.20
Why they didn't cut me down right then, I'll never know.

564
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:19.20
I can only assume God had other plans for my life.

565
00:45:19.20 --> 00:45:24.20
So you took a crack at these guys with your 38?

566
00:45:24.20 --> 00:45:28.20
I'll tell you what. How you survived that, I have no idea.

567
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:33.20
I just wanted to scare them. I fired it over their head. Tracer, you know.

568
00:45:33.20 --> 00:45:37.20
In the heat of the battle, that's just all I was thinking.

569
00:45:37.20 --> 00:45:42.20
Yeah, I mean please, anyone out there, if you point a weapon at me and you pull the trigger,

570
00:45:42.20 --> 00:45:45.20
actually if you point a weapon at me, you're going to die.

571
00:45:45.20 --> 00:45:50.20
So the fact that you just shot a tracer at these guys to try and scare them off,

572
00:45:50.20 --> 00:45:57.20
but they must have been there clearly, the value of a prisoner must have been so high to them

573
00:45:57.20 --> 00:46:04.20
and they knew that and that's why they said, oh no buddy, you're not getting out that easy.

574
00:46:04.20 --> 00:46:08.20
Continuing on, you say, one of the militiamen pulled, and by the way, I'm reading this book,

575
00:46:08.20 --> 00:46:12.20
I'm reading some excerpts. You got to get the book, I'm skipping a bunch of stuff.

576
00:46:12.20 --> 00:46:15.20
There's all kinds of awesome details in here of what's going through your mind.

577
00:46:15.20 --> 00:46:20.20
Like you got to get the book, I'm just trying to give some of the highlights.

578
00:46:20.20 --> 00:46:22.20
They're not even all the highlights, there's some of the highlights.

579
00:46:22.20 --> 00:46:25.20
One of the militiamen pulled out a pamphlet.

580
00:46:25.20 --> 00:46:30.20
I recognized it as a pointy, talky, a tool of the Vietnamese military

581
00:46:30.20 --> 00:46:34.20
that showed drawings of American pilots being captured along with Vietnamese phonetics

582
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:39.20
for English commands, referring to his booklet, he began to shout, handshop, handshop,

583
00:46:39.20 --> 00:46:42.20
shirendo, no die, shirendo, no die.

584
00:46:42.20 --> 00:46:46.20
Aviators have a number of expressions for being in deep trouble.

585
00:46:46.20 --> 00:46:51.20
One of the nicer ones is out of airspeed and ideas.

586
00:46:51.20 --> 00:46:55.20
That precisely described my situation.

587
00:46:55.20 --> 00:46:59.20
I figured you'd like that one, Dave, out of airspeed and ideas.

588
00:46:59.20 --> 00:47:01.20
Not a good place to be.

589
00:47:01.20 --> 00:47:04.20
I tossed aside my pistol, raised my hands, not knowing what to expect.

590
00:47:04.20 --> 00:47:08.20
Immediately my captors grabbed me and began tugging at my survival vest, anti-G suit,

591
00:47:08.20 --> 00:47:14.20
and flight suit, my last vestiges of protection.

592
00:47:14.20 --> 00:47:19.20
And here's the psychological view of what's going through your mind.

593
00:47:19.20 --> 00:47:22.20
Up until the time of surrender, I had operated like a computer,

594
00:47:22.20 --> 00:47:25.20
calculating and processing at nanosecond speed.

595
00:47:25.20 --> 00:47:30.20
My training programs had translated into almost flawless execution,

596
00:47:30.20 --> 00:47:34.20
from the credit to the military way, and those who did the training.

597
00:47:34.20 --> 00:47:39.20
Now, out of control and with no power, this cool, somewhat cocky fighter pilot

598
00:47:39.20 --> 00:47:42.20
felt all alone and very scared.

599
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:46.20
Captured and in enemy hands, what lay in store?

600
00:47:46.20 --> 00:47:48.20
Would I be tortured, killed?

601
00:47:48.20 --> 00:47:52.20
The shock of my predicament made the whole affair seem like a dream.

602
00:47:52.20 --> 00:47:55.20
I knew this was happening to me, but I also felt like an observer,

603
00:47:55.20 --> 00:47:59.20
as if participating in an out-of-body experience.

604
00:47:59.20 --> 00:48:03.20
Only this nightmare was real, and I would need to adopt a new mindset,

605
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:10.20
a new game face to fight a different kind of battle, a battle of minds and wills.

606
00:48:10.20 --> 00:48:18.20
You were in enemy hands in 90 seconds from hitting the ground.

607
00:48:18.20 --> 00:48:20.20
Yes.

608
00:48:20.20 --> 00:48:24.20
Is that just bad luck? How does that even happen?

609
00:48:24.20 --> 00:48:31.20
That happened quite a bit, because usually we're in more populated areas,

610
00:48:31.20 --> 00:48:34.20
and there are going to be militia or farmers.

611
00:48:34.20 --> 00:48:40.20
Farmers came with axes or shovels or whatever to capture you.

612
00:48:40.20 --> 00:48:47.20
So it was good to be captured, but if you're going to be captured better by the militia than the farmers.

613
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:52.20
Is there a massive relief of just survival?

614
00:48:52.20 --> 00:48:57.20
The fact that you made it out of the aircraft that blew up underneath you,

615
00:48:57.20 --> 00:49:01.20
and now you're on the ground, you got to at least feel good that you're alive.

616
00:49:01.20 --> 00:49:03.20
Or was that not there?

617
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:07.20
I guess I was just focused on the moment.

618
00:49:07.20 --> 00:49:16.20
I didn't, at that point, if this is just part of my day that I'm dealing with,

619
00:49:16.20 --> 00:49:22.20
I wasn't thinking that I guess, I don't know, maybe I was thinking I'm glad I'm alive,

620
00:49:22.20 --> 00:49:25.20
but that only lasted for a second.

621
00:49:25.20 --> 00:49:29.20
Now I'm dealing with the realities of what's going to happen next.

622
00:49:29.20 --> 00:49:38.20
And I suppose that just overshadowed any sort of, like, for lack of a better word, celebration that you left.

623
00:49:38.20 --> 00:49:42.20
Although you did mention in the book, as you were under canopy, you were kind of looking around like,

624
00:49:42.20 --> 00:49:46.20
oh, it's kind of nice up here, you saw the ocean, hey, if I can get to the ocean.

625
00:49:46.20 --> 00:49:50.20
And then you heard them yelling and shooting.

626
00:49:50.20 --> 00:49:51.20
It didn't take but a second.

627
00:49:51.20 --> 00:49:57.20
I looked back over and I knew up the river there was disappearing cave, because I knew about that.

628
00:49:57.20 --> 00:50:04.20
The river went into the cave and they would hide their sampans and ships, boats up there during the daytime

629
00:50:04.20 --> 00:50:11.20
and bring them out at night to ferry boats to ferry these guys across the river, the trucks across the river.

630
00:50:11.20 --> 00:50:15.20
So I was looking over that way and then I looked over here and there's the ocean.

631
00:50:15.20 --> 00:50:17.20
Don Hoey, the city was over there.

632
00:50:17.20 --> 00:50:23.20
So it was beautiful, but that took about a split second.

633
00:50:23.20 --> 00:50:26.20
Dave, did you ever grab your ejection handle?

634
00:50:26.20 --> 00:50:30.20
No, I never reached for the handle.

635
00:50:30.20 --> 00:50:31.20
I thought about it once.

636
00:50:31.20 --> 00:50:32.20
What was going on?

637
00:50:32.20 --> 00:50:36.20
It was just a mechanical problem that I had with an airplane.

638
00:50:36.20 --> 00:50:45.20
Very similar, it was actually in a dive and back up, I don't want to even draw a comparison between what you just described

639
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:49.20
and what happened to you in mind, but the feeling of going really fast downhill.

640
00:50:49.20 --> 00:50:52.20
I really like the way you described the way the earth comes up.

641
00:50:52.20 --> 00:50:57.20
It's like a telephoto zoom lens as you're rotating that lens, how quickly it comes up.

642
00:50:57.20 --> 00:51:03.20
When things don't work going downhill, you're much more inclined to leave the airplane when things aren't working going uphill.

643
00:51:03.20 --> 00:51:12.20
It's hard to listen to because in my brain when you say you see the ocean and that airplane, I just wish you just want the airplane to climb up.

644
00:51:12.20 --> 00:51:16.20
Even if it's out of power, you just want it to get up into the air and it's such a better place to be.

645
00:51:16.20 --> 00:51:20.20
The fact that you're going downhill is such a heartbreaking thing to hear because you have such few options.

646
00:51:20.20 --> 00:51:27.20
So I guess my answer is yes and no, nothing like that, but that feeling of I got a problem going downhill, you're much more inclined to leave.

647
00:51:27.20 --> 00:51:33.20
I remember thinking about it for a split second, no, no, I can actually solve this problem unlike your problem is not solvable.

648
00:51:33.20 --> 00:51:36.20
But going downhill is not cool when you got a problem.

649
00:51:36.20 --> 00:51:38.20
You ever heard the term ground rush?

650
00:51:38.20 --> 00:51:40.20
I have heard that term.

651
00:51:40.20 --> 00:51:41.20
Absolutely.

652
00:51:41.20 --> 00:51:44.20
Okay, so we only know it from freefall perish.

653
00:51:44.20 --> 00:51:46.20
So it's a thing for pilots as well.

654
00:51:46.20 --> 00:51:47.20
Ground rush?

655
00:51:47.20 --> 00:51:54.20
Yeah, it's like the ground is coming, but then all of a sudden it starts coming really fast.

656
00:51:54.20 --> 00:51:57.20
The lower you get, the faster it starts going.

657
00:51:57.20 --> 00:52:07.20
I have one parachute cutaway, meaning my main parachute failed and I had to get rid of that parachute and pull my reserve parachute.

658
00:52:07.20 --> 00:52:09.20
That only happened to me one time.

659
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:12.20
And for me, it was very mechanical mind.

660
00:52:12.20 --> 00:52:16.20
My mind was just, oh, you know, I'm looking at my perimeter trying to clear the problem.

661
00:52:16.20 --> 00:52:18.20
Look at my timeter trying to clear the problem.

662
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:19.20
Parachutes not good.

663
00:52:19.20 --> 00:52:22.20
Okay, I'm at the cutaway altitude supposed to be 2000 feet.

664
00:52:22.20 --> 00:52:24.20
I got to 1900 feet. I was like, yep, you need to cut this thing away.

665
00:52:24.20 --> 00:52:25.20
And I just did it.

666
00:52:25.20 --> 00:52:27.20
My reserve parachute came out and I was fine.

667
00:52:27.20 --> 00:52:32.20
Very mechanical, you know, very, yeah, that's just robotic.

668
00:52:32.20 --> 00:52:34.20
You know, that's how we were trained.

669
00:52:34.20 --> 00:52:35.20
That's what I got trained to do.

670
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:36.20
That's what I did.

671
00:52:36.20 --> 00:52:37.20
And do I have this right?

672
00:52:37.20 --> 00:52:39.20
You were in the back seat for this.

673
00:52:39.20 --> 00:52:40.20
Mm-hmm.

674
00:52:43.20 --> 00:52:47.20
How frustrating was that, that you were not flying the airplane?

675
00:52:47.20 --> 00:52:55.20
That sense, I mean, I don't know what it's like to be a fighter pilot, your description of going back seat at fours as part of the standard continuum to cycle up front.

676
00:52:55.20 --> 00:53:01.20
And I'm sure the guy you're with was a great guy, but that pilot in command sense of who's got the controls.

677
00:53:01.20 --> 00:53:08.20
How much of that were you thinking about in real time, that frustration of, or was there any of you not being the one flying it?

678
00:53:08.20 --> 00:53:09.20
Or you just recognizing it was going on?

679
00:53:09.20 --> 00:53:12.20
No, it didn't occur to me at all because he was a really good pilot.

680
00:53:12.20 --> 00:53:13.20
Yeah.

681
00:53:13.20 --> 00:53:16.20
And I trusted him and no problem there.

682
00:53:16.20 --> 00:53:17.20
And it all happened so fast.

683
00:53:17.20 --> 00:53:18.20
Yeah.

684
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:23.20
I mean, we're talking about second, two seconds at the most.

685
00:53:23.20 --> 00:53:24.20
Yeah.

686
00:53:24.20 --> 00:53:27.20
Dave's the single seat fighter for his whole career.

687
00:53:27.20 --> 00:53:28.20
Yeah.

688
00:53:28.20 --> 00:53:32.20
Just that sense of wanting to be the one making the airplane do what it's supposed to do.

689
00:53:32.20 --> 00:53:37.20
I just think for me, and I'm sure it was for you, that it sounded like it was much more standard.

690
00:53:37.20 --> 00:53:45.20
We never had that pipeline, but going in the back seat of an airplane, the one or two times in my career I did it, there was a small sense of, I'd really rather be up front.

691
00:53:45.20 --> 00:53:51.20
Dave Burke has this feeling, if you go over to go fly on a civilian flight with him, he's frustrated that he's not flying the civilian bird.

692
00:53:51.20 --> 00:53:57.20
Well, I can understand that, but you had to live with what it was.

693
00:53:57.20 --> 00:53:58.20
Yeah.

694
00:53:58.20 --> 00:54:12.20
And it's kind of like, in a way, some of the things you said in your previous podcast talking about when you become the boss of your peers, you sorted that out quite well.

695
00:54:12.20 --> 00:54:16.20
Well, I had to sort out not being the boss in this case.

696
00:54:16.20 --> 00:54:22.20
Now, and some of the guys I flew with, though, I had to help them fly, I think, a little bit.

697
00:54:22.20 --> 00:54:27.20
Not that they were bad pilots, they just weren't fighter pilots yet, that much.

698
00:54:27.20 --> 00:54:33.20
But some of the fighter pilots I flew with were like you, and they didn't want to give up the stick.

699
00:54:33.20 --> 00:54:37.20
And I had to almost fight them to say, give me that stick.

700
00:54:37.20 --> 00:54:50.20
You know, it's like, you know, they were upset that they had to fly with somebody else in the airplane with had a stick, you know, because they had been single-seaters so long.

701
00:54:50.20 --> 00:55:02.20
So we were friends, but, you know, one thing about me is I was always pretty able to be straightforward with people in a respectful way most of the time.

702
00:55:02.20 --> 00:55:12.20
But I scored 34 on the fast-paced, impatient side, so being able to confront people has never been a problem.

703
00:55:12.20 --> 00:55:15.20
I confronted a four-star general one time.

704
00:55:15.20 --> 00:55:20.20
I knew him, and he was a really good guy, and he said, I think we should pull this guy's wings.

705
00:55:20.20 --> 00:55:23.20
And I said, General, I don't think so. I'd be a mistake.

706
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:25.20
I said, here's A, B, and C.

707
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:39.20
And sure enough, the guy went back and flew 141s. In fact, he was the aircraft commander of the 141 that flew my War College class up to Carlisle Barracks to meet with the other War College classes, Navy, Industrial Army, and Air Force, all together.

708
00:55:39.20 --> 00:55:43.20
What the guy do that had his wings at stake?

709
00:55:43.20 --> 00:55:46.20
That's what I'm saying. He became the aircraft commander.

710
00:55:46.20 --> 00:55:48.20
But why was he in trouble?

711
00:55:48.20 --> 00:55:57.20
Oh, he was not instructor pilot. They sent him from a 141 co-pilot to be a T-38 instructor pilot.

712
00:55:57.20 --> 00:56:03.20
And he was a good pilot, but he just couldn't fly and talk at the same time, catch it all.

713
00:56:03.20 --> 00:56:08.20
And I said, he's already a trained pilot. I don't think we should take his wings and send him back.

714
00:56:08.20 --> 00:56:10.20
And he did.

715
00:56:10.20 --> 00:56:18.20
But I didn't mind confronting the front-seater if he was doing something. I was in no way. My life was at stake.

716
00:56:18.20 --> 00:56:23.20
I would tell some of those guys, roll in now. Don't roll in now.

717
00:56:23.20 --> 00:56:26.20
And one of them told me, just shut up, boy.

718
00:56:26.20 --> 00:56:28.20
I said, okay.

719
00:56:28.20 --> 00:56:30.20
He was one of the more experienced ones.

720
00:56:30.20 --> 00:56:43.20
You have to take ownership for things, and sometimes you can be wrong, but most of the times you know you're probably right.

721
00:56:43.20 --> 00:56:46.20
All right. I'm going to go back to the book here.

722
00:56:46.20 --> 00:56:52.20
Fast forward a little bit. Again, you got to get the book for the rest of these details, but I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

723
00:56:52.20 --> 00:57:01.20
The journey from the Southern Panhandle of North Vietnam to Hanoi was a long grueling ordeal. For the first few days, they moved me from Hamlet to Hamlet during the daylight.

724
00:57:01.20 --> 00:57:11.20
At night, they tied me down to boards and bomb shelters. As I contemplated what suffering might lie ahead, I found encouragement in the words of the apostle Paul.

725
00:57:11.20 --> 00:57:23.20
Quote, we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance, perseverance, character, and character, hope.

726
00:57:23.20 --> 00:57:29.20
On three occasions, American fighter jets flew in low and attacked trucks parked in the trees alongside the road.

727
00:57:29.20 --> 00:57:36.20
We took shelter in foxholes and bomb shelters and watched the fireworks, a front-row seat to the terrors of war.

728
00:57:36.20 --> 00:57:41.20
Foot-long chunks of red-hot shrapnel sometimes landed not more than six feet from me.

729
00:57:41.20 --> 00:57:48.20
The sights, sounds, and smells of the bombs and anti-aircraft artillery explosions are indelibly etched in my memory.

730
00:57:48.20 --> 00:57:53.20
War attacks the emotions in a way that's impossible to describe and difficult to erase.

731
00:57:53.20 --> 00:58:03.20
More threatening than the bombs were the attacks from angry peasants, a mob of old women and teens, furious over the destruction American pilots had wrought,

732
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:08.20
rushed toward me wielding rocks, sticks, and rice-cutting sickles.

733
00:58:08.20 --> 00:58:17.20
My young North Vietnamese escort and the guards under his authority formed a cordon and ushered me to safety, even absorbing some of the blows.

734
00:58:17.20 --> 00:58:22.20
Several times during the week-long journey north, this soldier saved my life.

735
00:58:22.20 --> 00:58:29.20
In following his orders to transport me safely, he displayed a remarkable balance of toughness and kindness not only to me,

736
00:58:29.20 --> 00:58:33.20
but also to his men and the two civilians we met along the way.

737
00:58:33.20 --> 00:58:37.20
Strong character is remarkably apparent, even in your enemy.

738
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:52.20
Again, they must have placed a huge level of value on you pilots, on capturing Americans, for this guy to do such a good job protecting you from the civilians.

739
00:58:52.20 --> 00:58:55.20
Yes, they did, but this guy was special.

740
00:58:55.20 --> 00:59:04.20
I found out because a guy who lives near where I was captured, went to the village.

741
00:59:04.20 --> 00:59:10.20
He's gotten to know a lot of the forward air controllers who flew over there, Vietnamese guy.

742
00:59:10.20 --> 00:59:21.20
He went to the village, found the person, the wife of that person that we're talking about, and he investigated a little bit about this guy.

743
00:59:21.20 --> 00:59:32.20
He stayed with the militia. He wasn't a gung-ho on the communists, and he was known for being tough and a really good man.

744
00:59:32.20 --> 00:59:42.20
And this woman, because the bombing out of the road, and the- we had a hurricane, what do they call them over there, come through?

745
00:59:42.20 --> 00:59:43.20
Typhoon.

746
00:59:43.20 --> 00:59:50.20
Typhoon came through, and we had to stay at his place for two nights, and he had moved out of his house with his wife.

747
00:59:50.20 --> 01:00:00.20
And his father, and he had dug into the sand dune right away, just up some of the beach, and they were living in a cave.

748
01:00:00.20 --> 01:00:08.20
And they took me in that cave, and I slept between his father and his two-year-old daughter, tied up, slept between them in the back of that cave.

749
01:00:08.20 --> 01:00:17.20
And at night, when it was time to eat, they saw I couldn't eat with chopsticks, and they brought me a spoon, and I had a bowl of rice.

750
01:00:17.20 --> 01:00:25.20
And they started talking to me, and they were treating me like I was a really nice fellow and just a visitor to their house.

751
01:00:25.20 --> 01:00:30.20
Even though most of the time I'm tied up in the guards or right out the front door there.

752
01:00:30.20 --> 01:00:35.20
And this guy went back and interviewed that lady, and she told him about me.

753
01:00:35.20 --> 01:00:41.20
She said she's speaking Vietnamese, but he has a video of it, and says, oh yes, I remember him.

754
01:00:41.20 --> 01:00:46.20
He was nice. He smiled, and he had eyebrows that went all the way across.

755
01:00:46.20 --> 01:00:50.20
And they did, by then, my eyebrows were solid all the way across.

756
01:00:50.20 --> 01:01:01.20
And this woman, I think she's 82 or 81 or 82, and her daughter, the one that was two years old, that slept on one side of me and his father, of course, is dead.

757
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.20
But they were wonderful people, and they treated me like I was a guest.

758
01:01:05.20 --> 01:01:10.20
And then the next day, he loaded me up and took me off to the bin to the camp up there.

759
01:01:10.20 --> 01:01:23.20
But still he protected me a couple of times on the way up to bin because the Communist Party would get a party leader in the local village would get a bullhorn out, and he'd get them all fired up.

760
01:01:23.20 --> 01:01:29.20
You know, work harder, suffer more for the Fatherland kind of thing. Look what we've done. You know, ah, ah, ah, ah.

761
01:01:29.20 --> 01:01:33.20
And he'd get them all fired up, and then they'd come after me.

762
01:01:33.20 --> 01:01:39.20
And they would get hit sometimes trying to protect me.

763
01:01:39.20 --> 01:01:43.20
And one time he had the driver of the truck who we were traveling in.

764
01:01:43.20 --> 01:01:53.20
Normally you'd travel in the back, but he had the driver drive up to the door, open the door, push me in, told the driver to drive on off through the crowd.

765
01:01:53.20 --> 01:01:56.20
And the driver's just pushing the crowd back.

766
01:01:56.20 --> 01:02:03.20
And one guy jumped up on the hood of the truck and started beating on the windshield, cussing at me, pointing at me, cussing at me.

767
01:02:03.20 --> 01:02:09.20
Cussing at me. Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah. And the driver told him to. He was in Vietnamese.

768
01:02:09.20 --> 01:02:13.20
Get off. He had his hand. Get off. Get off. Get off. The guy didn't do it.

769
01:02:13.20 --> 01:02:17.20
The driver just looked over at me and said, oh, well, you know, he started speeding up.

770
01:02:17.20 --> 01:02:22.20
And finally the guy looked over and he saw how fast he was going.

771
01:02:22.20 --> 01:02:25.20
The driver was going and he jumped off and went rolling down the hill.

772
01:02:25.20 --> 01:02:28.20
And the driver kind of looked over at me and grinned.

773
01:02:28.20 --> 01:02:43.20
It was just bizarre. My trip to Hanoi was bizarre. It's unreal that, you know, nobody, none of the POWs I know had that good, protected experience I did.

774
01:02:43.20 --> 01:02:52.20
Now, I joined up with some, with Biller and Fisher and Warner at Ben and from then on we were tied up and bouncing along in the back of the truck.

775
01:02:52.20 --> 01:02:58.20
But that was special. That was unique.

776
01:02:58.20 --> 01:03:10.20
You end up here in the book. You say, my escort deposited me at the collection prison near Vin, which was nothing more than a bamboo pole barn divided into individual cages, each with a pile of straw on the floor for sleeping.

777
01:03:10.20 --> 01:03:14.20
Ken had already arrived. So that's the first time you see Ken?

778
01:03:14.20 --> 01:03:23.20
Actually, right after I was captured, they took, yeah, the first time I saw him, we were both blindfolded. They took me to a bomb shelter right after I was captured.

779
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:32.20
And I heard this guy breathing heavily. Now Ken had been a wrestler. He was New York state wrestling champion and wrestled in college.

780
01:03:32.20 --> 01:03:36.20
And so his nose had been smashed. So when he breathed hard, you could hear him.

781
01:03:36.20 --> 01:03:44.20
And so I said, is that you can? And the guards went out, had gone outside of that bomb shelter. He said, yeah, you okay?

782
01:03:44.20 --> 01:03:52.20
I said, yeah, you okay? He said, yeah, they came right back in, dragged me out and I didn't see him again till we got to Vin.

783
01:03:52.20 --> 01:04:06.20
Lieutenant Colonel Ted Minter and first Lieutenant Jim Warner, whose Marine F-4 Phantom jet had been shot down a few weeks earlier. We're also there. We were kept isolated from each other and fed a small bowl of rice topped by a few greens twice a day.

784
01:04:06.20 --> 01:04:13.20
A day or so after my arrival, the camp commander, whom I derogatorily nicknamed Madman, summoned me for my first interrogation.

785
01:04:13.20 --> 01:04:18.20
According to the Geneva Convention, captured soldiers are required to provide name, rank, service, number, and date of birth.

786
01:04:18.20 --> 01:04:25.20
Our code of conduct says that we should resist answering other questions. When I tried to stick with these big four, Madman went berserk.

787
01:04:25.20 --> 01:04:32.20
He called me a criminal and threatened to kill me on the spot. After I still refused to answer, he shouted at command in Vietnamese.

788
01:04:32.20 --> 01:04:44.20
A nearby guard jammed his AK-47 barrel against my head and chambered around. Still in shock of capture and unsure of how POWs had actually been treated, I decided to talk a bit more.

789
01:04:44.20 --> 01:04:50.20
Spying my F-4 aircrew checklist on the table, I admitted that I had been flying the F-4 Phantom out of Da Nang.

790
01:04:50.20 --> 01:04:59.20
Madman asked me several more questions about my unit and command structure. I stalled then gave bogus answers to a couple and did not know to the rest.

791
01:04:59.20 --> 01:05:05.20
That was sufficient to end the interrogation without giving up any meaningful or accurate information other than the big four.

792
01:05:05.20 --> 01:05:17.20
The next evening, under the cover of darkness, the V, and this is your shorthand throughout the book for the Vietnamese captors you call the V, shoved the four of us into the back of a truck.

793
01:05:17.20 --> 01:05:27.20
Accompanied by several armed guards, we headed for Hanoi on a bomb crater pocked Route 1A, the primary coastal route from north to south.

794
01:05:27.20 --> 01:05:36.20
With blindfold on and hands and feet tied, we crashed up and down on the hard steel truck bed like helpless pigs going to market.

795
01:05:36.20 --> 01:05:49.20
Mark it, words cannot adequately describe the agony of that journey which was heightened by the mental anguish of knowing that every bounce brought us closer to an uncertain fate in the infamous prisons of Hanoi.

796
01:05:49.20 --> 01:06:11.20
You end up there. Our section of the Hanoi Hilton was known to POWs as Little Vegas because most Air Force fighter pilots had done some training at Nellis Air Force Base just outside Las Vegas, Nevada.

797
01:06:11.20 --> 01:06:20.20
The various wings of Little Vegas were appropriately named after some of the popular casino hotels of that era.

798
01:06:20.20 --> 01:06:25.20
The Desert Inn, Stardust, Golden Nugget, Riviera, The Mint, and Thunderbird, our cell block.

799
01:06:25.20 --> 01:06:34.20
Four men's cells were typical except for the Mint which had three and a half foot by seven foot rooms used for solitary confinement.

800
01:06:34.20 --> 01:06:44.20
Our cell in Thunderbird was six and a half feet wide and seven feet deep, about the size of a small walking closet and had masonry walls 16 inches thick.

801
01:06:44.20 --> 01:06:50.20
One wall faced the central courtyard of Little Vegas and its opposite wall fronted the main hallway.

802
01:06:50.20 --> 01:07:00.20
The side walls of our cell were separated from the walls of the neighboring cells by narrow hallways so we could not tap messages through them to other POWs.

803
01:07:00.20 --> 01:07:07.20
Camp rules tacked to the inside of our cell made it clear that anyone communicating with another cell would be severely punished.

804
01:07:07.20 --> 01:07:12.20
Armed guards constantly patrolled the halls to ensure compliance.

805
01:07:12.20 --> 01:07:22.20
The heavy door of our cell had an eight inch by ten inch peephole with a hinged cover which guards occasionally would flip open to threaten us and make sure we were behaving ourselves.

806
01:07:22.20 --> 01:07:33.20
There were four beds about 30 inches wide made from two by six boards that were bracketed too high to the walls on either side of the doorway.

807
01:07:33.20 --> 01:07:36.20
The walking space between the bunk beds measured about 18 inches.

808
01:07:36.20 --> 01:07:41.20
From the high ceiling hung a single dim light bulb that burned night and day.

809
01:07:41.20 --> 01:07:49.20
Iron leg stocks at the foot of the beds gave this dark and depressing cell the ominous feel of a medieval dragon, a medieval dungeon.

810
01:07:49.20 --> 01:08:00.20
At least three times a day, seven days a week, the V piped in propaganda through a soapbox speaker also called camp radio attached high on one wall.

811
01:08:00.20 --> 01:08:13.20
That's a rough, that's just sounds off, sounds horrible.

812
01:08:13.20 --> 01:08:16.20
What are you thinking when you get into this place?

813
01:08:16.20 --> 01:08:23.20
You know, I think you're just wondering what's going to happen next.

814
01:08:23.20 --> 01:08:32.20
And the fact that I'm with three other guys, I'm an extrovert outgoing guy.

815
01:08:32.20 --> 01:08:36.20
So that was pretty exciting to me to be with three other guys.

816
01:08:36.20 --> 01:08:39.20
And I was the youngest guy in the junior ranking guy.

817
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:42.20
So I'm thinking I'm just going to hang on, you know.

818
01:08:42.20 --> 01:08:54.20
You go on to say just before bedtime, Hanoi Hanna, the North Vietnamese version of the infamous Tokyo Rose of World War Two shared communist half truths and outright lies.

819
01:08:54.20 --> 01:09:03.20
She typically closed her broadcast each night in a sympathetic and sisterly tone by saying, G eyes, why should you die 10,000 miles from home?

820
01:09:03.20 --> 01:09:06.20
Lay down your arms now and crossover to the people side.

821
01:09:06.20 --> 01:09:15.20
The afternoon broadcast were especially disheartening because they featured Americans spouting words that could have been written for them in Hanoi or Moscow.

822
01:09:15.20 --> 01:09:23.20
Tom Hayden, founder of the socialist front organization Students for a Democratic Society was a regular speaker.

823
01:09:23.20 --> 01:09:29.20
Later in the war, the V welcomed the aid of Hayden's antiwar activist wife, film star Jane Fonda.

824
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:42.20
Isolated in that tiny cell, the four of us had plenty of time to get to know each other. Captain Fisher told us how he had endured brutal torture during his initial interrogation back at Vin to avoid answering any questions beyond the big four.

825
01:09:42.20 --> 01:09:58.20
At Madman's command, guards had tied his arms behind his back, tossed a rope over a high beam and pulled Ken's arms up behind, lifting him until he was suspended with the weight of his body pulling and tearing at the muscles, ligaments and nerves in his shoulders.

826
01:09:58.20 --> 01:10:12.20
A star collegiate wrestler at New York State High School and New York State High School champion, Ken was mentally and physically one of the toughest men I'd ever known, but eventually the pain transformed him into a screaming idiot.

827
01:10:12.20 --> 01:10:18.20
As we all learned to do so, he had to fall back to the second line of resistance.

828
01:10:18.20 --> 01:10:28.20
At times some POWs prayed for death as a relief, but the V, who were experts at torture, rarely obliged.

829
01:10:28.20 --> 01:10:40.20
Upon hearing Ken's story, I felt embarrassed and immature. He had suffered so much trying to follow the strict letter of the code while I had given in after threats and a rifle jab to the head.

830
01:10:40.20 --> 01:10:52.20
When I shared my interrogation encounter with him, he said with sincere kindness, you did the best you could under the circumstances. We ended up at the same place giving them something that was nothing.

831
01:10:52.20 --> 01:11:03.20
That experience gave me a glimpse of the character of this man who would be a cellmate and inspirational leader for the next five years.

832
01:11:03.20 --> 01:11:14.20
That little piece of leadership right there, here's this guy that withstood the description, horrible torture.

833
01:11:14.20 --> 01:11:24.20
You tell him, hey, they put a gun in my head and I told him some information. He said, yeah, you did the best you could.

834
01:11:24.20 --> 01:11:31.20
That had to have left an impact on you with him as an individual and him as a leader.

835
01:11:31.20 --> 01:11:53.20
It did. And then the next time we got tortured, it was the same thing. He went a lot longer than I did. I went a lot longer than somebody else did.

836
01:11:53.20 --> 01:12:04.20
Because Ken didn't have any experience with any of the other POWs who had been there, he was a very level headed guy and just a great leader.

837
01:12:04.20 --> 01:12:16.20
He was a really good thinker and even some of the things that he did after we came home, like one time he had two squadron commanders when women first started flying in the Air Force.

838
01:12:16.20 --> 01:12:28.20
One of them was in charge of the flying squadron, the other one in charge of the student squadron, and they weren't handling the flying squadron very appropriately with the women there.

839
01:12:28.20 --> 01:12:37.20
And so Ken realized that he needed to do something and he didn't fire them. He switched them.

840
01:12:37.20 --> 01:12:48.20
He put the guy in the student squadron in charge of the flying squadron and the guy in charge of the flying squadron in charge of the student squadron and they both did great and they both got promoted to colonel.

841
01:12:48.20 --> 01:12:57.20
And it was just a brilliant move of how he saw what the situation was and what would be the best solution.

842
01:12:57.20 --> 01:13:10.20
And I think in the POW situation, he was a great example and I didn't have the choice of being put in the ropes or being hung by the ropes like he was in that case.

843
01:13:10.20 --> 01:13:21.20
My situation was death in my case and I think he saw that. I didn't know that they wouldn't kill me, why wouldn't they?

844
01:13:21.20 --> 01:13:33.20
So I think he took all that into account in a really good way but he realized probably at that point that I probably needed to be more confident.

845
01:13:33.20 --> 01:13:46.20
And when leaders are able to help their people believe that they let them know they believe in them, they become more effective and more confident and next time they're going to come through stronger.

846
01:13:46.20 --> 01:13:58.20
So that's a really important leadership point and I've been very fortunate in my life growing up in high school, college days and in the military.

847
01:13:58.20 --> 01:14:09.20
I've had leaders that believed in me. I wouldn't be where I am today if I hadn't had leaders that believed in me and helped me become the person I am today.

848
01:14:09.20 --> 01:14:19.20
So I just think he showed me that and a great example there. And of course later he relieved Lieutenant Colonel Lecomand in that cell.

849
01:14:19.20 --> 01:14:30.20
So he was just very wise, not perfect. I remember after a few months and I finally decided, well, he's not perfect. I can forgive him for that.

850
01:14:30.20 --> 01:14:34.20
But for a while I thought he was just perfect.

851
01:14:34.20 --> 01:14:41.20
Another question we get asked a lot is how can I get this individual to step up into a leadership and start becoming a leader?

852
01:14:41.20 --> 01:14:47.20
Put them in a leadership position. When you put someone in a leadership position, you're telling them, hey, I believe you should be in this leadership position.

853
01:14:47.20 --> 01:14:55.20
I believe that you can lead. And guess what they start doing? They start acting like a leader. Most of the time occasionally you'll get someone that's not ready for you.

854
01:14:55.20 --> 01:15:04.20
They don't have the right attitude yet. But oftentimes you just take someone, a junior individual and say, hey, I want you to run this operation. I want you to run this project.

855
01:15:04.20 --> 01:15:09.20
And they see that you believe in them and that makes them believe in themselves. It's a good move.

856
01:15:09.20 --> 01:15:20.20
You know, speaking of this relief, we'll get into this because I think it's an important and bold move that happens here.

857
01:15:20.20 --> 01:15:29.20
So there's a guy named Lieutenant Colonel Minter. It's actually not his real name. It's a made up name to be gentle, I guess, with the situation.

858
01:15:29.20 --> 01:15:37.20
Well, he had five sons. And I thought that when I wrote that book, I wrote that for his sons. I didn't want to put his name there.

859
01:15:37.20 --> 01:15:44.20
Right. So Lieutenant Colonel Minter was summoned to more interrogations than the rest of us. That seemed natural at first.

860
01:15:44.20 --> 01:15:51.20
As the senior ranking officer, SRO in our room, he was potentially the highest value target for exploitation.

861
01:15:51.20 --> 01:15:57.20
But over time, we realized that Minter's views were not aligned with ours or the policy of our government.

862
01:15:57.20 --> 01:16:04.20
A soldier has the obligation to do his best to uphold the code of conduct, which includes resisting exploitation by the enemy.

863
01:16:04.20 --> 01:16:10.20
What might be acceptable for a civilian back home in our free society is totally out of line for a military person, especially a POW.

864
01:16:10.20 --> 01:16:19.20
One day, Minter came back from an interrogation with pencil and paper and began writing an extensive description of the organization responsibilities of a Marine Air Wing.

865
01:16:19.20 --> 01:16:26.20
We cautioned him that his cooperation was a violation of the code of conduct, but he said he didn't see any problem.

866
01:16:26.20 --> 01:16:37.20
Later, when he was called out of the room for an interrogation, we looked at the paper and saw that it contained information that appeared accurate and of value to the enemy, a clear breach of the code.

867
01:16:37.20 --> 01:16:47.20
Captain Fisher, as the next senior officer in the cell, told Lieutenant Warner and me that he felt compelled to remove Lieutenant Colonel Minter from command.

868
01:16:47.20 --> 01:16:55.20
He asked if we agreed. Is a very serious and risky step for a captain to relieve a Lieutenant Colonel of command?

869
01:16:55.20 --> 01:17:01.20
If competent authority did not support Ken's action, he would likely face a court martial for insubordination.

870
01:17:01.20 --> 01:17:08.20
We also risked court martial for our involvement, but we knew Ken was right, so we gave him our wholehearted support.

871
01:17:08.20 --> 01:17:15.20
When Minter returned to the room, Ken said, you're willing cooperation with the enemy in writing this paper as a violation of the code of conduct.

872
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:21.20
I am removing you from command and ordering you to destroy that document and cease cooperating with the enemy.

873
01:17:21.20 --> 01:17:26.20
If you disobey these orders, I will personally seek a court martial against you after the war.

874
01:17:26.20 --> 01:17:30.20
That's friggin' awesome.

875
01:17:30.20 --> 01:17:35.20
Minter said he did not believe the code of conduct applied in this case because we were not in a declared war.

876
01:17:35.20 --> 01:17:38.20
In his opinion, everyone was free to do as he saw fit.

877
01:17:38.20 --> 01:17:42.20
That was a shockingly irresponsible attitude for a military officer.

878
01:17:42.20 --> 01:17:46.20
Only a few months previous, he had told friends that he hoped to make general.

879
01:17:46.20 --> 01:17:54.20
Now his comments made him look like a selfish survivor who would forsake his beloved core, his friends, his roommates, and even his country to save his hide.

880
01:17:54.20 --> 01:18:03.20
That evening, Lieutenant Colonel Minter ripped up the document and threw it in the waste bucket, but his behavior over the subsequent years indicated that he never had a change of heart.

881
01:18:03.20 --> 01:18:08.20
So that's a bold move to make.

882
01:18:08.20 --> 01:18:13.20
You're more junior than the senior officer and you say, hey, you're not in charge anymore.

883
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:14.20
I am.

884
01:18:14.20 --> 01:18:19.20
And by the way, I'm in a court martial after the war if you resist this.

885
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:28.20
Yeah, it takes courage and believing, you know, it was obvious what was right.

886
01:18:28.20 --> 01:18:32.20
And there was evidence, enough evidence for him to make that decision.

887
01:18:32.20 --> 01:18:35.20
And so he courageously stood up and did it.

888
01:18:35.20 --> 01:18:37.20
And that's the kind of guy Ken was.

889
01:18:37.20 --> 01:18:44.20
So I had this courageous role model living with 24 hours a day, actually for five years.

890
01:18:44.20 --> 01:18:51.20
In fact, we've been home a couple of years and he'd only been married for two and a half years when he was captured.

891
01:18:51.20 --> 01:19:07.20
And his wife, we were his wife and him and my wife and I were at a social event and she came up and says, Lee Ellis, I want you to know I've lived him with Ken Fisher longer than you have.

892
01:19:07.20 --> 01:19:13.20
But he was a great cellmate and a real, he helped me mature.

893
01:19:13.20 --> 01:19:25.20
You know, I needed maturity in lots of different ways and watching him, learning from him helped me to grow into be the person that I needed to be.

894
01:19:25.20 --> 01:19:28.20
And so I got tougher.

895
01:19:28.20 --> 01:19:32.20
I got wiser.

896
01:19:32.20 --> 01:19:44.20
And I would say I don't know to what degree, you know, I would say this, but my own courage grew.

897
01:19:44.20 --> 01:19:54.20
I thought I was pretty courageous, but I think it, I gained courage because I knew what I wanted to do.

898
01:19:54.20 --> 01:20:01.20
I wanted to live up to the code of conduct and be a good American and be faithful to my teammates, do my job.

899
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:04.20
And so I was willing to take risks.

900
01:20:04.20 --> 01:20:05.20
I was a pretty good risk taker.

901
01:20:05.20 --> 01:20:07.20
I'm in the camp.

902
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:15.20
I was found it easy to take risks in communicating and things like that because I know I'm good at it.

903
01:20:15.20 --> 01:20:18.20
So I figured I can do it and get away with it.

904
01:20:18.20 --> 01:20:30.20
So they brought this three-page biography questionnaire for us to fill out and we filled it out and put name, rank, service number, date of birth, except for a mentor who filled it in.

905
01:20:30.20 --> 01:20:35.20
And then they hauled the other three of us out to interrogate and threaten us.

906
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:45.20
It was funny because they had a new interrogator there and he came in and he would say, I don't want to hurt you.

907
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:47.20
I don't want to bother you, but you're a good person.

908
01:20:47.20 --> 01:20:49.20
You should do this and it'll be all right.

909
01:20:49.20 --> 01:20:52.20
You know, he was a nice guy.

910
01:20:52.20 --> 01:20:53.20
Okay.

911
01:20:53.20 --> 01:20:55.20
And then we say no.

912
01:20:55.20 --> 01:20:57.20
And then the bad guy comes in.

913
01:20:57.20 --> 01:20:59.20
We're going to torture you.

914
01:20:59.20 --> 01:21:03.20
We'll go back and forth for an hour or two and then we didn't fill it in.

915
01:21:03.20 --> 01:21:17.20
So then they put us in handcuffs and tied our feet and put us on our knees up against the wall with our hands over our head, which, you know, no big problem.

916
01:21:17.20 --> 01:21:24.20
But after six or eight hours, you start falling over and then they start coming in and start kicking you and beating you.

917
01:21:24.20 --> 01:21:31.20
And you get back up and after six or eight more hours, you've been up and down and been kicked and beaten and all this.

918
01:21:31.20 --> 01:21:41.20
So finally, after, I don't know, the next day, probably 36 hours, I decided, well, I'm going to give in.

919
01:21:41.20 --> 01:21:43.20
I'm going to give them something.

920
01:21:43.20 --> 01:21:45.20
Ain't going to be nothing, but I'm going to.

921
01:21:45.20 --> 01:21:47.20
And so I told them I would do it.

922
01:21:47.20 --> 01:21:54.20
I filled in the three pages and everything on it was a lie except for my dad's first and last name.

923
01:21:54.20 --> 01:22:02.20
And everything else was just made up, you know, education, money, what everything was just totally made up.

924
01:22:02.20 --> 01:22:09.20
Well, I get back to the room and I wasn't the first one back, but after a while.

925
01:22:09.20 --> 01:22:16.20
But when I did that, when I did that, when I agreed to do it, I laid there and cried.

926
01:22:16.20 --> 01:22:20.20
I was so sad because I was not tough enough to beat him.

927
01:22:20.20 --> 01:22:21.20
I felt so ashamed.

928
01:22:21.20 --> 01:22:29.20
I felt like the most worthless piece of crap that I ever wanted to uniform because I wasn't able to beat him.

929
01:22:29.20 --> 01:22:33.20
My duty was to beat him and I couldn't beat him.

930
01:22:33.20 --> 01:22:43.20
Now, I didn't give him anything, but the fact that I'd filled it in, that was the first time I'd ever really come to grips with the reality that at some point,

931
01:22:43.20 --> 01:22:48.20
you know, you got to fall back to a second round.

932
01:22:48.20 --> 01:22:56.20
Now, when they put the gun to my head earlier, I had, but that was a little different than just being tortured and being painful, uncomfortable,

933
01:22:56.20 --> 01:22:59.20
and being beaten and kicked and all that.

934
01:22:59.20 --> 01:23:02.20
And then when you got back to it, how did Ken Fisher do?

935
01:23:02.20 --> 01:23:09.20
Well, he came back to and he said he had done the same thing, but he was 54 hours longer than me.

936
01:23:09.20 --> 01:23:12.20
He survived, so he was tougher than me.

937
01:23:12.20 --> 01:23:18.20
I'm laughing because that's like, you know, in the SEAL teams, you know, everyone's always competing with everybody else.

938
01:23:18.20 --> 01:23:22.20
And here you guys are competing to see who could take horrible torture longer.

939
01:23:22.20 --> 01:23:23.20
Exactly.

940
01:23:23.20 --> 01:23:34.20
And so as quick as we got communication, though, we found out that everybody had been through it and done the same thing.

941
01:23:34.20 --> 01:23:36.20
Everybody had filled out that biography.

942
01:23:36.20 --> 01:23:40.20
So then I thought, well, I guess I'm not quite as worthless as I thought.

943
01:23:40.20 --> 01:23:42.20
But Ken was good about it, too.

944
01:23:42.20 --> 01:23:49.20
Again, he helped me understand that he didn't go much longer than I did and he had done it, too.

945
01:23:49.20 --> 01:23:51.20
But we didn't give him any information.

946
01:23:51.20 --> 01:23:52.20
Yeah.

947
01:23:55.20 --> 01:24:03.20
Given a little bit more about your life there, for the first two years, the feeling of hunger never left us.

948
01:24:03.20 --> 01:24:09.20
Food was the most popular topic of conversation, especially when it was cold and our bodies needed more calories just to stay warm.

949
01:24:09.20 --> 01:24:16.20
Upon awakening in the winter months, I would realize I'd been dreaming about walking down a cafeteria line, selecting a breakfast of eggs,

950
01:24:16.20 --> 01:24:19.20
bacon, sausage, toast, orange juice, and coffee.

951
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:26.20
But in reality, our typical meal was a bowl of thin, greasy vegetable soup accompanied by either a cup of rice or an 8-inch baguette of bread.

952
01:24:26.20 --> 01:24:28.20
We joked that the menu had lots of variety.

953
01:24:28.20 --> 01:24:30.20
It changed three times a year.

954
01:24:30.20 --> 01:24:38.20
Since the V cooked outside in big pots, small bugs and white worms would regularly drop into the soup from overhanging trees.

955
01:24:38.20 --> 01:24:44.20
Every August, weevils would hatch in the flour so the bread would be peppered with black buggers.

956
01:24:44.20 --> 01:24:50.20
Having nothing better to do one afternoon, I counted 44 and one cubic inch of bread.

957
01:24:50.20 --> 01:24:56.20
There were too many to pick out, so we just ate them, figuring they were a good source of protein.

958
01:24:56.20 --> 01:25:00.20
Winters in Hanoi were surprisingly cold, with temperatures off into the low 40s.

959
01:25:00.20 --> 01:25:02.20
Fahrenheit sometimes lower.

960
01:25:02.20 --> 01:25:09.20
The chilly air blowing in through our barred open window, covered only with a raton mat, made our unheated cell feel like an ice box.

961
01:25:09.20 --> 01:25:15.20
It was also cold because our meagre rations provided insufficient energy to stay warm through the long nights.

962
01:25:15.20 --> 01:25:22.20
We survived by putting every bit of clothing we owned, two pairs of thin pajamas and a cotton sweater, and wrapping ourselves in our blanket.

963
01:25:22.20 --> 01:25:32.20
For the first two years, we had no socks, so our feet never got warm in the winter.

964
01:25:32.20 --> 01:25:36.20
The POW experience produced severe mental and emotional stress.

965
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:41.20
Hour after hour, we found ourselves battling an army of oppressive feelings.

966
01:25:41.20 --> 01:25:51.20
From fear about what might happen to us, to anger at our captors for the way they treated us to disappointment for being shot down, to guilt for leaving our families in the lurch and in the dark.

967
01:25:51.20 --> 01:25:55.20
Maintaining a positive mental outlook was crucial to survival.

968
01:25:55.20 --> 01:26:02.20
Military leaders expect life to be difficult, yet they tend to be optimistic about their ability to succeed.

969
01:26:02.20 --> 01:26:11.20
They are trained to make the best of the situation by solving problems instead of stewing about them, and they place a high value on cohesive teamwork.

970
01:26:11.20 --> 01:26:14.20
Fortunately, that's the kind of leadership we had in Hanoi.

971
01:26:14.20 --> 01:26:22.20
A few of our buddies who had more pessimistic temperaments occasionally needed extra measures of encouragement from the rest of us.

972
01:26:22.20 --> 01:26:30.20
In return, they frequently contributed a healthy dose of realism that balanced our optimism with objectivity and discipline.

973
01:26:30.20 --> 01:26:41.20
Vice Admiral James Bond Stockdale insightfully captured the importance of this dynamic tension in what Jim Collins called the Stockdale Paradox.

974
01:26:41.20 --> 01:26:59.20
You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end, which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.

975
01:26:59.20 --> 01:27:15.20
Yeah, that's just a critical way of thinking, right? Having the positive mindset that we can overcome whatever this challenge is, but not being Pollyanna and saying, oh yeah, we'll be fine.

976
01:27:15.20 --> 01:27:20.20
No, there's going to be struggles and we have to face our reality for what it is.

977
01:27:20.20 --> 01:27:23.20
Yeah, I think so. It was very, very important.

978
01:27:23.20 --> 01:27:35.20
You know, I remember, I was shot down November 67. In early 68, I said, you know, there's going to be an Olympics in Mexico City this summer.

979
01:27:35.20 --> 01:27:42.20
We'll be home because I knew that President Johnson really would have to do something with the war to get reelected.

980
01:27:42.20 --> 01:27:45.20
That was my thinking. I didn't know it, but that was my thinking.

981
01:27:45.20 --> 01:27:51.20
I said they will end this war and we'll be home by the summer. I'm going to go to Mexico City and go to the Olympics.

982
01:27:51.20 --> 01:27:57.20
Well, July comes and I moved to Sante and I'm still there.

983
01:27:57.20 --> 01:28:03.20
And they said, well, I've made it seven months. I can make it for another year.

984
01:28:03.20 --> 01:28:13.20
Well, that was one more year. The summer of 69. I said, I can make it two more years, but it was really three, three and a half.

985
01:28:13.20 --> 01:28:21.20
So, you know, the POWs, it became our way of life.

986
01:28:21.20 --> 01:28:30.20
And the fact that we had great leadership, the fact that we did get communication, we communicated covertly,

987
01:28:30.20 --> 01:28:37.20
but we were able to fight as a team, was a common enemy, and to care about each other and look after each other,

988
01:28:37.20 --> 01:28:44.20
we would risk our lives to get to somebody and say, man, we're proud of you. Hang in there. We're leaving without you.

989
01:28:44.20 --> 01:28:56.20
So it was just the leadership, the teamwork and the commitment of our leaders that they got tortured all the time.

990
01:28:56.20 --> 01:29:04.20
And they would do things much worse than we were doing, actually, but they would bounce right back and come back because they did the best they could.

991
01:29:04.20 --> 01:29:10.20
And they bounced back and they put out good policies and they lived by them.

992
01:29:10.20 --> 01:29:22.20
It was an amazing experience. That's why I wrote that book, because I think it's just the principles that we learned and lived by there are good everywhere, you know?

993
01:29:22.20 --> 01:29:24.20
Yeah. No doubt about it.

994
01:29:24.20 --> 01:29:37.20
And here's the thing about it. You couldn't hide, you couldn't pretend because somebody was going to be watching you 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

995
01:29:37.20 --> 01:29:43.20
There was no way you could hide anything, so you just confessed it all up front.

996
01:29:43.20 --> 01:30:03.20
And I think there's a pride piece in confessing, coming back to the cell and saying, I did feel like that three-page biography, but I didn't tell them anything honest, nothing real, no true facts except for my dad's name.

997
01:30:03.20 --> 01:30:11.20
But it was still painful at times. But I think we realized that that was a way of life.

998
01:30:11.20 --> 01:30:15.20
Yeah, there's you capture some of that in here.

999
01:30:15.20 --> 01:30:24.20
You say, when you are at the mercy of an enemy who has the power to force you to do things against your will, the psychological impact can be unimaginably depressing and debilitating.

1000
01:30:24.20 --> 01:30:29.20
His goal is to break you and you must constantly fight to maintain your self-respect and optimism.

1001
01:30:29.20 --> 01:30:31.20
Most of us did this in two primary ways.

1002
01:30:31.20 --> 01:30:38.20
First, we fought to maintain our belief in ourselves and our competency by resisting the enemy and exercising our autonomy at every opportunity.

1003
01:30:38.20 --> 01:30:47.20
In order to demonstrate that our lives still had worth and we were not just helpless, we had to find ways to get our licks in, often using tricks and subtle acts of rebellions as weapons.

1004
01:30:47.20 --> 01:30:49.20
Subtle acts of rebellions as weapons.

1005
01:30:49.20 --> 01:30:59.20
Every time a POW outsmarted the V, no matter how trivial the incident, the other POWs were encouraged and emboldened.

1006
01:30:59.20 --> 01:31:09.20
And I really like that idea, you know, in the modern era of working out, of lifting weights and doing workouts.

1007
01:31:09.20 --> 01:31:16.20
They have something they call scalable workouts, meaning, oh, we're going to do a weightlifting exercise.

1008
01:31:16.20 --> 01:31:24.20
If we're going to deadlift and I can deadlift 300 and you can deadlift 500, we both do the workout, but I'm just lifting less weight than you.

1009
01:31:24.20 --> 01:31:27.20
But we're still both going to go and do our best.

1010
01:31:27.20 --> 01:31:38.20
And I wrote down here a note that said scaled victories because anything that you could do to just get a shot at the V was like a victory that you all could celebrate.

1011
01:31:38.20 --> 01:31:40.20
And that's so good for morale.

1012
01:31:40.20 --> 01:31:52.20
And the fact that you've got all kinds of jokes in here, you guys would fill out information and it would be the Lieutenant Clark Kent was the person you talk about.

1013
01:31:52.20 --> 01:32:00.20
Just all these like jokes that you that you would play or every time someone would sneeze or there's a guy that would sneeze that would sneeze.

1014
01:32:00.20 --> 01:32:03.20
You know, every one of his sneeze would be her shit.

1015
01:32:03.20 --> 01:32:05.20
Yeah, you know, everyone would hear it.

1016
01:32:05.20 --> 01:32:06.20
All you guys would hear it.

1017
01:32:06.20 --> 01:32:12.20
There's a guy that had to talk about the talk when they talk about Ho Chi Minh, they call him horseshit.

1018
01:32:12.20 --> 01:32:16.20
You know, so Lieutenant Paul Galante.

1019
01:32:16.20 --> 01:32:22.20
You know, he's he's in this he's getting forced to take a picture a propaganda picture.

1020
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:27.20
And in the picture, you can see he's he's got his middle fingers up on both hands.

1021
01:32:27.20 --> 01:32:37.20
And I've got this at some point in my life, I'm going to get all these well, certain black and white photos that mean a lot to me hung up.

1022
01:32:37.20 --> 01:32:41.20
And that's one of those photos I'm going to put up there is just you can see him.

1023
01:32:41.20 --> 01:32:43.20
It says neat and clean.

1024
01:32:43.20 --> 01:32:48.20
I don't know why they have that word up there, but they have neat and clean above him on the wall.

1025
01:32:48.20 --> 01:32:55.20
And he's sitting there and he's having his photograph taken and you look at his hands and he's flipping off the camera.

1026
01:32:55.20 --> 01:33:09.20
Both fingers and those little victories, little scaled victories that you guys had to to keep the positive attitude, even when things are horrible.

1027
01:33:09.20 --> 01:33:24.20
Yeah, you have to you have to find a way to fight back and keep doing fighting back in that way gave us some victories and made us feel like well, you know, they may be in control, but we're still controlled some things.

1028
01:33:24.20 --> 01:33:28.20
And that they've made everybody feel good.

1029
01:33:28.20 --> 01:33:32.20
It made the individual feel good and it just became a way of life.

1030
01:33:32.20 --> 01:33:36.20
We're going to look for ways to make them look bad and us look good.

1031
01:33:36.20 --> 01:33:38.20
You know, they're the enemy.

1032
01:33:38.20 --> 01:33:41.20
You were able to do it a lot.

1033
01:33:41.20 --> 01:33:53.20
You know, in the book, after you talk about that, that torture that you went through for the document, you go in there and you talk about John McCain.

1034
01:33:53.20 --> 01:33:58.20
And, you know, just powerful story about John McCain.

1035
01:33:58.20 --> 01:34:04.20
And at one point, you know, they're trying to get him, you know, his dad's an admiral, they're trying to use him as a propaganda piece.

1036
01:34:04.20 --> 01:34:11.20
They're torturing him, but not only they're torturing him, what even might be more effective is they're saying, hey, you can go home early.

1037
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:13.20
They're saying, hey, you should go home.

1038
01:34:13.20 --> 01:34:16.20
They tell him that the president's telling him to go home.

1039
01:34:16.20 --> 01:34:19.20
They're just trying to get him to break ranks.

1040
01:34:19.20 --> 01:34:20.20
Right.

1041
01:34:20.20 --> 01:34:29.20
And at one point he he's like answering as loud as he can so that everyone can hear.

1042
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:31.20
He's saying, I'm not going home.

1043
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:32.20
I'm not going home.

1044
01:34:32.20 --> 01:34:34.20
It's tilting to my turn.

1045
01:34:34.20 --> 01:34:36.20
How impactful was that for you guys to hear?

1046
01:34:36.20 --> 01:34:45.20
Well, it was huge because, you know, when to think about going home when you're a POW, I mean, that's a hard place to be put in.

1047
01:34:45.20 --> 01:34:48.20
You know, he's wife and kids back home.

1048
01:34:48.20 --> 01:34:50.20
His father was an admiral.

1049
01:34:50.20 --> 01:34:52.20
He had been had broke arm.

1050
01:34:52.20 --> 01:34:55.20
Both arms were broken when he was captured when he jumped out of the airplane.

1051
01:34:55.20 --> 01:34:58.20
The injury from the ejection was so bad.

1052
01:34:58.20 --> 01:35:02.20
He couldn't even feed himself, so he had been through a lot of suffering.

1053
01:35:02.20 --> 01:35:13.20
But for him to yell out, you know, it was a it was a double whammy because in one way he's saying to the guys, I'm with you guys.

1054
01:35:13.20 --> 01:35:19.20
And the other way he was saying to the enemy, I ain't going to do what you want me to do.

1055
01:35:19.20 --> 01:35:23.20
So it was a double whammy and it was very powerful, very powerful.

1056
01:35:23.20 --> 01:35:28.20
And, you know, he was always kind of a quick thinker to make trouble.

1057
01:35:28.20 --> 01:35:30.20
That was part of his reputation.

1058
01:35:30.20 --> 01:35:33.20
Doesn't he like last at the Naval Academy in his class or something like this?

1059
01:35:33.20 --> 01:35:35.20
And I was reading his story.

1060
01:35:35.20 --> 01:35:39.20
It's being written right now, his first marriage about that story and all.

1061
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:43.20
And he was always kind of a wild and woolly guy, you know.

1062
01:35:43.20 --> 01:35:45.20
So he played that role there.

1063
01:35:45.20 --> 01:35:50.20
He was courageous but also willing to take some risk.

1064
01:35:50.20 --> 01:35:56.20
Yeah, there's something about the guys that are going to go fight in war.

1065
01:35:56.20 --> 01:36:08.20
And there's a decent chance that if you want to dedicate your life to going and fighting wars, there's a decent chance you might not be the best follower of rules.

1066
01:36:08.20 --> 01:36:10.20
You know, that's just the way it is.

1067
01:36:10.20 --> 01:36:19.20
You might be a little bit, have a tendency, you know, I talk about the SEAL teams, like there's a, there's like a criminal element to your brain for a lot of guys.

1068
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:22.20
And the SEAL teams just say, hey, what do you want to do?

1069
01:36:22.20 --> 01:36:23.20
What do you want to do when you grow up?

1070
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:26.20
I want to go and shoot machine guns at people.

1071
01:36:26.20 --> 01:36:28.20
That's not a normal thing to be thinking.

1072
01:36:28.20 --> 01:36:32.20
So you got these guys, you got, you know, it's like a good attack dog, right?

1073
01:36:32.20 --> 01:36:35.20
A good attack dog you don't want as a family dog, right?

1074
01:36:35.20 --> 01:36:38.20
You don't want to attack dog in your house.

1075
01:36:38.20 --> 01:36:41.20
You want them on the battlefield, but you don't want them in your house.

1076
01:36:41.20 --> 01:36:43.20
So you don't want them in your neighborhood.

1077
01:36:43.20 --> 01:36:46.20
You can have them really, really well trained.

1078
01:36:46.20 --> 01:36:49.20
Then you can have one in your house, maybe, but you're still going to watch it.

1079
01:36:49.20 --> 01:37:03.20
So, you know, if you get a guy like McCain, who's the last in his class at the Naval Academy and, you know, has a reputation for kind of causing problems, that's exactly the kind of guy you want in these cases.

1080
01:37:03.20 --> 01:37:04.20
Yeah.

1081
01:37:04.20 --> 01:37:15.20
It was, we needed all different kinds of people there, but we were all similar in a lot of ways because you can't go through flight school, you know, physically, mentally, go through all the, you know,

1082
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:25.20
go through all the requirements of flight school, go through the training and then become a fighter pilot without having something similar to the other people.

1083
01:37:25.20 --> 01:37:30.20
In fact, there's a book I have, I brought with me today.

1084
01:37:30.20 --> 01:37:37.20
I wish I showed you that, but there are five categories of similarities between fighter pilots.

1085
01:37:37.20 --> 01:37:43.20
And one of them is that they are, they're very aggressive and risk takers, but they're also affiliative.

1086
01:37:43.20 --> 01:37:48.20
They like to be around people so they can tell their war stories to, you know.

1087
01:37:48.20 --> 01:38:01.20
And so it made a good team, the fact that we were team players, but we were also capable of operating on our own and being confident about going and executing a mission.

1088
01:38:01.20 --> 01:38:04.20
I think that was consistent.

1089
01:38:04.20 --> 01:38:10.20
Our guys were willing to take risk and yet they wanted to be together and take care of each other.

1090
01:38:10.20 --> 01:38:15.20
It didn't, it wasn't okay to be not concerned about your teammates.

1091
01:38:15.20 --> 01:38:21.20
Yeah, I know it's, when people ask me what makes a good seal, it's a very easy answer to give.

1092
01:38:21.20 --> 01:38:25.20
It's the one that's going to take care of his team and put the team ahead of himself.

1093
01:38:25.20 --> 01:38:28.20
That's a good seal.

1094
01:38:28.20 --> 01:38:37.20
You give a really crazy and horrific description of, who is it?

1095
01:38:37.20 --> 01:38:41.20
Reisner, Lieutenant Colonel Robbie Reisner.

1096
01:38:41.20 --> 01:38:50.20
And he had like a picture, a picture of his family or something and they, the V wanted it to use it for propaganda.

1097
01:38:50.20 --> 01:38:57.20
He ripped it up and threw it in the bottom of the, of the, of the shit can that you had in the cell.

1098
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:01.20
And so they are, they want to get this picture.

1099
01:39:01.20 --> 01:39:02.20
So they torture him.

1100
01:39:02.20 --> 01:39:03.20
Here you go.

1101
01:39:03.20 --> 01:39:08.20
They offered to force him to produce the photos that guards severely beat Robbie and put him through rope torture.

1102
01:39:08.20 --> 01:39:14.20
The ropes or pretzels, as it was sometimes called, was a terrifying and brutal method for breaking POWs.

1103
01:39:14.20 --> 01:39:22.20
After the prisoners legs were tied together, his arms were laced tightly behind his back until the elbows touched and the shoulders were virtually pulled out of joint.

1104
01:39:22.20 --> 01:39:29.20
Then the torture would push the bound arms up and over the head while applying pressure with a knee to the victim's back.

1105
01:39:29.20 --> 01:39:37.20
During torture, the circulation is cut off and the limbs go to sleep, but the joint pain continues to increase as the ligaments and muscles tear.

1106
01:39:37.20 --> 01:39:43.20
When the ropes are finally removed, circulation surges back into the dead limbs causing excruciating pain.

1107
01:39:43.20 --> 01:39:57.20
When the V eventually learned what Reisner had done with the photos, they furiously inflicted more torture upon Robbie until he agreed to sign a confession and an apology for committing, quote, grave crimes.

1108
01:39:57.20 --> 01:40:02.20
Under such severe torture, no POW could resist signing these four statements.

1109
01:40:02.20 --> 01:40:12.20
We took some comfort in the fact that they invariably sounded phony because they were dictated by the V using awkward sentence structure and expressions that no American would use.

1110
01:40:12.20 --> 01:40:15.20
Sometimes they were so ridiculous that they made the V look foolish.

1111
01:40:15.20 --> 01:40:22.20
After torture, the guards boarded up the window in Reisner's cell, making it so dark that he couldn't see the walls.

1112
01:40:22.20 --> 01:40:26.20
Robbie had never been afraid of the dark, but he immediately began to have panic attacks.

1113
01:40:26.20 --> 01:40:29.20
In later describing this episode, he said,

1114
01:40:45.20 --> 01:40:48.20
Reisner's only relief was to keep moving and praying.

1115
01:40:48.20 --> 01:40:55.20
He would walk around his cell, often covering as many as 20 miles a day, and do push-ups and sit-ups until he was exhausted enough to fall asleep.

1116
01:40:55.20 --> 01:41:01.20
If he awakened during the night, he had to resume exercising until he was again exhausted enough to sleep.

1117
01:41:01.20 --> 01:41:03.20
It was a maddening existence.

1118
01:41:03.20 --> 01:41:17.20
At times he wanted to scream, but since that would bring more torture, he would hide under his mosquito net, stuff something in his mouth, wrap his blanket around his head, and just holler until the anxiety eased.

1119
01:41:17.20 --> 01:41:22.20
Often he had to talk himself into making it through one more minute and then one more minute.

1120
01:41:22.20 --> 01:41:27.20
As he put it, quote, I literally lived one minute at a time.

1121
01:41:27.20 --> 01:41:32.20
After ten months of darkness, the night finally passed.

1122
01:41:32.20 --> 01:41:39.20
In June 1968, the V removed Robbie into the Golden Nugget section of Little Vegas.

1123
01:41:39.20 --> 01:41:45.20
From our cell about 40 feet away, we heard him moaning and screaming in nightmares throughout the first night.

1124
01:41:45.20 --> 01:41:52.20
The next day when Robbie's shutters were opened, I saw his tired but smiling face for the first time.

1125
01:41:52.20 --> 01:41:57.20
During siesta, while the guards were generally less alert, Reisner and I made contact.

1126
01:41:57.20 --> 01:42:05.20
Over the next few days, he shared his story in basic guidance by writing with his index finger on his open palm one letter of the alphabet at a time.

1127
01:42:05.20 --> 01:42:09.20
It was clear that he had a lot of fight left in him.

1128
01:42:09.20 --> 01:42:15.20
His courage served as an inspiration for the rest of us in the months and years ahead.

1129
01:42:19.20 --> 01:42:27.20
I mean, solitary confinement is one thing, but solitary confinement in complete darkness for ten months.

1130
01:42:27.20 --> 01:42:30.20
Three hundred days.

1131
01:42:30.20 --> 01:42:34.20
And the first time you see him, he's got a smile on his face.

1132
01:42:34.20 --> 01:42:42.20
He looked like an old, old man. He was forty-four or so by that time, but he looked in his sixties.

1133
01:42:42.20 --> 01:42:50.20
He was so wrinkled and pitiful looking, but he smiled and I could tell he was exercising.

1134
01:42:50.20 --> 01:42:56.20
And it was just amazing, you know. He was positive.

1135
01:42:56.20 --> 01:43:05.20
You know, I use, when I'm speaking, I use three of our senior leaders, Reisner, Stockdale and Denton as an example.

1136
01:43:05.20 --> 01:43:13.20
And they were all different personalities. Stockdale was a very introverted, results mission focused guy, stoic.

1137
01:43:13.20 --> 01:43:17.20
Denton was a very outgoing politician kind of guy.

1138
01:43:17.20 --> 01:43:20.20
And Reisner had some of both.

1139
01:43:20.20 --> 01:43:26.20
He was, you know, kind of a mixture of that 20% of the population had some of both.

1140
01:43:26.20 --> 01:43:29.20
But Reisner was just an incredible guy.

1141
01:43:29.20 --> 01:43:39.20
He was so honest and he was the senior ranking officer there, except for when we had some three colonels captured in late 1967,

1142
01:43:39.20 --> 01:43:42.20
but they kept them isolated from us.

1143
01:43:42.20 --> 01:43:45.20
So Reisner was the acting commander of all.

1144
01:43:45.20 --> 01:43:49.20
Denton was, I mean, Stockdale was a senior naval officer.

1145
01:43:49.20 --> 01:43:56.20
But these three guys, they supported each other and they just provided a great example.

1146
01:43:56.20 --> 01:44:05.20
Reisner had incredible ability to bounce back and be positive and do the shameful things he did,

1147
01:44:05.20 --> 01:44:13.20
like take all that torture and then write that confession or whatever it was and then bounce back again.

1148
01:44:13.20 --> 01:44:22.20
And part of it, you know, when you talked about this, taking ownership when you do something

1149
01:44:22.20 --> 01:44:26.20
and the fact that you say, hey, look, this is what I went through and this is what I did.

1150
01:44:26.20 --> 01:44:29.20
And the fact that everyone just kind of was honest with each other.

1151
01:44:29.20 --> 01:44:35.20
You know, I've always told people when you take ownership of something, it's like overcoming an obstacle.

1152
01:44:35.20 --> 01:44:37.20
But once you get on the other side, you feel so much better.

1153
01:44:37.20 --> 01:44:39.20
You know, you get caught in a lie.

1154
01:44:39.20 --> 01:44:40.20
You're making something up.

1155
01:44:40.20 --> 01:44:42.20
You're not telling your parents the truth.

1156
01:44:42.20 --> 01:44:44.20
You're not telling your team the truth about what's going on.

1157
01:44:44.20 --> 01:44:47.20
You feel that heavy burden.

1158
01:44:47.20 --> 01:44:49.20
And the minute you say, hey, listen, everybody, I got to talk to you.

1159
01:44:49.20 --> 01:44:52.20
The plan that I came up with, it's not working and we need to change it.

1160
01:44:52.20 --> 01:44:55.20
Like, it's so liberating to do that.

1161
01:44:55.20 --> 01:45:02.20
And, you know, I often talk about, you know, if you want to get through some trauma that you've been through,

1162
01:45:02.20 --> 01:45:05.20
you got to own it and say, hey, this is what I did.

1163
01:45:05.20 --> 01:45:09.20
Here's what I think I should have done, you know, when you're in combat, things happen in combat.

1164
01:45:09.20 --> 01:45:12.20
You know, a lot of veterans suffer from this.

1165
01:45:12.20 --> 01:45:15.20
You're in combat, things don't go the way you want them to go.

1166
01:45:15.20 --> 01:45:19.20
And you look at it and say, hey, this is what I think I could have done better.

1167
01:45:19.20 --> 01:45:21.20
I should have made this move.

1168
01:45:21.20 --> 01:45:24.20
I should have moved left instead of right or right instead of left or whatever the case may be.

1169
01:45:24.20 --> 01:45:32.20
That, I think, helps you get through these things and it seems like that helps so many people in the camp,

1170
01:45:32.20 --> 01:45:37.20
both when it's happening, right after it happens, and then, you know, I'm sure we'll talk about it,

1171
01:45:37.20 --> 01:45:39.20
the way that you all came back.

1172
01:45:39.20 --> 01:45:43.20
I talked about it with Charlie Plum and William Reader as well.

1173
01:45:43.20 --> 01:45:51.20
Psychologically, for the absolute hell you all had lived through, psychologically, you were actually,

1174
01:45:51.20 --> 01:45:56.20
you actually were, did great in comparison.

1175
01:45:56.20 --> 01:46:03.20
And I think a lot of that, in my assessment as I look at it now, had to do with the fact that you all took ownership of what you did.

1176
01:46:03.20 --> 01:46:06.20
You took ownership of your limitations, right?

1177
01:46:06.20 --> 01:46:09.20
Hey, I can only take so much of this and I signed that paper.

1178
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:17.20
You know, I think it really did help us to be okay with ourselves.

1179
01:46:17.20 --> 01:46:22.20
It gave us actually more confidence in the long run of dealing with things.

1180
01:46:22.20 --> 01:46:28.20
And the other thing that happened was the fact that we lived together, you couldn't hide things, you know.

1181
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:31.20
People are going to see you.

1182
01:46:31.20 --> 01:46:34.20
You can, it's going to come out.

1183
01:46:34.20 --> 01:46:43.20
And so we knew that and so therefore it just, we lived totally transparently, completely transparently with each other.

1184
01:46:43.20 --> 01:46:49.20
And so it was just, that made us really so much stronger and healthier.

1185
01:46:49.20 --> 01:46:56.20
It increased our teamwork and our trust for each other because if something went bad, we knew we'd find out right away.

1186
01:46:56.20 --> 01:47:05.20
And of course then being locked up like that, and we could talk about this later, but I want to make sure to mention it now,

1187
01:47:05.20 --> 01:47:14.20
is that because of what the wives and families did back home, they got our torture stopped in late 69 and early 70.

1188
01:47:14.20 --> 01:47:18.20
It changed the policy of the U.S. government, changed the policy of the communist government.

1189
01:47:18.20 --> 01:47:22.20
And so everybody in the world was putting pressure on them about our treatment.

1190
01:47:22.20 --> 01:47:31.20
And so when Ho Chi Minh died in September 69, as soon as they quit celebrating his funeral and the new leaders came in,

1191
01:47:31.20 --> 01:47:35.20
they started rearranging the treatment.

1192
01:47:35.20 --> 01:47:41.20
And so the last three years we were there, it was more live and let live.

1193
01:47:41.20 --> 01:47:49.20
And we had time to decompress and get over our trauma with people who had been through worse than we had.

1194
01:47:49.20 --> 01:47:56.20
So I'm feeling bad about what I went through, but you've been here two years longer and you were tortured with the ropes three times,

1195
01:47:56.20 --> 01:47:59.20
and I didn't go through the ropes.

1196
01:47:59.20 --> 01:48:02.20
And now I can't feel bad about what has happened to me.

1197
01:48:02.20 --> 01:48:04.20
I've got to feel bad about what happened to you.

1198
01:48:04.20 --> 01:48:12.20
And we got so much healthier that POW PTSD is like 4%.

1199
01:48:12.20 --> 01:48:24.20
POW PTSD is much lower than combat veterans because we had people to talk through who had been through worse than we had for years,

1200
01:48:24.20 --> 01:48:27.20
locked up with them 24 hours a day.

1201
01:48:27.20 --> 01:48:35.20
Say we didn't just get on the airplane and come home and your buddies died over here today and tomorrow you fly back home and you're having dinner with your family.

1202
01:48:35.20 --> 01:48:41.20
And you're thinking about the trauma that we had a totally different situation.

1203
01:48:41.20 --> 01:48:50.20
So we came home very, very healthy and because of that and because of many other things we did while we were there.

1204
01:48:50.20 --> 01:48:53.20
You talk about Reisner here.

1205
01:48:53.20 --> 01:48:58.20
You say Reisner's first camp, first in his camp SRO did not last long.

1206
01:48:58.20 --> 01:49:03.20
The V found a written note that contained his guidance and connected it back to him, determined to squelch his leadership in the camps.

1207
01:49:03.20 --> 01:49:11.20
They pulled Reisner out of the zoo camp in Hanoi and returned him to Heartbreak Hotel in the Hanoi Hilton and began extensive torture to break him.

1208
01:49:11.20 --> 01:49:15.20
Because the process for selecting SRO leaders was clearly established,

1209
01:49:15.20 --> 01:49:20.20
Commander Jerry Denton, the next ranking officer at the zoo immediately stepped into the line of fire.

1210
01:49:20.20 --> 01:49:28.20
As part of the dramatic change in treatment in the fall of 1965, the V were now torturing men to extract propaganda statements.

1211
01:49:28.20 --> 01:49:33.20
Denton reaffirmed Reisner's policy and added no writing, no taping.

1212
01:49:33.20 --> 01:49:39.20
Take torture until you're in danger of losing mental faculties and then give a phony story.

1213
01:49:39.20 --> 01:49:42.20
Die before giving classified information.

1214
01:49:42.20 --> 01:49:44.20
If broken, don't despair.

1215
01:49:44.20 --> 01:49:47.20
Bounce back as soon as you can to the hard line.

1216
01:49:47.20 --> 01:49:50.20
Remember, unity above self.

1217
01:49:50.20 --> 01:49:56.20
Denton's simple motto of unity above self provided a strong cultural bond for all of us.

1218
01:49:56.20 --> 01:49:59.20
Even when we were isolated or shuffled from one camp to another.

1219
01:49:59.20 --> 01:50:06.20
When Denton's strong leadership became evident to the V, they ushered him off to the torture chamber, followed by solitary confinement.

1220
01:50:06.20 --> 01:50:09.20
Fortunately, James Bond came to the rescue.

1221
01:50:09.20 --> 01:50:12.20
James Bond's Stockdale, that is.

1222
01:50:12.20 --> 01:50:16.20
Bouncing back from one of his extended periods of abuse and solitary confinement,

1223
01:50:16.20 --> 01:50:22.20
he took command from his cell in Little Vegas, Thunderbird cell block in the spring of 1967.

1224
01:50:22.20 --> 01:50:33.20
One of his first tasks was to update the policies previously disseminated by Reisner and Denton using the clever acronym, back us.

1225
01:50:33.20 --> 01:50:37.20
And so here you go through the acronym, back us.

1226
01:50:37.20 --> 01:50:38.20
B, bowing.

1227
01:50:38.20 --> 01:50:41.20
Resist bowing in public in front of outsiders.

1228
01:50:41.20 --> 01:50:43.20
Make the V use force.

1229
01:50:43.20 --> 01:50:46.20
And this is because the Vietnamese, that was a show of respect.

1230
01:50:46.20 --> 01:50:47.20
So we're not doing it.

1231
01:50:47.20 --> 01:50:48.20
Air.

1232
01:50:48.20 --> 01:50:49.20
A, air.

1233
01:50:49.20 --> 01:50:50.20
Stay off the air.

1234
01:50:50.20 --> 01:50:54.20
Make no recordings for radio and no tapes.

1235
01:50:54.20 --> 01:50:55.20
C, crimes.

1236
01:50:55.20 --> 01:50:57.20
Don't admit to any crimes.

1237
01:50:57.20 --> 01:50:58.20
K, kiss.

1238
01:50:58.20 --> 01:51:01.20
Don't kiss the enemy goodbye.

1239
01:51:01.20 --> 01:51:06.20
If POWs were released, Stockdale did not want them to be overly generous in their comments on the way out.

1240
01:51:06.20 --> 01:51:09.20
And the last is, is us.

1241
01:51:09.20 --> 01:51:11.20
Unity over self.

1242
01:51:11.20 --> 01:51:12.20
Stay united.

1243
01:51:12.20 --> 01:51:14.20
Take care of each other.

1244
01:51:14.20 --> 01:51:26.20
The big three, Reisner, Stockdale and Denton established the code of conduct as the goal while recognizing that not even the toughest men had been able to live up to a purely literal interpretation.

1245
01:51:26.20 --> 01:51:29.20
Over time, a somewhat loose, tight culture evolved.

1246
01:51:29.20 --> 01:51:41.20
It provided strong, clear guidelines yet allowed each cell SRO and even each individual to exercise some judgment in dealing with various situations.

1247
01:51:41.20 --> 01:51:57.20
These goals and expectations empowered a common cultural mindset that allowed us to operate with unity across half a dozen camps over a period of several years, whether we were in solitary confinement or locked in large cells.

1248
01:51:57.20 --> 01:52:04.20
When there was disagreement about local interpretation, we had discussions that sometimes turned into passionate arguments before decisions were made.

1249
01:52:04.20 --> 01:52:11.20
When necessary, SROs changed or adapted policies as a result of lessons learned.

1250
01:52:11.20 --> 01:52:17.20
So this is just a, you know, I, one of the laws of combat that Dave and I talk about a lot.

1251
01:52:17.20 --> 01:52:18.20
It's an extreme owners.

1252
01:52:18.20 --> 01:52:31.20
It's all we talk about all the time is decentralized command and this, this decentralized command where this solid guidance came out and it allowed everybody in prison camps in 12 different camps.

1253
01:52:31.20 --> 01:52:41.20
The frontline person may not communicate with anybody for extended periods of time, but they understand what the goal is and they can all move in the right direction towards that strategic goal.

1254
01:52:41.20 --> 01:52:44.20
And they even know there's flexibility in that, in the way that they get there.

1255
01:52:44.20 --> 01:52:46.20
This is a very powerful lesson here.

1256
01:52:46.20 --> 01:52:48.20
Yeah, it is.

1257
01:52:48.20 --> 01:52:58.20
You know, the new chief of staff of the Air Force is pushing that right now is to set the boundaries, the big picture boundaries and let people at the lower levels operate.

1258
01:52:58.20 --> 01:53:05.20
And I think he sees that, but yes, it was powerful for us because communication was hard.

1259
01:53:05.20 --> 01:53:06.20
We were separated.

1260
01:53:06.20 --> 01:53:08.20
We were moved different places, different camps.

1261
01:53:08.20 --> 01:53:17.20
They were always, they'd pull out some people in one camp and move them to another camp and for various, you know, anytime you have a bureaucracy, they make decisions up there.

1262
01:53:17.20 --> 01:53:19.20
The communists were the same.

1263
01:53:19.20 --> 01:53:22.20
We can never could figure out some of their moves.

1264
01:53:22.20 --> 01:53:34.20
But the reality was that we understood what our mission was, what our goals were, and what the, the, the few boundaries and rules that we needed.

1265
01:53:34.20 --> 01:53:37.20
And within that, we're going to go for it.

1266
01:53:37.20 --> 01:53:45.20
Yeah, good example that is you talking here about receiving care packages, which you were occasionally allowed to receive these care packages.

1267
01:53:45.20 --> 01:53:47.20
Was that from your families are sending in care?

1268
01:53:47.20 --> 01:53:48.20
Yeah, they weren't care.

1269
01:53:48.20 --> 01:53:50.20
They were like packages from family.

1270
01:53:50.20 --> 01:54:01.20
So your first one that you get, you know, you had to apply this, these principles, because in it, you had to make you in order to get the package.

1271
01:54:01.20 --> 01:54:07.20
And this package is like, I mean, heaven sent for all practical purposes.

1272
01:54:07.20 --> 01:54:12.20
It could have food, it could have clothes, it could have, I mean, just not to mention communication from your loved ones.

1273
01:54:12.20 --> 01:54:17.20
And yet they wanted you to sign something, some kind of confession.

1274
01:54:17.20 --> 01:54:26.20
It was basically a paper, a little one pager that said in accordance with their lenient humane policy.

1275
01:54:26.20 --> 01:54:28.20
And that was too much for you too much.

1276
01:54:28.20 --> 01:54:31.20
And so you decided don't don't want the package.

1277
01:54:31.20 --> 01:54:36.20
And the next time another package came and they actually removed that statement.

1278
01:54:36.20 --> 01:54:37.20
No more statements.

1279
01:54:37.20 --> 01:54:39.20
Never had one again.

1280
01:54:39.20 --> 01:54:41.20
And you got you took your package.

1281
01:54:41.20 --> 01:54:42.20
Yep.

1282
01:54:42.20 --> 01:54:44.20
What was in the package?

1283
01:54:44.20 --> 01:54:51.20
Let's see, there was some coffee and there was some candy and there was some socks.

1284
01:54:51.20 --> 01:54:52.20
Nice.

1285
01:54:52.20 --> 01:54:53.20
That's what I wanted.

1286
01:54:53.20 --> 01:54:56.20
Some socks, maybe a piece of fruit cake.

1287
01:54:56.20 --> 01:54:58.20
Just little things like that.

1288
01:54:58.20 --> 01:55:05.20
I was on deployment and, you know, my wife, my wife's at home with three kids.

1289
01:55:05.20 --> 01:55:07.20
They're all under the age of like six.

1290
01:55:07.20 --> 01:55:09.20
So it's like six, four and two.

1291
01:55:09.20 --> 01:55:11.20
I mean, she's just overwhelmed.

1292
01:55:11.20 --> 01:55:13.20
And so she's not worried about me.

1293
01:55:13.20 --> 01:55:14.20
Like she got bigger.

1294
01:55:14.20 --> 01:55:16.20
They got bigger problems to solve on a daily basis.

1295
01:55:16.20 --> 01:55:21.20
And, you know, guys in the platoons are getting their packages from their wives and from their

1296
01:55:21.20 --> 01:55:24.20
parents and stuff, you know, big, nice, beautiful packages.

1297
01:55:24.20 --> 01:55:30.20
Finally, like three months into deployment, I get a package from my wife.

1298
01:55:30.20 --> 01:55:33.20
It's got, I like honey roasted peanuts.

1299
01:55:33.20 --> 01:55:40.20
And so there's a little can of honey roasted peanuts, but they'd already been opened.

1300
01:55:40.20 --> 01:55:43.20
They had half eaten and they were taped back shut.

1301
01:55:43.20 --> 01:55:44.20
And I was like, God bless her.

1302
01:55:44.20 --> 01:55:46.20
She's doing the best she can.

1303
01:55:46.20 --> 01:55:49.20
You know, she's one of the kids got into it or whatever.

1304
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:51.20
So she said, I'll throw some tape on it.

1305
01:55:51.20 --> 01:55:53.20
We'll be all right.

1306
01:55:53.20 --> 01:55:54.20
Yeah.

1307
01:55:54.20 --> 01:55:56.20
You got to give them credit.

1308
01:55:56.20 --> 01:55:57.20
Oh, a hundred percent.

1309
01:55:57.20 --> 01:55:58.20
Yeah.

1310
01:55:58.20 --> 01:56:04.20
Like I said, I, she was dealing with three little kids and not, not worried about, definitely

1311
01:56:04.20 --> 01:56:07.20
not worried about me.

1312
01:56:07.20 --> 01:56:14.20
We talked a little bit about communication and the importance of communication and the

1313
01:56:14.20 --> 01:56:15.20
communication.

1314
01:56:15.20 --> 01:56:19.20
I mean, we're, we're, we're sitting here talking about it, you know, about you, they're putting

1315
01:56:19.20 --> 01:56:24.20
out word and, and how the information you knew this person and respected this person and

1316
01:56:24.20 --> 01:56:26.20
you got guidance and all these things are happening.

1317
01:56:26.20 --> 01:56:33.20
This is all happening in the most restrictive imaginable communication environment.

1318
01:56:33.20 --> 01:56:35.20
And so I'm going to go to the book here.

1319
01:56:35.20 --> 01:56:41.20
It would be safe to say that in the early, early years and small cells, 50% of our waking

1320
01:56:41.20 --> 01:56:44.20
hours were spent in covert communications.

1321
01:56:44.20 --> 01:56:47.20
Later in larger cells, fewer people were needed.

1322
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:51.20
And with our newer technologies and a less threatening environment, communications were

1323
01:56:51.20 --> 01:56:52.20
much more efficient.

1324
01:56:52.20 --> 01:56:59.20
Over the years, we use tap code, hand code, flash code, Morris code, cough, hack, spit

1325
01:56:59.20 --> 01:57:04.20
code, sweeping code, voices through the walls, notes over the walls, notes under the door,

1326
01:57:04.20 --> 01:57:09.20
notes under the doors and more because they knew it was our primary tool for resistance,

1327
01:57:09.20 --> 01:57:17.20
the V tried hard to stop us, but they never could because of our poor treatment.

1328
01:57:17.20 --> 01:57:19.20
Now I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1329
01:57:19.20 --> 01:57:23.20
So you had all these different methodologies for communicating.

1330
01:57:23.20 --> 01:57:27.20
And the fact that you, you, you, you mentioned this in here.

1331
01:57:27.20 --> 01:57:33.20
You got this tap code, the, the matrix, the five, five, five by five matrix, which is a

1332
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:35.20
way of communicating.

1333
01:57:35.20 --> 01:57:41.20
And when I was a young seal, I was a radio man and we had to learn Morris code.

1334
01:57:41.20 --> 01:57:48.20
And I was probably pretty close to the point where I could kind of do it without thinking

1335
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:51.20
about it, but I never quite got there.

1336
01:57:51.20 --> 01:57:55.20
But you know, you're talking in the book at, at some point you could just do it.

1337
01:57:55.20 --> 01:57:59.20
I mean, it was like, without thinking the letter A was just, you could immediately just get

1338
01:57:59.20 --> 01:58:00.20
it done.

1339
01:58:00.20 --> 01:58:04.20
And there's a whole group of you that could, that could communicate on this high level

1340
01:58:04.20 --> 01:58:05.20
with these tap codes.

1341
01:58:05.20 --> 01:58:08.20
And that's how all this information was passed.

1342
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:10.20
It's just an incredible story.

1343
01:58:10.20 --> 01:58:16.20
And that tap code tapping through to somebody on the other side of the wall, especially in

1344
01:58:16.20 --> 01:58:20.20
the early years where there were a couple of guys in solitary confinement and had gone

1345
01:58:20.20 --> 01:58:28.20
through torsional, it was like, it was the most incredible thing to keep them motivated,

1346
01:58:28.20 --> 01:58:34.20
inspired, connected, emotionally, mentally going.

1347
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:43.20
And you know, in fact, one guy was in solitary confinement and he wanted to know about, he

1348
01:58:43.20 --> 01:58:46.20
wanted, he wanted to know about Shakespeare.

1349
01:58:46.20 --> 01:58:49.20
So some guys next to him knew of some Shakespeare stuff.

1350
01:58:49.20 --> 01:58:54.20
And, and they got them all the through, gave them all they could remember.

1351
01:58:54.20 --> 01:58:57.20
And then they just made it up because they didn't want to tell him.

1352
01:58:57.20 --> 01:58:58.20
We don't know anymore.

1353
01:58:58.20 --> 01:59:04.20
So whatever it was, we were going to share it and make it interesting.

1354
01:59:04.20 --> 01:59:09.20
Guys would share all sorts of information.

1355
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:15.20
I remember I, at times, you know, you, you're in a cell with four or five guys, like I was

1356
01:59:15.20 --> 01:59:16.20
out at Sante.

1357
01:59:16.20 --> 01:59:19.20
And so you know them, you've been locked up with them for a while.

1358
01:59:19.20 --> 01:59:22.20
And so you get off on your own project.

1359
01:59:22.20 --> 01:59:30.20
So one time I farmed for two months and there was a farmer from Kansas living next door,

1360
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:32.20
Leroy Stutz.

1361
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:37.20
And so I got, whenever I needed a question answered about farming, I wasn't quite sure

1362
01:59:37.20 --> 01:59:38.20
about it.

1363
01:59:38.20 --> 01:59:43.20
I'd ask, through the wall, I would ask Leroy and he would tell me what a, how many feet

1364
01:59:43.20 --> 01:59:46.20
of barb wire went a roll of barb wire.

1365
01:59:46.20 --> 01:59:47.20
Okay.

1366
01:59:47.20 --> 01:59:50.20
And how much a roll of barb wire normally costs.

1367
01:59:50.20 --> 01:59:52.20
And I'd go back and calculate.

1368
01:59:52.20 --> 01:59:56.20
So I was fencing in 120 acres of farm there that day.

1369
01:59:56.20 --> 02:00:00.20
So you go through doing all these kind of things.

1370
02:00:00.20 --> 02:00:03.20
And one time, another time I was going to be a lawyer when I went home.

1371
02:00:03.20 --> 02:00:07.20
I was just decided, okay, what if I wanted to do something different?

1372
02:00:07.20 --> 02:00:08.20
I'd be a lawyer.

1373
02:00:08.20 --> 02:00:09.20
And it took me a month.

1374
02:00:09.20 --> 02:00:12.20
And I mean, I would think for this for hours every day.

1375
02:00:12.20 --> 02:00:15.20
So I had to find out more about different kinds of laws.

1376
02:00:15.20 --> 02:00:17.20
So I'd ask the guy's question.

1377
02:00:17.20 --> 02:00:23.20
I decided I'd be a tax lawyer and I go to the University of Virginia.

1378
02:00:23.20 --> 02:00:25.20
And all this was done through tap.

1379
02:00:25.20 --> 02:00:28.20
But some of this was going back, you know, I was finding a lot, so much with tap code.

1380
02:00:28.20 --> 02:00:33.20
And then we wrote up the blankets and we could talk to it because a blanket would be a muffler,

1381
02:00:33.20 --> 02:00:36.20
like a little donut or like a horse collar.

1382
02:00:36.20 --> 02:00:40.20
Put your face in it real tight and you could talk real loud and they couldn't hear you out there.

1383
02:00:40.20 --> 02:00:44.20
And the guy on the other side could hear you, everything you said.

1384
02:00:44.20 --> 02:00:53.20
And I would ask questions that way so I could get information to, you know, work on my project.

1385
02:00:53.20 --> 02:00:59.20
Speaking of the tap code, you say, because of poor treatment, Smitty Harris and Fred Flam,

1386
02:00:59.20 --> 02:01:05.20
first lieutenant USAF, were fighting losing battles with the bilitating gastrointestinal disease.

1387
02:01:05.20 --> 02:01:10.20
Through a crack in our door, we watched Smitty and Fred stagger across the courtyard to the bath house.

1388
02:01:10.20 --> 02:01:15.20
Their emaciated bodies reminiscent of survivors of Auschwitz and Baton.

1389
02:01:15.20 --> 02:01:19.20
Smitty's POW weight had dwindled from 130 pounds to about 90.

1390
02:01:19.20 --> 02:01:24.20
Fred had dropped from 140 down to about 110.

1391
02:01:24.20 --> 02:01:31.20
Sante SRO Lieutenant Commander Render Creighton realized it would take drastic action to save the lives of these men.

1392
02:01:31.20 --> 02:01:36.20
Using the tap code, he sent an urgent message that was transmitted across the entire compound.

1393
02:01:36.20 --> 02:01:42.20
Tell every English-speaking Vietnamese you meet, that the camp commander must do something for Harris and Flam,

1394
02:01:42.20 --> 02:01:51.20
or his superiors in Hanoi are going to be very upset with him about what is going to happen in this camp.

1395
02:01:51.20 --> 02:01:55.20
By threatening to make trouble, we were virtually inviting reprisal.

1396
02:01:55.20 --> 02:02:01.20
This ploy was especially risky because it revealed that we had a cohesive team with good communications.

1397
02:02:01.20 --> 02:02:09.20
Once the enemy realized we were organized as a military unit with a functioning operational leader, they just might try to break us.

1398
02:02:09.20 --> 02:02:13.20
Nevertheless, the seriousness of the situation justified the risk.

1399
02:02:13.20 --> 02:02:18.20
The next day, POWs across the camp delivered the bold, agreed-upon message in rapid fire succession.

1400
02:02:18.20 --> 02:02:22.20
If only one or two guards had received the message, the V would have downplayed it.

1401
02:02:22.20 --> 02:02:28.20
But our overcommunication resounded across the camp like a string of firecrackers that couldn't be ignored.

1402
02:02:28.20 --> 02:02:35.20
Evidently, the V Camp Commander, a fearful footer's job, was convinced we had the will and capability to carry out our threat.

1403
02:02:35.20 --> 02:02:42.20
Three days after the message hit, Smitty and Fred were taken to a field hospital a few miles away and given fluoroscope.

1404
02:02:42.20 --> 02:02:46.20
This was followed by two shots twice daily that were apparently vitamins and antibiotics.

1405
02:02:46.20 --> 02:02:48.20
Their improvement was slow, but steady.

1406
02:02:48.20 --> 02:02:51.20
A year later, they were back to their normal POW weight.

1407
02:02:51.20 --> 02:03:04.20
It's superbly fitting that the code that was instrumental in saving Smitty and Harris's life, because Smitty was the man who saved all of us by bringing the TAP code to the POW camps.

1408
02:03:04.20 --> 02:03:07.20
In fact, he was known to us as the Code Bearer.

1409
02:03:07.20 --> 02:03:15.20
When Smitty was in survival school, he alone stayed after class one day to learn about the code used by POWs in World War II.

1410
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:21.20
Then as one of the first POWs in the war, he passed this precious gift onto his fellow prisoners.

1411
02:03:21.20 --> 02:03:28.20
Now, four years later, the code had come full circle and saved his life.

1412
02:03:28.20 --> 02:03:29.20
Amazing.

1413
02:03:29.20 --> 02:03:37.20
And the first time you got like the little bit of the code someone's telling you through your window, but you didn't get the missing letter.

1414
02:03:37.20 --> 02:03:39.20
The missing letter, that C and K, there's no K.

1415
02:03:39.20 --> 02:03:43.20
It's just five by five, 25 letters in the alphabet you remove K.

1416
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:45.20
Yeah.

1417
02:03:45.20 --> 02:03:47.20
You know, Smitty's 93.

1418
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:49.20
He'll be 94 next April.

1419
02:03:49.20 --> 02:03:51.20
He was a POW for almost eight years.

1420
02:03:51.20 --> 02:03:54.20
I think he was number five or six.

1421
02:03:54.20 --> 02:04:01.20
And his wife had two little girls, five and three, I think, and she was six months pregnant with their son.

1422
02:04:01.20 --> 02:04:03.20
But incredible guy.

1423
02:04:03.20 --> 02:04:10.20
I lived with Smitty for a couple of years and in the same camp with him for probably close to five years.

1424
02:04:10.20 --> 02:04:15.20
But we stayed real close friends and he has a book out, Tap Code, that came out three years ago.

1425
02:04:15.20 --> 02:04:25.20
And I wrote the foreword to it to talk about Smitty and what a great guy he was and what a great example he was for me.

1426
02:04:25.20 --> 02:04:36.20
You mentioned the being at Sante for a while and that's how we originally got connected because I had Terry Butler on who is a Sante raider.

1427
02:04:36.20 --> 02:04:41.20
And he's the one that connected with me with you.

1428
02:04:41.20 --> 02:04:48.20
How, when the Sante raid happened, how did you guys hear about it?

1429
02:04:48.20 --> 02:04:49.20
What did it do to you guys?

1430
02:04:49.20 --> 02:04:51.20
What did you think about it?

1431
02:04:51.20 --> 02:04:59.20
Well, we were, we had moved to this new show place camp because they wanted to show the world how well we're being treated.

1432
02:04:59.20 --> 02:05:00.20
And we heard the bombs going off.

1433
02:05:00.20 --> 02:05:04.20
There was a bomb attack to kind of distract attention.

1434
02:05:04.20 --> 02:05:07.20
And some, we knew something was happening that night.

1435
02:05:07.20 --> 02:05:17.20
And then the next day we could tell about the guards, the way they were acting and the turn keys and guards were like, uh, and then the next morning we moved back to Hanoi.

1436
02:05:17.20 --> 02:05:26.20
They load this all up and they built this camp and put 205, four quadrants of about 50 each in one camp.

1437
02:05:26.20 --> 02:05:30.20
We're in separate quadrants, but we're all in one location.

1438
02:05:30.20 --> 02:05:44.20
So there's 205 of us there and they 48 hours, then 48 hours, they moved all of us back to Hanoi and put us into the cell, the large rooms cells where the Vietnamese had been back for the early years.

1439
02:05:44.20 --> 02:05:46.20
We had never been in there.

1440
02:05:46.20 --> 02:05:54.20
And so we went into these big cells and one of this 1800 square foot cell with 52 guys in there.

1441
02:05:54.20 --> 02:05:55.20
No walls in there.

1442
02:05:55.20 --> 02:05:59.20
Just 1800 open Bay barracks type thing.

1443
02:05:59.20 --> 02:06:02.20
Concrete slab to sleep on, but back to Santé.

1444
02:06:02.20 --> 02:06:08.20
Uh, and hearing it, hearing it, uh, that night we heard it from a show place camp.

1445
02:06:08.20 --> 02:06:10.20
We didn't know what was happening.

1446
02:06:10.20 --> 02:06:26.20
And then because they got scared and moved us back, we started listening and one of the guys, uh, heard on their propaganda, something about that Barry Goldwater had said that we could drop a.

1447
02:06:26.20 --> 02:06:32.20
Men in downtown Hanoi or something like that, and they couldn't stop us or something.

1448
02:06:32.20 --> 02:06:34.20
And that sounded strange.

1449
02:06:34.20 --> 02:06:41.20
And then the next time we really found out was when some of the guys, uh, you shoot down told us.

1450
02:06:41.20 --> 02:06:47.20
And that was a while later, maybe about a year later that we really found out for sure what had happened.

1451
02:06:47.20 --> 02:06:54.20
How exalting was it to be in a room with 50 other people and have all these other people to interact with?

1452
02:06:54.20 --> 02:07:15.20
Well, it was, uh, it was a celebration because we had, I mean, there were some hard parts to it, but they, the good things over overwhelmed the difficult parts because within a couple of weeks, the senior ranking officer looked around and found the one guy who had been a college instructor in the client in the group.

1453
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:22.20
He'd been recalled on active duty in 1962 and stayed in the Air Force and captain Tom story.

1454
02:07:22.20 --> 02:07:28.20
He said, Tom, I'm putting you in charge of the education program. I want to make it happen.

1455
02:07:28.20 --> 02:07:47.20
Tom found a piece of broken brick tile out in the yard, brought it in and went over on the concrete slab floor over in the corner and started writing down subjects that study math, German, French, Spanish, Russian art and had us go by and put a mark under the ones we want to study.

1456
02:07:47.20 --> 02:08:01.20
So he took a survey and then he recruited teachers. And so within three or four weeks, we had Monday, Wednesday, Friday classes, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday classes, three hours in the morning, two hours in the afternoon.

1457
02:08:01.20 --> 02:08:14.20
We had toastmasters informal on Tuesday nights on one end of the room, formal on Thursday nights. And we had every kind of class you can think of.

1458
02:08:14.20 --> 02:08:31.20
I was studying Spanish, French and German, teaching beginning French. I took differential calculus from a Naval Academy guy and we were writing problems over in the corner with that piece of broken brick tile and he was teaching me.

1459
02:08:31.20 --> 02:08:43.20
So I mean, we got busy, man. We were so busy. You talk about Paul Galani. Paul Galani and I were in there together and we would speak Spanish, French and German for 10 minutes each.

1460
02:08:43.20 --> 02:09:00.20
For four days a week. We got to the point where we were dreaming in foreign languages. I'd be speaking Spanish to somebody in a foreign language. I didn't have a conversation with them in my dream.

1461
02:09:00.20 --> 02:09:04.20
So that's what our life became.

1462
02:09:04.20 --> 02:09:14.20
Yeah, the amount of effort that you guys made in the section here, you say a number of officers developed a rigorous curriculum and volunteered to teach you the various components of the course.

1463
02:09:14.20 --> 02:09:26.20
This was that you wanted to teach an officer candidate school for the three Air Force enlisted guys. So you guys put together a course of instruction for these enlisted Air Force guys.

1464
02:09:26.20 --> 02:09:34.20
And you say this when the three men returned home, the US Congress approved the program and offered the candidates commissions as second lieutenants in the US Air Force.

1465
02:09:34.20 --> 02:09:41.20
One was so close to retirement, he declined. The other two men accepted their commissions and enjoyed successful careers.

1466
02:09:41.20 --> 02:09:47.20
Unbelievable. You go on to say the lack of books or outside resources did not limit our continuous learning in the POW camps.

1467
02:09:47.20 --> 02:09:56.20
We relied on recall past education and there was a lack of clarity. When there was a lack of clarity on the subject, we tried to get a consensus of the best minds.

1468
02:09:56.20 --> 02:10:05.20
Eventually, many areas were quantified into what we called Hanoi fact, meaning it was accepted as true until we were released and could verify the information.

1469
02:10:05.20 --> 02:10:13.20
The in-house joke was that some men whose education had been slighted before capture and now proudly posed as experts had been totally educated by Hanoi fact.

1470
02:10:13.20 --> 02:10:21.20
Fortunately, it turned out our facts were amazingly accurate. Our investment in developing and development has paid big dividends in a year since.

1471
02:10:21.20 --> 02:10:27.20
I can't believe they took guys just so. Yep. Yeah, you guys learned. We're going to give you guys your commission. Incredible.

1472
02:10:27.20 --> 02:10:41.20
Yep. And you know, similar in the same group, I think it was a group like them. If not the same group, there were four of them, four or five of them were married and about seven or eight of them were bachelors.

1473
02:10:41.20 --> 02:10:48.20
And so the married guys did marriage counseling two days a week. They would teach a marriage course to the single guys.

1474
02:10:48.20 --> 02:10:55.20
And one of the single guys said, well, some of what they said was true, but some of it was probably not the best in the world.

1475
02:10:55.20 --> 02:11:02.20
But you know, they were listening. They were trying to learn about what it's like to be married when we go home.

1476
02:11:02.20 --> 02:11:08.20
I want to go back to the code of conduct here again or to back to the book here. Talk about the code of conduct.

1477
02:11:08.20 --> 02:11:13.20
You say, we found that the code of conduct had to be interpreted in light of specific circumstances.

1478
02:11:13.20 --> 02:11:22.20
How long a person should resist under torture before completing a biography or agreeing to read the propaganda news into a tape recorder to be played over camp radio?

1479
02:11:22.20 --> 02:11:29.20
Under what conditions should we try and escape? How much torture should someone take to avoid meeting with a peace delegation?

1480
02:11:29.20 --> 02:11:39.20
These were not hypothetical issues that a detached executive made in a remote top floor corner office would address for implementation by the rank and file.

1481
02:11:39.20 --> 02:11:46.20
In the POW camps, the decision makers knew they were likely to be the first to follow their own guidance.

1482
02:11:46.20 --> 02:11:53.20
Reisner, Stockdale and Denton made it clear that we were to refuse to participate in propaganda broadcasts.

1483
02:11:53.20 --> 02:12:00.20
But under extreme torture, it was impossible to totally resist. As we learn from the experience of several men who did not come home,

1484
02:12:00.20 --> 02:12:08.20
at some point, mind, body and spirit break, causing loss of rational, coherent thought and the ability to effectively function.

1485
02:12:08.20 --> 02:12:16.20
Therefore, Reisner further clarified this policy by adding that we should quote, take torture indefinitely,

1486
02:12:16.20 --> 02:12:24.20
but stop short of losing life or limb or mental faculties by falling back to a second line of defense.

1487
02:12:24.20 --> 02:12:33.20
Having been pushed beyond his endurance several times, he knew that sometimes temporary submission was the only way to preserve the ability to fight.

1488
02:12:33.20 --> 02:12:44.20
Because some POWs were simply tougher mentally and physically than others, local RSOs had the freedom to interpret resistance policies to suit the circumstances.

1489
02:12:44.20 --> 02:12:47.20
Major Larry Guarino, am I saying that right?

1490
02:12:47.20 --> 02:12:48.20
Guarino.

1491
02:12:48.20 --> 02:12:53.20
Guarino, who heroically stood up to some of the worst treatment during the darkest days of the zoo camp,

1492
02:12:53.20 --> 02:13:00.20
demonstrated wise discernment about how to effectively balance accomplishment of mission and care for the men.

1493
02:13:00.20 --> 02:13:03.20
He said there are wide differences in people.

1494
02:13:03.20 --> 02:13:13.20
A very few men, like Jim Kassler, a major U.S. Air Force, have the stamina and courage to stick to a hard line during severe punishment and continue to hold out.

1495
02:13:13.20 --> 02:13:20.20
Most men, although they want to do a good job, will gamely resist the cruelties, but not for very long.

1496
02:13:20.20 --> 02:13:29.20
Although our leaders were often tortured first and most, they did not pretend to be macho John Wayne heroes.

1497
02:13:29.20 --> 02:13:34.20
On the contrary, they openly shared the pain and despair of their brokenness,

1498
02:13:34.20 --> 02:13:41.20
helping us understand the enemy's tactics and the realities of what was and what was not possible.

1499
02:13:41.20 --> 02:13:50.20
It would have been disastrous for the mission and for their credibility had they been less than totally honest with us about their experiences in the torture chambers.

1500
02:13:50.20 --> 02:14:00.20
Mutual accountability and transparency in the face of a cruel enemy bonded us together tightly.

1501
02:14:00.20 --> 02:14:07.20
An analysis conducted after the war by headquarters U.S. Air Force reflects the sacrifices and commitment made to achieve the mission.

1502
02:14:07.20 --> 02:14:12.20
Nine faithful warriors died before they could return with honor.

1503
02:14:12.20 --> 02:14:20.20
We lost eight brave men due to extreme torture and deprivation in the earlier years and one died of typhoid fever.

1504
02:14:20.20 --> 02:14:24.20
More than 95% of the POWs were tortured.

1505
02:14:24.20 --> 02:14:29.20
Approximately 40% of POWs were in solitary confinement more than six months.

1506
02:14:29.20 --> 02:14:32.20
20% were in solitary for more than a year.

1507
02:14:32.20 --> 02:14:41.20
10% were in solitary for more than two years and several were in solitary more than four years.

1508
02:14:41.20 --> 02:14:47.20
Considering the length of stay in the crowded conditions, our survival record was remarkable.

1509
02:14:47.20 --> 02:14:55.20
Most of us made it back and our mental and emotional state exceeded the predictions of most of the mental health professionals advising the DOD.

1510
02:14:55.20 --> 02:15:03.20
The overall determination and devotion of this group to our mission was impressive.

1511
02:15:03.20 --> 02:15:13.20
Of the nearly 500 POWs in our network, fewer than 10 only 2% willingly cooperated with the enemy.

1512
02:15:13.20 --> 02:15:22.20
And it's again from a leadership perspective, all this leadership was done tapping on walls and setting examples.

1513
02:15:22.20 --> 02:15:27.20
It's just like it's from a leadership perspective is incredible story.

1514
02:15:27.20 --> 02:15:33.20
Well, when you don't have a lot of news and no radio and no TV, you don't get a lot of news.

1515
02:15:33.20 --> 02:15:40.20
And what you get is usually focused on what's happening, how we're resisting.

1516
02:15:40.20 --> 02:15:44.20
And that becomes the headlines.

1517
02:15:44.20 --> 02:15:47.20
And you know where you are.

1518
02:15:47.20 --> 02:15:49.20
You know what's going to happen.

1519
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:56.20
And you've just got to be able to face up to it and walk that line one step at a time.

1520
02:15:56.20 --> 02:16:14.20
I think that was, every day was an unknown and yet somehow we had to step out every day and be ready for whatever came our way and respond to it in a way that was honorable, that was courageous,

1521
02:16:14.20 --> 02:16:21.20
that we would be willing to stand up to our boss and say, here's what I did and here's why I did it.

1522
02:16:21.20 --> 02:16:36.20
And the amazing thing about this situation, I think one that made it so strong was that the bosses got tortured the most and they had to stand up and say, here's what I did and here's why and here's what happened.

1523
02:16:36.20 --> 02:16:48.20
So the fact that our bosses were so vulnerable, they're very courageous and very tough, but they were vulnerable about sharing what they had been through and what they had done.

1524
02:16:48.20 --> 02:16:56.20
It set an example and it created a culture that was very special.

1525
02:16:56.20 --> 02:17:10.20
Speaking of leadership and you know, as I as we've gone through this book, this is a book about leadership and and a book about, you know, what the human being can come up against.

1526
02:17:10.20 --> 02:17:12.20
But it's absolutely a leadership book.

1527
02:17:12.20 --> 02:17:18.20
I've been, we'll get to some of the leadership a little bit later, but I did want to jump into this point on leadership right now.

1528
02:17:18.20 --> 02:17:28.20
You say this leaders who balance the competing demands of results and relationships are able to push for the achievement of goals while eliciting the best from their people.

1529
02:17:28.20 --> 02:17:43.20
It's as if they have two bank accounts, they make their deposit they make deposits in their results account by consistently accomplishing their goals and they build up capital in their relationship account by caring for their people as individuals of worth.

1530
02:17:43.20 --> 02:17:51.20
In the first instance, they earn credibility with their superiors and in the second they earn loyalty from their followers.

1531
02:17:51.20 --> 02:17:55.20
Occasionally leaders will need to make withdrawals from these bank accounts.

1532
02:17:55.20 --> 02:18:10.20
For example, a leader who is being pressured by unrealistic expectations from above may need to draw on the credibility she's accumulated with her results bank account and say to her superiors, we need to adjust this timetable or burn out our people.

1533
02:18:10.20 --> 02:18:18.20
At other times, she may have to make a withdrawal from the relationship bank account and say to her team, we'll have to work over the weekend to get this job done.

1534
02:18:18.20 --> 02:18:27.20
With regard to balancing mission and people, Admiral Stockdale wisely said, a leader must remember that he is responsible for his charges.

1535
02:18:27.20 --> 02:18:35.20
He must tend to his flock, not only cracking the whip, but washing their feet when they are in need of help.

1536
02:18:35.20 --> 02:18:47.20
Balancing results and relationships is a major leadership challenge. Some leaders are naturally gifted with the head logic and not very good with the heart feelings. Others are the opposite.

1537
02:18:47.20 --> 02:18:52.20
Only about 20% of the population has a natural ability with both.

1538
02:18:52.20 --> 02:19:02.20
Even those with this tightrope walking capability often end up tilting toward a results oriented style because results are typically what get noticed and rewarded.

1539
02:19:02.20 --> 02:19:08.20
If your leadership style is unbalanced, the good news is that you don't have to reinvent yourself.

1540
02:19:08.20 --> 02:19:16.20
To gain better balance, you simply have to develop some of the skills you lack. Simply put, you may either need to toughen up or soften up.

1541
02:19:16.20 --> 02:19:21.20
This may sound artificial, but with practice, your adapted behaviors will feel more comfortable.

1542
02:19:21.20 --> 02:19:30.20
They will never become totally natural, however, so you'll have to consistently and intentionally work at keeping your balance.

1543
02:19:30.20 --> 02:19:34.20
I make a living on that right there.

1544
02:19:34.20 --> 02:19:49.20
I've coached CEOs. I coached a CEO who was a West Point graduate, Army Ranger, had a Harvard MBA, and when I told him, when I confronted him, so to speak, I said, you don't give any positive feedback to your team.

1545
02:19:49.20 --> 02:20:01.20
He had a really good executive team. He said, well, that's just not me. I said, wait a minute, you know better than that.

1546
02:20:01.20 --> 02:20:15.20
I said, your people, they're all different kinds and some of them need a lot more affirmation and feedback than others, but they all need to know that you believe in them, that you care about them, that you see how well they're doing.

1547
02:20:15.20 --> 02:20:37.20
Well, we actually wrote him out a three-centus affirmation for one of the VPs on his team, and I had him stand in front of the mirror and practice smiling to the point that he felt, I said, I want you to go to the point you feel almost ridiculous smiling and energetic and enthusiastic when you say this.

1548
02:20:37.20 --> 02:20:53.20
And he practiced and he did it, and his team performance really went up, but I've coached him for two months, and when I finished his, he said, the last day I was with him, he said, hey, can you stay five minutes after we finish today?

1549
02:20:53.20 --> 02:21:19.20
I said, sure. He said, I got somebody who wants you to meet, so we finished. He jumps up, runs out in the hall, brings in a lady and introduces her as his wife, and she said, well, I just wanted to meet you and say thank you because we have one son, we have one child, one son who's 13 years old, and in the last two or three months, his relationship with our son has totally changed.

1550
02:21:19.20 --> 02:21:28.20
He sits down and asks him questions and listens to him and smiles and encourages him. He said, it's just wonderful. Thank you.

1551
02:21:28.20 --> 02:21:39.20
And I said, well, he did it. He courageously learned how to do things. Well, ten years later, I saw that CEO in a meeting in Atlanta, and I said, how are you doing?

1552
02:21:39.20 --> 02:21:50.20
He said, fine, how's your son doing? Oh, he graduated from college, and he's working at the bank now and says he and I are going to run a half marathon together on Saturday. It just totally changed him.

1553
02:21:50.20 --> 02:22:08.20
Here's a guy who was so results-oriented, he could not even think anything about feelings or relationships or what people's needs were, but once he started letting people know that he cared about them and believed in them, it totally changed his leadership.

1554
02:22:08.20 --> 02:22:14.20
And now he's the CEO of another company, and they think he's the best CEO they ever had.

1555
02:22:14.20 --> 02:22:18.20
Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome.

1556
02:22:18.20 --> 02:22:39.20
And then Leif and I wrote another book, which is called the dichotomy of leadership and what the dichotomy of leadership is about is this. And there's all kinds of different dichotomies we talk about. The first chapter is about, hey, you've got these guys that you love more than anything else in the world, and you're going to send them out on missions that may get them killed.

1557
02:22:39.20 --> 02:22:51.20
And how do you balance that? You got to balance that. And you got to have, you got to care about the men, but you've got to also accomplish the mission. Ultimately, if you don't take care of your men, you're not going to have anyone to execute the mission.

1558
02:22:51.20 --> 02:23:06.20
So you have to prioritize taking care of your team, but you've got the same exact theory here. It was just awesome for me to read it in a different vocabulary, but the exact same message and holds true in any situation.

1559
02:23:06.20 --> 02:23:18.20
And, you know, that chapter or that title, dichotomy of leadership was the last chapter in the book, Extreme Ownership. Because, you know, we said, hey, listen, you're going to be pulled in multiple different directions.

1560
02:23:18.20 --> 02:23:25.20
You got to stay balanced as a leader. That's the thing you got to do. And there's a bunch of categories. You know, you could be a micromanager if you go too far in management.

1561
02:23:25.20 --> 02:23:33.20
You could be too hands off. No one knows what's going on. So communicating. You communicate too much. You communicate too little. So you want to be balanced.

1562
02:23:33.20 --> 02:23:43.20
But we wrote that as one chapter. But as we went out and continue to work with companies, the biggest problem companies have, the biggest problem leaders have would be finding that balance.

1563
02:23:43.20 --> 02:23:54.20
And then like you say in here, you know, people have what they tend towards, right? Some people tend towards, I just need to take care of everyone and they take care of everyone to the point that they don't get anything done.

1564
02:23:54.20 --> 02:23:55.20
Exactly.

1565
02:23:55.20 --> 02:24:04.20
And you have people that tend towards, I'm just going to get the mission done and I don't care what happens. I don't care who's back, I step on to get there. So, uh...

1566
02:24:04.20 --> 02:24:16.20
Yeah, I quoted your book Extreme Ownership a couple of times in my books too, by the way, because I saw your mindset said what I wanted to say and I said, let Jaco say it.

1567
02:24:16.20 --> 02:24:29.20
Yeah, well, in the dichotomy of leadership, we pose all kinds of these opposing forces that you have as a leader. And the opposing force that you phrase very succinctly is results versus relationship.

1568
02:24:29.20 --> 02:24:32.20
Those are two things that are pulling you in opposite directions.

1569
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:33.20
Mission and people.

1570
02:24:33.20 --> 02:24:34.20
And you got to stay balanced.

1571
02:24:34.20 --> 02:24:47.20
You know, I've been working in assessments of human behavior for 32 years and the one thing I know is that 40% of the population is wired toward results, mission, focus.

1572
02:24:47.20 --> 02:25:00.20
And 40% are wired more towards people, patients, relationship, social focus. And 20% have some of both. But to be a great leader, you have to do both.

1573
02:25:00.20 --> 02:25:10.20
So you're going to have to learn to adapt in certain situations to be either tougher or more affirming and kind.

1574
02:25:10.20 --> 02:25:24.20
The thing that everybody needs to understand, and this goes to the POW, it goes to the fight a pilot world, it goes to everywhere, is that every human being wants to feel valued and important, worthy.

1575
02:25:24.20 --> 02:25:44.20
And when you as a leader are able to let them know that you value them, that you appreciate them, that you believe they have a future, you believe in their future, and that you're going to help them develop, it totally changes their loyalty, their commitment.

1576
02:25:44.20 --> 02:25:48.20
They're going to work harder. They don't want to let you down.

1577
02:25:48.20 --> 02:25:55.20
But that's not easy for results, mission, focus, leaders. It's just not part of their natural mindset.

1578
02:25:55.20 --> 02:26:13.20
You know, Richard Boyatsis, Dr. Richard Boyatsis, who was one of the co-authors of the big emotional intelligence book that came out in 2002 or three, I have a video, a two and a half minute video of him talking about the brain, the networks in the brain.

1579
02:26:13.20 --> 02:26:23.20
And he said there's the task focus network and the social network, which is very similar to what we're talking about here, mission, people, results, relationship.

1580
02:26:23.20 --> 02:26:34.20
And he said they can actually see with the MRIs of the brain that when a person is working a problem that the social network goes quiet and shuts down.

1581
02:26:34.20 --> 02:26:39.20
And it's all focused on results, results, results, solving a problem.

1582
02:26:39.20 --> 02:26:46.20
And he says, but the problem is you have to do both and you have to learn to switch.

1583
02:26:46.20 --> 02:26:56.20
And he said in our schools, our business schools, our MBA programs, so much of the time it's spent on results, results, results, results.

1584
02:26:56.20 --> 02:27:06.20
And they don't teach them much about learning to deal with people and let people know you care about them, that you appreciate them and that they're valuable, they're important.

1585
02:27:06.20 --> 02:27:25.20
And you know there's another thing I've watched as a guy out in California who's a PhD psychologist and he talks about the monitoring of the child's brain, a baby 69 months old, an MRI of a baby 69 months old.

1586
02:27:25.20 --> 02:27:33.20
When somebody smiles at them and cuddles them, their prefrontal cortex develops in a healthy way.

1587
02:27:33.20 --> 02:27:46.20
And so the whole concept is that for a small child, unconditional love is the most positive thing and people that have had a lot, their prefrontal cortex develops in a more healthy way.

1588
02:27:46.20 --> 02:27:52.20
They have less problems working with people and doing their job too.

1589
02:27:52.20 --> 02:27:57.20
But every human being wants to be cared about.

1590
02:27:57.20 --> 02:28:06.20
And I have a model now, it's called insecure-secure. And on the left side is insecure.

1591
02:28:06.20 --> 02:28:15.20
And this model on the left side is insecure and the right side of this continuum is secure. Secure is confident and humble.

1592
02:28:15.20 --> 02:28:22.20
Insecure has doubts, fears, shame, guilt, all these things that cause us to be insecure.

1593
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:28.20
And we all can be insecure in some places. So we slide back and forth on this model.

1594
02:28:28.20 --> 02:28:33.20
But healthy people spend most of their time over on the secure side.

1595
02:28:33.20 --> 02:28:40.20
And as a leader, my goal and your goal should be how can we help our people become more secure?

1596
02:28:40.20 --> 02:28:49.20
Because the more secure they are, the more confident they're going to be and they're able to do things, but also they're going to be more humble and admit when they do it, don't do it.

1597
02:28:49.20 --> 02:28:55.20
Okay? So how can you do that? You have to help them believe in themselves.

1598
02:28:55.20 --> 02:29:10.20
What can you do to help? So I came up with a simple, the four As, acknowledge their existence, accept them for who they are, show some appreciation and affirmation.

1599
02:29:10.20 --> 02:29:19.20
And find those have to be legitimate affirmations for something they've done, but make an effort to do that.

1600
02:29:19.20 --> 02:29:30.20
One CEO coach, I had him put all the people's names across the top in a spreadsheet and all the things he needed to get to know about them down the side.

1601
02:29:30.20 --> 02:29:35.20
Because he said, I don't do that. I don't go down to their office. I don't talk to them because I thought my job.

1602
02:29:35.20 --> 02:29:43.20
And I said, well, I think it. So he had, he was so results oriented. I had him check them off.

1603
02:29:43.20 --> 02:29:51.20
Every time you go to that person's office and do that, you check it off. And that was how he learned how to do it.

1604
02:29:51.20 --> 02:30:03.20
Yeah, that's awesome stuff. Number one for me, a lot of times, you know, when you talk about how to build people's confidence and the four As great.

1605
02:30:03.20 --> 02:30:09.20
Well, one of my favorite tools in leadership is leadership. My favorite tools in leadership is leadership.

1606
02:30:09.20 --> 02:30:16.20
So I went through my whole career to this day when I want someone when I want to show someone I appreciate them, when I want to show them, I trust them.

1607
02:30:16.20 --> 02:30:22.20
I'm going to put in charge of stuff. I'm going to put them in leadership positions and that's going to elevate the way they feel about themselves.

1608
02:30:22.20 --> 02:30:26.20
They're going to know that I trust them that are going to know I appreciate them because I'm giving them more autonomy.

1609
02:30:26.20 --> 02:30:34.20
So that's just totally in line. Another thing that we talk about at our company is something we call the leadership loop.

1610
02:30:34.20 --> 02:30:45.20
And it's just things to think about as you're leading people. And the heaviest weight when I'm making a leadership decision is what is it going to do to my leadership capital?

1611
02:30:45.20 --> 02:30:55.20
So if I, you know, Dave's got a project that's due and it's going to look the client wants it by by Wednesday and I know it's going to impact the way Dave's, you know, his weekend is going to ruin his weekend.

1612
02:30:55.20 --> 02:31:03.20
I'm actually going to weigh out. Hey, is this worth the impact it's going to have to my leadership capital that I have with Dave?

1613
02:31:03.20 --> 02:31:07.20
And maybe I say, you know what, I'm going to call the client and say, hey, listen, we're going to have to push this back a few days.

1614
02:31:07.20 --> 02:31:15.20
Or I call Dave, you know, if it's if it's going to ruin the relationship with the client. Hey, Dave, this is, you know, I got to cash in some of these chips, man, we got to get this thing done.

1615
02:31:15.20 --> 02:31:19.20
Where do you want to meet to get this thing worked on this weekend because we got to get this thing done.

1616
02:31:19.20 --> 02:31:29.20
So, so that's again, just in line different verbiage. And then the other thing is when it comes to results oriented.

1617
02:31:29.20 --> 02:31:36.20
And I'm saying to myself, you know, man, for me to put some for me to give Dave this project and goons some more autonomy.

1618
02:31:36.20 --> 02:31:44.20
He can't do this as good as me. And so a lot of times, you know, people say, I just want to get it done. I want to get it done right.

1619
02:31:44.20 --> 02:31:52.20
The problem with that is it's a short term win because over time I haven't developed Dave into a into a better leader that understands how to get these projects done.

1620
02:31:52.20 --> 02:32:04.20
So I need to think of things in a strategic manner. So my goal becomes not the result immediate results for this particular project.

1621
02:32:04.20 --> 02:32:16.20
The goal becomes winning in a long term strategic way where I've trained up not just Dave, but three or four other of his peers that can all step up and get this stuff done.

1622
02:32:16.20 --> 02:32:28.20
Now we can win on a much broader scale and we're going to get much more profound strategic results than if I just get stuff done myself because that's what the result oriented leader often wants to do.

1623
02:32:28.20 --> 02:32:37.20
So you believed in him 100% when you did that you believed in him and he don't want to let you down. That's the way it works.

1624
02:32:37.20 --> 02:32:49.20
I had to read this part. You said over at camp over at Plantation Camp Charlie Plum Lieutenant J.G. United States Navy was the resident inventor and engineer with a strong background in electronics.

1625
02:32:49.20 --> 02:33:00.20
He developed more than a dozen devices to measure time temperature and weight. He was well on his way to making a radio when the V discovered his stash of razor blades nails, wire spools and tinfoil.

1626
02:33:00.20 --> 02:33:06.20
Plum also scratched a keyboard on his bed boards and went over the notes until he could hear them in his head.

1627
02:33:06.20 --> 02:33:13.20
So we had Charlie Plum on this on this podcast number 76 and number 95.

1628
02:33:13.20 --> 02:33:22.20
So when you're in camp you're memorizing each other's names right? We're memorizing all the names of every. Do you remember Charlie Plum's name? When you were in camp?

1629
02:33:22.20 --> 02:33:23.20
Yeah.

1630
02:33:23.20 --> 02:33:25.20
And then you met him afterwards?

1631
02:33:25.20 --> 02:33:26.20
Yeah.

1632
02:33:26.20 --> 02:33:30.20
Crazy, crazy.

1633
02:33:30.20 --> 02:33:37.20
When you're in there and people do you sort of get to know people even though you've never even seen them?

1634
02:33:37.20 --> 02:33:45.20
Yes and no because sometimes you might be with someone who does know them and they tell you about them.

1635
02:33:45.20 --> 02:33:52.20
That's another thing Charlie Plum mentioned to me. He said you know you're in a cell with four guys.

1636
02:33:52.20 --> 02:34:06.20
He said it was around the three month mark. You knew absolutely every detail of their life, every movie they'd seen, every TV show they watched, who all their teachers were, what their, you know, every girlfriend that they ever had,

1637
02:34:06.20 --> 02:34:13.20
their family, their brothers, girlfriends, he just knew everything and he said when a new person would come into the cell.

1638
02:34:13.20 --> 02:34:14.20
It was like all ears.

1639
02:34:14.20 --> 02:34:15.20
Not stop.

1640
02:34:15.20 --> 02:34:18.20
Just like tell us your entire life story.

1641
02:34:18.20 --> 02:34:19.20
Yeah.

1642
02:34:19.20 --> 02:34:22.20
That's crazy.

1643
02:34:22.20 --> 02:34:32.20
I'm gonna fast forward here again. I'm gonna fast forward through a bunch of stuff but we're getting towards the end here.

1644
02:34:32.20 --> 02:34:43.20
Early on our final day of captivity, the V issued each of us a pair of dark blue cotton slacks, a long sleeve blue shirt, a gray windbreaker and a small gym bag and a pair of shoes.

1645
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:48.20
We didn't waste any time getting dressed for the first time in more than five years.

1646
02:34:48.20 --> 02:34:53.20
We would be wearing something other than black or maroon striped pajamas.

1647
02:34:53.20 --> 02:35:01.20
My feet had become so accustomed to rubber tread tires held on by straps across the toe that I wondered if I would have trouble putting on real shoes.

1648
02:35:01.20 --> 02:35:02.20
It was not a problem.

1649
02:35:02.20 --> 02:35:07.20
Yes, this was the day, the long awaited day and we were functioning as if it was just another day at work.

1650
02:35:07.20 --> 02:35:10.20
To be honest, I was more curious than excited.

1651
02:35:10.20 --> 02:35:14.20
I had grown to be so cautious that my emotions were flat as a table.

1652
02:35:14.20 --> 02:35:26.20
After five years, four months and two weeks, 1,955 days of captivity, I was going to walk through this exercise and see what happened.

1653
02:35:26.20 --> 02:35:32.20
As our names were called, we stepped forward and saluted the senior U.S. Air Force officer who was receiving us.

1654
02:35:32.20 --> 02:35:41.20
We were then escorted to three waiting C141s, a bird ever after to be known as the Hanoi taxi.

1655
02:35:41.20 --> 02:35:49.20
When we were all loaded, the walk on tailgates were closed and the windowless aircraft, which felt inside somewhat like a cave, began taxing out.

1656
02:35:49.20 --> 02:36:00.20
The lack of visibility brought to mind a trip I had taken less than a year earlier when we were transported under a tarp in the back of a truck from the Hanoi north to dog patch.

1657
02:36:00.20 --> 02:36:06.20
On today's journey, though, there would be no blindfolds, handcuffs, guards, or bone jarring bounces.

1658
02:36:06.20 --> 02:36:12.20
The revving of the C141s four big engines caused my heart to race.

1659
02:36:12.20 --> 02:36:16.20
Pilots loved the feeling of power during the run-up and take-off.

1660
02:36:16.20 --> 02:36:23.20
This time it was almost surreal as the brakes released and our Hanoi taxi accelerated smoothly down the runway.

1661
02:36:23.20 --> 02:36:26.20
We held our breath waiting, waiting, waiting.

1662
02:36:26.20 --> 02:36:28.20
Finally, the wheels broke ground.

1663
02:36:28.20 --> 02:36:29.20
We were airborne.

1664
02:36:29.20 --> 02:36:34.20
A bedlam of cheers, yells, whistles, and footstamps erupted in the cabin.

1665
02:36:34.20 --> 02:36:38.20
Our destination was the big hospital at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.

1666
02:36:38.20 --> 02:36:44.20
As the primary air force staging base in both the Korean and Vietnam wars, it was a familiar place to most of us.

1667
02:36:44.20 --> 02:36:48.20
A few minutes after takeoff, the aircraft commander came on the intercom.

1668
02:36:48.20 --> 02:36:52.20
Gentlemen, we are feet wet and over international waters.

1669
02:36:52.20 --> 02:36:54.20
A roar went up.

1670
02:36:54.20 --> 02:36:59.20
The captives, indeed, were free.

1671
02:36:59.20 --> 02:37:13.20
On the flight to Clark Air Force Base, we smoked cigars, circulated, shook hands, looked at the latest magazines, visited the cockpit where I was taken aback to see that the aircraft commander was a captain about my age, still under 30.

1672
02:37:13.20 --> 02:37:16.20
We also took turns hugging the three nurses on board.

1673
02:37:16.20 --> 02:37:23.20
Other than a couple Vietnamese kitchen coolies, we had not seen a female in all those years.

1674
02:37:23.20 --> 02:37:33.20
As the Hanoi taxi rolled into VIP parking space at Clark, we were surprised to see a large crowd waiting with welcome signs and banners.

1675
02:37:33.20 --> 02:37:42.20
As we de-planed, the cheers and tears of the crowd warmed our hearts and calmed our anxieties about our re-entry into a radically altered world.

1676
02:37:42.20 --> 02:37:45.20
It was a shock to be treated like returning heroes.

1677
02:37:45.20 --> 02:37:48.20
We did not see ourselves as heroic.

1678
02:37:48.20 --> 02:37:51.20
We had simply done our duty.

1679
02:37:56.20 --> 02:37:59.20
So, that's a...

1680
02:38:01.20 --> 02:38:03.20
Can't even imagine what that was like.

1681
02:38:03.20 --> 02:38:12.20
You know, we were, as I said, emotionally, we were so flat, it was like, okay, what's next?

1682
02:38:12.20 --> 02:38:17.20
But we were thrilled with the crowd and it was exciting.

1683
02:38:17.20 --> 02:38:23.20
But it was always thinking, okay, this is good, what's next?

1684
02:38:23.20 --> 02:38:29.20
That was mine, and I'm sure most people, because I didn't know what to expect.

1685
02:38:29.20 --> 02:38:36.20
What was the biggest... and look, you talk a lot in the book about what you're actually doing.

1686
02:38:36.20 --> 02:38:46.20
You talk about one guy that he must have made three or four rotations through the chow hall line, getting sausages and eggs and steak and ice cream and everything.

1687
02:38:46.20 --> 02:38:48.20
You talk about some of that stuff.

1688
02:38:48.20 --> 02:38:59.20
I mean, you got captured in 1967, as we mentioned, this was before the hippie movement had really come out.

1689
02:38:59.20 --> 02:39:03.20
What was your view as you came back to this radically changed world?

1690
02:39:03.20 --> 02:39:09.20
That's the term that uses radically changed, and it was a radical change.

1691
02:39:09.20 --> 02:39:25.20
I was protected in that going back to Georgia and small towns, it wasn't as extreme as it would have been maybe in San Diego or San Francisco or somewhere around San Diego, but San Francisco, L.A.

1692
02:39:25.20 --> 02:39:27.20
So it's somewhat protected.

1693
02:39:27.20 --> 02:39:37.20
But I think there were several folks that threw parties for me, high school, college friends and that sort of thing.

1694
02:39:37.20 --> 02:39:39.20
And family.

1695
02:39:39.20 --> 02:39:47.20
And there was a young lady who was my age, college, went to college with her, but she was an anti-war person.

1696
02:39:47.20 --> 02:39:53.20
She'd become a college university professor, I think, was anti-war.

1697
02:39:53.20 --> 02:40:01.20
But she was my friend, and I did not show any disrespect for her, and she didn't show any for me.

1698
02:40:01.20 --> 02:40:04.20
We were friendly and treated each other respectfully.

1699
02:40:04.20 --> 02:40:14.20
I think it was some of the extremists, though, that spit on soldiers in uniform and insulted them.

1700
02:40:14.20 --> 02:40:19.20
I didn't encounter too many of those, but a lot of people did.

1701
02:40:19.20 --> 02:40:30.20
And POWs, we didn't, because the war it ended, it was over, and there was something to celebrate, and we kind of became something to celebrate that the war was over.

1702
02:40:30.20 --> 02:40:39.20
So I think both sides, at least anti-war people, tolerated us, at least when we first came home.

1703
02:40:39.20 --> 02:40:43.20
And so we didn't get any of that negative stuff.

1704
02:40:43.20 --> 02:40:48.20
And I think that made it a lot better for us and a lot easier for us to make that transition.

1705
02:40:48.20 --> 02:41:07.20
Again, we kind of touched it on and already, but just the unity that you had as POWs, the time you had spent together, the fact that you had bore your soul to each other and to yourselves,

1706
02:41:07.20 --> 02:41:24.20
this sort of absolute ownership, this extreme ownership of who you were as people, that you all came out of this shockingly, shockingly well.

1707
02:41:24.20 --> 02:41:26.20
Shockingly well.

1708
02:41:26.20 --> 02:41:27.20
Yeah, it is.

1709
02:41:27.20 --> 02:41:36.20
When you look at what we did and where we've been and all as a group, it is shockingly well as the way we came home.

1710
02:41:36.20 --> 02:41:48.20
And I think, you know, here's one example in looking at my own self, is I realized after I retired, I never worried about getting promoted.

1711
02:41:48.20 --> 02:41:52.20
I did my job as best I possibly could.

1712
02:41:52.20 --> 02:41:56.20
I just wanted to do a good job, and I came back and went to work.

1713
02:41:56.20 --> 02:41:59.20
And I didn't want any special treatment.

1714
02:41:59.20 --> 02:42:03.20
I just wanted to prove I could do my job and to be successful with it.

1715
02:42:03.20 --> 02:42:09.20
But I didn't worry about getting promoted to be, I didn't worry about getting this job or that job.

1716
02:42:09.20 --> 02:42:15.20
You know, I just, it's coming, it's coming nice and whatever happens is going to happen, you know.

1717
02:42:15.20 --> 02:42:21.20
So it, because I didn't have insecurity, going back to the insecure, secure.

1718
02:42:21.20 --> 02:42:27.20
How can I be insecure when I've got a good job, flying airplanes?

1719
02:42:27.20 --> 02:42:29.20
I'm a flight commander.

1720
02:42:29.20 --> 02:42:30.20
I'm a section commander.

1721
02:42:30.20 --> 02:42:33.20
I'm a chief of standardization.

1722
02:42:33.20 --> 02:42:35.20
I'm a chief check pilot on the base.

1723
02:42:35.20 --> 02:42:36.20
I'm a squadron commander.

1724
02:42:36.20 --> 02:42:39.20
I mean, I have had it so good.

1725
02:42:39.20 --> 02:42:43.20
And I don't think they gave me those jobs because I'd been a POW.

1726
02:42:43.20 --> 02:42:46.20
You know, I had to prove that I could do it.

1727
02:42:46.20 --> 02:42:50.20
My, my units got high ratings.

1728
02:42:50.20 --> 02:42:53.20
They didn't give them high ratings because of me.

1729
02:42:53.20 --> 02:43:03.20
They, the IG or the inspectors would come in and the standardization evaluation, they'd come in and because I had good guys doing good jobs.

1730
02:43:03.20 --> 02:43:04.20
Okay.

1731
02:43:04.20 --> 02:43:06.20
My team was doing their job really well.

1732
02:43:06.20 --> 02:43:07.20
Well, okay.

1733
02:43:07.20 --> 02:43:10.20
I think I helped them in retrospect.

1734
02:43:10.20 --> 02:43:17.20
I didn't think about that at any of that at the time, but now I say, okay, I guess I was doing okay.

1735
02:43:17.20 --> 02:43:29.20
Yeah. And the other thing is, you know, if you're going to be the, let's say the senior check pilot on base and you are looking at your skill set and you say, oh, you know, I could, I could get a little bit better at this.

1736
02:43:29.20 --> 02:43:33.20
You're the type of person that goes, well, I'll go work on it and I'll improve on it.

1737
02:43:33.20 --> 02:43:35.20
So I can be better at this.

1738
02:43:35.20 --> 02:43:45.20
And those are the kind of people that ultimately get to a higher level because they're being honest with themselves, taking ownership of their shortfalls and then making corrections.

1739
02:43:45.20 --> 02:43:50.20
Yeah. I, you know, that's, that leads to debrief.

1740
02:43:50.20 --> 02:43:55.20
One of the most important things a person, a leader can do is debrief.

1741
02:43:55.20 --> 02:44:05.20
And when I make a presentation, I debrief afterwards and say, what did, what did I do well to myself and what did I could have done better in this situation?

1742
02:44:05.20 --> 02:44:11.20
And when I go to a meeting, okay, and I walk out of that meeting, I say, what did I do well?

1743
02:44:11.20 --> 02:44:13.20
What could I've done better?

1744
02:44:13.20 --> 02:44:19.20
And I coached myself, okay, next time you need to do this or this or a little bit better.

1745
02:44:19.20 --> 02:44:24.20
And I do the same thing when I am at home with my wife.

1746
02:44:24.20 --> 02:44:27.20
There are times when I mess up, guys.

1747
02:44:27.20 --> 02:44:31.20
And I debrief myself after that and say, oh, what could I've done better?

1748
02:44:31.20 --> 02:44:33.20
Let's see, what can I take ownership for?

1749
02:44:33.20 --> 02:44:39.20
Sometimes my wife even debriefs me formally, you know, which is a bonus.

1750
02:44:39.20 --> 02:44:49.20
I mentioned this earlier. So in the book, this is a leadership book and it's a leadership book filled with stories with a bunch of stories and examples of leadership.

1751
02:44:49.20 --> 02:44:57.20
And at the end of each one of these sections, you go through what you call footstompers and it's a very common term.

1752
02:44:57.20 --> 02:45:04.20
I don't have to, I don't know civilians use the term footstompers, but in the military, we certainly all branches use this term footstompers,

1753
02:45:04.20 --> 02:45:11.20
which is when you're learning something from an instructor and they hit a point that's going to be on the test.

1754
02:45:11.20 --> 02:45:15.20
They'll they'll stop their foot on the ground like, hey, listen up, you better pay attention.

1755
02:45:15.20 --> 02:45:24.20
So you have these these sort of leadership footstompers at the end of the book and they're throughout the book, but you you summarize them here.

1756
02:45:24.20 --> 02:45:29.20
So I just wanted to go through these to close out this.

1757
02:45:29.20 --> 02:45:35.20
Number one, know yourself. Authentic leadership flows from inside out.

1758
02:45:35.20 --> 02:45:47.20
You will be most successful and fulfilled when you clarify who you uniquely are in terms of purpose, passion, personality, and then lead authentically from that core.

1759
02:45:47.20 --> 02:45:55.20
And by the way, everybody can tell. And if you're pretend trying to pretend to be someone, you're not people can tell it.

1760
02:45:55.20 --> 02:46:02.20
I always say intent has a smell. So if you're like you just said, you never tried to get promoted. I never tried to get promoted either.

1761
02:46:02.20 --> 02:46:08.20
It's like, oh, I'm going to work hard. And I kind of I had an advantage that I was a prior enlisted officer.

1762
02:46:08.20 --> 02:46:16.20
So if I didn't get promoted, oh, well, I was still in the Navy for 20 years. They couldn't do anything to me.

1763
02:46:16.20 --> 02:46:23.20
But that intent has a smell. So like you say here, be authentic.

1764
02:46:23.20 --> 02:46:35.20
Number two, guard your character authentic leaders intentionally guard their character clarify your values of specificity and total honesty, then structure a support team to help you live them with courage and transparency.

1765
02:46:35.20 --> 02:46:45.20
Number three, stay positive. A positive attitude is one of leaders greatest assets and it's one of the best ways you can influence and lead others keep your chin up because when it goes down you do too.

1766
02:46:45.20 --> 02:46:56.20
And many others will follow right behind. And I don't know if there's any examples throughout history stronger than you all have from being this POW camp for positive attitude.

1767
02:46:56.20 --> 02:47:00.20
So everyone can learn from that.

1768
02:47:00.20 --> 02:47:12.20
Confront your doubts and fears authentic leaders develop courage as an act of will choose today to do what you know to be right even when it feels unnatural or unsafe.

1769
02:47:12.20 --> 02:47:23.20
Trust yourself, honor your values, lean into your pain and intentionally engage issues with strength and humility, despite your fears.

1770
02:47:23.20 --> 02:47:29.20
Number five, fight to win. Successful leaders believe in their mission and fight to carry it out successfully. They don't quit.

1771
02:47:29.20 --> 02:47:34.20
They expect to win. They take others with them and they give the others the credit.

1772
02:47:34.20 --> 02:47:44.20
Number six, bounce back. Authentic leaders know that life is difficult. They expect to get knocked down and they have the proper attitude and outlook to enable them to persevere.

1773
02:47:44.20 --> 02:47:51.20
You have a choice about how you respond to difficulties. Confront the brutal realities of your situation but never give up hope.

1774
02:47:51.20 --> 02:47:56.20
Develop your plan. Connect with your support team and bounce back.

1775
02:47:56.20 --> 02:48:07.20
And then you get into a section leading others. Clarify and build your culture. Authentic leaders intentionally define and build cultures that further the mission, vision and values of their organization.

1776
02:48:07.20 --> 02:48:16.20
Assess the culture of your organization and take the appropriate steps to make sure it is well defined, soundly structured and effectively communicated.

1777
02:48:16.20 --> 02:48:26.20
Number eight, over-communicate the message. Effective communication requires intentional effort to overcome noise, distractions and misinterpretations in the workplace.

1778
02:48:26.20 --> 02:48:33.20
You must develop a clear message and comprehensive communication plan. Then you must over-communicate your message multiple times through multiple channels.

1779
02:48:33.20 --> 02:48:43.20
And I don't care what environment you're in, whatever communication methodology you have is not as hard as tapping on walls with the threat of being tortured or killed.

1780
02:48:43.20 --> 02:48:47.20
So you can improve the communication inside your organization.

1781
02:48:47.20 --> 02:48:55.20
Number nine, develop your people. Authentic leaders engage in continual development. Knowledge alone is not enough. The only way to grow as a leader is to do things differently.

1782
02:48:55.20 --> 02:49:06.20
That requires change. Go first and then take your people with you. And again, I don't think there's anybody that has to work harder to develop their people than creating college courses inside of a prison camp.

1783
02:49:06.20 --> 02:49:08.20
No books.

1784
02:49:08.20 --> 02:49:11.20
No books. Do it all from memory.

1785
02:49:11.20 --> 02:49:19.20
Number 10, balance mission in people. Outstanding leaders balance accomplishment of the mission, results and care for the people, relationships.

1786
02:49:19.20 --> 02:49:24.20
However, the styles of most leaders are naturally biased towards one end of the spectrum or another.

1787
02:49:24.20 --> 02:49:36.20
To enhance your leadership effectiveness, find out which type of skills you need to develop. Then leaning into the pain of your doubts and fears, adapt your behaviors to do what you know a good leader should do.

1788
02:49:36.20 --> 02:49:41.20
It's another thing that's weird about these tendencies that we have is when we go against them, we think we're wrong.

1789
02:49:41.20 --> 02:49:52.20
You know, we think like we're going to get in trouble. We think that, I better not do that. I need to focus on results so that ego will start chiming in.

1790
02:49:52.20 --> 02:50:01.20
Number 11, build cohesive teams. Build trust by helping teammates gain understanding, acceptance and respect for each other.

1791
02:50:01.20 --> 02:50:13.20
The resulting unity and cohesion will enable them to engage in creative conflict, which in turn will build the commitment and loyalty necessary to overcome the most difficult challenges.

1792
02:50:13.20 --> 02:50:19.20
Underrated way of building a cohesive team, listening to what the team has to say.

1793
02:50:19.20 --> 02:50:29.20
There's a lot. I didn't, a lot of examples you give in the book about this is how much discussion and input the SROs would take when coming up with a decision.

1794
02:50:29.20 --> 02:50:35.20
It wasn't like the SROs just created the ideas in a vacuum and then imposed them on the team.

1795
02:50:35.20 --> 02:50:45.20
You all would have discussions and you describe it in the book as often passionate discussions about what the course of action was.

1796
02:50:45.20 --> 02:50:51.20
Number 12, exploit creativity. Think futuristically and innovate to stay competitive.

1797
02:50:51.20 --> 02:50:58.20
Everyone has the capacity for innovative ideas. The leaders job is to draw them out, harness the ideas of creative folks and allow them to pull you ahead of the competition.

1798
02:50:58.20 --> 02:51:10.20
And yeah, I read that one little section of Charlie Plum, but that's, there's a whole section that you're talking about all these different individuals and all the things that they did to improve life in the camp.

1799
02:51:10.20 --> 02:51:17.20
You know, most of the creativity comes from the bottom up and leaders need to be aware of that.

1800
02:51:17.20 --> 02:51:27.20
They're not saying you have to adapt every idea that comes up, but quite often the people doing the work have the most creative ideas of how to do it better and fix it.

1801
02:51:27.20 --> 02:51:36.20
Yeah, no doubt about that. You have to be paying attention to what the people on the front lines are saying.

1802
02:51:36.20 --> 02:51:46.20
Number 13, treasure your trials and celebrate your successes. Effective leadership is forged in the crucible of struggles and fueled by the celebration of accomplishment to promote teamwork and achieve success.

1803
02:51:46.20 --> 02:52:04.20
Treasure your trials and celebrate your victories. And the last one, free the captives. Authentic leaders proactively identify the shackles that hold them back and lean into the pain to break free and grow as you gain your own freedom begin helping others to do the same.

1804
02:52:04.20 --> 02:52:13.20
Start by avoiding bitterness, connecting with your emotions and doing the right thing, even when it's difficult.

1805
02:52:13.20 --> 02:52:33.20
So those are the the footstompers and and to get like more of the details around those and great examples. Everyone that's listening, get the book.

1806
02:52:33.20 --> 02:52:49.20
Now, you have this next book. The book is called Engage with Honor, and we're not going to do it today, but at some point, hopefully you can come back and we can cover that book and the ideas that are in that book and the stories that are in that book.

1807
02:52:49.20 --> 02:53:06.20
But I wanted to just quickly just to kind of introduce people to what I thought was a really outstanding part of the book and also kind of the crux or one of the cruxes of the book, because the book is called the book is called Engage with Honor.

1808
02:53:06.20 --> 02:53:26.20
So I'm skipping to this section here. It's called Learn to Engage. It says, collaboration requires engagement. Unfortunately, many leaders respond out of unhealthy emotions. Instead of engaging to collaborate, they let negative emotions drive them to either dominate or withdraw.

1809
02:53:26.20 --> 02:53:37.20
And again, going back to the dichotomy of leadership, these are two extremes that are bad dominating a conversation dominating ideas or withdrawing from conversation or withdrawing from ideas.

1810
02:53:37.20 --> 02:53:47.20
And this is presented in the leadership engagement model, which is something that you created. All of us have made this mistake at home or at work and usually in both arenas.

1811
02:53:47.20 --> 02:53:52.20
It's the easy way out, but it's not honorable, and it never works in the long run.

1812
02:53:52.20 --> 02:54:02.20
In uncomfortable situations, most people have a natural default to either dominate or withdraw based on their natural DNA.

1813
02:54:02.20 --> 02:54:15.20
Negative emotions, so that's like, you know, you get confronted. There's a plan that needs to be made. There's a scenario that's unfolding and what most people tend to do is either dominate or withdraw.

1814
02:54:15.20 --> 02:54:19.20
So something's getting uncomfortable to either dominate or withdraw depending on your DNA.

1815
02:54:19.20 --> 02:54:27.20
Negative emotions come from the limbic system of the brain that can be quick and strong, making it easy to go left or right side responses.

1816
02:54:27.20 --> 02:54:32.20
And you've got a chart here that I'm going to explain. Moving to the engage column.

1817
02:54:32.20 --> 02:54:37.20
So this is instead of trying to dominate or instead of withdrawing, what you want to do is you want to engage.

1818
02:54:37.20 --> 02:54:41.20
This is the engage column of this chart, which again, I'll describe in a second.

1819
02:54:41.20 --> 02:54:49.20
It requires you to slow down and use the prefrontal cortex of the brain to rationally consider the issues and what's at stake.

1820
02:54:49.20 --> 02:54:59.20
Engagement takes a willingness to respect, listen, share logic, discuss mindsets and stay engaged to work through a healthy solution.

1821
02:54:59.20 --> 02:55:04.20
Most of all, engagement requires setting aside or walking through your fears.

1822
02:55:04.20 --> 02:55:08.20
And that takes a great deal of courage.

1823
02:55:08.20 --> 02:55:14.20
And then you get into this chart that you've got here, the leadership engagement model.

1824
02:55:14.20 --> 02:55:17.20
So on the one side, you've got withdraw.

1825
02:55:17.20 --> 02:55:20.20
So this is an uncomfortable situation. This is how people respond.

1826
02:55:20.20 --> 02:55:30.20
One response that people have is to withdraw, which means they retreat, they hide, they avoid, they abandon, they quit, or they go passive aggressive.

1827
02:55:30.20 --> 02:55:40.20
The other side, the other extreme on this spectrum is to dominate, which is they control, they dictate, they force, they bully, they manipulate.

1828
02:55:40.20 --> 02:55:46.20
You've got a list of the emotions that kind of trigger these two responses and they're both the same.

1829
02:55:46.20 --> 02:55:53.20
Right. Right. Fear, anger, distrust, pride, ego, hubris, pessimism, shame, guilt, both those.

1830
02:55:53.20 --> 02:55:56.20
You got both those and both all those description, both those columns.

1831
02:55:56.20 --> 02:56:02.20
And you know, when some people are afraid, some people just hide, some people attack, right?

1832
02:56:02.20 --> 02:56:16.20
When people, when people's ego gets in the way, of course, some people, some people shy away or they turn people off, they don't say anything, or some people jump in and try and dominate.

1833
02:56:16.20 --> 02:56:29.20
The correct response here that you've got in the middle, which is engage, a balanced response, is believe, initiate, dialogue, clarify, connect, collaborate, celebrate.

1834
02:56:29.20 --> 02:56:37.20
And this is driven by the emotions of courage, of respect, love, trust, humility, optimism, self-respect, confidence.

1835
02:56:37.20 --> 02:56:46.20
So this is an important thing for us to think about, an important model for us to think about from this book.

1836
02:56:46.20 --> 02:56:50.20
Engage with honor is think about what you're doing when it's time to respond.

1837
02:56:50.20 --> 02:56:58.20
Are you responding out of fear? Are you responding out of anger? Are you retreating? Are you hiding? Are you avoiding?

1838
02:56:58.20 --> 02:57:01.20
Man, that avoid when people like that one, don't they?

1839
02:57:01.20 --> 02:57:05.20
I'm just going to avoid this problem. Pretend it doesn't exist. Hopefully it'll go away.

1840
02:57:05.20 --> 02:57:14.20
Or are you going to try and get in there and impose your plan, impose your will, and force things down people's throats? None of those are good.

1841
02:57:14.20 --> 02:57:24.20
And said, go on, talk to people, collaborate with them. So powerful stuff inside that book and a ton of other information.

1842
02:57:24.20 --> 02:57:34.20
I think you may have one of those. That's the courage card on one side, the courage challenge. And on the backside, it has the engage model that you were just talking about.

1843
02:57:34.20 --> 02:57:43.20
So that we give these out to our clients so that they can actually learn to coach themselves. Okay.

1844
02:57:43.20 --> 02:57:52.20
Yes, I was withdrawing there. I should have engaged. You know, we had one client, it was a large hospital.

1845
02:57:52.20 --> 02:58:05.20
And I at the workshop, we were offsite retreat and I said, okay, I want somebody to tell a story of how the hospital has done one or the other of these.

1846
02:58:05.20 --> 02:58:12.20
And so they thought about it for a minute and somebody says, well, you know, we're working with the doctors from that clinic over there.

1847
02:58:12.20 --> 02:58:18.20
We tried to dominate because we're the hospital and they're the doctors. And they withdrew.

1848
02:58:18.20 --> 02:58:25.20
And then a year later, they came back with something and they tried to dominate and we withdrew.

1849
02:58:25.20 --> 02:58:34.20
And what we needed to do was sit down and work through all that with them because they need us and we need them engage and work through it.

1850
02:58:34.20 --> 02:58:48.20
Again, maybe next time we'll go through that book and some of the leadership in that inside that book. But for now, that gets us up to date somewhat.

1851
02:58:48.20 --> 02:58:54.20
Where can people find you? Let's talk about that. I know you've got leadingwithhonor.com.

1852
02:58:54.20 --> 02:58:55.20
Yes.

1853
02:58:55.20 --> 02:59:00.20
So that's the main page for your consulting for your speaking. All that stuff can be found there.

1854
02:59:00.20 --> 02:59:01.20
Right.

1855
02:59:01.20 --> 02:59:04.20
You have an Instagram.

1856
02:59:04.20 --> 02:59:05.20
Yes.

1857
02:59:05.20 --> 02:59:14.20
Your Instagram is leadingwithhonor. You have a Twitter. So you're on social media. Leon Lee Ellis.

1858
02:59:14.20 --> 02:59:20.20
Facebook page. Leon in parentheses. Lee Ellis.

1859
02:59:20.20 --> 02:59:24.20
And then you LinkedIn. Lee Ellis came up pretty quick.

1860
02:59:24.20 --> 02:59:35.20
The books we talked about today, leadingwithhonor, both these books are available. We'll put them on our website so people can easily find them and link through.

1861
02:59:35.20 --> 02:59:40.20
I just gave Echo Charles who's sitting in the corner right now the look of confirmation.

1862
02:59:40.20 --> 02:59:51.20
There are times where I as a leader fail to correctly impose the idea that when we say something should be on the website, it should be on the website.

1863
02:59:51.20 --> 02:59:52.20
Oh, good.

1864
02:59:52.20 --> 03:00:00.20
So I think by the big affirmation, not I just got from Echo Charles, I think we should be good.

1865
03:00:00.20 --> 03:00:03.20
But that's where we can find you.

1866
03:00:03.20 --> 03:00:08.20
Yes. Thank you. And there are a lot of free tools on our website.

1867
03:00:08.20 --> 03:00:15.20
A lot of things, the things we're talked about here, the engage model and everything, those are all free on the website.

1868
03:00:15.20 --> 03:00:25.20
We even have one on voting and it's totally nonpolitical, but it's on how to think about who you're going to vote for and it emphasizes character.

1869
03:00:25.20 --> 03:00:30.20
But there's a few questions you can check off, but there's just a lot of free tools on there.

1870
03:00:30.20 --> 03:00:34.20
What kind of scores are our politicians getting on the character right now?

1871
03:00:34.20 --> 03:00:41.20
Are we talking about the point, the guy that scored a point zero one beats the guy that scored a point zero zero one?

1872
03:00:41.20 --> 03:00:51.20
You know, I think politicians get very insecure when they're afraid that somebody's going to publicize something negative about them and then they fight.

1873
03:00:51.20 --> 03:01:02.20
And when, you know, talking about character earlier, once you step over the line and do something that you're not proud of, then you have to cover it up, especially if you're a politician.

1874
03:01:02.20 --> 03:01:10.20
And so you start covering up and then you do something that covering up causes more and it just cascades really.

1875
03:01:10.20 --> 03:01:15.20
That's why when you mess something up, you say, Hey, this is what I just messed up.

1876
03:01:15.20 --> 03:01:16.20
Exactly.

1877
03:01:16.20 --> 03:01:17.20
This is my mistake.

1878
03:01:17.20 --> 03:01:18.20
Here's what I was thinking.

1879
03:01:18.20 --> 03:01:19.20
Here's why I did it.

1880
03:01:19.20 --> 03:01:20.20
It wasn't right.

1881
03:01:20.20 --> 03:01:24.20
Dave, what do you got for questions?

1882
03:01:24.20 --> 03:01:26.20
You've been you've been quiet over there.

1883
03:01:26.20 --> 03:01:28.20
At least I know.

1884
03:01:28.20 --> 03:01:30.20
Let's get an F4 phantom question.

1885
03:01:30.20 --> 03:01:31.20
Come on.

1886
03:01:31.20 --> 03:01:33.20
I don't have any questions.

1887
03:01:33.20 --> 03:01:37.20
It's it's actually very easy to be quiet when I'm listening to you tell your story.

1888
03:01:37.20 --> 03:01:45.20
So please don't take my lack of verbal engagement as anything other than just being really captivated.

1889
03:01:45.20 --> 03:01:53.20
And this is by the second time in a couple months, I've had a chance to sit here and talk to a fighter pilot.

1890
03:01:53.20 --> 03:01:54.20
Tell his story.

1891
03:01:54.20 --> 03:01:57.20
We listened to bud, buddy Anderson a couple months back.

1892
03:01:57.20 --> 03:02:06.20
And then of course now you and what I've been thinking about more than anything is it's just it's so remarkable to me that you're you're talking about these names.

1893
03:02:06.20 --> 03:02:19.20
And as as a naval aviator, you know, McCain, those names like that, you know, Stockdale, they're just they're just in the vernacular.

1894
03:02:19.20 --> 03:02:21.20
There's just the names that naval aviation knows.

1895
03:02:21.20 --> 03:02:29.20
I have a picture from my T2 Buckeye intermediate jet training class sitting on the wing of the exact same T2 Buckeye that John McCain sat on as an ensign.

1896
03:02:29.20 --> 03:02:46.20
But when you talk about Lance Seidgen, Robbie Reisner, and if you have any connection to the Air Force, which I was very fortunate growing up to have a connection and didn't exchange with the Air Force, those names are the same names for the Air Force as the ones I talked about on the Navy.

1897
03:02:46.20 --> 03:02:50.20
But those were the I only knew them from books.

1898
03:02:50.20 --> 03:03:00.20
I only knew them from war and from stories and to hear you talk about them in a way that really humanizes them because you didn't read about them.

1899
03:03:00.20 --> 03:03:11.20
You didn't hear about them that you actually knew them has been just incredibly, incredibly powerful for me because those guys shaped what I did in my life.

1900
03:03:11.20 --> 03:03:14.20
But I was removed from them because they were just they weren't even people.

1901
03:03:14.20 --> 03:03:18.20
They were just put up on a pedestal like they were they were elevated above there.

1902
03:03:18.20 --> 03:03:33.20
But to hear you talk about that, I hope you take a little bit of I hope you take some pride in knowing that there's an opportunity now for a whole other generation of people and the thousands upon thousands of people are going to listen to this podcast and hear those names are going to Google them.

1903
03:03:33.20 --> 03:03:34.20
They're going to look them up.

1904
03:03:34.20 --> 03:03:43.20
They're going to read those books, thoughts of a philosophical fighter pilot, those type of books and then hear about what Lance Seidgen did to earn the Medal of Honor.

1905
03:03:43.20 --> 03:03:48.20
They get to they get to do to another group of people that they did to me.

1906
03:03:48.20 --> 03:03:54.20
And I think the reason that happened is because I got to sit here and listen to you tell that story and tell those stories of them.

1907
03:03:54.20 --> 03:03:56.20
So thanks for letting me be part of this.

1908
03:03:56.20 --> 03:03:57.20
Thank you.

1909
03:03:57.20 --> 03:03:58.20
Incredible.

1910
03:03:58.20 --> 03:03:59.20
Thank you Dave.

1911
03:03:59.20 --> 03:04:12.20
I those guys inspired me to they were they were exceptional people because going back to things some of the things that joccos been talking about was they believed in themselves.

1912
03:04:12.20 --> 03:04:17.20
And they weren't afraid to they weren't afraid of failing.

1913
03:04:17.20 --> 03:04:21.20
They knew they were committed to what they were doing.

1914
03:04:21.20 --> 03:04:28.20
They stayed with it and did the best they could and they did not worry about what somebody else would think or anything like that.

1915
03:04:28.20 --> 03:04:30.20
They just did their best.

1916
03:04:30.20 --> 03:04:39.20
And that's what made them so special to us and everybody else and their rewards and you know that they rise.

1917
03:04:39.20 --> 03:04:46.20
I said would have won a Medal of Honor also but they'd already given two or three out to POWs and they didn't want to give any more.

1918
03:04:46.20 --> 03:04:49.20
But he should have probably have had one to the Silver Star.

1919
03:04:49.20 --> 03:04:56.20
But those they were amazing inspirational Lance was an inspiring teammate.

1920
03:04:56.20 --> 03:04:58.20
We play golf together and dating girls together.

1921
03:04:58.20 --> 03:05:01.20
But I always kind of looked up to him.

1922
03:05:01.20 --> 03:05:07.20
You know when we you brought up Lance and you talked about Lance but we weren't on the podcast.

1923
03:05:07.20 --> 03:05:14.20
Can you can you go through again you know your your experiences with Lance and and what happened with him.

1924
03:05:14.20 --> 03:05:20.20
Well we connected in survival school right after we got our wings.

1925
03:05:20.20 --> 03:05:33.20
We were signed F4 pipeline Southeast Asia both of us were and our first next assignment was to Fairchild Air Force Base to survival school up in Washington and we went there and went through that.

1926
03:05:33.20 --> 03:05:53.20
And I watched him in class and out in the field as we were going through and Lance was paying so much attention carefully and asking questions in class and he sat on the front row and he was so focused on that survival training because he knew we're going to war and should be important.

1927
03:05:53.20 --> 03:05:55.20
Well I was too but not as much as he was.

1928
03:05:55.20 --> 03:06:03.20
And then we got to know each other and start playing golf together and dating girls together and partying together and that sort of thing.

1929
03:06:03.20 --> 03:06:14.20
We went to war together on a chartered flight from San Francisco over to the Philippines and as quick as we got leveled off and they fed us and all that.

1930
03:06:14.20 --> 03:06:20.20
Lance and I went back to the back and met the two flight met two of the flight attendants and got dates with them.

1931
03:06:20.20 --> 03:06:30.20
Okay. And if you read the book about him the mile into the mouth of the cat that girl in there is the one that we met and I still keep in touch with her.

1932
03:06:30.20 --> 03:06:45.20
But in the period in the situation when his airplane went down and lost he evaded capture for 4043 days or so and was dying.

1933
03:06:45.20 --> 03:06:53.20
No food just eating bugs and leaves and that sort of thing and his back was broken so he couldn't stand up.

1934
03:06:53.20 --> 03:06:57.20
He was crawling backwards and he had a skull that was bashed open.

1935
03:06:57.20 --> 03:07:09.20
So incredible courage and then tried to escape and he was just an amazing guy that did everything he could to be the soldier he was committed to be.

1936
03:07:09.20 --> 03:07:15.20
And so that was and a really good guy came from a really good home.

1937
03:07:15.20 --> 03:07:26.20
You know I think the one thing I want to say on this podcast because it's so important Lance grew up in a family where his father he and his father had a great relationship.

1938
03:07:26.20 --> 03:07:30.20
His mother and father he had a great relationship with both of them.

1939
03:07:30.20 --> 03:07:35.20
He had a lot of unconditional love Lance was an artist.

1940
03:07:35.20 --> 03:07:43.20
And a fighter hand to hand combat type fighter and an artist and a football player and a fighter pilot.

1941
03:07:43.20 --> 03:07:56.20
But he was incredibly gifted artist and he was an actor he played in high school he played in the the great king of Siam or whatever in one of those plays.

1942
03:07:56.20 --> 03:08:07.20
He was so incredibly adaptable and so talented in so many areas but he had incredible amount of unconditional love from his father and his mother.

1943
03:08:07.20 --> 03:08:22.20
He had very little insecurity from shame or guilt from growing up and as a parent the more that you can provide that to your child the healthier they're going to be the tougher they're going to be in battle.

1944
03:08:22.20 --> 03:08:28.20
And the more forgiving and accepting of others they will be it's just a healthier person.

1945
03:08:28.20 --> 03:08:42.20
So to me that's one of the most important lessons I've learned in all of my POW experience my leadership is that help people be more healthy believing themselves so they'll be more healthy.

1946
03:08:42.20 --> 03:08:49.20
And they're going to be better performers at work they're going to be better people at home they're going to be better parents and that sort of thing.

1947
03:08:49.20 --> 03:08:55.20
And you two ended up in prison camp together but you didn't know it.

1948
03:08:55.20 --> 03:08:56.20
I didn't know it was him.

1949
03:08:56.20 --> 03:08:58.20
So what was that experience.

1950
03:08:58.20 --> 03:09:07.20
Well we were both in the Hanoi Hilton there in the same cell block and I didn't know he had been shot down he went down two days after me.

1951
03:09:07.20 --> 03:09:13.20
And he was about 30 or 40 feet away in another cell with two other guys.

1952
03:09:13.20 --> 03:09:20.20
And he was delirious he started screaming and it was obvious he was delirious because you weren't supposed to make any noise.

1953
03:09:20.20 --> 03:09:26.20
They'd come in and beat you up but they knew he was delirious and badly wounded and injured.

1954
03:09:26.20 --> 03:09:35.20
So they didn't come in and beat him up but they tried to quieten him down but the English speaker came by checking on all the other cells in there to see what everything going OK.

1955
03:09:35.20 --> 03:09:43.20
And he opened our cell and I said why don't you help that man who has a problem sounds like he needs some help.

1956
03:09:43.20 --> 03:09:50.20
And the English speaker said to me had been in jungle long time have one foot in grave.

1957
03:09:50.20 --> 03:09:59.20
And I did not know it was Lance for two years that they was talking about he died two days later.

1958
03:09:59.20 --> 03:10:06.20
Any other closing thoughts Lee.

1959
03:10:06.20 --> 03:10:21.20
There are some great lessons that we learned in the POW camp that apply to love and marriage and so I've just finished a new book called Captured by Love inspiring true romance stories from Vietnam POWs.

1960
03:10:21.20 --> 03:10:29.20
And we have a website POW romance dot com and it'll be out there where you could sign up to learn about it.

1961
03:10:29.20 --> 03:10:41.20
But we have 20 stories of guys who are POWs more than five years two of them more than eight years several of them six or seven years who have had incredible love stories.

1962
03:10:41.20 --> 03:10:50.20
And the romance is in there but the love is there and at the end of each chapter the chapter is about nine or 10 pages long end of each story.

1963
03:10:50.20 --> 03:11:06.20
And we have some love lessons and but those love lessons of commitment of caring were some of the same lessons that helped us survive five six seven eight years as POWs.

1964
03:11:06.20 --> 03:11:11.20
It's amazing how similar those lessons are.

1965
03:11:11.20 --> 03:11:15.20
When you know the broad the when you know the way broadly you see it in all things.

1966
03:11:15.20 --> 03:11:18.20
So these lessons apply everywhere.

1967
03:11:18.20 --> 03:11:21.20
Well thank you so much.

1968
03:11:21.20 --> 03:11:23.20
Thank you for coming on.

1969
03:11:23.20 --> 03:11:25.20
Thanks for your service.

1970
03:11:25.20 --> 03:11:27.20
Thanks for your sacrifice.

1971
03:11:27.20 --> 03:11:31.20
Just unbelievable what what you all went through.

1972
03:11:31.20 --> 03:11:36.20
Thanks for continuing to pass these lessons on these leadership lessons on.

1973
03:11:36.20 --> 03:11:43.20
I want to close with a section of your book that so so to set the stage.

1974
03:11:43.20 --> 03:11:54.20
You get back home your your getting your life and your career back on track and that meant flying again meant flying again.

1975
03:11:54.20 --> 03:11:58.20
And so you wrote about what that was like.

1976
03:11:58.20 --> 03:12:00.20
I'm going to take it to the book to close this thing out.

1977
03:12:00.20 --> 03:12:05.20
You say like most of the POWs I had decided to continue my career in the service.

1978
03:12:05.20 --> 03:12:13.20
The Air Force had instituted a plan called Operation Homecoming to re qualify returning pilots.

1979
03:12:13.20 --> 03:12:24.20
So on August 7th 1973 under the watchful eye of my instructor pilot I launched a T 38 out of Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio.

1980
03:12:24.20 --> 03:12:34.20
As we cleared the end of the runway I rotated the white rocket into a max climb pressed the mic button and made the call to the tower.

1981
03:12:34.20 --> 03:12:38.20
Freedom 34 airborne.

1982
03:12:38.20 --> 03:12:41.20
This captive was really free.

1983
03:12:41.20 --> 03:12:46.20
I had slipped the surly bonds of earth once more.

1984
03:12:46.20 --> 03:12:51.20
That's freedom sir.

1985
03:12:51.20 --> 03:12:52.20
Thank you Chaco.

1986
03:12:52.20 --> 03:12:53.20
Thank you for having me on.

1987
03:12:53.20 --> 03:12:57.20
It's been wonderful to be with you and Dave and to meet that go here.

1988
03:12:57.20 --> 03:13:06.20
And I appreciate what you're doing to help all of us think about leadership about service and about just being good humans.

1989
03:13:06.20 --> 03:13:09.20
So thank you guys for what you're doing.

1990
03:13:09.20 --> 03:13:10.20
It's an honor sir.

1991
03:13:10.20 --> 03:13:12.20
Thank you.

1992
03:13:12.20 --> 03:13:14.20
And with that.

1993
03:13:14.20 --> 03:13:18.20
Lee Ellis has left the building.

1994
03:13:18.20 --> 03:13:33.20
And once again we can look at our lives and see how ridiculously lucky and blessed we are to be doing whatever it is we're doing.

1995
03:13:33.20 --> 03:13:35.20
Yes.

1996
03:13:35.20 --> 03:13:42.20
And I mean I mean how much I'm going through the book like what part of my going to actually read right.

1997
03:13:42.20 --> 03:13:44.20
There's so much in there to read.

1998
03:13:44.20 --> 03:13:54.20
And it's all just overcoming the worst possible challenges on a day.

1999
03:13:54.20 --> 03:13:56.20
You know we barely even talked about.

2000
03:13:56.20 --> 03:13:59.20
I mean I put I read a little bit.

2001
03:13:59.20 --> 03:14:07.20
You know you're you're on a trip and you didn't bring any food.

2002
03:14:07.20 --> 03:14:13.20
And so it's been like nine hours since you ate and you're all bummed out.

2003
03:14:13.20 --> 03:14:14.20
Yeah.

2004
03:14:14.20 --> 03:14:15.20
You know what I'm saying.

2005
03:14:15.20 --> 03:14:16.20
Yeah.

2006
03:14:16.20 --> 03:14:23.20
Or or you go like hey we were on a road trip and we're driving and we pull over.

2007
03:14:23.20 --> 03:14:24.20
There's no food anywhere.

2008
03:14:24.20 --> 03:14:28.20
So we finally pull over like a rest stop and they got a bunch of junk and you're mad.

2009
03:14:28.20 --> 03:14:29.20
Right.

2010
03:14:29.20 --> 03:14:31.20
Yeah.

2011
03:14:31.20 --> 03:14:42.20
Dude we're talking five and a half years of like a little piece of bread with with bugs in it.

2012
03:14:42.20 --> 03:14:43.20
Yeah.

2013
03:14:43.20 --> 03:14:44.20
That's every day.

2014
03:14:44.20 --> 03:14:45.20
That's what you're getting.

2015
03:14:45.20 --> 03:14:47.20
That's what you're getting.

2016
03:14:47.20 --> 03:14:48.20
Yeah.

2017
03:14:48.20 --> 03:14:50.20
We barely even talked about that.

2018
03:14:50.20 --> 03:14:51.20
Yeah.

2019
03:14:51.20 --> 03:14:54.20
It's insane.

2020
03:14:54.20 --> 03:14:55.20
Yeah.

2021
03:14:55.20 --> 03:14:58.20
Not to mention just all the little details we take for granted where you know how he's

2022
03:14:58.20 --> 03:15:00.20
like oh I really wanted those socks.

2023
03:15:00.20 --> 03:15:01.20
Yeah.

2024
03:15:01.20 --> 03:15:02.20
Yeah.

2025
03:15:02.20 --> 03:15:03.20
But you ever tried a pair of socks.

2026
03:15:03.20 --> 03:15:07.20
I mean one pair of socks coming from is different than coming from you.

2027
03:15:07.20 --> 03:15:10.20
But I was going to ask you ever try sleep when your feet are cold.

2028
03:15:10.20 --> 03:15:13.20
And you can't get.

2029
03:15:13.20 --> 03:15:18.20
I know wrong crowd but I'm just saying most of us.

2030
03:15:18.20 --> 03:15:19.20
She is hard.

2031
03:15:19.20 --> 03:15:20.20
Can be.

2032
03:15:20.20 --> 03:15:23.20
I'm just saying in our daily lives today.

2033
03:15:23.20 --> 03:15:27.20
But yeah he you know he barely mentioned that or whatever but consider all that put together.

2034
03:15:27.20 --> 03:15:29.20
You know and not to mention the stuff he didn't mention.

2035
03:15:29.20 --> 03:15:30.20
Yeah.

2036
03:15:30.20 --> 03:15:31.20
By the way.

2037
03:15:31.20 --> 03:15:32.20
But it's like okay your feet are cold.

2038
03:15:32.20 --> 03:15:33.20
You can't sleep.

2039
03:15:33.20 --> 03:15:34.20
You don't have any food.

2040
03:15:34.20 --> 03:15:37.20
The food that you do have is bugs in it.

2041
03:15:37.20 --> 03:15:39.20
That's your baseline.

2042
03:15:39.20 --> 03:15:40.20
Yeah.

2043
03:15:40.20 --> 03:15:41.20
On top of that you're getting tortured.

2044
03:15:41.20 --> 03:15:42.20
You may get killed.

2045
03:15:42.20 --> 03:15:43.20
You may get disintery.

2046
03:15:43.20 --> 03:15:44.20
All these things are going on.

2047
03:15:44.20 --> 03:15:46.20
You may have a bomb dropped on you.

2048
03:15:46.20 --> 03:15:47.20
Yeah.

2049
03:15:47.20 --> 03:15:48.20
An American bomb.

2050
03:15:48.20 --> 03:15:49.20
Yeah.

2051
03:15:49.20 --> 03:15:50.20
Right.

2052
03:15:50.20 --> 03:15:53.20
And for you're going at this for five and a half years.

2053
03:15:53.20 --> 03:15:55.20
The keeping the pot.

2054
03:15:55.20 --> 03:16:01.60
This is what this is where I started like assessing myself in this as I was reading this is I'm

2055
03:16:01.60 --> 03:16:06.20
just thinking I just am slacking in like nine different categories.

2056
03:16:06.20 --> 03:16:07.20
Unappreciated.

2057
03:16:07.20 --> 03:16:08.20
You know what I mean.

2058
03:16:08.20 --> 03:16:09.20
Yeah.

2059
03:16:09.20 --> 03:16:15.52
These guys are putting through such effort to improve themselves in a prison camp.

2060
03:16:15.52 --> 03:16:19.40
They're trying to learn a new language in a prison camp.

2061
03:16:19.40 --> 03:16:20.40
They don't have food.

2062
03:16:20.40 --> 03:16:26.52
Like I'm mad because you know I didn't my my my my steak isn't ready yet.

2063
03:16:26.52 --> 03:16:29.12
I'm kind of mad about that.

2064
03:16:29.12 --> 03:16:37.24
My rib eye steak is not you know the when I got home my rib eye wasn't fully defrosted.

2065
03:16:37.24 --> 03:16:41.56
So I'm going to have to like eat something else besides a rib eye steak tonight and I'm

2066
03:16:41.56 --> 03:16:43.68
mad about it.

2067
03:16:43.68 --> 03:16:51.56
Meanwhile these guys are in a prison camp and they're making courses to learn and improve

2068
03:16:51.56 --> 03:16:56.000
themselves as they're resisting and fighting.

2069
03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:59.12
I like that little thing I talked about like scaling the victories.

2070
03:16:59.12 --> 03:17:00.36
That's a good thing to do with life.

2071
03:17:00.36 --> 03:17:01.36
Yeah.

2072
03:17:01.36 --> 03:17:04.64
You know you got to scale your victories.

2073
03:17:04.64 --> 03:17:07.36
So we're lucky.

2074
03:17:07.36 --> 03:17:09.36
We're lucky.

2075
03:17:09.36 --> 03:17:16.68
Hey what is what is so I keep out of get these mixed up which what's negative G's versus

2076
03:17:16.68 --> 03:17:19.36
G's in the plane.

2077
03:17:19.36 --> 03:17:20.36
Negative G's is floating.

2078
03:17:20.36 --> 03:17:21.36
Oh OK.

2079
03:17:21.36 --> 03:17:30.20
So like if you're OK so you know when they film movies some movies and they want to do

2080
03:17:30.20 --> 03:17:35.000
like a gra- you know think it's straight up your feet cold.

2081
03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.28
I'm going to do some turmoil over it.

2082
03:17:37.28 --> 03:17:40.20
But you know they want to do a zero gravity scenario.

2083
03:17:40.20 --> 03:17:43.88
So they go on a big plane and they make that kind of the recording place and then they

2084
03:17:43.88 --> 03:17:46.80
do a parabola is what they call it right.

2085
03:17:46.80 --> 03:17:48.64
So that's a negative G's scenario.

2086
03:17:48.64 --> 03:17:50.12
Yeah you got it.

2087
03:17:50.12 --> 03:17:51.12
Gotcha.

2088
03:17:51.12 --> 03:17:54.88
And then G's is obviously the pre- 18 G's in the injection sheet Dave.

2089
03:17:54.88 --> 03:17:56.84
18 G's something like that something crazy.

2090
03:17:56.84 --> 03:18:00.52
You know it's obviously a relatively short period of time but yeah it's like a massive

2091
03:18:00.52 --> 03:18:04.36
amount of initial onset G. If you eject once I heard you're grounded for life.

2092
03:18:04.36 --> 03:18:05.36
Is that true or not.

2093
03:18:05.36 --> 03:18:06.36
No not true.

2094
03:18:06.36 --> 03:18:08.04
What about two ejections.

2095
03:18:08.04 --> 03:18:11.92
I don't actually know the to my knowledge I don't think there's anything that says you're

2096
03:18:11.92 --> 03:18:13.52
automatically grounded.

2097
03:18:13.52 --> 03:18:19.32
I imagine a second ejection you're going to get a pretty thorough physical but I knew

2098
03:18:19.32 --> 03:18:21.92
a decent number of guys that ejected and went back to airplanes.

2099
03:18:21.92 --> 03:18:24.96
When you thought about grabbing your ejection handle what was the scenario.

2100
03:18:24.96 --> 03:18:27.84
Yeah I mean that's a pretty fleeting thought.

2101
03:18:27.84 --> 03:18:30.84
I'm in a dive.

2102
03:18:30.84 --> 03:18:34.80
I'm doing I think I'm doing like just some what I would consider like basic dumb bomb

2103
03:18:34.80 --> 03:18:38.84
dropping bombs at 45 degree dive you're probably going on 350 knots something like that.

2104
03:18:38.84 --> 03:18:39.84
Where were you Iraq.

2105
03:18:39.84 --> 03:18:41.32
No no no this is in training.

2106
03:18:41.32 --> 03:18:45.16
This is in training here like in Southern California.

2107
03:18:45.16 --> 03:18:47.32
And Iraq I'm guessing.

2108
03:18:47.32 --> 03:18:50.04
Come on dude.

2109
03:18:50.04 --> 03:18:52.64
I get what's called a flight control problem.

2110
03:18:52.64 --> 03:18:56.52
So I get like a D. D. D. like the jet starts making these weird noises and I get this thing

2111
03:18:56.52 --> 03:19:00.32
that lights up and I get this little code that says F. C. S. caution which means my flight

2112
03:19:00.32 --> 03:19:04.40
controls as I pull back in the stick like for a second nothing happens.

2113
03:19:04.40 --> 03:19:08.80
This digital flight control thing I'm like whoa I pulled back and like the jet didn't

2114
03:19:08.80 --> 03:19:13.48
respond for probably a very short period of time and in that moment you have these thoughts

2115
03:19:13.48 --> 03:19:16.68
of like OK this isn't good and you're in a dive.

2116
03:19:16.68 --> 03:19:18.52
I'm in a dive was altitude.

2117
03:19:18.52 --> 03:19:25.76
I would say probably 6000 feet and I can't do the I can't exactly remember the math but

2118
03:19:25.76 --> 03:19:32.28
I bet you you're you're your rate of descent you know is is not long 10s of thousands feet

2119
03:19:32.28 --> 03:19:33.28
per minute.

2120
03:19:33.28 --> 03:19:35.76
So you've got you know probably a handful of seconds maybe 20 seconds or something before

2121
03:19:35.76 --> 03:19:37.84
you literally were to get hit the ground.

2122
03:19:37.84 --> 03:19:40.88
And in that moment of hey I pull back nothing happens.

2123
03:19:40.88 --> 03:19:44.64
I need to think about what are my options are you run through a few one of them is I need

2124
03:19:44.64 --> 03:19:47.08
to I might need to get out of the airplane.

2125
03:19:47.08 --> 03:19:51.44
And then I think a very short period of time you know a button you hit and then the plane

2126
03:19:51.44 --> 03:19:55.40
is fine you and it ends up being totally uneventful.

2127
03:19:55.40 --> 03:20:00.24
But when you make a consideration of doing that it's a it's a significant event in your

2128
03:20:00.24 --> 03:20:02.44
mind of having to think should I do this.

2129
03:20:02.44 --> 03:20:06.24
Did you get a little adrenaline rush down your arms like when you almost crash a car.

2130
03:20:06.24 --> 03:20:10.40
Totally you feel it like I guess as I'm talking to the story I think I remember I feel it

2131
03:20:10.40 --> 03:20:15.40
in my chest more than anything like a tightening or some some you know I guess it's almost

2132
03:20:15.40 --> 03:20:21.80
like an exhilaration or something anxious but dude like I said man I almost don't even

2133
03:20:21.80 --> 03:20:26.24
want to tell a story after listening to what he's talking about not to mention to I didn't

2134
03:20:26.24 --> 03:20:31.96
fully in reading the book I wasn't able to piece together what what happened until he

2135
03:20:31.96 --> 03:20:32.96
explained it.

2136
03:20:32.96 --> 03:20:33.96
No I wasn't either.

2137
03:20:33.96 --> 03:20:40.48
And to be honest with you like my pilot brain like this this doesn't fully make sense to

2138
03:20:40.48 --> 03:20:45.16
me not that I've known was like to get shot down I'm talking about why do the like why

2139
03:20:45.16 --> 03:20:48.96
the airplane did that really didn't make sense because I know a lot about triple A I've seen

2140
03:20:48.96 --> 03:20:54.64
a bunch of videos we study that stuff and how the airplanes react to that is like didn't

2141
03:20:54.64 --> 03:20:55.64
make sense.

2142
03:20:55.64 --> 03:21:00.04
The other thing is what didn't make sense to me was like Charlie Plum talking about you

2143
03:21:00.04 --> 03:21:02.68
can see the surface to air missiles coming at you.

2144
03:21:02.68 --> 03:21:04.60
Yeah said it looked like a telephone pole.

2145
03:21:04.60 --> 03:21:08.28
Yes and you're like looking at it going oh no it's going to hit us because I was going

2146
03:21:08.28 --> 03:21:12.24
to ask him you know in boxing they say it's the punch that you don't see that knocks you

2147
03:21:12.24 --> 03:21:16.40
out and I was like did you not see this thing and then he explained what happened it's like

2148
03:21:16.40 --> 03:21:17.88
oh dang.

2149
03:21:17.88 --> 03:21:22.16
Sam's are totally different story too this is a big giant missile going to you know mock

2150
03:21:22.16 --> 03:21:28.04
a couple and they blow up like they literally are designed to explode triple A doesn't do

2151
03:21:28.04 --> 03:21:32.64
that they're just bullets I mean they don't have really so when he explained it he did

2152
03:21:32.64 --> 03:21:35.84
it well like bullet goes through your wing maybe it hits a hydraulic line or goes through

2153
03:21:35.84 --> 03:21:40.28
your engine but you're not going to just instantly detonate in cartwheel you're going to you're

2154
03:21:40.28 --> 03:21:43.76
probably going to pull out of it and go dang something's wrong some indicators will pop

2155
03:21:43.76 --> 03:21:49.48
up the jet might start to deteriorate over time maybe seconds or minutes but the scenario

2156
03:21:49.48 --> 03:21:55.76
of being in a dive being shot at by bullets and then just like literally up until sitting

2157
03:21:55.76 --> 03:22:00.16
here listening to explain it I never fully piece that together in my head in fact the

2158
03:22:00.16 --> 03:22:03.48
pilot was like I don't understand and I wasn't going to ask him like can you explain this

2159
03:22:03.48 --> 03:22:08.52
better because I couldn't follow it when he explained the fuse the FMU he called it which

2160
03:22:08.52 --> 03:22:12.08
I think is like fuse mechanical unit literally just the thing that detonates the bomb as

2161
03:22:12.08 --> 03:22:17.12
soon as he said that it all made sense like a bomb literally blew up underneath his jet

2162
03:22:17.12 --> 03:22:20.72
he probably had a string of bombs probably picture two or three in a row like the old

2163
03:22:20.72 --> 03:22:24.64
videos of bombs coming out the bottom bomb blows up blows up the next bomb blows up the

2164
03:22:24.64 --> 03:22:30.12
next bomb probably a hundred feet away from his jet or less literally blows up his airplane

2165
03:22:30.12 --> 03:22:36.72
from the bombs detonating and he's talking about tumbling that makes so much more sense

2166
03:22:36.72 --> 03:22:41.48
and it's heartbreaking to think that in the end he actually didn't get shot down that

2167
03:22:41.48 --> 03:22:46.16
clarified why it was such a catastrophic event requiring him to get out of the airplane

2168
03:22:46.16 --> 03:22:53.08
so quickly with such this catastrophic series of failures hearing him explain it made it

2169
03:22:53.08 --> 03:22:57.84
all make sense in my mind and it sucks because you know obviously you can't predict the future

2170
03:22:57.84 --> 03:23:02.08
but yeah were you tracking how long it took me to understand I was like wait a second

2171
03:23:02.08 --> 03:23:06.84
we were there together you know I might have I know kind of a little bit of terminology

2172
03:23:06.84 --> 03:23:10.48
of FMU and like oh yeah I got that and I you know probably studied some of the I was like

2173
03:23:10.48 --> 03:23:15.32
wait wait what's FMU yeah he's like and yeah of course I understand that stuff maybe a

2174
03:23:15.32 --> 03:23:19.32
little bit better but in the end like I'm there with you and go and once it registered

2175
03:23:19.32 --> 03:23:25.76
I go oh dang and why it's so heartbreaking is that you know this pilot or not the water

2176
03:23:25.76 --> 03:23:30.64
is home get me to the water and as he is he's seeing the ocean like in your brain as a pilot

2177
03:23:30.64 --> 03:23:34.76
or anything especially in our service yeah get me to the water I'll be okay I'll just

2178
03:23:34.76 --> 03:23:38.08
hang out there until somebody picks me up and oh we're cool especially you're down in

2179
03:23:38.08 --> 03:23:43.60
this in in southeast Asia the water's gonna be warm you know like I got this and if you

2180
03:23:43.60 --> 03:23:47.92
tell me the the water and I think he said a couple miles away a couple miles bro that's

2181
03:23:47.92 --> 03:23:52.72
literally seconds seconds it's not a couple miles of walking it's in an airplane it's

2182
03:23:52.72 --> 03:23:58.12
like thousand one thousand two yes eject now I'm good yeah it and if you're if you got

2183
03:23:58.12 --> 03:24:03.36
hit by triple a in your jets what we call it kind of like kind of falling apart underneath

2184
03:24:03.36 --> 03:24:09.48
you you're like hey man buckle up dude we got about 30 seconds you're gonna be fine

2185
03:24:09.48 --> 03:24:14.36
so the fact that it was catastrophic and had no choice that was the difference it would

2186
03:24:14.36 --> 03:24:17.32
have been better had he been shot down by triple a because he probably could have just

2187
03:24:17.32 --> 03:24:22.36
pulled the thing out waffled up motor shuts down catches on fire he's talking to the guy

2188
03:24:22.36 --> 03:24:28.68
you get 30 seconds you're fine obviously that didn't happen but I did not follow that series

2189
03:24:28.68 --> 03:24:32.80
events from the book until he explained it and then and then it's just awful and it happened

2190
03:24:32.80 --> 03:24:38.88
to a bunch of people and he's telling that I had I had never I had never heard those

2191
03:24:38.88 --> 03:24:43.84
I did not know that was the face in my nope did not know that from you know early fandom

2192
03:24:43.84 --> 03:24:49.40
days mid to late 60s big cover up that fuses predates anything I ever flew with you know

2193
03:24:49.40 --> 03:24:54.52
our fuses were super reliable we knew how to program they worked awesome I don't think

2194
03:24:54.52 --> 03:25:02.28
I ever once heard a story of a fuse prematurely detonating a weapon that we lost an airplane

2195
03:25:02.28 --> 03:25:06.08
we had you know different mechanical failures here and there but nothing like that certainly

2196
03:25:06.08 --> 03:25:12.92
not an endemic thing where multiple airplanes were lost as a result it's awful sucks you

2197
03:25:12.92 --> 03:25:18.000
know I noticed remember the thing was on the ground podcast we were talking about somebody

2198
03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:23.52
is using the terms putting hands on yeah yeah like I'm gonna put hands on them yeah and it's

2199
03:25:23.52 --> 03:25:31.68
sort of a it's does that remind you of when Dave says get out of the airplane yes like

2200
03:25:31.68 --> 03:25:37.48
it's like the lingo that kind of down plays it like but it's still kind of like badass

2201
03:25:37.48 --> 03:25:41.88
at the same time you're like wait a second like I might have to get out of the airplane

2202
03:25:41.88 --> 03:25:48.96
yeah yeah I think it yeah very similar you know put hands on yeah so there what's what's

2203
03:25:48.96 --> 03:25:52.04
put hands on putting hands on someone is like dude I was you know this guy was getting my

2204
03:25:52.04 --> 03:25:56.52
face I had to put hands on the way of saying it instead of just saying like I had to knock

2205
03:25:56.52 --> 03:26:00.84
this dude out or whatever instead of you just saying like oh you know you got to be like

2206
03:26:00.84 --> 03:26:04.48
you know you might have to get out of the airplane whatever right you guys always say that kind

2207
03:26:04.48 --> 03:26:09.52
of stuff too though but like what give him rounds down range yeah that's like I'm probably

2208
03:26:09.52 --> 03:26:14.96
just like so guilty of like 47 different little statements like that but didn't even until

2209
03:26:14.96 --> 03:26:19.44
you brought it up I was recounting when did I say that that's how you say it so it didn't

2210
03:26:19.44 --> 03:26:24.04
even cross my mind that that was a thing but yeah put it around down range yep that's

2211
03:26:24.04 --> 03:26:29.96
what we're doing or even even even contact when you say we can't or the enemy contacted

2212
03:26:29.96 --> 03:26:38.40
us or whatever yeah probably totally attacked you guys with like guns yeah that's more big

2213
03:26:38.40 --> 03:26:43.60
deal yeah well then it turns into what Dave's talking about cuz like you are so that's your

2214
03:26:43.60 --> 03:26:47.28
vote your your fur there's not there's no translation you're just like oh enemy contact

2215
03:26:47.28 --> 03:26:51.56
yeah that's what it's called it's yeah and it seems like even that get out of the airplane

2216
03:26:51.56 --> 03:26:54.80
it kind of seems like hey let's not make it it's a huge deal we all know that already

2217
03:26:54.80 --> 03:27:00.20
but let's not make it a huge deal kind of a thing and think about it that so we can navigate

2218
03:27:00.20 --> 03:27:03.84
through the scenario same saying it's almost like it's on purpose yeah just he just gets

2219
03:27:03.84 --> 03:27:07.20
out just so everyone else getting out of the airplane is what you should do when you land

2220
03:27:07.20 --> 03:27:12.76
it hey I'm good now I'm gonna get out of the airplane all right it's like the most nonchalant

2221
03:27:12.76 --> 03:27:17.92
pilot thing to be like oh I'm at I'm at 6,000 feet closing with the earth I'm going 500

2222
03:27:17.92 --> 03:27:24.08
knots I'm gonna get out of here just gonna get out of the airplane not like you know

2223
03:27:24.08 --> 03:27:28.24
which is what it really is well whatever that's the same thing with putting rounds down range

2224
03:27:28.24 --> 03:27:31.84
and same thing with putting hands on someone you know it's like oh you're getting that

2225
03:27:31.84 --> 03:27:35.96
means you're gonna you're about to get in a fight with someone yeah blood's gonna be drawn

2226
03:27:35.96 --> 03:27:40.76
people are getting stabbed whatever put hands on yeah I don't put hands on this dude so he

2227
03:27:40.76 --> 03:27:45.000
had a good one too that I've heard a billion times but he in the phrase he used the phrase

2228
03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:55.12
out of airspeed out of ideas yeah classic aviator you know lingo of yeah screws yeah we're done

2229
03:27:55.12 --> 03:28:00.04
right on so you know speaking of food well I did notice he mentioned he had a cutlass

2230
03:28:00.04 --> 03:28:06.04
supreme with wire wheels on I had one of those too by the way 1985 cutlass supreme did you

2231
03:28:06.04 --> 03:28:10.04
use the same logic as to purchasing that car that he did because the reason he bought that

2232
03:28:10.04 --> 03:28:14.16
was like the coolest story ever yeah the bucket seats versus I don't want the bench I don't

2233
03:28:14.16 --> 03:28:18.60
need a bucket seats I need a bench seat and get that girl right next to me what year was

2234
03:28:18.60 --> 03:28:23.40
your cutlass supreme 85 so that's the same as the impala not the same as the gto little

2235
03:28:23.40 --> 03:28:30.72
different I mean it's the same concept though the impala is like legit and the cutlass supreme

2236
03:28:30.72 --> 03:28:37.08
is like a legit version but it doesn't have quite the power yeah and I didn't at especially

2237
03:28:37.08 --> 03:28:41.000
at the time I didn't not only did I not have the option I bought it for my friend but I

2238
03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:45.000
didn't know that much about it you know I just like the look then I bought the wire wheels

2239
03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:49.36
you know good deal Dave Burke had a Corvette right yes sir it is straight up just like

03:30:52.40 --> 03:30:57.92
we had these at camp at jujitsu camp we got enough for like six days or whatever they were

2262

it an energy drink yes we kind of have to the new year is it comparable to a normal energy

2268
03:31:38.52 --> 03:31:43.88
drink no because a normal energy drink is giving you type 2 diabetes and some other crap issues

03:40:19.04 --> 03:40:29.08
remember the stockdale paradox that is that you can never confuse faith that you're gonna

2360
03:40:29.08 --> 03:40:34.92
prevail in the end so you gotta believe that you're gonna prevail in the end and you can't

2361
03:40:34.92 --> 03:40:39.68
afford to lose that but at the same time you gotta have the discipline to confront the

2362
03:40:39.68 --> 03:40:48.16
most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be so that you can overcome them

2363
03:40:48.16 --> 03:40:55.64
so face the facts and know you can win and then go out and get after it and until next

2364
03:40:55.64 --> 03:41:21.32
time this is Dave and echo and jocco out.
