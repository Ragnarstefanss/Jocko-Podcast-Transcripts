but I think you you have an interview when you go in and they they sort of say You know you got all sorts in there you got guys who don't want to be in a military You know, I've got A what you got guys with drugs you got you know, you know, there's all things and when now You know you just don't it said you know I've gotten to fight and they're like you just got caught Mm-hmm. I hadn't really had That full transition so guys when they're getting out they have like two year build up You know to do all these workshops and these and this set up their companies my was almost You know crash bang your you're out the door my wife at this point was eight months pregnant You know some like I got it's any workout there, you know what I'm gonna do and we're out of sound like Liam Neeson People with our skill sets tends to be the private security industry You know some guys really thrive in the jungle and some guys It's almost like Closter phoat and you know you just spend a lot of time in there day in there and you hear the helicopter coming in and pick up the lads and you see guys It's just you guys randomly packing their bags in our cheetah now that what you're doing is it all well, you know I'm gonna fail this instructor said you know that ignored instructor said I was relentless but in pursuit of what and why Now Obviously you know it's uh something that You know we we have to deal with death on a big way and in Especially when with with people that You know I don't know how old your dad was when he died but 67 Had to had a grown son and and and kids and had lived his life and you know I know for me But you know we will have a website this password protected because for me the my approach to security is You know that there's certain ways of security up my as is more intelligent space You know you have the private element you know we then have the intelligence side of it and then and then the cyber You know we don't you know I don't normally walk around with type black t-shirts with tattoos you know what it's kind of like like You know when you go to work like let's say you go to work every day and you kind of let's say I don't know you're a manager I don't know whatever you go to work every day and you kind of get updated when you go in about and you they see that you made the effort and you've got the coveted green beret You know Probably they get less pressure if they've done the course But actually saying that the Navy guys were really good because a few years later Which were touch and I ended up being in instructor on the on this command of course So the Navy guys because they have no military background before this They've not picked up any bad habits and so what the instructors were telling them they were doing an Upstrate away where as you may have a Assage and or a staff sergeant who's you know been in 14 years and he's already picked up He's a little bad habits and it's happened to you know Realigning or reset that home all her cock But for us our course I didn't learn anything if I'm on I learned nothing on our course Every one of our instructors got sacked at the end of the course Our course was very officer heavy yeah well done, you know, he knows like you know and lads some Special forces don't even bother coming on selection it's like a big thing a female passing but to be honest, you know She deserved to pass and I I generally believe that if deserved pass you know you weren't the right and I did it much to the disgust of my friend The SES still like what you do it and because it's especially like wreckage it we had a hundred percent pass rate and it was like You know if this guy goes then you know people are gonna look at those options You know UK special forces 40 percent The UK special forces made up of the rule Marines. yeah 4,280 miles but you know unlike truckers and and support team you got a worry I've got crocodiles hippos civil war in South Sudan but one thing I'm excited about this challenge You know I talk about we talked about the successful private security missions You know everyone's quite quick to tarnish certain communities you know with one brush what they see with with TV And they read them and said yeah, these are good to go and you know I had a great senior officer Who said you know we're quiet professionals quiet professionals, but that doesn't mean we're silent professionals There's stories that need to be told there's lessons that need to be passed on so You know you look you can you never feel good about it because we're we're not We don't want the spotlight you're never gonna feel good about it It's always very you know I remember the conversations around when when I hadn't written a book and just saying like We're not gonna do anything that sheds any light that puts anything We don't have anything bad to say about the military about the seal teams like that's that's not what we're doing We're obviously not giving away any Information that could be useful at all to the enemy and You know, that's obviously of You know when when we ran these books when I ran these books through the chain of command But I hear that they'll be like hey like there's little writers there That'll be like hey look we're gonna send these people on a trip To the Bahamas and hey you like you got to you got to say that you don't want to go because of what this lady said Like last month on Instagram or something like this and you better tell her and we'll just see how it plays out kind of a thing So if you see something you like just let me know that you enjoyed my assistant directing I feel like we all kind of enjoyed your 10 List of 10 things that you utilize on the daily business What I think I think that was kind of a cool little hit that you guys kind of you know I mentioned that my daughter kind of drove the The spirit behind that and people think I think people think that that meant that she made it She kind of did You know they they had a means of income for me at the time It didn't work because I was smuggling people across borders You know I was a really you know close relationship with Harry you know so at the time it then didn't look right that you were on TV Say it wasn't you can't do it. You need to go there fully focused You know, so guys guys will get letters from their wives You know blue ease and she's having a bad day, you know if she's at home with a fridge or cold or blue We blew it you just be like blue blue blue envelopes which are free free post garot I was that awful as said I said that's fine But know that no other army light, especially airborne is gonna come in to esps if you call as marines You have to call as troopers so when I went there I was almost like the guinea pig You know what works what doesn't work and things like that You know If it wasn't for those local communities being so hospitable I would never been in success Well on them and that's where they African now is going to be great because it's I'm going to have to rely on the locals to help me and so You know it's not a real record whatever I do is the world record But one of the so that's the next challenge But one of the big feedbacks on the book is yes great endurance, but you are the security guru Why you still not in this industry so for me I've I've got a niche security company you know very low key We help either corporates. and You know, RF Leaming You know, you're tornados and you're your fighters you know with their brown shoes probably and the And let's see that Ariv Lee the J attack course is a wooden hut at the end of the runway You know, no one even knows were there And as we'll patrolling you know to the FRV I was a real man and I kept hearing Something I'm sorry to that Stop the team get down on one knee you know all round the fence and we're all looking for our size There's nothing there but you can hear Almost like the creep in in the leaves you know someone sneaking up on us Anyway, this carried on all the way through we got to the position even when we're in the OP position We could hear it but you need diversity You need diversity in there and that's what the army the army brought in Also the fact that at the time the SES We're running Iraq and the esps were running afghan so again, you know if you guys want to go on selection You know Iraq will start to wind down You know guys were looking towards afghan I thought I'll deal with that on the time It was there was the planet you know one of the things we'd got in the military is that meticulous planning and the detail You know even in the Canadian embassy I thought if you have the right plan Then you just bring that in it you know, so I just took a military set of orders and put it on it yeah, you know Sort of you know I when I got out as well I didn't want to be going out to Afghanistan and Iraq you know I've done my time in the dead I said look I'm gonna cycle the world longest road and you know doing a world record what what should we do it and The This was 2016 so his brother and Kay and him were about a launch campaign in 2017 called heads together Which was a mental health campaign and in the military I'd seen it firsthand, you know some my friends, you know For me yeah for weeks in the snow You know it separates the boys from the men What is the up tempo like when you'd get back out how often would how much downtime which is getting then you'd roll back out Now we'd be rolling you know we'd we'd obviously deserve some research It was it is everything from urban to rural you know we were doing stuff as well in in in vehicles We had snipers in in in the tall buildings in the middle of Pristina You know when you know we talk about identity crisis you spent All this time in the military working in a tiny net unit, you know Knowing what you're doing day out working alongside professionals to like Where do I now fit in society? I mean it's like the a different approach essentially then like a you know like when you think of prison Outside of the military you're like now that's your punishment straight up like you That's beyond a spinner for two hours each night for six weeks How was When you when you got dropped from selection the first time around like you kind of make it like it's no big deal I only know from my experience It's a when you if people don't make it through like a basic seal training It's it's it's horrible because you're gonna be in the regular navy and that's not what you're doing the navy to do and all of a sudden you're doing this other thing That's the only difference You know you are going to you're doing drill you know the guards we're like today We're gonna take off on the runway and there's just be much in this fast as you can I mean you have the gym instructors and then you do Aircraft recognition you'd be on the ranges you go from runs PT you would run out of the camp gates and I remember running like I think It's like you know because occasionally guys are getting the down check because whatever Yeah, I said you know did they may have got through the jungle phase, but it may be look Not this time but with the jungle you only get one attempt Is that that that's your only attempt So they they had their own life so when I joined the army that was it that was my family you know I would only get in touch my dad was at old school you know me and he I remember getting a phone call is that you got to ring your dad about really you know so it's a strategic move Obviously to do that and take care of those people and and give them a good deal and and clean your reputation up after it Been a little bit you know tarnished by this involvement and and you know you go into some details on the book on that about just just the fact that You know you can be sitting there talking to the actual prime minister of the country at the time But in all the planning in the place Doing all our wreckies using his private jet in butterfly over the areas identifying you know There's any aircraft we can utilize you know without the top of the the equipment list We had kit coming in from like platter tank you know all over the world Yeah, you know when guys were getting in trouble more because there's also less going on and Really a lot of a bull is down to leadership too, you know if you're if your Leadership isn't given you stuff to do and pointing you in the right direction Where do you end up if you're 18 years old if you're 21 years old if you're 19 years old and you don't you're not given good direction Where do you end up as a as a young male where do you end up echo Charles? and he said you know these guys Well, you know these guys will or make your man you know You know so the next three months you know unless you're a real you know do a Neil diamond Negrine negligent discharge or something like that you should you should be safe And what's the last three months? There's gonna be a problem So those gold versus red stripes was it kind of like It's kind of cool to have the red one or is it kind of put out the gold or what is it depends on your assessment of the situation That's what I mean like what was the common like the culture like if you see in a guy and one guy had a gold one guy A huge deal not a huge deal, but like BTF Tony so we had the most HVTs and any squudgeon and we had more HVTs In first three months and the last three squudgeons back to back Because we were just changing the way that that we operated as you know out there You had to change you know they all knew your TTPs and you had to change and adapt to that so for me I was at the pinnacle, you know I'd missed out that time of free command to regail, but I I made up for it in abundance and It was it it was always interesting to see that there would be guys that would be master chiefs and they'd have that they'd have red stripes I mean they got in trouble at some point in their career and the reason I asked that is because you know it's up as more and more focus sort of More more attention to the seal teams You know, it was like a lot less of a there's there's more of a zero defect mentality and then they're coming down as like right Get's no preferential treatment, you know, treat him like one in their own you know Baba, but that's fine Harry then comes back in and the first lecture is cool signs So on the course you call jackpot one to jackpot one eight so at least the pilot knows Who the student is well I grew up surfing too in in cold the cold water of New England and I was looking at you know when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to go into and one of the things that was Seems like a really good deal was either being stationed in Virginia Beach which is good waves on the east coast and or San Diego Which is San Diego and Either that you know, are you going to for betting or for Lewis or you just there's some other places to get station so that definitely helped Guide me in the right direction. You can do a press up you can do a half press up you can hold it for a few seconds Then fully down you know, so we we did that I mean there's ways it weighs around it But for them as as students you know I was seeing a better product at the end and probably what they did of me Four years before so I did like I did like that change The we had a couple of instructors on the course and you know I soon learned how you can get the most out of of your students I know when I was on my course You know I didn't learn anything I picked up when I got to the unit But that backfired on instructors because at the end of the course they do like course critiques You know how was your course and could it was so officer heavy that they went to town on Oh, they went to town on because then this and guys get handed a critique and they're like So you know these guys would give me in reports of where the ivory was going from Africa You know to the far east you know I He takes me so let's catch up in a car park so a caught up in a car park and this was This was now ready is training to be a pilot and you know we we started chatting and he said look Pass my course I need to make a decision you know where I fly Apache or links and links is like Glorify taxi driver for genals round and it's actually only 100 kilometers coastal road from triply to tuners So I flew in and we'd already evacuated a couple of people from USA and I did I don't go With the big overt vehicle was like local taxis and just keep it all low profile and The week before the British got engaged at every checkpoint on the way to to tuners which is obviously Warri in the Canadians so me my fixer We went out and we just rather speak into the guys who got the weapons we know identified who the tribal elders was sat down with them No shared bread, yeah They're gonna take Special forces soldiers and gonna put civilians through some kind of a Form of some kind of selection and as he's doing this you know you're he's interested in having you be one of the guys And the question was has this been cleared through the MOD through the Ministry of Defense and You start running this up the chain of command and you're you know asking if this can happen or So we had these MP7s these weapons and these guys came in two days later from this hook You know these hurt from Afghan and Iraq and where's our weapons and I'd sort of sort of changing their mindset There actually there is no friend and you know needs to be all all low key I was also trying to find A niche within the industry and I was looking at all these other security companies a lot of my friends had there their security companies were doing Anti piracy of these coast of Africa so I don't want to tread on their feet But you know when my back story sat in his architects and planners meetings or that No interest in these drawings and you know me My wife could see the glaze over my eyes you know I was a morning yesterday in the coffee in the biscuits actually When my son was born I was a one-hole in the baby feeling feeding the baby you know Jo that my wife didn't marry me could have looked like lands on some or Chris Fremor try not going like Chris often as a can but you know for me any It's like probably coming to San Diego, you know, you've got two weeks in the gas lamp You know if it is guys, they're saving up their money. You know, if you start coming in, you know, just over five or about half four, you know, the instructors were already at March or cards. You know you've got some fudge and you're not scraping in but Groundhog day for four weeks doing that on the brekk and beacons in wells is uh and you don't know There's no like cut off time. It felt I will compromise but there was a lot of movement You know, especially at night and then some some you know Call of green slime intelligent core this guy that I did forget to mention it is breathing season for the tour choices So actually what we were sitting here in was the torses that coming out to make But it kept the whole patrol on stand two for two weeks So you guys are doing recon patrols how big of a team's you guys were on out with two in six Man team I we were about to go on a An ex-cycle saves a rear in Oman was a big big ex-size and remember obviously seeing the twin stars You know getting pulled into the cinema watching it and then that That afternoon I got a phone call from the the dive school saying that you know there's an army advanced diving course Start yesterday. you know when I got out a lot of my friends went over to work in the UAE Train their military which is great good money and things out, but I wanted to learn more You know Outside that militia environment as well. So the the airborne engineers Of course, but when I when I got there our troops staff sergeant you know Said there's no need to do pee company, you know We'll run our own selection process which Disgrantled somebody older boys they felt no you have to do pee company Yeah, so the will record was 117 days and when I was doing my plan in I thought you know This certain contingencies those things that are out your control bit natural disasters Coos and things that so far by encounter any of them on the challenge you know I don't want to eat into the challenge So my target was 110 days The bike ride was actually easier than managing egos egos You know because they're pro bono they all started wanting one in more from the challenge as they saw it evolving and thankfully my wife was a campaign direct She was sort of managing keeping control of that we got to I've talked about you know Going from South to North that was a great decision from a side-con perspective. Yeah, good a great attitude that I think a lot of people Could use you know from a leader's not just instructor but from just a leadership perspective You know that you think maybe you need to yell to get someone's respect He's probably is most comfortable there because he wasn't being critiqued by the media and Everyone else he could be Harry could be you know left ten and where wasn't things like that and he was actually a good Operate you know he's clear and precise over the net. Do you feel like you were able like I was very lucky because I was gotten new instructor roles and they were able to teach I taught everything it was awesome I felt like I learned a lot while I was teaching because now you're observing I mean from a leadership perspective You know us when I was at E5 They are screaming and shouting out you but as soon as they've gone they're just treat you like adults You know, I mean it's they take away all those sort of There's creature comforts, you know, you don't you're not allowed to phone anyone it's Two PT sessions a day. and they were actually getting promoted when they got back to their units and they had to stop that I said no it's You know you're there for a long you know the bad bad reasons you can't be seen to be be promoted So guys I would see guys leaving and never come back So for me this when I then started my head started turning towards your patunius special forces You know my dad told me last two minutes I managed to get through base at training I've done a peach out a manager get through coldchester a manager get through the commander course I'm now just about getting my my paroings and you're also then amongst like minded individuals those who want to go or aspire to be special forces So I just flown in I hadn't seen them for months I said right I'm just off to my friends out and that what I said because you know you guys tomorrow It will be useless you know Yeah, I think obviously you can have the impact anyway, you know for me when I did the first selection You know I've got quite big hill legs And I then get a phone call from the Canadian embassy so what had happened now is the triply war It's a civil war between the militias and the government and Embassies the only reason embassies are in countries all about trade and investment You know what can we get for for our country know when it when things start opening up So October 13 the They'd done an assessment the Canadians and basically It was costing them 20 million dollars a year to have the embassy open and the Sort of assessment was there's a good mean no trade investment for about at least 15 years but like I said that eight hours I had with my dad You know that was the longest I had and you know for me
