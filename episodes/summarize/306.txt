He may well strive to reduce dissidents by telling himself and others that the correlation between smoking and cancer could Just as well be taken to signify that people who are going to get cancer anyway tend to smoke in order to ward off the disease So you're just telling yourself lies to try to try and even out that disagreement in your own head Since it was first Propounded by a festinger in 1957 dissonance theory has given rise to a large number of empirical studies Through the though the precise nature of the underlying psychological processes as far from clear There are certain conclusions which could have serious implications for military decision making They may be summarized by saying that quote once the decision has been made and the person is committed to a given course of action The psychological situation changes decisively There is less emphasis on objectivity and there is more partiality and bias in the way in which the person views and evaluates the alternatives and quote in other words decision making may well be followed by a period of mental activity that could be described as at the very least Some what one cited Yeah, dude you I would he like I got halfway into that sentence and you were just shaking your head because you know you seen this happen totally and he you know He you did that list earlier and I the one that was Coming back to as you're talking about in the hard part about as you can you can I know what you're gonna say before He's saying and now you know what's coming when he's describing this is here's the plan Jocco's down in the front sends me a report. This is where we start to get a little psychological reference there that we have things in our subconscious that make us a certain way and one of the things he's saying is people that people that like things to be super orderly, super or orderly they don't like change, they don't like when bad things happen, they don't like when things that you can't control, they don't like those things. Maybe some people are not, you know, 0.01 but you got a spectrum and the case here is that if you look at the military and you see people that are all uniform and you see that everything's clean you look at that as a type of environment I might want to go into because I'm kind of like that and that's how you end up with people in this zone for what you guys wrote it down as like this guy is such a good idea. He says You know If Ellie how do we want proves one thing like you're you're you're pretty tough You know because he sees these guys after six days of freaking you know being awake and doing physical stuff You guys you have proofs one thing you're pretty tough and I actually said back to him I said you know there's a group of people that also Go go through hell week and make it through how weak and what it proves is that they figured out how to how to get through Because there's things you can do in hell week This was an assessment started as skipped it, but this was an assessment that got done of how they were training the Military the army officers and then it says much the same picture has been painted of Britannia four under of the Royal Naval College of Dartmouth Dartmouth again the emphasis was on blind obedience Sport and ceremonial with scant regard to intellectual pursuits and little pride in knowing one's job You know it's funny as soon as you say something like there's too much drill as soon as you say You know if you're maybe you're thinking hey man We're spending a lot of time just doing this like stupid drill stuff There's someone that's like You know, it's like I think I know who those guys are Yeah, and really Anything anything there's no there I'm trying to think of a job Where the full Where where the the primary thing is only intelligence only intelligence I'm sure there's some laboratory somewhere or some computer programming thing where Basically the smartest person is the person that we want that job But as soon as that person is in charge of people anyone else or in soon as there's some level of creativity or problem solving because there's You just you what you want is a person that's composite has a bunch of different skills. This is the important part Because with any situation that you have there's gonna be different sides to every argument There's gonna be different sides to be if we're gonna go to a taqatarget Part of your brain should be saying like okay, this looks like something we can get done part of it to say Okay, there's looks like there's a rata risks as well you got two different things in your head two different In congruent thoughts in your head they they're not the same and you know the different services and aviation have different sets of requirements and you know I think The Marine Corps has the the lowest I guess standard of academic excellence in terms like what you studied in how well you did I mean the old joke in the Marine Corps was you know if you got a 2.0 and underwater basket We even you could be a pilot you know as the joke and you know what they were saying really was But there's something a little different about the ones that make it up to that level and How it isn't quite just the same bell curve of everybody else where you got some smart people some you know middle-the-road folks Maybe some other folks and what I've been trying to Think in my mind about what that is is is kind of what you described is what's unique about those people those people Have figured out how to navigate the system this thing that we're all living in because when you join the military I don't count smart you are dumb But you wouldn't want to put them into a situation where they've got to stand up and talk from people if they don't have that skill So just because someone is smart that's only like one quarter of the of the of the of the math we got to do here totally and when you're thinking about it from a leadership standpoint and The recognition that that leadership requires a whole bunch of different things not just being You know smart and taking a test or being good at communicating it's the recognition that it requires so many different things None of these these profiles that he just revealed are a big shock to me Well, I got one shot up right wouldn't shot up Wait, what is pontificate talking talking carrying on talking especially things that you don't really know too much about It's also not a compliment like if somebody like what's like we're gonna the jacco But you know people might get the impression that oh, you know Jocco it's like at the master when I'm guess what I'm on stage I'm talking that's what we're doing Come to an echelon front meeting You know see who he's talking like see how much I'm talking It well a catch phrase or to be like we've we always done it this way or We need to stick with the plan right those are just catch phrases and that's what I'm gonna say or I just say We know Dave's always got his own freaking Dave's always on his own freaking program like I can I can ridicule you or I can just get mad That's what we sit So he's already building off of taller platform But also Cass Baroff said I think Cass Baroff was like 55 60 something like this Maybe let me know a little bit over he's like yeah, well, I'm older I mean you would think for being a pilot Uh There's gotta be you know that that like the spatial like when I took the officer candid Test and you've got to do the spatial recognition where how far away is this or is this aircraft or is this bird coming to you or going away from you? No that you know blowing things up sounds cool Being an intellectual doesn and if I can figure out early on What is it gonna appeal to you whoever my bosses are that school is or the intent is or the system and that's a Request of this is about the bellkers different of the top because they figured out how to navigate the system What the system wants and what the system wants is whoever's in charge that thing that appeals to them Which is things like What would you rather have someone who? and I say something like you know You know Here comes the new guy with a bread idea You know like to just kind of push you off Maybe that's our problem Another contribution to the incompetence tied up with age was the unhelpful tendency to Sack Fortunately retire or otherwise curtail the promotion of those young officers who unwisely failed to conceal their their lights But-neath bushels of conformity So real quick on the getting old part this is something that I was I think I talked about it on on the academy I heard that interview with Cass Baroff the chess player and Interview or acts actually I think it was Lex Friedman Lex asked him maybe it was Lex I think Lex asked him Not in a direct way, but basically could you beat Magnus Carlson who's right now like this phenom and And Cass Baroff said no and of the part of the answer which is what I talked about on the academy was part of their reason is because Magnus has got to see everything that Cost bar off done and study him. It's simple The subtitle that is simple clear concise communication So pontification is the opposite of that oddly enough Unfortunately such a predisposition it will be the strong the will be strongest in those like head masters judges Prison governors and senior military commanders who for too long have been in a position to lord over their fellow men Unfortunately such a predisposition will also be strongest in authoritarian organizations Where the preservation of apparent omnitions by those above Maybe deemed more important than the truth So this is that senior leader that Basically no one will tell them to be quiet and you know what's even worse than that People sit there with a big smile in their face nodding their heads cuz you know Yeah, I think it's the same I really do I don't think I don't think the personality profile You know or even just the motivational profile of A lot of people in the military is all that different certainly when I think about seals and pilots and as often as you and I kind of contrast those two types of people There's a ton of similarity there And that's what this number is number six an obstinate persistence in a given task Despite strong contrary evidence that was number six number seven of failure to exploit a Situation gained an attendancy to quote poll punches Rather than push home an attack Number eight of failure to make adequate reconnaissance Number nine a predilection for frontal assaults often against the enemies strongest point And again Even what's again at the master I'm Trying to explain to people because you know there's people that want that they would they just want to hear you say look So someone's called some problems. But you know, it's just a bad situation so these are the best things that could happen As response to that is no one would deny there's more to grain of truth and all these propositions cool Facts do get distorted and then the telling disasters are indeed more newsworthy than successes Riders undoubtedly do enjoy painting the worst possible picture of their particular Bet noires many Generals have had to contend with an up-to-toed Unformed interference and the stingingists of their political masters and of course things could have been worse There are counter arguments however because they are Surrogate father figures people are only too ready and anxious to love their adnelson generals particular a time of war We see that a lot right the if someone was in the military Then they must be awesome and And recent years that's gotten I would say even more prolific if someone's that then anything they say has some merit and value Okay, I always thought it was like kind of thinking and talking but in a good way I thought it was like hey, let's get to the bottom of let's listen explore it, you know, but No matter what's going on in your company, you think you got issues, you think you got problems, things are going wrong, things are going sideways. Yes, and although You can smell intent the system has a much harder time smelling intent A system has a much harder time smelling intent look they look at Dave Burke and they look at Jaco and they both went overseas Took a hard fill billet Jaco was doing it because he wanted to get promoted Dave was doing it because he had You know his kids had just left for for a college and so he felt like it was a good time What was the thing with like the bottom the atomic bomb like the technology was like Made for something or the or the idea was like the technology was made for something Gotta tell from looking at it Hey, obviously Someone could be really really smart and suck at that test right not to mention eyesight not to mention Reaction time like all those different things and then same thing with leadership You can have someone that's super articulate that's there's there's really articulate people that aren't really that smart It's, you know, the term self doubt doesn't have like this positive connotation, but it's like, oh, hey, I bet you're this bunch of things I don't know. Yeah, who's gonna weapon like someone's gonna weaponize it in it's like that's the fear like you put you and me in a room I'm gonna consider that I might be wrong and I'm gonna Moose slowly in this direction until we come to a the logical conclusion or I'm just gonna attack this target and run it over And the ones that figure out the system and have a navigate that it makes sense That at the top They actually use a different bell curve of people than those of us at the beginning who actually some of us Don't figure out how to navigate that system.
