00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.76
This is Jocco podcast number 14 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:10.76 --> 00:00:12.36
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:12.36 --> 00:00:14.96
Good evening.

4
00:00:14.96 --> 00:00:29.68
Now I want you to imagine yourself in the moment, the moment just prior to the battle.

5
00:00:29.68 --> 00:00:36.68
Now I don't want you to think because you're a soldier that this training is made you into

6
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:42.44
some kind of a superhuman or maybe into a different kind of being because it hasn't.

7
00:00:42.44 --> 00:00:49.44
The training that you've been through hasn't changed the fact that you're a human being.

8
00:00:49.44 --> 00:00:51.60
All warriors are human beings.

9
00:00:51.60 --> 00:00:55.44
So this is you I'm talking to.

10
00:00:55.44 --> 00:01:01.12
And I want you to think about that time before you are going into the battle because

11
00:01:01.12 --> 00:01:10.04
that's the time when you can actually think when you're waiting.

12
00:01:10.04 --> 00:01:14.20
When you're waiting to go.

13
00:01:14.20 --> 00:01:20.24
And if you're going to feel fear, this is where you feel it because you have time.

14
00:01:20.24 --> 00:01:25.64
The preparation is done, the planning is done, the briefing is done, the gear is prepared

15
00:01:25.64 --> 00:01:31.32
and you are dressed and you are ready to go.

16
00:01:31.32 --> 00:01:35.52
And now you're just waiting.

17
00:01:35.52 --> 00:01:46.000
Waiting for the call or for the signal or for the command to execute.

18
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.52
So you have time to think and in fact all you can do at that moment is think.

19
00:01:56.52 --> 00:02:02.20
And if you're an Iraq, maybe you're waiting to go into the Malab district or Romadi, where

20
00:02:02.20 --> 00:02:12.36
there's been vicious IEDs and casualties happening every day from months on end.

21
00:02:12.36 --> 00:02:16.52
If you're in Vietnam, maybe you're an helicopter and you're about to take part in an

22
00:02:16.52 --> 00:02:22.52
air assault on a known enemy stronghold.

23
00:02:22.52 --> 00:02:28.80
If you're in the Korean War, maybe you're hearing the whistles.

24
00:02:28.80 --> 00:02:37.52
The whistles signaling a coordinated attack by the red army and you're just waiting.

25
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:39.68
Waiting for the shooting to start.

26
00:02:39.68 --> 00:02:44.32
If it's World War II, maybe you're just offshore and you're an landing craft and the

27
00:02:44.32 --> 00:02:51.04
sound of explosions and gunfire and the distance on the beach where you're headed.

28
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:56.96
The beach you're waiting to hit.

29
00:02:56.96 --> 00:03:03.76
If it's World War I, perhaps you're waiting in your 10th burger, for doom or the

30
00:03:03.76 --> 00:03:12.20
song, but you're waiting to go over the top out of that trench and in the almost certain

31
00:03:12.20 --> 00:03:19.68
death.

32
00:03:19.68 --> 00:03:27.04
And in that moment, what do you think about?

33
00:03:27.04 --> 00:03:32.08
You think about family, friends, you think about your life, you think about death.

34
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:42.72
You think about that girl, you wish that you would have asked to marry.

35
00:03:42.72 --> 00:03:45.12
Maybe you're thinking, how did I get myself into this?

36
00:03:45.12 --> 00:03:49.96
Or maybe you're thinking, how do I get myself out of this?

37
00:03:49.96 --> 00:03:53.60
Or maybe you're just sitting there rethinking the plan and the sequence and the orders

38
00:03:53.60 --> 00:03:58.20
you were given.

39
00:03:58.20 --> 00:04:04.48
Maybe you're thinking about your friends, getting killed or wounded.

40
00:04:04.48 --> 00:04:09.28
Maybe you're thinking about yourself getting killed or wounded.

41
00:04:09.28 --> 00:04:17.04
You could be thinking about so many different things.

42
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:21.000
But one thing is certain.

43
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:32.60
Whatever you are thinking about, whatever those thoughts are, those thoughts are clear.

44
00:04:32.60 --> 00:04:47.40
Those thoughts are an insight into your true nature, into your being, into your soul.

45
00:04:47.40 --> 00:04:50.96
And maybe that's the thing.

46
00:04:50.96 --> 00:04:54.000
Maybe that's the thing we miss about combat.

47
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.80
And we always hear about the adrenaline rush and the excitement and the challenge of combat.

48
00:05:03.80 --> 00:05:16.36
But what about the cleansing of the mind against a backdrop of death?

49
00:05:16.36 --> 00:05:25.44
It seems like there's some purity that can only be revealed by the horror and the blood

50
00:05:25.44 --> 00:05:34.36
and the violence of impending combat.

51
00:05:34.36 --> 00:05:46.04
And as you think these thoughts in this moment when you realize that who's killing us is us.

52
00:05:46.04 --> 00:05:52.52
And as you think of the people, it's other humans and what are they thinking?

53
00:05:52.52 --> 00:05:54.48
Who are they?

54
00:05:54.48 --> 00:05:55.84
Why are they?

55
00:05:55.84 --> 00:05:59.56
What are they?

56
00:05:59.56 --> 00:06:09.52
And one of my do-near, why am I here?

57
00:06:09.52 --> 00:06:15.000
And despite all those thoughts and all those ideas and all those questions, there's only

58
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.44
one answer.

59
00:06:20.44 --> 00:06:25.56
And the politics they disappear and the thoughts disappear and the fears and the reservations

60
00:06:25.56 --> 00:06:35.16
and the concern and the ego, it all disappears.

61
00:06:35.16 --> 00:06:42.76
Because at that moment, the moment of truth, there's only one answer.

62
00:06:42.76 --> 00:06:55.48
Forward, forward into the battle, into the fray.

63
00:06:55.48 --> 00:07:09.20
Toward the smoke and the fire and the bullets and the bombs and towards death to face it all

64
00:07:09.20 --> 00:07:12.44
head on.

65
00:07:12.44 --> 00:07:22.88
And maybe that is what the real addiction of combat is.

66
00:07:22.88 --> 00:07:28.36
Maybe that's what we yearn for.

67
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:39.64
Maybe those thoughts that fill our dreams and our nightmares to be there again in the

68
00:07:39.64 --> 00:07:52.32
breach to have but one clear and resounding purpose for everything in our lives, everything

69
00:07:52.32 --> 00:08:00.88
in our world, everything in past, in present, in future, all of it wrapped up into that

70
00:08:00.88 --> 00:08:09.32
one instant to have that one singular purpose for being alive.

71
00:08:09.32 --> 00:08:23.16
And that moment to attack, attack with everything you have with every ounce of commitment,

72
00:08:23.16 --> 00:08:30.68
with every bit of clarity and focus that you as a human being can possibly muster.

73
00:08:30.68 --> 00:08:47.88
Attack with your weapons and your mind and your body and attack with your very soul.

74
00:08:47.88 --> 00:09:13.48
And maybe that purity is what we miss, is what I miss about combat.

75
00:09:13.48 --> 00:09:18.56
And so let's go back there once again.

76
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:28.76
Once again to the battlefield to World War I again in my mind the most brutal of all wars.

77
00:09:28.76 --> 00:09:36.92
We're tactics and intelligence and strategy did not matter.

78
00:09:36.92 --> 00:09:42.44
It was a trishin and death and horror.

79
00:09:42.44 --> 00:09:53.64
Thundered possible only because of the purest and almost insane level of selflessness and

80
00:09:53.64 --> 00:10:07.92
bravery.

81
00:10:07.92 --> 00:10:17.16
And this starts off in that very situation, waiting for combat.

82
00:10:17.16 --> 00:10:25.04
I sat up for a long time that night in the foreboding eve of battle mood of which all

83
00:10:25.04 --> 00:10:29.64
soldiers at all times have left report.

84
00:10:29.64 --> 00:10:37.04
On a tree stump cluster around with blue edamons, before I crept over the ranks of my comrades

85
00:10:37.04 --> 00:10:48.28
to the tent, I had tangled dreams in which a principal role was played by a skull.

86
00:10:48.28 --> 00:10:54.80
In the morning the tender green of young leaves shimpered in the flat light.

87
00:10:54.80 --> 00:11:00.96
We followed hidden twisting paths toward a narrow gorge behind the front line.

88
00:11:00.96 --> 00:11:05.48
On the dawn of noon our artillery launched into a furious bombardment that echoed and

89
00:11:05.48 --> 00:11:08.92
re-acquered through the hollows of the wooded hollows.

90
00:11:08.92 --> 00:11:15.48
For the first time we heard what was meant by the expression drum fire.

91
00:11:15.48 --> 00:11:20.04
We sat perched on our haves, haversax, idle and excited.

92
00:11:20.04 --> 00:11:24.48
A runner plunged through the company to the company commander.

93
00:11:24.48 --> 00:11:26.32
Brisk exchange.

94
00:11:26.32 --> 00:11:31.44
The three-nears trenches have fallen to us and six field guns have been captured.

95
00:11:31.44 --> 00:11:37.16
Without cheers rang out, a feeling of up and Adam.

96
00:11:37.16 --> 00:11:42.32
At loss at last the long four-order.

97
00:11:42.32 --> 00:11:47.36
In a long line we moved forward toward the pattering of heavy rifle fire.

98
00:11:47.36 --> 00:11:49.48
It was getting serious.

99
00:11:49.48 --> 00:11:54.88
To the side of the forest path, dull thumps came down in a clump of furs, bring down a

100
00:11:54.88 --> 00:11:57.48
rain of branches and soil.

101
00:11:57.48 --> 00:12:01.40
One nervous soldier threw himself to the ground.

102
00:12:01.40 --> 00:12:05.72
Then death's call slipped through the ranks.

103
00:12:05.72 --> 00:12:08.44
Ambulance meant to the front.

104
00:12:08.44 --> 00:12:12.08
A little later we passed the spot that had been hit.

105
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:16.80
The casualties had already been removed, bloody scraps of cloth and flesh had been left

106
00:12:16.80 --> 00:12:19.000
on the bushes around the crater.

107
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.84
A strange and dreadful sight that put me in mind of the butcher bird that spikes its prey

108
00:12:24.84 --> 00:12:29.96
on thorn bushes.

109
00:12:29.96 --> 00:12:34.84
He entered the battle trampled realm of the infantrymen.

110
00:12:34.84 --> 00:12:39.80
The area around the jumping off position had been deforested by the shells.

111
00:12:39.80 --> 00:12:44.28
In the ripped up nomans land lay the victims of the attack still facing the enemy.

112
00:12:44.28 --> 00:12:47.84
Their great tunics barely stood out from the ground.

113
00:12:47.84 --> 00:12:52.80
A giant form with red, blood-spattered beard stared fixed at the sky.

114
00:12:52.80 --> 00:12:56.000
His fingers clutching the spongy ground.

115
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.40
A young man tossed in a shell crater, his features already yellow with impending death.

116
00:13:02.40 --> 00:13:04.96
He seemed not to want to be looked at.

117
00:13:04.96 --> 00:13:11.32
He gave us a cross shrug and pulled this coat over his head and lay still.

118
00:13:11.32 --> 00:13:16.76
In a curious failure of comprehension, I looked alertly about me for possible targets for

119
00:13:16.76 --> 00:13:21.76
all this artillery fire not apparently realizing that it was actually ourselves that the

120
00:13:21.76 --> 00:13:27.36
enemy enemy gunners were trying for all they were worth to hit.

121
00:13:27.36 --> 00:13:32.92
Ambulance men, we had our first fatality, a sharp no ball had a rip-through riflemen stoned

122
00:13:32.92 --> 00:13:35.84
stulters caught carotoddery.

123
00:13:35.84 --> 00:13:40.48
Three packets of lint were sawed with blood in no time, in a matter of seconds he bled

124
00:13:40.48 --> 00:13:43.12
to death.

125
00:13:43.12 --> 00:13:49.72
In the rising mist, I leapt out of the trench and found a shrunken French corpse.

126
00:13:49.72 --> 00:13:56.48
Much like moldering fish, gleam greenly, greenishly through slits in the shredded uniform.

127
00:13:56.48 --> 00:14:00.60
Turning around, I took a step back in horror, next to me was a figure crouched against

128
00:14:00.60 --> 00:14:02.24
a tree.

129
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:08.64
It still had gleaming French leather harness and on its back was a fully packed haversac,

130
00:14:08.64 --> 00:14:11.92
topped by a round mist in.

131
00:14:11.92 --> 00:14:17.76
empty eye sockets and a few strands of hair on the blueish black skull indicated that the

132
00:14:17.76 --> 00:14:21.36
man was not among the living.

133
00:14:21.36 --> 00:14:27.20
There was another sitting down slumped forward towards his feet, as though he had just collapsed.

134
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:34.12
All around were dozens more, rotted, dried, stiffened to mummies, frozen in an eerie dance

135
00:14:34.12 --> 00:14:36.68
of death.

136
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:41.76
The French must have spent months in the proximity of their fallen comrades without bearing

137
00:14:41.76 --> 00:14:42.76
them.

138
00:14:42.76 --> 00:14:53.04
A headless torso was jammed in some shot-up beams, head and neck were gone white cartilage

139
00:14:53.04 --> 00:14:57.16
gleamed out of a reddish black flesh.

140
00:14:57.16 --> 00:14:59.64
I found it difficult to fathom.

141
00:14:59.64 --> 00:15:05.88
Next to this very young man lay on his back with glass-y eyes and fist still aiming.

142
00:15:05.88 --> 00:15:12.40
A peculiar feeling, looking into dead, questioning eyes, a shutter that I never quite lost

143
00:15:12.40 --> 00:15:19.68
in the course of the war has pockets had been turned inside out and his empty wallet

144
00:15:19.68 --> 00:15:29.000
lay beside him.

145
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.92
So that right there is the portion of the opening chapters of a book called Storm of Steel.

146
00:15:39.92 --> 00:15:43.80
Going into the introduction of the book, it says Storm of Steel is one of the great books

147
00:15:43.80 --> 00:15:48.20
of World War I, if not the greatest.

148
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:54.96
Ernst Junger, that's the author, Ernst Junger's book on the 1914 war, Storm of Steel,

149
00:15:54.96 --> 00:16:01.36
is without question the finest book on war that I know utterly honest, truthful, in good

150
00:16:01.36 --> 00:16:04.16
faith.

151
00:16:04.16 --> 00:16:12.000
In contrast with most of the others is stark, it has no pacifist design, it makes no personal

152
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.08
appeal.

153
00:16:14.08 --> 00:16:21.04
It is notably unconstructed book, it does not set its author and his experience in any sort

154
00:16:21.04 --> 00:16:23.04
of context.

155
00:16:23.04 --> 00:16:31.76
It offers nothing in the way of house and wise, it is pure wear and when and of course above

156
00:16:31.76 --> 00:16:35.000
all what?

157
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.96
There is nothing in it about the politics of war, nothing even on its outcome and very

158
00:16:41.96 --> 00:16:47.64
little on the wider strategy of its conduct.

159
00:16:47.64 --> 00:16:58.20
War is all fighting is all, everything else is cropped away and from first to last in the

160
00:16:58.20 --> 00:17:00.72
affirmative.

161
00:17:00.72 --> 00:17:13.84
It is the work of a man whom the war made.

162
00:17:13.84 --> 00:17:16.84
So it's a little bit of a different kind of book.

163
00:17:16.84 --> 00:17:19.52
That was someone explaining the book.

164
00:17:19.52 --> 00:17:25.36
Someone explaining the book and just how it is, it's just about the fighting.

165
00:17:25.36 --> 00:17:33.80
So it's just about the fighting and that's one of the things that makes it so powerful.

166
00:17:33.80 --> 00:17:40.08
It's also one of the things that reflects very well what it feels like to be on the frontlines

167
00:17:40.08 --> 00:17:43.92
when politics don't matter, when the outcome doesn't even matter.

168
00:17:43.92 --> 00:17:46.92
The outcome of the broader war doesn't matter anymore.

169
00:17:46.92 --> 00:17:56.84
So what are we doing right now in this trench?

170
00:17:56.84 --> 00:18:02.000
Talking about being in these trenches which obviously all these soldiers spent and immense

171
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.32
amount of time, they lived in these trenches.

172
00:18:07.32 --> 00:18:12.88
Back to the book, the desolation and the profound silence, sporadically broken by the

173
00:18:12.88 --> 00:18:18.56
crump of shells were heightened by the sorry impression of devastation.

174
00:18:18.56 --> 00:18:24.52
Ripped haversax, broken rifles, scraps of cloth, counterpointed, grotesque with children's

175
00:18:24.52 --> 00:18:31.40
toys, shell fuses, deep craters from explosions, bottles, harvest implements, shredded

176
00:18:31.40 --> 00:18:37.64
books, battered household gear, holes whose gaping darkness betrayed the presence of

177
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:43.12
basements where the bodies of unlucky inhabitants of the houses were nod by the particularly

178
00:18:43.12 --> 00:18:46.52
ascidious swarms of rats.

179
00:18:46.52 --> 00:18:52.08
In the cattle buyers and stables and barns the bones of livestock still dangling from their

180
00:18:52.08 --> 00:18:58.80
chains, trenches dug through ravaged gardens, in among sprouting bulbs of onions, warm

181
00:18:58.80 --> 00:19:04.08
wood, rhubarb, narcissus, buried underweeds.

182
00:19:04.08 --> 00:19:09.24
From the neighboring fields, grain barns, through whose roofs grain, the grain was already

183
00:19:09.24 --> 00:19:16.80
sprouting, all that with half buried communication trench running through it, and all suffused

184
00:19:16.80 --> 00:19:21.44
with the smell of burning and decay.

185
00:19:21.44 --> 00:19:26.76
Sad thoughts are apt to sneak up on the warrior in such a low cow, when he thinks of

186
00:19:26.76 --> 00:19:32.16
those who only recently led their lives in tranquility.

187
00:19:32.16 --> 00:19:37.56
So, he's actually providing a little caution to people, little caution to the warriors

188
00:19:37.56 --> 00:19:44.36
that when you see these babies toys and this normal village that's been ripped and

189
00:19:44.36 --> 00:19:49.84
hours trenches running through it, and you can't let that sneak up on you.

190
00:19:49.84 --> 00:20:02.04
He says, that emotion, you've got to detach yourself from that, and speaking of the rats,

191
00:20:02.04 --> 00:20:07.32
he says, they are repellent creatures, and am always thinking of the secret desecrations

192
00:20:07.32 --> 00:20:10.72
they perform on the bodies and the village basements.

193
00:20:10.72 --> 00:20:16.44
Once, as I was striding through the ruins of Monarchy on a warm night, they came oozing

194
00:20:16.44 --> 00:20:22.60
out of their hiding places in such undescribable numbers that the ground was like a long

195
00:20:22.60 --> 00:20:29.56
carpet of them, patterned with the occasional white of an Albino.

196
00:20:29.56 --> 00:20:32.84
So, so many rats.

197
00:20:32.84 --> 00:20:36.44
First of all, so many rats that it looks like a carpet and so many rats that there's actually

198
00:20:36.44 --> 00:20:40.44
a regular occurrence of Albino rats.

199
00:20:40.44 --> 00:20:48.48
That's a lot of rats.

200
00:20:48.48 --> 00:20:52.76
And talking about life in the trench, we're real renaissance back to the book, we're real

201
00:20:52.76 --> 00:20:58.24
renaissance men, who can turn our hands to anything and the trenches make their thousand

202
00:20:58.24 --> 00:21:01.12
fold the man's on us every day.

203
00:21:01.12 --> 00:21:07.72
We sink deep shafts, construct dugouts, and concrete pill boxes, rig up wire and tanklements,

204
00:21:07.72 --> 00:21:10.48
divine drainage systems.

205
00:21:10.48 --> 00:21:17.60
Reveille support, level, rays, and smooth, fill in the trees, in a word we do all possible

206
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:20.32
tasks ourselves.

207
00:21:20.32 --> 00:21:25.64
So these guys are in the business of constructing their house, constructing the trenches

208
00:21:25.64 --> 00:21:29.44
that they live in, they live in these dugouts which is like a lower part of the trench

209
00:21:29.44 --> 00:21:33.56
where they dig in, they build all the stuff themselves.

210
00:21:33.56 --> 00:21:34.56
And that's what they do.

211
00:21:34.56 --> 00:21:41.24
And then in the middle of that, back to the book, a century collapses, streaming blood, shot

212
00:21:41.24 --> 00:21:43.04
in the head.

213
00:21:43.04 --> 00:21:48.04
His comrades ripped the bandage roll out of his tunic and get them bandaged up.

214
00:21:48.04 --> 00:21:50.04
There's no point, Bill.

215
00:21:50.04 --> 00:21:53.08
Come on, he's still breathing, isn't he?

216
00:21:53.08 --> 00:21:58.16
And the stretchers bearers come along to carry him to the dressing station.

217
00:21:58.16 --> 00:22:02.40
The stretcher pulls collide with the corners of the firebase.

218
00:22:02.40 --> 00:22:08.36
No sooner has the man disappeared than everything is back to the way it was before.

219
00:22:08.36 --> 00:22:13.60
Someone spreads a few shovels of earth over the red puddle, and everyone goes back to

220
00:22:13.60 --> 00:22:16.04
whatever he was doing.

221
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:21.000
Only a new recruit may be leans against the revetment, looking a little green about

222
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.72
the gills, he's endeavoring to put it all together.

223
00:22:25.72 --> 00:22:31.96
Such an incredibly brutal assault, so sudden with no warning given, it can't be possible,

224
00:22:31.96 --> 00:22:37.08
it can't be real for a fellow.

225
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:49.68
If only you knew what was in store for you.

226
00:22:49.68 --> 00:22:53.64
Then October 1915.

227
00:22:53.64 --> 00:22:58.48
Standing at dawn on the fire step opposite our dugout next to the century, when a rifle

228
00:22:58.48 --> 00:23:03.04
bullet ripped through his forge cap without harming a hair on his head.

229
00:23:03.04 --> 00:23:08.40
At the same time, two pioneers were wounded on the wires, one had a ricochet shot through

230
00:23:08.40 --> 00:23:12.48
both legs, the other a ball through his ear.

231
00:23:12.48 --> 00:23:16.64
In the morning, the century out on a flank was shot through both cheekbones.

232
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:23.12
The blood spurred out of him in thick gouts, and to cap it all, when Lieutenant Vaughn

233
00:23:23.12 --> 00:23:29.36
E. Wald visiting our sector to take pictures of SAPN barely 50 yards away turned to climb

234
00:23:29.36 --> 00:23:35.64
down from the outlook, a bullet shattered the back of his skull and he died on the spot.

235
00:23:35.64 --> 00:23:40.24
Large fragments of skull were left littering the century platform.

236
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:44.76
Also a man was hitting the shoulder, but not badly.

237
00:23:44.76 --> 00:23:49.40
The middle of the platoon section of trench was attacked with six and shells.

238
00:23:49.40 --> 00:23:54.92
One man was hurled against a post by the blast so hard, he sustained serious internal injuries,

239
00:23:54.92 --> 00:23:59.08
and a splinter of wood punctured the artery in his arm.

240
00:23:59.08 --> 00:24:04.76
That night two men were wounded while on spooling wire.

241
00:24:04.76 --> 00:24:11.44
Goot Schmidt was shot in both hands in one thigh and shaver took a bullet in the knee.

242
00:24:11.44 --> 00:24:16.16
Having a torrential downpour in the night, all the traverses came down and formed a gray

243
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:21.60
sludgy porridge with the rain, turning the trench into a deep swamp.

244
00:24:21.60 --> 00:24:27.32
Our only consolation was at the British, or just as badly off as we were, because we could

245
00:24:27.32 --> 00:24:30.88
see them bailing out for all they were worth.

246
00:24:30.88 --> 00:24:35.24
Since our position has a little more elevation than theirs, we even managed to pump our

247
00:24:35.24 --> 00:24:37.80
excess their way.

248
00:24:37.80 --> 00:24:42.36
Here it is, they're almost face to face with the British.

249
00:24:42.36 --> 00:24:47.04
They're getting downpour of rain and they take a little satisfaction.

250
00:24:47.04 --> 00:24:51.12
The fact that they can actually funnel some of the water into the British trench, that's

251
00:24:51.12 --> 00:24:54.84
how close they are.

252
00:24:54.84 --> 00:25:00.76
The crumbled trench walls explode, exposed a line of bodies left there from the previous

253
00:25:00.76 --> 00:25:05.28
autumn's fighting.

254
00:25:05.28 --> 00:25:12.96
I was standing next to Territorial Weedman in front of the Altonburg Redout when a long

255
00:25:12.96 --> 00:25:17.12
shot passed through his bayonet, which he was carrying over a shoulder and gave him a bad

256
00:25:17.12 --> 00:25:21.68
wound in the groin.

257
00:25:21.68 --> 00:25:29.96
This is kind of the daily life that he talks about being stuck in these trenches.

258
00:25:29.96 --> 00:25:34.16
And it's just brutal.

259
00:25:34.16 --> 00:25:40.36
It's brutal and you can kind of get the matter of factness that he delivers so much of

260
00:25:40.36 --> 00:25:41.36
this with.

261
00:25:41.36 --> 00:25:45.32
Take this guy with shot, this guy with shot, this guy with how to leg blown off.

262
00:25:45.32 --> 00:25:50.08
It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom.

263
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:54.96
When he mentions how he noticed someone else reacting to that, when meanwhile it's just

264
00:25:54.96 --> 00:26:00.24
real matter of fact to him, but just the other guy reacting to it stands out.

265
00:26:00.24 --> 00:26:05.08
That's all matter of fact it is.

266
00:26:05.08 --> 00:26:11.40
And the book, which I kind of got in the beginning, talked about some of this first combat

267
00:26:11.40 --> 00:26:17.64
that he was exposed when he goes on to go through, I mean just the battle was on, which

268
00:26:17.64 --> 00:26:23.68
is 60,000 casualties in the first day.

269
00:26:23.68 --> 00:26:32.72
There were 58,000 killed in Vietnam, I mean 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam.

270
00:26:32.72 --> 00:26:38.08
We're talking 60,000 casualties the first day and in three months there was a million.

271
00:26:38.08 --> 00:26:41.72
A million.

272
00:26:41.72 --> 00:26:45.96
It's the whole state of Hawaii, by the way.

273
00:26:45.96 --> 00:26:50.32
It's unbelievable what this war was.

274
00:26:50.32 --> 00:26:53.000
It really was.

275
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.36
It's really unfathomless.

276
00:26:54.36 --> 00:26:59.72
I think about what these guys were ordered to do and the fact that they did it over and

277
00:26:59.72 --> 00:27:03.48
over and over again.

278
00:27:03.48 --> 00:27:11.44
We have more respect for human life now than we did then period.

279
00:27:11.44 --> 00:27:13.16
I don't care what anybody says.

280
00:27:13.16 --> 00:27:17.64
We have more respect for human life now than they did then.

281
00:27:17.64 --> 00:27:20.000
Maybe that means we're weaker.

282
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.88
Maybe it means we're more cowardly.

283
00:27:22.88 --> 00:27:32.12
Just to send millions of men to their death forever that didn't really have any strategic

284
00:27:32.12 --> 00:27:36.60
impact that that was true.

285
00:27:36.60 --> 00:27:47.20
It's horrible to think about.

286
00:27:47.20 --> 00:27:54.56
So now we're getting, I believe that for people to read the bulk of the middle of the

287
00:27:54.56 --> 00:27:57.28
book where he goes into these details.

288
00:27:57.28 --> 00:28:04.72
But then I kind of moving forward here more towards the end of the book.

289
00:28:04.72 --> 00:28:12.52
And now we're getting into these really pretty fierce battles and also what's interesting

290
00:28:12.52 --> 00:28:15.52
is this is when he starts seeing the enemy.

291
00:28:15.52 --> 00:28:21.52
They can hear him in the other trenches but now he starts meeting them face to face.

292
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:28.24
And indeed we heard on 29 November from Captain Von Brickson that we were that we were

293
00:28:28.24 --> 00:28:32.56
to take part in a sweeping counter offensive against the bolds that the tank battle at

294
00:28:32.56 --> 00:28:36.64
Cambre had made in our front.

295
00:28:36.64 --> 00:28:41.52
Even though we were pleased to play a part of the hammer having so long been the animal,

296
00:28:41.52 --> 00:28:47.64
we wondered whether the troops still exhausted from flanders would be up to the job.

297
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:50.04
That said I had every confidence in my company.

298
00:28:50.04 --> 00:28:53.52
They had never let anyone down yet.

299
00:28:53.52 --> 00:28:59.68
On the night of 30 November to one December we were put on low-reasons truck.

300
00:28:59.68 --> 00:29:05.60
In the process we took our first losses as a soldier dropped a hand grenade which for some

301
00:29:05.60 --> 00:29:10.24
reason exploded gravely injuring him in another man.

302
00:29:10.24 --> 00:29:16.44
Someone else famed insanity in an attempt to get out of the battle.

303
00:29:16.44 --> 00:29:23.24
After a lot of chewing and throwing a buffet in the ribs from an NCO seemed to sort him out

304
00:29:23.24 --> 00:29:25.52
and we were able to go.

305
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:32.76
It showed me that that sort of play acting is difficult to keep up.

306
00:29:32.76 --> 00:29:37.12
Now I've talked about this before and if you didn't go the last time I talked about it

307
00:29:37.12 --> 00:29:43.56
and look at the shell-shocked videos of World War I on YouTube, there are a rifick

308
00:29:43.56 --> 00:29:48.000
to watch and you realize what this war did to people.

309
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.72
I pulled this section out because he was a guy who probably had gone completely insane.

310
00:29:56.72 --> 00:30:00.64
He's like saying this guy famed insanity.

311
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:02.92
He just said you know what this guy's faking.

312
00:30:02.92 --> 00:30:05.80
Even though he probably was, he probably was.

313
00:30:05.80 --> 00:30:10.32
He says you know what beat this guy up, tell him to suck it up and now we can go and

314
00:30:10.32 --> 00:30:11.72
that's exactly what happened.

315
00:30:11.72 --> 00:30:13.28
That was kind of the attitude right?

316
00:30:13.28 --> 00:30:15.48
Remember you're saying that was kind of the attitude back then?

317
00:30:15.48 --> 00:30:18.12
It absolutely was the attitude.

318
00:30:18.12 --> 00:30:19.88
It was the attitude and they they talk about.

319
00:30:19.88 --> 00:30:25.72
I mean I've paid more attention to it on the British side but if you came back from the

320
00:30:25.72 --> 00:30:32.80
war with all your limbs and you went into a medical war, meaning you were in there

321
00:30:32.80 --> 00:30:35.44
because you had psychological problems.

322
00:30:35.44 --> 00:30:38.72
It was because you were a coward in their minds.

323
00:30:38.72 --> 00:30:44.52
Which is sick, it's sickening.

324
00:30:44.52 --> 00:30:50.20
Yeah I think how you were saying life meant less than or it means more like human life.

325
00:30:50.20 --> 00:30:53.56
I think it's just like it was just a lack of knowledge.

326
00:30:53.56 --> 00:30:56.44
They looked into it over the years and stuff and they kind of...

327
00:30:56.44 --> 00:31:00.80
Oh as far as the PTSD and the shell-shock everything.

328
00:31:00.80 --> 00:31:01.80
Absolutely.

329
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:03.96
We've learned all kinds about that.

330
00:31:03.96 --> 00:31:04.96
Yeah.

331
00:31:04.96 --> 00:31:13.60
But it is really horrible when you see those videos of what this war did to people.

332
00:31:13.60 --> 00:31:15.92
And that's what war does due to people.

333
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:23.52
We got to remember that that it impacts people in a horrible way.

334
00:31:23.52 --> 00:31:29.52
And this war, to me especially, more so than they were, primarily because of the conditions

335
00:31:29.52 --> 00:31:35.04
and from the indirect fire, the mortars and the shell-ing, and again it's something that

336
00:31:35.04 --> 00:31:36.84
you have no control over.

337
00:31:36.84 --> 00:31:41.04
And also you could see these guys had no control over their fate.

338
00:31:41.04 --> 00:31:44.68
They were going to get told to do something, they were going to do it.

339
00:31:44.68 --> 00:31:49.32
And if you weren't going to do it you were a coward.

340
00:31:49.32 --> 00:31:52.28
You know if you were to protest and say hey this doesn't seem like a good plan to me.

341
00:31:52.28 --> 00:31:54.76
It wouldn't be well okay what's your strategic opinion?

342
00:31:54.76 --> 00:31:57.40
Wouldn't your tactic, which your tactical brain tell you?

343
00:31:57.40 --> 00:31:59.40
No, no you're a coward.

344
00:31:59.40 --> 00:32:07.36
And that's why it's so important really in any endeavor, especially in a war, but in

345
00:32:07.36 --> 00:32:13.64
a war in business, to have an open mind from a leadership position, to listen to what

346
00:32:13.64 --> 00:32:18.16
people are saying because they might be right and here I guarantee there were thousands

347
00:32:18.16 --> 00:32:21.80
and thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of soldiers that would have said hey you know

348
00:32:21.80 --> 00:32:26.56
what this doesn't make any sense.

349
00:32:26.56 --> 00:32:30.88
And part of it isn't combing upon them to say you know what?

350
00:32:30.88 --> 00:32:34.04
No, I mean it's like we talked about with Napoleon's Maxim, right?

351
00:32:34.04 --> 00:32:39.20
Napoleon's Maxim was if you are aware of a problem with an order and you carried out

352
00:32:39.20 --> 00:32:42.92
and you get your guys killed you're culpable.

353
00:32:42.92 --> 00:32:48.76
So these guys obviously hadn't read that and hadn't taken that on board where you listened

354
00:32:48.76 --> 00:32:52.64
to your subordinates and you say okay what do you think of this plan?

355
00:32:52.64 --> 00:32:56.52
We've tried it 12 times in the past month and a half and we're going to try to get

356
00:32:56.52 --> 00:32:57.52
to tomorrow.

357
00:32:57.52 --> 00:32:59.64
We're going to get up at the sound of the whistle and we're going to charge towards

358
00:32:59.64 --> 00:33:01.56
these other enemy machine guns.

359
00:33:01.56 --> 00:33:05.56
It hasn't worked yet, but we think it might work tomorrow.

360
00:33:05.56 --> 00:33:10.32
No one figured that out?

361
00:33:10.32 --> 00:33:14.80
Listen to your people and listen to your brain.

362
00:33:14.80 --> 00:33:18.64
Listen to your common sense, don't get stuck.

363
00:33:18.64 --> 00:33:21.44
Don't get stuck in a mental rut.

364
00:33:21.44 --> 00:33:26.76
With anything and it's so easy to look if you could send millions of humans to their

365
00:33:26.76 --> 00:33:30.44
death because you can't think your way out of the strategy.

366
00:33:30.44 --> 00:33:32.72
You can't identify a strategy as being wrong.

367
00:33:32.72 --> 00:33:37.52
You can't come up with a new way to execute something.

368
00:33:37.52 --> 00:33:44.88
That shows you how trapped in a box your brain can get and not only you but your buddies

369
00:33:44.88 --> 00:33:48.28
that are all thinking the same way and you're all feeding off each other with ancestral

370
00:33:48.28 --> 00:33:58.92
ideals that are the same ideas being fed to one another and it leads to this.

371
00:33:58.92 --> 00:34:01.16
Back to the book.

372
00:34:01.16 --> 00:34:05.16
Suddenly there was some commotion at the British barricade.

373
00:34:05.16 --> 00:34:09.40
Hand grenades flew, rifles banged, machine guns clattered.

374
00:34:09.40 --> 00:34:10.40
They're coming.

375
00:34:10.40 --> 00:34:11.84
They're coming.

376
00:34:11.84 --> 00:34:15.08
We leaped behind sandbags and started shooting.

377
00:34:15.08 --> 00:34:21.36
In the heat of the battle, one of my men, Corporal Kimpin House, jumped onto the parapet

378
00:34:21.36 --> 00:34:26.88
and fired down into the trench until he was brought down by two bad wounds in his arms.

379
00:34:26.88 --> 00:34:32.20
I took note of this hero of the hour and was proud to congratulate him two weeks later

380
00:34:32.20 --> 00:34:37.72
on the ward of the Iron Cross first class.

381
00:34:37.72 --> 00:34:43.72
No sooner had we got back from this interruption to our lunch than there was more pandemonium.

382
00:34:43.72 --> 00:34:49.12
It was one of those curious incidents that can suddenly an unpredictably transform an entire

383
00:34:49.12 --> 00:34:51.48
situation.

384
00:34:51.48 --> 00:34:58.64
The noise was coming from a subaltern in the regiment on our left who wanted to line up with

385
00:34:58.64 --> 00:35:05.24
us and seemed inflamed by a berserk fury.

386
00:35:05.24 --> 00:35:10.44
Drink seemed to have tipped his innate bravery into towering rage.

387
00:35:10.44 --> 00:35:12.000
Where are the tomis?

388
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Let me add them.

389
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.44
Come on boys, who's coming with me?

390
00:35:16.44 --> 00:35:22.56
In his incident fury, he knocked over our fine barricade and plunged forward, clearing

391
00:35:22.56 --> 00:35:27.72
a path for himself with hand grenades.

392
00:35:27.72 --> 00:35:32.32
So this guy is, you know, going after it.

393
00:35:32.32 --> 00:35:36.72
He's, you know, he's described as being like almost drunk.

394
00:35:36.72 --> 00:35:45.84
Maybe he actually is drunk, but he's just standing up and charging.

395
00:35:45.84 --> 00:35:48.96
Charging forward, clearing a path for himself with hand grenades.

396
00:35:48.96 --> 00:35:49.96
Back to the book.

397
00:35:49.96 --> 00:35:53.52
His orderly slipped ahead of him along the trench shooting down anyone who survived

398
00:35:53.52 --> 00:35:55.12
the explosion.

399
00:35:55.12 --> 00:35:56.12
Explosions.

400
00:35:56.12 --> 00:36:01.96
Bravely, bravery, fearless risking of one's own life is always inspiring.

401
00:36:01.96 --> 00:36:09.04
Be too found ourselves picked up by his wild fury and scrambling around to grab a few hand

402
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:14.52
grenades rushed to form part of this berserkers' project progress.

403
00:36:14.52 --> 00:36:19.96
Soon I was up alongside him, tearing along the line, and the other officers too, followed

404
00:36:19.96 --> 00:36:24.36
by riflemen from my company.

405
00:36:24.36 --> 00:36:29.68
Even Captain von Brickson, the battalion commander, was up there in the van, rifle and

406
00:36:29.68 --> 00:36:34.56
hand bringing down enemy hand grenade throwers.

407
00:36:34.56 --> 00:36:37.08
The British resisted manfully.

408
00:36:37.08 --> 00:36:41.08
Every traverse had to be fought for.

409
00:36:41.08 --> 00:36:46.60
The black balls of millilose bombs as a British grenades crossed in the air with our own

410
00:36:46.60 --> 00:36:49.20
long handled grenades.

411
00:36:49.20 --> 00:36:54.56
Behind every traverse we captured, we found corpses or bodies still twitching.

412
00:36:54.56 --> 00:36:58.80
We kill each other sight unseen.

413
00:36:58.80 --> 00:37:01.52
We too suffered losses.

414
00:37:01.52 --> 00:37:06.96
A piece of iron crashed into the ground next to the orderly, which the fellow was unable

415
00:37:06.96 --> 00:37:12.72
to avoid and he collapsed the ground while his blood issued onto the clay from his many

416
00:37:12.72 --> 00:37:14.72
wounds.

417
00:37:14.72 --> 00:37:19.08
We heard a lot of his body and charged forwards.

418
00:37:19.08 --> 00:37:22.08
Fundress crashes pointed us the way.

419
00:37:22.08 --> 00:37:26.60
Hundreds of pairs of eyes were lying in weight behind rifles and machine guns in dead

420
00:37:26.60 --> 00:37:29.04
man's land.

421
00:37:29.04 --> 00:37:34.20
We were already a long way from our own front lines.

422
00:37:34.20 --> 00:37:39.16
From all sides bullets whistled round our steel helmets or struck the trench parapet with

423
00:37:39.16 --> 00:37:40.60
a hard crack.

424
00:37:40.60 --> 00:37:48.28
Each time a black iron oval broke the horizon, one's eyes sized it up with that instantaneous

425
00:37:48.28 --> 00:37:55.64
clarity of which a man is only capable in moments of life and death.

426
00:37:55.64 --> 00:38:00.72
During those instances of waiting, you had to try and get to a place where you could see

427
00:38:00.72 --> 00:38:06.08
as much of the sky as possible because it was only against its pale backdrop that it

428
00:38:06.08 --> 00:38:13.96
was possible to see the black jagged iron of those deadly balls with sufficient clarity.

429
00:38:13.96 --> 00:38:18.32
Then you hurled your own bomb and leaked forward.

430
00:38:18.32 --> 00:38:22.76
One barely glanced at the crumpled body of one's opponents.

431
00:38:22.76 --> 00:38:27.20
He was finished and a new duel was commencing.

432
00:38:27.20 --> 00:38:33.28
In the exchange of hand grenades, it reminded me of fencing with foils you needed to jump

433
00:38:33.28 --> 00:38:37.20
and stretch almost as in a ballet.

434
00:38:37.20 --> 00:38:43.68
It is the deadliest of duels, as it invariably ends with one of the participants or the

435
00:38:43.68 --> 00:38:59.72
other being blown to smithereens or both hand grenade fights.

436
00:38:59.72 --> 00:39:04.28
Just to explain that a little bit, it's one thing that we definitely learned in the

437
00:39:04.28 --> 00:39:08.92
seal teams when you're patrolling at night and especially before night vision.

438
00:39:08.92 --> 00:39:12.92
When you wanted to see the person in front of you and especially to see their hand signals

439
00:39:12.92 --> 00:39:15.64
because we use all hand signals at night.

440
00:39:15.64 --> 00:39:21.84
If you want to see them, you get down on a knee and you put the back light behind them

441
00:39:21.84 --> 00:39:23.88
so you can see what hand signal they're passing.

442
00:39:23.88 --> 00:39:28.04
What he's doing here is they're trying to get as low as they can and backlight the sky

443
00:39:28.04 --> 00:39:34.28
as much as they can so they can see the grenades that are being thrown at them.

444
00:39:34.28 --> 00:39:37.32
Then when they do get thrown out of them, they try and get up to a spot where they don't

445
00:39:37.32 --> 00:39:40.96
think it's going to blow up and then they're huck their own grenades back.

446
00:39:40.96 --> 00:39:48.80
In these moments, I was capable of seeing the dead.

447
00:39:48.80 --> 00:39:55.68
I jumped over them with every stride without horror.

448
00:39:55.68 --> 00:40:02.16
They lay there in their relaxed and softly spilled attitude that characterizes those

449
00:40:02.16 --> 00:40:09.16
moments in which life takes its leave.

450
00:40:09.16 --> 00:40:16.36
Now they get the British kind of trapped.

451
00:40:16.36 --> 00:40:21.32
The trench they were trying to escape down double back on itself towards ours like a curved

452
00:40:21.32 --> 00:40:28.16
frame of a lear and at the narrowest point, they were only ten paces apart so they had

453
00:40:28.16 --> 00:40:29.68
to pass us again.

454
00:40:29.68 --> 00:40:34.16
From our elevated position, we were able to look down on the British helmets as they stumbled

455
00:40:34.16 --> 00:40:36.36
in their haste and excitement.

456
00:40:36.36 --> 00:40:40.68
I tossed a hand grenade in front of the first lot, bringing them up short.

457
00:40:40.68 --> 00:40:47.60
And after them, all the others, then they were stuck in a frightful jam.

458
00:40:47.60 --> 00:40:53.96
Hand grenades flew through the air like snowballs covering everything in milk-white smoke.

459
00:40:53.96 --> 00:40:57.28
Fresh bombs were handed up to us from below.

460
00:40:57.28 --> 00:41:02.68
Lightening's flashed between the huddle to British, hurling up rags of flesh and uniforms

461
00:41:02.68 --> 00:41:05.76
and helmets.

462
00:41:05.76 --> 00:41:10.64
They were mingled cries of rage and fear.

463
00:41:10.64 --> 00:41:16.68
With fire in our eyes we jumped onto the very lip of the trench.

464
00:41:16.68 --> 00:41:20.64
The rifles of the whole area were pointed at us.

465
00:41:20.64 --> 00:41:26.60
Suddenly in my delirium, I was knocked to the ground as by a hammer below.

466
00:41:26.60 --> 00:41:32.44
Sober, I pulled off my helmet and saw to my tear that there were two large holes in it.

467
00:41:32.44 --> 00:41:37.24
To that Mormon, leaping up to assist me, assured me that I had a bleeding scratch at the

468
00:41:37.24 --> 00:41:39.64
back of my head nothing more.

469
00:41:39.64 --> 00:41:44.80
A bullet shot from some distance had punched through my helmet and it only brushed my

470
00:41:44.80 --> 00:41:47.24
skull.

471
00:41:47.24 --> 00:41:52.68
Half unconscious, I reeled back with a hurriedly applied bandage to remove myself from the eye

472
00:41:52.68 --> 00:41:55.28
of the storm.

473
00:41:55.28 --> 00:42:00.76
No sooner had I passed the nearest reverse than a man ran up behind me and told me that

474
00:42:00.76 --> 00:42:07.80
tab had just been killed in the same place by a shot in the head.

475
00:42:07.80 --> 00:42:10.44
The news floored me.

476
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:16.36
A friend of mine with noble qualities with whom I had shared joy, sorrow and danger for

477
00:42:16.36 --> 00:42:18.08
years now.

478
00:42:18.08 --> 00:42:24.76
Who only a few moments ago had called out some pleasantry to me, taken from life by a tiny

479
00:42:24.76 --> 00:42:28.44
piece of lead.

480
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:32.92
I could not grasp the fact.

481
00:42:32.92 --> 00:42:38.68
Unfortunately, it was all too true.

482
00:42:38.68 --> 00:42:43.96
In this murderous sector of trench, all my NCOs and a third of my company were bleeding

483
00:42:43.96 --> 00:42:45.96
to death.

484
00:42:45.96 --> 00:42:47.76
Shots in the head rained down.

485
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:52.32
Lieutenant Hopphan and another one was another one of the fallen.

486
00:42:52.32 --> 00:42:59.16
An older man, a teacher by profession, a German schoolmaster in the best sense of the word.

487
00:42:59.16 --> 00:43:03.92
My two engines and many others besides were wounded.

488
00:43:03.92 --> 00:43:09.36
And yet the seventh company held onto the conquered line under the command of Lieutenant

489
00:43:09.36 --> 00:43:17.60
Hopphan Raff, the only able-bodied officer remaining until he relieved.

490
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:21.84
Of all the stimulating moments in a war.

491
00:43:21.84 --> 00:43:28.32
There is none to compare with the encounter of two stormtroop commanders in the narrow clay

492
00:43:28.32 --> 00:43:32.000
walls of a line.

493
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.12
There is no going back and no pity.

494
00:43:37.12 --> 00:43:43.84
And everyone knows who is seen of them in their kingdom.

495
00:43:43.84 --> 00:43:50.60
The aristocrat of the trench with hard determined visage brave to the point of

496
00:43:50.60 --> 00:43:58.32
the folly, leaping adually forward and back with keen bloodthirsty eyes, men who answered

497
00:43:58.32 --> 00:44:01.76
the demands of the hour.

498
00:44:01.76 --> 00:44:15.04
And whose names go down in no chronicle.

499
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:22.76
And I think as we read these books, these books, these are chronicles.

500
00:44:22.76 --> 00:44:32.64
Somebody wrote this guy lived and wrote, but he's making a specific point here.

501
00:44:32.64 --> 00:44:35.36
He uses the term the aristocrat of the trench.

502
00:44:35.36 --> 00:44:39.56
It's not the term aristocrat.

503
00:44:39.56 --> 00:44:43.36
It's not the snobby aristocrat.

504
00:44:43.36 --> 00:44:44.36
That's not what he's talking about.

505
00:44:44.36 --> 00:44:47.88
So you look up the definition of a aristocrat and one of the meanings of it is like

506
00:44:47.88 --> 00:44:50.68
the best of.

507
00:44:50.68 --> 00:44:57.68
So I just want to talk about these guys that were the best guys in the trench that had

508
00:44:57.68 --> 00:45:04.16
the hard look that would get after it.

509
00:45:04.16 --> 00:45:06.52
And yet their names go down in no chronicle.

510
00:45:06.52 --> 00:45:14.24
And I'll tell you, I know many, many brave men.

511
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:23.32
In the seal teams, in the Marine Corps, in the Army, brave souls that were aristocrats

512
00:45:23.32 --> 00:45:27.04
of war.

513
00:45:27.04 --> 00:45:34.32
And their name will go down in no chronicle.

514
00:45:34.32 --> 00:45:36.000
A later battle.

515
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.20
Two men who had just ahead of us tried to make it back over the top, one toppled back

516
00:45:42.20 --> 00:45:47.24
into the trench with a shot in the head, the other shot in the belly could only crawl

517
00:45:47.24 --> 00:45:49.04
into it.

518
00:45:49.04 --> 00:45:53.04
We hunkered down on the floor to wait and smoked English cigarettes.

519
00:45:53.04 --> 00:45:57.56
From time to time, well-aimed rifle grenades came flying over.

520
00:45:57.56 --> 00:46:01.80
We were able to see them and take avasive action.

521
00:46:01.80 --> 00:46:08.24
The man with the wound in the belly, a very young lad lay in amongst us, stretched out

522
00:46:08.24 --> 00:46:14.000
like a cat in the warm rays of the setting sun.

523
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.56
He slipped into death with an almost childlike smile on his face.

524
00:46:20.56 --> 00:46:26.000
It was a sight that didn't oppress me, but left me with a fraternal feeling for the dying

525
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.64
man.

526
00:46:28.64 --> 00:46:35.08
Even the groaning of his comrade, gradually fell silent.

527
00:46:35.08 --> 00:46:44.000
He died in our midst, shuddering.

528
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.84
It's that line there really caught me.

529
00:46:48.84 --> 00:46:52.52
Where he died in our midst, shuddering.

530
00:46:52.52 --> 00:46:57.88
And it's, I think, what catches you about it's because the other, it's contrasted with

531
00:46:57.88 --> 00:47:05.04
the other one who died with an almost childlike smile on his face.

532
00:47:05.04 --> 00:47:09.64
And you know what I was thinking when you see this much death, it's like when they say

533
00:47:09.64 --> 00:47:16.36
the eskimos have thousand words for snow because they're so familiar with snow.

534
00:47:16.36 --> 00:47:26.84
And these men were faced with so much death that they saw the varied faces of death.

535
00:47:26.84 --> 00:47:30.28
And how different they are.

536
00:47:30.28 --> 00:47:34.32
And you know, one thing that I remember from some of the older Vietnam seals talking

537
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:39.20
to me about guys that have been wounded, this is, you know, in the 90s.

538
00:47:39.20 --> 00:47:42.64
So I had no idea anything about combat.

539
00:47:42.64 --> 00:47:46.08
And I remember like they were telling me, hey, you know, sometimes guys get wounded,

540
00:47:46.08 --> 00:47:50.92
big shot and it does, it does, it does, it does not phase them.

541
00:47:50.92 --> 00:47:56.36
And it's part of it's the physiology, like if you get shot in a certain place, it just

542
00:47:56.36 --> 00:47:58.72
doesn't, it just doesn't do anything.

543
00:47:58.72 --> 00:48:00.48
You can, you can drive on.

544
00:48:00.48 --> 00:48:04.000
And then you'll have someone else get shot in a different place.

545
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.56
And it just, there's nothing you can do about it.

546
00:48:05.56 --> 00:48:10.52
Like it blows their femur apart or it hits their hip in such a way that they cannot.

547
00:48:10.52 --> 00:48:15.52
They're just down and in agonizing pain, whereas someone else may get shot on a through

548
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:18.88
and through, meaning it just goes in one side and out the other.

549
00:48:18.88 --> 00:48:20.56
And it's almost like they don't even notice it.

550
00:48:20.56 --> 00:48:21.56
Yeah.

551
00:48:21.56 --> 00:48:22.80
Because it happens so fast.

552
00:48:22.80 --> 00:48:25.28
Happened so fast and it doesn't cause any traumatic damage.

553
00:48:25.28 --> 00:48:29.68
And then you have the psychological aspect where some people psychologically, they get hit

554
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:30.68
and they're freaking out.

555
00:48:30.68 --> 00:48:33.12
Oh my god, I'm going to die.

556
00:48:33.12 --> 00:48:35.60
And some other people are, you know, I got hit, just leave me alone.

557
00:48:35.60 --> 00:48:36.60
Hey, I got this.

558
00:48:36.60 --> 00:48:37.60
Don't worry about me.

559
00:48:37.60 --> 00:48:39.04
I ain't got time to bleed.

560
00:48:39.04 --> 00:48:40.04
Yeah.

561
00:48:40.04 --> 00:48:45.36
So, those are some situations that, you know, are just different.

562
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:46.68
And then it's the same thing.

563
00:48:46.68 --> 00:48:57.04
Obviously, when this guy sees death after death after death, after death, he sees the variables

564
00:48:57.04 --> 00:48:59.48
and the various faces of death.

565
00:48:59.48 --> 00:49:10.16
So, so now we're getting towards the end.

566
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:16.72
And I mean, this is at a point now where they're starting to recognize that they're

567
00:49:16.72 --> 00:49:20.56
going to lose the war.

568
00:49:20.56 --> 00:49:26.000
And what's crazy about that is, now, okay, if you tell me, hey, we're fighting for our country,

569
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
okay, I get it.

570
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.36
We're going to drive on, maybe we're going to make some sacrifices.

571
00:49:29.36 --> 00:49:38.24
These guys now recognize that they're probably not going to win.

572
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:43.44
And he's kind of given his guys a brief before they go into another assault.

573
00:49:43.44 --> 00:49:49.12
I paraded my company in battle order in a small apple orchard.

574
00:49:49.12 --> 00:49:54.64
Standing under an apple tree, I addressed a few words to the men who were drawn up in front

575
00:49:54.64 --> 00:49:58.08
of me in a horseshoe arrangement.

576
00:49:58.08 --> 00:50:01.96
They looked serious and manly.

577
00:50:01.96 --> 00:50:04.72
There wasn't much to say.

578
00:50:04.72 --> 00:50:10.72
In the course of the last few days and with a kind of sweetness that is only to be explained

579
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:18.40
by the fact that an army is not only men under arms, but also men fused with a sense

580
00:50:18.40 --> 00:50:21.20
of common purpose.

581
00:50:21.20 --> 00:50:28.60
Probably every one of them had come to understand that we were on our upper's and on

582
00:50:28.60 --> 00:50:34.40
our upper's is an expression that means it's like when you're in poverty or when you

583
00:50:34.40 --> 00:50:36.08
don't have the means anymore.

584
00:50:36.08 --> 00:50:39.32
So they knew he knew that they were on their last legs.

585
00:50:39.32 --> 00:50:43.000
They knew that they were on their last legs.

586
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.76
He goes on with every attack.

587
00:50:45.76 --> 00:50:54.92
The enemy came forward with more powerful means, his blows were swifter and more devastating.

588
00:50:54.92 --> 00:51:12.96
Everyone knew we could no longer win, but we would stand firm.

589
00:51:12.96 --> 00:51:16.48
We would stand firm.

590
00:51:16.48 --> 00:51:21.04
Now they're in his final battle.

591
00:51:21.04 --> 00:51:28.08
I had a very impartial feeling as if I were able to view myself through binoculars.

592
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:31.08
You can see he's now becoming detached.

593
00:51:31.08 --> 00:51:36.44
For the first time in the entire war, I heard the hissing of individual bullets as if

594
00:51:36.44 --> 00:51:40.08
they were whistling past some target.

595
00:51:40.08 --> 00:51:46.32
We were coming downhill, indistinct figures moved against the background of a red brown

596
00:51:46.32 --> 00:51:47.32
clay.

597
00:51:47.32 --> 00:51:55.08
A machine gun spat out its gouts of bullets, the feeling of hopelessness increased.

598
00:51:55.08 --> 00:52:01.16
Even so we broken to Iran while the gunners were finding their range.

599
00:52:01.16 --> 00:52:08.08
We jumped over several snipers' nests and hurriedly excavated trenches.

600
00:52:08.08 --> 00:52:14.60
In mid-Jump, over a slightly better-made trench, I felt a piercing jolt in the chest, as though

601
00:52:14.60 --> 00:52:17.76
I'd been hit like a game bird.

602
00:52:17.76 --> 00:52:24.64
With a sharp cry that seemed to cost me all the air I had, I spun on my axis and crashed

603
00:52:24.64 --> 00:52:27.36
to the ground.

604
00:52:27.36 --> 00:52:30.56
It hit got me at last.

605
00:52:30.56 --> 00:52:37.92
At the same time as feeling I had been hit, I felt the bullet taking away my life.

606
00:52:37.92 --> 00:52:46.24
I had felt death's hand once before on the road at Mori, but this time his grip was firmer

607
00:52:46.24 --> 00:52:49.28
and more determined.

608
00:52:49.28 --> 00:52:56.40
As I came down heavily on the bottom of the trench, I was convinced it was all over.

609
00:52:56.40 --> 00:53:04.36
Strangely, that moment is one of the very few in my life of which I am able to say, they

610
00:53:04.36 --> 00:53:07.28
were utterly happy.

611
00:53:07.28 --> 00:53:16.24
I understood as in a flash of lightning, the true inner purpose and form of my life.

612
00:53:16.24 --> 00:53:24.48
I felt surprise and disbelief that it was to end there and then, but this surprise had

613
00:53:24.48 --> 00:53:30.88
something untrubbled and almost merry about it.

614
00:53:30.88 --> 00:53:39.40
And I heard the firing grow less as if I were a stone sinking under the surface of some

615
00:53:39.40 --> 00:53:43.36
turbulent water.

616
00:53:43.36 --> 00:53:59.92
Where I was going, there was neither war nor enmity.

617
00:53:59.92 --> 00:54:07.44
So obviously he did survive that wounding because he was able to write this book and

618
00:54:07.44 --> 00:54:14.12
you wrote many other books.

619
00:54:14.12 --> 00:54:35.76
The book is called Storm of Steel by Ernst E. Younger.

620
00:54:35.76 --> 00:54:46.48
And as I wrap up these books, sometimes I feel like, hey, where do I compare this?

621
00:54:46.48 --> 00:54:50.32
How do I tie it in?

622
00:54:50.32 --> 00:54:56.04
And I mean obviously there's lessons and leadership and strategy and I talk a little bit

623
00:54:56.04 --> 00:55:05.88
about listening to your troops and keeping an open mind.

624
00:55:05.88 --> 00:55:17.04
Even though they started off and the description of this book is saying, there's no pacifists

625
00:55:17.04 --> 00:55:23.28
leaning in this book.

626
00:55:23.28 --> 00:55:37.08
Something that I often remind people about the guys that have fought wars.

627
00:55:37.08 --> 00:55:51.60
Is that if there's anybody that looks at war and says, let's try to avoid it if we can.

628
00:55:51.60 --> 00:55:53.68
That's the guys that have been there.

629
00:55:53.68 --> 00:55:56.64
The guys that have fought.

630
00:55:56.64 --> 00:56:04.44
We don't want to send our friends to war, we don't want to send kids to war.

631
00:56:04.44 --> 00:56:18.44
And I think this book is a reminder of just how bad it can be and just how horrible a thing

632
00:56:18.44 --> 00:56:23.000
that war is.

633
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.56
Now of course that always comes with the caveat of the fact that there are things that

634
00:56:28.56 --> 00:56:32.60
are more evil than war.

635
00:56:32.60 --> 00:56:34.56
And there are things that can only be stopped.

636
00:56:34.56 --> 00:56:44.92
There is evil that can only be stopped through the waging of war.

637
00:56:44.92 --> 00:56:54.08
But when you do have to go to war because the evil must be stopped, then go to war

638
00:56:54.08 --> 00:57:00.000
to win and win decisively.

639
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:20.52
So you don't put men through horrors for nothing.

640
00:57:20.52 --> 00:57:25.88
Going back to the part where you're talking about guys getting hit and they deal with

641
00:57:25.88 --> 00:57:31.12
different people just have different reactions.

642
00:57:31.12 --> 00:57:34.68
When it's that kind of bill like a bullet happened so fast, I don't think your nerves

643
00:57:34.68 --> 00:57:35.68
really register.

644
00:57:35.68 --> 00:57:39.80
It just depends on where you hit because your bullet could go through your arm and you

645
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:43.28
don't notice it or go through your arm and hit your bone.

646
00:57:43.28 --> 00:57:44.28
Or the nerve.

647
00:57:44.28 --> 00:57:46.08
Or like graze the bone.

648
00:57:46.08 --> 00:57:47.08
Yeah, it could hit the bone.

649
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:48.08
It could shout out of the bone.

650
00:57:48.08 --> 00:57:54.48
I saw guys that got hit in the bone and it's devastating.

651
00:57:54.48 --> 00:57:57.24
And you see guys that got through and through and they're fine.

652
00:57:57.24 --> 00:57:59.36
They're literally fine.

653
00:57:59.36 --> 00:58:08.16
And so war is a huge element of chance in it.

654
00:58:08.16 --> 00:58:11.68
And you know I actually got there's an internet question that I got asked and I didn't

655
00:58:11.68 --> 00:58:14.28
I don't think we brought it up.

656
00:58:14.28 --> 00:58:18.92
But it's basically somebody saying how do you deal with the randomness of war?

657
00:58:18.92 --> 00:58:22.28
Like you could just have a idea of what the randomness of war.

658
00:58:22.28 --> 00:58:28.08
And for me it's the way I dealt with the randomness of war is the really simple thought

659
00:58:28.08 --> 00:58:31.32
of I'm going to control what I can control.

660
00:58:31.32 --> 00:58:34.44
And if I can't control it, I'm not going to worry about it.

661
00:58:34.44 --> 00:58:37.16
You can't worry about the random sniper shot.

662
00:58:37.16 --> 00:58:39.88
I mean, you can do everything you can to mitigate it.

663
00:58:39.88 --> 00:58:43.84
You know when you're out there in the field, you keep moving, moving, you stay behind

664
00:58:43.84 --> 00:58:44.96
the cover as much as you can.

665
00:58:44.96 --> 00:58:47.08
You don't come up in the same spot over and over again.

666
00:58:47.08 --> 00:58:50.72
You do the things to mitigate the risk.

667
00:58:50.72 --> 00:58:55.52
But you can't just be dwelling on it because you can't control it.

668
00:58:55.52 --> 00:58:56.52
Yeah.

669
00:58:56.52 --> 00:59:02.12
The same thing we're getting hit with a random ID or a random indirect fire from a mortar.

670
00:59:02.12 --> 00:59:05.88
You cannot mitigate all that risk.

671
00:59:05.88 --> 00:59:07.32
So what do you do?

672
00:59:07.32 --> 00:59:10.88
You do everything you can to mitigate it.

673
00:59:10.88 --> 00:59:13.64
And then you know you worry about the things you can control.

674
00:59:13.64 --> 00:59:16.80
And I used to tell that to MMA fighters too and I've told that story before you know

675
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:19.60
listen guys you're getting worried they're going to get knocked out or they're going

676
00:59:19.60 --> 00:59:21.08
to get caught in a submission.

677
00:59:21.08 --> 00:59:24.04
It's like hey, you've done everything you can to mitigate that.

678
00:59:24.04 --> 00:59:28.44
You've trained, you've conditioned yourself, you've spared, you've done meds.

679
00:59:28.44 --> 00:59:30.88
You've done everything that you can do.

680
00:59:30.88 --> 00:59:33.32
If that happens, you can't control it.

681
00:59:33.32 --> 00:59:34.80
If it happens, you can't control it.

682
00:59:34.80 --> 00:59:36.52
So don't even worry about it.

683
00:59:36.52 --> 00:59:40.04
We're worried about the things you can control the pace of the fight, putting the fight

684
00:59:40.04 --> 00:59:43.64
where you want it to be, winning the rounds, being a tactician.

685
00:59:43.64 --> 00:59:45.52
We're worried about those things.

686
00:59:45.52 --> 00:59:47.12
Don't worry about getting knocked out.

687
00:59:47.12 --> 00:59:48.12
You know what?

688
00:59:48.12 --> 00:59:49.56
Keep your hands up.

689
00:59:49.56 --> 00:59:51.28
Keep your head movement.

690
00:59:51.28 --> 00:59:52.88
Keep the distance in correct.

691
00:59:52.88 --> 00:59:55.24
Those are the things that are going to keep you from getting knocked out.

692
00:59:55.24 --> 00:59:58.80
But you can't mitigate all that risk you're in a fist fight.

693
00:59:58.80 --> 01:00:01.68
And in a fist fight, some people sometimes people get won't knock out.

694
01:00:01.68 --> 01:00:08.04
And in a war, sometimes people get wounded and sometimes people get killed.

695
01:00:08.04 --> 01:00:10.68
And you cannot mitigate that risk away.

696
01:00:10.68 --> 01:00:12.44
It's a war.

697
01:00:12.44 --> 01:00:14.44
And you've got to deal with it.

698
01:00:14.44 --> 01:00:20.64
Remember, this is going to be a kind of funny, comparatively speaking, but I shot my own

699
01:00:20.64 --> 01:00:21.64
hand one time.

700
01:00:21.64 --> 01:00:22.64
What?

701
01:00:22.64 --> 01:00:23.64
But BB gun.

702
01:00:23.64 --> 01:00:26.28
You don't have to tell the story about the public.

703
01:00:26.28 --> 01:00:29.68
There's a lesson in there, though.

704
01:00:29.68 --> 01:00:30.68
Okay.

705
01:00:30.68 --> 01:00:31.68
It's not even a lesson.

706
01:00:31.68 --> 01:00:34.04
It's like, let us don't shoot your hand with a gun.

707
01:00:34.04 --> 01:00:35.04
Yeah, it was done.

708
01:00:35.04 --> 01:00:37.56
It was one of those ones where, you know, you put the CO2 in.

709
01:00:37.56 --> 01:00:40.20
So I just changed the CO2 cartridge.

710
01:00:40.20 --> 01:00:42.40
And I was like, hey, there's no BBs in here.

711
01:00:42.40 --> 01:00:46.28
So I'm going to see just how strong does this air feel?

712
01:00:46.28 --> 01:00:48.44
You know, with that brand new CO2.

713
01:00:48.44 --> 01:00:51.000
And there's a BB in there.

714
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
And so a shot it and I didn't feel anything.

715
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.48
That's the weird thing is what I say.

716
01:00:55.48 --> 01:01:00.44
So when I shot it and when the BB went and it went deep in there, went in, I didn't see

717
01:01:00.44 --> 01:01:03.60
it and then I saw this little kind of like a little ring, you know, like a little tab

718
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:05.000
of skin just appeared.

719
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.64
And I was like, what?

720
01:01:06.64 --> 01:01:07.64
You know, like I felt the air.

721
01:01:07.64 --> 01:01:08.96
I was like, that's some pretty strong air.

722
01:01:08.96 --> 01:01:13.20
And then kind of, you know, a few seconds went by and I feel just this pressure.

723
01:01:13.20 --> 01:01:16.80
Like someone's like kind of squeezing my hand a little bit with their fingers.

724
01:01:16.80 --> 01:01:19.52
And I was like kind of confused.

725
01:01:19.52 --> 01:01:21.20
Because I, of course, I didn't.

726
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:22.20
There was no BB in there.

727
01:01:22.20 --> 01:01:23.20
I knew that from the beginning.

728
01:01:23.20 --> 01:01:25.20
And I don't, I don't know if you're going to be painting.

729
01:01:25.20 --> 01:01:26.20
You know that.

730
01:01:26.20 --> 01:01:27.20
But right.

731
01:01:27.20 --> 01:01:29.20
Yeah, I'm saying that's the thing.

732
01:01:29.20 --> 01:01:34.20
And then maybe, you know, maybe 10 seconds or so, it just starts gushing blood.

733
01:01:34.20 --> 01:01:36.84
And it comes to real, I'm a, but no pain.

734
01:01:36.84 --> 01:01:41.28
And you know, and I kind of like, you start kind of blacken out.

735
01:01:41.28 --> 01:01:43.32
I think it was, I was like 12 years old.

736
01:01:43.32 --> 01:01:44.88
I start kind of blacken out.

737
01:01:44.88 --> 01:01:51.44
And what happened was the BB went through and got lodged in my tendons.

738
01:01:51.44 --> 01:01:52.44
Under there.

739
01:01:52.44 --> 01:01:54.76
So it took like three surgeries to get it out.

740
01:01:54.76 --> 01:01:56.12
You know, the first one he just reached in there.

741
01:01:56.12 --> 01:01:59.000
Second one he cut a little bit and the third one.

742
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.40
They just cut my hand open.

743
01:02:00.40 --> 01:02:04.32
They had to like move the tendons to the side and like grab it.

744
01:02:04.32 --> 01:02:05.32
It's bad.

745
01:02:05.32 --> 01:02:06.80
But the point is there was no pain.

746
01:02:06.80 --> 01:02:07.80
Yeah.

747
01:02:07.80 --> 01:02:09.20
Because it just happens so fast, you know.

748
01:02:09.20 --> 01:02:10.36
Actually, that's one point.

749
01:02:10.36 --> 01:02:12.96
The other point is always treat weapons as if they're loaded.

750
01:02:12.96 --> 01:02:14.20
Oh, yeah.

751
01:02:14.20 --> 01:02:16.60
And never point a weapon at anything you don't intend to destroy.

752
01:02:16.60 --> 01:02:18.08
Well, we know that now.

753
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:20.08
I'm just, I was really nervous.

754
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:21.08
Yeah.

755
01:02:21.08 --> 01:02:22.08
Yeah.

756
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:23.08
Yeah.

757
01:02:23.08 --> 01:02:24.08
First of all, we got some young listeners out there.

758
01:02:24.08 --> 01:02:25.08
Yeah.

759
01:02:25.08 --> 01:02:26.52
Don't point guns at your hands and pull the trigger.

760
01:02:26.52 --> 01:02:27.52
Yeah.

761
01:02:27.52 --> 01:02:29.56
That's actually always treat weapons as if they're loaded.

762
01:02:29.56 --> 01:02:32.24
And never aim a weapon at anything you don't intend to destroy.

763
01:02:32.24 --> 01:02:33.24
Period.

764
01:02:33.24 --> 01:02:36.52
Those are like the official, like when you, if you go through like a gun course, something

765
01:02:36.52 --> 01:02:39.000
like those are, that's the first thing.

766
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Yeah.

767
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Interesting.

768
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Well, you see all the training.

769
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.52
So it's a little bit more heavy than a gun course.

770
01:02:45.52 --> 01:02:48.72
The basic principles of gun safety do not change.

771
01:02:48.72 --> 01:02:49.72
Yeah.

772
01:02:49.72 --> 01:02:50.72
And they should not change.

773
01:02:50.72 --> 01:02:51.72
Yeah.

774
01:02:51.72 --> 01:02:52.44
I wish I wouldn't know that when I was 12.

775
01:02:52.44 --> 01:02:52.72
Thank you.

776
01:02:57.04 --> 01:03:02.60
I think it's time for some questions from the interwebs.

777
01:03:02.60 --> 01:03:03.60
Yes.

778
01:03:03.60 --> 01:03:05.04
Questions from the interwebs.

779
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:12.80
Speaking of interwebs, we are in fact supported by onit.com.

780
01:03:12.80 --> 01:03:18.24

781
01:03:18.24 --> 01:03:22.92

A lot of extensive information on there too.

783
01:03:25.04 --> 01:03:26.52

785
01:03:28.16 --> 01:03:29.16
Yeah.

You can also get like kettlebells and corbells, which I have, in which I utilize.

787
01:03:34.72 --> 01:03:35.72

Yes.

789
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:37.72
Stentively.

790
01:03:37.72 --> 01:03:40.72
And not just normal kettlebells either.

791
01:03:40.72 --> 01:03:41.72
Yeah.

792
01:03:41.72 --> 01:03:42.72
Let's just say that.

793
01:03:42.72 --> 01:03:43.72
Yeah.

794
01:03:43.72 --> 01:03:44.72
That's true.

01:03:58.72 --> 01:03:59.72
What not?

804
01:03:59.72 --> 01:04:00.72
Anyway, yeah.

805
01:04:00.72 --> 01:04:02.72
Do it.

806
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:07.48
First question.

807
01:04:07.48 --> 01:04:12.32
Can you talk about your training schedules, roles, which is jujitsu training sessions?

808
01:04:12.32 --> 01:04:13.96
What's that for me?

809
01:04:13.96 --> 01:04:16.32
You explained to me what roles is?

810
01:04:16.32 --> 01:04:17.32
For everyone.

811
01:04:17.32 --> 01:04:18.32
All right.

812
01:04:18.32 --> 01:04:19.32
In the event of them not knowing.

813
01:04:19.32 --> 01:04:20.72
We'd be rolled in there.

814
01:04:20.72 --> 01:04:25.52
So can you talk about your training schedules, your roles, and what is a typical week?

815
01:04:25.52 --> 01:04:27.72
What is that look like?

816
01:04:27.72 --> 01:04:32.68
Well, for me, you know, I work out everyday.

817
01:04:32.68 --> 01:04:36.04
So what that means every morning I wake up early and I get it on.

818
01:04:36.04 --> 01:04:42.92
I lift weights, I do calisthenics, I do some kind of sprinting evolution seven days a week,

819
01:04:42.92 --> 01:04:49.40
seven days a week and as I've explained to many people on the Twitter, they say don't you

820
01:04:49.40 --> 01:04:50.92
ever take a day off and I do.

821
01:04:50.92 --> 01:04:52.92
But I don't plan to take days off.

822
01:04:52.92 --> 01:04:53.92
Days off.

823
01:04:53.92 --> 01:04:56.12
Life brings days off.

824
01:04:56.12 --> 01:04:58.16
You got the broken water heater.

825
01:04:58.16 --> 01:04:59.80
You got the sick kids.

826
01:04:59.80 --> 01:05:01.40
You got sick.

827
01:05:01.40 --> 01:05:04.68
You got the car broke down.

828
01:05:04.68 --> 01:05:06.20
You got the event at school.

829
01:05:06.20 --> 01:05:07.56
Whatever it is.

830
01:05:07.56 --> 01:05:08.80
Some there's some reason.

831
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:11.12
There's some travel plans that don't allow it.

832
01:05:11.12 --> 01:05:13.80
So there's life will give you days off.

833
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:16.84
So don't take off days voluntarily.

834
01:05:16.84 --> 01:05:18.08
Don't do that.

835
01:05:18.08 --> 01:05:22.24
Let the days off come through life.

836
01:05:22.24 --> 01:05:24.16
And then you don't have to freak out about it.

837
01:05:24.16 --> 01:05:25.84
You just go, oh cool, I got a day off day to rest.

838
01:05:25.84 --> 01:05:26.84
Cool.

839
01:05:26.84 --> 01:05:27.84
I'm going to travel.

840
01:05:27.84 --> 01:05:29.16
You know, I'm going to miss a workout today.

841
01:05:29.16 --> 01:05:31.000
I'm just going to take it as a day to rest.

842
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So but I do.

843
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.20
I work out every day.

844
01:05:33.20 --> 01:05:39.52
And part of that is going off instinct of what I feel like of what type of workout

845
01:05:39.52 --> 01:05:41.24
I'm going to do.

846
01:05:41.24 --> 01:05:47.16
And by that, sometimes I mean, I don't feel like doing a certain kind of workout.

847
01:05:47.16 --> 01:05:52.76
Therefore I'm going to do it because it's punishment for being weak.

848
01:05:52.76 --> 01:05:55.48
And then there's some from like, you know what, I do not want to do that kind of workout

849
01:05:55.48 --> 01:05:57.60
today because I feel an impending injury.

850
01:05:57.60 --> 01:05:58.60
Oh yeah.

851
01:05:58.60 --> 01:06:01.20
So like, hey, I'm going to lift real heavy today.

852
01:06:01.20 --> 01:06:02.20
No, not today.

853
01:06:02.20 --> 01:06:03.20
I'm tight.

854
01:06:03.20 --> 01:06:04.20
I'm sore.

855
01:06:04.20 --> 01:06:06.12
I'm going to not do that type of workout today.

856
01:06:06.12 --> 01:06:14.80
So it's a little combination of instinct and discipline versus freedom of, you know, what

857
01:06:14.80 --> 01:06:16.20
this is going to be too much for you today.

858
01:06:16.20 --> 01:06:18.44
I don't want to lift heavy today or I don't feel it.

859
01:06:18.44 --> 01:06:20.88
Sometimes I feel like lifting heavy.

860
01:06:20.88 --> 01:06:23.32
You know, in other words, I'm maybe drained.

861
01:06:23.32 --> 01:06:27.52
I'm drained to do some kind of a endurance type workout or a mat.

862
01:06:27.52 --> 01:06:30.96
So I'm just going to go in there and just just do some singles.

863
01:06:30.96 --> 01:06:34.08
But then some days, you feel, you know, I'm, I don't feel like putting any heavy weight

864
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:35.08
up today.

865
01:06:35.08 --> 01:06:37.80
I'm going to go in there and do something lighter, but maybe higher repetitions and that

866
01:06:37.80 --> 01:06:38.96
type of things.

867
01:06:38.96 --> 01:06:40.96
So I'm doing that every day.

868
01:06:40.96 --> 01:06:42.40
You know, calisthenics.

869
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:44.92
Sometimes I'm doing a combination of all three symptoms and doing one.

870
01:06:44.92 --> 01:06:47.40
So that's just how I'm getting after it.

871
01:06:47.40 --> 01:06:52.64
And again, I think at some point I'm going to write an ebook because the publishing

872
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:55.76
process and the publishing will all be real pain.

873
01:06:55.76 --> 01:06:58.04
And the ebook's not any book.

874
01:06:58.04 --> 01:06:59.04
Any book is easier.

875
01:06:59.04 --> 01:07:00.20
It's easier to do.

876
01:07:00.20 --> 01:07:01.20
You do it.

877
01:07:01.20 --> 01:07:02.20
You produce it.

878
01:07:02.20 --> 01:07:05.48
You just put it through Amazon and Amazon just says, oh cool, you sound like I could

879
01:07:05.48 --> 01:07:06.80
sound for like three bucks.

880
01:07:06.80 --> 01:07:07.80
Oh, dang.

881
01:07:07.80 --> 01:07:10.000
And then anyone can want some could just get it.

882
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And it doesn't have to be.

883
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.88
I don't feel bad if I don't.

884
01:07:12.88 --> 01:07:16.96
You know, if it's not the, it's something that I could do the way I wanted to do.

885
01:07:16.96 --> 01:07:21.08
I don't have to, I don't have to, like, I don't have to make it a certain length.

886
01:07:21.08 --> 01:07:22.08
Oh.

887
01:07:22.08 --> 01:07:23.76
Like, no, it's man, it's three bucks.

888
01:07:23.76 --> 01:07:25.64
You know, it's 28 pages.

889
01:07:25.64 --> 01:07:27.32
That's the information I have.

890
01:07:27.32 --> 01:07:31.48
It's not, you know, if someone said, hey, Jock, we want you to write a fitness book, then

891
01:07:31.48 --> 01:07:33.64
that's going to be 127 pages.

892
01:07:33.64 --> 01:07:37.56
And it's going to have a bunch of things in it that I want to talk about.

893
01:07:37.56 --> 01:07:39.76
Because it's not that complicated.

894
01:07:39.76 --> 01:07:40.76
Right.

895
01:07:40.76 --> 01:07:45.32
So 27 pages ebook downloaded.

896
01:07:45.32 --> 01:07:46.32
Print it out.

897
01:07:46.32 --> 01:07:47.56
Everybody can have it.

898
01:07:47.56 --> 01:07:48.92
Cost three bucks.

899
01:07:48.92 --> 01:07:49.92
People are stoked.

900
01:07:49.92 --> 01:07:51.20
We're all good.

901
01:07:51.20 --> 01:07:54.24
People can stop asking me what my workouts are like.

902
01:07:54.24 --> 01:07:55.24
Because everybody wants to know that.

903
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:59.88
I don't know why I'm not, you know, some incredible athlete, you know.

904
01:07:59.88 --> 01:08:02.48
So here's my workouts.

905
01:08:02.48 --> 01:08:05.32
And so that's what I'm thinking to do.

906
01:08:05.32 --> 01:08:10.12
Then again, that's, that's, I've been thinking about actually getting someone and saying,

907
01:08:10.12 --> 01:08:14.88
hey, you seem like a capable human, help me write a little ebook.

908
01:08:14.88 --> 01:08:17.72
I'm going to tell you what to put in it and you do it.

909
01:08:17.72 --> 01:08:19.32
Why, so it like sounds dope or what?

910
01:08:19.32 --> 01:08:21.40
No, no, no, just so it gets done.

911
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:22.76
Because right now I'm busy.

912
01:08:22.76 --> 01:08:23.76
Right.

913
01:08:23.76 --> 01:08:24.76
So I've got to move that up.

914
01:08:24.76 --> 01:08:25.76
I've got to move that up on my chart.

915
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:30.76
Because I know people want to get out of that.

916
01:08:30.76 --> 01:08:31.76
Okay.

917
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:37.64
So then on top of the work now, there's this surfing, which if there's waves, I'm surfing.

918
01:08:37.64 --> 01:08:38.64
Right.

919
01:08:38.64 --> 01:08:39.64
That's just the way it goes.

920
01:08:39.64 --> 01:08:40.64
If there's good waves, I'm surfing.

921
01:08:40.64 --> 01:08:42.000
There's not always good waves.

922
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.48
But if there's waves, I'm surfing.

923
01:08:43.48 --> 01:08:46.76
One thing I need to do more of is just go out and paddle.

924
01:08:46.76 --> 01:08:47.76
I need to do that.

925
01:08:47.76 --> 01:08:48.76
And we'll just go out.

926
01:08:48.76 --> 01:08:49.76
So you're constantly in shape.

927
01:08:49.76 --> 01:08:52.76
Because paddling a surfboard is a different kind of conditioning for anything else.

928
01:08:52.76 --> 01:08:54.76
Yeah, just to be in shape for paddling.

929
01:08:54.76 --> 01:08:59.44
Kind of like I've been saying, hey, if you want to get good or hump on a rucksack, then

930
01:08:59.44 --> 01:09:00.44
just hump a rucksack.

931
01:09:00.44 --> 01:09:04.28
That if you want to get good at doing poles too well, if you want to be good at paddling a surfboard,

932
01:09:04.28 --> 01:09:05.88
you got to paddle a surfboard.

933
01:09:05.88 --> 01:09:08.72
So you always feel weak when the big waves come in.

934
01:09:08.72 --> 01:09:10.16
You haven't surfed in a while.

935
01:09:10.16 --> 01:09:11.80
And you feel weak because you haven't been paddling.

936
01:09:11.80 --> 01:09:13.60
You've practiced the discipline.

937
01:09:13.60 --> 01:09:16.76
So I should be paddling more.

938
01:09:16.76 --> 01:09:18.88
And then we get to the the jujitsu.

939
01:09:18.88 --> 01:09:19.88
The roll.

940
01:09:19.88 --> 01:09:20.88
The jujitsu.

941
01:09:20.88 --> 01:09:22.72
So I roll if I'm home.

942
01:09:22.72 --> 01:09:25.72
I'm going to the gym and I'm training.

943
01:09:25.72 --> 01:09:29.72
You know, we usually do some technique.

944
01:09:29.72 --> 01:09:35.72
I usually get a little something from Jeff or from Dean.

945
01:09:35.72 --> 01:09:42.72
And you know, Dean and Jeff, the what's crazy is you can always learn something.

946
01:09:42.72 --> 01:09:44.72
It still freaks me out.

947
01:09:44.72 --> 01:09:45.72
Yeah.

948
01:09:45.72 --> 01:09:50.72
Because it's not like when I say learn something, I'm not like saying that they're teaching me some new variation

949
01:09:50.72 --> 01:09:52.72
to the go go plachia.

950
01:09:52.72 --> 01:09:53.72
Right?

951
01:09:53.72 --> 01:09:54.72
Yeah.

952
01:09:54.72 --> 01:09:55.72
No.

953
01:09:55.72 --> 01:10:00.72
They're teaching like Dean will say, hey, when you put the guillotine on over here, make this adjustment.

954
01:10:00.72 --> 01:10:03.72
Or when you're passing the guard, do this here.

955
01:10:03.72 --> 01:10:09.72
Like some simple thing or Jeff or Jeff, whoever was, I said, hey, Jeff, teach my son the

956
01:10:09.72 --> 01:10:11.72
the dars choke.

957
01:10:11.72 --> 01:10:16.72
And I just watched him give my son, you know, like a seven minute class on the dars choke.

958
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:25.72
Now my son, you know, can you imagine you're getting your nine years old and you're getting a personal class on the dars choke from Jeff

959
01:10:25.72 --> 01:10:28.72
color, but my son, you know, he just thinks that's normal.

960
01:10:28.72 --> 01:10:33.72
But I'm watching and I remember Jeff was just going over little details and all.

961
01:10:33.72 --> 01:10:35.72
Stuff that I did not know.

962
01:10:35.72 --> 01:10:37.72
Chuck will relearn in the dars.

963
01:10:37.72 --> 01:10:38.72
Really learning the dars choke.

964
01:10:38.72 --> 01:10:44.72
And so there's always these little things and I always, I'm surprised at the obviousness of those things.

965
01:10:44.72 --> 01:10:47.72
And actually, it does happen occasionally in the other direction.

966
01:10:47.72 --> 01:10:53.72
You know, Dean was going through a slump race really having a hard time passing my guard.

967
01:10:53.72 --> 01:10:59.72
And I just said, hey, man, you've been doing why just do X.

968
01:10:59.72 --> 01:11:04.72
And you could see I saw this face because he has a mutant grappling mind.

969
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:08.72
Like I saw in his face as soon as I told him that it was like being, it was like connection made.

970
01:11:08.72 --> 01:11:11.72
And he instantly started passing my guard again.

971
01:11:11.72 --> 01:11:17.72
I don't understand the damn, but yeah, you get these little obvious things.

972
01:11:17.72 --> 01:11:21.72
You get the, you get the, the learning.

973
01:11:21.72 --> 01:11:26.72
So you always trying to learn a little something and then you know there's the situational drills of going in.

974
01:11:26.72 --> 01:11:29.72
And then there's a thinners the reality.

975
01:11:29.72 --> 01:11:30.72
Here's the reality, man.

976
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:32.72
I like to roll.

977
01:11:32.72 --> 01:11:32.72
Yeah.

978
01:11:32.72 --> 01:11:33.72
I like to roll.

979
01:11:33.72 --> 01:11:35.72
That's the reality of it.

980
01:11:35.72 --> 01:11:37.72
I enjoy training.

981
01:11:37.72 --> 01:11:42.72
Not starting. I'm not starting in one position and going into, no, I like to train.

982
01:11:42.72 --> 01:11:44.72
That's what I like to do. That's what I love about your jitsu.

983
01:11:44.72 --> 01:11:46.72
So I like to roll and I roll.

984
01:11:46.72 --> 01:11:49.72
And whenever I go in, my goal is to roll.

985
01:11:49.72 --> 01:11:54.72
And the same way that I will, some nights I go in like there was,

986
01:11:54.72 --> 01:12:01.72
some days I go in or nights and, and, you know, normal night I just feel like roll and so I go in and roll.

987
01:12:01.72 --> 01:12:05.72
Some days I'm like, you know what, man, I'm not feeling it today.

988
01:12:05.72 --> 01:12:08.72
I'm going to get it on and I'll force myself.

989
01:12:08.72 --> 01:12:13.72
That kind of, that's kind of like when you're kid and you start crying or something and you dad tells you,

990
01:12:13.72 --> 01:12:19.72
I'll give you something to cry about.

991
01:12:19.72 --> 01:12:20.72
Yeah.

992
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:21.72
It's like that.

993
01:12:21.72 --> 01:12:23.72
It's like, oh, you don't feel like it.

994
01:12:23.72 --> 01:12:25.72
I'll give you something to not feel good or whatever.

995
01:12:25.72 --> 01:12:26.72
That's right.

996
01:12:26.72 --> 01:12:27.72
It is that.

997
01:12:27.72 --> 01:12:34.72
And like a couple weeks ago, I said to my, I got there and I did not feel like rolling and I said to myself,

998
01:12:34.72 --> 01:12:37.72
I'm not going to stop until everybody stops.

999
01:12:37.72 --> 01:12:41.72
And so, you know, the last, you know, so we start with 20 guys on the mat and then after three rounds,

1000
01:12:41.72 --> 01:12:50.72
there's, you know, 15 guys or 16 guys on the mat and then it down day 10 and then eight and then four and then it's me and one other guy.

1001
01:12:50.72 --> 01:12:53.72
I'm like, looks like it's you got the last round, my friend.

1002
01:12:53.72 --> 01:12:54.72
But I just did that to myself.

1003
01:12:54.72 --> 01:12:58.72
It's a little form of, it's a little form of exercising a little discipline.

1004
01:12:58.72 --> 01:13:03.72
But that being said, there's days where I go in and I don't feel it and I don't feel as a different sense

1005
01:13:03.72 --> 01:13:06.72
that I have, which is today's not going to be a good day.

1006
01:13:06.72 --> 01:13:08.72
Today I'm going to tweak something today.

1007
01:13:08.72 --> 01:13:11.72
I'm two, I'm two, ward down or whatever.

1008
01:13:11.72 --> 01:13:16.72
And so I'll go, I'll do some rolls and then I'll just, I'll just leave it at that.

1009
01:13:16.72 --> 01:13:19.72
You know, I won't force myself to stay on the mat forever.

1010
01:13:19.72 --> 01:13:28.72
So I do again, I use that instinct of of what I am feeling to make a decision on how it's going to go down.

1011
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:37.72
Just went one day, Greg, he randomly came in and he was like, yeah, I feel like I just feel like I'm going to break my toe today.

1012
01:13:37.72 --> 01:13:39.72
Yeah, sounds weird right? He said that.

1013
01:13:39.72 --> 01:13:40.72
Yeah.

1014
01:13:40.72 --> 01:13:44.72
I feel like, and I was like, oh yeah, you just feel that? He was like, yeah, I just feel like it.

1015
01:13:44.72 --> 01:13:48.72
That day, I broke my toe.

1016
01:13:48.72 --> 01:13:54.72
I never really break it. It was like kind of touching it or something like that, but it's with us weird right?

1017
01:13:54.72 --> 01:13:57.72
I know, way different point, but still.

1018
01:13:57.72 --> 01:14:07.72
So my workout's all go through it real fast, different than yours, I work out average five days a week, but.

1019
01:14:07.72 --> 01:14:10.72
They're not everything all in one.

1020
01:14:10.72 --> 01:14:17.72
So if I roll three days, I'll lift and do mat content cardio and that kind of stuff two days.

1021
01:14:17.72 --> 01:14:22.72
Really? Yeah. So I don't do like, what do you do with all your free time, man?

1022
01:14:22.72 --> 01:14:23.72
Make videos.

1023
01:14:23.72 --> 01:14:25.72
Right, right.

1024
01:14:25.72 --> 01:14:27.72
Hang with the BAM.

1025
01:14:27.72 --> 01:14:29.72
So you really, how many times a week do you train?

1026
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:30.72
Three.

1027
01:14:30.72 --> 01:14:31.72
Two jits here.

1028
01:14:31.72 --> 01:14:32.72
Three sometimes too.

1029
01:14:32.72 --> 01:14:35.72
Unless I'm like super busy then one.

1030
01:14:35.72 --> 01:14:36.72
Yeah.

1031
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:38.72
But yeah, back when I was competing, I was doing six.

1032
01:14:38.72 --> 01:14:39.72
Yeah.

1033
01:14:39.72 --> 01:14:43.72
And now it's like two days, not two days train, but I'll do running lifting conditioning.

1034
01:14:43.72 --> 01:14:44.72
Yeah.

1035
01:14:44.72 --> 01:14:46.72
And then a different session.

1036
01:14:46.72 --> 01:14:49.72
I do jits in whatever, you know, that entails.

1037
01:14:49.72 --> 01:14:50.72
Same thing as you.

1038
01:14:50.72 --> 01:14:53.72
You know, do some technique, but I'll typically.

1039
01:14:53.72 --> 01:14:56.72
Hey, how many rounds do you think like on a typical day?

1040
01:14:56.72 --> 01:15:00.72
You know how you'll do some technique, a little class or training session, even.

1041
01:15:00.72 --> 01:15:01.72
You'll do some technique.

1042
01:15:01.72 --> 01:15:05.72
Maybe some drills six and then rounds, right?

1043
01:15:05.72 --> 01:15:06.72
So you do six rounds.

1044
01:15:06.72 --> 01:15:07.72
That's solid.

1045
01:15:07.72 --> 01:15:07.72
What?

1046
01:15:07.72 --> 01:15:08.72
Five minutes.

1047
01:15:08.72 --> 01:15:10.72
Six or six, six minute rounds.

1048
01:15:10.72 --> 01:15:11.72
Yeah.

1049
01:15:11.72 --> 01:15:11.72
It's kind of like what I thought.

1050
01:15:11.72 --> 01:15:16.72
It's, yeah, it's strange because at one time we did like, we had the gym was closed,

1051
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:18.72
but we had, you know, an open mat.

1052
01:15:18.72 --> 01:15:19.72
But it wasn't an open mat.

1053
01:15:19.72 --> 01:15:20.72
It was like, hey, we're going to train.

1054
01:15:20.72 --> 01:15:21.72
Yeah.

1055
01:15:21.72 --> 01:15:22.72
And we did wait, we who just a bunch of.

1056
01:15:22.72 --> 01:15:23.72
You were probably there.

1057
01:15:23.72 --> 01:15:24.72
I don't know.

1058
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:25.72
I don't remember.

1059
01:15:25.72 --> 01:15:26.72
But we did.

1060
01:15:26.72 --> 01:15:27.72
Six.

1061
01:15:27.72 --> 01:15:28.72
Six minute rounds.

1062
01:15:28.72 --> 01:15:29.72
No, ghee.

1063
01:15:29.72 --> 01:15:31.72
And then six, six minute rounds.

1064
01:15:31.72 --> 01:15:32.72
We do that.

1065
01:15:32.72 --> 01:15:33.72
Yeah.

1066
01:15:33.72 --> 01:15:34.72
I usually don't get tired.

1067
01:15:34.72 --> 01:15:35.72
Yeah.

1068
01:15:35.72 --> 01:15:36.72
I got tired that day.

1069
01:15:36.72 --> 01:15:37.72
Yeah.

1070
01:15:37.72 --> 01:15:38.72
Yeah.

1071
01:15:38.72 --> 01:15:39.72
I got tired that day.

1072
01:15:39.72 --> 01:15:40.72
Yeah.

1073
01:15:40.72 --> 01:15:41.72
How's it?

1074
01:15:41.72 --> 01:15:42.72
Okay.

1075
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:44.72
So I, I'd go to, I haven't been to autism.

1076
01:15:44.72 --> 01:15:46.72
No, no, a few months now.

1077
01:15:46.72 --> 01:15:47.72
But I'd go there.

1078
01:15:47.72 --> 01:15:51.72
Like, when they're trained for ADCC and, and I'd go there once a week.

1079
01:15:51.72 --> 01:15:53.72
Once a week, once every two weeks, just for one.

1080
01:15:53.72 --> 01:15:58.72
And so they do stuff like in every single time I've been there.

1081
01:15:58.72 --> 01:16:00.72
It's been one of these things.

1082
01:16:00.72 --> 01:16:05.72
Ten, uh, six, 10s, six rounds of 10 minutes each.

1083
01:16:05.72 --> 01:16:09.72
Um, 30 seconds in between one and then one minute between the next one.

1084
01:16:09.72 --> 01:16:15.72
You know, it goes to, or five, ten minute rounds.

1085
01:16:15.72 --> 01:16:17.72
You know, four, ten minute, or minute rounds.

1086
01:16:17.72 --> 01:16:20.72
And then one, twenty minute rounds.

1087
01:16:20.72 --> 01:16:21.72
Those, you get tired.

1088
01:16:21.72 --> 01:16:22.72
Yeah.

1089
01:16:22.72 --> 01:16:27.72
I have a conditioning because what, when we do 20, like when I'm, when Dean's getting ready for

1090
01:16:27.72 --> 01:16:31.72
ACC or whoever we got, that's doing the longer or the no time limit matches.

1091
01:16:31.72 --> 01:16:32.72
Yeah.

1092
01:16:32.72 --> 01:16:35.72
And I'm doing 20 minutes, 20 minute rounds.

1093
01:16:35.72 --> 01:16:36.72
I'm just good to go in.

1094
01:16:36.72 --> 01:16:37.72
Yeah.

1095
01:16:37.72 --> 01:16:38.72
I don't know why.

1096
01:16:38.72 --> 01:16:39.72
I don't know why.

1097
01:16:39.72 --> 01:16:40.72
I don't know why.

1098
01:16:40.72 --> 01:16:44.72
But I think it has to do with what we talked about the other day, where I'm not a really fast

1099
01:16:44.72 --> 01:16:45.72
Sprinter.

1100
01:16:45.72 --> 01:16:46.72
Right.

1101
01:16:46.72 --> 01:16:47.72
And I'm not a really fast runner.

1102
01:16:47.72 --> 01:16:49.72
But if you're going to rucksack on me, I can go for a long time.

1103
01:16:49.72 --> 01:16:50.72
Yeah.

1104
01:16:50.72 --> 01:16:51.72
And I think it's one of those.

1105
01:16:51.72 --> 01:16:52.72
Like I can grapple for a long time.

1106
01:16:52.72 --> 01:16:53.72
Yeah.

1107
01:16:53.72 --> 01:16:54.72
Not get tired.

1108
01:16:54.72 --> 01:16:55.72
Yeah.

1109
01:16:55.72 --> 01:17:00.72
I think mine's like, psychological where, if I know it's 20 minutes, then I'm not, I don't feel like,

1110
01:17:00.72 --> 01:17:04.72
I don't know, confined or, I don't know, I feel like, I feel like, I don't know.

1111
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:07.72
But the hardest thing that we do is, like, when we shark tank each other.

1112
01:17:07.72 --> 01:17:10.72
You know, is when you're put in, you know, I'll be, or one of our guys that's competing.

1113
01:17:10.72 --> 01:17:15.72
We'll go in the middle and you're getting a fresh guy every, two minutes, one minute, three minutes, five minutes.

1114
01:17:15.72 --> 01:17:18.72
Whatever the case may be, you're getting somebody fresh on you.

1115
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:20.72
And that's where you get, that's where you get tested.

1116
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:21.72
Yeah.

1117
01:17:21.72 --> 01:17:28.72
It's, I would say a typical class, it's like anywhere from a five minute round, six minute round.

1118
01:17:28.72 --> 01:17:31.72
Either five or six minutes, three, four or four rounds.

1119
01:17:31.72 --> 01:17:37.72
I'd say that's a typical, you know, not a training for competition, just, you know, this is what we're doing.

1120
01:17:37.72 --> 01:17:41.72
If you go four, five, six rounds, that's like, that's kind of a lot around.

1121
01:17:41.72 --> 01:17:45.72
Compared to just the average, I think it might experience.

1122
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:46.72
Yeah.

1123
01:17:46.72 --> 01:17:50.72
I sort, I feel like I got, I got good training yet, like, six, six, better rounds.

1124
01:17:50.72 --> 01:17:51.72
That's where I feel good.

1125
01:17:51.72 --> 01:17:52.72
Yeah, that's 36.

1126
01:17:52.72 --> 01:17:53.72
Yeah.

1127
01:17:53.72 --> 01:17:55.72
It's almost 40, 40 something minutes of training.

1128
01:17:55.72 --> 01:17:56.72
That makes me feel good.

1129
01:17:56.72 --> 01:17:58.72
Yeah, that's a lot, that's a lot, though.

1130
01:17:58.72 --> 01:18:01.72
You'll see guys dropping off after three rounds out, say.

1131
01:18:01.72 --> 01:18:02.72
Yeah.

1132
01:18:02.72 --> 01:18:03.72
Not everybody's going to be a son.

1133
01:18:03.72 --> 01:18:04.72
Yeah, has to do with who you're training with.

1134
01:18:04.72 --> 01:18:05.72
Yes, yeah.

1135
01:18:05.72 --> 01:18:08.72
Because I mean, I can train with somebody that's not that good all day long.

1136
01:18:08.72 --> 01:18:09.72
Right.

1137
01:18:09.72 --> 01:18:12.72
But you can start getting the grinders on you.

1138
01:18:12.72 --> 01:18:13.72
Yeah.

1139
01:18:13.72 --> 01:18:16.72
Yeah.

1140
01:18:16.72 --> 01:18:17.72
Yeah.

1141
01:18:17.72 --> 01:18:18.72
Yeah.

1142
01:18:18.72 --> 01:18:23.72
One round is like literally like three rounds with an average normal person on your level.

1143
01:18:23.72 --> 01:18:23.72
Yeah.

1144
01:18:23.72 --> 01:18:25.72
And this is first pace in the strength.

1145
01:18:25.72 --> 01:18:31.72
What's cool about Andy was Andy is he's probably my main training partner now.

1146
01:18:31.72 --> 01:18:32.72
Got you.

1147
01:18:32.72 --> 01:18:33.72
Yeah.

1148
01:18:33.72 --> 01:18:34.72
Got you all the time.

1149
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:36.72
But for a while, he didn't work out at all.

1150
01:18:36.72 --> 01:18:37.72
He didn't like lift her.

1151
01:18:37.72 --> 01:18:38.72
Right.

1152
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:38.72
Yeah.

1153
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:39.72
Back in the day.

1154
01:18:39.72 --> 01:18:41.72
And then I said, hey, man, you got to get to the next level.

1155
01:18:41.72 --> 01:18:43.72
I hate to say, you got to do some work now.

1156
01:18:43.72 --> 01:18:44.72
And he's an athletic guy.

1157
01:18:44.72 --> 01:18:45.72
Yes.

1158
01:18:45.72 --> 01:18:47.72
And I just said, hey, go do a bunch of pull ups.

1159
01:18:47.72 --> 01:18:49.72
And then next they do a bunch of push ups and dips.

1160
01:18:49.72 --> 01:18:51.72
And then next they do some squats.

1161
01:18:51.72 --> 01:18:53.72
And he's okay.

1162
01:18:53.72 --> 01:18:55.72
He started doing it in a month, man.

1163
01:18:55.72 --> 01:18:56.72
He was a different dude.

1164
01:18:56.72 --> 01:18:57.72
Yeah.

1165
01:18:57.72 --> 01:18:58.72
And now we started powerlifting.

1166
01:18:58.72 --> 01:19:00.72
So he's even more,

1167
01:19:00.72 --> 01:19:01.72
a little bit more.

1168
01:19:01.72 --> 01:19:02.72
But he's wants some big,

1169
01:19:02.72 --> 01:19:03.72
these want some big tournaments.

1170
01:19:03.72 --> 01:19:04.72
Yeah.

1171
01:19:04.72 --> 01:19:05.72
Got some game for sure.

1172
01:19:05.72 --> 01:19:06.72
He did good in the challenges league.

1173
01:19:06.72 --> 01:19:07.72
Metamons challenge.

1174
01:19:07.72 --> 01:19:08.72
Yeah.

1175
01:19:08.72 --> 01:19:09.72
I think he took second.

1176
01:19:09.72 --> 01:19:10.72
Yeah.

1177
01:19:10.72 --> 01:19:11.72
He's great.

1178
01:19:11.72 --> 01:19:12.72
Yeah.

1179
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:12.72
Yes.

1180
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:15.72
Funny he was, I noticed that where he was always athletic and stuff.

1181
01:19:15.72 --> 01:19:18.72
And then one time I ain't seen him for not that long.

1182
01:19:18.72 --> 01:19:20.72
But he was like, for we didn't take him long.

1183
01:19:20.72 --> 01:19:22.72
I was like, hey, what, you know, what did you do?

1184
01:19:22.72 --> 01:19:23.72
Because you look way different right now.

1185
01:19:23.72 --> 01:19:26.72
And he was like, oh, I just changed my eating.

1186
01:19:26.72 --> 01:19:29.72
I don't eat like whole containers of Nutella.

1187
01:19:29.72 --> 01:19:30.72
Anymore.

1188
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:31.72
Okay.

1189
01:19:31.72 --> 01:19:32.72
Yeah.

1190
01:19:32.72 --> 01:19:33.72
Yeah.

1191
01:19:33.72 --> 01:19:34.72
Yeah.

1192
01:19:34.72 --> 01:19:35.72
I think that's it.

1193
01:19:35.72 --> 01:19:36.72
Yeah.

1194
01:19:36.72 --> 01:19:37.72
That's it.

1195
01:19:37.72 --> 01:19:38.72
Next question.

1196
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:39.72
Let's do it.

1197
01:19:39.72 --> 01:19:46.72
Can you please share on your podcast what the difference between lazy delegation and decentralization

1198
01:19:46.72 --> 01:19:47.72
is.

1199
01:19:47.72 --> 01:19:48.72
Okay.

1200
01:19:48.72 --> 01:19:54.72
So decentralized command is obviously the, uh, one of the principles combat we have in the book that

1201
01:19:54.72 --> 01:19:57.72
we wrote.

1202
01:19:57.72 --> 01:20:01.72
And I have a very simple definition that I've been explaining to people decentralized command.

1203
01:20:01.72 --> 01:20:03.72
It's everybody leads.

1204
01:20:03.72 --> 01:20:06.72
That's what decentralized command is.

1205
01:20:06.72 --> 01:20:10.72
And obviously that means you want everybody else to.

1206
01:20:10.72 --> 01:20:12.72
Lead.

1207
01:20:12.72 --> 01:20:16.72
And so this question is what's different between the lazy and just delegating everything.

1208
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:19.72
And what's good decentralization.

1209
01:20:19.72 --> 01:20:22.72
So lazy delegation.

1210
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:25.72
Number one is delegating things that are actually your job.

1211
01:20:25.72 --> 01:20:26.72
Right?

1212
01:20:26.72 --> 01:20:29.72
Because there's there's some roles and responsibilities that people have.

1213
01:20:29.72 --> 01:20:32.72
And if you take something that is supposed to be your job.

1214
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:37.72
Right.

1215
01:20:37.72 --> 01:20:40.72
And you delegated somebody else because you don't feel like doing it.

1216
01:20:40.72 --> 01:20:42.72
Then that's lazy.

1217
01:20:42.72 --> 01:20:46.72
If, as a matter of fact, if you're delegating something that.

1218
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:52.72
It's something that you're delegating because you don't want to do it.

1219
01:20:52.72 --> 01:20:53.72
Then.

1220
01:20:53.72 --> 01:20:54.72
Then that's being lazy.

1221
01:20:54.72 --> 01:20:55.72
Right?

1222
01:20:55.72 --> 01:20:57.72
If you're actually delegating something because it's something you don't want to do.

1223
01:20:57.72 --> 01:20:58.72
Right.

1224
01:20:58.72 --> 01:21:01.72
Then you're being lazy.

1225
01:21:01.72 --> 01:21:05.72
And I'll tell you it's actually a mindset.

1226
01:21:05.72 --> 01:21:07.72
To.

1227
01:21:07.72 --> 01:21:13.72
Take on the tasks of the things that you don't want to do or that your team doesn't want to do.

1228
01:21:13.72 --> 01:21:15.72
So this is.

1229
01:21:15.72 --> 01:21:17.72
Let like literally do.

1230
01:21:17.72 --> 01:21:21.72
There's there's something that is hard to do or that no one wants to do.

1231
01:21:21.72 --> 01:21:22.72
Do that thing.

1232
01:21:22.72 --> 01:21:23.72
And I give you an example.

1233
01:21:23.72 --> 01:21:27.72
We had to we had to stand watch in Iraq on my first deployment to Iraq.

1234
01:21:27.72 --> 01:21:30.72
We had to stand watch on the prisoners that we would capture.

1235
01:21:30.72 --> 01:21:31.72
So we come back.

1236
01:21:31.72 --> 01:21:32.72
We have to stand watch on them.

1237
01:21:32.72 --> 01:21:33.72
So.

1238
01:21:33.72 --> 01:21:36.72
I made myself and my assistant, Patoon Command.

1239
01:21:36.72 --> 01:21:38.72
I also put some command at the time.

1240
01:21:38.72 --> 01:21:39.72
I gave us.

1241
01:21:39.72 --> 01:21:46.72
I assigned us the worst watch of the night like the zero 300 in the morning till zero 500 in the morning.

1242
01:21:46.72 --> 01:21:49.72
The watch that nobody wants because it's in the middle of your sleep pattern.

1243
01:21:49.72 --> 01:21:51.72
No one wanted that watch.

1244
01:21:51.72 --> 01:21:52.72
I put us on that watch.

1245
01:21:52.72 --> 01:21:54.72
We took the worst watch.

1246
01:21:54.72 --> 01:21:56.72
So I didn't delegate the hard watch.

1247
01:21:56.72 --> 01:21:58.72
I took the hard watch.

1248
01:21:58.72 --> 01:22:01.72
So there's an example of the opposite of being lazy.

1249
01:22:01.72 --> 01:22:04.72
You're taking on board the hard tasks.

1250
01:22:04.72 --> 01:22:09.72
Another one is when we would go shooting and we'd get done shooting in a balloon.

1251
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:10.72
You're not even the seal team.

1252
01:22:10.72 --> 01:22:11.72
You got to go pick up brass.

1253
01:22:11.72 --> 01:22:16.72
You got to go pick up brass off the ground all over the desert all over the field all over wherever you did a bunch of shooting.

1254
01:22:16.72 --> 01:22:22.72
And it's pretty easy for the guy that's in charge to have a meeting to attend to when I found a pickup brass.

1255
01:22:22.72 --> 01:22:24.72
But I would always pick up brass.

1256
01:22:24.72 --> 01:22:25.72
You know, I would be the L.A.

1257
01:22:25.72 --> 01:22:26.72
The shell.

1258
01:22:26.72 --> 01:22:27.72
The shell cases.

1259
01:22:27.72 --> 01:22:28.72
It's a pain.

1260
01:22:28.72 --> 01:22:33.72
You know, literally, when you're at land warfare, it takes a couple days to pick up brass.

1261
01:22:33.72 --> 01:22:41.72
And instead of like I said, instead of having to go back for a meeting, I'd go out there and jump in there and have the crap job.

1262
01:22:41.72 --> 01:22:43.72
Everybody else have picked up brass.

1263
01:22:43.72 --> 01:22:44.72
So I wouldn't delegate these things.

1264
01:22:44.72 --> 01:22:47.72
That's being lazy when you delegate that.

1265
01:22:47.72 --> 01:22:56.72
And another thing I'll find is if somebody's complaining if one of my subordinates is complaining to me about having to do something.

1266
01:22:56.72 --> 01:22:58.72
I automatically take it.

1267
01:22:58.72 --> 01:23:01.72
And I say, oh, echo, it's a pain for you to do this.

1268
01:23:01.72 --> 01:23:02.72
Cool.

1269
01:23:02.72 --> 01:23:03.72
What I'll do it.

1270
01:23:03.72 --> 01:23:07.72
And it has a good psychological effect.

1271
01:23:07.72 --> 01:23:08.72
Right?

1272
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:13.72
I mean, it's it's it's showing them that like, look man, I'm here for you.

1273
01:23:13.72 --> 01:23:15.72
And if it's too much for you, I'll take it.

1274
01:23:15.72 --> 01:23:20.72
And I've had people literally go, no, no, I got it.

1275
01:23:20.72 --> 01:23:23.72
Because that's the instinct that people have to go look man, I got it.

1276
01:23:23.72 --> 01:23:27.72
And that's what I would do if I complained about something.

1277
01:23:27.72 --> 01:23:30.72
And then I said, and then my boss said to me, you know what, it's too much for you.

1278
01:23:30.72 --> 01:23:31.72
I'll take care of it.

1279
01:23:31.72 --> 01:23:34.72
You're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1280
01:23:34.72 --> 01:23:38.72
So, and that's also, I'll tell you there's also a little form of discipline in there.

1281
01:23:38.72 --> 01:23:43.72
A little form of discipline of taking on board tasks and doing things that you know you don't want to do.

1282
01:23:43.72 --> 01:23:50.72
Yeah, that's a way of exercising some discipline in your life and making things happen.

1283
01:23:50.72 --> 01:23:54.72
So that's the kind of thing, all those things that that's like lazy delegation.

1284
01:23:54.72 --> 01:24:02.72
If you're doing those kind of things where you're getting rid of jobs, you don't want your getting rid of jobs that you should be doing.

1285
01:24:02.72 --> 01:24:11.72
And getting rid of jobs that are a pain or are monotonous or you think they're below you.

1286
01:24:11.72 --> 01:24:16.72
So the opposite that is decentralized command, right?

1287
01:24:16.72 --> 01:24:23.72
So you're letting other people do what they're supposed to do. It's when you're letting people do things that will help them grow.

1288
01:24:23.72 --> 01:24:26.72
Does it help a person grow by picking up brass?

1289
01:24:26.72 --> 01:24:29.72
I suppose there's a little character building in there, but it's not going to literally help them grow.

1290
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:31.72
So you don't need to delegate that task.

1291
01:24:31.72 --> 01:24:36.72
Does it help someone grow as a leader to do the 0 300 to 0 500 watch on prisoners?

1292
01:24:36.72 --> 01:24:41.72
No, it's pain. It's just unmitigated pain.

1293
01:24:41.72 --> 01:24:46.72
So it doesn't help people grow so that then you don't have to decentralize that.

1294
01:24:46.72 --> 01:24:50.72
But if you got something that's going to let somebody grow, you let them do it.

1295
01:24:50.72 --> 01:24:59.72
If there's something that allows you to stand back and be the tactical genius and we wrote about this in the book, you know?

1296
01:24:59.72 --> 01:25:06.72
Then, and thereby allowing me to have a different perspective on something,

1297
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:09.72
then I should absolutely decentralize that and delegate.

1298
01:25:09.72 --> 01:25:13.72
So if there was a mission came up and we need to come up with a plan, I would tell you to plan it.

1299
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:15.72
I'd be like, echo, you come up with a plan on this.

1300
01:25:15.72 --> 01:25:20.72
And then you'd go and plan it and you'd be all involved in it and you'd lose the elevation that I would have.

1301
01:25:20.72 --> 01:25:23.72
So when I come back to look at your plan, you say, here's the plan.

1302
01:25:23.72 --> 01:25:27.72
I go, hey, it looks good except for these two points and you'd be like, man, how did he see those points?

1303
01:25:27.72 --> 01:25:29.72
I'd say it's because I had the altitude.

1304
01:25:29.72 --> 01:25:33.72
So that's another time that decentralized command.

1305
01:25:33.72 --> 01:25:38.72
It's a very helpful decentralized command means letting people make little mistakes.

1306
01:25:38.72 --> 01:25:41.72
And not punishing them because of those mistakes.

1307
01:25:41.72 --> 01:25:44.72
That's decentralized command.

1308
01:25:44.72 --> 01:25:52.72
If I just hammer people and punish them when they make a mistake, they're not going to want to take any chance.

1309
01:25:52.72 --> 01:25:55.72
They're not going to want to take any risk and they're not going to want to lead.

1310
01:25:55.72 --> 01:25:58.72
Because I've been punitive with my actions towards them.

1311
01:25:58.72 --> 01:26:02.72
Now, that doesn't mean, and I've seen this happen.

1312
01:26:02.72 --> 01:26:05.72
That doesn't mean if I'm going to let you go plan a mission and I see you're screwing up.

1313
01:26:05.72 --> 01:26:09.72
I'm just going to let you have a catastrophic failure.

1314
01:26:09.72 --> 01:26:12.72
No, I'm going to be like, hey, echo. Think about this over here.

1315
01:26:12.72 --> 01:26:14.72
Hey, echo. Think about that over there. We're going to get you dialed in.

1316
01:26:14.72 --> 01:26:18.72
I'm going to give you some rope, but I'm not going to let you hang yourself.

1317
01:26:18.72 --> 01:26:23.72
I'm actually going to give you enough rope to get the job done and think on your own.

1318
01:26:23.72 --> 01:26:28.72
But if you start looking like you're going to hang yourself, I'm going to stop you.

1319
01:26:28.72 --> 01:26:31.72
The other thing about decentralized command, that's positive.

1320
01:26:31.72 --> 01:26:41.72
That's not just lazy delegation is when you let your subordinates lead so that you can focus upward, outward, and forward.

1321
01:26:41.72 --> 01:26:48.72
So if you have a mission, if we have a mission to accomplish, and I tell you to lead it, that means you can take care of that mission.

1322
01:26:48.72 --> 01:26:55.72
I can look upward, meaning up the chain of command, find out what's going on, outward, meaning what's the enemy doing, and forward,

1323
01:26:55.72 --> 01:26:57.72
meaning what's going to happen in the future.

1324
01:26:57.72 --> 01:27:05.72
And if I'm wrapped up in the accomplishing of the task at hand from a leadership position, I can't do any of those things.

1325
01:27:05.72 --> 01:27:09.72
I can't look, I can't look, I can't look forward, I can't look forward.

1326
01:27:09.72 --> 01:27:20.72
You got to let people lead so that they can become leaders, and your actual goal, and this is what people get intimidated, is to set them up so they can take your job.

1327
01:27:20.72 --> 01:27:26.72
That's what you want. You want them to be able to take your job, and people get scared of that, but you can't be scared of that.

1328
01:27:26.72 --> 01:27:31.72
Yeah, well, there's a quote where one guy was asking the other guy or something,

1329
01:27:31.72 --> 01:27:38.72
like, hey, what happens if we develop our workers, and then they leave us, and he's like, it's better than not developing on.

1330
01:27:38.72 --> 01:27:40.72
We have, and have it on stay.

1331
01:27:40.72 --> 01:27:42.72
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

1332
01:27:42.72 --> 01:27:47.72
I mean, that's me, you were arguing a quote, but I'm saying that.

1333
01:27:47.72 --> 01:27:51.72
Yeah, no, that's good, and you definitely want to set your people up.

1334
01:27:51.72 --> 01:27:53.72
You want to work yourself out of a job.

1335
01:27:53.72 --> 01:27:58.72
And then you've got to, you're other opportunities will come because people will see that you develop a team,

1336
01:27:58.72 --> 01:28:07.72
people will see that you develop good leaders, and they're going to say, hey, I want you to come and do that at this higher position, and you're going to get benefit from that as well.

1337
01:28:07.72 --> 01:28:11.72
Eccled, can you ask Jocco to talk more about the writing process?

1338
01:28:11.72 --> 01:28:19.72
Any ups and downs, obstacles, daily rituals, and or future plans?

1339
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:23.72
So I know I've asked, answered this question before.

1340
01:28:23.72 --> 01:28:27.72
It's very, all I answered again, I'm going to do it quickly.

1341
01:28:27.72 --> 01:28:30.72
What were my, what did I do when writing?

1342
01:28:30.72 --> 01:28:33.72
I wrote a thousand words a day, no matter what.

1343
01:28:33.72 --> 01:28:38.72
If I had some obstacles, as the question hit said here, I would write.

1344
01:28:38.72 --> 01:28:40.72
If I had ups and downs, I would write.

1345
01:28:40.72 --> 01:28:42.72
If I had a daily ritual, it was to write.

1346
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:44.72
Every day, that's what I did.

1347
01:28:44.72 --> 01:28:46.72
I wrote a thousand words a day.

1348
01:28:46.72 --> 01:28:54.72
And when you're writing a 50,000 or 60,000 word manuscript, that means in two months, you've got your manuscript done.

1349
01:28:54.72 --> 01:29:03.72
The thing about writing every day, and I've said this before, is if you write every day, you don't need to rehash what you wrote before.

1350
01:29:03.72 --> 01:29:04.72
Because you remember it.

1351
01:29:04.72 --> 01:29:09.72
So you can just open the book or you can open your page, you can open the document, then you can just start writing.

1352
01:29:09.72 --> 01:29:14.72
And even I used to like kind of lead my leave myself a lead sentence that I knew would just,

1353
01:29:14.72 --> 01:29:17.72
I could just sit down the next day and start flowing right into it.

1354
01:29:17.72 --> 01:29:18.72
So do that.

1355
01:29:18.72 --> 01:29:24.72
And also, I had the outline, I mean for extreme ownership that late for my wrote, I had the outline.

1356
01:29:24.72 --> 01:29:25.72
We had the chapters.

1357
01:29:25.72 --> 01:29:28.72
So I brought the new one I was writing about.

1358
01:29:28.72 --> 01:29:31.72
And then it's just a matter of sitting down and making it happen.

1359
01:29:31.72 --> 01:29:33.72
And when I went to college, I was an English major in college.

1360
01:29:33.72 --> 01:29:34.72
And guess what?

1361
01:29:34.72 --> 01:29:43.72
I sat down and wrote when I had to write papers, when I had to write scripts, when I had to write, whatever I had to write, I just sat down and started writing.

1362
01:29:43.72 --> 01:29:47.72
And then it's the same thing when I was in the Navy, the Navy, right? All kinds of stuff.

1363
01:29:47.72 --> 01:29:54.72
You write evaluations, you write operational summaries, you write awards, you write all kinds of things in the Navy.

1364
01:29:54.72 --> 01:29:58.72
And I used to just sit down and write, that's what you've got to do.

1365
01:29:58.72 --> 01:29:59.72
You just got to get on it.

1366
01:29:59.72 --> 01:30:04.72
And one thing about me is my rough draft, when I'm sitting down, I just start writing.

1367
01:30:04.72 --> 01:30:08.72
I know it's going to be rough.

1368
01:30:08.72 --> 01:30:10.72
It's going to be a rough rough draft.

1369
01:30:10.72 --> 01:30:11.72
That's what I'm going to write.

1370
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:13.72
You just go.

1371
01:30:13.72 --> 01:30:14.72
Just go.

1372
01:30:14.72 --> 01:30:15.72
And I don't care.

1373
01:30:15.72 --> 01:30:17.72
And I miss spelling stuff and the punctuation's bad.

1374
01:30:17.72 --> 01:30:19.72
But I don't care about that.

1375
01:30:19.72 --> 01:30:20.72
I'm going to get a stop.

1376
01:30:20.72 --> 01:30:22.72
Because it's so easy to clean that stuff up later.

1377
01:30:22.72 --> 01:30:27.72
The hard part is getting the foundational information down on the paper.

1378
01:30:27.72 --> 01:30:29.72
That's the hard part.

1379
01:30:29.72 --> 01:30:34.72
And it's easy for me to get it at or hone it later.

1380
01:30:34.72 --> 01:30:38.72
Now, as far as future plans, future books.

1381
01:30:38.72 --> 01:30:44.72
Yeah, I mean, life and I are definitely doing a follow up book about leadership.

1382
01:30:44.72 --> 01:30:48.72
And we're working on that right now.

1383
01:30:48.72 --> 01:30:50.72
So that's a common thing.

1384
01:30:50.72 --> 01:30:56.72
I noticed that your text messages are always grammatically correct.

1385
01:30:56.72 --> 01:31:00.72
Yeah, I was an English major.

1386
01:31:00.72 --> 01:31:01.72
And I took classes.

1387
01:31:01.72 --> 01:31:06.72
I took classes like advanced grammar and syntax.

1388
01:31:06.72 --> 01:31:08.72
Yeah.

1389
01:31:08.72 --> 01:31:09.72
And yeah.

1390
01:31:09.72 --> 01:31:16.72
So I actually, I find language and linguistics to be very interesting.

1391
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:17.72
Yeah.

1392
01:31:17.72 --> 01:31:20.72
And I know that might strike some people as weird.

1393
01:31:20.72 --> 01:31:21.72
But I really do.

1394
01:31:21.72 --> 01:31:30.72
I find linguistics and language and the written word and the way words are combined together to make thoughts in people's brains.

1395
01:31:30.72 --> 01:31:32.72
It's a very interesting process to me.

1396
01:31:32.72 --> 01:31:36.72
And so I was very interested in it.

1397
01:31:36.72 --> 01:31:41.72
And that's another reason why I studied English when I was in college.

1398
01:31:41.72 --> 01:31:44.72
It's the written word.

1399
01:31:44.72 --> 01:31:45.72
Yeah.

1400
01:31:45.72 --> 01:31:54.72
You know, it's the written word, which is a very, very powerful, very, very powerful tool.

1401
01:31:54.72 --> 01:31:59.72
I also noticed your overuse of capital letters.

1402
01:31:59.72 --> 01:32:03.72
And text messages, but maybe that's just how you're feeling sometimes.

1403
01:32:03.72 --> 01:32:09.72
That's only when I'm texting you certain things.

1404
01:32:09.72 --> 01:32:11.72
Hmm.

1405
01:32:11.72 --> 01:32:12.72
Next question.

1406
01:32:12.72 --> 01:32:15.72
Like I'll see you on the map.

1407
01:32:15.72 --> 01:32:20.72
Next question.

1408
01:32:20.72 --> 01:32:30.72
Do I have to say something in real time or is it before or after any event?

1409
01:32:30.72 --> 01:32:32.72
I think I've heard you describe both.

1410
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:36.72
Is it both?

1411
01:32:36.72 --> 01:32:37.72
No, it is not both.

1412
01:32:37.72 --> 01:32:38.72
It is not both.

1413
01:32:38.72 --> 01:32:43.72
Actually, and if you think about it, okay, the detachment that we're talking about is when you get involved in these situations,

1414
01:32:43.72 --> 01:32:46.72
you got to attach yourself from so that you can make good decisions that you can see things clearly.

1415
01:32:46.72 --> 01:32:51.72
So that you can assess things clearly.

1416
01:32:51.72 --> 01:32:54.72
That's why you detach from these situations.

1417
01:32:54.72 --> 01:33:00.72
So technically, if before or after an event, you are detached from them because they're not happening at that time.

1418
01:33:00.72 --> 01:33:09.72
Now, I guess you could be so emotional about an event that even after it happens, you could still not see it clearly because you can't detach from it.

1419
01:33:09.72 --> 01:33:12.72
So I guess I could give it to you that, okay.

1420
01:33:12.72 --> 01:33:17.72
And before it, you could be so amped up about it and so nervous about it.

1421
01:33:17.72 --> 01:33:21.72
And so emotional about it that I guess beforehand, you could.

1422
01:33:21.72 --> 01:33:23.72
So I guess I am wrong.

1423
01:33:23.72 --> 01:33:27.72
I am talking about detaching throughout the process.

1424
01:33:27.72 --> 01:33:34.72
Right, but even if you're if you have to detach beforehand, you're not detaching on the incoming situation.

1425
01:33:34.72 --> 01:33:36.72
You have to detach from your current.

1426
01:33:36.72 --> 01:33:38.72
Yes, being nervous about the outcome.

1427
01:33:38.72 --> 01:33:39.72
Right, right.

1428
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:48.72
And that may help you prep and I'll talk about that a little bit, but the skill itself is being able to detach during the event.

1429
01:33:48.72 --> 01:34:03.72
And I'll tell you, once you do detach from it, it's actually pretty easy, but to punch through that gravity that your brain makes with emotion and chaos and mayhem, that's the hard part.

1430
01:34:03.72 --> 01:34:08.72
The hard part is to notice that you're stuck in the gravitational pull of all that emotion.

1431
01:34:08.72 --> 01:34:10.72
So you got to pay attention to that.

1432
01:34:10.72 --> 01:34:23.72
And what you really want to try and do is try and it's what you just said, trying to detach yourself before the gravity and the gravity of the emotions and the chaos builds up.

1433
01:34:23.72 --> 01:34:27.72
If you can detach before that, then you have to break through it.

1434
01:34:27.72 --> 01:34:29.72
You're already outside that realm.

1435
01:34:29.72 --> 01:34:32.72
And so then it's it's it's much easier.

1436
01:34:32.72 --> 01:34:35.72
So it's like there's quick sand in front of you.

1437
01:34:35.72 --> 01:34:40.72
And it's much easier to just see the quick stand and just say, I'm not going to step in there.

1438
01:34:40.72 --> 01:34:47.72
Then it is to walk in there, go up into your waist and start feeling, getting sucked down and then decide, oh, I'm going to pull myself out of that.

1439
01:34:47.72 --> 01:34:49.72
It's a lot harder.

1440
01:34:49.72 --> 01:34:50.72
Yeah.

1441
01:34:50.72 --> 01:34:54.72
So you got to look for those signs.

1442
01:34:54.72 --> 01:34:59.72
You got to look for that moment when you start feeling emotional or you know that it's going to be something emotional.

1443
01:34:59.72 --> 01:35:04.72
You got to step back from those and get get yourself in the habit of asking you to do that.

1444
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:08.72
Of asking yourself, what do I look like right now?

1445
01:35:08.72 --> 01:35:11.72
What does jacco look like right now?

1446
01:35:11.72 --> 01:35:15.72
What does jacco sound like right now?

1447
01:35:15.72 --> 01:35:26.72
Listen to yourself talk, listen to the words that are coming out of your mouth and see if you're being a reasonable human or not.

1448
01:35:26.72 --> 01:35:40.72
And I'll tell you one thing that I do, I kind of see is you know when I'm in the movie the Terminator when he sees like the various responses he could give.

1449
01:35:40.72 --> 01:35:50.72
Well, when I'm really in a very detached mode and I'm having a conversation with someone, I like see the options in my head of what I could say to him.

1450
01:35:50.72 --> 01:36:04.72
And I, oh yeah, that'll make a mad. Oh, yeah, that's too offensive. Okay, that's a good one. Hey buddy. But blah blah blah. So I think that that mindset kind of works pretty good, but again.

1451
01:36:04.72 --> 01:36:13.72
Look for the signs. Look for the quicksand. Look for the emotional quicksand and don't step in at the emotion of the anger or the frustration.

1452
01:36:13.72 --> 01:36:22.72
There's little physical signs too when you start feeling the sweat beating up when you start feeling hot like you literally start feeling hot.

1453
01:36:22.72 --> 01:36:28.72
That should be a big red flag. Yeah, that warmth that flushes through your face. That's not good.

1454
01:36:28.72 --> 01:36:30.72
Yeah.

1455
01:36:30.72 --> 01:36:39.72
The breathing when you start getting, when your breathing starts increasing your pulse was going, that's the stuff you've got to notice to say yourself, oh, there it is.

1456
01:36:39.72 --> 01:36:49.72
That's the quicksand of emotion and confusion and chaos. You don't want to step into it. You want to pull yourself back.

1457
01:36:49.72 --> 01:36:52.72
Take away there is like be like the terminator.

1458
01:36:52.72 --> 01:37:04.72
No, I'm not saying be like the terminator. That was a, that was a comparison of thinking of being able to visualize the options that you have.

1459
01:37:04.72 --> 01:37:10.72
And if you're emotional, you don't think like that when you're emotional, you're just you're just blurting out whenever he's going to come out of your mouth.

1460
01:37:10.72 --> 01:37:17.72
But when you're detached a little bit, you go, okay, I could say yes, I could say that. Oh, this is answered three and we say it.

1461
01:37:17.72 --> 01:37:18.72
It's like a problem solving.

1462
01:37:18.72 --> 01:37:18.72
Yeah.

1463
01:37:18.72 --> 01:37:18.72
Yeah.

1464
01:37:18.72 --> 01:37:19.72
Tactic.

1465
01:37:19.72 --> 01:37:23.72
You know, those should think it's interesting because on the terminator, he blurred it out.

1466
01:37:23.72 --> 01:37:28.72
And politically, he blurred it out an emotional response because he's acting like a person.

1467
01:37:28.72 --> 01:37:29.72
Remember that? Remember what he said?

1468
01:37:29.72 --> 01:37:30.72
I don't.

1469
01:37:30.72 --> 01:37:37.72
It's a bunch of profanity when he's using the thing, he's looking, he's all shut up and the superintendent or whatever, whatever.

1470
01:37:37.72 --> 01:37:40.72
It's knocking on the motel doors. Okay, buddy.

1471
01:37:40.72 --> 01:37:46.72
You got a dead cat and there what? Because all these flashes right, you know, so he looks through his responses and they're pretty funny. If you read him,

1472
01:37:46.72 --> 01:37:51.72
I forget exactly with your buddy, because the like poinichos was fucky, asshole.

1473
01:37:51.72 --> 01:37:52.72
That was it.

1474
01:37:52.72 --> 01:37:55.72
Instead of, you know, I do remember that.

1475
01:37:55.72 --> 01:37:55.72
Yeah.

1476
01:37:55.72 --> 01:37:56.72
That was pretty dope.

1477
01:37:56.72 --> 01:38:01.72
The fake emotions, which sometimes, which I've talked about before, sometimes you got to use the fake emotions.

1478
01:38:01.72 --> 01:38:02.72
The switcherule?

1479
01:38:02.72 --> 01:38:03.72
Yeah.

1480
01:38:03.72 --> 01:38:05.72
Or is that what's good for the goose?

1481
01:38:05.72 --> 01:38:06.72
It's good for the goose.

1482
01:38:06.72 --> 01:38:11.72
No, it's like when your kid is not getting, you're not listening to what you're saying.

1483
01:38:11.72 --> 01:38:13.72
You're not having the impact that you want to house.

1484
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:15.72
So you got to show a little bit of anger.

1485
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:15.72
Yeah, yeah.

1486
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72
Turn up heat.

1487
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.72
That's kind of good too.

1488
01:38:17.72 --> 01:38:19.72
And don't get crazy with it.

1489
01:38:19.72 --> 01:38:20.72
It's far as with the kids.

1490
01:38:20.72 --> 01:38:25.72
Where if you show anger, not only is it like a powerful thing in there, you're like, oh shoot, this is powerful.

1491
01:38:25.72 --> 01:38:29.72
It demonstrates to them that you care about what we're talking about right now.

1492
01:38:29.72 --> 01:38:30.72
I care about you.

1493
01:38:30.72 --> 01:38:31.72
Exactly.

1494
01:38:31.72 --> 01:38:34.72
You know, rather than I'm just a machine, a robot.

1495
01:38:34.72 --> 01:38:35.72
Yeah.

1496
01:38:35.72 --> 01:38:35.72
Yeah.

1497
01:38:35.72 --> 01:38:40.72
I don't care, but I know I'm supposed to tell you this kind of feeling.

1498
01:38:40.72 --> 01:38:41.72
Next question.

1499
01:38:41.72 --> 01:38:48.72
How do you deal with being evaluated specifically by different people with different opinions and motives?

1500
01:38:48.72 --> 01:38:49.72
Oh.

1501
01:38:49.72 --> 01:38:53.72
How do you deal with being evaluated?

1502
01:38:53.72 --> 01:38:59.72
Well, I can tell you right now.

1503
01:38:59.72 --> 01:39:02.72
Nobody likes being evaluated, right?

1504
01:39:02.72 --> 01:39:03.72
Nobody.

1505
01:39:03.72 --> 01:39:07.72
Now, you might get somebody that says, oh, I love being coached.

1506
01:39:07.72 --> 01:39:09.72
And there are some people that are pretty positive about that.

1507
01:39:09.72 --> 01:39:14.72
And as a matter of fact, I have clients where they want to be coached, right?

1508
01:39:14.72 --> 01:39:21.72
But most people, especially in a normal environment, like if you got new hire someone to coach you, okay?

1509
01:39:21.72 --> 01:39:26.72
But most people in a normal environment, they don't like being evaluated.

1510
01:39:26.72 --> 01:39:31.72
They don't like being judged, always judging.

1511
01:39:31.72 --> 01:39:41.72
So the first thing you have to do when it comes to being evaluated is get that in your head that you, like everybody else, has defense mechanisms.

1512
01:39:41.72 --> 01:39:47.72
And they're going to flare up as soon as somebody says something critical of you.

1513
01:39:47.72 --> 01:39:52.72
As soon as somebody goes to a value of you, your defense mechanisms are going to go up.

1514
01:39:52.72 --> 01:40:00.72
And then once that happens, once you feel those defense mechanisms go up, you got to put your ego in check.

1515
01:40:00.72 --> 01:40:04.72
You got to put your ego in check.

1516
01:40:04.72 --> 01:40:08.72
And then once you do that, you got to listen.

1517
01:40:08.72 --> 01:40:10.72
Listen, I know it sounds crazy.

1518
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:12.72
Listen to what they're saying.

1519
01:40:12.72 --> 01:40:16.72
Don't even think of a response.

1520
01:40:16.72 --> 01:40:19.72
Said to yourself, you know what, I'm not even going to respond.

1521
01:40:19.72 --> 01:40:22.72
I'm only going to listen to what they're saying.

1522
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:24.72
Yeah, but in to kind of actually.

1523
01:40:24.72 --> 01:40:25.72
You already can't even take it.

1524
01:40:25.72 --> 01:40:26.72
No, no, I can't take it.

1525
01:40:26.72 --> 01:40:31.72
Oh, I'm saying, but I think because people will quote unquote do that, but they won't really do it.

1526
01:40:31.72 --> 01:40:33.72
As far as just, I'm not going to say anything.

1527
01:40:33.72 --> 01:40:35.72
I'm just going to listen there.

1528
01:40:35.72 --> 01:40:38.72
That's actually, that's actually how they set it up to look.

1529
01:40:38.72 --> 01:40:39.72
I'm not even saying anything.

1530
01:40:39.72 --> 01:40:40.72
I'm just going to listen.

1531
01:40:40.72 --> 01:40:42.72
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

1532
01:40:42.72 --> 01:40:47.72
Or they'll all body language.

1533
01:40:47.72 --> 01:40:50.72
You know, they'll do that kind of stuff.

1534
01:40:50.72 --> 01:40:51.72
Don't do that.

1535
01:40:51.72 --> 01:40:55.72
So, so you're right, you got to listen and not just listen, but truly listen.

1536
01:40:55.72 --> 01:40:58.72
Not listen, just with your ears, but listen with your mind and your brain.

1537
01:40:58.72 --> 01:41:02.72
And with an open mind, an open mind.

1538
01:41:02.72 --> 01:41:04.72
And then think about what people are saying.

1539
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:05.72
And then see it.

1540
01:41:05.72 --> 01:41:08.72
It's important to see it from their perspective.

1541
01:41:08.72 --> 01:41:13.72
You're not even seeing what the criticism really is.

1542
01:41:13.72 --> 01:41:17.72
You're only seeing the defense of the criticism.

1543
01:41:17.72 --> 01:41:22.72
So actually, get in their mind and say, wow, what does this look like from their perspective?

1544
01:41:22.72 --> 01:41:29.72
Why would they be taking the effort and the risk and the challenge of trying to present this problem to me?

1545
01:41:29.72 --> 01:41:33.72
If it wasn't important, are they just doing it just to make me mad?

1546
01:41:33.72 --> 01:41:35.72
No, they're trying to help you.

1547
01:41:35.72 --> 01:41:43.72
And you know what? Just like a joke, you know, they say like every joke has some little truth to it.

1548
01:41:43.72 --> 01:41:48.72
Every little criticism, even if the person is your arch rival.

1549
01:41:48.72 --> 01:41:53.72
Their criticism is built on something.

1550
01:41:53.72 --> 01:41:58.72
So, what is that reality that you can take away from it?

1551
01:41:58.72 --> 01:42:01.72
Even though you got to take it with a grain of salt, especially if the person like it says here,

1552
01:42:01.72 --> 01:42:04.72
if the person has different opinions and motives, well, of course they have different opinions.

1553
01:42:04.72 --> 01:42:06.72
You want people with different opinions.

1554
01:42:06.72 --> 01:42:08.72
Maybe they have different motives.

1555
01:42:08.72 --> 01:42:12.72
So maybe you think they're trying to you serve your authority or something like that.

1556
01:42:12.72 --> 01:42:20.72
So, you maybe you got to take it with a grain of salt, but find the grain of truth in there too

1557
01:42:20.72 --> 01:42:27.72
and find what it is from their perspective, what the problem is, and learn from it.

1558
01:42:27.72 --> 01:42:33.72
And one of the most beautiful things about this is you take the criticism and you make adjustments.

1559
01:42:33.72 --> 01:42:37.72
You know, how do I deal with about being evaluated?

1560
01:42:37.72 --> 01:42:42.72
I try and accept the evaluation and make adjustments to improve myself as a human.

1561
01:42:42.72 --> 01:42:47.72
That's how I deal with being evaluated.

1562
01:42:47.72 --> 01:42:50.72
And I'm not saying I deal with it anybody better than anybody else,

1563
01:42:50.72 --> 01:42:54.72
because everybody gets defensive myself included.

1564
01:42:54.72 --> 01:42:58.72
You know, we had a little conversation when we started tonight.

1565
01:42:58.72 --> 01:42:59.72
Right?

1566
01:42:59.72 --> 01:43:05.72
Sure. You said I repeated some stuff on the last podcast, allegedly.

1567
01:43:05.72 --> 01:43:09.72
And you know, and then we talked through it.

1568
01:43:09.72 --> 01:43:15.72
And then I said, you know, and you know, I noticed that your camera work was a little bit off.

1569
01:43:15.72 --> 01:43:19.72
And you know, it was just the point was just to prove how defensive we all get.

1570
01:43:19.72 --> 01:43:20.72
Can we all get?

1571
01:43:20.72 --> 01:43:21.72
And you know what I did?

1572
01:43:21.72 --> 01:43:22.72
I said, you know what?

1573
01:43:22.72 --> 01:43:23.72
I noticed that too.

1574
01:43:23.72 --> 01:43:26.72
You know, but as far as me repeating, there was a couple little sections.

1575
01:43:26.72 --> 01:43:29.72
And it was because we pulled, I pulled from multiple different books.

1576
01:43:29.72 --> 01:43:32.72
And they had a little bit of overlap.

1577
01:43:32.72 --> 01:43:38.72
And looking back on it, probably shouldn't have, but at that time I thought, you know what?

1578
01:43:38.72 --> 01:43:41.72
This is emphasizing really important points.

1579
01:43:41.72 --> 01:43:42.72
Yeah.

1580
01:43:42.72 --> 01:43:45.72
But still, people don't want to hear the same thing over and over again.

1581
01:43:45.72 --> 01:43:47.72
So I probably shouldn't have done that.

1582
01:43:47.72 --> 01:43:50.72
So guess what? Criticism accepted.

1583
01:43:50.72 --> 01:43:51.72
Right on.

1584
01:43:51.72 --> 01:43:55.72
I will adapt a just and I will make improvements to my game based on your criticism of my

1585
01:43:55.72 --> 01:43:58.72
technique, my skill, and my life.

1586
01:43:58.72 --> 01:44:01.72
I didn't accept your criticism about the camera work.

1587
01:44:01.72 --> 01:44:02.72
No, you don't.

1588
01:44:02.72 --> 01:44:03.72
You don't know anything about camera.

1589
01:44:03.72 --> 01:44:04.72
There it is.

1590
01:44:04.72 --> 01:44:05.72
There it is.

1591
01:44:05.72 --> 01:44:07.72
You're sure you don't tell me.

1592
01:44:07.72 --> 01:44:09.72
Can't tell echo anything.

1593
01:44:09.72 --> 01:44:10.72
Yeah.

1594
01:44:10.72 --> 01:44:12.72
Can't tell echo anything.

1595
01:44:12.72 --> 01:44:14.72
Take their criticisms.

1596
01:44:14.72 --> 01:44:15.72
Fix the problem.

1597
01:44:15.72 --> 01:44:16.72
That's what it's all about.

1598
01:44:16.72 --> 01:44:18.72
You're using to get better.

1599
01:44:18.72 --> 01:44:19.72
Next question.

1600
01:44:19.72 --> 01:44:26.72
Jockel, echo. What are your guilty pleasures other than donuts?

1601
01:44:26.72 --> 01:44:29.72
And by the way, I don't even like donuts. That's pure echo right there.

1602
01:44:29.72 --> 01:44:30.72
Yeah.

1603
01:44:30.72 --> 01:44:32.72
You're talking about, you had a donut delivery.

1604
01:44:32.72 --> 01:44:33.72
It's sorry.

1605
01:44:33.72 --> 01:44:34.72
Let me finish the question.

1606
01:44:34.72 --> 01:44:36.72
What are your guilty pleasures other than donuts?

1607
01:44:36.72 --> 01:44:41.72
Jockel, what do you do when you momentarily give in to a voice or something that you

1608
01:44:41.72 --> 01:44:44.72
know is bad for you mentally or physically?

1609
01:44:44.72 --> 01:44:48.72
I like the fact that the people that are asking this is actually two questions in one.

1610
01:44:48.72 --> 01:44:52.72
I appreciate the fact that this person says,

1611
01:44:52.72 --> 01:44:56.72
Jockel, what do you do when you momentarily give into a voice?

1612
01:44:56.72 --> 01:45:02.72
I appreciate that as if I'm this person that could only for a fraction of a moment

1613
01:45:02.72 --> 01:45:06.72
give into any form of voice because I am not a human.

1614
01:45:06.72 --> 01:45:07.72
Yeah.

1615
01:45:07.72 --> 01:45:08.72
So I appreciate that.

1616
01:45:08.72 --> 01:45:10.72
You know, the part I appreciate about this question.

1617
01:45:10.72 --> 01:45:13.72
The first part asked both of us specifically,

1618
01:45:13.72 --> 01:45:14.72
Jockel and echo.

1619
01:45:14.72 --> 01:45:16.72
What are your guilty pleasures?

1620
01:45:16.72 --> 01:45:19.72
The second part asked,

1621
01:45:19.72 --> 01:45:21.72
the second part asked,

1622
01:45:21.72 --> 01:45:26.72
Jockel overly excluding many.

1623
01:45:26.72 --> 01:45:27.72
So Jockel,

1624
01:45:27.72 --> 01:45:31.72
what do you do when you momentarily give into a voice or something that you,

1625
01:45:31.72 --> 01:45:36.72
and the way I see this is that you do something about it if you momentarily give in.

1626
01:45:36.72 --> 01:45:38.72
Me if I momentarily give in like,

1627
01:45:38.72 --> 01:45:40.72
no, no one wants to hear my advice because it probably doesn't work.

1628
01:45:40.72 --> 01:45:43.72
Oh, because I like your sake is it just gave over at that point?

1629
01:45:43.72 --> 01:45:44.72
It is giving over to something.

1630
01:45:44.72 --> 01:45:48.72
Or you could take it the fact that they don't even think you ever break.

1631
01:45:48.72 --> 01:45:50.72
Yeah, that's what we're talking about eating.

1632
01:45:50.72 --> 01:45:52.72
Sleeves Oreo cookies on here.

1633
01:45:52.72 --> 01:45:54.72
So that's an issue.

1634
01:45:54.72 --> 01:45:57.72
But to get down to it, I think.

1635
01:45:57.72 --> 01:45:59.72
Wait, what are your guilty pleasures though?

1636
01:45:59.72 --> 01:46:01.72
guilty pleasures.

1637
01:46:01.72 --> 01:46:04.72
Number one first and foremost.

1638
01:46:04.72 --> 01:46:06.72
Ment chocolate chip ice cream.

1639
01:46:06.72 --> 01:46:12.72
And especially Ment chocolate chip ice cream milkshakes.

1640
01:46:12.72 --> 01:46:19.72
And I do some twisted things in my brain to convince myself that those are actually good for me.

1641
01:46:19.72 --> 01:46:23.72
And that they contain just enough carbs and they're some protein in there.

1642
01:46:23.72 --> 01:46:26.72
And there's some fat and it's actually like a full good meal,

1643
01:46:26.72 --> 01:46:29.72
which is just a big lie because it's a big sugar bomb.

1644
01:46:29.72 --> 01:46:30.72
Like a supplement.

1645
01:46:30.72 --> 01:46:31.72
Right.

1646
01:46:31.72 --> 01:46:36.72
So, but I do, I love Ment chocolate chip ice cream.

1647
01:46:36.72 --> 01:46:39.72
I really love chocolate milk too.

1648
01:46:39.72 --> 01:46:43.72
And there's the bindi's articles floating around the internet.

1649
01:46:43.72 --> 01:46:44.72
That's good for you.

1650
01:46:44.72 --> 01:46:47.72
And it's best post-workout thing you can get.

1651
01:46:47.72 --> 01:46:48.72
And it's another thing.

1652
01:46:48.72 --> 01:46:54.72
It's like, okay, but the reality is it's sugar in milk.

1653
01:46:54.72 --> 01:46:59.72
And so again, I'll twist that one in my head.

1654
01:46:59.72 --> 01:47:04.72
And sometimes for 10 minutes, I'll convince myself that really that is the right thing to do.

1655
01:47:04.72 --> 01:47:07.72
Obviously, we've discussed on here before.

1656
01:47:07.72 --> 01:47:12.72
Those little damn, uh, pencil wrapped hot dogs that they serve in their food.

1657
01:47:12.72 --> 01:47:16.72
That have some kind of butter or something on them that just...

1658
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:17.72
Damn.

1659
01:47:17.72 --> 01:47:18.72
Yes, though.

1660
01:47:18.72 --> 01:47:21.72
I don't know who invented those things, but God bless them.

1661
01:47:21.72 --> 01:47:26.72
And then, you know, you know, the normal crap foods, the potato chips, the french fries, the whatever, the junk.

1662
01:47:26.72 --> 01:47:27.72
Okay.

1663
01:47:27.72 --> 01:47:36.72
So, am I immune to the genetic evolutions that human beings have been through that make us

1664
01:47:36.72 --> 01:47:45.72
desire sugary foods and the door things going off and firing at no, I'm not immune to those things.

1665
01:47:45.72 --> 01:47:51.72
When I... and I'll tell you, when I do, first of all, I like to earn those things, right?

1666
01:47:51.72 --> 01:47:54.72
I either earn them on the front end or the back end.

1667
01:47:54.72 --> 01:47:59.72
Like, one way or the other, like, I either busted my ass and it did a couple days of hard working out.

1668
01:47:59.72 --> 01:48:05.72
And all of a sudden, I'm, you know, I'm out with my kid and we're swinging by and all of a sudden, I see there's a lot.

1669
01:48:05.72 --> 01:48:07.72
It's a great job in the corner, you know what?

1670
01:48:07.72 --> 01:48:10.72
Hey, let's get a little ice cream, a little... little go-time.

1671
01:48:10.72 --> 01:48:18.72
And one thing I... when I do it, I don't like have guilt when I'm sitting there, I'm not going, oh my God, I can't believe I'm doing this.

1672
01:48:18.72 --> 01:48:24.72
No, I say man, this is an awesome, I'll desice cream milkshake taste great, this is great.

1673
01:48:24.72 --> 01:48:31.72
But later on, either that night or the next day, I earn that thing.

1674
01:48:31.72 --> 01:48:38.72
Put a little punishment in place, a little punitive, reprimand for slack behavior.

1675
01:48:38.72 --> 01:48:44.72
And I'll tell you the thing, yeah, I'll be careful of, is that it is a slippery slope.

1676
01:48:44.72 --> 01:48:52.72
And as you mentioned, like one potato chip can lead to 20 and it does lead to 20.

1677
01:48:52.72 --> 01:48:59.72
And even that is like, okay, understand, we had a, we had a derailment, right?

1678
01:48:59.72 --> 01:49:09.72
But don't let one day of bad food lead to another day of bad food and no working out.

1679
01:49:09.72 --> 01:49:13.72
Lead to, that's what happens. That's what makes you start off the rest.

1680
01:49:13.72 --> 01:49:21.72
And actually, I mean, there's like Tim Ferriss, he's got that thing where he does, it's something like six days in a row of eating, super clean.

1681
01:49:21.72 --> 01:49:27.72
And then on the seventh day, you actually, it's not just cheat day, you have to like just get after it

1682
01:49:27.72 --> 01:49:31.72
because your body has to get the shock of carbs and all this stuff.

1683
01:49:31.72 --> 01:49:35.72
There's another big lie like you can tell you can twist your day.

1684
01:49:35.72 --> 01:49:37.72
And it'll sound like, well, you know, Tim Ferriss do cheat.

1685
01:49:37.72 --> 01:49:39.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1686
01:49:39.72 --> 01:49:47.72
But you do have to be careful of the slippery slope that, for me, that's what I think happens.

1687
01:49:47.72 --> 01:49:53.72
I think, I don't believe in the stuff that you, you use up your will power throughout the day and you use it

1688
01:49:53.72 --> 01:49:59.72
up your discipline. I believe that your discipline decisions create more discipline decisions.

1689
01:49:59.72 --> 01:50:15.72
Now, if I do just have a disaster of a day, or if I have, let's say for whatever reason, I have a two day just gluttonous train wreck binge.

1690
01:50:15.72 --> 01:50:25.72
Where I'm just, where I just, for whatever, I lose the bubble, you know, and there's could be anything any number of things that could cause that maybe, you know, it's like multiple,

1691
01:50:25.72 --> 01:50:33.72
I don't know, bad situation with travel, then with an event, then with something that come home and it's a birthday party and they only think it's pizza and I'm like, you know what it's

1692
01:50:33.72 --> 01:50:39.72
Oh, and it's just done, right? Is it better to hold the line yet is?

1693
01:50:39.72 --> 01:50:46.72
If I do have one of those situations, then I'll usually react to that, you know, I'll earn it later.

1694
01:50:46.72 --> 01:50:53.72
If I go on a just a terrible food thing, I'll do some kind of a fast, I'll do like a 24 hour fast, maybe in a 48 hour fast.

1695
01:50:53.72 --> 01:50:56.72
I haven't done a 72 hour, but I'm gear and up to do a 72 hour.

1696
01:50:56.72 --> 01:51:03.72
What do you just, just clutter? Yeah, just drink water, just drink water. I did the 48 hour and it's actually nothing.

1697
01:51:03.72 --> 01:51:09.72
It was like no problem, no factor. I did everything normal, squatted, went surfing, did you get to?

1698
01:51:09.72 --> 01:51:15.72
There's some guys on the mat and I said, I was talking to a big Eric, you know, big Eric.

1699
01:51:15.72 --> 01:51:20.72
And I was, I had to tell you something we got done training this afternoon. This is on the second day of doing it.

1700
01:51:20.72 --> 01:51:26.72
And so we trained a bunch and you know, there's no factor and he's like, well, we're going to tell him and I said, I haven't eaten for 48 hours.

1701
01:51:26.72 --> 01:51:31.72
And I said, you know, I'm just trying this out and I feel completely normal.

1702
01:51:31.72 --> 01:51:40.72
So that's one of the things I'll do to recover and then I'll just do some kind of, you know, psych kind of hardcore workout.

1703
01:51:40.72 --> 01:51:45.72
You know, we, a body and motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest, tends to stay in rest.

1704
01:51:45.72 --> 01:51:49.72
Don't let the momentum start going the wrong way. You know what I mean?

1705
01:51:49.72 --> 01:51:57.72
Get that body back in motion, get back on track, snap yourself back into the discipline.

1706
01:51:57.72 --> 01:52:07.72
Cross some workouts, get after it and get on that path, the path of discipline and strength and stay there.

1707
01:52:07.72 --> 01:52:18.72
You mentioned the, the, given into the brain that you were evolved to have or when you know, and that's like seeking out sugar and fat and, you know,

1708
01:52:18.72 --> 01:52:19.72
fat's not bad.

1709
01:52:19.72 --> 01:52:23.72
Right, but that's what you revolve to want and it's for reasons.

1710
01:52:23.72 --> 01:52:27.72
So you know, put simply back when you were a came in. You didn't know when the next meal was coming from.

1711
01:52:27.72 --> 01:52:32.72
Yep. So, you know, you get that honey. You're that sugar, that, that, that, that is much,

1712
01:52:32.72 --> 01:52:34.72
calorie milk, you get, you get as much as you can.

1713
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:37.72
So your brain still like that.

1714
01:52:37.72 --> 01:52:43.72
So a good tactic and I use this and it crazed, crazily, it worked, it worked for drinking.

1715
01:52:43.72 --> 01:52:51.72
I mentioned this to before, where you just understand that your brain is in a way, playing a trick on you.

1716
01:52:51.72 --> 01:52:58.72
And if you give in literally by this model, you just fell for a trick.

1717
01:52:58.72 --> 01:53:00.12
And so now you know that, right?

1718
01:53:00.12 --> 01:53:06.20
So you're falling for a trick that is played on you by your own brain because it thinks

1719
01:53:06.20 --> 01:53:07.84
it's your still a caveman.

1720
01:53:07.84 --> 01:53:13.56
So you see these donuts or cake or I don't know, pizza, something delicious and fatty.

1721
01:53:13.56 --> 01:53:14.96
You mean what you had for dinner tonight?

1722
01:53:14.96 --> 01:53:19.20
Yeah, yeah, you see my dinner and your brain is...

1723
01:53:19.20 --> 01:53:22.000
Hey, let's do one of those situations though.

1724
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.76
It's your daughter's birthday party, right?

1725
01:53:23.76 --> 01:53:25.56
You got the family over.

1726
01:53:25.56 --> 01:53:26.56
What are you going to do?

1727
01:53:26.56 --> 01:53:28.56
Put them all on a paleo diet for the evening?

1728
01:53:28.56 --> 01:53:30.84
No, you're going to get them some pizza and ice cream and it's all good.

1729
01:53:30.84 --> 01:53:32.84
It's a little bit of cake for echo-chero.

1730
01:53:32.84 --> 01:53:35.08
Technically, that was lunch and then I had a salad for dinner.

1731
01:53:35.08 --> 01:53:36.08
Okay, good.

1732
01:53:36.08 --> 01:53:37.08
Exactly.

1733
01:53:37.08 --> 01:53:38.08
See, you just put your-

1734
01:53:38.08 --> 01:53:39.08
You're just here to back on the track.

1735
01:53:39.08 --> 01:53:40.08
Yeah, I like for that.

1736
01:53:40.08 --> 01:53:43.28
But so if you understand that you're...

1737
01:53:43.28 --> 01:53:45.88
You just fell for a trick right there.

1738
01:53:45.88 --> 01:53:49.16
So now going forward, you know or okay, if I have these cravings,

1739
01:53:49.16 --> 01:53:53.52
or that donut looks delicious and whatever way,

1740
01:53:53.52 --> 01:53:57.92
you're about to actively unconsciously fall for a trick right now.

1741
01:53:57.92 --> 01:53:58.92
Yeah.

1742
01:53:58.92 --> 01:54:00.92
There's no scarcity of food right now.

1743
01:54:00.92 --> 01:54:03.04
There's an abundance of food.

1744
01:54:03.04 --> 01:54:07.68
And you know what's a perfect phrase for this?

1745
01:54:07.68 --> 01:54:08.68
Don't be a sucker.

1746
01:54:08.68 --> 01:54:09.68
Yeah, exactly.

1747
01:54:09.68 --> 01:54:11.68
Like how often is it?

1748
01:54:11.68 --> 01:54:14.24
Like, that's like the worst thing someone can tell you.

1749
01:54:14.24 --> 01:54:15.24
That's what I knew.

1750
01:54:15.24 --> 01:54:16.24
You're a sucker.

1751
01:54:16.24 --> 01:54:17.24
That's why it works.

1752
01:54:17.24 --> 01:54:18.24
That's why it works for you.

1753
01:54:18.24 --> 01:54:19.08
Yeah.

1754
01:54:19.08 --> 01:54:20.08
Don't be a sucker.

1755
01:54:20.08 --> 01:54:24.48
So don't be a sucker to that piece of your brain that's trying to trick you into

1756
01:54:24.48 --> 01:54:26.80
wanting stuff that's actually bad for you.

1757
01:54:26.80 --> 01:54:27.80
Yeah.

1758
01:54:27.80 --> 01:54:30.92
So yeah, and so how the trick works is your brain is saying,

1759
01:54:30.92 --> 01:54:34.32
hey, those donuts, those are beneficial.

1760
01:54:34.32 --> 01:54:38.000
And look at all these, like you'll get your calories.

1761
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.44
Who knows when they're gonna come?

1762
01:54:39.44 --> 01:54:40.28
That's what your brain is.

1763
01:54:40.28 --> 01:54:41.68
That's how it feels.

1764
01:54:41.68 --> 01:54:43.56
They're gonna come when you order dominoes.

1765
01:54:43.56 --> 01:54:44.56
Yeah.

1766
01:54:44.56 --> 01:54:45.96
Yeah, that's the reality.

1767
01:54:45.96 --> 01:54:47.48
But your brain's not telling you that.

1768
01:54:47.48 --> 01:54:49.84
It's giving you a crack as you need all those calories.

1769
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:51.000
You don't know what it's gonna come.

1770
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.24
And look at all these benefits.

1771
01:54:52.24 --> 01:54:53.28
It's gonna taste good.

1772
01:54:53.28 --> 01:54:54.92
And this is what you need.

1773
01:54:54.92 --> 01:54:56.12
That's what your brain is telling you.

1774
01:54:56.12 --> 01:54:57.28
This is what you need.

1775
01:54:57.28 --> 01:54:59.68
But the reality is you don't live in that world anymore.

1776
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:02.08
Where you can get as many donuts as you want.

1777
01:55:02.08 --> 01:55:03.08
Now.

1778
01:55:03.08 --> 01:55:08.08
So it's tricky to think that the short term benefits are the benefits.

1779
01:55:09.36 --> 01:55:11.92
When in reality, since the world we live in now is different,

1780
01:55:11.92 --> 01:55:13.92
the long term benefits are the benefits.

1781
01:55:13.92 --> 01:55:14.76
Yes.

1782
01:55:14.76 --> 01:55:16.72
And they don't involve donuts.

1783
01:55:16.72 --> 01:55:17.72
They're drinking.

1784
01:55:17.72 --> 01:55:18.72
Don't be a soccer.

1785
01:55:18.72 --> 01:55:19.72
Don't be a soccer.

1786
01:55:19.72 --> 01:55:20.72
Yeah.

1787
01:55:20.72 --> 01:55:21.72
It helps.

1788
01:55:21.72 --> 01:55:23.72
If you care about being a soccer, though, that's the thing.

1789
01:55:23.72 --> 01:55:25.72
If you're like a soccer, about being a soccer.

1790
01:55:25.72 --> 01:55:27.72
There's no way to find another thing.

1791
01:55:27.72 --> 01:55:28.72
That's what I think too.

1792
01:55:28.72 --> 01:55:29.72
Yeah.

1793
01:55:29.72 --> 01:55:30.72
That's what I think too.

1794
01:55:30.72 --> 01:55:31.72
All right.

1795
01:55:31.72 --> 01:55:34.72
The next question.

1796
01:55:34.72 --> 01:55:40.08
Jocco is budd's the right filter for the kind of people you want in the

1797
01:55:40.08 --> 01:55:41.08
seal teams.

1798
01:55:41.08 --> 01:55:46.64
Does it filter out good people and lighten the bad?

1799
01:55:46.64 --> 01:55:51.000
So budd's is the basic underwater demolition and seal training.

1800
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.40
And it does a decent job.

1801
01:55:54.40 --> 01:55:58.40
And I'm not going to say that everybody that makes it through buds is a guy that you want

1802
01:55:58.40 --> 01:56:02.28
to work with or even a guy that you want on your team.

1803
01:56:02.28 --> 01:56:09.20
Because one thing that happens in budd's is that punishment is dealt out, right?

1804
01:56:09.20 --> 01:56:10.68
I mean, it's just suffering.

1805
01:56:10.68 --> 01:56:11.88
It's just hard work.

1806
01:56:11.88 --> 01:56:15.64
It's, you know, putting a boat on your head and being cold and wet and all this stuff.

1807
01:56:15.64 --> 01:56:17.52
And you either embrace that and crush it.

1808
01:56:17.52 --> 01:56:19.08
That's one way to get through.

1809
01:56:19.08 --> 01:56:22.08
That's the way you should get through.

1810
01:56:22.08 --> 01:56:31.96
But there are guys that they find a way to get by and to sneak by and to work the system.

1811
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:32.96
Right?

1812
01:56:32.96 --> 01:56:33.96
It does happen.

1813
01:56:33.96 --> 01:56:38.92
And those guys definitely exist in the teams than the real team guys, no those guys

1814
01:56:38.92 --> 01:56:39.92
are.

1815
01:56:39.92 --> 01:56:44.16
But one thing that's hard, it's hard for a civilian to know the difference.

1816
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:45.84
It's too as willing to seal seal.

1817
01:56:45.84 --> 01:56:47.84
If you have your trident, you're a seal.

1818
01:56:47.84 --> 01:56:48.84
You must be a badass.

1819
01:56:48.84 --> 01:56:52.84
So what is it like kind of like when your coach is saying, okay, everybody push

1820
01:56:52.84 --> 01:56:57.68
up for 60 seconds and he's looking around and when you see he's not looking at you,

1821
01:56:57.68 --> 01:56:58.68
you just kind of cruise.

1822
01:56:58.68 --> 01:56:59.68
There's all kinds of guys.

1823
01:56:59.68 --> 01:57:00.68
There's all kinds of guys.

1824
01:57:00.68 --> 01:57:03.24
There's all kinds of little corners that you can cut.

1825
01:57:03.24 --> 01:57:04.84
There's things you can get away with.

1826
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:09.68
And the weird thing about buds is, and I think, Dave talked about this when he was on the

1827
01:57:09.68 --> 01:57:14.12
podcast is, well, maybe he didn't maybe just had it in conversations.

1828
01:57:14.12 --> 01:57:20.000
But you have a mentality when you're going through buds is that you're a team and you're

1829
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.64
trying to help everyone get through.

1830
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:27.000
And so you don't like rat those guys out when you seem cut in corners.

1831
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000
You, it very seldom do you rat one of those guys out unless it's just an atrocious case.

1832
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.24
Most of the time guys are, you know, like, hey, man, are you okay?

1833
01:57:37.24 --> 01:57:42.16
Like, oh, and instructors coming, like they'll help people skate through.

1834
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:43.16
Right?

1835
01:57:43.16 --> 01:57:48.20
It's pretty negative when you get through buds and you're in the seal teams, then everyone

1836
01:57:48.20 --> 01:57:52.56
says to a man, we'll say, I wish I would help anyone get through because now they're in

1837
01:57:52.56 --> 01:57:54.88
the teams and now we can't count on them.

1838
01:57:54.88 --> 01:57:55.88
Oh, yeah.

1839
01:57:55.88 --> 01:57:57.24
And now we got to carry their weight.

1840
01:57:57.24 --> 01:58:05.16
So, so it is definitely a test of making it through, but there's two ways to make it

1841
01:58:05.16 --> 01:58:06.16
through.

1842
01:58:06.16 --> 01:58:09.04
You can crush it and survive it.

1843
01:58:09.04 --> 01:58:13.20
Or you can sneak through it and skate through it and it does happen.

1844
01:58:13.20 --> 01:58:16.44
Now, it's also mainly a physical test.

1845
01:58:16.44 --> 01:58:18.08
And people talk about no, it's mental.

1846
01:58:18.08 --> 01:58:19.08
It's physical, right?

1847
01:58:19.08 --> 01:58:21.52
There's a mental aspect to it, no doubt.

1848
01:58:21.52 --> 01:58:29.04
And if you're not mentally committed to making it through, then it's going to be hard

1849
01:58:29.04 --> 01:58:30.04
for you.

1850
01:58:30.04 --> 01:58:31.84
But it's primarily a physical test.

1851
01:58:31.84 --> 01:58:35.04
And physicality is actually a small part of being a seal.

1852
01:58:35.04 --> 01:58:38.72
Now, of course, it's like a baseline factor.

1853
01:58:38.72 --> 01:58:39.72
I mean, it is a factor.

1854
01:58:39.72 --> 01:58:44.36
As a seal, you've got to be able to do the job physically.

1855
01:58:44.36 --> 01:58:48.80
But that's the baseline, right?

1856
01:58:48.80 --> 01:58:55.72
And being a good athlete is definitely, that does definitely not automatically make someone

1857
01:58:55.72 --> 01:59:02.24
a great seal because there's guys that go through buds that are studs physically.

1858
01:59:02.24 --> 01:59:04.72
And we get the seal teams.

1859
01:59:04.72 --> 01:59:05.96
They're not good.

1860
01:59:05.96 --> 01:59:06.96
They're not good seals.

1861
01:59:06.96 --> 01:59:08.60
They might be a bad leader.

1862
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:09.92
They might be unsafe.

1863
01:59:09.92 --> 01:59:10.92
They can't shoot.

1864
01:59:10.92 --> 01:59:12.44
They can't handle the pressure.

1865
01:59:12.44 --> 01:59:14.64
Or they can't handle the grind.

1866
01:59:14.64 --> 01:59:18.56
Because you get a guy that's an elite level ax athlete.

1867
01:59:18.56 --> 01:59:19.56
And guess what?

1868
01:59:19.56 --> 01:59:21.92
He's used to elite level food.

1869
01:59:21.92 --> 01:59:27.12
He's used to elite level of treatment.

1870
01:59:27.12 --> 01:59:29.40
He's used to an elite level of rest.

1871
01:59:29.40 --> 01:59:30.40
And you get to the seal teams.

1872
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:31.80
There's no elite food.

1873
01:59:31.80 --> 01:59:32.80
There's no elite treatment.

1874
01:59:32.80 --> 01:59:33.80
There's no elite rest.

1875
01:59:33.80 --> 01:59:35.04
There's just grind.

1876
01:59:35.04 --> 01:59:37.44
And you're out the desert.

1877
01:59:37.44 --> 01:59:40.20
And you're just going on an operation after operation after operation.

1878
01:59:40.20 --> 01:59:44.44
And some of these high level athletes, there's such a fine tuned machine.

1879
01:59:44.44 --> 01:59:45.76
It's like we talked about before.

1880
01:59:45.76 --> 01:59:49.44
They're like a poor shore race car and what you want to be as a 4 by 4.

1881
01:59:49.44 --> 01:59:52.64
You can put diesel or bio fuel or whatever into that engine.

1882
01:59:52.64 --> 01:59:54.04
It's going to keep running.

1883
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:57.64
You have to put the high octane clean stuff into the sports car.

1884
01:59:57.64 --> 02:00:00.36
And some of those guys break down on that.

1885
02:00:00.36 --> 02:00:04.52
And the reason is, like I said, is because the seal teams is not buds training.

1886
02:00:04.52 --> 02:00:08.76
And I've said, be this before.

1887
02:00:08.76 --> 02:00:10.72
No one in the seal team cares about buds training.

1888
02:00:10.72 --> 02:00:16.16
Once you've gotten through buds, it's like as normal as brushing your teeth.

1889
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:17.16
Everyone's done it.

1890
02:00:17.16 --> 02:00:19.000
No one says, hey, did you brush your teeth?

1891
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.24
No, we all brush your teeth.

1892
02:00:20.24 --> 02:00:21.24
We all went through buds.

1893
02:00:21.24 --> 02:00:26.40
It's not that big of a deal.

1894
02:00:26.40 --> 02:00:28.12
One thing that buds does do good.

1895
02:00:28.12 --> 02:00:33.12
Though is it does do a good job of finding people's weaknesses and whether it's swimming

1896
02:00:33.12 --> 02:00:37.84
or whether it's running or whether it's the obstacle, whether it's whether it's lack of sleep

1897
02:00:37.84 --> 02:00:41.20
or being in the water and the water work that they make you do.

1898
02:00:41.20 --> 02:00:46.64
If you have a weakness of any of those areas, it's going to show.

1899
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:50.04
It's going to show.

1900
02:00:50.04 --> 02:00:55.72
But again, some guys do find a way to make it through and they end up in the teams and

1901
02:00:55.72 --> 02:00:59.12
they end up doing a couple of seal platoons.

1902
02:00:59.12 --> 02:01:05.72
But again, being just being a seal doesn't make you a badass.

1903
02:01:05.72 --> 02:01:06.72
That's just the truth.

1904
02:01:06.72 --> 02:01:08.52
It doesn't make you a great leader.

1905
02:01:08.52 --> 02:01:10.72
It doesn't make you a tactical expert.

1906
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:13.04
It just doesn't.

1907
02:01:13.04 --> 02:01:16.88
It means that you made it through the training and you survived a couple of seal platoons.

1908
02:01:16.88 --> 02:01:18.04
That's what it means.

1909
02:01:18.04 --> 02:01:25.72
Now, there are plenty of seals that are badass and great leaders and definitely some tactical

1910
02:01:25.72 --> 02:01:26.72
experts.

1911
02:01:26.72 --> 02:01:30.76
It certainly isn't every seal.

1912
02:01:30.76 --> 02:01:36.40
Because there's a bell curve in the seal teams, a bell curve, just like any other group

1913
02:01:36.40 --> 02:01:39.28
of people or any other organization.

1914
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:47.56
And at the top of the bell curve, you've got a bunch of relentless, unstoppable warriors

1915
02:01:47.56 --> 02:01:52.52
that carry more than they're share of the way in the teams.

1916
02:01:52.52 --> 02:02:01.24
And these are the guys that have built or are building the reputation that the seal teams

1917
02:02:01.24 --> 02:02:02.76
have.

1918
02:02:02.76 --> 02:02:05.96
And then in the middle of the curve, that's where you got the bulk of the guys and these

1919
02:02:05.96 --> 02:02:06.96
are great guys.

1920
02:02:06.96 --> 02:02:07.96
They're great seals.

1921
02:02:07.96 --> 02:02:12.08
They do the job and they do it well and they're outstanding professional combat

1922
02:02:12.08 --> 02:02:13.64
troopers.

1923
02:02:13.64 --> 02:02:15.52
Who get the job done?

1924
02:02:15.52 --> 02:02:20.68
And they get the job done on time and on target.

1925
02:02:20.68 --> 02:02:27.28
And those are awesome solid guys that maintain the reputation of the seal teams.

1926
02:02:27.28 --> 02:02:30.28
They maintain it.

1927
02:02:30.28 --> 02:02:33.000
And then you got the crew at the bottom.

1928
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.48
And these are the guys that slip through the cracks.

1929
02:02:35.48 --> 02:02:36.80
They work the system.

1930
02:02:36.80 --> 02:02:44.12
And while they're technically classified as seals, these aren't guys that are like respected

1931
02:02:44.12 --> 02:02:47.04
by other guys and the seal teams.

1932
02:02:47.04 --> 02:02:52.16
And quite honestly, these are usually the guys that talk the most and brag the most about

1933
02:02:52.16 --> 02:02:55.28
being a seal.

1934
02:02:55.28 --> 02:02:59.52
And these are the guys that they don't build the reputation or maintain the reputation

1935
02:02:59.52 --> 02:03:00.52
of seal teams.

1936
02:03:00.52 --> 02:03:06.16
These are the guys that live off the reputation of the seal teams.

1937
02:03:06.16 --> 02:03:14.80
When, in all likelihood, they probably haven't contributed anything themselves to that reputation.

1938
02:03:14.80 --> 02:03:21.80
But that is what it is.

1939
02:03:21.80 --> 02:03:28.44
And as I always say, the teams gave me everything.

1940
02:03:28.44 --> 02:03:30.64
The good, the bad.

1941
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:35.24
And the ugly and I wouldn't change a thing.

1942
02:03:35.24 --> 02:03:37.28
I love the seal teams.

1943
02:03:37.28 --> 02:03:40.40
The frog man.

1944
02:03:40.40 --> 02:03:43.60
The AW Gunner in a seal platoon.

1945
02:03:43.60 --> 02:03:49.72
The point man, the corpsman, the radio man, the rear security.

1946
02:03:49.72 --> 02:03:52.16
Little po tune chief.

1947
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:54.72
Then the LPO.

1948
02:03:54.72 --> 02:03:59.84
And the OIC and the AOIC.

1949
02:03:59.84 --> 02:04:04.48
Those guys, those guys in a seal platoon.

1950
02:04:04.48 --> 02:04:07.88
The ones that carry the weight and carry the torch.

1951
02:04:07.88 --> 02:04:12.40
Those guys are in my blood.

1952
02:04:12.40 --> 02:04:15.92
I love those guys and I always will.

1953
02:04:15.92 --> 02:04:16.92
OK.

1954
02:04:16.92 --> 02:04:19.44
Last question.

1955
02:04:19.44 --> 02:04:23.64
Jocco, what does discipline really mean?

1956
02:04:23.64 --> 02:04:29.52
Besides waking up early and how do I employ it to all aspects of my life?

1957
02:04:29.52 --> 02:04:32.16
What does it really mean?

1958
02:04:32.16 --> 02:04:38.60
Yes, discipline does start with waking up early.

1959
02:04:38.60 --> 02:04:41.44
It really does.

1960
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:44.40
And that is just the beginning.

1961
02:04:44.40 --> 02:04:52.36
And I always say that discipline is the root of all good qualities.

1962
02:04:52.36 --> 02:05:00.12
But you have to absolutely apply it to things outside of just waking up early.

1963
02:05:00.12 --> 02:05:01.12
It's everything.

1964
02:05:01.12 --> 02:05:09.56
It's working now every day, making yourself stronger and faster and more flexible and healthier.

1965
02:05:09.56 --> 02:05:19.000
One is eating right foods to fuel your system.

1966
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.12
It's about disciplining your emotions.

1967
02:05:22.12 --> 02:05:23.88
So you can make good decisions.

1968
02:05:23.88 --> 02:05:29.36
It's about having the discipline to control your ego.

1969
02:05:29.36 --> 02:05:36.32
So your ego doesn't get out of hand and control you.

1970
02:05:36.32 --> 02:05:43.72
It's about treating people the way you would want to be treated and doing the tasks that

1971
02:05:43.72 --> 02:05:52.04
you don't necessarily want to do, but that you know will help you or help your team.

1972
02:05:52.04 --> 02:05:58.40
It's about facing your fears.

1973
02:05:58.40 --> 02:06:06.76
It's discipline to face your fears so you can conquer them.

1974
02:06:06.76 --> 02:06:08.36
And that's what discipline is.

1975
02:06:08.36 --> 02:06:15.32
Discipline means taking the hard road, the uphill road to do what's right for yourself

1976
02:06:15.32 --> 02:06:22.36
and for other people.

1977
02:06:22.36 --> 02:06:26.32
It's so often the easy path.

1978
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:34.68
The easy path it calls to us to be weak for that moment, to break down for that moment,

1979
02:06:34.68 --> 02:06:42.80
to give in to the desire and the short term gratification.

1980
02:06:42.80 --> 02:06:46.000
But the discipline will not allow that.

1981
02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:53.44
The discipline calls for strength and fortitude and will.

1982
02:06:53.44 --> 02:07:01.60
It won't accept weakness, it won't tolerate another breakdown.

1983
02:07:01.60 --> 02:07:10.80
The discipline can seem like it's your worst enemy.

1984
02:07:10.80 --> 02:07:16.48
But the reality is discipline is your best friend.

1985
02:07:16.48 --> 02:07:19.20
It will take care of you like nothing else can.

1986
02:07:19.20 --> 02:07:34.92
It will put you on that path, the path to strength and health and intelligence and happiness.

1987
02:07:34.92 --> 02:07:42.32
And most importantly, it'll put you on that path to freedom.

1988
02:07:42.32 --> 02:07:56.24
And I think that's all we've got for tonight.

1989
02:07:56.24 --> 02:08:06.68
So thanks everybody out there for putting on those headphones and listening to this podcast.

1990
02:08:06.68 --> 02:08:08.24
Thanks for the feedback.

1991
02:08:08.24 --> 02:08:14.36
You give us it's definitely good to know that people are listening and getting something

1992
02:08:14.36 --> 02:08:17.12
out of it.

1993
02:08:17.12 --> 02:08:22.48
Also thanks for subscribing and reviewing and spreading the word and thanks to on it for

1994
02:08:22.48 --> 02:08:27.16
the support, for the great products that they make.

1995
02:08:27.16 --> 02:08:37.60
We appreciate that and please support them for supporting us and speaking of support

1996
02:08:37.60 --> 02:08:45.20
another big way you can support us and the podcast is if you want to buy something

1997
02:08:45.20 --> 02:08:53.80
anything, especially the books that we talk about, go through our website to get to amazon.com.

1998
02:08:53.80 --> 02:08:56.08
Echo, how do they do that?

1999
02:08:56.08 --> 02:09:03.88
Just like how you said, just instead of going straight to amazon.com, go to jocopadguess.com

2000
02:09:03.88 --> 02:09:10.36
or jocopadguess too.com or jocobotguess.

2001
02:09:10.36 --> 02:09:14.000
So jocopadguess.com and that's if they're going to buy anything.

2002
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Yeah, anything.

2003
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.88
Yeah, the books or anything, if you want to buy some duct tape.

2004
02:09:19.88 --> 02:09:23.40
Get that duct tape through jocopadguess.com.

2005
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:24.40
That's awesome.

2006
02:09:24.40 --> 02:09:25.40
Yeah, I do that.

2007
02:09:25.40 --> 02:09:30.24
And when you go to on it, go to on o nint.com slash jocco.

2008
02:09:30.24 --> 02:09:34.12
Okay, I think it's an alpha brain.

2009
02:09:34.12 --> 02:09:36.16
The cognitive start taking.

2010
02:09:36.16 --> 02:09:38.96
It's a start bringing the thought up.

2011
02:09:38.96 --> 02:09:40.12
Yeah, prove the mind.

2012
02:09:40.12 --> 02:09:43.32
And if you're going to get after it on a hard workout, get some shrimp tech.

2013
02:09:43.32 --> 02:09:44.32
Highly recommend.

2014
02:09:44.32 --> 02:09:45.32
Do you like your bad tech?

2015
02:09:45.32 --> 02:09:46.32
Yeah, you'd be glad you did.

2016
02:09:46.32 --> 02:09:47.32
For sure.

2017
02:09:47.32 --> 02:09:48.32
The shrimp tech.

2018
02:09:48.32 --> 02:09:49.32
Yeah.

2019
02:09:49.32 --> 02:09:52.32
You know, awesome.

2020
02:09:52.32 --> 02:09:53.92
We really appreciate that support again.

2021
02:09:53.92 --> 02:09:59.56
That's how Echo Charles is hosting all this stuff and paying for all this stuff.

2022
02:09:59.56 --> 02:10:00.56
And all that.

2023
02:10:00.56 --> 02:10:02.40
So it's much appreciated.

2024
02:10:02.40 --> 02:10:07.48
If you want to talk to us or engage with us or ask us questions, you can find us on the

2025

I am at jocco willing.

2027
02:10:12.12 --> 02:10:17.32
And of course, echo Charles is at echo Charles.

2028
02:10:17.32 --> 02:10:22.56
Thanks for leaving reviews of the podcast on iTunes.

2029
02:10:22.56 --> 02:10:28.16
That helps us with the rank and gets us pushed up and gets us more listeners.

2030
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:35.08
So if you bought the book Extreme Ownership that late for an I wrote, jump on Amazon, throw

2031
02:10:35.08 --> 02:10:36.56
a review up there.

2032
02:10:36.56 --> 02:10:40.80
That helps us out as well.

2033
02:10:40.80 --> 02:10:43.16
Man, we're asking a lot of the people.

2034
02:10:43.16 --> 02:10:50.20
Yeah, I feel like everyone was kind of doing that anyway though.

2035
02:10:50.20 --> 02:10:52.08
You know, I think.

2036
02:10:52.08 --> 02:10:53.08
Who's everyone?

2037
02:10:53.08 --> 02:10:55.64
The people, the people.

2038
02:10:55.64 --> 02:10:56.64
The people.

2039
02:10:56.64 --> 02:11:00.24
So the biggest thing is spread the word.

2040
02:11:00.24 --> 02:11:01.72
Spread the word.

2041
02:11:01.72 --> 02:11:03.56
If you want, if you feel like it.

2042
02:11:03.56 --> 02:11:04.56
Yeah.

2043
02:11:04.56 --> 02:11:07.000
If it's been worth your while, spread the word.

2044
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:17.12
And you know, really most importantly to you, you, you, that's listening to this.

2045
02:11:17.12 --> 02:11:24.16
That's trying to get better, trying to be better, trying to do better.

2046
02:11:24.16 --> 02:11:31.28
Thank you for getting out there and getting after it.

2047
02:11:31.28 --> 02:11:39.60
Because when you make yourself better, you make the world better.

2048
02:11:39.60 --> 02:12:03.04
And so until next time, this is Jocco and Echo out.
