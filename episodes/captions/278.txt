[00:00:00] This is Jockelpond cast number 278 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:10] It's a little cold outside, but it doesn't matter.
[00:00:18] Nothing else matters right now, except doing my job right.
[00:00:24] This job.
[00:00:30] I take another step as gently as I can, as quietly as I can.
[00:00:40] This is where it all matters.
[00:00:44] I can't let them hear me. If they do, they'll be gone.
[00:00:50] Then I won't get my shot.
[00:00:57] I take another quiet step. I see my buddy freeze.
[00:01:03] He sees them.
[00:01:07] They must be in range.
[00:01:11] My buddy slowly looks back at me and gives me a nod.
[00:01:16] It's go time.
[00:01:23] I prepare my weapon.
[00:01:29] By now, I know this weapon well,
[00:01:33] I've shot thousands of rounds through it in the last year for this moment.
[00:01:39] Ever since I was a little kid, it's been this way.
[00:01:47] Stocking through the woods, closing the distance, trying to see without being seen.
[00:01:53] My adult life was much of the same sneaking around in the woods or in the desert or in the city or in the jungle.
[00:02:10] I take a few more steps and find some cover by a tree. This will keep me hidden.
[00:02:16] My buddy gives me a hand signal. He's given me the range.
[00:02:26] Nothing else matters. I initiate the procedures.
[00:02:34] My mind is full, but it's empty. My heart is beating, but it's steady. It all comes down to this moment.
[00:02:41] I'm alive.
[00:02:53] Now that may have sounded like a combat scenario,
[00:02:59] but it wasn't. It was a description of a more recent pursuit of mine.
[00:03:05] Everybody je≈ºeli.
[00:03:10] I'm miserable.
[00:03:13] I got taken in just a single region.
[00:03:18] potent recovery, a recent public recovery.
[00:03:22] Madame Marianne, president of California,
[00:03:26] a friend that is always ready to help. Not just me, but an entire community of people. The world
[00:03:36] renowned founder of knock-on-artry, John Dudley. Dud? What's up, man? Thanks for coming on.
[00:03:45] It's a story. That was awesome. It was a fire, right? Yeah, especially this season where we were
[00:03:55] on a lot of bowls and that happened that little thing played out time and time and time.
[00:04:01] Time and time again. I ended up not getting any shots off, but man. It was freaking fun.
[00:04:08] All right, man. Let's go. There's a lot of people that really don't know much about you.
[00:04:13] And let's go back to the beginning because I have heard peace together stories of your life.
[00:04:21] And there's a lot of good ones, man. It's always surprising that you're here. You
[00:04:26] weren't arrested. You're not prison. You're not dead. You know, there's a lot of different
[00:04:31] men. Yeah. Abonus, you could have headed down. Dang, right? Yeah. Just a horrible.
[00:04:37] I don't deserve my wife or my son. Just like all the time. I'm just like karma.
[00:04:43] Like he's that real patient sniper. And at some point, like I don't think he's made any fire yet.
[00:04:49] If he has, they've been off so much. I haven't heard him come by, but like I'm still waiting
[00:04:55] just to get sniped because I deserve it if it happened. All right. So where were you born?
[00:05:02] Fort Bragg. Cud your dad was an army. Yep. Yep. And is that where you did you spend any time in
[00:05:08] Fort Bragg? Do you remember if you spent any time in Fort Bragg? I don't remember it. No, I don't
[00:05:12] remember it because it was it was 76 and then I think by 77 we were in the Mississippi Delta.
[00:05:20] Was he still in the army? No, I think he just got out. And then what was what he
[00:05:25] did want to get out of the army? He was a he was pretty much like Bill Murray. He was a groundskeeper
[00:05:32] for a golf course while he went to college after getting out of nom. You know, came back and
[00:05:38] really was like, he was like a hundred percent like freaking scope and out gofers and wait,
[00:05:44] this is Caddy Shack Bill Murray. Yeah, we are always. Okay. Yeah, I remember I remember like
[00:05:51] being with him in that golf cart cruising around and he went to and this is stuff I haven't
[00:05:58] even talked to him about. This is just from memory from that long ago, but I'm sure he went to
[00:06:02] Delta State and Cleveland, Mississippi. My mom worked for Baxter Health Care and that's why I
[00:06:08] think we were there and so my dad went to college for psychology and you know, I remember
[00:06:16] plug-in, and learn into plug holes on the golf greens and smoke in that first ball washer with
[00:06:23] the golf cart when I was, I don't even know how old I was. I just know like, you know, my dad
[00:06:28] being like, bring that golf cart over here and it was in reverse. I just stomped on and just drove over
[00:06:33] the ball washer. Yeah, the first time karma made a little. That's the first time karma saw me
[00:06:37] going away the second and retracting on this nerd. Yeah, I mean, I wonder what my dad would think,
[00:06:43] you know, damn, is that a sign? That would have been a real easy one to get to get over. Yeah,
[00:06:51] because it just, I was a tornado for a while. Wait, so where'd you do like the bulk of your,
[00:07:00] like when you were in, let's say like six, seven to eight, when you start actually, you know,
[00:07:04] figuring out the world and all that, where are you then? It would have been Illinois. We were in the
[00:07:12] Delta until I was seven, I think, and then my mom got transferred up to Northern Illinois
[00:07:18] to work for Baxter and that's kind of where I grew up. And when I came up there, honestly, I was
[00:07:27] a little bit rebellious. Not really sure why. I just, I don't know, it's just what I was into,
[00:07:34] like I was a skater and honestly, there was, I enjoy skating, I enjoyed like freaking ninja movies
[00:07:43] and so I, like, I built ramps and you know, and people and I was just like a punk and Northern
[00:07:52] Illinois, that, you know, when, when everything was like skater died and there was, you know, all these,
[00:07:57] like anti-scape things, that was me. So yeah, school, you know, there was definitely a little bit of,
[00:08:06] you know, hate towards skating then and I wasn't like, I had no drive athletically. I was just
[00:08:15] wanting to like pierce my ears, like play with fireworks, you know, blow stuff up.
[00:08:25] I think it's around. This is how old built.
[00:08:27] Eight to 13, it was just like, you know, my first construction job I said was building ramps.
[00:08:37] I mean, I had ramps all over the place. My sister freaking hated them. How good? How good
[00:08:43] it's skating where you? I would say I was just below intermediate.
[00:08:51] Is it something where you, how many hours a day were you skating? Like a lot. Yeah, I had
[00:08:59] half by, of course, what's up with the stellar level of just below intermediate? Because I
[00:09:05] the only instruction I had was watching the search for animal chin freaking every day, like
[00:09:11] in a big box of cereal and then go out and just try to get after it. So what, at what point
[00:09:17] or what was it that made you start doing athletics sports? You teen me up for this? So
[00:09:26] I think I was doing some weird stuff. Yeah, because my dad was, I always knew my dad was a
[00:09:31] super athlete. You know, he was my uncle and me on my mom always told me how athletic my dad was.
[00:09:39] And not to mention, he was just good at, you know, anything like, honestly even the skateboard,
[00:09:47] he's just like, what's that? And I learned to skate on this half pipe and he's just like,
[00:09:51] oh, let me check it out and then he just do it. You're just over your drive. He had a ball of
[00:09:56] all. But no, I like I said, I liked fireworks and like, you know, blowing stuff up and, you know,
[00:10:09] one thing led to another and freaking burn my house down at 10 years old.
[00:10:14] It's over 11 maybe 11. Maybe 11. Literally. Yeah. Yeah. Everything except for what was in my
[00:10:21] dad's car while he was at work and what was in my mom's car while she was, I think in Puerto Rico
[00:10:26] on a business trip. How old were you? I think I was like 11 or 12. How did it happen?
[00:10:32] Playing with fire, freaking lit some stuff on my bed on fire and then like put it out,
[00:10:39] called my dad and my dad, you know, he's like, do you get it out? I said, yeah, I got it out and he
[00:10:44] goes, is there smoke in the house? I go, oh yeah, there's freaking tons of smoke and he's like,
[00:10:49] open up all the windows. He said, you know, he's like, I hate the smell smoke. You know, get that
[00:10:53] shit out of there. So I opened up everything and he's like, go open up the windows and everything
[00:10:58] come back and tell me what's going on. So I came back to the phone. I'm like, I open up everything.
[00:11:02] It's smoke in, but smoke's going out. So he talked to me for a little bit and then he said,
[00:11:09] we'll go check on it, go back down and check on it and I went down when I went down. It was like
[00:11:13] in golf because I just gave it oxygen. You know, I didn't, like, if I would have just, like,
[00:11:20] taken that blanket and like, you know, if he would have just said, go throw that blanket out in the
[00:11:24] yard, like, game over. But, you know, I put it out and then freaking fueled, like, open the front door,
[00:11:32] open the window and just freaking gave that thing. What were you burning? Like, like, matchsticks,
[00:11:37] were you burning like what? I think I was just playing flame thrower with a lighter and some
[00:11:42] aqua net that has just been mad. And so, so the whole house burns down. Oh yeah, everything.
[00:11:54] Yeah, everything. And so it was, I mean, I don't really know what kind of conversation my parents had
[00:12:02] because they never, they kind of asked what happened or something, you know, but they never,
[00:12:10] like, made me feel horrible about it. And then they just let, I mean, you must have felt like freaking
[00:12:17] horrible though. Oh, still do. I mean, I laugh about it now. But yeah, like, I think about, you know,
[00:12:23] because like, all my dads, you know, all my dad's military stuff, like, every picture he had from,
[00:12:30] you know, as a child, you know, everything we had, every single thing. I remember it was in the
[00:12:37] winner. So everything like froze, like after they put it out. And I remember digging through it with
[00:12:43] my dad, you know, we were like digging through the thing, like a couple days later, just trying to
[00:12:48] see what you can find. And I remember we like, we were digging and found this, like, closet that was
[00:12:54] in right inside our front door and it like fallen through and the, like, the glass doors were there.
[00:13:00] And I remember my dad, you know, shuck in the glass doors open and he had a pair of these, like,
[00:13:05] lacrosse, winner boots and they looked a brand new and I'll never forget how excited. He's just like,
[00:13:12] my boots, man. Be freaking grabbed him. He's just like, my boots are okay. And I remember, like,
[00:13:18] that was it. Like, other than what he had in his, the trunk of his car and what he wore to that
[00:13:23] day, like that was it. So then we, you know, started to rebuild naturally. I was a skater and not to mention
[00:13:36] 10 years old. I was five foot, 130 pounds. So I was like short and fat, you know, short and
[00:13:45] chubby. And so, you know, short and chubby skater, you know, wasn't an athlete. So then, you know, my dad could tell
[00:13:53] I was, I was bummed out, you know. And so he kept telling me, like, you need to go, just go do something,
[00:14:00] you know, just, you know, go get active, hang out with your friends, like, you know, he wasn't
[00:14:04] want me to like sit around and get depressed about it. So they talked me into going out to, like,
[00:14:09] a school dancer or something. You know, this is whatever fifth grade or something. I remember going
[00:14:15] and they said, like, this, hey, the songs dedicated to John Dudley and it was burning down the house.
[00:14:23] So I wanted to put on a kid's drink. Some jocco over there said that one, my one.
[00:14:31] That's, I was, fortunately, that's exactly what, that's exactly my mode. What I was a kid to be a
[00:14:37] little freaking savage. Yeah. So then that's amazing. That your parents recognized that you felt
[00:14:46] enough guilt on your own without having to just turn the screws on your brain to make you feel even
[00:14:52] worse about it. Yeah. I don't know if I could have done it. Like, I don't know. I don't know what
[00:14:56] the conversation was. They've never brought it up. And there's been times where we've talked about
[00:15:01] the fire. It's kind of how it's referred to. But they've never gone into detail. Like, my dad's
[00:15:07] never said, like, yeah, man, I knew if I freaking threw that shit on you, you know, it cracked you or
[00:15:12] whatever. But what happened was, you know, and me, oh, maybe this is just my dad psychology. But
[00:15:20] what happened was after that dance, my dad knew, like, we need to get this guy out of this town.
[00:15:27] So we moved about 45 minutes away. And without him ever telling like, saying anything to me,
[00:15:34] I knew when I moved. Like, I need, I need to freaking make it right with my dad. So that's when
[00:15:43] I went and started. But I'm just like, you know, he's, I know he's always wanted to be me to be an athlete.
[00:15:50] So like, I need to get my shit together and start getting into sports. And this is how, how will
[00:15:55] you? I think I was, because you keep saying like 10 12 10 12. Well, there's a bigger thing.
[00:16:00] 10 10 10 10. Yeah, I think the, I think the fire was when I was 10. And then we probably moved when I was 11.
[00:16:09] Yeah, because then by when I got into junior high school, that's when I'm like, I'm going to be an athlete.
[00:16:15] What did it start with? What was the first sport? Basketball.
[00:16:20] Um, well, yeah, I think basketball football. There's all in. Yeah. Basketball football running. And then,
[00:16:30] you know, there was, I knew you had no experience playing basketball. That's it.
[00:16:35] My dad always shot hoops. That's what I mean. It's not a little bit of a little bit. Yeah, a little bit.
[00:16:39] But then I started growing. So I was like, I remember at 10, I've got this football card.
[00:16:45] And it says like, it has your stats on the back. And I think my grandma gave me that photo,
[00:16:51] because we didn't have any pictures, you know, going back pre-fire. So I was like 5 foot 130 pounds.
[00:16:58] And I was like, Chubby. Then when I was a freshman, so what is that 13 12 12 13 13 year
[00:17:07] freshman I think? So then on that, on that one, I was 6 330. And then by the time I was senior, I was 65
[00:17:16] 205. So I just like stretched out and just looked like this gumby going up and down the basketball
[00:17:26] court, you know, my dad's like, I always felt like if you tripped it sound like a chandelier break
[00:17:31] and a crossing. How much would you practice like, okay, so you get into basketball, the
[00:17:38] you start saying, because I mean, that's that's a for you to make a transition from like, hey,
[00:17:42] I'm a skater with freaking whatever you probably had like the Tony Hawk bangs and stuff like this.
[00:17:49] Hell yeah. So you had the Tony Hawk bangs. Then you're like, all right, maybe a basketball player.
[00:17:54] You get a crew cut. You start freaking training. Is it like that kind of, we talking rocky?
[00:17:59] What's that thing called montage? Is there a montage going on? No, not really, because I still,
[00:18:05] I mean, I still liked, you know, getting in trouble and freaking blowing stuff up and, you know,
[00:18:14] order and fireworks wherever I could or egg in some houses or, you know, whatever kind of this
[00:18:21] shift. I stole my mom's minivan one time. She had this, she had this Pontiac transport.
[00:18:28] You remember those ones? It was like a wedge. It just sloped. Yeah, because eventually my parents got
[00:18:34] divorced and I can't remember when it was. It was somewhere, you know, junior high or something like that.
[00:18:39] But my mom traveled a lot and I was home on my own a lot. And so I remember, you know, my mom would
[00:18:48] have like cars take her to O'Hare. And so I remember one time, like, I'm just going to go take that
[00:18:55] van out for rip, you know, like, all the ball washers in, you know, all the email and all I
[00:19:01] would do is I'm driving by. Yeah. So I'm driving around, you know, seventh grade, just driving around
[00:19:08] my town and this minivan and one of my buddies was on his bike like driving out the road.
[00:19:14] So I pull over and I'm like, what's up, man? He's just like, holy shit. Did you steal a car?
[00:19:20] I'm like, yeah, it's my mom. And he's just like, and, you know, and I thought I could drive pretty
[00:19:26] decent because I had my dad would never let me get like motorcycle or anything for obvious reasons.
[00:19:33] But he let me get a boat. He got me a 12 foot boss and wailer with a 25 horse on it.
[00:19:39] Okay. So that's like, I put a thousand miles on that freaking thing, dude. I mean, my dad would
[00:19:46] fill up that little five-gann, five-gann gas can and the Fox River chain was only a block from
[00:19:54] my house. We live like right on a channel. So I just drove that boat all the time. So to me, the minivan
[00:20:00] was gravy, right? No current. You know, didn't have trim til, like this was, it wasn't a pull start.
[00:20:09] This was freaking gravy. But I'm sitting there talking to this, this kid and I see someone coming
[00:20:17] up behind me in the mirror. So I said, I go, hold on. I'll let me freaking with over, you know,
[00:20:21] and I've been written reverse and trying to like do a little, you know, whip in. But that long
[00:20:28] beak on the front of that freaking minivan, I ended up swiping this dudes like back pegs and like
[00:20:34] took him out underneath like the front of the car and like bent the back of his bike up a lot.
[00:20:40] So then I ended up having a, you know, trade him like my good bike at a GT, you know, I had to trade
[00:20:46] him like a good freaking, it was good bike for a huffie. Yeah, for this freaking huffie that he had.
[00:20:52] And and I'm just like, you're not going to say nothing. He said no, but, you know, looking back,
[00:20:57] you know, if any of our kids rolled in with a brand new freaking GT, you know, with the gyro on it,
[00:21:05] freaking pegs on the front back, you'd be like, hey, who's bike did you steal? So anyway, you know,
[00:21:12] fast for today, I'm knocked out. Always. Holy crap. The kid broke bro. He broke big time.
[00:21:20] The desk went out to go to a blind. They could, they could, they could be at me.
[00:21:24] drove home in the car. Yeah, it was just, you know, stuff like that. Yeah, Ben, you hear like, wait,
[00:21:30] job, dubbie, dad. Little kid was driving his mom's car. I'm going over to the right now. Yeah.
[00:21:36] I don't think anyone wanted to get close because, yeah, I mean, I had, I had freaking
[00:21:42] straight bangs down here, slung it. And yeah, just, I think, I think when I got into sport,
[00:21:51] they're, and originally, I didn't want to really play football. I was supposed to play golf.
[00:21:57] Like, my dad said, don't play football. You're not, you know, you're too brittle. Go play golf.
[00:22:03] And when I went to the high school, like the tough kid in school came up to me and goes,
[00:22:09] hey, what are you going out for? Because I was standing in the line. And he said, I go,
[00:22:14] I'm going out for golf. He's like, no, you're going out for football. And I said, no, I'm going out for
[00:22:18] golf. I have to do golf. And I remember he said, well, we need enough guys to scrimmage. And he said,
[00:22:25] you know, I'm quarterback. So he's like, you're signing up for football or I'm going to beat your
[00:22:31] ass. So I freaking signed up for football. I'm never told my dad for, like,
[00:22:36] until he saw me in the paper. What do you, what do you see in the paper for? Well, because I ended
[00:22:41] up becoming quarterback and like, taking that kid's job. So how was he was saying, I would take my golf
[00:22:47] clubs to school? Because I'd say like, he's like, how's golf? And I'm, it's all right.
[00:22:54] But I was playing football because I kind of had to. And I started out as like defensive in and then
[00:23:00] tight end. And then I think I like chucked a football back. You know, I think I caught a pass and like
[00:23:06] went in the end zone. And then the coach was like, hey, throw the ball back. And I think I just freaking
[00:23:12] just hooked it. And he just like, whoa, you know, wait a minute. So he had just one thing led to another.
[00:23:18] And just I think I think I loved, I don't know, just the concept challenge. It's hard to
[00:23:29] describe. But it's like, if I know I'm not good at something, which I really had never fueled that,
[00:23:36] then it didn't keep me coming. Like, I'd get bored with it. But if I, if I wasn't good at it,
[00:23:43] or if I knew that I had room for improvement, then that's the things that I progressed at. But it just
[00:23:49] kind of got to the point where no matter really what the sport was, I felt like I could do it above
[00:23:54] average. And then I honestly like my body started to change. So it went from like me being like the
[00:24:02] short fat skater to now I'm, you know, second tallest kid in the school and growing and, you know,
[00:24:11] becoming an asshole, you know, just kind of being, you're just growing up just being like overly
[00:24:17] confident, you know. But I felt, I just felt so much confidence. It was like gas. Just sports for me.
[00:24:26] Was just gas. Because it's like, oh, you want to do track? Okay, go do track. What did you do in
[00:24:32] track? Um, high jump, triple jump. Whatever I wanted. Honestly, 100, 200, 400 and you just go to the
[00:24:43] all of them. Yeah, I mean, I did for my team. Yeah, I did good. Did you, did the coaches like try and keep
[00:24:50] you focused on one thing? I think, yeah, like the idea that some people have that the best thing to
[00:24:57] do with their kid is put them in one sport when they're four years old. Yeah, that's keep them
[00:25:00] focused on. And then other people are like, hey, have your kids play a bunch of different sports
[00:25:06] and it's going to make them more well rounded in the end. Well, it's, in a way, you look at it like
[00:25:12] functional fitness now. It's proven that, you know, if I would have had more functional fitness
[00:25:18] in my lifestyle, I would be feeling a little bit better today than I did pre-surf. You know,
[00:25:25] for the first time with you, um, because like some of my stuff is smoked, probably because it's not
[00:25:30] like functional fitness. And I'm, I'm a, you know, I feel like the reason I still today do good.
[00:25:37] It just random things I pick up is because, you know, when you do different sports, you also get
[00:25:43] street smarts in athletics. You know, that's the thing, like there's booksmart people and then
[00:25:48] there's street smarts people. And as like an employer, I, you know, I'm not, I don't look for
[00:25:55] degree. I look for work ethic. And I look for someone that, you know, when they pull up and I look
[00:26:02] in their car, it's not a freaking wreck. It's not trashed, you know, and I look for people that have
[00:26:09] certain types of work ethic qualities. Because for me, as an athlete, I feel like, even though I wasn't
[00:26:16] like the pinnacle of all these different sports, I also learned different mechanics and different, like,
[00:26:23] you know, physical smarts from doing a lot of things. And I always, I always wanted to do good enough
[00:26:32] at it to where I felt like I could put it down and pick it up and still like represent it. Well,
[00:26:39] you know, if I felt like I, if I did it and looked like an idiot in front of people, I'd want to do it
[00:26:44] more until I could get it figured out. But my son, you know, coming from England, he was in the soccer
[00:26:52] first. So he came over and, you know, he played soccer quite a bit, but over here, soccer is like a
[00:26:57] one season thing. So once he got into junior high, you know, he tried football and I realized that just
[00:27:04] wasn't this thing, you know, it just wasn't, you know, getting hit and stuff, just wasn't this thing.
[00:27:11] But he was like always fast, you know, he's always fast and, and he likes, I mean, he
[00:27:18] performs at his highest if especially when he knows someone's pumped about the fact that he just did good.
[00:27:27] So I ended up talking him into swimming because he did, let's see, he did soccer. I knew soccer
[00:27:36] was coming up. We talked him into cross country and he didn't really like the people.
[00:27:40] Love the coach, awesome coach. And then I talked him into going into swimming, winning the
[00:27:45] swimming, had a freaking awesome instructor, military dude, super disciplined, slam like, honestly
[00:27:54] for how young he was. I was like, okay, these guys are crazy two days. Like, Charms getting up at
[00:28:00] 430, having him to the pool at 515, they do an hour practice and then shower and then she'd get
[00:28:10] him home to feed him before we take him to junior, you know, whatever high school or whatever. So he had a
[00:28:16] pretty like awesome schedule, I thought, you know, I'm like this guy and he was getting straight
[00:28:22] days, which I don't ever remember taking a book home. Like, I don't even remember being a sign
[00:28:29] books. Yeah, part of it was different, I didn't wrong. It was different back then. I mean, like, I didn't
[00:28:35] do, like, I see my kids, my kids will have, and they're older now, but when they were in school,
[00:28:40] it was like homework every day from day one from like kindergarten on through high school, hours and
[00:28:47] hours and hours, the homework. I never did homework. Homework was not a thing. And I, I,
[00:28:54] wait, now let me refresh that. It was a thing. It did exist. I knew that it was a thing in
[00:28:59] existence, but it wasn't a thing that I was doing right? It wasn't like, oh, it's, you know, it's
[00:29:04] the afternoon. I'm gonna do homework now. It was like the afternoon. I'm going to throw rocks at
[00:29:08] shit. I guess that was, that was where I was at. So what, what sports did you end up playing?
[00:29:15] Because I know, like you rattle off one time to me, you're like, oh, I did freaking wrestling. I did
[00:29:19] basketball, I did football, I did baseball, I did tennis, I did freaking, you did everything.
[00:29:23] Yeah. Well, you just named them all. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I did, I did quite a bit. I wrestled a year
[00:29:32] mainly because I did basketball, really didn't like the coach. And just, I'm like, I freaking hate
[00:29:39] this guy. So then I went and wrestled and coming into wrestling as a sophomore, and we had a really
[00:29:46] good wrestling school too. Like both the Guidas are from. That's right. Yeah, you saw me that.
[00:29:52] Yeah. So like Jason was my guard and Clay was a little bit younger, but, you know, we had a
[00:29:59] fire up was Clay Guida when he was 14. Dude, dude, dude, he's 30 whatever right now. He's still
[00:30:05] fired. Let me just tell you Clay, well, Jason was Jason was like on a clay level, but like more,
[00:30:15] like more of a gorilla, you know, Clay gives Jason a lot of credit for being a savage and trust me.
[00:30:22] He was every game. He like, before every game, he'd take a mouthpiece out of a packet and we'd
[00:30:30] put it on his helmet and then he was like my pulling guard. And I remember like, by fourth quarter,
[00:30:38] I'd be like grabbing his mask. I'd normally like grab his face mask to like call plays.
[00:30:44] And I'd look and it would just be like the plastic piece like because he would chew just
[00:30:50] be eating like a human. He would eat a whole mouthpiece and his eyeballs were like this big around.
[00:30:56] Yeah, this is Jason or Clay. Jason, yeah, Jason. And I remember, I remember one time, like him and
[00:31:05] him and his brother lived in a part of town that was like, you know, um, I don't know, there's a
[00:31:14] lot of savages over that way. You know, there's like a lot of like wrestlers came from that group
[00:31:19] town. There's a lot of bad asses over there. And I remember one time like Jason came to practice
[00:31:26] and he was kind of pissed because he was like chainsawing something on his garage and the chainsaw
[00:31:32] kicked back and hit him in the top of the head and like chainsawed his head open and dude,
[00:31:38] he just threw his football helmet on and freaking got after it. Dude, like that right there.
[00:31:45] I was just on a on Jason and I wrestled the same the same weight class, which was what I think
[00:31:53] 171 in our sophomore year, but he was like way better. I was just on Jordan Peterson's podcast
[00:32:01] a little while ago and he was like talking to me and I was like talking about how like when you're
[00:32:04] a young kid and that's not everybody, but you just want to like fight and go and that's my
[00:32:11] picture when you picture him just knowing a part of this freaking mouthpiece and his eyes are all big.
[00:32:16] This kid needs to go to combat somewhere like that's what he's meant to do.
[00:32:20] And he did. And he did. So you wrestled for a year?
[00:32:26] Yeah, wrestled for a year. But it's good to look. I'm okay. How good of an athlete you are?
[00:32:29] You roll into wrestling and did you not just get like crushed? Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:37] You can't catch up. You know, I wrestled. Yeah. I wrestled JV and I mean they were that we were a wrestling
[00:32:46] school. Like, you know, we had we had some really good wrestling coaches and
[00:32:53] me. Yeah, it was tough. It was tough. But I really I was still like getting into my body honestly
[00:33:00] at because I stretched up so high. And so I didn't have a lot of coordination. But I had work ethic.
[00:33:06] You know, that's one of the things before like before I go down that route like with
[00:33:11] multi-sport thing with my son. He did swimming after cross country and then when he got to soccer.
[00:33:19] Like he started the coach wasn't playing it. But at practice this this coach was taken weeks to
[00:33:26] try to condition the other player. But here he'd be out there just running circles around people
[00:33:32] because he just got off of cross country followed by swim season followed by now at soccer season.
[00:33:38] You're just running around on some grass. You know, so he for him it was nothing and I I remember
[00:33:45] after like three or four games of watching the coach just bypass him. I kind of pulled the
[00:33:51] coach to the side after practice and I said, hey, I said, is there anything I should be working
[00:33:56] with Harry on so he can get more game time? And he just said, well, I don't like single player.
[00:34:05] You know, he said, I want soccer players. Harry's too distracted with other sports.
[00:34:12] And I was just like, really, you know, I said, I'd deal with a lot of coaches
[00:34:20] on pretty high levels. And I said, I've never known a coach to not want an athlete on the team.
[00:34:31] I'm like, this this kids and athlete and athlete as opposed to a sport specific.
[00:34:37] Yeah, I'm trick going triponi. Yeah. And so yeah, right then I just kind of told Harry, like,
[00:34:44] I don't think soccer's your thing. So he went into track and, you know, did cross country track and
[00:34:52] slam four years, even though he didn't like it, you know, still did it. And then, you know,
[00:34:57] ended up going to college to run and and still gets awesome grades and runs and does all that stuff.
[00:35:03] And he's kind of like like I was, but a little bit later, he's like now getting into his
[00:35:09] into his body to where Andy's also hit a new gear of competitiveness, which is really cool to see,
[00:35:17] because I hit that way earlier, you know, I would get probably what held me back athletically as I
[00:35:23] would get really pissed off. You know, it's like once I started to compete, I hadn't ever been taught
[00:35:30] the management of like, you know, raging out when you, like made a bad play or through an
[00:35:36] interception or something. And that that actually transpired all the way into my archery career and then
[00:35:41] luckily um, an Olympic coach like helped that. That was a big turning point in my career like in my
[00:35:48] 20s when I got taught like how to get, you know, how to not let the arrows in my quiver that haven't been
[00:35:55] shot yet be affected by the ones that already have and that you can't get back, you know, that's kind of how
[00:36:01] it was put to me. So that really helped, but in high school, I think by the time I hit, you know,
[00:36:09] junior and senior year, I just started to, I just started to feel way more confident in what I was doing
[00:36:15] and, you know, size wise, you know, I was a totally different person than what I was.
[00:36:23] So what ended up being like the sport football for sure? Yeah, football was was the sport and for me,
[00:36:31] I've always struggled with sleep, you know, I've always just, you know, been in and saw him the
[00:36:37] act. And I also, one of the things that kept me awake was knowing if someone else was like
[00:36:44] having more time to train than me. So, you know, I was welcomed by world. Yeah, so I was like in high school
[00:36:53] by my senior year, you know, I was like substituting any non-elective class that I had or all my
[00:36:59] study halls for like, extra gym. So I'd go to like 4 gym classes and then I had my, my football coach gave
[00:37:07] me a key to the gymnasium. So when I couldn't sleep at night and my mom would be gone, you know,
[00:37:15] I was home, I was home alone a lot, you know, I had my mom would just sign a checkbook for me to like
[00:37:21] order Domino's, you know. And whenever I woke up, I'd go to the high school, go in there and I had,
[00:37:28] you know, my coach gave me this huge bag of footballs when I was a sophomore and just said like
[00:37:33] these are years until you graduate. And so I'd just go to the gym and I'd pull the laundry baskets,
[00:37:39] you know, out of the locker rooms. And I'd just throw, you know, from corner to the gym to corner the
[00:37:45] gym, I'd just run like three step drills and just like run 73 passes into those or then into garbage
[00:37:53] cans or then eventually just like throwing into the basketball hoop and then just doing like three
[00:37:58] step drops, five step drops, seven step drops, roll outs and just and then I got to the point where
[00:38:03] it's like I memorized what I needed to do but then I memorized what the line we need to do and then
[00:38:08] you know, like every player on the field, it's like this is, you know, I knew the playbook front and back.
[00:38:14] How good would you say? So, how do you guys do senior year? Horrible, you know, just really
[00:38:22] underperformed at all the camps, we were awesome because it camps. How should you have done?
[00:38:29] I mean, were you from like a week school, a week football school? No. You're from a good football
[00:38:33] school and you guys were just playing shitty. No, you know, it's kind of like, it's kind of like when
[00:38:41] you, I forget what podcasts it was or maybe it's in your book when you were talking about
[00:38:46] three buds, there were the two teams of the two different boats. You know, I remember like one of the
[00:38:53] saying, my football coach always would have, he'd be like, you know, bring the boat in, you know,
[00:38:58] he always would say like the boats lost, he's like a geor job to bring the boat in, you know,
[00:39:03] and he was like, you're job-meaning you, yeah, because you're the quarterback. Yeah, I was responsible
[00:39:09] for every mistake we made. You know, if we screwed around and practiced to get shut off early,
[00:39:14] he would, he would like pull me back and tell me like, you're going to run laps for
[00:39:20] every person here that screwed off today and today there was, you know, we freaking,
[00:39:25] 46 minutes early, we quit practice. I want 46 laps, you know, it'd be like stuff like that.
[00:39:31] But we had a small group of people for like seven on seven camps that were at all the, they were
[00:39:37] at all the camps. They, I would call them and say, let's go practice. But there was, and we, at seven
[00:39:45] on seven, we were great. But there was, you know, four other people that weren't being included,
[00:39:53] and then the entire defense. So we were just, we had really good pieces, but nothing ever, like
[00:40:02] flowed as a team. Did you, did you do good enough? Did you get looked at by colleges?
[00:40:07] Yeah, I think the first college, I think the first college that looked at me was ball state when I was
[00:40:13] a sophomore. I remember at the end of my sophomore year, I went to ball state with my mom,
[00:40:17] and that was like that litter totally different fire, because then I realized like, you know,
[00:40:23] I'm going to go somewhere. And so, you know, my dad, even though my parents were split,
[00:40:32] my dad was at every freaking game. And he was quite a ways, you know, he kind of moved to a different
[00:40:37] town. But he came to every game. And yeah, I mean, my life was sport,
[00:40:45] sport, and training. I mean, I loved lifting, I camped in the summertime. It was every football
[00:40:53] camp I could sign up for. And honestly, my mom's like, you know, she was so, you know, involved with
[00:41:01] her position at backster to where she's like, yeah, if you want to, you know, go somewhere for
[00:41:07] a month in the summer, do it, you know, because I think she probably just, you know, was
[00:41:11] managing plants and Puerto Rico or Singapore or wherever the heck, you know, she was for her
[00:41:17] job. So, I just, I did not miss an opportunity to like go to a camp or something like that.
[00:41:25] So did you actually get recruited to go in your senior year to go to college?
[00:41:28] Yeah, yeah, there was several. And I ended up choosing, I wanted to go back. My dad was moving
[00:41:35] back to North Carolina. My uncle was in North Carolina. And one of the coaches at Western Carolina
[00:41:44] played with my dad and, you know, we ended up going out there. And it was kind of a decision that I
[00:41:52] would be close to the Dudley family, out that way. And I liked the idea of like getting,
[00:41:58] honestly, I never really felt like that town was home, you know, and maybe it's because, like,
[00:42:06] you know, my parents were kind of always split. I saw my mom limited, you know, when she wasn't
[00:42:12] traveling. But we, like, we traveled away from like me and my mom were together more when we go
[00:42:18] places. Because she'd say, hey, you know, I've got a, I've got a meeting in Salt Lake for two days.
[00:42:24] Do you want to come with me? And I'd say, oh, can I go to, I've been wanting to check out snowbird.
[00:42:29] And she's just like, yeah, you know, so we'd fly out there. And she'd say, the bus will pick you up in
[00:42:34] the morning and seven and they'll bring you back to, you know, just make sure you're back here.
[00:42:38] This time, so I just go up and then I started, you know, skiing, shred and love skiing,
[00:42:45] worked at a little ski hill up there and skied bumps, like all the time in the, in the winter time.
[00:42:52] And it's cool. So then what happened with college then? So I was going to play football. And
[00:43:02] like the one thing that I haven't talked about was back at age 10 when I was a super punk.
[00:43:11] My uncle and my grandfather got me into like hunting deer when we'd go down to Mississippi.
[00:43:18] We'd go back down there to see family for Thanksgiving. And so, you know, they were like,
[00:43:23] you know, we need to get you out in the woods. And my grandpa was all, you know, creating more
[00:43:28] veteran. And he's like, you know, we need to make a man of you because I'm showing up with freaking
[00:43:34] Tony Hawk haircut and freaking earrings and, you know, stuff like stuff like that. So he's out there,
[00:43:41] you know, making me sit and firing at beds and, you know, just trying to like make a man out of this
[00:43:47] freaking softy that's coming down. And so, you know, like I got into hunting and just loved it.
[00:43:55] Like it was, and honestly, probably because it was hard. And it like took a ton of patience and
[00:44:03] it was very different from being able to just screw off, you know. And so it was, it was the first
[00:44:10] kind of form of competition in a way, just that it took a lot of moving parts to be successful.
[00:44:17] So, you know, when I got my first deer, it was like winning my first trophy, right? I mean,
[00:44:23] I was totally hooked at how freaking awesome it was. And just seeing my family, like, oh my gosh,
[00:44:29] you got a deer, then we ate it and everything, you know, and it was just this thing. So every
[00:44:34] year for Thanksgiving, I was looking forward to going back home and doing that. And I got into bow hunting.
[00:44:39] I think when I was the first year, I hunted with, they gave me, I had a gun and then
[00:44:44] when I was 10, is when I started shooting a bow and bow hunting. So that was once a year, that was
[00:44:54] happening. But then I got a little bit better towards the end of my senior year. I was shooting a
[00:45:01] lot more around home, like I was practicing and stuff a lot because again, I had a lot of free time.
[00:45:07] You know, my mom would be gone. You had no homework. Yeah. No homework. If I wasn't like
[00:45:14] cutting grass, like, you know, through five bucks a long, then that's what I was doing. But I ended up
[00:45:23] driving down this road. I actually had to hurt my knee. So I was, I was, I moved in a college a
[00:45:28] little bit early. And hurt my knee. And then I forget what happened. But I was at home, back by my
[00:45:38] mom's for some reason. I was just driving around on this like a back road. And I think I was coming,
[00:45:45] I think I went to college. Yeah, I was moved in. I moved in and I'm talking like, there a week,
[00:45:52] maybe a week and a half. And you can hurt your knee at some point. Yeah. It's not really able to play.
[00:45:59] Yeah. I thought whatever reason you go back home. Yeah. We did some, we did some like run throughs.
[00:46:04] I know I did some stuff with like, you know, I remember wearing like pants, jersey helmet,
[00:46:10] you know, just doing like dry runs and stuff. But I wasn't, I don't, I never like hit really hit
[00:46:17] helmets, you know, in college. And so as the weekend, I went back and saw my mom. And then I drove,
[00:46:25] I think I went up to the ski hill just to, you know, go up there and say how to people that
[00:46:29] worked up in the summer. And on my way back, I took some back roads back home. And I went by this
[00:46:35] little town called Ringwood. And I saw this sign on the, on the side of the road that just said,
[00:46:41] archery shoot like spray painted on a board and just had an arrow like pointing that way.
[00:46:48] So I went down that road and I'm like, what's this all about, you know,
[00:46:52] yeah, I had my heart. I went down this road. Yes, you did. Yeah. Yes, you did.
[00:46:56] Well, went down the road. And I said, what's this all about? And they're like, oh, we got a, you know,
[00:47:02] 40 target course. And you know, here's how the scoring works on the animal, you know, 3D animal
[00:47:07] targets. I had never seen 3D animal targets. I'd always like shot it, bail's a hay and stuff like that.
[00:47:14] So I went out and freaking halfway through the course. I was out of arrows. I had freaking
[00:47:23] shot the woods down. And I remember leaving the course got my car went back up to Wilmont,
[00:47:31] Wisconsin, which was where the ski hill was, but there's also a Gander Mountain outlet store there,
[00:47:37] went in and bought more arrows like in a rage and went back to finish. Because I didn't want to
[00:47:44] not finish the course. So I bought more arrows to go back to finish by the time I'd like finished
[00:47:49] everything was pretty much done. And they were having the award ceremony and the guys that were
[00:47:55] up on that podium all had these shirts that had like their local shop on the shirt. So I remember
[00:48:03] this was on a Sunday and on Monday morning, like when they, I think they opened it one o'clock,
[00:48:10] but at one o'clock, I was at that shop. Just like, when are those guys coming in that, you know,
[00:48:16] one this weekend and I just started staying in there and watching these people shoot and ask
[00:48:23] questions and I was there a few days just kind of being a stalker. And the owner of the archery shop
[00:48:34] called me to the side said, hey kid, what are you, what are you doing? I said, I'm just, I'm watching.
[00:48:38] I'm watching. And he said, well, come in the back room. I need you for a minute. He took me in the
[00:48:44] back room and he said, I forgot to get this guy's arrows done. He goes to be overbuilt arrows and
[00:48:49] I said, no, sir. He goes, okay, well, here's how you do it. And he said, you know, you're going to
[00:48:56] clean this feather like this. Then you're going to put the glue on it. You put it in this clamp and
[00:49:01] then you stick it down. And he's like, you know, set this timer and then move on to this next jig
[00:49:06] and do a second arrow. And then when you get to the six, you can go back to the first. If the
[00:49:10] timer's gone off, you rotate it. And so I just sat in this room and flesh this guy's arrows.
[00:49:17] And then kind of came out and said, like, I got off, you know. So he came out and gave the guy's arrows.
[00:49:26] The guy just said, all right, do those ones. And he had just this buckets of arrows that
[00:49:33] needed to get done. So I just started flesh and arrows. And then the next day's like,
[00:49:37] give you ever worked on a bow and I said, no, I haven't. And he's like, all right, well, let me show you
[00:49:41] how to change a string and, you know, and then he's like, hey, if you know, if these bows are here
[00:49:46] for maintenance, you know, here's the checklist. You got to, you know, clean these axles. You got a wax
[00:49:51] is stringing and melted in with this and just started showing me. And honestly, after probably
[00:49:58] two weeks of doing that, I ended up telling the guy, I said, hey, am I going to get a page
[00:50:06] change? And he's just like, I remember the guy's name was Mike Donovan, some people in the
[00:50:13] archery industry, like old timers. They still remember him because he was a pretty hard core
[00:50:19] archery manager at the time. But he goes, you can't put value on what I'm teaching you right now.
[00:50:25] I remember, I'm like, no sir, you can't, but I can't put gas in my tank, you know, with experience.
[00:50:32] So he, he's like, I'll give you a four, 10 an hour and I'm just like, oh, yeah, you know, I was
[00:50:39] freaking pumped. And I remember going home to my dad and I went to my dad's a North Carolina
[00:50:47] or what? Well, my dad at that time, I think was, yeah, he was still in Rockford, Illinois. And I
[00:50:53] remember telling my dad, hey, I'm not going to go to college to play ball because I've, you know,
[00:51:05] I've got this archery thing going and it's, it's because it's good. He's like, you know, like,
[00:51:11] that four, 10 an hour I did. Because I remember, you know, again, he's always been super logical
[00:51:18] and he's also like tried to not, he never really told me like, at that point he had never said like,
[00:51:25] what's wrong with you or, you know, that's a terrible decision. But in that instance, he's like,
[00:51:31] I, I really feel like you need to make your own decisions and you need to know like what to do.
[00:51:38] He said, but I have to say, I think this is a terrible decision.
[00:51:45] And I think for my 40th birthday, he wrote me this really long birthday card in like, in there,
[00:51:52] he said he's like, you could have not done a better job of proving me wrong. Because he's like,
[00:52:00] he goes, he goes, I can't believe, I can't believe what you've done in like 22 years type thing,
[00:52:07] you know. Hey, what, when you went to that 3D shoot for the first time on the, on the side of the
[00:52:14] road or whatever, what do you think it, what feeling did you have, what was it that just freaking was like,
[00:52:20] this is it. Uh, yeah, like I listened to Ted Nugent on Rogan and like he gave some crazy
[00:52:28] description of like launching an arrow. It's all poetic and everything. Yeah. What did, is that what you,
[00:52:32] you were just like, no, never had that for me, it was, I couldn't like the fact that I knew
[00:52:42] that that was that showed me how inferior I was with a bow and arrow and I loved hunting.
[00:52:50] And it showed me that there was every person that was in that parking lot was a lot better than me,
[00:52:56] and that was a problem. And, and that 100% was, you know, I had to go to the shop, I had to learn,
[00:53:05] and then it's like, I'm not gonna leave until I beat these guys. These guys that are winning,
[00:53:10] like, I need to beat them. And then once I did that, it was, you know, I remember I, I did really well,
[00:53:18] did well fast, and I remember going to a shoot that was about 45 minutes away to the north,
[00:53:26] and I remember going in there, my name was like written down on a piece of paper that was like
[00:53:32] at this registration desk. And these are rinky-dinks like local shoots, you know? I don't know if like,
[00:53:38] you have like local surf tournaments where it's not like, yeah, yeah. So, I just said, oh, what's up with
[00:53:46] that name you got right there, and they're like, oh, uh, this guy is supposed to be a serious cheater,
[00:53:53] so when he comes, we're gonna send someone out with him. And I go, oh, well that's me, who's coming.
[00:54:03] And wait, so they were thinking this because you had been doing well in the downturn?
[00:54:06] Because I kind of came from nowhere, so these, these people that, that was their thing,
[00:54:13] they're just like, where did this guy come from? Who, who even is he? You know, they'd never
[00:54:17] seen me even at a local club, you know, because I was just nothing, and then when as I always do,
[00:54:24] you know, oh, I'm not good at this, then just like headfirst into the deep in like,
[00:54:30] how many shoot narrows at night, waking up in the morning, shoot narrows, like, you just fall on,
[00:54:34] fall on the session immediately. Yeah. Yeah, like, you know, had to, like sat around after tournaments
[00:54:45] and would like take down courses for places if they'd give me a target, so I'd have another
[00:54:52] target, you know, or, you know, I would freaking cut grass or clean the bottoms of people's boats,
[00:54:59] or whatever, so I could buy another target, and then, you know, I had to have an entire range
[00:55:03] to practice on, and then it just, you know, and then I wanted like a colored target bow, and then it just,
[00:55:10] it's just like, it's me, it's just me, it's who I am all the time, it just, you know, I had to like,
[00:55:16] I had to get good at it, but then there came a point where, um, and actually at that tournament was kind of
[00:55:22] a turning point because this is the cheater one. Yeah, so I went out, did I end up winning that
[00:55:29] tournament and they had someone like writing score, and I said, um, I go, well, that was kind of nice,
[00:55:36] just having someone else keep score. I'm like, hopefully keep score for these other guys that have
[00:55:41] a problem, you know, because it's called like pencil pushing, you know, and they just said, well,
[00:55:46] if you don't want to deal with that, you could always go to Nationals where there's two score
[00:55:50] keepers, and so I'm just like, where's that? So then I went to the National Triple Crown and
[00:55:57] slept in the back of my truck and, you know, shot at that and sucked at it horribly, but then the next
[00:56:05] year, you know, I instead of going like two, I went to all of them, drove to all of them, and just got
[00:56:13] better and got better, and then within like five years, I was at a level that was, you know,
[00:56:19] that I was happy with, but I was also still refining it, you know, just there's, that's what's
[00:56:28] cool about archery is, I think the reason I'm still doing it is because, you know, I still find,
[00:56:36] if I'm not centered, then it shows, so it's hard, like, you're never going to have a perfect
[00:56:41] game to where you can just back away and know that like, okay, that was a Cinderella story I've done,
[00:56:47] because you can go have a perfect round, but then in an hour later, I've seen you have to shoot another
[00:56:54] one, yeah, yep, yep, how do you cheat in archery? Well, I mean, there's just, there's groups where,
[00:57:05] you know, at like a local tournament, they're not going to send a scorekeeper out, so let's just say,
[00:57:11] like, we all went out with our wife. There's definitely people that, you know, they would shoot down
[00:57:16] their in score like an eight, but they just like write a 10. I mean, while like the wives and kids are
[00:57:21] just like not giving a crap about what's going on, but then you just turn in your score card and, you know,
[00:57:27] this, but once you get into like the professional events, there's two people that keep score,
[00:57:35] the majority of the group has to agree on the arrow call, and then if there's ever a divide,
[00:57:43] then you call an official scorekeeper to come and call it, which is kind of a big reason why I liked
[00:57:50] progressing, because once I was shooting like internationally, you know, they had like,
[00:57:57] you couldn't even have an arrow judge that was from your country, so if you, you know, it's like
[00:58:01] if an American needed an arrow call, someone would come over like an official judge from another
[00:58:08] country would come over because obviously now there's teams competing against teams, so,
[00:58:12] you know, these judges had schooling on how to call an arrow and stuff like that. So how does that
[00:58:19] go? Like, you know, I enter the tournament and then what, I just shoot on at my own pace, kind of thing,
[00:58:25] and keep my own score. I think what might be confusing you, I go is like the first tournament
[00:58:30] that he's talking about are just like kind of like local, just going to be like, just going to
[00:58:35] be a festival. It's like going to like a little jiu-jitsu tournament somewhere and there's not like judges.
[00:58:42] You know what I'm saying? Where a jiu-jitsu tournament, like when you have like, I've
[00:58:46] victory, I have an in-house jiu-jitsu tournament, there's no like escalating the call that the point
[00:58:52] keep, you know, your tech, hey man, you lost whatever you did good, someone could be like, oh yeah,
[00:58:56] you know, you're not getting points on that sweep, so these are just like local little tournaments
[00:59:00] where you go out and you score and you're like, you know, my, my eight's pretty close to a 10,
[00:59:05] and I'm going to give it to myself. So there's no one watching, because just you just can't
[00:59:10] you're like on a path through like through this course, to where it's not like golf,
[00:59:16] like professional golf, there'd be like a crowd following like those leaders through that course,
[00:59:22] which in professional archery like that happens. And then once you get into shooting in the finals,
[00:59:28] a lot of times it's like on monitors and everything, so obviously people can see on a big screen,
[00:59:35] where the arrows are landing. So I mean, it probably the same and competitive like rifle and stuff like that.
[00:59:41] Yeah, it's the same in competitive anything. You like really like when you're at a local
[00:59:45] tournament or a weather, it's freaking bowling, you know, like over the line, you know, markets
[00:59:51] zero, they're just having an argument, you know, it's like you can cheat. And then, but then you turn in
[00:59:55] like a score card or something. So when you shoot, you score however many points you, and then you
[01:00:02] write it on a card that you want to the next target. And then you go through a course. Yeah.
[01:00:06] And then you turn in the card. Yeah, it'd be like you play in cribbids with someone at home and
[01:00:10] then I'll send you like, up, I won. They're like, well, wait a minute. Dude, we have to be at least
[01:00:16] even. You're like, no, I'm keeping score like you're so old. Or you go to Vegas and play cribbids,
[01:00:22] just like, you know, everything you're doing is under, you know, amagging the final class type thing.
[01:00:28] So what point did you make the transition? What was it the whole time from like 3D archery to
[01:00:33] target archery? Um, I got I honestly got a little bit bored and 3D archery pretty fast and part of
[01:00:41] the part of what I didn't like about it. There's just, I felt like I was going to the same
[01:00:48] place as all the time because there was I'm trying to think I turned pro and 98. So by like 2003,
[01:00:55] I just felt like I would land know how to get to the shoot without even like,
[01:01:02] wouldn't even need to like look at a map. I'd just know where to go and then you go to these courses
[01:01:07] and it would be like, well, a lot like, you know, we shot big sky together, you know, for the total
[01:01:14] archery challenge and we've shot the same course because it ends in a good place, you know.
[01:01:24] But there's certainly targets that you like you would be like, oh, last year we had the white bunny
[01:01:30] right here, you know. And so it got to the point where it was like that. I was going to places
[01:01:35] around, you know, 26 or 30 weekends a year. I'm traveling to do tournaments and it just felt super
[01:01:44] repetitive and in the end I realized there's probably 10 or 12 people that are fully capable of
[01:01:53] winning like any weekend. But it's almost like if you had that same tournament, you know,
[01:01:59] two consecutive days over and over and over again, there's probably like five that would win it
[01:02:06] differently each of those times. And I don't know, it just came, it just got to be
[01:02:12] stale for me. I got, you know, I just really got bored with that and it got to the point where
[01:02:19] I pretty much had it set in my mind of, I'm a target archer to be a better bow hunter, you know.
[01:02:26] And that was like my mentality is I was just, I could barely be focused by the time the world
[01:02:32] championships rolled around in August. I barely cared because I just wanted to be hunting in September.
[01:02:40] And, you know, that the hunting was always the focus for me and it was like, I almost, I got more
[01:02:46] out of it. So, you know, I just eventually, I did what I needed to do in competitive archery to like
[01:02:53] help me build a platform to where I really wanted to go, which is I've always liked to coach, you know,
[01:03:00] and, and I've always liked really good coaches, you know, I've liked, I'm the type of person where
[01:03:08] I liked coaches that like, honestly that like yelled at me and were like, Paris had coaches,
[01:03:18] we're, you know, Sharon said, that guy just sat there and like, I kind of think I would love that guy.
[01:03:24] You know, if he like grabbed my face mask and he's yelling at me, like, it would make me do better
[01:03:30] on the next play. Whereas now as an adult, I've learned there's certain people where if you did that,
[01:03:38] you're not getting that result. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so wait a second. So, you're doing the target
[01:03:46] archery thing and then, or sorry, you're doing the 3D thing, then you start doing target archery.
[01:03:52] Like, like, well, well, like, well, at what point are you part of team USA and you're putting on the
[01:03:57] team USA stuff? Dang, man, I don't like have my whole life outlined. So, um, I had retired,
[01:04:04] I, you know, I got sick of it, I retired and I was working at a bow manufacturer, you know,
[01:04:11] didn't go back to that, but at 18, um, you know, I started working for this archery shop,
[01:04:16] didn't like the one on one, experienced that archery shop owner was given people buying new equipment.
[01:04:23] And I was spending a lot of time with people. And so I got called in and he told me, you know,
[01:04:29] hey, do not spend that much time with people and they buy new gear. If they go over 15 minutes,
[01:04:36] they need to be paying coaching time per hour. And I just said, well, this, you know, no one was in the
[01:04:42] shop and I didn't have anything else to do. Why wouldn't we help this guy out? And I remember he said,
[01:04:48] well, if you want to run a business that way, then you need to go start your own archery shop.
[01:04:56] So I just thought, okay. And so I went and started my own archery shop, um, about 45 miles away
[01:05:03] at it was actually my family had a, had a horse ranch and Southern Wisconsin at the time, my mom and my sister.
[01:05:10] So I ended up building a pole building there and start my own shop. And that was the same time. I started
[01:05:16] shooting professionally. And then got offered a job from a bow manufacturer to move to northern Wisconsin
[01:05:24] to, you know, come in as like an early sales rep. So I ended up working for this bow company and competing.
[01:05:32] So I mean, my life was archery. Archery 20 hours a day. And then I kind of got burned out with it. And I found
[01:05:42] myself liking going fishing or going hunting or just doing something that wasn't like training,
[01:05:48] training, training for archery. And then I had retired for like a few months and retired from.
[01:05:56] I kind of just said, I'm not going to shoot professionally anymore. And I just stepped away. And I was
[01:06:01] doing some coaching. And like I was doing a lot for some different like youth camps and stuff.
[01:06:08] And I remember seeing another archer at like at a trade show. And he said something about,
[01:06:19] you know, I heard you're not shooting anymore. And I just said, yeah, I got, you know, bored with it.
[01:06:23] And I kind of just jokingly said, you know, maybe I'll come over to target archery. Just 3D
[01:06:29] archery is all like foam animal targets with molded in scoring rings, ranging from, you know,
[01:06:36] the size of a dime, you know, up to like what would be considered just the vitals, which would be bigger.
[01:06:43] But then target like a dinner plate size. Yeah. But then for target archery, there's several
[01:06:48] different formats. And that's bulls eyes, you know, with scoring rings. But a lot of different
[01:06:54] games to play, right, you know, there's tons of different formats of shooting at a bull's
[01:06:59] I target different distances. Some, you don't know the distance. You have to estimate it. Some have
[01:07:05] like multiple size faces, some are certain amount of arrows at this distance, certain amount of
[01:07:10] that distance at this. But anyway, I said to this guy, yeah, maybe I'll just, I don't know,
[01:07:17] maybe I should just try target archery. And I remember, he looked at me because, come on in the
[01:07:23] water's fine. Oh, thank you. Last week. And that was it. I was like, okay, wins the first tournament.
[01:07:32] And the first, he told me the first tournament was at the Arizona Cup in at the Ben Avery.
[01:07:40] Did you ever shoot the Ben Avery Center in Arizona? So that was the first one and ended up,
[01:07:48] ended up in the metal, you know, gold metal match with that guy at that event. With that guy,
[01:07:53] with that guy in your first event. Yeah, that one. And I showed up like everything I had was wrong
[01:08:02] because, you know, there's, I don't know how to describe it. It'd be like if you did, you know,
[01:08:09] tactical, you know, tactical competition and then someone will ask you to go to a sniper event
[01:08:15] and then you like showed up with your M4 or something. You know, I don't know. No, it's, it's mission
[01:08:19] specific. Yeah. They're both archery, but one of them has like you're standing around. You got
[01:08:25] more time to shoot or whatever. Last time to shoot. Yours gear's going to be different to
[01:08:29] homeland yards. Yeah. So I remember right before that metal match. And as it happened, I was
[01:08:38] low in the brackets. He was, you know, very high in the brackets, but we were on opposite ends of
[01:08:42] the brackets. And so at this center, you know, there's, you know, let's say it's 100 yards wide.
[01:08:50] I was like at this end and he was at that end. And as you shoot against someone and go through
[01:08:56] the brackets, he just come to the middle. So like when I won my semi-final match, I remember like
[01:09:03] looking over and I saw that he won. I'm like, okay, here we go. And he comes over and he said,
[01:09:09] man, he's like, how, he's, he's said, how, how you deal with it? And I said, dealing with what? And
[01:09:17] he said, well, I've won this nine times and, you know, everyone wants me to lose and he said, so I
[01:09:24] can imagine like, you know, the pressure you're feeling, you know, being that guy. And I said,
[01:09:30] man, I, I see it the other way. And he goes, what do you mean? I said, do you know, I'm out here,
[01:09:36] my equipment's a joke. I said, I'm out here. I'm a 3D shooter. I got the wrong freaking bow. I got the
[01:09:42] wrong arrows. Never even shot this far. And I said, and I'm getting ready to roll up on you.
[01:09:49] And I said, and I'm like, you want to nine times. And honestly, I could see like that was, you know,
[01:09:57] that cracked and I ended up getting the gold medal there. Oh, you, so the person you wanted.
[01:10:03] Yeah, that's freaking nuts. So then I guess that pretty much kicked off your target archery.
[01:10:10] Yeah, yeah. So we, um, and there was a lot of, like, that kicked off my target archery. So I did one
[01:10:16] type, then I did another type. And then I went into field archery, which is my favorite.
[01:10:21] It's kind of like the tack, but with with different size bull's eyes and granted, you know,
[01:10:28] in the pro class, these guys aren't missing. It's like, you need perfect scores. You know, you really do.
[01:10:34] And I went to this field, um, this field tournament and just sucked at it because half of it is
[01:10:42] marked. The other half is unmarked. So you unmarked, meaning unknown distance, unknown distance,
[01:10:48] which in archery is a problem if you don't know the distance, because your arrow is what
[01:10:52] waste lower than a bullet. So, um, I wasn't good at it and ended up buying myself an entire field
[01:10:59] round and like, you know, reading up on, you know, target faces and then ended up figuring out a
[01:11:07] mathematical formula to estimate distances using, like, the circles in my scope and the circles of the
[01:11:14] bull's eye. So I'd like frame the side of my scope to the edge of the target and then I memorized where
[01:11:22] my center dot would be based on the rings and just memorized, engaging a distance, gauging formula,
[01:11:31] which is what everybody does, but most people keep it secretive on how, you know, what their system is.
[01:11:37] But because of the targets, they're all regulation and they have to be the same size you can figure it out.
[01:11:43] So then, um, I got good at that, you know, and, and that was kind of my favorite and then, you know,
[01:11:49] made a team, made a U.S. team and then went over and competed. I think my first international
[01:11:56] term, it was in Croatia and, you know, freaking just loved, metal there and, you know, loved, freaking
[01:12:05] when they pulled that American flag up and like, you got to hear your anthem, it was just like,
[01:12:11] okay, this is freaking, this is awesome. And so how long did that career run for?
[01:12:17] That career ran until the archery world archery decided to do a world cup and they decided to make the
[01:12:27] world cup, um, so at the world cup, I think only two at the year. At the time, it was maybe two or three
[01:12:35] archers, you had to be on a team, um, which shoot in the world cups, but whoever the finalists,
[01:12:42] the top four were at the end of the world cup, then you had to go to the world cup finals,
[01:12:48] which was like a big thing. And they decided to add one tournament and move the world cup
[01:12:55] finals. It was like September 15th this year. And so I remember, um, world archery telling me,
[01:13:06] you know, hey, if you're going to shoot on the world cup team, you have to give us the commitment
[01:13:12] that you will not only do all four world cups, but if you make the world cup final that you
[01:13:17] also participate in the world cup final, otherwise we're going to find someone that will, you know,
[01:13:24] because we don't want to like end up making a final and then someone don't can't get off work or
[01:13:29] whatever. And so I, you know, as in September, I just said, I am not competing in archery in September.
[01:13:34] And for everyone that doesn't know, September is freaking prime, that's something. Yeah.
[01:13:40] That's when you, you're only thinking about, you're thinking about one thing and one thing.
[01:13:44] Yes, just freaking hunting. That's it. That's it. And so you kind of walked. Yeah, I walked.
[01:13:53] Now, and I walked for, I walked from there and then, you know, I ended up business wise,
[01:14:01] started consulting, went out on my own, started consulting, you know, started a family,
[01:14:07] sharing an eye, you know, it was like I wanted to be home more. A lot more people could come to me,
[01:14:13] you know, for coaching and stuff. I was, I was coaching around the world at that time.
[01:14:20] But yeah, just, you know, life changes. You become, you know, close to 30. It's just, you know, I didn't.
[01:14:29] I just didn't see the future that I wanted just being a target archer my whole life.
[01:14:36] You know, and I think, you know, we talked about this. I think some fighters are in that same
[01:14:40] position of like, yeah, you love it. And, you know, you can go when like fight of the night and you
[01:14:47] could make a pretty good paycheck for that time. But the reality is like, your one or two fights a year
[01:14:54] that you're going to make a paycheck at, they're going to make 98% of the rest of your life,
[01:15:00] not as, you know, not what you could make for it if you had a different focus. So, you know,
[01:15:07] I just, I just focused on something else. Now, from a business perspective, did you have the
[01:15:15] vision of like knock on archery? Because essentially what you do is freaking give away an incredible
[01:15:25] amount of knowledge and information and instruction. That's what you do. That did you know from
[01:15:30] the beginning, hey, listen, if I just give this stuff away, then people will, you know, want,
[01:15:36] want to buy some of the stuff that I recommend. You lie some of the equipment that I make.
[01:15:40] Is that did you have that vision or did it just start to happen?
[01:15:45] It's hard to say if I was in a different position than if I would have felt that way. Because
[01:15:50] I don't feel like I'm greedy. I feel like the better I do for myself and other avenues of life,
[01:15:58] the more I can give back to my sport and I want to because, you know, I feel like, hey, I'm
[01:16:04] doing fine. You know, and I want to help other people be better. But the truth of the matter is,
[01:16:09] you know, when you're in your 20s, making 30 grand a year or 50 grand a year, your job,
[01:16:16] and you're trying to go to tournaments to win an extra 10 on the weekend and you're just putting
[01:16:22] a lot of time in and you're shooting 20 to 30,000 arrows, you know, a year,
[01:16:29] and living out of, you know, sharing rooms with people and stuff like that. Like, there's a lot of
[01:16:34] stepping stones that have to, there's a lot of sacrifices you make before it gets to the point where
[01:16:39] it's like, you know, you could offer all that for free. But once the community and by that,
[01:16:50] I mean, you know, I refer to them as the knock on nation. Once we had a pedestal to where we were
[01:16:57] able to deliver out information and our community came in and started supporting that initiative,
[01:17:05] then it allows me, you know, the more people support like either things that we offer at the
[01:17:13] store or let's say I do a training series and there's a training series that helps someone do better,
[01:17:22] but maybe there's a product that we have as our business. You know, that'll be in there and I know
[01:17:27] not everyone's going to buy it. But if someone does, you know, if they really like that series
[01:17:33] and it was worth, you know, a hundred bucks to them, I would rather than sit in them paying
[01:17:38] that subscription to like support us with, you know, a product that we have that I personally believe
[01:17:46] in for that particular thing. Now everyone has their preference, but I don't think I could have
[01:17:52] done it that way to begin with even though when I was kind of hustling and doing what I could
[01:17:59] to like, you know, build, I would always go and do youth camps or go do Christian camps and do
[01:18:07] stuff like that for free. Like I always did that. I always worked with, you know, the kids after
[01:18:12] the tournament or, you know, it kind of got to the point where I told sponsors, especially when I
[01:18:21] went out and I was kind of consulting, I told sponsors, I would like to travel through Europe
[01:18:27] and go to every archery club and do a seminar. But, you know, I can't pay for it myself. Would you,
[01:18:35] you know, would you like to be the one that sponsors the event in Doosal Dwarf, you know, and if so
[01:18:42] send me 25 of your hats and some keychains or whatever and that's what we'll put on everyone's
[01:18:47] seat that, you know, that comes. And so we just do these tours where I'd have magazine editors
[01:18:53] drive me all around Europe and every day was a different stop, you know, just kind of like a band.
[01:19:00] Every day was a different archery club, stop, teach archery and then, you know, do it. In the end,
[01:19:07] I made something more because, you know, the sponsors were paying something and, you know,
[01:19:14] getting some exposure from it and then I also did a lot of writing. You know, I did a lot of
[01:19:19] a lot of written coaching first because like getting your foot in the door when you don't
[01:19:26] technically have like a name for yourself yet is a little bit of a struggle. But I saw a lot of
[01:19:33] magazines needing fresh content and so, you know, I just started writing. So, from like
[01:19:40] 2000, I would say from 2005 to probably 2000, 12 or 14, I wrote for like seven different languages.
[01:19:55] I'd probably do about 250 pages a year just in articles and honestly, my thing was I'd send
[01:20:03] these articles out. I didn't really make hardly anything off any of the articles. I just always
[01:20:09] made sure that they used my photo content so that, you know, I was able to give exposure to the
[01:20:15] brands that I represented and so, you know, it's just kind of like the perfect storm of having
[01:20:22] enough support to where I could grow into where I wanted to be and then, you know, then eventually
[01:20:29] like knock on knock on's like evolved. Originally, it was a TV show, it was just a hunting show,
[01:20:36] but it was a hunting show that I was very focused on having educational portions. I didn't
[01:20:41] like be role in hunting shows, you know, I didn't. I always thought there needs to be more
[01:20:47] education and how to and why was this hunt successful or here's the equipment that I'm taking on
[01:20:54] this hunt, you know, I changed arrows or changed broadheads, here's the why, you know, here's
[01:20:59] different mistakes you can make as a bow hunter for shooting technique. So, that kind of gave us
[01:21:05] the platform to create a name for ourselves and then obviously, you know, we've just continually built
[01:21:13] we meaning I've only ever done the content, the brand was always sharing, you know, the brand
[01:21:19] and, you know, knock on archery.com has always been sharing, where is, you know, I really don't like
[01:21:27] that side of things, I just really want to like, I want to teach people from my experience of
[01:21:33] whatever's happening at the moment. How the TV show come about? The TV show came because
[01:21:42] one of the companies that I worked for was an archery company and so each year they would pick a
[01:21:50] a certain demographic and tell me to focus my initiatives there to grow the brand and that
[01:21:56] demographic. So, one time it was, you know, South Africa, another time it was like Germany,
[01:22:04] another time it was Australia but it came around to Canada and so I went up and talked to a lot of
[01:22:09] shops up there and said, you know, hey, what do you guys think about doing like a seminar tour like
[01:22:15] what was working for me and other demographics? Because over there, people were jumping on that
[01:22:21] because no one would travel over there to do that. Maybe it's like that, what you just see,
[01:22:25] if a, if a reputable coach travels to somewhere where they're never going to see that person,
[01:22:30] they, it'll sell out, you know, for sure. Versus in Canada, they said, at the time,
[01:22:36] Canada just got their first outdoor TV network, which was called Wild TV and they had hunting
[01:22:42] shows but most of their shows were shows that we had watched here five, 10 years ago and it was just
[01:22:49] all the shows domestically were sent in all their repeats up there and just like, you know, just
[01:22:53] kind of rebranding. But then also like selling that airtime to their sponsors here like, yeah,
[01:23:00] we're also airing, you know, 10 times a week in Canada for this or that. So when I was up there,
[01:23:08] the shop said, well, I mean, we would love to get like super technical seminars but what brings
[01:23:17] people in the doors when the hunting shows come. Like if, if you're on a hunting show,
[01:23:21] there, if you're on Wild TV, we'll freaking pack the store. So I remember going back to my boss
[01:23:28] at the time who actually works for us now and I told him I said, well, they really said to get
[01:23:34] the foot in the door like, we need to be, I need to be a show and I had already done DVDs that were like,
[01:23:41] you know, kind of out of the, the trunk of your car DVDs that I thought were a little bit of
[01:23:48] head of their time because I always said that like I wanted our hunting show to be like hunting,
[01:23:56] kind of crashed with MTV cribs, crashed with like Robin Big. And so like our first DVDs,
[01:24:06] that's what they were. And so they were to like way faster pace music and like way different editing
[01:24:12] than kind of like the band you put those on YouTube. I haven't, I need to get you one of those DVDs.
[01:24:17] How can we go put them on YouTube on your YouTube channel? People are going to be amped to watch it now.
[01:24:23] Maybe that I mean, looking bad, be like you watching yourself on video 10 years ago, you'd be like,
[01:24:29] man was I horrible. Well, you at least got to have some fun with it and put them on. Oh, yeah,
[01:24:34] I mean, for that haircut you posted. Prince Valkyrie, the kind of guy. That was freaking awesome.
[01:24:43] Bro, it was 1977. That was what was happening. And I didn't, I don't think I even have. I don't think,
[01:24:49] I don't even think I thought, you know what I'm saying? I didn't think I thought about like a haircut.
[01:24:54] I think it was just, you know, my mom would come in with a pair of scissors. You know, done.
[01:24:59] Like I wasn't like, do I need hair? I still have a minute. Yeah. Do I need to get a haircut? Do I not
[01:25:04] need to get a haircut? She's just like, that's, it was like, that's what's happening, right? You don't have
[01:25:08] any choice in the matter. And didn't care about it one way that I still barely care. I feel like
[01:25:13] when we post this podcast, we need to put a thing in there that says like, unless you're
[01:25:17] to work about our tree fast forward to like the hair moment. Because me talking about my past to
[01:25:26] me seems like, I don't know, I'd weigh rather. What I remember about you, the most is like,
[01:25:32] how hard we laugh at stuff. And you know, it's such a different side than, you know,
[01:25:39] kind of like at the beginning of the thing when you're reading your socials and awesome at that,
[01:25:45] like you're the perfect person to like do voice over work. But I also know like any given second,
[01:25:52] if it was just the two of us, you could drop a one liner in there that would freaking bust people up in
[01:25:58] here. Yeah, I definitely, I mean, that's, bro, yeah, you're right. Any of this stuff. It's like,
[01:26:05] you have a fun while you're doing it. It's not fun to do. Then why are you doing it? Yeah,
[01:26:10] I will say though, like I like to have fun. You like to have fun, but man, it's legit. When you go into
[01:26:14] like Kilmode on a hunt, it's freaking out. I'm like, oh, yeah, here it is. Because you go into just like
[01:26:21] boom, like I could, I just see I'm like, okay, I gotta hang on because he's freaking, he's going. And
[01:26:26] it's legit, man. Well, I think that same thing that's just inside, it's dormant and I'm pretty,
[01:26:33] I'm pretty like Loki and Dossel most of the time. I feel like that's how I am naturally, but then
[01:26:43] certain things like that when that moment triggers and it's like a game face, that's kind of what
[01:26:50] happened when I recognized like I wasn't good at archery. You know, I realized like, you know,
[01:26:56] I just, it's like hyper focused and it gets that way with my training too. If I know I'm not
[01:27:05] up to par, I get very hyper focused on just getting better and training and I can kind of just go
[01:27:13] over the deep, you know, I can either be all in or totally out, which is kind of like for
[01:27:19] Matargetartary point of view, people ask me why I don't compete. I don't have, like I don't have
[01:27:25] a drive to compete. That's not to say if for some reason I, you know, did it accidentally and
[01:27:32] I would get fired up again. Oh no, I've seen you do that. I've seen you that where we're walking
[01:27:37] down the tack and all of a sudden someone's like, hey, dud, I bet I can do this. I bet I can hit that.
[01:27:43] You're like, same thing. I'll see your face and I'm like, oh, he's about to just 12,
[01:27:47] bring this thing, you know, because you get in that competitive mode that happens. You know what,
[01:27:52] I wanted to come back to and, and hey, the reason why I think this stuff is interesting. Look,
[01:27:56] I don't think you have to be interested in archery because your, your path in life was not normal,
[01:28:03] right? And people look, you could have been talking about someone that was into spearfishing or someone
[01:28:07] that was into jiu-jitsu or someone that was into anything to go down the path like you did and
[01:28:14] forge your own way ahead and make a life for yourself based on doing something that you loved.
[01:28:19] People could apply that in any category, whether you're into knitting or whether you're into freaking
[01:28:25] bowling, it doesn't matter. So there's some real application. I guess I should have said that the
[01:28:30] beginning, hey, if you're thinking about the way your life looks, especially if you're 20 years old or
[01:28:35] 25 years old and you're kind of like, well, I'm doing this, but I don't like it. I mean,
[01:28:38] here you are, like, going to college, but I don't really want to do that, you know? Yeah.
[01:28:41] Hey, and you've done that multiple times, 3D archery, totally into, oh, guess what? I'm not
[01:28:45] really into it that much into it anymore. Okay, I'm going to do something else. Go to target
[01:28:49] archery. Okay. I'm really into that for a while. I guess what? It's interfering with my
[01:28:52] hunting. Not going to do that anymore. Now I'm going to focus on hunting. I'm going to focus on building
[01:28:55] this brand. I'm going to focus on creating new products. So all that stuff, it may seem mundane to you
[01:29:01] looking back at it, but for a normal person that can take this and apply it to, you know,
[01:29:08] building something, creating something, it's like you've done well, not just from an archery perspective,
[01:29:14] but a business perspective, in, at the same time. So it's real lessons. One of the lessons I
[01:29:20] wanted to come back to, because we kind of drifted over it, but when you were talking about,
[01:29:25] as somewhere along the way, you realized that you could like freaking rage doesn't help, right?
[01:29:32] Rage doesn't help, and you said you had a coach that was like, hey, listen,
[01:29:36] the arrows that you shot, and this is such an important, again, this is a life lesson, and
[01:29:40] there's all kinds of things that tie into life and archery, but the life lesson is like, hey,
[01:29:45] you shot that arrow and you freaking shanked it, right? You can blow your next eight arrows,
[01:29:51] like you can just send them all out the freaking, you know, into a tree somewhere, or you can just be like,
[01:29:56] okay, that didn't, doesn't matter. Can't change it, move forward. What was that lesson like,
[01:30:02] who taught it to you? An Olympic arch, an Olympic archery coach who I'm pretty sure was also a
[01:30:09] Marine, I mean, straight up Marine haircut all the time, but he coached a couple, a couple,
[01:30:16] super high-level archers, but he was also like, he didn't coach very many people, and he was also,
[01:30:23] you know, very, I don't know, he was very like stone, you know, so you knew if he was there,
[01:30:31] he was there watching his few athletes, and they like would pay for him to come and stuff like that,
[01:30:39] but I remember one time I was in a leading group, we got peer grouped, and then the second day,
[01:30:47] you know, like ranks 1, 2, 3 and 4 together on the target, you know, in the shoot through, and then it
[01:30:53] kind of came down to the last target, and you know, I needed a 12 or something to make it into the
[01:31:00] shoot off, you know, into the top 6, and I missed, you know, and I was freaking pissed about, you know,
[01:31:09] like broke my stabilizer over my knee and freaking hammer tossed my bow through the woods type thing,
[01:31:15] and, you know, ended up coming back, like with my bow, just kind of seeing the damage I did,
[01:31:21] and he came over to me, his name was Tim Strickland, and he said, you know, you could be an amazing
[01:31:32] archer, but he said, until you start not letting the arrow that you shoot affect the ones that are
[01:31:39] still in your quiver, you never will, and he said, he goes, do you know a way to get an arrow back once
[01:31:45] it's left your bow, and I said, what do you mean he goes, do you know a way to get it back other
[01:31:50] than to physically go down there and pull it out of the target like you just did, and I said no
[01:31:53] sir, and he said, well, once it's gone, it's gone, and he said, so if you make one mistake,
[01:32:02] don't make the same mistake for every arrow that's left in your quiver, you know, make one,
[01:32:09] pull it, you know, pull that arrow out, throw it away, whatever you want, but there's other
[01:32:14] arrows in the quiver that are capable of doing what you want them to do, and so there's been
[01:32:21] tournaments where I've, you know, I've actually talked, you know, where I will freaking make a bad
[01:32:26] shot, and then just look down on my quiver and be like, do any of you sons of bitches want to
[01:32:30] go in the tenoring because that guy didn't, and you know, and it was just like a totally different
[01:32:36] approach and mentally, it honestly helped me, this was a, it's kind of a weird thing to say,
[01:32:49] but, you know, he told me said, you won't figure out how to win until you learn how to lose,
[01:32:57] and that was, you know, I was like the rage of losing was overpowering my ability to perform at
[01:33:05] my best because I was letting, you know, I was letting those things happen, and then I remember
[01:33:10] kind of wanting to get into that a little more, and I read some kind of a sports psychology
[01:33:16] book, you know, I don't know what it was called, but it said something in there that
[01:33:21] this sports psychologist had talked to like, he worked with a lot of high-level pictures,
[01:33:28] and he told him that part of their success was that they had to be able to accept that there was
[01:33:34] going to be an empire that would, they needed to expect two to three bad calls by the
[01:33:40] empire, every game, and when they got a call that they didn't think was right, they could just
[01:33:47] check it off the list of okay, well, there was one of them, and so I started doing that too,
[01:33:53] and started saying, okay, when I go to an international event because there are certainly
[01:33:59] our judges that call them really, really tight, you know, and they're all looking at them with
[01:34:06] the magnifying glass, but they're some like when you'll say like judge, and then, you know,
[01:34:13] some dude comes over that isn't a tour, like if that, you know, when they do the random thing of
[01:34:19] like judge, so and so go pull it, and then you see him, you're like, it's out.
[01:34:23] Because some of them, you just think like, they think like if they can't figure it out themselves,
[01:34:30] I'm just going to go over there and look around at it, but I'm calling it out, and then there'd
[01:34:33] be some like, oh yeah, I got a chance with this guy, like, you know, hey, Susie, how you doing today?
[01:34:39] Yeah. But yeah, learning that, you know, learning how to lose, because I've lost way
[01:34:47] more than I've won, and that's a fact, you know, you have to figure out a way to win in life,
[01:34:55] you know, you do have to figure out a way to win, but if you deal with like being a hyper-competitive,
[01:35:04] then you also have to learn how to lose, otherwise you freaking derail yourself, way more than
[01:35:11] others can derail you, and I'm convinced that I beat myself way more than other people beat
[01:35:17] me and most of the things that I've lost at, you know, it's like, which is why now my coachings
[01:35:23] involved so much, because now my coaching is so focused on, you know, what you execute within your
[01:35:29] box, because I kind of got to the point where I recognized if I make a good shot, it's a 10,
[01:35:37] that's the highest score on the paper. So if I do that all day, no one's going to beat me,
[01:35:44] we're tied at the end, and if I just keep doing that until tomorrow, then guess what, worst case
[01:35:50] scenario, me and that other guy are still tied, but if I shoot nines, then yeah, the other guy
[01:35:57] is already in advantage. So, you know, if I focus on just execution, and so once I kind of came to
[01:36:04] that realization of no one can beat me if I'm executing, if I make a good shot right here,
[01:36:12] I don't need to see where it lands, because if my site tapes right, and I trust the equipment
[01:36:17] that I've got, I know it's in the middle, like I know that, but I have to execute here, and so
[01:36:23] it really got to the point where I like, I took away my spotting scope to where I wasn't getting
[01:36:28] in the habit of shooting an arrow looking for the result, shooting an arrow looking in a result,
[01:36:34] which is something that even today, when I work with parents, I tell them that there's,
[01:36:41] there's like parents that at an archery tournament, they sit like front row with a spotting scope,
[01:36:47] so the kid will shoot, and then they'll be like 10 at 11 o'clock, and then, you know,
[01:36:53] the kid will shoot and just turn around to like dad to get confirmation of like how that was,
[01:37:00] and so part of the things when you have that type of parent is telling them like, listen,
[01:37:05] this kid, like they need to execute, them looking for you at you for, you know, the result,
[01:37:14] all the time, it just athletes start to lean on their coach so much, and that was actually one of the
[01:37:21] problems with some of the people that had that coach that I talked about. They only did really well
[01:37:28] when he could be there with them, because, you know, he'd be like, all right, hey, you miss that one,
[01:37:34] if those guys, you know, you're good, you're the free, you know, and they had to have that, that
[01:37:40] continual like affirmation, whereas honestly, for my life, I feel like most of it, I was alone,
[01:37:48] you know, in regards to like, I like training alone, you know, honestly, I like archery too,
[01:37:55] because it's a singular sport, so if I train and if I prep, then I'm ready, and it's in my hands,
[01:38:06] same with hunting, you know, same way with hunting. If I, you know, I've had hunts where I've had a lot of
[01:38:10] distractions, and I threw my stuff in a case that, you know, the day before and went and, you know,
[01:38:16] missed a couple shots and was just like, in rage, but then I also thought like, yeah, dude, you didn't
[01:38:21] prep, you didn't know homework, you know, that's what happens. So I feel like, because I've had to
[01:38:27] train that way, and even even when I lift, you know, I love lifting by myself versus like going to
[01:38:34] somewhere where people distract me, I just feel like, you know, I've, I know that if I put in the work,
[01:38:42] then at that point, it's, it's really on me, not on someone else, and like, when I told you,
[01:38:49] we sucked it football, you know, there was a couple people like, you know, like Jason, who knew their role
[01:38:57] and knew their position, and other people's position, and they would cover for people that maybe
[01:39:01] didn't do something right, but there's also three cores of the team that didn't. So in high school,
[01:39:08] what's hard is, I don't feel like anyone really prepped as hard as me in that because I honestly
[01:39:14] like put no effort anywhere else, you know, whereas they probably had lives and maybe, you know,
[01:39:20] actually got good grades and stuff. But I think that's why artre's been so awesome to me is because,
[01:39:29] you know, the harder I've pushed, the harder I've pushed at it and the more I've put into it,
[01:39:34] like, it's not like weightlifting where you plateau, I haven't found a plateau yet, like,
[01:39:40] I can make a target further and I can suck again. Or, you know, you know, there's just
[01:39:46] ore I can try a different species or a different, you know, climate or a different time of year,
[01:39:53] and it's a whole new challenge, like it's a clean slate, and then you're, you know, trying to
[01:39:59] formulate a plan and map out a plan of how do I, you know, how do I, like, win this challenge?
[01:40:06] Or, I was at a, you know, I were at tack the first time we did tack and like I was just
[01:40:14] like feeling pretty good and I'm like, you know, you're like, bro, you're freaking, this is awesome,
[01:40:18] you're doing great and we're getting through the course a little bit and then man,
[01:40:24] then I just, I like hit a branch, right? And it was a little situation where you said step back
[01:40:31] and you meant back behind me, but I thought you meant back away from the target. And so I like
[01:40:38] didn't, it even makes sense to me what you said, so I didn't listen to you, which is a mistake.
[01:40:41] So I just cracked off this round and this thing just freaking just,
[01:40:47] paying into a tree and everyone on that mountain, everyone, like, it sounded like you hit someone's
[01:40:55] like door with a Mac, like with a microphone on the back side, just there.
[01:41:00] And this is what I saw as earlier, you know, you're saying like, hey, you know,
[01:41:04] what somebody grabs me by the face mask and just like, you need to get this shit together right now.
[01:41:07] Like, that's what you want. And then, but like, I've, I've done that, like, when I was in,
[01:41:13] when I was in the, when I was in the seal teams and I was teaching, like, I would be, you know,
[01:41:18] I'd have some guy that I could be like, hey, man, if I freak out in this guy, he's going to freak out.
[01:41:21] And he's going to collapse and break down mentally. And I got someone else where it was like,
[01:41:25] if I don't get their attention, you know, some guy might pull sides to hey, listen man, think about what's
[01:41:29] going on. Another guy in me, but hey, you need to think about what's going on. And you got to figure out what
[01:41:33] methodology you're going to use. Yeah. So what's what's interesting for me is when you're coaching me,
[01:41:39] like, I know what you're doing. I know that I go, oh, he's, he's trying to get me to chill out.
[01:41:44] Because like, on that one, you were like, you're like, hey, man, hit, you hit that limb up there.
[01:41:47] You know, it's just trying to say, but, you know, he said, you know, knocking another one,
[01:41:51] knock the ticket step back, knocking another one. I was like, cool. And I was like, he's just trying to
[01:41:54] get me to chill out. So I don't freak out because I just freaking tea bone to tree. And like, I know
[01:42:00] what you're doing, but as echo Charles says sometimes to me, he knows what I'm doing when I'm talking
[01:42:05] him about stuff. He's like, I know what you're doing. Guess what, still works. Yeah. It still works to be like,
[01:42:10] hey, here's it's going on. Man, just just back off a little bit or do your freaking out. You're not,
[01:42:15] you know how to do this. Like, those kind of coach and also being like, hey, get over here. Like,
[01:42:19] hey, you need to move down. Like, those kind of things are important. So for you as a coach, the way
[01:42:24] you read and I've watched now I've watched you coach a bunch, but like at tack, you'll sit there,
[01:42:28] like we'll sit there at a place at one of the targets and you'll just like watch four or five
[01:42:33] groups shoot. And so I just sit there and watch you coach him, you know, and I'll listen to what you're
[01:42:37] saying. And you, I can tell that you're going, you're reading people, you know, and going, oh,
[01:42:42] this person needs confidence or this person needs to think through needs to slow things down. Or this
[01:42:48] person's getting freaking all all target fixated at the last second and they're cracking around
[01:42:53] off. So you're reading them and then you're applying the right coaching technique to what's
[01:42:57] going on in their head. And that's freaking, that's just like, that's why honestly to me,
[01:43:04] your whole life, the number one thing for me when I look at you is like coach, like that's the
[01:43:08] the highest thing that I look at you. I was like, man, that guy's off. Look, he's a good
[01:43:12] arturer. He's a good hunter. He's a badass athlete, but man, he's a freaking dialed in coach.
[01:43:19] It's what I'm passionate about. Like, especially, you know, with honestly, Rogan
[01:43:26] introduced to me to Andy, like I think was really the thing that started everything down the path of
[01:43:34] now how many military guys that I've been able to get into and gals, get into archery.
[01:43:40] And, you know, I love that because there's so many things that are there, and especially with
[01:43:51] team guys, you know, whether it's, you know, army or, you know, it really doesn't matter.
[01:43:59] But if they've been some type of a team or like special forces, they just, you know,
[01:44:06] they're good students and they're hyper critical of themselves. Now, granted, some of them were like,
[01:44:11] I got this and yeah, once they realized, no, I just made it as to myself, they'll listen.
[01:44:18] But even if they don't listen right there, by the next time they talked to you, they've a hundred
[01:44:22] percent, you know, went crazy about trying to apply that, you know, the work ethic is very,
[01:44:30] it's like the perfect formula for a coach, you know, is all those guys and every, every one of them
[01:44:37] that I've introduced it to so far has needed, has really needed archery as, I don't know, like,
[01:44:47] like you said, it's like a quiet, it's like a quiet form of what you used to do, you know.
[01:44:52] Well, what it is really, tell me it's a new mission. Like you spend your whole life
[01:44:57] with a mission, with like something that you know that you're focused on and then one day you wake up,
[01:45:04] like you retire or you get out, the mission's gone. Like you can't have it anymore and look,
[01:45:09] you can try and hang on onto it and you can try and freaking relive those things in your head,
[01:45:12] but that's not going to be, that's not going to work out because it's not there anymore.
[01:45:17] And that's a shitty reality to face. Like when I had to clean, when I retired and then I went and
[01:45:23] cleaned out my cage and I spent most of my career within like a 300-yard radius, like Seal Team
[01:45:31] 1, Seal Team 3, Seal Team 7, I was at Seal Team 2 in Virginia Beach for a little while, but most of
[01:45:37] it, you could throw a football to everywhere I was. So when I was 19 years old, I was walking up
[01:45:43] the steps of Seal Team 1, fast forward 20, 24 years and I'm 200 yards away, not even, I'm 100 yards
[01:45:50] away, cleaning out my gear locker for the last time. And it's gone and all that, my whole life,
[01:45:56] what everything I cared about, the only thing I ever knew is gone. And look, I look back at it,
[01:46:03] if I can help out in any way and I go talk to the teams, that's cool, but that's not my mission anymore.
[01:46:09] And so this happens to guys and they get out and they don't have a mission anymore. So all of a
[01:46:15] sudden you go, hey man, here's a freaking bow and arrow, it's a primitive tool that you used a
[01:46:21] hunt ship and you can get good at it. And the fundamentals are similar, you know, the fundamentals are
[01:46:29] similar and like when you taught me for the first time Andy was sitting there translating. He's like,
[01:46:35] hey, what he means is frontside focus, hey, what he means is easy, easy, you know, uh, just squeeze the
[01:46:41] trigger. He was translating me for me, military stuff and I was like, oh God, it got it, got it. And,
[01:46:47] you know, Andy, I mean Andy's a good example of him just being like, oh cool, I got a new mission now.
[01:46:52] Here's what I can do. And look, Andy, of course, Andy has a ton of other things going on in his life
[01:46:57] and he's got freaking parachuting in, uh, jiu-jitsu now, he's totally obsessed with jiu-jitsu, which is
[01:47:02] freaking awesome. So people find new mission, but this is a good one. It's a good one because there's so
[01:47:07] many similarities, gear prep, right? When you're in the SEAL teams, you're freaking obsessed with gear
[01:47:12] prep, you're figuring out the best way to carry things, the best way to do things. And you're like,
[01:47:15] okay, I want to be ready for this. I want to be ready for this operation, right? I got to be in
[01:47:20] a good physical shape. I got to be able to like clear my mind when shit's going sideways and be like,
[01:47:26] all right, what's happening right now. So all those things are are so similar and I know that you
[01:47:32] spend, I guess, was Andy the first like vet that you worked with? Probably that, I mean,
[01:47:41] probably not, I guess, but yeah, it was the first one where I was, where I was mentally really ready for that.
[01:47:48] I think I was on a different, like, pole position, like I was at a different stage. And it,
[01:47:53] it honestly, it meant more, you know, I was going to say with Andy, like, Andy, what may have been different
[01:48:00] is that Andy was like, what is that saying about like, when the, when the student is ready, the
[01:48:05] master will appear? Like, I don't know if you could have found someone that was more ready to like,
[01:48:10] pick up this stuff and start going, you know? And so that's probably why it left an impression on you.
[01:48:17] It damn sure left an impression on Andy, because this dude's totally obsessed, you know? So
[01:48:22] and it's awesome. And you know what's funny about it? Well, Andy's freaking hilarious. You want
[01:48:27] it like, yeah, when you talk about like, oh, Jocca, you make some good one minors hanging out. Like,
[01:48:31] I can listen to Andy just all day long. And what's really funny to him to me is like, how he,
[01:48:38] the way he handles, uh, uh, like, mistakes. His, he just hammers himself. He's so freaking hilarious.
[01:48:46] He leaves no room for someone to make front of them. Because if, if you don't fire off within three
[01:48:52] seconds, yeah, yeah, he's freaking classic classic. Yeah. And that's the kind of thing is when, you know,
[01:48:59] when when you go out, it gives you a mission. Now you got your friends with you. You know, now you're like,
[01:49:06] okay, cool. Now we're, and we're doing things like what you do in the seal teams. Guess what? If,
[01:49:11] if Andy and I are on a pistol range and we're shooting together, like, he's going to be making
[01:49:15] for me, right? I'm going to, I'm going to shank some round off or whatever. Need a mag change in the
[01:49:20] middle of what I did need. I'm going to do something stupid. Yeah. And he's going to, it's going to,
[01:49:24] it's going to be fun. And you know what? It's going to make me better. Yeah. It's going to make me better.
[01:49:29] And that's another thing I noticed at tack like the amount of that's that we're up there. Yeah.
[01:49:34] It's freaking awesome. It's awesome. And guys coming up to me and telling me like, bro, you know,
[01:49:41] I started this. I started this. This is what I'm doing. And these are guys that freaking, you know,
[01:49:46] two years ago, whatever when they got out of the Marine Corps after six years or after eight
[01:49:51] years or after 18 years, they didn't have a mission anymore. And now the sun, they're freaking
[01:49:57] jacked up. They got their gear on. They're showed me their freaking range finder and they're pumped,
[01:50:03] man. They're pumped. Yep. And so the fact that you've sort of opened up this opportunity for so many
[01:50:11] guys to start going down the path, it's, man, it's so beneficial to dudes. Yeah, that's freaking awesome.
[01:50:19] And it's, there also comes a point in time where you want to like, I'm fortunate that I can pick
[01:50:24] and choose what I'm doing right now. And so I really want to pick and choose things that's
[01:50:30] rewarding to me. And hopefully that's not, you know, selfish. But there's also like,
[01:50:36] I don't know, there's, there's people that I work with where I know this person could live on
[01:50:43] this planet a lot longer because they have a new focus right now. And, you know, in artories
[01:50:50] change their life totally. And what's cool about it is, you don't have to be in like perfect physical
[01:50:58] shape too. So I mean, there's times where people get into artry and they're kind of a little bit
[01:51:02] lost, you know, maybe, you know, maybe they're not as in shape as they were or whatever. But
[01:51:09] that's what's cool about it. It's, it's not age specific. And it's, you know, if you can pull it back,
[01:51:15] you can do it. And I think the natural progression is you pull it back and, you know, maybe you're
[01:51:21] not good. And then you get a little better. And then, you know, there's a ton of people now that are
[01:51:26] just for a better food source alternative, they're open-minded to hunting if it's, you know, in their
[01:51:33] minds fair chase, which, you know, bow hunting, you know, kind of lowers that boundary for people
[01:51:40] to where they're like, okay, if I'm going to put in all this work and do it, I'm totally cool,
[01:51:45] you know, eating this thing or killing it or whatever. But then once you take that step, you realize,
[01:51:51] oh, this is a whole different kind of hard because now you're dealing with, in my opinion, some
[01:51:58] of the animals are just so much smarter than other things you could roll up on it, murt and, right?
[01:52:05] I mean, they're freaking cute up, you know, because I remember, uh, Andy and I were on something
[01:52:14] where it was, it was, it was a pretty tough, like, yeah, it was kind of a little bit of a miracle
[01:52:20] that we pulled off this stock and jack something I don't know what it was, but I remember saying, like,
[01:52:27] you know, doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to kill a person, he's just like, dude,
[01:52:33] because it is not this hard at all. He's like, he goes, all of us would be, he's like, you know,
[01:52:46] he's like, a lot of us would be, you know, at a totally different level if we had to learn this way first.
[01:52:52] He's like, it, he goes, if, if everyone had this background prior to going into the team,
[01:52:58] he's like, it would be, he would be insane. No, it'd be very beneficial, very beneficial.
[01:53:05] There's so many things that you gotta think about that are the exact same, you know,
[01:53:09] well, with elk, the only thing that's not the same without this smell, like, like,
[01:53:14] and although if you talked to some of the Vietnam guys, they're like, oh, the VC or the NVA would smell you.
[01:53:20] Yeah. And so if you can make it smell like that, and they could smell them, too.
[01:53:23] Yeah. So maybe we need to just account for everything.
[01:53:25] Well, now with dogs, like, what I told Andy was I said, listen, you know, if I knew there was someone
[01:53:31] coming to jack me, you know, I would definitely have at least a dog, you know, I've definitely have
[01:53:37] dogs around, because obviously dogs could smell too. You know, if you train them on something,
[01:53:42] you know, specific type of gear or something like that, it would be an advantage. But I've actually
[01:53:48] talked to, well, one of the guys that we're with tonight, he's actually hooking me up with some of the
[01:53:56] guys that are going to do some of the training down in Lenni for this sniper training.
[01:54:02] They're doing a couple of team things there, and so he had asked me if I wanted to go down just to
[01:54:07] to teach some navigation of like, instead of learning the long distance aspect to like make some
[01:54:16] competitions on the closest shot to where they, you know, to where I would assess their choice of
[01:54:24] that navigation and like what they could do different to where it's like, okay, we know how far you
[01:54:30] can shoot something from now, you know, who can jack something at a guard or whatever, you know.
[01:54:36] Yeah, it's totally different to have to get within, you know, 50 yards to something. That's just
[01:54:43] freaking crazy. It's crazy to think that way. Whereas with a rifle, you know, you can be, I mean,
[01:54:50] at least 500 yards, you can be 500 yards and be like, you know, we're good. I got this.
[01:54:57] So we went surfing yesterday. At least, yeah, we went surfing yesterday. And I was 10
[01:55:04] pause. Well, actually, no, I paused for a second to think to myself, did he surf or not? And the
[01:55:11] fact, the matter is you did surf. You did surf. You paddled on the waves. You caught the waves and you
[01:55:16] stood up. That's why I paused. It's like, wait, did he surf? Yes, you did. You caught multiple waves.
[01:55:21] You paddled into them yourself. And then you stood up and rolled the waves. That's what surfing is.
[01:55:26] So you did, we did surf yesterday. And I know you'd only been one other time, which was, the last time
[01:55:32] you went was was a little bit more. At the pier. Yes, at the pier. And it's a, it's a much more
[01:55:38] forgivable sort of like easier step. Like we were yesterday, that's like you can't push yourself
[01:55:45] into those waves. You can't touch the bottom and be like, oh, I got this. You have to actually
[01:55:49] surf. We're reserved yesterday. You actually have to surf. But when we were, when we were going out,
[01:55:54] who with Josh? And I was sort of like, you know, I'm just going to let Josh. Because like, I,
[01:55:59] I don't want to, I didn't want to be telling you things and Josh telling you things and you're
[01:56:03] sitting there, if we can got two people telling you shit to do and it just too much, right? So I was just
[01:56:07] kind of do, I was just kind of going. And man, as I was going down, there was like,
[01:56:14] before we even got in the water, there was 97 things I wanted to tell you, like, hey, man, you
[01:56:18] got to watch out for this, this thing over here, this path over here, you got to watch here's the line
[01:56:21] up. Here's where the, here's where the, the channels are like, this is where you want to sit. Here's
[01:56:26] what you want to watch. I like, like, I'd 97 before we even got in the water. This before we got in the water.
[01:56:31] And I'm not, you know, if you're at a, at a freaking black belt level in archery, like, I'm not,
[01:56:40] that I'm not at that highest level of surfing. And I was like, man, imagine how many things were going
[01:56:45] through your head. As you're watching me, like a freaking monkey with a damn bow just thinking,
[01:56:53] all right, with a 50 foot surfboard. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was just like the amount of things that
[01:56:59] that that you don't know about surfing, the amount of things that I don't know about archery and
[01:57:05] about hunting and about scent and about terrain and about the way the freaking animals react to this
[01:57:10] and different animals react a different way. And there's like so much to learn. It's freaking crazy.
[01:57:17] Yeah. It's crazy. It's hard as a coach because a lot of times you forget more than you,
[01:57:24] like you don't know what you should be talking about until you realize like, oh, oh yeah.
[01:57:31] And you gave me like, there was several of those yesterday. Yeah. Like, worst one was what you told me
[01:57:36] when we were on the deck, like watching. We were like watching. You're like, yeah, I meant to tell you
[01:57:42] when you were like, see how all the waves are coming in right there, like off that set. Like,
[01:57:48] that's why Josh and I when we were done, we would go around those to like loop back and he's like,
[01:57:54] you know, you just kept going straight back up the gut. Yeah. And he's like, I was just waiting for
[01:57:58] that board to like freaking T-rex your face. I mean, while I'm like, bro, that would have been
[01:58:05] something like when we were standing up on the top, looking down. If you would have said, like,
[01:58:10] hey, you see how all those waves break like this. So when you get your set and you ride that out,
[01:58:17] you know, looping behind that. So you're not like freaking how does full blown like do a bud's
[01:58:22] training? Oh, there's a sacred moment. Freaking hand freaking like eight minutes. What I've
[01:58:28] done with me, oh, he's an easy in the impact. Oh, just get hammered. But, but you did get up like
[01:58:36] while we were surfing, you know, you did surf and and to me, that's a testament to, you know, like
[01:58:41] being athletic and being being able to actually, you're really your first day out to go
[01:58:48] paddle into waves and stand up. That's not easy to do. Now, Josh Hall did make you a freaking
[01:58:54] basically an aircraft carrier of course. It's freaking massive. 11, 6 and it's like over four inches thick
[01:59:05] and 24 inches, which anyone that's a surfers here in these numbers going damn, that is an actual
[01:59:11] aircraft carrier. But that's what a perfect platform. And plus you're how much do you weigh?
[01:59:17] 240. Oh, yeah. Like that's a different level. You need a big ass board. And it looks like
[01:59:22] you echo Charles. Yes, sir. What's up with your surfing career? Oh, minimal at best.
[01:59:28] We'll say. How come? I don't know. There's no tangible reason. I mean, I guess if I search my
[01:59:35] soul, you know, I did body boarding sponging as it was punching, you know, for the most of my
[01:59:42] adolescent life. And then, yeah, how did you not, but how did you not, like, say, oh, wouldn't it be
[01:59:48] cool to stand up on this thing and ride this wave and glide through the ocean?
[01:59:54] Yeah. I don't know. It's just one of the things. You know, like, where I grew up on the
[02:00:00] south side of Kauai, they're actually not there's surfing, but I grew up at the beach, like,
[02:00:05] literally grew up at the beach. And then again, you're saying this, like, this is some sort of a
[02:00:10] weird way that you wouldn't be surfing. But you're like, no, no, no, I grew up at the beach. No,
[02:00:16] exactly. But if you're wrong with you, if you understand the progression, just naturally
[02:00:21] kind of growing up there, you go, you're swimming, you know, in the baby pond at Playable Beach.
[02:00:25] And then you're like, okay, then you're kind of body surfing a little bit, then you're
[02:00:29] booky boarding body boarding sponging, you know, also that. And then, yeah, it's exactly, I think you
[02:00:34] start to go surfing. And there's a, there's a, how should I say, a geographical element to it as well.
[02:00:41] You're literally in the baby pond, then you're outside the baby pond. And then the surfing
[02:00:45] waves and the surfing spots, those are out. So you always see the surfers, but they're way out.
[02:00:50] So I get maybe I think when we started getting into football and stuff, it's like the beach
[02:00:55] started to be less and less. And then we just never, I don't know what I never did.
[02:01:00] Are you thinking if I get an investment for a second? Yeah, step. So like, you're going to have to
[02:01:05] get out, like you said it, where you want to be as a little bit further out. You know, that's where
[02:01:10] the good stuff is. It's best to crush and all her work out like 45 minutes before you first
[02:01:17] day. Yeah. Well, that was interesting, too. So like we get in the water.
[02:01:22] What have been surfing before? Right. Yeah, never. No, but I'm, I was, like, I'm talking to
[02:01:28] Doug and I'm like, bro, I've been on hunts with him. Like, I'm watching him move through the forest.
[02:01:33] And he's just like, you know, freaking 14 foot legs. And he's just stepping over, like,
[02:01:39] he's stepping over small, like, yeah, like small trees and stuff like this. And I'm,
[02:01:44] I'm like, dude, you know, and then watching him shoot, I'm watching him shoot a ton and then like
[02:01:48] hook a football or whatever. I'm like, yeah, this guy's a great athlete. And so I'm thinking,
[02:01:53] we're going surfing and I'm like, okay, you know, he, and I said, man, you're going, I was,
[02:01:56] I told you this. I go, bro, if you're long arms, you're going to just be like, bro, and this
[02:02:00] big board, you're going to be, you're going to be like a freaking, you know, a cigarette boat,
[02:02:05] just going through the water. So we'd go in and I, like I said, I wasn't doing any coaching.
[02:02:10] I was just kind of leaving that Josh and I get in the water and I start paddling out and then
[02:02:15] I look back because Doug was going next and then Josh was doing sort of like cleanup, right?
[02:02:19] In case something went sideways and they're probably going to get in. So then I see Doug, like,
[02:02:23] okay, he's good. He's in and then I start paddling and I'm not like racing, but I'm just paddling out.
[02:02:28] But then Josh comes up next to me and I'm like, well, that's weird. I want to wear
[02:02:32] dudas. So I'm paddling a little bit more and I look back. So now it's been like probably
[02:02:36] one minute and 30 seconds. Maybe I look back and as soon as I look back, I see Doug and he looks like
[02:02:43] he's just like, they got into a freshly natural repair. Like, oh, yeah, because here's the thing.
[02:02:52] And you brought this up to me a long time ago, echo Charles. If you're not used to it,
[02:02:57] that's like, if you're not used to it, it doesn't matter. Look, it matters and if you'd
[02:03:02] weren't in good shape at all, then it would really suck. Yeah. But if you're not used to that
[02:03:07] little particular muscle group and the technique, because you're in the water and there's balance
[02:03:13] going on and yeah, it takes a little bit. Yeah, they're true. I mean, I was laughing at myself because
[02:03:21] well, first off, I didn't know like where we were going, because we were, we were, you're going to
[02:03:28] be surfing sets, right? That would further out. You know, I don't know where it was, probably
[02:03:33] won't say, because I know you have your spots. But so my first experience was we walked out from the
[02:03:40] pier and like where stuff was breaking right there. That's where I was surfing. So when he kind of
[02:03:47] jumped off the rock and went out there a ways and I was talking to Josh and Josh, like, yeah,
[02:03:53] just get where you're comfortable and launch out on your board. You know, wait for a smooth spot and
[02:03:57] jump out. So when I did that by that point, Jocca was like 100 yards out. So I thought like,
[02:04:05] he's where we were going to be waiting for these waves. So I just went like full sprint for like the
[02:04:11] first 30 seconds and then Josh, like, as I'm like kind of starting to burn out, you know,
[02:04:17] that freaking Josh is like strokes by and there just go and then Jocca was just looking back. He's like,
[02:04:24] got to go about 200 more yards and I was just thinking like, for MD. Like,
[02:04:31] for, bro, I was going into like, I was, I was saying this kind of stuff like, bro, you got to
[02:04:35] give me like two minutes of hard pattern. I was in that moment. You know, like two minutes and it's
[02:04:41] over. It's a kind of out because you were just kind of in the lineup, like not going to start
[02:04:45] using the impacts of the reason. And all of a sudden, there's a wall and I'm like, because now
[02:04:49] I'm reading now, I put everything together by my mind. And I'm thinking if this, if this brother
[02:04:54] doesn't get out there, like now he's going to be in here for a long time. So I'm like, you got to
[02:05:00] give me like two minutes. Give me like two minutes of work. It was, I put, see, I love like, I love
[02:05:06] that. I love something that, you know, it's just to me struggle gives you, it like gives you a purpose.
[02:05:16] You know, today, when we were waiting to come here, I just sat out there and watched those things.
[02:05:20] And I was like thinking about every mistake I made yesterday and how I would do it differently today.
[02:05:26] Paddling was one of them. But like, even yesterday,
[02:05:32] Choc has like, hey dude, you know, just hit the garage where you work out. So I went down in there and
[02:05:37] it's very different than mine. You know, so I'm kind of looking around, looking at the, you know,
[02:05:42] the tools trying to figure out like what I can construct, you know, that day. So I freaking, you know,
[02:05:49] hit his rings for a while and stuff and and did some kettlebells. But then I also thought like,
[02:05:55] you know, a lot of it's like freaking gorilla movements. So he, you know, his wife and girls had some
[02:06:04] bands over on the side. So after I, you know, slung some kettlebells around for a while, I, you know,
[02:06:11] went and grabbed some bands and just did some like burnouts of, you know, shoulders and, you know,
[02:06:16] freaking arms and stuff, which I thought was, you know, I worked out for an hour. I was pretty
[02:06:22] happy with, you know, everything. But like, dude, at like 100 yards out, freaking trying to
[02:06:30] paddle that aircraft carrier. And he's like, 200 yards building, you got it. And I was just like,
[02:06:37] oh, like, freaking dry sets. You know what I said, you later, we got back. He's like, he's like,
[02:06:42] yeah, you know, bro, I mean, I just realized for the first time that like when you see a surfer,
[02:06:47] that guy's in like better shape than a wrestler like he's in sick. You got to be in the sick
[02:06:52] ishap because that's how hard it was. In a way, but also not a way, let's face it. You can be like a
[02:06:57] fat old dude that serves like I'll take you to, yeah, they're just used to and they got good
[02:07:02] technique and they just go out there and they don't even, you know, they don't even freaking try
[02:07:06] in there. I was like, when I give a bodybuilder, you know, a bow and watch him like,
[02:07:11] struggle to get it back and you're like, dude, this is a 70 pound dumbbell row right now. And you
[02:07:17] can't do it. You know, and then because, yeah, is that that they don't have like the, the little
[02:07:23] stabilizer muscles or something? It's like, no, it's just like, it's just the understanding of like
[02:07:28] the technique of like where you're pushing and pulling and like the leverage of it. It'd be like,
[02:07:33] you know, it'd be just like walking up and even if a big dude, you said like, you know,
[02:07:38] hey, do a clean and jerk and you just like put 200 pounds on there. You do, I mean, it's just going to be a
[02:07:42] train. Right. They don't have the technique. Whereas you get a little female that knows how to do a clean
[02:07:48] and jerk. Yeah. She'll take that 200 and throw it up like it's nothing. I'll be talked about that on the
[02:07:53] maze today. We're talking about that. What the swinging one? Yeah, the big maze. Yeah, that for surfing,
[02:07:59] yeah, you're right. Like actually, you don't have to be in that good shape. You just have to be
[02:08:03] used to because it's so repetitive. Like just patdling it so repetitive. It's like not knowing how to
[02:08:08] swim. Honestly, like on that board, I just felt like, you know, the first time, even if someone
[02:08:16] knows how to swim, you throw them in the water. If they don't know like stroke and like how to
[02:08:20] block and breathe and you're like taking on water in your mouth and you're like trying to blow
[02:08:24] that out and yeah, you know, you're freaking sprinting when there's waves up like and it was like
[02:08:30] simple stuff. You know, I got my first ride in. I think I was on my like I went up to one,
[02:08:36] you know, one then got up to one foot for a little bit and then like as I'm going back out, I'm just,
[02:08:41] you know, taking freaking, taking the straight line straight out and I did that a couple times
[02:08:49] and then I'm out there with Josh. And Joshua would rode one in. I'm out there with Josh in a couple,
[02:08:55] like a big set came that were crashing kind of further out and like as we're going up, he knew it was
[02:09:01] going to like crash and he goes, he goes, bro, when you go up, he goes, do a push up on your board.
[02:09:06] Right as you're hitting the right as you're hitting, you know, whatever you call it, you know, the
[02:09:10] flake or what do I want? Yeah, he's like, you know, do a push up on your board and then it drives
[02:09:14] and goes down and you can just ride the back and I like that freaking wind up this thing. It was like
[02:09:18] and rode down and I'm just like, now you tell me dude, I freaking was taken like full endos,
[02:09:26] just freaking one after another in the freaking mortar zone, just taking heavy artillery,
[02:09:34] Josh going Josh or just out there like, watch me just like, you know, he'll be back, he'll be back
[02:09:39] out here 15 or whatever. There's a lot of technique. Man, he told me the, you know, the buttonhook method,
[02:09:49] the channels. Yeah, like, once the channel, we got all the way out and climbed up on the rocks and
[02:09:55] we were there to take a picture of the three of us like up at the top of the cliffs and he goes,
[02:10:02] see where all those are breaking, he's like, yeah, that's how it allows you. He goes, that's why
[02:10:07] I like, I'd ride it out this way and then I'd come in around the back and then Josh, you know,
[02:10:12] how Josh always rode out that way and then he'd come around the back and he's like, you just kept going
[02:10:16] right up the minute. I was like, man, you think you've tell me that like 10 minutes in,
[02:10:24] it's another time. You know what? As you said, there's like only so many things, like the 97 things
[02:10:31] that I wanted to tell you or that Josh wanted to tell you? Yeah, that just didn't make the chart yet.
[02:10:36] And then once you once we realized that, okay, he's going to be able to survive, then that made it
[02:10:40] onto the freaking, onto the prioritize and execute things. Don't just sit there in the impact zone and try to
[02:10:45] pat it out. Um, hey, so I'm going back to the business side of things because again, to me,
[02:10:54] that's one of the, that's what makes it's applicable. Well, that's what makes your story applicable
[02:10:59] in so many different realms is the, the business side and the way you've set things up.
[02:11:04] You ended up eventually kind of like, I don't know if this was your, your final move,
[02:11:11] but not it's not your final move, but your one of your biggest moves was partnering up with with PSE.
[02:11:18] Yeah, I mean, that definitely came later, but yeah, I mean, there came a point where
[02:11:23] our business had grown a really awesome community that was, you know, thriving for the educational
[02:11:31] content and then also like products that supported that educational content, which was all, you know,
[02:11:38] Sharon's side of the house. I was more, you know, I come up with things to talk about based on
[02:11:44] someone I'm working with at that time, but yeah, the brand became a community, you know, it became,
[02:11:51] you know, Sharon always said like, we're not, you know, we don't have fans, we have, you know,
[02:11:56] we have a community like we have, you know, we have a knock on nation. That's kind of what we
[02:12:02] referred to it probably five years ago, you know, five or six years ago, which we just turned 10 years old.
[02:12:09] So, you know, halfway through we realized, you know, like what really fit our model.
[02:12:15] And then yeah, one of the hard things for me, one of the hardest things is, you know, I'm a very
[02:12:22] loyal person, you know, and I've since I've also been, I've worked internally at manufacturers,
[02:12:30] I look at, you know, ambassadors or external representatives in a different light than, you know,
[02:12:38] if someone just outbearing an ambassador, you know, or public figure, whatever, whatever, you know,
[02:12:44] it's way different now. But when I was internal and we had pro staff, you know, you just,
[02:12:52] you see what people do that really helps the company and makes you like never in question of
[02:13:00] should we get, you know, who are we going to keep around this year? I just knew those types of things,
[02:13:06] you know, to where if it was, it's just like with for me, like with my friendships,
[02:13:13] if it's a two-way street, then, you know, that's a good relationship. But if it's all, if it's always like,
[02:13:19] you know, there's always a given a take, then, you know, that's just not like a healthy relationship.
[02:13:25] So, from like, like you built me a bow, you taught me how to shoot, you took me on Hanson,
[02:13:29] and then I broke your neck. That's a good relationship. Yeah, that's how I'm looking for it.
[02:13:34] That's exactly what I'm looking for. Yeah, a lot of people don't know that like,
[02:13:41] when you are here doing the podcast with Andy and Trevor, that was day one of jujitsu for me.
[02:13:48] And I was actually in this room. I just couldn't talk because my neck was broken. I was over in that corner,
[02:13:54] just trying to get oxygen, freaking pull my ass off his off the back, neck bone.
[02:14:03] Meanwhile, you and Andy are just frigging laughing. You're laughing.
[02:14:06] Okay. I'm just like, okay. It's your little thing. Yeah, it's all right. So, we form these really good relationships with the two
[02:14:14] waste street, just like you and I got. Yeah, and so it's always been tough when, when you change, you know,
[02:14:21] when you, if you change brands because I don't ever want it to be a reflection of loyalty but a lot of times,
[02:14:27] A lot of times like the higher up you go in what you're giving someone or what they're
[02:14:35] giving you.
[02:14:36] There's obviously there's just more expectation and there's more, you know, I don't
[02:14:41] know, it's just like the higher up and rank you go.
[02:14:44] There's, you know, there's things that you need to do better than other people.
[02:14:50] And so, you know, when you climb to that spot, it's, sometimes it's hard when you get to
[02:14:54] a higher level to then change because I don't ever want it to people to feel like I'm
[02:14:59] just making a change from a monetary point of view.
[02:15:04] But for me, I had gone through two consecutive contracts that were multi-year contracts
[02:15:14] and both of them kind of got cut when our business is projecting, you know, in this format,
[02:15:21] but then, you know, they're like, well, you know, we're kind of plateauing from a marketing
[02:15:25] point of view and, you know, we're not getting added budgets, but we need to make room for
[02:15:30] other things.
[02:15:31] So they were always transparent, but it also became clear of, you know, we're
[02:15:36] projecting up and I want to, I want to provide more free content, but I can't provide
[02:15:41] free content to the consumer if I have no support from, you know.
[02:15:46] By the way, when you say your trajectory is going up, you mean not on archery is growing,
[02:15:53] you're getting more and more people following, there are more people watching your
[02:15:56] instructional on YouTube.
[02:15:58] There's just a whole new archery pie, like, you know, people within the archery community,
[02:16:04] that pie would be like, you know, local surfers around here probably, you know, that's probably
[02:16:09] a pie.
[02:16:11] Because if someone just really started focusing on, you know, teaching surfing to people
[02:16:17] like me, you know, and I came in, they like start this whole other thing to where these
[02:16:23] people all over here are probably looking at like, what's this guy even doing?
[02:16:26] You know, why is he doing that?
[02:16:28] The reality is, you know, we're kind of like baking a whole new cake because the people
[02:16:34] that we're getting from the military and, you know, the people that we get from a lot
[02:16:38] of our mutual friends.
[02:16:40] Like I'm beyond busy just with our, just with people that we know should be getting an
[02:16:47] archery, right?
[02:16:48] And at the end of that contract, my last one, I kind of knew I need to open my ears to
[02:16:58] everybody because I had been with that company for 10 straight years, but I also had taken
[02:17:04] six years of, you know, to where things were plateauing and I could see there wasn't progression.
[02:17:11] So I listened to everybody and yeah, I mean, through everything, there was honestly there
[02:17:16] was multiple deals that were better than where I was, but PSE came in and pretty much
[02:17:23] said like, we love what you're doing and we want into support what we're doing, but we
[02:17:28] also want to give you the tools to where if you want to do more, we'll give you the tools
[02:17:32] for that. So they said, you know, if you feel like you want to create a bow that's specific
[02:17:37] to, you know, to your followers or if you want to do something and I said, well, you know,
[02:17:42] can I bring in a bow that's like at a budget price, you know, and they just said, yeah,
[02:17:47] you tell us what you want it to sell for, you know, we'll assign an engineer to you and you
[02:17:52] can, you know, you can do whatever you want. So it was just, it was just a different door,
[02:18:00] you know, that got opened that allowed us to go a direction with our brand that I feel good about
[02:18:08] and I feel like, you know, I sleep well with just knowing that we're giving back a lot.
[02:18:15] And yeah, PSE's been a huge part of that, you know, they've just given me the tools, you know,
[02:18:20] the first bow we came out with is the one you and I shoot and then came out with another bow
[02:18:26] that was focused on, you know, a price to where either average person can go and get into archery
[02:18:33] with a really good set up, but probably still less than what you could buy a surfboard for, you know,
[02:18:39] I mean, and then yeah, we can choose our direction. So it's been an awesome partnership and,
[02:18:46] you know, there are an America, you know, everything's made in America for the stuff that,
[02:18:51] you know, we're designing and it's just, it's really cool because it's actually the company.
[02:18:57] My first bow was a PSE and last year was their 50 year, like anniversary.
[02:19:04] So, and PSE started in Illinois, like very close to where that road that I turned down was not very far
[02:19:12] from there. So there's just a lot of cool things like that that, you know, a lot of times
[02:19:17] if things are meant to be, they happen, you know, I've just learned that, you know, if you
[02:19:23] for stuff, it's not for the right reasons. So I've, I've just really, I've been fortunate that I haven't
[02:19:31] had to make a decision based on, like, I can't pay my bills if I make this decision.
[02:19:36] So I've always just let things unfold of, you know, really what's meant to be will be, and, you know,
[02:19:43] and I feel like I feel like my progression of shooting tournament archery and learning what I learned
[02:19:51] there and learning the connections and growing up, working with the manufacturer and seeing some
[02:19:57] of that behind the scenes stuff. Like all those were just sacrifices and building blocks that I had
[02:20:04] to do to get to where I really want to be. You know, I never, I never wanted to be the best
[02:20:09] tournament archer and never really wanted to be, you know, I didn't want to just work at an archery
[02:20:15] you know, manufacturer or, you know, go to all the, the shoots. I just, I love hunting. I love
[02:20:22] teaching, you know, I like, I like going to new spots and seeing new things and having new challenges.
[02:20:28] So, you know, that's kind of what it's done for me. Yeah. And what I like about it and I remember
[02:20:33] as this deal was unfolding. You were telling me what it was like and it's like, it's a true partnership.
[02:20:37] Like you said, you're allowed to go in there. You can help design exactly what it is you want.
[02:20:44] It's your name going on these on this equipment. So it's like you can't be any more invested
[02:20:51] in this company, which is, which is awesome. Yeah. And what the other thing too is
[02:20:57] everyone needs to remember, you know, if you can't shoot it well, there's no purpose to it. So like
[02:21:03] through that whole process, I got equipment from all these companies that I really hadn't done,
[02:21:11] hadn't done a lot of due diligence shooting to where I, you know, because I had only shot
[02:21:16] two other archery brands really at from a like professional level, each one for about a decade.
[02:21:22] So I shot other competitors to know what they felt like, but that doesn't mean I knew what they
[02:21:28] would do like in my hands every day. So I needed to know that. And right away after three or four
[02:21:36] days, I thought this is a seriously underrated product, you know, and I went out there and met with them
[02:21:45] and they talked about a lot of things that they wanted to do, especially like at that 50 year,
[02:21:50] you know, they wanted to, you know, make some changes from the sales point of view. They wanted
[02:21:55] to make some marketing decisions that were different, you know, they said, you know, we want to be
[02:22:00] able to to hit some like niche markets, which for them our community was a niche market, which I think
[02:22:08] was very underrated, you know, now now I think they realized, you know, what the impact is.
[02:22:16] But yeah, it really gave the ability for me to take people that had incredible ideas internally
[02:22:23] and in awesome patents, which, you know, for me would be hard to go out on my own and do it
[02:22:31] because I'd have to work around so many things that now that I've shot their bows, I personally like.
[02:22:37] So, you know, I would be trying to figure out a way around what they've solidified as a, you know,
[02:22:45] as a proven design. So it just, it was a, for me, it was a plug-in play. Like, and that's what,
[02:22:51] it had to be because, you know, we've worked really hard, Sharon and I, to, you know, really
[02:23:01] stay on our path at knock on our tree because there's, there's been a lot of opportunities to, you know,
[02:23:07] maybe, I don't know if sell out would be like the term because it probably wouldn't be that drastic,
[02:23:13] but we could have definitely made a lot more decisions that would have put our following secondary
[02:23:20] to decisions that we made and the PSE collaboration was a, was an awesome plug-in play for us.
[02:23:31] And I think as a, especially me, I feel like I was an athlete that built a career out of
[02:23:40] the discipline of athletics, honestly. I feel like those are the little things in business, you know,
[02:23:49] especially now, like so many people build business based off social media or, you know, maybe they've,
[02:23:57] you know, maybe they've been with the origin for, you know, using your guise for a year.
[02:24:01] And you guys have been good to them and you're laying down foundation to get to where you
[02:24:07] want an origin to go, but then, you know, brand Y comes in and says, well, you know, we're not just
[02:24:13] going to give you a discount on a guise, we'll give you a guise. And, you know, I was always at the,
[02:24:20] the mindset of, okay, if I get a guise to it, one, do I really need to get a free guise, if I've got one,
[02:24:28] even though I had to buy it for moregen, you know, and okay, let's say I take the free guise.
[02:24:35] Well, now I've, like, also started a brand new relationship. So, you know, I think we made a lot of
[02:24:41] really good choices by weighing out, like, long-term relationships that understood the direction
[02:24:50] we needed to go, but we weren't there yet, but they were going to help at a rate that they could
[02:24:55] to where we could get to our goal versus, like, you know, a lot of startups or the perfect example of,
[02:25:02] like, you know, they make a lot of dumb decisions as I did as a business, you know, given stuff
[02:25:09] away to the wrong people, and those, those places come and go all the time, and I think as like an
[02:25:14] and, you know, an ambassador type figure, whatever, you can, I think you can be like the
[02:25:20] call me influencers. That's where hashtag influencer. Yeah, which, yeah, that's your official hashtag
[02:25:26] for any night. But, yeah, you can, you know, you can burn a lot of bridges, and it's just my experience
[02:25:34] that a lot of these, you know, jujitsu, surfing, archery, they're like, they're small demographics,
[02:25:43] they're like small ecosystems. So, it's like, there's only so many times you can burn a hole in the
[02:25:49] freaking ozone before, eventually, people are like, that dude just burn in the planet down, if, you know,
[02:25:56] yeah. What I like about you, what you guys, what you and Sharon have done,
[02:26:00] and I think this might be the biggest lesson that I look at you to try and pass on to the people.
[02:26:07] As you guys have done the right things for the right reasons a little time. You have put the
[02:26:11] customer first, you put the clients first, you put the people that are watching your videos.
[02:26:16] I mean, there's, there's, well, that's what you've done. That's what you've stuck to,
[02:26:20] making the best products you can, trying to get them at a good price point. I mean, for you to go to
[02:26:24] PSE and like say, okay, I could make one their bow, you know, and this super high end bow,
[02:26:31] but you went there and the first really, I guess the second movie made, because you did make that
[02:26:36] first bow that we're shooting, but then you said, okay, here's the first move. We're going to make a bow
[02:26:39] that is affordable to people that still kicks ass. So, I think one of the lessons that I take away from
[02:26:46] this is like, if you're doing the right things for the right reasons, in the long run, strategically,
[02:26:52] you're going to be better off than, you know, trying to, trying to maneuver real quick to make a
[02:26:57] little bit of a buck here in a buck there. Like you said, you're burning a hole in the world that
[02:27:01] that you have to live in and it ends up not working out well. I hate to ask you this, because
[02:27:09] I've, you probably been asked this 10,000 times, but look, we've been going for two and a half hours or
[02:27:15] something like that. But if someone is starting, if someone's like, hey, dude, this sounds awesome,
[02:27:20] I want to get into this. I want to get an archery. I want to get a bow. I want to, you know,
[02:27:24] what, I want to go hunting. I want to be freaking stalking around in the forest with Kami Paint on my face.
[02:27:30] Like, I'm in. I want to get into it. What, what do you recommend? How do you, how do you go about that?
[02:27:36] Well, I think first, you should just, you know, Google, you know, Google archery shops and look at
[02:27:41] ratings. There's, you know, some areas are very fortunate to have in an awesome archery shop that,
[02:27:48] you know, has amazing, you know, entry level, you know, classes and programs like that.
[02:27:58] But also, like, especially from our point of view, knock on archery.com is, you know, we offer free,
[02:28:06] lessons and content. I just put out a series, you know, archery 101 with, you know, Mark Shanker from
[02:28:14] Kickspan because you and I are both were like freaking hairstylingers from the 80s.
[02:28:19] You're thinking of late babbin. Late babbin was a hairstylinger. Was not me. I wasn't listening to freaking
[02:28:24] poison like you were. I'll give that to you, bro. Hold with you, God. You know, you do.
[02:28:37] You know, offense against kicks, but they weren't in my freaking tape deck.
[02:28:42] What was your top three for a black Sabbath motorhead, Led Zeppelin, ACDC, and then just
[02:28:50] straight into all the hardcore stuff that I grew up on, Chrome Mags, Bad Brains,
[02:28:56] Ignostic Front, right on down the line, who wants something?
[02:29:01] Well, if you wanted that easier listening, you had alternatives. But, uh, no, we did, I just thought
[02:29:08] it was a really cool story because, you know, he's, he's later in life, decided to pick up
[02:29:15] jujitsu, you know, went down that path, you know, wanted to honestly wanted to like get away from
[02:29:21] factory farming. And so, decided to go down the archery path and, you know, wanted to like get
[02:29:27] good enough to where he could, you know, get his own food. So to speak, so it was really cool.
[02:29:33] And we documented that and that's, you know, it was like a three-part series, which takes someone
[02:29:37] from who had never pulled the bow back and just walked him through, like, you know,
[02:29:45] same thing I did with Helen, right? You know, and saying, I didn't know anything about our tree.
[02:29:52] You, again, man, so thankful that you decided, like, hey, you, you are going to really like this.
[02:29:58] Because you heard me on Rogan and you're like, this guy needs to get a freaking bow. So you said it
[02:30:02] up, you came out here, freaking, like, what did they say? Like, it's not going to come you on a silver
[02:30:08] platter, right? In life, things are going to come to you on a silver platter. I literally got
[02:30:13] archery on a silver platter. And I know it to everyone out there that's like this sample,
[02:30:17] bitch, just had freaking doubly build mabo and then teach them. Like, that's what happened. I know,
[02:30:23] I'm sorry that I got that freaking lucky. You know, my buddy Jack Manels at S. L. I'm front,
[02:30:28] you know, Jack. But he, he's like, man, he's like, he's like, man,
[02:30:33] done the touch of how to shoot, man. He's like so freaking pumped. So I know that I know that I got that,
[02:30:41] but one, but I, I didn't even watch in your videos like before you came out to teach me. And so then
[02:30:47] immediately, I go home and I'm like, all right, what are these videos that he's talking about? And I'm like,
[02:30:50] oh, that's literally just what he told me to do. And he was like, I went through and I'm like,
[02:30:54] oh, this is what you, so anybody that's thinking, I got so lucky. I did. I'm not taking that away.
[02:31:00] But you can get just as lucky by going to press and freaking play on a YouTube video. And you're
[02:31:05] going to get, you said the exact same things to me. You're like, hey, this is what you need to do. Here's
[02:31:09] we start. Here's what this is. Here's what this is. And I'm like, okay, cool. And I'm doing it.
[02:31:13] Then I go home and watch the videos. I'm like, that's what he just told me. He could have just sent
[02:31:15] me the YouTube link. You have to fly out here to say, yeah, you go. So every, the, the fact that
[02:31:21] you've given access to your actual program of coaching and it's available to anybody.
[02:31:28] Yeah, it's available to anybody. So, and on our YouTube channel, you and I pair a lot
[02:31:33] each other in that format. Like, and I heard you talk about it in the past. You've talked about,
[02:31:41] you know, like, you know, for extreme ownership, right, when you first started doing it, and you
[02:31:45] would, you know, probably when you started, you would get cash by going in places and doing that
[02:31:51] presentation, which is kind of like when I used to travel Europe. And like my slide shows, you know,
[02:31:58] if people took pictures of them, it kind of weirded me out. Like, I need to be booking, you know,
[02:32:04] I need to book another spot. That's how I'm paying for my bills, you know. But then it gets to the
[02:32:08] point where you realize, no, actually the more people you're helping, the more people that want to
[02:32:15] dive deeper. So, you know, there came a point for me where I kind of knew I was going down the right
[02:32:24] road when people that were on higher levels were getting mad at me because they're like, don't show
[02:32:31] them how to do that. You know, why are you showing them how to do that, dude? You know, and because
[02:32:37] the US was so dominant in archery competition for a long time in the compound both category,
[02:32:44] and so like learning that ranging system on the unknown things, like, you know, that was never
[02:32:51] telling you one, that sort of thing. But just all these small little things, you know, we'd go to
[02:32:56] another country and see them like punching triggers or something, you know, my buddy, look at me,
[02:33:01] like, you freaking talk to them about punching that trigger. I'm gonna punch you in the face.
[02:33:04] You know, let's freaking do these people. So, but yeah, I just felt like the more I gave away,
[02:33:15] it's also a really good filter because you really start to see how many people are absorbing what
[02:33:21] you're saying, and not, you know, not being an asshole, where they're just asking and they never
[02:33:26] apply, ask, never apply, never apply. You see people where you look at them and you're like, oh,
[02:33:32] hey, man, when did you start shooting that silver back? And they're like, yeah, I watched, you know,
[02:33:37] video blah, blah, blah, and I've been working on it. I think I'm getting better and meanwhile,
[02:33:41] I know this because I'm seeing, you know, what I tried to teach being applied by someone that I know,
[02:33:48] I didn't directly tell it to. So then naturally, it's like, well, hey, let me give you a little bit,
[02:33:54] you know, let me help you progress, progress this a little bit. And I feel like, um, for you and I
[02:34:01] both, you know, we just got to the point where we realized, lay it all out there. And yeah,
[02:34:09] there's, there's certain places that we'll say, Dudley will give you anything to come out here and
[02:34:15] like do it in person and blah, blah, blah. And yeah, I've got people, you know, we've auctioned a
[02:34:22] couple of bows that have gone, you know, for a lot, for good, always for a good cause,
[02:34:27] but we auctioned a bow that went for a lot for the Navy Seal Foundation to get to that million
[02:34:35] dollar, March to a million mark. And, you know, even though it was a raffle, you know, people still
[02:34:42] well, you know, not everyone's got 20 bucks to buy a bunch of raffle tickets and it's like,
[02:34:48] you know, you can't make everyone happy, but the reality is, you know, if someone really wants to go through
[02:34:54] and put it all together, they can, you know, they can read all these and, you know, so many different
[02:35:03] things that I've heard you talk to people, you know, and give them, I don't know, you people will
[02:35:11] come and be like, hey, you know, Jock, go give me some advice about this. And then, you know, go through
[02:35:16] and look in here and I'm like, oh, yeah, well, you know, I've heard them apply that exact thing
[02:35:21] and they acted like, you know, he just told them something this never been said and it's like, actually,
[02:35:26] if they would follow that, like, you know, I'm a broken record when it comes to archery, I've,
[02:35:33] I've boiled down a recipe to, you know, what I feel is like a balsamic glaze. It's like,
[02:35:41] they're good stuff, you know, and I know like what can make most archers who are brand new be at a very
[02:35:50] high level fast and eliminate a lot of mistakes, but, you know, whether you watch every video I have
[02:35:58] or read all those articles or you come in person. Now, granted it's easier for me to see in person
[02:36:04] if I'm breakdown, which that is the benefit to be an in person. You can directly connect, like,
[02:36:11] right away, you're not having to figure out what am I doing wrong and research it, but other in that,
[02:36:16] like, we put it all out there. If I learned something new or if we come out with a new product,
[02:36:23] then, you know, we're, we're going to put it out there. And most of everything we do is always,
[02:36:28] it's always a derivative of a need that I see that we can help with. And I remember specifically,
[02:36:40] like, on that bow that we were talking about, I have chalkboards all around me, like,
[02:36:46] you've been to my house and stuff. Most anywhere where I, if I sit down and I'm in there very long,
[02:36:53] there's chalk, you know, most of my walls are just painted with chalkboard paint,
[02:36:58] because I just write stuff down so don't forget it. But I remember, like, meeting this person
[02:37:05] that kind of said, like, hey, I'd loved to embark on an archery journey where do I start?
[02:37:10] And so I remember writing that down, which is the name of that bow is embark, because I'm, like,
[02:37:16] you know, embark on your first archery journey, embark on your first bow hunt, you know.
[02:37:20] So a lot of the things that we put out there are because there was a need, you know, my subject matter
[02:37:29] comes from someone's problem that I need to help them fix. And I've been the subject of that a
[02:37:34] few times on social media, like, hey, it's starting looking at Jocco's shot, he's doing this.
[02:37:39] And I'm like, there you go. And it's awesome, you know, and that's the way it should be. You know,
[02:37:43] it's funny is, what's not funny, but probably like the third podcast that we were doing,
[02:37:49] maybe the fourth, something, but very early on in the podcast. I remember I had been asked a question
[02:37:55] about leadership, and I was going to give the answer. And I was like, this answer that I'm about to
[02:37:59] give is like very, very, very valuable. And it didn't, it wasn't like I had a major debate in my mind,
[02:38:08] but it was more just an acceptance. It wasn't like I said, maybe I shouldn't give it away.
[02:38:12] But it was more like I said, when I give this, this is given away something very, very valuable.
[02:38:18] And that's what I'm going to do. Like maybe there's a little bit like, well, you know, because I
[02:38:22] look, I have a leadership consulting company. Yeah. Right. That's what I do is I do leadership consulting.
[02:38:28] If I'm just, you know, hey, go ahead. I'm just going to give away all the answers for free.
[02:38:33] Well, maybe that's not a good idea. And if I had that thought, it was like I split second.
[02:38:38] And I realized it was like, no, actually every possible thing that I can give to people to help them,
[02:38:43] that's what we're doing. That's what I'm doing. And, and that's what you do. And like you said,
[02:38:47] what it helps is that solves, look, no one in life is going to get to the end of their problems.
[02:38:52] Right. No one's going to get to a point where they just like, oh, I don't have any problems
[02:38:55] anymore with leadership. Right. Oh, I've got everything figured out. No one. And so there's, to
[02:39:00] you solve a bunch of their problems, cool. Think, that's what. Now when you work with them,
[02:39:05] you can do a problem. That's actually a little bit more complex. It's actually a little bit more
[02:39:09] challenging. You know, like, I get kind of like you get asked, hey, Doug, you know, sometimes I hit
[02:39:18] a little bit low to the left. And they're thinking that that's the first time you've ever been asked that.
[02:39:22] You know what I mean? Or they say, hey, you know, once I'm sitting on a target, I start to, my hands
[02:39:29] start to shake a little bit. Like they're thinking that this is only happening to them. You've been asked
[02:39:32] that question 15 million talkness, right? And happens to me too, like, you know, hey, Jocquat,
[02:39:37] I know you talk about cover move, but sometimes people are working with, they don't really,
[02:39:41] you know, they don't want to do their part. So how does that even work? I've been, they think that
[02:39:45] that's the only time that's ever happened. And it's actually happened 15 million times that I've been
[02:39:49] asked that question. So give it away. Give away as much as you can to people and that
[02:39:56] elevates everybody. And that means they're, they're seeing value in what you're doing and they're appreciative.
[02:40:01] And now, guess what? They get their problems. That problem solved. Cool. If they never have a problem,
[02:40:06] again, that's great. Cool. That's great. Good for them. That's awesome. I'm happy.
[02:40:11] Someone else is going to have that problem. I'm going to learn, by the way, it's just, it's just
[02:40:14] if it's doing the right things the right reasons. Like I said, if you're doing the right things,
[02:40:17] the right reasons is going to pay off in the end. You and I are really similar in a lot of ways, like,
[02:40:22] you know, right now, sharing an I are staying, you know, in your old house. So just lurking around and
[02:40:30] seeing some of your stuff. I mean, you're, you're not like a gadgety person. You're like, even
[02:40:40] your weights, you know, the first one you got at eBay or where you know, before eBay, when you
[02:40:46] walked in the freaking second win fitness or whatever, freaking bought this rustile for a thing you got.
[02:40:52] But you, I don't freaking old. What you do. Everything you do is that way, but I'm glad you knew
[02:41:03] that the bands you used to work out were not mine. They were my wife's and daughters. But I think
[02:41:13] your consistency with like, you get good at the tools you have and you build yourself around
[02:41:22] those tools. You don't get tools to try to continue to make you better. You know, you're not like
[02:41:28] looking for the cheat code looking for the cheat code. Yeah. I know you talk about that for a hack.
[02:41:32] Like, well, this, if I get this, it'll make me a little bit, it'll make a little bit easier.
[02:41:36] Now, I'm glad we're not talking about surfboards because you also saw my mama surfboards on
[02:41:39] which is kind of rigging ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah, surfboards is like a freaking junkyard of surfboards all
[02:41:47] over the place. Yeah. And there's a little bit of an excuse for that because different waves
[02:41:52] require different boards. Yeah. There's a lot of different waves to surf. I mean, my artier
[02:41:57] room looks very similar to that. But I don't change unless there's a change needed for the application.
[02:42:03] Now, one of the things with me is I never really had great continual coaching. A lot of the
[02:42:10] things that I teach are from mistakes like no one ever told me why I missed low left. I had to figure
[02:42:17] that out over a lot of frustration. And so like once I've learned those things, everything I
[02:42:24] boiled down is to try to help eliminate those mistakes and learning curves. You know,
[02:42:30] shouldn't say it's cheat codes, but just like me, freaking surfing yesterday, I do try to take a
[02:42:37] direct line of tech. So my coaching method is very direct line of attack to where you're
[02:42:47] eliminating mistakes, but like getting to that particular point of topic as efficient as possible
[02:42:55] to where you're not expanding valuable energy in that artri shot. I just want to make sure we capture
[02:43:04] a couple things here. So I'm never done artri before and I want to get into artri. What's we
[02:43:10] we look for a good artri shop, we read the reviews, what's a good amount of money to spend on that
[02:43:16] first investment is it better to go and like, hey, should you go and try like, hey, can I try a bow?
[02:43:22] Like, let me shoot some suit. It feels like in the shop, just to just to make sure you're like,
[02:43:26] oh, yeah, this is freaking cool. Or is it like, you know, spend a thousand bucks, spend 800 bucks,
[02:43:33] what's going to get you in the game? Well, I think if you go there and you try it, most artri
[02:43:38] shops are going to let you try it a little bit. I think that would be valuable and be really
[02:43:44] specific to them to where you're new. You want to make sure you buy a equipment that's very
[02:43:50] suited for you as a beginner. And one of the examples of that is when you buy a bow, they have like,
[02:43:57] you know, they all have pulling weight. So when you pull them back, you know, it takes a certain
[02:44:01] amount of strength to pull them back. I'm real strong. Yeah. I want 500 pounds. Yeah, that's
[02:44:07] Jocco walking in. But a beginner like our wives, for example, if they went into a lot of shops,
[02:44:15] some shops, especially if they were excited and just wanted to buy it right then, they would
[02:44:21] make do with equipment that they have and like size it down for them versus I would weigh rather
[02:44:27] say, hey, I'll wait a couple weeks to order something to work. You know, it's my pull away the bow
[02:44:34] is the right size for me because they can always make it work. But you know, getting the right
[02:44:39] equipment off the get go and being upfront with them of, hey, I really want to do this. I enjoy it.
[02:44:46] I want the right equipment. And it's my personal belief that if you get in on like the lower and
[02:44:53] stuff, you're going to, you can progress really fast with our tree. So what'll happen is you're going
[02:45:01] to do it just a short period of time and realize I'm actually better than this beginner piece of
[02:45:07] equipment and then you realize the value of beginner equipment is kind of a poor investment because
[02:45:15] it's just you're going to sell it for way less because everybody got that cheap entry point.
[02:45:22] So like with the bow that we did the embark, that bow allows you to get a bow at a price
[02:45:30] to where you can put some really high indexes or he's on it because the accessories can carry over.
[02:45:35] It'd be like, you know, if you went and got a, you know, a cool freaking AR but then like
[02:45:43] you, you know, shot your wallet on buying that thing. So then you went, you know, you went and bought
[02:45:48] an abeski and then you're like, well, I got 50 bucks left and you got to borrow your buddies like
[02:45:54] red rider, bevy got like scope that came on it to like put on your abeski. That's going to be a
[02:46:01] problem. So I tell people, you know, get high indexesaries, get, you know, quality arrows, high indexesaries,
[02:46:08] get a bow that's in the middle of the road to where if you move up in that bow, you can transfer
[02:46:14] your accessories over which, you know, we've done with you, you know, we can transfer the accessory.
[02:46:19] I went high end on your accessories because you don't want accessory, like you don't want your
[02:46:24] site moving, you know, if your, if your site's moving around or if your arrow rest is moving around,
[02:46:29] then there's none of us that are going to know how well you're really shooting because
[02:46:33] there's just continual variables. But I think I think for a thousand bucks, you can get in to
[02:46:41] where you can get in and stand without having to re-up and re-up and re-up. But you want something
[02:46:48] that has the ability to, especially if you're still growing, you want to have a cam system
[02:46:54] that and that's kind of the pulley looking things on the bow, you want to be able to have
[02:46:58] something that's adjustable. And especially when you're learning like as a coach, I'm not going
[02:47:05] to be hypersensitive of you being exactly your drawing, which is like your posture when you're
[02:47:14] at like a full drop position with your bow pulling it back because you can pull a bow back to
[02:47:19] different lengths. There's a good chance that your technique is going to slightly change over the
[02:47:25] course of getting better to where you might need to make some adjustments with that. So having
[02:47:30] something that has the ability to adjust is also awesome, what you get when you spend. It's kind
[02:47:37] of like, I think there's like $100 increments like you can get a bow for 400 bucks, but you're
[02:47:42] going to be limited, you know, and then I think once you get to like $699, $799 for the bow
[02:47:49] only, you're in a really good position and then put good accessories on it and you'll be enjoying it
[02:47:56] for that level bow, like the embark, like you go on haunt with that thing. This is, yeah, I'll
[02:48:05] shoot one day at the tax, we'll be with an embark and then one day I'll be with an Indian. Like
[02:48:12] in last year, I took that bow, you know, on one of my most memorable hunts, you know, because I've
[02:48:20] always, that's one thing I've always done is I want people to feel like even though for a
[02:48:26] particular brand, they have a low-end model, a mid-grade model and a high-end model. I've always
[02:48:32] put some of those budget bows to a test and I've used them because I want, I don't want people to
[02:48:38] feel like they can only shoot archery if they have the best gear. I've proven time and time and
[02:48:44] time again that that middle range is a very good place to get in and you can honestly, you can stay there
[02:48:54] and be totally okay but, you know, it's no different than, you know, there's a lot of cars that are
[02:49:01] awesome but, you know, I like my ram but I might want that hellcat ram. Even though technically
[02:49:10] drives the same. Right on, well I think that's that's good info and I'm sure a bunch of people
[02:49:18] to probably good, yeah, we're approaching three hours right now but I just wanted to make sure
[02:49:23] people are going to get interested in this. I want people and by the way, you have all this
[02:49:27] information on your YouTube channel about like, wow, to get started, what to look for,
[02:49:32] everything from freaking arrows to the book, like everything. So it's, it's all out there if you want to go
[02:49:39] a little bit deeper but, yeah, man, obviously I appreciate you coming on but, man, I appreciate,
[02:49:47] I appreciate what you're doing, what you're doing for veterans, you know, that are out there,
[02:49:52] what you're doing for your whole community, people that are making their life better because
[02:49:55] they're out there, they got a mission and absolutely what you've done for me helped me out delivering
[02:50:02] silver platter, bow hunting to me, which again, I'm sorry for everyone for being so spoiled.
[02:50:06] I'm lucky and I appreciate it but, man, it's been awesome and I want to help get other people
[02:50:13] heading down that path because I mean, I think it's beneficial in so many different ways, man.
[02:50:17] Yeah, it is 100% I think it's an awesome and awesome sport, especially for people that come from
[02:50:24] your background who are looking for a new mission, you know, you set it perfectly because
[02:50:30] with all of you guys who have done it, you know, learning a new discipline or a new trade
[02:50:39] is one thing but then once it comes to like packing up to freaking go on call,
[02:50:47] that lights a whole different intensity where, you know, hey, we're meeting, you know,
[02:50:53] we're out at dark, back at dark and when you're out there, you know, geared up and freaking
[02:51:02] ready to get after it, you know, I remember the first time you and I went out and we were on that
[02:51:08] hillside, glass and you just said, bro, this freaking, this is a recon right now, like, you know,
[02:51:16] I'd have a team right over there, there'd be freaking two dudes right there, they'd be like,
[02:51:21] you know, back up and then we'd be here and like, you know, the shit would be all pulled over
[02:51:26] tight, you know, you were in your element just dorking out. Yeah, well, you were head freaking
[02:51:34] dork on the center, also, it's awesome man. Echo, Charles, you can see what kind of
[02:51:41] focus and consistency it takes to approach excellence in any element cognitive focus. But the
[02:51:52] pursuit never stops, the pursuit of excellence does stop, what suggestions do you have?
[02:51:58] Oh, well, I was moving in there, right, you know, we talked about being an athlete,
[02:52:04] right, the importance, the value of being an athlete, which I was with you the whole time, I
[02:52:09] agree fully, but we don't want to stop that just because we get older and take on other
[02:52:13] responsibilities. Are you getting older? Well, that's got a sock. It's just one of those things
[02:52:18] man. The life I live nonetheless, we got to stay in the game even on our off time. There's no
[02:52:25] off time on time. There's just time. Something like that, unless we have things to help you through
[02:52:30] this journey supplementation. First thing, you talk about focus, we have discipline.
[02:52:34] I was able to look at you just to get you on track, because you were starting to stray.
[02:52:39] Whatever you go, those are talking about all this. I can probably chime in on a few things,
[02:52:44] because I can tell you like three things that are pinnacles for me from, you know, from origin,
[02:52:52] cold war, freaking joint warfare, and the vitamin D, and freaking have powered through
[02:52:59] COVID, you know, COVID year was like no factor. No factor, but those three for me are every day.
[02:53:09] They're like right next to my cup of coffee, where I know I'm getting after it first thing in the
[02:53:14] morning. Yeah, that those are freaking legit. The joint warfare is,
[02:53:20] the Go-Reeder Reviews on Dr. Warford, don't listen to me. Who am I? I'm free. I own the company.
[02:53:25] Of course I would take you good, right? Go read the reviews from other people,
[02:53:29] and what it does to them, and what they say that grandma started taking it. Now,
[02:53:33] of the sudden, you know, she's whatever playing tennis again, and whatnot.
[02:53:38] Yeah, true. But this is the whole purpose, yeah, you own the company.
[02:53:43] Oh, but the whole purpose that you have this stuff is because that was like your pursuit even before
[02:53:49] that. True. Like, yeah, you got to take this stuff, real oil, you know, all the ingredients, you know,
[02:53:53] and then, well, you added some ingredients to the joint warfare. That's not too big, that's bad.
[02:53:57] Because why not, like, it's not like, all I'm just going to take, no, make it better.
[02:54:01] Make it the best possible thing that you can put into your mouth to make your freaking
[02:54:06] joints bulletproof, son. Yeah, true. And I'm with you with that combo every day. The
[02:54:13] cold or not is much that that's kind of a seasonal thing. Don't like the cold super
[02:54:18] curl too. Get that curl oil on, man. Get them little fish down. What if they fish? No,
[02:54:23] little shrimp. Little shrimps. Little tiny shrimps. Fish well. Good to the. Yeah,
[02:54:29] maybe want to look good. Fish oil is good. Yeah, you're right.
[02:54:31] Chuck, there's some label here. I will say something. If it's in there, he's read it and
[02:54:37] researched it. There's a reason that we see fish oil is like whatever. That's your freaking
[02:54:42] $400 bill. Yeah. Kriola is the entry or the Kriola is the freaking top of the line.
[02:54:48] It's the top of the line. Super curl is where it's at. I understand fully.
[02:54:54] I mentioned the discipline this one go. Hey, look. Some of us are into energy drinks,
[02:55:00] but really we're not into energy drinks. We're into the idea of energy drinks. And what they don't
[02:55:04] tell you about the whole energy drink thing is that there's poison inside. Straight up normal energy
[02:55:10] drinks. Yeah. Tradish. Tradish. That's why. Yeah. So this is the upgrade. This is the, I don't know
[02:55:15] whatever you guys call it. I think you know, I don't even think it's an upgrade. I think it's new category.
[02:55:19] Yeah. It's new category. It's like, oh, we're over here drinking poison. You're over here drinking
[02:55:23] something that's awesome for you. Clean alternatives is like a long overdue category for
[02:55:30] because think of how many guys went in and got after it in victory and then walked out and just
[02:55:37] grabbed dog crap in a plastic bottle to like have something on the way out the door. Yeah.
[02:55:44] It is way past you. Yeah. Way past you. Yeah. It's almost like, and I'm not as in touch with it,
[02:55:52] but I'm a casual, we'll say, but it seems like the whole energy casual. What? It's, I mean,
[02:55:57] besides life. Everything. What all of the above. You said you're a casual. What are you talking about?
[02:56:02] You know, energy drinks before you see, if it wasn't for me being on deployment, like
[02:56:07] with with energy drinks and needing them because I need this like, hey, I'm freaking wicked tired.
[02:56:14] And I've been awake for 48 hours and I need caffeine into my system. That's why I started drinking
[02:56:19] energy drinks. And then, but what do you deal with? You deal with, oh, I got done drinking the
[02:56:24] energy drink. Now I don't have that way freaking out for anymore. And now I feel like dog shit.
[02:56:30] Yeah. Yeah. And that's exactly what I'm trying to do. There's a bunch of junk in there.
[02:56:34] This exactly what I'm saying. You're talking about like, what about you in the club?
[02:56:39] What about you and you and freaking door man of the year or whatever?
[02:56:42] I never, I never, I never, I never got into energy drinks as much. You know, every once in a while,
[02:56:49] whatever, I just drink coffee because they have coffee available. Oh, whatever. It's for a
[02:56:53] stain up. No, but I'm talking about like activity. You're talking about going on deployment.
[02:56:57] All this time. I don't like the taste of coffee. Okay. Yeah. I understand. Sure. I was talking to Evan
[02:57:02] and Evan's like, bro, I want to get bring up to Utah and I'm going to figure out what
[02:57:07] coffee, you know, what coffee like there's, you know, there's got to be a way. You know, he's like a,
[02:57:12] he's like a, a Somalia of the Java being. Right. And he's like, I want to create it.
[02:57:18] The job. He's texting me. He's like, yeah, he's like, he's a commissar. Man, we're going to get you
[02:57:23] the, you know, the the been that you like and the roast that you like and all the stuff.
[02:57:27] I texted back, I go, bro, I don't even like coffee ice cream. Good luck. He's started laughing.
[02:57:33] But that's kind of an important factor right there because coffee like coffee's like beer,
[02:57:38] where it's like at the end of the day, you're always going to have the beer flavor. There's a beer
[02:57:42] flavor. But there's a coffee flavor. And then from that flavor, they, it was a different
[02:57:47] ride. Or what I wasn't able to taste in that coffee wouldn't be coffee. Exactly. If you made it with
[02:57:51] freaking cocoa beans, it wouldn't be coffee. Yes. Right. If you made it with tea leaves, it wouldn't be
[02:57:55] coffee. Correct. Yeah. Exactly. Or strawberry, so whatever Evan was trying to put on your
[02:58:00] flavors. We'll see. I don't know. He's a freaking, he's into it, man. He maybe can pull it off.
[02:58:05] We'll see. It's chocolate peanut butter. You might be a little bit. That's like you with
[02:58:10] milk, bro. Like I sent you like a whatever. You got some milk and then like two weeks later
[02:58:14] to look him or one. You're like a freaking cracker. He's probably the one that's
[02:58:18] milk of the new man. That was that dude. All right. We'll give you three days and that freaking
[02:58:23] ball. Yeah. It's true. But the energy drinks is like a lot of these activities that they're
[02:58:28] sometimes in my observation, which is limited I know, but in my observation, it's associated with
[02:58:34] these activities that are kind of, let's just say they would benefit more from a healthy,
[02:58:40] oh for sure. For sure. For sure. Yeah. Why would you be doing something that's physically
[02:58:44] demanding and putting poison in your body? So you okay, don't do it. You go to big sky,
[02:58:49] whatever. You know that hill. You're always sending me videos of you guys charging and whatever. What's
[02:58:53] it called? The big. I don't know what's a mountain. Yeah. Of course. What is that called?
[02:59:00] This is called. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, when I ran up that thing after you and I were like,
[02:59:05] kept walking down that mountain every day and be like, Panister be a good workout. Why when
[02:59:09] when I went and did it, I was like, you're up confirmed. That sucks. Yeah. And that's what I'm saying.
[02:59:13] So, so then you, we write the lift up there. Okay. So in the snow, we'll say,
[02:59:18] if you really used to it, okay, good. But just being in the snow, just like just being in the ocean
[02:59:25] or on deployment or in the woods, part of my lack of terminology, but it is just, it is woods.
[02:59:33] Okay. Just being there, bro, it's like that's in and of itself is a thing.
[02:59:38] Like you can't, you're not just cruising, you're just working. Right. So you're okay. And then
[02:59:42] you're doing your activity on top of that and whether you're in big sky, you know, the woods,
[02:59:46] water, whatever, like, you're gonna, you're not gonna want poison in that scenario right there.
[02:59:51] No, or even anything that you're gonna pay the price later or something like that. And it's not needed.
[02:59:55] You don't need to. You don't need that poison. And that's why guys did the good stuff.
[02:59:59] And now, hey, wow, wow. If you want this stuff for you on the east coast, go to wow,
[03:00:03] and, you know, they were saying, they tried to pull the reins on us. They're like, don't tell
[03:00:09] everyone to clear the shelf. Stop, stop saying the back. We're back. See if you can run that
[03:00:15] supply chain into the ground. I challenge you all to see if you can run that supply chain into the
[03:00:19] ground for me. See what happens. If you do, well, figure something out. I'll do, what's something
[03:00:23] I could do? Like make a funny hat put on a funny hat and do a video or something.
[03:00:29] Grow those bangs back. Go on. I'm free to value that haircut back. That ain't happened.
[03:00:36] To me, to me, to me, hair, it's bothersome to me when my hair is like a quarter of an inch
[03:00:41] longer than ever. Like it already bothers me. So go on that distance. Would freaking drive me crazy.
[03:00:47] Unacceptable. Yeah. But did you do every job? Yeah, vitamin shop. And there's a subscription
[03:00:53] scenario. John, you don't want to run out of that that that every day supply, you know,
[03:00:59] jockelfuel.com, which by the way is where you're going to go. I think they call the good good.
[03:01:04] What's the good good? That's a subscription. Oh, yeah. Well, here's the old man. We're not,
[03:01:10] look, we're not alone in the world. There's good good. There's capitalism out here. We're competing
[03:01:15] on an open market. We're competing with some people that are pretty big. So when you compete with
[03:01:20] people that are pretty big, you've got to figure how you're going to make something happen. So what
[03:01:23] we want to do is free shipping, right? Because people are very used to free shipping.
[03:01:27] Because there's some companies out there that do free shipping. And so how can we make that happen?
[03:01:33] The way we made it happen is if you get subscriptions to any of these products, the boom,
[03:01:38] shipping is free. There you go. All right, cool. Also, origin USA.com. Okay, this is where you can get
[03:01:43] American made stuff from jujitsu stuff all the way down to non-jujitsu everyday stuff and like
[03:01:49] for real, everyday stuff. Like jeans, like jeans, like all that. Boots, boots. Yeah, still wait.
[03:01:55] Number hat, Pete, which hat, a bini, a ball cap? No, that you know the one that he wears. We both
[03:02:02] were that one. What do they call the flat cap? Those are called a flat cap. But they're like,
[03:02:06] kind of the French one. Yeah, it's called a flat cap. It's not like a fedura. No, it's called a flat
[03:02:12] cap. It's like what you see like a little British dude wear. Do I Andy got me one in France, a
[03:02:18] camo one that I wear sometimes. And it's made out of ammo flat cap. Hell yeah, dude. Oh, glad you.
[03:02:25] And it's made out of like sweatshirt material. And it's freaking comfy on your head. I hunted with it.
[03:02:31] I told Pete like, make me that out of my origin hoodie material. Because that hoodie's like the
[03:02:38] my favorite thing I wear around the house every day. Oh, yeah, that thing's freaking. The freaking
[03:02:43] midway, that soft ass one. It's freaking awesome. Right. You used to say it most comfortable
[03:02:49] sweat suit every and makes. They make pants to match that. Yeah, that are like longer than
[03:02:55] 28 inches. Or yeah, you got to get a situation. But we'll sew two pairs to
[03:03:01] better. You're freaking long as legs. I heard the hour I saw they had some socks.
[03:03:07] Bruney. Yeah, socks are bruney. We're gonna make everything. Interesting. You make everything.
[03:03:11] Everything. We're bringing it back to America. We're gonna make it so you can wear it. And
[03:03:15] we will make it. Like they're making all these different like cool socks. But at some point,
[03:03:19] I'm just gonna make straight up white socks like you know I roll. See, you have a lot of good
[03:03:24] ideas. You do that one. When are you gonna make a jock strap? I don't know. You need to make a
[03:03:32] jock strap. That's a good call, man. That's a great. That's a great one. I've been here in
[03:03:40] that joke since I was in third grade. Well, for good reasons. But yeah, good. Yes, all American
[03:03:48] made stuff. Really good. Also, Jocquas store is called Jocquas store. And this is where you
[03:03:52] can get shirts and rash guards and hoodies and hats and stuff. That are represented of the path
[03:04:00] directly. And then there's the shirt locker. Which is how this is what savages people want to.
[03:04:05] Yeah, by the way. This is what, this is how savage people are. So we have this thing called the shirt locker.
[03:04:10] Yeah. It's, it's a subscription. And if you're on the subscription, you get like a one-off
[03:04:15] t-shirt. Like if you have to be on, you like, you can't go buy it later. So somebody's actually
[03:04:21] think a couple people are already jacking the designs. I don't even know how to say that. It's not
[03:04:27] like that design is like on this place. People, people posted it. People posted the real one.
[03:04:32] So like, and then they, then they jack it and they put it on these websites. Like, hey,
[03:04:37] it's freaking ridiculous. But it's how savage people are. It is savage and it is lame. But it's,
[03:04:43] there's like a few, you told me that they only use the word savage in a negative way. But I
[03:04:49] know, I guess we're using a positive way. Yeah. More off, I think you just, you just more tuned to it.
[03:04:55] Because I say it with such disc like those just, that's just, what a savage. Yeah. When, when somebody's,
[03:05:02] like, doesn't have the creativity to figure out how to make a cool t-shirt and sell it instead,
[03:05:07] they're just savages and just stealing a design. Yeah. What, who does that? Yeah, it, it's savages.
[03:05:15] Now what's jacked up is you could also be like, oh man, like, you can, obviously be super positive
[03:05:23] thing. Like, oh, like you said earlier, you're like, hey, where the weed of twins are from,
[03:05:28] where the weed of brothers are from, there's a bunch of savages in their neighborhood.
[03:05:31] They're wrestlers in their fighters and I was like, yeah, cool. I totally knew what you were talking about.
[03:05:35] Yeah. So it's one of those words that can go either way. But that's a compliment word.
[03:05:39] We've had many conversations where if Jocco says savage, it's, it's a high compliment for someone
[03:05:47] that doesn't know they just got one. It is a weird thing because I use it as the highest,
[03:05:52] one of the highest, one of the lowest insults I can give. It's literally the same word.
[03:05:58] That dudes a savage or that dudes a savage or a fucking bunch of savages. I don't know how they get the,
[03:06:07] the design because it's not like, okay, like the one, okay, so hard-core recondos are good or
[03:06:13] just when equals freedom. You go to like, I don't want to tell anyone how to, how to get it. But
[03:06:17] it's on display somewhere, you know, but the shirt locker ones, they tend, they're not.
[03:06:22] There's like a hint of them somewhere. No, but no, no, people are taking when they get their shirt
[03:06:27] locker shirt and they're posting it. Oh, they're posting it. Like, yeah, we've got the new shirt locker shirt.
[03:06:31] Oh, yeah, but okay, so how they, how they do that, right? The knockoffs basically
[03:06:37] the counterfeit pirated like design shirts. They go to one of these like internet, yeah, yeah,
[03:06:43] what he called purchase by the restaurant or whatever. No, you can do what he was, his whole
[03:06:49] bad it is if you know about it. And you can, if you just have like half a brain, no offense to
[03:06:55] people who bought those, but you can tell you look at it and it's like this weird like mock-up of
[03:07:01] the design on this real like real like like, what do you see in these, like, model? It's like when you
[03:07:07] buy a metallic a t-shirt like from some dude on the beach, yeah, it looks like there's like plastic
[03:07:12] stickers like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I feel bad about is, though,
[03:07:18] is I know that some people are doing like they're like, oh, cool, like I want to support because
[03:07:21] we're like, you like, hey, man, if you want to support what's going on here, then you get some
[03:07:25] get some gear. And so they can actually are stoked like, oh, cool, I'm helping out, you know,
[03:07:29] the podcast we're in the game. And then they realize they're giving their money to some freaky
[03:07:33] savvy, some freaking savage out there. Stop the savage support. Yeah. And they use like super,
[03:07:40] when I say substandard material, it's like, you know, it's like the internet shirt that you print,
[03:07:46] you know, it's like that, then they get that. And they're like, oh, not to mention, there's more
[03:07:51] to it than just that front design. There's a lot more to it. Oh, there's layers, there's little,
[03:07:56] there's little elements of the shirt if you examine it, you're like, okay, I mean the game with this
[03:08:00] shirt, even on a physical level, not to mention the fill, fill this off a cool level, and you don't
[03:08:05] get that either, man. It's brutal. Anyway, if you want, if you want to get involved with the shirt,
[03:08:11] locker or any of these other things, jugglestore.com. Also, we got, you know, you should possibly

[03:13:22] It seems like that guy is a pretty good reader. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I mean, some of these readers
[03:13:28] are just offensive. Like you listen to him and you're like, this guy is just picked this up for
[03:13:32] the first time. He has no idea what's going on. No context and he's just reading the words on the
[03:13:35] page. I thought that the first like hour, I probably thought, but then some of the things that he wrote
[03:13:43] reminded me of my grandfather so much to where now when I hear it, I hear my grandpa talking because
[03:13:50] he was he was gritty, you know, Korean word gritty and depression gritty. So like I'm hearing him
[03:13:59] tell it how it is and you know, and even like the terminology like he was a good man,
[03:14:07] that was classic, you know, that was classic pop up right there. He's like, you know,
[03:14:14] he was a good man or you know, that that that man's a coward or you know, he was like,
[03:14:21] there was a clear line. You were above it or below it. That was it. Yeah. Yeah. Hackworth. Hackworth
[03:14:27] definitely does that hackworth said this guy, the guys are either studs or studs. No offense.

[03:16:25] it's at knockonTV. Yep. What else? Sounds like YouTube. Knockonartary. Yep. Yeah, just instances not on TV.
[03:16:36] Okay, check. Wait. Twitter might be. Twitter is too. I checked in this morning and Facebook
[03:16:42] looks like that too. Echo, you got anything else? Well, yeah, if like I have kids that I want them to
[03:16:49] get in art into art tree, obviously you have you know, direction for that scenario. Oh yeah. Yep. No,
[03:16:55] same exact thing. Doesn't matter the age group, you know, look for a good shop. See if they have
[03:17:00] a good youth program. If not, then dive down the down the YouTube rattle or, you know, follow in social
[03:17:07] media. Try to give some type of free education, you know, if not every day, every other day.
[03:17:13] I mean, a lot of what I do is just trying to help the archery lifestyle and some form or fashion.
[03:17:19] Is there so I got my son, he's for a foe from Amazon. He, it's, and it's like perfect where he puts a lot of effort
[03:17:28] and then he can pull it back. So I remember pulling a compound bow. No, it's like four. Yeah.
[03:17:35] It's the kind where I pulled it back. I was like, oh, he might not be able to do this. And then what when he
[03:17:39] does it, he can do it. But what's interesting? It's you can suction cups or what's it, you know,
[03:17:43] nerve things or what's it you would? I would say a brothel. I don't, yeah, I don't know about all the
[03:17:48] arrow tips heads. But what is it? What does it, what does it, end of it may it looks, it reminds me of
[03:17:54] looks like, you know, the old school, like, you know, if you have archery class at school, you know,
[03:17:58] the thing, like it's, it's not sharp, but it's made to stick into something. Right. The blunt point.
[03:18:04] Yeah, like a bow. Yeah. But it has a little tip to it kind of nice. But you couldn't like cut yourself,
[03:18:10] just by scrap, just by scrap yourself with that. I don't know. But the question is, like, if I just
[03:18:17] buy a random bow like that, is that like a note, like should I not do that? Or is it, honestly,
[03:18:23] with kids that are that young, just let them freaking watch arrows fly and have fun. Okay. That is
[03:18:29] my mindset. A little back and let it rip. Keep them close. So, you know, I tell people, you know,
[03:18:35] kids like playing games that they always went at. So, you know, if you try to make your kids
[03:18:41] shoot a target at your distance, it's going to be problematic, you know, keep it. Keep a target
[03:18:46] big. Keep them close. If they see themselves hitting in the middle, they don't really make the
[03:18:50] correlation of, well, that target's bigger than dads or this one's closer. You know, if you're
[03:18:57] just like, all right, you know, you shoot for the gold. I'm going to shoot for the gold. Let's,
[03:19:01] you know, and if they're like, I beat you again. I beat you again. That's perfect scenario. Yeah.
[03:19:06] Echo Charles, we started talking about making a warrior kid bow. What do you think? I think
[03:19:11] that that's a great idea. Yeah. What age does kind of kid get like a bow that's freaking like
[03:19:18] a little pretty legit? I think probably by seven or eight, they can be going down the right path
[03:19:26] or you can teach some solid fundamentals and get something set up for them. The up, that's the
[03:19:32] warrior kid age too coincidentally. We might have to keep going down that path. Awesome. Do
[03:19:37] the anything else? I'm good. Right. Awesome. Well, like I said earlier, man, thanks for
[03:19:43] thanks for everything you've done for the archery community. Thanks for what you're doing for all
[03:19:47] the vets all over the place and and really, you know, thanks for what you've done for me. I
[03:19:51] know that you, like I said, silver platter, man, it's been freaking awesome. I appreciate it.
[03:19:56] And all you got back from me was a freaking broke man. And a freaking brown paper sack for instruction.
[03:20:04] Just fit. I think you'd nearly drown. I broke your neck and almost drowned you. I'm from the best.
[03:20:10] I'm just in the sad. He calls his friend, Joshua over to like give me a board. So I'm like,
[03:20:17] oh, man, this is freaking awesome. Like he didn't even like deliver the chair. He like had someone
[03:20:23] else made the chair in and then freaking just threw me into the fricking. See, super freaking
[03:20:29] watching me drown. See, we didn't get that 40 foot leash. That was my, my board wrap around my
[03:20:36] 15 times. Yeah. Oh, look, I'm not the best guy in the world. I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts
[03:20:45] back at me. Thanks for telling us everything you learned today. Like I said, it's not just about
[03:20:49] archery. It's about life. It's about business. This is about moving forward. And thanks to your dad
[03:20:54] and his service and and thanks to all the vets out there and thanks to the current service members
[03:21:01] out there around the world protecting our freedom when you get done with that mission, you're going
[03:21:05] to need a new mission. Check out some archery, man. It's good for you. And to the people out there
[03:21:10] in service, here at home to police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
[03:21:17] correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service and all the other first responders.
[03:21:22] Thanks for protecting us in our times of need and to everyone else out there. Just remember that
[03:21:30] bow hunting is like life. The wind don't come easy and you don't always win. You don't always win.
[03:21:40] But you still have to prepare. You still have to get the reps. You still have to go through the process
[03:21:47] and you have to keep going. Keep trying to improve so that you can get what you are after.
[03:21:56] And until next time, this is John Dudley, Enico and Jocco out.
