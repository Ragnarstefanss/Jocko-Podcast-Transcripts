and he's like, bro, he's like, if he doesn't like, just like, I don't know, I know, he lives like a man or he can't. Pete Pete talked about how you know you've used it I think you gave great examples and you've also seen dichotomy leadership dichotomy leadership available for your to right now if you want first of this do you know I was thinking about like extreme ownership the book and then that caromy leadership the book you know what that's like it's like you're watching movie major league We were in the cafeteria like one of the first days and he comes up to me and he's kind of got his head down a lot of business like hey, I was like hey, and I thought he's in a say something like it's great to meet you because that's you know my ego so lastly obviously thanks everyone in the military out there making sacrifices every day to literally keep us free and thanks to police law enforcement correction officers fire fighters board patrol paramedics and all other first responders here at home thanks for your sacrifices to keep us safe and everyone else out there you know someone at the immersion camp said that jiu jitsu could seem frustrating because you try things and they just don't work and you practice and you drill and you try them again and things don't work and it said to person just said that jiu jitsu can seem frustrating and I said jiu jitsu just doesn't seem frustrating it is frustrating it is frustrating it's a grind it's hard it's overwhelming it's infuriating it's irritating and it can also be very disappointing and in all those ways jiu jitsu is just like life life is going to be hard it's going to be frustrating it's going to be disappointing he's extremely creative he designed a few a few things though like you've designed things like you he like actually drew it out really like draw no you never seen a draw But you know, there's occasions where like winning it all costs is like, it really is sometimes you're just like thinking, oh man, I have to, I've got a freaking do this, bro. remember you're like that took like two hours but the concepts are like kind of solid though seems like it's he understands composition and color theory and It's like on my way, like when I think about it, I'm like doing something and then, you know, wanting you're, I'm done doing it. Like if you're serious about training, like you're going to commit to it, like you're really going to commit to it. Yeah, it's like like when you get used to the milk it's like a kind of drink soda. and we did like a monster mash which is in the team's monster mash is when you set up just like obstacle course and then run and then a boat carry and just set up all these crazy things and they'll just do all these weird stuff and one of the stations was you had to drink a whole can of coke through a straw and then you had to like do a sprint over the Burma or whatever Right now I've just caught the fact that it's like the same is like be little like you're belittling somebody. Like if, if, if, if, if, if I, if I don't see the weakness and somebody exposes it, the first thing I do is feel like a schmock for a second, but then I'm like, okay, well, show me how I can get better. So like, I literally, and then I like, then, then I literally, I was like, he's got on brand. There's like, like, what's kind of like what I just said about what is me? It's like if you drink like a coke or a phanta in your case like right after training. Sometimes you've said to me, you said something that you would like to be like, I don't even know why I said that. Well, ego is like, if you want to, if you want to distill it, it's like, you know, there's no eye and team. and he's at origin on that phasy double watch and on those platforms echo is echo Charles and i am at jok work echo anything else but nothing super fun to have you on again thank you both i was you know little bit nervous about coming on today but i'm glad i did and that you forced me to know what i really appreciate you invited me back on it means a lot and man just awesome awesome to be able to share what we're doing with the masses and have you here at camp and you know helping out to build this movement. Like like individual moves or do you like to understand the broader concept? And I was like, dude, I said, you know, I said, I think the packaging were great, but you know what? They're drinking quick and so he like drinks it down and as he's drinking it you can see him like his initial face is like You know, like, we're, like, we work so well that we do work well together. If you have something that is, that is like that, that whether it's hey, I want you to charge, singa, nest, or whether it's, hey, I want you to continue to execute this plan, or whether it's, hey, I want you to even something like this. And really, I think this, I told him this, this conversation that we had made it, feel like it was worthwhile for me to come to camp because he said to me, I feel like, is it ever okay to quit? And I was like, yeah, you got to ask Jocco wherever she's like, oh, I just want that. it's going to give them directions going to show them the path and it's a it's a positive path it's a path that everybody would want their kids to be on and would want any kid to be on I don't care who you are you're going to want your kids on this path um extreme ownership we talked about it a bunch today you know And, you know, I know, like again with a single platoon, you want those guys to get done with a block of training and have pride that they did it better. There was actually one of the one of the girls here I was talking to her and she's all fired up and her brother she's like my brother's so mad he couldn't come and I said oh why couldn't he come she's like it's sold out. And it's kind of like one of those things you've got to balance, like, what's the most important thing here to make happen? I didn't know, I didn't actually know it was a, I just thought was like, I was the stop was that was me trying to mount you or pass the guard. And you know what's funny is when you know you, your ego is playing a role in your decision making is when you have to say something like this. But just now I just caught that like she little like, okay, it's be period little, right? Yes you know the agreement we had with the contract with the camp limitless to a certain amount but talking with the owner camp laurel he's like you we can expand more for you guys to make that happen because they they actually want us here because it's just great for them it's great for us I want to, I want to just give me an example of like, when you, because we're, now because we're doing what we, what we would do is like, we work so well together. So for the folks who didn't go to college and I don't even think, I'm going to say right out, like, I haven't said to my kids which college are you going to. And I, I just started calling people trying to find like, there was this mill in Sanford, Maine, a huge mill, like a million square feet. And then the electrical company, the electricians who were friends, also of us and they're like, they're like, okay, we got to bore through the concrete. yeah made sense all simple this I made it's this is part of a sticker that he cut off and put it right there so we both did that seems like okay that sticker that's not going to fit on my folder let me cut it off boom fits and you want it to be a shirt Peter Albert's artist composition one more time also And we follow him down this staircase and I'm like, this is going to like murder us or something. Like, you know a regular, I don't know regular, whatever. All I know is it was like, I think you're going to tell me hard attack. And we had like a tanky, you know, you know, Augustine, that was up here. It is like, you know, you know anything about this or what? But the thing is, they're not only, okay, so you have joggers, which I did, because if you do really jog in them, like they are, it's like they're ergonomically kind of made for actual jogging, because they don't flap on the bottom or whatever, and they give you room in the depth of difference between joggers and the sweats or something.
