1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel podcast number 198, but David Burke and me, Jockel Willick, good evening,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
David.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.40
Good evening.

4
00:00:10.40 --> 00:00:19.24
And David is back on the podcast because Echo is, well, he's still on vacation.

5
00:00:19.24 --> 00:00:27.000
And we are continuing the thread that we did on the last podcast with Andrew Paul,

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the last podcast we discussed day, German Field Manual called Trooping Fierong, which means

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
leading troops.

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.88
And I mentioned the American version of that document.

9
00:00:41.88 --> 00:00:47.88
It's called Field Service Regulations FM 100, 5.

10
00:00:47.88 --> 00:00:52.20
And the one, and this is a little bit, it's not that important, but I'm going to bring

11
00:00:52.20 --> 00:00:53.20
it up later.

12
00:00:53.20 --> 00:01:03.40
That we're going to talk about was published in 1941, so prior to the entry of us into World

13
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:05.08
War II.

14
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:10.12
And they plagiarized heavily from the Trooping Fierong.

15
00:01:10.12 --> 00:01:17.64
But there are enough differences in here that it does merit.

16
00:01:17.64 --> 00:01:18.64
It's on review.

17
00:01:18.64 --> 00:01:20.64
So we're going to look at it.

18
00:01:20.64 --> 00:01:24.36
We're going to explore leadership once again, Dave.

19
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:25.36
Are you ready?

20
00:01:25.36 --> 00:01:26.36
I'm ready.

21
00:01:26.36 --> 00:01:27.36
All right.

22
00:01:27.36 --> 00:01:34.36
Let's go to Field Service Regulations FM 100, 5.

23
00:01:34.36 --> 00:01:37.24
There's actually a little intro section in here.

24
00:01:37.24 --> 00:01:45.28
And it goes like this, preface on 22 May 1941, the War Department published a new version

25
00:01:45.28 --> 00:01:49.000
of FM 105 operations.

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.36
This manual superseded the superseded attempt of 1939 version, which I actually have not

27
00:01:54.36 --> 00:01:55.36
seen.

28
00:01:55.36 --> 00:01:56.84
I'll have to dig that one up.

29
00:01:56.84 --> 00:02:02.12
The most recent official edition had been the Field Service Regulations dated 1923.

30
00:02:02.12 --> 00:02:07.32
The Army of 1941 desperately needed an up-to-date, doctrinal guidance.

31
00:02:07.32 --> 00:02:09.76
The world was already engulfed in war.

32
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:12.36
And the United States had begun to mobilize.

33
00:02:12.36 --> 00:02:18.52
Thus the Army was eight times larger than it had been in 1939.

34
00:02:18.52 --> 00:02:19.52
That's two years.

35
00:02:19.52 --> 00:02:20.76
1939 to 1941.

36
00:02:20.76 --> 00:02:24.16
You want to talk, you know, you and I work with companies now.

37
00:02:24.16 --> 00:02:25.48
And we're growing a lot.

38
00:02:25.48 --> 00:02:27.16
We're in a growth phase.

39
00:02:27.16 --> 00:02:30.52
Eight times bigger in two years.

40
00:02:30.52 --> 00:02:31.88
And we're not talking about a small organ.

41
00:02:31.88 --> 00:02:35.76
It's one thing to go from, you know, two people to 16.

42
00:02:35.76 --> 00:02:37.40
Hey, we're eight times bigger.

43
00:02:37.40 --> 00:02:45.92
But to go from whatever, a few hundred thousand to over a million, that's serious growth.

44
00:02:45.92 --> 00:02:50.40
So continuing more over it, it also embarked on a modernization program that affected

45
00:02:50.40 --> 00:02:53.52
virtually every facet of military activity.

46
00:02:53.52 --> 00:03:01.16
The edition, the 1941 edition of FM-100, Tac-5 encapsulates the state of Army doctrine on the

47
00:03:01.16 --> 00:03:03.84
eve of America's entry into World War II.

48
00:03:03.84 --> 00:03:10.12
The 1941 version of FM-100, Tac-5, has long been recognized as a classic piece of doctrine

49
00:03:10.12 --> 00:03:11.36
writing.

50
00:03:11.36 --> 00:03:15.24
Remarkable for its clarity of concept and prose.

51
00:03:15.24 --> 00:03:19.36
Now come on folks, we can't give you that much credit.

52
00:03:19.36 --> 00:03:21.92
We just read the German version.

53
00:03:21.92 --> 00:03:24.12
And we know that we know we're getting this from.

54
00:03:24.12 --> 00:03:29.40
So that's a little bit of a bold statement there coming from this preface.

55
00:03:29.40 --> 00:03:33.32
It also has valuable historical, it is also a valuable historical artifact preserving

56
00:03:33.32 --> 00:03:38.48
as it does the doctrinal thought of the Army at a critical juncture in history.

57
00:03:38.48 --> 00:03:46.000
And this is signed by Christopher R. Gable PhD historian, combat studies institute, U.S. Army

58
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
command and general staff calls.

59
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Did you go to work college?

60
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.96
No, I went to Johns Hopkins instead.

61
00:03:52.96 --> 00:03:55.32
Oh wait, what do they call you?

62
00:03:55.32 --> 00:03:57.60
Oh that's right, you deal day.

63
00:03:57.60 --> 00:03:58.60
Check.

64
00:03:58.60 --> 00:04:02.36
And what did you study there?

65
00:04:02.36 --> 00:04:05.000
International public policy.

66
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
How long was it?

67
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
How long was the school?

68
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
About 18 months.

69
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.92
The academic fellowship, so it was basically civilian.

70
00:04:10.92 --> 00:04:14.12
Got a master's degree and started working on a second degree while I was there.

71
00:04:14.12 --> 00:04:16.32
What was the second degree that you started working on?

72
00:04:16.32 --> 00:04:17.32
MBA.

73
00:04:17.32 --> 00:04:19.84
Okay.

74
00:04:19.84 --> 00:04:22.08
The policy, what were you doing?

75
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:26.80
Yeah, so really what that was about is the reason why the Marine Corps sent me to do that

76
00:04:26.80 --> 00:04:32.20
is to, after that was going to go to the Joint Staff to help formulate how we relate

77
00:04:32.20 --> 00:04:36.24
to other countries and the security that goes along with that and the relationships we have

78
00:04:36.24 --> 00:04:38.40
with other countries was actually pretty important.

79
00:04:38.40 --> 00:04:42.92
A lot of those lessons came from World War II and this isolationist mindset didn't help

80
00:04:42.92 --> 00:04:49.000
us in the beginning and how to form policy that helps the country create security around

81
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the world really.

82
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.44
Who are the professors?

83
00:04:51.44 --> 00:04:55.36
Probably the most prominent professor there was Elliott Cohen.

84
00:04:55.36 --> 00:05:01.32
He's now the dean at SICE, but he ran the strategic studies department that I was there

85
00:05:01.32 --> 00:05:05.52
and then John McLaughlin, who was the former acting director of the CIA.

86
00:05:05.52 --> 00:05:09.76
So some pretty amazing guys there, some pretty great access to some really smart folks.

87
00:05:09.76 --> 00:05:13.24
It spent their careers in international arena.

88
00:05:13.24 --> 00:05:14.24
Yeah, that's kind of a...

89
00:05:14.24 --> 00:05:15.24
Pretty legit.

90
00:05:15.24 --> 00:05:20.12
So no, I didn't go to work, I'll just...

91
00:05:20.12 --> 00:05:22.08
Good deal Dave coming in hot.

92
00:05:22.08 --> 00:05:23.08
All right.

93
00:05:23.08 --> 00:05:30.92
Now I will say that the Troopin Fierong has a much better kickoff, much better kickoff than

94
00:05:30.92 --> 00:05:35.84
the... than this one than the field surface regulations, but we're going to jump in.

95
00:05:35.84 --> 00:05:38.84
Here's where I'm going to pick it up.

96
00:05:38.84 --> 00:05:43.68
The... the... in fact, this one is so unappic, I'm not reading it.

97
00:05:43.68 --> 00:05:46.20
Ah, well, now I kind of have to.

98
00:05:46.20 --> 00:05:50.24
It starts off with with just kind of a blah, blah.

99
00:05:50.24 --> 00:05:51.88
Field surface regulations.

100
00:05:51.88 --> 00:05:55.92
It's just... yeah.

101
00:05:55.92 --> 00:05:56.92
Here's what it says.

102
00:05:56.92 --> 00:06:01.56
Field FM 100-tack five field surface regulations, operations, is published for the information

103
00:06:01.56 --> 00:06:03.000
and guidance of all concern.

104
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.24
It contains the doctrines of leading troops in combat and tactics of the combined arms and

105
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:11.08
constitutes the basis of instruction of all arms and services for field surface.

106
00:06:11.08 --> 00:06:12.24
Okay, that's not bad.

107
00:06:12.24 --> 00:06:13.84
This is actually decent.

108
00:06:13.84 --> 00:06:18.32
While the fundamental doctrines of combat operations are neither numerous nor complex,

109
00:06:18.32 --> 00:06:20.80
their application is sometimes difficult.

110
00:06:20.80 --> 00:06:24.56
I think we call that simple, not easy.

111
00:06:24.56 --> 00:06:26.44
That is simple, not easy.

112
00:06:26.44 --> 00:06:32.68
100% knowledge of these doctrines and experience in the application provide all commanders

113
00:06:32.68 --> 00:06:36.52
of firm basis of action in a particular situation.

114
00:06:36.52 --> 00:06:37.96
So let's think about this.

115
00:06:37.96 --> 00:06:40.16
This reminds me of what Mattis says.

116
00:06:40.16 --> 00:06:43.80
Mattis is like, I'm not going to get surprised on the battlefield because I've read

117
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:44.80
something close to it.

118
00:06:44.80 --> 00:06:46.44
I've read something close to it.

119
00:06:46.44 --> 00:06:47.44
Something I can relate to.

120
00:06:47.44 --> 00:06:51.64
So knowledge of these doctrines and experience in their application provide all commanders

121
00:06:51.64 --> 00:06:55.64
a firm basis for action in a particular situation.

122
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:01.12
This knowledge and experience enable the commander to utilize the flexible organization

123
00:07:01.12 --> 00:07:06.28
with which he is provided to group his forces in detasque units most suitable for the

124
00:07:06.28 --> 00:07:10.20
accomplishment of his mission.

125
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:13.08
Now we get what that's saying.

126
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:14.08
And it's pretty cold to say.

127
00:07:14.08 --> 00:07:16.40
It's also very verbose.

128
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:19.44
Hey, you got to task organize sometimes.

129
00:07:19.44 --> 00:07:21.04
You got to have a flexible organization.

130
00:07:21.04 --> 00:07:23.80
Yes, definitely.

131
00:07:23.80 --> 00:07:29.68
It goes on and this is where we get we start getting a little bit of fire going here.

132
00:07:29.68 --> 00:07:34.96
Set rules and methods must be avoided.

133
00:07:34.96 --> 00:07:39.20
That is probably the last thing that someone would think about the military.

134
00:07:39.20 --> 00:07:40.20
Right?

135
00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:43.96
Set rules and methods must be avoided.

136
00:07:43.96 --> 00:07:46.92
And I'll say I actually think that's a little bit of a strong statement.

137
00:07:46.92 --> 00:07:50.000
Like you actually have to have standard operating procedures.

138
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.60
You have to have some rules in place.

139
00:07:52.60 --> 00:07:59.44
I think maybe that's the kind of statement where you're making it because the common practice

140
00:07:59.44 --> 00:08:02.32
is to follow set rules so strictly.

141
00:08:02.32 --> 00:08:03.84
And I'll give you another example.

142
00:08:03.84 --> 00:08:06.72
So you know what we talk about humility all the time?

143
00:08:06.72 --> 00:08:09.000
We talk about humility all the time.

144
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.56
Even though confidence is an equally important trait for a leader to have.

145
00:08:14.56 --> 00:08:17.64
Why aren't we running around telling people to be confident all the time?

146
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:23.52
Because 98% of the time the issue is not people are lack confidence.

147
00:08:23.52 --> 00:08:25.80
98% of the time it's that they lack humility.

148
00:08:25.80 --> 00:08:28.80
So that's why we end up talking about that all the time.

149
00:08:28.80 --> 00:08:30.40
Hey, you got to be humbly, you got to be humble.

150
00:08:30.40 --> 00:08:32.60
Because who ends up in leadership positions?

151
00:08:32.60 --> 00:08:33.60
Right?

152
00:08:33.60 --> 00:08:35.52
Does somebody that's afraid to step up and isn't confident?

153
00:08:35.52 --> 00:08:37.24
They don't end up in leadership positions.

154
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:43.16
So over years, if we're dealing with the CEO of a company or we're dealing with a unit

155
00:08:43.16 --> 00:08:51.60
commander in the military or a team leader in any organization, they got there for years

156
00:08:51.60 --> 00:08:53.68
of being confident for sure.

157
00:08:53.68 --> 00:08:54.68
That's how they ended up there.

158
00:08:54.68 --> 00:09:02.000
So and it worked for them and not only exacerbates and magnifies their confidence, which

159
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.52
is good.

160
00:09:03.52 --> 00:09:07.08
But when they get to a point where all of a sudden they start believing their own hype

161
00:09:07.08 --> 00:09:08.20
and that's where it becomes a problem.

162
00:09:08.20 --> 00:09:15.84
So 98% of the time the problem that we're dealing with isn't a lack of confidence is

163
00:09:15.84 --> 00:09:16.84
a lack of humility.

164
00:09:16.84 --> 00:09:20.64
Now where this changes is when we're dealing with a young junior officer that feels

165
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:23.000
like they're insecure, they don't really know what they should do.

166
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.84
And they need to have confidence.

167
00:09:26.84 --> 00:09:30.80
And the confidence that they actually need is the confidence to say, hey, you know what,

168
00:09:30.80 --> 00:09:35.32
sergeant or hey, you know what, forming on a job site, I don't really know how to do

169
00:09:35.32 --> 00:09:36.32
this.

170
00:09:36.32 --> 00:09:37.96
Can you guide me through it?

171
00:09:37.96 --> 00:09:38.96
That's the only confidence they need.

172
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:40.96
They don't know how to do the actual thing.

173
00:09:40.96 --> 00:09:41.96
Yeah.

174
00:09:41.96 --> 00:09:47.24
They just need to, they just need to have the confidence that they can say, I don't get it.

175
00:09:47.24 --> 00:09:50.76
And it won't undermine their credibility as a leader to admit that they don't know what

176
00:09:50.76 --> 00:09:51.76
to do.

177
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:53.84
No, it doesn't undermine it at all.

178
00:09:53.84 --> 00:09:57.64
So what they're saying here is you got these military folks that are always following

179
00:09:57.64 --> 00:09:58.64
the rules.

180
00:09:58.64 --> 00:10:00.04
That's kind of the, that's the lean.

181
00:10:00.04 --> 00:10:01.40
That's the tendency.

182
00:10:01.40 --> 00:10:05.28
The tendency is military guy, you got to told to do something, you're going to do

183
00:10:05.28 --> 00:10:06.28
it.

184
00:10:06.28 --> 00:10:10.92
What they're saying is leaning, getting pulling back the other direction a little bit harder

185
00:10:10.92 --> 00:10:15.96
to balance the dichotomy a little bit as set rules and methods must be avoided.

186
00:10:15.96 --> 00:10:16.96
And then it continues.

187
00:10:16.96 --> 00:10:22.52
They limit imagination and initiative, which are so important in the successful prosecution

188
00:10:22.52 --> 00:10:26.48
of war.

189
00:10:26.48 --> 00:10:32.36
They provide the enemy a fixed pattern of operations, which he can more easily counter.

190
00:10:32.36 --> 00:10:33.52
Yeah, which he can exploit.

191
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:34.52
Right.

192
00:10:34.52 --> 00:10:36.20
So you're doing the same thing over and over again.

193
00:10:36.20 --> 00:10:37.20
Cool.

194
00:10:37.20 --> 00:10:38.20
Watch this.

195
00:10:38.20 --> 00:10:39.20
We'll be waiting for you.

196
00:10:39.20 --> 00:10:43.08
And now we get to the point where I was kind of like, well, what this book starts

197
00:10:43.08 --> 00:10:47.08
off with is basically, you know, you know, you get a legal document and it starts off with

198
00:10:47.08 --> 00:10:48.84
the definition of all the terms.

199
00:10:48.84 --> 00:10:50.08
That's what this starts off with.

200
00:10:50.08 --> 00:10:51.44
Theodore War comprises this.

201
00:10:51.44 --> 00:10:52.68
Theodore operations is that.

202
00:10:52.68 --> 00:10:54.24
Combat zone is this.

203
00:10:54.24 --> 00:10:55.48
Communication zone is that.

204
00:10:55.48 --> 00:11:00.72
And so it goes through a bunch of sort of tactical terms, which is fine.

205
00:11:00.72 --> 00:11:03.16
I mean, they're necessary.

206
00:11:03.16 --> 00:11:05.16
But that's kind of where this thing starts off.

207
00:11:05.16 --> 00:11:10.60
Whereas the troop in fearing starts off with just the most legit intro.

208
00:11:10.60 --> 00:11:16.96
Here's, here's number one from the troop in for the conduct of war is an art, depending

209
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:22.36
upon free, creative activity scientifically grounded.

210
00:11:22.36 --> 00:11:26.04
It makes the highest demands on the personality.

211
00:11:26.04 --> 00:11:28.08
That's how that one starts off.

212
00:11:28.08 --> 00:11:30.84
This one I'll read because these are both numbered the same way.

213
00:11:30.84 --> 00:11:32.68
That's how much they ripped it off.

214
00:11:32.68 --> 00:11:35.76
They're both kind of every single paragraph throughout is numbered.

215
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:39.60
This one starts off with theater of war comprises those areas of land, sea and air, which

216
00:11:39.60 --> 00:11:42.92
are or may become directly involved in the conduct of war.

217
00:11:42.92 --> 00:11:43.92
Week.

218
00:11:43.92 --> 00:11:44.92
Week.

219
00:11:44.92 --> 00:11:45.92
We didn't want that.

220
00:11:45.92 --> 00:11:47.08
That's not what we were looking for.

221
00:11:47.08 --> 00:11:53.76
So then finally, in chapter two, it starts to step up a little bit.

222
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:54.76
And you're going to start.

223
00:11:54.76 --> 00:11:57.08
This is where you're going to start hearing some of the same stuff.

224
00:11:57.08 --> 00:11:58.40
A little bit different.

225
00:11:58.40 --> 00:12:01.48
Translated a little bit differently.

226
00:12:01.48 --> 00:12:02.48
Here we go.

227
00:12:02.48 --> 00:12:07.56
One arm wins battles.

228
00:12:07.56 --> 00:12:11.36
The combined action of all arms and services is essential to success.

229
00:12:11.36 --> 00:12:16.16
The characteristics of each arm and service adapt it to the performance of its special

230
00:12:16.16 --> 00:12:21.80
function, the higher commander coordinates and directs the action of all, exploiting their

231
00:12:21.80 --> 00:12:25.36
powers to attain the ends sought.

232
00:12:25.36 --> 00:12:26.24
So we have to work together.

233
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:29.04
We have to cover move for each other.

234
00:12:29.04 --> 00:12:33.28
It's important to remember, you're not going to win alone.

235
00:12:33.28 --> 00:12:35.68
That's also why they say there's no set answer for this.

236
00:12:35.68 --> 00:12:38.32
You don't know what arm or which component you have is going to be the one that you're

237
00:12:38.32 --> 00:12:39.32
going to use.

238
00:12:39.32 --> 00:12:42.68
And if I set it at SOP says in this situation, you do this every single time.

239
00:12:42.68 --> 00:12:44.000
You're going to lose every single time.

240
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.56
Because there is no prescribed way to do it.

241
00:12:45.56 --> 00:12:48.12
There's just a framework and understanding how they work.

242
00:12:48.12 --> 00:12:50.56
And the art is what do I do now?

243
00:12:50.56 --> 00:12:51.92
This is also an interesting.

244
00:12:51.92 --> 00:12:55.28
If you break this down to a really granular level.

245
00:12:55.28 --> 00:13:00.96
And this is a question that has come up before, to me, you've got a person that's naturally

246
00:13:00.96 --> 00:13:04.20
good at something, but they're really not naturally good at something else.

247
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:05.20
What do you do?

248
00:13:05.20 --> 00:13:08.52
According to this, what you do is you exploit their powers.

249
00:13:08.52 --> 00:13:10.40
You take advantage of what they're good at.

250
00:13:10.40 --> 00:13:15.92
Of course, it doesn't mean, if I've got Dave Burke who's really good at interacting

251
00:13:15.92 --> 00:13:22.08
relationships with a client, but you're horrible at paperwork, I don't assign you to

252
00:13:22.08 --> 00:13:24.52
be in charge of the paperwork and not let you start to client.

253
00:13:24.52 --> 00:13:26.76
It wouldn't make you better.

254
00:13:26.76 --> 00:13:29.56
No, I want to take advantage of what you're good at.

255
00:13:29.56 --> 00:13:33.76
I will still say, hey, Dave, man, you've got to get better paperwork.

256
00:13:33.76 --> 00:13:34.76
You've got to get better paperwork.

257
00:13:34.76 --> 00:13:38.76
I'm not going to have you running it, but you've got to get better at it.

258
00:13:38.76 --> 00:13:39.76
And you're like, cool.

259
00:13:39.76 --> 00:13:41.80
And over time, you do get better at it.

260
00:13:41.80 --> 00:13:42.80
But it's not.

261
00:13:42.80 --> 00:13:48.12
And then I got someone else that's awesome at paperwork, but they're not good at communications.

262
00:13:48.12 --> 00:13:50.88
Well, I'm not going to put them in the client facing position.

263
00:13:50.88 --> 00:13:54.56
I'm going to put them in the back room with a computer bot.

264
00:13:54.56 --> 00:13:55.80
We are going to work with them.

265
00:13:55.80 --> 00:14:01.80
We're going to make them get up and talk to some clients so that we do build a more well-rounded

266
00:14:01.80 --> 00:14:02.80
team.

267
00:14:02.80 --> 00:14:03.80
Yeah, for sure.

268
00:14:03.80 --> 00:14:07.68
You actually don't know when that person who is weak at this one thing might need

269
00:14:07.68 --> 00:14:10.20
to rely on that for organizational success.

270
00:14:10.20 --> 00:14:11.84
You can't ignore that.

271
00:14:11.84 --> 00:14:16.72
Yeah, in a sealed position, I mean, every, okay, you've got your corpsmen, your medic.

272
00:14:16.72 --> 00:14:21.20
The corpsmen obviously is the go-to guy who's carrying the med gear and is trained at an

273
00:14:21.20 --> 00:14:22.92
incredibly advanced level.

274
00:14:22.92 --> 00:14:25.96
But every single person knows how to put out a turn-to-kit, knows how to stop the bleeding.

275
00:14:25.96 --> 00:14:29.36
I've used how to do an IV, and knows how to do a needle-down decompression.

276
00:14:29.36 --> 00:14:30.52
We all get that training.

277
00:14:30.52 --> 00:14:31.52
We can make it happen.

278
00:14:31.52 --> 00:14:32.52
Yep.

279
00:14:32.52 --> 00:14:33.52
Same thing with cons.

280
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:34.52
Same thing with everyone.

281
00:14:34.52 --> 00:14:37.84
Everybody knows how to shoot that, that pig gun.

282
00:14:37.84 --> 00:14:41.24
Everybody in the squad, everyone in the platoon knows how to do that.

283
00:14:41.24 --> 00:14:43.24
Everybody's going to need a note of program the radio.

284
00:14:43.24 --> 00:14:44.24
Yes indeed.

285
00:14:44.24 --> 00:14:45.24
True statement.

286
00:14:45.24 --> 00:14:54.08
All right, now what it does now is it breaks down every sort of arm that we're talking

287
00:14:54.08 --> 00:14:55.08
about.

288
00:14:55.08 --> 00:14:56.40
We're talking to arms, the different no-one arm wins battles.

289
00:14:56.40 --> 00:15:00.92
It breaks down every arm, it breaks down cavalry, field artillery, co-star-tiltary, air

290
00:15:00.92 --> 00:15:04.12
corps, engineer, signal corps, chemical warfare.

291
00:15:04.12 --> 00:15:08.88
Because remember, this is coming off of World War I.

292
00:15:08.88 --> 00:15:11.36
I'm not going to cover all those, but I will look at infantry.

293
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:14.68
Because it just says a couple things about infantry.

294
00:15:14.68 --> 00:15:19.76
The infantry is essentially an arm of close combat.

295
00:15:19.76 --> 00:15:23.68
Its primary mission in the attack is to close with the enemy and destroy your capture room,

296
00:15:23.68 --> 00:15:27.76
in defense to hold its position and repel the hostile attack.

297
00:15:27.76 --> 00:15:31.20
Infantry fights by combining fire movement.

298
00:15:31.20 --> 00:15:36.16
I think we call that cover move, and shock action.

299
00:15:36.16 --> 00:15:41.04
Sometimes people use words that I need to completely embed into my vocabulary.

300
00:15:41.04 --> 00:15:44.48
Shock action is one of those things.

301
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:49.64
By fire, it inflicts losses on the enemy and neutralizes his combat power.

302
00:15:49.64 --> 00:15:55.16
By movement, it closes with the enemy and makes its fire more effective.

303
00:15:55.16 --> 00:16:02.72
By shock action, it completes the destruction of the enemy in close combat.

304
00:16:02.72 --> 00:16:04.72
Amen.

305
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:07.72
Totally.

306
00:16:07.72 --> 00:16:13.96
But then we got a little butt here, because we all love infantry, but here we go.

307
00:16:13.96 --> 00:16:20.48
Infantry is capable of limited, independent action through the employment of its own weapons.

308
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:25.80
Its offensive power decreases appreciably when its freedom to maneuver is limited or

309
00:16:25.80 --> 00:16:29.32
when it is confronted by an organized, defensive position.

310
00:16:29.32 --> 00:16:36.32
That's why as much as I love infantry, you have to have the supporting arms.

311
00:16:36.32 --> 00:16:43.32
When you capture the enemy in the combined arms dilemma, that is the glory of warfare.

312
00:16:43.32 --> 00:16:46.80
You know what was crazy?

313
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:50.56
I don't remember when I first heard the term the combined arms dilemma.

314
00:16:50.56 --> 00:16:54.64
And for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, it's when the enemy or when

315
00:16:54.64 --> 00:17:01.56
you are attacking the enemy from multiple different weapon systems, and no matter what they do,

316
00:17:01.56 --> 00:17:03.28
they're trapped, they're on a dilemma.

317
00:17:03.28 --> 00:17:07.20
If they move one direction, they're going to hit with one type of weapon.

318
00:17:07.20 --> 00:17:09.08
If they move in another direction, they're going to hit with another.

319
00:17:09.08 --> 00:17:11.56
If they go to ground and hide, then the infantry is going to move in.

320
00:17:11.56 --> 00:17:13.76
You've got them in the combined arms dilemma.

321
00:17:13.76 --> 00:17:14.76
This is what it is.

322
00:17:14.76 --> 00:17:15.76
You know what it essentially?

323
00:17:15.76 --> 00:17:16.76
It's a checkmate.

324
00:17:16.76 --> 00:17:17.76
That's a checkmate.

325
00:17:17.76 --> 00:17:18.76
That's exactly right.

326
00:17:18.76 --> 00:17:19.76
That's exactly right.

327
00:17:19.76 --> 00:17:27.32
What's interesting is, and what was scary was in Ramadi, the enemy would trap coalition forces

328
00:17:27.32 --> 00:17:29.20
in the combined arms dilemma.

329
00:17:29.20 --> 00:17:38.52
And so they would initiate perhaps by dropping mortars onto a little outstation.

330
00:17:38.52 --> 00:17:43.16
When you're getting mortared, what you have to do is you have to get overhead cover.

331
00:17:43.16 --> 00:17:46.60
So now when you get overhead cover, you're basically hiding.

332
00:17:46.60 --> 00:17:49.96
When you're hiding, then they come out with machine gun fire.

333
00:17:49.96 --> 00:17:53.32
They start shooting machine guns because they can expose themselves, they can start shooting

334
00:17:53.32 --> 00:17:54.32
machine guns.

335
00:17:54.32 --> 00:17:58.80
While the machine guns, you can you can shoulder and shoot a machine gun very rapidly.

336
00:17:58.80 --> 00:18:04.40
So while that's happening, now you're essentially pinned down.

337
00:18:04.40 --> 00:18:08.04
Now they come out with the rockets because they take a little bit longer to aim.

338
00:18:08.04 --> 00:18:12.28
They're more, you know, an RPG takes a little bit more time to aim and you're more exposed.

339
00:18:12.28 --> 00:18:13.64
There's back blasts deal with.

340
00:18:13.64 --> 00:18:15.84
So it's a little bit harder to weapon to handle.

341
00:18:15.84 --> 00:18:17.04
So it takes a little bit more time.

342
00:18:17.04 --> 00:18:22.48
But when you're getting cover fire from a machine gun, you got that time.

343
00:18:22.48 --> 00:18:23.80
So then they can come the rockets.

344
00:18:23.80 --> 00:18:29.72
Now while this is happening, here comes the vehicle born idea and now everyone's heads

345
00:18:29.72 --> 00:18:30.72
are down.

346
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:37.20
Explosions are going off and while this is happening, a vehicle born ID now closes in, makes

347
00:18:37.20 --> 00:18:44.32
it through the serpentine and blows up inside of one of these little outposts that happened.

348
00:18:44.32 --> 00:18:49.56
Multiple times while we're in the body and these little outposts, these little checkpoints,

349
00:18:49.56 --> 00:18:54.20
these little ECPs would be in several cases overrun.

350
00:18:54.20 --> 00:18:55.40
Yeah.

351
00:18:55.40 --> 00:19:00.80
The enemy also evolved while we were there too and we started to see them account for

352
00:19:00.80 --> 00:19:03.000
what they knew our normal reaction would be.

353
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.84
We understand what a combined arms element is and the other thing that they did that made

354
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:12.20
that situation so hard was they would interact with the civilians.

355
00:19:12.20 --> 00:19:13.64
So they knew our normal response.

356
00:19:13.64 --> 00:19:17.24
If you wanted to get on your heavy machine guns and lay down a base of fire, there was so

357
00:19:17.24 --> 00:19:21.04
much risk at injuring civilians that we had to account for and they knew that.

358
00:19:21.04 --> 00:19:26.24
So they made our normal response to that so much more difficult and they added that additional

359
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:30.32
layer of complexity for us so we had limited options and they took full advantage of that.

360
00:19:30.32 --> 00:19:36.72
And those those V-Bids, those fuel laden, you know, trash trucks and things like that.

361
00:19:36.72 --> 00:19:39.76
Those things that they did and watch them get better accounting for what they knew we

362
00:19:39.76 --> 00:19:44.96
would do made it even harder for us and they look, they got good at that and it was really

363
00:19:44.96 --> 00:19:45.96
really tough.

364
00:19:45.96 --> 00:19:53.60
And taking it well again, adaptation, if you recall, when, well, when I first got there,

365
00:19:53.60 --> 00:19:56.04
they would do one of those attacks at a time.

366
00:19:56.04 --> 00:19:57.04
Yeah.

367
00:19:57.04 --> 00:20:03.08
There was a couple days where they did two or three of those attacks simultaneously in

368
00:20:03.08 --> 00:20:06.20
different parts of the city because then they knew, hey, they're going to overwhelm our

369
00:20:06.20 --> 00:20:07.20
casualty evacuation.

370
00:20:07.20 --> 00:20:09.04
They're going to overwhelm our fire support.

371
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:11.04
They're going to overwhelm our QRF.

372
00:20:11.04 --> 00:20:12.04
So they were good.

373
00:20:12.04 --> 00:20:13.68
Yeah, they were good.

374
00:20:13.68 --> 00:20:18.48
The combined arms dilemma, it's a positive thing when you put somebody in it.

375
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:19.92
It's a negative thing when it happens to you.

376
00:20:19.92 --> 00:20:24.88
By the way, just, I mean, it's worth noting that when you're doing GJ2, you're looking for

377
00:20:24.88 --> 00:20:25.88
the same thing.

378
00:20:25.88 --> 00:20:33.12
You're looking to set up a triangle, arm lock, sweep combined arms dilemma.

379
00:20:33.12 --> 00:20:34.28
You've got three things.

380
00:20:34.28 --> 00:20:36.92
If they defend one, you're going to catch them in the other.

381
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:38.16
You've got them in checkmate.

382
00:20:38.16 --> 00:20:40.16
That's what you're trying to do.

383
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:50.28
All right, now after that, like I said, this whole next section, it just explains each

384
00:20:50.28 --> 00:20:59.84
one of the various arms that we have, you know, from like I said, from cavalry to field artillery

385
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:04.24
and boy, it was a happy and remodied when we were able to use field artillery.

386
00:21:04.24 --> 00:21:06.24
That was, that was awesome.

387
00:21:06.24 --> 00:21:12.04
I mean, it was awesome to, to tanks and field artillery.

388
00:21:12.04 --> 00:21:16.04
There's not too many people in modern warfare that get to do that.

389
00:21:16.04 --> 00:21:18.04
Yeah, I got to control some artillery.

390
00:21:18.04 --> 00:21:21.32
I think it was like the two to F.A. and they didn't, we didn't get to use them a lot, but

391
00:21:21.32 --> 00:21:23.84
man, they were so dialed in when we called for them.

392
00:21:23.84 --> 00:21:27.88
They were ready to go, getting to use them was awesome.

393
00:21:27.88 --> 00:21:31.16
Because it wasn't that common, but when we did, man, they were so dialed in.

394
00:21:31.16 --> 00:21:35.24
Yeah, I remember the most, I remember they fired a ton of a loom.

395
00:21:35.24 --> 00:21:37.12
We were doing a big night operation.

396
00:21:37.12 --> 00:21:41.16
I think it was when we were pushing into like a cop iron.

397
00:21:41.16 --> 00:21:42.80
Springfield maybe something like that.

398
00:21:42.80 --> 00:21:46.80
And they just, they just put up a little for a solid 45 minutes.

399
00:21:46.80 --> 00:21:49.24
It was so epic.

400
00:21:49.24 --> 00:21:53.68
And it was because the Iraqi soldiers couldn't, didn't have night vision.

401
00:21:53.68 --> 00:21:55.84
So hey, let's get them, let's get them to be able to see.

402
00:21:55.84 --> 00:21:59.28
So it covers that, it covers the, what do they call it?

403
00:21:59.28 --> 00:22:02.40
Coastal, Coast artillery core.

404
00:22:02.40 --> 00:22:10.28
They cover the air core, which is pretty short and we'll get into that later.

405
00:22:10.28 --> 00:22:16.80
Pretty World War II air was not a huge element in warfare.

406
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:23.64
In World War II, it was in many, in many cases, the biggest part of warfare.

407
00:22:23.64 --> 00:22:26.36
So some battles were almost pure warfare.

408
00:22:26.36 --> 00:22:27.36
We're air warfare.

409
00:22:27.36 --> 00:22:32.08
I mean, a lot of those naval battles were, I don't know, what percentage, but a

410
00:22:32.08 --> 00:22:34.96
massive percentage was air warfare.

411
00:22:34.96 --> 00:22:40.68
The battle of Britain, the battle of Britain was 100% air warfare.

412
00:22:40.68 --> 00:22:46.04
So, and we'll talk about some of the changes that happened in 1944 when they rewrote

413
00:22:46.04 --> 00:22:47.04
this thing.

414
00:22:47.04 --> 00:22:48.04
So then they talk about the signal core.

415
00:22:48.04 --> 00:22:49.24
They talk about chemical warfare.

416
00:22:49.24 --> 00:22:57.04
So they cover all those things and again, kind of lay out what they are and what's important

417
00:22:57.04 --> 00:22:59.32
about them.

418
00:22:59.32 --> 00:23:07.88
And then they finally get into chapter three, which is called leadership.

419
00:23:07.88 --> 00:23:13.72
And now they get, they get some credit right now because they're coming out strong, strong.

420
00:23:13.72 --> 00:23:20.72
Maybe even stronger than our German friends over here in the Tupenturon, opening line,

421
00:23:20.72 --> 00:23:23.48
chapter three, leadership.

422
00:23:23.48 --> 00:23:28.36
Leadership is based on knowledge of men.

423
00:23:28.36 --> 00:23:32.20
So you're understanding human nature is what you have to do if you're going to be in leadership

424
00:23:32.20 --> 00:23:33.20
position.

425
00:23:33.20 --> 00:23:34.72
That's what we're talking about.

426
00:23:34.72 --> 00:23:37.40
That's what we've been talking about.

427
00:23:37.40 --> 00:23:40.44
That's what we talk about all the time.

428
00:23:40.44 --> 00:23:41.84
And that's not just leadership in war.

429
00:23:41.84 --> 00:23:43.84
That's leadership everywhere.

430
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:47.60
That's what business, everything, that's exactly how it's, it's people.

431
00:23:47.60 --> 00:23:48.60
It's men.

432
00:23:48.60 --> 00:23:57.000
And that is, that's why when I went to college, we were talking about your college, where

433
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.56
you studied policy, right?

434
00:24:01.56 --> 00:24:03.44
I studied men.

435
00:24:03.44 --> 00:24:07.56
And I did, and I did it because I was reading books.

436
00:24:07.56 --> 00:24:14.48
And I'll tell you, I've said this before, the guy that understands human nature, I think

437
00:24:14.48 --> 00:24:18.28
maybe better than anyone else, Shakespeare.

438
00:24:18.28 --> 00:24:20.12
It's crazy as that sounds.

439
00:24:20.12 --> 00:24:22.12
You start diving into those books.

440
00:24:22.12 --> 00:24:24.96
He understood people.

441
00:24:24.96 --> 00:24:26.92
There's a lot of lessons to be learned.

442
00:24:26.92 --> 00:24:33.60
At some point in my life, I'm going to do every Shakespeare play.

443
00:24:33.60 --> 00:24:39.16
I'm going to cover it all because there's so many lessons in each one of those.

444
00:24:39.16 --> 00:24:40.16
We'll get there.

445
00:24:40.16 --> 00:24:42.72
All right, continues on.

446
00:24:42.72 --> 00:24:44.72
And it's where we go.

447
00:24:44.72 --> 00:24:48.000
We're still, we're still staying strong right now.

448
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.60
Man is the fundamental instrument in war.

449
00:24:51.60 --> 00:24:56.56
Other instruments may change, but he remains relatively constant.

450
00:24:56.56 --> 00:25:01.94
Unless his behavior and elemental attributes are understood, gross mistakes will be made in

451
00:25:01.94 --> 00:25:05.44
planning operations and in troop leading.

452
00:25:05.44 --> 00:25:11.16
In training the individual soldier, the essential considerations are to integrate individuals

453
00:25:11.16 --> 00:25:17.04
into a group and establish for that group a high standard of military conduct and performance

454
00:25:17.04 --> 00:25:24.04
of duty without destroying the initiative of the individual.

455
00:25:24.04 --> 00:25:27.04
Yes.

456
00:25:27.04 --> 00:25:29.04
Is there much more to say?

457
00:25:29.04 --> 00:25:32.48
That should just be read over and over again.

458
00:25:32.48 --> 00:25:38.32
And how hard the balance is for a leader to cultivate that and to allow that to happen

459
00:25:38.32 --> 00:25:40.04
and how critical that is.

460
00:25:40.04 --> 00:25:43.60
Because without either of those, you simply cannot be successful.

461
00:25:43.60 --> 00:25:50.20
I can't remember if it was life or JP at the muster was telling a story about how they

462
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:52.84
were watching, it was life.

463
00:25:52.84 --> 00:25:56.60
He was out watching when he was the ops officer at a seal team.

464
00:25:56.60 --> 00:25:58.16
He was out watching the training.

465
00:25:58.16 --> 00:26:00.52
I was putting the guys through training.

466
00:26:00.52 --> 00:26:01.96
And all K. also is breaking loose.

467
00:26:01.96 --> 00:26:02.96
It was total mayhem.

468
00:26:02.96 --> 00:26:05.08
It was an urban environment.

469
00:26:05.08 --> 00:26:08.36
And there was no leadership happening.

470
00:26:08.36 --> 00:26:12.04
Leaders were all just overwhelmed.

471
00:26:12.04 --> 00:26:19.16
And he sees me walk over to this young kind of pipeting E5 who I've been watching him.

472
00:26:19.16 --> 00:26:20.48
I've been tracking him.

473
00:26:20.48 --> 00:26:22.92
And I can see that he's good.

474
00:26:22.92 --> 00:26:27.24
He's a good aggressive.

475
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:28.96
He's a natural leader.

476
00:26:28.96 --> 00:26:31.96
And I walk over to him and he's holding like a saw.

477
00:26:31.96 --> 00:26:35.84
And I was like, bro, you know what I'm like, bro, what's going on?

478
00:26:35.84 --> 00:26:39.64
He's like, we need to get out of here and I was like, make it happen.

479
00:26:39.64 --> 00:26:44.08
And you can see his eyes, he's kind of questioning because you know, he's, I think he's

480
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:45.08
a one cruise wonder.

481
00:26:45.08 --> 00:26:48.000
I'm like, you make it happen.

482
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.68
And he's like, okay, and just starts making the call.

483
00:26:53.68 --> 00:27:01.56
And that right there, at some point, he's initiative as an individual had been beat down.

484
00:27:01.56 --> 00:27:08.000
And as soon as it was released into the wild, he took charge and made things happen.

485
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.52
And so it is a hard balance.

486
00:27:09.52 --> 00:27:13.56
You can't have this dude just out there being rogue and trust me, some of these young

487
00:27:13.56 --> 00:27:14.56
seals.

488
00:27:14.56 --> 00:27:20.000
You give him a little indication that they can get after it and they're going to go to

489
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
the end three.

490
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And I would see that happen too.

491
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.40
You can get some some kid that's so over the top that they'll just start making, you

492
00:27:28.40 --> 00:27:31.16
know, trying to make everything happen themselves and they'll get out of control.

493
00:27:31.16 --> 00:27:33.04
And that'll be bad.

494
00:27:33.04 --> 00:27:36.68
So yes, this is what it is.

495
00:27:36.68 --> 00:27:41.68
Understanding behavior, understanding elemental attributes.

496
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:42.68
Yeah.

497
00:27:42.68 --> 00:27:43.68
All right.

498
00:27:43.68 --> 00:27:45.68
And then it goes on.

499
00:27:45.68 --> 00:27:51.48
War places a severe test on the physical endurance and moral stamina of the individual

500
00:27:51.48 --> 00:27:54.12
soldier to perform his duties efficiently.

501
00:27:54.12 --> 00:27:58.36
He must not only be well equipped and technically trained, but he must also be physically

502
00:27:58.36 --> 00:28:03.60
qualified to endure the hardships of field service and be constantly fortified by discipline

503
00:28:03.60 --> 00:28:08.52
based on the high ideals of military conduct.

504
00:28:08.52 --> 00:28:12.12
We salute you.

505
00:28:12.12 --> 00:28:13.12
You got to keep that.

506
00:28:13.12 --> 00:28:18.52
There was you got to keep that physical, the physical readiness.

507
00:28:18.52 --> 00:28:19.52
You have to have it.

508
00:28:19.52 --> 00:28:20.52
Yeah, for sure.

509
00:28:20.52 --> 00:28:25.88
But in the same sentence, they just say the phrase, you know, the moral standard too.

510
00:28:25.88 --> 00:28:30.96
Like it's, that's a really important thing.

511
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:33.24
And it's crazy how these sentences, they're so succinct.

512
00:28:33.24 --> 00:28:35.64
They're so straightforward, but just how powerful that comment is.

513
00:28:35.64 --> 00:28:37.12
The physical fitness and the moral standard.

514
00:28:37.12 --> 00:28:38.12
You have to keep both of those.

515
00:28:38.12 --> 00:28:39.32
You just those two things.

516
00:28:39.32 --> 00:28:40.68
Yeah.

517
00:28:40.68 --> 00:28:42.16
The moral stamina.

518
00:28:42.16 --> 00:28:43.40
Yeah.

519
00:28:43.40 --> 00:28:47.32
So easy for that to break down.

520
00:28:47.32 --> 00:28:53.000
Strong men, inculcated with a proper sense of duty, a conscious pride in their unit,

521
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.92
and a feeling of mutual obligation to their comrades in the group can dominate and demoralize,

522
00:28:58.92 --> 00:29:03.44
and dominate the demoralizing influences of battle far better than those in

523
00:29:03.44 --> 00:29:06.84
but only with the fear of punishment or disgrace.

524
00:29:10.44 --> 00:29:15.12
Yeah, there's a couple of things I was on Theo Vaughn's podcast yesterday.

525
00:29:15.12 --> 00:29:18.08
And we were talking about controlling your emotions.

526
00:29:18.08 --> 00:29:21.72
You know, he's an emotional guy and he was saying he doesn't, he was saying he's

527
00:29:21.72 --> 00:29:23.76
hilarious, but he was saying he doesn't have any emotion.

528
00:29:23.76 --> 00:29:26.04
He's not very good emotional memory.

529
00:29:26.04 --> 00:29:32.52
So when something bad happens, he does something and he gets a bad result and it's horrible.

530
00:29:32.52 --> 00:29:35.52
And then he'll make the same mistake a week later because he just doesn't remember.

531
00:29:35.52 --> 00:29:38.96
And then he goes, oh man, I'm so stupid.

532
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:46.88
And I was talking about the fact that I tried to figure out because I do consciously

533
00:29:46.88 --> 00:29:49.40
try and control my emotions.

534
00:29:49.40 --> 00:29:50.40
Right?

535
00:29:50.40 --> 00:29:52.72
And I was trying to think of where did that come from?

536
00:29:52.72 --> 00:29:54.96
Where do you start doing this?

537
00:29:54.96 --> 00:29:56.92
And the answer is actually pretty straightforward.

538
00:29:56.92 --> 00:30:01.96
I remember as I got more senior in the SEAL teams.

539
00:30:01.96 --> 00:30:04.64
Well, when I was junior, I remember this.

540
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:07.72
I see a leader lose their temper and think that's not good.

541
00:30:07.72 --> 00:30:08.72
That's negative.

542
00:30:08.72 --> 00:30:12.96
That every person in our routine right now is looking to this guy like he's an idiot

543
00:30:12.96 --> 00:30:15.28
because they're acting that way.

544
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:23.68
And then as I got older and got into leadership positions, I realized, oh, if I go negative,

545
00:30:23.68 --> 00:30:32.92
every one's going negative, if I stay positive, everyone is staying positive, that's a big deal.

546
00:30:32.92 --> 00:30:34.40
That's where it comes from.

547
00:30:34.40 --> 00:30:39.68
So then we get to this year and this is so obvious.

548
00:30:39.68 --> 00:30:44.44
I mean, you know, while I was reading this, I could see your head just nodding in affirmation

549
00:30:44.44 --> 00:30:46.44
that.

550
00:30:46.44 --> 00:30:51.32
And this is where there's a split.

551
00:30:51.32 --> 00:30:55.32
I don't know if it's a split, but there's definitely a frisier of some kind of

552
00:30:55.32 --> 00:31:01.000
fissure of some kind between people that think, hey, if I bark orders and people fear

553
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.16
me, I guess it's that one.

554
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:03.16
It's fear.

555
00:31:03.16 --> 00:31:04.64
Do they fear me or do they respect me?

556
00:31:04.64 --> 00:31:07.64
Do people fear me or do they love and respect me?

557
00:31:07.64 --> 00:31:11.92
You will get 1,000 times better leadership from people that love you and respect you than

558
00:31:11.92 --> 00:31:13.88
you will from people that are ready to you.

559
00:31:13.88 --> 00:31:17.92
Yeah, and that fear and intimidation, you get those short term wins.

560
00:31:17.92 --> 00:31:18.92
You know, we get the response.

561
00:31:18.92 --> 00:31:21.92
Yeah, that's what I said.

562
00:31:21.92 --> 00:31:22.92
Yeah, that worked.

563
00:31:22.92 --> 00:31:24.80
I got a little tactical, a little tactical victory.

564
00:31:24.80 --> 00:31:28.48
You and I talked about this all the time, the tactical versus logic.

565
00:31:28.48 --> 00:31:31.56
And that, that could be addictive.

566
00:31:31.56 --> 00:31:36.04
I tell you to do something you do it because you're afraid of the retaliation if you don't.

567
00:31:36.04 --> 00:31:38.24
If I give you any resistance, cool.

568
00:31:38.24 --> 00:31:39.88
Yeah, let me.

569
00:31:39.88 --> 00:31:42.52
Get, be, brow beat me.

570
00:31:42.52 --> 00:31:47.52
Brow beat me down and then all submit to your orders because I just don't want to be

571
00:31:47.52 --> 00:31:49.000
brow beat anymore.

572
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.40
And I go and do what you told me to do.

573
00:31:50.40 --> 00:31:52.16
And you walk away, go and see.

574
00:31:52.16 --> 00:31:53.16
That's right.

575
00:31:53.16 --> 00:31:54.16
That's how you lead.

576
00:31:54.16 --> 00:31:55.16
Yeah, I won.

577
00:31:55.16 --> 00:31:56.16
That's how you lead.

578
00:31:56.16 --> 00:31:57.16
That's how you lead.

579
00:31:57.16 --> 00:31:58.16
That's how you're talking about.

580
00:31:58.16 --> 00:31:59.84
Probably what happened is he made a aggressive decision.

581
00:31:59.84 --> 00:32:02.60
One of his leaders came back and crushed him for it.

582
00:32:02.60 --> 00:32:04.76
And had you not been there.

583
00:32:04.76 --> 00:32:08.28
That if I was thinking, I actually know what to do here to save the Patoon.

584
00:32:08.28 --> 00:32:11.84
But I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to get crushed by that guy.

585
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:14.28
And those, those teams get wiped out in training.

586
00:32:14.28 --> 00:32:15.28
Yeah.

587
00:32:15.28 --> 00:32:16.28
And all, yeah.

588
00:32:16.28 --> 00:32:22.92
So if you're, if you find yourself in a situation where you feel you need to escalate

589
00:32:22.92 --> 00:32:26.64
your emotions, you're wrong in 19 different ways.

590
00:32:26.64 --> 00:32:29.20
We get that question working with the clients all the time.

591
00:32:29.20 --> 00:32:33.52
And I've got no point in my answers is straightforward when people ask, oh, how do I

592
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:34.52
control my emotions?

593
00:32:34.52 --> 00:32:37.28
And I'm like, well, do you want to win?

594
00:32:37.28 --> 00:32:38.28
Yeah.

595
00:32:38.28 --> 00:32:39.84
I'm like a, then control your emotions.

596
00:32:39.84 --> 00:32:43.04
It's pretty much it because every time you don't, you lose.

597
00:32:43.04 --> 00:32:44.64
And don't be a robot.

598
00:32:44.64 --> 00:32:45.64
We know that.

599
00:32:45.64 --> 00:32:49.80
But that idea of like losing your mind or losing control of yourself.

600
00:32:49.80 --> 00:32:51.24
The answers I was like, do you like winning?

601
00:32:51.24 --> 00:32:52.24
Good.

602
00:32:52.24 --> 00:32:53.24
Stop doing that.

603
00:32:53.24 --> 00:32:54.24
And you'll win more.

604
00:32:54.24 --> 00:32:55.24
Yeah.

605
00:32:55.24 --> 00:32:57.88
And check, continuing.

606
00:32:57.88 --> 00:33:04.16
In spite of the advances in technology, the worth of the individual man is still decisive.

607
00:33:04.16 --> 00:33:09.52
The open order of combat accentuates, accentuates his importance.

608
00:33:09.52 --> 00:33:14.52
Every individual must be trained to exploit a situation with energy and boldness and must

609
00:33:14.52 --> 00:33:21.40
be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiative and action.

610
00:33:21.40 --> 00:33:25.88
Is there any more empowerment that a human being needs, then that right there?

611
00:33:25.88 --> 00:33:28.84
Every individual.

612
00:33:28.84 --> 00:33:33.56
Every individual must be trained to exploit a situation with energy and boldness and must

613
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:39.56
be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiatives and action.

614
00:33:39.56 --> 00:33:42.52
Again, go back to the monster.

615
00:33:42.52 --> 00:33:49.36
Our J.P. told the story of how I was like, listen, everyone's going to be relying on you.

616
00:33:49.36 --> 00:33:54.28
And he was like, hey, I've been I came up on stage afterwards and I said, what J.P. doesn't

617
00:33:54.28 --> 00:33:57.08
know is I told that to everybody.

618
00:33:57.08 --> 00:33:58.08
I told that to everyone.

619
00:33:58.08 --> 00:34:00.52
That's what I was doing was this right here.

620
00:34:00.52 --> 00:34:01.52
Everyone is going to be counting you.

621
00:34:01.52 --> 00:34:02.80
And it's the truth.

622
00:34:02.80 --> 00:34:07.72
It's the truth because if we're in a horrible situation and we need fire support, it's

623
00:34:07.72 --> 00:34:09.12
the radio man that's going to save us.

624
00:34:09.12 --> 00:34:13.32
If we're in a firefight and we need to maneuver it's the machine gunners that are going

625
00:34:13.32 --> 00:34:14.32
to save us.

626
00:34:14.32 --> 00:34:17.08
If someone gets wounded, it's the corpsman that's going to save us.

627
00:34:17.08 --> 00:34:20.40
If there's a decision that needs to be made, it's the leaders that are going to save us.

628
00:34:20.40 --> 00:34:24.56
If we're dealing with the ID credits that EOD guys are going to save us, everyone is that

629
00:34:24.56 --> 00:34:25.56
person.

630
00:34:25.56 --> 00:34:30.40
And everyone has to be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiative

631
00:34:30.40 --> 00:34:32.84
and action.

632
00:34:32.84 --> 00:34:36.56
We were talking about the one tag three a couple months ago and I'm paraphrasing whether

633
00:34:36.56 --> 00:34:41.68
there's a line on there that is like every single person on your team is critical.

634
00:34:41.68 --> 00:34:47.32
And even the most junior person has the ability to destroy your entire plan.

635
00:34:47.32 --> 00:34:48.32
Something along with the right guys.

636
00:34:48.32 --> 00:34:49.32
That was classfits right there.

637
00:34:49.32 --> 00:34:52.32
That was a classfits quote from inside the one three.

638
00:34:52.32 --> 00:34:53.32
For sure.

639
00:34:53.32 --> 00:34:54.48
Yeah.

640
00:34:54.48 --> 00:34:57.32
So they can win or they can lose.

641
00:34:57.32 --> 00:34:59.12
All right.

642
00:34:59.12 --> 00:35:03.52
Continuing the dispersion of troops in battle caused by the influence of modern weapons

643
00:35:03.52 --> 00:35:05.84
makes control more difficult.

644
00:35:05.84 --> 00:35:10.32
Or he's in within a unit is promoted by good leadership, discipline, pride in the accomplishments

645
00:35:10.32 --> 00:35:19.08
and reputation of the unit and mutual confidence and comradeship among its members.

646
00:35:19.08 --> 00:35:21.04
We're not going to be around each other.

647
00:35:21.04 --> 00:35:22.04
That's not happening.

648
00:35:22.04 --> 00:35:23.04
Yeah.

649
00:35:23.04 --> 00:35:26.56
You're on your own out there.

650
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:31.56
Leading troops in combat regardless of the echelon of command calls for cool and thoughtful

651
00:35:31.56 --> 00:35:38.80
leaders with a strong feeling of great responsibility imposed upon them extreme ownership.

652
00:35:38.80 --> 00:35:39.80
Every level.

653
00:35:39.80 --> 00:35:40.80
Detach.

654
00:35:40.80 --> 00:35:41.80
Cool.

655
00:35:41.80 --> 00:35:48.56
They must be resolute and self-reliant in their decisions energetic and insistent

656
00:35:48.56 --> 00:35:55.16
in execution and unperturbed by the fluctuations of combat.

657
00:35:55.16 --> 00:35:59.88
Oh yes.

658
00:35:59.88 --> 00:36:00.88
Who is I talking to?

659
00:36:00.88 --> 00:36:06.04
I'll talk to someone lately and they're like, do you get spun up about anything?

660
00:36:06.04 --> 00:36:08.20
And I'm like, nope.

661
00:36:08.20 --> 00:36:10.76
What am I going to get spun up about?

662
00:36:10.76 --> 00:36:11.76
Nothing.

663
00:36:11.76 --> 00:36:12.76
Yeah.

664
00:36:12.76 --> 00:36:13.88
Things are going to go bad.

665
00:36:13.88 --> 00:36:14.88
Yep.

666
00:36:14.88 --> 00:36:15.88
Things are going to go great.

667
00:36:15.88 --> 00:36:16.88
Yep.

668
00:36:16.88 --> 00:36:22.92
That's the way it's going to be.

669
00:36:22.92 --> 00:36:26.48
Troops are strongly influenced by the example and conduct of their leaders.

670
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:29.84
Again, that's the conversation I had with the O yesterday.

671
00:36:29.84 --> 00:36:33.64
A leader must have superior knowledge.

672
00:36:33.64 --> 00:36:35.44
That's why we study.

673
00:36:35.44 --> 00:36:37.80
That's why you read.

674
00:36:37.80 --> 00:36:40.84
You know, it's funny because Andrew Paul was reading this with Andrew Paul and he's like,

675
00:36:40.84 --> 00:36:44.08
it's just ridiculous.

676
00:36:44.08 --> 00:36:45.08
This is Andrew Paul talking.

677
00:36:45.08 --> 00:36:48.48
It's ridiculous that I didn't read this when I was a young lieutenant in the Sultives.

678
00:36:48.48 --> 00:36:51.12
And we went through the whole conversation about you talking about getting to stack

679
00:36:51.12 --> 00:36:52.44
of manuals at the basics.

680
00:36:52.44 --> 00:36:53.44
Cool.

681
00:36:53.44 --> 00:36:54.88
Like, hey, I'm going to read them because I have to.

682
00:36:54.88 --> 00:36:59.76
I'm going to memorize whatever words are in there that I think I'm going to get tested

683
00:36:59.76 --> 00:37:00.76
on.

684
00:37:00.76 --> 00:37:01.76
Yeah.

685
00:37:01.76 --> 00:37:04.20
But that's not what we're doing.

686
00:37:04.20 --> 00:37:05.92
That's not knowledge.

687
00:37:05.92 --> 00:37:07.48
This is knowledge.

688
00:37:07.48 --> 00:37:09.64
So a leader must have superior knowledge.

689
00:37:09.64 --> 00:37:11.92
Willpower.

690
00:37:11.92 --> 00:37:16.16
Self-confidence, initiative, and disregard of self.

691
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:17.68
There you go.

692
00:37:17.68 --> 00:37:20.04
A leader must have superior knowledge.

693
00:37:20.04 --> 00:37:25.12
Willpower, self-confidence, initiative, and disregard of self.

694
00:37:25.12 --> 00:37:28.88
I like how they had to throw that in there.

695
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:29.88
You know what that offsets?

696
00:37:29.88 --> 00:37:31.88
That offsets self-confidence.

697
00:37:31.88 --> 00:37:34.88
It offsets willpower.

698
00:37:34.88 --> 00:37:39.48
It offsets superior knowledge because disregard of self is humility.

699
00:37:39.48 --> 00:37:40.48
Right?

700
00:37:40.48 --> 00:37:41.72
Hey, that's what it is.

701
00:37:41.72 --> 00:37:43.56
I'm not important.

702
00:37:43.56 --> 00:37:45.68
I don't know everything.

703
00:37:45.68 --> 00:37:49.40
I'm not overconfident.

704
00:37:49.40 --> 00:37:50.40
Continuing.

705
00:37:50.40 --> 00:37:56.24
Any show of fear or unwillingness to share danger is fatal to leadership.

706
00:37:56.24 --> 00:37:59.64
On the other hand, a bold and determined leader will carry his troops with him no matter

707
00:37:59.64 --> 00:38:03.36
how difficult the enterprise.

708
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:10.12
Mutual confidence between the leader and his men is the surest basis of discipline.

709
00:38:10.12 --> 00:38:14.000
Now they use trust in the two-printhurum.

710
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.60
They use the word trust, same type of sentence, but mutual confidence.

711
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:26.04
And again, I'm not down there when life is a platoon commander inspecting his

712
00:38:26.04 --> 00:38:29.72
weapons once a day to make sure that they're being cleaned.

713
00:38:29.72 --> 00:38:31.92
He knows me.

714
00:38:31.92 --> 00:38:33.52
I know him.

715
00:38:33.52 --> 00:38:34.52
He trusts me.

716
00:38:34.52 --> 00:38:35.52
I trust him.

717
00:38:35.52 --> 00:38:37.80
That's the best form of discipline.

718
00:38:37.80 --> 00:38:40.60
Not imposed discipline, but mutual confidence.

719
00:38:40.60 --> 00:38:42.60
That's the accountability you talk about too.

720
00:38:42.60 --> 00:38:43.60
I hate.

721
00:38:43.60 --> 00:38:46.56
The accountability is the recognition of this needs to happen.

722
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:49.76
You know that about me because our relationship is strong enough for you to not have to

723
00:38:49.76 --> 00:38:51.76
wonder if this is important.

724
00:38:51.76 --> 00:38:56.000
It just gets done because you know what needs to get done.

725
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.92
To gain this confidence, the leader must find a way to the hearts of his men.

726
00:39:01.92 --> 00:39:02.92
Here we go.

727
00:39:02.92 --> 00:39:04.64
Isn't that kind of crazy?

728
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:05.64
Here we are.

729
00:39:05.64 --> 00:39:06.92
We're talking about military operation.

730
00:39:06.92 --> 00:39:10.92
We're talking 1941.

731
00:39:10.92 --> 00:39:14.56
1941, depression is going on.

732
00:39:14.56 --> 00:39:17.76
People are starving in America.

733
00:39:17.76 --> 00:39:21.20
And we talk about how soft things are now.

734
00:39:21.20 --> 00:39:22.20
Well, guess what?

735
00:39:22.20 --> 00:39:23.20
Here we are, 1941.

736
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:29.000
We're talking about to gain confidence, the leader must find the way to the hearts of his

737
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
men.

738
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.52
This he will do by acquiring an understanding of their thoughts and feelings and by showing

739
00:39:35.52 --> 00:39:40.84
a constant concern for their comfort and welfare.

740
00:39:40.84 --> 00:39:50.28
And as one of my heroes, General Muka Yamah said, you got to care about your management.

741
00:39:50.28 --> 00:39:52.48
You got to care about your men.

742
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:53.48
How do they say here?

743
00:39:53.48 --> 00:39:55.92
Show a constant concern for their welfare and comfort and welfare.

744
00:39:55.92 --> 00:39:56.92
Yeah, what does that mean?

745
00:39:56.92 --> 00:39:58.92
You got to care about your men.

746
00:39:58.92 --> 00:40:03.08
Yeah, for the people listening to this is not some sort of robotic action to you actually

747
00:40:03.08 --> 00:40:04.24
have to care about your men.

748
00:40:04.24 --> 00:40:11.44
This is the authenticity of this is probably more critical than anything else because what

749
00:40:11.44 --> 00:40:18.000
your men will figure out if it's not real, they'll see through that immediately.

750
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.16
I got a good idea.

751
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:22.20
If you don't care about your men, if you don't care about your troops, if you don't

752
00:40:22.20 --> 00:40:25.32
care about your people, you shouldn't be in the leadership position.

753
00:40:25.32 --> 00:40:27.12
How's that?

754
00:40:27.12 --> 00:40:28.12
Leave.

755
00:40:28.12 --> 00:40:41.08
Go and be a solo entrepreneur or be by yourself.

756
00:40:41.08 --> 00:40:46.36
A good commander avoids subjecting his troops to useless hardships.

757
00:40:46.36 --> 00:40:50.80
He guards against dissipating their combat strength and inconsequential actions or harassing

758
00:40:50.80 --> 00:40:53.64
them through faulty staff management.

759
00:40:53.64 --> 00:40:59.60
So yeah, can you go, I discipline training, train hard, train how you fight all those things.

760
00:40:59.60 --> 00:41:00.60
Can you do that too much?

761
00:41:00.60 --> 00:41:03.48
Yes, you can.

762
00:41:03.48 --> 00:41:08.32
He keeps in close touch with all subordinate units by means of personal visits and observation.

763
00:41:08.32 --> 00:41:12.88
It is essential that he know from personal contact the mental, moral and physical

764
00:41:12.88 --> 00:41:17.32
state of his troops, the conditions with which they are confronted, their accomplishments,

765
00:41:17.32 --> 00:41:20.16
their desires, their needs.

766
00:41:20.16 --> 00:41:23.76
I know your people.

767
00:41:23.76 --> 00:41:28.84
The commander should promptly extend recognition for services well done, lend help, where

768
00:41:28.84 --> 00:41:33.68
help is needed and give encouragement in adversity.

769
00:41:33.68 --> 00:41:38.96
Consider it to those whom he commands, he must be faithful and loyal to those who command

770
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:40.60
him.

771
00:41:40.60 --> 00:41:45.24
A commander must live with his troops and share their dangers and privations as well as their

772
00:41:45.24 --> 00:41:47.20
joys and sorrows.

773
00:41:47.20 --> 00:41:52.40
By personal observation and experience, he will then be able to judge their needs and combat

774
00:41:52.40 --> 00:41:57.84
value, a commander who unnecessarily taxes the endurance of his troops will only penalize

775
00:41:57.84 --> 00:41:59.28
himself.

776
00:41:59.28 --> 00:42:04.88
The proper expenditure of combat strength in proportion to the objective to be attained.

777
00:42:04.88 --> 00:42:08.92
When necessary to the execution of the mission, the commander requires and receives from

778
00:42:08.92 --> 00:42:14.64
his unit the complete measure of sacrifice.

779
00:42:14.64 --> 00:42:18.68
We can sum all that up actually in by saying, and this is what we say with them, you

780
00:42:18.68 --> 00:42:22.48
got to build relationships.

781
00:42:22.48 --> 00:42:27.20
Not get back to the comment that was made earlier is when you violate these things, when

782
00:42:27.20 --> 00:42:31.76
you don't do these things for your men, your people, you certainly hurt them, but you

783
00:42:31.76 --> 00:42:33.96
actually are hurting yourself.

784
00:42:33.96 --> 00:42:38.40
You are actually going to be the loser in the end of all this because you're not doing

785
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:39.40
things.

786
00:42:39.40 --> 00:42:44.48
Even that people should understand too is when they talk about all these different needs,

787
00:42:44.48 --> 00:42:46.12
everybody on your team is different too.

788
00:42:46.12 --> 00:42:47.36
This isn't just some blanket.

789
00:42:47.36 --> 00:42:50.36
I have a platoon of 25 or a company of 50.

790
00:42:50.36 --> 00:42:53.52
Every person's needs are going to be different and you as a leader actually need to know

791
00:42:53.52 --> 00:42:56.60
individually what all those are.

792
00:42:56.60 --> 00:42:57.76
Yes.

793
00:42:57.76 --> 00:42:59.88
And what I thought you were going to say, that's a great point.

794
00:42:59.88 --> 00:43:03.000
I thought you were going to say, when you said everybody, I said, oh, I know he's going

795
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.72
this.

796
00:43:04.72 --> 00:43:09.36
When you're doing these little maneuvers to take care of yourself, everybody, you're

797
00:43:09.36 --> 00:43:10.36
not going to be able to do that.

798
00:43:10.36 --> 00:43:11.36
How do you notice this?

799
00:43:11.36 --> 00:43:12.76
And 100 percent.

800
00:43:12.76 --> 00:43:17.88
And not only that, not only do they see it, but they think that you think that they're

801
00:43:17.88 --> 00:43:21.24
stupid and you don't notice what's happening.

802
00:43:21.24 --> 00:43:24.60
And you look like the biggest idiot in the world.

803
00:43:24.60 --> 00:43:31.68
You make these little maneuvers, you have that little space heater.

804
00:43:31.68 --> 00:43:36.48
You have that little heater in your room whenever it's freezing.

805
00:43:36.48 --> 00:43:39.48
They know that.

806
00:43:39.48 --> 00:43:46.04
You set up your, you're in a logger site and it's raining and you go into the spot where

807
00:43:46.04 --> 00:43:49.72
you're under the protection of the whatever and all the sudden you're drying, everyone

808
00:43:49.72 --> 00:43:50.72
else is wet.

809
00:43:50.72 --> 00:43:53.60
And you think no one notices that.

810
00:43:53.60 --> 00:43:54.96
They notice it.

811
00:43:54.96 --> 00:43:57.16
One hundred percent.

812
00:43:57.16 --> 00:44:02.76
And they actually are looking at you thinking, oh, you think we don't see you.

813
00:44:02.76 --> 00:44:10.20
You take, you take not just one hit for being all warm and cozy, you take two hits

814
00:44:10.20 --> 00:44:14.44
for being warm and cozy and for letting everyone know that you think they're a bunch

815
00:44:14.44 --> 00:44:15.44
of idiots.

816
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:18.16
You think you're smart, you're any idiot.

817
00:44:18.16 --> 00:44:19.16
Yeah.

818
00:44:19.16 --> 00:44:21.40
When you do that, everybody sees it.

819
00:44:21.40 --> 00:44:23.000
Everybody sees it.

820
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.40
Everybody sees it.

821
00:44:24.40 --> 00:44:30.20
Oh, I was, we had to do security on, we would capture guys my first diploma to our

822
00:44:30.20 --> 00:44:36.44
equity would capture guys and then we had to, we held them in detention ourselves.

823
00:44:36.44 --> 00:44:41.84
We like had our own little detention facility and this is just the first example that I

824
00:44:41.84 --> 00:44:43.64
thought of.

825
00:44:43.64 --> 00:44:48.68
So we would have to stand watch, you know, which sucks, you know, it's whatever.

826
00:44:48.68 --> 00:44:53.92
And in my mind, the worst watch to take, I think it was like, this is a two hour watch

827
00:44:53.92 --> 00:44:55.96
and I thought two to four, right?

828
00:44:55.96 --> 00:45:01.32
Zero 200 is zero 400, that's where you got to wake up in the middle of the night, it takes

829
00:45:01.32 --> 00:45:06.32
you 20 minutes to get there, you're all, and then you get back and you get to sleep for

830
00:45:06.32 --> 00:45:07.72
another hour before you got to wake up.

831
00:45:07.72 --> 00:45:10.36
So the two to four is the worst, worst possible watch.

832
00:45:10.36 --> 00:45:14.40
And I remember telling my assistant, Patoon Kooander, like, hey, right on, we're taking

833
00:45:14.40 --> 00:45:16.44
zero two to zero four and he's like, really?

834
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:19.72
And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, check, you knew exactly why.

835
00:45:19.72 --> 00:45:23.48
Because if I'm going to be asking everyone else to stay awake or get up early or whatever,

836
00:45:23.48 --> 00:45:27.76
we're taking the worst possible one, and, you know, you don't need to say anything about

837
00:45:27.76 --> 00:45:28.76
that.

838
00:45:28.76 --> 00:45:30.36
And no one says, hey, thanks.

839
00:45:30.36 --> 00:45:34.96
No one says that to you, but I'll tell you what, if you take the eight to ten watch,

840
00:45:34.96 --> 00:45:40.64
so you can go do your watch, wind down, go back and sleep like a normal human being,

841
00:45:40.64 --> 00:45:46.40
every single person, every single person will take note of that.

842
00:45:46.40 --> 00:45:52.52
And they'll log it down in their little, little, little mental log, but you're

843
00:45:52.52 --> 00:45:55.52
your leadership capabilities.

844
00:45:55.52 --> 00:45:58.52
So don't be an idiot.

845
00:45:58.52 --> 00:45:59.52
Everyone's watching.

846
00:45:59.52 --> 00:46:00.52
Yeah.

847
00:46:00.52 --> 00:46:01.52
And you can become that guy.

848
00:46:01.52 --> 00:46:04.52
Oh, if you do it enough, you'll become that guy.

849
00:46:04.52 --> 00:46:09.000
And then even when you figure it out, and you start to try to do the right thing, if you've

850
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.28
been that guy for so long, they'll just write it like, oh, you're just trying to do the right.

851
00:46:13.28 --> 00:46:15.28
And you can't even dig out of that hole.

852
00:46:15.28 --> 00:46:19.28
You've got to be careful, you've got to stay out of that hole from the very begin.

853
00:46:19.28 --> 00:46:23.32
If you dig yourself in that hole, then you've got to start making real sacrifices.

854
00:46:23.32 --> 00:46:24.32
Take that.

855
00:46:24.32 --> 00:46:25.32
Take that.

856
00:46:25.32 --> 00:46:26.32
Listen, don't worry about watching.

857
00:46:26.32 --> 00:46:27.32
I got it all night tonight.

858
00:46:27.32 --> 00:46:28.32
I'm just going to suck it up.

859
00:46:28.32 --> 00:46:29.32
Okay.

860
00:46:29.32 --> 00:46:31.32
And you know, he's taking one for the team, right?

861
00:46:31.32 --> 00:46:37.12
And you're going to have to do that like 40 or exactly before you reach level.

862
00:46:37.12 --> 00:46:41.04
So yeah, if you think no one's noticing that, they're noticing next.

863
00:46:41.04 --> 00:46:46.80
A spirit of unselfish cooperation with their fellows is to be fostered among officers

864
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:47.80
and men.

865
00:46:47.80 --> 00:46:52.28
So, it's a strong and incapable, must encourage and lead the week and less experienced.

866
00:46:52.28 --> 00:46:57.64
On such a foundation of feeling of true comradeship will become firmly established and

867
00:46:57.64 --> 00:47:04.28
the full combat value of the troops will be made available to the higher commander.

868
00:47:04.28 --> 00:47:10.60
Both of these, the troop and fearing and this, both talk about how the strong have to

869
00:47:10.60 --> 00:47:11.84
help the week.

870
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:17.72
It's an interesting concept because it's very easy to get the attitude of like, hey,

871
00:47:17.72 --> 00:47:18.72
that guy's sucks.

872
00:47:18.72 --> 00:47:19.72
He's a non-hant.

873
00:47:19.72 --> 00:47:20.72
And I'm not going to help him.

874
00:47:20.72 --> 00:47:21.72
Yeah.

875
00:47:21.72 --> 00:47:23.28
It's really easy to take that attitude.

876
00:47:23.28 --> 00:47:28.24
And if you have that attitude, I remember to Officer Candidate's goal.

877
00:47:28.24 --> 00:47:35.24
There was some complaining to my drone instructor who was an outstanding, obviously, an outstanding

878
00:47:35.24 --> 00:47:36.24
Marine.

879
00:47:36.24 --> 00:47:41.44
So, you know, it was like, I think we got to write little notes to him, like little

880
00:47:41.44 --> 00:47:43.28
little comments, you know what I mean?

881
00:47:43.28 --> 00:47:45.80
And he got a comment that was like, you know, some of these people just shouldn't

882
00:47:45.80 --> 00:47:46.80
be here.

883
00:47:46.80 --> 00:47:49.40
And he came out and said, hey, let's say, you know what?

884
00:47:49.40 --> 00:47:50.80
I agree with you.

885
00:47:50.80 --> 00:47:53.72
We're going to get rid of the bottom 10%.

886
00:47:53.72 --> 00:47:56.52
And so, let's say, eight people like, yeah, and then he goes, and then you know, we're

887
00:47:56.52 --> 00:48:01.60
going to have a new bottom 10% and then a new bottom 10% and then a new bottom 10% and

888
00:48:01.60 --> 00:48:08.04
then the only person that's going to graduate from our Kenna School is Jacob.

889
00:48:08.04 --> 00:48:10.88
It's like, that's what that's what it turns out to, right?

890
00:48:10.88 --> 00:48:15.32
So what you have to do and what he was trying to say to us was, hey, what you need to

891
00:48:15.32 --> 00:48:20.72
do, your whole military career, you're going to have people that need help, you're freaking

892
00:48:20.72 --> 00:48:21.72
help them.

893
00:48:21.72 --> 00:48:25.04
Yeah, and also feeds this myth that you can just fire your way to success.

894
00:48:25.04 --> 00:48:28.04
I just get rid of these guys and we'd be so good to go if I could just get rid of

895
00:48:28.04 --> 00:48:29.04
these guys.

896
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:33.76
I'm like, come on, and business who say it all the time.

897
00:48:33.76 --> 00:48:35.96
We ask people, hey, what are the people like in your company?

898
00:48:35.96 --> 00:48:38.60
And most people are hardworking and motivated and care in the tribe.

899
00:48:38.60 --> 00:48:40.64
So, what are those people need if they're struggling?

900
00:48:40.64 --> 00:48:41.64
They need help.

901
00:48:41.64 --> 00:48:43.44
That's what they need more than anything else.

902
00:48:43.44 --> 00:48:44.44
Does some people got to go?

903
00:48:44.44 --> 00:48:48.88
Yes, there are some people that got to go, but we're just going to cycle through 10% all

904
00:48:48.88 --> 00:48:49.88
the time.

905
00:48:49.88 --> 00:48:54.28
Come on, man.

906
00:48:54.28 --> 00:48:58.76
Back to the book, the combat value of a unit is determined and great measure by the soldier

907
00:48:58.76 --> 00:49:03.28
Lee qualities of its leaders and members and its will to fight.

908
00:49:03.28 --> 00:49:08.60
Outward marks of this combat value will be found in the setup and appearance of the men,

909
00:49:08.60 --> 00:49:13.16
in the condition care and maintenance of the weapons, and equipment, and in the readiness

910
00:49:13.16 --> 00:49:16.60
of the unit for action.

911
00:49:16.60 --> 00:49:20.56
Superior combat value will offset numerical inferiority.

912
00:49:20.56 --> 00:49:26.08
Superior leadership combined with some barrier combat value of troops constitutes a reliable

913
00:49:26.08 --> 00:49:29.08
basis for success in battle.

914
00:49:29.08 --> 00:49:31.44
Go, you were writing.

915
00:49:31.44 --> 00:49:33.44
I know you must have something important to say.

916
00:49:33.44 --> 00:49:36.36
Well, I was actually thinking about something that you would already said I was going to

917
00:49:36.36 --> 00:49:39.96
save her for later, but it occurred to me as you were talking about that previous comment

918
00:49:39.96 --> 00:49:42.96
about these are attributes we're talking about leaders in combat and war, and we're

919
00:49:42.96 --> 00:49:45.76
always making the connection to business and things like that.

920
00:49:45.76 --> 00:49:49.72
Here's the thing about that last comment about helping the weak.

921
00:49:49.72 --> 00:49:53.52
You can teach this at any age.

922
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:56.48
Go read the warrior kid code.

923
00:49:56.48 --> 00:50:03.72
These are lessons that you're five, six, seven year old can start to learn now and to understand

924
00:50:03.72 --> 00:50:08.52
that the best thing you can do for the weak person in your class or the person struggling

925
00:50:08.52 --> 00:50:12.64
in your soccer team or these aren't adult lessons.

926
00:50:12.64 --> 00:50:17.92
If you're a leader out there and you got kids, you can start to instill this right now.

927
00:50:17.92 --> 00:50:24.20
That lesson is not just relevant for combat or for your platoon or even for your company.

928
00:50:24.20 --> 00:50:26.92
It's relevant for everybody at every age.

929
00:50:26.92 --> 00:50:28.72
If you teach it now, think about the success.

930
00:50:28.72 --> 00:50:31.08
Your kids will have in the long run you do that.

931
00:50:31.08 --> 00:50:32.72
Anyway, just make a connection.

932
00:50:32.72 --> 00:50:45.28
Yeah, so the warrior kid, let me see what number it is.

933
00:50:45.28 --> 00:50:48.72
The bottom line is, and this is where it gets a little bit of the warrior kid, number

934
00:50:48.72 --> 00:50:49.72
five.

935
00:50:49.72 --> 00:50:52.84
The warrior kid treats people with respect and helps out other people whenever possible.

936
00:50:52.84 --> 00:50:56.48
This is where everything is beautiful in the universe.

937
00:50:56.48 --> 00:51:01.96
Everything is beautiful in the universe because when you help other people, you get better.

938
00:51:01.96 --> 00:51:04.28
Your team gets better, but you get better.

939
00:51:04.28 --> 00:51:07.16
Every time you teach something, you get better at it.

940
00:51:07.16 --> 00:51:10.000
It's just the way it works.

941
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.80
So there's like that mutual benefit.

942
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:17.32
The idea that a ham is going to get rid of someone that's weak instead of helping them

943
00:51:17.32 --> 00:51:19.68
wrong.

944
00:51:19.68 --> 00:51:24.12
The warrior kid trains hard exercises and he needs to be strong and healthy and he knows

945
00:51:24.12 --> 00:51:27.32
how to fight so he can stand up to bullies and protect the weak.

946
00:51:27.32 --> 00:51:29.28
That's something for your kids right there.

947
00:51:29.28 --> 00:51:34.36
That is the same exact thing, they say you have to protect the weak and it helps you

948
00:51:34.36 --> 00:51:36.28
when you do that.

949
00:51:36.28 --> 00:51:39.68
Yeah.

950
00:51:39.68 --> 00:51:45.72
Continuing, a poorly trained unit is likely to fail in a critical moment due to demoralizing

951
00:51:45.72 --> 00:51:49.72
impressions caused by unexpected events in combat.

952
00:51:49.72 --> 00:51:53.20
This is particularly true in the first engagements of a unit.

953
00:51:53.20 --> 00:51:58.68
Therefore, training and discipline are of great importance.

954
00:51:58.68 --> 00:52:05.60
Reliever must take energetic action against the indescipline, panic, pillage and other disruptive

955
00:52:05.60 --> 00:52:06.60
forces.

956
00:52:06.60 --> 00:52:12.40
Discipline is the main cohesive force that binds the members of a unit.

957
00:52:12.40 --> 00:52:14.60
Discipline is the main cohesive force that binds.

958
00:52:14.60 --> 00:52:16.24
You know, it's interesting.

959
00:52:16.24 --> 00:52:21.92
I think we were covering SLA Marshall's men under fire and he's talking about when units

960
00:52:21.92 --> 00:52:27.48
got routed and when like mayhem broke, since people start running away.

961
00:52:27.48 --> 00:52:34.80
They have documented cases where the platoon leader up in the front line goes, hey, runner,

962
00:52:34.80 --> 00:52:37.20
go back and tell headquarters we need more ammunition.

963
00:52:37.20 --> 00:52:40.04
He goes, cool, got it, get something to start running.

964
00:52:40.04 --> 00:52:44.04
Someone sees him running and goes, oh, dang, we're running.

965
00:52:44.04 --> 00:52:48.32
So someone else gets up and then next thing you know, everyone is running.

966
00:52:48.32 --> 00:52:51.80
From one person just seeing it happen.

967
00:52:51.80 --> 00:52:54.60
And once again, that's what that's what we're talking with.

968
00:52:54.60 --> 00:53:01.08
Theo yesterday, the way you act as a leader, you got to act correctly.

969
00:53:01.08 --> 00:53:04.000
If you start to panic, if you start to freak out, if you start to lose your temper, if

970
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.12
you start to lose your mind, everyone else is going to do the same thing.

971
00:53:06.12 --> 00:53:07.76
If you run away, everyone's going to do the same.

972
00:53:07.76 --> 00:53:12.48
If you go forward, everyone's going to follow you.

973
00:53:12.48 --> 00:53:18.52
And yes, discipline is the main cohesive force that binds the members of a unit together.

974
00:53:18.52 --> 00:53:22.68
A wise and capable commander will see that the men assigned to the competent groups and

975
00:53:22.68 --> 00:53:28.40
of his unit are compatible and that the composition of the groups is changed as little

976
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:29.68
as possible.

977
00:53:29.68 --> 00:53:32.68
All right.

978
00:53:32.68 --> 00:53:34.80
So I'll read that one more time.

979
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:38.92
A wise and capable commander will see that the men assigned to the competent groups of

980
00:53:38.92 --> 00:53:41.04
the unit are compatible.

981
00:53:41.04 --> 00:53:45.40
So they can interoperate, and they can change around.

982
00:53:45.40 --> 00:53:50.44
And that the compositions of his group groups is changed as little as possible.

983
00:53:50.44 --> 00:53:56.08
So when you have little subunits, keep them together.

984
00:53:56.08 --> 00:53:58.28
Keep them together.

985
00:53:58.28 --> 00:54:02.60
That's, they get to know each other, they get to understand each other, they can read

986
00:54:02.60 --> 00:54:06.64
out, read each other, and that's the way you need to work.

987
00:54:06.64 --> 00:54:09.48
They don't need to be freaking redevelop a relationship.

988
00:54:09.48 --> 00:54:11.12
They already have it.

989
00:54:11.12 --> 00:54:18.000
When task unit bruiser went through our urban training, and we had a bunch of strap hangers

990
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
with us.

991
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:25.96
We had a bunch of other people, EOD people, some other, we probably had an additional

992
00:54:25.96 --> 00:54:29.12
like 15 people with our task unit.

993
00:54:29.12 --> 00:54:38.24
And so the initial reaction from from life and Seth was, they put those guys, you know,

994
00:54:38.24 --> 00:54:40.28
that's two other squads.

995
00:54:40.28 --> 00:54:42.88
We don't want them in our cartoon.

996
00:54:42.88 --> 00:54:47.68
And I was like, no, what we're going to do is we're going to take one or two of them

997
00:54:47.68 --> 00:54:52.96
and put them in each one of our fire teams and make them part of our unit.

998
00:54:52.96 --> 00:54:55.80
And, you know, they objected.

999
00:54:55.80 --> 00:55:01.08
But what happens, what happens is that those people get individually, it's very easy for

1000
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:04.24
a four or five-man fire team to absorb a one or two people.

1001
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:05.24
Yeah.

1002
00:55:05.24 --> 00:55:06.24
Hey, cool.

1003
00:55:06.24 --> 00:55:07.24
What's your name?

1004
00:55:07.24 --> 00:55:08.24
Fred, cool.

1005
00:55:08.24 --> 00:55:09.24
Right on.

1006
00:55:09.24 --> 00:55:10.24
You're good.

1007
00:55:10.24 --> 00:55:11.24
Hey, I'm Bill.

1008
00:55:11.24 --> 00:55:12.24
Let me know.

1009
00:55:12.24 --> 00:55:13.24
Here's what I'm at.

1010
00:55:13.24 --> 00:55:14.24
Here's how we do our head count.

1011
00:55:14.24 --> 00:55:15.24
Here's what we're looking for.

1012
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:16.24
Boom.

1013
00:55:16.24 --> 00:55:17.24
Integration was almost immediate.

1014
00:55:17.24 --> 00:55:22.32
We have now when it was time to assault a building and we call them sections, because

1015
00:55:22.32 --> 00:55:23.32
they weren't really fire teams.

1016
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:24.32
They were a little bit bigger now.

1017
00:55:24.32 --> 00:55:29.44
So I called them sections and which is I stole from the grom, which is the Polish special

1018
00:55:29.44 --> 00:55:31.80
operations that I worked to turn with my first diploma to Baghdad.

1019
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:33.64
They called the ad sections of like six guys.

1020
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:34.64
I was like, cool.

1021
00:55:34.64 --> 00:55:37.28
We're going to have sections now because we were a little bit bigger than a fire team.

1022
00:55:37.28 --> 00:55:38.28
Cool.

1023
00:55:38.28 --> 00:55:44.60
And then it was like sections two, three and four assault section one, a whole fast and everyone

1024
00:55:44.60 --> 00:55:46.000
knows what to do.

1025
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.24
You got little micro section leaders that are making things happen.

1026
00:55:49.24 --> 00:55:50.24
Yeah.

1027
00:55:50.24 --> 00:55:51.24
That doesn't happen.

1028
00:55:51.24 --> 00:55:53.24
You take the six new guys and give them their own sex.

1029
00:55:53.24 --> 00:55:54.24
Yeah.

1030
00:55:54.24 --> 00:55:55.24
Yeah.

1031
00:55:55.24 --> 00:55:56.24
Yeah.

1032
00:55:56.24 --> 00:55:57.24
Yeah.

1033
00:55:57.24 --> 00:55:58.24
No.

1034
00:55:58.24 --> 00:55:58.60
And then you take, then you have three of those, right?

1035
00:55:58.60 --> 00:56:04.36
Which is probably what we would have had three sections of people just randomly out

1036
00:56:04.36 --> 00:56:05.36
there.

1037
00:56:05.36 --> 00:56:07.36
By the way, and those people weren't even integrated as a unit.

1038
00:56:07.36 --> 00:56:09.44
It wasn't like it was a separate platoon.

1039
00:56:09.44 --> 00:56:12.56
If it was a full pl- another platoon of seals, that would have made some sense.

1040
00:56:12.56 --> 00:56:13.56
Okay, cool.

1041
00:56:13.56 --> 00:56:16.16
The platoon seals, they have their broken into fire.

1042
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:17.16
Yes.

1043
00:56:17.16 --> 00:56:18.16
Okay, cool.

1044
00:56:18.16 --> 00:56:19.16
We get it.

1045
00:56:19.16 --> 00:56:20.16
We can command that.

1046
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:24.92
But we have 16, 15, 20 random people that haven't been working together.

1047
00:56:24.92 --> 00:56:25.92
Cool.

1048
00:56:25.92 --> 00:56:26.92
Guess what?

1049
00:56:26.92 --> 00:56:28.44
You're about to report to a leader in task in a bruiser.

1050
00:56:28.44 --> 00:56:34.56
This is petty officer's second class, get some.

1051
00:56:34.56 --> 00:56:35.72
But that's what you wanted to do.

1052
00:56:35.72 --> 00:56:37.56
You want to keep your team together.

1053
00:56:37.56 --> 00:56:38.56
Continuing.

1054
00:56:38.56 --> 00:56:42.08
He will provide each group with a leader in whom its members have confidence.

1055
00:56:42.08 --> 00:56:43.08
That's another thing.

1056
00:56:43.08 --> 00:56:46.28
So now you got the task being a bruiser guys.

1057
00:56:46.28 --> 00:56:47.52
Everyone knows that fire team leader.

1058
00:56:47.52 --> 00:56:49.80
They don't have to meet Fred.

1059
00:56:49.80 --> 00:56:52.12
That guy who's at the jump team for eight years.

1060
00:56:52.12 --> 00:56:53.12
He doesn't know what he's doing.

1061
00:56:53.12 --> 00:56:54.12
No, it doesn't matter.

1062
00:56:54.12 --> 00:56:55.96
You know, Fred's on board with the program.

1063
00:56:55.96 --> 00:56:58.96
He wants the win.

1064
00:56:58.96 --> 00:57:03.40
He will so regulate the interior administration of the units that all groups perform

1065
00:57:03.40 --> 00:57:06.12
the same amount of work and enjoy the same amount of leisure.

1066
00:57:06.12 --> 00:57:10.72
He will see that demonstrated efficiency is promptly recognized and rewarded.

1067
00:57:10.72 --> 00:57:15.44
You will set before all the high standard of military conduct and apply the same rules

1068
00:57:15.44 --> 00:57:17.60
of discipline to all.

1069
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:19.56
Here's a good one.

1070
00:57:19.56 --> 00:57:25.60
Good morale and a sense of unity in a command cannot be improvised.

1071
00:57:25.60 --> 00:57:29.28
They must be thoroughly planned and systematically promoted.

1072
00:57:29.28 --> 00:57:34.56
They are born of just in fair treatment, a constant concern for the soldiers welfare.

1073
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:36.44
Oh, you want to build morale?

1074
00:57:36.44 --> 00:57:37.44
There you go.

1075
00:57:37.44 --> 00:57:40.12
A constant concern for the soldiers welfare.

1076
00:57:40.12 --> 00:57:45.56
They are all training in basic duties, comrade ship among men and pride in self, organization

1077
00:57:45.56 --> 00:57:48.84
and country.

1078
00:57:48.84 --> 00:57:51.24
Morales a byproduct of your leadership.

1079
00:57:51.24 --> 00:57:53.76
Good leaders have units with good morale.

1080
00:57:53.76 --> 00:57:55.04
Bad leaders don't.

1081
00:57:55.04 --> 00:57:56.04
Period.

1082
00:57:56.04 --> 00:57:57.04
Yeah.

1083
00:57:57.04 --> 00:58:00.64
The Marine Corps does a damn good job of this one, don't they?

1084
00:58:00.64 --> 00:58:04.64
I mean, I mean, the military doesn't general about damn the Marine Corps.

1085
00:58:04.64 --> 00:58:05.64
Good at that.

1086
00:58:05.64 --> 00:58:09.24
Because when you're in the Marine Corps, you're in the Marine Corps.

1087
00:58:09.24 --> 00:58:13.52
That's just the way it is.

1088
00:58:13.52 --> 00:58:20.24
The establishment and maintenance of good morale are incumbent upon every commander and

1089
00:58:20.24 --> 00:58:25.80
are the marks of good leadership, which is what you just said.

1090
00:58:25.80 --> 00:58:29.56
And then we get to number 111.

1091
00:58:29.56 --> 00:58:35.000
The first demand in war is decisive action.

1092
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.16
Commanders inspire confidence in their subordinates by their decisive conduct and their ability

1093
00:58:39.16 --> 00:58:41.88
to gain material advantage over the enemy.

1094
00:58:41.88 --> 00:58:46.40
A reputation for failure in a leader destroys morale.

1095
00:58:46.40 --> 00:58:52.68
The morale of a unit is that of its leader.

1096
00:58:52.68 --> 00:58:55.16
Again, that's what you just said.

1097
00:58:55.16 --> 00:58:58.96
But hey, the first demand in war is decisive action.

1098
00:58:58.96 --> 00:59:01.44
And again, it talks about the southern metropolitan.

1099
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:04.40
An age of all gave a great example.

1100
00:59:04.40 --> 00:59:08.56
You know, decisive action doesn't mean you just make the full commitment to a decision

1101
00:59:08.56 --> 00:59:12.60
and he gave that example of looking at your Google Maps.

1102
00:59:12.60 --> 00:59:18.16
You've got to walk through the city to a place and it's two miles away.

1103
00:59:18.16 --> 00:59:24.32
And so you walk out of the hotel and you look at your Google Maps and the arrow is just spinning.

1104
00:59:24.32 --> 00:59:25.68
Because you're not going anywhere.

1105
00:59:25.68 --> 00:59:26.68
Cool.

1106
00:59:26.68 --> 00:59:27.68
Start walking.

1107
00:59:27.68 --> 00:59:28.68
Take 10 steps.

1108
00:59:28.68 --> 00:59:31.68
That thing will self-correct because now you'll know where you're supposed to be going.

1109
00:59:31.68 --> 00:59:33.68
So that's a decisive action.

1110
00:59:33.68 --> 00:59:37.32
Sitting there, not doing anything, isn't getting you anywhere.

1111
00:59:37.32 --> 00:59:39.24
That the enemy's maneuvering on you, by the way.

1112
00:59:39.24 --> 00:59:40.24
Yeah.

1113
00:59:40.24 --> 00:59:43.12
And that flip side you talked about is, hey, we want to get into this space.

1114
00:59:43.12 --> 00:59:44.12
Well, that's by three buildings.

1115
00:59:44.12 --> 00:59:45.12
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1116
00:59:45.12 --> 00:59:46.12
Hang on.

1117
00:59:46.12 --> 00:59:49.44
We actually, that is overly, that's way overly aggressive.

1118
00:59:49.44 --> 00:59:51.72
And actually, isn't what you need.

1119
00:59:51.72 --> 00:59:55.44
Yeah, that example was awesome.

1120
00:59:55.44 --> 01:00:02.28
A commander must bear in mind that physical unfitness will undermine his efficiency.

1121
01:00:02.28 --> 01:00:06.52
And actually, surprisingly, I don't think this is in the trooping

1122
01:00:06.52 --> 01:00:07.52
fury at all.

1123
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:11.28
I don't think they talk about physical fitness in this much clarity.

1124
01:00:11.28 --> 01:00:16.60
A commander must bear in mind that physical unfitness will undermine his efficiency.

1125
01:00:16.60 --> 01:00:23.96
He owes it to the men under his command to conserve his own fitness.

1126
01:00:23.96 --> 01:00:29.16
neglect renders him, unable to bring a normal mind to the solution of his problems

1127
01:00:29.16 --> 01:00:34.16
and reacts unfavorable on his whole command.

1128
01:00:34.16 --> 01:00:36.48
That is, that is a heavy statement.

1129
01:00:36.48 --> 01:00:44.60
Here's the thing that, you know, that term fatigue will make a coward out of any

1130
01:00:44.60 --> 01:00:45.60
man.

1131
01:00:45.60 --> 01:00:53.08
Like when you get tired, it's, you start making bad decisions and you can't maintain.

1132
01:00:53.08 --> 01:00:55.60
So that's what this is.

1133
01:00:55.60 --> 01:01:02.60
And if you're the better physical condition you're in, the more you'll be able to

1134
01:01:02.60 --> 01:01:03.60
maintain for.

1135
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:07.08
You know, people freak out because I don't sleep a lot, which I, I'm not, I don't encourage

1136
01:01:07.08 --> 01:01:09.32
people not to sleep a lot.

1137
01:01:09.32 --> 01:01:10.64
You should sleep as much sleep as you need.

1138
01:01:10.64 --> 01:01:11.64
Get it, bunch of sleep.

1139
01:01:11.64 --> 01:01:12.64
It's great.

1140
01:01:12.64 --> 01:01:14.64
I know the sleep diplomat guy sleep.

1141
01:01:14.64 --> 01:01:16.72
I'm not against that sleep.

1142
01:01:16.72 --> 01:01:23.000
But what I, I will say is this, like if you're in good physical condition and you eat well,

1143
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.68
you will not need as much sleep.

1144
01:01:25.68 --> 01:01:29.80
I'm here to tell you, like, well, at least I don't think you do.

1145
01:01:29.80 --> 01:01:34.20
I was talking about with with with with Flynn Cochran the other day on being on the road

1146
01:01:34.20 --> 01:01:35.04
all the time.

1147
01:01:35.04 --> 01:01:37.04
And so sometimes we're on the road.

1148
01:01:37.04 --> 01:01:41.88
I flew literally to Maine 36 hours ago and I flew back the very next day.

1149
01:01:41.88 --> 01:01:47.72
I was on the road and and the the best thing you can do in the situation where you're going

1150
01:01:47.72 --> 01:01:49.72
to be tired is actually go workout for sure.

1151
01:01:49.72 --> 01:01:51.04
I mean, it's the best thing you can do.

1152
01:01:51.04 --> 01:01:55.12
And the days that I get them like, I have to work out at 330 and I don't, I regret

1153
01:01:55.12 --> 01:01:56.12
at the entire day.

1154
01:01:56.12 --> 01:01:57.12
Yeah.

1155
01:01:57.12 --> 01:02:03.20
I never once heard you say you don't need sleep, but what the reality is is is when

1156
01:02:03.20 --> 01:02:09.04
you're tired, the best thing you can do is get out of bed and do something physical.

1157
01:02:09.04 --> 01:02:10.04
Yeah.

1158
01:02:10.04 --> 01:02:12.12
Is the best way to without a doubt.

1159
01:02:12.12 --> 01:02:13.12
Yeah.

1160
01:02:13.12 --> 01:02:16.96
And yeah, it's physical fitness.

1161
01:02:16.96 --> 01:02:17.96
Don't neglect it.

1162
01:02:17.96 --> 01:02:19.56
And that that happens a lot of times in business.

1163
01:02:19.56 --> 01:02:21.68
People get wrapped in the business.

1164
01:02:21.68 --> 01:02:26.000
And if you don't make some time to stay physically fit, strategic look, there's going to be

1165
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
times in business.

1166
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.84
There's times in echelon front.

1167
01:02:27.84 --> 01:02:33.92
There's times in our lives where, hey man, you like, I don't, I can't do my normal workouts

1168
01:02:33.92 --> 01:02:35.56
during the master.

1169
01:02:35.56 --> 01:02:37.24
Like we do, we do, we work out.

1170
01:02:37.24 --> 01:02:39.44
But it's not, it's not my normal workout.

1171
01:02:39.44 --> 01:02:43.36
It's a workout that takes 40 minutes, not and it's only one a day.

1172
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:44.92
You know, so that's not normal.

1173
01:02:44.92 --> 01:02:46.80
But we get to suck it up for the master.

1174
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:54.68
It's, you know, four or five days of us very, very work intensive.

1175
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:57.52
But when that's over, man, you've got to get right back into it.

1176
01:02:57.52 --> 01:03:00.000
So people that go, hey, I get it.

1177
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.92
You've got some project to do and you've got a week where you can only work out for 10 minutes

1178
01:03:04.92 --> 01:03:08.40
a day, eight minutes a day, 28 minutes a day, whatever.

1179
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:09.40
Cool.

1180
01:03:09.40 --> 01:03:10.40
Get it.

1181
01:03:10.40 --> 01:03:11.40
I get it.

1182
01:03:11.40 --> 01:03:16.16
If you don't work out and then all of a sudden you can develop that habit, well, then you

1183
01:03:16.16 --> 01:03:21.12
have to bear in mind that the physical unfitness is going to undermine your efficiency period

1184
01:03:21.12 --> 01:03:22.12
in the story.

1185
01:03:22.12 --> 01:03:29.12
So that's the closest out leadership.

1186
01:03:29.12 --> 01:03:34.28
The next chapter is called the exercise of command.

1187
01:03:34.28 --> 01:03:38.88
Doctrins of combat chapter four.

1188
01:03:38.88 --> 01:03:42.12
Here's where we give credit good writing, solid statement.

1189
01:03:42.12 --> 01:03:46.56
The ultimate objective of all military operations is the destruction of the enemies armed

1190
01:03:46.56 --> 01:03:49.68
forces in battle.

1191
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:52.20
That's those simple statements like that.

1192
01:03:52.20 --> 01:03:56.80
It's interesting when we go work with companies and no one, everyone is completely lost

1193
01:03:56.80 --> 01:03:58.96
track of what it is that they're trying to do.

1194
01:03:58.96 --> 01:03:59.96
Yeah.

1195
01:03:59.96 --> 01:04:00.96
What's your mission?

1196
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:01.96
Yep.

1197
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:08.24
The ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most decisively and quickly

1198
01:04:08.24 --> 01:04:14.40
to the defeat of the hostile armed forces is one attribute of the able commander.

1199
01:04:14.40 --> 01:04:15.40
What does that mean?

1200
01:04:15.40 --> 01:04:20.68
A good leader has the ability to prioritize and execute the most important things already

1201
01:04:20.68 --> 01:04:21.68
to begin.

1202
01:04:21.68 --> 01:04:27.52
The ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most decisively and quickly

1203
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:32.80
to defeat the hostile armed forces is one attribute of the able commander.

1204
01:04:32.80 --> 01:04:34.36
That is prioritized next.

1205
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:35.72
You got to pick the most important thing.

1206
01:04:35.72 --> 01:04:37.32
What are they calling here?

1207
01:04:37.32 --> 01:04:43.04
The objective, whose attainment contributes most decisively.

1208
01:04:43.04 --> 01:04:44.04
That's the most important thing.

1209
01:04:44.04 --> 01:04:46.80
That's what you're going to focus on.

1210
01:04:46.80 --> 01:04:47.80
Prioritize an execute.

1211
01:04:47.80 --> 01:04:54.04
Next, simple and direct plans and methods with prompt and thorough executioner often

1212
01:04:54.04 --> 01:04:56.48
decisive in the attainment of success.

1213
01:04:56.48 --> 01:05:00.68
That is almost verbatim from group and fear of it.

1214
01:05:00.68 --> 01:05:02.56
Almost the exact same thing.

1215
01:05:02.56 --> 01:05:05.32
You got to keep things simple.

1216
01:05:05.32 --> 01:05:09.80
People been saying that forever.

1217
01:05:09.80 --> 01:05:15.16
Unity of command obtains that unity of effort, which is essential to the decisive

1218
01:05:15.16 --> 01:05:18.96
application of full combat power of the available forces.

1219
01:05:18.96 --> 01:05:25.48
Unity of effort is furthered by full cooperation between elements of the command.

1220
01:05:25.48 --> 01:05:27.08
Yes, prioritize an execute.

1221
01:05:27.08 --> 01:05:33.52
Figure out what's most important and then cover and move for each other as you execute.

1222
01:05:33.52 --> 01:05:41.80
Ext through offensive action, a commander exercises his initiative, preserves his freedom

1223
01:05:41.80 --> 01:05:46.76
of action and imposes his will on the enemy.

1224
01:05:46.76 --> 01:05:48.64
Boom, there you go.

1225
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:51.64
What is that offensive action?

1226
01:05:51.64 --> 01:05:54.20
Being on the offense, not being on the defense.

1227
01:05:54.20 --> 01:05:58.64
Think of what it does for you as a person, as a human, as a leader.

1228
01:05:58.64 --> 01:06:03.76
It exercises your initiative, preserves your freedom of action and imposes your will on the

1229
01:06:03.76 --> 01:06:05.08
enemy.

1230
01:06:05.08 --> 01:06:08.76
You got to go on offense.

1231
01:06:08.76 --> 01:06:14.92
A defensive attitude may, however, be deliberately adopted as a temporary expedient while

1232
01:06:14.92 --> 01:06:17.56
awaiting an opportunity for counter offensive action.

1233
01:06:17.56 --> 01:06:21.24
Hey, look, sometimes you got to be defensive or made a budget better be looking for that

1234
01:06:21.24 --> 01:06:23.40
moment to go back on the offense.

1235
01:06:23.40 --> 01:06:29.08
The defensive posture is designed to find the opportunity to go on the defensive.

1236
01:06:29.08 --> 01:06:30.08
Go on the offensive.

1237
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:32.08
That's why you're doing it.

1238
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:34.76
If you're on the defense, this is so clear in Gitu.

1239
01:06:34.76 --> 01:06:39.04
If you're on defense in Gitu and you stay on defense, you will lose.

1240
01:06:39.04 --> 01:06:40.68
Eventually you're going to get caught.

1241
01:06:40.68 --> 01:06:42.68
You can only defend so much and they're attacking.

1242
01:06:42.68 --> 01:06:43.84
They have the initiative.

1243
01:06:43.84 --> 01:06:45.12
They have the freedom of action.

1244
01:06:45.12 --> 01:06:46.60
They're imposing their will on you.

1245
01:06:46.60 --> 01:06:49.60
You can defend for a little while, but eventually you're going to get taken.

1246
01:06:49.60 --> 01:06:50.76
You're going to get submitted.

1247
01:06:50.76 --> 01:06:51.76
It's same in flying.

1248
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:56.80
And there is a comment in there that I think it's the describe the freedom of movement.

1249
01:06:56.80 --> 01:06:59.24
It's a thing we talk about all the time as the attribute to make sure that you're doing

1250
01:06:59.24 --> 01:07:01.96
it correctly is, can you still maneuver?

1251
01:07:01.96 --> 01:07:04.88
So you can't be so offensive that you no longer can maneuver.

1252
01:07:04.88 --> 01:07:08.68
But the ability to maneuver in that position is what allows you to find the opportunity

1253
01:07:08.68 --> 01:07:15.12
to exploit and then go on the offensive to preserve your maneuvering room is the part that

1254
01:07:15.12 --> 01:07:16.76
you're balanced in those.

1255
01:07:16.76 --> 01:07:18.80
So how do you over commit an aircraft?

1256
01:07:18.80 --> 01:07:23.92
Actually, it's easy and it happens all the time and you have the aircraft have potential

1257
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:28.52
energy or capability and if you're maneuver to get closer or whatever you're trying

1258
01:07:28.52 --> 01:07:32.20
to do with another aircraft, if you overdo that and then at your next move you don't have

1259
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:34.68
any energy to turn the aircraft.

1260
01:07:34.68 --> 01:07:35.68
You're going to lose.

1261
01:07:35.68 --> 01:07:38.000
And that can happen in the most powerful airplane in the world.

1262
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.92
I could be an arraptor and if I turn it really hard and actually turn it too hard and my

1263
01:07:41.92 --> 01:07:44.92
energy goes from three inch and knots to 100 knots.

1264
01:07:44.92 --> 01:07:50.000
I haven't allowed myself to kill them at that move so I need another move on the chessboard

1265
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.36
and there's no energy left.

1266
01:07:51.36 --> 01:07:55.96
I literally can't maneuver and I will lose to an inferior platform.

1267
01:07:55.96 --> 01:08:01.96
So when you're riding a bicycle, if you're going slow, it's harder to stay balanced

1268
01:08:01.96 --> 01:08:02.96
and it's harder to turn.

1269
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:08.72
Is that the same thing like when you're in an aircraft, you do certain amount of speed?

1270
01:08:08.72 --> 01:08:11.08
There's a point at which and it's measured.

1271
01:08:11.08 --> 01:08:15.60
You know what that point is, is where your maneuvering gets to a peak and then starts to diminish

1272
01:08:15.60 --> 01:08:17.84
and then you can no longer maneuver based on that speed.

1273
01:08:17.84 --> 01:08:18.84
And that's speed.

1274
01:08:18.84 --> 01:08:20.32
That's solely based on speed.

1275
01:08:20.32 --> 01:08:21.32
It's exactly right.

1276
01:08:21.32 --> 01:08:23.40
Or it would call potential energy.

1277
01:08:23.40 --> 01:08:24.68
You might need altitude.

1278
01:08:24.68 --> 01:08:26.96
You would descend to get that energy back.

1279
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:30.52
But it's a combination of the actual air speed, the number in your display, 100 miles in

1280
01:08:30.52 --> 01:08:33.64
our arraptor, whatever it is and how much altitude that you have.

1281
01:08:33.64 --> 01:08:37.92
And the ground is the ground and so if you cannot descend, whatever your air speed is,

1282
01:08:37.92 --> 01:08:39.20
that's what you have left.

1283
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:43.92
It's, we call it potential energy, but it boils down to how much maneuvering air speed do

1284
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:44.92
you have.

1285
01:08:44.92 --> 01:08:48.12
How fast is a raptor have to be going?

1286
01:08:48.12 --> 01:08:49.60
So it doesn't stall.

1287
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:53.96
Well that number happens to be extremely low and the irony in that is a lot of people

1288
01:08:53.96 --> 01:08:58.52
don't understand is that your minimum controllable air speed is a critical component.

1289
01:08:58.52 --> 01:09:03.20
So the slow r I can go and be maneuverable is a huge advantage for me.

1290
01:09:03.20 --> 01:09:07.44
But every aircraft has a limit that if you get past whatever that number is, you're out

1291
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:09.40
of maneuvering air speed and you're going to lose.

1292
01:09:09.40 --> 01:09:13.20
You have to have the ability to maneuver no matter what situation you're in to include being

1293
01:09:13.20 --> 01:09:14.68
on the defensive.

1294
01:09:14.68 --> 01:09:17.52
And that's what they're talking about is I'm going to stay in this position until I see

1295
01:09:17.52 --> 01:09:20.64
the opportunity to go the offensive and I'm going to maneuver in that position.

1296
01:09:20.64 --> 01:09:23.44
What was that standard move that you do when you don't know what to do?

1297
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:25.48
Lift vector on and pull.

1298
01:09:25.48 --> 01:09:29.20
Point of the guy and turn until you figure out what you need to do next.

1299
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:30.20
Lift vector.

1300
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:31.20
Vector.

1301
01:09:31.20 --> 01:09:33.32
To essentially where your airplane is going in this guy.

1302
01:09:33.32 --> 01:09:36.96
And if you don't know what to do, you put your lift vector directly on your opponent.

1303
01:09:36.96 --> 01:09:41.84
You point directly at him and you start to maneuver towards directly towards him.

1304
01:09:41.84 --> 01:09:44.000
That doesn't mean it's the right move.

1305
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It means because you don't know what the right move is, you have to be doing something.

1306
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.28
Because if you sit there and do nothing, which is sort of the ultimate defensive position

1307
01:09:52.28 --> 01:09:58.12
is I'm just going to hole up and bury, you're going to die so quickly.

1308
01:09:58.12 --> 01:09:59.12
Go on the offense.

1309
01:09:59.12 --> 01:10:00.64
Go on the offense.

1310
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:04.60
Even if you're not 100% sure what to do, go on the offense.

1311
01:10:04.60 --> 01:10:09.68
If a defensive posture is actually a decision you make by design.

1312
01:10:09.68 --> 01:10:13.56
Going on the offensive, if you don't know what to do, if it's only your maneuvering,

1313
01:10:13.56 --> 01:10:16.92
the more training the more reps you have, the sooner you're going to figure out what to do.

1314
01:10:16.92 --> 01:10:22.60
The default aggressive mindset of going on the offensive, what doesn't that apply?

1315
01:10:22.60 --> 01:10:27.40
Yeah, I mean, and this is something that Andrew and I talked about.

1316
01:10:27.40 --> 01:10:30.08
You obviously, you don't just commit.

1317
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:33.48
And once you, what you just said, you just don't commit ignorantly.

1318
01:10:33.48 --> 01:10:35.04
No, and you don't over commit.

1319
01:10:35.04 --> 01:10:40.40
You make the small decisions, even lift vector on and pull.

1320
01:10:40.40 --> 01:10:44.88
Even that, that's like an adjustment, but then you're immediately, you're just under the

1321
01:10:44.88 --> 01:10:45.88
you to loop.

1322
01:10:45.88 --> 01:10:50.40
That's your 10 steps down the road to get orient to that Andrew just described.

1323
01:10:50.40 --> 01:10:54.56
And as soon as you, okay, I've got it figured out now you go do something else.

1324
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:57.92
You've got to keep that maneuvering speed.

1325
01:10:57.92 --> 01:11:01.80
Continue on, the selection by the commander of the right time in place for offensive action

1326
01:11:01.80 --> 01:11:06.04
is a decisive factor in the success of the operation.

1327
01:11:06.04 --> 01:11:11.76
New miracle inferiority does not necessarily commit a command to a defensive attitude.

1328
01:11:11.76 --> 01:11:17.08
Superior hostile numbers may be overcome through greater mobility, better armament, and

1329
01:11:17.08 --> 01:11:24.36
equipment, more effective fire, higher morale, and better leadership.

1330
01:11:24.36 --> 01:11:29.72
Superior leadership often enables a numerically inferior force to be stronger at the point

1331
01:11:29.72 --> 01:11:33.76
of decisive action.

1332
01:11:33.76 --> 01:11:35.80
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

1333
01:11:35.80 --> 01:11:37.52
So legit.

1334
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:39.80
Mobility.

1335
01:11:39.80 --> 01:11:44.24
Arm better armament and equipment, more effective fire, higher morale.

1336
01:11:44.24 --> 01:11:45.88
Isn't it interesting?

1337
01:11:45.88 --> 01:11:48.12
Everyone would think better armament, right?

1338
01:11:48.12 --> 01:11:50.88
Everyone would think better equipment.

1339
01:11:50.88 --> 01:11:54.28
Most people would think better, effective fire, but higher morale.

1340
01:11:54.28 --> 01:11:58.12
Just having higher morale is an element in achieving victory even if you're an

1341
01:11:58.12 --> 01:12:02.64
a numerically inferior position.

1342
01:12:02.64 --> 01:12:07.48
A strategically defensive mission is frequently most effectively executed through offensive

1343
01:12:07.48 --> 01:12:08.48
action.

1344
01:12:08.48 --> 01:12:14.40
It is often necessary for an inferior force to strike at an early moment in order to secure

1345
01:12:14.40 --> 01:12:19.20
initial advantages or to prevent itself from being overwhelmed by a growing superior

1346
01:12:19.20 --> 01:12:23.12
or the enhanced forces.

1347
01:12:23.12 --> 01:12:27.68
If you run a company and you're the smaller company that you're competing with your

1348
01:12:27.68 --> 01:12:30.04
competitors, being defensive is going to get you killed.

1349
01:12:30.04 --> 01:12:33.92
You're going to get run over by this bigger company because they're going to use the

1350
01:12:33.92 --> 01:12:36.12
resources and size to bulldoze you.

1351
01:12:36.12 --> 01:12:38.52
You have to be poised to strike, go on the offensive.

1352
01:12:38.52 --> 01:12:39.96
The first opportunity you can.

1353
01:12:39.96 --> 01:12:42.96
That is the right opportunity to do that.

1354
01:12:42.96 --> 01:12:44.28
It's interesting in jujitsu.

1355
01:12:44.28 --> 01:12:47.000
The same thing happens.

1356
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.44
One of the best things to do if you're on the defensive is attack something and then

1357
01:12:53.44 --> 01:12:59.56
all of a sudden you can turn the tables really really quick if you're lucky.

1358
01:12:59.56 --> 01:13:03.16
Concentration of superior forces both on the ground and in the air at the decisive place

1359
01:13:03.16 --> 01:13:10.36
in time and their employment in a decisive direction creates conditions essential to victory.

1360
01:13:10.36 --> 01:13:13.28
So again this is prioritizing actually what are you doing?

1361
01:13:13.28 --> 01:13:14.80
You're concentrating.

1362
01:13:14.80 --> 01:13:20.000
The resources, your people, your manpower, you're concentrating everything at the right

1363
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
time.

1364
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.40
Such concentration requires strict economy and the strength of forces assigned to secondary

1365
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:27.88
missions.

1366
01:13:27.88 --> 01:13:28.88
What does that mean?

1367
01:13:28.88 --> 01:13:32.20
If you focus on other things, if you don't prioritize next to you, you're going to fall

1368
01:13:32.20 --> 01:13:33.20
apart.

1369
01:13:33.20 --> 01:13:40.44
Detachments during combat are justifiable only when the execution of tasks assigns them

1370
01:13:40.44 --> 01:13:44.08
contributes directly to success in the main battle.

1371
01:13:44.08 --> 01:13:47.28
So I got a little note there, never split forces.

1372
01:13:47.28 --> 01:13:52.92
I loved it when tilt was on and tilt was talking about he's like yeah, so I had one group

1373
01:13:52.92 --> 01:13:56.28
in the valley and one group in the tree line or something like that and I was kind of like

1374
01:13:56.28 --> 01:14:01.68
I was all bummed out and I was all nervous and I was all sad because I always preached

1375
01:14:01.68 --> 01:14:07.40
don't split forces and I was like man I never really liked to split forces.

1376
01:14:07.40 --> 01:14:09.40
He goes I only did it two times.

1377
01:14:09.40 --> 01:14:15.72
It's like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when you, well, there's all kinds

1378
01:14:15.72 --> 01:14:19.04
of confusion that happened there but then this isn't really talking about not splitting

1379
01:14:19.04 --> 01:14:22.96
forces about this is talking about is if you start peeling people off to do other things,

1380
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:26.16
it better really still contribute to the main effort.

1381
01:14:26.16 --> 01:14:28.52
Yep.

1382
01:14:28.52 --> 01:14:34.60
Surprise must be sought throughout the action by every means and by every echelonic command.

1383
01:14:34.60 --> 01:14:38.44
It may be obtained by fire as well as by movement.

1384
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:42.36
Otherwise it's produced through measures which either deny information to the enemy or

1385
01:14:42.36 --> 01:14:47.84
positively deceive him as to our dispositions of movements and plants terrain which appears

1386
01:14:47.84 --> 01:14:52.84
to impose great difficulties on operations may often be utilized against surprise.

1387
01:14:52.84 --> 01:14:56.92
Surprise is furthered by variation in the means and methods employed in combat and by

1388
01:14:56.92 --> 01:14:59.88
rapidity of execution.

1389
01:14:59.88 --> 01:15:07.000
When Brian Stan was on he was like he loved to talk about that operational tempo and that's

1390
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.80
what this is talking about in that last sentence.

1391
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:11.08
How quickly can you execute?

1392
01:15:11.08 --> 01:15:16.96
If you can turn quickly and you can get back out there that's going to surprise the enemy.

1393
01:15:16.96 --> 01:15:22.72
Going into Ramadi in boats that was a terrain that the enemy didn't expect the boys

1394
01:15:22.72 --> 01:15:25.12
to come in like that's what's going to happen.

1395
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:28.92
There was other times where guys went on long patrols.

1396
01:15:28.92 --> 01:15:32.56
The enemy didn't think we're going to be out there.

1397
01:15:32.56 --> 01:15:37.08
Surprise finds the enemy in a state of mental, moral or physical unpreparedness.

1398
01:15:37.08 --> 01:15:41.56
Every effort should be made to deny him to take effective countermeasures.

1399
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:48.72
The effect of surprise may be lost through solitary methods of execution.

1400
01:15:48.72 --> 01:15:54.000
To guard against surprise requires a correct estimate of enemy capabilities, adequate security

1401
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.24
measures effective reconnaissance and readiness for action of all units.

1402
01:15:58.24 --> 01:16:02.80
Every unit takes the necessary measures for its own local ground and air security, provision

1403
01:16:02.80 --> 01:16:10.56
for the security of flanks and rear is of special importance.

1404
01:16:10.56 --> 01:16:16.20
It also requires humility to recognize that you don't necessarily know exactly what your

1405
01:16:16.20 --> 01:16:20.36
enemy is going to do and might want to think that they are more capable than you think

1406
01:16:20.36 --> 01:16:22.88
they might be and you have to have the noted recognize.

1407
01:16:22.88 --> 01:16:28.40
They might do something that we might anticipate and a humble leader doesn't get complacent

1408
01:16:28.40 --> 01:16:30.40
what the enemy can and will do.

1409
01:16:30.40 --> 01:16:31.40
They'll never do that.

1410
01:16:31.40 --> 01:16:32.40
They'll never do that.

1411
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:33.40
They'll never do that.

1412
01:16:33.40 --> 01:16:36.24
That's exactly what they're going to do if you're not.

1413
01:16:36.24 --> 01:16:37.24
Absolutely.

1414
01:16:37.24 --> 01:16:38.64
Command is the authority.

1415
01:16:38.64 --> 01:16:39.64
This section is called Command.

1416
01:16:39.64 --> 01:16:43.92
Command is the authority which an individual in the military service lawfully exercises

1417
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:49.32
over-sabordinates by virtue of rank or assignment.

1418
01:16:49.32 --> 01:16:50.92
That's what Command is.

1419
01:16:50.92 --> 01:16:59.20
By I lawfully outrank you and therefore you have to obey me.

1420
01:16:59.20 --> 01:17:03.80
That is, as this, Command and leadership are inseparable.

1421
01:17:03.80 --> 01:17:08.68
Whether the forces larger small, whether the functions of Command are complex or simple,

1422
01:17:08.68 --> 01:17:11.68
the Commander must be the controlling head.

1423
01:17:11.68 --> 01:17:17.92
His must be the mastermind and from him must flow the energy and impulse which are to

1424
01:17:17.92 --> 01:17:22.16
animate all under him.

1425
01:17:22.16 --> 01:17:28.32
So that's a little bit interesting.

1426
01:17:28.32 --> 01:17:31.76
Then we get into this.

1427
01:17:31.76 --> 01:17:39.80
That's when I was talking earlier about how there's always that difference between people

1428
01:17:39.80 --> 01:17:45.12
that think, hey, good leadership means these people will just listen to me because I have

1429
01:17:45.12 --> 01:17:47.48
authority over them.

1430
01:17:47.48 --> 01:17:52.80
And there's people that realize the truth which is that's not the way you want to lead at

1431
01:17:52.80 --> 01:17:58.72
all, which we will get into here.

1432
01:17:58.72 --> 01:18:03.20
Decision as to specific course of action is responsibility of the Commander alone.

1433
01:18:03.20 --> 01:18:07.20
While he may accept advice and suggestions from any of his subordinates, he alone is responsible

1434
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:08.96
for what the unit does or fails to do.

1435
01:18:08.96 --> 01:18:15.72
And I think that was really the crux of what that last statement was trying to say is like,

1436
01:18:15.72 --> 01:18:21.64
listen, you're going to have a platoon chief, a platoon sergeant, whatever, a company first

1437
01:18:21.64 --> 01:18:28.36
sergeant, a chief operating officer or chief operations officer that's going to give you

1438
01:18:28.36 --> 01:18:29.36
advice.

1439
01:18:29.36 --> 01:18:34.44
It's going to help you make decisions, but if you're the boss, it's on you.

1440
01:18:34.44 --> 01:18:39.52
And at the end, the idea that the leader, the Commander is responsible for the outcome

1441
01:18:39.52 --> 01:18:41.80
no matter what, I think what they're getting at.

1442
01:18:41.80 --> 01:18:46.36
I mean, I hear that in their words that I don't like the exact other way that they say it,

1443
01:18:46.36 --> 01:18:49.08
but I'm glad that they're making that clear distinction that Commander leadership are

1444
01:18:49.08 --> 01:18:50.08
two different things.

1445
01:18:50.08 --> 01:18:51.08
Commander's the structure.

1446
01:18:51.08 --> 01:18:56.12
And we all understand that military, I know who my boss is, the org-chargenetic company defines

1447
01:18:56.12 --> 01:19:02.76
the CEO, the CEO, the frontline supervisor, but the leadership component, a good commander,

1448
01:19:02.76 --> 01:19:07.000
not only am I going to take advice from other people, there are times that I simply won't

1449
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.40
be where they are.

1450
01:19:08.40 --> 01:19:13.60
And I need them to make those decisions and lead their team to end up being wrong, it's

1451
01:19:13.60 --> 01:19:16.16
still my responsibility.

1452
01:19:16.16 --> 01:19:18.36
And that piece of it, I think, is 100% sure.

1453
01:19:18.36 --> 01:19:19.36
Yeah.

1454
01:19:19.36 --> 01:19:24.64
Yeah, it's, we'll dig into it a little bit more here in a second.

1455
01:19:24.64 --> 01:19:31.68
This continues on, which is this is getting into exactly what you were just saying, a willingness

1456
01:19:31.68 --> 01:19:36.48
to accept responsibility is the foremost trait of leadership.

1457
01:19:36.48 --> 01:19:41.12
So we wrote an entire book about that called Extreme Ownership.

1458
01:19:41.12 --> 01:19:46.000
And willingness to accept responsibility is the foremost trait of leadership.

1459
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.48
Every individual from the highest commander to the lowest private must always remember that

1460
01:19:50.48 --> 01:19:57.16
inaction and neglect of opportunities will warrant even more severe censure than an error

1461
01:19:57.16 --> 01:19:59.84
of judgment in the action taken.

1462
01:19:59.84 --> 01:20:05.80
So this is something that, through inferior, definitely, hit on almost word for word.

1463
01:20:05.80 --> 01:20:13.40
That's worse to not do anything than it is to make a call and try and execute.

1464
01:20:13.40 --> 01:20:15.04
And you have bad judgment.

1465
01:20:15.04 --> 01:20:21.32
So those are bold statements.

1466
01:20:21.32 --> 01:20:25.28
Continue on the criterion by which a commander judges the soundness of his own decision

1467
01:20:25.28 --> 01:20:28.56
is whether it will further the intentions of the higher commander.

1468
01:20:28.56 --> 01:20:29.56
So there you go.

1469
01:20:29.56 --> 01:20:31.60
That makes it really easy to make decisions out of the battlefield.

1470
01:20:31.60 --> 01:20:36.24
If you come back to me and say, hey, jockel, this is what I did.

1471
01:20:36.24 --> 01:20:41.44
I know that we were trying to push west and I had an opportunity to get on this null.

1472
01:20:41.44 --> 01:20:46.72
I know it was outside our limit of advance, but it gave me a really good feel the fire over

1473
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:47.72
the west.

1474
01:20:47.72 --> 01:20:51.20
That's why I went there and I'm like, you know what?

1475
01:20:51.20 --> 01:20:55.92
Ended up not working out the way we wanted it to, but I'm glad that you did it.

1476
01:20:55.92 --> 01:20:56.92
Okay?

1477
01:20:56.92 --> 01:20:57.92
Because at least you went for it.

1478
01:20:57.92 --> 01:21:02.04
As opposed to, well, you know, I know we were going west, but I decided, you know, maybe

1479
01:21:02.04 --> 01:21:03.84
it would be smarter for us to go east.

1480
01:21:03.84 --> 01:21:05.84
And that's why I backed my force off, right?

1481
01:21:05.84 --> 01:21:11.04
You can't just ignore the overall commander.

1482
01:21:11.04 --> 01:21:13.48
The overall commander in the higher position.

1483
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:15.96
You've got to support his intentions.

1484
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:18.68
So as long and what that means is for the higher commander, you've got to make sure that

1485
01:21:18.68 --> 01:21:19.68
your intentions are known.

1486
01:21:19.68 --> 01:21:20.68
That's why we have commanders intent.

1487
01:21:20.68 --> 01:21:23.68
Totally.

1488
01:21:23.68 --> 01:21:29.16
As to accept responsibility must not manifest itself in a disregard of orders on the basis

1489
01:21:29.16 --> 01:21:34.52
of a mere probability of having better knowledge of the situation in the higher commander.

1490
01:21:34.52 --> 01:21:39.56
The subordinate unit is a part of a tactical team employed by the higher commander to accomplish

1491
01:21:39.56 --> 01:21:44.08
a certain mission and any independence on the part of the subordinate commander must conform

1492
01:21:44.08 --> 01:21:46.48
to the general plan for the unit as a whole.

1493
01:21:46.48 --> 01:21:48.88
So that's why we have parameters.

1494
01:21:48.88 --> 01:21:50.24
That's what decentralized command.

1495
01:21:50.24 --> 01:21:53.32
That's why when I'm always going off about, hey, for decentralized command to work, you

1496
01:21:53.32 --> 01:21:55.96
have to make sure everyone understands what the mission is, what the goal is, what the

1497
01:21:55.96 --> 01:21:58.92
end state is, what the parameters are that people allow to work with it.

1498
01:21:58.92 --> 01:21:59.92
That's what you need to do.

1499
01:21:59.92 --> 01:22:04.28
And that's what they're talking about here.

1500
01:22:04.28 --> 01:22:07.68
Continuing, the commander's mission is contained in the orders which he has received.

1501
01:22:07.68 --> 01:22:13.44
Nevertheless, a commander of a subordinate unit cannot plead absence of orders or the non-receive

1502
01:22:13.44 --> 01:22:18.76
orders as an excuse for inactivity in a situation where action is where action on part

1503
01:22:18.76 --> 01:22:20.72
on his part is essential.

1504
01:22:20.72 --> 01:22:25.04
Or where a change in the situation upon which the issued orders were based, renders such

1505
01:22:25.04 --> 01:22:28.92
orders impractical or impossible of execution.

1506
01:22:28.92 --> 01:22:33.52
So lack of orders lead in absence of orders lead.

1507
01:22:33.52 --> 01:22:38.12
I didn't know, nobody told me what to do.

1508
01:22:38.12 --> 01:22:43.08
And that same responsibility for the leader of recognizing that he has to train his people

1509
01:22:43.08 --> 01:22:48.96
to be able to lead in the absence of orders is 100% going to happen all the time in those

1510
01:22:48.96 --> 01:22:49.96
situations.

1511
01:22:49.96 --> 01:22:53.88
And this is so scary, especially from a military perspective.

1512
01:22:53.88 --> 01:23:01.000
It's really scary because if this sounds like could easily just just devolve into total

1513
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
mayhem, right?

1514
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.32
Hey, look, just because you don't have orders doesn't mean you should sit around and

1515
01:23:05.32 --> 01:23:06.64
do nothing.

1516
01:23:06.64 --> 01:23:10.64
And people, there's some people who think, well, I don't want my damn for some, you

1517
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:14.20
know, corporal, fire team leader out there, making calls.

1518
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:15.92
Yes, you do.

1519
01:23:15.92 --> 01:23:16.92
You have to.

1520
01:23:16.92 --> 01:23:21.56
As long as he understands from you what the intent is, then he's cleared hot.

1521
01:23:21.56 --> 01:23:22.56
Yeah.

1522
01:23:22.56 --> 01:23:24.84
And you'll figure out the right thing to do.

1523
01:23:24.84 --> 01:23:27.08
I had 13 guys in my Anglical team in her body.

1524
01:23:27.08 --> 01:23:28.08
13.

1525
01:23:28.08 --> 01:23:30.24
And I always think, man, this is 13 guys.

1526
01:23:30.24 --> 01:23:31.24
This is a small group.

1527
01:23:31.24 --> 01:23:32.92
This is easy.

1528
01:23:32.92 --> 01:23:37.28
And when I got there immediately, immediately, I think the second day I'm there and like,

1529
01:23:37.28 --> 01:23:38.68
man, I got to split these teams up.

1530
01:23:38.68 --> 01:23:40.32
There's just too many missions, too much to do.

1531
01:23:40.32 --> 01:23:41.76
I simply can't do this.

1532
01:23:41.76 --> 01:23:44.40
So 13 people I got to do four here or four here.

1533
01:23:44.40 --> 01:23:50.72
And I split them up, nine, maybe 10 of the 13 guys were on their very first deployment.

1534
01:23:50.72 --> 01:23:52.04
And look, I'll be honest with you.

1535
01:23:52.04 --> 01:23:56.16
The first time I watched another gun truck go off the base without me and like, man, I

1536
01:23:56.16 --> 01:23:57.16
don't like this.

1537
01:23:57.16 --> 01:24:00.36
I didn't like that.

1538
01:24:00.36 --> 01:24:02.52
But not only was it necessary.

1539
01:24:02.52 --> 01:24:06.20
Obviously, he was completely necessary because the the optempo in her body was just

1540
01:24:06.20 --> 01:24:07.20
completely out of control.

1541
01:24:07.20 --> 01:24:10.56
I could have used 30 more people if I had him.

1542
01:24:10.56 --> 01:24:15.56
But the reality is is that if you train them and they actually understand what they're

1543
01:24:15.56 --> 01:24:20.16
there to get accomplished, they can go lead without you being there and you need them to.

1544
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:21.60
And they have to go do it.

1545
01:24:21.60 --> 01:24:25.20
And yeah, as a leader, it's it is a little hard to let them go decentralized command.

1546
01:24:25.20 --> 01:24:28.40
The ultimate culmination of these laws, which is what you want.

1547
01:24:28.40 --> 01:24:31.08
It is a little scary and it's a little hard.

1548
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:33.76
But you can't, there's no other alternative.

1549
01:24:33.76 --> 01:24:38.52
What it should, what that fear should do, that fear should compel you to make sure that

1550
01:24:38.52 --> 01:24:42.000
everyone understands what the commanders intend is, make sure to understand what the parameters

1551
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
are.

1552
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Yes.

1553
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Make sure they understand the rules of engagement.

1554
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.04
Make sure they understand everything that's in your head.

1555
01:24:47.04 --> 01:24:49.64
That's what it should compel you to do because it is scary.

1556
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:50.64
Yeah.

1557
01:24:50.64 --> 01:24:53.24
And that you've done all the other things required to get to that.

1558
01:24:53.24 --> 01:24:55.84
I have incredibly strong relationships.

1559
01:24:55.84 --> 01:24:59.88
They understand every single thing I need them to understand.

1560
01:24:59.88 --> 01:25:03.52
And they know that we have to make hard decisions on the battlefield and prioritize.

1561
01:25:03.52 --> 01:25:06.72
They're going to do the ones that greatly, the most impact on the emission of the

1562
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:10.28
General College, I actually have to follow the laws of combat if I want to get the decentralized

1563
01:25:10.28 --> 01:25:11.28
command.

1564
01:25:11.28 --> 01:25:12.28
Sure.

1565
01:25:12.28 --> 01:25:16.88
Continuing on, if the situation does not permit communication with the superior commander

1566
01:25:16.88 --> 01:25:20.80
and the subordinate commander is familiar with the general plan of operations or the mission

1567
01:25:20.80 --> 01:25:24.76
of the whole command, he should take appropriate action and report situation as early as

1568
01:25:24.76 --> 01:25:26.40
practical.

1569
01:25:26.40 --> 01:25:29.28
Which is what exactly what your guys did and what you did with them.

1570
01:25:29.28 --> 01:25:34.64
The situations that confront a commander and war are of infinite variety.

1571
01:25:34.64 --> 01:25:38.56
And despite of the most careful planning and anticipation, unexpected obstacles, frictions

1572
01:25:38.56 --> 01:25:42.20
and mistakes are common occurrences in battle.

1573
01:25:42.20 --> 01:25:44.36
So that's right, things are going to go wrong.

1574
01:25:44.36 --> 01:25:49.76
A commander must school himself to regard these events as commonplace and not permit them

1575
01:25:49.76 --> 01:25:52.96
to frustrate him in the accomplishment of the mission.

1576
01:25:52.96 --> 01:25:53.96
Yeah.

1577
01:25:53.96 --> 01:25:55.56
What spins me up?

1578
01:25:55.56 --> 01:25:56.56
Nothing.

1579
01:25:56.56 --> 01:25:57.56
Nothing.

1580
01:25:57.56 --> 01:25:58.96
Everyone's going to screw up.

1581
01:25:58.96 --> 01:25:59.96
I'm going to screw up.

1582
01:25:59.96 --> 01:26:00.96
You're going to screw up.

1583
01:26:00.96 --> 01:26:01.96
The team leaders are going to screw up.

1584
01:26:01.96 --> 01:26:02.96
The two and start.

1585
01:26:02.96 --> 01:26:03.96
It's going to screw up.

1586
01:26:03.96 --> 01:26:04.96
That's what's going to happen.

1587
01:26:04.96 --> 01:26:06.72
I know he's going to do unexpected things.

1588
01:26:06.72 --> 01:26:08.60
That's what's going to happen.

1589
01:26:08.60 --> 01:26:10.76
Guess what's going to happen in your life?

1590
01:26:10.76 --> 01:26:12.96
Things are going to go wrong.

1591
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:15.32
The deal is not going to get closed.

1592
01:26:15.32 --> 01:26:17.08
The kids are going to get sick.

1593
01:26:17.08 --> 01:26:18.52
The cars are going to crap.

1594
01:26:18.52 --> 01:26:19.92
These things are going to happen.

1595
01:26:19.92 --> 01:26:21.72
They're going to happen.

1596
01:26:21.72 --> 01:26:23.36
It's the way life is.

1597
01:26:23.36 --> 01:26:25.72
No one's rolling through life.

1598
01:26:25.72 --> 01:26:27.40
Not hitting speed bumps.

1599
01:26:27.40 --> 01:26:28.96
It's not happening.

1600
01:26:28.96 --> 01:26:33.80
Don't let them throw you off.

1601
01:26:33.80 --> 01:26:36.32
Now here we go.

1602
01:26:36.32 --> 01:26:41.28
Personal conferences between the higher commander and his subordinates who are to execute

1603
01:26:41.28 --> 01:26:47.92
his orders may at times be advisable that the latter may arrive at a correct understanding

1604
01:26:47.92 --> 01:26:52.52
of the plans and intentions of their superior.

1605
01:26:52.52 --> 01:26:55.28
They continue his own.

1606
01:26:55.28 --> 01:26:58.44
Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates.

1607
01:26:58.44 --> 01:27:04.56
Where do they seek the approve love subordinates for their actions?

1608
01:27:04.56 --> 01:27:09.48
Now when I read that, like the other one that we were both kind of like, yes, I'm not

1609
01:27:09.48 --> 01:27:10.48
sure.

1610
01:27:10.48 --> 01:27:13.000
When I read that right there, I was like, here's my notes.

1611
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You see what they say?

1612
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000
It says wrong.

1613
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
That's wrong.

1614
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.000
That's just wrong.

1615
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I'll read it again.

1616
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So we know what's wrong.

1617
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It starts off with something cool.

1618
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.16
Hey, personal conferences between the higher commander and his subordinates who are to execute

1619
01:27:24.16 --> 01:27:27.68
his orders may at times be advisable.

1620
01:27:27.68 --> 01:27:31.36
You go on a meet with your people so that the latter may arrive at the correct understanding

1621
01:27:31.36 --> 01:27:32.92
of the plans and intentions of their superior.

1622
01:27:32.92 --> 01:27:35.12
Yes, meet with your people to almost going on.

1623
01:27:35.12 --> 01:27:40.64
But then it says this, I kind of have to change voices for this one a little bit.

1624
01:27:40.64 --> 01:27:44.000
Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates.

1625
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.76
No, do they seek the approval of their subordinates for their actions?

1626
01:27:48.76 --> 01:27:51.56
So I highlighted that circle and I wrote wrong.

1627
01:27:51.56 --> 01:27:53.84
I was really pissed when I read it.

1628
01:27:53.84 --> 01:27:56.32
And I was like, you know what?

1629
01:27:56.32 --> 01:27:58.92
Let's see if anything changed.

1630
01:27:58.92 --> 01:28:10.40
So I went to the 1944 manual and in 1944, that there are very limited changes in this

1631
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:11.40
section.

1632
01:28:11.40 --> 01:28:20.44
In fact, mostly what is different between 1944 and 1941 is they have a massive sections

1633
01:28:20.44 --> 01:28:22.24
on air power on how it's going to be used.

1634
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:27.76
So I started all that stuff in the 1944 version.

1635
01:28:27.76 --> 01:28:30.88
They completely eliminate that sentence.

1636
01:28:30.88 --> 01:28:33.52
Yeah, good.

1637
01:28:33.52 --> 01:28:36.60
They completely eliminate that sentence because guess what?

1638
01:28:36.60 --> 01:28:42.20
As a commander, you are absolutely trying to explain your decisions to your subordinates.

1639
01:28:42.20 --> 01:28:46.08
You want them to understand why you're making a decision.

1640
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:50.68
You want them to never mind to prove you want them to actually just totally embrace

1641
01:28:50.68 --> 01:28:54.36
and love and probably hopefully even come up with that decision themselves.

1642
01:28:54.36 --> 01:28:59.000
There's probably some element in there of this idea of decisiveness.

1643
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.24
And the language is probably trying to get to something that they were thinking about

1644
01:29:03.24 --> 01:29:06.04
that was clearly not explained correctly.

1645
01:29:06.04 --> 01:29:12.32
But this idea that you don't owe your people and explanation is crazy.

1646
01:29:12.32 --> 01:29:13.32
It's crazy.

1647
01:29:13.32 --> 01:29:19.000
And as a matter of fact, if you can't explain it in a way that's really compelling and

1648
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.92
they have them go, oh boss, got it.

1649
01:29:20.92 --> 01:29:22.08
I'm on board.

1650
01:29:22.08 --> 01:29:23.08
You're doing it wrong.

1651
01:29:23.08 --> 01:29:24.48
You actually don't understand it well enough.

1652
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:27.32
And if you have to leverage the, oh you don't understand what I'm saying.

1653
01:29:27.32 --> 01:29:30.32
Okay, just do your job because I'm in charge of you.

1654
01:29:30.32 --> 01:29:31.96
It's just wrong.

1655
01:29:31.96 --> 01:29:32.96
Yeah, period.

1656
01:29:32.96 --> 01:29:35.92
And it's like this stood out for me.

1657
01:29:35.92 --> 01:29:38.20
This is not in the German manual at all.

1658
01:29:38.20 --> 01:29:39.20
It's not in there.

1659
01:29:39.20 --> 01:29:41.48
There's nothing that says anything close to that in German manual.

1660
01:29:41.48 --> 01:29:46.60
So what that told me is, that's why I started thinking about this pull between people

1661
01:29:46.60 --> 01:29:49.96
that leaders that are like, hey listen, bottom line, there's people got a dude to tell

1662
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:50.96
me dude.

1663
01:29:50.96 --> 01:29:52.92
That's what there was a guy in the room.

1664
01:29:52.92 --> 01:29:54.44
I wonder if there's that guy there.

1665
01:29:54.44 --> 01:29:58.92
So hey, this is 41 now, I think, you know, little piece of, you know, hey, there's

1666
01:29:58.92 --> 01:30:03.12
this piece of this, this time that they didn't really quite get it.

1667
01:30:03.12 --> 01:30:07.12
The 44 guys are thinking, well, what have we been doing for the last three years?

1668
01:30:07.12 --> 01:30:08.60
Get rid of that because that's crap.

1669
01:30:08.60 --> 01:30:09.60
It doesn't work.

1670
01:30:09.60 --> 01:30:10.60
Exactly.

1671
01:30:10.60 --> 01:30:18.44
This room in this room, there was some pug, some rear echelon dude that was sitting

1672
01:30:18.44 --> 01:30:21.76
there going, hey, you know, the bottom line though, I understand that we want, you know,

1673
01:30:21.76 --> 01:30:22.76
people got to understand.

1674
01:30:22.76 --> 01:30:26.64
But the bottom line is you don't have to go and justify your decisions to your subordinates.

1675
01:30:26.64 --> 01:30:28.72
You know, that you don't need to seek approval.

1676
01:30:28.72 --> 01:30:29.72
Yeah.

1677
01:30:29.72 --> 01:30:31.88
You tell them what to do and they go and damn do it.

1678
01:30:31.88 --> 01:30:34.32
That's the way it's got to be in the end, you're in charge.

1679
01:30:34.32 --> 01:30:36.80
So if they can't, you know, go back and forth for a while, but sooner than you got

1680
01:30:36.80 --> 01:30:39.000
to put your foot down and let them do those in charge.

1681
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.20
You got to just got to let them have it.

1682
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:47.76
And like you said, you can you imagine they reconvene after three years of war.

1683
01:30:47.76 --> 01:30:50.04
And they say, you know what?

1684
01:30:50.04 --> 01:30:52.84
Who wrote, who's the pug that wrote that?

1685
01:30:52.84 --> 01:30:54.88
We're not going to rewrite it or change it.

1686
01:30:54.88 --> 01:30:55.88
You can't just rid of it.

1687
01:30:55.88 --> 01:30:58.28
And that sentence.

1688
01:30:58.28 --> 01:31:01.16
I wasn't sure if I wanted to, we were actually going to cover this manual, but when I

1689
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:05.24
got to that, I was like, oh, this is all, this makes it all worthwhile.

1690
01:31:05.24 --> 01:31:06.64
This makes it all worthwhile.

1691
01:31:06.64 --> 01:31:13.36
Because you understand that after three years of war, this should be a notification to

1692
01:31:13.36 --> 01:31:20.80
leaders around the world that if you think that you can just order people and that's going

1693
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:24.64
to work out for you, you're wrong, you're wrong.

1694
01:31:24.64 --> 01:31:28.12
And you know, you, the way you worded something, I got to jump back to it.

1695
01:31:28.12 --> 01:31:33.24
Because you said, you said, if you, something like if you can't explain to your people

1696
01:31:33.24 --> 01:31:36.88
while you're doing something, then you're doing it wrong.

1697
01:31:36.88 --> 01:31:40.88
I want to make it clear that when you say you're doing it wrong, you're talking about

1698
01:31:40.88 --> 01:31:43.56
what you're telling them to do is wrong.

1699
01:31:43.56 --> 01:31:47.92
Because if I say, hey, Dave, we want to assault this target from the West.

1700
01:31:47.92 --> 01:31:50.36
And you're like, why?

1701
01:31:50.36 --> 01:31:53.60
And I say, well, because that's the best spot.

1702
01:31:53.60 --> 01:31:55.24
And you go, well, there's a channelized area.

1703
01:31:55.24 --> 01:31:55.92
You're going to have to go through.

1704
01:31:55.92 --> 01:31:58.24
And I say, no, we're going to go from the West.

1705
01:31:58.24 --> 01:32:02.76
And you say, but there's an open area here from the South, where we can get cover on this

1706
01:32:02.76 --> 01:32:08.64
to high ground, it will be, and I say, no, we're going from the West.

1707
01:32:08.64 --> 01:32:13.64
And my only recourse is to say, no, Dave, I'm the boss.

1708
01:32:13.64 --> 01:32:15.64
You're going from the West.

1709
01:32:15.64 --> 01:32:17.44
You're doing it wrong.

1710
01:32:17.44 --> 01:32:18.44
Yeah.

1711
01:32:18.44 --> 01:32:19.44
Not just my leadership.

1712
01:32:19.44 --> 01:32:22.48
You're doing the thing that you're trying to get done is wrong.

1713
01:32:22.48 --> 01:32:23.48
Yeah.

1714
01:32:23.48 --> 01:32:26.64
So worthwhile.

1715
01:32:26.64 --> 01:32:28.64
Continues on.

1716
01:32:28.64 --> 01:32:31.64
And you got to look at the 44.

1717
01:32:31.64 --> 01:32:35.36
Like, it's almost like, here's the next one after this.

1718
01:32:35.36 --> 01:32:39.76
In 1941, it was all troops assigned to the execution of a distinct mission should be placed

1719
01:32:39.76 --> 01:32:41.36
under one command.

1720
01:32:41.36 --> 01:32:44.84
The next, the very next line, after they eliminate that all troops assigned to the execution

1721
01:32:44.84 --> 01:32:46.48
it's literally the same.

1722
01:32:46.48 --> 01:32:49.76
They went through this thing and was like, hey, this is a pretty solid get rid of that

1723
01:32:49.76 --> 01:32:50.76
line.

1724
01:32:50.76 --> 01:32:53.76
Who, what turg, wrote that?

1725
01:32:53.76 --> 01:32:55.20
So check.

1726
01:32:55.20 --> 01:32:58.68
All troops assigned to the execution of a distinct mission should be placed under one command

1727
01:32:58.68 --> 01:33:02.92
to function as a task force for the duration of the operation.

1728
01:33:02.92 --> 01:33:06.76
So long as a commander can exercise effective command, he does not disturb the established

1729
01:33:06.76 --> 01:33:09.64
chain of command in his force.

1730
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:12.80
In some situations, condition dictate that attachments belongs to be made to support

1731
01:33:12.80 --> 01:33:13.80
in the commands.

1732
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:21.96
So this is something that, it's a little bit of this sometimes, like a group, a task unit,

1733
01:33:21.96 --> 01:33:25.32
a battalion, a company gets assigned.

1734
01:33:25.32 --> 01:33:30.36
And if the leader, if the overall leader doesn't have the wherewithal to say, okay, you

1735
01:33:30.36 --> 01:33:32.000
know what?

1736
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.68
Task unit bruiser, you're supporting and task unit alpha, you're, you guys are running

1737
01:33:35.68 --> 01:33:36.68
this.

1738
01:33:36.68 --> 01:33:38.48
And the task unit bruiser guy, the task unit bruiser guy, the task unit bruiser guy,

1739
01:33:38.48 --> 01:33:41.48
said, cool, hey, alpha, what do you need?

1740
01:33:41.48 --> 01:33:44.84
So often it's like, man, I should have been the one maintenance.

1741
01:33:44.84 --> 01:33:46.68
That should be me.

1742
01:33:46.68 --> 01:33:51.08
And I remember a couple times early in task unit bruiser while I was trying to be trying

1743
01:33:51.08 --> 01:33:54.08
to hang out with a fair fairy and be like, well, you know, we fake it.

1744
01:33:54.08 --> 01:33:57.84
It's like, no, life you're running this one, Seth, your support, or Seth, you're running

1745
01:33:57.84 --> 01:33:58.84
this one.

1746
01:33:58.84 --> 01:33:59.84
That's the way it is.

1747
01:33:59.84 --> 01:34:03.36
I think I tried that one time, like, oh, you guys can each be over here.

1748
01:34:03.36 --> 01:34:04.56
No, stupid.

1749
01:34:08.16 --> 01:34:10.76
And if your guys actually believe in the mission, it's no fact.

1750
01:34:10.76 --> 01:34:12.36
It's never, they don't care at all.

1751
01:34:12.36 --> 01:34:13.44
Roger that boss, I'm on it.

1752
01:34:13.44 --> 01:34:14.28
Yeah.

1753
01:34:14.28 --> 01:34:15.28
What do you need, man?

1754
01:34:15.28 --> 01:34:16.28
Get it?

1755
01:34:16.28 --> 01:34:18.84
The big picture if you'd explain the mission and they buy into it, you could put

1756
01:34:18.84 --> 01:34:21.12
that guy as a support element forever.

1757
01:34:21.12 --> 01:34:22.12
Yep.

1758
01:34:22.12 --> 01:34:22.72
And he's like, no factor.

1759
01:34:22.72 --> 01:34:23.88
No matter what you need.

1760
01:34:23.88 --> 01:34:25.24
I will support all day long.

1761
01:34:25.24 --> 01:34:26.24
What do you need?

1762
01:34:26.24 --> 01:34:29.20
Not to mention half the time you go out there and the situation completely changes

1763
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:31.04
and the supporting effort becomes the main effort.

1764
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:32.04
Of course.

1765
01:34:32.04 --> 01:34:33.32
Of course.

1766
01:34:33.32 --> 01:34:39.76
Isn't it crazy though if you're working for me and I go, hey, Dave, you're supporting

1767
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:41.60
effort and you're like awesome.

1768
01:34:41.60 --> 01:34:42.60
Got it.

1769
01:34:42.60 --> 01:34:46.52
And then the next night, I'm like, hey, Dave, you're supporting effort and you say,

1770
01:34:46.52 --> 01:34:47.52
awesome, got it.

1771
01:34:47.52 --> 01:34:48.52
And then I say, hey, you know what?

1772
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:49.80
You're going to be supporting effort again.

1773
01:34:49.80 --> 01:34:50.80
You're like, bring it.

1774
01:34:50.80 --> 01:34:51.80
Yeah.

1775
01:34:51.80 --> 01:34:52.80
I'm ready.

1776
01:34:52.80 --> 01:34:53.80
We're getting this dialed.

1777
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:56.36
Hey, man, I need you to do supporting effort again.

1778
01:34:56.36 --> 01:34:59.80
And you say, Roger that, we're already.

1779
01:34:59.80 --> 01:35:02.12
So if that's your attitude, that's awesome.

1780
01:35:02.12 --> 01:35:03.52
And eventually I go, hey, you know what, Dave?

1781
01:35:03.52 --> 01:35:04.52
You're running this then.

1782
01:35:04.52 --> 01:35:05.84
Guess it's going to be the main effort.

1783
01:35:05.84 --> 01:35:08.80
Now, if I go, hey, Dave, you're the supporting effort.

1784
01:35:08.80 --> 01:35:09.96
You go, okay.

1785
01:35:09.96 --> 01:35:11.44
Okay.

1786
01:35:11.44 --> 01:35:13.52
And then the next night I go, hey, you're supporting effort again.

1787
01:35:13.52 --> 01:35:14.52
Why?

1788
01:35:14.52 --> 01:35:16.28
I was supporting effort last night.

1789
01:35:16.28 --> 01:35:18.12
I immediately hate you.

1790
01:35:18.12 --> 01:35:19.12
Yes.

1791
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:20.12
Yeah.

1792
01:35:20.12 --> 01:35:23.76
I immediately go, bro, is your ego really that out of control that on this

1793
01:35:23.76 --> 01:35:27.20
random piece of paper, somewhere on this particular operation.

1794
01:35:27.20 --> 01:35:29.56
On an operation that we have no idea where it's going to go or what's

1795
01:35:29.56 --> 01:35:30.56
going to happen.

1796
01:35:30.56 --> 01:35:33.52
You could end up being the element that's in the big giant fire fight that

1797
01:35:33.52 --> 01:35:34.92
needs to step up.

1798
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:37.24
And you want your so concerned about that right now.

1799
01:35:37.24 --> 01:35:39.16
That's where your priorities are.

1800
01:35:39.16 --> 01:35:39.96
That that's where we're at.

1801
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:40.56
Okay, cool.

1802
01:35:40.56 --> 01:35:41.44
No did.

1803
01:35:41.44 --> 01:35:42.76
I will never make you.

1804
01:35:42.76 --> 01:35:44.76
I'll never put you in charge of anything ever.

1805
01:35:44.76 --> 01:35:45.76
Yeah.

1806
01:35:45.76 --> 01:35:46.28
You know what?

1807
01:35:46.28 --> 01:35:49.72
Nobody ever asked me in 23 years of conducting missions in the Marine

1808
01:35:49.72 --> 01:35:50.24
Corps.

1809
01:35:50.24 --> 01:35:52.72
Hey, were you assigned the main effort to read the support?

1810
01:35:52.72 --> 01:35:55.000
Nobody cares.

1811
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.68
And yeah, it's the blend of the ego and just, hey, what's the best way to

1812
01:35:58.68 --> 01:36:00.88
what's the thing I can do to help accomplish the mission?

1813
01:36:00.88 --> 01:36:02.32
I mean, I don't care what it is.

1814
01:36:02.32 --> 01:36:07.40
And by the way, if you and I meet and I say, hey, Dave, you know, I've been

1815
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:12.56
assigned supporter, you know, to you, which is kind of crap because I think my

1816
01:36:12.56 --> 01:36:16.28
my, my company's better than your company, but whatever, that's what the

1817
01:36:16.28 --> 01:36:17.72
boss decided.

1818
01:36:17.72 --> 01:36:21.04
So tell me what you need and I'll do it.

1819
01:36:21.04 --> 01:36:23.12
Like just think about that.

1820
01:36:23.12 --> 01:36:26.92
And now when I say, hey, Dave, you know, we shouldn't do it like that.

1821
01:36:26.92 --> 01:36:30.000
You will, you won't listen to a damn thing I say.

1822
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.72
But if I say, hey, Dave, hey, man, we're here to support.

1823
01:36:32.72 --> 01:36:37.36
And if you need anything, tell me and let's get it done.

1824
01:36:37.36 --> 01:36:40.96
And then we're now in a planning, I go, hey, what do you think about us setting up

1825
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:41.96
over here?

1826
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:44.08
You know, a little bit different than your thoughts, but what do you think of that?

1827
01:36:44.08 --> 01:36:47.28
And you go, hmm, well, that's actually not a bad idea.

1828
01:36:47.28 --> 01:36:50.36
So I have a little bit of humility and all of a sudden I can actually influence the

1829
01:36:50.36 --> 01:36:55.16
situation a thousand times more than if I go in there with my chess boat out and my

1830
01:36:55.16 --> 01:36:58.88
ego barking like a rabbit dog.

1831
01:36:58.88 --> 01:36:59.88
Yeah.

1832
01:36:59.88 --> 01:37:03.92
And the worst part about that is if you do that, your idea might actually still be better

1833
01:37:03.92 --> 01:37:04.92
than mine.

1834
01:37:04.92 --> 01:37:05.92
And I won't listen to you.

1835
01:37:05.92 --> 01:37:06.92
Of course.

1836
01:37:06.92 --> 01:37:07.92
Of course.

1837
01:37:07.92 --> 01:37:09.92
It's just a freaking disaster.

1838
01:37:09.92 --> 01:37:13.60
Just get on board for the entire team to win and it works out.

1839
01:37:13.60 --> 01:37:17.000
Get on board for the big win.

1840
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.90
Add me to the situation and need tactical operation, the commander must quickly

1841
01:37:20.90 --> 01:37:26.40
evaluate all available information bearing on his task, estimate the situation and reach

1842
01:37:26.40 --> 01:37:27.42
a decision.

1843
01:37:27.42 --> 01:37:30.18
The commander's estimate of situation is based on the mission of the unit.

1844
01:37:30.18 --> 01:37:35.12
The means available to him and to the enemy, the conditions in his area of operations including

1845
01:37:35.12 --> 01:37:41.08
the train and weather, the probable effects of various lines of action on future operations.

1846
01:37:41.08 --> 01:37:46.10
The bases of these factors, he considers the lines of action opened to him.

1847
01:37:46.10 --> 01:37:50.74
of successful will accomplish his mission and the lines of action with of which the enemy

1848
01:37:50.74 --> 01:37:56.74
is physically capable and which can interfere with such accomplishment. He analyzes the opposing

1849
01:37:56.74 --> 01:38:01.62
lines of action one against another to arrive at conclusions as to the probability of success

1850
01:38:01.62 --> 01:38:09.06
for each of his own lines of action. There's a lot of words. Check all the different courses

1851
01:38:09.06 --> 01:38:16.34
of action. See what the potential outcomes are. Move forward with one of them. On the basis of this

1852
01:38:16.34 --> 01:38:20.50
analysis, he considers the relative advantages and disadvantages of his own lines of action

1853
01:38:20.50 --> 01:38:25.14
and selects this line of action which most promises success regardless of what the enemy may do.

1854
01:38:25.14 --> 01:38:30.02
If two or more lines of action appear equally promising, he chooses the one that will most

1855
01:38:30.02 --> 01:38:36.82
favor future action. Pretty straightforward. The estimate often requires rapid thinking with consideration

1856
01:38:36.82 --> 01:38:42.34
limited to essential factors. In campaign, exact conclusions concerning the enemy can seldom be drawn.

1857
01:38:43.06 --> 01:38:48.74
To delay action and emergency because of insufficient information shows a lack of energetic

1858
01:38:48.74 --> 01:38:55.30
leadership and may result in lost opportunities. The commander must take calculated risks.

1859
01:38:57.22 --> 01:39:03.06
I read all that so I could say that last thing. Oudalu, strategic versus tactical. If you don't

1860
01:39:03.06 --> 01:39:10.26
do anything in a tactical situation, you're going to lose. Then you're not going to know everything.

1861
01:39:10.26 --> 01:39:18.02
No. Ever. Ever. You do not know the potential outcomes. Even if you have the best intelligence,

1862
01:39:18.02 --> 01:39:24.34
it's going to change. Continue on. Considering the enemy's possible lines of action, the commander must

1863
01:39:24.34 --> 01:39:30.34
guard against unwarranted belief that he has discovered the enemy's intentions and against ignoring

1864
01:39:30.34 --> 01:39:35.22
other lines of action over to the enemy. This is what you said earlier. If you think you know what

1865
01:39:35.22 --> 01:39:41.70
the enemy's going to do, you're wrong. Don't fall into that ego trap. Even when the weight of

1866
01:39:41.70 --> 01:39:45.78
evidence warrants the belief that the enemy is committed to a definite line of action,

1867
01:39:46.90 --> 01:39:51.06
the commander must bear in mind that it changes the enemy's plans may occur at any time.

1868
01:39:53.06 --> 01:39:58.18
That's the way it happens. You gotta stay humble. The estimate of the situation culminates in the decision.

1869
01:39:58.18 --> 01:40:06.58
Once a decision, a decision once made is not changed without some compelling reason. In combat,

1870
01:40:06.58 --> 01:40:11.86
the will and energy of the commander must persist until the mission is accomplished. Estimation

1871
01:40:11.86 --> 01:40:18.42
of the situation is, however, a continuous process and changed conditions may at any time

1872
01:40:18.42 --> 01:40:25.86
call for a new decision. Two stubborn adherents to a previous decision may result in costly delay,

1873
01:40:25.86 --> 01:40:31.54
loss of opportunity for decisive action or outright failure. The troop and fear and

1874
01:40:32.42 --> 01:40:37.94
covered this very, very well. Sometimes, yeah, it's this. You want to stick with your plan,

1875
01:40:38.98 --> 01:40:42.90
but you're constantly assessing to see if your plan was the right plan. If your decision was the

1876
01:40:42.90 --> 01:40:48.02
right decision and if it's not, change. That's the utilip. Impits are happening all the time.

1877
01:40:48.02 --> 01:40:51.46
As soon as I learned, hey, there's enough inputs. Tell me, I got to change. I got to do something different.

1878
01:40:51.46 --> 01:40:57.30
And you better have the ability to maneuver. When you're making those, you may that decision

1879
01:40:57.30 --> 01:41:02.34
you're taking action. You have to preserve the ability to maneuver because it's going to change

1880
01:41:02.34 --> 01:41:10.82
period. Yeah. That's that over commitment. It starts to talk about terrain here.

1881
01:41:12.18 --> 01:41:16.26
The part of the commander's estimate dealing with terrain often exercises decisive influence upon

1882
01:41:16.26 --> 01:41:20.82
a decision in plan. The proper evaluation and utilization of the terrain reduce the disadvantage of

1883
01:41:20.82 --> 01:41:27.46
incomplete information of the enemy. The more important features to be considered in evaluating terrain

1884
01:41:27.46 --> 01:41:32.42
include not only natural ground forms such as mountain ridges, streams, bodies of water woods,

1885
01:41:32.42 --> 01:41:37.14
and open spaces, but also artificial features such as roads, railroads, and towns. The commander's

1886
01:41:37.14 --> 01:41:42.90
seeks always to utilize the terrain to his own advantage and to the enemy's disadvantage. Now,

1887
01:41:42.90 --> 01:41:52.34
that's one of those things. Well, I definitely, for me, as a leader, when I, actually,

1888
01:41:52.34 --> 01:42:03.78
as a leader, but more as an instructor, the difference between someone that sucks as a small

1889
01:42:03.78 --> 01:42:09.62
element unit leader, small unit leader. Someone that doesn't do it right and someone that does it well,

1890
01:42:09.62 --> 01:42:14.98
is someone that doesn't write utilizes the terrain and someone that doesn't, they don't. Yeah.

1891
01:42:14.98 --> 01:42:21.06
So that's why I put that in there. But there's much more to it than that. And that is the fact that

1892
01:42:21.06 --> 01:42:26.34
when you are leading people, when you're interacting with human beings, there's terrain that needs

1893
01:42:26.34 --> 01:42:34.74
to be accounted for. The terrain isn't bridges, streams, and mountains. The terrain is ego.

1894
01:42:34.74 --> 01:42:44.18
It's agendas. It's personalities. It's nuances that it's idiosyncrasies that people have.

1895
01:42:44.18 --> 01:42:51.06
That's the terrain. That's so important. And it's that every single person you're

1896
01:42:51.06 --> 01:42:55.54
interacting with is going to be a little bit different. And those idiosyncrasies and all those

1897
01:42:55.54 --> 01:43:00.82
little small components, a good leader understands all of those different things. So the idea of what

1898
01:43:00.82 --> 01:43:09.54
terrain is in their mind is all of that together. Yeah. I think you were setting me up for meeting

1899
01:43:09.54 --> 01:43:14.18
and you gave me like an eight minute brief on the scenario that was happening. Like, hey,

1900
01:43:14.18 --> 01:43:18.98
this is what's going on. This is this guy. This where it comes from. This is what he likes. This is the

1901
01:43:18.98 --> 01:43:26.02
problem. He's had. Here's what I think he wants to do. And this is the approach I would take.

1902
01:43:26.02 --> 01:43:31.94
And I was like, check, what did you just brief me on? You didn't mention trails and mountains,

1903
01:43:31.94 --> 01:43:37.62
but you gave me the terrain brief that I was about to walk into. That's what it is. And then

1904
01:43:38.98 --> 01:43:45.94
then when I walk into that meeting, instead of me being a leader that doesn't know what's happening,

1905
01:43:45.94 --> 01:43:50.90
all of a sudden, I'm a leader that understands the terrain and can make the right maneuvers.

1906
01:43:50.90 --> 01:43:58.34
No, you're terrain. Think about what, and really what this boils down to you from a

1907
01:43:58.34 --> 01:44:04.02
leadership perspective in the business world is think of identify your terrain, right? Identify it.

1908
01:44:04.02 --> 01:44:08.42
Let's let's talk about what that is and see how we can use it to our advantage.

1909
01:44:10.74 --> 01:44:16.82
Next section is called conduct in battle. The commander's decision for his unit is a

1910
01:44:16.82 --> 01:44:21.86
whole and the missions to subordinate units in support of the decision are communicated to

1911
01:44:21.86 --> 01:44:27.70
subordinates by clearing concise orders, which give them freedom of action appropriate to their

1912
01:44:27.70 --> 01:44:32.50
professional knowledge, to the situation, to their dependability, and to the team play desired.

1913
01:44:33.06 --> 01:44:37.54
So again, I think there was a poge in the room. And sometimes the other guys were like,

1914
01:44:37.54 --> 01:44:42.90
hey, bro, no, freedom of action is what these guys need. And they just had to like,

1915
01:44:42.90 --> 01:44:48.50
sometimes we're add this stuff while the poge is out getting coffee. I think the poge was probably

1916
01:44:48.50 --> 01:44:54.18
the senior guy in a couple times, he just overwrote him. But they just, they just like,

1917
01:44:54.18 --> 01:44:58.74
he, they sent him to get, they went to a meeting and they did like several sections.

1918
01:44:58.74 --> 01:45:03.62
That sentence is the exact opposite of what that said. Yeah. You know, a couple pages back.

1919
01:45:03.62 --> 01:45:11.06
It's exact opposite thing. Freedom of action. Clearing concise orders, which gives them freedom of action,

1920
01:45:11.06 --> 01:45:18.82
use that as your guide. Next, after providing for the issuance of orders, the commander places

1921
01:45:18.82 --> 01:45:23.46
himself where he can best control the course of action in an exerted leadership. His command post

1922
01:45:23.46 --> 01:45:27.70
affords the advantage of established signal communication. When opportunity offers and when his

1923
01:45:27.70 --> 01:45:32.02
presence at the command post is not urgently required, he visits subordinates, commanders, and his

1924
01:45:32.02 --> 01:45:37.22
troops in order to inspire competence, and to assure himself that his orders are understood

1925
01:45:37.22 --> 01:45:41.86
and properly executed. Yep, you got it. The Navy, they started calling that deck plate leadership.

1926
01:45:41.86 --> 01:45:45.46
Do you guys ever hear that? Say, you need to get out. You need to get out with the troops.

1927
01:45:45.46 --> 01:45:50.74
You can't sit in the tariff conditioning space when you're got, you know, your, your

1928
01:45:50.74 --> 01:45:56.10
boasts made down there in the well deck. Right. And it's 180 degrees in the well deck

1929
01:45:57.06 --> 01:45:58.50
with diesel fumes. Yeah.

1930
01:46:01.86 --> 01:46:06.66
Whenever the commander leaves his command post, he should orient his staff as to further plans to be

1931
01:46:06.66 --> 01:46:11.86
made or measures to be taken in anticipation of future condensings and should inform his staff

1932
01:46:11.86 --> 01:46:17.54
where he can be reached. Yep. During the decisive phase of battle, the place of the commander is

1933
01:46:17.54 --> 01:46:24.90
near the critical point of action. Not in it, but near it, a commander influences the course of

1934
01:46:24.90 --> 01:46:28.98
subsequent action by his leadership by the use of his reserves, by the concentration of artillery

1935
01:46:28.98 --> 01:46:33.14
and other sporting fires, and by the employment of combat aviation and armored units.

1936
01:46:33.14 --> 01:46:40.98
The duration of attack cooperation can seldom be predicted. Successful engagements,

1937
01:46:40.98 --> 01:46:46.02
engagements, sometimes progress so slowly that gains made are not immediately imperant.

1938
01:46:46.66 --> 01:46:53.06
A parent, other times they progress so fast that gains made can be capitalized only by the

1939
01:46:53.06 --> 01:47:00.50
most aggressive and far-sighted leadership. Troops are used up rapidly in decisive phases of combat.

1940
01:47:00.50 --> 01:47:04.90
This attrition must be anticipated by the commander and his staff who take timely measures for

1941
01:47:04.90 --> 01:47:09.78
replacement of men, unit transport weapons, and for replenishment of ammunition and other supplies.

1942
01:47:09.78 --> 01:47:15.62
When the situation permits troops which have been heavily engaged, are rested and reorganized

1943
01:47:15.62 --> 01:47:18.10
before being assigned new and important mission.

1944
01:47:22.58 --> 01:47:27.22
The staff assists the commander to the extent that he may require by providing information data

1945
01:47:27.22 --> 01:47:31.62
and advice by preparing detailed plans in order to enhance the direction by exercising

1946
01:47:31.62 --> 01:47:37.54
such supervision over the execution of his orders as he may prescribe. A staff officer as such

1947
01:47:37.54 --> 01:47:46.90
does not exercise command. The staff may be divided into two groups. The general staff and the

1948
01:47:46.90 --> 01:47:50.58
special staff in large units, these two staff groups are separate and distinct and small units

1949
01:47:50.58 --> 01:47:55.94
that merge into each other. And one staff officer frequently is charged with the duties

1950
01:47:55.94 --> 01:48:02.18
pertaining to both staff groups. Now the whole reason that I read the last two three paragraphs

1951
01:48:03.14 --> 01:48:10.66
was so I could read this. In every headquarters there is a constant tendency to multiply

1952
01:48:10.66 --> 01:48:17.46
personnel, expand the functions of staff administration and accumulate records and office equipment.

1953
01:48:19.30 --> 01:48:24.90
And then this is one of the only thing that is italicized in this book. It says,

1954
01:48:24.90 --> 01:48:32.42
the commander must avoid this expansion. He must organize his headquarters so as to maintain

1955
01:48:32.42 --> 01:48:37.06
its readiness for improvement. So again, this is when the pope walked out of the room, they're like

1956
01:48:37.06 --> 01:48:41.78
let the pope wrote all those other three paragraphs. He was in like the staff this and the staff

1957
01:48:41.78 --> 01:48:45.46
commander and then these guys were like, listen, they're going to try and expand the staff.

1958
01:48:45.46 --> 01:48:49.22
You don't need it. I was always surprised like there's a section on the staff.

1959
01:48:49.22 --> 01:48:54.90
I was like, oh, do we need to put that? And I've been listening to even some of the other things,

1960
01:48:56.26 --> 01:49:00.90
there's something that he said earlier even about that point of friction. I think really what he was

1961
01:49:00.90 --> 01:49:04.98
saying is you'll burn through resources more quickly. Which is true. I understand that because that's

1962
01:49:04.98 --> 01:49:09.78
where the culminating event is and that means you know your people have to be cycled through more

1963
01:49:09.78 --> 01:49:13.94
quickly and you have to pull them out. There's a part of that that's true. For sure, the point of

1964
01:49:13.94 --> 01:49:17.54
friction is going to require the most resources and the most energy and you're going to exert yourself

1965
01:49:17.54 --> 01:49:21.86
the most. But there's a piece in there that probably needs to be worth expanding on a little bit

1966
01:49:21.86 --> 01:49:27.78
is that the point of friction is actually if you're prepared and brief for it, those people actually

1967
01:49:27.78 --> 01:49:32.02
have the most endurance because that's where they want to be. That's where they've been

1968
01:49:32.02 --> 01:49:37.06
anticipating. That's the entire thing this whole build has been about as to get there and they're

1969
01:49:37.06 --> 01:49:41.78
the most involved and the most engaged. Those people also have the most endurance. It's the places

1970
01:49:41.78 --> 01:49:45.54
where there's at least amount going on, the least amount of friction where you feel you're

1971
01:49:45.54 --> 01:49:51.62
making the least impact. Those are the people that are the first ones to really struggle because

1972
01:49:51.62 --> 01:49:56.74
they feel disconnected and it's not 100% wrong the way they set it. But I wanted there to be a piece

1973
01:49:56.74 --> 01:50:01.94
of saying, oh by the way, everybody wants to be at the point of friction on your team if you

1974
01:50:01.94 --> 01:50:06.50
prepared and built them and those people can actually endure the longest. You still need to pull

1975
01:50:06.50 --> 01:50:10.42
some of those folks off the line. You still need to assess how they're doing, but the people in most

1976
01:50:10.42 --> 01:50:15.30
engaged are typically the people that are most willing to stay engaged the longest and that piece

1977
01:50:15.30 --> 01:50:21.86
was missing in that last section there. And as this piece time hint to all these comments that are

1978
01:50:21.86 --> 01:50:28.74
in there and like the point of friction, you would have to choke me out to get me away from that,

1979
01:50:28.74 --> 01:50:34.50
to give me a chance to rest and to refit and again, it doesn't mean that you just let them go

1980
01:50:34.50 --> 01:50:39.78
in the red forever. But there's just a part missing in there that this guy we're talking about,

1981
01:50:39.78 --> 01:50:45.14
whoever this guy was, the poke. Yeah, the poke. The RAMF had a lot of influence on that. I'm like,

1982
01:50:45.14 --> 01:50:48.50
what about the other part that says, oh by the way, that's everybody really wants to be.

1983
01:50:48.50 --> 01:50:53.14
Yeah, because that guy doesn't want to be there. No. And he's like, all those guys need to break,

1984
01:50:53.14 --> 01:50:58.50
like, I dare you to pull me off the line when things are at their most intense. Good luck

1985
01:50:58.50 --> 01:51:07.54
getting me off the line. The next section is called combat orders. The authority to issue orders

1986
01:51:07.54 --> 01:51:12.50
is an inherent function of command orders are normally issued to next subordinate commanders.

1987
01:51:12.50 --> 01:51:18.50
By passing the normal channels of command is resorted only to an urgent situations. It's such

1988
01:51:18.50 --> 01:51:23.46
cases both commander issuing the command or receiving the order should notify intermediate

1989
01:51:23.46 --> 01:51:28.82
commanders of its purport as soon as possible. So, trying not to jump the chain of command.

1990
01:51:30.42 --> 01:51:35.14
Well, orders may be either complete or fragmentary. The order is complete when it covers all the

1991
01:51:35.14 --> 01:51:40.66
essential aspects of the phases of operations. Complete orders include missions to all subordinate

1992
01:51:40.66 --> 01:51:44.82
units charged with the execution of tactical operations and carrying out the commander's plan.

1993
01:51:44.82 --> 01:51:52.42
So that's a complete order. Fragmentary orders. And by the way, there's no distinction between

1994
01:51:52.42 --> 01:52:00.18
these two things in the cupid funeral. So I think the pug was like no orders have to be detailed.

1995
01:52:00.18 --> 01:52:04.02
And the guys were like, okay, yep, you're Roger that, sir. But, you know, there's something

1996
01:52:04.02 --> 01:52:08.58
else that can happen maybe possibly like we call them. They made up fragmentary orders.

1997
01:52:08.58 --> 01:52:14.02
Fractory orders are used when speeding delivery and execution is imperative. Guess who it's

1998
01:52:14.02 --> 01:52:19.54
one you're going to do the most? Yeah, Frag orders are issued successfully as the situation

1999
01:52:19.54 --> 01:52:24.34
develops and as decisions are made and consist of separate instructions to one of the force

2000
01:52:24.34 --> 01:52:30.50
ofordinate units prescribed, prescribing each the part each is to play in the operation

2001
01:52:30.50 --> 01:52:36.34
in the separate phases thereof. This procedure will be usual in divisions and smaller units

2002
01:52:37.14 --> 01:52:43.78
that pugs knock that one in there. Fractory orders may be either all or written.

2003
01:52:45.62 --> 01:52:51.62
They are concise but not at the expense of clarity and omission of essential information. That's very,

2004
01:52:51.62 --> 01:53:00.18
very clear in the in the troupon funeral. Instructions issued in fragmentary orders may be repeated

2005
01:53:00.18 --> 01:53:06.50
in a complete field order or in an annex of considered desirable order should be originated sufficiently

2006
01:53:07.86 --> 01:53:13.30
sufficiently early and transmitted in such form as to permit subordinate commanders the maximum

2007
01:53:13.30 --> 01:53:18.58
superior periods to recon order to estimate their own situations to issue their orders

2008
01:53:19.38 --> 01:53:24.42
and to prepare their troops for the contemplated operation. In many situations, it may be necessary

2009
01:53:24.42 --> 01:53:34.10
or desirable to order a worn of impending operations warning order, a warning order contains information

2010
01:53:34.10 --> 01:53:41.22
which enables subordinate commanders to make preparations for a contemplated operation.

2011
01:53:41.22 --> 01:53:46.98
It's principal purposes to gain the time for preparatory measures and to conserve the energy of

2012
01:53:46.98 --> 01:53:51.70
the troops. So that is in the troupon funeral. The idea of a warning order and warning orders are

2013
01:53:51.70 --> 01:53:58.02
awesome. The be prepared to. Here's what we're probably going to do. It's going to look something like

2014
01:53:58.02 --> 01:54:03.78
this peck this gear think about that area of operations. And if I was going to take away something

2015
01:54:03.78 --> 01:54:08.58
from this that long section there if I'm a leader at a business or a key leader in an organization,

2016
01:54:09.14 --> 01:54:13.54
the takeaway for me is it may feel like you at the top of the workshop needs to

2017
01:54:15.14 --> 01:54:19.22
talk to most give the most information actually what you should do is the time that you should

2018
01:54:19.22 --> 01:54:23.78
maximize is your subordinate leaders going to figure out what they need to do to support your

2019
01:54:23.78 --> 01:54:28.26
overall mission. The least amount of information you can pass. It it it has to be the right amount of

2020
01:54:28.26 --> 01:54:32.90
information. But the more time you can give them to figure out their particular situation to support

2021
01:54:32.90 --> 01:54:38.34
that the better. Less talking more time for your people to go dear their job as opposed to let's

2022
01:54:38.34 --> 01:54:42.98
get everybody in the room. I'm going to talk all day long about every single detail and not give them

2023
01:54:42.98 --> 01:54:48.82
any time to go figure out that's that's opposite. So the frigo in the warning o that's probably 95% of

2024
01:54:48.82 --> 01:54:52.42
the way you're going to communicate is leader. Yeah once at your annual conference for for sure yeah

2025
01:54:52.42 --> 01:54:56.82
we need to spend some time we'll do that but that's not going to happen on day to day and the

2026
01:54:56.82 --> 01:55:00.82
West you talk is probably the better for your team because it gives them more time to lead.

2027
01:55:00.82 --> 01:55:08.18
Yeah and those those detailed plans are going to change. They're going to change. Yeah. So

2028
01:55:08.18 --> 01:55:14.58
you can you can if you got the relationships and you got the well trained people and you've got the

2029
01:55:14.58 --> 01:55:22.34
trust built man the orders are so freaking simple the give and and that was the thing with and I

2030
01:55:22.34 --> 01:55:27.14
didn't say this but that's the whole jumping the chain to command thing is what you really want

2031
01:55:27.14 --> 01:55:30.50
there are time look don't jump the chain to command if you can vote it for sure that's a good

2032
01:55:30.50 --> 01:55:36.74
blanket statement but the reality is is that are there times a jump the chain? Yes there are and the

2033
01:55:36.74 --> 01:55:41.70
best thing I have when I jump the chain to command is whoever that leader that I bypassed to give

2034
01:55:41.70 --> 01:55:46.10
direct orders or information to their folks if I got a really good relationship and a long history

2035
01:55:46.10 --> 01:55:50.42
of them they don't even care there's no factor and I say and I'm so about hey Jaco you weren't

2036
01:55:50.42 --> 01:55:53.70
around I had to make this thing happen this what we did in a while you're like good ago it sounds

2037
01:55:53.70 --> 01:56:00.90
good it's the pug it's the guy who really likes the chain to command so you shouldn't bypass me

2038
01:56:00.90 --> 01:56:06.10
to speak to my man is the guy who's most offended and it's probably the hardest relationship

2039
01:56:06.10 --> 01:56:11.22
because what that guy cares about the most is his positional authority and there's so much in there

2040
01:56:12.02 --> 01:56:15.78
on even the jump in the chain is you have a good relationship you can jump the channel all day long

2041
01:56:15.78 --> 01:56:19.22
and I'm not saying you should go out of your way to do it but sometimes it's required and strong

2042
01:56:19.22 --> 01:56:23.46
relationships and like yeah no factor thanks for giving the heads up my my guys back brief me anyway

2043
01:56:23.46 --> 01:56:28.02
we're all good I'm all in yeah they told me what they're doing I got it appreciate it thanks yeah

2044
01:56:28.02 --> 01:56:32.10
no factor people that are insecure about their leadership capabilities are the ones that really what

2045
01:56:32.10 --> 01:56:38.26
that's the that's the false the poll the lieutenant kernel poll I think he's actually a

2046
01:56:38.26 --> 01:56:43.62
kernel this poke kernel poke yeah no he's the senior guy yeah he's the senior guy and

2047
01:56:44.58 --> 01:56:56.58
yeah kernel poggies in the house for some of us orders an order should not trespass upon the

2048
01:56:56.58 --> 01:57:05.38
province of a subordinate it should contain everything that the subordinate must know to carry out

2049
01:57:05.38 --> 01:57:14.02
his mission but nothing more I really like that order should not trespass upon the province of a

2050
01:57:14.02 --> 01:57:19.14
subordinate yes like you got to let him run his thing tell him what he needs and then give him

2051
01:57:19.14 --> 01:57:25.54
all the time in the world you can't get let him go lead orders must be clear and explicit

2052
01:57:25.54 --> 01:57:32.10
and as brief as as is consistent with clarity short sentences are easily understood

2053
01:57:35.38 --> 01:57:39.86
you know they're like hey kernel kernel poke do you mind if we just say that short sentences

2054
01:57:39.86 --> 01:57:43.30
are easy to understand because some of the guys might not get that and he's like whoa I'd like

2055
01:57:43.30 --> 01:57:48.98
to talk to you about that for a while clarity is more important in technique the more urgent

2056
01:57:48.98 --> 01:57:53.70
the situation the greater the need for consciousness for conciseness in the order

2057
01:57:53.70 --> 01:58:00.74
think about that the more urgent the situation the greater the need for conciseness in the order

2058
01:58:01.54 --> 01:58:07.78
think it was Mark Twain that said I wanted to write you a short note but I didn't have time

2059
01:58:08.34 --> 01:58:13.22
so I'm writing you this long letter which is easier than writing something short and concise

2060
01:58:14.90 --> 01:58:21.62
I come back you tell the story a lot on the podcast and it's the bus that door just three

2061
01:58:21.62 --> 01:58:27.06
it's just this the simplest and the reason you have to say it like that is because there's actually

2062
01:58:27.06 --> 01:58:32.10
not any more time than you need to talk about hey well I feel like the enemy might be maneuvering

2063
01:58:33.14 --> 01:58:37.30
bus that door and they go and they go do that and then problem solved totally

2064
01:58:38.02 --> 01:58:44.10
any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to what is necessary to obtain

2065
01:58:44.10 --> 01:58:46.10
an intelligent cooperation from the subordinates

2066
01:58:46.10 --> 01:58:53.22
I'm reading that one again any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to

2067
01:58:53.22 --> 01:58:58.02
what is necessary to obtain intelligent cooperation from the subordinates there's a little bit

2068
01:58:58.02 --> 01:59:04.66
there's a little argument about that one because the the poll kernel poll was like they don't

2069
01:59:04.66 --> 01:59:08.34
you need to tell what to do you tell what to do and the other guys like listen you need to give

2070
01:59:08.34 --> 01:59:12.98
them some information on why this is happening and he's like no you don't and they said yes you

2071
01:59:12.98 --> 01:59:18.18
do and finally they wrote this statement it compromised yeah the compromise is like at least let them

2072
01:59:18.18 --> 01:59:25.30
know give them what's limited so that they have have the information and can understand why it's

2073
01:59:25.30 --> 01:59:32.02
happening now there are times when leaders give too much information and it overwhelms the machine gunner

2074
01:59:32.02 --> 01:59:36.50
who's like bro tell me what my field of fire is for sure you tell me that again

2075
01:59:36.50 --> 01:59:44.58
detailed instructions for a variety of contingencies or prescriptions that are a matter of training

2076
01:59:44.58 --> 01:59:47.54
do not inspire confidence and have no place in order

2077
01:59:49.14 --> 01:59:55.86
trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility and lead to the adoption of half measures

2078
01:59:55.86 --> 02:00:02.82
by subordinate by subordinates trivial and meaningless expressions they're actually telling you how to

2079
02:00:02.82 --> 02:00:10.18
write and how to speak yeah trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility and lead to the

2080
02:00:10.18 --> 02:00:19.70
adoption of half measures by subordinates exaggerated and bombastic phrases invite ridicule and

2081
02:00:19.70 --> 02:00:32.42
weaken the force of an order you cannot do that you cannot use exaggerated and bombastic phrases

2082
02:00:34.34 --> 02:00:42.82
what what happens is you think you're not getting the message apart to your people yeah you think

2083
02:00:42.82 --> 02:00:47.78
that they don't get it if we don't do this it's going to destroy the company and you're thinking

2084
02:00:47.78 --> 02:00:52.66
the go I better pay attention and actually all that does is just undermine your message like bro yeah

2085
02:00:52.66 --> 02:01:00.42
hang on that it's not going to destroy the company if you're the leader that if you can have

2086
02:01:00.42 --> 02:01:04.82
these limited recognized you're the one that covers all these little detailed points your people are

2087
02:01:04.82 --> 02:01:08.66
tuning you out they're tuning you out and actually what's going to happen is they're going to

2088
02:01:08.66 --> 02:01:14.66
miss the important things so you just need to say just the important things yeah what you do is

2089
02:01:14.66 --> 02:01:20.02
you paint yourself into a corner totally because if you're talking and you're saying this and

2090
02:01:20.02 --> 02:01:22.50
you're saying that and then you're saying this and then you're saying that and then you finally

2091
02:01:22.50 --> 02:01:25.70
want to say something important you want to make sure everyone pays attention so you put an

2092
02:01:25.70 --> 02:01:31.54
exaggeration or you make it a bombastic phrase and then what you're end up doing is now you're

2093
02:01:31.54 --> 02:01:36.50
making exaggerations and bombastic phrases all the time they have the impact and you're the

2094
02:01:36.50 --> 02:01:40.26
you end up the the the boy that cried once last muster somebody asked you a question and the

2095
02:01:40.26 --> 02:01:44.66
answer was basically kind of like how much talking how much listening and you're like 98%

2096
02:01:44.66 --> 02:01:49.94
listening 2% talking and you pause and you're like now that I've thought about it that's the

2097
02:01:49.94 --> 02:01:55.86
perfect ratio is just the least amount of things you can say to pass the peran information and then

2098
02:01:55.86 --> 02:02:01.38
stop talking and if it's the the only way to compel your people to do it is that the risk is

2099
02:02:01.38 --> 02:02:07.54
total destruction then the one in a million times that actually it could be total destruction

2100
02:02:07.54 --> 02:02:10.82
they actually don't respond the way they need to they don't care because you've been saying that

2101
02:02:10.82 --> 02:02:16.58
this could crush us this could destroy us like the one time that's that's true they've filtered

2102
02:02:16.58 --> 02:02:24.74
you out years ago yeah yeah 98% of the time use your ears 2% of the time use your mouth

2103
02:02:26.10 --> 02:02:33.14
I I would not talk on the radio in task being a bruiser as a particular I would not talk on the

2104
02:02:33.14 --> 02:02:40.18
radio when I talked everybody listened totally and same thing you know when when one of

2105
02:02:40.18 --> 02:02:44.82
two commanders are given a brief I'm not talking I got three things to say at the end maybe two

2106
02:02:45.54 --> 02:02:48.82
here's what's important that's what you can do think about boom

2107
02:02:51.30 --> 02:02:57.38
expressions such as attack vigorously if used in orders are not only verbose and meaning

2108
02:02:57.38 --> 02:03:01.70
less but 10 to week in the force of subsequent orders in which such expressions are not there

2109
02:03:01.70 --> 02:03:05.70
that's exactly what you were to say like you're gonna run out of adjectives bro

2110
02:03:08.10 --> 02:03:13.22
this is critically important yeah yeah yeah there's the hierarchy of adjectives and you're

2111
02:03:13.22 --> 02:03:18.18
gonna reach the end of it which is gonna suck next orders to prescribe only so far as conditions

2112
02:03:18.18 --> 02:03:22.74
can be for scene orders which attempt to regulate matters too far in the future resultant frequent

2113
02:03:22.74 --> 02:03:27.70
changes frequent changes in orders overload the means of signal communication cause confusion

2114
02:03:27.70 --> 02:03:33.54
misunderstanding impose needless hardship on the troops and injure them around so there you go

2115
02:03:34.26 --> 02:03:38.02
that's freaking epic right there totally you you sit there and you're trying to

2116
02:03:39.06 --> 02:03:42.42
what I just said this deep we're gonna come out with a detail plan of how it's gonna go from day one

2117
02:03:42.42 --> 02:03:51.46
to day 19 no you're not you're not and no one is and it it pisses your guys off

2118
02:03:51.46 --> 02:03:56.82
for sure pisses them off for sure but I learned this lesson so I was on an argument deployment

2119
02:03:56.82 --> 02:04:03.30
which meant I was on a ship and we were planning for some mission and at first they said okay you're

2120
02:04:03.30 --> 02:04:08.90
gonna launch from you're gonna launch from the boats the the the rib boats the rigid

2121
02:04:08.90 --> 02:04:12.02
hold flatable boats you load your zodiacs on there to put them in the water and you guys will

2122
02:04:12.02 --> 02:04:16.26
go do your mission and so we start prepping for that and then they come back and they say

2123
02:04:16.26 --> 02:04:22.82
actually sorry our bus you're gonna use helicopters so we're like okay now this is a totally

2124
02:04:22.82 --> 02:04:28.34
different rigging exercise I mean completely different we have to we so we have to bring the zodiacs

2125
02:04:28.34 --> 02:04:36.58
which we had rigged for boat launch we had to completely break them down and now rigged them to

2126
02:04:36.58 --> 02:04:42.18
go inside of a CH 46 and get kicked out the back and then we jump in the water we go this takes us

2127
02:04:42.74 --> 02:04:50.50
I'm not even kidding this takes six hours of hard labor and our five and a half comes back

2128
02:04:50.50 --> 02:04:57.70
actually you're not using he loves your using boats again and there was like borderline just

2129
02:04:57.70 --> 02:05:03.46
total breakdown of Chay to compare like are you kidding me because guess what we hadn't planned

2130
02:05:03.46 --> 02:05:08.90
anything we hadn't done any of our personal gear prep all we were doing was and and when you're on an

2131
02:05:08.90 --> 02:05:16.90
arg like you you go check out bringing a 55 horsepower engine from the flight deck next to the ribs

2132
02:05:16.90 --> 02:05:22.02
down into the well back you know and then you do that with every piece of gear that you have

2133
02:05:22.02 --> 02:05:27.78
well it it was just stupid and and of course this was a three minute conversation this is a

2134
02:05:27.78 --> 02:05:33.78
decision a three minute conversation and a four-second decision that my upper chain of command

2135
02:05:33.78 --> 02:05:38.18
above my patoon commanders you know was like oh it'd be good to get him some work in a he loves

2136
02:05:38.18 --> 02:05:42.26
okay well yeah let's get the he loves going have him get ready for a he-lo it wasn't like okay

2137
02:05:42.26 --> 02:05:49.06
are they committed no they just made a little decision and and I learned that in that moment in time

2138
02:05:50.74 --> 02:05:58.58
when you're the guy in charge you better know what the hell your decisions yeah how your decision

2139
02:05:58.58 --> 02:06:03.62
impact the list because not I look wasn't hard work yes but was even worse than the fact

2140
02:06:03.62 --> 02:06:08.10
there was hard work we were not prepared now we had wasted it took us another six hours to get

2141
02:06:08.10 --> 02:06:12.42
everything deregged so we were not planning the way we should have been planning because we were

2142
02:06:12.42 --> 02:06:22.10
running around like idiots wasting time wasting time orders issued by subordinates should not

2143
02:06:22.10 --> 02:06:27.62
be mere repetition of those from higher authority with additions of their own new orders are

2144
02:06:27.62 --> 02:06:35.86
clearer and more satisfactory as a rule is desirable to keep contemplated operation secrets

2145
02:06:35.86 --> 02:06:40.42
long as possible and to confine knowledge they're of to new to a few staff officers and senior

2146
02:06:40.42 --> 02:06:46.74
commanders however upon entry into action no unit should be endowed as to what the commander wants to do

2147
02:06:49.70 --> 02:06:54.10
whenever knowledge of his intentions is necessary to ensure the cooperation of units engaged

2148
02:06:54.10 --> 02:07:00.58
the commander does not hesitate to disclose them to all concerned ignorance of his intentions may

2149
02:07:00.58 --> 02:07:07.14
often lead to inactivity on the port on the part of subordinates commanders intent is the actual

2150
02:07:07.14 --> 02:07:12.66
thing that you lead with it's the most important piece of information of all of it and when we

2151
02:07:12.66 --> 02:07:18.18
work with companies all the time there's this phrase that people know it's like if you ever hear

2152
02:07:18.18 --> 02:07:23.86
yourself or the people around you saying you don't need to know that just do your job man

2153
02:07:23.86 --> 02:07:34.66
the likely heard of success is basically zero check it is impossible to prescribe detailed

2154
02:07:34.66 --> 02:07:40.66
forms of orders to fit every tactical situation to attempt to do so would result in rigid form

2155
02:07:40.66 --> 02:07:45.22
and a routine style of expression which would not be in accord with the in accord with the

2156
02:07:45.22 --> 02:07:52.18
tactical requirements presented by the diverse situations that arise in war you don't know what's

2157
02:07:52.18 --> 02:07:55.86
going to happen that circles back i think to the first sentence you read and war is like you can't

2158
02:07:55.86 --> 02:08:02.66
script the answer you don't know what's going to happen to the extent practical however it has

2159
02:08:02.66 --> 02:08:07.78
been found efficient and convenient to classify combat orders according to their purpose and scope

2160
02:08:07.78 --> 02:08:12.82
of for some of these to adopt a standard sequence of composition this makes for the ease of understanding

2161
02:08:12.82 --> 02:08:16.58
a voice of omissions and ready reference yeah for sure that's where you get smiac which they

2162
02:08:16.58 --> 02:08:23.70
surprisingly don't cover they cover it in through perfuring but they don't cover it in this one um

2163
02:08:23.70 --> 02:08:28.98
but that's what they're talking about moral experiences shown that an order which can be

2164
02:08:28.98 --> 02:08:36.26
misunderstood will be misunderstood and an experience is shown that an order that which can be

2165
02:08:36.26 --> 02:08:44.10
misunderstood will be misunderstood and to obviate the designations of boundaries details of time

2166
02:08:44.10 --> 02:08:51.14
in place military terminology abbreviations designations of units and the like for details related to

2167
02:08:51.14 --> 02:08:57.38
these matters cfm 101 tack five and i wrote tack one which is the operational turns and graphics

2168
02:08:57.38 --> 02:09:04.34
which in the seal teams when the war kicked off we were not we didn't know what we were doing

2169
02:09:04.34 --> 02:09:10.02
like in terms of operational terms and graphics we just kind of drew arrows and like made it obvious

2170
02:09:10.02 --> 02:09:16.74
to the guys in the platoon like hey move there bad guys there we didn't we didn't realize that there

2171
02:09:16.74 --> 02:09:26.50
was an actual an actual language that was utilized throughout all i remember when i was trying to

2172
02:09:26.50 --> 02:09:32.26
convince people that we entire military oh it's through it's not just through our military it's all

2173
02:09:32.26 --> 02:09:37.94
NATO forces by the way because i remember having i would be like hey listen you know you need to put

2174
02:09:37.94 --> 02:09:43.06
this stuff in here there's this manual it's called the 101 tack i used it literally have the 101

2175
02:09:43.06 --> 02:09:48.42
tack five tack one i had a printed copy and i had it in my bathroom i had like one copy of my bathroom

2176
02:09:48.42 --> 02:09:53.38
and i would read through it you know because at some point i think i was probably

2177
02:09:56.82 --> 02:10:02.82
i think i was probably a platoon commander and i realized like oh everyone uses this but us

2178
02:10:02.82 --> 02:10:09.70
okay so i just started trying to learn terms and you know because we we don't have the basics

2179
02:10:09.70 --> 02:10:15.22
school in the seal teams we don't even have you know advanced infantry training like they have

2180
02:10:15.22 --> 02:10:20.18
in the army where you're gonna you you you go through platoon work but it's this isolated thing right

2181
02:10:20.18 --> 02:10:24.74
it's this isolated thing and luckily i did two-hour deployments where we worked in Marine Corps

2182
02:10:24.74 --> 02:10:32.26
extensively which was awesome and i got my taste and my indoctrination in how the rest of the

2183
02:10:32.26 --> 02:10:36.18
freaking military works because you got big navy you got the Marine Corps you got Marine Corps

2184
02:10:36.18 --> 02:10:41.46
air it was awesome i was so lucky that i got put in those situations and that's kind of where i

2185
02:10:41.46 --> 02:10:44.74
first would see these things i'd be like oh that's an interesting symbol but you know it was

2186
02:10:44.74 --> 02:10:50.50
pre-internet it wasn't like you could it wasn't like i could explore this idea but yeah i used to

2187
02:10:50.50 --> 02:10:56.58
have one of those next to my bit but i remember trying to i would be telling guys like hey the symbol

2188
02:10:56.58 --> 02:11:02.10
for the enemy actually isn't a red axe it's it's a diamond yeah and they'd be like well that's

2189
02:11:02.10 --> 02:11:08.02
you know no no one's gonna know what that means actually everyone in NATO forces knows what

2190
02:11:08.02 --> 02:11:12.74
that means the only people that don't know is the 16 guys in your seal platoon how about we get on

2191
02:11:12.74 --> 02:11:22.90
board with what everyone else in the military is doing uh check and now we get this is the last

2192
02:11:22.90 --> 02:11:31.46
section that's you know that's that's covered worth covering in every unit standing operating

2193
02:11:31.46 --> 02:11:41.14
procedures is prescribed by the commander wherever practicable this procedures covers those features

2194
02:11:41.14 --> 02:11:45.06
of the operation which lend themselves to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of

2195
02:11:45.06 --> 02:11:50.74
effect in this the adoption of such procedures will save time in the preparation and issuance of

2196
02:11:50.74 --> 02:11:56.34
orders minimize the chances for confusion and errors when under stress of combat and greatly

2197
02:11:56.34 --> 02:12:02.58
simplify and expedite the execution of operations in the field pretty state straightforward

2198
02:12:02.58 --> 02:12:09.30
and they close out talking about command posts which nothing they talk about signal communication

2199
02:12:09.30 --> 02:12:16.98
which you know this is very tactical level stuff like how you're gonna communicate

2200
02:12:16.98 --> 02:12:23.94
at during this time period with uh with message centers and advanced mess i mean it's it's like

2201
02:12:23.94 --> 02:12:29.86
the actual how they're doing it so it's not super applicable other than the stuff that we've

2202
02:12:29.86 --> 02:12:34.34
already covered about things being simple clear and concise I mean literally airplane messages

2203
02:12:34.34 --> 02:12:38.42
may be employed when distance intervening obstacles on the ground enough factors prevent use of

2204
02:12:38.42 --> 02:12:43.54
other means so that's what it's talking about it's it is actually talking to take a one step further

2205
02:12:43.54 --> 02:12:47.62
homing pigeons are a mean communication from front to rear when other means a shell so that's where

2206
02:12:47.62 --> 02:12:51.30
we're at i'm not gonna dive into all those things even though they are interesting and fascinating

2207
02:12:51.30 --> 02:12:57.54
and we can i'm sure learn something but we're not gonna dive too deep so that's that's kind of

2208
02:12:57.54 --> 02:13:04.98
where it wraps up and as i mentioned before the the 1944 version if if you look at that the the

2209
02:13:04.98 --> 02:13:12.18
other than the differences don't want to point it out there's an entire big section of air power

2210
02:13:12.18 --> 02:13:18.26
and and how you utilize it and then there's more granular tactics but again we're talking it's a

2211
02:13:18.26 --> 02:13:27.38
little bit homing pigeon fish you know not not readily applicable as leaders but the but the

2212
02:13:27.38 --> 02:13:34.82
leadership principles other than that one sentence that we pointed out other than that one sentence

2213
02:13:34.82 --> 02:13:43.14
it's almost it doesn't change and it's very similar to the true inferior which is very similar

2214
02:13:43.14 --> 02:13:47.86
to everything that we talk about all the time good leadership requires understanding people

2215
02:13:48.90 --> 02:13:56.42
good leadership means you have to care about your men you have to as the book says show a constant

2216
02:13:56.42 --> 02:14:01.46
concern for their comfort and welfare how about you make that a priority as a leader

2217
02:14:01.46 --> 02:14:12.98
you can't unnecessarily tax the endurance of the troops discipline is the main cohesive

2218
02:14:12.98 --> 02:14:22.74
force in a unit good morale cannot be improvised and and finally through offensive action

2219
02:14:23.70 --> 02:14:30.34
through offensive action the commander exercises his initiative preserve his freedom of action

2220
02:14:30.34 --> 02:14:41.70
and imposes his will on the enemy that's what we need to do is go on the offense on all fronts

2221
02:14:44.02 --> 02:14:51.06
don't wait for orders don't wait for the intel to be perfect

2222
02:14:52.66 --> 02:14:58.26
and if you have to be on the defense don't stay there look for that moment in time where you can

2223
02:14:58.26 --> 02:15:09.54
flip this scenario go on the offense take ground move forward and impose your will on the enemy

2224
02:15:09.54 --> 02:15:15.70
and yes that does translate to business and it certainly translates to what you do with your life

2225
02:15:16.50 --> 02:15:23.46
the it go on offense when you wake up in the morning that's what you do don't wait to react

2226
02:15:23.46 --> 02:15:32.34
you'll end up on the defense and you will eventually get taken out and I think that's all

2227
02:15:32.34 --> 02:15:41.38
it got for this one anything else crazy isn't it so good man somebody will reach out to me and

2228
02:15:41.38 --> 02:15:45.38
tell me who wrote this yeah that's what's gonna happen yeah somebody will reach out to me

2229
02:15:45.38 --> 02:15:56.66
somebody reached out to me I've got a track on the FM one-tack three I've got a master I think it's

2230
02:15:56.66 --> 02:16:06.82
a master gun resargent that was in the room who is a Vietnam guy yeah who's like oh you know it's

2231
02:16:06.82 --> 02:16:14.42
I I want to say his son I think his son reached out to me hey just kind of F or maybe it was one of the

2232
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:20.74
guys who surf with him hey just FYI you know this guy was in the room we had a big part writing it

2233
02:16:20.74 --> 02:16:28.66
and you know if you want to ask him some questions I'm like a 100% unfortunately since Colonel

2234
02:16:28.66 --> 02:16:33.46
Pogue was probably 48 years old when he was doing this we won't get him in the room we don't need

2235
02:16:33.46 --> 02:16:38.66
him in the room no you know the timing of that when you start when you look at the timing one

2236
02:16:38.66 --> 02:16:44.66
there written I mean the takeaway you think about is you learn the hardest lessons from the most

2237
02:16:44.66 --> 02:16:49.54
difficult situations and you learn the hardest lessons from the most challenging environments with

2238
02:16:49.54 --> 02:16:58.18
your team and just think about how different the world was from 1920 to 1940 and then from 1941 to

2239
02:16:58.18 --> 02:17:05.86
1943 yeah and even if you looked at if you had a closed mind and you were looking at World War

2240
02:17:05.86 --> 02:17:11.38
one even if even if Colonel Pogue served in World War one what he took away from that was like

2241
02:17:11.38 --> 02:17:15.62
listen when I say charge there's just problems there's people that don't charge when I say

2242
02:17:15.62 --> 02:17:21.22
charge that's horrible he might have been infatically saying listen obedience is the most important

2243
02:17:21.22 --> 02:17:24.98
thing and there were some guys that were came back and you know when he said it at the first time

2244
02:17:24.98 --> 02:17:31.06
they were like hey I know you were a platoon commander but like I was over here and we actually

2245
02:17:31.06 --> 02:17:35.06
needed to think about what we were doing then after three years of war they just shut him down

2246
02:17:35.06 --> 02:17:41.94
and said hey the methods that you used in World War one sucked and if we would have trained our

2247
02:17:41.94 --> 02:17:47.46
troops to say hey boss that's a dumb idea we should not get up and charge this we should not go

2248
02:17:47.46 --> 02:17:56.02
and online at 0600 when the when the bugle sounds I'm not doing it and we should not do it

2249
02:17:56.02 --> 02:18:04.26
should not do this because we are going to lose 480 men when that bugle sounds and that's stupid

2250
02:18:04.26 --> 02:18:13.54
yeah because we're going to get nothing out of it and so that's what we want and that's what

2251
02:18:13.54 --> 02:18:20.90
this whole book begs for at least at least that at least the the the other guys in the room

2252
02:18:20.90 --> 02:18:28.58
beg for people think that's what they beg for use your initiative question your boss

2253
02:18:28.58 --> 02:18:35.30
if your boss can't explain why we're doing something then he's doing it wrong and a leader who

2254
02:18:35.30 --> 02:18:40.18
has subordinates put that pushback and you hey boss hey I don't get this I don't think this is right

2255
02:18:42.02 --> 02:18:47.38
that's the best leadership you can have I want my guys to go hey hang on I don't understand this

2256
02:18:48.98 --> 02:18:54.42
that's the best feedback I could possibly get which is them saying timeout I don't understand

2257
02:18:54.42 --> 02:18:59.62
we need to keep talking about this as opposed to one of two things the sort of this blind loyalty

2258
02:18:59.62 --> 02:19:03.86
whether just do whatever I say because there's no way I've got it all right or worse they think

2259
02:19:04.50 --> 02:19:10.10
this guy's an idiot and it's not even worth talking to him about it how disconnected those people are

2260
02:19:10.10 --> 02:19:15.94
you if you're a leader you want your people pushing back you want them asking you hard questions and

2261
02:19:15.94 --> 02:19:22.50
if you can't answer their questions you have more work to do yeah and and if you're smart

2262
02:19:22.50 --> 02:19:29.94
the ones that you will charge with answering those questions is those men themselves that are asking

2263
02:19:29.94 --> 02:19:34.34
them because if they say why are we coming in from the west you say well I thought it look good

2264
02:19:34.90 --> 02:19:40.66
please tell me why you don't think that's gonna work go do a better map study then I did by the

2265
02:19:40.66 --> 02:19:45.38
way because I got three other elements that I'm looking at but cool you come up with a better plan please

2266
02:19:45.38 --> 02:19:53.14
we're standing my for that so yeah these these principles of combat man these principles of

2267
02:19:53.14 --> 02:20:03.94
leadership they just don't change and it's so it's crazy that in 2019 right now you and I can

2268
02:20:03.94 --> 02:20:11.94
work with leaders you and I can meet leaders that are 100% aligned with Colonel Pogue yeah

2269
02:20:11.94 --> 02:20:17.94
there 100% aligned with Colonel Pogue they're attitude is listen hey what I want is people just

2270
02:20:17.94 --> 02:20:22.58
doing I tell them to do and God that sounds good doesn't it this sounds great hey if he's going

2271
02:20:22.58 --> 02:20:27.06
to just do what I told him to do here's the problem you're not that freaking smart you don't even know

2272
02:20:27.06 --> 02:20:32.34
what they should do how can you you're not moving from lines you're not seeing what's happening you're

2273
02:20:32.34 --> 02:20:37.46
not in that manufacturer you're not on that line you're not on that construction site you're not in

2274
02:20:37.46 --> 02:20:44.26
that in that meeting you're you're you're you're supposed to be looking up and out so how can you

2275
02:20:44.26 --> 02:20:56.02
know what's going on down there you don't let your people lead all right so speaking of going on

2276
02:20:56.02 --> 02:21:00.02
offense we kind of want to go on offense in our lives I think that's a smart thing to do

2277
02:21:00.02 --> 02:21:09.06
train you jitsu train you jitsu how many things you will be able to relate to jitsu is infinite

2278
02:21:09.06 --> 02:21:14.26
it's going to make you better leader it's going to make you a better boss it's going to make you better

2279
02:21:14.26 --> 02:21:19.62
follower it's going to make you a better dad make you better mom make you better human being

2280
02:21:20.90 --> 02:21:25.70
and any it hopefully get your kids doing it too it's going to help them even more get them in the game

2281
02:21:25.70 --> 02:21:34.02
so yeah jitsu if you need you jitsu ghee then get one from a place called origin origin main dot com

2282
02:21:35.06 --> 02:21:44.34
where we're not just up there selling geese what we're doing is up there bringing manufacturing

2283
02:21:44.34 --> 02:21:51.70
back to America that's what we're doing that's where belongs highest quality it supports this podcast

2284
02:21:51.70 --> 02:21:56.42
if you like this podcast go to origin and get something that supports the podcast but more important

2285
02:21:56.42 --> 02:22:04.26
like I said it supports the United States of America it supports the community up there that's what we're

2286
02:22:04.26 --> 02:22:12.82
doing so origin main you can get t-shirts you can get joggers which I personally don't wear but I

2287
02:22:12.82 --> 02:22:20.18
got to I'm going to say hoodies and jeans by the way jeans best jeans ever do you everywhere jeans

2288
02:22:20.18 --> 02:22:27.46
Dave I cannot remember the last time of origins and I know that's you just wear shorts all

2289
02:22:27.46 --> 02:22:32.66
the time when I lived in Virginia my criteria for shorts is it had to be below freezing so when

2290
02:22:32.66 --> 02:22:37.70
you get a gig in New York City in January and you're flying out there what are you wearing on the

2291
02:22:37.70 --> 02:22:45.14
point shorts really shorts at a national unfront t-shirt or a origin main t-shirt I might bring a

2292
02:22:45.14 --> 02:22:51.30
hoodie if I think it's going to be chilly check so a hundred percent you're wearing shorts

2293
02:22:52.34 --> 02:22:58.34
one hundred percent now here's here's one I look at a little caveat okay so 99 percent guess what I don't

2294
02:22:58.34 --> 02:23:06.82
have yet oh oh oh day I'll tell you what so that's that's I'm sorry you know I see what you're doing

2295
02:23:06.82 --> 02:23:11.54
so right now we have the heavyweight jeans and they're not they're not heavyweight they're not

2296
02:23:11.54 --> 02:23:19.22
heavy your weight then they're just normal jeans I got jeans right now that are lightweight jeans

2297
02:23:20.26 --> 02:23:25.30
and they're freaking the best things ever all right there is one thing that will push me off the

2298
02:23:25.30 --> 02:23:31.70
100 percent shorts that's the one yeah so that's my guess we got the material in um yeah it's you know

2299
02:23:32.58 --> 02:23:38.82
made in America woven to grown in America so so anyways yep jeans the I'm going to call I think the

2300
02:23:38.82 --> 02:23:47.46
name of the jeans is going to be May Kong 68 because if you don't know this the Vietnam

2301
02:23:47.46 --> 02:23:55.06
Seals my forefathers the people that gave me everything I have today in the May Kong Delta

2302
02:23:55.86 --> 02:24:03.14
of Vietnam the fatigues that we were that the seals were issued weren't durable enough for the

2303
02:24:03.14 --> 02:24:15.46
operations that they were doing so they wore blue jeans and so May Kong 68 jeans and also

2304

2316
02:25:47.06 --> 02:25:53.14

2317
02:25:53.14 --> 02:25:57.62
we know he might be right there's some evidence out there I saw on twitter the other day I posted

2318
02:25:57.62 --> 02:26:03.06

2335
02:27:45.30 --> 02:27:52.90
and you can see echoes completely overly enhanced videos where things are blowing up

2336
02:27:52.90 --> 02:28:01.06
it's the worst over use of special effects while they're being smashed while they're being smashed

2337
02:28:01.06 --> 02:28:10.10
things are exploding but a lot of people like them including echo psychological warfare if you need that

2338
02:28:10.10 --> 02:28:17.38
little a little shot in the brain if you need it you can get it from psychological war for an

2339
02:28:17.38 --> 02:28:24.42
iTunes MP3 platforms of all kinds flipside canvas dot com that's Dakota Myers company and he's making

2340
02:28:26.42 --> 02:28:32.42
shot in the arm that you can hang on the wall that's what it is a shot in the arm that you can hang

2341
02:28:32.42 --> 02:28:36.98
on the wall so you wake up every morning you can see something that says discipline equals freedom

2342
02:28:36.98 --> 02:28:45.30
I got some books the next book to come out is called leadership strategy and tactics field manual

2343
02:28:48.02 --> 02:28:54.58
you can preorder it right now if you want the first edition I was talking to my publisher the other day

2344
02:28:55.62 --> 02:29:02.74
and we're talking about what to do I said listen my people are there they want the first

2345
02:29:02.74 --> 02:29:08.74
edition and I want them to know that they got the first edition so we're going to do something

2346
02:29:08.74 --> 02:29:13.78
a lot of hundred percent sure yet but something to indicate at least that's the plan something to indicate

2347
02:29:14.18 --> 02:29:20.34
that you got that first edition so you get one chance to be on the first edition train

2348
02:29:21.70 --> 02:29:25.94
and then you're forever well I guess you could buy a used one for thousands of dollars off of

2349
02:29:25.94 --> 02:29:32.50
eBay if you missed the if you missed the initial first the distrained and you know what'll

2350
02:29:32.50 --> 02:29:37.30
let that happen so so leadership strategy and tactics really break down this stuff on a granular

2351
02:29:37.30 --> 02:29:46.26
level on how to apply it in specific situations that you're in preorder that we're now way

2352
02:29:46.26 --> 02:29:50.10
the way your kid there's three of them the most recent is where there's a will

2353
02:29:50.10 --> 02:30:01.38
you're daughter it seems to be mega on the path right yeah I mean you got to be so proud

2354
02:30:02.10 --> 02:30:07.06
dude she is dialed in man I'm I'm stoked and and we actually were talking about it the

2355
02:30:07.06 --> 02:30:13.06
other day she is she had a right a little letter all the kids in the started school they had

2356
02:30:13.06 --> 02:30:16.58
a right a little bio about themselves and kind of put it up in the wall to introduce themselves

2357
02:30:16.58 --> 02:30:21.94
to the class and inside that biography it was talking about things that are important to you

2358
02:30:21.94 --> 02:30:28.50
what do you think you like she used the phrase discipline she used the phrase ownership she said

2359
02:30:29.38 --> 02:30:33.46
good people don't make excuses I didn't even know she wrote it so I went to back to school

2360
02:30:33.46 --> 02:30:38.34
in that a couple weeks ago and I read it took a picture of it I'm like man this kid is so far ahead

2361
02:30:38.34 --> 02:30:44.42
of where I was at that age it's Uncle Jake's been a good influence in her life

2362
02:30:44.42 --> 02:30:50.18
Uncle Jake he has lessons for everyone but the problem is kids don't listen to their parents

2363
02:30:51.38 --> 02:30:55.70
like they listen Uncle Jake it's just the way it is my own kids don't listen to me as much

2364
02:30:55.70 --> 02:31:01.30
as they listen Uncle Jake that's just the way it is yeah their programmed to rebel against you

2365
02:31:01.30 --> 02:31:06.82
they have to otherwise they'll be living at home when they're 38 years old you don't want that you

2366
02:31:06.82 --> 02:31:12.42
want them to rebel against you but when they look outside for guidance you want them to find the

2367
02:31:12.42 --> 02:31:17.78
right guidance there's Uncle Jake standing at a rigid parade rest ready to put out the word

2368
02:31:18.82 --> 02:31:22.66
and if you're a parent you've now know and you're listening you now know you have those

2369
02:31:22.66 --> 02:31:26.34
resources available to you because if you're like most parents when your kid rebels you know

2370
02:31:26.34 --> 02:31:31.22
what most of us do we squash that which is the worst thing you can do personally first of all

2371
02:31:31.22 --> 02:31:36.82
a way further and now you can say hey look I understand and now you've got some other you got some

2372
02:31:36.82 --> 02:31:40.66
flanking maneuvers you can implement and have them because they're going to think they're

2373
02:31:40.66 --> 02:31:43.94
figuring it out on their own which in some ways they are but the reason they're even getting

2374
02:31:43.94 --> 02:31:50.66
there in the first place is because of you that's legit so way the warrior kid one two and three

2375
02:31:50.66 --> 02:31:54.02
the first one's called way the warrior kid the second one's marks mission the third one is

2376
02:31:54.02 --> 02:31:59.22
way the warrior kid through where there's a will got Mikey in the dragons how you gonna like just

2377
02:31:59.22 --> 02:32:08.42
had this when I was on a field on this guy had he had called in the last time and had a kid on the

2378
02:32:08.42 --> 02:32:15.14
way he was super freaked out and scared and he was like what should I do and you know it's like

2379
02:32:15.14 --> 02:32:22.74
okay here's a plan to go forward and then we called him yesterday called the guy back and he's like

2380
02:32:22.74 --> 02:32:27.70
yeah I got the kid and it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be in fact it's actually amazing

2381
02:32:27.70 --> 02:32:31.62
and I was like yeah those dragons on this dragon's on this big is you think they're going to be so

2382
02:32:31.62 --> 02:32:36.66
Mikey the dragon teacher kids to overcome teacher kids to stand up teach your kids to understand

2383
02:32:36.66 --> 02:32:42.98
what fear is and how they can actually react to it in a positive way Mikey in the dragons

2384
02:32:43.62 --> 02:32:48.82
get that book for kids that you know man it's another book I wish I had when I was little

2385
02:32:49.54 --> 02:32:56.26
uh this one goes for you to field manual how to get after it yes you need that manual that's another one

2386
02:32:56.26 --> 02:33:03.22
you what do you need to read to that a day read one page read one page and calibrate your brain

2387
02:33:03.22 --> 02:33:10.34
for the day that's what it is brain calibration calibrate your brain one page a day it'll take you

2388
02:33:10.34 --> 02:33:17.22

2420
02:36:42.74 --> 02:36:46.90
you're going through the books anytime I'm on the podcast which is completely awesome I get a

2421
02:36:46.90 --> 02:36:51.54
lot of hits on social media asking me about the eminently qualified human being a project

2422
02:36:51.54 --> 02:36:59.86
mm-hmm let me 74 174 one 74 podcast 174 let me tell you why you don't have that yet

2423
02:37:00.50 --> 02:37:09.06
is because I simply haven't done a good enough job getting it done it is close but I am not doing

2424
02:37:09.06 --> 02:37:15.62
my job we are getting very close that is coming out soon I will I will finish that project

2425
02:37:15.62 --> 02:37:21.86
and I will get that done what about the app we are we finished an awesome beta test thank you for

2426
02:37:21.86 --> 02:37:27.06
all of you out there that were dialed in on that we are close on that as well and what you're going to

2427
02:37:27.06 --> 02:37:32.02
see pretty soon is the app getting released and hopefully a digital version of that but you guys

2428
02:37:32.02 --> 02:37:35.86
are asking the questions the answer is I'm just not doing a good enough job it's coming soon

2429
02:37:36.26 --> 02:37:41.30
the interesting thing about and I know this went when I said this to you you were like what

2430
02:37:41.30 --> 02:37:45.86
and I was like hey well we'll get an app out you know we can build an app and release that

2431
02:37:45.86 --> 02:37:50.66
like soon as soon as possible and you're like well wouldn't it be easier to like just print a

2432
02:37:50.66 --> 02:37:58.66
publish a book and I'm like nope believe it or not it's a archaic system and we're not I don't

2433
02:37:58.66 --> 02:38:06.18
we're not 100% certain of how we're going to roll that out but the priority is speed right

2434
02:38:06.18 --> 02:38:15.06
this priority of getting the eminently qualified human being app and document book which we've also

2435
02:38:16.34 --> 02:38:21.38
well we've we've actually we actually see we had a little mission creep right little mission

2436
02:38:21.38 --> 02:38:27.78
creep because as I'm looking at it I'm thinking hey this is cool this is awesome but guess what there's

2437
02:38:27.78 --> 02:38:32.50
some protocols that we could give people to be grew so now we've got some protocols in there for

2438
02:38:32.50 --> 02:38:37.06
kind of standard operating procedures for things that go down in your life and they're really good

2439
02:38:37.62 --> 02:38:42.02
they I didn't have that big picture vision we started working on it but with that some folks can

2440
02:38:42.02 --> 02:38:47.54
ship you to that a lot of a lot of things are going into it it's certainly bigger but it ain't it's

2441
02:38:47.54 --> 02:38:51.70
it's actually where it needs to be yeah it's pretty close right now here it's close man

2442
02:38:52.90 --> 02:38:57.78
we got to just get out there okay cool so that's that and obviously once again

2443
02:38:57.78 --> 02:39:06.18
we would not even be sitting in this room at all if it were not for our brave and courageous

2444
02:39:06.18 --> 02:39:14.34
military men and women around the world so thanks to all of you that have served and those that are

2445
02:39:14.34 --> 02:39:21.62
currently serving thank you and the same goes to our police and law enforcement the firefighters out there

2446
02:39:21.62 --> 02:39:28.26
the paramedics the EMTs the dispatchers the correctional officers the border patrol the

2447
02:39:28.26 --> 02:39:34.90
secret service to all the first responders once again without you we cannot live the life

2448
02:39:34.90 --> 02:39:42.66
that we live here so thanks to all of you for what you're doing and to both your families

2449
02:39:42.66 --> 02:39:53.06
that are supporting that are sacrificing thanks to your families as well and to everyone else out there

2450
02:39:53.06 --> 02:40:02.66
life is a war right it is a war that's what it is at least at a minimum it's a metaphor for war

2451
02:40:03.86 --> 02:40:11.62
it's a fight and there are people out there and there are things out there that are trying to take

2452
02:40:11.62 --> 02:40:18.98
you down there is friction and there are obstacles and there is complacency

2453
02:40:20.98 --> 02:40:25.22
and you might think when I say life's war you like well not really but check this out listen to me

2454
02:40:26.26 --> 02:40:33.46
in this situation that you're in your life is at stake your life is actually at stake right now

2455
02:40:33.46 --> 02:40:42.02
what you do with your life is at stake you are fighting for your life every day the way that you

2456
02:40:42.02 --> 02:40:47.30
live it the mark that you're going to leave the legacy that you're going to leave the people

2457
02:40:47.30 --> 02:40:56.34
that you help the people that you help people that you can help move forward the people that are

2458
02:40:56.34 --> 02:41:03.78
weak that you can make stronger all that is going to come back to you that is your life and your

2459
02:41:03.78 --> 02:41:13.54
life is at stake right now every day almost as if you are at war so don't sit back and be on the

2460
02:41:13.54 --> 02:41:21.62
defense and allow life to happen to you don't do that instead go on the offense every day by getting up

2461
02:41:21.62 --> 02:41:34.90
and getting after it and until next time this is Dave Burke and Jocco out
