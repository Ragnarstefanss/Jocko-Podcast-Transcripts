00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.60 This is jockelpontcast number 284 with echo Charles and me jockel willink good evening echo good evening
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:09.44 Anybody home
00:00:09.60 --> 00:00:15.64 Right from the very threshold of our mungalo reached us a horse voice of an elderly gentleman
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.30 The voice woke us up at high noon of our first day amid the date palms of the settlement outside
00:00:23.30 --> 00:00:26.64 Saddam's palace somewhere at the outskirts of Baghdad
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:32.04 Hi guys this greeting that followed sounded a bit warmer
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:35.60 Our shared English proved to be good enough
00:00:35.68 --> 00:00:43.04 So we were able to freely exchange greetings with our visitor and learn what he wanted from us or rather as it turned out
00:00:43.52 --> 00:00:48.64 What that older fella could do for us in our Iraqi reality
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:54.44 My name is Posi bill posi and I am the boss here
00:00:54.44 --> 00:01:02.12 He introduced himself to us clad in an American uniform pants and a brown t-shirt in case you need anything lads
00:01:02.52 --> 00:01:04.84 Just bring me the list and I'll take care of it
00:01:06.04 --> 00:01:09.16 That was how bill posi greeted us at one time
00:01:09.16 --> 00:01:12.92 He might have been a strapping lad indeed but in spite of age
00:01:12.92 --> 00:01:18.28 He lost nothing of his military appearance and his advanced age only dignified him
00:01:19.24 --> 00:01:23.36 He brought us a box full of batteries in this climate. They run out no time guys
00:01:23.36 --> 00:01:30.28 And you'll generally operate at night each of you must have a large supply them. He explained putting the box on the table
00:01:31.28 --> 00:01:34.16 That is how I remember my first encounter with bill posi
00:01:34.76 --> 00:01:42.44 Our visitor turned out to be one of the oldest if not the oldest navy seals to serve in combat in that legendary US navy unit
00:01:43.28 --> 00:01:48.28 His vast experience and involvement impressed people and he used his age to his advantage
00:01:48.28 --> 00:01:55.24 Bill posis knowledge on military bases how they work like ours and Baghdad seemed unlimited
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.76 Bill posi volunteered with the US navy at a time when most young American males did their best to steer clear of military service
00:02:07.08 --> 00:02:14.76 Some of his civilian friends even faked injuries or famed joint problems fearing fit for duty opinion of the draft board
00:02:14.76 --> 00:02:16.76 Which would have meant an unwanted
00:02:16.76 --> 00:02:18.76 Conscription
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:30.000 But no wonder in the late 1960s in no China was the scene of the brutal Vietnam war and after all not every young guy had a warriors soul
00:02:32.64 --> 00:02:43.04 During his service in the UDT underwater demolition teams in Vietnam posi with other UDT men and seals took part in many combat missions in patrols
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:48.24 In later time he also secured the landing of Apollo 12
00:02:49.04 --> 00:02:56.92 But when he volunteered to the first Gulf war 1990 the medical board rejected him saying he was too old for further duty
00:02:58.64 --> 00:03:00.64 However in 2003
00:03:00.64 --> 00:03:02.64 He deployed the Baghdad
00:03:02.64 --> 00:03:09.24 He built the camp infrastructure from scratch to care of our supplies and he was also an expert on our vehicles
00:03:09.24 --> 00:03:15.52 And he was a very generous man. He raised money on the base for a Catholic orphanage in Baghdad
00:03:15.72 --> 00:03:22.76 But he also remained a warrior until the last days of his service including taking part in combat operations
00:03:23.92 --> 00:03:28.44 The guy was devoted to the fight and to his teammates throughout his entire career
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.20 No wonder
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:35.42 Then that our base in Baghdad was named after him camp posi
00:03:35.42 --> 00:03:43.06 Camp Jenny posi to be exact bill posi had a daughter who is also in the service but in the army
00:03:43.58 --> 00:03:48.14 He said that since the commanding officer desired to name the base camp posi after him
00:03:48.14 --> 00:03:52.62 He humbly let it be named and honor not of him but of his daughter
00:03:53.34 --> 00:03:58.26 Hence the full name of our base was camp Jenny posi
00:03:58.26 --> 00:04:08.30 And that right there was an excerpt from a book which is actually called camp posi written by
00:04:09.18 --> 00:04:14.34 Polish special operations soldier from the grom named Naval Polska and
00:04:15.94 --> 00:04:20.18 This part of the book about the Polish special operations unit
00:04:20.90 --> 00:04:25.38 Working with seals in Iraq. This is the book that I talked about when I had my brother Tom
00:04:25.38 --> 00:04:32.90 Drogo Zaron on here for podcast 276 and that book by Naval Polska is called
00:04:33.42 --> 00:04:42.46 Camp posi and as you heard camp Jenny posi was named after the daughter of the Vietnam era frogman warn officer bill posi
00:04:43.30 --> 00:04:45.30 Who fought in Vietnam
00:04:45.30 --> 00:04:54.74 recovered the Apollo 12 space capsule and who ultimately built camp Jenny posi in Baghdad and did combat operations with the seals and
00:04:54.74 --> 00:04:56.74 The grom and Iraq
00:04:57.94 --> 00:05:02.06 And we are lucky enough to have this legend here with us tonight
00:05:02.78 --> 00:05:11.14 UDT seal team Vietnam Iraq frogman and legend warn officer bill posi he's here
00:05:12.42 --> 00:05:19.14 warrant bill thanks for coming on commandor. It's always great being here. I thought you were gonna call me jacco
00:05:19.14 --> 00:05:21.54 And now you're calling me command. I guess I wasn't supposed to call you warrant
00:05:21.54 --> 00:05:27.70 You know old habits die a very slowly and at
00:05:28.50 --> 00:05:31.14 Group one where I was at a lot of the time
00:05:31.46 --> 00:05:37.58 We really respected you and your ability to lead and your ability to push things through so
00:05:38.50 --> 00:05:41.30 You were a legend at group one
00:05:41.78 --> 00:05:45.02 Not bill posi. I was only a legend in my own mind
00:05:46.26 --> 00:05:49.62 Well sometimes I got trouble for pushing through but it was okay
00:05:49.62 --> 00:05:51.62 So
00:05:51.62 --> 00:05:57.58 Let's start at the beginning. I mean, this is a pretty awesome story for you to spend so much time in the teams and so much time
00:05:57.58 --> 00:06:00.30 Just keeping that keeping the brotherhood on the path
00:06:01.02 --> 00:06:06.90 But it started you grew up in in California, right? Yes, what was the situation there?
00:06:08.10 --> 00:06:09.10 You know it
00:06:09.10 --> 00:06:14.26 When I grew up it was after World War II. We were the first part of the baby boom
00:06:14.26 --> 00:06:21.02 So it was really nothing but optimism especially in southern California because there was nothing here
00:06:21.14 --> 00:06:24.58 There was hardly any people especially in the Los Angeles area
00:06:24.58 --> 00:06:29.38 So everything just blew out of the ground and it was an amazing place to be there
00:06:29.38 --> 00:06:35.14 You know we could surf the freeways went in so some days we could surf in the morning and
00:06:35.46 --> 00:06:42.58 Then get a afternoon lift ticket up at Big Bear and ski in the afternoon. How can you beat that live in the dream?
00:06:42.58 --> 00:06:47.38 Yeah, you could surf you could ski they had beautiful women. I mean what more does a man want?
00:06:48.34 --> 00:06:50.34 It is the place
00:06:50.34 --> 00:06:53.46 My kid my son as soon as he got his driver's license
00:06:53.46 --> 00:06:59.06 He was on that mission and it's a lot easier now even though the traffic's worst guess what they got night skiing up there
00:06:59.06 --> 00:07:03.90 There you go. So he's like oh surfing in the morning go and night skiing at night on the same plan
00:07:04.74 --> 00:07:10.10 What so you you mentioned the baby boomer so what about your your dad was your dad in the military?
00:07:10.10 --> 00:07:14.02 Yeah, my dad was in the Navy he came from Victoria Texas
00:07:14.50 --> 00:07:22.94 Too long beach and he was on a ship called the USS Cummings and he was stationed out of Long Beach and then did the South Pacific
00:07:22.94 --> 00:07:25.46 He met my mother in Southern California
00:07:25.46 --> 00:07:31.22 He took my mother after your married her to Victoria Texas and said this is where I want to go and she says no
00:07:31.22 --> 00:07:35.98 We're not going to Victoria Texas. We're staying in Southern California. No air conditioning at that
00:07:35.98 --> 00:07:38.48 So it was rough total game chair. Yes, sir
00:07:38.48 --> 00:07:47.52 So when what was your dad's war experience like on the USS Coss he was a gunner on the deck of the ships and he was a bocins mate
00:07:47.52 --> 00:07:52.64 So that's what he did and he was in a couple of big battles there and they didn't sink him
00:07:52.64 --> 00:07:53.92 So that's good
00:07:53.92 --> 00:08:01.24 So he had a very positive and my mother also who worked for the Navy had a very positive
00:08:01.92 --> 00:08:04.60 Idea of the Navy and that kind of blood over to me
00:08:04.60 --> 00:08:10.92 Mm-hmm, so and then what what did your dad do after the Navy could did did he get out after the war?
00:08:10.92 --> 00:08:15.20 Yes, sir got out after the war immediately went to work for the telephone company for 40 years
00:08:16.28 --> 00:08:20.80 Well, it was alignment or what was yeah in there guy that climbs the poles just getting it in life
00:08:22.04 --> 00:08:28.12 So he was a very good guy and a very hard worker really a hardworking guy
00:08:28.12 --> 00:08:38.12 So I tried to be as much as like him as possible the week before he died is 82 years old and he was climbing a ladder on a second story
00:08:38.12 --> 00:08:43.54 Painting the ease of my daughter's house, so I'm an 82. That's pretty good. Yeah
00:08:44.80 --> 00:08:48.76 Not no so down. I guess we know where you got your genetics from
00:08:50.28 --> 00:08:52.28 So then you're growing up and
00:08:52.28 --> 00:08:57.60 And this is like just prime kind of prime America
00:08:57.60 --> 00:09:03.000 Yes, and Southern California you got you got surfing where you going surfing that?
00:09:03.72 --> 00:09:07.44 You know, we did it all up and down the coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego
00:09:07.96 --> 00:09:14.44 Because it was easy to do and gas was like 29 cents a gallon so we could do whatever we want to just leave earlier than morning
00:09:14.44 --> 00:09:16.44 And there was hardly any crowds
00:09:16.44 --> 00:09:23.56 Especially well be what really changed surfing was the type of material they used in surfboards
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:29.12 And so originally they used in epoxy well originally was balsa wood, but that was before my time
00:09:29.12 --> 00:09:37.74 But when foam came out they had the foam but it was a polyester foam and if you wanted to resin it
00:09:37.74 --> 00:09:43.64 You would have to either put tar or paper over the rest over the surfboard blank
00:09:43.64 --> 00:09:47.56 So it was very difficult to do and you always had voids where the
00:09:48.20 --> 00:09:50.20 resin went down into the
00:09:50.68 --> 00:09:58.04 Surfboard material and you had a void so when the poly you're a thing came out that revolutionized the sport game change
00:09:58.04 --> 00:10:04.88 Yeah, it was easy to do much stronger much lighter. It was it changed the sport of surfing
00:10:04.88 --> 00:10:08.60 So what years were you in high school? What what year did you graduate from high school?
00:10:08.60 --> 00:10:15.16 65 61 through 65 and so you're going to high school and I mean Vietnam hadn't started yet until
00:10:15.16 --> 00:10:18.16 It just barely probably just started here about it in 65
00:10:18.16 --> 00:10:25.60 Yeah, no it was going okay then and everybody thought well we can kind of tiptoe around it and do other things
00:10:25.60 --> 00:10:33.52 To avoid the work is nobody wanted to to go because you know with the draft was on and it was a different type of military
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:39.64 So typically if you were drafted you were drafted in the army very few people into the Marine Corps
00:10:39.64 --> 00:10:41.64 None of the Navy or the Air Force
00:10:41.64 --> 00:10:47.000 So you would go into the army you would go to Vietnam and you would come back in a plastic bag
00:10:47.28 --> 00:10:54.16 So it wasn't a good deal, you know, they just didn't think it through and it wasn't a good deal for drafties
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:56.72 So when you're going to high school
00:10:56.72 --> 00:11:00.28 Were you thinking about the military as you're going to high school? No, not at all
00:11:00.28 --> 00:11:02.88 We're thinking about how we can avoid the military
00:11:04.60 --> 00:11:09.000 It was a negative sense rather than positive and you were kind of like a motorhead, right?
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.12 Yeah, I always turned to wrench from the time I was a little kid
00:11:13.12 --> 00:11:16.40 I was always building cars or building different things
00:11:16.40 --> 00:11:18.40 So I was really happy in that world
00:11:18.40 --> 00:11:21.92 So give us I mean give us the highlights what was the what was the prize?
00:11:21.92 --> 00:11:23.92 Because what was the board of beauties?
00:11:23.92 --> 00:11:34.20 Well, I had a low budget low-digit car at a 55 Chevy with a 31 Ford front end on it to the axle and everything
00:11:34.60 --> 00:11:41.22 With a 348 and a Muncie four speed so I thought I was a cat's meow on
00:11:41.72 --> 00:11:46.16 Tweety Boulevard. We had this street called Tweety Boulevard where everybody crueced, right?
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:48.72 and it was the longest dead end
00:11:48.72 --> 00:11:56.40 Street in the world and everybody would cruise on it and you know you see all your girlfriends and you know
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:00.80 It was really good. I mean it was like I don't know what that movie was with Ron Howard
00:12:00.80 --> 00:12:03.44 But I mean it was much more
00:12:04.56 --> 00:12:06.56 fun was it diner? No
00:12:07.60 --> 00:12:13.56 God I can't remember that movie with Ron Howard. I know the one you're talking about it was in the 50s and it really looked good
00:12:13.56 --> 00:12:21.76 And movies but the 50s were really better than that because that was the optimism of the 40s and the 50s that America can do it all
00:12:22.08 --> 00:12:27.92 We can do it scientifically and our lives will be forever better and they'll never be a downtime
00:12:28.24 --> 00:12:31.64 Because my father was a depression era kid, right?
00:12:31.64 --> 00:12:38.36 And they had completely different values than we had in the 50s because we thought there was no end
00:12:38.36 --> 00:12:46.64 I mean we could do what everyone nobody in my family extended family in Texas and in California had ever been to college
00:12:47.04 --> 00:12:53.32 Nobody so I tell my father when I graduate from high school. He says well, I want you to go to work for the telephone company
00:12:53.32 --> 00:12:56.72 It's a great job and you can work the job for 40 years, right?
00:12:56.72 --> 00:12:57.72 It's a dad
00:12:57.72 --> 00:13:02.84 I'm not I'm not gonna be hanging for some to a telephone pole and south central Los Angeles
00:13:02.84 --> 00:13:08.68 That was especially because he could get so much overdone and I said I'm not doing that he says you know
00:13:08.68 --> 00:13:12.12 You're really not very bright. I don't think you're gonna make it in the college
00:13:12.12 --> 00:13:15.72 Well he was right there, but you know, what can you say?
00:13:15.72 --> 00:13:18.08 Did you play any sports or anything in high school?
00:13:18.08 --> 00:13:24.98 Yeah, I did the good seal team sports. I played water polo, swam and did cross country and
00:13:25.64 --> 00:13:29.88 track so it was real good. It was really kind of prophetic
00:13:29.88 --> 00:13:36.20 Doing no sports and being able to do you know seal team or UDT at the time
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:43.76 We're what kind of music were you listening to you know typical Southern California Beach boy Jan and Dean
00:13:45.48 --> 00:13:51.32 I you know I tell I'm a school teacher now and the kids have a lot of problems now
00:13:51.32 --> 00:13:54.52 I mean they have a lot of interpersonal problems, right?
00:13:54.52 --> 00:14:03.16 And I tell them about my experience and they look at me. Wow. I mean it was the greatest in my opinion the greatest time ever to be alive
00:14:03.88 --> 00:14:07.40 Well, did we since you work with kids now like what's the difference?
00:14:09.80 --> 00:14:15.48 Hmm, I mean I was thinking from from you're talking about cars, right? Yes, and when you have cars like a
00:14:16.12 --> 00:14:19.56 1955 car. That's a car that any well
00:14:19.56 --> 00:14:26.36 Most people can look at and fully understand what's absolutely you don't have there's no magic to it's right and now
00:14:26.60 --> 00:14:29.96 You open up the hood of a new car just like your point in the book
00:14:30.60 --> 00:14:37.02 If you make it simple everybody understands yeah, and it seems like the cars back then if there was a problem with it
00:14:37.02 --> 00:14:42.76 You could pretty easily identify what the problem was and be like oh, it's a carburetor or whatever and we just get that thing fixed
00:14:42.92 --> 00:14:47.000 But now it's hard to even tell there's so many complications inside of a car
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.12 That it seems like kids these days also are faced with all these different complications as opposed to hey
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.28 You know, this is what we're gonna go surfing and then we got a big bear when we go skiing that sounds like a kind of thing
00:15:00.28 --> 00:15:05.80 You wanted to deal with as a kid right now they're dealing with social media peer pressure and all this other crap
00:15:05.80 --> 00:15:07.48 Yeah, it's a much harder life
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:14.60 It's much more difficult and I see a lot of these kids in my line of work being really stressed out by other kids
00:15:14.60 --> 00:15:21.40 Especially the girl on girl situation where one's chidied or bullying the others, you know
00:15:21.40 --> 00:15:25.72 And the beauty of it is and I don't know if you experience this in your high school
00:15:26.12 --> 00:15:31.48 But the beauty of it is if we were mad at somebody we go out in a parking lot and do it out
00:15:31.48 --> 00:15:35.08 Not that I was a big fighter because I was as big as round as a pencil, you know
00:15:35.32 --> 00:15:41.28 But I mean but that's hot, you know that fight that fist fight in the parking lot and I don't want my kids
00:15:41.28 --> 00:15:43.44 It's cool fist fighting because I'd get fired
00:15:43.44 --> 00:15:47.52 But that that little fight in the parking lot really earned
00:15:48.48 --> 00:15:56.08 Respect from your peers and a touch you hey, I can't be badmouth in these guys because he's gonna suck her punch me and
00:15:56.80 --> 00:15:59.44 Straighten me out so but they don't have that now
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:04.52 You know and I've been that my high school for eight years and I've never seen one fight
00:16:05.16 --> 00:16:07.40 Wow, it's just a different mindset
00:16:07.40 --> 00:16:13.40 I'm sure your high school was your a fighter to others fights and and not to mention you get into a sea
00:16:13.40 --> 00:16:16.36 Opotune here's like a fight every 14 minutes
00:16:16.36 --> 00:16:19.82 You need or not. Yeah, someone's getting hit someone's getting choked
00:16:21.32 --> 00:16:23.32 Palm hold that's just the way it is
00:16:25.96 --> 00:16:32.52 So you you grow up there in Southern California kind of just straight up living the dream. Yes, sir
00:16:33.12 --> 00:16:39.72 Sounds outstanding and I got a job when I was 15 and a half in a grocery store and everything was unionized in
00:16:39.72 --> 00:16:44.48 So I started at 90 cents an hour which was big money for a 15 year old kid
00:16:44.68 --> 00:16:46.68 So I was able
00:16:46.68 --> 00:16:49.84 Some weeks when I was a senior in high school
00:16:49.84 --> 00:16:54.24 I made more and my father who had been at his job for 20 years, right?
00:16:54.24 --> 00:16:58.20 And so I could buy so many car parts and there's unbelievable
00:16:58.68 --> 00:17:01.64 Never saved a dime was I was I smart
00:17:02.84 --> 00:17:06.96 I'd have saved 10% of that I'd have been living in San Diego right now
00:17:06.96 --> 00:17:10.40 So you so you
00:17:11.40 --> 00:17:16.40 As you're getting ready to graduate you know you're not going to college. No, I went to college for two years. You did. Yeah, okay
00:17:16.40 --> 00:17:21.52 I went to college and college was very difficult then because everybody was trying to cheat the draft
00:17:21.88 --> 00:17:26.28 So classes didn't have 25 people in it. They had 50
00:17:26.36 --> 00:17:29.80 You know and you would beg the instructor to take you into the class
00:17:30.40 --> 00:17:33.76 Because if not if you went below 12 units and you're open
00:17:33.76 --> 00:17:40.52 Fauder for the draft so I always tried to take 15 or 18 units just in case I had to back out
00:17:40.80 --> 00:17:45.68 So I went to college because I wanted to be 21 when I went to service so I could drink legally
00:17:46.08 --> 00:17:50.04 Right, so that was my goal to be 21 and to be in the service
00:17:51.68 --> 00:17:54.80 I thought the drinking age was 18 back there. No, not in California
00:17:55.80 --> 00:18:01.96 Not in California and Texas it was but not in California when I joined the Navy in the drinking age was 21
00:18:01.96 --> 00:18:06.80 But at the E club on any B corn auto you could drink at 18
00:18:07.44 --> 00:18:10.72 But you couldn't drink at the trade wins the team bar
00:18:10.72 --> 00:18:14.44 You couldn't go the team bar, right? So you couldn't go a seal team
00:18:14.44 --> 00:18:17.08 You're thinking way more strategic
00:18:18.52 --> 00:18:20.52 Strategic bigger come on
00:18:21.08 --> 00:18:24.84 So you get done with so now it's so you graduate high school 1965
00:18:25.36 --> 00:18:27.96 You go to two year. What college you go to? Compton and
00:18:27.96 --> 00:18:32.12 And and you're studying what are you studying anything you auto mechanics?
00:18:32.12 --> 00:18:36.000 Oh, so you're just getting into it. Yeah. I'm trying to perfect my
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:41.84 My ability to fix things. Are you racing cars? Yeah. Well, I mean just street racing
00:18:42.44 --> 00:18:44.44 illegal street racing
00:18:46.84 --> 00:18:50.92 And what car are you driving now did you graduate from the 50s? Oh no no
00:18:50.92 --> 00:18:56.96 The 55 Chevy took a lot of different engines and different drive train setups and stuff like that so it was good for me
00:18:56.96 --> 00:19:01.44 And then at what point did you start thinking all right? I'm not gonna be able to was it?
00:19:01.44 --> 00:19:07.48 Did you make it the 21 before you got before you joined the Navy? So you made it the 21? No in 1966
00:19:07.48 --> 00:19:11.64 I joined the Navy because the draft was closing in as they needed more men
00:19:12.44 --> 00:19:14.44 You had different steps
00:19:14.44 --> 00:19:21.76 So if you had if you were married then you avoided the draft if even if you were going to school
00:19:21.76 --> 00:19:24.12 But you weren't willing to make that kind of no no no no no
00:19:24.12 --> 00:19:30.32 You weren't that let's get it right? I mean that yeah, you weren't willing to go that distance
00:19:30.32 --> 00:19:34.16 You know when the women in Southern California at that time were incredible and
00:19:36.04 --> 00:19:39.44 You grew up where the women always took the pill
00:19:39.44 --> 00:19:43.24 Well, that's not true because the pill came out in the early 60s
00:19:43.24 --> 00:19:45.24 But nobody took it for a while
00:19:45.24 --> 00:19:50.96 So when the pill came about it was a whole new different social scene and
00:19:50.96 --> 00:19:59.20 And you know everybody got their jihad on if you know what I mean and so it was very fruitful to be a
00:20:00.20 --> 00:20:04.44 Young man and a young woman in Southern California in 1965
00:20:04.88 --> 00:20:08.32 And so if you're so you're getting your your geohad on yeah
00:20:09.12 --> 00:20:13.72 And then so what I want I want point are you did you say you joined the Navy?
00:20:13.96 --> 00:20:17.96 Yeah, we joined a in 1966 a draft was closing in and
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:22.92 Everybody had tried to get into a national guard unit or a reserve unit
00:20:23.44 --> 00:20:28.48 So there was nothing left because everybody of draft eligibility did that
00:20:28.92 --> 00:20:36.28 So I went into the summary were summary and reserves which was a least desirable of any reserves right because you had to go into summary
00:20:36.28 --> 00:20:40.76 And so I did that and that proved
00:20:41.40 --> 00:20:45.56 My gateway to go into seal team. I'm gonna tell you the little story if you went my commander
00:20:45.56 --> 00:20:49.24 So I'm on this ship and I'm turning to rich right?
00:20:49.24 --> 00:20:52.52 I wanted to be in the engine room because I wanted to see how those you know
00:20:52.52 --> 00:20:54.52 Diesel motor was probably
00:20:55.52 --> 00:21:01.24 15 feet long and it was a real good learning experience because I learned a lot of things about diesel
00:21:01.72 --> 00:21:07.76 But the problem is you couldn't take a shower in the summary because there was no in the showers
00:21:07.76 --> 00:21:10.32 They had potatoes because there was no room
00:21:10.32 --> 00:21:15.68 We had about 85 people on the summary and there was no room for anything including the shower
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:20.52 So you were out to see for two weeks at a time and as an engineman you were really greasy
00:21:20.52 --> 00:21:25.04 And you could wash yourself, but you couldn't really get yourself clean
00:21:26.40 --> 00:21:28.40 So
00:21:28.40 --> 00:21:31.68 You get in your rack and you put your face on your pillow and
00:21:32.32 --> 00:21:38.24 You know you wake up in four hours for your next gig and your face is so greasy that
00:21:38.24 --> 00:21:41.20 You're your face slit off the pillow, right?
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:45.44 And I didn't like to be greasy. I didn't mind muddy or dirty, but greasy
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.24 It's it's not good. You know and you had pimples on your face and this is the worst part
00:21:50.64 --> 00:21:56.56 So we used to go to a bar down here in San Diego. I can't remember the name of the the the boat bar and
00:21:57.76 --> 00:22:02.16 You'd walk in and people would smell you before they would see you because
00:22:02.88 --> 00:22:07.40 It was a snorkel summary where the the boat snorkeled
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:12.92 To recharge the batteries and it permeated everything with desophiel
00:22:12.92 --> 00:22:15.16 So you smell like desophiel so
00:22:15.80 --> 00:22:20.12 People would you walk in a bar people would sniff say oh my god
00:22:20.12 --> 00:22:23.64 Where did this guy come from? I mean you're perfectly clean. I mean your skin's clean
00:22:23.80 --> 00:22:26.04 But you just stink like desophiel, right?
00:22:26.92 --> 00:22:28.92 So after
00:22:28.92 --> 00:22:32.92 You know a little while on that summary and I went to the cob the chief of the boat and I said cop
00:22:33.56 --> 00:22:34.84 You know
00:22:34.84 --> 00:22:38.68 I'm I'm really not a quitter this of all on tear service and the summary
00:22:38.68 --> 00:22:41.24 I want to go to the army
00:22:41.24 --> 00:22:46.28 The army's good because I can sit in the mud and the mud you wash off and you don't stink, right?
00:22:46.68 --> 00:22:52.52 So you're in there you're in the navy reserves at this point, but are you what I'm active
00:22:52.52 --> 00:22:55.24 But you're active after duties. So join the reserves
00:22:55.72 --> 00:22:58.20 You go through boot camp, but you're active
00:22:58.20 --> 00:23:02.04 You're active duty sir. You you don't have any brick you're straight up
00:23:02.04 --> 00:23:07.48 When you joined you joined no you you had as long as you wanted to kind of fake it in the reserves
00:23:07.48 --> 00:23:09.08 But usually is a two-year gig
00:23:09.08 --> 00:23:14.76 So that's why I joined and then when I was 21 it worked out my time schedule perfectly, right?
00:23:15.24 --> 00:23:19.08 So then then you were activated got it and then you went
00:23:19.64 --> 00:23:22.20 Was submarine boot camp actually different than regular?
00:23:22.20 --> 00:23:25.16 Yeah, yeah boot camp now is up a top hundred point sand
00:23:25.64 --> 00:23:31.96 San Francisco and the Marines would drill you and they tried to instill discipline and it was like a nine weeks
00:23:31.96 --> 00:23:38.52 School because you went to boot camp, but you only learned about summaries because you're a detriment when you go on that
00:23:38.52 --> 00:23:46.36 Diesel summary you know summaries from World War II not nukes, but diesel boats and if you don't if you turn the wrong valve
00:23:46.44 --> 00:23:52.36 It could be the wrong you know it could be all over for the entire summary you got to know what you're doing when you're not
00:23:52.36 --> 00:23:59.88 Summary so we went to that boot camp and then you did you not did you not put to and to together
00:23:59.88 --> 00:24:05.16 Home land and if you want to submarine because I wasn't the sharpest tool to shed, but I knew there's one thing
00:24:05.16 --> 00:24:07.48 I did what got blessed the guys are on submarines
00:24:07.48 --> 00:24:13.48 Absolutely, I look I've spent probably my whole Navy career prize spent a month on a submarine stole maybe a month and a half
00:24:14.76 --> 00:24:19.40 And it doesn't take much to figure out that it's a special it's a different breed of human being that goes on there
00:24:19.40 --> 00:24:23.000 Because you're because you're in a confined space
00:24:23.32 --> 00:24:26.84 You know there's someone that sleeps in your bed when you're not sleeping in your bed
00:24:26.84 --> 00:24:32.12 Rocking yeah, it's called hot rack and echo Charles, so this is the deal echo they only have so many beds
00:24:32.12 --> 00:24:34.36 They have more people than they have beds
00:24:34.84 --> 00:24:40.04 So when it's your turn to go to sleep someone you're share a bed with someone or maybe two people
00:24:40.12 --> 00:24:44.44 So you get to sleep for six hours and then when you get out of bed someone else's getting into your bed
00:24:44.52 --> 00:24:46.12 It's warm
00:24:46.12 --> 00:24:48.76 Right, so this is just it's not normal
00:24:48.76 --> 00:24:51.24 It's not normal. It's not and we
00:24:51.24 --> 00:24:57.56 And then just as greasy as you oh, man not greasy. Yeah, and and everything is confined
00:24:57.88 --> 00:25:01.24 You know and you literally don't see the sun and
00:25:02.36 --> 00:25:06.12 So it's a so I'm just wondering you didn't you didn't think to myself
00:25:06.12 --> 00:25:11.40 You didn't think yourself. Oh, well, I'm gonna be on a freaking aluminum can under the ocean for months of the time
00:25:11.40 --> 00:25:13.40 Maybe that's not the right deal
00:25:13.40 --> 00:25:15.40 But that was just
00:25:15.40 --> 00:25:22.20 You know all my friends most of my friends joined the submarine reserves and so then they went on the submarines
00:25:22.76 --> 00:25:29.64 So that that's just the way it was anything to avoid the army how long did you spend on in the sub-brainservice?
00:25:29.64 --> 00:25:31.64 month and a half
00:25:32.36 --> 00:25:37.88 Not long enough so after a month and a half of smelling like diesel and being stuck underwater
00:25:38.12 --> 00:25:41.88 You went to the chief of the boat right when that's where I cut you off where you were
00:25:41.88 --> 00:25:49.32 We went to him and said, said all right, I'm done. You know, I just I just don't like it and I'm not the right guy to be this
00:25:49.56 --> 00:25:53.000 You know and he said's posing. Do I have this deal for you?
00:25:53.40 --> 00:25:59.56 He says you go down and take this test this afternoon at 12 o'clock and you can be a seal team guy
00:26:00.52 --> 00:26:05.48 And I said well nobody knew because this is 1967
00:26:05.48 --> 00:26:13.08 Nobody knew what it meant right what seal team was and I thought will seal team will they have seals?
00:26:13.08 --> 00:26:15.08 I thought right seals and
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:21.96 I said well does that mean that you train seals and to do tricks for recruiting?
00:26:22.36 --> 00:26:24.12 And he says no explanatory
00:26:24.12 --> 00:26:32.04 So I go over to a part of the base and they put a hard hat out fit on me and the first test was to
00:26:32.04 --> 00:26:39.08 to drop you over the side of the ship and the bay and you walk around on the bottom of the of the bay for a half hour
00:26:39.32 --> 00:26:46.36 to see if you're claustrophobic and so they drop me over to side and they you know
00:26:47.24 --> 00:26:52.28 I walk around for a half hour and a mud you walk through the mud and this is in the old school
00:26:52.28 --> 00:26:57.40 Like what is it the mark eight dive helmet thing? Yeah, you know, yeah, you know
00:26:57.96 --> 00:26:59.96 It was real old school
00:26:59.96 --> 00:27:01.96 Yeah
00:27:01.96 --> 00:27:03.96 And so it was part of the emanation
00:27:05.96 --> 00:27:13.56 With the GM the big ass lead like you saw no mind your eyes and you couldn't you send a shuffle the boots not walk it
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:15.48 So all of the
00:27:15.48 --> 00:27:17.96 Settlement that's been there for 150 years
00:27:18.36 --> 00:27:21.64 I mean you took one step and you couldn't see for the next five minutes, you know
00:27:22.20 --> 00:27:24.20 So they had me walking around
00:27:24.20 --> 00:27:31.56 And what else did they do with you? Oh, then then they pull you up and they I said hey I passed the test
00:27:32.04 --> 00:27:36.84 What do I where do I go what do I do and they said well you have to take the rather test
00:27:37.48 --> 00:27:41.24 And I said oh, okay, and nobody knew what seal team was right
00:27:41.80 --> 00:27:46.52 So I talked to the guy there and he was a dive guy and I said well what seal team he says?
00:27:46.84 --> 00:27:50.20 Man, it's the greatest you go down to San Diego
00:27:50.20 --> 00:27:54.44 You lay on the beach you are a lifeguard from a marine who make
00:27:55.24 --> 00:27:57.24 Marine landings at
00:27:57.24 --> 00:27:59.24 at
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:09.88 Camp Pendleton right and you have a girl under each arm and in each hand you have a bear and the navy buys you bear
00:28:10.84 --> 00:28:12.84 Said really
00:28:12.84 --> 00:28:17.40 The navy buys you bear yeah, and these girls are gorgeous
00:28:17.40 --> 00:28:20.76 They're they're wonderful down in San Diego
00:28:20.76 --> 00:28:24.36 I said man that's the life for me that's what I want to be right
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.20 So you didn't know because there's no internet there's no books
00:28:28.68 --> 00:28:35.80 I think men with green faces with this first book if I'm not mistaken from where were two and I checked that other library and that didn't
00:28:35.80 --> 00:28:37.80 And you didn't know what you got there
00:28:38.36 --> 00:28:42.76 So you just didn't know which was I think a plus
00:28:42.76 --> 00:28:47.000 Hmm, where were you where were you stationed when all this was happening log beach okay?
00:28:47.40 --> 00:28:55.96 So then they transfer me to San Diego and I go to the team area the Friday before training starts and I go there and
00:28:56.36 --> 00:28:59.24 Olivera, I don't know if you ever heard of him he's my
00:28:59.56 --> 00:29:04.52 Proctor and I show up but like four o'clock in the afternoon and he says where you been?
00:29:04.76 --> 00:29:09.80 I said well they just brought me in the bus here. I don't know what to do and he says
00:29:09.80 --> 00:29:12.12 I said what do I do what do you want me to do?
00:29:12.84 --> 00:29:16.28 Do I need a book back because I thought it was a school I didn't know
00:29:17.32 --> 00:29:21.64 And he says no no no you don't need a book back you just show up Monday morning we're gonna take care of you
00:29:22.04 --> 00:29:23.32 Really
00:29:23.32 --> 00:29:29.16 Yeah, so I go over at that time we had three quans at Hudson at the end of
00:29:29.56 --> 00:29:31.56 Coronado at the end of the base and
00:29:32.36 --> 00:29:36.92 I go there and he gets me a rack and so I'm sitting there the weekend and
00:29:36.92 --> 00:29:39.88 And these guys come in and they tell me what's happening
00:29:39.88 --> 00:29:40.84 And they say oh okay
00:29:41.08 --> 00:29:44.28 It is what it is right. I'm not in the army so I'm pretty happy
00:29:44.68 --> 00:29:49.08 So that's how it just all started then it started going down hill Monday morning
00:29:51.24 --> 00:29:55.32 So what was the wake of call like Monday morning so you had no idea not a clue
00:29:55.32 --> 00:29:58.60 You didn't know it's gonna be physical you know nothing about hell week nothing
00:29:58.92 --> 00:30:03.72 You just thought you're going to a Navy school where you're gonna learn about whatever right some ran the
00:30:03.72 --> 00:30:08.80 Emolition and that type of thing diving and it would be nothing where you ran or
00:30:09.48 --> 00:30:14.04 Swam or whatever so what in your mind as you start getting
00:30:14.64 --> 00:30:18.48 Physically and mentally abused at a high level on Monday morning
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:21.44 What made you say okay? Well, I'll just stick with it. Hey, you know
00:30:22.44 --> 00:30:26.36 I've been in that see the motivation is I've been in that summary and
00:30:26.68 --> 00:30:30.98 There was no way in God's greener that I was gonna go back to that summary
00:30:30.98 --> 00:30:36.26 They're gonna have to kill me. I was not going back to that summary. No way
00:30:37.58 --> 00:30:39.58 So how did the training kick off?
00:30:41.06 --> 00:30:48.98 You know it was just physical training and a valuation and they gave us the test the sealed team test and everybody passed it and
00:30:49.38 --> 00:30:56.18 Back then we had eight count burpees in with the you know run floor exercise than the swim
00:30:56.18 --> 00:31:02.82 So but it was you know I was half the man I am now so it was a lot easier
00:31:03.34 --> 00:31:07.14 To pass what class were you in originally
00:31:07.38 --> 00:31:13.06 44 then 45 and then 46 so you got rolled a few times. Yeah. I got months the first time
00:31:13.06 --> 00:31:19.22 What the hell what's that months? It's a disease a childhood disease from the 50s that they have a
00:31:19.50 --> 00:31:24.26 Noculation your kids got the shot right so you didn't get the shot in your randomly got there was no shot then
00:31:24.26 --> 00:31:28.14 God and then the second time I got in cephalitis
00:31:28.94 --> 00:31:35.26 From the bay from the dirty water and then they gave me some drugs and I got over that in about four weeks and a third time
00:31:35.26 --> 00:31:38.10 I was ready to go then I knew what was going on, you know
00:31:38.58 --> 00:31:46.38 So how far did you make it on each of those previous occasions two weeks and then three weeks and then away, you know
00:31:47.78 --> 00:31:49.78 46 I was good
00:31:49.78 --> 00:31:56.10 And did you did you start to understand what the mission was that you were getting yourself into?
00:31:56.10 --> 00:32:00.98 Yeah, because people explained it you know we had extensive training at the trade winds of
00:32:02.66 --> 00:32:08.50 What was happening and how things went down so then you got it you got you understood what's going on
00:32:08.50 --> 00:32:14.66 You know in that time it was much different than it is now because the or the navy controlled everything
00:32:14.66 --> 00:32:21.38 You were a navy asset all funding came from the navy as from not from so calm or being a national
00:32:21.94 --> 00:32:23.94 Asset like in seal team six
00:32:24.18 --> 00:32:30.58 So it's always where the money comes from what you know how they dictate your life and so
00:32:30.82 --> 00:32:37.14 We were like the dog and the manger UDT even seal team because the navy you know
00:32:37.14 --> 00:32:41.06 We were poisoned to the navy if you wanted to make any headway
00:32:41.06 --> 00:32:44.42 You had to be a surface naval officer
00:32:45.14 --> 00:32:47.86 To make any headway because there was we never had an Admiral
00:32:48.34 --> 00:32:51.38 We never had anybody I believe well I think we had a cap
00:32:52.42 --> 00:32:56.58 So it was very difficult for people with the career to do that if you weren't
00:32:56.74 --> 00:32:58.10 Alisten for sir
00:32:58.10 --> 00:33:02.82 So the guys that were your instructors at this time were these guys that had already done tours over in Vietnam
00:33:02.82 --> 00:33:04.42 Because this is what year is this now?
00:33:05.14 --> 00:33:09.30 1968 early 60 oh so you're definitely getting guys that were coming back from Vietnam
00:33:09.30 --> 00:33:12.74 Right and they're telling you what's going on in a big crowd of world war two folks
00:33:13.86 --> 00:33:18.66 That they were still in because the Korean I mean the Korean war was over in
00:33:18.82 --> 00:33:24.42 53 right and world war two was over in 45 so they still had time in their career
00:33:24.98 --> 00:33:29.46 to instruct at at Buds at that time as UDTRA
00:33:30.98 --> 00:33:36.50 So it was a different world what do you remember was did you have any trouble in training in any of the
00:33:36.50 --> 00:33:42.82 Evolutions none not really I had trouble on the last swim that
00:33:43.62 --> 00:33:49.14 Four and a half miles swim at San Clemente and we just barely made it with that a minute
00:33:49.62 --> 00:33:57.06 But you know the current was running really hard and I mean we were really kicking just to make that
00:33:57.06 --> 00:34:00.02 And a couple of guys did make it had to do it again the next day
00:34:00.50 --> 00:34:03.30 So I was really thankful for that big swim
00:34:03.30 --> 00:34:08.34 You know on that evolution to make it but that's the only time I had any trouble
00:34:08.74 --> 00:34:10.74 How big was your class when you started?
00:34:11.38 --> 00:34:20.18 Oh man I don't remember probably 43 or 44 45 maybe 50 people and then we I think we would let down to 17
00:34:21.22 --> 00:34:23.22 So we didn't have that bad of an attrition right
00:34:24.90 --> 00:34:28.50 We had some really great guys in 44 bill
00:34:28.50 --> 00:34:30.50 I don't know if you remember Bill Wildrich
00:34:30.50 --> 00:34:36.02 Great officer. I mean he was really an inspirational guy
00:34:36.58 --> 00:34:37.78 He
00:34:38.18 --> 00:34:43.06 Could have been the poster boy for your book really a great guy
00:34:44.18 --> 00:34:49.22 So he was really good to me for whatever reason so
00:34:51.14 --> 00:34:57.14 One last question about Buds when when you're showing up you don't know anything that's about to take place
00:34:57.14 --> 00:35:03.06 Seems like guys now they know kind of the minute by minute schedule. I was a little bit in between
00:35:03.62 --> 00:35:07.94 We didn't know a lot when I showed up the buds like I'd never heard of pool competency
00:35:07.94 --> 00:35:12.18 Which ends up being a huge thing. I knew that there was a hell week thing somewhere in there
00:35:12.18 --> 00:35:13.78 Where you stayed awake a bunch
00:35:13.94 --> 00:35:16.58 But you just didn't know what was happening
00:35:17.06 --> 00:35:24.18 What do you think you think that's better you think that's oh that's ten times better like one of my goals in life is the
00:35:24.18 --> 00:35:29.06 Navy has been very kind to me just like the Marine Corps has been kind
00:35:29.54 --> 00:35:34.02 You know thank God for the Navy and my life. I'm sure I'd have been in prison otherwise right
00:35:34.74 --> 00:35:37.22 by the grace of God and and so
00:35:38.02 --> 00:35:41.30 I try to tell people especially in small town Texas
00:35:42.10 --> 00:35:48.26 About the advantages of getting out of Texas and getting out of our small town and going see in the world
00:35:48.90 --> 00:35:53.22 So but a lot of them overthinking and they just psyched themselves out
00:35:53.22 --> 00:36:00.66 It's just too bad that they publish as much as they do because it's in my opinion. It's mudditch better when you stand up
00:36:01.70 --> 00:36:06.34 And you just what are we gonna do next? Okay, let's do it. Let's get it on
00:36:07.06 --> 00:36:09.06 You know, let's go
00:36:09.06 --> 00:36:11.70 And so because I don't want to overthink things
00:36:12.34 --> 00:36:14.34 Let's just do it
00:36:14.34 --> 00:36:15.70 Yeah
00:36:15.70 --> 00:36:16.98 Did you
00:36:16.98 --> 00:36:23.70 Was going through hell week do you remember anything special about that for me? I was kind of I was kind of happy about hell week because I wasn't the best athlete
00:36:23.94 --> 00:36:29.14 So a swim and a run we had a time it was gonna be it it was all those were hard for me to pass
00:36:29.14 --> 00:36:34.66 I had to go basically the way I passed all my evolutions was my going as hard as I possibly could
00:36:34.90 --> 00:36:40.58 But I was always nervous you know sometimes I'd be like you were talking about like within a minute of the drop
00:36:40.58 --> 00:36:47.14 Dead time and I you know be going a squad yeah, and we wouldn't you would not allow to wear a watch right so there's no pit so for me
00:36:47.14 --> 00:36:49.14 I failed one run in Buds and
00:36:49.70 --> 00:36:54.58 Because I tried to pace myself. I tried to pace myself and this kind of how I look at life now
00:36:54.58 --> 00:36:58.82 I tried to pace myself a one run and I failed and I was okay and for men on
00:36:58.82 --> 00:37:02.26 I just ran as hard as I freaking possibly could and and that's how I passed
00:37:02.74 --> 00:37:07.94 But the the thought of like actually knowing each little detailed thing that's gonna come to you
00:37:07.94 --> 00:37:13.46 When when it came to hell week I thought there's no time limit. I'll they can't stop
00:37:13.46 --> 00:37:19.38 They all keep going no matter what so I was kind of happy about hell week. It was one of the easier
00:37:19.62 --> 00:37:24.42 Evolutions because there was no time limit you just had to keep going which I was I look
00:37:24.42 --> 00:37:27.46 I might not have been the fastest runner or the fastest swimmer the best the obstacle course
00:37:27.86 --> 00:37:33.46 But I was good at keeping going I could just keep going no matter what right was how like hell week for you any
00:37:34.10 --> 00:37:35.30 any
00:37:35.30 --> 00:37:42.98 Big your recom moment that you discovered anything? No just everybody was very nervous and we had magic things that one class would give the other
00:37:43.38 --> 00:37:48.02 Like we would have a magic shirt that I got down from
00:37:48.66 --> 00:37:53.06 Guy by the name of Gary Croner and he says this has been passed down five times
00:37:53.30 --> 00:38:00.02 It was a wool shirt long sleeve wool shirt that you wore under your jumper and he says if you wear the shirt
00:38:00.02 --> 00:38:02.02 You're gonna pass how it man give that
00:38:02.02 --> 00:38:09.62 I don't care if I cost a hundred dollars. I want that shirt right and then the other thing that saved me is I
00:38:11.06 --> 00:38:16.58 Had illusions or I was delusional on Wednesday night when we had the big paddle from
00:38:17.22 --> 00:38:23.70 the area down to I be or whatever it was and Bill Wilderick are crew chief are
00:38:25.30 --> 00:38:30.42 crew officer was kind enough to let me sleep for 15 minutes in the belly of the boat
00:38:30.42 --> 00:38:34.50 Because I was I was having I mean I was freaking out right
00:38:35.38 --> 00:38:38.82 I was seeing monsters and all kinds of different stuff
00:38:39.06 --> 00:38:45.54 He says pose you laid out on his boat and I've rest the guys paddling nobody can play now so you try to return the favor
00:38:46.74 --> 00:38:52.50 How ever you possibly can the rest those guys you know be the first one out there get the boat ready
00:38:52.82 --> 00:38:57.86 You know pay him back for the nice thing they did for you to allow you to go through hell week
00:38:57.86 --> 00:39:05.94 Yeah, I had some guys that I saw completely elucinating things I had one small hallucination
00:39:05.94 --> 00:39:08.98 But I don't know if it really counts because I knew it was a hallucination
00:39:09.22 --> 00:39:12.42 I was happening I was like oh this is we're out there on that thing
00:39:12.42 --> 00:39:16.18 I think they called around the world we're doing around the world yes and we're paddling
00:39:16.74 --> 00:39:24.50 And I'm we're in the middle lotion and all of a sudden I start seeing traffic lights like stop signs and traffic lights and it's going to red green
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:29.38 And I'm looking I'm like I'm just hallucinating. That's not real. So I don't know does that count?
00:39:29.38 --> 00:39:32.74 What do you think echo Charles does that count? You know it's fake, but it looks real?
00:39:33.86 --> 00:39:37.06 Okay, that was the only hallucinations I had no monsters exactly
00:39:37.94 --> 00:39:44.18 I had one guy that started swearing like language wise and he started swearing he didn't stop for about
00:39:46.18 --> 00:39:49.38 Every word for you swear to everybody we check hey, is everything okay?
00:39:49.94 --> 00:39:50.90 You rocked my
00:39:50.90 --> 00:39:56.50 Like okay bro, hey dude whatever it takes man just just stay in the boat man. It's all good
00:39:56.90 --> 00:40:00.90 But what are you gonna do in the ocean when that happens you have no recourse you can't lay
00:40:00.90 --> 00:40:05.22 I'm on the deck on the sand. I mean what are you gonna do keep patdling yeah
00:40:06.18 --> 00:40:08.18 Pat little mouse
00:40:09.86 --> 00:40:11.86 So at this time so it's 1968
00:40:13.14 --> 00:40:15.14 At this time
00:40:15.54 --> 00:40:19.86 And I was talking to Roger Hayden about this. He said he said that's a hero or mine
00:40:19.86 --> 00:40:25.06 I love that wrong version 100% yes sir. He he said most guys went to
00:40:25.54 --> 00:40:30.98 UD2. Yes, I'm a graduated. Well, there are three UDTs and one seal team. He said occasionally a guy would go straight to
00:40:30.98 --> 00:40:34.58 Seal team but it was very rare. Right most guys were going to UDT
00:40:34.58 --> 00:40:37.30 Expo a lot of people might not know about the UDT
00:40:38.02 --> 00:40:42.02 At that time what was going on with the underwater demolition teams at that time?
00:40:42.66 --> 00:40:48.34 Well on the west coast there was UDT 11 12 and 13 13 was a new team they started
00:40:48.34 --> 00:40:54.26 I believe in 67 and this band I think it was 771 72
00:40:55.30 --> 00:41:01.94 And so the Navy was again our main driver for funding and for Manning for everything
00:41:02.66 --> 00:41:09.30 And so they wanted to keep UDT because of in case of an amphibious landing or other
00:41:09.30 --> 00:41:14.98 Sort of things UDT was useful to them other than that they had no time for you and there was no funding
00:41:14.98 --> 00:41:22.66 So like in our team we had three pickup trucks and we had to go once a day to 30 second street to
00:41:23.38 --> 00:41:25.86 To give them the surf
00:41:27.06 --> 00:41:32.42 Report so we would drive one pickup truck in the morning at 8 o'clock
00:41:32.74 --> 00:41:37.86 Go to 30 second street and come home. That's the only time we'd use that truck because the other two pickup trucks
00:41:37.86 --> 00:41:44.10 We had we're in the team area but they were up on cement blocks because we robbed those for parts to keep this one going
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:49.70 So there was just no no money and so we just kind of made things happen and
00:41:50.58 --> 00:41:55.94 But I think we were better for that because we had I mean when we went to Vietnam
00:41:55.94 --> 00:42:01.30 We had a pair of bag half full because we had no gear there was no reason to have a lot of gear
00:42:01.86 --> 00:42:04.50 Because we didn't have any money
00:42:05.06 --> 00:42:06.26 So
00:42:06.26 --> 00:42:10.34 It really worked out well for me in my naval career because I was able to
00:42:10.34 --> 00:42:15.70 Learn how to trade things with other services and make things happen and
00:42:16.58 --> 00:42:21.06 That really worked out to be very good training for me to support my sailors
00:42:21.62 --> 00:42:27.94 My my goal was always to support my fellow sailors because the Navy wasn't doing it well
00:42:27.94 --> 00:42:29.94 Nobody else was so
00:42:29.94 --> 00:42:34.50 That was important so you got order what what you DT team did you end up? 13
00:42:34.50 --> 00:42:44.34 So it now is it's 1969 now or is it still 68 still 68 so it's 1968 you get your orders to UDT team 13 is there
00:42:45.54 --> 00:42:49.70 You walked down the grinder a little bit knock on a quantum hut is that basic?
00:42:49.70 --> 00:42:56.82 No, it happened there was for it in the old cement people who don't know about seal team don't know about that old
00:42:56.82 --> 00:43:04.82 Sement building it was I don't know if they've tore that down or not they tore everything down okay they tore that down so it was probably
00:43:05.30 --> 00:43:07.30 hundred yards long and probably
00:43:08.50 --> 00:43:10.50 You know a hundred feet
00:43:11.14 --> 00:43:16.98 wide and they we had four teams in that building you know seal team one and then
00:43:17.22 --> 00:43:22.18 11 12 and 13 UDT so everybody had a very limited space and
00:43:22.18 --> 00:43:29.94 It was kind of difficult but one team was always or you know one and a half teams because seal team was always there
00:43:31.38 --> 00:43:37.70 We're always in Vietnam so we had very limited space no resources at all and it was
00:43:38.26 --> 00:43:41.30 It was difficult because of that because there was just no room
00:43:42.10 --> 00:43:44.10 So when you got to UDT 13
00:43:44.98 --> 00:43:46.98 You checked in what they do with you?
00:43:46.98 --> 00:43:48.58 Did you go right into a bulltune?
00:43:48.58 --> 00:43:54.74 No, no, they immediately sent you to school because they were we were deploying and you had to go to
00:43:54.74 --> 00:43:59.14 Searschool you had to go in my case. I went out board of motor school
00:44:00.34 --> 00:44:06.26 To jump school and then it was just timed so the day you graduated from
00:44:06.82 --> 00:44:09.46 Searschool you got on the airplane and went to Vietnam
00:44:12.66 --> 00:44:15.46 Did you get did you wear that old in signal?
00:44:15.46 --> 00:44:23.46 Like the UDT and signal with you go on it? No, no that that wasn't there was no in signal in 68
00:44:24.18 --> 00:44:26.18 That came later and
00:44:26.42 --> 00:44:32.98 The insignia you had as you had like a diver's helmet on this on your uniform right here and that was the only in signal
00:44:32.98 --> 00:44:37.52 You had and then of course UDT 13 on that on that on that on that
00:44:37.52 --> 00:44:40.26 Batch right right now. There was no team batch
00:44:40.82 --> 00:44:44.82 There was nothing I'm gonna tell you a little story you probably heard this many times
00:44:44.82 --> 00:44:46.82 So we get
00:44:48.02 --> 00:44:53.46 The pirate I don't know if you remember who Pete the pirate was I don't know his name, but I don't know
00:44:53.86 --> 00:45:00.72 So he supposedly designed the insignia for seal team right because he was drinking Budweiser one day and
00:45:00.94 --> 00:45:03.70 He'd submitted like 20 designs because they asked for
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:10.26 T-guys and the teams to to do design now. There's a lot of controversy about that so about
00:45:10.26 --> 00:45:17.38 Three months later they walk into the quansit hut and they said okay everybody's got there in signia
00:45:18.50 --> 00:45:22.90 You know and they gave us the they just dropped this bag on the table and they said okay
00:45:22.90 --> 00:45:27.30 Everybody's got one of these if you're an officer you have a gold one if you're an elisted
00:45:27.30 --> 00:45:30.34 You have a silver one we're gonna have an inspection tomorrow morning
00:45:30.74 --> 00:45:31.78 So
00:45:31.78 --> 00:45:33.78 Everybody's
00:45:33.78 --> 00:45:39.46 Bad inspection and so we're out there stand on the grinder some guys got it on the right side
00:45:39.46 --> 00:45:41.62 Some guys got it on the left side. They have it here
00:45:41.62 --> 00:45:43.62 They have it here
00:45:43.62 --> 00:45:46.02 They're thinking about putting it on their dixie cup, right?
00:45:46.42 --> 00:45:48.90 But I mean nobody knew what to do with it, right?
00:45:48.90 --> 00:45:54.74 And so this was the original tried ant original UDT insignia that was different from the seal
00:45:55.06 --> 00:45:59.94 Try and so the UDT insignia this is the one that basically that looks the same but there's no ego that's correct
00:46:01.14 --> 00:46:03.14 And so nobody I mean
00:46:03.54 --> 00:46:07.22 Seal team had their thing going the same morning and everybody did the same thing
00:46:07.22 --> 00:46:12.02 We just didn't know what to do and we did know what it meant and so
00:46:13.22 --> 00:46:15.22 That was it
00:46:15.46 --> 00:46:20.02 What year did that happen? Was that after you got back from Vietnam after we got back from Vietnam
00:46:21.06 --> 00:46:24.58 So so you show up to to your UDT 13
00:46:24.98 --> 00:46:29.14 You you don't get put in the between you just get sent to see your school you get sent to outboard motorschool
00:46:29.14 --> 00:46:32.82 You get sent to jump school there's no one tracking you there's no one saying like hey
00:46:32.82 --> 00:46:36.90 This is what we're getting ready to do well. They're tracking you because as soon as you get back you go to another school
00:46:37.46 --> 00:46:41.38 So they knew when you were coming back and then they would immediately go to another school
00:46:41.54 --> 00:46:48.66 Then you just jump on the airplane but I knew what platoon I was in I knew who my OIC was and all that and were those guys already overseas?
00:46:48.66 --> 00:46:53.30 No, no they were they were they were they're stuck so they're they're definitely you through all these schools right when you got done
00:46:53.30 --> 00:46:58.34 We're schooling did you go through any kind of pre-deployment workup like you know like I did my whole career was like
00:46:58.34 --> 00:47:00.34 Oh, you're getting ready to deploy you get put into a platoon
00:47:00.34 --> 00:47:05.54 You you know you you uh first you do some schooling like you're talking up the pro dev they call it
00:47:05.94 --> 00:47:14.22 Professional developments so you go to a bunch of schools then it's six months of ULT and then it's six months of the advance post that and then you go on to plan it
00:47:14.22 --> 00:47:19.66 No, it was a week in that Danny's doing ULT. That's how that for people
00:47:19.66 --> 00:47:22.70 Do know what Danny says is an old-time team bar on
00:47:22.70 --> 00:47:31.26 The in Coronado and that's that was a so it was really OJT and we had we relied on the guys
00:47:31.70 --> 00:47:41.02 Coming from seal team to UDT because there were so many new people and so many I mean everybody was an E3 right because
00:47:41.02 --> 00:47:44.02 They expanded the teams and
00:47:44.78 --> 00:47:46.38 Same with the boat guys and
00:47:46.38 --> 00:47:53.46 There was no time for training and they just wanted to get you to work because there was 500,000 Americans and Vietnam at the time
00:47:54.06 --> 00:47:58.64 So you had to go over there and take the next teams, you know a place. I mean
00:47:59.16 --> 00:48:05.18 How long was it from when you graduated UDT replacement training to
00:48:06.46 --> 00:48:09.98 Getting to the team how long did you spend there before you went to Vietnam?
00:48:09.98 --> 00:48:15.54 Did you go to Vietnam as a platoon? No as a team as a whole team. Yeah, it's a whole team
00:48:15.54 --> 00:48:18.26 Sir, UDT 13. How many guys were there?
00:48:20.70 --> 00:48:22.70 Total of about
00:48:23.06 --> 00:48:30.26 90 90 to 100 and you're broken up into platoons inside the team just like us of course same basic
00:48:30.90 --> 00:48:32.90 So you all got on a plane
00:48:32.90 --> 00:48:38.000 We got on two planes. We got on two DC sixes and we had chopped
00:48:38.50 --> 00:48:40.50 Hawaii Johnson Island
00:48:40.50 --> 00:48:44.06 You know going over so three-day airplane ride
00:48:44.06 --> 00:48:49.98 Mm-hmm and because we just went from island to island and finally made it to PI which was our main
00:48:50.74 --> 00:48:51.94 Mustering
00:48:51.94 --> 00:48:56.78 base and then we were dispatched to where we were gonna go and from Vietnam from there
00:48:56.78 --> 00:49:01.62 But prior to prior to going on that getting on that plane with the rest of the team did you go to
00:49:01.98 --> 00:49:06.38 Desert warfare training did you go to did you guys train over the beach?
00:49:06.62 --> 00:49:11.82 Did you guys just do hydro-regont hydro recons up at Camp Pendleton like what did you do to get ready?
00:49:11.82 --> 00:49:17.02 Yeah, we did some of that but it was like for for me it was like a month long
00:49:17.26 --> 00:49:21.74 Other guys who had been in a team for a long time got that training because they were there
00:49:21.74 --> 00:49:24.34 I wasn't there and we were short man
00:49:24.74 --> 00:49:27.22 You know because they just built that team
00:49:27.74 --> 00:49:31.58 So they were drawing and the beauty of team 13
00:49:32.38 --> 00:49:35.30 God rest their souls of some of the people who've been in it
00:49:35.30 --> 00:49:40.82 But a lot of times if you wanted to get rid of somebody that was causing a problem you'd send them to 13 right?
00:49:42.70 --> 00:49:45.50 Lucky 13. Yeah, so it was a very
00:49:47.18 --> 00:49:49.18 Esoteric bunch of folks in
00:49:49.90 --> 00:49:52.18 13 a lot of characters, you know what I'm saying?
00:49:52.58 --> 00:49:56.86 So what will tune were you in it at UDT 13? I think I was in Bravo and
00:49:57.46 --> 00:50:00.38 So it worked out good and Paul plums my OAC
00:50:00.38 --> 00:50:06.90 So you get on the plane now you're fine over there. Do you know what your missions are gonna be don't have any idea?
00:50:07.50 --> 00:50:09.50 Don't have a clue
00:50:11.98 --> 00:50:14.98 No idea what you're gonna be doing don't know don't care just
00:50:15.86 --> 00:50:18.62 Give me the gun. Let's go are you have you?
00:50:18.78 --> 00:50:21.58 You know at one point you were trying to avoid the draft
00:50:21.58 --> 00:50:30.18 But now your seems like you're kind of all in let's go get some no but the reason people were avoid in the draft because this army was so pitiful because they were wasting those bodies
00:50:30.46 --> 00:50:37.12 Why go I mean I don't mind dying right cuz I never I never thought I'd last past 29
00:50:37.12 --> 00:50:41.38 I mean I thought if I made it the 30 I'd be an old man. I just had that feeling on my life and
00:50:42.58 --> 00:50:47.66 And so but why waste your life have somebody poor
00:50:47.66 --> 00:50:53.30 All that money to bring you up and just kill you for no reason. I mean why do that?
00:50:53.30 --> 00:50:59.66 But you're in the teams you know the first day I got to the teams we've the first muster in the morning and it money
00:50:59.66 --> 00:51:05.18 I looked at it my right and I looked to my left and it was all a bunch of weirdos like me
00:51:05.18 --> 00:51:08.18 I never fat fit into society
00:51:08.18 --> 00:51:12.94 I wasn't a popular guy or an outgoing guy or a well-spoken guy
00:51:12.94 --> 00:51:14.78 I was kind of you know
00:51:14.78 --> 00:51:24.50 Nobody really wanted me type of guy you know what I'm saying and so I get there and I see in my class of 43 or whatever it was people
00:51:24.50 --> 00:51:29.26 They're all like me. I said man. I found a home. This is my this is my people
00:51:29.26 --> 00:51:33.02 Huh? I mean all about you other weirdos
00:51:35.30 --> 00:51:39.46 It's an hour you're going now you get to Vietnam you have no idea what kind of mission you're gonna be doing
00:51:39.50 --> 00:51:43.98 Well, we knew more or less because we practiced it, you know, especially in training
00:51:43.98 --> 00:51:46.70 Training was built around the mission in
00:51:47.90 --> 00:51:50.70 Vietnam so we did a lot of hydrographery reconnaissance
00:51:50.70 --> 00:51:55.30 We did a lot of petroleum we did a lot of that so we could pick up those skills
00:51:55.82 --> 00:52:04.70 You know, but we were the last class to go into 13 so we didn't have the training that they had before that when they built the team and some of those guys
00:52:04.70 --> 00:52:10.10 I mean they had been to Vietnam like I don't know you wouldn't know tobacco alloo
00:52:10.10 --> 00:52:18.22 This guy was fabulous and he was my mentor and he was just as crazy as a day lock
00:52:18.22 --> 00:52:25.66 But whenever he said something you listened to him because he had been in the Vietnam a number of times and he knew what he was talking about
00:52:25.66 --> 00:52:27.66 So you listened to the voice of authority
00:52:29.06 --> 00:52:35.94 So that's what we all did. Lou said it. We did it. So you're training for hydrographic reconnaissance
00:52:35.94 --> 00:52:37.94 You're training for petroleum
00:52:37.94 --> 00:52:43.18 Yeah, and you're thinking the a patrolling over for direct action
00:52:43.18 --> 00:52:45.18 Absolutely
00:52:45.18 --> 00:52:48.76 So there's there's a decent amount of crossover with what the seal yeah
00:52:48.76 --> 00:52:51.46 Students would do yeah, we were the poor man seals
00:52:51.86 --> 00:52:55.46 So when they didn't have a mission that didn't like you know give it to you D.T
00:52:58.46 --> 00:53:00.46 So you show up in Vietnam
00:53:00.46 --> 00:53:02.46 What where do you initially go?
00:53:02.46 --> 00:53:07.74 Tons and hooke then we got on the oh I can't remember the name of the ship
00:53:07.74 --> 00:53:17.62 It was a destroyer escort and we did a couple of months off. I hydrographic reconnaissance and that was that was really a good thing for us because
00:53:18.90 --> 00:53:27.90 We got to gel as a platoon and everybody learned their place and we saw who the real warriors were and who to talk to and who to listen and
00:53:28.14 --> 00:53:31.90 So that was very good and so like after the mission, you know
00:53:31.90 --> 00:53:33.90 a debrief, Lew would say things
00:53:34.06 --> 00:53:36.22 You know, pose you what the hell's wrong with you?
00:53:36.22 --> 00:53:40.02 What you're standing at the beach party and you're
00:53:40.02 --> 00:53:45.74 Dlawly gagging and not looking around and not at the ready position if the VC come over that burn
00:53:45.74 --> 00:53:48.82 What are you gonna do? You're right. I was you know
00:53:48.82 --> 00:53:54.90 And so he would straighten this out. He was a great mentor to us because he'd been in seal to him and
00:53:56.02 --> 00:53:58.54 Stone alcoholic, but you know
00:53:58.54 --> 00:54:03.50 He would you you listen to what he said. We're seeing your platoon chief. Yes
00:54:04.50 --> 00:54:10.62 And you guys are doing hydrographic reconnaissance are you the lead line and slate hall my yards right
00:54:11.06 --> 00:54:16.26 Lead line and so I'll just explain because nobody knows what a hydrographic reconnaissance
00:54:16.30 --> 00:54:20.62 So you have a beach party of four people and so you have two
00:54:21.50 --> 00:54:26.38 Inzovette and in the center and you have a line that could be at
00:54:26.38 --> 00:54:33.34 At least a thousand yards long and you have it on a big spool and so you take the spool and then
00:54:33.66 --> 00:54:35.90 Every depending on the gradient of the beach
00:54:36.38 --> 00:54:44.66 Every 50 feet or 100 feet you would have somebody swimming this line down the beach and you might go a thousand yards
00:54:44.66 --> 00:54:46.66 you might go you know a click and
00:54:47.94 --> 00:54:53.70 You would take the lead line see how deep it went and write it on your slate
00:54:53.70 --> 00:54:59.58 You know position number one 50 feet position well you never went over 18 feet
00:54:59.58 --> 00:55:04.38 You know that was 18 to zero was what you're looking at in hydrographic
00:55:04.38 --> 00:55:10.54 Consence then you would take all the sleets once you got done with your beach and you'd go back to the ship
00:55:10.54 --> 00:55:13.58 And you'd make a map of that that beach
00:55:13.58 --> 00:55:18.78 So the gradient was at a thousand yards out it was 17 feet
00:55:18.78 --> 00:55:24.02 So if they have to bring the LSTs in or landing craft they knew what was going on
00:55:24.74 --> 00:55:27.38 So it was very interesting and
00:55:28.74 --> 00:55:31.20 Really kind of a lot of fun because you would just be
00:55:31.20 --> 00:55:36.70 Me, you would have your face in the water all day, you know, just kicking and you'd usually do two a day
00:55:36.70 --> 00:55:40.86 You do a thousand yards in the morning and maybe a thousand yards in the afternoon
00:55:41.42 --> 00:55:45.62 So it was a lot of fun. It Vietnam's really a beautiful place
00:55:45.62 --> 00:55:49.94 I mean breathtakingly beautiful and some of the water is just
00:55:50.74 --> 00:55:58.90 Incredibly clear, you know, especially camera on bay just it's a delight to be in I mean it's like being in a resort and getting paid to be at the resort
00:55:58.90 --> 00:56:00.90 Right, this is the promise you got
00:56:02.90 --> 00:56:09.98 We guys doing mostly daytime order or nighttime daytime because you had to see where you sat in the line and
00:56:10.34 --> 00:56:12.34 Keep the line straight so everybody's
00:56:12.34 --> 00:56:17.92 Slate would be correct. Yeah, I did two arg photons
00:56:17.92 --> 00:56:22.38 Yes, back in the day and we did hydrographic reconnaissance led by enslaved
00:56:22.38 --> 00:56:28.70 I remember we did a o-r-e operational readiness exercise before we deployed to Iraq and my
00:56:28.70 --> 00:56:32.26 Platoon drew the straw to get put on the ship
00:56:33.26 --> 00:56:39.26 For the pre-department training exercise and you know, this is we know we know like this is when you're in Iraq
00:56:39.26 --> 00:56:45.30 I'm getting ready to deploy Iraq we know that we're going to take those guys place right and we get put on a ship
00:56:45.30 --> 00:56:51.14 And we get we get this task he comes down and I remember I walked down the platoon space for all the guys
00:56:51.14 --> 00:56:57.28 Or I'm like all right boys get the lead light and slates out. It's on and one guy by the name of Johnny
00:56:57.28 --> 00:57:00.24 I won't say his full name, but he goes, are you kidding me?
00:57:00.42 --> 00:57:05.98 What are we doing? We're gonna do a hydro I said you're gonna hydro I said he said you gotta be kidding me
00:57:05.98 --> 00:57:09.22 We're going to Iraq. There are no freaking hydrogens in Iraq
00:57:09.22 --> 00:57:13.50 471 miles from the ocean. Yeah, he was going totally dots and
00:57:14.14 --> 00:57:19.72 You know what we did we got our lead line and slate out and we went out did a hydrographic reconnaissance with a flutterboard
00:57:19.72 --> 00:57:23.14 I read beach or whatever it was and took that stuff down
00:57:23.14 --> 00:57:27.54 That's that the navy still needed that information for whatever reason
00:57:27.54 --> 00:57:29.94 I think now they're kind of past I think now they have
00:57:29.94 --> 00:57:36.78 Electronically yeah, they can do it with digital imagery and stuff like that, but that's only what 15 or 20 years ago
00:57:36.78 --> 00:57:39.86 That we were still out there with a lead line in a slate
00:57:42.06 --> 00:57:47.70 So that's your first couple months of deployment. You're just getting your hydrographic reconnaissance on right
00:57:47.86 --> 00:57:51.38 Where you what was what position were you the flutterboard man because you were a good swimmer?
00:57:52.10 --> 00:57:56.60 No, I wasn't a good swimmer. I mean I I can swim okay, but I wasn't the best
00:57:56.60 --> 00:58:03.96 My position a lot of times we learned then how to adapt and we had an IBS on board the ship and we put it
00:58:04.28 --> 00:58:10.88 9.9 horsepower motor on the back of that IBS and we pulled the seaside of it
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.48 So the the ocean I mean the land side we could pull that line so much quicker
00:58:16.48 --> 00:58:21.28 Yeah, by doing that and so much more accurately and that's what we did and I was
00:58:21.28 --> 00:58:26.56 Constantly trying to keep that outboard motor running so that worked out well for our whole platoon
00:58:26.56 --> 00:58:30.000 Yeah, that's a hell of a lot easier to do that swim that flutterboard. Yeah
00:58:31.44 --> 00:58:35.88 How so you did that for a couple months you're out there doing these hydrographic reconnaissance and what came after that?
00:58:36.60 --> 00:58:38.60 Then we went into
00:58:38.60 --> 00:58:43.08 the delton we we're off of Antoine. We take swift boats
00:58:44.12 --> 00:58:49.16 off of an LST off of an island in the south of Vietnam and go in and
00:58:49.16 --> 00:58:51.32 And do patrolling and
00:58:51.72 --> 00:58:56.28 That was basically the next four months. We did a lot of patrolling and you know
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:01.40 Try to do some DA and stuff like that, you know, so what one of these operations like?
00:59:02.24 --> 00:59:04.64 You go in you get dropped off by the swift boat
00:59:04.64 --> 00:59:08.32 Well first of all you go in is a lot of very narrow
00:59:08.88 --> 00:59:13.48 Canals a lot of times if you weren't in a river so you would always engage at the beginning
00:59:13.48 --> 00:59:18.80 So you know we're exactly where they were gonna hit you so say okay at the point
00:59:19.52 --> 00:59:21.84 X-rays coming up everybody get behind
00:59:22.18 --> 00:59:24.42 We had a railing and we had
00:59:25.60 --> 00:59:31.16 Armour body armor on the railing, you know and so we would all get behind the body armor on the railing
00:59:31.16 --> 00:59:37.02 And they would open up with an RPG or a claymore or something like that and we would go a mile pass and say
00:59:37.02 --> 00:59:39.04 Oh, that wasn't that bad today, you know
00:59:39.04 --> 00:59:44.40 So you because you were going through channelized areas and you look at the map me like oh yeah, here's the channelized area
00:59:44.40 --> 00:59:50.20 Here's where gonna get us yeah, and so I mean it was very ineffective, but you just kept your head down
00:59:50.20 --> 00:59:51.48 No swift boat guys
00:59:51.48 --> 00:59:57.60 I mean they were always being hit those guys were really brave guys because they had so many casually
00:59:57.60 --> 01:00:03.64 So they were right there, you know with the 50s and the 60s and stuff and letting them have it
01:00:03.64 --> 01:00:09.28 Where we would be hiding behind it with our M16 point it out from the side
01:00:09.44 --> 01:00:13.80 We're okay, we're gonna we're gonna get those Vc today. We never saw
01:00:14.32 --> 01:00:16.32 I'm sure they were on the other canal
01:00:16.72 --> 01:00:19.84 You know with a command that native claymore something, you know
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:25.68 What was the goal of these missions? I think just to
01:00:27.52 --> 01:00:32.60 Go make sure that they didn't take a big foothold whatever sector you were in and
01:00:32.60 --> 01:00:36.46 And we would go to their camp and we would burn the camp down
01:00:36.46 --> 01:00:45.14 You know we get some C4 and light it and put it into the hooches and it would burn down their hooches and we'd go run their pigs off and stuff like that
01:00:45.14 --> 01:00:54.56 And then we would patrol through the jungle. They had drop us off in the jungle and we'd put patrol through the jungle because they weren't expecting us you know at that time
01:00:54.56 --> 01:01:03.20 That was right after Tet so Tet and the United States was very demoralizing because
01:01:04.28 --> 01:01:10.68 Army always said you know we have this we have this sector we have this country we're doing
01:01:11.36 --> 01:01:16.72 Better every day and then Tet happens this massive battle and
01:01:17.84 --> 01:01:23.20 We beat them back of course, but a lot especially the Marines up north really took a beating and
01:01:23.20 --> 01:01:28.44 And after that as far as the people here in America
01:01:28.44 --> 01:01:31.64 I think we're that that was the end of Vietnam
01:01:31.64 --> 01:01:39.24 We knew we were coming back out of Vietnam because they did Tet and then you go overseas and Vietnam
01:01:39.24 --> 01:01:44.12 And the Army didn't want to go up. They would tell us all the time. They would say okay
01:01:44.12 --> 01:01:49.82 You guys can go outside the wire and do your mission or whatever you want to do but don't expect us to come and
01:01:49.82 --> 01:01:55.70 And you know be a QRF because we're probably not coming out to get you or if we do it might be the nice next day
01:01:55.82 --> 01:02:02.56 Right because the war everybody wanted to stay behind the wire because they knew the war was gonna be over and
01:02:02.70 --> 01:02:05.34 They didn't want to be the last man standing
01:02:05.90 --> 01:02:10.38 So it was a different attitude, but we were gun-hough we went hey
01:02:10.66 --> 01:02:19.48 It's rock and roll baby. Let's do it. You know let's go. This is our big chance and so we would go out and our officers were very
01:02:19.48 --> 01:02:24.06 aggressive the men were aggressive and we just could do whatever we wanted to do
01:02:24.56 --> 01:02:28.32 Of course we ran it up the pole so the command knew what we were doing
01:02:28.56 --> 01:02:31.20 But it was really good for us
01:02:31.44 --> 01:02:38.24 Because we could catch the VC they'd be sitting in Lolli Kagan and we'd be walking up to him and they're over there Lolli Kagan
01:02:38.24 --> 01:02:42.80 And then it wouldn't have any idea that we were coming on them. You know nobody was out there
01:02:43.84 --> 01:02:47.48 What position did you walk in patrol? I was rear security
01:02:47.48 --> 01:02:54.58 So I liked that position because a lot of in my estimation and I probably wrong here
01:02:54.58 --> 01:03:00.34 But I was you know I was always cognizant if somebody comes up on you
01:03:00.34 --> 01:03:03.80 They're gonna usually see you before you see them
01:03:03.80 --> 01:03:05.80 So you got to do a good job
01:03:06.36 --> 01:03:12.16 Because it could be devastating them coming right up you know right up on you would most of your patrol
01:03:12.16 --> 01:03:19.16 How many guys would you take out on those standard patrol usually eight to ten?
01:03:19.16 --> 01:03:22.52 Would you guys how many M60s would you carry and would you guys have stoners like they had over in the field?
01:03:22.52 --> 01:03:24.52 No, we were the poor man sealed
01:03:24.52 --> 01:03:26.52 So no stoners
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:30.40 I'm just going to talk about the M16 if you don't mind commander
01:03:32.08 --> 01:03:38.60 You know that we got to Vietnam we used a variety of different weapons here in training in San Diego
01:03:38.60 --> 01:03:45.68 And none I don't remember any M16s that we used here so we get there and they give us the M16
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:51.20 See man, this is so much different from those woodstock very very heavy weapons
01:03:51.20 --> 01:03:59.12 We had you know and they really were good in their brand new ride right out of cosmoly right and so we go on our first
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:05.24 First mission and we get everything we're soaked everything because we're trooper into the jungle and it's raining
01:04:05.24 --> 01:04:12.88 And we have to go through these different low spots or full of water and we get the gun wet and we get in the firefight
01:04:12.88 --> 01:04:20.24 And you have to constantly recharge the weapon because it wouldn't it wouldn't work, you know
01:04:20.24 --> 01:04:24.68 And so we then they had this real thick
01:04:24.68 --> 01:04:31.88 Lubricant that came from the manufacturer of the weapon and they said this is the Lubricant to use to keep your rifle
01:04:31.88 --> 01:04:35.08 But it kind of gummed everything up and so
01:04:35.92 --> 01:04:40.40 You know after about three of these where the thing didn't work I went to the armor
01:04:40.40 --> 01:04:43.76 I said dude you got to give me something to works. I don't care what it is
01:04:43.76 --> 01:04:47.04 You can give me a six gun because it's better than at M16
01:04:47.04 --> 01:04:53.44 I can I can make it work right and so they give me an M3A1 a grease gun, you know little
01:04:54.04 --> 01:04:55.04 tank
01:04:55.04 --> 01:05:00.12 People and tanks and World War II use its cost general motors made these 12 these
01:05:00.12 --> 01:05:06.56 guns for 12 dollars and 87 cents each during World War II right and they gave me that gun
01:05:06.56 --> 01:05:10.76 And only thing you have to do is shake it one time the water out and then that thing would work
01:05:11.40 --> 01:05:17.32 Flawlessly you could come right out of the water bring it up give it a little dip bang bang bang bang
01:05:17.32 --> 01:05:22.76 It was a wonderful weapon. I I carried that a lot because it worked every time
01:05:22.76 --> 01:05:29.48 So I really liked that weapon and it was very negatively buoyant, but it really worked good
01:05:30.20 --> 01:05:34.44 What was your optempo light? I mean how often were you guys going out on these patrols?
01:05:34.44 --> 01:05:37.32 You know sometimes a lot sometimes a little
01:05:37.88 --> 01:05:39.88 depending on what was going on and
01:05:40.20 --> 01:05:42.52 What we had coming down the pipe?
01:05:43.32 --> 01:05:47.12 You know what the navy would task us we were really some a lot of times
01:05:47.56 --> 01:05:50.24 Dependent on the navy to do something with assets
01:05:50.80 --> 01:05:52.30 Swift boats or whatever
01:05:52.30 --> 01:05:56.82 So sometimes would work five days a week sometimes six sometimes two
01:05:58.10 --> 01:06:04.14 So that's gonna lead me to my next point if you don't mind so I like to operate right
01:06:04.42 --> 01:06:08.62 You know and I I like to be busy because I don't like to set around
01:06:08.86 --> 01:06:11.90 So I would volunteer I'd go to Mr. Plum and see Mr. Plum
01:06:11.90 --> 01:06:15.86 You gotta give me a job and I can't sit here in this LST or wear on sea float
01:06:16.02 --> 01:06:21.08 You know we're on sea foes nasty and so he said pose it. I got a deal for you
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:23.08 You're gonna go with the army today fine
01:06:23.44 --> 01:06:28.40 So what we would do I would hook up with a second lieutenant
01:06:28.40 --> 01:06:32.80 I was 21 at the time and he was like 20 right?
01:06:33.20 --> 01:06:37.44 Never been in combat and they give him a patoon of arvon right?
01:06:37.44 --> 01:06:41.52 We had a patoon of 30 arvon which was the Vietnamese national guard
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:48.000 30 Vietnamese who had little battle experience if any and we would go out with them
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.38 We would patrol with these guys and we never lot them let them get behind us
01:06:52.74 --> 01:06:59.16 Never ever let them get behind us because you don't know who's the VC and who's not and you'd get shot in the back
01:06:59.36 --> 01:07:06.04 So I would carry the radio they never let none English-speaking people carry the radio because you had to have somebody
01:07:06.32 --> 01:07:09.02 You know that people could one understand too
01:07:09.30 --> 01:07:12.28 knew that they weren't getting suckered in with some
01:07:12.28 --> 01:07:14.28 Viet Kong on the radio
01:07:14.28 --> 01:07:21.20 So I would carry the radio and the lieutenant would be in front of me and we would be in back of the platoon
01:07:21.20 --> 01:07:24.72 And so I really I like that because
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:30.84 I mean these guys were slow and they had no ability to engage the enemy
01:07:30.84 --> 01:07:36.000 I mean we had 30 guys and if there were six guys engaging us, you know, they were freaking out
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.68 You know and so we would kind of round them up and you know
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:44.10 Well, you're gonna go here and you're gonna go here and you know it was kind of fun and
01:07:46.28 --> 01:07:49.88 One day we were out there with these guys and they all gave them you know
01:07:49.88 --> 01:07:52.32 They knew there was no VC in the vicinity
01:07:52.52 --> 01:07:57.76 So that's the the missions that they would give us because these guys were so terrible
01:07:58.32 --> 01:08:02.32 And so we went out today and we could we saw like these 30 guys
01:08:02.80 --> 01:08:05.12 Give us the evil eye about
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:09.04 You know half a click off over the other side of this rice
01:08:09.04 --> 01:08:13.86 And then I said LT we got to make it back to the the boats because
01:08:14.24 --> 01:08:18.08 These guys got that evil look on us and they're gonna come and get us and he said yeah
01:08:18.72 --> 01:08:22.40 So anyhow we're getting these you know we're telling these feasts
01:08:22.40 --> 01:08:25.92 I mean these are even guys we got to move we got to get back
01:08:25.92 --> 01:08:30.68 Well, they're kind of a lolly gagging along and these feasts are coming right up on us right and
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:33.96 I say the LT we better
01:08:33.96 --> 01:08:37.28 You know, you know we better do something and he said oh you know
01:08:37.28 --> 01:08:43.04 He was good I can't find fault with them at all so we had this this battle line there and
01:08:44.04 --> 01:08:51.08 Heads of area type and things got real bad for us and so I got on a radio and I called
01:08:52.88 --> 01:08:54.88 A net there and I said
01:08:54.88 --> 01:09:01.32 You know to the army guys is there anybody else that can come and help us do you have any healos or anything out there that can help us and
01:09:02.52 --> 01:09:06.44 They said we got no healos, but we do have a fast mover coming in on you guys
01:09:06.44 --> 01:09:11.36 Well, that help you and I said does he have anything on board to kind of light these guys up?
01:09:11.36 --> 01:09:16.16 He said oh yeah, he's equipped with Naepon said really and so
01:09:17.48 --> 01:09:22.000 Through that radio relay, you know we talked to that guy and
01:09:23.04 --> 01:09:25.48 There were they talked to him I talked to them and I said okay
01:09:25.48 --> 01:09:30.48 We're gonna pop the smoke and on the south side of the smoke don't let that Naepon go on us
01:09:30.48 --> 01:09:35.92 You know let it go on those dudes and they did and I'd never been around Naepon
01:09:35.92 --> 01:09:40.20 Close before because you could always see it in the distance but never close and
01:09:40.60 --> 01:09:46.60 Man that it was incredible the power of the Naepon just absolutely incredible in a hot
01:09:46.60 --> 01:09:48.000 We were probably
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.04 100 feet away, you know, hunker down we could we could see him off
01:09:52.60 --> 01:10:01.08 Flying that fan I'm coming in and he dropped that Naepon and it was just like a blast furnace and he lit those guys up and
01:10:01.08 --> 01:10:05.88 And a VC it lit them up and they were still running
01:10:06.60 --> 01:10:11.16 Completely engulfed in flames and and liquefied their gelite
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:17.88 Gasoline and it was really incredible to see that the power of that weapon and so
01:10:18.32 --> 01:10:23.56 Then we obviously as soon as he lit them up we all ran away and went back to the
01:10:24.44 --> 01:10:29.48 Extraction point and so I'm happy that guy was there because I don't know
01:10:29.48 --> 01:10:38.04 It's probably me and the L.T. and the Arvins at that point we let the Arvins been behind us because we had a bit of running full speed of hell through that jungle, right?
01:10:38.04 --> 01:10:40.04 I mean
01:10:40.04 --> 01:10:42.04 It was getting real bad real fast
01:10:43.16 --> 01:10:47.16 How often would you say you came into enemy contact on these operations?
01:10:47.16 --> 01:10:51.76 You know I've got some some Vietnam friends that that weren't in the seal teams sometimes
01:10:51.76 --> 01:10:56.24 They'd say they barely got in any contact with the enemy other guys different deployments
01:10:56.24 --> 01:10:59.76 They got in contact even Roger Hayden from one deployment to the next one time
01:10:59.76 --> 01:11:02.08 He's out there. It's like not too bad the next time. It's crazy
01:11:02.32 --> 01:11:11.08 What was it like for you? No, it wasn't we weren't seals and we knew we weren't seals and we would just go do the missions that the Navy told us to do
01:11:11.24 --> 01:11:14.56 So it wasn't like Ramadi. I mean it was
01:11:15.20 --> 01:11:19.84 We'd have contact as far as claymores and stuff like that going on in swift boats
01:11:19.84 --> 01:11:27.60 But I mean it wasn't at all like what you experienced in your battles. Well, I don't know
01:11:27.60 --> 01:11:33.40 I wasn't getting chased out by VC having to drop an ape on 100 feet away, but we were lucky on that
01:11:33.40 --> 01:11:35.70 You know who are very lucky?
01:11:35.70 --> 01:11:38.50 How were you how was your luck with taking casualties?
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:43.60 For the Arvins? No for for your suit for your UDT
01:11:43.60 --> 01:11:45.60 Well, in my platoon
01:11:45.60 --> 01:11:48.08 I don't think we had one casualty
01:11:48.08 --> 01:11:52.88 And we had a real good OIC Paul plumb. I don't know if you know him
01:11:53.68 --> 01:11:57.64 He was really a good officer and he really looked out for the sailors
01:11:57.96 --> 01:12:03.88 So we were really good with that and he did you know he would see the mission and he would
01:12:05.04 --> 01:12:07.04 Explain the mission and very
01:12:07.84 --> 01:12:16.12 You know most of the guys we were called knuckle draggers, right? And so he had to be simple because you know
01:12:16.12 --> 01:12:20.84 We just didn't have the experience of all the stuff that they have now
01:12:20.84 --> 01:12:28.96 And so he was really good and we got it and so it just wasn't the up tempo of
01:12:29.60 --> 01:12:32.60 Seal team one for UDT and most places
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.60 and
01:12:34.60 --> 01:12:36.12 Then how long were you do it?
01:12:36.12 --> 01:12:41.72 This was all taken place all those missions were taken place those patrol missions were taking place out of the
01:12:41.72 --> 01:12:46.68 The the barge some of the barge some of the swift boat depending if you were an Antoy
01:12:46.68 --> 01:12:51.44 Antoy was an island and you'd go in and the barge was in the middle of the river
01:12:51.80 --> 01:12:56.68 You know and so we would deploy off of that and so you did operations out of both those yes
01:12:56.68 --> 01:12:59.24 And how long were you doing those types of operations?
01:12:59.24 --> 01:13:03.60 Did a couple months worth of hydrographic reconnaissance off of the USS
01:13:04.08 --> 01:13:08.28 Whatever that ship was and then and then now you're doing USS cook
01:13:08.28 --> 01:13:13.76 USS cook and now you're doing these types of patrolling operations and you know swift boat operations
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:16.56 How many months were you doing that for I think around four?
01:13:17.16 --> 01:13:21.44 But you'd every too much you'd have a break and sometimes you'd go back to the PI and
01:13:21.96 --> 01:13:26.76 Recrupe and get new guys or do whatever and then how long was the total deployment?
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:30.80 Six months. Okay, so that was that would pretty much your deployment. Yes, sir
01:13:32.04 --> 01:13:34.44 So you come home from that deployment what year is it?
01:13:35.48 --> 01:13:37.48 69
01:13:37.48 --> 01:13:41.80 Yeah, I think 69 and then what what was the what was the Apollo?
01:13:42.52 --> 01:13:47.000 That's right, so what point did you hear about Apollo? Well when we were getting
01:13:47.88 --> 01:13:53.16 You know nobody wanted to come home at least most of the guys didn't want to come home because
01:13:53.56 --> 01:13:57.40 People didn't like you if you're a New York services if you had a haircut
01:13:58.04 --> 01:14:04.60 Like the most of us in this room they perceived you to be a soldier or a sailor and they didn't like you
01:14:04.60 --> 01:14:07.56 So I didn't want to come home. I volunteered to stay and
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:13.64 Then they said well you can go on Apollo. I said I was a history major also in school
01:14:13.64 --> 01:14:17.72 And I said man this is a time to you know if I can be on Apollo
01:14:18.16 --> 01:14:20.16 Even though it's such a pain
01:14:20.16 --> 01:14:22.16 It was a pain in the ass
01:14:22.88 --> 01:14:27.16 That I should do this so they they one day they announced okay
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:30.16 We're gonna do Apollo 12 and 13 and
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:37.12 Whoever wants to do a common see the exo so nobody saw them the first day and so the second day they make
01:14:37.12 --> 01:14:40.88 Acquotors they said whoever wants to be on Apollo
01:14:41.20 --> 01:14:45.52 Go see the exo because we knew the next day you would be volunteers right?
01:14:46.56 --> 01:14:50.40 And so for Apollo 11 the first one you were in Vietnam when I was happy right?
01:14:50.40 --> 01:14:53.28 We didn't even know how happened because we were out and there was no TV or radio
01:14:53.28 --> 01:15:00.28 But that was the big one everybody wanted to go on that one. I knew a couple guys on that that was really will
01:15:00.28 --> 01:15:01.28 Fremb
01:15:01.28 --> 01:15:03.28 I can't remember his first name
01:15:03.60 --> 01:15:07.60 But he did a really good job on that they had the good guys
01:15:08.40 --> 01:15:14.12 But then once it was over people like I everyone here's what the story is sitting around in the ocean for a while
01:15:14.12 --> 01:15:16.92 Looking up at the sky waiting for these guys to touch it down
01:15:17.44 --> 01:15:22.76 Being on a ship wherever you are so it turned from a good deal to like hey, maybe we don't want to do that
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:26.44 It wasn't a team deal right I mean it wasn't a good deal for the team guys
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.68 So they say so I go to the exo and I said okay, I want to go on Apollo
01:15:31.68 --> 01:15:35.88 But I want to choose my position on the team and he says well what position you want to be?
01:15:36.60 --> 01:15:40.24 And I said I want to be the first man out the door and he says you got it posey
01:15:40.68 --> 01:15:41.96 So
01:15:41.96 --> 01:15:44.52 He was lying to me and I know he was lying to me
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:51.60 I thought I had a shot right because the first man out the team had his name announced
01:15:51.60 --> 01:15:57.32 It was a literally a billion people looking at TV and even on the second one because they thought the second one
01:15:57.32 --> 01:16:01.32 It was going to blow up because it got struck by lightning on the path right and so
01:16:03.32 --> 01:16:07.16 So I said okay, I'm going to be the first guy out the door and he says yeah and so
01:16:07.60 --> 01:16:09.20 Then other people
01:16:09.20 --> 01:16:17.16 Fall in tears and we we did it so it the reason why it was a pain of but is because we did it three times a day morning
01:16:17.16 --> 01:16:24.000 noon and night cover of darkness is because we never knew when the capsule was going to come down for sure or not
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.64 Right and you'd go out and then the first supposed two hours you'd be on scuba on the surface of the water
01:16:33.04 --> 01:16:37.60 Because they thought there were moonbooks. We didn't know if there was decontamination from the moon
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.60 Excuse me and so you'd suck that thing
01:16:42.60 --> 01:16:48.92 I mean I probably sucked that tank dry in 15 minutes, but you had to keep it in your mouth on the side
01:16:49.28 --> 01:16:56.60 to breathe because you know that was the procedure that's when NASA required and so we would be out there and
01:16:57.28 --> 01:17:02.52 Doing this thing and for the first two hours being on the surface like that with that thing in your mouth
01:17:02.84 --> 01:17:06.84 It would make you seasick and so you'd throw up so every
01:17:06.84 --> 01:17:13.000 All the time before the mission I would go eat a bunch of saltine crackers because I didn't like dry even on rather
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000 Heave something that was
01:17:15.48 --> 01:17:22.36 Solid rather than just dry even and so you'd be seasick for maybe a half hour than you'd get over it and you know
01:17:22.36 --> 01:17:27.88 way you went and the process for every minute they had you were supposed to do
01:17:29.08 --> 01:17:32.52 Minute a minute be minute all the way to xxx
01:17:32.52 --> 01:17:39.72 NASA knew what you were supposed to be doing over that four hours and 45 minutes and you had to abide by that
01:17:40.20 --> 01:17:45.000 Schedule to do because if you fell behind they were really mad for whatever reason and
01:17:45.88 --> 01:17:51.56 Our team was really good and I think with one time we held the recovery record on
01:17:52.28 --> 01:17:54.28 Apollo tell for doing the fastest one and
01:17:56.12 --> 01:18:01.28 The problem with it is the guys land in the ocean these three astronauts in this capsule
01:18:01.28 --> 01:18:07.52 It's 12 feet across and probably 10 feet oh not even 10 feet nine feet high right
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:16.32 And they're Bob and there for like an hour on the thing inside of this capsule on their back and they come out and there is green
01:18:16.64 --> 01:18:19.20 I mean, I don't see anything green on this table
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:25.92 They're this color green when they get out of the capsule because they're so seasick because they've been in this capsule with bad air
01:18:25.92 --> 01:18:27.92 And I'm sure all their
01:18:27.92 --> 01:18:34.32 Suge problems and all this stuff and they're green when they come out of it and you want to get them out of that as soon as possible
01:18:34.32 --> 01:18:36.96 So you know to to give them some relief
01:18:37.76 --> 01:18:40.96 So it was a very interesting thing
01:18:42.40 --> 01:18:49.92 That we had a mock up and we practiced on that off of the Hornet that was the aircraft carrier we did that three times a day
01:18:51.12 --> 01:18:57.20 One time we couldn't stop the capsule and the capsule would catch the wind and it would run
01:18:57.20 --> 01:19:02.64 If you got in front of the capsule it would run you over just like a lawnmower right and go over you
01:19:02.64 --> 01:19:06.000 About two knots and you know you can't swim two months. It's impossible
01:19:06.72 --> 01:19:12.24 You know with all the stuff we had to wear it's impossible at two knots and so we couldn't stop this
01:19:12.24 --> 01:19:15.20 So we and our morning exercise we couldn't stop
01:19:15.76 --> 01:19:18.96 So we went back in the afternoon and
01:19:18.96 --> 01:19:26.80 And I said you know if I get if you drop me right on the capsule I think because what the first man out the door
01:19:27.04 --> 01:19:33.04 There was a derring on the side of the capsule and you would hook this hook into the derring and did
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:39.68 Poia perissue to stop the forward and progress of this capsule from running over you and running away
01:19:40.08 --> 01:19:47.44 Couldn't stop so I said drop me right on the capsule and I can stop this thing because we had the other team doing it
01:19:47.44 --> 01:19:53.28 And I was lucky enough to be able to do it. I'm sure the wind wasn't as great as it was in the morning or whatever, you know
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.20 And they said because they were thinking about firing a
01:19:58.48 --> 01:20:07.60 50 caliber into it to sink it because it's a navigation hazard. I mean it's a big piece of iron right and we stopped that and then on the mission day
01:20:08.16 --> 01:20:10.16 The seas from trough to
01:20:10.16 --> 01:20:20.000 Crest of the wave were probably 12 to 15 feet yeah it was really brutal and it was slapping that capsule around like there was no in
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.20 He said one of those guys going through inside of that capsule
01:20:23.84 --> 01:20:29.36 So I jump out of the helicopter that day and they let me put me right next to it right and
01:20:31.28 --> 01:20:38.40 I go and I can't find the deering. I can't find unpanicked, you know what what to my mind commander? What's worse?
01:20:38.40 --> 01:20:44.88 Being somewhere where you're supposed to be competent and you're totally incompetent and you make a fool of yourself
01:20:44.88 --> 01:20:47.12 What's worse in there nothing nothing nothing
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:51.12 You know it's like you know especially with a billion people watching
01:20:51.68 --> 01:20:54.48 That's the one thing that's worth is having a billion people watching be
01:20:54.80 --> 01:20:58.88 In confident when you're supposed to be competent. It's like the bribe grom on the wedding night
01:20:58.88 --> 01:21:04.16 I mean you want to be competent right doing I'm saying yes, yes, you want to be competent
01:21:04.16 --> 01:21:10.88 And so I couldn't find it and I was panicked and I did know they put a piece of foil
01:21:11.60 --> 01:21:18.32 Over because the outer layer of the capsule has foil this gold foil and it's very bright and it's shined in your mask
01:21:18.88 --> 01:21:20.88 And it was very difficult to see
01:21:21.60 --> 01:21:24.64 So I'm going around tapping the sides of the capsule looking for it
01:21:24.64 --> 01:21:32.16 I finally found it and I was able to hook it up and then we went from there and so it went really good for having such high seas
01:21:32.16 --> 01:21:37.68 So the rest of the process and they said whatever you do whatever you do
01:21:38.96 --> 01:21:44.64 You do not go and strip the foil off the capsule because they want to analyze its
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:48.48 Capitals like a fiberglass aircraft aluminum right and
01:21:49.28 --> 01:21:53.68 All over the if they have this gold foil this plastic gold foil
01:21:55.04 --> 01:22:01.20 Do not take any of the foil because we have to analyze a situation when it comes out of the spit out of the out of the
01:22:01.20 --> 01:22:07.92 Air we need to know what's going on so oh no we would never do that right we would never do that
01:22:08.40 --> 01:22:15.28 So we knew at what point the aircraft carrier the aircraft carrier takes four miles to turn around right and
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:21.92 Otherwise they're right on you and they got the big you know the giant binoculars and found that big and they're looking at you
01:22:22.24 --> 01:22:23.76 You know
01:22:23.76 --> 01:22:26.48 You know one of those because the NASA guys always hated us
01:22:27.28 --> 01:22:29.28 Just like everybody else
01:22:29.28 --> 01:22:31.28 And so
01:22:31.28 --> 01:22:36.64 As soon as the aircraft carrier starts making its turn we go on the other side of the capsule we're stripping this foil
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:38.64 And we're sticking in our wed suit
01:22:40.64 --> 01:22:44.64 One for the ground back to one for mom one for the girl
01:22:44.64 --> 01:22:47.60 I had a girlfriend to play the cello and I could never
01:22:48.48 --> 01:22:50.000 Get anywhere with that girl for me
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.36 I said man this is this is gonna bode me well with this girl for an upbeat this thing's been to the mood
01:22:55.36 --> 01:22:58.72 Man she's getting something I give what is that?
01:23:02.24 --> 01:23:06.88 How big was the area that you knew that the capsule was gonna touch down in?
01:23:07.52 --> 01:23:12.40 Well, we anticipated being within four miles so so it was pretty accurate pretty accurate
01:23:12.40 --> 01:23:14.56 But you never know because they had the aircraft
01:23:14.56 --> 01:23:19.44 I mean excuse me the Air Force guys and C130s with the pair of guys
01:23:19.44 --> 01:23:26.40 Being able to jump out if it wasn't within because they knew once it started decelerating
01:23:26.72 --> 01:23:34.24 Coming out of the space because it had to go from 24,500 miles down to you know five miles an hour
01:23:35.04 --> 01:23:42.64 They knew upon a deceleration where it's gonna be so we would steam to that thing and it I mean that that carrier was right there
01:23:42.64 --> 01:23:45.12 I mean we saw it coming right out of the sky
01:23:45.76 --> 01:23:47.76 So that was really that
01:23:47.76 --> 01:23:55.12 Those mathematicians and the sailors really did did well on that yeah, that seems like a big challenge
01:23:55.12 --> 01:24:02.000 No, I think it would be even in four miles free from 25,000 miles an hour through the through the atmosphere
01:24:03.04 --> 01:24:08.40 And then did did so we either first guy out you were the first guy out that did they say your name on absolutely there we go
01:24:08.40 --> 01:24:11.44 And so this is kind of a funny funny thing here
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:16.40 So my mother was really proud of me, you know my son, he's gonna be out of
01:24:16.40 --> 01:24:18.40 Mom nobody wanted to do it
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:21.20 I found her first
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:29.76 You know she said don't tell her neighbors that you are selected as far as mom was concerned went through a rigorous selection program
01:24:30.32 --> 01:24:32.88 They're for you out who had who had what who had the right stuff
01:24:32.88 --> 01:24:39.12 That's right. No, we we drew straws and the low man got to go on Apollo because nobody else
01:24:40.48 --> 01:24:42.48 Do you still have any of the foil? No
01:24:42.48 --> 01:24:44.48 Thank you
01:24:44.88 --> 01:24:51.20 So my mother knew I was gonna be on Apollo and she knew I that my name was gonna be announced right in my city
01:24:51.76 --> 01:24:54.80 So she we didn't have color TV my father
01:24:55.20 --> 01:25:00.32 Didn't like color TV so she says I'm buying a color TV. I'm gonna see my son
01:25:00.88 --> 01:25:03.44 So they had all the neighbors in and all the
01:25:03.44 --> 01:25:12.000 Like we had a group of kids that I went to school college with and they all came over my house and my wife didn't know me
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:19.68 But she came to my mother's house just for that thing and and she says my heart the first time I saw my husband was a half inch tall
01:25:23.44 --> 01:25:25.44 So that was a big deal
01:25:26.88 --> 01:25:29.68 So what happens when you get done with that what what's your next thing?
01:25:29.68 --> 01:25:38.72 You do then I I wanted to go on 13 because I just I was you know we my team was really good at this
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:43.44 Okay, we had some great officers great chiefs great people doing it
01:25:43.44 --> 01:25:46.88 And I wanted to go and I said okay, I want to go they said well
01:25:47.44 --> 01:25:54.16 You're just about done and I said what do you mean I'm done and he says well you got a sign up for another four years
01:25:54.16 --> 01:25:58.56 To go on this and I did four years to go on Apollo
01:25:59.68 --> 01:26:05.60 Because they had the Vietnameseization this was terrible thing and this is what I see going on in Iraq
01:26:05.76 --> 01:26:11.68 They had the Vietnamese Asian of Vietnam so we turned over all of our assets to the Vietnamese
01:26:12.32 --> 01:26:15.60 Especially in the very hot sectors and
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:21.36 We would only go as backup or supportive if they were having a problem, you know
01:26:21.36 --> 01:26:27.44 And so you could see the end of the war coming even in 69 the end of the war was coming because
01:26:27.84 --> 01:26:31.92 These guys were taken over there and completely incompetent and so I said
01:26:32.56 --> 01:26:35.36 Man of this team 13 get a make another deployment
01:26:36.16 --> 01:26:42.48 Probably you know, but what's it gonna be like we're just gonna be sitting you know watching victory at sea movie somewhere
01:26:42.48 --> 01:26:44.48 And not really going out and doing a lot and
01:26:46.24 --> 01:26:50.000 So I just got out I didn't up for that other four years
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000 So
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.40 Did you stay in the reserves was there a reserve at the time?
01:26:55.04 --> 01:26:58.88 The Navy the real Navy reserves so just big Navy reserves
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:05.52 Yeah, big Navy reserve and you want to dive in you or something and then is that what you did you stay in reserves and then
01:27:07.92 --> 01:27:12.48 Admiral Bonelli was instrumental in getting the other the UDT
01:27:13.04 --> 01:27:17.60 UDT seal reserves going so then when they did that I joined that but then I
01:27:17.60 --> 01:27:22.000 Got real busy and I dropped out of that for a while. What did you do when you
01:27:22.80 --> 01:27:27.04 When when you were in the reserves and now you're re-entering the civilian world what did you do?
01:27:27.68 --> 01:27:29.68 School where'd you go to school for?
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:38.64 Anything I get as quick as possible because I was 24 years old and I wanted to get out of school because my contemporaries were very young
01:27:38.96 --> 01:27:40.96 And I just wanted to get out
01:27:41.20 --> 01:27:46.72 So I went I tried to jam through that as quick as I could and where'd you get a degree in history?
01:27:46.72 --> 01:27:49.68 And then a minor in business and then what'd you do?
01:27:51.28 --> 01:27:53.28 Well, one of the
01:27:54.32 --> 01:28:01.04 Actually before school started I hitchhiked around the world so at that time you could hitchhike around the world
01:28:01.60 --> 01:28:06.72 And I wanted to see the world and see what was going on, you know, and so we started in
01:28:07.44 --> 01:28:13.44 LA and we got in those days you could get a car and if you drove it to New York
01:28:13.44 --> 01:28:18.08 They would pay for the gas so it was free because we only had $1200
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:19.52 We were in the world
01:28:19.52 --> 01:28:21.52 It was a service
01:28:21.52 --> 01:28:24.48 Instead of transporting it they let people drive it across
01:28:25.36 --> 01:28:34.16 So it's like we early form that Uber yeah, yeah, it was you drive Uber right so we got in this car and this car was a brand new
01:28:35.60 --> 01:28:41.20 God was it something British right and it could go go like an angi or something no no it was better than mg
01:28:41.20 --> 01:28:46.04 Really I can't remember what it was but it was small but it was really
01:28:46.04 --> 01:28:49.04 Triumph maybe a triumph so no it was
01:28:50.40 --> 01:28:54.16 It was something pretty nice I can't imagine a worse decision
01:28:54.16 --> 01:28:59.68 And so we can't build those straight out of the knob we could fast break the car to drive across
01:28:59.68 --> 01:29:01.84 Car's and gas money
01:29:01.84 --> 01:29:06.64 This is bad decision but no wonder this kind of Uber didn't work out did you ruin it?
01:29:06.64 --> 01:29:11.36 So we get this car on a like a Friday
01:29:12.16 --> 01:29:18.40 After noon and you have to call the guy and say okay we're leaving Los Angeles right now and we'll be there
01:29:18.40 --> 01:29:20.64 Maybe Tuesday or Wednesday right
01:29:21.36 --> 01:29:26.40 So 49 hours later we get to New York City and we call the guy and he said hey, we're here
01:29:26.64 --> 01:29:30.48 He said you're here 49 hours to go 3000 miles
01:29:30.48 --> 01:29:41.60 Well, we left we really left earlier than Friday right and we were literally going a lot a hundred miles an hour across the nation and at that time
01:29:41.60 --> 01:29:49.44 You could really go right and so then we just got on the airplane at that time that cheapest airline was Icelandic airline
01:29:49.44 --> 01:29:53.84 But she had to spend three days in Iceland so that was cool right who are you with you?
01:29:53.84 --> 01:30:02.72 My travel friend a guy that I'd known for 10 years. He was really a great guy. Just another guy from Linward that you grew up with yeah
01:30:03.36 --> 01:30:12.88 He was really he's a big dude and that worked out well for us because the hitchhiking could be a little if he at times and then we got to
01:30:14.72 --> 01:30:19.52 Where we pulled wherever we pulled in Europe but they had a real late winter and we didn't have any winter clothes
01:30:19.52 --> 01:30:28.32 So we only stayed in Europe like a month and then we went down to we went down to Israel and if you wanted to work in Israel
01:30:28.64 --> 01:30:32.56 So we went and got a job at a kaboots in Israel for three months
01:30:32.72 --> 01:30:35.04 So that was really good. What were you doing there?
01:30:35.44 --> 01:30:37.44 Just working on this
01:30:37.44 --> 01:30:45.92 Kaboots and I was a beekeeper and so they made me a beekeeper sitting and then a painter and so we were doing that and they paid us five dollars a month and
01:30:45.92 --> 01:30:52.32 And free room and board but that was cool because then we could see all the sights in Israel because I always wanted to go to Israel
01:30:52.32 --> 01:30:57.76 Right and pay and at that time you could hit check all over Israel anybody would pick you up and
01:30:58.08 --> 01:31:05.28 Let's say you're going from hypha where we were down south to you know the deadsear whatever you could do that
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:11.76 It was really good and we left there and just started hitchhiking across the world. Is this like 1970 or so?
01:31:12.72 --> 01:31:14.72 701
01:31:14.72 --> 01:31:17.52 Yeah, 71 I think
01:31:18.80 --> 01:31:26.32 Yeah, and what's the when you're when you're home from Vietnam and you know you're talking about earlier, you know people are
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:31.04 They think you're a soldier they're looking down and you did you feel out once you were back? Absolutely
01:31:31.04 --> 01:31:36.000 I mean I really had regret that I didn't stay in the military because
01:31:37.28 --> 01:31:39.68 You know the people wouldn't have anything to do with you
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:42.40 Of course as soon as you got out you let your hair grow a little longer
01:31:42.40 --> 01:31:45.28 You know and so that you fit in more
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:51.36 rather than you know not having any hair so that kind of mask what was going on
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:55.36 But I mean the you know the hippies were just plain
01:31:55.76 --> 01:32:01.28 You know nasty I mean they the thing I hated about it. They had dirty knees and dirty elbows
01:32:01.60 --> 01:32:06.48 They didn't take shower all the time and they stumped and they smelled like marijuana
01:32:07.04 --> 01:32:09.04 I mean it was really nasty
01:32:09.04 --> 01:32:11.04 You know in the women were
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:14.80 I mean they didn't keep themselves up it was it was bad so I had no
01:32:15.68 --> 01:32:17.68 Inkling there that I wanted to be a hippie
01:32:18.08 --> 01:32:21.52 I just didn't I don't get any inkling that you were much too many
01:32:22.72 --> 01:32:26.24 Nobody wanted to be a well none of my y'all wanted to be a hippie, right?
01:32:27.12 --> 01:32:29.12 So how long did this
01:32:29.12 --> 01:32:30.32 Did this
01:32:30.32 --> 01:32:34.08 Hey, Tricking scenario hours about ten months took us ten months to go around the world
01:32:35.28 --> 01:32:40.48 Did you keep going did you keep ahead me staff to go to Israel? Oh, yeah, we hitchhiked across
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:43.84 Well, that time you couldn't go to an Arab country after Israel
01:32:44.16 --> 01:32:50.56 So you had to go to Cyprus then from Cyprus to Turkey then we just started hitchhiking at Turkey and made it across Afghanistan
01:32:51.68 --> 01:32:54.64 And then through India, you know, and we could make it to Bangladesh
01:32:55.20 --> 01:32:58.000 Well, Bangladesh was east Pakistan at the time
01:32:58.16 --> 01:33:00.96 They didn't have Bangladesh because a lot of countries changed
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:07.28 You know since then and we made it there then we had to get on an aircraft because we couldn't go across Burma
01:33:07.28 --> 01:33:12.40 And you know go we did go to Burma spend a couple of days there then
01:33:13.12 --> 01:33:20.56 To Japan and back to the States sometimes you either had a fly or be out of ship because you can't hitchhike on the water, right?
01:33:23.76 --> 01:33:30.80 And did you feel like at the end of that that you had sort of gotten your fill of and seeing what you wanted to see?
01:33:31.20 --> 01:33:35.52 Yeah, and for that sector, yeah, but you know, I really I always
01:33:35.52 --> 01:33:38.24 We did a West Pack, you know with
01:33:39.60 --> 01:33:45.44 UDT so we saw you know China which is Hong Kong at the time and Japan and stuff so
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:50.000 You know, but then the next year I went to school and then we took the summer off
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.72 We got student loans to travel in the summer not to go through school to the G.I. Bill, right?
01:33:55.28 --> 01:34:00.40 And so got student loans and we hitchhiked to Chile and came back in a three month period
01:34:00.40 --> 01:34:04.80 So that was good. What are you doing on the when you're in Chile? What are you doing?
01:34:05.52 --> 01:34:13.36 For instance we're just hitchhiking and seeing what's going on with the people you know and because then you travel with the people and you really see what's going on
01:34:13.84 --> 01:34:16.48 You really see rather than be it on an airplane
01:34:16.80 --> 01:34:20.56 You see their mode of transportation what they eat and you know
01:34:21.44 --> 01:34:23.44 We never had a problem
01:34:23.60 --> 01:34:29.92 Never had a problem. You said you did a West Pack with UDT when was the West Pack with UDT? No, that was during Vietnam
01:34:29.92 --> 01:34:37.20 I mean that was called a West Pack right yeah and being on board ship for that two months we did saline too
01:34:38.56 --> 01:34:40.56 So then you do this trip
01:34:40.72 --> 01:34:45.92 Now now you get back to California and now you got to like grow up kind of well
01:34:47.04 --> 01:34:55.36 No then it was then I had a very serious major in college. It was beer and women and so I was I excelled
01:34:55.36 --> 01:34:57.36 Well
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:04.48 Where'd you go to college when you got back orange goes college and orange County and you continue to study history?
01:35:04.56 --> 01:35:09.76 Is that what you started? Yeah because it was the quickest way of getting out of college and you just wanted to get out and get it some kind of a job
01:35:09.76 --> 01:35:13.76 Just wanted to rock and roll. That's right. Just go get some kind of work so I could make money
01:35:14.56 --> 01:35:16.96 Then what was it two years and you finished college?
01:35:17.68 --> 01:35:19.68 No, it was actually
01:35:19.68 --> 01:35:26.88 I had to start over because I took a lot of stuff that wouldn't transfer to an academic major because I took a practical art
01:35:27.04 --> 01:35:34.16 With auto mechanics, but then it took me like a year and a half to get out of junior college and another year and a half to get out of
01:35:35.36 --> 01:35:39.52 You know big boy college and then what what then I went to work
01:35:39.52 --> 01:35:50.88 I went to work for machine re manufacturers and I got back into the reserves what you're to get back in the reserves oh
01:35:50.80 --> 01:35:53.28 These maybe 75 I think they you know
01:35:53.28 --> 01:35:57.36 I told you earlier that I had COVID real bad. I lost part of my memory
01:35:57.76 --> 01:36:01.76 So I have hard time with dates and names. I just can't remember what it was
01:36:02.48 --> 01:36:05.28 I mean that's might not have anything to do with COVID
01:36:05.28 --> 01:36:10.32 Am I doing a fact that it's 40 something years ago and you did a lot of care at the time when I got going back to those herbs
01:36:10.32 --> 01:36:12.32 Whatever
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:17.84 Yeah, it's funny. I find myself I can't remember sometimes what platoon's I was in because people like I did a split in this with whom I'm like
01:36:17.84 --> 01:36:22.56 I'm like what platoon was that I kind of forget sometimes when it's like your whole life
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:27.68 For a year and a half is your platoon and I'm like what kind of idiot am I that I don't remember a
01:36:27.68 --> 01:36:29.68 Wupple tune I was at I can usually back
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:34.56 But a deconstruct what it was and figured out so you go back in the reserves and
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:38.24 But you when you're back in the reserves. Are you part of the UDT reserves? Yes
01:36:38.72 --> 01:36:44.48 They started it then whenever that was and then and then what are you doing one weekend a month?
01:36:44.48 --> 01:36:48.88 Yeah, and you're going down and you're making beer and doing it your condosants? No, no
01:36:48.88 --> 01:36:56.64 I mean it actually looked UDT really cleaned up because then they saw what seal team did that cut the way for us
01:36:56.88 --> 01:36:58.88 So we would do more seal team things
01:36:58.88 --> 01:37:04.88 Then we would do UDT because UDT was a thing of the past so that was really good
01:37:05.68 --> 01:37:08.08 And so we did that I did that and then
01:37:09.68 --> 01:37:17.68 You know I don't know how many years I did that and I got out for a while then I came back in like 86
01:37:18.88 --> 01:37:22.08 and came back into reserves and
01:37:24.24 --> 01:37:26.24 Then you know it was it was
01:37:26.24 --> 01:37:31.84 You know that was really good and then the I know in that book
01:37:32.72 --> 01:37:36.000 And the volume mentioned that in the first when the first Gulf War kicked off
01:37:36.56 --> 01:37:40.64 Yeah, you Rogered up today send me what happened with that well
01:37:41.92 --> 01:37:43.92 I got
01:37:43.92 --> 01:37:51.36 I wasn't fully qualified on a couple of things and so they wouldn't send me and so you know that was cool
01:37:51.36 --> 01:37:55.36 And I just made me work harder to get up to speed on everything so
01:37:55.36 --> 01:37:57.36 It just didn't work out
01:37:57.92 --> 01:37:59.92 But you know what can you do? I mean
01:38:00.64 --> 01:38:05.52 If you're not if you don't have those calls you don't have those calls. I look on. Didn't you have like dive suit for something?
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:07.68 Yeah, I mean just like the standard kind of seal
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:13.60 Yeah, we just just like that because I got in a year before but I I kind of evolved
01:38:14.24 --> 01:38:18.56 I was 40 years old I think at the time I can't remember how old I was and
01:38:19.60 --> 01:38:22.40 You know you're not gonna run and gun like
01:38:22.40 --> 01:38:30.64 These studgy dudes right here, right? You're not gonna do it because you can't do it. Mm-hmm. Right? No matter how much you work out or you know
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:37.68 And so I said you know I really have to find my place and see where I'm an asset
01:38:38.40 --> 01:38:44.48 And so the training department was really good for me because there was a big paper push there
01:38:44.88 --> 01:38:46.88 And I got to work in training and
01:38:47.44 --> 01:38:50.88 Then I got to go to a lot of places. I could volunteer
01:38:50.88 --> 01:38:59.36 I would volunteer for 30 to 60 days a year to go to exercise as to support the teams so that was really good for me, you know?
01:39:00.08 --> 01:39:02.08 And so
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:04.08 I learned a lot because of that
01:39:04.08 --> 01:39:06.48 What do you remember about when you know
01:39:07.52 --> 01:39:12.16 UDT 13 got decommissioned and then UDT 11 and 12
01:39:12.64 --> 01:39:14.40 Sun said it and became
01:39:14.40 --> 01:39:22.64 CLT 13 38 18 18 5 18 3 so you were were you still on the reserves at that time? I wasn't in and so that I did I missed that process
01:39:23.28 --> 01:39:29.04 And then of course the funding and I don't know because I wasn't there but that's what I think happened
01:39:29.20 --> 01:39:35.44 The funding process and the leadership process went from the navy from big navy to so-called
01:39:36.16 --> 01:39:42.40 And so I'm sure people listening to this that live that will find fault with me on my fax
01:39:42.40 --> 01:39:45.44 But it was a different world the navy
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:48.16 You know this
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:51.88 Team guys were thin very quickly right very
01:39:51.88 --> 01:39:53.92 We're out of welcome me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
01:39:53.92 --> 01:40:00.08 We're out and you have to really protect yourself against that because then the other units won't work with you
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:02.72 And if they won't work with you, you can't do it by yourself
01:40:03.68 --> 01:40:10.48 So yeah, well, we definitely learned that lesson over time of yourself just getting to working with your counterparts and
01:40:10.48 --> 01:40:15.20 Skiing them the support that you can give absolutely because then they'll support you back right
01:40:15.92 --> 01:40:18.80 So after the first goal for where you got denied
01:40:20.08 --> 01:40:26.24 But then you realized alright, I got to figure out how I can help what I can do and you stay in the reserves
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:29.28 for the next 10 years and
01:40:29.60 --> 01:40:34.08 Then September 11 happens. Yes, where where were you at September and September 11th?
01:40:35.76 --> 01:40:38.80 September I was actually gonna go to work for
01:40:38.80 --> 01:40:45.44 The boats and help promote their recruiting okay and so
01:40:46.32 --> 01:40:49.12 That was on the 10th of December
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:59.20 I mean 10th of September and so I was gonna go work with them like a DOD job to help promote that or be an active reserve
01:40:59.20 --> 01:41:01.20 As they hadn't worked it out so
01:41:01.60 --> 01:41:05.60 Then they said on the 10th they said don't come down because we're not using it
01:41:05.60 --> 01:41:09.36 We'll give you a call the next week tell you because we don't have your funding
01:41:10.16 --> 01:41:13.20 Appropriated yet and so on then you'll 11th
01:41:13.84 --> 01:41:19.84 My friend calls me and he says have you watched the TV and I'd worked all night because I was doing us flipping houses right
01:41:19.84 --> 01:41:25.20 And I worked out all night on this one property and I went home and he calls me data clock in the morning
01:41:25.20 --> 01:41:26.72 So she said you see the TV and I said no
01:41:27.12 --> 01:41:30.88 He says get down and watch a TV so then that's what the tower is he said
01:41:31.28 --> 01:41:33.52 So I call the unit and I said hey
01:41:33.52 --> 01:41:39.12 I'm available what what's going on don't come because the base was were you in a documentary?
01:41:39.12 --> 01:41:44.56 I was I was actually going to call it okay the Navy had me in college at that time and I was doing the same thing
01:41:44.56 --> 01:41:47.60 I was calling my detail and saying hey sir
01:41:48.16 --> 01:41:51.28 I'll quit college right now. I'll finish this stuff later. I don't care
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:59.04 And you know I had this conversation with him it was it was Admiral Puyvis and he I had worked for him before and he was an awesome boss
01:41:59.04 --> 01:42:03.76 He's a great and when September 11th happened I called him and said hey
01:42:03.76 --> 01:42:07.12 I'll do anything you know send me back to see what the amount of money I don't need my degree. I'll do my degree
01:42:07.12 --> 01:42:10.64 All mine whatever and which cool is you know
01:42:10.64 --> 01:42:16.000 I think I'm you know being all default aggressive and stuff but I talked to him a couple of years ago
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.32 I actually talked to him and his wife and guess what every guy that was not a team was calling up saying hey
01:42:22.32 --> 01:42:25.04 I'm ready to go I'm ready to go that's that's the community
01:42:25.04 --> 01:42:29.92 It's everyone wanted to get to go fight. That's what we do
01:42:30.32 --> 01:42:32.32 The world where two guys are caught yeah
01:42:33.92 --> 01:42:35.92 Exactly
01:42:36.48 --> 01:42:39.60 So you call up and you and what they tell you
01:42:40.08 --> 01:42:45.20 They said don't come to base. It's a lockdown but come because they could activate me on
01:42:45.60 --> 01:42:49.44 Reservist orders and because I knew it was gonna happen because
01:42:49.92 --> 01:42:54.96 We had some of those same problems and Vietnam here and so I'm good at making
01:42:54.96 --> 01:43:00.16 Little things happen and so they I went down there. I think on a Friday
01:43:00.16 --> 01:43:04.000 I think the 9 11 was on a Tuesday. I just can't remember and
01:43:04.72 --> 01:43:10.40 So then I went down there that Friday and then went to group one and started working some issues that they had
01:43:11.12 --> 01:43:13.12 Especially activating reservists
01:43:14.08 --> 01:43:19.52 Yeah, because all of the sudden we need to manage all kinds of petitions a lot of positions and the team's guys
01:43:19.52 --> 01:43:25.04 Team positions a team guys didn't want to do and rightfully so but it was good to get the
01:43:25.04 --> 01:43:30.24 Reservist back in to that line of fire so that they could you know
01:43:30.56 --> 01:43:33.68 Because you know you gotta get it on you know and
01:43:34.40 --> 01:43:36.40 It takes a while to get up to speed
01:43:37.68 --> 01:43:41.20 So the war kicks off in Afghanistan at what point did you
01:43:42.08 --> 01:43:45.68 Did you get on the on the freaking launch pad to go to Iraq
01:43:45.68 --> 01:43:49.68 How old were you at that point?
01:43:52.16 --> 01:43:54.96 2003 is when you went no
01:43:56.64 --> 01:43:58.64 I think I wouldn't
01:43:59.60 --> 01:44:04.64 Either 2002 or 2003 I can't remember but before the war just before the war started
01:44:05.20 --> 01:44:08.64 So what happened is I'm there working for group and I would
01:44:08.64 --> 01:44:17.20 A great guy that I really really love Jim Jimmy Baron Mass Chief Baron. I don't know if you remember him sir
01:44:18.72 --> 01:44:25.20 Mass Chief Baron was working on a DPVs. They actually pulled them out of storage a DPV is a tuned bug
01:44:25.20 --> 01:44:30.56 He looking thing with the is it a 50 or a 60 on the top? I don't remember right? I think it could be either
01:44:30.56 --> 01:44:40.24 Yeah, you could go either way on that's like me and I shouldn't say that little joke, but I would I'll refrain there
01:44:39.84 --> 01:44:40.88 And so
01:44:41.12 --> 01:44:47.92 He pulled those out of storage and he was really good wrench turner. I mean he was fabulous. He was a guru
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:50.000 And so I
01:44:50.48 --> 01:44:54.64 Ask him I said you know I'm a heric group. Can I support you guys?
01:44:55.20 --> 01:44:58.48 And he says well you can't do it during a day, but you can come at night
01:44:58.48 --> 01:45:00.48 And so I went there
01:45:01.68 --> 01:45:09.20 A bit to help them because they were trying to push that stuff out the door before Christmas right and so
01:45:10.40 --> 01:45:12.56 I go down there and I'm turning it around you're in here
01:45:13.12 --> 01:45:17.60 Like three o'clock in the morning saying well, it's about we had to be back here at six
01:45:17.84 --> 01:45:22.72 It's about time when he went home, you know that type of thing Baron is a great guy in this whole
01:45:22.72 --> 01:45:28.96 I think there was nine guys involved with Baron on those three or four D.P.Vs
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:35.12 Maybe it was more and so I got to work with him because I wanted to go forward right
01:45:35.68 --> 01:45:38.56 So my boss at group one I said they had
01:45:39.44 --> 01:45:43.52 As soon as we come on board they they have a thing in a conference room and they said okay
01:45:43.52 --> 01:45:46.000 Who wants to go forward who wants to go to the war?
01:45:46.40 --> 01:45:48.40 Everybody raises their hand
01:45:49.20 --> 01:45:51.20 and
01:45:51.20 --> 01:45:54.000 civilian boss it looks at me and he says posi
01:45:54.56 --> 01:45:58.40 He says you're too old you're too fat you're too stupid you're the last guy
01:45:58.40 --> 01:46:03.68 We're gonna say we're gonna slim the cleaning lady before we're gonna send you I said no you're not you're gonna send me
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.48 He says no way in hell okay
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:09.52 And I said yeah you're gonna send me
01:46:09.52 --> 01:46:16.72 He was why was I arguing with my boss right to do have him do me a favor and send me overseas right? Who would do that?
01:46:17.28 --> 01:46:19.28 I was stupid and so
01:46:19.28 --> 01:46:21.28 So here's right
01:46:23.36 --> 01:46:25.36 So he says
01:46:25.36 --> 01:46:31.04 He says now we got a lot of work for you to do we got to push all these guys out because you know the
01:46:31.76 --> 01:46:36.72 The reserves at that time weren't really we had kind of a
01:46:37.36 --> 01:46:43.60 Looser type of reserve unit and they weren't deployed that off it so some of them had ID cards that weren't current
01:46:43.60 --> 01:46:48.24 I mean there is you know and there will's were from three wives back in
01:46:48.24 --> 01:46:55.52 In 1972, you know and you had to bring all that amount of paperwork that usually took four or five days
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.24 And we were trying to facilitate these guys through the system to get them out the door
01:47:00.56 --> 01:47:05.76 You know and to get them you know just basic training because we didn't do a lot of chemical training
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:08.24 Basic chemical training and all that kind of thing
01:47:08.88 --> 01:47:15.04 So I was doing that and I was working DPVs at night and finally master chief Baron
01:47:15.04 --> 01:47:19.36 I think it was the 26th of December and
01:47:21.76 --> 01:47:25.28 And so I said man I was really hoping I could go with those guys
01:47:25.92 --> 01:47:32.16 So anyhow they have like a couple of weeks later they said we need somebody to go over
01:47:33.60 --> 01:47:34.80 to
01:47:35.04 --> 01:47:39.28 There to help service vehicles on humvies because we never had a lot of humvies
01:47:39.28 --> 01:47:45.92 We never had a lot of vehicles and seal tape especially there was no up armor no armor and they were put at least humvies out of
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:51.04 Out of the surplus storage from the army. I mean they were just thrashed right
01:47:52.64 --> 01:47:55.84 So I said you know I'm really good mechanic
01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.08 I didn't ever I never opened a hood of a humvie right didn't have a clue
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:05.12 I said I'm really a good mechanic and I think you should send me and look at it
01:48:05.12 --> 01:48:06.88 I mean that's 56 years old right
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.20 so
01:48:09.20 --> 01:48:12.88 Eventually because they couldn't find anybody better than me which was
01:48:13.52 --> 01:48:20.96 The first wrong of the latter. I mean they said okay you're you're going you're going over and you're gonna work on these humvies
01:48:20.96 --> 01:48:27.20 And editor I said well, what are we gonna do about tools and they said well Baron has all the tools and he has all the stuff
01:48:27.84 --> 01:48:35.52 But everybody knows and any given wartime situation that you don't whatever you need the most you never get
01:48:35.52 --> 01:48:40.56 I mean if you need that special gun or whatever it is it never shows up right
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:46.08 So I go to Harbor Freight and I buy this gigantic box of tools because I know
01:48:46.72 --> 01:48:52.88 That those you know those assets aren't gonna be there and so I took my box of tools and they
01:48:53.44 --> 01:48:58.88 He hadn't got their tools all their tools and they're coming over borrow they had all snap on stuff
01:48:58.88 --> 01:48:59.68 You know
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:06.64 With the snap on shirt and you know the $10,000 box just the box alone was $10,000
01:49:06.96 --> 01:49:08.48 I got my Harbor Freight
01:49:08.48 --> 01:49:12.000 298 the crescent wrench right and so
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:16.24 Posty could we we really need a a number 11 metric
01:49:17.04 --> 01:49:18.88 Endurance you got of course I got it
01:49:20.96 --> 01:49:22.96 So they sent me over and they had these
01:49:24.16 --> 01:49:25.52 these
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:32.56 Highlux tie-outers and they were gonna use on initial invasion and they put winches and all kinds of different stuff on them
01:49:32.88 --> 01:49:34.88 But the high-lux shows up
01:49:34.88 --> 01:49:39.76 But all the other stuff's not put on so that was my I think the first couple of weeks
01:49:40.08 --> 01:49:45.04 I was putting on all the stuff to the high-luxes to get them out and then
01:49:46.40 --> 01:49:52.64 We had a lot of servicing of humvies and all that and a lot of re-org stuff and so
01:49:52.64 --> 01:49:56.64 Then they were looking for people to go forward who's gonna go in this position?
01:49:58.48 --> 01:49:59.68 Me
01:49:59.68 --> 01:50:03.04 God come on come on we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:06.08 cheese low-weas and so
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:12.88 So I'm stuck back at the base that I'm doing different stuff that I really don't like to do and I'm listening
01:50:12.88 --> 01:50:17.44 You know to see when a chance of me going forward what's what's the need what kind of
01:50:17.84 --> 01:50:21.04 talent that I have because I think most of us
01:50:21.04 --> 01:50:28.16 Marine Corps and different facets of society we have a place in society like I'm not a leader at all
01:50:28.40 --> 01:50:33.20 I'm a follower, but I'm a real good follower the command you know commanders intent
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:39.36 I want to hear the commanders intent that I want to explore with the commander what that intent is
01:50:39.44 --> 01:50:41.44 I want to know what it really means
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:45.76 Because sometimes the words don't convey what that person really thinks
01:50:45.76 --> 01:50:53.36 I want to know how I can support that person any way possible, you know what's his real meaning
01:50:53.60 --> 01:50:59.60 What's those words coming out of his mouth? How can I help if I can make my sailors
01:51:00.64 --> 01:51:09.44 Have whatever they need and they're happy and then secondary that if I can make my boss look good and then the navy look good
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.28 Then it's cool right?
01:51:11.28 --> 01:51:19.36 Yeah, it's cool. I mean everybody's cool because that's they want you around then if you get they say well who did this?
01:51:20.48 --> 01:51:24.88 And say posey did it and so it was a good thing right? I mean
01:51:25.52 --> 01:51:32.48 You know you did this rider whatever I say no no no no wasn't me it was my two subordinate smucketyly and
01:51:33.04 --> 01:51:38.40 Jura Dally here so I always try to defer that or push it back to my boss
01:51:38.40 --> 01:51:44.96 Because that's what makes you valuable and if you need a favor some time those people will come
01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:48.56 Forward and I learned that and Vietnam
01:51:49.28 --> 01:51:51.68 When we would go to these different places
01:51:52.72 --> 01:51:56.24 They would leave like flags and pictures of
01:51:56.80 --> 01:51:59.52 Different things and China and pottery
01:51:59.60 --> 01:52:06.72 Then we were able to take those assets to the guys that were on the navy bases and if we needed
01:52:06.72 --> 01:52:10.32 You know cases see rats at the time or
01:52:11.04 --> 01:52:14.96 Would you guys mind you're unloading all this beer out of this ship and
01:52:15.28 --> 01:52:21.20 Would you guys mind pushing a pallet of this beer off the dock and let it fall into the water and
01:52:21.36 --> 01:52:26.44 Then we'll retrieve it and I'll trade you this Viet Cong flag with fat genuine Vietnam blood
01:52:26.80 --> 01:52:30.80 They didn't know his pigs blood with a couple bullet holes that we shot in a parking lot
01:52:30.80 --> 01:52:39.36 We would really appreciate that you know so we could barter our way and Vietnam because we had no money
01:52:39.36 --> 01:52:42.08 We had no assets we could barter our way
01:52:42.96 --> 01:52:49.20 Into different things and then I knew because so many people hadn't been to the war since Vietnam
01:52:49.20 --> 01:52:53.68 Well, they did of course they did the 96 hour war and they did other little wars
01:52:53.68 --> 01:52:55.44 But they didn't have a supply trade
01:52:55.44 --> 01:53:03.60 I knew that I could be valuable there securing assets for my team we only had 44 guys originally and bagged at
01:53:05.92 --> 01:53:10.16 So before I went I went on the internet and I bought
01:53:10.56 --> 01:53:12.56 I should have bought 12 I bought six
01:53:13.20 --> 01:53:16.56 Iraqi flags and I took them with me and then I took
01:53:17.20 --> 01:53:21.20 $550 of cash at small bills and another
01:53:21.20 --> 01:53:26.56 $500 in large bills because I knew that there's soon as we won that the
01:53:27.52 --> 01:53:29.84 Currency would be no longer valid and
01:53:30.08 --> 01:53:36.40 That you could buy that currency at a bargain rate and be able to do something with that currency right
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.32 And so when the war started I mean when the war ended as far as George Bush calling it off
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:50.000 Nobody knew what to do with the currency so before it was like a 16 to one ratio with their
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000 Iraqi currency for the American dollar and it and then by the time
01:53:56.48 --> 01:54:01.44 Bush called the war off it was in limbo and you could do a thousand to one you could literally buy
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.92 I turned my $550 into Rocky dinner and I could buy a box of money a box of money
01:54:11.52 --> 01:54:16.88 And so but there's nothing to buy there's nothing to buy that the sanctions really worked in Iraq
01:54:16.88 --> 01:54:20.08 There was nothing to buy and so
01:54:21.20 --> 01:54:29.52 I had all this money and I had the I brought the flags and I was trading because we don't have an seal team when I got to Iraq
01:54:29.52 --> 01:54:34.80 We don't have it a logistics tale right at that time now we have a logistics tale. They got so much smarter
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:41.60 But we didn't I was those logistics tale and as soon as we get we we went
01:54:42.96 --> 01:54:44.96 Real quick so you weren't you were in Kuwait
01:54:44.96 --> 01:54:51.12 Yes, when you were preparing to go. Yes, they're saying hey, we need someone to so so the troops push up in a bag
01:54:51.12 --> 01:54:52.80 Dad, yes, you're still in Kuwait
01:54:52.80 --> 01:54:57.12 Right, finally they go look we need someone to help us up there. We got vehicles to maintain
01:54:57.12 --> 01:55:02.24 We got to build a base they're looking around they keep looking past you and finally they freaking got no choice
01:55:02.24 --> 01:55:05.60 But they said no man up there to go get some I'm the last
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.52 Vision of the world
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:13.36 So what do you do jump on a yellow and fly up to to bag that international or do you drive up? No, no, no, so they tell me
01:55:13.36 --> 01:55:19.28 They tell me I was a huge area. Wait now is the team you could hitchhike releasing it. It was really quick
01:55:20.08 --> 01:55:27.20 I love hitchhiking because you meet a lot interesting people but anyhow I have my own vehicle because I'm the like the
01:55:29.44 --> 01:55:36.24 The go to guy to get things done for whatever you know little things you know somebody's got this or they need that or whatever
01:55:36.24 --> 01:55:42.80 So they tell me at five minutes after one and in Kuwait they said you have to be it
01:55:43.84 --> 01:55:46.32 Help me with the name of the airbase by a

01:58:33.04 --> 01:58:35.04 Telling him what to do so
01:58:35.60 --> 01:58:38.000 So we get there and he says okay we're going down

01:58:51.04 --> 01:58:54.08 So we jump on this pallet well it wasn't a five and five
01:58:54.08 --> 01:58:59.84 They were on actually on the deck right and they let us out of this aircraft and we're going about 20 miles in there
01:58:59.84 --> 01:59:06.56 But we just rode the pallet out and our guys and we we have all this ammunition and all this stuff that they needed and so
01:59:09.04 --> 01:59:15.12 We immediately head over to this hedge and just sit there for about a half hour and our guys eventually
01:59:16.40 --> 01:59:21.20 They knew we were there but they were afraid that some you know they're rackies we're gonna get on us and so

01:59:42.24 --> 01:59:47.52 I said my god I should have took a picture of that because they didn't love us after a couple of weeks
01:59:47.52 --> 01:59:52.08 Right, so we go to buy up. There's nobody there so we go to all a
01:59:52.08 --> 02:00:00.64 Lendi palace no the first no I'm sorry we go to the CIA headquarters the Rackie CIA headquarters
02:00:01.04 --> 02:00:07.68 And we're we're mustering there for a day or two so we get in there and what they did is they used a J-Dam
02:00:08.08 --> 02:00:12.64 and they collapsed the six story Iraqi CIA headquarters
02:00:13.60 --> 02:00:15.84 down they pancaked it down to two
02:00:15.84 --> 02:00:22.16 Two two sections of the building that survived and so there was court item
02:00:22.88 --> 02:00:29.36 Concrete dust everywhere and it was very hard to breathe and so we go in there and I said you know we had to go
02:00:30.40 --> 02:00:32.40 We had to go to
02:00:32.40 --> 02:00:37.36 These offices the top office should be a head dude in a Iraqi CIA right
02:00:37.92 --> 02:00:44.000 The head guy has the top office we had to go see what we can see so we make our way through all this
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.68 Construction stuff destructions stuff and we go to the top office and it's Uday's office right and so I opened a
02:00:51.68 --> 02:00:54.56 Destroir of Uday's office and he's got these
02:00:55.52 --> 02:01:03.52 Chrome sunglasses that like Elvis wore right I said and the guy I was with
02:01:04.48 --> 02:01:06.24 The chief that I was with he
02:01:06.24 --> 02:01:14.96 He grabs his glasses and then he had on his desk a picture of him and these glasses and so he grabs that and he says
02:01:15.84 --> 02:01:20.72 Okay, which one do you want? I said I'll take the glasses and he says okay
02:01:21.44 --> 02:01:25.52 So he takes the picture and I take the glasses so I got two days glasses
02:01:25.84 --> 02:01:31.92 So we stay there a couple of days and then I go out that morning that we're supposed to leave because
02:01:31.92 --> 02:01:37.52 I wanted to make sure the vehicle was serviced and ready to go because we had gasoline
02:01:37.52 --> 02:01:41.76 We had ammunition we had mortars we had all kinds of stuff on this
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:45.04 Six by truck and I think we had three or four vehicles
02:01:45.44 --> 02:01:51.20 So I'm up into cab of this truck making sure everything's done and I have my bayonet that I had in Vietnam
02:01:51.76 --> 02:01:57.44 And I'm sitting in the seat like this and my bayonet gets stuck in this MTVR truck
02:01:58.08 --> 02:02:00.08 There and then they start shooting at me
02:02:00.08 --> 02:02:05.52 You know and it's just I mean it's five o'clock in the morning the sun just come up in their shooting at me right
02:02:05.92 --> 02:02:08.56 Say man I got to get out of this truck because it could go
02:02:08.88 --> 02:02:11.68 You know if they hit the gasoline God knows what's going on
02:02:11.68 --> 02:02:21.44 So I'm trying to get out of this truck and I'm trying to push this stupid bayonet over to the side and I'm pulling on pulling and I go out the side of the truck and I didn't
02:02:22.16 --> 02:02:24.96 See this culvert right here and I go
02:02:24.96 --> 02:02:35.28 I do the big crash I got my weapon and across my chest and my battle rattle and man it's killing me it's killing me and so
02:02:37.28 --> 02:02:43.68 I get out of there and I walk back to there and you know whatever and we go then we go to Al Rindi Palace and
02:02:45.20 --> 02:02:50.000 We said well the army's gonna come in here to buy up and they're gonna run things
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:56.24 There they eight hundred pound gorilla right they're always the eight hundred pound gorilla no matter where we go we shouldn't this
02:02:56.64 --> 02:02:58.24 Carmander's making this decision
02:02:58.48 --> 02:03:02.80 We should go find another place because we don't want to get kicked out once we start improving it
02:03:02.80 --> 02:03:08.08 So we go down to the servants quarters and they have some nice little buildings there, but they burn off
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:14.16 Out some of the buildings and they stole all the air conditioning and the wiring into walls and everything and
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:19.04 So we go in there and that's that's our that's our camcini posing right
02:03:19.04 --> 02:03:27.36 It wasn't Jenny Posi the type and so we go there. It's Neptune tried and you know every seal team name that no demand
02:03:28.48 --> 02:03:33.84 So we start improving that camp because we know we're gonna have a lot of people laid on in that camp
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:37.36 You know just not the 18 that we originally started with
02:03:38.56 --> 02:03:42.88 So we go to this camp and we start improving it and I don't know if you'd know
02:03:42.88 --> 02:03:49.92 Ranger I don't want to say his last time. Okay. Yeah, we're all calling Ranger right and this guy's a master
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:55.52 I mean because so we're in biopin where the only cut the only people and biopin there's some
02:03:56.16 --> 02:03:57.20 little
02:03:57.20 --> 02:04:00.64 You know scirmish and stuff out of town, but there's not a whole lot going it
02:04:00.64 --> 02:04:06.40 So we're going to biopin we're going to the army and it's like being with us a rockstar people are saying
02:04:07.92 --> 02:04:10.48 I mean he's driving this Humvee right John
02:04:10.48 --> 02:04:15.52 John we haven't seen you since Grenada John we haven't seen you since Panama how you doing?
02:04:15.52 --> 02:04:18.96 I mean the guys are rockstar there in the army right
02:04:19.68 --> 02:04:23.20 Said man I'm happy that I know this guy and so
02:04:24.40 --> 02:04:29.44 We do that then people start coming in and we had a real good opt-empo to begin with
02:04:29.44 --> 02:04:35.36 The seal team was really kicking ass. Okay. We had great commanders great platoon chiefs
02:04:35.36 --> 02:04:42.32 I mean everybody I mean because we thought the war might be a 96 hour war like it was the first Gulf war
02:04:42.32 --> 02:04:46.16 So we want to get as much experience as possible right
02:04:46.88 --> 02:04:50.88 A little did we know it'd be there 22 years later 21 years later
02:04:51.92 --> 02:04:53.60 so
02:04:53.60 --> 02:04:56.24 So we're there improving the camp in this and then
02:04:57.68 --> 02:04:59.68 We're there one day and and
02:04:59.68 --> 02:05:03.28 We have a more de-meated a-dave clock with everybody in the camp and
02:05:03.28 --> 02:05:09.04 John comes in and he says he's swearing and he never swore
02:05:09.44 --> 02:05:12.48 He never swore and he swore he says I'm so sick of this
02:05:13.44 --> 02:05:18.08 Tells a commander right there. I'm so sick of this we're changing the name of this camp
02:05:18.64 --> 02:05:23.68 Nobody knows where this camp we change the name of this camp 15 times since we had been there the army doesn't know where
02:05:23.68 --> 02:05:28.80 They changed the name you know we're naming this camp camp bill Posi
02:05:28.80 --> 02:05:32.80 And I look at him. I said are you out of your mind?
02:05:34.16 --> 02:05:36.16 Are you out of your mind?
02:05:36.16 --> 02:05:45.44 Only dead people or very courageous people have a seal a seal team camp named after him. Are you crazy?
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:49.28 He says no we're doing that we're announcing at the meeting tonight
02:05:50.48 --> 02:05:54.72 John don't don't do that just just let me have time to think about it
02:05:54.72 --> 02:06:01.36 So as soon as the army came in they cut us off our opt-empo we had no operations going because they were afraid of us right?
02:06:01.36 --> 02:06:02.56 They wanted to
02:06:02.56 --> 02:06:09.84 homogenize everything and make everything happen the way they wanted to happen and rightfully so cuz they're gonna swing
02:06:09.84 --> 02:06:11.84 It probably won't be us right?
02:06:12.88 --> 02:06:18.56 So I go to the morning meeting the the mayor's meeting and I said
02:06:19.12 --> 02:06:21.12 Hey, I got some great news
02:06:21.12 --> 02:06:30.48 We're going to rename our camp after an army person because seal team has a greatest respect ever for the army and
02:06:30.80 --> 02:06:36.32 We love what you guys are doing here at buy-up and we think we want to honor you
02:06:36.96 --> 02:06:40.72 And people say Posi what are you talking about sit down you dumb ass?
02:06:41.04 --> 02:06:45.12 I said no no we want to do this and they said okay no problem
02:06:45.68 --> 02:06:48.96 So I go back to my guys and I say okay, let's name the camp
02:06:48.96 --> 02:06:57.04 I had the name it after an army person right and it was either oddie Murphy or my daughter who was a JROTC
02:06:57.84 --> 02:06:59.84 Cadet at UCLA
02:07:02.88 --> 02:07:11.04 Yeah, so we're gonna name the camp either oddie Murphy or my daughter who's a ROTC cadet at thing
02:07:11.36 --> 02:07:16.48 So he said okay, we're gonna name it after your daughter so we name the camp camp jennie Posi right
02:07:16.48 --> 02:07:18.48 So
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:25.44 That was very and I can't believe I mean john coming in there and saying that and people going along with it
02:07:25.44 --> 02:07:31.36 Why would he do that? I just I never figured that out but it worked and and it was really
02:07:31.84 --> 02:07:37.28 Nice of him and nice of the command to allow that to happen because I did not deserve it
02:07:37.28 --> 02:07:38.56 I'm not
02:07:38.56 --> 02:07:44.64 Mike Montsour any of those other very courageous dudes and I wasn't dead yet
02:07:44.64 --> 02:07:47.76 So I thought that might be some bad juge of you know what I'm saying
02:07:48.72 --> 02:07:52.72 Yeah, it was awesome I ended up spending six months at Jenny Posi in
02:07:53.52 --> 02:07:55.52 2003 2004 and
02:07:56.48 --> 02:08:01.36 What was cool was and there's a classic picture this and I'll find it and get it posted somewhere but the
02:08:02.56 --> 02:08:08.24 You know we go out do our operations and we go out for however many hours or days would be out for
02:08:08.24 --> 02:08:14.24 And when you get back to camp there was a big sign on the camp door and it was it was a pretty
02:08:15.04 --> 02:08:20.48 Good selection for the space because we could come we could shut this big giant gate
02:08:21.28 --> 02:08:23.60 And it would just be no there'd be no one on there but us
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.52 But on the you you guys made this big giant sign that's at welcome home to camp jennie Posi and
02:08:29.92 --> 02:08:32.96 It was just an awesome site when you come back no matter what happened out there
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:35.04 You come back and see that big sign to be like all right
02:08:35.04 --> 02:08:37.04 We're good to go so that was
02:08:37.04 --> 02:08:42.24 That was that was the way it should be and it's a pretty freakin legendary situation to have
02:08:43.52 --> 02:08:45.52 It was different
02:08:46.40 --> 02:08:52.96 So how long did you end up staying there in Iraq because you ended up did you end up getting hurt something happened to you?
02:08:53.04 --> 02:08:54.88 Well when I jumped out of the truck
02:08:55.76 --> 02:08:58.000 I didn't know it at the time but I broke my back
02:08:58.56 --> 02:09:06.16 But you know I went to the army that day when we pulled into biop and I said man you guys got to give me something
02:09:06.16 --> 02:09:09.84 Because this my back is killing me and the guy says
02:09:10.64 --> 02:09:14.64 Okay, let me examine you and so he says you don't have a medical record
02:09:14.64 --> 02:09:22.40 So I got an MR E box and put medical record bill pose the here it is. Here's my medical record right and he says why I'm gonna send you back to Germany and
02:09:24.16 --> 02:09:29.04 He said no you're not you're not he says yeah you got your medical record here and I'm gonna send you back
02:09:29.04 --> 02:09:31.52 I took that medical record and I walked out of there and
02:09:31.52 --> 02:09:37.36 He was lucky I got some pills some pain pills before that so that knocked it down
02:09:37.68 --> 02:09:41.84 It wasn't you know it wasn't terribly debilitating so
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:44.96 It worked out so
02:09:45.52 --> 02:09:49.04 Did you roll out on any ops with the boys? Oh, yeah, I got to do 30
02:09:50.80 --> 02:09:54.000 But you know what being 56 years old of course
02:09:54.56 --> 02:09:55.44 You know
02:09:55.44 --> 02:09:56.96 Well grandpa's here
02:09:56.96 --> 02:10:03.76 He's gonna you know he he doesn't have all this teeth, but you know, but you know it's always in the sea too
02:10:03.76 --> 02:10:07.76 You know in a backup so if something happened at least we could get the squirters
02:10:08.16 --> 02:10:12.80 You know and all that and at least take care of them or if we had to
02:10:13.52 --> 02:10:17.52 You know go help those guys in a QRF situation. We were always available, you know
02:10:18.40 --> 02:10:22.64 So that was good, you know, I really enjoyed that I really appreciate them
02:10:22.64 --> 02:10:28.12 Allowing me to do that. I don't know if I'd been an asset or a deficit, you know
02:10:29.12 --> 02:10:32.16 So well I can tell you the you know the having the vehicles out there
02:10:32.16 --> 02:10:36.16 You never know when someone's gonna romp go wrong with a vehicle and to not have a good
02:10:36.80 --> 02:10:40.96 Mechanic there to ready to get those things up and running and like you said those those
02:10:41.20 --> 02:10:45.76 Homevies that we had because we got those homevies turned over up us and we showed up a couple months after you left
02:10:46.88 --> 02:10:49.36 same those things were beat down
02:10:49.36 --> 02:10:56.16 Hand me downs, you know scavenging or hand me dance. I believe they came out of more Marine Corps some of them were
02:10:56.16 --> 02:10:58.32 Seat we got some from some CB somewhere
02:10:58.32 --> 02:11:03.44 We got some somewhere service somewhere canvas doors. I mean they were a total disaster
02:11:03.44 --> 02:11:07.04 But you guys got them up and run and then we kept we know we kept working on them and
02:11:07.60 --> 02:11:10.08 We know what was awesome was it didn't take very long
02:11:10.80 --> 02:11:13.68 Like you said the seal teams not only do we not have vehicles
02:11:14.16 --> 02:11:18.48 But prior to this we didn't have any vehicle procedures either we didn't know anything
02:11:18.48 --> 02:11:21.36 We just we would we actually thought that vehicles
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.16 It was kind of a joke in the seal teams if you got inserted by a vehicle
02:11:26.16 --> 02:11:30.32 We'd call it a he-lo truck right meaning hey, we're just pretending this is a helicopter
02:11:30.32 --> 02:11:36.12 We don't really have one we didn't realize like this is gonna be our primary mode of transportation is gonna be the home
02:11:36.12 --> 02:11:41.28 V not even the D p v's or any of these high speed vehicles for a solid three years there in the middle
02:11:41.28 --> 02:11:45.60 It was a home v and that was it. That's what you were getting and not up armor. Oh, yeah, yeah
02:11:45.60 --> 02:11:47.60 Not up armor at least not in the beginning
02:11:47.60 --> 02:11:50.48 No, not in the beginning and we ended up doing mad max kind of things
02:11:50.48 --> 02:11:57.44 We'd end up with finding the the bullet proof steel eventually we put that on various parts of the home v to try and protect you as much
02:11:57.44 --> 02:11:59.68 You're good. Yeah, the first few months. We were there
02:12:00.08 --> 02:12:03.76 We we had turned the seats in the home v's to face outboard
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.48 So that our our our body armor would be faced not word and we could sit there and scan
02:12:09.04 --> 02:12:12.64 But I mean it was because we took the canvas door to what the good scan was gonna do
02:12:12.96 --> 02:12:14.96 Not gonna do any good at all
02:12:14.96 --> 02:12:21.44 So we we did what we could but we but what was really impressive not only do we get the vehicles up to speed and then we were doing all like the
02:12:21.60 --> 02:12:23.36 NASCAR drills of
02:12:23.36 --> 02:12:30.24 Figuring on how to change tires really quick and it's rigging for toe all those things we rigged all that stuff up all the navigation systems
02:12:30.24 --> 02:12:36.44 Which we got from this the civilian sector of you know just taking a GPS and coupling it with a
02:12:37.60 --> 02:12:41.04 Portable computer and so we'd have the live feed GPS going in there
02:12:41.04 --> 02:12:45.12 It's all stuff that we just figured out and then all the actual immediate action drills
02:12:45.44 --> 02:12:48.96 We did all that within a very short period of time
02:12:49.60 --> 02:12:54.72 Because and it's one of the one of the strong points of the seal teams and one of the weak points of the seal teams
02:12:55.28 --> 02:13:00.08 One of the weak points of the seal teams is we didn't really have any standard operating procedures for a lot of things
02:13:00.08 --> 02:13:05.12 There's no manual like in the army you can pick up a manual and it will show you how to conduct a raid
02:13:05.12 --> 02:13:10.56 You can pick up a manual can show you how to conduct a reconnaissance it can show you how to conduct an immediate action drill in the city
02:13:10.56 --> 02:13:13.20 In the urban environment in the rural environment
02:13:13.20 --> 02:13:18.48 You can pick up manual to find all those things and in the suitings we didn't have that it was all passed down
02:13:18.48 --> 02:13:23.56 Word of mouth over years and so you couldn't just pick up a manual and say oh, refer to the manual on this
02:13:23.80 --> 02:13:27.12 That's a disadvantage because it's nice to have somewhere to start from
02:13:27.20 --> 02:13:34.32 But it's an advantage because our minds are very flexible and very good at problem solving and that turns out to be
02:13:34.64 --> 02:13:39.48 Advantages when you get tasked with a mission that there is no manual for and that's where you're able to do
02:13:39.48 --> 02:13:45.96 We've working out of vehicles and we ended up being extremely proficient in vehicle operations
02:13:46.52 --> 02:13:49.24 very shortly after we started doing them for the first time
02:13:50.12 --> 02:13:54.80 Pretty that's one of the best things about the seal teams open minds and flexibility
02:13:55.20 --> 02:13:56.48 You know and I I
02:13:56.60 --> 02:13:58.20 From my
02:13:58.20 --> 02:14:03.36 Perspective it's more than that that the guys that go into seal team and
02:14:04.28 --> 02:14:07.60 It's it's got a good point since bad points just like you said commander
02:14:07.60 --> 02:14:14.28 But there are different breed of people and I I really believe that that they can make things happen
02:14:14.28 --> 02:14:22.56 I mean guys you just come out of the blue and say yeah, we're gonna do this and we have this process and it's a legitimate process and
02:14:22.96 --> 02:14:26.72 It works. I mean what a gift from God, you know
02:14:26.92 --> 02:14:30.72 It's a gift from God the way a lot of seal teams
02:14:30.72 --> 02:14:36.96 Sociality they're weird, but you put him in the battle situation. Am I not right?
02:14:36.96 --> 02:14:42.16 You're right socially. There's weird as a day as long. Yeah. Oh, he's coming
02:14:42.16 --> 02:14:43.68 I
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:45.68 I give an example that
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:48.80 We had a metal of honor winner well before he was metal of honor
02:14:49.04 --> 02:14:52.64 The team bar was the trade wins and to go the trade wins at 430
02:14:52.80 --> 02:14:57.80 Get-knoth work and he's see you'd walk in the door and he had to screen in front of the door
02:14:57.80 --> 02:15:04.000 You'd walk in the door see this one guy sitting at the bar you would immediately go down it around the screen go out
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:09.88 Because you know there is gonna be a fight in like 15 minutes, right? And the guy turned out to be a metal of honor winner
02:15:10.16 --> 02:15:11.52 But I mean
02:15:11.52 --> 02:15:17.60 That's the beauty of the team is that we allow people like that to go in and prosper and
02:15:18.16 --> 02:15:22.56 Contribute to the to the effort. I mean that's the beauty
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:25.64 What a wonderful thing give from God
02:15:25.64 --> 02:15:27.64 Yeah
02:15:28.36 --> 02:15:32.84 So you when you got back home from that deployment what came next?
02:15:32.84 --> 02:15:37.20 Well, can I just go a lot? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna talk about the charity for if you would
02:15:37.20 --> 02:15:40.48 Yeah, that's right the charity you ran in Baghdad. I want to talk about that so I
02:15:41.64 --> 02:15:43.64 Always like to support
02:15:43.64 --> 02:15:48.08 The chaplains because they did a lot of good things for a lot of people, right?
02:15:48.08 --> 02:15:53.36 And so I would go talk to the chaplain he happened to be a Catholic chaplain and I said
02:15:53.36 --> 02:15:57.92 Father what what can we what can we do for you? How can we help you?
02:15:58.28 --> 02:16:03.38 He said man we got this we got this orphanage is Christian orphanage run by German nuns
02:16:03.60 --> 02:16:10.000 They had three German nuns in Baghdad and they're constantly being ranked by the locals
02:16:10.44 --> 02:16:14.84 Especially since the war started and we could use a little help on that
02:16:14.84 --> 02:16:20.68 I said what do you need he says well, they really need money? I said really they need money and so
02:16:20.68 --> 02:16:26.80 I went to I went to the morning mayors meeting we had a morning
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:32.28 morning mayors meeting at 10 o'clock and it was every unit on
02:16:32.64 --> 02:16:38.44 Buy-op sent a representative and we would all help each other the most help they ever gave me is
02:16:38.60 --> 02:16:42.38 When the grom needed gasoline because everything else didn't need gasoline
02:16:42.38 --> 02:16:47.14 I got gasoline for the grom. I was able to trade to the grom and
02:16:47.14 --> 02:16:55.06 Then I needed a pair of quadruple E size nine boots now who in God's name?
02:16:55.34 --> 02:17:02.42 Takes a brand new pair of triple or quadruple E size nine boots some guy
02:17:03.82 --> 02:17:09.34 Defoliate at his boot, right and I was able to do that to get that but I was really happy about that
02:17:09.34 --> 02:17:11.34 but that cost me some big
02:17:11.58 --> 02:17:14.58 big things to do that so
02:17:14.58 --> 02:17:16.58 I
02:17:16.58 --> 02:17:23.18 Say okay, I go to the mornings the mayors morning meeting and I said okay after the meeting
02:17:23.18 --> 02:17:26.30 They say anybody can talk right after the mayor. I said okay
02:17:26.30 --> 02:17:33.58 There's 44 seals here in buy-op and we want to challenge the army in a contest
02:17:34.14 --> 02:17:36.82 Anybody's looking at me? Pussy sit down you dumb ass
02:17:37.38 --> 02:17:40.94 Okay, you're stupid. I said yeah, we're gonna we're gonna kick your ass
02:17:40.94 --> 02:17:45.58 Okay, I said we're raising money for this Catholic charity
02:17:46.30 --> 02:17:50.46 Downtown buy-up and we will us 44 guys
02:17:50.46 --> 02:17:55.76 I think there was 12,000 guys at the base there is gonna outraze the United States Army
02:17:56.26 --> 02:17:58.26 Few Marine guys, okay
02:17:58.26 --> 02:18:01.82 We're gonna we're gonna outrage you because these people need money
02:18:02.66 --> 02:18:08.34 And they you dumb ass and I said we're gonna call it and I don't I'm gonna just say the guys first name
02:18:08.34 --> 02:18:15.14 John T. I want to say his last name and I had this jar in my hand this big cookie jar like this
02:18:15.14 --> 02:18:21.82 Clear cookie jar and I had his picture on the front of it with this big lettery the John T. Blank
02:18:23.46 --> 02:18:28.90 Orphan's fun and so I and I had a hole in it where they could stick money, right?
02:18:29.58 --> 02:18:35.82 So people after the meeting says you know my father was an anavie don't let anybody see me put money in this jar
02:18:35.82 --> 02:18:40.46 But I'm gonna put money in this jar and we're gonna get more money for you and I said fine
02:18:40.62 --> 02:18:43.50 So I go to back and I tell our guys
02:18:43.50 --> 02:18:50.90 I said we're in this we're doing this charity thing and we named it after our army Ranger John T and
02:18:52.38 --> 02:18:58.74 He comes up and he says, Posi are you out of your mind? He says I don't I don't help orphans. I make or
02:18:58.74 --> 02:19:05.50 I said you just you just relax big boy. I'm gonna I'm gonna take care of this right so
02:19:06.90 --> 02:19:11.90 We did this for I think 45 days and I would taunt them every morning
02:19:12.42 --> 02:19:16.82 Mayors morning meeting I would taunt them. Oh seal team now has
02:19:18.26 --> 02:19:20.42 10,000 a rocky den R
02:19:20.42 --> 02:19:31.90 What are you guys doing you know what where's the army at and the army rep when we got 300 and so I would taunt them every money and the people just I mean
02:19:33.10 --> 02:19:39.34 They would I would drive my humv down by op and they'd wave at me and come and give me a handful of money
02:19:39.70 --> 02:19:42.86 American dollars, but mainly a rocky den R and
02:19:43.38 --> 02:19:48.50 So finally we ended up with six boxes of money six
02:19:48.50 --> 02:19:57.58 Medium or small boxes of money and then we went to the the nunnery and delivered this money
02:19:57.58 --> 02:20:04.70 So we were afraid that by doing that that we would draw the attention of the rackies that they would come and
02:20:05.06 --> 02:20:09.94 Raid these poor nuns and kill them and do whatever for this money because it was I mean
02:20:09.94 --> 02:20:14.54 I don't know how much money we had but we had a ton of money and so they
02:20:14.54 --> 02:20:20.54 Commander their seal team says okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna do a raid on this
02:20:20.54 --> 02:20:25.22 Nunary and we're gonna be very ugly to them when we go in and we go out
02:20:25.74 --> 02:20:33.02 So that we can protect them, you know, we're gonna act like we're gonna hook them and the kids up and so we did that and so
02:20:33.54 --> 02:20:40.58 I go knock on the door and I talk to this kid and I said I want to deliver something to the nuns and so
02:20:40.58 --> 02:20:46.98 He let me in and I go talk to the nice sister. We have this she barely spoke English
02:20:46.98 --> 02:20:48.98 We have money for you
02:20:48.98 --> 02:20:53.62 Where would you like it and she says oh you can just put her on this little card table they had right there
02:20:53.86 --> 02:21:00.94 So I mentioned to my guys in the Humvee to come in and we were doing TOT because we were really worried about
02:21:01.38 --> 02:21:05.98 Spending too much time there that it was a social call and not you know some kind of a bad call
02:21:05.98 --> 02:21:12.46 And so my guys coming in and they're banging on the door with their gun butts and just being ugly when they go
02:21:12.46 --> 02:21:14.94 We're gonna get you what you did, you know
02:21:14.94 --> 02:21:18.90 They were really good and he's break these six boxes of money and I said
02:21:19.34 --> 02:21:26.42 But that time it was very difficult to find cardboard boxes at buy up it was impossible and I wanted my box is back
02:21:26.42 --> 02:21:28.30 I said where do you want she says right there?
02:21:28.30 --> 02:21:30.94 So we start dumping these boxes of money
02:21:30.94 --> 02:21:38.10 And it was a stack about two feet tall and it's going all over the floor she looks at me and said who are you guys?
02:21:38.10 --> 02:21:42.54 I said well, I don't know where the army right?
02:21:44.18 --> 02:21:49.06 So I said we have we're doing this. She said well, why don't you sit down and have lunch with us?
02:21:49.06 --> 02:21:53.20 We're gonna have lunch and we have Pepsi Cola and I said sister
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:59.18 We're gonna get be out of here in 30 seconds. We just have to make this look ugly because we don't want them to come and
02:21:59.18 --> 02:22:03.82 And give you a bad time and and steal this money from me. She says we understand
02:22:03.98 --> 02:22:11.02 So we're banging our way out, you know, and they're pointing the guns of the nunnery and this whole thing and so we just
02:22:11.18 --> 02:22:13.18 Exfield and so
02:22:14.30 --> 02:22:20.16 That I heard later on that that was really good for him because they were really having a hard time financially
02:22:20.16 --> 02:22:23.06 You know a feeding I think they had 60 kids there
02:22:23.06 --> 02:22:30.02 So it was really good and it was really good because the army really supported us. That's awesome
02:22:30.02 --> 02:22:36.90 That's where the bulk of the money came from obviously and it was really wonderful that they did that so more power to them
02:22:36.90 --> 02:22:42.98 And it's also wonderful that the press didn't pick up any pictures of a young seal holding this weapon aimed at some
02:22:42.98 --> 02:22:44.02 Mom
02:22:44.02 --> 02:22:47.38 That's a five-edited happen. We would do too great with the press
02:22:47.38 --> 02:22:53.06 I know I made her stay in the house and the kid walked me out God because I we were trying to be very cognizant of that
02:22:53.30 --> 02:22:58.26 You know, but we didn't want to leave a trail that they would have problems for sure
02:22:58.26 --> 02:23:02.98 If it looked like they were helping coalition forces that's a deathson. That's right right so
02:23:03.46 --> 02:23:05.46 Good tack that worked out so
02:23:06.18 --> 02:23:10.30 So eventually you though you end up in as you did 30 combat operations
02:23:10.50 --> 02:23:12.50 You saved a bunch of orphans
02:23:12.50 --> 02:23:18.82 I mean this is just bill posed the on the rampage you've supplied the whole seal teams with everything they needed
02:23:18.82 --> 02:23:20.82 We're in a thousand homies
02:23:20.82 --> 02:23:26.98 But but you got to a point where you were too banged up and and you know my funding ran out
02:23:27.62 --> 02:23:32.02 So I was on reserve funding on non-active duty my funding
02:23:32.42 --> 02:23:40.42 I was on active duty, but the funding from the reserves was pain me and so then they told me to come back out and so
02:23:40.42 --> 02:23:46.02 Oh, I thought you got injured you came home because you heard now, but I was hurt, but it didn't bother me
02:23:46.02 --> 02:23:51.38 I mean the bottom I don't know for whatever reason the bottoms my feet were killing me, but that you know what can you do?
02:23:51.94 --> 02:23:53.94 You know
02:23:54.26 --> 02:23:55.94 You got to do what you got to do
02:23:56.42 --> 02:23:57.38 so
02:23:57.38 --> 02:23:59.38 you know that was really a
02:23:59.54 --> 02:24:00.82 good thing and then they sent me
02:24:03.06 --> 02:24:04.58 This is really funny
02:24:04.58 --> 02:24:08.26 well, maybe it's enough money that I come back and I
02:24:08.26 --> 02:24:12.02 This Admiral calls me and he says posey
02:24:12.58 --> 02:24:15.22 No, it wasn't it was an army I mean a Navy captain
02:24:15.78 --> 02:24:18.02 Your funding's ran out you have to go home
02:24:18.98 --> 02:24:21.22 And I said what do you mean I have to go home?
02:24:21.22 --> 02:24:24.98 I'm I'm hurt I got to get fixed you got to fix me. He says no no
02:24:24.98 --> 02:24:26.98 I'm giving you a direct
02:24:26.98 --> 02:24:28.98 order you have to
02:24:30.10 --> 02:24:32.58 You have to disengage yourself and
02:24:33.78 --> 02:24:34.98 So
02:24:34.98 --> 02:24:40.26 This was this when you got back to the states. Yes, it's got back to the states you're being dubbed now you're being dubbed up and you're like hey
02:24:40.58 --> 02:24:45.62 I need to get some medical treatment before I so I look like Chester
02:24:46.90 --> 02:24:51.94 I'm going and get one of these right and I said you guys got a fix me
02:24:53.46 --> 02:24:57.46 And so he says no I'm giving you direct order you have to report in to the
02:24:58.34 --> 02:25:02.26 Exfield tomorrow and get out and I said okay
02:25:02.26 --> 02:25:05.22 So I go of course a worn officer
02:25:05.78 --> 02:25:07.30 I mean
02:25:07.30 --> 02:25:10.10 Not that we're brilliant, but we know how the Navy works
02:25:10.10 --> 02:25:16.58 We know how the whole thing works and there's chapter and verse on any given situation
02:25:16.82 --> 02:25:18.94 So I go to the instruction you know
02:25:18.94 --> 02:25:24.90 1 0 0 3 3 1 and I look at it and I pull the instruction out and I
02:25:26.26 --> 02:25:29.86 Talk to the captain the next day and I said captain
02:25:29.86 --> 02:25:36.82 Did you know about instruction 1 0 0 3 1 and he says no I don't but I don't care what it is
02:25:36.90 --> 02:25:42.42 You will report to this afternoon at 12. I said no I won't I'm not being the restory, Sir
02:25:42.42 --> 02:25:44.42 I talked to my command
02:25:44.98 --> 02:25:49.46 They stand behind me and that you guys have to fix me and you can't send me home
02:25:50.02 --> 02:25:53.22 And he says we'll we'll see about that so I
02:25:53.62 --> 02:25:56.90 Immediately I left there and I went to talk to my congressman
02:25:56.90 --> 02:26:02.98 Who I knew because I was doing things and I said you know I'm not being really respectful
02:26:02.98 --> 02:26:08.34 I love the Navy. I'm not disrespectful. I'm not that kind of guy. I'm not a you know
02:26:08.82 --> 02:26:16.26 Seaboard lawyer but you have to fix me and I was at the clinic every day and I knew all these kids that there are mustard now
02:26:16.26 --> 02:26:17.86 I mean an E3
02:26:18.26 --> 02:26:22.58 Marine Corps guy mustering out there send in him home and he can't even walk
02:26:22.58 --> 02:26:29.14 I mean he can't do anything right and they send I think 60 of those people home and so
02:26:29.86 --> 02:26:32.74 I go to my congressman. I said sir you got to help me
02:26:33.06 --> 02:26:35.70 I mean this is not right what they're doing to all these kids
02:26:35.70 --> 02:26:39.46 I can get along I can make it happen right because I can go to the VA or whatever
02:26:40.26 --> 02:26:42.58 But it's not right what you're doing to these kids
02:26:43.06 --> 02:26:46.26 So he calls the admiral and they strained it out
02:26:46.42 --> 02:26:51.62 So I'm in six months of rehab and I went to the clinic there that we have in the seal team
02:26:51.62 --> 02:26:57.86 And they really helped me so I was really happy about what was going on there and you know then
02:26:58.82 --> 02:27:01.46 My time was up and I went home so it was good
02:27:04.26 --> 02:27:06.26 What did you do when you went home?
02:27:10.66 --> 02:27:12.66 I started flipping houses again
02:27:13.06 --> 02:27:19.30 So I'm good at carpentry and that kind of stuff and flipping houses and then I moved to Texas and
02:27:19.30 --> 02:27:23.46 I worked for the I was working an oil field for a while
02:27:24.02 --> 02:27:26.02 as a service
02:27:26.02 --> 02:27:30.18 Component of the oil field and then I got the job teaching school
02:27:30.58 --> 02:27:33.46 How's you end up in the job teaching school? What major decided to do that?
02:27:33.46 --> 02:27:37.86 Because I couldn't do the oil field job my back. I didn't know my back was broken right?
02:27:38.34 --> 02:27:43.70 I didn't know I was just having all these back problems and feet problems and I thought it was just old age
02:27:43.86 --> 02:27:47.38 Of course we all get old right. I mean you guys are even feeling it
02:27:47.38 --> 02:27:49.38 25
02:27:49.38 --> 02:27:51.38 26
02:27:51.38 --> 02:27:53.38 Okay
02:27:54.02 --> 02:27:58.42 But you know and so I had to quit that oil field job and
02:27:59.94 --> 02:28:08.18 And I found this teaching job through this part of our church has his high school and so the guy calls me in and he says
02:28:08.74 --> 02:28:13.14 You know you'd ever taught before and you only have a college degree, but you don't have a teacher credential
02:28:13.62 --> 02:28:15.62 you know, but
02:28:15.62 --> 02:28:22.26 Maybe we can help you so they hired me. I was lucky enough to they hired me and so that was really for the last eight years
02:28:22.26 --> 02:28:24.26 Been a really good gig for me
02:28:24.82 --> 02:28:27.22 My objective there is to have
02:28:28.10 --> 02:28:33.06 Those kids not make the same mistakes that I've made. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life
02:28:33.78 --> 02:28:36.66 You know and I did a lot of stupid things
02:28:37.46 --> 02:28:39.46 So what's subject to you teach?
02:28:39.46 --> 02:28:44.10 History government economics and art and Bible
02:28:45.46 --> 02:28:50.90 But it's a wide range. Yeah, but it's a you know, it's a small school so you do everything
02:28:51.38 --> 02:28:55.06 You know, we only have like 175 kids in rural in the high school
02:28:56.02 --> 02:29:00.42 How do you seeing are you getting feedback from kids that graduated four years ago six years ago?
02:29:00.42 --> 02:29:02.42 years ago that you had an impact on
02:29:03.70 --> 02:29:05.70 Yeah
02:29:05.70 --> 02:29:10.50 Yeah, I think so. I mean they tell me you know, we really loved your class whatever
02:29:11.06 --> 02:29:14.42 Because I tell you know the problem at least my perception
02:29:14.98 --> 02:29:20.82 I'm probably speaking out of turn, but the problem is they treat the kids like kids
02:29:21.22 --> 02:29:24.50 You know how many in world war two even in Vietnam
02:29:25.22 --> 02:29:28.26 You had these guys. They were 16 and 17 years old
02:29:28.66 --> 02:29:33.38 You know going to the war. I mean in world war two full geod
02:29:33.38 --> 02:29:36.66 Go on under the war right going to the war
02:29:38.10 --> 02:29:44.10 You know against the German super power and we say these kids are kids when they're 18 years old
02:29:44.18 --> 02:29:46.18 They're not kids they're adults
02:29:46.18 --> 02:29:52.58 Don't baby him so I try not to baby now. I just give it to him straight. You know this is this is what's really happening
02:29:52.58 --> 02:29:54.58 You know think you know
02:29:54.58 --> 02:29:59.22 my objective read right be able to present your stealth
02:29:59.22 --> 02:30:01.22 Uh
02:30:02.42 --> 02:30:05.78 Think and then act. I mean if you can think you're dangerous
02:30:06.34 --> 02:30:09.62 Right? You're dangerous you're full on dangerous
02:30:10.58 --> 02:30:15.54 Because I don't think a lot of the schools now want you to think it's not a good thing
02:30:18.42 --> 02:30:22.74 And then what you also apparently now you're you have your own radio show I do
02:30:23.22 --> 02:30:26.42 So what's that all about how can we listen to that? Oh, yeah, I don't think you want to
02:30:26.42 --> 02:30:35.30 Commander I just have this little we do we talk politics every morning from 630 to 7 on 95.9
02:30:35.78 --> 02:30:37.46 on no radio
02:30:37.46 --> 02:30:39.46 Victoria Texas and
02:30:40.18 --> 02:30:45.46 We talk about things that are going on and especially things that are going on on the Republican party and
02:30:47.22 --> 02:30:51.86 How we can you know fight back from what we think has
02:30:51.86 --> 02:30:58.58 Not been well for us in the past here especially the past couple years and how old are you right now?
02:30:58.98 --> 02:31:02.18 I'm gonna be 75 and six months. Is there any
02:31:02.66 --> 02:31:07.14 Part of your brain that thinks maybe you're gonna you know retire and sit on the front porch and
02:31:07.62 --> 02:31:12.58 Drink coffee in the morning and watch the grass grow you know the problem is I really hate old people
02:31:13.14 --> 02:31:16.18 I hate old people and I don't want to be associated
02:31:16.18 --> 02:31:18.98 I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to do anything with old people
02:31:18.98 --> 02:31:26.10 So I really find it you know when you're kid and you have every possibility in the world out there
02:31:26.50 --> 02:31:32.34 Every possibility that you can do anything you want right you can do whatever you want
02:31:32.82 --> 02:31:37.86 What a wonderful time in life right instead of some 70 oh my back my side
02:31:37.86 --> 02:31:43.62 I mean they all want to talk about their operations. I don't give a rats ass about their operations
02:31:44.18 --> 02:31:46.18 right I don't care
02:31:46.18 --> 02:31:53.54 So I like dealing with interfacing with the kids and you know trying to give it you know
02:31:53.54 --> 02:31:55.54 I don't think it's a
02:31:55.70 --> 02:31:58.02 Not in doctor well maybe it is in doctor nation
02:31:58.02 --> 02:32:05.38 But I'm really big on the constitution the declaration of independence of the things that your grandfather my father
02:32:05.86 --> 02:32:11.22 Your great grandfather did for America. I mean let's honor those people. I mean especially like
02:32:11.94 --> 02:32:15.30 Memorial day today. Let's honor those folks and
02:32:15.30 --> 02:32:22.42 Thank them for all the wonderful things and allowing it's to have the wonderful things that we have in this nation
02:32:22.42 --> 02:32:27.86 You know so that's my objective you know teaching school. I am slowing down
02:32:28.58 --> 02:32:29.86 COVID
02:32:30.34 --> 02:32:31.86 Was really
02:32:31.86 --> 02:32:38.10 Mentally hard on me and so I hope I don't lose my mind here in the next three years because I hope to teach for the next three years
02:32:38.10 --> 02:32:46.42 Well, tell you what that's a freaking about as good of a closing as we could ever hope for here echo you got anything
02:32:47.46 --> 02:32:53.06 Usually if you have a listen well you've listened to podcast so echo you know speaking you're talking about some weird social things
02:32:53.38 --> 02:32:57.86 Sometimes echo throws out some weird social questions right now. We don't know what's coming up the actually
02:32:58.42 --> 02:33:03.54 More for clarity than anything back to Apollo 12. What's your job there? Well like what was you?
02:33:03.54 --> 02:33:11.46 I was the first man out the door so I would hook the slow down parachute to the side and then we would put the capsule the
02:33:12.18 --> 02:33:14.18 color around the capsule
02:33:14.18 --> 02:33:16.90 then our decontamination because we thought there was moonbooks
02:33:18.10 --> 02:33:26.34 The decontamination rafts would be inflated put it on the side we'd hope the decontamination man would open the door and
02:33:27.38 --> 02:33:29.46 Put the astronauts in the
02:33:29.46 --> 02:33:34.02 rafts and then they would go up in the in the helicopter just just to go a little bit further
02:33:34.02 --> 02:33:40.50 I think I got to take it back one step so you remember you seen the the the capsule splashing down into the ocean the
02:33:40.50 --> 02:33:46.50 capsule from the from from the rock it yeah like it goes to the moon whatever it goes up into space
02:33:46.82 --> 02:33:49.46 And then to get back it just splashes down in the middle of the ocean
02:33:50.10 --> 02:33:55.70 So somebody's got to go recover that capsule get those astronauts out. Yeah, that's someone UDT
02:33:55.70 --> 02:34:02.18 That's someone built-in hot first guy out the door of the helicopter of the helicopter
02:34:02.18 --> 02:34:05.46 So the helicopter and actually if you go to the USS midway

02:37:27.38 --> 02:37:28.58 He was like oh

02:38:24.66 --> 02:38:29.38 But when last I'm about retirees like I don't like old people
02:38:30.02 --> 02:38:32.02 What a freaking epic answer
02:38:32.90 --> 02:38:34.50 75 years old
02:38:34.50 --> 02:38:36.50 Whatever he's like what?
02:38:36.50 --> 02:38:42.90 No, I got stuff I'm gonna do I'm out here making stuff happen. I started a radio program by the way
02:38:42.90 --> 02:38:44.90 It's gonna true when he's talking about the
02:38:45.46 --> 02:38:49.86 Like old people talk about their operations. Yeah, he's not talking about his operation
02:38:49.86 --> 02:38:52.18 He's talking about going I rack
02:38:52.98 --> 02:38:58.18 He said one one little thing that he said that stood out to me when he was like oh, yeah
02:38:58.18 --> 02:39:03.38 They throw you over the over the deck or whatever in the water and to see if you're clustered
02:39:03.38 --> 02:39:08.34 Oh, yeah, the casual way that he said that was like oh, they just want to see if he's clustered
02:39:08.34 --> 02:39:13.14 You know what the suit that he's talking about I'm assuming it's the old school with that big ass
02:39:13.14 --> 02:39:16.58 Man like 20,000 weeks into the sea scenario
02:39:17.22 --> 02:39:21.06 You don't know say a clustered phobic uh in the bottom of the
02:39:21.86 --> 02:39:22.90 Bay
02:39:22.90 --> 02:39:29.22 Yeah, that seems like a way bigger deal than his tone was when he said it seems like not a lot of stuff was a big deal
02:39:29.78 --> 02:39:36.02 He was just jumping out of helicopters hooking in Apollo 12 going on patrol with with 30
02:39:36.02 --> 02:39:43.38 Oh, by the way dropping danger close napa and then they pull up that luckily happen to be there as you were about to get overrun

02:41:08.58 --> 02:41:13.86 That's like the witch test that's like the witch test before you in the water and if you drown
02:41:14.66 --> 02:41:16.66 Then that means you're not a witch
02:41:16.66 --> 02:41:21.30 But if you survive means you're a witch and we're gonna kill you check this out. We want to see

02:41:54.42 --> 02:41:56.10 This is brutal all right well
02:41:56.82 --> 02:42:00.74 So speaking of staying in the game long term, which is what we're looking to do yes
02:42:00.98 --> 02:42:02.98 How can we stay in the game longer?
02:42:02.98 --> 02:42:05.54 What will pose these dial okay? We want to keep ourselves capable
02:42:05.94 --> 02:42:07.94 capable
02:42:07.94 --> 02:42:11.54 in every way physical mental emotional spiritual
02:42:12.42 --> 02:42:14.42 Social
02:42:14.42 --> 02:42:20.42 When do we start throwing social into this part of life? Okay for don't keep that one for oh you need like you need
02:42:20.42 --> 02:42:26.10 Robust relationships you do. I'm not robust. We'll just say healthy relationships. I'm about that
02:42:26.98 --> 02:42:31.54 Either way we're in talk boxes of the physical and mental so you you want to be exercising
02:42:31.54 --> 02:42:37.54 We want to be exercising we want to be doing Gitu we want to be eating well. Here's the thing with eating well
02:42:39.22 --> 02:42:42.42 It's really hard to get all
02:42:43.22 --> 02:42:48.10 The nutrients that you need okay it's hard for oh yeah agreed
02:42:48.10 --> 02:42:52.34 Yeah, even if you have a perfect diet in real life
02:42:52.66 --> 02:42:56.66 Which no one does? It's most interesting well maybe there's some free y'know like
02:42:57.22 --> 02:43:04.10 Hollywood whatever that's up there that has like the personal chef and it has the person coming in with them
02:43:04.66 --> 02:43:06.66 You know plucking the kale from
02:43:07.38 --> 02:43:13.22 Fucking the kale from you know northern Bulgaria where it's grown without any
02:43:13.22 --> 02:43:21.46 Interference from man and then I've deemed for like you know like 38 points
02:43:21.46 --> 02:43:24.02 Yeah at 17 degrees
02:43:25.62 --> 02:43:30.58 Exactly so that person might have a perfect diet no but and even then but even then
02:43:30.58 --> 02:43:34.50 Unless they don't have a job all that's what I'm saying those people up in Hollywood they don't have a job
02:43:34.50 --> 02:43:36.50 Yeah, they just sit there. Yeah
02:43:36.50 --> 02:43:40.42 Don't do anything no offense to my people and Hollywood come on. Let's get real
02:43:40.42 --> 02:43:45.06 What about though you know it's really hard being on the set all day shut up
02:43:46.02 --> 02:43:51.62 Bill Polzzy was getting thrown over a boat with a freaking hard hat helmet on to wander around in the
02:43:51.62 --> 02:43:58.10 Muck that's been there for 150 years that was hard. Yeah, that's hard. Yes, for being on set no you get zero credit

02:44:03.62 --> 02:44:05.62 We didn't got out of the water
02:44:05.62 --> 02:44:16.34 Negative so even if you either go with that where we don't have a fresh Bulgarian kale salad and everything else perfect balanced meals
02:44:17.14 --> 02:44:20.02 In whatever way you're balancing them because we're all different in a lot of ways

02:46:35.30 --> 02:46:37.30 In these times we're not
02:46:37.86 --> 02:46:42.10 Sometimes our immune system sometimes it needs a little attention extra attention
02:46:42.90 --> 02:46:46.10 That's it. It's a good call. It's true. We just got back from a trip
02:46:46.10 --> 02:46:51.46 And that's sometimes that's the time where you mean system gonna need a little little spot sometimes
02:46:51.94 --> 02:46:53.94 So yeah, you got to you got the cold war
02:46:56.58 --> 02:46:58.58 From juggle fuel also

02:47:05.22 --> 02:47:06.58 So ridiculous
02:47:06.58 --> 02:47:11.46 We we you got to the month we just got done with a monster and I don't know why I asked Jamie this
02:47:11.46 --> 02:47:17.54 I got paranoid but I was like I was about to fly out and she was out there before getting everything set up and I text her
02:47:17.54 --> 02:47:22.18 I was like, hey, do we have milk out there and she's like are you serious? Of course we have milk
02:47:22.18 --> 02:47:23.62 We have pretty much
02:47:23.62 --> 02:47:27.78 Dude I was out there just just taking because they bought my so beautiful
02:47:27.78 --> 02:47:32.10 I showed up they got a refrigerator in my room. There's milk in the refrigerator

02:47:35.06 --> 02:47:41.14 They back oh yeah, yeah, no, no, it feels so yeah, so I get there and there's milk and then there's milk and
02:47:41.70 --> 02:47:47.86 I was just with this what I was doing I was taking like opening up the milk bottle and just drinking a little bit of milk and pouring milk and they're
02:47:47.86 --> 02:47:52.42 Enchaking it. It was so freaking good to go. It looks such a game changer
02:47:52.82 --> 02:47:55.78 You're on the road and you're you're just eating clean
02:47:56.82 --> 02:47:59.70 So legit get yourself some milk and by the way right now
02:47:59.70 --> 02:48:05.62 I've been on peanut butter the chocolate peanut butter cup for like probably a month right now and I got everything
02:48:05.62 --> 02:48:10.26 I started looking at my cupboard and I'm like thinking could it be make could it be meant could it be strawberry?
02:48:10.42 --> 02:48:13.06 Maybe a little vanilla green though and I just keep for the past month
02:48:13.06 --> 02:48:18.26 I've been grabbing that grabbing that chocolate peanut butter. It's a racist peanut butter milkshake
02:48:18.82 --> 02:48:22.98 It's that freaking good. Yep, same boat same ball studio there
02:48:23.70 --> 02:48:26.74 All right, so one of the
02:48:26.74 --> 02:48:32.58 One of our people at the mustard was thanking me for whatever reason for the
02:48:33.78 --> 02:48:40.18 Mulk the raw milk or the one the nonflavor yeah, thank you for that. I told him hey man you're welcome
02:48:40.18 --> 02:48:42.18 This won't problem for me
02:48:42.18 --> 02:48:44.18 To get that out

02:48:50.82 --> 02:48:56.18 So that's a good that's an interesting one though so if like yeah if you don't prefer like a
02:48:56.18 --> 02:49:01.94 Flavor necessarily I mean it's kind of hard to imagine but hey man everybody's different
02:49:01.94 --> 02:49:04.66 Man got that option is there a banana thing
02:49:05.46 --> 02:49:11.78 Flavor coming up banana banana is coming a banana milk. I've obviously have you had it have you had the new no

02:49:25.38 --> 02:49:32.90 Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous again you feel like you you feel like you're having a dessert straight up like that

02:49:36.50 --> 02:49:42.50 yesterday I had mint which was good. It's kind of like it's essentially a cheat code
02:49:42.74 --> 02:49:46.90 It's one of those cheat codes all right we need to move on. I started to feel like wearing this weird
02:49:46.90 --> 02:49:51.46 Dange and we're all we're like yeah, you know why cuz you're imagining
02:49:51.46 --> 02:49:55.30 Drink yeah, I know I understand but so yeah, so get it for yourself how about that?
02:49:55.86 --> 02:50:02.82 Get it at jockelfuel.com and get all this stuff you can get um we have a drink too by the way of beverage
02:50:04.26 --> 02:50:07.54 When I was in Florida we at the monster we we
02:50:08.42 --> 02:50:12.66 supplied we'll say our people with the dism ago and
02:50:13.46 --> 02:50:19.30 Man so good to go so good to go and then went to wall wall down there in Florida
02:50:19.30 --> 02:50:22.26 Which is pretty freaking cool going in a wall wall
02:50:22.90 --> 02:50:27.54 Walk to the fridge there you go you can just there you go it's like a hidden wall wall
02:50:28.42 --> 02:50:33.86 Well, let's up with that cool here's the thing right now. There's people like oh we're making a healthy energy drink
02:50:34.26 --> 02:50:35.46 Bullshit
02:50:35.46 --> 02:50:36.74 You're actually lying
02:50:36.74 --> 02:50:41.62 Well, there's only one person that's making a a healthy energy drink right now us we are
02:50:42.18 --> 02:50:46.58 I guess there's only one team that's making a healthy energy drink right now
02:50:46.58 --> 02:50:52.18 There's only one team that said you know what we're not gonna put a bunch of freaking chemicals in here to preserve this that are gonna go in your body and
02:50:52.34 --> 02:50:54.34 Preserve your body in some weird way
02:50:54.50 --> 02:50:58.50 That's what you do when you die you go to a mortician and they preserve your body
02:50:58.50 --> 02:51:04.50 Yeah, they put those chemicals into the drink and say oh it's cool. It's good drink it. No, we didn't do that we pasteurize it
02:51:04.98 --> 02:51:10.42 We pasteurize this when we have to add any of those chemicals look at you know it almost I almost got
02:51:10.90 --> 02:51:14.42 What's got some some guy commented on some
02:51:14.42 --> 02:51:18.42 Social maybe a thing use like all this
02:51:19.22 --> 02:51:25.30 You know just to standard he's trying up there he me trying a pitch you know some
02:51:26.74 --> 02:51:32.18 You know some supplement same is everything else it's actually literally not the same as everything else
02:51:32.58 --> 02:51:37.22 All you have to do is look at the ingredients and you realize oh it's actually not it's unhooked close to everything else
02:51:37.22 --> 02:51:41.70 Not even close. It's a totally different ball game. Yeah, so if you're thinking that you're wrong
02:51:41.70 --> 02:51:48.10 You kind of I mean, you know, I try to get people the benefit of the doubt and you can kind of
02:51:48.34 --> 02:51:53.46 Understand because when you think about it try to exclude you exclude yourself in what what this whole
02:51:54.50 --> 02:51:56.50 Discipline go thing exclude that
02:51:56.50 --> 02:52:02.66 What's on not a part of it pretend it doesn't exist. Oh, but that the drink doesn't exist. Yeah, okay, and let's say even you don't exist
02:52:03.38 --> 02:52:05.38 He has a point
02:52:05.38 --> 02:52:11.78 That guy saying oh, it's just like everything you know it's like everyone everything else or whatever, you know like oh, yeah
02:52:11.78 --> 02:52:16.58 Just some peddling some you know whatever he has no idea. He's he's the thing is he's right
02:52:17.46 --> 02:52:24.42 Except now he's not right because you're not but everyone else kind of does that you should say so if I didn't exist as a human
02:52:24.42 --> 02:52:29.38 Yes, this guy would be correct. Was be correct. Yes, so you kind of like if he don't know he just decayed
02:52:29.38 --> 02:52:32.10 You know decayed means no, didn't know oh
02:52:32.10 --> 02:52:38.82 Oh, so if you didn't you know how you don't you know you did you got you get decayed a lot actually people don't know me they just don't know
02:52:38.82 --> 02:52:40.34 Yeah, they're just like oh look at that
02:52:40.34 --> 02:52:45.06 Yeah, just assume yeah, yeah, they just assume like everyone else like remember that time about the warrior kid book
02:52:45.62 --> 02:52:47.90 Like I'm glad or back in the day some
02:52:48.90 --> 02:52:54.34 Chimed in yeah, like so I forget who posted it, but someone posted something saying oh yeah, like um, you know
02:52:55.38 --> 02:53:00.34 Where the where kid from Wimpy to warrior the name is you win whatever and some
02:53:00.34 --> 02:53:06.90 Professor or something was like oh just another guy pedaling toxic masculinity or something like this
02:53:06.90 --> 02:53:09.54 Amazing to see some comment and it goes a
02:53:10.26 --> 02:53:14.82 Sorry all past right like didn't read it look it did it on the quote. Yeah, yeah, you know
02:53:14.82 --> 02:53:18.98 Didn't look into the whole thing and everyone just piled up on him saying hey essentially
02:53:19.14 --> 02:53:20.74 Write your decaying this guy
02:53:20.74 --> 02:53:25.22 It's not that it's like whatever my daughter's read it like that kind and he was like oh
02:53:25.78 --> 02:53:28.02 Backpilling winter, but totally decayed you
02:53:28.02 --> 02:53:30.02 Hmm, so you know it's just another decayed
02:53:30.02 --> 02:53:34.66 It's weird though that someone would make that move like like like let's face it
02:53:34.74 --> 02:53:38.62 What's a good lesson alone when you're a kid that almost everybody learns don't judge a book by its cover
02:53:38.62 --> 02:53:40.22 Almost everybody
02:53:40.22 --> 02:53:45.06 Does it learns that lesson and here's a guy that double violated that number one
02:53:45.46 --> 02:53:50.54 Looking at me and judging the book by its cover and the number two straight up judge the book by its cover
02:53:50.54 --> 02:53:54.02 Straight up literally doing that and this guy's a professor
02:53:54.02 --> 02:53:58.74 Who's you know a liberal guy because I was seeing a who is this guy?
02:53:58.74 --> 02:54:04.26 He's some super liberal guy look I got all kinds of liberal people that read the books no factor
02:54:04.26 --> 02:54:08.30 They're like oh yeah, this guy's no per mind cool just decade me yeah
02:54:09.14 --> 02:54:13.38 Twice it but even worse broke the act broke the broke the
02:54:13.94 --> 02:54:19.34 Metaphorical room and broke the straight up real literal rule broken right there for two
02:54:19.34 --> 02:54:24.94 Elz and his column right loser loser double up. Yeah, yeah, fully and yeah
02:54:24.94 --> 02:54:30.18 Being liberal or not liberal that wasn't in this case the violation it was a mean
02:54:30.18 --> 02:54:34.66 Who cares if you was a super liberal guy that read the book and was like hey
02:54:34.66 --> 02:54:40.30 I think that the way you portray XYZ I'd be like okay cool. Yeah, that's good good feedback. I need to pay attention to that
02:54:42.30 --> 02:54:45.50 So yeah, so yeah, look so for future reference
02:54:45.50 --> 02:54:51.38 You will get decayed in the future as well and this energy drink situation. He just decadious
02:54:51.38 --> 02:54:54.66 So good. Yeah, look at the the ingredients are
02:54:55.50 --> 02:55:00.94 filtered carbonated water natural flavor citric acid monk fruit extract
02:55:02.30 --> 02:55:09.02 That's the that's ingredients now look are there there are other ingredients that are like the supplement part
02:55:09.30 --> 02:55:12.10 Vitamin B12 vitamin B6
02:55:12.10 --> 02:55:17.90 Like caffeine alpha GPC like those are real ingredients that are in there, but they're
02:55:18.62 --> 02:55:23.70 Supplemental they're good for you. Yeah, the bat where's the bat for you ingredients on here? There are no
02:55:25.22 --> 02:55:31.48 That's the way they should do like that should be the new labeling system right? What there should be two columns good for you bad for you
02:55:33.10 --> 02:55:37.02 See come a reality if it's too much reality, but that's the way it should be because people don't know
02:55:37.02 --> 02:55:42.06 People don't know that that that all those chemicals that are getting put in there they should be in the bat for you column
02:55:42.30 --> 02:55:47.54 Yeah, by the way. Yeah, kind of like cigarettes. Yeah, that'll cigarettes. They say hey you can get cancer
02:55:48.82 --> 02:55:53.56 Then they should just have one column that says this left side makes you strong right side makes you weak

02:57:59.16 --> 02:58:03.40 We're not worried about them because it's rivets and we need them. Yeah, that's the easy thing to do
02:58:03.40 --> 02:58:06.04 But we have most of the jeans made in America
02:58:06.36 --> 02:58:11.24 we look most of our stuff is made by Americans that are actually
02:58:11.24 --> 02:58:13.24 Actually
02:58:13.24 --> 02:58:15.24 Enjoying their job
02:58:15.24 --> 02:58:21.24 We got most of our parts not made by slave labor. That's kind of cool right now. It's actually not cool
02:58:21.80 --> 02:58:26.60 That's actually a good point like how you're like the rivets. They seem small. They say it's small
02:58:26.60 --> 02:58:30.40 So it's it kind of mirrors it's a well-veiled kid getting fucking big

03:02:58.98 --> 03:03:03.86 Yeah, you're the one who did this where if you have a moment of weakness and you get past it
03:03:03.86 --> 03:03:08.70 You've got to punish yourself for having the moment of weakness. You got to add on what do you add like a set or a
03:03:08.70 --> 03:03:09.66 10%
03:03:09.66 --> 03:03:10.66 10%
03:03:10.66 --> 03:03:11.66 40%
03:03:11.66 --> 03:03:13.66 Could be star of yourself for 14 hours
03:03:14.66 --> 03:03:19.70 But somebody got to pay for that. I'm a little shocked at you because jockel jockel cookies were good to go
03:03:19.70 --> 03:03:23.98 And I'm fasting tomorrow. What you got to pay for that and yes, so man
03:03:25.14 --> 03:03:26.50 What was the moment? I
03:03:26.98 --> 03:03:31.58 Want to skip the workout actually I want to skip it. I was into it. I warmed up
03:03:31.58 --> 03:03:33.98 You know the kind where it's like hey if I just start warming up
03:03:33.98 --> 03:03:39.18 I'm gonna be in the workout. Yeah, it was harder than that the moment of weakness was bigger and more robust than that
03:03:39.18 --> 03:03:40.22 I warmed up
03:03:40.22 --> 03:03:43.70 I did like two good sets and I was like kind of like hey
03:03:43.70 --> 03:03:45.94 I did those two solid sets right there
03:03:46.78 --> 03:03:52.46 So if I don't do the second half of this workout we kind of I can just finish these set and be done
03:03:52.46 --> 03:03:53.50 You know
03:03:53.50 --> 03:03:59.38 So I was like oh man, so I got through it. I said ah, no, I didn't I did the whole workout and then as a punishment
03:03:59.38 --> 03:04:04.02 I had to do a metcon. There you're gonna double up on the metcon today. Yeah check
