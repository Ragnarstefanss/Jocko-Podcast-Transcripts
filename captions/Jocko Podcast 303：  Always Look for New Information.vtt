00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocopontcast number 303 with Carrie Helden and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, Carrie.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Good evening. Also, joining us tonight is Dave Burke, Good evening, Dave.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So Dave, I've been sitting on this for a while, sitting on this book for a while.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I think I've been sitting on it for almost a year, almost a year I've been sitting on this book.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I've been waiting for the right time to cover this book. And I don't think there's a better time than right now.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The reason that I don't think there's a better time than right now, you'll figure out, as soon as I say, the title of the book.

7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The title of the book is on the psychology of military incompetence.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And what does that mean? Well, one thing it means is, as we look at military leaders, a lot of times people think, oh, this individual isn't a military, they must be awesome.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I mean, it happens 100% in the SEAL community. Oh, this guy was a SEAL, he must be of the highest character, must be an unbelievable leader, must be a great runner.

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Right? Must be great at pull ups and swimming must be the best shot. Right? So, so people make assumptions about the SEAL teams. Oh, if you were sealed, then you must be able to survive at a minimum of 78 days with, you know, nothing but a loincloth and a toothpick.

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That's kind of, you're picking up what I'm putting down, right? Same thing happens with leadership. You think, oh, this individual isn't in the military, they made life and death decisions. They must be incredible leaders.

12
00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And we can also attribute that to leaders in the past too. Well, this person was a general, this person was, you know, a military leader in the 1800s and the 1600s, they must have military brilliance.

13
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Well, this book disputes that not whole, not not as a whole. And he makes it very important point.

14
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And I had this discussion with Jason Gardner the other day after the Afghanistan podcast, Jason's like, well, there's a lot of good leaders, nice to have you there and I've worked for a lot of incredible leaders in the military.

15
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:55.000
But to blank it all leaders in the military and say, oh, they're in the military. So they're awesome is a bad move. And you can actually say throughout history, there have been some really bad leaders and it's relatively consistent that you get bad military leaders, bad senior military leaders. So this is something I was interested in. This book is written by a guy named Dr Norman F. Dixon.

16
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I don't really remember where I originally heard about the book. It might have been one of the like, Algarith Nick recommendations which

17
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Do we hate the algorithm kind of, but sometimes we're a little bit stoked about the algorithm. So I might have been an algorithm. It might have been maybe somebody recommended it to me.

18
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But I look at it. And obviously I like the military. That's what this podcast is. We do all kinds of military subjects on this podcast. Obviously I like psychology as well. And the much of the jockel underground podcast. We've covered a bunch of psychology.

19
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But when it comes to military stuff, I like military books that are written by military people, not books that are written by theorist or even historians and academics that haven't been there. So I don't normally like those kind of military books that are written by someone that wasn't a military.

20
00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So I wasn't sure if this book would make the great. Then I did some research and here's the deal. The author Dr Norman Dixon MBE, which is British like thing.

21
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Most excellent order of British Empire, which you're given for your achievements in the arts and sciences. He received his doctrine philosophy in 1956. Dr. Science 1972, 1976 he was awarded.

22
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Sorry, 1956, I say 1956, Dr. Nphilosophy, 1956, Dr. Nphilosophy. Dr. Science 1972, 1976 awarded the University of London Carpenter Medal for Coorcov exceptional distinction in experimental psychology.

23
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:50.78
So the guy has some cloud bringing home some hardware. He's bringing home some hardware. He's a professor, a meritist at of psychology at the University of University of

24
00:04:50.78 --> 00:05:04.78
London. Author to other books besides this one, once called our own worst enemy, got to like that title, another one called unconscious processing another one called subliminal perception. So that's all impressive.

25
00:05:04.78 --> 00:05:20.78
He wasn't sure if it made the great, but what tied it all together for me is that prior to all the stuff that he did, he was in the British Army from 1940 till 1950 and that means he fought World War II was wounded in World War II wounded.

26
00:05:20.78 --> 00:05:43.78
This is according to him, he was wounded, called largely through my own incompetence, which is we're coming out of the gate with some humility, which is nice, but it gives it means his perspective is he has that perspective of a soldier of someone that's fought, of someone that's been in combat, then he can overlay that on his academic knowledge.

27
00:05:43.78 --> 00:05:57.78
But the book is, I mean, you're going to see real quick that this book is pretty incredible book and I don't know how many podcasts we'll do on it. I'm assuming it'll be two maybe three.

28
00:05:57.78 --> 00:06:14.78
I don't know how much we'll even be able to get through today, but with that, I'm going to start off with the forward of the book, which is written by a guy named Jeffrey Wawro, hope I'm saying that right, if not, I apologize to Jeffrey Wawro.

29
00:06:14.78 --> 00:06:37.78
Professor of Military History University of North Texas director of their military history center, and this is his, his forward to the book, which the reason I wanted to read the forward is because it starts to lay out the themes inside this book and you start to get an understanding of where this guy's coming from.

30
00:06:37.78 --> 00:06:46.78
Anything? Makes sense so far. This is a book that I was burning through highlighters.

31
00:06:46.78 --> 00:06:53.78
It's almost one of the books where you might as well just stop highlighting because you're highlighting everything. So here we go.

32
00:06:53.78 --> 00:07:14.78
The forward to normed, Dixon's on the psychology of military incompetence. Norman Dixon's on the psychology of military incompetence is a classic that should be read not because it is true in every detail, but because it offers the military historian analyst or student and important method to discover and rank the manifold reason for military error and defeat.

33
00:07:14.78 --> 00:07:25.78
That's a bold statement coming out of the gate. What he's saying, the manifold reasons for military error and defeat are found in this book coming out of the gate strong.

34
00:07:25.78 --> 00:07:34.78
And there's a couple notes in there, not true in every detail. The reason for that is the way the book is laid out. It covers a lot of historical battles and wars.

35
00:07:34.78 --> 00:07:48.78
And I think that Dixon was sensitive being an academic about the way historians would read it. Well actually, a date is wrong. And so he covers that himself to and says, look.

36
00:07:48.78 --> 00:08:08.78
Ballpark where in there, this is what happened. It's not an adding going fact check everything, but ballpark, this is what happened. So it's not a historical reference. And he says that later, continuing on Dixon just deployed psychological theory in a lucid accessible way and applies it in several case studies spanning the 19th century and 20th centuries.

37
00:08:08.78 --> 00:08:20.78
He is in some ways constrained by chronology. The British officer types he scrutinizes are creatures of their age, Boris conservative and authoritarian.

38
00:08:20.78 --> 00:08:33.78
And this authoritarian piece that he's talking about. This may be the underlying theme of the book, this authoritarian attitude and personality type.

39
00:08:33.78 --> 00:08:38.78
And what it means and what it does to you and what it does to your people.

40
00:08:38.78 --> 00:08:47.78
Continuing on, they went to stuffy boarding schools and endured tyrannical parents and school teachers. They enlisted in a class system that expected snobbish conformity.

41
00:08:47.78 --> 00:09:02.78
And yet the deeper you read into the book, the more you realize that the specific circumstances of a raglan, haig, Montgomery are less important than their lifelong enlistment in the military hierarchy that constrains an often warps behavior.

42
00:09:02.78 --> 00:09:16.78
And you can see he's starting to throw out names, raglan, haig, Montgomery. So that's what this book is. He refers to individuals and shows what they did well, what they did bad and he does cover good leaders as well.

43
00:09:16.78 --> 00:09:20.78
At the heart of this book is a thesis that all can accept.

44
00:09:20.78 --> 00:09:31.78
All human decision makers are victims of a chronic hazard that emotion and motivation unconsciously distort and bias all fought and perception.

45
00:09:31.78 --> 00:09:38.78
Right? It's like crazy. This is what we talk about all the time.

46
00:09:38.78 --> 00:09:47.78
Detach from your emotions. You get distorted what he's writing in E.E.E. Go clouds all decisions.

47
00:09:47.78 --> 00:09:49.78
Right? That's what he's talking about.

48
00:09:49.78 --> 00:10:02.78
Man's needs biological, social or neurotic act on his perception of the world around him and the decisions he makes. No one in other words operates cleanly.

49
00:10:02.78 --> 00:10:09.78
What a good thing to remember. No one operates cleanly. You all have it going on.

50
00:10:09.78 --> 00:10:16.78
I did a underground podcast a while back and I talked about the fact that we're all insane.

51
00:10:16.78 --> 00:10:24.78
And that is something the definition of insanity is that your world doesn't match reality.

52
00:10:24.78 --> 00:10:28.78
And the fact of the matter is my world doesn't match your reality, Dave.

53
00:10:28.78 --> 00:10:33.78
I know we're probably pretty freaking close because we work in the same job. We have a similar background.

54
00:10:33.78 --> 00:10:37.78
But there's no way that you see things exactly the way I see it.

55
00:10:37.78 --> 00:10:46.78
Kerry, you and I have a similar background. But there's no way that we match up our realities don't match.

56
00:10:46.78 --> 00:10:50.78
So that means we're all insane. It's just a matter of what degree.

57
00:10:50.78 --> 00:10:56.78
And that means everyone you interact with is kind of insane. That means their reality is different than yours.

58
00:10:56.78 --> 00:10:59.78
So when you're in a leadership position, you're dealing with other people.

59
00:10:59.78 --> 00:11:09.78
Their reality is different than yours. So when you're making a decision and they hear that decision, their reality is different than yours.

60
00:11:09.78 --> 00:11:14.78
No one in other words operates cleanly.

61
00:11:14.78 --> 00:11:22.78
Singleness of mind, a key ingredient of successful command is always under siege by doubt, worries and distractions.

62
00:11:22.78 --> 00:11:30.78
We all churn through a sludge of life experiences that have formed us and left us with key strengths and weaknesses.

63
00:11:30.78 --> 00:11:35.78
The challenge for military commanders is all the greater because the stakes of their decisions are so high

64
00:11:35.78 --> 00:11:41.78
and because they operate in stressful environments, a made hunger, fatigue, heater cold, sleep deprivation,

65
00:11:41.78 --> 00:11:45.78
and the relentless ticking of the clock.

66
00:11:45.78 --> 00:11:58.78
Not for nothing, didn't Napoleon call unforgiving time. The grand element in warfare, which is epic because lately I've been talking about the leadership loop.

67
00:11:58.78 --> 00:12:05.78
And the number one thing I said you have to consider the number one thing that's in the front of my mind all the time in any leadership situation is time.

68
00:12:05.78 --> 00:12:09.78
What does he call the grand element? Time is what you have to think about.

69
00:12:09.78 --> 00:12:12.78
And sometimes the thought is, oh, we got plenty of time, which is cool.

70
00:12:12.78 --> 00:12:24.78
But you got to think about that. People that don't keep time in front of mind, they're always behind. They're always behind.

71
00:12:24.78 --> 00:12:27.78
Bro, we're two paragraphs.

72
00:12:27.78 --> 00:12:29.78
And I'll just said something.

73
00:12:29.78 --> 00:12:31.78
Go ahead. Go ahead. What do you got?

74
00:12:31.78 --> 00:12:34.78
I just, I always like hearing how these people write.

75
00:12:34.78 --> 00:12:38.78
And the word, like, this is a good writer. This is a right swell.

76
00:12:38.78 --> 00:12:45.78
This is just the full world, bro. But the fact that he went through all those things he was talking about, he called and I don't remember all the words.

77
00:12:45.78 --> 00:12:51.78
And when he got to time, he added the additional component of ungrateful ending.

78
00:12:51.78 --> 00:12:59.78
Because the heat, we can, it can relent, or we've got maybe some technology that we're going to wear a coat or some cold weather.

79
00:12:59.78 --> 00:13:03.78
We can mitigate all these other things.

80
00:13:03.78 --> 00:13:10.78
But time is unrelenting. There is no mitigation. And that is, that will be forever forever.

81
00:13:10.78 --> 00:13:15.78
We're not going to technology our way out of the time issue. Like, oh, we'll just slow time down.

82
00:13:15.78 --> 00:13:20.78
Like, we can manage the heat and all those other elements. I just like the way they, he adds that piece to it.

83
00:13:20.78 --> 00:13:23.78
And what's already, they can just a good, the way he writes is awesome.

84
00:13:23.78 --> 00:13:27.78
That's why as a leader and as a person, it has to be the number one thing you think about.

85
00:13:27.78 --> 00:13:31.78
It's the only thing that will give you no slack whatsoever.

86
00:13:31.78 --> 00:13:38.78
No, zero. That's it. That clock is ticking.

87
00:13:38.78 --> 00:13:44.78
Dixon uses several cases studies to elucidate military incompetence. He begins with a crummy and war,

88
00:13:44.78 --> 00:13:49.78
which Britain undertook in an era of rapid industrialization, prosperity and commercial dominance.

89
00:13:49.78 --> 00:13:53.78
Wouldn't it, wouldn't you think if you've got rapid industrialization, prosperity and commercial dominance,

90
00:13:53.78 --> 00:13:57.78
you just go crush everyone on a battlefield, wouldn't you think that?

91
00:13:57.78 --> 00:14:04.78
Victorian Britain was the last word in efficiency? Yet its military stumbled from one blood

92
00:14:04.78 --> 00:14:09.78
disaster to the next piling up 21,000, mostly avoidable dead.

93
00:14:09.78 --> 00:14:13.78
How could this be in view of Britain's world leadership?

94
00:14:13.78 --> 00:14:20.78
Much of it, Dixon finds, had to do it the command performance of 66-year-old Lord Ragland,

95
00:14:20.78 --> 00:14:25.78
an extreme introvert who died of severe depression during the campaign,

96
00:14:25.78 --> 00:14:29.78
and drifted like a rudderless ship. The officers under him suffered a familiar dilemma.

97
00:14:29.78 --> 00:14:34.78
If they took matters into their own hands, they could be accused of in subordination.

98
00:14:34.78 --> 00:14:39.78
If they let the rudderless ship drift further, they could be accused of incompetence.

99
00:14:39.78 --> 00:14:42.78
That's a catch 22.

100
00:14:42.78 --> 00:14:46.78
Ultimately, nothing was done.

101
00:14:46.78 --> 00:14:53.78
And the British troops and taxpayers bore the brunt of their systemic and command incompetence

102
00:14:53.78 --> 00:14:58.78
of which the notorious charge of the light brigade was but the thin end of the wedge.

103
00:14:58.78 --> 00:15:03.78
Since a foretarian organization, again, you're going to hear this word.

104
00:15:03.78 --> 00:15:06.78
And it took me a while to pick up on it. Even though it's really obvious to me right now,

105
00:15:06.78 --> 00:15:12.78
this authoritarian attitude is like this underlying one of the underlying themes throughout this.

106
00:15:12.78 --> 00:15:17.78
Since authoritarian organizations like the military are masters at shifting blame,

107
00:15:17.78 --> 00:15:21.78
the time-honor tactic of the cornered child.

108
00:15:21.78 --> 00:15:27.78
The British army survived the fiasco of the Korean-Korean war unreformed.

109
00:15:27.78 --> 00:15:34.78
So they went through all that 21,000 dead who knows what the price tag was, no reforms.

110
00:15:34.78 --> 00:15:39.78
A major theme of this book is in the incuragibility of military organizations.

111
00:15:39.78 --> 00:15:43.78
They must be removed from their pedestals cracked open and filled with daylight,

112
00:15:43.78 --> 00:15:47.78
which is another way of saying subjected to rigorous scrutiny and review.

113
00:15:47.78 --> 00:15:50.78
Unfortunately, they rarely are.

114
00:15:50.78 --> 00:15:54.78
Raglan's folly, which made the Crimean War.

115
00:15:54.78 --> 00:16:01.78
In Dixon's judgment, the prototype for protracted military incompetence was followed by the Burur War.

116
00:16:01.78 --> 00:16:08.78
Somehow, despite the similarities of the two campaigns fought far away for imperial interests,

117
00:16:08.78 --> 00:16:13.78
Britain applied no lessons learned from the Crimean campaign.

118
00:16:13.78 --> 00:16:21.78
London's performance in 1899 was even worse than 1855. It's, quote, military incompetence,

119
00:16:21.78 --> 00:16:25.78
straining, credibly, to the breaking point.

120
00:16:25.78 --> 00:16:28.78
Indeed, the British officers took pride in their amateurness.

121
00:16:28.78 --> 00:16:35.78
Their clubbing, good fellowship and their conviction that any effort at self-improvement or bad form.

122
00:16:35.78 --> 00:16:37.78
I'm going to say that again.

123
00:16:37.78 --> 00:16:44.78
Imagine you're in a group of people where self-improvement is considered bad form.

124
00:16:44.78 --> 00:16:51.78
They clung to unhelpful routines like sand crabs clinging to seaweed in storm time.

125
00:16:51.78 --> 00:16:58.78
They battled guerrillas on the South African Velt with luxury and baggage, including pianos,

126
00:16:58.78 --> 00:17:06.78
gramophones, chests of drawers, polo mallets, and mobile kitchens and bathrooms.

127
00:17:06.78 --> 00:17:11.78
The fight begins with the Burur's savages.

128
00:17:11.78 --> 00:17:13.78
Just horrible.

129
00:17:13.78 --> 00:17:19.78
General Redverse Bullar commanded the expedition like Raglan.

130
00:17:19.78 --> 00:17:23.78
He was in over his head. He lacked command experience imagination and confidence.

131
00:17:23.78 --> 00:17:28.78
He was passive and defiedists. The booer swept over him like a turnt.

132
00:17:28.78 --> 00:17:35.78
He never stopped retreating and the press nicknamed him reverse bullar.

133
00:17:35.78 --> 00:17:44.78
Field Marshal Douglas Hague's commanded World War I is an obvious place to stop and relish the psychology of military incompetence.

134
00:17:44.78 --> 00:17:48.78
Since Dickson's book, there has been a vigorous debate about Hague, foreign against,

135
00:17:48.78 --> 00:17:58.78
but few would dispute that Hague's psychology had much to do with his mediocre to a bismal performance as British expeditionary force commander.

136
00:17:58.78 --> 00:18:03.78
He was an old cavalryman with an outmoded view of warfare.

137
00:18:03.78 --> 00:18:12.78
He'd been ruled as a boy by a stern religious mother. He was solitary, aloof, and inspired by an obsessive need for orger.

138
00:18:12.78 --> 00:18:16.78
And this is another one of those things. That's sort of the authoritarian mindset.

139
00:18:16.78 --> 00:18:19.78
Everything to be organized. You want everything to be in order.

140
00:18:19.78 --> 00:18:25.78
And I'll say, and I'm not a super psychological nerd or psychology nerd,

141
00:18:25.78 --> 00:18:30.78
but he definitely dips into the childhood stuff. Probably a little bit more than I would.

142
00:18:30.78 --> 00:18:38.78
And the reason I think I don't dip as much into the childhood stuff is I've known people that had authoritarian parents and didn't end up like this,

143
00:18:38.78 --> 00:18:48.78
right, had whatever hyper-religious, strict parents and ended up, you know, in every level, every type of different person.

144
00:18:48.78 --> 00:18:52.78
I've known people that had total hippies for parents and led the kids do whatever they want,

145
00:18:52.78 --> 00:18:56.78
and I've seen those kids end up in different places on the spectrum.

146
00:18:56.78 --> 00:19:07.78
So I don't know if I, I don't know if I correlate these things as much or put as much weight on the upbringing as Dickson does.

147
00:19:07.78 --> 00:19:15.78
But that's just me. It's interesting to know. Could be it's definitely a contributing factor depending on how your personality reacts to it.

148
00:19:15.78 --> 00:19:21.78
Because I mean, we, you and I have kids, Dave, the kids are different.

149
00:19:21.78 --> 00:19:28.78
Like the kids are different. You could put them in a controlled environment with the exact same situation.

150
00:19:28.78 --> 00:19:32.78
Because you know, oh, the ones in the middle child, the ones in the oldest. And so, oh, this so that means you treat them differently.

151
00:19:32.78 --> 00:19:41.78
Well, even if you put them in a controlled environment, they got personalities. And that personality is going to come out.

152
00:19:41.78 --> 00:19:54.78
So obsessive need for word. It took him too long to grasp just how radically technology like machine guns and heavy artillery had changed warfare and rendered most of what he'd learned at staff college in the 1890s obsolete.

153
00:19:54.78 --> 00:20:01.78
Incredibly, he consisted to the end of the war that the battles he was engaged in were not quote normal warfare,

154
00:20:01.78 --> 00:20:06.78
which is just a bizarre mindset. Like this is normal.

155
00:20:06.78 --> 00:20:10.78
We'll get back to normal. This is just happening right now. This is normal.

156
00:20:10.78 --> 00:20:17.78
That's again, that reality versus mindset or perception. Like this is reality. This is your normal.

157
00:20:17.78 --> 00:20:20.78
Yeah, yeah. Then he hasn't figured that out.

158
00:20:20.78 --> 00:20:22.78
Negative. He's insane.

159
00:20:22.78 --> 00:20:23.78
Insane.

160
00:20:23.78 --> 00:20:36.78
Worse, he gave his subordinates the singular gift of the authoritarian defined by Dixon as to a terrible crippling obedience.

161
00:20:36.78 --> 00:20:46.78
Officers had to implement Higgs vague instructions. He left much and down because he was so unsure of himself or be replaced and disgraced.

162
00:20:46.78 --> 00:20:48.78
Higgs influence was awful.

163
00:20:48.78 --> 00:20:56.78
Officers under him were expected to attack and show quote offensive spirit even against the most invincible defensive fire.

164
00:20:56.78 --> 00:21:02.78
This was to demonstrate quote pluck and quote dash and quote optimism.

165
00:21:02.78 --> 00:21:05.78
Can you even fathom that shit?

166
00:21:05.78 --> 00:21:18.76
You're in World War One and my address to you Dave is like, hey Dave, alright, listen mate, what I want you to do is just I want you to charge with all your heart and show that the show the enemy that you got some fucking

167
00:21:18.76 --> 00:21:20.76
dash.

168
00:21:20.76 --> 00:21:28.76
By the way, yesterday you watched your entire Bethalion get mode down or your friends Battalion get mode down.

169
00:21:28.76 --> 00:21:35.76
To shelter in the trenches was to exhibit the disqualifying sin of pessimism.

170
00:21:35.76 --> 00:21:39.76
Danny, what's wrong with me? What you doing down there in the trench?

171
00:21:39.76 --> 00:21:43.76
Won't you get up there? Go on. Go on, son.

172
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:56.76
It's that's the disqualifying. It isn't like hey, hey, let's let's pull Dave out of his funk here. He's like, oh, he's in capable of doing this because he's his behavior reveals that he's the pessimistic pessimistic about living.

173
00:21:56.76 --> 00:22:01.76
And this is a guy who you said I think the quote was took too long to recognize the impact of the machine gun.

174
00:22:01.76 --> 00:22:06.76
How many engagements with a machine gun do you need for ego? Oh, yeah things are different now.

175
00:22:06.76 --> 00:22:09.76
You don't even need one complete engagement by the way.

176
00:22:09.76 --> 00:22:17.76
You get you get one volley of fire. You go oh shit just changed to everybody get back in the briefing room.

177
00:22:17.76 --> 00:22:20.76
We need a new point.

178
00:22:20.76 --> 00:22:29.76
All armies began the great war like this, but only a hege kept it up until 1917 coldly firing officers who wouldn't follow his ghastly directives.

179
00:22:29.76 --> 00:22:42.76
And he's brutally dispatched from a shadow dozens of miles behind the lines. Dixon's brilliant description of the military authoritarian fits hay like a Savile Roe suit.

180
00:22:42.76 --> 00:22:51.76
Superfishal toughness and ordering orderlyness are quote a brittle crust of defense against feelings of weakness and inadequacy.

181
00:22:51.76 --> 00:22:54.76
The authoritarian keeps up his spirits by whistling in the dark.

182
00:22:54.76 --> 00:23:06.76
He's the frightened child who wears the armor of a giant. His mind is a door locked in bolted shut against that which he fears most himself.

183
00:23:06.76 --> 00:23:12.76
The imagery is outstanding here. This guy is yeah he's sitting on the.

184
00:23:12.76 --> 00:23:23.76
All readers will appreciate the drift of Dixon's book, which might be summarized in George Bernard Shaw's wartime clip that quote, the British soldier can stand up to anything except the British war office.

185
00:23:23.76 --> 00:23:36.76
Mike Roe managing and stifling of initiative are byproducts of the hierarchy of military system.

186
00:23:36.76 --> 00:23:46.76
A yearning for old certain teas like the horse and the battleship, even when tanks and aircraft carriers made them obsolete, is understandable only when psychology is deployed.

187
00:23:46.76 --> 00:23:57.76
Unquestionably in any military, in any epoch, a prevailing culture of obedience and group loyalty, a deliberate process of military socialization.

188
00:23:57.76 --> 00:24:08.76
As two esteem psychologists wrote in their 1989 work on the social psychology of authority, once the military culture of obedience is established by training and service, men are quote,

189
00:24:08.76 --> 00:24:20.76
governed not so much by motivational processes, what they want as by perceptual ones, what they see required of them.

190
00:24:20.76 --> 00:24:28.76
Dixon sees fear as the common denominator in the general psychology of military organizations.

191
00:24:28.76 --> 00:24:43.76
And this is interesting fear of the bad performance review. Not fear of getting shot, not fear of machine gun, but fear of a bad performance review, not surprising even fear of failure over shadows hope of success leading to complacency group thinking bad decisions.

192
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:50.76
So if I'm afraid of a bad performance review, I'm probably don't want to do anything.

193
00:24:50.76 --> 00:25:00.76
I'm proud my go to is like I'm just going to sit here and we're not going to do anything. Best I'm saying, well if that's a day is doing I guess we'll all get in trouble. Dave will get in trouble first, so I'll do what he's doing.

194
00:25:00.76 --> 00:25:04.76
Status quo. Yeah, status quo all day.

195
00:25:04.76 --> 00:25:13.76
Attacking the flaws in a military plan was as dangerous to an officer's career in 2003 as in 1901.

196
00:25:13.76 --> 00:25:26.76
Officers around Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and US Central Command sent com leader General Tommy Franks had to bite their tongues when even the most preposterous plans were floated.

197
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:42.76
The same went for officers in Vietnam, pushing for a low intensity counter insurgency war as opposed to a high tempo conventional one was not the way to get ahead in an army that had made firepower and mobility its mantra.

198
00:25:42.76 --> 00:25:51.76
Military organizations Dixon tells us can create incompetence, uniformity and a graying hierarchy.

199
00:25:51.76 --> 00:26:03.76
The system all too often creates mediocrity as bright officers adapt to the plan and institutional priorities which are frequently at odds with reality and best practices.

200
00:26:03.76 --> 00:26:13.76
A recent example of this would be the US Army's decision not to deploy large numbers of ground troops to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in 2001.

201
00:26:13.76 --> 00:26:17.76
He was trapped in eastern Afghanistan near the Kyber Pass.

202
00:26:17.76 --> 00:26:23.76
The army had only to cordanoff his cave complex and escape routes with troops.

203
00:26:23.76 --> 00:26:41.76
But so insistent was Secretary Rumsfeld on keeping this force small in order to demonstrate the stripped down power of the army and its expeditionary potential and to leave troops off ramped for an invasion of Iraq that sent com commander Tommy Franks didn't insist on reinforcements.

204
00:26:41.76 --> 00:26:53.76
Nor would he have anyway. Nor would he have anyway for Franks for Franks took pride in never contradicting the famously can tankerist Rumsfeld.

205
00:26:53.76 --> 00:27:03.76
In the clinch Franks lacked moral courage and common failing among ingratiating authoritarians.

206
00:27:03.76 --> 00:27:22.76
The law not escaped and would remain out large for ten more years. Cognitive dissidents is another danger of the military organization. Memoirs from sent com and Washington remind us that most clear thinking officers recognize the failures of Rumsfeld and Franks even in real time but felt compelled to keep silent.

207
00:27:22.76 --> 00:27:41.76
But one who didn't army chief of staff General Eric Shinseki who insisted that massive numbers of US troops would be needed to stabilize it defeated Iraq was ridiculed and driven into retirement for the crime of speaking truth to power.

208
00:27:41.76 --> 00:27:52.76
This reinforces Dickson's point that it is not stupidity that leads to incompetence but rather the dead hand of the authoritarian personality.

209
00:27:52.76 --> 00:28:00.76
Which is an interesting take so he has to say that throughout the book because it's really easy to say these guys were stupid but they're not stupid.

210
00:28:00.76 --> 00:28:09.76
In many cases they're really freaking smart military organizations all too often force their members to act in competently.

211
00:28:09.76 --> 00:28:32.76
When asked by president George W. Bush to distinguish his views on the 911 wars from Rumsfeld's general Tommy Franks weirdly replied, Sir, I think exactly what my secretary thinks what he's ever thought what he will think or whatever he thought he might think.

212
00:28:32.76 --> 00:28:49.76
Given the dreadful stakes in the wars this was incompetence on stills Franks like General William Westmoreland is a fine example of the Peter principle also referenced by Dixon by which leaders are promoted beyond their capabilities to an unimagined level of incompetence and efficiency.

213
00:28:49.76 --> 00:29:07.76
So the Peter principle says that oh Dave did a good job as a squad leader let's make him a platoon leader okay did a good job as a platoon leader let's make him a company commander oh he did a good job as a company commander let's make him a battalion commander but he's not capable so he's not capable of that's his position.

214
00:29:07.76 --> 00:29:17.76
He's not competent in that position but that's his position and what you end up with is everybody promotes to now you don't get promoted to brigade commander but it doesn't matter you're a battalion commander.

215
00:29:17.76 --> 00:29:24.76
So now we have a bunch guess what all the other battalion commanders are most of them all the same thing that I'll promote it to the level of incompetence.

216
00:29:24.76 --> 00:29:35.76
Right of course General Franks thought that he was being submissive and funny he was speaking what Dixon calls throughout the book bullshit.

217
00:29:35.76 --> 00:29:45.76
Keeping up appearances in this way is the essence of authoritarian structures proving ones reliability even a bad even in a bad cause the internal politics of bullshit in war or peace.

218
00:29:45.76 --> 00:29:52.76
And actually become a substitute for incisive thinking this decreases initiative and increases dependency.

219
00:29:52.76 --> 00:30:08.76
There is a huge irony for the pattern of modern warfare from Dixon's period to our own has been to require more and more independence and initiative as information and intelligence pass more quickly and in greater volume down the chain of command.

220
00:30:08.76 --> 00:30:18.76
So even though we've gotten worse and we become more authoritarian the flow of information and the ability to maneuver and think for yourself has increased.

221
00:30:18.76 --> 00:30:30.76
So we're going in the wrong direction. Dixon forces us to reconsider the assumption that military organizations operate as effective teams.

222
00:30:30.76 --> 00:30:34.76
In fact they are often anything but effective.

223
00:30:34.76 --> 00:30:47.76
The difficulties Britain's interwar reformers JFC follower and Basil Ladelle Hart had in introducing the British army establishment to quote.

224
00:30:47.76 --> 00:31:06.76
Thresh the grist from the trough chaff in conventional theories of war as fuller ported our legendary. Fuller in the 1920 saw new technologies like the tank and the airplane as able to leap from the muscular warfare of the Great War to a faster quicker deadlier less destructive.

225
00:31:06.76 --> 00:31:18.76
The United Warfare that would administer quick relative bloodless shot through the brain not the intermanable pounding with flesh and guns that characterize world war one.

226
00:31:18.76 --> 00:31:23.76
So you had people after World War One that and we've covered in great detail.

227
00:31:23.76 --> 00:31:38.76
We've covered in hard in this podcast. We don't need to do it that way that way didn't make much sense. Ladelle Hart in 1926 considered the British army's problems of institutional rigidity and stuffiness. So great that he equated it with illness.

228
00:31:38.76 --> 00:31:52.76
For the army's quote, a noculation with the serum of mobility. The army was unmoved forcing god flies like Ladelle Hart into early retirement.

229
00:31:52.76 --> 00:31:56.76
You know what? We don't really like what you're saying. Why don't you retire?

230
00:31:56.76 --> 00:32:09.76
Gickson's account of Ladelle Hart lacks the more recent scholarship on the rather slippery British theorist. But he rightly sites that the captain has just a sort of man a military organization finds intolerable.

231
00:32:09.76 --> 00:32:26.76
Brash bright insightful eloquent and opinionated. That's who we don't like. That's who we don't want. We don't want someone that's bright. That's brash. That's insightful. That's eloquent and opinionated. We don't want that person.

232
00:32:26.76 --> 00:32:32.76
It's a potent human being. It's a potent human being. It's got to watch out for it.

233
00:32:32.76 --> 00:32:44.76
And it's interesting because you know, maybe if Ladelle Hart had read his own book and maybe taken a little bit more of an indirect approach on some of these things. He might have done a little bit better convincing the chain and command.

234
00:32:44.76 --> 00:32:49.76
Right? 100%. He didn't get to read his own book. He never loves you. Unfortunately for him.

235
00:32:49.76 --> 00:33:01.76
Because he went hard and told them they needed to be anoculated with the serum of mobility. That's a rough thing to say up the chain and command. You're telling your leadership. They need to get a noculate.

236
00:33:01.76 --> 00:33:08.76
You need to completely change what you're doing. You need anoculation. That's a that's a bold attack. That's a frontal attack. That's a directed attack.

237
00:33:08.76 --> 00:33:19.76
And I've been in direct about that. He became what? He became a prophet. He was a prophet and what happens to prophet? He told us what happens to prophet. They get fired.

238
00:33:19.76 --> 00:33:28.76
They get stoned. They get stoned. They get crucified. That's what happens to prophets. And he was a prophet. And what happened to him? Got drummed out of the army.

239
00:33:28.76 --> 00:33:42.76
There seems to be a place where there's a transformation that happens where these, I don't want to call him students, but these kind of rebels become the prophet though.

240
00:33:42.76 --> 00:33:54.76
Like where there it goes from a kind of a detached perspective to a, no, this is what needs to happen. Why won't you listen, you know, putting that kind of thought forward.

241
00:33:54.76 --> 00:34:06.76
I feel like they become, you know, if you start to get emotional, which which can happen, especially when you've got wives at stake or you're, you know, you just pointed to hack where it's book.

242
00:34:06.76 --> 00:34:14.76
Hackwork reached a point where he was trying to persuade people and talking about how we should do it and did it with his own battalion and showed it with the results were.

243
00:34:14.76 --> 00:34:25.76
When you do account and urgency, we need to be not going head to head. We need to act like gorillas, right. We need to fight like gorillas. He was doing that. He was showing the results.

244
00:34:25.76 --> 00:34:36.76
But at a certain point like you just said, you are correct, certain point. They say, you know what? We got to stop doing this and they become a prophet. And they become martyr.

245
00:34:36.76 --> 00:34:50.76
And Ladell Hart became a martyr and got drummed out of the army. David Hackworth became a martyr, got drummed out of the army. Whether that helped or not, didn't help immediately.

246
00:34:50.76 --> 00:35:06.76
Ladell Hart's last act in uniform was to submit an essay on the mechanization of the army for a military competition. Ladell Hart lost to an essay titled limitations of the tank.

247
00:35:06.76 --> 00:35:11.76
That's crazy, right? You can't make that up. You can't make that up.

248
00:35:11.76 --> 00:35:22.76
Little bit of iron either. And they about to get blitz cragged like you read about. You know what I'm saying? They got blitz cragged straight up. That's what went down.

249
00:35:22.76 --> 00:35:25.76
Yeah.

250
00:35:25.76 --> 00:35:47.76
On Britain's failure to embrace armored warfare in time to affect the fighting of 1940, Ladell Hart recalled, if a soldier advocates any new idea of real importance, he builds up such a wall of obstruction compounded of resentment, suspicion and inertia that the idea only succeeds at the sacrifice of himself.

251
00:35:47.76 --> 00:35:56.76
As the wall finally yields to the pressure of the new idea it falls and crushes him. So that's him saying he did become the marker, right?

252
00:35:56.76 --> 00:36:11.76
This is the process of military incompetence vested interests bureaucratic turf's defensive services and uncertain leaders all contribute to a stifling of innovation and all too often escape,

253
00:36:11.76 --> 00:36:18.46
unless of certain they're actually worthy of innovators' inevitably-dixon sights of great French statement forge clean Zoom

254
00:36:18.46 --> 00:36:21.94
in this context quote,

255
00:36:21.94 --> 00:36:28.76
woah is too serious a business to be left to the generals?

256
00:36:28.76 --> 00:36:32.42
That's no joke.

257
00:36:32.42 --> 00:36:39.14
Who had commanded Britain's tank corps in World War I, later said, fighting the Germans as a joke compared

258
00:36:39.14 --> 00:36:41.86
with fighting the British.

259
00:36:41.86 --> 00:36:48.14
The Blumpish Generals, conservatives of a dead military epoch, simply would not be budged.

260
00:36:48.14 --> 00:36:50.02
To be fair, there was no easy solution.

261
00:36:50.02 --> 00:36:53.62
Britain had to prepare for war simultaneously and Europe against the Germans, and all

262
00:36:53.62 --> 00:36:58.54
across its empire against a range of potential enemies, like Italy, Japan, and Indian

263
00:36:58.54 --> 00:37:03.26
or Palestinian nationalists, tank smite work against the Germans, but they'd be acquired

264
00:37:03.26 --> 00:37:08.54
at the expense of the tools needed to fight the small wars around the fringes of the empire.

265
00:37:08.54 --> 00:37:12.14
That was no excuse for lethargy.

266
00:37:12.14 --> 00:37:17.78
Yet lethargy is precisely what flourishes in the world of the authoritarian, where vigorous

267
00:37:17.78 --> 00:37:22.06
debate and reform are interpreted as a frontry.

268
00:37:22.06 --> 00:37:24.10
Can't even debate.

269
00:37:24.10 --> 00:37:25.10
Can't even debate.

270
00:37:25.10 --> 00:37:27.46
Why not even having debates around here?

271
00:37:27.46 --> 00:37:32.02
And you can picture that authoritarian, platoon commander.

272
00:37:32.02 --> 00:37:35.42
He doesn't want to hear debate about the way we should do this mission.

273
00:37:35.42 --> 00:37:36.70
Doesn't want to debate about that.

274
00:37:36.70 --> 00:37:40.54
The authoritarian CEO of the company does want to debate about how we're going to move

275
00:37:40.54 --> 00:37:42.46
into this new market area.

276
00:37:42.46 --> 00:37:48.46
He wants people to shut up and do what I told you to do.

277
00:37:48.46 --> 00:37:52.66
In France, Charles De Gaulle battled the same sort of establishment.

278
00:37:52.66 --> 00:37:56.18
He wanted a small professional army, highly mobile and leverage with air power.

279
00:37:56.18 --> 00:38:02.78
His ideas broke against the power of the old sweats, like General's Maurice Gainland

280
00:38:02.78 --> 00:38:09.10
and Philippe Petain, who looked back serenely on the victory of 1918 and saw the future

281
00:38:09.10 --> 00:38:12.34
as just an elaboration of that, not something new.

282
00:38:12.34 --> 00:38:18.66
Tank's patane characters, the police noted, are the Sancho Ponsis to weighted down to

283
00:38:18.66 --> 00:38:19.66
fight.

284
00:38:19.66 --> 00:38:28.38
This is a character in Don Kiodi, like a comic relief, but that guy that can't really fight.

285
00:38:28.38 --> 00:38:33.62
That criticism from recalled Don Kiodi himself, who told Sancho one fine day, too much sanity

286
00:38:33.62 --> 00:38:42.54
may be madness and madness to see life as it is and not as it should be.

287
00:38:42.54 --> 00:38:46.66
And of course, there was no more twisted authoritarian than Joseph Stalin, who literally

288
00:38:46.66 --> 00:38:51.90
destroyed the reforms of Marshall, Mcleo, Turkachewski.

289
00:38:51.90 --> 00:38:56.46
Turkachewski's deep battle idea might have made the red army as formidable as the

290
00:38:56.46 --> 00:38:59.10
Germans in time for World War II.

291
00:38:59.10 --> 00:39:04.66
It called for, quote, linked and simultaneous destructive operations and, quote, mechanized

292
00:39:04.66 --> 00:39:09.94
operational warfare carried on the backs of tanks.

293
00:39:09.94 --> 00:39:14.42
Stalin killed Turkachewski and all of his accolades in the purge of 1937.

294
00:39:14.42 --> 00:39:17.86
It's got some good ideas, whatever.

295
00:39:17.86 --> 00:39:21.46
The general had studied the Germans to closely he appeared threatening and suspicious

296
00:39:21.46 --> 00:39:27.02
to Stalin precisely because of his restless mind and broad professional circle, the two

297
00:39:27.02 --> 00:39:32.46
things that should have made him a fine model off, sir, not a criminal.

298
00:39:32.46 --> 00:39:37.70
The army that survived the purges was a scarcely improved version of the clumsy peasant

299
00:39:37.70 --> 00:39:39.98
force in World War I.

300
00:39:39.98 --> 00:39:45.90
They were performed about as well and it's early campaigns.

301
00:39:45.90 --> 00:39:49.94
Imagine your France and you get done with World War I and you're like, what do we need

302
00:39:49.94 --> 00:39:51.26
to change?

303
00:39:51.26 --> 00:39:54.30
We won.

304
00:39:54.30 --> 00:39:57.58
And you know, the Germans were like, we lost, what can we change?

305
00:39:57.58 --> 00:40:01.86
Maybe if they were to one, they wouldn't have changed what they did.

306
00:40:01.86 --> 00:40:07.34
Want to come up with the bullets Craig.

307
00:40:07.34 --> 00:40:14.62
We can have which for the victors of World War I, the victory proved intellectually crippling.

308
00:40:14.62 --> 00:40:19.66
Old weapons, mean old tactics and whereas the Germans were plucked clean of weapons in

309
00:40:19.66 --> 00:40:24.30
1919 and forced to begin a new with tanks and aircraft, the victorious allies clung to

310
00:40:24.30 --> 00:40:29.54
what it worked, infantry artillery and field fortifications which reached their aptitude

311
00:40:29.54 --> 00:40:36.30
with the magnoline, all of this reinforced military tendency to do nothing.

312
00:40:36.30 --> 00:40:44.34
Nothing was safer in the crabbed minds of these men than the risk of failed ventures.

313
00:40:44.34 --> 00:40:48.82
To Dixon's mind is the military of Theratarians lack of emotional maturity that makes

314
00:40:48.82 --> 00:40:55.70
him or her so dangerous to the organization even once he deliberately with other authoritarians,

315
00:40:55.70 --> 00:41:02.74
passive dependent insecure they are in Dixon's word frightened children in the army in the

316
00:41:02.74 --> 00:41:04.86
armor of men.

317
00:41:04.86 --> 00:41:10.74
The worst mischief happens when they are promoted to supreme command not because they overreach,

318
00:41:10.74 --> 00:41:15.22
but because they have risen to that rank by obeying orders.

319
00:41:15.22 --> 00:41:20.30
Suddenly with no one above them, they become unmord which is a scary thing, right?

320
00:41:20.30 --> 00:41:22.54
Who gets promoted?

321
00:41:22.54 --> 00:41:25.46
I'm promoting the person that obeyed me.

322
00:41:25.46 --> 00:41:28.90
If I'm in a foreritarian who's getting promoted?

323
00:41:28.90 --> 00:41:30.54
That's the way I should have framed that question.

324
00:41:30.54 --> 00:41:32.22
I'm promoting the person that obeyed me.

325
00:41:32.22 --> 00:41:35.62
I'm definitely not promoting Dave Burke that asked me a bunch of questions every time I

326
00:41:35.62 --> 00:41:36.78
put out some word.

327
00:41:36.78 --> 00:41:43.26
I'm definitely not promoting Carrie who's got some common at the end of my briefing.

328
00:41:43.26 --> 00:41:44.62
That seems a little bit undermining.

329
00:41:44.62 --> 00:41:45.62
You're not getting promoted.

330
00:41:45.62 --> 00:41:46.62
Neither you.

331
00:41:46.62 --> 00:41:47.62
I got a yes man over here.

332
00:41:47.62 --> 00:41:50.94
Get promoted.

333
00:41:50.94 --> 00:42:00.22
They compensate for this weightlessness with procrastination, with more bullshit or busy work.

334
00:42:00.22 --> 00:42:04.22
They retreat into familiar routines and habits in battle.

335
00:42:04.22 --> 00:42:08.58
They might waste their men or suffer a paralyzing compassion for them.

336
00:42:08.58 --> 00:42:13.18
I don't know.

337
00:42:13.18 --> 00:42:19.26
In the Navy, well maybe I'm getting this from Hollywood.

338
00:42:19.26 --> 00:42:20.90
I don't know.

339
00:42:20.90 --> 00:42:22.98
No, I think it's from the Navy.

340
00:42:22.98 --> 00:42:29.02
We call polishing your boots, chicken, chicken shit stuff.

341
00:42:29.02 --> 00:42:31.42
Do you guess have anything like that in the Marine Corps?

342
00:42:31.42 --> 00:42:32.94
Definitely have that term.

343
00:42:32.94 --> 00:42:39.58
Would you apply the term chicken shit to polishing boots, to pressing your uniform, to

344
00:42:39.58 --> 00:42:45.66
startching your eight-sided cover, doing things that you know mean nothing.

345
00:42:45.66 --> 00:42:48.18
Chicken shit, Marine Corps, Carrie, confirmed?

346
00:42:48.18 --> 00:42:50.18
So, this confirmed?

347
00:42:50.18 --> 00:42:51.18
Negative.

348
00:42:51.18 --> 00:42:54.58
We didn't use chicken shit and your duration.

349
00:42:54.58 --> 00:42:55.58
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:42:55.58 --> 00:42:56.58
New Corps.

351
00:42:56.58 --> 00:42:57.58
Yeah.

352
00:42:57.58 --> 00:42:58.58
You guys call that chicken poo.

353
00:42:58.58 --> 00:42:59.58
You keep it.

354
00:42:59.58 --> 00:43:04.02
I'm not going to show you.

355
00:43:04.02 --> 00:43:05.26
But that's a real thing.

356
00:43:05.26 --> 00:43:10.22
So, what's interesting is he goes into this and says, you know, if I don't know what to

357
00:43:10.22 --> 00:43:13.26
do with Dave, I'm not sure what the guess what I do.

358
00:43:13.26 --> 00:43:15.94
You knew polish your boots.

359
00:43:15.94 --> 00:43:17.42
That's the distinction.

360
00:43:17.42 --> 00:43:20.70
Because as I'm saying, I'm like, hey, the message isn't like, you don't need to shine

361
00:43:20.70 --> 00:43:23.02
your boots or have a good looking uniform.

362
00:43:23.02 --> 00:43:24.42
Because that stuff doesn't matter.

363
00:43:24.42 --> 00:43:28.94
But that stuff matters in a different, much like when we hear what hackers rules

364
00:43:28.94 --> 00:43:30.74
were, hey, here's what we're going to do.

365
00:43:30.74 --> 00:43:35.38
Here's the reason why those things are important as opposed to if I got to do all

366
00:43:35.38 --> 00:43:39.54
out of punishment and I got to make you do stuff with your time that it's a complete

367
00:43:39.54 --> 00:43:40.54
and total waste of time.

368
00:43:40.54 --> 00:43:43.90
That's what the term, my recollection of maybe a generational thing is like, what

369
00:43:43.90 --> 00:43:46.06
are we doing we're sitting around?

370
00:43:46.06 --> 00:43:50.78
We're going to, what would we do the strip of the floor?

371
00:43:50.78 --> 00:43:52.74
Yeah, that's what we're going to strip of the floor is going to.

372
00:43:52.74 --> 00:43:53.74
Why?

373
00:43:53.74 --> 00:43:54.74
So I was in Listeria.

374
00:43:54.74 --> 00:43:55.74
There you go.

375
00:43:55.74 --> 00:43:56.74
Yeah.

376
00:43:56.74 --> 00:43:57.74
So that's the distinction.

377
00:43:57.74 --> 00:44:00.18
Yeah, that's the distinction right there.

378
00:44:00.18 --> 00:44:02.18
And there's a meme out there now.

379
00:44:02.18 --> 00:44:03.18
And this is famous picture.

380
00:44:03.18 --> 00:44:09.66
It's a picture of a marine with like a squeegee, like squeaging the predict in a rainstorm.

381
00:44:09.66 --> 00:44:10.66
Yeah.

382
00:44:10.66 --> 00:44:11.66
We got it.

383
00:44:11.66 --> 00:44:12.66
Just get it.

384
00:44:12.66 --> 00:44:15.58
We did have a green weeny was the go-to.

385
00:44:15.58 --> 00:44:16.98
You're getting the green weeny there.

386
00:44:16.98 --> 00:44:18.98
Was the floor we called that.

387
00:44:18.98 --> 00:44:19.98
Right.

388
00:44:19.98 --> 00:44:20.98
So I mean.

389
00:44:20.98 --> 00:44:21.98
Yeah.

390
00:44:21.98 --> 00:44:27.50
Another thing he was talking about kind of the hallmarker, though, I don't know, fricking

391
00:44:27.50 --> 00:44:35.18
sentiment in this authoritarian regime, he said, lethurgy in parallelization.

392
00:44:35.18 --> 00:44:41.38
And there's this type of language that that kind of punishment, dulling out, does to

393
00:44:41.38 --> 00:44:46.30
troops that it's just this, I don't even care.

394
00:44:46.30 --> 00:44:48.86
Like I just don't, I don't care.

395
00:44:48.86 --> 00:44:53.82
You know, and that's kind of that chicken shit or green weeny vibe that you get when

396
00:44:53.82 --> 00:44:59.90
that's the kind of, kind of, leadership.

397
00:44:59.90 --> 00:45:01.74
History is littered with such examples.

398
00:45:01.74 --> 00:45:06.74
General George McLean was paralyzed by his vast responsibilities as Lincoln, Lincoln's

399
00:45:06.74 --> 00:45:14.90
General and Chief, General Ludwig Benedict had excellent chance to destroy the Prussian Army

400
00:45:14.90 --> 00:45:18.82
in 1866, but he didn't dare.

401
00:45:18.82 --> 00:45:26.02
General, General, Bazane stood with a concentrated French army between widely separated German

402
00:45:26.02 --> 00:45:31.34
armies in 1870, but failed to strike in any direction, effectively permitting the Prussian

403
00:45:31.34 --> 00:45:36.74
to unite the armies and win the Franco-Prussian War.

404
00:45:36.74 --> 00:45:43.74
One historian accurately described Hague's command in World War I as a, quote, floating

405
00:45:43.74 --> 00:45:45.46
helpless whale.

406
00:45:45.46 --> 00:45:50.54
So slow was Hague's, slow, slow was Hague to issue detailed direct instructions to his

407
00:45:50.54 --> 00:45:54.74
subordinate commanders and solve the problem of the German defensive fire.

408
00:45:54.74 --> 00:46:01.38
Officers with General Maurice Gamelin, who commanded the French army in May 1940, when German

409
00:46:01.38 --> 00:46:08.50
Panzers knifeed across the Muse described Gamelin as, quote, stricken by a dull and pervasive

410
00:46:08.50 --> 00:46:11.50
fear and quote.

411
00:46:11.50 --> 00:46:16.42
Instead of leading a counter attack against the Nazi invaders, the French General sat

412
00:46:16.42 --> 00:46:23.02
passively in army headquarters at Vincent's, a colleague there described him, thus, quote,

413
00:46:23.02 --> 00:46:26.30
he was like a submarine without a periscope and quote.

414
00:46:26.30 --> 00:46:34.06
US General John Lucas landed on undefended beaches at Anzio 1944, yet fearfully dug in instead

415
00:46:34.06 --> 00:46:39.34
of thrusting to Rome, giving the faraway Germans time to react and circle him and lengthen

416
00:46:39.34 --> 00:46:41.30
the war.

417
00:46:41.30 --> 00:46:47.78
That fear of making a call.

418
00:46:47.78 --> 00:46:51.34
That's everyone of those examples is just I'm afraid to make a call.

419
00:46:51.34 --> 00:46:57.34
The best generals, Dixon concludes, have been the Mavericks, leaders like Erwin Rommel,

420
00:46:57.34 --> 00:47:02.14
Horace Yonelsson and Napoleon Bonaparte, men who had the intelligence confidence to resist

421
00:47:02.14 --> 00:47:06.22
and roll back the negative psychology of the military organization.

422
00:47:06.22 --> 00:47:10.06
Unfortunately, the average general is not this sort of man.

423
00:47:10.06 --> 00:47:15.62
These are notes that military leaders are often chosen for their affability or appearance,

424
00:47:15.62 --> 00:47:21.82
like general bull are big bone, square jawed or general, neolrichia tobrook, a great

425
00:47:21.82 --> 00:47:24.22
era of decisiveness.

426
00:47:24.22 --> 00:47:31.22
But the bluff appearance too often masks doubt and pessimism as T.E. Lawrence would say in

427
00:47:31.22 --> 00:47:35.38
the same context too much body and too little head.

428
00:47:35.38 --> 00:47:41.18
You know what's interesting about this is I was talking to somebody at an event I was just

429
00:47:41.18 --> 00:47:43.18
at.

430
00:47:43.18 --> 00:47:47.74
And there's a certain military, like a military bearing, right?

431
00:47:47.74 --> 00:47:49.70
We use that term military bearing.

432
00:47:49.70 --> 00:47:54.86
People can utilize military bearing and you see leaders do this in the military all the

433
00:47:54.86 --> 00:47:55.86
time.

434
00:47:55.86 --> 00:48:00.70
They utilize military bearing as a, it's like a defensive mechanism.

435
00:48:00.70 --> 00:48:03.90
You know, you talk like this, you put the word out.

436
00:48:03.90 --> 00:48:05.70
You fur your brow a little bit.

437
00:48:05.70 --> 00:48:08.74
And you say, no, this is what we need to get done right now.

438
00:48:08.74 --> 00:48:10.30
And they get good at it.

439
00:48:10.30 --> 00:48:16.26
They become brow beaters, but they're so good at it that people are like, oh, I mean, okay.

440
00:48:16.26 --> 00:48:21.26
I mean, that's, they kind of back off and becomes a technique.

441
00:48:21.26 --> 00:48:25.82
So it's beyond just the way that they look, but they start to learn how to act.

442
00:48:25.82 --> 00:48:30.90
That's going to just kind of allow them to sort of get away with either not doing something

443
00:48:30.90 --> 00:48:32.38
or doing something that doesn't make sense.

444
00:48:32.38 --> 00:48:37.98
These kind of, you know, drop their voice a little bit and sort of, you know, stand up

445
00:48:37.98 --> 00:48:39.86
straight, get that posture going.

446
00:48:39.86 --> 00:48:42.74
That looks someone in the eyes and say, you need to stand down.

447
00:48:42.74 --> 00:48:47.30
So Dave Burke, as he says, Hey, boss, I'm wondering if we should worry about that.

448
00:48:47.30 --> 00:48:48.30
Hi, Greg.

449
00:48:48.30 --> 00:48:51.18
Hey, Burke, you need to worry about what you need to worry about.

450
00:48:51.18 --> 00:48:57.62
And people get good enough at that little act that Burke submits, right?

451
00:48:57.62 --> 00:49:01.86
Because you're asking it on this question, but you're not quite, it's an earnest question.

452
00:49:01.86 --> 00:49:04.38
You're not even, you're, you're asking a real question.

453
00:49:04.38 --> 00:49:07.86
And I come at you with the, Hey, Burke, you didn't don't need to worry about that.

454
00:49:07.86 --> 00:49:10.02
You used to say, New Lane, I got discovered.

455
00:49:10.02 --> 00:49:13.66
And your response is like, Oh, okay, you know, drop, drop, drop.

456
00:49:13.66 --> 00:49:15.02
That plus seniority.

457
00:49:15.02 --> 00:49:19.14
Oh, yeah, plus a little bit of the rank or whatever on the collar there.

458
00:49:19.14 --> 00:49:22.38
I mean, that's, that'll shut down all kinds of pushback.

459
00:49:22.38 --> 00:49:24.38
Shut down all kinds of pushback.

460
00:49:24.38 --> 00:49:26.86
Is that how you operated Dave?

461
00:49:26.86 --> 00:49:31.54
Do you see that?

462
00:49:31.54 --> 00:49:33.34
I call that brow meeting.

463
00:49:33.34 --> 00:49:34.62
You guys haven't heard that term before.

464
00:49:34.62 --> 00:49:35.14
brow meeting?

465
00:49:35.14 --> 00:49:35.98
Yeah, I call that brow meeting.

466
00:49:35.98 --> 00:49:39.58
There's plenty of leaders that, that's their leadership style.

467
00:49:39.58 --> 00:49:41.22
That they, you know, they could write a book.

468
00:49:41.22 --> 00:49:44.42
If they were to try and write leadership strategy and tactics, it would just be called

469
00:49:44.42 --> 00:49:45.86
like leadership through brow meeting.

470
00:49:45.86 --> 00:49:49.18
And they could go through, listen, when someone starts asking questions, first of all, you

471
00:49:49.18 --> 00:49:51.02
know, elevate your voice a little bit.

472
00:49:51.02 --> 00:49:52.46
You know, elevate your voice just a little bit.

473
00:49:52.46 --> 00:49:57.30
So they know, you need to throw your brow, which I'm a pro at, right?

474
00:49:57.30 --> 00:49:59.30
I got a, I got his born with a fur brow.

475
00:49:59.30 --> 00:50:04.46
You could throw your brow, elevate, you know, get your posture a little bit more rigid.

476
00:50:04.46 --> 00:50:09.90
So they can see that you're not backing down, raise your voice and speak in very direct tones.

477
00:50:09.90 --> 00:50:14.74
Burke, look, you need to worry about your part of the mission.

478
00:50:14.74 --> 00:50:18.58
And that, like you said, that's shut stuff down.

479
00:50:18.58 --> 00:50:20.06
That's the frequency right there.

480
00:50:20.06 --> 00:50:21.06
That's right in there.

481
00:50:21.06 --> 00:50:22.42
Right in there.

482
00:50:22.42 --> 00:50:25.02
Right in there.

483
00:50:25.02 --> 00:50:26.02
Right in there.

484
00:50:26.02 --> 00:50:30.06
It's interesting.

485
00:50:30.06 --> 00:50:31.06
Just PID.

486
00:50:31.06 --> 00:50:33.06
I just PID to think, right?

487
00:50:33.06 --> 00:50:38.98
I've been seeing that quite a bit lately, too.

488
00:50:38.98 --> 00:50:45.38
Without a sharpened adaptable mind, the incompetent general succumbs to cognitive

489
00:50:45.38 --> 00:50:50.66
dissidents rejecting or ignoring unpalpable news or intelligence.

490
00:50:50.66 --> 00:50:55.98
General Arthur Perseval at Singapore was this type simply refusing to credit that

491
00:50:55.98 --> 00:51:00.46
the Japanese attack is fortified island base.

492
00:51:00.46 --> 00:51:03.90
We ran through that on this podcast that guys get reports.

493
00:51:03.90 --> 00:51:07.02
Hey, the Japanese are literally surrounding us.

494
00:51:07.02 --> 00:51:09.78
He's like, yeah, they're not going to attack.

495
00:51:09.78 --> 00:51:14.46
To explain the average general, Dixon has to resort to ego psychology.

496
00:51:14.46 --> 00:51:20.30
The average general, like so many average men and women, is trapped in the neurotic paradox.

497
00:51:20.30 --> 00:51:22.22
And here's the neurotic paradox.

498
00:51:22.22 --> 00:51:29.14
The need to be loved leads to twin quests for admiration on the one hand and power and

499
00:51:29.14 --> 00:51:30.14
fame on the other.

500
00:51:30.14 --> 00:51:32.18
So you want to be liked, but you want to be powerful.

501
00:51:32.18 --> 00:51:34.06
And you got this thing going on all the time.

502
00:51:34.06 --> 00:51:36.54
Naturally, the two quests collide violently.

503
00:51:36.54 --> 00:51:40.02
More power means that more people dislike or envy you.

504
00:51:40.02 --> 00:51:45.42
The great leaders rise above the paradox by performing confidently and taking praise, promotion

505
00:51:45.42 --> 00:51:49.22
and criticism in mature, measured, stride.

506
00:51:49.22 --> 00:51:54.94
Like kiplings, ideal man, they quote meat with triumph and disaster and treat those two

507
00:51:54.94 --> 00:51:59.14
imposteres just the same.

508
00:51:59.14 --> 00:52:05.30
But most of Dixon subjects and the reason, look, Dixon concentrates on the bad.

509
00:52:05.30 --> 00:52:08.54
So that's when he says most of Dixon subs, he concentrates on the bad.

510
00:52:08.54 --> 00:52:10.22
He doesn't concentrate on the good leaders.

511
00:52:10.22 --> 00:52:12.90
Plenty books about good leaders out there.

512
00:52:12.90 --> 00:52:17.54
Most of Dixon subjects, like most of our own, are not great, but merely ordinary, weak and

513
00:52:17.54 --> 00:52:24.58
often petty, hence the need to understand and apply the psychological component of history.

514
00:52:24.58 --> 00:52:25.74
Dixon's book is in two parts.

515
00:52:25.74 --> 00:52:30.42
The first presents the case studies, the second, the psychological behaviors such as snobbery

516
00:52:30.42 --> 00:52:36.74
and anti-affemnacy, which contribute to institutional, langer.

517
00:52:36.74 --> 00:52:43.34
In every man and earthy, hungry, id battles with an intelligent, tactful ego overseen

518
00:52:43.34 --> 00:52:45.38
by a watchful super ego.

519
00:52:45.38 --> 00:52:46.54
This is good.

520
00:52:46.54 --> 00:52:53.70
And Dixon writes, is basically a battlefield, a dark cellar, in which a well-bred

521
00:52:53.70 --> 00:53:00.18
spinster lady and a sex-crazed monkey are forever engaged in mortal combat, the struggle

522
00:53:00.18 --> 00:53:04.42
being refereed by a rather nervous bank clerk.

523
00:53:04.42 --> 00:53:08.14
That's what's going on in your head.

524
00:53:08.14 --> 00:53:13.42
This is the fate of every human, excellence, mediocrity, or incompetence hinge on how smoothly

525
00:53:13.42 --> 00:53:18.66
the monkey, the spinster, and the bait clerk settled their differences.

526
00:53:18.66 --> 00:53:24.50
Reading about older wars, one might suppose that modern times deliver more modern officers,

527
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:28.34
that the Victorian parenting and grim public schools that form Dixon's case studies are

528
00:53:28.34 --> 00:53:32.34
relics of an irrelevant past, not true.

529
00:53:32.34 --> 00:53:37.42
American parenting and high schools have apparently contributed no less to military incompetence,

530
00:53:37.42 --> 00:53:39.22
consider the record.

531
00:53:39.22 --> 00:53:43.90
In World War I, General John Blackjack Pershing had to fire two American corps commander,

532
00:53:43.90 --> 00:53:49.94
six division commanders, and 1,400 brigadiers, colonels, and other officers for incompetence.

533
00:53:49.94 --> 00:53:54.38
This was remarkable carnage considering that America fought for just six months in that

534
00:53:54.38 --> 00:53:55.38
war.

535
00:53:55.38 --> 00:53:58.74
Damn.

536
00:53:58.74 --> 00:54:03.22
George C. Marshall, who served as a colonel on Pershing staff in World War I and then

537
00:54:03.22 --> 00:54:07.78
presided over the US Army and World War II as chief of staff was anything but incompetent.

538
00:54:07.78 --> 00:54:11.94
Marshall was in many ways the modern, the model general.

539
00:54:11.94 --> 00:54:18.26
Sounded mind and body he wrote in 1920 that an ideal officer was of, quote, the optimistic

540
00:54:18.26 --> 00:54:23.86
and resourceful type quick to estimate with relentless determination and possessed in addition

541
00:54:23.86 --> 00:54:30.50
a fund of sound common sense which operated to prevent gross errors due to rapidity of

542
00:54:30.50 --> 00:54:34.38
decision and action.

543
00:54:34.38 --> 00:54:39.86
For Hague optimism, and that's the World War I general, for Hague, optimism had been an

544
00:54:39.86 --> 00:54:42.26
abstract and silly concept.

545
00:54:42.26 --> 00:54:48.22
The spiritual willingness to always to attack for Marshall was a human concept.

546
00:54:48.22 --> 00:54:54.34
The spiritual inclination to see a glass is half full to find a way around difficulties

547
00:54:54.34 --> 00:54:55.34
and win in spite of them.

548
00:54:55.34 --> 00:54:57.42
That's a big difference.

549
00:54:57.42 --> 00:55:01.02
Hague thinks optimism is you just go.

550
00:55:01.02 --> 00:55:04.10
Marshall optimism is you figure out a way to win.

551
00:55:04.10 --> 00:55:09.50
It's a big, freaking difference.

552
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:13.90
You've been warning people for a little while now and I've been stealing this about the

553
00:55:13.90 --> 00:55:16.86
idea of lessons learned actually being a problem.

554
00:55:16.86 --> 00:55:18.42
There's some risk in there.

555
00:55:18.42 --> 00:55:24.26
As we fight against bias, you've talked about bias and a lot of ways and certainly on

556
00:55:24.26 --> 00:55:28.30
the leadership consultancy side when we're talking to people about ways to make sure that

557
00:55:28.30 --> 00:55:29.86
you don't run into problems in the future.

558
00:55:29.86 --> 00:55:35.34
Lessons learn can actually contribute to making mistakes in the future because you will

559
00:55:35.34 --> 00:55:40.14
pull these lessons thinking somehow that it sort of predetermines the next outcome with

560
00:55:40.14 --> 00:55:41.14
the situations the same.

561
00:55:41.14 --> 00:55:42.14
We know what the lessons are.

562
00:55:42.14 --> 00:55:43.14
We're going to apply those lessons.

563
00:55:43.14 --> 00:55:44.98
We're going to control the outcome.

564
00:55:44.98 --> 00:55:49.34
There's a little part of me just really struggling here hearing you read this.

565
00:55:49.34 --> 00:55:55.14
And yes, there's some hindsight being applied here, but how do you look at World War

566
00:55:55.14 --> 00:56:00.74
I, in reflect on that and say, we won.

567
00:56:00.74 --> 00:56:06.90
When you like barely didn't lose and you could play semantics all day long, yes, I

568
00:56:06.90 --> 00:56:10.42
know we won compared to the Germans who lost.

569
00:56:10.42 --> 00:56:15.14
But in a sense, this is a validation of the tactics that we input.

570
00:56:15.14 --> 00:56:22.66
This is a lesson learned of what we did work because we won and the idea that we can take

571
00:56:22.66 --> 00:56:28.42
that and capture this as a reinforcement that the things that we did were the right things,

572
00:56:28.42 --> 00:56:29.90
that's why we were successful.

573
00:56:29.90 --> 00:56:32.90
And setting and stone again, there's a lot of heights I hear.

574
00:56:32.90 --> 00:56:33.90
I understand that.

575
00:56:33.90 --> 00:56:40.06
Looking forward to knowing new in 1919, what was going to happen in 1940s, there was

576
00:56:40.06 --> 00:56:42.18
we have that understanding now.

577
00:56:42.18 --> 00:56:48.30
But even in that time, how do you look at that war and reinforce that what we did was

578
00:56:48.30 --> 00:56:50.74
the right thing when you're on the quote, winning side.

579
00:56:50.74 --> 00:56:51.74
It's insane.

580
00:56:51.74 --> 00:56:52.74
It's insane.

581
00:56:52.74 --> 00:56:57.98
We won.

582
00:56:57.98 --> 00:56:58.98
Yeah, we won.

583
00:56:58.98 --> 00:57:00.98
Let's do it again, Roger.

584
00:57:00.98 --> 00:57:05.34
Yeah, that's one of my favorite sarcastic favorite.

585
00:57:05.34 --> 00:57:10.98
Jitsu coaching calls is, oh, Kerry, that on-box not working, do it, harder.

586
00:57:10.98 --> 00:57:13.42
I've heard it.

587
00:57:13.42 --> 00:57:22.46
Marshall also insisted on flexibility of mind to nullify authoritarian tendencies.

588
00:57:22.46 --> 00:57:27.50
He blocked the rise of time servers and other mediocrities.

589
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:32.18
Marshall called them calamity howlers for the way they exaggerated difficulties and spun

590
00:57:32.18 --> 00:57:34.30
excuses for their failures.

591
00:57:34.30 --> 00:57:40.90
And noted that such leaders inexorably demoralized their units and infected them with negativity.

592
00:57:40.90 --> 00:57:47.54
Man, exaggerating your difficulties.

593
00:57:47.54 --> 00:57:52.14
Of the 42 senior generals who took part in the US Army's last maneuvers before Pearl Harbor,

594
00:57:52.14 --> 00:57:56.46
only 11 would command units in combat in World War II.

595
00:57:56.46 --> 00:57:58.82
That's freaking savage.

596
00:57:58.82 --> 00:57:59.82
That is savage.

597
00:57:59.82 --> 00:58:02.18
They were firing some people.

598
00:58:02.18 --> 00:58:04.74
The rest had to be fired or sidetracked as deadwood.

599
00:58:04.74 --> 00:58:09.70
Dozens of American generals will lose their posts in the course of the war.

600
00:58:09.70 --> 00:58:15.14
Your officer in American Army that expanded 35 fold in three years.

601
00:58:15.14 --> 00:58:18.90
Marshall put every candidate through his pace as shifting them into ever more burdensome

602
00:58:18.90 --> 00:58:22.14
and pressure-packed jobs promoting those who excelled.

603
00:58:22.14 --> 00:58:26.78
Those who fail, largely grimly noted, are out at the first sign of faltering.

604
00:58:26.78 --> 00:58:27.78
Which is interesting to me.

605
00:58:27.78 --> 00:58:31.50
I thought I immediately thought to myself, oh, so that's zero defect, right?

606
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:32.58
So now we're scared.

607
00:58:32.58 --> 00:58:35.46
But then it doesn't say failing.

608
00:58:35.46 --> 00:58:36.78
It says faltering.

609
00:58:36.78 --> 00:58:39.66
It means when the time to step up came, you might have made it.

610
00:58:39.66 --> 00:58:40.66
Okay, bad decision.

611
00:58:40.66 --> 00:58:41.90
Okay, well, you're okay.

612
00:58:41.90 --> 00:58:44.42
But if you faltered, what the do?

613
00:58:44.42 --> 00:58:45.42
You're out.

614
00:58:45.42 --> 00:58:47.42
Later, that's a huge difference.

615
00:58:47.42 --> 00:58:51.34
Maybe I'm reading a little bit too much into that, but I'll go with it.

616
00:58:51.34 --> 00:58:52.90
It's a pretty specific word to choose there.

617
00:58:52.90 --> 00:58:53.90
Yeah, falter.

618
00:58:53.90 --> 00:58:54.90
Right, falter.

619
00:58:54.90 --> 00:58:55.90
Not fail.

620
00:58:55.90 --> 00:58:58.10
Not, you know.

621
00:58:58.10 --> 00:59:02.70
Marshall was the exception who proved the rule by 1944 and 1945.

622
00:59:02.70 --> 00:59:07.82
The United States enjoyed massive superiority over the Germans and men, tanks, guns, and aircraft

623
00:59:07.82 --> 00:59:09.74
yet plotted into Germany.

624
00:59:09.74 --> 00:59:15.50
The dynamism of 1943, when Doidey Eisenhower and Marshall had pruned the deadwood and

625
00:59:15.50 --> 00:59:20.90
shot younger officers up the latter was replaced with an emphasis on the particle teamwork

626
00:59:20.90 --> 00:59:24.54
that would harness America's material superiority.

627
00:59:24.54 --> 00:59:30.46
It was like war by general motors, with a risk of a corporate strategy, more concerned,

628
00:59:30.46 --> 00:59:32.66
not to lose than to win swiftly.

629
00:59:32.66 --> 00:59:39.90
This was precisely the attitude that shaped the post-war US Army and Korea in Korea and Vietnam.

630
00:59:39.90 --> 00:59:45.06
Officers could no longer be relieved for cause as that would generate embarrassing publicity

631
00:59:45.06 --> 00:59:51.78
and congressional inquiries so they were often left in their jobs.

632
00:59:51.78 --> 00:59:57.30
70-year-old Douglas MacArthur, who commanded the Korean War from Tokyo, possessed every trait

633
00:59:57.30 --> 01:00:04.62
of Dixen's most incursible authoritarian and committed every possible error, nearly precipitating

634
01:00:04.62 --> 01:00:10.26
an American defeat and World War III in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland's disastrous

635
01:00:10.26 --> 01:00:12.98
leadership was initially viewed with great hope.

636
01:00:12.98 --> 01:00:17.98
Westy succeeded a string of incompetence who had misconstrued the war, then given the South

637
01:00:17.98 --> 01:00:21.14
Vietnamese relentlessly bad advice on how to win.

638
01:00:21.14 --> 01:00:25.98
First Samuel, hanging sand, well, hanging sand, Williams, then Lieutenant Colonel, or

639
01:00:25.98 --> 01:00:32.94
then Lionel Splithead Magar, then Paul Haskin's, the last derided by Defense Secretary

640
01:00:32.94 --> 01:00:36.06
Robert McNamara as, quote, not worth a damn.

641
01:00:36.06 --> 01:00:39.02
Westmoreland was supposed to be different.

642
01:00:39.02 --> 01:00:45.50
But he proved the perfect military incompetent, dim, blinkered, unsure of himself, lost

643
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:48.22
and unmore as a commander.

644
01:00:48.22 --> 01:00:52.98
He had actually refused to hire Vince Lambardi as coach of the Army football team when he

645
01:00:52.98 --> 01:00:57.90
was superintendent of West Point in 1960, quote, this was not the kind of man I wanted

646
01:00:57.90 --> 01:00:59.40
around cadets.

647
01:00:59.40 --> 01:01:01.74
Westy said of Lambardi.

648
01:01:01.74 --> 01:01:06.42
His game plan in Vietnam would be no shruter.

649
01:01:06.42 --> 01:01:10.34
One might ask how it could be otherwise the Vietnam War was directed by a particularly

650
01:01:10.34 --> 01:01:16.34
vexing incompetent general Maxwell Taylor, the ultimate pleaser who, as presidential military

651
01:01:16.34 --> 01:01:20.38
adviser Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then Ambassador South Vietnam flattered,

652
01:01:20.38 --> 01:01:24.56
first John F. Kennedy and then Lyndon Johnson in the believing that they could eat their

653
01:01:24.56 --> 01:01:25.96
cake and have it too.

654
01:01:25.96 --> 01:01:31.66
That is, fight the Vietnam War with limited means and public support and still win it.

655
01:01:31.66 --> 01:01:33.62
I read that, not great.

656
01:01:33.62 --> 01:01:36.70
Limited means and public support.

657
01:01:36.70 --> 01:01:40.26
He's saying limited means and limited public support and still win it.

658
01:01:40.26 --> 01:01:44.82
Like the military and civilian advisors gathered around George W. Bush in 2003, Taylor

659
01:01:44.82 --> 01:01:49.14
was obsessed with White House access and was willing to suppress conflicting opinions to

660
01:01:49.14 --> 01:01:53.22
conceal stubborn facts to keep it that way.

661
01:01:53.22 --> 01:01:58.18
On the ground in Saigon, Westmoreland, rather too eagerly brought Taylor's fraudulent

662
01:01:58.18 --> 01:02:04.74
talking points to life and Westy, after all, was just the sort of average Joe who got

663
01:02:04.74 --> 01:02:08.26
his ticket punched in the US Army of the 1960s.

664
01:02:08.26 --> 01:02:13.26
He'd never been to Staff or War College, only to a cooks and baker school and then a

665
01:02:13.26 --> 01:02:16.26
13 week management course at Harvard.

666
01:02:16.26 --> 01:02:21.18
He never read so Harvard Business School formed him into a McNamara-like organization

667
01:02:21.18 --> 01:02:26.58
man, all charts and graphs that PowerPoint general avant la lecture.

668
01:02:26.58 --> 01:02:29.30
I don't know what avant la lecture mean.

669
01:02:29.30 --> 01:02:30.82
I had to look that up.

670
01:02:30.82 --> 01:02:35.02
Means he was a PowerPoint general before there was such a thing as a PowerPoint general.

671
01:02:35.02 --> 01:02:38.06
Literally means before the letter.

672
01:02:38.06 --> 01:02:44.90
His search and destroy strategy was an unmitigated disaster, not least because of the destroying

673
01:02:44.90 --> 01:02:49.54
the world went on in the south, not in the north of Vietnam.

674
01:02:49.54 --> 01:02:53.98
Westy dog at least sheld bomb burned in poisoned hundreds of villages, succeeding mainly and

675
01:02:53.98 --> 01:02:57.74
increasing the number of insurgents and losing support of the South Vietnamese people.

676
01:02:57.74 --> 01:03:03.94
The United States dropped twice as many bombs on allied South Vietnam as on the enemy

677
01:03:03.94 --> 01:03:05.82
north.

678
01:03:05.82 --> 01:03:10.38
More bombs in fact that have been dropped in all theaters in World War II.

679
01:03:10.38 --> 01:03:12.86
Westmoreland's mantra was firepower.

680
01:03:12.86 --> 01:03:19.46
Like Dickson's incompetence, he hid in the only thing that he and artillery man knew.

681
01:03:19.46 --> 01:03:24.10
A man intending to lose a war could hardly have done it with more efficiency.

682
01:03:24.10 --> 01:03:27.10
That's a freaking rough assessment.

683
01:03:27.10 --> 01:03:31.30
The fact that his civilian commanders were no more acute in their judgment in no way

684
01:03:31.30 --> 01:03:37.18
excused his incompetent strategy he was relieved in 1968.

685
01:03:37.18 --> 01:03:43.18
The Iraq War reprise the Vietnam and competence with the incurious unassertive Tommy

686
01:03:43.18 --> 01:03:50.14
Frank succeeded by General Ricardo Sanchez, who won historian labeled the William Westmoreland

687
01:03:50.14 --> 01:03:55.10
of the Iraq War Sanchez at leap from division to army command and was the embodiment

688
01:03:55.10 --> 01:03:56.98
of the Peter principle.

689
01:03:56.98 --> 01:04:02.26
As a state department onlooker set of him, all trees no forest, not a strategic or political

690
01:04:02.26 --> 01:04:08.58
fought. When General David Petraeus took over in 2007, he introduced effective counter-insert

691
01:04:08.58 --> 01:04:13.78
counter-insertancy strategy but too late to prevent the dissolution of Iraq and desectarian

692
01:04:13.78 --> 01:04:18.02
fragments or to buttress plummeting American support for the war.

693
01:04:18.02 --> 01:04:23.66
Senator Chuck Hagle asked the marvellously prophetic question about Petraeus's troops

694
01:04:23.66 --> 01:04:32.82
search. What if the point of bringing the violence down with US troops if it will merely

695
01:04:32.82 --> 01:04:36.06
resume once the US troops are withdrawn?

696
01:04:36.06 --> 01:04:43.14
Hagle had served as a grunt in Vietnam. He knew military folly when he saw it.

697
01:04:43.14 --> 01:04:48.90
Nixon's deactailed case study ends in 1944, but he has a go at more recent history in

698
01:04:48.90 --> 01:04:57.26
the last chapter, surveying the martial lunacy of Vietnam and the staggering irrationality

699
01:04:57.26 --> 01:05:04.70
of the Bay of Pigs invasion clearly implying that there is no end of military incompetence.

700
01:05:04.70 --> 01:05:10.02
Indeed, the military inept to to displayed in the decades since Vietnam most shatteringly

701
01:05:10.02 --> 01:05:14.50
in the Iraq War shows that military incompetence and its psychological roots cry out for

702
01:05:14.50 --> 01:05:20.58
continued study and application. This book is a template and deserves its classic reputation.

703
01:05:20.58 --> 01:05:26.58
On this psychology of military incompetence is also a vital corrective to what we are

704
01:05:26.58 --> 01:05:33.26
experiencing today. The uncritical adoration of veterans, troops and their officers by the

705
01:05:33.26 --> 01:05:38.94
American public and more ominously by presidential candidates in Congress.

706
01:05:38.94 --> 01:05:45.94
Living as we do in an age of nonstop semi war, the need for clear, unsendamental thinking

707
01:05:45.94 --> 01:05:50.14
is more important than ever. It has become routine for candidates running for commander

708
01:05:50.14 --> 01:05:55.18
and chief to describe their global strategies, Voss, quote, I would check with my generals

709
01:05:55.18 --> 01:05:58.08
and follow their advice and quote.

710
01:05:58.08 --> 01:06:03.02
Nixon jerks us back to reality with our civic responsibilities. What if the general or

711
01:06:03.02 --> 01:06:07.82
Admiral is an incompetent authoritarian blind to the true situation leading the country into

712
01:06:07.82 --> 01:06:12.66
a ditch? What if the general is a well-master authoritarian type who cannot learn from experience,

713
01:06:12.66 --> 01:06:18.46
who denies rationalizes, deflects blame and creates scapegoats? The last usually quote,

714
01:06:18.46 --> 01:06:20.30
the folks in Washington.

715
01:06:20.30 --> 01:06:27.90
Indeed, what deficient American commander has not made this his swan song quote.

716
01:06:27.90 --> 01:06:32.46
At least in blank, I knew who the enemy was. Here in Washington I don't.

717
01:06:32.46 --> 01:06:39.66
A failed Iraq war commander was the last to try that weas and old perennial that bloomed

718
01:06:39.66 --> 01:06:42.70
during Korean Vietnam too.

719
01:06:42.70 --> 01:06:49.70
Read this book, absorb its lessons and you will be on your guard against this infantilization

720
01:06:49.70 --> 01:06:57.02
to revere the uniform without first peering inside. Indeed, Nixon sites a path breaking

721
01:06:57.02 --> 01:07:03.02
swish child's psychologist in this regard quote, the adult who is under the dominion of

722
01:07:03.02 --> 01:07:12.94
unilateral respect for the elders and for tradition is really behaving like a child.

723
01:07:12.94 --> 01:07:17.02
That was just the forward of this book.

724
01:07:17.02 --> 01:07:24.06
That's Jeffrey Wawro. He wrote that in 2016 or that's when this edition is, I got an old

725
01:07:24.06 --> 01:07:29.74
tradition too. I got the old school hard cover one. Because I know when we, when this podcast

726
01:07:29.74 --> 01:07:34.46
comes out, people can go out and buy those old school ones. I've got mine. I tried to get as many

727
01:07:34.46 --> 01:07:38.30
of them as I could off the market.

728
01:07:40.62 --> 01:07:44.22
We roll into now in the Dixon's preface.

729
01:07:45.02 --> 01:07:48.70
And he starts this off and I probably could have, I probably could have and probably should have

730
01:07:48.70 --> 01:07:52.38
started off this whole podcast with this note that he makes out of the gate. He says,

731
01:07:52.38 --> 01:07:58.06
this book is not an attack upon the armed forces, no upon the norm upon the vast majority of

732
01:07:58.06 --> 01:08:04.14
senior military commanders who in time of war succeed in tasks which would make the running

733
01:08:04.14 --> 01:08:09.66
of a large commercial enterprise seem like child's play by comparison. So, I should have

734
01:08:09.66 --> 01:08:14.06
started the podcast with that. Because let's face it. They're going to go hard in the paint.

735
01:08:14.06 --> 01:08:21.82
We're already feeling that. And it can be very easy to think that any critique of the leadership

736
01:08:21.82 --> 01:08:28.62
of these wars or people in leadership position specifically, it can be very easy to interpret

737
01:08:28.62 --> 01:08:33.82
this as shots at those people. But really, and I think this is what's going to be done in the book,

738
01:08:33.82 --> 01:08:41.98
too, is it's going to be more a breaking down of these leadership, failing leadership tactics

739
01:08:41.98 --> 01:08:49.82
and leadership roles or how these guys are doing it more so than these guys themselves.

740
01:08:49.82 --> 01:08:57.26
You know what I mean? In my close there. Unfortunately not. No, Dixing goes hard. Dixing goes hard

741
01:08:57.26 --> 01:09:00.62
in the paint. He's just straight calling these guys out. He's just guys are going to get called out.

742
01:09:00.62 --> 01:09:04.38
Okay. Well, based on his note there in the preface he sounded like he was going to go a little

743
01:09:04.38 --> 01:09:08.78
different route. But he's going hard. Yeah, he goes hard. He goes hard. There's no punches

744
01:09:08.78 --> 01:09:14.94
brought to that. But he but and he doesn't spend as much time. He does he does talk about some of the

745
01:09:14.94 --> 01:09:21.18
good military leaders. But he spends most of his time talking about the bad military leaders and how

746
01:09:21.18 --> 01:09:25.90
just bad they were and why they were bad and the mistakes that they made. And it wasn't like,

747
01:09:25.90 --> 01:09:30.62
well, he was really making a good decision based on the information he had. No, he wasn't.

748
01:09:30.62 --> 01:09:34.22
Right. He was, you know, we're going to get some stories that make you sick your stomach.

749
01:09:34.22 --> 01:09:37.58
Oh, shit. Some of these stories will make you sick your stomach. And you know, Dixing

750
01:09:37.58 --> 01:09:42.62
served a World War II. Dixing was wounded. Right. This guy knows what's up. He's probably had some

751
01:09:42.62 --> 01:09:51.66
incompetent leaders. So he's going to go hard. But the and look, I served with incredible

752
01:09:51.66 --> 01:09:58.38
leaders in the military, incredible leaders, incredible individual. I don't know if there could be

753
01:09:58.38 --> 01:10:03.66
better leaders than some of the leaders I served with the military. So this book isn't an attack on

754
01:10:03.66 --> 01:10:10.54
the armed forces or all leaders neither am I. And that's not what we're doing here. But

755
01:10:10.54 --> 01:10:19.58
there are some bad seats. And we need to learn from that. Because there's some legit things you can

756
01:10:19.58 --> 01:10:25.34
do to take corrective measures and watch out for this, especially if just like everything else,

757
01:10:25.34 --> 01:10:32.94
if you aim this book at yourself. If you aim this book at yourself and you every time I hear

758
01:10:32.94 --> 01:10:38.38
a four every time I say a fouritarian theme instead of thinking like about your boss or about

759
01:10:38.38 --> 01:10:43.74
some subordinate leader that you have, if you instead think, oh, how am I a fouritarian?

760
01:10:43.74 --> 01:10:49.34
Because that doesn't, oh, I do that. Oh, I'd lean in that direction. If you start thinking like that

761
01:10:49.34 --> 01:10:54.06
right now, that's that's the benefit. That's what you should be trying to do.

762
01:10:57.42 --> 01:10:59.34
Pretty much a webbed. I have my page and notes here.

763
01:10:59.34 --> 01:11:04.94
Oh, I just did I just reject your notes? No, that's legit, man. I kept, I, you know, like I've said

764
01:11:04.94 --> 01:11:09.66
this a thousand times. I get the cool part about being on the podcast. I hear this stuff in person

765
01:11:09.66 --> 01:11:13.74
live for the first time. Did you order this book when I told you ordered it like a year ago? Yes.

766
01:11:13.74 --> 01:11:18.30
We, but you've been sending me screenshots of like you've been dabbling with this thing for a while.

767
01:11:18.30 --> 01:11:25.10
I know this thing's common. So it's cool. But it's still mostly brand new. Like then

768
01:11:25.66 --> 01:11:31.42
this is all new and I get to write stuff down and part of it is just to think about how this

769
01:11:31.42 --> 01:11:36.22
makes sense in my own head. And I wrote down like five minutes ago. There's a lot of risk with this book.

770
01:11:36.94 --> 01:11:41.50
And the risk as I'm listening to you is that it's going to be a validation for the listeners

771
01:11:42.06 --> 01:11:45.74
that there's a bunch of other screwed up people out there and they're the problem.

772
01:11:46.54 --> 01:11:50.62
Oh, the other people. The other people. Yeah. And why wrote down and go, you mitigate that risk

773
01:11:50.62 --> 01:11:56.86
by this by assuming this guy is talking to you. Not about other people. He's talking about you.

774
01:11:56.86 --> 01:12:02.38
And the risk that you are a reflection of those behaviors and the only other thing I wrote down that

775
01:12:03.34 --> 01:12:07.82
that I was thinking about in sort of anticipation of this is that it's not just these individuals

776
01:12:08.86 --> 01:12:13.66
as flawed as they are. And I'm glad that we are, I'm glad all of us are taking a minute to go,

777
01:12:13.66 --> 01:12:17.90
hey, listen, this is not just us taking shots at all these people in the military to be critical of them.

778
01:12:18.46 --> 01:12:22.06
Because leading us hard, the military is hard. And there's a whole bunch of reasons.

779
01:12:22.06 --> 01:12:27.90
But there are flawed individuals, the other piece that compounds that for this, which is again,

780
01:12:27.90 --> 01:12:33.42
something we can all think about is that there is a system that promotes that, that validates that,

781
01:12:33.42 --> 01:12:38.22
that reinforces that it helps create and take the worst of these behaviors and magnify them.

782
01:12:38.86 --> 01:12:45.26
And does your company, does your team, does your family, does your household, does your business

783
01:12:45.26 --> 01:12:52.54
do the exact same thing? And just to add one more little thing that you said, which is 100%

784
01:12:52.54 --> 01:13:00.78
right, you're right. The military can in many ways take these people with these tendencies and promote

785
01:13:00.78 --> 01:13:06.94
them. They can do that. It also even prior to that attracts these people. Because you know,

786
01:13:06.94 --> 01:13:12.54
if you're a military and a person likes things to be controlled, likes uniformity.

787
01:13:12.54 --> 01:13:19.74
What, you know, if you're a in college and you like uniformity and you're looking at your dorm room going

788
01:13:19.74 --> 01:13:22.94
gosh, I wish everyone would just be quiet and you're like, oh, you're not enjoying them.

789
01:13:22.94 --> 01:13:27.74
I'm going to join the military. The idea of rank to that person. Exciting. You mean,

790
01:13:27.74 --> 01:13:34.54
you mean to tell me, yeah, I put this on and people will listen to me. They'd have to do what I say.

791
01:13:34.54 --> 01:13:40.94
I'm in. The idea of uniformity is not a bad thing. It's an attractive thing.

792
01:13:40.94 --> 01:13:48.54
We literally wear a uniform that attribute is a positive in so many ways for those of us

793
01:13:48.54 --> 01:13:53.10
interested in the military. So just to both of what you're saying, that idea, like, oh, those things

794
01:13:53.10 --> 01:13:59.02
you go, man, I don't want a bunch of yes men uniform thinking, you know, a group think. Actually,

795
01:13:59.02 --> 01:14:04.30
uniformity is hailed as a positive attribute in many ways across the military. So much so I like

796
01:14:04.30 --> 01:14:09.18
100% the more you look like the person next to you, the better you are. Yes. And that uniform

797
01:14:09.18 --> 01:14:14.62
looks exactly like this regulation. You're my guy. Yeah, you think about who's getting attracted to this.

798
01:14:14.62 --> 01:14:19.42
Look, do you get guys men and women that are patriotic, men and women that want a challenge,

799
01:14:19.42 --> 01:14:23.90
men and women that want to take care of their people and meet absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely.

800
01:14:23.90 --> 01:14:27.58
You do. I get all kinds of it. Do you get someone that just wants to put that right in

801
01:14:27.58 --> 01:14:33.58
going and finally get less and two, lieutenant Callie, right? In a norm, they, you know, you do

802
01:14:33.58 --> 01:14:37.98
read the backstory on Lieutenant Callie from the, from the Meelei masquer. It's like, oh, he was

803
01:14:39.02 --> 01:14:43.42
unknown, respected in his life. He had to go through OCS a bunch of times. He wanted that freaking

804
01:14:43.42 --> 01:14:49.42
rank so bad. It was probably like the most rewarding thing he ever got. It was to get that

805
01:14:49.42 --> 01:14:53.66
finally, get that rank and people just shot up and listen to me. So that's what you, that's what you're

806
01:14:53.66 --> 01:14:57.34
tracking. So we, are you doing that in your company? What kind of people you're tracking in your company?

807
01:14:57.34 --> 01:15:07.98
Scary. It is however an attempt to explain how I'm a minority of individuals come to inflict upon

808
01:15:07.98 --> 01:15:14.30
their fellow men, depths of misery and pain virtually unknown in other walks of life. That's freaking

809
01:15:14.30 --> 01:15:18.86
every step. Like, that's true. Like, hey, if you're a business and you're in the authoritarian,

810
01:15:18.86 --> 01:15:22.62
okay, cool, you're going to, you're going to drive some people crazy, whatever. Right?

811
01:15:22.62 --> 01:15:28.54
Well, you're in the military, you're causing depths of misery and pain virtually unknown in all

812
01:15:28.54 --> 01:15:34.22
other walks of life. This book involves the putting together of contributions from a great many

813
01:15:34.22 --> 01:15:38.70
people, a historian, sociologist, psychologist, and, of course, soldiers and sailors. It is hope

814
01:15:38.70 --> 01:15:43.74
that none of these will feel misrepresented in the final picture, which their contributions make.

815
01:15:43.74 --> 01:15:50.14
For air is a fact, and for the opinions expressed, I alone take full responsibility. Okay,

816
01:15:50.14 --> 01:15:56.70
stay in some ownership. In the writing of this book, I also owe a great debt of data to gratitude

817
01:15:56.70 --> 01:16:01.18
to all those who gave generously of their time to reading and discussing earlier drafts,

818
01:16:01.18 --> 01:16:05.74
their encouragement, criticisms, and advice had been invaluable, and he goes on to think about

819
01:16:05.74 --> 01:16:12.30
a freaking page and a half of people, names, names, names, names, names, names, and then finally,

820
01:16:12.30 --> 01:16:17.10
he gets to this port. And by the way, one thing that's interesting, that you couldn't have

821
01:16:17.10 --> 01:16:21.90
predicted is this guy is really funny. He's got that dry British humor, humor throughout the

822
01:16:21.90 --> 01:16:28.62
entire book, and he's awesome. So he brings the heat. Now, you know, you carry like, I'm sure he's

823
01:16:28.62 --> 01:16:32.38
not, you know, take it. Oh, he's taking shots, not as he takes shots, but some of them are pretty

824
01:16:32.38 --> 01:16:39.98
damn funny. So he says this, he says, finally, I owe a debt of gratitude to that handful of people

825
01:16:39.98 --> 01:16:45.66
who would probably prefer to remain nameless, whose hostility and dismay that anyone should write

826
01:16:45.66 --> 01:16:53.90
a book on military incompetence, provided considerable, if unlocked for confirmation of the relationship

827
01:16:53.90 --> 01:16:59.26
between militarism and human psychology. So like, all you do is the like, you shouldn't write a book,

828
01:16:59.26 --> 01:17:09.82
like exactly, you're the reason why. You are the reason why. So that's his opening. Now we get into

829
01:17:09.82 --> 01:17:15.50
chapter one. Like I said, this is going to be a slow roll with this book. It starts off with a quote

830
01:17:15.50 --> 01:17:24.38
at least it's a really short book. Yeah, classmates. We only wish to represent things as they are

831
01:17:24.38 --> 01:17:29.74
and to expose the error of believing that a mere Bravo without intellect can make himself

832
01:17:29.74 --> 01:17:35.34
distinguished in war. And Bravo can be used as a noun. I found out after reading that quote.

833
01:17:35.98 --> 01:17:40.54
Means someone that's like a daring man. Daring man isn't good enough.

834
01:17:40.54 --> 01:17:48.54
But now most people have been have become accustomed to one might almost say,

835
01:17:48.54 --> 01:17:55.10
blaze about military incompetence. Like the common cold, flat feet, or the British climate,

836
01:17:55.10 --> 01:17:59.74
it is accepted as part of life, faintly ludicrous, but quite unavoidable.

837
01:17:59.74 --> 01:18:02.94
Surely there can be nothing left to say about the subject. Please come out of the gate,

838
01:18:02.94 --> 01:18:07.74
look, wave, yeah, military incompetence, whatever. So it is like flat feet. Some people got it.

839
01:18:07.74 --> 01:18:14.38
In fact, military incompetence is largely preventable, tragically expensive and quite absorbing

840
01:18:14.38 --> 01:18:19.66
segment of human behavior. It also follows certain laws, it's a bold statement.

841
01:18:21.02 --> 01:18:28.06
The first intimation of this came to the writer during the solitary reading about notorious military

842
01:18:28.06 --> 01:18:34.46
disasters. These moving often horrific accounts evoked a curious deja vu experience. For there

843
01:18:34.46 --> 01:18:40.94
was something about these apparently senseless goings on, which sent one's thoughts along new channels,

844
01:18:40.94 --> 01:18:46.78
making contact with phenomena from quite other, hitherto unrelated context, and then back again

845
01:18:46.78 --> 01:18:53.66
to the senseless facts. Not now quite so senseless until gradually a theme continues as a

846
01:18:53.66 --> 01:18:58.86
hairline crack could be discerned throughout the stirring tales of daring due. Those big sentence.

847
01:18:58.86 --> 01:19:05.02
What's he saying in that? What he saying is he started reading about all these military disasters,

848
01:19:05.02 --> 01:19:08.14
and as he read them, he would think about another one and he'd think about another one. And what he

849
01:19:08.14 --> 01:19:14.94
started to see was a thread that connected them all together. If this pattern was real and it

850
01:19:14.94 --> 01:19:19.90
meant one it seemed to mean certain predictions would follow. These were tested and found correct.

851
01:19:19.90 --> 01:19:24.94
Yet other pieces began falling into place until gradually the mosaic of elements took on the

852
01:19:24.94 --> 01:19:29.58
semblance of a theory. This book is about that theory. It is concerned with placing aspects of

853
01:19:29.58 --> 01:19:36.78
military behavior in the context of general psychological principles. This sounds fine. A cheerful

854
01:19:36.78 --> 01:19:41.34
marriage of history and psychology. Unfortunately, however, such a union may not be entirely

855
01:19:41.34 --> 01:19:47.26
agreeable to some of potential in laws. Judging from the attitude of some historians, putting together

856
01:19:47.26 --> 01:19:51.82
of psychology and history is to say the least bad form while putting together of psychology and

857
01:19:51.82 --> 01:19:56.86
military history is positively indecent. There are at least two reasons for this anxiety. The

858
01:19:56.86 --> 01:20:02.14
first is that since there are a few things more annoying than having one's behavior explained,

859
01:20:02.14 --> 01:20:09.42
there exists a natural distaste for explanations of historical figures with whom one perhaps

860
01:20:09.42 --> 01:20:13.98
identifies. So he's saying, look, I'm going to write this book. It's about psychology. It's about

861
01:20:13.98 --> 01:20:21.18
military history, and that's not going to be popular. Because a lot of people relate to those military

862
01:20:21.18 --> 01:20:25.66
figures, those historical military figures. When you start talking about why they made those decisions,

863
01:20:25.66 --> 01:20:33.02
some people are going to get offended by that. So that's the first reason why this is a risky book.

864
01:20:33.90 --> 01:20:41.02
The second reason is a distrust of reductionism. Of the idea that anything so complex as a military

865
01:20:41.02 --> 01:20:47.34
disaster could possibly be reduced to explanations in terms of the workings of the human mind,

866
01:20:47.34 --> 01:20:54.78
and this by a psychologist of all people. So you can tell me all this stuff took place and it was

867
01:20:54.78 --> 01:20:59.82
because of this dude, you know, had a weird psychology about something. That's what we're going to say.

868
01:21:01.10 --> 01:21:06.70
An answer one can only say that his of course historians know more about history than do

869
01:21:06.70 --> 01:21:11.66
psychologists. Of course, historical events are determined by a complex set of variables.

870
01:21:11.66 --> 01:21:20.86
Political, economic, geographical, climactic, sociological, but ultimately history is made by

871
01:21:20.86 --> 01:21:27.42
human beings. And whatever other factors may have contributed to a military disaster, one of these

872
01:21:27.42 --> 01:21:34.30
was the minds of those who were there. And another, the behavior to which these minds gave rise.

873
01:21:34.30 --> 01:21:42.78
So there's all kinds of things that are plain into these disasters. And yes, the climate and the

874
01:21:42.78 --> 01:21:48.30
geography and the economics to all the things are plain into it. But you also had these human beings

875
01:21:48.30 --> 01:21:55.42
minds and how did their minds end up that way? Now these are complex variables. Hence, it has been

876
01:21:55.42 --> 01:21:59.50
necessary to play down the other factors in order to focus more clearly upon the psychological

877
01:21:59.50 --> 01:22:05.98
permanence. Consider the enogalous case of aircraft accidents. They've worked glad you're here.

878
01:22:06.86 --> 01:22:11.82
Nobody would deny that arrow planes crash for a number of different reasons. Sometimes,

879
01:22:12.46 --> 01:22:17.66
working independently, sometimes in unison. But this does not mean that the selecting out for

880
01:22:17.66 --> 01:22:22.86
particular study of a single factor such as metal fatigue necessitates dwelling on other such

881
01:22:22.86 --> 01:22:28.78
variables as bad weather in different navigation or too much alcohol in the bloodstream of the pilot.

882
01:22:29.98 --> 01:22:34.30
So just because the pilot was drunk doesn't mean you can't look at the metal fatigue that

883
01:22:34.30 --> 01:22:41.74
put on the wings. The case for a reductionist approach, however, also rests upon other considerations

884
01:22:41.74 --> 01:22:46.38
namely that the nature of military incompetence and those characteristics which distinguish

885
01:22:46.38 --> 01:22:51.02
competent from incompetent senior commanders have shown a significant lack of variation over the

886
01:22:51.02 --> 01:22:58.30
years despite changes in other factors which shape the course of history. So you see failure,

887
01:22:58.30 --> 01:23:04.30
failure failure failure, all these different failures. And there's been a lack of variation

888
01:23:04.62 --> 01:23:10.70
of what caused the failures from a psychological perspective even though the factors, the

889
01:23:10.70 --> 01:23:14.94
environment is totally changed. So it's not like, well, you know, you had horses. And so

890
01:23:14.94 --> 01:23:21.98
but you failed and you had tanks and you failed way to second. What's the common thread? Oh,

891
01:23:21.98 --> 01:23:28.62
the mind. Whether they are well equipped or ill equipped, whether they are in control of

892
01:23:28.62 --> 01:23:34.22
men who are armed with spears or tanks or rockets, whether they are English, Russian, German,

893
01:23:34.22 --> 01:23:39.82
Zulu, American, or French, good commanders pretty much remain the same. Likewise,

894
01:23:39.82 --> 01:23:44.38
bad commanders have much in common with the other which is what we say all of the time.

895
01:23:44.38 --> 01:23:50.30
Sometimes we'll get asked the question, well, you know, what makes this type of person a good

896
01:23:50.30 --> 01:23:55.34
leader? It doesn't matter what. It doesn't matter if they're a frontline infantry leader or a

897
01:23:55.34 --> 01:24:01.66
financial consultant company or a construction company. The leadership characteristics that make

898
01:24:01.66 --> 01:24:06.06
the good leaders are all the same. Humble leaders usually do better. No matter the situation. It's ridiculous.

899
01:24:08.14 --> 01:24:12.30
One reward rewarding byproduct of writing this book has been the many of joy-obile

900
01:24:12.30 --> 01:24:18.06
conversations I've had with people in the armed services. Here again, however, a small minority

901
01:24:18.06 --> 01:24:22.70
viewed the enterprise with dismay as something lacking in taste, if not actually boarding on

902
01:24:22.70 --> 01:24:25.90
sac religious. So he's having conversations with people telling he's going to write this book and

903
01:24:25.90 --> 01:24:32.46
they're like, well, why are you going to do that? He got a little footnote here. It says it is fair to

904
01:24:32.46 --> 01:24:37.18
add that certain common characteristics of those civilians and service men who took extreme view

905
01:24:37.18 --> 01:24:43.98
provided a very useful clue as to the possible origins of military incompetence. Yes.

906
01:24:46.14 --> 01:24:55.10
Sacrifice. You should not write a book like that. Okay. To this understandable sensitivity,

907
01:24:55.10 --> 01:25:00.46
I can only say that no insult is intended. In point of fact, for the devotees of the military

908
01:25:00.46 --> 01:25:06.22
to take exception to a study of military incompetence is as unjustified as it would be for

909
01:25:06.22 --> 01:25:11.98
admirers of teeth to complain about a book on dental carries, which means decay.

910
01:25:13.66 --> 01:25:19.34
In an imperfect world, the activities of professional fighters are presumably as necessary

911
01:25:19.34 --> 01:25:25.82
to society as those of police prostitutes, sewage disposers, and psychologists. It is just because

912
01:25:25.82 --> 01:25:30.54
we cannot do without these calling this, except possibly the last that any series attempt to

913
01:25:30.54 --> 01:25:34.54
understand the peculiarities should be welcomed and indeed taken as a compliment.

914
01:25:34.54 --> 01:25:40.86
For it is a token of their importance that we should merit such attention. So we're freaking,

915
01:25:40.86 --> 01:25:46.86
you got to be kidding me. Why wasn't this book? Why isn't there just like decades of these books

916
01:25:46.86 --> 01:25:55.42
being written for every situation, every war that's taking place? Moreover, is only by

917
01:25:55.42 --> 01:26:00.14
contemplation of the incompetent that we can appreciate the difficulties and accomplishment of the

918
01:26:00.14 --> 01:26:04.62
competent. If there were no incompetent generals that might appear that the interaction of armies and the

919
01:26:04.62 --> 01:26:08.62
waging of war were easy, task well within the compass of all who had the good fortune to reach the

920
01:26:08.62 --> 01:26:13.58
highest levels of military organizations. However, it is not only when contrasted with the

921
01:26:13.58 --> 01:26:18.70
inept that great commanders look their best, but also when seen in context of the organizations

922
01:26:18.70 --> 01:26:23.90
to which they belong. The thesis will be developed that the possibility of incompetence springs

923
01:26:23.90 --> 01:26:28.22
in large measure from the unfortunate, if unavoidable side effects of creating armies and

924
01:26:28.22 --> 01:26:33.10
naivies. This is to your point earlier, Dave. We create these things and they kind of produce,

925
01:26:33.10 --> 01:26:37.58
or at least have a tendency to produce incompetence. And therefore, when you're a good leader

926
01:26:37.58 --> 01:26:42.78
inside of an organization that produces incompetence, you're actually doing double good. You get two

927
01:26:42.78 --> 01:26:49.74
gold stars. For the most part, these tend to produce a leveling down of human capability at once

928
01:26:49.74 --> 01:26:53.98
encouraging to the mediocre, but cramping to the gifted, but cramping to the gifted,

929
01:26:53.98 --> 01:26:59.82
viewed in this light, those who would perform brilliantly in the caring of arms may be considered

930
01:26:59.82 --> 01:27:05.74
twice blessed. I guess I just stole that from him. For they achieved success, despite

931
01:27:07.98 --> 01:27:13.26
bad features of the organization to which they happened to belong. This alone would seem to

932
01:27:13.26 --> 01:27:17.10
justify an unabashed excursion to the realms of military incompetence, but there are additional

933
01:27:17.10 --> 01:27:23.90
grounds if anything, more pressing, they concern the related issues of cost and probability.

934
01:27:25.90 --> 01:27:32.46
While few would dispute that the cost grows exponentially with the growth of technology, so that

935
01:27:32.46 --> 01:27:38.94
the price of wrong decisions must now be reckoned in mega deaths. The chance of military incompetence

936
01:27:38.94 --> 01:27:45.26
remains a matter for debate. We might hope that this would be a declining function for better

937
01:27:45.26 --> 01:27:51.58
education, more realistic values, greater fear of immeasurably worse consequences and an increased

938
01:27:51.58 --> 01:27:58.06
decrease in jingoism. But there are strong grounds for taking the pessimistic view that the chance

939
01:27:58.06 --> 01:28:03.18
like the cost continues to increase with positive acceleration. This is getting worse. What are you saying?

940
01:28:03.18 --> 01:28:07.90
Hey, don't you think I look if you were going to go out and fight with swords and you are a bad

941
01:28:07.90 --> 01:28:13.90
leader, you're probably going to get a 50 guy is killed. Now you're going to go out and fight with

942
01:28:13.90 --> 01:28:19.66
artillery and machine guns. Now you're going to get a thousand people killed. We must be making

943
01:28:19.66 --> 01:28:27.26
improvement. We're not. In fact, it's getting worse. Several reasons may be advanced for this

944
01:28:27.26 --> 01:28:32.70
depressing hypothesis. Firstly, the gap between the capabilities of the human mind and the

945
01:28:32.70 --> 01:28:37.82
intellectual demands of modern warfare continues that expansion which started in the 18th century.

946
01:28:37.82 --> 01:28:43.02
It is probably opening from both sides while modern war becomes increasingly swift and deadly

947
01:28:43.02 --> 01:28:48.38
and the means by which it is waged, increasing the complex, the intellectual level of those

948
01:28:48.38 --> 01:28:55.66
entering the armed services as officers could well be on the wane. Ouch, he wrote this in 1976,

949
01:28:55.66 --> 01:29:01.98
just saying he's like, hey, if you go to the military right now, you know, this tentative

950
01:29:01.98 --> 01:29:06.38
supposition is based on the fact that fewer and fewer of the young consider the military to be a

951
01:29:06.38 --> 01:29:12.46
worthwhile career. Again, this is post-nomies right in this. One has only looked at contemporary

952
01:29:12.46 --> 01:29:17.26
recruiting advertisements to realize the evident difficulties of finding officer material. They

953
01:29:17.26 --> 01:29:23.26
spare nothing in their efforts to convince an unresponsive youth. The services are depicted as

954
01:29:23.26 --> 01:29:28.30
glittering toy shops where handsome young men enjoy themselves with tanks and missiles while

955
01:29:28.30 --> 01:29:34.46
basking in the respective lower ranks, hardly less godlike than themselves. In their eagerness to

956
01:29:34.46 --> 01:29:39.66
drum up applicants, these calls to arms attempt the mental contortion of presenting the services

957
01:29:39.66 --> 01:29:46.54
a classless society in which officers nevertheless remain gentlemen. The clear, clear, implica,

958
01:29:46.54 --> 01:29:52.78
implication of such expensive pleading can surely be that the market for a military career is shrinking

959
01:29:52.78 --> 01:29:59.58
to say the least to meet this fall off an officer recruitment. In sufficient has been done in the

960
01:29:59.58 --> 01:30:04.94
writer's opinion to improve the real as opposed to the advertised incentive value of military

961
01:30:04.94 --> 01:30:11.02
career. Again, this is written in the 70s. So you didn't have long lines at the recruiting offices

962
01:30:11.02 --> 01:30:18.30
in 1973. You can see how one might have this outlook on the military during that time.

963
01:30:18.30 --> 01:30:27.10
For sure. Yeah. Skip a little bit here. In short, possibly less able people are being

964
01:30:27.10 --> 01:30:34.14
called upon to carry out a more difficult task with a heavier price tag and the highest levels

965
01:30:34.14 --> 01:30:38.78
of responsibility, which are staggering. In the Vietnam War alone, the military commanders were

966
01:30:38.78 --> 01:30:43.74
responsible for executing policies which cost the United States $300 billion.

967
01:30:45.02 --> 01:30:49.82
Seems cheap now coming out of Afghanistan to trillion dollar price tag. They were responsible for

968
01:30:49.82 --> 01:30:55.10
releasing 13 million tons of high explosives more than six times the weight of bombs dropped by the

969
01:30:55.10 --> 01:30:59.66
United States and all theaters during the whole of the second world war. They were responsible for

970
01:30:59.66 --> 01:31:05.34
the delivery of 90,000 tons of gas and herbicides and they were responsible for the deaths of

971
01:31:05.34 --> 01:31:12.54
between one and two million people. These are great responsibilities. Ears of general ship on this scale

972
01:31:12.54 --> 01:31:18.38
would be very costly. Of course, many of the arguments put forward in this book are equally applicable

973
01:31:18.38 --> 01:31:25.34
to other human enterprises. That's why we're freaking interested in this stuff. Indeed,

974
01:31:25.34 --> 01:31:29.98
there is no reason to suppose that incompetence occurs more frequently in military subcultures

975
01:31:29.98 --> 01:31:35.02
than it does in politics, commerce, or the universities. There are, however, apart from the heavy

976
01:31:35.02 --> 01:31:39.82
cost of military disasters, special reasons for studying cases of military enough to do.

977
01:31:39.82 --> 01:31:43.90
So this applies to everywhere. That's why, I mean, this is what we do for a living in

978
01:31:43.90 --> 01:31:49.98
national and on front. This is what we do for a living. But he's going to call out the reasons why

979
01:31:49.98 --> 01:31:53.66
he's going to focus on the military. The first is that military organizations have a particularly

980
01:31:53.66 --> 01:31:59.66
propensity for attracting a minority of individuals who might prove a menace at high levels of command.

981
01:31:59.66 --> 01:32:05.02
And the second is that the nature of militarism serves to accentuate those very traits

982
01:32:05.02 --> 01:32:11.74
which might ultimately prove disastrous, which is what we just talked about. Dave Burke likes people

983
01:32:11.74 --> 01:32:17.50
to listen to him and he realizes there's the place he can go and put a freaking gold bar on his

984
01:32:17.50 --> 01:32:25.02
collar and he becomes the man. In theory, then, errors of general ship could be prevented by

985
01:32:25.02 --> 01:32:31.66
attention to these causes. You would think, thirdly, the public has, at least in the democracies,

986
01:32:32.38 --> 01:32:37.42
some real say as to who should make its political decisions. This does not apply to generals.

987
01:32:37.42 --> 01:32:44.38
So you look, we get to vote you out. If you're a president or you're a senator or you're a representative,

988
01:32:44.38 --> 01:32:50.06
we can vote you out. Chairman of a board, you know, look at business. Yeah. You know, anything like

989
01:32:50.06 --> 01:32:57.02
that, not the case here. Yeah, we can fire you from your position. 100%. Even the worst government

990
01:32:57.02 --> 01:33:01.50
and the most inept prime minister could come up for possible dismissal every so often,

991
01:33:01.50 --> 01:33:07.18
this is not true of armies and navies. We have, we may have the governments we deserve, but sometimes

992
01:33:07.66 --> 01:33:11.90
had the military minds which we did not. Fourthly, if one of the main differences between

993
01:33:11.90 --> 01:33:18.14
military and political organization, organizations is the degree of public control that

994
01:33:18.94 --> 01:33:27.82
between the military and commerce lies in decision payoffs. If he's got this notice, so relatively

995
01:33:27.82 --> 01:33:32.94
trivial and unimportant are most academic decisions that it would be arrogant to discuss them in the

996
01:33:32.94 --> 01:33:39.10
same breath. This guy takes shots at the academia quite a bit for a guy that's a freaking

997
01:33:39.10 --> 01:33:47.42
professor or he was a professor. A wrong decision by a company chairman or board of directors may

998
01:33:47.42 --> 01:33:51.82
cost a great deal of money and to press a sizable population of shareholders, but military

999
01:33:51.82 --> 01:33:57.26
or has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, lives and untold misery to civilians and soldiers

1000
01:33:57.26 --> 01:34:02.22
alike. But the case for a study of military and competence rests upon other issues. Not the

1001
01:34:02.22 --> 01:34:07.18
least of these is the need to examine a view of military behavior diametrically opposed to,

1002
01:34:07.18 --> 01:34:13.34
though in no way less extreme than that of people who would vehemently defend senior commanders

1003
01:34:13.34 --> 01:34:17.50
against even the faintest breath of criticism. Well, as I was talking about earlier, we think,

1004
01:34:17.50 --> 01:34:27.98
oh, this guy was in the military, so he must be square away. No. This other hypocritical stance

1005
01:34:27.98 --> 01:34:34.30
seems remarkably widespread. Thus, for many people with whom the author discussed a central topic

1006
01:34:34.30 --> 01:34:39.66
of this book, the notion of military and competence struck as an immediate and responsive court.

1007
01:34:39.66 --> 01:34:46.06
Rejoiners range from you will have no shortage of data to surely that's the whole of military history.

1008
01:34:46.06 --> 01:34:49.26
So when he told people was going to write this book, they go, oh yeah, you got plenty of data on

1009
01:34:49.26 --> 01:34:55.42
incompetence and isn't that just the entire military history? But when press for details,

1010
01:34:55.42 --> 01:35:02.06
there was a tendency to become vague and retire behind a 1066 and all that attitude to the subject

1011
01:35:02.06 --> 01:35:07.50
psychological causes were usually reduced to a single factor, low intelligence or as one historian

1012
01:35:07.50 --> 01:35:13.66
put it, the bloody fool theory of military history. So look, you got people that made bad decisions,

1013
01:35:13.66 --> 01:35:22.46
they were stupid. Doubtless this view has been contributed to by such books on military

1014
01:35:22.46 --> 01:35:28.94
ineptitude as Alan Clark's The Dunkies and a brace of critique of the generals of the first world war.

1015
01:35:28.94 --> 01:35:36.78
Certainly, it's title taken from the famous conversation between Ludenhurf, Ludenhurf and Hoffman

1016
01:35:36.78 --> 01:35:42.78
and such captions as Donkey Decorates Alliance. So this book, the Donkeys, this is a quote that

1017
01:35:42.78 --> 01:35:48.38
you guys ever heard the quote, Lions Led by Lambs. So here's the original quote, according to

1018
01:35:48.38 --> 01:35:56.22
the memoirs of Field Marshal Vaughan, Falcon Hein, side by Own Clark Field Marshal, then Ludenhürf's

1019
01:35:56.22 --> 01:36:04.22
comment, the English soldiers fight like Lions was greeted by his friend, major general Max Hoffman

1020
01:36:04.22 --> 01:36:12.22
with true, but don't we know they are Lions Led by Donkeys and they got a picture in this book

1021
01:36:12.22 --> 01:36:19.42
of some general giving a young soldier own award and the caption is Donkey Decorates Alliance.

1022
01:36:19.42 --> 01:36:27.90
The contents of this book imply however that while stupidity may have possibly played a part,

1023
01:36:27.90 --> 01:36:31.82
limited intelligence was certainly not the cause of the behavior for which the generals have been

1024
01:36:31.82 --> 01:36:38.38
criticized. Judging from the spate of books among which the donkey, the donkey's appeared, it looked

1025
01:36:38.38 --> 01:36:46.94
as if the taboo had been lifted on peering into the military wood shed. But mixing our real metaphors,

1026
01:36:46.94 --> 01:36:54.06
the Ernst Walsh sacred cows were once more being transmorgified into nothing more than

1027
01:36:54.06 --> 01:37:01.90
very unsecret asses. Transmorgified, had to look that word up. What is the, it means magically change,

1028
01:37:02.54 --> 01:37:08.78
that magically changed. So transmorgified. Thus one historian has described a series of military

1029
01:37:08.78 --> 01:37:14.78
misapps to bone-headed leadership, another spoke of quote, the long gallery of military

1030
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:20.38
immacility while a third has set of British soldiers that their fate was decided for them by idiots.

1031
01:37:21.82 --> 01:37:27.18
So that's what they're normally, you know, this guy was just stupid. And as you read this,

1032
01:37:27.18 --> 01:37:31.50
as you read this book, you realize these are smart people in many cases. And that's such a

1033
01:37:31.50 --> 01:37:37.50
dismissive take on that, you know, it's just like, oh, that guy was dumb, you know, it

1034
01:37:37.50 --> 01:37:43.58
yeah, that's exactly the point he's making. Right. Is oh yeah, the guy was just stupid.

1035
01:37:45.58 --> 01:37:51.34
And you know what's funny is how often do you, how often did you hear throughout your life? Oh, yeah,

1036
01:37:51.34 --> 01:37:56.62
that guy's smart has no common sense. Right. That's like a common thing. Oh, that guy's,

1037
01:37:56.62 --> 01:38:03.98
all of us say always really book smart, which is a dig. Right. It doesn't matter how smart you are,

1038
01:38:03.98 --> 01:38:07.82
if you can't make good decisions. And these people are actually smart in many cases.

1039
01:38:10.62 --> 01:38:15.58
The view taken here is that besides being unkind, these views are probably invalid, the hypothesis

1040
01:38:15.58 --> 01:38:19.90
of intellectual, intellectual incapacity leaves two questions quite unanswered how if they are so

1041
01:38:19.90 --> 01:38:24.30
lacking intelligence, do people become senior military commanders, which is an accurate same in,

1042
01:38:24.30 --> 01:38:29.98
mean you can't be a senior military commander if you're stupid. Maybe maybe occasionally.

1043
01:38:29.98 --> 01:38:34.62
And what is it about military organizations that they should attract, promote, and ultimately tolerate

1044
01:38:34.62 --> 01:38:41.34
those whose performance at the highest levels may destroy the organizations that they represent.

1045
01:38:41.34 --> 01:38:46.22
To answer those, these questions, however, it is first necessary to discover what the job of

1046
01:38:46.22 --> 01:38:52.30
general ship entails and how it could be done so badly or so well. This, the bare bones of

1047
01:38:52.30 --> 01:38:56.46
good and bad general ship is examined in the next chapter in terms of information theory.

1048
01:38:56.46 --> 01:39:02.86
Okay, as I was going through this book trying to decide what, what I'm going to read,

1049
01:39:02.86 --> 01:39:10.30
I just had to go hard in these first couple chapters to lay down the background, the context.

1050
01:39:10.30 --> 01:39:15.74
And so it's almost like all that right there is starting head towards what we're talking about.

1051
01:39:17.18 --> 01:39:20.46
The main part of this book is divided in two halves. The first is concerned with case histories,

1052
01:39:20.46 --> 01:39:23.74
examples of military andeptitude over a period of some hundred years or so.

1053
01:39:23.74 --> 01:39:28.14
Much of this material will no doubt be all too familiar to the reader. It is included here

1054
01:39:28.14 --> 01:39:32.46
and the selections made with two main purposes in mind to provide an aid, memoria.

1055
01:39:33.34 --> 01:39:38.06
And because it is believed that common denominators of military and competence emerge most clearly

1056
01:39:38.06 --> 01:39:43.90
when looked at in a longitudinal study. One special virtue of this approach is that the highlights,

1057
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:49.90
it highlights the influence or more often regret, regrettable lack of influence of earlier

1058
01:39:49.90 --> 01:39:55.58
upon later events. So throughout he's covering these histories and as you cover these histories,

1059
01:39:56.38 --> 01:40:01.42
you can see that there's just nothing learned. You know, it's even, I guess maybe worse or at

1060
01:40:01.42 --> 01:40:06.54
least the same ballpark as you're talking about Dave. Oh, they took these lessons learned and they

1061
01:40:06.54 --> 01:40:10.46
made them rigid and just as bad as that as we just didn't learn anything.

1062
01:40:12.38 --> 01:40:17.98
For the most part, cases of incompetence have been taken from British military history

1063
01:40:17.98 --> 01:40:22.06
far from being unpatriotic. It's apparently one sided approach. Springs from a sentimental

1064
01:40:22.06 --> 01:40:28.38
regard for the forces of the Crown, whose record of valor and fighting ability is second to none

1065
01:40:28.38 --> 01:40:32.62
and whose ability to rise above the most intense provocation either from a civilian

1066
01:40:32.62 --> 01:40:38.14
population as in Northern Ireland today or from the lapses of their top leadership in days gone by

1067
01:40:38.14 --> 01:40:42.30
must surely occupy unique position in history of warfare. So he's like, hey, I'm going to talk about the

1068
01:40:42.30 --> 01:40:49.02
brets. Nothing against the brets. In fact, the brets have the unbelievable history, but

1069
01:40:49.82 --> 01:40:54.86
that's what we're going to look at. The second and half of the book is devoted to discussion

1070
01:40:54.86 --> 01:40:59.66
and explanation and is subdivided into two parts. The first concern with the social

1071
01:40:59.66 --> 01:41:04.70
psychology of military organizations and the second with the psychopathology of individual commanders.

1072
01:41:05.50 --> 01:41:10.70
And what's I'm telling you, I was like, oh, we'll maybe just do this. Maybe I'll just do that.

1073
01:41:10.70 --> 01:41:17.66
Maybe it's the one part. The context is so strong and he doesn't play around. He doesn't,

1074
01:41:17.66 --> 01:41:21.74
he isn't waiting till the end to start explaining things. He's doing it throughout the book. So

1075
01:41:23.02 --> 01:41:28.06
and as you said and as I said, you know, you got to aim this book yourself. Man, it's uncomfortable

1076
01:41:28.06 --> 01:41:34.38
sometimes. You're reading this thing. You're like, oh, oh, man. Like, oh, I did that. I did this.

1077
01:41:34.38 --> 01:41:41.10
You know, you can feel it. The approach here is essentially eclectic drawing upon

1078
01:41:42.06 --> 01:41:48.46
ethylogical psychoanalytic and behaviorist theories. It attempts to explain military and aptitude

1079
01:41:48.46 --> 01:41:55.98
in light of five inescapable if unfortunate features of human psychology. These are.

1080
01:41:57.26 --> 01:42:03.66
One, man shares with lower animals certain powerful instincts. And again, these are like the

1081
01:42:03.66 --> 01:42:11.10
root of what he's talking about. These five inescapable parts of our brains.

1082
01:42:12.62 --> 01:42:18.78
So we share with lower animals certain powerful instincts too. Unlike lower animals, most

1083
01:42:18.78 --> 01:42:26.06
men learn to control frustrate, direct and sublimate these instinctual energies. So

1084
01:42:26.70 --> 01:42:30.70
right, we got control over some of these things. At least we're supposed to. We can at least

1085
01:42:30.70 --> 01:42:37.34
frustrate them. That's a good word, right? We can at least frustrate them. Three. While by far the

1086
01:42:37.34 --> 01:42:43.34
largest part of this learning occurs in early childhood, it's effects upon adult personality

1087
01:42:43.34 --> 01:42:47.90
are profound and long lasting. Again, this is where you know, you get into like, you know,

1088
01:42:47.90 --> 01:42:51.74
Freud and how you're raised and all these little things that are in your childhood and they,

1089
01:42:51.74 --> 01:42:55.02
and I don't know if that's right or wrong. I don't know if that's right or wrong. Because I think

1090
01:42:55.02 --> 01:42:58.30
I've seen people that have been raised all kinds of different ways and end up all kinds of different ways.

1091
01:42:58.30 --> 01:43:04.30
But I think the end result is you end up with a personality. Regardless of where it comes from,

1092
01:43:04.30 --> 01:43:10.22
you end up with a certain personality or certain personality aspects that we can PID. We can identify

1093
01:43:12.86 --> 01:43:18.86
for residues of this early learning and in particular unresolved conflicts between infantile

1094
01:43:18.86 --> 01:43:26.62
desires and the demands of punitive morality may remain wholly unconscious yet provide a

1095
01:43:26.62 --> 01:43:34.62
canker of inexhaustible anxiety. Again, really tying our behaviors to what, how we got cheated when

1096
01:43:34.62 --> 01:43:40.62
we were kids and if you got, you know, the room had to be clean. You had to clean your plate. Like

1097
01:43:40.62 --> 01:43:45.98
all those little things. And again, chime in if you guys think I'm wrong. I've known people

1098
01:43:45.98 --> 01:43:51.34
that were raised in a totally strict environment and they end up on one of the spectrum and I've

1099
01:43:51.34 --> 01:43:55.58
known people that had raised in a totally strict environment, they end up in a totally different person.

1100
01:43:55.58 --> 01:43:59.74
Are there some root things that are overlapping sure? But I think we have to look

1101
01:44:01.90 --> 01:44:06.38
and maybe it's just the way psychologically things play out, you know, but

1102
01:44:08.14 --> 01:44:14.46
there there. Does he say unresolved? Yes. So I think that has, I think that word jumps out at me

1103
01:44:15.50 --> 01:44:22.62
the unresolved part. I think a lot of times people are able to come to terms with something from

1104
01:44:22.62 --> 01:44:29.02
their childhood and then cut own it right and move past it. I think it's the unresolved

1105
01:44:29.02 --> 01:44:35.02
part that lingers right where there's still, there's a bit of broken something there that hasn't

1106
01:44:35.02 --> 01:44:40.70
been addressed and because of that it continues to plague the individual as they try to move forward.

1107
01:44:40.70 --> 01:44:49.34
So maybe if I know you too and you both were raised in this super strict way and yet Kerry was like,

1108
01:44:49.34 --> 01:44:54.38
you know what, you know my mom was just a little bit crazy and that's cool and but Dave was like,

1109
01:44:55.26 --> 01:45:02.30
it couldn't let it go. Maybe that's what makes Dave a little bit harder than that respect or

1110
01:45:02.30 --> 01:45:08.62
maybe you're both raised by the hippie parents that didn't care and Kerry was like, yeah,

1111
01:45:08.62 --> 01:45:12.22
I don't need to care about anything. It's all good and Dave was like, I don't want to end up like that.

1112
01:45:12.22 --> 01:45:21.74
You end up with a more militaristic mindset or a trauma hippie mom wrecks the van. Johnny moves on,

1113
01:45:21.74 --> 01:45:34.46
you know Dave doesn't. Dave bears the scar right. I'll just say a little bit.

1114
01:45:34.46 --> 01:45:43.10
I really do. I think he does that. The last one, when this anxiety becomes the driving force

1115
01:45:43.10 --> 01:45:48.54
in life's endeavors, the fragile edifices of reason and competence are placed in jeopardy.

1116
01:45:48.54 --> 01:45:56.94
So that's scary. Again, regard for me, regardless of the source of this personality trait that you

1117
01:45:56.94 --> 01:46:04.70
end up with, if that be, it doesn't matter where it came from. If you have it and it becomes the driving

1118
01:46:04.70 --> 01:46:08.86
force in your endeavors, that's where we run into a problem. And I don't want to say it doesn't

1119
01:46:08.86 --> 01:46:15.34
matter where it came from, but regardless of what you think of that, we know someone that's

1120
01:46:16.38 --> 01:46:21.98
hyper either ego is out of control. It doesn't really matter, I shouldn't say it doesn't matter

1121
01:46:21.98 --> 01:46:24.78
where it came from, but there's nothing we can do about where it came from, but if I understand

1122
01:46:24.78 --> 01:46:29.66
that Dave has a massive ego, I'm not sitting there going, well, do I need to have him sit down on

1123
01:46:29.66 --> 01:46:36.06
the couch? Let's go hip-nutism and break down where he got this giant ego from or my,

1124
01:46:36.06 --> 01:46:40.22
I'm just going, okay, he's got a big giant ego. How do I work through this? How do I get this?

1125
01:46:40.22 --> 01:46:46.38
How do I approach him with ideas? So we can dwell on that a little bit, where these people,

1126
01:46:46.38 --> 01:46:50.30
how these people end up like this? And I think that is important to extend. Is if you can

1127
01:46:50.30 --> 01:46:56.30
understand somebody a little bit better, you can maneuver better, but regardless, they end up,

1128
01:46:56.30 --> 01:47:01.66
you end up with these personalities, different personalities. I knew a guy,

1129
01:47:03.74 --> 01:47:09.18
that's the, I mean, I know you know, there was a whole slew, because when I got in the navy,

1130
01:47:09.74 --> 01:47:13.66
so it's 1990, this had to be similar for you. There's a whole slew of my friends in the

1131
01:47:13.66 --> 01:47:18.62
sealed teams who parents were just straight hippies, just freaking hippies, like conceived

1132
01:47:18.62 --> 01:47:25.50
that would stock and whatever, like, just straight up hippies. And yet they took the most militaristic

1133
01:47:25.50 --> 01:47:34.38
life that they could, being a commando, right? So how's that work? Yeah, maybe it's a reaction

1134
01:47:34.38 --> 01:47:39.98
to that, you know? And vice versa, have you ever known someone that had that hardcore, strict religious

1135
01:47:39.98 --> 01:47:45.42
upbringing and what, how do they end up wild, freaking maniac? You know, I feel like that's the

1136
01:47:45.42 --> 01:47:51.82
generic go to, right where it's like the rebel, you know, came from that strict Catholics school,

1137
01:47:51.82 --> 01:47:57.10
you know, whatever, they just go the other way. And it's weird, because you, that's not,

1138
01:47:57.10 --> 01:48:00.70
neither one of these things is, oh, you went to a strict Catholic school, now you're up, no,

1139
01:48:00.70 --> 01:48:03.58
there's plenty of people that went to a strict Catholic school, they become strict Catholics.

1140
01:48:04.46 --> 01:48:09.90
So, that's, I think this is why, and again, I'm not a psychologist and I don't even know enough

1141
01:48:09.90 --> 01:48:15.50
about psychology, but I'm saying regardless of my opinion, because that's all it is, in opinion, the

1142
01:48:15.50 --> 01:48:19.90
result that you get is, oh, this person has a very rebellious attitude and he's in my platoon,

1143
01:48:19.90 --> 01:48:24.78
how do I deal with him? Or this person has a massive ego, he's in my platoon, how do I deal with him?

1144
01:48:29.58 --> 01:48:32.70
It says here in due course, we shall examine the scientific basis for these

1145
01:48:33.42 --> 01:48:37.82
propositions and their relevance to a theory of military incompetence, because this is a book

1146
01:48:37.82 --> 01:48:42.94
about incompetence, rather than competence, about disasters, rather than successes. These chapters

1147
01:48:42.94 --> 01:48:50.38
may appear to take an unnecessarily jondist view of the military profession and to dwell more upon

1148
01:48:50.38 --> 01:48:55.58
what is bad, rather than what is good, and man's attempts to professionalize violence.

1149
01:48:56.78 --> 01:49:04.22
But without teasing out and enlarging upon the less pleasant features of a multi-faceted phenomenon

1150
01:49:04.22 --> 01:49:09.50
there could be no theory to account for, those human aberrations which have caused so much

1151
01:49:09.50 --> 01:49:18.14
unnecessary suffering as war. As clouds wits, rotovor, this is the way in which the matter must be viewed

1152
01:49:18.14 --> 01:49:25.10
and it is to no purpose. It is even against one's better interest to turn away from the consideration

1153
01:49:25.10 --> 01:49:28.86
of the real nature of the affair because of the horror of its elements,

1154
01:49:28.86 --> 01:49:36.06
excites repungents. So we shouldn't not look at war just because it's freaking savage.

1155
01:49:38.06 --> 01:49:43.18
To the reader who recoils and discussed from these chapters, I can only say that the theory

1156
01:49:43.18 --> 01:49:49.98
they advance is based upon the emergence of a pattern of which each small piece may in itself

1157
01:49:49.98 --> 01:49:54.86
seem trivial, possibly ludicrous, even obnoxious, but which when put together with other pieces

1158
01:49:54.86 --> 01:50:01.18
begins to make sense. This interdependence between the parts necessitates keeping an open mind

1159
01:50:01.18 --> 01:50:06.30
and however much one may dislike or disbelieve the existence of the individual trees,

1160
01:50:06.30 --> 01:50:11.82
postponing judgment until the wood is seen in its entirety. For the reader who is obsessed with

1161
01:50:11.82 --> 01:50:16.94
trees and thinks that history should be left to historians, ideas about soldiering to soldiers,

1162
01:50:16.94 --> 01:50:21.74
and that psychological fear rising should never go below the belt. This is the moment to stop

1163
01:50:21.74 --> 01:50:29.58
reading and save yourself some irritation. We're rolling into chapter two, which is general ship.

1164
01:50:31.26 --> 01:50:35.82
War is the province of uncertainty three-force of those things upon which action in war must be

1165
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:42.86
calculated are hidden more or less in the crowds of great uncertainty. In a situation where the

1166
01:50:42.86 --> 01:50:47.82
consequences of wrong decisions are so awesome where a single bit of irrationality can set a

1167
01:50:47.82 --> 01:50:52.54
whole train of traumatic events in motion. I do not think that we can be satisfied with the

1168
01:50:52.54 --> 01:50:57.74
assurance that quote most people behave rationally most of the time and quote.

1169
01:51:00.06 --> 01:51:05.10
This is a quote that I say to clients all the time, hey people are crazy, including you.

1170
01:51:05.10 --> 01:51:08.86
You've got to deal with all these crazy people. So assuming that people are going to behave

1171
01:51:08.86 --> 01:51:13.50
rationally as a dumb thing to assume. And the additional layer that you already talked about

1172
01:51:13.50 --> 01:51:20.54
earlier is what's rational to me is not rational to you. So we're going to say expectations of what

1173
01:51:20.54 --> 01:51:24.46
I think you would do as you consider rationally like this is a totally rational thing for me to do and

1174
01:51:24.46 --> 01:51:29.18
it's exactly opposite what I would do. Which is crazy that you and I can have those two

1175
01:51:29.82 --> 01:51:32.46
opposite views. But that's the reality.

1176
01:51:36.14 --> 01:51:42.14
War is primarily concerned with two sorts of activity, the delivering of energy and the communication

1177
01:51:42.14 --> 01:51:46.46
of information. This is a crazy thing to think about the delivering of energy.

1178
01:51:48.94 --> 01:51:54.06
In war, each side is kept busy by turning its wealth into energy which is then delivered free,

1179
01:51:54.62 --> 01:52:00.70
gratis and for nothing to the other side. Such energy may be muscular, thermal,

1180
01:52:00.70 --> 01:52:06.54
kinetic or chemical. Wars are only possible because the recipients of this energy are ill-prepared

1181
01:52:06.54 --> 01:52:13.26
to receive it and convert it into useful form for their own economy. If by means of say,

1182
01:52:13.26 --> 01:52:17.82
impossibly large funnels and gigantic reservoirs, they could capture and store the energy

1183
01:52:17.82 --> 01:52:22.70
flowing at them by the other side, the recipients of this unsolicited gift would soon be rich.

1184
01:52:22.70 --> 01:52:27.82
So and the other side so poor that further warfare would be unnecessary for them and impossible

1185
01:52:27.82 --> 01:52:31.42
for their imponer opponents. It's a very interesting way to it.

1186
01:52:31.42 --> 01:52:39.10
I've never heard it. Put that way. It's the truth. It is. Creating energy and thucking it

1187
01:52:39.10 --> 01:52:43.50
at the other side for free for free. And only because they can't handle it.

1188
01:52:45.18 --> 01:52:48.62
Unfortunately such levels of technology have not been reached and have yet not more alone.

1189
01:52:48.62 --> 01:52:54.46
The United States delivered to Indo-China enough energy to displace 3.4 billion cubic yards

1190
01:52:54.46 --> 01:52:59.82
of Earth 10 times the amount dug out for the canals of Suez and Panama combined.

1191
01:52:59.82 --> 01:53:05.34
And enough raw materials in the shape of fuels, metals and other chemicals to keep several

1192
01:53:05.34 --> 01:53:12.38
major industries supplied for years. In fact apart from a little slum clearance, this abundance

1193
01:53:12.38 --> 01:53:19.18
of energy was wasted, consumed in the making of 26 million craters. And laying waste of 20,000

1194
01:53:19.18 --> 01:53:23.90
square kilometers of forests and the destruction of enough crops to feed 2 million people for a year.

1195
01:53:24.70 --> 01:53:27.82
However, while the reception of energy is still totally uncontrolled,

1196
01:53:27.82 --> 01:53:31.90
this is certainly not true of its direction in delivery. Indeed these have become a matter of

1197
01:53:31.90 --> 01:53:36.22
some sophistication and the prime concern of the military and naval commanders. There's the job

1198
01:53:36.22 --> 01:53:40.86
of deciding how, when and where to dispose of the energy which their side makes available,

1199
01:53:40.86 --> 01:53:45.10
they do this by occupying nodal points on a complex communication network.

1200
01:53:45.90 --> 01:53:49.98
In other words the ideal senior commander may be viewed as a device for receiving

1201
01:53:49.98 --> 01:53:54.46
processing and transmitting information in a way which will yield maximum gain for the minimum

1202
01:53:54.46 --> 01:54:00.54
costs. Whatever else he may be, he is part of a telephone exchange and part computer.

1203
01:54:02.06 --> 01:54:07.42
These the common denominators of general ship are depicted in figure one. And now he's got this

1204
01:54:07.42 --> 01:54:13.50
figure here. And this is a, we're going to go like a little bit of Uda activity. So Dave can get

1205
01:54:13.50 --> 01:54:17.82
all excited. He's got this first section which is input. This is what this is the input that you're

1206
01:54:17.82 --> 01:54:23.18
getting. You've got the program that you're on, the broad strategy, the directives from the

1207
01:54:23.18 --> 01:54:27.90
government, the orders from higher military authority, etc. You've got information about the

1208
01:54:27.90 --> 01:54:33.18
enemy, about your own troops, this includes strength, disposition, morale, intentions, supplies,

1209
01:54:33.18 --> 01:54:37.82
capabilities. You've got miscellaneous information, weather forecast, time, a year, moon,

1210
01:54:37.82 --> 01:54:41.18
tides, limitations, and staff communication. Now, so you've got all these things that are, you've got

1211
01:54:41.18 --> 01:54:48.86
your input. Now the input that you get as a leader gets pre-processed by the staff.

1212
01:54:48.86 --> 01:54:56.62
The, what the staff is doing is they're receiving it, they're putting it through a decision

1213
01:54:56.62 --> 01:55:01.74
process, they're running it through a program of their own previous experience. They got their

1214
01:55:01.74 --> 01:55:10.54
memories, how good is their memory? And then you get this output which eventually brings you

1215
01:55:10.54 --> 01:55:14.62
results. And by the way, that's a loop the whole time. So you got, that's the decision thing that's

1216
01:55:14.62 --> 01:55:19.26
happening. You've got information, you're processing it, you're bouncing it off your experiences,

1217
01:55:19.26 --> 01:55:28.06
you're bouncing it off your, your staff. You run that loop until you figure out what you should do,

1218
01:55:28.06 --> 01:55:31.90
which is pretty straight, which is seems complicated and you, you know how it tells me,

1219
01:55:31.90 --> 01:55:36.30
hard, it's going to be hard to make a really like a solid decision. And then you got this other

1220
01:55:36.30 --> 01:55:45.74
section here, which is called noise. And this is what, this is what screws you up. External,

1221
01:55:45.74 --> 01:55:55.02
enemy action inadequate intelligent sources, deluded chief of staff, etc, etc. Internal,

1222
01:55:56.70 --> 01:56:00.30
defective senses or memory. So those are, like you got all kind, we could list a million

1223
01:56:00.30 --> 01:56:04.86
things that are external, that are distractions and noise. Internal, you got defective senses,

1224
01:56:04.86 --> 01:56:10.94
emotion, rigidity, stretch, stress, dissonance, alcoholism, neurosis. So those are all kinds of

1225
01:56:10.94 --> 01:56:19.42
things, freaking, you're disaster. You're disaster is what you are. So he says, so, so I just kind of

1226
01:56:19.42 --> 01:56:23.66
like described what this diagram looks like. For those who don't relish and flow diagrams, let

1227
01:56:23.66 --> 01:56:27.82
it suffice to say that on the basis of a vast conglomerate of facts to do with the enemy, his own

1228
01:56:27.82 --> 01:56:32.30
side geography, weather, etc. Coupled with his own long-term store of past experience and specialist

1229
01:56:32.30 --> 01:56:37.26
knowledge, the senior commander makes decisions that ideally accord with the directives with which he

1230
01:56:37.26 --> 01:56:44.06
has been programmed ideally. But these ideals are hard to meet. For there are two main reasons.

1231
01:56:44.06 --> 01:56:50.86
The first is the senior commanders often have often to fill a number of incompatible roles.

1232
01:56:50.86 --> 01:56:56.78
According to Morris Janowitz, these include, include a heroic leader, military manager and techno

1233
01:56:56.78 --> 01:57:00.22
crap. So that's what you got to do if you're a leader in the military, heroic leader,

1234
01:57:00.22 --> 01:57:04.54
military manager and techno crap. To these we would add politician, public relations man,

1235
01:57:04.54 --> 01:57:09.66
and father figure in psychotherapists because that's what you're doing. The second reason for

1236
01:57:09.66 --> 01:57:15.02
breakdown is what communication engineers call noise in the system. Noise is what interferes with

1237
01:57:15.02 --> 01:57:19.34
the smooth flow of information. It's destructive power hinges on the fact that senior commanders

1238
01:57:19.34 --> 01:57:25.98
like any other device for processing information are channels of limited capacity. If they want

1239
01:57:25.98 --> 01:57:31.42
to deal with more information, they will tend to take longer about it. If they don't take longer,

1240
01:57:31.42 --> 01:57:36.62
they will make mistakes. Here we are using the term information in a special and perhaps

1241
01:57:36.62 --> 01:57:44.70
it's most important, since as the that which reduces uncertainty. So that's what information is.

1242
01:57:44.70 --> 01:57:53.98
Information is that which reduces uncertainty. Let me expand on this a little. A acquiring knowledge

1243
01:57:53.98 --> 01:57:59.26
involves the reduction of ignorance through the acquisition of facts, but ignorance is rarely

1244
01:57:59.26 --> 01:58:04.30
absolute and its reduction rarely total. Doesn't matter. You're not going to know everything.

1245
01:58:06.06 --> 01:58:12.06
And you're not going to know nothing. Hence reducing ignorance can be regarded as reducing

1246
01:58:12.06 --> 01:58:16.54
uncertainty about a given state of affairs. It follows that an unlikely or unexpected fact contains

1247
01:58:16.54 --> 01:58:22.22
more information. IE reduces more uncertainty than one which is already expected. He's going to go

1248
01:58:22.22 --> 01:58:29.02
into that hard. That what I just said it follows that an unlikely or unexpected fact contains more

1249
01:58:29.02 --> 01:58:35.98
information. IE reduces more uncertainty than one which is already expected. We are expected.

1250
01:58:35.98 --> 01:58:42.06
It well doesn't really help me that much. But an unexpected fact is less readily absorbed than one

1251
01:58:42.06 --> 01:58:47.58
which was expected. Ooh. Well, I wasn't expecting this to happen. So I'm going to kind of reject it.

1252
01:58:47.58 --> 01:58:54.22
If this is less than crystal clear, consider the following example, cast an assudable,

1253
01:58:54.22 --> 01:59:00.78
suitable military context. The message in this case consists of an intelligence report which states

1254
01:59:00.78 --> 01:59:07.66
quote, enemy preparing for counter-intact attack and quote. It goes onto detail strength,

1255
01:59:07.66 --> 01:59:13.34
disposition date and likely sector for attack. Now this message factually so simple contains

1256
01:59:13.34 --> 01:59:19.58
amount of information which differ greatly from commander to commander. To general A,

1257
01:59:20.78 --> 01:59:26.62
who anticipated such a counter-attack, it conveys very little. It merely confirms a hypothesis

1258
01:59:26.62 --> 01:59:31.98
which he already held. In fact, since he had already made extensive preparation for a counter-attack,

1259
01:59:31.98 --> 01:59:36.62
the intelligence report when it came was largely redundant. So that's general A. Hey,

1260
01:59:36.62 --> 01:59:43.02
I was expecting this quote. Got it. In the case of general B, however, the same message was quite

1261
01:59:43.02 --> 01:59:48.70
unexpected. So little had he anticipated an enemy counter-attack that the news was charged with

1262
01:59:48.70 --> 01:59:56.22
information. It reduced a great deal of ignorance and uncertainty. It gave him plenty to occupy his mind

1263
01:59:56.22 --> 02:00:02.62
and much to do. And I'm going to dive into that part right there because this is really important.

1264
02:00:03.74 --> 02:00:09.82
Finally, we have general C for whom the message was so totally unexpected that he chose to ignore

1265
02:00:09.82 --> 02:00:15.82
it with disastrous results. It conflicted with his preconceptions. It clashed with his wishes.

1266
02:00:15.82 --> 02:00:22.86
It emanated so he fought from an unreliable source. Since his mind was closed to its reception,

1267
02:00:22.86 --> 02:00:28.30
he found plenty of reasons for refusing to believe it, like British generals after the Battle

1268
02:00:28.30 --> 02:00:35.18
of Cambrae or American generals before the German counter-affective in the Ardenes of 1944.

1269
02:00:35.18 --> 02:00:43.10
He ignored it at his cost. Its information content was just too high for his channel of limited

1270
02:00:43.10 --> 02:00:53.82
capacity. And so those three examples. And when I first read this, I thought,

1271
02:00:53.82 --> 02:00:57.18
generally, it doesn't contain much information because he was already expecting it.

1272
02:00:57.18 --> 02:01:01.34
General B got a lot of information from it because he wasn't expecting it. And it seems like

1273
02:01:01.34 --> 02:01:06.06
General B might be in a better situation because he got more information, but that's not true.

1274
02:01:06.06 --> 02:01:11.02
And it all boils down to this last thing. Its information content was too high for his limited

1275
02:01:11.02 --> 02:01:21.74
channel of capacity of his limited capacity. I think an advantage that I have,

1276
02:01:22.54 --> 02:01:29.90
and that I try and teach other people, is to have an open mind and to not

1277
02:01:29.90 --> 02:01:36.54
renew information arises to absorb it and accept it and be like, okay, this is new information.

1278
02:01:36.54 --> 02:01:43.42
I take it with a grain of salt, of course, but I'm not, and go even further than that.

1279
02:01:43.42 --> 02:01:49.02
It's not just that my mind is open. It's that I'm actually trying to anticipate what's going on.

1280
02:01:49.90 --> 02:01:53.50
I'm actually thinking, well, what are they probably going to do? They're probably going to do this.

1281
02:01:53.50 --> 02:01:58.14
And but I don't dig in on that. You know, the enemy can probably get a attack from the west.

1282
02:01:58.14 --> 02:02:01.18
But I'm going to go know the enemy's going to attack. The enemy's going to probably

1283
02:02:01.18 --> 02:02:03.98
get attacked from the west, but they could also come from the south. And you know what they could

1284
02:02:03.98 --> 02:02:05.66
come from these north. Doesn't matter.

1285
02:02:09.66 --> 02:02:15.02
I think that when you said the word anticipation was the piece, as I'm hearing you talk about a bit,

1286
02:02:15.02 --> 02:02:17.26
you hear the three generals and you think, oh, be the right guy.

1287
02:02:18.14 --> 02:02:23.82
Oh, no, you thought that's true. No, no, no, I know. I actually, I'm trying to explain the logic.

1288
02:02:23.82 --> 02:02:29.18
Right, right, right, it seems a face of value as an unfolded in my head. Yeah. Like, oh, I could see people

1289
02:02:29.18 --> 02:02:35.66
going, oh, bees the best example because he got the most information. Oh, man, this changes everything. Holy cow.

1290
02:02:35.66 --> 02:02:39.34
And clearly sees the worst because he's like, I can't accept that in my brain. So we're not doing that.

1291
02:02:39.34 --> 02:02:42.30
I don't acknowledge it. And to his following, like it's going to, the whole team's going to go

1292
02:02:42.30 --> 02:02:48.06
wiped out. But when you said anticipation, because I think of it as you, as we talk about it, as we teach it.

1293
02:02:48.06 --> 02:02:52.14
And as, as you've discussed it, which is I'm going to do these things. I'm going to make these moves. I'm going to,

1294
02:02:52.14 --> 02:02:59.82
I'm going to try to create a situation that unfold a certain way. But I know, I know it doesn't

1295
02:02:59.82 --> 02:03:05.18
go the way that I expect, which is I am anticipating a bunch of other potential officers. Now,

1296
02:03:05.18 --> 02:03:09.42
I don't necessarily know which one it's going to be. But when you come back and say, it didn't go,

1297
02:03:10.46 --> 02:03:15.50
let me say differently. It went this way. And no matter what this way is, you go, okay, I can see that.

1298
02:03:15.50 --> 02:03:20.70
I can see how our moves created this outcome. And maybe not even what you want. Or maybe not even

1299
02:03:20.70 --> 02:03:27.90
what you expected. But the other ones aren't unexpected, which makes it so much easier to go, okay,

1300
02:03:27.90 --> 02:03:32.06
cool. Now I've got an information. Here's the adjustments we're going to make. Or hey, we'll continue

1301
02:03:32.06 --> 02:03:35.82
down the path of it so we want it. But the anticipation that the outcome is not what you want.

1302
02:03:37.42 --> 02:03:41.74
That word, that's the piece for me that resonates, which is the best situation to be in as,

1303
02:03:41.74 --> 02:03:45.98
oh, it was different than I wanted, even a little different than I expected. And I'm not surprised

1304
02:03:45.98 --> 02:03:52.78
by that. I don't get caught mentally off balance very often because you don't pre-determined the

1305
02:03:52.78 --> 02:03:58.94
outcome. Because I don't lean too hard now. I'm not saying I don't lean. But I don't lean so much

1306
02:03:58.94 --> 02:04:05.82
that when that resistance is there, I just fall in my face. Yeah. And I, I, I, I steal a

1307
02:04:05.82 --> 02:04:09.82
comment that you made with from from your second platoon commander over and over again. The

1308
02:04:09.82 --> 02:04:14.38
contact he was using, it was someone on his, on your team doing something wasn't really smart.

1309
02:04:14.38 --> 02:04:19.42
And it's just the simple saying of, you got to expect these things to happen. But I overlay that

1310
02:04:19.42 --> 02:04:24.30
onto everything I can think of, which is, oh, that didn't really go as expected. But I'm not that

1311
02:04:24.30 --> 02:04:28.70
surprised by it. Like, yeah, I kind of expect these things to happen. And just the idea of saying,

1312
02:04:29.58 --> 02:04:33.66
you got to expect those things to happen. Other people thinking, holy cow, this is a level

1313
02:04:33.66 --> 02:04:39.26
10 emergency. This is an unsolvable tragedy. He's like, no, I kind of am used to these type of things

1314
02:04:39.26 --> 02:04:43.34
going the way that people don't expect it. And we can actually solve this. I can absorb it and

1315
02:04:43.34 --> 02:04:49.66
make some changes. No factor. Yeah. Yeah. Don't over commit to your brain. Over can

1316
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:56.70
admit the outcome. The, the other thing about this example is with this mechanical like dissection,

1317
02:04:56.70 --> 02:05:03.42
he's doing of all this stuff. There's he talks a lot about the capacity. And with general A,

1318
02:05:04.22 --> 02:05:10.62
you've got very little capacity left over from what you were expecting, right? So you've got

1319
02:05:10.62 --> 02:05:16.38
your expectation of what's going to happen. And you've got some capacity left over to to

1320
02:05:16.38 --> 02:05:24.94
dedicate to what's actually happening. Guy B, or the general B, let's say, he, it takes him

1321
02:05:24.94 --> 02:05:31.18
by surprise. So now he has to do so much more back in work that general A's already done. And he's

1322
02:05:31.18 --> 02:05:36.54
got all this free capacity. But now he can dedicate to what's actually happening. And the third

1323
02:05:36.54 --> 02:05:45.26
guy has got so little, you know, that he just, he chooses to willfully ignore what's happening

1324
02:05:45.26 --> 02:05:51.10
rather than take on the challenge of, you know. Yeah. If you did one of those games where you have

1325
02:05:51.10 --> 02:05:55.42
to look at something for a short period of time and remember as much as you can. If I said,

1326
02:05:55.42 --> 02:06:01.34
okay, Dave, I'm going to show you a car in this next picture. It's a Ford Bronco. And I want you

1327
02:06:01.34 --> 02:06:04.94
to remember as much about as it could. You'd be like, okay, here's the color. Here's the

1328
02:06:04.94 --> 02:06:08.38
last one. But if I said, hey, Kerry, I want you to go and I'm going to show you a picture.

1329
02:06:09.18 --> 02:06:14.38
Tell me as much about it as you can. You'd be like, get half, a quarter of the information because

1330
02:06:14.38 --> 02:06:20.14
you just don't have that much capacity. Your capacities already taken. It's overflowing, right,

1331
02:06:20.14 --> 02:06:24.30
with stuff. Try to make sure. So the color, right, like you're trying to figure all this out.

1332
02:06:24.30 --> 02:06:27.90
And you're just overwhelmed. So that's what we're trying not to do, right?

1333
02:06:28.86 --> 02:06:32.38
And I think also, too, just from a leadership standpoint, you're thinking about people. There

1334
02:06:32.38 --> 02:06:36.54
aren't three versions of people out there. There's seven billion versions of that. So this is a,

1335
02:06:37.34 --> 02:06:42.62
this is a dial across all those spectrums. And certainly you can categorize that. And those examples

1336
02:06:42.62 --> 02:06:47.50
are good examples. But even inside there, you don't just get three. If you got a team of 26,

1337
02:06:47.50 --> 02:06:51.42
you're not, don't bend them into three categories and presume they sit in those, those bins.

1338
02:06:51.42 --> 02:06:57.90
I bet you that you could probably break it down into weight classes, though. And not end up with

1339
02:06:57.90 --> 02:07:03.10
seven billion but end up with like nine laying classes. You know? And it's really just, there's a

1340
02:07:03.10 --> 02:07:09.18
spectrum inside there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're between, you know, 170 pounds and 180 five pounds.

1341
02:07:09.18 --> 02:07:14.70
Like we know what kind of, we know you're, you're like lean and really hard. We know where you're

1342
02:07:14.70 --> 02:07:22.70
going to know. Yeah. This continues. One particularly hazardous aspect of the relationship between

1343
02:07:22.70 --> 02:07:31.02
information and decision processes concerns the revising of decisions. It seems that having

1344
02:07:31.02 --> 02:07:37.50
gradually and perhaps painfully accumulated information in support of a decision, people become

1345
02:07:37.50 --> 02:07:45.10
progressively more low to accept contrary evidence. So this is everything we're just talking about.

1346
02:07:45.10 --> 02:07:50.54
You make a decision. You've got some information. And now we're not want to accept anything different

1347
02:07:50.54 --> 02:07:55.34
as Edd's words and his colleagues have shown the greater the impact of new information,

1348
02:07:55.34 --> 02:08:00.62
the more strenuously it will be resisted, which is actually crazy. It's actually crazy.

1349
02:08:00.62 --> 02:08:05.10
Dave's like, I'm head north. I'm head north. We're head north right now. We made the call. And I'm

1350
02:08:05.10 --> 02:08:09.26
like, hey, actually brothers, like, enemy up there. And you're like, we already made the call. Like,

1351
02:08:10.06 --> 02:08:16.22
are you sure total resistance? There are several reasons for this dangerous conservatism.

1352
02:08:16.22 --> 02:08:22.06
New information has by definition high informational content. And therefore, firstly, it will require

1353
02:08:22.06 --> 02:08:27.58
greater processing capacity. Secondly, it threatens a return to an earlier state of knowing

1354
02:08:27.58 --> 02:08:32.62
uncertainty. And thirdly, it confronts the decision maker with the nasty thought that he may have

1355
02:08:32.62 --> 02:08:40.86
been wrong. No wonder he tends to turn a blind eye. I mean, I talk about this in one way or another

1356
02:08:40.86 --> 02:08:47.58
all the time. All the time. Isn't it scary to think I'd rather just be wrong than go back to just

1357
02:08:47.58 --> 02:08:53.66
being uncertain? Look, we're going north. Brother, there's enemy up there. Yeah, but at least I know

1358
02:08:53.66 --> 02:08:56.86
where I'm going.

1359
02:08:56.86 --> 02:08:58.86
Rick and disaster.com.

1360
02:09:01.26 --> 02:09:07.02
So much for a broad description of this most vital dimension of knowledge. It's prior improbability.

1361
02:09:07.02 --> 02:09:12.70
Let us return now to the other side of the coin, the problem of noise. Noise, as we saw,

1362
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:17.50
is the enemy of information. Noise takes up channel space and thereby disrupts the flow of

1363
02:09:17.50 --> 02:09:22.22
information. The more limited the channel capacity, the greater disrupting effects of noise.

1364
02:09:23.02 --> 02:09:30.38
The more noise, the less information can be handled. And, and, um, again, as I read this,

1365
02:09:30.38 --> 02:09:33.82
I look for some of the things that I do wrong, some of the things I do good. Man, I am an

1366
02:09:33.82 --> 02:09:40.70
noise eliminator. I may freak in noise eliminator. There's stuff going on around me that doesn't matter.

1367
02:09:40.70 --> 02:09:47.66
I, like, give it no snow. I don't give it a second of my energy. Just to be able to recognize

1368
02:09:47.66 --> 02:09:54.86
what is noise. And go, hey, that's noise. We're going to filter that out as opposed to the overreaction

1369
02:09:54.86 --> 02:10:00.70
the most people have. And, and I keep in my own head going back to things that I recall. As you're

1370
02:10:00.70 --> 02:10:05.82
reading this, I've been thinking a lot about Band of Brothers. And there's a character in there.

1371
02:10:05.82 --> 02:10:13.50
If you haven't heard it, the book is awesome. The, the, the TV series is like incredibly good. It's

1372
02:10:13.50 --> 02:10:17.50
very rare that I take a book and we'll see the, the TV version. I'm going to go, I was really,

1373
02:10:17.50 --> 02:10:21.58
really good. The TV version is awesome. There's this character, Captain Sobel, who is kind of like

1374
02:10:21.58 --> 02:10:25.74
this tyrant of a leader. And there's a scene where he's leading this platoon and he runs into, like,

1375
02:10:25.74 --> 02:10:29.98
I think it's like he's maneuvering to get to some objective and, and he ends up up against, like, a

1376
02:10:29.98 --> 02:10:34.86
barbed wire face. This fence isn't supposed to end here. It's not on the map and it's guys like,

1377
02:10:34.86 --> 02:10:39.58
Sir, we can, we could just go, we could just cut the fence. And he's like, yeah, but it's not supposed

1378
02:10:39.58 --> 02:10:44.06
to be any spends all this time reacting to the idea that this fence was not on the map and the people

1379
02:10:44.06 --> 02:10:48.78
are on like, sir, but it's like a barbed wire fence. We could get through this thing in literally

1380
02:10:48.78 --> 02:10:55.42
five seconds. But that noise of the fence that's, it's not supposed to be here. And he was

1381
02:10:55.42 --> 02:11:00.78
incapable of responding to what appeared to be this, and it's the inability to go, oh, oh,

1382
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:04.62
hey, this is a distractor. Hey, this is noise. We need to filter this out. I would say that's actually

1383
02:11:04.62 --> 02:11:09.18
a better example of this isn't what I expected and therefore I can't accept it. Well, card of

1384
02:11:09.18 --> 02:11:12.78
that, yes, it's beyond noise because noise is like, well, there's other stuff going on, but here's

1385
02:11:12.78 --> 02:11:18.94
the, he's seeing something with his own two eyes. And he's like, hey, this isn't supposed to be,

1386
02:11:18.94 --> 02:11:23.10
the map doesn't have this. Well, it's funny you said that because I've been thinking about him for about

1387
02:11:23.10 --> 02:11:28.14
30 minutes and I chose this as the example, but where it really indexed for me was when you gave

1388
02:11:28.14 --> 02:11:32.46
to those three examples, you know, I don't like dude, that's Captain Solbowl man. This is in the

1389
02:11:32.46 --> 02:11:36.46
character that he talks about in this book to reveal what this character was like and it brought

1390
02:11:36.46 --> 02:11:41.26
me back to authoritarian. You know, he do uniform inspections if you had one thing off

1391
02:11:41.26 --> 02:11:46.62
you lose a weekend. He was just such a follow the, to the, to the detriment of every himself and

1392
02:11:46.62 --> 02:11:51.34
everybody around him, but you know what the military loves, a uniform platoon, they all look the same.

1393
02:11:51.34 --> 02:11:57.50
It's just a character, but it's, it's that idea that the incapacity to, to acknowledge those things

1394
02:11:57.50 --> 02:12:01.58
and be able to deal with him and happening real time and go, hey, this is no factor. And there's, oh,

1395
02:12:01.58 --> 02:12:06.78
okay, cool. It's just a character, but it's also a complete and utter caricature of this authoritarian

1396
02:12:06.78 --> 02:12:10.86
lead. We can probably just start referring back to him throughout the rest of this book. It's so

1397
02:12:10.86 --> 02:12:19.34
very strong. Um, a glance back at figure one suggests that not only does a senior military commander

1398
02:12:19.34 --> 02:12:24.46
receive more than more than his fair share of information, but the communication system of which he

1399
02:12:24.46 --> 02:12:32.78
forms a part is a peculiar, particularly susceptible to noise. This may be external and origin

1400
02:12:32.78 --> 02:12:40.22
ranging from the static on a radio link to the delusions of a chief of staff. Or it may be internal

1401
02:12:40.22 --> 02:12:45.58
ranging from such peripheral sources as poor eyesight, a common feature of the generals of the

1402
02:12:45.58 --> 02:12:53.18
Crimean War to such centrally central and usually more disastrous causes as defective memory

1403
02:12:53.18 --> 02:13:03.10
brain disease, neurosis and alcoholism. Noise from all these sources may act upon the flow of

1404
02:13:03.10 --> 02:13:09.98
information through a general's head and eventuate indecisions varying in gravity from the mildly

1405
02:13:09.98 --> 02:13:15.50
inept to the utterly catastrophic, but decisions hinge upon more than available information. They also

1406
02:13:15.50 --> 02:13:21.02
depend upon quote payoffs. The anticipated consequences of choosing one course of action rather than

1407
02:13:21.02 --> 02:13:28.30
another. Payoffs may be positive or negative beneficial or costly. They are the criteria according

1408
02:13:28.30 --> 02:13:35.10
to which decisions are made. Obviously, if a commander gets his criteria wrong, if the possible loss

1409
02:13:35.10 --> 02:13:42.06
of self-esteem or social approval or fear of offending a superior authority is given greater

1410
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:50.78
waiting than more rational considerations the scene is set for calamity. So there you are trying

1411
02:13:50.78 --> 02:13:56.30
to make a decision and you're weighing if you're going to lose self-esteem or if you're going

1412
02:13:56.30 --> 02:14:04.14
to lose social approval which is crazy. But we know that happens. The possibility of this happening

1413
02:14:04.14 --> 02:14:08.94
is increased by the fact that the fog of war, unlike uncertainties which attach to most civilian

1414
02:14:08.94 --> 02:14:13.98
enterprises, extends not only to the input, but also to the payoffs. Not only does the general

1415
02:14:13.98 --> 02:14:18.14
have to make decisions on the basis of a great volume of dubious information and a meet.

1416
02:14:18.86 --> 02:14:25.02
And me to program of perhaps questionable validity, he may also not know the cost and benefits

1417
02:14:25.02 --> 02:14:30.38
of what he does propose. He is like a man who places a bet without knowing the odds or where

1418
02:14:30.38 --> 02:14:34.06
the book he might be found once the race is over. This is a freaking hard job.

1419
02:14:35.98 --> 02:14:41.66
As well as those problems which are inherent in any communication system, the human decision maker

1420
02:14:41.66 --> 02:14:48.78
is the victim of another hazard. Namely, that attention, perception, memory and thinking are all

1421
02:14:48.78 --> 02:14:55.90
liable to distortion or bias by emotion and motivation. As needs arise, whether they be social or

1422
02:14:55.90 --> 02:15:02.86
biological neurotic or adaptive, so they act upon a way man perceives his external world what he

1423
02:15:02.86 --> 02:15:08.30
attends to, the sort of memories which he conjures up and the decisions which he makes.

1424
02:15:09.50 --> 02:15:14.86
He is like a computer which has not only to receive store, process and deliver information,

1425
02:15:14.86 --> 02:15:19.66
but also has to postpone sleep, cope with hunger, resist fear, control anger,

1426
02:15:19.66 --> 02:15:26.70
sublimate sex and keep up with the Joneses. When it is considered that the capacity for perception

1427
02:15:26.70 --> 02:15:31.74
and response for memory and thought presumably evolved for the satisfaction of needs,

1428
02:15:31.74 --> 02:15:36.78
it is a remarkable achievement at the best of times to keep these informational processes of

1429
02:15:36.78 --> 02:15:41.42
mind free from bias by the needs which they were originally designed to serve.

1430
02:15:41.90 --> 02:15:47.82
So you got all this stuff going on in your head. You're genetically built this way to have these thoughts

1431
02:15:47.82 --> 02:15:54.70
and have these poles and have these biases and it's hard as hell to keep that stuff

1432
02:15:54.70 --> 02:15:58.86
and make your operating system as clean as possible. And then he says, in war, such an achievement

1433
02:15:58.86 --> 02:16:04.70
borders on the miraculous and this for very one simple reason, the effects or needs, the effects

1434
02:16:04.70 --> 02:16:11.10
of needs upon cognition are maximized when the needs are very strong and external reality is

1435
02:16:11.10 --> 02:16:16.94
ambiguous or confused. It is under such conditions that need and emotion have the greatest

1436
02:16:16.94 --> 02:16:22.38
freedom of maneuver, the greatest capacity for imposing themselves upon the uncertainties of thought.

1437
02:16:22.38 --> 02:16:28.38
These are the conditions which obtain in war and that is freaking important.

1438
02:16:29.74 --> 02:16:35.82
This whole idea that emotion has the greatest freedom of maneuver

1439
02:16:37.50 --> 02:16:43.50
and the greatest capacity for imposing itself on you during times of uncertainty. And this is why

1440
02:16:43.50 --> 02:16:47.98
this is why people get crazy. This is why people get crazy when you go on deployment in a

1441
02:16:47.98 --> 02:16:52.70
combat zone. This is why somebody that's acting normal and seems to be good to go and all of a

1442
02:16:52.70 --> 02:16:58.62
sudden you get on deployment and they get crazy because that emotion starts to come out.

1443
02:17:01.34 --> 02:17:06.78
I remember I wrote a note to my buddy, a good friend of mine, just to recount this idea.

1444
02:17:07.50 --> 02:17:12.14
When I was lucky enough that I was one of the first units to deploy after 9-11 to go to

1445
02:17:12.14 --> 02:17:16.22
Afghanistan and start dropping bombs out there which was at the time like the best thing ever was

1446
02:17:16.22 --> 02:17:20.54
what I wanted to be doing. Oh, not 11 happened and everybody was sort of scrambling to go and

1447
02:17:20.54 --> 02:17:25.26
came back and then Iraq was we knew that Iraq was going to happen relatively shortly after we

1448
02:17:25.26 --> 02:17:28.14
came back within the year. And I remember writing a note to a buddy of mine who was getting ready to

1449
02:17:28.14 --> 02:17:33.42
go to his first combat deployment. And I just said that people around you were going to do crazy things.

1450
02:17:33.42 --> 02:17:37.34
People that you think you know are going to do things that totally catch you, of course. I was like

1451
02:17:37.34 --> 02:17:42.94
my first lesson from just and that's a very small degree compared to what he experienced World War II

1452
02:17:42.94 --> 02:17:47.66
and the biggest takeaway that he was asking, hey, what can I expect? It had nothing to do with

1453
02:17:48.38 --> 02:17:53.50
the tactics. I said the people around you are going to do things that catch you off guard.

1454
02:17:53.50 --> 02:17:58.30
They're going to surprise you because the situation is going to their circuit breaker is going

1455
02:17:58.30 --> 02:18:04.70
to pop and it's going to blow their minds. Yeah, and that's a warning I've given people as well

1456
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:10.46
of your, you get right on the planet. I remember explaining you someone, hey, it's going to get wild.

1457
02:18:10.46 --> 02:18:16.22
And meaning people can start acting crazy and you know having people say no they're not like, okay.

1458
02:18:17.98 --> 02:18:22.14
You know fast forward two months. It's like, bro, what's happening with this dude? I'm like,

1459
02:18:22.14 --> 02:18:25.34
remember what I told you people were going to get crazy. There you go.

1460
02:18:25.34 --> 02:18:34.78
Contemplation of what is involved in general ship may well, may well occasion surprise that

1461
02:18:34.78 --> 02:18:41.18
incompetence is not absolutely inevitable that anyone can do the job at all. Particularly

1462
02:18:41.82 --> 02:18:47.18
is this so when one considers that military decisions are often made under conditions of a

1463
02:18:47.18 --> 02:18:55.02
enormous stress when actual noise fatigue lack of sleep poor food and grinding responsibility

1464
02:18:55.02 --> 02:18:59.58
add their quotas to the ever present threat of total annihilation. He's like, hey, bro, it's a

1465
02:18:59.58 --> 02:19:05.90
miracle and anyone can pull this shit off. I love this end. Actual noise. Actual noise and that's

1466
02:19:05.90 --> 02:19:12.30
an italics. Totally man. I hope I said it in italics because it's in italics. Indeed, the four going

1467
02:19:12.30 --> 02:19:17.02
analysis of general ship prompts the thought that it might be better to scrap generals and leave

1468
02:19:17.02 --> 02:19:22.94
decision-making aspects of war to computers. A similar argument has been made as been

1469
02:19:22.94 --> 02:19:27.90
advancing connection with medicine. Why leave diagnosis and therapeutic decisions to

1470
02:19:27.90 --> 02:19:33.34
fallable human brains when a computer could make them with far less chance of error. The

1471
02:19:33.34 --> 02:19:38.70
answer, of course, and this no doubt contributes much to the relief of generals and doctors that

1472
02:19:38.70 --> 02:19:45.26
computers make poor leaders and indifferent father figures. They may be quick and efficient,

1473
02:19:45.26 --> 02:19:51.02
unpredgidous, sober and alert, but with all remain cold fish. They do not inspire

1474
02:19:51.02 --> 02:19:57.02
affection with its consequent desire to please nor do they exude a bedside manner. Paradoxically,

1475
02:19:57.02 --> 02:20:03.74
they are also perhaps just a little too infallible. They are more over as we as far as we know

1476
02:20:03.74 --> 02:20:10.46
avoid a feelings what is worse quite indifferent to outcomes of their decisions. But while all

1477
02:20:10.46 --> 02:20:15.98
this militates against computers as leaders of men, so called leadership qualities and

1478
02:20:15.98 --> 02:20:21.34
military commanders are just as dependent upon the various factors outlined in our flow chart

1479
02:20:21.34 --> 02:20:32.46
as are any of the other responses which a general mix. Pregnits, fear of failure, over conformity

1480
02:20:32.46 --> 02:20:38.46
and sheer stupidity may disrupt leadership decisions as surely as they interfere with planning

1481
02:20:38.46 --> 02:20:45.10
or technical decisions. All are products of the same brain. Man, there's a lot going on.

1482
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:55.74
One last point, a senior military or naval commander does not invite cannot act in lonely isolation

1483
02:20:55.74 --> 02:21:02.14
but is fettered by the organization to which he belongs. He is like a computer or telephone exchange

1484
02:21:02.14 --> 02:21:08.62
whose motive operandi is based on rules which may have little relevance to the tasks it is called

1485
02:21:08.62 --> 02:21:15.50
upon to perform. Imagine a telephone exchange that for the honor of the post office has to follow the

1486
02:21:15.50 --> 02:21:23.18
rule that all telephonists should have red hair, 38 inch busts and heavily-litted eyes and one as

1487
02:21:23.18 --> 02:21:28.30
some idea of the restricting effects which an organization may have upon its own functioning.

1488
02:21:28.30 --> 02:21:34.14
In these chapters that follow we shall be examining some well-known cases of military incompetence

1489
02:21:34.14 --> 02:21:40.30
to discover if possible the precise reasons for and the common denominators of these events.

1490
02:21:40.30 --> 02:21:46.38
For the moment, however, let us consider one brief and less well-known incident which illustrates

1491
02:21:46.38 --> 02:21:52.38
how the smooth flow of information through the brains of senior commanders may be so distorted

1492
02:21:52.38 --> 02:21:59.82
that their decisions prove catastrophic. The culprits in this instance are naval, not military commanders.

1493
02:22:00.70 --> 02:22:07.18
The place is Samoa in the date 1889, seven warships, three American,

1494
02:22:07.18 --> 02:22:12.54
three German and one British are lying at acre in the harbor of apia.

1495
02:22:13.90 --> 02:22:19.10
They are there as naval and military presence to watch over the interests of their various

1496
02:22:19.10 --> 02:22:25.18
governments in the political upheavals that are taking place ashore. Accordingly, they anchor

1497
02:22:25.18 --> 02:22:29.98
in what has been described as one of the most dangerous anchorages in the world.

1498
02:22:30.62 --> 02:22:39.18
For to call apia a harbor at all is at best an unfortunate euphemism. Largely occupied by coral reefs,

1499
02:22:39.18 --> 02:22:44.62
this saucer-shaped indentation lies wide open to the north, when the great

1500
02:22:44.62 --> 02:22:51.90
Pacific rollers come sweeping in. In fair weather apia provides an uneasy resting place for no more

1501
02:22:51.90 --> 02:22:57.90
than four medium-sized ships. For seven large ships and numerous smaller craft

1502
02:22:59.34 --> 02:23:05.98
under adverse conditions, it is a death trap. This was the situation in which the seven

1503
02:23:05.98 --> 02:23:12.14
men of war witnessed the first bleak portents of an approaching typhoon. They're got seven

1504
02:23:12.14 --> 02:23:16.78
ships inside this little harbor which this little harbor actually has an open mouth to the sea.

1505
02:23:17.90 --> 02:23:23.58
Full of reefs, full of reefs, full of reefs. It's big enough for four ships. They're seven in that.

1506
02:23:24.62 --> 02:23:32.14
Even to Eland's men, a rapidly darkening sky and falling glass, squally gusts of wind,

1507
02:23:32.14 --> 02:23:40.62
and then a law would bow to ill. For seven naval captains, the signs were unmistakable. They knew

1508
02:23:40.62 --> 02:23:46.70
they were in a region of the world, particularly subject typhoons, which in a matter of minutes could

1509
02:23:46.70 --> 02:23:51.98
lash the sea into a furious hell of boiling water. They knew that such storms generate winds

1510
02:23:51.98 --> 02:23:57.66
traveling at upwards of a hundred knots, gusts that could snap masks like carrots, reduced deck

1511
02:23:57.66 --> 02:24:04.94
fittings to match wood, and throw ships on their beams. They knew that this was the worst month of

1512
02:24:04.94 --> 02:24:12.38
the year, and they also knew that only three years before every ship in apia had been sunk by such a storm.

1513
02:24:13.66 --> 02:24:19.50
In short, and in terms of our flowchart, their stored information

1514
02:24:19.50 --> 02:24:24.54
coupled with present input pointed to only one decision to get up and get out.

1515
02:24:25.90 --> 02:24:31.90
And as if this was not enough, the urgency weighing of weighing anchor and putting to sea was

1516
02:24:31.90 --> 02:24:37.74
respectively suggested by subordinate officers. So you got a freaking massive storm approaching

1517
02:24:39.26 --> 02:24:43.26
by the way, what was it a year? Three years before every ship in the harbour had been sunk.

1518
02:24:44.38 --> 02:24:48.46
We got subordinate officers that are saying, hey captain, we should get out of here.

1519
02:24:51.90 --> 02:24:56.94
But the captains of the warship, but the captains of the warships were also naval officers,

1520
02:24:56.94 --> 02:25:03.66
and so they denied the undeniable and stayed where they were. Their behavior has been described

1521
02:25:03.66 --> 02:25:09.90
as an, quote, error of judgment that will forever remain a paradox in human psychology, and quote.

1522
02:25:10.70 --> 02:25:14.54
When the typhoon struck, its effects were tragic and inevitable.

1523
02:25:16.06 --> 02:25:20.30
Without sea-room, their anchors dragging under the pressure of the mountainous seas,

1524
02:25:20.30 --> 02:25:26.38
their holes in rigging crust by the fury of the wind, three of the warships collided before

1525
02:25:26.38 --> 02:25:31.66
being swept onto the jagged reefs of coral. Another sank in deep water. Two more were wrecked

1526
02:25:31.66 --> 02:25:36.70
upon the beach. Of all the ships in the harbour, the only survivor was a British Corvette,

1527
02:25:36.70 --> 02:25:42.22
which thanks to its powerful engines and superb seam and ship, squeaked through to the open sea.

1528
02:25:43.98 --> 02:25:49.82
Why did the naval commanders burst in the ways of the sea and provided with ample warning,

1529
02:25:49.82 --> 02:25:56.78
thus hazard their ships and their lives of their men? A superficial answer might be pride,

1530
02:25:57.58 --> 02:26:01.66
or fear of appearing cowardly, or fear of criticism from their superiors.

1531
02:26:03.02 --> 02:26:07.34
These matters are to be pursued in later chapters. For the moment, the apparently

1532
02:26:07.34 --> 02:26:14.06
incursible behavior of these men illustrates how decision-process can be thrown into disarray

1533
02:26:14.06 --> 02:26:22.14
by noise of internal origin and how, in this instance, any way, incompetence cannot be attributed

1534
02:26:22.14 --> 02:26:25.42
to ignorance or ordinary stupidity.

1535
02:26:31.98 --> 02:26:39.26
It's an inter, the focus of that is this is an internal noise, it's internal. They knew what

1536
02:26:39.26 --> 02:26:44.14
was coming, they could see what was coming, there's no lack of communication, they were watching

1537
02:26:44.14 --> 02:26:48.94
the storm come. They have the history, they have they know what's happened in this harbour

1538
02:26:48.94 --> 02:26:55.34
for this, and like everything is clear and yet the decision by seven captains. I guess

1539
02:26:55.34 --> 02:27:00.14
six, one of them made it out, sounds like he squeaked out though, they all make the wrong decision.

1540
02:27:01.74 --> 02:27:06.70
How does that happen? No external factors can be blamed in the situation.

1541
02:27:06.70 --> 02:27:17.18
It's internal, it's internal noise that comes from our own psychology.

1542
02:27:20.06 --> 02:27:26.30
So, well two and a half hours deep. I say we call it for today.

1543
02:27:26.30 --> 02:27:38.46
This book is going to be, there's so much in this book and I'll start to speed up a little bit

1544
02:27:38.46 --> 02:27:45.74
I think as we push into the next podcast, hit some of the high waves for the section where they

1545
02:27:45.74 --> 02:27:50.46
cover the historical disasters, but like I said, it's not like he just talks about the historical

1546
02:27:50.46 --> 02:27:55.18
disasters and explain what happens. He starts to explain why decisions are getting made,

1547
02:27:55.18 --> 02:28:03.90
where the ego comes into play, who's offending one another, what these internal decision disasters

1548
02:28:03.90 --> 02:28:13.50
are caused by, and I'm telling you, it is a great warning for all of us, military, civilian,

1549
02:28:13.50 --> 02:28:22.62
business, family, and you can probably already see the, this is what we talk about all the time.

1550
02:28:22.62 --> 02:28:26.94
This book, these these topics are what we talk about all the time and the examples,

1551
02:28:27.66 --> 02:28:36.94
bring them to, to even clearer light. We'll get into it on the next podcast.

1552
02:28:37.98 --> 02:28:44.30
Until then, Kerry, we are, we are trying to prevent our own

1553
02:28:46.06 --> 02:28:51.82
incompetence as much as possible in every aspect of our lives. We are. What, what, what can you

1554
02:28:51.82 --> 02:28:57.98
recommend us to try and mitigate our own incompetence? That's not a very high goal, is it?

1555
02:28:58.78 --> 02:29:05.66
mitigating our own incompetence. What do you got? So we want to battle in competence. We want to be

1556
02:29:05.66 --> 02:29:13.66
more capable, not less capable. We want a clean operating system. Oh, my, like where you're going

1557
02:29:13.66 --> 02:29:20.22
to this. A break clean, right? So how can we do that? We're going to do that with a little bit of

1558
02:29:20.22 --> 02:29:30.94
jacophil, a little discipline go, a little RTD, and again, possibly some afterburner orange or

1559
02:29:30.94 --> 02:29:38.46
mango mayhem from the big dog echo Charles. Who? The big dog echo Charles, the Hawaiian.

1560
02:29:38.46 --> 02:29:46.94
That name rings a bell. Oh, the guy who's job is a girl. Oh, yeah, I forgot his name. The big dog

1561
02:29:46.94 --> 02:29:51.98
echo Charles. Well, people look at a freak out. Oh, man. K dogs on here. They're like,

1562
02:29:51.98 --> 02:29:57.26
wait a second, what happened to echo Charles? Cover move. Okay, about that. So he could make it today.

1563
02:29:57.26 --> 02:30:03.50
Echo Charles was otherwise detained. Right on. So K dogs had to step up to the play. How did

1564
02:30:03.50 --> 02:30:08.94
feel in the hot seat over there? Can you been behind the scenes? I've been behind the scenes a little

1565
02:30:08.94 --> 02:30:13.90
bit. I've been in the background. You've been on the side of the camera. Yeah, yeah. Now you're front

1566
02:30:13.90 --> 02:30:22.94
and center. Now we're in here. Maybe Echo is like, he's on the ropes. Echo is an institution as far

1567
02:30:22.94 --> 02:30:30.78
as I'm concerned. And I, I, that makes one of us. I am happy to fill in, though, man. Honestly,

1568
02:30:30.78 --> 02:30:35.26
it's it's super cool to sit at the table. I've said this to you and probably Dave too, man,

1569
02:30:35.26 --> 02:30:40.30
hollowed ground. The people who've sat around this table, man. It's something special. So

1570
02:30:40.30 --> 02:30:45.74
super cool to be able to do it today. For sure. Right on. So we're getting some

1571
02:30:45.74 --> 02:30:51.18
jockel fuel, jockelfield.com. Jockelfield.com. We're getting some discipline go going to walla

1572
02:30:51.18 --> 02:30:56.30
and just clearing shelves. That's where we're at. If you go to walla and you clear a shelf, let me

1573
02:30:56.30 --> 02:31:00.14
tell you what you're doing. You're helping every other trooper in America. That's what you're doing

1574
02:31:00.14 --> 02:31:07.02
because as other convenience chains see what's going on at walla, they're like, oh, oh, okay,

1575
02:31:07.02 --> 02:31:14.78
we got it. So roll into walla and just get some just clear shelves. Um, while was got something going on

1576
02:31:14.78 --> 02:31:20.22
right now, right? We do. Yeah. If it's October, if it's listening to this, yeah, right on you, you,

1577
02:31:20.22 --> 02:31:24.86
you buy one and you get another one for a buck. Maybe missed it. Which is kind of dope. I don't

1578
02:31:24.86 --> 02:31:29.98
mean, miss any of this comes out tonight tomorrow night. Yeah, right on. Kadaox just going to roll

1579
02:31:29.98 --> 02:31:37.18
right in. Hey, get out the wall for that bogo action. Uh, oh, look at you. That's not got one though.

1580
02:31:37.18 --> 02:31:43.82
Oh, it's in luck. By one get one if you were a dollar right. Yeah. Uh, joint warfare. Super

1581
02:31:43.82 --> 02:31:50.86
curl. Um, these these things are all battle against that noise we're talking about body, body,

1582
02:31:50.86 --> 02:31:58.38
noise, physical noise. That elbow noise. You got some elbow noise. Oh, always. Well, not, you know,

1583
02:31:58.38 --> 02:32:03.98
I got some shoulder noise. If I'm telling you, if I don't, if I if I miss out on joint warfare,

1584
02:32:03.98 --> 02:32:08.78
it's a problem. That's why I don't miss out on it. Joint warfare and super curl. That's my,

1585
02:32:08.78 --> 02:32:12.70
that's my go to man. Get rid of that noise. How about that moke?

1586
02:32:14.14 --> 02:32:18.86
Dave, you could all night walk train. Are you still on strawberry? Yeah. Did you even on strawberry

1587
02:32:18.86 --> 02:32:22.94
for a while? I don't know what's going to ever. I mean, I have them all. I got to line up in my

1588
02:32:22.94 --> 02:32:28.54
closet or my, my pantry, but it's, it's like, um, you know, it's like afterburner orange for me.

1589
02:32:28.54 --> 02:32:33.02
That's what I'm going to. It's strawberry's the best. Do you, so right now you're drinking

1590
02:32:33.02 --> 02:32:36.86
what, back savage? What do you got over there? I got a deck right in front of them. So at the, at the,

1591
02:32:36.86 --> 02:32:41.34
at the gym here, we were out of afterburner orange, which I know is no big surprise to you.

1592
02:32:43.66 --> 02:32:49.66
But do you ever think, uh, I almost wavered today on chocolate Palmer. I was like, you know,

1593
02:32:49.66 --> 02:32:53.74
maybe I'll go to traffic thunder. Because traffic thunder, especially when it's cold,

1594
02:32:54.78 --> 02:33:01.18
it's freaking legit. But you're still strawberry. Yes. And milk strawberry. That's it. Dude,

1595
02:33:01.18 --> 02:33:08.06
I mixed nothing in that. It's strawberry and milk. And that's it. I don't like, and hey,

1596
02:33:08.06 --> 02:33:11.74
no criticism of that's your game, but like, in the stuff that people put in there and like,

1597
02:33:11.74 --> 02:33:16.70
I put in the sugar cup, I shake it up when I drink it and there's nothing I want to echo

1598
02:33:16.70 --> 02:33:21.58
Charles over here. He's got to go to the grocery store. What, bro, no, I'm saying the frozen banana

1599
02:33:21.58 --> 02:33:26.78
game changer all day, all day that frozen banana, something about that. Tell us it's not word.

1600
02:33:26.78 --> 02:33:31.82
Oh, man. How does it, when you, when you, you got to blend it then, too. Yeah. That's a whole

1601
02:33:31.82 --> 02:33:36.62
issue. Well, here's the thing with me. I like to eat sure, but you know, some people,

1602
02:33:37.66 --> 02:33:42.14
they, they, they, they have like a hole. It's a, it's a ritual, right? And they're going to get,

1603
02:33:42.14 --> 02:33:47.18
they go to the store and they're like, picking stuff up and then they try to rip the grill. And

1604
02:33:47.18 --> 02:33:52.30
now I got a nice grill and everything, I, I, you've, I'll put in the microwave, like, I'm not,

1605
02:33:52.30 --> 02:33:56.70
I'm not firing that thing up. I'm one of those people. We're looking for a fish. Yes. Oh, I will,

1606
02:33:56.70 --> 02:34:03.82
I will open up a can of chicken from Costco and just, that's dinner. If my wife didn't make good

1607
02:34:03.82 --> 02:34:12.06
food, I would just be eating, you know, a can of, of chicken. You'd be on that K dog. Yeah. I put on the

1608
02:34:12.06 --> 02:34:18.62
K dog routine. It's for the single life. Oh, yes. It is for long eating. Yeah. Two cups of green

1609
02:34:18.62 --> 02:34:25.58
beans, some Hawaiian rolls. You're ready to rock and roll. So, but you know what is good. That's

1610
02:34:25.58 --> 02:34:31.82
why I'm not, I'm not exploring the freaking half frozen well ripe banana or whatever it is we're doing.

1611
02:34:31.82 --> 02:34:37.66
Right. I'm over here. I'm with Dave. I'm like milk. Milk. We're good. But here's a thing for me. That milk

1612
02:34:37.66 --> 02:34:41.82
milk combo. Yeah. My scale. You know, I'm giving it. I give it a 10. Yeah. I'm giving it a 10. It's like,

1613
02:34:41.82 --> 02:34:47.10
I'm just suffering through the 7 6.0. It's a 10. That's it. We're all this other stuff you're doing.

1614
02:34:47.10 --> 02:34:52.30
You know what's going to get you to a 10. Yeah. That's where I'm at right now. So I don't need it. Yeah. I'm the same way.

1615
02:34:52.30 --> 02:35:00.14
Now I will say I'm, I'm not solo on one flavor right now. I'm, I'm bouncing around. I

1616
02:35:00.14 --> 02:35:05.58
used to go like one month on a flavor and then I go in three weeks on another flavor. They go

1617
02:35:05.58 --> 02:35:10.70
back to another flavor for a month. I'm kind of, I'm kind of getting crazy right now. I'll be, you know,

1618
02:35:10.70 --> 02:35:15.82
I'll be even doing, you know, it makes it up during the day. You know, lunch is going to be some

1619
02:35:15.82 --> 02:35:20.94
painter butter. Dinner's going to be some men, right? Got some, you know, I'm over here close

1620
02:35:20.94 --> 02:35:25.42
minded. Not free thinking. Yeah. I got strawberry. I'm going to stick with strawberry for about 25

1621
02:35:25.42 --> 02:35:32.22
years. We'll just some other time. I wrote a lot for the drinks. Vitamin shop. Get all the stuff

1622
02:35:32.22 --> 02:35:39.66
at the vitamin shop. And Jockelfuel.com. What? Commissaire? Oh, that's right. Maybe commissaire. That's right.

1623
02:35:39.66 --> 02:35:46.14
That's right. Good call. K dog. 100% we're in there. We're in there. Jockelfuel.com. If you, yeah,

1624
02:35:46.14 --> 02:35:53.18
also subscribe. If you subscribe, you get this shipping for free. What up? Just where do we stand on

1625
02:35:53.18 --> 02:36:03.82
greens? Okay. We have greens. Jockelfuel greens. They're amazing. Dude, they're amazing.

1626
02:36:03.82 --> 02:36:11.58
Yeah. Really, truly are amazing. Yes. They are, they are, they're hard to make. If you look at

1627
02:36:11.58 --> 02:36:17.34
the ingredients list, it's all organic. The whole product together is not certified organic because

1628
02:36:17.34 --> 02:36:23.02
we haven't gone through that process yet. But every ingredient in there is, or I think every ingredient

1629
02:36:23.02 --> 02:36:28.94
is organic. So it's hard to make it. So that's why I'm not talking about it at all because

1630
02:36:28.94 --> 02:36:34.54
people that are kind of in the know. I'm like, I'm not trying to screw them. Just tell everyone

1631
02:36:34.54 --> 02:36:40.06
that this is the greatest beverage. Yeah. It's certainly, it's certainly is the greatest greens.

1632
02:36:40.06 --> 02:36:44.78
But, and not even close. It's not even close. It tastes delicious. The go look at the ingredients

1633
02:36:44.78 --> 02:36:50.54
list too. It is the best quality sweetened with monk fruit. You know what I've been doing?

1634
02:36:50.54 --> 02:36:55.18
Is I've been having that? Like, let's, because sometimes you know, I get done with the steak at night.

1635
02:36:56.22 --> 02:37:03.50
And I want dessert. But I'm full. So that monk is sort of looking like a little bit much.

1636
02:37:04.86 --> 02:37:10.22
Outcomes the green. Outcomes the greens. Like wine people. They drink whatever it is.

1637
02:37:10.22 --> 02:37:15.82
Apport. Right? Apport. Can I get a glass of port? When I'm feeling that way,

1638
02:37:15.82 --> 02:37:21.82
since I'm a frequent savage, I'm just ordering up a glass of greens. Shake it up the green.

1639
02:37:21.82 --> 02:37:26.06
Shake it up some greens. I brought it up and I don't want to alien it. The listeners who maybe

1640
02:37:26.06 --> 02:37:30.78
don't have access and you can edit all this stuff out. If it feels people have access, but here's

1641
02:37:30.78 --> 02:37:35.42
the deal on the greens. You want to go back to the three categories of leaders, which is the

1642
02:37:35.42 --> 02:37:40.54
fully anticipates the outcome. Shocked by the outcome and can't process the outcome. When I

1643
02:37:40.54 --> 02:37:47.02
drank my first container of greens, I was really in category C like what is happening?

1644
02:37:48.54 --> 02:37:56.54
The delta between what I expected and what I got, it was insane. Those things are, it is unbelievable

1645
02:37:56.54 --> 02:38:02.46
how good they taste for what you think it's going to taste like because it's greens. It was an absolute

1646
02:38:02.46 --> 02:38:07.18
mind blowing experience. I've been doing it in the morning and it everyone else gave you like a

1647
02:38:07.18 --> 02:38:13.82
little bit of kick, right? That other kick. It's just good to go. So yeah, listen, if you go online

1648
02:38:13.82 --> 02:38:19.18
you order the greens awesome. If we're out, we're making them more as fast as we can. I apologize,

1649
02:38:19.18 --> 02:38:25.58
logistics, wins or wars. We're working it. We're losing that war right now. We're in the game

1650
02:38:25.58 --> 02:38:29.50
and we'll try and get you some more. That's the kind of thing you want to subscribe to.

1651
02:38:29.50 --> 02:38:34.38
Because you want that order getting filled. Don't want to be waiting for you.

1652
02:38:34.38 --> 02:38:39.02
No, you're drinking it, Dave. Everyone. It's like, so just immediately into my habit pattern.

1653
02:38:39.02 --> 02:38:45.50
I haven't since I got it, haven't missed a day. It was, it's everything you just said. I just want

1654
02:38:45.50 --> 02:38:49.34
people to realize like what you think you're getting with greens. Like everybody knows what greens

1655
02:38:49.34 --> 02:38:52.14
are cool. They're healthy. You sort of need to stomach them and just kind of like hold your

1656
02:38:52.14 --> 02:38:56.62
nose and get to them because they're good for you. Yeah, go to your lawnmower. Get the clipping

1657
02:38:56.62 --> 02:39:01.18
out. That's what you think. That's what you think you're getting, right? And you're not. The

1658
02:39:01.18 --> 02:39:07.50
original media team did this double blind video, double blind study video from the emerging

1659
02:39:07.50 --> 02:39:13.66
cap and it's awesome. People are just like, oh, hey, oh my gosh. This is green. It doesn't even,

1660
02:39:13.66 --> 02:39:19.34
it doesn't even compute. That can be that good. So, there you go. It's a good origin.

1661
02:39:20.14 --> 02:39:25.66
Speaking of origin, we got a geese, rash guards apparel coming out of origin USA.

1662
02:39:25.66 --> 02:39:31.50
Right. Yeah. Doing boots up there now. Yeah. We're doing it all. I'm going to, we're going to make

1663
02:39:31.74 --> 02:39:37.42
everything that we use in life. That's the goal. The goal is to make everything that we use

1664
02:39:38.30 --> 02:39:43.50
in life and we're going to make it in America. And let me tell you what, that's a, that's no

1665
02:39:43.50 --> 02:39:49.98
small task. And we're getting it done. Jeans, boots. We got work pants coming out.

1666
02:39:49.98 --> 02:39:54.46
I saw those on the ground. I'll tell you what, man. That's another thing like we're going to make

1667
02:39:54.46 --> 02:40:01.74
them as fast as we can. As soon as people get a pair or see a pair, they're, they're going to be gone.

1668
02:40:02.62 --> 02:40:07.50
And, you know what, we're, we're up in our capacity. Again, logistics wins wars. I know that.

1669
02:40:07.50 --> 02:40:14.62
And we are working it. And it's, we're in a good place because the rest of people that do this,

1670
02:40:14.62 --> 02:40:19.66
they got to rely on a foreign supply chain. Even in some cases, a communist supply chain.

1671
02:40:19.66 --> 02:40:26.86
With literally fabrics that are made by communists who, you know, have a dictatorship in their

1672
02:40:26.86 --> 02:40:32.46
country. And they're paying people, you know, $1 a week to make the material. So,

1673
02:40:33.74 --> 02:40:41.74
this is like a strategic for America, strategic for America. That's why we're doing it.

1674
02:40:41.74 --> 02:40:47.50
Could we, hey, could we freaking cut some corners and up that profit margin by whatever? Sure,

1675
02:40:47.50 --> 02:40:53.42
we're good, but we're freaking not going to. So, if you want some, if you wear clothes,

1676
02:40:54.86 --> 02:41:03.02
then you might want to get your clothes from a strategic partner of yourself. And that is us at

1677
02:41:03.02 --> 02:41:11.74
Origin USA. What up? I got nothing else for that, man. Dare to the shirt, baby. We, if you're also

1678
02:41:11.74 --> 02:41:19.82
looking for clothes to say represent the path, you can find those on jacostor.jacostor.com. We got

1679
02:41:20.54 --> 02:41:27.50
discipline equals freedom. We got, um, take the high ground on there still. I like how you're

1680
02:41:27.50 --> 02:41:33.02
co-opting some of it echoes phrases. You're kind of like you're utilizing them, you know,

1681
02:41:33.02 --> 02:41:40.78
not totally copying them 100% but you're catching the vibe and you're putting your K dog spin on a

1682
02:41:40.78 --> 02:41:49.50
it's been watching the master work from the corner. Shout out at Kotrols. Yeah, man. So,

1683
02:41:49.50 --> 02:41:56.38
got all that going on at jacostor.com. Also have a T-shirt subscription from the big dog echo

1684
02:41:56.38 --> 02:42:04.94
Trolls called the shirt locker where he makes rad shirts with layers from the podcast. So,

1685
02:42:04.94 --> 02:42:08.94
if you're, if you're about those layers, if you listen to the podcast, you're like, yes,

1686
02:42:08.94 --> 02:42:13.98
like I'm about the layers, check out the shirt locker that goes cranking out a new shirt every

1687
02:42:13.98 --> 02:42:20.14
month with a different layer from the podcast presented on them. You're both of you are wearing

1688
02:42:20.14 --> 02:42:26.70
good shirt locker. Sure. I know. Check the sock. The sock T shirt. We represent right. We come here to

1689
02:42:26.70 --> 02:42:33.26
to get after it and we're representing that. Right. And so me and echo like sometimes show

1690
02:42:33.26 --> 02:42:41.18
where in the same shirt today, me, Dave Bart showed up rocking the sock shirt, which is legit. The

1691
02:42:41.18 --> 02:42:46.86
sock support. So, echo showed it to me. He's like, he's approved for a nice day, man. We can't

1692
02:42:46.86 --> 02:42:53.10
be running around just throw and sock on to a t-shirt and being good with that anymore than you can

1693
02:42:53.10 --> 02:43:00.46
just throw a tried in on a shirt and be like, oh yeah, I'll just represent. So, the way we got

1694
02:43:00.46 --> 02:43:05.66
around that is by putting support on there. So, it's like, you know, like when you're, if you're

1695
02:43:05.66 --> 02:43:11.34
maybe you support a local bike or gang, but you're not in the bike or gang, but you got friends,

1696
02:43:11.34 --> 02:43:17.50
you can wear that bike or gang stuff, but you got to have support on there. You're because you're

1697
02:43:17.50 --> 02:43:23.10
not trying to claim at all. You don't want to try to claim sock. But we freaking support. It's

1698
02:43:23.10 --> 02:43:32.62
100%. 100%. 100%. Absolutely. So, all that's going on at jaccostore.com. Yeah, uh, subscribe to this podcast,

1699
02:43:32.62 --> 02:43:38.78
wherever you subscribe to podcast, we also have jacco unraveling and that's with Darryl Cooper DC.

1700
02:43:38.78 --> 02:43:45.90
We just did want about Afghanistan. That was kind of the lead up to this one a little bit just because

1701
02:43:46.54 --> 02:43:53.18
we were debriefing what happened on Afghanistan and clearly there's some military incompetence that

1702
02:43:53.90 --> 02:44:00.54
has risen up in the ranks and we started to address that on on jacco unraveling with Darryl Cooper.

1703
02:44:00.54 --> 02:44:03.82
Got the grounded podcast which we haven't done a while and were your kid podcast. I know I got

1704
02:44:03.82 --> 02:44:08.78
to get back on that one. So, subscribe to those. Check them out. Also, we have jacco underground

1705
02:44:08.78 --> 02:44:15.26
jacco underground.com. We have a secondary podcast where like I started off talking today about

1706
02:44:15.26 --> 02:44:21.10
how we talk about psychology on that one quite a bit because that stuff interests me and that stuff

1707
02:44:21.10 --> 02:44:24.78
also helps you understand the world. And if you understand the world and you understand people,

1708
02:44:24.78 --> 02:44:28.14
you can be a better leader, you can be a better person, you can be a better mom dad, whatever.

1709
02:44:28.14 --> 02:44:34.38
Yet it didn't quite some of the subjects don't quite fit into this podcast. So, we made

1710
02:44:34.38 --> 02:44:41.66
jacco underground jacco underground.com and that's that podcast is like a little reward for support

1711
02:44:42.38 --> 02:44:49.98
because we wanted to create an alternative and alternative platform in case of these platforms.

1712
02:44:51.58 --> 02:44:55.98
Which they haven't caused me problems yet. Hey, we're on board. We're here. We appreciate it.

1713
02:44:55.98 --> 02:45:03.02
We appreciate the platforms. But you can't put all your reliance on something that you have no control

1714
02:45:03.02 --> 02:45:06.62
over and we don't really have any control over these large platforms. So, we want to make something

1715
02:45:06.62 --> 02:45:13.02
just a case. Hey, we'll be here. But just in case things get wild, we got the jacco underground.com.

1726
02:46:12.54 --> 02:46:17.42
And stand by for the audio book. There's some. Oh yeah. So on the audio, if you get the audio book of

1727
02:46:17.42 --> 02:46:25.74
that, I read the audio book. And then we did Dave and I did about an hour conversation about just

1728
02:46:27.10 --> 02:46:31.98
a review talking about the characters, the character development, the lack of character development,

1729
02:46:31.98 --> 02:46:37.58
the plot development, the lack of plot development. The words used, the lack of words used.

1730
02:46:37.58 --> 02:46:43.42
Just all these things that will definitely be interesting. And it's been amazing so far.

1731
02:46:43.42 --> 02:46:46.94
The books that books coming out should do like a virtual book signing or something would be cool to

1732
02:46:46.94 --> 02:46:52.54
get that out there. I think I am doing a virtual book signing and I'm not 100% sure where. And

1733
02:46:52.54 --> 02:46:58.70
actually check this out. Speaking of virtual book signing in November, I'm going to do two

1734
02:46:58.70 --> 02:47:04.70
jockel lives. Jockel lives. Ready one in looks like San Diego, California, November and then

1735
02:47:04.70 --> 02:47:09.66
Austin, Texas in November. I think those are the only dates. Look, things are wild right now with

1736
02:47:09.66 --> 02:47:15.42
the COVID and the protocols and all this stuff. And people are really sketched out, especially some of the

1737
02:47:16.06 --> 02:47:19.58
some of the places you can give. You can do these events. Some of them have

1738
02:47:20.70 --> 02:47:25.26
whatever. They're freaked out about it. So we found some places that are down for the cause.

1739
02:47:25.26 --> 02:47:32.22
So we're going to do a gig. I'm going to do a gig, jockel life, November, in San Diego and November in

1740
02:47:32.22 --> 02:47:38.94
Austin, Texas. So keeping out for that. It'll be an intro to final spin. It gives you time to read it.

1741
02:47:38.94 --> 02:47:43.90
The book does not take long to read. So you'll be able to get the book. Get the book when it comes

1742
02:47:43.90 --> 02:47:48.94
out November 9th and then by the time November 13th or November 20th, which I think of the

1743
02:47:48.94 --> 02:47:53.74
dates on those two. I'll be there. And you can ask me questions about it. I'll talk about some of

1744
02:47:54.46 --> 02:48:00.54
somewhere all that came from the darkness in my brain. That's final spin.

1780
02:51:30.78 --> 02:51:37.50
walk away and they say, oh, you're going to leave me on red. Wow. Yeah. Nice. And I think I do that

02:51:44.94 --> 02:51:55.74

02:51:55.74 --> 02:52:02.14

02:52:18.70 --> 02:52:26.70

Open up your mind. Don't be the person that is love to accept contrary evidence to what you

1791
02:52:55.98 --> 02:53:02.14
already believe. Don't be that person. Don't get stuck in that rut. Open your mind free your mind
