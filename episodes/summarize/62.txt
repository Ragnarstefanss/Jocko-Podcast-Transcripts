Like when he talks about this modern warfare of, you know, and even when I talk about like, hey guys going out the turret, you know, guys going out on the operation after operation in the money, sometimes you know, guys would think they're going to die. And when those guys came over again, a bunch of great dudes, you know, I talked to him when we got home and then they got home and one of the guys a good friend of mine and he came and worked with me in the training department and you know, we would have that conversation a couple times where, you know, Mikey Montsore got killed, you know, September 29th and those guys were now coming on deployment a week, maybe two weeks later to come over and start getting a turnover from us. Like we did into you, Bruser and those guys, I was friends with good friends with a number of the guys in there and and so we're late and the other, you know, all the guys we had friends that were back, you know, back in the in that task and that was coming to relieve us and it's taking what you're saying and multiplying it times a lot because when we went to Ramadi, we weren't really sure, you know, oh, You're not, maybe not specific, but no one's going, oh, you know, I'm really, you know, I'm really, you know, believe me, we get guys that think they're going to die every 10 that go out. But that is just, you know, I've talked about World War I, I don't like World War I, I don't want to fight World War I because you know, as a matter of a tactician, you are, you are just going to charge and it's going to be horrible. And dupeak, like many other great military leaders, especially ones that I've seen to like, use a little bit of a rebel, spoke his mind, kind of like, kind of like hackworth, kind of like patent. Not only you not know what the opponent's going to do, you don't know what passes are going to be caught and dropped and what the ref's going to call. He was like, that's, he said, that's not going to happen to our guys because we had a bunch of, you know, bad ass studs because that's not going to happen to our guys. If it will modern combat, you know, little ditched to hide and find a little doorway, you're going to get into, especially in this kind of, you know, this is a little bit pre-world war one, obviously, but they're still charging, right? It's like when you're on a plane and you think this plane, you know, if this plane crashes, you know, a big commercial plane jetliner or whatever, I think I'm going to live. So he's talking about you know what and Tony said this and this is a common team guy thing to say you know I would rather die than look like a pussy and it's like Well, here's something like if there's music on certain things, like you like to listen to certain, like, you know, you hear a speech. So you know what, hey, we're starting, I'm just going to surrender, but give up on the, you know, you're not going to fight with that same kind of bigger. And we got to pay attention to guys that get combat fatigue and it's going to get, you know, guys will get scared and it's going to break them down and all that. Like we get to a pre staging point and now you're waiting to go, okay, you've got all the stuff going through your mind, what if this happens, what if this happens, what if this guys moves, what if they do this, you've got all this turmoil going in your mind. The only way you can know what's going to happen in a war is the war happens and things are going to happen that you will not expect ever and you got to deal with. I'm going to, you know, I think I'm going to live like if you fall out of the plane. And World War II going on to go on to a beach going on where you're, you know, we're going to take 40% casualties first two waves. It's what it feels like, you know, I'm going to stick with that for right now unless it, you know, produces roadblocks. You know, so it's like, oh, man, this one really, like I'm feeling this one, you know, so all let's make that one into a video. You know, that means you're looking at your body like, okay, one of us ain't going to make it or one of us is at least going to get wounded bad. Yeah, because so it's kind of like if you make them not want to fight, they're not going to really want to fight or not going to fight. And you know, we had swims that there's a like, you know, a strong ocean current going the opposite direction. And by the way, it's not just you that doesn't know all your little, all your other people in the C-suite, they don't know what's going on either. Step number two we add good arms we add methods of fighting suitable to these arms and those of the enemy and which do not overtax the physical and moral forces of man so you gotta give them good weapons and the weapons have gotta be easy to use and suitable for the enemy that you're going against. It's like you're part of like, you know, when you see a like the movie, no country for old men. And he's like, you know, when you're in a bad situation and you're confusing a stronger enemy, you can just count on the guys are going to run away. I mean, modern modern surrenders, you know, they take place almost like a formal, yeah, you know, you come in your general comes and surrounds signs the paper So, you know, when I talked to my buddy that was the senior listed guy, you know, he, he, I said, man, what was that like? What it was, he said, you know, if I ever didn't put him on the forced list of the guys going out, he'd come to me like, what's the problem? but I think, yes, I think once I think once you get to combat, because there's, you know, there's times where guys that obviously are seals made it through buds, they don't want to be in combat. We got a lot of stock and you would actually know that you need it because deadlifting, you know you need that 8,000 pound increase, which by the way is guaranteed. You know we did some, you know for us the US military, we're going against a gnarly enemy. And just standing there watching it waiting for him to go down so you can step up and by the way, you know, like you know me. So in war, like, if you're, like, on the save of our own, and there's a small little clip where the guys are like surrendering, and they still shoot them. The only way you do, you do know what's going on is by being really proactive and finding out what's going on. So you might think like, well, they got goods 360 security and that's why it's good or without their, you know, unit that's easy to control. And and I guess part of that a little 10% of that was like, hey, if I do get killed, whatever, I could go, you know, this is this kind of a good way to die. So he's a guy that like, like, I don't know, that's just the way he dealt with it. You're not going to know everything that's going on. Like, um, you know, obviously protein powder and stuff, but they'll have like wellness stuff though, uh, multi-bite, but they have toothpaste.
