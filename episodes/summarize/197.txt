what you can step up and win And how about when if you can know all the right things to do but if you lack the fortitude and discipline To do it this you're it does like how many doctors know all the right things about health and yet maybe are not in great shape So they know the things to do but they don't do this as I'm saying kind of thing Maybe don't see this very often anymore, but like doctors that smoke Well now I guess you just get doctors that eat crap right horrible, There's a reason why the guys in Vietnam taught us to do that Because as long as you know what your fields of firearm you can you can go hot if you're in an L shaped Ambush or you're in an L shaped assault the minute I put people You know whether it's 270 degrees around the target or 360 degrees I can't I now I have to worry about my backdrop and it's a real problem and you know what you can get away with those You can get away with enveloping a target all day long as long as there's no shooting but the minute the enemy starts shooting It's a problem So there are ways to cover exits from an L You extend that a little bit you can put some overwatches in But it is a real problem to think that you're gonna develop a target in a small you know Let's say with with direct fire weapons Company size or smaller. And It might be the worst decision sometimes no decision while I watch things develop You might be the right call but let's be clear no decision is a decision What I've been trying to teach people lately Is like a standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do Here's the standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do you Look at what the situation where you take you did that you take a step back you look at what's unfolding Then you make the smallest Decision in the area that you guess is the right direction to move I was just reading a note from a friend of mine A team guy who's who's grandfather was in World War II still life gonna get him on the podcast and When he did the island campaign And then went into like Japan surrender after the bombs and the Japanese were told on your gun in placements put a white flag Like so Americans were sailing in like the wars over sailing in I think it was into like I don't use it is into some big port Japan and When he was sailing in there was just white flags everywhere Everywhere and he was looking around he said it he said it literally looked like snow I'm wired like call a corny, but you know high-landered like You know how you would absorb like the strength of like that's kind of kind of like Well, you know HR and how do I can possibly you have to still find a way to do that appropriately because HR doesn't have anything to do with having discipline process procedure You know no, no, I'm talking about getting in and knowing what's going on with your people and in their life and And doing hard things together, you know because I think what people call you got to show up on time do this part of your job We've learned that over and over again In strany us combat troops are soon worn out and quickly used up The forces must receive timely reinforcements in leaders men animals battle needs and War materials of all kinds Boys are gonna get worn out after a while the mission and the situation form the basis of action The mission and the situation form the basis of action the mission designates the objective to be a chain to be attained The leader must never forget his mission a mission which indicates several tasks easily Deverts from the main exit objective so once again prioritize next year If you've got a bunch of different things you're not gonna achieve the main objective At a situation recently Where people were wearing some of their teammates out and was talking to this company about how to do this so I learned that very early What you don't you don't and it was great for me because that was another thing that initially taught me Hey, you got your standard operating procedures you got two squads You know you got two squads in a pertinent cool one is base one is assault don't pull the heavy weapons into the base force Because you might need them well, I think and two it's it's if the enemy In the in their he's saying well the enemy is is fixed right you have it it presumes The frontal assault like that's the main effort and and but if that shifts if they become wise to the flanking maneuver and then I'm gonna reassess yes and guess what if it's the wrong decision Now you know that if it's the wrong direction you just you hit a wall there now you just figured that out Where when you made no decision you still you don't you still know which way to go that's right 360 degrees so when I say hey we're gonna go 90 degrees cool we take a step Overwatch we're about to bring online which is gonna be for Everyone in the military because We the demand is so high and look you're in special operations great you got some you know you've got great leadership experience You know who else has great leadership experience In for triple tune commander right on infantry platoon sergeant That's That's Rommel so back was executed Um, but like I said his character obviously was a little bit you know what he had some some good character traits stood up for what he believed in and the fact that this book Trooping through them The fact that this book Is Has been so widely copied the Americans use something based on of the brits you something based the German still use something based on it Really kind of reveals his leadership knowledge so with that we'll go to the book The book Trooping through them am I getting better at saying that sounds good to me trooping for them All right kicks off with the introduction the introduction starts with The conduct of war is an art depending upon free creative activity Scientifically grounded is that the way you think of it. And it's funny because a lot of times people you know what's what you know they asked this question almost like a rhetorical question like But what is a leader you know, but what really is leader there you go yeah, we just just read it I'm gonna take an extra Half hour for lunch every day if that's that's no people don't even want to do that Like people might think they want to do that people might think they want to do that, but they don't want to do that No, they don't want to do that They don't want to do that they want to get after it and that's our job as leaders is to set that bar and to set it even a little bit higher so there's the origination of smieck It's you know it comes from the troop in fear That's where we got good man how this book has it has escaped Like my junior officer training you know what I mean like that's what we're trying to solve right now That's right American made jeans cotton from America woven in America sewn in America by Americans it's awesome and actually available now for the first time for pre-order origin boots origin boots so same thing you know we've we invested in the machinery we found the the old timers that know that did that for the living before Factory started going overseas so check out the origin boots supplements during warfare cruel oil discipline discipline go and also discipline go ready to drink buya I see you've been sucking on that thing over there You drink a lot of those Draco mustard you know It's all the logistics the whole the admin and the last one we have is Command and signal which is how you're gonna communicate and where You know this is when you'd be briefing you'd say uh, you know hey as the task in commander I'm gonna be on this ridge line So we have command and signal the last thing that I say is command post and communications to and from Wonder where we got some Yeah, so that makes it much much harder to read It's like distant you don't really and even for me when I when I'm reading something With all the context I have around it like when I read it Like when I first started reading books that I knew I was gonna do on the podcast it gave me a new level of appreciation before I was reading because I was like So if you're if you're trying to tell everyone exactly what to do guess what Eventually that order's not gonna get through and you know what they're doing they're waiting to hear it because you haven't Descentualized command enough you've you've trained them like a dog only to do what you tell them to do In order should shall contain all that is necessary for the lower commander to know in order for him to execute independently his task It should contain no more Correspondingly the order must be brief and clear decisive in tone and complete Adopted to the understanding of the receiver. and I think it's so important We talk about training and how important training is for preparation like At least at the very least hey you got to read this book at the very least okay, I mean in the absence of that It's like a complete failure, but at least go okay read these books, but you've got to find the time to do the training Read the books and then as a leader Sit down kid. Let's let's let's let's let things develop a little bit more During the course of the battle the commander influences the action most strongly by the concentration and increase of fire and through the employment of his reserve Distribution location and employment of the reserve Require careful consideration mobility increases the possibility For their employment always have a little bit in the tank You know always got to have a little bit in tank Everybody says that you know it's interesting about delaying. But yeah, if you can bring a few people from your team and you can all hear it from the horse's mouth and you can all bounce these ideas off each other It just adds that much more to the Experience and just kind of FY when we do these we go to the hotels The hotel people are like this is the most incredible thing this is the only event where When the doors open at 745 in the morning after we do PT it's at 445 Combat shower When there's people lined up waiting to get in there and then every you know the hotel staff will be like everyone so proactive and nice It's a sort of a test of uh, you know when you're eight years old It was it's always a test of of Of courage basically because you're gonna go in there with a stick Like that they have to see if you can get it to fall down and you know, it's like playing Pinata You don't get it on the first shot. Yeah, so listen to that check those things in the mirror when you're trying to be a leader you know check and see If you're emotionally Detached check and see if you're earnest Boom earnest Check yourself control check your knowledge check your experience all those things Continue on the example and personal conduct of officers and non-commission officers are of decisive influence on the troops Wow the officer who in the face of the enemy is cold-blooded decisive and courageous Inspires his troops onward the officer must likewise find the way to the hearts of his subordinates and gain their trust through the an Understanding of their feelings and thoughts and through never ceasing care of their needs I mean relationships how much we talk on this right It's the complacency while I sit back and our dick kind of went away I wish that no, I just steamed all this you got to make a call now Obviously Having to point this stuff all the time, but it's the truth If you just jump and make rash decisions without thinking about them that's also stupid You have to let things develop but this idea of in action I mean it is the worst that's why what are what are people say about Inaction is a decision so like no decision is the bad decision right? So if you're just hard core fighters it doesn't matter right how many people the enemies got because we're gonna get self The higher the battle worth the more vigorous and versatile can war be executed Superior leadership and Superior troop battle readiness are reliable portence of victory The leaders must live with their troops participate in their dangers their wants their joys their sorrows Only in this way can they estimate the battle worth and the requirements of the troops Sitting around in the ivy tower That's interesting though because we do have a thing in this military about the separation to a certain degree We're talking about like like the Russian so we're a little bit further and And going on in this next couple of sentences you feel whether it's an enemy whether it's a competitor You know when they're going on the attack they're also Expending considerable resources absolutely right But you know it just touched on something real briefly we were about this contrarian mindset There are there are people who just walk around with a contrarian mindset and it doesn't matter what gets said like they are always gonna be like whatever and you gotta do you gotta you gotta make a decision The first time you go in there You see a new guy going in there the first the very first time he's ever done E jammed up and everything's the disaster He does it one time, you know, he looks at it and go okay, you step out due to again. The reports and information of the enemy form one of the most important foundations of the estimate of the situation The decision and its execution you got to know what's going on and it here It talks about air and ground reconnaissance it talks about continual observation it talks about information secured through Special means and I'm sure they're talking about Human resources you know a Human human intelligence so spies or whatever That's not human resources
