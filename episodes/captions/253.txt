[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 253 with Dave Burke and me, Jockel willing.
[00:00:06] Good evening Dave.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] So last couple of podcasts, 251 with Dave Babin, 252, also Dave Burke.
[00:00:14] We're continuing to make our way through this book right here.
[00:00:19] Guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.
[00:00:24] Life and I made it up to page 13. Dave and I, last time we made it up to page 28, it's
[00:00:30] 117 page book.
[00:00:32] It's just almost impossible not to find lessons and save yourself.
[00:00:38] I don't need to worry about that section right there.
[00:00:42] So to take these experiences from this leader and commander and trying to climb.
[00:00:52] That this this book was the guide book for my biggest mentor, Colonel David Hackworth,
[00:00:59] author about face and there's so many threads.
[00:01:03] I just noticed that thread today or the on the last podcast, the thread between General Clark
[00:01:10] and making the men stand to and then then being okay with it once they almost got overrun
[00:01:14] and hackworth.
[00:01:15] I just, there the threads just connected on that last podcast.
[00:01:19] So the threads keep getting connected.
[00:01:22] If you want to see the threads of the way hackworth learned to lead, which in turn taught
[00:01:29] me how to lead, they all tie right back to General Clark.
[00:01:32] So that's what we're doing.
[00:01:33] We're tracking these lessons to their root cause, to their root to the source and learning
[00:01:41] as we do it.
[00:01:42] Part three of Guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.
[00:01:47] First section we get into today.
[00:01:49] We're on chapter five, the conduct of inspections.
[00:01:54] And I'll tell you this as I was as I was parsing this book, the first time I prep for it,
[00:01:59] I thought, life and I were going to get through half of it and I thought, life and I
[00:02:03] will do back to back podcasts.
[00:02:04] We'll do half in one podcast.
[00:02:07] So we'd cover 60 or so pages and then we do half, we just do come do them back to back.
[00:02:11] We made it through 13 pages.
[00:02:14] So now as I'm reading and I'm looking for like the breaking points or where I can go,
[00:02:17] okay, this is a good section.
[00:02:19] This section today, the end of this section we're to cover today is it's it's it's freaking
[00:02:26] epic.
[00:02:27] I don't know, though that we're around very often.
[00:02:32] So we'll get there.
[00:02:33] But this chapter five starts off with the conduct of inspections.
[00:02:38] And the first question is why inspect and then it says there is a saying.
[00:02:41] An organization does well only those things, the boss checks.
[00:02:47] This true is originated in so far as I am concerned from a speech that I heard made by
[00:02:52] a vice president of one of our largest corporations.
[00:02:55] This is not a new thought to anyone who has military experience because I've often heard
[00:03:01] it expressed as anything that has not been inspected has been neglected.
[00:03:06] I changed the way I said that word to neglected.
[00:03:10] But it made it sound a lot better.
[00:03:12] So anything that has not been inspected has been neglected.
[00:03:18] If these sayings are true and I think they are, it follows that anyone who has important
[00:03:21] position must be able to check in on or inspect the operations which he's responsible.
[00:03:27] Life when life saw this, I think I sent a picture of this to life because this is, you
[00:03:33] know, a line that I hear, life say a lot.
[00:03:35] It's a line that he heard me say a lot and we always attribute it to hack worth.
[00:03:40] We always attribute it to hack worth.
[00:03:43] And guess what, it didn't come from hack worth.
[00:03:46] So how to inspect or turn on how to inspect civilians often think of a non-commissioned
[00:03:51] officer and officer as a demon inspector, a demon inspector, a good inspector is certainly not
[00:04:00] a demon, but good inspectors are not plentiful in the army or out of it.
[00:04:05] However, to be a successful non-commissioned officer or a successful officer, one should
[00:04:09] be a competent inspector.
[00:04:11] This quality cannot be attained without a considerable amount of study, planning and
[00:04:15] practice.
[00:04:16] Now, this is interesting because I wasn't sure how much of this section to cover because
[00:04:26] inspections are not something that I utilized to any great extent as a leader.
[00:04:33] And I was a leader.
[00:04:34] I didn't inspections was not one of my big tools.
[00:04:40] And so I thought, well, you know, I'm well talk about it.
[00:04:43] You know, you certainly have to inspect things and I get that and that's why I would say
[00:04:46] that.
[00:04:47] Hey, an organization does well and things to the boss checks.
[00:04:49] I've said that many times and I believe it.
[00:04:52] But also, I believe that if I have to inspect you, that means I'm doing something wrong
[00:04:59] somewhere else.
[00:05:00] And like if I've got it, if my gig is I've got to inspect you, that means I'm making
[00:05:04] some other kind of mistakes somewhere because should I have to inspect that your weapon is
[00:05:09] ready?
[00:05:10] Should I have to inspect that you've prepared for an operation?
[00:05:12] Should I have to inspect that you've done the work that you're supposed to?
[00:05:15] I shouldn't have to inspect if I've led correctly, then you know why you're doing what
[00:05:21] you're doing.
[00:05:22] And therefore, you don't really need to get inspected because you understand the why and
[00:05:27] you make things happen.
[00:05:28] So I've always had that attitude and it's been very successful for me.
[00:05:31] So I wasn't sure how much I was going to get into this whole inspection mode because
[00:05:35] what I don't want to do is create a bunch of leaders that are going out there becoming
[00:05:37] these inspection happy, you know, dig down hell, coming in and inspect you.
[00:05:41] You know what's funny with my kids?
[00:05:45] If you know my kids, whenever my wife's not around, my kids are, they have to do everything,
[00:05:51] right?
[00:05:52] And so I'll say, are you, you know, what time will you be ready for inspection?
[00:05:56] Or are they just get so they know what that means?
[00:05:59] I'm going to inspect, I'm going to inspect and they're better be squared away.
[00:06:03] So I didn't want to create, I don't want to pass on this idea that, hey, you guys got
[00:06:10] to be inspection, inspection freak.
[00:06:14] You know, I never want people to think that the military is what the military is portrayed
[00:06:18] in boot camp, which is you're getting inspected all the time.
[00:06:23] So that being said, as I read through this, I thought my better cover this because, well,
[00:06:30] you'll see.
[00:06:31] So here we go, back to the book.
[00:06:34] It is very seldom that I visit a unit in installation or headquarters that I do not see
[00:06:38] things which are apparently not correct and which need pointing out, which only need
[00:06:43] pointing out to get them promptly corrected.
[00:06:45] So it's very seldom that you go somewhere and you see something to go, hey, man, why
[00:06:48] isn't that right?
[00:06:49] And all you have to do is tell them that it's not right and they fix it.
[00:06:53] I notice a similar situation in reading the reports of the Inspector General inspections.
[00:06:57] I often wonder why the responsible person on the spot has not noticed them and corrected
[00:07:02] them.
[00:07:03] Like, you're there.
[00:07:05] Why don't you notice that this shortfall exists?
[00:07:09] Here's one reason.
[00:07:10] It may be because he has lived so close to them that his ability to notice them has become
[00:07:15] fatigued.
[00:07:16] So what does that mean?
[00:07:17] You're not detached.
[00:07:18] You're not detached, so you don't see these mistakes.
[00:07:21] What I am inclined to think that it is because, so that's a possibility, but I am inclined
[00:07:25] to think that is because he has not conducted his inspections in a systematic and effective
[00:07:30] way.
[00:07:31] So even when you're not detached, even when you're totally engaged, if you inspect correctly,
[00:07:37] you should still be able to pick up on things that you would otherwise miss.
[00:07:43] Too often officers and senior uncommissioned, noncommissioned officers have a general
[00:07:48] looksy rather than an inspection.
[00:07:52] They go through their areas of responsibility without noticing things to correct and what
[00:07:56] is more without noticing good things for which someone should be complimented.
[00:08:00] That's one of the reasons why I had to cover this.
[00:08:02] Because an inspection isn't about finding what I can nitpick about you.
[00:08:05] It's actually about what I can find to compliment you on.
[00:08:10] Totally different attitude.
[00:08:12] My purpose for inspecting you is so I can find things that you're doing awesome at
[00:08:15] and compliment you for.
[00:08:20] To become a good inspector requires, as I have said before, study planning and practice.
[00:08:25] It requires study to be sure that he knows what is correct and what is not correct in
[00:08:29] the field of his responsibility.
[00:08:31] It requires planning to prepare a schedule of inspections in such a way that over a period
[00:08:36] of time he has given the necessary attention to all aspects of his field of responsibility.
[00:08:41] And then it requires practice in order to notice promptly whether the important things
[00:08:45] are correct or incorrect.
[00:08:46] Notice he said important things.
[00:08:49] Important things and you can absolutely get bogged down in things that are not important.
[00:08:54] In fact, the military, if you're not careful, you will start to focus on things that are
[00:09:00] not important.
[00:09:01] On the last podcast you were talking about the fact that when you were a squadron commander,
[00:09:07] your attitude was, we are inspection ready at all times.
[00:09:11] Does that mean that we scrub the grout on the backside of the whatever bathroom in the
[00:09:17] third floor?
[00:09:19] No, because does that really matter?
[00:09:21] Is that an important thing?
[00:09:22] No, is it clean?
[00:09:23] Yes, it's clean.
[00:09:24] Absolutely, it's clean.
[00:09:25] It's fully functional.
[00:09:28] It's totally ready.
[00:09:29] But we're not wasting time on it because it's not really that important.
[00:09:32] What is important?
[00:09:33] The mechanics of the freaking aircraft.
[00:09:36] The cleanliness of the area where we're actually doing work that keeps these machines
[00:09:41] up and running.
[00:09:43] If I had my guy scrubbed the grout of the bathrooms prior to someone coming to visit,
[00:09:48] I'm telling them that's what I care about.
[00:09:51] And that's not what I want them to care about.
[00:09:55] In the study phase, most people find that a checklist is necessary.
[00:10:01] Think about that.
[00:10:02] A checklist is necessary.
[00:10:04] This ensures that you can tell.
[00:10:05] I've been picking this up as a reading this.
[00:10:08] General Clark is kind of an anal root that I've do for sure.
[00:10:11] He's about checklists.
[00:10:12] He's about inspections.
[00:10:13] He's got that nature to him.
[00:10:16] So we need to keep that in mind.
[00:10:18] We need to keep in mind that why is he, why is this guy with all this experience?
[00:10:22] Why is he using a checklist?
[00:10:24] Why is that?
[00:10:25] Oh, because it works.
[00:10:27] I used to take every single piece of gear that I would take on trips and I would have
[00:10:31] a little checkbox next to it to make sure I had what I need to have.
[00:10:36] Check this.
[00:10:37] Because this ensures that important things are not overlooked and assist the inspector
[00:10:41] until he has become so proficient through practice that he carries a mental checklist in his
[00:10:45] head.
[00:10:46] There are inherent evils in the use of a checklist unless this is made out well.
[00:10:52] It does focus great attention to the items listed which may cause other important things,
[00:10:57] which may have been left off the checklist to be overlooked.
[00:11:02] It must be remembered that two inspect is to emphasize which is what you just said.
[00:11:07] To inspect is to emphasize if you are cleaning the grout on the third floor bathroom,
[00:11:14] that's what you're emphasizing as important.
[00:11:19] And honestly, do I want one minute of time when I'm running an F-35 squadron that has
[00:11:28] multi-million dollar aircraft that are life-saving machines?
[00:11:34] I want anyone scrubbing on the third floor in the third floor bathroom that never gets used
[00:11:39] and never gets seen.
[00:11:41] No.
[00:11:45] In the planning phase, one should make a list of all items or phases of his responsibility
[00:11:49] on which he wants to check in most jobs.
[00:11:51] This list will probably have 30 or 40 items on it.
[00:11:54] It is manifestly impossible in one trip through a platoon, company battalion battle group
[00:11:58] or similar area to check adequately all 40 items.
[00:12:02] Therefore he should keep this list and select from it three or four items each week or
[00:12:06] other interval.
[00:12:07] When he inspects he should do a very thorough job on these selected items.
[00:12:11] Of course, to do a thorough job, he must have studied up on each item selected beforehand,
[00:12:15] so that he knows what is right and what is wrong and what to look for.
[00:12:19] By selecting a new group of three or four items each week, he will over a period of
[00:12:23] time have covered all of them and by the time he comes to the end of the list, he will
[00:12:27] have really checked all the aspects of his responsibility and will become a master of his
[00:12:32] job, what is more at that time if he has been effective as an inspector, his responsibility
[00:12:39] will be carried out in a superior manner.
[00:12:41] Great.
[00:12:42] You know what else is awesome about that?
[00:12:43] What's cooler?
[00:12:44] What's better?
[00:12:45] What to your last podcast about being about humanizing yourself to your troops?
[00:12:52] What does a better job of humanizing?
[00:12:54] Telling you, hey, once every three months I'm going to come and inspect 40 items and it's
[00:12:59] going to take eight hours and you're going to be standing at a period rest of the whole
[00:13:02] time or I'm going to come down once a week.
[00:13:03] I'm going to check two or three things, get to know you, talk to you, game, it's obvious.
[00:13:09] Yeah.
[00:13:10] And maybe even tell you, hey, you're doing an awesome job down here.
[00:13:13] This is good to go.
[00:13:16] Man, the difference.
[00:13:17] Okay.
[00:13:18] Let me ask you this.
[00:13:20] Let's say I'm a nitpicker.
[00:13:22] Let's say I roll down to your flight light.
[00:13:25] And I see that there's whatever some dust on one of these pieces of tools and I walk
[00:13:30] over with my white glove and I inspect it and I hold it up to you and I go, this is junk.
[00:13:37] You're a slob.
[00:13:38] Everything else is quite a bit.
[00:13:39] I year a slob.
[00:13:40] Okay.
[00:13:41] First of all, what do I care about?
[00:13:43] I've showed you that I care about dust and tools.
[00:13:46] And overall, are you inspired to do a good job for me?
[00:13:51] No.
[00:13:53] What if I come down and I look at your toolbox and I go, man, I can see that the way
[00:14:01] you got your tools labeled that you are a professional.
[00:14:05] That is legit.
[00:14:06] You know what?
[00:14:08] Every time I start up one of these aircraft, I'm going to feel good in my heart
[00:14:12] that you're down here, maintaining these aircraft.
[00:14:16] Thank you.
[00:14:17] What is that guy doing?
[00:14:18] That guy's polishing these tools, man.
[00:14:20] He's polishing these tools.
[00:14:22] So do you want to rule out a fear?
[00:14:23] Do you want to rule out of admiration?
[00:14:25] Is that hard?
[00:14:30] If you take one step back and think of the outcome you're trying to create, the real outcome
[00:14:36] that you're trying to create.
[00:14:37] And as a squadron commander, you just described it.
[00:14:39] I want 150 maintainers who are who their entire commitment to life is to make sure these
[00:14:47] airplanes are safe to operate.
[00:14:49] That's what I want.
[00:14:50] A commitment to making sure that we have these machines that are safe.
[00:14:56] If I just think about that, it's actually not hard to go, well, which of these two ways
[00:15:00] is going to get my guy?
[00:15:02] I'm a marine to think the way that I want him to think.
[00:15:04] It's really not that hard.
[00:15:05] You just have to reverse positions to go, how would I feel about the guy coming down
[00:15:09] doing this to make?
[00:15:10] Oh, well, this makes sense.
[00:15:11] That doesn't make sense.
[00:15:12] Just do the one that makes sense.
[00:15:13] And you actually will get the outcome that you want.
[00:15:15] When you're saying that, I was thinking, if you can get a little connection of, hey, hey,
[00:15:20] I noticed these tools over here are kind of dusty.
[00:15:22] Are these kind of a weight?
[00:15:23] Do you not use these?
[00:15:24] Are these not necessary?
[00:15:25] Is this a bunch of stuff that you've got to manage?
[00:15:27] It's not important because these things, obviously, are getting used like crazy.
[00:15:30] Hey, is there a way to kind of relieve you of something?
[00:15:33] Just some connection have to go.
[00:15:34] Actually, sir, those things are terrible.
[00:15:36] We don't use them because they don't work.
[00:15:37] They just hit over there and collect dust.
[00:15:39] It's just an example.
[00:15:40] But if you can make the connection between what they're doing to get the outcome that you
[00:15:44] want, it's actually not that hard to do.
[00:15:48] Man.
[00:15:49] Man.
[00:15:50] All right.
[00:15:51] Back to the book.
[00:15:56] Whether he announces beforehand the items that he is going to check each, you know, that
[00:15:59] hole for that hole conversation we just had, that's like something that we need to continue
[00:16:03] to talk about.
[00:16:06] I see this all the time is like, it's really obvious with ego, right?
[00:16:14] When you're in it, you don't notice how stupid you look.
[00:16:17] And when you step outside and you see someone else behaving that way, you go, oh, this
[00:16:21] person's in any it.
[00:16:22] There he goes involved.
[00:16:23] But when it's you, but no, it's, it's me.
[00:16:26] It's different.
[00:16:27] It's different.
[00:16:28] It's different.
[00:16:29] No one will notice.
[00:16:32] I want that attention.
[00:16:34] I want that he, you didn't recognize me.
[00:16:36] I want, you know what, I want my black belt.
[00:16:39] How's that work?
[00:16:40] Yeah, not good.
[00:16:43] Back to the book.
[00:16:44] Sorry.
[00:16:45] Whether he announces beforehand the items that he is going to check each time as a matter
[00:16:48] of individual choice.
[00:16:49] Some officers, publishers, publishers, publishers to assist in training their subordinates.
[00:16:53] Good results have been obtained that way.
[00:16:55] One basic rule, however, is that having once announced an inspection, he owes it to the
[00:16:59] people underneath him to make it fair and thorough.
[00:17:03] He also owes it to the people, inspect the privilege of being commended for the good things
[00:17:08] found as well as criticism for the things which are not up to standard.
[00:17:13] That whole idea, if you just flip the, I'm inspecting you so I can see what you're doing
[00:17:19] awesome, inspect all the time.
[00:17:21] Totally.
[00:17:25] I have never known a good inspector who did not acquire a highly developed curiosity
[00:17:30] and the ability to notice details.
[00:17:31] This can come to anyone with practice.
[00:17:34] On one occasion, I visited country where units of the Army are stationed.
[00:17:38] I was met at the airfield by a field grade officer of the local headquarters.
[00:17:42] During the ride, during the ride from the airfield unit, I noticed that the civilian
[00:17:48] passenger cars we met had the drivers on the left side, but the large trucks had the
[00:17:53] drivers on the right side.
[00:17:54] This seemed odd to me, so I inquired of my escort why this should be so.
[00:17:58] He remarked that although having been in the country for over a year, he had not noticed
[00:18:02] that.
[00:18:03] I would surprise that he would not develop into your good inspector.
[00:18:07] If you, as either commander or a staff member follow these hints and rules, you will not
[00:18:14] be known as a demon inspector, but as a competent and effective manager.
[00:18:20] And then he says it one more time in big bold print and organization does well only those
[00:18:25] things the boss checks.
[00:18:28] If you're in a leadership role and you're inspecting your people, or if you want to take
[00:18:37] it to set further, if someone else is coming in, like the IG is this in the military,
[00:18:42] the IG is this other group, this inspector general group is another team that actually
[00:18:46] comes into inspect you.
[00:18:48] So whether it's you or somebody else, if I'm a leader and I'm inspecting my people,
[00:18:53] I'm actually just inspecting myself.
[00:18:55] And it's everything I see is a pure reflection of me.
[00:18:58] So the idea that I be down there, design to criticize them for not doing the things I need
[00:19:05] them to do.
[00:19:06] If you just have the mindset in your brain, my inspection of my people is actually an evaluation
[00:19:10] of my own performance.
[00:19:12] It can completely change the way you see what it is that you're looking at.
[00:19:15] The inspection is you.
[00:19:17] And that was part of the reason as a commander and a squadron when I said, listen, Marines,
[00:19:22] if we have we have visitors, you will not allocate additional time to cleaning.
[00:19:27] I said that that was like a standing rule in my squadron.
[00:19:30] If people are coming in to inspect it and inspect our facility, you will not allocate additional
[00:19:34] time to clean.
[00:19:35] I want it to be as clean as it needs to be.
[00:19:37] Do what you would normally do.
[00:19:39] And if they come in and this place is a dump, then I clearly have not allocated the time,
[00:19:44] not done the things I need to do.
[00:19:46] But if they come in and go, hey, this place is good to go.
[00:19:49] That's a reflection of me as a leader, not of my man or my Marines.
[00:19:52] It's me who's being inspected.
[00:19:54] And just that view of what is your actually evaluating?
[00:19:58] Yeah, well, check this out.
[00:20:01] If I come down to inspect Dave and instead of me blaming you for whatever shortfalls you
[00:20:09] have, I say, hey, Dave, I noticed that your tools are not in the proper place.
[00:20:17] And when they're not in the proper place, they could get caught of the flight line, they
[00:20:20] could ruin an engine, someone could hurt or killed.
[00:20:23] I don't think I've done a good job of explaining to you why this is important.
[00:20:28] That's a soundporter.
[00:20:29] So I've failed as a leader.
[00:20:31] The fact that you're not 100% square away is my fault.
[00:20:34] That's why.
[00:20:35] That's why I'm scared of this whole idea a little bit.
[00:20:40] That's why it scares me.
[00:20:41] Even when I say this, an organization does well only those things the boss checks.
[00:20:47] I can tell you that my seal platoon, my seal task unit, my echelon front, does all kinds
[00:20:56] of things exceptionally well that I don't check.
[00:21:01] I know that.
[00:21:04] So that's why I'm a little nervous about trying to make people into hyper inspectors.
[00:21:14] I look at inspection kind of the same way as I look at accountability because they are
[00:21:18] very similar.
[00:21:19] And I've always said, okay, to me, accountability is a crutch.
[00:21:22] Look, it's a tool.
[00:21:23] I'm not saying crutches are bad.
[00:21:25] When you have a broken leg, you got to get a crutch so you can get around.
[00:21:29] Inspections to me are very similar to, in fact, they are a form of accountability.
[00:21:35] But if that's my primary tool for leadership is just to hold everyone accountable and go
[00:21:42] inspect them all the time, that's not a good functioning tool.
[00:21:46] It's not the right way to use that tool.
[00:21:48] If I've got 300 weapons inside task unit bruiser and the only way I can make sure that
[00:21:54] their clean is by inspecting them twice a week, that's an embarrassment to me actually.
[00:21:59] That's an embarrassment to me.
[00:22:00] It's a bearer's commitment to the platoon commanders, it's embarrassment to the platoon
[00:22:03] chiefs and it's a bearer's to everyone in the platoon task unit because we all know why it's
[00:22:08] important to keep our weapon squared away.
[00:22:10] And if we're not in the only way I can get them to do that as to inspect them, it's wrong.
[00:22:15] They should know the culture that we have, they should understand why it's important
[00:22:19] and therefore I shouldn't have to inspect the damn thing.
[00:22:22] Now all that being said, you certainly do, I certainly did inspect the weapons and task
[00:22:31] in a bruiser.
[00:22:32] I didn't do it a lot.
[00:22:33] I did it a couple of times in the beginning just to make sure, hey, everyone gets it,
[00:22:36] everyone knows.
[00:22:38] But after three inspections in the first three months, you think I went down there to make
[00:22:43] sure, I'm just going to make sure, by the way, what kind of trust is that?
[00:22:46] What kind of, am I telling my platoon that I trust them when I, one of the platoons that
[00:22:51] I, am I telling, latef1 that I trust them and I say, hey, latef1, I want to go inspect
[00:22:54] the weapons today.
[00:22:55] He should be able to look at me, don't waste your time boss.
[00:22:57] We're good.
[00:22:58] And you know what I'd say?
[00:22:59] Cool.
[00:23:02] Is there a chance?
[00:23:03] Latef, latef will talk about this.
[00:23:09] He gave a little too much slack one time and didn't have, you know, one was guys and
[00:23:12] do a serialized inventory piece of gear went missing.
[00:23:15] And it's like, he was like, yep, that's all me.
[00:23:19] Latef said that's all me.
[00:23:20] I obviously, little two hands off, little two decentralized.
[00:23:23] So what does that mean?
[00:23:25] I think that's why latef loves that term, loves that phrase so much because he knows
[00:23:30] he had that bite him in the ass.
[00:23:33] He had to start to up the level of inspections.
[00:23:35] So it is a tool.
[00:23:40] It is a tool.
[00:23:41] Don't overuse it.
[00:23:43] Use it.
[00:23:43] Yes.
[00:23:45] Don't overuse it.
[00:23:47] Don't overuse it.
[00:23:50] It's a lack of trust.
[00:23:53] Be careful.
[00:23:55] Yeah, I'm actually over here kind of rack in my brain.
[00:23:58] I'm thinking about my time in command.
[00:24:01] And I was trying to come up with a memory of inspecting something.
[00:24:06] And I couldn't think of like a formal inspection that I did.
[00:24:11] And at the same time, I had a very strong sense in real time of whether my guys are working
[00:24:18] on the things I wanted them to work on.
[00:24:19] Now, I did have a luxury.
[00:24:20] And the answer I came to my head is when I went flying, you're talking about this idea
[00:24:25] of inspection.
[00:24:28] When you go before you get into an airplane, you do what's called a pre flight.
[00:24:31] Which is an inspection.
[00:24:32] Because I started the nose of the airplane.
[00:24:34] I go all the way around.
[00:24:35] I check a bunch of things before I get into the airplane.
[00:24:37] Now, if I overshot the mark, I could walk up to the plane captain.
[00:24:41] We called it the Marine and charge of that plane.
[00:24:43] And I could say, is everything good to go?
[00:24:44] And you could say, yes.
[00:24:45] And the truth is, is that I actually trusted him.
[00:24:48] I could climb up that letter and go fly and come back.
[00:24:52] But if every single time I came out to the jet, I just climbed up and flew that airplane,
[00:24:57] he over time, he'd realize, hey, this guy's not really paying attention.
[00:25:00] And it's not that he, that this guy, Colonel Burke, doesn't care.
[00:25:04] Or doesn't trust me.
[00:25:06] He doesn't care as much.
[00:25:07] It's not that important.
[00:25:08] And I don't want him to think that.
[00:25:11] And at the same time, am I going to spend an hour walking around this airplane going,
[00:25:15] hey, devil dog, come down here.
[00:25:17] I see this thing looking for things that are important, general integrity, and one
[00:25:22] set of blue moon are going, hey, can you come down here for a sec?
[00:25:24] Hey, this thing down here on this panel isn't this, I think it's supposed to be down
[00:25:28] in this switch.
[00:25:29] I think I can get this reader and if I would just show him, hey, these things are important
[00:25:32] to me, what you're doing is important.
[00:25:34] And I'm not looking to find ways to criticize you.
[00:25:37] So I actually did inspections all the time, but I really couldn't think of a time that
[00:25:42] in my years in command where I did an inspection, this is an inspection, be prepared for that
[00:25:46] inspection.
[00:25:47] And at the same time, everything I did as a leader was an inspection because everything
[00:25:52] I paid attention to was my signal to them of these things that matter.
[00:25:57] I had a safety incident when I was running training.
[00:26:01] There was a safety incident.
[00:26:03] And my boss, I could see you wanted to, what you wanted to bring a little bit of the
[00:26:13] thunder, right?
[00:26:15] And so unannounced inspection of my range, safety officer qualification letters.
[00:26:24] So I'm working at a training command where I've got whatever.
[00:26:28] I got 100 instructors, seal instructors, they're all range safety officers, all 100%.
[00:26:36] And so I've already, you know, paperwork is not my best quality.
[00:26:43] And the inspector shows up.
[00:26:48] And you know, it was like, I remember this, it was a fleet, like a fleet.
[00:26:55] I want to say it was a fleet, lieutenant, and chief.
[00:26:59] So they didn't send seals over because seals would have been like a hedgehog of what
[00:27:04] we're going to be over there in an hour.
[00:27:05] You might want to, you know, little heads up.
[00:27:07] They would have brod me out, right?
[00:27:09] No bro.
[00:27:10] These guys show up.
[00:27:13] And, you know, I get to add man, hey, hey, sir, we have an inspection.
[00:27:19] And I'm like an inspection.
[00:27:21] Okay.
[00:27:22] What do we get in perspective?
[00:27:24] So in comes this chief in the lieutenant.
[00:27:27] We need to check your RSO, your range safety officer qualifications for all your instructors.
[00:27:33] And I'm thinking, okay, in my mind, I'm like, whatever, I don't even know where these
[00:27:38] are.
[00:27:39] Right?
[00:27:40] I'm completely, I'm just, if I was, I want to just
[00:27:43] held out my, you know, get put my hands out to get cuffed, you know, like arrest me now.
[00:27:49] And sure enough, my admin department says, oh, you want to see the, you want to see the
[00:27:55] all the RSO qualifications.
[00:27:56] I make sure that every single person, every single hundred people here that all have
[00:28:00] that all by the way, rotate in at different times, they're all rotate now.
[00:28:04] There's not like any, it's not like a one unified group of people that's all getting
[00:28:08] qualified at the same time.
[00:28:09] No, these are random guys that are coming and going at different times.
[00:28:11] Oh, you want to see if all those hundred people are completely up to date and qualified
[00:28:16] for their range safety officer paperwork?
[00:28:19] Yeah, that's what we want to see.
[00:28:21] Okay, go, come over here.
[00:28:23] My admin team pulls them out and just starts.
[00:28:25] Yeah, oh, yeah, what, oh, you want to look at, you want to look at all hundred, everything
[00:28:28] was one, a hundred percent square to wait.
[00:28:31] 100 percent square to wait.
[00:28:32] I had nothing to do with it.
[00:28:35] I had nothing to do with it.
[00:28:36] Obviously, the guy that was, but had to me before me, had the implemented a system or
[00:28:40] someone at some point in implementing a system and there it was, a hundred percent square
[00:28:44] to wait.
[00:28:47] So that kind of thing, I can take no credit for that, but guess what?
[00:28:51] As I, that's a situation where guess what I should have done when I showed up at that
[00:28:56] command?
[00:28:57] I should have had a good list and you know what's in this book, there's a thing in this
[00:29:01] book that talks about how you turn over with someone think, what do you get ready?
[00:29:06] That's something when I showed up at the command, I should have said, okay, think about
[00:29:09] what this command does.
[00:29:10] Oh, we are range safety officers.
[00:29:13] That's one of our primary duties.
[00:29:15] I should probably make sure that we are up to speed from an administrative perspective,
[00:29:21] which is again, what we already talked about on the last podcast, from an administrative
[00:29:24] perspective.
[00:29:25] Because guess what, if my boss finds out that none of my guys are quality, the quality
[00:29:29] is all over the place, I should not, I'm not qualified to be in that job.
[00:29:34] That's bad.
[00:29:35] My guys, there's a reason for those range safety qualifications.
[00:29:38] I should have had that I should have inspected it.
[00:29:40] So there's an example of, look, I'm glad I got away with it.
[00:29:43] You know, I'm glad that somebody was more square, I'm glad that my own administrative department
[00:29:48] was more square than I was, but I don't like that feeling.
[00:29:52] So something like that, absolutely, I should have, I should have at some point said, hey,
[00:29:56] I'm going to take a look at our administrative records.
[00:29:59] That way, I feel comfortable and confident and also people realize that it is important.
[00:30:03] Because I didn't place it by, by never inspecting it, two things happened.
[00:30:07] One, no one thought it was important.
[00:30:09] And I'm just by the grace of God and good square to wait discipline that they did it.
[00:30:14] And number two, they never got me credit for doing that.
[00:30:17] I never got to go to my admin department and said, hey, I want to look at the records
[00:30:21] and then say, oh, here you go, boss, and me say great job.
[00:30:25] So even though I'm kind of downplaying the use of inspections, when you look at it as
[00:30:30] a positive tool, it's something that I should have used more.
[00:30:35] I had such a negative attitude towards inspections.
[00:30:37] I should have had a more positive attitude towards it and done them more often.
[00:30:42] So I think that is, that is when I'm walking away, my lesson learned is inspections.
[00:30:50] I think of them as a tool for accountability.
[00:30:52] I should think of them as inspections are a tool for complimentary activity with your
[00:30:58] troops, for confirming that the right things are being focused on.
[00:31:02] Because guess what, you know, of the admin department, you know how
[00:31:05] many RSOs, you know, me rain safety officers, they were in the admin department.
[00:31:09] Take a guess.
[00:31:12] Admin guys are RSOs?
[00:31:14] Yes, none.
[00:31:15] Zero.
[00:31:16] Exactly.
[00:31:17] They had no reason to be concerned about that.
[00:31:18] No, I've never made it important.
[00:31:20] I never made it important.
[00:31:21] Thankfully, they were great square to wait.
[00:31:23] Yeah.
[00:31:24] You know, sailors that got it done.
[00:31:26] Yeah.
[00:31:27] Chapter six, a successful manager.
[00:31:35] Advice from a civilian manager.
[00:31:37] When I was, and you know what, this is something that I, I've talked about before, which
[00:31:40] is in the 90s.
[00:31:44] And I don't know if you remember this.
[00:31:45] Maybe you saw it, maybe you didn't.
[00:31:47] In the 90s, there would be a lot of, hey, what can the military learn from, from civilian
[00:31:53] companies?
[00:31:54] There's a lot of like, hey, we want to send you out to IBM or whoever to see how they
[00:31:59] operate.
[00:32:02] And yet a lot of those lessons that the civilian businesses, the lot of the things that
[00:32:08] they did to operate was based on military opportunities, a bunch of guys that got out of World
[00:32:13] War 2 and said, hey, this is what we should do.
[00:32:15] Right?
[00:32:16] That the greatest generation came back and said, I know how to run shit.
[00:32:18] Watch this.
[00:32:20] Yeah.
[00:32:21] So it goes both ways.
[00:32:24] And, and it's something, but then sometimes it's like, oh, the military.
[00:32:27] So the civilians after World War II said, oh, we'll take all these practices from
[00:32:31] the military.
[00:32:32] And then here we were, this book came out 1963.
[00:32:34] Hey, let's make sure that we're learning from the corporate as well.
[00:32:38] So advice from a civilian manager, when I was taking my graduate work in civil engineering
[00:32:43] at Cornell University, the head of a very prominent and successful, general contracting
[00:32:49] firm spoke to us on what made a contractor successful or really what kept him from going
[00:32:54] broke.
[00:32:55] He said that if you went into a new area and wanted to talk about probably the most astute
[00:32:59] individual, there you should seek out a general contractor who has been in business successfully
[00:33:05] for at least 10 years.
[00:33:06] If you analyze his methods of operations, this is what you had find undoubtedly.
[00:33:10] Okay.
[00:33:11] So here's how this, here's how a civilian contractor runs a business.
[00:33:16] He collected and kept to up to date on detailed costs.
[00:33:22] He had his staff available to him as needed, expert advice in the field of engineering
[00:33:28] finance purchasing taxation, law, etc., and he used them.
[00:33:32] So on his staff, he had experts and we needed him and he talked to him.
[00:33:38] He had competent, formant, frontline leaders.
[00:33:42] He took the time to orient and train them.
[00:33:45] His relations with his workforce were good so that his turnover was small and provided
[00:33:49] key personnel with steady work.
[00:33:51] He had good labor relations.
[00:33:54] He obtained good equipment and kept it operating through positive program of inspection,
[00:33:57] maintenance and operator training.
[00:34:00] He understood the problems created by special conditions such as storms, weather, temperature,
[00:34:04] seasons, flood, climate and estimated and planned around them.
[00:34:09] He had a good supervision and inspection setup to ensure quality, prevent delays and to
[00:34:14] overcome quickly unforeseen obstacles and ensure acceptance without costly adjustment or
[00:34:20] doing over.
[00:34:21] His plans always reflected much thought in economical methods of construction and then this
[00:34:28] last section says, but most of all, he was an expert on timing in that he programs, in
[00:34:37] that he programed the method, the flow of the following to the job at proper times and
[00:34:42] proper amounts with proper specifications and proper quality in order that none was
[00:34:47] overlooked, work was not delayed and none arrived too early and too much or too little.
[00:34:53] And then he goes through a big list, cost data, plans, decisions lay out of the area,
[00:34:57] flow charts, supervision setup, inspection.
[00:34:59] He goes on financing, workforce, field offices, field storage, power and light requirements.
[00:35:05] He goes through all this stuff and what he's basically saying is he make a list, make a list
[00:35:11] of what's important.
[00:35:13] And then he takes all that and says applicability to military situation.
[00:35:18] I'm sure you notice the great similarity between the management qualities required in a general
[00:35:23] contractor and those required in the commander of a military operation.
[00:35:30] Steps in command or in managing a job.
[00:35:32] One, based on the mission or orders, the commander determines, isolates and defines the
[00:35:37] limits of the problem.
[00:35:41] And every once in a while, I get something where I go, oh, and this is one of those moments.
[00:35:47] Number two, the commander turns the problem into an operation by issuing a clear and adequate
[00:35:56] directive for the conducting of it and what I really like about that is, and you know we
[00:36:04] hear it, define what the problem is, define what the problem is.
[00:36:08] If you don't know what the problem is, how are you doing anything else?
[00:36:12] And if you think about any mission that we ever did in the military, there's a problem
[00:36:16] that we're trying to solve.
[00:36:18] Any mission that we ever did, there's a problem.
[00:36:20] Hey, there's a bad guy.
[00:36:22] He's killing Americans.
[00:36:25] That's the problem.
[00:36:26] We want to get rid of them.
[00:36:27] Okay, how are we going to solve that problem?
[00:36:30] Here's your operation.
[00:36:33] If the help of the executive, the commander monitors and guides the staff, while it prepares,
[00:36:45] while it prepares, underlined by me.
[00:36:49] Not he prepares, it prepares for issue by him or the staff, coordinate instructions, plans
[00:36:53] and orders for implementing the directive.
[00:36:55] The commander follows up to see the plans, instructions, and orders are fully understood,
[00:36:59] and carried out, making the necessary modifications and additions as the operation progresses
[00:37:04] to accomplishment.
[00:37:05] There you go.
[00:37:08] So I'm over here, kind of, hearing all this for the first time, and I've actually been struggling
[00:37:14] with these last two sections in my brain.
[00:37:16] I'm struggling because I'm thinking about how I led in the Marine Corps, and I'm like,
[00:37:21] I didn't do a lot of these things until you kind of explain that last part.
[00:37:25] I was even thinking about your explanation of the previous chapter of the inspection of your
[00:37:30] range safety program, and you like, hey, I kind of sure to made this a priority, and I'm like,
[00:37:35] man, I'm not here to say, I want to be really careful, like you said, like, what he's saying
[00:37:42] is right, but I honestly don't think I ever inspected anything.
[00:37:47] I really don't think I did that.
[00:37:49] And what I keep coming back to is what he just described in my brain.
[00:37:53] I just keep going to this connection of decentralized command and culture.
[00:37:58] I know I created a culture by which everybody on my team understood that what they did was
[00:38:05] critical.
[00:38:07] And I also knew my people well enough to know what they did.
[00:38:11] And so I had an admin shop too.
[00:38:12] I had a same group of admin Marines, which their job was admin Marines.
[00:38:18] I actually didn't know the 39 things on the admin checklist sets of requirements.
[00:38:24] You know who did?
[00:38:25] My admin chief did.
[00:38:26] And I spent enough time with him to make him know that those things were critical, even
[00:38:31] though I didn't know any of them individually the way he did.
[00:38:35] And I'm thinking, like, how many times did somebody come in and check out my admin shop?
[00:38:38] And I was like, how do we do?
[00:38:39] It's like, sure, what do you mean?
[00:38:41] How do we crush it?
[00:38:42] We're totally good to go.
[00:38:43] We had no hits, no deviations or whatever.
[00:38:48] It wasn't because I ever inspected his shop.
[00:38:50] And I'm running through this thing like, man, I didn't have a checklist for inspection
[00:38:52] of my squadron.
[00:38:54] But my squadron was kind of awesome because the people all knew, hey, hey, Marines, we own
[00:39:00] these things.
[00:39:01] Nobody else in the squadron does these things but us.
[00:39:04] And these things have to be squared away because at some point somebody's going to come
[00:39:07] in.
[00:39:08] So I'm just going to assess somebody's going to measure or evaluate and we owe this to the
[00:39:11] squadron because if we can't do this, it's going to affect this and we're not going to
[00:39:14] fire points.
[00:39:15] And the skipper needs us to fire points.
[00:39:17] And I'm trying to think of a way to say it without disagreeing with what he's saying
[00:39:23] until he got to the end, which was, hey, here's my job as a leader.
[00:39:27] We have a problem.
[00:39:28] We need to solve this problem.
[00:39:29] You know who's going to solve this problem?
[00:39:31] You, I don't know how to, I have no idea to fix that.
[00:39:34] And then when you're done, you're going to come to me and I'm going to go, okay, that
[00:39:37] makes sense.
[00:39:38] Here's what we're going to do to make sure this happens.
[00:39:40] And so that thing is actually pulled the threat of the previous two chapters together.
[00:39:43] I'm over and going, I think I might have sucked as a leader because I'm going
[00:39:47] to do anything.
[00:39:48] I didn't do any of those things he had describing until he pulled it together, which was
[00:39:51] they are the ones that are solving all those problems.
[00:39:55] So it's kind of a relief.
[00:39:56] And I'm not here to say, I'm not here to say, do what I did.
[00:39:59] I'm just kind of almost embarrassed like, yeah, I didn't do any inspections as a squadron
[00:40:03] commander at a time where there was more scrutiny on my command than probably any squadron
[00:40:09] in the, possibly the military because of how high profile it was.
[00:40:13] And I'm thinking, should I've been running around inspecting all my people?
[00:40:17] Well, I'll answer for that for you in my opinion, because it sounds like you and I did the
[00:40:23] exact same freaking thick, right?
[00:40:26] You and I did the exact same freaking thing.
[00:40:28] Now, the reason that I regret that I never inspected my admin departments tracking of
[00:40:37] RS or the reason I regret that there's two reasons.
[00:40:40] Number one, when it came, when that inspection came on announced inspection, I was like,
[00:40:46] fingers are crossed, I have no idea.
[00:40:48] And if I was a Batman, I wouldn't have bet on the wind.
[00:40:53] I wouldn't have bet on the, I wouldn't have bet on zero.
[00:40:57] Yeah, no deviation.
[00:40:58] Zero deviations, which is what we got.
[00:41:00] So I'm, I don't like that.
[00:41:03] But even more important than that is I had people that worked for me that did an exceptional
[00:41:10] job, an exceptional job.
[00:41:13] I never gave them, I mean, look, after the after we got randomly, if they were, if
[00:41:19] that inspection never would have happened, I never would have given them any credit, right?
[00:41:24] I never, so I'm, I, I, I would have gone back in time if I could do it again.
[00:41:30] You know what I do?
[00:41:31] As I go, hey, guys, I'm going to come and check out some of the stuff in admin today.
[00:41:34] Yeah.
[00:41:35] And I want to say, show me these RS, show me these, give me, hey, Smith Jones and white.
[00:41:41] Let me there, RSO records right now.
[00:41:44] They pull them out and I go, man, you guys are on top of things.
[00:41:47] Thank you.
[00:41:48] Thank you.
[00:41:49] And now I'm just that much better.
[00:41:51] So that's why I feel like inspections is a tool, not so much a tool to make sure that
[00:41:56] people are doing, it's a, it's a, it's a connection.
[00:41:59] Yes.
[00:42:00] It's an opportunity to compliment people.
[00:42:01] It's an opportunity for, hey, man, if I never inspect those things, how important is
[00:42:08] it to me?
[00:42:10] Not not, it's not very important, obviously.
[00:42:12] Yeah.
[00:42:13] Guess what, when the, when my commanding officer comes over to inspect, guess how important
[00:42:16] it's number one thing on my free list.
[00:42:18] And I had, I had, I only, here's the next part.
[00:42:24] Pup, pup.
[00:42:28] What trumps above inspections in the hierarchy of leadership is obviously culture.
[00:42:37] So you, at your squadron and, and I'll give you some credit, but I will give free
[00:42:43] can credit to the good old United States Marine Corps, which is you never set a word, but
[00:42:48] those Marines knew this is my job.
[00:42:51] I will be freaking ready.
[00:42:52] This is what I do.
[00:42:53] So there's a culture inside the Marine Corps, which you enhanced inside your squadron
[00:42:58] that everybody knew this is what we do.
[00:43:01] That's what we're looking for.
[00:43:02] That's what we're trying to do.
[00:43:04] Yeah.
[00:43:05] And hopefully we don't have to inspect as a negative, hopefully we inspect
[00:43:08] it in a positive way.
[00:43:09] Yeah.
[00:43:10] And I think that's the genius of what he's saying as I'm thinking about it is that,
[00:43:13] if you hear the word inspection, 99 people out of 100, that's a negative word.
[00:43:17] That's a bad word.
[00:43:18] The inspection is not something you want.
[00:43:21] We don't, I don't want to be inspected.
[00:43:22] There's a negative connotation.
[00:43:24] And the negative connotation is true.
[00:43:26] If the things your people are doing wrong is a reflection of them and the things your
[00:43:29] people doing right is a reflection of you.
[00:43:31] And he's saying the exact opposite.
[00:43:33] The things your people are doing right is a reflection of them and you should tell them
[00:43:36] they're doing awesome.
[00:43:37] And the things they're doing wrong is a reflection of you.
[00:43:40] Yeah.
[00:43:41] And that alone just reversing what it actually means to inspect and the conclusion of that.
[00:43:47] And that I think has been the part I've been wrestling with this whole time listening to it.
[00:43:51] And when what he's saying is exactly opposite of the standard connotation of inspection.
[00:43:58] So anyway, that's pretty cool.
[00:43:59] The sections should be positive, not negative.
[00:44:04] Chapter seven, leadership, commander ship, general ship.
[00:44:15] And then in quotes, follow a ship.
[00:44:19] I can assure you that it's, and so this is addressed to students of the command and general
[00:44:24] staff college, Fort Levenworth, Kansas, 1962 to 1963 course.
[00:44:29] He printed with permission from Armour Magazine.
[00:44:34] Why don't I subscribe?
[00:44:35] Why don't I have a subscription to Armour Magazine?
[00:44:41] Here we go.
[00:44:42] I can assure you that it's a great privilege for me to return to the command and general
[00:44:46] staff college even though this is the first time I have been permitted to be on this platform
[00:44:50] in civilian clothes.
[00:44:51] I've been here over a long period of time from time to time.
[00:44:54] I entered here as a student 24 years ago.
[00:44:56] I've taken great interest in the command and general staff college because I was able to work
[00:45:00] in the field of Army education on several occasions.
[00:45:03] I don't know that there's any institution in America that is so favorably known worldwide
[00:45:09] in military circles as your college.
[00:45:12] And while I can't think of many things that I contributed to the college, I did contribute
[00:45:17] one thing that I think was important.
[00:45:19] You can see he's got a little, little humility.
[00:45:22] I can't think of anything I've done, but it's one thing that I think was important.
[00:45:26] I was responsible for changing the name of it from the command and general staff school
[00:45:33] to the command and general staff college.
[00:45:36] You might think that to be a play in the semantics, but it isn't.
[00:45:43] It's important because after all, you gentlemen here are getting the equivalent of your
[00:45:47] master's degree in your profession.
[00:45:50] I wanted to just talk to you with you this morning.
[00:45:52] I didn't come here to deliver a lecture.
[00:45:54] I came to talk to you about certain aspects of the job that you're learning to do.
[00:45:58] After all, this is the command and general staff college and that name was not arrived
[00:46:02] without some thought.
[00:46:04] And of course, it sets forth your mission for being here.
[00:46:08] I was a troop commander for 13 straight years before I retired.
[00:46:14] And that encompasses the career of a great many people, a great many of you people.
[00:46:20] So that I didn't come here today to play over again the record that I think a lot of you
[00:46:25] have heard me play many times.
[00:46:28] You have heard a very good course at the college and leadership.
[00:46:31] And I assure you that I'll not repeat that or go into the attributes that are required
[00:46:36] in the field of leadership.
[00:46:37] I think they are very well known.
[00:46:38] They're really not very complicated.
[00:46:41] The art of leadership is only complicated to theorists.
[00:46:44] It's not complicated to practical men.
[00:46:47] There are only a few really, a very few simple rules and precepts that build the makeup
[00:46:51] of character that are necessary to be better than a satisfactory leader.
[00:46:56] And I'm sure that each one of you has passed that qualification or else you wouldn't be here.
[00:47:01] I would like to go further into this particular field and point out to you that I believe
[00:47:05] we have become an exact and in exact in the use of terminology because I was reading last
[00:47:13] night a memorandum which said that we teach leadership at the command and general staff college
[00:47:20] from the level of the division commander up.
[00:47:22] I take issue with that statement for the reason that leadership is a peculiar art or a technique
[00:47:29] in itself and a division commander is not basically a leader.
[00:47:36] He is a commander.
[00:47:39] And I'm going to point out to you that you should be adjusting your thinking to a different
[00:47:44] point of view.
[00:47:45] I will talk to you briefly about what I call commander ship and general ship which are quite
[00:47:51] different from being a leader.
[00:47:54] Pretty interesting, right?
[00:47:55] Yeah.
[00:47:56] I this one got my attention man.
[00:47:57] I'm reading this.
[00:47:58] I'm like, ooh wait a second, where are we going?
[00:47:59] Where is he going?
[00:48:00] Where is he going?
[00:48:02] If you will go to the title of the people who you are in charge of in military echelons
[00:48:08] starting at the bottom, you'll first come to a squad leader, then a platoon leader.
[00:48:16] And every other title after that has the word commander.
[00:48:22] So for those of you who don't know, you got a fire team leader, you got a squad leader,
[00:48:28] you got a platoon leader, and then you get to a company commander or even a task unit commander.
[00:48:37] Why was that done?
[00:48:38] There are no company leaders.
[00:48:40] There are no battalion leaders.
[00:48:42] There are only company battalion brigade commanders.
[00:48:45] And then you get to division commanding generals, which is a further progression.
[00:48:49] I'd like to point out to you that I hope you all will graduate with an appreciation of
[00:48:53] the transition that is necessary to go from leadership to commander ship.
[00:48:59] I hope you don't think this old man now is involved in semantics because I hope I'm not.
[00:49:05] It's really an important thing and a lot of people have never bridged it.
[00:49:09] They're still exercising leadership as company commanders or even as they get higher.
[00:49:15] And by doing so, they're bypassing or poorly using their subordinate commanders and staffs.
[00:49:23] Just to take a break.
[00:49:24] So I've talked about this many times.
[00:49:30] There are people that do a great platoon commander.
[00:49:37] Task unit commander is not quite there.
[00:49:39] Seal team commander, they're not good.
[00:49:42] We've worked with businesses where you had this CEO, founder.
[00:49:49] Like this one we see a lot.
[00:49:50] Founder slash CEO.
[00:49:52] Hey, does an amazing job forming that business building that business?
[00:49:56] All of a sudden it's time to really grow.
[00:49:59] They can't make the transition.
[00:50:02] They don't make the transition.
[00:50:04] And they have to bring in a new person to be the CEO, a person with these other attributes.
[00:50:12] So this is something that's, all I was thinking about is, oh, okay.
[00:50:16] I remember the CEO that brought the company, brought this particular company through this
[00:50:20] particular situation and then got to that level and they had to move them into some
[00:50:25] different role and they had to bring in somebody that had this next, this next level of
[00:50:30] leadership characteristics.
[00:50:35] Continuing on, you came here to learn commander ship or general ship and that involves
[00:50:40] the proper organization and utilization of subordinate commanders and staffs to establish
[00:50:45] what you want done with your command.
[00:50:49] And the technique is much different than the technique of getting in front of a platoon
[00:50:53] and saying follow me, which is leadership.
[00:50:59] But when you're in a different position with reference to your soldiers, then you become
[00:51:03] more or less a director and the technique of a director ship is far different than the
[00:51:09] technique of saying follow me.
[00:51:11] I'm so glad he gave a, he broke this down.
[00:51:16] I will give you an illustration.
[00:51:19] Who's you have a horse at a point a that you want to move to point b?
[00:51:27] You take hold of the halter shank and he follows you down the road, you're the leader.
[00:51:33] So there you go.
[00:51:34] Hey, that's what you are.
[00:51:36] You take that bridal and you, lead this thing down the road, you're the leader.
[00:51:40] But if you get on and ride him, you use different techniques, you use different aids,
[00:51:47] you use your legs and other things that I learned in the ancient days when we had writing
[00:51:51] at West Point to accomplish your purpose.
[00:51:54] And I would say that might be termed commander ship.
[00:51:59] You're then the commander of the horse.
[00:52:01] You're not as leader, but the purpose is the same to move him from a to b.
[00:52:08] Now if you're affluent enough to own a sulky and I had to look up sulky, I had no idea
[00:52:14] of sulky as a carriage.
[00:52:16] It can be a one person carriage, but it's two wheels.
[00:52:19] If you're affluent enough to own a sulky and drive him with the reins and with a whip
[00:52:26] in your hand, then that's general ship.
[00:52:29] And I bring that up because it isn't too far fetched in the problem that I would like
[00:52:33] to bring with you.
[00:52:36] I will give you a historical example of a fellow who was tremendous leader during the
[00:52:41] civil war, perhaps one of the greatest leaders of the civil war.
[00:52:44] And I use that term in the sense that I have used it up to now.
[00:52:49] So he's talking about a leader.
[00:52:50] One of the greatest leaders, but he's saying in the term that I'm using a great leader in
[00:52:54] the civil war was Hood, who commanded the Texas Brigade.
[00:52:59] He was a most fantastic troop leader and sometimes if you'd like to look into a further,
[00:53:04] there's a very good book entitled The Galen Hood, Hood was a leader of the old school.
[00:53:11] And front of his men with a saber in his hand, that's how he handled his brigade and it
[00:53:16] was an effective organization.
[00:53:19] It was inevitable that a man with such capabilities would be promoted.
[00:53:22] He went up rapidly throughout the war.
[00:53:24] He ranked next to Lee at the end of the war, but when the war was over, he had lost command.
[00:53:31] It was a sorry ending to a man who had never mastered the transition from leadership to
[00:53:36] commander ship to general ship.
[00:53:40] And you move into the field of commander ship as against the field of leadership, you
[00:53:46] go to the techniques or the arc of how you use your subordinate commanders to get the
[00:53:51] most out of them, the art and the technique of how you organize and use your staff in order
[00:53:57] to enable you to carry out the job of directing, organizing and handling operations.
[00:54:02] So I'm just going to, I'm going to wrap through this whole thing because there's so much
[00:54:11] to talk about.
[00:54:12] And I'm going to let me pause.
[00:54:17] This is what I find interesting.
[00:54:21] And he's going to come back to it, but I'll give you a foreshadowing.
[00:54:24] He's going to come back to it.
[00:54:28] I think that as he looks back at his career, I got to remember this guy joined when
[00:54:34] he was when he was a kid and he was in a world war one and think about how things changed
[00:54:40] by his own admission in between the world war one and world.
[00:54:44] So when he was a world war one and post world war one, he was in his mind this leader,
[00:54:51] right?
[00:54:52] That was going to lead from the front.
[00:54:53] That was going to make things happen.
[00:54:55] Because the nature of war became more dispersed.
[00:55:00] All of a sudden you had to have a little something that we called decentralized command.
[00:55:06] He can't be in front of his unit the whole time.
[00:55:08] And that would be the same.
[00:55:11] And I think as he became more mature and as he got older, hey look, when you took a, well,
[00:55:21] it's kind of hard.
[00:55:22] Well, I talk about this with life.
[00:55:24] People say like, hey, I wish I would have done X, Y and Z when I was the assistant
[00:55:31] platoon commander.
[00:55:33] Lave could write a book about the things he wish it would have changed when he was
[00:55:36] a assistant platoon commander for sure.
[00:55:38] He was fresh out of the fleet, you know, naval academy fleet and now it's on, he's
[00:55:43] an, he's an assiopton.
[00:55:44] Right?
[00:55:45] Do you think that if he went back and did that right now, do you think he would do things
[00:55:51] a little bit differently?
[00:55:54] Absolutely.
[00:55:55] We all would.
[00:55:56] Yeah.
[00:55:57] We all would do that.
[00:55:58] And so here we have a guy that went through the entire rank structure of the army, the
[00:56:04] entire thing.
[00:56:07] And as he got older and got better and got more experienced, I would think he'd say, this
[00:56:16] is what I should have done when I was a platoon commander, but I didn't.
[00:56:20] And here's what I would do differently.
[00:56:22] But maybe because the wars were different and it was more centralized and it wasn't dispersed,
[00:56:27] everyone was together.
[00:56:28] So there's a, there's a, I think what I see is him is him saying listen, it was, it's
[00:56:36] a different thing, whereas I look at it now and say wait a second, it might have been a
[00:56:40] different thing for you.
[00:56:42] But if you could go back knowing what you learned eventually, you might say, hey, I actually
[00:56:48] would have led differently.
[00:56:51] Now tell you right now, even in a platoon, even in a freaking squad, even in a fire team.
[00:56:59] The techniques that he's going to talk about, what's better, if you're in charge of a
[00:57:05] platoon, what's better, grab in the grabbing the reins and pulling them down, or is it better
[00:57:11] to guide them and let them run?
[00:57:15] Yeah.
[00:57:16] The answer is so obvious.
[00:57:18] But he digs in a little bit, chain responsibility.
[00:57:25] And also you must realize, as you go up in various echelons of organization of the army,
[00:57:30] from the squad on up, you become increasingly removed from the individual soldiers and
[00:57:34] your influence on the individual soldier is no longer carried by an eyeball to eyeball approach.
[00:57:38] It is carried on through the echelons of your command down to him and you become increasingly
[00:57:44] just an image to him, which you develop in several ways, but you get to the field of proper
[00:57:52] staff organization and staff relationship because that is very important, part of command
[00:57:56] or ship and general ship.
[00:57:57] What is that saying?
[00:57:58] What it's saying is when you're in a leadership position, as you go up in ranks, you
[00:58:03] right, you don't have eyeball to eyeball at any all the time.
[00:58:06] Guess who you do have eyeball to eyeball with?
[00:58:09] You're a subordinate leader.
[00:58:10] And your subordinate leaders have to nurture those close personal relationships with their
[00:58:15] troops, so that that influence that you have as the commander is felt all the way down
[00:58:20] through the front lines.
[00:58:24] Back to the book.
[00:58:25] In your recent military review, there's an article on faulty staff relationships.
[00:58:29] I hope it will cause you to give a little thought to that problem because it is important
[00:58:33] one.
[00:58:34] You come to one of the most important parts of commander ship and leadership, and that is establishing
[00:58:38] a chain of responsibility.
[00:58:40] So that every man in your organization knows who he works for and who works for him.
[00:58:46] That's cool.
[00:58:47] I get that.
[00:58:48] Wait, that's called a chain of command.
[00:58:51] That is basic.
[00:58:53] How many organizations have you been in where that wasn't known?
[00:58:58] I've been in several.
[00:58:59] I had no idea who I worked for or who out who or who made out my efficiency report.
[00:59:06] After all, and this is one of those things where I get a little cringy.
[00:59:10] As my kids, as my daughters would say, after all, there's one basic rule in the army that
[00:59:15] you can't violate.
[00:59:17] And I over a period of 44 years have tried to violate many of them.
[00:59:21] I've been successful in a few, but this one I have never been successful in.
[00:59:25] And that is you work and devote your loyalty to the man who makes out your efficiency
[00:59:31] report and the man who endorses it.
[00:59:35] If you don't do that, you're never going to be a general.
[00:59:38] So to me, this is wrong.
[00:59:45] To me, relationships are stronger than the chain of command.
[00:59:50] And luckily he's going to counter this.
[00:59:51] He's going to counter this.
[00:59:52] He's going to counter this.
[00:59:53] Of course.
[00:59:54] The establishing a chain of responsibility is just as important.
[01:00:02] And look, this is proven out by hack worth who built these incredible relationships and
[01:00:06] that's how we ran things.
[01:00:08] Establishing a chain of responsibilities just as important in your staff as it is in your
[01:00:11] command.
[01:00:12] If you don't have that, your headquarters mills around and creates what I call command and
[01:00:17] staff inertia.
[01:00:19] That is a state of frustration and lack of purpose that exists in many military staffs.
[01:00:24] Okay.
[01:00:25] People got to know what people got to know with the chain of command.
[01:00:27] For sure.
[01:00:29] Then of course, it comes down to the art of command or ship or general ship as to how you
[01:00:34] issue your directives or how you project your desires and will down through the chain of
[01:00:39] command.
[01:00:40] Oh, desire, I read that wrong.
[01:00:43] As to how you issue your directives or how you project your desires and will down through
[01:00:48] the chain of command, it comes out in directives and so forth, which is an art within itself.
[01:00:54] And which I am sorry to say, we sometimes don't do very well.
[01:00:57] We could do a lot better when we're doing that in the field.
[01:01:02] I've worked at times for a commander for whom I felt I wasn't doing a good job because
[01:01:07] the truth of the matter was I didn't know what he wanted me to accomplish.
[01:01:12] Okay.
[01:01:14] Second law of combat, simple, simple clear and concise.
[01:01:19] If I don't know what you want me to do, there's no way I can accomplish it.
[01:01:21] And by the way, who's fault is that?
[01:01:23] It's my fault.
[01:01:24] If I don't know what my boss wants me to accomplish, what do I do?
[01:01:27] I raise my hand and ask my boss, what do you want me to accomplish?
[01:01:30] What's the mission here?
[01:01:31] Get done.
[01:01:32] What's the end date?
[01:01:33] What's your intent?
[01:01:37] Next section, improving your unit.
[01:01:39] Now we get to the point of making progress as a commander.
[01:01:41] I can't conceive of anybody who takes over a company, a batallion, a brigade or division,
[01:01:46] a corps, a field army who doesn't sit down and say to himself, how I impress upon my
[01:01:50] superiors, the men who make out my efficiency report that I am a good commander.
[01:01:57] Once again, you know, you get a little bit of that.
[01:02:00] I'm looking to get promoted, which I don't like.
[01:02:05] How do I do that?
[01:02:06] I've seen it done every way that you can think of in my career, but I would suggest to
[01:02:10] you that the best way to do it in the military organization is through a little exercise
[01:02:15] of what I call, is through the exercise of what I call little pluses of making a little
[01:02:22] progress in every field every day.
[01:02:25] Over a period of time, if you do that, your organization will tighten up.
[01:02:29] Your organization will become good and you'll gradually come up with the understanding and
[01:02:33] the reputation of really being a good commander.
[01:02:38] You will also not create turbulence, which detracts from the effectiveness of your unit.
[01:02:44] So I like this idea, little things, get a little bit better every day.
[01:02:48] But then he goes into this without that thing when he talks about turbulence, he goes
[01:02:51] into it.
[01:02:52] I've seen people walk into an organization and immediately start to make headlines.
[01:02:58] I would like to point out to you a great truth in the military that he who lives by headlines
[01:03:06] is destroyed by headlines.
[01:03:09] Remember that if you start seeking headlines and creating images of yourself as a Superman,
[01:03:14] pretty soon somebody will find a hole in your armor and when he does he will certainly
[01:03:18] give it to you.
[01:03:20] That follows from the rule about the monkey who climbs up a pole.
[01:03:24] The high re-gits, the more of his rear he shows the people who are below him and that
[01:03:29] often goes for a person who up the chain of command in the echelons of the army.
[01:03:35] So good, that's what I totally agree with that.
[01:03:41] Now he gets into this section.
[01:03:42] It's called channels of suggestion.
[01:03:47] I hope that I have impressed upon you that there is a technique and commander ship and
[01:03:51] general ship, techniques that are different from leadership, although the characteristics
[01:03:56] of the individual as to honesty and sincerity and all those other things are just as applicable.
[01:04:04] So honesty is important.
[01:04:06] Since you have to master the transition as you go up, there is a little depth of different
[01:04:15] technique being a company commander, the not a being a batagon commander.
[01:04:20] You have a bigger staff, you have more senior subordinate commanders as you go up and that
[01:04:24] of course increases.
[01:04:26] We talk about chain of command.
[01:04:28] I have conscientiously tried throughout my career to live and conduct my job in such
[01:04:34] a way that I didn't exercise control of my organization through channels of command.
[01:04:42] I exercised it through channels of suggestion.
[01:04:46] So instead of using the chain of command, he's saying exactly what we say instead of saying,
[01:04:51] look, I'm in charge, I'm the highest rank guy, you're going to do what I say.
[01:04:55] He's saying don't do that.
[01:04:57] As much as I can throughout my career, I've exercised command through channels of suggestion.
[01:05:06] And I have a note here that says, ha, relationships.
[01:05:11] I think it is very important that I only use the channels of command when I wanted to
[01:05:16] discipline somebody.
[01:05:18] And I didn't have to do that very often.
[01:05:22] I figured that if I could, he's just putting himself on report.
[01:05:25] I figured that if I couldn't run an organization by getting things done by suggestion
[01:05:29] that I'd failed as a commander, I commanded the troops of 12 nations as a core commander
[01:05:34] in Korea.
[01:05:35] I didn't have any strong chain of command between me and the allied troops.
[01:05:39] If I put out something that I want to done that violated their national ideas, they didn't
[01:05:43] pay very much attention to it.
[01:05:45] In that case, what are you going to do next?
[01:05:47] Well, guess what?
[01:05:48] You don't have to be a foreign army for that to make sense.
[01:05:50] That happens in a freaking poll tune.
[01:05:51] That happens in a fire team.
[01:05:53] If I come up with dumb ideas that don't make any sense, that are what does he say?
[01:05:57] That violates their ideas.
[01:06:00] And they don't want to do it.
[01:06:01] Oh, you can force them to do it.
[01:06:02] But what does that get you?
[01:06:06] I was down at the infantry school and commented on this not very long ago.
[01:06:10] And one captain got up and said, General, I've listened to very carefully to your channel
[01:06:16] of suggestion approach.
[01:06:18] And I'm familiar with it.
[01:06:19] I served in your command in Europe.
[01:06:22] And I think you have to be a very powerful, suggestor to make it work.
[01:06:29] Maybe that's true, he says.
[01:06:32] And the note I have here is, here's a good way to suggest.
[01:06:38] Here's the most powerful way to suggest.
[01:06:41] Listen to your other, when this whole time I'm thinking, is it his suggestions or other
[01:06:46] people's suggestions?
[01:06:47] I was thinking he was talking the power of suggestions.
[01:06:50] Hey, Jocca, what do you think we should do here?
[01:06:52] Here's the power of suggestion.
[01:06:55] Hey, Dave, what do you suggest?
[01:06:57] Yes.
[01:06:58] Because I'm going to listen to it.
[01:07:01] And we're probably going to do it.
[01:07:03] I mean, unless it's just a travesty of a plan, we're going to do it.
[01:07:07] So definitely some things to think about in there.
[01:07:13] And as I look at this, look, guess what?
[01:07:17] What's that saying?
[01:07:18] We stand on the shoulders of giants.
[01:07:20] This guy had to do his whole military.
[01:07:21] We get to lead.
[01:07:22] We get to take what he puts out.
[01:07:24] This power of suggestion, which hack worth then took even further.
[01:07:28] And now we got to take that and go even deeper.
[01:07:32] Not even deeper, but further we got to expand that idea of decentralized command.
[01:07:37] And of listening to what people have to say.
[01:07:41] And the fact that hack worth freaking loved his draftes because his draftes would call
[01:07:46] bullshit on him.
[01:07:47] He says that in the book.
[01:07:49] My draftes, they would call bullshit if they didn't agree with something.
[01:07:53] So I loved them for it.
[01:07:54] Not I hated them for it.
[01:07:55] Not shut up and do what I told you to do.
[01:07:57] Thank you.
[01:07:59] Thank you for your suggestion that my idea is stupid.
[01:08:03] What do you suggest?
[01:08:07] He continues to kind of dismantle some of these earlier statements.
[01:08:10] This section is called followership.
[01:08:12] I want to get from there now to another subject and I'll end up and then I'll end up
[01:08:17] my presentation.
[01:08:18] That is the topic that fits right along with leadership.
[01:08:22] What I call followership.
[01:08:24] Everybody is a leader or a commander of any echelon is also a follower.
[01:08:29] You're never, you never get in the hierarchy of the army to a point where you're not
[01:08:32] a follower.
[01:08:34] The chief of staff of army is a follower.
[01:08:37] He follows the desires of the directors of the president, secretary of the army, secretary
[01:08:42] defense, the joint chiefs of staff and so forth.
[01:08:44] Even the president of the United States is a follower in that he follows public opinion.
[01:08:49] What you are today, each one of you is the result of 35 to 40 years of following where
[01:08:54] by you have taken into your makeup ideas, instruction, and concepts and through a process
[01:09:00] of discernment, acceptance and elimination, you have stored away in your makeup certain
[01:09:04] characteristics, ideas and procedures that end you have discarded others.
[01:09:08] In that process of sifting through the good from the poor or what you consider the good
[01:09:13] from the poor, you have created as of today your present makeup and character, which is
[01:09:19] you as an individual.
[01:09:23] If you have attained good characteristics and a storm of good ideas, learning and concepts
[01:09:29] that you can use effectively in the future, you have been a good follower.
[01:09:33] If you haven't, you'll not be a good leader nor a good commander.
[01:09:37] It follows from that that you must through this process of discernment and storing away,
[01:09:43] create in yourself a balanced man whereby you can handle concurrently all the different parts
[01:09:50] of the job.
[01:09:52] You don't concentrate on wanting to forget the other, such as maintenance.
[01:09:55] You don't concentrate on marksmanship and forget something else.
[01:09:58] The best organizations in the American Army are the organizations that are good or better
[01:10:04] in everything.
[01:10:07] They may not make any headlines.
[01:10:09] They may not be superior in any one thing, but they are our best organizations.
[01:10:15] These are the type of organizations that we want to develop in the Army.
[01:10:19] I've tried to, so that idea of making headlines is a great point.
[01:10:26] This idea here reminds me of the gray man, they used to say going through buds, they
[01:10:29] would say if you were the gray man, like if you don't want to be the number one swimmer.
[01:10:32] Because in people who be watching you, you want to kind of like fit in.
[01:10:39] I have tried to lead your thinking through the transition from leadership to commander
[01:10:43] ship and general ship and to point out to you where in follow-up ship is very important
[01:10:48] in this process of your development.
[01:10:53] This next section is progressing up the pyramid of life.
[01:10:56] So all of a sudden this just turns into like a life gig.
[01:11:00] And when I was saying that the end of this section that we're going to cover gets, gets
[01:11:07] really important, this is sort of where I'm starting.
[01:11:10] It has been truthfully said that at the end when one looks back on his life, he should
[01:11:14] measure his success by the number of wrongs up the ladder of life he has climbed since
[01:11:18] he started and not by the particular wrong on which he has finished.
[01:11:22] The basic concept of our government under the Constitution is that all men are created equal.
[01:11:31] All men are created equal.
[01:11:33] This means not that all men are created equal for they are far from it.
[01:11:41] It only means that all men should have equal opportunities and rights under our laws.
[01:11:48] This concept is a great step in the progress of man.
[01:11:54] When any group of men such as army officers, lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists, clerks
[01:12:00] or accountants start out in any corporation or any other organization they fit into a pyramid,
[01:12:07] which is brought at the base but becomes smaller and smaller as they approach its peak,
[01:12:11] assuming that those people in each category start with approximately equal backgrounds.
[01:12:18] There is a selection process which starts as soon as they rise in the pyramid of life,
[01:12:24] as soon as they tend to rise in the pyramid of life.
[01:12:26] We're talking about this hierarchy, which obviously this might bring some thoughts of Jordan
[01:12:33] Peterson and hierarchy of competence and that's kind of what we're talking about here.
[01:12:40] Assuming that, and by the way, he's making, he says, assuming that people start in the
[01:12:44] same approximate backgrounds.
[01:12:46] That's a big freaking assumption.
[01:12:48] But don't worry, he's going to get back on that.
[01:12:51] But that's a huge assumption.
[01:12:52] It's probably an assumption that they didn't recognize as much back in 1950.
[01:13:01] Also assuming that the selection of those who rise in the pyramid of life is based upon
[01:13:05] ability, experience, and the need for special capabilities and leadership, how does one
[01:13:10] prepare himself for being chosen to advance in competition with his associates and colleagues?
[01:13:16] So he's talking about how do you go up that pyramid?
[01:13:19] How do you ascend the dominance hierarchy?
[01:13:26] Everybody who is a leader, director, or commander at any echelon of an organization is also
[01:13:32] a follower.
[01:13:34] He never gets to a point where he is not.
[01:13:36] And he goes to he repeats himself here.
[01:13:38] The Chief of Staff of the Army is a follower.
[01:13:39] He follows the desires of the director of the president, the secretary of the Army, even
[01:13:43] the president is the United States of the United States of the following that he follows
[01:13:46] public opinion.
[01:13:48] What each one of us is today is the result of years of following.
[01:13:53] whereby we have taken into our make-up knowledge, ideas, instruction, and concepts.
[01:13:58] Through a process of discernment, acceptance, and elimination, we have stored away in our
[01:14:02] personal ability, certain characteristics, ideas, and procedures, and we have discarded others
[01:14:08] as nothing worthy.
[01:14:09] So he repeats that section right there.
[01:14:11] He's making it, he's trying to re-emphasize that point.
[01:14:14] And the process of sifting the good from the poor, or what we consider the good from
[01:14:19] the poor, we have created as of today, our president make-up and a character which is
[01:14:23] ours as individuals.
[01:14:25] If we have attained good, correct characteristics, and a store-room of good ideas, learning
[01:14:30] techniques and concepts that we can use effectively in the future, we have been good followers.
[01:14:35] And it was nice to compare this to you know, you and I covered the Marine Corps document
[01:14:42] learning.
[01:14:45] And really when he's talking about following, what he's really talking about is learning.
[01:14:50] Hey, just said, you got to, if you can take that and apply it, then you've been a good
[01:14:54] follower.
[01:14:55] Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:57] We have a good basis for being successful leaders and in all probability we will advance.
[01:15:03] A good follower is able to react quickly and effectively to an emergency or a crisis
[01:15:08] hence he has the potential to become a fine military commander.
[01:15:13] This process must be continuous during our active careers if we are to continue to grow
[01:15:18] in judgment and balance.
[01:15:19] Again, this is the mind's me that Marine Corps like you are learning.
[01:15:23] That's what we're doing.
[01:15:24] And I have a note here that says that this section that I'm about to read is the own
[01:15:30] of his whole thing starts to come together for me.
[01:15:34] Some call this experience, but it is more than that.
[01:15:37] It is the constant and critically sound evaluation of experience that causes us to progress
[01:15:46] in stature and move up the pyramid of life.
[01:15:49] So it's not just about experience.
[01:15:53] Experience by itself barely even helps you.
[01:15:57] What you have to do is you have to take that experience and you have to constant and
[01:16:01] critically evaluate it.
[01:16:06] And that's what will make you progress.
[01:16:08] So you can just go through life and experience all kinds of crazy things and leadership
[01:16:14] challenges.
[01:16:15] But if you never critically assess what you did, what you learned, how you performed, you
[01:16:20] were not talking during the break.
[01:16:23] You said something like, I can't believe that I just didn't get issued this book as a second
[01:16:29] lieutenant when I graduated from the basic school or whatever.
[01:16:34] And we had a quick conversation about the fact that it's one thing to pick up a book and
[01:16:41] read it.
[01:16:42] It's another thing to have a actual conversation and have context and have thoughts around
[01:16:53] the book.
[01:16:54] And I think that's probably one of the reasons why people listen to the podcast is because
[01:16:57] not because I'm sitting here doing an audio book.
[01:16:59] Right?
[01:17:00] I mean, this isn't an audio book of this book.
[01:17:04] This is my thoughts, your thoughts and general Clarks thoughts.
[01:17:09] And sometimes we're right.
[01:17:10] Sometimes we're wrong, sometimes we agree, sometimes we disagree.
[01:17:13] But what we are doing when we do that is we're constantly critically evaluating the experience
[01:17:18] that he had.
[01:17:19] And then we're constantly, we just, you and I just did a freaking 30 minute evaluation
[01:17:23] of the fact that we inspected our admins are not.
[01:17:26] And lessons were learned.
[01:17:31] So that's what we're doing.
[01:17:34] This idea of learning all the time.
[01:17:36] And the more important man, the idea of what look we talk about all the time at echelon
[01:17:41] front, you got to do a debrief.
[01:17:43] You got to do a debrief.
[01:17:44] You have to do a debrief and you get done with the operation.
[01:17:45] When are lose, you got to do a debrief?
[01:17:46] That's what you have to do.
[01:17:51] Then you got to enter early in life as some members of society fall.
[01:17:56] And this is where we just started getting into this broad conversation.
[01:17:59] And this is sort of the last section here.
[01:18:03] Early in life, some members of society fall into limited categories due to handicaps of
[01:18:09] opportunities, health and physical and mental ability.
[01:18:15] These people start life with ceilings over them that few are able to pierce.
[01:18:22] So there's certain situations that you can be born into that are going to be challenging
[01:18:26] and they're really hard to get through.
[01:18:33] And he gets that.
[01:18:36] And then he goes on to say, but how about those whose opportunities, education and
[01:18:43] apparent ability, seem to start off on common equal footing as they begin to move up the
[01:18:50] pyramid of life?
[01:18:54] Each one eventually reaches his own peak and levels off at various distances from the
[01:19:00] top.
[01:19:03] Very few have an apparent ceiling over them at the start, but they develop ceilings at
[01:19:12] various levels as they go along.
[01:19:16] So now we're talking about this pyramid.
[01:19:18] We got this pyramid that we're trying to climb up.
[01:19:21] And some people are, they have a legitimate ceiling in life.
[01:19:25] Whatever they were born, they've got some situation that is a ceiling that they're
[01:19:32] going to reach.
[01:19:34] And it can be very hard to break through that.
[01:19:36] But now we're talking about, hey, look, now you've got people that there's no real ceiling.
[01:19:41] He's on equal footing.
[01:19:44] And then he says, each one eventually reaches his own peak and levels off at various
[01:19:48] distances from the top.
[01:19:51] Very few have an apparent ceiling over them at the start, but they develop ceilings at
[01:19:56] various levels as they go along.
[01:19:58] What causes this leveling off process on the part of an individual?
[01:20:04] What factors tend to cause this ceiling to form over him?
[01:20:10] And then he's got this list.
[01:20:12] He's got this list of factors that cause you to reach your limitation, that cause people
[01:20:19] to reach their limitations.
[01:20:22] Here they are.
[01:20:24] Wrong decisions.
[01:20:28] Wasted opportunities.
[01:20:32] The duration of attitude and enthusiasm, excesses lack of self-control, lack of honesty
[01:20:44] of purpose, tendency toward lowered standards, poor ethics, loss of self-respect, loss
[01:21:01] of motivation and ambition, lack of ability to express himself orally or in writing, poor associations,
[01:21:14] wrong scale of values, failure in carrying out responsibility, lack of loyalty, upper down
[01:21:25] unfortunate family situations, deterioration of physical condition, bad habits, poor financial
[01:21:34] management, disregard of rules, procrastination, failure to keep up with progress in his
[01:21:42] field.
[01:21:46] So what's amazing about that list?
[01:21:51] Let's see.
[01:21:52] I don't know how many there are.
[01:21:54] There's maybe one lack of ability to express himself orally in writing.
[01:21:59] So that is, can you get better at that?
[01:22:00] Yes, you can.
[01:22:01] But there are some people that don't have the same capability.
[01:22:04] Look, wrong decisions.
[01:22:05] Who's that on?
[01:22:07] You.
[01:22:08] Wasted opportunities.
[01:22:09] Detiration of attitude and enthusiasm.
[01:22:11] You.
[01:22:12] Excesses and lack of self-control.
[01:22:14] You.
[01:22:15] Lack of honesty and lack of purpose.
[01:22:16] You.
[01:22:17] Tendency toward lowered standards.
[01:22:19] You.
[01:22:20] Poor ethics.
[01:22:21] You.
[01:22:22] Loss of motivation and ambition.
[01:22:24] Lack of ability to express himself orally in writing.
[01:22:26] Okay, we can improve it, but you may have a limited there.
[01:22:30] Poor associations.
[01:22:32] You.
[01:22:33] Wrong scale of values.
[01:22:34] You.
[01:22:35] Failure in carrying out responsibility.
[01:22:37] You.
[01:22:38] Lack of loyalty up or down.
[01:22:40] You.
[01:22:41] Unfortunately, family situations.
[01:22:43] That's something we don't always have control over.
[01:22:47] Detiration of physical condition.
[01:22:49] That's something that we don't always have control over.
[01:22:51] It's something that we also do have control over, depending on what that deterioration is being
[01:22:55] caused by.
[01:22:56] If you have some kind of a disease that you can't control, look, that's one of those things.
[01:23:01] But oftentimes, there's things that we can do to make sure we maintain our physical
[01:23:04] condition.
[01:23:07] Bad habits.
[01:23:08] That's you.
[01:23:10] Poor financial management.
[01:23:11] That's you.
[01:23:13] This regard to the rules.
[01:23:14] That's you.
[01:23:16] Your procrastination, that's you, failure to keep up with progress in his field, that is you.
[01:23:24] So that is, as a lot of stuff, too, that we can take ownership of.
[01:23:33] Now this whole section closes out with this following statement here.
[01:23:39] Poor, poor fellowship.
[01:23:42] And I think that's supposed to say, follow our ship.
[01:23:45] The follow our ship is a great contributor to ceiling formation.
[01:23:53] And again, the way he's using follow our ship to me is he's talking about, you know,
[01:23:58] the ability to learn, the ability to take ownership of what's happening.
[01:24:03] Once a ceiling is formed or start to form, form is difficult to break through, a few
[01:24:07] do break through despite handicaps.
[01:24:10] However, there are those who would try to dispel these ceilings by social laws and values,
[01:24:17] meaning they want to blame other people.
[01:24:20] To be sure, they are partially successful on the lower reaches of the pyramid of life,
[01:24:26] but not as they reach the apex of the pyramid.
[01:24:28] They only warp the shape of the pyramid at certain levels.
[01:24:34] The Bible says that many are called, but few are chosen.
[01:24:39] It is ever thus as we tried to progress up the pyramid or ladder of life.
[01:24:52] Yeah.
[01:24:53] So with that, probably a good place to stop this one, that's just such an important way
[01:25:03] to look at things.
[01:25:05] And we always talk about extreme ownership from a leadership perspective and leading
[01:25:11] organizations and leading teams, but extreme ownership is about you, it's about your life,
[01:25:17] it's about what you're doing.
[01:25:20] And we have a lot more ownership over what we do and where we end up and where we end
[01:25:25] up in this ladder, in this pyramid, then some people would have you believe.
[01:25:35] That's almost sort of seems like a haphazard list, like almost they're not related
[01:25:41] to those things he was running through.
[01:25:44] And then the common thread is he basically just captured almost all those things are things
[01:25:50] that we impose upon ourselves, which in some sense is like it's kind of crazy because
[01:25:58] as I dissect what he's saying and like, well, how much control do I have over that?
[01:26:03] And for almost all of them, it's 100%.
[01:26:07] Not like, hey, there are components and I think you actually did a good job because, yeah,
[01:26:12] you know what, life happens and you say this on the podcast, other times life happens.
[01:26:17] And sometimes those things in life that happen most certainly limit what we can do.
[01:26:20] It's the fact that those things do happen.
[01:26:24] And even inside of the thread of all those is when he said, wasted opportunities.
[01:26:32] I mean, you want to talk about someone who's taken stock of his life that's actually
[01:26:36] kind of achieved inside this pyramid that he's talking about.
[01:26:39] He's at the top of this pyramid.
[01:26:42] Man, that is a humbling series of things that he's calculated really about himself.
[01:26:49] Number one, wrong decision.
[01:26:51] Number two, waste opportunities.
[01:26:54] Yeah, I mean, there's some startling things inside there and properly, probably for
[01:27:01] me what he did.
[01:27:03] Yes, again, I struggled this section a lot more than the last one because there's part of like,
[01:27:08] where is he going when this stuff?
[01:27:10] Why is he even saying that?
[01:27:12] And when he kind of brings a full back, the thing that he did is this is a guy that
[01:27:16] contemplated the things that he has done and why he did them and dissected the mistakes that
[01:27:22] he's made.
[01:27:24] I mean, if there's a mistake that I made throughout my career was not spending enough time
[01:27:29] dissecting why I did the things that I did.
[01:27:34] And that is a, that is a self-imposed limitation that if you don't think about why the
[01:27:42] meaning, if you don't learn from the things that you did and why you did them,
[01:27:46] that is a self-imposed limitation.
[01:27:48] And God, that list is, that is a humbling list of things to think about.
[01:27:52] Yeah, it's a, it's a heavy hitter.
[01:27:55] Dude, it's a heavy hitter.
[01:27:57] Wrong decisions. Number one.
[01:28:00] But even then, like, there's, there's an ego thing of like, well, yeah, I mean, you know,
[01:28:05] people make people make wrong. I mean, you don't have a decision is right?
[01:28:09] Well, pull that back a little bit.
[01:28:11] Who's that on?
[01:28:14] The mistakes that you made. Who's fault is that?
[01:28:18] It's not not yours that I am at a bad call over here.
[01:28:21] Um, so yeah, I mean, I was struggling at the beginning of each of those parts of like,
[01:28:28] where how is he going to pull this back? And it reminds me of something that you and
[01:28:31] Lave reminded each other about was when we were talking to Tom Fife.
[01:28:35] And I'm sitting here listening to him and he says something and I'm like, man, that didn't
[01:28:38] seem like you were, why did you say that, man? That's not what you're going to say.
[01:28:42] And then he pulls that back full circle of like how clean he made that at the end when in the
[01:28:50] beginning, I'm thinking, where are we going here?
[01:28:52] Yeah, that was like a four minute evolution where I was we were, we were, I don't know,
[01:28:59] probably a third of the way into a really well, it's going to be a long podcast and I think,
[01:29:03] oh, well, I guess his leadership principles don't really mess up with mine. And that's real
[01:29:09] bummer because he's saying, hey, you tell people what to do and they just do it because they've
[01:29:12] been trained that way. And that's okay, you know, they just, they're just so beating because they're
[01:29:16] in the army and for three minutes, I sat there and thought, dang, I guess this isn't. And then
[01:29:23] after three minutes he goes, but these guys would never do what you told him to do just because
[01:29:28] you told him to do it. Yeah, you they need to understand why they were telling us like, yes, totally.
[01:29:32] Thankfully, thankfully. And I think that's the kind of the transition that you see,
[01:29:38] you know, someone like General Clark making towards the end of his careers,
[01:29:41] look, hey, this is General ship, you want to lead by suggest new one after barc orders of people.
[01:29:44] If they're not taking initiative, making things happen, you're doing something wrong.
[01:29:47] That applies. I'm telling you that applies to a platoon, it applies to a squad, it applies to a
[01:29:54] business, it applies to a big business and it applies to a nine person business. It's all the same.
[01:30:02] And how, how comforting is it? How, how good is it to think, oh, I have control over all these things.
[01:30:10] That is actually completely awesome. All these problems in my life. All these things that they're
[01:30:19] all self-imposed, which means I actually have control over all of them. Yeah, I don't know, once again,
[01:30:23] that's the cool premise of extreme ownership. And it's cool when you apply it to your organization.
[01:30:28] Could you say, hey, this is, this is on me. I'm going to make these changes for our company,
[01:30:33] for our team, so we do better. But man, the way it hits you is a human. When you look at all these
[01:30:39] problems that you have and you go, oh, this problem is assailing me. This problem is attacking me.
[01:30:44] This problem is going to destroy me. You say, oh, wait, you know what? I'm going to take ownership
[01:30:51] of those problems. I'm going to get those things sorted out. And look, are there some outliers? Sure.
[01:30:55] There are. There are. Can you get, can you get a horrible disease? Can things that are
[01:31:00] completely beyond your control hit you? Yes, they can. Of course, of course. And, and, you know,
[01:31:08] those, then it turns into, okay, how are you going to respond to those things that are out beyond your control?
[01:31:14] But so many things that we face are just straight on us, wrong decisions,
[01:31:25] waste an opportunity, lack of self respect, very seldom does the ceiling come from others.
[01:31:34] Very seldom does the ceiling come from other most of the time. The vast majority of the time,
[01:31:41] the limitations in our life are exactly that they are our limitations that we imposed on ourselves.
[01:31:52] So I think that's a good connection that he makes, but even though this book is about leading others,
[01:31:56] we cannot lead others if we can't lead ourselves. And if we can't do the right things ourselves,
[01:32:07] then we have no one else to blame. But us.
[01:32:14] All right, good place, good place to stop for now. And I think speaking of
[01:32:20] bad habits, right, we can have some bad habits. Well, we also want to have some good habits.
[01:32:27] We want to speak in a lack of self control. We want to have self control. Speaking of bad decisions,
[01:32:33] we want to make good decisions. Let's think of some ways to get us on the right path for all these things.
[01:32:40] We had Jaco Fiel, which is a bunch of supplements, joint warfare,

[01:38:25] us on the in-a-web's on Twitter, on Instagram, which echo likes to call the gram.
[01:38:31] Anon Facebook. Dave is at David R. Burke, and I am at
[01:38:36] Jaco Willink and thanks. Once again to General Bruce Clark and to Colonel David Hackworth
[01:38:41] for your service to America and for continuing to take care of the troops through the lessons
[01:38:47] you passed on. Thanks to the military personnel out there right now, hold the line.
[01:38:53] Thank you for doing what you do every day to keep us safe and to the police and law enforcement
[01:38:57] firefighters and paramedics and EMT's dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret
[01:39:02] service and all the other first responders. Thank you for holding the line here at home
[01:39:06] and to everyone else out there. Remember these lessons from General Clark. Remember that the
[01:39:11] ceiling you can't break through. Remember that there's a pretty good chance that you built it.
[01:39:21] You made the wrong decisions wasted opportunities to tear your
[01:39:24] nation of attitude lowering standards, poor ethics, poor associations, procrastination,
[01:39:31] and bad habits that list goes on and on and on and the list is on you. The list is on me.
[01:39:41] We control so much of our fate. We control so much of our destiny.
[01:39:49] There may be those little fractions of things that we don't truly control.
[01:39:53] Maybe that's what causes us to just give up on the rest. But I'm telling you don't do that.
[01:39:59] Don't give up on it, own it, own it, all and break through that ceiling.
[01:40:08] And become what you want to become and become who you are supposed to become and you do that
[01:40:17] by going out there every day and getting after it.
[01:40:22] So until next time, this is Dave and Joko out.
