00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.60
This is Jocco podcast number 149 with echo Charles and me jocco willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:13.28 --> 00:00:15.28
All my life I've waited for this

3
00:00:17.28 --> 00:00:21.84
Now I've joined you and your losses are a strength to me

4
00:00:23.44 --> 00:00:25.44
I ache

5
00:00:25.44 --> 00:00:30.24
And yet I know that Alec wretched with pain on the dust road that went to Corinth

6
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:34.08
I breathe the dust and

7
00:00:34.48 --> 00:00:36.80
And I know that grandpa

8
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:40.40
Breathe the gas that made a hero out of purging

9
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:46.48
I flinch when bullets tear the air in angry rents

10
00:00:48.48 --> 00:00:50.72
And yet I know that father and

11
00:00:50.72 --> 00:00:56.56
And three farmer boys at pickets charge felt a cutting edge

12
00:00:57.52 --> 00:00:59.52
That dropped them dead

13
00:01:01.60 --> 00:01:03.60
How can I be bitter?

14
00:01:04.96 --> 00:01:08.16
You are my strength you ghosts

15
00:01:10.72 --> 00:01:17.20
And I have learned those things those esoteric skills and knowledge that mark me as one of you

16
00:01:17.20 --> 00:01:22.08
That loose-bowled piles of shit

17
00:01:23.36 --> 00:01:28.08
Too much shit from overeating plop randomly around the outer dikes of a vill

18
00:01:28.72 --> 00:01:29.44
Mean trouble

19
00:01:31.12 --> 00:01:35.60
Catching the aroma seeing the groupings watching flies dance lazily

20
00:01:36.24 --> 00:01:42.88
Rejoicing in their latest fitted morsel that bends the low grass and a muddy glob like a bomb of cow dung

21
00:01:42.88 --> 00:01:44.88
Trouble

22
00:01:44.88 --> 00:01:46.88
I

23
00:01:47.52 --> 00:01:50.000
Can tell from the crack of a rifle shot

24
00:01:50.88 --> 00:01:54.48
The type of weapon fired and what direction the bullet is traveling

25
00:01:55.92 --> 00:01:59.36
I can listen to a mortar pop and know its size how far away it is

26
00:02:00.88 --> 00:02:05.76
I know instinctively when I should prep a tree line with artillery before I move into it

27
00:02:07.28 --> 00:02:10.64
I know which draws and fields should be crossed online

28
00:02:10.64 --> 00:02:14.80
Which should be assaulted and which are safe to cross and call them?

29
00:02:17.12 --> 00:02:20.48
I know where to place my men when we stop and form a perimeter

30
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:29.84
I can shoot a rifle and throw a grenade and direct air and artillery onto any target under any circumstances

31
00:02:29.84 --> 00:02:40.40
I can dress any type of wound. I have dressed all types of wounds water to protruding intestines with my canteen to keep them from cracking under sunbake

32
00:02:41.12 --> 00:02:45.92
Patched sucking chest with plastic tied off stumps with field expedient turnicates

33
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.60
I can call them metavac helicopter's talk them could jol them dare them into any zone

34
00:02:53.60 --> 00:03:00.40
I do these things experience these things repeatedly daily

35
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:10.56
Their terrors and miseries are so compelling and yet so regular that I have ascended to a high emotion that is nonetheless

36
00:03:11.12 --> 00:03:13.12
accrusted numbness

37
00:03:14.56 --> 00:03:19.44
I am an automaton bent on survival agent and prisoner of my misery

38
00:03:19.44 --> 00:03:23.44
How terribly exciting

39
00:03:26.56 --> 00:03:31.52
And how to what purpose will these skills serve me when this madness ends?

40
00:03:33.52 --> 00:03:35.36
What lies on the other side of all this?

41
00:03:38.16 --> 00:03:43.20
It frightens me. I haven't thought about it. I haven't prepared for it

42
00:03:43.20 --> 00:03:49.68
I am so good so ready for these things that were my birthright

43
00:03:52.96 --> 00:03:57.60
I do not enjoy them. I know they have worked me

44
00:03:58.72 --> 00:04:02.40
But it will be so hard to deal with a life empty of them

45
00:04:05.52 --> 00:04:07.36
And there are the daily sufferings

46
00:04:08.64 --> 00:04:10.000
You ghosts have known them

47
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But who else?

48
00:04:14.32 --> 00:04:20.72
I can sleep in the rain wrapped inside my poncho listening to the drops beat on the rubber like small explosions

49
00:04:21.04 --> 00:04:25.92
Then feel the water pouring to river lads inside my poncho soaking me as I lie in the mud

50
00:04:29.52 --> 00:04:31.52
I can live in the dirt

51
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.28
Sit and lie and sleep in the dirt. It is my chair and my bed

52
00:04:37.28 --> 00:04:40.56
My floor and my walls this clay and

53
00:04:43.76 --> 00:04:45.76
Like all of you

54
00:04:46.32 --> 00:04:53.60
I have endured diarrhea as only an animal should endure it squatting a yard off the trail and relieving myself

55
00:04:54.16 --> 00:04:56.16
Unsurimoniously naturally

56
00:04:56.48 --> 00:04:58.48
Animally

57
00:04:58.48 --> 00:05:00.48
Depervations of food

58
00:05:01.20 --> 00:05:03.20
Festering open source

59
00:05:03.20 --> 00:05:08.56
Worms heat aching crotch that nags for fulfillment

60
00:05:09.20 --> 00:05:11.20
Any emptying hole that will relieve it

61
00:05:14.16 --> 00:05:16.16
Who appreciates my sufferings?

62
00:05:19.28 --> 00:05:21.28
Who do I suffer for?

63
00:05:26.56 --> 00:05:27.92
And that

64
00:05:27.92 --> 00:05:30.40
Right there is a excerpt from a book

65
00:05:30.40 --> 00:05:35.20
That is called fields of fire and it was written after

66
00:05:36.32 --> 00:05:39.60
The Vietnam War by a marine who served there

67
00:05:41.84 --> 00:05:48.40
In this book paints a picture of of combat and in fact it actually does more than that because a picture

68
00:05:50.32 --> 00:05:55.84
You know picture supposed to paint a thousand words or say a thousand words, but pictures don't always

69
00:05:55.84 --> 00:05:59.20
Properly convey thoughts and emotions

70
00:06:01.04 --> 00:06:03.76
You need words to make that happen and this book

71
00:06:04.40 --> 00:06:10.80
Really captures all of it horror fear discussed love hate in difference

72
00:06:12.16 --> 00:06:14.72
The chaos of combat the sorrow of loss

73
00:06:15.60 --> 00:06:17.60
heroism

74
00:06:19.20 --> 00:06:21.36
And of course in all that human nature

75
00:06:21.36 --> 00:06:23.36
and

76
00:06:24.32 --> 00:06:26.32
And

77
00:06:26.88 --> 00:06:33.60
As I always say about this podcast while yes, it is about war and it's about leadership and it's about atrocities and it's about struggle

78
00:06:33.60 --> 00:06:36.08
It is most importantly it's about human nature

79
00:06:37.60 --> 00:06:43.68
And on top of that the incredible power of the human will and this book fields of fire

80
00:06:43.68 --> 00:06:50.08
gives us a very close examination of human nature in all of its glory

81
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:57.92
And of course in all of its horror as well and the book was written by

82
00:06:58.96 --> 00:07:02.08
a man by the name of James Webb who was a marine

83
00:07:03.28 --> 00:07:05.28
Officer Vietnam

84
00:07:05.28 --> 00:07:11.84
recipient of the navy cross former secretary the navy former senator from the great state of Virginia

85
00:07:13.44 --> 00:07:16.48
He's written a bunch of other books tan i believe

86
00:07:17.76 --> 00:07:22.16
He's written and produced movies all kinds of stuff on top of that he's has

87
00:07:23.44 --> 00:07:30.24
Five children from correct one of those children Jim also served in the Marine Corps and it was actually

88
00:07:30.24 --> 00:07:36.80
Who's time in Ramadi overlapped with my time in Ramadi where he served as a

89
00:07:38.16 --> 00:07:40.16
As a O311 rifleman

90
00:07:40.88 --> 00:07:45.44
As a member of the one six Marines and also as a radio man in staple tune

91
00:07:47.76 --> 00:07:49.76
So

92
00:07:49.92 --> 00:07:54.08
It's awesome to read these books and know their history

93
00:07:54.08 --> 00:08:02.72
And it's even more awesome and an absolute honor to have with us here today the author of the book field'sifier

94
00:08:04.48 --> 00:08:07.76
And also his son so

95
00:08:08.64 --> 00:08:09.84
Sir

96
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:11.84
Thank you for coming Jim

97
00:08:12.24 --> 00:08:17.92
Thank you for coming thank you thank you. I was kind of wondering because you know

98
00:08:18.16 --> 00:08:22.40
James and Jim and I decided when I was trying to figure out what to call you guys

99
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:26.08
I figured I'd call you young Jim Jim and I just keep calling you sir

100
00:08:31.12 --> 00:08:32.64
So

101
00:08:32.64 --> 00:08:39.12
Yeah, I can't thank you guys enough for coming all for coming all the way out here for on the east coast and and to come on this and

102
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.40
For me to revisit field of fire which is just a

103
00:08:43.76 --> 00:08:49.44
A book and what we're getting to that a little bit later. It's an iconic book about not just the Vietnam War

104
00:08:49.44 --> 00:08:53.68
But really about war and and the the wave laid it out and again what we'll get into that a little bit

105
00:08:55.12 --> 00:09:01.20
But I also wanted to talk to you and and really get some of your backstory as well and you're upbringing

106
00:09:01.20 --> 00:09:05.20
You know we always try and start with the guests kind of talking about where they came from and

107
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.32
What their background was and you have a lot of that actually laid out in

108
00:09:11.76 --> 00:09:13.20
Your memoir

109
00:09:13.20 --> 00:09:17.60
So I was gonna ask if it's cool to call this a memoir, but there it says it on the cover a memoir

110
00:09:17.60 --> 00:09:19.60
I heard my country calling and

111
00:09:21.60 --> 00:09:28.80
I guess what one little section of this that stuck out of me and I think you know obviously we'll let you expand on it

112
00:09:28.80 --> 00:09:32.72
But I'm going to the book. So again this book is called I heard my country calling and

113
00:09:33.76 --> 00:09:35.76
Here we go back to the book when it hurts

114
00:09:37.04 --> 00:09:39.04
Just grit your teeth and take it

115
00:09:40.24 --> 00:09:45.36
Don't out don't you ever back down never start a fight, but if somebody else does never run away

116
00:09:45.36 --> 00:09:49.12
If you run from a bully you will never stop running

117
00:09:49.92 --> 00:09:55.68
But if you fight he won't risk coming back at you again stand up fight back mark him

118
00:09:56.80 --> 00:09:59.76
Give him something to remember every morning when he looks in the mirror

119
00:10:01.12 --> 00:10:04.08
Then even if you lose you win

120
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:09.84
And by the way if you ever run from a fight I will personally beat your ass

121
00:10:09.84 --> 00:10:11.84
And

122
00:10:12.96 --> 00:10:16.16
You go on my father was not exactly a mellow guy

123
00:10:16.88 --> 00:10:21.68
He did not spare the rod, but he taught me early that there is no substitute for moral courage

124
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:29.60
Whatever the cost and that the ultimate duty of every leader is to take care of the people who rely on him when otherwise

125
00:10:29.60 --> 00:10:31.60
They would be forgotten or abandoned

126
00:10:32.96 --> 00:10:35.44
Courage in the face of those above you and loyal

127
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:40.24
He took to those below you were my fathers in alterable standards

128
00:10:41.52 --> 00:10:47.84
The only true way to measure the worth of another human being so there you go

129
00:10:47.84 --> 00:10:52.88
Those are some standards your dad laid out for you. He was a tough guy. He was a tough guy

130
00:10:54.56 --> 00:10:55.44
You know I

131
00:10:55.44 --> 00:10:57.20
Listening to you read the

132
00:10:57.20 --> 00:11:05.20
The excerpt from Fields of Fire I was just thinking about how long it has been and the journey that I have had since I wrote those

133
00:11:05.20 --> 00:11:07.20
Words and

134
00:11:07.36 --> 00:11:09.36
Learning I think we were talking about this last night

135
00:11:10.32 --> 00:11:17.20
Learning how to write by writing a snob or writing an album wasn't active will for a lot of different reasons and

136
00:11:19.20 --> 00:11:23.44
One of the things when when I think about growing up in our family

137
00:11:24.88 --> 00:11:27.52
Was that my dad was a leader

138
00:11:28.72 --> 00:11:33.84
More than anything he was a leader and you know bit different families have different conversations when you're

139
00:11:33.84 --> 00:11:39.36
Sitting around the dinner table but his was always you know he we talk about different issues

140
00:11:39.36 --> 00:11:43.44
But it was always how do you lead how do you motivate people?

141
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
one of his

142
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.80
Slogans was you can make people do something or you can make people want to do something and

143
00:11:52.32 --> 00:11:56.08
So in a nutshell, you know learning from him you know

144
00:11:56.96 --> 00:11:58.96
He was a criminal a Terry

145
00:11:58.96 --> 00:12:07.28
Person he's enlisted in World War II became a bomber pilot B 17 B 29 and then was in Berlin air lift and when I was very young

146
00:12:08.88 --> 00:12:12.48
Was transitioning into jets for the Korean war and the

147
00:12:13.52 --> 00:12:17.44
Air pressure in a cockpit blew out the jet blew it blew his ear to him's out he got grounded

148
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.36
I'll never forget that day when he came home when he he couldn't fly anymore

149
00:12:21.76 --> 00:12:26.32
We're getting right from the walk into the door and my mom says it took you to as wings away

150
00:12:26.32 --> 00:12:30.80
Don't ever mention it he walked in and he was still wearing his wings

151
00:12:30.80 --> 00:12:35.12
So you know once you qualify then you don't take off and so first thing I said everyone was hey dad

152
00:12:35.12 --> 00:12:37.12
You they let you keep your wings

153
00:12:37.68 --> 00:12:39.68
He's a go upstairs

154
00:12:40.48 --> 00:12:46.56
But then he was a pioneer in the muscle program still didn't have a college degree put the first Atlas in for the Air Force again

155
00:12:46.72 --> 00:12:54.40
one of the one of the great things to observe as a teenager was when they gave him the command of

156
00:12:54.40 --> 00:13:01.36
An Atlas Thor scout junior a missile squadron the the success rate on the Atlas at this time out of

157
00:13:01.84 --> 00:13:07.20
Vanneberg we had opened up Vanneberg it was an 85,000 acre wilderness when I first went out there and they agreed

158
00:13:07.68 --> 00:13:16.80
But the success rate and that squadron was a 11% and he made it 100% 12 out of 12 successful launches and I'd go with them

159
00:13:16.80 --> 00:13:23.52
Up to the the pads don't you know why not in 16 17 and watch how he dealt with his people you wait

160
00:13:23.52 --> 00:13:29.20
You just trumped because I always talk about how I bring my ace to bring my son out to the training grounds and let him shoot machine guns and stuff

161
00:13:29.20 --> 00:13:33.04
But you your dad brought you out let you shoot missiles. Let me watch you just

162
00:13:33.68 --> 00:13:36.48
You just trumped me as the you know

163
00:13:36.48 --> 00:13:39.68
You could back then you know I could go sit a sitting on a blockhouse

164
00:13:40.24 --> 00:13:45.76
Like a thousand yards away from war one of these that was so far but watch and how he treated his people and

165
00:13:45.76 --> 00:13:49.28
On a you know he'd been deployed a lot when he went back

166
00:13:49.84 --> 00:13:56.16
Into the milk he got rift at the end of war war two because he didn't have a college degree he that when they brought him back in they he was either deployed or

167
00:13:57.36 --> 00:14:03.36
Stationed at bases that did not have military housing for three and a half years and we were up in St. Joe, Missouri where I was born

168
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:06.48
My father's family had come in from the Appalachian mountains

169
00:14:07.28 --> 00:14:10.24
And ended up in St. Joe my mother was from East Arkansas

170
00:14:10.24 --> 00:14:18.24
Very she had a very tough life early life three of her seven siblings had died of childhood disease

171
00:14:18.24 --> 00:14:20.24
It kind of things you didn't even see anymore like her

172
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:26.32
Sister that was an arrow to her died of typhoid fever once the last time we seen America with typhoid fever

173
00:14:27.60 --> 00:14:33.60
So we were up in St. Joe, Missouri my mother had four kids by the time she was 24 years old

174
00:14:34.72 --> 00:14:38.72
And my dad was gone and she didn't know hardly anybody at St. Joe, Missouri

175
00:14:38.72 --> 00:14:46.96
We didn't have these family assistance programs like they do now and it's been one of the great privileges of my life to try to put those into our military

176
00:14:47.36 --> 00:14:49.36
So my grandmother moved in

177
00:14:49.76 --> 00:14:54.56
She was living on Arkansas I mean from Arkansas to California and

178
00:14:55.04 --> 00:14:58.40
Came back up and lived with us for several years and

179
00:14:59.04 --> 00:15:02.40
There was an iron hand in the house, but you know my dad would come back

180
00:15:02.72 --> 00:15:07.52
He'd leave Friday night get off work at one point, but Scott or four space Illinois

181
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:11.44
Drive 380 miles one way every weekend no interstate

182
00:15:11.52 --> 00:15:19.68
You know drive all night Friday night show what we never knew what time Saturday morning, but he'd be in there with my mom set it one

183
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:22.56
Ray's hell

184
00:15:23.12 --> 00:15:25.76
Friday afternoon getting the car and drive back

185
00:15:26.64 --> 00:15:28.64
But his example

186
00:15:28.64 --> 00:15:30.64
taught me more about

187
00:15:30.64 --> 00:15:36.64
the axioms of leadership than anything I learned anywhere else and being able to apply it in

188
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:41.92
The Marine Corps which you know was one of the great prides of of my life

189
00:15:43.04 --> 00:15:50.08
Was really an extension of what he'd put on the table day in a day out and you know

190
00:15:50.08 --> 00:15:52.08
I like Jim got the new

191
00:15:52.24 --> 00:15:54.24
Sun Jim got to know

192
00:15:54.80 --> 00:15:59.84
You know his grandfather my dad very well. We spent a lot of time fishing hunting we're out door family

193
00:16:01.04 --> 00:16:03.04
And we've had the

194
00:16:03.04 --> 00:16:07.04
Same kind of a few thousand hours of discussions I think I'm gonna

195
00:16:08.08 --> 00:16:14.000
Yeah, you can very easily say that the passage you read would qualify as the 11th Commandment in our household growing up

196
00:16:14.56 --> 00:16:16.56
It's passed down to him in the past down to me

197
00:16:17.60 --> 00:16:19.84
Very very very simply never walk away from a fight

198
00:16:21.04 --> 00:16:28.32
But never start a fight, but never walk away from one never quit and you'd be joined to tell you treat those around you and it's

199
00:16:28.32 --> 00:16:35.68
So it's it's it's it's been one of those things I've kept with me my entire life and it's I was lucky to have that kind of

200
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Formative influence at a very young age and

201
00:16:39.28 --> 00:16:42.88
I love the Marine Corps myself but everything I'll learn about leadership is from him and

202
00:16:43.68 --> 00:16:47.52
Being around his bloodthorn growing up and it's absolutely blessing

203
00:16:48.16 --> 00:16:54.32
Yeah, that's that's awesome. I know and we talked about this a little bit last night because I would have guys that are concerned that hey

204
00:16:54.32 --> 00:17:01.68
I'm not around and I got you know two kids and I'm doing another deployment and and you know I always would tell guys look guys have been

205
00:17:02.32 --> 00:17:08.40
I don't know what you call it in you know Viking years or whatever, but I don't know if they called it a deployment back then

206
00:17:08.64 --> 00:17:13.60
But guys have been going on deployment and leaving their families for thousands and thousands of years

207
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:20.24
And and that to me is an example that's it's that you might not be there to directly influence your kid on a day-to-day basis

208
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:27.44
But the when when a young man looks up or a kid looks up and sees hey this is what hard work is this

209
00:17:27.44 --> 00:17:32.72
What commitment is this is this is what sacrifices and they can emulate that you don't have to be there every day to

210
00:17:33.04 --> 00:17:37.76
Instruct them in every single little thing that they do and I mean clearly both of you are

211
00:17:38.24 --> 00:17:42.96
Examples of that you can turn out just fine even if dad is around every night

212
00:17:43.36 --> 00:17:45.36
You know when I was really

213
00:17:45.36 --> 00:17:49.28
When I was really young and he was deployed a brilliant air lift I used to go to a

214
00:17:50.16 --> 00:17:54.16
Better overnight with a picture of him on the runway and the flight line that

215
00:17:54.72 --> 00:17:59.04
Air Force Public Affairs had taken with him and his first sergeant and some visiting general

216
00:17:59.04 --> 00:18:01.76
I still have a picture over my desk today

217
00:18:02.48 --> 00:18:04.72
But that was you know that was good night dad

218
00:18:05.12 --> 00:18:11.20
You know and you look at that and you you gain an understanding of what it means to serve what what your country

219
00:18:11.20 --> 00:18:16.72
Is all about and you know serving your country and also such a thing the one thing I would say this

220
00:18:17.52 --> 00:18:19.52
My dad really didn't want me to go in the Marine Corps

221
00:18:20.80 --> 00:18:22.40
Yeah

222
00:18:22.40 --> 00:18:25.76
From the job that we were just talking about you know when he had the

223
00:18:27.04 --> 00:18:30.56
The missile squadron he had gone to night school for 26 years

224
00:18:30.56 --> 00:18:34.48
He graduated from college my senior in high school and he met it was deep selected for Colonel

225
00:18:35.52 --> 00:18:40.96
And then they sent me to the Pentagon to do legislative affairs and it was the McNamara era

226
00:18:40.96 --> 00:18:44.56
And he would just he would just go crazy about

227
00:18:45.12 --> 00:18:50.64
The Whiz kids who were running the Vietnam War and and weird have his long discussions about you know

228
00:18:50.64 --> 00:18:52.24
You're you're just gonna be meat

229
00:18:52.64 --> 00:18:58.08
You know you're gonna be meat. Yeah the Marine Corps is a political football don't do it his his line was

230
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:01.84
Go in the Navy stay on the ship eat ice cream

231
00:19:04.72 --> 00:19:10.80
And you know what I went in the Marine Corps it was like oh man and and then one my brother went in the Marine

232
00:19:10.80 --> 00:19:14.88
Corps my brother was a hewri pilot in the Marine Corps it was like my boys are Marines

233
00:19:18.96 --> 00:19:24.32
You know going back to your your childhood a little bit you talk about how you move around a ton

234
00:19:26.08 --> 00:19:31.44
Growing up I mean the sound like your dad was a little bit of a habitual house mover even when you get somewhere

235
00:19:31.44 --> 00:19:35.12
He would move you know you're talking about you were in England you live in three-hat three different houses

236
00:19:35.12 --> 00:19:39.60
And it seemed like everywhere you you went you would move around a lot and one of the things you say about that

237
00:19:39.60 --> 00:19:43.28
In the book is I'm going back to the book here

238
00:19:43.28 --> 00:19:50.56
I not only learned how to read a room but by necessity became an acute observer of subtle body language of each new tribal circle

239
00:19:50.80 --> 00:19:56.48
In each place I learned valuable distinctions that helped me to develop skills and insights that carried over into leadership challenges during

240
00:19:56.72 --> 00:20:01.76
During my later life in order to lead people you must first motivate them in order to motivate them

241
00:20:01.76 --> 00:20:06.80
You must understand them in order to understand them you must be able to grasp not simply their words

242
00:20:06.80 --> 00:20:13.28
But the emotion behind their words the same words and gestures can have vastly different intentions in

243
00:20:13.60 --> 00:20:18.88
Alabama and southern California and Nebraska and sometimes even within the same town

244
00:20:19.76 --> 00:20:25.52
I learned to be a receiver of information as well as a careful broadcaster

245
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.72
So absolutely you know on first of all with with my dad moving yeah

246
00:20:30.72 --> 00:20:34.80
We I think the longest way we live in a house was like 17 months while I was growing up

247
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:38.56
You know, if part of it was that you know the Scotch Irish tradition

248
00:20:38.56 --> 00:20:44.40
The ulcer scots that settled apple-latch and mountains and then spread further west and you know there

249
00:20:44.80 --> 00:20:50.40
They'd like to say you know you you haven't you don't stop moving to you've lived in at least two or three houses

250
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:57.04
There's something over the mountain that you haven't seen yet and yeah, I eat that literally yeah, we got we got you know

251
00:20:57.04 --> 00:20:57.84
the

252
00:20:57.84 --> 00:21:01.04
does post-worn word to military

253
00:21:02.32 --> 00:21:03.36
was

254
00:21:03.36 --> 00:21:09.20
You know it would still sell it sort of receding itself in terms of of having large standing

255
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:14.80
Military and where are the missions we're going to be with the space program all this up missile program going on so

256
00:21:15.44 --> 00:21:20.56
Yeah, we buying necessity moved a lot, but then yeah, we'd get in a house Emerald Texas women

257
00:21:20.56 --> 00:21:23.12
Emerald Texas one year we live in three different houses

258
00:21:23.12 --> 00:21:27.44
You know, I saw one on the southern down there on sunset on what such a street

259
00:21:27.44 --> 00:21:30.48
We're gonna move in that house and my brother and I we lived on the back porch

260
00:21:30.48 --> 00:21:32.16
You know they're with the

261
00:21:32.16 --> 00:21:38.000
Windows rattling you know, etc, but as we're destiny either become Marines or a start-of-moving company

262
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
You know, really

263
00:21:40.32 --> 00:21:42.32
So then

264
00:21:42.80 --> 00:21:52.40
There was an ups I was a downside of that and that is you know academically like in went to I think nine different public schools and five years at one point three different schools in eighth grade

265
00:21:52.96 --> 00:21:53.92
No

266
00:21:53.92 --> 00:21:54.56
You know

267
00:21:54.56 --> 00:21:57.60
Continuum in the academic curriculum

268
00:21:57.60 --> 00:22:03.76
When I started in the Ith grade it was in Santa Maria, California when they

269
00:22:03.76 --> 00:22:05.76
Start first opened up vanember

270
00:22:06.32 --> 00:22:12.40
They tested the whole class they took four of us they put us in different rooms. It was like the beginning of GT you know or whatever

271
00:22:13.52 --> 00:22:19.84
You know you're gonna you're gonna be like an experiment you're gonna grow it academically your own rate by the time I got

272
00:22:20.80 --> 00:22:26.88
One two three like the fifth school in in Nebraska I was on non-college prep work where you

273
00:22:26.88 --> 00:22:28.88
These get this guy out of here

274
00:22:28.88 --> 00:22:32.72
You know I ended up you know like you let us go an hour early and I went to work

275
00:22:33.52 --> 00:22:38.88
But I could always take a standardized test and that's really how I was able to get into the the

276
00:22:39.76 --> 00:22:42.16
Scholarship program that later led me to go to the

277
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:47.30
to the Naval Academy but the most important lesson from all of that was I

278
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.40
Was able to see such a cross section of America

279
00:22:52.40 --> 00:22:58.80
First in the military, you know the military was the first institution in the country that was racially integrated

280
00:22:58.80 --> 00:23:03.60
You know we had a totally different environment than if I had grown up in East Arkansas or some world

281
00:23:04.16 --> 00:23:06.56
But also so many different

282
00:23:06.64 --> 00:23:11.92
Communities and you walk in and you're the new guy and you read the room and you figure out where the problem is

283
00:23:11.92 --> 00:23:15.36
But you also as you know from from from the quote that you read

284
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.60
You learn that a big part of leadership is knowing

285
00:23:19.60 --> 00:23:26.80
What motivates people and understanding that different things motivate different people not only culturally

286
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:30.40
But individually and so to sort of figuring out

287
00:23:31.60 --> 00:23:38.16
What you know what a person is thinking when they are saying certain things do what body language means?

288
00:23:38.16 --> 00:23:38.88
etc

289
00:23:38.88 --> 00:23:45.68
I knew translate that into the the combat environment particularly in in Vietnam during the Vietnam War when what I was there

290
00:23:45.68 --> 00:23:53.44
And we had an incredible cross section particularly of the the working side of American society

291
00:23:54.56 --> 00:23:56.56
and and

292
00:23:56.56 --> 00:24:03.60
By that time I've been a boxer for eight years. I I had I had been around all you know a lot of African American my hero

293
00:24:03.60 --> 00:24:08.64
And when I was in high school was African American incredible fighter once the Olympics in 1964

294
00:24:10.08 --> 00:24:12.72
But the Hispanic communities

295
00:24:12.72 --> 00:24:18.88
California the farming communities the southern you know the southern mentality of which my culture deprived

296
00:24:19.76 --> 00:24:25.36
And so when you look at a problem you look at a potential problem you know I got cat ones

297
00:24:25.36 --> 00:24:29.12
I got cat fours in terms of you know the testing scores of people out there

298
00:24:29.84 --> 00:24:31.84
You learn how to how to listen

299
00:24:32.40 --> 00:24:38.08
And then how to make decisions and how to preclude a lot of problems that we're going on

300
00:24:38.08 --> 00:24:44.88
We had racial problems and and the military writ large during that period we are society had these problems

301
00:24:44.88 --> 00:24:47.92
I never had a racial problem and any unit I committed

302
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:52.24
Did you now one of the things that while you were

303
00:24:52.88 --> 00:24:56.64
Jumping from school to school that was problematic although you were learning this stuff about

304
00:24:57.68 --> 00:25:03.36
Human nature and the way people are you know one part of the book here you you say from from the time I was 10

305
00:25:03.60 --> 00:25:05.60
My dad had challenged me to read a book a week

306
00:25:05.60 --> 00:25:11.36
And if and if that did not remedy my restlessness to try and read two books a week read read read here

307
00:25:11.36 --> 00:25:17.92
It's me and I had including poetry fiction history and anything I get my hands on that was about sports or the military

308
00:25:18.48 --> 00:25:20.96
You read that much as a young kid

309
00:25:21.68 --> 00:25:30.08
Constantly and I thought really saved me in terms of the the you know the differing standards and whatever in the schools that I was going to and

310
00:25:30.64 --> 00:25:32.64
the other thing

311
00:25:32.64 --> 00:25:39.12
I did and I would do from the time I was very young was that poetry contest, you know he was a big big reader too

312
00:25:39.44 --> 00:25:40.40
and

313
00:25:40.40 --> 00:25:45.44
So you know all the way through his his lifetime we would do that you wouldn't

314
00:25:46.48 --> 00:25:48.48
You know up until

315
00:25:48.48 --> 00:25:51.36
You know very soon before he passed away we would go every summer

316
00:25:51.84 --> 00:25:59.44
We'd get the the males and the family of the different generations get a fishing camp in Minnesota for two weeks and hang out

317
00:25:59.44 --> 00:26:07.36
Bill fire go for a catch fish clean fish talk talk talking my dad and I would always we do

318
00:26:07.36 --> 00:26:15.84
Kippling or we do the British and the Irish poets and you know one of us had given a line and another would give another line to see who really

319
00:26:15.84 --> 00:26:22.16
Remembered you know and I always knew when I was I in high school when he when he was wanting to go

320
00:26:22.72 --> 00:26:26.56
Go up to Minnesota even at that point because he would go and he start talking to my mother

321
00:26:26.56 --> 00:26:34.16
This one is one poem called do you fear the wind do you fear the force of the wind the slash of the rain go face it and fight it

322
00:26:34.16 --> 00:26:39.04
Be savage again. I'm gonna go cold and hungry like a wolf. I'm okay. I think we're going to Minnesota

323
00:26:41.68 --> 00:26:45.52
That's awesome. Yeah, and and you also say in a book

324
00:26:46.56 --> 00:26:50.88
I knew and as I had always known that I was born to be a soldier

325
00:26:50.88 --> 00:26:56.24
Growing up, you know, we were

326
00:26:57.36 --> 00:27:04.16
Still our an outdoor family hunt fish shoot you know I taught Jim from the time you know six Jim star two

327
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:11.76
When six years old I got my first rifle one I was eight years old it was a part of a long going tradition from the pioneer

328
00:27:11.76 --> 00:27:14.72
Papay near days, you know, here's your here's your rifle

329
00:27:14.72 --> 00:27:22.64
I loved being an outdoors you know I loved all of the mechanics of that part of the world and of course

330
00:27:24.56 --> 00:27:33.68
At that time plus world war two you turn on a TV in a weekend and you've got victory at sea and you know air power and all these shows and and

331
00:27:35.84 --> 00:27:38.88
I loved military history I watched this stuff and I said I

332
00:27:38.88 --> 00:27:46.40
I'm gonna be a soldier and I didn't know at that time really it was a it was a close call and in an ice school

333
00:27:46.40 --> 00:27:50.24
What I would go in the army or what I'd be in my reign I wanted to do that and

334
00:27:51.20 --> 00:27:56.56
When I got to I didn't know what college was we were doing it was not part of our family

335
00:27:57.12 --> 00:28:02.000
Heritage at that time you know directly going to college and figuring out what school you should go to and those sorts of things

336
00:28:02.72 --> 00:28:07.52
So I went around it was 14 years old and my dad and I said debt I want to I want to be a soldier

337
00:28:07.52 --> 00:28:11.04
She said go to college. That's what you're doing college. He says you're gonna be an engineer

338
00:28:11.04 --> 00:28:14.32
I said what are engineers do we say they invent things I said I don't want to invent anything

339
00:28:16.40 --> 00:28:18.40
I want to see stuff that's right

340
00:28:19.12 --> 00:28:22.88
I want to go in the woods I want to know what I want to leave people you know and

341
00:28:23.92 --> 00:28:25.92
so

342
00:28:25.92 --> 00:28:26.72
I

343
00:28:26.72 --> 00:28:34.08
Found out that the the Navy had this ROT scholarship this first scholarship full scholarship program because I could not have gotten the

344
00:28:34.08 --> 00:28:39.68
Naval Academy out of out of high school my my grades weren't that great you know the other things I had in place I think

345
00:28:40.40 --> 00:28:46.96
But the army did not have an ROT C scholarship at that time they had a program where after two years

346
00:28:46.96 --> 00:28:52.56
You could get a full scholarship but you only had a partial at the beginning so I applied to the

347
00:28:53.68 --> 00:28:55.68
Navy scholarship program at that time

348
00:28:55.68 --> 00:29:03.84
You took a standardized test and anybody who passed a standardized test got into the interview process and you could go make your case

349
00:29:04.48 --> 00:29:10.96
So I went with the school it was heavily military kids in the in the school we had 12

350
00:29:11.52 --> 00:29:16.64
People from our school who passed the test and got into the the interviews are valid Victorian

351
00:29:16.64 --> 00:29:22.24
Salu tutorial and all state basketball player all district football player and me as like hey pump your gas

352
00:29:22.24 --> 00:29:24.24
You know

353
00:29:24.64 --> 00:29:33.28
Come see me fight and I really looked out because the two interviewers the first one was a Mustang commander

354
00:29:34.24 --> 00:29:39.60
Who had seen me fight and just totally by coincidence the name was commander ambassador

355
00:29:39.60 --> 00:29:41.60
He says you know where have I seen you before?

356
00:29:42.16 --> 00:29:44.16
Wouldn't me and

357
00:29:44.16 --> 00:29:49.28
You talked about what do you want to do? I I want to do this. This is what I want to do

358
00:29:49.28 --> 00:29:54.80
He says what are you gonna do if you don't get it? I said I'm gonna be here next year. You know if you you know if I don't get it this year

359
00:29:54.80 --> 00:29:56.80
I'll be here next year and

360
00:29:56.80 --> 00:30:00.64
We you know we talked about working through high school because I worked all through high school and

361
00:30:02.48 --> 00:30:07.04
He would come after this he'd come over as packing groceries at the base commester

362
00:30:07.04 --> 00:30:09.84
He'd come by and say hello and the

363
00:30:09.84 --> 00:30:15.92
The second interviewer was a naval academy graduate who had graduated and the bottom two thirds of his class and

364
00:30:15.92 --> 00:30:18.96
From from South Dakota and he he was saying

365
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.96
We don't we got enough brains in this world we need leaders and he threw

366
00:30:25.44 --> 00:30:31.36
Examples out you know like things you're not supposed to be able to solve you probably know this from different interviews

367
00:30:31.36 --> 00:30:33.52
You went through and in your time in the Navy so he goes

368
00:30:34.40 --> 00:30:38.80
We got all this mud in the Mississippi river. What are we gonna do about the mud in the Mississippi river and I said

369
00:30:39.36 --> 00:30:41.36
Commander I'm not thinking about this

370
00:30:41.36 --> 00:30:43.36
I

371
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:44.32
Said look

372
00:30:44.32 --> 00:30:49.68
You know here's what you do you shut that river down for eight hours a day and you run a big

373
00:30:50.40 --> 00:30:56.16
Like a screen through there like a filter big filter on on a rotator and

374
00:30:56.96 --> 00:30:59.60
On each end you put like a car wash

375
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.44
You know with the sprays and so you run you run the filters through and you spray the the mud out

376
00:31:05.44 --> 00:31:07.92
And you put it in a covert and you get a truck under there

377
00:31:07.92 --> 00:31:11.68
I've gotten that's top soil center back up and you know sell it back to the farmers

378
00:31:12.80 --> 00:31:14.80
You said I know okay

379
00:31:15.84 --> 00:31:17.84
And so I got the scholarship and

380
00:31:18.72 --> 00:31:24.80
When you you mentioned fighting and you mentioned boxing and you know that you mentioned it a couple times and

381
00:31:25.20 --> 00:31:27.68
Well obviously I like fighting and

382
00:31:28.80 --> 00:31:32.72
One of the things I mean I always I'm I'm more of a jjjjjjjjjj

383
00:31:32.72 --> 00:31:38.72
But the things that jjjjjjjj teaches you about life and about everything really and I know a lot of those similar lessons come from boxing

384
00:31:39.44 --> 00:31:40.80
You had a nice little

385
00:31:41.60 --> 00:31:48.08
nice little thing about boxing and here and I just wanted to throw it out there before we jump too much further because you know boxing stays

386
00:31:48.08 --> 00:31:51.68
with you through your through your naval Academy career and whatnot

387
00:31:52.40 --> 00:31:59.52
But here we go back to the book boxing and the roughhewn world in which the sport resided taught me valuable lessons about

388
00:31:59.52 --> 00:32:05.52
human struggle and the thin line between success and failure. In the ring, you quickly

389
00:32:05.52 --> 00:32:11.28
learned that life was not always fair and that it's not always off for you a face saving

390
00:32:11.28 --> 00:32:16.88
time out when things were going badly. Once the bell rang, you're out there by yourself

391
00:32:16.88 --> 00:32:22.24
exposed for all the world to see until it rang again. No excuses, no sitting out for a

392
00:32:22.24 --> 00:32:26.96
couple of plays just because somebody hit you so hard you couldn't see straight and your toes

393
00:32:26.96 --> 00:32:37.12
felt numb. When my kids compete in jujitsu a lot when they were little and I would see these kids

394
00:32:37.12 --> 00:32:41.92
would go to these tournaments and jujitsu tournaments are very popular especially out here in California

395
00:32:41.92 --> 00:32:46.96
at that time and they're popular everywhere now but I would notice that when a kid loses

396
00:32:46.96 --> 00:32:50.80
because my kid's played all kinds of sports whenever soccer and basketball and this and that

397
00:32:50.80 --> 00:32:54.80
the kid if the team loses the soccer game the kids you know they walk off the field

398
00:32:54.80 --> 00:33:00.64
when a kid loses a jujitsu match and this is just not just my kids but like 90% of kids when they

399
00:33:00.64 --> 00:33:04.96
lose that jujitsu match when there's six years old when there's seven years old they're gonna

400
00:33:04.96 --> 00:33:10.88
start crying and you know it made sense to me instantly there's two parts of it that make sense to me.

401
00:33:10.88 --> 00:33:15.12
Number one, they're by themselves there's no one to blame it's not an even lots of fault

402
00:33:15.12 --> 00:33:23.60
them team it's just them and number two when you get beat in a combat sport it's there's

403
00:33:23.60 --> 00:33:30.96
there's a primal thing that you just realize you got beat by another human being in this game

404
00:33:31.60 --> 00:33:36.96
and it's not a game and so it's like you said it's like there's no there's no way out of it

405
00:33:37.92 --> 00:33:42.96
and for me those lessons that people take away from combat sports are extremely important and

406
00:33:42.96 --> 00:33:47.92
it's the things that you just talked about right here. Yeah absolutely right and on a number of

407
00:33:47.92 --> 00:33:53.44
different levels you know and one thing about well first of all I want to think about jujitsu

408
00:33:53.44 --> 00:33:58.64
is you know when I was a kid I used to read a lot and read a lot about Asian history and you

409
00:33:58.64 --> 00:34:05.92
learn the the Japanese philosophy behind it which is to take your opponent's strength and use it

410
00:34:05.92 --> 00:34:10.88
against him you know it was just a kind of a different thing than boxing but I've always thought

411
00:34:10.88 --> 00:34:17.84
about that you know and in other areas of of of of my life I've thought about that and in terms of

412
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:25.92
boxing you know you never know who the judges are you know and you know you you're you're

413
00:34:25.92 --> 00:34:32.40
absolutely right I mean nothing nothing is worse than losing when it's just you out there if it

414
00:34:32.40 --> 00:34:37.68
went to the team out there you know you've got you got people you can pat on the back and whatever but

415
00:34:37.68 --> 00:34:44.40
it's just you or is one of the great fighters in Omaha and on his fight and used to say it's just

416
00:34:44.40 --> 00:34:54.24
you and other guy and all that smoke but so you you learn to deal with and you know when I say

417
00:34:54.24 --> 00:34:59.44
you know you may you may perceive unfairness you know you you're all right you know I think I

418
00:34:59.44 --> 00:35:03.04
won that fight but you can't talk about it for the rest of your life you just say all right you

419
00:35:03.04 --> 00:35:10.08
got to you got to swallow it and you got to say that was that and the other thing is you have to prepare

420
00:35:10.08 --> 00:35:16.16
you know when you when you say I'm gonna you know like 15 16 years I could I could be fighting

421
00:35:16.16 --> 00:35:21.12
front of 3000 people you know Omaha's and then I'm a lot going on in the winter and you know

422
00:35:21.12 --> 00:35:25.68
was cold and then coming to the Colosseum and watch and there were good fighters you know really

423
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:33.68
oh my god I'm a good fighter set back now including a professional stable as well but yeah I'm

424
00:35:33.68 --> 00:35:38.56
going to be in front of 3000 people and I don't want to look like an ass you know and so you put it

425
00:35:38.56 --> 00:35:45.28
on yourself you put preparation on yourself which actually is a great learning tool for being a writer

426
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.52
you know you you may think you're working hard or you may think you're just passing the time but

427
00:35:51.52 --> 00:35:56.16
when the book comes out you're gonna be exposed to all these reviews and that sort of stuff you know

428
00:35:56.16 --> 00:36:04.72
so um and also it's kind of interesting because I was just talking to a friend of mine who is in

429
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:09.92
government right now who is a very fine football player and we were comparing it was talking about

430
00:36:09.92 --> 00:36:14.56
how hard it was to deal with a certain individual because he'd been a wrestler and he didn't understand how

431
00:36:14.56 --> 00:36:20.24
you know you get the team around you to solve these problems well you know you learn to step forward

432
00:36:20.24 --> 00:36:25.84
and take responsibility for solutions you know if you're an individual support I mean they

433
00:36:25.84 --> 00:36:31.04
probably more than any other kind of a sport you know it's like all right this is what I believe

434
00:36:31.04 --> 00:36:35.52
and this is what I'm gonna fight for and if we lose with those but this is what we're going to do and

435
00:36:35.52 --> 00:36:44.48
in my life combining that with with the Marine Corps you know where you are responsible for the

436
00:36:44.48 --> 00:36:51.52
lives of other people and you have to make decisions that affect other people there couldn't have

437
00:36:51.52 --> 00:36:58.88
been better training for any other leadership situation I've been in when when going back to where

438
00:36:58.88 --> 00:37:05.76
you got selected amongst for this scholarship program you one thing you said is here nobody's

439
00:37:05.76 --> 00:37:11.84
gonna work me to have so as I remember the day I got that because I just say okay I'm gonna

440
00:37:11.84 --> 00:37:16.80
wrap myself a little tighter here you know somebody up there likes me I remember that what I you

441
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:24.48
know when the you got the the letter from the navy in the mailbox if it was a thin little letter

442
00:37:24.48 --> 00:37:30.16
you know as a no you know and I got the packet and her was cold I got that packet and I went

443
00:37:30.16 --> 00:37:39.04
I did this and I am gonna bust my tail you know and then you came all right back then it was like

444
00:37:39.04 --> 00:37:45.92
there were 51 schools that had these programs and you you listed the top six in order and then

445
00:37:45.92 --> 00:37:52.32
yes no yes no will I go to these others and I'm sitting in Omaha Nebraska freezing how go anywhere

446
00:37:52.32 --> 00:37:57.76
and I put down the six warmest schools I did not know the University of California from

447
00:37:58.48 --> 00:38:03.52
the man in the moon but I said University of California sounds warm and I and I put it on the top

448
00:38:04.08 --> 00:38:08.16
and I got into University of California I mean they didn't have there in Nebraska quote of

449
00:38:08.16 --> 00:38:14.96
that here or something I don't know and had a great time there did very well in the military program

450
00:38:14.96 --> 00:38:20.24
and my my Marine Corps the Marine Corps officer in the program said you you really should go

451
00:38:20.24 --> 00:38:25.28
to the academy you know and so did my dad my dad so so how much fun I was having done there

452
00:38:25.28 --> 00:38:34.08
and I did like this boy up you know and so so you applied then for the naval academy while you're

453
00:38:34.08 --> 00:38:43.84
at USC does and it was that were you surprised to get in there well um I think first of all I had

454
00:38:43.84 --> 00:38:50.48
I had ranked first in the leadership programs at Southern Cal and I got strong recommendations

455
00:38:51.52 --> 00:38:58.96
major hunter-coffler was the the Marine and my Lieutenant Covern was the the naval instructor

456
00:38:58.96 --> 00:39:05.60
and they both wrote strong letters for me and I had to get letters of recommendation from high school and

457
00:39:05.60 --> 00:39:10.56
you know when I was a high school I did really well in the leadership programs even though I've

458
00:39:10.56 --> 00:39:16.08
got put in dummy English my senior year you know and you know we were like what did you do last

459
00:39:16.08 --> 00:39:22.32
summer while they were studying the great artists but the woman who was was my teacher she saw

460
00:39:22.32 --> 00:39:29.36
how much I love to write and and read and the sort of thing I'd say and so she wrote me a wonderful

461
00:39:29.36 --> 00:39:35.92
letter and then you know I was on the presidential appointment side which was the active duty military

462
00:39:35.92 --> 00:39:43.28
uh and I think they took I can't remember now where they took 50 or 75 but they took a certain

463
00:39:43.28 --> 00:39:49.60
number from the from the country and I got in so so you know the naval academy is a is a

464
00:39:50.72 --> 00:39:55.92
is a story unto itself you have one section in I obviously can go to the naval academy of course

465
00:39:55.92 --> 00:40:03.44
I worked with a ton of people over the years that that did but I thought that this little story

466
00:40:03.44 --> 00:40:09.04
well I just thought it might capture some stuff about the naval academy and I'm going to read

467
00:40:09.04 --> 00:40:15.44
this going again this is still from the book I heard my country calling after did I reported to the

468
00:40:15.44 --> 00:40:21.20
room across the hall where the four who had joined evening come around towards its end

469
00:40:21.92 --> 00:40:29.60
turns beating me with a cricket bat touch your toes I I sir I would lean over and touch my toes

470
00:40:29.60 --> 00:40:35.36
they would hit me swinging the bat as if taking batting practice for slow pitch softball game

471
00:40:36.32 --> 00:40:41.12
I would then come to attention and resume my brace which is standing at the position of attention

472
00:40:41.12 --> 00:40:48.80
beat army sir did that hurt web no sir touch your toes I I sir the bat would connect again

473
00:40:48.80 --> 00:40:57.20
beat army sir did it hurt no sir okay touch your toes I I sir the blow would come I would

474
00:40:57.20 --> 00:41:04.40
straighten up again beat army sir did it hurt no sir after they had each hit a couple of slow pitch

475
00:41:04.40 --> 00:41:10.48
home runs it had apparently stopped being fun and their exuberance diminished one of them finally told

476
00:41:10.48 --> 00:41:16.32
me that if I would simply admit that it hurt they would stop beating me but for all I knew even this

477
00:41:16.32 --> 00:41:20.72
guarantee could have been double think if I told them it hurt would I really be allowed to leave

478
00:41:20.72 --> 00:41:24.88
or would it just bring yet another lecture and another round or worse yet did they really want to

479
00:41:24.88 --> 00:41:30.40
send me back across the hallway I had already dealt with doctor no pain before dinner I did not

480
00:41:30.40 --> 00:41:34.72
want to survive the cricket bat only to go back to the toothpick which was another torture they

481
00:41:34.72 --> 00:41:39.68
were putting through the pain actually left my body or maybe it was merely my brains reaction

482
00:41:39.68 --> 00:41:43.52
as I would later find out with Marines who were wounded so severely that their nervous

483
00:41:43.52 --> 00:41:49.04
systems became overloaded and shut down so that they could not feel any pain I had I had detached

484
00:41:49.04 --> 00:41:54.80
myself from the moment it was as if I was watching myself from another room did it hurt web

485
00:41:54.80 --> 00:42:02.56
no sir just tell us that it hurt idiot did it hurt I could hear worrying his voice somehow

486
00:42:02.56 --> 00:42:08.08
the very abuse that they were now weary of perpetrating head inspired me by refusing to lose

487
00:42:08.08 --> 00:42:14.32
I felt that I was somehow winning no sir touch your toes another blow beat army sir

488
00:42:15.04 --> 00:42:20.08
behind me I heard them discussing that the bat had split lengthwise on my ass

489
00:42:20.08 --> 00:42:31.36
alright get out of here web I sir so yeah what year was this 1964 yeah

490
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:37.12
naval academy was a different place needless to say then it is now

491
00:42:40.56 --> 00:42:45.60
young when Bob Timber was writing his book nightingale song we discussed that that it's a

492
00:42:45.60 --> 00:42:55.28
and one of the comments he made was he meeting me was not particularly bitter about it but he could

493
00:42:55.28 --> 00:43:01.92
still give me the individuals names and I still could I'm not going to but you know that

494
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:08.96
the naval academy at that time you know the pendulum swings in terms of indoctrination

495
00:43:08.96 --> 00:43:13.20
and the you know where education fits in and what type of education etc etc

496
00:43:13.20 --> 00:43:18.16
but that our this class in the 1968

497
00:43:20.16 --> 00:43:25.28
depending on them in terms of pleb and doctrine nation had swung very far and it was by company really

498
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:30.72
they were like tribal systems were 36 different companies and some of them were relatively loose

499
00:43:30.72 --> 00:43:37.76
and some of them were really you know actually we had two two companies in in my class that ran out

500
00:43:37.76 --> 00:43:42.24
physically ran out more than half of their plebes and these are people who were highly screen I

501
00:43:42.24 --> 00:43:47.12
give some details in the book about the number of class validic torrents varsity athletes

502
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:52.56
eagle scouts etc which actually when people have asked me you know what what's the great benefit

503
00:43:52.56 --> 00:43:57.84
you got out of going to the naval academy one thing I said as well I knew that I could achieve

504
00:43:57.84 --> 00:44:02.56
among these people who had achieved in different ways and in high school I had I learned you know

505
00:44:02.56 --> 00:44:07.84
that I could compete in and that you know why was on the right track at a two to one everything

506
00:44:07.84 --> 00:44:18.96
but this class I think we started with 1350 and the first week or two of a pleb year when some

507
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:24.16
people resigned they allowed new increments to come in just for very short period of time so let's just

508
00:44:24.16 --> 00:44:30.80
stick with 1350 I think we graduated 841 we had the highest attrition rate of any post war

509
00:44:30.80 --> 00:44:38.000
naval academy and post war war two naval academy class and there were some really people who

510
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:46.72
would have been fine officers who were run out for one reason or left and that time period two

511
00:44:47.84 --> 00:44:53.20
coincided with the very beginning of the Vietnam War the civil rights movement a lot of different

512
00:44:53.20 --> 00:44:56.88
you know things that were tearing the country aside I can remember coming back from boxing

513
00:44:56.88 --> 00:45:03.12
practice in summer of 1964 we had to know the one of the rates when you went down on the tables was to

514
00:45:03.12 --> 00:45:08.80
know the three top new stories of the day and there on the front page with the Gulf of Tonkin incident

515
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:16.96
you know in the Gulf of the coast of Hanoi the picture of the CO and we were like saying okay

516
00:45:17.52 --> 00:45:23.92
this is this is really going to happen we the year that I graduated in 1968 was was the the

517
00:45:23.92 --> 00:45:33.84
worst year for American casualties and it also was the year where in April Martin Luther King was

518
00:45:33.84 --> 00:45:40.24
killed and in June the night before we graduated Robert Kennedy was assassinated it was just in

519
00:45:40.24 --> 00:45:46.64
an end to back it up into the Tet 68 offensive happened before Martin Luther King was killed so

520
00:45:46.64 --> 00:45:53.68
that we just boom boom boom the last year and different people reacted in different ways but I

521
00:45:53.68 --> 00:45:58.80
think the majority of the people that I was with there during that period it gave us a real

522
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:03.04
seriousness of purpose we knew we were going it wasn't going to go away particularly for the

523
00:46:03.04 --> 00:46:15.68
Marine Corps we all knew that we were going and so by the time I graduated there was no doubt in my

524
00:46:15.68 --> 00:46:21.12
mind where where I was going to go was one of the reasons why on first class crews you know at

525
00:46:21.12 --> 00:46:27.92
the Naval Academy it used to be after your first year you crueced with the enlisted folks you know

526
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:34.56
we I lived with the Snipes on a CVS after my first app was a great learning experience too

527
00:46:34.56 --> 00:46:39.36
by the way to see how hard those guys worked on here I hardly ever saw the light of day

528
00:46:39.36 --> 00:46:47.36
they were a trip to in a living spaces I remember when they you know that we had like six or seven

529
00:46:47.36 --> 00:46:54.08
midship and in this big living space and you know they're given us the dirtiest job they could

530
00:46:54.08 --> 00:46:59.28
give us you know get down into villages and scrub whether we've saved this for you etc and I

531
00:46:59.28 --> 00:47:04.08
I'd say whatever they want me to do man I'll do and so I remember the day they accepted me we

532
00:47:04.08 --> 00:47:10.08
had this first class petty officer who was kind of like the the guy there and they had one wall lockers

533
00:47:10.08 --> 00:47:18.32
four by four wall locker where they kept all of their different types of books and other supplies

534
00:47:20.16 --> 00:47:26.16
and they had a okay web come on over here and they gave me the combination to that locker

535
00:47:27.52 --> 00:47:33.52
and then they broke out a bottle of booze and they sent a boot up to the to the the mess hall and

536
00:47:33.52 --> 00:47:40.000
and scored a can of apple juice and came back and we said okay you know you're all right well you know

537
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.64
and after my third year because I knew us going to Vietnam I said I didn't like like maybe

538
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:52.88
to see the med so I signed up for a med cruise got on the ceratoga you assess ceratoga and I think

539
00:47:52.88 --> 00:48:00.32
I as I wrote about in this book we graduated the the morning after the airbors really war

540
00:48:00.32 --> 00:48:08.72
of 1967 began and so we we we went we flew to rotis pain then out to suede bay creed where the ceratoga

541
00:48:08.72 --> 00:48:16.32
came in to pick us up and they had just met a fact the USS Liberty the hangar deck was littered

542
00:48:16.32 --> 00:48:22.16
with casualties some of the USS Liberty and when we you know we took the small boats out and

543
00:48:22.16 --> 00:48:27.12
start bringing our gear in and got to the hangar deck and there were marine guards around and

544
00:48:27.12 --> 00:48:32.56
they said do not talk any of these people and you know we went up to our sort of 48 of us that

545
00:48:32.56 --> 00:48:38.48
were on the ceratoga we went up to our living spaces and that was an incredible cruise because

546
00:48:38.48 --> 00:48:43.44
the Soviet navy had just broken down into the med and we were playing games with them the whole time

547
00:48:44.56 --> 00:48:50.32
they crossed the deck the Liberty casualties into the America which took them into Athens but it was

548
00:48:51.12 --> 00:48:56.24
constant air ops on that carrier while we were there incredible learning experience

549
00:48:56.24 --> 00:49:02.88
yeah that's when if you have it seeing air ops on the aircraft carrier the first time that I saw it

550
00:49:02.88 --> 00:49:10.000
I was it's it's it's it's it's insane it's what it is it's insane and that's just normal life on a carrier and

551
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.08
you know the difference in the same thing talking about my dad and the missile squad the difference

552
00:49:16.08 --> 00:49:21.92
back then and now was I had a little eight millimeter movie camera and you know after

553
00:49:21.92 --> 00:49:26.88
even you know I could go sit on the flight deck and take pictures of flight ops you know now

554
00:49:26.88 --> 00:49:31.52
the you know for for safety reasons and whatever other reasons you can't do that but I've got

555
00:49:31.52 --> 00:49:37.44
some great shots of some of the only RA five taken off those things and we had spads on there

556
00:49:38.88 --> 00:49:44.96
and that whole cruise we had an A4 they said with a new gun at the front right catapult because of

557
00:49:44.96 --> 00:49:51.60
the situation it was going on the middle east so yeah that's it this is uh I thought pretty pertinent here

558
00:49:51.60 --> 00:49:56.16
is you're you're at the academy and this is what you're talking about right now but going back to the

559
00:49:56.16 --> 00:50:01.68
book as the Vietnam War gathered intensity the leadership of the brigade began posting pictures and

560
00:50:01.68 --> 00:50:07.04
biographies of alumni who had been killed or missing an action on a large board in the middle of

561
00:50:07.04 --> 00:50:14.80
the rotunda just inside the main entrance to bank roft hall the pictures and short biographies were

562
00:50:14.80 --> 00:50:20.24
taken from the lucky bag the class yearbook from the year that each alumna's graduated

563
00:50:21.20 --> 00:50:27.04
the board on which the notices were placed was large perhaps eight feet high and four or five feet wide

564
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.64
at its top was a boldly lettered inscription to those who went before of us before us

565
00:50:34.64 --> 00:50:44.32
as the class of 1968 near graduation the to those who went before us board had become two boards

566
00:50:45.12 --> 00:50:52.56
and then three high percentage of the alumni listed were either marines or naval aviators

567
00:50:53.60 --> 00:50:58.80
many of their names and faces were familiar to all of us more than a few included friends

568
00:50:58.80 --> 00:51:08.32
and some of these were especially close so that's a that's a reality for everyone there especially

569
00:51:08.32 --> 00:51:14.08
because in 1964 that wasn't happening and then you go to 1968 and you're filling up this board

570
00:51:14.08 --> 00:51:20.64
do you all buy it every day and look at the you know you look to see what the new faces are

571
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:30.72
and the classes of 66 and 67 in the Marine Corps were hit very hard to test 68 yeah and I think

572
00:51:30.72 --> 00:51:36.08
I wrote about this but I didn't one of the one of the toughest moments you know of that period of

573
00:51:36.08 --> 00:51:42.80
my life was when I was the brigade administrative officer and so you know my job which wasn't much

574
00:51:42.80 --> 00:51:48.64
of a job was to go to one of the things was to go to the main office clear out all the correspondence

575
00:51:48.64 --> 00:51:53.92
in there sort it out pass it to the rest of the brigade staff etc and one of them was bringing

576
00:51:53.92 --> 00:51:59.20
the casualty reps to the brigade first lieutenant who who kept the board on and without even

577
00:52:01.20 --> 00:52:05.60
knowing it while I picked them up I picked up the casualty report of one of my good friends

578
00:52:05.60 --> 00:52:23.84
and you you graduate from the academy and it's time to go to time to go to time to go to

579
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:29.20
time to go to the basic school and learn and you know I've talked about a bit about the

580
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:33.92
base school that Marines on here that that went through it a brine stand and he gave us pretty good

581
00:52:33.92 --> 00:52:42.000
details on the basic school and but obviously at this time for you you know I'm going to

582
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.64
just go to the book for the Marines combat and overseas deployments were unending the greatest

583
00:52:46.64 --> 00:52:51.28
burden fell on the privates and lands corporels fresh from boot camp who populated the lower ranks

584
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:55.04
of the rifle pletoons and the lieutenant's just out of the basic school who commanded them

585
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:01.76
the basic school which we called TBS was now starting a new class of 250 lieutenant's every three weeks

586
00:53:01.76 --> 00:53:09.36
in pre-veate nom days TBS had taken 30 weeks to complete as Vietnam accelerated the time

587
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:17.36
a new lieutenant spent at TBS was reduced to 26 weeks and then to 21 but true to the traditions of

588
00:53:17.36 --> 00:53:22.56
long-held disciplines of the core this reduction took place not by cutting the quality or the

589
00:53:22.56 --> 00:53:27.20
content of the curriculum but by rather by lengthening the number of hours spent in class

590
00:53:27.20 --> 00:53:33.60
and in the field every work week almost every week TBS companies worked late in the Saturday

591
00:53:33.60 --> 00:53:37.52
evening they spent a high percentage of their time in the field and a large percentage of that

592
00:53:37.52 --> 00:53:43.76
time was dedicated to night maneuvers and bivouacs our company was given the day off on Christmas

593
00:53:43.76 --> 00:53:49.04
working late into the evening of December 24th and assembling on the tarmac for a field activity

594
00:53:49.04 --> 00:53:57.52
at 0630 in the morning of December 26th within a month of within a month after finishing TBS

595
00:53:57.52 --> 00:54:01.20
the infantry lieutenant's among us would be boarding military flights to travel

596
00:54:01.20 --> 00:54:06.64
sir for space California to report immediately for 13 month tours in Vietnam as individual

597
00:54:06.64 --> 00:54:14.48
replacements in infantry battalions that were already engaged in sustained heavy combat

598
00:54:14.48 --> 00:54:23.92
well of course let me say something about about basic school at that time

599
00:54:26.16 --> 00:54:34.88
that's probably the best school I've ever been to day as I wrote the the course got condensed in

600
00:54:34.88 --> 00:54:41.36
its time but not in the quality of what they were preparing us to do on the one hand

601
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:48.88
the Marine Corps had dropped the 60 millimeter mortar out of its arsenal after the Korean war

602
00:54:48.88 --> 00:54:53.84
they decided that they didn't need it with more artillery closer etc they learned early in the

603
00:54:53.84 --> 00:54:59.92
Vietnam war that it was a valuable weapon they put the 60 mic mic package back into basic school

604
00:54:59.92 --> 00:55:06.08
so actually added a tactical package into the basic school curriculum they cut out

605
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:14.08
some of the dress and ceremony stuff you know they did take that stuff out not all of it

606
00:55:14.08 --> 00:55:21.44
but some of it but we worked six days a week and we worked yeah we worked on the

607
00:55:22.24 --> 00:55:28.32
24th and the 26th of December we worked on the 31st and the 2nd of July I mean of January

608
00:55:28.32 --> 00:55:37.20
and you know it was I think the intensity actually helped prepare us some of the great friends

609
00:55:37.20 --> 00:55:43.52
of my life were people that I met in basic school we worked constantly together and by

610
00:55:44.48 --> 00:55:51.12
doing this every day you know intensely every day you got a better feel for what you actually

611
00:55:51.12 --> 00:55:55.60
were going to be required to do the interesting thing about basic school one of the reasons I say

612
00:55:55.60 --> 00:56:04.32
it was the best school I've ever been to it was it was like educational it was practical and it was

613
00:56:04.32 --> 00:56:09.92
looking toward the future friends any weapon system we learned every weapon in the infantry

614
00:56:09.92 --> 00:56:15.28
battalion in basic school they would teach it to you in class then you would walk out a symbol

615
00:56:15.28 --> 00:56:24.24
disassembled familiarize it and then you would go shoot every single weapon my first day my first

616
00:56:24.24 --> 00:56:31.12
night as a rifle platoon commander I took the platoon that I just picked up into a night move

617
00:56:32.24 --> 00:56:38.80
night ambush and hit an orthopedic museum with a 51-common machine gun used every supporting arm

618
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:46.000
in the Marine Corps except for closer very first patrol did all the on calls etc and you know that

619
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.56
was basic school so they they go out how did they run problems with you in the field during the

620
00:56:54.56 --> 00:57:00.24
basic school would they take you out of patrol they have up for players that would attack you

621
00:57:01.84 --> 00:57:08.72
planes we ran close air there weren't any planes attacking us and it's a big nom so

622
00:57:08.72 --> 00:57:15.52
I don't know I said I said role players so when you would when you're doing a patrol in the basics

623
00:57:15.52 --> 00:57:22.80
oh I see how did you simulate and how well did they simulate it some of it was was walk through

624
00:57:23.44 --> 00:57:28.88
you know you would start with the walkthroughs first of all we had we had really

625
00:57:28.88 --> 00:57:39.36
talented combat experienced instructors and all of our were platoons were a company is broken

626
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:45.44
on a fight plattance alphabetically you know you know how that works when you're sort of

627
00:57:45.44 --> 00:57:52.48
at the end of the alphabet you know we got the worst gear or the last in line for everything and

628
00:57:52.48 --> 00:57:57.68
I could remember one night where we were getting dismissed we're in a company formation and

629
00:57:59.04 --> 00:58:04.48
one of the was a former listed Marine in in our platoon we were Roberts through

630
00:58:05.28 --> 00:58:10.48
Zell something you know and he's he just started you know this fucking zoo

631
00:58:12.56 --> 00:58:17.44
and from that point for a lot of times we'd march we would go zoo zoo you know

632
00:58:17.44 --> 00:58:25.76
but we had you know our our staple-tune commander had been seriously wounded as a rifle

633
00:58:25.76 --> 00:58:32.72
platoon commander in fifth Marines you know all of all of our put step-tune commanders had had been

634
00:58:33.84 --> 00:58:40.16
in combat there were a lot of talks you know those sorts of things but then on the

635
00:58:40.16 --> 00:58:45.60
tactics side you'd go out you learn it you learn in the class you'd go out walk through it

636
00:58:45.60 --> 00:58:52.24
and then you have a gressor you know not all of these were uh STT called STT aggressors which were

637
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:57.52
in listed Marines just back from Vietnam who just loved to mess with the with the the

638
00:58:57.52 --> 00:59:02.64
basically school who tenants the big problem and the greatest surprise I have to say

639
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:07.84
and moving into combat the big problem was if if you're

640
00:59:07.84 --> 00:59:16.08
uh say for this exercise if you're the platoon commander on this platoon in the attack exercise

641
00:59:16.08 --> 00:59:20.64
you got 49 of the lieutenant sitting there saying no if I go do that way no but you know look

642
00:59:20.64 --> 00:59:24.48
come on man no that's no which you don't need to be online we need to be in a wedge you know or

643
00:59:24.48 --> 00:59:29.36
you know you need to know whatever whatever whatever whatever you know and I'll never forget the feeling

644
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:30.96
of actually

645
00:59:31.68 --> 00:59:37.60
commanding a rifle platoon and combat and being on the move and I just said hold it up and everything

646
00:59:37.60 --> 00:59:42.64
just stopped you know that we're just right now I got boom I mean one of them is everybody stopped you

647
00:59:42.64 --> 00:59:52.88
know and I went wow this is pretty good yeah but you know there were there were things that

648
00:59:52.88 --> 00:59:59.60
could have been taught better the one thing is one of the things that I a very proud of in terms of

649
00:59:59.60 --> 01:00:04.88
the way that we did operate in Vietnam we had had a lot of leeway to innovate and that's that's

650
01:00:04.88 --> 01:00:12.48
kind of been lost I think in the in the history of it and there were I mean it's in letters I wrote

651
01:00:12.48 --> 01:00:17.84
back to officers that I knew talking about you don't really you didn't you have a patrolling package

652
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:22.64
over here you got a platoon and the attack package over here but really what we do all the time

653
01:00:22.64 --> 01:00:28.32
it's we patrol then we assemble then we attack you know or or if we're going to go into a built-up

654
01:00:28.32 --> 01:00:36.000
area as from the the the section you read the excerpt you read from from fields of fire you know

655
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.92
I know when to go online I know when to put my troops on high know where to put my guns

656
01:00:41.20 --> 01:00:46.40
that didn't come from from basically school the separate the separate entities did we connected it

657
01:00:46.40 --> 01:00:51.36
in in the in the reality of of what we were doing and I'll tell you there's a long line we're getting a

658
01:00:51.36 --> 01:01:01.04
little head of things but there there's a long line of things that the young leaders in fifth

659
01:01:01.04 --> 01:01:07.68
Marines had done before I got there and and also in what I was able personally to do is a rifle

660
01:01:07.68 --> 01:01:12.40
platoon and and and particularly as a as a company commander one of the things we saw and I wrote

661
01:01:12.40 --> 01:01:16.72
an article about this concept when I got back from Vietnam was that the Marine Corps fire team

662
01:01:16.72 --> 01:01:24.80
this is simple and small but it really is you know institutionally important the Marine Corps

663
01:01:24.80 --> 01:01:32.16
fire teams for four Marines it was built around the BAR Browning automatic rifle it had it had

664
01:01:32.16 --> 01:01:37.44
had been put into place in in World War II because at the beginning of World War II the Marine

665
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.08
Marines only operate in the squad like 11 11 Marine Squad and they found that a squad that couldn't

666
01:01:44.08 --> 01:01:50.64
control directly control 11 people so they went under the triangular concept with the you know the

667
01:01:50.64 --> 01:01:58.96
the former in fire teams but the problem with that was if you took two casualties you don't have

668
01:01:58.96 --> 01:02:07.20
a maneuver element and it is built around an an artificial notion because the M16 could be fully

669
01:02:07.20 --> 01:02:15.04
automatic you know like I had I kept some in four teens in my platoon as well so what the the

670
01:02:15.04 --> 01:02:21.36
young leaders in the in a fifth Marines just sort of over time to start doing was cannibalizing

671
01:02:21.36 --> 01:02:27.60
the third rifle squad and so in in our rifle platoon instead of having three rifle squads and in

672
01:02:27.60 --> 01:02:37.04
a gun team attached from this notion of weapons platoon we put the riflemen into two squads

673
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.68
and then brought the gun team in as the third squad for the triangular concept and that just kind of

674
01:02:43.68 --> 01:02:50.32
happened you know and no one told us to do it we just said you you know you can't with the casualties

675
01:02:50.32 --> 01:02:55.12
casually flow that we were taking you just couldn't do it any any other way and be effective

676
01:02:55.12 --> 01:03:01.84
with the fire teams as maneuver elements we moved at night constantly fifth Marines we moved

677
01:03:01.84 --> 01:03:06.24
at night we were known for moving at night we walked when we moved for the helicopter assets

678
01:03:07.28 --> 01:03:15.60
in in Vietnam for the Marine Corps were scarce the the H 46 was was built to standards from

679
01:03:15.60 --> 01:03:25.60
amphibious carriers amphibious assault ships so they were built to deck space and you know for amphibious

680
01:03:25.60 --> 01:03:30.000
assaults but then when you get in as continuous ground operation they just wanted enough of them and

681
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.88
it were very vulnerable to ground fire so in in areas where the army would have been you know

682
01:03:36.88 --> 01:03:43.28
picking up with a you know a hewie you know getting breakfast and getting on the hewies and I'm not

683
01:03:43.28 --> 01:03:49.36
running them down this was a great concept the air mobile concept and and moving in on on areas we walk

684
01:03:50.64 --> 01:03:58.32
we have we had for a lot of time we had two H 46's for our entire sector during the day you

685
01:03:58.32 --> 01:04:05.68
don't be supplier and that is what ever so we had a lot of walking it taught you how to fight at night

686
01:04:05.68 --> 01:04:11.12
but also when something happened the casualties were high because you're you know asshole to belly

687
01:04:11.12 --> 01:04:18.40
button when you're walking along you know you hit it you know it was not not an uncommon practice

688
01:04:19.04 --> 01:04:24.64
they get a you know booby traffic I AD go off and you get an ambush on at night you know your people

689
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:34.72
are packed in at et cetera but and 60 mic mic mortar I decided there were people who taught us

690
01:04:34.72 --> 01:04:40.32
this company tactics and basically the 60 millimeter mortar is the company commander's personal weapon

691
01:04:40.32 --> 01:04:45.60
so I decided when I was a company commander I would get sent and I liked this I would get sent

692
01:04:46.40 --> 01:04:51.60
you know way away and at the edge of our battians sector kind of operating independently but I

693
01:04:51.60 --> 01:05:01.04
I'd fire sometimes 600 rounds a day and I'd send a rifle platoon into secure an area when we're on the

694
01:05:01.04 --> 01:05:06.48
move you know it's a payment combat patrol to get a new spot send a rifle to secure the air

695
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:13.04
take a resupply having drop a pallet I was the first time I was in 600 rounds no no that was the

696
01:05:13.04 --> 01:05:19.68
tradition beforehand yeah you can you can home maybe 40 rounds you know but I'd have and drop a pallet in

697
01:05:19.68 --> 01:05:28.000
I'd have been billed two sandbag parapet areas for the 60 week cap two the teo was three we kept

698
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:36.32
two and I'd use them for prep fires I'd use them for H&I's you know and my guys got really really good

699
01:05:39.12 --> 01:05:44.40
yeah the the mortar teams I've been out and filled with the with the Marine Corps when they

700
01:05:44.40 --> 01:05:48.64
you watch those guys set up them fire mortars you know just in training and it's ridiculous how

701
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:52.48
good they are it's awesome thing to watch it's a beautiful thing to watch yeah the reason I kind of

702
01:05:52.48 --> 01:05:56.24
dug in a little bit about the training because when I came back from my my luck from my last deployment

703
01:05:56.24 --> 01:06:00.88
to Ramadi I had to go to the training and so it was it was all that that's all I was trying to do

704
01:06:00.88 --> 01:06:06.16
was getting guys ready for what they were about to face and we had we had this incredible opportunity

705
01:06:06.16 --> 01:06:12.56
you know we had this you ever had a miles gear so yeah so we had something that wasn't miles gear

706
01:06:12.56 --> 01:06:18.08
it was like miles gear but it was infinitely better it was super high speed multi million dollar

707
01:06:18.08 --> 01:06:22.96
system have little speakers on your shoulder so when you were getting shot at you'd hear snaps

708
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:27.84
from these little speakers or you'd get mortar and there'd be explosions going off in your ears

709
01:06:27.84 --> 01:06:33.84
it was it was awesome it was an eminent yeah that they actually had the very beginning of that

710
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:40.24
concept when we went a live fire early on where they had targets were pop up and you

711
01:06:40.24 --> 01:06:44.80
need the target that was the most sophisticated we got in what I found with live fire was

712
01:06:44.80 --> 01:06:49.04
live fire because when I came in it was all we did everything live fire that was the big deal

713
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:55.76
and we still we never got away from live live fire but we added to it this whole force on force

714
01:06:55.76 --> 01:07:00.72
training where you're going against guys with either with lasers or with paintballs and that was

715
01:07:00.72 --> 01:07:05.20
infinitely more realistic because the paper targets never maneuvered on you and same thing when you

716
01:07:05.20 --> 01:07:08.88
had the the guys returning from Vietnam who were maneuvering on you and you were at the basic school

717
01:07:08.88 --> 01:07:13.20
I had all my seals that had just come back from combat deployments and they were the guys

718
01:07:13.20 --> 01:07:18.08
that were going against the platoons that were getting ready to deploy so it was awesome and I would

719
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:25.04
get the feedback I would get was always hey it was it was actually easier in combat you know

720
01:07:25.04 --> 01:07:31.20
minus the the actual death but the threat of actual death the maneuvering that would happen you

721
01:07:31.20 --> 01:07:35.84
know they were used to maneuvering against seals who were badass and now they're maneuvering

722
01:07:35.84 --> 01:07:39.68
against someone else it's not quite as you know in the game and also the enemy doesn't know

723
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:43.68
our tactics as well as we know it so my guys would know the tactics that this was going to be used

724
01:07:43.68 --> 01:07:50.16
against them so it was it was awesome but it's just when you talk about showing up in Vietnam and

725
01:07:50.16 --> 01:07:55.60
and your first patrol you're going out and you're in that and you handle it that's that's a complete

726
01:07:55.60 --> 01:08:01.44
testament to the quality of that training because it's freaking crazy you know I think we were

727
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:07.84
talking about this last night attitude development is the key to everything you know and

728
01:08:07.84 --> 01:08:15.60
getting your mind right is to in terms of what you're going to do and knowing the assets that are

729
01:08:15.60 --> 01:08:20.88
available and you know I've spent a lot of time thinking about this too you know in terms of what

730
01:08:20.88 --> 01:08:30.48
what I was going to face I had I had one really terrific mentor who what when I graduated from the

731
01:08:30.48 --> 01:08:39.44
Naval Academy I spent like two months as a drill officer at the with the new class coming in

732
01:08:39.44 --> 01:08:45.28
before reported to basics school and I was a battalion drill officer there were six of us there were

733
01:08:45.28 --> 01:08:51.44
six battalions I got the marine battalion officer who had just gotten out of the hospital from

734
01:08:51.44 --> 01:08:59.28
him been wounded and in Conteanne was a company commander Alpha one one and he was terrific built stenciling

735
01:08:59.28 --> 01:09:08.56
was his name and you know he'd been shot he'd been blown up and and he was like so easy I mean

736
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:18.56
an noble bullshit easy and easy as a leader and so the other the other five drill officers in my

737
01:09:18.56 --> 01:09:23.76
class they they got their own office you know they're with their battalion officer and stenciling

738
01:09:23.76 --> 01:09:29.20
goes why do you need an office you said you you know so you're a lieutenant now you get an office why

739
01:09:29.20 --> 01:09:36.32
do you need an office you just sit in my office so I'd sat in his office and every day it was like you

740
01:09:36.32 --> 01:09:41.84
know talking back and forth you know and I'd go out and I do you know let's I go do my four miles

741
01:09:41.84 --> 01:09:46.96
and do all my stuff and he come back and he said what are you doing that's all I'm I'm I'm getting

742
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:51.20
ready to go to Vietnam he says you want to know what it's like in Vietnam he said I'm going to take

743
01:09:51.20 --> 01:09:56.40
you out tonight and we're going to get really really drunk and I'm going to keep you up all night

744
01:09:56.40 --> 01:10:04.56
and then tomorrow you're going to work and that's what it feels like and he did you know the next

745
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:13.20
day was like oh man please don't talk so loud sir and and before I before I'd level one of things

746
01:10:13.20 --> 01:10:17.76
I you know I talked to him about for a lift for basis school is it tell me what did it feel like to

747
01:10:17.76 --> 01:10:24.40
get shot at and he goes I don't even think about that stuff I mean it's just you know forget about

748
01:10:24.40 --> 01:10:28.24
that stuff just do your job you know and I was a very first thing I thought about when I took that

749
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:34.32
patrol out I could hear something going just don't even think about that stuff you know I want to take

750
01:10:34.32 --> 01:10:39.12
it to the book here for a minute because well this is the chapter called Hellness very small place

751
01:10:39.68 --> 01:10:43.68
and it talks about exactly what you're saying here so back to the book from the day of my

752
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:49.12
rival as Patoon Commander with dying delta we had been engaged in continuous combat operations

753
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.68
intensified in recent weeks by a series of unpredictable vicious firefights despite a steady flow of

754
01:10:55.68 --> 01:11:00.32
individual replacements the numerical field strength of our rifle company had been reduced by about

755
01:11:00.32 --> 01:11:06.48
half over the past three months this was an equal opportunity battlefield we lost Marines

756
01:11:06.48 --> 01:11:11.60
through every possibility that infantry combat offered including gunshot wounds from several

757
01:11:11.60 --> 01:11:17.36
different caliber weapons and all kinds of shrapnel large caliber rockets rocket propelled grenades

758
01:11:17.36 --> 01:11:24.96
RPGs different sorts of hand grenade 61 and 82 millimeter morbore fire recoil as rifles

759
01:11:24.96 --> 01:11:30.88
plus landmines of every size from a grenade to large caliber artillery shells the rifle

760
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:38.000
platoons were largely made up of young both officers and enlisted by 1969 the vented ranks of the

761
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.24
career and staff NCOs who historically been the backbone of the Marine Corps were showing the

762
01:11:44.24 --> 01:11:51.20
the effects of four years of heavy combat in the infantry battalions that impact was both visible

763
01:11:51.20 --> 01:11:58.24
and profound within a few days of my within a few days my Patoon Sergeant the fourth Marine to

764
01:11:58.24 --> 01:12:04.32
hold this key position in the past three months would leave us a severe case of ringworm covering

765
01:12:04.32 --> 01:12:11.20
his torso including his entire crotch area front and back my first Patoon Sergeant had been hit by a

766
01:12:11.20 --> 01:12:16.80
booby trap while maneuvering one segment of our Patoon onto a ridge line during an extensive firefight

767
01:12:16.80 --> 01:12:22.56
shuffering suffering shrapnel wounds in his hands and arms and stomach area blowing off pieces

768
01:12:22.56 --> 01:12:29.04
of his fingers and slicing his bladder the second Patoon Sergeant had served with us for a couple of

769
01:12:29.04 --> 01:12:33.76
weeks and then was sent by the company commander to another unit the third he picked up his

770
01:12:33.76 --> 01:12:38.72
third purple heart after being hit by an RPG and thus had been rotated out of Vietnam.

771
01:12:39.76 --> 01:12:45.28
The fifth on his second Vietnam tour became sick of the constant combat and suddenly decided to

772
01:12:45.28 --> 01:12:50.40
leave the Marine Corps and our rifle company when his enlistment expired toward the end of this

773
01:12:50.40 --> 01:12:56.80
very operation. In practical terms this turbulence intensify the relationships between the

774
01:12:56.80 --> 01:13:02.48
Patoon commanders and the squad leaders as daily life and death tactical decisions would need

775
01:13:02.48 --> 01:13:09.68
to be made. In these relationships I often ended up being the oldest and most wise and voice at the age

776
01:13:10.40 --> 01:13:17.68
of 23. I was now on my fourth Patoon radio operator who within weeks would be shot through his elbow

777
01:13:17.68 --> 01:13:23.12
ending his days in the Marine Corps. Two months before an April I had lost two radio operators in one day

778
01:13:23.12 --> 01:13:28.40
the first shot through the hand by the end by an enemy sniper as he held the receiver of our

779
01:13:28.40 --> 01:13:35.28
PRC 25 radio in the middle of a firefight. Luckily for our Paltoon if not for him his hand had

780
01:13:35.28 --> 01:13:41.04
partially shielded the radio's handset which survived the bullet otherwise we would have been isolated

781
01:13:41.04 --> 01:13:47.76
surrounded by hundreds of mobile and highly adept enemy soldiers. On combat patrols that ranged

782
01:13:47.76 --> 01:13:52.56
far away from our company headquarters the tactical radio was our soul means of communicating our

783
01:13:52.56 --> 01:13:58.80
position and to call in artillery support and meta-vax. This of course was why the enemy loved to

784
01:13:58.80 --> 01:14:05.60
shoot at it. On our later the second radio operator been blown off his feet hit below the knees

785
01:14:05.60 --> 01:14:11.76
in both legs by a booby trap as we assaulted a ridge. Radio operators did not have much luck in my

786
01:14:11.76 --> 01:14:19.12
Patoon by the time I left Patoon I had gone through six. Two of my original three squad leaders

787
01:14:19.12 --> 01:14:24.32
had been killed one by an enemy rocket and the other from a gunshot wound to the chest.

788
01:14:25.52 --> 01:14:31.04
The third had been shot through the lung and in the liver during the onset of an enemy ambush.

789
01:14:31.60 --> 01:14:36.000
Although grievously wounded he had survived the firefight and was later met a back to a navy

790
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:42.08
hospital ship and so it had been for the officers who had initially staffed our rifle company.

791
01:14:42.72 --> 01:14:47.12
The first Patoon commander had been killed three weeks before the second Patoon commander had

792
01:14:47.12 --> 01:14:52.000
been lightly wounded less than two weeks before and within the next few weeks with sufferers

793
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.48
serious gunshot wound in his upper thigh a bullet, narrowly missing it in artillery.

794
01:14:57.44 --> 01:15:01.52
I had been lightly wounded and would be seriously wounded a month later.

795
01:15:01.52 --> 01:15:19.36
Well let's set the stage. Let's start the final couple days in basic school because one of the

796
01:15:19.36 --> 01:15:27.12
most important what's a speech but one of the most important speeches that I had listened to during

797
01:15:27.12 --> 01:15:33.60
my preparation time was given that there was a marinal lieutenant Carl who was assigned to the

798
01:15:33.60 --> 01:15:41.04
basic school who asked to talk to the infantry lieutenant's with things somewhere in the 70s of

799
01:15:41.04 --> 01:15:52.48
our 243 who finished basics who were assigned to the infantry. This guy was highly respected.

800
01:15:52.48 --> 01:15:59.12
He had been an enlisted marine rifleman on Igimah. He had been a Patoon commander in Korea

801
01:15:59.12 --> 01:16:03.76
recipient of the navy cross and had just finished commanding battalion in Vietnam.

802
01:16:05.04 --> 01:16:11.52
And he said I want you to understand something. Vietnam is the hardest war the Marine

803
01:16:11.52 --> 01:16:17.68
or has ever fought. Not simply because of the casualties which by the way ended up being higher

804
01:16:17.68 --> 01:16:24.56
even than World War II if you combined killed in World War II but because of the living conditions

805
01:16:25.20 --> 01:16:26.96
that these Marines are facing.

806
01:16:30.96 --> 01:16:35.44
We knew this excerpt you were reading was sort of in the middle of an operation.

807
01:16:36.24 --> 01:16:45.68
In addition to those types of experiences people rarely understand in America the America of

808
01:16:45.68 --> 01:16:54.48
then and particularly the America of today what it was like to be in the marine infantry in Vietnam

809
01:16:55.04 --> 01:17:00.64
particularly all of them particularly out in Guangnam province where we fought.

810
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:11.60
The Marines fought in five provinces in Vietnam. Quang Tree which is where K-San and up next to the DMC

811
01:17:11.60 --> 01:17:22.16
to attend which is where K-San was. Quangnam west of Dunei where we fought in Quang Ngai.

812
01:17:23.20 --> 01:17:26.96
In Quang Tien was also a province then it's not a province now.

813
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:37.12
But a plurality and almost a majority of the Marines killed in Vietnam were killed in Quangnam province

814
01:17:37.12 --> 01:17:44.72
and I can't give you a really major battle. I mean there are some operations that are notable

815
01:17:44.72 --> 01:17:49.52
in sort of Marine Corps lore but you know in under country would even recognize them.

816
01:17:49.52 --> 01:18:01.52
These were squad platoon company size engagements and where the constant combat activity

817
01:18:01.52 --> 01:18:08.64
and where the Marines operated were usually outside of anything. We didn't have tents,

818
01:18:09.68 --> 01:18:15.68
barbed wire, we didn't have cuts, we didn't have electricity, didn't have hot food, didn't have clean water.

819
01:18:17.84 --> 01:18:23.44
It was an extraordinarily rough environment in terms of hygiene, potential disease and just the

820
01:18:23.44 --> 01:18:32.96
wear and tear put on human bodies. You put that on top of the combat side and then on top of

821
01:18:32.96 --> 01:18:40.16
what you had mentioned earlier which is the constant flow of people through the apparatus that was

822
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:47.84
the combat unit and the political tensions in the country. You put all that together. You have a very,

823
01:18:47.84 --> 01:18:53.92
very tough environment where the Marines lived and also where the young leaders operated.

824
01:18:54.88 --> 01:19:01.44
So you know when I'm taking over a rifle platoon in that area or the Anwa Abbasin

825
01:19:03.44 --> 01:19:08.72
I'm just off the plane, you know with graduate from Basics School at 10 days travel, 10 days

826
01:19:08.72 --> 01:19:16.56
proceed a little bit of leave, get on the plane, go through Okanala for you know to kind of get your

827
01:19:16.56 --> 01:19:22.64
time zone straight and then I didn't even know what regiment or what division I was going to when I

828
01:19:22.64 --> 01:19:30.16
hit Vietnam. We got to actually on Okanala they decided whether which division you were going to go to.

829
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:33.76
Ok, we're looking at the casualty flow, you guys you're going to third-mark the if you guys

830
01:19:33.76 --> 01:19:39.36
you go on first-markedive and then when you got to an hang headquarters of the first Marine Division

831
01:19:39.36 --> 01:19:43.60
they would kind of sort us out to which regiment we were going to. A regiment they say,

832
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:50.08
okay you want a first-by-tion or first-by-tion is said Delta Delta needs a platoon commander and

833
01:19:51.04 --> 01:19:57.44
get on a convoy take off the the company had been through some you know some serious combat

834
01:19:57.44 --> 01:20:04.40
and the previous days I think they had had five platoon commanders in the previous five or six months.

835
01:20:05.20 --> 01:20:10.96
So dying Delta was the where was the nickname yeah is that like I did a derogatory was that just

836
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:18.32
gal as humor we kind of liked it you just got a deadly dying Delta you know or dog-tired Delta

837
01:20:18.32 --> 01:20:26.08
whatever but you're constantly on to move and you know I'm new and they're justifiably they're

838
01:20:26.08 --> 01:20:32.88
going oh man here we got a new guy here now what and there's always in the realm of leadership

839
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.20
the the relationship that you have to put into place and you don't you know some some people

840
01:20:39.20 --> 01:20:46.16
like to say like to say okay when a lieutenant comes in you can be like the observer for a while

841
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:51.84
and go along in a patrol and what rarely did those people ever fully take over their platoon

842
01:20:51.84 --> 01:20:58.80
you're the ready you're not ready and so I on I picked up my platoon I got them on a side of a

843
01:20:58.80 --> 01:21:05.20
hill and I explain you know did you insert into the field to take home over did you

844
01:21:05.20 --> 01:21:09.28
go right into the field they were on the move they were on the move from Liberty Bridge to

845
01:21:09.28 --> 01:21:14.64
Henderson Hill on a company move the convoy passed by I jumped off the convoy I talked on a

846
01:21:14.64 --> 01:21:20.08
radio to our our company commander you know before and I didn't even get three days in

847
01:21:20.08 --> 01:21:23.92
Anwar some you know usually it three days in Anwar for familiar aces said this guy's class

848
01:21:23.92 --> 01:21:28.40
aren't a man in basic school get him out here now and so I took these guys over ahead of my

849
01:21:28.40 --> 01:21:34.08
side of the hill and I said you know this is Bob Timbergan is booked a nightingale so I called this

850
01:21:34.08 --> 01:21:41.92
an audition for a fracking I said all right I'm Lieutenant Webb you call me Lieutenant or you call me

851
01:21:41.92 --> 01:21:49.12
sir and this is what I expect and I laid it all out you know and and one of the things I said

852
01:21:49.12 --> 01:21:53.28
which I think is very important when you're when you're leading anything I said I want you to know

853
01:21:53.28 --> 01:21:58.80
something anything you tell me I will believe anything you tell me the skies brown I will believe you

854
01:21:59.36 --> 01:22:05.36
and if you lie to me you dead meat and so there was like the hell is this guy thinking he's doing you

855
01:22:05.36 --> 01:22:09.52
know and then we went out that night you know and I sat down I planned it we moved to the new

856
01:22:09.52 --> 01:22:14.000
perimeter and when then I called my squad leader's the guy the company size perviter company size

857
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.44
perimeter I got my squad leaders in I said I mean we got a night act and we're gonna go here and

858
01:22:19.44 --> 01:22:24.72
I think it was a food locks you know got their input listen listen listen listen you always listen

859
01:22:24.72 --> 01:22:28.88
you know being a commander doesn't mean you know all the answers it means you know how to make a decision

860
01:22:28.88 --> 01:22:36.16
you know and how to how to follow through and so I figured out and I listened to them I figured

861
01:22:36.16 --> 01:22:40.72
out a place where we would go I had a really terrific squad leader who was actually acting

862
01:22:40.72 --> 01:22:47.76
platoon commander that afternoon and set a series of on calls that every you know playing the basic

863
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:53.84
school taught you went out that night walked in you know walked into a situation used all the

864
01:22:55.84 --> 01:23:02.88
supporting arms did our thing and that was put to rest which was actually a good thing

865
01:23:02.88 --> 01:23:08.72
and then the other thing which I think is so important you know when you say know your people

866
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:13.92
know you know what's the leadership is knowledge know your people know your job know their job

867
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:18.56
and know the next job because you never know when something's gonna happen and you're gonna have

868
01:23:18.56 --> 01:23:24.96
that next job and it's character and part of part of character is consistency and humility before

869
01:23:24.96 --> 01:23:30.48
your people you know and as you mentioned what the excerpt about my dad moral courage there's

870
01:23:30.48 --> 01:23:35.28
different kinds of courage moral courage is sometimes you got to take the hits you got to lay out

871
01:23:35.28 --> 01:23:41.28
what you believe is right and you got to stay with it and you know vision in other words what

872
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:47.92
even taken over rifle tune you know not they they knew fairly quickly that I knew

873
01:23:48.88 --> 01:23:55.20
what I was expecting even though I hadn't done it yet but knowledge of people and listening to

874
01:23:55.20 --> 01:24:01.20
people I would go in and the first you know month or so that I was a platoon commander I would take

875
01:24:01.20 --> 01:24:06.72
three hours to set my lines in every night sit down every fighting hole talk to everyone in my

876
01:24:06.72 --> 01:24:11.60
roommates and you find out as you know you find out really interesting things about maybe

877
01:24:12.72 --> 01:24:16.88
simple things like somebody hadn't gotten paid or somebody got married and had a queue a lot

878
01:24:16.88 --> 01:24:21.84
and it's not going to his wife and nobody's taken care of just simple things you know and then

879
01:24:23.04 --> 01:24:32.24
then the bonds move from there you you just just to reiterate the conditions because I

880
01:24:32.24 --> 01:24:37.68
pulled out this this section and here where you talk about the conditions and just to reiterate

881
01:24:37.68 --> 01:24:41.68
what you're talking about going back to the book here and in the rifle companies we spent

882
01:24:41.68 --> 01:24:46.80
endless months patrolling ridge lines and villages in mountains far away from tense barbed wire hop

883
01:24:46.80 --> 01:24:52.64
food or electricity luxuries were limited to what we could fit inside ones pack which after a few

884
01:24:52.64 --> 01:24:59.92
humps usually boil down to letter writing material towel soap toothbrush punctual liner and a small

885
01:24:59.92 --> 01:25:05.44
transistor radio due to casualties and disease during this period in the war relatively few

886
01:25:05.44 --> 01:25:12.08
marines would actually survive a full 13 month tour as members of rifle companies in the bush

887
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:18.08
of the basin we moved through the boiling heat carrying 60 pounds of weapons and gear

888
01:25:18.08 --> 01:25:25.84
causing a typical marine to drop 20% of his body weight while in the bush when we stopped

889
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:32.24
we dug chest deep fighting holes and slit trenches for toilets we slept on the ground

890
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:36.88
under makeshift poncho hooches and when it rained we usually took down our hooches because

891
01:25:36.88 --> 01:25:43.52
wet poncho shown under illumination flares making great targets sleep itself was fitful never

892
01:25:43.52 --> 01:25:49.68
more than an hour or two at a stretch for months at a time as we mixed daytime patrolling with

893
01:25:49.68 --> 01:25:57.36
nighttime ambushes listening post foxhole duty and radio watches ringworm hookworm malaria

894
01:25:57.36 --> 01:26:03.20
dysentery were common as was trench foot which in Vietnam was called immersion foot when the

895
01:26:03.20 --> 01:26:11.52
monsoon's came respite for was rotating back to the mud field regimental combat basin and

896
01:26:11.52 --> 01:26:19.76
hoi for four or five days we're rocket and mortar attacks were frequent and our troops manned defensive

897
01:26:19.76 --> 01:26:30.40
bunkers at night that was your break time and what they called it little dn bin foo there

898
01:26:30.40 --> 01:26:34.96
are you know the because they had a sign that's actually welcome a little dn bin foo and you know

899
01:26:34.96 --> 01:26:41.04
to a least they kept their sense of humor to virtually you know how you know people gallows

900
01:26:41.04 --> 01:26:48.96
humor is what gets you through that kind of stuff and to sort of set the tone of the on the on the

901
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:56.64
tactical side need to remember in terms of what was happening to the country at this time this

902
01:26:56.64 --> 01:27:02.64
was a war that had been going on and it had its controversies but hundreds of people were dying

903
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:09.20
every week still every week i i brought this and i know we're not on tv but i thought this

904
01:27:09.20 --> 01:27:14.72
there's a good one you know you're you're welcome to keep this and make copies that if you

905
01:27:14.72 --> 01:27:20.16
would send it back to me but this was the cover of life magazine June 27th night June 27th 1969

906
01:27:20.72 --> 01:27:26.48
that average week in this during this period this was the period of hamburger hill etc the

907
01:27:26.48 --> 01:27:34.24
242 americans died that week two of of on your reins are in in that but uh

908
01:27:35.12 --> 01:27:45.04
well in post post tech 69 period which was April May we were losing more than 400

909
01:27:45.04 --> 01:27:51.04
americans dead a week you know even though the the war had for the americans and cats at least

910
01:27:51.04 --> 01:28:01.68
had peaked in 1968 the the three worst years for combat for americans bit um were 67 68 and 69

911
01:28:01.68 --> 01:28:08.32
they're like the top of the bell curve um we had in in in 69 i think we lost twice as many

912
01:28:08.32 --> 01:28:12.64
americans killed as have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan in the entire war

913
01:28:14.40 --> 01:28:20.16
and you know the american people supported this and i've always believed in and what we were

914
01:28:20.16 --> 01:28:26.80
attempting to do however ever screwed up it got but if you're out here in the in the enwa basin

915
01:28:29.52 --> 01:28:39.36
the one thing that a a good rifle platoon or company commander or batang commander learned was

916
01:28:39.36 --> 01:28:44.96
how to adapt how to adapt you couldn't rarely you could rarely plan

917
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:52.16
operations you know sort of like like Mike Tyson said about being in a fight everything is

918
01:28:52.16 --> 01:29:01.36
great until the first time you get hit you know on any given patrol or day in the enwa

919
01:29:01.36 --> 01:29:08.56
basin particularly near is on a valley you could hit you know some idiot with not idiot

920
01:29:08.56 --> 01:29:14.40
maybe some smart smart individual or small group of people with a couple of grenades or you could

921
01:29:14.40 --> 01:29:22.24
hit a main force the a con unit which was heavily north Vietnamese or you could hit a large for

922
01:29:22.24 --> 01:29:28.40
large force north Vietnamese we fought in in may of nineteen sixteen what we've nine we fought with the

923
01:29:28.40 --> 01:29:34.24
the ninety of the regiment in the years on a valley went on for eight days and eight nights we had a

924
01:29:34.24 --> 01:29:39.52
north Vietnamese division in base area one twelve right off from where we were the the mountain started

925
01:29:39.52 --> 01:29:51.36
up into louse with a hoochman trail that sort of thing we had a very fine of the con regiment

926
01:29:51.36 --> 01:29:57.04
which was you know rather rare that an independent regiment the first VC regiment we had to

927
01:29:57.04 --> 01:30:02.08
Q80 third main force for spatayan that will operate out of the Arizona valley and in you had

928
01:30:02.08 --> 01:30:09.68
a lot of cats and dogs and the other thing was this area had basically been written off by

929
01:30:09.68 --> 01:30:15.92
by American war planners in terms of the the politicization you know they're bringing

930
01:30:15.92 --> 01:30:21.92
into the south Vietnamese government at that time they categorize villages in talk categorized

931
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:32.000
villages a through e in terms of loyalty to the south Vietnamese government a was totally loyal he was totally

932
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
the on the other way and then they had category five which was politically hopeless just for

933
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:43.20
it and by nineteen fifty eight you know the the country was divided in nineteen fifty four a million

934
01:30:43.20 --> 01:30:49.92
people came south including my my wife's entire family not very many what north basically cadre

935
01:30:49.92 --> 01:30:58.32
went north and they trained and starting in 1958 they started moving back into central Vietnam the

936
01:30:58.32 --> 01:31:04.08
Hoochman's idea was to whoever was doing his planning was was to cut off central Vietnam first

937
01:31:04.08 --> 01:31:15.92
anum and so you had these assassination squads move into into this area and by 1961 they were killing

938
01:31:15.92 --> 01:31:24.16
eleven government officials a day and that was by John Kennedy's account when he decided to

939
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:32.32
start increasing our troops there so the villages had had their fights beginning 58 heavily

940
01:31:32.32 --> 01:31:39.68
58 to 62 that time period and those who were staying with with the communist basically had kicked

941
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:45.44
out the people who weren't a lot of move to dinang and some of them later to sagan so out where we were

942
01:31:45.44 --> 01:31:52.32
you I say this because operationally they populated villages that we that we operated in and

943
01:31:52.32 --> 01:32:00.24
they had big family bunkers they were very you know there was stoic when we went through

944
01:32:00.24 --> 01:32:06.80
their people were up in the mountains we had we had no illusions that they were going to be

945
01:32:07.84 --> 01:32:12.32
moving to our our side at least during the you know I never thought the war was going to end

946
01:32:12.32 --> 01:32:23.04
the way that it did but at least during the period that we were there I we were chatting about this

947
01:32:23.04 --> 01:32:28.24
a little bit before but I I wanted to call out this one one point from the book um almost every

948
01:32:28.24 --> 01:32:32.16
marine who has ever fought in close combat can relay a stories of short round stray rounds

949
01:32:32.16 --> 01:32:37.84
misdirected shots accidental discharges and other chaos resulting from friendly fire mortars artillery

950
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:43.36
and air strikes can easily wander from their intended targets sometimes due to map error and other

951
01:32:43.36 --> 01:32:48.64
at at other times because of human error historically friendly fire incidents during mobile

952
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:55.52
close combat operations make up about 10% of casualties. intramural firefights can break out among

953
01:32:55.52 --> 01:33:02.32
friendly units that misidentify their fellow infantrymen particularly while moving through enemy terrain

954
01:33:02.32 --> 01:33:08.08
at night and you got one incident that you call out the CH 46 helicopter approached the perimeter

955
01:33:08.08 --> 01:33:14.000
ready to drop our day is load two hewigunship circle overhead flying for cover the high

956
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.32
highly vulnerable resupply helicopter which would soon be hovering above the battlefield and

957
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:22.80
slowly descending into the small dirt clearing we had scraped out to make a landing zone.

958
01:33:23.36 --> 01:33:27.68
At the center of our perimeter the strobe light flashed showing the pilot where to land

959
01:33:27.68 --> 01:33:34.72
it but circling in the weed beds one of the gunships missed the strobe light for the tracer

960
01:33:34.72 --> 01:33:40.96
bullets of an enemy machine gun the hewie immediately powered tortoise in a low attack line

961
01:33:40.96 --> 01:33:47.12
that came in just above our heads strafing our weary beleaguered perimeter perimeter its machine gun

962
01:33:47.12 --> 01:33:53.20
spitting out hundreds of 762 millimeter bullets. I had just climbed a small sand dune to urinate

963
01:33:53.20 --> 01:33:59.44
at an empty spot away from the perimeter of poncho hooches and radios of my platoon command post.

964
01:34:00.24 --> 01:34:04.96
The hewie's machine gun sprayed back and forth inside our lines kicking up a trail of dust

965
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:10.80
spots just below my feet as I stood in the open. After one pass the hewie was finally waved away

966
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:16.40
back into its circling defensive laps around our perimeter. Exposed as we were it seemed

967
01:34:16.40 --> 01:34:21.92
a miracle that only one marine radio operator near the strobe light in our company command post

968
01:34:21.92 --> 01:34:31.76
was hit taking a bullet in the stomach. Well I that's one among among many and when you're

969
01:34:33.60 --> 01:34:41.52
fighting so so close you know and actually that that incident occurred not too long after an

970
01:34:41.52 --> 01:34:47.36
arclight strike we were doing the BDA on an arclight it's one of the great ironies if I might

971
01:34:47.36 --> 01:34:55.04
made digress just a little bit because I think it's important to point out that in our operational

972
01:34:55.04 --> 01:35:06.24
concepts we never used B52's north of Vin we never until 1972 the Christmas bombing of of

973
01:35:06.24 --> 01:35:12.64
Hanhoy and when I go back I've been back to Vietnam 28 out of the last 29 years I speak Vietnamese

974
01:35:12.64 --> 01:35:20.000
I you know I we still have our disagreements but you know I go back there when I first started

975
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.76
going back to Vietnam in the early 90s everybody wanted to talk about that eight days.

976
01:35:26.80 --> 01:35:31.28
Everybody you know when they did this and they were living under the illusion that they were

977
01:35:31.28 --> 01:35:35.52
with standing American air power when we had these lighter aircraft like John McCain's aircraft

978
01:35:35.52 --> 01:35:40.72
coming in and you know making the runs when if somebody had made a different decision I mean

979
01:35:40.72 --> 01:35:44.72
the wars of war somebody made a different decision things might have might have happened differently

980
01:35:44.72 --> 01:35:51.44
but we did use arc lights on the area that we supposedly were we're trying to salvage

981
01:35:52.16 --> 01:36:00.48
you know go to New England you know we lit that place up we were our our company was I think

982
01:36:00.48 --> 01:36:06.08
three clicks away when when that when that arclight landed and I was holding on to the ground

983
01:36:06.08 --> 01:36:10.72
move into the right into the left you know how many how many pounds of bombs would get dropped

984
01:36:10.72 --> 01:36:17.76
there and there's I've got some statistics in there but thousands and thousands of pounds of

985
01:36:19.12 --> 01:36:25.68
three three B 52s we go over and actually I think in there I put the number right but

986
01:36:26.48 --> 01:36:33.60
you know so but to the the friendly fire incidents and how close it was

987
01:36:33.60 --> 01:36:42.56
you know we the way that we would mark our areas when we're when you're on close air

988
01:36:42.56 --> 01:36:49.04
in that environment you know and this isn't about the helicopter hitting our our guy that was

989
01:36:49.04 --> 01:36:53.68
you know mistaking the strobe for a machine gun around but in general you always run your

990
01:36:53.68 --> 01:36:58.16
air strikes parallel to your lines because you don't want them to drop short you know and drop

991
01:36:58.16 --> 01:37:03.44
on you so they have to make a run you know they're in we put air panels out usually sometimes

992
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:09.52
we pop a smoke but it's better with air panels during the day and so they they'd make a run

993
01:37:09.52 --> 01:37:16.48
before they drop and so they you know they say okay yeah know you're too close know you're not

994
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:25.28
or whatever and we had one and during this period where we were fighting the 90th

995
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.44
regiment out there and Arizona Valley in May we were running an air strike against an

996
01:37:31.44 --> 01:37:36.000
NBA unit in a tree line about 400 meters away and we had a force coming in you know an

997
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.76
air force a fire it's not a bomber I mean we're using for bombers but so the air four

998
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:46.64
pilots they're coming in at I don't know 450 knots whatever it is they're looking out the side of

999
01:37:46.64 --> 01:37:52.72
their window to see to see what's on the ground so we were running the the air force I had

1000
01:37:52.72 --> 01:37:57.36
my普通 actually was we had a rear security in the perimeter while they were doing this

1001
01:37:57.36 --> 01:38:04.32
and they made their run and then they came on the second run and the the F4 dropped on us and

1002
01:38:04.32 --> 01:38:12.24
actually it bounced right outside our perimeter and then you know I can what the hell I

1003
01:38:12.24 --> 01:38:16.24
hear I hear it going right over the top of us so I turned around I start you know I want to go

1004
01:38:16.24 --> 01:38:19.92
into the company C.P. and ask him what the hell is going on so I'm walking through this

1005
01:38:19.92 --> 01:38:24.96
scraggle of bushes and I got all these Marines running the other way and this thing had

1006
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:32.24
bounced and we call this snake and snake you know the snake was the the way I kind of a

1007
01:38:32.24 --> 01:38:39.28
propeller would break out of the the tail to arm it when you're dropping and luckily the the tail

1008
01:38:39.28 --> 01:38:46.40
had broken off of this bomb when it hit so but you know I turned around and these guys are you know

1009
01:38:46.40 --> 01:38:51.60
I see this thing flying through there I thought it was a body you know it's just green thing

1010
01:38:51.60 --> 01:38:56.08
flying through the air and going down to where the or the C.P. and I'm going in and all these guys

1011
01:38:56.08 --> 01:39:03.92
are running the other way and that bomb had had landed on the pack of our 81's F4 artillery

1012
01:39:03.92 --> 01:39:09.28
radio operator I mean pack of the pack board you know dead center if that thing had gone off

1013
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.48
curtains you know and the other thing with it is night moves you know where one of the things you

1014
01:39:16.48 --> 01:39:24.40
learn is in in when you when you operate like the fifth Marines did is always be responsible for

1015
01:39:24.40 --> 01:39:31.84
the person behind you not the person in front of you if you lose the person in front of you stop don't

1016
01:39:31.84 --> 01:39:36.72
try to catch up with them because there there were a number of friendly fire incidents where

1017
01:39:36.72 --> 01:39:44.32
someone would get you lost try to catch up end up to the on the flank of of the the main unit

1018
01:39:44.32 --> 01:39:48.72
and you'd have an animal firefight luckily we didn't have that happening my company but it happened

1019
01:39:48.72 --> 01:39:55.52
in the fifth Marines so you stop if you can't find the see the guy in front of you stop and then

1020
01:39:55.52 --> 01:40:01.20
if then if you can't see the person behind you then you retrace the exact route that you've been

1021
01:40:01.20 --> 01:40:07.28
on to go pick them up so you know there were lessons that were learned and put into place

1022
01:40:07.28 --> 01:40:13.84
you know we we always talk about the fact that and and life was my buddy's particular commander with me

1023
01:40:14.48 --> 01:40:19.44
he and and wrote books with me but um he was saying you know if you would ask him before we went to

1024
01:40:19.44 --> 01:40:25.20
her body if we would have blue on blue you know fratricide situations he'd been like oh there's no

1025
01:40:25.20 --> 01:40:30.64
positive way and and me same thing you know like it seemed like especially in the seal teams it was like

1026
01:40:30.64 --> 01:40:35.92
all that's never that would never happen it'll never happen and sure enough I mean they're in that

1027
01:40:35.92 --> 01:40:40.96
book in our in our first book we happen to write about three different I mean there's 12 chapters and

1028
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:46.40
three of them concern friendly fire because you had to be more concerned about well not more concerned

1029
01:40:46.40 --> 01:40:52.24
about you you had to be at least as concerned about deconfliction and you know we would hang

1030
01:40:52.24 --> 01:40:56.48
we would hang you know giant aircraft panels once once my guys would take a building for a sniper

1031
01:40:56.48 --> 01:41:01.04
over watch position oftentimes if there was any question about where they were they'd hang giant

1032
01:41:01.04 --> 01:41:04.72
air panels right out the wit like as soon as they started shooting in the enemy newer we wanted

1033
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:12.16
to make sure that their friendly's new where we were just as bad so yeah the the friendly fire

1034
01:41:12.16 --> 01:41:17.36
problems had happened but when I came back and I started running training I would induce those and

1035
01:41:17.36 --> 01:41:21.20
and and they happened to a hundred percent of the platoons that I put through training a hundred

1036
01:41:21.20 --> 01:41:26.40
percent of them had had blue on blues you know with paintball or with the laser tag system that we

1037
01:41:26.40 --> 01:41:32.32
used because it's it's one of the things no one thinks it can happen to them you know the other

1038
01:41:32.32 --> 01:41:46.64
part of that to be really frank here um and the the areas where we were operating you know you

1039
01:41:46.64 --> 01:41:51.68
you you don't we'd send night acts out every night you know you you you can move we moved every three

1040
01:41:51.68 --> 01:42:00.16
four days new perimeter you send out listing posts and listing posts and and motions after dark

1041
01:42:00.16 --> 01:42:04.88
and you know you got Marines out there they don't really know where they are you know I mean

1042
01:42:04.88 --> 01:42:12.48
they don't have a map you know two or three people in between them map and sometimes they are

1043
01:42:12.48 --> 01:42:18.88
out where they're supposed to be or they or where they think they are and sometimes you know

1044
01:42:18.88 --> 01:42:24.32
if you get somebody who's getting a little flaky you know they'll say well we don't have to go out

1045
01:42:24.32 --> 01:42:28.000
there well let's let's just go sit in this bomb creator here and I had an incident before I got to

1046
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.64
the company where there was a fire team that was sitting in a bomb creator about 50 meters

1047
01:42:34.64 --> 01:42:40.48
outside the lines and guy stood up like two in the morning take a leak and then reenown on a

1048
01:42:40.48 --> 01:42:45.52
line shot him and you know the guy who shot him ended up being a chaplain's assistant I mean

1049
01:42:45.52 --> 01:42:50.24
you live with that the rest of your life and by the time I got to be a company commander I

1050
01:42:50.24 --> 01:42:59.04
put something into place which was very effective and that is first thing I would do is I would

1051
01:42:59.04 --> 01:43:06.48
send out my night acts when it was still light and I would send them what I called a day pause

1052
01:43:08.08 --> 01:43:16.40
the listing posts out to an outpost further away the ambush to a site I would have them walk

1053
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:23.52
by the site where they you know quietly check it out and then go to a to a pause like a hundred meters

1054
01:43:23.52 --> 01:43:28.88
away whatever so and then when it got dark they both were moving into known terrain

1055
01:43:30.40 --> 01:43:35.76
you know the LP coming back toward the perimeter so they had a sense of security there

1056
01:43:35.76 --> 01:43:40.72
the ambush having researched the you know the ambush and moving back into it and then I would

1057
01:43:40.72 --> 01:43:48.16
mortar their day pause and the first time I did that I had an ambush out about

1058
01:43:48.80 --> 01:43:53.44
clicking a half away and they call me and they go be a fine you drop in mortars on us I say you are

1059
01:43:53.44 --> 01:43:57.44
not where you supposed to be do what what are you going to do if you if you hit something you know

1060
01:43:57.44 --> 01:44:01.52
what are you know where are we going to we're going to really drop rounds on you you know so

1061
01:44:01.52 --> 01:44:08.24
so we've got everything real straight went into out drop borders under your people make sure

1062
01:44:08.24 --> 01:44:12.24
well if you're if I'm hitting you with a mortar you're not where you're supposed to be and

1063
01:44:12.24 --> 01:44:17.28
it's going to get a lot worse if you get hit out there so that's that'll solve that problem

1064
01:44:19.12 --> 01:44:23.84
you talk about you know I walked it this back to the book I walked every square kilometers

1065
01:44:24.88 --> 01:44:29.44
of those ridges and rice fields I fought many of those villages I was wounded there

1066
01:44:29.44 --> 01:44:34.88
and here is where I and my fellow combat veteran stand on one side of a great

1067
01:44:34.88 --> 01:44:44.80
impossible divide with the rest of the world on the other yeah because every one of us knows that

1068
01:44:44.80 --> 01:44:52.40
if our luck had run out or if someone among us had made one in invertean mistake we could have died there

1069
01:44:54.08 --> 01:44:59.84
no question you can be as one thing about you know I've heard you talk about I eat these before you know

1070
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:07.84
I would say 25 to 30 percent of our casualties were IDs most of were gunshot a lot of

1071
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:14.40
shrapnel moves but with an ID there's nothing more to more lacing or booby trap as we call it

1072
01:45:14.40 --> 01:45:24.40
them and the take of your movie in at night the casualties are large and there's nowhere to put

1073
01:45:24.40 --> 01:45:33.68
your anger you know and and if you're on the outside of that you go well you know that easily

1074
01:45:33.68 --> 01:45:39.04
could have been made you can be a hundred percent right and still be dead we had one device on a

1075
01:45:39.04 --> 01:45:46.96
night move every member of my platoon stepped over it on a narrow trail I was walking forth

1076
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:54.000
forth for three in the in a column and the last I had a brand new guy I put him on tail

1077
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.44
and Charlie it was a company who actually didn't batay in him it was a company move and it was

1078
01:45:59.44 --> 01:46:06.48
some branch on the trail or something called boom and you know there were 19 casualties and a

1079
01:46:06.48 --> 01:46:12.000
ambush after that so yeah for those of you that aren't in the military when you're moving at night

1080
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
especially pre night vision then the only way you can do it is you have to be closer to the person

1081
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.56
front of you because you got to be able to see him and so what that does and you'll be within or within

1082
01:46:20.56 --> 01:46:24.56
being in sometimes when it's really dark you'll be able to touch the person in front of you so

1083
01:46:24.56 --> 01:46:30.64
therefore if someone hits a booby trap or an i.e. or you get ambushed the casualties are increased

1084
01:46:30.64 --> 01:46:37.60
dramatically because you're just altogether and to add one thing about our body on that is

1085
01:46:37.60 --> 01:46:44.96
uh I think when we got there they had 140 known i.e. on the board at any given time and uh there

1086
01:46:44.96 --> 01:46:48.72
were a couple of different incidents on one would in particular that sticks to my mind was when

1087
01:46:48.72 --> 01:46:55.20
we were putting in the 17thary security station uh front of mine's platoon was out providing external

1088
01:46:55.20 --> 01:47:04.08
security with gun trucks and I guess he's his truck sat on an i.e. all night and then right when they

1089
01:47:04.08 --> 01:47:08.88
were about to move it went off and took the front of the truck with it luckily nobody was killed but

1090
01:47:08.88 --> 01:47:15.20
it's nothing you can shoot back at you can't really prepare for it yeah um sometimes you got to get

1091
01:47:15.20 --> 01:47:20.40
lucky we we had the similar thing where we we we we're going to a combat outpost in a convoy of just

1092
01:47:20.40 --> 01:47:26.24
you know our shields hadn't to a convoy we're heading to a combat outpost and my point man

1093
01:47:26.24 --> 01:47:31.12
or lead driver someone said hey I think there's something ahead of us in the road stops the vehicle

1094
01:47:31.12 --> 01:47:35.92
we I'm actually watching me gets out looking underneath the vehicle with a flashlight to look and see

1095
01:47:35.92 --> 01:47:41.84
I'm thinking myself hmm this doesn't seem good could didn't identify anything we roll through

1096
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:46.96
we get to the combat outpost and then a couple hours later uh the dagger clearance team came through

1097
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:52.08
and found a triple stack you know 120 millimeter motors that would have killed everyone in that vehicle

1098
01:47:52.08 --> 01:47:57.92
for sure and if not a few others so uh sometimes it's better to be lucky than good and for those

1099
01:47:57.92 --> 01:48:02.000
you out there if you think you're on an i.e. maybe not the flashlight approach you know absolutely

1100
01:48:03.20 --> 01:48:09.36
quite a normal way yeah I had I did that it was my my first deployment to Iraq I'm I'm

1101
01:48:09.36 --> 01:48:16.000
standing there and my EOD guys were doing a target hit and my EOD guys find a uh a booby trap and

1102
01:48:16.56 --> 01:48:21.76
it was in a plan or box outside perfect spot where we're at a salt team would stack up and there was

1103
01:48:21.76 --> 01:48:26.48
a little plant and it was filled with the two or three 16 millimeter motors that were rigged from the house

1104
01:48:27.36 --> 01:48:32.72
and so my EOD guy found it was just plug it into the wall and it goes off so there was and there was

1105
01:48:32.72 --> 01:48:37.28
actually a little hole cut in the curtain so the guy could actually sit there and watch and when

1106
01:48:37.28 --> 01:48:42.16
we rolled up boom and so he found the wire he saw it went out the window falled it out there

1107
01:48:42.16 --> 01:48:48.96
finds the booby trap and I'm standing there watching him you know disarm this booby trap and he

1108
01:48:48.96 --> 01:48:55.20
looks over his shoulder and he says you might not want to stand here and I was like that's a good

1109
01:48:55.20 --> 01:49:04.40
point I'll be somewhere else yeah you know they uh in this area in this area of Vietnam

1110
01:49:04.40 --> 01:49:14.32
um they could become accustomed to a lot of our operational decisions you know we like the high ground

1111
01:49:14.32 --> 01:49:19.52
we like to get a spot where you can see some of these rice patties were like a mile wide you know

1112
01:49:19.52 --> 01:49:25.68
and if you and you want to place where you can have visuals and also provide you know

1113
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:30.56
potential supporting weapon rate for people crossing the patio center etc and so you know they

1114
01:49:30.56 --> 01:49:40.56
picked these out you know and uh we had one hill 11 in here is on a valley where uh you know we

1115
01:49:40.56 --> 01:49:45.28
had sent what when we were getting you strain features the thing you do is you'd send a platoon to sweep

1116
01:49:45.28 --> 01:49:52.16
it you know when you first get up sweep it secure it not just for for booby traps but you know for

1117
01:49:52.16 --> 01:50:00.40
just putting your uh your other uh units and the platoon swept it with second platoon they found a mine

1118
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.44
glued to mine uh I left I was gonna put my lines in and I didn't want to bring my platoon up on that hill

1119
01:50:09.44 --> 01:50:16.64
with what's uh having found the mine so I uh left the rest of my platoon on the bottom hill

1120
01:50:16.64 --> 01:50:23.60
put an air panel on my garbys head uh my radio operator said do not move I want to see where you are

1121
01:50:23.60 --> 01:50:29.44
brought my squad leaders we were clearing lanes down into where we were gonna put uh our marines

1122
01:50:29.44 --> 01:50:34.88
and I heard this kaboom and I look up behind me and someone had moved these people up to the top of

1123
01:50:34.88 --> 01:50:38.80
the hill I turned around to see you guys flying through the air with a big artillery around

1124
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:46.48
and I saw a mugarby and running with arm hanging by a shred he was standing behind him

1125
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:51.92
so we had casually some top of that hill pretty pretty messy after a lot of those things we've been through

1126
01:50:53.76 --> 01:51:03.60
and then the next morning our uh 81's F.O. we set up our perimeter at more to that after new

1127
01:51:05.20 --> 01:51:14.08
and he he rolled over the next morning in his elbow went down and he reached up and it was like

1128
01:51:14.08 --> 01:51:21.68
piece of it will be a sea ration cardboard he peeled it covered with mud like you know like

1129
01:51:21.68 --> 01:51:28.000
plastic surgery so nothing lifted it up and there was a 175 artillery around with a pressure release

1130
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.84
detonator on it that he had slept on all night if he had just rolled over I would have been I think

1131
01:51:33.84 --> 01:51:44.88
they found 15 ruby traps on that on that one hill eventually so what a nightmare and I guess what

1132
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:51.04
of what a good job on him on I'll get the sound night sleeping out all over I think that was probably

1133
01:51:51.76 --> 01:51:56.000
woke up on the middle night on that one of your times thinking about lucky easily lucky

1134
01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.32
um here's here's you're sorry he's talked a little bit about the overall kind of the overall

1135
01:52:04.40 --> 01:52:09.20
I guess the overall occurrences that we're going on were beyond what's just sitting right in front of

1136
01:52:09.20 --> 01:52:14.16
you so here we go but something else was going on at stem from the reality that on any given day

1137
01:52:14.16 --> 01:52:20.64
three different wars were being fought in the basin the first war involved conventional combat

1138
01:52:20.64 --> 01:52:26.72
against north Vietnamese army regulars and main force via con soldiers the second war was the daily

1139
01:52:26.72 --> 01:52:32.24
challenge of an insurgency dominated by a long-term war of a tradition aimed at driving

1140
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:38.80
American public opinion and troop morale against our own involvement in Vietnam at the beginning

1141
01:52:38.80 --> 01:52:44.56
of what became known as the American war communist leader Ho Chi Minh famously predicted for every one

1142
01:52:44.56 --> 01:52:52.48
of you we kill you will kill ten of us but in the end it is you will who will grow tired

1143
01:52:54.40 --> 01:53:01.04
the third war focused was a focused and precise form of domestic terrorism at this point

1144
01:53:01.04 --> 01:53:07.20
in our history America's top leadership had yet to fully grasp the power and impact of a type of

1145
01:53:07.20 --> 01:53:11.92
terrorism that went well beyond the traditional notions of military insurgency

1146
01:53:11.92 --> 01:53:17.84
nor did the south Vietnamese government ever find a way to completely counter it it was sorry

1147
01:53:17.84 --> 01:53:24.16
largely invisible war of terror and subduction was taking place daily among the rural populace

1148
01:53:24.16 --> 01:53:29.52
designed to discredit the south Vietnamese government and to drive a murderous wedge between the

1149
01:53:29.52 --> 01:53:35.84
people and the government and you go on to talk about Bernard Fal and his book you know he's a

1150
01:53:35.84 --> 01:53:40.88
French author who wrote a bunch of books uh spent time there wrote a book called Helen a very

1151
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:51.76
small place and he warned the dick van am I saying that right dick van dick van or moral intervention

1152
01:53:51.76 --> 01:53:59.76
contracts these were groups and what they were doing was the violent act for psychological

1153
01:53:59.76 --> 01:54:05.68
rather than military reasons which is the source of the success of the Vietnam and the dick

1154
01:54:05.68 --> 01:54:14.64
van will simply go on murdering village chiefs youth leaders teachers and anti-malarial teams

1155
01:54:14.64 --> 01:54:21.68
thus isolating the sagon government from the countryside and you describe one of these situations

1156
01:54:22.56 --> 01:54:28.80
there was no warning from around that unseen bend the air suddenly belched and erupted quick

1157
01:54:28.80 --> 01:54:34.32
explosions piercing our ears and reverberating like an unseen blast a wind my adrenaline surged

1158
01:54:34.32 --> 01:54:39.52
I counted three quick bursts of rifle fire and then a womb of three grenades the entire

1159
01:54:39.52 --> 01:54:44.80
platoon became animated tense picking up the pace to a jog as we strode toward the noise

1160
01:54:44.80 --> 01:54:50.16
within a few heart beats a young Vietnamese wild-eyed and gasping for breath collided on the trail

1161
01:54:50.16 --> 01:54:55.68
with the point man of a platoon instinctively the marine tackled the young man and held them on the ground

1162
01:54:55.92 --> 01:55:02.56
we did not know it yet but there had been two others after it's attacked the the assassination squad

1163
01:55:02.56 --> 01:55:08.72
it split apart we would not capture the other two more regrettably we would not be able to kill them

1164
01:55:09.28 --> 01:55:15.20
the district chiefs meeting had not lasted very long we were the first marines to reach the

1165
01:55:15.20 --> 01:55:21.20
hooch I quickly deployed my platoon in defensive positions around it in case there was a second attack

1166
01:55:21.20 --> 01:55:26.64
then I stepped inside the shadowed blood soaked room my platoon corpsmen and my radio operator

1167
01:55:26.64 --> 01:55:31.60
came with me within minutes our companies chief corpsmen stepped inside having jogged down from the

1168
01:55:31.60 --> 01:55:37.12
command post on Henderson Hill their unit one medical bags would soon be empty of battle dressing

1169
01:55:37.12 --> 01:55:43.12
in turniquit turniquits together we began the ugly business of triage separating the dead

1170
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:49.92
from the near dead and the near dead from those who might be medically saved inside the hooch my hands

1171
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:56.24
armed arms trousers and boots had quickly become covered with blood we pulled the dead outside

1172
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:01.36
lining them up in the field as if they were already under markers in a cemetery then covered

1173
01:56:01.36 --> 01:56:07.20
them up so that the feasting flies might find some other place to linger we had a problem with

1174
01:56:07.20 --> 01:56:13.20
flies on the battlefield they buzzed everywhere into our food and onto our open source on an earlier

1175
01:56:13.20 --> 01:56:18.32
morning I had counted more than a dozen floating inside my canteen cup as I heated a mix of

1176
01:56:18.32 --> 01:56:23.44
water and sea ration hot chocolate foolishly I'd bitten into them thinking they were chunks of

1177
01:56:23.44 --> 01:56:29.12
chocolate we carried out the wounded on the dirt floor of the hooch we had found them

1178
01:56:29.12 --> 01:56:33.44
wriggling and turning like worms among each other as they had sought to escape the ankle deep

1179
01:56:33.44 --> 01:56:40.72
syrup of blood and inwards I noticed the district chiefs young deputy deputy who stood out from

1180
01:56:40.72 --> 01:56:47.20
the others due to his fancy clothes blown backward into a family altar by the blast he was frozen

1181
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:51.04
in death with one arm raised in the air as if he were trying to catch their grenade that had

1182
01:56:51.04 --> 01:56:57.12
killed him that hand was gone nothing but the top of a forearm remained its white

1183
01:56:57.12 --> 01:57:02.80
tendon sticking out randomly like unsplaced electrical wires I'd approached an old woman who

1184
01:57:02.80 --> 01:57:08.32
is leaning back against a mud wall with a stunned look on her face her jaw had dropped and her eyes

1185
01:57:08.32 --> 01:57:14.72
stared unbelievably at nothing I thought she was merely in shock I pulled her arm and immediately

1186
01:57:14.72 --> 01:57:20.72
recognized the lack of muscular response of the dead I took a closer look and saw that she had taken

1187
01:57:20.72 --> 01:57:27.84
a square nickel sized piece of shrapnel in the middle for forehead just above her eyes and so on

1188
01:57:28.96 --> 01:57:35.68
as I waited in the muck it did not get any better this was the war we were losing perfectly

1189
01:57:35.68 --> 01:57:42.000
summarizing Bernard Falls observation on this morning the vehicle were not asking for anyone's

1190
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.88
support they were asserting their control for all of the bombs we dropped many of them so randomly

1191
01:57:48.88 --> 01:57:53.52
that they killed people that they killed the very people we were trying to help and for all the

1192
01:57:54.08 --> 01:58:00.48
for all of us enemy soldiers we killed our leaders did not understand the cold focused violence

1193
01:58:00.48 --> 01:58:07.44
perpetrated by the other side they had deliberately killed a room full of their own people

1194
01:58:08.40 --> 01:58:15.12
a violent act for psychological rather than military reasons as a warning to everyone in the basin

1195
01:58:15.12 --> 01:58:23.68
that it was a crime punishable by death to even attend a political meeting hosted by the other side

1196
01:58:26.16 --> 01:58:33.76
true let me let me see if I can I can go back to the three points that you read about

1197
01:58:33.76 --> 01:58:43.28
and just elaborate a little bit there were three wars and any given day I talked a little bit about it earlier

1198
01:58:43.28 --> 01:58:51.44
on the straight conventional side unit against unit there's no question we defeated

1199
01:58:52.40 --> 01:58:58.56
those forces finally and you know people during the war we're talking about the body count the

1200
01:58:58.56 --> 01:59:05.04
body count the inflated body count it's et cetera in 1995 hand-noy admitted they lost

1201
01:59:05.04 --> 01:59:13.28
1.4 million soldiers dead 1.4 million soldiers dead we lost 58,000 the Southfield in the Mace where I I

1202
01:59:13.28 --> 01:59:18.64
really want to say something about because I think they have been disrespected by history they lost

1203
01:59:18.64 --> 01:59:28.32
about 250,000 dead and so we did our job that was our main job the second or you're talking

1204
01:59:28.32 --> 01:59:33.28
about the guerrilla war I think we did well but we could have done better one of the things that

1205
01:59:33.28 --> 01:59:43.60
Bernard Fal talked about was how our you know our supporting arms are we used we used we heavily

1206
01:59:43.60 --> 01:59:48.32
use artillery mortars any sort of things and and the villages it seemed kind of random

1207
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:55.60
and the communist were very focused you know not on the battlefield but how they used

1208
01:59:55.60 --> 01:59:59.68
stuff outside the battlefield they were very focused on who they were who they were after

1209
01:59:59.68 --> 02:00:05.28
in addition to like showing that they could they could meet up with us but even on even on that

1210
02:00:05.28 --> 02:00:12.24
war I mean we adapted and in that area that I operated in you know by the time I had been

1211
02:00:12.24 --> 02:00:18.000
there for five months I understood the temple of that place I understood where they were they were

1212
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.60
where they had been I could anticipate them and we did some I think some really great things by the

1213
02:00:23.60 --> 02:00:28.88
time I got to be a company commander out there in terms of knocking knocking them off balance keep

1214
02:00:28.88 --> 02:00:33.52
in the morale of our troops up you know showing them that we we really we could go where they

1215
02:00:33.52 --> 02:00:40.72
were and we could figure out what they were going to do the third was the key and I will say I

1216
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:47.60
want to see a couple of things about that first you know the the South Vietnamese the motivation

1217
02:00:47.60 --> 02:00:52.88
of the South Vietnamese I think has been misunderstood I didn't understand this one I was

1218
02:00:52.88 --> 02:00:56.72
in Vietnam I understood this a lot better when I got back from Vietnam I started working with the

1219
02:00:56.72 --> 02:01:03.20
Vietnamese community here after 1975 helping them understand a political system that they were moving

1220
02:01:03.20 --> 02:01:09.12
into you know they came they came here they were very they were organized into community groups they

1221
02:01:09.12 --> 02:01:18.32
they knew that you know they we're going to put the future into their kids you know from

1222
02:01:18.32 --> 02:01:24.32
day one it was like you get a job you know but meeting with them get a job get your kids in school

1223
02:01:24.32 --> 02:01:31.60
the next generation is going to succeed but also they were able to explain in a way that I never

1224
02:01:31.60 --> 02:01:38.000
got out there where I was about what it was they were trying to do and how you know if you could

1225
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:44.48
the the communist approach to this was very Stalinist hoachie men was he may he may have been a

1226
02:01:44.48 --> 02:01:52.16
nationalist but he studied the commentary in in Moscow for like seven years he knew the tactics

1227
02:01:52.16 --> 02:01:57.68
that we're going to be used to eliminate the opposition Vietnamese opposition and to also put the

1228
02:01:57.68 --> 02:02:06.08
markers down the the South Vietnamese never found a way to totally respond to this and they were

1229
02:02:06.08 --> 02:02:11.36
constantly getting their leaders they had a lot of corruption the culture is a Mandarin culture there's

1230
02:02:11.36 --> 02:02:16.72
a lot of corruption in the culture of it large when you get you know people in positions of

1231
02:02:16.72 --> 02:02:27.04
powers very big temptation in the Mandarin system but they were saying despite what I mentioned earlier

1232
02:02:27.04 --> 02:02:33.68
about the assassination programs that were not fully understood in our country they were saying

1233
02:02:33.68 --> 02:02:37.12
the people who were opposed to the war were saying the South Vietnamese are so corrupt they won't go out

1234
02:02:37.12 --> 02:02:43.20
there you know we have a district chief in Donning he lives in his villa he has a great life he won't

1235
02:02:43.20 --> 02:02:49.28
go out to the animal base and so our company commander who part of his first story had done is a

1236
02:02:49.92 --> 02:02:54.40
pacification officer working with them said we're going to get him out here we're going to get him out

1237
02:02:54.40 --> 02:03:01.60
here we're going to protect him and they found out about that and as as I wrote in the book I mean

1238
02:03:01.60 --> 02:03:11.20
they killed 17 of their own people in one little room and the the district chief and his aid

1239
02:03:11.20 --> 02:03:21.60
you know just to send the signal that signal was well understood you know by the people in in these

1240
02:03:21.60 --> 02:03:28.32
areas and what we were doing was not as well understood even by ourselves one of the you know the

1241
02:03:28.32 --> 02:03:36.40
most interesting moments for me was when I had a I've sworn the end of my tour I had a marine who

1242
02:03:36.40 --> 02:03:44.56
was getting court martialed and to me for hitting an NCO you would not in my company anymore

1243
02:03:45.44 --> 02:03:49.84
but he said I'm getting court martial like you know I call on his landlight on the regimental

1244
02:03:49.84 --> 02:03:55.36
three shop you know so I'm getting court martial and I don't you know I have a lawyer I can talk to

1245
02:03:55.36 --> 02:03:59.44
you can you come and help me out so all right I got permission to go into Donning I so I went to the

1246
02:03:59.44 --> 02:04:04.72
three math headquarters they had this great dining hall you know that you had to try to get to so

1247
02:04:04.72 --> 02:04:13.12
I went over to the three math head dinner and I went to a bar and this this woman it's

1248
02:04:13.12 --> 02:04:19.36
me as woman it was working behind the bar she had a black diamond sewn into her house I

1249
02:04:21.36 --> 02:04:28.64
and so she was you know she saw me you know I'll droopy you know mustache my boots are blind

1250
02:04:28.64 --> 02:04:34.000
definitely my ears a little lied I definitely don't belong in three math headquarters she said

1251
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:41.20
you're you're from out there I said yeah she's were all you and I said I'm an Anwan she says

1252
02:04:41.20 --> 02:04:46.40
on from dialogue which is the was the major town at the corner eastern corner of the Arizona

1253
02:04:47.44 --> 02:04:56.80
and she said you're doing so much good really and she said she said you know why I wear this

1254
02:04:57.44 --> 02:05:03.12
she said they killed my entire family she said in dialogue her father was a police officer they

1255
02:05:03.12 --> 02:05:09.92
came in at night they killed everybody she was shot you know everybody but her was killed her

1256
02:05:09.92 --> 02:05:17.12
husband is an arbon he was just had just been killed she said you know we you know we can go

1257
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:23.36
places now we couldn't go three years ago you know you are you are winning and you know it's

1258
02:05:23.36 --> 02:05:28.24
first time anybody ever ever said that to me you know and another comment needs to be made and that

1259
02:05:28.24 --> 02:05:36.08
is that the South Vietnamese leadership the military leadership my age there were a lot of really

1260
02:05:36.08 --> 02:05:42.40
fine leaders in there and even even David Hackworth you know who said you know this North Vietnamese

1261
02:05:42.40 --> 02:05:48.40
Lash gun be flying over Saigon by 1975 also said emphatically to me when I was interviewing him

1262
02:05:49.04 --> 02:05:54.16
if you'd gotten these people into position they would have they would have I'm not going to say

1263
02:05:54.16 --> 02:05:58.16
they would have won but they would have survived South Vietnam would have survived like South Korea

1264
02:05:58.16 --> 02:06:04.96
it was Germany survive for eventual better solution so they they have been I think you know

1265
02:06:04.96 --> 02:06:10.80
libeled in in history in terms of the competence of a lot of their they're really good leaders

1266
02:06:11.44 --> 02:06:16.56
and people and soldiers and and reads and that's and that's from your perspective of

1267
02:06:16.56 --> 02:06:20.08
they were you doing joint patrols with them well here's the interesting thing

1268
02:06:20.08 --> 02:06:30.16
one of the reasons that the combat temple went up in early 69 was that Nixon had been

1269
02:06:30.16 --> 02:06:36.000
elected president the the communist were very smart at King in their military operations to our

1270
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:44.72
politics 64 golf at talk at 68 knocked a president out at 68 72 the Easter offensive

1271
02:06:44.72 --> 02:06:49.12
which your Colonel Reader was at his name was was talking about so eloquently in one of your shows

1272
02:06:49.12 --> 02:07:00.88
and they wanted Nixon was going to meet president to in Guam in June of 1969 and they wanted

1273
02:07:00.88 --> 02:07:05.28
they Americans to say they're getting out of there I don't know said I couldn't say there when I was

1274
02:07:05.28 --> 02:07:11.92
over there going yeah this is what's happening but so late April all of May hamburger hill

1275
02:07:11.92 --> 02:07:19.44
and 90th every you know place lit up for 150 people dying but Nixon announced the

1276
02:07:19.44 --> 02:07:25.36
realization it's been mocked it should not have been mocked in the Arizona Valley we

1277
02:07:25.36 --> 02:07:29.44
we had seen South Vietnamese out in Arizona Valley and then I was out there as a company

1278
02:07:29.44 --> 02:07:33.84
committed brought a Ranger to unit out and it kind of got waxed and we actually moved in

1279
02:07:33.84 --> 02:07:38.96
the they're you know to their their perimeter and they were jumping on helicopters to get out

1280
02:07:38.96 --> 02:07:45.44
and then they sent a unit all of 51st Arvin regiment out there and these guys were good

1281
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:52.64
I mean I would have operated with them any day and I've got you know many many friends

1282
02:07:53.52 --> 02:07:58.80
who were Arvin and Vietnam who will talk to you about what happened when the watergate

1283
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:04.84
Congress took over you know in Nixon resigned and then you know this anti-work

1284
02:08:04.84 --> 02:08:11.48
Congress came in and one of the first substantive votes they took was to cut off all

1285
02:08:11.48 --> 02:08:18.36
supplemental appropriations to the South Vietnamese Army there was there was no reason for that

1286
02:08:18.36 --> 02:08:24.52
well our our forces weren't even on the ground over there and at the same time the North

1287
02:08:24.52 --> 02:08:30.92
Vietnamese refurbished and they attacked them when they were reposition that reposition I have

1288
02:08:30.92 --> 02:08:37.40
a really great friend you know who when I was listening to your show that we're talking

1289
02:08:37.40 --> 02:08:42.12
about the American who had spent nine years as a prisoner of war

1290
02:08:43.48 --> 02:08:51.08
Le Cal who's here now spent 12 years on the battlefield was a regimental commander

1291
02:08:51.08 --> 02:08:56.84
he's 28 recipient of their metal varnish and in 13 and a half years locked up five years

1292
02:08:56.84 --> 02:09:04.28
on a connox box he was down to two artillery rounds per tube per day when it was trying to

1293
02:09:04.28 --> 02:09:12.12
reposition his forces when this thing hit so it was a very complicated war I'm not trying to like

1294
02:09:12.12 --> 02:09:19.48
you know re you know re imagine what was happening but I had always thought that the the

1295
02:09:19.48 --> 02:09:25.16
end result would probably be kind of like what you see in Iraq to sort of a slow down and sort

1296
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:28.36
of things out rather than what happened.

1297
02:09:36.68 --> 02:09:41.72
Going back to the book while my mother slept so fitfully and so fitfully dreamed

1298
02:09:42.52 --> 02:09:46.68
I was hit by two enemy grenades while clearing a series of well camouflaged bunkers

1299
02:09:46.68 --> 02:09:52.20
the bunkers were built inside a bamboo thick at at the edge of a murky streambed the first grenade

1300
02:09:52.20 --> 02:09:57.96
peppered me lightly on the face and shoulders the second detonated behind me just after I shot

1301
02:09:57.96 --> 02:10:04.52
the man who threw it and the second soldier who was inside the same bunker I was hitting the head

1302
02:10:04.52 --> 02:10:12.12
back arm and leg the grenades concussion lifted me into the air and threw me down a hill into the

1303
02:10:12.12 --> 02:10:19.16
stream I still carry shrapnel at the base of my skull and in one kidney from the blast but the

1304
02:10:19.16 --> 02:10:24.44
square quarter-sized piece that scored the inside of my left knee joint and lodged against the

1305
02:10:24.44 --> 02:10:30.36
bone of my lower leg would eventually change the direction of my life. Having for months

1306
02:10:30.68 --> 02:10:37.32
repeatedly seen far worse among many of my Marines I did not pay a great deal of attention to my wounds

1307
02:10:37.32 --> 02:10:44.68
met a vact into alhalla and I was treated for several days at the battalion aid station.

1308
02:10:44.68 --> 02:10:51.40
Some of the shrapnel in my head back and arm was removed and some was left to work its way

1309
02:10:51.40 --> 02:10:56.68
out naturally as my skin healed over time the scars pushing shrapnel out onto the surface.

1310
02:10:57.48 --> 02:11:01.96
I returned to the bush as soon as possible but the leg wound went deep into the joint

1311
02:11:01.96 --> 02:11:07.80
and had not completely healed. In the muck of the rice paddies in the filth of the basin

1312
02:11:07.80 --> 02:11:14.12
vils it soon became infected. I did not know it at the time but the infection was moving into the bone

1313
02:11:14.12 --> 02:11:25.64
causing permanent septic damage. And then you go to in August your company executive officer.

1314
02:11:25.64 --> 02:11:32.12
He lets you know that there's a billet opened up for force service regimen on Okinawa and for

1315
02:11:32.12 --> 02:11:37.000
those people I don't know what is this is like a plush billet and here you go if I accepted the assignment

1316
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.72
for me the Vietnam War would be over within weeks and an assignment on the quaint and gorgeous island

1317
02:11:43.72 --> 02:11:49.08
of Okinawa would give me several months to decompress from battlefield combat before I returned home.

1318
02:11:50.52 --> 02:11:56.84
Life's gambles are sometimes settled in mere moments, weighed against years of previous thought

1319
02:11:56.84 --> 02:12:02.52
and decades on the other side where one might reflect on the wisdom involved in a sudden decision.

1320
02:12:03.80 --> 02:12:09.32
I listened to the executive officer and fought inside myself, pressing the radio handset

1321
02:12:09.32 --> 02:12:13.56
against my face as I leaned against an old grave in the middle of a desolate village.

1322
02:12:14.76 --> 02:12:19.64
Those few seconds became as they like to say in the Marine Corps a teachable moment.

1323
02:12:21.96 --> 02:12:28.60
But I could not say yes. After all the years of preparation and months of hardship that I had

1324
02:12:28.60 --> 02:12:33.96
endured with one infantry battalion in this small but violent section of a seemingly never-ending war

1325
02:12:33.96 --> 02:12:41.32
I could not simply walk away. Bonds formed on the battlefield are often as unbreakable as the

1326
02:12:41.32 --> 02:12:49.56
strongest family ties. In a word I felt obligated. Like my father serviced to country defined

1327
02:12:49.56 --> 02:12:57.48
myself respect, more to the point I loved leading infantry Marines. With a gritty,

1328
02:12:57.48 --> 02:13:04.28
Alon, they faced the gravest dangers. They took the greatest risk. They absorbed the highest casualties.

1329
02:13:04.28 --> 02:13:11.32
They had the fewest creature comforts. But they also stood face-to-face and told a tell with the

1330
02:13:11.32 --> 02:13:21.56
enemy every day. And they answered in their honor to know one. Taking a deep breath,

1331
02:13:21.56 --> 02:13:32.04
I finally said no, then stayed in the bush. In September I was given command of dying

1332
02:13:32.04 --> 02:13:52.12
galta. No complaints. During that time I had served under four battalion commanders and three

1333
02:13:52.12 --> 02:14:00.60
regimental commanders. And as you know I mean as I'd say majority of the people who go through

1334
02:14:00.60 --> 02:14:08.52
this experience know there are a few bonds in your life tighter than the people

1335
02:14:10.52 --> 02:14:17.32
that you have served with under extraordinary circumstances. I once wrote in one article

1336
02:14:17.32 --> 02:14:25.56
I don't say I would trust my life to these people because I already have. And I knew what I was doing.

1337
02:14:25.56 --> 02:14:32.84
You know I knew the terrain. I felt like I belonged there. There's a scene in fields of fire where

1338
02:14:32.84 --> 02:14:38.76
snake was a squalier. They got you ready to go on an operation and he goes and sits on a bunker

1339
02:14:39.64 --> 02:14:49.72
looking out across the pattys at the fog pouring down the mountains. And so yeah, that's this is

1340
02:14:49.72 --> 02:14:58.36
where I belong. And my third regimental commander who was a real piece of work and was noble

1341
02:14:58.36 --> 02:15:06.04
back pulled me in. He found out I had two purple hearts as an officer in the bush in which was

1342
02:15:06.04 --> 02:15:15.32
against the division order. And as he said when I left, he said this guy came in with tears as

1343
02:15:15.32 --> 02:15:23.40
biggest horse turds and his eyes. And you know the the greatest job I've ever had is being a

1344
02:15:23.40 --> 02:15:29.32
rifle company commander just enough independence to really be innovative and but still totally

1345
02:15:29.32 --> 02:15:37.000
connected with your people. And I've been very privileged in in my life to be able to maintain

1346
02:15:37.72 --> 02:15:43.000
contact not only with the people but many of the people that I served with but also with the operating

1347
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:52.36
military. And I learned when I when I was in law school, I you know it's where I finally ended up

1348
02:15:53.64 --> 02:15:57.40
because I needed figure I need to screw my brain on and figure out the rest of my life.

1349
02:15:59.48 --> 02:16:04.52
I found out that I could make money by writing. You know it was like the pure formula here,

1350
02:16:04.52 --> 02:16:11.48
you know I could actually get people to pay me to indulge my curiosities. And so I was able

1351
02:16:11.48 --> 02:16:18.76
among other things to you know to be with the military, our military, and a lot of different places.

1352
02:16:18.76 --> 02:16:27.96
I was in Beirut in 1983 when I covered it for PBS and actually I left right before the building

1353
02:16:27.96 --> 02:16:33.64
blew up. I stopped every year, October 23rd and think about that. That was a good battalion

1354
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:37.56
for Spatine 8th Marines. You know you've been around this long enough. You can smell a good

1355
02:16:37.56 --> 02:16:40.68
good unit and you can tell a bad unit and they were a good unit and they were well-lit.

1356
02:16:44.12 --> 02:16:48.84
I was able to be in Afghanistan, you know, as an embed over there.

1357
02:16:50.84 --> 02:16:55.40
Spent been able to spend time working on veterans issues, spent five years in a Pentagon.

1358
02:16:56.44 --> 02:17:01.32
So you can you can take this sort of

1359
02:17:01.32 --> 02:17:10.84
affiliation and a camaraderie and have it still help in other things you do in your life.

1360
02:17:12.68 --> 02:17:18.04
So that was it right when the Colonel brought you in and he just said hey look I don't care

1361
02:17:18.04 --> 02:17:21.80
you're going home. You're you're you're not going to stay here anymore and there was no

1362
02:17:21.80 --> 02:17:27.08
I I mean no I just better but it's about that no there was no you know he

1363
02:17:27.08 --> 02:17:35.08
soon as they found out I had two purple hearts and I was on the regimental in the regimental

1364
02:17:35.08 --> 02:17:39.80
three shot from the last two months and then came home and then I started you know my

1365
02:17:40.60 --> 02:17:47.16
situation with the joint and my legs are acting up at Freigah home and by the way you

1366
02:17:47.16 --> 02:17:51.96
wrote this whole book and you spent I think it was a half maybe a quarter paragraph or maybe three

1367
02:17:51.96 --> 02:17:58.20
sentences talking about you attacking enemy bunkers throwing grenades and getting wounded fighting on

1368
02:17:59.80 --> 02:18:03.96
that's that's the that's that's that's what you received the navy cross for

1369
02:18:04.92 --> 02:18:11.48
and well I just wanted to point out that that's that takes humble to a new level for you

1370
02:18:11.48 --> 02:18:19.32
right this book and give yourself a sentence or two you know I when I was when I decided right fields

1371
02:18:19.32 --> 02:18:28.36
afar I was I was in law school there was a you know there was a very important concept

1372
02:18:28.36 --> 02:18:35.72
of stuck in my mind and it's still there and that is that the people who went over and interrupted

1373
02:18:35.72 --> 02:18:42.44
their lives a lot of them just spent one one tour in the record what home have never

1374
02:18:42.44 --> 02:18:49.16
been fully appreciate have never been fully understood you know and what they did

1375
02:18:49.72 --> 02:18:55.40
getting that down you know that the environment in which they served and you know that the

1376
02:18:55.40 --> 02:19:01.80
there's a when we talk about courage that's physical courage which is maybe shooting somebody

1377
02:19:01.80 --> 02:19:09.32
in one corner there's moral courage which is standing up for what you believe in and having the courage

1378
02:19:09.32 --> 02:19:15.88
to say it to those above you and sometimes you have to say it to those who are who are below you

1379
02:19:15.88 --> 02:19:20.04
you know no you got to do this that's all there is to it and then there's what I like to call daily

1380
02:19:20.04 --> 02:19:26.28
courage you know and daily courage is taken a hand God dealt you and doing something with it you know

1381
02:19:26.28 --> 02:19:35.88
like Tom Martin who was one of my squad leaders was he's now passed away he was an interesting

1382
02:19:35.88 --> 02:19:43.24
I mean it was it was an interesting ear for me in the bush he had been in Vanderbilt University

1383
02:19:43.24 --> 02:19:47.40
he was favor the war I wasn't a debate on the war and this guy who supposedly is going to

1384
02:19:47.40 --> 02:19:51.96
Canada turn around and said if you think this is such a great war why don't you disco servant

1385
02:19:51.96 --> 02:19:58.20
and he enlisted it's a very very smart knowing guy could you know when things would get down

1386
02:19:58.20 --> 02:20:03.40
you can talk talk to me about different stuff then he got shot and he used to keep a you know

1387
02:20:03.40 --> 02:20:11.40
everybody had this simple lighter you know you know with your slogan on it and his his slogan

1388
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:15.40
was life is not enjoying a good hand but learning to play a poor hand well

1389
02:20:17.48 --> 02:20:23.88
and that takes a daily courage you know and we had an harp in our platoon

1390
02:20:25.80 --> 02:20:31.64
had two triple amputees one one died before they got him out of Vietnam

1391
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:38.84
Dale Wilson the other one the silver star recipient one of the most positive people I've ever

1392
02:20:38.84 --> 02:20:45.000
met if you if you met him you wouldn't you would know the hit had lost an arm but you wouldn't

1393
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.16
you know you'd be leaning on a cane you wouldn't be able to tell he lost one leg up by the thigh

1394
02:20:49.16 --> 02:20:55.96
or above the thigh and the other one tumble and he takes Dale Wilson 15 minutes to get out of bed

1395
02:20:55.96 --> 02:21:03.08
that's Dale courage never never complains he'll you'll say well I was going to be in the NFL

1396
02:21:03.08 --> 02:21:10.68
what else to what else did I be doing here macmo Garvey arm blown off my below the shoulder

1397
02:21:12.44 --> 02:21:17.88
we're not got a tattoo says cut on dotted line when I ran for the Senate when I decided

1398
02:21:17.88 --> 02:21:23.72
to run for the Senate nine months to the day before the election zero money zero campaign staff

1399
02:21:23.72 --> 02:21:28.84
I just said I'm going to do this first guy call was Macarby a night manager who took

1400
02:21:28.84 --> 02:21:33.24
season work at lounge in Nashville Tennessee and I said man I need somebody I can trust

1401
02:21:33.88 --> 02:21:38.44
you know 24 hours a day you got to be my driver he says I got one arm I said I don't care you're my driver

1402
02:21:39.80 --> 02:21:44.84
equit is job moved into our basement for a year and you know I couldn't I couldn't have done it

1403
02:21:44.84 --> 02:21:51.000
without him great great friend of sun gyms too by the way so that's that's Dale

1404
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:57.96
courage you know and that's you know that's really when you look at the ramifications that place

1405
02:21:57.96 --> 02:22:04.04
and having people understand you know what how this was in many ways positive for our country too

1406
02:22:04.68 --> 02:22:10.44
that's my goal so you're in law school and you know you've you've mentioned this couple

1407
02:22:10.44 --> 02:22:15.72
times so far but at some point you decide okay I'm going to I'm going to start writing why

1408
02:22:15.72 --> 02:22:19.96
did you decide to write a novel instead of write a book of your own experiences and I mean I

1409
02:22:19.96 --> 02:22:24.52
know and I'm going to get into it a little bit of including there's a major amount of cross over

1410
02:22:24.52 --> 02:22:27.96
but is there a specific reason why you said you know what I'm going to write a novel instead of

1411
02:22:28.76 --> 02:22:33.56
a memoir well there's two things I started writing my last year in the Marine Corps I was put on the

1412
02:22:33.56 --> 02:22:39.000
sector the Navy staff on was on this medical hold and I you know as as we discussed earlier

1413
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:44.92
it was an avid reader I loved I loved to write I was writing for my job I wrote three

1414
02:22:44.92 --> 02:22:51.32
magazine articles in that year one of them was very controversial it was about the

1415
02:22:51.96 --> 02:22:56.20
roles and missions of the Marine Corps how they were on paper and amphibious force and they were

1416
02:22:56.20 --> 02:22:59.80
doing all these other things and it did it make a difference in my bottom line which you better

1417
02:22:59.80 --> 02:23:05.16
believe it makes a difference there's not one marine general on any of these jaystaffs anywhere except

1418
02:23:05.16 --> 02:23:09.24
that you know if if the Navy gives him one and the Marine Corps wasn't even represented when they

1419
02:23:09.24 --> 02:23:13.88
decided that that was their mission it was the chief of naval operations and I was 25 years old and I

1420
02:23:13.88 --> 02:23:17.24
got in big trouble you think I got in big trouble and some of these other things I've written

1421
02:23:17.24 --> 02:23:21.40
you know the chief of staff of the Marine Corps was calling me into talking to me in the

1422
02:23:21.40 --> 02:23:26.84
continent ordered a counter article to be written about what I had said because they were being

1423
02:23:26.84 --> 02:23:31.64
accused in a jacus of you know this you know wanting to start some sort of a campaign you know

1424
02:23:32.92 --> 02:23:38.68
so I had learned the power of the written word and then I wrote my first year in law school I

1425
02:23:38.68 --> 02:23:42.60
sort of looking and I had started looking at Micronesia and what's going to happen after the

1426
02:23:42.60 --> 02:23:47.72
Vietnam War what should the United States Basin system look like in the in the Pacific and I was

1427
02:23:47.72 --> 02:23:52.04
reading a lot of world war two stuff and you know rommel in the desert was you know fighting

1428
02:23:52.04 --> 02:23:57.96
from what he called the interior position you know logistically shortening logistic lines being

1429
02:23:57.96 --> 02:24:01.40
able to hit the brits when they were after him and hit the Americans when they were after him

1430
02:24:01.40 --> 02:24:06.76
and I said we need to develop an interior position in in the Pacific Asia and that's Guam Tenion

1431
02:24:06.76 --> 02:24:10.92
I got really kind of into this wrote my first book actually about that and why not work

1432
02:24:10.92 --> 02:24:19.000
for the governor Guam doing a study so then I'm saying I'm listening to the stuff that people

1433
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.76
were saying about those who served I think I met three people in three years in Georgetown

1434
02:24:22.76 --> 02:24:28.36
Law School who had been in combat in Vietnam 1800 people student body same age group something was wrong

1435
02:24:29.24 --> 02:24:34.76
and I actually was sitting in constitutional law class when they were debating

1436
02:24:35.48 --> 02:24:40.12
the war powers act and they got to be very vicious on you know the people who served there all

1437
02:24:40.12 --> 02:24:43.000
the stuff they never said to my face they're saying to each other and it's class I'm

1438
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.24
going to holy shit that's what they really believe and I started writing the last chapter

1439
02:24:47.24 --> 02:24:52.44
fields of fire sitting in constitutional law class and then as I wrote it you know the first

1440
02:24:52.44 --> 02:24:57.000
time I wrote this book seven times covered a cover in an engineering degree you know and and

1441
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.52
I you know I never went to a creative writing class I started reading the people I thought were the

1442
02:25:02.52 --> 02:25:07.72
greats in a different way not for enjoyment but for structure and these sorts of things

1443
02:25:07.72 --> 02:25:13.08
Hemingway Steinbeck Faulkner Graham Green the British and Irish poets and Sarah

1444
02:25:14.44 --> 02:25:20.36
So the first time through it was sort of like just you know it was very good catharsis and then

1445
02:25:20.76 --> 02:25:23.96
I got to the point where I said no I've got a piece of literature here

1446
02:25:25.32 --> 02:25:31.88
Every one of these characters is a little bit different and it is an escalating moral drama

1447
02:25:31.88 --> 02:25:39.000
in terms of how they are reacting to to operating in this particular area and so

1448
02:25:40.84 --> 02:25:47.56
the power the literary power of the novel was was more important than me telling

1449
02:25:48.20 --> 02:25:52.44
I was there kind of story a head of universality to it

1450
02:25:52.44 --> 02:25:57.64
and a superty who came in to help me on this who had

1451
02:25:57.64 --> 02:26:01.40
well discovered Leon Yeros was that her chief of puttin about one time

1452
02:26:02.44 --> 02:26:05.80
just really encouraged me to stay with it and I you know I

1453
02:26:06.92 --> 02:26:13.16
very lucky that I did because I it the book survived you know 12 rejections and everything else and

1454
02:26:13.16 --> 02:26:19.88
still out there no so uh and and honestly I kind of answered that question for myself and I think

1455
02:26:19.88 --> 02:26:25.16
when people read it they'll figure out why you did it because it does it has this power to it that

1456
02:26:25.16 --> 02:26:31.000
you couldn't have done um just writing your own story even though your own story is is

1457
02:26:31.72 --> 02:26:36.60
very similar and has probably parts that are just even more impactful but the way that this

1458
02:26:36.60 --> 02:26:45.24
ties together and this is this is like a V iconic novel and I will say about Vitnamor but really

1459
02:26:46.28 --> 02:26:51.72
like you could put this over just war and you got these characters in it you know you already

1460
02:26:51.72 --> 02:26:56.28
talked about one of you got to snake who's like the street smart kind of badass marine

1461
02:26:56.28 --> 02:27:04.36
you got Lieutenant Robert E. Lee Hodges who's who's the lieutenant you got the senator who's this

1462
02:27:04.36 --> 02:27:08.04
Harvard kid that thought he was going to play the French horn and the Marine Corps band and he

1463
02:27:08.04 --> 02:27:16.12
ends up in in the basin uh you got Katman who's the the Mexican point man you got the turp

1464
02:27:16.12 --> 02:27:22.44
uh the interpreters we call them uh um Dan you got cannonball flaky bagger rabbit uh

1465
02:27:22.44 --> 02:27:28.52
gilleland baby cakes sergeant Austin's and and all these characters and and you know as I

1466
02:27:28.52 --> 02:27:34.76
read this it was just you know I probably read this 10 years ago or something maybe 15 years ago

1467
02:27:34.76 --> 02:27:40.12
and when I read it again I mean it's just infinitely I mean this is because I'm older and I understand

1468
02:27:40.12 --> 02:27:47.000
things more I guess I hope but just the way that each one of these characters and and here's

1469
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.96
something that I realize I was almost reading this book first of all we know these characters like

1470
02:27:51.96 --> 02:27:56.92
these characters they exist in real life they exist in combat they list they exist in the seal

1471
02:27:56.92 --> 02:28:00.68
teams they exist in the Marine Corps they exist in the army I met all these characters they're all

1472
02:28:00.68 --> 02:28:04.28
out there and they're all out there I work with businesses now they're in those businesses as well

1473
02:28:04.28 --> 02:28:11.96
they're in there these are human beings and and that's incredible and then you put them in this

1474
02:28:12.52 --> 02:28:16.68
you know again I'm interested always in learning about human nature but you put this in this

1475
02:28:16.68 --> 02:28:20.84
environment that is what you've talked about and this environment is gonna it's gonna

1476
02:28:20.84 --> 02:28:29.96
reveal human nature in incredible ways and you just capture so much of it and

1477
02:28:29.96 --> 02:28:41.24
I mean I want to take a look at when when Hodges kind of arrives in Vietnam and he sits

1478
02:28:41.24 --> 02:28:46.28
down with major auto so here we go this is field of fire going back to the book major auto the

1479
02:28:46.28 --> 02:28:51.56
batained executive officer sat behind his field desk and examined Hodges record book he was

1480
02:28:51.56 --> 02:28:56.20
young for major in his early 30s he seemed pleasant enough the Hodges who had expected a hatchet

1481
02:28:56.20 --> 02:29:02.84
faced ravining warrior after hearing of the major's background auto had been a company commander

1482
02:29:02.84 --> 02:29:08.12
during his first tour and was highly decorated his right form was gashed with a six-inch purple

1483
02:29:08.12 --> 02:29:13.96
trough left by a bone-shattering machine gun bullet and yet he had the inquisitive sensitive

1484
02:29:13.96 --> 02:29:20.12
demeanor of a brooding scholar he smiled casually to Hodges so you think you're ready?

1485
02:29:21.08 --> 02:29:25.24
Hodges stood at a loose parade rest in the mustachee to the tent he was scheduled to a

1486
02:29:25.24 --> 02:29:30.36
ten three more days of regimental indoctrination school but he had not found it helpful and he had

1487
02:29:30.36 --> 02:29:40.12
learned to hate the dust filled boredom of anawa yes sir I'm ready thanks so good they need you

1488
02:29:40.12 --> 02:29:45.48
out there lost another lieutenant last night the major watched him closely yes sir I heard

1489
02:29:46.44 --> 02:29:52.92
yeah good old dying delta they like to call themselves deadly delta auto chuckled

1490
02:29:52.92 --> 02:29:59.88
he had a beaten tone in his voice as if he had seen the ritual so many times it had lost its

1491
02:29:59.88 --> 02:30:06.44
mean meaning deadly dying delta Hodges watched him dripping with sweat in the dark heat

1492
02:30:06.44 --> 02:30:11.48
outside a Jeep rumble past leaving a wave red dirt that seaped underneath the tent flap

1493
02:30:11.48 --> 02:30:18.36
like a creeping frog in the distance and artillery battery an artillery battery fire

1494
02:30:18.36 --> 02:30:23.24
emission towards the Arizona territory the major swipe to the fly then lit a cigarette

1495
02:30:23.88 --> 02:30:30.04
as an afterthought he offered one to Hodges no thank you sir major auto side yielder

1496
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:36.44
he dragged deeply on the cigarette frankly studying Hodges yeah dying delta

1497
02:30:37.24 --> 02:30:41.40
you're not ready lieutenant the only reason I'm telling you is I don't want you to panic

1498
02:30:41.40 --> 02:30:46.44
when you get out there and find out nothing in your entire goddamn life will have prepared you

1499
02:30:46.44 --> 02:30:54.92
for the bush not a damn thing yes sir do you know what I mean no sir Jesus Christ the major

1500
02:30:54.92 --> 02:31:02.52
dragged again on his cigarette deadly delta yeah they really caught the shit last night I watched it

1501
02:31:02.52 --> 02:31:07.08
he was almost embarrassing to admit he still felt uncomfortable about the irony of sitting on a

1502
02:31:07.08 --> 02:31:12.04
bunker and watching someone else's war auto lean forward absolutely rubbing the purple gas on his

1503
02:31:12.04 --> 02:31:17.48
forearm well what kind of person do you think goes through that shit day and in day out lieutenant

1504
02:31:18.20 --> 02:31:24.76
because that's what it is shit and that's the way you take it every stinking day something

1505
02:31:24.76 --> 02:31:30.28
piddly ass or something heavy this isn't World War II we can pull you out to Australia and

1506
02:31:30.28 --> 02:31:35.72
parade after a month of fighting nope and it isn't 1965 when we first came into Vietnam we would send

1507
02:31:35.72 --> 02:31:41.40
a company out on a two-day operation then bring the men back for hot challenge liberty yeah that's

1508
02:31:41.40 --> 02:31:49.08
right liberty lieutenant in denang then we started a week long operations then it was a month now well

1509
02:31:50.12 --> 02:31:56.68
we just leave them out there all the time it's more convenient the major offered hotges a small

1510
02:31:56.68 --> 02:32:01.88
challenging smile they go wild lieutenant and there's nothing you can do about it you'll go wild

1511
02:32:01.88 --> 02:32:07.72
too wild as hell you spend a month in the bush and you're not a marine anymore hell you're not even

1512
02:32:07.72 --> 02:32:15.64
a goddamn person there's no tents no barbed wire no hot food no jeeps or trucks no clean clothes nothing

1513
02:32:15.64 --> 02:32:23.24
you're an animal it gets so that it's natural to squat when you take a shit you get ring warm

1514
02:32:23.24 --> 02:32:28.52
and hook warm and gook sores you roll around in your own filth you forget how bad you smell

1515
02:32:29.64 --> 02:32:35.24
dead people guts in the goddamn dirt miserable civilian you know get sort of boring

1516
02:32:35.24 --> 02:32:41.000
you cry when your friends are killed but a new friend comes on a helicopter a few days later

1517
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:47.80
and the dead friend becomes enshrined a martyr to friendship you teach the new friend about him

1518
02:32:48.44 --> 02:32:54.60
and you all remember him it's very romantic it doesn't sound very romantic that's after a month

1519
02:32:54.60 --> 02:33:02.44
or two but lieutenant when you do it for six or nine or even longer by Christ he'll never shake it

1520
02:33:02.44 --> 02:33:08.76
the bush gets in your blood and you hate anyone who hasn't fermented in his own stench for months

1521
02:33:08.76 --> 02:33:13.08
or stood inside a dirt hole all night waiting to kill a man who's trying to kill him first

1522
02:33:15.72 --> 02:33:21.08
major auto scrutinized haggis oh yeah I've done a lot of thinking about it that's something

1523
02:33:21.08 --> 02:33:28.36
a grunt he isn't supposed to do he chuckled again a sort of dry bark but what else can a man

1524
02:33:28.36 --> 02:33:37.64
do an unhoa oh any becomes an oasis you like an hoa lieutenant I hate it you like it when you get

1525
02:33:37.64 --> 02:33:44.28
back from the bush I guarantee so what kind of person can take it for months on end

1526
02:33:45.64 --> 02:33:49.96
haggis felt uneasy he'd expected the major to wave the flag and talk about he will jima

1527
02:33:49.96 --> 02:33:56.84
and then send him aboard the resupply helicopter with fire in his heart someone who is very

1528
02:33:56.84 --> 02:34:05.08
dedicated sir either that or someone who's very crazy well there you are that's in the nutshell

1529
02:34:05.72 --> 02:34:14.20
you just hit the nail on the goddamn head it's been a long time since I read that word yeah

1530
02:34:15.24 --> 02:34:25.32
that I mean it's it's the iconic conversation between the new lieutenant and the executive officer

1531
02:34:25.32 --> 02:34:30.60
and you did just nailed it I guess I'm I'm looking at a route that when I was 28

1532
02:34:33.32 --> 02:34:40.92
now I I wanted there are a couple things here when when I started I said I am not going to

1533
02:34:40.92 --> 02:34:50.36
write this book unless the third guy down in the third fire team says this is true this is real I

1534
02:34:50.36 --> 02:34:57.40
mean you know true real however you want to put it this is real and that was my guide post in

1535
02:34:57.40 --> 02:35:03.80
terms of all of the the combat sequences and and this this sort of thing is you know I want to

1536
02:35:03.80 --> 02:35:09.32
go through this and have it be dear author I love you signed author or the way I wish it had been

1537
02:35:10.20 --> 02:35:14.76
or you know the way I would like to present it I remember when the book came out there was a

1538
02:35:14.76 --> 02:35:21.16
a marine three star general who had been very helpful when I was trying to help one of my

1539
02:35:21.16 --> 02:35:29.88
former marine two had had been out in this area and I sent him a copy of the proofs and he summoned

1540
02:35:29.88 --> 02:35:35.72
me I was working on it he summoned me to his quarters and eighth and I and he said this could be

1541
02:35:35.72 --> 02:35:40.76
a primer on marine cortex but these were not my Marines and I went he was a carnival he was

1542
02:35:40.76 --> 02:35:45.64
over there I said sir I don't know what to tell you because that's his honest as I could be

1543
02:35:46.68 --> 02:35:54.36
and they were my Marines and I don't have to try to make it he would jima to to to give respect to the

1544
02:35:54.36 --> 02:36:00.04
to the people who there but I'll tell you what I walked out of that meeting with him taking oh my god

1545
02:36:00.04 --> 02:36:04.20
you know this is going to be really bad if you know the the Marine Corps turns on me for writing a

1546
02:36:04.20 --> 02:36:10.84
book about Marines and then there was another two star general Schultz who had been a

1547
02:36:10.84 --> 02:36:15.72
batiny commander and been on Taylor comedy was a with third Marine division but he'd been on Taylor

1548
02:36:15.72 --> 02:36:22.36
Comer down here he he read the book and he called me he read it on a C1 30 from you know

1549
02:36:22.36 --> 02:36:28.04
and Ruse to tenulton he called me he said this is the book this is the book I said will you send me a

1550
02:36:28.04 --> 02:36:38.28
letter sir and I sent he sent me a letter and so when I had this little you know command visit

1551
02:36:38.28 --> 02:36:43.72
to General Wilson who was the common nut when the book came out I'm really nervous about the

1552
02:36:43.72 --> 02:36:51.72
General Wilson was a hard ass you know and so I get into see General Wilson my given a copy of the

1553
02:36:51.72 --> 02:36:58.44
book and I said and this is what General Schultz thinks about it and over time you know it's it's

1554
02:36:58.44 --> 02:37:03.08
been mandatory reading and the common uns reading list for decades and I can't tell you how many

1555
02:37:03.08 --> 02:37:07.24
others I've gotten from read particularly staff and seals you know I'm here when I was in

1556
02:37:07.24 --> 02:37:13.88
Bay Route you know as a as a journal Sarah 83 there was a there was one gunnery sergeant who came

1557
02:37:13.88 --> 02:37:21.24
and told me I have read your book 11 times it is a text on you know on leadership if you really read it

1558
02:37:21.24 --> 02:37:26.92
and and at the same time the the important thing also is if you're if you're going to write a

1559
02:37:26.92 --> 02:37:31.72
novel that lasts you want that universality as you say this doesn't just fit not just isn't my

1560
02:37:31.72 --> 02:37:42.36
experience and so it really is a very carefully drawn moral drama and you know some of these

1561
02:37:42.36 --> 02:37:45.80
passes is you're gonna have a hundred many years and I still remember because I've written some of these

1562
02:37:45.80 --> 02:37:50.28
twenty five times you know the the one you start off with I knew the words you know I knew the words

1563
02:37:50.28 --> 02:37:58.28
were gonna come out of your mouth so that is you know that was my intention of with with the book

1564
02:37:58.28 --> 02:38:04.92
and you know what kind of say it's still out there and I know you know this is honest as I can be

1565
02:38:04.92 --> 02:38:13.000
and I know is you know there are there's a lot of rough spots in this book but I don't have to

1566
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:18.52
I don't have to put it any differently the other one other thing I will say is the dialogue it

1567
02:38:18.52 --> 02:38:23.40
may be from the be having benefited from living in so many different places and whatever the

1568
02:38:23.40 --> 02:38:31.88
dialect is you know carefully accurate and like seven or eight different American dialects in the way they

1569
02:38:31.88 --> 02:38:39.64
say words and yeah for sure no you you nailed that it's very clear that yeah you know these people

1570
02:38:40.36 --> 02:38:45.72
you know that then that you were able to capture it you also did a great job obviously of capturing

1571
02:38:45.72 --> 02:38:52.20
some of the just straight combat and I want to go here just to one little situation suddenly there

1572
02:38:52.20 --> 02:38:57.80
were loud explosions across the river the northern compound literally erupted recorless rifles

1573
02:38:57.80 --> 02:39:02.60
flashed and boomed again and again their explosions raising clouds of dirt inside the compound

1574
02:39:02.60 --> 02:39:07.32
machine guns and small arms hammered at the marines the two-platoon perimeter fought back

1575
02:39:07.32 --> 02:39:12.36
red and green tracers interlaced carining into the black air making weaving patterns in the night

1576
02:39:12.36 --> 02:39:18.52
the artillery battery on the bridge compound reacted it turns its guns north and lob

1577
02:39:18.52 --> 02:39:23.48
dozens of projectiles across the river seeking to silence the attack new bright flashes

1578
02:39:23.48 --> 02:39:30.28
hazes of dust grouped around northern compound then a moment of anticipatory fall good

1579
02:39:30.28 --> 02:39:35.24
rich knew what was about to happen he wished he could tell them in the bridge compound he wished

1580
02:39:35.24 --> 02:39:40.36
he could dig a hole in the dirt and come back out in California watch out he gloned inwardly

1581
02:39:40.36 --> 02:39:48.12
to afraid to cry oh shit here it comes right now an avalanche mortar rounds time from a dozen

1582
02:39:48.12 --> 02:39:54.04
tubes to land together on the southern compound then just above the stranded team the deep

1583
02:39:54.04 --> 02:40:00.44
pops of heavy machine gun good rich listen to himself whimper he could not stifle it it seemed

1584
02:40:00.44 --> 02:40:05.32
to him a scream that would give them all away but he finally realized it was no more than a

1585
02:40:05.32 --> 02:40:10.76
scratchy whispering wine the bridge compounds defenders were caught unaware having to feel like

1586
02:40:10.76 --> 02:40:15.80
spectators in the northern compound's furious defense bodies went flat inside their bunker

1587
02:40:15.80 --> 02:40:20.68
seeking cover from the mortar barrage as they did streams of sappers poured through the outer

1588
02:40:20.68 --> 02:40:26.84
wire sliding pipes of bangle or torpedoes to clear pathways through the concertiner for a moment

1589
02:40:27.24 --> 02:40:31.88
they were unnoticed the explosions they created blending in with the mortars they broke through

1590
02:40:31.88 --> 02:40:37.08
both sides of the j-shaped hill just that it's hook tossing satchel charges of explosives into the

1591
02:40:37.08 --> 02:40:42.28
nearest bunkers half of the bunkers on the artillery side unmanned as their defenders had

1592
02:40:42.28 --> 02:40:47.32
helped with the fire missions on the north compound were quickly taken by the NVA the rest of the

1593
02:40:47.32 --> 02:40:52.44
perimeter storm with creeping dashing set sappers two bunkers were lost just down from third

1594
02:40:52.44 --> 02:40:57.16
boutune's last position the sappers manned the bunkers after killing the occupants with satchel

1595
02:40:57.16 --> 02:41:02.68
charges and provided a beach head on the lines a stream of shadows poured into the compound

1596
02:41:02.68 --> 02:41:08.12
between the bunkers the first cell of NVA that raced past the bunkers burned an entrance with a

1597
02:41:08.12 --> 02:41:13.08
washing flamethrower it ignited the corner of a nearby tent and drew bright red answers from a

1598
02:41:13.08 --> 02:41:19.08
host of rifles fired from nearby bunkers there was no second wash its trigger manned and it's

1599
02:41:19.08 --> 02:41:25.88
made lay dead beside low smoulders from the torch lit tent another sapper team quept quietly

1600
02:41:25.88 --> 02:41:30.52
into the center of the compound and encountered two almost identical bunkers and it's hasted

1601
02:41:30.52 --> 02:41:36.12
demolished the chapel leaving the compound leaving the command center bunker unscathed after the

1602
02:41:36.12 --> 02:41:41.64
chapel exploded in detonation that raised a bright bright flash and level the bunker in a smoking heap

1603
02:41:41.64 --> 02:41:46.92
another fierce mortar barrage shook the hill a north Vietnamese would attempt to take out more

1604
02:41:46.92 --> 02:41:52.60
bunkers consolidate then retreat through the brakes in the they had made in the wire speedy's

1605
02:41:52.60 --> 02:41:58.44
gun teamed cringed in the stream bed unspeaking wencing as the gun caught loose again its

1606
02:41:58.44 --> 02:42:03.24
explosion seemed to be so close that one could reach up a hand and lose it to a bullet

1607
02:42:04.12 --> 02:42:10.44
each man knew that if you were made an unward a un-toured move revealing himself in any way

1608
02:42:10.44 --> 02:42:26.60
the whole team would not last five minutes nowhere to go nowhere to hide yeah well you know one of the

1609
02:42:27.40 --> 02:42:33.80
of you're an anton myr anton myr's books I have not once an eagle I have not

1610
02:42:33.80 --> 02:42:40.84
when we when the actually I think I have red wants an eagle it's a great great book you know

1611
02:42:40.84 --> 02:42:47.24
when when when when when we sent the proofs around on on the fields the you know prensaul

1612
02:42:47.24 --> 02:42:52.36
didn't quite know what to expect they you know the book had been rejected by 12 publishers

1613
02:42:52.36 --> 02:42:57.56
nobody wanted to see this side of it and the the other in chief of prensaul John Kirk

1614
02:42:57.56 --> 02:43:03.64
had been a naval invader in in the Korean war it was a Harvard graduate which I I thought was

1615
02:43:03.64 --> 02:43:06.68
kind of interesting because when he asked me to come and talk to him he asked me to meet him at the

1616
02:43:06.68 --> 02:43:12.28
Harvard club you know good riches the Harvard goof you know but he said I think this can be the

1617
02:43:12.28 --> 02:43:18.20
great novel you know he said the the the great novels of different wars go against the grain of

1618
02:43:18.20 --> 02:43:25.16
prevailing orthodoxy and he made a deal with me he said you know I'll give you $5,000 I've been

1619
02:43:25.16 --> 02:43:30.60
working us for four years you give you $5,000 I'll print $5,000 copies but I will put your book

1620
02:43:30.60 --> 02:43:35.48
on the cover of publishers weekly and I'll send you on a major tour I said you know done and

1621
02:43:35.48 --> 02:43:43.72
he said actually the draft he had only had a like a a five page epilogue on good rich and he said

1622
02:43:43.72 --> 02:43:48.20
I'd actually like to see more of good rich coming back I said would you like the 28 page version

1623
02:43:48.20 --> 02:43:54.12
the 35 page version over 62 page version let me look at that I gave him like the 30 page

1624
02:43:54.12 --> 02:44:02.20
version but then they started sending the book around before publication date for advanced quotes

1625
02:44:02.92 --> 02:44:08.92
and he got a tour of them you know and one of the the advanced quotes that I treasureed

1626
02:44:08.92 --> 02:44:15.72
the most was from Antimire he had been he also was a Harvard guy but he'd been a

1627
02:44:15.72 --> 02:44:23.48
marine in a world war two had been on either Guadal canala or Iwajima was wounded and wrote once an eagle

1628
02:44:23.48 --> 02:44:31.72
which is a marvelous book I haven't read that there was more in pieces like thousand pages long but

1629
02:44:31.72 --> 02:44:40.76
he you know he took one character actually two characters but from before we were one all the way

1630
02:44:40.76 --> 02:44:46.52
into Vietnam or that we didn't call it Vietnam and his book you know one of them was you know

1631
02:44:46.52 --> 02:44:53.000
on Nebraska farm kid who was enlisted and you know and got a battlefield commission or war

1632
02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.80
one and the other was a you know West Point guy who punched all the buttons exactly right

1633
02:44:57.80 --> 02:45:05.16
his name was mass and gale another one was Sam David but he wrote really good combat scenes

1634
02:45:05.16 --> 02:45:12.12
and I I I I loved his book and he sent when he when he sent he sent this long advanced quote

1635
02:45:12.12 --> 02:45:19.000
on this book and yeah I just of all of them I went wow you know he said here at last is the

1636
02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:27.96
the real story of those who were in Vietnam you know devoid of history on x etc etc and you know

1637
02:45:27.96 --> 02:45:35.40
it it that you know when when you read passages like that I think of you know people like him

1638
02:45:37.56 --> 02:45:43.40
you know reacting to this gamble you know at at the time because there's nothing out like this

1639
02:45:43.40 --> 02:45:47.80
at the time as it was the first revisionist novel and I'll tell you when I went on my tour

1640
02:45:49.80 --> 02:45:53.16
I'd spend a year and a half on I was working on the House of Veterans Committee

1641
02:45:53.16 --> 02:46:03.08
developing what I sort of a a factual basis for discussion on on the Vietnam war you know

1642
02:46:03.08 --> 02:46:08.68
how long did people really serve how many were drafties how many were volunteers what what was

1643
02:46:08.68 --> 02:46:14.52
the makeup of the casualties you know and those who served etc etc etc etc just trying to lay the

1644
02:46:14.52 --> 02:46:19.72
whole thing out year by year so I went out and the shows that I did that's what I wanted to talk about

1645
02:46:19.72 --> 02:46:25.32
you know I I would talk about this other stuff but there were you know I had some real moments

1646
02:46:25.32 --> 02:46:30.28
and also by the way I had been representing a so-called Warcreminal Pro Bono from my first year in

1647
02:46:30.28 --> 02:46:35.72
law school who I represented for six years he committed suicide halfway through I clear his name

1648
02:46:35.72 --> 02:46:43.96
I probably had to six years but that wasn't very popular out there but I had I was on a radio show in

1649
02:46:43.96 --> 02:46:51.64
Boston in the middle of the show this guy stopped he said I can't hold this back any longer don't you

1650
02:46:51.64 --> 02:46:57.40
consider yourself to be a murderer I mean I went no and actually what I said it would not be in the

1651
02:46:57.40 --> 02:47:05.08
intro and the American Rifleman said no man is by nature of violent animal and society puts restrictions

1652
02:47:05.64 --> 02:47:12.36
you know like me give you ABC here you know society puts restrictions on how that violence is used and

1653
02:47:12.36 --> 02:47:18.44
I don't consider myself to be a murderer anymore than you know a police officer okay so

1654
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.48
and I had I was on a good morning Boston and the woman produced you're so nice to me it said

1655
02:47:23.48 --> 02:47:28.52
right before I go to the show she said we used to hate you guys I said what she said no really I mean

1656
02:47:28.52 --> 02:47:33.40
hate you I went thank you for that I'm not going with the screaming wolf here you know

1657
02:47:34.76 --> 02:47:39.64
and it's interesting because I did a show in I think was Cincinnati which was a TV show

1658
02:47:39.64 --> 02:47:43.88
it's speaking about the passage you just read right a little further in that passage there is a

1659
02:47:45.08 --> 02:47:51.32
a sequence where there's an enemy soldier who is in the what trapped in the wire and he's all

1660
02:47:51.32 --> 02:47:55.96
you know like blowing away and he starts yelling too whole I sorry I do you oh I do you

1661
02:47:55.96 --> 02:48:01.64
you and somebody yelled shut up and shot him and the someone who was interviewing me she says

1662
02:48:02.20 --> 02:48:09.000
how can you put that in a book you know somebody who was trying to surrender who was shot and I said well

1663
02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.72
you know this this is the reality what what was going on she said I want to put that to a vote

1664
02:48:14.44 --> 02:48:19.64
and she asked the viewers how many of you agree with him 94% of the degree with that I think she

1665
02:48:19.64 --> 02:48:26.52
I think maybe we're starting to get somewhere here you know not you know not the lionizing shooting

1666
02:48:26.52 --> 02:48:33.56
wounded soldiers but you know I mean reality is reality it is indeed once you touch them then it's different

1667
02:48:33.56 --> 02:48:39.16
you know and speaking of reality being reality and it's is uh to to kind of point out

1668
02:48:39.96 --> 02:48:44.12
some of the reality that's in this book I got one more thing I want to read from it

1669
02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:52.20
how'd you like to stay in on Ocanawa sir that's right the major smiled

1670
02:48:52.20 --> 02:48:54.84
Jesus Lieutenant I thought you would have jumped over the desk by now

1671
02:48:55.64 --> 02:49:02.28
I'm on the level we just had a bill it opened up over at special services recreation officer

1672
02:49:02.28 --> 02:49:07.08
a lieutenant rotated early on emergency leave he had less than 90 days on his tour so he'll be

1673
02:49:07.08 --> 02:49:12.12
reassigned from the states I have the authority to fill the bill bill it from the transient

1674
02:49:12.12 --> 02:49:18.52
tube been in country already your ideal combat time hospital time would you like it the major

1675
02:49:18.52 --> 02:49:24.12
gybedom grinning good duty lots of free time stick around Hodges will turn you into a whole

1676
02:49:24.12 --> 02:49:33.88
mongering drunk a simple yes and the war would be over but so what everything else and for the

1677
02:49:33.88 --> 02:49:40.04
first time he confronted the truth yes major thank you sir and the rest of his life would be

1678
02:49:40.68 --> 02:49:47.08
anti climax there was nothing on the other side what does a man do when his war is over

1679
02:49:47.08 --> 02:49:54.52
wondered Hodges except keep fighting it all expectancies then lived and if not fulfilled well

1680
02:49:54.52 --> 02:50:02.36
at least confronted the bald red hills with their sandbag bunkers the banter and fallic of dirt

1681
02:50:02.36 --> 02:50:09.40
covered grunts the fearful intensity of contact it was too deep inside him and he had not yet

1682
02:50:09.40 --> 02:50:17.72
done enough to be free of it he suddenly felt superior to the major a creature apart capable of

1683
02:50:17.72 --> 02:50:26.04
absorbing combat's horror without asking for quarter down south his men were on patrol or digging

1684
02:50:26.04 --> 02:50:34.44
new primators or dying and he was nothing if he did not share that misery he stared deep into the

1685
02:50:34.44 --> 02:50:40.68
major's face enjoying the one moment of nobility that his months of terror had allowed

1686
02:50:42.44 --> 02:50:47.96
thanks major but i didn't come halfway around the world to referee basketball games

1687
02:50:50.52 --> 02:50:51.88
the the most powerful

1688
02:50:54.28 --> 02:50:58.36
and telling scene or one of the most powerful and telling scene see telling scenes in the novel

1689
02:50:58.36 --> 02:51:05.56
is the way that i originally ended it which is which is with uh mitzico taking her son

1690
02:51:08.92 --> 02:51:16.84
to camp hands and she's on one hand she's trying to ex you know to to build

1691
02:51:19.56 --> 02:51:24.76
some positive feelings in him about the father he never knew and the the price that he was paying

1692
02:51:24.76 --> 02:51:32.92
for being half american in in the okanalan society and she says was this he says you know

1693
02:51:32.92 --> 02:51:38.04
she takes him a camp hands in you know because he can she can see the marines there he can see

1694
02:51:38.04 --> 02:51:42.84
the marines in air and he says was was a good thing then my like them then i'll be aware

1695
02:51:44.04 --> 02:51:52.44
you know and and that's like whoa you know and then when i was in the senate this is her ironic

1696
02:51:52.44 --> 02:52:01.56
we actually had a situation on on okanalan which was an exact replay where i was able to

1697
02:52:01.56 --> 02:52:14.36
help a family of marine who would deployed to rock and found out that his fiance was pregnant

1698
02:52:14.36 --> 02:52:23.24
and they arranged for them to be married on the phone and they had immigration issues and

1699
02:52:23.24 --> 02:52:30.84
kid issues and all this stuff and my council Trevor Mo was when he was handling us i

1700
02:52:30.84 --> 02:52:36.04
i gave him a copy of the file so we got amazing cool so let's see

1701
02:52:36.04 --> 02:52:45.24
speaking of sons i want to go here back to i heard my country calling talking about as you were

1702
02:52:46.28 --> 02:52:50.92
as you were head north to Vietnam i would soon drive west heading for california where barbro

1703
02:52:50.92 --> 02:52:55.96
would rent a house across the street from my granny and i would catch a flight to Vietnam my parents

1704
02:52:55.96 --> 02:53:01.24
would clear their quarters at angrier forest base and that had south to stay for a while with my dad's

1705
02:53:01.24 --> 02:53:06.20
long time friend but called well as they adjusted to the unknowns of retirement that waited them in

1706
02:53:06.20 --> 02:53:15.32
florida alfa had just begun omega was not so happily done in less than 20 years our lives

1707
02:53:15.32 --> 02:53:21.16
had traveled full circle i was now the one who was leaving my dad was the one being left behind

1708
02:53:22.60 --> 02:53:28.76
there was nothing left to say it was time to go we rose from the years worn

1709
02:53:28.76 --> 02:53:35.40
couches and began to say our final deliberate understated goodbye we slowly made our way toward

1710
02:53:35.40 --> 02:53:43.32
the front door of the farmhouse the radio in the dining room began playing Danny boy sung by jani cash

1711
02:53:44.68 --> 02:53:49.48
i'm not sure that anyone other than god himself could have arranged the sweet sorrow of that moment

1712
02:53:50.60 --> 02:53:57.96
jani cash was my favorite singer Danny boy emblematic of our long held scots Irish heritage

1713
02:53:57.96 --> 02:54:03.32
of military service is perhaps the greatest song ever written about the painful anguish of a father

1714
02:54:03.32 --> 02:54:11.72
watching helplessly as his son marches off to war o dany boy the pipes the pipes are calling

1715
02:54:11.72 --> 02:54:18.04
from glend to glend and down the mountain side the summer's gone and all the roses falling

1716
02:54:18.04 --> 02:54:27.24
to you to you must go and i must bite become ye back when summers in the meadow or when the

1717
02:54:27.24 --> 02:54:37.08
valleys hushed and white would snow to all be here in sunshine or in shadow o dany boy o dany boy

1718
02:54:37.08 --> 02:54:52.52
i love you so it was the first and only time i ever saw my father cry yeah and then

1719
02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:04.68
thirty odd years later your send in your son into the Marine Corps the Iraq war is escalating

1720
02:55:04.68 --> 02:55:11.16
because this is what two thousand three i joined in early 2005 oh sorry yeah it's full

1721
02:55:11.16 --> 02:55:18.84
escalation mode at this point and you're going through the same thing that's harder going through it

1722
02:55:18.84 --> 02:55:32.68
i think it's it's harder having a loved one gone that it is being gone emotionally i think

1723
02:55:35.56 --> 02:55:44.12
my dad was gone a lot i never expected that he would react that way you know

1724
02:55:44.12 --> 02:55:50.84
and then when you know when Jim was gone you know it was it was hard for a lot of reasons

1725
02:55:53.16 --> 02:55:59.80
partly because i was out there campaigning part of the time and this was a very private thing

1726
02:55:59.80 --> 02:56:07.48
to me i'm a father i refuse to talk about it other than in general terms but

1727
02:56:07.48 --> 02:56:17.08
uh he was able to call every now and then send some emails and that sort of thing and actually

1728
02:56:17.72 --> 02:56:22.20
that made it a little harder you know because you're getting a bit of peace here yeah

1729
02:56:23.32 --> 02:56:30.60
we had just as an anecdote i got to make like i think three phone calls from from Vietnam

1730
02:56:31.72 --> 02:56:36.36
when get back in and why you know on these martyrs radio stations where you have three minutes

1731
02:56:36.36 --> 02:56:40.68
you stand only got three minutes and you got to say something you go over and then they talk

1732
02:56:40.68 --> 02:56:49.64
on the other hand so i go hey mom i'm here in Vietnam over i never wear well i got to go now

1733
02:56:50.76 --> 02:56:55.96
but you know getting some of the bits and pieces of what's going on and you know Jim was very

1734
02:56:55.96 --> 02:57:00.36
very well read and smart about that region so he was seeing things even as a ladscorp role

1735
02:57:00.36 --> 02:57:05.96
that a lot of people weren't that was tough and then you know truly waking up every morning not

1736
02:57:05.96 --> 02:57:13.56
known if your kids alive you know i mean that's the unknowns body you uh and unknowns

1737
02:57:13.56 --> 02:57:18.84
and a partial known body you more than actually being there i think but yeah it's very hard but it's

1738
02:57:18.84 --> 02:57:30.68
also our family way you know and so when he came back it was i have to tell you funny story

1739
02:57:31.32 --> 02:57:36.44
they got extended on the search you know one six got extended one six good job we got to stay

1740
02:57:36.44 --> 02:57:40.68
longer yeah and i think there was there was a lot of fist fights going on that boy

1741
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:47.72
there were but in terms never back down from one anybody but so i finally said to him

1742
02:57:47.72 --> 02:57:53.80
an email all right when you get back anything you want he says um Yankees and red socks

1743
02:57:53.80 --> 02:58:00.12
Fenway Park may 19th and we've great great friend and i got a lot of great friends and from

1744
02:58:00.12 --> 02:58:06.44
south Boston big marine cork community up there and i Tommy Lyons who is a random veterans

1745
02:58:06.44 --> 02:58:13.32
programs up there he got tickets and and i know only that but Jim and one of his company mates

1746
02:58:13.32 --> 02:58:20.68
who was from uh Boston they got off the plane at Logan and there was the state highway patrol

1747
02:58:21.24 --> 02:58:25.96
waiting for him and uh like a squad car whatever i don't know what it was but they had the sirens

1748
02:58:25.96 --> 02:58:31.32
go on coming to come to the Fenway and uh yeah it couldn't have that couldn't have been any better

1749
02:58:32.36 --> 02:58:36.68
hey Jim so how old were you when you were like thinking to yourself all right um i'm falling

1750
02:58:36.68 --> 02:58:44.12
to my dad's footsteps early as i can think there is uh two things i wanted to be professional baseball

1751
02:58:44.12 --> 02:58:50.04
player and marine both at the same time and when i was 13 i could friend of mine uh we were warming

1752
02:58:50.04 --> 02:58:57.000
up for a baseball game told me that could not have it and so it became kind of a binary choice and

1753
02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:02.44
the but the re-chorus always at the front uh my dad had a rope hanging in the backyard the entire

1754
02:59:02.44 --> 02:59:06.44
time we were growing up i think it was one day he came home i don't know how old i was but i climbed it

1755
02:59:06.84 --> 02:59:12.68
got back down as if i could be a marine and his reaction was that he could get some sort of organized athletics

1756
02:59:13.40 --> 02:59:21.16
it'd be easily way to wait 10 years and uh when you were when you were going in the

1757
02:59:21.16 --> 02:59:26.04
romati so you you had paid attention what was going on in romati and you guys knew you were

1758
02:59:26.04 --> 02:59:30.28
deploying there i mean just three eight we had done an awesome job and they take i mean they take

1759
02:59:30.28 --> 02:59:35.72
obviously taken a ton of casualties um as had the whole one one AD and the two two eight before

1760
02:59:35.72 --> 02:59:40.92
them and the and the three eight actually overlap between the you know they were there let's just

1761
02:59:40.92 --> 02:59:45.08
like the first the five o six they were there between when the two two eight left the three eight

1762
02:59:45.08 --> 02:59:52.12
stayed the first the five o six stayed some of the other battalion stayed i think but so you guys

1763
02:59:52.12 --> 02:59:59.56
both knew how bad romati was when you were heading there right and it's uh that was

1764
03:00:01.16 --> 03:00:05.64
to go back to when we were announced that we were going there um the mentioned last night there

1765
03:00:05.64 --> 03:00:08.92
was some rumor that we were going to go on a booze cruise there was going to be a reward for

1766
03:00:08.92 --> 03:00:14.84
our battalion having done some seriously good work in foulusia and in afghanistan and there was a

1767
03:00:15.72 --> 03:00:20.60
a fairly i don't want to say it was did you action because that would sound wrong but it was

1768
03:00:20.60 --> 03:00:26.04
kind of a whoa moment because we had heard what was happening to three eight and they were

1769
03:00:26.04 --> 03:00:30.28
in a serious fight and all the units that had been there before them had been serious fights and

1770
03:00:31.16 --> 03:00:37.64
i tried to get as much information as i could about the place that i was going to be going

1771
03:00:37.64 --> 03:00:42.20
and there wasn't much written quite yet there was a little bit about two four uh one of the first

1772
03:00:42.20 --> 03:00:49.16
units in rionson there that was in in print um but in terms of press reports they were

1773
03:00:49.16 --> 03:00:54.44
they were an eye opener all my bluepers in bed with three eight where they were detailing

1774
03:00:54.44 --> 03:01:00.28
and average day of patrol and these guys hoppin walls and talking about the uh the average time

1775
03:01:00.28 --> 03:01:06.36
to contact from leaving wherever you were was about five minutes and it was it was an eye opener

1776
03:01:06.36 --> 03:01:11.64
and and i was a boot at the time um and one of the one of the things that i would do would be

1777
03:01:11.64 --> 03:01:18.04
would be get on a o-gresh or lively and i wanted to find some way to rationalize you know the

1778
03:01:18.04 --> 03:01:23.48
TTPs of the enemy um could i like could i see what they were setting up when they're videotaping

1779
03:01:23.48 --> 03:01:29.72
these complex attacks the i.e. d strikes and there was really no way to do it um you get a 30

1780
03:01:29.72 --> 03:01:36.12
second clip of a gun truck getting hit or a complex ambush and eventually one of my friends

1781
03:01:36.12 --> 03:01:44.20
at the time uh clip Collins worth um he's passed um you know laid into me one night about doing that

1782
03:01:44.20 --> 03:01:50.12
it's like you're not gonna learn a damn thing you're just gonna get wrapped up in a ball knock it off

1783
03:01:50.12 --> 03:01:56.04
and i took a device and just played video games but it was uh it was it was it was it was

1784
03:01:56.04 --> 03:02:01.96
interesting trying to get mentally prepared for it um and i remember for it deployed uh it was

1785
03:02:01.96 --> 03:02:05.96
an eye hotel room with him and one of the things that stood out and as you've all these things

1786
03:02:05.96 --> 03:02:10.52
going on as you know where i'm particularly with your first deployment and a group of families

1787
03:02:10.52 --> 03:02:17.16
trying to be there for you there's a lot of emotions flowing around and he said you know if you

1788
03:02:17.16 --> 03:02:24.84
survive and that woke me up in a big way i never thought that was gonna be even a question and

1789
03:02:25.64 --> 03:02:31.56
it was uh something that was really to me by not only my own father but by someone who had been through

1790
03:02:32.20 --> 03:02:39.32
his own very serious combat experience um and uh as i try to kind of

1791
03:02:39.32 --> 03:02:44.44
rehash all this in my head i was i was brought back to a book that you reviewed on Vietnam a

1792
03:02:44.44 --> 03:02:51.32
couple podcasts ago where this uh new lieutenant was talking about getting ready to leave um and

1793
03:02:52.20 --> 03:03:00.60
you know how he was eating his meal the night before um and there was absolutely no desire

1794
03:03:01.40 --> 03:03:06.12
to be to have the meal to be involved with it his mind was somewhere else and

1795
03:03:06.12 --> 03:03:12.84
the night before i deployed uh my cousins lived in Jacksonville um my dad took us out to i believe

1796
03:03:12.84 --> 03:03:18.68
he was sharp shooters and it's a burger joint favorite thing in the world jeez burger um every year

1797
03:03:18.68 --> 03:03:23.80
my birthday my mom would make a special meal and i'd always ask for a cheeseburger and i got a

1798
03:03:23.80 --> 03:03:28.28
bacon double cheeseburger and basically just stared at it and all i could think about was where

1799
03:03:28.28 --> 03:03:34.36
i was gonna be in 48 hours and how the world around me there was just gonna keep going on um

1800
03:03:34.36 --> 03:03:42.84
and it was uh it's a very interesting period um although he did make me famous uh a couple of

1801
03:03:42.84 --> 03:03:47.48
months later because the next morning we're getting ready to go out and once again Dale Wilson was there

1802
03:03:47.48 --> 03:03:53.08
uh triple NPT he actually walked up to our barracks room uh that before we deployed um you know

1803
03:03:53.08 --> 03:03:57.24
walked up to the second or third deck um nobody could tell you his triple NPT hung out in the barracks

1804
03:03:57.24 --> 03:04:04.28
with my dad uh and us for a bit and then in the next the uh the next morning get ready going

1805
03:04:04.28 --> 03:04:11.72
on the bus and somebody i guess it was a whiskey or a moonshine um you're on your uh you're on

1806
03:04:11.72 --> 03:04:19.80
the radio whiskey um and did uh going away shots in the parking lot and there was a nice picture

1807
03:04:19.80 --> 03:04:24.20
of it a couple months later in Iraq my company first sergeant pulls me aside there's a new

1808
03:04:24.20 --> 03:04:29.56
York Times article apparently about it uh really yeah uh there's a research better than we

1809
03:04:29.56 --> 03:04:33.32
could have read that on the other podcast it was a mention it was made in crazy but it's like

1810
03:04:33.32 --> 03:04:39.64
a really web dragon on the job like uh tell you want to talk to the talk moments when you

1811
03:04:39.64 --> 03:04:45.24
talk about being able to communicate when i was campaigning for the senate and this was like

1812
03:04:45.24 --> 03:04:51.80
couple weeks before the election um Jim called me and he said three guys and he's you know were killed

1813
03:04:51.80 --> 03:04:59.72
and so i'm in his car you know getting ready to go to a football game a big football game um

1814
03:04:59.72 --> 03:05:07.32
uh down in the north like area and i get that information you know and i'm like what do you do

1815
03:05:07.32 --> 03:05:14.84
you know you put it in a box you bury the box you go to your thing and then you can come back

1816
03:05:14.84 --> 03:05:18.92
and pull the box out but you know getting that and that's it you know like two or three minutes

1817
03:05:18.92 --> 03:05:23.000
and walking on having to do like two or three hours saying hello to people and not mentioning

1818
03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:28.04
anything and whatever that you know that was really hard when when he was gone and when i was

1819
03:05:28.04 --> 03:05:34.60
going through that let me ask you this kind of a critical question as a dad i'm gonna come

1820
03:05:34.60 --> 03:05:39.96
at you right now so if my son was getting ready to go on deployment i don't know if i'd say

1821
03:05:39.96 --> 03:05:45.96
if you survive i'm not sure i said that you know is that something i mean i can see why you'd say it

1822
03:05:45.96 --> 03:05:49.24
to you know as i'm sitting there trying to think about why would i tell my son that the reason i

1823
03:05:49.24 --> 03:05:54.04
would tell if i was to tell my son that it'd be because i would want him to stay sharp and on point

1824
03:05:54.04 --> 03:06:01.000
the entire time and not take it for granted and realize what's at stake so that might be i don't

1825
03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:08.20
really remember the context in which i would have said that but you know i mean that's that's

1826
03:06:08.20 --> 03:06:15.64
exactly how i took it yeah it's stripped away the like all aspects of the relationship except

1827
03:06:15.64 --> 03:06:22.68
marine to marine and i've always been very cognizant of my dad's experience and reputation in

1828
03:06:22.68 --> 03:06:29.24
the rain core and it was a very clear message that you know this is going to be different

1829
03:06:29.24 --> 03:06:36.12
you're not special and you'd better pay attention so you might not remember saying it but it

1830
03:06:36.12 --> 03:06:40.60
sounds like some good advice i'll keep that one in my back right there are a lot of words going

1831
03:06:40.60 --> 03:06:47.08
back and forth when you're getting ready to ship out and from from your perspective having grown

1832
03:06:47.08 --> 03:06:53.88
up like with such a with such a focus on leadership and your family and the tradition and your

1833
03:06:53.88 --> 03:07:02.28
family and showing up as a lance corporal inside of a platoon and having more awareness than the

1834
03:07:02.28 --> 03:07:06.44
normal lance corporal would have because i'll tell you i mean if i'm picture myself when i'm

1835
03:07:06.44 --> 03:07:10.68
19 years old if i was a lance corporal i would have been a normal lance corporal i would have been

1836
03:07:10.68 --> 03:07:16.20
you know i wouldn't have had this sort of elevated look at things i mean even having read your

1837
03:07:16.20 --> 03:07:23.64
dad's book over and over again and and just just that level of understanding how did that how

1838
03:07:23.64 --> 03:07:28.20
did that how did that how did that set in your platoon how did that set with you were you ever

1839
03:07:28.20 --> 03:07:31.88
were you ever looking at your boss thinking or looking at your platoon commander thinking uh

1840
03:07:31.88 --> 03:07:36.28
did he listen to you did he talked to you did he know who you were did he what was there anything like that

1841
03:07:36.28 --> 03:07:42.60
they all knew um i think the the best or the most of my time i kept that off the skyline was

1842
03:07:42.60 --> 03:07:47.88
two to three days no matter which unit i was at a boot camp i got pulled out and parade it around

1843
03:07:47.88 --> 03:07:52.20
and it wasn't till i started asking questions this was before they actually kicked off the training

1844
03:07:52.20 --> 03:07:58.92
they're like hey this is this is what's good um but uh i think it it put it extra a

1845
03:08:00.04 --> 03:08:07.08
like extra demand particularly once i hit the fleet marine forces for humility because i could have

1846
03:08:07.08 --> 03:08:13.64
you know all the informal um training if you like in the world and it was world class but at

1847
03:08:13.64 --> 03:08:18.20
the same time i'm walking into an environment where i have not been there and done with these guys

1848
03:08:18.20 --> 03:08:25.08
have done and i need to listen um and when the opportunity presents itself you know then the

1849
03:08:25.08 --> 03:08:30.36
apthi practical application of what i had learned growing up would be there but until you are in

1850
03:08:30.36 --> 03:08:36.92
your stripes you're nothing um and i think i put an extra layer on him no no question about it particularly

1851
03:08:36.92 --> 03:08:44.12
money officers you know and the thing is is Jim has really really been smart and thoughtful

1852
03:08:44.76 --> 03:08:51.56
about that part of the world so he had a you know he had a lens on what was going on that

1853
03:08:51.56 --> 03:08:58.20
a lot of people at his level didn't have did you okay here's uh here's a here's another

1854
03:08:58.20 --> 03:09:02.92
question that i'll throw at you we were talking about a little bit yesterday but um you know and

1855
03:09:02.92 --> 03:09:09.000
i covered chesty puller and loop puller on this podcast number one twenty one and number twenty two

1856
03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:12.20
if you haven't listened to him go listen to him if you don't know that story you should know

1857
03:09:12.20 --> 03:09:18.68
and everyone should know it but you know loop puller got severely wounded as chesty puller son

1858
03:09:19.72 --> 03:09:25.88
you know that that's another thing that would just i can't imagine because you were friends

1859
03:09:25.88 --> 03:09:33.08
with loop puller yes it was and you know you told me a story yesterday about you and him arguing

1860
03:09:33.08 --> 03:09:42.44
about the draft and his his thoughts about that and i i can't imagine that at some level

1861
03:09:43.80 --> 03:09:48.36
you're thinking yourself well i know how i feel i know on patriotic i believe in service

1862
03:09:48.36 --> 03:10:02.60
but this is my boy that's a hard choice everyone has to make um you know loop puller by the

1863
03:10:02.60 --> 03:10:07.32
way i don't think we had a lot of debate but i never really got into an argument with him i i

1864
03:10:07.32 --> 03:10:15.000
want to say that clearly because he is such a decent basically gentle guy you know but we certainly

1865
03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:22.04
you know we certainly had our our disagreements about policy and service and uh and wars in general

1866
03:10:22.04 --> 03:10:30.92
i think by by the time he had never hanging out he was a really really funny guy um my you know for me

1867
03:10:32.36 --> 03:10:39.24
Jim going into the military it's a part of a family tradition um you accept the risk there's a

1868
03:10:39.24 --> 03:10:46.92
an article i wrote for a parade magazine years ago about a father still tending the grave of his

1869
03:10:46.92 --> 03:10:51.96
son and arnex to walk by at all the time it is one of the most beautiful stories about father and son

1870
03:10:51.96 --> 03:10:58.60
and duty and whatever the father was wondering world war two his son uh was one to three times

1871
03:10:58.60 --> 03:11:04.28
in killed and Vietnam went back from Okinawa and was killed and um you know it's called the price of duty

1872
03:11:04.28 --> 03:11:08.44
and i actually mentioned Jim was really young when i wrote that piece but i mentioned you know he

1873
03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:13.24
had already said he wanted to be a Marine you know so you don't want to take away

1874
03:11:14.44 --> 03:11:20.20
from someone what they believe that they they should do personally in for the country so i totally

1875
03:11:20.20 --> 03:11:24.44
respect it and he just got a put your hands inside the box led you know

1876
03:11:24.44 --> 03:11:35.16
and you also uh i know where we're we've been at it for a while but the the one other thing i

1877
03:11:35.16 --> 03:11:40.28
want to ask you about is uh i talk about hack worth a lot and i know you you interviewed him

1878
03:11:40.28 --> 03:11:45.88
and spent you spent like a week with him on Australia no i actually on Hawaii was yeah i was

1879
03:11:45.88 --> 03:11:50.44
thinking i would get the gig to go to Australia but we met in Hawaii which is not a bad

1880
03:11:50.44 --> 03:11:57.48
not a bad guy second place the i spent about a week with him um when he was you know i

1881
03:11:57.48 --> 03:12:03.24
guess people who listen to you know know his backstory but when he was uh deciding to come home from

1882
03:12:03.24 --> 03:12:11.72
Australia after his exile for a number of reasons and in his book had not yet come out and

1883
03:12:13.16 --> 03:12:18.36
prayed magazine could not review books but i went and did a feature a long feature one of their

1884
03:12:18.36 --> 03:12:24.44
longest pieces they'd done on on him and and you know read about him before hand talked to people

1885
03:12:24.44 --> 03:12:29.56
knew him and then got to know him pretty one kept up with him for years actually and he was a

1886
03:12:29.56 --> 03:12:38.04
he was the kind of soldier that if you are going into a bad place you want to be with you know

1887
03:12:38.04 --> 03:12:43.40
he was the real deal and he had a hard time at the end for a number of reasons so i pointed out

1888
03:12:43.40 --> 03:12:51.16
in in the article i i phrased it in a certain way and my article you know i think was a quote from

1889
03:12:52.44 --> 03:12:57.32
one of the people who'd served with him that you know he that the army disappointed him and he just

1890
03:12:57.32 --> 03:13:06.04
decided to declare war on that but he was a soldier and yeah i thought a lot of of him

1891
03:13:06.68 --> 03:13:11.56
that part of his life well it's some of the stuff you told me and i read that article in

1892
03:13:11.56 --> 03:13:16.12
Jim thanks for for that to me and i had actually read it before but i hadn't made the connection you

1893
03:13:16.12 --> 03:13:20.60
know i didn't look at the author's name i apologize i just folded up read the article i didn't

1894
03:13:20.60 --> 03:13:28.20
make that connection but i showed of you know obviously thanks to both you for coming on and and

1895
03:13:28.20 --> 03:13:34.04
thanks for your service and we'll put the links to buy these books and there's a new version coming

1896
03:13:34.04 --> 03:13:42.28
out of field to fire there's an anniversary a 40th anniversary addition that they've put out already

1897
03:13:42.28 --> 03:13:47.96
in the kindle form and it will be out by a say December in in the paper back it's no different

1898
03:13:47.96 --> 03:13:53.24
other than there's a short essay in the front that i wrote you know dance the cover up a little bit

1899
03:13:53.24 --> 03:13:59.80
the glad to know it's still in print so yeah and it's it's it's in print and there's there's lots of

1900
03:13:59.80 --> 03:14:08.36
i'll say there's lots of books and movies and series and tv shows that i don't know how to say this

1901
03:14:08.36 --> 03:14:12.28
but they could they reflect certainly reflect some of the characters and some of the goings

1902
03:14:12.28 --> 03:14:18.92
outside the books so i'd love to see fields become probably a tv series i wrote a proposal

1903
03:14:18.92 --> 03:14:24.20
a year ago on it and we you know it's Hollywood's funny you know it's uh when i was working out there

1904
03:14:24.20 --> 03:14:29.16
a lot i think they were registering 40 close to 40 thousand screen plays a year the writers

1905
03:14:29.16 --> 03:14:35.48
gild anywhere making 260 movies so you know you get to that final uh cut off it's uh pretty competitive

1906
03:14:35.48 --> 03:14:40.92
but uh would like to see that well it's it's been a pleasure being with you it's been a great

1907
03:14:40.92 --> 03:14:46.68
conversation yeah thanks for the thanks for coming on it and i would maybe propose this and i know

1908
03:14:46.68 --> 03:14:50.52
it's a long trip so maybe next time i'll do the trip but we've done this once before we did it

1909
03:14:50.52 --> 03:14:56.92
with a novel mousashi which is told people we were gonna do it and then once everyone had the chance

1910
03:14:56.92 --> 03:15:01.80
to read it we came back or i came back on and i had a friend mine tin ferris who was a

1911
03:15:01.80 --> 03:15:08.44
Asian studies major at Princeton and had lived in Japan and studied judo and we went through

1912
03:15:08.44 --> 03:15:13.40
the book and kind of you know parsed it apart but uh if you'd ever like to do that let me know

1913
03:15:13.40 --> 03:15:20.60
and thank you come back on and we'll go through it and pull you know i i didn't you know

1914
03:15:21.32 --> 03:15:26.04
i like talk about leadership the leadership lessons inside fields of fire are phenomenal just

1915
03:15:26.04 --> 03:15:30.20
the pattern recognition of knowing what kind of people you're dealing with and you can learn a lot

1916
03:15:30.20 --> 03:15:34.52
of that just from the book but i'd love to hear about you know how you got to some of those

1917
03:15:34.52 --> 03:15:39.08
characters one of my well one real obvious characters austin uh sergein austin who's like the

1918
03:15:39.08 --> 03:15:43.96
by the book marine that's hey it's my way or the highway and and just the way you know just the

1919
03:15:43.96 --> 03:15:49.16
way that haggis kind of handles him and and there's a certain there's a conversation that they're

1920
03:15:49.16 --> 03:15:53.80
having and you can see haggis is pushing that pushing back up against him a little bit and then

1921
03:15:53.80 --> 03:15:56.92
he decides oh you know i'm not gonna put push back any further because i'm gonna create a

1922
03:15:56.92 --> 03:16:01.08
relationship with this guy and we'll get him along the way but those little subtleties that you

1923
03:16:01.08 --> 03:16:07.000
put in this book are our phenomenal leadership lessons one one one one small point on that because

1924
03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:12.28
i probably should have mentioned it earlier in terms of one of the motivations in writing and is there

1925
03:16:13.32 --> 03:16:20.92
there was so much out there demeaning things that happened in Vietnam without a comprehensive

1926
03:16:20.92 --> 03:16:28.76
understanding not only of Vietnam but of warfare in general that i felt like it was important to

1927
03:16:28.76 --> 03:16:35.72
to create characters that could give context to how some of the things happen you know um that's

1928
03:16:36.92 --> 03:16:43.72
with with sergeant austin how to you know i think the the numbers um you know when i was in

1929
03:16:43.72 --> 03:16:48.52
in in law school and writing us about everybody was getting fragged you know and i remember i had a

1930
03:16:48.52 --> 03:16:54.76
really good friend who was a world war two veteran um who was needleing me one day saying

1931
03:16:55.56 --> 03:17:00.84
tell me about fragging i said screw you i was raised on stories of a bad lieutenant in world war two

1932
03:17:00.84 --> 03:17:05.16
having ten seconds once the ramp dropped on the landing graph for somebody was gonna get him out of

1933
03:17:05.16 --> 03:17:11.80
the way and he said well i shot a lieutenant i don't know if he was true or not but you know

1934
03:17:11.80 --> 03:17:19.16
there are there are leadership lessons in in in the book and are also in austin's one of them i

1935
03:17:19.16 --> 03:17:23.08
mean how do you how do you create positive environments if you look at where these people had been

1936
03:17:23.08 --> 03:17:27.80
at the time that he was coming in and doing the you know the the preview Vietnam junk on the bunk

1937
03:17:28.44 --> 03:17:33.24
which was probably essential to developing an attitude of discipline when you didn't have this stuff

1938
03:17:33.24 --> 03:17:39.96
but you know somebody you got one point three three points seven million people over the

1939
03:17:39.96 --> 03:17:44.84
500,000 people in Vietnam at the time a lot of them from pre rough backgrounds and uh you know

1940
03:17:44.84 --> 03:17:50.04
there are there are ways to motivate them you know in the narrow ways when things go the other way

1941
03:17:50.04 --> 03:17:58.84
there's a ways to get yourself fragged well i didn't have an often but it was not it it did happen

1942
03:17:59.40 --> 03:18:05.88
you know uh that times yeah yeah it's probably always happened it has and in some form or another

1943
03:18:05.88 --> 03:18:10.12
yeah that's why it's important to be a good leadership a important be a good leader

1944

1958
03:19:50.12 --> 03:19:57.16
if you read them speaking of learning speaking of teaching and whatnot echo Charles

1959
03:19:58.28 --> 03:20:04.36
maybe you could teach us how to you know get after a little bit harder sure first of all

1960
03:20:04.36 --> 03:20:14.68
okay shift gears to jiu jiu jiu obviously seems obvious yeah and I think you're in the same

1961
03:20:14.68 --> 03:20:23.32
boat where you default to jiu jiu jiu has like a solution or a way to look at things even

1962
03:20:23.32 --> 03:20:28.52
earlier today we're talking about true it is yeah it is it is a default way to well I've talked

1963
03:20:28.52 --> 03:20:33.56
about it before the fact that it's a thread that ties a lot of things together it's comparable

1964
03:20:33.56 --> 03:20:40.12
to a lot of things it's a struggle life is a struggle yeah businesses a struggle combat is a struggle

1965
03:20:40.12 --> 03:20:45.24
all these things are a struggle and you have to learn to deal with them and they all have threads

1966
03:20:45.24 --> 03:20:50.04
in them that are the same so yes I do refer to jiu jiu jiu from time to time if you don't like that

1967
03:20:50.68 --> 03:20:56.12
go start your own podcast and don't talk about jiu jiu jiu thank you wait are you saying me shoot if

1968
03:20:56.12 --> 03:21:02.20
I don't like that but you think you talking to okay I'm just making sure I remember

1969
03:21:02.20 --> 03:21:10.12
Akron remember here right now that you refer to jiu jiu jiu as the solution to something humility that's

1970
03:21:10.12 --> 03:21:15.16
what is this all about if you want to work on humility use jiu jiu jiu as the answer that I'll

1971
03:21:15.16 --> 03:21:20.92
help you anyway while you do that you're gonna need a geek because you're gonna do both

1972
03:21:20.92 --> 03:21:27.40
geek and no geek so when you get your geek no question go to origin main dot com to get your geek

1974
03:21:33.72 --> 03:21:39.72
gonna try no geek don't have to use a geek in jiu jiu you can I recommend that you do and if you're

1975
03:21:39.72 --> 03:21:44.20
wondering if you do do jiu jiu jiu jiu jiu do you know you do both yeah that's just that's just the

1976
03:21:44.20 --> 03:21:50.76
way to go you know they both will help each other and they're both useful and but you can get rascarts

1977
03:21:50.76 --> 03:21:55.16
if you're gonna do jiu jiu jiu with a rascard which is a good thing to do because it doesn't

1978
03:21:55.16 --> 03:22:00.52
get all caught up in your opponent's toes yes there's not too many things in life when you're

1979
03:22:00.52 --> 03:22:04.36
worried about your took opponents toes in jiu jiu jiu you are a little bit worried about your

1980
03:22:04.36 --> 03:22:09.48
opponent's toes yeah and your own toes by the way yeah and you can use the rascarge for

1981
03:22:09.48 --> 03:22:20.04
other activities such as surfing cycling you don't cycle I know but I hear good thing okay okay yeah

1982
03:22:20.04 --> 03:22:25.80
well I guess you can wear them for cycling as well and and spats don't forget about spats

1983
03:22:25.80 --> 03:22:30.20
spats which is essentially compression pants you're caught but there's essentially a rascard

1984
03:22:30.20 --> 03:22:36.52
for your legs for your love your other 50% of your body oh as deep into it's a check plus

1986
03:22:41.40 --> 03:22:47.64
in origin yeah it's like full-time in a way yeah stand by denim yep i called peat the other day

1987
03:22:47.64 --> 03:22:52.28
you didn't get yours yet no your jeans and that was really the topic yeah this is a

1988
03:22:52.28 --> 03:22:57.08
shular right critical about that one so yeah we're gonna make it all clothes keep just keep

1989
03:22:57.08 --> 03:23:02.52
anti-tension of that and we'll get them out supplements we got some good supplements

1990
03:23:03.56 --> 03:23:09.56
things that will help you in all aspects of getting after it for instance help your

1991
03:23:09.56 --> 03:23:15.40
joints with joint warfare help your joints with krill oil help your cognitive

1992
03:23:15.40 --> 03:23:24.28
and physical capacity with discipline and there's actually so discipline we just made a new

1993
03:23:24.28 --> 03:23:28.20
form of discipline so there's the discipline powder drink cool here's the problem with the

1994
03:23:28.20 --> 03:23:32.44
discipline powder drink I'm getting ready to go into a meeting and I'm gonna be in there for

1995
03:23:32.44 --> 03:23:38.76
two hours and I want to get like a little bit of a cognitive bump you know what I'm saying

1996
03:23:38.76 --> 03:23:50.12
a little bit of a a little bump yes and I don't maybe want a drink a thousand or drink

1997
03:23:50.12 --> 03:23:53.48
500 milliliters of water whatever a bottle of water I don't want to drink a bottle of water

1998
03:23:53.48 --> 03:23:59.16
because then you know biologically what's gonna occur in 45 minutes if I pounded a bunch of water

1999
03:23:59.16 --> 03:24:03.56
I'm gonna have to quit stop and use the head yeah quit but I'm gonna have to stop for a moment

2000
03:24:03.56 --> 03:24:12.04
and use it which I don't like so made you know some pills a capsule actually a capsule so

2001
03:24:12.04 --> 03:24:17.16
boom it's got the it's got a little caffeine even get it it's got some new tropics in it

2002
03:24:17.16 --> 03:24:23.56
get you a little bit of a just doesn't it have more caffeine than the regular no okay

2003
03:24:23.56 --> 03:24:28.68
so it's literally you're slim on the go yeah it's discipline on the go yeah discipline on the go okay

2004
03:24:28.68 --> 03:24:35.48
interesting yeah I have my took some good oh you got yours oh yeah oh I don't I mean obviously I don't

2005
03:24:35.48 --> 03:24:40.44
go not obviously but I don't go into many people took someone yeah if he took some and he said like

2006
03:24:40.44 --> 03:24:49.88
a text to me and peat and run who's like oh okay so that I don't feel fired up

2007
03:24:49.88 --> 03:24:55.40
one night well JP feels fired up anyways so it's just like enhanced you can tell JP going on stage

2008
03:24:55.40 --> 03:25:00.84
everything's clicking for him oh you know he's fired up yeah 100% so that's discipline go

2009
03:25:02.28 --> 03:25:08.12
but milk the milk train yeah milk train big times stay on it if you're on it it's kind of hard to get

2010
03:25:08.12 --> 03:25:12.44
the problem of the milk train is you just add ends up just being sort of kind of fit this

2011
03:25:12.44 --> 03:25:20.44
or yeah yeah and it's interesting because you know the the idea that protein powder is it's either

2012
03:25:20.44 --> 03:25:25.80
it tastes good or it's good quality that's it that's sort of that economy that used to exist

2013
03:25:25.80 --> 03:25:31.48
it's too good like that did the the the the gap in that dichotomy could not be crossed you know

2014
03:25:31.48 --> 03:25:35.24
could not be brought together it has been brought together been both again I was talking

2015
03:25:35.24 --> 03:25:42.20
my friend Terry okay big sexy last night yeah the milk train no that's the thing and yeah I

2016
03:25:42.20 --> 03:25:46.36
might as well have just made a commercial for it because you know you start talking about it then you

2017
03:25:46.36 --> 03:25:51.24
start saying yeah and you get yourself kind of fired up about it yeah that's what it's doing anyway

2018
03:25:51.24 --> 03:25:57.48
he was like hey man I got it it's good well it's on the malt train hopefully uh mint chocolate chip

2019
03:25:57.48 --> 03:26:04.60
my personal favorite peanut butter chocolate Dave Berks personal favorite good deal vanilla gorilla

2020
03:26:05.56 --> 03:26:11.72
technically named not directly for life babbin but certainly associated with life that

2021
03:26:11.72 --> 03:26:16.84
yeah and he said the other day that he makes it up and he was like whoa the dude of thing he's

2022
03:26:16.84 --> 03:26:22.36
a gay that's milk right he was pumped on the vanilla gorilla and then there's the darkness

2023
03:26:23.40 --> 03:26:29.32
which is just pure chocolate yes and you're in chocolate in my house household the darkness is ascending

2024
03:26:29.32 --> 03:26:36.36
to a really mint chip chocolate levels because it has like a dark chocolate

2025
03:26:36.36 --> 03:26:41.80
okay who's who's who's it's right here yeah yeah yeah interesting I still had peanut butter

2026
03:26:41.80 --> 03:26:49.000
and by the way I should mention that that I could understand but also you know we we also just

2027
03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:55.40
came out with warrior kid milk we got strawberry and chocolate right now they have a little bit less

2028
03:26:55.40 --> 03:27:02.04
protein I mean because if your kids eight years old he usually hopefully get in protein from

2029
03:27:02.04 --> 03:27:07.56
natural food sources the problem is sometimes they don't get enough we got we got some protein in

2030
03:27:07.56 --> 03:27:14.52
there we got vitamins in there got some probiotics in there because we know Timmy when he hears about

2031
03:27:14.52 --> 03:27:21.72
probiotics he gets fired up and this is the amazing thing they are delicious they are just freaking

2032
03:27:21.72 --> 03:27:29.56
delicious and so in my house the strawberry kids milk is just getting crazy I as soon as I

2033
03:27:29.56 --> 03:27:36.04
tasted the strawberry kids milk I sent Brian a text and said make adult warrior kid milk immediately

2034
03:27:37.24 --> 03:27:42.20
now so he's got that comment all right adults yeah yeah yeah yeah adults strawberry

2035
03:27:42.92 --> 03:27:44.84
and I called it strawberry quickly other day

2036
03:27:47.08 --> 03:27:53.32
by your brain when it's like it's it's it literally tastes like strawberry quick yeah

2037
03:27:53.32 --> 03:27:58.60
the chocolate's damn good too but anyways that's a warrior kid this is the only drink

2038
03:27:58.60 --> 03:28:02.28
there's the only thing that you you got with your kids that you want your kids to have it as

2039
03:28:02.28 --> 03:28:06.52
bad as they want to have it there's no other thing in the world that's like that yeah this is it

2040
03:28:07.80 --> 03:28:13.56
maybe the warrior kid books yeah yeah that's possible oh so drinking mountain do the other

2041
03:28:13.56 --> 03:28:19.40
day oh straight up what is up with you yeah just just to sav it bear with me why are you doing

2042
03:28:19.40 --> 03:28:25.32
problems have nonetheless I was and I came to kind of this realization fired

2043
03:28:25.32 --> 03:28:33.24
I'm telling you okay so bear with me you know I'm not pounding mountain news every

2044
03:28:33.24 --> 03:28:40.04
day I'm not saying that but as I drink this slow my it is as I drink this mountain

2045
03:28:40.04 --> 03:28:45.32
do you know how you kind of like reflect yeah I'm listening and so I'm like okay what

2046
03:28:45.32 --> 03:28:47.72
am I drinking it this good I like my I've always liked my

2047
03:28:47.72 --> 03:28:52.84
deduce since literally for some I tasted one of the kid and so I'm like drinking it and I'm like

2048
03:28:52.84 --> 03:28:58.60
you know what I'm drinking right now it's liquid candy is what I'm drinking literally like

2049
03:28:58.60 --> 03:29:03.80
you know like a jolly rancher one of these you know that kind of candy they make lollipops and

2050
03:29:03.80 --> 03:29:09.64
so you know that kind of candy consider this exact flavor this exact flavor not more sweet

2051
03:29:09.64 --> 03:29:15.08
not less sweet this exact mountain do flavor as a lollipop or jolly rancher it would fit it would

2052
03:29:15.08 --> 03:29:19.56
be like yeah and I'm just drinking the liquid form of it literally that's what I'm drinking

2053
03:29:19.56 --> 03:29:25.40
did you finish the candy well it was one of those small cans did you finish it yeah how's eating sushi

2054
03:29:25.40 --> 03:29:30.76
you know it is thank it's the whole deal well that's what it is but there's no reason for this

2055
03:29:30.76 --> 03:29:36.04
anymore because now we have more yeah and you can kind of consider the difference right where the

2056
03:29:36.04 --> 03:29:41.24
you know your kid if they're like how I was and you see the mountain do as a kid you like

2057
03:29:41.24 --> 03:29:44.84
I want that mountain do but the parents like no do you don't drink that you drink drink

2058
03:29:44.84 --> 03:29:50.04
drink drink chocolate tea instead bring a can with you well it's you know I have a bunch

2059
03:29:50.04 --> 03:29:56.04
it's a long story you know and we're working very hard on the whole situation but nonetheless it happened

2060
03:29:56.04 --> 03:30:01.72
and you know we're gonna move on but if you're a kid you want the mountain do I notice now it's

2061
03:30:01.72 --> 03:30:09.24
mountain do it's like a pair of cotton it's an important it's like you say it's not a

2062
03:30:09.24 --> 03:30:15.000
key nonetheless if this will you compare the scenarios kid wants them out to do it's like yeah of course

2063
03:30:15.000 --> 03:30:19.56
you want them out they taste good but the birds like no we don't drink mountain do that's crap that's

2064
03:30:19.56 --> 03:30:24.12
liquid candy we don't you know that we're not doing that's not healthy for us but the kid wants the

2065
03:30:24.12 --> 03:30:30.20

part of the heroes journey is they're getting their gear on yeah suity not you know they're

2079
03:31:52.36 --> 03:31:57.96
shooting up yeah that's part of the deal watch a movie what are they show that whether it's a

2080
03:31:57.96 --> 03:32:02.36
soldier getting his boots on lock and loaded his weapon you know when they're movies when they open

2081
03:32:02.36 --> 03:32:07.64
up like the war chest oh yeah like in like in like in the dragons to open up the war chest right

2082
03:32:07.64 --> 03:32:14.12
yeah in commando commando you're in up it gets on to the shore the final battle scene right

2083
03:32:14.12 --> 03:32:19.56
it gets on the shore oh yeah it was like a whole montage boots uh bulletproof vest uh you know

2084
03:32:19.56 --> 03:32:24.04
I don't know if it was bulletproof I don't know doesn't matter he's dipping it up yeah I think that

2085
03:32:24.04 --> 03:32:31.48
vest is more just you know just don't just you know just just call a wood 100 bruset they paint

2086
03:32:31.48 --> 03:32:35.40
the face with the thing well you know the charcoal that they paint their face with oh and can't

2087
03:32:35.40 --> 03:32:43.96
be pay yeah yeah yeah so I'm telling you to be sure yeah because of that yeah you can you can

2088
03:32:43.96 --> 03:32:49.000
get suited up and then you feel like you're getting in the zone for whatever it is you're about

2089
03:32:49.000 --> 03:32:55.08
to go do you got that shirt that says yeah whatever well big time yeah when you get a new

2090
03:32:55.08 --> 03:33:00.04
rash guard you're that much more compelled to go train mm-hmm if you so this is a thing that starts

2091
03:33:00.04 --> 03:33:04.44
when you're like six years old you get a new pair of shoes and it just lasts your whole life oh yeah

2092
03:33:05.64 --> 03:33:09.56
well yeah actually the shoes that's a good example because remember when you're a kid I don't know

2093
03:33:09.56 --> 03:33:13.40
you might be different but I think most of us when we're kidding you know when you got the new shoes yeah yeah

2094
03:33:13.40 --> 03:33:18.92
you thought I got a school master I want oh yeah you're thinking functionality which I did by the way

2095
03:33:18.92 --> 03:33:24.76
but you get the new shoes the new Chuck Taylor's the half-red half green one the red those

2096
03:33:24.76 --> 03:33:29.96
of anyway we had those and so you buy them or you get them whatever from parents and you're like

2097
03:33:29.96 --> 03:33:35.72
can't wait to just wear these to school oh and like everyone's gonna see you know all this stuff so

2098
03:33:36.68 --> 03:33:41.48
compared to if you don't have new shoes do you really want to go to school sure maybe maybe not

2099
03:33:41.48 --> 03:33:46.92
but with the Chuck Taylor news shoes you will want to go that's how same thing with the gym the same

2100
03:33:46.92 --> 03:33:51.96
thing with anywhere if you got some new clothing to represent with big time Chuck do you wear

2101
03:33:51.96 --> 03:33:57.40
drive drive fit is I think it's what it's called you wear dry fit right in what like a shirt

2102
03:33:57.40 --> 03:34:01.88
way it's called dry fit for like working out yeah yeah yeah yeah so we don't have any of that

2103
03:34:03.08 --> 03:34:06.92
we need to I know that's what I just thought of right now you just thought about here's the thing

2104
03:34:06.92 --> 03:34:11.48
I knew that before because you I think you and some people actually on said that I'm working on

2105
03:34:11.48 --> 03:34:19.96
we're working on it we're working on an origin that we can make dry fit not a compression like loose fit

2106
03:34:19.96 --> 03:34:25.80
right loose fit loose fit quick dry that's what we're making yeah that's a pretty dope red one

2107
03:34:25.80 --> 03:34:31.96
at the monster and I was like I don't wear dry fit at all I put it on I was like dang I like it is good

2108
03:34:32.84 --> 03:34:37.80
boom it's kind of on my radar now yeah well I think you measure most shirts by their sleeve size

2109
03:34:37.80 --> 03:34:43.000
so I think I said some small sleeves and you're stoked that's right anyway

2110
03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:47.80
Chuck also stay on the path keep stay on the path keep yourself on the path

2136
03:37:16.20 --> 03:37:21.16
sure when walls are exploding yeah might be a little bit beyond but sometimes he goes a little too far

2137
03:37:21.16 --> 03:37:25.96
let him know but no if his videos are a little bit much ship he learns it's like the guy that

2138
03:37:25.96 --> 03:37:30.60
learns something and they learn the cowbell they get a new cowbell for the drum set and they put it

2139
03:37:30.60 --> 03:37:37.08
into the whole album it's just cowbell what's the cowbell it's a cowbell i mean but people use it

2140
03:37:37.08 --> 03:37:43.24
in music occasionally it should be used sparingly so it's a real actual cowbell okay thing okay

2141
03:37:43.24 --> 03:37:49.08
like more like a bomb okay i can't really do noise sure but they're because in dress or she

2142
03:37:49.08 --> 03:37:55.08
drums actually all instruments really they have like names for you know like hi hat yeah there's

2143
03:37:55.08 --> 03:37:59.000
the name of the drum i know but see what i'm saying though that's like a name for a drum like

2144
03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:02.68
if you'd never seen a drum or never heard of a drum song says hi hat they'd be like i know

2145
03:38:02.68 --> 03:38:07.24
what hi means and i know what hat means but hi hat is the name for you seem to think i thought

2146
03:38:07.24 --> 03:38:12.68
that was the same deal for cowbell no no it's it's actually how they make i mean i don't know what the

2147
03:38:12.68 --> 03:38:20.04
cowbell's look like in 1850 but this is definitely been cleaned up and modified so it's a cowbell

2148
03:38:20.04 --> 03:38:25.88
looking thing but it's for your you don't you don't go to the farm store to buy a cowbell for your

2149
03:38:25.88 --> 03:38:31.80
drum set okay go to the music store you say i need a cowbell i understand and then you start

2150
03:38:31.80 --> 03:38:36.12
using it and every song and you think everyone wants to just hear that cowbell yeah yeah because you

2183
03:41:42.52 --> 03:41:47.48
imagine you're you read a book and you're seven years old nine years old and you decided that

2184
03:41:47.48 --> 03:41:51.000
the book was good enough that you were gonna try and find the author who lives on the other side of

03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:55.56
the world and write them a note and say thanks because i'm on the path now that's the book right there

2189
03:42:14.36 --> 03:42:21.80

2190
03:42:21.80 --> 03:42:28.76
crush you or yes you're right or that could if that well i guess if they're it depends on

2191
03:42:28.76 --> 03:42:34.20
their level of of malevolence in their soul because if they have a little bit of good in there

2192
03:42:34.20 --> 03:42:38.20
you know what they're gonna do they're gonna read that little part about laughter wins and they're

2193
03:42:38.20 --> 03:42:41.08
gonna see that the light is gonna overcome the darkness and maybe they'll come back to you

2194
03:42:41.08 --> 03:42:46.60
in 18 months and like hey i got you something boom and now we're not enemies anymore we're moving

2195
03:42:46.60 --> 03:42:51.32

2196
03:42:51.32 --> 03:42:55.64
you know by the way do you want to go out eat some steak because i'm down yeah so that might

2197
03:42:55.64 --> 03:42:59.16
actually be the move really yeah that could be the move nice the done i like the way you think

2198
03:42:59.80 --> 03:43:09.000
that audio book is not on audible it is on iTunes Amazon music google play other MP3 platforms

2200
03:43:16.20 --> 03:43:21.32
taking the principles that we used in combat and then applying them to business and life and then we

2201
03:43:21.32 --> 03:43:27.000
followed that up with another book called the dichotomy of leadership another New York times best

2202
03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:33.000
hell which is super cool and all that but whatever let's face it what we wanted to do was write a book

2203
03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:38.44
that actually expanded and made people better leaders feedback we're getting on that one is

2204
03:43:38.44 --> 03:43:43.000
that's when it's helping people do the little the little nuances of extreme ownership that are

2205
03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:49.96
that are harder to handle and harder to master this book will help you do it that the dichotomy

2206
03:43:49.96 --> 03:43:54.92
of leadership available everywhere appreciate everyone getting that of course now we have Mikey

2208
03:44:03.80 --> 03:44:11.80

2209
03:44:11.80 --> 03:44:18.12
scared of everything and he finds a book and in the book the king is dead in this village and

2210
03:44:18.12 --> 03:44:25.24
this kingdom and there's a prince that's gonna have to stand up and fight so that's what he

2211
03:44:25.24 --> 03:44:29.16
that's what he does the princess is to stand up and fight but he's scared because he's only seven so

2212
03:44:29.16 --> 03:44:38.76
that's that little little exor permit little expert exor the king had always been so strong and

2213
03:44:38.76 --> 03:44:44.60
brave and protected the kingdom from the dragon cave the dragon cave was just over the hill

2214
03:44:44.60 --> 03:44:50.60
and filled with scary creatures that were ready to kill horrible dragons of every single type

2215
03:44:50.60 --> 03:44:55.88
who thought people in the kingdom were especially ripe the people thought the dragons had breath of

2216
03:44:55.88 --> 03:45:01.72
fire and that the dragon stood 20 feet tall or higher they fought the dragons had sword stopping

2217
03:45:01.72 --> 03:45:09.000
scales and powerful long razor sharp tails but the brave king never let the beast around

2218
03:45:09.88 --> 03:45:15.80
he stood up and fought and held his ground and as long as the king had been the king none of the

2219
03:45:15.80 --> 03:45:22.76
dragons could do a thing yes the king always kept the dragons at bay by going out bravely into the

2220
03:45:22.76 --> 03:45:28.68
fray it seemed without fear the king would go fight he'd beat the dragons and come home at night

2221
03:45:28.68 --> 03:45:34.68
but now that the king had died and was gone there was only one person to fight and carry on

2222
03:45:35.40 --> 03:45:40.12
but that person wasn't bigger mightier strong in fact he hadn't been alive that long

2223
03:45:40.12 --> 03:45:46.36
now the person who had dragons to chase was just a little boy with a smiling face yes the

2224
03:45:46.36 --> 03:45:53.96
person that now must stand up and be bold was just the little prince who is only seven years old so

2225
03:45:53.96 --> 03:45:58.28
so there you go of course the villagers are worried if this little kid's gonna be able to do it

2226
03:45:58.92 --> 03:46:04.28
and well get the book you find out what happens when he goes up to face the dragons

2232
03:46:37.72 --> 03:46:44.12

2233
03:46:44.92 --> 03:46:49.40
