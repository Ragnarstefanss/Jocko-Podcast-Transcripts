00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocopotcast number 174 with echo Charles and me, Jocco-Willink. Good evening echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I was the commander of the training detachment, which runs the tactical kind of advanced training for the West Coast seal teams.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And when I was in that position, one of the things that you have to do when you're in a leadership position is you have to give evaluations for everyone that works for you.

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If to basically write down and evaluate how good they are and how well they do their job.

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is normal for everyone in the Navy and everyone in the military really.

6
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And in the Navy it's a 5.0 system that you're getting great and so 5.0 is the best and 1.0 is the worst.

7
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't know if you can go lower than that you probably can but there are rules about how many people you can put at the top.

8
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You have to, it's called forced ranking. If you've heard of that, forced ranking means you have to actually rank everyone.

9
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So if you have 10 people working for you, you have to rank this is my number one guy, this is my number two guy all the way down through number 10.

10
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so what you cannot do is you can't just say, hey everyone's great, everyone's a 5.0.

11
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That's, that's, you're not allowed to do that.

12
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And believe it or not, that's what people would do.

13
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Most people would just, they have to evaluate someone, guess what they say, hey you're great, everything great.

14
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And you wouldn't think that the military, right, the military would have a hard time telling people like hey here's some areas where you need to improve.

15
00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You wouldn't think that the military, especially like the seal teams, you know the big tough seal is going to have a hard time telling someone hey this is where your performance is could be better, right?

16
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But actually no one likes having those hard conversations, I should say just about no one likes having those hard conversations.

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And in fact, this is completely evident in the fact that there was an old evaluation system when I first got into the Navy.

18
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And there, you didn't have to force rank, you could just make everyone perfect, basically on paper and that's actually what happened.

19
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
That system was a four point O system, so it was a four point O was the highest that you could get.

20
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And everyone was a four point O guy.

21
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Everyone got four point O's in everything.

22
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And actually I have to take that back.

23
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I think I might have talked about this before, but my first evaluation that I got at a seal team, I wasn't even an opportune yet,

24
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I was going through the initial training that you used to do to seal team.

25
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
When you got to the seal team, you did something called STT, which was stood for seal tactical training and it basically taught you the little bit more advanced skills than you learned in Buds.

26
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And I got a four point O and everything, but I actually got a three point eight in a category called human relations.

27
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And I was, I guess, you know, I talked to my friends, they knew we got four point O and everything and everyone got four point O except for me.

28
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I got the three point eight.

29
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so then you're supposed to get a counseling, right, from, and the officer that had written my,

30
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the officer that had written my evaluation and given me all four point O, four point O and tactics, four point O and that's four point O and the other thing.

31
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And then a three point eight in human relations.

32
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And he had to count some, he said, you have to do you have to go through and make sure that no one objects.

33
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And he looked at me and he said, you know, I, I give you a three point eight in, you know, in human relations because.

34
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Well, because I think you're a little too hard on people that are, that are unsat.

35
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I kind of took pride in that, you know, because I, at that time, I wasn't really playing the game, you know.

36
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
You know, I kind of was thinking to myself, yeah, I, that's right, you know, if you're unsat, I am going to be hard on you.

37
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And you can probably guess of the group that I was in, which individual I was harger on the nanny of one else was actually that guy.

38
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So that was kind of funny, but, you know, after that, after I got into a suit, tuned in, all, you know, everything was four point O all the time.

39
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Again, I'm not bragging at all about that because every single guy we all had four point O's across the board on everything and everyone was the best seal in the seal teams ever in the history of ever.

40
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
That's what it was like.

41
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And everyone was, that's just the way was everyone was the best. So the nanny realizes.

42
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Basically, the nanny realized that all the leaders were cowards.

43
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And when it came to telling the truth to the troops about where they stood and where they could improve. So they made, they made a change.

44
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
They made the drastic change to the evaluation and they changed this thing called forced ranking.

45
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Where, whatever there was percentages on how many people could be ranked at the highest level.

46
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Like it was like 10% of your people could be ranked at the highest level and then 20% of the next tier.

47
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And it went on down the line. You didn't actually have to rank someone as bad, but you couldn't rank a bunch of people at the top.

48
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And it was, it actually made a big difference all of a sudden.

49
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Because now all of a sudden you had to, if you were in a leadership position, you had to give some of your people some lower rankings.

50
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And you actually had to figure out who is better.

51
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And,

52
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
eventually what they did is, again, people not wanting to have hard conversations. Eventually what they did is because

53
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
How you advance in the navy is based on your evaluations, what's what we're talking about.

54
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But it's also based on how much time you have in grade. So you can't, if you make, if you're in E4,

55
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you can't make E5 for 3 years or there's some random number. Like you cannot make E5 for 3 years.

56
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And so what they started doing is just ranking you based on how long you were there for. And so, that's what they started doing.

57
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So basically it didn't really help.

58
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Because you still ended up just saying, oh well, you're just new and that's why you didn't get promoted.

59
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Why didn't really understand that?

60
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
When the very first of the forced ranking evaluations came out, I had just made E5.

61
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And because I just made E5, I got ranked at the bottom of the E5s in my platoon.

62
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And like I said at this time, I wasn't really playing the game really fully.

63
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So I was kind of went to my chief and my lieutenant with, hey, why am I, why am I at the bottom?

64
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
How, how can I be the lowest ranking of the E5s? Because that's just wrong.

65
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What about this guy here? You know, what about this guy over here?

66
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You tell me that this guy is doing a better job than I am because I was working really hard and doing a good job.

67
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And they didn't disagree with me.

68
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
What they said is like, look, yes, jockel, you're definitely doing a better job than that guy in that guy.

69
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
But here's the deal. They're up for promotion. And you're not.

70
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And when you're up for promotion, you'll be at the top when you're turned.

71
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And again, I wasn't really playing the game. So I said, oh, okay, you know, I get it.

72
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Why didn't you just tell me that work on me, Nests? Is what was wrong? It's going on there.

73
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And, you know, there, no, we're not communists. It's just, you know, this is just the way that the system organized.

74
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Okay, so what you're telling is this is a communist system. Is what's happening?

75
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Thanks, Comrade.

76
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And of course, they did their best to explain it to me.

77
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I didn't really listen because like I said, don't, wasn't really playing the game at this time.

78
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Let's be young. You know, E5 getting after it.

79
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But eventually, it was me that was evaluating people and force ranking them.

80
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And then it was me that was explaining the rules of why people got ranked, where they got ranked,

81
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and why I gave them the grades that I gave them.

82
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And, of course, I did this a bunch from when I was in assistant,

83
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
put in commander and a put in commander and a task unit commander.

84
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So I had done this a bunch. And now I was the officer in charge of the training

85
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to the academy. And I had one of the guys that didn't like where he got ranked.

86
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
He didn't like it. He thought he deserved higher.

87
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And he thought he deserved a bunch of five hosts that the highest possible grade.

88
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And, you know, maybe not on all the criteria, but on some of them.

89
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And he actually requested an office call with me, meaning he wanted to come and talk to me,

90
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
which was kind of weird because at this time,

91
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
people literally would just walk in my office all the time.

92
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And, you know, say, hey, what's up? I got to, you know, they were talking about something.

93
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I was super casual about people coming from Seemey. No, no fact, right?

94
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So in this guy went and actually organized an official meeting with me.

95
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I was totally cool with it, but it was weird.

96
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And he came in and he had his evaluation with him and he put it on my desk.

97
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And, you know, he said something along the lines of,

98
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
you know, I got ranked in the middle of the pack and how did this happen?

99
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And I should be at the top or at least I should be near it.

100
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And I should have five hosts and, you know, this category and that category and this other category.

101
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And the guy himself, he wasn't a slacker by any stretch imagination.

102
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
He was a good, really solid, seal.

103
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
He wasn't like an over the top outstanding front runner,

104
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
but he was really, really solid, which you only allowed to have a very small number.

105
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Guys that you're ranking as front runners.

106
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And he wasn't there.

107
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And, you know, I was better at this point at playing the game.

108
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You know, up and down the chain of command.

109
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And so what I did is I sat there and I listened to him and I listened to his perspective.

110
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And as I was doing that, as I was listening to this guy,

111
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
you know, it's thinking myself, you know, this guy's a hardworking seal.

112
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
He thinks he should have higher grades across the board.

113
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
He thinks he should be a top rank guy with five pointos.

114
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And as I'm sitting there listening to him, I'm thinking,

115
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
why does he actually think that?

116
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Why does he think that?

117
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
What is going on in his head that he thinks that he should be a five pointo?

118
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And of course, I'm thinking to myself, this is somehow my fault.

119
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
This is going to be my fault because I'm the leader and I have a guy.

120
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I have a guy that's concerned enough about his rankings that he's in here talking to me.

121
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
He actually set an appointment to come and talk to me about this.

122
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So obviously, I had not done a good job at this point of explaining things to him.

123
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And if he doesn't get it, obviously there's going to be more people that think the same way.

124
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Then, you know, he's not the only one.

125
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
When someone comes to you the problem, they're not the only one.

126
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So that's what I'm thinking.

127
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And I'm thinking that he's thinking he's a five pointo.

128
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
That's what he's thinking.

129
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
He's thinking he's a five pointo.

130
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And he's not.

131
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And he thinks he should be.

132
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And then I'm trying to figure out I'm thinking to myself,

133
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Okay, how do I explain to him where he is missing the mark?

134
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
How can I explain to him that he's not quite a five pointo?

135
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Because five pointo is outstanding.

136
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And then the answer kind of jumped out at me.

137
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The answer was the evaluation form itself.

138
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
That's what it was.

139
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Because the evaluation form itself actually gives the definition of what a five pointo

140
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Sailor is.

141
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
What a five pointo leader is.

142
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And really when you break it down, what a five pointo human being is the evaluation actually spells it out

143
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in plain English.

144
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So I picked up the evaluation form that he had brought in.

145
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And I started to read chunks of it to him.

146
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So the first little chunk that I read to read to him.

147
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
There's a section called professional knowledge.

148
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And if you are a five pointo in professional knowledge, it gives you a list of what you are.

149
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And here's what it says.

150
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
If you're a five pointo in professional knowledge, this is what it says.

151
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Recognized expert sought out by all for technical knowledge.

152
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Use his knowledge to solve complex technical problems.

153
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Meets advancement requirements early and with distinction.

154
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So you know, I looked at him and said, okay, recognized expert.

155
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Are you a recognized expert?

156
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Does how often are you getting called by the East Coast or by the seal team to help them solve a problem?

157
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
The answer was he's not.

158
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
He's a good solid guy.

159
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Really good instructor.

160
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He's not a.

161
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
He's not a recognized expert.

162
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And he knew it.

163
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And then I read the the three pointo, which is a middle grade.

164
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Like, hey, this is your average situation.

165
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I said, it may be this is you.

166
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I said, listen, strong working knowledge of rating, specialty, and job.

167
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Reliably applies knowledge to accomplish tasks.

168
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Meets advancement requirements on time.

169
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is a solid human being, right?

170
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
This is a solid.

171
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
That's a three pointo right there.

172
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And again, as I'm reading to this, this guy, yeah, he had strong working knowledge.

173
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
For sure.

174
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
He was applying that knowledge to his job.

175
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
For sure.

176
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
He was doing that.

177
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So that's cool.

178
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That's three pointo.

179
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
What about quality of work, another section, quality of work.

180
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Here's five pointo for quality of work.

181
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Needs no supervision.

182
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Always produces exceptional work.

183
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
No rework required.

184
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Maximizes resources.

185
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So, needs no resources.

186
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Let's think about that.

187
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I mean, this guy was working in another department.

188
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
He was definitely being managed.

189
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And then always produces exceptional work.

190
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Again, this is as good.

191
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You can get it embedded in exceptional.

192
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, I said, is that you?

193
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Do you not need any supervision?

194
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And he knew, I mean, I know I worked in the department.

195
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I know what's going on.

196
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
He's not going to, you can't lie to me.

197
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I said, how about this?

198
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Needs little supervision.

199
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Producers quality work.

200
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Few errors.

201
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Use resources efficiently.

202
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You know what that is?

203
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That's three pointo.

204
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
I actually gave you a four pointo.

205
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Somewhere in between those two.

206
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I'm actually being kind of generous.

207
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
What do you think?

208
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
How about military bearing and character?

209
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Let's see what that looks like.

210
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Here's what, here's what, here's what the definition for military bearing and character is.

211
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
US Navy, five pointo evaluation.

212
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Exemplary, personal, appearance.

213
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Model of conduct, conduct on and off duty.

214
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:26.000
A leader in physical readiness exemplifies Navy core values honor courage commitment.

215
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Now, this guy is sitting in my office.

216
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
He's in sloppy PT gear.

217
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
His hair is a little bit long.

218
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And he's not, he's not one of these super stud seals.

219
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
That's an awesome physical shape.

220
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
He's kind of a guy that liked to party a bit.

221
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And he was a hard work in seal.

222
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
A great guy.

223
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But I'm saying he wasn't exactly a model of conduct on and off duty.

224
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Think about what that means.

225
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
A model of conduct.

226
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So that's five pointo.

227
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Then I said, listen, let me tell you what I tell him.

228
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Let me tell you what three pointo is.

229
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Excellent personal appearance.

230
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Excellent conduct.

231
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Conchienceously complies with regulations.

232
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Complies with physical readiness program.

233
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Lives up to Navy core values honor courage commitment.

234
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But to me, you know, you're a pretty square away guy, but how do you do on the last PT test?

235
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Because you didn't knock it out of the park.

236
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I know that.

237
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Right?

238
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So are you telling him?

239
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Yes, you're reading them.

240
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I'm reading them.

241
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I'm doing what we're doing right here.

242
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I'm straight up reading them to them.

243
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Because because it was, it's really obvious that these standards are very, very high.

244
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And, you know, also, here's the bottom of the barrel.

245
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Okay.

246
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
This is one pointo.

247
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Four, four values.

248
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Or for military bearing and character.

249
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
This is one pointo.

250
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Consistently unsatisfactory appearance, poor self control, conduct resulting in disciplinary action,

251
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
unable to meet one or more physical readiness requirements, fails to live up to one or more Navy core values honor courage commitment.

252
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So this guy clearly is not a one pointo.

253
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That's a, that's a, that's a bad sailor.

254
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
But this guy is solid.

255
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
He's in the middle. I think I had him with a four pointo. I said, I, I we good with a four row.

256
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Mm-hmm.

257
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Or you can tell me that you crushed that you were the leader of the pack on the last PT test that we did.

258
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
You know, what, will you tell me were you the, were you the five pointo?

259
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
No, no.

260
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Couldn't honestly say it.

261
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And by now he kind of, he kind of got the message that he's no one pointo, but he definitely wasn't a five pointo either.

262
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And, and clearly what I realized is he never actually,

263
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
read through what those standards were.

264
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And clearly that was my fault for not making sure that this guy and the rest of the people at my command understood what the grading criteria was.

265
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And I started to, trying to do that.

266
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And I started to realize that the, the grading criteria was actually solid.

267
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And it was a good guide to being a, a really good seal, a really good sailor, a really good person.

268
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And as you read through some of these five pointo qualities, here's the one for command organizational climate slash equal opportunity.

269
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So if you're, this is your, if you're a five o in this category,

270
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000
measureably contributes to the Navy's increased retention and reduced attrition objective, proactive leader, exemplary mentor, involved in subordinates personal development,

271
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:39.000
leading to professional growth and sustained commitment, initiates support programs for military civilian and families to achieve exceptional command and organizational climate,

272
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
the model of achievement,

273
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
develops unit cohesion by valuing differences as strengths.

274
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
So let's think about that.

275
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000
That's, that's a massive, who's going to get five o in that in the SEAL teams, not too many people because in the SEAL teams, who's initiating support programs?

276
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Means you're, you're actively starting a program to help support, right?

277
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
There's not a lot of guys that are going to hit five point. Oh, and that's the way it should be.

278
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Here's what five point. Oh, looks like for personal job accomplishment and initiative, energetic self-starter,

279
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
completes tasks or qualifications early far better than expected.

280
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
So you're not just doing, you're doing it early and it's still even better than everyone else plans and prioritizes wisely and with exceptional foresight.

281
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Seeks extra responsibility and takes on the hardest jobs.

282
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
That's five point.

283
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Here's the, here's the five point. Oh, for teamwork, team builder inspires cooperation and progress.

284
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Focuses goals and techniques for teams, the best at accepting and offering team direction.

285
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
That's a team player. That's teamwork.

286
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And here's, here's the, here's how you get a five point o in leadership.

287
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Now think about this. You think you're a good seal. You think you're a good sailor.

288
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And you think I'm, I'm a good leader, right?

289
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Here's what you have to do to get a five point o inspiring motivator and trainer.

290
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Subordinates reach highest level of growth and development. So now, since I'm even about you anymore,

291
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
this is about you being a leader and you, not just what you do, but what your subordinates,

292
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
your subordinates have to reach the highest level of growth and development. It goes on superb organizer.

293
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Great foresight develops process improvements and efficiencies.

294
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Leadership achievements, leadership achievement dramatically further command mission and vision.

295
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So what you do is a leader dramatically further is the mission.

296
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Perseverals through the toughest challenges and inspires other, others exceptional communicator.

297
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
How many people do you know that are exceptional communicators? There's not a lot of people that are exceptional communicators.

298
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
That's a hard thing. That's not only being born with some communication skills.

299
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000
It's actively working and honing those skills through your lifetime before someone tells you you're an exceptional communicator.

300
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Makes subordinates safety conscience, maintains top safety record, constantly improves the personal and professional lives of others.

301
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So this is barely even about you anymore. It's how well, how well does your team do?

302
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
So you've got to be 100% squared away if you're going to get a 5.0 in leadership. That's just the way it is.

303
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And like I said, you're not just getting judged on your success, but on the success, not just of the mission, but of the actual individual people that work for you.

304
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And so this, this granular look at these descriptions kind of changed this guy's perspective.

305
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And now he actually saw what he was supposed to be doing. He actually knew what he was aiming at.

306
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And he didn't know that before. And you know who's fault it is that he didn't know that it's my fault.

307
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Because I'm the guy that's in charge and I thought everyone knew or I thought at least everyone was aiming as high as they possibly could at everything.

308
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
But that's actually naive. It's naive for a couple reasons.

309
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Not only is not everyone aiming to be the best they can.

310
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I don't know some people don't care about some things, but sometimes people don't actually understand what it is that they're supposed to be aiming at. They don't understand what the metric is, how they're being measured.

311
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And clearly, you have to have something to aim at.

312
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And if you don't have anything to aim at, then you're never going to get anywhere you're never going to hit the target that's you're not aiming at. You have to aim at the target to hit it.

313
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
You have to know what you're trying to be or you won't be that.

314
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And the Navy, I think, with this evaluation form, does a decent job.

315
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000
If you kind of can take a step back and one problem is with the Navy evaluation system and all the evaluation systems in the military is they're very administrative.

316
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:08.000
It turns into much more of a paperwork drill than it is an actual attempt to make people improve themselves.

317
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Right? It's there, but people are going to fall out. This is where I fell out. Cool. I'm up for motion. Cool. I may not read it.

318
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Right? They don't actually, it's not a true counseling objective isn't to really truly improve those people.

319
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
That's one of the problems with this, with the counseling system inside the Navy and it happens in the other branches as well.

320
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
But if you read that sheet and you kind of take a look at it, then you realize, okay, there are some things that I can aim at now.

321
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And the Navy does a decent job of that. I'll tell you the Marine Corps does an even better job.

322
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:54.000
The United States Marine Corps evaluation system is more detailed and it's more descriptive and it's more complete. The Navy system, the whole Navy evaluation is two pages long.

323
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The Marine Corps, there's six pages long.

324
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.000
And one thing that's interesting about the Marine Corps, in the Navy one they list, okay, you're a one-point-o. This is what you're like as a one-point-o.

325
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:19.000
The Marine Corps doesn't even give descriptions for the low end of the spectrum. They don't even exist. They're not going to waste time describing a loser Marine.

326
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:30.000
They have a higher minimum standard, basically. But this is one thing that struck me. The first time I kind of noticed the Marine Corps evaluation system, because it's an administrative thing.

327
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So it's not like I would see it on a regular basis. When I was in Ramadios in the Brigade Tactical Operations Center, and I was probably there for a meeting with the Brigade Commander or whatever.

328
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And was there for whatever reason? And one of the Marine officers was in there who I knew and we were kind of talking.

329
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
And he was filling out one evaluation for one of his guys and he was on the back page of his evaluation.

330
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And I was just being nosy. I guess looking at what it was like, looking at what their system was like comparing its R system.

331
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:16.000
And I was looking at the form on the last page, the page he was actually working on. There was a graphic representation of Marines and of how they rank Marines.

332
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And it kind of looked like a Christmas tree. So if you picture a Christmas tree and the whole Christmas tree is made up of little eagle globe and anchors, which is the symbol of the Marine Corps.

333
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
And so there's a bunch of little eagle globe and anchors. And they're all positioned on this piece of paper and it looks like a Christmas tree.

334
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And so the bottom, actually the bottom of this graphic, the bottom of this Christmas tree is just an empty space. There's nothing there.

335
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And that line is represented. There's a little indicator that shows what that line represents. That line represents the unqualified Marine.

336
00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So there should be no unqualified Marines in your unit. And then it goes up one level and I've just got one single eagle globe and anchor representing one Marine.

337
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And this, this is, it looks like the trunk of the Christmas tree. And that line is labeled a qualified Marine.

338
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So now you've got one guy, you know, or percentage wise, one person that is simply just a qualified Marine.

339
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
He's qualified, but there's not there shouldn't be that many of them.

340
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And then they go, now he picture Christmas tree above the trunk, now it's a big wide area. And that's where they go to this next level, which has the most, it's like the middle third of the Christmas tree.

341
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And that area, they label that area.

342
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000
One of the many highly qualified professionals who form the majority of this grade.

343
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:00.000
So the biggest chunk of people is sort of in the middle third of this Christmas tree. And that's what it is. Hey, that's what most of the guys are.

344
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:14.000
There's highly, highly qualified people. They make up the most of this group of that are that I'm evaluating. And there they are. And then above that third on this Christmas tree is a, now the Christmas tree is getting smaller, right?

345
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
So now we're getting into a narrow group in this narrow group is labeled.

346
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And it's called so if you're in this group you're being labeled as one of the few exceptionally qualified Marines.

347
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And that again, that's a much smaller number than that middle group.

348
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And then you get to the top of the Christmas tree, where there is a single eagle globe and anchor representing the very best of this group.

349
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:02.000
And it's up there alone at the pinnacle of performance. And there's a label for this singular Marine at the top of his group.

350
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And the label says the eminently qualified Marine.

351
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And I remember when I read that, when I read those words, the eminently qualified Marine.

352
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000
And I thought to myself, that is the ultimate praise.

353
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:40.000
And that's pretty much how the Marine Corps evaluation ends. And it ends in this epic way because it is.

354
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000
It's weird to say this. It's an epic document. It's an epic document. And I want to talk about this document today.

355
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And I want to start off by by the way that the document itself starts off. So this is the Marine Corps fitness report. This is how they grade Marines.

356
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And it starts off with the common dance guidance. So the first thing they get is guidance from the most senior Marine in the Marine Corps.

357
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
And the common dance guidance says the completed fitness report is the most important information component in manpower management.

358
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:24.000
It is the primary means of evaluating a Marine's performance. And is the common dance primary tool for the selection of personnel for promotion augmentation, resident schooling command and duty assignments.

359
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Therefore, the completion of this report is one of an officer's most critical responsibilities.

360
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Inherent in this duty is the commitment of each reporting senior and reviewing officer to ensure the integrity of the system by giving close attention to accurate marking and timely reporting.

361
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Every officer serves a role in the scrupulous maintenance of this evaluation system ultimately important to both the individual and the Marine Corps.

362
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Inflationary markings only serve to dilute the actual value of each report.

363
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Reviewing officers will not concur with inflated reports. So out of the gate we're getting put in check do not come here telling everyone they're great.

364
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000
That's not that's not going to fly. We're rejecting that outright from the start. Now we start the evaluation again. This is set up a little bit similar.

365
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:36.000
To the Navy and they start breaking out what your performance is based on the first thing that it's based on is mission accomplishment.

366
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And mission accomplishment they break into two things the first thing is performance. So here's what it says about performance of mission accomplishment.

367
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:56.000
A accomplishment results achieved during the reporting period. How well those duties inherent to a Marines billet plus all additional duties formally and informally assigned work carried out.

368
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Reflects a Marines aptitude, competence and commitment to the unit success above personal reward.

369
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Indicators are time and restorts management task prioritization and tenacity to achieve positive ends consistently.

370
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So the low end it says meets requirements of billet and additional duties aptitude commitment and competence meet expectations results maintain status quo.

371
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000
So that's that's that's that year you're doing your job. And then if you're at the high end of the spectrum results far surpass expectations.

372
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Recognizes and exploits new resources creates opportunities emulated sought after as an expert with influence beyond unit impact significant innovative approaches to problems produce significant gains in quality and efficiency.

373
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000
If you just take that single bullet and that's what you try and achieve you're smoking.

374
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000
You're crushing you I want to you have someone like that working for you and you're in heaven because this guy's going to make things happen.

375
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Next up proficiency demonstrates technical knowledge and practical skill in the execution of the Marines overall duties.

376
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Combines training, education and experience translates skills into actions which contribute to accomplishing tasks and missions in parts knowledge to others.

377
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Think about this one translates skills and actions.

378
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That's it that's kind of a big deal. How many people have skills but they can't translate them in actions.

379
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Think about that's your life. Hey, you got some skills, but you don't use them. You can't put them anywhere. You can't put them into effect.

380
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Here's the middle grade for proficiency demonstrates mastery of all required skills. So if you've mastered your skills, you're still just in the middle.

381
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Expertise education and experience consistently enhance mission accomplishment innovative troublesheuter and problem solver effectively in parts skills to support it.

382
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
These are the kind of things where if you know that you're supposed to impart skills to your support, you pay attention to it. You start doing it.

383
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
But you might not recognize that that's part of your job. That's part of your life.

384
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Here's what it sounds like if you're an expert. True expert in field knowledge and skills impact far beyond those of peers.

385
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Translates broad based education and experience into forward thinking innovative actions.

386
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Makes immeasurable impact on mission accomplishment.

387
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Purely teacher selflessly imparts expertise to support in its peers and seniors.

388
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Think about that. That is a high bar. That is a high bar. You could work. You could work diligently every single day and fall short of that.

389
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
But let me tell you it's important that you know that you should be working towards it.

390
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Next section individual character. Isn't it legit when you're going to grade someone on their character?

391
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:26.000
This is outstanding. This is outstanding. How many people are not thinking about what their character is? How many people are not actively minding the way that their actions reflect their character?

392
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000
That's the first step. That's the first step because you might think while I'm being videoed.

393
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:53.000
But this is what I'm expected to do. So you might be doing something that's not correct.

394
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:03.000
You might be off chart. You might be aiming at the wrong thing. Hey, I'm acting like a tough guy. I want everyone to know that I'm tough. You realize oh, that's actually stupid.

395
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Yeah. So you can be, you can have in your mind that I'm going to keep my character, but you're wrong.

396
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Because you might be aiming at the wrong thing. So this gives you some pretty specific things to aim at.

397
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Topic number one. Courage. Mooray or physical strength to overcome danger fear difficulty or anxiety. Personal acceptance of responsibility and accountability.

398
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Placing conscience over competing interests. Regardless of consequences.

399
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Conscious overriding decision to risk bodily harm or death to a compus the mission or save others the will to persevere despite uncertainty.

400
00:35:46.000 --> 00:36:00.000
What if you're thinking about the fact that you're getting graded on your will to persevere despite uncertainty? You think about that every day. You don't know what your future holds, but you're going to persevere regardless.

401
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Think if you're getting graded on that every day.

402
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Here's what the bottom end of the spectrum is demonstrates inner strength. So at the minimum you're demonstrating inner strength and acceptance of responsibility.

403
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Commence for it with the scope of duties and experience willing to face moral or physical danger in pursuit of mission accomplishment. So even at the low end of the spectrum you're still willing to face danger moral or physical challenges.

404
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Here's the middle guided by conscience in all actions. Provenability. Provenability to overcome danger fear difficulty or anxiety.

405
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Exhibits bravery in the face of adversity and certainty. Not deterred by moral difficult situations morally difficult situations or hazardous responsibilities.

406
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
How often are people deterred by difficult situations?

407
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Daily morally difficult situations.

408
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Here's the top of the spectrum for courage. Uncommon bravery and capacity to overcome obstacles and inspire others in the face of moral dilemma or life threatening danger.

409
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
So not even just about you. You have to actually take it to level your inspiring others demonstrated under the most adverse conditions selfless.

410
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Always places conscience over competing interest regardless of physical or personal consequences.

411
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
That's that competition we talked about. The competition between oh I'm going to take care of myself and I'm going to take care of the team.

412
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000
But you know what's doing what's right to do instead of what is easy to do.

413
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.000
The next section that you get created on your individual character is effectiveness under stress.

414
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
This is just outstanding. Because it's not think about this. You don't even see this in business.

415
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000
In business. I don't see this in when people evaluate other other in the business world, but there's stress in business world. There's a different kind of stress, but it's stress.

416
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Here's effectiveness under stress. Here's what you're doing. Thinking functioning and leading effectively under conditions of physical and or mental pressure.

417
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And composure appropriate for the situation while displaying steady purpose of action enabling one to its inspire others while continuing to lead under adverse conditions.

418
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Physical and emotional strength resilience and endurance are elements.

419
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Low end of the spectrum. Exhibits discipline and stability under pressure. Judgment and effective problem solving skills are evident.

420
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
I'm going to go into the spectrum. By the way, how many people do you think do you know that don't exhibit any discipline or stability under pressure?

421
00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Right? There's all kinds of people. There's all kinds of people. And we know when it's the last time you didn't do a good job under pressure.

422
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Probably this morning. It happens, right?

423
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Especially when you're not thinking about it, especially when you're not aimed at the correct response to pressure. Yeah.

424
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Especially when you haven't put a standard in your mind.

425
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Remember when you used to kind of freak out in your jutsu when you got claustrophobic, right? Sure.

426
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Right? Sure. You'd get an imposition. Yeah.

427
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Usually side control. Right? You didn't like that. Yeah.

428
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You didn't like the pressure on the chest. There were more circumstances surrounding those scenarios.

429
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
But you're mental. Yeah. More problems. Yeah. I would have to, yeah.

430
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Okay. Yes. I do remember that. At some point, you said to yourself, alright.

431
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
I cannot act that way anymore. You made a, you said a bar for yourself.

432
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Yes, sir. That's the beginning of solving the problem.

433
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Yeah. That's what I love about this. It's actually setting a bar of when you're under stress. This is how you got to act.

434
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
If you're, if you're a little above average for effective or some stress, here's where you're at.

435
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Consistently demonstrates maturity, mental agility, and will power during periods of adversity.

436
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Provides order to chaos through the application of intuition, problem solving skills, and leadership.

437
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Composure reassures other.

438
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Imagine you're around a team and this is the average guy. This is just so impressive.

439
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
But my point is, unless you tell your guys what average is, they won't know it.

440
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
They don't understand it.

441
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Here's the high end. So this is when you look at your troops and you say, this is what I want you to do.

442
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
We come under massive amounts of stress. Here's the model I want you to try and perform as demonstrates.

443
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Sell the matched presence of mind under the most demanding circumstances.

444
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Stabilizes any situation through the resolute and timely application of direction, focus, and personal presence.

445
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Now, what I was doing this, I was actually only going to read the high end when I was thinking about this.

446
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
But then I realized each one of these builds, and that person at the high end already has the other two.

447
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
But there's other elements in there that aren't mentioned in the high end.

448
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So you've got to mention and you assume when someone's on the high end, they got those obviously. They got the lower end things wrapped up.

449
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
So you've got to combine all these three together.

450
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
The low grade, the middle grade and the high grade.

451
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000
We want people to show an issue. Talk about this all the time. This is the essence of decentralized command is that people show an issue.

452
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Here's what they say about an issue of action in the absence of specific direction.

453
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting.

454
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So I'm listening to all of these as my own.

455
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
This whole thing.

456
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And at first I was like, oh, that's cool. That's how the Navy kind of evaluates people.

457
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You're going to talk about the Marines and stuff.

458
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
But maybe like the second little part you started reading, I just started applying it to myself.

459
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
That's what I'm saying.

460
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Like my life.

461
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Yeah.

462
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Okay. So you know, we're all part of it.

463
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Like if you have a family, if you're the dad or something, or whatever.

464
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
If you're in a family unit, you're part of a team right there.

465
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And you know, your goals change from time to time.

466
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
But you sort of know the goals.

467
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
So I'm like thinking of my mind every little element that you're talking about.

468
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I'm like, okay, let me evaluate myself for sure with this.

469
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Like how good and your right man.

470
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So a lot of times like, okay, so performing under stress.

471
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
I don't like this all these little things.

472
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
You're going to the beach and you're trying to make it on the, you know,

473
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
The beach.

474
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
The beach.

475
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
You're trying to be a nice.

476
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
You're trying to make it the beach.

477
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
We have a high stress level.

478
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah.

479
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
But the kids need their water and they need their change of clothes.

480
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
You might get cold.

481
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
They need to jacket all the stuff.

482
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Meanwhile, the clock is taking you know, daylight.

483
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
You don't want to miss sunset all the stuff.

484
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So how are you going to perform under that stress?

485
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
You know, and I get it.

486
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Well, the fun thing is you're, you're bringing up this, you're bringing up this.

487
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
And I'm actually completely making fun of you for bringing up that stress.

488
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
How often are you at a public place?

489
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And you see a family.

490
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And they're running later, whatever.

491
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
And you see a leader of the family, mother or father,

492
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Freaking out losing their composure over the stress that we are actually joking about.

493
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
You're a little bit serious.

494
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I'm joking about it.

495
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
But still, you see people lose their minds because of dumb things.

496
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Oh, yeah.

497
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And there's a little bit of stress in their world.

498
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And they drop off.

499
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
They freak out for them.

500
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Exactly.

501
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
So my question is, do those people, has anyone ever sat them down and explained to them what the standard is?

502
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Yes, sir.

503
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
And that's my point here.

504
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Yeah.

505
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
A lot of times, people don't even recognize.

506
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
They don't even know they don't even understand what the

507
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
eminently qualified human being is how they are going to act in these situations.

508
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yeah.

509
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Totally, totally exactly 100% right there.

510
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000
So like, okay, so, you know how you ever have a guy who like loses temper and then like you say, hey, you kind of lost it there.

511
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And then he goes back to how he felt like almost like the way he felt justified.

512
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Oh, yeah.

513
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Yeah.

514
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
So you just understand, here's the thing, Brad.

515
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
We know you felt like that.

516
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Yeah.

517
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Really demonstrate.

518
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So you don't have to explain that.

519
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
But yeah, you were feeling this and you behaved the certain way.

520
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000
But if that guy knew that he was being evaluated on his behavior, regardless of how he feels, but he'd be aiming how you put it.

521
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
That's it.

522
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
That's the key part.

523
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
It's not, it's not just the grading part.

524
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
It's, you have to know what the standard is because that guy that might not even understand.

525
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:06.000
If I lose my temper, I think it was, I think it was JP, JP really took it to heart when he heard me say losing your temper as a weakness.

526
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah.

527
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Before that, he just didn't, you know, because you see other people in your life and see other team guys, you see your dad, you see your uncle and they fly off the handle and you almost have a respect for it.

528
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Right?

529
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
You definitely respect your when your dad loses your temper, you kind of think, wow, that's powerful.

530
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
How can I have some of that power?

531
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Well, you just do that, right?

532
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
So you just learn mechanism and then eventually you realize or someone tells you, hey, when you lose your temper, you're not in control.

533
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Matter of fact, you're not in control at all.

534
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And whatever made you lose your temper is controlling you and losing your temper is, is a weakness.

535
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And so that's the big difference.

536
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:51.000
It's not just, hey, you're being graded, you're being watched, which is definitely a great mindset to have, but you have to understand what the parameters are that you're being measured by that you're being graded on.

537
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
And that's where this comes into play.

538
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000
The next section I just started with initiative, it we want subordinates to take initiative, but we want everyone to take initiative, right?

539
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Your kids, you want your kids to take initiative.

540
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
You want people in your free one, everyone to take initiative.

541
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I used to say to the young seal, you put them commanders and task them commanders, I would say, imagine if everyone in your, everyone in your fire team leaders just was doing something smart.

542
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
They just took initiative and made it happen.

543
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Your job becomes so easy because you don't have to control everything everyone just making things happen. That's initiative.

544
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
So here's what it says about initiative action in the absence of specific direction.

545
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting.

546
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:49.000
The instinct to begin a task and follow through energetically on one's own accord, being creative, proactive, and decisive, transforming opportunity into action.

547
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.000
So that's what initiative. If you're on the low end, you demonstrate willingness to take action, the absence of specific direction.

548
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Acts commensurate with grade, training and experience.

549
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
That's what we expect of you.

550
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
A little bit better.

551
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
In the middle, self-motivated and action-oriented.

552
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Forsight and energy consistently transform opportunity into action, develops and pursues creative initiative solutions.

553
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Or sorry, innovative solutions. Acts without prompting self-struck.

554
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000
That's what we want. And then here we go, the high end. Highly motivated and proactive.

555
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Displays exceptional awareness of surroundings and environment, uncanny ability to anticipate mission requirements,

556
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000
and quickly formulate original, far-reaching solutions always takes decisive, effective action.

557
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000
With definitions like that, it's no wonder there's only one Marina at the top of that Christmas tree.

558
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Because that is a squared away individual right there.

559
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Far, you know what's crazy about this?

560
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Having put so many people through training myself.

561
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Even though there's only one allotted space up there, there are so many people that are capable of this kind of behavior.

562
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
It's way more than one percent. It's way more than 10 percent.

563
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
If you have people that understand what the parameters are and really aim to them,

564
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
you can get a lot closer than most people would think.

565
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Yeah.

566
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And I mean, obviously, I don't know.

567
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
But it seems like what you're talking about.

568
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Like a lot of people just don't know.

569
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
No, no, no, no. The standard and they don't know.

570
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
They don't know.

571
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
They don't know. It's not been made clear to them.

572
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
The next section.

573
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Leadership.

574
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
And this is broken.

575
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
It's a multiple sections.

576
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Obviously, because leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

577
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So this is their biggest section.

578
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Leadership.

579
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Section number one leading subordinates.

580
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
The inseparable relationship between leader and lead.

581
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
The application of leadership principles to provide direction and motivate subordinates.

582
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Using authority, persuasion and personality to influence subordinates to accomplish

583
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
assigned tasks.

584
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Sustaining motivation and morale while maximizing subordinates performance.

585
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
So there you go.

586
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
That's what you're going to do as a leader.

587
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Low end.

588
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Engaged provides instructions and directs execution.

589
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Seats to accomplish mission in ways that sustain motivation and morale.

590
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Actions contribute to unit effectiveness.

591
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Cool.

592
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
So you're acceptable.

593
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Middle ground achieves a highly effective balance between direction and delegation.

594
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
We're talking a little dichotomy.

595
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Effectively task subordinates and clearly delineates.

596
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Extenders expect it.

597
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Enhances performance through constructive supervision.

598
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Foster's motivation and enhances morale.

599
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Builds and sustains teams.

600
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Successfully meet mission requirements.

601
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Encourage is initiative and canter among subordinates.

602
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
So you can see that the low end you're kind of just telling people what to do a little bit.

603
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Right?

604
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Now you're starting to ask for feedback.

605
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
You're starting to build that bond.

606
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Here's the high end.

607
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Number one thing for the high end.

608
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Promotes creativity and energy among subordinates by striking into the ideal balance of

609
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
direction and delegation.

610
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Achieve's highest levels of performance from subordinates by encouraging individual initiative.

611
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
That's decentralized command.

612
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I'm going to let you guys run and that's going to maximize performance.

613
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
This is an incredible term.

614
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Ingenders willing subordination, loyalty and trust that allow subordinates to overcome their perceived limitations.

615
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Whaling subordination when your team actually wants to follow you.

616
00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Personal leadership fosters highest level of motivation and morale.

617
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Ensuring mission accomplishment even in the most difficult circumstances.

618
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Next section.

619
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Developing subordinates commitment to train, educate and challenge all Marines regardless of race,

620
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000
religion, ethnic background or gender, mentorship, cultivating professional and personal development of subordinates,

621
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
developing team players in a speed of core.

622
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Ability to combine teaching and coaching, creating an atmosphere, tolerant of mistakes in the course of learning.

623
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
You know, here you'll think about that very often in the Marine Corps and they work tolerant of mistakes.

624
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
That's how you learn.

625
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Low end to the spectrum maintains an environment that allows personal professional development.

626
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Ensures subordinates participate in all mandated development programs.

627
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Middle ground develops and institutes innovative programs.

628
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So you're proactively trying to bring up and raise your subordinates make them better.

629
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
To include PMA which is professional military education.

630
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
That emphasize personal and professional development of subordinates.

631
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Challenges subordinates to exceed their perceived potential.

632
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
They're by enhancing unit morale and effectiveness.

633
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Creates an environment where all Marines are confident to learn through trial and error as a mentor prepares subordinates for increased responsibilities and duties.

634
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
By the way, this is the number two item under leadership.

635
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
The first one is leading.

636
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
The second one is developing your subordinates.

637
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Here's the top end of the spectrum.

638
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Why'd be recognized and and emulated as a teacher, coach and leader?

639
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Any Marine would desire to serve with this Marine because they know they will grow personally and professionally.

640
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Subordinate and unit performance far surpasses expected results due to mentorship and team building talents.

641
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Subordinate development is infectious extending beyond the unit.

642
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
That's bold.

643
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Now you're training your people so well that other people in other units are starting to train their people.

644
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
You're thinking about that impact right there.

645
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
That's how you develop.

646
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
You develop your subordinates so much that some other leader in a different company in a different platoon.

647
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000
In a different battalion says we're going to start following that program.

648
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
That's the leadership right there.

649
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Section number three, setting the example.

650
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
The most visible facet of leadership.

651
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
How well a Marine serves as a role model for all others.

652
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Personal action demonstrates the highest standards of conduct, ethical behavior, fitness and appearance,

653
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
bearing demeanor and self-discipline are elements.

654
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Low end.

655
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Maintains Marine Corps standards for appearance, weight and uniform wear.

656
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Sistains required level of physical fitness at ears to the tenants of the Marine Corps values.

657
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Fine.

658
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
You're accepted.

659
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Middle grade.

660
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Personal conduct on and off duty reflects highest Marine Corps standards of integrity, bearing and appearance.

661
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:27.000
The director is exceptional, actively seeks self-improvement in wide-ranging areas, dedication to duty and professional example,

662
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
encourage others self-improvement efforts.

663
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
That's the middle grade.

664
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
In the middle grade, you reflect the highest Marine Corps standards of integrity, bearing and appearance.

665
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
You know what that means?

666
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
That means 24 hours a day.

667
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
You're in the game.

668
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
That's what that means.

669
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
It means you're actively seeking self-improvement in wide-ranging areas.

670
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
You're trying to get better everywhere.

671
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
That's middle ground, by the way.

672
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000
High ground.

673
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Model Marine.

674
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Frequently emulated.

675
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Exemplary conduct, behavior and actions are tone setting.

676
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
An inspiration to subordinates peers and seniors.

677
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Remarkable dedication to improving self and others.

678
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
What are you trying to do to get better?

679
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
I mean, I say that.

680
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I said that on this podcast, in the day one, we're trying to get better.

681
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
What are you doing, actually?

682
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
What's the activity?

683
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Because in other words, you see here a lot of this is action, action, action, words into action.

684
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I'd be as an actions, skills into action.

685
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
I was going back and forth with a guy that I did some work with for echelon front.

686
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
And I work with him quite a few years ago overseas.

687
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
And we still text back and forth from time to time.

688
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000
And he, I said, hey, because he was telling me some of the notes he had taken.

689
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
And I said, send me some of the notes.

690
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And he, for the first note he sent me, was, you can't think things better.

691
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.000
It's a solid piece of advice.

692
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Because he's one of these guys that that was a thinker, right?

693
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Big thinker.

694
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
And I'm all about thinking, you know, let's develop our brain.

695
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Let's develop our mind power.

696
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Let's think about things. Let's be thoughtful. That's fine.

697
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
But you can't think things better.

698
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
They're not going to get better unless you actually apply the skills.

699
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Skills into action.

700
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Faut into action.

701
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Next, ensuring well-being of subordinates.

702
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
The genuine interest in the well-being of Marines.

703
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Enhances subordinates ability to concentrate focus on mission accomplishment.

704
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Concern for family readiness is inherent.

705
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000
The importance placed on welfare of subordinates is based on the belief that Marines take care of their own.

706
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Low end of the spectrum deals confidently with issues pertinent to subordinate welfare

707
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
and recognizes suitable courses of action that supports subordinates well-being.

708
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Applies available resources allowing subordinates to effectively concentrate on the mission.

709
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
At a minimum, you're absolutely taken care of your people.

710
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Middle grade instills and or reinforces a sense of responsibility among

711
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Junior Marines for themselves and their subordinates.

712
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Actively, fosteres the development of and uses support system for subordinates

713
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000
which improve their ability to contribute to unit mission accomplishment.

714
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Efforts to enhance subordinate welfare improve the unit's ability to accomplish their mission.

715
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
People don't think about that fact.

716
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
The people that are actually accomplishing the mission are people.

717
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
If those people aren't ready to perform because even neglected them,

718
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
you're not going to be able to accomplish the mission.

719
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
High grade.

720
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Noticeably enhances subordinates well-being, resulting in measurable increase in unit effectiveness.

721
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Maximizes unit and base resources to provide subordinates with the best support available.

722
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Proactive approach serves to energize unit members to take care of their own.

723
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
They're by correcting potential problems before they can hinder subordinates effectiveness.

724
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Why'd be recognized for techniques and policies that produce results and build morale?

725
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Builds strong family atmosphere, puts motto, mission first,

726
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Marines always into action.

727
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Boom.

728
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Last section for leadership.

729
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Communication skills.

730
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:04.000
The efficient transmission and receipt of thoughts and ideas that enable and enhance leadership.

731
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Equal importance given to listening, speaking, writing, and critical reading skills.

732
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Interactive allowing one to perceive problems and situations,

733
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:22.000
provide concise guidance and express complex ideas in a form easily understood by everyone.

734
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Allows subordinates to ask questions, raise issues, and concerns, and venture opinions.

735
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Contributes to a leader's ability to motivate as well as counsel.

736
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Minimal.

737
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Skilled and receiving in conveying information communicates effectively in performance adudies.

738
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
That's a minimum.

739
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Above average, middle grade.

740
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Clearly articulates thoughts and ideas verbally and in writing.

741
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Let's think about that.

742
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Middle ground.

743
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Do you know how hard it is for people to clearly articulate thoughts and ideas verbally?

744
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
An idea is verbally and in writing.

745
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000
It is a skill you need to work on all the time.

746
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
By the way, this gets you a middle grade here.

747
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Communication in all forms is accurate, intelligent, concise, and timely.

748
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Those standards accurate, intelligent, concise, and timely.

749
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Communicates with clarity and verb ensuring understanding of intent or purpose,

750
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000
encourages and considers the contributions of others.

751
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
High grade.

752
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Here we go.

753
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Highly developed facility in verbal communication.

754
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Adept in composing written documents of the highest quality.

755
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Combines presence and verbal skills which in gender, confidence and achieve understanding

756
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
irrespective of setting, situation or size of group addressed.

757
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Displays an intuitive sense of when and how to listen.

758
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
So.

759
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Read, write, speak, listen and do it all the time.

760
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
If you're in a leadership position or you want to be in one.

761
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
The reading part, people asked me what I learned in college.

762
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000
One of the most important things that I learned in college was, I was an English major.

763
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This is why I was an English major by the way, because I recognized when I was at a

764
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Seal team as a young officer that one of the most important things I was going to be

765
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
dealing with was communicating with other humans.

766
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And I needed to have good command of the English language and of reading and of writing

767
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
the English language.

768
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
But when I had to decipher Shakespeare and I took a lot of Shakespeare and you realize that

769
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
you don't know what words mean and you realize that you don't understand the sentence

770
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
construction and you what you realize is that you have to break them down and go through

771
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
them and figure it out.

772
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So when I would get the rules of engagement from up the chain of command five years later

773
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
and I didn't understand them because they were using words. I didn't know I said, okay,

774
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
what I need to do is look these up.

775
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Read it, find out some substitute words, make sense of it,

776
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
look up the definition of what they're specifically talking about and go from there

777
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
because when you first if you just open up Shakespeare and you don't understand something,

778
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
what do you do? You say it's stupid.

779
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
When somebody writes a rules of engagement and there's words in there and you don't understand

780
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
if you don't understand how to parse things apart and look up definitions and

781
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
you can't be humble enough to recognize that there's some things that you don't know.

782
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Well, then all you do is go, this is stupid.

783
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Check communications.

784
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000
The next thing, no one really probably thinks that this is going to be in here for

785
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
the Marine Corps. The next section you're getting great on as grated on as a Marine is intellect

786
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
and wisdom.

787
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
There are things people in the military is a bunch of knuckle draggers.

788
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Think it's all about brawn.

789
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
But there you go, intellect and wisdom.

790
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Professional military education, PME, committed to intellectual growth in ways beneficial

791
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
to the Marine Corps. Increases breadth and depth of war fighting and leadership

792
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
aptitude.

793
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Resources include resident schools, professional qualifications and certification processes,

794
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
non-resident and other extension courses, civilian educational institutional coursework,

795
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
a personal reading program that includes but is not limited to selections from the

796
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
common-on's reading list.

797
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Participation in discussion groups and military societies and involvement in learning through new technologies.

798
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
You got to get in the game right there.

799
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Got to get educated.

800
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Here's low end.

801
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Maintains currency and required military skills and related developments.

802
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Has completed or is enrolled in appropriate level of PME for grade and level of experience.

803
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Recognizes and understands new and creative approaches to service issues,

804
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000
remains abreast of contemporary concepts and issues.

805
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Middle grade PME outlook expands beyond MOS and required education.

806
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So you're not even worried about your own job.

807
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You've got that covered. Now you're going outside of what your job is.

808
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Develops and follows a comprehensive personal program, which includes broadened professional reading

809
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
and or academic coursework advances new concepts and ideas.

810
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And here's your high end.

811
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Dedicated to lifelong learning.

812
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:17.000
As a result of active and continuous efforts widely recognized as an intellectual leader in professionally related topics.

813
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Makes time for study and takes advantage of all resources and programs.

814
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Introduces new and creative approaches to service issues.

815
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Engages in a broad spectrum of forums and dialogues.

816
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So this is never going to stop. You've got to keep feeding your brain.

817
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The next thing you're getting graded on an intellect and wisdom decision making ability.

818
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Viable and timely problem solution.

819
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Contributing elements are judgment and decisiveness.

820
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Decisions reflect the balance between an optimal solution and a satisfactory,

821
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
workable solution that generates tempo.

822
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So there's a good dichotomy for you. Optimal decision on one side.

823
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Workable decision that can keep you moving on the other side.

824
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You've got to balance that dichotomy.

825
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Decisions are made within the context of the commanders established intent and the goal of mission accomplishment.

826
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So of course you're trying to support the commanders intent.

827
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Inticipation, mental agility, intuition and success are inherent.

828
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000
This is not the first time they brought up intuition in here. How you develop intuition, experience, wisdom, reading,

829
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
low end.

830
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Low end makes sound decisions leading to mission accomplishment.

831
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
That's the minimum. The minimum is to make sound decisions.

832
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Actively collects and evaluates information in ways alternative alternatives to achieve timely results.

833
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Confidently approaches problems, accepts responsibility for outcomes.

834
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Middle grade demonstrates mental agility.

835
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Effectively prioritizes and solves multiple complex problems. This prioritizes next to you.

836
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Analytical abilities enhanced by experience, education and intuition.

837
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Inticipates problems and implements viable long-term solutions.

838
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Steadfast willing to make difficult decisions.

839
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That's a high bar for middle grade. High grade.

840
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Wildly recognized and sought after to resolve the most critical complex problems.

841
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Seldom matched analytical and intuitive abilities.

842
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Accurately for sees unexpected problems and arrives at well-time decisions despite fog and friction.

843
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Completely confident approach to all problems.

844
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Masterfully strikes a balance between the desire for perfect knowledge and greater tempo.

845
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Wildly recognized to solve problems.

846
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000
This little line here accurately for sees unexpected problems and arrives at well-time decisions despite fog and friction.

847
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Pass up big ass, right there. You've got to be in the game.

848
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
You've got to be in the game to get to that level.

849
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Last thing you're getting great on on for in-elect wisdom is judgment.

850
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000
The discretionary aspect of decision-making draws in core values, knowledge and personal experience to make wise choices.

851
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Comprehends the consequences of contemplated courses of action.

852
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Minimum grade. Majority of judgments are measured, circumspect, relevant and correct.

853
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Minimum.

854
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The middle grade decisions are consistent and uniformly correct, tempered by consideration of their consequences.

855
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Abel to identify, isolate and assess relevant factors in the decision-making process.

856
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Opinion sought by others.

857
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Subborn it's personally personal interest in favor of impartiality.

858
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
In the high-end decisions reflect exceptional insight and wisdom beyond this marine experience.

859
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Council sought by all, often an arbiter, consistent, superior judgment inspires the confidence of seniors.

860
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So that's how you get graded on intellect and wisdom. And actually the last thing that they grade you on is they actually grade you on how well you evaluate your other Marines.

861
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:05.000
The extent to which this officer serving as a reporting official conducted or required others to conduct accurate, uninflated and timely evaluations.

862
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
This is the last thing you get graded on.

863
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And they go through, you have a low end, it's like you did a good job.

864
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The high-end is you do an outstanding job, but they're grading you on how well you grade.

865
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And then you get to the last page, which is where you have the Christmas tree, the Eagle Globe and Anchor Christmas tree.

866
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Comparative assessment, provide a comparative assessment of potential by placing an X in the appropriate box.

867
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000
In marking the comparison consider all the Marines of this grade whose professional abilities are known to you personally.

868
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And then you go through that tree, the unqualified, unsatisfactory, a qualified Marine.

869
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.000
One of the many highly qualified professionals who formed the majority of this grade, one of the few exceptionally qualified Marines.

870
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And then you get to the top, the singular Marine at the top, who is the eminently qualified Marine.

871
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
The eminently qualified Marine.

872
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And that's what I think makes this interesting.

873
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Is to consider that statement, eminently qualified.

874
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And think about where you're at.

875
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And you're not a top, I'm not a top, none of us are at the top, who can be.

876
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
But what are we striving to be?

877
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:59.000
What are we striving to be? Are we striving to be the most eminently qualified human being that we can be?

878
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Do you even know what that means? Do you even have those thoughts in your head?

879
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm guessing you don't, I barely do.

880
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I know I've had vague thoughts. I know I had definitions that floated around my head of what I was trying to be.

881
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.000
What I'm trying to be today. But why aren't those solid? Why aren't they?

882
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I was thinking about this. I was talking to Dave Burke.

883
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Yeah, good deal, Dave. And I was like, hey, we need to build this.

884
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000
You're basically an evaluation system for humans.

885
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
To become eminently qualified as a human. What does that look like?

886
01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Not only to grave yourself, but to actually know what you are trying to be.

887
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Dave and I will work on that. So stand by to get some.

888
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And until until we do get that out, then think about.

889
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Think about. Are there areas that you know?

890
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
What the goal is that you're walking around thinking that you deserve a five point of.

891
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
But you really actually. You really actually deserve two.

892
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I know I do that.

893
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Yes, right? Yes, I'm thinking I'm good. I'm walking around.

894
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I'm thinking I'm running everything right. I'm thinking I come correct.

895
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But the reality is I don't.

896
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
And the reality is you have that little moving goal post in your head.

897
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
You move it around a little bit.

898
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
You give yourself a little bit more slack one day than you tighten it up because you're feeling good the next day.

899
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You can go back and off a little bit more. But as far as you're concerned, that's a five.

900
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Oh, right. You're there. You're in there.

901
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And the reality is I don't measure up the way I should be measuring up on a daily basis on an hourly basis.

902
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Who's grading me? Who's lying to me? You know who is me?

903
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:37.000
But until we clarify what the aim is, what the goal is and what those standards are, how am I supposed to hold myself accountable to those standards when they don't even exist?

904
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So I'm going to make them exist. I'm going to put them in. I'm going to put them on paper.

905
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
We're going to come up with that eminently qualified human being. What that looks like.

906
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Because we all got all got ideas floating around up there.

907
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yeah.

908
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well, I'm going to bring it. I'm going to apply that.

909
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Put it in the action. Put it in the action.

910
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Right. Are we doing everything that we could be doing? Everything that we should be doing. Are we cutting corners? Are we slack enough?

911
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
We're giving ourselves a five point. Oh, when we should be at best cracking a two.

912
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Daily. How much are we leaving on the table every day? That's a question for you.

913
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Right. How much are we leaving on the table? How much are you saying? I know what. I can just leave that there. It's fine.

914
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000
How much how many things just do you accept this collateral damage?

915
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Like something goes wrong. Like one thing goes wrong.

916
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So there's just collateral damage. Other things are just going to fall by the way. And you're good with it.

917
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You're good with it.

918
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Something you, you know, you hurt my knee. Oh, co. Guess what? I'm going to eat a donut.

919
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah.

920
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Is that where we're at?

921
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Is that what we're at?

922
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Or is there collateral damage? Oh, work was hard.

923
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Therefore, I'm going to, you know, treat my family. Not going to have a good family quality time tonight.

924
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Collateral damage. Because they, what do you expect from me?

925
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Yeah.

926
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Right. Where is the collateral damage? Why are we allowing this collateral damage?

927
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Well, part of the reason I'm telling you that we allow this collateral damage is because we're not effectively grading ourselves.

928
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And even worse than that. We don't even know what standard we're trying to achieve.

929
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
No one's even told us the minimum standard.

930
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Okay. So why is your life going marginal right now? Why are you doing okay? Why am I doing okay right now?

931
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Well, it's because I have some vague idea.

932
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I have, I kind of know I'm heading in the right general direction.

933
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That's not good enough to get maximum.

934
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000
It's not good enough to be amin' itly qualified.

935
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It doesn't work.

936
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
You have to step it up.

937
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000
You have to, you have to have the unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

938
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And that's hard. It's hard for one day never mind every single day.

939
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So I'm gonna make this evaluation.

940
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
David and I are gonna make it.

941
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I'll get it out to y'all.

942
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And until then, I'll try and get it turned around because quick is possible at least some kind of a.

943
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
What is it called an early version of beta test?

944
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Is that what it's called?

945
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Oh sure. I think.

946
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
No, like the technology.

947
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Right right right right.

948
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah.

949
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Yeah.

950
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
We're gonna beta test.

951
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
We'll try and get something out there quick.

952
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
And until then, start looking at yourself.

953
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
As usual, your strengths, your weaknesses,

954
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000
and start trying to see where you can improve.

955
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Start moving towards the goal of becoming the

956
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000
eminently qualified human being.

957
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
To where we're at.

958
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And I think that is all I've got for tonight.

959
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
So echo Charles, what do you got?

960
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Oh, I got.

961
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I know.

962
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I know we're trying to step up.

963
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Yep.

964
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
We got thoughts.

965
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Well, yeah.

966
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
So you and you actually mentioned it in like right there at the end there.

967
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Where all these little.

968
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Oh, not little.

969
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But all these evaluations are like, you know, you do this consistently and all this stuff.

970
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
It's.

971
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So there's two kind of parts to that when I think you.

972
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You.

973
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
You have to do all these good things, right?

974
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
To be the minimum or to be the, you know, you,

975
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
you can't even really be in the group if you're not in the minimum, right?

976
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But you gotta do those things every day.

977
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Like you have to essentially be known for these things.

978
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yeah.

979
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So so how we get jammed up, I think, when we when we are conscious of like how good am I doing in XYZ area of my life,

980
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
whatever.

981
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And if it's something that you're working on a lot of times we don't get the accurate evaluation.

982
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
To ourselves because we'll do, we'll do it really good one day.

983
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And we'll do it really good two days.

984
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And I'm playing tang.

985
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I'm pretty good at this.

986
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So I'm going to go ahead and give myself like a for whatever.

987
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But meanwhile, you only did it twice.

988
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Me, you know, in the whole week you did it twice.

989
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
You're so happy because it's this big change because you usually do it zero.

990
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
So you're like, hey, I got this.

991
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Your minimum bar was so low that you think you're crushing it.

992
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Oh yeah.

993
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Oh yeah.

994
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Two times.

995
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And you're just because in your mind you kind of are comparatively.

996
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Be careful.

997
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Like if you have a standard and stuff then you can act more accurately.

998
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But we don't have standard.

999
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
So in your mind it feels like,

1000
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Oh, I got this.

1001
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I got it.

1002
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I got it.

1003
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm a for now.

1004
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
You know, you should be a one.

1005
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I'm a for now.

1006
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So meanwhile, you're not a for you're actually still a one.

1007
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Yeah.

1008
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Really?

1009
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
You think you're you.

1010
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And there's also there's also this.

1011
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
There's also and I and I talked to Dave about this a little bit.

1012
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
There's a there's a short term grade and there's a long term grade because check this out.

1013
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Let's say you let's say you never worked out before.

1014
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And you've been watching video games and he don't nuts and and just, you know,

1015
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
in in bad physical shape.

1016
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Yeah.

1017
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Your grade.

1018
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Your overall grade for physical fitness is whatever.

1019
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
It's a one point up.

1020
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
It's a low.

1021
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It's a low stick and go.

1022
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
But daily.

1023
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
If you get up, okay, look, look, I can only run one mile and it's going to take me 20 minutes.

1024
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Twenty two minutes.

1025
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I'm going to do it.

1026
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And then I'm going to do as many push ups as I can, which is 23 by the way.

1027
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
If I did a one mile run in 22 minutes and did 23 pushups, that would,

1028
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I would get a one point.

1029
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Oh, for the day.

1030
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But this individual that's been on the couch living a sedentary lifestyle.

1031
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
If he does that, guess what?

1032
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
He's going to get him.

1033
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
He's going to get a high degree.

1034
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
He's going to get a four point eight for the day.

1035
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Hmm.

1036
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
So then he's leading himself in the right direction.

1037
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yeah.

1038
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
So not only is that not only do you have, this is one of the problems.

1039
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And again, this is something I told Dave, I'm like, listen.

1040
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
A once a buy annual twice a year, every six months, you're getting a grade.

1041
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
That doesn't help you.

1042
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
What you need to look at yourself every day.

1043
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You need to look at yourself every day and say, did I truly live this way?

1044
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Live the way I should be living today.

1045
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Yeah.

1046
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And then those standards need to be clear.

1047
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And then you need to apply them to your life.

1048
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Yeah.

1049
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I might even say like that example you just gave.

1050
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So the guy who's sitting on the couch all the time, whatever, or every day.

1051
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And now he's doing he's working out every day.

1052
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But his physical fitness standard technically still loves to do that.

1053
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Yeah.

1054
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Maybe another area of evaluation is like, you know, improvement or you know, how should you say,

1055
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
or back when you're young, you know, they give you that most improved kind of thing.

1056
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Yeah.

1057
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Maybe that could be part of it.

1058
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I think it will be covered by the daily track, the daily track.

1059
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Like, okay, you got a four point out today.

1060
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
What you're ever trying to know, my average for the last one.

1061
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
My running average for 30 days is I'm hitting a 3.9 physical fitness.

1062
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah.

1063
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
I mean, I'm doing something every day.

1064
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I'm pushing the envelope.

1065
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I'm improving.

1066
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Now my overall score is moved from a one to a one point two.

1067
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Yeah.

1068
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Because I'm in a little bit better shape, but it's still not where it needs to be.

1069
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Yeah.

1070
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
That's what that can crush some people.

1071
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Right?

1072
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
If someone goes over the one point two, I'm never going to improve.

1073
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I've been through three months.

1074
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
No, guess what?

1075
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
What'd you get today?

1076
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
What'd you do today?

1077
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Same thing opposite, right?

1078
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
The opposite can happen, where someone thinks, well, I did something.

1079
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I did something today, so I'm good.

1080
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Man, no.

1081
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
No.

1082
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And the other collateral damages, I did good physical fitness today.

1083
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So I'm going to take tomorrow off.

1084
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Or I'm going to eat a, you know, a crappy meal.

1085
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yeah.

1086
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I'm going to get that pizza together.

1087
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Yeah.

1088
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Right?

1089
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
We don't want that.

1090
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I say, we, I mean, me.

1091
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And that why is that?

1092
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Because we've, we've, we've created this, this, this,

1093
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
pliable standard in our head that we move around based on our little feelings.

1094
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah.

1095
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
But, but this does this won't allow for it.

1096
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah.

1097
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
They need to keep yourself in check.

1098
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yeah.

1099
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
You need to keep yourself in check at all times.

1100
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And the reason you need to keep your check, self-in-check at all times.

1101
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
You need to impose discipline on your life because you will end up in a better situation.

1102
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
That you will end up in a better situation.

1103
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
You will end up with more freedom.

1104
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
This is where you're going to end up.

1105
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
You know, people, you, you talk about regret.

1106
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Right?

1107
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Oh, you go talk to people when they're, when they're dying on their deathbed.

1108
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And they're, they're, they're regret things they didn't do.

1109
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
There's nothing I can imagine you're going to regret more than when you look back at your life and you said,

1110
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You know, I didn't achieve what I could have achieved.

1111
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Yeah.

1112
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And there's only one way to maximize your achievement.

1113
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And that's the daily discipline, daily discipline.

1114
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And again, what we're talking about achievement, what are we talking about?

1115
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I'm not just talking about, I've worked more than you.

1116
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I made more money than you.

1117
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I produced more, I sold more cars.

1118
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
And that's not what I'm talking about.

1119
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I'm talking about what, what is your, what is your achievement?

1120
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Yeah.

1121
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
What is that you're trying to do?

1122
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I spent a bunch of time with my family and raised great kids.

1123
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Okay, that's what you want to do.

1124
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Put that on paper so you know what that looks like.

1125
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Maybe there is a financial there.

1126
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
It should be a financial aspect to it because you need to pay.

1127
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
You need to have a roof over your head.

1128
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You need to be able to feed your kids.

1129
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000
So you certainly should have a job of vocation aspect to grading yourself.

1130
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Are you doing what you should be doing that work?

1131
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Because if you're working hard at work, guess what?

1132
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
You're going to get promoted eventually.

1133
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Or you're going to find it.

1134
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
You're going to improve your skills to a point where you're more valuable.

1135
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And you can go find a different job somewhere else.

1136
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So that's got to be in there.

1137
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Because if what we allow ourselves to do is show up at work every day and just do what we need to do to get by.

1138
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I guess what, you never leave in that job.

1139
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
You'll be doing that thing forever.

1140
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
So it's physical fitness.

1141
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It's what you're eating.

1142
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Your fuel systems that you're putting into your body.

1143
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
It's the family, the effort.

1144
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children?

1145
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
What are you doing?

1146
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children?

1147
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Are you spending 20 minutes teaching them new vocabulary words so that they can articulate better?

1148
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So they can become a better leader when they get older.

1149
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Are you doing that?

1150
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Is that a big ask as a dad?

1151
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
As a mom?

1152
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Are you doing it?

1153
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Have you showed them how to escape a guillotine?

1154
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Have you?

1155
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Maybe you should.

1156
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Could you get caught in a guillotine?

1157
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
That's the street fight.

1158
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Right?

1159
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Street fight.

1160
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Gettings are common.

1161
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So have you, does your kid know how to escape a guillotine in a street fight?

1162
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
How much is it?

1163
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
How long will it take?

1164
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
You got to teach them today that takes 15 minutes, but you got to drill it.

1165
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Got to drill it every day until they kind of understand it.

1166
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So what have you invested in your kids today?

1167
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
What's the minimum standard?

1168
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Now you could think to yourself, well you know, I got my kid an iPad for Christmas.

1169
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That was an awesome gift, so I'm pretty much good to go.

1170
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Yeah.

1171
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
As a dad.

1172
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Right?

1173
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Does your kid care about that iPad compared to,

1174
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Are you fast forward three years where your kid's got an incredible vocabulary?

1175
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And can defend guillotines for right?

1176
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So how much of you invested in your family?

1177
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So these are the kind of things that we can set a moving goal post,

1178
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Where you can set a moving goal post that says,

1179
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I buy a if you get your kid an iPad with some apps on it, you're a good dad.

1180
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
That's a moving goal post.

1181
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Hey, if you can get your kid an iPad and they can get some educational stuff.

1182
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
You feel pretty good about a good job.

1183
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Is that a moving goal post?

1184
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Yes it is.

1185
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Because what they really need to know is have a better vocabulary.

1186
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
What they really need is interaction with you as a human being.

1187
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
So they can interact with other human beings in a more complete way.

1188
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
That's what we're doing.

1189
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
So you got your physical, you got your, okay mental.

1190
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
What are you, how much have you read today?

1191
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And I'm not talking about reading somebody's freaking Instagram post.

1192
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
That doesn't count.

1193
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Get negative credit for that.

1194
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
You're getting dumber when you do that.

1195
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So what are you doing?

1196
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
How many words did you learn today?

1197
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And by the way, this is brain maintenance too.

1198
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Because if you're not trying to learn new things,

1199
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
then your brain is deteriorating, just like your body will.

1200
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
So you got that aspect.

1201
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
What about your creative output?

1202
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
What have you done in that capacity?

1203
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Did you write us?

1204
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Did you draw a picture?

1205
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Did you write a story?

1206
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Did you come up with a guitar riff that kind of rocks?

1207
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Did you?

1208
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Right?

1209
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Did you?

1210
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Because you may or may not have.

1211
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
My guess is you didn't.

1212
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So what?

1213
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Have you done that today?

1214
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And we're, and by the way, if you think,

1215
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Oh, I took a cool picture for Instagram,

1216
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and I'm kind of giving myself artistic credit for output right there.

1217
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
No.

1218
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
No.

1219
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So, and then you start looking at all this stuff.

1220
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And you start adding it together, your time that you've invested in your work,

1221
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
and your family, and your friends, and you're trying to teach your kids something,

1222
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and you're trying to read something, and all of a sudden you're looking,

1223
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
you say, well, I don't have much time.

1224
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And then you look at yourself and say, wait a second,

1225
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
why did my time go to the day?

1226
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
What grade do I get today for time management?

1227
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Yeah.

1228
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
That's a big one.

1229
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Because did I spend time doing things that I got negative value?

1230
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Never mind, break even.

1231
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Actually, negative value.

1232
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yeah.

1233
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
And we don't have a grading system.

1234
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
We don't know what we're aiming at.

1235
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
We don't know what the potential is.

1236
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Because that's what's cool about this.

1237
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You read these definitions of high end,

1238
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
the outstanding, the eminently qualified Marine.

1239
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That is an unachievable human.

1240
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Yeah.

1241
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
It's an unachievable Marine.

1242
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
You will not be that good.

1243
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
You cannot hold all those categories.

1244
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
But let me tell you something that is no reason

1245
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
to not aspire

1246
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
to become the most eminently qualified human being

1247
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000
that you can become.

1248
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Just because it's an impossible path.

1249
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Just because it's a path with no end to it.

1250
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Just because you'll never reach the top of the mountain.

1251
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Ever, you will not.

1252
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You cannot.

1253
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Mmm.

1254
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Guess what?

1255
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That is no reason to stop.

1256
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Guess what?

1257
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Do you get to?

1258
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
You're going to get tapped out.

1259
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
There's always going to be someone that can tap you out.

1260
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Always.

1261
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Or 100% of the time.

1262
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
The best guys in the world get tapped out.

1263
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Yeah.

1264
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
The best guys in the world get tapped out.

1265
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Buchetcha.

1266
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Hot, hot your gracy.

1267
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Buchetcha is the best guy in the world.

1268
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
What happens?

1269
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
He goes in ghee and loses to hot your gracy.

1270
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Taped out.

1271
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Submitted.

1272
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Why is that?

1273
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Because somebody's always.

1274
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And what happened to Roger Gracy?

1275
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
By the way, when he fought Tim Kennedy.

1276
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
He got beat down.

1277
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So there's always.

1278
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
You're never going to get to the top of the mountain.

1279
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:22.000
But that is not a reason to not stop climbing.

1280
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Just because you're not going to reach the top of the mountain doesn't mean you stop climbing.

1281
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000
No.

1282
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Actually you climb herger.

1283
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
You see where you can get.

1284
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
But if you don't know what you're climbing.

1285
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000
If you don't understand the mountain, if you can't see the summit, you don't know where to climb.

1286
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And then you just look around and go, well, I'm going to slide down.

1287
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Because it takes physical and mental exertion to move up the mountain.

1288
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And if I don't even know where the top is, I'm just going to, I can't tell where I am.

1289
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I can't tell if I'm halfway up the mountain or the quarter with the mountain.

1290
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I can't tell if I'm close to the top.

1291
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Bottom top.

1292
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
It can't tell.

1293
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So there's enough reason for me just to sit around and do nothing.

1294
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Break out the donuts.

1295
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Not.

1296
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
The.

1297
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Okay, so the way you started this was with your Navy experience.

1298
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Yes.

1299
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
This is far as the valuations go.

1300
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
And it, okay, so this is essentially what it, what it kind of translated to me, what it was.

1301
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:19.000
In the Navy, the one that you were talking about was like everyone expected to get the high, the, the, the perfect score.

1302
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Right.

1303
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And now we started the standard and then in the Marine Corps one, it's kind of the opposite.

1304
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Well, no, the Navy once started off.

1305
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
When I first got in the Navy, basically everyone was a four point.

1306
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Oh, yeah.

1307
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Yeah.

1308
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Then they changed it because you need the force rank and I don't know when the Marine Corps or if they made that change,

1309
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
but but they did because that's the way it is now.

1310
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
They're force ranked for sure.

1311
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Yeah.

1312
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Okay, so the end of the point is just the two different standards, like common standards, right?

1313
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Where, you know, because you get this in other places to where it's like, oh, you know, it's just a, just here's your quarterly valuation and I just put force, you know,

1314
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
because I don't have any complaints about you kind of this.

1315
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
It doesn't necessarily reflect how dope you really are.

1316
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Or how dope you could be.

1317
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Yes, exactly right.

1318
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So it's just more of like, okay, so the ceiling is pretty low is what it is.

1319
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
By like a common like perception is far as the standard goes.

1320
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Then you got to have the opposite where it's like, oh, we all know, no, no, it's going to get a five.

1321
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Like we all just know that.

1322
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So we're, we're just kind of doing the best we can kind of thing.

1323
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And in that way is better for obvious reasons, but at the end of the day, it's like, when you say, oh, yeah, you can literally be like you're topping out.

1324
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Because as you get better and better, it's harder to get better and better.

1325
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Yes, you know, yes.

1326
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So if, but you won't even get to those upper levels,

1327
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
if that ceiling was so low and you're ripping four is all day, they're all year or whatever.

1328
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
So man, he's the, he's the place game super Mario Brothers.

1329
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You've heard that super Mario Brothers.

1330
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I've heard of it, but I've never, I've never, I've never, I've never, I've never played one single second of that particular video game.

1331
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000
All right.

1332
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Thank you, Bill. Okay.

1333
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I played Halo one time for about three minutes with some of the guys that wasn't my seal,

1334
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
but I didn't see it on the ceiling and then I just, I think was after.

1335
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Thought it was, they were really good at it, they murdered me a bunch of different ways.

1336
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And then I said, well, this is stupid, it's a video game I don't care if I want to go grapple.

1337
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Yeah.

1338
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Well, that part is, I would say that that's true, but the, the point still is consistent.

1339
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So super Mario Brothers, it's, okay, it's super Mario.

1340
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
There's a bunch of Mario Brothers.

1341
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
This is what it's super Mario Brothers.

1342
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And original Nintendo Entertainment system, I don't want to say 19.

1343
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
I understand.

1344
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I'm not in school.

1345
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So super Mario Brothers had four worlds, sorry, eight worlds, four levels, each world.

1346
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So 32 levels.

1347
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000
And you have an opportunity at various points in some levels to hit the warp, like the warp zone.

1348
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000
So you go down a pipe in its skips, like all these levels.

1349
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Right. So you could, you could essentially get through the game in maybe like, I don't know, six or eight levels.

1350
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Okay. If you worked, right.

1351
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
But if you chose not to warp, you would have to go through all 32 levels.

1352
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000
So I used to be able to go through all 32 levels, never dying one single time.

1353
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Like I got really, really good at that.

1354
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000
You're, for those of you that just listening and not seeing this on video, echo looks super proud of that last statement.

1355
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I mean, I was a little bit embarrassed for it, and it's cool. Anyway.

1356
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Okay. So levels, never dying.

1357
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Here's why that's, here's why that's significant though. It's far too far.

1358
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Everybody's got this because you can easily pass the game, save the princess by just warping.

1359
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And it's still real hard, but you got, you know, you only go through a few levels.

1360
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Compared to if you go through all the levels voluntarily.

1361
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
So once you save the princess by warping, it's like cool now you got to go through all the levels.

1362
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000
But if you can do that without dying, that's like that's super high level.

1363
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Right. It's far super Mario Brothers goes.

1364
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
So it's basically so comfortable.

1365
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
What's your point? So go back to this two standards.

1366
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Go back to the two standards.

1367
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
If you go for the standards like, oh yeah, everyone gets a kind of a 4.0 kind of thing.

1368
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
That's like passing the passing the game by warping.

1369
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It's true. Like man, you pass the game in one man damn. That's good.

1370
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
That's good by any standard really. You know, I can't complain about that.

1371
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
But you got to open up the standard a little bit more.

1372
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Go through all 32 levels. Then without dying, then you do it as quick as you can.

1373
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Kind of think. And if that standard kind of allows for all that, where you can't reach the top of the

1374
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Like the standard isn't saving the princess.

1375
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Standard is like something way greater. You seem to say.

1376
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
So it allows you to get better and be evaluated on that on that elevation.

1377
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Well, still not like capping out at a certain level. You seem to say.

1378
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
So what you got to do as far as the evaluation process goes. Okay, bro.

1379
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Look to Super Mario.

1380
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But there is this thing they discovered. It was like a glitch in the game where you could like go to this one level

1381
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
And do the thing with a turtle shell and keep jumping on it and get like a thousand men.

1382
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Which is kind of a step backwards in a way.

1383
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
But let's just say no.

1384
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Okay. How much time have you spent playing video games?

1385
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Well, imagine what you could have done with your life.

1386
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Yeah. Well, keep playing guitar. You could have played.

1387
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
You know, instruments could have mastered chess.

1388
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
You could have spoken another language.

1389
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Is that you're over here talking about how you did 32 levels in one minute by the way.

1390
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
This is a really low grade.

1391
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Well, come up with a system. Your grade is going to be low.

1392
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yes, as far as the achievement goes, yes, very low.

1393
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But as far as an evaluation process did all that translate it highly respect you.

1394
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Did J. Charles go ahead, man.

1395
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Did he kind of, yeah, something.

1396
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
There you go.

1397
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Look at that. You finally got that respect you on.

1398
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Keep in mind.

1399
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I was in fifth grade by the way. So, you know, a little bit different.

1400
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Was that a humble brag? Like, why did 32 levels?

1401
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
By the way, I was all the fifth grade.

1402
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
No, I think it was more of an aging thing. Actually, that wasn't a bragged all because in fifth grade.

1403
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
You could have been learning the language.

1404
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Yes, sir.

1405
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Yeah.

1406
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
We're doing full-up. So, actually, it was doing full-ups in fifth grade.

1407
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
That's legit.

1408
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Yeah. Big-to.

1409
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I thought check.

1410
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Well, okay.

1411
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
The lesson here is the bottom line.

1412
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000
We are looking to step up.

1413
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000
We are looking to two to become better.

1414
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Truly better.

1415
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
So, what do you got for us? How can you help us get better?

1416
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yeah.

1417
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
To stay on the path. So, actually, that brings up a good point because we're on the path called

1418
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Right?

1419
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
You, we would ever, all on the path and saying, we're even saying we're on the path straight up,

1420
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
saying it.

1421
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
But like, what is the path though?

1422
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I mean, sure, there's some things.

1423
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Yeah.

1424
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
You know, we can go through a Jiu-Jitsu, of course, as part of it.

1425
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
But you don't have any valuation kind of standard.

1426
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So, you say it.

1427
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000
So, yeah, I think that'll be how action I'm really looking forward to it.

1428
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Yeah.

1429
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Be honest with you.

1430
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Yeah.

1431
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
On the last Jiu-Jitsu, yes.

1432
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000
That's on the path.

1433
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Here's, okay.

1434
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
So, this will help us prep that at the very least prepare to be officially on the path

1435
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
and be evaluated.

1436
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
See, get a G.

1437
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yeah.

1438
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Right?

1439
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Step one, get a G.

1440
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Step one, B.

1441
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Get a rash guard.

1442
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
So, where do we get our Gs?

1443
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
We get a Gs from origin.

1444
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
OriginMain.com.

1445
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Best Gs in the world, factually, actually, the new Rift is at,

1446
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Oh, that's all right.

1447
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That's right.

1448
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Rift is live.

1449
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Rift.

1450
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
This is like, when you put a Rift G on and then go back to your old Gs.

1451
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Yeah.

1452
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Like, I said this in the game.

1453
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Yeah.

1454
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
This is non-starter.

1455
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
You're going to be mad at your old G.

1456
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
You're going to be trade your old G.

1457
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
You're going to wonder why anyone ever made a G, like they used to make them.

1458
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Yeah.

1459
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
But then again, then you're going to, then if you choose, you can revisit or you can visit

1460
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
that video that Pete put out about like, you know, how amazing.

1461
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Yeah.

1462
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
How amazing.

1463
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
There's like, okay, that's why they didn't make it because what they went through to make

1464
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
it.

1465
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Yeah.

1466
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And then as usual, we are standing on the shoulders of giants because you always look at the

1467
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
way things have evolved and you have to take those iterative steps.

1468
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
No one just thinks of the iPhone.

1469
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Right.

1470
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Right.

1471
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
And somebody had to make a bunch of other phones before that.

1472
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh, yeah.

1473
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
And then even consider iPhone, like, right now, like, what is the newest one?

1474
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I don't know.

1475
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
X or something.

1476
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Tanned.

1477
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Right.

1478
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000
The X is the tan.

1479
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
You don't know what I mean.

1480
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
No, I don't know.

1481
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000
The one in six years from now is going to make this X tan one.

1482
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
It'd be like, oh, that's the old school.

1483
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
You know, like, non evolved, meanderthal one.

1484
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
That's what's going to feel like.

1485
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
That's what your old gui will feel like.

1486
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Yes.

1487
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
A non evolved meanderthal gui.

1488
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Yeah.

1489
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And then put on the rift.

1490
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Oh, yeah.

1491
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
So yeah, you can get the, you can get the guis.

1492
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
You can get the rash cards.

1493
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
You can get other clothing.

1494
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
You can also get supplements, which right now I am taking a look at.

1495
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I am taking a ton of joint warfare.

1496
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Yeah, I heard many.

1497
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Which is not that big of a deal.

1498
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Because let's face it.

1499
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I'm walking around.

1500
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
You know, we're going to be fine.

1501
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
It's not that big of a deal when people do feel like, oh, no, what happened?

1502
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Don't worry.

1503
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Everything is fine.

1504
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
I did, however, up the joint warfare.

1505
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And continue the krill oil path.

1506
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
But the, the joint warfare, you can feel it in there.

1507
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Can feel it like little micro nano robots in there.

1508
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Repairing stuff.

1509
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yep.

1510
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Now, you have to, you know, I know it happened with your bicep.

1511
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
But the last time I heard my other knee, it was a disaster.

1512
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And this one is already.

1513
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
So, anyways, get your joint warfare.

1514
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I remember you, well, and, I mean, of course, I remember it because it was as

1515
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
recent as today where you're like, oh, I'm like, Wolverine.

1516
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Wolverine.

1517
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I feel so fast.

1518
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
But I'm like, yeah, well, I dig it.

1519
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
It's probably the joint warfare, but yeah, man.

1520
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
The joint warfare has to do something to do with it.

1521
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But also, there's some, there's definitely, I definitely have been blessed with some sort of

1522
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
ability to, to heal up a little quicker.

1523
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Yeah, I'm not.

1524
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Yeah, I think, yeah.

1525
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Thankfully, knock on wood.

1526
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That's what it seems like today.

1527
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Cool.

1528
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Well, also we have milk, which is additional protein that happens to be delicious.

1529
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And tastes like a dessert straight up.

1530
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So, it goes with that also where you kid milk.

1531
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Same deal, just for the kids.

1532
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
The same deal.

1533
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000
But they have strawberry, where you kid milk, which is literally the best tasting thing in the

1534
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
world.

1535
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Yeah.

1536
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
That has strawberry flavor, because men is still my favorite.

1537
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And we do have strawberry adult milk coming out.

1538
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I teeny that.

1539
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And it is ridiculous.

1540
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
What is T and E?

1541
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Test an evaluate.

1542
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
So I got the little package in the mail.

1543
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Yeah.

1544
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And it was so good.

1545
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
So yeah, you can get that.

1546
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
You know, also discipline.

1547
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And discipline go.

1548
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
So discipline, if you are going to train jiu-jitsu, or you're going to do something that's

1549
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
going to require physical output.

1550
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And at the same time, mental alertness.

1551
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
So that's, for me, it was always about hey, pre-mission.

1552
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Because when you're on a mission, you have to be physically ready.

1553
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And you have to be mentally ready.

1554
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
You need both aspects.

1555
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
And so that's why we made discipline.

1556
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So you're ready for those things.

1557
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And then also, we have discipline go, which is a capsule.

1558
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And the reason I made this is because sometimes I'm going to speak or I'm going to work with a company.

1559
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I'm going to be in a boardroom all day.

1560
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And I want to bring my A game.

1561
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And I don't want to have to drink a whole beverage.

1562
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Because I don't need it at that time.

1563
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So I talked to Pete Bryan.

1564
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
We took the elements from discipline, drink, put them into the capsule.

1565
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000
So that way, if you need to bring your A game, you can get your discipline go.

1566
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And that will get you across the board.

1567
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And so we'll a little bit of jocquawaite.

1568
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Yeah, it's like going to the original, the original T that jocquaw was into.

1569
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Yeah.

1570
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Just kind of, you know, white T it's, you know, at first, but now sort of a stable.

1571
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's like synonymous, you know, jocquawaite.

1572
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Yeah, it's just, it's synonymous with good taste.

1573
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
It's synonymous with 8,000 pound deadlift.

1574
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
So there's that big time.

1575
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Also, the T is available at jocquaw store.

1576
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Because yes, jocquaw has a store, which we already know.

1577
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000
But that's a good place to visit to stay in the game to represent while you're in the game.

1578
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Sure.

1579
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
If you want T shirts, we've got some lightweight hoodies rolling, rocking and rolling.

1580
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Hmm.

1581
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
There are a lot of good evaluations in that one.

1582
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
No comment.

1583
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Yeah, because you haven't put one on yet.

1584
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Because you haven't given me one.

1585
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
A lot well, you know, let's face it.

1586
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
You kind of deserve that one.

1587
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And it's also changing minds of people who are originally,

1588
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
we're really signing off.

1589
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
It's special forces over here.

1590
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I like it.

1591
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
It's great.

1592
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
You know what?

1593
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Hey, the truth be told they came out really good.

1594
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Just even like the fit, the design, the date.

1595
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
There's someone that just gave out on the other night.

1596
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Yes, there it is.

1597
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
One of them, there's two of it.

1598
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
There's two.

1599
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Okay.

1600
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It's right.

1601
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
You can get truckers hats.

1602
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Yeah, patches on there.

1603
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Yeah, much other stuff.

1604
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Yeah, bunch of cool stuff.

1605
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yeah, if you want to jocquaw store.com, if you want to represent while you're on the path.

1606
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
While you're being evaluated, that might be one of the evaluation scenarios.

1607
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Well, you know, you're uniform.

1608
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Come on.

1609
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Anyway, I guess if someone's just a complete slob,

1610
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Yeah, then maybe they do need to step it up.

1611
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Yeah, somebody, yeah.

1612
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Okay, maybe uniform will be judged, but I doubt it.

1613
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Well, okay.

1614
01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Well, don't be wearing a stinky guillo.

1615
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Oh, no.

1616
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
That's a uniform violation big dime.

1617
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Yes, sir.

1618
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Oh, you didn't want to wash your gays.

1619
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So now we all have to suffer.

1620
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Yeah.

1621
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Yeah, you're going to get punished.

1622
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
What if don't do that?

1623
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Hey, the the rift key, the cool thing.

1624
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You can wash with your normal clothes.

1625
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah.

1626
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Because it's and it dry.

1627
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
It's not like when you put a regular key in.

1628
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
And it's like you threw a 40 pound weight.

1629
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:34.000
You're washing your see.

1630
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Yeah.

1631
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

1632
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Because it'll bunch.

1633
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
That's all right.

1634
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
And it takes nine hours to dry, not the rift.

1635
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000
The rift dries with your normal quick dry t-shirts.

1636
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Just about.

1637
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Did you see the video Pete had when he's going into the fibers like he takes a while in fiber.

1638
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And he's like breaking in.

1639
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
And it's hard to break.

1640
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
He puts the two and you can't even break it.

1641
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
The whole gear is that.

1642
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Yeah.

1643
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.74
to the podcast that we haven't already.

1644
01:45:54.74 --> 01:45:57.98
That is for black with a better term,

1645
01:45:57.98 --> 01:46:00.46
it's important, it's something.

1646
01:46:00.46 --> 01:46:04.06
It's not nothing, like to subscribe versus if you didn't subscribe.

1647
01:46:04.06 --> 01:46:06.86
Yeah, don't forget about also the Warrior Kid podcast.

1648
01:46:06.86 --> 01:46:11.86
So this is one where your kids can actually be educated.

1649
01:46:12.26 --> 01:46:14.02
This is quality time with your kids.

1650
01:46:14.02 --> 01:46:15.76
You sit there and listen to Warrior Kid podcast

1651
01:46:15.76 --> 01:46:18.22
is that a driving your car and you're playing

1652
01:46:18.22 --> 01:46:20.82
some lame music for them

1653
01:46:20.82 --> 01:46:25.82
or you're having them listen to some dumb podcasts.

1654
01:46:25.90 --> 01:46:27.94
No, have them listen to Warrior Kid podcast.

1655
01:46:27.94 --> 01:46:28.90
They're gonna learn from it.

1656
01:46:28.90 --> 01:46:30.18
You're gonna learn from it.

1657
01:46:31.42 --> 01:46:32.62
Just check it out.

1658
01:46:32.62 --> 01:46:33.46
It'll help.

1659
01:46:33.46 --> 01:46:34.58
It will help your kids.

1660
01:46:34.58 --> 01:46:37.06
It's got a Texas morning from a buddy who said,

1661
01:46:37.06 --> 01:46:39.42
he had a, this is going into the book,

1662
01:46:39.42 --> 01:46:44.06
but he had a nephew who had been through,

1663
01:46:44.06 --> 01:46:47.94
you know, a rough time and 10 years old,

1664
01:46:47.94 --> 01:46:49.50
got him the Warrior Kid book, boom.

1665
01:46:49.50 --> 01:46:53.54
Warrior Kid, he's a, that book completely changed

1666
01:46:53.54 --> 01:46:56.38
the trajectory of my nephew's life.

1667
01:46:57.50 --> 01:47:00.30
And it doesn't get much better than that.

1668
01:47:00.30 --> 01:47:02.86
But the Warrior Kid podcast has the same messages

1669
01:47:02.86 --> 01:47:04.50
in a podcast format.

1670
01:47:04.50 --> 01:47:06.50
So check that out and also while you're there,

1671
01:47:06.50 --> 01:47:10.26
you can check out some of that IrishOaksRanch.com

1672
01:47:10.26 --> 01:47:13.42
where we have a Warrior Kid that is making soap,

1673
01:47:13.42 --> 01:47:18.42
started a business, making soap on his farm from goat milk

1674
01:47:18.42 --> 01:47:21.86
and that goat milk will help you stay clean.

1675
01:47:21.86 --> 01:47:22.66
Just do it clean.

1676
01:47:22.66 --> 01:47:24.46
My daughter has a question for Uncle Jake.

1677
01:47:24.46 --> 01:47:25.26
Oh, okay.

1678
01:47:25.26 --> 01:47:26.02
I can't tell where I'll send it to him.

1679
01:47:26.02 --> 01:47:27.18
Yeah, yeah, he's a cute boy.

1680
01:47:27.18 --> 01:47:28.70
Uncle Jake, you know, we'll get that sorted.

1681
01:47:28.70 --> 01:47:32.38
My also, you too, we have a YouTube channel.

1682
01:47:32.38 --> 01:47:35.86
If you're interested in the video version of this podcast,

1683
01:47:35.86 --> 01:47:39.86
we'll see what Jockel looks like while he gives it to you straight.

1684
01:47:39.86 --> 01:47:41.26
And you know, that's where you go.

1685
01:47:41.26 --> 01:47:44.18
There's also some of Echo's legit videos on there

1686
01:47:44.18 --> 01:47:46.10
that he calls legit videos.

1687
01:47:46.10 --> 01:47:46.94
Wow.

1688
01:47:46.94 --> 01:47:50.38
It feels really good about him and just like he feels good about

1689
01:47:50.38 --> 01:47:51.94
getting through 32 levels.

1690
01:47:51.94 --> 01:47:53.94
Yeah.

1691
01:47:53.94 --> 01:47:55.10
Oh, yeah.

1692
01:47:55.10 --> 01:47:55.74
Gained.

1693
01:47:55.74 --> 01:47:56.30
Yeah.

1694
01:47:56.30 --> 01:47:56.90
Sometimes.

1695
01:47:56.90 --> 01:47:58.54
I feel like it's psychological warfare.

1696
01:47:58.54 --> 01:48:00.94
If you need a little, if everyone that looks for an alarm,

1697
01:48:00.94 --> 01:48:02.54
it says, oh, really be great to have an alarm.

1698
01:48:02.54 --> 01:48:04.10
But Jockel, making an alarm, that's the alarm.

1699
01:48:04.10 --> 01:48:04.94
Psychological warfare.

1700
01:48:04.94 --> 01:48:07.26
It's on iTunes, Google Play, MP3 platforms.

1701
01:48:07.26 --> 01:48:09.18
And not, not only will it wake you up in the morning,

1702
01:48:09.18 --> 01:48:10.46
but if you're having a moment of weakness,

1703
01:48:10.46 --> 01:48:14.98
because you want to eat a donut, this will 100% effective.

1704
01:48:14.98 --> 01:48:17.50
Stop you from eating a donut, press play.

1705
01:48:17.50 --> 01:48:18.82
Psychological warfare.

I just talked about way the warrior kid.

1733
01:49:27.10 --> 01:49:28.10
That's one.

1734
01:49:28.10 --> 01:49:29.10
That's book one.

1735
01:49:29.10 --> 01:49:32.10
The next book, same series called Mark's Mission.

1736
01:49:32.10 --> 01:49:37.10
And then there's the third book in the series, which is called Way the Warrior Kid,

1737
01:49:37.10 --> 01:49:39.10

If you want it, order it now that way I can print enough copies for everyone.

1740
01:49:49.10 --> 01:49:52.38
That's called the big pre-order that I used to make fun of my publisher.

1741
01:49:52.38 --> 01:49:57.22
But guess who the publisher is now me so I have to know how many to print.

1742
01:49:57.22 --> 01:50:02.62
So if you want it, order it now and it's going to come out May 28th.

Also, we have Mikey in the Dragons.

1745
01:50:05.86 --> 01:50:09.86
This is a book to help kids figure out how to overcome fear.

1746
01:50:09.86 --> 01:50:13.86
Sure, your kids could read some book where you could read some book to your little kid.

1747
01:50:13.86 --> 01:50:21.86
That's about things that don't matter in the world or you could read them a book that helps them actually learn how to overcome their fears.

1748
01:50:21.86 --> 01:50:22.86
That's Mikey in the Dragons.

1749
01:50:22.86 --> 01:50:23.86
Great story.

1750
01:50:23.86 --> 01:50:24.86
Awesome art.

1751
01:50:24.86 --> 01:50:26.86
Very awesome.

1752
01:50:26.86 --> 01:50:27.86
Yes.

1753
01:50:27.86 --> 01:50:30.86
The Disponicals Freedom Field Manual.

1754
01:50:30.86 --> 01:50:32.86
Give the gift of discipline.

1755
01:50:32.86 --> 01:50:33.86
Yep.

1756
01:50:33.86 --> 01:50:34.86
That's that's all there is to say.

1757
01:50:34.86 --> 01:50:40.86
It's the book that's going to show people that you, it's going to show people the path.

1758
01:50:40.86 --> 01:50:44.86
If you want that on audio form, then that's not on audible.

1759
01:50:44.86 --> 01:50:48.86
It's on iTunes Amazon, music, Google Play and other MP3 platforms.

1760
01:50:48.86 --> 01:50:50.86
Then you got extreme ownership, which I wrote with my brother,

1761
01:50:50.86 --> 01:50:58.86
Lave Babin, where we took the leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield and explain how those can be applied to your business and life.

1762
01:50:58.86 --> 01:51:03.86
And one of those lessons in that book is called the Decautomy Leadership.

1763
01:51:03.86 --> 01:51:09.86
The Decautomy Leadership seemed to be as we continue to work with businesses, companies, leaders around the world.

1764
01:51:09.86 --> 01:51:15.86
We found that the biggest problem that they had was balancing the Decautomy of leadership.

1765
01:51:15.86 --> 01:51:23.86
And when you can't balance the Decautomy of leadership, the multiple Decautomy of leadership, when you can't balance them, they derail your whole team.

1766
01:51:23.86 --> 01:51:31.86
So get extreme ownership and get yourself the Decautomy of leadership so that you can understand how to truly apply these things effectively.

1767
01:51:31.86 --> 01:51:37.86
Eshelon Front, that's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.

1768
01:51:37.86 --> 01:51:44.86
We have an outstanding team of outstanding guys, Lave Babin, J.P. to Nell, Dave Burke, Mike Cochran,

1769
01:51:44.86 --> 01:51:49.86
or sorry Flynn Cochran, Mike Surreli, Mike Bima, and now Jason Gardner.

1770
01:51:49.86 --> 01:51:59.86
If you need help at your company with any problem, because every problem that you have in your business is a leadership problem.

1771
01:51:59.86 --> 01:52:03.86
That's what we do. We solve problems through leadership, Eshelon Front, dot com.

1772
01:52:03.86 --> 01:52:07.86
We have the muster coming up Chicago, 2324th.

1773
01:52:07.86 --> 01:52:12.86

1775
01:52:19.86 --> 01:52:23.86
And then December 4th and 5th in Sydney, extreme ownership dot com.

1776
01:52:23.86 --> 01:52:28.86
If you want to register do it quickly, because all of them are going to sell out.

1777
01:52:28.86 --> 01:52:36.86
EF online, this is for those of you that can't make it to a muster, or you can't bring your whole company to a muster, because it's expensive.

1778
01:52:36.86 --> 01:52:42.86
That's what we made EF online. This is online interactive leadership training.

1779
01:52:42.86 --> 01:52:50.86
It's me and it's everyone on the Eshelon Front team training leadership through technology.

1780
01:52:50.86 --> 01:52:55.86
It's it's available direct to consumer if you're just one person you want to get in the game, or you got a company.

1781
01:52:55.86 --> 01:53:02.86
You can get it through enterprise, but if you want to check it out go to ef online dot com.

1782
01:53:02.86 --> 01:53:11.86
And of course, on top of that, we have EF over watch where we're taking leaders, proven leaders from spec ops and from combat aviation,

1783
01:53:11.86 --> 01:53:16.86
putting them placing them into companies in the civilian sector.

1784
01:53:16.86 --> 01:53:21.86
Don't always hire someone based just because they have experience in a field.

1785
01:53:21.86 --> 01:53:31.86
Actually hire them for their leadership capability because it is a lot easier to teach someone an industry than it is to teach someone leadership.

1786
01:53:31.86 --> 01:53:35.86
So get yourself a qualified proven leader.

1787
01:53:35.86 --> 01:53:40.86
Go to ef over watch dot com if that's what you need.

1788
01:53:40.86 --> 01:53:43.86
And if you want to hang out with us a little bit more.

1789
01:53:43.86 --> 01:53:49.86
Because you're just not satisfied with 500 hours of us on this podcast.

1790
01:53:49.86 --> 01:53:52.86
Well, then we are on the interwebs.

1791
01:53:52.86 --> 01:53:53.86
We are on Twitter.

1792
01:53:53.86 --> 01:53:57.86
We are on Instagram and of course we are on that.

1793
01:53:57.86 --> 01:54:00.86
They see book dot boi.

1794
01:54:00.86 --> 01:54:08.86
Echo is at echo Charles and I am at jocca willing and thanks to all the people that make this podcast possible.

1795
01:54:08.86 --> 01:54:10.86
And by that, I mean,

1796
01:54:10.86 --> 01:54:22.86
not some big corporate sponsor by that. I mean our police, our military, our law enforcement, our firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

1797
01:54:22.86 --> 01:54:25.86
correctional officers board patrol and yes, secret service.

1798
01:54:25.86 --> 01:54:28.86
All you first responders.

1799
01:54:28.86 --> 01:54:35.86
All you uniform your service and your sacrifice allow us to live.

1800
01:54:35.86 --> 01:54:43.86
To live a life of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which is what we're doing here and everyone else out there.

1801
01:54:43.86 --> 01:54:45.86
Check yourself.

1802
01:54:45.86 --> 01:54:48.86
You evaluate yourself honestly.

1803
01:54:48.86 --> 01:54:54.86
Are you doing what you can do to be better?

1804
01:54:54.86 --> 01:54:56.86
Are you working as hard as you can?

1805
01:54:56.86 --> 01:55:01.86
And that just doesn't mean work as in your vocation or your job.

1806
01:55:01.86 --> 01:55:06.86
Are you working to be a better father or mother or daughter or son?

1807
01:55:06.86 --> 01:55:10.86
Are you maximizing opportunities?

1808
01:55:10.86 --> 01:55:16.86
And again, not just professional opportunities, but opportunities to help someone.

1809
01:55:16.86 --> 01:55:22.86
To teach someone, to coach someone, to make someone else better.

1810
01:55:22.86 --> 01:55:30.86
Are you maximizing the opportunities to spend time with your family, to strengthen the relationships you have?

1811
01:55:30.86 --> 01:55:38.86
Are you maximizing the opportunities to make the members of your family better?

1812
01:55:38.86 --> 01:55:51.86
Are you every day doing everything you can to live the most emanate worthy life you can live, ask yourself those questions?

1813
01:55:51.86 --> 01:56:07.86
And when you realize that you fall short, that we all fall short. When you realize that, then get yourself on the path to correct those shortfalls by going out there.

1814
01:56:07.86 --> 01:56:11.86
And getting after it.

1815
01:56:11.86 --> 01:56:21.86
And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco. Out.
