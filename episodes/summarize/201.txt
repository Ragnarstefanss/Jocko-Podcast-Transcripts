I let those emotions all go so then when it did happen it was like I guess when you do this idea of like preparing right where your it's almost like I knew this was coming like you hear people like I knew it I knew it right like I had no idea and so to have something shock your system that much I think it kind of rewires you where you're kind of waiting for that next shock to the system and you know you lead on throughout the book and and I've had other things that have that have happened since where I know like there no one is void of having something happen you know whether it's random in nature I've had a lot of random crappy things happened to me you know over the last several years I guess it's similar again this is something I just talked about with Jim Sersley who was on the last podcast was in Vietnam and the range of level of fear that guys have going into combat there's some people that are scared they're like they think they're gonna die right and I'm I'm definitely a a jumpier person you know like I hear something like what happened you know we're before I was not like that I was kind of like um you heard something you know you talk a little bit about that more here you say the fear and paranoia that follow in the wake of grief can create a tremendous roadblock it stunts our personal growth and darkens our overall sense of well-being some people respond to unexpected and trying situations with passive acquiescence and others with fire and fury I responded by heightening my vigilance after Travis's death I found myself compelled to be wary I was always on the lookout for the next great tragedy to befall me this hurled me down some very dark and troublesome paths from panic attacks to self-destructive behaviors but also led me to some amazing gifts like recovering my sense of humor and living with intention what self-destructive behaviors did you pick up I mean I think you know self-destructive in a way that you know I stopped kind of taking care of myself you know and they're like what could you have you know the image in your head of someone with dying of stage four cancer like she just she didn't look like that and what were you thinking this whole time I was very pragmatic I was like my mom's dying in eight months I did not um my dad on the other side was like I'm not listening to that like there's there's miracles happen every day we just got to you know stay the course things will see if there's trials you know they're trying all sorts of different holistic diets and and I was very much um supportive of that let's try everything and anything and I would be like okay Janet like like I roll like why don't we just try to get like a thousand people at the run next year you know that would be like a cool goal and there was all these people around much different scene than the chaos around Travis's death I'm sitting there and I'm like I need you to do this this is my ulogy I want you to go home go back and make these revisions on the computer print it back like I was running the show I'm like I'm in charge I'm taking over I'm going to make sure all this is getting done and we do the most beautiful tribute to this woman and after that I kept going just with that same like do do do like grind every single day whatever it may be and then it was that Christmas party where and my husband again you know he's he he has some insight yeah can you give me an example of just one so you know there's like the breathing techniques of course like for me a lot of it was like the breathing because I would get to like these peaked peaked feelings of anxiety where you know it was like fighter flight I've experienced like when something really bad happens, like when I've lost friends and I wake up in the morning and for like three, literally three seconds, you know, the alarm clock goes off and I, you know, shut off the alarm clock and I, and everything's like totally normal for like for three seconds. and and it and it doesn't come as as often but like you said you know 50 60 years out a service member talking about his friends like that's never going to go away and nor what I wanted to exactly exactly you continue on here like anyone who is received a jarring knock at the door literal or figurative and that's what's important and you again since I'm jumping around this book you know there's the metaphorical knock at the door that a service member's family can receive but the knock in the door can be anything sure anything that is unexpected in your life and everyone's going to get him in your life you're going to get a knock at the door that you want to do what your mom did which slammed the door and don't let it come in but it's coming when I played the video that part for some reason when you you're like two mice on and it's you know and especially if you have kids you're like oh man you know you're sending your kid off into the crazy world you know kind of on his own it's like man it kind of like it's not more runny right which I probably had some conversations with like that about with my kids you know where you know my daughters they'll say like I just don't feel like doing anything right now it was like well that means you need to do something but it was that each and every day and I got to the point where I'm like I'm having mental health issues right now like this is not just a isolated event like something's something's happening here and to have me go sit on a couch with a therapist was like for me that was that was a big deal and a big deal because you thought you're too you're too strong for this you know it And I think that's why my dad's just like, I'm going to stand out in this driveway, you know, with Colonel Gardner, because he's just like, and then the rest is like, all these women and people are coming up like, what do you need? I don't subscribe to anybody that thinks that your physical health is not 100% tied to your mental health like you know I used to think my dad was incredibly insensitive when I would try to talk to him about like you know ailments of the mind and he would tie it all back to like you know well if you ran or well they broke down some of your outtakes and just did like it's like a minute long like wait is it bloopers it's not bloopers it's like thoughts from jaca like no it's cool and I hit it for a while I didn't tell my husband and tell my friend like I told no one because I'm just like so you know I was like you don't want your husband to say shut up I'm tired exactly what I was like has time so I didn't he's like I thought it was really like heavily focused on the military he's like these are like my key grips and they were like Yeah, I mean, my, I remember in high school, my girlfriends and I, we follow him around the Philadelphia area to his wrestling matches and we were like his main cheering squad in the front row and I'm like, that's my brother, the all-american wrestler, you know, I was so proud of him and it was, it was really cool to grow up with someone that even he was younger than me but that I could look up to so much, you know, and I think at the end of the day he helped me from not going too far off the rails, you know? I failed a plenty of things rather it was because I didn't care enough about anything to give it much effort I was sometimes apathetic Travis was ambitious Travis was the ambitious goal oriented one I was just coasting through life after he died and then my mom died I had a major wake-up call now I feel I feel compelled to take advantage of the time I have left on this earth to lead a life they both can be proud of and I think that's a good place to stop on my readings from this book to lead a life that they can be proud of because that message right there is just a powerful message and it's a one that I know that I think about every single day every single day I think about that and mind you we've only covered like a third of this book right here right there are stories and lessons from Heather and from Amy and like I said hopefully I can have them on but you know the doctors tell us like you've got eight months to live with treatment if you decide to go to the treatment route it's just gonna help prolong you we're gonna give you about eight months my mom never really took that and was like she didn't do one of these I've got eight months to live this is what I'm gonna do she was just like and he's he's he's he's people like you gonna run the marathon he's like I'll never run a marathon again he's like I run to live my life like it's all it's all for maintenance for him I'm dying here on Christmas night and and it was my husband being like in you know he's like shut up you're not dying I'm tired and it was hearing those words like I'm tired I'm like and I know what I know the reasoning behind it if I can look back and like psychoanalyze myself when Travis was in Iraq I was not worried about him and when he was there the first time when he was there the second time even though I knew the second deployment was different I was aware of that because my husband told me he's like hey this is gonna be different you know I've had conversations with your brother
