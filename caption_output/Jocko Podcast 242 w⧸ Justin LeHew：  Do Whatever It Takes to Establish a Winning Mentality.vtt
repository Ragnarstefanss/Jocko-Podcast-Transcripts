00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Pondcast number 242 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to gunnery Sergeant Justin D. Lehu United States Marine Corps.

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For extraordinary heroism as amphibious assault, platoon sergeant company A, first battalion, second Marines, task force, tarua.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
First Marine Expeditionary Force in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom on 23 and 24 March 2003.

5
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As regimental combat team to attack north towards Amnazarea Iraqi, lead elements of the battalion came under heavy enemy fire.

6
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When the beleaguered United States Army 507th maintenance company Convoy was spotted in the distance, gunnery sergeant Lehu and his crew were dispatched to rescue the soldiers.

7
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Under constant enemy fire, he led the rescue team to the soldiers.

8
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
With total disregard for his own welfare, he assisted the evacuation effort of four soldiers to whom were critically wounded.

9
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
While still receiving enemy fire, he climbed back into his vehicle and immediately began suppressing enemy infantry.

10
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:47.000
During the subsequent company attack on the eastern bridge over the Fratees River, gunnery sergeant Lehu continuously exposed himself to winering enemy fire during the three hour urban firefight.

11
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000
His courageous battlefield presence inspired his Marines to fight a determined foe and allow him to position his platoons heavy machine guns to repelled numerous waves of attackers.

12
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In the midst of the battle and amphibious assault vehicle was destroyed, killing or wounding all its occupants gunnery sergeant Lehu immediately moved to recover the nine Marines.

13
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
He again exposed himself to a barrage of fire as he worked for nearly an hour recovering casualties from the wreckage.

14
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:45.000
By his outstanding display of decisive leadership, unlimited courage in the face of heavy enemy fire and utmost devotion to duty gunnery sergeant Lehu reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

15
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And that is a citation about one episode in one Marine's life.

16
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And it doesn't explain everything in that Marine's life nor does it explain everything about the Marine Corps.

17
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But it does give us a glimpse into what Marines do and what our American servicemen are capable of but it's only a glimpse.

18
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And you know these citations throughout the military when you go to different military bases and I've been to many many military bases around the country and around the world these citations of heroic awards.

19
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:08.000
They're posted in various places around the base on the walls and the classrooms on the quarterdecks and throughout my career starting as a young young kid.

20
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I would stop and I would read through these these citations and I would always wish to myself.

21
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I would always wish that I could meet these men and I could talk to them and I could learn from them and I could see what they were what they were really like.

22
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And with that in mind it is an absolute honor today to have that opportunity as Sergeant Major retired Justin Lehu is joining us to share the experiences that he had and the lessons that he learned in his service and in his life.

23
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Justin.

24
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm honored to have you here. Thanks for coming out. It's honored to be here with you today.

25
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I know we were talking a little bit about this, you know, the opportunity some of the people that have come on this podcast is just unbelievable to capture their lessons, you know, from guys that were on Tarlar, Ewo Jima and just incredible and it's it's an honor for me to sit here and and be able to capture some of these lessons for people not just not just soldiers not just Marines but just people.

26
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So that we can learn.

27
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Let's um, let's start at the beginning. Let's start it where you came from. So you were born in Columbus Grove, Ohio is that right?

28
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I'm a scroval, Ohio, a small little farm community, about 2,000 people. I don't think it's been up or down of 100 over the past 100 years this up there. It kind of was like any Norman Rockwell painting that you would ever say it was a great place to grow up when I was younger it was a place you didn't lock your doors. It was a place where parents told you to be in by the time the straight lights came on. It truly was like the fabric of America.

29
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You grew up playing little league baseball, pony league baseball. You grew up knowing every kid in the two schools that were in town because it was kind of like a little northern Ireland. It was either Protestants and Catholics wasn't anything else. It was kind of those two choices and for grades one through eight. There was the Catholic school that was on the other side of the railroad tracks and then there was the public school and then you knew by sports and by your neighbors.

30
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You knew everybody and it didn't matter if it was K through 12. You knew the kindergarteners because you were to school with their brothers and sisters. It was a really tight, very hard working community.

31
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now is that where your dad and mom were from originally?

32
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Dad was from a place called Front Row over Virginia right at the northern end of the entrance to the Skyline Drive. It was right there and then my mother was from Columbus, Gerobo, Ohio. My dad was in the army drafted in the army and was on June 6, 1944 part of the 29th Infantry as I believe one of the older PFCs at the age of 28 coming out of the front.

33
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:57.000
He definitely was. He came out of the front end of that LCP at that fire of the German 352 and overlooking the Blossom, Omaha Beach and then made a live all the way to St. Low and all the way to the end of the war.

34
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:13.000
When he got back, he took a job in Baltimore, Maryland at the Chrysler Corporation and my mom's brother happened to be working there. He started going back to Columbus, Gerobo, Ohio on some little excursions.

35
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:39.000
There was quite a difference between mom and dad. There was about 15 years difference. Dad was a farmer and this was a farm community. He would come back and then he would help work the snarrow family, whether it was small farms, whether it was help Mr. Snarrow or anybody else, drive his busing firm. He would do all that and when he'd be out there to tell one of the thing, my mom was about five or whatever when they first met.

36
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
He used to bring lemonade out to the guys working in the field and he was just joking with her one day and he said, when you go up, I'm going to marry you.

37
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Then he went on to not do that. He went in the infantry drafted and he came back and while he was working in Chrysler in 1947, he took a lunch break.

38
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
He was walking down town Baltimore and he was not fulfilled at that job. He said, I saw a snappy guy in an army looking uniform but he had different patches that I never seen.

39
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He put this sign in the street and said, come inside and talk to me about the brand new United States Air Force.

40
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:28.000
My father went inside and he talked with the recruiter and the recruiter asked him, so was there anything during the war that you never really got to do?

41
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
He said, I always wanted to go to Japan. We thought we were all going to be going to Japan after that and I just wanted to see Japan.

42
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And the recruiter said, well, if you sign with the Air Force today, I promise you, I think we can send you to Japan.

43
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We've all kind of heard these stories. There's a point where I promise that I think we can send you to Japan.

44
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Absolutely. He never went back to work for Chrysler two weeks later. He was sitting in Yokohama Harbor in the United States Air Force.

45
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And then he was in there all the way through the first slot in 1964 as basically a 50 year old advisor in the Vietnam. He came home and he said, I've got five kids.

46
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I'm over the age of 50 and I got these other responsibilities and this might be a younger person's war. Then came in.

47
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
How much debriefs, how much, how much, how much did you talk to you about D-Day?

48
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Nothing. Not at all. My father passed when he was 13 when I was 13. Unfortunately.

49
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So it was right about the time when probably your life is getting really questionable about where you want to formulate your life.

50
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Going through high school and probably that time when you got an injured dad there that was on that. And he passed away. That was 13. My mom raised me.

51
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000
In the house, I have two older brothers, two older sisters, both of those sisters, a past away already that were there.

52
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And between us boys, there was nine years apart. Between a spread. So dad was pretty busy over a long period after he came home from a survivor, the Normandy invasion.

53
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And that's exactly where he kind of. When I was 13, he said, look, I'm going to give you one thing.

54
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
He said, I'm responsible to you to your 18. It was a nice. And there's no mistake, Jack, my dad loved all of us.

55
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So this wasn't this tough love or a reeling. He said, look, I'm responsible to you to your 18.

56
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And he said, then you're going to be responsible to make a life for yourself after that.

57
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And you have some choices they're going to present it. He never pushed the military. He never diswated me from the military to do that.

58
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Maybe those questions were to came when I was 14, 15 and 16. That was our other.

59
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I really wish he would have been around when I was, you know, a 22 year old sergeant after Desert Stormer sitting on sea walls and Ocanawa, one learned how to lead troops and how to do different things.

60
00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And you're sitting here with your father that retired as a master sergeant, two three wars and came out and survived the Normandy invasion.

61
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I think the guy probably knew a little bit about survival and leadership and able to do that.

62
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And you kind of just looked around and said, you know, now mom's not here. Dad's not here. He was right.

63
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
He said, you're responsible to make your choices. You're responsible men.

64
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And he felt it was his job up until that time period to make sure that when he spent me out when I was 18, that I could handle what it was at the world was going to throw in me at 18.

65
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
At what point? So you played baseball in high school.

66
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You're you your dad dies when you're 13. So you're going through the high school years with no dad or are you playing sports?

67
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Good student, paying attention in school, rebellious. What was your, what was your childhood?

68
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I'm playing sports. I'm an absolute abysmal student that was all near my wife lapsed up me all the time because in the basement of the house is two to three thousand books.

69
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And I can't ever remember reading really a book the entire time until I went into the US Marine Corps.

70
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I only read books because a teacher said it was on the curriculum, but I had also found that the difference was I understood the difference between teachers.

71
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And I also understood the difference between reward and punishment.

72
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And reward and punishment was if you don't make the grade for here, you will not be able to play the sport that you love over here.

73
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
If you don't want, if you want to wear your hair like you're whatever.

74
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Now, you're going to cut this, you're going to be a gentleman. You're going to get a nice close for these events or not because if you want something you have to do this in order to get that,

75
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
just going to let you sloth your life. And I really did a playing baseball.

76
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So my teachers would start hanging that over my head. And they would say, you know, if you don't make the grade on this next test or whatever,

77
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm going to have to go tell the coach and the coach is going to.

78
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And I really look back and I love the moral and ethical upbringing in that high school that basically, I can't answer if that was the way for everybody,

79
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I got to go. But it was for me and it was getting snatched up by somebody to say you better start to own a line or else I'm not going to put you on that field.

80
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And if I don't put you on that field, this is what it's going to cost us.

81
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And that was the reward and the punishment the reward was you can continue to do what you love.

82
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the punishment was not that we're going to take away something from you personally of what you love.

83
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And I'll show you how much your absence is going to hurt us that is over here. And that was displayed to me in that small little town before I ever set foot on the elephant prints in the Marine Corps.

84
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And I believe set a phenomenal foundation from Military Service.

85
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Did you, did you have any chance of playing like college baseball?

86
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Absolutely not.

87
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I would tell you, jack off like five foot six and like a hundred pounds it was on here. I remember having us outcome by one time because we're in BFE and Northwest Ohio.

88
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You know, those were city kids. Those were people got got scouts in Cleveland. Those were people in Cincinnati, Dayton, child.

89
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You know, these larger division schools.

90
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:17.000
If we had a really good kid that was playing in that area in the whole county, that kid was probably going to be good enough to get a scholarship to a lower level school to play somewhere.

91
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But we didn't come from a long line of people that were playing with the Domejios and everybody else.

92
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And I can stick with you remember one time the guy say and hey, that leaky kid, playing it like a second baseman, that kid's got a million dollar glove, but he's got a 25 dollar bat.

93
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And when you, when you size up your options, if that's saying, this is what's going to take to continue to invest in this in order to do this.

94
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And I had a property coaching. I wouldn't say that we really took individuals and kind of took them over there to groom them for that.

95
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Basically, what that high school did was kind of groom you to at least get out in the world and be a success.

96
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
It wasn't production facility to spit out professional athletes.

97
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So did you start looking at college or did you know that you wanted to go in the military?

98
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I knew I wanted to go in the military.

99
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Maybe it was because no one of my brothers and sisters went.

100
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000
My dad didn't talk about it. I kind of looked up to my dad as being just what a man is.

101
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
I mean, he provides for his family. He works hard every day. He doesn't just lay around in the rack each morning.

102
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
He gets up even in retirement. He disappears. And then he comes home with the dinner bill.

103
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Five o'clock and we talk about what happened in life and that repeatedly was there.

104
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I don't remember arguments with the parents in the house. I don't remember anything.

105
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I do remember each Sunday. He would disappear for about two hours.

106
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And I found out later, my dad would go to the VFW every Sunday for two hours.

107
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And now having been through a lot of the things that I have been through.

108
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
When you're talking about psychoanalyzing, you're talking about therapy,

109
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
you're talking about medications, you're talking about PTSD, you're talking about things like this.

110
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
You're talking about a generation of guys where every single Abouage mail went to war.

111
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:27.000
They either had to tread water for four days when the USS Indianapolis can sank to stay away to save their brothers.

112
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And we're at the anniversary of that right now.

113
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
They were either guys that assaulted the beaches that he would jaman watch their entire high school class as wiped out in a single invasion wave.

114
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
To do that. But somehow these were also the men who came home and built America to what it is today.

115
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.000
And the VA wasn't what it was. I can't remember 17 or 18 bottles of pills lined up.

116
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Ever at the house. I can't remember seeing the man ever take a single thing.

117
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But I think I know why I went to the VFW for two hours on a Sunday.

118
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Because when he walked through that door, he was with people who lived the life that he had lived,

119
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
that no amount of explanation to anybody who didn't live that life was going to ever understand.

120
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
No amount of therapy talking to somebody.

121
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I think the therapy truly was. He sat next to a tank crumon.

122
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
He sat next to a marine. He sat next to a sailor.

123
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
These were also farmers, business owners and everybody else that was there.

124
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Making a life for me to play ball, making a good living for that.

125
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And I think they sat there. They had some drinks. They talked about good times.

126
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
They talked about bad times. They looked each other in the eye every week and then said,

127
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I hope to see you next week.

128
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And then they walked down that door back to their families and did the same work ethic until they died.

129
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
That went out of there.

130
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
And it was truly an amazing work ethic that I got to watch, at least for 13 years,

131
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
of this habit in routine of a man that still 50 plus years old.

132
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Sitting in a rocking chair, but he burst out of a rocking chair every now and then.

133
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And be like, how many pushups can you do?

134
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And like, where did that come from, Dad?

135
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
He's like, well, let's knock him out.

136
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And I barely had ever seen him lift weights do anything else.

137
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
All of a sudden, this guy in a white T shirt and some jeans.

138
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
It still stinks of the back shed.

139
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Something kicked off in his head.

140
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And he said, sorry, down there. And he said, you know what?

141
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You've been sitting down there for about two hours in front of that TV with your hands on your face and everything else

142
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
because there's only one TV in the house.

143
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm the closest to the TV because I have to turn the channel.

144
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
It's only got 11 of them up there.

145
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
You were the remote control.

146
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I was the remote control.

147
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And whatever he would see or that, it was amazing because he would just drop down.

148
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And he'd say, you know what?

149
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
While you're down there or anything else, let me show you some other things you could probably be doing rather just later.

150
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And it wasn't any of these epiphanies of telling me to read Gulliver's travels or any of this other stuff.

151
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
It was just these little snippets along there that really for a third and one year career served me well at the times that I didn't understand them.

152
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
They were made aware to me at the times that I needed them.

153
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah, I think when I look back in my life and I see some little lesson and I do a lot of parsing the lessons that I learned.

154
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And at the time it was like, I barely, I wouldn't have been able to tell you an hour after I learned some lesson that I just learned a really important lesson.

155
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But when I look back 25 years or 30 years or 35 years and I go, oh yeah, I remember when that happened and that left a mark.

156
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And I didn't realize it at the time, but I used that and applied it again and over and over again for the rest of my life.

157
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
At what point did you hear about the United States Marine Corps?

158
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I just 17, I want to go on the military, need a parent signature, my mom is there.

159
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I have now grown up to be probably one of the most loyal, airmen who could have ever served in the Air Force because that's what I wanted to do.

160
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So I signed up for the US Air Force and I took a ride down to Columbus, Ohio about two hours away.

161
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Some of the first times I've ever been to a big city like that and especially on your own.

162
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And I went in and did the swearing in with the Air Force and they pulled me back out and then they brought us back in because there was like two swearing in and we went through the medical check at the maps and everything else.

163
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And I'm like, I'm on my way.

164
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And room opens up, Jago, a major, I'll never forget it because I can still see on that Air Force uniform, I can still see the gold oak leaves, even before I knew what a major was.

165
00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:06.000
He asked for everybody's attention and he said, is there a Lou Hey, Lee Hall loop and I was like, this is the biggest, this is the shortest name that gets f-t up the boats of like anything, right?

166
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And I said, I figure he's talking about me pick my end up, he said, I need to talk to you outside and he took me into a room that was smaller than this.

167
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And it was kind of like, I don't know what's about to happen in this room, but it's just me and him.

168
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I can still see a swap bucket sticking in the corner, this was not a professional office.

169
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And he just said, I'm really sorry I pulled you out of there, he goes, we made some mistake on your paperwork.

170
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And I said, well, what does that? And he goes, we put the different number on your medical paperwork and we should have put another number.

171
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And he said, something about ones and twos, and I said, I don't understand what does that mean he goes, well, it means that we tested you and put it that you were caught that you had a color vision.

172
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And he goes, unfortunately, you're colorblind.

173
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
And I said, what does that mean? Nobody's ever told me that.

174
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
And he goes, well, what that means, for the Air Force is of the 400 and two jobs that were available to you in the United States Air Force.

175
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
There's now one way or two available. And it's not the one that you wanted to do. And I said, what are those jobs? Can I ask? I really still want to be an Air Force.

176
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And I'll never forget this. I was going to be what was known as an aircraft armament system specialist because I figured that Air Force don't have infantry.

177
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So let me load the planes, let me do whatever we have to do to crew these planes to get them in there.

178
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
And he came back and he said, first one is Air Frame Specialist.

179
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I said, what is that? And he goes, well, basically, they give you a rubber mallet. And anytime the aircraft comes back, and it's got dancing.

180
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And you just kind of go out there and beat the dancer out of the aircraft. He didn't sell the job.

181
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because these guys make bank on the outside. He probably could have sold me on a career with a rubber mallet that said, you're going to make a lot of money on the outside.

182
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Didn't sell it. And then the second one was, I will never forget. He said, pharmacist.

183
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And I was looking, and I said, aren't those pills all different colors? I might kill somebody to do that.

184
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And he said, then I'm sorry we can't unless you're near for me.

185
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
My mother was the biggest fanatic of the Air Force ever was. That was here.

186
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm sitting in Columbus, go to the wild. I can't tell my mom.

187
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I mean, this comes back to you're talking about moral and ethical courage and everything else.

188
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Man and all this and you're sitting here like, hey, tell me my mom, this is just a happen.

189
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
So I wandered around Columbus Ohio at night in the city I've never known.

190
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
I disappeared from the maps. They kind of put an APB out on a missing potential recruit that was out there.

191
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And then my mom calls and the Air Force is kind of like, well, we can't find him.

192
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
For sorry, we lost you.

193
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.000
And she said, you better get it's down there and start looking. And I kind of went out and started actually not getting you talking to bumps on benches that night kind of like proud you get airman.

194
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Did you try to get in the Air Force too? And he told you, no.

195
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And it was so dangerous.

196
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It's just this farm kid wandering around.

197
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And you know, I could have killed in any moment.

198
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Finally I walk back over the maps.

199
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I go all hell breaks loose. They get me back in and they tell me, sit your sit your butt right there and go go anywhere.

200
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
And I'm kind of in this row of chairs with nothing.

201
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And I'm sitting there feeling sorry for myself.

202
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I'm thinking my life so I don't know. You asked me before about where you thinking about college.

203
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Did you do this?

204
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I didn't even take the SATs and the ACTs because I'm kind of a person that I'm going to put my time towards the things that you can do.

205
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I'm not going to waste my time on something that I don't believe that I'm driving towards the path to do.

206
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And the teachers, because I wasn't a good student, really wasn't pushing me to go take those SATs and ACTs.

207
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I think they were pushing me to start bailing hay on the outside of town for the next 25 years.

208
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Something to do that.

209
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And as I was sitting there feeling sorry for myself, one of the last times I've ever done that in my life,

210
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
the I saw a person standing in front of me with blue trousers and a red stripe running down.

211
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And he said exactly this. He goes, what the hell is your problem?

212
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
And I remember saying some bullshit came out of my mouth about something.

213
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
And he goes, I don't know where you come from, but that's not how you talk to a person.

214
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
You'll get on your feet, son, when you talk to me.

215
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I'd never know where you talked to me like that years. I wasn't around long enough from my dad to tell me to do that.

216
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
So I stood up, Jago.

217
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
And then I was staring straight at his name, saying, can't we start and speak hard?

218
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I didn't even know what a gun he was at that time and he looked at me and he goes, you look like somebody just killed your favorite dog.

219
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
What happened?

220
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
And I told him.

221
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And he said, look, I'm, you're attached to the air force.

222
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I'm not even supposed to be talking to you right now or that.

223
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
But do you mind if I give your number to the Marine Retriever that was up near the house?

224
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
He saw an avenue of a approach. Absolutely.

225
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I got back up home. Monday shows up.

226
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
My mom answers the door.

227
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
There's a snappy Marine standing there, a big smile on his face.

228
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Staffs are in Craig Cochran.

229
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Good morning, man.

230
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Can I talk to you about being in your son about the Marine Corps?

231
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
My mom said you're too late.

232
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
My son already joined the air force because I'm still a cow.

233
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I can't tell her.

234
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
And Jack, I'm sitting right now.

235
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I was watching this app.

236
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Boom, my mom just goes back to the work.

237
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Doing that.

238
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Same time.

239
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tuesday.

240
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Persistence pays off.

241
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Tuesday, he came back to the same house.

242
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Man, can I talk to you?

243
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Uh, my great opportunity for your son or everything else on the Marine Corps.

244
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And she goes, I already told you.

245
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
He joined the air force.

246
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Good bye.

247
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Wednesday.

248
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Same time.

249
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Now mom's probably kind of figuring out something's up.

250
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Open the door.

251
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I go and I never heard my mom cuss anything else like that.

252
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And this little five foot four lady said,

253
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
That's the damn problem with you, charheads.

254
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
You don't listen.

255
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
I already told you.

256
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I just slammed the door.

257
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Thursday was a day change in my life.

258
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
He didn't walk away from the door.

259
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
And my mom turned to be and said, what the hell did you do?

260
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And I said, you better let him in the house.

261
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Saturday table just like this.

262
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Three and a half hours.

263
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I'm 17.

264
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Jack, I still need the lady signature.

265
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
We get there.

266
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And we didn't have to do benefit tags.

267
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
We didn't have to do anything.

268
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
This is an avenue.

269
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I want to be in the military.

270
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
This door shut.

271
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
This door is now opened.

272
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
This is what I'm going to do.

273
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
And my mom had said, do you know how the Marines live?

274
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Her brothers were Marines and were a war too.

275
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Everybody, all their brothers were in the war.

276
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
And she said, in the air force, she showed me this really cushy life.

277
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
You can have the greatest base housing.

278
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
The best BX is to pass everything else.

279
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
You know, I want for my little boy.

280
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
And I want to none of that.

281
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And that's not what I wanted in the military.

282
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I want to dodge ships.

283
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I wanted, I wanted the grooming.

284
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
I wanted whatever the military gave my father.

285
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Because I looked at that as the key to this was a huge part of a life that I never knew about him.

286
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So I'm going to go and seek out that answer on what that gave.

287
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Came in, signed it.

288
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
She's got tears in her eyes.

289
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
She says this really what you want.

290
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
I said, yes, what I want.

291
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
She signed it.

292
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
And he said, when he graduated, he's all yours.

293
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And she looked right in me.

294
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
And she goes, you're going to get everything you harassed for more.

295
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And she goes, all I can say for you is you're very hard enough.

296
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Yep.

297
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
After that, my mom became like before there was UFC and everything else.

298
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
My mom turned into a different person magically in front of me.

299
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
This woman who cooked for all of us and made the beds and did all this other stuff in a very feminine nature.

300
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Now, took on the role of a father that I didn't have.

301
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
And she now started exposing me to the stories that she was with growing up with your father.

302
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Going through Vietnam, going through Korea, going through this.

303
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
You're going to be an NCO.

304
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Watching my mother tell me how to be an NCO.

305
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
This is what's going to be required of you in the first year, second year, the third year.

306
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And then the day she put me there.

307
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
She says, it's going to be hard.

308
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
But if you quit, don't you ever come back to this house.

309
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
She just don't quit.

310
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
That was it.

311
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Put me on the bus, sent me down.

312
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
A few weeks later, I think was 11 at the time, Jago.

313
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:07.000
She became the best flag waving, US Marine Corps mom that you ever looked as they all do when they see their baby in the uniform and to that.

314
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And she would hold the rallies for the entire town to help the desert storm troops and pack all the balls.

315
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And you just kind of saw this part of your mom that you never saw growing up that opened that up to the leader she really was to.

316
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
And then you found out in life.

317
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
You thought you were putting all your chips in this one leadership basket when in all reality.

318
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000
You were putting your chips in an unbalanced bet because the real person who was really balancing that out.

319
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It was a team effort.

320
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And that town, my family, everybody else taught me before I knew what that was that in life you have to learn to work.

321
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Is a team you have to learn to be a good teammate to somebody.

322
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And it doesn't matter if that's in the military.

323
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
It doesn't matter if that's been when that day on the outside of town is.

324
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
People want to work for people that they want to show up every day and it's a pleasure to be around.

325
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And then when I have a productive person and they want to have a good teammate.

326
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
That was the foundation and that's how I ended up in the Marines.

327
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
It's kind of that everybody.

328
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:30.000
There's millions of people in uniform, but it's a weird, every American story is not this clear line that goes straight to the recruiter to battle to the metal of honor to something like this.

329
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
It takes this really weird nexus.

330
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And I think that's really the greatness of America.

331
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
That's what makes us the strongest fighting force in the world.

332
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
That nexus.

333
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
How much of a shock to your system was boot camp?

334
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
First week like anybody else, you really evaluate in a decision that you just made.

335
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And you're sitting here and it's kind of laughing.

336
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Today it's not a laughable woman to be in a COVID environment or anything else.

337
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
You would kind of wish that a drone instructor had a mask on or something when they're getting in your face and you're doing whatever.

338
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:21.000
But the best thing was it was the routine that I saw my dad and it was also the expectation was laid up front by the drone structures that came out and gave you through that drone instructor,

339
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:32.000
if you do this, this is what you will get. And if you want to do that, we demand this from you to be part of this team.

340
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I could sit on the corridor deck at first day. I knew I was in the right place.

341
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
And I knew that in a really weird way everything happens for a reason.

342
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
You are where you're supposed to be in life at certain points in your life that may not make sense to you at all,

343
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:55.000
but it's not up to you to make sense. If you believe in the bigger collective and higher power that moves the chess pieces or the chess pieces,

344
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
I think there's somebody else that looks at everybody's life and somebody on the outside is looking seven moves,

345
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
where you can't look on where you eventually at the 20 years, the 30 years, the 40 years, the influential 50 year mark.

346
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
If we put you through these trials, here's what we're going to demand back for that.

347
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And I could feel that day one. I felt this is professional. I'm in the right place.

348
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And every single day you got better is something. And every single day you were told that you were the worst at being something.

349
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And you need to get better tomorrow at doing this.

350
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And they didn't do it in a touchy, feeling away, which then I found out, you know, in life right up front, you don't have to,

351
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000
you don't have to love people to get them to do this. You know, don't be in love with them. You can love those troops. You can do that,

352
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000
but this harsh training and the systematic approach that is produced a product for the American people that spits out this professional fighting man and woman on the other hand,

353
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
just get on the conveyor belt. And if you stay on the conveyor belt, work, it's like Steve Austin.

354
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:16.000
We're going to make it bigger, faster, stronger, you're 114 pounds. You get eat three plates a child today. And as a matter of fact, see Jocco's child over there, you get his child too,

355
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
or you get his child because they will pack 60 pounds on you by peanut butter and jelly and bread or whatever.

356
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000
At the same time, they'll shave 80 pounds off of that guy in 11 to 13 weeks to where they get this product that is malable.

357
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Once it gets to the field, and their job wasn't to make a combat ready, marine. It was to make a united states marine.

358
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Then they put John that conveyor belt to the next generation. And those guys are the warriors at either the school of infantry,

359
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000
or on the Amphib Cruman School, or whatever they're going to do to train you to be your specific job.

360
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
And then I loved the fact that the wounds would break it out and not try to do all this like,

361
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
let's not teach everybody everything in a need hour class today. Let's focus on this razor sharp thing.

362
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And then we're going to practice that this week. Then once you've somewhat got to a level,

363
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
nowhere near the level of mastery that we believe you can shoulder something else,

364
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
let's now add this to the plate the next week.

365
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And then before you know that, you got three stripes up cross rifles, and they give you a squatimer range and say,

366
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
now what we just did to you, we want you, this is the payback. We gave you this, we now demand this from you.

367
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
You now take that and make them into the little Steve Austin. It's very, very beautiful.

368
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Did you know what your job was going to be when you went, when you enlisted?

369
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:48.000
I knew I had an opportunity to be in four jobs, and it was tanks. It was Amtracks.

370
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
It was Field Artillery, or it was a combat engineer, it was called a combat BC option at four jobs into that.

371
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
And then by about the 17th day of boot camp, you take this other classification test,

372
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
and then they kind of take those skill sets.

373
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
And then they according to whatever is there, and I just happened to be a really great swimmer.

374
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
It was in the pool, and I didn't know that that was going to get me anything else.

375
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
But when the decisions all laid out, they said, look, when you, it sounds like a fish in the swim tank.

376
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
We're going to put in my amphibious tanks that are over there.

377
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
And it was just like full metal jacket to tell you, land the batoon is still there.

378
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Nowadays, a majority of them all know what they're going to do.

379
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.000
It was still on the quarter deck with the proverbial gunnery, starting a heartman having you stand up and say,

380
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Sir, yes, sir, I'm going to tell you, and this is going to be your job.

381
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And he said, amphibious tractor crew and something like that, he said, Amtracks.

382
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Oh, and there.

383
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.000
I said, I said, I said, I said, I sat down and went to an ex-kids inventory, whatever I'm sitting here like I got screwed.

384
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
You're going to the grunts, it's what I'm going to do.

385
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I said, I'm going to be at some depot, load and trains man for the next four years,

386
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
because I thought that's what an amtrak was.

387
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
It was a train.

388
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I never knew that it was an amphibious tank.

389
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I didn't even think that was an option.

390
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And then when the drum instructors showed me the photograph and everything else like that, you are, well, you're supposed to be.

391
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
So then you go to what amphibious track school was right here at Camp Delmore, California.

392
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Yep, absolutely.

393
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And unfortunately, you know, a shot out to all of our brothers and net that are going through some hard times today,

394
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
because one of those same amphibian tractors were lost last night in the training evolution.

395
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And so, somewhere out here off the Pacific coast, and right now we still have at last record about six marines that are still missing.

396
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:57.000
They're in that, and that's the danger of the business of the everyday business of doing that kind of work.

397
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And prayers go out to their families.

398
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I remember what everyone of those is like.

399
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I mean, tonight the absence of a news void or anything else for the past 24 hours,

400
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
when you don't know if your kid was one of the ones, but you do know they're in that unit.

401
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
And the unit's blocked out in the rent river city, and nobody can say anything,

402
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
and you just want to hear confirmation of this.

403
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
And then these people on Forteway are going to sit right in front of the news media.

404
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And they're going to start feeding off of whatever bits and pieces that they can do.

405
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:40.000
But tragic, but as you and I discussed before, Jaco, it's the cost of doing business to maintain a ready state in the United States military.

406
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And that was the job that I was given.

407
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Yesterday, I got to go up here to camp, I was back in the area to actually go and reopen a museum that I had a hand in creating in 1996.

408
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
That was called the Landing Vehicle Tract Museum for World War II in Korea.

409
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
So it's the predecessors of those guys out there on the 15th view right now.

410
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And we opened a beautiful museum that had LBT ones and twos that were at Tarawa and Sipan,

411
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
and all the way through Korea with LBT3C and being a young sergeant,

412
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
I was one of the one that was people that drove those last generation working vehicles into that quans at heart,

413
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
where they still sit today and parked them.

414
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And yesterday was an absolutely adjuice occasion for that same community that hours later.

415
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
I was now sitting here on that debit tragedy.

416
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I've been doing that so the wave of emotions going back from one side to another,

417
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
and I've been having this to sadness, back to happiness. It was like that every day that you climbed in those vehicles.

418
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Yeah, one of the things about working in the water and this is something I used to tell guys,

419
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
is every time you do work in the water, it's a real-world mission because you make a mistake out there.

420
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
The ocean has no mercy and it's a dangerous, dangerous environment.

421
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.000
And I was always, you know, you talk about UN and up in kind of the perfect place. I always felt like that.

422
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Every damn day I felt like I was in the perfect job.

423
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And one of the things that would make me think that was, you know, we, I did two arguments out here on the West Coast.

424
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
We worked hand in hand with the Marines all the time, but, you know, we'd be launching our Zodiacs or our ribs off the side of the boat.

425
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And, you know, they would be launching A-A-Vs. And, you know, look, you look at it.

426
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
It's kind of like looking at a bumblebee fly, right? You look at that thing you go, that thing's not going to fly.

427
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
That's right. How is that going to work? And then you see it and you go, wow, that's awesome.

428
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
But, you know, how tall is an A-A-V? 10 feet tall, 14 feet, 14 feet tall.

429
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And then you see him in the water and there's a few feet sticking out, but the rest of it is underneath.

430
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And, you know, you just can't help but think that every time you look at him, you know, you think, wow, man, I hope that's going to go.

431
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000
All right, especially when there would be rough seas. And those things, which, so every time you do water work, it's a real world up.

432
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
And, and what was crazy about yesterday, you know, it's summer time here in Southern California. It's beautiful.

433
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000
The beaches are beautiful. And, and I woke up this morning saw the news and I just thought to myself, you know, it's a second feeling that you get.

434
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Because we're all here and it's like I said, it's a sunny beautiful day in Southern California.

435
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
It's, you know, going to be a horrible day for the Marine Corps.

436
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.000
But like you said, that's what everyone in that job does to maintain readiness.

437
00:42:45.000 --> 00:43:01.000
There's a risk to maintain readiness. And, of course, the risk to maintain readiness is miniscule, compared to the risk to not maintain readiness and not be ready to defend the country.

438
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
What year was this? So, you, did you enlist in 1988?

439
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:21.000
So, 88, 89, I was over there at Track School. And then, and then at what point? So, now we start brewing up for, for desert storm. Where were you when we started brewing? Where were you when, when Saddam invaded Kuwait?

440
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
I was actually in South America. I was at Camp, as you know, Carolina. And I was down there doing some, some unitas deployment.

441
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
It was in South America. So, August 2nd kicks off. And, and we're somewhere on the other side of the streets on the Jellon.

442
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Going around, thing, and one of the first naval ships to be poured back in Argentina.

443
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
So, you know, excitement is happening. Everybody wants to do that. And then you kind of get the battle order.

444
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
And then you realize you're not part of the battle order.

445
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Everybody else is starting to go towards South West Asia. You're still going to finish what you're doing because that's the mission that you're required to do.

446
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Right. And, and that was another great learning lesson at that age of, you are a warrior supposed to be.

447
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
At that is, your drive discipline desire motivation was everything. You want to be there. That's why you did this.

448
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:31.000
That's why you did that. But as you just said about maintaining a balanced force and a state of readiness, you can't rob from one theater to do to another theater on an impulse that has not presented itself to do that.

449
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And, of course, when you're down in the Well Deck or you're in the birthing areas down below and you're only any three or any four.

450
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
The news is what people tell you the news is that day.

451
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And the news for you is get your weapon and get on post for the next six hours and do your job. And then let people start talking up here about what's going to happen and you'd watch that formulate.

452
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:02.000
The best thing was roughly we pulled back in in just prior to Christmas that year.

453
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And when I got back to New York, Carolina, this ramp we called this field of amphibian vehicles.

454
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000
That are usually about 250 of them sitting out there was none sitting there because they're already on ships and to the war.

455
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So now the depression creeps in the year the rear party. Congratulations.

456
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And we came in. We parked them, dinner after ops, the battalion commander at the time met us when we came in off of the ship.

457
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:46.000
And he had brought us into the hanger, dropped all of our gear and he said, here's what's going on.

458
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
And that's what I really respected. He gave you the time to mission the place he gave you exactly.

459
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Don't worry about what you're hearing in the news. Listen to me. And I'm going to, this is real.

460
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
And he said, I want you guys to go home. Maybe you just came off the six month deployment.

461
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I want you guys to take Christmas. And he said this.

462
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
On January 3rd, I'm going to be standing back in this hanger if you want to go to combat you be here.

463
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000
It almost sounds like something out of Kelly's heroes. When you think about it like, okay, do I have to tell anybody or clear this?

464
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
What no one is kind of like go, go home. Get your plant eggs get out of here.

465
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
And the best thing was after that was also the worst thing.

466
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000
When you actually looked at the left and right every day and you had that trust factor, that's well-oiled unit and you live with these people and you do that.

467
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
It's a lot of times when you're driving towards the mission that you don't believe is going to result in combat.

468
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000
The cohesion of that unit is missing something a little bit more than when you know that you're going to go in and be responsible to possibly be the person to bring somebody's father or somebody home to do that.

469
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
And it wasn't presented that way to me when I was a PSU or Lance Corp.

470
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
It was kind of just going to go on this float and you'll get a ribbon and people come back.

471
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
You go out and the next year it'll come in.

472
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Desert Storm made a real. It was on that.

473
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.000
But what it also made a real was there was only seven of us showed back up in an aircraft hanger on January 3rd.

474
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
My platoon sergeant was one of them.

475
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And a guy that I respected and retired as a sergeant major, it was out of there. A couple of NCOs, a couple of us troops that were inside of there.

476
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
And that was it.

477
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:42.000
And they put us on a truck and the rest of them we went back up to the barracks and they said, yeah, four hours to pack your stuff and you use your gear, you're missing.

478
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
You'll take it down to there and you just kind of saw a different thing.

479
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Or people's EOS up and you do you do you at you have I mean you're how many people are in your battalion you have orders EOS as you have everything going on at that time.

480
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000
But you also have the difference of somebody being presented with the thing of you're going to war.

481
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
You're not going to the vacation that's over here now.

482
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
You're going to war and that is what I've always told people.

483
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
That's the first punch in your face in life.

484
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And you have to do something.

485
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
And you're going to go left. You're going to go right.

486
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
A lot of people don't want to continue to get punched in the face so they learn the skills to prevent that from happening.

487
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Some people have to continue to repeatedly get punched in the face when they do this.

488
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
But some people react differently after that happens.

489
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
And I still say, no, I don't know if that makes you a bad person or whatever because I don't know what's going on in your life.

490
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
But there was a lot more of a stand in here a couple of weeks ago when it happened.

491
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And now there's a lot less of us there standing here.

492
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Should I do in that and true to his work?

493
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:05.000
We packed up, got on the thing, we were on a plane and we were some of the last people to land right before Desert Storm kicked off at the end of January.

494
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
So did you deploy as what kind of you come back with?

495
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
You come back with placement.

496
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
I deployed as a combat replay.

497
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
You're not even basically right now deploying knowing what you're going to do your job.

498
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
You're going to be a combat replacement because you don't know if the war at the time you get there.

499
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
So are you going to be kicking off?

500
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
So were they taking volunteers to become that replacements?

501
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Is that what that was?

502
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
You didn't have a choice.

503
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
If you volunteered and you were sent to South Las Vegas, you are needs of the Marine Corps once you got on deck.

504
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:43.000
It just worked out for me very well that there was still a shortage of people in my job career field to do that.

505
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
So I got put in an attempt, briefed.

506
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000
We all got separated and then we got sent to South Las Vegas to report to these units.

507
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.000
And this is just a couple of weeks before the invasion is going to kick off.

508
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
The unit that I got put into Jaco was I was one of only two active duty Marines,

509
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
dropped into an all reserve unit.

510
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Wow.

511
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
And that was an eye opener.

512
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
They're wearing the same uniforms.

513
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Sometimes they believe in a different thing.

514
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And it's not again, it's not bad.

515
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
It's just the way it was.

516
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
And the reality was two weeks,

517
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Lash this whole thing up, stay in the desert, train whatever you have to do.

518
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
And then you're going to be in charge of blowing these breach lanes that are going to be

519
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000
going to be going in for the assault forces to go up into the Coady invasion.

520
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
And I can remember being taken into a tent, kind of for a brief.

521
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And it really wasn't a brief.

522
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
The chaplain kind of came in and you know the prayers start happening.

523
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000
This is a night basically before you're going to go across a briefslames.

524
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
And they sent it that time.

525
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
They said everybody it's standing in this tent.

526
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
We're not going to bullshit you.

527
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
We're expecting 82% casualties tomorrow when we went through that.

528
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And I don't know if there was a fear in what they had said.

529
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Or there was a fear in you guys have already done the big blue arrows and red arrows and wargaming or whatever to come up with that thing.

530
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
That's not just an arbitrary number that you all came up with.

531
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
And I'm, you know, to shut the ragman stand in here, go in, get in the middle of the desert.

532
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
And then that was it.

533
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
You got sent out to your unit.

534
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Best of luck.

535
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
I hope to see you on the other side of the breach and bone.

536
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
And then the hundred hour war goes.

537
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Just so everyone knows normally we try to do a little bit better when we're planning missions to think that we're going to have an 82% casualties rate.

538
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
And I was going to say that earlier, you know, so I got in the Navy in 1990.

539
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:04.000
And so as all the stuff was brewing up the thing that will always stick in my mind. And until I was, you know, going through boot camp and whatnot.

540
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
They were saying there's going to be 40,000 casualties in the first, I think it was for it.

541
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000
I would never watch and see it. And and here's the, you know, whatever whatever talking head was on there, whatever, you know, retired army or retired Marine Corps.

542
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Colonel, I don't remember.

543
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000
And they were going back and forth with these numbers and what they were predicting because of chemical warfare and the resistance that they were going to be.

544
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:47.000
The resistance that they were going to meet, they were expecting 40,000 casualties in the first 24 to 48 hours, which is, I guess, right in line with 82% and I was of course thinking, well, I'm going to get, you know, in my freaking whatever 18 year old idiot mind, I'm thinking, okay, maybe I won't miss this because they're going to need.

545
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.000
I don't think I knew the term replacement, but I was like they're going to need more guys. They're going to need me. They're going to need me and I'm ready to rock and roll.

546
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Because that's what you think like when you're, when you're young and stupid.

547
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And then not so, so then what did it look like? What happened on the push?

548
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Well, when you kind of quantify that in your head that was there at large open expanses of just wide open desert that is on there.

549
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:30.000
The number was more of a reality to me because I kind of knew the history of what my career field had since it was enveloped in 1942 and when it was delivering the infantry onto the objective, there was no ship to shore movement here.

550
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:46.000
So you're just in the objective from A to B and the objectives are supposed to be crossing the flaming tank ditches that Saddam Hussein had rolled all these things in because I believe at the time they were talking, this is the fourth largest army in the world.

551
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Battle hardened army that just fought for 10 years with Iran.

552
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:05.000
So it was absolutely, absolutely. It was there. And then you're kind of sitting here and going, okay, you get through the breach lanes, you sit there and I will remember one of the most powerful things outside of 2003.

553
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I'm seeing a US strike force across the deserts in New Iraq. One of the most powerful things I've ever seen in my life was sitting on the opposite side of the breach lanes with hatches.

554
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:23.000
What we call combat lock. So it only gives you enough to see out of it, but enough to save you from fragmentation or anything else that's coming in.

555
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And have a night vision that is of quality of 1991. So it looks like a big fish ball and everything in the driver seat.

556
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:47.000
But hearing the waves of B-52s come over to pound the target, made my heart pump more than anything in my life. To that point, because you heard the rumble before. And this was what you had heard.

557
00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:03.000
In World War II, they sent 1,000 plane raids into Germany with B-17s B-24s. Things that I've been blessed to go out and find these crews. Now that it went on IPs and didn't come home for all those years.

558
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:21.000
These B-52s went tip to wing tip. And then you see what an arc light rate can do. And then you just hear the bombs hit. And the whole sky turns to fire. And that's where you're going.

559
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And if it's kind of like, you know what? That's where I want to go. And that's where everybody is loaded up here and wants to go. And that was always the greatness of, you know, whether it's the seal teams, whether it's the tank team, whether it's the infantry rifle squad or anything else.

560
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:57.000
And the woman that I grew up and tried to left and right on were the people who always wanted to run to the sound of the guns. And there's something different about this people. And it doesn't make them different in a weird way. It makes them very different in the fact that you really are.

561
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:08.000
You're really proud that you knew people like that in your life. You're really proud that those were the people who were there at that time period. That said, you know, put the right hand in the air and said send me, I'll go.

562
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
And then you looked five or six guys down going, I never thought you'd even be here.

563
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Like I can remember like you can't even tie your own shoes or to do something. Then the best thing is when the bullet start flying, you find out that's the weekend kid that's dragging his buddies 100 meters across a thing that was here.

564
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And you see people just step up and being presented as a young man at 21 at that time period to see that much awesomeness to see this is what your country can when it puts its mind to it.

565
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:52.000
This is what your country can do. And even in your head, you're like, no, this is what my country can do when they're still on the leash.

566
00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:01.000
I can only imagine what this country can do when they're not on the leash because you know, we don't train and we don't do with things.

567
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:15.000
You know, in our schools and that it fights a Chinese weba of total war and a gangas con war and a United States still does train its individuals to positive identification of a target.

568
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:24.000
You're just not going to go in to do this to a village without this. Now whether that happens or not, that's part of the individuals that make that choice after they get there.

569
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:33.000
But it isn't the way that they were trained that they went up to that. And I was lucky to be part of the units that were really fluid when they went in there to do that.

570
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:42.000
And within those first 48 hours, we kind of knew what was going to happen because we would be driving as we're driving north.

571
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:49.000
All we just kept seeing is lines of Iraqis on each side of the road. They had already dropped their weapons.

572
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:59.000
There wasn't large fire fights. They had the tank fights out near Kofgee with with Lear 82nd airborne had little action that was going up there.

573
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:10.000
But for the most part, the hundred hour war of the Blitz Creek war was basically overwhelming the enemy on the Horn of a dilemma where they cannot react to what's being thrown at them.

574
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.000
And then they just get so scared. They just throw their stuff. And I think the predominantly they threw their stuff because they were in somebody else's country.

575
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:25.000
And then they were in a big mindset change when you train your troops for the 2003 invasion.

576
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000
And I don't believe a lot of leaders at the time learned from the lessons in 1991.

577
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I believe in the ground war operations. A lot of people that were still around, that were in higher levels to plan those mission things.

578
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:50.000
We thought that they were still going to fight when the Iraqis see this awesome power coming down. They're just going to drop their weapons. They're going to do what they did in 1991.

579
00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:02.000
There is a reason that I'm very proud of the inflicting the most demonic casualties on the enemy and bringing the most demonic people home and doing that.

580
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000
The simple fact is on a 30 day built ride in 2003. Those boys didn't land the rack. They moved ammunition from the front of the ship to the back of the ship.

581
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:18.000
We would move up things and put machine guns off of the af fan tails. We would kick buckets. You would train until people were just exhausted.

582
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:27.000
And when they laid in the racket, 209, 05, you're up, your PT and you're doing is get the box and gloss.

583
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:39.000
You're going to get punched in the face in the well deck before we get over here. And it's not going to be Lance Corporal against Lance Corporal. No. It's going to be plus or minus 10 pounds that we're inside of here. You're going to do this.

584
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:50.000
But also, this is bone the ring. This isn't that white collar leadership thing. The base of we sense the troops out to be each other up by the hangout in the cheese mess. No.

585
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Staffs are going to lieutenant. We're all on the ring, too. And we're all on the ring going your next. Come on in. You got 30 seconds.

586
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Blow the thing. Where it out? Where's the next one coming from? And you would watch people go their amtrakers.

587
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:23.000
They're never seen that. These guys are training like combatants. Like they are expecting close quarter battle. They are expecting this. Because the end result, Jaka, was it's pretty easy to throw your hands up when you've invaded somebody else's country and just say, oops, my bad, I'm out of here man.

588
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Leave me alone. We're going into their backyard. They got nowhere to run.

589
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I don't think they're going to be so apt to throw their weapons down or anything else. Nor would somebody in Nebraska or high or anything else on an abdating thing. So the mindset was different.

590
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Some ways had to be harsher.

591
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So the hundred hour war, I mean, what did how did that wrap up for you wrapped up with rolling up into Kuwait wars over who wants to go home? I don't.

592
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
We're looking for people to stay on a working party afterwards. Why?

593
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Extra combat pay extra everything for a young person. I'm not married. I would just rip off the case of the M.O. recarton because you didn't have to run the letter. Didn't have to have mail. You just sign on anything there. Just say, mom, I'll kind of be home when I get home.

594
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And I stayed in the next six months. It was in there. And I went down to the port of Al Jubeil and back loaded all the American equipment on the black bottom shipping. And then also all the Iraq war trophies that came out, which was BMP, ZSUs, anything else, agricultural inspections when you're younger are away a life.

595
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So you're out there cleaning that stuff to get all that grid off before it goes on that American ship to get back. But the best thing was how you were treated in the autonomy that you got being an NCO was there wasn't anybody there any day telling you what to do.

596
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It was you knew your job. Here's your mission. Each morning you get up. You got to move this equipment from here to here, which was 19, 20 miles down to a thing sometimes. You learned how to drive tanks, LAVs, you learned it because you were cross train to move all this equipment, which gave you a different skill set.

597
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And then at the meantime, they put you over a place called Camp 15. It had this gigantic swimming pool. You got a room to yourself and you're living high on the hog at that. And then every couple of weeks they had contracted a ship down south that was a cruise ship for the American troops to do R&R on for like three days at a pop. And you can drink, covert, you had to check your uniform before you went on the ship.

598
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:54.000
No one was allowed to use ranks, nothing. And there's like 2,000 people on the ship pierside in my reign. That's like here's your three days R&R. Like it's China Beach with no beach, no nothing.

599
01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You got going anywhere, but these were exposed to you. It was kind of like making more money, more autonomy, learning, multitude of skills. I think I like this until somebody knocked on the door one day and said, times up, but you got to go home. And we went back.

600
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And then at the tail end of that, you kind of get put back into this post war thing that I had not seen. And I'd heard stories of it from Vietnam of times up.

601
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There wasn't a transition for these guys. There wasn't hardly anything. It was going to like we brought on well over 250,000 marines at a time when we only had a god 120,000 before that war and then plus the reserves and all this.

602
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And I just watched guys volunteered. Now that they're back there, it's Monday. You're out of the marines on Friday.

603
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The admin center, go to here, go to everything else. And you know as well as I do, you know, a lot of them wanted that just getting me out of here.

604
01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And there were other people that were kind of asking, can I stay and do this to you need a thing. And the answer to that when we usually demobilize from war is no, thank you for your service.

605
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And I needed to transition back out in the civilian society. So we watched our numbers completely get depleted. And then you watched the wear and tear on all those vehicles when they came back home. So you go into this post war rebuilding period.

606
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And you figure Somalia is right around the corner.

607
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Then you knew, I what point did you just realize you were going to be doing 20 or 30 years in the Marine Corps?

608
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:42.000
When I went to the first professional course at the Marine Corps ever sent me to. And when I got back from the war, things in peace time are different.

609
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And you know what I'm going to about in 2007 time frame when we're fighting and I've got to stand, I rack up at any marine base.

610
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
And you can probably attest to this in the teams.

611
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You were coming or going. And you see your buddies passing through bases. And one of you was coming from the other one is going.

612
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And there is no one to two dwell. It's 7 in 5 out 7 in whatever the rotations were at. And that was the rate that was going. It's nowhere near that now.

613
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, it was definitely nowhere near that in 1992, 93, 94. It was now kind of, okay, I've been to South America.

614
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Okay, now I came in to do all of this. Swim and I do. And I'm going to get out.

615
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I've kind of, I want to go be a hard helmet diver. I want to go do some things like that.

616
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And my leadership came to me, you know, I said, you got four months left in the Marines. We don't know what to do with you.

617
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And you talked about that before, but you know, whether it's fleet assistance programs or something that these short-term billets are out there.

618
01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:03.000
This guy came in and he goes, I'm going to send you this professional NCO school. And like it's a waste of time. I'm getting out to tell him when he's like, just go over there for 30 days.

619
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Do me a favor. In other words, he's got to build a team that he's going to have. And he can't trust that he can't rely on you.

620
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Somebody else has to learn your job now, just because you're not going to be here. Okay, so I'm confident you can do your job, but I can't count on you in four months.

621
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Now get out of here and let the corporal now learn how to do your job. And it was pretty cool. And I went over there and I saw something like I'd never seen.

622
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:40.000
What in a bunch of grease monkeys? It wasn't a bunch of hours work in 17 and 18 hours. It wasn't anything. It was in uniforms.

623
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And it was learning all these other professional things. Nobody was really teaching you on the jump seat of amphibious tractor.

624
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Because you just had to work to do the job done. So I got rolled up being the bad student I was.

625
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Okay, I got rolled up within the first week and it's kind of like, bro, come in here. What's your problem?

626
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And I know you've got a short time and everything else, but you're here. So that means you'll give 100% while you're here.

627
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Thank you very much, Gani. Got that. And then he took the time. It's the one I'll never forget. He took the time.

628
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Other people would not take.

629
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
When I told you I was a bad student in high school, I could have been a better student in high school.

630
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And I'm not blaming the teachers. The ownership is me on that. I could have applied myself better. I could have done this.

631
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
But I will tell you there were courses that I applied myself in more because the teacher actually cared.

632
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And they actually didn't just ring the bell and say, we'll see you tomorrow. And if you had problems, it would be like, can I, can I hold you after class and I'll let the next teacher know you're going to be a little late.

633
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Hey, you're having some problems doing this or that and they would take this time. Even if it was just a small period of time.

634
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
It was time they didn't have.

635
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.000
And I learned how to appreciate the biggest thing that you can do to somebody if you disrespect them in life as to take away their time.

636
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Because it's something they can never get back. That's it. And I knew she didn't have the time to do this, but she took the time.

637
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I became a better student in that class. I didn't become a great student, but I did what I had to do to continue to make mission.

638
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000
That was all there. Congratulations.

639
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I applied the same thing even after what the Marines taught me. I applied that side. I regressed.

640
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I didn't have the time to do this. I didn't have the time to do this. I didn't have the time to do this.

641
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Because I wasn't being challenged. And when I went to that school, people started challenged.

642
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You may, the status quo was not good enough. You're better than this. Why are you doing it? Why are you getting out?

643
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000
What are you going to do when you get out? People didn't even ask that that were in your own unit.

644
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
It was like you made your choice. So, right ahead.

645
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.000
What we're going to do? And then you find out, you know, not all units are the same.

646
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And then you also find out when you have goals and things that you want to do, don't let what the perception is of that.

647
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Adjust the goals and the accomplishments that you want to do in your life because people are different.

648
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And you won't put on and the other put on have the basic same things.

649
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It's the leaders and the people in them that make it different. And that is exactly what I saw in this course.

650
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
So, I didn't study. I just became a straight Marine.

651
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And I would turn in my thing and they'd be like, you want to know you're great?

652
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Yeah, you got 102. How do you even get an extra 2 points?

653
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's because you did this and this and went above and beyond for that.

654
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It was the first time somebody said, you'd make a really good instructor.

655
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
He said, you have caring, compassionate, concerned for another human being, very young age to do that.

656
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
What you think? And they made me reach into this box.

657
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
They said, I want you to pull out what, firstly, you're grabbing that box.

658
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Pulled out was a coat hanger.

659
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And then the instructor stared at me and he goes, now I want you to teach me about that coat hanger for five minutes.

660
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And he said this, he goes, what did I say?

661
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I want you to teach me about the coat hanger for five minutes.

662
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
He said, did I say five minutes and five seconds?

663
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Did I say four minutes and 30 seconds?

664
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
He said, you have a 15 second window to fall inside that thing. Now go.

665
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
And I taught him how to jimmy locks. I taught him how to hang clothes.

666
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I taught him how to everything else.

667
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And when I was done and put the coat hanger on there was four minutes and 49 seconds.

668
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
There was no clocks or no watchers in the room.

669
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
It was understanding what the parameters were.

670
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
It was understanding they gave you a task, a condition and a standard.

671
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And then you went to that and said, I think there's going to be a repercussion if I don't come in with it five minutes to do this.

672
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
105 points handed over.

673
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And by the time it was there, all the instructors pulled me back in that room and said, why are you getting out?

674
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
This is what you could be.

675
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I walked away from that school and re-enlisted in the Marine Corps and then stayed for the next almost 30 years.

676
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Because people invested in you.

677
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So then what was your next job after you?

678
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
That school was in seat like an NCO school, like an NCO leadership school.

679
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
It was an NCO leadership school.

680
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
And then I became an Amtrak instructor right out here my first time in Southern California.

681
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
But one of the best two years of my life.

682
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'm in Southern California.

683
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm not at Camp Liger and North Carolina.

684
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And I'm in Camp Delmar on Camp Pendleton, which is right in the boat base and on the beach with everything.

685
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So if there's a place to be in Camp Pendleton, that's the place to be.

686
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And this was before the gigantic first marine expeditionary unit moved in there years later and that.

687
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So this is just a small, it was like being over on the Naval Amt for base at that time here.

688
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Okay.

689
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I don't even know if you go to the exchange over on North Island.

690
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Those flyboys and I could stay over here.

691
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
We got our own little piece on the Amt Fib base to do that.

692
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
That's what Delmar was.

693
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And that's where I learned to be a lead above my pay grade.

694
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Learn to learn to job above you.

695
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Know the jobs below you, but always know the job of the person that's above you.

696
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
It was on that.

697
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And that was the first time that I was truly required to really give back the skills that I thought the Marine Corps.

698
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And that was for a two year period up there.

699
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
The other one was the next billet.

700
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I wanted to be a drone instructor.

701
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
And I remember my drone instructor when he gave me that.

702
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
And I am track thing.

703
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
He said, there's going to be two of you come back to be drone instructors.

704
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And I can remember I wasn't one of them.

705
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Me and he wasn't looking at me when he said that.

706
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000
But in my head, I knew I was going to be one of them.

707
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And did whatever I could do to do that.

708
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
So now I'm in Southern California.

709
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I'm kind of liking it.

710
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And MCRD San Diego is right down here near the Naval Training Center.

711
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I want to go be a drone instructor.

712
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So I came down here from 96 to almost 2000.

713
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I got to push about eight cycles of recruits through here on 62 day training cycles.

714
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
With small breaks in between.

715
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
As a drone instructor, a senior drone instructor.

716
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And then became an academic instructor teaching history.

717
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
For the US Marine Corps over there.

718
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
And you are where you are.

719
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I went down to dental one day just on a routine check and saw this moment in dental.

720
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
It was just like, man, I need to.

721
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I got teeth problems.

722
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
My teeth wasn't hurting or nothing.

723
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And as a drone instructor, I go, you can probably understand.

724
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You don't have any time.

725
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I mean, it's it's 19 and 20 hour days.

726
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
62 straight days.

727
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Somebody's got to be with those recruits in entire time to do that.

728
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Son up, son down.

729
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Then you got to be on deck even staying there throughout the night.

730
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
When they're there and it's a really restricted environment.

731
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I look for every opportunity I could do to take a few recruits down to dental.

732
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
To do that.

733
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And quite frankly, you know, 22 later that was my wife.

734
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And she was working down there.

735
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
She started aglow the computer for about 10 minutes and your coach,

736
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
commenters.

737
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
So this is just a confusion that nobody was going into.

738
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And so that was straight and that was just just a decision.

739
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And that was just a test from the I.

740
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:22.54
I

741
01:14:22.34 --> 01:14:36.000
So this was exactly the we PLN 504 years.

742
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
We were shooting here and we did.

743
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
One day at a time and a Black Traffic Center got patients sitting in the control meeting.

744
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
He'd edited Einstein's on email and booted an assignment.

745
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Last week the VA attended software service all of a sudden.

746
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
As they talked to him but one day he couldn't notice any of his dignity

747
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And they said that we were interacting with those students.

748
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.56
in an avi or naval services unless you become a corpsman, I'm probably never going to see

749
01:14:52.56 --> 01:14:59.44
you because you'll be on the blue side navy for the most time. And my wife was seven years older

750
01:14:59.44 --> 01:15:07.04
than I was at the time and that school's going to hurt and it was right up at Hills at Camp Pendleton

751
01:15:07.60 --> 01:15:13.04
and she threw her hands up and volunteered to become a fleet marine force corpsman. Went up there

752
01:15:13.04 --> 01:15:21.04
through the pack honor she got a FMF device. I did her study and all that stuff that was in there.

753
01:15:21.44 --> 01:15:27.12
I also poured the blood out of her socks and her boots on the hikes and helped pack her frames so

754
01:15:27.12 --> 01:15:31.52
they didn't shift around on her back and do some things up there and I revved the instructors given

755
01:15:31.52 --> 01:15:36.88
me a call saying, they need to make this next hike. Someone were having a harder time. It was on here

756
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:42.56
and I got to go up there and didn't tell her to last participant on the hike. I showed up off the

757
01:15:42.56 --> 01:15:49.12
drill field. Campy up didn't know I was there so I could watch the trail at here. There was going

758
01:15:49.12 --> 01:15:54.88
to go up the hill to do this because selfishly I knew I could go I also knew from my own family not

759
01:15:54.88 --> 01:15:59.92
only would she be a phenomenal corpsman for the navy and the marines. I also knew she needed to get over

760
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:08.000
that hill for what we needed if we were going to have that and I also knew how much of a pride thing

761
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.24
when you thought you'd never be able to achieve that because of all those excuses they were packing

762
01:16:12.24 --> 01:16:20.000
up for your own self you need to get over this hill and she got over there and she stayed with me

763
01:16:20.56 --> 01:16:25.84
for the rest of the time in the marine corps we would slap hands as I would come out of combat and she

764
01:16:25.84 --> 01:16:31.60
would go back into combat and the hardest job that I had was about 2007 when I had to stay back

765
01:16:31.60 --> 01:16:37.12
for seven months and play Mr. Mom to a 13-year-old daughter going through those daughter kind of

766
01:16:37.12 --> 01:16:43.52
things of boy you were a Tom boy about five months ago and we like to do this and now you got

767
01:16:43.52 --> 01:16:49.20
makeup now you have this at mom's not here to deal with this so it was an interesting time.

768
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:54.16
Yeah that's that is an interesting it was quite a leadership challenge.

769
01:16:56.16 --> 01:17:02.32
And you had to do drill instructor and then you did that until 2000 and then we went back out

770
01:17:02.32 --> 01:17:09.84
to campus you know a Carolina for a tour. I kind of always liked to rotate coasts that were there

771
01:17:09.84 --> 01:17:14.96
and also rotate overseas kind of get a more well-rounded thing because we kind of grew up in

772
01:17:14.96 --> 01:17:19.92
communities of where people said they were either on an east coast tour they were west coasters

773
01:17:19.92 --> 01:17:25.28
so they did this and I had the rare opportunity to kind of circumnavigate the globe on do all those

774
01:17:26.48 --> 01:17:30.72
so that took us all the way up to the invasion in 2003.

775
01:17:30.72 --> 01:17:37.84
Where were you on September 11th? On September 11th I was I was at Camp Lijoon

776
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:46.000
and we were doing a non-commissioned officer of the quarterboard that morning and we were outside

777
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000
and somebody in ran outside and just said you never can't believe this some jackass just kind of

778
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.72
flew a plane in the world trades center like and everybody thought it was like a sess now or something

779
01:17:56.72 --> 01:18:02.08
that was here it was true it was no news every just kind of went about their way and that's kind of

780
01:18:02.08 --> 01:18:08.64
weird and then the world changes things later when these kids run out of the company office and we're

781
01:18:08.64 --> 01:18:14.000
all out of the parking lots going that was no sess and a second plane has just hit the other

782
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:22.08
tower that was in there and instantly everybody there was no one questioning if you remember

783
01:18:22.08 --> 01:18:28.24
jack there was no one it was the light that just came on in the darkness when the second plane hit

784
01:18:28.24 --> 01:18:33.92
is we're under attack in the United States so for the next week you don't know where that's coming

785
01:18:33.92 --> 01:18:41.04
from so it can't imagine what we were in charge of security and start to get ammunition and

786
01:18:41.04 --> 01:18:45.52
machine guns out of buildings that normally you're not drawing ammunition and machine guns and

787
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:50.48
you're getting war stock and and then you're putting machine guns on top to barracks roofs

788
01:18:50.48 --> 01:18:57.04
looking for air cover you're stringing concertino over every road possible to prevent what would

789
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:02.48
then be known as v-bids coming in because you don't know where they're coming from you just kind

790
01:19:02.48 --> 01:19:07.04
of stayed there at work for five days trying to figure out everything that was going on and

791
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:11.84
everybody kind of glued to the one TV that's in the company office or wherever it's at trying to get

792
01:19:11.84 --> 01:19:17.12
the news that they can get. So you were you said you were working basic security were you in a

793
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:24.000
battalion or you I was in an operational battalion and basically at the drop of a hat we had to figure

794
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.20
out the MPs can't just secure everything and now it's get to the armory get the heavy weapons

795
01:19:29.20 --> 01:19:34.24
get this okay what what's the ammunition at do we need grenades do we need all this and you're

796
01:19:34.24 --> 01:19:39.76
trying to go through this whole thing and get the nods up it is attack could come at night and

797
01:19:39.76 --> 01:19:43.36
you're basically writing the book because there's no book that's written.

798
01:19:43.36 --> 01:19:50.88
Did you feel like after you got back from the first goal for that maybe after you know another

799
01:19:50.88 --> 01:19:56.56
six months goes by maybe another year go by did you did you feel like the Marine Corps the

800
01:19:56.56 --> 01:20:04.40
US military was in a state of basically you know what are really not going to have to fight another

801
01:20:04.40 --> 01:20:10.64
war I mean the whole world just saw what we did to these guys over here I know I had leadership

802
01:20:10.64 --> 01:20:15.44
that would straight up tell us that you know listen the days of you guys are never going to do

803
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.24
a direct action mission it's just not going to happen and then on top of that we had technology so it was

804
01:20:20.24 --> 01:20:25.20
why would we send you guys to do a direct action mission when we can put a T-lam and a 10-digit grid

805
01:20:25.20 --> 01:20:29.44
why would we have you guys to go do a special reconnaissance when we can fly a drone over we have

806
01:20:29.44 --> 01:20:36.24
satellite imagery that can tell us the same thing so you know I will tell you I never I never bought

807
01:20:36.24 --> 01:20:42.000
into that you know I always thought and hoped that you know I would I would be called upon to

808
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:50.08
do what I was trained to do but it certainly was hard you know and we were off the closest Somalia

809
01:20:50.40 --> 01:20:56.08
so we saw that happen so you maybe you'd get the feeling that maybe there would be some sort of

810
01:20:57.12 --> 01:21:02.80
what we what we used to call the big mission you know we get some one mission in fact a lot of

811
01:21:02.80 --> 01:21:10.32
our training was you know our full mission profiles oftentimes were around like hey this is

812
01:21:10.32 --> 01:21:15.92
a mission this is a mission there's the situation if you're going to do this mission you know

813
01:21:15.92 --> 01:21:18.72
when we worked with the Marine Corps it was always like hey you know this could be a big

814
01:21:18.72 --> 01:21:22.72
and very it's going to last a long time but as far as just the mentality of the seal teams

815
01:21:23.36 --> 01:21:27.36
was very much hey we're probably going to you know you're going to do one mission if you're lucky

816
01:21:27.36 --> 01:21:33.68
if you're lucky you're going to do one mission whether it's a special reconnaissance of one thing

817
01:21:33.68 --> 01:21:39.36
or some kind of a direct action on a ship or a hostage situation and that was kind of it

818
01:21:40.24 --> 01:21:47.60
did you feel like that that attitude was around in the Marine Corps or was there just is there

819
01:21:47.60 --> 01:21:52.000
enough kind of institutional knowledge in the Marine Corps that people said yeah hey you know what it's

820
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.92
peaceful right now but it's a cycle and it'll it'll be back again no because a lot of the people

821
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:03.92
that are involved in that cycle gets out and whether there are a leadership level to influence that

822
01:22:03.92 --> 01:22:10.56
your staff and CEOs and your younger junior officers that were involved in a major conflict in 1991

823
01:22:10.56 --> 01:22:15.04
there's a large probability that over 60% of those guys 10 years later are not going to be wearing

824
01:22:15.04 --> 01:22:21.92
the uniform to be able to train that mentality into another mindset but what I actually did see

825
01:22:21.92 --> 01:22:32.48
was the military was very conflicted at that time because you still had the wall may have been coming

826
01:22:32.48 --> 01:22:37.92
down in Europe and everything else but we had aggregate forces all over the world and all the

827
01:22:37.92 --> 01:22:43.04
sudden you started seeing mission sets diminished that we used to be there used to be the jungle

828
01:22:43.04 --> 01:22:47.60
schools and then you'd have the jungle experts that went to learn how to do that well the focus

829
01:22:47.60 --> 01:22:52.88
wasn't so much on that then you'd have the mountain warriors that went into the mountains like the

830
01:22:52.88 --> 01:22:58.08
10th mountain and everybody else but the 10th mountain that's their job but we have other smaller

831
01:22:58.08 --> 01:23:03.52
forces all throughout the military that go to Bridgeport or they go to Fort McCoy or they go to

832
01:23:03.52 --> 01:23:10.80
A-Dak or they do those and you watched those start to collapse of where we wasn't we wasn't going

833
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:16.80
to Norway the way we were doing we wasn't doing these mission sets that we were doing and then it was

834
01:23:16.80 --> 01:23:24.48
it was large scale now it's going to be desert because after 1991 then Somalia happens right there

835
01:23:24.48 --> 01:23:29.92
so there's more of a middle eastern focus that's now shifting into this whole training paradigm

836
01:23:29.92 --> 01:23:37.92
that's there mixed in with these humanitarian missions like Haiti and everything else that's happening

837
01:23:37.92 --> 01:23:45.84
so you've got forces all over the place and the funny thing is I really truly do hope that in places

838
01:23:45.84 --> 01:23:52.000
in the government and in higher places in uniform above and beyond where you and I ever achieved

839
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.04
to be at you really do hope that that mentality did not sip in and they started to

840
01:23:59.04 --> 01:24:05.28
promulgate it down to do that because that would just tell you that the people that were relying

841
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:11.28
on to know the most about the business of doing warfare don't know as much that we actually believe

842
01:24:11.28 --> 01:24:19.04
that they do because if everything in the context from 1775 all the way up to present day of

843
01:24:19.04 --> 01:24:27.68
America is a blueprint for what is going to happen in the next 20 to 25 years and it is un-disputable

844
01:24:27.68 --> 01:24:33.92
and a training environment to actually think that we are not going to be fighting another large

845
01:24:33.92 --> 01:24:40.32
scale or at this time period while in between that time period are going to go in fight and

846
01:24:40.32 --> 01:24:45.04
four and five other shitty little engagements around the thing the Somalia as the Haiti's

847
01:24:45.04 --> 01:24:49.52
bigger and eight is going to happen and those are going to be compartmentalized not everybody gets

848
01:24:49.52 --> 01:24:54.40
to go to that party and then you got to keep your motivation up you got to train the troops and say

849
01:24:54.40 --> 01:24:59.84
that that's that units mission this time ours will be common ours will do that if you are going

850
01:24:59.84 --> 01:25:06.72
to make a career of a lengthy career in the US military you are going to go to war and there are

851
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:14.56
other services that are going to go parts and pieces maybe before you but you've got everything

852
01:25:14.56 --> 01:25:22.72
from 1775 to 1783 and then there's your big one and then all of a sudden roughly about the

853
01:25:22.72 --> 01:25:28.96
years of 181805 with the barbary pirates and all that we have compartmentalized little things about

854
01:25:28.96 --> 01:25:34.96
there then all of a sudden war of 1812 and that happens everybody's going to the big one

855
01:25:34.96 --> 01:25:41.60
1820s were fighting insurrection with Indians you're fighting a different kind of warfare it's that

856
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:46.88
insurgent small warfare again it's clear and then all of a sudden some way pops in and starts

857
01:25:46.88 --> 01:25:52.96
going we're going to Mexico everybody's going to Mexico City then you compartmentalize that

858
01:25:53.60 --> 01:26:00.72
then you get 1861 to 65 the whole show goes to town following that 60s and 70s then you hit the

859
01:26:00.72 --> 01:26:07.12
Spanish American war that comes in just after the Spanish American war war war one kicks off

860
01:26:07.12 --> 01:26:11.92
banana wars happen after that we start learning how to develop an amphibious doctrine

861
01:26:11.92 --> 01:26:16.56
throughout the Pacific guys like Pete Ellis are out there saying that the Japanese are going to

862
01:26:16.56 --> 01:26:22.24
strike into Pacific we have people in jungle training like Chesteepuller and all those learning these

863
01:26:22.24 --> 01:26:29.52
jungle skills in Nicaragua in Haiti and all these small little wars at that time period and then

864
01:26:29.52 --> 01:26:35.84
we come out the small wars period 1941 1945 for the Indian State's is in the big one

865
01:26:36.40 --> 01:26:42.08
everybody goes home again put the uniforms up rupture duck goes on the sleeves let's go start

866
01:26:42.08 --> 01:26:47.44
work in the Chrysler holy shit the Pusan perimeter and we're down about a hundred thousand

867
01:26:47.44 --> 01:26:53.92
truth because we let everybody go home get them all back out there 51 to 53 then you're starting

868
01:26:53.92 --> 01:27:00.48
back into the Dominican Republic and these small little things 58 and then Vietnam hits and runs

869
01:27:00.48 --> 01:27:07.92
all the way from the early years of 61 all the way to 75 bad mindset comes out of there people are

870
01:27:07.92 --> 01:27:14.72
tired a lot of the NCO core leaves the trainers leave that's on there and then we rebuild this

871
01:27:14.72 --> 01:27:22.32
force of small wars in the 80s again crannata Lebanon they root bombing happens the first terrorist

872
01:27:22.32 --> 01:27:29.68
action targeting the United States military in centuries happens at that because it was an act of war

873
01:27:29.68 --> 01:27:34.56
by the Japanese on December 7 but that wasn't an act of war that was a truck bomb going into a

874
01:27:34.56 --> 01:27:40.56
marine barracks that killed 243 people when they were sleeping it was in there kind of round about

875
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:45.60
way gets to what you were talking about I go it's when you start letting things down rules of

876
01:27:45.60 --> 01:27:51.12
engagement are different you can't fire until fire to pawn you're in a police action you're not in

877
01:27:51.12 --> 01:27:58.24
a designated war and then you get through Noriaga you roll right into the desert storm there's your

878
01:27:58.24 --> 01:28:03.68
big one again you roll right into the small east the small wars and then we've been fighting

879
01:28:03.68 --> 01:28:10.64
never since in the major wars and also the small ones I believe our small war period started again

880
01:28:11.20 --> 01:28:16.72
roughly about the 2008 time period because if you actually look at that clock and I just now

881
01:28:16.72 --> 01:28:26.72
every 20 to 25 years this nation all has to mount up and go fight somebody everybody on a bigger

882
01:28:26.72 --> 01:28:34.56
scale to do that all the ways since 1775 and then in the next one of your period we have to

883
01:28:34.56 --> 01:28:40.32
reposition we have to rebuild and we have to spite these small little compressed areas around the

884
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:46.96
things and prepare for the next one because history tells us the next one is eventually going to

885
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:53.76
happen and if that's going to be an invasion of in-shan of which what you were saying is there

886
01:28:53.76 --> 01:29:01.04
a certain skill sense let's take the amphibious warriors that we have out there today you know they've been

887
01:29:01.04 --> 01:29:06.56
being told now that they'll never be another scale of D-day they'll never be another scale of this

888
01:29:06.56 --> 01:29:13.20
and you know what to an extent you have to weigh where you need to put those forces now

889
01:29:13.20 --> 01:29:18.64
to where you need to put those forces somewhere in the future and at the same time maybe a fire down here

890
01:29:19.20 --> 01:29:24.16
on one of our LHAs and a few other things you just got taken offline when we've been running those

891
01:29:24.16 --> 01:29:29.52
ships ragged for about the past 20 years to in and out of dry docks and everything else puts us

892
01:29:29.52 --> 01:29:36.64
probably in one of the most vulnerable times again prior to 1941 we've been fighting for 20 years

893
01:29:36.64 --> 01:29:42.48
we've been recycling that equipment we've been throwing people into the breach 7 8 9 and 10 times

894
01:29:43.04 --> 01:29:49.44
we have sons and daughters that are now fighting the same war that their fathers and mothers went in

895
01:29:51.44 --> 01:29:57.52
the resilience of the American people is strong but it's going to be tested it's going to be tested very soon

896
01:29:57.52 --> 01:30:07.60
I was up in Montana a few weeks ago and I was doing a archer issue bunch of people from all over

897
01:30:07.60 --> 01:30:12.24
the country and you're out in little small groups and I'm seeing a bunch of military guys and

898
01:30:12.88 --> 01:30:18.24
they're saying what's up and I could do this once bought and I see this guy coming over to Hale

899
01:30:18.24 --> 01:30:25.20
and he's I don't know maybe he's 28 30 years old something like that got long hair beard

900
01:30:25.20 --> 01:30:34.56
scrappy looking guy and he sees me as eyes light up and you know he's got the big smile on his face and

901
01:30:34.56 --> 01:30:43.20
comes over and he says he says hey sir awesome to see you simplify kill

902
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:50.72
and you know so we talked a little bit he's in the Marine Corps all my yards and I'm you know

903
01:30:50.72 --> 01:30:56.48
you're out there walking these mountains and I'm thinking of myself that guy

904
01:31:00.72 --> 01:31:06.96
we're always going to have to have that guy we're always going to have to have that guy if anybody

905
01:31:06.96 --> 01:31:18.08
ever thinks that you don't need that soldier or marine that's going to mount up

906
01:31:18.08 --> 01:31:27.92
and go to wherever they get sent and take that mission and risk their lives

907
01:31:29.44 --> 01:31:35.28
and kill the enemy if you ever think that we don't need that guy and it just gave me great

908
01:31:35.28 --> 01:31:44.40
reassurance because he's out of the Marine Corps but he's out there and there's

909
01:31:44.40 --> 01:31:50.48
that's something we need to make sure that we always have and I think it's part of our

910
01:31:50.48 --> 01:31:58.32
instinct I think it's part of being an American but if we ever decide that maybe we need to

911
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:08.16
dispel that attitude from our society we're heading down the wrong road in my opinion

912
01:32:08.16 --> 01:32:16.64
because the world the world's a nice place when you live in America but America's not the

913
01:32:16.64 --> 01:32:23.84
world and there's evil out there and there has to be people that have the attitude that

914
01:32:23.84 --> 01:32:29.20
when the call comes they'll go and they'll go and handle that problem. You know too really good

915
01:32:29.20 --> 01:32:34.16
you'd said with that you said when earlier when you were getting at people were developing

916
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:41.12
and utilizing modern-day technology as the basis of not having to send a man or a woman into a

917
01:32:41.12 --> 01:32:46.96
fight whether we're going to put AI and aircraft or they're going to do that I'm a armed believer

918
01:32:46.96 --> 01:32:54.48
I go that all of that is a battle enhancer that is not what you build the platform on the man

919
01:32:54.48 --> 01:33:00.16
and the woman is the platform that you invest in and you build you build the resiliency into them

920
01:33:00.16 --> 01:33:05.44
you build the determination the strength the warrior spirit the fight you put that into them

921
01:33:05.44 --> 01:33:10.16
and it doesn't matter if it's 20 years old I think it's even better when they hear that fire

922
01:33:10.16 --> 01:33:16.16
coming out of somebody that's 50 and 51 and everything else and you talked to some guy that came

923
01:33:16.16 --> 01:33:21.60
across the beaches of Tarra with its 94 and they're a crisp quaren concise and as a day and they're

924
01:33:21.60 --> 01:33:26.16
basically looking at you going don't screw this up on your watch man we held the line on our

925
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:33.60
watch and I believe generationally we all have a responsibility to do that make no mistake

926
01:33:34.40 --> 01:33:41.76
war will never become so advanced to where you can hold a piece of ground without putting a

927
01:33:41.76 --> 01:33:47.68
person on that ground to hold that piece of ground in that battle space you can cover it by fire

928
01:33:47.68 --> 01:33:52.96
you can cover avenues you can cover large swathas that are out there but if you want to go down

929
01:33:52.96 --> 01:33:58.96
and actually get at the business of what war is related to you are going to have to put a

930
01:33:58.96 --> 01:34:05.68
man or a woman in a battle space to control that from the ground this is exactly why we use

931
01:34:05.68 --> 01:34:10.40
forward air controllers that are out there you don't fire missions onto something that you don't

932
01:34:10.40 --> 01:34:15.68
lace a target you don't have that in we don't drop dumb bombs from peace out it tames anymore

933
01:34:15.68 --> 01:34:20.08
and just because people believe that we have laser guided munitions and all this other stuff

934
01:34:20.08 --> 01:34:25.44
or as the naval threat is becoming the a2d2 standoff distance and they don't want to fight

935
01:34:25.44 --> 01:34:30.000
in the lotorals because they don't believe we have to drop marines into the lotorals that much

936
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.76
anymore to swim those infantry men ashore that is on that and then the nation might start making

937
01:34:36.48 --> 01:34:40.96
ships that don't have well decks and a many more and it takes that capability off of the

938
01:34:40.96 --> 01:34:47.28
table to do that because you and I talked before ospreys hellowing elements a lot of these platforms

939
01:34:47.28 --> 01:34:52.64
that's the solution that's here you know what the battle ship was the solution to the

940
01:34:52.64 --> 01:35:01.20
unique the aircraft carrier was the solution to the battleship the toys are not what makes the fight

941
01:35:01.20 --> 01:35:08.16
in the fight comes from the heart and it comes from how you grow the next generation to utilize

942
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:12.48
the enhancements that you're going to give them and you give them the best enhancements that

943
01:35:12.48 --> 01:35:17.20
you possibly can to do that but you do not put in enhancement on the battlefield that can

944
01:35:17.20 --> 01:35:23.12
not be employed by somebody tactically that doesn't have the resilience and the knowledge to control

945
01:35:23.12 --> 01:35:30.80
that rules of engagement I will never forget I went to a combat resiliency conference before

946
01:35:30.80 --> 01:35:36.000
I was getting out of the marine core and I had to get up and I had to talk and we had everybody

947
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.88
from the army they Air Force and everybody the one that I was very most interested in it wasn't

948
01:35:42.88 --> 01:35:47.60
the combat resiliency from us as marines because you're in the six foot fight with somebody

949
01:35:47.60 --> 01:35:52.08
or the teams that are going to go in and they're going to throw dogs and they're going to hit

950
01:35:52.08 --> 01:35:57.76
on target they're looking at watches we got this much time on the ground we have to get abnc

951
01:35:57.76 --> 01:36:01.84
tertiary targets primaries we got everything here and you're making those calculated things

952
01:36:01.84 --> 01:36:08.16
now the average person we don't that carries the rest of the military there are supply troops

953
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:14.24
and everybody else it does that but when I heard an Air Force lieutenant Colonel say one of the

954
01:36:14.24 --> 01:36:19.84
biggest problems they're having right now is the current resiliency of the mental fullness of

955
01:36:19.84 --> 01:36:29.68
their drone pilots I kind of sent up a receipt and they explained it as it's one thing to be standing

956
01:36:29.68 --> 01:36:34.56
in Afghanistan I rock and you're having to six foot fighting you're doing that and there is that

957
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:39.76
risk that is involved into that right then you go you do your mission you do your direct action

958
01:36:39.76 --> 01:36:44.64
you come back you debrief you do your equipment you do that you get cocked and reset because you're

959
01:36:44.64 --> 01:36:51.76
still in the zone because I'm in Iraq and I'm in Afghanistan and she said we kind of wasn't

960
01:36:51.76 --> 01:36:56.24
prepared and I know we're more prepared and I believe they're totally prepared now because this

961
01:36:56.24 --> 01:37:01.28
was years ago at the impancy of when we're going to have enlisted drone pilots we're going

962
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:07.20
to start flying drones out of these cans out of places in the United States to where these people

963
01:37:07.20 --> 01:37:13.60
show up to work in the morning get a debrief on a thing do a battle handover and then fly

964
01:37:13.60 --> 01:37:19.52
on some missions and predators and that that at the end of the day somebody puts a board

965
01:37:19.52 --> 01:37:24.80
up like they didn't Vietnam and go well we had five today walks out there and then you get back

966
01:37:24.80 --> 01:37:31.76
in your car your wife causja and says can you pick up Burger King on the way home yeah and then

967
01:37:31.76 --> 01:37:35.92
tomorrow morning at eight in the morning you're going to go back and that box again and it's not

968
01:37:35.92 --> 01:37:42.16
a game those are lives on the other side of that and that is the evolution of warfare that I believe

969
01:37:42.16 --> 01:37:48.000
that you have to prepare the person for when you put that on to shoulder that responsibility

970
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.88
and not take away that because of the technological enhancements you and I are talking about

971
01:37:52.88 --> 01:37:59.04
it scares the world doesn't matter when they hear that there is a seal team that just hit something

972
01:37:59.92 --> 01:38:03.76
the teams usually go on by the time the news is there and they find out that that

973
01:38:03.76 --> 01:38:09.04
incursion just happened in a place in the world that nobody was looking it strikes the hair

974
01:38:09.04 --> 01:38:12.88
on the back of somebody's neck okay America still watch and they have this capability

975
01:38:12.88 --> 01:38:17.04
they're out there whether it's a delta whether it's anybody it's on that but may

976
01:38:17.04 --> 01:38:24.000
know mistake the world knows America's really serious when a young Lance corporal or a pfc

977
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.44
in the army with a bayonet on the end of the rifle wades a shore and stands on a piece of sand

978
01:38:30.24 --> 01:38:34.48
and then they have a battalion that's coming behind them that makes more than people's

979
01:38:34.48 --> 01:38:39.20
hair on the back of their next stand up it says it we ain't going to get rid of these guys

980
01:38:39.20 --> 01:38:44.72
anytime soon and if we don't behave I hate to see what else they're going to throw inside of here

981
01:38:44.72 --> 01:38:52.16
so you are spot on and then go of saying that it is always going to be the person and I mean that's

982
01:38:52.16 --> 01:38:56.64
right back to that mindset of Teddy Roosevelt the man in the arena today it's the man in

983
01:38:56.64 --> 01:39:01.12
woman in the arena because their lives are out there on the line to do that whether it's blue

984
01:39:01.12 --> 01:39:08.72
lives whether it's military lives or anybody else but to have that mindset we can never lose the

985
01:39:08.72 --> 01:39:20.88
mindset of fielding people who want to be in the arena how long did it take for you to get

986
01:39:20.88 --> 01:39:29.04
your for your battalion to know that you guys were going to spin up and and head over and 2003

987
01:39:29.04 --> 01:39:34.96
we were on leave we got called I was putting a unit that we only had a few months to train

988
01:39:34.96 --> 01:39:39.52
up until that time period so we kept in the field last together we kind of went on leave and we

989
01:39:39.52 --> 01:39:44.40
got called off a leave and said that everybody else from most parts going to fly over but we

990
01:39:44.40 --> 01:39:49.84
need you to take your tracks and get on the ships and you're going to ride the ships over that was

991
01:39:49.84 --> 01:39:56.16
here and we rode the last trips of the USS port one it was pretty awesome I wanted I always

992
01:39:56.16 --> 01:40:00.96
loved the smaller ships than the bigger ships I mean they ride differently and that that's a little

993
01:40:00.96 --> 01:40:07.36
bit weird but the camaraderie with the navy crew that you have on a smaller ship especially when

994
01:40:07.36 --> 01:40:12.24
you're driving amphibious tanks and everything else is the first people other than the ships captain

995
01:40:12.24 --> 01:40:18.24
the exo and the CMC and that that you check in on there is you always check in with the mess chief

996
01:40:18.24 --> 01:40:22.40
make sure that guy's got his dust square away right you check in with the bill and he's

997
01:40:22.40 --> 01:40:27.52
showing more the rat the third people is all the damage control people and everything else on the

998
01:40:27.52 --> 01:40:32.80
ship that has the machinery that can help you fix the equipment it's in that well tech whether they're

999
01:40:32.80 --> 01:40:38.48
brazers whether they have welding capabilities because some of the best people I've ever seen in my

1000
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:44.24
life they can turn a piece of sheet metal into something is a sailor in the US navy and that it's

1001
01:40:44.24 --> 01:40:49.92
their home and they got nowhere else to go so they do the most resilient things to patch things to

1002
01:40:49.92 --> 01:40:54.80
well things to do what they have to do and there's a lot of times I have to go inside of there

1003
01:40:54.80 --> 01:40:59.20
and go you don't know me for China all of but I don't have a weld around here right now and that

1004
01:40:59.20 --> 01:41:02.88
can you come down here and braze a three inch thing that's on this armored vehicle

1005
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.80
yeah and it's pretty cool you throw them a coin you throw them a K bar something for some great work

1006
01:41:09.92 --> 01:41:15.20
because it's a people business you build assets and comronery that way you don't build an

1007
01:41:15.20 --> 01:41:20.48
adversarial nature by being the Marines issue up on the ship and they put everybody on water hours

1008
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:26.000
because the Marines take showers at a five minutes long or anything else you just kind of you know

1009
01:41:26.64 --> 01:41:31.68
who's house you're in and you build that report because they're going to water too and they have a

1010
01:41:31.68 --> 01:41:36.80
mission and you're really and their mission isn't just to drop you off they tie into a bigger

1011
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:42.40
mission they're kind of hoping in that comronery that they see you come back and to be looking at

1012
01:41:42.40 --> 01:41:48.48
your naval brothers to go when you get push shore go we'll be here we'll be here when you get back

1013
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:53.36
we don't know what we're going to be doing we'll be here the Portland wasn't there

1014
01:41:54.16 --> 01:41:58.48
because that thing was part of the decommissioning just to get us into the thing of the fleet

1015
01:41:58.48 --> 01:42:05.84
was that an LPD yeah yeah a small little a sweet pea it was called you know and it's kind of

1016
01:42:05.84 --> 01:42:10.80
sitting about 17,000 feet below the waves and it's one of those things it's just a great little

1017
01:42:10.80 --> 01:42:16.80
ship from a great city that was out there I mean the USS Portland's that held that name before that

1018
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:22.000
these are ships that were in doies battle line and everything before and naming of these ships and these

1019
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.68
cities and when you were talking about do you think that people sometimes lost their way on what they were

1020
01:42:27.68 --> 01:42:34.72
doing you know like the naming of naval ships and you look around the world and you see the

1021
01:42:34.72 --> 01:42:39.92
publisher you see the invincible and you see different things that are out there one that

1022
01:42:39.92 --> 01:42:45.60
built pride in your own ship that was here more importantly is when the anime kind of sees a

1023
01:42:45.60 --> 01:42:49.68
floatella coming at them and they see the names of these ships that are actually coming that

1024
01:42:49.68 --> 01:42:54.96
leads to a mindset of the people that are on that ship in a country behind that ship so when we're

1025
01:42:54.96 --> 01:43:00.88
we're one we're sending the rules of Elts out are we're naming these cities and right

1026
01:43:00.88 --> 01:43:05.92
down to these little LSTs that we're called barber counties and harland counties and these were

1027
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:13.12
produced to represent these Americans who were the fabric of our nation who are there and then you

1028
01:43:13.12 --> 01:43:20.40
just kind of see how that name can get over here where is this at and how are we naming these

1029
01:43:20.40 --> 01:43:25.28
things that are on here rather than you know my wife and I chuckle jacco that's on here and

1030
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.68
and I try to reduce my amount of cussing over the years it's not so grand fatherly when you're

1031
01:43:31.68 --> 01:43:40.96
out there but on the screen in the TV I grew up with the recruiting of the U.S. Navy

1032
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:48.000
right seeing the posters of stripped of the money sandlers throwing depth charges sand joined the

1033
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:53.84
U.S. Navy showing this brown water navy boats going in there and doing business on the

1034
01:43:53.84 --> 01:43:58.88
anime tiger stripe cambys you've name it that was doing this and then here for a while

1035
01:43:58.88 --> 01:44:04.64
you know we've got it's not a job it's an adventure we have this we have this and all the

1036
01:44:04.64 --> 01:44:10.24
sudden you start the troops start talking it's kind of like what is our identity right now

1037
01:44:10.24 --> 01:44:15.12
and my the Pepsi generation am I the join the Navy see the world generation am I that you know

1038
01:44:15.12 --> 01:44:19.68
the Marines are the Semperfidelis we didn't promise you a damn rose garden type generation

1039
01:44:19.68 --> 01:44:26.000
and we don't jockey with our message like a lot to do that but the best thing that I have seen

1040
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.72
the Navy years is I heard a rumble in my house because I'm hard of hearing so the volumes up

1041
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:38.64
I heard a rumble and I saw an aircraft carrier come from the right sand side of the screen

1042
01:44:38.64 --> 01:44:43.92
with a full battle line up across the top of that and it crueged across that thing in the

1043
01:44:43.92 --> 01:44:50.24
house was like rumble I yelled in my wife like baby you get down here you're your your commercial

1044
01:44:50.24 --> 01:44:55.76
is on right she runs down she's laughing at me jaco and here comes this thing you see the white

1045
01:44:55.76 --> 01:45:00.96
caps coming and it's rumble and you know the commercial it's here and then at the same it's

1046
01:45:00.96 --> 01:45:07.52
hand-end of that it's like the United States Navy a global force for good and I just looked at her

1047
01:45:07.52 --> 01:45:14.08
and I said we wouldn't be married for 22 years if I got us all freaking choked up to like like do some

1048
01:45:14.08 --> 01:45:20.32
stuff tonight and then it's kind of like okay baby you ready we're working it this and then this

1049
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:24.24
is how we're going to drop the ending on this thing I said probably wouldn't be your husband

1050
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:30.80
for the past 22 years and you know what I loved it I loved the messaging that it had that was

1051
01:45:30.80 --> 01:45:36.000
on there because the messaging the politically incorrect messaging that should have came on

1052
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:42.56
then at the United States Navy we will completely destroy your way of life it's the same one to this

1053
01:45:43.20 --> 01:45:48.88
and then things like listing the battle things of saying this is just one we have quite a few more

1054
01:45:48.88 --> 01:45:53.92
of these and then more importantly is once again you don't pick it up out the machines you make

1055
01:45:53.92 --> 01:45:59.92
it about the person and when people start seeing recruiting losers that actually have the resilience

1056
01:45:59.92 --> 01:46:04.72
and the fighting thing I've seen America's army come out they're actually really good ones they

1057
01:46:04.72 --> 01:46:08.96
got some door kicking things I mean they're actually targeting like we want infantry maple

1058
01:46:09.76 --> 01:46:14.64
I've seen that for a lot of years to do that and it's awesome you still see naval special

1059
01:46:14.64 --> 01:46:20.56
warfare commercials out there are targeting a generation of the next generation that has to go

1060
01:46:20.56 --> 01:46:29.20
forward and do these things I'm not sold on the fact I go that we should be selling a lot of

1061
01:46:29.20 --> 01:46:35.60
skills that are on there you know that's a recruiters job let's get them in the recruiters let's

1062
01:46:35.60 --> 01:46:40.16
kind of pump them up let's get them to that but I also know that I had one I'm saying Justin we

1063
01:46:40.16 --> 01:46:45.12
don't want to scare anybody that's on there because we've got to get people to come to the door

1064
01:46:45.92 --> 01:46:53.36
and I said the right ones will come to the door the other ones you'll do a little bit more work

1065
01:46:53.36 --> 01:46:56.40
for but you'll find them in those high schools and you're doing another thing but

1066
01:46:56.40 --> 01:47:01.84
if you're getting scared by a commercial I don't think I want you here yeah it ain't it's

1067
01:47:01.84 --> 01:47:10.24
or it rattled that's exactly right I don't want you here so how early for the invasion did you

1068
01:47:10.24 --> 01:47:19.28
guys get to the staging point we landed and we moved about a 30 day movement up into our TAAs

1069
01:47:19.28 --> 01:47:25.04
are tactical assembly areas that are on there so we landed in Kuwait to move a good way

1070
01:47:25.04 --> 01:47:29.68
land we didn't low boy we didn't do a lot of those you're driving up into a lot of these positions

1071
01:47:29.68 --> 01:47:34.56
uh to do a couple of weeks of training it was there but we only learned the mission that we were

1072
01:47:34.56 --> 01:47:40.40
gonna have to take those bridges down we didn't know until we actually got up physically to the

1073
01:47:40.40 --> 01:47:46.64
tactical assembly areas what month did you guys set sail to have in January and then we landed in

1074
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:52.08
the end of February so we were on the ground and started making our movement on February 18th and

1075
01:47:52.08 --> 01:47:58.24
19th up into the northern portion of Kuwait just below the border so both these wars for you

1076
01:47:58.24 --> 01:48:02.88
you showed up very short didn't have to sit around in the desert like everybody else for nine

1077
01:48:02.88 --> 01:48:06.80
months or eleven months here the man I was down the track I was down the track I was down the

1078
01:48:06.80 --> 01:48:10.48
rodman and the thing when somebody's you know you're eating the cheese burger saying you

1079
01:48:10.48 --> 01:48:14.16
need to get your sweats off they're about to walk on to the thing yeah well we're about to play

1080
01:48:14.16 --> 01:48:19.12
a world championship hey can you come on over here right now absolutely dang so you got up there you

1081
01:48:19.12 --> 01:48:26.000
said February 18th got up there in February we offload in February and Kuwait and then we made the

1082
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:31.60
march up into the northern portion of Kuwait to stage where we're gonna go through the breech

1083
01:48:31.60 --> 01:48:38.64
lanes into Iraq and then going in going into this how did the attitude compare to what you

1084
01:48:38.64 --> 01:48:44.000
experience in the first Gulf War of of of your fellow Marines the attitude was absolutely

1085
01:48:44.72 --> 01:48:48.24
there was no problem getting any Marines to do anything with the problem keeping them from doing

1086
01:48:48.24 --> 01:48:54.16
something because they still had the twin towers burning in their head used to have people in your

1087
01:48:54.16 --> 01:49:00.72
platoon that were in New York when that actually happened and it joined the Marines a couple of years

1088
01:49:01.20 --> 01:49:07.92
later so they were kids that were 70 that was the catalyst to make them Marines and you have that

1089
01:49:07.92 --> 01:49:14.80
fight of you did this and that that was the energy that was going in as we you know some of us

1090
01:49:14.80 --> 01:49:20.88
who were here the first time knew that we were gonna be back there again because people had always

1091
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:26.72
chastised or whatever or armchair quarterback George Bush's decision on should he have just pushed

1092
01:49:26.72 --> 01:49:32.000
the troops up into buying dad and knocked out Sonom and saying in 1991 and the mission was

1093
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.36
get him out of Kuwait put him back in the wrong house and then he pulled back we kind of I kind of

1094
01:49:37.36 --> 01:49:42.32
knew when I was running enemy prisoners a war in the back of those amtrax in 1991

1095
01:49:42.32 --> 01:49:47.60
a lot of those kids didn't want to be there but the older warriors did and their lieutenant

1096
01:49:47.60 --> 01:49:54.24
kernels and their senior NCOs they had been through the Iran war and everything else the look

1097
01:49:54.24 --> 01:50:00.80
that they had on their face was trust me man this is not over these kids that are in here

1098
01:50:00.80 --> 01:50:06.32
don't have the fight and didn't grow up with that my generation still around and I still remember

1099
01:50:06.32 --> 01:50:15.12
a lieutenant kernel sitting in the back and I remember how dumb I was because I had a knife like

1100
01:50:15.12 --> 01:50:20.40
on the top shoulder of my flat jacket so I could get to it but I was sitting on a cam in it

1101
01:50:20.40 --> 01:50:26.48
against engine panels like I watched everybody in the crew compartment but I remember my weapon

1102
01:50:26.48 --> 01:50:33.04
at the time was like in a condition one weapon with it on fire wouldn't even meant it would have

1103
01:50:33.04 --> 01:50:39.84
been condition one on safe but you're in close quarter and you have a long rifle in here and

1104
01:50:39.84 --> 01:50:44.08
that's the ignorance that you have as a kid you feel you're protected I have this they don't want

1105
01:50:44.08 --> 01:50:51.04
to find anymore but I also looked up in out the cargo hatches in my plutones sergeant had the

1106
01:50:51.04 --> 01:50:55.68
weapon station turned all the way to the back with the now's a net depressed end of the back of

1107
01:50:55.68 --> 01:51:02.48
the neural and the other E7 that was in this hatch was leaning and riding the vehicle backwards

1108
01:51:02.48 --> 01:51:09.28
with a baretta and was in Overwatch of me down there in other words they probably wasn't so scared

1109
01:51:09.28 --> 01:51:15.36
to me because they were probably scared those crazy guys will fire into the back of your and kill

1110
01:51:15.36 --> 01:51:20.96
even if the risk of killing one the run so we didn't have any problem pornal going into that

1111
01:51:20.96 --> 01:51:27.84
training at mindset that we're going into their backyard this time with the greatest marines that we

1112
01:51:27.84 --> 01:51:32.08
could put forward on the field of battle at that time and all the other cohesive forces going

1113
01:51:32.08 --> 01:51:37.92
into there there there was not a mindset other than let's just get the show started did you think

1114
01:51:38.88 --> 01:51:43.52
look I know you're you said that you thought hey we're going into there we're going into their

1115
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:49.04
territory now this is actually where they live we're probably going to see more resistance

1116
01:51:49.76 --> 01:51:54.16
was that widespread or did a lot of people think hey man we you know we're probably looking

1117
01:51:54.16 --> 01:51:59.76
two weeks at the most I know I was worried about that which is a weird thing to say but I was thinking

1118
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:03.92
because I was not over there and I was thinking I'm gonna miss this it's gonna be over in a few

1119
01:52:03.92 --> 01:52:10.96
weeks or at least it could be what what did you see we talked about that in training earlier

1120
01:52:10.96 --> 01:52:15.52
at different units trained to a different mentality that was here I couldn't wait to speak to the

1121
01:52:15.52 --> 01:52:22.96
one we trained to we trained to be there to basically prevent and where I could from ever being able

1122
01:52:22.96 --> 01:52:28.40
to do this again to somebody else at that and it wasn't going to be a 1991 it was not going to

1123
01:52:28.40 --> 01:52:32.24
be they're just going to throw up their hands and they're going to walk away to do that but I'm not

1124
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:38.72
telling you I go that other people were like that that you saw in training areas or you didn't see

1125
01:52:38.72 --> 01:52:45.04
putting in the hours and the reps and the sets that it actually took to lay the maps and talk the

1126
01:52:45.04 --> 01:52:52.56
history and and kind of really ingrained that mindset into somebody it was overall the Marines

1127
01:52:52.56 --> 01:52:59.36
had the mindset subunit levels that were on there it always goes back to whatever the commander

1128
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:03.52
whatever the ownership is going to make it focus a training at that time period because you can

1129
01:53:03.52 --> 01:53:08.16
have the higher authority the basic we're going to go in and we're going to do this mission

1130
01:53:08.16 --> 01:53:14.72
but the people that you train each sleep breathe with that put that into you is normally not the

1131
01:53:14.72 --> 01:53:20.40
chief and naval operations or the common on the Marine Corps it is your lieutenant colonel it is your

1132
01:53:20.40 --> 01:53:25.28
captain it's your lieutenant your gun resort and your chief petty officer or it's your guy on

1133
01:53:25.28 --> 01:53:31.28
your left and the right so I couldn't have a more cohesive unit that went in for the short amount

1134
01:53:31.28 --> 01:53:35.68
of time that we did because I all do believe that they didn't believe this was going to be a

1135
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:41.28
two-in-a-q man and we're out of here I think they actually were very fearful when they kind of

1136
01:53:41.28 --> 01:53:48.08
knew the major thing is to now take this guy out and we're going to do it in such a manner and

1137
01:53:48.08 --> 01:53:53.68
such a speed that was out here that we're sitting there with these vehicles they're left over from

1138
01:53:53.68 --> 01:53:58.40
the end of Vietnam when they were brand new going we're going to push him across the desert

1139
01:53:58.40 --> 01:54:03.52
sometimes at night sometimes when they'll maps sometimes broken down and they have to leave that

1140
01:54:03.52 --> 01:54:08.96
one back with a crew to fix it and then they have to travel 80 miles to catch up with the rest of the

1141
01:54:08.96 --> 01:54:13.52
crew and they're out of radio rains so at night you're just kind of looking at the tracks that

1142
01:54:13.52 --> 01:54:18.40
you can follow to try to catch up and then you call in these radio things to get within that

1143
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:23.52
radio range and you don't even know if you're driving through a bazillion mind-feel or anything else

1144
01:54:23.52 --> 01:54:34.32
that is out there that's focus. When the invasion kicked off what were you guys doing immediately

1145
01:54:34.32 --> 01:54:40.88
were you guys rolling up what was that March 20th? We were already in position and

1146
01:54:40.88 --> 01:54:47.20
rolling and refueling we kicked off on about March 19th and started to track up because you're talking

1147
01:54:47.20 --> 01:54:52.48
hundreds of miles that was in there and again fixing things along the way whatever you have to do

1148
01:54:52.48 --> 01:54:56.64
because the thing was push push push push push push you can't stop you can't do this

1149
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
which really bonds to that old thing we were talking about like the USS Indianapolis

1150
01:55:02.80 --> 01:55:07.52
you know it was maintain radio silence keep pushing keep pushing don't give away positions don't do

1151
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:13.44
whatever you have to do right get to the end of the result and but we started top and often

1152
01:55:13.44 --> 01:55:19.28
refueling about the 21st it was kind of the invasion load for the fuel we've already loaded with

1153
01:55:19.28 --> 01:55:26.08
ammunition you already loaded with everything the 22nd rolls into there and you instantly know the call

1154
01:55:26.08 --> 01:55:32.48
is the 23rd is going to go into the city and then that's when you've already rehearsed at your position

1155
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:38.96
to take a certain bridge here's your mission and here's the time and date stamp that you have to

1156
01:55:38.96 --> 01:55:44.56
be accomplished by whether it is set in office zero four in the morning to get to a bridge by zero

1157
01:55:44.56 --> 01:55:50.56
late so that you have somebody that is here so did you but Talian get tasked to take

1158
01:55:50.56 --> 01:55:56.48
nausea yeah the entire task force it was called ironically task force tarl and task force tarl

1159
01:55:56.48 --> 01:56:02.88
was first beti in second marines and that was completely away in its own task force and that task

1160
01:56:02.88 --> 01:56:08.72
force was to secure the bridges of Nazareia so that the entire first marine division and the army

1161
01:56:08.72 --> 01:56:13.20
and everybody else could pass through that city all the way up the route and make a straight

1162
01:56:13.20 --> 01:56:18.96
shot up the banged in so that's why they needed those bridges what was the intel telling you about

1163
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:24.32
the resistance you're going to face the resistance was about 500,000 people inside of a city so it

1164
01:56:24.32 --> 01:56:30.40
was a large major city it's a time frame it was bracketed by the Uprates and the Saddam Canal

1165
01:56:31.36 --> 01:56:39.20
that was on that and at the time there was small units and it was a headquarters of the Iraqi

1166
01:56:39.20 --> 01:56:43.52
Fedahine that was down there so we kind of knew more of your fanatical fighters were going to be

1167
01:56:43.52 --> 01:56:49.68
inside of that area the 51st mechanized division was down there and we still knew that Iraq

1168
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:54.72
still had a willing a means to fight so you still had these capabilities that they could probably

1169
01:56:54.72 --> 01:57:00.16
put it good hard on you but we still had the capabilities that nobody was for seeing

1170
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:05.36
the bus saw that was going to happen when when we crossed over those bridges that morning on the 23rd

1171
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:15.28
U.S. debriefing your your portunes like out in the field or you in the assembly area how

1172
01:57:15.28 --> 01:57:20.40
is the word getting transmitted to the troops you're already doing the pre briefs that are out there

1173
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:26.96
in the days leading up to that once we got everything else is kind of on the move one time I've got

1174
01:57:26.96 --> 01:57:32.16
six different radio nets that are going on inside of my helmet little box down here that I can switch

1175
01:57:32.16 --> 01:57:38.64
between battalion tack one tack to fires anything else while you're still maintaining your

1176
01:57:38.64 --> 01:57:43.04
communications for your inner comms for your vehicles you're still maintaining tactical control

1177
01:57:43.04 --> 01:57:49.44
of your own people in relation to the battle that was on there and once the things are rolling

1178
01:57:49.44 --> 01:57:54.08
there was no time to just stop and say we need to get everybody back together and talk about

1179
01:57:54.08 --> 01:57:58.88
what we're about to do tomorrow so you so you you already had the whole thing pre-art had the pre brief

1180
01:57:58.88 --> 01:58:03.68
that was there and then you go across the bridges what was the first indication that

1181
01:58:05.04 --> 01:58:10.16
oh it's on I the first indication it was on was even before we got that bridges

1182
01:58:10.16 --> 01:58:16.08
because all of a sudden that morning we found out and started hearing calls that there was an

1183
01:58:16.08 --> 01:58:22.24
army unit that had made its way into Nazarena and they had went up across one of the bridges that we

1184
01:58:22.24 --> 01:58:27.36
were supposed to on the southern bridge made it across the northern bridge all the way what's now

1185
01:58:27.36 --> 01:58:33.68
known as ambush alley US 507 maintenance was there and just managed to take a wrong turn

1186
01:58:33.68 --> 01:58:40.80
Captain Troy King got the unit on the northern side they kind of figured out we're off the path

1187
01:58:40.80 --> 01:58:46.000
up where we're at and figured at the time the best was to cut the shortest distance again

1188
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.32
to try to get back to where the convoy they had turned that they made that wrong turn

1189
01:58:51.36 --> 01:58:56.48
so the greatest thing was when we first started hearing that we've got army vehicles on fire

1190
01:58:56.48 --> 01:59:02.16
sitting in front here blood weapons laying all over the place and we are the north we're the

1191
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:08.000
spearhead the entire nobody's supposed to be in front of us so to hear over the radio what do you

1192
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.36
mean there's an army unit are they engaged or they not engage it's here no the first vehicle

1193
01:59:13.36 --> 01:59:18.32
start calling which are the tanks back and they're rolling past these burning vehicles and

1194
01:59:18.32 --> 01:59:23.68
there are fuel trucks and their convoy trucks it's not a combat convoy that was on there

1195
01:59:24.48 --> 01:59:29.28
and they're pushing and they're just relaying those positions that are back here so now

1196
01:59:29.28 --> 01:59:36.000
the generals, kernels everybody else is getting these fragmented stuff back here they're all trying

1197
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:43.12
to figure out what's going on and I get a call to go up and start figuring out what's going on up there

1198
01:59:43.12 --> 01:59:49.28
take another vehicle I grabbed another vehicle and started pushing as far as we could and at first

1199
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:56.000
I heard it's about a mile and a half somewhere up the road where the tanks had said they may have

1200
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.52
seen some soldiers on the side of the road we passed the burning vehicles that were there

1201
02:00:02.40 --> 02:00:08.56
all shot the pieces and then we just kind of kept driving up the road and saw nothing

1202
02:00:09.28 --> 02:00:14.72
and then I got up to the forward line where the M1 Abrams tanks and eighth tank battalion

1203
02:00:15.36 --> 02:00:20.72
and major bill people's was in charge of that and I drove the M track down into the side

1204
02:00:20.72 --> 02:00:28.48
set the driver over near the tank that tanks main guns are engaging T62s in the field everything

1205
02:00:28.48 --> 02:00:35.04
this is getting real main gun over pressure blasting you can't get a hold of them their mission

1206
02:00:35.04 --> 02:00:40.88
fix that's here got on the ground, climbed up the side of the tank got on the back of the gunner

1207
02:00:40.88 --> 02:00:47.28
staying and grabbed the gunner's helmet off the top which I believe kind of startled him a little

1208
02:00:47.28 --> 02:00:52.32
bit because they are actively engaging troops that are in the field and started to ask him

1209
02:00:52.88 --> 02:00:58.72
I mean he he looked and was like well do you come from I said did you see some soldiers

1210
02:00:58.72 --> 02:01:05.12
are up there and he said a little bit past the burning trucks and not far behind from where we're at

1211
02:01:05.12 --> 02:01:11.84
in between that area we saw some soldiers that may be a few hundred yards often areas and

1212
02:01:11.84 --> 02:01:19.60
then thank you very much my feet did not hit the deck he looked enough to see me start to climb

1213
02:01:19.60 --> 02:01:24.80
down the side of that tank to jump off and that's about this high that was here to get back to

1214
02:01:24.80 --> 02:01:31.68
the vehicle and when he saw me jump off the tank that main gun fired and was like the best roller

1215
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:36.48
coaster ride I've ever had in my life because the over pressure it's just like it arched your back

1216
02:01:36.48 --> 02:01:42.48
and I got back up I'm laughing he's laughing that's up the thumbs up run back to the thing tell

1217
02:01:42.48 --> 02:01:48.32
the drivers there's somewhere in here now we're in Indian country without here they're engaged in that

1218
02:01:48.32 --> 02:01:53.44
way we've now got artillery positions there I'm getting set up to start firing into the city

1219
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.96
and start doing the prep your start to see helicopters start to come into the into the air

1220
02:01:59.68 --> 02:02:05.84
and then we couldn't see any soldiers so we started we even the vehicles jacco back and forth

1221
02:02:05.84 --> 02:02:11.60
like you drive down some country road trying to find something in the ditch it was here with two

1222
02:02:11.60 --> 02:02:17.20
vehicles and eventually when I driver yelled and he said I see somebody over in the field and I looked

1223
02:02:17.20 --> 02:02:22.32
over there and it was a soldier waving her hands up and it was a chief warm officer that was in there

1224
02:02:22.88 --> 02:02:28.40
we pulled the vehicles over and saw to there and I tell people to this day okay because they've

1225
02:02:28.40 --> 02:02:34.64
caught a tremendous amount of heat for being the unit that was had people captured and

1226
02:02:34.64 --> 02:02:41.52
wandered into this or whatever else I get credit a lot for being the individuals that went out there

1227
02:02:41.52 --> 02:02:48.08
and saved the individuals and triage and this here for for that maintenance unit that was on the

1228
02:02:48.08 --> 02:02:55.04
ground when we got there and and put troops on the deck they did the best job that they could

1229
02:02:55.04 --> 02:03:02.16
possibly have done with trying to treat their own casualties one individual specialist we're

1230
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:06.80
about four gunshot wounds a big boy I think if it was me he wouldn't I wouldn't have lived

1231
02:03:06.80 --> 02:03:13.60
that the shots were his were at were arms upper arms legs and and I just remember him having this

1232
02:03:13.60 --> 02:03:19.52
calms and thing and when I stopped it we just looked up he said I never thought I'd be so happy to see

1233
02:03:19.52 --> 02:03:25.52
him or any of my life and we said we're gonna take care of you and we started ripping t-shirts

1234
02:03:25.52 --> 02:03:33.28
manages corpsmen were there they had made like a little 360 degree perimeter specialist Miller was

1235
02:03:33.28 --> 02:03:37.92
awarded the silver star out of that unit for defending those commanders that were here out of that

1236
02:03:37.92 --> 02:03:42.88
maintenance unit so this whole kind of stick that they get that they didn't fight they didn't do this they

1237
02:03:42.88 --> 02:03:48.72
were just a maintenance unit that wandered in they're turning kicked in they did the initial things

1238
02:03:48.72 --> 02:03:53.76
that were out there sent the other group over to the other little wagon wheel that they had

1239
02:03:53.76 --> 02:03:58.000
another individual set up into there and I can just remember looking at grubbing thinking the

1240
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:05.52
calmest here's this guy he's just boy he's on point thank you for showing up saving he's not how

1241
02:04:05.52 --> 02:04:10.72
one he's not screaming and then we have one of the other ones it's missing part of the back of his

1242
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:16.80
foot that's over there we get them in we get back down south tanks are still engaging and push a

1243
02:04:16.80 --> 02:04:23.60
north we get enough time to just kick them out of the vehicles jaco at the first like ambulance

1244
02:04:23.60 --> 02:04:28.48
I could find because at this time no there's no aid stations set up there's nothing so you get

1245
02:04:28.48 --> 02:04:34.32
them back there drop them because I got a I got a convoy to get back up here and instantly we

1246
02:04:34.32 --> 02:04:39.44
drop them right there fell back into the battle line and started moving in on those bridges

1247
02:04:39.44 --> 02:04:45.52
in an azurea and the first bridge we hit was a rail bridge and the first thing that I heard

1248
02:04:45.52 --> 02:04:51.76
net was that there was a van coming and there was an RPG gunner hanging out to sign the van

1249
02:04:51.76 --> 02:05:00.24
and we saw the first shot and yelled sanger sanger which was the cue to the armor vehicles

1250
02:05:00.24 --> 02:05:07.12
to start driving it radically to try to evade a rocket attack um now go when they did that I knew

1251
02:05:07.12 --> 02:05:13.60
everything was gonna be okay I did because instant willingness in that confusion and they're hearing

1252
02:05:13.60 --> 02:05:18.72
all this chaos going on their helmet and their listening still for the key words and the reaction

1253
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:23.36
to everything they're not going where's that coming from right they just start doing what they're

1254
02:05:23.36 --> 02:05:29.60
trained to do that short amount of time move across that rail head nothing sitting move over the

1255
02:05:29.60 --> 02:05:36.40
southern bridge and it was eerily quiet moving over the southern bridge of the uffredi's river

1256
02:05:36.96 --> 02:05:43.68
was eerily like nothing was going on it's I don't know if you tuned it out in the city but it was

1257
02:05:43.68 --> 02:05:49.60
like there was no firing going on it was eerily quiet moving into there and then I was sitting

1258
02:05:49.60 --> 02:05:55.44
on top in the center of that bridge and the forward part now I'm the last vehicle so there's

1259
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.32
about 13 other AVs they're staggered in front of me and about eight seconds into that feeling the

1260
02:06:02.32 --> 02:06:11.84
entire world exploded rockets mortars coordinated RPK machine gun fire on corners of the bridges

1261
02:06:11.84 --> 02:06:17.04
and everything here I'm yelling over the thing to the first section later it's the first vehicle

1262
02:06:17.04 --> 02:06:22.72
at the bottom you need to push and get us off of this bridge it's down here we get down and off

1263
02:06:22.72 --> 02:06:27.92
the other side of that bridge and those vehicles start moving into these harrying bone battle positions

1264
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:34.56
and now they need to drop their infantry because we are on our objective we still have other units

1265
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:39.84
that have to pass through this objective to get to their objective that are up there and using

1266
02:06:39.84 --> 02:06:46.16
situational awareness in the moon field I still to this day can't remember seeing another armored

1267
02:06:46.16 --> 02:06:52.64
column roll feet away through there because you're so focused on what you're doing in that area

1268
02:06:53.36 --> 02:06:58.88
and now they're calling out RPG gunners they're calling out mortarmen on the top you're seeing

1269
02:06:58.88 --> 02:07:05.44
the RPGs flip and hit in the road some of them are duds some of them aren't duds and then

1270
02:07:05.44 --> 02:07:11.12
you'd have to disembark the infantry the infantry gets out there and this is like something

1271
02:07:11.12 --> 02:07:17.28
that was I I could only imagine this is what custer felt like when you're got a 360 degree

1272
02:07:17.28 --> 02:07:23.36
and it's coming from everywhere and you can't figure out what the main part of this whether it's

1273
02:07:23.36 --> 02:07:28.08
artillery that's coming in on you whether it's forward observers there were people watching the

1274
02:07:28.08 --> 02:07:32.96
battle and I go that we're just sitting up there drinking tea with their family on these varandas

1275
02:07:32.96 --> 02:07:38.16
that are just watching and you're sitting here going is that a spotter is that somebody I mean the

1276
02:07:38.16 --> 02:07:43.20
guy looks like he's 70 but I don't know right now and a lot of guys are then asking you

1277
02:07:45.04 --> 02:07:50.32
are we authorized to return fire to do this because that was probably the biggest thing that happened

1278
02:07:50.32 --> 02:07:56.40
in Nazarea was that epic scope and scale of it you would think that people were itch in the

1279
02:07:56.40 --> 02:08:02.88
pool the trigger it was quite the opposite they were really running the rules of engagement and saying

1280
02:08:02.88 --> 02:08:06.88
until I get some real positive idea or something like this I'm not just going to sling a 50 count

1281
02:08:06.88 --> 02:08:13.04
into this building until I have a reason to do that and it was a really short time until we

1282
02:08:13.04 --> 02:08:17.76
are given a reason to do all of that and more whether it's 40 millimeter of our native launchers

1283
02:08:17.76 --> 02:08:24.88
50 cows laying 60 millimeter mortars on direct fire down avenues of approach it was

1284
02:08:24.88 --> 02:08:32.16
every range you had ever been on all packed into one that was there and it was that way

1285
02:08:32.16 --> 02:08:38.72
for a solid straight eight hours and nothing let up there wasn't a breather there wasn't anything

1286
02:08:38.72 --> 02:08:44.000
it was in here the supply chains aren't going to come up to you because they know what's going

1287
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:51.20
on up there so at the times this is all happening the tanks are a pretty big signature all

1288
02:08:51.20 --> 02:08:56.40
the sudden tanks run out of gas really quick when they're burning through that noise tanks start

1289
02:08:56.40 --> 02:09:00.48
pulling out the bottle position because you can't get the fuel in to refuel the tanks are in the

1290
02:09:00.48 --> 02:09:06.32
city tanks are now going to leave the city so if you want to go down in your stomach

1291
02:09:06.32 --> 02:09:11.44
is when you see those bad boys start rolling the opposite way and you're left with thin skin

1292
02:09:11.44 --> 02:09:18.48
vehicles because our amtrax on that deployment cycle we didn't have enough time when we got

1293
02:09:18.48 --> 02:09:23.92
the deployment order jacco to get the bolt on armor to put on the outside of vehicles so our

1294
02:09:23.92 --> 02:09:30.000
vehicles at the thickest point was two inches of aluminum we didn't have the applique we didn't have

1295
02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:36.64
the enhanced armor it was in there and then the humvies still just had cloth doors and they had

1296
02:09:36.64 --> 02:09:42.24
that that ghetto armor as we called it in 2004 and five and armor plates and all that were the

1297
02:09:42.24 --> 02:09:49.76
product of what we learned back then to do that and as they're going the tanks go that way and now

1298
02:09:50.80 --> 02:09:59.36
the fight is in a 360 and we're about an hour and a half into that don't know what's going on

1299
02:09:59.36 --> 02:10:03.76
if the other northern bridge don't know what's going on on the outskirts of town where our third

1300
02:10:03.76 --> 02:10:09.28
maneuver unit was supposed to be on the outskirts of town and that had the commander in the third

1301
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:14.48
maneuver unit on the outskirts of Nazarelia they kind of tried to do an end around with these command

1302
02:10:14.48 --> 02:10:22.40
vehicles and they got into this Iraqi cesspool bog that was no no it's a shit dump it was a

1303
02:10:23.28 --> 02:10:29.12
and an armored vehicle it looks like it's sand on top first one launches into there sinks all the

1304
02:10:29.12 --> 02:10:34.72
way down it can't get out and one Abrams goes in after it it's gone command vehicles go in it's

1305
02:10:34.72 --> 02:10:39.92
going and you're talking about now we're thermite engine compartments and everything because we're

1306
02:10:39.92 --> 02:10:44.80
going to have to leave these vehicles inside of these cities this is the blueprint that wasn't supposed to

1307
02:10:44.80 --> 02:10:51.20
happen or this is what how many hours into it are you right now this is two this is two

1308
02:10:52.16 --> 02:10:58.72
end to that are you have you already taken casualties at this point at that point none in

1309
02:10:58.72 --> 02:11:07.76
mining media area and then right after that is when I was faced in opposite direction fire an

1310
02:11:07.76 --> 02:11:17.28
turret in kind of a rearward thing to keep the Iraqis back from this avenue of approach and we saw

1311
02:11:17.28 --> 02:11:22.96
an ambulance coming into a high rate of speed up the thing and I can remember what the sea was on the

1312
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:28.96
side and all this and myself and another vehicle alpha 311 was sitting on each side of the

1313
02:11:28.96 --> 02:11:35.76
spread and this thing just kept coming kept coming close into distance 200 meters and I kept

1314
02:11:35.76 --> 02:11:40.48
telling them just calling out call it out we did you're usually not supposed to do a burst

1315
02:11:40.48 --> 02:11:46.88
of warning fire to do that but this is the first stages of I'm bad and this is kind of an ambulance

1316
02:11:48.08 --> 02:11:52.40
it's also with the same time kind of a v-bit it's coming this way because some of us did remember

1317
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:59.12
Bay Route a few things that were like that when we were younger um so it gets about 75 meters

1318
02:12:00.40 --> 02:12:06.000
game on and we lit into that thing and that vehicle cleaned off and stopped and pounded into a wall

1319
02:12:06.56 --> 02:12:13.36
the whole camp lit red that was on that and Susan smacked in that wall that back hatch opened up

1320
02:12:13.36 --> 02:12:18.80
and six black clad Iraqi fed ahead fully armed with the teeth fighters came out of that back

1321
02:12:18.80 --> 02:12:23.92
and that vehicle and started running across the street and there you know now it's

1322
02:12:24.96 --> 02:12:29.84
I got another gonna use ambulance it's now they're gonna do this now you're really into this and

1323
02:12:29.84 --> 02:12:34.80
it's all in that two hour window right and then you're talking about rules and engagement rules

1324
02:12:34.80 --> 02:12:40.40
not am engagement you're an 18 year old kid that's out here is gunnery sardin do I am I authorize a

1325
02:12:40.40 --> 02:12:44.88
shoot something like that or am I gonna be charged with some kind of um it's after here

1326
02:12:44.88 --> 02:12:52.16
hey man this is what we have to do with this time to keep the family alive um and when they

1327
02:12:52.16 --> 02:12:58.40
dropped out with weapons it was just like that every avenue will approach you would see a mass

1328
02:12:58.96 --> 02:13:05.04
you would look up on verandas you would see people come out and fire rockets down the road

1329
02:13:05.04 --> 02:13:10.000
to try to skip them into tanks and then you'd see them disappear and then a few seconds later

1330
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.52
you'd see somebody come out on a top-brand again kind of put their head around about 20 seconds later

1331
02:13:15.52 --> 02:13:20.80
that person will cut now that person's a spotter for the person it's undery and you just got to

1332
02:13:20.80 --> 02:13:28.24
watch the marines calculate all that at the rapid rate and start to deduce this is what's happening

1333
02:13:28.88 --> 02:13:34.56
can I do this can I not do this here's what I'm gonna do and then my driver yells

1334
02:13:34.56 --> 02:13:42.000
hey bonnes look at these dumbass going the wrong way and it was kind of this little

1335
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.76
Georgian kid 19 years old loved him a death pfc sasser he's looking right at the road

1336
02:13:48.32 --> 02:13:55.52
and what he saw was an amtrak going the opposite direction and the first thing I can remember

1337
02:13:55.52 --> 02:14:01.60
think in jacca was don't let that be one-a-mind because I didn't tell any end to go that way to do that

1338
02:14:01.60 --> 02:14:12.56
and then when the clarity happens you look and the RPG gunner at the top materializes 50 feet above

1339
02:14:12.56 --> 02:14:19.28
that amtrak he fires a rocket down into the top of that amtrak and then it blows the back

1340
02:14:19.28 --> 02:14:25.04
into the amtrak open and then you see and a raki rpg gunner walk right out in the middle of the street

1341
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:30.48
take a knee and fire the second rocket right into the street true compartment which is a completely

1342
02:14:30.48 --> 02:14:37.20
coordinated effort of attack these aren't just a bunch of insurgents that are there and then you see

1343
02:14:37.20 --> 02:14:42.40
that blue open next thing you see is a US Marine fallout on fire and I could tell it was one of

1344
02:14:42.40 --> 02:14:48.56
ours he still had his communications cord and helmet attached in the back of that and it's all surreal

1345
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:52.96
at that time you don't have sights and sounds you don't have it it just kind of

1346
02:14:52.96 --> 02:14:59.68
shhhhhshhhhhshhhh and you're in this vacuum watching all this happen and the vehicle comes to a

1347
02:14:59.68 --> 02:15:05.76
rolling stop on its own power because you can see smoke coming out every hatch it's on fire

1348
02:15:05.76 --> 02:15:12.32
and then you can see troops laying in the answers and I can just remember the infantry is engaged

1349
02:15:12.32 --> 02:15:18.64
but I can just remember that nobody's kind of running near that thing right now so I yelled in the back

1350
02:15:18.64 --> 02:15:23.14
to my doc, grab your unit one kit and come with me.

1351
02:15:23.14 --> 02:15:26.78
And Alex the last guest from Poet Thoreco.

1352
02:15:28.06 --> 02:15:29.38
Great little kid.

1353
02:15:29.38 --> 02:15:32.12
First time in combat, he grabs his stuff,

1354
02:15:32.12 --> 02:15:34.96
he runs out the back, I got no helmet,

1355
02:15:34.96 --> 02:15:37.82
I got it because you're throwing everything off, right?

1356
02:15:37.82 --> 02:15:40.54
And we get out there, we run to the vehicle.

1357
02:15:40.54 --> 02:15:43.14
And the first thing I see is have to like of a Marine,

1358
02:15:43.14 --> 02:15:45.06
laying down the vehicle.

1359
02:15:45.06 --> 02:15:46.46
And I remember picking it up,

1360
02:15:46.46 --> 02:15:48.74
there's nothing else to do, and you're like,

1361
02:15:48.74 --> 02:15:50.26
doc lay this off to the side,

1362
02:15:50.26 --> 02:15:52.54
because maybe there's people here alive,

1363
02:15:52.54 --> 02:15:54.30
you know, in your own way, you're trying to think,

1364
02:15:54.30 --> 02:15:56.70
maybe this can be reattached or doing that.

1365
02:15:56.70 --> 02:15:58.74
And I still remember the picture I had

1366
02:15:58.74 --> 02:16:01.34
of him standing there holding this leg,

1367
02:16:01.34 --> 02:16:02.78
and he put it in the leg combat,

1368
02:16:02.78 --> 02:16:06.06
trauma of a Marine, and this look on his face like,

1369
02:16:06.06 --> 02:16:09.22
oh my God, what's going on?

1370
02:16:09.22 --> 02:16:11.90
And then we went into the back of the vehicle.

1371
02:16:11.90 --> 02:16:12.90
The back of the vehicle,

1372
02:16:12.90 --> 02:16:17.34
Jogga was completely collapsed in, and this a 2016 vehicle.

1373
02:16:17.34 --> 02:16:19.86
So the top of these cargo hatches,

1374
02:16:19.86 --> 02:16:22.82
they need a few Marines on a good date to open them up,

1375
02:16:22.82 --> 02:16:26.54
and these are imploded into the back of the vehicle.

1376
02:16:26.54 --> 02:16:29.50
And then yet, the remember inside of the vehicle,

1377
02:16:29.50 --> 02:16:34.10
you have no shortage of about 1,000 Mark 19 grenades,

1378
02:16:34.10 --> 02:16:37.02
you have boxes of hand grenades, the infantry,

1379
02:16:37.02 --> 02:16:40.66
you couldn't sit in the back of a US combat vehicle,

1380
02:16:40.66 --> 02:16:44.70
going into combat in 2003, and actually put your feet

1381
02:16:44.70 --> 02:16:47.14
on the actual deck of a vehicle,

1382
02:16:47.14 --> 02:16:48.98
because there was a sub deck,

1383
02:16:48.98 --> 02:16:51.62
and the upper deck was all the ammunition

1384
02:16:51.62 --> 02:16:53.10
that was laid across there.

1385
02:16:53.10 --> 02:16:57.34
So not only are these infantrymen on a regular day,

1386
02:16:57.34 --> 02:16:59.94
packed in like you and I talked about before,

1387
02:16:59.94 --> 02:17:02.06
now their knees are to their chest,

1388
02:17:02.06 --> 02:17:04.42
they're sitting on top of a powder keg,

1389
02:17:04.42 --> 02:17:09.26
and it should just nothing but cordite and pitch black.

1390
02:17:09.26 --> 02:17:11.86
And you can't see and you start feeling,

1391
02:17:11.86 --> 02:17:16.86
and I just start walking through Jaguar from Marine to Marine,

1392
02:17:18.46 --> 02:17:21.38
and I would see a Marine and I'd move up

1393
02:17:21.38 --> 02:17:24.34
and try to feel, check for a pulse, whatever,

1394
02:17:24.34 --> 02:17:26.90
because they're just all mixed in together.

1395
02:17:26.90 --> 02:17:29.46
These cargo hatches had also imploded

1396
02:17:29.46 --> 02:17:31.62
and bent them all when they all shape positions,

1397
02:17:31.62 --> 02:17:33.82
when they collapsed on their backs.

1398
02:17:33.82 --> 02:17:35.78
So even if you have the average Marine,

1399
02:17:35.78 --> 02:17:39.22
let's just say a buck 80 that is out there.

1400
02:17:39.22 --> 02:17:42.78
You had another 60 pounds of kit on top of that kit,

1401
02:17:42.78 --> 02:17:46.02
and all of his weapons and everything else,

1402
02:17:46.02 --> 02:17:47.66
it's a mess.

1403
02:17:47.66 --> 02:17:49.74
And as we're moving through there,

1404
02:17:49.74 --> 02:17:52.06
I'm gonna look back and tell one doc,

1405
02:17:52.06 --> 02:17:54.02
he's triaging people,

1406
02:17:54.02 --> 02:17:56.66
and I could look back and doc was feeling for a pulse,

1407
02:17:56.66 --> 02:17:58.54
and I would tell doc, forget it,

1408
02:17:59.66 --> 02:18:01.82
go to the next one he's dead,

1409
02:18:01.82 --> 02:18:04.06
because doc couldn't see the side of his head

1410
02:18:04.06 --> 02:18:05.94
it was missing that I could see.

1411
02:18:05.94 --> 02:18:09.34
He could only see the other side when he came through.

1412
02:18:09.34 --> 02:18:12.06
And now I figure Jaguar everybody's dead.

1413
02:18:12.06 --> 02:18:14.22
There's not a single living person that's inside.

1414
02:18:14.22 --> 02:18:15.66
Here they could have survived this.

1415
02:18:17.42 --> 02:18:21.74
Then you just start hearing all the stuff

1416
02:18:21.74 --> 02:18:24.46
ricocheting off the outside of the vehicle.

1417
02:18:24.46 --> 02:18:27.50
You still see the rocket trails that are flying behind

1418
02:18:27.50 --> 02:18:30.14
because now this is a large target right in the middle

1419
02:18:30.14 --> 02:18:31.62
of the magnet.

1420
02:18:31.62 --> 02:18:32.46
To magnet.

1421
02:18:32.46 --> 02:18:35.26
And they're aiming everything they can for it.

1422
02:18:35.26 --> 02:18:38.14
And I just figured first of all,

1423
02:18:38.14 --> 02:18:40.10
we need to get as much weapons as we can.

1424
02:18:40.10 --> 02:18:41.86
We need to zero the radio's out.

1425
02:18:41.86 --> 02:18:43.66
We need to get the crypto out of here.

1426
02:18:43.66 --> 02:18:46.74
We need to do that and start it to go up,

1427
02:18:46.74 --> 02:18:50.70
because I figured I was asking for a thermite grenade,

1428
02:18:50.70 --> 02:18:52.70
because if I couldn't get the radio's out or whatever,

1429
02:18:52.70 --> 02:18:54.70
you can drop a thermite and burn them.

1430
02:18:54.70 --> 02:18:55.70
And this is what we're gonna do

1431
02:18:55.70 --> 02:18:58.30
because we may have to leave this here.

1432
02:18:59.30 --> 02:19:00.78
Which is one of the saddest things,

1433
02:19:00.78 --> 02:19:02.70
you don't leave a dead moon to come right behind,

1434
02:19:02.70 --> 02:19:04.18
but in the middle of the fight,

1435
02:19:04.18 --> 02:19:06.10
you have to do what you do to survive.

1436
02:19:06.10 --> 02:19:08.98
And also, get the materials you have to do

1437
02:19:08.98 --> 02:19:11.34
to carry the fight to the enemy.

1438
02:19:11.34 --> 02:19:13.26
And you cannot quit,

1439
02:19:13.26 --> 02:19:16.22
because even if your tired cold wet and hungry,

1440
02:19:16.22 --> 02:19:18.42
somebody else is more tired cold wet and hungry.

1441
02:19:18.42 --> 02:19:22.18
Anything else you, you're talking 136 degrees

1442
02:19:22.18 --> 02:19:23.98
or anything else.

1443
02:19:23.98 --> 02:19:26.06
We're already in the fight where Marines have already sucked

1444
02:19:26.06 --> 02:19:27.74
through all their canteen to water

1445
02:19:27.74 --> 02:19:29.50
or their camel backs to do that.

1446
02:19:29.50 --> 02:19:31.62
The water's hot already, as you know,

1447
02:19:31.62 --> 02:19:36.14
it's not chilled water in their in it.

1448
02:19:36.14 --> 02:19:39.42
And I stepped into the middle of that

1449
02:19:39.42 --> 02:19:41.86
and dropped down on my right knee,

1450
02:19:41.86 --> 02:19:45.58
trying to get through, and I heard a man gas for air.

1451
02:19:47.10 --> 02:19:49.58
It was who I was stepping on that was here.

1452
02:19:49.58 --> 02:19:51.22
And it turned out to be a corporal

1453
02:19:51.22 --> 02:19:53.42
by the name of Matthew Jessica.

1454
02:19:53.42 --> 02:19:56.54
And that was a vehicle, and a Marine,

1455
02:19:56.54 --> 02:19:59.02
it was in a completely different unit.

1456
02:19:59.02 --> 02:20:01.78
They were charged with taking the northern bridge

1457
02:20:01.78 --> 02:20:03.78
or we had this southern bridge.

1458
02:20:03.78 --> 02:20:06.74
So now in your head, how did they get here?

1459
02:20:06.74 --> 02:20:09.58
How are they back down here to do this?

1460
02:20:09.58 --> 02:20:12.42
And you find out what had happened

1461
02:20:12.42 --> 02:20:15.90
at the northern bridge, when they got along that northern bridge,

1462
02:20:15.90 --> 02:20:18.14
they were hit with Iraqi artillery fire.

1463
02:20:18.14 --> 02:20:19.10
They were hit without.

1464
02:20:19.10 --> 02:20:20.38
And then they were also the unit

1465
02:20:20.38 --> 02:20:23.74
that were hit by the eight-end streets

1466
02:20:23.74 --> 02:20:27.06
that were up there and had all this madness going on at one time.

1467
02:20:27.06 --> 02:20:30.70
These vehicles that were now seeing coming back in,

1468
02:20:30.70 --> 02:20:32.54
they were the vehicles that were loaded with casualties

1469
02:20:32.54 --> 02:20:35.18
trying to get back south of the city

1470
02:20:35.18 --> 02:20:37.50
to do what we had done with the 507.

1471
02:20:37.50 --> 02:20:40.02
And then the Iraqis were picking them off

1472
02:20:40.02 --> 02:20:44.34
just like they did the 507 when they came back into the city.

1473
02:20:44.34 --> 02:20:49.10
Deep reef the A10, friendly fire situation that unfold

1474
02:20:49.10 --> 02:20:51.78
that is from what you, from what you know about it.

1475
02:20:51.78 --> 02:20:54.22
Well, when it was actually happened in Jaguar,

1476
02:20:54.22 --> 02:20:55.54
it was southern bridge.

1477
02:20:55.54 --> 02:20:58.82
So it's pretty distinctive when you can hear an A10.

1478
02:20:58.82 --> 02:21:02.38
Come over and it makes a pretty distinctive sound,

1479
02:21:02.38 --> 02:21:03.58
as well when those can't enter.

1480
02:21:03.58 --> 02:21:06.22
Actually we go in all of a sudden, you know there in the area.

1481
02:21:06.22 --> 02:21:08.14
Now the northern bridge in that where it's happening

1482
02:21:08.14 --> 02:21:12.06
is probably about another, when I have two miles up ambush alley.

1483
02:21:12.06 --> 02:21:17.06
And what we can assess is there were actually survivors

1484
02:21:18.46 --> 02:21:21.34
in that track that I was in that were also crew members

1485
02:21:21.34 --> 02:21:22.58
that were in the front.

1486
02:21:22.58 --> 02:21:26.66
So I was able to garner after we coherently

1487
02:21:26.66 --> 02:21:28.66
were able to get some people to talk.

1488
02:21:28.66 --> 02:21:30.82
Wasn't the casualty I pull out of the back

1489
02:21:30.82 --> 02:21:33.62
and it really wasn't the two guys that were inside.

1490
02:21:33.62 --> 02:21:34.90
That was there.

1491
02:21:34.90 --> 02:21:39.34
Another Amtrak had called out and said a second vehicle

1492
02:21:39.34 --> 02:21:42.86
was here and they're trying to get us to come help them

1493
02:21:42.86 --> 02:21:44.54
up at the northern bridge.

1494
02:21:45.98 --> 02:21:49.66
And he was saying what was happening at the northern bridge.

1495
02:21:49.66 --> 02:21:53.06
And the open source that you can find,

1496
02:21:53.06 --> 02:21:57.34
they redacted after action, it's online that was here,

1497
02:21:57.34 --> 02:22:01.42
was basically what had been happening was when they got

1498
02:22:01.42 --> 02:22:03.58
forward to the northern bridge and they were hit

1499
02:22:03.58 --> 02:22:05.62
with this multiple things that are calling air strikes

1500
02:22:05.62 --> 02:22:06.94
that were coming in.

1501
02:22:06.94 --> 02:22:11.26
The forward air controller was the fact

1502
02:22:11.26 --> 02:22:14.54
that was supposed to actually be having eyes on the target.

1503
02:22:14.54 --> 02:22:18.46
And the fact did not have eyes on the target.

1504
02:22:18.46 --> 02:22:22.78
It was at that position and he was co-located in the

1505
02:22:22.78 --> 02:22:26.06
with the command element that was back in the city.

1506
02:22:26.06 --> 02:22:30.58
And when the ATANs are coming in,

1507
02:22:30.58 --> 02:22:34.70
the ATANs are getting grids that there are no USB

1508
02:22:34.70 --> 02:22:36.70
equals forward of a certain position.

1509
02:22:36.70 --> 02:22:39.42
Kind of like when we got to call for the army,

1510
02:22:39.42 --> 02:22:41.66
what do you mean the army's up there to do that.

1511
02:22:41.66 --> 02:22:44.06
And then they're getting confusing calls

1512
02:22:44.06 --> 02:22:47.70
of vehicles are coming back in to the city,

1513
02:22:47.70 --> 02:22:50.62
which I am assuming at that, if I'm a pilot or anything else,

1514
02:22:50.62 --> 02:22:53.26
and I'm seeing armor vehicles coming back into a city,

1515
02:22:53.26 --> 02:22:56.98
it may be enemy reinforcements, it may be something like that.

1516
02:22:56.98 --> 02:22:59.22
But at one period, whatever it was,

1517
02:22:59.22 --> 02:23:02.14
Jack, or they were given the clearance to fire.

1518
02:23:02.14 --> 02:23:05.70
Fire on the vehicles that were north of that city.

1519
02:23:05.70 --> 02:23:08.58
And when they came in, call signs were,

1520
02:23:08.58 --> 02:23:11.82
were jirate that is on there and they came in.

1521
02:23:11.82 --> 02:23:14.54
I made their first run and their first strafing run.

1522
02:23:14.54 --> 02:23:16.94
They made a couple of those.

1523
02:23:16.94 --> 02:23:20.54
And then they flew back off up to the level in the stack

1524
02:23:20.54 --> 02:23:23.34
to start coming back around and to do that again.

1525
02:23:23.34 --> 02:23:26.18
And they made multiple runs on those vehicles.

1526
02:23:26.18 --> 02:23:27.54
They were up there.

1527
02:23:27.54 --> 02:23:30.06
So the vehicles that you can see online,

1528
02:23:30.06 --> 02:23:31.34
the vehicles that you could see there,

1529
02:23:31.34 --> 02:23:33.18
the ones that look like they're completely gutted

1530
02:23:33.18 --> 02:23:35.06
and split open like a can opener,

1531
02:23:35.06 --> 02:23:38.86
that shows all the aluminum melted,

1532
02:23:38.86 --> 02:23:43.22
the outside of the things, that was from Iraqi small arms fire,

1533
02:23:43.22 --> 02:23:44.62
or anything else it was like that.

1534
02:23:44.62 --> 02:23:48.58
That was the Marines that were in the mass confusion

1535
02:23:48.58 --> 02:23:50.02
at the northern portion of the bridge,

1536
02:23:50.02 --> 02:23:54.06
holding their battle position was trying to figure out

1537
02:23:54.06 --> 02:23:56.62
where this enemy fire is coming from,

1538
02:23:56.62 --> 02:24:00.18
calling in the air to out what that enemy fire.

1539
02:24:00.18 --> 02:24:02.22
And then that enemy fire in the middle of the fracture

1540
02:24:02.22 --> 02:24:06.42
sign incident happens to frag Marines

1541
02:24:06.42 --> 02:24:08.86
that are in that mass confusion.

1542
02:24:11.02 --> 02:24:13.38
You know what was later because they fired

1543
02:24:13.38 --> 02:24:14.70
the plate of uranium rounds.

1544
02:24:14.70 --> 02:24:17.78
And when you see the aftermath of all these nickels

1545
02:24:17.78 --> 02:24:19.38
and the plate of uranium rounds,

1546
02:24:19.38 --> 02:24:21.42
they leave a nice little melted,

1547
02:24:21.42 --> 02:24:23.02
looks like the Terminator.

1548
02:24:23.02 --> 02:24:25.54
Like when the Terminator shot and they had,

1549
02:24:25.54 --> 02:24:28.06
you see the bullet hole go through Arnold Schwarzenegger's head

1550
02:24:28.06 --> 02:24:29.38
and then you see the metal go back,

1551
02:24:29.38 --> 02:24:31.70
it just kind of peels out, it's like that.

1552
02:24:31.70 --> 02:24:33.54
And you can see these cavernous things

1553
02:24:33.54 --> 02:24:35.86
that are inside of there to do that.

1554
02:24:35.86 --> 02:24:38.10
But at the same time that you're down at the south,

1555
02:24:38.10 --> 02:24:41.02
you don't know Jack or that's going on.

1556
02:24:41.02 --> 02:24:45.86
You only find out with the luxury of history now,

1557
02:24:45.86 --> 02:24:49.50
but you also knew by the time it was about five or six

1558
02:24:49.50 --> 02:24:53.26
to clock when you were able to get up to that northern bridge,

1559
02:24:53.26 --> 02:24:55.98
you instantly were getting the feedback

1560
02:24:55.98 --> 02:24:58.94
from the troops on the ground on what happened here

1561
02:24:58.94 --> 02:25:02.54
and seeing their homes are gone.

1562
02:25:03.54 --> 02:25:04.82
Some of them are their gearists

1563
02:25:04.82 --> 02:25:06.46
and one of those vehicles that are there,

1564
02:25:06.46 --> 02:25:08.42
they only have the ammunition that's on their back.

1565
02:25:08.42 --> 02:25:09.30
They don't know,

1566
02:25:09.30 --> 02:25:10.30
either can survive.

1567
02:25:10.30 --> 02:25:11.90
They got each other to top there

1568
02:25:11.90 --> 02:25:13.50
and there are no battle position

1569
02:25:13.50 --> 02:25:15.70
and they're defending and holding their perimeter.

1570
02:25:16.78 --> 02:25:19.02
And then back in the city,

1571
02:25:19.02 --> 02:25:22.34
we are now still trying to figure out

1572
02:25:22.34 --> 02:25:24.82
what is going on with these vehicles.

1573
02:25:26.98 --> 02:25:29.82
We find this individual and we get him in the vehicle

1574
02:25:29.82 --> 02:25:33.42
and we have him taken back over to the back end of an Amtron.

1575
02:25:33.42 --> 02:25:35.82
And when I say this individual marine,

1576
02:25:35.82 --> 02:25:38.30
this individual marine was the largest marine

1577
02:25:38.30 --> 02:25:39.90
that was in that company.

1578
02:25:39.90 --> 02:25:42.18
He was 240 plus pounds.

1579
02:25:42.18 --> 02:25:44.66
He was about six foot five

1580
02:25:44.66 --> 02:25:46.98
and overall with all of his gear weight well

1581
02:25:46.98 --> 02:25:49.26
over 300 some pounds.

1582
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:53.30
And you know, it's a time pushing a buck 60.

1583
02:25:53.30 --> 02:25:55.70
Doc is pushing even less than that

1584
02:25:55.70 --> 02:25:58.10
and we're in the back trying to dislodge

1585
02:25:58.10 --> 02:26:00.06
a 300 plus pound individual.

1586
02:26:00.06 --> 02:26:03.66
Let's end the back of this with all this equipment mixed in.

1587
02:26:03.66 --> 02:26:05.94
And I can see when he's bent in the all-shaped position,

1588
02:26:05.94 --> 02:26:09.98
I go, his head is split in the base of his neck all the way

1589
02:26:09.98 --> 02:26:12.74
to the top where you can see his entire cranium.

1590
02:26:12.74 --> 02:26:13.58
Do we set?

1591
02:26:15.38 --> 02:26:19.06
So what I did was we offer some more marines.

1592
02:26:19.06 --> 02:26:20.46
We kind of made a daisy chain.

1593
02:26:20.46 --> 02:26:23.02
I held on to him as much we could.

1594
02:26:23.02 --> 02:26:25.70
The company first sergeant came in, got some more marines

1595
02:26:25.70 --> 02:26:27.22
doc held on to me.

1596
02:26:27.22 --> 02:26:29.82
We started cutting as much equipment as we could

1597
02:26:29.82 --> 02:26:33.22
and started daisy chain and this big boy out of the back

1598
02:26:33.22 --> 02:26:35.50
of that because you had to make a decision

1599
02:26:35.50 --> 02:26:39.78
at the time, if I leave him or he's dead,

1600
02:26:39.78 --> 02:26:41.54
if I move him, he's dead.

1601
02:26:41.54 --> 02:26:43.46
In my head, that's what I'm thinking

1602
02:26:43.46 --> 02:26:47.46
because I see the trauma that he has on him.

1603
02:26:47.46 --> 02:26:50.18
And I know the type of injuries in these places

1604
02:26:50.18 --> 02:26:52.58
we're talking about spinal injuries, we're talking about head

1605
02:26:52.58 --> 02:26:53.74
injuries.

1606
02:26:53.74 --> 02:26:55.94
And you don't have the means with the rockets

1607
02:26:55.94 --> 02:26:59.26
and everything else to stabilize spine boards and all this.

1608
02:26:59.26 --> 02:27:00.50
So you had to make a decision.

1609
02:27:00.50 --> 02:27:03.30
And I'm making him out.

1610
02:27:03.30 --> 02:27:05.10
And the decision was made at that time.

1611
02:27:05.10 --> 02:27:06.42
I'd much rather if it was made,

1612
02:27:06.42 --> 02:27:08.82
somebody yank my ass out of here to work

1613
02:27:08.82 --> 02:27:10.50
and get back to some medical treatment.

1614
02:27:10.50 --> 02:27:14.54
And doc and I and the Marine ran him across the intersection

1615
02:27:14.54 --> 02:27:18.02
on her fire, placed him into a back of another vehicle

1616
02:27:18.02 --> 02:27:21.42
or doc started to treat his head injury.

1617
02:27:21.42 --> 02:27:24.58
And then I had ran back out in the street

1618
02:27:24.58 --> 02:27:26.74
to tell him there's more.

1619
02:27:26.74 --> 02:27:29.42
So I went back to the vehicle again.

1620
02:27:29.42 --> 02:27:30.54
Still I have to do the weapons.

1621
02:27:30.54 --> 02:27:33.22
Still I have to do everything else to inside of vehicle.

1622
02:27:33.22 --> 02:27:36.02
And then I also hear that somebody had moved some casualties

1623
02:27:36.02 --> 02:27:38.82
to a house right across the street.

1624
02:27:38.82 --> 02:27:40.94
And some marine machine gunners were going

1625
02:27:40.94 --> 02:27:41.94
and they kept pointing.

1626
02:27:41.94 --> 02:27:42.94
I think they're down that way.

1627
02:27:42.94 --> 02:27:44.70
And I went into this house, Jago.

1628
02:27:44.70 --> 02:27:47.14
I don't have a weapon on me.

1629
02:27:47.14 --> 02:27:49.02
That's here.

1630
02:27:49.02 --> 02:27:51.42
I do have a nine mill that's on that.

1631
02:27:51.42 --> 02:27:53.74
But the long guns and iron aback.

1632
02:27:53.74 --> 02:27:55.38
And I come into this house.

1633
02:27:55.38 --> 02:27:58.42
And what I see in this house is I looked at a left

1634
02:27:58.42 --> 02:27:59.82
in the side of the room.

1635
02:27:59.82 --> 02:28:02.06
And I see three individuals.

1636
02:28:02.06 --> 02:28:05.78
And one of them gets up and he's gray from head to toe.

1637
02:28:05.78 --> 02:28:07.94
And he has a communication cell when I was at.

1638
02:28:07.94 --> 02:28:10.22
And he is burnt with a little bit of a layer.

1639
02:28:10.22 --> 02:28:12.90
The back of his leg is partially missing.

1640
02:28:12.90 --> 02:28:13.82
Something like things there.

1641
02:28:13.82 --> 02:28:16.50
He's got some burns and some trauma.

1642
02:28:16.50 --> 02:28:19.38
And this kid was named Corporal Vaskas.

1643
02:28:19.38 --> 02:28:22.22
And Corporal Vaskas I knew was a crew chief in that other unit

1644
02:28:22.22 --> 02:28:23.98
at that northern bridge.

1645
02:28:23.98 --> 02:28:27.78
And I looked over against the wall and the other two

1646
02:28:27.78 --> 02:28:29.62
crewmen that made it out of those hatches

1647
02:28:29.62 --> 02:28:31.18
were leaning against the wall.

1648
02:28:31.18 --> 02:28:33.10
And they had their uniforms on.

1649
02:28:33.10 --> 02:28:36.90
They remember everybody's in mop conditions.

1650
02:28:36.90 --> 02:28:38.54
So you're fighting in full mop floor.

1651
02:28:38.54 --> 02:28:40.62
This isn't like going to gas chamber just

1652
02:28:40.62 --> 02:28:43.62
to go to training one day and then you strip out all your gear.

1653
02:28:43.62 --> 02:28:45.18
You're in mop for days.

1654
02:28:45.18 --> 02:28:47.82
And you're fighting in that charcoal suit on top of all this

1655
02:28:47.82 --> 02:28:52.30
stuff in that 130 degree with no water anymore

1656
02:28:52.30 --> 02:28:53.94
for these hours.

1657
02:28:53.94 --> 02:28:57.30
And they're sitting against that wall.

1658
02:28:57.30 --> 02:29:02.22
And I can still remember seeing the blood out of the eyes,

1659
02:29:02.22 --> 02:29:03.02
the ears.

1660
02:29:03.02 --> 02:29:05.22
You could tell they were concussed.

1661
02:29:05.22 --> 02:29:06.82
And they were sitting there.

1662
02:29:06.82 --> 02:29:08.54
And Corporal Vaskas comes up.

1663
02:29:08.54 --> 02:29:15.06
And I just told Vaskas, I'm going to get you out of here.

1664
02:29:15.06 --> 02:29:16.94
And he said, I don't want to go anywhere,

1665
02:29:16.94 --> 02:29:18.22
cutting.

1666
02:29:18.22 --> 02:29:21.70
He said, I can still fight.

1667
02:29:21.70 --> 02:29:23.90
Now you're sitting here, having to wounded,

1668
02:29:23.90 --> 02:29:27.26
protect the wounded, right, and anything else.

1669
02:29:27.26 --> 02:29:29.58
Went outside the door, picked up an ooms and hung

1670
02:29:29.58 --> 02:29:30.94
there were on the ground.

1671
02:29:30.94 --> 02:29:32.06
That we're here.

1672
02:29:32.06 --> 02:29:33.86
Came back in, racked around, and put

1673
02:29:33.86 --> 02:29:36.82
a corp of Askas after I patched up his wounds.

1674
02:29:36.82 --> 02:29:38.46
I put him in the doorway.

1675
02:29:38.46 --> 02:29:42.42
And there are still Iraqi voices in the back of the house.

1676
02:29:42.42 --> 02:29:44.70
I figured there's probably five or six rooms in the house.

1677
02:29:44.70 --> 02:29:45.98
They're in the back.

1678
02:29:45.98 --> 02:29:49.74
But the marines are right in the street on the outside of the room.

1679
02:29:49.74 --> 02:29:52.54
And you have access to the back end of the house

1680
02:29:52.54 --> 02:29:55.70
if I put you in this access on his doorway.

1681
02:29:55.70 --> 02:29:57.98
I'm going to go get some help.

1682
02:29:57.98 --> 02:30:01.62
Racked around, per his arms, and said,

1683
02:30:01.62 --> 02:30:02.86
I'm going to come to the right.

1684
02:30:02.86 --> 02:30:05.94
Don't shoot anybody coming from this direction.

1685
02:30:05.94 --> 02:30:07.54
Somebody coming from the left side.

1686
02:30:07.54 --> 02:30:08.98
This is an unsecured facility.

1687
02:30:08.98 --> 02:30:10.82
You know what you have to do, marine.

1688
02:30:10.82 --> 02:30:12.50
And he said, Roger that.

1689
02:30:12.50 --> 02:30:14.98
Went back out, grabbed some more marines,

1690
02:30:14.98 --> 02:30:16.54
some more weapons.

1691
02:30:16.54 --> 02:30:18.50
Come back in, got those three.

1692
02:30:18.50 --> 02:30:21.26
Move them to the vehicle as well.

1693
02:30:21.26 --> 02:30:23.46
Now you're sitting here, having to make the decision.

1694
02:30:23.46 --> 02:30:26.34
Yeah, go, you got to get back on the radio

1695
02:30:26.34 --> 02:30:28.26
to at least let your commander

1696
02:30:28.26 --> 02:30:30.42
and that assess the situation.

1697
02:30:30.42 --> 02:30:33.18
And Captain Mike Brooks was a phenomenal infantry company

1698
02:30:33.18 --> 02:30:36.62
commander on the ground with the boys.

1699
02:30:36.62 --> 02:30:39.46
And he's watching this all happen.

1700
02:30:39.46 --> 02:30:41.18
So he knows we have casualties.

1701
02:30:41.18 --> 02:30:43.46
He knows that we have very serious ones.

1702
02:30:43.46 --> 02:30:46.26
He also knows that we have an M tracking and going anywhere.

1703
02:30:46.26 --> 02:30:49.50
This got US equipment and all this stuff in here.

1704
02:30:49.50 --> 02:30:51.46
And he also knows something is going on

1705
02:30:51.46 --> 02:30:55.46
with the northern bridge that allowed all this to happen down here.

1706
02:30:55.46 --> 02:30:58.10
And this is what you're talking about, you know,

1707
02:30:58.10 --> 02:31:01.70
is that commander, right?

1708
02:31:01.70 --> 02:31:06.70
You're also been told, you will hold that bridge.

1709
02:31:06.70 --> 02:31:09.94
And you're the guy on the ground hearing all this happen now.

1710
02:31:09.94 --> 02:31:12.06
I've got to get people out of here.

1711
02:31:12.06 --> 02:31:15.02
I've got to find a way to get reinforcements up to here.

1712
02:31:15.02 --> 02:31:18.38
I've got to find a way to help to survive.

1713
02:31:18.38 --> 02:31:19.74
You know, when a fire find nobody cares

1714
02:31:19.74 --> 02:31:22.74
to be the president of the United States is they care about

1715
02:31:22.74 --> 02:31:24.50
who's on their left and their right.

1716
02:31:24.50 --> 02:31:26.98
They care about, you know, the promises they made to people

1717
02:31:26.98 --> 02:31:28.10
and we'll bring your son home.

1718
02:31:28.10 --> 02:31:29.90
We're going to do that as a commander.

1719
02:31:29.90 --> 02:31:32.78
But they also know I got a mission.

1720
02:31:32.78 --> 02:31:35.70
My mission is a smaller part of a bigger picture.

1721
02:31:35.70 --> 02:31:37.02
It's here.

1722
02:31:37.02 --> 02:31:38.30
I needed phenomenal.

1723
02:31:38.30 --> 02:31:41.18
And we assess the casualties.

1724
02:31:41.18 --> 02:31:43.38
And we knew him well.

1725
02:31:43.38 --> 02:31:45.98
We can't have any vehicles leaving this position.

1726
02:31:45.98 --> 02:31:50.18
And who in the hell is going to fly helicopter in here?

1727
02:31:50.18 --> 02:31:53.58
It is an intersection where it's in black-walked down when you watch it.

1728
02:31:53.58 --> 02:31:58.42
And just at that time, I relayed the casualties.

1729
02:31:58.42 --> 02:31:59.66
And I heard it come over the net.

1730
02:31:59.66 --> 02:32:00.90
We got an inbound bird.

1731
02:32:00.90 --> 02:32:01.90
It's going to come.

1732
02:32:01.90 --> 02:32:04.90
Let's see H46 is going to come in at the top.

1733
02:32:04.90 --> 02:32:06.78
Kind of looked up in the air.

1734
02:32:06.78 --> 02:32:11.58
We need to get the casualty away from here to provide a more safer

1735
02:32:11.58 --> 02:32:15.94
landing zone for that helicopter, which is about 150 to 100 meters.

1736
02:32:15.94 --> 02:32:18.94
Down a road.

1737
02:32:18.94 --> 02:32:20.58
We start loading up the casualties.

1738
02:32:20.58 --> 02:32:21.58
Just go.

1739
02:32:21.58 --> 02:32:25.38
The other Marines that are there, some other Marines, and we start running them.

1740
02:32:25.38 --> 02:32:30.34
Another 150 meters in an opposite direction to a clearing where we believe we can get

1741
02:32:30.34 --> 02:32:32.50
helicopter in.

1742
02:32:32.50 --> 02:32:35.74
And then we're going to mark that clearing.

1743
02:32:35.74 --> 02:32:39.82
And one of the problems was in the rapid pace of the movement of all this.

1744
02:32:39.82 --> 02:32:44.90
One of the things that we never really did, Ers, was like an aerial signal plan for

1745
02:32:44.90 --> 02:32:47.66
a meta-vax, you know, nine lines, you know everything else.

1746
02:32:47.66 --> 02:32:49.86
But what color smoke, or are you going to throw it?

1747
02:32:49.86 --> 02:32:50.86
What are you going to do?

1748
02:32:50.86 --> 02:32:54.30
Green smoke to the grunts means different than green smoke to helicopter pilot.

1749
02:32:54.30 --> 02:32:57.06
It's on there.

1750
02:32:57.06 --> 02:32:58.06
That's what happens.

1751
02:32:58.06 --> 02:33:02.82
All of Sir runs up and he says, do we have any color smoke grenades?

1752
02:33:02.82 --> 02:33:03.82
We don't.

1753
02:33:03.82 --> 02:33:06.26
So we have like these pyrotechnics.

1754
02:33:06.26 --> 02:33:07.26
Give the pyrotext us.

1755
02:33:07.26 --> 02:33:08.26
He fires a pyrotechnic.

1756
02:33:08.26 --> 02:33:10.26
It bounces off the thing.

1757
02:33:10.26 --> 02:33:13.10
And it kind of just disappears and doesn't do anything.

1758
02:33:13.10 --> 02:33:16.94
And it's one of those things where we're now, I'll go all laughing.

1759
02:33:16.94 --> 02:33:24.22
Even in the middle of this chaos is like, come on man, that's what we had to do.

1760
02:33:24.22 --> 02:33:29.98
And he's sitting there with this rocket looking at me and he goes, and I just started laughing.

1761
02:33:29.98 --> 02:33:37.02
And he started yelling around and someone got a purple grenade.

1762
02:33:37.02 --> 02:33:38.14
Purple smoke.

1763
02:33:38.14 --> 02:33:39.66
He pops this thing.

1764
02:33:39.66 --> 02:33:43.10
He sees the helicopter start to come in.

1765
02:33:43.10 --> 02:33:45.46
The most beautiful things I've ever seen.

1766
02:33:45.46 --> 02:33:51.46
That thing fliers, it comes in and it's in a slide about 75 meters above our head.

1767
02:33:51.46 --> 02:33:53.46
And he sees that smoke pop.

1768
02:33:53.46 --> 02:33:55.86
And the incident when he stops his slide.

1769
02:33:55.86 --> 02:34:00.54
And then he sees smoke pop back in the middle of the intersection where we just took

1770
02:34:00.54 --> 02:34:05.22
the casualty's from and sees green smoke over there.

1771
02:34:05.22 --> 02:34:08.90
And he slides back into that intersection and puts that helicopter down right next to the

1772
02:34:08.90 --> 02:34:10.58
burning electric.

1773
02:34:10.58 --> 02:34:11.58
And it's thing.

1774
02:34:11.58 --> 02:34:13.62
And drops the ramp.

1775
02:34:13.62 --> 02:34:15.46
Now it's on the ground.

1776
02:34:15.46 --> 02:34:19.50
Crew chief kind of walks out when we start making a run toward that because I had found

1777
02:34:19.50 --> 02:34:22.58
out that the purple smoke met don't land here.

1778
02:34:22.58 --> 02:34:24.06
This is a dangerous thing.

1779
02:34:24.06 --> 02:34:25.58
And he saw that pop.

1780
02:34:25.58 --> 02:34:27.54
And he said the green was over there.

1781
02:34:27.54 --> 02:34:28.54
Right?

1782
02:34:28.54 --> 02:34:30.26
The grunts didn't throw that green to mark that land.

1783
02:34:30.26 --> 02:34:33.94
He said they were throwing it to shift fires and do what they had to do.

1784
02:34:33.94 --> 02:34:36.90
And he slid that and put that right down.

1785
02:34:36.90 --> 02:34:40.02
And he's just wearing gunners and walks out the back like John Wayne.

1786
02:34:40.02 --> 02:34:41.66
I'll never remember.

1787
02:34:41.66 --> 02:34:45.26
I mean like you could really tell he's got to know what's going on.

1788
02:34:45.26 --> 02:34:47.94
But he doesn't really know what's going on.

1789
02:34:47.94 --> 02:34:52.38
And he's kind of standing on the ramp, surveying the kingdom that's here.

1790
02:34:52.38 --> 02:34:54.66
And we're all running to the back.

1791
02:34:54.66 --> 02:34:55.90
Casualty's a rim.

1792
02:34:55.90 --> 02:34:58.94
And this is fitted with litter kits in the back of it.

1793
02:34:58.94 --> 02:35:00.42
So it's called in for it.

1794
02:35:00.42 --> 02:35:02.70
And I'm pretty sure it wasn't when it was above there.

1795
02:35:02.70 --> 02:35:03.70
They were doing that.

1796
02:35:03.70 --> 02:35:07.38
Those are Aaron that we have Marines that we have to get them out.

1797
02:35:07.38 --> 02:35:10.10
So they're up there in the air and they're doing that.

1798
02:35:10.10 --> 02:35:12.34
That thing flares down.

1799
02:35:12.34 --> 02:35:17.02
And the first Marines that we get on top of there, blessed the gunneries, aren't

1800
02:35:17.02 --> 02:35:18.02
hard.

1801
02:35:18.02 --> 02:35:19.02
He kept yelling.

1802
02:35:19.02 --> 02:35:21.70
I need you to put them on the top, right?

1803
02:35:21.70 --> 02:35:25.06
Because he needs to fill his bird his way.

1804
02:35:25.06 --> 02:35:28.50
And I'm sitting here like we've been in the streets.

1805
02:35:28.50 --> 02:35:29.94
We've got no juice.

1806
02:35:29.94 --> 02:35:31.50
We've got nothing man.

1807
02:35:31.50 --> 02:35:34.42
We don't realize how dangerous it is.

1808
02:35:34.42 --> 02:35:38.46
And I said, brother, there are PGs here.

1809
02:35:38.46 --> 02:35:40.22
You need to take these Marines and get in.

1810
02:35:40.22 --> 02:35:42.14
He said, are PGs?

1811
02:35:42.14 --> 02:35:43.14
Are you shit?

1812
02:35:43.14 --> 02:35:44.14
Just put them down.

1813
02:35:44.14 --> 02:35:46.34
We'll take care of them.

1814
02:35:46.34 --> 02:35:47.94
And we started running.

1815
02:35:47.94 --> 02:35:49.54
And like I said, bless this heart.

1816
02:35:49.54 --> 02:35:51.02
Now it's not the top rack.

1817
02:35:51.02 --> 02:35:52.54
Now it's less getting into war.

1818
02:35:52.54 --> 02:35:55.26
We're at he has situational awareness.

1819
02:35:55.26 --> 02:36:00.82
And one of the most heartbreaking and proud things I've ever seen in my life though is when

1820
02:36:00.82 --> 02:36:06.30
he took ownership of that and made a decision because he knew lives mattered.

1821
02:36:06.30 --> 02:36:10.74
He's relaying it to the pilot that is up there.

1822
02:36:10.74 --> 02:36:17.74
Without a gunner's bill, that, when we saw it, Jessica was the last Marine we laid on

1823
02:36:17.74 --> 02:36:20.46
the ramp, the biggest one.

1824
02:36:20.46 --> 02:36:23.98
The one with the cranium, I'm trying to say everything else.

1825
02:36:23.98 --> 02:36:26.62
That helicopter, he said, drop him.

1826
02:36:26.62 --> 02:36:28.10
I got him.

1827
02:36:28.10 --> 02:36:32.74
This soon as I got off the back of the helicopter, the helicopter lifted off.

1828
02:36:32.74 --> 02:36:38.28
And the last thing I had saw when I looked up was Jessica's legs hanging out the back

1829
02:36:38.28 --> 02:36:41.62
of the helicopter with blood grip on one of his boots.

1830
02:36:41.62 --> 02:36:46.78
And that, no one was holding him in the helicopter with his own life that may have been

1831
02:36:46.78 --> 02:36:51.54
pulled out the back of that helicopter or something because he said, I got him.

1832
02:36:51.54 --> 02:36:56.10
And when somebody says, I got him and that's another man, another Marine and a conversation,

1833
02:36:56.10 --> 02:36:57.10
you got him.

1834
02:36:57.10 --> 02:36:59.78
That go back to the business you need to do.

1835
02:36:59.78 --> 02:37:06.18
And then somehow, at that time period, we find a second, talk over to get against the wall,

1836
02:37:06.18 --> 02:37:12.98
myself, HN Velasquez, the corpsman, and another Marine that was here.

1837
02:37:12.98 --> 02:37:18.86
And thank God somebody through us, a canteen, had about a half of full of water between

1838
02:37:18.86 --> 02:37:23.98
all three of us because I could feel tunnel vision happening when I sat down at that wall

1839
02:37:23.98 --> 02:37:29.90
in the lights going out. And I could only imagine across the battle line that was everybody.

1840
02:37:29.90 --> 02:37:31.90
But that was happening too.

1841
02:37:31.90 --> 02:37:40.94
And we're still another hour and a half or whatever from that position still being maintained.

1842
02:37:40.94 --> 02:37:44.70
Captain Brooks ran over to me at the time.

1843
02:37:44.70 --> 02:37:50.54
And he said, look, I've got communications with the unit that's coming in behind us.

1844
02:37:50.54 --> 02:37:54.58
They're right on the other side of the bridge. They've reported they're at the bridge.

1845
02:37:54.58 --> 02:37:56.78
So this is going to be a battle hand over.

1846
02:37:56.78 --> 02:38:00.78
He said, I need you to make sure that everybody gets a ride.

1847
02:38:00.78 --> 02:38:03.42
He goes, we're going to push up to the northern bridge.

1848
02:38:03.42 --> 02:38:05.66
And we're going to help those Marines.

1849
02:38:05.66 --> 02:38:07.30
Roger that.

1850
02:38:07.30 --> 02:38:08.62
Everybody gets a ride.

1851
02:38:08.62 --> 02:38:10.58
That means it's Kelly's heroes.

1852
02:38:10.58 --> 02:38:12.86
Lay on top of the cargo hatches.

1853
02:38:12.86 --> 02:38:13.62
Safety is the wind's.

1854
02:38:13.62 --> 02:38:14.46
It doesn't matter.

1855
02:38:14.46 --> 02:38:15.46
You hold on to the side.

1856
02:38:15.46 --> 02:38:16.70
You're getting out of here.

1857
02:38:16.70 --> 02:38:20.18
But you got to make sure you have everybody.

1858
02:38:20.18 --> 02:38:24.42
As we're doing this, the tanks show up.

1859
02:38:24.42 --> 02:38:29.78
And when the tanks came back, you could just see the Marines like Santa Claus just showed

1860
02:38:29.78 --> 02:38:31.62
up on Christmas Eve.

1861
02:38:31.62 --> 02:38:34.50
And they started pulling into positions.

1862
02:38:34.50 --> 02:38:40.14
They're starting to take fire, the perimeter, run over to a tank, jump on the tank again.

1863
02:38:40.14 --> 02:38:41.74
And there was a second story window.

1864
02:38:41.74 --> 02:38:42.74
I can remember it.

1865
02:38:42.74 --> 02:38:43.74
I had red windows in it.

1866
02:38:43.74 --> 02:38:46.10
And we were taking a lot of fire from there.

1867
02:38:46.10 --> 02:38:47.98
And just went over the back of the tank.

1868
02:38:47.98 --> 02:38:53.72
On the tank phone and said, second level windows, red windows, take the top of that building

1869
02:38:53.72 --> 02:38:54.72
off.

1870
02:38:54.72 --> 02:38:56.26
Would you, my pleasure.

1871
02:38:56.26 --> 02:38:57.26
Oh, wow.

1872
02:38:57.26 --> 02:39:02.74
One round through that, no more red windows, no more fire from that area.

1873
02:39:02.74 --> 02:39:08.38
And then that's when it kind of started to die down, because you could see the Iraqis

1874
02:39:08.38 --> 02:39:13.58
probably think and reinforcements of the right over the bridge that are coming.

1875
02:39:13.58 --> 02:39:15.14
Now the tanks are here.

1876
02:39:15.14 --> 02:39:18.58
Now everybody gets a ride, including on those tanks.

1877
02:39:18.58 --> 02:39:24.02
Now we just heard or saw what happened on ambush alley of those vehicles coming through there.

1878
02:39:24.02 --> 02:39:28.18
We just saw the rockets coming off the tops and the rooftops, the buildings.

1879
02:39:28.18 --> 02:39:33.02
Jacob, we're now going to make a run from I1.5 up that to get to that northern bridge

1880
02:39:33.02 --> 02:39:34.82
and go through that gauntlet.

1881
02:39:34.82 --> 02:39:40.42
So once we got a thumbs up that everybody, every swing in American was there.

1882
02:39:40.42 --> 02:39:42.06
It was on that.

1883
02:39:42.06 --> 02:39:44.26
Just gave the order.

1884
02:39:44.26 --> 02:39:48.82
Thanks, stay in the front, because they can swivel the turrets to left on the right side.

1885
02:39:48.82 --> 02:39:53.06
And AV, only has a turret on the starboard side so you can't shoot over the driver's station.

1886
02:39:53.06 --> 02:39:56.58
So trim the AVs and the turrets to the right.

1887
02:39:56.58 --> 02:40:00.66
AVs are going to cover the right hand side of these buildings with their mark 19 grenade launchers

1888
02:40:00.66 --> 02:40:02.58
and their 50 cows.

1889
02:40:02.58 --> 02:40:06.22
And then the tanks are going to swivel and cover left hand side.

1890
02:40:06.22 --> 02:40:11.70
And we were just going to go 45 miles an hour, bump that thing and just lay led the entire

1891
02:40:11.70 --> 02:40:12.70
way.

1892
02:40:12.70 --> 02:40:19.02
But no more arcade G3s come off the buildings, something that I mean, it almost reminds

1893
02:40:19.02 --> 02:40:20.86
you like what you'd see in style and grab.

1894
02:40:20.86 --> 02:40:23.58
And I thought Molotov cocktails are coming next.

1895
02:40:23.58 --> 02:40:27.10
This is what's going to come off into these hatches to do that.

1896
02:40:27.10 --> 02:40:30.06
And we just took levels off of those.

1897
02:40:30.06 --> 02:40:34.30
Kept those all down, got up to the northern bridge.

1898
02:40:34.30 --> 02:40:37.14
And then we got the northern bridge, assessed that.

1899
02:40:37.14 --> 02:40:38.86
Bolster did defense on that northern bridge.

1900
02:40:38.86 --> 02:40:40.10
We now held the southern bridge.

1901
02:40:40.10 --> 02:40:42.02
We now held the northern bridge.

1902
02:40:42.02 --> 02:40:45.46
We reassessed everything for about a day that was up there.

1903
02:40:45.46 --> 02:40:49.06
And then we figured we got to push on out to the western intersection because there's two

1904
02:40:49.06 --> 02:40:54.34
bridges that are on that side over there and start basically having control of all the bridges

1905
02:40:54.34 --> 02:40:55.82
on that city.

1906
02:40:55.82 --> 02:40:59.90
And then within the next 48 hours, that's when the entire first marine division was stacked

1907
02:40:59.90 --> 02:41:01.78
up on that southern bridge.

1908
02:41:01.78 --> 02:41:05.86
And the greatest thing is standing on those bridges.

1909
02:41:05.86 --> 02:41:08.38
Watch and look like the bridge are a magnet.

1910
02:41:08.38 --> 02:41:14.86
The American Army just come through with vehicle after vehicle on the way to Baghdad.

1911
02:41:14.86 --> 02:41:21.74
And feeling at the time with success of we did, but you know, hold until relieved.

1912
02:41:21.74 --> 02:41:23.66
That's that age old American.

1913
02:41:23.66 --> 02:41:28.46
That's that that's general McCallough telling people not that's that's your generation

1914
02:41:28.46 --> 02:41:30.30
of doing that.

1915
02:41:30.30 --> 02:41:33.38
And saying, you know, so I get a little testy.

1916
02:41:33.38 --> 02:41:38.34
And I go when people try to claim that this generation is, you know, the millennials and

1917
02:41:38.34 --> 02:41:40.26
they will never hold up to their forefathers.

1918
02:41:40.26 --> 02:41:43.42
And they will, yeah, every generation has jackasses.

1919
02:41:43.42 --> 02:41:44.42
They're out there.

1920
02:41:44.42 --> 02:41:45.42
They do.

1921
02:41:45.42 --> 02:41:47.94
Every generation have the ones matter too.

1922
02:41:47.94 --> 02:41:50.14
That no one to chips are down.

1923
02:41:50.14 --> 02:41:53.54
They really rise up and they rise up the occasion.

1924
02:41:53.54 --> 02:41:58.66
And we are lucky to be associated with a lot of people like that all the way through those

1925
02:41:58.66 --> 02:41:59.66
battles.

1926
02:41:59.66 --> 02:42:02.26
And that battle kicked off when you started to come in.

1927
02:42:02.26 --> 02:42:07.66
And then, you know, unfortunately, we're still putting people in our line 10 and that today.

1928
02:42:07.66 --> 02:42:11.66
Still holding to that truth.

1929
02:42:11.66 --> 02:42:20.90
The overall, I was, I think the numbers are you, you guys lost seven of your tracks.

1930
02:42:20.90 --> 02:42:25.30
Is that right in Nazarena?

1931
02:42:25.30 --> 02:42:27.26
18 18 Marines killed.

1932
02:42:27.26 --> 02:42:29.46
Eventually it was only teen.

1933
02:42:29.46 --> 02:42:30.46
That was on there.

1934
02:42:30.46 --> 02:42:31.46
I put them all.

1935
02:42:31.46 --> 02:42:33.18
We have everything that's on here.

1936
02:42:33.18 --> 02:42:36.34
I've carried that for over almost 29 years.

1937
02:42:36.34 --> 02:42:37.74
That was given to me as a young troop.

1938
02:42:37.74 --> 02:42:41.14
It was a map case left over from Vietnam.

1939
02:42:41.14 --> 02:42:42.98
It was on that.

1940
02:42:42.98 --> 02:42:48.02
And those are all the guys from Tasswurst, Tarle.

1941
02:42:48.02 --> 02:42:49.82
That were on that day.

1942
02:42:49.82 --> 02:42:53.66
The rank that my wife pulled off when I got home off my collar that I was wearing in the

1943
02:42:53.66 --> 02:42:56.54
street that day, which started black.

1944
02:42:56.54 --> 02:42:58.38
And it has no black left on it.

1945
02:42:58.38 --> 02:43:00.26
It was here.

1946
02:43:00.26 --> 02:43:01.42
That was the rank.

1947
02:43:01.42 --> 02:43:06.70
She pulled off my collar when I survived the cemetery fight in the Jaff in 2004.

1948
02:43:06.70 --> 02:43:08.82
First, the time in fourth Marines.

1949
02:43:08.82 --> 02:43:10.30
And then that was the rank when I got home.

1950
02:43:10.30 --> 02:43:15.06
She pulled off my collar when I brought first recombatine out of the Yazidi mountain

1951
02:43:15.06 --> 02:43:18.22
range and that up at the South Central Mountain range.

1952
02:43:18.22 --> 02:43:20.70
That's the Marines from 2003.

1953
02:43:20.70 --> 02:43:29.22
That is Jessica Lynch's column of the soldiers that are memorialized on there that had given

1954
02:43:29.22 --> 02:43:31.10
their lives that day.

1955
02:43:31.10 --> 02:43:44.22
And then on the backside of there was the Marines from BLT-14 in the cemetery fight in 2004.

1956
02:43:44.22 --> 02:43:50.82
What was the, once you guys got relieved, what was the next thing that you guys did?

1957
02:43:50.82 --> 02:43:55.82
We had to pull out of that position and we went up to Al-Qut that was, we were basically

1958
02:43:55.82 --> 02:44:01.86
going to stay out near Al-Mora in that sector that was over here.

1959
02:44:01.86 --> 02:44:03.74
And we went up to Al-Qut to reinforce.

1960
02:44:03.74 --> 02:44:05.10
That was how Al-Qut.

1961
02:44:05.10 --> 02:44:08.94
We pushed all the way out to the border in Al-Mora.

1962
02:44:08.94 --> 02:44:14.18
We did a counter offensive against the 51st mechanized division that was actually mounting

1963
02:44:14.18 --> 02:44:16.10
a counter offensive.

1964
02:44:16.10 --> 02:44:22.66
But when we were actually in the city and we were still running, Jago, about the 26th that

1965
02:44:22.66 --> 02:44:24.70
was in there.

1966
02:44:24.70 --> 02:44:26.74
The supply trains have still not come through.

1967
02:44:26.74 --> 02:44:28.38
This is three days.

1968
02:44:28.38 --> 02:44:36.38
So the Marines that were missing their gear, what we had ours do is, if you have two, you

1969
02:44:36.38 --> 02:44:39.78
only need one, therefore give one to your brother.

1970
02:44:39.78 --> 02:44:43.18
Throw it out behind the vehicle in Pontius.

1971
02:44:43.18 --> 02:44:47.50
Canteen's backpacks, whatever you can do to give the guys who just lost their gear and

1972
02:44:47.50 --> 02:44:51.06
all those things, something to live with.

1973
02:44:51.06 --> 02:44:57.02
Then we're down to less than an eighth of a tank of fuel on each of these vehicles that are

1974
02:44:57.02 --> 02:45:01.18
overlooking the sedan canow back into the city and we're preparing for what we hear is

1975
02:45:01.18 --> 02:45:06.26
a 2,000 man counter offensive that is going to come by boats and by armored vehicles that's

1976
02:45:06.26 --> 02:45:08.82
coming out of the center of the city.

1977
02:45:08.82 --> 02:45:13.62
And in order to maintain the radios and AV, you have to have the AV run to charge the radio

1978
02:45:13.62 --> 02:45:15.98
systems that are on there.

1979
02:45:15.98 --> 02:45:18.46
We're down to about an eighth of a tank.

1980
02:45:18.46 --> 02:45:22.22
So you'd shut your vehicle off for a while, you don't want to charge it up, run it for about

1981
02:45:22.22 --> 02:45:26.46
10 minutes to keep the radio filled so it doesn't drop the fills and the radios.

1982
02:45:26.46 --> 02:45:30.26
And you shut them back down to conserve mass.

1983
02:45:30.26 --> 02:45:32.70
You're down to, there's no MREs.

1984
02:45:32.70 --> 02:45:34.86
There is nothing.

1985
02:45:34.86 --> 02:45:39.34
You aren't drinking the water in the vehicles and this is what I love about armored

1986
02:45:39.34 --> 02:45:41.90
crew and that people just don't know.

1987
02:45:41.90 --> 02:45:46.70
Jagger was, it's horse gun and man.

1988
02:45:46.70 --> 02:45:49.06
You always take care of your ride first.

1989
02:45:49.06 --> 02:45:50.30
You take care of your weapons first.

1990
02:45:50.30 --> 02:45:52.06
You take care of yourself last.

1991
02:45:52.06 --> 02:45:55.74
That doesn't matter if you're a ground pounder, you're a team need to matter.

1992
02:45:55.74 --> 02:45:59.78
It's the same thing just a different concept, applied a different way.

1993
02:45:59.78 --> 02:46:06.42
You don't drink the horse as a water because the horse needs the water to still survive.

1994
02:46:06.42 --> 02:46:11.02
So the water is the vehicles that are overheating and all of this.

1995
02:46:11.02 --> 02:46:14.42
You can't drink the vehicle water out of the 5 gallon water cans because you've got to

1996
02:46:14.42 --> 02:46:18.66
cool the radios down to keep the vehicles going.

1997
02:46:18.66 --> 02:46:26.14
So you kind of start sharing what looks like, I don't know, like shaving cream like a shaving

1998
02:46:26.14 --> 02:46:32.50
cream lid full of water just to get a little bit of water and continue to do that.

1999
02:46:32.50 --> 02:46:37.86
Split down one MRE between seven individuals start hacking that thing apart to whatever

2000
02:46:37.86 --> 02:46:42.94
to stretch that out and then you're sitting in there on watch and you're not on 50% and

2001
02:46:42.94 --> 02:46:48.18
you're not a it's 100% because this is the counter offensive.

2002
02:46:48.18 --> 02:46:53.06
We heard their common and the most glorious thing happened is one they didn't come.

2003
02:46:53.06 --> 02:46:59.26
The reason they didn't come is because the Marine artillery and repute 900 rounds I believe

2004
02:46:59.26 --> 02:47:04.74
into that city that night in this parking garage area where they were supposedly massing

2005
02:47:04.74 --> 02:47:09.78
and did just a battery for a fact that was in that they completely crushed that counter

2006
02:47:09.78 --> 02:47:12.70
offensive in the middle of that city.

2007
02:47:12.70 --> 02:47:14.10
It would have been a hell of a fight.

2008
02:47:14.10 --> 02:47:19.86
If 2000 of them started swimming into that battle position after the Marines had been

2009
02:47:19.86 --> 02:47:24.94
about three days down on food water, you're still on ammunition.

2010
02:47:24.94 --> 02:47:30.22
You only have the ammo that still left, you brought across with you the first time.

2011
02:47:30.22 --> 02:47:35.82
So I learned tricks of the trade along the way, Jack, that helped people like that.

2012
02:47:35.82 --> 02:47:40.34
That's why history is important.

2013
02:47:40.34 --> 02:47:44.74
You said looking at citations on buildings and learning about saying I want to meet that

2014
02:47:44.74 --> 02:47:45.74
person.

2015
02:47:45.74 --> 02:47:48.82
I don't know why I want to meet that person but something tells me I want to meet that

2016
02:47:48.82 --> 02:47:49.82
person.

2017
02:47:49.82 --> 02:47:57.42
I grew up with stories of Hill 488 and in Howard's Hill and Jimmy Howard in 1966 takes

2018
02:47:57.42 --> 02:48:04.42
a Marine recon Patrol of 19 above the case on operating base and inserts for three days

2019
02:48:04.42 --> 02:48:09.06
and within hours Howard is completely wounded.

2020
02:48:09.06 --> 02:48:14.54
He has to crawl from position to position because he can't use his legs with a radio to

2021
02:48:14.54 --> 02:48:20.94
continue to repel and envy a regiment that is heading towards that fire base and he stays

2022
02:48:20.94 --> 02:48:27.38
on top of that hill for days and as a running low on ammunition, Jimmy Howard tells his

2023
02:48:27.38 --> 02:48:31.14
boys throw rocks at the enemy.

2024
02:48:31.14 --> 02:48:34.38
One, you're like, that's the mindset.

2025
02:48:34.38 --> 02:48:37.58
That's the killer instinct, the mindset we were talking about.

2026
02:48:37.58 --> 02:48:42.10
You know what, it's also the resilience because he told him when they're like, throw rocks

2027
02:48:42.10 --> 02:48:43.34
or you crazy.

2028
02:48:43.34 --> 02:48:46.86
He said the enemy at night will think it's a hand grenade and they would jump out of the

2029
02:48:46.86 --> 02:48:52.82
way and you can kill them with a single shot, rat to conserve your ammunition.

2030
02:48:52.82 --> 02:48:53.82
Genius.

2031
02:48:53.82 --> 02:48:58.78
And he said they were making single shot kills all along the perimeter, every night holding

2032
02:48:58.78 --> 02:49:00.58
that perimeter.

2033
02:49:00.58 --> 02:49:06.22
And then when the 27th Marines came in three days later, Howard refused to be met a

2034
02:49:06.22 --> 02:49:07.46
fact off of that hill.

2035
02:49:07.46 --> 02:49:12.54
They were calling danger close within 50 meters on that hill, everything.

2036
02:49:12.54 --> 02:49:15.82
And they repulsed that entire illusion.

2037
02:49:15.82 --> 02:49:21.10
18 reconmarades, hell, and pushed them back.

2038
02:49:21.10 --> 02:49:26.46
Howard only said he would get on the helicopter when the last one of his Marines was found.

2039
02:49:26.46 --> 02:49:31.50
And they found him dead in Deaths struggle with two NBA soldiers who were trying to drag

2040
02:49:31.50 --> 02:49:33.46
him off the top of that hill.

2041
02:49:33.46 --> 02:49:37.66
And the infantry Marines refused to leave until they got all on Howard's boys and they

2042
02:49:37.66 --> 02:49:41.62
put him on the helicopter with Howard.

2043
02:49:41.62 --> 02:49:47.38
One Medal of Honor, four Navy crosses, 13 silver stars and everybody on that hill was

2044
02:49:47.38 --> 02:49:52.46
multiply wounded to do that and held their mission.

2045
02:49:52.46 --> 02:49:56.34
Food, water, rations all depleted.

2046
02:49:56.34 --> 02:49:58.14
I knew things like that.

2047
02:49:58.14 --> 02:49:59.82
And I grew up on things like that.

2048
02:49:59.82 --> 02:50:05.18
And I had an knowledge of, on my time and on my generation, on my watch.

2049
02:50:05.18 --> 02:50:06.42
Their generation could do that.

2050
02:50:06.42 --> 02:50:09.26
This generation can hold that line to do that too.

2051
02:50:09.26 --> 02:50:14.02
And in those times when those individual young kids are scared and they do that, to show

2052
02:50:14.02 --> 02:50:19.10
them the resilience of people who wore their uniform or held their positions before.

2053
02:50:19.10 --> 02:50:22.70
And then to say, you have a legacy.

2054
02:50:22.70 --> 02:50:24.54
This is what Americans do.

2055
02:50:24.54 --> 02:50:26.50
And you'll do that for that.

2056
02:50:26.50 --> 02:50:28.70
It gives you amplified fighting power.

2057
02:50:28.70 --> 02:50:33.46
It's almost like on a video game when you see your life for a start to increasing.

2058
02:50:33.46 --> 02:50:35.58
Now you know you don't have food, you don't have water.

2059
02:50:35.58 --> 02:50:39.22
Well, let's not start thinking about the things we don't have.

2060
02:50:39.22 --> 02:50:42.42
And let's start focusing on the positive things we do have.

2061
02:50:42.42 --> 02:50:45.18
And then that just, the food, the water, and that goes down this way.

2062
02:50:45.18 --> 02:50:49.50
But you're pride discipline and everything else starts counter-wading that.

2063
02:50:49.50 --> 02:50:54.30
To where you still feel like regardless, come on man.

2064
02:50:54.30 --> 02:50:55.30
It doesn't matter.

2065
02:50:55.30 --> 02:50:56.90
Whatever you got, bring it.

2066
02:50:56.90 --> 02:51:07.42
At what point did you guys leave Nazaree?

2067
02:51:07.42 --> 02:51:11.90
It was, for good, we actually came back down that way.

2068
02:51:11.90 --> 02:51:20.62
But for good, not long after the teams came in and was able to secure Jessica Lynch out

2069
02:51:20.62 --> 02:51:26.66
of the hospital, which was roughly, I think, March 30, the first time frame is when we

2070
02:51:26.66 --> 02:51:31.14
had done and accomplished all of that, everything out at the other bridges as well.

2071
02:51:31.14 --> 02:51:36.06
And then started to have to pull out of there on the way to, on the way to Alkut.

2072
02:51:36.06 --> 02:51:40.18
How much longer did your disappointment last for you guys?

2073
02:51:40.18 --> 02:51:41.18
Not long.

2074
02:51:41.18 --> 02:51:44.86
We were in country until about the middle of May that was on there.

2075
02:51:44.86 --> 02:51:48.82
And it was kind of like, first in this time it wasn't last out.

2076
02:51:48.82 --> 02:51:53.46
It was kind of like first in and you guys got chewed up and held your line.

2077
02:51:53.46 --> 02:51:56.46
So let's get you on back down south.

2078
02:51:56.46 --> 02:51:59.06
We had to, the vehicles were show shot up.

2079
02:51:59.06 --> 02:52:01.74
Jacob, we couldn't swim them back aboard the ship.

2080
02:52:01.74 --> 02:52:07.14
So we had to load all the vehicles and to black bottom civilian shipping and drive them in.

2081
02:52:07.14 --> 02:52:12.22
So we made a trip all the way back on the USS Sipan.

2082
02:52:12.22 --> 02:52:14.30
I believe it was.

2083
02:52:14.30 --> 02:52:15.50
I may be wrong about that way.

2084
02:52:15.50 --> 02:52:18.46
It was an LHA, but we didn't have our equipment.

2085
02:52:18.46 --> 02:52:19.46
We didn't have our machinery.

2086
02:52:19.46 --> 02:52:25.70
So the rigorous training regime that we had on the way over on ship was not so rigorous

2087
02:52:25.70 --> 02:52:26.70
on the way back.

2088
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:31.94
You know, a lot of car playing, a lot of a warb riding, a lot of things that you could

2089
02:52:31.94 --> 02:52:34.50
be able to do that you did.

2090
02:52:34.50 --> 02:52:39.50
So and then we went back through Rota and we came back in and offloaded all that equipment.

2091
02:52:39.50 --> 02:52:41.50
We were kind of back home by the middle of May.

2092
02:52:41.50 --> 02:52:47.70
It was on it, not middle of May, but June, June timeframe.

2093
02:52:47.70 --> 02:52:55.26
What was the, you know, adjusting, you're coming back, losing so many guys, what was the,

2094
02:52:55.26 --> 02:52:59.82
how did you handle that with the families when you guys got home?

2095
02:52:59.82 --> 02:53:01.34
What did that, what did that look like?

2096
02:53:01.34 --> 02:53:05.42
Well, I'll tell you the, you've seen we were soldiers once and young.

2097
02:53:05.42 --> 02:53:11.82
It was here and when Hal Moore's wife asked a deliverer telegrams and she takes ownership

2098
02:53:11.82 --> 02:53:16.22
saying, you know, give those to me and I'll walk around and I'll do that.

2099
02:53:16.22 --> 02:53:21.46
casually a sense in 2003 and not became what it is now.

2100
02:53:21.46 --> 02:53:26.90
It wasn't, you know, a chap on doing this kind of the way that Kiko calls her made now.

2101
02:53:26.90 --> 02:53:32.10
My wife didn't hear from me because I had a rule in the platoon.

2102
02:53:32.10 --> 02:53:36.66
You know, I go to the leadership where the last ones to get the eridium phone to call anybody,

2103
02:53:36.66 --> 02:53:39.30
every single person gets to call first.

2104
02:53:39.30 --> 02:53:42.78
Once the last person is called, bring me the eridium phone call.

2105
02:53:42.78 --> 02:53:48.66
They hand her around on March 17th, we were pulling out and about one in the morning,

2106
02:53:48.66 --> 02:53:52.98
that night, my son has heard and knocks on the edge, says the need to come out here,

2107
02:53:52.98 --> 02:53:57.70
kind of, and stepped outside the entire platoon was standing there and he says they want you

2108
02:53:57.70 --> 02:54:01.30
to make your phone call, they've all managed to make their phone call home.

2109
02:54:01.30 --> 02:54:04.18
So I dialed the phone and I talked to myself on the answer machine.

2110
02:54:04.18 --> 02:54:09.06
At the house, as my wife wouldn't home, they were at Walmart or something like that.

2111
02:54:09.06 --> 02:54:11.22
She said that they ran into the house, right?

2112
02:54:11.22 --> 02:54:18.10
As I was cutting off and the thing, and then she did not hear from me until April 23.

2113
02:54:18.10 --> 02:54:19.22
The first time.

2114
02:54:19.22 --> 02:54:24.18
And I had went through a battle position about 60 miles south of Warnazari.

2115
02:54:24.18 --> 02:54:28.42
It was that we heard that there were AVs, another AV unit, and they had parts.

2116
02:54:28.42 --> 02:54:32.42
Because they could do, and I needed hydraulic parts and a lot of other things.

2117
02:54:32.42 --> 02:54:37.46
Went down there and when I got in the compound, one of my best friends was in charge of that unit.

2118
02:54:37.46 --> 02:54:42.66
And it had like a Mars phone and everything else that was here and I'm like, oh my god.

2119
02:54:42.66 --> 02:54:44.74
And there was 150 people in line.

2120
02:54:44.74 --> 02:54:46.10
It was out there was no internet.

2121
02:54:46.10 --> 02:54:48.02
There's nothing, what we have now, right?

2122
02:54:48.02 --> 02:54:51.06
And he just got me out of the thing.

2123
02:54:51.06 --> 02:54:53.06
He just looked and he said, I'm so glad to hear.

2124
02:54:53.06 --> 02:54:55.62
I heard about what you're doing up there, because you look like shit man.

2125
02:54:55.62 --> 02:54:58.10
I said, well, I'm nice to see you too.

2126
02:54:58.10 --> 02:55:01.30
I love those kind of conversations.

2127
02:55:01.30 --> 02:55:04.58
And then he just grabbed me and he said, you're not standing in here.

2128
02:55:04.58 --> 02:55:07.14
Go to the front line, call your wife.

2129
02:55:07.14 --> 02:55:10.02
Right up the front, not a single one.

2130
02:55:10.02 --> 02:55:11.78
There's 150 people said, why is that?

2131
02:55:11.78 --> 02:55:13.78
I mean, I was still cinched from head to toe.

2132
02:55:13.78 --> 02:55:14.82
They could see the difference.

2133
02:55:14.82 --> 02:55:19.62
It was here walked in, called her and I got to talk to her and say I was kind of okay.

2134
02:55:19.62 --> 02:55:24.26
But Jacob, my wife and daughter found out where I was at.

2135
02:55:25.62 --> 02:55:29.94
Just like people did in the I drank family in 1965.

2136
02:55:29.94 --> 02:55:33.86
Jacksonville, North Carolina, they did not know we were at.

2137
02:55:33.86 --> 02:55:36.98
We were a mission secret and a river city, the whole entire time.

2138
02:55:37.62 --> 02:55:40.18
We took our vehicles and put them on the ship.

2139
02:55:40.18 --> 02:55:44.58
And before we did that, we did the combat lane markings on the sides of the vehicles.

2140
02:55:44.58 --> 02:55:45.94
Then we knew that.

2141
02:55:45.94 --> 02:55:49.54
And then we kind of had a family day where the families could come down to say goodbye.

2142
02:55:49.54 --> 02:55:51.78
My daughter would always come down, play around the vehicles.

2143
02:55:52.82 --> 02:55:57.62
They're sitting at home on March 23rd and they see the news come on.

2144
02:55:58.58 --> 02:56:02.26
And it shows burning amtrax in Nazaria.

2145
02:56:02.82 --> 02:56:07.78
And the ticker across the bottom says United States Marines taking heavy casualties in Nazaria.

2146
02:56:07.78 --> 02:56:14.74
And the vehicles that they saw my daughter yield for mom to come into the house.

2147
02:56:15.30 --> 02:56:16.90
And she said I know where dad's at.

2148
02:56:17.70 --> 02:56:20.18
And she goes, hers are dance vehicle markings.

2149
02:56:20.18 --> 02:56:21.46
They're on the side of that.

2150
02:56:21.46 --> 02:56:23.46
On that news, flipping was there.

2151
02:56:25.22 --> 02:56:27.62
And then I asked her, I said, what was it like?

2152
02:56:28.02 --> 02:56:30.90
After that, they're not knowing the rest of the night she goes.

2153
02:56:31.62 --> 02:56:33.30
Nobody answered the phone for weeks.

2154
02:56:33.30 --> 02:56:34.98
Nobody went outside their house.

2155
02:56:34.98 --> 02:56:37.22
You didn't want to have anybody come to your house.

2156
02:56:37.22 --> 02:56:38.34
You didn't want to know.

2157
02:56:38.34 --> 02:56:43.78
She said because you would hear that seven or eight houses down the road so and so it was husband.

2158
02:56:43.78 --> 02:56:45.94
It was just notified that they're not coming home.

2159
02:56:45.94 --> 02:56:49.70
And then over in the next thousand areas someone says it was not going to come home.

2160
02:56:50.34 --> 02:56:52.58
And then they don't know if you're coming home.

2161
02:56:53.22 --> 02:56:54.66
This is a whole month later.

2162
02:56:54.90 --> 02:56:56.58
And they know every single day.

2163
02:56:56.90 --> 02:57:01.70
You know, it's like America watching the Vietnam War, it didn't or every night.

2164
02:57:01.70 --> 02:57:04.26
I know my sons in there, I know one of those men's in there.

2165
02:57:05.30 --> 02:57:06.98
And I know am I going to see them again.

2166
02:57:07.30 --> 02:57:09.38
And then you don't hear from them on a month later.

2167
02:57:09.78 --> 02:57:10.82
I can't imagine.

2168
02:57:11.78 --> 02:57:13.70
So the hardest thing I've ever had to do in life.

2169
02:57:14.58 --> 02:57:20.82
I go never compares to the men who anguish of somebody sitting there not knowing whether or not

2170
02:57:20.82 --> 02:57:23.22
the person that they love is going to come back home or not.

2171
02:57:23.94 --> 02:57:26.98
Which I believe at a very huge arriving force,

2172
02:57:26.98 --> 02:57:31.38
juggling to my second career on what I did when I hung that uniform up.

2173
02:57:34.98 --> 02:57:36.90
And then you guys get home.

2174
02:57:36.90 --> 02:57:40.82
Are you now did you just roll right into another workup?

2175
02:57:40.82 --> 02:57:46.10
Again, what I did is we start patching everything up and rest in refit.

2176
02:57:46.10 --> 02:57:47.62
I get orders.

2177
02:57:47.62 --> 02:57:48.66
I get promoted.

2178
02:57:48.66 --> 02:57:49.62
It's out of that.

2179
02:57:49.62 --> 02:57:51.86
Now I become a first sergeant in the Marines.

2180
02:57:52.90 --> 02:57:54.50
And I was sent out to the West Coast.

2181
02:57:54.50 --> 02:57:58.66
And I was waiting around on an amtrak unit for a while when I got the call.

2182
02:57:59.38 --> 02:58:00.82
And they said congratulations.

2183
02:58:00.82 --> 02:58:03.46
You're now a first sergeant in the difference in the Marine Corps in the first sergeant.

2184
02:58:03.46 --> 02:58:07.14
And that now opens up the opportunities for you to go anywhere.

2185
02:58:07.14 --> 02:58:08.50
It's a leadership role.

2186
02:58:08.50 --> 02:58:09.86
So now you can go to the infantry.

2187
02:58:09.86 --> 02:58:11.30
You can go there when you go anywhere else.

2188
02:58:11.30 --> 02:58:14.02
And I want to stay in ground combat.

2189
02:58:14.66 --> 02:58:15.30
In entire time.

2190
02:58:15.86 --> 02:58:17.70
So I requested to go to the infantry.

2191
02:58:17.70 --> 02:58:21.30
And I said there was a battalion working up for deployment right now.

2192
02:58:21.30 --> 02:58:22.66
First battalion for the Marines.

2193
02:58:22.66 --> 02:58:25.46
There are about 20 miles north of where this is at.

2194
02:58:25.46 --> 02:58:30.34
And before my sergeant major could tell me whether or not I had orders.

2195
02:58:30.34 --> 02:58:34.26
I kind of wargamed it and said I recall that sergeant major to see if you had a slot.

2196
02:58:34.26 --> 02:58:35.54
And they have a slot open.

2197
02:58:35.54 --> 02:58:36.50
Can I pack my stuff?

2198
02:58:37.06 --> 02:58:38.26
Made a few phone calls.

2199
02:58:38.26 --> 02:58:38.90
Pack my stuff.

2200
02:58:38.90 --> 02:58:40.74
Went up with First Battalion, Fourth Marines.

2201
02:58:40.74 --> 02:58:46.26
And then started kind of the infantry career that then blossomed into a reconnaissance career.

2202
02:58:46.26 --> 02:58:48.42
A much older age out of that.

2203
02:58:48.42 --> 02:58:51.78
And I kind of got that perverse wish.

2204
02:58:51.78 --> 02:58:53.54
You know, other than being a drone instructor.

2205
02:58:54.34 --> 02:58:56.98
And other than spending a couple years in school.

2206
02:58:57.86 --> 02:59:00.34
Being in my own amtrak instructor that was on there.

2207
02:59:00.58 --> 02:59:03.94
I spent an entire 30 million year in US Marine Corps in Ground Combat.

2208
02:59:04.50 --> 02:59:06.58
From private all the way up to sergeant major.

2209
02:59:07.62 --> 02:59:09.86
I would not have changed a single day of that.

2210
02:59:10.42 --> 02:59:12.66
Doesn't matter if you crawl out of bed backwards.

2211
02:59:12.66 --> 02:59:14.42
Doesn't matter if you have to have your wife.

2212
02:59:14.42 --> 02:59:15.70
Help put your boots on.

2213
02:59:15.70 --> 02:59:16.66
Certain days.

2214
02:59:16.66 --> 02:59:17.62
Because a certain pain.

2215
02:59:18.34 --> 02:59:20.58
I've never changed any of that pain in days.

2216
02:59:20.58 --> 02:59:23.14
To change any of that career path along that line.

2217
02:59:23.14 --> 02:59:25.14
So that's how I ended up back in California.

2218
02:59:26.18 --> 02:59:28.02
Pack them up, brought them back out there.

2219
02:59:28.82 --> 02:59:34.42
Went with the first Battalion, Fourth Marines.

2220
02:59:34.42 --> 02:59:36.66
And we were supposed to do a regular float.

2221
02:59:36.66 --> 02:59:37.62
It was out there.

2222
02:59:37.62 --> 02:59:40.58
And our mue got set right into a take-up out of the space.

2223
02:59:41.70 --> 02:59:45.38
And that was a six month float that turned into, I think, 14 months.

2224
02:59:46.42 --> 02:59:48.90
You guys were, you guys were just kept getting extended.

2225
02:59:48.90 --> 02:59:50.82
So we started on ship.

2226
02:59:50.82 --> 02:59:54.10
And we were just supposed to do a normal West.

2227
02:59:54.10 --> 02:59:59.14
Yeah, like just a normal, like we're seeing out here right now with the 15th mue, the 11th to 13th.

2228
02:59:59.14 --> 02:59:59.46
Mm-hmm.

2229
02:59:59.46 --> 03:00:01.70
Then you do one month out of there.

2230
03:00:01.70 --> 03:00:03.14
You're going straight into Iraq.

2231
03:00:03.70 --> 03:00:05.62
You're going straight into the Ambar province.

2232
03:00:06.02 --> 03:00:10.18
You guys are going in to take an asiaf in this battle space from the US Army.

2233
03:00:10.58 --> 03:00:13.46
And I remember the first of the four Alpha Company, first of the 14th,

2234
03:00:14.66 --> 03:00:16.58
2015, that's where you'd be tropical lightning.

2235
03:00:16.58 --> 03:00:18.26
Mm-hmm.

2236
03:00:18.26 --> 03:00:19.06
Was in there in that battle space.

2237
03:00:19.06 --> 03:00:20.26
And they had moved down.

2238
03:00:20.26 --> 03:00:22.66
They were up around to crit and they kept moving them down and that.

2239
03:00:22.66 --> 03:00:24.26
And they moved them in there.

2240
03:00:24.26 --> 03:00:26.66
And we moved in to take the battle space.

2241
03:00:27.30 --> 03:00:31.46
And once you hold battle space, you don't hold, you don't leave until it's secure.

2242
03:00:31.46 --> 03:00:37.86
And that six month deployment turned into 11 months, 12 months, 13 months.

2243
03:00:37.86 --> 03:00:45.94
So in my, I was on deployment 2003, 2004,

2244
03:00:46.74 --> 03:00:49.62
probably the last mission that we did.

2245
03:00:49.62 --> 03:00:54.66
The last significant mission that we did was we went down to

2246
03:00:56.42 --> 03:00:56.98
Najoff.

2247
03:00:57.78 --> 03:00:59.14
And we captured

2248
03:01:01.94 --> 03:01:03.30
Saadur's top lieutenant.

2249
03:01:03.30 --> 03:01:09.62
And that really caused some, well, it's, it sent things out of control.

2250
03:01:09.62 --> 03:01:12.50
And we, you know, we were execute in the mission, you know, it was one of,

2251
03:01:12.50 --> 03:01:14.58
we'd been looking at Saadur the whole time.

2252
03:01:15.30 --> 03:01:19.94
There was, there was a lot of hesitation to go and get Saadur worrying about what would happen.

2253
03:01:20.34 --> 03:01:25.06
And so I think it wasn't attitude of, hey, you know, we're, we don't know if maybe it's the best

2254
03:01:25.06 --> 03:01:26.10
called a Go Get Saadur.

2255
03:01:27.14 --> 03:01:30.18
Let's see what happens if we grab one of his boys and

2256
03:01:30.18 --> 03:01:32.74
get it up, that's what we did.

2257
03:01:33.54 --> 03:01:36.02
That was in early April.

2258
03:01:36.50 --> 03:01:37.38
We went and did it.

2259
03:01:38.34 --> 03:01:43.62
Mayhem broke out and, you know, Saadur city, you turned into total chaos,

2260
03:01:44.42 --> 03:01:50.58
Najoff erupted and, and like a, you know, I feel awful.

2261
03:01:50.58 --> 03:01:54.98
Look, we went home, you know, so that was it for, for that deployment for me.

2262
03:01:54.98 --> 03:01:59.62
And this is ends up and there's just, you know, the way things connect, it ends up for you,

2263
03:01:59.62 --> 03:02:07.54
you're in Najoff and, and you guys end up going through that city and some, you know, some, some

2264
03:02:07.54 --> 03:02:08.26
tough fighting.

2265
03:02:09.30 --> 03:02:15.54
Yeah, actually, uh, when you go in the city and you're doing, you're working with the ING,

2266
03:02:15.54 --> 03:02:21.14
405, 404th, the Iraq National Garden, you're sent there to train them up and you're doing that.

2267
03:02:21.94 --> 03:02:25.70
And then you're actually figuring out every day that we give you a bunch of weapons tomorrow

2268
03:02:25.70 --> 03:02:28.82
when we do the weapons count, where's all your weapons at?

2269
03:02:28.82 --> 03:02:33.30
Doesn't take a genius to figure out right now while you're training a battalion that has an

2270
03:02:33.30 --> 03:02:38.10
attrition rate or a desertion rate, the following day after they're trained and then you continue

2271
03:02:38.10 --> 03:02:41.06
to do that is the point of, of like, lunacy.

2272
03:02:41.06 --> 03:02:43.22
I think it's the definition of doing that.

2273
03:02:43.46 --> 03:02:45.30
So then you don't start doing that.

2274
03:02:45.94 --> 03:02:49.14
You start building them as much as you can in these resilient things.

2275
03:02:49.14 --> 03:02:53.70
You back up the police stations more importantly, when we took over the battle space

2276
03:02:53.70 --> 03:02:57.30
from the army, it wasn't that the army didn't have the fire to keep them.

2277
03:02:57.30 --> 03:03:03.06
But the two at the rules of engagement for them were when we would do the left seat right seat

2278
03:03:03.06 --> 03:03:05.70
rides, they would tell you exactly where everybody's at?

2279
03:03:06.66 --> 03:03:09.38
There's where side or house you say, you don't want to go by here.

2280
03:03:09.38 --> 03:03:11.30
Here's Kufa. This is a little flare up.

2281
03:03:11.86 --> 03:03:14.82
If you want to know where they're hiding, they're in the cemetery over there.

2282
03:03:14.82 --> 03:03:18.58
And then you look on the maps on the wall and those are called exclusion zones.

2283
03:03:18.58 --> 03:03:20.58
You are not allowed to go inside of those.

2284
03:03:20.58 --> 03:03:21.86
Those are holy cities.

2285
03:03:21.86 --> 03:03:23.62
Those are holy things like this.

2286
03:03:23.62 --> 03:03:31.62
And I can remember Colonel John Mayer, who was just sitting there at the table one day and he's like,

2287
03:03:31.62 --> 03:03:35.38
well, I'm doing it. Don't take a genius to figure out where they're at.

2288
03:03:35.38 --> 03:03:37.70
He's the guy named, we're all the reds at.

2289
03:03:38.26 --> 03:03:40.66
And then the army left.

2290
03:03:41.22 --> 03:03:45.30
And when they left, we developed kind of a battle plan to

2291
03:03:45.30 --> 03:03:52.66
encroach upon those areas with tactical probes to make sure to draw them out

2292
03:03:52.90 --> 03:03:56.98
because the police stations and other plays that we were reinforcing were real close to this

2293
03:03:56.98 --> 03:04:00.82
around there. Real close to Kufa, real close to Saunders areas.

2294
03:04:00.82 --> 03:04:05.86
One, you're putting them in check on the chess board to do that while you're still maneuvering your elements.

2295
03:04:05.86 --> 03:04:09.62
And then August 5th was a typical day.

2296
03:04:09.62 --> 03:04:18.26
We were up late that night, the night before and August 5th they start doing a run on an Iraqi police station.

2297
03:04:18.26 --> 03:04:20.82
That's right across the street from Revolutionary Square.

2298
03:04:21.62 --> 03:04:28.10
And my people happen to be in the city, in these platoons, in these reinforce police stations.

2299
03:04:29.22 --> 03:04:31.14
And then before you knew it, the call came over.

2300
03:04:31.70 --> 03:04:37.46
Again, blackhawk down. We've got a UH1 that's crashed in Revolutionary Square.

2301
03:04:37.46 --> 03:04:42.18
Now we need to move in to do the crash site. And it's just, you're sitting there going.

2302
03:04:42.82 --> 03:04:44.58
You're watching the dominoes fall again.

2303
03:04:45.78 --> 03:04:49.38
Now they're over running a police station. They're taking more aggressive actions.

2304
03:04:49.38 --> 03:04:53.70
And then finally, the most blessed thing outside of just sitting there getting mortar

2305
03:04:53.70 --> 03:04:57.62
for no reason whatsoever going put. It's just going to be somewhere the same.

2306
03:04:59.46 --> 03:05:03.94
Get on the phone and the commander and everybody else is.

2307
03:05:03.94 --> 03:05:08.10
The UH's loosened zone now is the mosque.

2308
03:05:08.10 --> 03:05:12.42
It's in the center of that. Prepare the forces we're moving in to the cemetery.

2309
03:05:12.42 --> 03:05:14.10
And we're going to prosecute these things.

2310
03:05:15.14 --> 03:05:18.50
Jockel again, it's 1600 in the afternoon.

2311
03:05:19.30 --> 03:05:21.06
Temperature on the ground's 130.

2312
03:05:21.70 --> 03:05:25.06
You're away from the vibe, 14 miles with all whatever you have.

2313
03:05:25.62 --> 03:05:32.58
And now you just got an order. The order is we want you to push 1,400 meters through that cemetery

2314
03:05:32.58 --> 03:05:37.54
by tomorrow morning because I have a rifle company of 162 Marines that are here.

2315
03:05:38.66 --> 03:05:43.86
And I don't have any machine guns because they're out at the fob on fob security

2316
03:05:43.86 --> 03:05:49.46
because nobody thought that this battle was going to kick off. So they're up on post one, post two,

2317
03:05:49.46 --> 03:05:54.90
post three, the recon platoon's not being used. They're just over in their tents that are here.

2318
03:05:54.90 --> 03:05:59.14
And we're in a city. And we start pushing in on August 5th.

2319
03:05:59.14 --> 03:06:07.14
Within a matter of 100 yards of monsolyems, grips, no roads.

2320
03:06:07.14 --> 03:06:11.14
Anything else like this? And the road, the only road was in one that was at your back

2321
03:06:11.14 --> 03:06:14.10
that you just crossed to get in there. So that's your supply line.

2322
03:06:14.10 --> 03:06:16.50
You lose this or you lose something.

2323
03:06:17.30 --> 03:06:22.02
And all of a sudden you start getting people getting shot from behind

2324
03:06:22.42 --> 03:06:27.22
that are moving through this because 1,400 meters, you can't move that fast.

2325
03:06:27.22 --> 03:06:30.82
Matt Morsey, great hunter looked at me.

2326
03:06:31.94 --> 03:06:37.14
What do you think of this? We pushed as far as we could that night and then through the center of this

2327
03:06:37.14 --> 03:06:44.82
gigantic cemetery is this thing called a diagonal road. And back in the NewDies or 90s, Saddam who

2328
03:06:44.82 --> 03:06:50.58
sane thought it'd be cool to take a bulldozer and plow through some of these graves of people

2329
03:06:50.58 --> 03:06:56.98
he didn't care for too much and make this road through there as a big FU to them I'm in charge.

2330
03:06:58.34 --> 03:07:02.34
We got our backs to that road and made a tactic to a decision.

2331
03:07:02.90 --> 03:07:07.38
This is where we're going to hold the line tonight because now I can bring tanks into that road.

2332
03:07:07.38 --> 03:07:12.82
Now we just let 50 yards onto the field. We don't need this one. And now we can actually start

2333
03:07:12.82 --> 03:07:18.42
bringing the more reinforcements and load them up onto here. So we're sitting on that diagonal road

2334
03:07:18.42 --> 03:07:27.78
in these grips all night. Fighting this operations from you couldn't know where you were at,

2335
03:07:28.18 --> 03:07:33.38
you're getting mordered, they're dropping on with 82s, they're walking them on top and then you're

2336
03:07:33.38 --> 03:07:38.10
just kind of sitting there and then you're going in and out and throwing fry grenades down into

2337
03:07:38.10 --> 03:07:43.06
the grips at your pass on them. And then at times kind of like a tunnel rat in the nomb, you're

2338
03:07:43.06 --> 03:07:47.54
also following this stuff because those catacomes started connecting under that cemetery.

2339
03:07:47.54 --> 03:07:53.46
With these individuals. So you're stripping off things, you're stripping off armor,

2340
03:07:53.46 --> 03:07:58.42
small guys, knee, you're rocking up pistol, you're doing around, you're launching a grenade,

2341
03:07:58.42 --> 03:08:04.42
you're following that. You know, you got people coming up, two to the chest, whatever you have to do.

2342
03:08:04.42 --> 03:08:09.30
And then you're leapfrogging all the way through the cemetery to get to that and hold that line.

2343
03:08:10.02 --> 03:08:13.22
And then that night we really didn't know what the situation was.

2344
03:08:13.22 --> 03:08:18.74
And we ended Jason Platoon, get mordered, drop right on their CP.

2345
03:08:19.70 --> 03:08:24.50
So I ran down through the cemetery, Lieutenant Lewis, a few other ones blinded,

2346
03:08:25.14 --> 03:08:28.90
the tawn there, there was some other ones that were killed in the blast.

2347
03:08:29.94 --> 03:08:34.42
And this is at night and then all of a sudden we're trying to figure out, I wonder where we're at.

2348
03:08:36.34 --> 03:08:40.82
So somebody came up with a great idea which I believe was the four deer controller.

2349
03:08:40.82 --> 03:08:46.42
We're going to get a pilot to buzz the cemetery. They will never lay off of a target like that.

2350
03:08:46.98 --> 03:08:51.94
So when that pilot comes through, they're firing red tracers. Yeah, there's weapons.

2351
03:08:53.06 --> 03:08:58.10
When that, when I came down about 200 meters, blazing, whatever 100 knots that was on that,

2352
03:08:58.50 --> 03:09:03.06
it looked like something out of Star Wars coming up there. Red tracers were everywhere

2353
03:09:03.94 --> 03:09:08.42
back front front and it was kind of like that comment that Chester Puller made and it's not

2354
03:09:08.42 --> 03:09:13.14
like, well good, we know we know we're that, you know they have us surrounded and now we can fight

2355
03:09:13.14 --> 03:09:18.74
in any direction. You kind of know where you're at. And then we were in that position on the fifth,

2356
03:09:18.74 --> 03:09:23.78
sixth, the seventh, fight and do that position. The next day I lost lands corporate wells from a

2357
03:09:23.78 --> 03:09:31.62
sniper through the right through his collar that was on there. So I believe it was a dragon off

2358
03:09:31.62 --> 03:09:36.10
from what I could see because the collar is a way made for fragmentation as you know, not to stop

2359
03:09:36.10 --> 03:09:42.26
a direct round that was coming through. But we had to carry that out and get him out of the cemetery.

2360
03:09:43.70 --> 03:09:48.90
Then we get pulled back out, rest in refit, this kind of fight continued to happen. The probing

2361
03:09:48.90 --> 03:09:54.42
continued to happen, the night time patrols back down into the cemetery. Now other reinforcements

2362
03:09:54.42 --> 03:10:00.58
from other units from D Winniea and all that are all collapsing onto what is kind of now the

2363
03:10:00.58 --> 03:10:06.18
pre-fallusia, because the same one started to move up north in November to take care of that.

2364
03:10:07.22 --> 03:10:12.34
And this goes on and then that leads us to our very weird connection that you just mentioned

2365
03:10:12.34 --> 03:10:19.46
solder before, of being on August 10th and getting a mission with an army, Delta unit to go in,

2366
03:10:20.18 --> 03:10:27.62
to take solder's house in one area and then the solder school was in another section.

2367
03:10:27.62 --> 03:10:34.50
And Mass Arnuch and forced went into the school and the hopped up in surgeons were at the second row

2368
03:10:34.50 --> 03:10:38.66
of the school and they started growing Egyptian grenades down a ladder wells at the troops coming up.

2369
03:10:39.94 --> 03:10:46.50
And fragged the troops that were coming in. We get to call that we now have wounded marines inside

2370
03:10:46.50 --> 03:10:52.90
of the solder school into this middle. And we pull into position, a platoon sergeant, a Todd Boydston,

2371
03:10:52.90 --> 03:10:58.82
one of the best infantry staff sergeants I've ever seen, is standing there on this intersection

2372
03:10:58.82 --> 03:11:04.02
of this corner and there's this long axis of this wall and this building is inside of here.

2373
03:11:04.02 --> 03:11:09.94
So there's another access to the tier and these marines are bleeding out inside of here.

2374
03:11:09.94 --> 03:11:12.90
It just was hit with the Egyptian grenades rolling down the ladder well.

2375
03:11:14.74 --> 03:11:19.22
Rolled in, got the assessment of what that situation was and we didn't know,

2376
03:11:19.22 --> 03:11:23.86
you know, you don't know what you're going to see on the inside. It's about 100 meters away down there.

2377
03:11:24.74 --> 03:11:28.10
And so I just told Todd, it's the time, okay, here's what we're going to do.

2378
03:11:28.10 --> 03:11:34.42
I'm going to put the machine gunners on the corners of this direction. The roads about maybe

2379
03:11:34.42 --> 03:11:39.22
eight feet wide from wall to wall. We know where they're at. It's down there.

2380
03:11:40.26 --> 03:11:46.10
I'm going to run down the axis and hugged the wall on this side because what kept them from doing

2381
03:11:46.10 --> 03:11:51.22
that jacket was in the building. Overlooking that road was a sniper that kept the marines from being

2382
03:11:51.22 --> 03:11:56.90
able to evacuate the wounded out of the house. Another coordinated effort to trap them inside the

2383
03:11:56.90 --> 03:12:04.74
lower aspects. So kind of on my mark, I'm going to run hug the wall this year and I'm going to

2384
03:12:04.74 --> 03:12:09.78
get in and hopefully the guys going to shoot and miss the machine gunners are going to see

2385
03:12:09.78 --> 03:12:14.42
where that came from and they're going to kill that sniper or fix that position in the building.

2386
03:12:14.42 --> 03:12:21.70
Long enough to keep his head down to get in, triage, assess and then tell him on the video on

2387
03:12:21.70 --> 03:12:26.90
your R. We're going to throw a hang grenade because our hang grenades sound differently than

2388
03:12:26.90 --> 03:12:32.18
theirs do. Big large swamp. We're going to throw a hang grenade when you hear the hang grenade

2389
03:12:32.18 --> 03:12:37.86
go off. Todd, have the machine gunners shift to the left wall and continue to still lay

2390
03:12:37.86 --> 03:12:42.90
lead into that building. We are going to bring the casualties hugging the right wall about eight

2391
03:12:42.90 --> 03:12:47.46
feet away from them, of where they're at and get these guys out of the building. I'm going to

2392
03:12:47.46 --> 03:12:55.62
run that action on Humpen probably from flash to bang within a 12 minute period in and out of

2393
03:12:55.62 --> 03:13:00.58
not pre coordination before first sergeants are supposed to be door breaches or something that

2394
03:13:00.58 --> 03:13:05.86
actually does that but at the time you just kind of think, I'm really kind of the most expendable

2395
03:13:05.86 --> 03:13:11.46
person here. You have a job, you have a job, you have a job, you're doing your job. I just rolled

2396
03:13:11.46 --> 03:13:16.98
up into here. I bring your food, water, child, ammunition, everything else and primarily the job

2397
03:13:16.98 --> 03:13:23.14
is to get them boys out of life. So you just want to do work like a champ. One of the one of

2398
03:13:23.14 --> 03:13:27.38
the things picked it up and showed me a few years ago, I had no idea that the company clerk

2399
03:13:27.38 --> 03:13:33.70
had filmed the entire thing from the hood of the army that was on that and blogger that was out

2400
03:13:33.70 --> 03:13:39.30
there named Funker. I'm going to put that up and posted that that was online a few years ago

2401
03:13:39.30 --> 03:13:43.30
and it's time of the year again. It's kind of one of those things. It's really hard to

2402
03:13:44.02 --> 03:13:47.54
it's kind of hard to watch but you're happy that everybody we didn't lose anybody on that.

2403
03:13:48.42 --> 03:13:53.78
The Marines didn't on that when the army did. The army special forces take loss or master

2404
03:13:53.78 --> 03:13:57.06
sergeant when they went in and they took it meaning going in that and came out.

2405
03:13:58.18 --> 03:14:03.06
Yeah, that's actually posted on YouTube that whole scenario. You said he filmed everything.

2406
03:14:03.06 --> 03:14:07.46
He filmed almost everything because at one point he must be getting some stray rounds because

2407
03:14:07.46 --> 03:14:12.26
he drops the camera and takes cover for a second before he gets back up to get the rest of it.

2408
03:14:12.26 --> 03:14:18.34
Yeah, he's a funicat. He's a really good every Marine arrive a moment, every Marine arrive a

2409
03:14:18.34 --> 03:14:22.10
moment. I mean, he was an infantryman. There was a cup on the clerk but by God,

2410
03:14:23.70 --> 03:14:28.18
when the round hit over his head or whatever, I've had a good look at that one time and had a good

2411
03:14:28.18 --> 03:14:33.30
laugh like you did of the camera drops for a while and he's to pick it back up and stabilize that.

2412
03:14:33.30 --> 03:14:40.34
You know, you also told me a little bit about when you guys were clearing some of those underground

2413
03:14:40.34 --> 03:14:46.50
spots and you had, I think you said it was a Lance Corporal rolling into one of these situations and

2414
03:14:46.50 --> 03:14:54.74
does up in a hand-to-hand combat with an insurgent. What happened there? This is on August 25th.

2415
03:14:55.62 --> 03:15:01.30
We're now preparing for the assault on an around the Amaman Lee shrine.

2416
03:15:01.30 --> 03:15:07.94
There's an NFA, a 400 meters, it's around the shrine but we're now going to push with

2417
03:15:07.94 --> 03:15:12.98
infantry and Am tracks and make this big push and kind of drive them into the shrine and

2418
03:15:12.98 --> 03:15:18.66
contain them. That was in there. And then every night, bringing the spooky kunship to circle that

2419
03:15:18.66 --> 03:15:24.98
and contain them even more. That was from it. It was beautiful. So on August 25th, that roughly

2420
03:15:24.98 --> 03:15:33.22
about 2230 at night, we inserted a couple of infantry companies. In 1st of 5th, 4th,

2421
03:15:33.22 --> 03:15:39.78
Marines, Charlie was mine, Alpha and Bravo were the other two. Bravo wasn't on the initial insert,

2422
03:15:39.78 --> 03:15:47.46
but Alpha was off to our left. And we go to the top and we are tasked with inserting the infantry

2423
03:15:47.46 --> 03:15:53.70
into this place. It's like a three-story hotel and it looks like something you would have seen in

2424
03:15:53.70 --> 03:15:59.46
Bay Route blasted in everything else in there. So it's the critical position that holds an intersection

2425
03:16:00.02 --> 03:16:06.18
that allows us observation down these long accesses to get access to the Amaman Lee shrine.

2426
03:16:08.82 --> 03:16:14.90
2230, my second Paton, enters the first layer of the building. PFC Ryan Colin Ward

2427
03:16:14.90 --> 03:16:20.90
is one of the first men in the stack. He goes in the long half and he sees an opening on the right

2428
03:16:20.90 --> 03:16:27.86
hand side when he goes in and now he's under night vision. He's fully loaded out and he looks to the

2429
03:16:27.86 --> 03:16:33.62
right and he sees even in night vision and an insurgent coming out of the basement of the hotel

2430
03:16:33.62 --> 03:16:40.98
with an RPG on his shoulder walking up the stairs. Colin Ward was an grenade that's fracked

2431
03:16:40.98 --> 03:16:46.10
already getting ready to prep and throw that was here. That instantaneous thing kicks over.

2432
03:16:46.10 --> 03:16:50.26
So it's a way so he was going into the room and he was ready to hook a grenade.

2433
03:16:50.26 --> 03:16:55.06
But he wasn't ready to do it that way. He was so he had to grenade in his hand.

2434
03:16:55.78 --> 03:16:59.94
Pin already pulled and he's ready to go because they're going to frag the room. That's around the

2435
03:16:59.94 --> 03:17:06.98
thing. Somehow, in the audience, he gets that off in a way. Has a situational awareness to still

2436
03:17:06.98 --> 03:17:11.78
bring it in the direction they're supposed to go and he rolls right.

2437
03:17:12.90 --> 03:17:18.74
Starts down that stairs makes it about three steps. Slings his rifle behind him, jumps off the

2438
03:17:18.74 --> 03:17:25.94
top step. Tackles the insurgent with the RPG rolls down another flight of steps into that basement

2439
03:17:25.94 --> 03:17:32.02
and then all you could hear is that insurgent screaming. When Colin Ward was taking a bayonet

2440
03:17:32.02 --> 03:17:38.66
to him in moral combat in a dark basement, why he's got MBGs on his head. 19 years old.

2441
03:17:39.78 --> 03:17:47.62
Kills the insurgent brings the RPG back upstairs and then goes on to continue to clear the building

2442
03:17:47.62 --> 03:17:52.74
with the rest of the squad. We were in the building from the 25th to the 28th. By the time that the

2443
03:17:52.74 --> 03:17:58.26
recon platoon that came in after us a very good friend of mine retired master gun resort and Brian

2444
03:17:58.26 --> 03:18:04.02
Yarlum brought this platoon in. They came in and then went down and cleared the rest of the basement.

2445
03:18:04.90 --> 03:18:09.94
Not only was that one dead in search and down there, there was another insurgent that wasn't there

2446
03:18:09.94 --> 03:18:15.14
with Colin Ward because he was cowering behind a ladder well watching his buddy get killed by a

2447
03:18:15.14 --> 03:18:20.26
US Marine and then he got taken out by the recon platoon that came in on the backside.

2448
03:18:20.26 --> 03:18:26.82
Surgeically did that because Colin Ward's platoon is now going up the ladder well to chase the

2449
03:18:26.82 --> 03:18:32.74
other insurgents up to the third level and they're pinning them up there or squad automatic weapons

2450
03:18:32.74 --> 03:18:38.50
and everything else did their job and they cleared that entire soil element and it's the same time

2451
03:18:38.50 --> 03:18:44.66
you're on the radio right outside. I go in your hearing we just took a casual. You're hearing we

2452
03:18:44.66 --> 03:18:49.78
just lost Colin Ward because he just went that way right and you hear the screaming and that's

2453
03:18:49.78 --> 03:18:54.74
going on here and then you're hearing another Marine just fell down the elevator shaft.

2454
03:18:54.74 --> 03:19:00.18
It was here and it's an old burned-out elevator shaft that still got rebars sticking out of it

2455
03:19:00.18 --> 03:19:07.22
and Lance Colt-Polwashmirm was stuck down there on that rebore. He's on nods as well. I mean

2456
03:19:07.22 --> 03:19:11.94
you're looking down a dark elevator shaft got I thought within two seconds I just lost

2457
03:19:11.94 --> 03:19:16.42
the first two Marines it just went into the building. Both of them survived and we're out of there.

2458
03:19:16.42 --> 03:19:22.18
We got him washman out of the elevator shaft. Column Ward went on to do some more great things

2459
03:19:22.18 --> 03:19:27.46
in the fight all the way through to 28th and then roughly about to 28th is when Alsaad

2460
03:19:27.46 --> 03:19:34.34
came in and broke her to Procadup Supposedly Peace Deal that called for the ceasefire and then that

2461
03:19:34.34 --> 03:19:45.86
day was surreal because then we had just in a matter of two hours we had to then watch everybody

2462
03:19:45.86 --> 03:19:51.14
take their rocky rockets and donkey carts and move them across the street and you can't shoot

2463
03:19:51.14 --> 03:19:56.42
anybody here's what this is. So you set up these roadblocks and these things and you're just watching

2464
03:19:56.42 --> 03:20:01.94
a move they're weaponry from one side of the city to the other and you still know this is something

2465
03:20:01.94 --> 03:20:09.86
these going to have to do something about this but then we had people who were actually

2466
03:20:11.38 --> 03:20:17.54
detainees and they showed up with news media and in a regular rocky tone that you would always

2467
03:20:17.54 --> 03:20:22.26
here when you had some women to the mix and they start screaming and pointing and everything else

2468
03:20:22.26 --> 03:20:27.30
the news media starts saying you know there's the murderers there's the people who

2469
03:20:27.30 --> 03:20:34.18
desecrated our bodies and who are you talking about so you come over and what I didn't tell you before

2470
03:20:34.18 --> 03:20:40.66
jogger was the dead bodies that were in the building never left the building because for the next

2471
03:20:40.66 --> 03:20:45.86
couple of days Marines couldn't get out the building because of the snipers to keep them in the building

2472
03:20:46.82 --> 03:20:51.78
so it was very dangerous as exposure head or anything else to do that and we'd maneuver through these

2473
03:20:51.78 --> 03:21:00.26
channels out there and it was making the Marine sick these bodies are just decomposing two of

2474
03:21:00.26 --> 03:21:04.58
one of the basement a couple of upstairs all that it was here and it got to the point where I

2475
03:21:04.58 --> 03:21:09.94
walked past a battlefield position one day and saw a Marine with a green skivisher around his face

2476
03:21:09.94 --> 03:21:17.46
wet and it had probably 500 flies on his face on that thing from those bodies and I had called

2477
03:21:17.46 --> 03:21:24.10
over to again Colonel John Mayer back at the problem and had requested like 20 gallons of gasoline

2478
03:21:25.06 --> 03:21:30.26
and he asked me where you could do it to gasoline and how a burner can't part of it well and

2479
03:21:30.26 --> 03:21:36.66
thank God he goes to whatever you do man don't burn up right because he probably had more of a

2480
03:21:37.78 --> 03:21:43.70
top level view or maybe what that would have looked like if it was here I don't know but I still

2481
03:21:43.70 --> 03:21:51.30
have the problem you're not going to give the problem still exists what do we need to do grab blankets

2482
03:21:53.06 --> 03:21:58.10
shove Vaseline up in whom he's noses put everything else the corpsman start doing that and then we

2483
03:21:58.10 --> 03:22:02.58
talk of these dead bodies into these things put the machine gunners and people on the roof

2484
03:22:02.58 --> 03:22:08.82
to pin the snipers down and run those net Iraqi bodies across the street and put them in a house

2485
03:22:08.82 --> 03:22:14.66
when I put them in a house so this is another thing that I don't really like to tolerate about

2486
03:22:14.66 --> 03:22:18.50
all these people that they try to paint US troops is they're just barbarians that are

2487
03:22:19.30 --> 03:22:24.50
put them in a house pull them in the house and actually when they put them down inside the house

2488
03:22:24.50 --> 03:22:32.18
I said face their heads towards Maka they were fighters they you know people call them shit

2489
03:22:32.18 --> 03:22:36.66
heads or they were hopped up they were in search or whatever I have a little bit of a respect

2490
03:22:36.66 --> 03:22:42.90
of another human being I may not believe in what you're doing but he picked up a rifle he did

2491
03:22:42.90 --> 03:22:47.54
whatever he was going to do for whatever that guy believed in and was trying to kill me and on the

2492
03:22:47.54 --> 03:22:53.94
field about or we just got one up on him that was here so put them inside of there turn them

2493
03:22:53.94 --> 03:23:00.18
cover them with this pile of rocks that was there because the wild dogs start to go through there

2494
03:23:00.18 --> 03:23:05.46
and then over the next 24 hours that's all you heard all night was the wild dogs beating their head

2495
03:23:05.46 --> 03:23:10.34
to get into that building to start tearing at the bodies then the next morning these same

2496
03:23:10.34 --> 03:23:14.90
landscourt rules that you're seeing that made you start that in the first place you're seeing

2497
03:23:14.90 --> 03:23:19.62
them just go like would you look at that and you see a dog rolled down the street like with a foot

2498
03:23:19.62 --> 03:23:26.50
hanging out of its mouth like it's nobody's business right and then this news media is here

2499
03:23:27.38 --> 03:23:34.82
and all of a sudden these dogs have torn at those bodies now the story is the marines mutilated

2500
03:23:34.82 --> 03:23:40.74
the bodies they allowed the dogs to desecrate them bad bad bad bad rolled up and told them

2501
03:23:40.74 --> 03:23:46.10
through the interpreter you look at the way their heads are facing those individuals are dropped

2502
03:23:46.10 --> 03:23:51.94
there out of respect at their own lives these individuals took them across and put them in the

2503
03:23:51.94 --> 03:23:58.66
chattering stop you know it just stopped they instantly knew and then we went about one of them

2504
03:23:58.66 --> 03:24:04.10
started pointing about a hundred yards away interpreter comes up what's he saying he said we're

2505
03:24:04.10 --> 03:24:11.30
missing a body is over there I'm like how does he know these are there probably because he was

2506
03:24:11.30 --> 03:24:15.70
with him when that guy was killed walk behind another rock power hundred meters away

2507
03:24:15.70 --> 03:24:19.94
dead and surge my end right over there because he was probably spotting or something with them

2508
03:24:19.94 --> 03:24:25.70
these kids were 17 18 that was on that popped up in the ambulance pulled him off down the street

2509
03:24:25.70 --> 03:24:32.98
you know international incident circumvented by kind of not desecrating or not doing what you're

2510
03:24:32.98 --> 03:24:38.82
you know a lot of people may not even blame you got it animosity you're amped up you're doing this

2511
03:24:38.82 --> 03:24:44.66
but you trained them differently to say that you know these kind of things in the past

2512
03:24:45.46 --> 03:24:51.14
only actually and boldened the culture when you do that to somebody to fight them even harder

2513
03:24:51.14 --> 03:24:55.94
imagine somebody coming in and mutilating your mother or doing something after that and you believe

2514
03:24:55.94 --> 03:25:00.74
that that's going to suppress you and amount of hatred to not want to go and do whatever you can

2515
03:25:00.74 --> 03:25:06.18
to do that so all those little steps along the way of a of a 162 guys of a rifle company

2516
03:25:07.94 --> 03:25:12.90
you know you watch a band of brothers and then you're sitting here going man in 2004

2517
03:25:13.46 --> 03:25:17.86
I wouldn't part of the five of those parish unit infantry by a de Bestem American

2518
03:25:17.86 --> 03:25:20.90
in America so we're seeing since that time frame in this city

2519
03:25:20.90 --> 03:25:31.38
once that piece deal I don't know what else to call it cease fire deal was brokered

2520
03:25:31.38 --> 03:25:37.94
what was arrested at the point of like it was now just going through the city and doing reparations

2521
03:25:37.94 --> 03:25:43.14
payments through the city and we would set up things on a Monday that was probably even more dangerous

2522
03:25:43.14 --> 03:25:52.18
than combat because they you'd bring them to the same place same day same time they would line up

2523
03:25:52.18 --> 03:25:55.86
you'd be driving through the city and you'd do talking knocks on there

2524
03:25:56.98 --> 03:26:01.78
are you claiming any damage that the Americans did on your house or did you lose this on

2525
03:26:01.78 --> 03:26:06.98
and combat did you do something like this then that's where you find out how they fabricate

2526
03:26:06.98 --> 03:26:10.66
multiple desertificates and they're trying to get money from the Americans and

2527
03:26:10.66 --> 03:26:16.26
it was just it was a lot of that it was then a lot of going back into the town

2528
03:26:16.98 --> 03:26:20.18
to then again say that you know we don't want to fight

2529
03:26:20.98 --> 03:26:25.86
meaning if you will give you a fight if you want it but let's kind of get back to

2530
03:26:26.26 --> 03:26:32.42
doing what it was we were here to stabilize this and help you out and then this is the beginning

2531
03:26:32.42 --> 03:26:38.34
you know of what turned out to be that led into you in remodding and the

2532
03:26:38.34 --> 03:26:43.94
assuming you know and everything else I mean this is the impancy of the next two years

2533
03:26:43.94 --> 03:26:49.70
like you would said jago I'll call it a peace day or whatever because more casualties in

2534
03:26:49.70 --> 03:26:54.66
sustained combat in major level happen and immediately after that in the next two years

2535
03:26:55.06 --> 03:27:02.66
all throughout that region and it didn't stabilize it it was there and still not stable today

2536
03:27:02.66 --> 03:27:10.34
you get home from that deployment and what's next this when your recon career starts this is

2537
03:27:10.34 --> 03:27:17.38
this is when I like to say that I got to serve in a reconnaissance unit being a marine

2538
03:27:17.38 --> 03:27:21.94
and a reconnaissance unit was one of the proudest Marines not being a recon marine

2539
03:27:22.58 --> 03:27:28.02
because just because you're in somebody's unit doesn't mean that you're the person that's the

2540
03:27:28.02 --> 03:27:34.18
cats but that's inside of that and I didn't go with a Lance Cooper to do selection assessment I

2541
03:27:34.18 --> 03:27:38.90
didn't go through the things that those guys had to do I was a first-sorten it was happy to be in

2542
03:27:38.90 --> 03:27:44.90
the infantry but that master gunnery sergeant I told you about in that recon platoon that was just

2543
03:27:44.90 --> 03:27:51.30
sitting out on a bob doing nothing along with my machine gunners and that's how I found them

2544
03:27:51.30 --> 03:27:58.50
went out of that city when we were running casualties and 14 miles away was the element

2545
03:27:58.50 --> 03:28:04.82
of the mue headquarters out of a place called fob duke I rolled into post one all the way to the CP

2546
03:28:06.18 --> 03:28:15.30
and when we set the casualties over to get treated at the main BDS I was there I always taught

2547
03:28:15.30 --> 03:28:20.10
the Marines if you ever take a vehicle back to the rear you do not bring it back to the front empty

2548
03:28:20.10 --> 03:28:27.78
ammunition food water whatever you have so the same guy that filmed the thing called Chris it was in there

2549
03:28:29.06 --> 03:28:33.94
washes the blood out the vehicles he does the things he goes over the KBR representatives which

2550
03:28:33.94 --> 03:28:41.06
were actually really great there was no 801 12 apples or anything else guy would unlock an entire

2551
03:28:41.06 --> 03:28:46.18
ISO container and go you take what you want first and then just sign off the whole ISO container or

2552
03:28:46.18 --> 03:28:51.46
whatever whatever they had to do but it wasn't you can't have this not fresh fruit or whatever you can

2553
03:28:51.46 --> 03:28:58.50
do get it back in their trolls up I go over in the main CP and I get called up there because somebody

2554
03:28:58.50 --> 03:29:04.66
finds out I just brought casualties back into your we're going to go back into the city and when we

2555
03:29:04.66 --> 03:29:11.86
made that 14 thing with a shot out windscreen Chris who is not a home V driver or a license to

2556
03:29:11.86 --> 03:29:18.66
on be driver right I told him get in the vehicle and get ready to drive and I had four flat tires

2557
03:29:18.66 --> 03:29:24.98
on run flats and he spun that vehicle around on that diagonal road so I could load landscopable

2558
03:29:24.98 --> 03:29:30.90
Brooks with the sucking chest wound on August 6 ended the back of that vehicle by past the

2559
03:29:30.90 --> 03:29:35.38
four were casually collection point because his kids got a sucking chest wounds I laid on Brooks

2560
03:29:35.38 --> 03:29:41.62
in the back of the vehicle and told Chris to drive that vehicle like he stole it because he used

2561
03:29:41.62 --> 03:29:46.90
to be this kid I had one these little souped up Subaru and he got to Los Angeles on his free time

2562
03:29:46.90 --> 03:29:52.58
and maybe do some street racing in the face so it's kind of knowing your marines in the rough time

2563
03:29:52.58 --> 03:29:59.06
how it benefits the skills that you can have I know you can drive get in there he calls off and we

2564
03:29:59.06 --> 03:30:04.90
get in there and drop the casual I get called over because I call my gun or he's sorry it's on

2565
03:30:04.90 --> 03:30:10.82
the fab that's left back with my weapons puttone and said go over to this other unit tell

2566
03:30:10.82 --> 03:30:14.90
all my need the machine gunners tell them they're going to need to put people up in those

2567
03:30:14.90 --> 03:30:19.54
things to do this and we're taking on machine gunners and we're going back in a city with these

2568
03:30:19.54 --> 03:30:26.42
guys I knew I'd be there by now all that machine guns came out loaded up we're all rolling

2569
03:30:26.42 --> 03:30:32.90
in a city before we rolled out I took him out went back in the city jackel had to make another

2570
03:30:32.90 --> 03:30:39.46
run that was back out and somehow a lieutenant colonel was up with the mu headquarters and come

2571
03:30:39.46 --> 03:30:45.78
in and he had said if that SOB gets back on here again I want to see before it goes out

2572
03:30:46.98 --> 03:30:53.54
love him to death lieutenant colonel johnson I walked up in there still covered going from head to toe

2573
03:30:54.66 --> 03:31:01.94
and he was carrying like an MP5 on his back and he grabbed me got real close and he was like

2574
03:31:01.94 --> 03:31:09.62
personally you you get so over here and we're at like 40 50 people in a CP and he goes open you

2575
03:31:09.62 --> 03:31:16.18
reduce the the strength of this fighting position is out here took those machine guns that was

2576
03:31:16.18 --> 03:31:22.58
off here to do that and I was I was just standing out and like I need machine guns that are done

2577
03:31:22.58 --> 03:31:27.46
these are my boys they're on here I coordinated with this other unit to do that they're going to

2578
03:31:27.46 --> 03:31:32.66
watch these posts they've been standing guard before for over here to do that right and he just

2579
03:31:32.66 --> 03:31:37.70
kind of looked at me kind of shook his head he's an infantryman it was like

2580
03:31:39.78 --> 03:31:45.78
I think and then just can you have really big hug and set best of luck when you roll out of

2581
03:31:45.78 --> 03:31:50.82
your down ass city man you do what you gotta do we'll take this carry out and then a yellow

2582
03:31:50.82 --> 03:31:56.82
topping once if you ever do that again I will make sure that you're not going to be in the marines

2583
03:31:56.82 --> 03:32:04.42
very long because he did the right he in the end the right thing is done in that chaotic situation

2584
03:32:04.42 --> 03:32:10.34
that is there that's laid out before you you don't have hours you don't have things it's reactionary

2585
03:32:10.34 --> 03:32:18.90
you're saving your losing lives to do that pretty beautiful thing and then how how to that lead to

2586
03:32:19.38 --> 03:32:25.30
you get an attached to the recon unit the guy that I remember to do I got the guy I remember me

2587
03:32:25.30 --> 03:32:31.46
getting him out of the tent and saying I need a provisional rifle put on to beef us up down there

2588
03:32:31.46 --> 03:32:39.46
and the recon officer and the gunnery sergeant came up and said we'll do that job just get us

2589
03:32:39.46 --> 03:32:45.30
into fight we roll them out made the request recon mounts up they end up being a provisional rifle

2590
03:32:45.30 --> 03:32:50.50
put on and a recon put on attached to us I'm their first sergeant we get done with that entire

2591
03:32:50.50 --> 03:32:56.82
thing that was there jaco I get back up or done with the deployment I get a phone call from first

2592
03:32:56.82 --> 03:33:04.66
recon battalion you ever thought about coming to recon see here like yeah because that's what I wanted

2593
03:33:04.66 --> 03:33:10.10
to do when I came in but they also told me when I was a Lance Corp. because after you get in even

2594
03:33:10.10 --> 03:33:14.66
if you're an amtrak you can try out you do that but you couldn't if you were a colored one

2595
03:33:14.66 --> 03:33:20.42
there I couldn't do that so it's one of those things where you find a way and it might not be

2596
03:33:20.42 --> 03:33:26.42
this year might be some year that was the way said absolutely sergeant made your game me a call

2597
03:33:26.42 --> 03:33:31.06
he said show up down here in the pool deck about three fifteen in the morning bring your PT shorts

2598
03:33:31.06 --> 03:33:36.74
bring your things down here getting a pool do some things run a PFT that was over here do a

2599
03:33:36.74 --> 03:33:40.74
little bit of an interview brought some people down in and it's a tail end of the thing he said

2600
03:33:40.74 --> 03:33:45.86
I'd just like to be a first sergeant here recon battalion tonight I'd absolutely love that job

2601
03:33:45.86 --> 03:33:50.18
and he goes okay consider it done go back up I've already called your sergeant major up there

2602
03:33:50.18 --> 03:33:54.82
before you even said yes you're coming back here went up to first battalion fourth Marine

2603
03:33:54.82 --> 03:34:02.26
same thing back my stuff went down there and spent from the year of 2005 to 2010

2604
03:34:02.82 --> 03:34:09.06
as the first sergeant for company eight mostly that was there restarted up a company of

2605
03:34:09.06 --> 03:34:14.26
Delta Company that was a Vietnam existence this is when the force recon platoons that were

2606
03:34:14.26 --> 03:34:18.82
meth assets were then put back down into battions so they start showing up to tier

2607
03:34:18.82 --> 03:34:24.42
rebuilding a pretty good force then about two thousand seven I got asked to stay on to be the

2608
03:34:24.42 --> 03:34:31.38
sergeant major that unit and was the sergeant major from 07 to 10 up in the center armout

2609
03:34:31.38 --> 03:34:37.70
and range operating out of Alessad it was there control on the rat lines coming up with the

2610
03:34:37.70 --> 03:34:43.30
ZD's had some really good mission sets that were out of there about the eight nine time frame

2611
03:34:44.58 --> 03:34:49.94
and then what it what did you do when you were done with that once I was done with that one I went back to be

2612
03:34:49.94 --> 03:34:56.02
the sergeant major for about a year at the Amtrak Schoolhouse that I grew up in as a kid it was there

2613
03:34:56.98 --> 03:35:02.18
and then got to call asking me to pick a job because I wasn't going to leave you there

2614
03:35:03.06 --> 03:35:06.90
and they presented me with a couple options and they asked me one of one and I said I want to be

2615
03:35:06.90 --> 03:35:11.78
a regimental infantry sergeant major and they said good to go pack your stuff you're going to go

2616
03:35:11.78 --> 03:35:17.78
to Hawaii to be the third marine regiment I'm like you can be kidding me I have a fifth marine's yeah

2617
03:35:17.78 --> 03:35:22.26
this other because at the time this regiment didn't have this really good and people didn't know

2618
03:35:22.26 --> 03:35:32.02
this history but I had asked for it because go in my head that regiment with aviation assets

2619
03:35:32.02 --> 03:35:36.82
engineering assets Amtrak assets most infantry regiments don't have those organic to the

2620
03:35:36.82 --> 03:35:44.02
round thing then you have the twenty you have the yeah the air wing that's out there a K-B-A as

2621
03:35:44.02 --> 03:35:50.10
well that your lift capacity that's all that you own canny away bay is the marine regiment

2622
03:35:50.10 --> 03:35:57.70
along that I figured and now we're doing this repivit to the Pacific and we're posturing on

2623
03:35:57.70 --> 03:36:03.94
keeping the Chinese at bay we're negotiating to open up Australia's more training areas I'm like

2624
03:36:03.94 --> 03:36:09.22
oh my god you are well you're supposed to be how do you like to be in charge of like the

2625
03:36:09.22 --> 03:36:13.30
biggest strike force in the middle of the Pacific it's out here I think that's a pretty good deal

2626
03:36:14.90 --> 03:36:19.38
one less infantry battalion than the rest and they cover the most ground it's out there in a

2627
03:36:19.38 --> 03:36:25.54
Pacific from northern China all the way to Darwin and best one of the best fighting regiments

2628
03:36:25.54 --> 03:36:31.22
it's story they're the China marines they're not they're not they're operations in China

2629
03:36:31.22 --> 03:36:38.98
fourth marines at the China marines but third marines has quite a legacy um and a legacy that

2630
03:36:38.98 --> 03:36:45.62
goes back to rawfiel paraulta legacy of these battions going in out of Afghanistan my rock

2631
03:36:45.62 --> 03:36:53.46
because when larger battions got longer to all ratios when you had one less battalion in a regiment

2632
03:36:53.46 --> 03:36:58.50
that usually has four that's in there plus what they have and you have three systematically they

2633
03:36:58.50 --> 03:37:03.54
have to deploy more it goes out so now you're kind of in charge of a regiment that's got

2634
03:37:04.18 --> 03:37:08.66
one of the highest deployment tempos and also like the highest divorce rate in the entire

2635
03:37:08.66 --> 03:37:14.34
United States Marine Corps because they live in paradise but they're never there you know the families

2636
03:37:14.34 --> 03:37:18.98
are on that island but their loved ones are out training and to do all you're training and why

2637
03:37:18.98 --> 03:37:25.14
you have to leave Hawaii to do it so on your dwell time like you had said before dwell in dwell

2638
03:37:25.14 --> 03:37:31.54
dwell for some places in the backyard as well and other places when you can't train in your backyard

2639
03:37:31.54 --> 03:37:37.30
you have to fly to California fly to the big island fly to do different things like that all

2640
03:37:37.30 --> 03:37:45.54
your dwell time then turns into training time then that's how long was that tour that was about two

2641
03:37:45.54 --> 03:37:50.66
and a half years and what is that what is that bring you after that they brought me up to a two

2642
03:37:50.66 --> 03:37:56.58
star command at training and education command for the US Marine Corps out of Quantico Virginia and that's

2643
03:37:56.58 --> 03:38:03.38
where eventually we figured finished out of up there and that was was that 30 years that was a 30 years

2644
03:38:05.46 --> 03:38:15.30
at what point did you start getting involved in history flight about 2019 time frame

2645
03:38:15.30 --> 03:38:23.62
um we got a package in the Marine Corps for an honorary Marine was a guy in the Mark Nilla

2646
03:38:24.34 --> 03:38:28.82
and we'd started reading through this package and the general officer that I worked for

2647
03:38:29.22 --> 03:38:34.66
was the guy that originally did the nomination when he was in charge of the Second Marine Division

2648
03:38:34.66 --> 03:38:41.22
and he was now the Ticom commanding general this comes in and general done for is going to make

2649
03:38:41.22 --> 03:38:46.82
this man an honorary Marine he wants us to do the ceremony so we go over the National Museum of the Marine

2650
03:38:46.82 --> 03:38:53.30
Corps Mark Nilla in his family comes up we host them for a couple of days and then we do the honorary

2651
03:38:53.30 --> 03:38:59.54
Marine ceremony and at that time the Marine Corps had given bestowed that honor to less than a hundred

2652
03:38:59.54 --> 03:39:05.22
people in the mornings it was a pretty big deal I didn't know when he did and I started reading this

2653
03:39:05.22 --> 03:39:15.62
dossier and it was an individual who was a pilot still a pilot for UPS and he used to

2654
03:39:16.82 --> 03:39:24.90
run this aircraft when it flew B-24s or a B-25 a couple A-86 Texans some other things like

2655
03:39:24.90 --> 03:39:30.18
air shows around the nation with some other pilots and they started lifting these veterans and

2656
03:39:30.18 --> 03:39:37.46
here in these veterans stories and his father was an amelitary and it goes on and on and he starts

2657
03:39:37.46 --> 03:39:41.38
funding some of these search and recovery type things with some of the money that they're getting from

2658
03:39:41.38 --> 03:39:47.46
that and then the housing industry kind of crushes the airplane ride industry and things like

2659
03:39:47.46 --> 03:39:52.90
this one people can't pay their mortgages they don't want to spend money to fly on a aircraft to do that

2660
03:39:54.10 --> 03:39:59.70
and so he kind of recocks and he starts doing some research and finds in his research

2661
03:39:59.70 --> 03:40:05.62
comes across a thing that says that in the Pacific Island campaign in Tarlah the Marines had

2662
03:40:05.62 --> 03:40:12.42
had 541 people roughly killed and they were left on the island that were out there and a majority

2663
03:40:12.42 --> 03:40:17.78
of them were never recovered and then as he starts researching more more he finds out this happened

2664
03:40:17.78 --> 03:40:24.26
in other places and he can't believe what he's saying so he starts kind of making inquiries the

2665
03:40:24.26 --> 03:40:30.66
research and he starts doing this and all the way through 910 1112 he starts making trips out to

2666
03:40:30.66 --> 03:40:37.86
Tarlah on his own funding in his own time and he goes out there and in the early years it was as

2667
03:40:37.86 --> 03:40:45.62
easy as people displaying macabre bones on their front porch at Tarlah one saying you know we told

2668
03:40:46.34 --> 03:40:51.78
we told people 25 years ago that these people were here they just never came in Goddham and then

2669
03:40:51.78 --> 03:40:57.14
she would say like but they're mine now because they've been here and you could tell that they were

2670
03:40:57.14 --> 03:41:02.34
Caucasian but the bones everything else it was on there and he starts taking those first two

2671
03:41:02.82 --> 03:41:07.46
turn them over for identification you start doing that and you start doing the investigating getting

2672
03:41:07.46 --> 03:41:15.06
more more and more by the time that I had went up with Mark Noah at that thing he had repatriated

2673
03:41:15.06 --> 03:41:25.30
and located I believe at the time at least about 70 marines that were lost and sailors also had recovered

2674
03:41:25.30 --> 03:41:33.30
a bomber crew that in 1944 had taken off from the runway in Tarlah and kind of made it just over

2675
03:41:33.30 --> 03:41:39.62
the lagoon and crashed into lagoon and then it also done some work in Europe on some bomber

2676
03:41:39.62 --> 03:41:45.30
p47 sites a few other things and I found it really fascinating because this is something all the way

2677
03:41:45.30 --> 03:41:50.98
back since I was teaching history in the Marine Corps and I told you before about you know what my

2678
03:41:50.98 --> 03:41:56.42
wife had saw in 2003 in this feeling of this family you kind of you know you're done with this

2679
03:41:56.42 --> 03:42:02.10
mission but you know you have a calling to do another mission and the door was kind of clear to me

2680
03:42:02.10 --> 03:42:07.14
and I even wrote on my transition paperwork in the Marine Corps my wife lasts everybody else

2681
03:42:07.14 --> 03:42:13.30
and I don't know what I want to do I'm going to do this and it said flying be part of the

2682
03:42:13.30 --> 03:42:18.18
search and recovery afterwards to try to locate missing men and bring them back home their families

2683
03:42:18.90 --> 03:42:22.90
didn't know how you're going to do that didn't know what you're going to do and then I picked up

2684
03:42:22.90 --> 03:42:28.02
the phone after I transitioned to the Marine Corps and just gave Mark a call and we had an ice

2685
03:42:28.02 --> 03:42:32.82
conversation brought out five minutes he is there you had the Marine Corps came up said absolutely

2686
03:42:32.82 --> 03:42:38.42
he said you'd like to come down like to talk to you came down to Key West for a little bit of

2687
03:42:38.42 --> 03:42:45.22
meeting came back and we started this operation I've been doing for about two years and to great

2688
03:42:45.22 --> 03:42:54.42
relationship a great group of individuals that are military civilians scientists world-renowned

2689
03:42:54.42 --> 03:43:00.74
archaeologists EOD experts military medics you name it as the repertoire to do that

2690
03:43:00.74 --> 03:43:07.62
they're just passionate Americans that are going and researching over 78,000 missing cases

2691
03:43:07.62 --> 03:43:15.78
that are still left out there trying to get at some closure to fulfill America's promise of

2692
03:43:15.78 --> 03:43:19.86
we don't leave our dead wounded when we know where we're at we're going to go and get you

2693
03:43:19.86 --> 03:43:24.10
we may not be able to get you at the time to fight that's actually happening but dead or alive

2694
03:43:24.10 --> 03:43:28.82
you're coming home it's a promise will made it fighting everything you and I just talked about

2695
03:43:28.82 --> 03:43:35.06
the past hours I go my generation was very easy to go into a fight knowing that I was not going

2696
03:43:35.06 --> 03:43:40.34
to be buried in some foreign dirt nation that was somewhere else in the world because the person

2697
03:43:40.34 --> 03:43:44.02
on your left and right was going to make sure that wasn't going to happen just like when we went

2698
03:43:44.02 --> 03:43:48.58
out there in the middle of burning amtrak and that street it was not an option to leave those

2699
03:43:48.58 --> 03:43:53.86
Marines to have their bodies drug through streets or to have anything else like that not on my watch

2700
03:43:53.86 --> 03:44:02.42
and to find out the gravity of this is overall these years that did happen in places and the

2701
03:44:02.42 --> 03:44:06.50
iteration of the United States going out and having this honorable mission to go do that

2702
03:44:07.06 --> 03:44:11.22
it's like I want to be a part of that how can I fit into the paradigm of doing this

2703
03:44:12.90 --> 03:44:19.22
and that was about 2018 kicked off at that time period and then just offered up Mark Hale doing

2704
03:44:19.22 --> 03:44:26.26
assessment of the organization and I just found out this passionate story of how many people what

2705
03:44:26.26 --> 03:44:32.02
they were giving up to go and do this and I said I'll give you an organizational assessment and he

2706
03:44:32.02 --> 03:44:38.74
kind of said put what's that kind of cost me said nothing give me 30 days I'm going to fly it all

2707
03:44:38.74 --> 03:44:42.34
the finding positions I'm going to get to know the people that's here everything I'll come back

2708
03:44:42.34 --> 03:44:46.10
and I kind of give you a little here's what's working here's what's not working here's a

2709
03:44:46.10 --> 03:44:50.74
perspective that's not so close to the boat you do this came back and he turned around and he said

2710
03:44:50.74 --> 03:44:56.66
when I delivered that and he said yes I paid somebody almost 50,000 hours to do that one time

2711
03:44:57.30 --> 03:45:01.22
and you know what they told me at the end of the assessment so what's that Mark he said

2712
03:45:01.22 --> 03:45:07.86
if Mark know ever wants to stop doing this then this mission will be over and he goes I paid

2713
03:45:07.86 --> 03:45:13.70
somebody a little money to do that came back giving a breakdown organizational structure

2714
03:45:13.70 --> 03:45:19.46
how to how to count things into situation reports that where people can do that because you're

2715
03:45:19.46 --> 03:45:24.02
coming from the government so you're actually writing reports that other people that's in another

2716
03:45:24.02 --> 03:45:28.98
organization can actually see and they kind of understand and you're not so far off the course

2717
03:45:29.54 --> 03:45:36.82
and then it was just utterly amazing I went to a funeral and when I went to a funeral the first

2718
03:45:36.82 --> 03:45:42.98
funeral was for funeral by an anime named Texard Carlson and he just happened to be the alpha

2719
03:45:42.98 --> 03:45:51.06
company Patoonson for first Paty and second Marines a landing force from second assault amphibian

2720
03:45:51.06 --> 03:45:59.06
baty and it was second amphibian tractor baty and which was my job on the 23rd of March of 2003

2721
03:45:59.70 --> 03:46:03.78
and that was the first individual it was identified when I was here so it was an amtraker

2722
03:46:04.50 --> 03:46:11.14
they got to attend the amtraker of a guy who did his job on November 20th and lost his life on

2723
03:46:11.14 --> 03:46:17.38
1943 leading the first assault wave in the first LVT's that were ever used in offensive combat

2724
03:46:17.94 --> 03:46:26.10
and then to be able to be a guy in 2003 that was part of task force tarawah that was named

2725
03:46:26.10 --> 03:46:34.34
after those guys my wife I put her on the US as tarawah to go to war and she just looked

2726
03:46:34.34 --> 03:46:41.78
and even before I met Mark Noah my license plate on my car as early as 2010 I got said tarawah

2727
03:46:41.78 --> 03:46:47.30
across the back of the plate before I ever knew that this was what I was going to get into after I

2728
03:46:47.30 --> 03:46:52.98
hung up this thing it's just amazing it I don't think it's ham and stance how that happens

2729
03:46:57.78 --> 03:47:00.90
certainly not have you got have you have you gone to tarawah yet?

2730
03:47:00.90 --> 03:47:12.98
absolutely but five times now went to Europe last year so last year in March we recovered a lost

2731
03:47:12.98 --> 03:47:19.06
row called the missing road D of cemetery 33 that on tarawah is called the main marine cemetery

2732
03:47:19.06 --> 03:47:25.30
now tarawah is only about 800 meters wide by about a click an half long it's not a very thing on

2733
03:47:25.30 --> 03:47:33.14
island a base you know down there on every ounce of that is habitated now earth's huts there's

2734
03:47:33.14 --> 03:47:40.74
everything else built on top of these and years ago the the cemeteries the marries did the best thing

2735
03:47:40.74 --> 03:47:46.34
they could to bear in record the things and then they had to then go to the next time when to fight

2736
03:47:46.90 --> 03:47:53.06
load up an anx ship to fight the thing like that turns it over airfield expansion starts going

2737
03:47:53.06 --> 03:47:58.82
and then the cemeteries and that start moving around that island and then roughly in 1946

2738
03:47:58.82 --> 03:48:03.62
America has this big thing in the American grave registration unit and they're sent around the

2739
03:48:03.62 --> 03:48:09.54
world to try to recover as many lost people in 1946 they can and they get this mandate

2740
03:48:09.54 --> 03:48:15.46
they visit tarawah they get some bones and they bring it back they do that but there's there

2741
03:48:15.46 --> 03:48:21.14
was still 541 people they couldn't find it was out there and that's airfield expansion now it's

2742
03:48:21.14 --> 03:48:27.70
encroachment of the islanders coming back and they're built on top so you can see this mess just

2743
03:48:27.70 --> 03:48:36.18
magnifies itself and after some years of looking for this row in January of the past year not this

2744
03:48:36.18 --> 03:48:43.06
past year but in 19 we had a weather storm go through and blew down a building in an area that we

2745
03:48:43.06 --> 03:48:49.22
were looking to remove the building from and when it did it opened up an excavation opportunity

2746
03:48:49.22 --> 03:48:57.94
it didn't exist prior to do that and that is where we had located road D and road D eventually

2747
03:48:57.94 --> 03:49:03.86
turned into 33 in 90 states marines by the time of the end of that bulldozer row was recovered

2748
03:49:03.86 --> 03:49:10.58
that we're missing PFC Athens as I told you today even in the tragic times it's happened

2749
03:49:10.58 --> 03:49:15.22
out in the Pacific and that the bright point it was here is I got a text from my people right

2750
03:49:15.22 --> 03:49:20.98
before I walked in to talk to you and one more marine out of that trend so I was just identified

2751
03:49:20.98 --> 03:49:27.70
and published by the DOD today from a defense POWMIA accounting agency so that's another

2752
03:49:27.70 --> 03:49:33.30
promise fulfilled to an American family that we don't leave our dead wounded buffoon we'll go

2753
03:49:33.30 --> 03:49:39.38
and we'll do what it takes to do this and so I go out as many times as we can the archaeologists

2754
03:49:39.38 --> 03:49:44.42
go out about six week rotations they come back for about four weeks they go back out it's in there

2755
03:49:44.42 --> 03:49:49.70
and systematically we were hoping within five years to process that entire eye went to the

2756
03:49:49.70 --> 03:49:55.78
fullest it's not possible because they're still roughly approximately 400 and has been identified

2757
03:49:57.14 --> 03:50:06.66
jacco the whole organization has recovered over 337 sets of missing American remains

2758
03:50:06.66 --> 03:50:14.74
up front 130 plus have been positively identified the other moons are in the possession

2759
03:50:14.74 --> 03:50:20.34
of the DNA labs and that so these are going to be more success stories each week each month

2760
03:50:20.34 --> 03:50:27.06
of all the moons that are already in there and then on top of that you have operations and

2761
03:50:27.06 --> 03:50:32.66
Europe you have operations and the Philippines you've got the US government in Vietnam you've got

2762
03:50:32.66 --> 03:50:38.10
everybody out there doing what they can and then we as a private organization augment the skills

2763
03:50:38.10 --> 03:50:44.98
that the US government out there 78,000 people probably a lot or naval casualties as you know

2764
03:50:46.34 --> 03:50:53.78
you probably get roughly 28,000 that are able to be accessed that are here and if you're talking

2765
03:50:53.78 --> 03:51:00.26
about a recovery rate of the government it about 200 of those a year on their own

2766
03:51:00.26 --> 03:51:05.30
they're going to be doing this hundreds of years and they're never going to be able to catch that

2767
03:51:06.10 --> 03:51:12.10
and these things whether it's forestry, whether it's city development, whether it's anything else

2768
03:51:12.58 --> 03:51:18.34
you have the the loss is going to happen each year to where possibly some of these areas that you

2769
03:51:18.34 --> 03:51:24.34
could have recovered a previous year are not accessible a year or two from now so you're always

2770
03:51:24.34 --> 03:51:29.30
racing in its time and especially with the World War II generation you're really racing against

2771
03:51:29.30 --> 03:51:38.34
the wrong time meaning we have young right when named Wendell Perkins that as a

2772
03:51:38.34 --> 03:51:43.78
TAR was survivor and a veteran and we had the great privilege a couple of months ago and it was

2773
03:51:43.78 --> 03:51:50.10
covered here on Memorial Day nationally of locating Wendell's two best friends at Wendell

2774
03:51:50.10 --> 03:51:57.54
had to leave on that island and he survived and Wendell is living a happy and successful life up here

2775
03:51:57.54 --> 03:52:06.26
D.L. McCovey's like everybody else is there about this? I Wendell right now was in here in California

2776
03:52:06.26 --> 03:52:14.42
up in New York for New York and we're going to be able to hopefully do some life feeds for each

2777
03:52:14.42 --> 03:52:18.90
of the services that are coming up as covered restrictions lift so that Wendell can digitally

2778
03:52:18.90 --> 03:52:24.58
attend the funeral for both of his best friends. Well that's awesome and obviously if

2779
03:52:24.58 --> 03:52:29.94
this COVID lifts we get a chance we'll fly up to where Wendell's going to fly up to. I love to

2780
03:52:29.94 --> 03:52:34.58
talk to Wendell. I know you and I were talking about Dean Ladden and how awesome that was to

2781
03:52:34.58 --> 03:52:40.50
sit there and talk to him and I guess he didn't quite make it to TARWA because Dean Ladden got

2782
03:52:40.50 --> 03:52:49.62
gut shot on the way in but yeah I mean obviously we'll do whatever we can to have the opportunity to

2783
03:52:49.62 --> 03:52:57.62
talk to him and anybody else you know because these are these are the you know you're you're

2784
03:52:57.62 --> 03:53:03.62
out there trying to capture the or trying to recover the physical but we can capture the stories you

2785
03:53:03.62 --> 03:53:09.06
know absolutely that would be awesome now is this this is a charitable organization

2786
03:53:09.06 --> 03:53:14.50
there's lots of charities absolutely this is a 501c3 that just happens to have a contract

2787
03:53:14.50 --> 03:53:20.18
a partnership limited for TARWA with the government that is there but we prosecute other cases

2788
03:53:21.06 --> 03:53:27.86
around the world accepting and donations we accept different cases from people to do the research

2789
03:53:27.86 --> 03:53:33.54
for those against what the knowledge is that's out there help these families along and then we

2790
03:53:33.54 --> 03:53:39.94
actually look and take the historical documentation laid against kind of a cold case good as out there

2791
03:53:39.94 --> 03:53:45.22
take the time take the resources that you have and in certain cases we will actually take on missions

2792
03:53:46.26 --> 03:53:51.62
of family members or something that are you know kind of they would like to donate and they

2793
03:53:51.62 --> 03:53:57.22
want to make sure that only is going towards you know the berm a hump or they went over to certain

2794
03:53:57.22 --> 03:54:02.90
things are like that but it helps augment we have a burn rate I go at 10,000 dollars a day

2795
03:54:03.54 --> 03:54:09.38
to try to locate these that's this one one day for two teams to exist to try to find these american

2796
03:54:09.38 --> 03:54:17.70
eras on TARWA and that is just operations on TARWA if you expand that out to do one

2797
03:54:19.78 --> 03:54:26.34
crash sites in Europe looking for boys in the casserine pass for anything else on that

2798
03:54:26.34 --> 03:54:32.10
that just greatly increases the costs rates that are up there and time equipment

2799
03:54:33.30 --> 03:54:38.50
security of US remains like we have in this COVID time period on TARWA and just

2800
03:54:38.50 --> 03:54:47.06
going out and and raising what you can to do what you said you know how can you put a dollar

2801
03:54:47.06 --> 03:54:51.62
value on hey it's one of those things you look around and you're just like we made a promise

2802
03:54:51.62 --> 03:55:00.02
to people years ago I can't imagine what it was like to get a telegraph the western union

2803
03:55:00.02 --> 03:55:05.70
telling you on Christmas Eve that your son's not coming home which many of our veterans from TARW

2804
03:55:05.70 --> 03:55:10.90
whether a family's got that on December 23rd they just happened to show up at the house to do

2805
03:55:10.90 --> 03:55:16.50
that merry Christmas or or the Sullivan brothers or something like this it isn't here

2806
03:55:18.50 --> 03:55:24.18
and that's a bad telegram to get but the telegrams that really break my heart is roughly the

2807
03:55:24.18 --> 03:55:30.66
telegrams that you can see in the national archives from like 1949 and those are the telegrams

2808
03:55:30.66 --> 03:55:36.18
that were sent to families that said not only is your son been killed and he's not coming home

2809
03:55:36.18 --> 03:55:43.78
or no longer looking for them I can only imagine being a mother sitting there reading four years later

2810
03:55:44.42 --> 03:55:50.98
after writing letter after letter after letter to hap Arnold or to whoever would listen can you

2811
03:55:50.98 --> 03:55:56.66
give me some whereabouts of my boy can I have some fun where are they at and we have we have

2812
03:55:56.66 --> 03:56:02.82
these telegrams you know that go to these service leaders like hap Arnold and they're very nice

2813
03:56:02.82 --> 03:56:07.70
and it says thank you very much the life insurance was received and thank you for the

2814
03:56:07.70 --> 03:56:14.10
pleasentries and all this but the bottom line is where's my boy you have an answer that and then

2815
03:56:14.10 --> 03:56:22.34
these families went for decades never getting an answer on where their boy was at so to be able to

2816
03:56:22.34 --> 03:56:29.94
be a US Marine to go back to the island of Taro to stand over top of a unit and watch the excavation

2817
03:56:29.94 --> 03:56:40.10
and the detailed thing of the systematic processing of 120 centimeters down roughly about the

2818
03:56:40.10 --> 03:56:45.38
water line and then you see the skeletal remains start to come through and you see the boots on

2819
03:56:45.38 --> 03:56:50.10
the individual that are still from the good year rubber company that are all there that they're still

2820
03:56:50.10 --> 03:56:57.14
there and then you see the gun belt that's still there this says that that was a BA-R gunner he was a rifleman

2821
03:56:57.14 --> 03:57:02.58
and to hear my young archaeologist that are out there when you're saying I wonder if

2822
03:57:02.58 --> 03:57:08.98
I was 27 or he's 29 or whatever they're telling you by looking and reading these bones this

2823
03:57:08.98 --> 03:57:13.62
kid was 18 years old the sutures on his head are not closed enough here's how you look at this

2824
03:57:13.62 --> 03:57:18.58
it's here and you sit there and you watch them and they're like you've never been in the military

2825
03:57:18.58 --> 03:57:24.66
what are you doing out here on the island of Taro and you found in all these travels you've got

2826
03:57:25.30 --> 03:57:33.30
military civilian PhDs, hunters, Republicans, Democrats, Blacks, White's Puerto Ricans,

2827
03:57:34.50 --> 03:57:38.34
it's this organization that you win today's day in age with all this polarity

2828
03:57:39.46 --> 03:57:46.18
can come together like this to perform this mission to fill the void of 76 years and provide

2829
03:57:46.18 --> 03:57:51.46
closure and bring that back to reinforce that promise the dead are alive we're gonna find you

2830
03:57:51.46 --> 03:57:57.94
and we're gonna come back and have a collective unit like that those were units like I see

2831
03:57:57.94 --> 03:58:02.26
to pride in your eyes when you talk about the team and you see that feel and we're like about

2832
03:58:02.26 --> 03:58:07.70
the same thing on this side they ain't wearing a uniform donation but to service that they

2833
03:58:07.70 --> 03:58:14.02
chose to perform for the nation in a crappy fourth world infested little I wonder in the middle

2834
03:58:14.02 --> 03:58:17.70
it doesn't look like to eat eatier or feed you or anything else like that

2835
03:58:19.70 --> 03:58:21.70
like god matinee or what are supposed to be

2836
03:58:25.78 --> 03:58:31.38
man it's just a awesome awesome I know I know we've been sitting here for for quite a while

2837
03:58:33.46 --> 03:58:38.18
I want to wrap up but but before we wrap up I just want to go through real quick you sent

2838
03:58:38.18 --> 03:58:44.82
like some bullet points to me just of kind of some reflections of some principles that

2839
03:58:46.10 --> 03:58:51.62
that guided you you know and and and still guide you and I just wanted to kind of just

2840
03:58:52.58 --> 03:58:58.26
just go through real quick here because when I read them each one of them you know

2841
03:58:58.26 --> 03:59:03.78
as I sat there silently read my email I just kind of said they're nodding my heads and yep

2842
03:59:03.78 --> 03:59:14.74
number one whatever it takes number two savage action and aggression in combat and in life

2843
03:59:17.62 --> 03:59:24.66
number three in total combat and warfare you will get punched in the face

2844
03:59:24.66 --> 03:59:37.22
number four no excuses don't have a victim mentality number five never leave a fallen

2845
03:59:37.22 --> 03:59:46.58
comrade behind both in and out of the military number six moral and ethical leadership

2846
03:59:46.58 --> 03:59:59.86
both in and out of combat number seven take total responsibility number eight always in the fight

2847
03:59:59.86 --> 04:00:11.06

number twelve establish and reinforce a winning mentality on and off the battlefield

2850
04:00:29.06 --> 04:00:41.54

2851
04:00:41.54 --> 04:00:53.70

2852
04:00:53.70 --> 04:01:05.94
of character number sixteen live an honorable and valourous life and number seventeen

2853
04:01:07.30 --> 04:01:12.50
not for self but for country

2854
04:01:12.50 --> 04:01:26.58
some things don't really even need further discussion and that's what I liked about that

2855
04:01:26.58 --> 04:01:34.98
list as I read through it like I said I just nodded my head um unbelievable guidance from your

2856
04:01:34.98 --> 04:01:40.74
life from your thirty years in the military from your heroic actions and not just your own heroic

2857
04:01:40.74 --> 04:01:54.10
actions but for all the heroes that you saw around you and you know to me that's what this is about

2858
04:01:57.62 --> 04:02:02.10
you know you set in this example you put in these words and you continuing to live a life of

2859
04:02:02.10 --> 04:02:11.46
service to go out there and bring home these heroes I'll leave it to you for any other closing

2860
04:02:11.46 --> 04:02:18.02
thoughts you might have right now I think these it's been an honor and privilege really a

2861
04:02:18.02 --> 04:02:27.30
professional pleasure to spend this time today with with you and echo discussing what isn't

2862
04:02:27.30 --> 04:02:33.70
what may be common to some people just isn't common to everybody that is out there and

2863
04:02:34.82 --> 04:02:41.14
your podcasts and the impact that those podcasts do have the amount of people from all

2864
04:02:41.14 --> 04:02:47.86
different walks of life that kind of tune in to this platform and this voice that is out there

2865
04:02:47.86 --> 04:02:53.54
in this time right now especially in the trying time that we have now it's these reinforcing

2866
04:02:53.54 --> 04:02:59.46
principles that we're talking you know you and I and echo and now we didn't make these up

2867
04:03:01.22 --> 04:03:08.26
you know I didn't wake up and have some 17 part epiphany of doing that it's you know

2868
04:03:08.90 --> 04:03:15.78
it's really rare to have a you know a unique thought these days because when you actually

2869
04:03:15.78 --> 04:03:22.02
we then reach back into the context of history you normally find somewhere along the line what you're

2870
04:03:22.02 --> 04:03:30.18
actually saying has been either done or displayed or you can actually find a mentor or somebody

2871
04:03:30.18 --> 04:03:36.02
out there that that leads and acts the same way that you're talking and then you kind of find out

2872
04:03:36.82 --> 04:03:42.10
for people that's on the podcast that are well you know what I've never been in the military or

2873
04:03:42.10 --> 04:03:47.70
listen you find out it wasn't the military and a lot of times it taught these things it was

2874
04:03:47.70 --> 04:03:53.14
here you find out when you when you look around at the goodness of your whole life and if you look at

2875
04:03:53.14 --> 04:04:00.26
the context of your life line rather than the best years of your life was these years or these

2876
04:04:00.26 --> 04:04:06.10
years if you look at their all building blocks on the entire time line of your life you find out

2877
04:04:06.10 --> 04:04:11.54
that that teacher that wasn't in the military that taught you this is what you learned here that

2878
04:04:11.54 --> 04:04:18.50
coach that was hard on you here that taught you here the mother that you thought was making dinner

2879
04:04:18.50 --> 04:04:24.58
was actually married to a soldier for 26 years so even though that soldier's not here I might have picked

2880
04:04:24.58 --> 04:04:30.18
up some of the leadership things from your old man so you might want to listen because maybe it

2881
04:04:30.18 --> 04:04:36.10
looks like me doing it but maybe I heard it from somewhere else and you feel that responsibility

2882
04:04:36.10 --> 04:04:41.62
from generations and I've watched that and I've listened to that through these podcasts

2883
04:04:42.26 --> 04:04:47.78
from whether it's from kids and children there is always something here because it really

2884
04:04:48.66 --> 04:04:54.02
reinforces what we have been discussing about today and it doesn't have to be

2885
04:04:54.50 --> 04:04:55.54
this traumatic

2886
04:04:56.90 --> 04:05:02.18
fallerous or a grievous incident that's in your life that defines

2887
04:05:02.18 --> 04:05:09.14
that's who your life is now you performed in those incidences because of the conglomeration

2888
04:05:09.62 --> 04:05:16.26
of who you were in the Constitution that made it up at that period and it allows you to overcome

2889
04:05:16.26 --> 04:05:22.42
those incidences just like overcoming COVID just like overcoming a car crash just like overcoming

2890
04:05:22.42 --> 04:05:29.38
anything else in life I believe this provides resiliency and tools for people they may not identify

2891
04:05:29.38 --> 04:05:36.66
with podcast number 176 they may not identify not even identify ever with a whole podcast

2892
04:05:37.22 --> 04:05:41.06
but there's something that somebody can take out of each little one of those in a

2893
04:05:41.06 --> 04:05:46.42
appliance of their own life I believe in the context of overall it builds a better person

2894
04:05:46.42 --> 04:05:51.94
so I thank you for the opportunity to be able to come here and do that and it is it was my pleasure

2895
04:05:53.22 --> 04:05:58.98
to be here I have my pleasure for every single day to wear the uniform and the cloth of our

2896
04:05:58.98 --> 04:06:05.30
nation we're pleasure to be able to just have a conversation amongst two warriors today

2897
04:06:06.34 --> 04:06:13.54
I'm probably a little more aged or whatever that is on that but it really is and these are healthy

2898
04:06:14.26 --> 04:06:20.34
I go and you're providing a platform for people to do that and also tell the story

2899
04:06:21.46 --> 04:06:27.46
the story of these American nature it's stated but lost for generations the average person

2900
04:06:27.46 --> 04:06:34.18
does not know that story jacco the average person on the street out there still has no idea

2901
04:06:34.18 --> 04:06:41.46
that we have 28,000 missing people we have 78,000 we can probably get about 28,000 but they also

2902
04:06:41.46 --> 04:06:46.42
sometimes come up to me go and I really appreciate what it is you do but I didn't serve in the

2903
04:06:46.42 --> 04:06:51.38
military and it doesn't affect me or that but within like a five minute conversation of anybody

2904
04:06:51.38 --> 04:06:57.06
that tells you they didn't serve or they didn't have a connection to the military you can take

2905
04:06:57.06 --> 04:07:01.94
almost anybody in this country whether you're an immigrant or a national or anything and within a

2906
04:07:01.94 --> 04:07:09.62
five minute conversation you can expose to them that somewhere in their family line somebody had

2907
04:07:09.62 --> 04:07:15.78
to fight they had the same blood inside of there whether it's a restaurant and little Italy right here

2908
04:07:15.78 --> 04:07:21.14
whether it's coming over on the boat it doesn't matter they had to fight to get to that and then a lot

2909
04:07:21.14 --> 04:07:26.98
of times they just didn't know it but a lot of those people had to do it in the uniform too and

2910
04:07:26.98 --> 04:07:31.94
then all of a sudden the light comes on and then you find out they're like oh yeah I did have

2911
04:07:31.94 --> 04:07:38.02
an uncle that was in Vietnam now she's think about it and then the connecting file gets there and

2912
04:07:38.02 --> 04:07:44.50
when the connecting file was there pride discipline desire motivation it transcends that uniform

2913
04:07:44.50 --> 04:07:50.90
and you get that passion and then it's never about the money never about the money it is a

2914
04:07:50.90 --> 04:07:56.82
boutful filling dot promise the same promise that we make those men and women today in that

2915
04:07:56.82 --> 04:08:02.34
uniform swear to each other that allows people like you and I they don't wear the uniform in the

2916
04:08:02.34 --> 04:08:11.14
cloth and they're nation anymore it allows me to sit back at night and say that if they still

2917
04:08:11.14 --> 04:08:17.38
follow the code they still build the same way and put them on the conveyor belt to do that they're

2918
04:08:17.38 --> 04:08:22.18
going to spit out the best American fighting man and woman the world is still ever seen and don't

2919
04:08:22.18 --> 04:08:28.26
anybody ever forget that it's not just guys jumping out of planes in 1944 or coming out of landing

2920
04:08:28.26 --> 04:08:33.46
crap those news out there today are the most lethal things that you can put on the very

2921
04:08:33.46 --> 04:08:38.42
battle field say a night state somebody wants to test the borders or somebody wants to

2922
04:08:38.42 --> 04:08:44.26
poke us or try to do that you keep poking the bear it's on there you keep poking the bear

2923
04:08:44.26 --> 04:08:50.34
just watch the eagle fly over take a dump on your head and when the eagle does that boom we bring

2924
04:08:50.34 --> 04:08:57.86
a lot of things behind that as well um don't know what else more to say jacca that has been already

2925
04:08:57.86 --> 04:09:03.38
said it said thank you it's been my pleasure today well you know thank you for coming on

2926
04:09:03.38 --> 04:09:08.66
more important obviously thanks for your service thanks for what you did for the country for the

2927
04:09:08.66 --> 04:09:16.26
Marine Corps and and like I said thank you thank you for continuing to serve by working to bring

2928
04:09:16.26 --> 04:09:26.98
these heroes home and truly living up to the words semper fiddellis thanks Justin thank you

2929
04:09:26.98 --> 04:09:38.10
and with that Justin the Hugh has left the building awesome honor to be able to talk to him

2930
04:09:39.06 --> 04:09:49.94
and another reminder that we all have more work to do more work to do to continue to be better

2931
04:09:49.94 --> 04:10:01.86
stay on the path echo Charles what he got for us just stay on the path well we're gonna

2932
04:10:04.02 --> 04:10:09.30
so to know that we're on the path that's a big one why before that before I go into that

2933
04:10:11.38 --> 04:10:16.18
it's hearing like his story actually a lot of these stories or whatever but this was for some reason

2934
04:10:16.18 --> 04:10:20.66
maybe because it was like so long and it made me like contemplate the whole time where it's like a

2935
04:10:20.66 --> 04:10:26.02
reminder for us who didn't go to work you know who's not in the military necessarily and we just kind of

2936
04:10:26.02 --> 04:10:32.98
you know we're cruising here and you know that thought that's like dang all that was going on

2937
04:10:32.98 --> 04:10:36.98
at that like that's what you know because you say the dates and you're like I remember what I was doing

2938
04:10:36.98 --> 04:10:45.46
2003 I remember that what I was doing and you kind of flashed to man that's what he was doing at that time

2939
04:10:45.46 --> 04:10:49.70
and you kind of make that little comparison and it's man it's like a it's a big eye open

2940
04:10:49.70 --> 04:10:57.78
especially when you drill down to it not hey that's what he was doing in August or in March but

2941
04:10:57.78 --> 04:11:05.06
when you say oh on that day at that moment in time he was going into a

2942
04:11:07.38 --> 04:11:12.98
blown out AAV trying to recover bodies under fire like that's what he was doing at that moment

2943
04:11:12.98 --> 04:11:18.66
so yeah it's definitely something definitely when you get even more specific where that yeah and

2944
04:11:18.66 --> 04:11:25.22
it's the broad one is the same way you think oh oh in 2003 what was echoed trouble was I

2945
04:11:25.22 --> 04:11:30.50
doing in 2003 and I was here I was hoping I would get to go over you know and he's in the battle

2946
04:11:30.50 --> 04:11:36.90
in Nazareia you know it's so and you know you need to take that one step further and it's like

2947
04:11:36.90 --> 04:11:42.10
right now there's people out holding the line and there's people prepping to do an

2948
04:11:42.10 --> 04:11:46.66
operation there's people doing operations and you know it's not just military operations either

2949
04:11:46.66 --> 04:11:52.98
but there's you know there's someone that just found out that you know they their kid has cancer

2950
04:11:52.98 --> 04:11:57.38
like there's all these things are happening right now and you know the big thing and we talked

2951
04:11:57.38 --> 04:12:03.46
about it briefly is that an AV just apparently was lost all the coast of California here and I was

2952
04:12:04.50 --> 04:12:10.10
very similar fought pattern you know this morning for me I've seen that on the news and I mean

2953
04:12:10.10 --> 04:12:15.78
I've been out there right next to these AVs doing work with them I know that the weather is good

2954
04:12:15.78 --> 04:12:20.74
it's a sunny day it's a beautiful day this is Southern California and a month to all that

2955
04:12:23.06 --> 04:12:30.50
you know it's a nightmare for for those Marines that unit and their families and it's just

2956
04:12:30.50 --> 04:12:38.82
yeah really makes you think about where you where you are and what you're doing and are you on the

2957
04:12:38.82 --> 04:12:49.70
right path you know fully so yes so make the most of it you know kind of kind of that old thing

2958
04:12:49.70 --> 04:12:54.98
make the most of it everyone's in a while you know like you'll get injured like something that'll take

2959
04:12:54.98 --> 04:13:00.74
you out like for you know like a month like a month or more recovery time or whatever so that for

2960
04:13:00.74 --> 04:13:07.46
that month you can't really do certain things if not like a lot of things and then when you finally

2961
04:13:07.46 --> 04:13:13.22
heal up and are able to do it you have that like appreciation for just everyday stuff it's like

2962
04:13:13.22 --> 04:13:19.54
that's kind of like thinking about these things I found like kind of just rejuvenates that appreciation

2963
04:13:19.54 --> 04:13:27.78
yeah yeah no doubt about it no doubt about it you know also I don't think I mentioned this during

2964
04:13:27.78 --> 04:13:36.66
the podcast but for if you want to support the recovery of these fallen heroes go to history flight

2965
04:13:36.66 --> 04:13:44.26
dot com and then they also have an Instagram page which is at history flight so you want to support

2966
04:13:44.26 --> 04:13:51.86
some of these awesome efforts that are going on well that's how you do it so yes stay on the path

2967
04:13:51.86 --> 04:13:57.62
for ourselves and the people around us because that's who it affects fully you know we want to keep

2968
04:13:57.62 --> 04:14:05.46
ourselves in shape and keep ourselves capable doing that we're working out we're trying to stay healthy

2969
04:14:05.86 --> 04:14:11.94
it's not a hundred percent thing I dig it you know 80 20 90 10 kind of situation I dealing in my opinion

2970
04:14:11.94 --> 04:14:17.46
but anyway on the way you will need supplementation so jockel fuel what is jockel fuel so

2971
04:14:18.58 --> 04:14:24.02
I when I said jockel fuel one time I remember saying it and thinking oh I jockel fuels like

2972
04:14:24.02 --> 04:14:29.46
seems like an individual product the way I said it so let me clarify jockel fuel is a collection

2973
04:14:29.46 --> 04:14:38.50
of supplementation elements so this part we already know super cruel oil your cruel oil with some

2974
04:14:38.50 --> 04:14:43.70
antioxidants in there joint warfare for your joint so you join to take a beating you know varying

2975
04:14:43.70 --> 04:14:48.10
levels of beatings when you when you're working out you're doing different workouts you do too all that

2976
04:14:48.10 --> 04:14:56.90
stuff so this is why this is important super cruel oil joint warfare and also we have vitamin D

2977
04:14:56.90 --> 04:15:06.26
free immune system big big deal also cold or free immune system still a big deal so yes these are

2978
04:15:06.26 --> 04:15:11.70
all part of jockel fuel including in or as should I say additionally milk protein in the form of

2979
04:15:11.70 --> 04:15:21.70
of a dessert meaning it's the best tasting protein mix you'll ever have I think that's proven double

2980
04:15:21.70 --> 04:15:26.34
blind my feet I'm on a little peanut butter little peanut butter chocolate kick right now

2981
04:15:26.34 --> 04:15:34.26
yeah because I had to that is a good taste I mean it is a good taste you add extra peanut butter

2982
04:15:34.26 --> 04:15:40.58
why don't I just as is I do sometimes why don't be laying a little bit more peanut buttery

2983
04:15:40.58 --> 04:15:47.06
nonetheless I dig it 100% and that's what that is also discipline the supplement discipline powder

2984
04:15:47.06 --> 04:15:55.94
mix is this for your brain and your body by the way powder mix uh cans RTD cans

2985
04:15:55.94 --> 04:16:08.18
and discipline go pills new flavor out straight up out sour apples sniper and it's important

2986
04:16:08.18 --> 04:16:16.34
note that this is JP Dinelle's signature right because he's a sniper yeah what's your what's your

2987
04:16:16.34 --> 04:16:22.74
assessment of the flavor good not as sour as I anticipated but it could have been one of those

2988
04:16:22.74 --> 04:16:26.26
deals where I'm like I opened it up I'm like whew I'm getting ready for the sourness you know

2989
04:16:26.26 --> 04:16:34.02
so maybe over yeah over expectations we're off yeah but but delicious Pete Pete just said to me

2990
04:16:34.02 --> 04:16:39.70
it just went into first place in his book don't kidding because and he said the reason why he said

2991
04:16:39.70 --> 04:16:45.94
it's sweet yeah he said he said he said he get that little that he's got that little he's got a sweet

2992
04:16:45.94 --> 04:16:57.78
tooth you know that kids choking down bockle vase you know that does make sense and it is good though

2993
04:16:57.78 --> 04:17:04.18
in that way it's just not as tangier sour as I thought yeah so but it does have some sweetness to it

2994
04:17:04.18 --> 04:17:10.82
if you got that sweet tooth what if you got that Pete Roberts sweet tooth I like yeah it's freaking

2995
04:17:10.82 --> 04:17:18.58
legit right now jockelpombers in the lead I think continually for me but Pete Roberts just

2996
04:17:18.58 --> 04:17:26.50
pushed it but my my kids are mostly dax average that could just be in support of Dakota just

2997
04:17:26.50 --> 04:17:32.18
but now it has the sweetness as well the dax average one I don't know I taste that

2998
04:17:33.86 --> 04:17:38.90
yeah it's from either sweetness to but it's not it's not it's not as sweet as sour apple

2999
04:17:38.90 --> 04:17:44.98
sniper is it I can dig it I had it's been a few weeks and I've been pounding the

3043
04:22:26.90 --> 04:22:33.46
full title because in order to make it mine well I just put my name on it and then no one can

3044
04:22:33.46 --> 04:22:39.30
say like you took my name no I didn't take your name your name isn't jocco is it so jocco unraveling

3045
04:22:39.30 --> 04:22:43.46
right now we're releasing on this feed soon it'll be on a separate feed we got the grounded

3046
04:22:43.46 --> 04:22:48.50
podcast we got the warrior kid podcast we got warrior kid soap from irish oaks ranch dot com

3047
04:22:48.50 --> 04:22:56.18
where you can get soap so that you can for the love of god you can stay clean

3048
04:22:56.18 --> 04:23:03.30
uh YouTube you want to tell them about YouTube just I know you're quite going into that

3049
04:23:04.98 --> 04:23:11.22
well we're all into that from time to time so yes you want to watch the video version or have

3050
04:23:11.22 --> 04:23:17.30
the video version playing playing in the office in the gym in the house whatever connected to

3051
04:23:17.30 --> 04:23:21.62
surround sound boom you're right in the middle of a conversation physically visually all that stuff

3052
04:23:21.62 --> 04:23:26.90
anyway we have a youtube channel that's the point we also have excerpts on there so you know you can

3053
04:23:26.90 --> 04:23:34.18
share them with your friends and it's more likely your friend is going to watch a two minute up to you

3054
04:23:34.18 --> 04:23:42.42
know you know varying levels of length videos then maybe a four hour pod yes from time to time okay

3055
04:23:42.82 --> 04:23:47.62
we're sponsoring some people don't have the where we're thaw or the time well at the

3056
04:23:47.62 --> 04:23:51.94
location at that moment you know like you you send me a link right you're like hey check this out

3057
04:23:51.94 --> 04:23:57.14
for a you need to check that out yeah and then look I'm concerned at the gas station right now so

3058
04:23:57.14 --> 04:24:00.74
maybe you know maybe I'll check that for a while watch a two minute video just pumping gas you're

3059
04:24:00.74 --> 04:24:04.42
done with the video it's over technically you can take the information whether maybe apply it

3060
04:24:04.42 --> 04:24:09.54
exactly right you won't have the depth of knowledge though no you can apply it quickly but if you

3061
04:24:09.54 --> 04:24:14.66
want to reinforce it that's why when you are we're cutting your lawn you listen the whole thing

3062
04:24:14.66 --> 04:24:18.50
well you watch all the thing while you're doing dishes shouldn't take you two and a half hours

3063
04:24:18.50 --> 04:24:24.02
three and a half hours to do dishes but maybe over a week you're watching it you know it takes you 20 minutes

3064
04:24:24.82 --> 04:24:31.54
consolidate some time for me also that you get there yeah technically but like I said though if

3065
04:24:31.54 --> 04:24:36.18
if at any given moment you get sent to three hour video versus a two minute video it's more

3066
04:24:36.18 --> 04:24:40.98
likely they can have the time to watch a two minute video so it increases the likelihood of someone

3067
04:24:40.98 --> 04:24:47.38
actually watching it that's the benefit of an excerpt whatever that excerpt may be so that's why these

3068
04:24:47.38 --> 04:24:53.30
excerpts exist see what I'm saying fair enough I'm just saying if you if you in this is why you

3069
04:24:53.30 --> 04:25:00.10
should share an excerpt if it if it resonates resonates with you or someone you know that or might

3070
04:25:00.10 --> 04:25:04.90
resonate with someone you know this is why you share it because if you okay there's an excerpt

3071
04:25:04.90 --> 04:25:10.18
about I forget the title but it's about how you feel versus how you behave right I think it was

3072
04:25:10.18 --> 04:25:15.14
something about hangry or something like that remember that one it's oldy but good yeah on the last

3073
04:25:16.10 --> 04:25:20.34
so it's basically if you're frustrated on the inside of whatever you don't have to act frustrated

3074
04:25:21.70 --> 04:25:25.22
you know how you feel and how you behave should you should separate those things you should behave as

3075
04:25:25.22 --> 04:25:28.74
good as you can anyway so a lot of people that's a good value-boe information what if you share

3076
04:25:28.74 --> 04:25:32.82
that with three people around you and they shared that with two people around them they shared that

3077
04:25:32.82 --> 04:25:37.22
with four people around them and see everyone around you is behaving correctly whether they're

3078
04:25:37.22 --> 04:25:42.42
frustrated or not from actually having a massive impact in the entire world that's what you're saying at

3079
04:25:42.42 --> 04:25:46.90
the end of the day yes so that's the benefit and this goes for any concept so there's a lot of excerpts

3080
04:25:46.90 --> 04:25:50.66
out there's one saying so I'm saying check them out on that youtube channel you know if you got

3081
04:25:50.66 --> 04:25:56.74
this you got a moment do it it's good also psychological warfare this is an album with jocco

3082
04:25:56.74 --> 04:26:04.02
tracks on it many tracks for many different scenarios and those scenarios are moments of weakness that

3083
04:26:04.02 --> 04:26:10.34
you might incur is that a good word is that the correct word incur I'm an incur it's an okay

3084
04:26:10.34 --> 04:26:17.14
usage okay boom there you go incur if you get like a C okay good pass incur a moment of weakness you

3085
04:26:17.14 --> 04:26:22.42
want to invoke jocco to help you not yell at you or nothing like this help you just listen to
