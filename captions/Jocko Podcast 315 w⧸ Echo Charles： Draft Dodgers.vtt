00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 315 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good evening.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
7 plus 14 equals A21 B22 C23 D24.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
A boy buys a sandwich for 20 cents, milk for 10 cents, and pie for 15 cents.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
How much does he pay for it all? A30 cents B35 cents C45 cents D50 cents.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A rose is a kind of A animal B bird C fish D flower.

7
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
A chord most merely means A ignorant B dangerous C clumsy D vulgar.

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I rate most nearly means A irresponsible B in subordinate C untidy D angry.

9
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Those are examples from a brochure that was handed out to potential service recruits in the 1960s

10
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to explain to them the type of questions that they were going to be asked on the AFQT, the armed forces qualification tests.

11
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
What we now call the ASVAB in order to qualify them for military service.

12
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I read that from an appendix that's in a book called McNamara's Folly, the use of low IQ troops in the Vietnam War.

13
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The book was written by a guy by the name of Hamilton Gregory who served in Vietnam himself.

14
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In this book Gregory explains that not everyone could pass that test, which meant that there were people who did not qualify to join the service.

15
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They did not have the cognitive capacity to be a soldier.

16
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But guess what? In order to fight a war, you need men.

17
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And McNamara devised a way to get more men into the military, whether they were capable or not.

18
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And it is a very sad story indeed.

19
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You're going to find out that Hamilton Gregory actually ended up very close with some of these people during some parts of his service.

20
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So let's go to the book. In 1966, the US War in Vietnam was heating up rapidly.

21
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
President Johnson and his secretary of defense Robert McNamara were faced with the problem. The armed forces needed more troops for the war zone.

22
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But there was a shortage of men who were considered fair game for the military draft.

23
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There were plenty of men of draft age, which is 18 to 26 in America, but most of them were unavailable.

24
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Many were attending college using student deferments to avoid the draft.

25
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Workers had found safe havens in the National Guard and Reserves, which by and large were not sent to Vietnam.

26
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So if you in the National Guard or Reserves, you weren't going to get sent to war.

27
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
That's not true anymore.

28
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But in Vietnam, if you were in the National Guard, you weren't getting sent to Vietnam.

29
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Still others were disqualified because they scored poorly on the military's mental and physical entrance tests.

30
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000
How could Johnson and McNamara round up enough men to send a war? They realized they would anger the vote power from middle class if they drafted college boys.

31
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And if they sent National Guardsmen and Reserves to Vietnam.

32
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So instead they decided to induct the low scoring men whom Johnson referred for referred to in a secret White House tape as,

33
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.000
quote, second class fellows. And quote, on October 1st, 1966, McNamara launched a program called Project 100,000,

34
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
which lowered the mental standards.

35
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Men who had been unqualified for military duty the day before were now deemed qualified.

36
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
By the end of the war, McNamara's program had taken 354,000 substandard men into the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and Navy.

37
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Among the troops, these men were often known as McNamara's Morons or the Moron Corps or McNamara's boys.

38
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Military leaders from William Mess West, Moreland, the Commanding General and Vietnam, two mutinants and sergeants to the platoon level, viewed McNamara's program as a disaster.

39
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Because many of the project 100,000 men were slow learners, they had difficulty absorbing necessary training because many of them were incompetent combat.

40
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
They endangered not only themselves, but their comrades as well.

41
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
A total of 5,478 low IQ men died well in the service, most of them in combat.

42
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Their fatality rate was 3 times as high as other GIs.

43
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
An estimated 20,000 were wounded and some were permanently disabled.

44
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
There were also tens of thousands of other, quote, second-class men who were not part of Project 100,000,

45
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
but were inducted despite medical defects, such as missing fingers and blindness in one eye, psychiatric disorders,

46
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
social, malajustment and criminal backgrounds.

47
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Military leaders didn't want them, but were forced to accept them.

48
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We don't know how many of them died or were wounded.

49
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
While I was in the Army, which was 1967 to 1970, I got to know some of McNamara's substandard soldiers,

50
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and I vowed that someday I would tell their stories and give the historical background.

51
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This book is the fulfillment of that vow.

52
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
There's the opener. That's just the prologue.

53
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It's very disturbing to hear this.

54
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And also, as we read through this, you're going to definitely think of Forest Gump.

55
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You all, we have all seen that movie Forest Gump, and you think, how is that guy in the military?

56
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
He's a perfect example, and you're going to hear plenty of examples like that.

57
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Same thing with full metal jacket, you know, private pile.

58
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Obviously, a guy you think, well, how could he actually get recruited?

59
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well, here's how. McNamara's 100K.

60
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Here's a note. He says, author's note, I'm aware words like, more on retarded, fatso,

61
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and dwarf are considered insensitive and offensive in today's society, but I use them because they were widely used in the 1960s.

62
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And it would mar the historical accuracy of my report if I replace them with words that are kinder.

63
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Likewise, I sometimes quote individuals whose descriptions are harsh and unsympathetic,

64
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but I have included them to document how men who were different were viewed and treated in those days.

65
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Names and certain other identifying features of the men at Fort Benning have been changed to protect the privacy of the individuals and their families.

66
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So, there's some language clearly that is considered offensive today, and he knows that,

67
00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
but he wanted to kind of give a feel of what these guys were like and how they were being treated,

68
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
what they were being called back in the day.

69
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So, moving into this a little bit, getting into how his story started.

70
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
He says, one morning in the summer of 1967, I was seated with over 100 men in a room at the Armed Forces induction center in Nashville, Tennessee.

71
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But it was the height of the Vietnam War, and I had volunteered for service in the U.S. Army.

72
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Sergeant walked into the room and announced that all of us would leave soon for travel to Fort Benning, Georgia, to begin our army training,

73
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
then he asked, is anyone here a college graduate?

74
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I raised my hand, and he motioned me to follow him.

75
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
He took me down a hallway to a bench where a young man was sitting.

76
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
He informed me that the young man was named Johnny Gupton, who was also being assigned to Fort Benning.

77
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I want you to take charge of Gupton, he said, go with him every step of the way.

78
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Without bothering to lower his voice, he explained that Gupton could neither read nor write,

79
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and would be neat and would need help filling out paperwork when we arrived at Benning.

80
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Then he added, make sure he doesn't get lost.

81
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
He's one of McNamara's morons.

82
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I had never heard the term, and I was surprised that the sergeant would openly insult Gupton.

83
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:25.000
In a few weeks, I would learn that McNamara's morons was a team that many officers and NCOs used to refer to low IQ men who were taking into the military under a program,

84
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
devised by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara to raise their IQs and mold them into productive soldiers.

85
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
He goes on a little bit further and says, I was nervous about the rigors ahead, but I felt brave and stoic and important.

86
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I envisioned losing weight and bulking up my muscles and becoming a lean green fighting machine.

87
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
As the popular saying, had it, I looked beyond the eight weeks of hell and pictured myself going home on leave, looking hard and fit.

88
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I tried to make small talk with Gupton, but he didn't say much.

89
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I asked him what state he was from, but he didn't know.

90
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
He spoke with a hillbilly accent and used mountain phrases like, I know it and so do water.

91
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
He looked unhealthily thin.

92
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I was surprised that he knew nothing about the situation he was in. He didn't understand what basic training was all about,

93
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and he didn't know that America was in a war.

94
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I tried to explain what was happening, but at the end I could tell he was still in a fog.

95
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.000
That's what we're dealing with here. Guys that don't even know what state they're from.

96
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
There's a bunch of details in here. You got to get the book and read it.

97
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
As he interacts with some of these folks, they have to put down their address. They can't write.

98
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
They can't fill out a form because they can't read. It's very, very sad.

99
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
When is this book written? He wrote it. I mean, he wrote it now, but it's taking place in 1960, whatever.

100
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But at this book came copyright in 2015.

101
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I actually researched to try and get in touch with Hamilton Gregory, but unfortunately he passed away.

102
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Here's an example of what we're dealing with.

103
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Gupton's new combat boots provided a challenge. He could tie the laces, but the knot was primitive and ineffective.

104
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I tried to teach him how to make a standard knot to know a veil, so I ended up tying his boots every morning.

105
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
He says Gupton was unable to make his bunk to strict army specifications, so Flo Ellen was another guy.

106
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Flo Ellen and I had to do a job form every morning. Gupton had difficulty distinguishing between officers and sergeants.

107
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
He goes through all kinds of examples of what's going on in boot camp.

108
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And they show up at boot camp.

109
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
They're doing standard boot camp stuff.

110
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I want to go to Vietnam. I want to kill some Viet Kong. Don't call me.

111
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Sir, I work for a living. Kind of all those stereotypical things that you hear about all that's going on.

112
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Fast forward a little bit.

113
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This chapter is called weaklings, fatties and dummies. One morning as the 185 trainees of Bravo Company were assembled in front of Captain Bosch.

114
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
He called out the names of 15 men, including me and Gupton.

115
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
We were ordered to come forth and stand in line in front of the captain. He announced that we had been identified as being deficient.

116
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
You are the scum of this company. A goddamn bunch of weaklings and fatties and dummies, he said.

117
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
For now on, we would be known as the Muck Squad. You know what Muck is? That's a shit at the bottom of a sewage pit.

118
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.000
That's what you are. Worthless shit. I'm going to run your asses all day long. He said that Bravo Company had a good chance of compiling the highest average on the final PT test of any company at Fort Benninging.

119
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
But that we threatened to drag down the company average.

120
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We were still members of our regional platoons, but whenever Captain Bosch asked for the Muck Squad,

121
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
we had to leave our comrades and line up in front of him. We received physical training beyond what we received with our platoons.

122
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It was often given before lunch and after dinner.

123
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So you can kind of pick this up and I forget if I highlight this or not.

124
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
But the guy actually Hamilton Gregory is not in good shape.

125
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And so he shows up and he even mentioned you know I want to lose some fat in some muscle.

126
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So he's not like an athletic guy that shows up and apparently that's why he's getting called out.

127
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Here's another interesting story about what we're dealing with.

128
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Someone in the barracks discovered that Gupton fought a nickel was more valuable than dying because it was bigger in size.

129
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I saw him being cheated by a trainee who said, I'll give you this big nickel if you give me your little dime.

130
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
He says, word of Gupton's ignorance about coins apparently spread to the officers because one day Muck Squad lined up,

131
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Captain Bosch appeared with several visiting officers and the first thing they did was show up in a nickel and a dime and asked him what you would prefer.

132
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
They all grin when he pointed to the nickel.

133
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Did you ever think that?

134
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Do you ever remember thinking that that an nickel is worth more than that?

135
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, when I was five.

136
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Yeah, but I remember that because it kind of made sense in a way before you're good or you knew basic math.

137
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Because look, you got a penny which kind of segregated itself because it's not made out of the shiny silver stuff or whatever it's made out of something.

138
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Yeah, you don't more brown.

139
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
But I actually can remember thinking a penny was more valuable than a dime.

140
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Oh, okay.

141
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I was just going to size.

142
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's going.

143
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We're just going to mass.

144
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
But it makes sense if you just exclude the dime a nickel relationship and the penny to this other fact.

145
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
But if you exclude that little relationship, it makes sense because you go up, you go quarters bigger.

146
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And you got the 50 cent piece, that's even bigger.

147
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
You got the dollar, that's even bigger back home.

148
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Cool, but the point is what age did you figure out that that wasn't a deal?

149
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I don't know, but I just said, I can kind of relate a little bit.

150
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You can relate to guff them when you were five.

151
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
This guy's in the military, which paints a picture.

152
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And if we trading coins, yeah, that's too.

153
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It's awful.

154
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Yeah.

155
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
He says, then the visitor's student from the one man at a time and ask such questions as who's the president of the United States.

156
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This question was one of the most most the men could not answer.

157
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Only officers looked at me, probably noting my goofy face and asked, where are we fighting a war?

158
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Vietnam sir, where's Vietnam located?

159
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I replied as much as I could muster.

160
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Sir, Vietnam is situated in Asia directly south of China and in addition to Louson Cambodia.

161
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
He looks surprised by my intelligent response.

162
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And his fellow officers grinned.

163
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
He's a college graduate, Interjected, Captain Bosch.

164
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But he's bad, be out of shape.

165
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
One of the visitors who was a captain asked, up then, which rank is higher, Captain or general?

166
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Goupton was speaks us for a few moments in the in-stammered, I don't know, Drill Sergeant, Drill Sergeant, the officer yelled.

167
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
He pointed as his insignia and said, don't you know these two bars mean, Captain?

168
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Don't you know what you're supposed to say, sir?

169
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Captain Bosch said, can you believe this idiot was drafted?

170
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I'll tell you who else is an idiot.

171
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Fucking Robert McNamera.

172
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
How can he expect us to win a war if we draft these morons?

173
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Captain Bosch's contemptuous remark about defense, Secretary McNamera was typical of the comments I often heard from

174
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Career Army men who detested McNamera's lowering of enlistment standards in order to bring low IQ men into the ranks.

175
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So we always, well, no, we always.

176
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
This is something that comes up all the time today too, right?

177
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
We're always concerned about lowering the standards for things.

178
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Because when you start to lower the standards and there for a reason,

179
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
start to lower the standards and we don't know what's going to happen.

180
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I think that's the scariest thing about lowering standards.

181
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Is that you, you don't know, you don't know what's going to happen.

182
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You just know what has worked and even when things you say they quote worked,

183
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
you know that those things have been stressed and sometimes they didn't work all that well and maybe the standard should have been higher.

184
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So now we're going to lower them.

185
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Yeah, but concerning thing to do a lot of times, or

186
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I don't know what that means, but the thought behind it is lowering standards because we need more people.

187
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Well, that's what I think, right?

188
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So it's like a, it's like a, this constant balancing act because sure you can have more people,

189
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000
but you can't lower the standards all the way down so that more people actually hurt because there are a month people who are incapable, whatever.

190
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
That's the point.

191
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Yeah, so I see the under like, because what if your standards are too high?

192
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Like no one can meet the standards, so now you got one guy here for three guys and they can't do the job because there's only three of them.

193
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So let's get some, you know, some other guys doing some other stuff, we're sure that, you know, one of these three guys could probably do the job of eight of these other guys,

194
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
but they're over here doing, you know, busy doing other stuff, so let's get eight more guys.

195
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You know, but when they started getting each other's way.

196
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Yeah, and then we got a, I guess the question is really.

197
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Where do you draw the line?

198
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Yeah.

199
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And that's what's hard to figure out.

200
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Yes, sir.

201
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Because, well, like I said, you have your standards and you think, well, we kind of have survived with these standards for four wars, right?

202
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
They kind of worked and all of a sudden we're going to know, you know what? We're actually going to lower these standards.

203
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That's a move to make.

204
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Yeah.

205
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Especially, and this is very common for McNamara to just make decisions and impose things without consulting the front line troops that actually have to train and then go fight alongside these people that are not capable.

206
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
A little bit more about boot camp here.

207
00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:08.000
They began at 430. They was filled with exercise instruction, menial chores, all accompanied by incest and shouting and insult. We were called a variety of disparaging names, including shit heads, assholes, pussy, scumbags, line balls, pansies and coerce.

208
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
One verbally clever sergeant would refer to a poorly performing training as a sad sack of shit or an idiotic turd.

209
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Or he would tell him that whale shit at the bottom of the, is at the bottom of the ocean and you're lower than whale shit.

210
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And night we got a little sleep. We're supposed to go to bed at 10 o'clock, but it's things turned out we were up until 1230, which meant we only got four hours of sleep.

211
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Some nights we didn't even get four hours of sleep. If we had to pull fireguard duty, we'd spend an hour patrolling inside and outside the barracks watching for fire, then we would wake up on replacement. There's a bunch of interesting information about boot camp.

212
00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And then he says, I learned that Captain Bosch wanted to read as many of us members of the Muck squad as possible because they threatened to pull down the company average for the end of basic training tests, which is, this is pretty typical of the military where there's some weird.

213
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And then the rule or some weird goal that causes all of these unintended circumstances. Like, okay, we're going to judge you. We'll give a company award for the best PT scores and then people start running people out of the company and not training them.

214
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
That's unintended consequences in the military is always I always got a chuck a lot of them, but it happens in every industry.

215
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So that's where you got to be aware of them. So here's this guy that you know the commanding general or whoever the regimental commander, I thought, I want to see, I want to really have something to strive for. Let's give let's give the best companies PT scores on award.

216
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
We'll give him a stream around their flag. Yeah, that'll be great.

217
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
So now you just got these these leaders just getting rid of people.

218
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So that's what happens. Here's a little bit more scaringness for a week or so, a sergeant was assigned to a company guped in at the rifle range.

219
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I overheard the sergeant telling other sergeant that guped and should absolutely never be allowed to handle loaded weapons on his own.

220
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:12.000
All the sergeants agreed that big trouble would happen in the weeks ahead when we train he's simulated combat with such maneuvers as fire and movement.

221
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
In which you advance in parallel lines with a partner through an assault course while your partner ran ahead you provided cover fire.

222
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Then he drops to the ground and provided cover fire for you as you ran ahead and so on down the field.

223
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:38.000
The sergeants foresaw disaster. So this guy's not even being able to be capable of the fundamental rudimentary tactic of war which is cover move.

224
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Here this is where you can see that that Gregory's having some issues on one of these forced marches is getting called a damn pussy.

225
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Get back up and run like a man.

226
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
This continues on after we marched an hour or so.

227
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I got heat cramps in my shoulders and became dizzy and nauseated at one rest stop. I took a swig of water from my canteen which made me vomit.

228
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Floaling which again is one of his buddies came over and felt my forehead which he said was burning up. He summoned sergeant Boone who splashed cool water on my face.

229
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Then the light my load the sergeant carried my rifle while flew well and carried my pack and we continued our march.

230
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:26.000
When we arrived at the rifle range I felt sick and dizzy and had and I was parched and I walked to a patch of glass laid down and blanked out.

231
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Next thing I knew as an ambulance headed toward the hospital medic was taking my temperature which was 105 when we got to the hospital.

232
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:42.000
My temperature was 105 I was stripped down and dunked into a big hospital tub filled with ice and water. I was kept in the hospital for a few days and then released back to Bravo company.

233
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:58.000
But while I was gone, Captain Boosh had secured permission to have me sent to special training company because I had missed key days of training and needed quote rehabilitation for being recycled to another basic training company.

234
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
So he's got the opportunity to get rid of this guy that's slow and not the best to shape and he gets put in this special training company.

235
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
So let's fast forward a little bit to this special training company.

236
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000
When I arrived at special training company I was taken to the orderly room to be interviewed by the first sergeant undoubtedly influenced by my goofy face.

237
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
He said we got to fill out some paperwork. Can you read and write?

238
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Gregor replies I hope so I said on a college graduate. He gave me a surprise look. He was just one of the many who pre-judged me because I appear to be adult.

239
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I smiled and said I bet you I thought I bet you thought I was one of McNamara's morons. He gritted said we got a lot of morons here. We don't need anymore.

240
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000
When I told him I wanted to pass through special training and finish basic. It's quickly as possible. He seemed pleased and we ended up having a friendly conversation.

241
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
There were about a hundred men in special training. Most of whom had failed basic training because they possessed one or more of these attributes.

242
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Menally slow, weak, inept, overweight or psychologically troubled.

243
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Also present were trainees who were convalescing from injuries.

244
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Whereas physical training occupied about 40% of our active and basic training, it consumed 90% in special training company.

245
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000
We were supposed to get instruction that would help us with the rifle and test and the G3 proficiency test, but there was very little assistance.

246
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Low IQ men were supposed to get remedial reading lessons, but I saw no evidence of such training at special training. It was PT all day every day.

247
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:43.000
After I stood my gear in a wall locker, I joined the company which was on the PT field struggling with the most excruciating physical torment I have ever endured in my life.

248
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Intensive log drills.

249
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:55.000
He goes on to talk about log PT, actually has a picture of seals in here doing log PT because if you don't know that's a huge part of not a huge part.

250
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
It's a substantial part of basic seal training.

251
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
We call it log PT.

252
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Is that the log PT? Mainly.

253
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Because they're not really exercises, they're just like, we want to introduce this log to your whole thing to make everything hard or is it actually a program?

254
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
We want to work out.

255
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
What he says here is the drill is nothing but torture involving no true rehabilitation or strengthening.

256
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
That's what he says. Maybe that answer your question.

257
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:39.000
But when you do it in Buds, it's definitely like it's teamwork and strength.

258
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So you have a log, it's basically a small telephone pole, maybe it's probably 15 feet long or something like that.

259
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Maybe 10 feet long, do you ever take it in the water?

260
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Oh yeah. Do the float? You take it in the water, you take it through the obstacle course.

261
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Because water is not a huge part of it.

262
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
It would have to float, otherwise you would drown.

263
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
But you know how there's different, okay, so in quite we have logs too, we mess with or whatever in the water.

264
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
But sometimes if they're super dry, they'll float float.

265
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
They're a little bit too soon.

266
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
But if they're not, they'll kind of float, but if you get on it, it'll sink and it's a pain in that.

267
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
It's much more land device.

268
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Yeah, but you do, like you, you all put it on your left shoulder, then you just squats.

269
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Then you do overhead press and you hold it up there.

270
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And then you do like left shoulder, right shoulder overhead press it.

271
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
And then you do lay down, you do sit-ups where that you do.

272
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So you just any kind of PT, channel, scenics, because it's like,

273
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It's just a little bit of a program there. Like where it's like, okay.

274
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Yeah, like you do push-ups, you lay down, you do like bench press with it.

275
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah, you know, then you do push-ups on it.

276
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
And then you do sit-ups. I remember doing sit-ups, because I remember they said sit-ups.

277
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And I was kind of thinking, how are you going to do a sit-up for the log?

278
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
But yeah, you just all lay there, put it across your chest, and do sit-ups.

279
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
With it across your chest.

280
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
With it across your chest.

281
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So let's think a little piece of work out equipment.

282
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
It's a big piece of work out equipment.

283
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So do you ever, and if I thought it was you, you might even have said this,

284
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
but I don't know, clarify it.

285
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
So have you ever, do they ever say, hey, just bring this log, you guys?

286
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
You know, like, if you're going to the, I don't know, what you're going to do.

287
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
So you would meet for log-p to you.

288
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Okay, so it's a lot.

289
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So it's a lot.

290
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And then one for a while, they had a log that was called old misery.

291
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
That was a lot.

292
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
That sounds bad.

293
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Way thicker than the other logs.

294
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And so if your boat crew was doing bad, they'd give you old misery.

295
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And I guess now they have an even better log, which is it's a log,

296
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
but it's cut up into pieces and tied together with a rope.

297
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Oh, yeah.

298
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So each piece, so they can tell who's put now and who's not.

299
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
So you just, you know, you've got your 50 pound chunk or whatever.

300
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
You know, if there's, if it's one continuous log,

301
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
and I'm under it and you're under it and there's five other people under it,

302
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
it's kind of hard to tell who's put now and who's not.

303
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Yeah.

304
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Yeah.

305
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
That log that's all grown in the middle.

306
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah.

307
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
In the middle, you're kind of cruising, right?

308
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You can't be.

309
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
You could be.

310
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
You probably could be.

311
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So now they have this log that's cut up.

312
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Yeah.

313
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And yet attached.

314
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
So let's see how you're looking now with that part of your log.

315
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
It's sagging.

316
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Isn't that psychologically,

317
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
but you know, it might do the opposite.

318
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Because psychologically, like if it's all one log and you kind of can't tell who's

319
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
putting out and who's not, doesn't that kind of add to the team building experience

320
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
where you kind of got to trust the guy?

321
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Yes.

322
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
But let's say, they didn't have that log.

323
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
They didn't have either one of those logs.

324
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
When I went through, we didn't have old misery log and we didn't have this cut-up log.

325
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Yeah.

326
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
But so I don't know.

327
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
But you feel, you know, you should feel peer pressure to like lift.

328
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
But let's say you were an instructor.

329
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yeah.

330
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And you're watching this boat crew kind of, kind of fail.

331
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And you're wondering, hey, who in this boat crew is actually getting after it?

332
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Right.

333
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And who's not.

334
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Yeah.

335
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Hey, go grab this cut-up log.

336
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Yeah, we're going to say we're going to find out real quick.

337
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Yeah.

338
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
That's the thing, man.

339
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.000
That training makes you, it figures out what your weaknesses are.

340
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
That's interesting because it's that really illustrates the two separate elements of

341
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
buds and training and stuff where it's like the instructor's perspective and then the

342
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
the, the user, the person, right?

343
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Is the candidate, what do you call the cadet?

344
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
The cadet.

345
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Sure.

346
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
That's legitimately called tadpoles.

347
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I got a baby frog.

348
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
So it really clarifies that those did the difference in perspective because look, if I'm a little guy who's

349
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
not very strong and I, and each one of our, and I'm, and we got the cut-up log and everybody and you know, you got,

350
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I don't know, how many guys in a year and a boat crew with other guys that are your same height or very similar.

351
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
A couple inches difference.

352
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Okay.

353
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
So let's say my strength is it strength.

354
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
It's just, you're running.

355
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
You're something like this, yeah, but now the functionality that is as a team kind of breaks down a little bit.

356
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
A little bit.

357
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
The user perspective.

358
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Here's the deal.

359
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
If you're my swim buddy, you're my boat crew, we're together.

360
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I know you're a fast runner and I know that you're not that, as strong as you could be.

361
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
But you're a good guy.

362
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Guess what?

363
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Come on man, we got this.

364
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Yeah.

365
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
What if you're a turd?

366
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And I'm like, hey dude, you aren't putting out.

367
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So it does help develop, it helps identify people that aren't good teammates.

368
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Yeah.

369
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Because if you're a fast runner, you might be like, hey, juggle.

370
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
You know, let's say I'm a slow runner.

371
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
I'm stronger than you, but you're faster than me.

372
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Yeah.

373
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Hey juggle, I'll pay you on this run.

374
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
And you help me, you push me.

375
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Right.

376
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
That's the thing.

377
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
You're going to have good days and bad days.

378
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Good days and bad days.

379
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
You're also going to have strengths and weaknesses.

380
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Everyone is.

381
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Yeah.

382
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
So there's no one.

383
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I'm trying to think.

384
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
There's just about no one that goes through buds that just doesn't have any issues.

385
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Yeah.

386
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
They're going to find because hey, you might be a really fast runner, but you get cold.

387
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000
You know, you might be really good at the obstacle course, but you get cold.

388
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
You might be a really good swimmer, but you get cold.

389
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
You see what I'm saying?

390
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
They're going to find something.

391
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And the cold thing is funny because, but I think that's what makes a lot of people

392
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
quit is just being cold and uncomfortable and miserable.

393
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Yeah.

394
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
And that warmth.

395
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Yeah.

396
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That warmth.

397
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
But it's so temporary.

398
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
It's just freaking lie.

399
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Yeah.

400
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
I can understand.

401
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:42.000
But there's very few people that don't have a problem with some area of buds.

402
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
They don't want, maybe that's strong.

403
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
There's a decent amount of people that have that are like, oh, I was kind of okay and everything.

404
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

405
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Okay.

406
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Believe me.

407
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I'm not trying to say it was good.

408
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I definitely wasn't great or anything.

409
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
I definitely wasn't.

410
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
But I was kind of okay.

411
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And there were some people that were more okay than me at everything.

412
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
So there's people that kind of, but if you're really good, here's the, here's, I guess, where comes the if you're really good at one thing.

413
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Chances are you're not going to be really good at everything.

414
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
There were some guys in my class that were really good at just about everything.

415
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
They might have one or two things that they weren't great at, but they were usually pretty small.

416
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I mean, my honor man, a guy named Keith Camira, he was pretty much good at everything.

417
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
He was a stud in the water, he was fast, he was awesome at the, of course, but I will say this.

418
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Even the, like the guys that were really good at everything, they would vary, they actually wouldn't be.

419
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
They wouldn't be the best at something.

420
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
They wouldn't be like, oh, this guy, we're going to win the runs by a record number.

421
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Or this guy's going to do the, oh course in a record number.

422
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
There might be a guy that's just, hey, I swam in college and that guy's just going to crush the swims.

423
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Yeah, you know, where we, we're looking for him on the rug, so he's on the same.

424
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Right.

425
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
But that's kind of what I'm saying with the cut-up log versus the full log.

426
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
So it's like, hey, you're a good teammate.

427
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
You want to pick up the slack for this guy and he's going to be, you can't pick up, it's hard to pick up the slack.

428
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
On the cut-up log.

429
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Definitely harder.

430
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So I'm saying, so I look this poor guy who's great at swimming, great at running.

431
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
And then, but he's this little skinnier or whatever. He's helpful.

432
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And he, if you got a full log, a connected log, it's like, hey, let's all do this together.

433
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I'm going to trust you to put out what you can.

434
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And that would be the standard occasionally.

435
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
This is what I imagine triggered us because again, they didn't have this kind of log when I went through.

436
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
What I think would trigger this is, you see a boat crew that's now yelling at each other.

437
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Now we got, now we got a problem.

438
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Let's see what's going on for real.

439
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Because a lot of times, not a lot of times.

440
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
It can definitely happen that the guy that's yelling at everybody is the guy that's not put now.

441
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
It doesn't that kind of work both ways though.

443
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So like, yeah, if you got, what if I'm weak in the cut-up log?

444
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And I can't do these reps the way these other guys can.

445
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
But if you're a good teammate versus a bad teammate, that's going to show regardless.

446
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
If you're a bad teammate, put it this way.

447
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Because you see a guy and he's like, he's pointing it out as much as he can.

448
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
He's physically weaker than everybody.

449
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And I start yelling at him.

450
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
That's bad.

451
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
You know, unless you're encouraging him.

452
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Here's the thing, I think that people get shit, get what's the jammed up.

453
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Damn it.

454
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Up during the jail training is good and then structured know this.

455
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Like, let's say you and I are in a boat crew, right?

456
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
And we probably would have been in boat crew, because you're 5-11 on 5-11, right?

457
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
So we're in a boat crew and you're sick, or you have cramps.

458
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Or maybe you're just not strong at, you know, maybe your neck is hurt.

459
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Yeah.

460
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
And so we're getting told to do something and you can't do it.

461
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
And you're like, I can't hold this boat on my head right now.

462
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
I can't do this anymore, right?

463
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
The instructors see that and they go over and they go, oh, you know what they start saying to you?

464
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
You're holding back the team.

465
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Yeah.

466
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
The team doesn't want you.

467
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
You're going to make them lose.

468
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
When they lose, they're going to get hammered by us.

469
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
We're going to crush them.

470
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
It's all going to be your fault.

471
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
They're getting in that person's head and it works.

472
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And that person goes, my quit.

473
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
I don't want to be a detriment to the team, right?

474
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
So they quit.

475
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
It's a lie.

476
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
It's actually a lie.

477
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Because everyone, every one of those guys and buds,

478
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
going to have a time where they're like, oh, this isn't my strength right now.

479
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And I need somebody help me with whatever.

480
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Maybe they got like heinous shit.

481
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
There's just things are going to happen.

482
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And well, to a lot of people, to a lot of people, things are going to happen.

483
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Where they're feeling like, oh my God.

484
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I'm trying to think, I don't think I actually was ever in that bad of a situation during

485
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Buds, where I was like, got a carry me across the line or whatever.

486
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
But I saw it happen to people.

487
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
And sometimes they would get in those, and it was okay.

488
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
You know, it's a man, don't worry.

489
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
We got you.

490
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Hey, just hang on.

491
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Well, well, like someone's freezing all cut all around them to like, to like get them warm.

492
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Stuff like that, you know?

493
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
That's what you're trying to do.

494
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Now if the person's a piece of shit, you're kind of like,

495
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Dude, you look a little jelly on there.

496
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
It's just sort of like a little selection going on.

497
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
There's a little class selection, even though it's not formal, like in Ranger School,

498
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
they do peer evaluations.

499
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
We have to rank everyone in the class and like the last person's getting dropped.

500
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
If they got a couple times in a row, and I forget to actually rules because I never went through Ranger School.

501
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
But if they rank Eccletrails, number 48, again, bottom of the list.

502
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Oh, there's Eccletrails again.

503
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
We're getting rid of them.

504
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And so they actually rotate through them.

505
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Okay, rank me last this time, rank Eccletrails next time.

506
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
And so that if you do it smart, if you work together, you can no one gets dropped.

507
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
No one gets peered out.

508
00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
In seal training, they don't really have that except for what I'm just talking about,

509
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
which is looking at a guy going, oh, we don't want to help him right now.

510
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah.

511
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
In his moment of weakness.

512
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
It's handled internally.

513
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It's handled internally.

514
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
All right, here we go.

515
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Let's get back to the book, Speaking of this, there's various tests.

516
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
He talks about these tests that they have to pass that has a bunch of different components.

517
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
It's got like a low crawl that you got to make.

518
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
You got to do these monkey bars.

519
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
You got to do this.

520
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
This sprint jump over trenches type thing.

521
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
There's a grenade throw.

522
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
They got and then a mile run.

523
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
So that they have a test that they have to pass to get out of this training company.

524
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And he talks about the various things and what would make people fail.

525
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
But one of the things he said is he says to succeed in the mile run,

526
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
you obviously needed endurance, but you also needed problem solving ability.

527
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
At the beginning, some of the men would sprint as if they were running 100 yard dashes.

528
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
It's causing them to become out of breath and tired.

529
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
They would slow down and struggle for the rest of the mile.

530
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
They couldn't grasp or apply what the sergeants told them about the need to maintain a steady pace throughout the entire mile.

531
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
For most of the men in special training company passing the test was impossible.

532
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Their low mental capacity doomed them to failure.

533
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
They could never pass.

534
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Under military rules, they were supposed to stay at special training until they passed all requirements for graduation from basic.

535
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So what was going to happen to them?

536
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Would the army keep them in the company until their service time came to an end?

537
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Or would they be discharged and sent home?

538
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Or horrible to imagine, would there be cheating?

539
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Of the kind that Captain Bosch had used in Bravo Company to send them on to Vietnam?

540
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So you got this special training company in order to get out of there.

541
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
You got to pass the basic requirements to get out of basic training.

542
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
And then you can go back to your company and complete.

543
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
And we already got an example of Captain Bosch.

544
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I was like, oh, we're going to get rid of some of these guys.

545
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And there's another incident that he talked about where there's various forms of cheating that they did to get someone a better PT score.

546
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Get someone to pass a test.

547
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So that's happening.

548
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Again, it's unintended consequence of this whole training program.

549
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Yeah.

550
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
He says here, while most of the men did poorly on the PT test because they were limited mentally,

551
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
this was not the case with Charles Lassner, who is very intelligent but two week and clumsy to pass.

552
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
He was about six one, had long spindly legs and he was unable to jump across the ditch and the run and dodged jump.

553
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
When he ran through the course, he took short dainty steps and he was too uncordinated to make the leap.

554
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
There was something about Lassner that elicited fierce hatred from the sergeants.

555
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
They hounded him constantly calling him a queer and a pansy.

556
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
During the training day, he was screamed out more than anyone else.

557
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And in the evenings, he was always given log drills as punishment.

558
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Finally, he couldn't take it anymore.

559
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
At lunchtime one day, he sat on his bunk and declined to fall out for afternoon formation.

560
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
I tried to coax him into getting up, but he said, I can't take any more of this shit.

561
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
He seemed deeply depressed.

562
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
A sergeant appeared in order to join the company, but he refused.

563
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
The sergeant fetched the company commander, Captain Brown, who gave him a direct order to get off the bunk,

564
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
and joined the company on the PT field.

565
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Again, Lassner refused the MPs were summoned, and they arrested him and took him to the stock aid we never saw him again.

566
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:31.000
I later heard that he was court-martialed and sentenced to four years hard labor in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

567
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Lassner's refusal to train must have caught the attention of high-ranking officers at Fort Benning,

568
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
because a few days after the event of full-bird Colonel visited the company.

569
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Captain Brown assembled us in front of the Colonel and said that we were fortunate to have him with us,

570
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
because he was a combat veteran of World War II, and he had important things to say to us.

571
00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:03.000
The Colonel proceeded to give us a motivational talk. He was a white-haired, distinguished-looking officer, and he seemed sincere and concerned.

572
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Without making any reference to Lassner's deed, he exorbed us to fulfill our duties and fight to guarantee the liberties enjoyed by our families and friends.

573
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Our nation was involved in a conflict between the forces of freedom and the forces of darkness.

574
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000
In city, as totalitarian, communist wanted to enslave us and trample upon our rights, we must be strong men, obedient men,

575
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:33.000
and we must be willing to sacrifice like Washington's troops did at Valley Forge in the darkest days of the Revolutionary War,

576
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
or like Eisenhower troops did on the beaches of Normandy.

577
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
He continued in this vein, and as he spoke, I glanced at the men near me.

578
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
They were looking at the speaker respectfully, but I knew that most of them were not comprehending his concepts.

579
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
It was a bit comical, as well as a bit sad.

580
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Here was a well-meaning World War II veteran who seemed unaware of the intelligence level of most of his listeners,

581
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
talking about patriotism and other abstractions to men who had no idea of what he was talking about.

582
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:24.000
I probably should have covered there's just so many incidents that he covers in here that kind of identifies the mental capacity of the people that he's dealing with.

583
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
That's one example, but there's really other obvious ones.

584
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
He talked about not being able to tell you that you're not being able to read and write.

585
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
They're just don't have the cognitive capacity to do this stuff.

586
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
And that was sort of the crux of it.

587
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
This World War II veteran coming down and delivering this eloquent speech that the guys just don't understand it.

588
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Just doesn't mean anything to them.

589
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Fast forward a little bit. He says after a few weeks, it's special training.

590
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
I took the final PT test and passed it easily. I was recycled to a new company where I picked up where I'd left off with Bravo Company.

591
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I finished basic training with my new company and then I went to US Army Intelligence School.

592
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
While I was there, I happened to run into a man who had been at special training as a convalescent while he recuperated from a hand-in-st injury.

593
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
He informed me that all of the men I had known at special training had been, quote, administratively past and quote,

594
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:38.000
and sent on to advanced training. He said that the company commander had been ordered to certify that the men were malingers who could have passed the final test if they truly wanted to.

595
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Just to give you a little bit more of his story says after intelligence school, I went to Vietnam,

596
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
but I had no contact with project 100,000 men because I served as an Army Intelligence agent.

597
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Wearing civilian clothes and using a fake name, I posted a journalist and worked on a team that recruited and trained agents for espionage missions in Cambodia,

598
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
a country from which communist forces launched attacks on American forces,

599
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
while as in Vietnam, I continued to write letters to members of Congress.

600
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000
And I had one moment of success. He started writing letters to Congress and, hey, these guys do not should not be in the military,

601
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
and they definitely shouldn't be sent to combat. He says,

602
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:25.000
and a to Robert Cender Robert Kennedy wrote me that he was moved by my descriptions of the low IQ men was urging the Senate to hold a hearing on project 100,000.

603
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
I eagerly watched the mail for a letter detailing plans by Senator Kennedy,

604
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:42.000
but one morning in June 1968 I heard news that Kennedy had been assassinated. I suspect that my only chance for congressional action had died with the Senator. I was correct.

605
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
A few years after the war ended, I arranged to get a computer print out listing all the names of Americans who died in Vietnam.

606
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I skimmed the list looking for the last names that matched the names of men I had known at before bending.

607
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Unfortunately, the death list included the names of two men I had known at special training company, Ernesto, Lizano, and Freddie Hensley.

608
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Lizano was a man I didn't know very well. The only thing I remembered about him was that some of the sergeants had given him the nickname, Retardo.

609
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Freddie Hensley, of course, I knew well. I was not surprised to discover that he had been killed in combat with his good looks. He probably was assumed to be normal.

610
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:37.000
And moved along to Vietnam and sent out the field and I didn't cover that part, but Freddie Hensley was a guy that looked very, like a handsome guy, normal looking guy, and but he was just, he just wasn't very intellectually capable.

611
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:46.000
He says, Freddie's death hit me hard. I remembered how he was always signed, an indication of the tremendous anxiety he experienced in special training.

612
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:56.000
I remembered how he lacked the mental quickness to qualify with the M14 rifle. I felt enormous anger, which I still feel decades later. He never should have been drafted.

613
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
He never should have been administratively pasted special training. He never should have been sent in a combat.

614
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Grasping at straws, I got to thinking that maybe there was another man named Freddie Hensley who died, so I tried to find his family by telephoning people in his hometown with the last name, the same last name.

615
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:25.000
I eventually made contact with his mother and ascertained that Freddie, the Freddie I had known, was indeed the man who died in Vietnam.

616
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I told her that I had been Freddie's friend at Fort Benning. She said that she and the family were proud that Freddie had given his life to defend his country.

617
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
As we talked, I carefully introduced my belief that Freddie should not have been sent into combat.

618
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Before long, she was expressing grief and anger and bewilderment. She told me that when Freddie received his draft notice, she and other family members went to the induction center,

619
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:08.000
and explained that Freddie had been an EMR, edgicable, mentally retarded, classes at school, and had not been able to drive a car, and that it was a mistake to draft him.

620
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:19.000
In response to Drill Sergeant Reassured, the family that Freddie would not be put into danger, he would just do menial jobs such as sweeping floors and peeling potatoes.

621
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:37.000
He was a good boy, she said, when he was little, we used to go everywhere together, he was my little man. She began to sob and she lamented, why did they have to draft him? I want to know why.

622
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:52.000
So now we get into the part of the book that answers that question, why, why was this happening? The sections about project 100,000, and it gets some really interesting information.

623
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:10.000
I usually, when we have Vietnam guys on here, I always probe this area of, what was it like? What was the protest like? I've never had anybody talk too deeply about, hey, this was this dynamic environment, this polarizer.

624
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:31.000
I don't really, it seems like because there wasn't social media because there wasn't 24-hour news cycle, if you lived in Ohio, and you were going to join the army, you only saw the other people in Ohio, and probably the people that you hung out with were like, yeah, well, you're joining the army, you're from Ohio and where Americans are, we're joining the army, oh, you got drafted cool.

625
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:42.000
It was like, it seems like there was less connection, but it's interesting to hear some of these statistics that he talks about here and the way they saw looked and the way they saw washed out.

626
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And the other thing is we have guys that either got drafted and said Roger that or they joined up either way.

627
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So, here we go, yes, the majority of Americans who served in Vietnam were technically volunteers. Some were indeed true volunteers, such as the idealistic patriotic youths described.

628
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:16.000
But most of them volunteered only because of the way the draft was carried out. Local draft boards or military recruiters told them that they were likely to be drafted soon and they had two choices.

629
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:32.000
It's submit to the draft and serve two years, probably in combat or they could volunteer and serve three years in non-combat MOS, which is a military occupational specialty like mechanic cook or computer programmer.

630
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Most men chose the second, say for option, because the vast majority of them would never have enlisted if the draft had not been in place, but in place it would be more accurate to call them draft induced volunteers.

631
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And he says, I was in another category, which I called draft influenced volunteer. My local draft board put me on a list of possible drafts, but my family doctor told me without any prompting on my part that I could,

632
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
that I could avoid the draft, if you wrote a letter to the draft board, about a pre-existing medical condition.

633
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Hyper-fioratism. I declined his offer because the draft boards interest in me woke out of my, woke me out of my adolescent days and forced me to take a hard look at the issues.

634
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Because I was a strong believer in America's fight against communism, I decided that it was my patriotic duty to serve, so I signed up for three years in the army with a promise of an interesting assignment, military intelligence.

635
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:43.000
But I make no claim to be a hero, I did not volunteer for infantry. So there's got people getting drafted, you got people getting told, hey, you're gonna get drafted bro, you might just, so they never would have enlisted voluntarily.

636
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:51.000
I know, yeah, he volunteered. Hey, echo, you can need a volunteer or you can possibly take this job over here, what's going to get you in the combat.

637
00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And if you don't want to go to combat, well, you're gonna, you're gonna sign up. So it's draft induced draft influenced some different things that happen.

638
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:16.000
And so I run some numbers here, he says, during the major years of the Vietnam era, 1964 to 1973, there were 26,800,000 draft age American males, 68% of whom never had to serve in the military.

639
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:23.000
They were excused because they were students or fathers or had physical limitations of some or some other disqualifying status.

640
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:35.000
So the whole freaking thing, I used to wander, I mean, when I was younger, well, why is going to college? How, how does that get you out of military service?

641
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
I don't get that, right? How does that work? Wait, you're going to college and now you can't go fight, why can't you fight?

642
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
And then it doesn't take much thinking to realize, oh, because my parents have money, they send me to college now and have to go fight.

643
00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:06.000
And you mentioned it earlier too, right, where that'll kind of make the general society unhappy, where it's like, hey, these are like, they have important roles in our society, because they're educated and all this stuff.

644
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Yeah, so if you set them to war, we don't have these people.

645
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:25.000
And also the middle class, so the middle class kids are going to college. So if you don't want to piss off the middle class parents, who are the ones that vote, what do you do? You say, hey, don't worry, don't worry about Johnny, as long as he's going to college isn't have to worry about signing up for the draft.

646
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Imagine back then, there's less people in college as well. Yeah, I'll tell the Vietnam War character often they find out they can get out of the draft and they're not letting it out. He said that left 30% to fill the ranks.

647
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Some signed up for Hazard's duty, but the majority managed to steer clear of the battlefield by going to the National Guard or Reserves, which in the Vietnam War were rarely used for combat, or by signing up for non combat positions in the Army Air Force Navy or Coast Guard.

648
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Some men spent their entire service in their entire service time in non lethal lokal such as the US, Germany, Korea and the Panama Canal zone.

649
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:21.000
So you could have enlisted and got any, any of these non-combat jobs. Ultimately, out of every 100 American males of draft age in the Vietnam area, era, only 12% of Vietnam.

650
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Of these 12 men, nine had non-combat support roles, but weren't entirely risk-free. They were potential targets of rocket, booby traps, terrorist attacks, mortars. The remaining three men.

651
00:53:35.000 --> 00:54:04.000
So out of 100 were down to three, the remaining three men served under fire in one of the following high risk situations. Fighting in one of the hardcore combat arms of the Army or Marine Corps infantry, artillery, army special operations, close air support, to serving in the dangerous positions in the Air Force Navy or Coast Guard such as combat aviators or patrol boat warriors, or three, trying to save lives in one of the most vulnerable of all battlefields.

652
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
So overall battlefield jobs combat medic.

653
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:21.000
While a few men were eager for combat, most were not Tony's any of Vietnam veterans who later became a forced arm general in the Marine Corps said it was hard to find Americans who actually chose and defyting Vietnam.

654
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Most who served there had to be forced to go.

655
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:45.000
So that's what we're dealing with. 28 million, 26 million people that are draft, 26 million men that were draft age. 68% never, they were, they were disqualified because they were students or physical limitations or fathers or some of the disqualifying status.

656
00:54:45.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Then you end up with a bunch of them that joined the National Guard or the Reserves which during Vietnam was kind of a way out of going to Vietnam. Then you got guys that joined in the non-combat role and eventually you get down to that small percentage of people that stepped up to fight.

657
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:14.000
There's a section here called avoidance. During the Vietnam war, almost all of the nation's affluent youth and a majority of the middle class escape the draft by going to college or claiming a disability or exemption.

658
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:40.000
A University of Notre Dame study estimated that 75% of excused men had actively tried to avoid the draft. Throughout the war years, many loopholes were available. One of the most famous cases involved actor George Hamilton who persuaded his draft board to give him a hard ship deferment because he was the sole support of his mother who lived in his Hollywood mansion and relied on his $200,000 annual income.

659
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Which would be $1.375 million in today's dollars. Men insert an occupation such as engineers, farmers, teachers, ministers and divinity students, one automatic exemptions.

660
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Fatherhood would could win a deferral. So a number of young men felt pressured to get married and start a family.

661
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.000
He has a little section here talking about peace children, which are basically guys that had kids so they didn't have to go to war.

662
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:13.000
A popular way to avoid the draft was to find a doctor who would attest to a medical problem such as flat feet, extreme allergies or skin rashes.

663
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:26.000
While he was a student at Harvard, writer James Fowlo's recalled sympathetic medical students helped us in helps us search for disqualifying conditions that we and are many good years of good health might have overlooked.

664
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:42.000
For $120 a young man could purchase a psychological disqualification. There are reputable anti-war psychiatrist who will put one through a series of personality test to find some tendencies they can distort and quote.

665
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
That's from a Harvard graduate undergraduate.

666
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Having a letter from a doctor was a sure way to win a medical exemption. For example, the induction center in Seattle, Washington divided men into two groups. Those who had letters from doctors and those that did not.

667
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Everyone with a letter got an exemption no matter what the letter said.

668
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:23.000
The induction center has really had the time to contest what an outside expert said using letters demonstrated the advantages held by middle class men who had easy access to sympathetic physician working class and poor men either had no such access or they were unaware that a doctor's letter was an option.

669
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Some men gained disqualifications by contriving to fail their pre-induction physical exams. A university of Michigan student ate three large peaches each night for six months so that he exceeded the military's weight limit for his height.

670
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000
He was disqualified. Some men jab their arms with needles to pass themselves off as heroin addicts.

671
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:56.000
He goes on talking about people that were getting or getting braces. I guess you weren't allowed to have braces so we'd get people dentists would charge a thousand a two thousand dollars which in today's money is between seven and fourteen thousand dollars to get braces put on. So now you don't get drafted.

672
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I didn't neighbor.

673
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:10.000
I told you this before. I didn't neighbor who she was older lady. I was like our neighbors mom or whatever. She said her brother.

674
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Dodge the draft by drinking soy sauce in gaining high blood pressure.

675
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:27.000
I was like a thing like and other people like his friends or whatever would do that as well.

676
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:41.000
But blood pressure is like that seems like something you can just sort of cure with like even like the weight thing. It's like proud just lose weight or whatever.

677
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:55.000
I was like, you know, you know, you're just a little bit like okay so I went to the doctor coincidentally to that just to get you know check up normal stuff and they take your blood pressure and the doctor said there's a thing called white coat syndrome.

678
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:07.000
I never did either until today and I was like, oh, what is that? It's like people's blood pressure will rise because they're just because they're nervous and the doctor's office. That's how blood pressure is. So now I'm thinking back.

679
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:28.000
I mean, you can I mean, you should braces, but these are some really low standard medical exemption scenarios. Nope. So in one hand, the bars really low. Well, that's the thing it's going to get lower. But I'll kind of high in a way is what I'm saying. Yeah, this is early though, right. This is this is also this is also.

680
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:48.000
They didn't they didn't lower this part of the bar, right? They lower the other parts of the bar. Right. So they made it so that some rich or middle class person that access to a to a freaking dentist and the money to pay for braces could all of a sudden get exempt.

681
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:58.000
But if you don't know about that little trick because you're from some place it doesn't have that kind of access or doesn't have that kind of money or doesn't have that kind of information.

682
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But no Google. How do I get out of the draft?

683
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It's a lot of that right in a way. I mean, that's a that's a spectrum to where like isn't that like a typical thing people might say about the criminal justice, right where it's like.

684
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You know, for the good lawyer kind of thing. Yeah, good lawyer makes it a good lawyer. Good lawyer. It makes a huge difference. A huge difference.

685
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:40.000
A few of access to that good lawyer as opposed to not having access to a good lawyer either because they you don't know about it or because you don't have the money for it. Yeah, for 100%.

686
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Check this out. Professional football players were virtually immune to being drafted.

687
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:57.000
In 1966, selective service grabbed the only two of 960 pro players, many of the West finding refuge in the national guard or reserves.

688
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:09.000
We have an arrangement with the Baltimore Colts major general George Gelsen Jr. of the Maryland National Guard said in 1966, when they have a player with a military problem, they send him to us.

689
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And quote, the Dallas Cowboys had 10 players assigned to the same national guard division at one time. This is a freaking scam.

690
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:30.000
The most sensational football star of the era, the New York Jets quarterback Joe Nameth was excused from service on grounds that his frequently injured knees made him unfit for combat.

691
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yet he continued to play bone crushing football on Sunday afternoons, by the way, three years after that he won the Super Bowl.

692
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And if a young man refused to submit to the draft, he was a he was subject to arrest and imprisonment to escape this fate over 40,000 American youths fled to countries that were willing to give them asylum, including Canada, Sweden and France.

693
01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:05.000
About 171,000 men refused to submit to the draft because they were conscientious objectives whose religious or moral beliefs forbade them to kill in any war or in the case of Vietnam war.

694
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:16.000
A war they considered unjust. Some of them were excused by local draft boards while about 96,000 agreed to alternative service in jobs such as medics.

695
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:26.000
An estimated 4,000 conscience to subjectors were given long prison terms usually five years.

696
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Yeah, and what's jacked up about that is if you're if you're honest and say look I don't want to go fight because I don't believe in the war. You're going to jail meanwhile someone that's getting braces is like clear.

697
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Some draft of orders felt remorse over their actions when he was 66 years old film and TV actor John Liffgow revealed that while he was in his 20s he won a disqualification by wearing urine soap clothes and pretending to be insane during a pre-induction interview.

698
01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:08.000
A sense of shame he said stay with me for years and has never entirely disappeared. Some of that shame had to do with the appalling suffering caused by the Vietnam war suffering that I so conveniently avoided.

699
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:22.000
An novelist Mark Helperon in an address at West Point in 1992 told the cadets that during the Vietnam war I dodged the draft and I was wrong. This is regret that I will carry to my grave.

700
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Former Vice President Dick Cheney who spent the war in college and graduate school sought and received five deferments from his draft board.

701
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Forced student deferments and one hardship deferment even though he was pro war. That's freaking unique isn't it?

702
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm pro war just not for me. Years later when he was one of the prime architects of the war in Iraq and was accused of being a hypocrite for sending thousands of men in the combat he justified his Vietnam Arab behavior in this way quote.

703
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I had other priorities in the 60s in military service. I don't regret the decisions I made and quote.

704
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Hmm. Okay.

705
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You don't regret the decisions you made. Got it. They're Dick.

706
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Reacting to comments by Cheney and other successful politicians Paul Marks a drafty in the Korean war wrote the Baltimore Sun quote for every draft of the voider.

707
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Someone else who's made to serve in order to meet the military's quotas that someone else might very well have been killed in Vietnam.

708
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Many of America's most accomplished young men were ready to pass the buck and let someone else someone less sophisticated and knowledgeable make this sacrifice as well. They pursued their personal ambitions and quote.

709
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Joining the National Guard of Reserves was a popular option because relatively few guardsmen are reserved as were sent to Vietnam.

710
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Again, this is totally different now. And National Garden Reserve were deployed all the time in Iraq and Afghanistan.

711
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Out of every one million men who enlist in the National Guard and reserves during the Vietnam era only 15,000 of them actually served in Vietnam.

712
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
That's a tiny percentage. Alan Vaneman who served in a combat artillery unit in Vietnam in 1968, 1969 said,

713
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I trained with several hundred country boys from Louisiana and Alabama who were bound for National Guard units.

714
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000
They were as they briefly put it, NG, not going.

715
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Some men who avoided the draft would later become prominent leaders such as Bill Clinton and Mitt Romney.

716
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But in fairness, it should be noted that a few young men who later became National Leaders served in Vietnam and risked their lives.

717
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:57.000
For example, three men who were members of US Senate at the same time, Chuck Hagle, John Kerry and John McCain were decorated heroes of combat Vietnam.

718
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It says here, although some affluent men suffered in Vietnam, the typical infantry platoon was made up of minorities, the poor and the working class with a sprinkling of middle class youth.

719
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:23.000
San Antonio lawyer, Mori Maverick Jr., recalled that during the war, my friend at the local office of the American Friends Service Committee placed across on the map of San Antonio at the home address of each person killed in combat.

720
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
On the west side where the Mexican Americans lived, there was a sea of crosses.

721
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:39.000
In Alamo Heights, almost park and tarry hills where the rich people lived, there were virtually no crosses at all.

722
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Most of America's privilege-delete seemed unbothered by the unfair burden placed on men on the lower rungs of society, but there were some leaders who were angry and indigged it.

723
01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:01.000
In 1966, Kingman Bruster, the president of Yale University, used his address to the graduating seniors to denounce a system that had drafted, quote,

724
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:10.000
only those who cannot hide in the endless catacombs of formal education.

725
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So, yeah, that's friggin'.

726
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Just, this is y'all, figure this shit.

727
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
This is going into McNamara's plan.

728
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:36.000
The year is 1966 was crunch time for the American military because so many middle-class American males were avoiding the draft military face the prospect of serious manpower shortages.

729
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Because most of the men did not volunteer to extend their tour of duty, thousands of fresh troops had to be deployed to Vietnam every month through a place the thousands that were departing.

730
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
To supply extra troops that were urgently needed President Johnson was faced with a tough choice.

731
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Here you go, President Johnson.

732
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.000
He could have revoked student deferments and forced thousands of college boys into the army, or he could have used the one million men in the National Garden Reserves.

733
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But either action would have angered the vote-powerful middle-class, so instead he turned to the working class and the poor.

734
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Got a shit bird.

735
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Here, however, you also found trouble rounding up enough eligible men.

736
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
There are plenty of men of the right age in the poorer neighborhoods, but many of them have flunked the military's entrance exam.

737
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
The Armed Forces qualification test, that's what I kicked the podcast off with.

738
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Johnson and Defense Secretary McNamara desperately needed them, however, so they lowered the standards for passing the AFQT.

739
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Suddenly, thousands of low aptitude men once declared unacceptable because of low AFQT stores scores when else subject to the draft.

740
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Johnson and McNamara tried to make their action appear to be based on humanitarian compassion.

741
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:59.000
With much fanfare at the 1966 Natural Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, McNamara unveiled his plan to salvage and rehabilitate a new world.

742
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Re-evalitate 100,000 substandard men each year hence the official title project 100,000.

743
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Though the man may have failed in these subjects in school, they wouldn't fail now because the military was, quote,

744
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
The World's greatest educator of skilled manpower.

745
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And quote, McNamara once considered one of the most brilliant men in America.

746
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:37.000
He had made a name for himself as one of the WIS kids who revitalized Ford Motor Company, believed that he could raise the intelligence of low ability men through a use of video tapes and close circuit TV lessons.

747
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Quote, an aloe aptitude student can use video tapes as an aid to his formal instruction and end by becoming as proficient as a high aptitude student and quote.

748
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
In his story, I'd believe that video tapes could dramatically transform slow learners.

749
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:09.000
McNamara was revealing the same blind faith in the power of technology that diluted him into thinking that he could outsmart the enemy in Vietnam by using calculators computers in statistical analysis.

750
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:18.000
According to biographer Deborah Shapley, McNamara was, quote, a naive believer in technological mirrors, miracles and quote.

751
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:27.000
An announcing project 100,000 McNamara never said a word about combat to hear him what a would have thought men were going not off the war but off the school.

752
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:37.000
In his view, the military was doing them a favor when they got out of the service they would have valuable skills and self-confidence with which they could get good paying jobs in the civilian market.

753
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's leading advocate leading advocate of this program.

754
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a sociologist who later became a US senator from New York who's argument went like this. The best way to solve poverty in America is to draft the hundreds of thousands of young men being rejected annually as unfit for military service.

755
01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Take inner city blacks and poor rural whites both groups tending to be lazy and fond of booze and put them into uniform.

756
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Real discipline trained them to bathe daily, salute and take orders teach them a marketable skill at the end of the couple years you'll have transformed lazy unmotivated slackers into hard working law biding citizens.

757
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Shits unbelievable, right?

758
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Now there was push back. There was push back from the uniformed military. So you got Mac and Mara who's the secretary defense, you know, he's a civilian but he's presenting this great plan and the leadership inside the military was going hey this shitting and work.

759
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And Mac and Mara tells Johnson Mac and Mara told Johnson that uniformed officers in the defense department were opposed to drafting low apt to men because quote, they don't want to be in the business of dealing with morons and moron camps.

760
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The army doesn't want to be thought of as a rehabilitation agency and a quote.

761
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But Mac and Mara who's a fucking arrogant guy and thinks he's smart just pushes this program anyways.

762
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Between October 1st in 1966 and December 31st 1971, which is the day to the official program project 100,000, took in some 354,000 men 91% of them based on lowered mental standards, they're remaining 9% because of left's less stringent physical standards.

763
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:44.000
100,000 men were on average 20 years old. Half came from the south 41% were minorities. Some 46% were drafties while the remaining 54% were volunteers.

764
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:56.000
However, as I pointed out earlier, the term volunteers misleading military recruiters would get the names of low scoring men who were now acceptable to the armed forces and visit them to steer them toward the three year hitch.

765
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The recruiters would tell them if they waited for the draft they'd only served two years but almost certainly end up in an infantry tune and be a non.

766
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:18.000
But if they signed up for three years they would be assigned to a non-combat job. There was however a big catch. The military did not have to honor any oral promises made by a recruiter.

767
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:37.000
A recruiter might promise a man a job like helicopter maintenance. But after basic training, when it was time to go to a specialized school, the military could decide that his test scores were not high enough to call, call a fight for helicopter maintenance or in some cases he could be sent to helicopter maintenance school. And if he flanked during training, he would subject to transfer to infantry.

768
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Thousands of three year projects, 100,000 volunteers ended up in infantry because of this catch, many critics denounce this fraudulent behavior.

769
01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Project 100,000 men were assigned to all major branches of the armed forces, 71% of the army, 10% of the Marine Corps, 10% of the Navy, 99% of the Air Force.

770
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.000
It brings me back to that one book. All this stuff is going on. All these people avoiding, we covered that one book called Company Commander and the guys going through Army O.C. Army Officer Cannon at school and they're like, where do you want to go?

771
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I think it was, I think that's what book it was. I think it was the book Company Commander. But you have to write down your three choices of where you want to get stationed here right there for two commander infantry commander infantry commander.

772
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:32.000
God. And all these other people just avoiding fighting. It's hard for me just straight up to understand the perspective.

773
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Like when I read this and I read that all these 68% of people avoided the draft like I read that it doesn't it's hard for me to compute that it's hard for me to compute like being a man and being like,

774
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Oh, a bunch of people are going to go fight a war. I'm going to hide over here. It's hard for me to compute that. I got to be honest with you.

775
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah, that makes sense to me that it be hard for me to understand it. What kind of human you have to be. Now, if you're like, hey, actively saying, look, I don't believe in this war. I actually get that. I actually get that. If someone says,

776
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Listen, we shouldn't be over there fighting and I'm not going. And you want to send me to jail, send me to jail. You want to you want to make me serve in some other capacity. Okay, but I'm not going to go fight that war.

777
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:29.000
If you do that, I respect you. Right. If you hide and get braces and get a letter from a psychologist.

778
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah. And that's what you do. No, I cannot believe that the numbers are that high. It's crazy. Yeah, and being in your presence for a long time and kind of reading this book with you, that makes sense.

779
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:57.000
But if you think back to, let's say a 20 year old person who isn't like you, like maybe maybe maybe they do have my maybe their middle class and they got normal stuff, quote,

780
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I'm quote, normal stuff went on. They're not really into politics or history or nothing like that. They're just into normal stuff.

781
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And then they hear on the news. Yeah. Hey, there's a war going on.

782
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And you know what, you don't have the choice. You have to fight it. It was a bad one of the military. Like that was never my plan. That was never nothing.

783
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:26.000
In fact, I don't want to just be a doctor. Well, that's a good point. And the good point, the great point that you're making is a point that I've actually making a lot lately.

784
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And I talked about it when I was on with Rogan, which is when you impose something on someone they rejected. So that's a great example.

785
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000
You impose the draft on people. They're going to get freaking pissed off. They're going to get nervous. They're going to run away from it. So that's a good point.

786
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And when I take that into account, then I understand it better. So thank you for helping me understand a little bit better when someone says, hey, you're going to war.

787
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And that's not part of your thing. You kind of think, wait a second. I'm not going to war. Where is the dentist? I need some braces over here.

788
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:06.000
But even with that being said, so I understand that's a good point. But even that being said, the fact that the numbers are that large that it was a thing to go get braces.

789
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
That it was a thing that people were right in home from college going, don't worry, mom, I got to get a letter from a psychologist.

790
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:17.000
We have to pay under $25. No, write up a report of that was a thing. It wasn't like a rare case.

791
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Yeah, but even then, again, from our perspective when it's done with and you know, when things kind of sort themselves out like that makes sense for sure, just to maybe have trouble seeing that.

792
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But again, think about how it was probably like for anything like, hey, what if your neighbor, what if hey, look, I grew up on, you know, fifth street and proud.

793
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:49.000
We're not into politics. We're into, we play baseball. And yeah, I heard about this quote unquote war. I don't know anyone in the military.

794
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I don't know anyone. Not one single person. In fact, I just heard of, you know, my neighbors cousin that lives in the other side of the country went to the military.

795
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I don't know anyone in the military. I want to be a dentist. I want to be a lawyer and you know, I want to be a fireman.

796
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:14.000
And that's the culture and then it's like, oh my gosh, you know, you hear it on the news, you get in the mail, whatever. You're, you got a register for the draft, which is this.

797
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You have to go in the military and you got to go fight this word that you don't know anything about, you don't know anything in military.

798
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And now you have to do it. Otherwise, you go to jail. So, and it's like, damn, now I got to risk my life for something I don't really know about, not necessarily that I'm against or for nothing like that. I just don't really know about it.

799
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:43.000
18 years old, I don't know what that can stuff for you now. And then your neighbor goes and say, hey, I can't go. My I got flat feet. I'm like, oh wait, do I have flat, I don't even know if I have flat feet. Let me go in the doctor or whatever.

800
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:51.000
You see what up. Oh, this guy, oh, I had braces. I don't what, oh, let me go see if I need some braces because I don't want to go either none of us want to go. We never did.

801
01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Now, and all I have to do is, you know, and then you start to just get that culture where it's not shameful to go get braces. Yeah, well, that's a big piece of it. That's those are all great points and it's your, your right and imposing things on people.

802
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And just like this, just like imposing the draft, that's why people is like, don't you think everyone should serve in the military? I was generally think, not really because when you start imposing things on people, hey, would it be good? Yes.

803
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Would it be good to do some kind of service? Would it be good to understand what it's like to be in the military or go overseas? And to, yes, that was stuff would all be great. But when you start imposing things on people, so you're right.

804
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I guess I was having a little bit of an allergic reaction to this.

805
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Is that an a little bit of a maybe a lot of an allergic reaction? Well, that's a bite, right?

806
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Uh, um, it's a curse of knowledge or something where you can't, I don't know.

807
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Yeah, and I guess it's also, I guess what makes me most frustrated is that it's like the entire chain of command, right? You got Lyndon Johnson, the president, you got the second and they're all making these moves that are based on helping people.

808
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Hey, well, we're not going to, you know, you go to college. It's all a scam.

809
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Yeah, that's what's pissing me off. I guess more than anything else is that it's a scam.

810
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And the other thing is, if you, if you are going to go to war, right? You, you should be able to explain why we're going to war.

811
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And the people should be able to say, yeah, that actually makes sense. And then you go to war and you realize that people are going to get killed and you're realizing to kill some bad people and you realize that some civilians are going to die as well.

812
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
All those things. Talk about that stuff all the time. All that stuff is going to happen.

813
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And also, if you say, hey, here's, we're going to war and you cannot explain why and the top of this goes, hey, dude, what are we doing going, and as soon as you got people going, hey, right?

814
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I'm going to go get freaking, uh, going to go piss on myself. So I don't have to go. And now you got a whole group, a whole class of people that are saying, we don't want to fight.

815
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Maybe we should reconsider what, what we're doing there. Because that's a problem.

816
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
You know, if you're in charge of a company or you're in charge of a platoon, you say, hey, we're going to go over this hill.

817
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And the whole platoon or two thirds of the platoon goes, hey, boss, not so sure about that.

818
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Or you're in a company, say, we're going to go in this new market area and a bunch of your leadership and a bunch of your mid-level managers say, hey, boss,

819
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I don't want to go into that market area. What about you? I don't want to go, what about you? I don't want to go, okay, you have to go into that market area.

820
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Maybe you should reconsider what you're doing. You're not smarter than everybody else. That's a problem.

821
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Going back to this book.

822
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Most project 100,000 men were graduated from basic training, even if the even if company commanders had to cheat to get them through, after leaving basic training, project 100,000 men were sent to AIT,

823
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:45.000
which is advanced individual training to learn impotu tactics or if they were lucky specialized skills, such as radio telephone operator RTL, perhaps.

824
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Called the moron core at Fort Polk. Project 100,000 men were, quote, pretty damn bad. Recalled one officer. Somebody had to help them to get dressed in the morning.

825
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
They couldn't understand what was going on. Another officer said lots of these guys just weren't fit to do a job.

826
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I had to help one by a toothbrush and pack his bags so he could report to another duty station.

827
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Fast forward a little bit. Most of the 504,000 men of project 100k went to Vietnam with about half of them assigned to combat units, which is just insane.

828
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
A total of 5,470 of these men died while in service. Most of them in combat.

829
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Their fatality rate was three times out of the other GIs. They'll precise figures are unavailable.

830
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:44.000
All of these tallies would be higher if we knew the number of deaths and injuries of substandard men who were not officially counted in project 100,000.

831
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:55.000
According to Colonel David Hackworth and Salute, who fought in both Korea and Vietnam wars, and became one of the most highly decorated warriors in American history.

832
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Project, quote, project 100,000 was implemented to produce more grunts for the killing fields of Vietnam.

833
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It took unfit recruits from the bottom of the barrel and rushed them to Vietnam. The result was human applesauce.

834
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:19.000
He added that for fighting in combat, quote, 10 smart and fit soldiers are better than 100 out of shape dummies and quote.

835
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And that's, you know, you're, you're the comments you were bringing up earlier.

836
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I think it's three guys are good. Eight guys. That's his ratio. He's given up 10 to 100. Is that a hyperbally a little exaggerated maybe.

837
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But if you're talking about people that can't tie their shoes, it might not be hyperbally. It might be reality.

838
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Yeah, nonetheless he's making the point that that's a big deal.

839
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Yeah.

840
01:23:45.000 --> 01:24:00.000
One of one veteran who had good reason to be dismayed by the deaths of Project 100,000 men at Vietnam was Leslie John Shellhase, who had been wounded in the Battle of Bulge in World War II and had served as a Lieutenant Colonel under McNamara at the Pentagon in the late 1960s.

841
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000
He said he played a central role in planning for Project 100,000, which he considered a bad idea from the start.

842
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:27.000
We mean, the Pentagon planners resisted Project 100,000 because we knew that wars are not won by using marginal man power as cannon fodder, but rather by risking and sometimes losing the flower of a nation's youth and quote.

843
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Can you imagine being in charge of something and you're getting all this resistance from people that actually do that for a living and you force it down there for what's anyways.

844
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
That's again to your point, Oilyer earlier, which is a reference to my point when you impose things on people it's a bad move.

845
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Lieutenant Paul D Walker who served in Vietnam, oh and by the way, you know, you've heard me say that imposing things on people doesn't work.

846
01:24:51.000 --> 01:25:03.000
It doesn't clearly because you impose the draft on people and they avoid it, they get braces, they piss on themselves, whatever. So you think, oh, well, just draft me. It doesn't work. Doesn't work to impose things on people.

847
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Lieutenant Paul D Walker who served in Vietnam as a battoon leader in the armored cavalry of the first infantry division wrote about the worst episode during his tour of duty.

848
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:25.000
We had not seen a single enemy soldier in two days of combat operations resulting in three killed ten wounded and three vehicles destroyed. He blamed the four project 100,000 men in his puttune who accounted for more than their share of casualties in accidents.

849
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:37.000
He said that some of the project 100,000 men were, quote, virtually untrainable and never should have been allowed into the military and certainly not send into combat.

850
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Fast forward a little bit. Not only were low quality and listed men sent to Vietnam said Westmoreland, but low quality officers as well. He cited Lieutenant William Cally convicted it in the murder of more than a hundred on our citizens in the battle in the in the me lie masker 1968.

851
01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:11.000
According to Arnold R. Isaacs, the Vietnam War correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, Cally quote, funked out a palm beach junior college with two seas a D and four F's in his first year and reportedly managed to get through off-strike and it's cool without even learning how to read a map or use compass and quote.

852
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Marine Corcoranel Robert D. Heinle said that the army had to take Cally quote because no one else was available.

853
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:34.000
His own attorney used Cally's low intelligence as a courtroom defense. The army he said was to blame for me lie massacre because it had lowered mental standards men if it hadn't lowered mental standards. Men like Cally never would have been commissioned.

854
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But a gay blue spent 22 years as a US Army officer says quote even the staunchest defenders of the army agree that a normal times a man of lieutenant Cally's intelligence and predispositions would never have been allowed to hold a commission.

855
01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The first year was the war when McNamara was campaigning to draft lower apps. You'd men wise military commanders and veterans were warning against this misguided idea.

856
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:19.000
For example, 1964, two years before Project Tundra K was launched and impassioned article appeared in the American Bar Association journal by Texas attorney and reserve air force captain William F. Walsh who wrote war fair is steadily growing more complex.

857
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:28.000
The day is passed when an effective soldier need only the intelligence to point a musket downhill and obey an order don't fire till this you to you see the whites of their eyes.

858
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Service in the armed forces today requires an alert questioning mind simply to master the technology of weapons and tactics. There is likely to be no room for the low IQ soldier the warm body who cannot or will not cut the mustard that man is going to get in the way of those who will have to do the job and quote.

859
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.000
This guy was hearing this despite such warnings that McNamara plow ahead and the results are disastrous.

860
01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:03.000
One of the biggest blunders of our Vietnam experience said lieutenant Colonel Charles L. Armstrong of the Marine Corps was the project.

861
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:15.000
After the current 1000 follow you've taken on board marginally qualified individuals under the mistaken watchward of if the infantry doesn't have to be real smart dumb grunt, however, is not a complete phrase.

862
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:23.56
Dumb dead grunt is. You don't have to be a full-bright scholar. You don't have to be a full-bright scholar to be a good rifleman.

863
01:28:24.76 --> 01:28:26.76
But you can't be stupid.

864
01:28:27.88 --> 01:28:32.92
To survive in combat, you had to be smart. You had to know how to use your rifle effectively and keep it clean and operable.

865
01:28:32.92 --> 01:28:39.16
How to navigate through jungles and rice paddies without alerting the enemy and how to communicate and cooperate with other members of your team.

866
01:28:39.16 --> 01:28:45.24
Sad to say, many low-apps, two men were not smart enough to be successful in combat and his result they were killed or wounded.

867
01:28:50.28 --> 01:28:54.20
Barry Roma when his nephew Robert ended up in Vietnam at the same time.

868
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:03.64
I love Robert like a brother we grew up together. He was only one month younger. Barry served an infantry as a platoon leader in 1967 to 1968.

869
01:29:03.64 --> 01:29:09.56
saw a lot of combat winning a bronze star for his courage on the battlefield. During his tour, he learned that Robert had been drafted.

870
01:29:09.88 --> 01:29:13.88
And it was being trained in Fort Lewis, Washington being an infantryman, destined for Vietnam.

871
01:29:13.88 --> 01:29:20.20
Barry was alarmed because Robert was, quote, very slow and it failed the army's mental test.

872
01:29:20.20 --> 01:29:28.76
But then a long-came project, 100k lowering standards and making him draughtable. A host of people, his relatives, his comrades at Fort Lewis, his sergeants and officers,

873
01:29:28.76 --> 01:29:35.88
wrote to the commanding general at Fort Lewis asking that Robert not be sent in a combat because, as one relative put it, quote, he would die.

874
01:29:37.72 --> 01:29:43.56
But the general turned down the request once in Vietnam. Robert was sent to an infantry unit near the border of Fort North Vietnam.

875
01:29:43.56 --> 01:29:48.36
One of the most dangerous combat areas during a patrol he was shot in the neck while trying to help a wounded friend.

876
01:29:48.36 --> 01:29:56.76
He did not die instantly, but heavy gunfire kept a medic from reaching him. He drowned in his own blood, said Barry.

877
01:29:58.68 --> 01:30:04.36
Looking back, Barry said that Robert really didn't have much luck. While others were getting draft

878
01:30:04.36 --> 01:30:11.72
a firmance, he was drafted. While congressional while congressman's sons were getting four Fs, which were exemptions,

879
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:15.64
for braces on their teeth, Robert was drafted as part of Project 100k.

880
01:30:15.64 --> 01:30:24.20
In a speech delivered 42 years later, Barry Rommel said that the family had never recovered from losing Robert,

881
01:30:24.20 --> 01:30:28.20
quote, his death almost destroyed us with anger and sorrow and quote.

882
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:39.08
Fastboard a little bit here, mental slowness and extreme anxiety were among the worst enemies of Project 100k,

883
01:30:39.08 --> 01:30:46.44
men in combat. While training at Fort Benning says Lieutenant Colonel Robert Kimball of combat veteran of Vietnam War,

884
01:30:46.44 --> 01:30:51.72
we had the ideas cemented into our heads that there were two kinds of soldiers, the quick and the dead.

885
01:30:52.84 --> 01:30:57.16
To survive in combat, you had to be quick to recognize a threat and quick to respond to it.

886
01:30:57.16 --> 01:31:01.24
All soldiers in combat experience fear and fear causes a soldier to slow down.

887
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:04.92
Fear can have a major impact on whether or not a soldier survives war.

888
01:31:04.92 --> 01:31:15.48
Sergeant Major Francis T. McNeve said that people who were borderline retarded did not respond

889
01:31:15.48 --> 01:31:23.32
fast enough and that's how people became casualties. Marine Captain David Anthony Dawson said,

890
01:31:23.32 --> 01:31:29.40
men who could not understand simple orders or perform simple tasks clearly posed to danger

891
01:31:29.40 --> 01:31:33.08
to themselves and other members of the unit. He gave the following example.

892
01:31:33.08 --> 01:31:38.28
While serving as a battalion commander Vietnam Brigadier General William Wise,

893
01:31:39.16 --> 01:31:43.48
watch the squad leader given order for an ambush patrol. The squad leader gave simple

894
01:31:43.48 --> 01:31:47.96
clear order but one Marine couldn't remember any of the crucial details including the password.

895
01:31:47.96 --> 01:31:52.12
That night this Marine left the ambush to relieve himself without telling anyone when returning

896
01:31:52.12 --> 01:32:03.96
he wanted into the kill zone. The squad leader sprang the ambush and his squad killed them.

897
01:32:08.44 --> 01:32:15.24
The Daw-Witted soldier said Pentagon official Elliott Conan Cohen does not simply get himself killed.

898
01:32:15.24 --> 01:32:21.24
He causes the deaths of others as well according to chief warn officer for William S. Tuddle of

899
01:32:21.24 --> 01:32:26.44
Vietnam veteran. If you take someone with an IQ of 40 and give them a rifle, he's more dangerous

900
01:32:26.44 --> 01:32:27.88
to you than he is to the enemy.

901
01:32:39.08 --> 01:32:43.56
There's another fast forward a little new inexperienced men in army and marine units,

902
01:32:43.56 --> 01:32:47.16
especially project-huntered Kay men had a high rate of getting themselves and their

903
01:32:47.16 --> 01:32:52.36
comrades wounded a killed in the first few months of their tours in Vietnam. James R. Ebert

904
01:32:52.36 --> 01:32:56.60
found that 43% of army fatalities happened in the first three months.

905
01:32:58.60 --> 01:33:03.88
What sucks about reading that statistic is you realize that there's training that you could do

906
01:33:03.88 --> 01:33:07.64
to get better, to get prepared and it just wasn't happening.

907
01:33:07.64 --> 01:33:19.40
John L. Ward rejoiced when project-huntered Kay came into his life. He grew up in poverty in a black

908
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:23.56
neighborhood of Glasgow, Missouri living in a shanty that had no running water.

909
01:33:24.92 --> 01:33:33.80
And he talks about John L. Ward's situation. He had taken the test to try and see if he could get

910
01:33:33.80 --> 01:33:40.04
in to the military. It wasn't good enough. His score wasn't high enough. Then he says,

911
01:33:40.04 --> 01:33:43.40
then to my other surprise, the Marine Corps recruiter showed up and explained to me that I could

912
01:33:43.40 --> 01:33:48.20
join them now, despite the low test score. Thanks to project-huntered Kay and the newly

913
01:33:48.20 --> 01:33:52.76
lowered standards, I could now pursue my dream of getting out of Glasgow and seeing the world.

914
01:33:54.76 --> 01:33:59.16
And this is an example. It gives this guy John L. Ward as an example of a guy that

915
01:33:59.16 --> 01:34:04.28
couldn't pass the test because he was uneducated, but not because he wasn't smart. So he had what

916
01:34:04.28 --> 01:34:09.72
he calls native intelligence, meaning he hadn't gone to school. So he never learned math or whatever,

917
01:34:09.72 --> 01:34:15.80
but he, but he actually was a smart human. And so when he became a Marine, he did well.

918
01:34:16.92 --> 01:34:20.68
Ward became a problem-rean quickly. One of promotion of corporal. Unfortunately, his dreams were

919
01:34:20.68 --> 01:34:25.64
shattered in Vietnam during the night of August 18, 1968, enemy troops attacked an overran

920
01:34:25.64 --> 01:34:32.28
Marine bunker at full lock killing 17 Marines and wounding many more. Ward suffered severe injuries

921
01:34:32.28 --> 01:34:35.08
and he was returned to the United States for a long and painful recovery.

922
01:34:35.80 --> 01:34:40.60
After leaving the service with rank-a-sargent, Ward spent 15 years just trying to survive his

923
01:34:40.60 --> 01:34:45.48
physical and mental torments. Eventually, he became a counselor and advocate for project-huntered Kay

924
01:34:45.48 --> 01:34:52.12
veterans. In 2012, he wrote a book entitled Moron Core. About his experiences, one of McNamara's

925
01:34:52.12 --> 01:34:56.68
Morons, a term that he hated, but nevertheless embraced a reminder, America that project,

926
01:34:56.68 --> 01:35:04.28
100 Kay was insensitive, morally unjust, and inhumane. He stated that men who were accepted

927
01:35:04.28 --> 01:35:09.000
under McNamara's program served their country honorably, even with our so-called limited

928
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.20
abilities we were willing to lay down our lives for our country. But the program was carried out

929
01:35:14.20 --> 01:35:19.64
in a morally shameful manner. Project, 100 Kay men were overrepresented in combat and they

930
01:35:19.64 --> 01:35:24.60
died in disproportionate numbers. Those who managed to survive were, quote, thrown back into

931
01:35:24.60 --> 01:35:30.92
society without skills promised us. Many of the men were homeless and suffered isolation on

932
01:35:30.92 --> 01:35:35.80
employment drug addiction and medical neglect. Many failed to receive the assistance that they were

933
01:35:35.80 --> 01:35:38.68
supposed to receive from the U.S. Department of Affairs.

934
01:35:38.68 --> 01:35:51.08
Because the National Guard and Reserves were relatively safe avenues for military service,

935
01:35:51.08 --> 01:35:55.48
they were filled to capacity with middle-class and wealthy men mostly white.

936
01:35:57.24 --> 01:36:02.36
You usually had to have connections to get in. Poor and working-class men, especially

937
01:36:02.36 --> 01:36:10.92
blacks, were excluded. In 1968, the Army National Guard was only 1.26 percent black.

938
01:36:13.88 --> 01:36:20.36
In Mississippi, where blacks made up 42 percent of the population, only one black man was admitted

939
01:36:20.36 --> 01:36:24.60
to the 10,365 man Mississippi National Guard.

940
01:36:24.60 --> 01:36:34.04
So again, if you got the right connections, in this case, oh, if you're a white dude,

941
01:36:34.04 --> 01:36:36.92
you can sneak into the National Guard and avoid going to war.

942
01:36:41.80 --> 01:36:49.08
In 1972, Professor Leslie Feedler, who knew of hundreds of young people at his college,

943
01:36:49.08 --> 01:36:54.20
state University of New York at Buffalo slowly realized that he knew not a single Vietnam veteran.

944
01:36:55.08 --> 01:37:01.80
This is 1972. I had never known a single family that had lost a son in Vietnam. The reason he

945
01:37:01.80 --> 01:37:07.40
concluded was that Vietnam was the first war that, quote, has been fought for us by our servants.

946
01:37:07.40 --> 01:37:13.000
The actual fighting of the war has become more and more exclusively an occupation of the

947
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:22.84
exploited and dispossessed end quote. During the Vietnam War, Congressman William A. Stiger of

948
01:37:22.84 --> 01:37:29.96
Wisconsin said the draft as the draft survives as the last vestige of the ancient custom whereby

949
01:37:29.96 --> 01:37:35.32
the rich and powerful force the poor and weak to provide service at substance wages.

950
01:37:37.80 --> 01:37:40.68
While it was true that men had grown up in poverty,

951
01:37:40.68 --> 01:37:44.60
were disproportionately represented in combat. I don't want to leave the impression that

952
01:37:44.60 --> 01:37:51.80
only the extremely poor fought in Vietnam. In infantry units, the poor were joined by many men

953
01:37:51.80 --> 01:37:56.84
from working class families described by historian Christian G. Appies as, quote,

954
01:37:56.84 --> 01:38:02.28
the 19-year-old children of waitresses, factory workers, truck drivers, secretaries, firefighters,

955
01:38:02.28 --> 01:38:08.44
carpenters, custodians, police officers, salespeople, clerks, mechanics, miners, and farm workers,

956
01:38:08.44 --> 01:38:16.04
and, quote, men from lower economic levels, porn working class comprised 80% of the combat forces,

957
01:38:16.04 --> 01:38:20.28
while the remaining 20% came from the middle class, half of them serving his officers.

958
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:31.08
I think I have my answer next time, somebody asked me about the draft, my draft, my answer is no,

959
01:38:31.08 --> 01:38:34.28
because this is the kind of government bullshit that goes down.

960
01:38:34.28 --> 01:38:39.96
Yeah, that's another one. Another reason why I mean, remind me back to why

961
01:38:40.68 --> 01:38:43.16
someone would dodge the draft in whatever way.

962
01:38:44.76 --> 01:38:49.56
Is, yeah, the straight-up government is telling you, you've got to work for them,

963
01:38:50.36 --> 01:38:54.20
probably lose your life or what, you know, that's it in your mind. That's what you're thinking.

964
01:38:54.20 --> 01:39:00.04
Right. Work and or kill other people about, you know, for reasons that you're not

965
01:39:00.04 --> 01:39:05.88
completely sure of, and then yes, it's up to the government now. No, you, governments,

966
01:39:05.88 --> 01:39:10.68
it's like past. That's imposed, man. Yeah. People, humans don't like being happy, things imposed, no.

967
01:39:10.68 --> 01:39:14.04
Here's the thing, okay, so taxes, right? We don't like taxes being a poor person.

968
01:39:14.04 --> 01:39:17.80
No, we don't. Even though the idea of taxes makes sense, you're like, wait a second,

969
01:39:17.80 --> 01:39:21.88
the government has the function, you know, all this stuff and the government needs money to

970
01:39:21.88 --> 01:39:26.92
function and do all this stuff, so the idea of taxes, yeah. But just like the idea of, hey,

971
01:39:26.92 --> 01:39:30.92
if I pitch the draft, you like this, listen, where at war we need people,

972
01:39:31.88 --> 01:39:35.80
everyone's going to have to serve. We're going to do a lottery. That sounds fair, right?

973
01:39:35.80 --> 01:39:39.000
Because that's what it was. It was a lottery based on what day you were born.

974
01:39:39.80 --> 01:39:44.36
So hey, look, this is what we're going to do. If we're, everyone, we're going to,

975
01:39:44.36 --> 01:39:48.52
where at war we need people. We're going to do a draft. We're going to do a lottery if you get picked.

976
01:39:48.52 --> 01:39:52.76
You got to go. You'd be like, you know what, don't really like it, but it seems like the

977
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:56.76
fair thing to do, cool them down. Let's do the draft, right? Because that's kind of the pitch.

978
01:39:56.76 --> 01:40:00.84
But then you go, wait, I don't want my son to go. Well, if it's enters into college.

979
01:40:02.12 --> 01:40:06.60
And then we work around the voting thing. Without way, I'm not working around the voting thing.

980
01:40:06.60 --> 01:40:11.88
That way we please the group that's going to get the most out of this scenario.

981
01:40:13.96 --> 01:40:20.28
What would be your, okay, let's say, hypothetical. You need a draft scenario. Like,

982
01:40:20.28 --> 01:40:24.36
basically, the draft was a solution to this issue, right?

983
01:40:24.36 --> 01:40:27.88
I'm probably need people, whatever. What would be your off the top of your head?

984
01:40:27.88 --> 01:40:32.44
Wait, it go up to me now. Well, first of all, I'm thinking that if I'm doing something,

985
01:40:32.44 --> 01:40:37.72
where the only way I can get the people to come and fight is to force them.

986
01:40:37.72 --> 01:40:42.20
There's something I'm doing something wrong. I could be that I'm explaining to everyone wrong.

987
01:40:42.20 --> 01:40:47.80
Why this is important. Yeah. Which it's hard to explain to someone in 1968 that, hey,

988
01:40:47.80 --> 01:40:55.40
this is a threat to us. And why is that? Well, because it's far away. Yeah. And so if you can't explain that,

989
01:40:55.40 --> 01:41:00.92
maybe you need to rethink what your strategy is. People get people, the ego's getting away.

990
01:41:00.92 --> 01:41:05.88
They get addicted to their plan. They believe their own bullshit. You get a guy like McNamara.

991
01:41:05.88 --> 01:41:11.96
And all the people that surround her dim, it was ridiculous. And Johnson, same thing.

992
01:41:11.96 --> 01:41:18.12
Like these guys have Johnson knew that we weren't going to win Vietnam halfway through.

993
01:41:19.72 --> 01:41:23.08
And continue to send troops there and continue to have Americans get killed.

994
01:41:23.80 --> 01:41:27.96
So you would have started just, you know, I mean, that makes sense. You'd say that.

995
01:41:27.96 --> 01:41:32.92
Start with yourself first. Like, if you're in charge of the word, like, start with the beginning first. Like,

996
01:41:32.92 --> 01:41:39.80
is this a, is this solution a real solution or is it adding to another problem?

997
01:41:39.80 --> 01:41:47.16
If I can't articulate to my team, why we, why we need to do something? And then I need to either

998
01:41:47.64 --> 01:41:51.40
develop my articulation more, come up with those reasons, make them clear to everyone,

999
01:41:51.40 --> 01:41:55.80
sir, if I'm going to go, yeah, you know what, this is a rough, rough solution. But it's the only

1000
01:41:55.80 --> 01:42:01.40
solution we get it. We're on board. Yeah. That's why you hear me, sir. I don't, the amount of times

1001
01:42:01.40 --> 01:42:05.32
that I ordered my troops to do something is zero. They're on the time, is there, all right,

1002
01:42:05.32 --> 01:42:08.84
listen, enough debate. This is what we're doing shut up. I never had to do that.

1003
01:42:08.84 --> 01:42:12.76
Because if you can say, hey, listen, here's what, here's the goal that we got to get accomplished.

1004
01:42:12.76 --> 01:42:16.76
Here's why we're doing it. I'm open to suggestions. If you can think of a better way,

1005
01:42:17.48 --> 01:42:20.76
if we, you can't think of a better way, what do you think of this idea? And everyone's, yeah,

1006
01:42:20.76 --> 01:42:23.72
it sounds pretty good. And there's people that freak out and get all scared. Like,

1007
01:42:25.16 --> 01:42:29.96
sometimes you've got to just say, shut up and do it. You actually don't have to do that. You actually

1008
01:42:29.96 --> 01:42:33.64
don't have to do that. Now, could we be in a situation and a gunfight where I'm like,

1009
01:42:33.64 --> 01:42:36.76
echo, go take that building over there? Yeah, that could happen. And you'll be like,

1010
01:42:36.76 --> 01:42:39.88
cool, got it. Boss, or you'll be like, hold on, I can't take that building. There's enemy in it.

1011
01:42:39.88 --> 01:42:44.84
I'll take this other one. I go cool. But you understand what we're trying to do. So the idea of

1012
01:42:44.84 --> 01:42:52.36
imposing things on people is wrong. It's wrong to impose things on people. When was the era of

1013
01:42:52.36 --> 01:42:59.80
like the propaganda posters? And all that was always even easy to get no more. Yeah, we make propaganda

1014
01:42:59.80 --> 01:43:04.52
posters. Well, okay. So, but you know how like there was like a very distinct era.

1015
01:43:04.52 --> 01:43:09.16
World War II is a long-term talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So to me, and I don't know,

1016
01:43:09.16 --> 01:43:16.04
what do I know? Pretty much nothing. But that being said, that seems like I see what they were doing

1017
01:43:16.04 --> 01:43:19.32
there. I see what they're doing there. It's essentially a marketing campaign. Which is one of the

1018
01:43:19.32 --> 01:43:24.12
times. What do you do essentially? That is a marketing campaign. Sometimes you go past marketing into

1019
01:43:24.12 --> 01:43:28.60
property. Okay. Kind of thing. And that's what I mean. Of course, but you're right either way.

1020
01:43:28.60 --> 01:43:35.88
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, it feels like and it's kind of a different way of

1021
01:43:35.88 --> 01:43:40.68
maybe. Yeah. Look, it's a different way of saying what you said where if you can't convince them

1022
01:43:41.40 --> 01:43:46.60
that of a good reason to do this and you're, you're not. It's like something's up, right? Yeah.

1023
01:43:46.60 --> 01:43:51.48
And here's the deal. Like when you're in World War II and you're fighting the Nazis and the

1024
01:43:51.48 --> 01:43:57.96
Imperial Japanese. It ain't a hard sell. Yeah. Oh. These people are trying to take over the whole world

1025
01:43:57.96 --> 01:44:02.92
then impose darkness on it. And we got to go scrap. Yeah. That's what's about to happen. Yeah.

1026
01:44:02.92 --> 01:44:06.92
So that's not a hard sell. That's what makes, that's why you have freaking lines or it's after

1027
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:11.72
after September 11th. Yeah. The lines around the recruiting Tim Kennedy. Remember Tim Kennedy's like,

1028
01:44:11.72 --> 01:44:17.56
yeah, I went down to, to join after Smebbo. If there's a liner, that's because it's real EV

1029
01:44:17.56 --> 01:44:21.40
is easy to see why we're doing this. What, what happened if you're not in the beginning of

1030
01:44:21.40 --> 01:44:24.12
the nonsense. Okay. We're going to go fight these people. Then after a while we're going,

1031
01:44:24.12 --> 01:44:28.20
wait, what are they doing? Wait, why have we gone through because the South Vietnamese shuffle

1032
01:44:28.20 --> 01:44:34.20
through three, four, five governments? We're, we're, we're going to help this government. Oh,

1033
01:44:34.20 --> 01:44:37.48
well now it's a new government. Now it's another government. Oh, now they're corrupt. This guy

1034
01:44:37.48 --> 01:44:42.28
got a sass net. It's freaking crazy. He's starting looking over the way. What are we doing? So

1035
01:44:42.28 --> 01:44:47.96
as that stuff starts to build up. Okay. And that's what pisses me off going back to this whole

1036
01:44:47.96 --> 01:44:52.92
draft thing. What pisses me off is this. You hear me say this? If someone on the team

1037
01:44:52.92 --> 01:44:55.96
doesn't like what we're doing, you need to raise your hand into hey boss. We don't like what's

1038
01:44:55.96 --> 01:45:02.28
going on here. So if you're getting drafted and you don't like it, what the proper thing to do is

1039
01:45:02.28 --> 01:45:06.76
for the country is to stand up and say, hey, listen, hey, listen, I am not going to go do this.

1040
01:45:07.32 --> 01:45:10.36
Because I don't think this is right because I see we went through four, five different

1041
01:45:10.36 --> 01:45:14.44
governments in Vietnam. It seems like it's corrupt. We don't know what's happening. We're getting

1042
01:45:14.44 --> 01:45:20.12
guys killed. We're killing civilians. We need to figure this out better before I sign up. And if

1043
01:45:20.12 --> 01:45:26.12
68% of the draftable populist would have said, hey, I'm not going to go fight not because I

1044
01:45:26.12 --> 01:45:29.64
have braces, not because I pissed on myself, not because I'm in college, but because I don't think

1045
01:45:29.64 --> 01:45:33.40
it's the right thing to do. Maybe someone says, okay, we got to figure out. We got to reassess what's

1046
01:45:33.40 --> 01:45:39.56
happening. Right. So in a way, let's go back to the marketing campaign. Hmm, expression.

1047
01:45:40.44 --> 01:45:46.76
So let me ask you this with a great marketing campaign, can you sell me an ice cream cone full of shit?

1048
01:45:46.76 --> 01:45:59.88
I'm not going to buy it. Yes, sir. So what you need to do is say, wait, my product is wrong. I need to

1049
01:45:59.88 --> 01:46:05.32
put milk and sugar and chocolate in here. Yeah. You need to make an adjustment. Not an adjustment or

1050
01:46:05.32 --> 01:46:11.96
what you're not adjustment on your message on your product. Yeah. Or which I think what the

1051
01:46:11.96 --> 01:46:17.24
propging endoposter's kind of seems like this was there. Their little approach was, um,

1052
01:46:18.28 --> 01:46:23.96
well, some of the ones I see anyway, it's less about the ice cream cone full of shit. It's more about

1053
01:46:24.60 --> 01:46:30.92
what kind of person has the strength to endure and ice cream cone full of shit? It's kind of like

1054
01:46:30.92 --> 01:46:37.16
that. You know, it's like messaging there for sure. Yeah, so okay. But let me ask you this in a straight-up

1055
01:46:37.16 --> 01:46:44.20
direct question. Yes. What would be my chances of convincing you to eat an ice cream cone full of shit

1056
01:46:45.08 --> 01:46:50.92
by saying you're due to your tough. You can eat this. There's very few people that are down for that.

1057
01:46:50.92 --> 01:46:55.000
Yeah. Now if I say, listen, hey, listen, this thing, this ice cream cone, it's got seaweed

1058
01:46:55.88 --> 01:47:01.48
and it's got freaking clay. No, Clay's not edible. It's got seaweed in it. This is seaweed ice

1059
01:47:01.48 --> 01:47:07.000
it doesn't taste good, but you gotta get some of this if you're bad. There's a chance I can

1060
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:14.28
convince you. We do stupid men, you don't shit all the time. Yes, sir. Because we just want to prove

1061
01:47:14.28 --> 01:47:17.88
that we're cool. We're going to prove that we're tough. So there's a difference between trying to get

1062
01:47:17.88 --> 01:47:24.44
someone to eat ice seaweed and someone trying to get someone to eat shit. So what I'm saying is

1063
01:47:24.44 --> 01:47:31.16
if I'm trying to pitch you and the only thing I've got as a product is shit is not going to work.

1064
01:47:31.16 --> 01:47:36.60
It's not a thing. What I need you to say is hey, listen, Jocco, I appreciate it. I'm not going to eat

1065
01:47:36.60 --> 01:47:42.68
shit. It's not happening. You can call me a whim. You can call me weak. You can call me pathetic,

1066
01:47:42.68 --> 01:47:48.52
but I'm not going to eat shit. Now with the seaweed, you could be like, well, I don't know. I want to be weak.

1067
01:47:48.52 --> 01:47:53.88
I don't really want to be pathetic. So, hand me the comb. We're going to get it on. So there's a,

1068
01:47:53.88 --> 01:48:02.20
there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a, it's close, but it's not the same thing. Yeah,

1069
01:48:02.20 --> 01:48:07.80
and essentially it's like you look at the, the after September 11th as an easy sell. Right.

1070
01:48:07.80 --> 01:48:11.88
Easy sell ice cream. This is spectrum ice cream. Confolish it. Hard sell hard sell.

1071
01:48:11.88 --> 01:48:18.04
Well, yeah. And then the seaweed world war two world war two easy sell. It's pretty easy sell.

1072
01:48:18.04 --> 01:48:23.72
Yeah. Pretty freaking easy sell. They, oh, by the way, they attack pro harbor. What's the sell now?

1073
01:48:23.72 --> 01:48:28.20
We got, we got, we got, just, you don't have to sell. Yeah. The ice cream's there. Everyone's taking it.

1074
01:48:28.20 --> 01:48:32.92
You want it. So, and this goes on the spectrum of all things wars, whatever.

1075
01:48:33.88 --> 01:48:38.60
Where, yeah, the easier the sell, the less you got to focus on these marketing campaign. True.

1076
01:48:38.60 --> 01:48:41.96
The harder the sell, the more you got to focus and be more clever with it. Yeah.

1077
01:48:41.96 --> 01:48:47.64
Same same. But you also have to be able to say to yourself, you know what? What I'm trying to sell is shit.

1078
01:48:47.64 --> 01:48:51.64
Yeah, at the end of the day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And if you have that, then you don't say,

1079
01:48:51.64 --> 01:48:55.24
well, I'm just going to keep forcing it down people so now you know what you say? Hey, listen, I got to change my product.

1080
01:48:55.24 --> 01:48:59.000
Yeah. What I'm trying to sell is wrong. Yeah. And that's where people get stuck. That's where

1081
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.96
McNamara, that's where Johnson, that's where these people get stuck. Because they, that their egos are too big to admit that this was a dumb idea.

1082
01:49:05.96 --> 01:49:11.96
And say, listen, hey, we tried, this was a bad plan. We didn't realize how corrupt the Vietnamese government was.

1083
01:49:11.96 --> 01:49:17.08
We didn't realize how strong the Vietnam war. We didn't realize how much we were going to have to sacrifice to get in there.

1084
01:49:17.08 --> 01:49:20.44
And we're going to cut our losses when it comes home. We're going to observe to you. What happens?

1085
01:49:21.64 --> 01:49:26.04
That that's what a square away humble human being would do. Yeah.

1086
01:49:33.08 --> 01:49:38.04
Going back to the book. William Broyles who commanded a Marine Industry Poutine to be a non from

1087
01:49:38.04 --> 01:49:45.32
1969 and 1971 said it was not a privilege to be able to fight. It was instead evidence that one had failed

1088
01:49:45.32 --> 01:49:51.24
to understand how to manipulate the system. As if anyone not smart enough to get a deferment or at

1089
01:49:51.24 --> 01:49:55.64
least to get a job in the rear was too dumb to do anything but carry a rifle.

1090
01:49:58.68 --> 01:50:04.60
Wayne Johnson who served as a grunt Vietnam 1968 told me that his squad leader assigned

1091
01:50:04.60 --> 01:50:09.96
quote, one of McNamara's boys to walk point. And justified his action by saying if anyone

1092
01:50:09.96 --> 01:50:15.80
asked a guy better dummy than the rest of us. Johnson said it was unfair. I know. But none of us

1093
01:50:15.80 --> 01:50:21.08
protested. While he was with the unit, he added none of the point men were injured killed.

1094
01:50:27.48 --> 01:50:32.12
Fast forward a little bit said earlier I showed and by the way this book is I'm obviously just

1095
01:50:32.12 --> 01:50:39.32
skim in the surface here. This book is really fascinating and informative about all of this, not just

1096
01:50:39.32 --> 01:50:44.44
around project 100,000 but obviously about the draft and spills over in a leadership as well.

1097
01:50:45.96 --> 01:50:49.88
He says earlier I showed out tens of thousands of middle class and upper class men beat

1098
01:50:49.88 --> 01:50:54.04
the draft by employing such strategies is getting a family doctor right a letter testing to some

1099
01:50:54.04 --> 01:50:59.24
minor medical problem. By contrast, most of low income youths knew nothing about how they could

1100
01:50:59.24 --> 01:51:04.92
manage their draft status. In many cases they had legitimate problems that should have kept them

1101
01:51:04.92 --> 01:51:10.68
from serving such as being blind in one eye or only having one kidney. But they possess no awareness

1102
01:51:10.68 --> 01:51:15.56
or skills to argue the case. They didn't know that they could go to a draft board or induction

1103
01:51:15.56 --> 01:51:20.52
center and explain their rightful grounds for an exemption. Later if they were abused in basic

1104
01:51:20.52 --> 01:51:25.48
training or AIT they lacked the skills to complain to a member of Congress. After discharge,

1105
01:51:25.48 --> 01:51:29.72
if they were denied veterans' benefits they didn't know how to work through the bureaucracy.

1106
01:51:31.96 --> 01:51:37.24
In my research I found only one case of a project 100k man or his family using the tools

1107
01:51:37.24 --> 01:51:42.92
of protest and persuasion that middle class citizens knew how to use. In 1969 a father and organ

1108
01:51:42.92 --> 01:51:49.64
bought the army's plan to send, sorry, fought the army's plan to send his son, whom he described

1109
01:51:49.64 --> 01:51:55.24
as retarded with a mental age of a ten year old to Vietnam as an instrument. His mother said

1110
01:51:55.24 --> 01:52:03.000
he's just a little boy he'll be killed sure. The parents generated publicity in Oregon newspapers

1111
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.20
and enlisted the aid of Congress and Congressmen went to Wyatt and Senator Mark Hatfield

1112
01:52:08.20 --> 01:52:12.04
because of all the negative publicity the army canceled the youth assignment to combat in Vietnam

1113
01:52:12.04 --> 01:52:18.52
and sent him instead to Germany to perform clerical tasks. That's only one case and why

1114
01:52:18.52 --> 01:52:24.52
that's what he's pointing out is somebody that's up in the freaking poor rural area doesn't even

1115
01:52:24.52 --> 01:52:29.64
understand, oh well you can you can you can try and get out of this or someone from the geto

1116
01:52:29.64 --> 01:52:33.64
doesn't understand oh you can you can try there's a way to get out of this they haven't heard it yet.

1117
01:52:37.40 --> 01:52:43.48
Going crazy he says this during my lifetime in moments of extreme stress anxiety or panic

1118
01:52:43.48 --> 01:52:48.12
I have done things that are dumb and destructive it is humbling and instructive to remember

1119
01:52:48.12 --> 01:52:53.88
my own episodes of dysfunction when I consider the insane actions of some project hundred k men

1120
01:52:53.88 --> 01:52:57.96
who were young typically nineteen or twenty and burdened with more anxiety and vulnerability

1121
01:52:57.96 --> 01:53:03.96
than I will ever experience that's a freaking great point you think about the things that you've

1122
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:09.08
done when you're stressed out freaked out and you've done dumb things behave badly made bad

1123
01:53:09.08 --> 01:53:13.56
decisions because of that and you're a smart person imagine what these other people I don't know more

1124
01:53:13.56 --> 01:53:22.36
stress in a combat scenario. In a study of intellectually disabled men at the mental hygiene clinic

1125
01:53:22.36 --> 01:53:28.44
at the sixty-seven evacuation hospital and queen non in a six-month period two army psychiatrists

1126
01:53:28.44 --> 01:53:34.76
found that project hundred k soldiers were referred to for psychiatric help ten times as frequently

1127
01:53:34.76 --> 01:53:43.000
as other troops. Project hundred k men they said seem to have lowered stress tolerance and a relative

1128
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.44
lack of the usual mechanisms for coping with stress and a separate study for army psychiatrists

1129
01:53:48.44 --> 01:53:53.80
concluded quote individuals of lower intellectual capacity have greater difficulty and adjustment

1130
01:53:53.80 --> 01:54:01.000
than persons of average intelligence and thus more frequently become psychiatric problems or disciplinary

1131
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:09.56
offenders. And quote can you imagine that in Vietnam during the war they're studying intellectually

1132
01:54:09.56 --> 01:54:16.92
disabled men in the army in Vietnam in combat. God we're freaking disaster.

1133
01:54:23.88 --> 01:54:28.92
Jim Bracewell, a helicopter pilot who commanded an air cavalry squadron in the Maycon Delta

1134
01:54:28.92 --> 01:54:34.60
1970 tells the story of Mike Sanchez not his real name who was a product of project hundred k

1135
01:54:34.60 --> 01:54:38.52
and never should have been sent to a war zone as soon as Mike was assigned to an infantry

1136
01:54:38.52 --> 01:54:42.68
patoon in the field the young lieutenant patoon leader realized that a terrible mistake had been made.

1137
01:54:43.88 --> 01:54:48.04
He requested that Mike be moved to rareria while the request was being processed Mike a simple

1138
01:54:48.04 --> 01:54:52.60
young man who could neither read nor write remain in the infantry patoon and was asked to perform beyond

1139
01:54:52.60 --> 01:54:58.12
his mental capabilities. The patoon leader was very compassionate and tried to keep Mike under his wing

1140
01:54:58.12 --> 01:55:04.04
protecting him from ridicule from unfailing soldiers. In return Mike developed an intense loyalty to

1141
01:55:04.04 --> 01:55:09.32
the lieutenant one day as the patoon moved through some rice patties the men came under heavy fire

1142
01:55:09.32 --> 01:55:14.12
from the enemy and they ran for cover as soon as they reach cover Mike looked for his lieutenant.

1143
01:55:14.12 --> 01:55:17.48
He couldn't find him. He frantically began calling the patoon leader's name.

1144
01:55:17.48 --> 01:55:21.48
One of the other soldiers told Mike to stop yelling that he had seen the lieutenant go down and

1145
01:55:21.48 --> 01:55:25.96
thought he was dead. Mike tearfully asked where he was when he point pin pointed the

1146
01:55:25.96 --> 01:55:30.76
lieutenant's position. He shed his equipment including his rifle and ran through heavy fire to his

1147
01:55:30.76 --> 01:55:35.96
lieutenant. He scrambled to his young leader's side and discovered that he was badly hit in both legs.

1148
01:55:35.96 --> 01:55:40.20
Mike didn't know whether the lieutenant was dead or alive. He made no attempt at first aid.

1149
01:55:40.20 --> 01:55:44.68
It never occurred to him. He simply picked up the lieutenant as if he were a doll and ran back to the

1150
01:55:44.68 --> 01:55:48.36
tree line. Neither of them were hit during the dash to the trees and no one could believe

1151
01:55:48.36 --> 01:55:53.40
it considering the intensity of enemy fire. They said the patoon bullets hitting the rice patty

1152
01:55:53.40 --> 01:55:58.12
patty water all around him made it seem impossible if they were not hit. The lieutenant received

1153
01:55:58.12 --> 01:56:02.36
first aid and a short time later was evacuated by helicopter. He survived.

1154
01:56:03.48 --> 01:56:08.44
About a month later, Bracewell said Mike was sent to the rear area to participate in a parade

1155
01:56:08.44 --> 01:56:12.92
and receive a silver star for heroism presented by the commanding general of his division.

1156
01:56:13.72 --> 01:56:19.48
As was costumeria ceremonies, the general presented the metal and then chatted with him for a few

1157
01:56:19.48 --> 01:56:23.96
minutes. It was during this chat that the general realized that something was not quite right.

1158
01:56:23.96 --> 01:56:35.80
He ordered his subordinates to remove Mike from combat. That kind of rings of the forest gump scenario.

1159
01:56:37.88 --> 01:56:41.24
That section, there's some other good stories in there about

1160
01:56:42.52 --> 01:56:49.16
just about guys that did perform. Even though they were not quite, didn't have as much cognitive

1161
01:56:49.16 --> 01:56:52.36
capacity. They, and they just got a bunch of examples like that.

1162
01:56:54.60 --> 01:56:59.32
Bottom of the barrel, this section's called and calling the day in 1969, when you reported to the

1163
01:56:59.32 --> 01:57:05.16
induction center in downtown Cleveland, Ohio for his pre-induction exam. Mark Footk can said at one

1164
01:57:05.16 --> 01:57:09.16
point, at that point in the word, they were taking just about anyone they could get misfits,

1165
01:57:09.16 --> 01:57:12.68
flatfoot's the half crippled and the half crazed.

1166
01:57:14.76 --> 01:57:17.56
And so they had to get more people, they had two ways to get more people.

1167
01:57:17.56 --> 01:57:21.24
And Ducson centers had a monthly quota for how many project hundred K men they could take.

1168
01:57:22.04 --> 01:57:25.40
When they used up their quota, they were instructed to continue to take low scoring men,

1169
01:57:25.40 --> 01:57:31.80
but not count them a part of project hundred K. In this way, thousands of additional low IQ

1170
01:57:31.80 --> 01:57:36.84
men were brought into the ranks. Two recruiters and induction centers were pressured to cast a

1171
01:57:36.84 --> 01:57:41.40
wider net and bring in thousands of additional men who would normally fail to qualify for

1172
01:57:41.40 --> 01:57:45.24
military duty men with health problems, physical defects, psychological disorders,

1173
01:57:45.24 --> 01:57:51.16
criminal backgrounds, or drug and alcohol addiction. These second-class fellows to use President

1174
01:57:51.16 --> 01:57:56.12
Johnson's term, served at political goal, they spared healthier wealth for your men in the middle

1175
01:57:56.12 --> 01:58:03.96
class from being drafted. Many military commanders lamented the skewed priorities that put the

1176
01:58:03.96 --> 01:58:09.16
playing a put-playing politics ahead of creating a high quality fighting force.

1177
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:15.40
Adrian Arluis, a retired U.S. Army major who taught at West Point said,

1178
01:58:15.40 --> 01:58:20.28
the primary concern of the draft was pacification of the American people to disrupt the

1179
01:58:20.28 --> 01:58:25.48
American society as little as possible, providing the armed forces with the best men possible

1180
01:58:25.48 --> 01:58:30.44
was at best a secondary consideration. It's just about politics, man.

1181
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:36.60
As the military grew more and more desperate for manpower, induction centers grabbed

1182
01:58:36.60 --> 01:58:40.28
every warm body they could find even men with serious medical conditions such as asthma,

1183
01:58:40.28 --> 01:58:47.000
high blood pressure, hearing loss, Carlos Martinez who said he grew up in the streets and orphaned

1184
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.96
edges of Bronx and Brooklyn was rejected by the military 1964 as physically unfit for service,

1185
01:58:51.96 --> 01:58:57.16
but in 1967 low and behold he was now fit. We were the bottom of the barely said, I was almost

1186
01:58:57.16 --> 01:59:02.52
legally blind. But when we got down to the induction station in 1967 it wasn't really about the

1187
01:59:02.52 --> 01:59:09.96
physicals. It was like you were being taken. The assumption was that the assumption was already made

1188
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:14.60
that you were available, everybody was taken the only way you don't pass is if you don't have a leg.

1189
01:59:17.64 --> 01:59:22.60
Fast forward a little bit more among the ranks of the armed forces in 1961 or

1190
01:59:23.48 --> 01:59:28.52
men who had been unacceptable because of their body size. For example, two heavy two thin, two short.

1191
01:59:28.52 --> 01:59:38.52
Until Project 100K, only made them fair again. 9% of Project 100K men were accepted because

1192
01:59:38.52 --> 01:59:46.84
a new less-strigen physical centers. So 91% was mental. But there was 9% that did lower the physical

1193
01:59:46.84 --> 01:59:54.28
standards because they were different in quotes. These men were often harassed and given humiliating

1194
01:59:54.28 --> 01:59:59.08
names overweight men were ridiculed with names such as Fatty, Lardas and Porkey,

1195
01:59:59.08 --> 02:00:03.96
excessively thin men, skin and bones and tiny men run and midget.

1196
02:00:07.40 --> 02:00:12.52
Army veteran John Kettwig tells of a trainee called Fatso at Fort Dix, New Jersey,

1197
02:00:12.52 --> 02:00:17.24
you committed suicide after suffering horrendous cruelty at the hands of a sadistic sergeant.

1198
02:00:17.24 --> 02:00:23.08
Once he had been a law student, said Kettwig, he had been called to do his duty yet of wife.

1199
02:00:30.52 --> 02:00:35.16
And criminals as well. For many NCOs and officers, the Pentagon policy that caused most

1200
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:40.12
anger and outrage in the later years of the war was the relaxation of what's so called moral standards.

1201
02:00:40.12 --> 02:00:44.44
Men who had been convicted of serious crimes like armed robbery were supposed to be disqualified

1202
02:00:44.44 --> 02:00:49.72
from service, but recruiters and induction centers were given the authority to grant moral wavers

1203
02:00:49.72 --> 02:00:54.12
to bring them into the ranks. In a common scenario, a judge working in collaboration with a

1204
02:00:54.12 --> 02:00:59.16
recruiter would give a young offender a choice, go to jail or join the Army or the Marine Corps.

1205
02:01:01.56 --> 02:01:06.04
When a judge and recruiter worked out a deal, the procedure was known as punitive enlistment.

1206
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.32
Criminal behavior was often accompanied by alcohol and drug abuse if a man had a police record

1207
02:01:13.32 --> 02:01:17.72
for drug driving or intoxicated assaults. He would have been rejected in the days before the

1208
02:01:17.72 --> 02:01:23.32
Vietnam war, but after the war became began, because of the manpower shortages he was accepted.

1209
02:01:23.96 --> 02:01:29.88
That punitive enlistment. How much do you know about it? Like, do they do that now?

1210
02:01:29.88 --> 02:01:36.84
I heard of that. They don't do it anymore. I would hear guys saying that even when I got in

1211
02:01:36.84 --> 02:01:42.84
or jail or the man there. I know a guy. Okay, I'll stay up the judge. That's what he told them.

1212
02:01:42.84 --> 02:01:48.84
Okay, that's then still happens. How long ago was that? It's hard to get in the military right now.

1213
02:01:49.40 --> 02:01:55.32
Yeah, it was before. I don't know. I don't know. But he is younger than me.

1214
02:01:56.52 --> 02:02:01.72
So I know. I guess it's a thing. I definitely knew people that told stories like that,

1215
02:02:01.72 --> 02:02:04.28
but there's a lot of people especially when you first get in the military. A lot of stories.

1216
02:02:04.28 --> 02:02:09.24
No, for everyone was a, you know, drafted to play in the NFL, but then they chose this.

1217
02:02:09.24 --> 02:02:16.44
You know, everyone's a D1 football player or Golden Gloves boxer and like there's a lot of stories here.

1218
02:02:16.44 --> 02:02:23.000
Or you know, I was like, like, fuck, you know, I was either, I come to jail or come here.

1219
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.36
So you hear a lot of stories, you know, in which ones to believe kind of when you first get in.

1220
02:02:26.36 --> 02:02:33.88
Yeah, I believe this guy, I guess. I mean, yeah, I believe him, but yeah, I don't who knows.

1221
02:02:33.88 --> 02:02:36.84
I don't know. I don't know if I didn't grow up with him or nothing. If you know the guy,

1222
02:02:36.84 --> 02:02:42.44
yeah, and like he seems legit, then maybe it's true. Yeah. But I'm just saying when you get in the military,

1223
02:02:42.44 --> 02:02:47.48
especially Boocamp, there's a lot of people say a lot of weird stories, man.

1224
02:02:48.04 --> 02:02:53.48
They make up a lot of stuff that's trying sound cool. But we know that it did happen.

1225
02:02:53.48 --> 02:02:56.60
I mean, clearly, that had a name. I was that's the first time I'd ever heard that name,

1226
02:02:56.60 --> 02:03:00.36
punitive enlistment. I've never heard that before. Or maybe now it's like less like official,

1227
02:03:00.36 --> 02:03:02.52
you know, or something like that. Yeah.

1228
02:03:02.52 --> 02:03:08.20
Yeah, maybe it's less official now. I know it's harder to get in the military now. Like if you have

1229
02:03:08.20 --> 02:03:14.84
criminal records, it's really hard to get in the military now. So check.

1230
02:03:16.28 --> 02:03:20.36
And finally, years of the war, men who were violent, angry or disturbed became a significant presence

1231
02:03:20.36 --> 02:03:24.20
in the Army and Marine Corps according to many officers. They were responsible for a series

1232
02:03:24.20 --> 02:03:30.76
breakdown of discipline in the troops at Vietnam in 1971. Colonel Robert DeHinal wrote in

1233
02:03:30.76 --> 02:03:36.52
Armed Forces Journal. This is in 1971. We wrote this. Our Army now that now remains in Vietnam

1234
02:03:36.52 --> 02:03:42.04
is in a state approaching collapse with individual units avoiding or having refused combat,

1235
02:03:42.04 --> 02:03:47.08
murdering their officers, drug ridden, and disperated were not near muteness.

1236
02:03:48.12 --> 02:03:54.28
That's an assessment in the Armed Forces Journal in 1971, from a Colonel, a full-board Colonel.

1237
02:03:54.28 --> 02:04:02.44
According to Baskar and Strauss, the most serious symptom of the crisis in discipline of Vietnam

1238
02:04:02.44 --> 02:04:06.84
was fragging. Real or threatened assaults on officers and high-ranking sergeants.

1239
02:04:06.84 --> 02:04:11.48
The practice got its name from fragmentation grenade, which would be rolled into the area where

1240
02:04:11.48 --> 02:04:16.20
an officer or NCO was sleeping when it exploded. No fingerprints could be found.

1241
02:04:17.40 --> 02:04:21.96
The target was often a leader who was hated because he was incompetent and leading men or

1242
02:04:21.96 --> 02:04:27.24
excessively harsh and is disciplined or overly aggressive in waging war. Putting the lives of

1243
02:04:27.24 --> 02:04:33.40
soldiers and Marines in an unnecessary risk just so that he could gain glory and advance his own career.

1244
02:04:34.36 --> 02:04:38.68
In addition to thousands of threats that were never carried out, there were confirmed reports

1245
02:04:38.68 --> 02:04:44.44
of at least 800 fragings, or attempted fragings in the Army in the Marine Corps. That's a lot,

1246
02:04:44.44 --> 02:04:50.60
800. With 86 men killed and an estimated 700 wounded. From fragging?

1247
02:04:50.60 --> 02:04:54.84
Yep. Like children's arrow confirmed. Yep. That's confirmed reports.

1248
02:04:56.68 --> 02:05:01.88
That's some turmoil right there. But this was probably only the tip of the iceberg,

1249
02:05:01.88 --> 02:05:07.32
according to a historian, a West Heiter. The true figure may never be known.

1250
02:05:09.88 --> 02:05:14.60
Many officers felt unsafe simply because they were authority figures. During his second-torn Vietnam,

1251
02:05:15.56 --> 02:05:20.36
major Colin Powell later, forced our general said he was living in a large tent and I moved my

1252
02:05:20.36 --> 02:05:24.28
cot every night, partly to fort via Colin and four months who might be tracking me.

1253
02:05:24.28 --> 02:05:29.16
But also because I did not rule out attacks on our authority from within the battalion itself.

1254
02:05:31.08 --> 02:05:43.48
Coming from Colin Powell. Captain Thomas Cecil, who was stationed at Comron Bay in 1971,

1255
02:05:43.48 --> 02:05:47.48
was so worried about attacks on his life that during his last month in Vietnam he slept in the

1256
02:05:47.48 --> 02:05:51.96
military intelligence bunker and only his battalion commander knew where he was at night.

1257
02:05:54.28 --> 02:05:59.32
Among Marines in 1968, fragging was a worse problem than an illegal drug use,

1258
02:05:59.32 --> 02:06:03.56
according to a team of Marine Corps historians who wrote that although the number of

1259
02:06:03.56 --> 02:06:09.08
fragging's was relatively small, the knowledge that fragging's occurred often had a chilling effect

1260
02:06:09.08 --> 02:06:16.28
on a leader's willingness to enforce discipline. And again, when you're, when you're

1261
02:06:16.28 --> 02:06:21.32
attitude is you're going to impose things on people and you're going to enforce discipline instead of

1262
02:06:21.32 --> 02:06:28.20
lead and listen and corroborate to figure out how to execute things.

1263
02:06:33.48 --> 02:06:36.44
I don't know something. Oh, you got to get him to do it. Well, you got to listen to him.

1264
02:06:38.44 --> 02:06:41.08
And I've actually done that. I did that my whole career.

1265
02:06:41.08 --> 02:06:47.24
Most fragging's occurred inside camps while out in jungles and rice pad.

1266
02:06:47.24 --> 02:06:51.08
Paddy's a different method was used by infantrymen who wanted to kill, quote,

1267
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:55.72
bat officers according to Robert Nylin, the combat infantry officer quoted earlier.

1268
02:06:56.44 --> 02:07:01.000
Sometimes an airant bullet struck an incompetent fool amid a firefight problem solved.

1269
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:12.20
During the war army private, an army private named Paul Solo was quoted as saying the army

1270
02:07:12.20 --> 02:07:17.56
keeps a lot of strange dudes off the street. The most common example of strange dudes were known

1271
02:07:17.56 --> 02:07:22.68
in the military as misfits, chronically maladapted soldiers who were unable to fit in with other

1272
02:07:22.68 --> 02:07:28.60
soldiers because they were disturbingly different from everyone else. Misfits wrote author Peter Barnes,

1273
02:07:28.60 --> 02:07:33.000
tend to share a number of common characteristics. Large majority of our high school dropouts

1274
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.24
were often slow-witted loner types who are not particularly attractive or likable.

1275
02:07:37.24 --> 02:07:42.28
And civilian life, most of them have been losers many times over. In the military, this pattern is

1276
02:07:42.28 --> 02:07:49.56
repeated. If misfits manage to slip through pre-induction screening and the anorbasic training,

1277
02:07:49.56 --> 02:07:54.52
their ability to adapt becomes noticeable and they are usually discharged sometimes with a

1278
02:07:54.52 --> 02:07:59.000
diagnosis of personality disorder. But during the Vietnam war, misfits were kept because of

1279
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.68
manpower shortages. Most of them were poor learners or slow adjusters. They were unable to make friends

1280
02:08:04.68 --> 02:08:08.52
and they became targets of their superior's rage and their peers resentment.

1281
02:08:09.64 --> 02:08:14.52
Malcolm Miller Jones, a veteran who grew up in New York City noted that group cohesion was

1282
02:08:14.52 --> 02:08:19.32
important for petoons in training and in combat at a man who failed to work in sync with his comrades

1283
02:08:19.32 --> 02:08:24.12
and failed to do his share of the chair at chores was often the recipient of a blanket party

1284
02:08:24.12 --> 02:08:28.84
in which a blanket was thrown over the man and just put two meets mates beat him anonymously

1285
02:08:28.84 --> 02:08:33.40
with their fist. A blanket party would cause some men to shape out and become cooperative,

1286
02:08:33.40 --> 02:08:42.68
but it failed to reform others. I mentioned some of the success stories. Here's another success story.

1287
02:08:42.68 --> 02:08:48.84
There's a chief hospital, Corman Don Phelps, who was in charge of a sick bay, a big sick bay,

1288
02:08:48.84 --> 02:08:55.08
and he had an assistant that he calls Elmer here, not as real name, who was not too bright,

1289
02:08:55.08 --> 02:09:01.16
quote, not too bright. Phelps was ordered to take Elmer and he was immediately surprised by the young

1290
02:09:01.16 --> 02:09:05.88
man's solid performance and eagerness to plead it. Please, Elmer made the sick bay sparkle with

1291
02:09:05.88 --> 02:09:09.40
cleanliness. Phelps said I couldn't amass for a cleaner sharper space if I had a crew of five

1292
02:09:09.40 --> 02:09:14.20
work informed me because of Elmer's mental limitations. Phelps said he never gave many large amount of

1293
02:09:14.20 --> 02:09:19.56
detailed work, but in the basic cleaning jobs that he assigned Elmer took extreme pride when he

1294
02:09:19.56 --> 02:09:24.44
did accomplish, he was very polite and developed the highly commendable appearance. The story of

1295
02:09:24.44 --> 02:09:28.52
Elmer supports the argument made by many educators and psychologists that low-app through

1296
02:09:28.52 --> 02:09:35.16
the individuals can be productive in low-stress non-dater situations. It gives another example of a

1297
02:09:35.16 --> 02:09:41.08
of a lieutenant that has to type letters of condolences home and he says, my best type is was a young

1298
02:09:41.08 --> 02:09:45.48
man who seemingly never should have been drafted or recruited. His mental acuity was severely disabled.

1299
02:09:45.48 --> 02:09:50.68
However, he was diligent in his duties never distracted and rarely made in error. I wish I had more

1300
02:09:50.68 --> 02:10:02.20
like him. A wall, absent without lead, the major illegality in the armed forces during the

1301
02:10:02.20 --> 02:10:07.88
Vietnam War was absenteeism, A wall, which is absence of less than 30 days in desertion,

1302
02:10:07.88 --> 02:10:13.16
30 days are longer. During the entire period of the Vietnam War, says baschering strouse,

1303
02:10:13.16 --> 02:10:18.68
there were approximately 1.5 million A wall incidents and 500,000 desertion incidents.

1304
02:10:19.96 --> 02:10:24.68
At the peak of the war, a 1968 American soldier was going a wall every two minutes,

1305
02:10:24.68 --> 02:10:31.24
and deserting every six minutes. In 1970 alone, wrote Marine Colonel Robert Dehyneal Jr.

1306
02:10:31.24 --> 02:10:37.56
The Army had 65,000 deserters, a roughly the equivalent of four infantry divisions.

1307
02:10:43.40 --> 02:10:47.000
Project 100K men were more likely to run away than other soldiers.

1308
02:10:47.64 --> 02:10:51.80
So A wall is less than 30 days. And then that's desertion after that.

1309
02:10:51.80 --> 02:10:54.20
Yep. And A was absent without lead.

1310
02:10:54.20 --> 02:11:03.72
Yeah, because the lead was how you go. Often their behavior stem from their personality and

1311
02:11:03.72 --> 02:11:08.12
family history, these are 100K people that go that run away. Many of the men grew up in poor families,

1312
02:11:08.12 --> 02:11:13.96
no father present, little or no education, lots of chaos and confusion. For some low IQ men,

1313
02:11:13.96 --> 02:11:18.12
running away was a common response to stress and harassment. They failed to stop and ponder

1314
02:11:18.12 --> 02:11:22.28
the many warnings they had heard throughout their time in the military. Warnings of the dire

1315
02:11:22.28 --> 02:11:26.36
consequences of going a wall or deserting. They were told that a wall or desersion would

1316
02:11:26.36 --> 02:11:30.52
cause them to receive a less than honorable discharge, which would make it difficult to get a good

1317
02:11:30.52 --> 02:11:36.04
job. Unfortunately, the concept of a lifelong stigma was too abstract to have any real meaning for them.

1318
02:11:38.76 --> 02:11:42.36
The guy who had troubles usually had less intelligence than didn't think ahead. Most of these

1319
02:11:42.36 --> 02:11:47.40
kids weren't bad. They were just dumb. It's coming from a, it's coming from a batayan commander.

1320
02:11:47.40 --> 02:11:57.56
There's a little uprising in the, in the, in the Percidio, Percidio in San Francisco. They had

1321
02:11:57.56 --> 02:12:04.92
like a prison there. October 11, 1968, a prisoner named Richard Rusty Bunch, who's described

1322
02:12:04.92 --> 02:12:10.20
by relatives as high IQ, but severely depressed and suicidal, asked a guard. If I run, will you shoot

1323
02:12:10.20 --> 02:12:16.52
me? You requested that the guard aim at his head and then he skipped away. He'd gone 30 feet when

1324
02:12:16.52 --> 02:12:23.32
the guard killed him with a 12 gauge shotgun blast and his back. The killing sparked a peaceful

1325
02:12:23.32 --> 02:12:28.44
sit down protest by 27 of the prisoners. Their spokesman tried to read a list of their grievances,

1326
02:12:28.44 --> 02:12:34.68
but the prison commander 25 year old captain called in 75 MPs to encircled the huddled men together

1327
02:12:34.68 --> 02:12:40.04
and ordered a halt to the process protest. When the men refused all 27 were seized and charged with

1328
02:12:40.04 --> 02:12:48.36
muting, the charges later reduced to will for obedience, disobedience of lawful order. In the following

1329
02:12:48.36 --> 02:12:52.52
months, three men escaped to Canada, two were found guilty of lesser charges, 22 were found guilty

1330
02:12:52.52 --> 02:12:58.52
with sentences ranging from six months to 16 years, but ultimately none of them actually had to serve

1331
02:12:58.52 --> 02:13:04.52
service. Serve more than one year. Thanks the unfavorable publicity the army received. That's,

1332
02:13:04.52 --> 02:13:09.40
you can, influence what's going on. That's why I said, when you stand up and say, hey, this doesn't

1333
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:15.80
make sense here, this is what no one agrees with this. You can actually gain support. Yeah, and again,

1334
02:13:15.80 --> 02:13:20.84
it kind of goes back, you know, in a small way, maybe in a big way to the, that like marketing campaign

1335
02:13:20.84 --> 02:13:27.56
idea. For sure. Where it's a help review. Yeah, yeah, all that's all in play, right? So yeah,

1336
02:13:27.56 --> 02:13:32.84
the government or if you need people to fight your war, you've been have a good marketing campaign

1337
02:13:32.84 --> 02:13:36.28
and it's either going to be a easier seller or a hard to sell, whatever that's in. Hey,

1338
02:13:36.28 --> 02:13:41.000
that's on you. Yeah. And you have a sell it decisions for me. Yeah, yeah, fully. And if you have to,

1339
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.60
if it's hard to sell things, you need to think about what you're doing. Well, it shouldn't be hard to sell

1340
02:13:44.60 --> 02:13:50.92
things, bro. Yeah. Yeah. What does people on my team not want to win? Yeah. And if they don't want to win,

1341
02:13:50.92 --> 02:13:55.72
they're not aligned to we have a real problem. But most of the time we want to win. Yeah. And then yeah,

1342
02:13:55.72 --> 02:14:01.08
and the shoes kind of other foot as well, if it's like, hey, government is not selling me, they're trying

1343
02:14:01.08 --> 02:14:06.52
to impose. So hey, let me market to why, you know, why we shouldn't. Why don't we have to do this,

1344
02:14:06.52 --> 02:14:11.16
you know, and boom, you get that support. You get an effective successful marketing campaign.

1345
02:14:11.16 --> 02:14:19.40
Mm-hm. Unless your marketing campaign gets banned. And you can market against them,

1346
02:14:19.40 --> 02:14:23.88
banning your campaign. Yeah, I'm saying. Yeah. But yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a little tricky these days.

1347
02:14:23.88 --> 02:14:30.36
That makes it hard for sure. Bad paper. Bad papers when you get

1348
02:14:30.36 --> 02:14:36.36
less than honorable discharge or other than honorable. When it was time for Project Hunter Kman to

1349
02:14:36.36 --> 02:14:42.28
leave the military men of them received a heavy blow slightly over half of them. 180,000. So there's only

1350
02:14:42.28 --> 02:14:50.36
360,000 of these people. 180,000 were separated with discharges under conditions other than honorable.

1351
02:14:50.36 --> 02:14:55.16
A stigma that made it hard to get good jobs because many employers were not higher veterans who failed

1352
02:14:55.16 --> 02:15:01.000
to produce a certificate of honorable discharge. They were often barred from veterans' benefits,

1353
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.72
such as healthcare, housing assistance, employment, and counseling. Some of them became

1354
02:15:05.72 --> 02:15:11.000
chronically homeless and troubled. Although some bad paper vets have been guilty of serious

1355
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.48
offenses, most have been accused of minor offenses related to the stress of military life and combat,

1356
02:15:15.48 --> 02:15:20.60
a wall, missing duty, abusing alcohol or drugs or taking or talking back to a superior.

1357
02:15:20.60 --> 02:15:30.76
There was a cruel irony in the less than honorable discharges, millions of men who beat the

1358
02:15:30.76 --> 02:15:36.76
draft legally by going to college or getting braces, etc. suffered nothing. In fact, they

1359
02:15:36.76 --> 02:15:42.36
held an advantage over men who served. They got the first crack at jobs, compile, and compiled

1360
02:15:42.36 --> 02:15:48.28
seniority and experience. Even the draft Dodgers who fled to Canada and Sweden got amnesty

1361
02:15:48.28 --> 02:15:55.56
from presidents forward and corridor, but not McNamara's bad paper vets. Unlike the articulate

1362
02:15:55.56 --> 02:15:59.80
politically astute war resistors, they had no one to lobby for them.

1363
02:16:01.80 --> 02:16:06.36
For then he talks about one guy that built Daniel of Nashville who'd been an army recruiter

1364
02:16:06.36 --> 02:16:11.64
in 1967. When he was interviewed 35 years later, he was still bitter about the approximately

1365
02:16:11.64 --> 02:16:16.76
hundred McNamara's morons. He had personally recruited in the slums of Cleveland, Ohio during the

1366
02:16:16.76 --> 02:16:22.60
war. It didn't really sit too good with me, he said, when you are told to do what to do in the

1367
02:16:22.60 --> 02:16:28.92
military, you know what you do what you are told to do. They never should have been in the military.

1368
02:16:28.92 --> 02:16:33.64
Many of the low aptitude men that he and his fellow recruiters signed up or either killed and

1369
02:16:33.64 --> 02:16:37.64
combat when they left the or when they left the army, they were departed with less than honorable

1370
02:16:37.64 --> 02:16:43.40
discharges for such offenses as going a wall in subordination or bed wedding.

1371
02:16:43.40 --> 02:16:48.92
You take a man who can't read or write, he said, he never knew about the firm and

1372
02:16:48.92 --> 02:16:52.52
he comes from the ghetto and he may not want to take orders and you send him into the

1373
02:16:53.16 --> 02:16:58.36
by the most expedient means necessary into combat. That's only going to lead to failure.

1374
02:17:01.80 --> 02:17:07.16
Fast forward a little bit several veterans, counselors in the 1980s told me of similar

1375
02:17:07.16 --> 02:17:12.68
experiences with low-vite low IQ Vietnam veterans when review boards were asked to change a

1376
02:17:12.68 --> 02:17:17.80
discharge from undesirable to general, the uniform officers who were compassionate to a project

1377
02:17:17.80 --> 02:17:25.96
under K-man would approve the change. So you got people trying to get these bad discharges changed

1378
02:17:25.96 --> 02:17:31.32
and the military uniform officers like you. We need to give these guys a break. But they would be

1379
02:17:31.32 --> 02:17:36.76
overruled by civilian superiors who regarded men who had gone a wall as slackers who deserve

1380
02:17:36.76 --> 02:17:43.24
no mercies. In an absurd turn of events some of these civilians who viewed themselves as upholding

1381
02:17:43.24 --> 02:17:49.56
military tradition had been draft of orders during the Vietnam War. There was infuriating to see

1382
02:17:49.56 --> 02:18:00.68
these officials kick the very men who had served in their stead. So here is the the verdict

1383
02:18:00.68 --> 02:18:09.72
kind of puts out some word on McNamara's plan. At the dawn of Project 100K, Robert McNamara

1384
02:18:09.72 --> 02:18:15.56
boasted that the program would quote salvage the poverty, poverty scarred youth of our society

1385
02:18:15.56 --> 02:18:22.28
and at the rate of 100,000 men each year. First, for two years of military service and then for

1386
02:18:22.28 --> 02:18:30.12
a lifetime of product, productive activity in civilian society and call. Despite the soaring

1387
02:18:30.12 --> 02:18:37.88
optimism, Project 100K became known as McNamara's folly. It was a failure bringing more suffering

1388
02:18:37.88 --> 02:18:43.32
than redemption. Though some Project 100K men did well in the service passing basic training

1389
02:18:43.32 --> 02:18:47.64
going on to productive military assignments. Large numbers that had trouble coping with the

1390
02:18:47.64 --> 02:18:53.16
demands of military life. They were often hazed and ridiculed and demeaned. It was ironic that

1391
02:18:53.16 --> 02:18:59.08
McNamara and one of his speeches extoling Project 100K said, I have directed that these men shall

1392
02:18:59.08 --> 02:19:06.36
never be singled out or stigmatized in any manner." And then he puts, somehow his order never

1393
02:19:06.36 --> 02:19:12.68
worked its way down to company level. Some veterans of Project 100K were psychologically

1394
02:19:12.68 --> 02:19:17.56
devastated by the war. Dr. John Wilson, a psychologist at Cleveland State University who spent

1395
02:19:17.56 --> 02:19:21.72
several years studying Vietnam Veterans' emotional problems estimated that thousands of

1396
02:19:21.72 --> 02:19:27.40
Project 100K men who had served in Southeast Asia were so severely messed up that they couldn't

1397
02:19:27.40 --> 02:19:32.84
function in society. When I say severely messed up, I mean they can't hold jobs, raise families,

1398
02:19:32.84 --> 02:19:39.32
and cope with day-to-day living. McNamara had predicted that life after they returned to civilian

1399
02:19:40.28 --> 02:19:47.000
world, Project 100K men would have an earning capacity, quote, two to three times that it would

1400
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:54.28
have been had there been no such program. After the war, however, a follow-up study on Project

1401
02:19:54.28 --> 02:20:03.08
100K men showed that in late 1986 to 1987 labor market, they were either no better offer,

1402
02:20:03.08 --> 02:20:10.60
actually worse off than non-veterans of similar aptitude. So much for McNamara's rosy prediction.

1403
02:20:10.60 --> 02:20:15.64
In 2014, when many Vietnam veterans were entering their retirement years, a study funded by the

1404
02:20:15.64 --> 02:20:21.80
Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that more than 283,000 veterans still suffered from post-traumatic

1405
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:27.08
stress disorder, which was characterized by disabling flashbacks hyper-rausol and sleep problems.

1406
02:20:27.72 --> 02:20:34.20
The key, the study's key takeaway, is that for some PTSD is not going away, said William Schlegler,

1407
02:20:34.84 --> 02:20:41.08
a lead scientist on the study. It is chronic and prolonged for veterans with PTSD the war is not over.

1408
02:20:41.72 --> 02:20:47.48
The study found that low IQ veterans were more likely to suffer from PTSD than high IQ vets.

1409
02:20:47.48 --> 02:20:54.60
Project 100K and McNamara's other failures in the war wrecked his reputation.

1410
02:20:56.04 --> 02:21:02.68
At first admired for his intelligence and analytical prowess, author Thomas Stitt wrote,

1411
02:21:03.72 --> 02:21:09.72
McNamara later became one of the most hated men in America by the officers in the listed personnel he had led.

1412
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:15.72
One officer angry over the abusive, mentally limited men in the armed forces,

1413
02:21:15.72 --> 02:21:20.84
even confronted McNamara in public. At a conference in Washington, D.C. as McNamara touted the

1414
02:21:20.84 --> 02:21:26.60
virtues of Project 100K and Army psychologist, who was treating psychologically afflicted,

1415
02:21:26.60 --> 02:21:31.24
afflicted, afflicted Vietnam veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center stood up and spoke out.

1416
02:21:32.28 --> 02:21:37.72
Although McNamara was a, although a mere captain, Dr. Walter P.

1417
02:21:37.72 --> 02:21:46.92
Nick K. N. A. K. E. told McNamara, what you're doing is wrong. And by the way, Dr. Walter P. Nick,

1418
02:21:48.04 --> 02:21:52.28
I looked him up. He's alive. If you want to come on the podcast, he's invited.

1419
02:21:55.72 --> 02:22:02.52
Did McNamara ever express regret over Project 100,000 by auger for Deborah Shapley says that

1420
02:22:02.52 --> 02:22:11.72
to the very end he refused to apologize or admit error. McNamara wanted to believe the Project 100K

1421
02:22:11.72 --> 02:22:16.76
was a universally successful program, but his self-congregulation was at odds with a

1422
02:22:16.76 --> 02:22:24.84
virtue of most scholars and other observers. Christian Api said Project 100K was instituted with

1423
02:22:24.84 --> 02:22:29.88
high-minded rhetoric about offering the poor and opportunity to serve its result, however,

1424
02:22:29.88 --> 02:22:35.24
was to send many poor, terribly confused and woefully under-educated boys to risk death in Vietnam.

1425
02:22:36.12 --> 02:22:42.20
Any Peabaker, history professor, Wheaton College said Project 100K or McNamara's morons as

1426
02:22:42.20 --> 02:22:46.76
the cruel joke went was a disaster benefiting neither the men nor the armed forces.

1427
02:22:47.48 --> 02:22:53.16
Jacob Helebron of Georgetown University said McNamara's experiment in social engineering had the

1428
02:22:53.16 --> 02:22:58.84
most awful results, including ridicule and training camps in death in Vietnam, Samuel F. Yeet.

1429
02:22:58.84 --> 02:23:05.08
Professor at Howard University said that instead of preparing in poverty, young men with skills

1430
02:23:05.08 --> 02:23:11.48
for a better life, Project 100K was little more than express vehicle to Vietnam. Denouncing McNamara

1431
02:23:11.48 --> 02:23:18.04
for his intellectual arrogance and duplicity, Myra McPherson authored of the Vietnam classic long-time

1432
02:23:18.04 --> 02:23:25.64
passing called Project 100,000, a shameful brainchild and one of the most heinous acts as the chief,

1433
02:23:25.64 --> 02:23:30.20
as one of his most heinous acts as chief architect of the war.

1434
02:23:34.28 --> 02:23:40.84
On the last day of 1971, Project 100K was officially ended and in July of 1971, the draft was

1435
02:23:40.84 --> 02:23:47.16
replaced by the all volunteer force. Passing the AFQT was raised from the 10th percentile,

1436
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:57.24
IQ 72 to the old standard of the 31st percentile IQ of 92. So they did, they shut it down,

1437
02:23:57.80 --> 02:24:04.60
but he goes to point on that this kind of thing still happens. He says in 1976, Charlie Wilson

1438
02:24:04.60 --> 02:24:09.48
Congressman from Texas testified at a hearing about the death of one of his constituents,

1439
02:24:09.48 --> 02:24:17.08
Lynn McHugh McClur, who was a 20-year-old young man from Liffkin, Texas, who had a history of non-success,

1440
02:24:17.08 --> 02:24:21.80
who was mentally retarded, who weighed 115 pounds, somehow got into the Marine Corps and was

1441
02:24:21.80 --> 02:24:26.36
severely beaten during basic training and dietas as a result of those injuries without regaining consciousness.

1442
02:24:27.88 --> 02:24:33.32
Until so, Oklahoma, 1976, 25-year-old man walked out of a state mental institution where he

1443
02:24:33.32 --> 02:24:38.28
lived for 14 years and wandered into a Army recruiting station. He had been diagnosed as having

1444
02:24:38.28 --> 02:24:48.84
what today is called Down Syndrome, was labeled severely retarded. When he entered the recruiting

1445
02:24:48.84 --> 02:24:54.52
station, he was promptly enlisted by a sergeant who, a later investigated investigation revealed

1446
02:24:54.52 --> 02:24:58.12
fate, his test scores, he was sent to Fort O'Rd, California for basic training,

1447
02:24:58.12 --> 02:25:05.16
soon deserted came back to Tulsa, arrested, put in the Fort Sil Stockade to face court marshal,

1448
02:25:05.16 --> 02:25:08.44
psychiatrist, examined him and found the other mental capacity of a nine-year-old.

1449
02:25:10.60 --> 02:25:14.68
He even up to today in the drawn-out wars, and I rack an Afghanistan fast forward a little bit.

1450
02:25:14.68 --> 02:25:19.40
Beginning in 2001, the U.S. did not bring back the draft, but there were many parallels to

1451
02:25:19.40 --> 02:25:23.16
Vietnam as the military accepted low-performing recruits because it was desperate for more

1452
02:25:23.16 --> 02:25:29.56
more soldiers for combat. And Army Private named David Dietrich of Petri Perry County,

1453
02:25:29.56 --> 02:25:34.60
Pennsylvania, was subject of a newsweek article entitled He Never Should Have Gone To I Rack.

1454
02:25:35.64 --> 02:25:39.80
Before and during his Army time, he was considered slow in his thinking and he had trouble

1455
02:25:39.80 --> 02:25:44.84
retaining information and basic training, couldn't hit targets on the rifle range,

1456
02:25:44.84 --> 02:25:49.40
even though he was given extra training, one superior campaign to have Dietrich sent home on grounds

1457
02:25:49.40 --> 02:25:54.44
that he would pose a danger to himself and others if he was sent to I rack, but the request was

1458
02:25:54.44 --> 02:25:59.80
rebuffed by hires up as with Vietnam there was a big push to get troops into the combat zone.

1459
02:25:59.80 --> 02:26:04.12
Soon after he arrived in Iraq, he was assigned to act as a scout and an abandoned building

1460
02:26:04.12 --> 02:26:09.56
where he was supposed to watch from an open window. A few minutes after starting his duty

1461
02:26:11.16 --> 02:26:18.04
in the window he was shot dead. That was a December 2006 in Ramadhi right after we left.

1462
02:26:18.04 --> 02:26:26.84
2007, nine Marine Corps recruiters worked in the Houston area, were punished for using

1463
02:26:26.84 --> 02:26:32.36
stand-ins to take mental tests at the Houston induction center for 15 marginal prospects

1464
02:26:32.36 --> 02:26:35.24
who might not have passed the tests on their own. The fraud was caught by an official

1465
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:39.08
who noticed the signatures of the test takers didn't match those on the enlistment forms.

1466
02:26:39.72 --> 02:26:42.36
No one knew how long the fraudulent test taking had been going on.

1467
02:26:42.36 --> 02:26:47.32
Yeah, that's 2007, by the way.

1468
02:26:49.48 --> 02:26:55.96
From 2004 to 2007, four major branches of the armed forces granted 125,000 mullet waivers

1469
02:26:55.96 --> 02:26:59.88
to override the rule against accepting people with criminal records.

1470
02:27:01.96 --> 02:27:08.60
Stephen Green, Stephen Green, 20, an angry misfit and high school dropout from Midland, Texas,

1471
02:27:08.60 --> 02:27:13.000
who had racked up jail time for drug and alcohol offenses before he joined the army with a moral

1472
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:19.96
waiver. In 2006, Green and four other soldiers, and Iraq drank alcohol, changed into black clothes,

1473
02:27:19.96 --> 02:27:24.44
and then raided the home of a husband and wife and their two daughters, Green killed the parents

1474
02:27:24.44 --> 02:27:28.92
and the younger daughter, then he and a second soldier raped the 14-year-old daughter,

1475
02:27:28.92 --> 02:27:33.32
shot her, sent fire to her daughter to just body to try to destroy the evidence.

1476
02:27:33.32 --> 02:27:37.56
His convicted of rape and murder and sent it to life in prison.

1477
02:27:38.52 --> 02:27:40.76
2014, he committed suicide by hanging.

1478
02:27:45.72 --> 02:27:47.16
But why is that guy in the military?

1479
02:27:53.40 --> 02:27:54.84
Here's the closer of this book.

1480
02:27:57.72 --> 02:28:00.36
One of the lessons of McMarr's Project, Condord K,

1481
02:28:00.36 --> 02:28:04.76
is that the low-appitude individuals should never be used in war zone or in a dangerous,

1482
02:28:04.76 --> 02:28:08.92
re-rational on areas, putting their lives at risk as cruel and immoral,

1483
02:28:08.92 --> 02:28:13.24
and on sheer practical level, it degrades the effectiveness of war efforts.

1484
02:28:13.24 --> 02:28:17.48
The least intelligent among us should never be viewed as expendable units of man powers.

1485
02:28:19.16 --> 02:28:24.12
But as our fellow so-journers on this fragile earth, deserving respect and compassion,

1486
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:28.04
and gratitude for the contributions they make to our families and our society.

1487
02:28:28.04 --> 02:28:34.28
While vowing to never again induct people with intellectual disabilities,

1488
02:28:34.28 --> 02:28:39.40
American should also heed warnings by military leaders that it is a mistake to take inductees

1489
02:28:39.40 --> 02:28:44.76
who have criminal backgrounds, medical defects, social maladjustment, and psychiatric disorders.

1490
02:28:46.20 --> 02:28:50.36
The armed forces need and deserve the best and the brightest.

1491
02:28:52.60 --> 02:28:57.64
One of the wisest quotations that I recorded earlier in this book comes from Lieutenant Colonel

1492
02:28:57.64 --> 02:29:04.28
John Leslie John Shellhase, a World War II veteran who helped create Project Hundred K,

1493
02:29:04.28 --> 02:29:07.24
but who strongly opposed ascending the men in a combat.

1494
02:29:08.76 --> 02:29:13.96
Coat wars are not one by using marginal man powers can and fodder,

1495
02:29:15.16 --> 02:29:21.000
but rather by risking and sometimes losing the flower of a nation's youth.

1496
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:35.40
So, there you have it. Not exactly an uplifting book, definitely worth buying,

1497
02:29:35.40 --> 02:29:41.000
definitely worth reading, but it's not gonna. Not gonna make you feel any better about things.

1498
02:29:43.40 --> 02:29:48.52
And then this is the one why read it. What do we take away from it? Why we talk about on this podcast?

1499
02:29:48.52 --> 02:29:54.20
Because what can we learn from it? That's the thing. What can we learn from it?

1500
02:29:54.20 --> 02:30:01.000
And I think one of the big things we can learn from it is you have to push back. You have to

1501
02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.36
question, you have to question authority. Authority is not always right. Just because someone is

1502
02:30:04.36 --> 02:30:11.32
in a position of authority doesn't mean they're right. And in fact, an indicator of them not being

1503
02:30:11.32 --> 02:30:16.60
right is when they impose things on you. That's an indicator that they're not right. If you have to

1504
02:30:16.60 --> 02:30:20.44
impose something on someone, it's an indication that you're what you're doing is not right.

1505
02:30:20.44 --> 02:30:23.56
And if you're having something imposed on you, that's an indication that whoever's

1506
02:30:23.56 --> 02:30:30.28
imposing on it is not right. Or at least they're not confirmed. Because if I have to impose

1507
02:30:30.28 --> 02:30:37.56
something on you, why? Why? If I can't explain to you how this is gonna help you, help your family,

1508
02:30:37.56 --> 02:30:41.64
help your community, help your country, if I can't explain that to you. And the only way I can

1509
02:30:41.64 --> 02:30:51.08
get you to do something is by imposing on you, there's a good chance it's wrong. So again, back to my

1510
02:30:51.08 --> 02:30:58.52
earlier emotional reaction to the draft Dodgers, right? So it's I understand it. Once I took a step back,

1511
02:31:00.12 --> 02:31:08.92
you you understand. It's look, I understand it. Does it still make me angry that there's people

1512
02:31:08.92 --> 02:31:15.000
that look, can you imagine watching your again, I'm gonna get emotional, but you watch your neighbor

1513
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:21.40
go off to war while you stay at home. There's something wrong with that picture. So from that level,

1514
02:31:22.28 --> 02:31:27.08
I don't, I can't understand it can't agree with it. When you start looking at it from a level of,

1515
02:31:27.08 --> 02:31:32.92
oh, this is being imposed on the country. And the leadership can't explain why it's happening.

1516
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:39.000
And they're trying to sell it to us and they can't even sell it to us. They can't. So they have to impose.

1517
02:31:40.36 --> 02:31:46.04
So we have a moral responsibility to question authority, to question the government,

1518
02:31:47.16 --> 02:31:55.40
to figure out what it is we're actually doing. And you know, you take a guy like McNamara,

1519
02:31:55.40 --> 02:31:59.000
I could probably, we should probably do a huge podcast about McNamara at some point.

1520
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Um, because he, all the things that I talk about for bad leadership, he knocks a bunch of them out of the

1521
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:15.80
park. Uh, he, he doesn't understand people. He only listens to statistics. There's a, there's a,

1522
02:32:15.80 --> 02:32:22.68
I know you like biases. Eccotrals. Yes. The McNamara fallacy. You've heard of that. The McNamara

1523
02:32:22.68 --> 02:32:29.48
bias. That's when you just go off a statistics. You just look at the numbers and you make a decision based

1524
02:32:30.44 --> 02:32:35.08
on your quantitative observations. And that's it based on the metrics. They're metrics. They're

1525
02:32:35.08 --> 02:32:40.44
like, that's what we're doing. It's a fallacy. It doesn't account for emotions. It doesn't account

1526
02:32:40.44 --> 02:32:45.72
for personalities. It doesn't account for the human side of things. And it doesn't work.

1527
02:32:45.72 --> 02:32:56.76
So we can learn about leadership by reading this book. And we can learn clearly that we also have a

1528
02:32:56.76 --> 02:33:03.16
moral obligation to protect people that are weak, protect people that are mentally and physically

1529
02:33:03.16 --> 02:33:09.56
disabled. And we need to be empathetic to other people to understand what they're where they're

1530
02:33:09.56 --> 02:33:14.44
coming from. Like you read about some of those leaders in this book where, you know, the platoon commander

1531
02:33:14.44 --> 02:33:21.88
took the the the McNamara 100K soldier took them under his wing, protected him took care of them.

1532
02:33:22.60 --> 02:33:29.72
And there's a bunch of examples and they're like that. Don't put people in the positions that

1533
02:33:29.72 --> 02:33:34.84
they cannot handle. And I'm not talking about don't push people, but don't put them in a

1534
02:33:34.84 --> 02:33:39.32
situation, especially if they're going to be hazardous to them, where they can get hurt or killed

1535
02:33:39.32 --> 02:33:46.92
if they haven't been trained if they're not capable of doing that thing. Certainly don't put them in danger.

1536
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.60
What does that mean? It means be a good freaky human being. That's what it means.

1537
02:33:53.96 --> 02:34:01.32
Be a good person. That's what I learned. Yeah, did they, I mean, one day kind of laid that out.

1538
02:34:03.88 --> 02:34:09.000
Like all this program is going to have this this benefit on these people who otherwise

1539
02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.80
wouldn't have these benefits. They're going to be trained. They're going to be more capable

1540
02:34:11.80 --> 02:34:19.24
and all this stuff or whatever. And it's like, you kind of wondered, did they believe that? Because

1541
02:34:19.24 --> 02:34:23.80
if you do like us, what's the opposite of a straw man? I think it's called, I don't know, the tiger

1542
02:34:23.80 --> 02:34:29.40
man. I don't know, whatever. I think it's still man. Still man. So steel man argument for that is kind of like,

1543
02:34:29.40 --> 02:34:34.84
yeah, like there are success stories and those success stories kind of play out exactly how they're

1544
02:34:34.84 --> 02:34:42.92
purporting. This is going to end up like everyone. But like I said, like it's not a vacuum and it's

1545
02:34:42.92 --> 02:34:47.64
not, you know, people are different. And when you kind of take it as a whole, the reality sets in where

1546
02:34:47.64 --> 02:34:54.04
it's like, no man, this is going to leave people straight up dead, confused, freaking like

1547
02:34:54.04 --> 02:35:02.36
worse off, you know, because all of the unintended consequences. But you wonder like, I wonder if

1548
02:35:02.36 --> 02:35:07.88
that was on purpose that they're kind of like, oh, yeah, maybe all these other consequences or did

1549
02:35:07.88 --> 02:35:14.84
they really kind of think that. Yeah, that's you could see that McNamara is surrounded by

1550
02:35:15.40 --> 02:35:21.16
Yesmen. So here's the thing, I might believe something. But I'm surrounded by people that be a

1551
02:35:21.16 --> 02:35:26.12
hedgehog, that might not be the best idea. And I'll even say that myself. Wait, am I really,

1552
02:35:26.12 --> 02:35:33.32
are we really going to take a kid from some rural area that's got a fourth grade education that's

1553
02:35:33.32 --> 02:35:40.68
got an IQ of 60 and we're going to turn their lives around or take some kid from the inner city ghetto.

1554
02:35:40.68 --> 02:35:46.20
And all of a sudden, oh, the inner city ghetto kid with an IQ of 64 is going to be like, oh,

1555
02:35:46.20 --> 02:35:50.52
great. I'm looking forward to following orders and peeling potatoes in the US army. Like,

1556
02:35:50.52 --> 02:35:58.04
we impose, we overlay our thoughts on the people that we have no idea what they're like.

1557
02:35:58.04 --> 02:36:01.56
Yeah, and that's the point, right there where you have no idea. Yeah, you're like, oh, yeah,

1558
02:36:01.56 --> 02:36:05.96
this guy's going to be more capable. Like, well, how do you know, like even, I'm not saying no one's

1559
02:36:05.96 --> 02:36:10.68
going to, but then you're you're counting for like so many people, so many different types of people,

1560
02:36:10.68 --> 02:36:16.52
by the way. And you're assigning one, your sense, your solution. You're also assigning

1561
02:36:16.52 --> 02:36:21.88
your values and your perspective to a bunch of other people. Yeah. Yeah. That's the worst part.

1562
02:36:21.88 --> 02:36:25.80
You're assigning your values and your perspective to a bunch of other people, which is a freaking

1563
02:36:25.80 --> 02:36:32.84
massive mistake. Well, of course, they're going to get on board. Of course, of course, they're going

1564
02:36:32.84 --> 02:36:36.36
to get on board. Yeah. It doesn't happen. You don't want to see that you see that with your kids.

1565
02:36:36.36 --> 02:36:41.40
You're like, I'm just like, so many kids would have killed for the opportunity to do this. Yeah,

1566
02:36:41.40 --> 02:36:50.68
yeah. You know, you're like, you're imposing your your values and your perspective on other

1567
02:36:50.68 --> 02:36:55.24
people. And it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Sure, Mac and Mirrors like, hey, this is, you know,

1568
02:36:56.28 --> 02:37:03.24
Johnny from wherever this rural area in the middle of nowhere, whose main goal in life is to

1569
02:37:03.24 --> 02:37:11.24
have freaking work at the service station because he likes cars. That's a good point with a kid's

1570
02:37:11.24 --> 02:37:17.64
right. So my brother was talking to my daughter and he used like doing some math problem,

1571
02:37:17.64 --> 02:37:22.92
you know, on the thing. Oh, yeah. And he's like, all in do it, you know, and then she tells

1572
02:37:22.92 --> 02:37:27.000
she was like kind of bored with it. And she's like, oh, like, let's do something else wherever he's

1573
02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:32.68
like, oh, no, no, math is fun. And then like, maybe my wife were looking at each other like, oh,

1574
02:37:32.68 --> 02:37:38.60
what the hell is this good to go to? Is he thinking he's talking to you know, eight year old girl is

1575
02:37:38.60 --> 02:37:42.52
going to be like, yeah, yeah. And there's a small population of the world that thinks it's fun.

1576
02:37:42.52 --> 02:37:48.28
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, actually, one of them. And he and Jade, Jade Charles, not going to be

1577
02:37:48.28 --> 02:37:54.92
all the imposes perspectives on her. Oh, yeah. So that's another good thing to be very careful of

1578
02:37:54.92 --> 02:37:59.96
that McNamara can teach us because in his mind, everyone's just thinking the way he's thinking.

1579
02:37:59.96 --> 02:38:03.80
And then surrounded by a bunch of yes men that are saying, yeah, of course, little Johnny and

1580
02:38:03.80 --> 02:38:08.68
the rural area or this kid down in the ghetto, Johnny and the ghetto is going to be just down

1581
02:38:08.68 --> 02:38:12.44
for the cause. Yeah, they're going to be capable of what a great opportunity. Right. Right.

1582
02:38:12.44 --> 02:38:16.20
Great opportunity. Yeah. Well, oh, you're going to send me to freaking army boot camp.

1583
02:38:17.24 --> 02:38:21.000
That sounds like a great opportunity to thank you so much for this educational opportunity.

1584
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:26.92
Yeah. And thinking he's all benevolent. It's a good question that you posed. Did they actually

1585
02:38:26.92 --> 02:38:33.000
believe that or was that just propaganda? It's a good question. I get my guesses. They believed it.

1586
02:38:33.80 --> 02:38:38.12
Yeah, especially if it's not. But the thing is the army got the uniform.

1587
02:38:38.12 --> 02:38:41.48
My people's are going to do no bad call. Not going to work.

1588
02:38:42.12 --> 02:38:46.20
Then again, think about it because you could see like one of these people, especially if you're

1589
02:38:46.20 --> 02:38:51.88
used to just like handling people and that with that kind of numbers, you know, we need a thousand

1590
02:38:51.88 --> 02:38:56.52
guys here. We need 10,000 guys. Like who are we going to put? Like you're not dealing with

1591
02:38:56.52 --> 02:39:01.40
he actual human beings anymore in your head. You're like, oh, get the guys who don't have

1592
02:39:01.40 --> 02:39:05.88
nothing to live for. Throw them in the air. Yeah. You know, we'll give an opportunity. Yeah.

1593
02:39:05.88 --> 02:39:10.52
Fuh. They should be happy. They should be thankful. When I started teaching Jiu Jitsu to like

1594
02:39:10.52 --> 02:39:17.96
team guys, the funny thing is I thought that every I thought that I would have a

1595
02:39:19.96 --> 02:39:27.16
rate of acceptance and wanting to train of 100%. Everybody, hey, that when I show this to you,

1596
02:39:27.16 --> 02:39:31.88
you're going to 100% I'm going to, well, how am I going to do this? How am I going to train all

1597
02:39:31.88 --> 02:39:35.48
these guys all the time? They're just going to want to train. I'm not doing the morning or through

1598
02:39:35.48 --> 02:39:41.40
the night when we train all the time, I imposed my perspective on everybody and my values on it.

1599
02:39:41.96 --> 02:39:49.16
And the reality is I would get probably out of every 20 people, 20 people out of

1600
02:39:49.16 --> 02:39:56.12
introduced Jitsu, one out of 20 would be into it. See, and even that kind of maybe is my bias,

1601
02:39:56.12 --> 02:40:00.76
but that to me seems like that's a reasonable expectation. That's how long you've got to tell

1602
02:40:00.76 --> 02:40:08.84
wrong I am and I am an actual seal. It's not like I'm talking about some other group of people.

1603
02:40:08.84 --> 02:40:14.20
This is I'm a seal I've been a seal for 10 years at this point and I'm thinking, oh, of course,

1604
02:40:14.20 --> 02:40:18.60
anyone that I show this to is going to be bought in one of those train all the time. You know seals?

1605
02:40:18.60 --> 02:40:26.12
You know what I think? Yeah, for sure. So I was wrong. I'm wrong. And that's one of those things.

1606
02:40:26.12 --> 02:40:30.36
It's saying that you have C2 when I went to Virginia and watch the UFC. It's the same thing. I

1607
02:40:30.36 --> 02:40:35.40
realized I'm wrong. That's another thing. You teaching guys to Jitsu. I'm wrong. Not everyone's into it.

1608
02:40:35.40 --> 02:40:40.44
Not everyone thinks I got to think. Some people think way better than me. Some people think different than me.

1609
02:40:40.44 --> 02:40:46.52
But I cannot overlay my perspective on people and neither can you. So don't do it. Watch out

1610
02:40:46.52 --> 02:40:52.60
if you're doing that. It's a bias. I want to what that bias is called. When I overlay my perspective on you,

1611
02:40:54.44 --> 02:41:00.20
I think everyone thinks the way I think. They don't. In fact, almost no one thinks the way

1612
02:41:00.20 --> 02:41:05.24
you think. And that's a funny thing. Team guys do think alike. There's a whole lot of group think going on.

1613
02:41:06.04 --> 02:41:12.44
You know, everyone likes certain stuff. There's a huge overlap for the amount of people that are in the

1614
02:41:12.44 --> 02:41:17.64
seals. The venn diagram of like interest and what we think is funny and what we think is cool.

1615
02:41:17.64 --> 02:41:22.20
It's a big overlap. And I'll tell you what, in the 90s it was an even bigger overlap.

1616
02:41:22.20 --> 02:41:25.88
Because there was a much less culture that you were exposed to because you didn't have the internet.

1617
02:41:25.88 --> 02:41:30.28
So you know, if you were going to get exposed to music, it was going to be from some other team guy.

1618
02:41:30.28 --> 02:41:34.36
That was going to be checked this band out. Alice and chains. Okay, cool. Let me check it out.

1619
02:41:34.76 --> 02:41:40.28
There was no one introducing you to some random band from Ohio that you never heard of. Whereas now you can just

1620
02:41:40.92 --> 02:41:49.64
battle just pop up on your stream. So in the 90s, it was a much more unified group.

1621
02:41:49.64 --> 02:41:58.12
And that's why that to each team had its own little personality. And each put tune inside the team had its own little personality.

1622
02:41:58.12 --> 02:42:04.04
Now the world is more, there's so many more fractions that you can get into.

1623
02:42:04.84 --> 02:42:09.000
Which when you think of it from a global perspective is bringing people together.

1624
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:14.36
Because now everyone listens to more music. Everyone sees a bunch of movies.

1625
02:42:14.36 --> 02:42:23.96
When I grew up, music was a thing. A record cost freaking, you know, 799, which was a lot of money.

1626
02:42:25.40 --> 02:42:29.72
So you didn't buy a bunch of records. You didn't get to listen to a bunch of different music.

1627
02:42:30.12 --> 02:42:35.08
Not like now what you can listen to anything you want. You hear of a band for one split second.

1628
02:42:35.08 --> 02:42:37.08
You can get their whole catalog for nothing.

1629
02:42:37.08 --> 02:42:46.28
That's too home. Like, see, but remember, even like movies, like you'd have to go buy the tape.

1630
02:42:46.28 --> 02:42:54.52
Yeah, and everyone in 1985, everyone saw the movie. Because it was only nine movies.

1631
02:42:54.52 --> 02:42:57.88
Everyone saw. Yeah. It's true. Everyone heard the song.

1632
02:42:58.76 --> 02:43:04.04
Everyone knew that album because everyone had that album. That was the only album that was to get 1984

1633
02:43:04.04 --> 02:43:07.16
by Van Hale and every single person I knew had that album.

1634
02:43:07.16 --> 02:43:07.72
Yeah.

1635
02:43:07.72 --> 02:43:08.68
In 1984.

1636
02:43:09.88 --> 02:43:13.24
Every, that's crazy, right? Every single person knew that.

1637
02:43:13.24 --> 02:43:15.88
I don't know any hit songs right now. I'm on any of them.

1638
02:43:16.52 --> 02:43:18.92
I don't even know what a hit song. Is there such a big anymore?

1639
02:43:20.92 --> 02:43:22.84
I don't know, but I'm listening to music.

1640
02:43:23.40 --> 02:43:26.36
I'm listening to it. I'm even listening to new music that's coming out.

1641
02:43:26.36 --> 02:43:28.76
But I'm not listening to what everyone else is listening to.

1642
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.08
So we have a less unified situation.

1643
02:43:33.08 --> 02:43:38.60
But if that makes it even harder for me to impose my little ideas on you and

1644
02:43:38.60 --> 02:43:41.56
and transfer my values on to you. Don't work.

1645
02:43:44.04 --> 02:43:48.68
Sure. All right. Well, we want to help people.

1646
02:43:48.68 --> 02:43:54.52
You know, we definitely want to help people out. And let's talk about some things that might be

1647
02:43:54.52 --> 02:44:01.56
able to help people out. Yeah. We here are doing a few things to help people.

1648
02:44:01.56 --> 02:44:05.08
Because we are on this path. And if we're not, we're trying to be most of us.

1649
02:44:05.80 --> 02:44:09.000
I'm not just going to impose my, I'm not just going to assume.

1650
02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:09.32
Mm-hmm.

1651
02:44:09.32 --> 02:44:10.12
It's not what I'm going to do.

1652
02:44:10.12 --> 02:44:14.68
So here's the deal. What are, what is it that people may need in the world right now?

1653
02:44:14.68 --> 02:44:16.84
I can tell you one thing that people mean from time to time.

1654
02:44:17.72 --> 02:44:19.56
Sometimes you need a little extra.

1655
02:44:20.12 --> 02:44:21.24
Let's call it energy.

1656
02:44:23.24 --> 02:44:24.28
Energy helps for sure.

1657
02:44:24.28 --> 02:44:27.08
Because the energy will help you to get through.

1658
02:44:27.08 --> 02:44:29.000
Maybe you got to work, to do.

1659
02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.88
Maybe you got to work out to do. Maybe you got the Gitsu to do.

1660
02:44:31.88 --> 02:44:34.84
Maybe you want to stretch. Maybe you want to get up.

1661
02:44:34.84 --> 02:44:38.36
This stuff we got to do. Maybe you got to just focus on getting done with some work.

1662
02:44:38.36 --> 02:44:39.96
So you can go work out. Yeah.

1663
02:44:39.96 --> 02:44:41.32
So sometimes you need some energy.

1664
02:44:41.32 --> 02:44:43.64
Just. We made some energy. We made some energy.

1665
02:44:44.92 --> 02:44:48.60
We're leasing projects that we're releasing in energy into your brain and body.

1666
02:44:48.60 --> 02:44:52.44
Yes. So if you're, if you're into energy drinks or

1667
02:44:53.96 --> 02:44:58.04
you think you might benefit again. This is me just not imposing my, my way to second.

1668
02:44:58.04 --> 02:45:00.68
Even if you're not in energy drinks because you might not be.

1669
02:45:00.68 --> 02:45:02.84
There's a good chance I wasn't in energy drinks.

1670
02:45:02.84 --> 02:45:04.44
Oh, yeah, especially if it's for a reason.

1671
02:45:04.44 --> 02:45:07.96
Because the reason I wasn't in energy drinks is because they were made of poison.

1672
02:45:07.96 --> 02:45:11.08
Yes. And I wasn't going to put poison into my body.

1673
02:45:11.08 --> 02:45:11.96
No, no.

1674
02:45:11.96 --> 02:45:17.000
Despite the fact that it might give me a short term gain of like a little bit of hype.

1675
02:45:17.56 --> 02:45:20.52
Then I have a long crash. I have health issues. I have a whole deal.

1676
02:45:20.52 --> 02:45:22.20
Yep. So what I'm not doing that?

1677
02:45:22.20 --> 02:45:25.72
Nope. We got a good news. We got a new era of energy drinks.

1678
02:45:25.72 --> 02:45:28.52
Uh, Jocco discipline go.

1679
02:45:28.52 --> 02:45:31.64
Energy drink all healthy. No sugar.

1680
02:45:32.44 --> 02:45:33.48
It's sweet still.

1681
02:45:33.48 --> 02:45:34.12
Mm-hmm.

1682
02:45:34.12 --> 02:45:34.60
Good.

1683
02:45:34.60 --> 02:45:34.92
Monk fruit.

1684
02:45:34.92 --> 02:45:36.76
Got the monk fruit. See?

1685
02:45:36.76 --> 02:45:39.08
So good stuff. No artificial stuff in there.

1686
02:45:39.08 --> 02:45:42.04
Not all natural. No preservatives even.

1687
02:45:42.04 --> 02:45:44.44
So this is a healthy energy drink.

1688
02:45:44.44 --> 02:45:45.08
Yeah.

1689
02:45:45.08 --> 02:45:47.64
Good. Good front side. Good back side.

1690
02:45:47.64 --> 02:45:48.60
Boom. Good to go.

1691
02:45:48.60 --> 02:45:50.04
You'll be healthy to be better.

1692
02:45:50.04 --> 02:45:51.80
Strong strategic and tactical.

1693
02:45:51.80 --> 02:45:53.32
This has to go in straight.

1694
02:45:53.32 --> 02:45:55.48
Take a good one. So yes, you're correct.

1695
02:45:55.48 --> 02:45:59.80
You can not be into energy drinks per se and still be into this.

1696
02:45:59.80 --> 02:46:01.88
And it's helpful on this path that one.

1697
02:46:01.88 --> 02:46:02.68
So we're good.

1698
02:46:02.68 --> 02:46:04.68
So we are good to go. So check those out.

1699
02:46:04.68 --> 02:46:05.64
Yes, check those out.

1700
02:46:06.44 --> 02:46:09.000
You know, try once you which flavor is your favorite?

1701
02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.20
We got powder too.

1702
02:46:10.20 --> 02:46:11.000
By the way, yeah.

1703
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.60
You can get a powdered form of that.

1704
02:46:12.60 --> 02:46:14.68
You get a powdered discipline go.

1705
02:46:14.68 --> 02:46:16.04
We work out.

1706
02:46:16.04 --> 02:46:16.92
Yeah.

1707
02:46:16.92 --> 02:46:17.80
Oh yeah.

1708
02:46:17.80 --> 02:46:21.24
And that's another good one where the traditional pre-workout.

1709
02:46:21.24 --> 02:46:23.40
I can see why people are not into that. Here's a thing.

1710
02:46:23.40 --> 02:46:24.60
I'll even admit it.

1711
02:46:24.60 --> 02:46:28.92
I was kind of, I got off from for various reasons for kind of the reason we're talking about.

1712
02:46:28.92 --> 02:46:32.12
It's like I know the benefits of a traditional pre-workout.

1713
02:46:32.12 --> 02:46:34.36
But you got to EPA a price with those, you know,

1714
02:46:34.36 --> 02:46:35.88
with all the stuff in them and all this stuff.

1715
02:46:35.88 --> 02:46:39.48
And you kind of get, there's like this itchy feeling

1716
02:46:39.48 --> 02:46:43.08
that you get on your face and all this stuff from the pre-workout.

1717
02:46:43.08 --> 02:46:43.88
It is weird.

1718
02:46:43.88 --> 02:46:48.04
But when it comes with that booster, whatever you kind of accept it,

1719
02:46:48.04 --> 02:46:49.80
then you kind of embrace it, then it's kind of like, yeah,

1720
02:46:49.80 --> 02:46:51.72
you know, it's working kind of a thing.

1721
02:46:51.72 --> 02:46:53.08
But after a while, you're like,

1722
02:46:53.08 --> 02:46:56.28
I don't know if I should be taking this stuff for a while.

1723
02:46:56.28 --> 02:46:57.40
So I kind of stopped.

1724
02:46:57.40 --> 02:46:58.76
But this one's not like that.

1725
02:46:58.76 --> 02:47:02.60
So this pre-workout discipline go pre-workout.

1726
02:47:02.60 --> 02:47:05.64
Doesn't give you all that weird jittery, all that weird,

1727
02:47:05.64 --> 02:47:10.04
downside, the itchy face, even though some of us might still like it,

1728
02:47:10.04 --> 02:47:11.96
even though that's not very beneficial in the workout.

1729
02:47:11.96 --> 02:47:14.84
You just working out with itchy face, working out with that,

1730
02:47:14.84 --> 02:47:16.04
with not an itchy face.

1731
02:47:16.04 --> 02:47:17.24
That's the only difference.

1732
02:47:17.24 --> 02:47:22.28
Almost for as HVs goes, but still gives you the good workout,

1733
02:47:22.28 --> 02:47:24.68
the vaso dilation that we look for.

1734
02:47:24.68 --> 02:47:26.44
Yeah, really good.

1735
02:47:26.44 --> 02:47:29.96
So you got the, you got the pills, by the way,

1736
02:47:29.96 --> 02:47:31.72
if you need to take that quicker.

1737
02:47:31.72 --> 02:47:33.96
And look, then you're going to go blast the workout.

1738
02:47:33.96 --> 02:47:35.56
Blah, shrap, yes.

1739
02:47:35.56 --> 02:47:37.08
And then guys where you need to,

1740
02:47:37.08 --> 02:47:39.32
it's a protein, yeah, I think it needs to protein the recovery.

1741
02:47:39.32 --> 02:47:42.60
I have an announcement to make to the world.

1742
02:47:42.60 --> 02:47:43.96
Right on me.

1743
02:47:43.96 --> 02:47:46.92
Um, you know Elvis Presley,

1744
02:47:46.92 --> 02:47:50.60
I guess the last thing that he ate before he died was a peanut butter

1745
02:47:50.60 --> 02:47:51.72
banana sandwich.

1746
02:47:51.72 --> 02:47:52.76
Oh, okay.

1747
02:47:52.76 --> 02:47:54.76
Now this is the King of Rock and Roll.

1748
02:47:54.76 --> 02:47:55.56
You don't understand?

1749
02:47:55.56 --> 02:47:56.36
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1750
02:47:56.36 --> 02:47:57.72
The King of Rock and Roll.

1751
02:47:57.72 --> 02:48:02.76
We have to, we have to hold his opinions

1752
02:48:02.76 --> 02:48:06.04
at some level of reverence because he is the King of Rock and Roll.

1753
02:48:06.04 --> 02:48:07.24
Sure.

1754
02:48:07.24 --> 02:48:09.96
Now unfortunately for him, he won healthy, right?

1755
02:48:09.96 --> 02:48:12.60
You've got the, you know, things got the best of him.

1756
02:48:12.60 --> 02:48:16.28
Maybe the peanut butter, he had fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches, right?

1757
02:48:16.28 --> 02:48:18.12
Oh, the sandwich was fried.

1758
02:48:18.12 --> 02:48:18.92
Yeah.

1759
02:48:18.92 --> 02:48:20.12
Upside taste.

1760
02:48:20.12 --> 02:48:21.08
Real good, right?

1761
02:48:21.08 --> 02:48:23.96
Downside, just off there.

1762
02:48:23.96 --> 02:48:25.000
There's a lot of downside.

1763
02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.12
Yes, sir.

1764
02:48:26.12 --> 02:48:27.32
There's a lot of downside.

1765
02:48:27.32 --> 02:48:30.84
So we can, we can actually have an upside upside.

1766
02:48:30.84 --> 02:48:31.96
You want that taste?

1767
02:48:31.96 --> 02:48:34.36
Take, get some peanut butter,

1768
02:48:34.36 --> 02:48:37.40
mok, get some banana cream mok,

1769
02:48:37.40 --> 02:48:40.44
put one screw of each and you got yourself a little treat.

1770
02:48:40.44 --> 02:48:43.16
Oh, you got yourself a little Elvis treat.

1771
02:48:43.16 --> 02:48:45.000
I'll tell you if you want a boost down one,

1772
02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.28
which that's a good move right there.

1773
02:48:46.28 --> 02:48:47.96
And I'm literally going to try that.

1774
02:48:47.96 --> 02:48:49.08
That's so good.

1775
02:48:49.08 --> 02:48:53.16
So you get one scoop banana, banana cream bomber to be specific.

1776
02:48:53.16 --> 02:48:54.68
One scoop peanut butter chocolate.

1777
02:48:55.72 --> 02:48:58.52
Then you put half a cup chocolate milk.

1778
02:48:58.52 --> 02:48:59.32
The milk.

1779
02:48:59.32 --> 02:49:03.000
The rest regular milk or I'm milk whatever you like.

1780
02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.92
And then one frozen banana.

1781
02:49:04.92 --> 02:49:06.92
Seems like oh and one scoop peanut butter.

1782
02:49:06.92 --> 02:49:08.60
But this is untested what you're talking about.

1783
02:49:08.60 --> 02:49:09.56
This is my hypothesis.

1784
02:49:09.56 --> 02:49:11.96
Before you do that, try what I just said.

1785
02:49:11.96 --> 02:49:12.76
Yeah.

1786
02:49:12.76 --> 02:49:17.000
Mix your fluid of choice almond milk, coconut milk.

1787
02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:18.60
What, what, what's other one?

1788
02:49:18.60 --> 02:49:20.20
Oat milk, I guess.

1789
02:49:20.20 --> 02:49:21.72
Or dairy milk.

1790
02:49:21.72 --> 02:49:22.76
Or regular milk.

1791
02:49:22.76 --> 02:49:25.88
Just try one and one and tell me what you think.

1792
02:49:25.88 --> 02:49:28.28
Before you used to go crazy before you're out there

1793
02:49:28.28 --> 02:49:30.36
getting chocolate milk down the store.

1794
02:49:30.36 --> 02:49:32.76
Get your up, tell us these banana out the freezer.

1795
02:49:32.76 --> 02:49:36.92
I'm an advocate of getting cream.

1796
02:49:36.92 --> 02:49:39.40
Because it's one of those things where you have like the perfect base.

1797
02:49:39.40 --> 02:49:40.76
Because you don't need anything additional.

1798
02:49:40.76 --> 02:49:42.04
You don't need this perfect.

1799
02:49:42.04 --> 02:49:43.56
As far as like just to the handsman.

1800
02:49:43.56 --> 02:49:45.16
Oh, I got video that you make.

1801
02:49:46.44 --> 02:49:47.40
Yeah, something like that.

1802
02:49:47.40 --> 02:49:48.12
Yeah, exactly.

1803
02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:50.28
So yes, perfect.

1804
02:49:50.28 --> 02:49:52.36
Best tasting protein that there is.

1805
02:49:53.32 --> 02:49:53.72
Really?

1806
02:49:53.72 --> 02:49:55.000
Yeah, it's a boom.

1807
02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:55.96
That's going to help you up.

1808
02:49:55.96 --> 02:49:56.76
Get yourself some more.

1809
02:49:56.76 --> 02:49:59.000
Get yourself some mobility and joint health.

1810
02:49:59.000 --> 02:49:59.32
Right?

1811
02:49:59.32 --> 02:50:01.16
That's where we got that joint warfare that criloil.

1812
02:50:01.96 --> 02:50:05.40
Go, go read reviews of of either one of those two.

1813
02:50:05.40 --> 02:50:06.20
Let's see what's up.

1814
02:50:06.20 --> 02:50:06.76
Yeah.

1815
02:50:06.76 --> 02:50:07.40
That's true.

1816
02:50:07.40 --> 02:50:07.80
Yeah.

1817
02:50:07.80 --> 02:50:10.36
Also, you need every, oh yeah, you go on that immunity.

1818
02:50:10.36 --> 02:50:10.84
You do.

1819
02:50:10.84 --> 02:50:13.08
Yeah, we do want the immunity.

1820
02:50:13.08 --> 02:50:15.88
So immunity and joint, by the way, is one of those things we're

1821
02:50:15.88 --> 02:50:17.72
men until you get compromised.

1822
02:50:17.72 --> 02:50:18.84
It gets compromised.

1823
02:50:18.84 --> 02:50:19.32
Like not.

1824
02:50:19.32 --> 02:50:21.000
We might not think about it all the time.

1825
02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.48
But boom, you got to stay ahead of that train right there.

1826
02:50:24.28 --> 02:50:28.12
So yes, vitamin D3 and SAA product substance.

1827
02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:30.92
Capitals called Cold War.

1828
02:50:31.64 --> 02:50:33.80
Oh, man, those will keep you out of a jam for sure.

1829
02:50:33.80 --> 02:50:34.44
Out of the jam.

1830
02:50:34.44 --> 02:50:37.16
I'll see if your kids get some more of your kid milk for those kids.

1831
02:50:37.16 --> 02:50:38.84
We don't want to poison our children.

1832
02:50:38.84 --> 02:50:39.16
No.

1833
02:50:39.16 --> 02:50:40.76
Seems obvious.

1834
02:50:40.76 --> 02:50:42.04
You wouldn't even think you'd need to say that.

1835
02:50:42.04 --> 02:50:44.76
And yet go to the store and look at what people are buying.

1836
02:50:44.76 --> 02:50:45.96
To feed their children.

1837
02:50:46.52 --> 02:50:49.24
They're going to feed their children poison.

1838
02:50:49.24 --> 02:50:49.80
Don't do that.

1839
02:50:49.80 --> 02:50:50.92
Get them some more of your kid milk.

1840
02:50:50.92 --> 02:50:52.44
By the way, they're super stoked.

1841
02:50:53.08 --> 02:50:58.28
Only product, this is the most unified product where the parents want it as much as the

1842
02:50:58.28 --> 02:50:58.92
kids.

1843
02:50:58.92 --> 02:51:01.88
The parents, the kids want it as much as the parents want them to have it.

1844
02:51:02.52 --> 02:51:04.76
Because your kids like, oh, I want my kid to be strong.

1845
02:51:04.76 --> 02:51:05.24
Yeah.

1846
02:51:05.24 --> 02:51:06.12
And healthy.

1847
02:51:06.12 --> 02:51:06.44
Cool.

1848
02:51:06.44 --> 02:51:08.52
And the kids like I want something that tastes awesome.

1849
02:51:08.52 --> 02:51:09.52
Cool.

1850
02:51:09.52 --> 02:51:13.08
You might be, you probably are kind of past this.

1851
02:51:13.08 --> 02:51:19.96
You've probably been out of this game for a while, but getting little kids to eat their dinner,

1852
02:51:19.96 --> 02:51:20.96
right?

1853
02:51:20.96 --> 02:51:21.96
Either whatever.

1854
02:51:21.96 --> 02:51:24.60
And then the kid being like a picky eater or whatever.

1855
02:51:24.60 --> 02:51:25.60
Right?

1856
02:51:25.60 --> 02:51:26.60
So that's like a challenge.

1857
02:51:26.60 --> 02:51:27.60
I'm a picky eater.

1858
02:51:27.60 --> 02:51:28.60
I'm a picky eater.

1859
02:51:28.60 --> 02:51:29.60
I'm still in that.

1860
02:51:29.60 --> 02:51:31.20
I'm still in that game for years.

1861
02:51:31.20 --> 02:51:32.60
But that can be a challenge with the kids.

1862
02:51:32.60 --> 02:51:34.40
You just want to get them fed into bed.

1863
02:51:34.40 --> 02:51:35.60
You don't starve your kids.

1864
02:51:35.60 --> 02:51:37.84
And then, you know, you're not going to force feed.

1865
02:51:37.84 --> 02:51:39.40
So it becomes a thing, right?

1866
02:51:39.40 --> 02:51:44.44
So sometimes the easy path is to be like, you know, let me just get them.

1867
02:51:44.44 --> 02:51:48.76
I'm going to get this food down on them and, you know, he's not starving or whatever.

1868
02:51:48.76 --> 02:51:49.76
She's not starving.

1869
02:51:49.76 --> 02:51:51.40
But here's the thing.

1870
02:51:51.40 --> 02:51:53.56
So in that battle, because that can be a battle.

1871
02:51:53.56 --> 02:51:56.92
I'm not saying for everybody, but that's a common battle that I hear about.

1872
02:51:56.92 --> 02:52:01.28
This is one of those just a small, one of those solutions.

1873
02:52:01.28 --> 02:52:03.28
Or it's like, yep, they're not going to protest.

1874
02:52:03.28 --> 02:52:04.52
They're going to love that one.

1875
02:52:04.52 --> 02:52:07.80
And then boom, they get their protein, they get their nutrients.

1876
02:52:07.80 --> 02:52:08.80
Perfect.

1877
02:52:08.80 --> 02:52:11.36

1883
02:52:27.04 --> 02:52:30.04
for nothing, but they're getting theirs.

1884
02:52:30.04 --> 02:52:32.60
Of course, I mean they're getting theirs.

1885
02:52:32.60 --> 02:52:35.88
So if you want to, if you want to do that, jockelfiel.com, subscribe to get free shipping.

Where?

1888
02:52:40.08 --> 02:52:41.08
Wallwaw.

1889
02:52:41.08 --> 02:52:42.08
What?

1890
02:52:42.08 --> 02:52:44.80
And the vitamin shop, you can get all the products at the vitamin shop.

1891
02:52:44.80 --> 02:52:46.08
So go check those out.

1892
02:52:46.08 --> 02:52:47.08
So there you go.

1893
02:52:47.08 --> 02:52:48.60
Also, origin, USA.

1894
02:52:48.60 --> 02:52:52.92
This is where you can get your American made jeans, boots, some wallets on there.

1895
02:52:52.92 --> 02:52:53.92
A bunch of good stuff.

1896
02:52:53.92 --> 02:52:54.92
Jiu Jitsu stuff, geese.

1897
02:52:54.92 --> 02:52:55.92
Now here's the thing.

1898
02:52:55.92 --> 02:53:02.56
They're not just like regular freaking generic-ish stuff.

1899
02:53:02.56 --> 02:53:04.56
You know, Neil Blackbelt, Neil.

1900
02:53:04.56 --> 02:53:08.68
Anyways, I was wrong with him.

1901
02:53:08.68 --> 02:53:12.88
And he trains MMA during the day.

1902
02:53:12.88 --> 02:53:16.56
It's probably why you don't know him because you don't train MMA during the day.

1903
02:53:16.56 --> 02:53:20.000
But he happened to throw geon the other day and we were rolling.

1904
02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.60
And he like grabbed my geek.

1905
02:53:22.60 --> 02:53:25.28
And then he was all like, hey, what is this?

1906
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:26.28
He started cursing me.

1907
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:27.28
He started cursing me.

1908
02:53:27.28 --> 02:53:28.88
He like stopped rolling to ask me about it.

1909
02:53:28.88 --> 02:53:29.88
I got it.

1910
02:53:29.88 --> 02:53:30.88
That bro.

1911
02:53:30.88 --> 02:53:32.56
This is the, this is called the Rift.

1912
02:53:32.56 --> 02:53:33.88
That makes complete sense to me.

1913
02:53:33.88 --> 02:53:35.68
And that's how all of it is, too, by the way.

1914
02:53:35.68 --> 02:53:39.12
So I have two pairs of Delta 68 jeans.

1915
02:53:39.12 --> 02:53:41.20
I have the factory jeans.

1916
02:53:41.20 --> 02:53:44.64
Even when you put those on, you're like, oh, there's a little bit more to these.

1917
02:53:44.64 --> 02:53:48.44
Just from us, like, a physical presence.

1918
02:53:48.44 --> 02:53:49.84
Presence standpoint.

1919
02:53:49.84 --> 02:53:50.84
Yes, sir.

1920
02:53:50.84 --> 02:53:57.08
So yes, they, you know, they're, the origin USA.com, so you can get this stuff.

1921
02:53:57.08 --> 02:54:00.76
But this, there's, okay, American made, yes, we'll get to that.

1922
02:54:00.76 --> 02:54:04.36
But a lot goes into this from the beginning to the end.

1923
02:54:04.36 --> 02:54:06.44
Yeah, when you put it on, you can tell.

1924
02:54:06.44 --> 02:54:08.28
And you can also tell it's made in America.

1925
02:54:08.28 --> 02:54:08.96
Yes, sir.

1926
02:54:08.96 --> 02:54:10.32
You can tell it's made in America.

1927
02:54:10.32 --> 02:54:18.52
When you see people bringing back machines from overseas, which we literally brought back

1928
02:54:18.52 --> 02:54:22.78
machines from overseas to start making stuff back here and make more stuff back in

1929
02:54:22.78 --> 02:54:23.78
America.

1930
02:54:23.78 --> 02:54:24.78
I mean, come on.

1931
02:54:24.78 --> 02:54:25.78
Are you serious right now?

1932
02:54:25.78 --> 02:54:26.78
Yeah, we're serious.

1933
02:54:26.78 --> 02:54:27.78
Why?

1934
02:54:27.78 --> 02:54:29.28
We want to, we want to help people.

1935
02:54:29.28 --> 02:54:31.16
We want to help our communities.

1936
02:54:31.16 --> 02:54:32.32
We want to help our country.

1937
02:54:32.32 --> 02:54:33.32
How do you do that?

1938
02:54:33.32 --> 02:54:36.16
Go get something for origin USA.com.

1939
02:54:36.16 --> 02:54:37.16
Help everybody.

1940
02:54:37.16 --> 02:54:40.16
You know, and be super comfortable.

1941
02:54:40.16 --> 02:54:41.16
Boy.

1942
02:54:41.16 --> 02:54:42.96
Yeah, it's good.

1943
02:54:42.96 --> 02:54:50.84
So I feel like, I feel like my wardrobe is essentially taking over by origin stuff.

1944
02:54:50.84 --> 02:54:51.84
Yeah.

1945
02:54:51.84 --> 02:54:57.44
I've literally seen one of my old favorite sweat or sweat or hoodies, whatever.

1946
02:54:57.44 --> 02:54:58.96
Literally sitting in front of me.

1947
02:54:58.96 --> 02:55:02.20
And I spent 30 minutes looking for the origin one.

1948
02:55:02.20 --> 02:55:03.20
There you go.

1949
02:55:03.20 --> 02:55:04.20
Yep.

1950
02:55:04.20 --> 02:55:05.20
You want that one?

1951
02:55:05.20 --> 02:55:06.20
Yep.

1952
02:55:06.20 --> 02:55:07.20
Pull it.

1953
02:55:07.20 --> 02:55:08.20
Or do you want to say it?

1954
02:55:08.20 --> 02:55:09.20
Also, chocolate store.

1955
02:55:09.20 --> 02:55:10.20
You're going to represent while you're on this path.

1956
02:55:10.20 --> 02:55:12.40
You want to represent discipline equals freedom.

1957
02:55:12.40 --> 02:55:15.80
You want to shirt a hat, a hoodie.

1958
02:55:15.80 --> 02:55:16.80
So you can get it.

1959
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:18.68
So yes, jokester.com.

1960
02:55:18.68 --> 02:55:20.64
There's some new stuff on there.

1961
02:55:20.64 --> 02:55:22.20
There's always new stuff on there.

1962
02:55:22.20 --> 02:55:23.68
The GJ2 section.

1963
02:55:23.68 --> 02:55:25.20
The GJ2 section is coming along.

1964
02:55:25.20 --> 02:55:26.68
How many shirts are in the GJ2 section?

1965
02:55:26.68 --> 02:55:28.68
We have a new one there.

1966
02:55:28.68 --> 02:55:29.68
I don't know.

1967
02:55:29.68 --> 02:55:30.68
Yeah.

1968
02:55:30.68 --> 02:55:31.68
That's actually it.

1969
02:55:31.68 --> 02:55:34.68
Well, we're completely, we're what he calls their intransit to be on.

1970
02:55:34.68 --> 02:55:38.68
By the time this comes out, tomorrow might be on there.

1971
02:55:38.68 --> 02:55:39.68
Maybe even not, I don't know.

1972
02:55:39.68 --> 02:55:42.12
Either way, always new stuff on there.

1973
02:55:42.12 --> 02:55:43.12
New stuff.

1974
02:55:43.12 --> 02:55:45.12
Speaking of new stuff, shirt locker.

1975
02:55:45.12 --> 02:55:46.52
New shirt every month.

1976
02:55:46.52 --> 02:55:47.52
It's a subscription scenario.

1977
02:55:47.52 --> 02:55:50.40
Are you going to new shirt every month if you don't know about this?

1978
02:55:50.40 --> 02:55:53.36
It, the designs are a little bit different, but they're very appropriate.

1979
02:55:53.36 --> 02:55:54.36
Very appropriate.

1980
02:55:54.36 --> 02:55:56.16
How you finally found what are you going to say?

1981
02:55:56.16 --> 02:55:57.96
You used to say like, well, they're kind of it.

1982
02:55:57.96 --> 02:55:58.96
Now you're saying appropriate.

1983
02:55:58.96 --> 02:55:59.96
I like it.

1984
02:55:59.96 --> 02:56:00.96
A appropriate space to be.

1985
02:56:00.96 --> 02:56:02.96
Because that is the most accurate as of right now.

1986
02:56:02.96 --> 02:56:04.96
I would agree with you.

1987
02:56:04.96 --> 02:56:05.96
They are appropriate.

1988
02:56:05.96 --> 02:56:06.96
All of them.

1989
02:56:06.96 --> 02:56:07.96
Did you see that?

1990
02:56:07.96 --> 02:56:08.96
No, that you didn't see.

1991
02:56:08.96 --> 02:56:11.96
There's the February one, which is, it's not February.

1992
02:56:11.96 --> 02:56:12.96
Yeah.

1993
02:56:12.96 --> 02:56:13.96
So you got to wait for that.

1994
02:56:13.96 --> 02:56:14.96
I think you might.

1995
02:56:14.96 --> 02:56:16.96
You might appreciate that.

1996
02:56:16.96 --> 02:56:17.96
Okay.

1997
02:56:17.96 --> 02:56:18.96
Check out.

1998
02:56:18.96 --> 02:56:21.96
Speaking of subscription, subscribe to this podcast wherever you subscribe to podcast.

1999
02:56:21.96 --> 02:56:25.48
Leave a review so that I can make fun of Eccled Charles for what you say about

2000
02:56:25.48 --> 02:56:26.48
him.

2001
02:56:26.48 --> 02:56:27.48
Sure.

2002
02:56:27.48 --> 02:56:32.12
We also have the unraveling podcast with Dery Cooper, grounded podcast, which themes

2003
02:56:32.12 --> 02:56:35.48
been hit me up once again, to the grounded game.

2004
02:56:35.48 --> 02:56:40.44
So probably make that happen where your kid podcast you.

2005
02:56:40.44 --> 02:56:44.04
You can also join us on the underground, joc on the ground.com.

2006
02:56:44.04 --> 02:56:51.92
Look, where we are we, are we nervous about people getting canceled and banned and all

2007
02:56:51.92 --> 02:56:52.92
this other stuff?

2008
02:56:52.92 --> 02:56:53.92
I'm not nervous.

2009
02:56:53.92 --> 02:56:56.64
I don't stay up at night thinking about it.

2010
02:56:56.64 --> 02:56:59.24
But is it smart to just sit around and not pay attention?

2011
02:56:59.24 --> 02:57:00.24
No, it's not.

2012
02:57:00.24 --> 02:57:08.64
You can see people literally getting removed from platforms right now.

2013
02:57:08.64 --> 02:57:16.60
They removed Joe Rogan had a guest on who's a Harvard doctor.

2014
02:57:16.60 --> 02:57:18.16
And they didn't like what he said.

2015
02:57:18.16 --> 02:57:21.64
They removed it from YouTube, which is, which seems kind of crazy, right?

2016
02:57:21.64 --> 02:57:22.64
Yeah.

2017
02:57:22.64 --> 02:57:23.64
Very.

2018
02:57:23.64 --> 02:57:28.56
So what is he saying that needs to be removed so no one can hear it?

2019
02:57:28.56 --> 02:57:33.56
A Harvard medical doctor.

2020
02:57:33.56 --> 02:57:35.16
And it's just a little clip.

2021
02:57:35.16 --> 02:57:36.36
You know, a little clip?

2022
02:57:36.36 --> 02:57:39.16
Oh, we're going to remove that.

2023
02:57:39.16 --> 02:57:42.04
So look, am I staying awake?

2024
02:57:42.04 --> 02:57:43.96
Not staying awake, but am I paying attention?

2025
02:57:43.96 --> 02:57:44.96
Yes, I am.

2026
02:57:44.96 --> 02:57:45.96
Do we need to have a contingency plan?

2027
02:57:45.96 --> 02:57:47.76
Yes, we do.

2028
02:57:47.76 --> 02:57:48.76
contingency plan.

2029
02:57:48.76 --> 02:57:56.72
Joc on around dot com.

2030
02:57:56.72 --> 02:58:00.92
You subscribe because $8.18 a month, then if anything ever happens to the platform,

2031
02:58:00.92 --> 02:58:03.32
we'll be there.

2032
02:58:03.32 --> 02:58:04.32
We'll be there.

2033
02:58:04.32 --> 02:58:05.68
We'll do what we've got to do.

2034
02:58:05.68 --> 02:58:07.40
I don't think it's going to happen.

2035
02:58:07.40 --> 02:58:09.40
But that way we don't have to take on a bunch of sponsors that say,

2036
02:58:09.40 --> 02:58:11.16
who could talk about that?

2037
02:58:11.16 --> 02:58:12.56
We don't want you to talk about that.

I am at Jockel Willink.

2152

And thanks to all the military members in uniform right now,

2153
03:02:51.40 --> 03:02:54.04
doing what needs to be done to protect our freedom

2154
03:02:54.04 --> 03:02:56.68
and our way of life.

2155
03:02:56.68 --> 03:02:59.32
The same goes to police law enforcement,

2156
03:02:59.32 --> 03:03:01.56

2157
03:03:01.56 --> 03:03:04.000

03:03:05.76 --> 03:03:09.04
Thank you for protecting our way of life here at home.

2160

And everyone else out there.

2161
03:03:11.28 --> 03:03:16.04
Remember to make yourself as capable as possible,

2162
03:03:16.04 --> 03:03:25.04
strong, fast, smart, and then remember that there are people

2163
03:03:25.04 --> 03:03:28.04
who are not as capable as you are.

2164
03:03:28.04 --> 03:03:31.04
Not because they're lazy or lax today is a good or lack worth

2165
03:03:31.04 --> 03:03:35.04
at work ethic, but they simply do not have the capacity.

2166
03:03:35.04 --> 03:03:40.04
And then do your best to help those people out,

2167
03:03:40.04 --> 03:03:44.04
which is part of being a good person,

2168
03:03:44.04 --> 03:03:49.04
and will make their world, and thereby our world

2169
03:03:49.04 --> 03:03:52.04
just a little bit better.

2170
03:03:52.04 --> 03:03:54.04
Thanks for listening.

2171
03:03:54.04 --> 03:03:55.04
And until next time,

2172
03:03:55.04 --> 03:03:57.04
this is Echo and Jockel.

Bye.
