oh you can strong point of building too long and that was something we'd see all the time in training was we'd we'd be attacking guys in an urban environment they would do the right thing in strong point of building and if they got bogged down in that building then they would get surrounded and they get picked off and they'd get slaughtered if they strong pointed that building they made a quick rapid plan on how they were going to break out of there they would do fine so they had to find that they had to find that balance the second way to pursue an advantage is through exploitation an offensive tactic that is designed to disorganize enemy in depth exploitation usually follows a successful attack that is created or exposed some enemy vulnerability for example an attack that is torn a gap in enemy defenses allows us to attack vital enemy areas the object of exploitation is not to destroy the combat forces directly opposing us even though they may be weakened instead the object is to disrupt the entire enemy system by attacking important activities and functions it's real easy to get distracted into the little tactical battle that you could win as opposed to looking at what's going on strategically and how you can attack you how you can disrupt the entire enemy system in desert storm there was I'm sure most people have heard of there's something called the highway of death and there was this string of enemy armored vehicles that went for miles and miles and miles up into into Iraq at a quay and that started and I don't know 100% of the story but it started with this formation of a fighter attack aircraft that under most circumstances you would hit that lead element that's the tactical smart thing to do it, presumption of the most amount of fuel it's the best for your weapons and they actually bypassed that lead formation and went all the way to the tail end of the formation so rather than just disrupt that where the point of attack was that that lead element where our forces had met their forces and they actually bypass that and went all the way to the tail end of that enemy formation and devastated that tail end and blocked the road and that allowed for the next 30 hours wave and wave and wave of aircraft to then pick off every other vehicle that had no place to maneuver by bypassing what seemed to be the most obvious answer which is that first line which they recognize this is our opportunity to shut this whole system down and that was the genesis of that is recognizing this is the area we need to explain and we're actually going to take it we're going to skip the tactical answer here and go all the way to the end of this formation and that created a route that the enemy couldn't recover from because they had nowhere to go because those guys saw the opportunity to do that at the very beginning of that campaign where is mostly I think you go to hit hit first element come back do it again and that gives them all that time to to to to recalibrate and do something different Continuing small unit training should focus on proficiency in such techniques and procedures as immediate action drills battle drills and unit standard operating procedures practicing to reach technical proficiency applies to all types of units whether a section of aircraft executing air combat maneuvers a maintenance contact team repairing a vehicle under fire and artillery gun team conducting displace materials or rifle squad conducting an in-stripe beach breach of an obstacle we develop and refine these measured measures so that units gain and maintain the speed and accuracy essential for success in battle staffs like units and individual leaders must train to increase speed and accuracy staffs increase speed by accomplishing three things first by obtaining and organizing information to help the commander and themselves understand the situation boy this is like every this should be printed on the walls of every staff organization in the US military second by understanding the commander's decision and core decision and coordinating efforts to focus combat power to achieve the commander's goal and third by monitoring events maintaining situational awareness and anticipating and and and and adapt and adapting to changes as staffs train they increase accuracy by becoming more proficient both in their respective areas and in functioning as a team that's what the staffs are trying to do and notice that if you're in a staff you better know what the commander's goal is you better understand what that intent is if you don't understand what that intent is if you don't understand that goal is you are completely lost and if you're commander and there's any doubt in your military mind what's so ever that your staff doesn't know what your intent is and what your goal is you better make it crystal clear field marshal Irwin Ramwell Ramwell knew the value of speed and accuracy for his staff when he wrote a commander must accustomed his staff to a high tempo from the outset and continuously keep them up to it if he wants allows himself to be satisfied with norms or anything less than an all-out effort he gives up the race from the starting post and will sooner or later be taught a bitter lesson allow yourself to be satisfied with the norms allowing anything less than an all-out effort you give up the race from the starting post that's what I'm talking about now can we burn people out absolutely yes can we burn ourselves out absolutely so you what you have to know what you have to learn and what you have to understand is you have to understand and learn when you're going to conserve energy and when you're going to go on the attack you know that's that's wrong talking and that sounds cool but trust me and I've seen it and we and I know you've seen it in the military plenty of commanders that they lose touch with their people and they just burn them out and they have horrible command climates and more important they're they become ineffective at executing their mission oh 56 years old 56 years old demanded that he be allowed to lead his man into that situation and and he was not he was not like a strong healthy 56 years old you want to know why he wasn't strong and healthy at the age of 56 because he was still having problems health major health problems from the wounds that he suffered in world war one so there you go there's the quotes these are quotes we listen to and going to the book reading and understanding the ideas in this publication are the initial steps on the road to tactical accident excellence reading and understanding boy they throw those words out they're really easy don't they reading and understanding as if it's like if you read you understand that is not true reading and understanding have almost nothing to do with each other reading and understanding that should be capitalized and italicized and in a different font reading and understanding the ideas in this publication are the initial steps such as the initial steps on the road to tactical accidents excellence the primary way a marine leader becomes an able tactician is through training and education both of which are firmly rooted in doctrine doctrine establishes the philosophy and the practical framework for how we fight education develops the understanding creativity military judgment and the background essential for effective battlefield leadership there is a lot to learn training follows doctrine and develops the tactical and technical proficiency that underlies all successful military action individual and group exercises serve to integrate training in education producing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts the lessons learned from training and operational experience then modify doctrine doctrine next section doctrine establishes the fundamental beliefs of the Marine Corps on the subject of war and how we practice our profession doctrine establishes a particular way of thinking about war and our way of fighting a philosophy for leading Marines in combat a mandate for professionalism and a common language that is important this one of the things when we work with companies the common language part these companies know that they're making mistakes they don't know how do I properly identify what their mistakes are or what their issues are until we come in and then they said oh we're gonna pull back fine no factor no factor one works the other does not work here it this ability to finish the enemy once and for all derives from first from possessing an aggressive mentality second it stems from an understanding of the commanders intent third it stems from a keen situational awareness that helps recognize opportunities when they present themselves and understand when the conditions are right for action so again it's not 100% of the time it's when the conditions are right for action so those those are the three things first aggressive mentality second understanding the commanders intent third situational awareness so you understand if the actions are right next section use of the reserve in combat the reserve is an important tool for exploiting success the reserve is part of the commanders combat power initially withheld from action in order to influence future action the reason to create a maintain a reserve is to provide flexibility to deal with the uncertainty chance and disorder of war the reserve is thus a valuable tool for maintaining adaptability in general the more uncertain the situation the larger should be in reserve Napoleon once said that war is composed of nothing but accidents and a general should never lose sight of any everything to enable him to profit from those accidents these accidents take the form of opportunities and crisis and crises the reserve is a key tactical tool for dealing with both the commander should have a purpose in mind for reserve employment and design it to fulfill that purpose to truly exploit success may warrant a assignment of the commander's best subordinate unit or a preponderance of combat power or mobility assets to the reserve so sometimes you're you're reserved should be your strongest and most powerful element whether it's the best or whether it's the the one with the most combat power those commanders who properly organized task and equipped their reserves are usually the ones with the capability to finish the enemy when the opportunity arises when central recognized the value of a reserve when he wrote it is in the use and withholding of their reserves that great commanders have generally excelled after all when once the last reserve has been thrown in commanders the commander's part is played the event must be left to pluck and to the fighting troops and pluck as I can hold term for courage basically once you've put committed reserve you're you're done you made your move but then they're saying but whereas the cost of moral courage may be loss of friends popularity prestige and this is the more I find most interesting or career opportunities so what they are saying right there I mean obviously if my boss wants me to make a certain correct moral decision he's going to promote me but what they're saying in that statement right there that there are times when you will be making decisions that are morally correct that will actually hurt your career that's the statement or you will be at risk of hurting your career I can think of a thousand examples of this right off the top of my head from being in seal potions you know because you you want what happens to leaders sometimes in a seal platoon is they don't want it they're insecure about their leadership and there's something going on that they don't feel comfortable about but they don't have the moral courage to say anything and part of that is because hey they they say oh this is this shouldn't be happening and as soon as they say that they're drawn the spotlight on themselves and they're not really sure about themselves and all of a sudden they feel like if their boss is going to look at them like they don't know how to lead their men and now I'm not going to get promoted like that whole thing on once you know life just so we can survive the cold we're actually going to use it to destroy our enemies you talked about a little bit earlier about leaders that will just they'll lose side of what they're trying to do and and what they'll do they'll just push really hard and it's not that they're pushing harder than their other counterparts it's that they don't understand when and why they're pushing hard they don't know when they should build up the reserves and when they're so they just go hard because they know going hard we should go hard and it isn't that they're going harder and they burn them out it's that there's no connection to why they're going hard to what they're actually going to try to accomplish in that training and that disconnect of why they're doing what they're doing versus what they're doing and I've been in units where the leader just we just go hard and a lot of people are like what the hell are we doing and nobody knows and those units will fall apart before they actually exceed their physical capacity to do things or as other units can actually you can actually go harder if they understand why so that thing you really want to do if you can make the connection to the reason they're doing it you can go as hard as you want and it's not that going hard that burns the units out it's having no idea why they're going hard or when they should go hard those are the units that burn out here's where you can run into a problem with this attitude of rommels of hey and this is how they close out this little section a leader's self confidence is the well spring from which flows the willingness to assume responsibility and exercise initiative so every moment that you are cutting down a leader's confidence you are crushing their their willingness to assume responsibility take ownership and exercise initiative this is what you need them to do what you absolutely need them to do crazy and here's the conclusion in this publication we have explored themes that help us to understand the fundamentals and to master the art and science of tactics from the study of our war fighting philosophy we have gained an appreciation for their requirement to be decisive in battle to accomplish this we must clearly visualize the battle space gained through gained situational awareness recognize patterns and make decisions intuitively we have also discussed ways we can gain advantage over the enemy and force him to bend to our will we also explored how to be faster in relation to the enemy to adapt to changing conditions to cooperate for success to exploit success and to finish the enemy finally we discussed how we can begin to act on these ideas during our training for combat the ideas presented in this publication have implications far beyond a battle field tactics and the doctrinal way we think about warfare they also influence the way we organize using task organization and flexible command and control relationships and the way we equip ourselves for combat weging war in maneuver warfare styled demands a professional body of officers and marines schooled in its science and art when asked why the marines were so successful in operation desert storm general boomer replied the thing that made the big difference on the battle field is that we had thousands and thousands of individual marines constantly taking the initiative the young Lance Corporal would take a look see something 75 or 100 meters out in front that needed to be done and go out there and do it without being told as I read through the award citations from desert shield and desert storm this team reappears time and time again that aggressive spirit comes from being well trained and confident in your professional knowledge and here's how they close this thing out everything we do in peace time should prepare us for combat our preparation for combat depends upon training and education that develop the action and fought essential to battle and that wraps up MCDP one tack three tactics everything we do in peace time should prepare us for combat everything and let's just take that one step further that everything that you do matters it matters yeah back to the book exercise is also test the ability of units to sustain tempo for an extended period of time since victory is rarely the product of single actions the ability to operate and sustain combat effectiveness over time is important knowing when hostilities will cease is a convenience denied the combat Marine equipment must be maintained and people must be sustained with adequate rest, nourishment and hygiene until they accomplish their mission tactical exercises can range from field exercises to command post exercises to tactical exercises without field troops field exercises conducted by units of any size involved involve all unit personnel working together to learn test and refine their collective battlefield skills such exercises can be general in nature or they can be detailed rehearsals for specific upcoming missions command post exercises are largely limited to commanders and their staff their purposes to familiarize the staff with their commanders personnel personal preferences and operating styles as well as to exercise staff techniques and procedures to review a particular to review particular contingency plans so for those of you don't in the military sometimes the leadership the staff can rehearse and practice and do exercises as if there's a there's a there's a there move out of the field or working and even other not tactical exercises without troops provide tactical leaders opportunities to exercise judgment while permitting other unit elements to conduct training and education on their own there are there are two approaches to conducting them the first method provides a leader an opportunity to evaluate a subordinate's ability to perform in a given scenario boom scenario based training role playing you don't need anybody you don't need anybody in the field you can make it happen this method provides places students in an area of operations and provides a situation upon which to plan an executed task for example established a reverse slope defense the aim here is to exercise tactical proficiency in the sighting of weapons in the use of terrain the second method also places the student in an air operations and provides a situation but gives them a mission or a mission order for example prevent enemy movement north of route 348 the aim here is to exercise judgment after walking the ground the students must first decide whether to defend or it's exporting their conclusions with reasoning the reasoning is then discussed and criticized this approach encourages students to demonstrate ingenuity and initiative they have free reign to employ the resources as they see fit to achieve the desired results so just putting people in scenarios and then most equally important is discussing and criticizing and asking people why they're doing what they're doing why they made that decision figuring out how they're thinking and why they're thinking and then I was willing to be criticized I wasn't defensive about being criticized I was actually listening to their point of view as well it's not that hard it's just a little humility from leaders to go well would you see man why that's pretty good I didn't see it like that this conversation isn't that hard and they're free they're free next section war gaming war games can be a valuable tool for understanding the many factors that influence a leader's decisions morale enemy and friendly situations the higher commanders intentions firepower mobility and terrain are only a few of the decision factors included in the play of war games in all these simulations from the sand table to a commercial board game to a computerized simulation routine should be avoided the less familiar the environment the more creativity the student must display sand table exercises tactical decision games and map exercises present students with a general situation mission orders and a minimum of information on enemy and friendly forces sand table exercises are especially suited to novice tacticians they present the terrain and a three-durched dimensional array whereas a map requires interpretation both map and sand table exercises and able students to conceptualize the battle deliver their decisions and issue orders to subordinates afterwards students discuss their decisions and our critique the decision the discussion should focus on making a decision in the absence of perfect information or complete intelligence those are again these are things that are free free you can do with your business you can do with your team you can do with your platoon next section terrain walks terrain walks introduce the realities of terrain vegetation and weather terrain walks can be conducted in at least two ways the first method provides students with an area of operations a general situation and a mission as in sand table and map exercises students describe their view of the battle choosing one plan the group then begins to walk the terrain according to the plan the group will then encounter to un-inticipate terrain and obstacles while the instructors introduce enemy actions into the play of the problem in this way students must contend with the disparity between actual terrain and vegetarian vegetation and maps as well as the chaos and uncertainty generated by enemy actions that invariably occur in real world operations to just think of all the ways you as a business owner can employ that right there playing the bad customer playing the good customer well when you train you're going to make adaptations you're going to make assessments you're going to make adjustments then when you deploy an employee you're going to do the same thing you're going to assess where you're out what worked what didn't you're going to make adaptations then you're going to put that in the doctrine with a doctrine you're going to take that and educate people and you're going to continually assess and adapt and adjust what you're what you're teaching and what you're training on next section education while combat provides the most instructive lessons on decision-making that's an understanding of the year well combat provides the most instructive lessons on decision-making tactical leaders cannot wait for war to begin their education we must be competent in our profession before our skills are called upon the lives of our Marines depend on it our education and tactics must develop three qualities within all tactical leaders the first quality is creative ability tactical leaders must be encouraged to devise and pursue unique approaches to military problems no rules govern ingenuity see now this is not what people expect we did the disset we did we did the chapter on discipline and this seems to be completely counter to that that's why there's a dichotomy here but the number one quality to develop is creative ability and there's no rules that govern ingenuity the line separating boldness boldness from fool hardiness is drawn by the hand of practical experience that said an education in tactics must possess an element of rigor to often tactical discussions lack an in-depth analysis of cause and effect the tactically proficient leader must learn how to analyze solutions to tactical problems lacking such a rigorous analysis the tactician will not learn from experience nor exercise creative ability this applies to everything by the way it applies to everything anything that you're trying to learn you and I don't I don't know too much about that scenario from the air perspective but from the ground perspective you would think well the lead element is the one that you're most worried about they're the ones that are closest to friendly forces we need to go and eliminate them first and we'll go from there so to sort of bypass that is a a pretty bold decision to make continue on for example during operation desert storm in 1991 the armies tiger brigade was deployed by the second marine division as an exploitation force during the divisions final attack the brigade had the advantage over the Iraqis in speed fire power and night combat capabilities with these advantages the tiger brigade sliced deep into the rear of the Iraqi three core and sealed off the vital highway intersections north of al jara the result was total disruption in the Iraqi organized defense the third way to exploit advantages through pursuit a pursuit is an offensive tactic designed to cut off or catch a hostile force that has lost cohesion and is attempting to escape in order to destroy it if the intent is to bring about the final destruction or capture of the enemy forces then pursuit should be pushed with utmost vigor it is here that operations turn into routes and overwhelming victories often occur general grants pursuit of general ease Confederate army of northern Virginia from Peter's board from Peter'sburg to apomatix in April 1965 is a classic example of pursuit here grant pushed his forces to their limits in order to prevent leaves escape this ultimately led to the capture and surrender of these forces the Confederate armies lieutenant general Thomas J stone wall jackson summed up pursuit when he said strike the enemy and overcome him never give up the pursuit as long as your men have the strength to follow for an enemy routed if hotly pursued becomes panic-stricken and can be destroyed by half their number so you once you got them on the run run them down finishing the enemy ultimately we want to cultivate opportunities into a decisive advantage once we do we make the most of it marine cortex call for leaders who are strong finishers we must have a strong desire to go for the jugular I'm so thankful they put that in there because that's you know usually that's sort of like a like a ruffian comment to make right and then they come out of that you know if you don't maintain reserve the opportunity is there you can't exploit it same thing with your leadership capital right same thing with you as a leader if you sit there and you expend all your leadership reserve all your leadership capital you don't leave any reserve you have no more for lack of a better word you have no more favors to ask as a leader should you be asking favors you are asking for favors that's what every time you ask a subordinate do something you're asking for a favor that's what you're asking you're asking them to put their trust in you to do this thing that you want that's a favor and if you expend all your leadership capital you have no more favors to ask when the time is needed and you've expended those reserves you're not going to be followed anymore that's why relationships are so critical to all this I mean that's how you build up your that's your leadership reserve that's your capital that's your reserve force is how strong those relationships are so when the time is right you can cash in on that not that you cash in on them and and use them as some sort of expendable resources that you actually leverage that relationship and that recognition that you need to build that now you don't know when you're going to need it and when you're in a battle in a battle you've got one reserve and it is that energy the energy sometimes we must employ the reserve to deal with some crisis rendering it temporarily unavailable for commitment elsewhere in such instances a reserve should be reconstitute and is rapidly as possible so sometimes you got a scramble and move and use some energy and then as soon as you get to a good position or as as we should look for the opportunity to employ the reserve to reinforce success however we may employ the reserve however we employ we may employ the reserve we should always think of it as the tool for clinching victory that's also why you see a guy gets us gets a submission thinks let me revise that a guy thinks he gets a submission and expands all of his energy trying to clinch the victory expands all of his reserves you see this in MMA a lot too one of his spends all of his reserves has nothing left the person gets out of the the possible submission and the game is now the tides turn into this respect marshal foc who is a French general he was actually the supreme allied commander in world war one leading troops to victory at the mar in which I don't know man like every time I read like the background of a jen roller if someone is getting quoted I'm always like whatever okay or you put it alive throughout there and guys like I'm not gonna I don't want to get killed there you go make it realistic free play exercises are adaptable to all tactical scenarios and benefit beneficial to all echelons whether it is fire teams scouting against fire teams sections of aircraft dueling in the sky do you get a little bit he like that don't you or battalions or companies battalions squadrons and marine airground task force operating against one another both leaders and individual marines benefit leaders form and execute their decisions against an opposing force as individual marines employ their skills against an active enemy through free play exercises marines learn to fight as an organization and deal with a realistically challenging foe next section is about critiques a key attribute of decision makers is their ability to reach decisions with clear reasoning critiques elicit this reasoning critiques elicit this reasoning process any tactical decision game or tactical exercise should culminate with a critique the standard approach for conducting critiques should be should promote initiative since every tactical situation is unique and since no training situation can encompass more than a small fraction of the peculiarities of a real tactical situation there can be no ideal school solution critiques should focus on the students rationale for for doing what they did so there is he it's like you said i'm not gonna say Dave you chose this method that method was wrong but they got a lot of good stuff on their rings as well that's that one that one's a key if you don't have rings get rings hundred percent definitely on it dot com the books I have for you warrior kid three warrior kid two warrior kid one these are the books that will get your kids on the path man like you know how we're reading this the whole time Dave and we're like man I wish I would have read this like type of thing when I was twenty well when you were nine you wish you had the warrior kid books I guarantee it and you know what if you didn't have when you were nine you're gonna wish you had them when you were thirty eight true star hundred somebody somebody asked me in an interview the other day what does it mean to be a man right keep fair enough question it's another way to explain the exact same thing knowing that the people working with you some will understand it when they see it this way some will understand it when they see it that that way and the more different ways you can explain it the quicker they learn to see it in all of the places that actually will help it really sink in I don't care who you are me included none of it sinks in the first time and even when it does sink in it's not the whole thing and to take this one step further so Jimmy Page my favorite I guess my favorite example of this is Jimmy Page the guitarist from Led Zeppelin arguably the the greatest rock and roll guitarist of all time who is incredibly beyond comprehension creative with that instrument the guitar the guitar the get box he was so creative but he was a studio musician for many many years and he was one of the best studio musicians in London which is no no small feet because London is a music town so he had this and when you're a studio musician you play the notes that they tell you to play then you play them how you how they're written on the page that is 100% discipline follow orders you do what you're told and then guess what once you have that those standard operating procedures down then you can take them and you you can get creative and you see the patterns where you know what else sees them so the same thing the same exact thing happens with the laws of combat the better you know them the better you can take and you can get creative you can creatively apply them to problems and and they overlay properly on those problems because you understand how to use them better Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia nine tenths of tactics are certain right well the irrational tenth there's a tenth of tactics that are irrational this is where you because this is why if you can't tap into that creativity if you can't train that creativity in your brain that's why you're not going to be successful well as you say you're not going to be eminently successful you'll be somewhat successful you'll be reliable and that's admirable it's good to be reliable but if you want to go next level you need to be able to be a little bit irrational at times to be able to handle their rational and the next quote is it cannot be too often repeated that in modern war and especially in modern naval war the chief factor in achieving triumph is what has been done in the way of thorough preparation and training before the beginning of the war which is which is what you were talking about Dave like why are you in that position and that's by by the way that's Teddy Roosevelt theodore Roosevelt president theodore Roosevelt rough writer theater Roosevelt metal of honor recipient theater Roosevelt who by the way his son Teddy Roosevelt junior metal of honor recipient d day you know old okay you know like this is maybe this this match or this this training whatever is heating up so let me maintain the reserves right now you know kind of thing you still use your technique yeah for sure when the guy is bringing it it's kind of like dang you got to fight his energy with your energy you're like and when you commit the reserve that can be the decisive moment back to the book a strong reserve is also way to retain the initiative if an advanced slows the reserve can increase moment if an advanced picks up speed the commitment of the reserve then can can then create around we may use the reserve to expand or exploit gaps or penetrations we may commit the reserve to attack in a different location thus exploiting opportunities for success instead of reinforcing failure without a strong reserve even the most promising opportunities can be lost a classic example of the use of reserve is the battle for tarua with the second and eighth marine regiments held up on the assault beaches general julian smith decided to land the sixth marine regiment the does the division reserve to break the stalemate the first battalion six marines which was task organized as part of the division reserve landed on the western end of the island passed through the third battalion second marines and from the flank conducted a swift and violent assault of the Japanese fortifications across the island within 48 hours the Japanese forces were annihilated and the island secured when you're training the gjitsu what you know what you consider what do you consider your reserve echo when you're training your jjitsu what do you mean energy reserve or what's an admin constraint like what like like like like like this game does indicate that it's a game in their mind so you might have let's say we have a let's say this we're going to a an urban terrain village and the army says hey this one building we got over here the it's unsafe and so we're doing new autonapulups and if you're not good at pull ups PT sucks for you and by the way I didn't tell you when we were going to stop it and tell you how many were doing I'm so good doing pull ups you should be happy because I'm happy and so you miss you miss calculate how much the guys can actually take and there's a decent chance that they can't take as much as you because they're not leading it that's why when you put subordinate leaders in charge it allows you to more closely and accurately judge how much they can actually take and by the way they'll push harder if they're running it that's a thing that'll actually go harder they'll give you more if you let them run with it if you think you're going to lead from the front and and whip them to keep up with you you're wrong you will not get the same mileage out of them as you will if you say hey you take this and run with it so be careful they're young first lieutenant ramo out there back to the book likewise training should enable us to take appropriate action in any environment and at any time this readiness includes operating during inclement weather and periods of limited visibility we must make terrain weather and darkness our allies if we are to gain advantage and deliver decisive force at a time in place of our choosing we can neither anticipate nor appreciate the inherent friction that these natural factors produce unless we experience them. so we can move we're not going to move shoot and communicate we're in a shoot move and communicate that's what we say in the teams I'm pretty sure that's what the Marine Corps means as well we achieve technical competence through training we build skills through repetition training also instills confidence in weapons and equipment it develops the specialized skills essential to functioning in combat one of the ultimate aims of training is speed essential to speed is the requirement for accuracy speed without accuracy may be counterproductive and causes more damage than an then in action whether Marines compute firing data practice rifle marksmanship or weapons gunnery rearm and refuel aircraft repair vehicles stock or transport supplies or communicate information the speed and accuracy of their actions determine the tempo of the overall force training develops the proficiency which enables this effective combination of speed and accuracy all the things you're talking about here this is this is really the first time this tactics gets into tactical components of the things these individual Marines are supposed to do but something this that was mentioned earlier that that set the stage on this was what this pulls from the first doctrinal pub in the Marine Corps is pub one one tack one is called warfighting and that is the unifying thing that ties every Marine together is the understanding that you and it's really all the things you've just been talking about you are here as a war fighter first of all why would you do anything why would you expand any energy or take any action to do anything that could potentially undermine your ability to do that whether it's get drunk on a Friday night because it's it's what the dudes are doing what the bros are doing to do anything they would undermine
