 This is jockel podcast number 260 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening. I go good evening So I was in my bedroom Sitting on my bed and I was Renching in pain or I guess the proper word is anguish it had been two days Since Seth died And the the five stages of grief were not kind to me The first stage of grief denial was over in about 15 seconds I've had so many friends die that I know without question what it means I know how quickly it comes And I know that my friends in our line of work including Seth We dance with death all the time And just a day prior one of my friends and mentors in the seal teams master chief Mike faculty had died And all this was taking place right on the 11th anniversary of Mikey Montsoura being killed in action in Ramadi on September 29th 2006. So denial didn't last long and Neither did the the so called bargaining stage because I know there's no There's no bargaining with death I know what it is. I know it is irreversible irrevocable and I know it's 100% final which brought me to the next two stages which hit me at the same time part Working together in unison to torment me anger and depression So that's what I'm feeling sitting there in agony and the walls are closing in and the darkness is taking over my brain and I can actually see it happening I was talking about being detached so I'm I'm detached and I can see it happening and doesn't feel like there's anything I could do about it I see I see hope and I see the the fun and the joy and the laughter and I see life circling the drain and I know it's bad and I know I know where that leads I know that that's the beginning of the downward spiral Then I can feel my mind getting sucked into that vortex and I don't know what to do and from my bed you can see through the door to my office and I look into my office and I see a book and it's a book that I actually wrote the book that hadn't even been released yet it was about to be released but I had received my box of copies from the publisher and there was a stack of those books sitting on my desk and I I remembered that's like my own book was talking to me because I remembered that I had written about death in that book and when I had written about death I had written it for other people because I experienced a lot of loss, lost a lot of friends so I was writing about death so other people could learn from me because I felt like I was good and I knew how to handle death except at that moment in time I wasn't handling it too well at all so I picked up the book I picked up the book that I had written I picked up the book and opened it to a section to read the words that I had written myself and I read it the section is called death and it says how does good apply to the worst of losses the death of a loved one it's easy to think that there's nothing good in death but then I remember that people I have lost throughout my life the memories of them, the experiences, the fun, their unique personalities and everything they gave me not only in their life but in their death what their life taught me and what their death taught me the mark they had left on me and I realized there is good even in death there is good first of all I was lucky enough to have had that person in my life even if it was only for a short time two short of time at least I got that those moments, those precious moments, those unforgettable memories at least I got those and got to experience those times to know the beauty of their personality, their attitude, their outlook on the world they were all unique and I am thankful for the opportunity I had to interact with them now comes death, death is horrible and death is wretched and death is cruel and death isn't fair and I don't know why the best people seem to be taken from us first death is also inescapable there is no way out no one gets out alive death is part of life like the contrast between the darkness and the light without death there is no life and the people that I have lost they taught me that they taught me how precious life is, how blessed we are to have every day to learn, to grow, to laugh, to live to live, to live every day with purpose and passion to wake up in the morning and be thankful thankful for that morning, thankful for that opportunity to go into the world and live live for them, for those that don't have the opportunity, for those who are stolen away by death's cruel hand for them I will live, I will revere their memory and I will live live let us cry no more let us mourn no more let us remember but let us not dwell instead let us laugh and love and let us embrace and venerate everything that life is and every opportunity it gives us let us live for those who live no more let us live 200 them and that is what I tried to do then that is what I am still trying to do but I needed that bit of guidance from myself and there is even more backstory here because the book was supposed to come out October 17th 2017 that is when the book was being released and for that release of the book I had nine days of media scheduled in New York City with all the cable news networks and the syndicated radio interviews and the articles and the podcast interviews and all the stuff was set up and scheduled so people would hear about the book and of course all this stuff is what the publisher and the public sets up because they're trying to sell the book and it's the big chance to get on the New York Times bestseller list and the Wall Street Journal bestseller list and the USA today list and the Amazon list and all that and of course I know that because of the situation none of this is going to happen I know that I have to take care of my friend I have to see him off and I didn't take care of his mom and his dad and his brother and his sister so the entire nine days of media got completely canceled I did zero didn't even do my own podcast about this book in fact that's the only week where this podcast did not come out and I went to three memorial services for Seth and to his burial at Fort Rose Crans National Cemetery there was a memorial service in San Diego for the teams there was one in Houston his hometown for his Texas friends and family and there was one in Hawaii which was the location of the unit that he was attached to when he died and I had the honor of escorting his mom throughout all these events as he Seth had requested in a letter he had sent in case he died and we saw him off as best we could including going surfing and including setting something on fire at dusk which he had also requested in that letter and we burned what was left of an old surfboard that Seth had given to my son which my son had broken and we also burned an old guitar of mine that could not be tuned at least no one could tune it except for Seth somehow he could tune up a no one else could so it was of no use anymore so we set them aflame in a giant bonfire on the beach near our favorite surf spot and we push the burning surfboard out to see Viking style and we say goodbye but we will remember now what made me think about all this is that the other day I got asked a question someone asked me what your favorite mantra and of course when I when I think of mantras I think of the generic and I guess cheesy is the word for lack of a better word mantras that you hear that if you can believe it you can achieve it or or you know failure is part of the road to success or whatever whatever those things are the standard kind of mantras nothing against them but they're not really they're not really my things so this person asked me what's my favorite mantra and I say you know I'm not I'm not really into the whole mantra thing I don't really say anything to myself I just I just do what I do and this was on a call and and Jamie who is the operations director Deschalant front and she's also an instructor and she was on the call as well and she kind of chimed in to tighten me up with my answer she said she said jacco she said everything you say is a mantra you speak in mantras maybe not to yourself but the rest of us you speak in mantras and I thought about that for about a quarter of a second and I realize that she was absolutely right discipline equals freedom yes that's a mantra and I absolutely live by that good that's a mantra stay on the path that's a mantra and not only do I say these things but I actually wrote a book filled with these mantras and the title of the book is actually the mantra itself discipline equals freedom then not only that but I realized that even though I'm saying oh you don't need a mantra I need them at least sometimes sometimes like I had when it's said I needed to hear or I needed to read my own words to get me through to figure out where to go to figure out what to do well the rest of the cool part of the back stories that when the book came out it came out with no media at all it still made all those lists because you all supported it but I never covered it on the podcast and I never explained what it actually is what the book is where it came from and I just released a new version of it so I forget I better tell you and what the book is it's like an operating system well yes it's like my operating system and I originally wrote it I originally wrote it because people were asking me the same questions all the time about the same subject about jiu-jitsu and about diet and about workouts and how to overcome obstacles or how to handle defeat or failure or whatever all the same questions so I said you know what I'm just going to my original plan was and I said it on the podcast and I still get I still get messages about this what I said on the podcast is that look you all are asking me a bunch of these questions I'm just going to publish a quick ebook I'll get it together in a few weeks and get it out there and so I actually told my publisher hey I'm going to publish a little ebook about this stuff in my publisher said no no please don't do that do not publish an ebook please said you just you just were the number one New York times best selling author you don't publish an ebook well what I told them was well sorry but I'm going to I'm going to just do this as an ebook because I don't want you to tell me what has to be in there how long it has to be or what it needs to look like or any of that stuff I want to do whatever I want to do and the only way I can do whatever I want to do is if I just do it myself and I was looking into how we're going to get this thing printed so I had a vision in my mind I knew what I wanted the book to to be and my publisher to his credit and maybe to his own possible mistake said I will publish whatever you want and I said really and he said whatever you want so that's what this book is it's not a normal book if you haven't seen it before it's not a normal book the way it's written the the format of it the way it's laid out the I guess what is it the color of the pages it's just a different it's a whole different scenario of a book and well I guess if we want to learn a little bit about the book there is a visual impact to the book echo channels is there yes there is it's a really hard to print you know because instead of being white pages with like simple black letters there's all these images in the background of every single page most of the images are black and then the writing is almost all in white so it's a different book has a different visual impact it's cool some people send me pictures of they'll just have this book sitting somewhere it's sort you know just kind of have it in its position so so let's go to the book I'll I'll read through some of the stuff the the opening section is called the way of discipline people look for the shortcut the hack and if you came here looking for that you won't find it the shortcut is a lie the hack doesn't get you there and if you want to take the easy road it won't take you where you want to be stronger smarter faster healthier better free to reach goals and overcome obstacles and be the best version of you possible will not happen by itself it will not happen cutting corners taking shortcuts or looking for the easy way there is no easy way there is only hard work late nights early mornings practice rehearsal repetition study sweat blood toil frustration and discipline discipline there must be discipline discipline the route of all good qualities the driver of daily execution the core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say not today not now I need a rest I will do tomorrow what's the hack how do you become stronger smarter faster healthier how do you become better how do you achieve true freedom there is only one way the way of discipline so that's the opening of the book you know this is not there's not a this is not a verbose book you don't get paid by the word like the old newspaper writers you should get paid by the word not getting paid by the word trying to say what I'm trying to say that's it so so that that is from the first section of this book and the first section of this book is called thoughts and then the second section is called actions and the action sections includes three parts one is fuel one is one is repair and maintenance and one is the workouts so let me give you some more of these thoughts this one's called overcoming procrastination when and where to start people want to know how to stop laziness they want to know how to stop procrastination they have an idea in their head maybe even a vision but they don't know where to start so they ask and they say where do I start when is the best time to start and I have a simple answer here and now that's it you want to improve you want to get better you want to get on a workout program or a clean diet or start a new business you want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or an app where do you start you start right here when do you start you start right now you initiate action you go here is the reality the idea isn't going to execute itself that book isn't going to write itself those weights out in the gym they aren't going to move themselves you have to do it and you have to do it now so stop thinking about it stop dreaming about it stop researching every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it start doing it take that first step and make it happen get after it here and now you've been kind of getting after it lately haven't you? you made a goal you were telling me you have goals is this lens of is this kind of a new I think it's it was a progressive kind of thing it started with kind of certain things you know remember I told you I got a not a journal but what do you call like a planner? yeah you got the day planner and I've tried the planner thing many times but not like the one that you actually write in with a pencil okay you know the kind like online I got my digital my phone you know yeah it's a weird thing there's a weird thing that happens when you go physical I right yes for me that was the case for sure I could some people that's how like if you go did they got their cool app organizer app whatever and it works apparently you know a lot of people use it so you know you can't try to kind of can't refute that yeah but it didn't work for me like it didn't stick at all many many times you know I even did on the computer where I was like oh I'm gonna and I'm leaving on the desktop so I can all we see it and we'll still like it worked for certain things but not for like not for like making a bunch of videos for this but it was stuff that I would always have to revisit mentally you know and I'd be like okay it's open okay there it is there but no yeah now for clients I got a planner and a pencil a special pencil for the planner oh mechanical pencil yeah I'm a big mechanical pencil guy yeah because you can write you can write super small you need to like man yeah it's good and then you can erase it anyway so it started with that like months ago almost here really and that helped because it's interesting as I read this book you know right now and as I was reviewing it I was thinking about you because you've been kind of like almost involuntarily put on the path I guess it's like I mean you just been overexposed I mean just there's no way for you to kind of not I mean you're sitting here for hundreds and hundreds of hours yeah so your life has transformed in many ways yeah big time it's funny okay here's a quick story not de-gate too much but I'm kind of so my daughter she's the kind like she likes certain things and then certain things she just straight up doesn't like so you make her start running laps hard so like that kind of stuff so we took her you know it was it was my nephew slash son we you took him to a running coach and yeah and this coach has a group of kids all bearing levels all the way up until like guys getting full ride scholarships to like Oregon for lacrosse like the like high level athlete that's a good runner who the coach no who oh Jason yeah we don't know that's the thing we don't know so we you know and he had some friends in there and stuff like that so they were like hey come and see this coach and all this stuff former marine by the way older guy and uh and there's a bunch of kids there and they're all doing their things so I'm like yeah let's through my daughter and there too she's seven but young kid you know and there were a couple of other young boys in there eight is you know and I'm like she's not kind of like this if this is hard conditioning like track practice which it was by the way um it's it's she's not gonna like this stuff she's gonna be whatever and she did start crying at one point but she did everything that's the thing okay so the point is how I wound up on the path even though I got a mid like I've always wanted to like improve but let's face it I go with the wave man and sometimes beneficial something and a lot of times not for sure but I watched her and she was nervous she's not used to this kind like intensity you know and this guy is the coach he's really cool man he's he's but he's not mellow he's making jokes he's putting you down all jokes he can totally tell but you know she didn't know what to make of that and so but meanwhile all the kids are listening so he's like oh right now you know this kind of and the kids are just going so she has kind of no choice but to follow the wave you know if it was me and her by herself at any given moment should be like wait I don't want to do that I want to do that but when everyone else is doing it her whole at that moment environment is just react or moving but you get caught up in that wave it's kind of interesting because you you use the same metaphor for both for two opposite things you said you well you know I want to get better but you know sometimes it's kind of go with the wave right exactly and now the sudden you're saying that in this situation depending on the direction of the wave the wave is going in a good direction you kind of get caught that's what I feel like you you know you hanging out with me for the last five years by the way of just the podcast because we've been hanging out for a lot longer than that and look let's face it you had a lot of elements of of discipline and hard work I mean you you you played football obviously you got a hard work do that you know you you're awesome at jujitsu you're you know you you obviously work out hard so you have like some aspects in your life that were real kind of strong some other aspects your life we had some areas we could have improved we had a little bit more on the path they wouldn't they want to kind of write a different wave yes so yeah it's cool yeah that that wave is powerful like you know they say and there's a bunch of cool quote unquote cool tag lines where it's like oh you you're network is your net worth and like all this and basically they're awesome that's see that's what somebody asked me like what's your favorite mantra I started thinking of all those things and I was like oh you know what I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get here and Jamie was like she typed me up she's like hey jocke what everything you say is a fontra on my she's like you might not you might not think it but we all think it's true and all sorts of the truth and and those monsters even the quote unquote cheesy ones they all root the root of all of them are legitimate yeah they're not untrue yeah and some of them are absolutely like yes 100% yeah and these network is your net work and like show me your five friends I'll show you the future or whatever like all that they're all saying the same thing it's kind of like your environment is this big wave that's gonna influence you and you're gonna be writing that thing and you can fight against it you can write away that you can do whatever you want to do but rather that's a wave you might want to pick the right wave but if you pick the right wave you're good but me in this case I kind of a way didn't really pick any wave at all I'm essentially wrote one wave right into another wave and luckily that wave was going in the right direction and it was huge it is huge so yeah and I was down for it so yeah man I'm writing it and you know trying to do the right things for sure and yes very very beneficial check this next section I'm gonna jump through a bunch of these real quick but this one's called the person you can control people are not who you want them to be kill your idols sure there are things we can learn from people but people aren't going to be what you think they are what they should be people even those people you have put on a pedestal are going to be falted week ego maniacal condescending they are going to be lazy entitled short-sighted they will be they will not be perfect far from it that's fine learn from their weaknesses of course learn from their strengths and mimic and copy them and what they do well but equally as important learn from their faults see what not to do because you can't control other people you can't make them what you want them to be you can't make them who you want them to be the only person you can control is you so focus on making yourself who you want to be faster stronger smarter more humble less ego discipline your body free your mind get up early and go get after it and you'll become the person you want to be and you become that person through one small decision at a time yeah as you can see this is a book of mantras yes and then but it's not all that it's also there's also some you know there's actually a bunch of pragmatic information here's one section like that stress first of all and I don't mean to minimize the stress people face but imagine what Eugene's sled went through on Pelaloo and the tens of thousands of marines there who suffered unimaginable horror imagine what David Hacworth imagine David Hacworth assaulting enemy positions in Korea wounded over and over again on the line still going back for more imagine a poet warrior Alan Seeger and World War I getting ready to go over the top and make his rendezvous with death imagine the thousands of warriors who have gone before you who have stood and faced evil and death and now imagine you I used to do this myself while in Iraq facing stress yes we took casualties and yes it was awful and heartbreaking and every bit is wretched as I could imagine but warriors have faced much much worse the battle of the Psalm or getty's bird or the battle of the bulge or the chosen reservoir Hugh humans can withstand almost inconceivable stress and you can too so that is your first step gain perspective and to do that you must do something critical in many situations detach whatever problems or stress you are experiencing detach from them stresses generally caused by what you can't control the worst thing about incoming artillery fire is you can't control it it is happening and you just have to accept it don't stress about things you can't control if the stress is something that you can control and you are not that is a lack of discipline and a lack of ownership get control of it impose your will to make it happen solve the problem relieve the stress if the stress is something you can't control in brace it you can't control it but how can you look at it from a different angle how can you use it to your advantage I couldn't control the chaos of combat I had to embrace it I had to figure out a way to take advantage of it make it into your ally so don't fight stress embrace it turn it on itself use it to make yourself sharper and more alert use it to make you think and learn and get better and smarter and more effective use the stress to make you better this is one this is one that you know I I kind of have to go over this one and it's it's again there's a bunch of these and they're all very short like this or within these types of lengths it's kind of thing you can read for three minutes before you start your day before you work out before you go to bed at night maybe that might not be the best idea because if you treat you know you might start getting the ideas in your head and I have a real problem with that like I have ideas in my head if I have ideas in my head do you have your do you ever can't sleep is that ever happening why you got it I just wonder is that a thing it doesn't seem like you be like common at me with like a little trouble sleeping right it seems like you fully embrace sleeping like I might embrace stress yes yeah dance your way yeah I'm in before that reason for sure so you get a cool idea you can't wait like I can't wait to see a cool idea the thing that's kind of cool about you though is if you get a good idea at midnight you can just get up and start working on it and sleep until 10 yes no fact me I got you like you have I think you don't have any schedule really of any kind not as far as regular schedule stuff no so other people have things that they have to do in my fun to do it yeah yeah so so this one this is not the kind of things that you want to read like right before you go to bed maybe because for me what happens it's the weirdest thing it's I've never done a psychedelic drug before but it kind of feels like a psychedelic drug where my mind is going down paths like I'm thinking about something and I can feel it like you know when I like a special of like an old school special effect when you go through some like space tunnel like a place time tunnel or something or something like a normal thing so I'll be doing that and then all of a sudden it'll go like a roller coaster off to a side and go down all I'll go down some other what you call it what I go down some other wormhole of thought but then it just branches off and it just keeps going so my it's like I'm going to a thousand miles an hour inside my own head then you there's no way I can sleep yeah I can see how that could be yeah it's it's a bummer so I would say use a little caution if you're going to read them before you go to bed I would more read them in the morning I would more you know read them during the day have the books sit now have it you know like in a place where you're thinking about it and you can pick it up sometimes here's here's what here's what I called compromise when working with other people and dynamic situations and relationships and deals a person especially a leader must compromise finding the common ground between teams merging different approaches to the same problem bridging personalities with people who might not get along reaching agreements and courses of action all these require compromise and in many cases a failure to compromise is a failure to succeed so so it's important because you know a lot of times people might well the not even might a lot of times people have the impression me there's no compromise when the reality is like oh what do you want to do that sounds like a good idea let's move in that direction as a leader it's you actually have to do that a good leader does that a good leader compromise is to a lot of things right of course you're going to have principles and values that you can't compromise but those should be small we're not small they're huge but they should be a small number of things so going back to the book but those are external compromises with other people other humans that have their own personalities and ethos and issues and compromise is needed in order to unify so to work with them compromise is a must but internally it's different with myself I have to hold the line there are areas within myself where I cannot compromise I am going to work hard I am going to train hard I am going to improve myself I am going I am not going to rest on my laurels I'm going to own my mistakes and confront them I am going to face my demons I am not going to give up or give out or give in I am going to stand I am going to maintain myself discipline and on those points there will be no compromise not now not ever reading that right before I go to sleep probably not going to do it because then I probably do a burpees in the corner of the room but it's on a ton of these things you know skip through a bunch of them right now there's one that I like in here it's called binary code I know you like that because you're a computer expert it says machines make their decisions based on binary code yes or no it is not complicated are you going to work out yes or no are you going to get up yes or no are you going to get off the couch yes or no are you going to eat that donut yes or no this is not complicated and sometimes you have to put yourself into this mode binary decision making are you going to be weak or strong are you going to be healthier unhealthy are you going to improve your life are you going to make it worse are you going to sacrifice long term success for shirt short term gratification you know the right answers you know the right decisions don't over complicate binary decision making make the right decisions that's your whole dealer it's kind of it's kind of like part you know that mode there and it's more about yourself though I think like with other people that's the thing that's the thing let's so strange about this is this stuff rings so true in my head for me but like with other people as a leader interacting in relationships like this doesn't work yeah that's weird but yeah when it comes to stuff that like you're talking to me honest like like with me like even just like the look you know like a fall you know I tend to from time to time whatever go down certain over explanations and like all this stuff whatever and you're looking at me with the zero like a straight up zero almost like it's literally zero what's a zero you know you got the one and you got the zero all right you're super good you know you're assuming yeah I got it um and the value of your statement to zero I got it you literally look at every like that kind of like oh yeah and here's the thing though that's real beneficial to though and that's part of this whole way but I think anyway where you know I'm over here you know we're all in our own head from time to time if not all the time whatever and then it's good to have that little reflective like situation where I'm saying what's in my head to see how it sort of lands on the outside world and when that thing is literally like not computing it all you're like all right well I guess I can do a way with that thought you know kind of thing and then you know sometimes you'll have like a reaction is okay that's maybe viable whatever and after a while all those zeros and ones sort of kind of formulate a little little line of code you know now we can go do some things you know kind of thing and and that's kind of like the influence but it's interesting how that you put it in that book where you got to get in that mode because you can't be like that with everything you know but but sometimes you just get in that mode and you're like all right like especially with the workout I mean that's an obvious one where you're like right you're gonna work out or not and if you're like later okay so no then are you gonna work out right now because that's what the plan was or that's what you were trying to do or whatever right and then if you're like on that it's like oh it's real clear you know so yeah man if you can get in that mode when you need to either yes or no and you know that's a thing I think to to compliment what you're saying when when you take all that gray area you know this is the important thing when you take the gray area you know what the right answer is right you can make a lot of things that make it seem like there's a whole bunch of different options there but there's really only two options you're gonna work out or you're not and all the other little things that you're thinking they're they're they're just they're just they're just they're just junk right they're just junk yeah that gray area as you mentioned it's like there's so much a danger in there there's so much oil and slippery stuff in there but that lead that out there so like okay the workout right well it's a big gray area you can throw in there I'll do it later that's one right because the fact is you can do it later and get it done straight up kind of you know you got something super important like that's a possibility you know but you start throwing that that in there it's like oh man that becomes dangerous because I would say if if considering that I'm a normal person if I throw in the idea of all do it later the chance of me doing it later goes down way more if compared to if I just say hey did it am I gonna do it now or am I not gonna do it and we're gonna do it or not gonna do it so if you say if you had three choices do it now do it later don't do it the easiest pick is kind of do it later right but do it later doesn't lead the execution doesn't lead yeah it doesn't directly lead to execution what's your percentage of when you say you'll do it later what's a percentage of execution later well now we're going deeper because do it later what does that actually mean how later in an hour later let's say in a in a in a window of time that could still be considered part of this scenario yeah you see I would say a maximum so my later we got to establish that later as opposed to tomorrow yeah let's you miss it work out later is definitely I mean same day in this scenario for it work out we're definitely talking about today same day right yeah that's usually like a three four five six hour window so if I can so the percentage of me doing it later it's weird because you know maps kind of form in your mind so if I don't get it done in the morning like before noon because you want to get your lunch or what yeah you work out on an empty stomach yeah so damn you too the norm is I don't eat nothing until the work out dinner okay dinner and then late dinner that's sort it it wait did you say dinner and late dinner so two dinners yeah yeah I didn't dinner with the family shared this with me bruh yeah and then the pre go to bed dinner that's interesting but the window how the window goes and it's just a schedule that established itself in my mind is a workout during the day or during the morning if I don't do that it's a four thirty workout pretty much for thirty across the board that's cool so you put a little deadline on yourself kind of that kind of becomes binary right it's either now or it's at four thirty yeah yeah that's kind of a good good program yeah what happens at four thirty I work out so you're saying get it done later actually you do a good percentage of getting it done later yeah but that's gonna make a really good point because technically I did go binary in almost like a second level binary situation which starts to become less and less binary if it's either now or four thirty yeah so I kind of for me four thirty means a different it means twelve hours prior but thirty in the morning but yeah man but again if and I do this naturally and it's good to have these kinds like this book or whatever just sort of pointed out for you where if I don't get it if I'm not prepping the workout drinking water out there shoes on blah blah if that's not happening between four and four thirty if I get to four forty five five if it's past five it probably won't happen just because there's other things that the household kind of needs me for you know it's so cool that your mind can be so easily reset like you're like oh you got this book like if you pick this book up and you're reading it you're gonna get it done right I mean you're you're you're you it's gonna hit you it's gonna hit you you're gonna you're gonna think yourself you know what that's correct I need to go do this I need to control myself I need to make this happen I need to go and execute I need to I need to you go in a binary mode and make this happen like you have so much influence over your brain that's so good if you put your brain on the right wave because if you put it on the right wave you're gonna go place if you put it in the wrong wave we're going down down the wrong place man we're going in a bad way so you're and it's incredible that you can so easily put your well here's the difference you can put your it takes a small bit of effort you pick the book this book you read it right you're like oh I'm gonna go get some that took a small amount of effort very small amount of effort and it puts you on the right path what strange is if you don't do anything we know where it goes right it just kind of the other wave is just kind of there just always just pulling it you just drag it and you down yeah it's just constantly there yeah I mean the wave analogy is really good respawn on because like if you're in the ocean right you're going this way you're going that way you're going there everyone's while you catch a current you know go you know kind of in this direction first thing they've been a amount of time or whatever or distance and then but by if you get on one of those waves brought you're going full speed you know what you can get caught in a rip current you're going out to see like a bad way right you go down the downward spiral of horribleness ditching savagery right wrong wave yeah it's true um but I've always looked at this book as like I mean it seems like I like I feel like a ferrell manual you know how like okay it's called a field man you're like you're right so you know like if if your car has a I don't know check engine later I don't know you know whatever some issue with your car and you're not you know super well versed in like automchanics whatever and you're like hey man I've been looking to this I got a small issue with my car I got to know how to solve this issue where do you go for you know when there's manual or am I connected to whatever let's say if you need some answers you go to the manual you know that manual is for your car straight up you can go to the internet for sure but you go to the manual you're going to get the answer for your question however it's directed directly linked to your issue with your specificer this manual if you regard that as your manual for not necessarily your physical but but for how you are gonna be those answers are for you then oh yeah all day because you know it's easy to go on the internet the gram right I'm a following inspirational person you know and maybe that applies to me maybe it doesn't and then after a while it's all just sort of like yeah I heard that before cool saying let me go back to what I was doing kind of a thing and it sort of doesn't land anymore but if you regard again like this book for you like you need and you say you know just how you said it's like gonna go where you can just just pick it up and just read it you know for a minute or whatever that answer whatever you read that is for you it nit crazy though that like and that's what that's what all the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is because like that whole thing was Seth like I needed my own book I needed to go to the owner's manual yeah I needed that my so I wrote these words I contemplated them I lived through them I garnered the experience and then at the moment in time I actually needed to go to this manual and say what am I supposed to do right now yeah exactly right and that there's all kinds of you know I mean that's an extreme example but you know even as I read like the binary code thing it's like yes oh yeah how easy is it to just go and add other way over there that's kind of going to a horrible you know lame week place filled with gray excuses and justifications if you're gonna justify yourself yeah gray all day you know not black going anyway so that's that's what that's what the that's what the thoughts and there's a bunch of these more and this the the the new field manual that's the difference is I added a but a bunch more of into this thought section about mind control about weakness and about the destroyer mode and about the application of discipline about the fear of failure and about what to do and you're not feeling it and what what to do and you get overwhelmed and how to detach and how to handle the feet and just all these things that we need help with that I need help with that we as human beings need help with a bunch of stuff in there that you can pick up and that will keep you on the path but as we know thoughts only go so far right we have to take action which is the next section of the book it is called actions and and the first little section in actions is physical training subtitle getting after it yes there physical training back to the book there are all kinds of benefits from physical training you will be healthier this is a fact by working out you will increase your endorphins testosterone go form on cardiac value insulin sensitivity and natural killer cells those changes will help prevent or treat the following health issues high blood pressure obesity heart disease type 2 diabetes in Somia and depression boom still not convinced working out will make you smarter yes smarter it improves blood flow to the brain it boosts growth hormones that promote growth of new nerve cells it improves synaptic plasticity the ability for neurons to send and receive messages it releases brain chemicals that help cognition like dopamine glutamate nor an effort and serotonin it also boosts the production of brain derived neurotropic factor approaching that helps with mental processes but don't just take my word for it go do get some exercise done and pay attention to your mental state you will feel more aware sharper and smarter this is real there you go this is like oh why do you want to physically why do you want to work out it actually makes you smarter look it makes you stronger it makes you more healthy but it made I might my my my daughter all this daughter was taking a what a final exam to a final week all day she's all stressed out you know because she likes to get whatever high grades and stuff yeah that whole thing yeah and uh she was like told I go you need to go and and it just so happened when I see this out when it was reviewing for this book but I was reviewing like you know I did a bunch of research and read a bunch of stuff because look I know I feel I know I feel smarter and better when I work out but when I was writing this book I said okay what is that you know so I started asking I talked to Peter or Tier 2 to go I was like hey what what is up with us and these are the kind of things these big words these big medical words that I put in there right so I told my daughter said go for like at least a 20 minute workout before this examination and she did so that's what you need that's why we're working out that's why we're working out it's so obvious that it's so good for you and even from the earliest of podcast echo trials you made this statement exercise is like the thing that you can do in your life that will positively impact the most other things in your life which is a bold statement and a true statement in my humble opinion stress the good and the bad this is this is an area where I talk about stress and look in order to improve we need stress we need to push the body and the mind in order to get better one of our main physical reactions to stress is to release the hormone cortisol into the body it has a multitude of effects including making glucose available and so I go into this what it does what stress does to you and and it's positive because it generates energy it focuses energy it focuses you on immediate threats it prepares you for immediate threats so that stuff is all good it allows you to do better in the world but you can also go overboard with it stress can be bad so I go through that too much stress and the cortisol is released too often it it it's like a car running in the red so I go into that whole thing so what we have to do is you have to stress the body and the mind in order to improve but obviously you can't overstress it so I talk through that whole thing and here's something I was like you know I'll cover this on the podcast and this section is called sleep this is for the haters can I use that word and not be a 15 year old girl oh yeah sure the haters so so obviously you know I get up early every day and get stuff done oh man you took you back down the other day what up oh yeah I chose traveling so good point so the other day I was traveling my flight was delayed or whatever and I didn't get back into SD until midnight got home at 1230 and I had spent a couple days on East Coast time so I wasn't even really like I do always entire so I probably fell asleep at like a 130 my alarm went off at 430 and I was like I didn't play this see what this feels like at 430 that 430 I wasn't yeah so I went back to sleep why because sleep is good for you and if you don't have enough sleep you don't you don't perform well you don't think well now listen here's the thing people go crazy with this right and people you should read this you should like they say if you have less than 8 hours of sleep you're like being a drunk yeah that is just factually untrue right I'm telling you I have like you've been to the muster right at some of the early musters where life and I are on stage we're answering questions we're interacting with people we're roleplaying we're going through dynamics and areas we're we're performing cognitive cognitive tasks for 8 and a half straight 8 and a half 9 10 hours straight we had one hour of sleep not kidding this some of those musters the new York muster I think we had like one hour of sleep so if we had if if before the muster I had done 16 shots of yager muster the muster would have been a lot different now some people might have liked it those people wanted their money back so look sleep so so this is people think I don't like sleep or I don't support sleep or I think you know you and it's not true and I was saying when people you think you're you're you're giving people advice that's unhealthy here's the actual advice that I give people from the book sleep is an necessity humans need sleep failure to get enough sleep has serious side effects lack of sleep can cause negative hormonal changes interfere with them metabolizing glucose of glucose increase blood pressure and suppress the immune system less sleep also means less human growth hormone in your body which means less muscle mass and weaker bones mentally the brain is impacted as the ability to pay attention and concentrate begins to diminish and problem solving and basic reasoning becomes less acute furthermore over an extended period there are psychological effects like paranoia and even hallucinations so that's me talking about sleep you need to sleep I'm not anti-sleep is there a thing called a fast sleeper yes we'll get there we'll get there so so check this out but how much sleep is enough different people need different amounts of sleep new borns can sleep up to 17 hours a day toddlers can sleep 12 hours a day as people grow older less sleep is required teens generally need 8 to 10 hours and by the time people are full of adults 8 hours becomes the standard even though the actual number is between 7 and 9 hours depending on the individual some people genetically need even less sleep than that but those people are rare I'm one of those people and this isn't I don't have the proof well here's my proof I guess I'm proof my oldest daughter is like me like last night she was studying she's went to bed at midnight I woke up at 4th of the she's up and then she took an exam cognitive not impaired right she's gonna get an A you know what I'm saying so but but my second daughter the girl likes to sleep like she'll get out of bed when you go drag her out of bed right like she likes to sleep my son kind of it kind of normal I would say my wife she digs that sleep mm so some of my kids get some of it my youngest daughter she's sort of a little bit I would see that's sleep too but but so there's so so I think there is some sort of genetic thing here's a but it's it's people also will look you that it's so rare there's no chance you have it okay cool I'm gonna I can really tell you people like people say sleep more I'm not trying to sleep less I'm more than happy to sleep you know but it just doesn't happen so going on here but it isn't only genetics you can also sleep less and fall sleep faster if you are in good physical condition eating clean and have a clear mind for me the better condition I'm in and the cleaner I eat the more quickly I will fall asleep and the less sleep I need do you notice this do you notice that you need to less sleep when you're fasting I don't notice but I'm not paying attention okay I like going I when I'm fasting I feel like I'm on fire yeah and I I just did a fast I just did a 48 hour and I feel I felt like later again like I was waking up earlier than I normally wake up so while I do have short sleep genetics on my side equally important is that I stay healthy and eat clean what about when you eat junk how don't you need to sleep more yeah but actually you know what it's really inconsistent when you junk or sorry when I eat junk it's sometimes all sleep less but be wanting to sleep more but you know the kind like you're tired and you feel sleepy but you can't like go to sleep you know it's like that there's a lot of that go in the worst I think you feel like you wish you would sleep more but you can you kind of can't just get up yeah exactly and feel like crap or whatever and sort of you know maybe catch the next wave of sleepiness I guess the and on the inverse when you're talking about like when you exercise consistent you eat clean or whatever and it's really different where and it's really real clear where you feel freaking solid during the day and then once that bedtime ish kind of rolls around you just feel the wave just crash and you're like oh it's bit sleep time so good yeah it's really good when you worked out hard you had a good day you ate clean you get to the end of that you're like boom you're out right that's how it was yesterday and like and I got like an hour less sleep than I normally did the day before so but I got up solid boom feeling good now that we're thinking about this when I have like those weird roller coaster brain rides that's usually that's usually when I'm like something's messed up you know what weather I'm eating crap or or whatever yeah bro it was the kind of like I do quizzes in story time for what the kids before bed every night is like what eight or clock eight 30 bro it was the time like it's a kind in the middle of a question that I'm asking it's straight up that's a day right there yeah it's like okay it's about that yeah I I've had that world when my kids were a little and I was telling the durs you know you're just getting up at 430 you're doing whatever you're doing at water come home you know and you're just getting bed read that story next thing you know it's free a clock at the morning for clock the morning what just happened yeah my wife left me in there because she was running around with three kids at the time you know trying to get them all square to waste you like oh you got the kid school she probably went to a bar out on the what she did that she knows that girl went to sleep she used to fall asleep with someone kid almost every night it was crazy so going on here and finally I choose not to sleep in I don't give in to the pillow I don't give into the temptation of warm blankets or soft pillow I mobilize the will to get me out of bed and get into the game obviously I'm an advocate of waking up early but since sleep must be a priority to maintain health how can we get enough sleep and still wake up early the answer is simple go to bed earlier go to bed earlier now I'm gonna skip the little bit here go forward well this I talked about some of the benefits like what are the benefit why do I wake up early and I mean first there's some simple math but why do you wake up early the world is yours when you're up before the enemy there's no traffic the gym is empty there's no one distract you or call you or send you some stupid text about something you don't care about so there's like all these benefits to to being up early but then going back to the other point falling asleep how do you fall asleep so this is kind of what we're just talking about number one and there's a whole section I'm gonna read some highlights of it number one get tired yes get tired if you are not active throughout the day you won't be tired you know it's weird as a recording the podcast depending on the podcast I'm usually super wired when we get done recording and then I'm tired you know it's a mental mental work yeah fully on number two turn off the computer turn off the smartphone stop checking social media and stop watching one more YouTube video sure there's some science it says that the light from the computer and phone screen tricks your mind and thinking is daylight and time to get up but on top of that the internet is filled with professionals that create content with the sole purpose of getting you to click on it yes clickbait is real and just like the bait used in fishing it is a trick to get you hooked so don't don't click it you will get nothing positive at all number three read if your mind is still active when you reach your bedtime that's okay get into bed and get a book and start reading reading is relaxing it settles your mind and makes you smarter so do it dude reading will reading I think reading is a massive sleep aid yeah everyone's wanting to like you not everyone's well most of them actually in my experience because I wouldn't be reading a boring book that's his first specific purpose but usually they're interesting books so at first I might be like oh kind of excited but yeah man after it depends on the day or whatever but it can be like after like 10 minutes 15 minutes I you know the kind of books I read because I read them on the podcast all the time I'm talking about books about war combat in the most dynamic heroic situations like even those books if I'm reading I'll be like oh if it's nighttime and I'm reading I'll I'll get tired of falsely yeah I mean I won't I don't falsely while I'm reading I really do that but I'll be like okay I'm tired yeah I've missed out the book and go bad oh yeah then that's exactly what I'm saying or maybe at first if it's like super interesting or exciting whatever book you're like at first you're like oh man let's get some reading going you know about this whatever you're reading about and then yeah after like I said it depends on how your state of mine is but as far as time goes but yeah after a little while you're ready you're ready to go sleep I just got done reading a book for the podcast that it was it was it was a book that I like was actively couldn't sleep because I just was like I'm gonna read this more of this because I want to know what's about the happen that's pretty crazy. Number four most important the key to getting to sleep early is getting up early. No it might not help you tonight but tomorrow night it will. If you need seven full hours of sleep and you want to get up at 430 a.m. that means you need to go to bed at 930 p.m. but it is hard to force yourself to sleep at 930 so you stay up until 1130 you should still get up at 430 yes that will only be five hours of sleep and yes you will likely feel tired throughout the day which is actually good because at the end of the day you'll want to be tired now you can go to bed at 930 and get yourself back on track that's that's the part that people if you want to be tired at night at 930 you need to get up early you can't you can't get up at 9 in the morning and expect to be tired at 9 at night it won't happen and the last thing is do it every day right and this is like you know weekend this way it's just whatever to do the same time look if you want to give yourself an extra half an hour I don't even recommend that I recommend you get up at the same time every day yeah that um here's a mistake I think that well when I say some people me I make this mistake or I have made this mistake straight up where I'll be like okay yeah I'm gonna do that I want to get up early you know and earlier whatever so I'll just wake up earlier and be tired throughout the day but what I did is I didn't look at the big picture I was like all just automatically be tired at night you know but what I did was I would lays through the desk it worked out a lot of laying down on the couch you know a lot more than normal and then you know you know you basically sense your tired you kind of adjust your activity accordingly you know in a bad way so you do just way less and then nighttime comes you're not as tired as as you could have been if you just went about your normal routine sure you got power through it little bit harder for sure if you're on less sleep or whatever but at the end when it comes time to sleep which was your goal it's gonna be way more like it's gonna happen easy you know or it's gonna happen in my case they just straight up doesn't happen I'm freaking up late again can't go sleep with him yeah gotta be careful so yeah do the normal routine don't be slacking I got a little section on here on power and apps people like do you take an app yes I do if I'm super tired but I then I explain the whole thing in here elevate your feet above your heart which I learned from one of my high school teachers and then I only sleep for like eight minutes and if you really tired eight minutes seems like you just got a full on massive amount of sleep yeah remember we were talking about the two types of tired yeah yeah this sleepy tired and then there's like physical fatigue yeah kind of and then you know what kind of in the total eight minute nap thing sometimes six minutes it's almost like in this is all what do you call hypothesis and what will say that where if like if you could just go like if you just did like a marathon freaking podcasters or you know after you do a podcast you mentioned where you're kind of tired you know something that that that required like cognitive effort for a somewhat sustained amount of time you you're not exhausted physically but mentally you might have like this sharpness they usually have this just dull because like your your foot like it's almost like a superficial conscious like cognitive like a bit almost that's what it almost seems like so if I'm working on something on the computer like admin numbers or freaking stuff not editing stuff like you know work for like three hours and then it's work out time I'm gonna take one of those six minute eight minute in a couple so much yeah for sure but the thing is like six minute eight minutes what can what can possibly recover in that I don't know it's real oh yeah it's real and it's like you've ever had a dream in eight minutes oh yeah I have four on dreams and you ever have those little half dreams like okay so usually it happens it is your body moved yes but it's something very specific though where sometimes you just like feel like oh you just jump run almost like oh no for me it's because someone's talking about the lack of my head and my dreams so yeah that makes sense but yes it's that it's that though it's something specific where like like the other days I was I was getting one in and my son in my little dream it lasted literally like two seconds like a two second dream almost and my son like ran under my legs and I like I did jump over him oh my dream yeah so I jumped and I'm like that's what caused me to jump but it was I remember it was my son ran under my legs that sounds a lot more pleasant than a battle axe yeah but I'm very into the battle axe yeah my hair kill you probably a lot different than yours for sure uh next section the workouts everyone wants to know what should a workout actually consist of and first of all let me say this the most important thing is to do something anything walk jog calcenex swim lift some way to hike stretch do burpees play a game of basketball or go get on the gizzi to map some people aren't sure what to do for a workout but that is often just an excuse exercise doesn't need to be some complex multi-level multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional scientifically proven methodology but it does need to be something so go through a whole section about the workouts and then I actually put workouts in the book to see the actual workouts go to appendix the workouts again use the workouts as a guide learn about your own body push yourself most important be consistent and consistency starts with getting in the gym if you are tired or sore or burned out don't just give up completely go to the gym and stretch move do some light exercises but keep the routine in place too often people take the day off and that turns into two and two into three and then they've gone a week without getting in a good workout so maintain the routine maintain the discipline I didn't cover this section but that's I've had a lot of people like this attitude you're tired your sore you feel like you need a day off cool do it tomorrow still do the workout today do tomorrow because it's it's a way tomorrow I was in take the day off tomorrow take the day off tomorrow so you know you go to that spot you're like you know what I could probably just type you know I worked out really hard it's been it's been six days it's been three days straight I'm kind of tired I do have this you know project do I actually really take the day off today okay cool you can take the day off tomorrow still have to do it today I guess what you wake up tomorrow you don't need to take a day off it was all just negotiate yeah look but the cool thing is you maybe you do need to day off cool you wake up the next day you're like god I am so cool take the day off yeah yeah and that's the pre and I've done that before where I'm beyond I'm not that good at doing that yet but I've done that before world be like no I'm going to power through in fact I'm going to go as hard as I freaking can I'm going to go extra hard and then I'll take it tomorrow and then on times where I really did need the day off the next day I feel even worse like oh yeah yeah but other times it's most of the time most of the day it's just the day you don't feel like it you freaking whatever you did last night or whatever it's some some other factor that has to do with just the day you know you're some stances you don't so just like have some minimum work out that you must do yeah yeah yeah like oh you know what oh you're gonna be a you're you're you're you're a millimeter from not doing anything okay I'm gonna go do the minimum work out I'm gonna do this just this stuff get it done and then if I still feel like crap tomorrow I'll take a legit day off yeah and another thing that that is almost like a thing that gets revealed is that minimum workout thing has obviously a bunch of benefits but usually you know how like and again depends on what you were doing before the workout maybe what you're doing last at whatever but a lot of times once you just get the blood flowing right or once you're yeah yeah and this is the thing I don't know that the full ins and outs of it get asked of actual fitness person but like it's it's called priming priming your body and mind whatever for work out so a lot of times you're just deprimed I made that word up deep primed but you understand what I'm saying right it's the opposite of pulling priming sometimes you're just more deprimed than you normally are you know and you're just really not into it for other reasons you know so sometimes that minimum workout you're like all right and you sort it inadvertently primed your whole deal yeah I'm not so retired and over change but I noticed that a lot with with anybody part but like your legs for sure if you know when it's squat day yeah now we don't know what what unseen mechanisms are at work in your brain that are telling you that you're like more sore but a lot of times you're rolling into squat day and you're feeling in your mind you're thinking on pretty sore you're really negotiating hard for that day off and you really notice after you and even your first couple sets you know you're just do you just do some some body weight squats just to warm up and you're like oh I'm definitely sore then you do the 45 pound bar just you're just getting warmed up yeah you take the PVC pipe you do some overhead squats you're like wow I'm definitely sore and then when you start putting some some weight on you start realizing I'm actually not sore I just start feeling good and you're good to go yeah you were good to go that's what that's that happens a lot that happens a lot this seems to happen a lot on on the on the good old squat day too so when you say and this is more your personal thing like your squat day or whatever well you do just squats or legs or whatever or is it like a you know I mean I do some other stuff but yes I will be other body parts or other exercises for later no really it's just about just just squat day yeah squat day which encompasses all kinds of different leg work we'll say yeah I've done I've always done multiple body parts but usually squat day would would be just part of just a multiple body part day but when I sweat it was a hack kind of out of laziness in a way where I'd be like you know what I'm just gonna designate one day for just squats and then I started incorporating just a small muscle group like a girl's situation maybe some triceps then do the squats so if if I do like shoulders for example depends on the workout obviously but if I'm going like hardcore shoulder press then freaking super set of this and that you know a whole shoulder workout and you want me to go do squats now after the age of about 30 that started to be less and less of a sustainable thing mentally in my mind okay that's interesting so you've gotten mentally weaker if you've got as you've gotten older yes there I have apparently that's strange but you sure you just didn't get it smarter where you realized if you really wanted to push you needed to focus you needed to prioritize next cube I would say that that's a good way of putting it making it sound better or rationalizing right and maybe rationalize it or maybe that was the case the whole time you know where I could be benefiting way more from this this this leg workout if I just soloed it one day rather than doing a big other body part workout then than the legs and vice versa too because sometimes I would do the squats first and then suffer through a shoulder workout or something like this yeah but now anyway let's do like I always I always if possible lift before due to yeah right that's do you do that yeah 100% and I'll tell you it's it's not because it's not it's it's it's because Gigi to I don't want to go and work out I would rather go to Gigi to with some muscle fatigue than go to workout with muscle fatigue yeah even though isn't that that seems backwards that seemed counterintuitive I know because you think I'm going to compete against echoes or I want to be ready to go yeah it seems like the intuitive thing but I would much rather just be a little bit tired when I'm rolling with whoever then to be all then to be tired when I roll into the gym yeah well and now I think if you know the dynamics of both types of workouts I think it's obvious that you do want to lift do a lifting before Gigi to because Gigi to has quick diminishing returns with strength that's very quick yeah endurance not so much but muscle like strength or whatever it's quick but it's the opposite for lifting weights so you need your strength you don't necessarily need that much endurance depending on the workout obviously but as far as lifting weights goes you don't need that much endurance but when you go to Gigi to if you don't have that much strength but as long as you can kind of sustain and you know do this thing I mean you're not going to run like a whole crossfit games routine and then go to Gigi to and think you're going to feel good I mean it's a bit different you know but that's true although I'll tell you like I'll do some crazy workouts and so go to Gigi to barely remember that I mean and I'm not talking I go like walk from one to the other you know I work out the morning really hard and then in the afternoon I'm going to Gigi yeah but that time you go what 80-90% of your strength actually it's not that big of a deal yeah and Gigi to different like that because the your energy output in Gigi to is very variable very much so and you can modulate fully like and you know it's going to obviously depend on who you're rolling with as well you go with a tornado dude who's good it's like you're going to feel that workout in the morning if you have that kind of day but if a normal day of Gigi to where some guys you go hard sometimes you go medium sometimes you don't have to go as hard as far as that goes you can modulate and yeah navigate through the energy output easy but as far as like the type of exercise versus the other type of exercise lifting whatever if you switch them around you do Gigi to first and all that sort of sustained output and you thinking and going to go into a lifting and freaking push hard negative yeah that's a weird thing man to weird thing but that's it seems to be you know you're an agreement on that got a section in here on building a home gym and this is obviously with the world that we're in right now with COVID this is a very good thing to have a home gym and you can I go through all the all the kinds of different things that you should get first and the considerations you know get in pull up bar and and then things like you know you I don't have enough money you can get a pull up bar for $9 at home people I'm not even talking about you know you go and whatever you can get a piece of pipe you you have a pull up bar you can get a set of rings for pretty cheap like there's a there's ways that you can make it happen so I got a little section in there and building a home gym yeah the home gym thing that the I think the primary factor that you really have to kind of consider and navigate is the space yeah more so than the money because money is like for the most part you can like spend way less or just you know make payments or whatever even the space though you can see people that do really cool creative things to get good work out in a small space yeah you do and you really need very minimal equipment to be in awesome shape really the only piece of equipment that I think you actually need is a pull up bar because if you have a pull up bar you can do pull ups but you can autumn you can already do push ups did not dips but push ups you can do all kinds of chest variation push up very like you can get crazy with push ups movers millions of different varieties of push ups you can do you can do squats you can do lunches you can do you can do basically your whole body can do handstand push ups for your shoulders like there's so many things that you can do if you just have a pull up bar if you don't have a pull up bar you're kind of yeah that's true yeah like you can't just like because all those things that you said aside from the the anything pulling or whatever you you don't need anything you just get the ground you just need the ground yeah man maybe a wall or a tree or whatever almost every building has a wall yes and every yeah or a tree there's some thing outside of whatever you know but yeah the pulling thing it's hard to our to access if you don't have like a pull up bar rings are really good because then you can not only do pull ups you can also do dips and then there's all kinds of other crazy things that you can do with rings so rings are also awesome the next section is called martial arts again this is an operating this is my operating system and part of my operating system as you've just heard a time out is martial arts and I say everyone should train in martial arts just as everyone should eat but just as food is different and varies greatly in how an affects your body not all martial arts are created equal there are three broad forms of martial arts grappling striking and weapons grappling uses leverage and hold to control or submit your opponent striking you striking uses punches kicks knees elbows head butts or any other body part to hit the opponent martial arts with weapons obviously use utilize a variety of weapons including sticks knives and in the modern world firearms perhaps the most critical form of self defense is the mind by being smart and aware you can avoid situations that are likely to expose you to danger that being said there are times when you're mind and your intelligence can no longer help you that is the reality so that's why we train right because there's as much as someone says you know I I'm able to avoid to look there's gonna be situations that you can end up in even if you're completely situational aware and you're looking to avoid situations they can still happen that's why you have to train I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here because I talk about firearms and the necessity of firearms in certain situations and I say that's most important without proper training possessing a firearm as useless or even more dangerous to its owner than not having one learning how to shoot quickly and accurately while under stress is absolutely mandatory if one is going to own a firearm this means finding a good instructor at a quality range to participate in firearms training right so you you gotta have a firearm and and I'm gonna go back and read a section that I wasn't planning to read but I'm gonna read it anyways it is an eat the firearm the ultimate form of self defense is the firearm it is an equalizer without parallel and it's simply unmashing its ability to eliminate an attacker regardless of size and strength if a person truly needs self protection in a high threat area there is no substitute for the firearm even in an area that might be considered low threat there are no guarantees there have been horrific home invasions car jackings kidnappings and other vicious and violent attacks and some of the most prestigious neighborhoods in the world that were also considered to be the safest there is no choice but to be prepared so firearms talk about some of the training and what you do and you know some of the some of the benefits of it firearms training build to hand eye coordination speed, concentration and instincts it demands repetitive movement develop muscle memory so there's there's other benefits to to utilizing firearms than just self protection training competitive flee for speed and accuracy conditions you for high pressure situations by teaching the need to relax to attach and get control your breathing and focus on the immediate task and like you can apply that to anything not just a shooting so there's some some real benefits to firearms and then I go on here but firearms are not always available there are many places in the world we're carrying a gun as illegal there are also times where firearms malfunction is also important to know how to defend yourself in on our situations which brings us back to martial arts first let me say that the martial arts are very emotional for some people their martial art becomes their religion and may become blinded by it martial arts are not static they evolve all with they evolve all the time if you do not evolve with them you will be left behind picking one martial art versus another or saying that one martial art is better than another martial art drive some people crazy I do not engage in irrational theoretical discussions on which martial art is best there's no reason to theorize anymore the ultimate fighting championship put many theories to the test the war's an Iraq and Afghanistan also put many theories to the test about hand-to-hand combat finally every person now carries a video camera in their pocket and there are thousands of street fights and confrontations to watch on the internet with all that information readily available there is no need to theorize anymore it is easy to see what works and what doesn't furthermore it is also obvious that martial arts are not stagnant they evolve people develop new techniques and new moves to counter other techniques and other moves but they but the fundamental principles do not change they only become reinforced and I give some advice here start with Brazilian jujitsu it is a form of grappling that is highly advanced because for the most part the actual fighting takes place on the ground this is a key point because our first form of self-defense is to get away yes run if you are confronted by another person or a group of people the best thing you can do is run away avoid the conflict this is relatively easy if someone is trying to strike with you or strike you with punches or kicks they do not have control over you so you can simply run away from them you have one the problem comes in a self-defense situation when someone is grabbing you now they are preventing your first line of defense running as soon as someone grabs you you are in a grappling scenario and one of the most critical parts of Brazilian jujitsu is escaping someone's grip so you can run oftentimes an attacker will take you to the ground in order to prevent you from escaping their grip when this happens the ability to ground fight is used not to stay on the ground but to get up and get away from the attacker the first goal of a beginner in jujitsu is not to get the fight to the ground but to get up off the ground and get away this is an important distinction from people who believe the goal of self-defense in jujitsu is to get the attacker to the ground this is not true the goal is to get away but as has been seen over and over again fights often end up on the ground and therefore a person must be prepared for it not training in jujitsu because you don't want to go to the ground is like not learning to swim because you don't want to go in the water it doesn't make sense the safest way to deal with the water is to be comfortable in it just as being comfortable on the ground is the best way to deal with that scenario should it unfold in real life questions comments from echo trolls i agree we can reach back to your days many days on the front lines of the bouncing one yeah i agree that is yeah i agree i can't disagree at all one of the primary arguments that people give when they you know Brazilian jujitsu is no good for self-defense why would you take someone to the ground why are you taking them around that's not going to run out doing that we're trying to get away yeah so you know i have to like that the muscle when we do the jujitsu part and you notice this and you actually pointed it out which i liked go whatever you where i said if i choose to fight this guy you know how like i'll go through the basic thing when if i come front this guy it's come front for me and i choose to fight them so it's way different than self-defense that's like i chose to fight this person and most of the time you you add in just like i said earlier where if you don't have a choice to run like in the grab your whatever there is that too for sure but yes if you choose to fight them then yeah you can take into a ground whenever now your choice to fight them is going to be based on the bunch of other things and the better be intelligent because if you're like yeah i'm at the club you said this and whatever and then you just you're fighting yeah i don't know if that's and you know uh uh the right choice and now you get a whole different issue then the self-defense situation you know that's like a choice and you made it whatever but yeah if you're you know i don't know fighting with your friend after not your friend but your enemy after school and everyone's like circle i don't know whatever there there's there's choices to be made in if the right choice is to fight the guy and then yes bring the shoes well then yeah so so then you can use jiu jitsu but now you're using it in an offensive situation and so yes you probably will want to take the person to the ground yeah i mean if it's if it's a like a one on one i'm choosing to fight because if it's four on one and you're choosing to fight you're just being stupid yes you're about to get your ass beat yes or yeah the very high likely yes yeah the oh i do have a question about the firearms train like you know how you train in stressful situations what kind of stressful situations can you like put yourself in or whatever uh there's some obvious ones the most obvious one is time constraints so hey i want to get these shots off as quick as possible and i'm competing against you know echo's going against me and we're trying to see who wins there's a little bit of stress there but also hey do 30 burpees and then shoot six head blades right through your breathing hard sprint reload reload drills um this all those things that that there's a million different ways i mean you can i'm sure those were enough to kind of spark your creativity on what you can do to make it stressful yeah fully the time because i went it was the last time i went but i went to the range with keen and cornealious and we did we just did like a simple fun like contest you know kind of like shooting replay horse yeah paper what are you kind of like that kind of situation i mean i actually filmed it but the video kind of got one kill is gonna release it but that that did add a little something because it like if you miss or you would ever it meant something kind of thing but it i didn't i'd never felt i wouldn't label it as a stressful training scenario but time constraints if it's like okay you got time it's trying to get better at it and it's a competition i mean when you're in this year themes you're doing freaking competitive shooting against every i basically all the time you're shooting against somebody where you shoot against three people or four people or whatever so you you you you have that level of stress but then it's also you know you're going to run you're going to run up that berm you're going to drag that tire you're going to come back over here you're going to shoot six head plates you're going to go back you're going to get on your long gun you're going to put down this one you got all these things that you got it and it's all a race and they're just trying to make you freak out and then on top of that you know once you get into the sim unition now you've got you're you're you're not shooting real bullets but you're shooting you got people maneuvering you got people you know you're you're you're throwing flash glass and we got grenades going off like all kinds of mayhem and sim munition is just as loud as loud as it like night and day like night and day yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because that i feel like and obviously i've never been in a straight up gun fight with anyone like they're shooting at me actually that up but i would imagine that just hearing other gunshots going on and you know that they're at you or intended for you whatever that's going to just bring you out of your whole shooting game yeah the noise of gunshots it's like if you hear it a lot less and when you're when you're shooting like at somebody you're nearing the game yeah like it's a lot less a lot less it's not that it's not like the like the like the little shock that you get when you're at the range or whatever okay even even actually if you get you know you get like a good stress scenario going even in a training situation you won't really like notice big time and we used to do our drills this is back in the back in the turn they used to man this is this is i don't recommend it but they would make us do some of our immediate action drills with no your protection in so that we would like quote get used to it yeah but this allow yeah so it and that was something too that else wasn't even worth so if you're in the field straight up or alone you do you have your protection yeah you have well nowadays we have this and this is another thing that's pretty crazy is we have the headsets that are noise canceling headsets and the reason you're wearing them is because you're on the radio so it's it's your headphone for your radio so you can hear and it's a noise canceling headset so when a loud noise goes off it cancels out that noise so so okay so when was the first time you ever shot a gun in my life yeah in your life it's very like eight or nine I think maybe ten yeah something else they got to go to younger than ten but I was I was up in Maine and I went out to my friend was a little older than me we went out to his uncle's farm and shot yeah so the so you weren't like surprised by how freaking loud a gun is then no but I think I think what you're getting at is people that I don't really remember enough of like my introduction of firearms to get what you're getting at which is firearms are freaking loud way louder than anything they could portray in the movies or whatever yeah hundred percent yeah because that it just look again I've never been in a firefight but it just seems like when you imagine it where when it kicks off and you didn't kick it off with a first shot if someone else shot by the first shot seems like you just be out of the game if you're not used to it yeah well you definitely that's another thing is you get so used to gunshots in the seal teams from your training that that doesn't really like it's not a shock anymore yeah so a costume here it's not it's not shocking it's like oh yeah that's true oh where's that coming from right yeah even like when you're also the distance you know when someone's a little bit further away from you the the shock is a lot less when you get away from it you know thanks the the the concussion of the shot yeah now if they're in the same room as you it can be pretty pretty dynamic right we should ask Mike Day oh yeah how that gonna yeah man yeah it's crazy like when okay so when you go to the gun range let's say you know it's your first time or whatever the gun range when you walk in that door and you hear other people shooting your like yeah okay so have you shot outdoors yet yeah yeah okay because it's a lot different shooting outdoors in indoors yeah a lot different yeah yeah I don't think I even it was actually the first time I shot a gun think one of the early times anyway was was outdoors and I don't think we even had your protection and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we were shooting like some louder ones okay 45 shot done for we're shooting clay clay pigeons or whatever um and yeah I remember them being loud like for real loud even outdoors but compared to indoors it's it was nothing because if you don't wear your protection like at the regular indoor gun range like but you might know issues yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure but it's good to condition it's good to stress condition it's good to get used to those noise it's good to get used to all those things this is well there's what we train for and we should not just relegate training to just being in the military we should train for you know other things that can happen in life and if you are gonna have a fire I'm damn well better trained with it um going back to the jiu-jitsu thing I want to read this other little section another reason I recommend starting martial arts by learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu is because it is the most complex of the martial arts although there is a finite number of moves and positions there is an infinite number of moves beyond the basics and more developed every day in this constantly evolving art due to this unending depth in jiu-jitsu it is also the most cerebral of martial arts it provides incredible mental stimulus and a never-ending challenge to learn develop and improve jiu-jitsu never gets old the next martial art I recommend is learning boxing boxing is an incredibly effective striking art despite its relative simplicity there are only two weapons in boxing the whole f-tand in the right hand but with those two weapons and incredible advantage can be gained if you know how to throw them in effective combinations other critical elements learned in boxing our angles movement both of which are based heavily on fortwork and speed which are utilized in both both the offense and defense of boxing with basic boxing knowledge a person can throw effective punches and avoid being punched both extremely useful assets when attempting to attempt the primary goal of self defense run boxing develops the ability to hit quickly avoid being hit and run away from the area of confrontation so that's just regular western boxing and this is sort of like again this is my recommendation if you're starting from ground zero you know nothing this is how I would go about it there can be some argument made that if you were going to a place tomorrow that you needed to be ready to begin attacked then maybe like you look at some other form of martial arts but if that's your situation like it's not smart I mean and you know by that I mean some of these I don't even know if that's a true statement yeah I mean it's what I think it might be I think it is one of the statements where it just straight up depends so depends on what what do you mean you're going to be attacked like just by a person and is that person be trained or not untrained or they be bigger than you or they can be equal sized of you know or smaller or weapons or yeah and then it depends on who like okay you might learn you know and what is it like okay you might need these these kind of blitz martial arts type situation like a crowd from a god you know or whatever whatever some cool system I think I would in a read actually told me that I think in a read was like you know if you had like one day I would teach somebody some basic crowd from a god stuff yeah and and that could be true for sure if you know if the the instructors teaching you for that reason yeah you just got one day let's pack it in or and then even a jujitsu scenario here's a problem of that statement now that I think through it in my opinion the problem of that statement is if you really think that that one day is going to help you you're an idiot yeah like if I be the best you could do but it only going to give you a 1% better chance than you know so don't get yourself in that situation that's why you make martial arts a part of your life yeah it's it's got to be a life thing yeah but the thing is that is a thing though where like even Tim Ferriss sort of studies it a little bit remember like because he took a thing a jujitsu thing where he was like hey I need to know that the most that I possibly can to be affected in the small short of this was like a TV show right it was yeah I was like one of the things yeah and I was like oh that's an interesting theory because that's not the way you change a jujitsu at all and you know they taught him like the guillotine was one of them that they taught because there's not all these like factors you have to kind of establish before you can execute to move or not as many or whatever that was kind of the thing and anyway the point is it introduced like an interesting approach to these things this real short term approach how can I get the most effectiveness out of it if I only have a short amount of time rather than infinite time you know so yeah yeah that's cool because you could also that that would be it be if you made if someone said I'm gonna go to this place tomorrow and there's a high likelihood I got attacked I would be taking I would I would be taking very small parts of various martial arts yeah that's what I think I would do but again I don't want to make that sound like its a solution because I don't want to sound like the freaking magazines to say defeat any attack and move to three moves it's a lie straight up it's a lie straight up don't think of it that way don't even forget I just said that here's the deal make martial arts a part of your life that's what you need to do back to the book the next two martial arts to invest time into our Moitai and wrestling they both add a plethora of options and skills to any fighter wrestling wrestling is a grappling art perhaps the most widely known in practice look I go through a bunch of stuff and I talk about Moitai and Moitai is awesome I think the reason that I put that I would train someone in boxing first before Moitai is just for the complexities like Moitai is just that much more complex you can throw out both you can throw knees you can throw kicks there's a lot more things to learn so the first thing I want to learn is how to throw hands you know how to throw hands get head movement get angles work distance like that's all going to come from just boxing without opening up because look I mean Moitai is savage bro Moitai is savage yeah that's one of the pain that's what I was going to say like that's what you get taught as well and not like a secondary teaching like one of the primary thinking is like kind of how fragile you are with pain where the kind of like okay or how much you can get used to it too exactly right that's part of the training you know that's what you do benefit from taking that pain like ribs legs is a huge one man like a leg kick body kick punch even when you kick somebody and it lands in the wrong spot but it's like hurts it's it's worse than most hits that you get like if you get punched in the face let's face it I mean it seems crazy whatever but it doesn't hurt that much even if you really get a good one it more knocks you like dizzy more than it actually is pain Moitai is straight up pain in a way sometimes you kind of wish you'd stop punching me below the freaking net or kicking one of just punch me in the face that's way better way more is really really you know sometimes but yeah you get used to that and that kind of training is very beneficial because men you kick even in like a real fighter whatever you give if you can effectively like leg kick somebody two even three times or something like this and they feel that pain like bro I want to watch the guy you're like oh you don't know like I got kicked on like you think no big deal you don't know no here actually I was like trying to think what I said Moitai adds a massive arsenal of striking options to a fighter where boxing utilize is only two fists Moitai utilize his fist elbows knees and the shins in very aggressive combinations that are absolutely devastating in a fight Moitai is also about pain and the ability to withstand pain legit talk about shame conditioning in there so definitely look Moitai awesome wrestling clearly is just freaking awesome um wrestling is a grappling art the physical grind of wrestling hardens the body and mind without mercy on top of the conditioning and mental toughness derived from wrestling it is also the king of position in martial arts and we see this from the UFC this is why the rest of us dominate in the UFC meaning a good wrestler can decide what position they will be in during a competition no other martial art provides a practitioner a better ability to dictate the position of a fight with one simple idea the main focus of wrestling is to get the opponent to the ground and keep them there so then I say once a good base is and again there's a bunch of details on wrestling on Moitai on boxing once a good base is established in Brazilian institutes boxing wrestling and Moitai there are plenty of other martial arts to explore judo is a fantastic art and has very effective take down especially against opponent wearing a jacket or shirt sombo what talk about krav maga i talk about screaming kali and the dog brothers you know dog brothers vaguely yes the dog brothers are legit about as legit as it gets a they and they've been around for a long time but for those of you that don't know the dog brothers they would have these fights with weapons and basically you would wear the guys would wear like lacrosse gloves i guess to protect their fingers and they would wear some kind of like hockey helmet to protect their heads and then they would use various weapons they would use sticks they would use chains they would use canes just all and they would go at it like they would fight like they would fight and you could tap out but they were gonna fight you were gonna get hit and you can go watch those videos of dog brothers but what was cool about is they may be around for a very long time and it was the most realistic you know it's the most realistic weapons fighting i think that that that i've seen and and then they would try and learn from it and all that so very cool stuff that they taught and trained in and then i say the list you go on and on there's there's no reason to ever stop training in learning martial arts of course it is good to be prepared to handle a self defense situation but the benefits of martial arts training go far beyond self defense of course you get physically conditioned you also get mentally tougher real martial arts are hard they they are a mental and physical grind if the martial art you are training in as easy it isn't likely doing much good martial arts also get you used to being a non comfortable situations and continuing to fight on this is an important in any endeavor martial arts will make you better so train don't think about it don't take time to get in shape before you start just go start the rest will come and then i have a whole section in here about where to train what type of academy what are you looking for thank god the world is improving where this jujitsu everywhere now look we're gonna get through this COVID thing here shortly and all the jujitsu jams will be back open have a section in here on a immediate action drills facing a threat so i'm like talking about what you actually do when bad things are happening you know we get mass shooting situations we got all kinds of problems out there and you know I wanted to talk about how you handle those situations the next section by the hit every controversial the next section is called feeding the machine and the first section in here and by the way you know everyone's gonna comment about you know it's funny is like people comment you know we've had some some excerpts put out from us talking about martial arts and there's people that would say would call out certain things now read through the comments and oh yeah that's well that's actually accurate i i shouldn't have said that right i didn't mention that or whatever so if you're gonna get all ham if you get all ham in the comments go for it and uh we'll maybe we'll address them on the grounded podcast but um some good points are made in there and like i said these are these are if if you consider your martial art a religion and something that i said i tacked your religion if you're a diehard mojtai and you think that i'm saying that jujitsu is better you know like and you want to bring it i'm sorry i mean it's just this is my thoughts you can disagree that's cool mojtai is awesome wrestling is awesome boxing is awesome you jujitsu is awesome i love them all train them all it's all good but it's controversial for some people yes some people it's a religion if you gotta be careful that so when talking about fuel like what we are going to eat this is another thing that can become you know kind of controversial and people get crazy on i got a section here says addicted to sugar sugar is truly addictive it stimulates the same parts of the brain as heroin and cocaine when you have it you want more of it and you know this to be true that's why you can't stop eating it and when you do stop eating it you will feel with troll headache irritation anxiety lies the lies will come and they will come from you the lies you tell yourself are it's no big deal i can just have a little it isn't worth it to feel this bad the body needs carbs you will rationalize and start to listen to lies don't stay strong get off the sugar train get off the addiction stop eating sugar cocaine and heroin people don't you know what the rat's eat ah fuel look i talk about i talk about what to eat and again this is a religion for some people for a lot of people it's a religion i kind of you know hey here's what i think here's what i eat you know i eat these things beef poultry fish eggs not subedged the pulse fungi roots some dairy limited fruits are you want to get crazy on that cool you want to attack me cool kind of fungi your mushrooms I guess and ringworm I guess i'll have a double ringworm sandwich please uh don't eat these grains potatoes refined salt refined sugar processed oils right so it's just basic stuff let's not get crazy um fasting talk about fasting this section starts off news flash you don't have to eat fasting is a gift actually my dot my resting my middle daughter of that Russell she told me she would think about this because when she would be cutting weight she'd be thinking she would think but i talk about in here you know the human body can live for a long time here we go humans can survive 30 days without food you can make it in extra few hours you can actually make it a few days without any issue i fast 24 hours regularly i do 72 hours fast approximately every three months and you know what they aren't that big of a deal when i'm fasting i still do everything i would normally do if i were eating i would work out i train you did to i drink water some tea maybe eat some sunflower seeds poop freak you're not fasting you ate a sunflower seed that's what i do like take it easy uh so i have something to chew on but fasting isn't that hard and you will feel better at the end of it this is my favorite thing fasting will recalibrate what hunger is to you you'll realize that you aren't actually hungry most of the time you're just bored and at the end of a fast your food will taste better too that is a factual beautiful thing food tastes good when you uh when you do that so a whole section on fasting a bunch of benefits from that got a section here dealing with injuries and illness you are going to get injured you are going to get sick regardless of how careful you are in training you how clean you eat and how healthy you live you are still human injuries and illness will occur my theory for overcoming injuries and illness is simple do what you can if you're sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip or workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can hurt your knee work your upper body work the good leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm pull up some pushups focus on your core and legs until your shoulder heals up 10 to 90s from using your grip too much sounds like it's time to focus on sprinting and jumping the plyometrics got a little cold flu same thing do what you can maybe it's just going for a walk a couple sets of situps and pushups but don't just stay in bed all day now sometimes you get playing knocked out by illness or a virus if it is that bad and your body absolutely needs rest good listen to your body and take the rest also don't bring your disease to the gym and spread it around work out at home same thing with injuries if some injury prevents you from doing the physical things you like to do good do what you can work on some skills you can do pick up a guitar write a book draw paint compose a song blog create learn do something take advantage of physical injuries and sickness by doing something you don't normally have time for in other words get after it and I recently did that when I got COVID I was like oh cool I can't I can't literally leave my house apparently not supposed to interact with anybody so and everybody kind of knew I had it so it's cool and I just like playing guitar a bunch and started digging into all bunch I've been I've been playing guitar for 35 years and I've been at the same level for about 34 and half years and in the past two weeks I've advanced 10 fold on my understanding so this isn't just me saying this is actually something to do more you do that to the more you get used to that protocol you know where you know how like sometimes like your workouts or your whatever is like that's like your main jam like and then you get hurt and then you're all you know you can get depressed or just be so unhappy that you're out of game can't change you get to and people get awful but if you're used to that protocol where it's like it essentially opens up opportunity for new developments and growth you know for yourself literally making you a better person right so that becomes a protocol a normal protocol when you get injured it's automatic you're like okay I'm injured hey whatever junk but whatever and then this protocol kind of ensues and then boom you're kind of like you're kind of into that for a little bit yeah because getting injured it's for people like you for people like me that are really like do physical stuff getting injured is so horrible but I I will say I have this protocol when I'm like a cool when I when I do remember when I heard my elbow like Dean from the bank in my elbow I mean I was in a sling I've never been to sling in my life but like the next day or maybe it was one day later like at first I couldn't even do anything but then I was in doing one arm kettlebell swing snatches and stuff else like okay cool what you're gonna work through this it'll get better over time that's what's gonna take but whatever it's like a cut like even couldn't play guitar though damn pro brutal the initiating like the the first thing you do is essentially see what you can do and can't do and then from there you just go forward where it's like yeah you do what you can physically but we know that's not kind of it's hard to be like mentally on that same level as far as like your enthusiasm to pursue work out surgery, get through whatever when you're just doing what you can do especially if it's a significant injury but if you can do this other stuff now you know you can focus on other stuff or whatever you have like yeah and you just gonna mission who you are in your mission you mission you mission straight up there's a whole section like I said appendix is just all kinds of workouts from beginner workouts that literally any human being can do to advance workouts that will crush whoever and they're all written down in there and then well let me just read the last page of this book let's give it away the spoiler the section called do and it says don't just read this book don't just listen to the podcast don't just watch videos online don't just take notes don't just study them don't just share them with your friends don't just plan don't just mark your calendar don't just get motivated don't just talk don't just think don't just dream no none of that matters the only thing that matters is that you actually do so do and there you go that's that's the book and you know I think that this book obviously as I started off this book is something that anyone can use it something that I actually use something that I have used in dire situations to help me and something I use on a daily situation to help me something that something that we could all use to look at to remind us to keep us on the path it's a very present sense of message do you like that it's very present sense of message yeah I do like that thank you just there looking at you sending a message and the message is disappointing was freedom so get after it so echo we we want to get after it do you have any recommendations on how we do that or how we can keep doing that. this book is like the ultimate like New Year's book you know people they'll make like the New Year's Resolution you know but usually because you know how they say like a lot of most whatever I don't know that number like resolutions they'll fail after whatever amount of times. yeah something's something yeah but think when you think about it when you have the manual you don't have to it doesn't have to fail like you just refer to the manual it's a you know it's a thing rather than let's face it it was like when you make a New Year's Resolution it's kind of like oh I just sort of intend to get in shape you don't have a path on the plan of full action you know you just have an intention boom you got it right there you know so one of those things in fact I would argue that if you're like okay this is my kind of like I was saying with the owners manual of a car if you just if you have this and you treat it as your owner's manual for your New Year's Resolution or for your life in general it should be for your life in general yes but I'm saying if you want to slide it in and have it serve that particular purpose how are the moment I like you know what I think is cool is giving it this on one give the gift of discipline give the gift of discipline just make me wish freedom field manual Markorn motto oh by the way the name of this is Markorn motto that's from the military term it's when they modify things here so the mark one is like this is the first model of it then mod one is the first modification the first mod that they make so there's a modification to this one my head is bigger on the cover yeah that's the mod right there wait wait wait wait wait what is Mark one what is Mark one is it's like a model number yeah but they just call them mark yeah it's in the Navy yeah well it's in cameras as well so you got the cannon so cannon 5D mark I'm going to the one for the have Mark one okay so cannon 5D Mark one then this Mark two and then this Mark three got it yeah so they could have said Mark one and if they made like small changes to it probably mod one if they did like a full revamp then it's Mark two yeah so you could get you know a weapon system sure that it is the mark one it's the but then they add a new front sight to it you're like okay this Mark one mod one still one they add a new rear sight and it's like oh Mark one mod two so you can keep doing that so this this field manual and what's cool I will say I have a lot of what is it creative control so my publisher I said yes gonna be Mark one mod one that what's there like they didn't have any idea what this is I might as well say they're Google Blue they're like they're not like you wouldn't talk about but they're going yeah so credit it does sound cool Mark one mod one yeah well I'm glad you think it sounds cool better than Google Blue is tactical but the Mark okay so you you would actually not to spend go too deep on this Mark one mod one ummm workings but okay so what what's it because you said the guns before something Mark one like what which gun no we don't the guns are actually army weapons some markers from like the navy yeah but you like what was the okay what machine gun did you hear why can't we have four M4 there you go that was the one yeah the army it's just M though it's not Mark also M4 is Mark 4 no no M4 is the gun and then it's Mark one no they don't even do it with guns it's like a more of a navy term good yeah well they do it with camera straight out I have a boat called the Mark 5 okay all right well I'm gonna leave that to the navy and the weapon system scenario and cameras by the way because I don't know if I have grasp on it yet but I'll tell you what I do have a grasp on it's how we can all stay stay on the path or get on the path if you not on the path already when you're on the path you're gonna find out that it's hard it's not always easy it's actually not even always hard technically but it does get hard from time to time sometimes you need assistance sometimes you need supplementation and it's true jocquoise has us covered jocquoise fuel okay so if your if your joints are in need of supplementation with that joint supplements joint warfare what's called first one super krill oil it's the second one for your joints but we want to blend into immunity stuff we got vitamin D three also cold war boom joints immunity covered don't even think about those anymore put that into your daily discipline routine every morning or every night whatever boom you don't got to worry about that can stuff anymore also discipline and discipline go now this is a cognitive supplement similar to what sleep does really you talked about brain derived new tropic factor number 99 or whatever you're saying it's kind of the same thing this is number 100 mark mark 100 over here either way it's kind of the same thing really yeah 100% bro that's coming up even some hardcore bro science I hit you with bro science today they're coming back and I like it and it's part of the game so part of the game nonetheless so discipline discipline go you know enhance your mind helps your cognitive abilities and physical abilities by the way many different modes that you um was a term you I'll get you primed right now which is the word you said I primed sir get the cognitive physical mental priming going on get your get a can of discipline go get the get the pill get the powder so before workouts I like the powder for that priming effect because there's there's regular priming and then there's like the secondary priming effect maybe or maybe more accurately put the psychological priming effect because you mix up the little discipline mix mega mix whatever mix it up and when you're drinking it it's like your mind is just just just getting ready psychologically not to mention all the physiological benefits you can say so it's like one on top of the other anyway it's part of the game but if you want to replace your current energy drink problem that's what it is. It's not even potentially it's a problem if you're drinking energy drinks normal energy it's a problem it's a problem because you're gonna sugar you're getting an overdose of caffeine you're gonna punch a chemicals in there that they use to preserve but there's like it's it's a absolutely it's a problem. Yeah okay I was gonna talk about this you know I'm gonna do it I'm gonna talk about it so anyway my kids watch this show I think it's called the victorious yes this show you'll never know this show ever yep I know you're young as daughter might actually watch it you said I will never know it and I said yes I will not I may not know you might over here it or what anyway it's kind of funny little show called victorious uh Ariana Grande's in it and Tor Tori don't look at me for help you know you know Tori's anyway they're from anyway um and so here's here's the thing here's an issue with all there not the issues are complex story kind of I'm trying to remember why you've been brought up but okay okay this is why so so my every time there's like a brand in there they go real odd they do a good job but it's real obvious what brand they're portraying but it's okay okay they'll have an apple computer but and it looks like an apple computer but instead of an apple it's a pair yeah so like instead of like AirPods they'll have a pair pods you know like it's real obvious right they do that with the brands they'll have a generic version of the brand just it can throw out the show right one episode there this one was actually a kind of like a little political episode almost a little freedom situation so they had this drink you soda called blue dog blue dog drink and then a guy from the FBI the federal bureau of interference came in and said hey we're getting rid of all it's we're banning it prohibition style we're taking off all the shelves and all the kids wage and before they wage this campaigning and hey it's that if it's freedom you know like people you know you shouldn't ban it for everyone just as certain people can't make choices whatever but what they did was they started making their own knockoff red dog soda and then they got busted and then anyway it was a thing right here's the thing here's a point I hope so we know what red or not red dog sorry blue dog you know what brand they're portraying yes I think that's pretty probably some energy drinks scenario is going on right that's what they're talking about so with our current in real life energy drinks scenario hey we have the freedom to drink whatever we want to drink but I think it would benefit everyone including yourself to make the right choice with that freedom now if energy drinks are your weakness hey that's no problem now now it's not a problem you just switch over to the discipline go in and can so it feels all that good energy drink right curie and there's not many but it fulfills all of them which is you get some energy from it but now instead of killing yourself in the same time literally by the way slowly literally you're helping yourself and improving your health well I would love to add something to this but no one's listening anymore I think that's how they will just go and figure us out oh yeah you can get this stuff at origin main dot com you can get this stuff at the vitamin shop you can get this stuff out you can get the drinks out wall wall by the way we'll be alive in wall wall whole east coast every store January 4th epic that's due in large part two troopers
