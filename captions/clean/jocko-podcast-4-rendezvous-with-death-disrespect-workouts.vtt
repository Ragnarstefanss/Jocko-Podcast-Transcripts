00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number four with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So several years ago, I was at the UFC.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I've been to a lot of UFC's, love going to watch UFC's, and I've been to, I don't even know how many, but it's many.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many times I was there with fighters that I trained, cornering them, or with fighters that I trained with, and I was watching them.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I've been to a lot of UFC's, and this one in particular, I don't remember, I don't even remember which fight it was, and who was fighting, or who I was coaching, or whatever.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But my work for the night, it was done.

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And so now it was time to kind of sit back and relax and watch the rest of the fights, and I actually linked up with one of my good seal friends.

9
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Who I was in Ramaday with.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we were sitting there having a good time. This is post-Ramaday.

11
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I think this is around 2007, 2008, so we've been home for a year or two.

12
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And we're sitting there watching and enjoying, and all of a sudden, in the arena that we were in,

13
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.000
there's big giant screens, and the UFC plays various advertisements in between fights.

14
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And normally there's some noise, and there's background, and there's people who kind of continue with what they're doing.

15
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
For whatever reason this advertisement came on, and it captured everyone's attention, not just mine.

16
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So we're sitting there in all of a sudden kind of everyone was sort of captivated by this advertisement that came up on the screen.

17
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And it was a commercial for a video game, and I'm not a video game player, and I just don't know much about video games.

18
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But the video game was called Gears of War. And the commercial was right here.

19
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And if you're watching this on YouTube, we're going to have to send you to the link, because we don't want to interfere with the rights of the commercial.

20
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So we'll put that in the link on YouTube, but it's a Gears of War. If you type in a YouTube, Gears of War, Rondevue of Death, Rondevue with Death, you will see this commercial.

21
00:02:41.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Honestly, as I see this, I'm kind of surprised or shocked, and maybe even a little bit embarrassed, because something about that commercial hit me in a way that I didn't think that some Hollywood video game commercial producer should be able to do.

22
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I felt like that shouldn't be able to happen. And I don't feel like that very often.

23
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And so when the fights were over, and I got back to my hotel room, and when I got there, I was still thinking about this. I was still thinking about this commercial that I saw.

24
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And so I opened up my computer, and I googled Rondevue with Death, and sure enough, there it was, not the video game commercial, but a poem, a real poem that was written by a real poet, who was a real warrior.

25
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I did some research on him. It turns out this guy that wrote this poem.

26
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It was named Alan Seeger. He was born in 1888, raised in Staten Island, New York, had a privileged upbringing, went to private schools, ended up going to college at Harvard. He was classmates with TS Eliot, so he was kind of surrounded by very important and influential people.

27
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And when he graduated from Harvard, he went to Paris, and from what I can tell, he wanted to kind of continue this lifestyle of an artist or of a poet.

28
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And while he was in Paris, World War I broke out, and on August 24, 1914, Alan Seeger joined the French Foreign Legion.

29
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
He wrote, in a letter to his mom, about this move.

30
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I hope you see the thing I do, and think that I have done well, being without responsibilities and with no one to suffer materially from my decision.

31
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:36.000
In taking upon my shoulders, too, the burden that so much of humanity is suffering under, and rather than stand engloriously aside, when the opportunity was given me, doing my share for the side that I think right.

32
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So this young guy goes off, and he actually wrote a bunch of letters home, and he kept a journal as well, which is very interesting, and perhaps that will become one of our future topics on this podcast.

33
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But the poem, which is called rendezvous, actually is a little bit longer than what they put in the commercial, and we read the full poem, again written by Alan Seeger, and here it is rendezvous.

34
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I have a rendezvous with death. At some disputed barricade, when spring comes back with rustling shade and apple blossoms fill the air, I have a rendezvous with death.

35
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
When spring brings back blue days and fair.

36
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It may be he shall take my hand and lead me into his dark land and close my eyes and quench my breath. It may be I shall pass him still. I have a rendezvous with death.

37
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:20.000
On some scarred slope of battered hill, when spring comes round again this year, and the first metal flowers appear. God knows it's for better to be deep, pillowed and silk and sent it down, where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath, where hushed awakenings are dear.

38
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But I have a rendezvous with death. At midnight in some flaming town, when spring trips north again this year, and I to my pledged word am true.

39
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I shall not fail that rendezvous. And he did not fail that rendezvous. Alan Seeger was killed in action.

40
00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:12.000
July 5, 1916, as he in his unit successfully charged, the heavily fortified French village in France, called Beloy and Suntare, who is during a tactical assault, one of the small fights in what became known as the Battle of the Somme,

41
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:28.000
which resulted in 420,000 British casualties, 200,000 French casualties, and 500,000 German casualties from one battle.

42
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Talking a little bit about how he died, this is from a friend of Seeger that was with him during the attack.

43
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
About 4 o'clock, the order came to get ready for the attack. None could help thinking of what the next few hours were bring.

44
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
One minute to anguish, and then, once in the ranks, faces became calm and serene, a kind of gravity falling upon them.

45
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
While on each could be read the determination and expectation of victory.

46
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Two battalions were to attack our company being the reserve of battalion. The company's forming the first wave were deployed on the plane.

47
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Bayonette's glittered in the air above the corn. All ready quite tall.

48
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The first section, which was Alan Sechon, formed the right and then guard of the company and mine formed the left wing.

49
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.000
After the first bound forward, we lay for a flat on the ground, and I saw the first section advancing beyond us and making toward the extreme right of the village.

50
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I caught sight of Seeger and called to him, making a sign with my hand.

51
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
He answered with a smile.

52
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:54.000
How pale he was, his tall silhouette stood out on the green of the cornfield. He was the tallest man in his section. His head erect and pride in his eyes.

53
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I saw him running forward with Bayonette fixed. Soon he disappeared, and that was the last time I saw my friend.

54
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That's an excerpt from John Keegan's face of war.

55
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So Seeger was shot in the stomach, and while he bled to death, he reportedly continued to encourage his fellow soldiers to press on.

56
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:35.000
He was posthumously awarded the French Cross of War, and the military medal, and like many, many soldiers, especially ones from World War I.

57
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
He was buried in a mass grave.

58
00:10:41.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, the reason I started off today talking about Alan Seeger is because I wanted to talk about World War I, and I often tell my son that World War I is the one war that I was in.

59
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I was just completely savage and brutal, and if you haven't listened to Blueprint for Armageddon on Hardcore history, which is an absolutely phenomenal podcast.

60
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But if you haven't listened to that, listen to it, it will give you a good oversight of the war.

61
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But what really disturbs me about World War I and what scares me about World War I is that you had very, very limited control over your destiny.

62
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.000
You could not use your brain and your tactical prowess and your skills to keep you alive.

63
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
You know, if you watch any footage of World War I, it was listen.

64
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
There's the we're in our trench, there in their trench.

65
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
At this designated time, we are going to get up, and we are going to go over the top, and we are going to charge.

66
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it was just absolutely brutal, brutal warfare.

67
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Now, that is kind of what brings us to a book that I wanted to talk a little bit about today.

68
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And this book is a very quick read, it's a very interesting read.

69
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I looked for it on Amazon, it's, I think it's available in some digital version.

70
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It's also available for free.

71
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If you just Google this book for free, you can find it.

72
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It is called Battle Leadership.

73
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And it's by a guy named Captain Adolf Vaunchel, who was in the German army.

74
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And to give you a little information on Captain Vaunchel and why he has this sort of phenomenal insight into war.

75
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Let me tell you a little bit about him, this is from the forward of the book.

76
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
He entered the Imperial German army, a few years prior to the outbreak of World War of the World War.

77
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So this was written in the 30s when there was no Second World War.

78
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The mobilization in 1914 found him on the Belgian frontier in command of an infantry platoon.

79
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
In October 1914, he took part in several battles which occurred during the historic race to the sea.

80
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And again, if you watch hard to go, if you listen to hard court history, you will hear all about that.

81
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
In one of these, he received the first of several wounds.

82
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The World War was to bring him.

83
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And he was sent home.

84
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
In February of 1915, he returned to duty.

85
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And he was a company commander.

86
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
There, under Hindenburg, his company marched and fought in meter deep snow and series of engagements known historically as the Winter Battles.

87
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Of the Missouri and Lakes, in which over 100,000 prisoners were taken.

88
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
From July to October, the same year he took part in the gigantic, Austro-German assault of the Polish salient, which was climaxed by the fall of Warsaw.

89
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Following this, the German drive to the east was carried, carried the young officer in Russia as far as the Burzina River.

90
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000
This summer, filled with endless marches and repeated engagements, gave him a wide experience in the open warfare tactics of small units.

91
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:12.000
In 1916, in 1916, Captain von Schel still in the east operating close conjunction with the Austrians in an effort to stop the Brousalov steam roller.

92
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In 1970, his division was transferred to the Romanian front where von Schel took part in a number of engagements in the higher altitude of the Carpathians.

93
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000
In 1918, the war carried the author into its bypass, the Ukraine, the Crimea, and the Caucasus.

94
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
The armorses found him operating against the Bolsheviks.

95
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
After the war was over, he stayed in the army. He was in all kinds of different positions as he stayed.

96
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:59.000
He ended up actually in the after World War I. He came to America and went to Fort Benning, Georgia and went through airborne school, which is an American army school.

97
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:08.000
This is where this volume, this information developed from, because while he was going through airborne school, he taught a bunch of classes.

98
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
The reason he was selected to teach all these classes is summarized pretty well again in the forward from the book.

99
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
There is probably no officer in our army who is participated in so many widely varying types of military operations as Captain von Schel.

100
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:36.000
His knowledge of war was gained firsthand in meeting engagements, advanced guard battles, rear guard actions, night attacks, guerilla warfare, mountain fighting, in which he took part.

101
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He has run the entire gamut of tactical experience, from pursuit to withdraw, from an assault on permanent fortifications to a major offensive in the rigors of a Russian winter.

102
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
There is no page of his story as set forth in these lectures that is not worthy of study by American officers.

103
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And I will say this.

104
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Yes, he is extremely experienced.

105
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I mean, just an incredible amount of battle experience, especially in World War I, where the casually rate was so absolutely crazy.

106
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:33.000
But also, and perhaps more importantly, and you'll see this as soon as we get into his writings, is he had an incredible mind for war and an incredible mind for leadership.

107
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And I think that is what makes it.

108
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Makes him so impressive and what makes this writing so important. And right out of the gate.

109
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
The first chapter by this guy who again, he's this guy that's done.

110
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Been all this war fair, he's done raids and assaults and defenses. He's done all these things.

111
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:06.000
All these tactical things. And the first chapter is called battlefield psychology.

112
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So he's not talking about the tactics and how to fight and how to maneuver. He's talking about battlefield psychology.

113
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
What does he mean by that?

114
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
From the book here.

115
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Psychology, as I understand it, means knowledge of the soul.

116
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Yet, how shall we speak about the soul of others when we do not even know our own?

117
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Is there a single one of us who can say with certainty how he will react to some given event?

118
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Nevertheless, as leaders, we must have some knowledge of the souls of our soldiers.

119
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Because the soldier, the living man, is the instrument with which we have to work with in war.

120
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So this is something going back to when I got interviewed by Tim Ferriss.

121
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And he asked me what was the most complex operation you were ever in charge of?

122
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And my answer was, look, the operations themselves aren't that complex.

123
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
The complex thing about being a combat leader is dealing with human beings.

124
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And that was clearly what Von Schel thought as well.

125
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Back to the book, the great commanders of all times had a real knowledge of the souls of their soldiers.

126
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Let us use a more simple phrase and call this knowledge of the soul, knowledge of men.

127
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Knowledge of men in all wars has proved an important factor to the leader.

128
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It is probable that this will be still more true in future wars.

129
00:19:50.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And I am here to attest 100 years later that knowledge of the soul of your soldiers is still the most important thing to understand as a leader.

130
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
This is interesting.

131
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Now he's going to get into why this increased in importance during World War I.

132
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Prior to the World War, all armies fought in comparatively close order.

133
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000
So this is when you go back to watching the red coats fight and they're all lined up or you watch brave heart and everyone's lined up.

134
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Or any of those, the failings back in the day, how the Spartans fought, everyone had this, you know, you were at close order.

135
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
You were close to your teammates, your fellow soldiers.

136
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
The psychological reaction of the individual soldier was not so decisive since the fighting was done not by the individual but by mass.

137
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And the mass was held together by drill and discipline.

138
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So you had these very closely, literally close together organizations.

139
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And I would tell you that even in combat today, when you get your group mustard together, let's say in the ground floor of a building.

140
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And I have 40 seals in there and if you hear me talk about decentralized command, I'll tell you, hey, can I control 40 seals on the battlefield? No, absolutely not.

141
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That being said, you put everyone in a small ground floor of a building and I can yell out, hey everyone, mustard here.

142
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
We're going to break out in three minutes, get a good headcount, check your ammo.

143
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Everyone can hear that. You can kind of control them when they're in that close proximity for at least 30 seconds. You can get some control.

144
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So he goes on to talk about that, but more importantly, he says, more over the psychological impressions of battle were simpler.

145
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Rifle and cannon ruled the battlefield and the enemy could be seen.

146
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
In modern war, the impressions are much more powerful.

147
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Usually we fight against an enemy we cannot see. The machine rules the battlefield. We no longer fight in great masses, but in small groups often as individuals.

148
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Therefore, the psychological reaction of the individual has become increasingly important.

149
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:26.000
So again, if you've got all your people mustard together, then you can verbally talk to them and they can see you and you can set that example and you can lead them through physical,

150
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000
physical contact. It's a little easier to overcome whatever psychological barriers they might have.

151
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
When they start getting spread out and all of a sudden they can't hear everything and they can't see you anymore.

152
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Now the psychological element becomes a lot more important.

153
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:55.000
As commanders, we must know the probable reaction of the individual and the means by which we can influence this reaction.

154
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
The knowledge of men is especially difficult for two reasons.

155
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
First, because it cannot be learned from books.

156
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And that is one that I know drives people crazy and it drives me crazy.

157
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And also he will go and kind of reverse that a little bit because he does talk about how military men should study history because you do learn what to expect.

158
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
But to say that knowledge of men is especially difficult for two reasons.

159
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
First, it cannot be learned from books.

160
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.000
And I think we've all seen that. You know, when you get somebody that's been through some kind of a leadership academy and they try and do this.

161
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Dr. Analyzed book.

162
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Solution for something and they fail with it.

163
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Second, because the characteristics of the individual in peace are completely changed in war.

164
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Now, I agree with him on this with a caveat because he's saying that the way men react in war is completely different from the way they react in peace.

165
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And I would venture to guess that if he was alive and I was to have this discussion with him, he would agree with what I'm about to say.

166
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
It is not that the reactions are completely changed.

167
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
It is just that the reactions are amplified and intensified.

168
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
And that is something that Laef and I talk about all the time.

169
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
When people ask us about in civilian companies, you know, it's different because it's not combat and we say combat is like life.

170
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
It's just amplified and intensified.

171
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:49.000
So when you have some business leader that's nervous about making a decision because they might lose a bunch of capital or set the company up for a, you know, a bad quarter or whatever.

172
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And that's real. That's real emotion. It's real fear. It's real hesitation.

173
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
All you do in combat, you put somebody to combat leadership position.

174
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
And they have to make a decision where it could cost someone their lives or could cost them, cause mission failure.

175
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
It's the same emotions, but it's just amplified.

176
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And I think that I think that Von Schell would agree with me.

177
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
If he heard that explanation, I think occasionally you get at the top end of intensity.

178
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:30.000
You do get some other emotions. You know, you get people to freeze, but then again, I see people in the business world that freeze when things get too complex or too crazy.

179
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
And they become paralyzed and they don't make a decision because they're too scared.

180
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:44.000
So actually, I would stick to my guns on this and say that the reactions although different, they're the same reactions they're just amplified.

181
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
He goes on. Man reacts differently in war than he does in peace.

182
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Therefore, he must be handled differently.

183
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.000
For this reason, we cannot learn in peace times the psychology of war.

184
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Again, I will tell you that the training that we put together when it was intense enough, we would get to see in a micro way.

185
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
We get to see the beginning of those reactions that that guy's would deliver in war.

186
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
It's my belief that no one can give a prescription for a correct application of the principle of psychology in war.

187
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
The only thing of which we are certain is this, the psychology of the soldier is always important.

188
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:36.000
No commander lacking in this inner knowledge of his men can accomplish great things that I would agree with.

189
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:46.000
You have to understand your people and I would go one step further and say you not have to not just understand your people that work for you.

190
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You need to understand the psychology of the people that are above you in the chain of command.

191
00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Understand what's driving them, understand what kind of decisions they're making and why they're making those decisions.

192
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:10.000
As long as armies were small and the battlefield narrow, a leader could exert psychological influence on his army by personal example.

193
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:19.000
In modern wars, however, the high commanders are necessarily far in the rear and the majority of soldiers never even see them.

194
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Consequently, the task of influencing and understanding the soldier psychologically has in large measure passed to subordinate commanders.

195
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
For this reason, we shall deal only with the psychology of individuals and small units.

196
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So this is something that has held true today. And that element, there's this element in the army, it's called a company commander, which is above a platoon.

197
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And this guy is in charge of a hundred, maybe 150 guys and that's sort of the level that I think this is addressing.

198
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And the reason is because above the company commander, now you've got a battalion commander and while he has some influence, you know, he's got 500 or 700 guys under him.

199
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
They don't interact with him, but that company commander, he interacts with them.

200
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And so that's why he's saying that it's, that's the focus here.

201
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000
So now, in peace, we should do everything possible to prepare the minds of soldiers for the strain of battle.

202
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
We must repeatedly warn them that war brings with it, surprise and tremendously deep impressions.

203
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
And he keeps using that word impressions.

204
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And when I looked it up, just to kind of clarify, you know, the closest thing that I think he's talking about is it gives you ideas, it gives you feelings, you know,

205
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:59.000
war gives you these deep feelings, and it's trying to prepare men psychologically for what they're going to face because it's going to be deep.

206
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
We must prepare them for the fact that each minute of battle brings with it a new assault on the nerves.

207
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.000
As soldiers of the future, we ourselves should strive to realize that we will be faced in war by many new and difficult impressions.

208
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Dangerous that are thus first seen are already half overcome.

209
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
So if something you know, you've already half overcome it because you know what you expect.

210
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:38.000
It's the thing that you don't know. It's a thing that you don't see that is going to really affect you in a negative way.

211
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I'm going back to the book. And again, this is this opening chapter to me is battlefield psychology just applies to so many different situations.

212
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You know, yes, it's about battle, but it's about life. It really is about life.

213
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And when you talk about preparing teams or preparing kids for things in the world that are going to hit them and how hard it's going to be.

214
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
You know, I talk about with you, I get asked a lot about self defense, you know, and someone will say, what should I do with my daughter? How can I get her to be able to defend herself?

215
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Now we say, you know, given the talk, but in terms of jujitsu, one of the things that it helps a girl with and a guy both is you get used to physical contact.

216
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And if you're not used to that physical contact, when it happens to you for the first time, that alone is enough to throw you off and make you nervous and make you scared to make you freak out and not be able to react properly.

217
00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:02.000
But when you do jujitsu, I mean, you got somebody grinding on you and smashing you and holding you down and I mean it just gets you used to that and it becomes that it's become second nature for for a jujitsu guy, oh, you're going to get a fight, it's like no big deal.

218
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Yeah.

219
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And same thing with boxing or kick boxing, someone squares off with you.

220
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
If you've never square it off with someone before, it's a freaking panic situation.

221
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Or if you get hit or if you get hit, it's a panic situation.

222
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:26.000
So these things are a way of, you know, introducing people to dangers that are thus for scene and already half overcome.

223
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
So by training with these things, they're already half overcome when you get in the situation.

224
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000
And that's one of the things that makes training martial arts prepare you for these self defense situations.

225
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Let us take going back to the book. Let us take several actual examples from war and see what we can learn from them.

226
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
And studying these examples, it should be born in mind that they do not constitute universal formula.

227
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
I love this guy. Like everything that I think he thinks.

228
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
You know, I always say like you can't just apply the same formula to everything you have to have an open mind. You got to free your mind.

229
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And that's what he's saying right there. Bear in mind they do not constitute a universal formula.

230
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
They deal only, and now he goes in specifics. They deal only with German soldiers.

231
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Moreover, they deal only with particular German soldiers in certain definite situations.

232
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Whether other soldiers of other races would react similarly in similar situations, I do not know.

233
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
But I believe not. For instance, the mentality of the American soldier differs from that of the German.

234
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And even in America, the northern soldier differs from the southern.

235
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
A soldier from the city of New York has an entirely different viewpoint than the soldiers lived as a farmer in the middle west.

236
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Now, I will say this. I served with everybody. Guys from the city.

237
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:05.000
And I think where this is a lot different nowadays. And I think in 1910, if you were a farmer from the middle west, you were a farmer from the middle west.

238
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And you hadn't traveled. You hadn't seen much of the rest of the world. If you were someone from New York City, you didn't travel. You didn't see anything.

239
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So I think this is probably less true now where you have people that even though they're a farmer from the middle west,

240
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:24.000
guess what? They've been all over the country. They've lived in cities. They moved to cities. They were a lot more mobile of people now.

241
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
It's a much more global. And on top of that, you have the internet. You have movies. You have all this media.

242
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:38.000
So I think this is probably the less true now that people are more well rounded than they used to be.

243
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Yeah, they're exposed to more. Exactly.

244
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
He will therefore react differently and will require a different method of handling.

245
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Now that is true. It does nothing to with their background. It has to do well. It has to do with their background.

246
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.000
But it doesn't have to do with where their front has to do with who they are as human beings.

247
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
During the Battle of Tannenberg, Hindenburg, Ludendorf, these are German staff officers.

248
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And their staff were standing on a hill and observing a portion of the battlefield. While so engaged, the well-known Colonel Hoffman,

249
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
who is at the time the G3, came up to a young captain of the General Staff and said to him in a quiet tone.

250
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:26.000
My friend, you seem to have nothing to do. Pay attention. In the village of X, there is a land-sturm battalion.

251
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Call up its commander and say to him, a Russian cavalry brigade has made a deep penetration in the direction of village X.

252
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
The land-sturm battalion is to counter attack and throw back the Russians.

253
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
On hearing this, the young General Staff officer became quite excited and said, oh Colonel,

254
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000
that land-sturm battalion consists only of old men over 45 years old. They cannot defeat a Russian cavalry brigade.

255
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
The Colonel answered, merely given that order quietly.

256
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And if the battalion commander refuses to obey, ask him for his name. You will see that he will do it instantly.

257
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000
The uncaptant gave the order over the telephone, and the battalion commander terribly excited, answered,

258
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
how can I attack a Russian cavalry brigade with my old men? That's impossible.

259
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Then the captain said, I have been directed, if such be the case, to merely ask you for your name.

260
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Oh, me? Came the quick reply. I did not mean it in that way. Certainly we will attack.

261
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I will have my unit forward at once, and in five minutes we will be on the march.

262
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Your orders will be executed immediately, and they were.

263
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
The fear of unpleasant consequences resulted in the disappearance of all the commander's fears.

264
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
With the order, with another battalion commander in different circumstances, the effect would probably have been entirely different.

265
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Colonel Hoffman had correctly estimated the probably reaction of this battalion commander.

266
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Now this is the same idea for this is very clear. A really classical example of this art of estimating a situation psychologically was shown in year 1970, at 1917, by a brigade commander.

267
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
The general said, each of our three regimental commanders must be handled differently.

268
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Colonel A does not want an order. And as you listen to this, think about the people you know that people that you work with, and these three people exist everywhere.

269
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Colonel A does not want an order. He wants to do everything himself, and he always does well. We all know that person.

270
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Colonel B executes every order, but has no initiative. We all know that person.

271
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Colonel C opposes everything he has told to do and wants to do the contrary. We all know that person.

272
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.000
A few days later, the troops confronted a well-intrenched enemy whose position would have to be attacked.

273
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
The general issued the following individual orders.

274
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Colonel A, the one that wants to do everything himself, my dear Colonel A, I think we will attack. Your regiment will have to carry the burden of the attack.

275
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I have, however, selected you for this reason. The boundaries of your regiment are so and so, attack at X-hour. I don't have to tell you anything more.

276
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:42.000
To Colonel C, who opposes everything, he said this, we have met a very strong enemy. I am afraid we will not be able to attack with the forces at our disposal.

277
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Oh, general, certainly we will attack. Just giving my regiment the time of the attack and you will see that we are successful, replied Colonel C.

278
00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Go then, we will try it, said the general, giving him the order for the attack, which he had prepared sometime previously.

279
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:15.000
To Colonel B, the one that always must have detailed orders and doesn't have initiative, the attack order was merely sent with additional details.

280
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
All three regiments, attacked splendidly.

281
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:35.000
This is something that when, what when a late-fineye are working with companies, we run into this all the time where you have to modulate and adjust your, your directives and your interactions.

282
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Now I'm not saying, and this is the, the dichotomy that makes a tricky.

283
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:57.000
You can't be a different person to different subordinates or senior leaders. If you can't be this different person, you have to modulate slightly to make these different impressions on people and give them a different read of you.

284
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:07.000
If they talk to each other, they, they would still know you're the same person and you're not being this too faced or too faced or too faced or too faced person. You gotta have the consistency.

285
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:22.000
But you do have to modulate your personality and use it in different ways and use your speech and your words carefully because they affect different people in different ways.

286
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And I've always had that. I mean, even between life and his sister, Paltoon Commander, who are my two bros, but you know, I had a little different relationship with both those guys.

287
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
And that's just the way it was.

288
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And it was both relationships were great and both those guys were incredibly successful and aggressive in accomplishing the mission.

289
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Even though I had a little bit different, a little bit different relationship and a little bit different way of dealing with each of them.

290
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000
And they both had their own way of dealing with me. So it was, it was an interesting dynamic of how well that worked.

291
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
The general going back to the book, the general knew his subordinates.

292
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.000
He knew that each one was different and had to be handled differently in order to achieve results. He had estimated the psychological situation correctly.

293
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.000
It is comparatively easy to make a correct estimate if one knows the man concerned, but even then it is often difficult.

294
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
This is getting, this is where it just gets crazy.

295
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Because the man doesn't always remain the same. He is no machine. He may react one way today, another way tomorrow. And this is going back to, I think, our first podcast, where I said that people are crazy.

296
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
People are crazy and they do crazy things.

297
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And that's why you've got to constantly have the open loop with people. You've got to give them something and you've got to get that feedback and read and react to what they're saying and how it's changing.

298
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Soldiers can be brave one day and afraid the next. Soldiers are not machines, but human beings who must be led in war.

299
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Each one of them reacts differently. Therefore, each must be handled differently.

300
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And I know that sounds crazy. And people always think that in the military, you just got all these troopers.

301
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.000
And they're just machines that go on, you know, life and I have been quoted saying this many times because people ask us and say, well,

302
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000
you were in charge of seals and those guys, you know, they do whatever you say. And it's just no, they won't machines. They're humans. They have their own free will.

303
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:41.000
They make their own decisions. They decide what their thoughts are going to be. I don't decide what their thoughts are going to be. You have to actually lead them.

304
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Yeah.

305
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Furthermore, each one reacts differently at different times.

306
00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And must be handled each time according to his particular reaction. So it's again, you've got to be open looped and reading and reacting to what people are, how people are acting.

307
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:10.000
To sense this and to arrive at a correct psychological solution is part of the art of leadership.

308
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Yes. I'll add a lot of, sometimes you'll find the situation where let's say a boss.

309
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:28.000
He'll be, he'll say, hey, you know, what's wrong with you? Your workout put isn't, you know, as as as much as this next guy, you know, this guy, what's wrong with you? This guy follows directions like everything I say.

310
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:39.000
He does it perfectly. What's wrong with you? Kind of thing. So that isn't that an example of how a failure in doing that, recognizing what this guy responds to versus what this other guy responds to.

311
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000
But depends because some people, if I say echo, this guy's doing better with you. Some people are super competitive.

312
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And then, okay, well, I'm going to do better than that person. I'm going to get, you know, and some people will take that with a negative tone and say, you know what, that guy doesn't even see what I do.

313
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I'm going to do even less. So it depends. It's always a read. It's always a psychological read on people that makes it challenging.

314
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Yeah, so if, if you were to think like how you were saying, if you were to think that there's just this one formula, so you're putting out this one formula as the boss, right?

315
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And you see two out of your team of five, I don't know, five guys. Two of these guys are responding great. They're perfect, you know, but these other three guys are kind of operating with varying levels of success.

316
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:33.000
It's an indicator that I, you have, you know, a dynamic group of people under you, so and they respond differently to different things. That's one of those perfect examples.

317
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
That's the perfect example. That is it.

318
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Okay, now with regard to other matters, still in the same chapter, battle psychology.

319
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I've been in war, know that the hardest thing we had to do was lie quietly under hostile fire and wait for an attack.

320
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Why? And this is something that I completely understand and relate to is this feeling. And this is something I think I talked about it on the Tim Ferriss show was when there's a movie called the Pacific.

321
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And the first episode, you're expecting this big giant, you know, war battles to be breaking up whole time and they draw you out for, I want to say 40 minutes of them to put trolling through the jungle.

322
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:52.000
And the whole time you're just waiting in waiting and it creates this tension. And when I watch that for the first time, I remembered that tension from Romadi where if a fire flight hadn't started yet and you're walking through the streets and you just feel this tension because you're waiting for those rounds to go off and explosion to happen.

323
00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And it's very unnerving. It's, it's, it's the worst time to, it's the worst feeling. And I remember actually my first deployment to Iraq.

324
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:16.000
We were helping out a, a far ob, which is a forward operating base who had been getting murdered. And so we said, a cool, we'll go out there and try and help them out.

325
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And so we went out and we set up sniper positions and we started getting more and unfortunately these positions we were in.

326
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.000
They didn't give us any line of sight to the people that were launching mortars of us, so they were just freely launching mortars at us.

327
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And they were so close. They were, you know, within probably 200 meters that we could see we could hear the launches of the mortars and we could see that the trail of the mortar going up is launched.

328
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And so we would hear the launch and you couldn't see the guys doing it because they were hidden behind buildings, but you'd see the mortar trail going up in the sky.

329
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000
And you'd hear the launch is cool, cool, cool. And then you'd just wait because it's coming.

330
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
And I remember I was on a rooftop with one of my seal buddies and he was the automatic weapons gunner. And these rooftops really weird.

331
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:32.000
And I had these basically concrete squares all over them that were three or four feet deep. They were probably five foot by five foot. This whole rooftop was five foot by five foot concrete squares.

332
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.000
And we had gone out on this rooftop and walked over to the far end and it took us a couple minutes and we got there and we were set up.

333
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:49.000
And there with them. And we hear that noise and we see the launch of these mortars.

334
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:57.000
And he looks at me and he goes, you think we can make it back inside. Meaning, you think if we got to put it right now, we ran all the way back across the rooftop, back down the stairs.

335
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
We could get inside the building where you're going to be safe.

336
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:13.000
And I said, no, we're not going to make it back. And he said, what are we going to do? And I said, we're going to sit here and get some.

337
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:28.000
And he said, do you think it'll kill us? And I said, no, as long as it doesn't land in our quadrant right here, meaning this little five by five,

338
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
which would have obviously killed us. But I remember, so we endured this night. I said, I used the word and do it. That's a strong word.

339
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
We went through this night. We got more to the bunch. And our member thinking the next day, we all got back.

340
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And it was early. This is early in my first diploma. And this is the first time any of us had been under fire or any of that.

341
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And we, everyone was a little jumpy.

342
00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:04.000
And I remember thinking that those guys in World War I that had dared months and months and months of indirect fire, like mortar fire.

343
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:16.000
And there's something that's, if you want to know what it does to people go on YouTube and Google or and and search for World War I shell shock.

344
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:29.000
And you see these soldiers that are so completely psychologically scarred from that.

345
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:43.000
And it's an it's an eye opener. And the other really horrible thing about this was in World War I, this whole notion of PTSD and psychological scarring,

346
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:51.000
that didn't exist. If you broke down mentally, there was only one word for you and it was coward.

347
00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:06.000
So they, these guys, I mean, it was just a nightmare. And again, that's why World War I is the, to me is the most, the most vicious and atrocious of of the wars.

348
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And so, who is that that was with you that one asking, you know, is it going to get us?

349
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
It was a guy named Sean and that's all say this is good buddy of mine.

350
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And yeah, we were just how to let that look in each other feeling stupid waiting to get blown up along to those take when you hear the stone those were probably a

351
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:42.000
minute of flight time. So you just we'd hear three, you know, two or three of them. And the other funny thing that night was one of my other super paranoid brothers,

352
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:54.000
who was always like thinking it was the last day. And that guy on one of those, you know, we hear the launches and he comes up in the radio.

353
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000
That's three boys, count them out. And you know, because we heard three launches and I were waiting for three explosions and you know, the known gets hit.

354
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:11.000
But, and you know, again, I'm sitting here talking to those one night for us and those guys that were there on that fob, they were there every night, they were there getting murdered every night.

355
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And it's just one of those, you know, thing on that first deployment, we traveled around a lot. So we'd go and be in some weird outpost somewhere, like going into Apocalypse now.

356
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:30.000
And then the next day you'd be at the the Starbucks on base and on one of the firm bases. So it was very, it was very strange for us.

357
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:43.000
But the war is very different for different people depending on where you are, what your job is. And that's why, you know, you always hear me give respect and props to all the soldiers, the marines that were out there in the field far.

358
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
And they didn't have any opportunity to come back and take a wrap off ever, they were just in it all the time.

359
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Seals, little, the most part we generally would have some kind of a situation where we could get back and take a wrap off, not always though.

360
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
I mean, take a wrap off, meaning just like like like rest.

361
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Yeah, rest from the game a little bit. But, you know, that being said, you know, in a,

362
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:16.000
you know, in a society it was a very constant pressure like that. And the guys that were out in the correct order, I mean, they're getting more gold and machine gunned every night, basically.

363
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:28.000
And it was, you know, same thing. So again, I, I never want to make anything that I've been through, or even that.

364
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:44.000
We've been through in the modern era, compared to, I don't want to put that on the pedestal or put it on a scale next to what the guys in other wars have been through because, you know, every war has its thing, whatever its thing was.

365
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Yeah. And, you know, I just, I just don't ever want to throw trying to compare that. I'm just telling my simple experiences and I'm saying that the guys in World War One and what they went through.

366
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:05.000
I can't even fathom what that was like, you know, knowing just what a little bit of it feels like a little tiny, tiny fraction of it.

367
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
No one what that feels like.

368
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Compared to what it must have felt like day after day after week after week after month after month.

369
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:26.000
And if you want to get some indication as to what that felt like, like I said, go and watch World War One shell shocked videos and how completely psychologically scarred these guys were.

370
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000
And it's awful, it's awful to see.

371
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Day.

372
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Going back to the book, and this is the same subject, and when a soldier lies under hostile fire and weights, he feels unable to protect himself.

373
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Yeah, he has time, he thinks he only waits for the shot that will hit him. He feels a certain inferiority to the enemy. He feels that he is alone and deserted.

374
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:07.000
That's what we're talking about here. Now, always I like to tie these examples from war back to life.

375
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
And I think that this theme is very accurate. I think people get into two modes in their life.

376
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Moes where they're being offensive and they're making things happen and modes where they're defensive.

377
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
And things are happening to them and they're having to react.

378
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And I think that those psychological things, if you think about anyone thinks about their life and when times were good, it's when they were on the offensive.

379
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
You think about financially when you're doing good, you got your pills paid off and everything's going well.

380
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
And how you just feel, you feel good about it. You feel financially secure and you feel like, oh, I can make things happen.

381
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And then you think about the times in your life. And I spent 20 years in the military. You're not highly paid in the military.

382
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
You think about times in your life where you didn't have a lot of money.

383
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And how that feels completely different all of a sudden when you're walking down the street and you see something all that guy, that guy doesn't even have a job or that guy's getting free money.

384
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:16.000
You start to get that that feeling. Whereas the times in your life where you saved up money and you're doing well, then you you feel a lot better to same thing physically.

385
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
You know, with the more you go on the offense with your health and with your diet, the better you feel.

386
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And when you get taken down by a sickness or an injury or laziness, you let one of those things take you down.

387
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.000
All of a sudden everything is negative. And that's, that's why I think this relates very well.

388
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Is that when you lay under hostile fire and wait, you feel unable to protect yourself.

389
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:51.000
So, he goes into a quick story here. I remember one day in 1916 in Russia.

390
00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:00.000
During the night, we had relieved the Austrians. On the following morning, the Russians began a heavy artillery preparation, meaning they started bombing the crap out of them.

391
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000
We were unfamiliar with the terrain. We had no idea what troops were on our right or left. We did not know what artillery we had.

392
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:18.000
I was alone with my company in the midst of an Austrian battalion. I didn't know my superiors. The Russians had been firing for two hours, but our artillery didn't reply.

393
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
I went constantly from dugout to dugout to see and speak to my men. They should at least see that they were not alone.

394
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Repeatedly they asked me, are we really entirely alone here? Haven't we any artillery? They continued this way for hours.

395
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Our telephone wires had been shot to pieces. Finally, a tremendous noise came from our rear. Our own artillery was firing.

396
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:53.000
At once, high spirits returned. These soldiers no longer felt deserted. Each could see in here that our side was doing something now.

397
00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Each saw that he was being supported and that everyone was ready to repulse the attack.

398
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:08.000
In great defensive battles, one will constantly hear the remark. When the enemy artillery is firing, where is our own artillery?

399
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Everybody experiences that kind of gets the same thing when you're in a part of a team or part of a company.

400
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Things are starting to go backwards. People immediately focus on the negative.

401
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Immediately focus on the negative when you're on the defensive and when you're being attacked, everyone starts turning on each other almost.

402
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Where's our artillery? That happens.

403
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And then, to reverse that trend, when something positive happens, all of a sudden people start feeling positive again.

404
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
So it's important to be aware of that and recognize that and look for those sides.

405
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:52.000
And it's also important not to just do it if you're part of a team, but to detach yourself from yourself and see when it's happening to you as an individual.

406
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
When things start to go negative, are you amplifying the negativity?

407
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Because that happens. We do that.

408
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Now he goes on to talk about it is different during the attack.

409
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Here, the soldier himself acts. He has to do something. He moves forward. He fires. He assaults and dictates the action of the enemy.

410
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
At the moment of the attack, he never asks where is our artillery.

411
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:30.000
From the beginning of the attack, he feels himself the victor. He storms forward. He believes he can do everything by himself.

412
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:37.000
He needs no support. As soon as the attack is slows down, the cry for artillery is heard again.

413
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:44.000
So this is a psychological thing when people are attacking, they feel better. They feel like they're going to win.

414
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:52.000
And that's why that mentality of attacking is so important. You hear this in UFC fights. You hear people say, be first.

415
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000
That's literally the coach you hear from every coach in MMA will say that.

416
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Be first. Be first. They're wanting their fighter to initiate the attack and not be on the offensive.

417
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Now you do get some fighters that are really good counterpunters and that's understandable. That's another thing.

418
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:17.000
But on majority, it's be first. Attack first. Get one of the offensive. And we're always trying to encourage people to do that.

419
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000
In due to his well-ho, if you stay ahead of the guy, you're at an advantage.

420
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Even if the guy is kind of better than you, if you just stay ahead of him and focus on that.

421
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Because it's like he has to make up ground then he can do his game and be better than you.

422
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Honestly, on defense, it's almost like you don't have time to be offensive and to win or to be in the black. You're always in the red.

423
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
You get to get out of the red first. If you can, like I said, stay ahead of the guy, keep yourself in the black.

424
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
So you have this advantage. Even if he's even a little better than you were bigger or whatever.

425
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Yeah, it's such a weird dynamic there wherever it gets in the way like that.

426
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000
It's not even a weird dynamic. It's just a reality.

427
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000
But here's the deal. If you are on the attack, you are doing better.

428
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000
If you are on the offense, you're psychologically winning. And that has a huge impact.

429
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000
And if you're on the defense, you're psychologically losing your mind.

430
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000
And so that's an important thing. So if you're training with someone and all of a sudden you're like,

431
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
you're getting negative and you're mind you're getting dominated. Just save yourself. Oh, you know what's happening right now?

432
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Okay. I'm just, I'm just caught in the negative here.

433
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
So let's not worry about that. Let's figure out how to get back on the offense.

434
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
But you can't double down on your negativity. You're already getting dominated position wise.

435
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Don't double down on your negativity. When somebody gets in positive position on me, a better position on me.

436
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
I don't even care. Like I'm just like, Oh, cool. You got mounted. You're cross side.

437
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Whatever good position you got cool. Stand by because I'm going to come back.

438
00:59:49.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I don't let it get to me psychologically. Yeah. I relax. Back to the book. This desired act is in my opinion the reason why soldiers go so willingly on patrol.

439
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I repeat that this is extremely difficult to lie in hostile firing weight because one feels exposed to blind chance.

440
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:23.000
On patrol is different. The soldier feels that his destiny rested in his own hands. He feels that he's not dependent on blind fate.

441
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000
That he's not forced to go this way or that, but can to but can himself decide what to do. He feels that he controls the situation.

442
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
For example, he may think that path over the hill seems dangerous to me. I don't know why, but I have that feeling most definitely.

443
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Therefore, I prefer to go through the valley. He has the feeling that his actions depends on his own will and in consequence he can act in accordance with that will.

444
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Same message.

445
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But from a leadership position, how do you give your people that ability to be on offense?

446
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And that's what you want to constantly look for. How can you get them on offense?

447
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Now, this is going back into a little bit of what we talked about on the last podcast.

448
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And that's mission type orders and in this one, Von Scho calls it mission tactics.

449
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.000
In the German army, we use what we term mission tactics orders are not written out in the minutest detail.

450
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
A mission is merely given the commander. How it shall be carried out is his problem.

451
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.000
This is done because the company commander on the ground is the only one who can correctly judge existing conditions and take proper action if a change occurs in situation.

452
01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:02.000
There is also a strong psychological reason for these mission tactics. The commander who can make his own decisions within the limits of his mission feels that he is responsible for what he does.

453
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Consequently, he will accomplish more because he will act in accordance with his own psychological individuality.

454
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Give this same independence to your platoon and squad leaders. It is certainly evident from training and peace that there is that the more freedom allowed a subordinate leader in his training, the better result will be.

455
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Why? Because he is made responsible for results and allowed to achieve them in his own way.

456
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Boom. There it is again. And in life, what does that mean? It means take a personal initiative in your life.

457
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Being controlled, be first. Lead your life. Lead your life. People use that, you know, say, oh, you got to lead your own life.

458
01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And I'm, I'm, I'm going to put the emphasis on lead your leader of your life. You need to lead your life. Don't be reactive. Be aggressive.

459
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And go back to the psychology piece and back to the book again from Vaanshel. We know that psychology is tremendously important in war.

460
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It is a field unlimited in extent to which every conscientious soldier should give much time and study.

461
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And that's, you know, that's one of the things that I find about jujitsu is that it is also unlimited in extent. It doesn't stop. You don't, you don't ever get to the end of that learning process.

462
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And that's why we're always trying to be better. And that's why we still make mistakes.

463
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000
That's why you still make mistakes in leadership position. That's why I who sit around and teach about leadership and tell people how to lead.

464
01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I make mistakes and do things wrong and treat somebody the wrong way and make a mad and I got to go back and unwind that. That's what happens.

465
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:10.000
So we got to do as much as we can to learn as much as we can. Yet it cannot go back to the book yet it cannot be learned as one learns mathematics.

466
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It must be sensed.

467
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Unfortunately, we cannot formulate a set of psychological rules. Human reactions can never be reduced to an exact science.

468
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:31.000
War is governed by the uncertain and unknown. And the least known factor of all is the human element.

469
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And I think that's, that's what I like about this. The fact that war is governed by the uncertain and the unknown and the least known of all factor is the human element.

470
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And war again war is like life.

471
01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And that's why I think when you hear these stories in these philosophies about the psychology of war, you apply them to yourself and you lead your own war.

472
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:18.000
You detach yourself psychologically, you detach yourself and you observe and you see how these psychological elements are affecting you.

473
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And what you can do to straighten them out, constantly be asking yourself, am I on the offense or the defense? That's a huge question. We should check with ourselves every day.

474
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
And what if you're on the defense, what's putting you on the defense and how do you go back on the offense?

475
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You know, I think a lot of people with, we get asked a lot about doing tasks and how do you get stuff done every day.

476
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I think there's some people that their task list, their list of things to do makes them defensive.

477
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
They go, oh, I've got so much to do and I'm at the whim of this list.

478
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Where if you wake up and you say, no, no, I'm not going to be defensive about that list.

479
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I've got clear targets. This is a target list.

480
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And I know exactly what I have to do to knock them out and that is what I am going to go do.

481
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And that simple change and attitude, that self leadership is critically important.

482
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Now you're not going to see that, that you're in that situation, unless you detach and to the same thing with your team.

483
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It's the same thing with your company and the same thing with you personally.

484
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:33.000
You cannot be so engrossed in the problem that you don't see what's happening to yourself.

485
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So that's a little bit from battle leadership, Captain Aetoff Vaughn Shell, a smart and observant person that taught me a lot.

486
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And I much appreciate his thoughts.

487
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So that's a wrap for that book. And now it's time for some questions that we've got from the internet from Twitter, from Facebook.

488
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And appreciate everyone sending those questions. It's good some great questions.

489
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So question number one.

490
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Question number one.

491
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Okay, how important is mentoring in your experience, in your opinion.

492
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And if it's cool or whatever, what are some key points?

493
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Well, in doing it.

494
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Mentoring and this is, this is, asked in two ways, right?

495
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Because how important is mentoring to be mentored is very important.

496
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You need to suck knowledge out of people as much as you can and learn as much you can from people and find good mentors that are gracious with their knowledge.

497
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
That's very important and you should always be looking for good mentors to help teach you.

498
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And then as far as mentoring other people, that is also a key.

499
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:05.000
And one of the things I find about mentoring other people is that that is your legacy.

500
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That is what you leave behind.

501
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
For instance, I was in the SEAL teams for 20 years, which sounds like a long time.

502
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But the SEAL teams has been around for over 60 years.

503
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And their, the SEAL teams is not me at all.

504
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I'm a tiny, minuscule fraction piece of the SEAL teams.

505
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And, but what was when you leave the SEAL teams, you don't leave anything.

506
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
The only thing that you do, you don't leave anything of yourself.

507
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
The only thing close that you do leave is the people that you mentored, the people that you raised.

508
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And that's why you need to take great care when you mentor people to make sure that you're doing good job and raising people right.

509
01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And one of the interesting things about mentorship is that you have to let go of your ego.

510
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Because what you should want as a mentor, what you should desire as a mentor is that you're, the people that you're mentoring become better than you.

511
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
That's your hope is that they do better than you.

512
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
They perform better than you.

513
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
They become better than you.

514
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And you've got to be proud when that happens.

515
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
You know, I, I, in GJDs who, when I'm teaching people in GJDs who,

516
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and you know, you get some, somebody will say, oh, I'm going to tap you out one day. And I always say, good.

517
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I hope you do. Good. I hope you do tap me out because first of all, I'm teaching you GJDs who and GJDs who works.

518
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And so if you catch me in a GJDs who position in a submission hold,

519
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:56.000
it just works and I will be submitted. So good. If you're here and you're learning from me and you never get any better, then there's nothing wrong with the way I'm teaching you.

520
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So it should be the same thing in business. It should be the same thing in life.

521
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And the, the weird thing too is, is that it's hard to find people that want to be mentored in life.

522
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:17.000
It's hard. It's hard. A lot of young, you know, young, younger people. And I mean, I'm only 44.

523
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
But I've said this before. You know, when you're 40, when you're 23, you think you know everything.

524
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
You really do. And then when you're 27, you look back and you go, man, I didn't know anything then.

525
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
But I know everything now. And then when you're 33, you think, oh, when I was 27, I didn't know anything.

526
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000
But I know everything now. And eventually you reach a point, you know, when you're 40. And you say, well, when I was 35, I didn't know anything.

527
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
And I still don't know anything. And that's sort of when you reach a good point in your life where your mind becomes open.

528
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Well, it takes several years. And many years for that to happen. So if you can find someone that has really has an open mind and really wants to be mentored to young age, it's awesome.

529
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And you can really affect people in a positive way. And, you know, I had some great, I had some great mentors.

530
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Some of those older seals that I looked up to and said, wow, this person really has done an awesome job.

531
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Those people helped me out a lot. And sometimes it wasn't a active mentoring. It was more of an imitation.

532
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:25.000
You know, I was just imitating what they did and trying to, I didn't, you know, I can't remember that many times where someone sat me down and said, all right, so here's what you need to do to win.

533
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I didn't happen a lot. But a lot of times they'd be saying, hey, group of people, here's what you need to do to win. And I was taking notes and making sure that I remembered what they were saying.

534
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So yeah, mentoring is absolutely important. And it's also a very positive thing because you're having a positive impact on somebody's life.

535
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And that always feels good to watch them do well. Unless you have a big ego and an idiot. And in which case you, you'll be miserable.

536
01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Do you think that's kind of natural though to say from an instructor's point of view or or whatever, when you mentor somewhere in a mentoring situation.

537
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And that person does start to kind of catch up with you and beat you. Do you think that that's pretty, that's pretty common though, right, to have some resistance in your mind again.

538
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Well, yeah, I mean, everyone has an ego. You don't want to get tapped out by your students, but if you let that drive you, then you're not, then you're holding back information from them, then you're not pushing them to do better. So it might be a reality, but it's a reality that you have to deal with and you have to get rid of.

539
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's kind of like the growing pains of the group, right, the unit. So like if you have, you know, three students and or you have an academy of school.

540
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And now they get better than you, your school, which is kind of your whole goal and your whole motivation, your school is strong.

541
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000
But if you're still the bowl of the alpha beating everyone over and over, sure, you're individually strong and you go strong, but your school is weak. You know, so those growing pains kind of part of it.

542
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I tell my guys all the time at the gym, you know, the better you are the better I am.

543
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Yeah, I have this awesome move that's working well. Let me show you the counter so that I can learn to overcome the counter to the move and that's how we all get better.

544
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Next question, you say you keep your expectations of people kind of low.

545
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
How you're saying last time.

546
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000
But do you ever call people out for being disrespectful or, you know, something like that?

547
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:34.000
This is an interesting question and I was thinking about this question and there's one thing about it that is, and I don't know if this is just me.

548
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I don't know if I have a positive attitude. I don't know, but I don't, I don't see a bunch of disrespect.

549
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:54.000
People aren't disrespecting me. People aren't, you know, saying things to me that I find disrespectful. It just doesn't really happen that much to you to me.

550
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And I know I look like a serial killer and all that and that's fine. And so this is why it makes it a little bit of a tough question to answer because I'll tell you that.

551
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I believe that if you carry yourself a certain way, if you carry yourself respectfully and you respect other people, not only will people not disrespect to you, but they won't act disrespectful in your presence.

552
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And of course, what am I telling people all the time? I'm telling people to, you know, get up early. I'm telling people to work out and tell people to change your jitzu.

553
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I'm telling people to train boxing, investing in mojitai because all those things help your confidence. And when you're confident and people look at you and go, ah, that guy looks like he can handle himself.

554
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I think I'm going to show some respect in his vicinity. So I think it's, I think it's kind of a carry over of your presence and how you carry yourself.

555
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And the main point of that is if you are respectful to other people and you treat other people respectfully, unless you have someone that's just a complete jerk, they're not going to just come up and start being disrespectful to you.

556
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Now, on the interwebs and this is where I got this question from, he's kind of come back and I have to read through the questions again, but you know, he basically gotten to some kind of an incident when he's sticking up for someone.

557
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And that's different, you know, now if someone sees, if I see someone's getting bullied, you know, yeah, I might stick up, I might stick up for them.

558
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Sometimes I think to myself, why isn't that person sticking up for themselves, you know, that person has to stand up for themselves.

559
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:47.000
So there's kind of an interesting dynamic, but again, I think when, when you carry yourself with respect and confidence, not cockiness, but just with respect and confidence and who you are and what you do,

560
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I think that most people are going to be respectful when they're in your presence.

561
01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And I usually, I mean, I give respect to people and I usually get respect and I see people acting respectfully when I'm around.

562
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So I apologize if that doesn't solve the problem for someone that is, you know, being seen disrespect all the time.

563
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And I think the way that you carry yourself, you give an impression that you're not going to put up with this respect as well.

564
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So I think it's about presence, I think it's about giving respect and I think it's about having confidence.

565
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And I think that eliminates a lot of that need to call people out for being disrespectful.

566
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Next question.

567
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:49.000
So you do a lot of strength work as far as your workouts go, a lot of strength work, do you do any stretching or mobility stuff?

568
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
You know, isn't it important, especially, you know, for being a jujitsu guy, you know.

569
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Well, the actual question says, especially for an aging jujitsu player.

570
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
So, but that applies to kind of everybody though, right?

571
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Yeah, I think it's about all aging. But I kind of feel like this was directed at me as an old man at the age of 44.

572
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I'm an aging jujitsu player. Now, of course, that our gym, we have guys that are 50 and 60 years old that I roll with.

573
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:27.000
And they roll with the young studs and everything else. So I think aging is a relative term we're all aging.

574
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:35.000
The bottom line here is, yeah, absolutely. Stretching the mobility are important. I, I should do more.

575
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I don't do enough. That being said, I will say that a lot of the movements that I do involve mobility in their own right.

576
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
For instance, when I do squats, I squat all the way to the bottom.

577
01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So people are surprised at my hip mobility because I squat with heavy weights on my back and I go all the way down into the full squat position.

578
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So I'm relatively flexible in the hips.

579
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You know, if you do muscle ups and you're getting really good mobility work in your shoulders and same thing with ring dips.

580
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I mean, any of that, any of the ring, I'm on rings all the time.

581
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I have a lot of mobility and strengthening of those little muscles and keeping them healthy. So I do some pretty good there.

582
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.000
That being said, you know, I know I should do more. And whenever I get some kind of an injury, this is a bad policy.

583
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You know, I get injured and then I do mobility work.

584
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You know, I should do the other way around.

585
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I should do some of those things that I need to increase my discipline on. So I need to improve the amount of mobility work that I do.

586
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's one of those things that I don't find that enjoyable.

587
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And I don't find it that satisfying. Even though it does feel good.

588
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I mean, I enjoy the pain of it, but I don't.

589
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I don't feel those results like I want to.

590
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And so that's probably one of the reasons why I don't do enough of it.

591
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:17.000
But you know, you can see sometimes, you know, I'll, I'll sometimes I have to take a day where I just do nothing but mobility and I do nothing but grind out sore muscles because I'm so sore after nine days straight.

592
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm like, okay, I can't take this anymore. And my body will start to tell me, dude, you need to stretch out and take a day off.

593
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So I do that, you know, mobility, mobility, what with Kelly Starat and his book, the supple leopard and you know, I have that and when I have something going on, I'll dig into that book or dig into those videos and find out what I need to do to grind that problem out.

594
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And, and I love doing that. I love getting on that when when I need to, but I need to do it more.

595
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah, interesting. You kind of hear that question a lot. Like, since you do, you get to do you do mobility training, but you get to his mobility training.

596
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You do, so if you try to, there's something guys they don't do anything, so you get to and Dean sometimes will say this where he'll be like, okay, if you're going to, if you're a runner, what's the best way to train is to run.

597
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So if you're a jujitsu guy, the best way to train is jujitsu and that goes for conditioning and stuff is jujitsu based conditioning, but so like if you're like, if you're in the guard, the close guard and you're trying to hold a close guard and you're training five, even five days a week, you're energized, you're at, you know, abductors, abductors,

598
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:47.000
are going to get a lot of training. Yeah. Now, I will say this, you know, you look at like the 10th planet system and Eddie Bravo, and I mean, they really focus on flexibility becomes a great aspect of their game and I definitely respect that.

599
01:20:47.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I also do think that some people that go psycho with yoga and stretching can actually do more damage than good, you know, I've known, I knew some guys along the way that got really into yoga and as a years went on, I think it was debilitating for them, you know, you're, you're spine and your muscles are supposed to stretch to a certain point and when you start stretching them beyond that,

600
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:32.000
you used to, in my opinion, you start doing more on the good. Now, I'm not even close to that. This is no excuse. This is no, you say, hey, you're in danger. I'm no danger of stretching too much. So, but I just didn't want to throw that out there that some, I think you can, I think you can overdo it and you can go into these extreme positions that are not good for you anymore.

601
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And I've actually one of my, one of my seal buddies who was very into yoga for 15 years and he is messed up now and he says, yeah, you know, I think the main reason is because I went too far with yoga. So,

602
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, with everything right, you go too far in terms of your posture. I think that, especially if you're doing it in reference to your jujitsu, it's good, it's going to depend on your game. Like you mentioned the 10th planet system.

603
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
If you're in, if you like the 10th planet system, that's your, your thing.

604
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.000
To improve your flexibility, that's going to be a big asset compared to your deadlift.

605
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.000
But if you have a different type of system, or maybe you took jujitsu from a smash type guy, a bigger guy or something in his school is like, yeah, smash the guy, smash get on top.

606
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It's that much better just smash on top.

607
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Your assets are going to lie more in maybe some strength, maybe some balanced stuff.

608
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
For more self-insubmission, so it just depends on what game you want. Really.

609
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.000
But either way, when you do jujitsu in any capacity, you're doing mobility stuff.

610
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah. True.

611
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And at the same time, mobility training, otherwise does help your jujitsu, so it's kind of like a 2A string.

612
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Affirmative.

613
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Do you think you can have too much on your plate and how do you handle multiple tasks?

614
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Well, this is a questionnaire, if we actually answered this almost the exact same question.

615
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And do you, can you end up with too much stuff on your plate? Yes, you absolutely can.

616
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
That being said, before I go down the road, I've got too much of my plate.

617
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It is, you probably not doing good time management. You know, you're probably sleeping late.

618
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
You're probably not focused. You're probably all the interwebs when you should be getting work done.

619
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
You're probably listening to, you know, a music while you're trying to work and getting distracted.

620
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So there's all these things that we go, I got so much on my plate.

621
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
No, you don't. You have too much on your plate. You're just not focused when you need to be.

622
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You're just not getting, you're just not attacking the problems.

623
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And so what's the easiest thing to say is, oh, I think you got too much on my plate and you need to get rid of some stuff.

624
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
You know, so.

625
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
There's something that, this is an example.

626
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
If you've ever had something where it's something that's going to take you like 20 minutes.

627
01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:04.000
But it hangs over your head for a month and it becomes this soccer of mental, mental power.

628
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
How many of those things do you have? How many can you actually deal with before it starts ruining and losing your focus because you're not doing so.

629
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.000
These little 20 minute tasks are half an hour tasks that you don't do because you put them off and procrastinate.

630
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Those are the ones to get those things out of the way. Okay, you got too much stuff on your plate.

631
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Go get some of those things off your plate. They take a half an hour. There's so many things that you can get done in a half an hour.

632
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
If you just get on them that that's how that's one way to clear your plate.

633
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
So that's my first piece of answering this is is likely it's not that you have too much in your plate.

634
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
It's just that you need to focus.

635
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You need to get stuff done. You need to quit wasting time.

636
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Now that being said, if you are truly taxed, which it definitely happens.

637
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
If you are truly taxed, what do you do? Well, number one prioritize next to you.

638
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Right. This is back to the book, extreme ownership.

639
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
One of the chapters. One of the laws of combat is is prioritize next to you.

640
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So you got to take whatever all these things that you have to get done and put them in priority order and start to take care of the high-end.

641
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And go. And that's what you need to do.

642
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Another thing you can do is you can delegate.

643
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
If you got a team or if you got someone you can hire or you got someone that can help you out, you delegate and say,

644
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You know what? I hear I can't out of time to do this. Do this. I'll give you 50 bucks. I'll give you 10 bucks.

645
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
I'll do something that's easy for me to do.

646
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Like, you know, some tasks that I'm good at. I'll do for you. You do this for me.

647
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So delegate or hire somebody to help you or the last thing is you can say no.

648
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
You know, people want you to do more stuff. Say no to them. Listen, I can't do that enough of the capacity right now.

649
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So that's my cut on can you have too much stuff on your plate and how do you handle multiple tasks?

650
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Long board or short board.

651
01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:03.000
A surfing question. So I definitely like to surf. I surf as often as the waves are good.

652
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And as far as long board or short board, I surf both long board and short board.

653
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And, you know, from me, it's like ghee or no ghee. I mean, what's what, what are people on the mat have on?

654
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That's what I'm going to put on and that's what I'm going to get on.

655
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And with the waves, if the waves are good for short for short board, I'm going to grab my short board and go out.

656
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And if the waves are good for long board, I'm going to grab my long board and go up.

657
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And it's the same thing.

658
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I like to vary my training.

659
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I mean, so that I'm more well rounded across the board and I can handle more different situations.

660
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
So, and I enjoy both of them a lot.

661
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
See how surfing questions are like pretty linear.

662
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I mean, most sports questions are pretty linear compared to GJitsu.

663
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
GJitsu is freaking mayhem. It really is the complexity of it.

664
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And the directions that it can go are so crazy.

665
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Yeah. And I guess it could be argued that surfing could have that, but it's not as obvious.

666
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
It may even go into like a philosophical thing.

667
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yeah, or okay. But, but you could go down the philosophical path of GJitsu and you're going to go still.

668
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yeah, you're in the infinite middle way.

669
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So, there's something crazy about GJitsu and it is.

670
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I'm very, it's like what I forget what that quote was tonight from Vaughn Shell.

671
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000
But just how it's just the psychology of people is infinite.

672
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It's always changing and always different.

673
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And that's very similar to GJitsu.

674
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Yeah.

675
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Infinite always changing, different with every person you roll with.

676
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Right.

677
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Every person you deal with psychologically that different.

678
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Every person you roll with has a different little thing in their game.

679
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And you never know how they're going to react to your movement.

680
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
So, that's why psychologically it's such a good training methodology.

681
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Mm-hmm.

682
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
How has your military training affected your training slash coaching of GJitsu?

683
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
IE, more structure, et cetera.

684
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Well, interestingly, I would say that my military training has made me want to be less structured in GJitsu.

685
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It may be want to be less structured in military.

686
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:27.000
The military, the experiences of combat made me want to make training less structured because, again,

687
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:35.000
it goes back to what we talked about last week, I want to train people's minds to be ready for situations that they don't expect.

688
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Training the mind is more important than training the body.

689
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Now, that being said, of course, you have to have, you have to have a certain level of standard operating procedures.

690
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You have to have a certain level of knowledge.

691
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:58.000
So, in GJitsu, you've got to make sure that people have those basic knowledge, the basic, I shouldn't say basic, the fundamental knowledge.

692
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
You know, people used to say that when the seal teams and we would teach different tactics.

693
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.000
And for a while, we were saying basic tactics, like hey, you need to stick with the basic tactics.

694
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
And I said, look, these aren't basic tactics.

695
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
These are fundamental tactics.

696
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And that's the same thing with GJitsu. Basic tactics are, they're not basic. They're fundamental to the game.

697
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And then everything else is built upon those.

698
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.000
So, I would say that my thoughts around GJitsu training are not more structured than less structured.

699
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:40.000
And also, in terms of the style of environment, I like to be in, I like it.

700
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Probably is on structure just about us.

701
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
I mean, there's definitely some structure, but I don't like it to be overly structured.

702
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I would rather have people with the mindset of self-discipline rather than imposed discipline.

703
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So, in other words, you, my students must do as I command and otherwise you will be punished.

704
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
That's imposed discipline. And that's not what I'm looking for.

705
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
That doesn't expand people's brains.

706
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
It doesn't make people smarter or able to think differently about situations.

707
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Instead, it entraps their brain.

708
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
So, I want people to have an open mind when they're training GJitsu.

709
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
I want them to have their own ideas.

710
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I don't want them to fall in ideas.

711
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I want them to fall in love with them to springboard off of my ideas.

712
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
And then I want them to give them their ideas back to me.

713
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So, I can springboard off their ideas.

714
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
That's how you expand your game and get better.

715
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
And, you know, that means chaos and training.

716
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
That means starting in different positions.

717
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
That means using different pacing.

718
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You know, let's do three minute rounds.

719
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Let's do one minute rounds.

720
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Let's do 20 minute rounds.

721
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Let's do all these different scenarios that get you ready for different situations.

722
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Let's use G, let's use no G, let's do put MMA gloves on.

723
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Let's hit each other.

724
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Let's hit each other during take-downs.

725
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Let's mix it up.

726
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.000
So our brain is constantly trying to, or constantly adapting to situations that it didn't expect.

727
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.000
That's my BJJ training philosophy.

728
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Yeah, you'd think obviously you're, you know, just military that obviously you take your class and you're going to be saying yes sir, no sir.

729
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
But yeah, it's kind of the opposite.

730
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
It might experience.

731
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yeah.

732
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I'm there to teach not to impose.

733
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
What if someone comes in late?

734
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I feel about that.

735
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Come on on the mat.

736
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I'll show you what you missed.

737
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
You know?

738
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Better than not coming at all.

739
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I mean, yeah, definitely better not coming at all.

740
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But I mean, you think that these guys that have jobs, they are working, they got wives and kids and car accidents and guy shows up late for class.

741
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Thanks for coming, man. I appreciate it. Get in here.

742
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Let's also show you what you missed and let's roll.

743
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah.

744
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:11.000
You know, I'm not thinking that the guy is in a military organization that is missing his movement to go on assault.

745
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
No, that's not happening.

746
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
The guy is a human.

747
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
That's got a life in GJJ, too.

748
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
He's there to train.

749
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So let's help him train.

750
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Hey.

751
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Yeah.

752
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
That's good.

753
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Do you ever fail to wake up early?

754
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Yeah.

755
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You know, you missed it.

756
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Of course.

757
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
So, and if you do what you do immediately,

758
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
right when you get up.

759
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Okay.

760
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
So first, do I refer to get up early?

761
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yes.

762
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
The answer is yes.

763
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
It does happen.

764
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
And as soon as, you know,

765
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000
if I wake up,

766
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
now,

767
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
if I wake up and I go,

768
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
you know, I slept late.

769
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.000
You know, I have multiple alarm clocks.

770
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Now, so if it's a critical situation,

771
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
you're going to vibe a flight to catch.

772
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I got those alarm clocks are all charged and ready to fire.

773
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So therefore, there's no sleeping through

774
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
a situation like that.

775
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
It can not happen.

776
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It's never happened to me.

777
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
But if it's, hey, it's a day where I'm not doing anywhere.

778
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000
And it's a Sunday.

779
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And I sent my alarm clock for, for, for,

780
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
for 30.

781
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And I, you know,

782
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
in the, in the dreadjava nightmare,

783
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I wake up and I turn off and then I decide,

784
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
oh, I'm going to be weak and lay my head back down.

785
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And I'll also wake up and it's five or six,

786
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000
thirty or whatever.

787
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
And I slept in.

788
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
So immediately, I feel, I feel guilty, you know,

789
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
because I, the guilt is because I know I missed a great part of my day.

790
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.000
You know,

791
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I know that I missed the morning.

792
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I know I missed the sunrise.

793
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And, and I'm addicted to that feeling of seeing that.

794
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And so to miss it, it feels really bad.

795
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And once you get in that train of where you get used to that,

796
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it becomes addictive.

797
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
You love to be up when it's dark.

798
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000
You love to see the sunrise come up.

799
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
You love to have your day started.

800
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
It's a very, very positive feeling.

801
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
It feels really good to do that.

802
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And so when you miss it,

803
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
it's like you, you, you,

804
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
you went backwards.

805
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
And it, it definitely makes you feel bad.

806
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And for me personally, you know,

807
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I mean, and, and, you know,

808
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000
there's a lot of guys that didn't come back that didn't,

809
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
don't have the opportunity to get up early.

810
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
That don't have the opportunity to seize every day and make something good happen.

811
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And so I feel guilty that I'm letting those guys down too.

812
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And, you know,

813
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
you just want to, you want to live a positive life that's worthy of their sacrifice.

814
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
And, and when you don't, you feel guilty about it.

815
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And, and, and, and of course,

816
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
there's sometimes, and I should do this more often when,

817
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
you know, my body does need more sleep.

818
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
And usually I try to make that mean that I go to bed earlier,

819
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
rather than rather than waking up later,

820
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
to that way you keep your sleep patterns organized.

821
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But, you know, sometimes it's hard.

822
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Life gets in the way and you stay up late.

823
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And, I know there's a lot of folks and there's a lot of medical proof that says that I should sleep more.

824
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
And we also sleep more.

825
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And that's something I'd like to try out.

826
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So at some point, my life just now.

827
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
No, no, no.

828
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Just not now.

829
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Okay, so, uh, final question.

830
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000
How do you take leadership over yourself?

831
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You know, do the same principles apply and, you know, how's it different?

832
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Well, first of all, let me say that this question came from a guy on the interwebs named Amos Craig.

833
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And I don't, I don't even know if that's a real name or maybe his name is Craig Amos.

834
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I don't know.

835
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
He's got a, uh, on Twitter.

836
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
He's at D-A-M-O-Z-E-R.

837
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And what was funny in what made this question stand out was he made a YouTube video.

838
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Uh, video of him playing acoustic guitar and singing a song.

839
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So if you look up on YouTube Amos Craig Amos Craig and he's got this song.

840
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
It's like a song about Jockel Will.

841
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Like it.

842
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It's actually pretty funny.

843
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
He gets a lot of, uh, you got a lot of laughs out of me and some of the folks that watched it.

844
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000
So it's actually a catchy song.

845
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It's like, if you play it, like if you were just playing it, you didn't know Jockel,

846
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:42.000
you know, you'd be like, oh, this kind of a cool little, you know, um, like a kind of folksy kind of catchy.

847
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Yeah.

848
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Yeah.

849
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
So he made that song.

850
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
And it's like I said, it's funny.

851
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Check it out.

852
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
It's kind of weird too because, you know,

853
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
no one's ever done some weird stuff like make a song about me.

854
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So yeah, that was kind of weird too.

855
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I had to get over the weirdness part.

856
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
At first I was like, oh, I liked it.

857
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
This is bizarre, but uh, but then he seems like it's totally good dude.

858
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And he was just having a fun time.

859
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
So good on him.

860
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
And he asked a question, how do you take your, how do you take leadership over yourself,

861
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
do the same principles apply?

862
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
How is it different?

863
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And we actually talked about this a lot today with Von Schill.

864
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
And the answer is clearly yes.

865
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
That is what we were talking about today.

866
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:31.000
And the, the thing about leading yourself as you have to be able to detach to lead yourself.

867
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And when you detach, if you can detach from inside your brain,

868
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
then you can become your own leader.

869
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And that is where you start to make progress.

870
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
And he team without a leader doesn't do well.

871
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
So if you're a human and you don't have leadership of yourself,

872
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
you're not going to do as well as you could if you are in a leadership position.

873
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000
But the principles are the same with leadership,

874
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
whether you're leading yourself or whether you're leading a team.

875
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Things like having simple clear goals.

876
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
And being disciplined in that discipline within the team or within yourself,

877
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
equaling more freedom.

878
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
We just talked about prioritizing execute.

879
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
That happens with a team.

880
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
It happens with an individual ownership.

881
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Taking extreme ownership.

882
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
If you're in a team and you take ownership of your problems.

883
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And everyone takes ownership of the problems within the team.

884
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Then they solve those problems.

885
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Well, guess what?

886
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
If you're a person and you're leading yourself and you take ownership of when

887
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
mistakes happen, then guess what?

888
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
You can solve those problems.

889
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
If all you do is say, oh, that's not my fault.

890
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
It's everyone else's fault.

891
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
No, you're never going to solve those problems.

892
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
But if you take ownership of when things go in bad,

893
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
then you can fix them.

894
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000
So the principles are the same.

895
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
You have to lead yourself.

896
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
You are your own leader.

897
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
And you know, we open today with a heavy, heavy poem and a conversation

898
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
about a guy, the poem was called a rendezvous with death.

899
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:07.000
And while that is heroic and it's noble and it's courageous,

900
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
and actually guess what?

901
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
We all have a rendezvous with death.

902
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
There's no escaping that.

903
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And this trip we're on.

904
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
It's a short one.

905
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.000
But instead of thinking about that rendezvous with death,

906
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000
let's instead focus on a rendezvous with destiny.

907
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And that's a phrase that you hear it and it sounds almost borderline corny.

908
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And I'll tell you why it doesn't to me because I worked with a group in Iraq called

909
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
the First of the 506, part of the 101st Airborne Division.

910
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:52.000
And it was one of their sayings that came all the way back from when the unit

911
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
was stood up for World War II.

912
01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:03.000
And the major general, a guy named William C. Lee, he said that while the 101st has no history,

913
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
it has a rendezvous with destiny.

914
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And they fulfilled that destiny.

915
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
The 101st Airborne Division fulfilled that destiny over and over again during

916
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
D-Day during the Battle of Bulge during the siege of Bastone.

917
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And you know what?

918
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
When I was in Ramadi, they fulfilled that destiny again the first of the 506,

919
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and the brothers.

920
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
So think about that rendezvous, not the rendezvous with death, but the rendezvous with destiny.

921
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
And make the most out of the opportunities that you have through discipline, through hard work,

922
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
through focus and drive.

923
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
And most importantly that you are responsible for the path you take.

924
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Don't waste time with things that don't matter.

925
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Get in the game, get in the gym, get to work, get to living.

926
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Because this is your life.

927
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Lead it. Lead your life.

928
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Lead it. How you want to lead it.

929
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Every second of every day.

930
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Take that leadership of your life.

931
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
And that's all I've got for tonight.

932
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
So, to everyone out there.

933
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Thanks for listening.

934
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Thank you very much for spreading the word and most of all.

935
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Thank you for getting after it.

936
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
This is Jocco.

937
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
And until next time.

938
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Out.
