That's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, you know, there's like, oh, you know the formula. It's essentially like, yeah, when you think you people who are like so confident, they're the ones that know less than the people who are like not confident at all because they know how much there is not to know. But so now you have, and when I say it's a social thing or it feels like a social thing, it's kind of like people are still stuck in that little zone that's like, it is beneficial to go to college. Yeah, yeah, sometimes you feel like they, or whatever they are, are doing it on purpose and sometimes you just feel like, I think this is just some curriculum that no one had the like gusts to do to just be like hey, we're doing it overhaul. It's like your whole brain and body, but brain, trying to, trying to like be lazy for lack of a better term, like I said before, trying to save energy, trying to save work, like when you do more work or less work. You should be able to look at echo and be like, you know what, I like that echo, he's pretty nice, but also he can get a little bit lazy sometimes, but overall, you know, we're good. Except when it came to those feet, man, those feet got it, you know, like, you got a like, how you guys say, you got the line on some stuff. And it's not the kind of like, like, I don't want to say useless because I don't want to like put, put that kind of stigma on other types of supplements. Like I wonder if that's like a laser, you know, by nature, like the human body and brain is kind of late for lack of better term in slaves. The reason that, so what he's saying is, you like a criminal that sort of makes it and like all of a sudden puts down his thieving tools and starts saying, you know, thieving it's bad and you're going to be right just wet. It's like it's easy to know everything when you think there's only like three or four things to know. You're going to be great in the military, in the in the in the in the rear of the military, because you're you don't like ambiguity, as soon as you're in combat, you don't know exactly know what's happening. Yeah, you know, when you kind of like go down the list, you kind of like, it's a whole system. Like this is how you can kind of tell that people are still in the zone of like college is a good thing. Next chapter 23, mothers of incompetence were going kind of heavy, not going to go to deep into this chapter because it's going a little bit into the psychology world, which again, I think this, some of the psychology is a little bit outdated. You start to hear people being like, hey, college, you know, you're going to be able to say that stuff. Because you got to be a little bit more conformist because you got to get the teet-you know you got to be on board, but it attracts people that are too much. Yeah, you got to kind of, I don't know, back in the day, it seems like everyone was way more just in the middle. Do you think, and I don't know the answer to this, but I just, I do kind of consider the other side of this, you know, how you, how you, how you just said, um, the school kind of is structured to provide or to develop good workers. People that were square away, people that were highly disciplined, people that were loved for things to be in order and when things weren't going right or things were getting wild, they'd lose their minds. No, no, you want to know something what I think is messed up now is I think a lot of times the school right now is to develop people to go to college and feed the academic growth of colleges. You have to train in it just like Gigiitsu, just like playing guitar, just like shooting basketball. It kind of seems like that there's certain times and then the education is kind of like trying to facilitate those times. Like now there's like 40 things that don't know. Because I heard people say like, oh yeah, you drink this like tea. So, I think a lot of the educational system right now is a feeder program for the college system, which is gonna charge people money and this is sort of like the housing crash too. Like at a factory or at it, you know, one of the jobs that were freaking prevalent for those times as times change, you need a little bit more education now for these jobs. And even just valuing like the group and then on the other hand, valuing the individual, it's like you got to value both of those things. So it's kind of like, okay, it's like, I think I am committing this. So there's a thing that sounds like, oh, that's kind of like funny. So kind of like a weird, like I said, laziness, lack of better term mechanism.
