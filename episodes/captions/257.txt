[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 257 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] The president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver star to
[00:00:12] Sergeant First Class Ryan Michael Hendrixon, United States Army for exceptional gallantry in the face of
[00:00:18] the enemies of the United States of America with exceptional valerous conduct as the engineer sergeant
[00:00:26] of special operational detachment, Bravo, SF-ODB-7220 advanced operations based north
[00:00:35] special operations task force afghanistan on 23 February 2016 during operation freedoms
[00:00:43] Sentinel in support of resolute support mission 4. On 23 February 2016 members of the fifth
[00:00:52] eighth and tenth special operations conduct actively advised by SF-ODB-7220 conducted clearing
[00:01:07] operations in order to deny a known Taliban safe haven. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon
[00:01:15] led a team of national mine reduction group and MRG soldiers ahead of the main effort to clear
[00:01:23] routes of improvised explosive devices, IEDs clearing 15 IEDs in the process.
[00:01:32] While conducting movement to the first compound of interest,
[00:01:35] a member of this element struck a tripwire IED. The element immediately took cover.
[00:01:41] However, there was no detonation. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's team was then immediately ambushed
[00:01:47] by heavy enemy machine gun, small arms and RPG fire from approximately 15 meters away.
[00:01:57] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon immediately directed his NMRG team to place
[00:02:03] suppressive fires on the enemy while providing detailed terminal attack guidance,
[00:02:07] which enabled an F-16 closer support platform to conduct a strike on fortified enemy fighting
[00:02:15] positions danger close to his position. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon assessed that his
[00:02:21] element needed to maneuver away from the enemy's position to ensure the safety of his NMRG members.
[00:02:29] He quickly led the element to bound back to a friendly position by creating additional distance
[00:02:34] between his team and the enemy air assets were able to successfully neutralize the enemy
[00:02:40] during a second air strike. After the smoke cleared following air to ground engagements,
[00:02:47] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon immediately began clearing a path for friendly forces
[00:02:52] by leading his team to clear several complex IEDs designed to target friendly dismounted elements.
[00:02:59] During exfiltration, the element was re-engaged by heavy and effective enemy pkm rpg sniper
[00:03:09] and mortar fire, which resulted in multiple us and partner force casualties.
[00:03:16] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon directed afghan commandos who were pinned down and separated
[00:03:21] from the main element to maneuver to and gain cover behind his position.
[00:03:25] Under heavy enemy fire, Sergeant First Class Hendrixon directed friendly elements to a nearby
[00:03:33] compound where the casualty collection point CCP was established. After conducting headcount,
[00:03:41] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon realized that two partner force members were missing.
[00:03:48] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon organized a team to locate and recover the separated and potentially
[00:03:54] wounded friendly forces. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon had to be held back numerous times while
[00:03:59] air support conducted additional attacks on enemy positions. Once the air to ground engagements
[00:04:06] were complete, Sergeant First Class Hendrixon selflessly maneuvered the recovery team under
[00:04:12] enemy small arms fire to retrieve the missing friendlies. Upon reaching the two missing soldiers,
[00:04:20] they discovered that the soldiers had been mortally wounded. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon
[00:04:26] then utilized a ladder as a litter to help carry the wounded soldiers to the CCP while his
[00:04:32] element continued to engage enemy forces with suppressive fires.
[00:04:38] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's actions prevented the Taliban forces from recovering the bodies
[00:04:44] of friendly forces which ensured all partner force members were accounted for, leaving no one behind.
[00:04:55] Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military
[00:05:00] heroism and reflect distinct credit upon himself. The Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan,
[00:05:08] the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Special Operation Component Command,
[00:05:13] Afghanistan Special Operations Joint Task Force, Afghanistan, and the United States Army.
[00:05:26] So obviously that is a silver star citation from an incredibly hard mission
[00:05:34] and this particular individual, this Special Forces soldier Ryan Hendrixon, he had already been
[00:05:44] through hell just to get on that mission. Luckily for us, he has written a book about his experiences
[00:05:52] which is called Tip of the Spear and is an honor to have him with us here tonight to share
[00:05:59] his story. Ryan, that was a doozy of a mission. Thanks for coming on man. I really appreciate
[00:06:07] you guys having me on here. Yes, that was this awesome. Well it's good to meet you and I will
[00:06:14] dive into that some of the details around that, what you did there because really that's
[00:06:20] you know like I said you already been through a hell of a lot just to be on that mission in the
[00:06:24] first place you've been well we'll get there. But yeah let's start at the beginning and you know
[00:06:31] I read your book and it's called Tip of the Spear, the incredible story of an injured green
[00:06:37] berets returned to battle and I always like to start at the beginning so let's start at the beginning
[00:06:45] let's see what made Ryan Hendrixon. So you start off here in the book I grew up in the unincorporated
[00:06:52] California town of Fall River Mills, Nestle between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mount Ranges in
[00:06:59] Rugged Shastock County and then you and I always have to say this I have to jump around in the book
[00:07:06] I'm not going to read the whole book you have to buy the book if you want to get the whole story
[00:07:10] but I'll fast forward through a bunch of the highlights this is always a good way to start life
[00:07:16] pretty much sucked because my mother who delivered my sister and me into this world was
[00:07:22] hooked on drugs and alcohol. Dad's center packing my dad was a Vietnam vet who did two tours as
[00:07:29] an aviation crew chief before returning to the Pacific Northwest and eventually northern California
[00:07:35] following his honorable discharge from the US Army. During the Vietnam War my dad's primary
[00:07:40] aircraft was the DH3 otter with the 54th aviation out of Vung Tao but he constantly found himself
[00:07:48] flying into combat in a Huey military helicopter formerly known as the Bell UH1. It was in a Huey
[00:07:57] that my father experienced the true horror of war as an M60 door gunner using the deadly firepower
[00:08:04] at his fingertips to rain down death on NVA troops and Vietcom. So your dad was in NAMM. How many years
[00:08:14] did it? Do you like the two years like hey I was in Vietnam I did two years and got out and
[00:08:19] stay in longer what do you do? Well yeah he actually actually did two tours in Vietnam so total
[00:08:24] of four years in the Army but he did a two back to back to back to tours in Vietnam.
[00:08:29] As in two years straight dang. Yeah well there was a there was a break because he came back
[00:08:36] for our nr and then went back so you know kind of little break but yeah he did he did a
[00:08:42] two tours over there and what what do you know anything about his decision making process on that?
[00:08:49] His so what we have talked about his decision behind wanting to do multiple tours in Vietnam
[00:08:55] is never wanting to love the people and number two it's it's combat and combat that's a
[00:09:02] dicken extremely dick dangerously a dicken and that was kind of when he was over there he's like
[00:09:08] hey I can go back to whatever northern California or Oregon or I can sit here and just keep
[00:09:15] getting after it. Yep. And the choice was pretty obvious for how old was he? He left out a high
[00:09:21] school he volunteered for the Army at high school which what do you know what year it was?
[00:09:25] 1966. Oh dang. I think yeah around in there. But then he got out. So he did two tours two
[00:09:35] years straight with a little break do you know how you got out? I'm not extremely sure the decision
[00:09:42] making process behind him getting out as he told me you know back in those days being in the military
[00:09:48] wasn't like it is today. And so you know getting out and moving on with your life or whatnot like
[00:09:55] that that is just the military wasn't popular at the time. It wasn't a prestigious thing for
[00:10:01] you know like today us serving it's you know it means something and back then it's he's like
[00:10:09] yeah well if you went in in 66 so he did need the two tours in nom so he's the we're talking
[00:10:16] yeah this is 1968 1969. Yep. The wars freakin everyone's against it. You guys moved around a bunch
[00:10:25] um redding uh you say this about your dad before Wendy and that's your sister before Wendy and I
[00:10:32] came in the world though my dad was a guy who liked his beer. You get drunk and if you happen
[00:10:38] across pass with him in a wrong way you would most likely be at the losing end of a fist fight
[00:10:44] you worked hard logging putting in crazy 12 hour days but he partied even harder. When the
[00:10:49] logging industry was booming and money was good coming in he was blown a healthy portion of his
[00:10:53] del on booze and you go into some detail here he was just sort of blazing a pass of destruction
[00:11:03] one night he's like drunk and basically feels like his life is kind of going nowhere. Yep.
[00:11:13] And he's well I'll go to the book here. Well driving in his drunk and stoop where my father thought
[00:11:20] about what his life had become. His options had slowly dwindled down over the years with no hope
[00:11:26] and no future he believed he was facing his last choice to end it all. Dad pulled his truck in front
[00:11:31] of uncle Steve's house. Redd is he shifted into park a man appeared in front of the house and walked
[00:11:37] up to the driver's side window. Dad hadn't seen him leave the house so he didn't know how or why
[00:11:43] this man had approached his car. My uncle lived in the middle of nowhere. Larry Hendrickson the middle
[00:11:50] aged man dressed conservatively had a smile on his face. My father never seen this man in his life.
[00:11:55] How do you know my name he asked? The man ignored a question. Larry your out of chances aren't you he
[00:12:01] asked. This time my father was too stunned to answer. It doesn't have to be that way the man
[00:12:07] continued. Jesus has a better plan for you and your life. In front of my uncle's house that night my
[00:12:13] father found God. After that his hellian days slowed to a trickle that didn't mean he didn't get
[00:12:20] pissed off at the cards he was dealt in life especially after he had just polished off another six
[00:12:24] pack but my father like everyone else I've met including myself was on a journey.
[00:12:30] So that sounds like almost a mystical situation like where does dude come from?
[00:12:35] Yeah so talking out or talking it out with my dad and it's one of the most powerful stories
[00:12:40] but yeah he was so he threw the truck into park and he was going to bring my sister and I
[00:12:47] two my uncle's house tell my uncle to take care of us then he was going to go shoot himself in the
[00:12:53] head and that's I don't know I mean you know I am religious and I believe you know I believe that
[00:13:01] God has a plan for everybody and that was just the plan. Did this guy
[00:13:07] did we ever see this guy again? I don't think he had we ever did I I was young so but I don't think my
[00:13:14] dad ever did now crazy yeah so you guys move around for a while you say we lived out
[00:13:24] we lived out in the woods in a house that had no running water due to damage pipes and
[00:13:28] limited electricity so the place was cheap your dad got hurt and then he gets rehealed up
[00:13:36] and and you say it was clear that he couldn't even afford a home with running water or steady
[00:13:41] electricity his only option was to have us move in with his mother who lived in Colton or again
[00:13:47] won a 100 miles to the south Colton was even smaller than Birk and Field but my grandmother could
[00:13:53] help provide the necessities of life while my father got under his feet and attended a Bible
[00:13:57] college he wanted to become a preacher fast forward a little bit after my father got ordained as a
[00:14:03] preacher his first pastor it was at a small church in Lincoln City on the Central Oregon Coast.
[00:14:10] He seemed happy and we as a family were happy although we were still poor didn't
[00:14:15] matter much because life was good my dad didn't my dad being a preacher didn't lift us out of poverty
[00:14:20] actually just the opposite happened we had to live in a tent for several months while we waited to
[00:14:25] move into the upstairs of the parsnige tent living wasn't bad but it did get embarrassing when
[00:14:31] other kids saw our living conditions and teased me at school all right let's get down to brass
[00:14:37] tax how big of a tent was this tent um I would say a last intent afghan alaskan tent and now
[00:14:46] I kind of feel bad about writing that in there because I've definitely lived in a last
[00:14:51] intent with about 15 other dudes and so we actually had it pretty nice um yeah
[00:14:57] right on well that's a positive attitude bad I like it um you continue on here after the
[00:15:06] tiny church in Lincoln City couldn't afford to keep its doors open we were forced to pack up
[00:15:10] and move again this time we settled in the sleepy logging town of low ol Oregon 20 miles southeast
[00:15:17] of Eugene and populated with 1000 residents my dad did his best to keep us in one spot until I
[00:15:23] could finish high school and move on with my life I guess having four years and one place is why
[00:15:28] I say that low is my hometown I was always active as a kid preferring to wander around the foot hills
[00:15:35] of the cascade mountains or play sports rather than sitting on my butt watching movies or doing
[00:15:38] nothing I'm sure I was hell for my dad to raise but he instilled in me the idea that I should set
[00:15:44] the rules for my life not let life set rules for me at low ol high I gave everything I had to
[00:15:51] our football and wrestling programs I was never the most talented athlete but every coach said I was
[00:15:57] the toughest kid they'd ever trained that was when I first heard the saying that boys to stupid
[00:16:03] to quit a backhanded compliment for sure but I wore it like a badge of honor how good were you
[00:16:10] at wrestling um I was mediocre and so but did you start wrestling in high school or did you wrestle
[00:16:19] before that a third yeah so I was against kids that were wrestling since they were in whatever
[00:16:25] first grade kindergarten yeah I was never a rock star at it or anything like that but I picked it
[00:16:31] up quickly and and I just kind of I don't know it was I was wrestling in my mind I know while
[00:16:38] people will have their own opinions about it but it's probably one of the toughest I guess sports
[00:16:45] out there as far as physical fitness endurance and whatnot and that also leads into you know um
[00:16:50] a jujitsu and um Greco Roman and freestyle whatnot but um it also what it did for me was
[00:16:57] it kind of I already had that work ethic but it kind of like I mean you you have to get tough
[00:17:04] or are you just gonna get slaughtered on Matt and that's embarrassing because I've had it happened
[00:17:09] before what what weight did you wrestle at um so I wrestled I started off at one one twenty whatever
[00:17:19] it was one twenty one yeah and then my senior year um I cut weight down to 142 which um was
[00:17:30] yeah pretty hard but I was running from the 151 weight class because the kid there was just a beast
[00:17:35] and so I got weight down to 142 basically running from somebody and uh went to state and then you
[00:17:41] know did okay. Oh yeah well damn if you went to state in Oregon that's freaking legit. Yeah I was
[00:17:46] during the uh got just period and stuff like that so um we we had a pretty Oregon uh was nationally
[00:17:53] known for wrestling with you know like the gotchish brothers and whatnot but that's awesome man.
[00:17:58] Um here's a little story one day as we were kicking around my future you're talking about your
[00:18:06] dad he told me a story there were two old men sitting on their porch is staring out to the
[00:18:11] abyss they didn't know each other but they had one thing in common they were waiting on death
[00:18:17] I leaned in closer dad could always tell a good story but this was different he meant business
[00:18:22] one old man was miserable he had let life's chances pass him by and now thoughts of opportunities
[00:18:28] long gone were replaced with haunted ideas of what could have been the other old man was totally
[00:18:35] fulfilled by the life he had lived he had done everything there was to do and now he could sit back
[00:18:40] and relish his golden month moments and wonderful memories because he had lived life to the fullest
[00:18:46] so there you go son I wish I would have done this or that statements are a prison of misery for
[00:18:53] the mind you want to go through life and be perfectly content with the life you've lived you want to
[00:18:59] do everything there is to be done right or wrong you do it and never regret a decision you made
[00:19:06] this from a man who'd been off to war fought for his life seen the world given life taken life
[00:19:12] loved and had his heart broken he had made mistakes taken chances and failed and succeeded many times
[00:19:18] good or bad I can sit back and reminisce on my life and feel good about it he said when God tells
[00:19:23] me it's my time to go home I will leave this earth fulfilled because I've done it all and I want
[00:19:28] you to feel the same way so let me leave you with this thought what kind of old man do you want to be
[00:19:36] son freaking good guidance from the from from pops you know yeah that's that is pretty much
[00:19:46] that guidance right there is pretty much led you know half of the the decisions I've made my life
[00:19:53] whether or not I look back and I'm like wow I can't believe I'm alive from that most of what he said
[00:19:59] right there is the reason why you know I can look back and like wow that was I was really dumb
[00:20:03] let's try this again so and that's sort of what made you guys start talking about you going in the
[00:20:08] military I know you you check with an army recruiter you didn't even you didn't even think about the
[00:20:16] navy no that's the first so the basically out went down was my my teachers basically said hey
[00:20:26] you'll graduate if you join the military you are you are D.U.M. dumb like you need to go do something
[00:20:32] that the military will force you to all right so the air force they looked in my test scores and
[00:20:36] they're like no sorry man you're you're real cute but now the the army they actually didn't in the
[00:20:44] mid 90s they didn't need anybody it was crazy so they had like Patriot missile program and there's like a
[00:20:50] six month wait to get in and then the Marines came in and I got so angry and me now's like man you're
[00:20:58] scary I like I don't want to be in the ring you're scaring me and then so the navy recruiter
[00:21:04] I mean he might as well had on like a Hawaiian t-shirt what now but you know you want to you want to
[00:21:10] be an F-14 Tomcat pilot like Tom Cruise like yeah you want to be a navy seal like Charlie Sheans
[00:21:17] yeah you want to go to exotic ports and see exotic women and yeah he goes cool man sign here it's like
[00:21:24] all right I didn't I didn't fly in F-14 as anyone so so then you went to boot camp and look there's
[00:21:34] so much you cover this stuff in the book which is which is cool but I'm gonna jump through jump
[00:21:41] past some of that stuff you go on here you finally get to see being on board a ship with 900 other
[00:21:46] sailors and Marines all male in this deployment was a major culture shock and not for the
[00:21:50] F-14 heart especially for low and listed sailors like me working 16 hour days and doing maintenance
[00:21:56] duties like keeping the deck department and equipment in good condition loading and unloading cargo
[00:22:01] shining brass busting rust because of salt water and painting bulkheads walls and passageways
[00:22:07] the same battleship gray sucked what little free time I had was spending my coffin rack
[00:22:14] trying to get some much needed sleep tell us about a coffin rack what's at all about
[00:22:18] coffin racks yes so when people talk about quality of life in the military I just say
[00:22:25] if you've never lived on a ship that was commissioned in the 60s then I don't think you really
[00:22:31] understand what bad quality life is so cloth got what was worse the tent that you lived in or
[00:22:37] the ship board oh shit oh my far and the Marines had it even worse oh yeah they were I think they were
[00:22:43] stacked like six high down in the Marine Burthing Bayes or five high yeah well I did two deployments
[00:22:49] on amphib ships yeah both of them were built in like 1960 something like that they were built to
[00:22:55] transport troops over to the southeast Asia yeah and so you were supposed to be on them when they
[00:23:01] originally built this was put Marines on there for whatever a four week trip and then you'd get
[00:23:06] off and go do your work well by the time the 90s rolled around like what you're talking about here
[00:23:11] we were going on six six month deployments and and yes I stayed in the as a seal was staying in the
[00:23:16] Burthing where where the Marine stayed and so yeah there would be David we literally had the old
[00:23:22] school canvas racks the canvas strong between metal pipes yeah and then a little cheap freaking
[00:23:31] mattress on top of that and yeah it was just and you there before five high I think usually
[00:23:37] we would kind of adjust our our living space as seals we kind of like yeah we'd do some work in there
[00:23:43] so maybe it wouldn't be quite as bad but uh get some golf and rack sorry I cut you off no people yeah
[00:23:50] people don't understand but your your entire life so I've done um I was on you know the USS
[00:23:55] Shreaf port which was LPD 12 amphib boiler super old and then um you know the gloom I did some time
[00:24:02] on that and then the camden well the camden was commissioned in the 70s so it was super it was just
[00:24:09] this great upgrade but yeah the Shreaf port we we were in the Persian Gulf probably 10 months
[00:24:16] in 98 and um and then yeah it's your coffin rack like you have that thin mattress and then
[00:24:26] you open up the what the mattress sits on is basically a lid that you open up and now you have
[00:24:34] your your area your where your clothes go and you know everything else and it's just this tiny like
[00:24:42] it's it's it's coffin but even a coffin has more depth than a coffin rack does on board ship
[00:24:48] and so yeah that's that's here entire life and when you're in subdivision and you're lower
[00:24:54] and listed I mean we were stuck for high and and so it was and then you got you know you have your little
[00:24:59] curtain close the curtain and you know trying to get some sleeper whatnot and maybe
[00:25:05] kick the rack of the guy next to you and he's being too loud so you know you know all about it
[00:25:12] yeah no it's uh it's that's what's always surprising is you know when guys are going through
[00:25:17] the training and you know even if you even if you just hear about that you think well I don't that doesn't
[00:25:23] sound like a good deal I might be wet cold and sandy right now but that sounds like maybe I don't
[00:25:28] want to go do that uh this was I thought this was interesting so fast forward a little bit at the
[00:25:35] time the USS Cole was bombed I was on board my second ship the USS Camden we were then 12 hours
[00:25:41] of Yemen when the distress calls came out we sailed full steam ahead through the streets of
[00:25:46] Hormuz at along the USS along with the USS Donald Cook we would be the first American military
[00:25:52] personnel to arrive in assist the Cole crew in saving the ship and pulling bodies from the
[00:25:58] wreckage I'll never forget the smell of burning human flesh when I stepped on board the Cole
[00:26:02] for the next week we teamed up with Cole crew members to keep the ship from sinking and recovered
[00:26:08] the remains of all 17 heroes killed that day I was I had witnessed the first salvo in what would
[00:26:14] become known as the war on terror and our rescue and recovery effort with the USS Cole would
[00:26:19] impact my life in the years to come yeah you you definitely be in on a navy ship you feel
[00:26:28] very untouchable by the enemy for sure and especially in the 90s so that must have been a shocker
[00:26:33] I was a shocker for the world but for you to actually go there that's crazy yeah I've seen that
[00:26:39] I remember when we were on the we call Liberty boats but you know there were the barges taken us
[00:26:45] over to the Cole and just looking at that massive hole in the side of it that had just been
[00:26:52] blown in there about 18 hours prior it was yeah it's pretty intense it's you know you go from
[00:26:59] untouchable to all of a sudden you can't be touched and so and yeah it would set the path for
[00:27:05] you know my you know basically what I did in special operations and whatnot as a green beret
[00:27:11] and the enemy trying to kill me and that you know the the zip in the crack and you're not
[00:27:17] untouchable anymore and so yeah but that was the first first little idea I got of what of wow you
[00:27:24] know people they they do want to kill you yeah and that's a weird feeling yeah it takes a little
[00:27:31] getting used to spring in 2001 you get out get out of the navy you'd gotten married and again
[00:27:40] there's all kinds of good this is good some good life lessons learned in this book very good
[00:27:45] life lessons in this book so you get married you get out of the navy you actually married a girl
[00:27:51] that was in the army and so you get out you try a bunch of different jobs you end up as a bartender
[00:27:57] which echo supports September 11th happens and now you're feeling like you know hey maybe I
[00:28:09] want to go do something in the meantime I got to read this little section one day and early
[00:28:14] 2002 I received a phone call out of the blue hi is this Ryan Hendrickson yes who's this it's your
[00:28:20] big sister Chris remember me barely I thought our family had been separated when I was
[00:28:25] still in diapers I had two older half sisters Paula was five years old and Chris was eight
[00:28:31] years older I also had a half brother who's ten years older than me and lived with us periodically
[00:28:37] his name was Robbie both my dad and his first wife were heavy drinkers one night she swept up my
[00:28:42] older siblings and disappeared I had memories of them but I was so young I didn't really have a
[00:28:47] grasp of what had happened or who they were and now this phone call came out of the blue so that's
[00:28:52] that's kind of crazy yeah yeah that was that was something else and she wanted to contact me
[00:28:58] because she she basically said like you won't remember all the bad stuff so I'm gonna start off with you
[00:29:04] but it was when um is when that uh what is it not and sister DNA but whenever they're building
[00:29:12] your family trees or okay I like the genealogy type thing yeah so that's actually when everyone you
[00:29:18] know started getting connected back again and it was yeah it was it was crazy but my dad and
[00:29:25] I we made a trip now and the new Mexico to see him and that was the first time he saw his kids
[00:29:29] in years years and you know and then we just you know we started kind of building the bridges back
[00:29:38] and you know I learned I learned just how you know my dad like he lived the hard life you know
[00:29:46] and so I heard some of those stories and but that's that's the one thing that you know the
[00:29:54] people that are out there and they say you know people people never change or you you're not
[00:29:58] gonna change once your once alus are always alus or something like that and I look at my dad and
[00:30:03] I could be like I 100% disagree with you and you knew your dad as this guy that was kind of you know
[00:30:10] on such a good path in life was steering you in the right direction and then your older half-sister
[00:30:16] had stories that you almost seem like a different yeah she was talking about a different guy
[00:30:20] well I remember she said hey have you talked to dad lately and I was like yeah talking about
[00:30:26] the time he's a preacher and she goes no no no um Larry Hendricksson as yeah yeah he's a preacher
[00:30:32] she goes it's impossible wow he's like no it's not well that's crazy now during this time also
[00:30:43] you stayed in the navy reserves which means you were doing your one weekend among or whatever
[00:30:49] and then we go back to the book then an unexpected opportunity came up as a naval reserveist
[00:30:53] I could attend basic underwater demolition school at Naval Special Warfare training complex
[00:31:00] in Coronado California but six month long training class was part was the first part of navy
[00:31:05] seal training so if I ever wanted to become a seal and member of the naval special operations
[00:31:09] community basic underwater demolition school is where I had to start my wife Sarah knew that being
[00:31:14] part of special operations had always appealed to me now this opportunity was sitting right in front
[00:31:18] of me I had undergrown training as a rescue swimmer in the navy so I had assumed I had the swimming
[00:31:24] part down when I was approved to attend the six month bud's course visions of becoming a sealed
[00:31:30] danced in my head I quickly found out how tough it was during the first phase of training a pre-bud's
[00:31:36] training course that lasted around three weeks from there I went on to phase one which consisted
[00:31:42] of eight weeks of grueling exercise and conditioning topped off by hell week typically more than
[00:31:47] half the recruits wash out sheer fatigue and sleep deprivation caused every candidate to wonder what
[00:31:52] his limits are the non-stop beating that our bodies took from some of the hardest training the
[00:31:58] military has followed by long stretches of being cold wet and miserable with no time to recover
[00:32:03] took its toll when my body broke down from a leg injury in severe pneumonia I was dropped after
[00:32:09] three months of training I could have tried again after I recovered but I couldn't bring myself
[00:32:14] to go through all that shit again yeah so what was what was out like going through buds or
[00:32:20] attending buds yeah buds was I mean I was class two four two I have to say we were a beat down
[00:32:28] class that's that's just my opinion you know how they have the classes where some of them are
[00:32:35] oh man that's you guys got secured early from hell week what not the next class this man you
[00:32:39] guys are a beat down class or whatnot well we we had a beat down class and it was it was intense
[00:32:46] everything that they talk about it yeah I the only thing I could tell any listener who wants to
[00:32:53] contemplate that route is do it because it's an experience that you'll never forget they will make
[00:32:59] sure you will never forget it 100% those are worse part you think for you because you know different
[00:33:05] guys they dislike different things mm-hmm what do you think was the worst part for me the worst part
[00:33:13] actually once I got pneumonia I couldn't breathe and so on and so when we were doing
[00:33:20] drumperfine and whatnot like that I just my nose would just start you know opening up but
[00:33:26] I would I would have to say anything like on on the water fine under the water I don't I don't really
[00:33:34] like that I'm not a very big fan of that so when uh we'll we'll go back to the book here for the
[00:33:45] first time in my life I experienced a major setback becoming part of an elite unit with something
[00:33:51] I wanted with every inch of my being but I couldn't make the cut which prompted a series of questions
[00:33:56] why did I fail why wasn't I good enough how come my body broke down was I that weak I had no
[00:34:03] answers and I came up with every every poor me excuse in the book you'd think that for a guy who
[00:34:09] is raised the way I was excuses would be the last thing on my mind but they were my crutch I
[00:34:15] slowly but steadily turned myself into a victim if only I didn't grow up in a broken family if only
[00:34:21] the world and everyone in it weren't against me that just wasn't about buds but me not making it
[00:34:27] through brought my buried demons to the surface so even at this point you know you don't make it
[00:34:35] through buds and you kind of blame all these you know hate so because I was raised this way I
[00:34:42] hadn't used you know my death my mom wasn't around and you kind of make those excuses for yourself
[00:34:48] yeah I buried I buried myself in excuses and it it became very easy to do that it's very easy to
[00:34:55] to make somebody else the issue instead of looking deep inside and insane hey man just you know if
[00:35:04] if everyone can make it then it wouldn't be buds and so instead of understanding that you know I I did
[00:35:12] I took the it was it was more it was almost more entitlement then it was victim is like well this isn't fair
[00:35:19] why why didn't I make the cut and thing is I could have rolled back but I don't know how far did you make it
[00:35:28] all the way up to the end of the first phase so it was yeah it is basically they wanted me to go
[00:35:35] back to day one of phase one and I was just like and you know I just I didn't have it in me so
[00:35:42] but yeah it's you know it's it's one of those things I look back on you know and I I do I don't ever regret anything
[00:35:50] but it is one of those things around like yeah you kind of you kind of fluck that one of you know
[00:35:58] so yeah well you know when you say you had a beat down class more than other people it's like
[00:36:04] I'm gonna tell you the classes are beat down classes yeah they are beat down classes you're gonna
[00:36:10] get beat down you know I was over there a few months ago with one of my friends it still works over there
[00:36:16] and you know he was like there's there's whatever there's like a hundred helmets by the bell
[00:36:23] and um and he goes every single one of those guys is a stud that wanted to be he
[00:36:27] hints every season like almost every single one of those guys is a total stud that showed up here
[00:36:31] thinking they were gonna be a seal and they rang that bell man and he goes I go it's crazy he's he's like
[00:36:36] it's it's crazy that's the way it is it's a crazy process it's a crazy machine yep
[00:36:45] so now you and Sarah she's done in the army you you you're you're now out of the navy and
[00:36:55] well here we'll go to the book everything was perfect so you're a Minnesota and that's because
[00:36:59] that's where her family's from yeah so you're a Minnesota everything was perfect except for one major
[00:37:03] problem I could not overcome my immaturity and my sense of being a victim when I refuse to take
[00:37:09] responsibility for my actions I drank partied and ran my marriage into the ground I used
[00:37:14] whatever excuses I could find so you're just on a bad path at this point yeah it's uh I was on a
[00:37:23] years long bender like I don't think guns and roses go to helld up with me yeah uh you get the idea
[00:37:31] that you should go back in the military um you obviously don't want to be in the navy your wife
[00:37:36] was in the army so maybe you're thinking the army's about idea so you go back and check it check
[00:37:41] the air force mm-hmm uh you go here I looked at air force special operations combat control
[00:37:49] and jumped feet first into training I buried myself in every aspect of the course until a medical
[00:37:53] review of my record showed I had taken depression medication while in the navy a lot of people
[00:37:58] need prescriptions anti-depressants and depression ran in my family anti-depressant medication
[00:38:03] and counseling helped me through a very dark period of my life but this detour came back to bite
[00:38:08] me the air force decided that I was not medically qualified for special operations and put me in a
[00:38:13] job where they needed bodies I was told I would become an amunition specialist or ammo troop
[00:38:20] so you did they had you already enlisted when you did you did you had you already enlisted when you were
[00:38:27] gonna try for for uh cc-t yes yeah I was already I mean I was already a couple months into the training
[00:38:34] oh you are actually in the air force yeah going through cct train yeah I was at air
[00:38:39] traffic control school dang and then they told you no yeah I mean the depression medication it you know
[00:38:47] it had helped me out through you know some events in my life or whatnot the one time I did it
[00:38:53] and um and but back in those days and I'm not making excuses for but back in those days you know
[00:39:00] the go to for counselors or whatnot is here take this take this take this and so it's okay I'll take this
[00:39:08] was that when you were in the navy so then you were taking a navy prescribed thing and they
[00:39:13] they told you no even though you're taking something I was prescribed by the navy well I had gone out
[00:39:18] for civilian counseling yeah but I had reported it all you know like you're supposed to
[00:39:26] and but yeah I was I mean it's just back in the days when it was easier to medicate than to actually
[00:39:33] you know kind of um face your issues and fix them man up and do the right thing it's just easier
[00:39:40] to take some pills and go to go to the spirit world I guess but yeah it came back and got me so but
[00:39:50] you know it's you know there's there's a path for everybody in life and and I firmly believe that
[00:39:58] you know the way my life paned out um I it was this this is the path that was gonna happen
[00:40:06] way before I was I was ever born I believe I'm you know God had this path laid out and you know
[00:40:13] I was gonna take some bumps and bruises along the way some big ones but you know now you know
[00:40:19] to the point where I'm at right now so you know I still make my mistakes I'm a man but you know
[00:40:25] I think I'm doing a lot better right you know building up people around me instead of tearing them down
[00:40:30] like one of the destructive paths I was on you know in my life so yeah I know that some
[00:40:35] well that's one of the best things about this whole story is when you look at something you took
[00:40:39] some major you know like but right there right those two things you didn't make it through
[00:40:44] buds and then you try for air force, combat control and you don't get that either like those are two
[00:40:50] things that people like that's that could be the last straw one of those things could be the last
[00:40:55] straw I mean and you've already been through the hard childhood so any of these things could be
[00:41:00] something that completely derail someone's life and and yet you're sitting here so um well let's
[00:41:07] continue let's continue that telling this story of your path so you get stationed in Idaho your
[00:41:13] an ammo guy you end up going on deployment to Qatar while in your in Qatar you're loading up
[00:41:19] aircraft that are going to drop in bombs oh yeah they were they were winchestered every night they
[00:41:24] had come back winchester what you was that 2003 okay you get divorced now you go to Iraq in 2005
[00:41:38] you're in Kirkuk and you say this Iraq was the first place out I was exposed to US Army special
[00:41:45] forces the Green Barais these bearded shaggy haired men seemed to play by their own rules we would
[00:41:51] see them walking by and later that night when the rest of us were hanging out after dinner the
[00:41:55] stories of what we thought we knew about these guys would spill out you end up in the you end up in
[00:42:00] the gym one time you're lifting and a guy says you know hey can you spot me and you look over it's
[00:42:07] it's this green baray as name is Johnny days later he introduced me to guys on his team one guy in
[00:42:12] particular a due-name Gary was in the air force before going into the army this got the wheels in
[00:42:17] my head turning what if I tried to become a green baray could I do it do I have what it takes my
[00:42:22] failure at buds was never far from my mind when I contemplated my future one thing was for sure
[00:42:28] I did not want to be an old man sitting on my porch wondering about what might have been
[00:42:35] so you go to Iraq as you're you're when you get back from Iraq you take some leave you go to
[00:42:43] dude you're you freaking get after you were talking earlier about like you not leaving not leaving any
[00:42:48] any stone unturned you you do some serious traveling you go to you go to Vietnam you go to Ho Chi Minh city
[00:42:55] in the maycon delta and you got all really cool stories about all that stuff in here um you come back
[00:43:03] from that you're in Idaho and and again you know you're kind of drinking you're not feeling like
[00:43:11] your path you're on the right path you go on you go on a trip to Europe you go you end up going to Korea
[00:43:19] you get you end up going for it was that a one year deployment to Korea yes and this is still an air
[00:43:23] force deployment you're over there doing what an ammo specialist does yeah and plan rugby
[00:43:30] and play rugby uh you go while you're over there you go to you go to you go to bank
[00:43:38] ox or you go to Thailand you go to China you go to Cambodia I mean you're bro you you're getting after
[00:43:44] which we do military travel you do in civilian travel so that was that was for my leave um so the
[00:43:50] 30 days of leave or whatnot like that but um but yeah so Vietnam that was civilian backpacking
[00:43:57] around Europe that was civilian everything was civilian travel and it was just trying to I don't know
[00:44:03] I think I don't really know if I was running from things more than you know I was just trying to figure out
[00:44:08] you know who who I was because I I had no I had no direction um you know I had um I had my time
[00:44:16] in the Navy time in the air force divorced which you know I I'm surprised she she made it that long
[00:44:22] she's fighter but it is what it is so um I ran that one into the ground um and I I think I just
[00:44:30] buried myself in everything that I could possibly do just to kind of like keep my mind off of the
[00:44:36] fact that you know I was turning into that I was turning myself into a loser basically you know and
[00:44:42] it was becoming easier and easier to give up and um and I I still I had that um I had
[00:44:50] buds in the back of my head the entire time and um it just I don't know as I really had I I guess
[00:44:57] uh come to Jesus moment when I started realizing that given up was becoming almost natural because I was
[00:45:04] as the entitled victim everything was someone else's fault um and create you end up with a
[00:45:13] girl named Jessica which is not a real name but you end up with a girl called Jessica and here
[00:45:18] and you're just partnering and you're boozing and you and Jessica I mean this is like the couple
[00:45:26] that we all knew when they were when how old are you at this point uh early 20s yeah so this is like
[00:45:32] you know the couple that fighting and yelling each other and then all of a sudden they're you know they're
[00:45:36] going to the club that just like you know I can I can I can see that scene yep uh and of course
[00:45:45] you guys decide you need to get married yep uh which ends up in a pretty quick divorce and at this
[00:45:54] point you you you write this in the book I needed a win a big win I was never the type to give up
[00:46:00] but with two blown marriages a failed attempt to become a navy seal and a feeling that I hadn't
[00:46:05] found my calling in life I was just settling and letting life run me ragged I needed to reset my
[00:46:10] failures with a major victory that was when I decided that there would be no more losing it was time
[00:46:16] to start winning again at the time the air force was overmaned in certain jobs ammo being one of them
[00:46:23] the army had a shortage of soldiers in certain career fields so the air force was offering a
[00:46:29] direct transfer to the army one thing my dad had told me years earlier kept nagging me if you
[00:46:36] don't try you'll never know and if you never know it's because you didn't try the answer was
[00:46:42] clear I wasn't going to live a life of regrets even if the high risk of failure was there
[00:46:47] after clearing my head I decided to jump head first eyes closed into the unknown that's you know
[00:46:58] you want to talk about there being a plan the fact that the air force was overmaned and the
[00:47:01] army would just do a direct transfer yeah it was it was it was insane because I was going to the
[00:47:09] to the S1 or the personnel office whatever to update some stuff for promotion and there was this
[00:47:15] poster on the wall and it had this guy in two uniforms half of them was an air um air force uniform
[00:47:22] the other half was you know class A's army said blue to green and that's and it it all kind of fell
[00:47:30] within the same time frame as you know I need a victory I need I need something because right now
[00:47:36] you know my I am I'm 100% heading down the path of
[00:47:42] that I that I probably won't be able to recover from if I keep you know because it's
[00:47:48] everything's in excuse and everything's everyone else as well and entitlement and victimization
[00:47:55] and I was I was I still wasn't far enough down the path to where I couldn't recognize that I
[00:48:02] totally became a victim of life you know shitty circumstances and so I was I was still
[00:48:09] able to see like all right you need a victory you need something you got to hold a lot of
[00:48:15] zeros going you need a one you know it's weird I'm what whenever I talk of that some people
[00:48:20] especially when people get out I'm like when you get out of the when you get out of the military you
[00:48:24] need a new mission you need to have something else to focus on but what's weird about this
[00:48:28] is you are in the military but the mission that you had whatever that mission was it like wasn't
[00:48:34] bringing you the satisfaction you didn't feel like it was what you should be doing you know you
[00:48:39] knew that you had more to offer and so you're traveling around you're looking for you're looking
[00:48:44] for the mission and you just couldn't find it and so then what this is the same thing that happens
[00:48:48] when guys get out and they don't have a mission to know the sun they just go down path of
[00:48:51] least resistance and well bottle the pills or whatever and it ends up bad you are still in while
[00:48:58] you are having that go on and luckily they had this opportunity to go in the army man so you
[00:49:05] went to army boot camp and you you talk about that and here was that was that a little bit of a
[00:49:10] gentleman's course do you if you heard the term gentleman's course before I have yeah okay so it was your
[00:49:15] boot camp like a gentleman's course which in the military a gentleman's course is it's basically
[00:49:21] there it's basically you're there to actually learn it's not like this be down thing you're
[00:49:28] going to actually learn stuff you get treated like a human you're not getting treated like a like a
[00:49:33] you know new guy piece of shit whatever you're getting treated well and you're there to learn that's
[00:49:38] a gentleman's course for instance I went to officer candidate school with all the other
[00:49:46] people coming out of college that go to officer candidate school that's not a gentleman's course
[00:49:50] like you go and you get all the full benefit of people the audience screaming to you but
[00:49:56] for worn officers or limited duty officers in the navy they go to a gentleman's course where
[00:50:02] hey here's how you wear the uniform and here's here's what here's how you write these reports it's
[00:50:06] like a nice transition yeah sounds like yours was somewhere in between you kind of had to go to boot
[00:50:12] camp a little bit but they were being cool to you so yeah infantry basic was that there's two
[00:50:19] things that happened there number one so I had I had done the the prior service
[00:50:25] course that they had for us in New Mexico which was supposed it was supposed to suffice as
[00:50:32] you know that was the phase one of infantry basic then you go to a IT
[00:50:36] you when you say infantry basic is that boot camp straight up boot camp so you went to his
[00:50:42] class in New Mexico how long was that course that was a month and then okay normal army boot camp
[00:50:49] is what 12 weeks yeah I think so they gave you a little short in course where they cool to you
[00:50:54] or where they yell in the screaming so new Mexico they can't really yell in the screaming
[00:50:58] bunch of you know they're a bunch of guard guys that were kind of which no offense
[00:51:02] definitely but they they were just there to check the boxes on us so they're there to actually
[00:51:10] transition you okay this is the way it works in the army here's how you wear uniform in the army
[00:51:14] these are the roles responsibility so it was it was a gentleman's course yeah that that was and then
[00:51:19] I get the bending for infantry and apparently I didn't get the memo that I was supposed to wait
[00:51:25] for a it so I started basic with everyone else and so the drone instructor he came up to me
[00:51:35] he's hey man you're not supposed to be here and I basically told him like I need this you know
[00:51:42] I need something to bury completely just focus everything I got on it bury all of my efforts
[00:51:49] into into into a cause and and I loved it like I loved it and he's like hey you know we're
[00:51:57] you're gonna have to play the game then I was like I'll play the game I got I got nothing but time
[00:52:02] so it was awesome I loved it and so I would think for a private going through when I went through
[00:52:09] they probably would say it was not a gentleman's course but for me going through basic you know
[00:52:16] our infantry basic and whatnot like that it was it was exactly what I needed at that point
[00:52:22] time every day was awesome and it just kept my mind off of everything that I just went through
[00:52:28] everything so but still didn't fix it just kept my mind off it you end up so you go through that
[00:52:37] infantry basic you go through a it you go to airborne then you start the 18x which is when you
[00:52:45] go in in special forces and you're not exactly sure which specialty you're gonna get they call it 18x
[00:52:52] and you go to this 18x prep course and you say this 18x prep course was extremely hard and
[00:53:01] pushed me to my limits I'm talking nonstop physical training 12 hours per day getting beat down
[00:53:06] the intent to the prep program was not only to get a soldier ready mentally and physically for
[00:53:11] selection but also to weed out the week so how long is that prep course it depends but our
[00:53:21] 18x or the prep course for selection I think ours was a month so four weeks and then from prep
[00:53:28] course you go to special forces selection yes so prep course is literally just to get you ready like
[00:53:34] yes hard PT's and they're trying to get you in good physical shape to be ready for
[00:53:41] for special forces selection yes or to help you understand that this isn't really what you want
[00:53:48] and so they don't blow a bunch of money training you they can just send you over to the 80
[00:53:52] second really quick got it and move on with life got it so now you get to special forces selection
[00:53:57] I'm gonna go to the book this was do or die time an 18 day gut check to pull out all the
[00:54:02] stops there was no way I would accept failure because I didn't think I could handle another
[00:54:06] fuck up in my life this was most likely my only chance and I was gonna make it happen everything
[00:54:11] that I had been through all the hard work I put in everything led up to this point selection as soon
[00:54:15] as we stepped off the buses at Camp McCall it was game on we started with the usual army PT test
[00:54:20] a readiness assessment also known as the army physical fitness test to my surprise some soldiers
[00:54:26] showed up for a shot to be the best failed the first PT test and we're gone on day zero fast
[00:54:33] forward a little time was flying by for me and I was killing it regardless of whether it was a 10
[00:54:36] mile run along Sandy backwards roads a 10k rock sack march with 60 pounds on my back a 12
[00:54:43] mile land navigation course rifle PT log PT with telephone poles or the dreaded team week events
[00:54:49] that broke the will of most of the trainees I was speeding through as excruciating as
[00:54:54] everything was I was amazed at how well I was doing the 18x prep course lived up to his name
[00:54:59] so you're kind of getting after it do good yeah we were constantly on the move 18 to 20 hours
[00:55:06] a day whether it was a ballbuster PT session or hustling from one event the other
[00:55:10] shot I came in snatches and meals were always on the go not getting enough food for me with
[00:55:16] not getting enough food for the number of calories I was burning took its toll after the first
[00:55:21] week but I didn't care while the lack of calories depleted my energy and strength that combined
[00:55:25] with my lack of sleep was all part of the mentally and physically breaking down a trainee so you're
[00:55:31] not eating very much which is one thing that I was was happy that I ended up in the navy and
[00:55:37] and going to budd instead of any of the army courses where you don't get to eat man yeah the
[00:55:42] the army seems to they they they really like the whole you don't need to eat thing yeah
[00:55:47] yeah the navy focuses on you don't need to sleep and and also you don't need to be warm which
[00:55:54] look range of school and freaking sf school you know it's not like you're warm cuddly there
[00:55:59] either now no the uh just beat down we just we're not under the water and that was good
[00:56:08] as the days turned into weeks our bodies are breaking down so I pressed on as we near the end
[00:56:12] the final major obstacle in my way was along rut march we weren't supposed to know the distance
[00:56:17] of the final trek but every selection class got the scoop from the guys are gone before we would
[00:56:20] be going 25 to 30 miles turned out you guys went more than 25 to 30 miles again I'm jumping
[00:56:28] you you give some really cool information and that's why people should get the book fast
[00:56:33] foreign a little bit after hitting the finish line we gathered in a large conference hall to
[00:56:37] hear who got selected and who didn't I could barely put one foot in front of the other but at
[00:56:41] least I walked in under my own power those left standing after the dust cleared look like they
[00:56:45] had spent years as POWs most of the guys hobbled and limp their way into the conference hall
[00:56:51] beaten down and on edge as I took my seat my tired head was filled with questions will all this
[00:56:58] physical and mental effort be for nothing did I give it the best I could do I have what they are
[00:57:03] looking for after a wait that seemed like days the selection cadre entered the hall to call
[00:57:08] off the roster numbers of the guys selected I was roster number 049 out of 185 as you went down
[00:57:15] the list he reached those in the 40s I held my breath and closed my eyes roster number 049
[00:57:23] selected I melted into my chairs the reef spread over my body out of 185 only 50 or so men were
[00:57:31] selected a little more than one out of every four I was one of them but I wasn't there yet I still
[00:57:36] had more hurdles in front of me out of the 50 of us who would advance to the qualification course
[00:57:41] less than half would become green berets those concerns didn't matter to me at that point however
[00:57:46] for now I saved my accomplishment I was on my way so you you do this freaking all this training
[00:57:52] of selection to how long selection 18 days yeah it varies there's some three week selections
[00:57:57] and whatnot but yeah I had an 18 day selection and then even if you pass everything you can still
[00:58:04] just not get selected yes there was a lot of those guys who they said hey thank you for coming out
[00:58:10] um you're just not what we're looking for good luck damn so you're sitting in there with your
[00:58:17] freaking fingers crossed yeah yeah dang yeah do you have any idea what they're like what is
[00:58:24] the kind of thing where they're saying that this guy's not not for us so the cause I would be pissed
[00:58:30] yeah some of the lessons that I've learned and some of the things that you know I can I think
[00:58:37] make a good operator regardless of what special operations unit you're with is a guy who's always
[00:58:44] looking for work you're never stagnant look for work a guy who's always willing to carry the
[00:58:49] heaviest shit look for work carry heavy stuff and then the guy who he just regardless of how
[00:58:58] bad at hurts smile because you're making memories that you're you're just you're not you can never
[00:59:06] recreate it ever so look for work carry heavy stuff and smile yeah that's very good advice
[00:59:13] we used to actually we used to tell guys you know especially when I was running training that was one
[00:59:18] of the things we tell guys is look for work even in a tactical sense like hey you're sitting there
[00:59:23] with your weapon pointed down the ground bro look for work go find something to cover go find some
[00:59:27] hold security somewhere you look for work makes something happen and that's right in there I mean
[00:59:32] that's almost the same thing as carry heavy shit yeah don't be the guy that's trying to
[00:59:37] shark that yep if if the two 40s on the ground and everyone's moving to a different weapon system
[00:59:43] grabbed the two 40 because I can promise you one thing it will not be the heaviest thing you'll
[00:59:49] carry in combat training can't touch a combat load yeah no doubt so from there you go to the Q course
[00:59:59] and I guess in route to Q course or part of the Q course the Q course is like a whole bunch of things
[01:00:05] racked up together right yes right so you do sear school you do sear sea school you you go to
[01:00:12] language school which you did Spanish yes and and well this was kind of funny you're like
[01:00:20] before selection I was given a language aptitude test my score determined the difficulty of the
[01:00:24] language I would learn well let's just say that Ryan Hendrickson's test results were modest at
[01:00:29] best and I would not be learning Arabic or Mandarin Chinese so no so you also said this you
[01:00:37] would joke with your friends where you're taking Spanish I can barely speak American let alone Mexican
[01:00:43] teacher denoling so then you go to Robin Sage and Robin Sage is this famous green
[01:00:50] bra exercise that you do at the end of the Q course over a period of three weeks we would plan
[01:00:55] in full train advise and assist a resistance movement that on some level back the United States
[01:01:00] and was seeking to defeat the occupying repressive forces in Pineland which is a made-up place in
[01:01:06] Western North Carolina this would be by far the most realistic military exercise to prepare men
[01:01:11] for what we would actually encounter while deployed when times were hard and I needed a
[01:01:17] pull strength from somewhere anywhere I would see someone in the course where I thought
[01:01:21] who I thought had no business being there someone who is riding the coat tails of others
[01:01:26] performing only when the spotlight was on him I would pick these guys out and think I'm not going
[01:01:31] anywhere if this guy is still here I'm better than this shit bag and I will outlast him no
[01:01:37] matter what then that guy would fail or quit and I would target someone else I knew that I was
[01:01:42] better than I would use their weaknesses to make me stronger in a crazy way I fed off their failures
[01:01:48] be bad good or indifferent this was the mindset I used to keep pushing myself just I mean
[01:01:58] well for me when people were quitting I would always like damn what a loser
[01:02:06] I guess I had a little bit of that and there was a couple people that surprised me when they quit
[01:02:11] there was one guy in my bloods class that was like a he had gone to buds before he was in E5
[01:02:18] he was probably like 25 or 26 years old which seemed pretty freaking old to me and like mature
[01:02:23] because I was still like not you know I don't think it all he's got this stuff off and he would
[01:02:28] give me advice like hey we need structures to do this you know and you need to keep this
[01:02:32] mine I was like okay you know sounds good and then in freaking first night of hell week he quits
[01:02:40] and I was like what you can what's your problem but the same thing I was kind of like all right
[01:02:46] well I'm definitely not quitting this freaking loser so then for 84 weeks that's 20 months from
[01:02:54] start to finish my tired and broken body performed at levels I didn't think we're possible I
[01:02:58] pushed myself to my limits and through to the end life had dealt me some major brod blows
[01:03:03] and no one knew better than me that I dug a hole for myself that was damn near impossible to get
[01:03:08] out of despite how much I had fucked things up I had pulled myself out of a pit started something
[01:03:13] and seen it through it to the end leaving nothing behind I'd given this everything and I had succeeded
[01:03:19] now as a green beret radar right the next chapter of my life damn that's already a like one full
[01:03:25] book right there just needed one victory yeah that's it damn um and I like what you said earlier you
[01:03:32] know you're talking about your dad being like able to turn himself around and that's the same
[01:03:37] you know it's the same story for you too you know you're going from a horrible spot where you've
[01:03:42] racked up some some failures and then you just get it together get focused and you win you start winning
[01:03:50] fast forward a little bit okay here's the sergeant major talking you're checking in okay
[01:03:55] you're the new 18 Charlie I've been waiting for I'm assigning you to ODA 7215 I knew the 7
[01:04:03] stood for 7th special forces the two for 2nd battalion the one for Alpha Company and the 5 for 15 in the
[01:04:10] company I knew my job as an 18 Charlie what talk about what an 18 Charlie is so 18 Charlie is a
[01:04:20] a demolition expert on ODA and we you know we have the different MLSs like the 18 Bravo weapon
[01:04:27] weapons expert 18 echo comms Charlie demolitions and also construction but state side you are a
[01:04:36] a a special forces supply guy is it technically engineering yep so that's what the Charlie is
[01:04:44] yep and then you know the fox intel and you know team siren to Zulu and whatnot like that and delta
[01:04:49] medical so hmm so you say this and this is a weird thing because you don't think when you think
[01:04:56] engineers you think building and and constructing and this happens in Marine Corps too engineers
[01:05:03] becomes the people at handle IEDs so I knew my job as an 18 Charlie wasn't for the faint heart
[01:05:09] while patrolling an enemy hell day areas of Afghanistan I would find myself upfront the tip of the spear one
[01:05:14] might say with 3 to 5 Afghan counterparts who specialize in counter ID operations and we're very
[01:05:21] good at finding them we would be exposed to Taliban snipers or any run the mill dumbass
[01:05:25] waiting wanting to take a shot at us the worst part of being the man upfront was that I would be the
[01:05:30] first soldier to encounter the IEDs I'd rather be in a firefight with a Taliban any day the
[01:05:35] week than deal with IEDs which were a nasty but very effective way to fight a war one of the senior
[01:05:41] one of the more senior guys in the back corner spoke up you got a lot to learn in a little bit of
[01:05:45] time sit down and listen but most of all keep your mouth shut keep your eyes open this will be a
[01:05:49] fire hose and you get man you do a good job in the book of of talking about the team and checking
[01:05:56] into the team and you're a new guy and you go through all that stuff but we're gonna skip through
[01:06:01] that and people need to buy the book to get that information I'm going straight to Afghanistan
[01:06:06] you're heading toward an outpost the outpost is called the alamo which is always a good sign
[01:06:13] yeah not sure what happened there but I don't think it ended up very well
[01:06:18] so here you are oh shit not only was I my first mission as a green beret but I was walking into a
[01:06:25] live combat situation could you guys have heard gunfire this wasn't a video game real 762
[01:06:30] caliber bullets would be flying this caliber of bullet would easily rip a hole the size of a
[01:06:34] silver dollar through a man's torso and tears internal organs to shreds we wore a body
[01:06:39] armor that gave some protection to our chest and upper backs but when a bullet penetrated the
[01:06:43] chest cavity nine times out of ten you were dead I was driving the lead vehicle when our convoy arrived
[01:06:49] at the last stopping point around a thousand meters from the alamo a call came over to vehicle
[01:06:54] radio communications all vehicles stop during our pre-mission brief that morning I remember being told
[01:07:00] that we would have to make a mad dash over a one kilometer over one kilometer of open ground to
[01:07:05] reach the safety of the alamo so we needed to be prepared for that the alamo was surrounded by a
[01:07:10] you shaped ridge line a finger like natural rock structure that ran toward the helmet river
[01:07:17] then the call came over the radio all vehicles move I hit the gas on my RG 33
[01:07:22] mind resistant vehicle and started covering ground within seconds a Taliban machine gun crew started
[01:07:27] sending rounds our way I heard pigs from the bullets hitting our truck thank god the RG 33 was armored
[01:07:33] sprays of dirt and dust from incoming bullets and golfed our vehicle my senses shot up to overdrive
[01:07:38] and adrenaline pump through my veins even though I was scared I had never felt so alive as I
[01:07:43] concentrated on keeping the heavy vehicle moving forward then crack we'd been hit the front
[01:07:48] windshield split in a hundred different directions like a spider's web crack crack two more
[01:07:53] hand at rounds hit my windshield I didn't know how many more rounds this windshield could take
[01:07:57] drive my captain yelled from the front passenger seat we got to get the fuck off this open ground
[01:08:02] I jam the gas pedal to the floor board and push the RG 33 to its limits limits and RG 33 ways
[01:08:09] around 38,000 pounds so maneuvering such a large bullet magnet over a thousand meters of of uneven
[01:08:15] rough terrain was no easy task I managed to rumble to safety through the alamo single entrance gate
[01:08:21] in into a large courtyard the other two vehicles arrived safely as well almost as soon as my RG 33
[01:08:26] stopped in the courtyard I jumped out and ran to the nearest elevated position in the compound I
[01:08:31] toggled the selector switch on my m4 carbine from safe to fire and started sending rounds down range
[01:08:36] toward the enemy for the next few hours we exchanged sporadic gunfire but I have to admit
[01:08:41] that it was hard to think clearly adrenaline had really taken over my body at that point training
[01:08:47] kicked in and I reacted with muscle memory that had been honed through hundreds of hours spent
[01:08:51] training for combat when my first battle experience was over I couldn't get my hands to quit
[01:08:56] shaking my nerves were tingling as well but I felt good the question of how I would react when bullets
[01:09:01] were flying had been answered that evening some of the guys looked at the damage on my vehicle
[01:09:06] we could see where the rounds hit even though bullets hadn't made holes but the indentations were
[01:09:12] everywhere damn one more round hitting your windshield and it was gone one of my teammates said you
[01:09:17] had been fucked up you got that right I said looks like you got your C.I.B. bro joked another buddy
[01:09:23] which is the combat every three minutes jet badge that they're telling you yeah you just got it so
[01:09:28] there's your welcome to combat yeah that was a day three day three and that that happened and it was
[01:09:38] it was awesome it was awesome I mean it's hard to explain it it was so awesome that it you know it's
[01:09:45] it's a dicking you know combat's it's a rush so that's and I got that day three yeah
[01:09:52] yeah that's a that's a good welcome there it's it's I remember the first time I went into
[01:09:57] I don't know it was an RG 33 for was one eight I think it was an RG 33 I was out there was one other vehicle
[01:10:04] I forget the name of it so they had so the Mac the Mac these the RG 31s they also have the
[01:10:14] MATVs or the Mac's I think it was a 33 but I remember driving through Ramani's I had
[01:10:21] probably been in Ramani for like a month at this point and all of the to all of my transits would
[01:10:25] be either in a Bradley which you can't see anything or in a humvee which you can barely see
[01:10:30] in your all freaking having to scan so the first time I rolled down route Michigan in an RG 33
[01:10:35] sitting at like 15 feet with the white lights on and the big giant bulletproof windows it's like
[01:10:40] the coolest thing ever you're like oh I'm good I can figure and you can look around and you can like
[01:10:45] really pay attention so that's that's it that's a good feeling as opposed to a humvee where
[01:10:51] it's awaiting to suck start an idea and yeah yeah so now you guys are doing rotations out at this
[01:10:59] place the album it's like a forward operating base yeah it was a it was a cop yeah basically we took
[01:11:04] over a compound ill check in farm goat cow whatever compound and turned it into basically
[01:11:15] where we were going to conduct operations engage in Taliban forces along the Hellman river
[01:11:19] you say I learned quickly that 90% of a deployment was sheer boredom followed by 10% of heart racing
[01:11:24] terror and excitement each rusher combat left me craving more there was something about the
[01:11:31] kill or be killed aspect of fighting the game you high high that was dangerously adicting
[01:11:38] during my first three months in Afghanistan my detachment saw combat got caught in several intense
[01:11:43] fire fights but we didn't take any casualties the rest of the men of alpha company second battalion
[01:11:48] however 2010 was proving to be one hell of a deadly deployment two men on a different detachment
[01:11:54] were killed in action including one of our air force counterparts and more than a dozen were
[01:11:59] wounded normally a deployment to Afghanistan resulted in four or five wounded guys and maybe one
[01:12:04] fallen soldier but our company more than doubled or tripled that amount one afternoon our
[01:12:09] team leader approached me to tell me that a friend of mine named Jason had been killed in action
[01:12:13] that day in a different part of Afghanistan Jason died in a V Jason died when his vehicle had
[01:12:19] an ID he said bam man this shit sucks are you gonna be okay I absorbed the emotional blow
[01:12:26] yeah I'm good I said even though my chest was closing in I hadn't known Jason that long but we had
[01:12:31] gone through a large portion of special forces training together back at four brag it's through
[01:12:36] training that you really get to know someone I knew I could always count on Jason for help
[01:12:40] there were times I felt like I was a fish out of water coming over from the air force the army
[01:12:45] but Jason took the time to help me whenever I got hung up on one ever part of training I was stuck
[01:12:49] with Jason was someone I looked up to I admired how everything was easy for him he was smart and
[01:12:54] great shape a super dad to his kids and amazing husband to his wife but just two months into his
[01:12:59] first deployment as a green beret he was dead in the past I had heard about guys from a different
[01:13:07] battalion or unit dying and I rack her Afghanistan but this was the first time I knew someone personally
[01:13:13] death in combat was not just something I saw in the news now it was personal Jason was my friend
[01:13:18] and this was the ugly reality of war I tried my best not to think about Jason's death too much
[01:13:26] which was difficult I knew full well that Afghanistan was not the place to mourn the death of
[01:13:32] friends there would be plenty of time back in the states to think about that and try to come to terms
[01:13:37] with it I still had a job to do to make sure no one on my team stepped on an IED and a promise
[01:13:42] to fulfill to myself I would do whatever it took to make sure my teammates returned with to their
[01:13:47] families in one piece in 2010 though Afghanistan was not getting safer and the real fighting
[01:13:55] had yet to begin how long did you guys been on deployment for at that point
[01:14:04] so when Jason was killed I think we both got in the country at the same time and so that would be
[01:14:12] two months and how long are you how long were your deployments at this point um they were
[01:14:17] they varied but most of them were nine months at that at that point so you're only two months into
[01:14:25] a nine month deployment you've already your your battalions lost a bunch of guys your companies
[01:14:32] how did guys wounded and killed that your friend gets killed go and back to the book when
[01:14:41] summer was coming to a close my team along with other ODAs from our company was tasked with
[01:14:45] entering Choo-Too Valley I say that right yep from different locations and clearing out the
[01:14:51] Taliban to a central point which would send the bastards running for the mountains working against us
[01:14:55] however was the fact that this was not a covert mission everyone up and down the valley knew we were
[01:15:00] coming which gave the Taliban ample time to place IEDs and prepare for us so you go you talk through
[01:15:09] some of the planning and finally you guys go to execute this mission the date was September 10th
[01:15:15] 2010 each of us was carrying a different equipment carrying different equipment for the mission
[01:15:20] besides my body armor and amphal rifle I was toting a 60 pound assault pack on my back filled
[01:15:25] with ammunition demolition material food water extra batteries and whatever else I would need
[01:15:30] for three days my average fighting weight was 200 pounds but with body armor weapons ammo and my
[01:15:35] assault pack I probably took the scales at 280 280s being generous yeah
[01:15:50] you say during our final pre-mescent checks I had time to let my mind wander
[01:15:55] what will be out there waiting for us do they know we're coming how hard will it be to find
[01:16:02] IEDs how I react on the bullet start flying all these questions plagued my mind as I was
[01:16:07] watching the river flow in the light of the moon until it disappeared into the darkness this
[01:16:11] seemed like a good moment to take out a small pad of paper from my assault pack and write a quick
[01:16:16] note from my family in case the worst happened dad when he Paul a Chris and Robbie I hope I made you
[01:16:23] proud if you're reading this note I did not make it death doesn't really scare me because I'm
[01:16:31] doing what I believe is right and just I guess that's really all you can ask from a man death comes
[01:16:38] to everyone at some point in life so there's no use fighting it when it's your time it's your time
[01:16:44] and there's nothing you can do about it I believe I live as good a life as possible and I'm asking
[01:16:50] you not to stay sad very long very soon you will be joining me in heaven and we will again be together
[01:16:58] I'll keep the beer cold for you all I love you Ryan I don't know why I chose to write this note
[01:17:08] maybe it was the fact that I was a new guy and had no clue what would happen on my first patrol
[01:17:12] that far from the alamo maybe I had seen too many warm moves and figured this was a good idea
[01:17:18] maybe deep down I really believe that this mission was destined to have a terrible outcome
[01:17:21] whatever the reason I chose to write down exactly what I felt at that moment because I wanted my
[01:17:26] family to hear from me one last time if the worst happened I folded the note placed it in a ziplock bag
[01:17:34] so it wouldn't get damaged if it got wet and stuck it to my right arm
[01:17:38] front uniform pocket where God willing someone would find it and pass the letter along to my family
[01:17:49] did you have the proverbial bad feeling about this up so looking back now and I remember
[01:17:57] sitting there and I got to think and everyone up and down the valley knew we were coming
[01:18:06] and the first set of villages were deserted and so you know as you will see for bad time
[01:18:15] I don't I to this day I don't know why I decided to write that note again it could just be
[01:18:20] too many warm movies I have no idea but did you save it? I do I got it at home
[01:18:27] but yeah it just seems didn't you think you were jinxing yourself so I do worry about that a little bit
[01:18:34] but because I never wrote I would get that but like no I'm not writing that nothing's going to happen
[01:18:38] yeah good I just had this I don't know I just had this weird feeling plus you know being up in the front
[01:18:45] it's kind of like oh man and I don't know I just think I just think you know getting caught up in
[01:18:52] all the emotion of everything and you're amped up you're ready to go you're ready for the green light
[01:18:58] and everything like that and it's like all right let me let me bust this out man because I just
[01:19:01] really don't know so yeah it was very uncertain what we were walking into yeah the freaking ied
[01:19:10] these are crazy you know you're going into an ied thick area you know you're the first guy
[01:19:17] and even if you're not getting an ied you're the person that's walking into an ambush oh yeah
[01:19:22] you're gonna get shot in the face good times so finally you get the call from Ben let's move out guys
[01:19:31] we slowly charged our way toward the village of sar-tutu in the distance sar-tutu is made up
[01:19:38] of several mud-hut compounds in my group was tasked with clearing one of the sections keeping
[01:19:43] strict noise and like discipline we scan the hillside and the riverbank for any movement I kept my
[01:19:48] thumb on my weapon safety selector reddish switch to engage to kill the enemy
[01:19:53] taking fire from the Taliban was a risk we all knew as possible but the more likely scenario was
[01:19:58] experiencing a catastrophic ied explosion resulting in the loss of limbs and broken bodies
[01:20:05] all the team members were fully aware that one wrong step could change their lives forever
[01:20:10] my job was to make sure that did not happen these insidious bombs could be hidden anywhere
[01:20:15] buried in the ground hung in trees stashed in cooking pots inside the carcasses of that animals
[01:20:19] within car trunks are under clothing with the infamous strap-on suicide vests
[01:20:24] while they might have been built with fertilizer and discarded spare parts and look like a junior
[01:20:30] high school shop class project i never underestimated the lethality of these homemade bombs
[01:20:35] all i took was a handful all it took was a handful of high explosives a few inches of copper wire
[01:20:40] in a battery that nation could be triggered by compression the weight of a soldier or vehicle passing
[01:20:46] over the explosive charge remote control with cell phones or an electrical circuit from a distance
[01:20:51] the Taliban were limited only by their imagination which was limitless when it came to killing
[01:20:56] Americans moving up we intercepted a radio transmission from the Taliban indicating that they knew
[01:21:03] we were on the move and could see us at first the news made my heart race my palms got sweaty as my
[01:21:10] arm as my eyes darted around looking for anything slightly abnormal i felt i was starting to see
[01:21:16] things that really weren't there were my eyes playing tricks on me or my ears it seemed like i was
[01:21:21] curing all sorts of things when we stopped to get our bearings the guys called this hypervintulence
[01:21:26] hypervigilance and told me that when danger was imminent your senses rose up several notches to
[01:21:31] high alert status fueling the high percent activity was an overwhelming desire to stay alive
[01:21:38] the village was deserted when we entered one thing every sf guy knew was that when you entered a
[01:21:44] village and it deserted you better figure that you're in for a big fight or a village full of iedis
[01:21:49] in our minds iedis were a cowards way of fighting but no one could deny that they were extremely effective
[01:21:56] we had to clear each compound or homes we advanced slowly and deliberately looking for anything
[01:22:00] suspicious or out of the ordinary that could conceal an ied we were professional soldiers details matter
[01:22:07] a slight delay discoloration of the dirt a suspicious pile of rocks and abandoned water pale
[01:22:13] a tree that had been tagged with a marker a disturbance in a mud wall or alone person walking
[01:22:18] quickly directly toward us anything mattered but we didn't see any people or anything questionable
[01:22:26] even though i assumed every doorway and window had a pair of eyes looking at me and my buddies
[01:22:31] after we hit our first planned stopping point the team broke up in a smaller elements to cover
[01:22:37] a bigger area in and around the village including a world war one like trench that ran adjacent
[01:22:42] to the helmet river one of the taliban's favorite positions to fight us from each element was
[01:22:48] made up of two or three green berets and a handful of afghan fighters assisting us
[01:22:52] in clearing the village my element consisted of myself our team sergeant lance and six afghans
[01:22:58] one of whom was neck our interpreter neck wasn't the man's real name but everybody who supported
[01:23:04] our team was giving given an easy to remember nickname for the ease of communication
[01:23:08] our job alongside the afghans was to clear the first set of compounds running parallel
[01:23:14] to the river once the compounds were clear we would move on to the next set as i approach within
[01:23:19] 15 meters the first compound i watched for everything and anything from movement in the compounds
[01:23:24] of variations in the terrain where i was stepping i stopped and turned around to check on lance
[01:23:30] who is behind me with several afghans he gave me a nod meaning i could keep moving with the afghans
[01:23:35] and check out the first compound i motion to nick to come closer tell your guys to move up
[01:23:42] and clear the compound i said keep your fucking eyes open we both knew what that meant sweep the
[01:23:47] car your courtyard while watching every nook and cranny for a rifle barrel waiting to open fire
[01:23:53] nick turned and relayed my direction to the handful of afghans soldiers instead of moving
[01:23:57] they stood there like statues as precious seconds passed by it became clear to me that they were
[01:24:04] not going to move what the fuck i thought do they not understand what i need them to do
[01:24:08] are they too scared to go i whispered a nick what's the problem it's too dangerous nick replied
[01:24:14] no shit of course this was dangerous this was what war was all about i knew they were scared
[01:24:21] i was too i figured they wanted the americans to go first because they felt we had better weapons
[01:24:26] and knew we were a better fighters i kept my cool and refrain from losing my temper but i was
[01:24:31] pissed this is your damn country so fight for it i turned around to have a war with lance
[01:24:37] went out of the corner my eye i saw nick moving toward the front of the compound about 15 meters
[01:24:42] from me where a wooden door into our first mud hut was slightly a jar what's he doing why is he
[01:24:48] walking into an unclear part of the compound without afghans soldiers leading the way
[01:24:53] he was my damn interpreter not a fighter i knew better than to yell out to stop him since that
[01:24:58] could have invited a firefight even though the Taliban were on the move tactically it was best to
[01:25:03] assume the enemy did not know where we were and to remain relatively undetected for as long
[01:25:09] as possible in case Taliban fighters were inside the compound and waiting to spring a nasty surprise
[01:25:16] lance grabbed me by the arm get nick away from that door this wasn't the place or time for an
[01:25:22] afghan rambo even though 15 meters wasn't a lot of ground to cover each step was a gamble
[01:25:28] in Taliban controlled area i carefully but quickly moved up to neck and grabbed his arm
[01:25:34] nick don't move bro we need to move back to lance's position in regroup this is unclear to ground
[01:25:40] nick looked at me we're going to back away slowly i continued i want you to place your feet
[01:25:46] over my boat boot prints and slowly move with me back to lance if you stay in my steps you'll be okay
[01:25:55] nick did not want to retreat we can still get our guys inside the compound he said no the time is
[01:26:01] not right i reiterated we need to get reorganized the firmness in my voice told nick that i met
[01:26:08] business he started to move back from the compound and retreated slowly as well and i retreated
[01:26:13] slowly as well making sure i had my m4 ready to rock in case someone in the compound moved around
[01:26:19] the corner and open fire on us my eyes were sweeping the compound as well as looking where i placed my
[01:26:26] feet i took one slow step after another when boom a deafening explosion pounded my
[01:26:48] ear drums at the same instant a hot searing brighter than midday flash of light enveloped me the
[01:26:56] blast shattered the silence across the valley sending birds into the sky as they flap their wings
[01:27:00] and screeched the concussive explosion knocked me the ground like a blind side hit from a line black
[01:27:06] blind backer in an instant i landed on my back just outside the compound entrance the foul ammonia
[01:27:12] smelling air clogged my lungs and choked my breathing i instinctively rub the grip from my eyes
[01:27:19] and waited for the dust to settle trying as hard as i could to breathe but i could only manage
[01:27:25] the barest of breaths i fought for air as i fought for air a yellow brown cloud swirled around me
[01:27:33] i couldn't see my hands in front of my face because of all the dust in the air i shook my head
[01:27:38] and yon the couple times trying to squelts the high pitch ringing my ears but that didn't work
[01:27:42] then i opened my mouth the scream for nick wanting to make sure he was okay but nothing came out
[01:27:47] the thickness of the dust with the overwhelming smell of ammonia saturated the air
[01:27:52] and made it impossible to yell or to take a full gop of air i'm not sure what just happened but
[01:28:00] if i don't confess here i will suffocate in those first few disorienting moments i didn't
[01:28:06] feel any pain so i had to be okay i tried to stand but then i fell back over and heep damn i tried
[01:28:11] again but i couldn't stand up what the fuck what's happening to me i was having trouble thinking
[01:28:16] clearly then in a moment then a moment or two later i suddenly realized what had happened i had
[01:28:21] stepped on an iED damn when you are going through that compound to grab nick there was still
[01:28:37] this was still there had been no compromise yet like it was just silence yeah there was no compromise
[01:28:43] there was the the quietest i think i'll ever remember any environment being was that's the scene just
[01:28:52] incredibly creepy and quiet and you're trying to step in the boot prints that you made when you
[01:29:02] get when you went to get nick so you walk in backwards so kind of sort of you know all of us know
[01:29:10] that you never turn your back or your side to the unknown and so pass the breach point is the unknown
[01:29:16] so we have the breach or the doorway or whatever you want to call it and so what it what it happened
[01:29:25] was i was trying to move back but then you know how when you're the very last man in a
[01:29:29] patrol you're constantly doing the or what's sorry you're constantly doing the back look
[01:29:33] yeah well that's kind of what i was doing making sure that my info was ready to start putting
[01:29:39] rounds into the compound and yeah so and it's and it's still like the sun wasn't up yet the the
[01:29:48] sky was getting light but the sun wasn't quiet up yet so you know yeah it's just the perfect
[01:29:55] perfect storm it's like that time where you're not sure if you're better off with nodger
[01:29:59] an off nods like that moment of the morning yep yep within about 10 minutes you're taking your
[01:30:05] nods off and storm them yeah it was that that perfect moment of zero visit back to the book i
[01:30:15] so maybe came aware of the pain it was solely creeping in like a snake squeezing his victim to
[01:30:21] death i reached down from my left leg and wiggled it leg was still there bloody but still there
[01:30:25] when i tried to move my right leg however the pain was unbearable waving the sand and dust away
[01:30:29] with my hands to get a better view i could see my right combat boot was bent at a weird 90 degree angle
[01:30:35] it was like my combat boot made a T at the end of my leg the didn't seem possible that my leather
[01:30:41] boot could be twisted like that so i grabbed my right leg behind my right knee and lifted to get
[01:30:46] a better look as i raised my right leg up a tad my right foot flopped off to the side of my leg
[01:30:54] oh shit the only thing connecting my foot to my leg was stringy bloody red muscle tissue and
[01:30:59] ragged skin what was more disturbing was seeing the stark white bones poking out of my leg i was
[01:31:05] amazed at how glistening white they were in contrast with my bloody leg oh god this was bad i'm hit i'm hit
[01:31:20] so what's crazy about these situations is when there's an in your knee these i.e.
[01:31:28] the environments no one can move like you can't just go oh my buddy's hurt i'm going to go help
[01:31:35] that's the wrong move you have to you have to actually freeze and not move yep
[01:31:42] where there's one there's five yeah and and you find out later that this was a little bit of a
[01:31:50] well not a full low order detonation but there was probably 20 pounds and only seven or
[01:31:57] only only like a third of the the the i.e. went off yep otherwise you wouldn't be here right now no there
[01:32:03] would be they they they could have put what was left in me in a plastic bag if the whole thing would
[01:32:08] went off
[01:32:15] these guys they do and again you know you do a great job describing the stuff in the book
[01:32:21] i mean there's one part where you say i hear the team sergeant lansiel don't move Ryan
[01:32:26] and you help back where the fuck do you think i'm going as you're sitting there wounded yeah
[01:32:36] second stretched by like hours i'd never been in so much pain or felt so alone it was like i was
[01:32:41] the only person in that village i lay on my side and the dirt waiting for the bright light
[01:32:44] everyone says you see before you die lans is the closest american to me but i knew he couldn't
[01:32:49] rush to me because i had walked into an i.e. beef filled area chances were that he would be next and
[01:32:54] then what and in that moment it was impossible it was impossible to think clearly this is it
[01:33:01] i'm going to die in this shit whole village in afghanistan
[01:33:09] as i lay there for what seemed like hours i prayed harder than i had in years this was serious i
[01:33:13] felt like i was in the cost of eternity i'd always heard there were no atheists and foxholes
[01:33:18] and i guess they were right i was a Christian who had accepted Jesus Christ into my heart years
[01:33:22] ago but i'd strayed from the path of righteousness since then to say the least none the last i made
[01:33:28] peace with god and figured he understood the mistakes i had made in my life came back to me but
[01:33:33] so did the things i'd done right i asked for forgiveness for my sins and for the people i had heard
[01:33:39] in the state of mind i was in i felt this could be my last chance to make things right
[01:33:44] suddenly i felt a calm comb over me that i couldn't explain explain the pain lesson as i felt
[01:33:50] like i was fading into a deep sleep i thought of some of the good times i had had in my life
[01:33:54] for the July barbecue was loved ones watching the fireworks without a care in the world traveling
[01:33:59] around the world and all the amazing experience that brought me but most of all i was thinking about
[01:34:03] my family and how much at that moment i missed them i hope i've made my family proud but i also
[01:34:08] felt a strong sense of nagging guilt for letting my team down no green brahe wants that to happen but
[01:34:14] it did i fought back tears because i felt like i had failed my team five minutes or so after stepping
[01:34:20] on the i.e. i knew i was hanging on for dear life i could feel my life myself slipping away
[01:34:26] i'd heard so many say that your life flashes before your eyes just before you go but that wasn't
[01:34:31] happening i didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing stay awake lansiel don't pass
[01:34:36] out Ryan we're moving and you i skipped over this part but you had been trying to get a turn
[01:34:41] to get on yourself and you like couldn't get it done no i yeah i couldn't get it done because i
[01:34:45] um so i i pulled one of the rookie mistakes where usually on your kit you rubber band the
[01:34:52] turn a kid on correct well as you know it if that's security i'm gonna double secure it i'm
[01:34:58] gonna use the tip ties oh yeah so oops oops
[01:35:05] uh uh fast forward a little bit i felt a slap sharp i felt a sharp slap across my face and
[01:35:16] another and another each one harder than the last what the fuck i opened my eyes my
[01:35:20] found myself lying still in the dirt of the this pissant village my teammate George
[01:35:26] screamed stay awake Ryan keep your eyes open so he's just for his slap and you trying to
[01:35:32] so you are just all just blood loss um blood loss but i think more of it was shock and i don't
[01:35:39] i don't really understand how shock works but i i know it could kill you and so um there was some
[01:35:47] blood loss there but it was you know everything that had built up to you know George
[01:35:55] slap in the crap out of me um that was i i think i dealt with a lot of shock what was going on
[01:36:01] because i mean it's you know stepped on an ID yeah and then through they give you some morphine
[01:36:08] and you get hive so it turns out you're allergic to morphine yeah it's not a good to have to find out
[01:36:17] eventually and again you gotta read the book but eventually Kyle who must be a horse
[01:36:23] lifts Kyle couldn't move fast enough because he lifts you up he's buddy carrying you Kyle
[01:36:26] couldn't move fast enough because his body arm and gear along with 200 pound man over shoulder
[01:36:31] LZ was long ways away more than 500 meters the team took turns carrying me while keeping
[01:36:36] security high the Taliban knew i was hit because our afghan interpreted her monitoring
[01:36:40] their radio traffic could hear them celebrating and laughing about hitting me
[01:36:44] so they get you to the LZ um they get you extracted and then the next thing you know you're
[01:36:59] showing up in in uh tearing cot and then in the hospital you get pissed because they're
[01:37:05] gonna caught off your shirt which is one of your favorite lucky shirt my lucky organ ducks football
[01:37:10] share it yeah but they end up cut it off um and again you know you do you give you a great job
[01:37:19] talking about the medical team and the doctors, the nurses and the staff that freaking takes care of you
[01:37:24] and and keeps you alive, skit you stabilized and then from there you go to k af more surgeries
[01:37:36] they're trying to clean you know trying to clean it out and and then it's over to germany
[01:37:42] you end up in ramstine um and then at long stool i mean then again i'm just jumping through a bunch
[01:37:50] of stuff that you got to read the book because you know it's it's all it's all part of the story
[01:37:56] what you're going through i mean yeah i'll pull one little quote you say so i'm out of patrol
[01:38:04] trying to find i.e. my damn metal detector wasn't working so i closed my eyes and stomped around
[01:38:08] to clear the root boom found one mission success you say here i've been to germany many times
[01:38:19] during my military career but this time it felt different because i was fresh off the battlefield
[01:38:22] to Afghanistan i finally felt safe from the aircraft landed no longer a dangerous part of the world
[01:38:27] i could finally relax or so i thought what i didn't know is it now i'd have plenty of time to
[01:38:33] actually think about everything that had happened to me i would also have time to cry over
[01:38:38] my friends who didn't make it home alive the ones placed into coffins for the one way flight to
[01:38:42] dover air force base in Delaware a grim trip the no one wants to take out of time to think about
[01:38:48] the families torn apart because of war either because they lost a loved one or their soldier was
[01:38:52] coming home with a mangled body never to be the same again that was my situation as well i knew
[01:38:58] i was never going to be the same again all right um again jumping ahead here where you end up
[01:39:10] at broke army medical center bm it bmc for exam use in Texas fast forward after i woke up
[01:39:20] from my 15th surgery and unexpected visor stepped in my room where i was resting my father
[01:39:29] somewhere between me getting blown up and getting to germany my dad was notified about my injuries
[01:39:33] seeing my father standing next to my hospital bed in a sweat cake cowboy hat
[01:39:37] person is head and cowshit likely still on his boots gave me a much-needed sense of normality and
[01:39:42] safety this was a major surprise that it's good to see you my father gave my leg a long look
[01:39:48] then he gave me the usual tough but correct opinion well i figured if you played with fire long enough
[01:39:53] you're going to get burnt looks like you stepped on a doozy glad your lives son from his demeanor
[01:39:59] one would think i'd suffered a little more than scratch for the first month of my time at
[01:40:07] bmc my father never left my hospital room on the seventh floor it was like you felt the need to be
[01:40:11] there for me observing protecting and taking everything in my old sister Chris who is my half
[01:40:17] sister from my dad's first marriage was also there and you talk about the just the doctors and
[01:40:25] the nurses and the health care providers that are there and what they're seeing every single freaking
[01:40:31] day how hard that is on them you get your your lead doctor a guy named doctor sue
[01:40:40] and he comes in and you're talking to him the status of my right foot and leg was still uncertain
[01:40:49] i would lose the rest of my low would i lose the rest of my lower leg or was it worth trying to keep
[01:40:54] the damn thing doctor sue never sugarcoded anything even though at times i wish you would
[01:41:00] i'll never forget one conversation we have we have enough tissue to do a limb at salvage surgery
[01:41:06] he said well do our best to reattach your foot and lower leg but there are no guarantees because
[01:41:12] your leg is in bad shape we're giving it a 10 to 15 percent chance for success and if that doesn't
[01:41:19] work i asked we'll have to amputate but look on the bright side if this works we will rewrite
[01:41:25] limb salvage medical history well that was a ray of hope so do you think we should go ahead
[01:41:30] yes i do but this would be a long painful road it could be worth it in the end so what do you think
[01:41:37] i thought for a moment this was a big decision well i still have my leg i still have options
[01:41:43] but at the moment but the moment i have to cut it off there's no going back i reasoned
[01:41:47] you've been telling me that this will be the hardest thing i've ever done but if successful
[01:41:51] doctors will use my case to redefine limb salvage hell yeah i love a challenge let's do it
[01:42:02] like pain a picture for me what's connecting your right lower leg to your rest of your body
[01:42:12] so at that point in the hospital i had um this it it was called a um x fix it it looks like this
[01:42:20] giant bird cage and there's like 20 summod rods that they screw into your bone so my so
[01:42:29] you know obviously you need your you need your tip your tubula but the fib they weren't really
[01:42:35] worried about it and they said add the fib doesn't really do much for you so we're just going
[01:42:39] to let that free flow okay fine but the tip so basically what they did was they lined up
[01:42:45] the tubula the best that they could through the surgeries screwed all of the rods into my
[01:42:50] bones you know upper and lower and i had i had rods going into my toes i it looked like something
[01:42:57] of a saw movie but and then yeah they just they they they secure everything together with just
[01:43:06] all these rods going into your leg and then the halo devices that attached to the rods and then
[01:43:12] yeah the only way you can really grow bone is through friction and just beaten the crap out of
[01:43:18] yourself and physical therapy and whatnot so you know i had about two two inches of a tubula
[01:43:26] to grow back and so i was yeah as well i did do some uh yeah some beat down sessions you know
[01:43:33] in physical therapy to get that bone grown so when when at like when it happened you describe
[01:43:40] there's just like basically a piece of meat keeping your leg how about nerves to the nerves get
[01:43:45] damaged yeah so even even right now i have um i probably have half um nerve function in my leg
[01:43:53] and then there's you know parts of my leg that i just don't feel at all and then there's other
[01:43:58] parts that are um hypersensitive and then and it's it's crazy but but yeah my right leg is
[01:44:07] a skin graph the bottom of my foot is skin graph it's it's it's pretty uh it's pretty it was it was
[01:44:15] pretty intense but medical technology and the graph the skin on your bottom of your foot uh so
[01:44:23] i have this during from i have this dream that i want to be able to kick somebody in the face
[01:44:29] because it's from my ass okay and then i could yeah this is that does that because i'm thinking
[01:44:36] is the skin that's on the bottom of your foot is that like does it does it develop calisers
[01:44:43] everything now like it no it's it's it'll never go past the newborn stage damn yeah so there's
[01:44:52] yeah when i damage it it's it's bad so this so this whole procedure was uh was like a freaking
[01:45:00] bottom of the ninth like just last ditch effort hail Mary i guess we'll go football we'll go hail
[01:45:07] Mary scenario yeah um well to save my leg it was but for the surgeons because i you know i remember
[01:45:14] Dr. She's saying i mean fly out he's like if it doesn't work it's not like you had a leg anyway so
[01:45:21] you know just move on so um for them it was an act it was an excellent opportunity to
[01:45:27] to advance um you know technology with lymph salvage and one i like that and um and yeah it's
[01:45:34] uh 2010 was an excellent year to do it because there's a lot of dudes getting blown up lots of dudes
[01:45:42] man that's um that's crazy uh this is cool your your command sergeant major who you call Brian
[01:45:50] Brian was a man of his word someone who put his men before himself he understood those under his
[01:45:55] command took personal time to do what he could to ensure each and every man was taken care of
[01:45:59] he was a tough leader who had crushed you if you were wrong but he would go to hell and back
[01:46:04] to defend any of his men and you go into the book here one thing among green berets is the
[01:46:11] willingness to do anything to get back in the fight i was no different toward the end of his visit
[01:46:16] i asked Brian the one question that had been haunting haunting me for weeks i don't know what my
[01:46:21] future holds but i will not let this injury beat me i fully intend on being a green beret
[01:46:26] and deploying again if i can get myself healthy will you send me back into the fight
[01:46:32] Brian looked at me like i had two heads then glanced down on my right leg he knew that he knew what
[01:46:37] was in the heart of every green beret but he had to drop some common sense on me you're lucky to be
[01:46:42] alive Ryan let's figure out how to get you walking again you've got a long road ahead of you
[01:46:48] relax and take it easy that wasn't exactly the response i was hoping for but hell i knew i'd be
[01:46:53] lucky to walk on assisted one day so maybe the chance of returning to active duty as a green beret
[01:46:58] were a little far fetched all it took was one look at my blown up leg and everyone knew this
[01:47:04] was something that just wasn't going to happen but i wasn't giving up Brian had my back but when i
[01:47:10] asked anyone in the hospital the same question i heard something like this it's cool the way you feel
[01:47:15] Ryan but you would be limping and impaying for the rest of your life leave the fighting to the
[01:47:19] young healthy guys you've proven yourself enough but before you left my sergeant major surprised me
[01:47:26] Brian leaned in look me in the eye and made me a promise Ryan if you can get medically cleared
[01:47:32] i will send you back to afghanistan
[01:47:37] yep check
[01:47:42] that's awesome i don't think he quite realized you know what was uh i i talked to and we still keep
[01:47:49] in touch now and it's you know it's hey man did you do you guys think i was going to you know come back
[01:47:55] is man it's i mean no yeah i can't imagine here it's just trying to sit you know okay yeah
[01:48:04] hey cool yeah i know you want to come back if you can get healthy you come back but really he's
[01:48:07] thinking i hope this guy walks again yeah it was and and not you know because i they did medically
[01:48:13] retire me and i had to you know fight back on the active duty um so but yeah it was uh it was
[01:48:21] one of those situations and i remember um i remember i had uh i forgot who he was either you
[01:48:27] they're not i don't know but um one of the doctors he said hey look man it's it's good to have goals
[01:48:34] it is but your goals aren't realistic you're setting yourself up for failure because you're not
[01:48:40] going back like this is the doctor told you this not doctor shoe but one of the other doctors yes
[01:48:46] another doctor that was a part of my um therapy whatnot and he and i understood where he was
[01:48:52] coming from it's expectation management you know um and he said i my biggest concern is that you
[01:48:59] set these goals up for yourself and when they don't happen you can't recover from you know not
[01:49:06] achieving your goals mmm especially as a wounded guy because we we all do it's you know i i
[01:49:13] don't think there's a single military member in the united states um armed forces that got wounded
[01:49:20] and didn't want to get back in the flight as quick as they could i mean they're probably is i don't know
[01:49:24] i don't think so yeah i've never heard of one so but yeah you just expectation management you
[01:49:31] got to understand like you can want it and it's a good drive but man it's you're you know you're in
[01:49:40] the bottom of your your in the bottom of the ninth just like you said so it's like you need to
[01:49:45] you need you need to do some management expectation here because like start thinking about other things
[01:49:50] start you know what are you gonna do with your life out of the military and stuff like that
[01:49:54] and i understood where he was going with it because um unfortunately a very bad statistic even you know
[01:50:01] 2009 and 10 11 12 was um wounded dudes dying you know um commintan suicide whatnot and and so they
[01:50:08] had to manage expectations with you guys because yeah so i understood it um the other thing that you
[01:50:16] write about in here is the like you're on all these different drugs obviously for painkillers and stuff
[01:50:21] but it seems like that's just kind of sent you in like real super emotional you'd be like laughing
[01:50:27] then you'd be crying and sound like that was just freaking crazy yeah yeah the the drugs i was
[01:50:33] on i mean methadone for one oh my gosh it's i don't quite know what it would be like to be a
[01:50:39] zombie but i'm pretty sure i got a good idea from that drug yeah methadone is a hell of a drug so
[01:50:46] and that's what they used to get people off of heroin and you're just you they had you on it for
[01:50:50] pain obviously yep so crazy uh there's another got another got another quote in here from the
[01:51:01] old man maybe my left get the old man on the podcast says uh you know because you are you kind of
[01:51:07] like rock bottom you're all freaking emotional about everything and he says looks on you got Delta
[01:51:13] bad hand but this is a speed bump in life that's all how you handle this situation and pick
[01:51:18] yourself up will determine how this affects you later as bad as it seems right now as dark as
[01:51:24] the times appear to be never forget that with time you will heal and look back on this please don't
[01:51:31] allow yourself to look back and feel ashamed about how you dealt with this take control of your
[01:51:37] life own this situation turn it into something good learn about yourself in a positive way and I promise
[01:51:45] you in the end you will be a better man dad's pep talk man to pep talk meant the world to me i
[01:51:56] lay in my hospital bed that night and vowed i would never become a victim of life's circumstances
[01:52:01] i would use this situation to make myself even stronger i would face my demons which i had held
[01:52:06] close for many years and defeat them for years i had used my difficult childhood as a crutch after
[01:52:12] my father and mother divorced dad had married two more times and always seemed to find the bad ones
[01:52:17] i did not trust women or really anyone for that matter which i blamed on my past before i became a
[01:52:23] green beret i'd two failed marriages and it left the path of destruction behind me but i always found
[01:52:29] ways to rationalize my behavior it was never my fault i'm this way because i grew up poor i'm
[01:52:35] this way because i had a shitty childhood i'm this way because life's not fair everything was always
[01:52:41] someone or something else's fault i did not have control over my life life controlled me even
[01:52:50] though my dad had raised me right there were some things you just had to learn on your own the
[01:52:55] hard way the saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger seemed like the story of my life
[01:53:02] but it didn't just happen on my own i had to make the choice to become stronger that's when i
[01:53:09] determined i would use this near death experience to make myself a better man this will not beat
[01:53:15] me i will be the man i was raised to be i will take control of my life and finally be responsible for my
[01:53:20] actions even with this my come to Jesus moment i knew life wasn't going to get any easier as a matter
[01:53:28] fact the hard work was just beginning i can take some ownership what's going on you're dad told
[01:53:40] you to own it yeah i actually a lot of people don't understand this when i say when i say this
[01:53:47] but um stepping on that iED actually saved my life yeah and expand so the path that i was heading
[01:53:56] down i was i was going to a point to where i couldn't return from um just life controlled me
[01:54:04] a victim of everything i was just running you know i would destroy people around me instead of building
[01:54:10] them up i was not a good person um even with the victory of becoming a green beret i still hadn't
[01:54:17] i i still hadn't faced any of my issues i was just i was constantly running for issues and um
[01:54:24] and there was always i mean there was always something i was just i was weak it was easy to
[01:54:32] to blame somebody or something or use the excuse of i mean you name it and i came up with it
[01:54:39] instead of taking i mean i'll use it um you trade market but instead of taking extreme ownership of your
[01:54:47] life i um you know i i allowed life to to own me and it did and it did and it wasn't until i
[01:54:56] stepped on that iED that i was actually able to get control of my life again what are the biggest
[01:55:02] things you thought what was what was like the core issue that you were running from what like was
[01:55:08] pent up in you that made you that you think like steered you in these directions where you would
[01:55:13] be being a tear people down like what do you think made you so kind of destructive i hated myself
[01:55:20] i wasn't happy um i didn't know how to like myself i didn't i you know i always tried to live this
[01:55:28] other people's lives thing and you know i mean you see it today it's it's rampant where people
[01:55:34] they try and be something that they're not they they don't have their own identity and i had no
[01:55:39] identity because what i was as a person was was ugly and destructive and i didn't like myself at all
[01:55:47] and so i technically i was always running from myself in the easiest way to do it is to take a good
[01:55:54] situation turn it into shit blame everybody else for tear people down around you and then move on to the next
[01:56:01] lately i've been thinking about this um it's real easy when when you got an opportunity when there's
[01:56:08] an opportunity for you to do something and you either fail or you're scared to try one of the easiest
[01:56:17] things to do is say well that's not cool or that's not the important or that's not for me so
[01:56:25] it happens on every level right it happens on every level when you know oh you're not great
[01:56:29] you're not a great runner well running we we see here's a classic example in the seal teams
[01:56:34] uh running right to just running let go go on for run and people that weren't good at running
[01:56:42] would be like running breeds cowardice meaning yeah you know we're never going to run and it's
[01:56:47] it's funny thing you know but that's like a little bit of an example of what we do as people
[01:56:53] of saying oh well uh school doesn't matter right when i was a kid right school doesn't
[01:56:59] school student that was me all day long when i was going to high school school doesn't matter
[01:57:03] why because i didn't want to try you know i didn't want to put forth the effort it's like oh so
[01:57:07] therefore it doesn't matter and it's something that we do all the time and people do it with um
[01:57:15] you know like hard work like starting a business uh and i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not
[01:57:20] i'm not i'm not i'm not all into all that material stuff when really they just don't want to work hard
[01:57:24] yeah this are they cut it down and they actually will detract from people that are working hard
[01:57:29] there's and you could say this about really about anything right and it seems like that's sort of
[01:57:36] that's sort of it's not exactly what you're saying but it's something that i've been thinking about lately
[01:57:41] as i look at my life and i'm like oh you know oh yeah that doesn't really matter i'm like oh wait a
[01:57:44] second does that really not matter or am i just am i just throwing that thing out because it's
[01:57:50] something that i don't want to do or i'm afraid of or i'm calling it not important because oh
[01:57:56] really okay well let's take a look at that let's take a look at that you look puzzled no no that's
[01:58:02] it's that's interesting there that because that's like a level deeper than like what's happening
[01:58:07] that's like kind of like okay so you know what sour grapes right you heard that before sour
[01:58:11] yeah yeah that expression so it's kind of the same way expand on sour grapes so i know
[01:58:15] your definition okay so sour grapes is like it's almost like jealousy almost but
[01:58:23] so this is where the expression came from found out where there was this fox and he saw some
[01:58:28] grapes hanging on a vine kind of high up and he's like oh i'm gonna jump up and eat those grapes
[01:58:33] so he jumps up and he can't jump high enough so he's like all right whatever all he any try is
[01:58:39] again still can't jump high enough he tries one more time he's like oh no i'm gonna get on this time
[01:58:44] is there they look delicious up there he jumps up he can't get him and he's like that's grapes
[01:58:49] probably sour anyway you know that's it and leaves so it's kind of that right definitely kind of
[01:58:56] yeah definitely kind of that I don't want it you don't like that yeah that's not important yeah
[01:59:02] sour and if you let that if you if you if you continually do that if you continually to kind of
[01:59:10] shun and turn your back on everything that is a challenge you know like you could have done this like
[01:59:16] you know being in this freaking special operations you know after you after you didn't make it through
[01:59:21] buds you'd be like yeah being in special being the military stupid right you could have done that you
[01:59:26] could have done that all day long being the military stupid those guys are freaking idiots
[01:59:29] I don't want to be like you could have you could have gone into that mode and you just turn your back
[01:59:33] and then you turn your back on something else and you and pretty soon you look around and there's
[01:59:37] you're just you have nothing left right there's no that you've turned your back on everything
[01:59:41] yep it becomes a lifestyle and that's that's when it's dangerous and we've all we've all seen
[01:59:47] people today that they have shunned away from anything that is that that they could possibly
[01:59:56] fail at because of the fear of failure that they I mean they they've made that their life they
[02:00:03] are that person now and that's that's hard to come back from you know what I really like about
[02:00:09] what you just said I really like the fact that you just because you know everyone talks about
[02:00:13] lifestyle in like a positive thing like let's a Gigi to lifestyle it's a healthy lifestyle
[02:00:18] it's a what and you're like oh there's another lifestyle it's called denial and making excuses
[02:00:24] that's a lifestyle too and it's a shitty one that means a bad place is that's interesting
[02:00:30] the deterring other people down thing where you know how you say it out loud and it's like
[02:00:34] why would anyone do that like it's so obvious not to do that but I think when you're in it
[02:00:41] and you say you hated yourself right yeah we're even that's another one or it's like how can you
[02:00:45] hate yourself that doesn't even make sense right it's oh that's like expression but in a way it's
[02:00:52] like literally true where if you if you don't like yourself that makes you feel a certain way
[02:00:57] and it's it's bad it's a bad feeling we'll say it puts simply so what kind of relief can you get
[02:01:03] from that bad feeling is if you make other people seem less than and it kind of like relieves
[02:01:10] you of that feeling just a little bit you know but not fully not even close to fully so you
[02:01:14] constantly gotta do it to feel better about yourself essentially yep it is it's a series problem
[02:01:21] we we see it in our country all the time right now I think that's actually what made me start
[02:01:28] thinking about this because I'm talking about oh running is but you're what you're talking about
[02:01:34] the same thing when you look at another person and instead of going damn that person's really
[02:01:38] accomplished a lot that's awesome instead you say well I'm not gonna be some kind of career guy
[02:01:42] that's chasing a promotion or yeah they they just want to get all those calls so they could look
[02:01:47] good yeah you just throw all kinds of hate at them yeah but the person that you really hate
[02:01:52] those are those are the excuses I'm talking about is you make up your own demise you make up
[02:01:58] your own excuses as to why that is not your path into basically you demonize that person to
[02:02:07] make yourself feel better even though 90 that's great 100% of the time it's because it's because
[02:02:17] you're afraid to fail yeah and it's weird when you start looking at chunks of people that
[02:02:27] look into oh that lifestyles bad and it's like okay what do you really about about someone that's
[02:02:35] working hard and trying to be in good physical condition and trying to learn and trying to grow
[02:02:42] like there's people that look down on all those things which is kind of crazy when you think about it
[02:02:48] yeah yep all right hey tell us about the what do you call the ideal breed
[02:02:57] braids or is it ideal like do you how do you say that yeah it's it so I call it an ideal
[02:03:02] ideal okay but yeah basically it's Ryan Blanick he he created these things and it gives me a
[02:03:14] calf and you know push up you know I couldn't I got plant I think whatever one goes down I don't know
[02:03:20] but I yeah I'm sitting here trying to tell you all right it's like an exoskeleton type
[02:03:26] brace that you wear that makes up for whatever deficiencies you might have yes you're moving
[02:03:32] yes and so it gives you know that that basically it's it gives you your life back and that's what
[02:03:39] allows you to keep your leg that's what allows you to not have to go through the prosthetic
[02:03:45] is because now you have this I'm not even going to try and say the name but it's it's long
[02:03:52] the you mean the intrepid dynamic exoskeleton or phosis that that's what I was going to say
[02:03:58] I understand you do you have to wear that thing all the time so I've actually gotten to a
[02:04:04] point now to where I've rebuilt back my leg to where I only use that if I'm doing anything physical
[02:04:11] like gym I'll have my ideal on or deployment I'll wear the ideal whatnot but here I know I came here
[02:04:20] without it on I didn't you're walking around I mean you you walk in totally normal walking upstairs
[02:04:25] downstairs I mean it's awesome to see yeah and yeah until until you tell you cut on that one thing
[02:04:32] and it's that's funny and that's because you have no nerves or do you have like drop foot
[02:04:37] no I I don't have drop foot it's kind of naturally as fused itself at the the L okay yeah so
[02:04:47] but you know you can catch yourself and it's I think it's funny
[02:04:52] what is drop foot like it's like it's like it's like the nerve that makes you lift up your foot
[02:04:57] gets damaged and so your foot just kind of has done yeah yeah yeah yeah it did it naturally
[02:05:03] fused at the ankle joint so that nerve is gone but it's just the foot just stays at an
[02:05:09] out of no and Andy Stumpf has a certain amount of drop foot and from when he got shot you like
[02:05:17] lost some you got some you got a bunch of injuries but he got some nerve damage and so his foot
[02:05:21] doesn't respond really the way he wants it to and he makes him pretty funny jokes about that
[02:05:26] I can't imagine it's it's got a funny thing so the army wanted to medically retire you
[02:05:34] at this point and and then they offered you kind of something called continuation on active duty
[02:05:40] which means you basically they're still going to give you your paycheck and you're going to
[02:05:43] some kind of an admin job for you get to 20 yep yes so I was medically retired and then I applied
[02:05:49] for the waiver which was the continuation on active duty waiver and I got picked up for that how many
[02:05:55] years had you been in at this point total Air Force Navy and Army 12 yeah something like that
[02:06:04] so you now did you is that a document that you like signed you accept that or did you fight it
[02:06:11] the medical retirement well the medically retired medical retirement you you obviously fought
[02:06:16] yeah I mean that that was so I was medically retired and then I came back on to active duty
[02:06:22] through a waiver got it so they medically retired you and then you came back on when you
[02:06:27] came back on did you have that limited duty thing the the the continuation on active duties that
[02:06:32] how you came back on yeah and basically what it is so they do it for green braise seals
[02:06:38] raiders all kinds of stuff if they they spent that kind of money training you up we can find some
[02:06:44] review yeah absolutely no it's an awesome program and it's a good way to take care of take care of
[02:06:49] people yep then you find out about this program called four three yeah and so it's all about that
[02:06:57] Thor three program so I think I think this seals I think you guys kind of have some similar
[02:07:03] the return to fight program yeah we got all we got awesome people that are just doing everything
[02:07:08] they can to keep guys ready and if they get hurt to get them back in the fight yep it's awesome
[02:07:13] yep so it's basically that we call it the return to fight or the road to war program or whatever
[02:07:20] and it's hard I mean they bring these guys in from you know they were physical trainers for
[02:07:27] you know hockey teams or whatnot or like Paul he was he he was on Tito Ortiz's group and Paul
[02:07:35] did all of the athletic training for him so yeah you're not really going to tell him like it's kind of
[02:07:41] awesome it's like oh that's cute so and and I just I knew you know I I'd gotten myself back
[02:07:50] to seventh group but I had a dead man's profile so I knew for me for seventh group to wave
[02:07:58] big armies profile I would have to I would have to tear up dudes in the Thor three program
[02:08:04] and and so I just you know I I was on this path of you know I I was getting I was
[02:08:11] rocking up victories in my life and and so the Thor three program was it was tough it was extremely
[02:08:19] hard but guys that had never been hurt before I was just you know with all the physical events
[02:08:24] and everything like that just leave me in the middle dust but you know they weren't really
[02:08:27] fighting for anything I was I was trying to get back to war so um and then
[02:08:34] you you end up pulling it off man yeah yeah uh here you go after a few months of working with it
[02:08:40] with a Thor three program building up my body and rehabbing my store right leg and pressing my
[02:08:44] PT's on how far I'd come my command gave me some great news I was good to deploy
[02:08:51] when seventh group would take full responsibility for me my waiver was signed I was jacked
[02:08:56] from the moment I got the word from Brian that if I could get healthy enough huge semi back I had
[02:09:01] only one goal in my head to return to combat this was why I'd put in all the hard work I didn't
[02:09:06] want to be cooped up in some cubicle reading reports and looking at the clock counting down
[02:09:09] the hours until I would call today I want to be conducting missions with the guys doing what I
[02:09:14] was trained to do taking the flight to the enemy my company had already left for Afghanistan but once
[02:09:19] I got the medical waiver signed by seventh group lead surgeon I was on the next flight out April
[02:09:24] 2012 I would be deployed to the Pange Y is that right? uh Pange way district and can't
[02:09:32] to hard province in southern Afghanistan known as the birthplace of the Taliban times could have been
[02:09:37] tensor in the area so there you go man yeah yeah I got my wish return returned to war and then
[02:09:46] I got sent to the the most heavily IED area in Afghanistan in 2012 bro this is this is freaking
[02:09:54] all right so here we go you're you get sent to the most heavily IED place I was reading this
[02:10:03] I was like all right I'll just read it so here we go you're on you're on a really hard patrol
[02:10:10] to get to where you're going to get to the target area your the freaking point man again
[02:10:17] by the way the last time you were a point man you you got freaking blown up yeah
[02:10:22] you start you start clearing this compound again this is like deja vu back to the book we were
[02:10:29] barely underway when one of my afghan special forces soldiers and I detected our first IED
[02:10:34] and a partially collapsed outside wall of the first compound there it was buried in the dirt
[02:10:40] surrounded by rubble from a break in the wall that was likely caused by a previous IED blast
[02:10:45] or an RPG strike a nice little IED all you had to do is trip this sucker all you had to do to trip
[02:10:51] this sucker was step on the pressure plates that connected the positive wires to the negative
[02:10:55] once the circuit was completed boom the charge went off and your life was changed forever
[02:10:59] welcome back to afghanistan the Taliban had figured we would take this route because it was a
[02:11:04] short cut into the compound I have to admit that finding my first IED since nearly losing my life
[02:11:10] especially a nasty one like this produced a whole range of emotions my heart was racing
[02:11:16] but I had to keep it together because my team was watching really you have to admit that you had
[02:11:21] some some emotions first I slowly pushed the dirt away exposing the corners of the pressure
[02:11:29] plate I studied my hands and searched for the arming wires when I uncovered them I trace the
[02:11:34] wires to a battery pack hidden behind some rocks then I disconnected the power source and clamped
[02:11:39] surgical clamps to the wire my surgical clamps were attached to a 50 foot nylon cord so I could
[02:11:44] get some standoff or safe distance before pulling out the pressure plate after moving the team back I
[02:11:50] got my 50 feet of standoff and gave the cord a pull the pressure plate came flying through the air
[02:11:55] the first step was complete but the IED was not completely disarmed I then attached my cord to a
[02:12:01] plastic yellow jug buried beneath the pressure plate and returned my to my 50 foot withdrawal distance
[02:12:07] after a tug of war match with the jug I was finally able to yank it out of the ground crap
[02:12:12] this was a 15 pound IED more than enough to kill you or blow off both your legs
[02:12:18] how come I didn't just safely blow up the IED which is exactly what I was asking but normal
[02:12:22] procedure is when you find a freaking IED you put some explosives on your blow that thing up
[02:12:27] blow in place. Bip. Yep. Usually when I come across an idea I exposed part of the pressure plate
[02:12:33] to verify it was natural explosive then I would place a half block of C4 on it and blow it in place
[02:12:39] but we were trying to track down the IED makers in our area I decided to disarmed the IED instead
[02:12:43] of blowing it up because of the increased pressure we were getting to collect evidence which was
[02:12:48] key to finding the culprits with this first IED out of the way I breathed the deep sigh relief
[02:12:54] things had gone well and it almost felt like I knew what I was doing better yet I gave my teammates
[02:12:59] a warm fuzzy feeling about my capabilities and showed them that I could be an asset rather than
[02:13:04] a liability on the battlefield why did I deal with the IED instead of directing one of our
[02:13:10] afghan counter IEDs to get on it you could call me stupid or crazy but I wanted to get some
[02:13:16] IEDs under my belt okay I mean I you're not stupid so I guess we're going with crazy
[02:13:26] and I guess you want to get some IEDs under your belt has been to get an IEDs under your foot
[02:13:30] yeah I think I think my mindset at that time was very I mean could have been
[02:13:38] pretty deemed as pretty reckless but I just then that was the first one I came in contact with
[02:13:44] and I was going to own it yeah that's just kind of that's the choice I made if I was to go back I would
[02:13:50] stick half-blocksy for on and move back and that's what you're doing man IED after IED cash after
[02:13:57] cash every time we go out on a mission one thing was certain is the sun coming up in the
[02:14:01] morning we'd run into some sort of explosive device made to kill or maymust and you know I I
[02:14:07] skipped through the part where you kind of like we're checking back in with the team and these
[02:14:10] guys are thinking hey can this guy really do his job and he's already how scared is he going to be
[02:14:14] how bad is his leg he's out here with a freaking brace on his leg what kind of you know so you
[02:14:19] had to kind of push through all that it kind of skipped through but it's a really interesting part of
[02:14:22] the book as well yeah I mean and and that's the thing is I've I've heard people's reaction to it
[02:14:29] they're like oh well that's that's that's just so messed up and I was like it's not that's special
[02:14:33] operations when you go out to the team being in war isn't a make-a-wish foundation kind of thing
[02:14:40] like oh you know here's our make-a-wish foundation green beret we're gonna take them out on some missions
[02:14:44] no people people can die and and so I understood completely like they knew what had happened to me
[02:14:51] most of the team was on the battlefield that day in the helmet saw my leg and so for me to get back
[02:14:59] out to the team in the most heavily ied area in afghanistan at that point I don't blame like what are
[02:15:06] you doing here dude like you have no business being out here but you got to prove it
[02:15:12] another cool I'm not gonna read the whole section but you're talking about like what you're looking for
[02:15:17] and one thing you said is you you you'd you'd be looking and you'd be thinking what I put an
[02:15:22] ID there if I was a bad guy that was kind of the perception you looked at everything with oh yeah
[02:15:26] I get asked this question a lot about how do I find ied's and they're like oh yeah the mine detector
[02:15:32] my detector doesn't really do anything for me I look at so I I take a breakdown of the battlefield
[02:15:38] or the objective that we're going on to and then I look at okay so the easiest avenues of approach
[02:15:45] they're gonna be ied's there you got a 12 foot mud hut wall and there's a break in the wall right
[02:15:50] here and then it's 12 feet again there's gonna be an ied there and then I also so before I even
[02:15:56] use my mind detector I get ground sign ground sign tells me everything and then I verify it with
[02:16:03] my mind detector and then I mean I've I've definitely come up to like breaks in the wall and whatnot
[02:16:11] and I don't even use my mind detector or anything I just put a block a c4 there get back and
[02:16:15] whoa yeah because it's gonna be one there and so how much of how much do you think like a one
[02:16:23] thing I was always paranoid about it's like oh they got the fake ied there and did this in
[02:16:27] remodio a lot like oh there's a wire and whatever and someone goes over to disarm it and they step
[02:16:32] on something else to get blown up yep the decoys the decoys are nasty super nasty and that
[02:16:37] that goes back to that you know that saying that we've all had and I guarantee you guys probably
[02:16:43] said it in remodie was where there's one there's five you know you know where there's one there
[02:16:49] could be ten or what but where there's one there's gonna be secondary because when that guy hits
[02:16:54] one of them then the rescue teams gonna come in and they're gonna start hitting the secondarys or
[02:16:59] we're gonna use one as a decoy and then we're pretty sure we can funnel with this decoy here now I
[02:17:05] can funnel the troop movement this way and then it's all iedd yeah and my point in bringing that up
[02:17:11] is like it's it's it's it's it's not checkers it's not like oh there's an obvious place there's
[02:17:17] an ID it's chess where it's like oh there's one there but that means they're probably thinking
[02:17:20] we're gonna move over there so in the place we really need to watch out for it so the Taliban are
[02:17:25] super good at that crazy good at trying to anticipate troop movements and then iedd's you're
[02:17:33] carrying on with the deployment months go by and at one point you're in a little bit of a firefight
[02:17:40] and you you step into basically a shit ditch and it's filled with shit it's filled with human
[02:17:49] sewage which is which socks because it's staying since it's gross and all that but the real
[02:17:54] problem is you got your you know your foot which is a bunch of skin graphs is in there and this is
[02:18:02] after a long patrol so you already got blisters and whatnot because you got freaking baby
[02:18:07] skin on the bottom of your foot yeah open blisters so that is a problem yeah i mean we we got we
[02:18:18] got in a bit of a tick and every every war fighter knows cover and then return fire
[02:18:24] violence of action everything like that to you know get control the situation again
[02:18:30] and so i remember you know we're we're engaging you know different targets and i was you know
[02:18:35] my my adrenaline was really high but it still is man something really sick here it's like what in
[02:18:41] the heck is this and i just and then finally once you know it's like all right we got aircraft
[02:18:46] on station which means bad guys are gone so then i start to kind of get a sense of my surroundings
[02:18:53] and as a shit trench then i was up to my my calves and and so all of the open sores that i had
[02:19:00] where my skin graphs were just human feces going in yeah so you get an infection
[02:19:12] and you're worried like you're gonna get sent home but it turns out they don't they don't
[02:19:15] sent you on yeah go ahead no yeah my team you know when we got back you know i basically i
[02:19:23] had to tell our delta you know because it was bad he's man you need to go to calf and then when i
[02:19:28] got the calf they basically said they're like okay you're done in the panjoy we need to monitor you
[02:19:36] we don't you know we're not sure if you're gonna read a boy back to the states or not
[02:19:39] i knew if i read a boy back to the states that was a death wish as in and i don't mean literally but
[02:19:45] as in the command will know that this gamble that they took the let me go back to war
[02:19:51] it didn't pay off and i would never see combat again and so i i found work
[02:19:57] um i carried heavy shit and i made myself an important part of that and this was the first time
[02:20:04] in my life and so again it sounds really weird but stepping in this you know knee deep or i'm
[02:20:12] sorry calf deep and human feces led up to the first time in my life instead of saying poor
[02:20:20] me this happened to me why did i jump in that one trench and everything like that i owned it and i
[02:20:26] went and i found work and i and i made myself this valuable asset on calf load and helicopters
[02:20:31] to send supplies out to the guys in the field you know and still in combat and i i made you know
[02:20:38] made a name for myself is always getting these guys as if they needed one like that so i found work
[02:20:43] and then that was the first time that like that was a major victory for me of taking control
[02:20:50] over something that i very easily in the past what a straight went into victimization so
[02:20:58] so that here how long you doing that job for um i was doing that for
[02:21:05] probably the last three months of the deployment um and then you do you end up healing up
[02:21:12] decently and there's one more there's there ends up being a mission and the mission is is uh
[02:21:19] to go set up there's a big mission going on but you're gonna go with the command element you're
[02:21:23] gonna set up a command post on the top of a hill and that means you're gonna get inserted and
[02:21:28] you're gonna have to walk two kilometers but with three thousand feet of elevation gain and it's
[02:21:35] it's a it's a tough mission it's physically tough mission you you have some other strap hangers
[02:21:40] with you one of those guys wants to quit one of the other guys you guys end up having to carry
[02:21:44] other people's gear on that but you do it yeah you do it you do a good job you're healed up
[02:21:52] and luckily on the mission you know it's a it's a relatively peaceful mission yeah we we were
[02:21:59] supporting so the the seals and a bunch of ODA's we were clearing this valley together it was a joint
[02:22:06] mission and um and the command element last mission of the deployment command element wants to get
[02:22:12] you know boots on the ground say they did some and so yeah we yeah we were going up to hilltop
[02:22:18] 2000 and guys you know one guy he just flat out I mean it's already but quit and that's like I
[02:22:26] didn't think you can do that in combat yeah this is not training bro there's no training time out here
[02:22:32] and then another guy is body just failed him and so we were whole we were carrying all this stuff
[02:22:36] up to the top but I'm not big on spotlight range your kind of stuff but I knew for sure
[02:22:42] that I could solidify my career as a green beret if the kernel and the command sergeant major
[02:22:50] all saw me as a beast even though my body was oh that's that was another time when I learned like
[02:22:57] your mind quits way before your body will way before your body will and if you have if you
[02:23:04] you put this drive you you have this goal you want to reach and that goal is more important to you
[02:23:10] then your mind um given up on you then you will be able to see how much further you can actually
[02:23:19] go once your mind is told you you're done yeah I sometimes people like what do you do and you get
[02:23:24] what do you tell yourself when you don't want to do something and I'm like I don't tell myself
[02:23:29] anything because my mind is the one I'm just gonna I'm gonna be gonna keep you what I'm doing
[02:23:32] but like I don't have these negotiations with myself about like well you should really
[02:23:36] not like shut up keep going there's the answer yeah and it's it's hard until you make it a lifestyle
[02:23:44] yeah yeah that's the positive lifestyle we're looking for you get done with that mission
[02:23:51] you know you're a little while later you go back to America when you get back to America
[02:23:54] you're actually going to the normal seventh group rotation which seventh group's ayo
[02:24:01] is South America yep South Central America South Central America so you end up doing some
[02:24:08] do you call them deployments if they're if they're short what do you call those um so we we have
[02:24:12] CNTs or um J sets and I know seals you guys do J sets also yep you also do CNTs the counter
[02:24:21] in our cottage yeah okay so it's the same thing because we um I remember all of my deployments
[02:24:26] South Central America there was always um uh seal Patuens there so so you do some of those
[02:24:33] shorter trips and you go to L-SAL you go to Columbia you go to Peru and then I think you were
[02:24:41] getting ready to deploy to Guatemala and all of a sudden things change yeah they had um they
[02:24:50] requested it so Bravo Company second battalion was heading back to Afghanistan short on guys and
[02:24:58] so I saw I saw my in right there and I I started creating you know ways of finding my way over
[02:25:04] to Afghanistan somehow and that was that was all it took was I just I gave them the sales pitch
[02:25:11] and the original answer to your sales pitch was cool you can come but you're going to be
[02:25:15] not you know not not uh shooter yeah I was going to be riding a desk in managing um um uh
[02:25:25] just sources right right um so you so you're doing that that's your plan is to go over there
[02:25:33] you show up and uh about a month after you're there you get approached by the ops sergeant
[02:25:42] who says a new mission just got dropped in our laps you want to piece the action
[02:25:47] and uh you say yep and so you guys start planning this mission uh going to the book here the
[02:25:53] way we drew things up the Taliban would see the Afghan commandos heading into the village and fire
[02:25:57] at them knowing for certain that the Afghan soldiers would turn and run away like they had many
[02:26:02] times before once a bunch of Taliban assholes started shooting however that would be all we needed
[02:26:07] to call in close air support assets overhead which would give the Taliban a healthy taste of
[02:26:11] American firepower the insurgents would know in a New York minute that the Americans were in the
[02:26:16] fight and that would change the battlefield in a hurry and then you say on paper everything
[02:26:22] red well and I put a nice little exclamation point by that because as we know things that look
[02:26:30] good on paper don't always turn out the way you expect them to you proceed into this I'm going
[02:26:37] to fast forward a little bit um you're you're now executing the mission I could see our first target
[02:26:44] compound which was about a hundred meters up the path still had a long distance to clear and again
[02:26:50] this is after you you insert on the mission and we get done plan the mission you go
[02:26:54] insert on the mission you're moving you're moving to this first area that you're going to clear
[02:26:59] and the path started in narrow and rows of dormant fruit trees swallowed up the ground as we
[02:27:05] patrol deeper into the orchard I reminded myself to concentrate on significant details that were
[02:27:10] almost impossible to see under night vision and then pop with the fuck was that we all hit the ground
[02:27:16] unsure of the loud snap we just heard was a gunshot snipers in the area we waited for a shit storm
[02:27:21] of bullets to rain down on us but nothing happened then I noticed that jaw weed is that right
[02:27:26] yep Joey jaw weed and I were tangled in some type of line almost like fishing line holy shit
[02:27:34] we had hit a trip wire i.e. that didn't explode how did I miss that as jaw weed carefully
[02:27:41] investigated a trip wire against his chest without any quick movements I determined that the
[02:27:45] Taliban had tied the wire that ran from the set of explosives in in a mud wall all the way to a
[02:27:51] tree on the opposite side of the path the wire had been tied at chest level not the usual ankle
[02:27:56] height a clever move on the Taliban's part they knew we would be looking at our detectors to clear
[02:28:01] which meant we would be looking down at the dirt and walk right into a chest level trip wire
[02:28:07] why didn't the i.e. go off the best exclamation I could come up with was that the when the
[02:28:12] Overwatch element laid waste for five minutes firing everything they had into the orchard
[02:28:16] fragmentation from one of the mortars had hit the i.e. in disavvled it luck was on our side so
[02:28:21] there you go you're walking through this freaking orchard you hit a trip wire and for whatever
[02:28:26] reason probably the the preparatory fire that had been fired by your team had disrupt the
[02:28:32] die. we had cleared another 15 meters of path when I saw movement in an open field near the
[02:28:40] first compound I turned to Abe and Abe is one of your guys that you had with you one of your
[02:28:46] one of your afghans that you had with you and that was when it all hell broke out
[02:28:51] before Abe could respond the night was lit up by a barrage of gunfire coming from the compounds
[02:28:58] outer wall first it was a zip zip zip followed by the crack of 762 caliber rounds flying past our
[02:29:03] heads these rounds which rip holes in the darkness looked like a laser light show with tracer
[02:29:08] streaking across the night sky next came an explosion from an RPG being fired at us then more
[02:29:13] automatic fire we'd walk directly into an ambush shit with my heart beating out of my chest I hit
[02:29:18] the ground and started returning fire the Taliban the Taliban had set up a complex ambush
[02:29:24] ambush and the trip wire IED was supposed to start the whole thing off one of their pk
[02:29:28] machine guns let out a burst of 20 meters a burst of fire 20 meters from our position
[02:29:33] a distance so close that it was almost like I could grab the flame coming out of the end of the
[02:29:37] barrel jawede Abe and booze molla how do you say that best bezzmula bismula jump into the ditch
[02:29:44] well cahan con con okay just con well con darted back and took cover behind a tree
[02:29:53] I hit the deck and lay as flat as I could in the middle of the dirt path bullets kicked up and rock
[02:29:58] and gravel fragments all around me stinging my skin when bullets hit the ground around me
[02:30:03] splintering fragments sprayed everywhere I could tell some fragments struck my body armor's
[02:30:08] protective plate I was engaged I engaged the flames figuring that where there were flames there
[02:30:14] was a gun and where there was an AK 47 there was a fighter Ryan your strobe light my buddy Zach
[02:30:21] yelled over the radio they have NVGs they can see your strobe damn bro what were you thinking
[02:30:29] when you heard that I need to get this off comment I need to get this I are strobe away from me
[02:30:37] and our jatac couldn't see me because we had got caught up in an L shaped ambush and so he wasn't
[02:30:45] sure where the pkm was and that's you know so I took it off my helmet and I threw it as close as I
[02:30:51] could to where that pkm was at and then just hit the deck again and started engaging muzzle flashes
[02:30:57] and the jatac went you through the IR could he see it could the jatac see it so it's kind of funny
[02:31:03] um so I said you know you guys have visual on the IR and yeah and go okay they're they're over
[02:31:09] that direction he goes what in a while so uh going back here there's one guy that starts peeking out
[02:31:23] and you you actually end up killing this guy the third time he came out he took more time
[02:31:27] when the previous two tries attempting to a better shot off at us it was like he was daring
[02:31:32] me to light his ass up I knew I had him I locked in with a clear shot and let go a 10 to 15 round
[02:31:37] burst from my him for I watched him drop his body lay still on the ground it felt good to kill him
[02:31:42] but I couldn't relish the moment too long we were still pinned down our main element which was about
[02:31:47] 25 to 30 meters behind our position put as much fire power on the enemy as they could hoping to keep
[02:31:52] their heads down long enough for US aircraft to start dropping bombs I knew from the many fights I'd been
[02:31:58] in before in this country that a call for air support had been made within seconds of their attack
[02:32:03] in the meantime Frankie's position let loose this one of your other teammates but the Taliban
[02:32:09] were well protected behind mud walls unless they stepped out the open like the guy with the Rpg launcher
[02:32:14] there wasn't much we could do without an air strike at the same time I was aware given how close
[02:32:20] we were to the enemy that being killed by friendly fire was a very real worry yeah
[02:32:26] so you're you're 15 to 20 meters away from these bad guys yes the first peak and just so anyone that's
[02:32:36] wondering 15 to 20 meters is not a long way you know when you're gonna try and drop bombs
[02:32:43] yeah there's danger close and then there's common in on your position and it's yeah it's a little dicey
[02:32:50] this is getting a lot dicey yeah as our situation deteriorated by the second I knew that without
[02:32:57] bombs on target Jawede Abe Bismula Khan and I would all die this was about to turn into a body
[02:33:07] recovery mission and it would be our bodies that would be that they would be taking home within a
[02:33:13] couple of minutes the decision was made for us when our Air Force J-Tak J-Tak called in a
[02:33:18] 500-pound bomb just 20 meters from my position this was considered a danger close strike I don't
[02:33:25] even know if that's considered danger that's that's called on my position yeah especially five
[02:33:31] hundred pounds hmm this was considered a danger close strike but one that would give us a
[02:33:36] fighting chance of making it out of the orchard alive they call it went out over the radio and then I
[02:33:40] heard Air Force J-Tak's voice in my earpiece Ryan were dropping close to you man keep your
[02:33:47] fucking head down after receiving the radio transmission I relayed the information to Abe who told
[02:33:52] the others to get as low as they could there wasn't enough room in the ditch so I grabbed Khan
[02:33:56] and pushed him into the trench while I stayed on the footpath I ordered them to hunker down
[02:34:00] or prepare for the blast since we weren't firing back at the enemy the volume of fire on our
[02:34:04] position picked up so now you guys are gongering down because you're expecting this bomb and now
[02:34:09] this the enemy's thinking they got an upper hand overhead I could hear the rocket motors of the
[02:34:15] F-16 ripping through the sky as the fighter jet came in bound I received one last warning over the
[02:34:22] radio bombs away man stay low I lay as flat as I could on the path holding my hands over my head
[02:34:28] and planting my face in the dirt then I slightly tilted my head and opened my mouth to give the
[02:34:32] over pressure or shockwave a place to exit all I could do is wait for the blast when the bomb hit
[02:34:38] the over pressure from the explosion sent grass dirt gravel dust and tree branches flying in
[02:34:44] our direction I waited for the big chunks of mud of the mud compound to land on me as well as
[02:34:49] bits of earth another debris thankfully I was spared from the hunk some mud wall heating me
[02:34:54] which would have broken my back instead I was covered with dirt leaves and branches but the
[02:34:58] concussive force was so great that I felt like my skeleton had just walked out of my body
[02:35:03] turned slap me in the face and re-entered my body I tried to stand up I kept falling
[02:35:08] I almost felt like I was drunk yeah a few of a 500 pound bond go off freaking your rocked yeah
[02:35:15] it's like you just got like when you see someone get knocked out in the in in the UFC
[02:35:21] that's what you just got hit with. Yep only not just to the jaw but to the entire body
[02:35:28] in all my time in Afghanistan I'd get to experience a concussive explosion of that magnitude
[02:35:32] it took a good minute to regain my senses just as I was figuring out what happened I heard
[02:35:36] my guy screaming over the radio Ryan are you good Ryan answer your fucking radio if you're alive
[02:35:41] their voices sounded like someone is yelling down a long tunnel trying to get my attention I got my
[02:35:46] bearings fuck that was good that was big big but I'm good man I answered I couldn't believe what
[02:35:52] it just happened how big of a bomb was that 500 pounds brother used a big one man and I'm still alive
[02:35:59] I thought I had come away without a scratch until I felt warm liquid coming out of my ears
[02:36:04] from the monstrous blast damn that was close there was no time to worry about my the ear drip
[02:36:10] because I had no idea if the enemy was still moving around or all tapped out I took a moment to
[02:36:15] shake the cobwebs out of my head then I checked on my guys to ensure they were good after everyone
[02:36:20] was accounted for un-injured I had my guys fall back to the closest position which was 20 meters behind us
[02:36:25] once we were back with the main element our jatac called in another strike which would ensure that
[02:36:30] if anyone was still moving in the compound they were sure to be dead damn that's uh that's freaking
[02:36:44] psycho crazy right there dropping a 500 pound bomb at 20 meters like I said that's I mean we'll have
[02:36:51] to ask a good deal Dave Burke and see what the you know what what the error box is on that yeah
[02:36:59] you know I will re-oj attack I was a jac and like 20 meters is tight
[02:37:06] that's a tight one but they do it that's what they do you know they got GPS guided
[02:37:10] musicians and they do they do drop right in a spot yeah they actually had to switch out aircraft
[02:37:16] or switch out platforms to drop a non-fragmentation producing like a concuss because of how close we
[02:37:24] were and it it took like five minutes to get bombs on target and anyone who's been in a tick before
[02:37:30] five minutes yeah really long time well salute to your jac because that's a balls you call right there
[02:37:36] yep he's a freaking legit yeah I remember him saying he's like man if I if I would have killed
[02:37:42] you my career's done I was like thank you don't worry about your bro yeah yeah the deed the
[02:37:51] deeds that amazing same my life oh yeah for sure that's crazy you know that's when I was a
[02:37:58] jac they would when you had to call danger close you have to give your initials I don't know if
[02:38:02] they still do this but you have to give your initials saying like I'm signing for this bomb this
[02:38:08] is on me and you need to drop this bomb and you like they would be off that to get with you
[02:38:13] a jac initials or something I forget the actual calls but the MC Juliet whiskey drop it in
[02:38:19] boom so you now you go you you go you clear this compound the sun started to come up
[02:38:29] it's kind of settled down the situations kind of settled down a little bit the sun started to come
[02:38:35] up you're feeling good about that because now it makes ideas easier to find then you start moving
[02:38:44] to another compound and and once again you're just like finding ideas trippy ideas and still just
[02:38:52] moving from compound to compound clearing more ideas as you enter these other compounds there's
[02:38:58] there's not any movement or anything you say during the rest of our clearance I encountered
[02:39:03] more than 20 ideas hmm I personally blew up 15 before I ran out of c4 explosives we marked the
[02:39:10] rest um overall we located more than 50 ideas 470 170 millimeter rockets multiple booby traps
[02:39:20] and a complex bunker and tunnel system this particular part of the village lived up to its
[02:39:25] reputation as a hotbed for Taliban fighters the Taliban had reinforced bunkers spread throughout
[02:39:30] the village many connecting with tunnels that's freaking psycho I mean runnin into
[02:39:40] 50 ideas during the mall yeah it's um yeah the ones we couldn't clear we just had to mark and bypass
[02:39:48] it was yeah that village was a super nasty super nasty so then there's this little
[02:39:56] discussion between the Afghan force leader who after you guys clear these places
[02:40:02] your the goal is hey the Afghan stay there to you know prohibit the Taliban from coming in and
[02:40:11] taking over so there's a little bit of a discussion because you know American forces are going to leave
[02:40:16] okay we did the hard part and cleared everything now you stay there and occupy and build defenses
[02:40:22] and set up claimors and you know secure the area and hold onto it well they don't want to do that
[02:40:28] and so this discussion is happening and while this discussion is happening which by the way
[02:40:35] your team leader says the Afghan says the American should say not my Afghan soldiers you're
[02:40:41] better equipped to fight the Taliban and the team leader says if this was Texas I would agree with you
[02:40:46] but we're in Afghanistan this is your country I'm here to help you but not when your battles
[02:40:52] so as this little discussion's going on one year Afghan one of the Afghan commandos comes up to you
[02:40:57] and with with the interpreter and says there's 15 to 20 men moving our way yep and
[02:41:04] you know the discussions still going on a few seconds later the Afghan commandos tugged on my
[02:41:10] shirt sleeve to get my attention again the men are heading this way we need to do something
[02:41:16] because I don't think these are villagers from the area he said I went back to my team sergeant
[02:41:20] was more direct we need to get out of here we have fighting age males moving in our direction
[02:41:24] I'm grabbing my guys and getting into positions to move out the team sergeant not not it
[02:41:28] fuck this he said I'm done to go she ate with these guys let's move out he had barely finished
[02:41:33] this sentence when the first shot was by my head with the all two familiar zip followed by a crack
[02:41:41] we were immediately in the fight for our lives
[02:41:47] rounds were coming in all round
[02:41:49] from automatic machine gunfire series of RPG explosions took us by total surprise
[02:41:56] everything turned into total chaos in an instant everything was happening so fast it was
[02:42:00] impossible for the human brain to comprehend it instinctively I knew I was sprinting for cover
[02:42:04] but for a split second I felt frozen in pandemonium of everything happening around me
[02:42:10] while my brain scrambled to make sense of the attacks ferocity now I was moving quickly
[02:42:16] screaming instructions and returning fired an enemy I could not see round sprayed everywhere hitting
[02:42:20] compound walls like a garden hose watering down a dusty road just then I heard a grunt as if you
[02:42:26] was hurt that was that's one of your afghans but for some reason it didn't occur to me that he
[02:42:30] could have been hit I darted toward a ditch that paralleled the dirt road running through the village
[02:42:34] after diving for cover I peered out cautiously but I couldn't see any of my guys or where we were
[02:42:40] taking fire from bullets were telling up dirt all around me as we tried to stay as low as possible
[02:42:46] then I noticed that three commandos in the ditch ten meters from my position had drawn the
[02:42:51] attention of a towel band machine gun crew that had zeroed in on them I waved for the three afghans
[02:42:56] to move to my position which would give them more cover but they were too scared to move I knew that
[02:43:00] if they didn't get their asses in gear and start moving they were gonna die I don't know what possessed
[02:43:05] me but I climbed out from my ditch and sprinted to their position praying to God that my
[02:43:09] adaptive leg would hold up I reached the first commando and grabbed the very first thing that I could
[02:43:15] get a hold of his hair I yanked him out up and pulled him back to my ditch holding the other two
[02:43:20] would follow they did as we ran dust kicked up and more rounds impacted around us I slid into the ditch
[02:43:26] like I was licking out a triple then I reached back and dragged the three scared shit let's
[02:43:31] commandos down with me we had company in this part of the ditch Frankie was providing aid to another
[02:43:36] wounded afghan Frankie you okay man I'm good brother how about you yeah I'm okay you see aber
[02:43:41] anyone else not yet man I moved closer to a small mud wall that paralleled the ditch this wall
[02:43:47] provided decent protection from enemy fire and allowed me to look down the dirt road where I saw
[02:43:51] an afghan soldier lying motionless I brought up my rifle scope to get a better look Frankie I
[02:43:58] think that's buzmula in the middle of the road bro I think he's dead my heart jumped straight to my
[02:44:04] throat one of our guys was killed fuck where's the rest of my team Frankie and I were the only two
[02:44:08] Americans in that ditch I scanned back down the road where vizmula lay I knew a was next to him
[02:44:15] before the ambush kicked off but I could only see bizmula I hoped abe wasn't hit to what I could
[02:44:24] determine was that we had two wounded afghan commandos and bizmula lying in the middle of the road
[02:44:31] I figured bizmula was dead but until I had my hands on him I couldn't be a hundred percent sure
[02:44:36] I knew I needed to get to him but the amount of life fire coming in was too heavy
[02:44:41] the radio crackled again and then I heard a heart stomping message in my headset loud and clear
[02:44:49] Eagles down Eagles down
[02:44:52] The phrase Eagles down was code for Americans wounded or killed the fight had just taken the worst possible turn
[02:44:59] There were Americans wounded or killed somewhere on the battlefield but I didn't know where we needed some air support in a hurry
[02:45:13] How much time has passed and when I just read and I skipped a little bit of stuff but this is all
[02:45:18] I remember few minutes now I remember we were basically screaming for air support and they couldn't because the
[02:45:28] Taliban
[02:45:29] With the tunnel systems they were in our lines and they couldn't drop because they couldn't distinguish who was who
[02:45:35] And so yeah, if he came a fist fight at that point
[02:45:44] Here's the understatement of the year coming from you back to the book bro this shit is bad
[02:45:49] I said to Frankie no sooner did the words leave my lips than I heard one sound that gives every green
[02:45:54] Break chills and explosion from a morgue around which landed 30 meters from us and shook the earth
[02:46:01] I hit the ground and turned toward Frankie shit. I yelled they got a mortar tube up
[02:46:06] We need to move before we get hit so for anyone that doesn't know anything about mortars
[02:46:13] When you shoot mortars you don't hit what you're aiming at on the first shot usually you have to do something called bracketing
[02:46:20] Which means you fire your first shot and oh it goes long so you back your distance off a little bit
[02:46:25] You fire your next shot. It's probably gonna be short and then you split the difference and your neck shots are on target
[02:46:31] So when you're getting more dirt if you sit there they're gonna bracket you. They're gonna find you and they're gonna get you
[02:46:40] Gun fire is one thing if the enemy is close enough to shoot at you. He's close and you're close enough to kill him mortars are different
[02:46:46] They can be two or three kilometers away and engage you with Debbie fire and by the time you figure out where they're coming from
[02:46:53] It's too late another explosion hit the compound to the left of us two close for comfort
[02:46:58] That was our cue time to make a move
[02:47:01] Frankie and I engage Talbot targets as much as possible trying to keep their heads down with return fire
[02:47:05] Which would give us a little time to pick up our wounded afghans and move back
[02:47:09] Crack around hit directly in the wall above my head crack another round two close for comfort crack and another one
[02:47:15] Then two more rounds hit the mud wall in front of us a sniper had our position dialed in every time we stuck our heads up
[02:47:21] He sent rounds our way to make matters worse the Taliban were dropping mortars closer and closer to our position
[02:47:27] One of the afghan commandos besides us spoke a little English. He pointed to his radio and said he heard the Taliban had our position and we're trying to capture us
[02:47:38] Hearing that word struck fear in my heart. I'd nudged Frankie again the Taliban are trying to flank us and cut us off in the restaurant
[02:47:44] Our guys so they can take us it's time to move brother. I shouted
[02:47:48] First things first how do we avoid getting shot by the sniper? I saw protected area near a compound a couple of hundred meters from us
[02:47:54] Where I recognized several Americans including our medic Joe Frankie I see Joe. Let's move to him
[02:48:03] So you guys gather everyone up
[02:48:06] And you
[02:48:07] Finally like are able to get over to this other position where Joe is
[02:48:13] Joe's your medic. He's working on guys
[02:48:16] You get their all blood moons and cries for help stay to shock could be seen on the commandos faces
[02:48:21] We knew we were in a real shit storm
[02:48:23] So far we had one dead afghan commando two wounded afghans three wounded Americans
[02:48:29] We were missing five afghans
[02:48:31] Including Abe and Bismula who are your two guys
[02:48:34] Yes
[02:48:42] And still no air support
[02:48:44] At that point in time once we were able to get back to the CCP
[02:48:49] Well the first CCP
[02:48:51] We were able to start dropping bombs on on the targets probably 45 minutes into the tick and then
[02:48:58] They came up about a tunnels and engaged us at that first CCP which means we had to find another CCP
[02:49:03] How are you doing for ammo
[02:49:06] We're handing mags off
[02:49:13] So you're in this first casualty collection point CCP so for those of you who don't know this is when you're in a bad situation
[02:49:20] And you've got casualties you want to get to a point where you can gather all the casualties together
[02:49:24] So you can number one provide security number two provide medical attention and the number three
[02:49:29] Trying to figure out where you're tactically can get them out of there. Mm-hmm
[02:49:35] So you're in this CCP. I looked around for a jawede and con jawede was sitting up against a wall trying to catch his breath
[02:49:42] Grabbing ghost aren't turperder. I asked him if you knew where Abe was jawede shook his head. No, I haven't seen Abe
[02:49:48] Just then I saw Frankie con and two afghan commandos carrying Bismula from the road to the CCP
[02:49:54] Bismula's alive, but he can't feel his legs Frankie said thank God we got biz, but where's Abe? I asked
[02:50:00] A puzzle look came over Frankie no one has seen Abe since the firing started bro. He's still out there
[02:50:11] Fast forward a little bit now that we had most of our friendly forces back in one location our aircraft could start
[02:50:17] Engaging targets up first was the white two story former school building and these are things you explain
[02:50:22] These are areas where you're taken fire from um after 45 minutes of intense fighting we finally dropped our first bomb
[02:50:29] As they have 15 jet screamed across the sky and extremely close to our position the first bomb dropped
[02:50:33] The white building was reduced to wooden debris in a nanosecond instantly killing the sniper inside
[02:50:40] Fast forward a little bit at that point we had two wounded afghans three wounded Americans and now two dead afghan commandos
[02:50:46] 300 meters to the right of the compound was another mud hot compound with tall walls for protection and a large open field big enough for helicopters to land in
[02:50:56] This was gonna have to work because we need to get going we picked up and quickly moved to our new location and started calling a dust off
[02:51:02] Which was our call sign our radio call sign for medical evacuation
[02:51:07] So now you move into this bigger compound and
[02:51:11] You're preparing to get helicopters in there to get the wounded and dead out of there
[02:51:15] You go over to Bismillah. I calmly asked him if he knew where Ab was
[02:51:22] Ab was next to me when we started fighting he said and then he jumped into the ditch near the foot bridge at the last compound
[02:51:29] We cleared
[02:51:30] Okay, now I had a starting point, but we couldn't move or go near that area of the village the enemy was too well dug in every time we poked our heads above the near
[02:51:39] Road we got lit up by the Taliban somehow I had to get Abe I was not leaving him behind
[02:51:48] I had an Afghan commando pointing to the foot bridge saying another commando was there with Abe that meant two wounded guys now
[02:51:55] Which also meant I would need more help our Air Force J tax said he had a plan to keep the Taliban's head down
[02:52:01] While we sprinted for the foot bridge
[02:52:04] I'll call the Apache's to fly in front of your movement and shoot the shit out of everything ahead of you
[02:52:09] Guys, I like the way that sounded
[02:52:13] Little cover move with the helicopters
[02:52:17] At the same time we were putting together our two minute game plan the team sergeant stopped us
[02:52:22] We can't risk you going down there to get those guys. He said too much enemy fire
[02:52:26] Well, we're not leaving them behind. I said my team sergeant wasn't happy with my answer
[02:52:31] But he knew what we had to do. I spoke up again if we leave without them we could go we could have a mute knee on our hands with the Afghans
[02:52:36] We have to go no one gets left behind
[02:52:41] The team sergeant looked at us knowing this was something that must happen. Okay. We'll go he said
[02:52:47] This was going to be an American-led recovery operation
[02:52:50] Why the Afghan commandos wouldn't go recover their own guys was beyond me if an American had been left behind
[02:52:55] We would go to hellem back for our to get our brothers out dead or alive
[02:52:59] The J tack interrupted the discussion stating the Apache's were inbound to do a gun run on enemy positions
[02:53:05] We needed to use cover this cover as our chance to move
[02:53:09] Here they come everyone ready the J tack asked it was go time
[02:53:16] The sounds of the large caliber bullets echoed off the compound walls is the Apache's open fire
[02:53:21] Blanketing the area with 30 millimeter rounds
[02:53:23] Frankie our J tack our team sergeant and I sprinted down the road toward the area
[02:53:28] Where we assumed Abe in the mission missing commando were as we ran like hell in the direction of the foot bridge
[02:53:34] We took on small arms fire, but nothing compared to what it could have been if those Apache's weren't helping us
[02:53:42] The closer I got to the foot bridge though the more I prepared myself for what I might see
[02:53:47] Leading up to the bridge the terrain shifted upwards slightly making it hard to see what was in the ditch
[02:53:51] I was almost to the foot bridge when I looked down there float floating lifeless in the water at the bottom of the ditch was Abe
[02:53:58] His body was sprawled out with a blood soaked bandage around his pelvic area Abe had attempted to stop the bleeding himself
[02:54:07] But I knew that pelvic wounds were almost impossible to treat without proper medical help
[02:54:13] Abe had blood out so much that the muddy water in the ditch had turned bright red my friend was dead and I could not save him
[02:54:19] A Taliban sniper had perfectly placed three rounds into his pelvis. Oh Abe, they finally got you
[02:54:31] As I got to his body in the ditch, Frankie was providing covering fire while the team sergeant
[02:54:36] Nia attempted to pull Abe out lifting a lifeless body out of a six foot muddy ditch was especially difficult
[02:54:42] Adding to the difficulties was the fact that Abe's body was covered in blood
[02:54:45] Which made him extremely slippery to hold onto we couldn't get a good grip on him and struggled to carry his body up to dry ground
[02:54:53] I became more and more drenched in the Abe's blood and even got some of his blood in my mouth a taste that's forever etched in my mind
[02:55:00] Finally after giving it everything we had we freed Abe from his watery grave but the smells the tastes and everything about that moment still hauled me to this day
[02:55:14] Kind of kind of it's I mean not only does it say a lot about the American soldier in the American fighting man that you four go down to recover the body of these Afghans
[02:55:35] Also obviously says a lot about the Afghans who
[02:55:37] Don't go to go and recover their own people
[02:55:45] But that's you know to me it's a lot of it's just a cast to do with the value of human life that we have as Americans like we see we we value human life more
[02:55:54] And the bond that we have is so strong and it's just it's a it's a real tribute to
[02:56:01] The American soldier that you're you're going you're risking your life and your friends are risking your lives your lives as Americans to go and
[02:56:11] Basically you know that these guys are dead. I mean that's your suspicion
[02:56:15] Yeah, but you're still not gonna leave these guys behind knowing you're so happy
[02:56:20] You get you get Abe out of the trench and you you basically you find a ladder that that you use as a stretcher
[02:56:35] You put them on this thing on this ladder you carrying him into the compound as you're carrying them into the compound
[02:56:42] There's Afghans commandos that are just standing there watching you struggle
[02:56:44] We got back to the book don't just stand there fucking helpless. I screamed at the commandos
[02:56:51] But they stood there like statues. We continued on the landing zone to wait for the helicopter
[02:56:56] I was carrying I was helping carry get Abe
[02:57:00] Carried Abe on the makes shift gurney when I saw the helicopter hovering over it had finally hit me my buddy was really dead
[02:57:06] My heart sank when the helicopter touched down
[02:57:08] I helped load Abe onto the last flight you would ever take I reached out and grabbed his lifeless hand as the helicopter lifted off from the ground to take him away
[02:57:18] Yes, Abe was gone
[02:57:20] But we had recovered his body so that his family could give him a proper burial a true warriors funeral
[02:57:27] If the Taliban had recovered his body they would have desecrated it instead we did right by him
[02:57:33] As American fighting men and women we have one belief we will fight and die for no one gets left behind
[02:57:57] Yeah
[02:57:59] And you know in the book you go into a little bit about both Abe and
[02:58:05] This mula who you knew well and their backgrounds what kind of guys they were you know the the what they had fallen tiered to do right
[02:58:15] And you know like as I'm sitting here calling you crazy for want to go back and find I eds
[02:58:21] If you're if you're part of the Afghan team guess what guess how long you're deployment last forever
[02:58:27] Right
[02:58:28] So these guys are out there hanging it out there and you know you had that bond with them and then you stayed true to that bond
[02:58:41] What was the what was the I mean you know obviously shortly after this you you end up getting the rest of the team out
[02:58:49] What was the total losses for that day?
[02:58:53] That day we ended up with four Americans WIA
[02:58:58] eight Afghans carry a and 12 Afghans
[02:59:02] So it was pretty bad day
[02:59:05] How big was the force going in we have conflicting reports the last report
[02:59:10] I remember seeing as we killed over 400 Taliban now air craft killed over 400 Taliban
[02:59:16] We you know personally probably
[02:59:18] You know 10 20 at small arms and but that's still a pretty big force
[02:59:22] But I'm over 400 how many guys did you have total how many Afghans how big was the Afghan command O unit?
[02:59:29] We
[02:59:30] 100 and I think about a 120 Afghans and then an ODA and an ODB so
[02:59:36] About 25 Americans about 120 Afghans
[02:59:45] How how
[02:59:47] How much longer were you in country after that operation that it actually just started to deploy them off so we still had another
[02:59:57] I think I'd say five more months and what was the what was the rest of the point of like
[03:00:03] It was it was back to just trying to try to chase you know chase that elusive combat again, but
[03:00:12] Nothing nothing came even close to touching a
[03:00:15] Baglin and did they did they throw you back in because you you're original purpose on that deployment was more of work
[03:00:22] And the Intel side yep, did you get moved back into that and that's kind of what you spent most of the deployment
[03:00:27] Yes, I did yeah, I was I was moved back into the into the Intel role of it and I would um, you know
[03:00:34] I would constantly try and create work and find myself on missions and whatnot
[03:00:37] But yeah, I was back you know doing those reports
[03:00:41] I'm gonna fast forward a little bit
[03:00:46] To your head and home when our
[03:00:49] 2016 tour due to his over into lie our team bordered a
[03:00:53] C17 at Bogramar field and flew west until we landed at Eglonair force base near Pensacola floor to falling a fuel stop at Ramstein air base in Germany
[03:01:02] We basically hop from the dangers of the Afghan
[03:01:05] And from from the dangers of Afghanistan to tranquil floored up within 24 hours the quickest I ever returned home
[03:01:12] I still had to afghanistan dirt underneath my fingernails
[03:01:15] I didn't realize that I had suffered traumatic brain injury
[03:01:19] During the firefight where the 500 pound bomb had landed just 17 meters from my position
[03:01:26] Binge drinking on weekends became the norm for me fast forward in a little bit including consumption of a lot of beer at home
[03:01:33] I could easily clear 12 to 15 millilights in an evening
[03:01:39] And you know you you again, it's really good because in this book you go through some of the details of what's happening when you come home from deployment
[03:01:48] you know
[03:01:50] You have that kind of
[03:01:53] What is it little empty feeling that we get something like that and you're trying to fill it up you're trying to figure out
[03:01:59] You know what this is how how to adjust back to being in Florida or wherever you're gonna be
[03:02:08] So you're doing
[03:02:11] You're doing the path which is easily available to us when we come home which is drinking fighting causing problems
[03:02:22] Little road rage activity
[03:02:24] You're with Dawn and are you married to Dawn at this point?
[03:02:28] No, we got married in 18. So you got your girlfriend Dawn and you're you're like driving and you're with Dawn
[03:02:36] And I'm gonna look here the dude suddenly turned into this is oh, yeah, he cuts you off
[03:02:41] Right driving and you get your road rage on and you follow him
[03:02:46] What kind of vehicle you driving? I was driving in Tundra. Okay, check
[03:02:51] So you're driving your Tundra this dude suddenly turned into a driveway and ran into the house
[03:02:55] I slid into the curb and put my truck and park
[03:02:58] I was about to run after him when Dawn grabbed my arm. What are you doing?
[03:03:03] She asked are you gonna chase him down beat him up and then what what if we've got guns in the house?
[03:03:08] What makes you think he doesn't have them?
[03:03:10] This is stupid. What's going on with you right now?
[03:03:12] She had a point. I let out a huge breath of air which dialed back the adrenaline surging through my body
[03:03:18] Fuck this I mumbled as I got back into the truck. I used away from the curb and turned home word
[03:03:22] For the next 10 minutes neither of us set a word my mind was locked on this thought
[03:03:27] You need to get your temper under control damn it. I was a green beret
[03:03:32] That man I was professional and flipping the switch between civilian life and being in a war zone was the professional thing to do
[03:03:40] Yet here I was acting like a bully if someone did something I didn't like I took some active measures over the next few days in weeks
[03:03:47] I opened up to my friend Mike Valke. How he says?
[03:03:51] Yeah, I opened up to my friend Mike Valke Tyler and Frankie about some of my struggles
[03:03:56] It turned out I wasn't alone after sharing my innermost thoughts with Frankie he said he was going through the same
[03:04:03] Issues is me finally someone gets it
[03:04:07] And this is where you started kind of getting control though nothing happened overnight
[03:04:11] I slowly got my shit under control my anger issues at times were still an open question
[03:04:16] But I started to focus on what triggered me which helped me ratchet my aggression way down
[03:04:24] Yeah, I kind of I kind of spoiler alerted on the on the marriage thing, but luckily
[03:04:30] I didn't spoil much because in a very romantic fashion and an apple bees parking lot
[03:04:35] You asked Dawn if she would marry you
[03:04:41] You got married
[03:04:43] um
[03:04:45] You get cleared to do another seven month appointment to
[03:04:49] Afghanistan in August of 2018 ends in March of 2019
[03:04:56] You say in the book here in a few words my last appointment to Afghanistan was boring and cold
[03:05:01] You you detail some of these missions
[03:05:03] You also say that boring has tons of upside for coming back with all your limbs which is good
[03:05:08] And you did make it home from that deployment
[03:05:14] With all your limbs, but
[03:05:17] And you did make it home and not and obviously as we know not everybody does and I want to close out this book
[03:05:22] You know you detail some more information and
[03:05:26] But I want to close out the book
[03:05:31] In the actually in the acknowledgments when you address the fact that not everyone comes home
[03:05:36] Then you say last I want to point out the men who epitomize heroic courage and whom I look up to for strength
[03:05:46] Ben Harrow
[03:05:49] Will lials and leave i Rogers. Yes, those guys are wounded
[03:05:54] Yes, leave i he
[03:05:56] He was in a
[03:05:58] Max Pro or
[03:05:59] Argy that hit an ied
[03:06:01] Everyone died but him and it so that was chief Rogers
[03:06:04] Ben was my team leader
[03:06:07] When I got hit and then on the 2012 deployment he stepped on an ied last both of his legs and then will lials
[03:06:16] He was one of my friends that I went through the course with and this basically the same time frame that I
[03:06:22] Stepped on my ied he stepped on his and lost both of his legs so
[03:06:28] You say these three men of a definition of what it means to overcome astronomical odds
[03:06:33] To go through hell and back only to come out stronger on the other side
[03:06:37] I will forever be grateful for the lessons i learned from them as well as their strength and determination in putting aside their catastrophic injuries to show me the true value of life
[03:06:49] They remind me that no matter what life throws at you or how bad you think you have it
[03:06:54] You can always pick yourself up off the ground and kick life in the ass
[03:06:59] For the men in heaven keeping a watchful i on us
[03:07:06] I salute you
[03:07:09] May God hold you close and give you the comfort you all deserve
[03:07:14] Until we meet again. I will do my best to live the life you all embodied while you are here
[03:07:20] Still walking among us
[03:07:32] So
[03:07:34] That's the
[03:07:35] Like I said this is a powerful book and we're reading this very small percentage of it
[03:07:44] I would definitely recommend go out get this book read the full story
[03:07:47] I mean it's just powerful and it's a powerful tribute you know that powerful tribute at the end to
[03:07:53] All these guys and it's just it's just amazing when you think about
[03:07:58] The sacrifices that have been made by by the service men and women in this country has been just
[03:08:04] We should net we can never ever allow that to be forgotten and I think this book is a is a personal account of some of those sacrifices
[03:08:13] What so what's going on now?
[03:08:21] So I actually um I retired from the army in in January of
[03:08:27] 2000 or 2020 and was that was that 20 years?
[03:08:32] Yeah 21 and some change and then within a week I was back in Afghanistan as a as a contractor
[03:08:39] So I gave my time about I gave myself about five days to
[03:08:44] Celebrate retirement that I was back at it and that's what you're doing now you're doing contracting yes
[03:08:50] And you're continuing to go how how long are you going on deployments now?
[03:08:54] So these are these are four month deployments
[03:08:57] Cermin virus had a little something to do with the last one so we stayed longer, but um
[03:09:03] The next one I have coming up is that'll be a four month there and then
[03:09:06] We'll kind of readress
[03:09:09] Readress, you know what's going on in Afghanistan and what and I like that what um
[03:09:14] You talk about in the book, but I didn't read through it. I what point did you start writing the book?
[03:09:20] So the book actually
[03:09:22] It started off as as therapy and when I came back from the 16 trip
[03:09:27] The road regents and it was won, but there was there was multiple other ones, but um
[03:09:32] And and so I actually you know, I remember going to a therapist
[03:09:38] Army you know count our counselor therapist whatever they're called and he was kind of going down as list and I remember asking him is like
[03:09:46] What's my name?
[03:09:48] And I saw as I as had to go up to the top right hand corner and I was like I'm done here
[03:09:53] So I started you know, I you know our chaplains and group are very close with us and
[03:09:58] And I I remember I'm talking to one of them just and my biggest my biggest issue was like all three of us
[03:10:06] We could be we could be sitting out of our drinking beer and talking about you know things and what we deal with and whatnot like that
[03:10:13] And then you go home to your family you go home years and I go home to mine and it's dead air
[03:10:18] It was it was talked about but nothing was really like
[03:10:21] Taking off your chest and so our chaplain is like have you ever thought about writing so no
[03:10:28] I haven't I majored in you know English and like the third grade
[03:10:32] There's no I've never thought about writing so the 2017 deployment
[03:10:37] So I went to Afghanistan 16 17 18
[03:10:42] And then back in our 2019
[03:10:45] In 2019 and 2020 so pretty much since 16 I've been in Afghanistan every year and
[03:10:53] And in the 17 trip I just remembered
[03:10:57] just needing
[03:10:58] To to just get stuff off my chest and and I remember I was you know as I was in my little little little live in area
[03:11:06] And I just opened my laptop and just started typing and typing and it just and it felt good because I was I was taking I was taking these these
[03:11:14] These um I'll call them items, but I was taking these items that that had been bothering me for years or been or
[03:11:22] Just anything and I wasn't just talking about it and it was dead air not to be you know
[03:11:28] Half in the be re-adrusted again, but I was putting it on something else that was tangible a word document
[03:11:34] And so I could come back to that word document anytime I wanted and it actually felt like you know
[03:11:39] I was I was taking this off of my chest and I was putting it somewhere
[03:11:44] That was actually tangible now it was something and
[03:11:48] It felt great and that's and that's when I said oh
[03:11:52] Writing therapy
[03:11:53] God ya makes sense now
[03:11:55] But and then from that
[03:11:58] Came the book so yeah, you know it's uh
[03:12:01] I always talk about using detachment is is what you have to do that as a person you have to get you have to
[03:12:07] Attach for your emotions you can't get all look I'm not saying you need to leave all your motion totally behind
[03:12:12] But I'm saying you have to detach from them somewhat and
[03:12:16] What's cool about writing and this is I was trying to figure out what you meant by this
[03:12:21] So it's just dead air and I was like oh wait a second. I get it
[03:12:25] When you write something down
[03:12:27] You are you are actually
[03:12:29] Detaching from it right you get to see those words are coming out they're going somewhere else now
[03:12:33] You're looking at those words and so it gives you a
[03:12:35] An actual physical form of detachment from the thoughts that you have from the feelings that you have from the emotions that you have
[03:12:43] And then you can read them you can read them from a distance and you can understand them better
[03:12:48] And then as you continue to work through the writing that you're doing and it it's another way to reprocess it and
[03:12:56] Ted you ever I I actually don't think I think I guess I have heard the term writing therapy
[03:13:00] But like I guess it's a thing, huh?
[03:13:03] I never heard about it before until that point. Yeah, but did you just make that up yourself?
[03:13:09] Or I think I heard I
[03:13:11] So when I had when when I started typing
[03:13:16] Writing therapy that was that was
[03:13:19] Purely what I just thought it was but I think I've heard of it before like I do think it's a thing
[03:13:24] Yeah, I think it's a thing. I think it's a thing too. We're gonna have to find out if not
[03:13:29] We're gonna have to trade market you should trade market
[03:13:31] These
[03:13:32] Maybe that's why I've just written books all the time just provide in therapy for myself and so then now what
[03:13:39] What did you do how did you get the book published so I went?
[03:13:42] Yeah, that that was kind of a funny situation so I basically I had all of these notes
[03:13:48] I're not notes, but I had all these
[03:13:51] pages of my life 500 and some odd and
[03:13:54] I had a couple you know
[03:13:56] I had reorganized it to kind of like the organization in the book and had a couple people like Frankie and Mike read it and they were like
[03:14:04] This is me like it. Yeah, that's that's me and so
[03:14:09] I said you you know you should make this a book and so you know I did the google and and you get these
[03:14:16] You get these assholes that'll take you for your money. So I lost about five grand with the with a fake ghost writer or whatever
[03:14:21] I was like man
[03:14:23] So finally I got a hold of um, you know my buddy said hey just google military authors and send him an email
[03:14:30] And I I can't remember how many but this lady named Lynn Vincent
[03:14:35] She's here in San Diego, but she contacted me back
[03:14:38] She said hey, you know I got I got a guy that
[03:14:40] Yeah, he take a look at it for you. So Mike Yorkie who's another San Diego guy
[03:14:44] I send it to him and he's you know he read it is like yeah this this needs to be a book and so Mike and I
[03:14:54] Painstakingly sentenced by sentence went back and forth over you know Florida to San Diego over the period of a year
[03:15:03] Create an a document descended the DOD for review
[03:15:07] DOD review went through
[03:15:09] good to go no no redactions and then
[03:15:12] Mike had a good buddy of his who's an agent named Greg Johnson and Greg he was able to
[03:15:21] Yeah, he sent the proposal to a chef book group and they were like yeah
[03:15:28] So that's that's basically what got that started
[03:15:32] I
[03:15:33] Yeah, I was I was in Afghanistan most of the time, but it's
[03:15:36] Yeah, I still I still couldn't believe it in the first time my I was in Afghanistan when my book released July 7th of this year
[03:15:46] And I remember this this this this kid came up to I call him a kid because you know
[03:15:51] I'm 42 and he's he's a young private and he said hey
[03:15:56] Can I ask you a question sir?
[03:15:57] It's like yeah, it goes did you well did you write a book and it's like now hiding right a book
[03:16:01] And he goes hi that's funny and he held a book and he goes because this kind of looks like he is like give me that book
[03:16:08] You're a son of a bitch, you know like I'm not here to promote a book
[03:16:11] I'm here to do a job and then I was like well, let me see that book and that's the first time I ever touched my book
[03:16:18] While you're on the ground in Afghanistan
[03:16:21] Yeah, so what's the future hole?
[03:16:24] Another deployment
[03:16:26] But my wife and I actually strangely enough we are going down the adoption route now. Oh right. Yep, so I eat he kind of
[03:16:34] Made it to where having kids is is gonna be an issue, but adoption is not
[03:16:39] So we're we're starting that whole process right now and it's
[03:16:43] Very murky
[03:16:45] So so we're but you know, we'll we'll get all that done and hopefully
[03:16:50] Within the next year, but we'll open up our home and give
[03:16:53] You know, give a little one a a great life. So that's yep, that's what we're going on and
[03:17:01] Yeah, I just I don't know. Oh, they're they're not just kind of living life and riding the lightning and and
[03:17:09] Slowly trying to try to build up people around me making up for years of
[03:17:13] Destructiveness so

[03:21:46] We don't want to worry about our joints while we're taking those beatings with our workout so it's part of life
[03:21:52] But we don't want to worry about that kind of stuff. So good news. Jockel fuel so we take our supplementation for our joints which is
[03:22:00] I'm just gonna start with this which is joint warfare super cruel oil

[03:22:07] So you don't have to worry about them also immunity right that's a big thing getting sick like these are things that like we don't want to have to
[03:22:14] Repon joints immunity so for immunity we got vitamin D
[03:22:21] Also cold war
[03:22:24] Take these yeah, you don't want to worry about a meaning definitely take these yes, sir also
[03:22:30] What do we got uh discipline supplementation kind of kind of like a not even really a supplementation
[03:22:36] But you want to go kind of lifestyle lifestyle kind of a lifestyle
[03:22:41] Laced and actually now that we're now that we're thinking about you know the way Ryan used the term lifestyle
[03:22:46] It could be use negative because I'm thinking now if you think about the life the joint warfare is a lifestyle
[03:22:52] Criollo oil super krill is a lifestyle yeah
[03:22:55] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you should make vitamin D a lifestyle that should be part of your life
[03:23:00] It's the way you live cold work the way you live
[03:23:03] Why would you why would you not do that there's not there's no reason to not be living this lifestyle
[03:23:10] There's zero reason is will make you better. Yeah. That's that same thing with the discipline
[03:23:15] Yeah, it's true. So discipline is one of those when you first came out with it. I was like cool
[03:23:22] Like cool. Oh, take it but you did something you didn't really understand that didn't really understand
[03:23:27] I am a full understanding at this time. I think
[03:23:31] So yes, that is a lifestyle so this one has three methodologies of deployment for lack of better way of putting it
[03:23:40] Boom discipline powder pre workout that's my I'm saying my little routine my little lifestyle if you will pre workout is the powder
[03:23:49] Discipline go the pills. I don't take
[03:23:51] Just don't have to you well, that's me because I'm going to talk and I need that little
[03:23:56] Different lifestyle. You will hit her but the discipline go cans energy drink. That's just like a
[03:24:06] Real energy that's like a treat. Look, I don't want to group this in with energy drink because we know what that means
[03:24:12] It's actually we know what that means. This isn't an energy it's real energy. I healthy energy
[03:24:16] It's definitely healthy. So we asked me the other day like on on the
[03:24:20] Social media platform. Is this healthy? Imagine being asked if it's healthy and I get to say yes, it is
[03:24:28] to actually healthy yeah
[03:24:29] Also, I'm sure you had that feeling like kind of like Tim Kennedy had when you asked him if he was allowed to shoot his guns in his backyard
[03:24:36] Oh, yeah, when you asked him that he's yeah, he's like I'm not even gonna justify that question with an answer
[03:24:40] It's kind of like that you kind of feel that only because you know though, but he was a thing that's a good question
[03:24:44] But all these are good question and also it's a good question because the chances that
[03:24:48] You go through the effort to make actually make something and spend the time in effort and money to make something that's
[03:24:56] Actually good for you the chances of that are rare. Yeah, but we did it did it this one go again
