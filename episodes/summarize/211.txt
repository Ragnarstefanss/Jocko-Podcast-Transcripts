When I like all read certain chapters, if I'm thinking of a very specific scenario going down for myself, you know, like if, you know, whatever the case means, this is not my scenario, but let's say you get into an argument with your coworker or something like this or your boss or your wife or whatever, even like with your kids or whatever. Like in a scenario with a coworker, you know, when you're in it, when you're not detaturated emotional, and you know, you say how to deal with that, where you're like, you know, take a deep breath, and you've got to recognize the signs and like all this stuff. Like, you know, like, demonstrating like how I'm like, you know, my, my initial response to that is to say yes. And then if you take that in a really mature way, which I lacked, but I was, I, this is, again, these are like, these like maneuvers that I barely made, you know, like when the Terminator responses popped up in my eyes when guys started, you know, getting a little bit more straight forward with me. I feel that way too, like, if someone's like, like, like, nope, you go, like straight up, nope, you go. So when you, when you were being all fired at, you know, Rambo, whatever, was there any like, superior, like a boss figure that was like, yeah, good job. That was kind of like, kind of like, yeah, and most of those guys were way older, like way older. So, you know, like, you get a new guy at work and he's working like extra hard doing the right thing. And yet they would always be like, Roger, you know, like that kind of like they disappointed me. And it's real obviously like, like, yeah, this person is trying to like show off how hard of a worker they are or show off this or that to get kind of recognition or attention or even respect or whatever. And then they want to go the extra mile, but in this real overt way in this real spectacular way, you know, like in your case, you're like running with these, you're the only one running with your boots on everyone else's been. Or like you said in our conversation the other day when they get told they have a big ego, they actually see it as a positive thing like you're damn right. He's like, this is, this is the northeast, like a tiny, he's like, hey, you need to, uh, just slow it down my friend over there. Was there a part of your brain that was like, that you recognize like, I'm, I'm for real, like actively showing off right now. This is also good because as they unload all their ideas, you now know not only everything you know, you also know everything they know. Like, oh, because I would legit, I had an AC joint situation, so when I'm like lifting heavy overhead, it's like, it just didn't go. So you're like, like, what do you call when you chop it up, like, pretty, you just said the word in the next. Because it's like the words are like, well, this is what you're going through right now. That's the feeling I always got from Flynn was like, you know, Roger, or from life like, Roger. I'm the man, I'm awesome or whatever and you're like, hey, you have a big ego right and to them they're like, And you're always like, you know, usually conclude through something like, I got it, bro. But until then you know the deal man, we got to follow the rules, and believe and also what information that you want to know, it's not significant enough that it's going to matter. If it's seven, like we talked about on the last podcast, if it's seven times in every three years, is there any one that's walking around like, well, you know what? Like people just think, oh, like, oh, This podcast was, you know, I was saying, listen, if you're doing it right, you're winning a battle, and the other person doesn't even know that there was a battle going on. Maybe they even met something else, you know, and just like, are you saying, like, really listen? And basically, it's a, it's a lack of awareness of, like, hey, I'm actually like in an elevated position in this team, whatever, I'll make that mistake. I was like, hey, Dave, you know, like I'm an asshole and I have to basically muzzle that. You know what, since we are talking about telling, delivering the truth, I'm going to actually jump into this little section right here, which is called tactfully delivering the truth. And he's, I mean, imagine, you know what life's like now, but imagine when life was whatever a thing's better, right? You know, you know, like a dog, right? It's, yeah, it kind of feels like that too, like in sports, kind of the same deal where you get a new person who has not proven themselves at all. So I'm saying, hey, when the boss is doing like reasonable stuff borderline reasonable, right, or the things that you were talking about, I think it was on the last podcast. I remember seeing these young junior officers in the SEAL teams that like either they went through ROTC or they, the naval academy or whatever they came from, whatever they got to commission, but somewhere along that they like took leadership classes. Like old school, you mix up a nestle's quick and you're like, all this taste good right now. Because you know how like you're going to the supermarket, right? I never saw that look of like screw you, you know what, shut up, you don't know what you're talking about, never. Whereas maybe you're, you know, if I was a little bit more in the zone with them, I might be like, who's this guy thinking he is, right? You know, my boss is never going to tell me, you're going to let me do whatever I want. Just like, are you like, not only do you know what you knew. Of course, I have a big ego, like I just I'm recognizing my awesomeness like that's kind of the only way to see it. It's like, yeah, this is like, oh, I'm talking to the new guys.
