And he said, well, I talked to, you know, Sergeant Jones and, you know, it was impressive because he said, and, you know, I had total faith in him. Well, it's really infantry, but it's put trolling operations, raid ambushes, you know, those kinds of things that we're doing in S.L.F. You know, when I first got to S.L.F.G when I went in with my group, everybody did, I arrived with went to what they called the 1-0 School, the S.L.F.G team leader school. So, you know, it was go get, so we went out and you know, sure enough, it didn't take us long to find, you know, of a container or so of people. If I only have to go out six times and six months, I mean, I've got to get to deal, you know, the grunts are going out every day and fighting, you know, or doing something or being exposed. And it started over by the chemistry, you know, so then we get out, we run the firing range, you know, I'm, I wasn't expert marksman before ever, you know, went in. also jocquwaiti yes not forget about the jocquwaiti you know once you kind of deadlift all that way to whatever we tend to forget where you know how you got there so let's just not forget that and plus winter is here kind of sure So I found this Taekwondo place, you know, right off campus there, and I went in and I said, you know, I need to help him up a little bit. I mean, we're out here with people, you know, you know, bullets going everywhere. Yeah, so I went to FOP-1 at Fubi with a group of other people and when we got there, they grabbed everybody, but me and said, you know, you guys are going to one zero school. Whether you're American or indeed you've got to know where it is, you've got to know how to get there. So I jumped around behind the tree and, you know, we set off to clay moors, had a full of ledge, you know, a firefight going on, eventually had to work gunshilts and things and get extracted. If they, if they don't have masks, and now all of a sudden they're getting all of the the gas coming in, you know, it's hard for them to see the instrument panel to be able to fly, you know, what they came back in and they got us out. You know, a lot of times we would carry gas, we'd carry regular, you know, like a CS grenade. I mean, you got to know where you are on the ground because you know the topology. And, you know, ironically enough, that was very similar to what it was like, you know, when I came home and went to the Ranger Department and became a Ranger instructor. so all I've kind of disparaged that flavor a bit of you know I've been like well you know everything else is so great And then, you know, when we got in contact, you know, when I call for those targets, they put it right on them. No, you know, hall it because like if you drink even like a coffee scenario where you, you get to a point where you drink too many coffees and you're like, I don't feel good anymore. So when we get about the two mile point, you know, I, I told him, I said, sir, I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and turn around here and go back and take care of some things. I mean, if the bad guys are coming, he's gonna take them out and you know, demonstrate it out, you know, on several occasions with me, demonstrated it later on. But you know, because, you know, compared to the regular mission, I mean, this isn't a little brainer. And those younger guys, you know, they just, they just don't have this, not all of them of course, you know, we still get some guys that are great at it, but it's just a different time. You've got to look at that and say, even if you have the attitude of it will happen to someone else, when you've got green trace you're coming through your aircraft, that might change even my mind and start thinking, okay, probably not going to probably not going to make it through this. So you take over this, you take over this new team, you got barge well, which I'm sure you heard me talking about it with Tilt, but you know, he was when I was a young officer, I just got picked up for a commission and I went to Germany and he was the guy in charge over there. And you know, it went in things I talked about and you know, the stress book is that when your stress level gets really high, you lose your fine motor coordination. But I paid for it, you know, later on, you know, I actually got extracted and it realized I had pulled muscles in my shoulders. He's got an AK-47 slung over his shoulder and he's telling, you know, his aids and body guards, hey, if we get in trouble, you know, worry about me. And if he does okay, then, you know, he will take over the team and he'll start getting, you know, Sog missions.
