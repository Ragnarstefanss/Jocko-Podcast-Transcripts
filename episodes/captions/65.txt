[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast, number 65.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:13] The things they carried were largely determined by necessity.
[00:00:18] Among the necessities or near necessities were P38 can openers, pocket knives, heat tabs,
[00:00:25] wrist watches, dog tags, mosquito repellent, chewing gum, candy, cigarettes, salt tablets,
[00:00:31] packets of coolade, lighters, matches, sewing kits, military payment certificates,
[00:00:37] sea rations, and two or three canteens of water.
[00:00:43] Together, these items weighed between 12 and 18 pounds, depending on a man's habits
[00:00:48] or rate of metabolism.
[00:00:51] In Redobbins, who was a big man, carried extra rations.
[00:00:55] He was especially fond of canned peaches in heavy syrup over pound cake.
[00:01:02] Dave Jensen, who practiced field hygiene, carried a toothbrush, dental floss, and several
[00:01:08] hotel-sized bars of soap, he'd stolen on Aronor and Sydney, Australia.
[00:01:16] Red Lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers until he was shot in the head outside
[00:01:22] the village of Thape K in mid-April.
[00:01:26] By necessity, and because it was SOP, they all carried steel helmets that weighed five
[00:01:32] pounds, including the liner and camouflage cover.
[00:01:37] They carried the standard fatigue jackets and trousers.
[00:01:41] Very few, carried underwear.
[00:01:45] On their feet, they carried jungle boots, 2.1 pounds, and Dave Jensen carried three
[00:01:50] pairs of socks, and a can of doctor's skulls, foot powder, as a precaution against trench
[00:01:56] foot.
[00:01:59] Until he was shot, Ted Lavender carried six or seven ounces of premium dope, which for
[00:02:06] him was an necessity.
[00:02:11] Michel Sanders, the RTO, carried condoms, Norman Boucher, carried a diary, rat Kylie,
[00:02:17] carried comic books.
[00:02:20] Kayawa, a devout Baptist, carried an illustrated New Testament that had been presented
[00:02:26] to him by his father, who taught Sunday school in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
[00:02:33] His head was a hedge against bad times, however, Kayawa also carried his grandmother's trust,
[00:02:40] distrust of the white man.
[00:02:44] His grandfather's old hunting hatchet.
[00:02:50] Necessity dictated, because the land was mined in Booby trap, there was SOP for each man
[00:02:55] to carry a steel-centered nylon covered flack jacket, which weighed six point seven pounds,
[00:03:02] which on hot days seemed much heavier.
[00:03:06] Because you could die so quickly, each man carried at least one large compress bandage,
[00:03:11] usually in the helmet band for easy access.
[00:03:16] The nights were cold, and because the monsoon were wet, each carried a green plastic
[00:03:21] poncho that could be used as a raincoat or ground sheet, or makes shift 10.
[00:03:28] And it's quilted liner, the poncho weighed almost two pounds, but it was worth every ounce.
[00:03:35] In April, for instance, when Ted Lavender was shot, they used his poncho to wrap him
[00:03:42] up, then to carry him across the patty, then to lift him onto the chopper that took him away.
[00:03:56] And that excerpt is from a book called The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien.
[00:04:06] Then the book is about the Vietnam War, and it's actually a blend of non-fiction and fiction.
[00:04:16] And part of that blend comes from what he actually experienced for real, as a soldier in
[00:04:25] Vietnam, in third-platoon, alpha company, fifth-patallion, 46th Infantry Regiment.
[00:04:34] And incidentally, he was in the same division and the same area of operations where the
[00:04:40] Mi-Lai massacre took place.
[00:04:45] And then that reality is intermingled with his thoughts and ideas and stories that put together
[00:04:52] a unique perspective on war.
[00:04:59] But the book is considered fiction, and I don't like to dig too deep on fictional books.
[00:05:07] So I'm not going to go too deep on this one, but I was having a little conversation with
[00:05:12] my brother, Dave Babin, with whom I wrote a little book called Extreme Ownership.
[00:05:22] So, Dave and I were talking about the things that we carried.
[00:05:29] And tonight we have the good fortune of having my brother, Dave Babin, here with us again
[00:05:37] today.
[00:05:39] And I figured a good way to begin talking about what we carried was to kind of compare and
[00:05:47] contrast what we did carry with what men like Tim O'Brien carried in Vietnam.
[00:05:57] Dave Babin, my brother, welcome to the show for the third time.
[00:06:02] Thanks for having me on.
[00:06:03] You're going to be back on again.
[00:06:05] And for those of you that don't know who Dave is, if you haven't been listening or if
[00:06:10] this is basically the first time you've ever listened to this podcast for some reason,
[00:06:14] if you're not going to know, glauph is, life was in the sealed teams with me.
[00:06:19] We were in the battle or modded together.
[00:06:21] And when we both got out of the military, I retired and late, late, late, got out.
[00:06:27] And we ended up working together.
[00:06:28] We have a little business called National On Front.
[00:06:30] We're going to work with companies and teach leadership and management.
[00:06:33] And we wrote a little book like I just said, called Extreme Ownership.
[00:06:36] And actually, if you want to know about life, well, you can read Extreme Ownership.
[00:06:40] You can listen to podcast number 11 and podcast number 34.
[00:06:46] Laf was the first guest.
[00:06:49] And here he is back again.
[00:06:51] So, Laef Babin, what did you carry?
[00:06:57] Talk to me about that.
[00:06:59] Compared to what these guys in Vietnam carry.
[00:07:01] I mean, obviously there's a lot of similarities.
[00:07:03] There's a lot of differences too.
[00:07:05] What do you think?
[00:07:06] Definitely.
[00:07:07] I mean, it brings back so many memories just thinking about all the stuff that we
[00:07:10] carried with us and the burden of just the heavy.
[00:07:16] We used to joke about stuff, body armor back.
[00:07:18] The body armor just biting into your traps.
[00:07:21] I feel you've had it on for hours and hours of the helmets, just the vice down on your head.
[00:07:26] Obviously, we had a training prepared so that we could prepare to have those things on
[00:07:30] for hours and hours and be able to deal with that.
[00:07:33] And in fact, I remember you being the only guy in the universe that actually liked
[00:07:39] a certain type of headset that we were using because it actually crushed down on your
[00:07:43] skull and were like, bring it good.
[00:07:46] Everyone else is complaining about it.
[00:07:47] You're like, you're like, I actually like this.
[00:07:49] I think her at my head.
[00:07:51] I would never have admitted it back then.
[00:07:53] But yeah, it hurt bad.
[00:07:54] It would squeeze your head in that awkward way.
[00:07:56] And that was bad.
[00:07:57] That was a, that was a gnarly old headset.
[00:08:00] But a lot heavier because the body armor, where were we?
[00:08:04] How much did our body armor weigh?
[00:08:06] There's like seven pounds of plate and you got a front and back plate and then you got
[00:08:10] the nine mil body armor.
[00:08:12] And that right there is heavy.
[00:08:15] And then the funny thing is we were able to make our weapons a little bit later over time,
[00:08:18] but then we've decked them all out with lasers and optics and everything.
[00:08:21] So the weapons, I bet your weapons were actually heavier.
[00:08:23] Definitely.
[00:08:24] And then like for me, we had trained to carry those little 10 inch barrel.
[00:08:29] We have an M4 of the 10 inch barrel which we use for close quarters combat, house clearance.
[00:08:34] And as you know, that was like the primary weapon and we get to our body.
[00:08:38] I was like, I got to carry my 14 inch barrel which is longer and it's got an M2O3 grenade launcher
[00:08:43] on it.
[00:08:44] So you got a 40 millimeter grenade and that's what becomes, comes a lot heavier based on that.
[00:08:48] I just, I needed that to be able to throw some 40 mic mic down.
[00:08:52] Now one of the things that I know was, I mean, we all going to lock in combat and actually
[00:08:58] Andy Stump was just on and I know your friends with him too, but we were talking about the
[00:09:02] learning curve of how quickly you learn things.
[00:09:05] And I know you learn some pretty solid and rough lessons out of the gate going on to
[00:09:12] big patrols, right, right, right when we got there.
[00:09:15] And specifically about what you carried.
[00:09:18] Absolutely.
[00:09:19] I mean, we had to focus so much on doing a roll up a salt.
[00:09:24] We're a loadup in vehicles.
[00:09:25] So you're not, you don't have to carry much on your person because we're trying to
[00:09:31] drive up in vehicles.
[00:09:32] And so we get to Ramaday and of course we've done our patrols out the desert, done that
[00:09:36] that training and prepared for that.
[00:09:38] But we think we're going to Iraq and we're going to drive in vehicles and we get to
[00:09:41] Ramaday and these IDs are so dangerous and killing people.
[00:09:46] So what do you do?
[00:09:47] You get out of the vehicle and you patrol, which means if you're going into an area and
[00:09:50] you've got to carry everything on your back and you've got to carry enough water and
[00:09:53] all the stuff you've got to have for the next 24 or even 48 hours, it's a lot of stuff.
[00:09:59] And one of the first patrols, I've done a few patrols on the Altskirts of town, but that
[00:10:05] city center where it was Alkhaida control battle space and US troops were dying almost
[00:10:12] every day in this horrible violent place.
[00:10:15] We've been on the ground for a couple weeks and we were teaming up with a marineat
[00:10:21] from 38 marines, third batai and eight marines, outstanding group of warriors who've been
[00:10:27] on a ground for a month or two prior to us getting there and they were these guys were in
[00:10:31] the thick of the fight and they were they had adjusted their tactics and learned how to go
[00:10:36] out there and and conduct these patrols as we were teaming up with them to go into an
[00:10:40] area called firecracker circle.
[00:10:42] As firecracker is in, hey, this is a happy place with 4th of July or firecracker is in massive
[00:10:48] bombs.
[00:10:49] As in there's a 400 pound explosive in the road that's going to blow your vehicle 100 feet
[00:10:53] in the air and kill everybody.
[00:10:54] That was that area firecracker they did not as a matter of fact when we even even later
[00:11:00] than this when you were looking at doing operations in there and I remember sitting there with
[00:11:04] the marines going hey what's the QRF situation who can come in to get us and they were like
[00:11:07] hey look we're not coming in there with vehicles unless they're like hey if it's an absolute
[00:11:14] worst case scenario and you got to get somebody to cast a fact immediately but if you get a
[00:11:18] guy get shot in the leg and you can stop the bleeding you're going to wait till my time
[00:11:22] you they were adamant about not going in there because it was so bad I mean they patrolled
[00:11:26] in there all the time which you're about to talk about but nobody wanted to bring vehicles
[00:11:29] up in those streets and actually part of that reason is because just before we got there they
[00:11:33] took a massive eye the Marine Corps took a massive eye to hit it and I think they lost four
[00:11:37] five marines in one shot just just a total of travel.
[00:11:40] That was right as we were arriving here in the stores about that and reading reports on it
[00:11:44] and horrible horrible deal but that was a great tactic that we learned from the marines
[00:11:49] which is listen the bad guys they want to blow you up in the streets they're going to try to
[00:11:53] target your vehicles they're going to try to ambush you so when you're in a building in a sniper
[00:11:57] over watch position and you're behind concrete walls like stay in that position stay in that position
[00:12:03] unless you have an urgent surgical casually you've got to get out right now or you're going
[00:12:07] to be overrun only in extreme situations so we're not going to call in the QRF because they're
[00:12:12] going to blow the vehicles and that's what they want you to do and they taught us some of
[00:12:15] those things that we're that help keep our guys alive and certainly helped us perfect our our
[00:12:22] our tactics techniques and procedures to be able to go deep into those areas and and do some
[00:12:27] real damage to the enemy and most of the time bring our guys up. So speaking of going deep how
[00:12:32] deep did you have to dig on that first patrol out with three eight Marines so we're going into this
[00:12:36] area I mean we you know these marines are just lost guys and we were going in with a lemma company
[00:12:40] outstanding group of warriors and and you know we were excited to go in and work with them so I've
[00:12:46] got to you know we got about a squad of seals going in we got some Iraqi soldiers and we're going
[00:12:50] to team up and we're going to put in some mutually supporting sniper over watch positions and remain
[00:12:55] you know through through that we're going in night time we'd remain through the day and we come out
[00:13:00] the next night so I'm like hey I'm going in there we may be in there for twenty four to could even be
[00:13:04] longer if we get delayed and you know what this is a bad era nobody can come come get us out
[00:13:09] so I'm load now for World War three and you know my first time going in these areas I mean I'm
[00:13:16] packing hand grenades and extra mags and you know our tip collowed out was two hand grenades and I
[00:13:22] think I added a I added like three or five extra hand grenades that I was bringing and so I put
[00:13:27] that my back I'm bringing I've got you know my tip I was actually laughing about this because we've
[00:13:32] done a lot talking about World War One and they had grenade battles like like trench to trench
[00:13:38] grenade battles and I don't even think if I was going into our grenade battle when that was my
[00:13:43] primary weapon I would have seven grenades like life was carried right into Ramadi bring it
[00:13:49] it's awesome so I'm getting I'm getting ready I'm getting ready to get some and you know I'm thinking
[00:13:53] that if we're getting overrun and we're loading up on it so it's like one more thing one more thing
[00:13:58] you know extra mag here extra mag there so you know I've got I've got those extra hand grenades
[00:14:03] I've got the extra a smoke grenades I've got you know I've got flash bang grenades I've got I've got you know
[00:14:10] four five extra magazines in addition to like the seven magazines and each of these are 30
[00:14:15] round magazines we can you must have a hundred miles you can't at least raise them crazy amount of and
[00:14:20] then of course I've got my I'm carrying my 40 mic mic right so I've got 40 millimeter grenades as well
[00:14:24] and and I was typically you know I'm loading that out so so I've got a band allure of 12 with
[00:14:29] those things I think I had six more on me in in a pouch on my waist so literally I'm rolling in like
[00:14:37] John J Rambo style ready to get some so that this is your see you know as I'm sitting here
[00:14:42] thing that must have been a hundred pounds worth of gear with your body armor all those grenades
[00:14:46] smoke grenades 40 mic mic you must have had at least close to a hundred pounds I think I think
[00:14:53] easy because then you tack on water you know that was the biggest limiting factor for us I mean you know and you got the
[00:14:59] summer time heat over there just just unbearable you know may hit a hundred fifteen hundred twenty degrees
[00:15:05] and so here we are remain over day you're not gonna drink the water out of the faucet you know unless you want to be
[00:15:11] unless you want to be visiting make it some frequent head calls and having some disintera for the next
[00:15:18] next few days and what that's gonna bring you so so you got to get a care of that water in you know
[00:15:23] we carry this leader and a half bottles that they had I think I had probably ten or twelve of those
[00:15:28] bottles too so I'm like I don't want to run out of water so I'm gonna be able to watch more
[00:15:31] you know that even thought I needed so ridiculous amount of weight that I'm carried and so we load
[00:15:36] up I mean I'm having a hard time even just you know picking this bag up put it in so we load
[00:15:40] up in our vehicles we drive we meet up with the Marines we're loading up into their big seven ton
[00:15:44] trucks that they took in and they put the troops in the back these huge vehicles and that that was
[00:15:49] they would kind of drive you on the outskirts of the bad areas on roads they cleared and hopefully
[00:15:54] you were protecting and you know in those in those vehicles from from the armor then we unloaded
[00:15:59] and we unloaded from the vehicles once we got to a point and just so everyone knows these are like
[00:16:03] madmax scenario vehicles that people that that people military guys had had put
[00:16:09] steel on the sides you know half in steel on the sides to protect from rounds sandbags on the floor
[00:16:16] you know just put sandbags all over the floor so it's not like when when when he's talking
[00:16:20] about an armored vehicle don't think of a tank through or a Bradley fighting vehicle he's talking
[00:16:24] about a madmax scenario big giant seven ton truck that it looks like a construction truck
[00:16:30] basically but it's got big steel walls on it and now they put sandbags on the floor to prevent
[00:16:35] from IDs and that's going to war in the fun way straight straight out of the road warrior
[00:16:43] stuff and so we get dropped off from those vehicles and of course we're getting up and you know as
[00:16:47] soon as I'm putting this thing on like man I'm carried I can't wait to drink this water you know
[00:16:52] I can't wait to try to shoot some of these rounds you know get to get rid of some of this
[00:16:56] weight because I realize like it's it's crazy it's crazy man of course you're like you know
[00:17:00] you don't want to run an ammo but you also you know you can't if you can't move then then it
[00:17:05] becomes even more dangerous so we started patrol and we're moving in the area and and and the
[00:17:09] Marines who who'd spent the time on the granite I talked about me there they're method of patrol
[00:17:14] because there were a lot of enemy snipers out there and even though it's nighttime you know there's
[00:17:17] still some street lights and things like that so the method of patrol is two man shooter pairs
[00:17:22] and there those guys got each other's backs you got two guys covered two different directions
[00:17:26] and they're holding on on a on a street corner and and then they're waiting for the the next
[00:17:33] shooter pair that's up to the next block from them and they sprint all out mad dash sprint
[00:17:40] it's fast as you can go as fast as you can run from one corner to the next one so it's it's
[00:17:44] it's a hundred moon but it's a cover in sprint as exactly and some of those blocks maybe it's
[00:17:49] 50R some of them it's a hundred yards but you know and this is how they patrol into the city so it's
[00:17:54] it is you you're your sprint hold sprint hold sprint hold and you know a few blocks are going into
[00:18:00] that and we're kind of moving around the city and the misdirections like man I am smoke I'm having
[00:18:04] so hard time keep it up and just my hat these these young Marines that are just getting after
[00:18:09] it carrying heavy heavy equipment and gear and the radio man and the guy carrying his you know
[00:18:15] his 40 mic mic and there of course they're carrying the two 240 Bravo machine gun which is
[00:18:20] a belt for machine gun that that was much heavier than what what I you know more at
[00:18:24] Forty-eight slider machine guns were for our meeting machine guns but these guys were just awesome just awesome
[00:18:31] trying to you know trying to work with them but I am I am having one hell of a time trying to keep
[00:18:36] up with these guys so what does that do to your it's a do to your leadership capability when
[00:18:41] you're you're I'm tired you're I'm supposed to be in charge of this thing so I'm in charge of this
[00:18:47] I'm in charge of my guys you know we got a squad of eight of our guys eight seals and you know
[00:18:51] it does in our acy soldiers so and I'm supposed to be a charge I'm supposed to be thinking about
[00:18:57] the bigger picture and be able to attach and all the things that we talk about sitting back and
[00:19:00] thinking about you know what's going on you know half mile up the road and making you know
[00:19:05] a radio calls back to the the tactical operations center talking to you and telling you where we are and
[00:19:09] what's going on and I can't I'm focused at this point on putting one foot in front of the other just
[00:19:15] head down one foot in front of the other and just try to keep up you know and here I am the
[00:19:19] guy just having a hard time keeping up and it was it was humbling humbling experience for me here I am
[00:19:26] a seal a team guy thinking I'm in shape and you know and I'm in an area where you know I'm not a
[00:19:31] climate us to this kind of brutal heat even at nighttime it's 95 degrees outside you know and there's
[00:19:38] no wind no wind and and you think oh it's a dry heat in the desert no the rivers like you know just
[00:19:44] it's not a dry heat yeah we're not in the water right yeah we were half you know half my
[00:19:48] whole off the river so it's it's humid along the river so it was it was horrible and I was
[00:19:54] realizing like this I got my ass kicked I mean it was by the time we got back from that it was I
[00:20:00] knew I was going into a heavy like heat exhaust like I was I was hitting the like the heat exhaust
[00:20:05] in point where it was like this is rough this is rough and that's the thing that's scary about
[00:20:10] heat exhaustion scenarios is it's like a cliff you're walking off of and when you're getting close to
[00:20:15] the cliff and when you go off of it it's not like you say okay let me get a sip of water no
[00:20:19] you're in big trouble you got guys carrying you now because you you know if you get the heat stroke
[00:20:23] or heat exhaust and it's a bad bad situation and it doesn't matter how tough you are you're not
[00:20:28] going to be able to power through that right physically uh and so that's what you know that's the
[00:20:33] nightmare scenario for me that here I am the leader and yet if I can't keep up it's going to
[00:20:36] have to carry me right that was that was just going to be a horrific disaster so you know we
[00:20:42] went to that operation we were out there for you know a remain throughout the course that the the
[00:20:46] the daylight we got shot at we shot at some bad guys and and then we came out you know the next night
[00:20:52] and I got back from that I'll re-aggressively returning fire to get some of those rounds we definitely
[00:20:57] grew up to return fire unfortunately didn't get a chance to throw any of the hangar neds
[00:21:01] round which was a real bummer but yeah I mean it was it was a real rude awakening for me just
[00:21:08] being humble by that experience to come back and think I'm carrying way too much stuff I can't you
[00:21:14] know it's it's sure I don't want to run out of ammo you know in it but but how much more dangerous
[00:21:20] isn't for me to be carrying so much stuff that I can't even keep up on a patrol I can't move
[00:21:24] fast when I need to and if bad guys start shooting at us I can't get my guys off the street you know
[00:21:29] or I can't move run across the street or run up the stairs and and so I recognize right away like
[00:21:34] I've got to I got to pair this down and I got to carry just the essential stuff and maybe
[00:21:39] a couple of contingency plants like maybe I got one extra grenade in my backpack and maybe I don't
[00:21:45] even need that you know what do I really absolutely need you know don't want to run out of water
[00:21:50] out there so maybe I got one extra bottle don't need four you know with me and and that enable me like
[00:21:56] to to recognize that I've got to carry only the essential stuff because you can absolutely get
[00:22:01] overwhelmed and part of that too if you're you know we were training we trained at land warfare at
[00:22:07] the time you know what was the attitude was we do land warfare in the seal teams so we don't we don't
[00:22:13] we're helmet and body armor for land warfare so we'll go out and patrol across the desert and do
[00:22:17] that stuff we were helmet body armor when we do CQC close quarters combat in the in the kill house
[00:22:23] and you know here we are in an urban environment like got to gotta be able to do both I'm
[00:22:28] full patrolling and then we're clearing houses so gotta have that stuff and and just recognize how
[00:22:33] you just cannot carry all that stuff with you so that was the route away came from me and the
[00:22:37] other piece of that was physical training you know here I was thinking I'm in shape I'm a team guy
[00:22:42] you know we train hard we push the envelope and yet I am not in good enough shape to be able to
[00:22:48] perform at the level I need to in this kind of heat in this kind of environment you know and after that
[00:22:53] you know you would see not I was in less and not just me learn but I saw it's so many of you know
[00:22:57] it's you bruise or you showed up if you showed up at like noon if I heat of the day you see guys
[00:23:03] out doing tire flips doing doing you know sprints running working out to get a climate ties to be
[00:23:10] ready for those those worst case scenarios and we recognize that we thought we were good and we
[00:23:14] had to step it up to it to and even I actually took one of those workouts and I would do it at
[00:23:20] victory MMA training fighters but the workout was it was a dummy carry because we had a big
[00:23:27] old heavy bag so it was a dummy carry carry it down and back sprinters hard as you can then grab the
[00:23:33] tire it was a tire pulled down and back and then a sprint down and back and what that was simulating
[00:23:37] was like okay you might have to pick up a guy and carry him down or carry him somewhere then you
[00:23:40] all you also might have to grab a guy and drag him and then you might just have to sprint but that
[00:23:45] was we do that like you said we do that stuff at high noon because because like you said everyone
[00:23:49] want to be acclimated for the worst case scenario and that was something we saw over and over again
[00:23:53] even the by the way I remember you running those I remember you running Dean through that
[00:23:57] uh do that training it was brutal I was like that too much did it that's rough that's a rough thing
[00:24:03] good training awesome training you know it prepare you for those worst case scenarios but we it was
[00:24:08] humbling we'd see you know we'd have great team guys brothers who showed up you know in
[00:24:12] the body and want to go out and patrol with us guys who we knew were incredibly fit
[00:24:17] great athletes kept themselves in shape these certainly weren't the guys that let themselves go
[00:24:22] and we take them out and patrol and like they'd be falling back you know they'd be having a hard time
[00:24:25] keep up they'd have they had to learn that same lesson that I learned and then you'd see him after
[00:24:30] getting after it like training and pushing the envelope and I think that was a lesson that you know
[00:24:36] we learned some great taxes from Marines and also got I was my hats off for those young Marines
[00:24:40] that were that were getting out there in the thick of it they taught me some some some great lessons
[00:24:44] there that enabled us to go forward and and really push you know push the envelope go in
[00:24:50] deep in areas that nobody could get into and set up the sniper over watches and help
[00:24:54] and protect the soldier Marines that were building those combat outposts but we had to be physically
[00:24:59] fit and we had to carry only the essential gear that we needed you know what's interesting
[00:25:04] I'm sitting over here because we didn't you know obviously we're in a business consulting business
[00:25:09] but same thing that we'll see with businesses when they want to they want to do the same thing
[00:25:17] they want to build their infrastructure so much that they can handle any scenario that's going
[00:25:21] to happen so they're going to hire three more people in case of this and they'll hire six more
[00:25:25] people for that and they'll hire four more people for that for that contingency right it's like
[00:25:30] you saying well I might run out of magazine so I'm going to put five more of my backpack and I might
[00:25:34] throw these four grenades so I need three more and the next thing you know these companies they're
[00:25:38] so overburdened with with overhead and with cost structure that the same thing happens what
[00:25:44] happens they lose their ability to maneuver and so it's the same thing you take that combat
[00:25:49] principle of carry what you need think about it and don't carry too much and you can apply
[00:25:55] that to the business world if you don't need to bring that extra person on board and you can
[00:26:00] get away with a contract for a little while you can pay somebody some overtime do that until you
[00:26:05] have to make that decision and you'll know so that's something you actually taught me in in
[00:26:11] Ramadi you know we you can't you had been in Baghdad and had those good the experiences of these
[00:26:16] capture kill raids and it always seemed like where we're going in this house we don't know what's in
[00:26:22] that house we know we believe a bad guy to be there and maybe yes people so so I'm going to put
[00:26:26] 25 assaulters in that house and you know I'm gonna put as many people as I can and then you're like hey
[00:26:32] late I don't think you need that many people and initially I was like that's crazy why we're
[00:26:35] not going to take them all and then you're recognized like 25 people in the house there's a lot more
[00:26:40] mayhem there's a lot more chaos there's people bumping into each other and you're like yeah maybe
[00:26:44] maybe 14 guys is all I need you know for this particular day yes what else um when you're on this
[00:26:49] target where's the biggest threat the biggest threat actually oftentimes isn't in the building
[00:26:55] you're taking down because you're doing that aggressively you have a good force the the harder threat
[00:26:59] to cut you know where the threat is a building is you know 480 square feet or 1,400 square feet
[00:27:05] you know how big that puts it it's a it's a finite area whereas when you're in the street
[00:27:10] 360 degrees that threats there so where do you actually need people to cover a threat that you
[00:27:16] don't know and don't understand you need them in the streets that's where you need them and that's
[00:27:21] where we always went heavy on the streets and at the assault team is a smaller package and plus
[00:27:25] it's very easy and very controlled to be able to say jocco I need four more guys in here boom you
[00:27:31] got him super is doing the opposite hey send four guys out in the street we don't know where but
[00:27:36] send guys out it's it's totally it's much more hard it's much harder to do that because it's a
[00:27:40] much less controlled situation out in the streets and I think for leaders that planning piece right
[00:27:45] to think about where is that contingency what what are the life of the contingencies that may
[00:27:49] happen so yeah keep that essential personnel essential resources and focus you can't plan for
[00:27:55] every contingency and if you do you're going to overwhelm your team and it's going to it's going to
[00:28:00] cause more problems trying to solve every contingency than then it wouldn't otherwise yeah
[00:28:07] all right that's good stuff you know what I'm doing go back to the book right now
[00:28:14] here we go they were called legs or grunts to carry something was to hump it
[00:28:26] as when lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps
[00:28:33] almost everyone humped photographs in his wallet lieutenant cross carry two photographs of Martha
[00:28:41] as a first lieutenant and platoon leader Jimmy Cross carried a compass map code books
[00:28:49] binoculars and a 45 caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded he carried a strobe
[00:28:57] light and the responsibility for the lives of his men as an RTO Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC 25
[00:29:07] radio a killer 26 pounds with its battery as a medic rat Kylie carried a canvis satchel filled with
[00:29:16] morphine and plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the things a
[00:29:22] medic must carry including mnms for especially bad wounds for a total weight of nearly 18 pounds
[00:29:28] as a big man therefore a machine gunner Henry Dobb Dobbins carried the m60 which weighed 23
[00:29:41] pounds unloaded but which was almost always loaded in addition Dobbins carried between 10
[00:29:48] 15 pounds of ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders they all carried ghosts
[00:30:00] when dark came they would move out single file across the meadows and pattys to their ambush
[00:30:06] coordinates where they would quietly set up the claymores and lie down and spend the night
[00:30:12] waiting in that section when I was reading that clearly this is very similar to the
[00:30:25] operations that you conducted a ton of which was they're called a manborses here and we call
[00:30:30] them sniper overwatches but the idea you know the idea for those of what was happening is very
[00:30:38] very similar you know you guys are patrolling out to a location just like you talked about
[00:30:44] setting up for remain over day or for the night how did you feel like you know you kind of
[00:30:51] talked about it but did you feel like you were ready for that stuff and you know a lot of times
[00:30:59] like you said we were we were we trained to drive a lot then we ended up walking so much
[00:31:06] because the idea threat how did you manage that once you got on the ground well I think thank God
[00:31:12] we had actually trained and you know it's been a part of the seal teams it's Vietnam you know going
[00:31:17] out in the southern California desert and training in you know land warfare you know is that
[00:31:21] that awesome block where you go out and learn how to patrol which we talked you know you talked
[00:31:26] a lot about the podcast and started we talked about with that song front and you know where it's
[00:31:30] man camp out in the southern California desert in this rugged environment with just sharp rocks
[00:31:35] and and you practice with spines and rattlesnakes so so real quick everybody in the world will
[00:31:43] may hear the term southern California they think of Baywatch right yeah they think of Baywatch
[00:31:50] we talking about Baywatch so when you go east from the coast in southern California you enter
[00:31:57] a place places that have names like death valley right those are the kind of areas we're talking
[00:32:02] about we're not talking about so cow Baywatch we're talking about inland in the deserts the hard
[00:32:12] deserts of California and that's where it's one of the primary places where we trained for
[00:32:17] for combat and it is I always used to say that our desert training facility is where men
[00:32:23] become frog men even though there's no water out there it's where men become frogmen because
[00:32:28] it'll test you no doubt and I you know thank god that we we get tested like that put you know that
[00:32:33] that kind of training is something that's kept seals alive on the battlefield and able
[00:32:38] us to to accomplish some some great things for a long time and I remember that first shake out
[00:32:43] patrol you know that was a good one the land war for instructors we're fired up a gap in the
[00:32:47] desert to train get our land war for on dial it in our procedures and learn how to work together
[00:32:53] there's a team and patrol and we show up to the camp it was funny because generally I mean I'm
[00:33:03] not going to say that you have this immense trust with the cadre but like you know we're kind
[00:33:11] of friends with like these guys we know them and so they did a really good job of of suckering
[00:33:16] us in on that on that first patrol because they said hey we're just going to send you guys
[00:33:21] out on a shake out patrol tonight and so a shake out patrol in the sealed teams means you're going
[00:33:27] to put your gear on you want to see how everything rides on your body you want to make sure
[00:33:32] that it's comfortable you want to make sure that there's no you know tags that are wearing on you
[00:33:37] or anything like that that's just a shake out patrol get your little hand signals make sure
[00:33:40] we're all good to go get to know each other a little bit it's just like a little it's basically
[00:33:44] like a little walk like like a little walk I mean if they think it's probably going to take a
[00:33:48] shake out patrol should probably take you know hour maybe two hours at the most we're just going to be
[00:33:52] you know kind of relaxed mode doing a little shake out patrol and that was the setup and it's
[00:33:57] administrative right so you're like hey let's work on this it's that so it's not like you're
[00:34:01] you're in the game acting like you're in the enemy territory the whole time and you know so
[00:34:05] you're kind of talking with instructors and figuring things out so yeah so they're like oh yeah just
[00:34:10] the the the lamb weren't for cadre like yeah just just a little shake out patrol and they'll be
[00:34:14] doing so we're just showing up you know no one's got there I know I didn't have my gear stitch I
[00:34:19] grabbed some stuff that I had from advanced training it what we call SQT so a walk I was
[00:34:24] getting to training from from like two years before that and I had these two canteens that had been
[00:34:31] filled with water in that gear and I don't think I emptied that water in like two years so there's
[00:34:39] probably a little algae growth and some massive is going on in these canteens so I just like don't
[00:34:44] want to shake out patrol you know and then we were rushed because they were like hey we got to
[00:34:47] get this going we got to get this going so we arrived you know guys are trying to get settled and like
[00:34:51] hey get you know get your gear on let's get over there let's it's so so we throw our gear on and
[00:34:56] I throw on that gear with those canteens you know there's this two year old water in it and we're
[00:35:02] and we go we take off in the patrol and what we didn't know was that this shake out patrol was
[00:35:09] uh was a was a man test it was a man test and what what were we like using the sealed teems called
[00:35:14] the mud suck which is basically a sucker punch right they they put together a patrol that was
[00:35:20] it took hours and hours it took the whole night the whole circle of darkness so hold that
[00:35:26] and and no one had I mean several guys didn't have any water I remember I remember a Ryan Joe
[00:35:32] had like no water at all and I remember him like you know just struggle was like hey uh sir do you
[00:35:40] have do you have some water and I actually came up I came up to you I think because you said no one
[00:35:46] had water and actually I had water I had water I was going on to me it was like shake out patrol
[00:35:53] of course even though I was like oh it's kind of administrative of course in my mind I'm like hey
[00:35:56] it's a shake out patrol but I'm doing everything the way I would do it normally because I'm super
[00:36:00] hardcore so I got all my stuff the way it's supposed in and also I had the advantage of having
[00:36:05] done a lot of these trips in my time so for me I didn't it wasn't trying anything new it wasn't
[00:36:10] shake out patrol from here it's just a patrol but yeah I went got good water my canteens my
[00:36:14] camel back and I was all good to go and I was ready for this and because this will make those
[00:36:19] freedom give you your you had the freedom to go out and execute with your water uh meanwhile I'm
[00:36:24] carrying these canteens that I know like I did you say you're like your first sip you spit it out
[00:36:28] I actually I actually I got so thirsty right that finally I was like I got it I got to drink
[00:36:34] something and so I I I pulled one of these canteens out again you know it's just nasty I opened it up
[00:36:42] I like smell it was like made it smells like a it smells like a fish aquarium you know
[00:36:46] and I like just but at this point I'm desperate right I'm just we're like two or three
[00:36:50] four hours into this thing I'm gonna sweat so I was like I take a big sip in this thing and
[00:36:55] it just immediately projectile vomit that up that stuff back up and I I think I gave one of those
[00:37:03] canteens to to rise is so this desperate but I asked you for water how that word did I ask you
[00:37:09] for water I was like hey jocco do you have any water and I was like yes that was like yes I do
[00:37:16] and you said keep I can you he's your voice was scratching me to hold my yard you were dehydrated
[00:37:20] you're like can you give some of that to Ryan he's eating bring any water and I said something
[00:37:25] along the lines of well firstly I said no you can't have any of my water if if you want water you
[00:37:31] must hump it in you don't I don't hump in your water and I'm not humping in Ryan's water that
[00:37:36] doesn't work this way you bring in your own water and then I this I think I said like if he's going
[00:37:42] to die I will give you some water if he's not going to die you'll get nothing and he got nothing
[00:37:50] so and it just everybody says like it is it is pretty if you can't carry your own stuff in right
[00:37:56] it's pretty to boot to boot to have to like depend on somebody else and no kidding at that point
[00:38:02] we didn't actually know I didn't know how long we're gonna be in the field for I mean we
[00:38:07] didn't keep it in the dark they didn't care if we were going on and they did a really good job
[00:38:11] of they brought us into the hill into the hills of southern California where you're going to
[00:38:17] be going up and down terrain and the terrain is uneven and they did this whole link up drill so
[00:38:21] it wasn't like we were just blindly walking it was link up from starting with swim pairs and then
[00:38:26] fire team link up and then squad link up and then platoon link up and yeah so the future was very
[00:38:32] unknown at this time so I wasn't you know thinking hey I'll just give a bunch of my water away
[00:38:38] because you give a lot of money you got nothing and then you're struggling to keep up too so
[00:38:43] it's it was a bad situation and it was it was a hassle I think I might just have like peaked a
[00:38:48] little bit at least getting in the zone it was definitely border like but look I think the
[00:38:54] reality was you were helping reinforce the lesson that you got to have your gear square to
[00:38:59] away you got to be ready for a contingency like that because that happened all the time to us you
[00:39:04] know where we like hey this is going to be you know obviously we're in Ramadi and we're like hey
[00:39:08] this is gonna be a 24 hour operation like no now it's a 48 hour operation now it turns
[00:39:12] into 72 hour operation we're gonna we're gonna stay here longer than we thought so you got to have
[00:39:18] you got to be square to be thinking about that and you know thank god we had such awesome amazing
[00:39:24] leaders like like Tony a fratty you know there's been on this podcast and that people love
[00:39:28] and which is why we can say his name because otherwise we'd name off all the other guys that were
[00:39:33] out there good you know the LPO's that get after it the E5 mafia in there running things so yeah
[00:39:40] so it's the whole crew and that's exactly and just leaders at every level that were stepping
[00:39:45] up leading their fire teams leading their squad and I think that was the thing god I appreciate
[00:39:50] is as as as much as that sucked and as much as people were complaining about that at the time
[00:39:56] those kind of training scenarios where we didn't see it coming and it was a lot harder than we thought
[00:40:00] it was gonna be it got us ready you know to to for those those long range patrols in Ramadi and
[00:40:06] when we got there like you said we thought we all thought we're gonna drive and they were like we
[00:40:10] can't drive man as the best way to get killed if you don't try to drive into some of these areas so
[00:40:14] park your vehicles and walk in on foot and again we you know we learned we only had to carry the
[00:40:21] essential stuff but we also know we had to carry some firepower too because one of the things
[00:40:24] that we did in Ramadi was you know I think oftentimes special operators can get little spoiled where
[00:40:30] you know if you're going out on a mission and it's got some higher profile and you've got you know
[00:40:34] you've got aircraft supporting you and and you know you're gonna have all this you've got
[00:40:39] close air support set up where it's it's just dedicated to you you know and here we are we're you know
[00:40:44] we we had 40 seals and tasking at Roosers I'm leading a 16-man seal button and maybe a couple
[00:40:49] other augments you know with seals and our UD bomb disposal technicians and our Racky soldiers
[00:40:55] and we're just one tiny unit out of 5,600 troops that Marines and soldiers of the first brigade
[00:41:01] first armored division brigade combat team so there isn't dedicated aircraft to us you know there
[00:41:07] is an QRF that's a quick reaction for us that's dedicated just to us to come out.
[00:41:12] Yeah because on top of you you know we had our unit and just because you were out with your
[00:41:17] platoon in a firefight you were not the only game in town at that time there would be three or
[00:41:24] four other units somewhere else on the battlefield that were in a firefight maybe worse maybe
[00:41:28] not as bad but there was there was always someone that's called the QRF or that needs air support
[00:41:35] so it was exactly like you're saying we we weren't at the top of some food chain we were just
[00:41:40] in the in the food chain and had to learn how to mitigate that stuff by so so you know that
[00:41:46] massive loadout that you took and you were heavy you it's not like you said okay I'm not going
[00:41:50] to have to carry this stuff anymore you still had to bring it we had to make sure that that we
[00:41:55] carried our own firepower into those areas when in an area where we knew that the tanks may have a
[00:42:00] hard time getting in there to us even if even the emergency scenario and we didn't want to be
[00:42:05] overrun you know 50 enemy fires trying to overrun our position and we only had you know eight or 10 or
[00:42:10] 12 12 guys in this position with you know some Iraqi soldiers who were pretty much worthless
[00:42:14] when it came to to beating back an enemy attack like that so and then and by the way there were
[00:42:22] many positions the small positions snipers size elements that were overrun and dispend
[00:42:29] you know before we showed up there was an element that disappeared and they they found their
[00:42:33] bodies months later but you know same thing it was a smaller element of I don't know as five or six
[00:42:38] guys in a sniper type element they got overrun they didn't know no knew what happened to them
[00:42:43] and it happened to large fortified positions as well if you remember some of the checkpoints that
[00:42:48] were well fortified and built up and they got completely overrun by by by mouch and so yes my
[00:42:56] driving a big thousand pound VBID truck bomb in their position horrible we had to carry all kinds
[00:43:02] that fire power with us we had to carry on our back so the belt fed machine goes guys carrying
[00:43:06] those those the machine goes we're gonna beat back enemy attacks Carl Gustaf was was our shoulder fire
[00:43:13] right to recoil is 84 millimeter recoil is rifle it we use and it's heavy super heavy
[00:43:19] it's great against enemy tanks the the mouch didn't have any tanks so it was probably a lot
[00:43:28] heavier than what we needed our our leading petty officer would just man up BTF and carry that
[00:43:34] thing in and he figured out pretty quick though that I think the first time he tried to carry it in
[00:43:39] he's he would they were on a long range foot patrol and going in to an area that was this there
[00:43:44] was a rural area a little bit outside the city and so now you know we were used to patrol in the
[00:43:50] city streets in this rural area mc1 that was kind of out east of of Romadi now you're talking
[00:43:56] about patrolling in through farm fields and flooded flooded areas where you might be an ankle or
[00:44:02] knee deep mud it looked like Vietnam it looked like every every warm movie that you see about Vietnam
[00:44:08] in fact we used to call it the Vietnam the Iran that's what we call it and it was it was just like
[00:44:14] that I mean my first patrol that I went on out there were literally waiting through
[00:44:19] irrigated fields through mud and and waiting through canals because there's all these little
[00:44:23] canals are coming off the river to irrigate the fields and there was some marine support and so
[00:44:28] we had we had a Huey helicopter and a cobra gun ship which are Vietnam error platforms and I was like
[00:44:35] man am I right right there or Vietnam this is great there was there were people out till in the
[00:44:39] the fields with like a like an ox I mean it looked like something straight out of it was it was
[00:44:45] actually crazy out there and everyone how much it looked like Vietnam it was not it was nuts and it
[00:44:50] was not anything that we'd expected to do certainly so we just had to prepare for that
[00:44:54] contingency and and figure out a way to you know to operate in that environment and but you know our
[00:45:00] IPO is carrying that you know carrying that big man rocket but he recognized right away like
[00:45:06] initially he tried to carry some rounds in his backpack and you know each of I don't even know
[00:45:10] what this thing was but it's it's gotta be what it's gotta be I think the weapon itself probably weighs
[00:45:17] 25 25 pounds and each of the rounds because he got a way down to 10 to 12 pounds yeah and maybe 15
[00:45:23] pounds I don't know but so when you put that thing when you load that thing initially carried it
[00:45:29] and loaded and then put around his backpack and it just weighed him down he couldn't do it so
[00:45:34] you know it's hard keeping up so I recognize I'm gonna carry it empty I'll carry it in my hand
[00:45:38] I'll put one round of my back why could I can use and then we'll put another I always cared around
[00:45:43] for in my in my rock sack as well you know that I can hand off to those gunners if they needed it
[00:45:47] but that gave us some firepower to be able to to beat back an enemy attack and we had to carry
[00:45:52] that stuff in on herself so just it took you know one or two guys that could man up and and do that and
[00:45:56] our LPO was was the guy to beat you up with that yeah and you said if you needed it and you needed a lot
[00:46:01] because um you know I don't know if you remember this but you guys shot the six month load out of
[00:46:07] Carl Gustav rounds in about a week and a half so and then we had to borrow a bunch from the
[00:46:12] Rangers and we actually shot their load out too so it was awesome we actually got the cool Airburst
[00:46:17] rounds with the Rangers which was awesome yeah those are those are effective what does that mean
[00:46:22] Airburst Airburst means that it explodes over the top of so that guys are shooting at you
[00:46:28] from a rooftop right like and and they're hide my hand a wall you could like you can you can
[00:46:34] you can determine like how far they are and set a timer on there so it explodes over the top of
[00:46:39] them so it's pretty devastating it's pretty awesome we like they have a standing yeah
[00:46:44] T.T. Brisser got after with some Carl G rounds yeah that's kind of advanced though you know
[00:46:48] like technology wise where you can set how far you wanted to it is advanced it throws
[00:46:53] another kind of twist and you know you gotta yeah it's good to go I didn't like I didn't know
[00:46:58] it was like that well they have actually had airburst rounds for a really long time
[00:47:02] well we don't hear about them though yeah you know I mean I know it's a little advanced in
[00:47:06] the civilian sector I guess yeah it's pretty dope though that's good stuff alright I'm gonna go back to
[00:47:12] the book here taking turns they carried the big PRC 77 scramble or radio and interestingly
[00:47:22] if you remember when Andy Stumpf was just on we were talking about being new guys in the
[00:47:26] seal teams in the 90s we were still carrying the PRC 77 in our training operations which is pretty
[00:47:32] crazy we carried it butts there we did that for our our comps shots of us taking turns they
[00:47:38] carried the big PRC 77 scramble or radio which weighed 30 pounds with its battery they shared the
[00:47:45] weight of memory they took up what others could no longer bear often they carried each other
[00:47:54] the wounded or weak they carried infections they carried chest sets basket balls
[00:48:01] Vietnamese English dictionaries in Sydney as a rank bronze stars and purple hearts plastic
[00:48:07] cards imprinted with the code of conduct they carried diseases among them malaria and dysentery
[00:48:15] they carried lice and ringworm and leaches and patty algae and various rocks and molds
[00:48:25] they carried the land itself Vietnam the place the soil a powdery orange red dust that covered
[00:48:35] their boots and fatigues and faces they carried the sky the whole atmosphere they carried it
[00:48:45] the humidity the monsoons the stink of fungus and decay all of it they carried gravity
[00:48:54] what a great description coming that's just and that's why like I said even though this book
[00:49:04] is you know part fiction in a blend of truth and fiction that clearly is written by someone
[00:49:10] that was on the ground in Vietnam and there's a lot of similarities between that
[00:49:17] environment and the land itself and the atmosphere in Ramadi what do you think of when you
[00:49:26] think of the atmosphere in the land in Ramadi just listen to that and it just takes me right
[00:49:30] right back there you know to oh some no one could have been able to write that unless they'd been
[00:49:35] there you know unless they'd been a part of that and you know what that was like for us and
[00:49:41] the first thing I remember about about being in Ramadi is just the the stench you know there's something
[00:49:47] there's always the stench of something burning always the stench of something burning and whether
[00:49:52] it was civilians burning trash because there's no trash pick up in this total war zone city and
[00:49:57] you see these giant trash piles everywhere and so certainly there's the stench of that garbage all the
[00:50:02] time and but so they be burning trash and a lot of the burning was a burning vehicle in the street
[00:50:09] they got I did you know that was an explosion that went off that was that was a building that was
[00:50:14] on fire because the tanks hit it with a main gun round and you know or the bad guys had driven
[00:50:21] a truck bomb into the opposition and just just smoke in the air and I remember that that stench
[00:50:27] of burning and I remember the stench of the trash the garbage and and sewage raw sewage that was always
[00:50:35] a stench as well and I kind of takes me back there and the kind of he's in the air that you get
[00:50:40] I kind of Iraqi he's it's kind of like all those smells that you talk about it's kind of like
[00:50:46] war is hanging in the air because it's fire and it's gunpowder and it's trash and it's like that smell
[00:50:54] is war in my mind if I smelled that smell I'd think we're at war right now
[00:50:58] that sometimes if you know sometimes you'll smell a similar smell or things like that I was
[00:51:05] just kind of taking me right back to to be in that environment yeah those the stench I think is
[00:51:11] of that but it was it was also a stench that we loved as well because you know this is what we
[00:51:18] dreamed about our whole life and I remember Tony and I talking about that you know just just
[00:51:23] this is where we wanted to be right I mean every people in T. bruiser our our boys were ready
[00:51:29] to get after it and be a part of that and you know where else we want to want to be that in that
[00:51:36] incredibly difficult environment you know this most dangerous battlefield and we we wanted to be a
[00:51:42] part of that so it was that it was it's stonk but it was it was it was it was it was it was it
[00:51:46] right remember the first thing it was first big operation we did in the moolab and I'm rolling
[00:51:52] in there and it's it's dark and we kind of turned this main corner and as soon as we turn this
[00:51:57] main corner there's there's tires in the street on fire and you know so you I could smell it before
[00:52:04] but I was like what's that well am I smelling burning tires and bruiser enough we turned the
[00:52:07] corner and it screws up your night vision goggles because now they're getting all blood out by the
[00:52:11] bright light and and then as the sun's coming up a little bit you see the dark smoke and
[00:52:18] I remember that to me I don't know why but that to me was the switch in my mind because
[00:52:24] because there's that was the first because in my first big operation that was the first thing
[00:52:29] that I said to myself those are the bad guys though the bad guys did that they're here they were
[00:52:36] just there you know it's like my first moment of saying that and it's also very distracting and
[00:52:41] hard to see and all that other stuff and and I remember when I was running training and we would do
[00:52:46] mounts and areas my one of my big things you know I say all right guys how many tires you can put
[00:52:50] out the burn and and I remember one time someone's like you know what I'm gonna do the tires tonight
[00:52:55] and I said no we're doing the tires tonight always set tires on fire let that be known
[00:53:01] because it screws things up and I think it was just my own personal desire to be taken back to
[00:53:10] that place like you were just talking about well I remember those mounts and areas going out
[00:53:13] there with you you know you're running that training when I was at you know when I was at
[00:53:17] operations officer and executive officer at the sealed team and it took me right back there
[00:53:21] and to me the smell that you know the the stench would hear the the call the prayer you know
[00:53:26] comes out you'd see the graffiti walls and it was it was it was so much like that and it was awesome
[00:53:32] you know it was awesome you know it was a great vision on out in our when we really got after
[00:53:37] it with the mount training facility and really did everything we could dissimulate what the guys
[00:53:41] were gonna experience man you couldn't you couldn't tell actually you could you if you if you
[00:53:45] you got transplanted you wouldn't be because we did the even the because in Ramadi all the
[00:53:50] electrical wires were all knocked down so we'd string these crazy wires up just randomly in our
[00:53:56] in the streets to make it look because guess what you'd be running it could caught up in this
[00:54:00] wire and you got to make sure it's not an IED so you can't just pull you know it's all these
[00:54:04] little things to simulate as best you can but thank god you didn't have the rivers of Ross who
[00:54:10] is running to the streets so I'm trying to want to allow our guys to slip and fall down into
[00:54:15] or to just horrible I had one of my first deployment this guy was walking and I don't know what this
[00:54:20] was but we were just walking in all of a sudden he walked and he fell through it was like there
[00:54:27] was a hardened shell and he fell through this hardened shell right into a sewage pit and
[00:54:33] all of the or because all of I don't know what the shell was made of but it was we know it was
[00:54:39] under it it was nasty there was a big metal pipe across across you remember we called it shit
[00:54:46] creek that was actually the official name on the map because it was literally like a creek of
[00:54:50] raw sewage and there was a big metal pipe and we often patrol across this pipe you know it was
[00:54:55] the one where you did not have to jump it you got actually just walk across and later actually
[00:55:01] uh some of the army you guys had burned the grass out there and there were there were IEDs all
[00:55:05] around we didn't even know we're there when we first patroled in but one guy was with us he slipped
[00:55:10] off the pipe and fell into the fell into a shit creek which and now you know he's he's got to
[00:55:17] be in that uniform for the next stuff it's only a 48 hour operation no doubt no shower no shower
[00:55:23] for good 24 48 hours that's good to have so I think the one thing missing too from you know from
[00:55:30] uh that we couldn't recreate in that in that mountain area that you were running it was it was
[00:55:34] so awesome but the just the heat like the the heat was overwhelming and I think that's that's what
[00:55:40] really got guys even guys that were in really good shape you who were you know great athletes
[00:55:46] if you weren't a climate ties to that did it just didn't matter until you really got a climate ties
[00:55:52] it would crush you and I remember that going in you know even like I said at night time it's still
[00:55:57] like 95 degrees outside and you know when the sun's coming up there'd be a little bit of breeze
[00:56:01] kind of the early morning you get a little bit of coolness and we're talking it's like high 90s right
[00:56:07] but you know it's gonna hit 117 you know for the high that day and you're sitting on the rooftop
[00:56:12] and my my rucksack is still covered with tar where you know the the tar starts creeping out of the
[00:56:19] rooftop and just melting into your bag and sticking on your weapon and your gear and your uniforms now
[00:56:26] I sweat a lot like I I'm a sweat I sweat a lot as a person I remember but I remember one time
[00:56:32] and it wasn't when we did cop falcon the first time but it wasn't when they had air conditioning
[00:56:36] in there yet it was like in one of those inter between ops and I was down there you guys went out
[00:56:40] you guys were working and I was in there cop falcon and and I had come down in a Bradley or
[00:56:45] in a Humvee Bradley's or a Humvee their whole hot but but then I got in the building and I was
[00:56:51] coordinating with you know the the company commander and I'm sitting there and now I'm not doing
[00:56:57] now I haven't been doing anything physical in fact I I think I was inside with with my gear off just
[00:57:02] with my body armor but I'm just sitting there and and I'm sitting there like looking at a battle map
[00:57:08] and it's just me no one's with me I'm just looking at the battle map I think I'm trying to talk
[00:57:12] to you you're probably heading out in the city and you're going somewhere and I'm looking at where you are
[00:57:15] and there is a stream of sweat I'm not doing anything I'm just literally sitting looking at
[00:57:21] a map and there is a of sweat coming off of my nose onto the onto the battle map and I thought to
[00:57:26] place myself bro it's hot here well and you were in the shade then and no this was this was at
[00:57:34] night you had a night like we came down at night you guys inserted and I was just sitting there
[00:57:39] so I've been sitting there for a minute and that's one thing that I always know this is the hottest
[00:57:43] time of day in the desert is when the sun goes down I don't know if this is a true physics thing
[00:57:49] if you're a scientist and you want to come back at me with the facts maybe I'm wrong but let me
[00:57:53] tell you what it feels like and I say this the heat comes out of the ground so all that sun's been
[00:57:59] beaten down the ground all day the heat comes out of the ground and then the wind stops and so it's
[00:58:05] just that is the hottest time it's true here in the southern California desert and it was true when
[00:58:09] I racked that the hottest few hours was after the sun goes down like the next two to three hours is
[00:58:15] the worst absolutely brutal on on that that same operation I remember we were we were running
[00:58:20] on a water because we know we were out we had moved out 300 you know 300 yards or so down the street
[00:58:26] and set up in that big four story apartment building and we were running on a water so we had to do
[00:58:32] so I remember we're doing a daytime I was like we got a couple guys we had a stretcher
[00:58:36] we had a foldable like Israeli stretcher that we we opened up and me and and through
[00:58:41] other guys are sprinting down the street because we know there's snipers out here I mean we're right
[00:58:46] and they you know we're outside the perimeter and we're running back to where you were at the
[00:58:50] copfalk and and we loaded up a bunch of case of water and there's worries and then we're sprinting back
[00:58:55] and I remember getting back from that you know and that we did that like it's probably like two
[00:58:58] o'clock in the afternoon and it's literally like 117, 120 degrees and I was of course we had our gear on
[00:59:04] and we did we're doing this 300 yards for that Karen a stretcher that probably weighs like 150 pounds
[00:59:09] we were bringing enough water for like 20 guys and it you know and food and it was I don't
[00:59:15] think I I mean I look like I just got out of the shower for just sweating and all your gear and
[00:59:21] a lot of our eyebrow you know there was the requirement you had to wear eyebrow eye protection
[00:59:26] so either like ballistic glasses or and on what guys said we were in previously was the goggles
[00:59:31] that you wear to protect your eyes you couldn't wear it because if you had it on it would be
[00:59:36] completely fogged up and you couldn't see 10 feet in front of you and I was like okay I can
[00:59:40] protect my eyes or I can like get shot and kill their trip over something not be able to get
[00:59:44] ready to go and you yeah because you would be completely blended by the the fog and nothing
[00:59:51] where we try to get the high speed once with like the little same thing it's you know talk
[00:59:55] what's about high tech here's some high tech we got these goggles that had to be miniature fans
[01:00:01] in them the blow fresh air in there they just suck it all everything sucks nothing works
[01:00:07] like windshield like personally that's what you need something that was another little
[01:00:11] TBR team bruiser saying everything sucks nothing works you know because someone is like hey man
[01:00:17] hey you know this this thing's not working I get everything sucks nothing works deal with it you
[01:00:21] know everything sucks nothing works next we know that it's a given everything sucks nothing works
[01:00:27] BTF BTF BTF BTF and it's actually we talked about the heat but you know we didn't talk about
[01:00:32] is the damn moon dust because you know he's talking about their then orange red dust the moon
[01:00:39] dust and Ramadi was nasty and gnarly and it was everywhere I remember it's specifically
[01:00:46] Craig and Orr was completely covered which was the the camp on the eastern side of Ramadi
[01:00:51] where the first the 506 was there and then we had a detachment of seals there and when you'd go
[01:00:57] over there it was just it was totally every step you took there was a pfff even trails that were
[01:01:03] getting walked on all day to the head or to the chow haul even those trails that were walked
[01:01:07] on every single day every it didn't matter every time you took a step there's a little cloud burst
[01:01:12] of this moon dust this fine fine moon dust that covered everything anyways all over the city too
[01:01:18] it was like talcobatter and it was you know those tanks would come in they crunch up the concrete
[01:01:22] so even if it was even if it had been previously paved now you're gonna you got you got sand you
[01:01:28] know dirt and and and it just I remember it getting in everything so we put park our vehicles I
[01:01:34] remember it particular to combat was grant you know riding the part of just south central
[01:01:38] Ramadi and it was patrone out of there you're in like knee deep moon dust so you know now and and
[01:01:45] that we're patrone out into a cypher over watch position moving out nighttime and not always
[01:01:48] it dusty and getting all over stuff it gets in your weapons and and you know you have to
[01:01:52] constantly clean them and and but I remember we get to where we were going you know get into
[01:01:58] a watch position and you don't have to take your boots off and just dump out like a pound of sand
[01:02:04] of that moon dust that got inside your boots that it got in through the little holes in your
[01:02:09] little tiny tiny holes on your jungle what is moon dust that just it does that happen yeah
[01:02:14] it's this fine fine fine it's like life's that it's like talcobatter but it's dirt it's some kind of
[01:02:21] fine fine sand again I'm sure there's some scientists that's gonna say that what it specifically is
[01:02:26] but far as I'm concerned it's moon dust and it's working for this is it we're not talking about like
[01:02:30] uh at on the beach you know in Hawaii we talk and then this is like you if you walk through
[01:02:35] this stuff it's all over you it gets everywhere there's literally walking through it and there's
[01:02:39] like a cloud of dust coming from you it's so fine oh yeah when it's getting there would drive by
[01:02:44] it's getting there would drive by it's getting there would drive by it's getting there would drive by
[01:02:46] or something it'd be just a jibis walking and you you're just breathing this moon dust in
[01:02:50] and it's and it's it's below your nose and it's just always like it's the color of the moon
[01:02:55] dust is weird yeah like when you um you right dirt bikes or something in a more of a dry area
[01:03:02] I mean obviously I'm sure it's way worse and you know in a reminder but same thing when you breathe
[01:03:07] yeah and just dirt you breathe it in your cough it's gonna be everywhere yeah below your nose just that
[01:03:13] just how it is over there just it was all just everywhere good times
[01:03:17] I'm taking this back to the book they moved like mules by daylight they took sniper fire at
[01:03:27] night they were mortored but it was not battle it was just the endless march village to village
[01:03:34] without purpose nothing one or lost they marched for the sake of the march they plotted along
[01:03:43] slowly, dumbling, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking all blood and bone, simple grunts,
[01:03:50] soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down into the patties and across the rivers
[01:03:57] and up and down again just pumping one step and then the next and then another but no
[01:04:04] volition no will because it was automatic it was anatomy and the war was entirely a matter of
[01:04:13] posture and courage the hump was everything a kind of inertia a kind of emptiness,
[01:04:19] a doneness of desire and intellect and conscious and hope and human sensibility
[01:04:27] their principles were in their feet their calculations were biological they had no sense of
[01:04:35] strategy or mission they searched the villages without knowing what to look for not caring
[01:04:41] kicking over jars of rice frisking children and old men blowing tunnels sometimes settings fires
[01:04:47] and sometimes not then forming up and moving on to the next village then other villages where
[01:04:52] it would always be the same they carried their own lives the pressures were enormous
[01:05:03] in the heat of early afternoon they would remove their helmets and flat jackets walking bear
[01:05:10] which was dangerous but which helped ease the strain now that that section obviously
[01:05:22] paints something different than what we experienced because and you can see what he's talking
[01:05:28] about you know you've got soldiers that don't know what the mission is that don't understand
[01:05:32] what the strategy is and you know there's all kinds of books about Vietnam and and at the highest
[01:05:38] you know we talk about sometimes how maybe we didn't do a good job of telling people what the
[01:05:43] strategy was but at the highest levels in the Vietnam war there's confusion on what the strategy
[01:05:49] just so there's no way that some frontline grunt understands why he's clearing this village and
[01:05:56] not that village or why it's that village and not this village they just don't know so what is it
[01:05:59] become it becomes like they're just robots human robots moving forward and I think we were very
[01:06:10] fortunate to be in a situation where you know we had a better understanding and again we talk about
[01:06:16] this in the book we could have done a better job it should have done a better job of making sure
[01:06:20] that everybody understood more but there was an understanding there was that a minimum
[01:06:27] everybody understood at a minimum the evil that was there the evil that was there in Ramadi
[01:06:35] in Iraq that was torturing people raping people killing people trying to enslave people
[01:06:41] everybody understood that there was evil there and that's what we were fighting against
[01:06:46] trying to help this local populist who was completely at the mercy
[01:06:52] of this insurgent group which by the way had no mercy so I think we had that benefit for us
[01:07:02] but one thing that is completely unchanged is this talk of this strain the strain that is put
[01:07:13] on the soldiers on the ground and when you think back to the strain that you felt that your
[01:07:20] men felt what do you think of what do you think of when you think of the strain I can absolutely
[01:07:28] relate to that I mean it's it's the it's something you and I talked about right when we got home
[01:07:34] when we got home it was you called it the burden right when we got we got home and
[01:07:43] we didn't even recognize how powerful that was you know I'm never talking to you about it we were like
[01:07:47] we all the sudden we could relax like there weren't we're people trying to kill us right there
[01:07:53] there were when we arrived back from that deployment to Ramadi and we're back in San Diego
[01:07:58] and and you and just the recognition that it's not just from our personal like hey people are
[01:08:04] trying to kill me but like I no longer am carrying the burden of the decisions that I make and
[01:08:12] people's lives are on the line right that like at this moment right now and I want to make sure
[01:08:16] that I've thought through all the contenders you know are we ready you know for for these worst
[01:08:22] case scenarios have we have we planned you know have we rehearsed these things have we tried have we
[01:08:26] thought what the enemy might do how could they hit us where we had even for senior you know that
[01:08:30] that burden that you just carried all the time and and for me you know man after after Mark
[01:08:35] I killed and Ryan got wounded it was just you know four months in our deployment it was just this
[01:08:42] recognition like man we're that can happen at any time and I knew it could happen at any time
[01:08:47] but prior to that you know it wasn't that we got complacent or that but it but it was we've
[01:08:51] gotten away with so many times that you all you you start kind of kind of see like maybe we can
[01:08:56] make it through this thing you know without losing people as is and just going out there and
[01:09:03] you know as you've talked about you can just only get lucky so many times like with all that evil
[01:09:08] and all that horribleness out there that that it can happen at any time and and that's the
[01:09:15] strain that I think that I certainly I feel the for other guys felt when you see that your your
[01:09:19] brothers killed or wounded when you've had close calls and you recognize like just how how close
[01:09:29] we are to death at any time any time we're rolling out there that that is the strain it is a
[01:09:36] strain on you and it's something that we're on you and I think for me it was just always always
[01:09:44] worried about like just the and when you see the violence of it you know the the vehicle graveyard
[01:09:50] that we rolled out through every time we're driving out the gate and just the twisted
[01:09:54] hawks of metal that used to be a vehicle that carried men or women in them you know and those
[01:10:01] were U.S. troops that were either killed or horribly wounded that were in that vehicle that were destroyed
[01:10:07] or if you see an ID go off and there's a hundred foot fireball in the air and just
[01:10:11] frag the metal fragments raining down you know for hundreds of yards and all directions
[01:10:18] from something like that like just the power of that you know the the violence of machine gun fire
[01:10:22] that's coming in close to you and now I often describe it's just the you know I wrote about in the book
[01:10:27] the the biggest strongest guy you can imagine just smashing the wall with a hammer next to you
[01:10:32] as hard as you can on the edge from your head and it's from your head just throwing concrete
[01:10:36] fragments everywhere and there's and you know now it's seven to eight hundred rounds per minute
[01:10:43] of that coming in at you with a belt fit belt fit machine gun maybe there's multiple once you
[01:10:48] net you RPG rockets just this rocking explosion this rings your bell you know even if it's just
[01:10:54] just on the wall outside you know if one of those things hits the window and and and detonates
[01:10:59] on the bars on the window it's going to just frag everybody in the room it's going to be horribly
[01:11:04] wounded or killed so that that was a strain all the time and and I think the difference for us though is
[01:11:09] is the you know and and you know there isn't there were some certainly some guys and you
[01:11:15] talk about leadership that we learn right get the guys carrying those heavy machine guns the the
[01:11:18] belt fit machine guns and all the gear that with them and they're like man do I have to carry
[01:11:22] this thing you know as a leader we had to remind them why that was important you know they
[01:11:26] got that love hate relationship the machine gun or stay loved the shoot that machine gun and they're
[01:11:30] awesome at it they hate to carry the machine gun right it's a it's that love hate relationship and
[01:11:35] so when they're going in on a full patrol that's a you know a mile full you know mile and a half
[01:11:39] full patrol into a tough area in their care and all the heavyweight they get focused on that so you
[01:11:44] got you got to help them recognize like this is this is why you're such a critical part of the
[01:11:48] team and why we got to have these machine guns so you got to do you know as a leader or something
[01:11:52] we had to do all the time but I think for these guys in Vietnam they're you know they're driving
[01:11:57] or flying into an area but shown in Toneira that's it seems like they're seeing they're seeing
[01:12:01] new terrain all the time you know for us in Ramadi it was this tiny city that was it's like what
[01:12:07] three by three miles you know across you're talking about just the central central Ramadi piece of
[01:12:12] it very small and we're going into the same area is all the time you know jay street the jay block you know
[01:12:18] pop a ten you know these areas that going down baseline road and you know to 20th street in these
[01:12:24] areas that we we got to know and we understood you know where the the the the the bad guys are operating
[01:12:29] out of and we've been in so many of these buildings and we so then we had to have the we had to mix it
[01:12:33] up and not patrol down the same streets every time and try to come in and do some misdirection stuff
[01:12:37] but we got to know these areas and you know even though it was a small area you know these tanks
[01:12:43] might be less than a mile away from you maybe they're even a half a mile down the road you know
[01:12:48] in that environment if there's if there's you know 35 ID's that could destroy anyone of which could
[01:12:54] destroy the tank between you and them half a mile away they might as well be a hundred miles away
[01:13:00] doesn't matter so you know we had to plan for those continues we had to be ready but that it was a
[01:13:05] strange I certainly remember well and and I remember that conversation as I'm sure you do come
[01:13:09] back and and recognize them like well I didn't even realize how heavy that strange was until we
[01:13:15] got back and it was it was lifted you know it didn't it didn't happen right away it happened
[01:13:21] like we were at least I feel like we were conditioned it would be it would be like going to a planet
[01:13:29] where there was much much higher gravity and you don't even realize how much more weight you're
[01:13:34] carrying and then when we came home it wasn't like it instantly the gravity changed it was like
[01:13:38] it slowly and one day yeah for me it was about a month that I I obviously I woke up and instead of
[01:13:45] the first thought I had when I woke up of like what's gonna happen today what bad thing can happen
[01:13:51] today it was like I think the waves look good and I'm going surfing and did go from that thought
[01:13:58] process from like you said it's the horror of the of the imminent danger because like
[01:14:10] like you said you can only get lucky so many times and you go out day after day after day and you got
[01:14:17] watching guys all over my guys all over a body there's no possible way that they can make
[01:14:24] it through today without taking a casualty and then they and then they make it through that day I
[01:14:29] got five elements three elements five elements two elements all out on the battlefield the same
[01:14:34] time there's no way they're gonna make it through today without a casualty they make it through today
[01:14:39] and guess what you wake up the next day and now you're carrying that day and today
[01:14:45] so you make it through that day now you're carrying three days and that just built and built
[01:14:49] and every once in a while obviously we would take a casualty and maybe you get a little reset
[01:14:56] but you don't it's just there and it's there heavy all the time and what's really interesting about
[01:15:01] this is you might be thinking as life explain you explain you know those feelings and I was
[01:15:08] I'm talking about right now you might think that we were solid and worried and swed and panicking or
[01:15:16] but but I'm sitting here thinking about it we would and everybody in the in the task unit
[01:15:22] we were having fun we were laughing we would have conversations we make fun of each other we'd
[01:15:26] make fun of our friends we'd make fun of our boss we'd make fun of everybody we'd laugh we'd have a
[01:15:30] great time and the the the the strain even though there's there's you know fun and good times on
[01:15:39] top of it that strain is absolutely there and it stays there in the whole time and it just builds
[01:15:44] I think the big illustration for that to me was when an operation was going on right and vehicles
[01:15:51] were lined up like get you know the vehicles are lined up out on the we had this that main street you
[01:15:55] know outside of the the the the talk tactical operations center and you know where your office was and
[01:16:01] and I remember that that bond that we had an in task unit bruiser you know so often you get what the
[01:16:06] seals are doing their thing and you got the support personnel that are running the radios and the
[01:16:11] C.B.s that run the cabinet they just do different stuff and they don't you know what was so awesome
[01:16:16] about task in bruiser was like you lined those trucks up and we know we're going out you know we're
[01:16:19] going out at operation and and if you were weren't if you weren't coming on the op I know you would
[01:16:25] you would always be out there you know out there shaking everybody's hands and talking to him and
[01:16:29] and not in a way of like you know not in a way that there was more bit right but in a way of like
[01:16:34] just the respects and knowledge that any time we're going out like any one time there may be
[01:16:43] there may be any of these guys that are all now may not become a back from this they may be coming
[01:16:47] back in a body back and and that we had to be ready for that at all the time because it was almost a
[01:16:52] daily daily thing and I just not you know for for you and the the support personnel the
[01:16:58] comms guys you know our our our radio when that route there these aren't seals and they're
[01:17:01] but they're out there getting the radio is ready and helping us out people just come you know
[01:17:06] you know our our our operation specialist you know chief coming out there I remember all those
[01:17:11] guys just lined up shaking hands talking to people it was just that and for the few opposite you know
[01:17:16] that I didn't go on with another another another if we had something else going on and another
[01:17:20] you know it's going out with our guys on a different operation I'm not a part of the same thing like
[01:17:24] going out there talking those guys shaking their hands and knowing that like they may not be coming
[01:17:28] back from that and I think that was the biggest that was the biggest to me like illustration of
[01:17:33] like that strain and again we laughed we joke there wasn't there was nothing more bit we were
[01:17:38] telling jokes and laughing and kidding each other but but that was really there and I remember we got
[01:17:44] relieved you know by the next seal team tilting father came in and you know good good
[01:17:50] bros of mine that I'd serve with that because I'd come from tilting five and new those guys when
[01:17:56] they were going out to you know I knew what they were going out into you know and I just remember
[01:18:01] going out there for that goodbye to them and shaking their hands and talking them back because
[01:18:05] we knew exactly what they were going into and they're going to keep keeping it an effort
[01:18:09] there was one of the hard memories when those guys came and I was doing like the turnover brief
[01:18:15] to their whole troop and I was you know I had a sign I put a sign up and it was going through this
[01:18:21] and that and the other thing and I'm like okay you guys are going to take casualties and and
[01:18:29] like I never fought in a million years that somebody would be briefing me hey you guys are going to
[01:18:36] take casualties and I'm like oh you guys might hate dangerous it looks like you guys are going to take
[01:18:42] casualties that is what is going to happen and that might sound negative but that was the facts that
[01:18:48] it was a hundred percent true that they were going to take casualties and we knew it we knew it and
[01:18:53] that's what was so hard to shake their hand and tell them goodbye and good luck and and watch them
[01:19:00] roll out for the first time alone without us and know that could be tonight and could be tonight
[01:19:19] I'm new uh hit one hit another section right now
[01:19:24] this is talking about talking about the men again
[01:19:34] going to the book for the most part they carried themselves with poise
[01:19:42] a kind of dignity now and then however there were times of panic when they squealed or wanted
[01:19:50] to squeal but couldn't when they twitched and made moaning sounds and covered their heads and said
[01:19:55] dear Jesus and flopped around on the earth and fired their weapons blindly and cringed and
[01:20:00] sobbed and begged for the noise to stop and went wild and made stupid promises to themselves
[01:20:06] and to God and to their mothers and fathers hoping not to die
[01:20:11] and back to what we were just talking about
[01:20:24] to have guys and you know we did a podcast about a guy named Colonel DePique and his
[01:20:31] his book called Battle Studies and when he describes men and one of his key points is he saying
[01:20:41] that men are horrified and they're scared of death and that they have this just incredible
[01:20:54] obviously this underlying the will of self preservation right that's the that's the
[01:21:01] thing that fuels people and he just talks about this tiny percentage of men that will overcome
[01:21:09] that and they'll be brave and to think that we were lucky enough to serve with guys in our
[01:21:18] task unit and to see the next task unit come in and to see the soldiers and see the marines
[01:21:25] to overcome that strain on a daily basis that is absolutely one of the most humbling things
[01:21:36] that I think I will ever experience in my life that's what that's what courage all about you know
[01:21:43] I think just to to see guys you know that are just in the thick of the fight with bullets
[01:21:52] missing their heads by inches you know I remember our member on the rooftop of building 99 right
[01:22:01] on 20th street in the world we were getting hammered I mean enemy rounds coming in by hundreds
[01:22:06] and hundreds of rounds coming in shattered windows and I remember our EOD bomb disposal technician
[01:22:12] awesome awesome guys he's he's laying on the rooftop and there's armor piercing rounds coming
[01:22:17] through the roof punching through concrete wall you know that's just like three inches over his head
[01:22:24] and he's just laying there and and I remember crawling up there trying to figure out he's there
[01:22:28] by okay and he's like looking at me like thumbs up laughing about it and I'm just the humor of those
[01:22:32] guys right dealing with that and no one you know again that that could happen at any time but you know
[01:22:39] just seeing the guys guys like Mark Lear I just the most hilarious guy you could imagine just
[01:22:44] cracking jokes you know and singing the you know the cheeseball 80s tunes you know I am the warrior
[01:22:51] and and the us laughing about and talking about that stuff and just just that's how they dealt with you
[01:22:57] know and and but it just tremendous courage and you know not just our seals not just guys that
[01:23:02] that we were with those those Marines and the soldiers that we serve alongside and just
[01:23:07] watching those guys day in and day out you know who often didn't have as much control over what they were
[01:23:13] doing as we did you know down at the frontline level but just out there getting after it
[01:23:20] with a great attitude and you know nobody's fearless right nobody you know some people think
[01:23:25] oh the you know we get that question all the time right from business like well it's you know it's
[01:23:31] more models are you know fearful but you guys are fearless like no nobody's fearless like you
[01:23:36] you recognize how mortal you are and that can happen at time and yet you see these guys just
[01:23:41] just totally selfless you know courage or just incredible courage to overcome that and just amazing
[01:23:47] I mean that's that's really to me that is the that is the bright light you know that we brought back
[01:23:54] from you know from that conflict to see and witness that and just the tremendous human spirit
[01:23:59] that can overcome anything indeed we're gonna kind of wrap up this section right now with one
[01:24:10] last little piece of the book here and this is one of the guys named Lavender last name Lavender
[01:24:17] he gets killed and the lieutenant takes the blame himself he feels that that blame
[01:24:27] and part of it he kind of blames on his his thinking about his girl back home marthun he's
[01:24:35] thinking he wasn't doing everything he could do and what could he have done better and where did
[01:24:42] he let his guys down and what he could do different from now on and I'm going to the book
[01:24:49] he loved her but he hated her no more fantasies he told himself hence forth when he thought about
[01:25:01] martha it would be only to think that she belonged elsewhere he would shut down the day dreams this was
[01:25:10] not Mount Sebastian it was another world where there were no pretty poems or midterm exams a place
[01:25:18] where men died because of carelessness and gross stupidity Kayao was right boom down
[01:25:28] and you would dead never partly dead briefly in the rain lieutenant cross saw martha's gray eyes
[01:25:39] gazing back at him he understood it was very sad he thought the things men carried inside
[01:25:50] the things men did or felt they had to do he almost nodded at her but he didn't
[01:26:00] instead he went back to his maps he was now determined to perform his duties firmly and without negligence
[01:26:10] it wouldn't help Lavender he knew that but from this point on he would comport himself as an officer
[01:26:17] he would dispose of his good luck pebble swallow it maybe or use least drunk slingshot or just drop it
[01:26:26] along the trail on the march he would impose strict field discipline he would be careful to send
[01:26:35] out flanks security to prevent straggling or bunching up to keep his troops moving at the proper
[01:26:40] pace and at the proper interval he would insist on clean weapons he would confiscate the remainder
[01:26:47] of Lavender's dope later in the day perhaps he would call them men together and speak to them
[01:26:55] plainly he would accept the blame for what had happened to Ted Lavender he would be a man about it
[01:27:03] he would look them in the eyes keeping his chin level and he would issue new SOPs in a
[01:27:10] calm interpersonal tone of voice a lieutenant's voice leaving no room for argument or discussion
[01:27:21] commencing immediately he'd tell them they would no longer abandon equipment along the route of
[01:27:26] march they would police up their acts they would get their shit together and keep it together
[01:27:32] and maintain it neatly in a good working order he would not tolerate laxity he would show strength
[01:27:45] distancing himself
[01:27:47] so he falls back on what we fall back on all the time on discipline on standard operating procedures
[01:28:04] on maintaining everything in good working order and one of the things that you can see here in
[01:28:10] people we get this to is you'd think these guys from Vietnam of course they're going to be
[01:28:20] paying attention of course they're going to keep the weapon keeps you alive in a firefight
[01:28:23] of course you're going to keep your weapons clean but he has the leader he has to lead
[01:28:33] and I think that's a common misconception and we do talk about it all the time and just one of the
[01:28:38] most frequent questions I get asked like well you know in the sealed teams you've got everyone's
[01:28:43] motivated and in every one's focus and it's a life for death you know so they're going to stay
[01:28:47] sharp and they're going to fall a procedure no matter what and you know my my team's not like that
[01:28:51] in the business world or you know people I work with aren't like that and the best teams
[01:28:59] they only fall that procedure right because they've got leaders that are stepping up and making
[01:29:04] it happen and and look we have some amazing people in the sealed teams just like we have some
[01:29:09] amazing people in the military in army and marine units and other special operations units etc but
[01:29:17] even with life or death online people get complacent people start letting the ball drop
[01:29:22] not clean in their weapons when they need to or not fall in a procedure or let in their guard down
[01:29:27] because well we've done this operation it does in times and nothing bad's happened so
[01:29:31] nothing bad's gonna happen right that's it's like this common human emotion that you just
[01:29:36] make these assumptions and so the only way that units are going to stay focused and not have
[01:29:42] that happen when they've got good leaders they got a fire team leader in charge of his four
[01:29:46] guys to step up and make sure that his guys are squirt away and stay in focus they've got to
[01:29:50] you know they've got a squad leader making sure that his squad is squirt the LPO leading pet officers
[01:29:55] out there make sure that guys are dialed they're not cutting corners I mean I always saw that with
[01:29:59] guys you know we've been these type of Overwatch positions you got like some of them had like one
[01:30:03] stairwell in and out and someone's gonna watch that stairwell someone's got to have a weapon and
[01:30:08] look down that stairwell for 72 hours yeah and so you know hopefully we could rotate some guys out
[01:30:12] so it's not just the same guy but but even so if you're it's gonna be several hours you
[01:30:17] watching down that stairwell and it's boring as well right and guess what you're the only guy
[01:30:23] watching that stairwell and everyone else has got their backs to you so if you're not doing your
[01:30:27] job you're gonna get those people get shot in the back and yet if what happens hey we I've been
[01:30:32] here I've been on the stairwell we look man doesn't we don't this operation doesn't times or
[01:30:36] we've been in this building multiple times nobody's ever come up to stairs I've been sitting here
[01:30:41] for hours on in like hasn't happened so people will fall asleep people will stop paying attention
[01:30:47] and only if you've got good leaders who are gonna go check on that guy and make sure that he
[01:30:52] recognizes that listen everybody's dependent on you you know not only you're gonna get killed
[01:30:57] if someone slips up the stairs but the guys people are gonna get shot in the back and yet they
[01:31:00] were dependent on you to have their back and it requires those good leaders at every level
[01:31:04] stepping up and going and checking on that guy and if he is tired you can't say what rotating
[01:31:08] out put somebody else in there but it requires leadership at every level so even with life and
[01:31:13] death in a line people get complacent and this really goes to what you know you and I talk about
[01:31:17] all the time which is what does it really mean to take care of your people you know that year
[01:31:22] well I want to be liked you know so I don't want to be a real hard ass and I don't want to you
[01:31:27] know I don't want to like you know I don't want to push too hard in that direction or like
[01:31:32] if they cut this corner maybe it's not that big of a deal and obviously you can go too far
[01:31:36] in that direction right but you become the slave driver but but are you really taking care
[01:31:40] of your people if you're allowing them to cut some corners that they shouldn't be you know are
[01:31:45] to get complacent when they shouldn't be and the answer is no of course not you're setting them up
[01:31:50] for failure and so you as a leader have got to step up and make sure that you're you know the
[01:31:56] peers around you if you're not a leadership position it would certainly as a leader make sure
[01:32:00] that your team and those around you are toe in the line and fall in those standard operating
[01:32:04] procedures and and achieve in that high standard possible because that's what is going to
[01:32:09] allow them to stay alive on the battlefield and ultimately accomplish the mission and certainly
[01:32:14] dominated win on their battlefield anywhere you know in business and life yeah you can definitely see
[01:32:20] that all the things that lieutenant cross rattles off that he's going to now start imposing
[01:32:28] he's going to start taking care he thought he was taking care of his men before
[01:32:32] by by letting them have dirty weapons and not hound and move about that by letting them drop
[01:32:36] gear on the trail by not sending out flanks care because it's a pain in the ass he thought he was
[01:32:41] taking care of his guys and he got one of his guys killed and that is exactly the point
[01:32:48] when you're taking care of your people that means you're taking care of them that means you're
[01:32:52] holding the line you're holding the discipline and you're making sure that they are
[01:32:58] as safe as you can possibly make them while still a couple of them in the mission
[01:33:02] and that is the pretty much what we had for this book by the way again it's called Tim O'Brien,
[01:33:16] the name of the book is called The Things They Carried definitely a solid read and I would check it
[01:33:23] out and echo all of them have it up on the on the website and yeah I know for those of you
[01:33:29] they're going to combat me and say it was a fiction book so now you're going to start submitting
[01:33:34] to me every fiction war book that's ever been written I don't know there's some damn good ones
[01:33:39] out there and there's probably someone going to end up doing but yeah this is one of them
[01:33:43] that is and again it's it's it's fiction but clearly it's based on the experiences and
[01:33:50] it and and once again you can see that even though war evolves and war changes the fundamental
[01:34:00] the fundamentals of human nature in war don't really change I'm not in the fiction books I
[01:34:09] don't remember the last time I read a fiction book I'm going to read that book because that
[01:34:12] immediately resonated with me and puts me back in those just the sights and smells and the
[01:34:18] stuff that we carried and opens up so you know it's just I look I like forward to digging into it
[01:34:23] and some detail and you know that's the thing when when you are dealing with these books
[01:34:30] and you start to really really listen to them and read them there's just there's always so much more
[01:34:38] than then you get out of it the first time you go through it so that's why for me
[01:34:44] you know reading it and then going through it again and then sitting here and reading it and now
[01:34:50] when I put the headphones on and read it it's it definitely they definitely hit you and you get
[01:34:54] more out of them in my opinion no doubt there's something magical about putting the headphones on
[01:34:59] you know because you you had read a couple of those excerpts when we were talking about this over
[01:35:02] last couple of days and what the podcast is going to be about and it did not you know once
[01:35:07] sitting here listening to you read it with the headphones on it's like it takes me immediately
[01:35:12] back to her body thinking about the stuff that we you know the things that we carried with us
[01:35:16] and the moon dust that we've been told doing those smells and stenches and the heat and
[01:35:21] frankly I'm I'm pretty eager to go back and get some right now I'm ready to make it happen indeed
[01:35:26] and you know what we got to do is it's the same thing with with these other books with with our
[01:35:33] book and and I know you know we were kind of talking about this a little bit you know when you
[01:35:38] write a book you're confined in in some way to the structure of the book and to the length of the
[01:35:45] book and to the balance of the book and so you can't just drill down on some facet that might be
[01:35:54] it might not be totally pertinent to that particular way that it's laid out but what we're going
[01:36:00] to have to do is we're going to have to get next time you come on we got to do we got to do our
[01:36:06] own book we're going to do extreme ownership at least get it through a few chapters because
[01:36:12] because we we know the authors you know and we know that there's so much back behind those that
[01:36:17] it would be awesome to sit there and and kind of give a bunch of those you know a bunch of the
[01:36:22] backstory behind these things and and I think next time we got to we got to make that happen let's
[01:36:26] do it I like that idea there's there's so much there and it is even going back and review in the book
[01:36:32] you're thinking about these little things like oh we should have said that and obviously
[01:36:35] don't illustrate this you know the the point and we got to focus it but yeah there's a lot
[01:36:39] a lot behind that I mean I think about that blue on blues in area you know you know just an
[01:36:43] opening chapter you should have ownership and what that was about and all that went into that
[01:36:48] and yeah be great to talk about that and somebody do we'll have to get that next time now
[01:36:54] extreme ownership name of the book extreme ownership is also the name of something else that's about
[01:37:00] to happen may forth and fifth the master the extreme ownership master leadership conference I guess
[01:37:09] is that appropriate to call it a leadership conference I'm not sure I guess if you had to
[01:37:14] classify what it is then maybe we put in that category but to me the master stands by itself you know
[01:37:20] and I think the definitions that you know that we utilize a gathering together troops
[01:37:24] well take a careful war I guess that fits very probably so I I can't say I go into like big
[01:37:31] details about the master but I just I just mentioned it in case people are interested in getting
[01:37:39] better especially from a leadership perspective and really from a
[01:37:45] human potential you know getting to where you think you can get getting beyond where you can
[01:37:52] think you can get I don't talk too much about it so since you're here and you're sitting here
[01:37:58] what do you think what's what what did you what would like the highlights of the master because
[01:38:03] if we just did the first one last year in October 2017 I thought it was going to be cool 2016
[01:38:10] or sorry 2016 I what did I say 2017 oh yeah that hasn't happened yet I thought that the
[01:38:17] master would be cool you know what I mean I thought hey this is going to be cool like it's going to be cool we're
[01:38:21] going to you know meet a bunch of cool people and we're going to talk about all this cool stuff and
[01:38:25] and do our best to pass on information and give and receive information all that so I thought it was
[01:38:30] going to be cool but it was a lot better than cool it was it was it was it was it was it was it was
[01:38:34] freaking awesome and what were like some highlights for you when you think about it what are you
[01:38:40] excited about for New York what you know we talked to so many people all the time right and
[01:38:46] and awesome leaders you know from companies that we work with and different organizations out there
[01:38:51] and and it's just love love working these leaders love talking to them I think but the
[01:38:57] master was there was just something magical about that you know I remember we couldn't have even
[01:39:02] predicted that right I think I think you just came up with a new tag on come to the master it's magical
[01:39:07] you know come up with a new word I'm going to take some shit for that come to the we're going
[01:39:14] to call the magical monster maybe we need to cut that maybe cut so what was the reason what was magical
[01:39:22] about it look for me what was here's here's here's what coming off the stage we were talking
[01:39:30] about you know what are leaving people the idea of why you know they need to take advantage of
[01:39:35] every day the gift that's been given to them by those brave warriors that gave their lives so that
[01:39:42] they have the ability to pursue that you know and I remember coming on stage you gave you just came
[01:39:46] up gave me a big hug you're not a hugger I don't hug and I was actually not gonna take down
[01:39:53] it all I thought maybe something like that was coming I was getting ready I was getting ready to
[01:39:56] get ready to do it to sprawl but I remember just just that emotion of like this was an amazing event
[01:40:03] it was an amazing event I think what made it amazing was you know we were able to interact with so many
[01:40:10] people you know and so many people that were in the game and had the same goals the same
[01:40:18] drive exactly and from so many different walks of life you know we had some awesome we had some
[01:40:23] really high power you know senior executives from from some great companies to you know mid-level
[01:40:28] managers and front-line leaders that are just aspiring to take on greater ownership entrepreneurs you know
[01:40:34] the the military law enforcement firefighters paramedics I mean across the space some people that we
[01:40:42] couldn't even vision or imagine from you know from from volunteer you know nonprofit organizations
[01:40:47] and things like that and interacting with so many different people that are eager to learn to
[01:40:53] implement the the president was extremely ownership in their lives that was awesome for me and it
[01:40:58] was interesting to me some I hadn't even thought about is the fact that you know if we spent
[01:41:03] folks so many people had come up to me and said you know it was it was worth the price of
[01:41:06] admission alone just to meet other participants here and learn from them and learn from each other
[01:41:12] you know fellow troopers and it was it was just it was awesome to see that so for me you know all
[01:41:17] events we speak in events all the time and we we expect it great events and we work with great
[01:41:22] leaders but it it was the absolute best event of all time that I've ever been a part of best audience
[01:41:28] app you know and I'm so fired up to go back and it's gonna be it's gonna be that much better in
[01:41:33] New York right out it's gonna be there'll be a few the same folks that are gonna come in
[01:41:37] and attend that were there in San Diego and there'll be a whole new group of people you know who
[01:41:41] who couldn't come it it'll be even bigger and it's gonna be awesome one of the things that
[01:41:46] that was awesome for me and I know it was awesome for you too because we talked about it but
[01:41:49] the interaction that we had with everybody right and and I remember when we were kind of
[01:41:54] setting and planning the event that was one of the things where you know we were talking about this
[01:42:01] we had a hey we did this we could have this person we've that and finally out of this was like hey bro you
[01:42:06] know what we need to do we need to just be there no backstage no curtain nothing we need to meet
[01:42:14] and interact and answer questions and get in the game with everybody and that's exactly what we
[01:42:20] did like for instance you know there's there's we do a section we'd be up we'd be up talking
[01:42:25] for an hour answering questions for an hour and a half when we'd get done with that hour and a half
[01:42:30] we would just step forward to the stage and step down onto the floor and there'd be people
[01:42:36] lined up to say hey what about this hey you just said that and what do you think I should do here
[01:42:39] and it was like that for for two straight days and not just after the sessions but morning work
[01:42:44] gets right and we are our our zero four four four five club PT's that we're cranking out these awesome workouts and
[01:42:50] and we I mean all levels of athletes there's some really high in you know athletes or
[01:42:56] black credible and you know you did two players to to the you know just just some folks who've just
[01:43:01] started training or just started hitting the gym and encouraged to but podcast or whatnot
[01:43:05] and came out participating that and and walking you know jogging over to or walking back
[01:43:10] from those those workouts talking those leaders and people talking what would you do in this situation you
[01:43:15] know I remember having those conversations with people and you're helping them apply that stuff
[01:43:20] we've heard do social media so many of those people some of those specific conversations like
[01:43:24] I can't believe how good this word here's what's going on I'm not I'm not able to I just got a
[01:43:28] promotion you know based on this you know those kind of that kind of feedback we always talk about
[01:43:33] right there's only two measures that matter effective and ineffective and and how do you measure
[01:43:37] that it's whether the team is is accomplished in the mission you're effective you're not
[01:43:40] accomplished in mission that matter hard you work and you're not effective and for us that
[01:43:44] measure effectiveness is that people are actually going out and kicking ass in their world and
[01:43:49] they're getting promoted they're accomplished in their mission they're building a better team
[01:43:53] they're building better relationships with their boss you know with their peers with the sub
[01:43:57] contractor they work for with you know and they're they're being more engaged members of their
[01:44:03] community you know a better parent a better coach a better team member across all walks of life and
[01:44:08] I think that's really our measure effectiveness and it was it's just awesome to see so many folks
[01:44:15] doing extraordinary things that were part of the the the monster and so looking forward to that
[01:44:20] may 4th of 5th in New York it's going to be awesome and it's going to be exactly what you describe
[01:44:23] we're going to we're going to keep that no matter how long we do this or how big the
[01:44:28] monsters get I never want to never want it to be to lose that of of me and you stay engaged
[01:44:35] you know with participants not hide behind the curtain somewhere in the green room but be an
[01:44:40] out front talker people talking with leaders you know and help them apply the stuff to get
[01:44:45] better what they do this ain't the Wizard of Oz we ain't going to be hiding behind the curtain
[01:44:49] and you know and you talk about measures of success effective ineffective well for me like the
[01:44:59] biggest reward from doing the monster it's it's similar to what we do with our with our business
[01:45:05] of help and businesses and it's always great to get that feedback but to get a mass scale
[01:45:09] of you know 3 or 400 people and get that feedback about the promotions the advancements
[01:45:14] the goals achieve the fitness goals achieved the relationship goals to get that feedback has just been
[01:45:22] it's been awesome so like you said we look forward to seeing you there and you know
[01:45:27] actually speaking of the monster you're going to see life yeah you're going to see me of course
[01:45:34] you're going to see JP and Dave Dave Burke JP to now they're going to be there
[01:45:39] you're also going to see echo draws he's going to be there fully and kind of cruising to
[01:45:48] but he's going to be not fully cruising hard so you can get to meet most people want to meet
[01:45:55] echo the most he's like the base player in the band that like you know there's the lead guitarist
[01:46:02] and then there's the lead vocalist who's out front with the weird pants on but everyone looks
[01:46:08] at the basis in the back that's hammering down the tracks laying it down
[01:46:11] cruising echo draws cruising you're going to get to meet him so that was amazing me actually the
[01:46:17] number of people lined up to take pictures with you and talk to you I was getting jealous it was like
[01:46:24] that was awesome you finally they don't ask me like real questions though it's more like on a
[01:46:28] social level which I like that you want to keep it that way yeah easy questions if you got
[01:46:33] like a leadership question you go to life you can go to me if you want to do some socializing
[01:46:39] line get in that echo draws line go and shake his hand you want to get in that echo
[01:46:45] draws line one one thing about the buster in New Yorker particular is you know like anything in
[01:46:50] New York City get a limited space and we saw a lot of takes of that thing already if you want to be
[01:46:54] there for for it may force the fifth get your tickets now because I think we're going to sell this thing out
[01:46:59] and I think that's that's highly likely so it may those may not be there I would I would get those things
[01:47:05] purchased ASAP if you if you want to be a part of that yeah do it big part that I noticed from the last
[01:47:12] muster is the P you mentioned this before where people will come in they'll learn all this cool stuff and you know
[01:47:18] like minded people but they become like real good friends you know so like like that night when we had
[01:47:25] the the the the training that night you could tell I thought that all these guys came they all came together
[01:47:30] yeah not they didn't come together they just became friends and now they're cruising as friends now
[01:47:35] and there's people you know doing things now yeah we got podcasts you know
[01:47:41] now you know Brady and Simon also
[01:47:46] Debbie and Sonia and Sonia yeah they got a podcast going there's but there's someone else
[01:47:51] anyways so there's people that are that's the what Athena's podcast you got the trooper podcast
[01:47:58] trooper project you know modernism modern Athena's so there's things that are coming out those those
[01:48:04] are people that just met they weren't friends rolling into the buster they formed relationships
[01:48:09] and now they're out just crushing things yeah and that's how you know how like I mean
[01:48:13] Jiu-jitsu does this a lot where you come in and you're like you know by yourself and then after a while
[01:48:18] hey this guy likes Jiu-jitsu this guy likes Jiu-jitsu oh wait but wait hey you watched I don't know you know
[01:48:23] same the same show and slowly like how why you five oh slowly you start to gravitate towards
[01:48:31] these people but this in this kind of situation everyone's kind of like um like they're trying to
[01:48:36] get better you know better at this and it's so it's real similar to that life at life in general so
[01:48:42] it's almost like a double gravitation effect you know people like that's a scientific thing
[01:48:48] to buy the way so you know people don't know about the double gravitation effect
[01:48:53] with the buster double gravitation effect is in full effect across the board
[01:48:59] bro and it's funny because you see it you see like everyone's all talking you know like
[01:49:03] if I step back I see you and life talking you can kind of tell like all you guys if you know
[01:49:07] each other for a long time that's kind of what you see but then you realize oh they haven't
[01:49:11] known each other for a long time it's just pure double gravitation effect I think someone that
[01:49:16] cross over to is you know when you realize that you know a police officer who's sitting next to you
[01:49:21] has some of the same challenge that you have as a as a as a a small business you know entrepreneur
[01:49:26] who has the same problems as this guy who's CEO of a big company who has the same problems as
[01:49:31] this person who's in a startup so yeah who have by the way the same problems that late for
[01:49:36] night saw an experienced all in the battlefield yeah and their solution this is the thing
[01:49:43] those problems their solutions to them yeah they're out there this isn't this isn't magic
[01:49:49] as a matter of fact I know all of it well bust you down here but there ain't no magic there's
[01:49:54] knowledge speaking it's like you did to right do you know magic to do you sometimes I do say magic
[01:50:00] magic cool magical but you do say it's a superpower it's a superpower and speaking to you
[01:50:04] it's it we're gonna be trying some that's right that's right Friday even we're gonna be getting
[01:50:08] on so if you come to the monster I'm gonna go nogie for travel purposes is that cool yeah okay
[01:50:15] so we'll go plan the nogie situation plus echo like do you like nogie better it goes in phases
[01:50:22] so right now it's only only so you can wear your your your your tupper your tupper yes yes yes
[01:50:28] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure so that
[01:50:35] is gonna happen echo like I said back to my point echo Charles will be there and come and see him
[01:50:44] and in the meantime echo if somebody does want to support this podcast can you let us know
[01:50:51] out and do it yeah man there's a few ways but I recommend supporting yourself we talked about being
[01:50:58] prepared right life weapon so good way to prepare is to train and with training comes help which
[01:51:05] is supplementation I was one of these guys who didn't wasn't into supplements ever like all that's
[01:51:12] like it's fake don't need it and really it's kind of true you kind of don't need it so I thought
[01:51:20] but if you get the right kind of something like okay so you you know we talk about krill oil okay
[01:51:25] supplements do matter something talk about some so you don't want to roll the other
[01:51:32] down when's last of my saw you a couple days ago I don't know yeah anyway I went in
[01:51:39] like training with Chris Rue's and he's he saw you guys rolling yes so I was there that day okay so
[01:51:43] we were so finished by the way yeah and he goes hard back belt goes hard yeah and I think I did
[01:51:48] around with him so fish yeah why do we call him so fish because he's hard to get a whole
[01:51:53] kind of fish covered in soap yeah hold on to him yeah he's like hard slick and wiry you know
[01:51:59] and greasy with a black belt and has that back yeah it's one thing to be like a you know
[01:52:05] in untrained soap fish which can be hard enough by the way anyway the point is I go with him I
[01:52:11] did three rounds with him you know and a few more rounds with other people and you know that feeling
[01:52:18] when you do a workout and you're like oh I feel like I feel like the workout's not done I don't
[01:52:22] feel like it's not like exhausted as I need to be after workout like this yeah so I kind of had
[01:52:29] that feeling or I'm like okay I need to do it like who can I go with like a hard you know I need to
[01:52:33] go like another round right and I remember that I took the shuntak yeah you kind of forget about
[01:52:38] because I took it I don't mean this in a bad way I don't yeah I don't mean this as a backhanded
[01:52:45] this can be bad comment sure but for everyone that doesn't quite know I don't normally see you
[01:52:55] as a guy that's going I need to get one more round yeah that's you right a lot of times you're like
[01:53:03] not actually good you know that one you're actually not right oh you know you're talking about the
[01:53:08] old me okay yeah the prezes this is pre-shromteck this is the style with that one you're talking
[01:53:13] about pre-shromteck pre-metcon well yeah we get you in shunt yeah yeah so no that's not me you know
[01:53:20] I like you know that that is to your full credit you know you are different now not just because
[01:53:27] of your skill level in GD2 but also because of your your metcon your endurance and all that you've
[01:53:33] definitely you you used to be done oh yeah so and I and I talk about this for the where that's a
[01:53:40] good point though because one kind of plays off the other especially if you don't like being tired so
[01:53:47] if you get tired early you're like you're gonna do less and you're gonna try less things you're
[01:53:52] gonna you know because you're kind of fighting that fight as well you know so when that tiredness
[01:53:57] goes away and you know how to deal with being tired you're like okay now I'm kind of free to
[01:54:03] try this if it fails I can try it again I can not you know if you're if you're not in good shape
[01:54:07] or if you if you buckle to being tired it's like you only have a few bullets in the clip and once you're
[01:54:12] done you're kind of like oh my guns were worthless now you know the gun looks good from lifting weights
[01:54:18] and you know all this stuff but it's done after a few bullets but you load up the bullets
[01:54:24] endless bullets right you can go shoot targets here to anyway well it is I will get since I gave you a
[01:54:31] a negative on the old you I'll say the new you got some you got some good you got that you
[01:54:38] did too yeah which is way better than it used to be yeah even even the old echo Charles though
[01:54:42] when we were rolling back in the day with a cutter our mutual friend cake nuts and I he he your
[01:54:49] eyes you're always he'd go another round particularly for us it was when he is our skill level was far below
[01:54:54] his oh he likes his way you should let's do another round with me smashing you and keep in mind
[01:55:00] in my defense this is jockel's evaluation when he's like you're done well yeah when you're rolling
[01:55:05] with jockel you're kind of done you know but it's not like I was just this sack of potatoes those
[01:55:11] just don't it was like roll with the white belts you have a full of rounds that's what I'm here
[01:55:16] here from may have the standard that comes out of jockel is very high you say no I'm not
[01:55:22] you're statement of the year not that he's wrong not that he's wrong listen I'm and he's
[01:55:27] just full of compliments on the time yeah yeah Dave did that thing you did as I was like hey
[01:55:31] did I say something like this you know I think it was like something positive about life
[01:55:35] and he's like yeah you did say that and I remember it because it's like the one of the four
[01:55:39] compliments you give me in the last 12 years oh that's cool don't happen often got a note of
[01:55:45] I know the one they don't but that is true and it does help and not in just that way though not in
[01:55:50] just the way like oh I can I mean better shaping that's good that's true but you just you can
[01:55:56] do jiu jitsu no without that added enemy in there so you're like free to do more jiu jitsu
[01:56:01] so to sum up the last 12 minutes of conversation what you're saying is on a dot com slash
[01:56:09] choco yeah you know I got into the story it was a good one my opinion yeah no that day that's how
[01:56:17] I felt I felt like my work I was actually I was actually I was actually thinking the same thing
[01:56:22] because the other thing about Chris so fish is he moves a lot is a mover and when you move
[01:56:30] even if the guy's lighter than you you have to move with them or you're gonna get you're gonna
[01:56:34] get caught and so you had to move you couldn't stop moving and he's gonna move all the time on you
[01:56:38] and that's why I was really impressed with the fact that I've trained you so well
[01:56:46] how's it best without you kept bringing you know kept and you want to do another round I could
[01:56:51] see it so good on good on true tech and I did take and that con the thing is you forget you
[01:56:57] did you just fish could I took it like like an hour before even well I guess it was about an hour
[01:57:04] before it actually was rolling but it was like maybe half hour for a left I don't kind of forgot
[01:57:09] I'll tell you in this whole idea of shrimp tech and what's the other one performance
[01:57:13] total strength the coke or something or it's like a strawberry banana yeah so if that's
[01:57:20] considered cheating then I've been cheating a lot lately because it's a lot of times I've already
[01:57:26] worked out in the day I've been up all day I went sir I did a bunch of stuff so it's not like I'm
[01:57:31] rolling in to the gym or to train the jiu-jitsu being off fresh I haven't been getting a massage
[01:57:37] all day no I'm not actually grinding it out all day and so sometimes I need to get on so
[01:57:42] that yeah and so this is really why I say it's cheating because I'm always saying it while I'm
[01:57:49] looking at you and it's cheating if it's like me against you who's you know who's the
[01:57:53] better warrior kind of thing and so all but you're on shrimp tech okay okay so you have a little
[01:57:59] help then so you know but no if you're training and you want to learn jiu-jitsu or you want to
[01:58:05] push performance so you because that's how you get gains you recover from exercise and you want to
[01:58:10] push exercise and you want to in jiu-jitsu situation where you want to train be able to train longer
[01:58:16] without you know the burden of this fatigue where you might have to quit at a certain time or whatever
[01:58:20] don't have to quit not well you know what I mean you don't have to quit it is helpful this
[01:58:26] shroom tech it's a somewhere when you get rabdo and you start pissing on it no right
[01:58:32] yeah you probably time it sure you gotta stop it take some recovery yeah all right this is my non-verbal
[01:58:37] signal for let's move to the next item when I do this yeah no but there's still a lot to be said though
[01:58:42] that's the thing see and I think that's really the value of this whole thing is that this needs to be
[01:58:47] talked about if I knew this like back in the you were talking about that echo that you were talking
[01:58:56] about if I knew this kind of stuff echo one point oh yeah I would I would have spent very
[01:59:00] little time at that point oh you all that against me because I could have told you about this
[01:59:03] stuff earlier now I don't man you know that's life maybe I was afraid to
[01:59:09] anyway no I wasn't it late I don't know if you're on the shroom tech or whatever
[01:59:14] crude oil that's a big one I haven't tried shroom tech but I just got a new order of acrylic
[01:59:18] oil and actually from on it so you just pull that I got I got some strong bone as well yeah strong
[01:59:23] one that's good yeah those are good because they keep you in like you can yeah I do like super
[01:59:28] deep squats and I had knee surgery full on ACL like all this stuff deep squats all the way no problem

[02:02:27] may or may not give you 19% improvement in all performance
[02:02:30] why are you saying may not i think that's like um the scientifically literate way to put it
[02:02:39] nobody there's it's it's actually will because there's no one that said hey i didn't get the
[02:02:43] 19% out of this gig yeah i think it yeah actually yeah you're right there you go boy it's
[02:02:48] yeah it's at 18.7% yeah you know you get one of these slackers that maybe you know
[02:02:54] if you have the rush guard you're probably not a slacker so i guess that's invalid as well
[02:02:57] um but yeah anyway jocco store dot com that's that's where you can get all the you know rush guards
[02:03:03] and cool shirts i think they're cool you made uh we went through great lengths to get the good shirts

[02:03:28] you know you're cool check them out if you like them support that way get one and represent
[02:03:32] and psychological warfare okay so i'm going to go into psychological warfare if you don't know
[02:03:36] psychological warfare if you're at a moment of weakness and your diet work out uh waking up in the
[02:03:41] morning he need a little boost little like someone there to sort of gently spot you help you through
[02:03:46] these moments of weakness you go on iTunes maybe Amazon music wherever you can buy MP3's
[02:03:55] get psychological warfare jocco will link a little tracks you can listen you can put it as your alarm
[02:04:01] if you want or just listen to the whatever track you need and he'll get you through it i'm telling
[02:04:05] you here's the thing so yes and day before yesterday i was about to work out felt like working
[02:04:12] you know rested boom you know took my pre workout stuff ready i was like oh listen the
[02:04:19] psychological warfare at my moment of strength has this ever been tried before i don't know that's
[02:04:24] the thing that's what i was thinking at the time bro it's kind of like abuse you know how like
[02:04:30] you know how like your drink coffee or something like fucking kind of tired i'm going to drink some coffee
[02:04:34] and when you're not tired you drink it's like whaah i'm buzzing off the end you have that good feeling
[02:04:38] now you're like double coffee to up ready to get after it that's how you feel it's like i'm
[02:04:44] abusing the psychological warfare only for moments of weakness for moments of triumph is what it is
[02:04:50] that's it not even so even if you're feeling weak and you want to move to triumph that's what it is
[02:04:55] it's what how is the workout is the question workout was dope of course it was dope check me out bro
[02:05:00] pump still on anyway good um you know while you're clicking through amazon by the way you can get
[02:05:12] on amazon dot com you can get jockel white t now there's other reports have come in
[02:05:17] and this report well i found interesting because this is a side effect apparently of the t
[02:05:21] of the t and that is and this could be a positive side effect or could be a negative side effect
[02:05:26] depending on who you are but one guy reported that he drank some tea at night and he had one
[02:05:31] point five inches of beard growth overnight so if you want that it could be positive could be negative
[02:05:39] and also we had a police officer out there and and again this is just i'm just given some new
[02:05:45] some new testament testimonies that have come in this one um one police officer he's shooting
[02:05:53] the l president a drill which is a drill where you have two targets and you should two rounds
[02:05:57] in each target and you do reloaded and his time has decreased which is an improvement right so he's
[02:06:03] not be able to do this faster 31% which i think is really good especially numbers yeah
[02:06:09] this is a critical situation right you got two bad guys and then you got to do reload you might
[02:06:14] want to have some jockel white t that's almost double the 19% yeah it's good yeah and and a thing
[02:06:20] is that i want to make sure everybody understands is that this isn't like conjecture in some
[02:06:26] pseudo science that i'm talking about here this is 147% factual so everyone should know that so
[02:06:34] order the t the jockel white t also you can order a new book which is called way of the warrior
[02:06:42] kid and i got asked why wrote this the other day and one of the things that propelled me to write this
[02:06:50] book was i was looking for a book when my son was a little younger how's looking for a book for a
[02:06:55] boy to read it's good a book and so you know i wanted him to read kind of a book right kind of a
[02:07:02] book about getting after it right so i went out and i looked through a couple books and i finally found
[02:07:07] this pirate book and i got a cool pirate book i didn't pay too much attention i didn't like look
[02:07:10] through it because it's a pirate book right pirate are swords and ships taking over right good storming
[02:07:20] vessels i can see so i go into the book i break bring it home to my son we start reading the book
[02:07:28] and um they were weak and so now i'm like trying to get my son you know
[02:07:33] pardon up and in the game and he's reading about weak pirates they weren't they didn't even attack anybody right
[02:07:40] so i realize that there's a death of books for children not just boys but boys and girls
[02:07:48] that will show someone how to get after that a young age right which you can start getting after
[02:07:53] it at birth by the way there's no reason to wait there's no legal minimum age of to be 18
[02:07:58] okay i see your kid get after it lessons you get after i be card no you can start getting
[02:08:02] at after at birth so that's one of the reasons that i wrote a book about a kid who's
[02:08:11] not gonna be a pansy and not gonna be wimpy he actually is in the beginning he's feeling pretty
[02:08:17] weak you know how many polyps you can do so many zero polyps it's not good you know you know
[02:08:24] he's you know you know well he knows his time stables how well he doesn't know him but no it's time stables that's
[02:08:33] weak i guess what can he swim no cancel him and last thing is he getting picked on yeah can he
[02:08:41] williamson can he williamson the bully he's all up on him pushing him around he can't stand up
[02:08:47] to him doesn't know what to do so is that a good way to go through life i don't know you tell me
[02:08:52] zero polyps do you want to be able to do zero polyps echo lathe no not good get be able to do some
[02:08:57] polyps yeah so that's why wrote the book so that the kid out there they can't do any polyps
[02:09:05] maybe he's getting picked on maybe maybe he can't swim but maybe there's some other thing in his
[02:09:09] life that he we all got issues you know we all got some we got overcome we all got feared overcome
[02:09:14] guess what we talk about fear in the book because everyone lathe was talking about today we all
[02:09:18] get afraid how you can overcome that well luckily for mark in the book his uncle Jake shows up
[02:09:24] uncle Jake was in the sealed teams he's got some lessons to teach to young mark and that's what he does
[02:09:30] so you can preorder it right now way the warrior kid and you know what we got to make some
[02:09:36] t-shirts on that one yeah kids t-shirts yeah the few parts that you did tell me it's even you
[02:09:44] explain you like that's a good little explanation of it it's good but the little parts that you
[02:09:50] were telling me were were kind of impressive like there is that's kind of advanced for a kids book
[02:09:56] even you know in a good way meaning like it's not you know there's certain obvious things that
[02:10:00] you you know you're gonna find any kids book right even with stories like this it's like okay
[02:10:05] I know the narrative I get it we had it has to be that way to you know to teach the lesson effective all
[02:10:09] this stuff but the little hints of complexity they're impressive I gotta say the other thing that
[02:10:17] is even when I read right now just finished finalists edits and you're like there's so much in there
[02:10:25] that's actually from the podcast but it's for a kid it's put in a kid's language
[02:10:30] yeah uncle Jake's breaking it down real simple so that's why that's why I don't care who you are
[02:10:35] you want to broken down that's a law combat in the book extreme ownership written by
[02:10:40] late babbit myself gotta keep things simple so it's in a simple way so that's where the
[02:10:45] warrior kid and also by the way just released another book it's called this puny
[02:10:52] cool freedom field manual and this is the this is the ebook that I talked about here in a long
[02:10:59] time ago I'm gonna write an ebook right well it turned into a real book and it's broken
[02:11:05] into two parts one part is called thoughts the other part is called actions these are actually my
[02:11:13] thoughts and my actions so what are thoughts well what I think about what's going on what I think
[02:11:19] about when you run up against weakness what do you think those are the thoughts and then actions
[02:11:23] is okay how do you act which means workouts are in there which means talks about martial arts
[02:11:29] talks about what I eat how I sleep and that kind of stuff so preorder it check it out
[02:11:40] and it will help them logistically when the book comes out because see the publishers
[02:11:49] they don't understand what we're doing here they don't know what we're doing here they don't know
[02:11:54] and when I'm talking about we I'm not talking about you I'm not talking about we I'm talking about
[02:11:58] we yeah yeah they understand what we're doing here they understand that there's troopers that
[02:12:03] want to get after it so and they don't understand that they're like okay well you know I guess
[02:12:09] we'll print I guess we'll print 400 copies of that so not way you know again it's time someone can
[02:12:14] buy it but they don't know for me let's good they don't know what they're talking about so
[02:12:19] preorder so they understand what we are doing here maybe we'll get some of them in the game actually
[02:12:26] okay so that's that and you know speaking of books
[02:12:33] life I was talking about a little book called extreme ownership what are you hearing from the
[02:12:38] field on extreme ownership right now the book that we wrote I'm I'm here a lot from the field
[02:12:45] on extreme ownership I mean what's what's awesome to me about extreme ownership is just
[02:12:49] continues the resonate with people you know and even you know we're over a year and a half out of
[02:12:54] publication now and that this thing continues to be in the top 150 or 200 on Amazon and so much
[02:13:03] of that as a word of mouth driven you know that people are buying that for their team you know
[02:13:06] and holding well we're waiting a bit we'll did help with that big ad that we put in the New York
[02:13:11] Times did that help sell it oh wait no we didn't do that oh maybe it's the TV spots that we
[02:13:16] don't know we didn't do that either so word of mouth it is exactly and not you know for that
[02:13:22] that's the real testament I think for you know for me that we wrote a book that's resin
[02:13:27] with leaders that's helping them get better to lead better teams for people to to be better
[02:13:32] teammates and employ these concepts in extreme ownership you know when we see them you know
[02:13:36] the the fire service training that's going on you know and face firefighters are using that
[02:13:42] as they're they're training man in a conduct in these these training or we see police police
[02:13:46] units doing it we see businesses you know and some of them bring us in and have training
[02:13:51] some of them they're holding their own training they're buying that book and they're they're
[02:13:54] learning out of it I was working with the business just just just a couple weeks back where they
[02:13:59] you know each each group in this leadership team was assigned to study a chapter and talk about
[02:14:05] how what did that chapter apply to them and they're they're they're learning out of that and it's
[02:14:09] inspiring to see that stuff because not only is it is it you know does it say hey we wrote a book
[02:14:13] that's having some impact but when you see the things that they're doing when they're implementing
[02:14:17] extreme ownership when they're using cover move and they're not focused on themselves but about
[02:14:21] the mission and work together as a team and and using decentralized community you know it's playing
[02:14:25] the why to their teams and and the results are amazing you know see that happen and and that's really
[02:14:32] you know that's really what it's all about for us I think is seeing that kind of impact so
[02:14:37] it's been awesome to see that and looking forward for that to continue to grow and expand
[02:14:44] it's reach across the globe you know we we talk about in the book we talk about work on
[02:14:48] the Iraqi soldiers and one of the hardest things obviously even if you took a great soldier
[02:14:54] but they don't speak the language you speak any of a language barrier that's a real problem so
[02:14:58] a lot of times in these teams what the book gives them what the extreme ownership gives them it
[02:15:02] gives them a a language common language to talk about the issues the leadership problems that they're
[02:15:08] having they can identify because how can you fight an enemy that you can identify so if you know
[02:15:13] if you don't know that hey our decentralized command is weak and if you don't know what that is and
[02:15:18] you can identify how can you fix it if you got a cover move to solve problems and work together
[02:15:23] but you don't know what that looks like or you don't even know what to call it how are you going to
[02:15:27] get it solved so that's one of the things that I notice when we show up at a company that already is
[02:15:34] using it and have read it they're immediately saying you know hey this is the this situation
[02:15:39] we got we got these divisions over here in this division over here and we're not covering moving for
[02:15:42] each other we we got to identify and you go okay so they've already got a grip on it when people
[02:15:46] that we go and talk to they they haven't read the book yet they can't even really identify what's wrong
[02:15:52] they just don't see it they don't have the the ability it's like not having night vision they just
[02:15:57] they just don't see it so the book when you get that book out there everyone on your team
[02:16:01] and all of a sudden they all have that common language they all can identify targets they know
[02:16:06] what the bad guys look like and they know how to fix it and that's that's what I notice that's
[02:16:11] awesome about when we work with these companies and they're in the game big time and then the
[02:16:17] the master may force in fifth New York City go to extreme ownership dot com sign up now like I said
[02:16:23] before I think this thing is probably gonna sell out so if you want tickets if you want to be there
[02:16:27] if you want to be a part of this bad ass event that we just we were talking about just this amazing
[02:16:33] group of people of us leaders and aspiring leaders to get in the game sign up now extreme ownership
[02:16:39] dot com I will not get you doing a speech for the record just so you know everyone echo doesn't
[02:16:46] think he's gonna give a speech we think he probably should how about a side speech no speech
[02:16:53] we're doing all the time yeah echo echo is echo is a very laid back you know the the good
[02:16:59] island that when we put him up on stage for the master he was not happy about that no
[02:17:04] that was just to say thanks yeah you and in your shell not man I got it you're welcome hey
[02:17:11] you know on with the shell so you know we you gotta we talk about you gotta focus on your weaknesses
[02:17:16] right so that I think you need to present at least for a couple hours on the stage so I got to talk
[02:17:21] about those ones because it just happened again so the echo's got this thing where he goes into
[02:17:25] this alternate voice at the end of some sentences and I noticed in one of the last podcast that
[02:17:30] I actually started doing it too so I'm gonna spend saying hey jockel what have you gotten from echo
[02:17:35] well I think the one thing that I could say I definitely got from echo is doing this thing right here
[02:17:40] because that's what he just did it he just did it so pay attention to that I don't know what
[02:17:44] and you know what I call that I'm gonna call that the echo voice escalation yeah so you just
[02:17:50] talking normal and then all of a sudden you go into that echo voice escalation so that you got
[02:17:54] your own thing now it's effective see there you do that that one that one a before the master
[02:18:02] until the master if you want to give us feedbacks or comments or whatever do you want to
[02:18:08] continue this conversation you you can actually find us not hard to find find us on the interwebs
[02:18:17] Twitter Instagrammy and of course of course you want to find us on that page pocket ball
[02:18:28] we gonna be there that one. Lafe is at Lafe Babin echo is at echo Charles and I am
[02:18:37] at jockel will like echo do you have anything else to add right now oh man oh yeah actually I do
[02:18:46] and I heard you mentioned this before where you talking about in Ramadi where you know the sun
[02:18:52] comes up and you say you hear the call to prayer I know what that is but what what is that sound like
[02:18:58] what is the call to prayer you know what is it a person like on a it is a person it's a person
[02:19:04] around loudspeaker right so each mosque has a minirat which is a tower and they generally have a loudspeaker
[02:19:11] and so you've got I forget what you the title is and the Islamic world there's a specific
[02:19:18] title for the prayer call or that's gonna get up and sing this prayer but yeah you just hear
[02:19:24] these speakers going off all over the city it's like a chant yeah they sing you know they sing
[02:19:30] that's a song so it's so many that you know when you hear that you know like the so they'll be
[02:19:35] one early in the morning so like before the sun comes up and we had to be in place you know you're
[02:19:39] going you're going in emitator you had to be in the building locked down ready to go because as soon
[02:19:44] as the call to prayer goes down you know that the city's gonna start awakening you know we're
[02:19:48] gonna start you know coming out of their houses and cars start n up and people moving around and
[02:19:53] and the sun's gonna come up you know pretty soon and so yeah there's there's there's five of
[02:19:57] those throughout the day and you know that would be the you give that that morning call the prayer
[02:20:03] was like we're gonna get some you're gonna get the enemy the enemy in Ramadi for the most part
[02:20:08] didn't operate at nighttime because we had all the advantages of night vision everything
[02:20:12] else so they operated during the day so the indicator that the day was starting is the first
[02:20:17] morning call the prayer and when you hear it you know man that's so crazy how it's like it's like
[02:20:22] this official beginning of the day you know a call that's like the official commencement of the day
[02:20:30] in that crazy I guess you think it's crazy I mean we have that individually you know your alarm clock
[02:20:34] or your whatever but like for everybody yeah that's what that's one of the things that makes it so
[02:20:42] so crazy is that it is the whole city every day you know because like one actually this was
[02:20:48] one a at one point they said hey you weren't allowed then the way they say we weren't allowed to go within a block of
[02:20:52] of a mosque or something like that and there's so many mosques in Ramadi we just showed them
[02:20:57] my map and we're like okay so you don't want us to do anything because if we can't go within two
[02:21:01] blocks of a mosque or whatever the rule that they try to throw at us you know said so you don't want
[02:21:05] us to do anything else on this deployment because here's a mosque here's a mosque here's a mosque
[02:21:10] here's a mosque and by the way Intel says this mosque is okay local mosque Intel says this one's bad
[02:21:15] this one's bad this one's good so we had you know different different you know because just because
[02:21:21] someone's the mosque some of the some of the neighbors are saying oh great it's called a pair
[02:21:25] we're ready start a beautiful day just some of the people but the smaller group of people was saying
[02:21:30] oh here's the called a prayer let's go and attack Americans and in torture the local populace so
[02:21:35] and unfortunately because the mosque were protected and we had to get massive approvals all the way up
[02:21:40] to like the highest levels to be able to enter the mosque the the bad guys knew that and they'd use
[02:21:45] those mosques to to stage attacks out of you know and they they stock power weapons and ammunition
[02:21:51] and and that stuff there so the bad guys figured out it was it was not good crazy the little detail
[02:21:59] so you know I mean that I mean I always hear from like you guys just a little detail stuff that you
[02:22:03] don't necessarily think about the gun fights and all this stuff but just those little details
[02:22:10] kind of makes it real man it's crazy any other questions echo trolls or comments no sorry
[02:22:20] very good to see life again that's it good late for got anything else brother yeah just
[02:22:27] great to be back on here with you guys again you know it's awesome thinking back to the you know podcast
[02:22:32] 11 you know I was the first guest and just getting this thing up and running you know and and to
[02:22:38] see the reach that it's that it's had you know as as the expansion and you know and where we're
[02:22:44] sitting today you know versus where it was then you know third time I'm back on it's pretty
[02:22:48] pretty awesome pretty awesome see that and I've so many people I've been sitting in
[02:22:52] jujitsu classes before someone here's me talk and like are you really bad exactly I guess
[02:22:58] it's the the last me voice is it is given me a way but they're like I started trained
[02:23:03] jujitsu because the jaccopacass and I've had that happen multiple times you know whether in
[02:23:08] jujitsu class or meeting someone you know randomly in an airport or those kind of things and
[02:23:13] but just awesome it's awesome to see true persol over the world you know all over the
[02:23:18] place get after it you know through and loyal listeners jaccopacass and passing it on to others
[02:23:25] I echo asked me that because we we get a lot of people that on social media they say hey
[02:23:30] I just enlisted in the army I just listened to Marine Corps I've gone OCS a lot of people you know thanks for
[02:23:35] you know pushing me that way or whatever and echo says you know like hey do you think how many people do you think
[02:23:42] of actually joined the military because of the podcast and I said you know I don't know what that number
[02:23:48] looks like but there's the amount of people that have started jujitsu because the podcast is a big number
[02:23:56] it's a big number which is awesome because obviously you know jujitsu is really good for me. I think the
[02:24:00] number of people joined the military is probably substantial as well in fact I was just talking to a
[02:24:03] young lady last night at the event we were speaking at who came up to me and said hey I'm thinking
[02:24:08] about joining the Navy and you know I said she just started listening to the jaccopacass I think
[02:24:12] those are very much related I told her to go buy a copy of the stream ownership and you know to
[02:24:18] learn from that and take ownership everything in the world she's gonna do well so she was she was an EMT
[02:24:23] and yeah one area a Navy corpsman so I think so many people from all walks of life
[02:24:29] influenced for good by the jaccopacass. It's definitely definitely definitely awesome for us to be
[02:24:37] a part of it and get all that feedback all the time and of course there's no coincidence in the
[02:24:41] fact that you were the first guest on here obviously I just did an echo escalation that was that was
[02:24:48] good. I could you have an influence in the world. I mean finally I hope there's not someone out there
[02:24:55] that doesn't like it and blames you and then goes on a crazy like stalker mission to eliminate
[02:25:01] you from the world. Yeah okay lucky is pretty good at jajitsu I think you take care of yourself and
[02:25:06] he's got a lot of knives and hatchets so nice nice any other closers yeah you know I was just thinking
[02:25:12] we were in that conversation yesterday you know and as a dad of young kids you know I've got
[02:25:19] I've got a toddler and a baby and you know I know echo you got so you got young kids as well
[02:25:26] and you know just thinking about it can be all you parents out there you know I'm talking about right
[02:25:32] it can be exhausting you know we go through a time it's winter time you got kids you've got
[02:25:36] colds and they're sick and they're waking up multiple times the night cutting into my my 445 club workouts
[02:25:42] you know and it's it's easy to like it's easy you know when my my little baby girl crawls around
[02:25:48] the floor she just tries to eat everything you know picks up the choking hazards and and
[02:25:55] shoves them around like you gotta keep an eye on the concoxity you know and my son is just a wild man
[02:26:00] he's just he'll he'll just know fear of anything he's just I'm learning that he's just like me
[02:26:05] and I realize what my parents actually put up with but he takes off running for the most dangerous
[02:26:09] thing within a mile radius and and he just like without looking back and without heating any
[02:26:16] warning or command to stop for me whatsoever so so it's it is full time and I'm in the game all
[02:26:22] the time and it can be exhausting you know it can be it's something that you can think oh man
[02:26:27] I just can't wait till they get a little bit older and I don't have to you know I can tell
[02:26:30] on the stop or he knows not to run in the street or my daughter's not choking on something she
[02:26:35] you know and and and the reality is you know just being out of a jocco and seeing his kids you know
[02:26:41] and you're all the starters by the graduate now from from high school which is amazing to me
[02:26:46] because when I left you know San Diego here you're you're you're kids they were kids they were
[02:26:52] little you know and watch them grow up and the teenagers now and you know when we first met we
[02:26:56] started working at the testing and they were really little you know you're young as I'm even
[02:27:01] born and you're still in was just a I mean just a baby a two or three year old yeah and and so
[02:27:08] I just I realize it doesn't seem like I left the Navy that long ago you know it's it'll be six
[02:27:13] years of summer and I realize that time has flown by like that it is just going by like that and
[02:27:20] and so seeing that you know and seeing your kids now I I got to take a step back the detachment
[02:27:25] that we always talk about right to be able to see with a bigger perspective and to think
[02:27:30] these moments right they they're awesome and I got to relish every
[02:27:36] nanosecond of them because my kids are going to grow up and they're going to be teenagers and
[02:27:41] they're going to graduate my school and they're going to go off and I got to rest you know for me
[02:27:44] and my wife we got to cherish those moments and people tell you that you know but you still don't
[02:27:50] even like embrace you know you still like oh if I can just get to this level
[02:27:54] you're worried about the diaper the dirty diaper and the apple sauce or exactly you know and
[02:28:01] or you know my kid just went through my drawer and through everything out and I get to clean that up
[02:28:06] and we're trying to get out the door so I think for me it's a great recognition of like
[02:28:10] that those moments are fleeting and they're precious and you got to enjoy every second of that so
[02:28:16] for you parents out there listen to this if you're in that boat with me detach take a step back think
[02:28:22] about how wonderful those moments are and just just relish it relish every moment and
[02:28:31] don't let yourself get flustered don't let yourself get overwhelmed if your kids get
[02:28:37] up a fourth hour anymore and maybe it's time to back it up to a zero three hundred but
[02:28:43] embrace every every second of that as a parent and cherish those moments because those are
[02:28:48] the most important things about Brad all give you a small tip that helped me with that you know
[02:28:54] when like certain things get overwhelming you try to do this and they're crying and then the
[02:28:58] other ones doing something and you're like you kind of want to yell at them be like hey I need a
[02:29:02] minute or something but they're like kids are like a minute what does that even mean kind of thing
[02:29:07] they don't know so the tip there is anytime you feel it bubbling up like you're getting frustrated
[02:29:12] understand that you're at that moment making it about yourself and it's not about yourself you
[02:29:18] know it's about whether you can look at it I'm gonna make it about the mission or I'm gonna make
[02:29:22] it about these kids make it about something other than yourself and you won't be frustrated anymore
[02:29:28] telling you anytime in time you're like oh I've been up all night this baby has been crying
[02:29:33] away you're just making it about yourself right now oh you oh you you poor parent you know meanwhile
[02:29:39] everyone you know many parents have been through the exact same thing you're making it about yourself right
[02:29:43] now you're feeling sorry whatever you know just don't make it about yourself and know that that's what
[02:29:47] you're doing if you feel that and then it's all that's exactly right check the ego yeah essentially
[02:29:53] yeah it's about the mission yeah exactly it's not about you right no that's a good one yeah that's
[02:29:58] great great advice life and uh yeah so haven't seen my kids grow up and seem about to leave the
[02:30:03] nest as they say yeah embrace that whole time and thanks obviously for coming on again
[02:30:11] I'm sure this won't be the last time and we'll we'll do it again and everyone else out there that's
[02:30:18] listening thank you all especially especially the military personnel across the globe right now
[02:30:27] by the way they're not getting to enjoy those moments with their family they're out there in
[02:30:32] harm's way standing the watch for us so thank you to all of you to the police and law enforcement

[02:31:10] need it and to the rest of you out there doing what you're doing as you go out there and do it
[02:31:22] don't do it easy don't take it easy and if someone says to you take it easy
[02:31:35] tell them no tell them you aren't gonna take it easy tell them you're gonna go hard as hard as you can
[02:31:43] tell them you're gonna push and grind and fight and work as hard as you can until you have nothing left
[02:31:55] and then turn around and walk away from that person and go do just that and do it hard
[02:32:03] and so until next time this is life and echo and jockel out
