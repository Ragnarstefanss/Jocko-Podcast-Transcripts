00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.50
This is Jocco podcast number 32 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:08.50 --> 00:00:29.90
And since Jocco podcast number 31 went long with the very heavy and dark book, we decided to end that one and not do any Q&A.

3
00:00:29.90 --> 00:00:36.90
Which means that today we have 100% Q&A for the troops.

4
00:00:36.90 --> 00:00:47.60
And obviously this comes from the questions come from you all that are listening mostly on Twitter and on Facebook is where I get these questions from.

5
00:00:47.60 --> 00:00:56.30
So thanks to everyone for submitting these questions so that we can answer them for you.

6
00:00:56.30 --> 00:01:00.30
Echo, good evening. Good evening.

7
00:01:00.30 --> 00:01:04.80
All right, for a question. I want to say I like this first question a lot.

8
00:01:04.80 --> 00:01:05.80
It's a good question.

9
00:01:05.80 --> 00:01:06.80
Nope.

10
00:01:06.80 --> 00:01:09.30
Echo approves of the first question.

11
00:01:09.30 --> 00:01:11.80
I approve most questions for sure.

12
00:01:11.80 --> 00:01:14.80
Okay, first question.

13
00:01:14.80 --> 00:01:18.80
How does one who grew up in the ghetto quote unquote,

14
00:01:18.80 --> 00:01:26.80
involved with gangs, drugs, witnessing murders and all that good stuff overcome that mentality where your guard is always up.

15
00:01:26.80 --> 00:01:30.80
Coming from a family of immigrants and growing up really poor.

16
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:32.80
We had to make a lot of sacrifices.

17
00:01:32.80 --> 00:01:39.30
And as I get older, I feel that in some of these ways, in some ways, this affects my daily life.

18
00:01:39.30 --> 00:01:47.80
I'm proud of my beginnings and I cherish my mistakes, but still even in my senior year in college, I feel some resentment towards these privileged kids who seem like they have it all.

19
00:01:47.80 --> 00:01:53.80
I really find it hard to get along with them because in a way I see them as weak.

20
00:01:53.80 --> 00:01:58.80
Because they haven't suffered through hard times or have to struggle as a minority.

21
00:01:58.80 --> 00:02:05.80
What should I do to learn to love them and respect them as equals?

22
00:02:05.80 --> 00:02:08.80
Yeah, that is a good question.

23
00:02:08.80 --> 00:02:11.80
I definitely have seen that.

24
00:02:11.80 --> 00:02:23.80
When people go through that mentality where they're having that attitude and I'll tell you, when I was a kid, I actually had a girlfriend when I was a kid.

25
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:27.80
This girl and we know in her friend was my friend as well.

26
00:02:27.80 --> 00:02:29.80
So we were all kind of friends.

27
00:02:29.80 --> 00:02:38.80
And one of the girls, one of the things that she said, which I thought was brilliant, and she said, everybody has a hard-block story.

28
00:02:38.80 --> 00:02:46.80
No matter, you go and talk to somebody, they had their struggle that they went through.

29
00:02:46.80 --> 00:02:58.80
And whether it was divorce, whether it was abuse, whether it was money struggles, whether it was fighting in the house, whether it was jail, whether there's drugs, whether it was alcoholic or workaholic or whatever.

30
00:02:58.80 --> 00:03:06.80
Whatever situation you've been in, everybody's got a hard-loxed or something that challenged them.

31
00:03:06.80 --> 00:03:10.80
And it might not be really obvious on the surface.

32
00:03:10.80 --> 00:03:21.80
I mean, you know, for instance, this question here, the fact the way that the question is phrased, you can hear he's talking about the things that we, you know, he said,

33
00:03:21.80 --> 00:03:33.80
family of immigrants growing up really poor. We had to make a lot of sacrifices, right? So right there, right there, you can see that he's got a certain amount of familial pride.

34
00:03:33.80 --> 00:03:38.80
And he's talking about his family as we and a group of being together.

35
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:45.80
And you know, that might not be money, that might not be expensive clothes, but that's an incredibly powerful thing.

36
00:03:45.80 --> 00:03:57.80
I'm trying to be lucky to have that. Now you tell me who's who's more, who has a tougher challenge. The person that grows up in a tight-knit family or everyone sticks together and everyone makes sacrifices together.

37
00:03:57.80 --> 00:04:03.80
Or the kid who grows up whose dad makes a ton of money, dad's never home.

38
00:04:03.80 --> 00:04:08.80
Dad chooses literally chooses work over the family.

39
00:04:08.80 --> 00:04:26.80
And how does that affect the kid's personality? You know, I mean, the kids kids can come from any background and end up in really tough situations with drugs, alcohol, addiction, whatever, that came from really good circumstances or really bad circumstances. It doesn't even matter. You can come from both. So,

40
00:04:26.80 --> 00:04:41.80
that's part one. Part one is like, you know, you don't know what kind of struggles other people have been through. They might have been, they might have, they might be a 22 year old senior in college driving a BMW that has more demons in their life than you do.

41
00:04:41.80 --> 00:04:52.80
So it's, it's a little bit arrogant to walk around and think that your demons are worse than in reals as demons. You just don't, you just don't know what their demons are.

42
00:04:52.80 --> 00:05:10.80
Now, on top of that, if you just want to look at like the privilege, the monetary side of it, I promise you that despite the fact that you grew up in a ghetto and you're family had to make sacrifices, there are people that year the privilege to kid.

43
00:05:10.80 --> 00:05:23.80
Because you get some kid that grew up in South America or some kid that grew up in Africa, that, you know, you think you had it tough, they didn't have a house, they, they got, you know,

44
00:05:23.80 --> 00:05:34.80
political, strife in their city, they watch their parents kick out whatever. So you're a privileged person to somebody else. So let's keep that in mind as well. And once again, you don't know what that looks like.

45
00:05:34.80 --> 00:05:49.80
You don't know what kind of struggles people have been through. So let's just try and, I'll use the term judge. Let's try and judge people not on what they are, but on who they are as a person.

46
00:05:49.80 --> 00:06:04.80
And, you know, for me, you know, you talked about the minority thing that it to me, I don't care about race, color, creed, know that stuff matters to me. I don't care about socio economic background. None of that stuff matters to me. I don't judge you on that. You know why?

47
00:06:04.80 --> 00:06:20.80
Because in the military in the SEAL teams, the, the, the good seals came from every background, every one of those backgrounds. The bad seals came from every one of those backgrounds. There was, there was kids that grew up rich with the silver spoon in their mouth.

48
00:06:20.80 --> 00:06:40.80
They were awesome seals. There were kids that grew up in the ghetto, their parents were gangbangers, awesome seals. Same as reverse is true. There was kids that grew up with the silver spoon in their mouth and went to a private school and they were horrible seals. And there was kids that grew up gangbangers and they were horrible seals. So it doesn't matter. What matters is not what you are. It's who you are as a person.

49
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:54.40
So I, yeah, I'm not going to, I'm not going to judge. And in fact, if I was to name some negative traits that do bother me, it's one of them would be judging people based on, you know, stereotypes,

50
00:06:54.40 --> 00:07:17.40
judging people, judging the book by its cover. If you're doing that, that's a negative. You know, that is a weakness. So just check yourself and realize that you don't know what people's backgrounds are. You don't know what goes on behind closed doors. You don't know what tough situation people have been through and judge them not based on that stuff. Just judge them on who they are as a person.

51
00:07:17.40 --> 00:07:29.40
Yeah, yeah, fully. And I think this kind of helps you know how, let's say like, let's say you're in a boat, right, like a row boat.

52
00:07:29.40 --> 00:07:40.40
And you're all trying to get up stream and you have all different kinds of people. And then you have weaker people and you have stronger people. And the strong person.

53
00:07:40.40 --> 00:07:51.40
And you know, when you put whether it's by his choice or not, he's strong. He can, you know, he's been working out. I don't know. He's in shape. He can roll a lot. So he went through all this sacrifice.

54
00:07:51.40 --> 00:07:58.40
But at the end, he's a stronger person. So you can look at it in a way where you now have the power.

55
00:07:58.40 --> 00:08:09.40
And you can be responsible with your power, like to help. So you have to really, it's like you have a bigger burden, but you have to embrace that not burden, but you have a bigger workload, because you're more prepared for it in life.

56
00:08:09.40 --> 00:08:21.40
Yeah, and actually speaking of that. So now that means that you have the power to to give people knowledge and perspective on what you've been through. And that's important. Now there's two ways to do that. We talk about this all the time.

57
00:08:21.40 --> 00:08:33.40
And I say, hey, you don't know what you're doing. Let me show you the correct way to film this. Let me show you the correct way to use this microphone. Right you. How would you feel about that?

58
00:08:33.40 --> 00:08:40.40
I don't know how it looked like that. You know, no, of course you wouldn't. If I came up to you and said, listen, you don't know what it's like.

59
00:08:40.40 --> 00:08:57.40
Test struggle. Are you going to be, are you going to be open to hear what I'm about to say? No, you're not. No one is. No one is, but if I said, hey man, it's really good to meet you. Oh, and then we start developing relationships. But I said, you know, it's one thing that we got to remember is what it's like for maybe some people you know when I was growing up, I had to deal with this. Oh, okay.

60
00:08:57.40 --> 00:09:12.40
Now your mind is open to it. You start learning. You start growing yourself. So by not being arrogant and by being humble and thinking that you have you may have been through worse things from then me or whatever the case may be, we're actually going to make each other better.

61
00:09:12.40 --> 00:09:26.40
And that's the goal here. So you just got to stay humble on these things and and it'll be it'll it'll work out better for you in the end. It will absolutely work out better for you in the end.

62
00:09:26.40 --> 00:09:35.40
Judge people by the content of their character. I believe is a way of putting it that makes a lot of sense to me.

63
00:09:35.40 --> 00:09:43.40
Next question. Jocco and echo. How do you guys feel about the ensigninoi situation?

64
00:09:43.40 --> 00:09:59.40
Demoting yourself after time off the mat. So this was a pretty interesting question and it's there's a guy named Insina Noi and he's a old school.

65
00:09:59.40 --> 00:10:17.40
And he's a black belt in Jocco but he fought and UFC fought in pride. He was the pseudo champion. He's just a really old school kind of OG from Hawaii, but from Hawaii.

66
00:10:17.40 --> 00:10:37.40
And just just a really well respected guy as a fighter and a guy that you know his he kind of had that warrior ethos that people talk about you know where he would say look I'm I would rather die in this fight than lose and he meant it.

67
00:10:37.40 --> 00:10:50.40
And so he's been but he moved to Japan he's of Japanese heritage and he moved to Japan a long time ago I mean I want to say 10 or maybe 15 maybe even longer.

68
00:10:50.40 --> 00:11:04.40
Yeah a long time ago he moved back to Japan he's he's you know that's where he's kind of built his life is in Japan and along the way I think his last fight was

69
00:11:04.40 --> 00:11:22.40
maybe maybe eight to 10 years ago was his last fight and since then you know there was the horrible earthquake and the tsunami in Japan and he did work as sort of a sort of a charity to raise money and help out those victims.

70
00:11:22.40 --> 00:11:34.40
So that's what he's been focused on and he's been focused on I guess his family and whatever else but in that time he he straight off the mats of justice.

71
00:11:34.40 --> 00:11:50.40
He stopped the training and and so you know he had other things going on in his life and he stopped training I don't recommend anybody stop training and but for whatever reason.

72
00:11:50.40 --> 00:12:02.40
He was talking about this he stopped training for like 10 years 10 years of no and he he said no training he just was stopped training and now oh you know he's because he's a jiu jitsu guy.

73
00:12:02.40 --> 00:12:25.40
Eventually jitsu gets back in your brain and he started getting back on the mats and when he got back on the mats he felt. That. He didn't deserve to be a black belt anymore and it wasn't just because he was his timing was off or he was out of condition he felt like jiu jitsu had had changed and he's right in the last 10 years jiu jitsu has changed a lot.

74
00:12:25.40 --> 00:12:34.40
And you know what yesterday jiu jitsu changed a lot and the day before I mean jiu jitsu changes every day every day changes I'm I'm shocked.

75
00:12:34.40 --> 00:12:38.40
Dean will come up with some new thing.

76
00:12:38.40 --> 00:12:52.40
Dean's very very good at coming up with new things and he comes up with a new thing like something I need to one of us had thought of he probably does that once or twice a month.

77
00:12:52.40 --> 00:13:05.40
He comes up with this new thing I might do it once every three to six months maybe or I go okay I found something new and I'm all excited and Dean goes well know just put your hips over there and then only so.

78
00:13:05.40 --> 00:13:17.40
It's it's just one of those things that it changes and so and so and so and so God on the mat again and said I don't I don't think I deserve to be a black belt right now and so he demoted himself back to the purple belce.

79
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:26.40
And so people's that the question is how do I feel about it. Oh and by the way since this question got asked.

80
00:13:26.40 --> 00:13:31.40
He actually reprimoted himself back to black belt.

81
00:13:31.40 --> 00:13:41.40
So and how did that go down that was John he talked to his his his instructor that gave him the black belt right John Lewis from what I understand I didn't read as much into that part of it.

82
00:13:41.40 --> 00:13:48.40
I was mainly just reading other people's takes on it you know like their reaction but which didn't go to the source material.

83
00:13:48.40 --> 00:13:50.40
Oh, it's all about the concept.

84
00:13:50.40 --> 00:13:53.40
We spoke to the source material.

85
00:13:53.40 --> 00:14:01.40
Anyway, I'm not but he had a conversation with John Lewis and John Lewis said what what was the overall do you know what he said.

86
00:14:01.40 --> 00:14:10.40
Well whatever he said I I did go to the source material and but I don't want to quote it exactly but John Lewis basically said look.

87
00:14:10.40 --> 00:14:17.40
You deserve to black belt. Oh and you know what he said he said look someone that's a doctor that became a doctor.

88
00:14:17.40 --> 00:14:23.40
And then that's not practicing but then they want to get back in the field they don't not become a doctor.

89
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:26.40
They just go and learn the new techniques and get refreshed.

90
00:14:26.40 --> 00:14:29.40
They don't have to take their doctor tag off their door.

91
00:14:29.40 --> 00:14:35.40
He said you're a doctor of the jitter you just got to get refreshed the new techniques and get back into it.

92
00:14:35.40 --> 00:14:42.40
And he said okay you know he agreed with it and he promoted himself back to black belt.

93
00:14:42.40 --> 00:14:48.40
So you know again I think from my from my perspective.

94
00:14:48.40 --> 00:14:53.40
I say good for him I think both those actions I agree with.

95
00:14:53.40 --> 00:15:02.40
I think it's actually pretty cool that he demoted himself and and said you know what I don't I don't I haven't been in the game I got out of the game.

96
00:15:02.40 --> 00:15:08.40
And I don't deserve to be a black belt right now so I'm not going to put it on I'm discracing the black belt.

97
00:15:08.40 --> 00:15:21.40
But I also see the mind flip of hey you know what I thought and trained for a giant portion of my life and I have innate knowledge that got me the black belt.

98
00:15:21.40 --> 00:15:24.40
And now I need to get back in the game but I'm still a black belt.

99
00:15:24.40 --> 00:15:35.40
I I I really respect andson I think he's a I think he's a guy with a lot of heart and pride and I respect his decision.

100
00:15:35.40 --> 00:15:37.40
I think it's pretty simple from my perspective.

101
00:15:37.40 --> 00:15:46.40
Yeah yeah that's man is one of those things where when you hear someone make a good point about one side of the whole deal.

102
00:15:46.40 --> 00:16:07.40
You're like oh yeah that's true and then you see someone else making a nice thought I was like dang that is good he that is so humble and he and he's really keeping it real he's like I'm not a black belt I'm going to I think I'm a purple belt there here's where I am and then Chris Houter who's he's you know one of the original OG and brother gay smart.

103
00:16:07.40 --> 00:16:19.40
You he said essentially kind of the same thing is as John Lewis.

104
00:16:19.40 --> 00:16:38.40
You know you're instructors you know recognize you as a black belt you are a black belt regardless and just because you jump back on the wave of jujitsu and maybe weren't as good as surfing you know you're still you're still that black belt you just got it like I said you just got to get refresh with all the new techniques if you want to you know be up to.

105
00:16:38.40 --> 00:16:50.40
You said it way more eloquently than that obviously but men reading now is like dang he's right man but but he did say that it's like it's kind of like false humility which.

106
00:16:50.40 --> 00:16:56.40
I dig pretty much everything Chris Houter has to say about you two but I couldn't really get there as far as me feeling that it was false in anyway.

107
00:16:56.40 --> 00:17:08.40
I don't I don't I don't think so either yeah I didn't feel that you know whether or not I understood exactly what because I said yeah I guess I could see what he's saying.

108
00:17:08.40 --> 00:17:31.40
I don't know if I can go where he could come to that conclusion a little bit but I don't I don't agree with that piece of it I don't because to me it's actually hey look guys I don't think there's anything false about saying hey I am not good enough to be a black belt right now so therefore I'm putting on I think I'm about purple belt level I know it feels like to be a black belt and I don't feel like one right now yeah I think that makes sense.

109
00:17:31.40 --> 00:17:42.40
I mean it does to me too and but ultimately I think it's it's however you and I think your instructors have a lot to do with it as well.

110
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:50.40
However you want to see it you know I mean I because there is a lot to be said for someone who will do that because a lot of guys they get their black belt and they're gone.

111
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:51.40
Yeah.

112
00:17:51.40 --> 00:17:52.40
Yeah.

113
00:17:52.40 --> 00:17:55.40
And somebody's doing it if they get their brown belt yeah brown belt I'm gonna brown belt.

114
00:17:55.40 --> 00:17:59.40
It does happen sometimes but it shouldn't happen at all.

115
00:17:59.40 --> 00:18:09.40
What guys get their black belt and then stop training right now a few guys like that but you know so it's like hey I got black belt and I'm not saying they chose to do that.

116
00:18:09.40 --> 00:18:19.40
The thing is yeah the thing that's weird about that the thing that makes that surprising is that it takes a lot of dedication to get your black belt and the only way you can have that much dedication is if you actually enjoy training you jitsu.

117
00:18:19.40 --> 00:18:32.40
And if you don't enjoy training jitsu then you go get your black belt why would you stop training that doesn't make sense to me it's kind of like the fact that people talk about going through seal training and they say oh do you really.

118
00:18:32.40 --> 00:18:38.40
If some if you just what if you they think if you you can make it through if you don't want to make it through.

119
00:18:38.40 --> 00:18:45.40
But truly want to make it through then guess what you're you're probably not going to make it through and it's the same thing with jitsu if you don't really enjoy it.

120
00:18:45.40 --> 00:19:00.40
If you're doing it just for the black belt it's kind of it's kind of hard to do it just for the black belt that's my point just I give you're going to go through seal training just to get your seal tried and just to claim hey I'm an AV seal if that's the only reason that you're doing it it's going to be hard for you to get through.

121
00:19:00.40 --> 00:19:14.40
So I would imagine anywhere I would guess that it wasn't their only reason but let's just say either that was a big reason to begin with or just over time that started to be the reason you know you know.

122
00:19:14.40 --> 00:19:28.40
I mean people can fall in and out of that mindset in that trap you know where it's like I just want that that belt I want to walk around and be known as a black belt or whatever and then that mindset starts to just creep in their mind and it becomes like a major part of their thinking.

123
00:19:28.40 --> 00:19:32.40
And then the thing is that they're doing it's work especially when frustration comes in and.

124
00:19:32.40 --> 00:19:57.40
That's one of the kind of cool things about no key in the idea that and everyone gives belts now with no key I mean Dean gives belts with no key I mean I support giving belts with no key even though guide never wears a key and he doesn't need a belt but you know I say all this guy's a black belt but one thing that is cool about no key and kind of especially during the during the rogue years of no key where it wasn't a thing yet and we were just doing it and there were guys at the time that we're only didn't you start off training only no key.

125
00:19:57.40 --> 00:20:07.40
Yeah, there were guys that only trained no key so it was really a real thing of the belts literally didn't matter because it didn't exist and then it was just how good are you.

126
00:20:07.40 --> 00:20:20.40
Where do you fall out on the total pull of I can tap you you can't tap me but this guy can tap me and I you know what I mean it that where there was something pretty cool about that because belts for me have never been.

127
00:20:20.40 --> 00:20:33.40
A goal or anything really to me to me I just wanted to be better at that the jitz you. Yeah, I mean but regardless that is a part of it for a lot of yeah for some people's thinking so I think.

128
00:20:33.40 --> 00:20:40.40
With that way of thinking I think I think you can be like that they'll get a black belt and finally now you get to focus on my career.

129
00:20:40.40 --> 00:20:48.40
Yeah, I'm a black belt and I would the other important thing about this is like don't stop training jitz you like don't just stop called turkey man that's not good.

130
00:20:48.40 --> 00:20:55.40
Even if you can only train a couple times a week or once even if you train once a week man train once a week you know just to keep your head in the game.

131
00:20:55.40 --> 00:21:08.40
Keep your dudes at least you can see the new moves you can see where things are developing maybe that'll ignite your desire to get back on the map more but don't stop training you know and even on the days when you don't want to there's one day where you don't want to train.

132
00:21:08.40 --> 00:21:10.40
Go train that day.

133
00:21:10.40 --> 00:21:28.40
Yeah, you know yeah and go train that day. What it does to a big part of it. It keeps your body in tune with the jitz and movement is the general movement because that's what one of the things that Enson said where he was like my body wasn't moving the same it wasn't moving and it's one thing to be like okay I'm getting older I'm less mobile but.

134
00:21:28.40 --> 00:21:36.40
Negative jitz and move we don't know anything about that but jitz movement is a certain kind of movement that develops just kind of naturally.

135
00:21:36.40 --> 00:21:51.40
Yeah, you know when you're rolling all the time and if you lose that 10 years I could see you lose that so it's like dang my hip escape is really labored right now and I just it's hard to do when it's so easy to do normally you know so you know I can I can understand see that.

136
00:21:51.40 --> 00:22:07.40
But yeah, this really goes with anything anything that you're doing like any you know you find this also is people that are in business that whatever whatever level they advanced out of.

137
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:20.40
And they move out of a technical position and they move up to a management position don't just walk away completely from the technical side like just go go do it once a week go get in the game make sure that you still understand so that you stay.

138
00:22:20.40 --> 00:22:30.40
So you stay in the game and you don't lose you don't wake up because you were a black belt that's why you got promoted above into management position you were a black belt in that technical side and they saw potential for you.

139
00:22:30.40 --> 00:22:39.40
And you walk away from it when you move up don't just walk away completely stay in the game go do you know if you're in the military just because you got promoted to.

140
00:22:39.40 --> 00:23:04.40
And you never a company commander or a staff guy on the battalion don't just say well I'm never going to go in the kill house again no no no go in the kill house even if you can only do it once every week or or maybe once a month you just get to go and and keep your head in the game you've got to do that so you stay fresh you stay like you said you keep that mental game there whereas if you just walk away.

141
00:23:04.40 --> 00:23:13.40
And when I would have guys that were senior to me come out and go through little blocks of training with us maybe they come out and go to the kill house with us for a day they didn't know what they were doing.

142
00:23:13.40 --> 00:23:14.40
They didn't know what they were doing.

143
00:23:14.40 --> 00:23:21.40
Part of was because they walked away for too long but even when they didn't know what they were doing you still like hey man good for him for coming out.

144
00:23:21.40 --> 00:23:30.40
You know it wasn't like you said oh look at him he doesn't know I don't respect him no you're actually actually the opposite is true you'd say oh man props props to the boss here for coming out and getting after it with the boys for a day.

145
00:23:30.40 --> 00:23:39.40
Yeah he doesn't know what he's doing but maybe we can help him and if they had that mentality the whole time because it's pretty it's a lot easier to maintain a scale than it is to learn it.

146
00:23:39.40 --> 00:23:46.40
Yeah so all you have to do you're a black belt man get on the map once a week you know just just get in there and roll some people roll them up.

147
00:23:46.40 --> 00:23:59.40
Yeah but I back to the end and I dig it either way I even dig it that he did it and then really took some peer review and it was like hey I maybe didn't look at it this way.

148
00:23:59.40 --> 00:24:01.40
There's an open minded dish making process.

149
00:24:01.40 --> 00:24:15.40
Yeah you went back in went to the source to his instructor yeah we support the other day back to the instructor and he was like hey and he was like yes yes sir you know that's kind of where it all came from and he went back to black belt even that again help but respect you know.

150
00:24:15.40 --> 00:24:29.40
The whole situation and what if this is like a whole side note what if what if you go like I'll give you your back to Fabio right no Dean let's be okay so let's say you took 10 years off you came back and roll with Dean.

151
00:24:29.40 --> 00:24:37.40
Oh no Dean was like bro I am you're in instructor I'm taking your belt I'm giving you a purple belt that would be awesome.

152
00:24:37.40 --> 00:24:48.40
But like is that is that like you know as far as like can you do that or what I do how do you feel about that I don't know but that would be very cool to see that happen.

153
00:24:48.40 --> 00:25:02.40
Even just even just oh you want to hear you're in an old school story an old school GJ2 story of course okay this is awesome so back in the day back in the day I was a blue belt.

154
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:12.40
Dean was I think Dean was a blue belt too he might have been a purple belt and there was another person that was a blue belt at the time my wife.

155
00:25:12.40 --> 00:25:17.40
Your wife of the blue belt and she was good she's a really good athlete.

156
00:25:17.40 --> 00:25:18.40
Is that how you met your wife?

157
00:25:18.40 --> 00:25:22.40
No she was I'm posed GJ2 upon her one.

158
00:25:22.40 --> 00:25:37.40
So you know it was all good and we were training with Fabio and Fabio was no five Fabio's great instructor and we were at the Academy one day and there's a guy from out of town and he's a purple belt.

159
00:25:37.40 --> 00:25:44.40
So you know purple belt you know you figure the guys good but this is back in the day to this isn't in the mid 90s so probably like 90.

160
00:25:44.40 --> 00:26:00.40
I'll see 96 and so this guy comes in from out of town and you know there wasn't that many GJ2 schools in San Diego there was like two right it was that it was Fabio there was Rodrigo think that was it at the time.

161
00:26:00.40 --> 00:26:13.40
So anyways this guy comes in he's kind of a piece probably 35 years old probably 150 pounds purple belt so you know we're rolling and we're a little bit like okay the guys are probably about.

162
00:26:13.40 --> 00:26:25.40
But there's that attitude of the guys know the guy knows what he's doing so I didn't roll them but I'm watching him I'm rolling Dean we're doing our thing and it's kind of the open not period and.

163
00:26:25.40 --> 00:26:34.40
And Fabio has him roll with my wife and so my wife you know she's good she's but she's a.

164
00:26:34.40 --> 00:26:52.40
They're rolling and he gets her in a choke he gets her in a rear naked choke and she berries her chin like a white belt like a like a defense you know I'm very much in so he's not going to talk me he chokes her face like I'm talking legit gets after it.

165
00:26:52.40 --> 00:27:07.40
It's and she starts crying and a little bit of blood and she says okay so so I'm just like and so I hear her scream or whatever and then I then.

166
00:27:07.40 --> 00:27:21.40
And then she gets up and he lets go and he's kind of like oh sorry bubble wall and Fabio looks at me goes and the guy didn't notice my wife.

167
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:25.40
Fabio goes fabulous juggle you roll with him now and I go okay so even I.

168
00:27:25.40 --> 00:27:41.40
I was like okay I'm gonna smash him but I didn't intentionally like a soul to him I just smashed him I mean I crushed him and submitted him but I didn't like break his arm.

169
00:27:41.40 --> 00:27:55.40
And but I smashed him and I was doing a lot of knee and stomach at the at the time so I was just driving no dude it was like an early version of the park bench.

170
00:27:55.40 --> 00:28:13.40
And then I get done and I wore him out pretty good and Fabio is like now I will roll with you and Fabio tore him up and was like cracking arm bars on him and joking him and smashing him.

171
00:28:13.40 --> 00:28:41.40
And then the guy's like the guy's like broken down and Fabio is Fabio said you're not a purple belt and I can't remember if he took his purple belt but he kicked him out and he said don't ever come back here and you're not a purple belt and I think he took his purple belt and said you're not a purple belt no you know he's he also said I've one thing I remember him saying is like this girl's been training here for two and a half years she's never been hurt she's never had a problem you come in here and hurt this girl.

172
00:28:41.40 --> 00:28:47.40
And I'm not a purple belt you know what you're doing give me a purple belt yeah so that was a cool demotion yeah.

173
00:28:47.40 --> 00:28:55.40
courtesy of Fabio Santos Old School due to right there so yeah thank yeah that's yeah different situation though.

174
00:28:55.40 --> 00:29:07.40
Yeah so it is a different situation but but I think I don't know maybe we need to see more demotions in due to that's a possibility maybe I need to get started on that to vote myself right now.

175
00:29:07.40 --> 00:29:23.40
So alright that's awesome but yeah old school due to your father yeah but it's kind of interesting though right because it that kind of falls the same in the same way like in the same line is is that acceptable for a professor to demote their student if they lost the step.

176
00:29:23.40 --> 00:29:35.40
But or once you earn that that black belt or the what ever the belt is once you earn it it's like you paid those dues yeah that's you know it's hard to afford it.

177
00:29:35.40 --> 00:29:45.40
Yeah just thing I don't know I think I might be wrong in terms of the way people view it but I think demotion is kind of cool.

178
00:29:45.40 --> 00:29:55.40
I think I think more demotions need to happen like oh you haven't been coming to the gym for two years cool get give me a round belt you know the link they man's sorry you know.

179
00:29:55.40 --> 00:29:57.40
Yeah no one's ever going to come to my academy.

180
00:29:57.40 --> 00:30:05.40
Yeah I wouldn't say that that could be the case if the reason like if you're if you're this highly competitive.

181
00:30:05.40 --> 00:30:22.40
So philosophy type team where you if you go out in the term you have to represent and that was the culture real rigid like that thing yeah but you know you just you for life you know you can take 10 years off you just who's kind of part of you or whatever you were awarded this belt through your time.

182
00:30:22.40 --> 00:30:27.40
Yeah maybe your efforts and stuff like that then it's like now I got to worry about all my time and effort.

183
00:30:27.40 --> 00:30:31.40
Yeah that would scare people off that they go like on right go back because I don't want to get demoted.

184
00:30:31.40 --> 00:30:35.40
Yeah exactly how I got to do that I earn it back.

185
00:30:35.40 --> 00:30:47.40
Yeah but like I said if there was a job that you had to do basically it's like if you have a job to do as a brown belt you have to represent you know like in a company or something you can be the director of sales.

186
00:30:47.40 --> 00:30:55.40
Get that job and then now you're performing sucks you know you can't be remit because you have a job to do but like I said you just is not really a job where.

187
00:30:55.40 --> 00:31:01.40
I don't know I mean when you're a brown belt in a school you have to go and help train the other people that's part of your job right.

188
00:31:01.40 --> 00:31:03.40
Yeah yeah you have to show up and train with me.

189
00:31:03.40 --> 00:31:13.40
Right yeah for sure and yeah if you're violating some you know some ethics or something like that then I mean even then you don't really take away the belt you take away their whole.

190
00:31:13.40 --> 00:31:21.40
Yeah yeah but I think so so the bottom line is although I think demotions would be cool I don't think it's probably going to happen.

191
00:31:21.40 --> 00:31:27.40
And I think that the I think that's tradition because although I do believe I think demotions a good idea.

192
00:31:27.40 --> 00:31:33.40
I also do like some of the traditional aspects of the jets and one of the traditional aspects is when you get a belt your belt.

193
00:31:33.40 --> 00:31:36.40
Yeah you did it you put it all that time all that effort all that knowledge.

194
00:31:36.40 --> 00:31:38.40
Alright you get to keep your belt people.

195
00:31:38.40 --> 00:31:40.40
Barely.

196
00:31:40.40 --> 00:31:43.40
But here's the thing I think that's interesting about.

197
00:31:43.40 --> 00:31:48.40
You know it's funny is that the gym I will shout out things like like take that guy's brown belt.

198
00:31:48.40 --> 00:31:50.40
Yeah yeah.

199
00:31:50.40 --> 00:31:52.40
I'm going to get you to a brown belt.

200
00:31:52.40 --> 00:31:54.40
Yeah or.

201
00:31:54.40 --> 00:31:56.40
I'm kind of an instigator.

202
00:31:56.40 --> 00:31:58.40
Yeah I like that.

203
00:31:58.40 --> 00:32:01.40
I like that that that's part of our fun culture where you can say.

204
00:32:01.40 --> 00:32:03.40
Or if you roll with it let's say like.

205
00:32:03.40 --> 00:32:09.40
I'll do this with like my friends or whatever they're a brown belt and I and it's you know same belt is you and you get them.

206
00:32:09.40 --> 00:32:16.40
And you get them like kind of easier with the new move or something that's a flash your something you take their belt and say like you don't deserve that right now.

207
00:32:16.40 --> 00:32:19.42
We're gonna roll in the camera about you know, but it's a joke

208
00:32:20.26 --> 00:32:23.20
But I think that that's kind of what's in our minds anyway

209
00:32:23.36 --> 00:32:28.38
So let's say guy rolls in he's a brown belt then he's getting smashed or whatever my like purple belt

210
00:32:28.38 --> 00:32:31.44
Yeah, that's one of the best things about you, Jitsu is that the belt

211
00:32:32.48 --> 00:32:34.38
It doesn't really mean anything right?

212
00:32:34.38 --> 00:32:37.36
If you if you're a black belt and you come in there getting smashed by blue belts

213
00:32:37.36 --> 00:32:41.16
No one's sitting there thinking wow he's a black belt. There's thinking no. There's something wrong with him

214
00:32:41.16 --> 00:32:45.76
Yeah, exactly right no black belt here. Yeah, so that's one of the best things about you Jitsu

215
00:32:45.76 --> 00:32:49.26
Is the truth is on the map. So I guess it doesn't you don't need to get demoted

216
00:32:49.42 --> 00:32:53.12
Right your mere existence is a emotion if you're not if you're not training right?

217
00:32:53.12 --> 00:32:58.66
So like I'd like he goes back to what I was saying where you put in all that time because really the belt is based on specific things

218
00:32:58.66 --> 00:33:03.84
And those things if you've done those things you've taken the time is one of them the knowledge

219
00:33:04.24 --> 00:33:08.32
The you know understanding of all this all basically all all that the belt is based on

220
00:33:08.72 --> 00:33:13.04
That doesn't really go it you put in that time you have that image. You know

221
00:33:13.04 --> 00:33:16.56
All right, I think I go scared I'm gonna take his belt away

222
00:33:18.44 --> 00:33:20.64
Or maybe I'll take your belt to bring it

223
00:33:21.52 --> 00:33:24.72
They just gonna be about a 45 second break in the podcast right now

224
00:33:28.04 --> 00:33:31.76
All right next question dead horse go

225
00:33:32.36 --> 00:33:34.36
Choco

226
00:33:34.36 --> 00:33:36.36
What do I say to someone

227
00:33:36.36 --> 00:33:39.68
I've trained and later claims this person claims

228
00:33:39.68 --> 00:33:43.04
That a certain thing was not covered in the training

229
00:33:45.60 --> 00:33:52.04
In addition to the questions is obviously excuses obviously excuses. So this is a this is a really

230
00:33:53.20 --> 00:33:55.84
Pretty common question of how do you handle these situations?

231
00:33:55.84 --> 00:34:00.92
And I've actually been lucky enough in my life to run a lot of training into a lot of different situations mostly in the military

232
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:03.68
and I've absolutely had this happen and

233
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:10.000
There's one thing that I do when this happens and you can probably guess what it is

234
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
I take ownership of it

235
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.32
So check it out if somebody comes to me and says oh you're supposed to train us on X

236
00:34:16.80 --> 00:34:21.84
And you didn't and I know that I did and it was in the curriculum and we covered it. I say I don't say no

237
00:34:21.84 --> 00:34:23.84
I trained you and I hear it is no I said okay

238
00:34:24.88 --> 00:34:26.88
Let's get it trained then what do I got to do?

239
00:34:26.88 --> 00:34:31.36
We hear it is when we redo the curriculum. Let me show it to you again because here's the thing as a trainer

240
00:34:31.36 --> 00:34:37.28
It's not just your job and this would I should tell my guys when I ran training the guys that were being struck through

241
00:34:37.28 --> 00:34:42.64
Contry I'd say listen it isn't your job just to run the training just to provide the training

242
00:34:43.04 --> 00:34:47.20
It is your job to ensure that the training is absorbed

243
00:34:48.72 --> 00:34:52.32
That's the difference that's a big difference between philosophies of training

244
00:34:52.32 --> 00:34:57.28
I at my goal when I'm training someone is to make sure that the training is absorbed into the mind

245
00:34:57.92 --> 00:34:59.68
Otherwise go watch a YouTube video

246
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:01.68
Because the YouTube video you can see the same instruction

247
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:03.84
But no I

248
00:35:03.84 --> 00:35:06.72
Need to seek you out and say okay

249
00:35:07.44 --> 00:35:13.12
Where did you miss it weird and also where did I fail in my training if I covered it? Why don't you remember it?

250
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:17.68
Yeah, that means I didn't cover it well enough right didn't teach it well enough and I think that

251
00:35:19.20 --> 00:35:24.56
You you then you retrain them you get them up to speed at some point. They're gonna realize that you did train them

252
00:35:24.56 --> 00:35:26.56
I mean if they truly forgot or

253
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:30.08
Or even if they didn't forget but they're just placed in the blame on you

254
00:35:30.08 --> 00:35:34.32
They're gonna realize that you know they're gonna know that you know that you trained them

255
00:35:34.80 --> 00:35:39.76
When they when you reflect on the same information and do to again so

256
00:35:40.56 --> 00:35:42.56
I think it's a pretty simple answer

257
00:35:42.96 --> 00:35:44.72
When someone

258
00:35:44.72 --> 00:35:49.28
Is saying you haven't trained them take responsibility for take ownership for it and say okay

259
00:35:49.28 --> 00:35:52.000
Look, but let me get you trained on it my my apologies

260
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.68
I'm here to train you let me make sure that I train you and make sure that you absorb it

261
00:35:55.68 --> 00:36:00.40
Yeah, let's go. I think that your way of training should

262
00:36:01.60 --> 00:36:03.60
be

263
00:36:04.48 --> 00:36:10.000
Done or performed with kids as well like parents with their kids you know how you because you know how the

264
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.60
Kid the kids miss behaving and the parents like I don't know why he does that I told him not to pitch a fit

265
00:36:15.60 --> 00:36:19.76
Well, yeah, I know you probably told him or you went through the motions of telling them or whatever

266
00:36:19.76 --> 00:36:23.28
But man you got it you got to train them and make sure that's absorbed, you know

267
00:36:23.84 --> 00:36:24.88
Absolutely

268
00:36:24.88 --> 00:36:29.84
And I always kind of think of it this way not kind of I really think of it this way where if

269
00:36:30.64 --> 00:36:37.44
Your kid is misbehaving it's something you did or didn't of course, so you can't really sit there and be like

270
00:36:38.72 --> 00:36:43.04
Believing the kid for misbehaving or whatever or yeah, you know your you're right

271
00:36:43.04 --> 00:36:48.64
I wonder isn't it weird that you can have families where one kid can go to

272
00:36:48.64 --> 00:36:55.28
You go to high school and do well and do great on their SATs and get new great college and go to

273
00:36:56.16 --> 00:37:01.52
And go be a doctor and the other kid can become a heroin addict. You is not strange

274
00:37:02.08 --> 00:37:07.60
It's interesting, but I and I think a long time ago I would talk to you about this like long time ago

275
00:37:07.60 --> 00:37:12.40
And how do we blame the parents and well that's the thing that's the that's not what I'm saying

276
00:37:12.40 --> 00:37:16.64
I'm not saying blame the parents I'm not saying that because because that would that if you're blaming them

277
00:37:16.64 --> 00:37:20.16
That's like saying it's so easy why don't you do that I blame you you know kind of things not easy

278
00:37:20.32 --> 00:37:27.92
I'd rather so many different dynamics to every kids experience so you know how and this is how the conversation kind of if I remember correctly

279
00:37:27.92 --> 00:37:31.60
Kind of started when you were like hey, I have you know four kids or whatever and

280
00:37:32.24 --> 00:37:33.52
They're just different

281
00:37:33.52 --> 00:37:34.56
They are all true

282
00:37:34.56 --> 00:37:39.52
Then I said this before had kids by the way, so you weren't really doing it

283
00:37:39.52 --> 00:37:42.96
Yeah, you didn't you didn't you didn't really care about that

284
00:37:42.96 --> 00:37:44.24
Well, not the safety

285
00:37:44.24 --> 00:37:46.56
What is that anyway, I said I said

286
00:37:51.20 --> 00:37:53.60
Okay, yeah, it's kind of complicated so

287
00:37:55.20 --> 00:38:01.92
Kids are different yeah, but they're not just different like that's not it. That's nature and nature. Yes, yes

288
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:02.96
fully so

289
00:38:02.96 --> 00:38:06.08
Consider every kid's starting point is different

290
00:38:06.48 --> 00:38:12.40
So you can't expect everyone every kid's ending point to be the same even though they go through the same experience

291
00:38:12.40 --> 00:38:18.48
True just being the second born you're starting out as a completely different human being right just being

292
00:38:19.04 --> 00:38:23.68
Two years one year five years younger than your older brother. So those minor variables

293
00:38:24.40 --> 00:38:26.80
End up creating some major

294
00:38:26.80 --> 00:38:31.04
differences. Yes, of course. So at certain points in development they're gonna have

295
00:38:31.92 --> 00:38:37.84
Kind of the same needs but in a different environment so the way that you fulfill those same needs with the first kid

296
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:43.84
Are gonna look different as far as them being translated with the second kid and the third kid and the for you know

297
00:38:43.84 --> 00:38:49.84
How many kids you have so you have to make slight adaptations to what you did to the second kid in the first and

298
00:38:49.84 --> 00:38:53.84
To keep a handle of all those dynamics is it's hard. So that's why it's like

299
00:38:53.84 --> 00:38:56.32
Yeah, not only that it's not an exact science

300
00:38:57.04 --> 00:39:01.20
Yeah, and in the way kids react away people

301
00:39:01.20 --> 00:39:05.68
It's not just we're not just talking about kids here. We're talking about people because you get different people

302
00:39:05.68 --> 00:39:09.76
At you hire at different times a different people that join Patuens at different times and they have a different attitudes

303
00:39:09.76 --> 00:39:16.48
So yeah, you know just but the bottom line is the thing that remains constant through all this is that if you're trying to

304
00:39:16.64 --> 00:39:19.68
Import knowledge on people you need to take responsibility

305
00:39:20.08 --> 00:39:26.24
Not just for showing them the knowledge but to making sure that they absorb the knowledge and the primary methodology of doing that is by

306
00:39:26.24 --> 00:39:31.68
Explaining to people why they're doing what they're doing and why you're telling them this and why this

307
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:37.20
A curse so if like you said you tell your kid don't have a temper tantrum and

308
00:39:37.92 --> 00:39:42.16
Then you never explain to them here's why you don't want to have a temper tantrum when you're doing this

309
00:39:42.40 --> 00:39:45.92
You can hurt yourself you can hurt other people you're gonna do things that regret you can

310
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:50.56
To break something in the house. I can't control you. I can't bring you anywhere if you're gonna act like this

311
00:39:50.56 --> 00:39:57.36
That means we can't go out and have fun. So you got to explain why and once you explain why then people have a better chance of absorbing the information

312
00:39:57.36 --> 00:40:04.000
But yes, you as a trainer parent leader teacher has the responsibility not just to impart knowledge

313
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.56
But to ensure that the knowledge is absorbed. Yeah, rant complete

314
00:40:10.32 --> 00:40:12.96
Well, but and of course like I said

315
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:17.60
It's for parenting. It's not like just that easy, you know, no

316
00:40:17.60 --> 00:40:21.84
They parenting is very difficult leadership situation. So it's really a lot like blinker

317
00:40:23.44 --> 00:40:26.000
Consider you know, I mean you started a different point

318
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.20
In all these variables. Oh, but yeah, there you go

319
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:33.60
So next question

320
00:40:34.80 --> 00:40:36.80
Jocco yes in the seal teams

321
00:40:37.92 --> 00:40:45.84
You let all male teams any leadership difference in business in the business world with mixed gender or female teams

322
00:40:46.96 --> 00:40:48.48
So

323
00:40:48.48 --> 00:40:52.000
First of all in the military I did work with women there's there's no women in seal teams

324
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.92
But there's women that are in tell there's women that are in logistics there's women in the in the

325
00:40:56.72 --> 00:41:01.20
Some of the logistics support units that go out in the field sometimes so

326
00:41:01.84 --> 00:41:06.08
Definitely worked with women in the military and in the civilian sector

327
00:41:06.80 --> 00:41:11.84
With with echelon front I work with all kinds of women all kinds of women in every level from

328
00:41:12.48 --> 00:41:19.36
CEOs on down to front line troopers and here's the deal for me. It's no factor no factor to me

329
00:41:19.36 --> 00:41:22.16
What's a factor to me is?

330
00:41:22.96 --> 00:41:28.96
Can they do their job? Do they have an open mind? Are they humble? Do they treat people with respect those are the kind of things that

331
00:41:29.68 --> 00:41:30.64
I'm

332
00:41:30.64 --> 00:41:32.64
Judging

333
00:41:32.64 --> 00:41:37.12
It's like what we talked about earlier. I'm judging but I'm not judging based on

334
00:41:38.24 --> 00:41:41.44
What they are I'm judging on who they are and who they are as a person. So

335
00:41:42.72 --> 00:41:47.04
That's I see no real difference the leadership

336
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:49.04
The

337
00:41:49.04 --> 00:41:54.08
Way that you lead doesn't change in my opinion from the women of scene in leadership positions

338
00:41:55.12 --> 00:42:02.24
To the men of scene in leadership positions the the way they lead is successful because the way they lead not because they're male or female

339
00:42:02.96 --> 00:42:07.04
And you know some of the stereotypes that that you might see out there

340
00:42:07.04 --> 00:42:16.96
Like like like like for instance men or tougher than women or men or women or women are more emotional than men

341
00:42:17.36 --> 00:42:20.32
That's just garbage and if you see I've seen

342
00:42:21.20 --> 00:42:23.44
At least when you get to a leadership position

343
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:29.04
I've definitely seen women that were way tougher than then guys were in terms of hey we got to make this move for the company

344
00:42:29.12 --> 00:42:34.88
Here's what I'm gonna do boom they executed and I've seen men that were way too emotional and attached to

345
00:42:34.88 --> 00:42:42.80
Is this scenario and ruin it because they're just the way more emotional than the stereotypical woman might be so that's why I just didn't think you can trust them

346
00:42:42.80 --> 00:42:48.08
I look at a person I weathered a man or woman. I'm looking at their the content of their character for the second time

347
00:42:48.08 --> 00:42:50.08
I'll say that today mlk

348
00:42:51.92 --> 00:42:53.12
And

349
00:42:53.12 --> 00:42:54.16
Now

350
00:42:54.16 --> 00:42:56.16
When we start talking about combat

351
00:42:56.88 --> 00:43:03.28
There's some physical differences that make that make a definite impact and I talked about on the Tim Kennedy if you want to hear a hear me talk about that

352
00:43:03.28 --> 00:43:05.28
Because

353
00:43:05.28 --> 00:43:12.16
Yeah, when you get into some physical things men are stronger than women and so there's some physical limitations there

354
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:17.60
But in terms of leadership capabilities in this in this civilian sector there's

355
00:43:18.40 --> 00:43:24.64
Yeah, I'm not I'm not I'm not worried about men and women. Do you know okay? Are there some nuances there?

356
00:43:25.84 --> 00:43:29.36
There are there are new as for instance who like one you'll hear is um

357
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:32.88
I'll get asked you know I'm a female and I'm in charge of these guys

358
00:43:34.16 --> 00:43:37.12
You know how should I act or what should I do?

359
00:43:37.52 --> 00:43:41.28
Because they they might not like working for for a girl

360
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:47.84
And I say they probably that that guy probably wouldn't like working for a guy either or a free younger guy or for a guy that got moved from another

361
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:50.16
Department there's it's the same thing

362
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:56.24
It's the same thing so what are you gonna do the same thing always say be humble listen what they have to say keep an open mind

363
00:43:56.24 --> 00:44:04.24
That's what you're gonna do regardless male female whatever it just yeah older younger doesn't matter you want it the being a good leader the principles don't change

364
00:44:06.08 --> 00:44:08.08
That's all there is to it

365
00:44:08.08 --> 00:44:11.52
Yeah, because in as an insecure guy

366
00:44:12.64 --> 00:44:13.84
Getting sitting

367
00:44:13.84 --> 00:44:19.28
Getting led or or or a girl calling shots or whatever will affect them

368
00:44:20.56 --> 00:44:24.32
But like I said if they if their leadership principles are sound

369
00:44:24.32 --> 00:44:26.32
Yeah, doesn't matter making the right call

370
00:44:26.88 --> 00:44:32.72
It's gonna be obvious and that like that guy's messing up or you know like he's he's

371
00:44:33.68 --> 00:44:40.08
Acting out of insecurity or not acting out of insecurity. It's gonna be obvious the leadership part as long as that sound

372
00:44:41.04 --> 00:44:43.04
It's you're gonna have success

373
00:44:43.04 --> 00:44:45.04
Yeah, yeah

374
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:48.32
So yeah, I'm that's no factor to me

375
00:44:48.32 --> 00:44:50.32
Yeah

376
00:44:52.56 --> 00:44:54.56
Next question

377
00:44:54.56 --> 00:44:59.60
There maybe I should bring some of the female leaders that I've worked with on the podcast

378
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:02.08
You know the thing the problem with that is

379
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:07.76
There are no different than the male leaders of work. I'm sure that there's some some women who listen this and they go oh

380
00:45:07.76 --> 00:45:10.24
You don't know how hard it is when X

381
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.96
Oh, you don't know I

382
00:45:12.96 --> 00:45:17.36
But that's what I'm saying like the good female leaders of work with have been like oh yeah

383
00:45:17.36 --> 00:45:20.64
That can be sometimes a problem because I'm a woman and here's what I do didn't engage it because

384
00:45:21.28 --> 00:45:25.60
I guess what the next day I'll be working with a different client and the it's a man and he goes well

385
00:45:25.60 --> 00:45:28.72
You know I have to deal with X and this is how I mitigate it so everyone's dealing with X

386
00:45:29.28 --> 00:45:31.36
Everyone's got some factor that they're trying to overcome

387
00:45:31.92 --> 00:45:38.72
And it's just a good leader will find a way around that factor or find a way to mitigate that factor and a bad leader won't

388
00:45:38.72 --> 00:45:41.36
And will then use that factor as an excuse

389
00:45:42.48 --> 00:45:44.48
Rather than just as an advantage

390
00:45:44.48 --> 00:45:50.000
You know there's a huge difference between taking ownership of these problems and saying oh you know what here's the issue?

391
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.84
Okay, I'm gonna own that and I'm gonna take care of it. I'm gonna find a way around it instead of saying oh

392
00:45:54.72 --> 00:46:00.48
I'm younger. I'm older. I'm a woman. I'm a man trying to lead these what it's just like no

393
00:46:01.04 --> 00:46:07.12
You're you're a human leading another human being and so step up and lead figure out what the issues are and overcome them

394
00:46:07.12 --> 00:46:09.12
Yeah

395
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:14.96
Jockel

396
00:46:15.60 --> 00:46:20.32
I've taken a lot of inspiration from your philosophy of good

397
00:46:21.92 --> 00:46:24.96
How do you apply this without succumbing to polyanism?

398
00:46:25.92 --> 00:46:27.76
Did I say that right? Yeah, so

399
00:46:29.04 --> 00:46:33.52
Polyanish is is a term and it actually comes from a

400
00:46:33.52 --> 00:46:35.52
from a novel

401
00:46:37.20 --> 00:46:38.40
From

402
00:46:38.40 --> 00:46:40.88
basically early 1900s, but it it

403
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:49.28
The name of the novel is polyan. And anyways, Polyan and the book has this really super positive attitude and it's almost so positive that

404
00:46:50.48 --> 00:46:54.16
It it overwhelms and it kind of changes people's attitudes in the town, but

405
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:58.72
There's a pejorative meaning of this word which is what this guy's asking about and

406
00:46:58.72 --> 00:47:03.44
And it is that is when when someone is like so positive that they

407
00:47:05.20 --> 00:47:14.000
That they freaking about reality of a situation you know and so that's that can be absolutely problematic and

408
00:47:15.12 --> 00:47:17.36
That is not what I'm telling anybody to do

409
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:20.16
in fact

410
00:47:19.92 --> 00:47:21.92
the let's

411
00:47:21.92 --> 00:47:25.52
Let's not mistake the the good philosophy as

412
00:47:25.52 --> 00:47:32.08
one that negates reality that is totally off. That's not what I'm telling anyone to do. In fact

413
00:47:32.08 --> 00:47:34.08
the very first thing you have to do

414
00:47:34.72 --> 00:47:38.40
Is accept reality. That's the first thing you got to do you got to look at what's happening?

415
00:47:40.48 --> 00:47:42.48
You got to assess it

416
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:50.08
assess the reality of it and then you say okay good now instead of dwelling on the negatives and what's gonna go bad and what's wrong?

417
00:47:50.16 --> 00:47:52.64
You deal with them, but then you look at okay

418
00:47:52.64 --> 00:47:58.40
You know what are we gonna do positive out of this what good's gonna come out of this and that's that's all it is

419
00:47:58.48 --> 00:48:03.68
It's definitely not denying or being delusional about the situation by any stretch

420
00:48:04.08 --> 00:48:07.04
But it is also not being woe is me

421
00:48:07.76 --> 00:48:13.92
In all this happened and now oh my gosh everything's going horrible. I'm doomed. No that's that's not what I'm talking about

422
00:48:14.48 --> 00:48:18.64
Obviously I'm not talking about that and it's also not like it's okay everything's wonderful

423
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:25.04
No, that's why the term is good and not wonderful right? I'm not saying everything's wonderful, but good

424
00:48:25.52 --> 00:48:28.88
Okay, now what are we gonna find out of this? What are we gonna figure out of this? What are we gonna make happen now?

425
00:48:29.52 --> 00:48:34.80
Because I'm gonna deal with reality. I'm gonna accept reality. I'm going to accept reality. I'm going to accept reality

426
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:39.60
Then there's some people that you know like the the self-help goods that are like no

427
00:48:40.16 --> 00:48:45.36
I'm just not going to accept that. I'm it's not gonna happen. I'm gonna be so positive

428
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:50.56
That I'm gonna get that million dollars tomorrow. No, no actually you're not gonna get that million dollars tomorrow

429
00:48:50.56 --> 00:48:53.12
You're gonna have to work. You're gonna have to work for a long time

430
00:48:53.12 --> 00:48:56.72
You're gonna have to work hard. You're gonna have to stay focused on your goals and then you're gonna get you million dollars

431
00:48:57.84 --> 00:49:01.84
Good. It's heel strong. You are yes. Yes, so

432
00:49:02.64 --> 00:49:07.04
That's a deal of reality except reality then find the good at it and move

433
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:09.84
Oh, Lord

434
00:49:09.84 --> 00:49:13.92
That's a cool video by the way that you mean you

435
00:49:16.24 --> 00:49:21.12
Like that video. You know I do I think is that you're fishing for a compliment?

436
00:49:23.12 --> 00:49:26.72
That video is a video I spend a lot of people watch that video

437
00:49:27.28 --> 00:49:31.92
It's interesting too because you made that video and you made another video

438
00:49:32.16 --> 00:49:38.32
Where does discipline come from and I actually first thing I like the weirdest discipline come from video better

439
00:49:38.32 --> 00:49:45.76
But the good video it just strikes court with people right the act because I think I think because it applies so

440
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
universally to

441
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.88
negativity in the world like okay the up these bad things are happening right now. In fact, I get so much feedback

442
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:55.60
of people that literally say

443
00:49:56.16 --> 00:50:04.24
You know, thank you for introducing me to that idea that philosophy because it's changed my attitude and now when things go wrong

444
00:50:04.24 --> 00:50:06.24
I say good now what I'm gonna do about it

445
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:13.52
Right so yeah, that's why that video is is quite popular that and the unbelievable editing that was done

446
00:50:13.52 --> 00:50:18.40
whatever was put together yeah sure yeah and it it does seem like a real

447
00:50:19.68 --> 00:50:20.96
like

448
00:50:20.80 --> 00:50:25.68
personal like deeply personal thing like because it it's like it's more

449
00:50:26.64 --> 00:50:33.76
It's not this like sensationalization of it. It's just it's real kind of kind of dark whatever and like how you said like the negative part of it

450
00:50:33.76 --> 00:50:39.92
It's like I said this last time or it's a painkiller to that a multivitamin you know what did me by that meaning

451
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:43.36
If you say that before me like if you have a problem you you know

452
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:49.28
Just in nature when you when you're going along what are your brain is is evolved to to recognize

453
00:50:49.44 --> 00:50:55.84
Problems and if something isn't a problem it'll start to filter that out that's just how you brain is okay

454
00:50:55.84 --> 00:51:01.60
So in life when you have problems that's what's always on the radar now you have this little

455
00:51:01.60 --> 00:51:06.16
Personal like tool that's talking you of how to deal with those problems. Nice. You know what I mean?

456
00:51:06.16 --> 00:51:10.80
So so it's it's kind of that like the discipline where does this link come from?

457
00:51:10.80 --> 00:51:15.52
It's kind of that's more starts to go into the multivitamin thing where it's like this not a big problem

458
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.84
I'm gonna try to recognize it as a problem. I need more discipline. You know, but

459
00:51:20.72 --> 00:51:25.84
It's not really this huge problem, but it does help you know kind of thing so it's like a multivitamin interesting

460
00:51:25.84 --> 00:51:30.000
But I like the discipline. What is all?

461
00:51:32.72 --> 00:51:33.68
Okay, next question

462
00:51:34.64 --> 00:51:38.64
Coach jacco what are your thoughts on who is that mean a jiu-jitsu guy wrote that?

463
00:51:40.40 --> 00:51:44.32
I think so must be a must but but ways is someone from like the jimmy think?

464
00:51:44.88 --> 00:51:48.32
I don't know to address me it's coaching and first of all if you come to my gym you don't have to call me coach

465
00:51:48.88 --> 00:51:53.92
I kind of weird to you maybe that's why you do maybe just know some of black pelch and things actually be called coach

466
00:51:53.92 --> 00:51:57.68
Yeah, or it could be like one like chief, you know, hey, what's up chief what's up coach?

467
00:51:57.68 --> 00:52:01.36
I've heard coach. Oh, in fact, I don't mind coach in that regard

468
00:52:01.68 --> 00:52:03.68
Which you're only a brown belt how can you like coach?

469
00:52:04.24 --> 00:52:08.80
But you know what I remember when I sit long time ago where I was like, yeah, you know, I don't know

470
00:52:09.36 --> 00:52:14.000
No, I don't mind oh, you don't like boss. Yes, yeah, or dude when a girl says dude

471
00:52:14.32 --> 00:52:20.48
But I actually I used to joke and I'd say look guys if you don't feel comfortable calling me

472
00:52:20.48 --> 00:52:24.72
Sensei or instructor or coach you can just call me master

473
00:52:27.12 --> 00:52:34.48
But the reality is just call me jacco. Yeah, yeah, I heard someone call you coach is you know all certain guys they like that

474
00:52:34.48 --> 00:52:37.28
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't like correct people

475
00:52:37.28 --> 00:52:42.64
I don't say don't call me coach. No, I just I just I'm okay. I don't care what people call me to be honest with you

476
00:52:43.12 --> 00:52:45.12
Well

477
00:52:45.36 --> 00:52:47.68
But yeah, yeah, the guy called he was weird

478
00:52:47.68 --> 00:52:52.32
He's like you can't call me no, there's there's there's definitely a handful people that call me coach

479
00:52:52.88 --> 00:52:54.64
Yeah, maybe they don't roll know what my name is

480
00:52:57.84 --> 00:52:59.84
All right, so go back to the question coach

481
00:53:02.56 --> 00:53:07.76
Coach do what are your thoughts on dealing with old age when getting physically stronger and faster ain't gonna happen

482
00:53:09.44 --> 00:53:12.32
Well, I don't know I don't know the answer that question

483
00:53:12.32 --> 00:53:17.36
About age because it's not happening to me. I'm not getting any older

484
00:53:18.16 --> 00:53:22.80
I mean when is it that that it ain't gonna happen anymore? I don't know because

485
00:53:24.24 --> 00:53:29.04
I'm continuing to train I'm continuing to do what I do. I've had people tell me that well when you hit 30

486
00:53:29.44 --> 00:53:35.68
And then I had old when you hit 35 and then we get 40 now it's when you hit 45 now I'm here and when it's 50 so

487
00:53:36.80 --> 00:53:38.80
Yeah, I don't know

488
00:53:38.80 --> 00:53:46.16
I just know that I'm just gonna keep getting after it. I'm gonna keep getting faster. I'm gonna keep getting better and if I can't beat my record

489
00:53:47.44 --> 00:53:55.60
Well, then how close can I get how close can I get to the record and I think I've talked about this before is like I always think about decay

490
00:53:56.80 --> 00:53:57.76
and

491
00:53:57.76 --> 00:53:59.76
How if you don't fight decay

492
00:54:00.72 --> 00:54:08.56
It it starts to just you'll notice it it's slow and it's it's like moving like the our hand like you don't see it happening

493
00:54:08.56 --> 00:54:12.80
And I think that's why I think that's why a lot of aging happens because people don't notice it

494
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:17.92
It's happening so don't pay attention to it. So what happens is they don't hold the line

495
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:24.40
They don't hold the line and like I track my workouts. I'm not OCD about it. I'm not like a psycho like

496
00:54:24.96 --> 00:54:29.60
You know, I did it in 14 minutes and 32 seconds and then and then I refer back to it

497
00:54:29.60 --> 00:54:36.56
No, but I know the general trends and I know where the numbers are and I know where they should be and I know

498
00:54:36.56 --> 00:54:38.56
that

499
00:54:38.56 --> 00:54:40.56
I need to always keep those in mind

500
00:54:41.12 --> 00:54:46.64
You know how many poems can I do how much can I squat how much you know just those those those numbers?

501
00:54:46.64 --> 00:54:51.28
So you keep in line and I think what that does that I do that so I can't hold the line because like I said

502
00:54:51.28 --> 00:54:59.92
I think age sneaks. I don't think age assault you. I think it sneaks up on you and the way it sneaks up on you is

503
00:55:01.44 --> 00:55:03.44
a misrape there

504
00:55:03.44 --> 00:55:09.04
And a and a slower lap over here and a misst work out over there and you just

505
00:55:09.68 --> 00:55:16.16
Boom, there's just a little age is chipping away at you. It's just chip in a way. It doesn't if it actually doesn't want you to notice

506
00:55:16.48 --> 00:55:23.28
It doesn't want that's why it doesn't hit you all it wants it does just wants to chip away and then you fast forward 15 years and you're not the same guy

507
00:55:23.28 --> 00:55:24.48
You were

508
00:55:24.48 --> 00:55:29.04
Because those chips I have to take in and we'll take in all your strength the way they've taken your flexibility

509
00:55:29.04 --> 00:55:35.28
Way they've they've done a done work on you so that's why I like I said I don't know what okay

510
00:55:35.28 --> 00:55:37.28
Am I gonna be able to hold the same records?

511
00:55:38.96 --> 00:55:42.72
When I'm 59 and when we got some older guys like you know Gordon

512
00:55:43.76 --> 00:55:44.96
Gordon's

513
00:55:44.96 --> 00:55:46.80
54

514
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:54.08
Ben, I trained with Gordon. Yeah. I trained with Gordon. I mean Gordon's legit black belt and and he's not just a legit black belt with no looks like you can train with him

515
00:55:54.08 --> 00:55:56.08
He trains hard

516
00:55:56.24 --> 00:55:58.24
So

517
00:55:58.24 --> 00:56:00.24
I'm just very

518
00:56:00.24 --> 00:56:02.24
I try and stay

519
00:56:02.24 --> 00:56:09.60
Self-aware and I think I try and prevent the cutting of corners and I try and maintain the daily discipline and all things

520
00:56:09.60 --> 00:56:16.24
That's what I try and do because when you start cutting those corners is when I think it adds up over 15 years and you wake up

521
00:56:16.24 --> 00:56:17.68
And you're not the person that you

522
00:56:17.68 --> 00:56:20.48
Remember that you were and you're not the person you want to be

523
00:56:21.68 --> 00:56:22.72
So

524
00:56:22.72 --> 00:56:29.28
You got to maintain and hold that line as long as you can and I'm always actually trying to do new things too like trying to figure out

525
00:56:29.28 --> 00:56:33.76
Something else that's new some other technique I've never done before some exercise

526
00:56:33.76 --> 00:56:39.28
I haven't got a by some weird piece of exercise gear because I'll see something cool on the interwebs and other

527
00:56:39.28 --> 00:56:44.40
Old-day hang out. I can't do that. How's that 14-year-old girl doing that? I can't do that. I want to learn how to do that

528
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:47.44
and so that's that's

529
00:56:49.20 --> 00:56:51.20
I think you got to fight it

530
00:56:51.20 --> 00:56:54.80
Yeah, and that that's a good analogy the our hand

531
00:56:55.36 --> 00:56:58.56
No, where you can't you can't see it. You watch it all day you can't see move

532
00:56:58.56 --> 00:57:04.16
No, but look away for one second or not one second, but you know you look away for a little while you look back and boom

533
00:57:04.16 --> 00:57:07.44
That's not right up on you and that's I mean

534
00:57:07.84 --> 00:57:12.32
That's how you really slip that's how it'll assault you as far as age and your k-go's

535
00:57:12.80 --> 00:57:17.76
Where if you if you stop for a while and you try to come back if you stop for 10 years

536
00:57:17.76 --> 00:57:20.88
You know and you try to come back that our hand moved a lot

537
00:57:20.88 --> 00:57:25.68
They moved a lot. They have men's soul because you weren't fighting it. Yeah, because you can hold that our line

538
00:57:25.68 --> 00:57:28.40
I mean you can you can maybe you can't stop it

539
00:57:28.80 --> 00:57:32.48
You can slow that so yeah, yeah, just gotta keep your eye right on that thing

540
00:57:32.48 --> 00:57:40.48
I mean you're back. It's fun moving it all in sure you know like I said at when you're 90 and you've been looking at that our hands since you were 25

541
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:43.84
Then yeah, you're gonna be like oh I remember back when I was 25 is way over here

542
00:57:43.84 --> 00:57:49.12
Not my over here fitness-wise or whatever or I can squat last or whatever of course, you know baby

543
00:57:49.12 --> 00:57:51.12
That's the

544
00:57:52.08 --> 00:57:58.80
You never an ability, but just like I said yeah if you you just stay on that that discipline and all in all things

545
00:57:59.12 --> 00:58:03.52
And you're gonna hold that you know, hold it good do not go gentle into that good light

546
00:58:04.24 --> 00:58:09.52
Yeah, rage rage against the dying of the light and with that the

547
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:16.08
You know this kind of balanced all things don't kick you know guys will just be redlining their workout

548
00:58:16.08 --> 00:58:20.48
Because they're trying to maintain that no, no, you know you can't you gotta be careful about that

549
00:58:20.48 --> 00:58:24.16
Yeah, man, because it's just like a race car. You can't keep the race car in the red

550
00:58:24.72 --> 00:58:29.12
You gotta you gotta bring it back to the shop sometimes like it's tuned up. Yeah, that gotta be part of the routine

551
00:58:29.52 --> 00:58:36.32
Yeah, and I can know we I'm you know, I'm pretty good. That's another thing is the more you work out the more you train the more the

552
00:58:36.32 --> 00:58:41.44
The the better you know your own body. Yeah, and you know you walk up to the gym sometimes like

553
00:58:42.24 --> 00:58:44.24
Was it yesterday?

554
00:58:44.24 --> 00:58:45.60
Yeah, yesterday

555
00:58:45.60 --> 00:58:50.64
Man, I I felt like Superman like I was just super strong. I was doing one of my workouts

556
00:58:50.64 --> 00:58:53.44
I was strong. I was just technical. I just felt great

557
00:58:53.92 --> 00:58:55.28
You know and I would say

558
00:58:55.76 --> 00:58:58.96
There's some days that I go in the gym and I'm like, oh, what you know

559
00:58:59.12 --> 00:59:02.000
I got a stretch. I got a like taking easy day and

560
00:59:02.96 --> 00:59:05.20
And then there's some days where I say I got to take an easy day

561
00:59:05.20 --> 00:59:08.56
But anyways, I'm just gonna get crushed. I'm just gonna crush this thing

562
00:59:09.20 --> 00:59:12.16
But and part of that again because I see that

563
00:59:13.04 --> 00:59:15.04
You got to make sure that you're not cutting corners

564
00:59:15.44 --> 00:59:19.92
Got to make sure that you're not taking the eye off the hour and sometimes you let nothing get up

565
00:59:19.92 --> 00:59:21.60
Get one up and you because you're being lazy

566
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:25.68
So that's why going this is sometimes a lot of workouts I have

567
00:59:26.24 --> 00:59:31.36
You know have some dates. Sometimes where I feel like Superman. I have some days where I feel like I like horrible and I have a lot of

568
00:59:31.36 --> 00:59:37.36
More like lowest low slain or somebody yeah some days where I feel like I'm just going through the motions

569
00:59:37.52 --> 00:59:39.52
But going through the motions is okay

570
00:59:39.52 --> 00:59:43.76
It's okay to go in there and go through the motions. It's okay to go in there and not break any records

571
00:59:44.24 --> 00:59:49.84
Going in there and going through the motions is generally a thousand times better than then not doing anything

572
00:59:49.84 --> 00:59:51.84
Yeah, yeah, and that

573
00:59:52.56 --> 00:59:57.52
That's actually I mean red lining at all the time is a is a easy way to get knocked right out of the game

574
00:59:57.52 --> 01:00:00.24
Yeah, well you'll get injured half from well. Yeah, that's what I mean

575
01:00:00.24 --> 01:00:02.24
Especially when you start getting older, you know

576
01:00:03.60 --> 01:00:05.60
Maybe

577
01:00:06.56 --> 01:00:08.56
Right

578
01:00:12.32 --> 01:00:13.52
All right

579
01:00:13.76 --> 01:00:15.76
Next question what do you got?

580
01:00:17.52 --> 01:00:20.24
What are your favorite podcasts and why

581
01:00:21.52 --> 01:00:23.52
hashtag name

582
01:00:23.52 --> 01:00:25.52
dropping his okay

583
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:27.52
um

584
01:00:29.04 --> 01:00:31.04
So anybody that

585
01:00:32.24 --> 01:00:34.24
Listen to me

586
01:00:34.24 --> 01:00:39.36
There's a couple podcasts that I listen to and they're really obvious and they're like the big the big podcast

587
01:00:41.60 --> 01:00:48.48
You got well Tim Ferriss boom right you got Joe Rogan boom you got Sam Harris boom

588
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:55.52
And you got hardcore history with Dan Carlin and he's got another one that's called the common sense and I

589
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:00.16
Those those all those are

590
01:01:00.40 --> 01:01:03.76
really really good podcasts and

591
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm

592
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.36
I've been listening to podcast for many many years now

593
01:01:12.56 --> 01:01:15.68
Before listening to podcast was cool. I was listening to podcast

594
01:01:15.68 --> 01:01:19.04
Oh, I actually grew up listening to radio shows I've talked about that before

595
01:01:19.04 --> 01:01:23.60
But I have and I forget I actually I cannot remember how I got into podcasts

596
01:01:23.60 --> 01:01:25.60
I do not remember how I got into podcasts

597
01:01:27.04 --> 01:01:28.32
But

598
01:01:28.32 --> 01:01:29.36
Anyways

599
01:01:29.36 --> 01:01:32.72
Whenever I got into podcasts those are the kind of the ones that I

600
01:01:33.20 --> 01:01:39.76
Listen to and I've I sample a lot of other podcasts and sometimes I'll search for certain topics and I'll just listen to a random podcast

601
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:47.28
Um, one of the but there's one more the only one that I have that's like not on the main

602
01:01:48.56 --> 01:01:55.68
Sites and in people's view is a podcast called Margar made and it's by a guy named Darrell Cooper

603
01:01:56.48 --> 01:02:04.40
And I can't recommend that that podcast wrong enough. It's outstanding. It is an outstanding podcast and

604
01:02:04.88 --> 01:02:06.16
Darrell Cooper

605
01:02:06.16 --> 01:02:10.80
I don't even know like he's just this underground guy

606
01:02:11.20 --> 01:02:14.72
I think he's a I think he was in the navy, but he that's not he's not anymore

607
01:02:15.28 --> 01:02:17.12
he's

608
01:02:17.12 --> 01:02:24.000
He doesn't do it. It's not like a profession for him, but it should be he should be it's it's a great podcast

609
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.52
So check out Margar made it's also a he's on Twitter

610
01:02:28.16 --> 01:02:31.76
Under Margar made is his is his call sign, but he's got like

611
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:39.92
142 followers like no one knows no one knows about him and actually you know what it was somebody on Twitter

612
01:02:40.56 --> 01:02:41.92
And I don't forget who it was

613
01:02:42.80 --> 01:02:48.56
It was somebody on Twitter that told me about Margar made and we'll just check it out and when people tell me to check something out match

614
01:02:48.56 --> 01:02:54.24
Check it out and it's it's as soon as you open it, you know, you're gonna you're gonna realize why it's so good

615
01:02:54.24 --> 01:03:00.88
Um really detailed really very good historical research and it's a great podcast and

616
01:03:02.32 --> 01:03:07.04
Those are the and and you know what I'm a really picky podcast guy too like I'm really

617
01:03:07.76 --> 01:03:12.72
I need somebody to get I need somebody needs to bring it on their podcast for me to like it

618
01:03:13.44 --> 01:03:21.36
I try all I try new podcast all the time and I don't get a lot of repeat customers myself like I don't repeat a lot

619
01:03:21.36 --> 01:03:23.36
Um

620
01:03:23.36 --> 01:03:25.36
Because

621
01:03:25.92 --> 01:03:33.20
I just I just yeah, it needs to be really really solid that's for me to list from me to to for me to invest

622
01:03:34.24 --> 01:03:37.52
hours worth of my time. Yeah, that's that's got to be a heavy investment

623
01:03:38.16 --> 01:03:42.48
Yeah, and it's got to be something that's worth my while and that's why those that I mentioned let me grab a

624
01:03:45.52 --> 01:03:48.48
I'm just seeing if on my phone if there's any others that I might have missed

625
01:03:48.48 --> 01:03:54.16
But I don't think as far as like massively good ones that I can recommend across the board

626
01:03:55.04 --> 01:03:57.04
Those are them

627
01:03:57.52 --> 01:04:00.88
And you know, there's other ones and I'll occasionally listen to but

628
01:04:02.32 --> 01:04:05.92
And those are all kind of like the pop the the pop the popular ones that

629
01:04:06.48 --> 01:04:11.84
Come out donko Jones has got a good podcast that we interviews talks about rock and roll. I dig that one

630
01:04:12.48 --> 01:04:15.60
Only because I really dig donko Jones the band as well

631
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:24.16
The martyr made one yes, like what's kind of the format with Alan it it's it's it's no it's similar to hardcore history

632
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:29.44
It's him it's Darrell Cooper just talking about and that one the I think it's gonna be his

633
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:38.08
It's about the the Israeli palace Indian conflict it goes all the way back to the beginning and talks to you about what it is and what it's about and it's

634
01:04:39.04 --> 01:04:43.04
It's really good so those are the main podcast that I listen to

635
01:04:43.04 --> 01:04:44.48
Um

636
01:04:44.48 --> 01:04:46.48
Again, you've got a and

637
01:04:47.20 --> 01:04:53.60
It's it's just a big investment of time yeah, and especially because I don't have a commute so I don't drive anywhere so

638
01:04:54.64 --> 01:04:58.16
And I'm in and I can't I can't do anything

639
01:04:59.52 --> 01:05:03.20
Mentally and do a podcast at the same time and listen to a podcast

640
01:05:03.20 --> 01:05:08.88
So I can't read and listen to a podcast doesn't work the only thing I can do is drive and do yard work

641
01:05:08.88 --> 01:05:13.60
Like anything that's like actually when I have a big project to do with the house

642
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:18.40
I love it because I can get it all caught up on podcasts and whatever so yeah, but yeah, you know what that is

643
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:20.72
You know girls can do that you know

644
01:05:21.28 --> 01:05:24.40
I was not aware of that. Yeah, so this is so it works

645
01:05:25.76 --> 01:05:32.40
Girls can they said they I don't want to be dismissive in call it multitasking because it goes

646
01:05:33.44 --> 01:05:36.88
It's more deep than multi-cut girls can do things that require like

647
01:05:36.88 --> 01:05:39.44
Attention they can do more than one

648
01:05:40.72 --> 01:05:48.32
And then well guys can't I would be impressed by a girl that could listen to a legit podcast and read a book and get

649
01:05:48.88 --> 01:05:53.28
Like the full value out of both of them. Yeah, so how girls brains are wired

650
01:05:53.84 --> 01:06:01.04
They can do that a lot better than guys and guys, okay, but how's this though? This is kind of interesting and I used to do this all the time to mess with girls

651
01:06:01.04 --> 01:06:08.16
Guys have a different spatial awareness. Yes, so one of the tests that was done. Oh, it was like

652
01:06:08.16 --> 01:06:12.64
I want to say 16 I don't know the numbers, but it was a classroom just full of guys

653
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:16.48
Classroom full of girls and they'd run all these tests. There's different tests, but one of them was

654
01:06:17.12 --> 01:06:19.36
You have to draw a bicycle. That's it

655
01:06:19.92 --> 01:06:26.80
So a bicycle is this kind of in a way kind of this unique thing when you draw it because you have to know where this goes because that effect

656
01:06:26.80 --> 01:06:29.44
You know the pedals got affect the chain that affects it's a

657
01:06:29.44 --> 01:06:36.24
It proved or it indicated spatial awareness right so of the experiment all the guys could do it

658
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:41.36
You don't have to be an artist some bikes didn't look amazing, but they were working. You know have to be an artist and

659
01:06:41.84 --> 01:06:46.32
It doesn't matter if you're a bike rider or two so all the guys could do it

660
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:53.52
You know how many of the girls could do? No, no, really none. Yeah, so and I've done this experiment and

661
01:06:54.56 --> 01:06:59.04
If you're gonna do this experiment do it correctly. Don't be like hey, here's a bike copy this

662
01:06:59.04 --> 01:07:03.44
But don't cheat on it really if you really want to get to the bottom tell ask a girl in a girl

663
01:07:04.80 --> 01:07:07.84
Woman no matter what age draw a working bicycle

664
01:07:08.56 --> 01:07:14.88
They can't do it. I've yet to come across a girl. I'm doing that tonight when I go to my dad's daughters and yes as a guy

665
01:07:14.88 --> 01:07:16.88
It's pretty you most guys will do it

666
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.04
Yeah, it's weird, but anyway, it's just just how

667
01:07:21.92 --> 01:07:23.68
The brains are different well

668
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:28.72
Is other fun stuff for me. It is very difficult to actually engage in a book and reading

669
01:07:30.40 --> 01:07:35.84
Or writing while I'm listening to someone else talk about something intellectual. It's very challenging for me. Yeah

670
01:07:36.40 --> 01:07:40.88
Yeah, that's a to get the full value. I mean, I can do it, but they're the both efforts are half ass

671
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:43.44
Get anything out of them. Well

672
01:07:44.80 --> 01:07:49.84
Yeah, did you is any podcast you listen to that? I mentioned strangely. It's the same thing except for the murder made one

673
01:07:49.84 --> 01:07:56.000
Um, are you how could you not some argument after what you about that a bunch of times cut like he says scarcity of resources man

674
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.68
That resource resource being time

675
01:07:57.92 --> 01:08:02.24
But none of that actually even though the ones I do listen to I don't do as much

676
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:04.96
Because I don't try as much and um

677
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:08.08
I don't do as much yard to work anymore

678
01:08:09.28 --> 01:08:14.64
Except for that London real one the one that you were on the guy. They've actually like he's on my

679
01:08:14.64 --> 01:08:21.44
Yeah, he's not a podcast though. It is really yeah. I'm subscribed to it. Yeah, I didn't know his actual podcast

680
01:08:21.44 --> 01:08:24.96
I thought it was on the YouTube. I think it's like he takes the audio and puts it. Oh, okay

681
01:08:25.52 --> 01:08:30.80
Yeah, he's he does it and that's the thing like a lot of times people will like that's Brian rose

682
01:08:31.36 --> 01:08:35.68
With London real. Yeah, okay. That's a good suggestion. He gets some cool people on this on his show

683
01:08:35.76 --> 01:08:39.20
Yeah, it really really I mean put real simpletes and interview

684
01:08:39.44 --> 01:08:42.88
Yeah, yeah a lot of times like even Tim Ferriss is mostly like just interview

685
01:08:42.88 --> 01:08:48.72
Oh Tim Ferriss is actually absolutely an interview. Yeah, so and then you have Joe Rogan who's kind of like conversation kind of an interview

686
01:08:48.72 --> 01:08:54.96
But it's more of like they're just talking to the conversation so there's like all these little different subtleties that are that make some different but

687
01:08:56.40 --> 01:08:59.44
There it takes a lot of skill to interview people good and

688
01:09:00.40 --> 01:09:05.20
This the London real guy. Yeah, pros yeah, he's um he's good

689
01:09:05.76 --> 01:09:07.76
down to like who he chooses

690
01:09:07.76 --> 01:09:13.12
They're like pretty much across the board everybody's interesting. Yeah, even if the subject isn't your thing, okay?

691
01:09:13.12 --> 01:09:18.16
But the guys he chooses for those subjects are pretty solid. Yeah, that's a good one

692
01:09:18.72 --> 01:09:22.72
Yeah, and I really do I I really like podcast a lot and

693
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:27.92
You can get so much information out of them and I love the audio

694
01:09:28.64 --> 01:09:35.36
Format yeah, you know, I just it's just great when you can when you can just sit down and listen

695
01:09:35.36 --> 01:09:38.32
That's always what I've said for for for this podcast

696
01:09:38.88 --> 01:09:43.60
Like I want it to be something where people sit down and kind of put their headphones on and say okay

697
01:09:44.32 --> 01:09:48.08
I'm getting ready to press press play three two

698
01:09:48.56 --> 01:09:55.20
One here it comes yeah, and I mean it like we're doing a Q and A and obviously Q and A doesn't have

699
01:09:55.68 --> 01:10:02.80
That same level of impact as if I'm gonna read something either that I wrote or something that somebody else wrote

700
01:10:02.80 --> 01:10:08.72
That's a very important subject matter that we're gonna break down then that's sort of

701
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.60
That's that's what I like yeah, these these these Q and A ones are cool because

702
01:10:16.56 --> 01:10:22.72
It is like of course we're just having a conversation about this stuff, but it's there's a third person in the room as well

703
01:10:23.12 --> 01:10:27.92
Right every question because it's their question. Yeah, that's true. And that's one thing that's interesting like when you're listening to

704
01:10:27.92 --> 01:10:35.68
When you're listening to any of these podcasts that I talked about you're basically a third person in the room sitting there listening to the conversation

705
01:10:35.68 --> 01:10:40.88
And actually when I was on Sam Harris, you know your brother drove up with me and he wasn't the room listening to the conversation

706
01:10:40.88 --> 01:10:42.88
You know, it's kind of it's got a very interesting

707
01:10:43.04 --> 01:10:47.84
But you know when you're listening to Joe Rogan and and actually one thing that's pretty cool is I've

708
01:10:48.56 --> 01:10:52.64
You know I've done interview with Sam Harris. I've done interview Joe Rogan. I've done interview you've Tim Ferris

709
01:10:52.64 --> 01:10:56.88
I've had some good conversations with with

710
01:10:58.96 --> 01:11:02.64
With Dan Carlin and I might end up being on common sense at some point

711
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:07.84
But with with the other three with Darryl Cooper, I don't know but I know those guys

712
01:11:08.24 --> 01:11:12.96
I know I know them and so when I'm when I'm listening to their podcasts, I do feel like I'm kind of in the room with them

713
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:17.36
I'm in sometimes I want to like answer and say something and whatever so

714
01:11:18.72 --> 01:11:20.24
Yeah, it's

715
01:11:20.24 --> 01:11:25.12
And I think everybody I think even people that never met Jill Rogan, but they list all of the podcasts

716
01:11:25.12 --> 01:11:27.52
They think they're in there with them. Yeah, so when I went

717
01:11:28.08 --> 01:11:32.88
I did a thing with Joe Rogan played pool with them and I went up to that studio before

718
01:11:33.68 --> 01:11:38.24
And what'd you go up for with Halleck or something? I went with yeah for Halleck

719
01:11:39.52 --> 01:11:41.52
Yes, for some stuff

720
01:11:41.52 --> 01:11:43.68
Yeah, so that time when I went up I asked him hey, do you

721
01:11:43.68 --> 01:11:49.44
Encounter people who basically feel like they know you like personally?

722
01:11:49.44 --> 01:11:53.60
They'll just roll into a conversation if you like you know and he said I'm sure every single time

723
01:11:53.60 --> 01:11:58.16
Yeah, that's the same even I'm experiencing that now when I when I when I meet someone that goes

724
01:11:58.24 --> 01:12:01.84
Hey man, I listen to the podcast hey and they're like talking like well, you

725
01:12:01.84 --> 01:12:04.80
Yeah, what's what's going on with echoing blah, blah, blah

726
01:12:04.80 --> 01:12:09.60
And they're like talking about me like like we're bros, yeah, and it's it's pretty cool because in a way you are

727
01:12:09.60 --> 01:12:12.88
Yeah, I don't know them for a long time. I know I was thinking about this

728
01:12:15.12 --> 01:12:19.52
So like hardcore history the the one podcast that is called

729
01:12:20.16 --> 01:12:24.32
Blueprint for Armageddon if you haven't listened to it just stop and go listen to it

730
01:12:25.36 --> 01:12:27.36
It's awesome but

731
01:12:27.36 --> 01:12:33.28
That thing is it's five episodes for about four hours each so that's 20 hours and when you get done with it

732
01:12:33.28 --> 01:12:37.68
Man, you you feel like you're pretty tight with Dan Carl. I mean that's 20 hours and then one day

733
01:12:37.68 --> 01:12:44.24
I was doing the math last week and we because we got a 30 podcast and they're basically two hours each and I'm like like I got that 60 hours

734
01:12:45.04 --> 01:12:47.04
60 hours worth of

735
01:12:47.20 --> 01:12:48.16
worth of

736
01:12:48.16 --> 01:12:52.32
Conversation with you and me and so absolutely people start feeling like

737
01:12:53.12 --> 01:13:00.40
You know, hey, oh, yeah, I know I know what joc was gonna think about this or say about this and and and they're basically in the room here

738
01:13:00.40 --> 01:13:03.04
You know talking to us. Yeah, and they said added element

739
01:13:03.04 --> 01:13:08.88
Which is gonna make that even more so with us because these are there these are your questions

740
01:13:08.88 --> 01:13:15.04
Yeah there and and I do converse with them on the interwebs too

741
01:13:15.04 --> 01:13:20.16
So so people are like oh and they'll hit me with a question and sometimes it's not enough to get on the podcast

742
01:13:20.16 --> 01:13:22.16
But I'll just say yeah, don't do that

743
01:13:22.72 --> 01:13:27.36
You know don't do that. That's not smart. Oh, yeah, no, that sounds like a good plan execute, you know stuff like that

744
01:13:27.92 --> 01:13:29.76
You know, it's just the nature of the

745
01:13:29.76 --> 01:13:33.44
But yeah, get your podcast on and spread the word and

746
01:13:34.64 --> 01:13:36.64
And by the way, thanks to

747
01:13:36.64 --> 01:13:38.64
Thanks Tim and Joe

748
01:13:39.04 --> 01:13:44.24
Those guys brought me on before I had a podcast Tim brought me on when the book was now

749
01:13:44.24 --> 01:13:48.48
I was basically no human being knew who I was if you weren't like in

750
01:13:49.44 --> 01:13:52.80
The direct like if you weren't in the seal teams with me and

751
01:13:52.80 --> 01:14:00.56
And then Joe heard that podcast and then we connected on Twitter and he goes come be on my podcast and I was like awesome

752
01:14:01.28 --> 01:14:06.88
So and then Sam Harris so anyways, thanks to those guys for having me on and spread in the word a little bit

753
01:14:07.20 --> 01:14:10.56
Yeah, I like Sam Harris is one as well. That's actually one of the

754
01:14:11.60 --> 01:14:14.96
One of the few that that remember how we were talking before you

755
01:14:16.32 --> 01:14:19.36
Did a podcast or like I'd be weird you just talking

756
01:14:19.36 --> 01:14:24.96
Which actually thinking about it wouldn't be that weird really yeah, but I mean if you think about like even the last podcast

757
01:14:24.96 --> 01:14:26.72
That we did where I just read the book

758
01:14:27.52 --> 01:14:35.44
Four hours in my life. Yeah, you didn't say much, you know and you said enough to maybe get me through some some some spots where

759
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:38.72
You had a question or maybe I didn't make something clear

760
01:14:39.52 --> 01:14:44.08
But you know, I think that's I think I could do it, but you know

761
01:14:44.80 --> 01:14:47.44
I don't I don't know why I would

762
01:14:47.44 --> 01:14:51.28
Yeah, see what I'd rather just have to talk and do overall. Yeah overall

763
01:14:51.92 --> 01:14:57.92
Especially with with the Q&A with and I think sometimes you'll go into things that doesn't apply to everyone's common knowledge

764
01:14:57.92 --> 01:15:01.84
You know, maybe only military guys will know it or all the exact same I know it so

765
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:04.16
I don't you know this last stuff. I don't know

766
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:10.88
So I have the luxury of being here. Wait wait. What do you what is this? What are you talking about? What is ROTC mean?

767
01:15:12.32 --> 01:15:14.32
Just kidding. I don't know what ROTC mean

768
01:15:14.32 --> 01:15:20.000
Anyway, but yeah Sam Harris is good though where he just does it solo. I actually followed Sam Harris from

769
01:15:21.12 --> 01:15:29.68
Long time ago. Yeah, yeah, he did the one with Scott Reetz from the LAPD. That's a good one. Yeah, you know like the Tim Ferris one of Josh wait's getting he's got a couple with him

770
01:15:29.92 --> 01:15:32.80
Josh wait's getting really he's Jiu-Jitsu player

771
01:15:33.52 --> 01:15:37.20
He's a world champion chess guy and just just

772
01:15:37.76 --> 01:15:39.76
Cazin interesting attitude about stuff

773
01:15:39.76 --> 01:15:45.76
Yeah, it makes me feel like you know there's a lot more to learn out there about things he wrote a book called the Art of Learning

774
01:15:46.16 --> 01:15:47.76
Anyways, that's a that's a really good one

775
01:15:49.44 --> 01:15:55.12
Joe wrote Scott Reetz so much of what Joe Rogan Joe Rogan just always worked for us to do

776
01:15:55.92 --> 01:16:00.96
And it's weird like I pretty much would Joe I listen to the people if I know the person that he's got on there

777
01:16:01.52 --> 01:16:06.40
And I don't listen to a lot of comedians right because I don't know either the comedians don't make me laugh

778
01:16:06.40 --> 01:16:11.60
That's the weird not weird. That's the good thing about Joe Rogan because yes so many different elements of interest

779
01:16:11.60 --> 01:16:14.40
Yeah, there's a comedian Jiu-Jitsu guys. I make a

780
01:16:14.88 --> 01:16:20.56
What he does really well is he makes people talk and he you know I've heard him get some criticism for

781
01:16:22.08 --> 01:16:24.08
You know, let's say he's got like a

782
01:16:24.64 --> 01:16:27.28
Religious guy on there and he doesn't believe in religion

783
01:16:27.76 --> 01:16:32.88
But he'll let that person talk about religion and won't like jump on him and get in their face and say you know

784
01:16:32.88 --> 01:16:37.20
But that's part of what makes it cool is like he's just trying to learn man

785
01:16:37.20 --> 01:16:39.20
He's not trying to confront people, you know

786
01:16:39.20 --> 01:16:43.84
He's just trying to learn and I think that's I think all those people do that for the most part

787
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:50.48
There people that are interested in learning and they're trying to figure stuff out themselves and so

788
01:16:50.48 --> 01:16:55.04
I think it's cool that that Jill Rogan's not getting in somebody's face about something

789
01:16:55.04 --> 01:16:57.52
I don't believe in me. I mean, I'm not that he doesn't disagree with people sometimes

790
01:16:57.52 --> 01:17:06.08
Yeah, so that's that listen to some podcasts and you know the other thing about this is like

791
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:14.56
We're putting out one podcast a week and that I don't even know if that's sustainable

792
01:17:16.48 --> 01:17:21.60
Only because of time. I mean, the amount of time that it takes to prepare a

793
01:17:21.60 --> 01:17:27.28
A podcast in the beginning it was pretty easy for me because I was doing a bunch of books that I already read

794
01:17:27.68 --> 01:17:30.88
I already read them all I just crack them open and most of those books I went well read

795
01:17:30.88 --> 01:17:34.24
I mean about face already had that thing outlined and highlighted

796
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:41.12
Last hundred yards already I mean a bunch of those beginning books were already done and it wasn't until like

797
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.40
Until everyone on Twitter started telling me hey check out this book and now I'm also reading books

798
01:17:46.40 --> 01:17:48.88
I've never seen before and I got to read the book and

799
01:17:48.88 --> 01:17:52.96
What I do is I read it and I go through and highlight it and somebody asked me this question to you

800
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:57.36
How do you prep so I read the book? I go through a highlight the whole thing of what I think is impactful

801
01:17:57.36 --> 01:17:58.72
What I think is important

802
01:17:59.04 --> 01:18:02.40
But then once you read it you can't just it does doesn't

803
01:18:04.16 --> 01:18:08.16
It you just don't pick it up and read the highlighted parts in order because that doesn't always make sense

804
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:10.40
And it also doesn't always have the it doesn't make

805
01:18:11.04 --> 01:18:16.16
People think doesn't make me think about what I want to think about doesn't have the impact that I want it to have

806
01:18:16.16 --> 01:18:20.24
So once I have it highlighted then I have to go through and plus all highlight

807
01:18:20.72 --> 01:18:23.20
You know, let's say a highlight half the book

808
01:18:23.92 --> 01:18:28.64
Well then you're not gonna read half the book so then I got to go in and figure out what really is

809
01:18:29.12 --> 01:18:35.28
Important and then from there I got to organize it in the way that the timeline that I'm actually gonna read it allowed

810
01:18:36.48 --> 01:18:38.48
And then make notes about

811
01:18:38.48 --> 01:18:47.68
Whatever comments I have about it as I'm reading it because that's sort of that's sort of why I'm doing it because I want to comment about what I'm reading because otherwise people just go by the book

812
01:18:48.16 --> 01:18:52.000
And read the book yourself, but I'm trying to give my perspective on some of it

813
01:18:53.44 --> 01:18:55.44
And so that's challenging and

814
01:18:55.60 --> 01:19:01.12
And then the other weird thing is like I've I meet people all the time because I travel all the time

815
01:19:01.12 --> 01:19:07.04
I go to events and and speak and companies that I'm working with and a lot of times the people that are there that are

816
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:10.96
Totally into the podcast. They're not even caught up. They're they're not caught up with podcasts

817
01:19:10.96 --> 01:19:17.12
They're like hey, I'm almost caught up and I'm like what do you mean? I thought I fell behind because I I thought I'm a lot of why I'm only on

818
01:19:17.52 --> 01:19:19.52
26 right now and

819
01:19:20.08 --> 01:19:21.12
So

820
01:19:21.12 --> 01:19:25.04
Sometimes I think well, maybe people are just we're just turning out at such a high rate

821
01:19:25.84 --> 01:19:29.92
But then there's some people that I've talked to as as I think about like a moment

822
01:19:29.92 --> 01:19:35.52
Maybe I need to slow down a little bit and I've talked to some of the some of the people that I work with and people that listen to the podcast that are into it

823
01:19:35.52 --> 01:19:41.12
And I say like you know we might go down to you know once every two weeks and it's like I just

824
01:19:41.68 --> 01:19:45.88
Smack them in the face. So like no, no, you know I think it'd be you know

825
01:19:46.68 --> 01:19:49.68
But sometimes I also feel that

826
01:19:51.04 --> 01:19:55.96
If I had more time that I would be able to do a better job like maybe that's something I need to weigh as well

827
01:19:56.68 --> 01:20:02.76
And if you think about like hardcore history call that guy Dan Carlin is he just makes people

828
01:20:02.76 --> 01:20:07.64
He tortures people making him wait and it makes you wait and wait and

829
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:14.04
So I don't know maybe we maybe we need to go to once every two weeks. Maybe I just need to suck it up and just keep doing

830
01:20:14.04 --> 01:20:16.04
I don't know maybe I don't know yet, but

831
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:18.36
Yeah

832
01:20:18.36 --> 01:20:23.26
Wait one thing that's good about all these other podcasts is that gives you an opportunity to go listen to something else

833
01:20:24.04 --> 01:20:26.04
Or you go back and read listen

834
01:20:26.04 --> 01:20:28.04
Yeah

835
01:20:32.04 --> 01:20:40.04
I'm sure we might get some feedback on that one. Yeah, so people think if you out there thinks you'd be okay with us going every two weeks

836
01:20:40.72 --> 01:20:42.72
Yeah, or if it's gonna ruin your life

837
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:49.52
Yeah, because it probably takes 15 to 20 hours now. I'm a slow reader

838
01:20:50.52 --> 01:20:53.96
I'm a slow reader so when I'm reading a book it's it's I read

839
01:20:53.96 --> 01:20:59.000
at the same pace that I talk now when I'm on the podcast

840
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.08
I'm talking a little bit slower than I normally talk, but when I'm reading I'm reading about the pace

841
01:21:03.08 --> 01:21:07.000
I'm speaking right about now this is just a normal and what's good about it?

842
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.96
And I learn this in college when I read and I'm reading it this pace

843
01:21:09.96 --> 01:21:13.32
I remember just about everything that I read if I read fast

844
01:21:13.32 --> 01:21:19.06
All of Tim Ferris and speed reading. I don't retain the same amount and so I read slow

845
01:21:19.06 --> 01:21:24.36
I absorb I'm thinking about it. I'm making some notes so to get through a book it takes 10

846
01:21:24.66 --> 01:21:25.66
15 hours

847
01:21:25.66 --> 01:21:29.74
So then you get through with that now you got to go back through it again

848
01:21:30.74 --> 01:21:32.74
and decide what the actual

849
01:21:33.38 --> 01:21:34.98
the actual

850
01:21:34.98 --> 01:21:36.98
Script timing that you're gonna read it

851
01:21:37.46 --> 01:21:43.54
So now I'm like marking up the book and I'm going back and I'm writing the page numbers and I'm tapping it out that takes a few hours three hours

852
01:21:43.54 --> 01:21:49.22
And so by that's all said and done you know you're talking about 20 hours 15 to 20 hours to prep and

853
01:21:51.46 --> 01:22:00.34
Everything we like today or yesterday I got done prepping for this podcast or actually I got done prepping for the the four hours in my life

854
01:22:00.34 --> 01:22:04.34
As soon as I got done I literally picked it up. I would sit up at my bookshelf and I started looking okay

855
01:22:04.34 --> 01:22:08.98
What it's gonna what's coming next? I want to start reading it now. Yeah, yeah, yeah

856
01:22:10.02 --> 01:22:12.02
But that's the

857
01:22:12.02 --> 01:22:14.02
The jacco preparedness

858
01:22:14.42 --> 01:22:23.10
Yeah, you know hyper preparedness right hyper preparedness and also it's because when like I said earlier when somebody presses play on the podcast

859
01:22:23.10 --> 01:22:28.02
I want them to I want them to be getting a piece of quality material right I'm not gonna turn out something

860
01:22:28.18 --> 01:22:33.14
That's just that's just crap. I would rather not do it at all. I'd rather shut down

861
01:22:33.14 --> 01:22:37.02
And take a six-month break or a lifelong break and never do it again

862
01:22:37.02 --> 01:22:39.02
Then just start turning it out for no reason

863
01:22:39.02 --> 01:22:45.18
Really escalated that real quick. Yeah, I know it long. You know why you know why did that because

864
01:22:45.66 --> 01:22:48.46
I have to maintain that attitude of like

865
01:22:49.50 --> 01:22:53.78
Like I'm not doing this I'm doing this because I want to do it

866
01:22:54.26 --> 01:22:58.54
Yeah, you know what I mean I'm doing this because I want to do it and if I don't want to do it then I'm not gonna do it

867
01:22:58.54 --> 01:23:00.54
right and it is

868
01:23:02.14 --> 01:23:06.94
I mean like I said I like to hit I like to hit play on a podcast and be like okay

869
01:23:06.94 --> 01:23:12.22
This is it just like sitting down to listen to great music or anything like that the podcast for me is like that

870
01:23:12.22 --> 01:23:14.98
It's like reading a great book. It's like watching a great movie

871
01:23:14.98 --> 01:23:17.50
It's sitting down pressing playing going okay

872
01:23:17.50 --> 01:23:21.90
This is gonna have impact on me and so I want to turn something out like that

873
01:23:21.90 --> 01:23:28.74
I don't want to turn out second rate stuff. I want to turn out something legit and if I can if I fail to do that

874
01:23:29.02 --> 01:23:31.02
then I'm not gonna do it

875
01:23:32.38 --> 01:23:35.26
at least now I'm saying if I was

876
01:23:35.26 --> 01:23:42.14
Was failed to do it, but I was trying my hardest. Okay. I might continue because I'm trying and I'm making but if I was failing to do it

877
01:23:42.14 --> 01:23:46.62
Because I wasn't putting the effort into it. Then I'm not gonna do it because that's I think I think that

878
01:23:47.02 --> 01:23:48.06
my

879
01:23:48.06 --> 01:23:52.46
Personal expectations and the expectations that people have when they press play

880
01:23:52.70 --> 01:23:54.70
They want to get something good

881
01:23:54.70 --> 01:24:00.36
Yeah, they want to get some quality they want to learn something they want to they want to enter into the game

882
01:24:00.52 --> 01:24:02.02
whereas

883
01:24:02.02 --> 01:24:08.26
If they start pressing play and they hear garbage, man, I don't want them to hear that and I don't want to be that

884
01:24:08.26 --> 01:24:10.98
That's not my gig my gig is

885
01:24:11.54 --> 01:24:17.78
Going hard putting out hard and putting out something that that people want to listen to because it helps them

886
01:24:18.26 --> 01:24:20.58
Not doing it just to do it. That's not my thing

887
01:24:21.06 --> 01:24:23.70
Yeah, and if you start slipping in that regard

888
01:24:24.18 --> 01:24:28.02
Right, you can smell it from on my own away, man. Yeah, yeah

889
01:24:28.02 --> 01:24:31.86
I'll tell you what the one thing I have realized when I first started I thought oh well

890
01:24:31.86 --> 01:24:33.86
I don't know you know there's only so many books

891
01:24:33.86 --> 01:24:38.50
You know that I could actually do because I'm thinking books that had impact on me real legit impact

892
01:24:39.54 --> 01:24:41.54
There wasn't some huge list

893
01:24:41.70 --> 01:24:47.14
But as soon as I started going down the path now I realized that there's literally I could I could I could

894
01:24:47.14 --> 01:24:50.74
I'm not gonna be able to do in my lifetime all the books I want to do. Yeah, you know what I mean?

895
01:24:50.74 --> 01:24:54.78
Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to kind of enlisting other people to make suggestions

896
01:24:54.78 --> 01:24:59.50
Which people are enlisting the ivory trooper out there sending me two or three books and saying hey check this out

897
01:24:59.50 --> 01:25:03.18
My Amazon bill click through to jockel podcast click through to Amazon

898
01:25:03.18 --> 01:25:08.06
We got it going on because I have that money's from me because I'm ordering books all the time when somebody says

899
01:25:08.06 --> 01:25:10.54
Hey check this book out. I don't have time to play around

900
01:25:10.54 --> 01:25:13.82
Do you know what I do? I just order it. I just click through an order it on Amazon

901
01:25:13.98 --> 01:25:17.98
But I need I'm literally literally getting a new bookshelf in my house

902
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:21.42
Because I've got so many books piling up and

903
01:25:21.42 --> 01:25:25.82
And yeah that to me what's good about it?

904
01:25:26.86 --> 01:25:29.26
I love this guy. This is another thing and I told you this early on

905
01:25:29.82 --> 01:25:32.78
Because early on you said hey, you know, it was like three weeks into it

906
01:25:32.78 --> 01:25:35.74
You're like hey, I don't know if we're gonna be able to keep up this pace and I said you know what?

907
01:25:35.74 --> 01:25:40.46
I like this grind. I want to be maxed out. I want to have the pedal down and you know what?

908
01:25:40.86 --> 01:25:46.70
I want to be going hard and I think the people that listen to the podcast are people that are going hard in their

909
01:25:46.70 --> 01:25:54.14
Perspective lives. They're going they're they're working hard. They're making things happen. They're being aggressive and that's what I'm doing here

910
01:25:54.14 --> 01:25:58.62
That's what we're doing here and so I think that's why it resonates with some people

911
01:25:59.18 --> 01:26:03.10
And there's some people that are listening to this that know that they kind of step it up a little bit

912
01:26:03.42 --> 01:26:05.42
You know and that also is a good thing

913
01:26:05.74 --> 01:26:09.66
I don't think there's too many people that are like jocco get your get it together

914
01:26:09.90 --> 01:26:15.66
You need to get your game on they know I'm bringing my egg game right? I'm bringing my egg game and and people know that

915
01:26:15.66 --> 01:26:18.62
But the day that I can't bring my egg game

916
01:26:19.66 --> 01:26:22.78
Then couple things maybe it's time. Okay, you know what I need more time

917
01:26:23.26 --> 01:26:26.70
Because I don't want to turn out crap or I don't do it anymore or

918
01:26:27.74 --> 01:26:29.74
We do it whenever but

919
01:26:30.94 --> 01:26:34.78
The I like being driven I like a deadline

920
01:26:34.78 --> 01:26:40.78
I learn a lot from the podcast from from getting ready for it because you got to remember I read a book

921
01:26:40.78 --> 01:26:47.82
So you got a little bit by listening to an hour of me talking about a book. I read a book. I absorbed it. I highlighted it. I outlined it

922
01:26:48.38 --> 01:26:53.26
I researched it. I looked up and I look up. Oh, that general he sounds like an interesting

923
01:26:53.26 --> 01:26:56.06
I only just do a real quick fact check to see if there's anything in the behind the scenes

924
01:26:56.06 --> 01:27:00.94
I need to tell about him. Oh, you know what there's a poem that's related to this I'm thinking out poems that I

925
01:27:01.42 --> 01:27:06.62
Didn't know didn't understand and reviewing them so all these little things

926
01:27:06.62 --> 01:27:12.30
That you know and who knows. I mean, does this should this be the full-time job?

927
01:27:13.10 --> 01:27:18.46
I don't know you know and by the way the whole time that I'm doing this I got a business

928
01:27:18.70 --> 01:27:21.74
You know with life that we're traveling and working with companies

929
01:27:22.22 --> 01:27:27.18
I got other books in the hopper that I'm writing currently and I have to spend time doing that

930
01:27:28.14 --> 01:27:33.18
Which I'm super pumped about those as well, but like those that takes time. So yeah

931
01:27:33.18 --> 01:27:37.82
Dang yeah, but but again, you know what bring it on bring it on

932
01:27:38.94 --> 01:27:45.18

933
01:27:45.18 --> 01:27:47.18
I can make it happen

934
01:27:50.30 --> 01:27:54.66
Some people choose to get after red line and we encourage that red line

935
01:27:54.94 --> 01:27:57.42
I'm talking about red line this bad boy

936
01:27:57.42 --> 01:28:08.78
Speaking of red lineing next question. Please discuss how discipline equals freedom can and should apply to one's financial life

937
01:28:10.70 --> 01:28:12.70
Thanks for my last trip

938
01:28:14.30 --> 01:28:21.10
Obviously if you want to be financially free you're gonna have financial discipline. That's just the way it is so here's

939
01:28:21.10 --> 01:28:28.62
It's it's just simple not easy save your money boom. That's number one don't buy an X here's one

940
01:28:29.98 --> 01:28:31.98
Don't buy an expensive car

941
01:28:33.18 --> 01:28:39.74
Until you want to piece of property. That's just a basic rule. Just yeah if you're driving a Mercedes

942
01:28:42.62 --> 01:28:45.58
S class from 2015

943
01:28:45.58 --> 01:28:50.46
Is that a good one? That's it's a very good one. It's a very good one, but it's also

944
01:28:51.26 --> 01:28:58.14
$120,000 but if you're living if you're renting the wrong move sell that thing and buy a piece of property

In something I

951
01:29:19.58 --> 01:29:21.58
Like to invest money in me

952
01:29:22.86 --> 01:29:28.38
In things that I'm gonna do that's what I want to do yeah, I want to invest money in things that I know

953
01:29:28.38 --> 01:29:34.06
I understand what better do I know and understand than than things that I'm doing for people that I know or things that I'm involved with

954
01:29:34.62 --> 01:29:36.62

That's what you're gonna do you want to you want to get your money taken care of you want to you want to have financial freedom

956
01:29:42.46 --> 01:29:46.38
You got to just have the financial discipline that's that's all there is to it and work hard

957
01:29:47.02 --> 01:29:51.42
You know or card make things happen, but your your major gains

958
01:29:52.94 --> 01:29:56.46
You know most people don't become rich by their salary

959
01:29:57.02 --> 01:30:01.18
Right they become they be they earn their wealth they gain their wealth

960
01:30:01.90 --> 01:30:08.46
Through bigger things like buying properties you know we got a G.J. to two players at the at the academy

961
01:30:08.46 --> 01:30:10.46
Girl and

962
01:30:12.30 --> 01:30:13.82
You know a year ago

963
01:30:13.82 --> 01:30:20.22
She was kind of talking to me about oh well, you know, you know, she's just got married and blah blah blah and

964
01:30:21.50 --> 01:30:23.58
We started talking I said you you know

965
01:30:23.58 --> 01:30:28.06
She's with a thing about moving I got this condo and I was like we started talking about buying properties and boom

966
01:30:28.06 --> 01:30:34.78
She disclosed on a like a four four unit property in San Diego and the day she got the keys

967
01:30:34.78 --> 01:30:38.14
She was making $400 a month

968
01:30:38.38 --> 01:30:42.62
She went from paying $1,900 a month and mortgage the day she made

969
01:30:43.18 --> 01:30:46.30
She got the keys all of a sudden that she rented that place out

970
01:30:46.30 --> 01:30:52.06
She's got three units. She's living with crappiest unit and she's got those things rented out and now she's making $400 a month

971
01:30:52.06 --> 01:30:56.30
So that's a that's a delta of what $2300 a month in the back

972
01:30:57.58 --> 01:31:00.94
That's impressive yeah, and it took her a year to get done

973
01:31:00.94 --> 01:31:05.90
But she did and now I said she's like I'm so happy. I'm like that's cool. It's starting saving

974
01:31:06.22 --> 01:31:10.22
Start saving for your next property. I'm like the market's gonna take it down turn you got to be ready

975
01:31:10.22 --> 01:31:12.70
If it does and if it does but you got to be ready to make that next move

976
01:31:12.70 --> 01:31:16.46
So start saving your money start paying that thing down start saving your money start saving that next down payment

977
01:31:16.62 --> 01:31:20.14
That's where your wealth gets established isn't easy long term

978
01:31:20.86 --> 01:31:22.86
strategic moves that you make and

979
01:31:23.50 --> 01:31:25.50
You know, I'm no financial expert

980
01:31:25.50 --> 01:31:29.74
But you'll have to be a financial expert to know to save your money to spend less than you earn

981
01:31:29.74 --> 01:31:31.74
um

982
01:31:31.74 --> 01:31:35.34
and property to me is a good thing to invest in it does go up and down

983
01:31:35.90 --> 01:31:40.86
You know and there's a lot of people that got crushed in the in the market downturn in 2007

984
01:31:41.74 --> 01:31:46.06
In 2008 and I was in the military so I was buying houses and I didn't even know that the market downturn

985
01:31:46.06 --> 01:31:50.70
It didn't matter to me because I had a steady job and I just bought those properties just to just to have properties

986
01:31:50.70 --> 01:31:55.10
I wasn't buying them to flip them and sell them and all that no, I was just like okay and some some time in the

987
01:31:55.10 --> 01:32:01.98
Future some of these can be paying me rent and it's gonna be on my pocket and that sounds like a good plan to me because they're not making any more real estate by the beach, right?

988
01:32:03.10 --> 01:32:05.10
So so

989
01:32:05.10 --> 01:32:06.62
yeah

990
01:32:06.62 --> 01:32:08.62
I'm not a financial genius

991
01:32:08.62 --> 01:32:12.46
Talk to somebody that is smart talk to somebody that understands finances, but

992
01:32:13.10 --> 01:32:19.34
Save your money spend less in your and don't be renting if don't be renting a place if you're buying out buying a Mercedes S class

993
01:32:20.14 --> 01:32:22.94
or a seven series or a range rover

994
01:32:22.94 --> 01:32:25.34
Yeah, buy a little piece of property buy a little thing

995
01:32:26.06 --> 01:32:30.54
Buy a little thing don't just just go buy that little something get in there get it started

996
01:32:31.34 --> 01:32:33.34
Yeah, and I like this

997
01:32:33.02 --> 01:32:35.34
Invest in yourself

998
01:32:35.74 --> 01:32:36.70
Yeah

999
01:32:36.70 --> 01:32:42.54
Because and investing yourself, yeah, that's a such a broad term and such it and actually it's kind of

1000
01:32:43.02 --> 01:32:46.30
Started to become like a little like a cliche

1001
01:32:47.34 --> 01:32:49.50
Catchphrase and that's in yourself

1002
01:32:49.50 --> 01:32:52.86
But if you really think about that you

1003
01:32:53.74 --> 01:32:58.62
Yeah, you invest in yourself. You don't go buy you know, I used to work in the nightclub industry, right?

1004
01:32:58.62 --> 01:33:03.34
So I'm and I'm now I'm looking with my mindset now looking back at the people I used to deal with

1005
01:33:03.42 --> 01:33:11.66
I used to be see people coming there every weekend and spend a lot of money. I don't know. Maybe some of them are already a richer or but

1006
01:33:12.70 --> 01:33:17.90
I know that if that's what you're spending your money on you're going out and essentially just buying drinks

1007
01:33:17.90 --> 01:33:24.30
Right nightclub. Yes. There's no essential. That's what you're doing. Yeah, you throw it thinking back like thinking back

1008
01:33:25.18 --> 01:33:27.18
five years ago

1009
01:33:27.18 --> 01:33:28.14
You

1010
01:33:28.14 --> 01:33:32.62
Spend all your money not all your money, but you said a bunch of money on drinks and what I get

1011
01:33:33.02 --> 01:33:37.90
Literally nothing to show for it and in most cases you get there's it's gonna mess you up in one way

1012
01:33:37.90 --> 01:33:40.46
Yeah, you can do something you regret or whatever potentially

1013
01:33:41.26 --> 01:33:47.18
So think of that same five years and be like dang what if I started these two things that in my

1014
01:33:47.18 --> 01:33:51.90
You know prediction is gonna help me in five years and let's say you did that five years ago

1015
01:33:51.90 --> 01:33:55.90
And you did it. I don't know you even practice it like an hour a day whatever it is

1016
01:33:56.22 --> 01:33:58.22
Even just improving your knowledge on

1017
01:33:58.62 --> 01:34:03.58
The economy or something. I don't know anything anything anything that improves your knowledge five years later

1018
01:34:04.06 --> 01:34:10.46
You could you could be essentially an expert at it absolutely no now just consider now what is it

1019
01:34:11.18 --> 01:34:15.34
That you should have got into because you probably have a handful of interests that are pretty cool to you

1020
01:34:15.34 --> 01:34:17.34
Even if it's like playing a tar on on whatever

1021
01:34:17.98 --> 01:34:21.98
But if you can make it something that you can anticipate in five years it's gonna be

1022
01:34:22.38 --> 01:34:25.50
You're if you're talking about financial stuff. It's gonna help you make money

1023
01:34:26.62 --> 01:34:30.38
Didn't do that do that yeah, don't and I

1024
01:34:30.94 --> 01:34:36.54
I harp on reality TV a lot but I think it kind of deserves it because you don't learn much reality TV

1025
01:34:36.54 --> 01:34:38.54
Yeah, you lost like that hour and

1026
01:34:39.42 --> 01:34:42.62
If you spent that hour and

1027
01:34:42.62 --> 01:34:48.70
Really you could kind of keep watching out if you want but just spend that one hour doing something that you anticipate

1028
01:34:49.10 --> 01:34:52.22
If you're really good at it would help you financially

1029
01:34:52.78 --> 01:34:57.42
Do that thing for one hour and then I like it one day is gonna come you're gonna think back

1030
01:34:57.42 --> 01:35:02.86
Oh, just the same way I'm thinking back a little five years ago. I mean in my case is one of five years ago, but

1031
01:35:03.58 --> 01:35:08.30
Just the same way I'm thinking back of those people at the night club industry the same way I'm thinking back about that

1032
01:35:08.46 --> 01:35:10.86
You're gonna be thinking back at yourself and you'd be like dang

1033
01:35:10.86 --> 01:35:15.66
I'm so happy I got into that you know yeah and there's all kinds of things you could have done

1034
01:35:15.66 --> 01:35:19.50
I mean I look at the money I wasted over the years in the bars

1035
01:35:19.90 --> 01:35:24.62
It's ridiculous you know been a young seal out getting after it with the boys

1036
01:35:25.34 --> 01:35:30.06
Thursday Friday Saturday and the Sunday that's how we used to roll

1037
01:35:30.38 --> 01:35:36.14
Yeah, that's how we used to roll and it was just hey we'd show up. I'm the richest guy in the world

1038
01:35:36.14 --> 01:35:39.74
Yeah, I have all the money that I ever need and I can buy whatever I want

1039
01:35:39.74 --> 01:35:46.54
That's what every night was like so not wise don't do that. Yeah, and I'll even

1040
01:35:48.30 --> 01:35:55.02
All you have some fun it's cool you can still right and I'm just saying think of that yeah think of what you're doing right now

1041
01:35:55.02 --> 01:35:59.82
And you because for these people and for these people I was talking about back when he's working nightclub industry

1042
01:36:00.14 --> 01:36:03.82
They are really technically they are committed to spending their money

1043
01:36:04.46 --> 01:36:06.46
Committed to it. Yeah if you're doing something

1044
01:36:06.46 --> 01:36:10.86
To do every single week for years you're committed to it

1045
01:36:11.98 --> 01:36:17.98
So just take one of those hours yeah or take maybe 10% of that money that you're spending or 25% all of it

1046
01:36:17.98 --> 01:36:21.82
Whatever and put it in something that you anticipate in the other thing is I mean

1047
01:36:22.14 --> 01:36:25.82
Investing yourself is like actually build something actually build a little company

1048
01:36:25.82 --> 01:36:29.98
You know make something that's what that that's what I was meant you've got another perspective

1049
01:36:29.98 --> 01:36:33.42
Which is also very viable and makes just as much sense

1050
01:36:33.42 --> 01:36:36.54
I was literally talking about you know

1051
01:36:36.94 --> 01:36:41.66
From your perspective. Oh, you like guitar's cool figure out how to make a cool guitar stand at your house

1052
01:36:41.82 --> 01:36:44.38
You know and then see if you can get that thing

1053
01:36:45.18 --> 01:36:48.70
Produced and then oh, it's really good maybe we start running production

1054
01:36:49.74 --> 01:36:56.22
Let's do that that is in for not only not only were you possibly end up with a some kind of a product that sells

1055
01:36:56.86 --> 01:37:00.22
But you'll have run on something you've had fun you created something for the world

1056
01:37:00.22 --> 01:37:05.10
You've learned the lessons that you learned about building it in getting math here. That's all gonna be worth while as well

1057
01:37:05.66 --> 01:37:09.50
So there's no this this I'm not saying this

1058
01:37:10.54 --> 01:37:12.94
With regards to that you're gonna

1059
01:37:13.90 --> 01:37:18.22
Come up with this product and you're gonna get rich. It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen

1060
01:37:20.14 --> 01:37:22.78
But can you use that to build knowledge?

1061
01:37:22.78 --> 01:37:29.10
Can you use that to get gain experience that will then compound with other things in your life and

1062
01:37:29.10 --> 01:37:34.54
Eventually make you financially free because you had that discipline

1063
01:37:35.42 --> 01:37:37.42
Absolutely

1064
01:37:43.02 --> 01:37:45.02
Next question

1065
01:37:45.82 --> 01:37:48.46
Does micromanaging ever work?

1066
01:37:51.18 --> 01:37:52.86
Well

1067
01:37:52.86 --> 01:38:00.14
Yes, and and more importantly does it work yes sometimes it works and more importantly sometimes you have to micromanage

1068
01:38:02.06 --> 01:38:04.46
So you get somebody that

1069
01:38:04.78 --> 01:38:07.58
Isn't good at their job doesn't do a good job doesn't show up doesn't

1070
01:38:08.30 --> 01:38:11.82
Run things right of course. You know how you fix them you got to get in a micromanage

1071
01:38:11.82 --> 01:38:14.70
Well first of all you can't do mission failure. So you got to get in the micromanage

1072
01:38:15.26 --> 01:38:20.86
Once you're done micromanaging or or once you've got them up to speed then you can stop micromanaging

1073
01:38:20.86 --> 01:38:22.86
This is this is

1074
01:38:23.34 --> 01:38:30.46
Totally good to go and even if you ask life or you know the other between commanders at work from you or assistant between commanders at work for me

1075
01:38:32.38 --> 01:38:39.50
If when we when they got to know me when they met me I was micromanage master because I'm in their grill

1076
01:38:39.50 --> 01:38:42.70
Hey, this you got to do this note come over here a little bit. No and wouldn't give me some

1077
01:38:42.70 --> 01:38:47.82
But then as soon as I see that they get it of course then it's like okay you got this you got this and I'm gonna

1078
01:38:47.82 --> 01:38:53.02
I'm gonna macromanage and barely manage and let them run with it and so that's

1079
01:38:53.98 --> 01:38:57.90
That's absolutely micromanagement is sometimes it's a necessity and

1080
01:38:58.54 --> 01:39:01.58
By the way if you're getting micromanaged

1081
01:39:02.22 --> 01:39:06.14
That's a little bit of a red flag sure you might have somebody that's a control freak that is a

1082
01:39:06.38 --> 01:39:08.22
Compulsive micromanager and that sucks

1083
01:39:08.38 --> 01:39:10.70
But you also might have somebody that doesn't trust you yet

1084
01:39:10.70 --> 01:39:15.26
And so how do you build up their trust? Is it by hiding from them? No, it's by being open and being like hey boss

1085
01:39:15.26 --> 01:39:19.90
There's what I'm gonna do you actually send them more information than they could even want you show them how

1086
01:39:19.98 --> 01:39:25.82
Response play you are you show them what a handle you have on the situation and that's how you can help overcome the micromanage

1087
01:39:25.82 --> 01:39:30.86
But if someone's not doing what they're supposed to or they're failing or they're letting you down

1088
01:39:30.86 --> 01:39:32.86
Then yeah, you got to get in their grill and micromanage

1089
01:39:33.58 --> 01:39:39.02
The other time that and I sort of said this is when you're mentoring someone that can also be viewed as micromanagement

1090
01:39:39.34 --> 01:39:41.26
Because now I'm sitting side by side

1091
01:39:41.26 --> 01:39:45.66
I'm my breathing down your neck a little bit and that might be viewed as micromanagement

1092
01:39:45.74 --> 01:39:48.62
But again, sometimes it's necessary if you don't know the ropes yet

1093
01:39:48.62 --> 01:39:51.10
I got to show you the ropes. I mean, I got to sit by you and make sure you know it

1094
01:39:52.30 --> 01:39:58.06
Teaching so if you're teaching somebody something in a work environment that can also be viewed as micromanagement

1095
01:39:58.06 --> 01:40:01.66
And it actually is because you're saying hey put this over here put that over here wait

1096
01:40:02.78 --> 01:40:06.94
Back off let me do this no no you don't know how to do it. I got to show you how to do it so

1097
01:40:06.94 --> 01:40:13.10
There's that and then that's teaching and then sometimes you got to show people how to do it

1098
01:40:13.10 --> 01:40:17.90
And I told that long story in here one time where I just said hey you sit and watch how I'm gonna run this squad

1099
01:40:18.78 --> 01:40:23.26
And I ran the squad and got fired up and told people where to go and moved on the line and

1100
01:40:23.82 --> 01:40:28.30
The two commander looked at me and said okay, I can do that and as soon as you saw one time he got it so

1101
01:40:29.26 --> 01:40:35.50
That's sometimes micromanagement is okay the thing is you don't want to get stuck in the rut of micromanagement

1102
01:40:35.50 --> 01:40:39.02
So if I mentor you if I teach you if I instruct you if I show you the way

1103
01:40:39.26 --> 01:40:42.70
Doesn't mean stay there and keep micromanaging because you're not doing your job

1104
01:40:43.34 --> 01:40:49.10
You shouldn't have the capability or the capacity to micromanagement to micromanage everybody that works for you

1105
01:40:49.34 --> 01:40:52.86
If you have that ability you're not doing your job. You're not looking up the chain of command

1106
01:40:52.86 --> 01:40:58.70
You're not looking out your troopers your subordinate leadership should be stepping up and leading and you should

1107
01:40:59.10 --> 01:41:02.78
Expect that of them and if you have to micromanagement

1108
01:41:02.78 --> 01:41:08.30
It should be a chore that you don't like doing and when you get in there and you micromanage for a certain amount of time

1109
01:41:08.30 --> 01:41:11.18
Then you say okay you got this you know, I'm

1110
01:41:12.14 --> 01:41:17.10
I'm stepping back and then you got to step back because no one likes to be micromanaged

1111
01:41:17.74 --> 01:41:23.02
So once you get people up to speed step back let them run let your leaders lead

1112
01:41:23.02 --> 01:41:30.86
Yeah, sometimes people who like to micromanage or they feel compelled to

1113
01:41:33.50 --> 01:41:38.30
They can fall in that trap where where let's say they do need to micromanage and they'll get that payoff of oh

1114
01:41:38.30 --> 01:41:42.86
Yeah, I see this guy kind of getting it but instead of understanding the full scope of things

1115
01:41:42.86 --> 01:41:46.14
We're oh he's getting it now. I need to I don't need to manage as much

1116
01:41:46.70 --> 01:41:52.14
They'll be like they'll still start chasing that payoff of them getting it with their little micromanage

1117
01:41:52.14 --> 01:41:57.66
You know, so they'll like constantly need that payoff yeah some people now that you mentioned some people micromanage because they're ego

1118
01:41:58.46 --> 01:42:04.30
Though they want to they want to exercise they want to do two things exercise their power over the person

1119
01:42:04.86 --> 01:42:05.90
or

1120
01:42:05.90 --> 01:42:06.86
Or

1121
01:42:06.86 --> 01:42:11.42
Show off their knowledge to the person yeah, so those two are just such a pain

1122
01:42:12.46 --> 01:42:14.70
Such a pain, but you know what what do you do?

1123
01:42:15.02 --> 01:42:17.90
Okay cool. I'm gonna work harder. I'm gonna be ahead of you

1124
01:42:18.06 --> 01:42:20.06
I'm gonna get better at this and we're gonna move on

1125
01:42:20.06 --> 01:42:26.54
Yeah, that that showing off knowledge thing that that that it's in a micromanagement situation

1126
01:42:26.54 --> 01:42:30.54
It seems like okay, it's obviously shouldn't do that and you can probably see it from a malo

1127
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:35.58
But but just in everyday life, that's a compelling thing to want to show people you ever

1128
01:42:35.98 --> 01:42:39.66
Ever hear someone telling you something that you already know and you just want to tell them

1129
01:42:39.66 --> 01:42:46.06
I already know I know you know like you don't have to explain it to me when really when you really kind of search your own feelings

1130
01:42:46.06 --> 01:42:51.50
It's not that they're wasting your time. It's kind of that you just want to let them know that I have that knowledge

1131
01:42:51.50 --> 01:42:55.18
Don't worry about you know, I mean, but I see that all the time. I feel that all the time

1132
01:42:56.06 --> 01:42:57.90
Just gotta like fight your tongue

1133
01:42:57.90 --> 01:43:03.10
Right, but I think that's that's a real compelling like desire, you know to

1134
01:43:04.06 --> 01:43:07.82
To show hey, already know that or look how much I know you know

1135
01:43:07.82 --> 01:43:17.66
Yeah, people definitely like that. It makes me feel good and look at what I know you know

1136
01:43:17.82 --> 01:43:18.38
Last question

1137
01:43:19.10 --> 01:43:20.86
Joko

1138
01:43:20.86 --> 01:43:25.26
Focus in a battle is easy how do you keep focus in a long war?

1139
01:43:27.18 --> 01:43:29.18
I eat long term goals

1140
01:43:32.06 --> 01:43:34.06
Well

1141
01:43:34.06 --> 01:43:37.26
that that can definitely be true

1142
01:43:38.38 --> 01:43:44.22
It can be pretty easy to focus on the battle that's right in front of your face

1143
01:43:46.14 --> 01:43:52.38
And when you're doing that sometimes you can look track of the long term goal

1144
01:43:53.90 --> 01:43:56.86
But I want to have that

1145
01:43:57.82 --> 01:44:01.18
That long term goal so

1146
01:44:01.18 --> 01:44:05.50
In bed it in my mind that I never lose side of it

1147
01:44:06.86 --> 01:44:08.86
Ever

1148
01:44:08.86 --> 01:44:18.22
And those little tasks and projects and short term goals that you tackle they need to lead toward that strategic victory

1149
01:44:19.90 --> 01:44:21.90
Winning the long war

1150
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:26.30
And we get very caught up in

1151
01:44:26.30 --> 01:44:30.14
Instant gratification we want results now

1152
01:44:31.34 --> 01:44:35.58
We want the short cut to the winner's podium

1153
01:44:39.34 --> 01:44:40.38
And

1154
01:44:40.38 --> 01:44:42.30
Sometimes you know when we don't get that

1155
01:44:43.50 --> 01:44:46.14
Short term glory that we want we

1156
01:44:47.10 --> 01:44:54.22
lose track of those long term goals and you you look up in in six weeks or

1157
01:44:54.22 --> 01:44:58.38
In six months or in six years and

1158
01:44:59.74 --> 01:45:01.74
You've made no progress

1159
01:45:03.26 --> 01:45:05.26
None

1160
01:45:05.74 --> 01:45:07.74
You never moved

1161
01:45:08.70 --> 01:45:13.90
You might even be further from your goal than you were

1162
01:45:13.90 --> 01:45:15.90
Why?

1163
01:45:22.22 --> 01:45:24.22
Why

1164
01:45:25.02 --> 01:45:27.02
Why did you let that happen?

1165
01:45:29.82 --> 01:45:33.34
Because you lost sight of that long term goal

1166
01:45:35.50 --> 01:45:42.06
And at some point after you lose sight of that goal and years have gone by you think to yourself

1167
01:45:42.06 --> 01:45:44.06
Maybe I can't

1168
01:45:46.30 --> 01:45:48.30
Maybe I can't do it

1169
01:45:50.30 --> 01:45:52.30
And so you give up

1170
01:45:52.70 --> 01:45:54.70
You let it fade

1171
01:45:58.14 --> 01:46:00.14
And you settle

1172
01:46:01.98 --> 01:46:07.58
You settle for mediocrity you settle forever you settle for oh well

1173
01:46:07.58 --> 01:46:09.58
No

1174
01:46:11.34 --> 01:46:13.34
But no

1175
01:46:13.34 --> 01:46:15.34
No

1176
01:46:15.34 --> 01:46:17.34
Don't do that

1177
01:46:18.22 --> 01:46:23.58
In bed that long term goal in your mind burn it into your soul

1178
01:46:25.10 --> 01:46:29.42
Think about it and write about it and talk about it and hang it up on your wall

1179
01:46:29.58 --> 01:46:32.06
But most important do something about it

1180
01:46:34.06 --> 01:46:36.46
Do something about it every day

1181
01:46:36.46 --> 01:46:44.86
Every day do something that moves you toward that goal that keeps the goal alive and in sight and in focus

1182
01:46:48.38 --> 01:46:50.14
However

1183
01:46:50.14 --> 01:46:57.18
However small or insignificant that step might seem take it do it to that little piece

1184
01:46:58.30 --> 01:47:00.30
make it happen

1185
01:47:02.30 --> 01:47:04.30
Because

1186
01:47:04.30 --> 01:47:06.30
that goal

1187
01:47:06.30 --> 01:47:08.30
Isn't going to achieve

1188
01:47:09.02 --> 01:47:11.02
itself

1189
01:47:13.18 --> 01:47:14.54
It's all

1190
01:47:16.62 --> 01:47:18.62
you

1191
01:47:22.30 --> 01:47:25.66
And I think that's all I've got for the night

1192
01:47:26.70 --> 01:47:28.70
Which means

1193
01:47:29.34 --> 01:47:31.34
It's time to wrap it up

1194
01:47:32.38 --> 01:47:34.38
Echo what else do we have

1195
01:47:34.38 --> 01:47:39.34

01:50:08.78 --> 01:50:10.78
Which we talked about today?

01:50:10.78 --> 01:50:14.62
What is the what is sort of the the most popular of the t-shirts?

01:50:15.10 --> 01:50:16.62
It goes in waves

1230
01:50:16.62 --> 01:50:20.06
So I'd say generally speaking discipline equals freedom

1231
01:50:20.06 --> 01:50:23.98
Is the is the solid seller yeah, and that makes sense because

1232
01:50:25.42 --> 01:50:32.30
Again like that's the mantra yeah, and and that's not it seems like oh it's kind of intriguing as of a thing like

1233
01:50:33.26 --> 01:50:36.78
Discipline equals freedom is kind of counterintuitive, but when you really think about it

1234
01:50:36.78 --> 01:50:40.86
I don't know it's kind of impactful. I think it's a good thing to live by you know

1235
01:50:40.86 --> 01:50:44.38
I agree with you nonetheless, so maybe that's why I don't know and then

1236
01:50:46.06 --> 01:50:48.06
The good one is kind of cool

1237
01:50:48.06 --> 01:50:50.06
