00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.20
This is Jocco podcast number 131.

2
00:00:04.20 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Winning.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40
Good evening, I come.

4
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.40
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.40 --> 00:00:10.80
It is time for some Q&A.

6
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:11.80
Yes.

7
00:00:11.80 --> 00:00:15.20
To be banter around for a while, she just gets started.

8
00:00:15.20 --> 00:00:17.20
Question number one.

9
00:00:17.20 --> 00:00:22.40
I've been somewhat of a pushover for the majority of my life.

10
00:00:22.40 --> 00:00:25.44
Since listening to the podcast, I've been trying to assert myself more.

11
00:00:25.44 --> 00:00:29.96
One thing I can't seem to shake is constantly being interrupted.

12
00:00:29.96 --> 00:00:33.56
How can I rise above and overcome this obstacle?

13
00:00:33.56 --> 00:00:36.56
Should I read the hashtag?

14
00:00:36.56 --> 00:00:38.16
The hashtag fellow hardcore.

15
00:00:38.16 --> 00:00:39.16
Okay.

16
00:00:39.16 --> 00:00:40.16
There you go.

17
00:00:40.16 --> 00:00:44.56
There's a little layer in there because you put rise above and there.

18
00:00:44.56 --> 00:00:54.04
So I thought about this because I would say I don't get interrupted a lot.

19
00:00:54.04 --> 00:00:59.24
But I think that's kind of the current state of me.

20
00:00:59.24 --> 00:01:01.84
I think there's a reason why I don't get interrupted a lot.

21
00:01:01.84 --> 00:01:05.24
And it's not because people are going to think, well, that's because you're going to

22
00:01:05.24 --> 00:01:09.32
bash people in the head with a club.

23
00:01:09.32 --> 00:01:12.64
That's not the actual answer of why I'm looking interrupted.

24
00:01:12.64 --> 00:01:17.28
So one thing I think is important is, you've heard me say this before, the less people

25
00:01:17.28 --> 00:01:19.40
talk, the more people listen.

26
00:01:19.40 --> 00:01:24.56
So when I'm in a group of people that all want to talk and I want to talk over each

27
00:01:24.56 --> 00:01:28.36
other and they want to cut each other off, you get in that group right there.

28
00:01:28.36 --> 00:01:30.80
I don't talk.

29
00:01:30.80 --> 00:01:31.80
I don't talk.

30
00:01:31.80 --> 00:01:36.20
I let there's, I sit there, I listen to them and I plot.

31
00:01:36.20 --> 00:01:43.36
Then I think and I put together my thoughts correctly so that when I do decide to say something,

32
00:01:43.36 --> 00:01:46.64
it's going to have impact.

33
00:01:46.64 --> 00:01:48.24
And then I wait for the right moment.

34
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:53.16
Because if there's people going to be agreeing back and forth, I wait for a low in the

35
00:01:53.16 --> 00:02:02.12
fire and when that low comes, then I make my point in a very direct manner.

36
00:02:02.12 --> 00:02:07.48
I might even have to wait until the conversation is like all but over, wait till they're

37
00:02:07.48 --> 00:02:10.84
done with their little fire fight.

38
00:02:10.84 --> 00:02:23.80
And then I'm going to talk.

39
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:26.64
Since I've been thinking about it, it's going to be articulated in a way that I can present

40
00:02:26.64 --> 00:02:29.20
my full point.

41
00:02:29.20 --> 00:02:32.16
So I think that's an effective way to do things.

42
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:37.52
I think if you let people speak a bunch, you let them get it out of their system and then

43
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:40.08
when you decide to talk, they don't have anything left to say.

44
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:41.56
So that's a way to stop getting cut off.

45
00:02:41.56 --> 00:02:43.56
So this is almost like flanking, right?

46
00:02:43.56 --> 00:02:48.36
This is flanking the fact that when people have a bunch to say and they got all these thoughts

47
00:02:48.36 --> 00:02:51.04
in their head and they want to get them all out, let them get them out.

48
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:52.64
Don't try and fight that battle.

49
00:02:52.64 --> 00:02:54.04
They've got a bunch of things they want to say.

50
00:02:54.04 --> 00:02:55.04
Let them say it.

51
00:02:55.04 --> 00:03:03.84
Also, as we know, when you listen to someone else talk, you now know what their ideas are.

52
00:03:03.84 --> 00:03:04.84
You know what they're thinking.

53
00:03:04.84 --> 00:03:08.52
There's a power and not saying anything because it allows you to think and it allows

54
00:03:08.52 --> 00:03:10.000
you to hear what other people think.

55
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.80
It allows you to hear other people's own conversation.

56
00:03:13.80 --> 00:03:17.48
You get to hear other people's counters to what people are saying.

57
00:03:17.48 --> 00:03:21.72
And you're not having to expend any ammunition yourself.

58
00:03:21.72 --> 00:03:22.72
Someone else is doing it.

59
00:03:22.72 --> 00:03:26.40
You know, the third or fourth or fifth piece person, the conversation that's expending ammunition

60
00:03:26.40 --> 00:03:31.20
and running their mouth to try and counter some point that someone's made.

61
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:32.20
Let them do that.

62
00:03:32.20 --> 00:03:35.20
Because by the way, then you get to see what the other counter is.

63
00:03:35.20 --> 00:03:40.96
So I think being assertive doesn't mean talking more.

64
00:03:40.96 --> 00:03:47.52
I think being assertive means talking less talking at the appropriate times, monitoring

65
00:03:47.52 --> 00:03:52.84
and understanding the firefight that's happening so that when other people have

66
00:03:52.84 --> 00:03:59.56
expended their ammunition, you can step in and you can take your shots in a simple clear

67
00:03:59.56 --> 00:04:01.56
concise manner.

68
00:04:01.56 --> 00:04:03.56
That's what I think.

69
00:04:03.56 --> 00:04:04.56
I think you're right.

70
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:07.04
I think you built up this reputation though.

71
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:10.08
That's a little added element to your specific situation.

72
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:15.96
Which is where when you talk it like you're not saying fluff, you know, when you talk

73
00:04:15.96 --> 00:04:16.96
it's like something.

74
00:04:16.96 --> 00:04:18.56
Well, that's a good point.

75
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:27.000
So if you don't want to get caught off and 70% of the things that you say aren't really

76
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.92
that impactful and don't add a lot to the conversation, well, then there's a good chance

77
00:04:30.92 --> 00:04:35.32
that when you open your mouth to start talking, someone else doesn't think it's going

78
00:04:35.32 --> 00:04:36.32
to be important.

79
00:04:36.32 --> 00:04:37.36
So they just jump right on top of you.

80
00:04:37.36 --> 00:04:42.04
But if you say less and to your point, if the things that you say generally are well

81
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:47.80
fought out and clear and are going to have impact, well, then we have a good chance that

82
00:04:47.80 --> 00:04:49.12
you're not going to be caught off.

83
00:04:49.12 --> 00:04:51.44
People actually want to hear what you're going to say.

84
00:04:51.44 --> 00:04:53.68
Yeah, don't talk just to talk ever.

85
00:04:53.68 --> 00:04:54.68
Yeah, I see.

86
00:04:54.68 --> 00:04:55.68
And that's a hard.

87
00:04:55.68 --> 00:04:57.56
I shouldn't say ever, but hardly ever.

88
00:04:57.56 --> 00:04:58.56
Yeah.

89
00:04:58.56 --> 00:05:00.72
Yeah, that's a hard one.

90
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:05.96
Because it's not like people are interrupting you on purpose because you don't have

91
00:05:05.96 --> 00:05:06.96
nothing to say.

92
00:05:06.96 --> 00:05:08.56
You're just talking fluff.

93
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:09.56
That's nice.

94
00:05:09.56 --> 00:05:10.56
Not a conscious on purpose thing.

95
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:11.56
A lot of the time.

96
00:05:11.56 --> 00:05:12.56
I think anyway.

97
00:05:12.56 --> 00:05:13.84
Don't feel like it is.

98
00:05:13.84 --> 00:05:16.64
It feels like subconscious.

99
00:05:16.64 --> 00:05:21.64
How can someone see fit to actually follow through with interrupting somebody if they don't

100
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:22.64
think?

101
00:05:22.64 --> 00:05:24.64
This isn't quite that important.

102
00:05:24.64 --> 00:05:28.64
At the very least, what I'm about to interrupt with is more important.

103
00:05:28.64 --> 00:05:32.08
So there's some people think that what they're about to say is really important.

104
00:05:32.08 --> 00:05:33.52
Yeah, here's another thing.

105
00:05:33.52 --> 00:05:35.52
It's like the little boy that cried wolf, right?

106
00:05:35.52 --> 00:05:43.08
If I talk and talk and talk and talk, I'm taking away the value of each one of those

107
00:05:43.08 --> 00:05:46.84
statements that I make because I'm making so many statements that not all of them can have

108
00:05:46.84 --> 00:05:48.56
a high level of value.

109
00:05:48.56 --> 00:05:53.96
So who do you pay more attention to?

110
00:05:53.96 --> 00:05:56.96
The person that makes 100 statements?

111
00:05:56.96 --> 00:05:57.96
And what are those?

112
00:05:57.96 --> 00:06:00.40
Okay, let's say you want to pay attention to the person that makes 100 statements.

113
00:06:00.40 --> 00:06:03.32
How much can you pay attention to those 100 statements?

114
00:06:03.32 --> 00:06:07.28
How much do you gather from those 100 statements?

115
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:09.92
It's limited amount.

116
00:06:09.92 --> 00:06:12.44
It's 1% per statement, right?

117
00:06:12.44 --> 00:06:13.44
What's 1%?

118
00:06:13.44 --> 00:06:15.64
You have to follow the, I make some of the statements.

119
00:06:15.64 --> 00:06:17.56
That's just 1% per statement.

120
00:06:17.56 --> 00:06:21.60
If the person says one thing, how much percent do you pay attention to that?

121
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:22.60
That's right.

122
00:06:22.60 --> 00:06:24.32
You said it all over the present.

123
00:06:24.32 --> 00:06:26.32
So there you go.

124
00:06:26.32 --> 00:06:29.84
I mean, since Jack, good luck with that fellow hardcore kid.

125
00:06:29.84 --> 00:06:34.60
So I guess he'd kind of have, I mean, assuming that, you know, we understand his situation,

126
00:06:34.60 --> 00:06:37.20
it's hard, overall.

127
00:06:37.20 --> 00:06:41.60
It's kind of like you have to build a reputation of saying only important things.

128
00:06:41.60 --> 00:06:44.08
That's a good way to, please, to start just be quiet.

129
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:45.08
There.

130
00:06:45.08 --> 00:06:48.92
And not only like exactly exactly what you said, that added thing which you kind of actually

131
00:06:48.92 --> 00:06:50.32
may have already said.

132
00:06:50.32 --> 00:06:54.76
But when you sit back and just listen to him, it'll cause you to have to say less because

133
00:06:54.76 --> 00:06:57.76
what if you wanted to like, oh, I was going to make this point.

134
00:06:57.76 --> 00:07:00.24
That's the feeling you get when you want to interrupt someone's like, oh, I want to make

135
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:01.24
this point right now.

136
00:07:01.24 --> 00:07:04.80
Kind of thing, you will find out you just let people talk, you don't have to make that

137
00:07:04.80 --> 00:07:05.80
point.

138
00:07:05.80 --> 00:07:06.80
They know this stuff.

139
00:07:06.80 --> 00:07:07.80
You know, all of it.

140
00:07:07.80 --> 00:07:09.44
And you'll find, that's probably a lot of the time.

141
00:07:09.44 --> 00:07:16.28
You know, and by the way, if I step into make a point that people already know, how

142
00:07:16.28 --> 00:07:21.04
impactful is that point, it's a very limited impact.

143
00:07:21.04 --> 00:07:25.28
So the more points that you can hear that you know and that everyone knows and that you don't

144
00:07:25.28 --> 00:07:27.28
have to say the better off you are.

145
00:07:27.28 --> 00:07:31.56
So when you do make a point and it's a point that no one really thought of how impactful

146
00:07:31.56 --> 00:07:32.56
is that point.

147
00:07:32.56 --> 00:07:34.000
The answer is it's very impactful.

148
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.84
Yeah, and it comes way more clear that it might be a point than no one thought of after

149
00:07:38.84 --> 00:07:41.000
you listen to everyone talk for how long.

150
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.44
Then if I go away this one that covered.

151
00:07:42.44 --> 00:07:45.36
So I can say that you have to say all these other things that I was done.

152
00:07:45.36 --> 00:07:47.16
Not about making an interrupt with or whatever.

153
00:07:47.16 --> 00:07:48.80
Yeah, just be quiet, right?

154
00:07:48.80 --> 00:07:49.80
Just be quiet.

155
00:07:49.80 --> 00:07:57.08
And in social situations, for example, to me and this is what I kind of started doing or

156
00:07:57.08 --> 00:08:01.32
try to start doing in social situations, you know how like a, okay, I listen to my wife

157
00:08:01.32 --> 00:08:05.24
and her friends talk and there is just a boom, boom, interrupting in a, it's not rude or

158
00:08:05.24 --> 00:08:06.24
nothing.

159
00:08:06.24 --> 00:08:08.32
It's just because they're just talking and yeah, that's how they roll.

160
00:08:08.32 --> 00:08:09.80
Yes, how they roll.

161
00:08:09.80 --> 00:08:15.44
And to the point where I'm getting like little mild micro doses of anxiety because of all

162
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:16.44
the interruptions.

163
00:08:16.44 --> 00:08:17.44
Yeah, it's like a lot.

164
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:18.44
They just talk a lot.

165
00:08:18.44 --> 00:08:19.44
That's what it is.

166
00:08:19.44 --> 00:08:25.84
Anyway, so I found in social situations, if I feel that, like if I'm like trying to talk

167
00:08:25.84 --> 00:08:29.96
or that I'm getting interrupted a lot a lot, man, in a way, they don't really care that

168
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:31.52
much about what you have to say.

169
00:08:31.52 --> 00:08:36.36
They have more like they care more about what they have to say.

170
00:08:36.36 --> 00:08:37.60
And it's a social situation.

171
00:08:37.60 --> 00:08:39.24
So yeah, you might as well just be quiet.

172
00:08:39.24 --> 00:08:46.000
You're adding less value interrupting their valuable stuff, you know, so you're be quiet.

173
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.12
And you'll find that they'll want to talk to you more too if you be quiet and not interrupt

174
00:08:49.12 --> 00:08:50.92
them.

175
00:08:50.92 --> 00:08:54.64
You might have to take some heavy on the interruptions front though, because that is kind

176
00:08:54.64 --> 00:08:56.32
of knowing if you pay attention to it.

177
00:08:56.32 --> 00:08:57.32
That's what I think.

178
00:08:57.32 --> 00:08:58.32
That's you.

179
00:08:58.32 --> 00:09:00.48
I see what you're doing, Anna.

180
00:09:00.48 --> 00:09:02.84
Next question.

181
00:09:02.84 --> 00:09:04.32
I saw your TED talk.

182
00:09:04.32 --> 00:09:06.76
I like most people have a boss.

183
00:09:06.76 --> 00:09:11.84
If it wasn't the fault of the guys below you and there are people above you, shouldn't

184
00:09:11.84 --> 00:09:13.44
they take ownership.

185
00:09:13.44 --> 00:09:19.20
IE, your commanding officer, and then it in turn his why would ownership only drift

186
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:22.32
halfway up.

187
00:09:22.32 --> 00:09:27.16
So in an ideal world, ownership goes up and down the chain of command.

188
00:09:27.16 --> 00:09:28.16
Absolutely.

189
00:09:28.16 --> 00:09:33.96
And that is how problems get solved because people take ownership of those problems throughout

190
00:09:33.96 --> 00:09:35.60
the chain of command.

191
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:40.36
Now does the world always work like that?

192
00:09:40.36 --> 00:09:41.36
No, it doesn't.

193
00:09:41.36 --> 00:09:42.36
That's okay.

194
00:09:42.36 --> 00:09:47.88
That's fine because as the boss of what year the boss of you can't make any excuses,

195
00:09:47.88 --> 00:09:49.64
that's the way it happens.

196
00:09:49.64 --> 00:09:54.92
And when an organization is taking ownership, when you've got a team where everyone is taking

197
00:09:54.92 --> 00:10:01.000
ownership on that team, there's absolutely overlap of everyone taking responsibility for

198
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the different problems.

199
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
There will be some overlap.

200
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.68
I could have done this to help out.

201
00:10:04.68 --> 00:10:07.16
Oh, yeah, I would have done this better now.

202
00:10:07.16 --> 00:10:08.80
We both solved the same problem.

203
00:10:08.80 --> 00:10:15.16
But it's redundant but good because now we got two people addressing the problem.

204
00:10:15.16 --> 00:10:16.32
So that's not a bad thing.

205
00:10:16.32 --> 00:10:19.60
So when people are taking ownership up and down the chain of command, the problems are getting

206
00:10:19.60 --> 00:10:24.76
not just solved by one angle, but by multiple different angles of everyone that's taking

207
00:10:24.76 --> 00:10:27.72
ownership of that problem.

208
00:10:27.72 --> 00:10:31.96
When the blue one blue happened, that I talked about extreme ownership that was in the

209
00:10:31.96 --> 00:10:33.72
TED Talk.

210
00:10:33.72 --> 00:10:38.52
And I talk about this, my guys took ownership of what they did wrong as well, the guy that

211
00:10:38.52 --> 00:10:45.68
shot the Iraqi soldier, the radio and took ownership of the fact that he didn't pass the

212
00:10:45.68 --> 00:10:46.68
word quick enough.

213
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:49.96
The element leader took ownership of the fact that the Iraqi said, got in a way from

214
00:10:49.96 --> 00:10:51.24
him.

215
00:10:51.24 --> 00:10:54.16
They all owned their little pieces.

216
00:10:54.16 --> 00:10:57.68
And of course, I owned it as well.

217
00:10:57.68 --> 00:11:03.16
And when I took ownership of everything, it wasn't like those guys then said, okay, well,

218
00:11:03.16 --> 00:11:05.04
then I'm absolved and I don't have to change anything.

219
00:11:05.04 --> 00:11:09.84
No, no, no, let's get still realized that they made some mistakes and some things that

220
00:11:09.84 --> 00:11:10.72
they need to clean up.

221
00:11:10.72 --> 00:11:12.96
So I took ownership of the same thing.

222
00:11:12.96 --> 00:11:14.36
They were taking ownership and guess what?

223
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:18.32
Then again, it was redundant that we were all trying to solve the problems.

224
00:11:18.32 --> 00:11:19.92
Now, this is the opposite.

225
00:11:19.92 --> 00:11:20.92
This doesn't happen.

226
00:11:20.92 --> 00:11:22.92
When you start blaming people, everyone makes excuses.

227
00:11:22.92 --> 00:11:25.88
That's just the way it works.

228
00:11:25.88 --> 00:11:29.24
So I think that that's what you have to think about.

229
00:11:29.24 --> 00:11:35.28
So like I said, ideally, when a leader takes ownership, so do the people up and down the

230
00:11:35.28 --> 00:11:37.32
chain of command.

231
00:11:37.32 --> 00:11:40.92
They also take ownership of the problems that if they do, that's great.

232
00:11:40.92 --> 00:11:45.40
And the leader can then monitor what those people up and down the chain of command, do

233
00:11:45.40 --> 00:11:47.92
to fix the problem.

234
00:11:47.92 --> 00:11:50.08
And if they fix the problems, then that's great.

235
00:11:50.08 --> 00:11:51.24
That's the way it works.

236
00:11:51.24 --> 00:11:56.28
And if they don't fix the problems, then that's when the leader has to own it up and down

237
00:11:56.28 --> 00:11:59.96
the chain of command, then it still will be responsible and take ownership of fixing

238
00:11:59.96 --> 00:12:02.96
the problem.

239
00:12:02.96 --> 00:12:14.28
So the other piece of this, I guess, is that that's why extreme ownership works.

240
00:12:14.28 --> 00:12:19.44
It works because people that don't take ownership again up or down the chain of command,

241
00:12:19.44 --> 00:12:26.24
they will end up being overrun by the people that take ownership of the chain of command.

242
00:12:26.24 --> 00:12:28.40
Take ownership.

243
00:12:28.40 --> 00:12:34.80
It might not happen immediately, but eventually the people that make excuses will be overrun

244
00:12:34.80 --> 00:12:36.24
by the people that take ownership.

245
00:12:36.24 --> 00:12:37.48
That's the way it works.

246
00:12:37.48 --> 00:12:43.12
And by the way, and again, I talked about this in the TED talk, when that whole thing happened

247
00:12:43.12 --> 00:12:49.20
and I took ownership of it, my boss then trusted me more, not less.

248
00:12:49.20 --> 00:12:52.000
And that's what happens.

249
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.44
You end up increasing your trust.

250
00:12:55.44 --> 00:13:00.60
So take ownership.

251
00:13:00.60 --> 00:13:03.44
If your boss takes ownership too, that's awesome.

252
00:13:03.44 --> 00:13:05.08
That's awesome.

253
00:13:05.08 --> 00:13:09.24
That means you've got multiple people trying to solve the problem, which is good for the

254
00:13:09.24 --> 00:13:11.76
team.

255
00:13:11.76 --> 00:13:13.68
You guys get asked this a lot.

256
00:13:13.68 --> 00:13:16.20
For some reason, life gets asked this a lot.

257
00:13:16.20 --> 00:13:23.80
Where it's a lot, like almost every single time I see life in a question answering situation.

258
00:13:23.80 --> 00:13:28.80
They say, what do I do or what happens when my boss isn't taking ownership?

259
00:13:28.80 --> 00:13:31.80
Or what do I do when my whatever isn't taking ownership?

260
00:13:31.80 --> 00:13:36.76
The question is ultimately, what do I do when the other guy isn't taking ownership?

261
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:41.08
See how you're smiling right now because we all get asked so obviously, essentially, that's

262
00:13:41.08 --> 00:13:42.08
what this is.

263
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:45.44
He's not in the scenario, so it's not.

264
00:13:45.44 --> 00:13:50.40
And how you guys always say, it's like, the thing is, extreme ownership isn't about

265
00:13:50.40 --> 00:13:52.80
the other guy taking ownership or not taking ownership.

266
00:13:52.80 --> 00:13:56.56
That's about everything you can personally do to take ownership.

267
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:57.56
That's it.

268
00:13:57.56 --> 00:13:59.12
It stops right there.

269
00:13:59.12 --> 00:14:00.76
No, just like what you said.

270
00:14:00.76 --> 00:14:03.60
If everyone else is taking ownership, which will happen because it's kind of this weird

271
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:05.76
contagious kind of thing.

272
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:08.36
And I don't want to throw it out there like, oh, if I take ownership, then everyone's

273
00:14:08.36 --> 00:14:09.36
automatically right.

274
00:14:09.36 --> 00:14:11.12
That doesn't happen because they'll be not those that don't.

275
00:14:11.12 --> 00:14:13.04
There's some people that are not looking to take ownership.

276
00:14:13.04 --> 00:14:15.40
And again, those that people that will eventually get overwhelmed.

277
00:14:15.40 --> 00:14:16.40
Yes.

278
00:14:16.40 --> 00:14:17.40
Because who do you want working for you?

279
00:14:17.40 --> 00:14:18.80
The guy that says, oh, this one's a my fault.

280
00:14:18.80 --> 00:14:19.80
No, it doesn't.

281
00:14:19.80 --> 00:14:22.64
If you want that guy working for you because that person not going to change, and I'm

282
00:14:22.64 --> 00:14:25.000
going to do anything different, they're not going to get that problem solved.

283
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.12
You want the person working for you that says, you know what, this is my fault.

284
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:29.24
This is what I'm going to do to fix it.

285
00:14:29.24 --> 00:14:30.24
Here we go.

286
00:14:30.24 --> 00:14:31.24
You go, okay.

287
00:14:31.24 --> 00:14:32.80
Well, let's you continue to do your job.

288
00:14:32.80 --> 00:14:34.56
And I want you to continue to do your job.

289
00:14:34.56 --> 00:14:37.68
And by the way, when a promotion opportunity comes up, guess who I'm promoting?

290
00:14:37.68 --> 00:14:40.68
The guy that makes a bunch of excuses and blames other people, the guy that takes ownership

291
00:14:40.68 --> 00:14:41.68
and gets problems solved.

292
00:14:41.68 --> 00:14:42.68
There you go.

293
00:14:42.68 --> 00:14:43.68
It's a no-brainer.

294
00:14:43.68 --> 00:14:48.12
And I think as people see that in an organization, the majority of people.

295
00:14:48.12 --> 00:14:53.20
Now this I will say, the majority of people, they will also take ownership.

296
00:14:53.20 --> 00:14:56.56
There will be a minority of people that go, oh, I'm going to slough off and I'm going to

297
00:14:56.56 --> 00:14:57.56
keep blaming other people.

298
00:14:57.56 --> 00:15:00.20
And in their minds, they think they look good, right?

299
00:15:00.20 --> 00:15:02.88
In my mind, when I go, when it was my fault, it was echo's fault.

300
00:15:02.88 --> 00:15:05.04
I think I saved myself for the blame.

301
00:15:05.04 --> 00:15:07.88
What I really did was look like an excuse making little baby.

302
00:15:07.88 --> 00:15:10.12
And I don't want to promote me.

303
00:15:10.12 --> 00:15:11.32
Because I know it wasn't my fault.

304
00:15:11.32 --> 00:15:13.20
Oh, the podcast income was my fault.

305
00:15:13.20 --> 00:15:14.20
Is echo's fault.

306
00:15:14.20 --> 00:15:15.20
Oh, really?

307
00:15:15.20 --> 00:15:16.20
Okay.

308
00:15:16.20 --> 00:15:17.56
Well, let's think about that.

309
00:15:17.56 --> 00:15:18.56
Do you want, who's a loser?

310
00:15:18.56 --> 00:15:19.56
Who's responsible?

311
00:15:19.56 --> 00:15:22.88
I'm shirking their responsibility and fling it on some other person.

312
00:15:22.88 --> 00:15:24.88
I don't want that person working for me.

313
00:15:24.88 --> 00:15:26.88
No.

314
00:15:26.88 --> 00:15:28.08
So that's why it works.

315
00:15:28.08 --> 00:15:29.08
Yeah.

316
00:15:29.08 --> 00:15:30.36
And I'm scared of it.

317
00:15:30.36 --> 00:15:35.08
People are scared that, well, if I take the blame, I'm going to look bad.

318
00:15:35.08 --> 00:15:36.88
You look bad when you don't take the blame.

319
00:15:36.88 --> 00:15:38.52
That's when you look bad.

320
00:15:38.52 --> 00:15:42.76
Yeah, pretty much any time, in one wearing another, pretty much any time you look at other

321
00:15:42.76 --> 00:15:45.08
people and be like, hey, what about them?

322
00:15:45.08 --> 00:15:47.32
You know, in this extreme ownership situation.

323
00:15:47.32 --> 00:15:52.04
Like, it goes against the very nature of extreme ownership to ask, like, hey, what about

324
00:15:52.04 --> 00:15:53.04
them?

325
00:15:53.04 --> 00:15:54.24
Why didn't they take responsibility?

326
00:15:54.24 --> 00:15:57.32
Just like, I mean, back to the questions, kind of like, just to kind of get a handle

327
00:15:57.32 --> 00:16:00.72
on understanding what extreme ownership is.

328
00:16:00.72 --> 00:16:03.20
If you start to incorporate, hey, what about them?

329
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:04.20
Hey, what about the higher-ups?

330
00:16:04.20 --> 00:16:06.52
Why should the ownership stop at you?

331
00:16:06.52 --> 00:16:07.52
Well, here's the thing.

332
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:08.52
It doesn't begin.

333
00:16:08.52 --> 00:16:11.28
It begins and stops at me.

334
00:16:11.28 --> 00:16:13.32
That's 100% of what it is.

335
00:16:13.32 --> 00:16:17.84
Now, other people, I mean, if I can step out of my own situation of extreme ownership

336
00:16:17.84 --> 00:16:22.56
and just kind of evaluate other people when they see you or feel you or see you taking ownership

337
00:16:22.56 --> 00:16:25.44
of stuff, I think it tends to be contagious.

338
00:16:25.44 --> 00:16:26.84
Like, this is, no, absolutely.

339
00:16:26.84 --> 00:16:30.24
That's what I just said, the majority of people with you take ownership.

340
00:16:30.24 --> 00:16:33.16
When I take ownership of something, if I go echo, you know, this is my fault that the

341
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:34.16
podcast didn't come out.

342
00:16:34.16 --> 00:16:35.16
Whatever.

343
00:16:35.16 --> 00:16:36.92
This is my fault that we didn't get this done.

344
00:16:36.92 --> 00:16:39.36
Your tendency isn't to go, oh, cool.

345
00:16:39.36 --> 00:16:40.36
It's Joc was fault.

346
00:16:40.36 --> 00:16:41.36
Yeah, I agree with you.

347
00:16:41.36 --> 00:16:43.88
You go, no, man, I should have done this or I should have done that.

348
00:16:43.88 --> 00:16:47.16
And now, once again, we're both trying to solve the problem.

349
00:16:47.16 --> 00:16:48.60
That's the way I usually end up.

350
00:16:48.60 --> 00:16:49.60
Yeah.

351
00:16:49.60 --> 00:16:54.52
Really interesting, how like Jamie, you know, you know, you're with Jamie, you're Jamie.

352
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:55.52
That's fun.

353
00:16:55.52 --> 00:17:00.20
And she'll, like, all make some mistake, you know, on the spelling of something, on

354
00:17:00.20 --> 00:17:01.80
some video, I don't know something.

355
00:17:01.80 --> 00:17:04.12
And she'll, she's real good at taking ownership.

356
00:17:04.12 --> 00:17:06.84
She's like, oh, you know, I should have, you know, whatever, whatever.

357
00:17:06.84 --> 00:17:09.12
And to the point, something, I was like, I see what you're doing.

358
00:17:09.12 --> 00:17:10.12
And it's true.

359
00:17:10.12 --> 00:17:15.88
Like any feeling of like, oh, oh, I should, you know, excuse me, you know, whatever.

360
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:17.44
Any feeling of that gone.

361
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:18.92
When someone is like, I don't know, it's my fault.

362
00:17:18.92 --> 00:17:19.92
I should have caught that.

363
00:17:19.92 --> 00:17:21.08
Or what do you, you should have caught that.

364
00:17:21.08 --> 00:17:22.08
I should have caught that.

365
00:17:22.08 --> 00:17:24.000
I made the video kind of thing kind of thing.

366
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.16
But man, it works.

367
00:17:25.16 --> 00:17:26.76
So like, it's real contagious.

368
00:17:26.76 --> 00:17:30.84
I think even people who are just naturally defensive, you know, you know, because people

369
00:17:30.84 --> 00:17:36.76
are different, you know, I think over time they tend to be, when they kind of build this,

370
00:17:36.76 --> 00:17:40.04
kind of, when everyone builds a reputation of not blaming, it's like they

371
00:17:40.04 --> 00:17:45.16
they, they let that natural guard down in these tent, look over time, you know, even if

372
00:17:45.16 --> 00:17:47.56
they at first, they don't want to.

373
00:17:47.56 --> 00:17:48.56
Jack.

374
00:17:48.56 --> 00:17:50.84
Next question.

375
00:17:50.84 --> 00:17:54.64
What are some ways to get out of a rut in jujitsu?

376
00:17:54.64 --> 00:17:57.40
We're just talking about this.

377
00:17:57.40 --> 00:17:58.40
It's all fair.

378
00:17:58.40 --> 00:18:03.36
I always get caught in the same spot, cross side and can't move.

379
00:18:03.36 --> 00:18:06.16
What should I do?

380
00:18:06.16 --> 00:18:08.84
This is a brutal answer.

381
00:18:08.84 --> 00:18:14.44
With the truth, if you have a hard time in a certain position, start there every time,

382
00:18:14.44 --> 00:18:19.24
start with a person across the side until you get used to it.

383
00:18:19.24 --> 00:18:24.24
And then on top of starting there and you start working your techniques, learn some new

384
00:18:24.24 --> 00:18:27.68
escapes, because whatever you're doing right now isn't working.

385
00:18:27.68 --> 00:18:29.56
So learn some new excuse, escapes.

386
00:18:29.56 --> 00:18:33.12
Now this doesn't mean that you need to learn 47 escapes.

387
00:18:33.12 --> 00:18:37.60
But if you've got your one go to escape and it's not working, there's actually there's

388
00:18:37.60 --> 00:18:40.20
a pretty good chance if you only know one escape from something that's not going to work.

389
00:18:40.20 --> 00:18:43.68
Because one escape, then the guests with the person has to defend, one thing.

390
00:18:43.68 --> 00:18:45.32
And so they stop it.

391
00:18:45.32 --> 00:18:52.16
So learn, you know, three escapes total, maybe four escapes total.

392
00:18:52.16 --> 00:18:56.84
And these are escapes that must be escapes that kind of chain together, which most of the

393
00:18:56.84 --> 00:18:58.24
time they do.

394
00:18:58.24 --> 00:19:02.84
So you learn, you know, you can ask, obviously, you can ask your instructor.

395
00:19:02.84 --> 00:19:05.52
You can ask some of the other students that you see get out.

396
00:19:05.52 --> 00:19:06.72
How did you do that?

397
00:19:06.72 --> 00:19:10.52
You can even go look at YouTube and Google cross side escapes and get some good ideas

398
00:19:10.52 --> 00:19:12.20
from there.

399
00:19:12.20 --> 00:19:16.56
And then you're going to have to take risks while you try your newest escapes in, you

400
00:19:16.56 --> 00:19:17.56
can drill them, of course.

401
00:19:17.56 --> 00:19:21.44
But then eventually you're going to have to try and live because when you do something

402
00:19:21.44 --> 00:19:24.000
in a drill, it is not the same as doing it live.

403
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.80
It's, there are adjustments that need to be made and things that you need to figure out.

404
00:19:28.80 --> 00:19:30.60
And you're not going to be successful.

405
00:19:30.60 --> 00:19:36.40
The first hundred times or fifty times or twenty eight times or four hundred and twenty

406
00:19:36.40 --> 00:19:38.60
times that you try something.

407
00:19:38.60 --> 00:19:41.88
There's a lot of little things you got to figure out and you're going to get caught in

408
00:19:41.88 --> 00:19:42.88
some of those times.

409
00:19:42.88 --> 00:19:44.88
You're going to try something you're going to get caught.

410
00:19:44.88 --> 00:19:51.04
So take risks and try your escapes.

411
00:19:51.04 --> 00:19:58.92
Another point, and I've probably talked about this before specifically, cross side.

412
00:19:58.92 --> 00:20:03.76
Don't wait until the person settles in before you start your escape.

413
00:20:03.76 --> 00:20:04.84
And this is true with anything, right?

414
00:20:04.84 --> 00:20:05.84
This is true with life.

415
00:20:05.84 --> 00:20:10.44
Don't wait until you're, if you see a bad position coming, don't wait until the position.

416
00:20:10.44 --> 00:20:13.64
Don't wait until the bad thing actually fully happens to you.

417
00:20:13.64 --> 00:20:16.60
No, start to defend it before it settles in on you.

418
00:20:16.60 --> 00:20:18.84
Get a bad scenario coming down the line.

419
00:20:18.84 --> 00:20:21.84
Start to aggressively counter that bad thing.

420
00:20:21.84 --> 00:20:28.28
Whatever it is before it actually gets you.

421
00:20:28.28 --> 00:20:35.12
And if you can do that, then you will be, I guarantee that's a lot of the problem right

422
00:20:35.12 --> 00:20:36.12
there.

423
00:20:36.12 --> 00:20:38.40
Because, you know what?

424
00:20:38.40 --> 00:20:40.36
Because getting out of a cross side is a really hard position.

425
00:20:40.36 --> 00:20:41.36
You get out of, I don't care who you are.

426
00:20:41.36 --> 00:20:42.36
I've a hard time.

427
00:20:42.36 --> 00:20:45.92
When Dean gets a cross side on me, it is hard to get out.

428
00:20:45.92 --> 00:20:49.96
Like I mean, it's really hard to get out.

429
00:20:49.96 --> 00:20:50.96
So what does that mean?

430
00:20:50.96 --> 00:20:53.72
Yeah, that's a dominant position.

431
00:20:53.72 --> 00:20:58.08
And that's the last thing is like you have to take some risks to get out.

432
00:20:58.08 --> 00:21:00.20
Sometimes you got to break the rules to get out.

433
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:01.40
You got to do something.

434
00:21:01.40 --> 00:21:06.28
You got to offer up a possible submission to them that you know is coming.

435
00:21:06.28 --> 00:21:09.28
There's some things that you can do like that.

436
00:21:09.28 --> 00:21:17.32
But escaping before the situation has occurred to you is a very positive thing.

437
00:21:17.32 --> 00:21:18.32
You could do that with anything.

438
00:21:18.32 --> 00:21:23.28
You're in a relationship, you see something bad coming down the easy, a human being, you're

439
00:21:23.28 --> 00:21:27.84
in a relationship with, and you see that the relationship is going in a bad direction.

440
00:21:27.84 --> 00:21:36.24
If you try and either fix it or end it before the thing goes sideways, that's the smart thing

441
00:21:36.24 --> 00:21:37.24
to do.

442
00:21:37.24 --> 00:21:40.24
Don't wait until everything's a disaster.

443
00:21:40.24 --> 00:21:43.40
You've got to go and get the restraining order.

444
00:21:43.40 --> 00:21:44.40
Whatever.

445
00:21:44.40 --> 00:21:49.12
You're calling the cops because you've got someone that's acting irrational.

446
00:21:49.12 --> 00:21:52.52
Don't wait until that moment.

447
00:21:52.52 --> 00:21:54.52
Solve the problem as early as possible.

448
00:21:54.52 --> 00:21:55.52
Is the point.

449
00:21:55.52 --> 00:21:56.52
Yeah.

450
00:21:56.52 --> 00:21:58.52
So that's how you get out of that little rut.

451
00:21:58.52 --> 00:22:03.64
Yeah, that's what you said in the beginning of the start in that bad situation.

452
00:22:03.64 --> 00:22:05.04
That's a huge hug.

453
00:22:05.04 --> 00:22:08.84
And I don't know if all the academy's do this, but I mean, Dean has always done this

454
00:22:08.84 --> 00:22:11.72
where before you do open matter, the life rolling, whatever.

455
00:22:11.72 --> 00:22:16.12
Right before that, there's a part where it's essentially situational training.

456
00:22:16.12 --> 00:22:17.64
You know, you start side control.

457
00:22:17.64 --> 00:22:21.08
We're going to go for two minutes or minute half whatever, one night top one and bottom

458
00:22:21.08 --> 00:22:22.08
obviously.

459
00:22:22.08 --> 00:22:23.08
And if you get out restarted.

460
00:22:23.08 --> 00:22:24.08
Exactly right.

461
00:22:24.08 --> 00:22:26.84
Yeah, you know, the top guys trying to submit the bottom guy, the bottom guy is trying

462
00:22:26.84 --> 00:22:27.84
to escape.

463
00:22:27.84 --> 00:22:29.84
If the bottom guy escapes, you start over.

464
00:22:29.84 --> 00:22:30.84
Yeah.

465
00:22:30.84 --> 00:22:31.84
That's it.

466
00:22:31.84 --> 00:22:33.24
And the other point to that is if you get submitted doesn't count.

467
00:22:33.24 --> 00:22:34.24
Exactly right.

468
00:22:34.24 --> 00:22:35.24
Like it's like, yeah, of course.

469
00:22:35.24 --> 00:22:36.24
I'm trying new things.

470
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:37.24
I'm taking rest.

471
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:38.24
So I expect you.

472
00:22:38.24 --> 00:22:41.60
I actually expect that you're going to get submitted because you're

473
00:22:41.60 --> 00:22:42.44
trying new things.

474
00:22:42.44 --> 00:22:46.48
If you, in fact, if you don't get submitted, you fail because you didn't try

475
00:22:46.48 --> 00:22:48.92
something new that was really, yeah, you're just staying there.

476
00:22:48.92 --> 00:22:51.000
Yeah, that's not what that drills for.

477
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And you can feel it, too.

478
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.48
You know, like, okay, sure the guy tapped me, yeah, you don't want him to

479
00:22:54.48 --> 00:22:56.28
tap you up, but you're there at escape.

480
00:22:56.28 --> 00:22:57.28
That's it.

481
00:22:57.28 --> 00:23:01.84
You know, so it's not about like winning this match or losing this round or whatever,

482
00:23:01.84 --> 00:23:05.56
you know, you're, and then you get so familiar with being inside control.

483
00:23:05.56 --> 00:23:08.32
So when you do go live, you're like, oh, I'm familiar because I've done this situation

484
00:23:08.32 --> 00:23:09.32
for drill.

485
00:23:09.32 --> 00:23:11.56
Full speed, by the way, it's a full speed drill.

486
00:23:11.56 --> 00:23:13.72
And yeah, you're just so familiar with that position.

487
00:23:13.72 --> 00:23:17.72
So not only more comfortable, you know those different escapes that you've learned,

488
00:23:17.72 --> 00:23:20.08
you don't really have that day or whatever, whenever you learn them.

489
00:23:20.08 --> 00:23:22.44
And then you can execute way better.

490
00:23:22.44 --> 00:23:24.12
You can comfortable being uncomfortable.

491
00:23:24.12 --> 00:23:32.88
Yeah, but that help, and that helps so much those, those situational sparring drills.

492
00:23:32.88 --> 00:23:33.88
Next question.

493
00:23:33.88 --> 00:23:34.88
Juggle.

494
00:23:34.88 --> 00:23:38.52
There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

495
00:23:38.52 --> 00:23:41.60
Do you think there are exceptions to this?

496
00:23:41.60 --> 00:23:47.000
If so, how do you know your part of the exception?

497
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.84
That is a quote from the book Extreme Ownership written by myself on my brother,

498
00:23:51.84 --> 00:23:58.08
Lave Babin and it is a quote that I don't want to say we stole, but we stole.

499
00:23:58.08 --> 00:24:05.16
We appropriated from David Hackworth, who said, there's no bad, I think he said no bad

500
00:24:05.16 --> 00:24:11.000
officers, no bad units, only bad officers, and Napoleon, who said there's no bad regiments,

501
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.68
only bad kernels.

502
00:24:12.68 --> 00:24:16.12
And we said there's no bad teams, only bad leaders.

503
00:24:16.12 --> 00:24:19.72
And the question is, is there an exception to this?

504
00:24:19.72 --> 00:24:21.08
And how do you know if you're part of the exception?

505
00:24:21.08 --> 00:24:25.48
Well, actually there is, there's a big exception to this.

506
00:24:25.48 --> 00:24:30.84
And the exception is that there are bad leaders with good teams.

507
00:24:30.84 --> 00:24:31.84
That is true.

508
00:24:31.84 --> 00:24:32.84
That can happen.

509
00:24:32.84 --> 00:24:37.04
Sometimes you get a bad leader that is running a really, really good team.

510
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:38.08
So that's an exception.

511
00:24:38.08 --> 00:24:39.52
I guess it's an exception this world.

512
00:24:39.52 --> 00:24:42.08
Maybe that's the way I took it.

513
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:47.76
So you get a team that's so good that they just continue to perform even though they have

514
00:24:47.76 --> 00:24:48.60
a horrible leader.

515
00:24:48.60 --> 00:24:52.36
They perform despite their bad leader.

516
00:24:52.36 --> 00:24:53.36
Gotcha.

517
00:24:53.36 --> 00:24:59.68
Now, what this doesn't, this does not prove, you know, I always say leadership is the most

518
00:24:59.68 --> 00:25:01.16
important thing on the battlefield.

519
00:25:01.16 --> 00:25:05.000
This doesn't disprove that statement.

520
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.48
You'd think maybe it does because, oh, you got a bad leader and you got a good team, then

521
00:25:08.48 --> 00:25:10.000
maybe leadership isn't that important.

522
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
That's wrong.

523
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Actually, what it proves is that leadership can come from any level inside the organization.

524
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
That's what it proves.

525
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.72
And it proves that because I've seen that over and over again when I was running the training

526
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:27.64
from the sea of pollutants, eventually I didn't care where the leadership in the

527
00:25:27.64 --> 00:25:35.68
Platoon was because I realized that it was a real, it was a real, hard thing to hope for

528
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:42.12
that you had the person that was in the leadership positions, like the Platoon commander or

529
00:25:42.12 --> 00:25:49.16
the Platoon chief to assume or to figure that they were going to be the leader that you

530
00:25:49.16 --> 00:25:52.24
wanted them to be was a big assumption to make.

531
00:25:52.24 --> 00:25:55.80
And so what I realized after training for a while is that even though I wanted the leaders

532
00:25:55.80 --> 00:26:00.68
to be those senior guys who were supposed to be taking leadership, eventually I realized

533
00:26:00.68 --> 00:26:03.40
as I didn't care where that leadership came from.

534
00:26:03.40 --> 00:26:07.64
As long as there were a couple of good leaders, you'd end up with a good C-Oplatoon and

535
00:26:07.64 --> 00:26:10.68
the Platoon would be on track.

536
00:26:10.68 --> 00:26:15.16
Now maybe the question is what this person is hinting at.

537
00:26:15.16 --> 00:26:20.56
The exception being is there an exception that if there is a bad team, maybe that team

538
00:26:20.56 --> 00:26:24.16
is just so filled with bad people that they can't get the job done.

539
00:26:24.16 --> 00:26:25.80
That's the kind of exception he's talking about.

540
00:26:25.80 --> 00:26:30.40
Or failing because the team is so bad, even though the leader is good, even though the

541
00:26:30.40 --> 00:26:35.40
leader is good, but the team is so bad that that's an exception to the rule.

542
00:26:35.40 --> 00:26:39.32
Well guess what?

543
00:26:39.32 --> 00:26:42.44
Who's responsible for the people on the team?

544
00:26:42.44 --> 00:26:45.76
Who's responsible for training the people on the team so that they can get good at their

545
00:26:45.76 --> 00:26:52.16
job and they can perform with excellence or who's in charge of getting rid of the people

546
00:26:52.16 --> 00:26:55.72
that are so far so that the team steps up their performance.

547
00:26:55.72 --> 00:26:59.000
Well, the answer to all those questions is the leader.

548
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.04
So if you're on a bad team and you're leading the team, it's your fault.

549
00:27:04.04 --> 00:27:06.48
And there's no exception to that.

550
00:27:06.48 --> 00:27:07.48
Zero.

551
00:27:07.48 --> 00:27:11.96
Yeah, I'm over here trying to think of the exception, but just what you said is like,

552
00:27:11.96 --> 00:27:13.92
yeah, it kind of negates any.

553
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:19.76
Hey, let's take a real, real simple example of like a sports team, right?

554
00:27:19.76 --> 00:27:24.72
Oh, this sports team got dealt a bad hand and now the people on the team, well, what

555
00:27:24.72 --> 00:27:26.04
are you going to do?

556
00:27:26.04 --> 00:27:27.04
You're going to train those people.

557
00:27:27.04 --> 00:27:28.04
Who's responsible?

558
00:27:28.04 --> 00:27:31.40
I'm not saying you're going to perform right now, but you can get on the trajectory

559
00:27:31.40 --> 00:27:34.32
will you be good eventually?

560
00:27:34.32 --> 00:27:35.80
Now if you just blame, hey, I got a bad team.

561
00:27:35.80 --> 00:27:36.80
Well, guess what?

562
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:37.80
Then you don't put an effort.

563
00:27:37.80 --> 00:27:38.80
Guess what?

564
00:27:38.80 --> 00:27:39.80
You're going to continue to be a loser.

565
00:27:39.80 --> 00:27:40.80
The exception.

566
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:44.80
Yeah, my team and my team is just so bad.

567
00:27:44.80 --> 00:27:45.80
Train your people.

568
00:27:45.80 --> 00:27:47.80
I'm not saying you're a miracle worker.

569
00:27:47.80 --> 00:27:48.80
Yeah.

570
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:53.80
I'm not saying you can, you can take people that don't have any skills and instantly

571
00:27:53.80 --> 00:27:57.84
through your leadership term them into incredible performers.

572
00:27:57.84 --> 00:28:00.08
No, that's not going to happen, but guess what?

573
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:02.76
As a leader, you've got to bring people into your team that are good.

574
00:28:02.76 --> 00:28:06.36
You do train the people that you do have up to the best of their abilities and the people

575
00:28:06.36 --> 00:28:08.24
that can't perform the way they need to perform.

576
00:28:08.24 --> 00:28:09.24
You get rid of them.

577
00:28:09.24 --> 00:28:10.24
Yeah.

578
00:28:10.24 --> 00:28:12.52
That's it.

579
00:28:12.52 --> 00:28:15.16
No real exceptions.

580
00:28:15.16 --> 00:28:18.24
Other than, yeah, you can have a good team with bad leaders.

581
00:28:18.24 --> 00:28:21.36
Yeah, I only guess it's a good leader somewhere in there.

582
00:28:21.36 --> 00:28:25.56
The exceptions thing, I think it's healthy in my opinion.

583
00:28:25.56 --> 00:28:31.96
No, it's good for this and most of the things where if I or we start thinking that

584
00:28:31.96 --> 00:28:36.72
we're the exception, so we don't have to put in like, I don't know, like the work or

585
00:28:36.72 --> 00:28:40.84
whatever, not necessarily work, but the, you know, like, okay, we'll take this.

586
00:28:40.84 --> 00:28:42.56
No bad teams, don't leave bad leaders.

587
00:28:42.56 --> 00:28:46.64
But, you know, if I say, I might be the exception to this because my team is so bad.

588
00:28:46.64 --> 00:28:49.84
It's kind of like, you're going to do a little cop out there.

589
00:28:49.84 --> 00:28:50.84
Kind of thing.

590
00:28:50.84 --> 00:28:51.84
100% of it.

591
00:28:51.84 --> 00:28:56.88
If you don't take ownership of what's going on, then you're not going to perform well.

592
00:28:56.88 --> 00:29:01.44
If you just blame your genetics, then that means, okay, well, I'm not going to get any kind

593
00:29:01.44 --> 00:29:02.44
of shape whatsoever.

594
00:29:02.44 --> 00:29:05.12
Then guess what, guess what, kind of shape your being.

595
00:29:05.12 --> 00:29:06.12
Junk.

596
00:29:06.12 --> 00:29:07.12
Substant.

597
00:29:07.12 --> 00:29:08.12
Substandard.

598
00:29:08.12 --> 00:29:09.12
Thanks, Wes.

599
00:29:09.12 --> 00:29:10.12
Junk.

600
00:29:10.12 --> 00:29:16.56
Leadership is knowing when to cut someone loose, that can't

601
00:29:16.56 --> 00:29:18.08
perform in a team.

602
00:29:18.08 --> 00:29:24.32
But, do you have any techniques for trying to help people who lack common sense get better

603
00:29:24.32 --> 00:29:27.12
in the name of just trying to make the world a better place?

604
00:29:27.12 --> 00:29:30.12
Obviously without being a jerk.

605
00:29:30.12 --> 00:29:35.36
My, my common answer in situations like this and you've heard it before is to pick, put them

606
00:29:35.36 --> 00:29:36.60
in charge or something, right?

607
00:29:36.60 --> 00:29:40.40
You got someone that's, that doesn't have a lot of common sense.

608
00:29:40.40 --> 00:29:44.88
Pick something that's maybe just outside their level of competency and put them in charge

609
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:45.88
of it.

610
00:29:45.88 --> 00:29:50.32
So, something that doesn't put too much at risk.

611
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:52.68
So, you can give them some room to make some decisions.

612
00:29:52.68 --> 00:29:55.96
And some mistakes without doing too much damage.

613
00:29:55.96 --> 00:30:03.76
And then you coach them, you monitor them and you coach them.

614
00:30:03.76 --> 00:30:12.44
And you coach them not just on what decision to make, but more important how to make that

615
00:30:12.44 --> 00:30:13.44
decision.

616
00:30:13.44 --> 00:30:18.48
If you think about what common sense is, if you break it down, if you break down what

617
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:22.60
common sense is, common sense is like a blanket term that we don't really relate it to

618
00:30:22.60 --> 00:30:24.96
what it really means.

619
00:30:24.96 --> 00:30:32.08
But it's a blanket term that covers a person's sort of natural ability to make good decisions.

620
00:30:32.08 --> 00:30:35.68
That's what common sense essentially is, right?

621
00:30:35.68 --> 00:30:38.16
Because you don't look at someone, someone makes a bad decision.

622
00:30:38.16 --> 00:30:40.44
And you say that person has no common sense.

623
00:30:40.44 --> 00:30:42.80
Someone makes a good decision or continually makes good decisions.

624
00:30:42.80 --> 00:30:45.88
You go, the person's got a lot of common sense.

625
00:30:45.88 --> 00:30:51.68
So what we're really talking about is there ability to make decisions.

626
00:30:51.68 --> 00:30:56.64
So when you're trying to help someone increase their common sense, what you're really trying

627
00:30:56.64 --> 00:30:59.68
to do is improve their decision making process.

628
00:30:59.68 --> 00:31:04.52
So some things to look at when it comes to improving your decision making process, number

629
00:31:04.52 --> 00:31:07.80
one learn how to step back and detach.

630
00:31:07.80 --> 00:31:09.20
That's number one.

631
00:31:09.20 --> 00:31:15.44
You can't make good decisions when you're all embroiled in the gunfight.

632
00:31:15.44 --> 00:31:23.28
Learn how to analyze and assess and create different courses of action.

633
00:31:23.28 --> 00:31:25.76
Some people only see you one way.

634
00:31:25.76 --> 00:31:29.44
And when you only see one way and you can't detach, you never open up your mind to see

635
00:31:29.44 --> 00:31:33.04
that there could possibly be other ways.

636
00:31:33.04 --> 00:31:38.56
You have to, in order to have good common sense, slash, make good decisions.

637
00:31:38.56 --> 00:31:48.40
You have to understand how to look at and understand what the consequences of your actions

638
00:31:48.40 --> 00:31:50.12
are going to be.

639
00:31:50.12 --> 00:31:52.68
And that includes second and third order effects.

640
00:31:52.68 --> 00:31:55.24
Because a lot of times when people, you know, that guy has no common sense because they

641
00:31:55.24 --> 00:31:57.40
do something that to them makes sense at that moment.

642
00:31:57.40 --> 00:31:58.92
They don't understand what the consequences are.

643
00:31:58.92 --> 00:32:01.04
They don't understand the second or third order effects.

644
00:32:01.04 --> 00:32:02.80
And so it ends up being a bad decision.

645
00:32:02.80 --> 00:32:07.68
And we just throw up like, oh, the guy got no common sense.

646
00:32:07.68 --> 00:32:11.24
To make a good decision, you have to know how to mitigate risk.

647
00:32:11.24 --> 00:32:13.72
That's also very important to make a good decision.

648
00:32:13.72 --> 00:32:18.40
You have to understand what your assets are and what kind of resources you have.

649
00:32:18.40 --> 00:32:21.68
Even on a simple decision.

650
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:27.52
Even on a quote common sense decision, you have to understand what you have at hand to help

651
00:32:27.52 --> 00:32:30.44
you execute whatever decision you make.

652
00:32:30.44 --> 00:32:31.96
You have to, this is a big one.

653
00:32:31.96 --> 00:32:35.08
You have to learn if you want to make good decisions.

654
00:32:35.08 --> 00:32:40.24
You have to understand that you're going to make some assumptions.

655
00:32:40.24 --> 00:32:45.44
And you have to analyze those assumptions and see which ones make sense to make and which

656
00:32:45.44 --> 00:32:48.76
ones are not sensible to make.

657
00:32:48.76 --> 00:32:53.40
Because obviously, and there's that old, there's that old saying about assumptions don't

658
00:32:53.40 --> 00:32:55.84
assume because it makes an ass out of you and me.

659
00:32:55.84 --> 00:32:58.20
That's a pretty realistic saying.

660
00:32:58.20 --> 00:33:00.88
It's a pretty good saying to keep in the back of your mind.

661
00:33:00.88 --> 00:33:06.20
If you make assumptions on things, however, that being said, if you make no assumptions

662
00:33:06.20 --> 00:33:09.72
well, then you can never move forward on most things because you've got to assume like,

663
00:33:09.72 --> 00:33:12.48
okay, most of the time this is probably what's going to happen and you can go forward

664
00:33:12.48 --> 00:33:13.76
with that.

665
00:33:13.76 --> 00:33:23.04
So the list goes on and on and what you need to do is as you give these people a little

666
00:33:23.04 --> 00:33:29.04
bit of room and a little bit of responsibility and a little bit of decision making in

667
00:33:29.04 --> 00:33:30.04
their life.

668
00:33:30.04 --> 00:33:31.40
With your kids, right?

669
00:33:31.40 --> 00:33:34.48
You give your kids the opportunity to make a decision.

670
00:33:34.48 --> 00:33:41.56
And if they make a bad decision and all you do is smack them without explaining to them

671
00:33:41.56 --> 00:33:47.24
the process, the decision making process, which is where that decision came from, then

672
00:33:47.24 --> 00:33:50.64
they're never going to gain more common sense.

673
00:33:50.64 --> 00:33:54.36
And you know, when you think about the list, I think detachment is actually the most

674
00:33:54.36 --> 00:33:56.16
important thing.

675
00:33:56.16 --> 00:34:02.36
And I think what happens, the people that don't have common sense, they actually don't

676
00:34:02.36 --> 00:34:07.88
have the ability at that time because they haven't been trained properly to see things

677
00:34:07.88 --> 00:34:09.28
from an outside perspective.

678
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:10.28
Yeah.

679
00:34:10.28 --> 00:34:15.56
Have you ever noticed when somebody does something that's completely lack of common sense,

680
00:34:15.56 --> 00:34:21.44
when you raise the point to them, they're always kind of like a staunched that they don't

681
00:34:21.44 --> 00:34:26.12
even get why what they did was dumb.

682
00:34:26.12 --> 00:34:30.04
They just think that that's just how it was going to be.

683
00:34:30.04 --> 00:34:32.64
And they don't even understand that what they did was dumb.

684
00:34:32.64 --> 00:34:37.32
And sometimes you have to actually explain to people that they're so embedded in their

685
00:34:37.32 --> 00:34:40.52
decision-making process, they can't see it from an external perspective.

686
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:44.28
So they don't even understand how dumb their decision was.

687
00:34:44.28 --> 00:34:50.88
If you can get them some level of detachment, then you're moving them in the right direction.

688
00:34:50.88 --> 00:34:52.32
You're improving their common sense.

689
00:34:52.32 --> 00:34:57.36
And yes, when you're doing that to your credit, you're actually making the world a better

690
00:34:57.36 --> 00:34:59.36
place.

691
00:34:59.36 --> 00:35:00.36
Yeah.

692
00:35:00.36 --> 00:35:04.92
And they get, and you kind of said this anyway, but you give them experience, like when

693
00:35:04.92 --> 00:35:08.56
you let them make for your decision to get, because really that's really what common

694
00:35:08.56 --> 00:35:12.40
sense is, right, if you have or don't have common sense, it's like, if you have a lot of

695
00:35:12.40 --> 00:35:16.68
experience, common sense is like, you're a little bit more in touch with it than someone

696
00:35:16.68 --> 00:35:17.68
with very little experience.

697
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:20.24
So let's say, I mean, it's culturally, we'll say.

698
00:35:20.24 --> 00:35:22.72
So in Hawaii, everyone takes out their shoes when they go in the house.

699
00:35:22.72 --> 00:35:24.20
This is just how.

700
00:35:24.20 --> 00:35:26.64
And in the mainland, it's not like that.

701
00:35:26.64 --> 00:35:31.88
So if I've never been a Hawaii, I've no experience in Hawaii, but in the, I live in the

702
00:35:31.88 --> 00:35:32.88
mainland the whole time.

703
00:35:32.88 --> 00:35:35.76
But I don't have any access to the whole Hawaii culture, whatever.

704
00:35:35.76 --> 00:35:36.76
I've got a Hawaii.

705
00:35:36.76 --> 00:35:38.68
I'm going to leave my shoes on.

706
00:35:38.68 --> 00:35:40.48
It's like common sense, man.

707
00:35:40.48 --> 00:35:44.56
You take off your shoes if you've only lived in Hawaii the whole time, right?

708
00:35:44.56 --> 00:35:45.56
No.

709
00:35:45.56 --> 00:35:51.76
It's you could argue, hey, all you got to do is look around and see, but I don't, I'm

710
00:35:51.76 --> 00:35:54.96
not trained to look around to see what everyone's wearing and not wearing.

711
00:35:54.96 --> 00:35:56.36
You know, like, well, I'm weird.

712
00:35:56.36 --> 00:36:01.72
You ever notice, I would say once a month at the gym, someone walks on the mat with

713
00:36:01.72 --> 00:36:08.96
shoes on, like, just not even when it's, they're really stepping over a big pile or

714
00:36:08.96 --> 00:36:12.48
line of shoes of flip flops, it's just to get on the mat.

715
00:36:12.48 --> 00:36:13.48
And there's no factor.

716
00:36:13.48 --> 00:36:15.52
They're stepping over with their street shoes on.

717
00:36:15.52 --> 00:36:16.52
Yeah, exactly.

718
00:36:16.52 --> 00:36:21.28
That's the exact, the exact, the exact, the common sense would tell you, hey, it looks

719
00:36:21.28 --> 00:36:22.52
like every single person.

720
00:36:22.52 --> 00:36:26.20
There's 28 people on the mat, none of them are wearing shoes and I'm stepping over.

721
00:36:26.20 --> 00:36:28.80
You think, but that's a person that does an F common sense.

722
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:29.80
Right.

723
00:36:29.80 --> 00:36:32.44
So what you have to do with a person like that, when you see someone that does that kind

724
00:36:32.44 --> 00:36:34.76
of thing, you know, let's say your kid did that.

725
00:36:34.76 --> 00:36:37.16
You'd say, hey, instead of just going, hey, kick off your shoes.

726
00:36:37.16 --> 00:36:41.72
You know, you go, hey, before you do something, look around at the environment.

727
00:36:41.72 --> 00:36:42.72
Take a look around.

728
00:36:42.72 --> 00:36:43.72
What do you see?

729
00:36:43.72 --> 00:36:46.48
All these people on the mat, none of them wearing shoes.

730
00:36:46.48 --> 00:36:50.48
And you look right in front of your feet and there's all these shoes off the mat, that

731
00:36:50.48 --> 00:36:53.96
probably indicates that you should take off your shoes.

732
00:36:53.96 --> 00:36:55.24
That should be a good decision.

733
00:36:55.24 --> 00:36:59.64
It should be, but now you're going to get another different type of experience.

734
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:04.72
Like if you're in scenarios often where you were looking around and seeing what other

735
00:37:04.72 --> 00:37:09.84
people are doing and wearing, like, and all this stuff, if you're in constantly in situations

736
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:12.72
like that, that will become more part of your common sense.

737
00:37:12.72 --> 00:37:13.56
Right.

738
00:37:13.56 --> 00:37:19.04
So it's like to say, I mean, there are plenty of people who in normal everyday life have

739
00:37:19.04 --> 00:37:23.28
normal common sense, like everyone else, who would wear shoes on the mat.

740
00:37:23.28 --> 00:37:27.04
They just simply would because they don't, hey, these guys are training.

741
00:37:27.04 --> 00:37:29.08
They're not going to wear shoes while they're training.

742
00:37:29.08 --> 00:37:30.08
So they took off the shoes.

743
00:37:30.08 --> 00:37:31.08
I'm not training.

744
00:37:31.08 --> 00:37:32.28
I'm just going to go talk to this guy over here.

745
00:37:32.28 --> 00:37:34.24
Oh, my, I'm rolling with the shoes on the mat.

746
00:37:34.24 --> 00:37:35.48
Just like, oh, I've never been on.

747
00:37:35.48 --> 00:37:37.08
You know, I'm going to go in this house.

748
00:37:37.08 --> 00:37:38.08
They live here.

749
00:37:38.08 --> 00:37:41.64
They maybe he just got out of bed, maybe they just want to be comfortable because they got out

750
00:37:41.64 --> 00:37:42.64
of work.

751
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:45.84
Well, I don't, it doesn't go through the thought process of my common sense.

752
00:37:45.84 --> 00:37:50.64
My common sense is if I don't have to take off my shoes for something specific, I'm not

753
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:51.64
going to do it.

754
00:37:51.64 --> 00:37:54.08
That's just how that's just my common experience.

755
00:37:54.08 --> 00:37:57.20
You know, so the common sense is kind of a situational thing.

756
00:37:57.20 --> 00:37:58.92
You know, it's not just couldn't drive.

757
00:37:58.92 --> 00:38:00.64
He has common sense versus not.

758
00:38:00.64 --> 00:38:04.80
So you put them in more experience that's common to the group.

759
00:38:04.80 --> 00:38:07.60
Oh, man, it's common sense goes up.

760
00:38:07.60 --> 00:38:08.60
Fair enough.

761
00:38:08.60 --> 00:38:09.60
I think so.

762
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:11.60
I think so.

763
00:38:11.60 --> 00:38:12.60
Next question.

764
00:38:12.60 --> 00:38:17.84
I've been told by employees that I'm cold and non-engaging.

765
00:38:17.84 --> 00:38:23.04
My peers say I charge hell with a bucket of water and sometimes get to stop or sometimes

766
00:38:23.04 --> 00:38:26.68
forget to stop and feel the bucket in military training.

767
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:32.52
We all went through the mental part and in battle, someone engaged properly.

768
00:38:32.52 --> 00:38:35.72
I treat my business the same way as I fought.

769
00:38:35.72 --> 00:38:40.60
In a firefight, my mind was clear, focused on the objective, and being aggressive always.

770
00:38:40.60 --> 00:38:43.000
Why should my business be any different?

771
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.92
Delegate and don't quit until you accomplish the goal.

772
00:38:46.92 --> 00:38:51.40
Isn't this wrong?

773
00:38:51.40 --> 00:38:57.16
So let's start with cold and non-engaging.

774
00:38:57.16 --> 00:39:01.28
I get that people have different levels of emotional responsiveness.

775
00:39:01.28 --> 00:39:02.28
I get that.

776
00:39:02.28 --> 00:39:08.48
I'm probably a little bit on the low end of that in terms of being super emotionally

777
00:39:08.48 --> 00:39:11.36
responsive.

778
00:39:11.36 --> 00:39:14.12
I don't really get mad.

779
00:39:14.12 --> 00:39:19.44
I don't usually get frustrated.

780
00:39:19.44 --> 00:39:23.76
But at the same time, as a leader, you have to show some emotion.

781
00:39:23.76 --> 00:39:28.08
And if you show no emotion at all, then you're on a person, you're a robot.

782
00:39:28.08 --> 00:39:31.84
And robots don't really connect with people.

783
00:39:31.84 --> 00:39:39.28
And so you don't form a new relationships, and if you don't form good relationships,

784
00:39:39.28 --> 00:39:45.92
you're not going to have a good leadership connection with your team.

785
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:46.92
That's the way it is.

786
00:39:46.92 --> 00:39:49.32
So you've got to show some emotions.

787
00:39:49.32 --> 00:39:52.28
You don't need to get all wild.

788
00:39:52.28 --> 00:39:56.36
And in fact, as a leader, your emotions should be controlled.

789
00:39:56.36 --> 00:40:03.08
If a normal person's emotions go from one to ten, a leader should be like, you know,

790
00:40:03.08 --> 00:40:06.56
at three, maybe four, and they shouldn't go beyond that.

791
00:40:06.56 --> 00:40:07.96
And I've talked about this before.

792
00:40:07.96 --> 00:40:13.24
If my team's getting all emotional and I'm just all cold, I actually disconnect from

793
00:40:13.24 --> 00:40:14.24
my team.

794
00:40:14.24 --> 00:40:16.60
And obviously they're looking at me like, I'm not one of them.

795
00:40:16.60 --> 00:40:17.60
That's a bad thing.

796
00:40:17.60 --> 00:40:19.28
Yeah, it doesn't even care.

797
00:40:19.28 --> 00:40:20.68
Same thing with your spouse.

798
00:40:20.68 --> 00:40:25.60
If you're spouse is all mad about something and you're like, hey, just calm down.

799
00:40:25.60 --> 00:40:27.16
Look at that's going to be a problem.

800
00:40:27.16 --> 00:40:30.48
You have to give them some emotions back.

801
00:40:30.48 --> 00:40:34.76
So show some emotions as a leader.

802
00:40:34.76 --> 00:40:41.16
You might even have to, you know, many factions are just a little bit to let them see

803
00:40:41.16 --> 00:40:42.16
that you care.

804
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:45.68
You know, you got to do that with your kids sometimes, you know, because like, your

805
00:40:45.68 --> 00:40:49.56
kid is doing something that you know they shouldn't be doing, but it's kind of funny.

806
00:40:49.56 --> 00:40:50.68
And it's hard to get mad at.

807
00:40:50.68 --> 00:40:55.40
But you realize if you don't get mad and this behavior escalates, then that's

808
00:40:55.40 --> 00:40:56.40
problematic.

809
00:40:56.40 --> 00:41:00.04
Like, are you kind of fired up when your kid does something kinds up on a wall and

810
00:41:00.04 --> 00:41:02.44
is balancing, you know, eight feet in the air?

811
00:41:02.44 --> 00:41:04.76
Well, if they fall and crack their head, that's going to be a problem.

812
00:41:04.76 --> 00:41:07.000
At the same time, you think it's kind of cool.

813
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.64
But you have to reinforce safety.

814
00:41:11.64 --> 00:41:14.88
And so you've got to be like a little bit angry at him.

815
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:15.88
Right?

816
00:41:15.88 --> 00:41:17.32
Hey, hey, I told you not to do it.

817
00:41:17.32 --> 00:41:18.32
Right?

818
00:41:18.32 --> 00:41:20.80
Kid running in the row or whatever, you've got to reinforce stuff.

819
00:41:20.80 --> 00:41:25.76
So it's a, you, you actually have to show some level of emotions.

820
00:41:25.76 --> 00:41:34.52
Now, as far as the other part of the question is aggression and never quitting, is that

821
00:41:34.52 --> 00:41:35.52
wrong?

822
00:41:35.52 --> 00:41:40.72
Well, you know, quite frankly, yes.

823
00:41:40.72 --> 00:41:46.44
Yes, it can be very wrong.

824
00:41:46.44 --> 00:41:52.04
Of course, much of what the statement is, it makes sense.

825
00:41:52.04 --> 00:41:53.04
Right?

826
00:41:53.04 --> 00:41:54.04
Be aggressive.

827
00:41:54.04 --> 00:41:55.04
Don't quit.

828
00:41:55.04 --> 00:41:56.04
Focus on the objective.

829
00:41:56.04 --> 00:41:57.04
Charge into hell with vengeance.

830
00:41:57.04 --> 00:41:58.04
Right?

831
00:41:58.04 --> 00:41:59.04
We all like to hear that.

832
00:41:59.04 --> 00:42:00.04
Right?

833
00:42:00.04 --> 00:42:01.64
That reflects a great attitude.

834
00:42:01.64 --> 00:42:06.24
I think everyone would expect me and they would actually hear me say those things.

835
00:42:06.24 --> 00:42:08.92
The same exact things I want to be aggressive were never going to quit.

836
00:42:08.92 --> 00:42:10.68
We're going to take that objective no matter what.

837
00:42:10.68 --> 00:42:15.08
You would care me say that.

838
00:42:15.08 --> 00:42:19.20
But at the same time, we have to remember that there are dichotomies in leadership.

839
00:42:19.20 --> 00:42:20.44
Right?

840
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:26.52
And taking what is a normally, what is normally a good attitude to an absolute extreme without

841
00:42:26.52 --> 00:42:31.88
any balance at all, that will turn into a problem.

842
00:42:31.88 --> 00:42:36.60
So it sounds like this individual is aggressive, which is a very positive trait.

843
00:42:36.60 --> 00:42:41.84
But it sounds like perhaps there are times when this individual might be too aggressive.

844
00:42:41.84 --> 00:42:45.16
Now most people don't want to hear that.

845
00:42:45.16 --> 00:42:47.56
Then they don't think they're going to hear that for me.

846
00:42:47.56 --> 00:42:51.12
You almost think when somebody asks me a question like this, you almost think in their

847
00:42:51.12 --> 00:42:54.52
back of their mind they're going, you know what, Jock was going to tell me and I'm going

848
00:42:54.52 --> 00:42:56.08
to go even harder.

849
00:42:56.08 --> 00:42:57.08
Right?

850
00:42:57.08 --> 00:43:01.92
Should be very unfortunate from Jocko about how being aggressive is awesome.

851
00:43:01.92 --> 00:43:03.56
But here's the reality.

852
00:43:03.56 --> 00:43:06.48
And especially if you throw like the firefight thing, like Jocko's definitely going to

853
00:43:06.48 --> 00:43:08.40
be on board with me now.

854
00:43:08.40 --> 00:43:09.40
But guess what?

855
00:43:09.40 --> 00:43:14.12
If you're in a firefight and the enemy isn't an elevated bunker to position across

856
00:43:14.12 --> 00:43:21.60
open ground and you just keep attacking it with your platoon, what's going to happen?

857
00:43:21.60 --> 00:43:22.68
I'll tell you what's going to happen.

858
00:43:22.68 --> 00:43:24.40
You're all going to die.

859
00:43:24.40 --> 00:43:26.72
That's what's going to happen.

860
00:43:26.72 --> 00:43:28.12
So you're all fired up.

861
00:43:28.12 --> 00:43:29.12
You're all aggressive.

862
00:43:29.12 --> 00:43:31.96
You're never going to quit and you're all going to die.

863
00:43:31.96 --> 00:43:32.96
Does that help us?

864
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:36.96
Does that help us achieve our overall strategic objective?

865
00:43:36.96 --> 00:43:38.12
The answer is no.

866
00:43:38.12 --> 00:43:44.68
If you pull back for a minute, if you detach from a moment mentally and possibly physically

867
00:43:44.68 --> 00:43:48.44
as well, you will likely see that there's a better approach.

868
00:43:48.44 --> 00:43:52.04
Oh, how about we call for fire support?

869
00:43:52.04 --> 00:43:56.000
How would we put down some cover, lay down some suppressive iron, move around to the flank

870
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.80
of the bunker position?

871
00:43:57.80 --> 00:44:06.88
There's a bunch of different ways that you can get this done in a much more survivable way.

872
00:44:06.88 --> 00:44:13.20
The fact is, if you're always aggressive and your mindset is I'm not going to quit, then

873
00:44:13.20 --> 00:44:14.92
you won't see those other solutions.

874
00:44:14.92 --> 00:44:16.56
And yes, that is problematic.

875
00:44:16.56 --> 00:44:17.80
Yes, that is wrong.

876
00:44:17.80 --> 00:44:21.88
And it's the same thing in dealing with people.

877
00:44:21.88 --> 00:44:29.08
If people don't respond to your leadership and your reaction that is just to get more and

878
00:44:29.08 --> 00:44:33.80
more aggressive with them, they aren't likely to come around.

879
00:44:33.80 --> 00:44:38.76
In fact, they're likely to either become hostile towards you because you're being aggressive

880
00:44:38.76 --> 00:44:47.32
towards them or they break, which each one of those is problematic bad results.

881
00:44:47.32 --> 00:44:52.84
Either my team becomes hostile towards me or I break my team either way, it's bad.

882
00:44:52.84 --> 00:44:57.04
So being aggressive all the time, no, not good.

883
00:44:57.04 --> 00:45:01.44
And same thing, same thing could be like, I default to aggressive, right?

884
00:45:01.44 --> 00:45:04.72
I literally teach people to be that way.

885
00:45:04.72 --> 00:45:09.12
But if you go too far with it, you'll end up in a bad situation, same thing with

886
00:45:09.12 --> 00:45:10.88
don't quit, right?

887
00:45:10.88 --> 00:45:16.72
Of course, of course don't quit, great attitude, my attitude is I'm never going to quit.

888
00:45:16.72 --> 00:45:18.48
I want everyone on my team to have that attitude.

889
00:45:18.48 --> 00:45:20.80
I have that attitude.

890
00:45:20.80 --> 00:45:28.60
That's like the saying in the SEAL teams don't quit, never quit.

891
00:45:28.60 --> 00:45:38.40
You have to be very, very careful that you don't confuse, don't quit with, don't try any

892
00:45:38.40 --> 00:45:43.32
other solutions or don't deviate from the original plan no matter what.

893
00:45:43.32 --> 00:45:44.32
Hey, I'm not quitting.

894
00:45:44.32 --> 00:45:46.36
I'm just going to keep doing the same thing over and over again.

895
00:45:46.36 --> 00:45:48.52
I'm going to keep going forward with the same plan.

896
00:45:48.52 --> 00:45:49.52
The plan isn't working.

897
00:45:49.52 --> 00:45:52.28
Okay, but I'm not a quit or I'm just going to keep doing the same plan.

898
00:45:52.28 --> 00:45:54.12
That's not good.

899
00:45:54.12 --> 00:45:56.08
That's not good.

900
00:45:56.08 --> 00:45:58.28
Don't quit means you don't give up.

901
00:45:58.28 --> 00:46:04.16
It actually don't quit actually means try different solutions if one of them isn't working.

902
00:46:04.16 --> 00:46:08.36
Don't quit means keep an open mind.

903
00:46:08.36 --> 00:46:12.88
Don't quit means you don't quit thinking.

904
00:46:12.88 --> 00:46:20.16
Don't quit thinking and then don't quit means you continue to keep thinking and keep addressing

905
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:23.88
a problem and keep attacking the problem until you do accomplish the mission.

906
00:46:23.88 --> 00:46:32.000
You do that through multiple different avenues, not the same avenue the whole time.

907
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.12
That's how you lead.

908
00:46:34.12 --> 00:46:35.48
That's how you get aggressive.

909
00:46:35.48 --> 00:46:42.20
That's how you actually never quit and by the way, that is how you win.

910
00:46:42.20 --> 00:46:47.56
Yeah, that morale thing.

911
00:46:47.56 --> 00:46:49.36
Remember, you've talked about morale.

912
00:46:49.36 --> 00:46:53.84
Actually, where, you know, like some,

913
00:46:53.84 --> 00:46:59.60
bosses that we like, hey, I'm not here to make you feel good or I'm not here to make friends

914
00:46:59.60 --> 00:47:02.88
or whatever.

915
00:47:02.88 --> 00:47:07.000
And sometimes like behavior or whatever things like that can lead to behavior that makes

916
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.36
people not want to work for you or not feel good about the job.

917
00:47:11.36 --> 00:47:15.92
I'm not happy about like what's the use of making someone do the job if they don't feel

918
00:47:15.92 --> 00:47:16.92
good about doing it.

919
00:47:16.92 --> 00:47:18.92
You know, like the morale is down.

920
00:47:18.92 --> 00:47:22.04
And you still think the normal morale, like people need to just toughen up, you know, like

921
00:47:22.04 --> 00:47:23.52
freaking the reality.

922
00:47:23.52 --> 00:47:27.28
You don't just not do something just because you're not feeling good that day kind of

923
00:47:27.28 --> 00:47:28.28
kind of thing.

924
00:47:28.28 --> 00:47:29.28
I thought that too.

925
00:47:29.28 --> 00:47:33.68
But man, if you have a group of people who they all don't want to do it, they're

926
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:34.68
not going to do it.

927
00:47:34.68 --> 00:47:35.68
It's problem.

928
00:47:35.68 --> 00:47:37.40
At the end of the day, they're going to not do it.

929
00:47:37.40 --> 00:47:39.24
Well, they might do that one thing that day.

930
00:47:39.24 --> 00:47:41.88
Yeah, I mean, over time, you're going to break down for sure.

931
00:47:41.88 --> 00:47:42.88
Yeah.

932
00:47:42.88 --> 00:47:44.52
You're not leading them in the right direction.

933
00:47:44.52 --> 00:47:45.52
Yeah.

934
00:47:45.52 --> 00:47:49.88
You can look forcing people to do things when you're in a position of authority.

935
00:47:49.88 --> 00:47:51.04
You can do that.

936
00:47:51.04 --> 00:47:52.04
That works.

937
00:47:52.04 --> 00:47:53.04
That's functional.

938
00:47:53.04 --> 00:47:55.64
It'll work a little bit.

939
00:47:55.64 --> 00:47:59.96
But over time, will you end up with a team that really will perform well and will continue

940
00:47:59.96 --> 00:48:01.88
to drive when they hit obstacles?

941
00:48:01.88 --> 00:48:02.88
No, you won't.

942
00:48:02.88 --> 00:48:08.68
You'll end up with a team that's doing what they're being told to do out of fear.

943
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:14.52
And that team is going to get beat by the team that is doing it because they want to do it.

944
00:48:14.52 --> 00:48:15.52
Yeah.

945
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:16.52
Yeah.

946
00:48:16.52 --> 00:48:23.000
So if it's like, you know, the guy who, you know, they, I don't think that my boss cares

947
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
about me.

948
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.36
In fact, I think that he kind of doesn't care about me.

949
00:48:26.36 --> 00:48:27.64
That's what I think.

950
00:48:27.64 --> 00:48:31.08
You're not going to do a lot of extra effort to support your boss.

951
00:48:31.08 --> 00:48:32.08
I'm sure.

952
00:48:32.08 --> 00:48:33.08
I don't want to.

953
00:48:33.08 --> 00:48:34.48
Next question, Jockel.

954
00:48:34.48 --> 00:48:40.72
Do you talk about building relationships a lot at work, even when people whom you might

955
00:48:40.72 --> 00:48:44.60
not like, even with people whom you don't like.

956
00:48:44.60 --> 00:48:50.68
Have you always been this way or did you also feel difficult?

957
00:48:50.68 --> 00:48:51.68
Also feel difficult.

958
00:48:51.68 --> 00:48:55.12
Difficulty in wanting to build relationships with those people.

959
00:48:55.12 --> 00:49:00.12
If the latter, what are the things that help you to actually want to build relationships

960
00:49:00.12 --> 00:49:01.12
with them?

961
00:49:01.12 --> 00:49:02.12
Thanks.

962
00:49:02.12 --> 00:49:13.56
So when I was a young seal, I was pretty typical young seal, pretty typical young man,

963
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:16.84
meaning I thought I was invincible.

964
00:49:16.84 --> 00:49:20.76
I thought I could beat everyone in a fight because I didn't know Jockel, so you just

965
00:49:20.76 --> 00:49:23.20
think you're just going to win, but that you're wrong.

966
00:49:23.20 --> 00:49:24.48
I thought I knew everything.

967
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:27.48
Of course.

968
00:49:27.48 --> 00:49:29.48
And I thought I was smarter than everyone else.

969
00:49:29.48 --> 00:49:32.04
Kind of typical.

970
00:49:32.04 --> 00:49:35.48
Sometimes I would rub people the wrong way.

971
00:49:35.48 --> 00:49:40.56
The people that I would rub the wrong way were especially people that I thought were not

972
00:49:40.56 --> 00:49:42.60
squared away in the chain of command.

973
00:49:42.60 --> 00:49:46.88
So if you were in my boss and I didn't think you were squared away, I was going to

974
00:49:46.88 --> 00:49:51.28
rub you the wrong way because I was going to be slightly offensive.

975
00:49:51.28 --> 00:49:53.000
As a matter of fact, I got an evaluation.

976
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.56
It's one of the first evaluations that I got when I got to a seal team.

977
00:49:56.56 --> 00:50:03.08
And back in the day, yeah, you'd get your rated 4.0 as the highest you could get and

978
00:50:03.08 --> 00:50:06.52
it would go all the way down to whatever, like one.

979
00:50:06.52 --> 00:50:10.80
But at this time, basically everyone got 4L and everything.

980
00:50:10.80 --> 00:50:13.80
And you'd have to mess up.

981
00:50:13.80 --> 00:50:14.80
You'd have to mess up.

982
00:50:14.80 --> 00:50:15.80
You'd have to mess up.

983
00:50:15.80 --> 00:50:25.04
So I got all 4Ls and I got a 3.8, which was like a major dig.

984
00:50:25.04 --> 00:50:29.24
And the dig was in relation.

985
00:50:29.24 --> 00:50:34.56
I don't know what the word was, but when I got debriefed on it, what the guy that gave

986
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:40.76
me the 3.8, what he told me, which I actually was proud of.

987
00:50:40.76 --> 00:50:42.44
Because that's how stupid I was.

988
00:50:42.44 --> 00:50:47.000
He's like, you're, you're too hostile with people that aren't squared away.

989
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.04
That's literally what he told me.

990
00:50:49.04 --> 00:50:52.88
And I was all like, whatever, you're damn right.

991
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:55.000
I'm hostile towards people that aren't squared away.

992
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I'm going to go to war.

993
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Right.

994
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Just an idiot.

995
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.72
That's what the situation was.

996
00:51:01.72 --> 00:51:08.96
And you know, it made me mad if a leader was weak and I would form these antagonistic

997
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:13.72
relationships with leaders if I thought that they were weak.

998
00:51:13.72 --> 00:51:19.04
And one of these bosses eventually that I thought I was better than, right.

999
00:51:19.04 --> 00:51:24.04
I thought I was smarter than him, right.

1000
00:51:24.04 --> 00:51:28.16
I thought that he was an idiot.

1001
00:51:28.16 --> 00:51:30.24
I should have his job, right.

1002
00:51:30.24 --> 00:51:32.12
How often do you think that, right?

1003
00:51:32.12 --> 00:51:33.88
I should have that guy's job on bed.

1004
00:51:33.88 --> 00:51:35.92
I'm smarter than that.

1005
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:41.76
And the more I showed this attitude, the worse a relationship got and the less he listened

1006
00:51:41.76 --> 00:51:47.72
to me and the less influence I had over how he did things.

1007
00:51:47.72 --> 00:51:56.60
And therefore, the worse we did and the worse our ability to perform got because he was just

1008
00:51:56.60 --> 00:52:01.08
doing things the way he thought without any good input from anyone below him in the chain

1009
00:52:01.08 --> 00:52:03.80
of command.

1010
00:52:03.80 --> 00:52:07.88
All because I had formed this antagonistic relationship with him, which was bad.

1011
00:52:07.88 --> 00:52:09.80
Because I need not listening to me.

1012
00:52:09.80 --> 00:52:23.48
I think one day, one day I said to myself, if I'm so smart, if I'm such a smart guy, why am I

1013
00:52:23.48 --> 00:52:26.68
losing?

1014
00:52:26.68 --> 00:52:29.04
Why am I losing?

1015
00:52:29.04 --> 00:52:33.76
If I'm so smart, if I am so smart, why can I get this guy to do

1016
00:52:33.76 --> 00:52:36.80
what I want him to do?

1017
00:52:36.80 --> 00:52:38.48
Even though he's my boss, doesn't matter.

1018
00:52:38.48 --> 00:52:41.60
If I'm so smart, I'm so much smarter than him.

1019
00:52:41.60 --> 00:52:46.80
Why can't I get him to do what I want him to do?

1020
00:52:46.80 --> 00:52:51.16
If I'm so smart, how come I can't have more influence over the way we operate?

1021
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:55.52
If I'm so smart and he's so dumb.

1022
00:52:55.52 --> 00:52:57.32
And that's what I realized.

1023
00:52:57.32 --> 00:53:03.72
That's what I had an awakening, an awakening that instead of blaming

1024
00:53:03.72 --> 00:53:11.08
him for being stupid, I was the one who was being stupid.

1025
00:53:11.08 --> 00:53:18.84
I had lost the ability to influence my boss because I was being stupid and because

1026
00:53:18.84 --> 00:53:20.24
of my ego.

1027
00:53:20.24 --> 00:53:22.64
I literally thought I deserved his job.

1028
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:29.96
I thought pretty much anyone, anyone that's not a job is job.

1029
00:53:29.96 --> 00:53:34.20
And therefore, since I thought that, I undermined him.

1030
00:53:34.20 --> 00:53:39.20
Instead of supporting him, instead of building a relationship with him, I undermined him.

1031
00:53:39.20 --> 00:53:47.88
Now, once I got humble and I started to build a positive relationship with him instead of

1032
00:53:47.88 --> 00:53:53.12
an antagonistic one, that started to change.

1033
00:53:53.12 --> 00:53:55.28
Because then he started listening to me.

1034
00:53:55.28 --> 00:54:01.84
He started to change some things and my influence over the whole situation became better

1035
00:54:01.84 --> 00:54:06.76
because I now had a relationship with, despite the fact that I liked the guy, despite that

1036
00:54:06.76 --> 00:54:10.64
fact, I built the relationship and the situation got better.

1037
00:54:10.64 --> 00:54:13.92
I had more influence.

1038
00:54:13.92 --> 00:54:17.20
And that became kind of my standard operating procedure.

1039
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:20.24
Was to build relationships with people.

1040
00:54:20.24 --> 00:54:24.88
Even if I didn't like them to build relationships with people so that I could have more

1041
00:54:24.88 --> 00:54:25.88
influence.

1042
00:54:25.88 --> 00:54:28.32
Now, what does that sound like?

1043
00:54:28.32 --> 00:54:35.20
That sounds like I'm kind of this manipulative to face superficial disingenuous guy.

1044
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:37.36
That's being devious and conniving.

1045
00:54:37.36 --> 00:54:38.48
Not keeping it real.

1046
00:54:38.48 --> 00:54:42.24
Not keeping it real, right?

1047
00:54:42.24 --> 00:54:44.52
But the fact is, that is not true.

1048
00:54:44.52 --> 00:54:46.80
That's not who I am.

1049
00:54:46.80 --> 00:54:50.48
You want to know who I am?

1050
00:54:50.48 --> 00:54:53.20
I'm a guy that's trying to accomplish the mission.

1051
00:54:53.20 --> 00:54:54.60
That's what I am.

1052
00:54:54.60 --> 00:55:01.44
A guy that is trying to accomplish the mission who is putting my own ego in check to build

1053
00:55:01.44 --> 00:55:04.56
a relationship with someone that I don't like, that I don't respect.

1054
00:55:04.56 --> 00:55:12.60
But what I'm trying to do is improve our operational capability.

1055
00:55:12.60 --> 00:55:17.76
That's what's more important to me.

1056
00:55:17.76 --> 00:55:24.28
Trying to arrange the situation, build the relationship so that we do better not so that

1057
00:55:24.28 --> 00:55:25.28
I get promoted.

1058
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:33.84
Not so that I'm getting some accolades, but so that we as a team do a better job.

1059
00:55:33.84 --> 00:55:41.20
Put the little feelings aside because I want the team to win.

1060
00:55:41.20 --> 00:55:47.60
So if you're having some trouble getting over your feelings and getting over your ego

1061
00:55:47.60 --> 00:55:52.56
to build relationships for the good of their team, ask yourself the same question, I asked

1062
00:55:52.56 --> 00:56:05.44
myself a long time ago, which is this, if I am so smart, why am I not winning?

1063
00:56:05.44 --> 00:56:08.72
And if you answer that question honestly, then you'll put your ego in check, you'll

1064
00:56:08.72 --> 00:56:14.04
go build the relationships that will make you and your team accomplish the mission and

1065
00:56:14.04 --> 00:56:16.04
win.

1066
00:56:16.04 --> 00:56:18.32
There you go.

1067
00:56:18.32 --> 00:56:29.40
You know what it's funny is we think about like, why you wouldn't like someone, what

1068
00:56:29.40 --> 00:56:34.40
causes you to not like someone, most of the time that's your ego anyways.

1069
00:56:34.40 --> 00:56:37.64
Most of the time that's your ego anyways.

1070
00:56:37.64 --> 00:56:43.76
So you know, you had that story of the, you know, you were consulting somebody.

1071
00:56:43.76 --> 00:56:45.56
It was like a big CEO of the idea.

1072
00:56:45.56 --> 00:56:51.32
Like a lacrosse guy, that story is probably the most common story.

1073
00:56:51.32 --> 00:56:52.64
I mean, the way you handle it different.

1074
00:56:52.64 --> 00:56:55.64
Yeah, but that's the scenario that you started with with us to our soul common men.

1075
00:56:55.64 --> 00:56:59.36
We're, yeah, they rugby the wrong way because right off the bat ECM has some kind of

1076
00:56:59.36 --> 00:57:01.36
competitive figure to you.

1077
00:57:01.36 --> 00:57:06.04
Like, you know, some, you know, competing with in your own mind in whatever.

1078
00:57:06.04 --> 00:57:09.08
And the feelings probably mutual out of the time, you know, so you guys don't like each other.

1079
00:57:09.08 --> 00:57:13.36
You know, one of anything he says, you're, you know, you're already defensive, but it's

1080
00:57:13.36 --> 00:57:15.64
weird man how you can, how that happened.

1081
00:57:15.64 --> 00:57:17.000
Like that's happened in maybe four.

1082
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.08
Not as it wasn't as overt, but just like, you know, I don't like, I went because I, not only

1083
00:57:23.08 --> 00:57:26.08
is he like, when you look at him or whatever, they're kind of competitive with you, but

1084
00:57:26.08 --> 00:57:29.68
maybe they do something just this much different than you, you know, like a just different

1085
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:30.88
in philosophy or something like that.

1086
00:57:30.88 --> 00:57:32.44
So I was like, oh, let me get in.

1087
00:57:32.44 --> 00:57:35.72
So I got, and then they opened their mouth and say, one word, you know, it's real nice.

1088
00:57:35.72 --> 00:57:37.04
You're like, oh, I love that guy.

1089
00:57:37.04 --> 00:57:39.88
You know, just one little thing, just one little like, hey, I'm cool.

1090
00:57:39.88 --> 00:57:41.12
You know, I like you kind of think.

1091
00:57:41.12 --> 00:57:42.12
And it's like, oh, man.

1092
00:57:42.12 --> 00:57:46.52
Yeah, when they say something humble to you, it disarms your ego and your all of a sudden

1093
00:57:46.52 --> 00:57:47.52
your bros.

1094
00:57:47.52 --> 00:57:48.52
Yeah, so weird.

1095
00:57:48.52 --> 00:57:52.48
But if they don't, if they escalate the ego situation, which then it's very problematic.

1096
00:57:52.48 --> 00:57:53.48
It happens all the time.

1097
00:57:53.48 --> 00:57:54.48
Yeah, it's been a whole time.

1098
00:57:54.48 --> 00:57:57.70
I mean, really, that's the natural course of things, because you do have to put on the

1099
00:57:57.70 --> 00:57:59.88
brakes on your feelings and be okay.

1100
00:57:59.88 --> 00:58:02.36
Let's make a different kind of decision and the automatic one.

1101
00:58:02.36 --> 00:58:04.36
I got to switch to manual real quick.

1102
00:58:04.36 --> 00:58:07.48
And then boom, but the bottom line is you're going to interact with all kinds of different

1103
00:58:07.48 --> 00:58:08.48
people.

1104
00:58:08.48 --> 00:58:13.48
Any kind of team whatsoever, which is most human beings interact with other human beings

1105
00:58:13.48 --> 00:58:16.76
through their job, through their life, through, I mean, you could apply this to your family,

1106
00:58:16.76 --> 00:58:17.76
too, right?

1107
00:58:17.76 --> 00:58:21.36
There's someone in your family that you don't get along with.

1108
00:58:21.36 --> 00:58:23.36
Well, what good does it do?

1109
00:58:23.36 --> 00:58:28.44
Does it make your family unit better when you let those emotions play out and let your

1110
00:58:28.44 --> 00:58:29.44
ego play out?

1111
00:58:29.44 --> 00:58:30.44
No, it doesn't.

1112
00:58:30.44 --> 00:58:31.44
You're better off.

1113
00:58:31.44 --> 00:58:32.44
You'll get further.

1114
00:58:32.44 --> 00:58:37.20
And you'll have a better, you'll have a better life in your family.

1115
00:58:37.20 --> 00:58:41.44
If you put your ego in check and say, you know what, I'm just going to build a relationship

1116
00:58:41.44 --> 00:58:42.44
with this person.

1117
00:58:42.44 --> 00:58:44.24
It's going to make everything better in smoother.

1118
00:58:44.24 --> 00:58:50.24
But it's like, man, if you, I feel like you can take the place of any marriage counselor

1119
00:58:50.24 --> 00:58:52.44
by just saying that for real.

1120
00:58:52.44 --> 00:58:54.48
Like, all you got to do is, and they got to do it.

1121
00:58:54.48 --> 00:58:58.24
But all you got to do is ask, like, is this going to help the relationship with my wife or

1122
00:58:58.24 --> 00:59:02.04
my family, whoever it is in your, is this going to help the relationship if I do this or

1123
00:59:02.04 --> 00:59:03.84
don't do this or isn't going to hurt it?

1124
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:04.84
And that's it.

1125
00:59:04.84 --> 00:59:06.12
That's a super general question.

1126
00:59:06.12 --> 00:59:08.48
And whatever, but it's so cut and dry most of the time.

1127
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:09.76
Of course, it's that exception.

1128
00:59:09.76 --> 00:59:11.64
But generally speaking, it's pretty cut and dry.

1129
00:59:11.64 --> 00:59:12.64
I'm going to go, okay.

1130
00:59:12.64 --> 00:59:16.48
And a lot of times, just like I said, it has to do with like your ego or your, you know,

1131
00:59:16.48 --> 00:59:21.68
this, this sense of vengeance, little micro sense of vengeance because I can't believe she

1132
00:59:21.68 --> 00:59:25.24
doesn't respect the fact that I took out the trash.

1133
00:59:25.24 --> 00:59:27.32
You know, she asked me to take the trash all the time.

1134
00:59:27.32 --> 00:59:30.000
Finally, when I do it, nothing, you know, like, tell it.

1135
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.32
It's just that.

1136
00:59:31.32 --> 00:59:36.92
I was talking to the friend of mine and we were talking about, you know, I've talked

1137
00:59:36.92 --> 00:59:40.44
about the mute knee that I had, you know, to the opatune.

1138
00:59:40.44 --> 00:59:41.72
But we had a mute knee.

1139
00:59:41.72 --> 00:59:44.76
We had a mute knee against our, our, paltune commander.

1140
00:59:44.76 --> 00:59:48.24
We fired, he got fired and then the other guy that came in to take his place was like,

1141
00:59:48.24 --> 00:59:49.24
the best guy.

1142
00:59:49.24 --> 00:59:53.84
And I was talking to a guy that worked with him much later when he was a senior senior

1143
00:59:53.84 --> 00:59:55.64
guy.

1144
00:59:55.64 --> 01:00:01.04
And I was telling him, I was like, oh, when I talk on the podcast about the paltune commander,

1145
01:00:01.04 --> 01:00:04.32
that was like the best, that's when I'm talking to he's like, no way.

1146
01:00:04.32 --> 01:00:08.04
And this guy working with these senior guy.

1147
01:00:08.04 --> 01:00:12.80
And he says, you know, when he, when I worked with him, he would take out the trash from

1148
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:14.20
the office every day.

1149
01:00:14.20 --> 01:00:17.20
And I started laughing about that.

1150
01:00:17.20 --> 01:00:18.20
That's right.

1151
01:00:18.20 --> 01:00:21.56
And I'd be, look, and he was saying, like, oh, I look at him and be like, sir, you

1152
01:00:21.56 --> 01:00:22.56
know, you don't need to do that.

1153
01:00:22.56 --> 01:00:23.60
He's like, no, no, no, it's a good.

1154
01:00:23.60 --> 01:00:24.64
You know, someone's got to take out the trash.

1155
01:00:24.64 --> 01:00:25.64
I got it.

1156
01:00:25.64 --> 01:00:26.64
This is a seat.

1157
01:00:26.64 --> 01:00:31.28
Why that shouldn't have been taking out trash for 25 years.

1158
01:00:31.28 --> 01:00:32.28
Taking out the trash.

1159
01:00:32.28 --> 01:00:33.68
What was he picking up, brass?

1160
01:00:33.68 --> 01:00:34.68
He's picking up brass.

1161
01:00:34.68 --> 01:00:35.68
Taking out trash.

1162
01:00:35.68 --> 01:00:39.40
You know, that's, that's being humble.

1163
01:00:39.40 --> 01:00:40.88
Yeah.

1164
01:00:40.88 --> 01:00:42.88
Being humble goes a long way.

1165
01:00:42.88 --> 01:00:43.88
Yeah.

1166
01:00:43.88 --> 01:00:44.88
Next year.

1167
01:00:44.88 --> 01:00:46.48
We got time for one more.

1168
01:00:46.48 --> 01:00:48.88
Because I got stuffed.

1169
01:00:48.88 --> 01:00:49.88
Sure.

1170
01:00:49.88 --> 01:00:50.88
Hi, Jockel.

1171
01:00:50.88 --> 01:00:55.24
I'm a veteran in graduate school.

1172
01:00:55.24 --> 01:00:58.68
My mother passed away in April, and I took a few weeks off.

1173
01:00:58.68 --> 01:01:02.04
While that was helpful, I'm struggling, returning to work.

1174
01:01:02.04 --> 01:01:04.08
My peers are younger and inexperienced.

1175
01:01:04.08 --> 01:01:06.48
I'm the oldest in the cohort.

1176
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:10.16
And probably the first vet to come to this grad program.

1177
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:12.56
I've already had some uphill battles.

1178
01:01:12.56 --> 01:01:16.20
And up to this point, I truly believe I was worthy of my own suffering.

1179
01:01:16.20 --> 01:01:22.48
Now, though, after solving on a plane while listening to episode 122, I don't feel

1180
01:01:22.48 --> 01:01:23.48
as worthy.

1181
01:01:23.48 --> 01:01:25.32
I wasn't there for my mother when she died.

1182
01:01:25.32 --> 01:01:30.60
In fact, I cut her out due to her drinking, which is what killed her.

1183
01:01:30.60 --> 01:01:36.12
I've lost people close to me in the past and in the service, but this is different.

1184
01:01:36.12 --> 01:01:37.92
I know one thing, I'm a fighter.

1185
01:01:37.92 --> 01:01:48.92
I've had to fight all my life to get where I am, but I'm feeling deflated.

1186
01:01:48.92 --> 01:01:53.44
I mean, to start with, of course, you feel deflated.

1187
01:01:53.44 --> 01:01:57.24
Because you lost your mom.

1188
01:01:57.24 --> 01:01:58.88
That's normal.

1189
01:01:58.88 --> 01:02:07.40
But what is not normal and what you have to fight against is staying deflated.

1190
01:02:07.40 --> 01:02:15.60
So, I mean, listen, your mom has gone and you should certainly mourn that.

1191
01:02:15.60 --> 01:02:20.000
You weren't by her side when she died.

1192
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.60
This is due to the fact that you had to cut her off and you had to cut her off because

1193
01:02:25.60 --> 01:02:27.56
of her drinking.

1194
01:02:27.56 --> 01:02:31.56
If you don't cut someone off when they're going down that path, you're only enabling

1195
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:32.56
them.

1196
01:02:32.56 --> 01:02:39.76
And that is not the right thing to do.

1197
01:02:39.76 --> 01:02:47.40
And of course, we want to be able to save everyone.

1198
01:02:47.40 --> 01:02:49.68
That's absolutely.

1199
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:56.000
We want to be able to save everyone, especially our own family members.

1200
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.24
But the fact of the matter is that you just can't save everyone.

1201
01:03:04.24 --> 01:03:07.68
No one can.

1202
01:03:07.68 --> 01:03:10.24
No one can.

1203
01:03:10.24 --> 01:03:18.48
Addiction is in many cases stronger than us.

1204
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:23.92
Even anything stronger than love.

1205
01:03:23.92 --> 01:03:27.72
Believe it or not, stronger than life itself sometimes.

1206
01:03:27.72 --> 01:03:33.84
That's how strong addiction is.

1207
01:03:33.84 --> 01:03:46.52
And you cannot and are not expected to be able to defeat that.

1208
01:03:46.52 --> 01:03:53.20
So you did what you could.

1209
01:03:53.20 --> 01:04:05.12
And in the end, the battle was lost not because of you but because of addiction.

1210
01:04:05.12 --> 01:04:17.48
And it is hard to face that kind of loss.

1211
01:04:17.48 --> 01:04:22.64
But now, how are you going to look at this?

1212
01:04:22.64 --> 01:04:28.72
How are you going to deal with this?

1213
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:30.60
I look at it like this.

1214
01:04:30.60 --> 01:04:34.32
Your mother?

1215
01:04:34.32 --> 01:04:42.44
Your mother gave you a gift, a precious gift.

1216
01:04:42.44 --> 01:04:47.60
She gave you the gift of knowledge.

1217
01:04:47.60 --> 01:04:54.04
That knowledge allows you to see how destructive that force of addiction can be.

1218
01:04:54.04 --> 01:05:00.12
You saw it, destroy her.

1219
01:05:00.12 --> 01:05:04.92
You saw that addiction, destroy her because she showed it to you.

1220
01:05:04.92 --> 01:05:09.40
That was her last gift to you.

1221
01:05:09.40 --> 01:05:18.80
She's actually given you life twice once at birth and once at her death.

1222
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:26.80
She's actually shown you how to live by showing you how not to live.

1223
01:05:26.80 --> 01:05:40.56
So thank your mother for that.

1224
01:05:40.56 --> 01:05:41.56
Literally, thank her.

1225
01:05:41.56 --> 01:05:54.24
Literally go to her grave side and get down on your knees and say thank you to her.

1226
01:05:54.24 --> 01:05:59.28
And then tell her that you won't let her down.

1227
01:05:59.28 --> 01:06:07.52
And then tell her that you will learn from her lesson.

1228
01:06:07.52 --> 01:06:16.56
And then tell her that you will go on to live an incredible life.

1229
01:06:16.56 --> 01:06:22.08
A life that she would be proud of, a life that she didn't have.

1230
01:06:22.08 --> 01:06:35.44
But a life that she is making sure you can have.

1231
01:06:35.44 --> 01:06:39.48
Now you said that you're a fighter.

1232
01:06:39.48 --> 01:06:42.60
And that's one thing you know is that you're a fighter.

1233
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:48.20
Well now get out there.

1234
01:06:48.20 --> 01:07:00.68
And you know that question and kind of thinking about the answer to that question.

1235
01:07:00.68 --> 01:07:06.96
That got me thinking about an article that I read about Anthony Bourdain.

1236
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:15.96
And Anthony Bourdain, obviously he was about a successful as anyone could be.

1237
01:07:15.96 --> 01:07:26.56
I mean he was a successful guy in so many aspects and yet he killed himself.

1238
01:07:26.56 --> 01:07:29.68
And I didn't know him personally.

1239
01:07:29.68 --> 01:07:36.20
But you know he knew people that I know, he was friends with Joe Rogan.

1240
01:07:36.20 --> 01:07:38.96
He was friends with Harley Flan again.

1241
01:07:38.96 --> 01:07:47.88
He was friends with guys that, guys that look good guys.

1242
01:07:47.88 --> 01:07:56.32
And so in that way I kind of felt like I knew what kind of a guy was at least.

1243
01:07:56.32 --> 01:08:02.36
And even from the outside, even without having any connections to him at all, he was a kind

1244
01:08:02.36 --> 01:08:11.96
of guy that had just about everything that that most people would want.

1245
01:08:11.96 --> 01:08:17.56
And even still I mean obviously that wasn't enough.

1246
01:08:17.56 --> 01:08:27.40
Well in the article that I read there was a quote from Anthony Bourdain's books and the

1247
01:08:27.40 --> 01:08:32.32
book was called A Cooks Tour.

1248
01:08:32.32 --> 01:08:37.60
He said in this book, I wanted adventures.

1249
01:08:37.60 --> 01:08:44.64
I wanted to go up the non-river to the heart of darkness in Cambodia.

1250
01:08:44.64 --> 01:08:52.88
I wanted to ride out into a desert on camelback, sand and dunes in every direction.

1251
01:08:52.88 --> 01:08:57.92
Eat whole roasted lamb with my fingers.

1252
01:08:57.92 --> 01:09:02.40
I wanted to kick snow off my boots in a mafia nightclub in Russia.

1253
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:06.32
I wanted to play with automatic weapons in Panam Pen.

1254
01:09:06.32 --> 01:09:12.24
Recap for the past in a small oyster village in France.

1255
01:09:12.24 --> 01:09:19.72
Step into a CD, neon lit, pukarilla in rural Mexico.

1256
01:09:19.72 --> 01:09:24.52
I wanted to run road blocks in the middle of the night, blowing past Angry Malaysia with

1257
01:09:24.52 --> 01:09:31.28
a handful of hurled marble packs.

1258
01:09:31.28 --> 01:09:34.12
Experience fear, excitement, wonder.

1259
01:09:34.12 --> 01:09:37.40
I wanted kicks.

1260
01:09:37.40 --> 01:09:45.52
The kind of melodramatic thrills and chills I'd yearn for since childhood.

1261
01:09:45.52 --> 01:09:53.08
The kind of adventure I'd found as a little boy in the pages of my 10-10 comic books.

1262
01:09:53.08 --> 01:10:05.56
I wanted to see the world and I wanted the world to be just like the movies.

1263
01:10:05.56 --> 01:10:17.32
That's what Anthony Bourdain said, just like the movies.

1264
01:10:17.32 --> 01:10:26.32
You know what to me, the world is not like the movies.

1265
01:10:26.32 --> 01:10:28.28
The movies aren't real.

1266
01:10:28.28 --> 01:10:33.08
They don't exist.

1267
01:10:33.08 --> 01:10:37.64
But you do.

1268
01:10:37.64 --> 01:10:44.000
And life, this life is better than any movie there is.

1269
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.20
Is there supposed to provoke emotion?

1270
01:10:47.20 --> 01:10:52.56
Do you supposed to make you feel something?

1271
01:10:52.56 --> 01:10:54.60
But I have a better idea.

1272
01:10:54.60 --> 01:11:01.40
Go out into the world and actually feel it.

1273
01:11:01.40 --> 01:11:10.68
Go feel joy and love and triumph and rapture and ecstasy and glory.

1274
01:11:10.68 --> 01:11:18.08
You'll feel those things.

1275
01:11:18.08 --> 01:11:24.80
And you know with those feelings, there will be other feelings as well.

1276
01:11:24.80 --> 01:11:33.80
There will be sorrow and pain and sadness and desolation and suffering.

1277
01:11:33.80 --> 01:11:40.80
There will be all those feelings too.

1278
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:46.48
But you know what?

1279
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:50.36
That's okay.

1280
01:11:50.36 --> 01:11:51.68
That's okay.

1281
01:11:51.68 --> 01:11:53.88
Take both sides.

1282
01:11:53.88 --> 01:11:54.88
Feel all that.

1283
01:11:54.88 --> 01:11:56.68
That's what life is.

1284
01:11:56.68 --> 01:12:03.76
Those feelings, those emotions, those highs and those lows.

1285
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:10.16
Those are life.

1286
01:12:10.16 --> 01:12:22.64
And those emotions and those feelings are better than any movie because they are real.

1287
01:12:22.64 --> 01:12:28.36
So make your own comic book.

1288
01:12:28.36 --> 01:12:31.24
Make your life your own movie.

1289
01:12:31.24 --> 01:12:35.96
Actually make it better than a movie.

1290
01:12:35.96 --> 01:12:44.84
Not better because it's more adventurous or more romantic or more melodramatic.

1291
01:12:44.84 --> 01:12:52.92
Make it better because it's real.

1292
01:12:52.92 --> 01:12:55.20
It's real so it is better.

1293
01:12:55.20 --> 01:13:02.08
And you know what, real comes with some downsides.

1294
01:13:02.08 --> 01:13:13.76
Real comes with some darkness.

1295
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:18.000
But that's okay.

1296
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.88
It's okay because when you know the darkness, the light becomes even brighter.

1297
01:13:24.88 --> 01:13:46.36
So go out there, move toward the light, move toward the light and live.

1298
01:13:46.36 --> 01:14:00.44
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1299
01:14:00.44 --> 01:14:12.40
So echo, let's talk to people a little bit about how to support this podcast and at

1300
01:14:12.40 --> 01:14:19.56
the same time move themselves a little further away from the darkness and a little bit closer

1301
01:14:19.56 --> 01:14:22.76
to the light.

1302
01:14:22.76 --> 01:14:30.24
Because we make the podcast so everyone can learn and if you want to support the podcast,

1303
01:14:30.24 --> 01:14:33.88
there are some really good ways to do it.

1304
01:14:33.88 --> 01:14:37.96
And that's the goal.

1305
01:14:37.96 --> 01:14:42.52
Podcasting you're supporting yourself at the same time.

1306
01:14:42.52 --> 01:14:47.04
We got a big go hand in hand, a 300,000 percent.

1307
01:14:47.04 --> 01:14:48.48
Not possible but what they were like.

1308
01:14:48.48 --> 01:14:49.48
Yeah that's what I said.

1309
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:52.64
Can you agree one thing in a highly agree the 110 percent?

1310
01:14:52.64 --> 01:14:57.68
I agree with you but I think I feel 10 percent even more strong than what you just

1311
01:14:57.68 --> 01:14:58.68
said.

1312
01:14:58.68 --> 01:15:02.48
Technically that could be a bad just thing.

1313
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:10.88
I mean yes so we'll start with Origin, Origin USA in Maine, Farmington Maine to be exact,

1314
01:15:10.88 --> 01:15:11.88
American made products.

1315
01:15:11.88 --> 01:15:12.88
What do we got?

1316
01:15:12.88 --> 01:15:15.24
Okay, guise that's really the flagship.

1317
01:15:15.24 --> 01:15:21.12
I like the word flagship but the flagship product is the guise.

1318
01:15:21.12 --> 01:15:26.16
Made for Gigi to specifically for Gigi to in America.

1319
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:34.20
So made for specifically to Gigi but usable for many different activities.

1320
01:15:34.20 --> 01:15:36.04
Like making a suit?

1321
01:15:36.04 --> 01:15:37.04
Rashcards.

1322
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:38.04
Oh yeah.

1323
01:15:38.04 --> 01:15:40.68
Okay, if you say guise it's like flagship right which I agree with.

1324
01:15:40.68 --> 01:15:42.48
They also have rashcards.

1325
01:15:42.48 --> 01:15:43.48
Other stuff.

1326
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:44.48
Yeah.

1327
01:15:44.48 --> 01:15:45.48
Compression gear.

1328
01:15:45.48 --> 01:15:46.48
Compression gear.

1329
01:15:46.48 --> 01:15:48.08
Spats if you will.

1330
01:15:48.08 --> 01:15:49.92
Yeah, for sure.

1331
01:15:49.92 --> 01:15:52.92
But the guise aren't just like guise though.

1332
01:15:52.92 --> 01:15:56.96
You can see them saying they're not just a general guise that guise made in America.

1333
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:00.04
By the way, for Gigi to specifically.

1334
01:16:00.04 --> 01:16:04.20
When you move in Gigi to the different than moving in, I don't know whatever else you might

1335
01:16:04.20 --> 01:16:05.20
wear guise.

1336
01:16:05.20 --> 01:16:07.20
That tennis.

1337
01:16:07.20 --> 01:16:10.56
Whatever, you were saying you were going to make a suit with the dragon.

1338
01:16:10.56 --> 01:16:11.56
Yeah, that is kind of crazy.

1339
01:16:11.56 --> 01:16:15.96
I actually have an idea of something to make with the dragon weave.

1340
01:16:15.96 --> 01:16:17.24
I'm going to talk to Pete about.

1341
01:16:17.24 --> 01:16:20.24
All right, what is it, let me stick to reveal.

1342
01:16:20.24 --> 01:16:23.72
Believe it or not, boots.

1343
01:16:23.72 --> 01:16:24.72
Yeah.

1344
01:16:24.72 --> 01:16:25.72
Okay, yeah.

1345
01:16:25.72 --> 01:16:26.72
So they wouldn't be fooled right?

1346
01:16:26.72 --> 01:16:31.48
No, no, they'd be very similar to the old school Vietnam jungle boots.

1347
01:16:31.48 --> 01:16:34.36
But they'd have the dragon weave instead of canvas.

1348
01:16:34.36 --> 01:16:36.64
They'd have dragon weave.

1349
01:16:36.64 --> 01:16:42.76
And because which I think is the, literally the perfect material for the jungle, but old

1350
01:16:42.76 --> 01:16:44.36
school jungle boots are part leather.

1351
01:16:44.36 --> 01:16:47.000
They're like leather around the toe in the heel.

1352
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.88
Then they have canvas on the sides and I wore jungle, and I still wear jungle boots.

1353
01:16:52.88 --> 01:16:53.88
I love jungle boots.

1354
01:16:53.88 --> 01:16:54.88
So yeah.

1355
01:16:54.88 --> 01:17:02.000
So I, but if we made, because the cotton canvas does stay wet longer, but if we use the

1356
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.52
dragon weave, it dries quicker because it's a blend.

1357
01:17:05.52 --> 01:17:09.16
But cotton is also very comfortable to wear.

1358
01:17:09.16 --> 01:17:10.88
It allows circulation.

1359
01:17:10.88 --> 01:17:13.36
So anyways, that's a wild mull talk to Pete.

1360
01:17:13.36 --> 01:17:14.36
We'll make it happen.

1361
01:17:14.36 --> 01:17:19.20
So the, the shorts that I have, if anyone else can have is dragon weave.

1362
01:17:19.20 --> 01:17:20.20
Right.

1363
01:17:20.20 --> 01:17:21.20
That is okay.

1364
01:17:21.20 --> 01:17:22.20
So let's talk to Pete about it.

1365
01:17:22.20 --> 01:17:24.32
Let me make some more and we went to the thing that's holding the other thing.

1366
01:17:24.32 --> 01:17:29.48
But here's, here's what I do remember if you, since you brought up boots.

1367
01:17:29.48 --> 01:17:31.76
Where, okay, so those shorts, you know, I have kids.

1368
01:17:31.76 --> 01:17:37.04
And with kids comes messes, you know, when we're there, spill some, I don't know, whatever.

1369
01:17:37.04 --> 01:17:38.92
So stuff will land on those shorts.

1370
01:17:38.92 --> 01:17:41.60
And you know, the kind of worst thing, I don't want to take off the shorts and go wash

1371
01:17:41.60 --> 01:17:43.84
them like, let me just put some water.

1372
01:17:43.84 --> 01:17:46.12
But then some of the messes is like, you can't just put water.

1373
01:17:46.12 --> 01:17:47.12
It goes away.

1374
01:17:47.12 --> 01:17:48.12
You got to scrub it.

1375
01:17:48.12 --> 01:17:50.44
But if they're like normal shorts, I'm going to scrub it with like a brush and it's

1376
01:17:50.44 --> 01:17:52.56
going to kind of mess up the shorts a little bit right there.

1377
01:17:52.56 --> 01:17:56.16
You know, it'll make it like kind of friddle fray or something like that.

1378
01:17:56.16 --> 01:18:00.40
Brad, now these ones, Brad, I'm scrubbing it with a steel wool thing to get the thing out.

1379
01:18:00.40 --> 01:18:04.76
Brad, the thing is like new still, aside from like the cotton part feeds, right?

1380
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:05.76
You know how to blend, right?

1381
01:18:05.76 --> 01:18:07.40
So the cotton ones will feed.

1382
01:18:07.40 --> 01:18:08.40
So this is awesome.

1383
01:18:08.40 --> 01:18:15.40
It's a little gray straight with black as Brad's dope incidental, dopeness improvement.

1384
01:18:15.40 --> 01:18:16.40
Yeah.

1385
01:18:16.40 --> 01:18:17.40
In the aesthetic look.

1386
01:18:17.40 --> 01:18:18.40
There you go.

1387
01:18:18.40 --> 01:18:19.40
That's a side note.

1388
01:18:19.40 --> 01:18:22.04
But I'm saying it's tough with the use of them saying, so it kind of makes sense.

1389
01:18:22.04 --> 01:18:26.52
Now, dragonweed boots, boom, you're in the jungle fishing, whatever else we're doing

1390
01:18:26.52 --> 01:18:27.52
with them and they handle.

1391
01:18:27.52 --> 01:18:28.52
Yeah.

1392
01:18:28.52 --> 01:18:29.52
Yeah.

1393
01:18:29.52 --> 01:18:30.52
I don't want to find it.

1394
01:18:30.52 --> 01:18:31.52
Would you make it like on the inside?

1395
01:18:31.52 --> 01:18:33.16
Would it be a, what do you call water?

1396
01:18:33.16 --> 01:18:34.16
We're reset proof through whatever.

1397
01:18:34.16 --> 01:18:36.52
That's the thing with jungle, but you don't want them waterproof.

1398
01:18:36.52 --> 01:18:37.52
They're booting.

1399
01:18:37.52 --> 01:18:39.16
They're really, really, you have little eyelets.

1400
01:18:39.16 --> 01:18:40.16
Oh yeah.

1401
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:41.16
Little drains.

1402
01:18:41.16 --> 01:18:43.04
So you want them highly breathable.

1403
01:18:43.04 --> 01:18:45.24
Like not even breathable.

1404
01:18:45.24 --> 01:18:46.24
Open.

1405
01:18:46.24 --> 01:18:47.24
Yeah.

1406
01:18:47.24 --> 01:18:48.24
There's holes.

1407
01:18:48.24 --> 01:18:49.44
It's purposely put in there.

1408
01:18:49.44 --> 01:18:52.56
So that's concept is real jujitsu ish, you know?

1409
01:18:52.56 --> 01:18:55.68
Cause like on at first thought, you'd be like, hey, you're walking water.

1410
01:18:55.68 --> 01:18:56.68
We need to fight that water.

1411
01:18:56.68 --> 01:18:58.68
No, it's like, yeah, allow the water.

1412
01:18:58.68 --> 01:19:00.68
You didn't allow the water out there.

1413
01:19:00.68 --> 01:19:01.68
Yeah, man.

1414
01:19:01.68 --> 01:19:02.68
That's good.

1415
01:19:02.68 --> 01:19:03.68
See Brad, that's why you're advanced.

1416
01:19:03.68 --> 01:19:05.68
See, you think about this can see.

1417
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:08.96
Speaking of being advanced and comfortable.

1418
01:19:08.96 --> 01:19:11.56
Advanced comfort with the joggers and the sweats.

1419
01:19:11.56 --> 01:19:12.56
It's my experience.

1420
01:19:12.56 --> 01:19:13.56
Try for yourself.

1421
01:19:13.56 --> 01:19:16.40
Many people actually, I saw a guy today, maybe yesterday, today.

1422
01:19:16.40 --> 01:19:17.40
I forgot.

1423
01:19:17.40 --> 01:19:22.40
But he got the hoodie, one of, origins hoodie, boom, seconded that exact notion.

1424
01:19:22.40 --> 01:19:23.68
Most comfortable hoodie ever.

1425
01:19:23.68 --> 01:19:24.68
He's ever had.

1426
01:19:24.68 --> 01:19:25.68
That's a bold statement.

1427
01:19:25.68 --> 01:19:29.72
And I could just seat tell from his profile picture that he knew about comfort.

1428
01:19:29.72 --> 01:19:30.72
I don't know.

1429
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:32.12
It just, I just could feel it.

1430
01:19:32.12 --> 01:19:33.44
Nonetheless, it happened.

1431
01:19:33.44 --> 01:19:34.44
Factually.

1432
01:19:34.44 --> 01:19:38.72
Also, we got some supplements up there on the origin.

1433
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:41.32
Main.com website.

1434
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:42.72
You can get some supplements.

1435
01:19:42.72 --> 01:19:44.16
What kind of supplements, pal?

1436
01:19:44.16 --> 01:19:45.16
Some good ones.

1437
01:19:45.16 --> 01:19:46.16
Yep.

1438
01:19:46.16 --> 01:19:48.16
So, joint warfare.

1439
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:51.72
Darwin, would we call that one a flagship supplement?

1440
01:19:51.72 --> 01:19:52.72
You could call every time.

1441
01:19:52.72 --> 01:19:53.72
I'm going to call that a flagship.

1442
01:19:53.72 --> 01:19:55.88
Yeah, the flagship is good, man.

1443
01:19:55.88 --> 01:19:59.16
By the way, someone said, someone said on social media.

1444
01:19:59.16 --> 01:20:02.52
Go back to the old way you were doing this approach.

1445
01:20:02.52 --> 01:20:05.36
Then, no way, he sounds clunky.

1446
01:20:05.36 --> 01:20:07.36
He said, give it back to echo.

1447
01:20:07.36 --> 01:20:09.36
He said, you know what I said?

1448
01:20:09.36 --> 01:20:10.36
Couldn't take it anymore.

1449
01:20:10.36 --> 01:20:13.28
He said, I'm going to be honest.

1450
01:20:13.28 --> 01:20:19.68
I will accept the possibility, probability of you not being the only one that thought

1451
01:20:19.68 --> 01:20:20.68
that.

1452
01:20:20.68 --> 01:20:22.24
So, I'm going to go with it.

1453
01:20:22.24 --> 01:20:24.08
You know, there was that one guy though.

1454
01:20:24.08 --> 01:20:25.08
He was fired up.

1455
01:20:25.08 --> 01:20:26.08
Enough to tweet me.

1456
01:20:26.08 --> 01:20:28.08
And say, bra.

1457
01:20:28.08 --> 01:20:29.08
Sounds clunky.

1458
01:20:29.08 --> 01:20:30.72
Dang, I kind of appreciated it.

1459
01:20:30.72 --> 01:20:31.72
You're so far.

1460
01:20:31.72 --> 01:20:32.72
Really do another thing.

1461
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:35.72
We could have a separate podcast where you could just do so far.

1462
01:20:35.72 --> 01:20:36.72
It's a whole lot.

1463
01:20:36.72 --> 01:20:39.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can kind of choose.

1464
01:20:39.72 --> 01:20:41.28
Choose your own support.

1465
01:20:41.28 --> 01:20:42.28
Yeah, maybe.

1466
01:20:42.28 --> 01:20:44.36
Nonetheless, for now, this is what we're doing.

1467
01:20:44.36 --> 01:20:46.000
We're going with joint warfare.

1468
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Joy warfare.

1469
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Good for your joints.

1470
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.56
Or make a three is good for your joints.

1471
01:20:50.56 --> 01:20:51.56
And that's in krill oil.

1472
01:20:51.56 --> 01:20:54.60
So you got joint warfare, glucosiming, conjointing, and curcumint.

1473
01:20:54.60 --> 01:20:56.40
That helps you bring by the way.

1474
01:20:56.40 --> 01:20:57.40
As we find out.

1475
01:20:57.40 --> 01:21:00.40
Additionally, then you got a joint.

1476
01:21:00.40 --> 01:21:01.40
That's a lot of pressure.

1477
01:21:01.40 --> 01:21:02.40
Yeah.

1478
01:21:02.40 --> 01:21:03.40
Ronda Patrick, right?

1479
01:21:03.40 --> 01:21:04.40
Yeah.

1480
01:21:04.40 --> 01:21:06.40
It was like I read that two by the way.

1481
01:21:06.40 --> 01:21:07.40
It's good.

1482
01:21:07.40 --> 01:21:09.40
Then you got, okay, so you got joint warfare, boom.

1483
01:21:09.40 --> 01:21:10.40
We close them in conjointing.

1484
01:21:10.40 --> 01:21:14.12
That's for, I think, cardilegium, phamountmistic, and joints, all this stuff.

1485
01:21:14.12 --> 01:21:16.96
Boom, curcumint for some brains and memory stuff, boom.

1486
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:17.96
That's joint warfare.

1487
01:21:17.96 --> 01:21:19.76
Then you got jacos, super krill.

1488
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:20.76
Mm-hmm.

1489
01:21:20.76 --> 01:21:21.76
That's for you joint.

1490
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:22.76
So make a threes.

1491
01:21:22.76 --> 01:21:24.76
And that's also for other parts of your anatomy.

1492
01:21:24.76 --> 01:21:25.76
Yeah.

1493
01:21:25.76 --> 01:21:29.04
It will say your whole internal system.

1494
01:21:29.04 --> 01:21:30.04
You may use your eyes.

1495
01:21:30.04 --> 01:21:31.04
Eyeballs.

1496
01:21:31.04 --> 01:21:32.04
Eyeballs.

1497
01:21:32.04 --> 01:21:33.04
Eyeballs.

1498
01:21:33.04 --> 01:21:34.04
Eyeballs.

1499
01:21:34.04 --> 01:21:35.04
Organs.

1500
01:21:35.04 --> 01:21:37.52
Can you crack open a krill oil capsule and put it directly into your eyes?

1501
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:38.52
Is that a good thing?

1502
01:21:38.52 --> 01:21:39.52
Yeah.

1503
01:21:39.52 --> 01:21:40.52
I'm assuming no.

1504
01:21:40.52 --> 01:21:42.52
I'm not sure.

1505
01:21:42.52 --> 01:21:43.52
Yeah.

1506
01:21:43.52 --> 01:21:44.88
But yeah, let's not do that, I think.

1507
01:21:44.88 --> 01:21:47.48
I've been on krill oil for so long.

1508
01:21:47.48 --> 01:21:48.48
Yeah.

1509
01:21:48.48 --> 01:21:51.04
People, like, I don't want to ever go off with it.

1510
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:55.04
Yeah, I think that's a good idea to never go off of it.

1511
01:21:55.04 --> 01:21:59.44
The reason is because I had a guy many years ago that was a, this is when I was

1512
01:21:59.44 --> 01:22:03.28
probably 35.

1513
01:22:03.28 --> 01:22:06.44
I met a guy that was 53.

1514
01:22:06.44 --> 01:22:07.44
I think.

1515
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:09.44
And he was jerked.

1516
01:22:09.44 --> 01:22:15.16
And he was jacked, but he wasn't jacked like a big body builder juice up guy.

1517
01:22:15.16 --> 01:22:17.68
Just jacked like totally athletic.

1518
01:22:17.68 --> 01:22:19.68
And in really great shape.

1519
01:22:19.68 --> 01:22:23.88
And I was like, hey man, what's the deal with, you know, and he's like, I take it all

1520
01:22:23.88 --> 01:22:24.88
oil.

1521
01:22:24.88 --> 01:22:25.88
That's, he's like, that's the secret.

1522
01:22:25.88 --> 01:22:26.88
He was like tributing.

1523
01:22:26.88 --> 01:22:27.88
Yeah.

1524
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:28.88
Yeah.

1525
01:22:28.88 --> 01:22:31.64
And so, how he was a competitive power lifter at one time.

1526
01:22:31.64 --> 01:22:34.44
So he had maintained and continued to work out.

1527
01:22:34.44 --> 01:22:38.12
But he was basically saying that to me as if we already knew that.

1528
01:22:38.12 --> 01:22:40.48
But we already know that you got a jacked deal.

1529
01:22:40.48 --> 01:22:41.64
Like, we, that's a given.

1530
01:22:41.64 --> 01:22:43.76
I just, because I was talking to him for a while.

1531
01:22:43.76 --> 01:22:45.64
And we were talking about lifting or talking about this.

1532
01:22:45.64 --> 01:22:48.36
And, and then finally, you know, I got to like, so what do you think it is?

1533
01:22:48.36 --> 01:22:50.24
And he's like, I take it all oil.

1534
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:52.72
This was before, and I was like, okay.

1535
01:22:52.72 --> 01:22:56.40
Sometimes when somebody tells you something, you're just like, you just look at the guy.

1536
01:22:56.40 --> 01:22:59.28
And when they give that much weight to it, yeah.

1537
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:01.16
It's like, okay, we're going with that.

1538
01:23:01.16 --> 01:23:02.16
Yeah.

1539
01:23:02.16 --> 01:23:07.68
And what's cool is that's, that's, that's, I definitely, I definitely felt the difference

1540
01:23:07.68 --> 01:23:10.04
in my joints.

1541
01:23:10.04 --> 01:23:11.04
Yeah.

1542
01:23:11.04 --> 01:23:12.04
I don't know about my eyeballs.

1543
01:23:12.04 --> 01:23:15.04
Well, you know, although I don't see glasses at this point.

1544
01:23:15.04 --> 01:23:16.12
Yeah, there it is, proof of what that's.

1545
01:23:16.12 --> 01:23:17.52
That's, that's something.

1546
01:23:17.52 --> 01:23:18.52
Yeah.

1547
01:23:18.52 --> 01:23:19.52
It's not nothing.

1548
01:23:19.52 --> 01:23:20.52
That's for sure.

1549
01:23:20.52 --> 01:23:23.08
And the same way you, you, um, well, not in the same way.

1550
01:23:23.08 --> 01:23:27.92
But slightly similar way you had the power lift your guy, talk about Krillale.

1551
01:23:27.92 --> 01:23:31.000
My father-in-law, as I've mentioned before, told me about Krillale.

1552
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
But way better than fish oil.

1553
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.76
And you know, he's telling me, or, what was he jacked?

1555
01:23:35.76 --> 01:23:36.76
He, here's the thing.

1556
01:23:36.76 --> 01:23:37.76
He wasn't, isn't jacked.

1557
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:41.92
And here's part of the whole story, which kind of is going to kind of feed into your

1558
01:23:41.92 --> 01:23:42.92
point.

1559
01:23:42.92 --> 01:23:44.32
No, he is not jacked at all.

1560
01:23:44.32 --> 01:23:46.60
In fact, medium go left by this guy.

1561
01:23:46.60 --> 01:23:49.12
She didn't even be in the same gym with me.

1562
01:23:49.12 --> 01:23:51.52
He should be in the, the gym, maybe he's going to hear this podcast.

1563
01:23:51.52 --> 01:23:52.52
I don't care.

1564
01:23:52.52 --> 01:23:53.60
Absolutely 100%.

1565
01:23:53.60 --> 01:23:54.60
Sure.

1566
01:23:54.60 --> 01:23:57.40
Not really doing a good job building that relationship with the family.

1567
01:23:57.40 --> 01:24:00.24
At the end of the day, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, you'll see the moral.

1568
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:02.08
And I think it, well, I think it will.

1569
01:24:02.08 --> 01:24:05.16
Anyway, so no, not jacked the answer is no.

1570
01:24:05.16 --> 01:24:07.32
He can swim forever, ever.

1571
01:24:07.32 --> 01:24:09.28
In fact, he goes in Hawaii.

1572
01:24:09.28 --> 01:24:13.50
Men Maui waters with the, you know, the web hands, you know, for swimming.

1573
01:24:13.50 --> 01:24:14.50
Okay.

1574
01:24:14.50 --> 01:24:16.12
Some body bodies, you know, they're just web spongers.

1575
01:24:16.12 --> 01:24:17.12
Yeah, sure.

1576
01:24:17.12 --> 01:24:20.04
He doesn't, he's not a sponge, but he's swimmer.

1577
01:24:20.04 --> 01:24:23.24
So he'll just swim our boom, just swim it.

1578
01:24:23.24 --> 01:24:27.08
Anyway, he'd always say, you know, krill oil, all this stuff.

1579
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:28.08
But yeah, he's not jacked.

1580
01:24:28.08 --> 01:24:30.76
He doesn't lift like why he could use take krill oil.

1581
01:24:30.76 --> 01:24:32.88
And you get your XYZ results cool.

1582
01:24:32.88 --> 01:24:35.04
I don't want those XYZ results.

1583
01:24:35.04 --> 01:24:38.68
Those results that you're essentially benefiting from apparently.

1584
01:24:38.68 --> 01:24:39.68
I don't apply to my goals.

1585
01:24:39.68 --> 01:24:40.68
I don't, I don't.

1586
01:24:40.68 --> 01:24:41.68
Exactly.

1587
01:24:41.68 --> 01:24:44.36
So I'm like, okay, cool, I get it.

1588
01:24:44.36 --> 01:24:45.36
Health not.

1589
01:24:45.36 --> 01:24:46.36
He's the health not.

1590
01:24:46.36 --> 01:24:47.36
He's into health.

1591
01:24:47.36 --> 01:24:48.36
That's a positive thing.

1592
01:24:48.36 --> 01:24:50.64
There's, there is worse things to be and not about.

1593
01:24:50.64 --> 01:24:51.64
I'll tell you that.

1594
01:24:51.64 --> 01:24:52.64
Health is a good thing anyway.

1595
01:24:52.64 --> 01:24:53.64
But it's a good thing.

1596
01:24:53.64 --> 01:24:54.64
It's a little bit better to be health.

1597
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:55.64
But that's jacked.

1598
01:24:55.64 --> 01:24:58.44
I'm not going to disagree.

1599
01:24:58.44 --> 01:25:01.84
So, you know, for years, I'm like, cool, good.

1600
01:25:01.84 --> 01:25:02.84
It's rather info.

1601
01:25:02.84 --> 01:25:05.28
Yeah, then you come along and you're like, yeah, krill oil.

1602
01:25:05.28 --> 01:25:07.24
Boom, next day, I'm on the krill oil.

1603
01:25:07.24 --> 01:25:08.80
Literally next day.

1604
01:25:08.80 --> 01:25:12.48
And so, of course, he's been saying it the whole time or whatever.

1605
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:15.04
But at the end of the day, he's right.

1606
01:25:15.04 --> 01:25:16.12
He's absolutely right.

1607
01:25:16.12 --> 01:25:16.96
He was right.

1608
01:25:16.96 --> 01:25:17.96
Yeah.

1609
01:25:17.96 --> 01:25:22.96
So the normal of the story is you could be right and not jacked.

1610
01:25:22.96 --> 01:25:23.96
Yes, jacked.

1611
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:29.24
I got to kind of separate, you know, my, what he called, I got to detach.

1612
01:25:29.24 --> 01:25:30.24
This is what I got to do.

1613
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:31.24
You know, true.

1614
01:25:31.24 --> 01:25:34.92
Like, an older guy with the ability to do the things and at the health level, he's at,

1615
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:39.44
I do want for myself, regardless how much weight I can lift or can't lift.

1616
01:25:39.44 --> 01:25:40.44
That's what I want.

1617
01:25:40.44 --> 01:25:41.44
That's what I want.

1618
01:25:41.44 --> 01:25:42.44
Yeah, yeah.

1619
01:25:42.44 --> 01:25:43.44
Big time.

1620
01:25:43.44 --> 01:25:45.44
And here's the thing, I didn't think indirectly as well.

1621
01:25:45.44 --> 01:25:49.64
Because the better your joint feels special is you get older, but just in life, regardless

1622
01:25:49.64 --> 01:25:52.88
how old you're, the better your joints are functioning, the more you're going to be

1623
01:25:52.88 --> 01:26:00.52
able to lift or mounting climb or right bike or compete in baggling.

1624
01:26:00.52 --> 01:26:01.52
Midden.

1625
01:26:01.52 --> 01:26:02.52
Bad midden.

1626
01:26:02.52 --> 01:26:03.52
How do you say that?

1627
01:26:03.52 --> 01:26:04.52
Bad midden.

1628
01:26:04.52 --> 01:26:05.52
Yeah, competing that.

1629
01:26:05.52 --> 01:26:06.52
That's true.

1630
01:26:06.52 --> 01:26:07.52
Bad.

1631
01:26:07.52 --> 01:26:11.96
You don't need tennis or bad midden elbow, you know, for, you know, I,

1632
01:26:11.96 --> 01:26:16.40
I, I, I, I, I, I.

1633
01:26:16.40 --> 01:26:18.40
That's the one, I'll make it three.

1634
01:26:18.40 --> 01:26:20.000
And then you have discipline, right.

1635
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.46
And that's for your brain memory, how many things.

1636
01:26:22.46 --> 01:26:24.20
So they play into each other, is you're insane.

1637
01:26:24.20 --> 01:26:25.04
So the joint warfare has the brain stuff and the joint stuff.

1638
01:26:25.04 --> 01:26:26.04
Crilt oil has the joint stuff.

1639
01:26:26.04 --> 01:26:27.12
Really good day at your Jitsu the other day.

1640
01:26:27.12 --> 01:26:30.12
And I was talking to Dave Burke on my way home from Jitsu.

1641
01:26:30.12 --> 01:26:31.12
Good deal, dude.

1642
01:26:31.12 --> 01:26:32.12
Yeah, good deal, Dave.

1643
01:26:32.12 --> 01:26:35.72
And I was like, you know, you said only I trained today.

1644
01:26:35.72 --> 01:26:39.60
I was like, I had a really good day at that.

1645
01:26:39.60 --> 01:26:40.60
So he's like, what does that mean?

1646
01:26:40.60 --> 01:26:44.16
I'll just mean, you know, like, just getting after just.

1647
01:26:44.16 --> 01:26:49.32
And I realized that the past anyways, I realized that I've been taking like three

1648
01:26:49.32 --> 01:26:50.32
scoops of discipline.

1649
01:26:50.32 --> 01:26:51.32
I'm not going to try.

1650
01:26:51.32 --> 01:26:52.32
Oh, okay.

1651
01:26:52.32 --> 01:26:53.32
Oh, is that illegal?

1652
01:26:53.32 --> 01:26:58.36
Yeah, well, you know, I, you know, you may be, it could be it should be maybe, yeah.

1653
01:26:58.36 --> 01:27:00.96
Well, you depends on what you mean by fair.

1654
01:27:00.96 --> 01:27:03.80
Because if you're going into compete with your training partners, which you do from

1655
01:27:03.80 --> 01:27:05.60
time to time, let's face it.

1656
01:27:05.60 --> 01:27:07.60
And yeah, it's a little bit of an advantage.

1657
01:27:07.60 --> 01:27:08.60
Yeah, fair.

1658
01:27:08.60 --> 01:27:09.60
No, it's ashes.

1659
01:27:09.60 --> 01:27:10.60
It's ashes, fair.

1660
01:27:10.60 --> 01:27:16.28
Andy, or wherever you go into training with, D, me, we could take three things

1661
01:27:16.28 --> 01:27:17.28
that discipline.

1662
01:27:17.28 --> 01:27:18.28
If you wanted to.

1663
01:27:18.28 --> 01:27:19.28
One or two, it's fair.

1664
01:27:19.28 --> 01:27:20.28
It's fair.

1665
01:27:20.28 --> 01:27:22.08
In fact, I recommend take three things at discipline.

1666
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:23.08
Boom.

1667
01:27:23.08 --> 01:27:24.08
There it is.

1668
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:25.08
Dislink.

1669
01:27:25.08 --> 01:27:26.08
Cognitive enhancing.

1670
01:27:26.08 --> 01:27:27.60
So they all play with each other.

1671
01:27:27.60 --> 01:27:28.60
That's important.

1672
01:27:28.60 --> 01:27:29.60
Very important.

1673
01:27:29.60 --> 01:27:31.60
I think.

1674
01:27:31.60 --> 01:27:34.60
Regardless how much you can live.

1675
01:27:34.60 --> 01:27:35.60
Yeah, check.

1676
01:27:35.60 --> 01:27:37.60
Also, milk.

1677
01:27:37.60 --> 01:27:40.60
What is milk?

1678
01:27:40.60 --> 01:27:43.20
Who is someone who's just asking about milk?

1679
01:27:43.20 --> 01:27:46.84
And the best thing about when people ask you what milk is is you get it.

1680
01:27:46.84 --> 01:27:48.84
You get a chance to do the routine.

1681
01:27:48.84 --> 01:27:49.84
Right?

1682
01:27:49.84 --> 01:27:51.36
You get a chance to do the routine.

1683
01:27:51.36 --> 01:27:53.36
Well, someone's like, no, what's milk?

1684
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:54.36
What's milk?

1685
01:27:54.36 --> 01:27:55.36
What's milk?

1686
01:27:55.36 --> 01:27:56.36
Yeah.

1687
01:27:56.36 --> 01:27:58.32
You get to do the routine, which is what's milk?

1688
01:27:58.32 --> 01:27:59.32
Oh, it's milk.

1689
01:27:59.32 --> 01:28:00.32
That's the routine.

1690
01:28:00.32 --> 01:28:01.32
That's the routine.

1691
01:28:01.32 --> 01:28:02.32
You remember what is it?

1692
01:28:02.32 --> 01:28:03.32
It's milk.

1693
01:28:03.32 --> 01:28:04.32
No, it's milk.

1694
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:05.32
You want some kind of explanation.

1695
01:28:05.32 --> 01:28:06.32
You're like, no, no.

1696
01:28:06.32 --> 01:28:07.32
It's milk.

1697
01:28:07.32 --> 01:28:08.32
Yeah, yeah.

1698
01:28:08.32 --> 01:28:09.32
Common sense.

1699
01:28:09.32 --> 01:28:10.32
Really?

1700
01:28:10.32 --> 01:28:11.32
How do you say that?

1701
01:28:11.32 --> 01:28:13.32
You just take common sense from there and boom, clear.

1702
01:28:13.32 --> 01:28:14.32
Yeah.

1703
01:28:14.32 --> 01:28:16.32
That's my goal.

1704
01:28:16.32 --> 01:28:20.32
My goal is that it ends up in the Oxford English dictionary.

1705
01:28:20.32 --> 01:28:21.32
Yeah.

1706
01:28:21.32 --> 01:28:22.32
Like zerox.

1707
01:28:22.32 --> 01:28:24.32
And then if someone doesn't know what it is, they can just go look it up.

1708
01:28:24.32 --> 01:28:25.32
Yeah, look it up.

1709
01:28:25.32 --> 01:28:26.32
That's in the dictionary by the way.

1710
01:28:26.32 --> 01:28:27.32
Yeah.

1711
01:28:27.32 --> 01:28:28.32
That's my goal.

1712
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:29.32
Like Google is Google in there for like, yes.

1713
01:28:29.32 --> 01:28:30.32
Yes.

1714
01:28:30.32 --> 01:28:31.32
It's a girl living in a room.

1715
01:28:31.32 --> 01:28:32.32
Go Google that.

1716
01:28:32.32 --> 01:28:33.32
Yeah.

1717
01:28:33.32 --> 01:28:34.32
So Google.

1718
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:35.32
So Google.

1719
01:28:35.32 --> 01:28:35.32
Yeah.

1720
01:28:35.32 --> 01:28:36.32
Yeah.

1721
01:28:36.32 --> 01:28:37.32
There.

1722
01:28:37.32 --> 01:28:38.32
You'll find it.

1723
01:28:38.32 --> 01:28:39.32
Yes.

1724
01:28:39.32 --> 01:28:40.32
You'll know what it is.

1725
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:41.32
Well, you'll know that it's tasty.

1726
01:28:41.32 --> 01:28:46.96
The guy that said, hey, I don't use protein powders.

1727
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:48.76
But does it taste that good?

1728
01:28:48.76 --> 01:28:50.76
I should just get it anyways.

1729
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:52.76
My answer was 100% resounding.

1730
01:28:52.76 --> 01:28:53.76
Absolutely.

1731
01:28:53.76 --> 01:28:54.76
Yeah.

1732
01:28:54.76 --> 01:28:56.76
You just want to have a really good dessert.

1733
01:28:56.76 --> 01:28:57.76
Yeah.

1734
01:28:57.76 --> 01:28:58.76
Peanut butter is coming.

1735
01:28:58.76 --> 01:29:06.28
So Dave Burke is on the path to order all the peanut butter.

1736
01:29:06.28 --> 01:29:07.28
They're chocolate anyways.

1737
01:29:07.28 --> 01:29:08.28
Oh, the whole supply.

1738
01:29:08.28 --> 01:29:09.28
Yeah.

1739
01:29:09.28 --> 01:29:10.28
You want to also supply.

1740
01:29:10.28 --> 01:29:11.28
Not a bad idea.

1741
01:29:11.28 --> 01:29:12.28
Yeah.

1742
01:29:12.28 --> 01:29:13.28
Yeah.

1743
01:29:13.28 --> 01:29:14.28
So yeah.

1744
01:29:14.28 --> 01:29:15.28
If you don't know, molek look.

1745
01:29:15.28 --> 01:29:17.28
I'm going to violate some terminology scenarios here.

1746
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:19.28
Molek is protein powder.

1747
01:29:19.28 --> 01:29:21.28
It's actually molek.

1748
01:29:21.28 --> 01:29:22.28
Yeah, man.

1749
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:24.28
The best protein powder.

1750
01:29:24.28 --> 01:29:26.28
That tastes like a dessert straight up does though.

1751
01:29:26.28 --> 01:29:28.28
Not just claims and doesn't.

1752
01:29:28.28 --> 01:29:30.28
It does straight up.

1753
01:29:30.28 --> 01:29:31.28
Literally.

1754
01:29:31.28 --> 01:29:33.28
And we will have molek at the immersion camp.

1755
01:29:33.28 --> 01:29:35.28
This summer up in Maine.

1756
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:39.28
Echo Lake layers August 26th through September 2nd.

1757
01:29:39.28 --> 01:29:40.28
Two sessions come up there.

1758
01:29:40.28 --> 01:29:41.28
I'll be there.

1759
01:29:41.28 --> 01:29:43.28
Lave will be there.

1760
01:29:43.28 --> 01:29:44.28
Echo Charles will be there.

1761
01:29:44.28 --> 01:29:46.28
And apparently you say you will be rolling.

1762
01:29:46.28 --> 01:29:47.28
Yeah, limited.

1763
01:29:47.28 --> 01:29:48.28
Okay.

1764
01:29:48.28 --> 01:29:51.28
Limited rolling from from which sounds like pre-determined excuses.

1765
01:29:51.28 --> 01:29:52.28
Which is fine.

1766
01:29:52.28 --> 01:29:53.28
Yeah.

1767
01:29:53.28 --> 01:29:54.28
Well, here.

1768
01:29:54.28 --> 01:29:55.28
Okay.

1769
01:29:55.28 --> 01:29:56.28
All right.

1770
01:29:56.28 --> 01:29:56.28
We'll let him lay it out then.

1771
01:29:56.28 --> 01:29:57.28
Playboy.

1772
01:29:57.28 --> 01:29:58.28
The.

1773
01:29:58.28 --> 01:29:59.28
The ghee.

1774
01:29:59.28 --> 01:30:01.28
I'll be doing less of because ghee has a lot of

1775
01:30:01.28 --> 01:30:06.28
sugar.

1776
01:30:06.28 --> 01:30:07.28
So pulling.

1777
01:30:07.28 --> 01:30:08.28
I'm really.

1778
01:30:08.28 --> 01:30:09.28
I'm out of pulling.

1779
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:10.28
I can't do pulling.

1780
01:30:10.28 --> 01:30:11.28
Very limited.

1781
01:30:11.28 --> 01:30:12.28
Maybe with one hand.

1782
01:30:12.28 --> 01:30:13.28
So I'll do ghee.

1783
01:30:13.28 --> 01:30:14.28
But it's like, okay.

1784
01:30:14.28 --> 01:30:15.28
Now I'm rolling literally with one hand.

1785
01:30:15.28 --> 01:30:16.28
By the way, ghee.

1786
01:30:16.28 --> 01:30:17.28
We'll be there.

1787
01:30:17.28 --> 01:30:18.28
Yeah.

1788
01:30:18.28 --> 01:30:19.28
Dean Lister will be there.

1789
01:30:19.28 --> 01:30:20.28
And if you want to learn from someone, he is one of the top people.

1790
01:30:20.28 --> 01:30:21.28
In the world to learn from.

1791
01:30:21.28 --> 01:30:22.28
And I know that's a bold statement.

1792
01:30:22.28 --> 01:30:23.28
Yeah.

1793
01:30:23.28 --> 01:30:24.28
I know it is.

1794
01:30:24.28 --> 01:30:29.28
He's got a mind that understands not only the mechanics.

1795
01:30:29.28 --> 01:30:33.28
And the concepts of the jitsu.

1796
01:30:33.28 --> 01:30:34.28
Added at it.

1797
01:30:34.28 --> 01:30:37.28
But one of the highest levels of anyone ever recomunicated with.

1798
01:30:37.28 --> 01:30:41.28
But also knows how to express those concepts in a very clear way.

1799
01:30:41.28 --> 01:30:44.28
So immersion camp.

1800
01:30:44.28 --> 01:30:46.28
August 26 through September 2nd.

1801
01:30:46.28 --> 01:30:48.28
Go and come up there.

1802
01:30:48.28 --> 01:30:49.28
We'll see you up there.

1803
01:30:49.28 --> 01:30:50.28
Good places.

1804
01:30:50.28 --> 01:30:51.28
And we will have more.

1805
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:52.28
Yes.

1806
01:30:52.28 --> 01:30:53.28
Lots of it.

1807
01:30:53.28 --> 01:30:57.28
And Dean's good at kind of taking the concept and really clarifying the concept.

1808
01:30:57.28 --> 01:30:59.28
Even separate from the actor.

1809
01:30:59.28 --> 01:31:00.28
I mean, the moves always attach.

1810
01:31:00.28 --> 01:31:06.28
But Dean says things sometimes that I run over and take a little note on my phone.

1811
01:31:06.28 --> 01:31:07.28
Yeah.

1812
01:31:07.28 --> 01:31:08.28
Yeah.

1813
01:31:08.28 --> 01:31:09.28
I'm going to call it.

1814
01:31:09.28 --> 01:31:10.28
That's a good one.

1815
01:31:10.28 --> 01:31:13.28
Usually I'm thinking I'm going to when he comes on the podcast.

1816
01:31:13.28 --> 01:31:15.28
I'm going to talk about those things.

1817
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:17.28
So I hope you know, mum.

1818
01:31:17.28 --> 01:31:20.28
Also, good way to support is the fact.

1819
01:31:20.28 --> 01:31:22.28
We're on top of the fact.

1820
01:31:22.28 --> 01:31:25.28
Where is part of the fact that chocolate is on store?

1821
01:31:25.28 --> 01:31:27.28
It's called jocquistore.

1822
01:31:27.28 --> 01:31:30.28
It's going to jocquistore.com for these items.

1823
01:31:30.28 --> 01:31:32.28
It's where you can get rash cards.

1824
01:31:32.28 --> 01:31:33.28
You can definitely get rash cards.

1825
01:31:33.28 --> 01:31:34.28
Yes.

1826
01:31:34.28 --> 01:31:35.28
Get after it.

1827
01:31:35.28 --> 01:31:37.28
T-shirts.

1828
01:31:37.28 --> 01:31:38.28
A bunch of t-shirts.

1829
01:31:38.28 --> 01:31:39.28
Yeah.

1830
01:31:39.28 --> 01:31:40.28
They want to say discipline equals freedom.

1831
01:31:40.28 --> 01:31:41.28
New t-shirt coming.

1832
01:31:41.28 --> 01:31:44.28
New t-shirts are coming.

1833
01:31:44.28 --> 01:31:45.28
Oh t-shirts with pearls.

1834
01:31:45.28 --> 01:31:46.28
Yeah.

1835
01:31:46.28 --> 01:31:47.28
Oh dang.

1836
01:31:47.28 --> 01:31:48.28
Two of them.

1837
01:31:48.28 --> 01:31:49.28
If, yeah.

1838
01:31:49.28 --> 01:31:51.28
If you're interested in the t-shirts,

1839
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:52.28
they want to say discipline equals freedom.

1840
01:31:52.28 --> 01:31:53.28
It's a good one.

1841
01:31:53.28 --> 01:32:02.28
I get revealed how deep the expression discipline equals freedom goes.

1842
01:32:02.28 --> 01:32:04.28
Like almost date and that not daily.

1843
01:32:04.28 --> 01:32:08.28
But let's say once you understand it at a deep level,

1844
01:32:08.28 --> 01:32:10.28
deeper and less present it to reveal to you how important it is.

1845
01:32:10.28 --> 01:32:11.28
Yes.

1846
01:32:11.28 --> 01:32:14.28
How much even more than I proved for previously thought the week before.

1847
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:17.28
It's almost like it has no limit to the layers.

1848
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:18.28
It's pretty important.

1849
01:32:18.28 --> 01:32:19.28
Yeah.

1850
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:24.28
Actually, I've been sporting the discipline equals freedom.

1851
01:32:24.28 --> 01:32:27.28
The trucker hat.

1852
01:32:27.28 --> 01:32:32.28
So, and I also have the deaf beanie.

1853
01:32:32.28 --> 01:32:33.28
Yes.

1854
01:32:33.28 --> 01:32:33.28
Yeah.

1855
01:32:33.28 --> 01:32:34.28
That's a good one.

1856
01:32:34.28 --> 01:32:35.28
So you got that.

1857
01:32:35.28 --> 01:32:36.28
That was available.

1858
01:32:36.28 --> 01:32:37.28
Check.

1859
01:32:37.28 --> 01:32:38.28
Yep.

1860
01:32:38.28 --> 01:32:39.28
Yes.

1861
01:32:39.28 --> 01:32:41.28
And also, hoodies.

1862
01:32:41.28 --> 01:32:43.28
Heavy hoodies.

1863
01:32:43.28 --> 01:32:44.28
And light noodies.

1864
01:32:44.28 --> 01:32:45.28
I know, I know, I know.

1865
01:32:45.28 --> 01:32:48.28
But I have been getting feedback

1866
01:32:48.28 --> 01:32:53.28
online and offline, by the way, for the light hoodie.

1867
01:32:53.28 --> 01:32:55.28
People just love them.

1868
01:32:55.28 --> 01:32:57.28
They want the light hoodie man.

1869
01:32:57.28 --> 01:33:00.28
They want to represent, you know, like I said.

1870
01:33:00.28 --> 01:33:01.28
That's a Hawaii.

1871
01:33:01.28 --> 01:33:02.28
I'm telling you.

1872
01:33:02.28 --> 01:33:03.28
There are times.

1873
01:33:03.28 --> 01:33:04.28
All your friends.

1874
01:33:04.28 --> 01:33:05.28
They're Hawaii.

1875
01:33:05.28 --> 01:33:06.28
All them, everybody.

1876
01:33:06.28 --> 01:33:09.28
And all the ohan and Hawaii's hit me up.

1877
01:33:09.28 --> 01:33:10.28
Become a Ina.

1878
01:33:10.28 --> 01:33:11.28
All them.

1879
01:33:11.28 --> 01:33:12.28
Yes.

1880
01:33:12.28 --> 01:33:14.28
And because in Hawaii and other places here,

1881
01:33:14.28 --> 01:33:15.28
let's face it.

1882
01:33:15.28 --> 01:33:16.28
There are times where it's like, hey,

1883
01:33:16.28 --> 01:33:18.28
like yesterday was one of them.

1884
01:33:18.28 --> 01:33:21.28
It's like, bro, it's kind of cold.

1885
01:33:21.28 --> 01:33:22.28
But it's not cold.

1886
01:33:22.28 --> 01:33:23.28
It's kind of cold.

1887
01:33:23.28 --> 01:33:26.28
If you were a t-shirt, it's like, man, this environment.

1888
01:33:26.28 --> 01:33:30.28
Whether is offering.

1889
01:33:30.28 --> 01:33:31.28
It's not offering.

1890
01:33:31.28 --> 01:33:32.28
Not feed.

1891
01:33:32.28 --> 01:33:33.28
No, go dev.

1892
01:33:33.28 --> 01:33:35.28
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1893
01:33:35.28 --> 01:33:36.28
Negative.

1894
01:33:36.28 --> 01:33:37.28
Nope.

1895
01:33:37.28 --> 01:33:38.28
That's not to me,

1896
01:33:38.28 --> 01:33:41.28
especially if you're at like a little gathering.

1897
01:33:41.28 --> 01:33:42.28
Social.

1898
01:33:42.28 --> 01:33:46.28
Social.

1899
01:33:46.28 --> 01:33:47.28
It's a situation.

1900
01:33:47.28 --> 01:33:48.28
It's maybe.

1901
01:33:48.28 --> 01:33:50.28
It could be looked at as paramount.

1902
01:33:50.28 --> 01:33:51.28
But here's what it is.

1903
01:33:51.28 --> 01:33:54.28
If the if the weather, whatever,

1904
01:33:54.28 --> 01:33:57.28
environment is offering slight discomfort.

1905
01:33:57.28 --> 01:33:58.28
You know, you have a right.

1906
01:33:58.28 --> 01:34:00.28
You know, I'm laughing so hard right now.

1907
01:34:00.28 --> 01:34:04.28
Because everything you're saying is things that I wouldn't allow myself or anyone of my

1908
01:34:04.28 --> 01:34:05.28
immediate family to say.

1909
01:34:05.28 --> 01:34:07.28
It doesn't make it.

1910
01:34:07.28 --> 01:34:08.28
It doesn't make it anymore true.

1911
01:34:08.28 --> 01:34:09.28
That's the thing.

1912
01:34:09.28 --> 01:34:11.28
So hey, look, I mean, you're cruising.

1913
01:34:11.28 --> 01:34:12.28
Right outside.

1914
01:34:12.28 --> 01:34:13.28
Maybe not you.

1915
01:34:13.28 --> 01:34:14.28
I can't.

1916
01:34:14.28 --> 01:34:15.28
If me and their, I don't think you did it.

1917
01:34:15.28 --> 01:34:16.28
I don't think you do.

1918
01:34:16.28 --> 01:34:17.28
That's the thing.

1919
01:34:17.28 --> 01:34:19.28
If me and Dave work were cruising.

1920
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:20.28
Oh, maybe he'd want them on.

1921
01:34:20.28 --> 01:34:24.28
And yeah, it's like it just maybe three degrees too cold.

1922
01:34:24.28 --> 01:34:26.28
Yeah, you can suck it up.

1923
01:34:26.28 --> 01:34:27.28
But what?

1924
01:34:27.28 --> 01:34:30.28
Why you got to endure discomfort at times when it's not necessary?

1925
01:34:30.28 --> 01:34:33.28
Unless you're exercising your tolerance for discomfort.

1926
01:34:33.28 --> 01:34:34.28
You should be.

1927
01:34:34.28 --> 01:34:35.28
Which you should add all point at all times.

1928
01:34:35.28 --> 01:34:36.28
That's what you're saying.

1929
01:34:36.28 --> 01:34:37.28
Affirmative.

1930
01:34:37.28 --> 01:34:38.28
No, okay.

1931
01:34:38.28 --> 01:34:39.28
Me and Dave, we don't agree with this.

1932
01:34:39.28 --> 01:34:44.28
So you put on a regular hoodie or heavy or even a medium hoodie after what?

1933
01:34:44.28 --> 01:34:46.28
Five minutes, six minutes.

1934
01:34:46.28 --> 01:34:50.28
We worked out earlier today, whatever that he is too hot.

1935
01:34:50.28 --> 01:34:51.28
So thick hoodie too hot.

1936
01:34:51.28 --> 01:34:53.28
No hoodie too cold.

1937
01:34:53.28 --> 01:34:56.28
Boom, light hoodie perfect.

1938
01:34:56.28 --> 01:34:58.28
Because you don't know about that perfection.

1939
01:34:58.28 --> 01:35:00.28
You know, that caught me, man.

1940
01:35:00.28 --> 01:35:02.28
You know, this own balance, this own.

1941
01:35:02.28 --> 01:35:03.28
Anyway, light hoodie.

1942
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:05.28
This one equals freedom.

1943
01:35:05.28 --> 01:35:07.28
That's the freedom part.

1944
01:35:07.28 --> 01:35:08.28
Boom.

1945
01:35:08.28 --> 01:35:09.28
Women's stuff as well.

1946
01:35:09.28 --> 01:35:15.28
By the way, women's t-shirts specifically for the ladies.

1947
01:35:15.28 --> 01:35:16.28
And tank tops.

1948
01:35:16.28 --> 01:35:17.28
Boom.

1949
01:35:17.28 --> 01:35:18.28
Rosh guards are kind of for everybody.

1950
01:35:18.28 --> 01:35:19.28

01:35:51.28 --> 01:35:52.28
Cool.

1968
01:35:52.28 --> 01:35:53.28
A great disagree.

1969
01:35:53.28 --> 01:35:54.28
Yeah.

1970
01:35:54.28 --> 01:35:55.28
Sure.

1971
01:35:55.28 --> 01:35:56.28
That's not a good one.

1972
01:35:56.28 --> 01:35:57.28
Put you on the spot to not be humble.

1973
01:35:57.28 --> 01:35:58.28
So I won't do that.

1974
01:35:58.28 --> 01:36:01.28
Echo makes good videos.

1976
01:36:03.28 --> 01:36:05.28

subscriberable.

1982
01:36:12.28 --> 01:36:13.28
Mm-hmm.

1983
01:36:13.28 --> 01:36:14.28
You know, yeah.

1984
01:36:14.28 --> 01:36:15.28
Good way to support for sure.

1985
01:36:15.28 --> 01:36:17.28
Also some excerpts on there.

1986
01:36:17.28 --> 01:36:20.28
You know, little lessons from this podcast directly.

1987
01:36:20.28 --> 01:36:21.28
Mm-hmm.

1988
01:36:21.28 --> 01:36:23.28
And you know, so sometimes you don't want to listen to,

1989
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:26.28
let's say you listen to podcast number 100,

1990
01:36:26.28 --> 01:36:27.28
one.

1991
01:36:27.28 --> 01:36:29.28
And you're like, hey, there's some good stuff in there.

1992
01:36:29.28 --> 01:36:31.28
But should I listen to the whole,

1993
01:36:31.28 --> 01:36:33.28
you know, how many hours of the podcast for that one lesson?

1994
01:36:33.28 --> 01:36:35.28
One lesson that I want to kind of revisit?

1995
01:36:35.28 --> 01:36:37.28
Should you do that?

1996
01:36:37.28 --> 01:36:38.28
Mm-hmm.

1997
01:36:38.28 --> 01:36:39.28
Some of us don't have that kind of time.

1998
01:36:39.28 --> 01:36:41.28
So I'm going to put out some excerpts from all the podcasts.

1999
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:42.28
Most of them.

2000
01:36:42.28 --> 01:36:43.28
So yeah, go on there, subscribe.

2001
01:36:43.28 --> 01:36:44.28
Get a little alert.

2002
01:36:44.28 --> 01:36:46.28
And we put one up.

2003
01:36:46.28 --> 01:36:47.28
That's the one you want to listen to.

2004
01:36:47.28 --> 01:36:48.28
Boom, listen to it.

2005
01:36:48.28 --> 01:36:49.28
Good way to support.

2006
01:36:49.28 --> 01:36:50.28
By the way.

2007
01:36:50.28 --> 01:36:51.28
Also.

2008
01:36:51.28 --> 01:36:53.28
On it.

2009
01:36:53.28 --> 01:36:55.28
On it.com slash chocolate.

2010
01:36:55.28 --> 01:36:58.28
This is where I get all my kettlebells.

2011
01:36:58.28 --> 01:37:00.28
I won't say all my socks, but a lot of socks.

2012
01:37:00.28 --> 01:37:01.28
That's where I get them from.

2013
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:02.28
I know, sounds weird.

2014
01:37:02.28 --> 01:37:04.28
But man, some of those things.

2015
01:37:04.28 --> 01:37:06.28
Sometimes you appreciate the socks you're wearing,

2016
01:37:06.28 --> 01:37:08.28
especially when you're going through the airport.

2017
01:37:08.28 --> 01:37:09.28
TSA, boom, you gotta take off your shoes.

2018
01:37:09.28 --> 01:37:11.28
Boom, hit them with the on it socks.

2019
01:37:11.28 --> 01:37:14.28
Anyway, fitness gear mainly.

2020
01:37:14.28 --> 01:37:15.28
I think that's what I go.

2021
01:37:15.28 --> 01:37:17.28
And for the information too.

2022
01:37:17.28 --> 01:37:18.28
By the way, like kettlebells.

2023
01:37:18.28 --> 01:37:19.28
What I started kettlebells?

2024
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:20.28
I heard good things.

2025
01:37:20.28 --> 01:37:22.28
You know, start the kettlebells.

2026
01:37:22.28 --> 01:37:24.28
They're kind of, they're intimidating.

2027
01:37:24.28 --> 01:37:26.28
So boom, going on it.

2028
01:37:26.28 --> 01:37:27.28
.com.

2029
01:37:27.28 --> 01:37:28.28
They have all the info on there.

2030
01:37:28.28 --> 01:37:30.28
Little things about form.

2031
01:37:30.28 --> 01:37:31.28
Little workouts.

2032
01:37:31.28 --> 01:37:32.28
Really good.

2033
01:37:32.28 --> 01:37:33.28
Good on maces too.

2034
01:37:33.28 --> 01:37:35.28
Are they called battle maces?

2035
01:37:35.28 --> 01:37:36.28
Just maces.

2036
01:37:36.28 --> 01:37:40.28
They're steel sticks.

2037
01:37:40.28 --> 01:37:41.28
Clubs.

2038
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:44.28
Clubs that look like the juggling clubs.

2039
01:37:44.28 --> 01:37:45.28
Yeah.

2040
01:37:45.28 --> 01:37:46.28
But they have one thing there.

2041
01:37:46.28 --> 01:37:47.28
You can't juggle.

2042
01:37:47.28 --> 01:37:48.28
That's the thing.

2043
01:37:48.28 --> 01:37:51.28
If you could juggle those, you'd be a, you'd be a complete badass.

2044
01:37:51.28 --> 01:37:53.28
If you'd juggle those 20 pounders.

2045
01:37:53.28 --> 01:37:54.28
They're freaking heavy.

2046
01:37:54.28 --> 01:37:55.28
Yeah.

2047
01:37:55.28 --> 01:37:58.28
And they're heavier than they sound when you say 20 pounds.

2048
01:37:58.28 --> 01:37:59.28
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2049
01:37:59.28 --> 01:38:00.28
It's all the time.

2050
01:38:00.28 --> 01:38:01.28
It's all the time.

2051
01:38:01.28 --> 01:38:02.28
They're heavy.

2052
01:38:02.28 --> 01:38:04.28
The only way they're 20 pounds.

2053
01:38:04.28 --> 01:38:08.28
The only way they're even, they can even justify saying 20 pounds is when you actually

2054
01:38:08.28 --> 01:38:10.28
put them on the scale and the number of happens.

2055
01:38:10.28 --> 01:38:11.28
Because it's the same 20.

2056
01:38:11.28 --> 01:38:12.28
Otherwise, it's not 20.

2057
01:38:12.28 --> 01:38:16.28
You think they were not made out of metal, but some, you know, something from outer space.

2058
01:38:16.28 --> 01:38:20.28
If you brought them to the airport and you know when you're checking in, you know, and you put the

2059
01:38:20.28 --> 01:38:25.28
your luggage on the scale and you know you were pushing it, you know that it may be over 50 pounds

2060
01:38:25.28 --> 01:38:26.28
and you're like nervous.

2061
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:27.28
Right.

2062
01:38:27.28 --> 01:38:32.28
And then it doesn't hit 50 pounds.

2063
01:38:32.28 --> 01:38:34.28
If you got that mace, you have that mace in your hand.

2064
01:38:34.28 --> 01:38:35.28
You're about to put that on the scale.

2065
01:38:35.28 --> 01:38:37.28
You know, you know, this is going over.

2066
01:38:37.28 --> 01:38:40.28
I'm paying that extra overage of feet.

2067
01:38:40.28 --> 01:38:41.28
That's what it feels like.

2068
01:38:41.28 --> 01:38:43.28
It's as far as the mace goes.

2069
01:38:43.28 --> 01:38:45.28
Anyway, happens to be a good thing to work out with.

2070
01:38:45.28 --> 01:38:46.28
But you grabbed that thing.

2071
01:38:46.28 --> 01:38:48.28
You're me like, okay, what kind of workout I'm going to do this?

2072
01:38:48.28 --> 01:38:49.28
Boom on it.

2073
01:38:49.28 --> 01:38:50.28
Talk com slash drucko.

2074
01:38:50.28 --> 01:38:51.28
Look up the workout.

2075
01:38:51.28 --> 01:38:52.28
You got it.

2076
01:38:52.28 --> 01:38:54.28
Also psychological warfare.

2077
01:38:54.28 --> 01:38:56.28
It's an album that has various tracks on it that you can.

2078
01:38:56.28 --> 01:39:01.28
Play to push you through moments of weakness.

2079
01:39:01.28 --> 01:39:07.28
And we are we are formulating psychological warfare to all your excuses are lies.

2080
01:39:07.28 --> 01:39:08.28
Yes.

2081
01:39:08.28 --> 01:39:10.28
Working time working time working time.

2082
01:39:10.28 --> 01:39:12.28
But it's pretty good title.

2083
01:39:12.28 --> 01:39:14.28
Also, juggle like tea.

2084
01:39:14.28 --> 01:39:15.28
There's a thing.

2085
01:39:15.28 --> 01:39:16.28
I'm a tea drinker now.

2086
01:39:16.28 --> 01:39:18.28
I don't know if you know that.

2087
01:39:18.28 --> 01:39:19.28
I'm a tea drinker now.

2088
01:39:19.28 --> 01:39:20.28
I drink tea regularly.

2089
01:39:20.28 --> 01:39:22.28
I think that's kind of all it takes really.

2090
01:39:22.28 --> 01:39:24.28
But.

2091
01:39:24.28 --> 01:39:36.28
There was a whole thing when I didn't realize I didn't know that tea drinker had like some stereotypical thing behind it.

2092
01:39:36.28 --> 01:39:36.28
Yeah, yeah.

2093
01:39:36.28 --> 01:39:39.28
So when I get on this schema, white tea people are, that's really weird.

2094
01:39:39.28 --> 01:39:42.28
But you'd make tea because they think I'd I'd be making.

2095
01:39:42.28 --> 01:39:43.28
What a work.

2096
01:39:43.28 --> 01:39:44.28
Malk.

2097
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:45.28
Yeah.

2098
01:39:45.28 --> 01:39:45.28
Yeah.

2099
01:39:45.28 --> 01:39:48.28
They think I'd make more, but they wouldn't think I'd strike me as a tea drinker.

2100
01:39:48.28 --> 01:39:50.28
I didn't realize that.

2101
01:39:50.28 --> 01:39:53.28
So I guess we're changing the paradigm and those stereotypes will not be.

2102
01:39:53.28 --> 01:39:56.28
Well, not be expecting you didn't accept it anymore.

2103
01:39:56.28 --> 01:39:57.28
Oh, agreed.

2104
01:39:57.28 --> 01:39:58.28
I drink tea and I'm proud.

2105
01:39:58.28 --> 01:40:02.28
Maybe you're changing you're just evolving this stereotype.

2106
01:40:02.28 --> 01:40:03.28
Maybe because you are a tea drinker.

2107
01:40:03.28 --> 01:40:04.28
I'll straighten up.

2108
01:40:04.28 --> 01:40:06.28
I've been drinking tea since day one.

2109
01:40:06.28 --> 01:40:08.28
Not really since day one, but since I figured out.

2110
01:40:08.28 --> 01:40:09.28
Day two.

2111
01:40:09.28 --> 01:40:10.28
Yeah.

2112
01:40:10.28 --> 01:40:11.28
Day two.

2113
01:40:11.28 --> 01:40:12.28
There you go.

2114
01:40:12.28 --> 01:40:13.28
Boom.

2115
01:40:13.28 --> 01:40:14.28
Yeah.

2116
01:40:14.28 --> 01:40:17.28
So juggle white tea, pomegranate, all organic certified by the way.

2117
01:40:17.28 --> 01:40:20.28
Because you know, juggle cares about that kind of stuff.

2118
01:40:20.28 --> 01:40:22.28
In the bags and in the can.

2119
01:40:22.28 --> 01:40:23.28
Big deal.

2120
01:40:23.28 --> 01:40:25.28
And the most tea drinkers care about certified organic.

2121
01:40:25.28 --> 01:40:26.28
Yeah, like it.

2122
01:40:26.28 --> 01:40:27.28
That's another stereotype.

2123
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:28.28
So GMO tea.

2124
01:40:28.28 --> 01:40:29.28
No good.

2125
01:40:29.28 --> 01:40:30.28
No good.

2126
01:40:30.28 --> 01:40:31.28
We don't have that.

2127
01:40:31.28 --> 01:40:32.28
We'll not put that in my body.

2128
01:40:32.28 --> 01:40:34.28
Yeah, you're right.

2129
01:40:34.28 --> 01:40:35.28
Agreed.

2130
01:40:35.28 --> 01:40:36.28
You get it on Amazon.

2131
01:40:36.28 --> 01:40:37.28
Yeah.

2132
01:40:37.28 --> 01:40:39.28
In fact, I think that's the only place you can get it.

2133
01:40:39.28 --> 01:40:41.28
Well, it is the only place you can get it right now.

2134
01:40:41.28 --> 01:40:45.28
And important fact, there's dry white tea that you put in a brew.

2135
01:40:45.28 --> 01:40:49.28
And then there's the new thing, which is in a can.

2136
01:40:49.28 --> 01:40:50.28
Yeah.

2137
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:55.04
And the thing that's fired up right now is people that are replacing the 12 or not

2138
01:40:55.04 --> 01:40:59.12
the 12, but they're replacing the four energy drinks.

2139
01:40:59.12 --> 01:41:00.12
Yeah.

2140
01:41:00.12 --> 01:41:01.12
Which actually give you no energy.

2141
01:41:01.12 --> 01:41:07.28
They actually sap your energy and crush your soul and turn you into a health disaster.

2142
01:41:07.28 --> 01:41:12.88
People are replacing that crap with juggle white tea in a can.

2143
01:41:12.88 --> 01:41:14.16
One day it's going to be everywhere.

2144
01:41:14.16 --> 01:41:15.16
That's my suspicion.

2145
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:16.16
Yeah.

2146
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:18.92
You're just going to be people will just be, well, you know, the one you're not going

2147
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:19.92
to like, on.

2148
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:22.92
You know, speaking of, oh, you're also available in Canada.

2149
01:41:22.92 --> 01:41:25.52
I know a lot of Canadian folks say, wait, is this stuff?

2150
01:41:25.52 --> 01:41:26.52
Why can't I get up here?

2151
01:41:26.52 --> 01:41:28.52
So it's now available Amazon Canada.

2152
01:41:28.52 --> 01:41:29.52
Yeah.

2153
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:30.92
I'm going to put on the store too.

2154
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:31.92
Okay.

2155
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:32.92
And I've been working on it.

2156
01:41:32.92 --> 01:41:33.92
And we're almost there.

2157
01:41:33.92 --> 01:41:35.92
So check back with the store.

2158
01:41:35.92 --> 01:41:36.92
Talk with store.

2159
01:41:36.92 --> 01:41:37.92
Okay.

2160
01:41:37.92 --> 01:41:38.92
That's been placed to have them.

2161
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:39.92
They can get the tea wherever.

2162
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:40.92
I don't care if you're in.

2163
01:41:40.92 --> 01:41:42.92
We're a chocolate products or so.

2164
01:41:42.92 --> 01:41:44.92
That's where they're sold.

2165
01:41:44.92 --> 01:41:47.92
Speaking of Amazon books.

2166
01:41:47.92 --> 01:41:48.92
I got some books.

2167
01:41:48.92 --> 01:41:49.42
Good.

2168
01:41:49.42 --> 01:41:50.42
Yeah.

2169
01:41:50.42 --> 01:41:53.42
One, two are called the way of the word kid.

2170
01:41:53.42 --> 01:41:56.42
Way of the word kid from Wimpy to Warrior.

2171
01:41:56.42 --> 01:41:57.42
Right.

2172
01:41:57.42 --> 01:41:59.42
That's the what do you call it after the colon that part.

2173
01:41:59.42 --> 01:42:00.42
That's a subtitle.

2174
01:42:00.42 --> 01:42:01.42
Sure.

2175
01:42:01.42 --> 01:42:02.42
There it is.

2176
01:42:02.42 --> 01:42:03.42
Wimpy to work.

2177
01:42:03.42 --> 01:42:05.42
And then the second one is Mark's mission.

2178
01:42:05.42 --> 01:42:09.42
Really clever evolution of problems to be solved in both.

2179
01:42:09.42 --> 01:42:11.42
So now you have the ethos.

2180
01:42:11.42 --> 01:42:12.42
Okay.

2181
01:42:12.42 --> 01:42:13.42
So hi.

2182
01:42:13.42 --> 01:42:14.42
I did it.

2183
01:42:14.42 --> 01:42:15.42
Do it is.

2184
01:42:15.42 --> 01:42:16.42
I read the first one.

2185
01:42:16.42 --> 01:42:18.42
And I just keep repeating to my kids.

2186
01:42:18.42 --> 01:42:19.42
And about time many kids become a거 and many kids would be fake.

2187
01:42:19.42 --> 01:42:21.42
I forgot about individual models, they have actual technologies.

2188
01:42:21.42 --> 01:42:29.46
I didn't just

2189
01:42:21.42 --> 01:42:36.42
let's add i'ma welcome he would they would not do magic with bro.

2190
01:42:34.42 --> 01:42:35.42
Cute sound.

2191
01:42:35.42 --> 01:42:37.42
I understand I don't culture it.

2192
01:42:37.42 --> 01:42:40.44
You know gob anyone has digital in this speech or a fucking

2193
01:42:40.44 --> 01:42:41.42
game, don't you?

2194
01:42:41.42 --> 01:42:42.42
Let me get you a piece jak.

2195
01:42:42.42 --> 01:42:46.80
But yeah, it's a good one also the discipline equals freedom field manual

2196
01:42:47.30 --> 01:42:52.06
It's field manual that's kind of manual in my opinion, but this is like a manual for life

2197
01:42:52.06 --> 01:42:55.26
I think it's like a very basic backbone for life

2198
01:42:55.26 --> 01:43:01.62
It is start there you'll be you'll be solid. I'm always stoked when I meet someone that comes up and it's like

2199
01:43:02.14 --> 01:43:04.14
Real bad you will you?

2200
01:43:04.14 --> 01:43:07.44
I'm on the path. They're like they're not kidding. They're on the path

2201
01:43:07.44 --> 01:43:12.86
Yeah, crack that thing open read two pages read two pages to prep

2203
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:20.04
audible

2204
01:43:20.04 --> 01:43:21.54
It's available on

2205
01:43:21.54 --> 01:43:27.80
iTunes Amazon music Google play as an MP3 album with tracks that's where you can get it of course

2206
01:43:27.80 --> 01:43:29.80

2207
01:43:29.80 --> 01:43:33.64
Extreme ownership you can get the the the hard cover book

2208
01:43:33.64 --> 01:43:40.82
Mm-hmm and you can also get the audible that one you can get the audible version and the audible version is

2209
01:43:41.02 --> 01:43:43.02
Lafe and I reading

2210
01:43:44.20 --> 01:43:46.20
That book

2211
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:49.84
That's that's who's reading it that's who's doing the narration and then

2212
01:43:51.04 --> 01:43:54.72
Also, life and I have a book called the dichotomy of leadership

2213
01:43:55.08 --> 01:44:00.96
Which I've talked about dichotomy all the time on this podcast the reason I talk about it's because it's hard to

2214
01:44:00.96 --> 01:44:02.96
I

2215
01:44:02.96 --> 01:44:07.16
Don't even say master. It's hard to even get a grip on that dichotomy the different dichotomy is inside of leadership

2216
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:14.88
Mm-hmm and so Lafe and I knew that we had to go into a more granular level of explanation of the dichotomy of leadership

2217
01:44:14.88 --> 01:44:18.64
And that's what this new book is it comes out September

2218
01:44:19.16 --> 01:44:26.16
25th and also for leadership training live inside your organization whatever that organization might be

2219
01:44:26.16 --> 01:44:33.36
Check out my company Ashland front leadership consulting we solve problems through leadership

2220
01:44:33.64 --> 01:44:39.24
That's that we have one more master in 2018 the

2221
01:44:39.24 --> 01:44:41.24
Master is a

2222
01:44:41.56 --> 01:44:47.56
Leadership conference we have one more in 2018 it is in San Francisco October 17th and 18th

2223
01:44:48.72 --> 01:44:52.68
October 17th and 18th all the other ones that we've done have sold out

2224
01:44:52.68 --> 01:44:58.40
If you want to come get your ticket you can get an extreme ownership dot com and also for current

2225
01:44:59.40 --> 01:45:04.12
uniform personnel so people in the military law enforcement board patrol firefighters

2226
01:45:04.56 --> 01:45:07.92
Paramedics first responders we have a roll call number one

2227
01:45:09.40 --> 01:45:11.40
September 21st in Dallas, Texas

2228
01:45:11.88 --> 01:45:15.32
That's also you can also register for that extreme ownership dot com

2229
01:45:16.68 --> 01:45:20.40
That's one day focused on the dynamic leadership

2230
01:45:20.40 --> 01:45:22.40
Environment so that's like a

2231
01:45:23.08 --> 01:45:30.32
Master more focused on the issues of first responders, essentially, yeah, but it is essentially a master

2232
01:45:30.32 --> 01:45:39.16
It's a mustard like shorter. It's a shorter master. It's more focused. It's a cheaper price point and it's one day. There's less

2233
01:45:41.28 --> 01:45:45.04
A menteties right so when you come to the master everything's kind of

2234
01:45:45.04 --> 01:45:50.64
Kind of decked out like the lunch meals really good the dinners great

2235
01:45:50.64 --> 01:45:54.40
It's like decked out to take into the highest level the

2236
01:45:55.44 --> 01:45:59.64
Roll call is like hey, we're here to get the information out to people that need it

2237
01:46:00.16 --> 01:46:03.68
People that are in the field every day whether it's in the military whether it's on the beat is a cop

2238
01:46:03.92 --> 01:46:09.40
Whether it's a firefighter, you know for people that are on the job people in uniform that we try and support

2239
01:46:10.04 --> 01:46:13.36
They need this leadership training. They asked for this leadership training

2240
01:46:13.36 --> 01:46:17.60
We needed to do an energy preprisepoint. What could we save money? You still get it done. There you go

2241
01:46:17.60 --> 01:46:21.46
That's what that's what that's what the roll call is but it's the same deal as far as there's no backstage

2242
01:46:21.46 --> 01:46:24.46
Oh, no, that's the game

2243
01:46:24.46 --> 01:46:29.06
Talking everybody the whole day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be there no

2244
01:46:29.80 --> 01:46:31.80

2245
01:46:31.80 --> 01:46:33.80

2246
01:46:33.80 --> 01:46:42.92
Big time at either the mustard or the roll call or the immersion camp in Maine if you want to roll with us

2247
01:46:43.96 --> 01:46:48.52
Virtually we are all up on the interwebs on Twitter and

2248
01:46:49.32 --> 01:46:51.32
Instagram and that's

2249
01:46:51.32 --> 01:46:53.32
Pacy block
