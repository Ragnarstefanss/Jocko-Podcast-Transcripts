[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number three, 17 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening. All right. The Marine Corps, specifically the Marine Corps, Institute has,
[00:00:15] well they seem to do this on a regular basis, they put out manuals with,
[00:00:20] with some incredible insight about leadership, about human nature, about combat.
[00:00:30] It is not just about combat. It's not just about combat at all. The things that they put out
[00:00:39] applied directly to business and to life in general, and I'm going to read some excerpts today
[00:00:45] from a manual that was actually designed for remote learning, and I think these days when we think
[00:00:50] a remote learning, we think of Zoom calls. This is old school remote learning where you get a book,
[00:00:58] read a book, read a section, learn about something, take tests inside the sections. It's a,
[00:01:06] it's one of those. It's a remote learning old school remote learning where you'd get a book, a manual,
[00:01:10] filling answers, read sections, this particular class is called infantry squad leader,
[00:01:18] combat leadership. And I'm just going to review some of the texts. If you go online,
[00:01:24] there's, you can go online and get this manual, and there's questions, and there's quizzes, and
[00:01:29] there's, it's a full-on course, but the text that's in it, it's a very well written text,
[00:01:39] and addresses things that apply to everything that everyone does all the time, every day,
[00:01:47] stuff, stuff we all have to contend with. So here we go. infantry squad leader
[00:01:56] from the Marine Corps Institute, combat leadership. It starts off with a little cover letter
[00:02:04] from the director of the Marine Corps Institute. This, this subject course provides instruction
[00:02:12] for all marine NGOs on the conditions of combat, and how they can begin to prepare their
[00:02:16] Marines for combat. Now, if you aren't a Marine and you're a business leader or you're a
[00:02:22] football coach or you're a parent in a family, I think you're going to see this applies to you too,
[00:02:29] 100% and it'll do you and I can throw around 100% from time to time, just sort of
[00:02:38] a little bit much, 100%. But I'm telling you this one right here, 100%. So starts off, and this is
[00:02:45] the way they, but this is what I like about the Marine Corps thinks through some stuff. Here's
[00:02:49] something they've fought through. It starts off with us. Congratulations on your enrollment in a distance
[00:02:56] education course from the distance learning and technologies department of the Marine Corps Institute.
[00:03:01] Since 1920, the Marine Corps Institute has been helping tens of thousands of hard charging
[00:03:06] Marines like you improve their technical job performance skills through distance learning. By
[00:03:13] enrolling in this course, you have shown a desire to improve the skills you have and master new
[00:03:18] skills to enhance your job performance. They're building you up just as you read
[00:03:26] this. You're getting in the game. Here's your personal character. Actually, it's going to tell you
[00:03:31] what your personal characteristics are. You are properly motivated. You have made a positive decision
[00:03:37] to get training on your own. Self motivation is perhaps the most important force in learning or
[00:03:42] achieving anything. Doing whatever is necessary to learn is motivation. You have it. That's a good tactic
[00:03:50] by the way. You seek to improve yourself. Now again, does this apply to just Marines and combat?
[00:03:56] How many human beings are looking to improve themselves? Everyone. You seek to improve yourself.
[00:04:03] You unroll to improve those skills. You already possess and learn new skills when you improve
[00:04:08] yourself. You improve the core. You have the initiative to act by acting on your own. You have
[00:04:16] shown you are a self-starter willing to reach out for opportunities to learn and grow.
[00:04:20] These are the most positive attributes they can put on a human being and they're just throwing them.
[00:04:26] How about this one? You accept challenges. You have self confidence and belief in your ability
[00:04:31] to acquire knowledge and skills. You have the self confidence to set goals in the ability to
[00:04:34] achieve them and enabling you to meet every challenge. You are able to set and accomplish
[00:04:42] practical goals. You are willing to commit time, effort and resources necessary to set and accomplish
[00:04:47] your goals. These professional traits will help you successfully complete this distance learning course.
[00:04:53] I was actually thinking we were going to go into like all another realm of living. But it is going
[00:04:58] to help us with this distance learning course as well. Start off a little section called
[00:05:03] characteristics of combat. Every Marine is a warrior, a potential combat leader. You may be in combat
[00:05:09] tomorrow. Regardless of how well your unit is trained, you must harden yourself for your first action.
[00:05:15] You do not need to experience combat in order to understand the essential requirements for leading
[00:05:18] your Marines in combat. However, it is fundamental, it is your fundamental responsibility to
[00:05:23] physically and mentally prepare yourself and your Marines for battle.
[00:05:29] Now, are we just talking about Marines? What about life? What about life? You may be in a hard
[00:05:35] situation tomorrow. That's what's going on. So you got to prepare for that. So this starts off with
[00:05:43] an excerpt. This is probably the longest excerpt that I'm going to read. It's from a book called
[00:05:50] the Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sare. It's a book that we actually haven't covered on this podcast.
[00:05:55] I'm going to a little bit of why that is. But here we go. We had just witnessed two or three major
[00:06:02] assaults. From the screams of anguish to our left, we concluded that a great many of our men had
[00:06:09] been killed. We had emptied five magazines and were warming our fingers on the hot metal of the
[00:06:15] machine gun. Our six and last magazine had been attached and we were anxiously waiting for fresh
[00:06:21] supplies. The night was continuously lit by the explosions of thousands of Russian shells, which made
[00:06:28] movement extremely difficult. Our trenches, which in any case were not deep enough, extended
[00:06:34] only to certain positions. The others had to be reached by leaps and bounds, alternating with
[00:06:40] plunges to the ground and writhing on our stomachs across dozens of yards of snow mixed with chunks
[00:06:46] of frozen earth. From time to time, we could see four figures moving toward us jumping from
[00:06:53] crater to crater carrying shells for our 50 millimeter mortar and magazines for the spand out.
[00:07:00] They were still about 40 yards away when their shadowing mass was surrounded by a flash of white light.
[00:07:08] We never heard any cries. A few minutes later, I was sent out to crawl to the point of impact.
[00:07:14] The sergeant ordered me to bring back at least two magazines. I had just arrived at my
[00:07:19] destination when I heard the Russian assault cry, followed by shower of grenades and mortar shells.
[00:07:26] The ground shook beneath me in a manner which defied all predictions. I felt like a pea inside a
[00:07:33] fierce, ferociously beaten drum. I was lying flat on the ground among the bodies of comrades
[00:07:39] killed only a few minutes before unable to see any of the supplies I'd been sent to fetch.
[00:07:44] Then I heard the sound of a tank. The darkness all around me was broken by streaks of light
[00:07:52] and large pink and yellow explosions. In a momentary beam from some headlight, I could see a small
[00:08:00] sign marked S157. I opened my mouth wide as prescribed because I could hardly breathe and
[00:08:09] lay where I was frantically groping for something to hang onto in the diabolical setting where
[00:08:15] horizontal and vertical alternated to the rhythm of the lights which slashed the darkness.
[00:08:21] I thought that I could recognize the uproar. The crackle of the weapon I had
[00:08:27] operated with whiner before, I had only left a moment ago and felt that my sanity might be close to
[00:08:35] collapse. I could see no escape from my situation and lay glued to the ground with my head down
[00:08:43] like a trust animal waiting for the butcher's axe. So it goes on a little bit further with this
[00:08:54] section which is out of that book that forgotten soldier. We haven't covered that book on the
[00:08:59] podcast, the forgotten soldier. We probably will at some point. There's some disputes about the
[00:09:07] veracity of the book and the author, I think I just read a little bit more about this last night.
[00:09:18] The author, Guy Sarah, he, there's some important details that he misses that he just gets wrong.
[00:09:25] One of them is there's some patch that they had in this unit and it was this highly regarded patch
[00:09:33] and he talks about how they sewed it onto their right sleeve or left sleeve or something like that.
[00:09:38] And people that were in that unit said no way would any buddy that was in that unit ever make a mistake
[00:09:47] about where to sew that patch on. That's one of the types of things or there's certain weapons
[00:09:53] that he talks about that weren't there. He talks about an aircraft that didn't exist at this time.
[00:10:00] So there's some things in there that there's some details that were wrong and some of the veterans
[00:10:05] that fought in the same battles. This him have called Mount Sinan. This guy is not telling the
[00:10:11] truth about some stuff. And then there's other veterans that talk about the battles or that he
[00:10:16] writes about and say hey the only way he would know this stuff is if he was there. So and here's the
[00:10:22] thing memory is not accurate and people's memories aren't accurate and certainly people's memory
[00:10:27] about intense combat operations is inaccurate and he eventually made a statement about
[00:10:34] that and kind of said that said hey if you want to know the historical details go ask a general
[00:10:39] that was in an action about to go off a little bit. He doesn't say that. Go he says go ask a military
[00:10:45] historian go ask a general because that's what they do. I didn't want to do that. I'm my
[00:10:48] books about the emotions of a combat soldier. But the reason they put this in here is to get a good
[00:10:58] account of the chaos and mayhem and fear inside a combat and then you roll right into this section here
[00:11:05] which is called fear of combat. It starts off with this we have all experienced fear. In combat
[00:11:10] fear can dominate the situation unless you and your Marines can control it. Extreme fear brings out
[00:11:16] your instinct for self preservation. Survival drive survival is a very strong drive which generally
[00:11:23] will be a priority concern to any Marine. As I was reading this and again I'm reading these
[00:11:31] things in the context of life and fear is something that people contend with every single day
[00:11:39] and it's all in all kinds of different levels but whether it's fear of presenting in front of
[00:11:44] a client whether it's fear of asking for a raise whether it's fear of confronting some situation
[00:11:53] whether it's fear of going to a Gigiitsu class for the first time like there's all kinds of
[00:11:59] fears that people face on a daily basis. And here's some good information that yes it'll help you
[00:12:06] if you're combat Marine but it'll also help you if you're a human. Specific sources of fear.
[00:12:11] peacetime training may not prepare your Marines for the reality that combat is often a matter of
[00:12:15] killer be killed. Some of the specific sources of fear in combat are possibility of being killed
[00:12:21] wounded or captured fear of killing. Noise and sights of combat apprehensive that you might not
[00:12:27] measure up as a Marine under fire and the last one is fatigue. So possibility of being killed
[00:12:36] wounded or captured this is a natural source of fear and always we will be present in your Marines.
[00:12:42] It may lead your Marines to run away from battle or do irrational things in battle. There is no
[00:12:46] sure way to know which Marine may be subject to such an extreme reaction to fear to this fear
[00:12:52] until you get in a combat. Fear of killing this is not uncommon. Our society is a peaceful one by
[00:13:01] nature. We are raised to respect the rights of all human beings and have to and to have respect for life.
[00:13:09] To forget these facts is to ignore the reality of our culture.
[00:13:15] Another one is the noise and sights of combat. These elements have a traumatic shocking impact
[00:13:21] on the senses. This causes confusion and a sense of chaos that can be come particularly unnerving.
[00:13:27] No peace, I'm training can completely prepare you and your Marines for the carnage and emotional
[00:13:32] impact of combat. To ignore this aspect of combat is to create a lack of understanding
[00:13:39] that could prove totally debilitating to your Marines. One thing I like about this is it's no
[00:13:45] no punches are pulled. Hey guess what? The carnage and emotional impact of combat
[00:13:52] are you're not going to be able to train for that 100%. You can't completely train for that.
[00:13:59] It doesn't sugarcoat.
[00:14:02] And then the last one is the apprehension that you might not measure up as a Marine
[00:14:07] under fire or let your buddies down may be common among your Marines. All of your Marines
[00:14:12] want to be successful. Their fears may play on this desire and they may be definitely afraid of
[00:14:17] letting you or their fellow Marines down. This particular fear may serve as a positive factor
[00:14:23] by keeping your unit cohesive during battle. It could be detrimental if the fear overcomes
[00:14:29] the desire to succeed. And they've got a quote in here from SLA Marshall, Metagins Fire.
[00:14:35] When fires sweeps the field, nothing keeps a man from running. Except a sense of honor.
[00:14:42] The bound obligation to the people right around him of fear of failure in their site, which might
[00:14:49] eternally disgrace him. So it's interesting to think about, so this is like it says a positive
[00:14:55] factor. So how does it become a negative factor? It becomes a negative factor when your fear of
[00:15:01] letting people down doesn't allow you to actually go and do something. So if you, obviously on
[00:15:08] the battlefield, that could be a thing. I don't want to take charge of that. I don't want to
[00:15:12] step up because I don't want to make a bad decision. I don't want to let my friends down. And it
[00:15:16] can happen in everyday life. This does happen in everyday life. People don't want to look stupid.
[00:15:21] People don't want to have people say, oh, you know, Jockel failed. Jockel is a loser. So instead,
[00:15:29] I just don't try anything. So we have to be careful with that. This is, I think, a good thing to think
[00:15:36] about is even though people, let's say you try something echo Charles and you fail,
[00:15:46] I might even verbally owe echo. See, he's a loser. But you know what? I think subconsciously,
[00:15:52] and in some cases, consciously, everybody knows everybody respects that you got, you know,
[00:15:58] you got up. You took a swing, right? Took a swing at bat. And especially if they're cowards
[00:16:05] themselves and it's really easy to sit in the audience and watch and poke fun. Right?
[00:16:13] Don't be that person. That's it. It's the audience and poke fun. Get up to bat.
[00:16:20] Don't be afraid of looking bad. I guess my point is, don't be afraid of looking bad because
[00:16:25] you don't actually look bad. When you make an attempt, when you step up, people respect it.
[00:16:30] Even if they try and bring you down, they're they're lying. They're just trying to bring you down
[00:16:35] because they know that you stepped up and they didn't. Don't be afraid of that.
[00:16:43] And the last source of fear is fatigue. Both mental and physical fatigue is a source of
[00:16:49] fear. As you become exhausted, your ability to reason maybe get into deteriorate. As you become
[00:16:55] more and more tired, you may become indecisive and slow and carrying out your orders. When
[00:17:01] you confront the daily and costly with the stress of combat coupled with fatigue, you and your
[00:17:05] Marines may feel helpless and unable to continue the fight. And they've got a quote in here
[00:17:12] from major general heart from a book called Determination in Bathletes says,
[00:17:18] there's no doubt that troops, however well-led, can only take the stress of battle for so long.
[00:17:23] Then they break. Ask any commander at any level who tries to overdraw the account.
[00:17:30] It's according disaster. The mental and the physical constantly interact.
[00:17:36] Therefore, physical fatigue, hunger, disease, thirst and above all, the stress of adverse
[00:17:42] climactic climatic conditions can reduce the physical state of the soldier to such an extent
[00:17:49] that is will to fight will be broken. Fatigue makes cowards of us all echo Charles.
[00:17:57] Do you agree with that? Do you feel like I'm personally attacking you right now?
[00:18:02] Yeah, if you want to. Yeah, that is a disturbing thing. But this is something that
[00:18:11] you don't fall prey to it quite as much, but man in the early days of Jiu Jitsu. And by
[00:18:16] early days, when you were like a purple belt, you didn't like it and tired at all. You used to really
[00:18:23] bother you. I still don't like getting tired. But I think, you know, when you can kind of
[00:18:28] reconcile the whole big picture where, you know, this kind of, it's obvious now, or like, okay,
[00:18:34] the best way to fight your fears to get used to that thing, that you don't like or whatever. So,
[00:18:41] yeah, so yeah, you conditioned, but here's this is how I know that I still don't like it.
[00:18:47] We're like, if I didn't, if I haven't done any conditioning for a while, and I'm like,
[00:18:51] I gotta get back into conditioning that first day, I'm like, oh my god, this is, I can feel it.
[00:18:56] It's like, is it, is I wouldn't call it a fear of the conditioning, but you ever had a
[00:19:01] work, yeah, like, you know, okay, you know how you stuck on the 20 reps squats, right? You know,
[00:19:05] when you got the 20 reps squats coming and you know that pain is coming, you know, you
[00:19:09] can't get the butterflies a little bit before that, I mean, I don't know if you do.
[00:19:14] I don't get the butterflies, I get like the, I get rationalization. You know, so I'll be thinking,
[00:19:21] you know what, I don't, this is, this is really kind of the work out that's really good for you.
[00:19:26] You know what I mean, I like start having all these conversations with myself. Yeah, and it's just
[00:19:30] lies. Yeah, that's part of it too, but mine was for real, like, I'll be nervous of the conditioning,
[00:19:36] like I don't, because and maybe this has a lot to do with like the kind of workouts that I've always
[00:19:40] like done or whatever, where you kind of have a standard where you, you know, okay, so if I have four
[00:19:45] exercises that I'm going to do as part of conditioning circuit, I four exercises, and I do one,
[00:19:52] the other, do the other, and I have a time to rest in between, like, you know, 20 seconds or 30
[00:19:57] seconds or do them all with no rest and then rest 30 seconds or whatever. To me, if I don't,
[00:20:03] if I have to rest more than the 30 seconds, like, I can't go, you know, like, I can't, like,
[00:20:08] you know, 30 seconds comes and I can't go because I got to rest more, I failed to work up.
[00:20:12] It's like going for a PR and failing it, right? How do you measure the 30 seconds? I have a clock going.
[00:20:20] What do you press start when you get to the end of whatever you're doing? No, so you just have the
[00:20:25] stopwatch going, so you start it and then you do it and you keep the stopwatch at that first circuit.
[00:20:30] So when you're done and you're back to the first circuit or you're, you're, you're finished the last circuit,
[00:20:35] you see and you do the math in your hands. You just run the math. Do you ever do work out to where
[00:20:41] you're not thinking straight? Like, it's for the running math because sometimes when I'm, I'm not running
[00:20:45] math. Yeah, it's an added thing. There's just some things going on. Yeah, 30 seconds is easy, though.
[00:20:51] Yeah. To run the math, but oh, yeah, it's an additional mental thing. That kind of, it's like,
[00:20:55] a mental conditioning for every two minutes. Yeah, but I'll be nervous though before it. Like, if I
[00:21:00] don't, if I haven't been doing it for a while, I'll be like kind of nervous like, what if I can't do it?
[00:21:05] You know, it's my workout. Well, now what am I scared of you? But I was saying I'll have that thought.
[00:21:10] It's weird. All right. Well, that's an effective fear, which is the next section here.
[00:21:15] A effects on the squad. Fear is infectious. It can destroy the effectiveness of your squad,
[00:21:22] recognize fear and deal with it promptly. Poison important as a leader.
[00:21:29] Automatic body reactions physically, your body reacts when threatened or when you anticipate
[00:21:34] danger listed below are automatic body reactions to fear trembling, heart pounding, irrational
[00:21:41] laughter, sweating, tunnel vision, auditory exclusion, fight or flight response.
[00:21:48] Have you ever been trembling and fear before? Not that I can. What about, so when you're
[00:21:57] getting ready for these workouts that you're scared of? I'm not trembling. Have you ever,
[00:22:04] I remember sometimes when we were getting ready to do an off, like I look at some people in the room
[00:22:08] and sometimes they, not trend. I'm trembling, no, but like shaking, like taping their foot real
[00:22:15] hard and just that kind of stuff moving around a lot. Super nervous. Well, that makes sense.
[00:22:22] 100%. Yeah, you're going to go in on a military operation. Yes, they're interesting.
[00:22:28] But no, I haven't been on a military operation. I guess in football games before
[00:22:33] football games, I'd y'all in all the time for them. That's one of those things. It's like
[00:22:36] involuntary. Yeah, where it's weird, but what about your stomach? Yes, you know, like I'll
[00:22:44] feel a little bit sick. Yeah, so it would be, and it wouldn't be my stomach. I'd have a weird
[00:22:48] gag reflex and remember, remember Scott Catlin. Oh yeah, yeah. So he would like everyone's
[00:22:53] while he'd be at the tournament with me or whatever and he'd be in training with me and stuff a
[00:22:57] lot. So in the tournaments, like before my first match, only I'd have a weird gag, like almost like
[00:23:04] I want to throw up. And I did it feel consciously nervous, but obviously, we're obviously, yeah,
[00:23:10] my body was like, I wouldn't like throw up, but I had a weird gag thing and he'd be like,
[00:23:14] don't start their shit now. And actually, know what though, what I messed up here is that this is,
[00:23:18] I don't think I said it's not. It is fear. I was going to say maybe this is just about fatigue,
[00:23:23] because it says fatigue causes fear. I was thinking that this was just fatigue, but no,
[00:23:27] this is actually just what fear does to you. Some psychological reactions to inability to
[00:23:31] make decisions, obsession with minor details, oh, I've seen that before.
[00:23:37] Lack of confidence, breakdown of discipline. You've in in psychology for the incompetence,
[00:23:46] military incompetence. He talked about how some leaders would become obsessed with details.
[00:23:52] Good, that's because they were just scared. Oh, we need to do this again. Let me go. Let me get
[00:23:57] her. Yeah. Yeah. Something I want you out for. Some extreme reactions to fear occur when the
[00:24:03] individual has confronted a situation where death appears to be imminent during such instances,
[00:24:09] two basic forms of behavior have been observed. Aggression and rage, one freezing under fire, two.
[00:24:18] Going to some details, aggression and rage from combat motivation by Anthony Kelet was this
[00:24:24] statement from a German soldier on the eastern front during World War II describing how German
[00:24:28] soldiers reacted when overrun by Russian hordes. The quote below describes aggression and rage,
[00:24:33] we fault like rats, which do not hesitate to spring with all their teeth buried when they are
[00:24:39] cornered by a man infinitely larger than they are. And then freezing under fire, the other
[00:24:45] and the spectrum from Medikas fire by Assela Marshall came the term freezing under,
[00:24:51] writing about action in Omaha Beach, World War II, the Copa low describes freezing under fire.
[00:24:58] They sat there numbly in the line of fire, their minds blanked out, their fingers to
[00:25:04] nerveless to hold the weapon. Fighter flight, that's what we're talking about.
[00:25:12] And here's some conditions that stimulate fear. You got to overcome your own fears,
[00:25:18] though you share the same risks in fear. You must be able to overcome your own fear and provide
[00:25:23] the leadership necessary to achieve success in combat. The Marines you lead are your Marines.
[00:25:29] You've lived, trained, sweated and grown into an effective fighting unit together.
[00:25:34] Before you face a violent brutal and cunning enemy, you must understand the conditions that
[00:25:38] stimulate fear, inspire confidence and encourage in and encourage in your Marines.
[00:25:43] This is a quote here from Battle Leadership Captain Vaughn Shell, which we've covered on
[00:25:49] white. I don't know, maybe the fourth or fifth podcast here. In peace, we learn how to lead
[00:25:54] companies, battians, regiments, even divisions and armies. We learn in books and by maps how one
[00:26:00] fights and wins battles, but we are not instructed in the thoughts, the hopes, the fears that
[00:26:04] run riot in the mind of the front lines soldier.
[00:26:07] There are three conditions that stimulate fear, unexpected unknown and feelings of helplessness.
[00:26:19] That's a good breakdown. Yes, it is unexpected. Well, unknown and helplessness of
[00:26:26] whole. And I think that's the tired part where tired fatigue is like part of fear.
[00:26:33] Yeah, because you know you're going to be helpless. Straight up. Unexpected.
[00:26:40] Enemy actions that appear as a surprise will have a powerful impact upon your Marines.
[00:26:45] Being surprised by the enemy has been described as causing the quote, will that control's fear
[00:26:52] to sag and crumble. When your Marines begin to sense that they do not have control over
[00:26:59] their situation, they may begin to panic at such moments. You must exert a strong influence upon them
[00:27:07] to maintain control over the unit's actions.
[00:27:12] Surprises a big deal. I can't help but think of this. I also think of the other end of the
[00:27:17] spectrum. The opposite end of the spectrum, which is what you want to impose surprise on your enemy.
[00:27:23] Right, you want to. That's one of the speed surprising violence of action. One of the
[00:27:29] models of the seal teams and really have combat in general. Because that's what it does. It's the
[00:27:36] same thing. And you know, like on the mats. That's a surprise thing. That's when you get caught.
[00:27:43] Unknown. Your Marines will worry about what they have not seen and what they do not know.
[00:27:49] You will have a tendency to think the enemy is much greater in strength than ability, but
[00:27:55] really is not. Do not be deceived as to enemy strength or capabilities to exaggerate it in
[00:27:59] impressions. This is Mikey in the dragons. The dragons you think the dragons are all
[00:28:04] being big and scary, but they're not. And this is something important to think about. Because
[00:28:09] the context here is like, hey, you're leading troops and they're scared of the enemy. They're
[00:28:14] scared of your competitor. They think the competitors got all the advantages. They don't.
[00:28:22] Feelings of helplessness. You. And it's got that capitalized. You must prevent this from
[00:28:29] taking hold. Act to direct and inspire the response against the enemy. Everyone has a job that
[00:28:35] must be accomplished. Ensure that everyone is doing what must be done. And this is key.
[00:28:41] Action is a way to prevent this condition from taking hold. Keep your Marines busy. Now look,
[00:28:47] I don't like saying keep people busy. And they do actually talk about this a decent amount in this
[00:28:53] book, but I have to admit that it is true. The same thing that causes an individual to get obsessed
[00:29:01] with some details is the same thing when you're teet. They're trying to distract their mind from
[00:29:06] what's going on. So you can actually utilize activity to prevent this. But also, so there's one
[00:29:15] thing like, oh, I can see that Ecos nervous about tomorrow. Hey, Ecos, can you do me favor and
[00:29:21] help me load up the vehicles with water? And you're like, okay, because now you're thinking about that.
[00:29:28] That's one part of it. Like almost that administrative part of it. But then also, if there's
[00:29:33] something happening, for if we're in a gunfight and you start freaking out or you start looking
[00:29:40] scared, you know, it's echo, get over there, pick up security in that door. Okay, now you got something
[00:29:43] to do. You got, you know, so there's an administrative way to do it. And there's also an active moment
[00:29:52] to actually give people direction. And as soon as we're taking action, we're moving in the
[00:29:57] right direction. We're moving in the right direction for taking action. One of the worst things we
[00:30:02] can do is let the team sit there and dwell over what's unfolding around us. Let's do something.
[00:30:10] There's an example in here. He was firing behind a log. His face was gray. His eyes were dull
[00:30:18] and without hope. He stopped firing and looked around. It didn't do any good. He said,
[00:30:25] his voice was flat and he was speaking to no one in particular. I got three of them, but did do any
[00:30:30] good. They just kept coming. They just keep coming. Platoon sergeant, Kazimere, Palakowski,
[00:30:40] known as ski. Said, what the hell are you beefing at? You get paid for it. Don't you? The kid
[00:30:48] managed to grin as ski crawled on down the line. The boy, now a man, was once more squeezing them off.
[00:30:55] That's from a book called Guadalcanal Diary, Richard Trugaskis,
[00:31:07] leadership role. Additionally, the first shock of realizing that the enemy actually
[00:31:12] intends to kill you is a powerful factor that everyone will face. Until this threshold is crossed
[00:31:17] and your marines become accustomed to the to functioning under fire, you must act decisively
[00:31:23] to ignite the confidence and individual actions that will transform fear into an aggressive response.
[00:31:29] Your presence as a leader has tremendous value in overcoming fear, particularly at night,
[00:31:34] adverse weather, or during loll's in the action. During these times, imaginations run wild.
[00:31:41] And your marines think they may be alone or isolated. So again, taking action and
[00:31:48] influencing there to be action in these moments when people are nervous or scared,
[00:31:55] that's a great move to overcome fear. Next section is stresses of combat.
[00:32:01] And again, these are extreme examples. This is combat examples, but there's stress in every job,
[00:32:06] there's stress in every business, there's stress in life.
[00:32:12] Killing the enemy that's trying to kill you is only half the battle.
[00:32:15] To your marines and during discomfort fatigue and the other hazards and stresses of combat
[00:32:22] is what must be done so that they can succeed in combat. Sources of stress in combat fatigue,
[00:32:28] discomfort casualties boredom. As you become for fatigue, as you become increasingly tired,
[00:32:35] you will lose the ability to make decisions rapidly. You will become more easily confused,
[00:32:38] disoriented and ultimately ineffective. You must understand the effects of fatigue on yourself
[00:32:44] and your marines and when to provide for rest, especially amidst the chaos of battle.
[00:32:52] Here's some key indicators of fatigue, reckless disregard for safety yourself,
[00:32:56] of self or fellow marines, excessive caution or unwillingness to expose oneself to risk,
[00:33:02] failure to fire weapons, lack of concern for the condition of weapons or other equipment,
[00:33:06] lack of concern for personal clenliness. So all those things are what we need to watch out for as leaders,
[00:33:15] when people are not engaged anymore.
[00:33:21] Develop, here's some things you can do, develop a sleep plan for your unit that to ensure that everyone
[00:33:26] including yourself gets a minimum of four hours of sleep per day, situation permitted.
[00:33:33] Rest is preventative treatment that keeps senseless casualties from occurring.
[00:33:40] So there you go, Aquatrolse. Making sure, I want you to make sure you get four hours.
[00:33:47] Listen for those people that are freak out because I wake up early and think I hate sleep.
[00:33:56] I don't hate sleep. Sleep is good for you. You should sleep a bunch. It's when you heal.
[00:34:01] It's when you get strong. It's how you maintain your mental and physical health.
[00:34:08] So you should sleep and you should sleep a lot. Which is why I thought it was kind of funny that they said,
[00:34:12] hey, look, hey, Adam minimum, you've got to get four hours. I will say that's a number, though,
[00:34:17] in extreme situations. Four hours is like something that you can maintain,
[00:34:24] functional for a long period of time. I know I can. Under four hours and it starts to chip away
[00:34:30] at me after a while. But if I can sleep for four hours, I'm kind of stoked.
[00:34:38] No, I know not normal day, normal day to day life. I sleep like six hours.
[00:34:43] Because that's what the body needs. Some people say eight, some people it's five, you know, different.
[00:34:50] Marines adversely suffering from the effects of being cold, wet, hungry thirst, your weary will determine
[00:34:57] their ability to fight well. Marines tend to develop a high tolerance for
[00:35:01] enduring the extremes of weather without much support. However, there is a point where morale is
[00:35:05] affected and your units actual ability to fight becomes questionable.
[00:35:12] At the first opportunity provide dry clothing protection from the elements food and water.
[00:35:17] There you go.
[00:35:17] So sources of stress in combat, the following excerpt from battle at best by SLA Marshall describes
[00:35:28] how taken care of your Marines pays its dividends in combat.
[00:35:35] And again, we covered SLA Marshall on this podcast. I forget what number and there's some
[00:35:41] definite concerns with the veracity of him and some of the information that he put out.
[00:35:48] But as I said, when we covered on the podcast, don't throw out the baby with the bath water.
[00:35:54] This is a really interesting case.
[00:35:58] At dark on eight December, the snowfall ceased and the cold intensified. Down along the canyon road,
[00:36:05] near the water gate, a brisk wind was piling the drifts as high as a man's head.
[00:36:09] At the battalion CP, which was partly sheltered by the canyon wall, the thermometer red
[00:36:16] 30 degrees below zero.
[00:36:20] Up on the wind swept cracks where Abel Company was clearing Chinese dead from the bunkers to make
[00:36:26] room for its own ranks. And at the same time, preparing to evacuate its own casualties down the
[00:36:32] iced slopes of the mountains, it must have been a touch colder than that, though there was no reading
[00:36:40] of the temperature. All batteries had frozen. Weapons were stiffening. The camp long since had run out
[00:36:49] of water because the freezing of cantines. To ease their thirst, the men ate snow and seemed to thrive on it.
[00:36:56] But of the many problems raised by the weather, the most severe one was getting an average good
[00:37:02] man to observe what the field manual so easily described as a, quote, common sense precaution.
[00:37:10] For example, prior to marching, Captain Barrow of Abel made certain that each of his men carried
[00:37:17] two spare pairs of socks. But that safeguard did not of itself ensure his force,
[00:37:24] though the men with feet, swedded from the rigors of the day were all at the point of
[00:37:31] becoming frostbite casualties by the hour of the Bivowack. And here's what Captain Barrow said.
[00:37:39] I learned that night that only leadership will save men under winter conditions.
[00:37:46] It's easy to say that men should change socks, getting it done as another matter.
[00:37:51] Boothlaces become iced over during prolonged engagements and snowdrifs.
[00:37:58] It's a fight to get a boot off the foot. When a man removes his gloves to struggle with the
[00:38:04] laces, it seems to him that his hands are freezing. His impulses all against it.
[00:38:11] So I found it necessary to do this by order, staying with the individuals until they had
[00:38:17] changed, then making them get up and move about to restore circulation.
[00:38:26] That process, simple in the telling consumed hours, by the time Barrow was satisfied that his command
[00:38:30] was relatively snug. It was wearing on toward midnight. Right then, his perimeter was hit by
[00:38:35] a counterattack and enemy force and puttune strength plus striking along the ridge line
[00:38:41] from a prop from 1081 in approximately the same formation which Barrow had used during the afternoon.
[00:38:48] All that needs to be told of his small action is summed up in Barrow's brief radio report.
[00:38:53] They hit us, we killed them all, all that we could see.
[00:38:58] We have countered 18 fresh bodies just outside our lines.
[00:39:03] By the way, this is Captain Barrow that became the 27th Commodant.
[00:39:07] So he had to go person to person and physically make sure they were doing exactly what he told
[00:39:16] them to do. Because the tendency is to curl up into a ball and die.
[00:39:24] And we covered some of the prison camps in Korea and that that individual
[00:39:31] specifically talked about that decision. Is there was people that just gave up and they're not
[00:39:38] going to do anything else and they're not going to try and they just accept the death.
[00:39:42] And the guys that live for the guys that said, no, I'm not going to give up.
[00:39:46] But these little things, like, you know, your feet are sweating and your socks are wet
[00:39:51] from working all day, climbing up this mountain and then you get up there and you're going to
[00:39:55] be up there for a while. You have to change your socks or a little too. You're going to freeze.
[00:39:57] And your ice is our laced up and it's colder than 30 degrees below zero.
[00:40:10] There's another source of stress in combat casualties. Seeing a fellow Marine go down has a
[00:40:15] traumatic impact upon you and your Marines brutal combat as brutal and casualties are to be
[00:40:21] expected. The shock of seeing your buddies wounded or killed in a possibility that may happen to them
[00:40:26] adds the fear and apprehension of the survivors. It increases your Marines reluctance to take risks
[00:40:32] and obey you. How individuals respond after their units taken casualties is a key indicator of
[00:40:38] their effectiveness of their training, self-discipline and preparation for combat.
[00:40:48] Proper care for your wounded has a great effect upon morale, assuring your Marines that if they
[00:40:53] are hit, their fellow Marines will take care of them. There's an unwritten code among Marines that
[00:40:57] if wounded and unable to defend for yourself another Marine will come to your aid. And look,
[00:41:01] that exists in the Marine Corps, but that should exist in your team too. Your organization,
[00:41:06] someone has a problem, someone has an issue, someone has a sick kid, someone has a they get sick
[00:41:10] themselves and you take care of them. That's going to help them. It's going to it's going to bring
[00:41:17] your unit closer together. Says your Marines need to recognize that the quicker they take the
[00:41:23] objective, the quicker their fallen comrades get help. Stopping to take care of your fellow
[00:41:28] Marines during the assault will bog down the unit. During the assault Marines cannot stop to
[00:41:34] aid a fallen comrades. The corpsmen will take care of the casualties in the best possible manner
[00:41:38] until you are able to send for help. That's something we learn basically day one, win the fight.
[00:41:45] That's also a prioritized next-cute scenario. That's probably the first prioritized and execute
[00:41:53] thing that I ever learned. You got to win the fight. At the first opportunity leaders and
[00:42:02] comrades should look for casualties every Marine must be accounted for dead and wounded are
[00:42:06] removed from the combat area as soon as possible. And it's got a section here about boredom. In combat,
[00:42:13] the squad leadership fight inactivity and boredom with the same tenacity used against enemy troops.
[00:42:19] That might be a bit strong. Look, I don't want my troops to be bored, but I'm going to be more
[00:42:24] tenacious against the enemy than I am against boredom. The boredom and that inactivity produces
[00:42:30] can negatively impact your squad if they become complacent. When the time comes, when the time
[00:42:34] for combat comes, this inactivity may result in a less effective unit. And there's another thing,
[00:42:41] this one thing that I think is good to think about. If you push somebody, if you're giving
[00:42:49] someone something to do, kind of making almost making it up. Not quite, but like, hey, we're
[00:42:54] going to run this battle drill again. Hey, we're going to do another briefing. Hey, we're going to
[00:42:57] review this. Hey, we're going to maintain our weapons again. If you're doing that kind of stuff,
[00:43:03] you should give them a time for, hey, right now we got an hour, relax. You should give them a
[00:43:10] specific amount of time to stand down, to relax, to take a knee, whatever. I think that is
[00:43:18] important too. If you're trying to keep them busy all the time, that's not smart. You need to find
[00:43:25] a moment to go, okay, hey, we got a half an hour, everybody, take your, take your rock off for
[00:43:30] relax. Yeah, it's so you hear, it says keep your Marines occupied by delivering intelligence briefs
[00:43:39] reviewing the rules of engagement, rehearsing immediate action drills during the walls and pace of
[00:43:43] operations by doing so, so you prevent disciplinary problems by turning your squads, thoughts away from
[00:43:49] themselves to the work at hand. Again, good. Yes, I like it. I agree with it. However, comma,
[00:43:56] you got to give people a little bit of downtime. Is that kind of parallel, whatever, to the idea
[00:44:03] of, okay, so you go to the gym, we'll say, right? So let's say you want to go to the gym after work,
[00:44:10] not before, right, after work. So if you, let's say as a routine, you go from work, you get off work,
[00:44:17] and then you go straight to the gym. That's better. Then going home first, decompressing a little bit,
[00:44:24] then going into the gym, right? You know, I don't know if what you're talking about is the same thing,
[00:44:30] but it's 100% true. I think so though, because they're, you know, when you get like,
[00:44:34] downtime or whatever, like too much downtime, essentially, right? Like where it's not like you have to
[00:44:39] rest in recover from work to go to the gym, unless you do, and that's a whole different thing.
[00:44:43] Yeah. I'm talking about the idea that you come home from your office, you know, and you're physically
[00:44:48] not exhausted, maybe mentally or, but whatever, you go straight to the gym, because you don't
[00:44:53] give your mind, just like I always said, a chance to think about like yourself, like how
[00:45:00] am I feeling that man, the mood, and it's like, it kind of creeps up on you, you know, when you have
[00:45:05] that downtime. But if you go straight to the gym, you're like, hey, we're still, we're still moving,
[00:45:09] you know, you don't get a chance to get that true. That is accurate. And then if you take that to the
[00:45:15] extreme where you also, and you're not going to be rested all the time, then you got to watch out
[00:45:20] for that. Yeah, that's almost like the idea that let's say your job is like super physically demanding.
[00:45:26] Like, you're like, what would you say to drywall hanger or something?
[00:45:29] Drywall hanger is getting after it? Yeah, well, that's one that you said you did,
[00:45:32] well, you know, either way, let's say you did, you know, 11, 12 hours a day. That's for, let's say
[00:45:36] roofers. roofers. Yeah. And hot sun, even. Boom. Okay, go home, take a little snooze or even.
[00:45:43] Then hit the gym. You can be kind of like refreshed little bit. I bet you'd be better off
[00:45:46] just going straight there. Sometimes I think so something. I think there's plenty of people here at
[00:45:51] our gym where they're coming off of a long day of working construction and then it's like right
[00:45:55] on to the mats, you know, I think it's a better move. Well, I would, for me, it's a better move.
[00:46:00] Mentally, it's a better move, I think. Yeah. Physically, you go recover a little bit. That's what I think.
[00:46:07] But you're driving here. You know, you got like half an hour, whatever. That's what I'm saying.
[00:46:11] Mentally, but because when you're driving here, you're thinking about training more than
[00:46:15] you're thinking about relaxing. I'll tell you that. You go home. Have a snack. Turn on the TV.
[00:46:21] Just for a little bit. You're letting the window close. That was the one of the conversations we
[00:46:25] once had was you're letting that window close. Yeah. Oh, let's get a little bit smaller. Oh,
[00:46:30] can't make it. Oh, you know, I got a little too busy. Sometimes my wife will wake up early.
[00:46:34] Yeah. And like, there's that, you know, whatever that gravity of, you know, she's, oh, you know,
[00:46:45] talking to me and stuff. All right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But we have workouts to do. You know?
[00:46:54] Yes. And that's like I'll come back down to the house to like grab some more water or something.
[00:46:58] Mm-hmm. Because I'm in my garage, you know, and then I go back down to like grab some water
[00:47:05] and she's awake. And she's just having a cup of tea because she's from the world. Yeah.
[00:47:10] And she's there. Oh, my one. And there's that gravity, you know,
[00:47:15] kind of wish she honestly no offense to my wife kind of wish she wasn't away. Because I kind of want
[00:47:19] to like hang out with her bed, you know, and I have to not. Oh, yeah. That's real. That's real.
[00:47:23] Even with us when we show up here, whatever we're going to talk about some stuff, you know,
[00:47:28] do this, do that. Yeah. The workout thing, especially with your wife because they're even if you don't
[00:47:33] want to talk to your wife. Mm-hmm. I'm not saying that's my key. Maybe, maybe,
[00:47:40] even either way, even if you don't want to talk to her. I'm pathetic. But that you do. You can't just
[00:47:44] disrespect her and be like, yeah, cool story. I'm busy. She knows what you're doing. You're working
[00:47:49] out. Take a minute. Talk to me on your wife. You know, for better words, all this stuff. And
[00:47:54] you're over here, just disney me for like some curls or whatever you're doing it, you seem
[00:47:58] saying. And that's what it really does feel like when you're doing it. So yeah, I can jam you on.
[00:48:05] Oh, my wife sleeps. I like going, she would. I like when she sleeps a little later. You
[00:48:09] don't get to get to her rest. Yeah, it's a rest. I do get to get some rest. Success and combat. The
[00:48:17] focus of this study unit is to teach you the important factors of leadership so you can
[00:48:21] perform better as a leader in both peace, time and in combat. The way that you respond to these leadership
[00:48:26] challenges is crucial to achieving success and combat factors to success. As an infantry squad leader,
[00:48:35] you control the lives of 12 Marines. They look to you for instruction and guidance. This part is
[00:48:43] important. You're most casual remark will be remembered. You're clothing, vocabulary, and
[00:48:50] method of leadership will be imitated. They're listening and it has impact. When you start making
[00:49:01] little crack and jokes about the LT, those jokes have a lot more impact when they're coming from you
[00:49:07] as a squad leader. The LT, the Lieutenant. Oh, God. When you're cracking jokes about the VP of sales,
[00:49:14] your little sales team is that those have more impact than you think. This is something I
[00:49:22] was had to be careful to. When I went from being maybe it's even to this day. When I went
[00:49:28] from being an E5 and a Poutune E5 mafia where everybody is a target. Everybody in the entire
[00:49:34] chain of command is a target for ridicule. And then all of a sudden when I became an officer,
[00:49:41] assistant, Poutune Commander, Poutune Commander, I had to freaking dial that back. You just can't
[00:49:47] be going drop a Napalm on that chain of command over every little thing. And it's tempting because
[00:49:53] it's funny and that's what you're used to. I had to dial that back. Lafel was cracks up when I
[00:49:59] go like go E5 on somebody. I start dropping the hammer on someone. Yeah. Hey, this is a side note case.
[00:50:07] So you always talk about that like the E5. It's like a thing. Yeah. E5 mafia. And I've heard of
[00:50:14] E4. I think in the E6 of course. What's with E5? That sounds to me that sounds pretty high.
[00:50:22] Like there's E1 right? Is there any one? Yeah there's E1 but you're not a new one for very long.
[00:50:27] You're like in boot camp, you're new one. You're probably going to make E2 out of boot camp. E3
[00:50:31] you should be pretty much you know within maybe I don't know a year. Yeah. Then you're E4. So now
[00:50:37] you could be E4 for like a few a couple years, you know maybe two or three years. So you're
[00:50:43] you may or may not have done the deployment. And this is also back in the day. Guys make
[00:50:47] rank faster now than we did. So back in the day, the E6 was a leadership position. E5 was the
[00:50:59] boys and the new guys were kind of E4s. Maybe even E3s occasionally. So essentially I don't think
[00:51:06] there's an E3 in a seal puttune today at all. I don't think there is. I think there's barely any
[00:51:13] E4s. It's mostly E5s and now you have multiple E6s in a puttune. But back in the day,
[00:51:18] an E6 was an LPO. He was the leading patty officer. Then you had a chief patty officer. Then you had
[00:51:24] this as a puttune commander and a puttune commander. So you had those were the senior people. We
[00:51:29] called him the top four. And then you had new guys. You had four or five new guys, which were
[00:51:35] probably E3s. No, they were probably E4s maybe and E3. And then you had the group in the middle.
[00:51:41] And these were the E5 mob. So they were there at not when you say they're E6's leadership position.
[00:51:49] So E5 is not only like they're not anyone's boss. They're just they're just now they might be one
[00:51:56] per- they might be a new guys boss. Like when I was an E5 mobster, I had an E4. That was a new guy
[00:52:01] that was a radio man. Yeah. You see what I was saying? Yeah. I'm trying to try and
[00:52:06] draw a comparison. And actually part of the time I was an E5 mobfie. I was an E4. Because I didn't
[00:52:11] make E5 very rapidly. So yeah. But that E5 mobfie is like the people that are doing the
[00:52:19] work. Right. Like when you were a balancer, how many balancers were there?
[00:52:23] Uh, I don't know. 15. Okay. This is it. Now one of them was in charge, right? Yeah. Maybe two of them.
[00:52:29] Hey, this guy's in charge of the shuffling. So those guys are in charge of the Zip. Then you had a couple
[00:52:35] like new guys at kind of Soctr or whatever. Yeah. But then you had a core group of guys that kind of
[00:52:40] if you could say something, people are going to have to listen. Yeah. There you go. That's three five
[00:52:44] off. Yeah. You know what it was? And now that I'm thinking of it, it's, there's the door guys. They're all
[00:52:49] called door guys. But the guys who worked the front door, which is usually the one and two. And then
[00:52:54] like kind of a guy who would switch out. Someone who's doing well. But then there's the rest of the
[00:53:00] guys who worked, you know, inside. And then yes, there were like new guys who were like still learning
[00:53:05] like camera. Yeah. Who, yes. And kind of the same thing where you could tell them, hey, go change the
[00:53:12] toilet paper in the bathroom. Yeah. You know, like go do the worst. Yeah. Exactly. Right. So yeah,
[00:53:16] I get, I got you. Yeah. But you five is kind of high in those. What I'm saying. It's like,
[00:53:21] well, I can tell, no, it's not kind of high. But in a seal platoon, you're a men level. But you're
[00:53:29] kind of just a shooter too. You know, you don't, you're not one of the top four. So it's not like
[00:53:36] kind of high. And right now, everybody, I think I think everybody in the seal teams right now is
[00:53:41] an E5. If you make it through Buds, I think you'd be culmining E5. It's kind of legit, you know,
[00:53:47] back in the day, because I know that's all right, brother. You're an E3. You're an E4.
[00:53:51] Back in the day, if you want to ship in your E3, you had to work in the dishwasher for three months.
[00:53:58] And we did one to point, we had an E3 in our platoon. And we somehow got him out of it.
[00:54:02] Got him out of doing that. But I was an E4 for my second platoon. So even though I should have been
[00:54:10] an E5 or I was an E5 mafia, but even then even in that platoon,
[00:54:17] there's a bunch of E4s. And we were on the E5 mafia. It's an E stand for enlisted. And then if you're an
[00:54:23] officer, it's an O. So you got O1, that's an instant. O2 is a lieutenant junior grade. See, that's weird.
[00:54:29] I've never heard of O anything. All I heard was E. I think I've even heard of E1, E233. Yeah,
[00:54:35] because people talk smack about the O. That guy's an E1. And then you become in the navy, O3 is
[00:54:45] lieutenant. And then O4 is lieutenant commander. But in the army, that same rank is called a major.
[00:54:53] So when in Ramadi, the army guys, they would a lot of army guys was called the major. So then
[00:55:01] some of the, some of my guys would call me the mage. And then captain is it very high or it is
[00:55:11] captain in the army and the Marine Corps is an O4. Captain, or sorry, is an O3 in the army and the
[00:55:19] Marine Corps, which is a company commander in charge of 150 guys. Captain in the navy is much higher.
[00:55:29] It's an O6. And they could be in charge of multiple ships. So a captain in the navy is
[00:55:38] much higher rank than a captain in the army or the Marine Corps. A captain in the navy is a
[00:55:44] Colonel, a full bird. You ever heard that expression? Probably in the movies. You hear that full
[00:55:48] bird. So a full bird, Colonel, which means they have an eagle on their collar is a full
[00:55:56] captain. You don't really say full bird captain because you don't need to. Because the
[00:56:00] wood region you say that is in the army and the Marine Corps, you could be a lieutenant
[00:56:04] Colonel, which still has a silver oak leaf, which makes you a lieutenant Colonel. So if someone's
[00:56:10] got the full bird, that's why you, because you can still call someone that's a lieutenant Colonel,
[00:56:14] you might just call him Colonel. Because you know, it's a big mouthful to say Colonel.
[00:56:19] Or sorry, it's a big mouthful to say lieutenant Colonel. Hey, lieutenant Colonel, what are we
[00:56:22] doing? But if you say hey Colonel, that's totally acceptable. So we want to let your boys know like,
[00:56:26] hey, this guy's a full bird. Colonel, they deal. Got that full bird. Colonel, coming in.
[00:56:32] Yeah, I understand why I understand now why I was so unclear about everything. Because it's like
[00:56:39] the same words. Different, you know, armies different than the navy and it's but same words,
[00:56:44] you know. Well, sometimes life and Seth would get called captain by army guys, by
[00:56:50] mary because that's, you see those two bars like, oh, that's a captain. If you're the army,
[00:56:53] that's a captain. Yeah. So you're not thinking lieutenant because the lieutenant is a lower rank.
[00:57:01] All right, this section breaks out two things. There are two fundamental types of factors that
[00:57:07] affect success and combat. One, factors over which you have a little or no influence that you
[00:57:13] must try to understand, endure and explain to your Marines. And number two, factors that you can
[00:57:20] influence directly through your leadership. And it goes into a bunch of things. Well, that's
[00:57:29] you can't, that you have a little to know influence, political guidelines and rules of engagement,
[00:57:32] a valuable ability and quality of replacement, location, weather terrain, public reaction and
[00:57:38] support, type of conflict, enemy action, duration. You know, control, I'm very little control over
[00:57:43] those things. And it goes into talking about the political guidelines,
[00:57:49] did what your responsible, making sure your Marines abide by them. Here's an important part
[00:57:54] of the say, past the chain of command information that might be useful in correcting deficiencies
[00:57:58] with rules of engagement procedures. So if you've got some rule of engagement that doesn't
[00:58:03] make sense, you are responsible for sending that up chain of command. And by the way, if you work
[00:58:08] in a factory and there's some part of the manufacturing line that doesn't make sense, you are
[00:58:14] responsible for running that up the chain so it can get corrected. Little control over who's going
[00:58:23] to replace you, obviously, no control, very little control over location terrain, weather.
[00:58:30] So it, it list goes into a little bit of detail, well, all those things. And then it goes into
[00:58:35] factors that you can influence morale, motivation, discipline, or, pre-decor proficiency.
[00:58:45] Morales, the mental and emotional condition, enthusiasm, confidence, or loyalty of an individual
[00:58:52] or group with regard to the functions or tasks at hand, the squad leader who taps into this
[00:58:56] valuable resource and keeps it to the forefront throughout the adverse conditions of combat will
[00:59:03] always prevail. That's a strong word always. Motivation is a by-product of morale.
[00:59:12] If your Marines are enthusiastic about being part of the squad and have confidence in their squad
[00:59:16] leader, then they will have the incentive to drive on through adversity.
[00:59:24] Discipline. Discipline is defined in the dictionary as quote to bring under control.
[00:59:31] In combat, we speak of discipline. In troops, we speak of the Marines ability to disregard
[00:59:38] the natural tendencies of self-preservation and at times put them in a harm's way if necessary.
[00:59:46] And I would expand on this right now, but they expand on this in a beautiful way.
[00:59:49] I'll talk about discipline in a beautiful way coming up. That's pretty cool as the unit spirit
[00:59:55] describes how devoted and loyalty are to the team. Proficiency, proficiency is being
[01:00:00] knowledgeable and skillful in your craft. The imagine a unit being so confident in their ability
[01:00:04] to perform that it affects all of the aforementioned factors. Now you have our unit ready to fight.
[01:00:10] morale and motivation is the cornerstone of discipline.
[01:00:14] Spread your core and proficiency if you instill high morale and motivation in your Marines,
[01:00:20] this can lead to success in combat. morale makes up three quarters of the game.
[01:00:26] The relative balance of manpower makes up only the remaining quarter. That's the pulling
[01:00:31] bone apart. morale makes up three quarters of the game in combat.
[01:00:39] You know, that's one of those ones you go, well, yeah, because if you're thinking,
[01:00:43] you know, you're football team against another football team and they have great morale,
[01:00:47] but you guys are better players, right? Well, it's probably not going to work out too well.
[01:00:52] But because this is what I was thinking about last time, I said, well, you know,
[01:00:56] where's that going to really carry you in a football game? But then I thought, what if you
[01:01:01] won't if your football game was played for months? You see what I'm saying? And it wasn't about
[01:01:07] how big and strong you were, but it was about, hey, we're going to be, we're going to maneuver
[01:01:11] faster than you. We're going to walk further than you. We're going to keep working while you're
[01:01:15] resting. Like the, we're going to keep our weapons clean. Like all those things, like that's how
[01:01:20] you win and all those things have to do with morale. So it might not make a sense in a short
[01:01:25] engagement in a physical game. It can have an impact. For sure, I would almost say you were right
[01:01:34] to begin with in a football game as far as the example. I mean, you're ready the way, but
[01:01:39] if your morale is low, the other team is high, but you have a better football team,
[01:01:45] your morale is going to be low for a reason. Like, based essentially like, oh, you know, it's like
[01:01:49] there's going to be in low morale. It's going to be a lack of confidence. I'm sure there's going to be
[01:01:53] a lack of motivation and a corner to book lack of proficiency, which negatively affects your morale.
[01:01:58] So you know, you're not that good your morale is about exactly right. So like I said, it's for a
[01:02:01] reason. So their morale is good. What if like every your morale, if you're better, quote unquote,
[01:02:06] better football team is going to be for a reason. And then whatever that reason is, I don't know,
[01:02:09] it's your hypothetical. I don't know, but think of a realistic one. Maybe people are arguing about
[01:02:14] this and that. So they're not working together as a team. Both the morale on the team itself,
[01:02:18] like what can hurt the morale. Exactly. Right. On the better quote unquote team. Yeah, like you
[01:02:23] like you boo a game. Like you boo the last game, like you shouldn't miss the field goal. And you
[01:02:27] did and you were better team than them. But then they won, morale could be down. Yeah. And you're arguing
[01:02:32] with your team, quarterback is blaming everyone. They, you know, maybe they're best guys injured. And
[01:02:36] that, you know, now everyone's not as confident and like maybe they're starting, you know,
[01:02:41] all this other stuff and they're tired because they've been drinking, you know, all this stuff.
[01:02:45] So technically there's, I'm just saying that's a big factor. So so technically they,
[01:02:50] they are maybe a better team. But the morale is so low for these were specific reasons. The
[01:02:54] other guys have been working hard. They've been got a strategy in place, a secret strategy. I
[01:02:59] told you about this one time this team was we were technically better than them, but they were
[01:03:02] like saying, oh, we're going to kick their ass. We're going to kick their ass. And they're telling
[01:03:06] the whole island, essentially, we're going to kick their ass out. What was this was this high school?
[01:03:09] Yeah. And I was like, what the, this is uncanny the way they're saying this so much, you know,
[01:03:14] and then, but they had a little plan and they did, they beat us to with the plan. It was to do
[01:03:21] these weird quarterback keep plays with no huddle. So it's just essentially that that surprise
[01:03:28] kind of thing and then just keep going going. So they'd go quarterback keep and we kind of stop
[01:03:33] it and they go, no huddle quarterback keep and be like, oh, we're scrambling and we kind of stop it,
[01:03:37] but they gave in a little bit more and they just kept doing it kept doing it for the whole, but
[01:03:41] didn't you figure out a solution for it after they did it for seven or nine times? I think I was
[01:03:46] a two-way. I think our morale went down in that first flurry to be honest with you. I forget how
[01:03:51] it's of their morale was high. Very high. They actually beat you. Yeah. For that reason, I'm always surprised
[01:03:56] in football that there's not more sneakiness. Yeah. I think a lot of sneakiness, I feel like we
[01:04:03] might have talked about this. We've put both of this so much history behind the way plays work
[01:04:08] that sneakiness usually comes with an element of risk that's equal. So yeah, if you do this
[01:04:15] trick play, there's teams that sort of land towards more sneakiness, but they land more towards
[01:04:21] a risk as well. So like one of the mainstream sneaky plays is called the reverse, where it's like
[01:04:27] you give the ball, this many ways to do it, but a standard one would be you give the ball to the
[01:04:31] running back and an outside run. And instead of keeping running the wider Siever who's wherever
[01:04:35] there he comes around this way. So he's acting like he's running and he gets it to the wider Siever
[01:04:38] going the other way. So the defense says all this momentum going this way with the ball and the
[01:04:42] reverse just comes around with but he's a single guy because he'd have had no blockers. If you
[01:04:48] had blockers, everyone would see the blockers going over there and they'd be like oh wait, this isn't
[01:04:51] you know this so they'd be the rest being that if somebody picks it up and reads it play, then he's
[01:04:54] getting annihilated. Probably behind the line because he has no blockers exactly right or what's the one
[01:05:00] the um just like a hook and lateral which is a big risk on now and then a pass back to the
[01:05:08] quarterback that's another one. We're like you give it to the running back and he runs and he doesn't
[01:05:12] go past the line. The quarterback does. And the quarterback runs around the other side on a pass pattern
[01:05:18] essentially a research so he goes down and then now the running back has to throw the ball to the
[01:05:24] quarterback which is huge risk by the way, brother, they're going to pick that thing. And the quarterback
[01:05:28] got to catch it. Got to catch it. Yes to be open by the way because if he's not open,
[01:05:32] he's going to throw it to undunth their wider sheeper usually it's like you know it's like you put your
[01:05:36] eggs all in one basket a lot of time and then nowadays people are kind of hip to trick plays so they
[01:05:42] kind of wait for it to develop and now the risk goes up you know so that's probably why. I'm sure
[01:05:47] back in the in fact your walk back in the day like 1940s well that's all kinds of weird
[01:05:52] plays. Yeah so morale you guys lost the other puttune team was hyped on the morale you
[01:06:02] morale was immediately crushed and then you were all embarrassed then you lost. So even even in football
[01:06:09] it can be morale can be um three quarters of the game. Yeah I think so. It says morale is the
[01:06:16] confident resolute willing and often self sacrificing and courageous attitude of a marine to
[01:06:22] accomplish the tasks expected by the squad. morale is based upon pride in the achievement and aims
[01:06:29] of the squad faith and you as a squad leader a sense of participation in the squad's work,
[01:06:34] devotion and loyalty to the other members of the squad confidence in the ultimate success of the squad.
[01:06:40] Whichever army goes into battle stronger in soul their enemies generally cannot withstand them
[01:06:50] that's the Greek warrior's xenophon more than 2000 years ago. morale tends to fluctuate
[01:06:58] even among the best Marines. It must be your constant concern because this is the foundation of
[01:07:05] discipline you must recognize the extreme importance morale has to the combat effectiveness of your squad.
[01:07:13] Marine tents are a morale tends to fluctuate even amongst the best Marines that's something
[01:07:19] it's important to know. I'll tell you it's a fact it it fluctuates less. It can fluctuate but
[01:07:26] man you get some some motivated troopers it's hard even it's hard even bring them down a little bit
[01:07:34] there is in the game and they help everybody it's so helpful to have somebody kind of motivated in
[01:07:40] the game like somebody with high morale like we got this and it kind of takes someone who can
[01:07:47] deal with adversity right yeah so and I was thinking which by the way is a decision yeah I know
[01:07:53] and it's a great decision too yeah you can be like look I know what's happening right now I can
[01:07:58] see what's happening I can see the negativity start to drag down and you can say they will I'm
[01:08:05] not letting this happen on me and you get crazy so but that guy who's getting crazy and you're
[01:08:12] he has to be kind of used to adversity one where another or at the very least know how to deal with it
[01:08:17] that sort of yes so so it kind of brought me back a little bit to the two conversation we had recently
[01:08:22] about guys quitting who you whatever maybe where you would think no way that's going to
[01:08:27] quit because he's he's a stud but this guy is probably not you get in you know in MMA and
[01:08:34] you're somewhere whatever in Dick Marseynco's book recently died the rogue warrior
[01:08:41] he wrote a book came out 1992 when I was a new guy in the dirt but he called these people gazelles
[01:08:49] yes yeah and he said gazelles they they're used to winning they're run they run they win and
[01:08:56] they run they win and they're just good athletes and they're just winning winning winning
[01:08:59] and they show up of buds and I can promise you there's gonna be some shit you loose
[01:09:05] and if that's you get that adversity wall and you've been a stud your whole life and all the
[01:09:12] sudden I'm sure there's multiple psychological things that can unfold one of them might be
[01:09:19] you're used to winning and now you lose and you get down there's something but also hey
[01:09:23] this is the hardest thing I've ever done it's harder than I thought it was going to be
[01:09:27] or I failed this thing and now what's gonna happen if I failed this thing and I'm only two days
[01:09:32] into this gig I got six more months of this and I already failed no I'm not cut out for this
[01:09:39] totally not used to it it's totally like an imposition on their whole sensibility and that's just
[01:09:45] how just not used to it but so you could in a way kind of track it back to morale really that
[01:09:50] way that that that individuals morale gets crushed exactly right like crap so you get a guy
[01:09:56] who's used to adversity he's like hey this won't crush my morale I've been here before I know
[01:10:00] I can fight back out of this I know this is gonna end I know the you know guys who know
[01:10:03] like adversity but the guy who doesn't the guy who wins every single time never failed ever
[01:10:09] in his thing you know just and just things come natural to him oh bro you like like I get crushed one
[01:10:14] time yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that might be this the situation on the one
[01:10:20] Kobe so morale is kind of because in the beginning you'd think morale that's just you have
[01:10:25] an abad attitude about stuff your morale is low like if they oh hey the morale is bad you know
[01:10:31] I don't have you you kind of on the surface it kind of comes off is that like Brad just I don't
[01:10:38] know fire yourself up like basically like make a decision to have a better attitude when you think
[01:10:43] about this the the buds when I was going through buds they would say false motivation is better than
[01:10:49] no motivation yeah I got to agree with it yeah you know yeah you know like you hear someone
[01:10:55] start getting fired up whether they're faking or not it's like hey that guy seems to be still
[01:10:59] let's go rock and roll yeah exactly right and that's it and you know like you guys will say like hey
[01:11:05] if you have like the the note bad team's only bad leaders right the bow cruise right where you get a
[01:11:09] guy who's coos like hey it's all good guys we're gonna do this and he's kind of
[01:11:13] motivating everybody even if they were kind of like beat down they're morale kind of gets
[01:11:20] gets more high on the academy online the other day I was talking about how you frame things up
[01:11:26] and this is a skill that you can attain over time but if you gave viewer my boss and you gave
[01:11:34] me the worst assignment ever by the time I'm telling the team I frame that thing up in a totally
[01:11:41] different way it is not the worst job it's a challenge it's an opportunity to look awesome
[01:11:47] we're gonna do better never it's like I'm gonna frame things up all day long in an uplifting
[01:11:52] morale moment yeah I'm definitely not framing something up as bad like we're gonna frame this up
[01:12:01] and the thing is it's not a lie it's the truth I can't you can't lie to your team you can't
[01:12:06] lie to him and be like well hey everyone this is gonna be great we just hey everyone we we
[01:12:12] got to work this weekend aren't you excited you know if you've just been out in the field for two
[01:12:17] weeks and then you get back and the boss says hey you're gonna do a dog and pony this weekend what

[01:13:07] like math you can't be like no math is fun but you just like that's a lot in there for you there
[01:13:13] that's okay I can really relate to you at all I can't imagine my trust level is going down
[01:13:18] right like even a five-year-old knows that this is not fun right there's a rare person that
[01:13:24] thinks is fun but it's like one in a billion freaking Lex Friedman just got fired up look at
[01:13:30] a problem he's six years old he's like oh hell yeah right me not happening Lex good to go
[01:13:37] you need a better frame up on now yeah like Lex framed it up in his mind that's his good
[01:13:41] frame yeah yeah but yeah you know but when you say hey when you get good at this right here's
[01:13:46] gonna make you smarter yeah this is you're gonna be able to dominate you're not got to worry about
[01:13:51] school when you're dominant math you gotta learn this problem and people like I'm like
[01:13:55] I can dominate here do alright characteristics of morale major general William slim
[01:14:05] quoted by John Masters in the road pass the road pass mandalaia provides an example of how
[01:14:12] morale can be affected in combat can't some of these these things are really good quote
[01:14:20] we have already trained or meant to the highest possible level of skill with their weapons and in
[01:14:24] the use of minor tactics but in the end every important battle develops to a point where there is
[01:14:32] no real control by senior commanders every soldier feels himself to be alone discipline may have
[01:14:40] got him to the place where he is and discipline may hold him there for a time cooperation with other
[01:14:48] men in the same situation can help move him forward self preservation will make him defend himself to
[01:14:54] the death if there's no other way but what makes him go on alone determine to break the will of the
[01:15:02] enemy opposite him is morale pride in himself as an independent thinking man who knows why he's there
[01:15:12] and what he's doing absolute confidence that the best has been done for him and that his fate is
[01:15:19] now in his own hands the dominant feeling on the battlefield is loneliness gentlemen and morale
[01:15:27] only morale individual morale as a foundation under training and discipline will bring victory
[01:15:35] and that's see that's what's important what what I read this a couple times what's important here
[01:15:46] is to remember that as the leader you're the one that's developing their morale you're bringing
[01:15:51] together that unit you're training them to the utmost you're in your in part you're imparting this
[01:15:57] the benefits of self discipline you're rewarding those things and you build this creature this
[01:16:04] beast that has this morale that's so strong that they're not going down here's some specific
[01:16:17] indicators of morale response to shortages care of equipment and weapons rumors excessive
[01:16:24] quarreling you brought that one up early with the football team personal hygiene standards of military
[01:16:30] courtesy personal parents personal conduct so like the the response sources how do they respond
[01:16:37] we hate we're almost out of water oh my god we're all going to die you know the movie aliens
[01:16:43] yes we're all going to die out here man right because there's a shortage of whatever
[01:16:48] we don't know if any backups coming you're all going to die that's bad morale it's a bad
[01:16:53] morale that's essentially the beginning of the end yeah so it's kind of like the end of the rope kind of a
[01:16:59] thing of course you can turn it around but bro it's the beginning of the end oh no it's kind of a critical factor
[01:17:06] when there's when there it says this you're in the running when you're running low on whatever on on
[01:17:12] equipment or food or water it says the squad with high morale and strong unicohesion will divide
[01:17:16] what is available and become an even stronger outfit because of it the unit does that does not have
[01:17:21] this quality is not acting cohesively as a team it will disintegrate quickly failure to properly
[01:17:30] maintain equipment and weapons and to get that a Marine does not care is becoming excessively
[01:17:34] fatigued or is lost all discipline on the other hand if you fail to provide the means to keep
[01:17:41] your Marines gear properly maintained you can rule them around you got rumors clearly there's a
[01:17:48] lack of information you you need to tell your team what's going on otherwise you're going to make it up
[01:17:54] and it's not going to be good cooperation mutual trust and confidence in one another's ability
[01:18:03] can be adversely affected when your Marines quarrel amongst themselves excessive corling is a
[01:18:08] sign that something is wrong and must be fixed I was going to say this is like a chicken or an egg thing
[01:18:13] like when things start going bad people start to argue and when people start to argue things
[01:18:21] start going bad I guess it's a downward spiral I don't know which one starts first chicken to the egg
[01:18:26] but when you start hearing people arguing amongst themselves if you're going to have problems and it's not going to
[01:18:30] get better keeping it you know keeping it clean as far as hygiene goes says regardless of how
[01:18:45] miserable the circumstances may actually be we must do we can to make conditions habitable
[01:18:51] let's talk about this standards of military courtesy units that have pride in confidence in
[01:18:55] their leaders maintain high standards of military courtesy at all times changes show that poor
[01:19:01] discipline and lack of respect to may indicate loma Ra keeping it professional it's interesting
[01:19:11] that they talk about standards of military courtesy but if you want to translate that to
[01:19:17] the civilian world you want to translate it to your family it's how you treat each other
[01:19:21] because sure the Marine Corps of salute means you know I respect you or calling you sure whatever
[01:19:26] staying attention all those things but when you're a civilian if you want to
[01:19:34] keep your teams morale high even when things are going sideways you don't yell at your team
[01:19:40] you treat them with respect you ask them what their ideas are you know like that's what you do
[01:19:44] so treating people with respect is a way to maintain high morale it says this about personal
[01:19:52] conduct moodiness solidness quiet withdrawal or any sudden unexplainable change in one of your
[01:19:58] Marines behavior may indicate that something is wrong and there's cause for a concern that's a way
[01:20:05] you're acting now listen does that mean you want to be polyana and have a big smile on your face
[01:20:12] hey guys we're about to be overrun yay like no that's not what we're talking about hey I'm going
[01:20:16] to have to fire a bunch of people from our company no but going into that listen it's it's
[01:20:24] it's interesting that they say this solineness and quiet withdrawal and moodiness so none of those say
[01:20:32] be happy they don't say that none of them say jump for joy but if you're acting solin
[01:20:38] if you're if you if you if you withdraw if you have an unexplain change in your behavior man
[01:20:47] being consistent is so important from a leadership perspective that's why you know it's getting
[01:20:52] interviewed a little while ago and they were asked asking me about resiliency and I kind of said that
[01:21:00] this was this was Travis minion sister Ryan and she was she was she's got a podcast about resiliency
[01:21:06] and I was on it and she was asking me about resiliency and I was like I don't think too much about it
[01:21:13] and I think it's kind of a little bit natural for me to be resilient and I shouldn't have said
[01:21:17] natural or maybe I didn't say it but that's the feeling I get but what I ultimately said was listen
[01:21:22] I feel like I'm fairly resilient cause I don't have low lows and the reason I don't have low lows
[01:21:29] cause I don't have high highs I'm not getting all excited but yay no I'm not doing that but I'm
[01:21:34] awesome like oh no I'm not doing anything one of those two things I'm staying in a limited emotional
[01:21:40] box we're not getting too crazy with a victory and I'm not getting too crazy with a defeat
[01:21:46] so I think that's this that lines up very well with this if you're if you're the person that
[01:21:53] shows how happy you are everybody's used to that and now when you start being sad they're going to
[01:21:58] all of geez echoes all bummed out something's wrong yeah or even not as happy like if you know
[01:22:04] these guys are super fired up and then you know something cool happens and they're like yeah
[01:22:09] right on and they're not as fired up you're like oh something's wrong even though they essentially
[01:22:13] express happiness just not enough he ever kind of back to the the professionalism and you know
[01:22:22] they're talking about in the military like okay so what is your wife call you normally
[01:22:28] darling darling not you buy your name huh not generally yeah I'm barely ever actually yeah
[01:22:33] my neither and I don't really call her by her name that much it's some other stuff we don't have
[01:22:38] to go into it but I don't want to hear the name sometimes if I call her by the name she'll be
[01:22:44] like don't call me by my name like kind of have joking you know because it kind of sounds but also what
[01:22:49] if what if she what if you were downstairs and she was like echo right exactly right or if
[01:22:54] we're going through some things or in some sort of almost like argument or whatever like yeah she won't
[01:22:59] chill thankfully it's been multiple multiple multiple years it's sensing anything like that but
[01:23:06] even then let's say you're on bad terms with your wife and usually she calls you I don't know
[01:23:11] darling babe whatever they call you call each other and then they call you your name you kind of
[01:23:17] it's like a little assault on your scent like kind of like oh there's something wrong so when
[01:23:21] morale is down boom you can that part breaks down a little bit a little bit disrespectful yeah
[01:23:27] yeah so that's that's it that's why consistency and keeping yourself in check and making sure
[01:23:35] that you're not allowing these emotions to creep out and cause people to look at you and think
[01:23:43] of echo is really concerned right now this is things are going bad echo is all but soul and right
[01:23:49] now things that's good what's going to spread yeah that's going to affect the morale of everybody
[01:23:55] what's with that with calling someone who you know good by their legitimate name
[01:24:03] that it's you know how like okay so in the family you know the old thing or if they call you
[01:24:07] like the parent calls the kid by their first and last name oh yeah you know that I mean they're
[01:24:11] in trouble like that kind of stuff yeah what is that I think it's because of what we're saying right now
[01:24:16] I think it's like a step up in in in lack of affection yeah it's like almost the opposite you know
[01:24:25] in a small tiny way where it's like the better terms were on the more loose I'm going to be
[01:24:29] with what I call you'll call you more like fun stuff you know I'll call you by a nickname or a fun
[01:24:34] name or a pet name whatever you call it and then when things are bad okay now you're kind of
[01:24:39] reduced to your legitimate name your official name okay let me ask you this tangental but
[01:24:47] if you ever hear people when they use your name a lot when they're talking to you yeah it's weird right
[01:24:53] it's weird it's weird it's like we're trying to establish a weird salesy type like thing where I know
[01:24:58] you you know echo like I don't think I've other than saying good evening echo I don't think
[01:25:06] you're ever that you're able to this podcast because that's a little weird right yeah I mean and
[01:25:10] even when you do you see my first and my last name within which indicates like a small like it's
[01:25:14] like humor like a joke almost sure yeah exactly right but even you'll be like you echo
[01:25:20] trowels like it's a joke you know where I do say some names on this specific podcast is if someone
[01:25:26] else is here and we're having a three-way conversation I might say like well if I was to say to
[01:25:30] you hey Mike or I might say well that's right you know Fred because I want everyone that's listening
[01:25:37] to know that I was saying that to Fred yeah but that's different and what your tongue is different
[01:25:41] it is I've always it seems a little bit strange it seems like something you would learn at like a
[01:25:48] like a a mastermind sales course to like touch them on the shoulder and tell say their name
[01:25:55] a bunch that I feel closer to you doesn't do that for me if you're trying to sell me something
[01:25:59] don't say my name because it's probably gonna like send me the other direction yeah it's not natural
[01:26:04] like it doesn't feel natural but some people that's just how that's just how they talk yeah but
[01:26:08] I think that's because they've been ingrained to do that I don't think it's normal yeah
[01:26:14] almost like it's like overly professional almost yeah that's the thing echo is when you're
[01:26:19] inside it's weird echo all right so I'm that I confirm that it is really if you listen to
[01:26:34] podcast you can hear people do that sometimes listen to podcast you hear someone saying
[01:26:40] you know it's like right it's kind of strange yes but she wanted to one there the only yeah yeah
[01:26:46] where the only was here echo it's more of your story up that joke in five attempts if you're
[01:26:53] scolding someone then it then it rolls up that's true like I bet you some of those scolding
[01:26:58] videos that we have of you and me I probably use your name more often than not I think I'll use your
[01:27:02] name oh right because you're not scolding you just try to make fun okay I think on a knife I remember
[01:27:08] a appearances if a marine begins to look sloppy a behavioral problem may be the cause likewise
[01:27:16] if conditions prevent your marines from washing shaving or obtaining clean uniform for prolonged
[01:27:20] periods morale can drop this is one of those things where again in the business world
[01:27:29] some the hey here's our dress code hey we got a presentation you're going to get just a look sharp
[01:27:36] smart move smart move hey and I can tell you I'm not one of these people that is going out
[01:27:43] in getting whatever whatever a tailor to make my suit or whatever in fact I don't really like wearing
[01:27:50] suits at all sometimes fighters wear suits have you noticed that why is that the box no no no
[01:27:56] I'm not sure I'm not gonna UFC yeah I know but it kind of it felt the feels like it came from the
[01:28:02] old school of the box yeah I feel like I might be disconnected like and wrong or whatever you know
[01:28:09] like I look at a box I look at a fighter and they're putting a suit and tie on to go to a press conference
[01:28:14] yeah I feel like in a million years I wouldn't have done that but I do think there's kind of
[01:28:19] two camps on that and then there's a rare few that are kind of in between where some some guys
[01:28:23] they that's their jam they were suit because they're a conical sophisticated professional and
[01:28:29] that or that's the image and then there's guys like Nick Diaz who's you know just as good
[01:28:35] you're not better than everyone who probably never wear a suit so it's I think there's two camps
[01:28:40] sure definitely two camps I fall into Nate Diaz camp on that one this is just going to
[01:28:45] knit T-shirt to the press conference probably showing up late yeah yeah you could show them
[01:28:51] yeah but you're like that in real life too though where you know you you probably gonna wear
[01:28:57] slippers or flip flops as we call them here and shorts and a shirt unless you have to wear
[01:29:03] something else yeah that's true so watch out for that with your people that's what that's a kind
[01:29:09] of a classic thing too though right like even in the movies where it's like if they want to indicate
[01:29:13] visually that this guy has just let himself go his morale is down he's down and now what he's
[01:29:18] be on shaving yeah his clothes marimina be dirty like that kind you know type yeah
[01:29:24] uh characters six of motivation motivation answers the question why do marines fight motivation
[01:29:30] is based on a psychological factors such as knees desires and impulses that cause a person
[01:29:35] act for a marine commitment and pride in the unit and the core is generally the basis for combat
[01:29:43] motivation I was when I was starting to read this chapter I was like thinking about the fact that
[01:29:48] I always say motivation no factor because motivation is a feeling it's fickle comes and goes
[01:29:55] and then I because thinking okay well how one of the how are they gonna talk about this
[01:29:59] and there you go and I've talked about this on the podcast motivation is why you're doing something
[01:30:05] and it's important to understand the why a motor video marine will do what needs to be done
[01:30:09] and will know the right thing to do with effective leadership and attentive concern for maintaining
[01:30:14] high morale motivation will also be high however motivation is much more than just an indicator of
[01:30:19] morale is a key element that must be understood by everyone in your squad in combat motivation has
[01:30:25] special significant to marines SEC Smith's US Marine Corps and World War II provides an illustration
[01:30:33] of this motivation quote in a foxhole in the center of the tenuous line he had done much to hold
[01:30:44] PFC John Errance an able company automatic rifleman lay quietly his eyes closed breathing slowly
[01:30:54] Errance was covered with blood he was dying next to him lady dead jasmine japanese sergeant
[01:31:04] and flung across his legs a dead japanese officer
[01:31:07] Errance had been hit in the chest twice by bullets and blood weld slowly from three deep puncture wounds
[01:31:14] inflected by bayonets around his foxhole sprawled 13 crumpled japanese bodies
[01:31:26] as captain Louis W. Walt gathered Errance into his arms to carry him to the residency
[01:31:32] the dying man still clinging to his BAR said captain they tried to come over me last night
[01:31:41] but I don't think they made it they didn't Johnny Walt softly replied they didn't
[01:31:52] end quote
[01:31:52] on the echoes on the say what will motivate your marines to flight fight like pfc erans
[01:32:03] what causes them to have this measure of tenacity and the ability to continue to fight when others
[01:32:09] would give up
[01:32:10] numerous distortions sociologists and psychologists have studied behavior under fire and
[01:32:23] effort to under to find out why we fight as we do and explaining what motivates marines to
[01:32:28] per severe and battle many experts have concluded that the following facts are significant
[01:32:33] unique cohesion tradition commitment aggression patriots is in rewards and punishment social
[01:32:38] identity in the unique cohesion section it says cohesion is perhaps the most powerful
[01:32:50] motivational factoring combat common experiences and shared hardship stimulate and foster
[01:32:55] closeness among individuals as a unit the result in a unit that is able to maintain tactical
[01:33:03] cohesion and achieve success in combat if your marines know their mission it is their
[01:33:08] faith in you and their fellow marines that will carry them over the top charging into the teeth the
[01:33:13] enemy
[01:33:16] this is a I'll get asked a lot about you know how do you bring a team together it's a
[01:33:20] kick out of do hard things together so it's one thing that's cool about the ftx program that we
[01:33:25] run it's it's challenging it is mentally challenging there's actually almost no physical challenge
[01:33:31] so that's not what I'm talking about it is mentally challenging and you will
[01:33:36] you will get put in situations where you have to make very tough decisions under pressure
[01:33:42] and when you get to do it yourself and you watch someone else do it and they do a call or bad
[01:33:47] call or good call it does definitely help out unique cohesion always thought or kind of
[01:33:55] came to the conclusion or whatever that uh we get close somebody has to do hard things like
[01:34:01] basically you have to go through the whole spectrum of things right hard easy good and that and
[01:34:07] you go through all that together and still emerge without breaking up or not being friends or whatever
[01:34:13] so a lot of times if you're forced in a situation with this uh what you call on the interest is
[01:34:19] the same for everybody like a line in drifter or a common interest and coming go they're kind of
[01:34:24] forced to be in the environment so they go through the hard times the fun times they go through the
[01:34:29] whole spectrum of things and a lot of times in the military and battle they go through the
[01:34:34] really really hard times and then which kind of you know on the flip side can precipitate really
[01:34:40] really good times as well for if you know when you when you're triumphant with the guy with
[01:34:44] next you in hard times that's a really really good time so if you have that consistently
[01:34:49] boom that bond and same thing with like it's funny when you when you started talking about
[01:34:53] good times outside of echoes being stupid but then I thought about it it's like oh no that's
[01:34:58] important like just hard times cool you're gonna forge one part of unity but also like having fun
[01:35:06] and having good times is also a way that forms a certain part of the unity yeah I think that a
[01:35:11] a group that only has good times you don't get tested yes you gotta go through some hardship too
[01:35:16] yeah hundred percent and that's what it always felt like where you gotta go through the whole
[01:35:19] spectrum of ups and downs kind of together over over a period of time even if you don't go
[01:35:24] through it over a period of time if you get the whole spectrum you'll have a closeness that's
[01:35:28] kind of hard to replicate you know but if you do it consistently like for a long time yeah you
[01:35:34] be that's why brother and sister a lot of time or like to brothers who grew up together like
[01:35:39] really close to whatever that's why it's like oh there's a different kind of relationship because
[01:35:44] it kind of like me and my brother were twins so we literally went through everything together
[01:35:49] literally so like the first time of that or whatever experience the first time was the first time
[01:35:55] for both of us you know so like the opposite time we wound up being really really close but that was
[01:36:00] kind of like that's where I had always feel like you know you I can go through an experience by myself
[01:36:06] and then a thought that's gonna be really close in my mind like it'll it won't be a lot of
[01:36:13] time we'll go by before I think oh I wonder what he would think about this or I know what he would
[01:36:18] think about this you know or you know it like this boom you know like and you get those kind of
[01:36:22] thoughts with the people that you super close with yeah the the heart of the combat the
[01:36:27] title of the bond because also to your point the heart of the combat the better the times are
[01:36:33] when you're not in combat anymore yeah and you kind of bro you kind of stretch out that spectrum right
[01:36:37] so it's like more it's deeper yeah check this is an important thing that we've covered on this podcast
[01:36:44] before was a quick quote for brave men who do not know each other well will not dare attack a lion
[01:36:51] for less brave but knowing each other well sure of their reliability and consequently of mutual aid
[01:36:56] will attack resolutely there is there is the science of organizations of army of armies in a nutshell
[01:37:05] and that's from battle studies by ardent the peak who we covered on this podcast battle studies
[01:37:12] but that's such an important thing remember he's like that's that's that's the science of building
[01:37:18] an army working together that's why at national and front we talk about building relationships
[01:37:23] because if we have a relationship with five relationship with three other people we'll take
[01:37:27] down a lion if I don't know these dudes we're not taking one on I'm not stepping forth it's not happening
[01:37:34] you ever watch the movie speed speed speed speed speed and he's sending
[01:37:40] I was on a boss or something that I never watched it okay so really dumb so there's a part of
[01:37:44] at the end where they like kind of I don't know falling love for lack of a better way to put it
[01:37:49] and they even say can you edit that out for this podcast I want to talk about that
[01:37:53] what love
[01:37:58] anywhere they he they say uh I think they even mentioned earlier were you shouldn't get into
[01:38:06] relationship based on extreme experiences oh because it's like whatever the reason and whatever
[01:38:12] but that goes with kind of what you think because when you go through these crazy experiences it
[01:38:16] brings you closer together that's like the like like chas in the wedding singer when he starts
[01:38:21] going a few rules to pick up girls oh yeah that's that or no the wedding crashers what
[01:38:26] are what a crashers yeah he says uh grief is the nature's most powerful afrogate yeah
[01:38:33] he goes he's extreme situations the tradition marine values and attitudes are stressed from
[01:38:44] the day the first day the marine core and are constantly reinforced we are told over and over again
[01:38:51] the marine never quit some marine never surrenders and marine never retreats marine's never leave
[01:38:54] the dead wounded these are values become ingrained into the very being of every marine
[01:38:58] the last parallel core but martin rus u.s.m. see the average marine if such a condition exists
[01:39:09] is definitely not the lad represented on the recruiting poster more likely he is a small pimple
[01:39:15] faced young man who because it has been so skillfully pounded into him in boot camp believes he can
[01:39:22] lick the world commitment there's a quote in here about commitment men take a kind of hard
[01:39:32] pride in belonging to a famous outfit even when doing so exposes them to exceptional danger
[01:39:38] this is an essential element in the psychology of shock troops
[01:39:44] talks about aggression compassion for the enemy and non-compatence is a characteristic that
[01:39:49] is not uncommon among the marines in the battlefield however you must recognize that an aggressive
[01:39:55] fighting style is our trademark seek to maintain this determination and initiative as long as necessary
[01:40:00] to accomplish the mission and overcome the enemy understand that you will bolster the confidence
[01:40:05] of your marines by accomplishing the mission at the lowest possible cost in casualties
[01:40:12] patriotism every marine must be convinced of the right rightness of their countries cause
[01:40:17] rewards imponishment the purpose of our system of rewards and combat is intended to reflect
[01:40:22] the recognition of marines as warriors this recognition of heroic efforts and sacrifices on
[01:40:27] behalf of your fellow marines is an important leadership responsibility when it comes to combat
[01:40:32] there's no amount of pay or any metal that can adequately award any marine for risking their
[01:40:38] life to achieve a particular objective when marines who've experienced combat are questioned that
[01:40:44] they tend to respond that their greatest fear was being perceived as less than adequate in the eyes
[01:40:50] of their fellow marines their only reward was the respect praise and recognition which came from
[01:40:58] within their unit that is no doubt the talk many times about what reputation means in the seal teams
[01:41:09] and that's where you get that reputation how do you behave the in tough situations in combat
[01:41:15] situations even in tough training situations social factors affecting marines primary group
[01:41:25] which is their fire team squad or puttune are significant aspects of achieving combat motivation
[01:41:30] marines will often identify with friends who are from their same home state or same geographic
[01:41:35] area this helps build unique cohesion so getting the guys to work together this section
[01:41:46] discipline a spree decor and proficiency are significant factors that you as a leader can
[01:41:51] develop in your marines these along with morale and motivation will influence your success in combat
[01:41:57] man when you're skilled at something and you practice and you train it just helps in every aspect
[01:42:04] proficiency is so important and obviously discipline I said earlier that we're going to get into
[01:42:12] a little bit of this discipline is the willful obedience of orders discipline is exemplified by
[01:42:17] situation where the individual has been taught to sacrifice their interest for the common good
[01:42:22] and respond from a sense of duty which is more important than individual rights or wants now
[01:42:28] what you and I talk about a lot in here the common good this is you know discipline like
[01:42:36] self discipline is when you're going to do something that's good not for you right now not the
[01:42:41] donut not the sleeping in but what's good for the common good that takes discipline when the moment
[01:42:50] comes for a leader to send a marine in harm's way there's not room for discussion discipline
[01:42:54] ensures prompt the accomplishment of assigned missions and spawns initiative which guides your
[01:42:59] marines actions in the absence of order morale and motivation provide the foundation for discipline
[01:43:06] more than being a simple mechanism for maintaining order discipline is the essential condition
[01:43:12] within a unit that allows to overcome the extreme fear and fatigue of combat and this is why
[01:43:17] this is the part that I wanted to get into the three types of discipline first off is self discipline
[01:43:24] self discipline is the most important quality to develop in your marine self discipline means that
[01:43:33] the individual has a sense of personal duty to their unit, fellow marines and nation this type of
[01:43:39] discipline will hold your marines sturdy against anything the enemy may throw at them because they have
[01:43:45] an firm inner conviction that they will not let their fellow marines down that's what we want that's
[01:43:55] the most important quality to develop in marine is self discipline and then it goes to unit discipline
[01:43:59] unit discipline is the behavior that results from the expectations of marines in your squad it arises
[01:44:05] from a form of peer pressure where a marine knows that for an individual to belong one must
[01:44:10] uphold the standard this quality of discipline will hold the marine steady while in the company of
[01:44:16] other fellow marines and then it gets to this and this is why I wanted to cover this
[01:44:23] imposed discipline imposed discipline is probably the most important part of this book
[01:44:30] imposed discipline is behavior that is motivated primarily by your immediate supervision
[01:44:37] do it because I said so it is a direct order to perform now you've heard me say this many times
[01:44:46] we don't want imposed discipline and we definitely want to impose things on people but here's the
[01:44:50] marine corps saying you know hey do it because I said so and then they continue this discipline
[01:44:56] influences your marines to accomplish unpleasant or inconvenient tasks and then it says this under
[01:45:03] extreme combat conditions you may be required to resort to imposed discipline says the words
[01:45:12] required to resort to it this is not what we want to be doing and by the way it's under extreme
[01:45:20] combat conditions so if you're working in a finance company or you're working on a construction site
[01:45:28] or you're working on a manufacturing line and you think as a leader you better use imposed
[01:45:36] discipline you're probably wrong and then it gives the example this was the only way that captain
[01:45:42] barrel was able to force the necessary actions on the rigid career that we refer to in the unit study
[01:45:48] imposed discipline lacks the permanence of unit discipline and the special strength of self-discipline
[01:45:56] so imposed discipline is like a last resort in extreme situations your marines demonstrate
[01:46:06] discipline through initiative self-reliance self-control and obedience the marine corps style of
[01:46:13] warfare requires intelligent leaders with a pension for boldness and initiative down to the lowest
[01:46:19] level it is the marines duty to take initiative as the situation depends demands I like the fact
[01:46:25] that they start off by talking about initiative because that's what discipline you have to act or not
[01:46:31] act but it's what you personally do it's your own personal initiative talks about self-reliance
[01:46:37] talks about self-control obedience self-reliance and self-control pre-straitboard
[01:46:46] obedience is when your marine respond without question when all of your marines respond to your
[01:46:51] orders as a team a sense of unit is unit is created whereby everyone recognize that their role is to
[01:46:57] contribute to something more important than one anyone individual and unorganized mob of marines is
[01:47:03] useless in a crisis the strength to overcome the extreme crisis of combat is greatly affected by
[01:47:09] your squad's ability to respond as a team a squad is capable of dealing with the chaos of combat
[01:47:16] only in so far as the individual marines actions are part of the total squad effort
[01:47:25] we obedience right this is this is I'm surprised they didn't go a little bit more into
[01:47:33] you know these situations where you're in extreme scenarios because otherwise obedience is what is a
[01:47:42] occurring not because you have given direction but because everyone knows what we're trying to
[01:47:50] accomplish that that that's how a good unit should work a good unit should work we get into an
[01:47:57] enemy contact and everyone knows what to do not because they're obeying but because they know what to
[01:48:02] do they know why it's important when you're at a company and you've got to keep quality up on
[01:48:08] your manufacturing line people are not going to do it because you told them to do it and they
[01:48:16] are obedient that's why it's happening no they've got to understand that the quality of the product
[01:48:21] is what supports the reputation of the companies which is why people are buying the product which is
[01:48:27] why we get to make the product which is why the product is selling which is why I have a job
[01:48:32] when they understand all those things you don't need to tell them what to do they're doing it they
[01:48:35] get it so that's the kind of obedience that we want not obedience that's coming from an external
[01:48:40] but obedience because we understand what the mission is I think that's an important
[01:48:47] facet there that didn't really come out in their explanation
[01:48:56] got a little section on the spree to core the unit spirit and character the group
[01:49:02] not the individual this is us working together some indicators expressions from marines
[01:49:12] that show enthusiasm and pride for the unit good unit reputation among other units strong competitive
[01:49:17] spirit willingness to participate by the members in unit activities pride in the history
[01:49:22] and traditions of the unit those are all good things here's some ways to improve this a spree to core
[01:49:26] be the symbol of fighting spirit you want to develop start new people off-right by ensuring them
[01:49:34] they're welcome into and reception by the unit train your marines as a team develop the feeling
[01:49:41] at the company as a team must succeed instruct them in history and traditions
[01:49:50] this is something I explain a lot to companies you gotta explain what's happening where you've been
[01:49:56] what you've achieved use appropriate proper ceremony slogans and symbols use competition wisely
[01:50:06] to develop a team try to win in every competition use decorations and awards properly
[01:50:15] it says this make your marines feel they are invincible that no power can defeat them and that
[01:50:20] the success of core and country depends on them and the victory of their unit now we got to be
[01:50:26] careful because we got to watch out for arrogance right invincible's a strong word
[01:50:34] invincible is definitely a strong word proficiency this I mentioned this is so powerful because
[01:50:42] I think it helps your confidence so much proficiency is advanced in knowledge and skill
[01:50:50] the example they give here is once again from the book battle leadership by Captain Vaughn Shell
[01:50:56] in peace we should do everything possible to prepare the minds of our soldiers to for the strain of
[01:51:01] battle we must repeatedly warn them that war brings with its surprise and tremendously deep
[01:51:06] impressions we must prepare them for the fact that each minute of battle brings with it a new
[01:51:10] assault on nerves as soldiers of the future we should strive to realize that we will be faced in
[01:51:16] war with many new and difficult impressions dangers that are thus foreseen and already half over
[01:51:24] come let's say that again dangers that are foreseen already half over come if you know what's
[01:51:31] coming man you're already halfway there already half way there in preparing for combat of course
[01:51:42] they go through a section what do you need to know friendly capabilities enemy capabilities
[01:51:46] the face of combat and mental and physical fitness this is the straight sun soon right
[01:51:56] know your enemy know yourself friendly capabilities this is not limited to knowing yourself
[01:52:02] and your job this includes knowing your Marines equipment and weapons know the techniques of combat
[01:52:07] and the tactics that are used by a unit of your size you got to know the same thing about the
[01:52:11] enemy enemies capabilities their weapons their troops their equipment the face of combat
[01:52:20] says the goal of this course is to help you understand the battlefield environment although
[01:52:24] that is not possible to realistically recreate the battlefield in training you and your
[01:52:28] squadja learn as much as possible about the actual conditions of combat during training you know this is
[01:52:36] something I wrote about this and can't remember if I wrote about it in leaders of strategy and tactics
[01:52:41] or in the forward to about face but about how I knew when there was no war I knew there was like a gap
[01:52:47] that I was missing I knew there was something I didn't understand you know the big the big
[01:52:53] mesh there was some element and I just tried to read to try and understand it so I could figure out
[01:53:01] what I was looking at what I was what I was in for building and maintaining morale and motivation
[01:53:10] and combat belief in the mission is the source of morale and motivation that's why in extreme
[01:53:19] ownership we wrote a chapter called belief you got to believe in what you're doing you got to
[01:53:26] believe in what you're doing developing this belief not only involves developing your squad's
[01:53:31] confidence that the job must and will be accomplished it also involves a deeper understanding that
[01:53:35] their individual sacrifices and efforts are necessary and irrelevant what do you got to do
[01:53:44] instill confidence leadership from the front is particularly effective your marines will always respond
[01:53:52] when they see that you are willing to take the same risks as them make sure you're assigning people
[01:53:57] to little right jobs make sure they get rest food quarters remember four hours and you know we
[01:54:05] got to keep that going and it says here aside from providing food rest and quarters you must also
[01:54:11] be concerned with attention to duty you must check to see that positions and weapons are properly
[01:54:17] located equipment and weapons are maintained and that you attend to the numerous other details
[01:54:21] that make effective combat unit this requires that you have discipline and develop a habit of training
[01:54:28] and critiquing so that lessons learned do not have to be relearned maintaining morale and motivation
[01:54:40] know your marines who's married who has kids how many siblings they have what special circumstances
[01:54:52] are they under provide a break in routine this is kind of sort of attached to what I was saying earlier
[01:54:59] but I'll think this example when possible provide an opportunity for relaxation and recreation
[01:55:03] at content in 1967 during a prolonged period under artillery enemy fire one unit held a tobacco
[01:55:12] spitting contest judging accuracy and range everyone participated in some humor situations resulted
[01:55:20] so that's a good one isn't tobacco have you ever seen tobacco there's like actual tobacco
[01:55:26] competitions have you ever seen a five not what do you do spit yeah that that route what they just said
[01:55:32] uh accuracy and range like they'd I remember that I remember this accuracy that there's like
[01:55:38] little techniques to do it though so one like there's a what he called split finger technique or like
[01:55:43] you do see something it was weird he was awesome yeah it was kind of gross but I remember that being a thing
[01:55:51] check there's a section here in it's this is again how to maintain morale motivation this is probably
[01:55:59] one of the most important things include subordinates in the decision making process whenever possible
[01:56:07] again life and I wrote about this you never have all the answers and some of your Marines may have
[01:56:12] good ideas listening to your Marines is not required to use their ideas but it will improve
[01:56:17] their morale to know that you are willing to listen to them and by the way they're going to listen to you more
[01:56:23] they're going to listen to you more maintaining discipline crucial elements health check the
[01:56:36] physical condition of your Marines foot inspections changes in clothing hygiene enforcement
[01:56:41] overall personal clemeness must be continuous proper care for caught splisters minor wounds
[01:56:45] rashes and other conditions directly reflect a units level of discipline a units health discipline
[01:56:51] or lack of will affect its ability to fight man check on your people
[01:56:58] make sure the weapons and gear is maintained appropriately make sure that people are staying in the
[01:57:07] game make sure they're keeping their helmets on and they're they're weapon close at hand all that stuff
[01:57:15] that's all important for discipline just like treating people with respect
[01:57:20] maintaining that military courtesy rehashes on that combat may not require spit and pause but it does
[01:57:26] not remove you from the obligation that you have toward your seniors disciplines what separates
[01:57:33] your squad from a mob of armed civilians like that got to like that and building a spree to core
[01:57:44] Marines are competitors whatever the event or sport they like to be challenged and they like to win
[01:57:54] if you engage your Marines in competition against another unit your Marines will band together
[01:57:58] to overcome the challenge which will build a spree to core that's so good to have competitions
[01:58:03] whatever you're doing you got to sales team let's get some sales teams competing you got competition
[01:58:08] on your manufacturing line let's you can have the most square-to-way workspace in the office let's
[01:58:14] you can have the most square-to-way job site at the construction company and let's judge it
[01:58:21] high standards come from teaching your Marines and then consistently correcting them it's a bit
[01:58:26] strong when I read that like dude you don't want to be constantly correcting everyone I guess it's
[01:58:32] as consistently consistently even that I'm gonna back off a little bit I'm gonna focus on what matters
[01:58:38] but I'm gonna pay attention if there's some slack happening not gonna let it get out of control
[01:58:43] but don't don't spend a ton of leadership capital on that don't don't let that happen
[01:58:54] foster team thinking as a leader your squad consists of three fire teams each with its own personality and
[01:58:59] capability during putting their squad training have your fire teams compete against one another
[01:59:06] let the losing fire teams do the winners clean up like those the kind of things good to go
[01:59:15] talks about when you train train for the conditions of combat
[01:59:22] this is something that's important is the way you do the way you train impacts everything that you do
[01:59:32] and and you'll mimic what you do in training with everything that you do so for instance we we
[01:59:40] had rules when I was running trade at like as soon as we rolled out of the gate one of these
[01:59:46] platoons rolled out of the gate it was a tactical mission and so there was no like oh hold on second
[01:59:51] we you know we got a flat tire no it's like you've got a flat tire changing that thing it's
[01:59:54] tactical you get some word to pass do it tactically there's a vehicle gets stuck hey hold on we
[02:00:02] got none of no it's freaking tactical so that that's how you keep that and even like a
[02:00:08] resupply oh we need more water we just don't walk up to the freaking water buffalo and start
[02:00:14] filling our can't he's no you figure out a place to respite set up a respite when you say
[02:00:19] it's tactical like what it's not like a non-challant scenario kind of thing like kind of like
[02:00:26] it you stay disciplined with the way you stay disciplined okay stay this was all kinds of
[02:00:31] opportunities when you're doing that type of training to just to just like okay well it's kind of
[02:00:39] go admin I understand you matter fact we used to say that hey don't go admin right now yeah yeah
[02:00:45] it's almost like you're pausing the actual training but you're saying no this is still part of
[02:00:50] the training is still on and you know what the trade-out guys my guys influence that so if my
[02:00:57] guys were coconut joking it would it would immediately not immediately in a lot of cases it would
[02:01:05] transfer over to the pollton so if you got your if your trade-out guys are like shooting the shit
[02:01:10] because we're not part of the pollton that's supposed to be tactical it like spreads yeah yeah
[02:01:18] yeah so we would all act like we would be tactical yeah there's so many fun right if I
[02:01:26] little moment of memory because JP and I were out on FTX and in the FTX we do an excellent
[02:01:32] front we use this high speed laser tag system which is really cool but in trade-out a lot of
[02:01:38] time we use paintball or semi-unition which is shooting paint rounds and so one of the things that you
[02:01:44] could do is an instructor is as a like let's say a pollton's walking down the street or they're walking
[02:01:51] down a hallway and I was grading them or watching them I would go up and sort of like cover my
[02:01:57] face and kind of crouch down as if I was about to get shot with paintballs you'd see like the
[02:02:04] pollotunes we could so hype like you could see they're just instantly going to full alert mode
[02:02:09] because they think they're about to get shot and yeah we'd have like I'd have like a little like
[02:02:14] put my hand up over my face just to kind of hide from the impact of the semi-unition and you
[02:02:20] do that one like the training is not going on kind of a thing or when would you do that let's say
[02:02:25] a pollton is walking down a hallway during a training and they of course there's a
[02:02:30] font in their mind like hey we we might get shot at right but when they see me it's covering up my face
[02:02:35] and covering up like my groin with my hand because I don't want to get shot or it's a CJP like
[02:02:43] holding his face and putting his hand over his covers crotch because they didn't want to get shot
[02:02:47] when as soon as they see that out of the corner that I either like oh it's coming because you know
[02:02:51] we're gonna trade at we know what's coming yeah you're the instructors yeah okay okay okay
[02:02:57] there is actual like pranks on the internet I don't really condone the pranks but you can
[02:03:02] watch them on YouTube where people will do that kind of stuff where just in public like the
[02:03:07] people just in public like go like cover themself just like like something like that yeah and then
[02:03:15] and watch the people reassuring exactly exactly the same way so it seems like an element of nature
[02:03:19] there where it's a deaf course and then you it's not just an element of nature to trade at because
[02:03:24] you are probably about to get shot but that's important as a trainer that you maintain that
[02:03:32] high level professionalism and you can't be coconut jokin when you expect the platoons to be
[02:03:35] tactical and you're sitting around like an idiot there's an example in here from
[02:03:42] Chesty Pillar from the book Marine which we covered on the podcast bad news only increased the
[02:03:46] tempo of polish training he cornered Colonel Pedro De Ball the great gunner who commanded the
[02:03:53] 11th Marines and he said Colonel you'll be starting artillery training next week I want you to
[02:03:57] let me know when you'll fire I want to get my troops under it as often as I can every day
[02:04:02] afterward the men of one seven were in the field and the 11th Marines were firing shell
[02:04:06] streamed overhead until the wish of flying metal became as familiar as rifle fire there were many
[02:04:13] bursts nearby but no accidents pull it was the only battalion with such training he's just taking his
[02:04:17] guys out get them conditioned to well to freaking bombs going over your head so good stuff and
[02:04:27] the last little section here that just talks about fitness physical and mental fitness combat is
[02:04:34] physically grueling the demands made on your squad are going to be extreme and vary with the
[02:04:39] environment in which you are operating routine physical training in camp ligerian or camp
[02:04:43] ligerian is not going to prepare your Marines for the impressive heat and humidity of Ocanau
[02:04:48] are the extreme cold for Norwegian winter demanding but creative combat oriented physical training
[02:04:54] will serve as a better way of getting your squad into shape and then it says mental fitness
[02:05:02] map exercises tactical exercises without troops and professional reading all help to prepare you
[02:05:07] and your Marines for decision making in combat these forms of training are not exclusive to officers
[02:05:13] and senior NGOs they're way of practicing war fighting intelligently without having to bring your
[02:05:19] entire squad in the field and you do get better at decision making you do I would got to see
[02:05:25] that all the time and trade it and I still get to see it with with leaders that we work with
[02:05:29] the Dutch long front they get better at taking a step back to get better at detaching they could
[02:05:33] better at analyzing things and they get better so that and also that mental and physical
[02:05:43] fitness that we're talking about is not just for you as an individual for your teams that's what
[02:05:50] it's for and if you're a leader you're responsible for your teams and that means whether you're working
[02:05:56] in business whether you're working in the military whether you're a first responder or whether
[02:06:01] you are a mom or a dad because you got a family and you're responsible for the physical and
[02:06:06] mental fitness of your troops so there you go and I think this manual reinforces the fact
[02:06:16] that combat is like life and it's like life is just amplified and intensified because obviously
[02:06:22] there's more intake but the lessons apply the discipline the mental and physical fitness
[02:06:29] telling the truth so we're not getting rumors leading from the front confronting your fears
[02:06:34] supporting other people having discipline not imposing discipline on your team asking your team
[02:06:44] questions letting them come up with a plan all these things are in here universal lessons
[02:06:51] for being a better combat leader and really universal lessons for being a better human being
[02:06:57] speaking in which echoed girls were trying to be better human beings across the board just
[02:07:04] we're on the path on the program this way I don't like saying on the program that as much
[02:07:11] because it indicates that like it's kind of this unique like you're on the program versus
[02:07:15] your your off the program like you know like you don't necessarily have to be on the program
[02:07:19] the whole time the path is just a way that's the way we're all in the path we're working out
[02:07:24] reading we're listening listening more than we're talking hopefully we hope so yes we hope so
[02:07:31] through that path you will need supplementation or it'll put it this way it'll benefit you a lot
[02:07:36] you'll be you'll be that much better off on this path because it's not always easy trust me I know
[02:07:43] so yes so let's start with energy drinks if you're into energy drinks got good news got
[02:07:48] healthy energy drinks called discipline go by speaking of a unique that's a unique thing that's a way yeah
[02:07:54] a healthy energy drink doesn't exist except right here there you go yeah true story there's other
[02:07:59] people that like oh oh ours is healthy but we put 350 milligrams of caffeine into it yeah
[02:08:05] it's not healthy you can't call that healthy can't put a label on it calls healthy
[02:08:09] you can't put sugar in there and say it's healthy you can't put chemicals in there and call
[02:08:12] healthy that doesn't work that's not the truth yeah so we have something legitimately healthy
[02:08:19] good to go you're certain you know discipline go boom many flavors eight of them if I'm not mistaken
[02:08:27] I think man goes the best one seems to be uh seems to be what the robots like as well that's
[02:08:32] you know many many entities like the mango it's a good one you know but hey choose for yourself
[02:08:38] but the good news is there's options one of the same far as flavors go again a healthy one there's
[02:08:42] no real energy drink out there like it and you look you know an energy drink boom get the upside
[02:08:49] yep also discipline go is also a pre workout there's a pre workout form okay for the last few
[02:08:53] days drink coffee coffee am I addicted to coffee I don't think so how many cups a day
[02:08:59] one every day two like two okay two every day maybe three but it's all at once like in the morning
[02:09:04] okay whatever yeah it's like a big coffee whatever I take almost every day but if I don't have
[02:09:09] it I'm gonna head a turn of the like that so I don't know that I'm addicted to coffee okay so let's
[02:09:14] put that pre workout so for the past three days I have no coffee but I worked out first thing in the
[02:09:20] morning I actually more than three days yeah more than three days um but I work out in the morning
[02:09:25] so I'm not gonna drink a coffee then do the pre workout you know it's like it's kind of double
[02:09:30] what it called double dipping unnecessary so you don't straight to the pre workout straight to the
[02:09:34] pre workout one scoop and a half by the way okay I don't get the weird not here's the thing the
[02:09:40] jitter of the coffee and it's not really a jitter for me anymore it's more of just a little buzz kind
[02:09:44] of a thing I don't you don't get that from the pre workout I don't even mind the jitter by the way
[02:09:50] that buzzer when I don't mind that but I didn't notice that you don't get it but I'll tell you
[02:09:54] what you do get a kick ass workout so you don't even need the coffee you seem saying yeah
[02:10:00] so anyway yes so you can use it as a pre workout again it's powder it's good taste just as
[02:10:05] good makes it with whatever you want water whatever but very good this will help you on the path
[02:10:10] when you're working out trust me you want to be that much more better off when you're on it trust
[02:10:16] me also got some protein this high quality protein is it right yes it is it is very very good
[02:10:23] if I mean did anything to you if you want to choke down low quality protein that tastes kind of
[02:10:28] junk this is not the one for you but this one is good yeah you're gonna want that gratification
[02:10:34] of just so you need something that tastes delicious you know the you've ever seen the meme
[02:10:38] of whatever it is that it's like oh yeah you can eat whatever whatever and it's like oh that
[02:10:44] face you make one now I want something sweet right there's a me and there's funny ways of
[02:10:50] presenting it but it comes all different forms whatever but it always reminds me of that you know
[02:10:56] it's essentially usually someone who's like let's say they over consume we'll say that and you know
[02:11:02] I'm super full but now I want something sweet kind of a thing like that's a thing or whatever
[02:11:07] well it seems to be a thing for me because I be drinking milk and after I have to have a straight
[02:11:12] up to homo hawk steak I think that's why it's a thing I'd say more I would say
[02:11:20] 65% of the time when I get done eating something that is like steak I still want to have a
[02:11:31] little bit of a little bit of a little more I'm getting on the milk train do you drink milk just
[02:11:38] in general like oh I'll just have a couple of milk or gossip milk it's gonna have milk and it
[02:11:42] because why would I even that's like just the one of the dumbest things I've ever heard no but you
[02:11:47] don't like okay so I'll tell you this if I was gonna if I was gonna let's say we had a little
[02:11:51] scenario happening where I was gonna have a chocolate chip cookie then milk with no milk would be in
[02:11:59] play but you know some people drink milk with dinner that's the norm I had a keto peanut butter
[02:12:06] and chocolate cake the other day pretty amazing pretty amazing very shocking the amazing but I also
[02:12:14] had a little bit of milk milk regular milk because it was that was kind of the that was where I was
[02:12:19] feeling yeah but the keto chocolate peanut butter cake credit was given true try to be what's the
[02:12:29] purpose of keto chocolate peanut butter cake because then you're not there's there's there's
[02:12:34] two things look I could tell you that hey you know you want to stay in ketosis and all this stuff
[02:12:39] I wasn't even in ketosis when I did the right but here's the thing when if you if right now
[02:12:46] if you and I sat down and ate a piece of like whatever just giant chocolate cake filled with sugar
[02:12:54] I would feel like crap would you feel like crap maybe in two hours
[02:12:58] I would feel I would feel like crap in like two hours a big I am whatever what's the word
[02:13:04] the pharject the pharject if two hours maybe even like he isn't it probably doesn't even take an hour
[02:13:09] immediately not immediately but you're like oh I just doused to my system with freaking sugar
[02:13:16] and you feel like crap when you I when I had this and I've had several keto ish desserts right
[02:13:27] and they're good and then you go if I still feel pretty freaking good you know okay
[02:13:32] so that's why I just yeah I'd rather have that and I'm telling you there they're kind of like
[02:13:38] milk you know you never milk like it's a milkshake you can have one of these and you're not like
[02:13:42] I still really want a real peanut butter freaking chocolate cake or whatever you know yeah yeah
[02:13:51] yes certain things don't pair well though with like chocolate cake or keto chocolate peanut butter
[02:13:57] cake or whatever like it's too much chocolate like let's say milk didn't exist right you you eat a
[02:14:03] chocolate chip cookie you know drink some white milk yeah you don't want chocolate milk no too much doesn't
[02:14:09] pair well exactly right you don't pair any I've had a pair of stuff everyone's like but
[02:14:14] here's the thing my pairing is kind of off when I eat chili you know like chili
[02:14:19] chili and rice maybe some cornbread if we're lucky um I like milk with chili
[02:14:24] is that that's weird right that's the jam seems like a good golf I think yeah
[02:14:29] yeah for sure when I was a kid my mom would make spaghetti and I would just sit there
[02:14:34] at the table like the rest of the family would be done it gone for an hour and I'd be saying
[02:14:39] they're just eating spaghetti and I would have a gallon of milk and just pouring glasses of milk
[02:14:45] because I don't okay so that's it yeah that's I'm framing your I don't know for 13141516
[02:14:52] your stomach is literally a bonnambus pad then you can slow to eat enough so chill okay my
[02:14:57] mom said I used to be like I sleep in the car when I was like 12 or 13 and just wake up
[02:15:04] and be like can we get food right now and my mom said if I didn't you if we didn't get over to a
[02:15:08] Mickey D's stat then I'd start getting angry well it I'm just saying fully and that is a thing
[02:15:17] that's weird that and you I never thought about that specifically but I do remember where like okay
[02:15:24] so I have this cousin Evan Evan Charles by the way um he'd be a and he'd be a and he'd be a and if
[02:15:30] I was taken okay he'd be a and I forgot how to spell it nonetheless Evan he so he came to visit
[02:15:38] and we're the same age so he was but or he would maybe year old in us I forget so I think same age
[02:15:43] and we were I remember because we're in like six or seventh grade but he was huge huge like tall dude
[02:15:48] super tall and he would drink a whole half gallon of juice you know the calf can't concentrate the whole
[02:15:54] thing he just drank it I was like bro like I can understand like that that juice is delicious and I
[02:16:01] said but man I'm not like I'm not ready for that that's a lot of juice to drink just in one go like that
[02:16:06] and that's a lot two years later I remember drinking a whole half gallon of juice because you were in the zone
[02:16:13] yeah well because I grew up you know I don't think I was even his size but I was like at that time I was like yeah
[02:16:18] maybe 14 15 years old so drinking the whole thing and I remember thinking oh yeah Evan was pounding
[02:16:24] this juice the same way but I get it now bro when you're thirsty you just want to pound that juice
[02:16:29] same same but yes I am thinking your stomach is kind of like a bottomless bit you eat the whole thing
[02:16:35] a cereal whole thing like it's nothing chocolate is just pounding milk yeah whole for shit yeah like
[02:16:41] nonetheless more milk but milk in and more whatever yeah and there's a good a lot of cool little
[02:16:46] recipes you can add to the flavors if you want it's not necessary totally necessary but if you want
[02:16:51] you can you can enhance that milk if you like also for your immunity and for things that you don't
[02:16:56] want to worry about try workout try lift weights if you're into lifting weights which should be I
[02:17:02] think you should be as doctors think you should be I from what I'm understanding more and more

[02:17:19] the stuff and of course cardiovascular has a lot of health benefits but for like immunity

[02:30:09] but for leading yourself and it says in the book the self discipline is the most important quality
[02:30:17] it is your personal duty to yourself and if you develop this discipline then like a discipline
[02:30:26] marine you will hold sturdy against anything and thrown at you based on that firm inner conviction
[02:30:34] that you will not falter you will not flounder you will not fail and to demonstrate that discipline
[02:30:45] to demonstrate that discipline you have to show self reliance you have to have self control
[02:30:51] and you have to have initiative to make things happen so take some initiative
