00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.56
This is Jocco podcast number 71.

2
00:00:05.56 --> 00:00:09.24
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:09.24 --> 00:00:11.24
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:11.24 --> 00:00:17.36
Good evening.

5
00:00:17.36 --> 00:00:19.76
A helmet for my pillow.

6
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:21.52
A poncho for my bed.

7
00:00:21.52 --> 00:00:24.72
My rifle rests across my chest.

8
00:00:24.72 --> 00:00:28.16
The stars swing overhead.

9
00:00:28.16 --> 00:00:33.16
And to your holes and gun pits, kill them with rifles and knives.

10
00:00:33.16 --> 00:00:39.28
Feed them with lead until they are dead, and widowed are their wives.

11
00:00:39.28 --> 00:00:44.000
Sons of the mothers who gave you honor and gift a birth.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.60
Strike with the knife till blood and life run out upon the earth.

13
00:00:50.60 --> 00:00:53.72
Marines, keep faith with your glory.

14
00:00:53.72 --> 00:01:00.72
Keep to your trembling hole in true to your fuel of nip on steel can't penetrate your

15
00:01:00.72 --> 00:01:02.92
soul.

16
00:01:02.92 --> 00:01:05.68
Closing they charge all howling.

17
00:01:05.68 --> 00:01:08.52
Their breasts all targets large.

18
00:01:08.52 --> 00:01:10.32
The gun must shake.

19
00:01:10.32 --> 00:01:16.16
The bullets make a slaughter of their charge.

20
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:18.68
Red are the flashing tracers.

21
00:01:18.68 --> 00:01:21.12
Yellow the bursting shells.

22
00:01:21.12 --> 00:01:24.12
Verses the cry of men who die.

23
00:01:24.12 --> 00:01:28.96
Shrill are the wounded's yells.

24
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:31.96
God how the night real stricken.

25
00:01:31.96 --> 00:01:34.48
She streaks with orange spark.

26
00:01:34.48 --> 00:01:38.20
The mortars lash and the cannons crash.

27
00:01:38.20 --> 00:01:42.08
Have crucified the dark.

28
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:44.68
St. Michael Angel of Battle.

29
00:01:44.68 --> 00:01:47.12
We praise you to God on high.

30
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:54.12
The foe you gave was strong and brave and unafraid to die.

31
00:01:54.12 --> 00:01:59.76
Speak to the Lord for our comrades, killed when the battle seemed lost.

32
00:01:59.76 --> 00:02:03.28
They went to meet a bright defeat.

33
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:06.88
The heroes holocaust.

34
00:02:06.88 --> 00:02:09.28
Falses the vault of the victor.

35
00:02:09.28 --> 00:02:11.88
Empty are living pride.

36
00:02:11.88 --> 00:02:16.52
For those who fell, there is no hell.

37
00:02:16.52 --> 00:02:23.52
For the brave who died.

38
00:02:23.52 --> 00:02:33.88
And that's a excerpt from a poem that opens a book called Helmet from My Pillow.

39
00:02:33.88 --> 00:02:41.08
Then the book was written by a guy named Robert Lecki.

40
00:02:41.08 --> 00:02:42.60
Otherwise known as Lucky.

41
00:02:42.60 --> 00:02:45.52
Everybody called him Lucky.

42
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:48.92
And he was a machine gunner.

43
00:02:48.92 --> 00:02:54.52
And then a scout with the first Marine Division in World War II.

44
00:02:54.52 --> 00:03:03.96
And he's a decent part of the HBO series, the Pacific, which is if you haven't watched

45
00:03:03.96 --> 00:03:07.20
that, just buy it right now and watch it.

46
00:03:07.20 --> 00:03:09.80
It's awesome.

47
00:03:09.80 --> 00:03:13.92
It's based on a bunch of different books and a bunch of different events from the Pacific.

48
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:16.20
And a lot of them Eugene Sledge.

49
00:03:16.20 --> 00:03:18.56
That's another one with the old breed.

50
00:03:18.56 --> 00:03:20.20
There's a lot that he plays a main role.

51
00:03:20.20 --> 00:03:26.04
John Basel, plays a large role in that series.

52
00:03:26.04 --> 00:03:27.80
There's other a bunch of other books.

53
00:03:27.80 --> 00:03:31.28
We've done a bunch of them on this podcast.

54
00:03:31.28 --> 00:03:35.44
And this one is another one.

55
00:03:35.44 --> 00:03:39.68
And I was thinking to myself, like, well, you know, should I do Helmet from my pillow?

56
00:03:39.68 --> 00:03:41.68
I'd read it a long time ago.

57
00:03:41.68 --> 00:03:47.20
And I thought to myself, you know, we've kind of covered the Pacific pretty well.

58
00:03:47.20 --> 00:03:49.000
And I'm just straight up wrong.

59
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.32
So wrong.

60
00:03:50.32 --> 00:03:52.000
Because everyone's experience is different.

61
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.40
There's things that are the same.

62
00:03:53.40 --> 00:03:59.08
And his viewpoint on things is just a different viewpoint.

63
00:03:59.08 --> 00:04:07.20
And equally important to understanding not only the war, not only what they experience in

64
00:04:07.20 --> 00:04:14.32
war, but also a whole other side of human nature that we need to learn about.

65
00:04:14.32 --> 00:04:18.12
And yeah, there's a lot to go over.

66
00:04:18.12 --> 00:04:20.24
So a little introduction here.

67
00:04:20.24 --> 00:04:25.12
And just to give you a little background on Lucky Lucky.

68
00:04:25.12 --> 00:04:27.64
He enlisted on January 5, 1942.

69
00:04:27.64 --> 00:04:31.64
He tried to join up the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but a surgically

70
00:04:31.64 --> 00:04:35.08
correctable condition disqualified him.

71
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:37.76
Now he was back and acceptable.

72
00:04:37.76 --> 00:04:39.48
Just that tells us a lot.

73
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:44.72
He was a civilian, not a professional fighting man.

74
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:49.000
But he became a warrior.

75
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.12
The author was one of those young men.

76
00:04:52.12 --> 00:05:00.92
Many not yet 20 who were gentle human beings that were transformed by training hardship and

77
00:05:00.92 --> 00:05:06.04
the war into fighting Marines.

78
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:12.08
These were the boys who became men and stood against and then beat back to the world's

79
00:05:12.08 --> 00:05:16.84
most vicious fighting machines.

80
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:23.64
They left behind them a heritage of decency.

81
00:05:23.64 --> 00:05:27.68
That hopefully will live forever.

82
00:05:27.68 --> 00:05:32.12
And then that's from the introduction.

83
00:05:32.12 --> 00:05:41.16
And so again, after World after Pearl Harbor, you've seen pictures.

84
00:05:41.16 --> 00:05:45.56
Using pictures of guys wrapped around the block, waiting to go to the recruiting office.

85
00:05:45.56 --> 00:05:47.000
He goes to recruiting office.

86
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
He can't go in at first.

87
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Eventually he gets in.

88
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.88
It takes him a month to get in and then he's off to boot camp.

89
00:05:52.88 --> 00:05:58.36
And we've seen all kinds of representations and books and movies of Marine Corps boot camp

90
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:00.96
and in boot camp, in general.

91
00:06:00.96 --> 00:06:03.20
But I just had to hit on this one a little bit.

92
00:06:03.20 --> 00:06:09.20
Because it's just another perspective that shows you, shows you his view of it and gave

93
00:06:09.20 --> 00:06:14.24
me a, not even a better understanding, a clear understanding of what people are going through

94
00:06:14.24 --> 00:06:16.92
when they're going through boot camp.

95
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:20.96
And I remember actually, I remember this about boot camp.

96
00:06:20.96 --> 00:06:26.48
I, they, they wrote, we had to write something when I was going through boot camp.

97
00:06:26.48 --> 00:06:29.28
And I don't know if I've talked about this before, but we were going through boot camp.

98
00:06:29.28 --> 00:06:32.88
They said, hey, write down, you know, the top three things you're learning.

99
00:06:32.88 --> 00:06:33.88
Right?

100
00:06:33.88 --> 00:06:34.88
You had to, we all had to.

101
00:06:34.88 --> 00:06:37.40
This is Navy boot camp.

102
00:06:37.40 --> 00:06:44.16
And I wrote down something along the lines of, I wrote something along lines of the

103
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:46.52
brainwashing seems very effective.

104
00:06:46.52 --> 00:06:47.52
Right?

105
00:06:47.52 --> 00:06:48.88
I'll, I'll do it.

106
00:06:48.88 --> 00:06:53.000
I was 18, 18, I think I just turned 19.

107
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.80
And that's, because I was a rebellious kid, right?

108
00:06:55.80 --> 00:06:57.84
And so I'm thinking they're brainwashing us.

109
00:06:57.84 --> 00:06:59.04
And I wasn't against it.

110
00:06:59.04 --> 00:07:00.04
Yeah.

111
00:07:00.04 --> 00:07:03.24
I, it was kind of one of those statements where I was saying, I was kind of being sarcastic,

112
00:07:03.24 --> 00:07:04.96
but I was also kind of being true.

113
00:07:04.96 --> 00:07:05.96
True.

114
00:07:05.96 --> 00:07:07.52
We call it cracking, but faking.

115
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:08.52
Okay.

116
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:10.92
We'll roll with that.

117
00:07:10.92 --> 00:07:13.32
So that's what I was doing.

118
00:07:13.32 --> 00:07:18.48
And, and I remember, they didn't say anything about anything anyone had written about what

119
00:07:18.48 --> 00:07:19.72
we were learning or whatever.

120
00:07:19.72 --> 00:07:21.08
They called that one out.

121
00:07:21.08 --> 00:07:25.08
The chiefs that were running my boot camp company, they were, you know what I said?

122
00:07:25.08 --> 00:07:28.08
And if you think you're getting brainwashed, you know what?

123
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:30.000
This is what's going to save you and they went on a big thing.

124
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.48
To counter my, my assessment.

125
00:07:33.48 --> 00:07:38.52
So there's a little bit of that here in what, what, what, what Lucky said.

126
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:42.80
He says the same kind of thing and he gets the same kind of, he gets to the same place.

127
00:07:42.80 --> 00:07:50.28
But here we go, going to the book, they're at boot camp Marine Corps boot camp in dock.

128
00:07:50.28 --> 00:07:51.28
And here we go.

129
00:07:51.28 --> 00:07:55.12
Sergeant Bello marched us to the quarter masters.

130
00:07:55.12 --> 00:07:56.12
It was there.

131
00:07:56.12 --> 00:08:00.24
We stripped off all vestiges of personality.

132
00:08:00.24 --> 00:08:01.56
It is the quarter masters.

133
00:08:01.56 --> 00:08:05.16
So if you, if you don't know, a quarter master in the military is someone that basically

134
00:08:05.16 --> 00:08:07.44
runs supply, they give you gear.

135
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:08.60
That's what they are.

136
00:08:08.60 --> 00:08:14.44
So it is the quarter masters who make soldiers, sailors and Marines in their presence

137
00:08:14.44 --> 00:08:20.72
one strips down with each divestment a trait is lost.

138
00:08:20.72 --> 00:08:27.80
The discard of a garment marks the quiet death of an idiosyncrasy.

139
00:08:27.80 --> 00:08:29.96
I take off my socks.

140
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:36.08
Gone is a propensity for stripes or clocks or checks or even solids.

141
00:08:36.08 --> 00:08:41.12
And it is a tendency to combine purple socks with a brown tie.

142
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:43.64
My socks, henceforth, will be tan.

143
00:08:43.64 --> 00:08:49.32
They will neither be soiled nor rolled nor gotty nor restrained nor holy.

144
00:08:49.32 --> 00:08:51.52
They will be tan.

145
00:08:51.52 --> 00:08:55.76
The only other thing they may be is clean.

146
00:08:55.76 --> 00:09:02.86
So it is with it all until one stands naked, struggling with an embarrassment that has

147
00:09:02.86 --> 00:09:08.38
entirely lost on the leconic shades who work in the quarter master sheds.

148
00:09:08.38 --> 00:09:14.62
Thus naked, thus quivering, a man is defenseless before the quarter master.

149
00:09:14.62 --> 00:09:21.54
Character clings to clothes that have gone into the discard as skin and hair stick to adhesive

150
00:09:21.54 --> 00:09:22.54
tape.

151
00:09:22.54 --> 00:09:25.10
It is torn from you.

152
00:09:25.10 --> 00:09:29.66
Then the quarter master shades swarm over you with measuring tape, a cascade of clothes falls

153
00:09:29.66 --> 00:09:34.26
upon you washing you clean of personality.

154
00:09:34.26 --> 00:09:38.42
When you have emerged from this, you are but a number.

155
00:09:38.42 --> 00:09:46.74
Three, five, one, tree, nine or one, United States Marine Corps.

156
00:09:46.74 --> 00:09:54.82
Twenty minutes before, there had stood in your place a human being surrounded by some 60 other

157
00:09:54.82 --> 00:09:56.10
human beings.

158
00:09:56.10 --> 00:10:00.34
And now there is stood one number among 60 others.

159
00:10:00.34 --> 00:10:03.98
The sum of all to be a training platoon.

160
00:10:03.98 --> 00:10:10.22
But the parts have no meaning except in the context of the whole.

161
00:10:10.22 --> 00:10:13.98
So there is little psychological reason why they do that, how they do it.

162
00:10:13.98 --> 00:10:16.18
And you can see it works.

163
00:10:16.18 --> 00:10:19.06
You know all those little things that you have, all the little things that make you you,

164
00:10:19.06 --> 00:10:20.46
we are going to take them away.

165
00:10:20.46 --> 00:10:22.86
That is what we are going to do.

166
00:10:22.86 --> 00:10:31.78
And there is so, there is this weird thing because when I went through boot camp, I wanted

167
00:10:31.78 --> 00:10:33.02
that.

168
00:10:33.02 --> 00:10:34.18
Take it away from me.

169
00:10:34.18 --> 00:10:37.46
And I have said this before on the podcast.

170
00:10:37.46 --> 00:10:38.46
It is a blank slate.

171
00:10:38.46 --> 00:10:43.50
When you go into boot camp, they shave your head, they take your clothes, they take all

172
00:10:43.50 --> 00:10:46.58
that personal stuff and you get a blank slate.

173
00:10:46.58 --> 00:10:49.62
They tell you like this, you need to do to succeed here.

174
00:10:49.62 --> 00:10:52.82
All that stuff you have done in the past, you are knucklehead, we do not care.

175
00:10:52.82 --> 00:10:54.82
These are what you got to do now.

176
00:10:54.82 --> 00:10:56.54
And it is awesome.

177
00:10:56.54 --> 00:11:02.06
And for a lot of people myself included, you are now, you are becoming part of something

178
00:11:02.06 --> 00:11:03.06
that is bigger than you.

179
00:11:03.06 --> 00:11:04.66
That is a good feeling.

180
00:11:04.66 --> 00:11:07.38
You know, it is a good feeling.

181
00:11:07.38 --> 00:11:10.10
I liked it.

182
00:11:10.10 --> 00:11:15.38
I go so far to say, I love it.

183
00:11:15.38 --> 00:11:16.38
And they do the same thing.

184
00:11:16.38 --> 00:11:17.58
By the way, they do the same thing to you.

185
00:11:17.58 --> 00:11:22.74
When you get to your seal training class, your Buds class, you get your head shaved

186
00:11:22.74 --> 00:11:23.74
again.

187
00:11:23.74 --> 00:11:26.50
You get another set of uniforms, you are all going to dress the same, you are all going

188
00:11:26.50 --> 00:11:27.50
to look the same.

189
00:11:27.50 --> 00:11:30.66
Yeah, I think that head shaving thing would really do it for a lot of people.

190
00:11:30.66 --> 00:11:31.78
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

191
00:11:31.78 --> 00:11:32.78
For sure.

192
00:11:32.78 --> 00:11:35.78
Just because that is some people's whole personality, you know, they are hair.

193
00:11:35.78 --> 00:11:36.78
It is like that.

194
00:11:36.78 --> 00:11:40.78
They like that hair.

195
00:11:40.78 --> 00:11:44.46
Now of course, fast-forwarding a little bit.

196
00:11:44.46 --> 00:11:47.62
But I found this interesting back to the book.

197
00:11:47.62 --> 00:11:53.06
In six weeks of training, they are seemed not to exist a single pattern, apart from meals.

198
00:11:53.06 --> 00:11:57.98
All seemed chaos, marching drilling in manual arms, listening to lectures on military courtesy,

199
00:11:57.98 --> 00:12:01.74
and saluting the right hand will strike the head at 45 degree angle midway from the right

200
00:12:01.74 --> 00:12:02.74
eye.

201
00:12:02.74 --> 00:12:08.22
Listening to lectures on Marine, jargon from now on, everything floor, street, ground, everything

202
00:12:08.22 --> 00:12:10.18
is the deck.

203
00:12:10.18 --> 00:12:14.30
Cleaning and polishing ones rifle until it is shown like an ornament, shaving daily,

204
00:12:14.30 --> 00:12:16.14
weather, hairy or beardless.

205
00:12:16.14 --> 00:12:18.30
It was all a jumble.

206
00:12:18.30 --> 00:12:19.30
What are we going to do?

207
00:12:19.30 --> 00:12:21.30
Salute the japs to death?

208
00:12:21.30 --> 00:12:23.86
No, we're going to blind them with spit and polish.

209
00:12:23.86 --> 00:12:26.58
Yeah, or barber the bastards.

210
00:12:26.58 --> 00:12:29.10
All the logic seemed to be on our side.

211
00:12:29.10 --> 00:12:31.42
The Marine Corps seemed a madness.

212
00:12:31.42 --> 00:12:33.54
So they're thinking, what are we getting out of this?

213
00:12:33.54 --> 00:12:34.78
You want us to polish?

214
00:12:34.78 --> 00:12:39.10
How many teachers ought to shoot the rifle?

215
00:12:39.10 --> 00:12:43.26
Continuing on, it was a madness.

216
00:12:43.26 --> 00:12:46.10
But it was disciplined.

217
00:12:46.10 --> 00:12:52.22
Part from us recruits, no one in Paris, island seemed to care for anything but discipline.

218
00:12:52.22 --> 00:12:54.38
There was absolutely no talk of war.

219
00:12:54.38 --> 00:13:00.90
We heard no fiery lectures about killing japs, such as we were to hear later on in new river,

220
00:13:00.90 --> 00:13:02.90
which is the place where they go to train.

221
00:13:02.90 --> 00:13:04.58
Everything, but discipline.

222
00:13:04.58 --> 00:13:09.62
Marine Corps discipline was steadfastly mocked and ridiculed.

223
00:13:09.62 --> 00:13:14.54
Be it holiness or high finance.

224
00:13:14.54 --> 00:13:19.50
These drill instructors were dedicated Martinets, like the sensualist who feels that if

225
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:25.10
a thing cannot be eaten, drunk or taken a bed, it does not exist.

226
00:13:25.10 --> 00:13:28.10
So were these Martinets in their outlook.

227
00:13:28.10 --> 00:13:30.14
All was discipline.

228
00:13:30.14 --> 00:13:32.62
There you go.

229
00:13:32.62 --> 00:13:37.98
I actually, I thought that word struck me, Martinets.

230
00:13:37.98 --> 00:13:40.30
So I did a little, you know, I looked it up.

231
00:13:40.30 --> 00:13:49.54
And the etymology of it is there was a French general that created a certain type of drill,

232
00:13:49.54 --> 00:13:51.66
close order drill procedures.

233
00:13:51.66 --> 00:13:54.58
And his name was General Jean Martinette.

234
00:13:54.58 --> 00:13:55.58
Jean Martinette.

235
00:13:55.58 --> 00:13:57.82
So that's where he, that's where that word comes from.

236
00:13:57.82 --> 00:14:00.54
That it means that you're strict, disciplinary.

237
00:14:00.54 --> 00:14:03.22
Wouldn't it be Martinets?

238
00:14:03.22 --> 00:14:06.58
Martinets, I guess so, for those that speak French.

239
00:14:06.58 --> 00:14:08.58
French Canadian background.

240
00:14:08.58 --> 00:14:11.42
Did not know that was story.

241
00:14:11.42 --> 00:14:15.02
Oh, that's right, because you were friends with Jodie, you knew him.

242
00:14:15.02 --> 00:14:16.02
Bonded.

243
00:14:16.02 --> 00:14:18.02
We bonded over your Canadian roots.

244
00:14:18.02 --> 00:14:20.02
100%.

245
00:14:20.02 --> 00:14:22.74
Nice.

246
00:14:22.74 --> 00:14:28.90
Another great example or great paragraph about what this feels like back to the book.

247
00:14:28.90 --> 00:14:31.30
It is a process of surrender.

248
00:14:31.30 --> 00:14:37.30
At every turn, at every hour, it seemed a habit or a preference.

249
00:14:37.30 --> 00:14:38.86
And it seemed a habit to be given up.

250
00:14:38.86 --> 00:14:41.02
And adjustment had to be made.

251
00:14:41.02 --> 00:14:47.90
Even in the mess hall, we learned that nothing mattered so little as a man's own likes

252
00:14:47.90 --> 00:14:49.90
or dislikes.

253
00:14:49.90 --> 00:14:52.10
And I think that's what it is.

254
00:14:52.10 --> 00:14:53.78
That that's what's so cool about.

255
00:14:53.78 --> 00:14:55.22
That's what I loved.

256
00:14:55.22 --> 00:14:59.06
Right, when you join the military, it's all stripped away.

257
00:14:59.06 --> 00:15:03.10
All these little comforts that you have, they stripped them away.

258
00:15:03.10 --> 00:15:05.54
And you're left with the raw self.

259
00:15:05.54 --> 00:15:08.06
That's what you're left with.

260
00:15:08.06 --> 00:15:11.22
And you start putting everything else above yourself.

261
00:15:11.22 --> 00:15:15.62
It's a very humbling process.

262
00:15:15.62 --> 00:15:16.62
Back to the book.

263
00:15:16.62 --> 00:15:22.54
Orst in all this process of surrender was the ruthless refusal to permit a man the slightest

264
00:15:22.54 --> 00:15:24.42
privacy.

265
00:15:24.42 --> 00:15:25.98
Everything was done in the open.

266
00:15:25.98 --> 00:15:31.98
Rising, waking, writing letters, receiving mails, receiving mail, making beds, washing,

267
00:15:31.98 --> 00:15:38.50
shaving, combing ones hair, emptying ones bowels, all was done in public and shaped to this

268
00:15:38.50 --> 00:15:43.02
style and structure of the sergeant.

269
00:15:43.02 --> 00:15:48.14
So that that one right there, going to the bathroom.

270
00:15:48.14 --> 00:15:52.42
And you get to like in Navy boot camp, the first time you go on the bathroom, there's just

271
00:15:52.42 --> 00:15:53.42
toilets.

272
00:15:53.42 --> 00:15:54.42
There's no doors.

273
00:15:54.42 --> 00:15:55.62
There's no walls.

274
00:15:55.62 --> 00:15:58.06
Just just 30 toilets in a row.

275
00:15:58.06 --> 00:15:59.06
A prison style.

276
00:15:59.06 --> 00:16:00.06
A prison style.

277
00:16:00.06 --> 00:16:01.06
And you're actually prisons have you only.

278
00:16:01.06 --> 00:16:02.06
And they're with your little roommate.

279
00:16:02.06 --> 00:16:03.94
Let even prison style.

280
00:16:03.94 --> 00:16:08.06
You sit down and by the way, you can't salmon a weight till no one else is in there because

281
00:16:08.06 --> 00:16:11.14
they give you, you have to go from this to this to this.

282
00:16:11.14 --> 00:16:12.50
And then okay, we're back in the barracks.

283
00:16:12.50 --> 00:16:13.74
You can go to the bathroom now.

284
00:16:13.74 --> 00:16:14.74
So there you go.

285
00:16:14.74 --> 00:16:19.46
You're going to sit down 18 inches from some other dude.

286
00:16:19.46 --> 00:16:21.86
That's going to the bathroom.

287
00:16:21.86 --> 00:16:24.62
That's emptying his bowels.

288
00:16:24.62 --> 00:16:26.38
And there's no privacy.

289
00:16:26.38 --> 00:16:34.14
And those, I mean, you may have never taken a crap in front of another human being.

290
00:16:34.14 --> 00:16:35.14
Most people haven't.

291
00:16:35.14 --> 00:16:36.42
Why would you?

292
00:16:36.42 --> 00:16:40.78
So you have this little sanctuary right?

293
00:16:40.78 --> 00:16:42.54
Where you going to get me private.

294
00:16:42.54 --> 00:16:43.54
Gone.

295
00:16:43.54 --> 00:16:44.54
It's gone.

296
00:16:44.54 --> 00:16:46.26
All exposed.

297
00:16:46.26 --> 00:16:47.26
Strip the way.

298
00:16:47.26 --> 00:16:48.26
Yeah.

299
00:16:48.26 --> 00:16:49.26
It's kind of football is.

300
00:16:49.26 --> 00:16:50.26
By the way, okay.

301
00:16:50.26 --> 00:16:53.70
But thing is football, that's kind of like it's cool to do that.

302
00:16:53.70 --> 00:16:55.74
The coaches don't make you do that.

303
00:16:55.74 --> 00:17:00.94
It's just like, if you're shy, you know, or that kind of thing, like some guy didn't have

304
00:17:00.94 --> 00:17:01.94
stalls.

305
00:17:01.94 --> 00:17:07.26
They did, but yeah, they did, but like the point is like it was kind of like the cool

306
00:17:07.26 --> 00:17:08.26
culture.

307
00:17:08.26 --> 00:17:10.26
So guys wouldn't close the stall.

308
00:17:10.26 --> 00:17:11.26
Oh, okay.

309
00:17:11.26 --> 00:17:13.34
If there was a shy guy who didn't want to shower, he'd go to his like room

310
00:17:13.34 --> 00:17:14.34
and shower.

311
00:17:14.34 --> 00:17:18.26
They'd be like, you know, so it was like the more open and like whatever you were,

312
00:17:18.26 --> 00:17:20.26
the cooler it kind of was.

313
00:17:20.26 --> 00:17:21.86
But that's what it did just because if you're shy.

314
00:17:21.86 --> 00:17:22.86
So if you're shy.

315
00:17:22.86 --> 00:17:23.86
Yeah.

316
00:17:23.86 --> 00:17:26.62
It came in shy is like you'd have that feeling, you know.

317
00:17:26.62 --> 00:17:27.62
Yeah.

318
00:17:27.62 --> 00:17:28.62
But man, I did it.

319
00:17:28.62 --> 00:17:36.62
I actually remember that because I had never, I was, whatever I was, 19 years old, sitting

320
00:17:36.62 --> 00:17:40.18
down next to a dude for the first time, taking a crap.

321
00:17:40.18 --> 00:17:41.18
I never done that before.

322
00:17:41.18 --> 00:17:42.18
Why would you do that?

323
00:17:42.18 --> 00:17:43.18
Yeah.

324
00:17:43.18 --> 00:17:44.18
No, you have your own little private, or real?

325
00:17:44.18 --> 00:17:45.18
Do you have your own private space?

326
00:17:45.18 --> 00:17:46.18
This is my little time.

327
00:17:46.18 --> 00:17:47.18
As you know, it's not.

328
00:17:47.18 --> 00:17:48.18
Not your private time.

329
00:17:48.18 --> 00:17:49.18
Back to the book.

330
00:17:49.18 --> 00:17:53.42
If you were on Don't, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like,

331
00:17:53.42 --> 00:17:57.62
on Don in Paris, Island, which is where I'm reading corporate bootcamp is, or one of them,

332
00:17:57.62 --> 00:18:00.46
there's also one here in Tandy, Eagle.

333
00:18:00.46 --> 00:18:04.86
If you are on Don in Paris, Island, taking a part in those first few weeks is at the

334
00:18:04.86 --> 00:18:08.54
rifle range that they start to put you together again.

335
00:18:08.54 --> 00:18:12.66
So that's, and he goes into some pretty good.

336
00:18:12.66 --> 00:18:15.94
He talks about now that rebuilding.

337
00:18:15.94 --> 00:18:21.98
And finally, and again, it's great details, great information, very cool, read, very cool

338
00:18:21.98 --> 00:18:25.06
perspective.

339
00:18:25.06 --> 00:18:27.74
That's why you get the book and read it.

340
00:18:27.74 --> 00:18:28.74
Back to the book.

341
00:18:28.74 --> 00:18:32.86
In five weeks, they had made us over.

342
00:18:32.86 --> 00:18:38.30
Another week of training remained, but the desired change already had taken place.

343
00:18:38.30 --> 00:18:43.42
Most important in this transformation was not the hardening of my flesh, where the sharpening

344
00:18:43.42 --> 00:18:55.66
of my eyes, but the new attitude of mind, I was a Marine.

345
00:18:55.66 --> 00:18:59.14
Now that's the big transformation.

346
00:18:59.14 --> 00:19:03.06
And now like I said, they go, they go to start their advanced training.

347
00:19:03.06 --> 00:19:07.50
So in bootcamp, you don't, you're not learning, you learn some technical stuff, but you're

348
00:19:07.50 --> 00:19:09.78
basically just learning a new attitude, right?

349
00:19:09.78 --> 00:19:14.54
Learning to be a Marine, and then they go from there, they go to a place called New River,

350
00:19:14.54 --> 00:19:18.54
where they're going to do some more training, and they're going to start learning to

351
00:19:18.54 --> 00:19:21.14
be actual fighting Marines.

352
00:19:21.14 --> 00:19:24.90
So here we go back to the book and talk about New River.

353
00:19:24.90 --> 00:19:33.78
Here, the only talent was that of the foot soldier, the only tool, the handgun, here,

354
00:19:33.78 --> 00:19:42.02
cultivated the oblique and the delicate, soon-parished, like gardenias and desert.

355
00:19:42.02 --> 00:19:50.90
So we're starting to get into some hard-living, and they form up into companies and

356
00:19:50.90 --> 00:19:56.54
hands up in an age company, second battalion, first Marine regiment.

357
00:19:56.54 --> 00:20:05.10
And they get some other veterans that come to start help them prepare for combat.

358
00:20:05.10 --> 00:20:07.14
And here's what he says about that.

359
00:20:07.14 --> 00:20:13.30
The first, and this is the first Marine regiment, the first also received a vital leavening

360
00:20:13.30 --> 00:20:15.14
of veteran NCOs.

361
00:20:15.14 --> 00:20:16.14
That's not a commission officer.

362
00:20:16.14 --> 00:20:21.86
So these are like the mid-level enlisted guys that run the show.

363
00:20:21.86 --> 00:20:23.06
They would teach us.

364
00:20:23.06 --> 00:20:27.74
They would train us. They would turn us into fighting troops.

365
00:20:27.74 --> 00:20:30.66
From them, we would learn our weapons.

366
00:20:30.66 --> 00:20:35.78
From them, we would take our character and temper.

367
00:20:35.78 --> 00:20:38.86
They were the old breed.

368
00:20:38.86 --> 00:20:44.66
And we were the new, the volunteer youths who had come from the comfort of home to the

369
00:20:44.66 --> 00:20:47.66
hardship of war.

370
00:20:47.66 --> 00:20:57.10
The next three years, all of these would be my comrades, the men of the first Marine division.

371
00:20:57.10 --> 00:20:58.50
And that's true.

372
00:20:58.50 --> 00:21:05.18
They always try and take veterans and they shouldn't say always.

373
00:21:05.18 --> 00:21:08.06
Because actually in D-Day, they wanted a bunch of new guys.

374
00:21:08.06 --> 00:21:10.78
They wanted people that hadn't been in combat before.

375
00:21:10.78 --> 00:21:12.74
But in the SEAL teams, we do that.

376
00:21:12.74 --> 00:21:15.14
I got back from Ramadi with my task unit.

377
00:21:15.14 --> 00:21:19.90
We didn't, and they split them up all put them in all different task units.

378
00:21:19.90 --> 00:21:22.90
So we had all these guys with all the spirits going to these other task units.

379
00:21:22.90 --> 00:21:25.02
This is pretty normal.

380
00:21:25.02 --> 00:21:27.06
And that's where the true learning comes from.

381
00:21:27.06 --> 00:21:31.06
You're going to get that face to face, that hands on.

382
00:21:31.06 --> 00:21:34.78
And that true connection to what's going on overseas.

383
00:21:34.78 --> 00:21:40.06
And here's some of the things that they did back to the book, Dr. Gundryl and

384
00:21:40.06 --> 00:21:46.62
Norman Claycher, know your weapon, know it intimately, know it with almost the insight of

385
00:21:46.62 --> 00:21:52.46
its inventor, be able to take it apart blindfolded or in the dark to put it together,

386
00:21:52.46 --> 00:21:56.66
be able to recite mechanically a detailed description of the gun's operation, know the

387
00:21:56.66 --> 00:22:01.02
part played by every member of the squad from gunner down to the unfortunate who carried

388
00:22:01.02 --> 00:22:07.26
the water can or the machine gun boxes as well as their own rifles.

389
00:22:07.26 --> 00:22:15.42
So you're going to learn this weapon like better than better than the inventors what

390
00:22:15.42 --> 00:22:16.42
they're saying.

391
00:22:16.42 --> 00:22:17.42
That's how well you need to know it.

392
00:22:17.42 --> 00:22:18.42
And you know what?

393
00:22:18.42 --> 00:22:19.42
I believe that.

394
00:22:19.42 --> 00:22:22.42
That inventor doesn't do what these guys do with that machine gun.

395
00:22:22.42 --> 00:22:26.46
I'll tell you, if you like the guys that I, the pig gunners we call them, guys that

396
00:22:26.46 --> 00:22:31.46
carry the mark 48, which is our big heavy weapon, guys that carry that when you watch

397
00:22:31.46 --> 00:22:33.46
them, it's beautiful.

398
00:22:33.46 --> 00:22:35.50
It looks the most, it's beautiful.

399
00:22:35.50 --> 00:22:40.70
So how quick and how fast and how they combat load that thing and hit the ground and clear

400
00:22:40.70 --> 00:22:44.66
reloads, it was like magic.

401
00:22:44.66 --> 00:22:47.02
Magic.

402
00:22:47.02 --> 00:22:50.78
Love that.

403
00:22:50.78 --> 00:22:54.86
Now there's not just learning about weapons, right?

404
00:22:54.86 --> 00:22:56.38
There's other things you gotta do.

405
00:22:56.38 --> 00:22:58.70
You gotta get, you still gotta continue to live a hard life.

406
00:22:58.70 --> 00:23:03.22
You still gotta get mentally and physically conditioned for combat and what better way to

407
00:23:03.22 --> 00:23:11.38
do that than some road marches, some road marches, which we've talked about many times here.

408
00:23:11.38 --> 00:23:16.42
Back to the book, a whole battalion was on the march and my poor squad was tucked away somewhere

409
00:23:16.42 --> 00:23:19.30
at the center or center rear.

410
00:23:19.30 --> 00:23:21.50
Clouds have red dust settled upon us.

411
00:23:21.50 --> 00:23:26.34
My helmet banged irritably against the machine gun that was boring into my shoulder or

412
00:23:26.34 --> 00:23:32.78
else it was bumped forward, madingly, over my eyes by the movement of my pack.

413
00:23:32.78 --> 00:23:36.74
My eyes were so out, I dared not drink anymore from my canteen.

414
00:23:36.74 --> 00:23:40.30
I had no idea how far we had to go.

415
00:23:40.30 --> 00:23:45.46
My dung agrees were saturated with sweat, their light green darkened by perspiration.

416
00:23:45.46 --> 00:23:50.90
There had been joking and even some singing the first mile out.

417
00:23:50.90 --> 00:23:57.66
Now only the bird sang, but for us there was just the foot of feet, the clank of canteens,

418
00:23:57.66 --> 00:24:03.22
the creak of leather rifle slings, the occasional horse cracking of voice raised and breath

419
00:24:03.22 --> 00:24:05.90
wasted in a curse.

420
00:24:05.90 --> 00:24:12.46
Every hour we got a ten minute break, then came the command, often on.

421
00:24:12.46 --> 00:24:19.22
It means off your behind and on your feet, cursing, hating both command and commandant,

422
00:24:19.22 --> 00:24:27.62
straining, we rose to our feet and began again the dull plotting rhythm of the march.

423
00:24:27.62 --> 00:24:33.86
That's the old road march.

424
00:24:33.86 --> 00:24:40.14
And so they're doing this type of hard training and they're doing maneuvers, they're

425
00:24:40.14 --> 00:24:45.50
preparing, they're doing mock beach landings, they're doing all those things and they're

426
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:47.58
also getting some occasional liberty.

427
00:24:47.58 --> 00:24:50.58
Do you guys know what you want to liberty is, is a civilian?

428
00:24:50.58 --> 00:24:55.02
See, it's in word that I throw out there sometimes, it means time off.

429
00:24:55.02 --> 00:24:58.26
It means time off.

430
00:24:58.26 --> 00:25:02.06
It's from the Navy, but the Marine Corps uses as well.

431
00:25:02.06 --> 00:25:03.26
It means time off.

432
00:25:03.26 --> 00:25:07.46
So these guys, even though they're working hard, when boot camp, you don't get any liberty.

433
00:25:07.46 --> 00:25:11.34
No, you just stay in boot camp for 13 weeks, you don't get any liberty.

434
00:25:11.34 --> 00:25:15.90
Once you're a fleet marine or you're in the regular Navy, you get liberty.

435
00:25:15.90 --> 00:25:18.82
So you can go and do some stuff.

436
00:25:18.82 --> 00:25:20.34
So these guys are going out and doing stuff.

437
00:25:20.34 --> 00:25:21.62
What do you think they're doing?

438
00:25:21.62 --> 00:25:23.02
18 years old.

439
00:25:23.02 --> 00:25:26.70
And ready to go to war, they're going to go out and get after it.

440
00:25:26.70 --> 00:25:31.66
In the classic 18 year old sex of the word.

441
00:25:31.66 --> 00:25:36.10
Actually, that's when I got in that context is how I got turned on to the expression

442
00:25:36.10 --> 00:25:37.10
get after it.

443
00:25:37.10 --> 00:25:39.90
Oh, from the context of going out and partying.

444
00:25:39.90 --> 00:25:40.90
Yes, exactly.

445
00:25:40.90 --> 00:25:43.78
And I don't know that partying is what we're talking about.

446
00:25:43.78 --> 00:25:46.86
That's a term that it sounds pretty lame, but that's what we're talking about.

447
00:25:46.86 --> 00:25:48.74
I think everybody understands that term.

448
00:25:48.74 --> 00:25:51.34
Drinking, chasing girls, partying.

449
00:25:51.34 --> 00:25:52.34
That's what we're talking about.

450
00:25:52.34 --> 00:25:56.66
And I guess it's a commonly used term because you hear people say, like I remember

451
00:25:56.66 --> 00:26:03.06
seen an article about some school, some college being the number three ranked party school.

452
00:26:03.06 --> 00:26:07.86
So party implies party doesn't imply birthday cake.

453
00:26:07.86 --> 00:26:12.86
A party party party implies drinking getting crazy.

454
00:26:12.86 --> 00:26:13.86
Yeah.

455
00:26:13.86 --> 00:26:15.06
But which is different.

456
00:26:15.06 --> 00:26:17.06
Getting crazy is different from getting nuts, right?

457
00:26:17.06 --> 00:26:18.66
Not getting nuts is fighting.

458
00:26:18.66 --> 00:26:19.66
Yeah.

459
00:26:19.66 --> 00:26:20.66
Getting nuts is fighting.

460
00:26:20.66 --> 00:26:23.50
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:26:23.50 --> 00:26:27.02
All right, so we're just talking about getting crazy and partying.

462
00:26:27.02 --> 00:26:28.42
And that's what these guys were doing.

463
00:26:28.42 --> 00:26:29.42
Getting after it.

464
00:26:29.42 --> 00:26:30.42
Yeah.

465
00:26:30.42 --> 00:26:31.58
So here we go back to the book.

466
00:26:31.58 --> 00:26:32.58
We were impatient.

467
00:26:32.58 --> 00:26:33.78
We were wound up.

468
00:26:33.78 --> 00:26:36.42
We could know more relaxed than we could think.

469
00:26:36.42 --> 00:26:40.30
In those days, there was not an introspective person among us.

470
00:26:40.30 --> 00:26:46.14
We seldom spoke of the war, except as it might relate to ourselves and an abstract

471
00:26:46.14 --> 00:26:47.14
way.

472
00:26:47.14 --> 00:26:52.18
The ethics of Hitler, the extermination of the Jews, the yellow peril, these were matters

473
00:26:52.18 --> 00:26:56.30
for the gentleman of the editorial pages to discuss.

474
00:26:56.30 --> 00:26:58.30
We lived for thrills.

475
00:26:58.30 --> 00:27:04.30
Not the thrills of the battlefield, but of the speeding auto, the dimly lighted cafe,

476
00:27:04.30 --> 00:27:11.86
the drink racing, the blood, the texture of a cheek, the sheen of a silk and calf.

477
00:27:11.86 --> 00:27:14.02
Nothing was permitted to last.

478
00:27:14.02 --> 00:27:15.70
All had to be fluid.

479
00:27:15.70 --> 00:27:21.14
We wanted not actuality, but possibility.

480
00:27:21.14 --> 00:27:23.02
That's pretty interesting statement.

481
00:27:23.02 --> 00:27:24.34
We all had to be fluid.

482
00:27:24.34 --> 00:27:26.70
We wanted not actually, they didn't actually want that.

483
00:27:26.70 --> 00:27:30.10
They wanted to chase that right.

484
00:27:30.10 --> 00:27:31.86
We could not be still.

485
00:27:31.86 --> 00:27:33.98
Always movement, everything changing.

486
00:27:33.98 --> 00:27:44.02
We were like shadows, fleeing, ever fleeing, condemned men, souls in hell.

487
00:27:44.02 --> 00:27:50.18
Soon the spate of 62 hour liberties was ended, mid May of 1942, saw me go home for the

488
00:27:50.18 --> 00:27:51.42
last time.

489
00:27:51.42 --> 00:28:02.54
My family would not set eyes on me again for nearly three years.

490
00:28:02.54 --> 00:28:11.94
And again, obviously there's some very important experiences in that section.

491
00:28:11.94 --> 00:28:15.26
That's why you read the book.

492
00:28:15.26 --> 00:28:16.94
It's great to hear his perspective.

493
00:28:16.94 --> 00:28:22.98
You're going to see Robert Lecky, he's a very intelligent.

494
00:28:22.98 --> 00:28:23.98
He became a writer.

495
00:28:23.98 --> 00:28:24.98
He became a writer.

496
00:28:24.98 --> 00:28:25.98
This isn't the only book.

497
00:28:25.98 --> 00:28:27.74
He wrote 40 plus books in his life.

498
00:28:27.74 --> 00:28:30.30
He worked for big newspapers.

499
00:28:30.30 --> 00:28:31.30
He's a writer.

500
00:28:31.30 --> 00:28:34.50
He's a very smart guy.

501
00:28:34.50 --> 00:28:37.18
He talks about that and we'll get to that point here.

502
00:28:37.18 --> 00:28:40.18
That's why his perspective is so interesting.

503
00:28:40.18 --> 00:28:45.26
He brings a lot of that in this book.

504
00:28:45.26 --> 00:28:48.82
But eventually, obviously they finished their training.

505
00:28:48.82 --> 00:28:50.70
No more partying.

506
00:28:50.70 --> 00:28:54.50
And now it's time to fight.

507
00:28:54.50 --> 00:28:55.94
Back to the book.

508
00:28:55.94 --> 00:29:02.74
Fires flickered on the shores of Guadalcanal Island when we came on the deck.

509
00:29:02.74 --> 00:29:06.74
They were not great flaming, leaping fires and we were disappointed.

510
00:29:06.74 --> 00:29:10.70
We'd expected to see the world a light when we emerged from the hatches.

511
00:29:10.70 --> 00:29:12.98
The bombardment had seemed fierce.

512
00:29:12.98 --> 00:29:20.82
Our modda for such we judged it to be seemed capable of blasting Guadalcanal into

513
00:29:20.82 --> 00:29:23.10
tradition.

514
00:29:23.10 --> 00:29:28.74
But in the dirty dawn of August 7th, 1942, there were only a few fires flickering like

515
00:29:28.74 --> 00:29:33.30
the city dumps to light our path to history.

516
00:29:33.30 --> 00:29:37.46
We were apprehensive, not frightened.

517
00:29:37.46 --> 00:29:46.06
So in case you haven't gathered, these guys are about to do the landing at Guadalcanal.

518
00:29:46.06 --> 00:29:52.34
And they get into the little Higgins boats, the landing craft.

519
00:29:52.34 --> 00:29:53.34
And here we go.

520
00:29:53.34 --> 00:29:54.34
The assault began.

521
00:29:54.34 --> 00:29:55.62
Now I was praying again.

522
00:29:55.62 --> 00:30:00.26
I had prayed much the night before, carefully, deliberately, in, in, in, in, in, in,

523
00:30:00.26 --> 00:30:06.26
perpetrating God and the virgin to care for my family and friends should I fall.

524
00:30:06.26 --> 00:30:10.94
In the vanity of youth, I was positive I would die.

525
00:30:10.94 --> 00:30:17.62
In the same vanity, I was turning my affairs over to the Almighty.

526
00:30:17.62 --> 00:30:22.06
And I think what he means by vanity that he was sure he would die, you'd think, oh, somebody

527
00:30:22.06 --> 00:30:25.10
that's vain, it would be like, hey, I can't be killed.

528
00:30:25.10 --> 00:30:31.46
But I think what he means by that is the vanity that there's some determined outcome that

529
00:30:31.46 --> 00:30:37.18
you can control or that there's that there's that there's some way it's going to go.

530
00:30:37.18 --> 00:30:38.18
Like he's going to die.

531
00:30:38.18 --> 00:30:39.18
No, you don't even know that.

532
00:30:39.18 --> 00:30:42.82
Right, right, it's that he knows, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

533
00:30:42.82 --> 00:30:43.82
I know what's going to happen.

534
00:30:43.82 --> 00:30:44.82
I know I'm going to die.

535
00:30:44.82 --> 00:30:45.98
That's vanity and it's on right.

536
00:30:45.98 --> 00:30:49.34
That's what he said.

537
00:30:49.34 --> 00:30:54.26
So they hit the landing back to the book, but there was no fight.

538
00:30:54.26 --> 00:31:00.66
The Japanese had run from somewhere, came the command, move out.

539
00:31:00.66 --> 00:31:04.90
We formed staggered squads and slogged off.

540
00:31:04.90 --> 00:31:08.50
We left our innocence on red beach.

541
00:31:08.50 --> 00:31:15.46
It would never be the same.

542
00:31:15.46 --> 00:31:18.26
They spend a night.

543
00:31:18.26 --> 00:31:22.54
They're they're not patrolling in and in the night.

544
00:31:22.54 --> 00:31:27.10
They're in security positions and they hear a little gunfire and we're going to the book.

545
00:31:27.10 --> 00:31:30.42
At dawn, we learned the import of the gunfire.

546
00:31:30.42 --> 00:31:32.26
Medical corpsman had been killed.

547
00:31:32.26 --> 00:31:35.18
He had been shot by his own men.

548
00:31:35.18 --> 00:31:39.90
When the century had challenged him as he returned from relieving himself, he had boggled

549
00:31:39.90 --> 00:31:43.66
over the past word, little a fusion.

550
00:31:43.66 --> 00:31:46.26
And so met death.

551
00:31:46.26 --> 00:31:51.42
It turned to be at the mercy of a liquid continent.

552
00:31:51.42 --> 00:31:58.30
Now, little heads up, little a fusion is not a good challenge and reply password for everyone.

553
00:31:58.30 --> 00:32:03.34
You don't want to come up with something that's not totally obvious, but don't make

554
00:32:03.34 --> 00:32:11.54
a guy that's scared out in the middle of the jungle, remember the word, little a fusion.

555
00:32:11.54 --> 00:32:12.94
And you know, we talk about blue one blue.

556
00:32:12.94 --> 00:32:13.94
There you go.

557
00:32:13.94 --> 00:32:15.14
Like their first casualties, blue one blue.

558
00:32:15.14 --> 00:32:17.10
Their first casualty is blue one blue.

559
00:32:17.10 --> 00:32:21.74
Their first casualties are a medic, a corpsman being killed by centuries.

560
00:32:21.74 --> 00:32:25.02
That's a nightmare.

561
00:32:25.02 --> 00:32:30.14
And I wasn't going to read this but I'm going to.

562
00:32:30.14 --> 00:32:31.86
I peered at the captain.

563
00:32:31.86 --> 00:32:36.42
Anxiety was on his face as though carved there by the night's events.

564
00:32:36.42 --> 00:32:38.22
It startled me.

565
00:32:38.22 --> 00:32:41.26
Here was no warrior, no veteran of a hundred battles.

566
00:32:41.26 --> 00:32:44.10
Here was only a civilian like myself.

567
00:32:44.10 --> 00:32:48.50
He was a man hardly more confident than the trigger happy century who had killed the

568
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:49.82
corpsman.

569
00:32:49.82 --> 00:32:55.30
He was much older than I, but the responsibility of his charge, the unknown face of war,

570
00:32:55.30 --> 00:33:00.02
had frightened him past trusting the evidence of his senses.

571
00:33:00.02 --> 00:33:02.02
So imagine you're going into combat.

572
00:33:02.02 --> 00:33:03.02
You're in charge.

573
00:33:03.02 --> 00:33:05.10
You're a civilian, but now you're in charge.

574
00:33:05.10 --> 00:33:06.66
And you're going out on your first combat patrol.

575
00:33:06.66 --> 00:33:09.58
You lay up and your first thing you do is you kill one of your own guys kills.

576
00:33:09.58 --> 00:33:12.10
One of your other guys.

577
00:33:12.10 --> 00:33:18.94
There's a nightmare and he can see it on his face.

578
00:33:18.94 --> 00:33:24.46
They spend the rest of the day out there still no heavy enemy contact back to the book.

579
00:33:24.46 --> 00:33:30.50
That day was a dull lost witness to the cycle of the sun of which I have neither memory,

580
00:33:30.50 --> 00:33:32.22
nor regret.

581
00:33:32.22 --> 00:33:34.34
The night I shall never forget.

582
00:33:34.34 --> 00:33:38.02
I awoke in the middle of it to see the sky on fire.

583
00:33:38.02 --> 00:33:39.18
So it seemed.

584
00:33:39.18 --> 00:33:43.94
It was like the red mist of my childhood dream when I imagined judgment to have come,

585
00:33:43.94 --> 00:33:47.42
while I played baseball on the castle grounds at home.

586
00:33:47.42 --> 00:33:52.30
We were bathed in red light as though fixed in the eye of Satan.

587
00:33:52.30 --> 00:33:57.66
Imagine a myriad of red traffic lights glowing in the rain and you will have a replica

588
00:33:57.66 --> 00:34:00.62
of the world in which I awoke.

589
00:34:00.62 --> 00:34:03.22
The lights were the flares of the enemy.

590
00:34:03.22 --> 00:34:08.18
They hung above the jungle roof, swaying gently on their parachutes, casting their red

591
00:34:08.18 --> 00:34:10.06
glow about.

592
00:34:10.06 --> 00:34:11.86
Motors throbbed above.

593
00:34:11.86 --> 00:34:15.26
They were those of Japanese sea planes we learned later.

594
00:34:15.26 --> 00:34:17.62
We thought they were hunting us.

595
00:34:17.62 --> 00:34:23.70
But they were actually the eyes of a mighty enemy naval armata that swept into sea

596
00:34:23.70 --> 00:34:25.70
Clark channel.

597
00:34:25.70 --> 00:34:31.22
Soon we heard the sound of cannons and the island trembled beneath us.

598
00:34:31.22 --> 00:34:36.82
There came flashes of light, white and red and great rocking explosions.

599
00:34:36.82 --> 00:34:42.42
The japs were hammering out one of their greatest naval victories.

600
00:34:42.42 --> 00:34:44.86
It was the Battle of Savo Island.

601
00:34:44.86 --> 00:34:50.18
What we learned to call more accurately the Battle of Forests sitting ducks.

602
00:34:50.18 --> 00:34:52.74
They were sinking three American cruisers.

603
00:34:52.74 --> 00:35:00.74
The Quincy, Vincent's and Astoria and one Australian cruiser, the Canberra.

604
00:35:00.74 --> 00:35:08.26
As well as damaging one other American cruiser and a US destroyer.

605
00:35:08.26 --> 00:35:13.78
And so they then during this they moved towards the beach.

606
00:35:13.78 --> 00:35:14.78
And here we go.

607
00:35:14.78 --> 00:35:17.06
It was dusk when we reached the beach.

608
00:35:17.06 --> 00:35:23.30
We saw wrecked and smoking ships, a clean, unshipped expanse of water between Guadalcanal

609
00:35:23.30 --> 00:35:25.46
and Florida Island.

610
00:35:25.46 --> 00:35:28.50
Our navy was gone.

611
00:35:28.50 --> 00:35:29.50
Gone.

612
00:35:29.50 --> 00:35:38.74
So, if you don't know anything about the Pacific campaign, you're taking down islands.

613
00:35:38.74 --> 00:35:41.02
And your lifeline is the navy.

614
00:35:41.02 --> 00:35:46.90
Because that's who's going to bring you ammunition, food, water, gun support, fire support.

615
00:35:46.90 --> 00:35:49.10
That's where you're going to take your casualties.

616
00:35:49.10 --> 00:35:52.94
So you have total reliance on the navy.

617
00:35:52.94 --> 00:35:56.42
And these guys wake up in the morning and the navy's gone.

618
00:35:56.42 --> 00:35:59.46
Other than sunken ships.

619
00:35:59.46 --> 00:36:04.46
And what can they do?

620
00:36:04.46 --> 00:36:06.46
There's no way to run to.

621
00:36:06.46 --> 00:36:08.46
You can't back, you can't, there's no way to go.

622
00:36:08.46 --> 00:36:10.46
The navy's gone.

623
00:36:10.46 --> 00:36:18.46
So they get ordered to take up position where they think an attack might come from.

624
00:36:18.46 --> 00:36:20.46
And here we go back to the book.

625
00:36:20.46 --> 00:36:26.46
We were ordered up from the beach to new positions on the west bank of the Teneru River.

626
00:36:26.46 --> 00:36:29.66
The orders commanded us to urgency.

627
00:36:29.66 --> 00:36:33.06
The enemy was expected.

628
00:36:33.06 --> 00:36:40.02
The Teneru River laid green and evil like a serpent across the pome coastal plain.

629
00:36:40.02 --> 00:36:44.78
It was called a river, but it was not a river like most of the streams of Oceana.

630
00:36:44.78 --> 00:36:47.94
It was a creek, not 30 yards wide.

631
00:36:47.94 --> 00:36:51.34
So they're placed there to set security.

632
00:36:51.34 --> 00:36:53.50
And they're there for a while.

633
00:36:53.50 --> 00:36:58.50
And finally, one night, here we go back to the book.

634
00:36:58.50 --> 00:37:03.94
A man says of the eruption of battle, all hell broke loose.

635
00:37:03.94 --> 00:37:09.02
The first time he says it, it is true, wonderfully descriptive.

636
00:37:09.02 --> 00:37:14.18
The millionth time it has said, it has been worn into meaninglessness.

637
00:37:14.18 --> 00:37:17.06
It has gone the way of all good phrasing.

638
00:37:17.06 --> 00:37:21.10
It has become cliche.

639
00:37:21.10 --> 00:37:26.22
But within five minutes of that first machine gun burst of the appearance of that first

640
00:37:26.22 --> 00:37:31.86
enemy flare that's infused the battlefield in unersely green, greenish light.

641
00:37:31.86 --> 00:37:38.50
And by its dying, accentuated the re-inveloping night, within five minutes of this, all

642
00:37:38.50 --> 00:37:41.26
hell broke loose.

643
00:37:41.26 --> 00:37:44.30
Everyone was firing, every weapon was sounding voice.

644
00:37:44.30 --> 00:37:50.70
But this was no orchestration, notably beautiful symphony of death, as decadent

645
00:37:50.70 --> 00:37:52.98
we're echelon observers right.

646
00:37:52.98 --> 00:37:55.34
Here was a cacophony.

647
00:37:55.34 --> 00:37:56.78
Here was a cacophony.

648
00:37:56.78 --> 00:37:58.34
Here was dissonance.

649
00:37:58.34 --> 00:37:59.94
Here was wildness.

650
00:37:59.94 --> 00:38:06.38
Here was the absence of rhythm, the loss of limit for fires.

651
00:38:06.38 --> 00:38:11.42
What when and where he chooses.

652
00:38:11.42 --> 00:38:18.10
Here was booming, sounding, shrinking, wailing, hissing, crashing, shaking, gibberish

653
00:38:18.10 --> 00:38:22.46
and noise.

654
00:38:22.46 --> 00:38:25.10
Here was hell.

655
00:38:25.10 --> 00:38:31.34
It is odd with what clarity the trained ear distinguishes each one and catalogs it, plucks

656
00:38:31.34 --> 00:38:37.02
it out of the general den, even though it is intermingled with coincidental with the voice

657
00:38:37.02 --> 00:38:39.38
of a dozen others.

658
00:38:39.38 --> 00:38:47.46
Even though one's own machine gun spits and coughs and dances and shakes in caloric fury.

659
00:38:47.46 --> 00:38:53.70
So it was that our ears prickled at strange new sounds.

660
00:38:53.70 --> 00:38:59.58
The lighter, shingle-snap and crack of the Japanese rifle, the gargle of their extremely

661
00:38:59.58 --> 00:39:07.62
fast machine guns, the hiccup of their light mortars.

662
00:39:07.62 --> 00:39:12.000
And by the way, the movie, the Pacific, or the series, the Pacific, shows the battle

663
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.02
scenes of the tender we river and their phenomenal.

664
00:39:15.02 --> 00:39:20.18
They do a great job of representing what he's talking about right there.

665
00:39:20.18 --> 00:39:23.50
Back to the book, we dive for our holes and gun positions.

666
00:39:23.50 --> 00:39:30.30
I jump to the gun with which chocolate and eye had left standing on the bank.

667
00:39:30.30 --> 00:39:35.34
I unclamp the gun and fired, spraying my shots as though I are handling a hose.

668
00:39:35.34 --> 00:39:36.66
But one fell.

669
00:39:36.66 --> 00:39:43.06
The first fell, as though his under part had been cut from him by a scythe and the

670
00:39:43.06 --> 00:39:46.10
others fell tumbling, screaming.

671
00:39:46.10 --> 00:39:48.94
Once again, our gun collapsed and I grabbed a rifle.

672
00:39:48.94 --> 00:39:53.22
I remembered had no sling which had been left near the gun.

673
00:39:53.22 --> 00:39:58.18
The jab, who had survived, who had survived was deep in the coconuts by the time I found

674
00:39:58.18 --> 00:40:00.66
him in the rifle sites.

675
00:40:00.66 --> 00:40:06.66
There was his back, bobbing large and he seemed to be throwing his pack away.

676
00:40:06.66 --> 00:40:10.42
Then I fired and he wasn't there anymore.

677
00:40:10.42 --> 00:40:15.74
Perhaps it was not eye who shot him, but everyone had found their senses for not everyone

678
00:40:15.74 --> 00:40:18.38
had found their senses and their weapons by then.

679
00:40:18.38 --> 00:40:20.50
But I boasted that I had.

680
00:40:20.50 --> 00:40:26.46
Perhaps too, it was a merciful bullet that pounded him between the shoulder blades for

681
00:40:26.46 --> 00:40:30.86
he was fleeing to a certain and horrible end.

682
00:40:30.86 --> 00:40:37.06
Black knights, hunger and slow dissolution in the rain for us.

683
00:40:37.06 --> 00:40:40.50
But I had not thought of mercy then.

684
00:40:40.50 --> 00:40:43.06
Modern war went forward in the jungle.

685
00:40:43.06 --> 00:40:45.46
Men of the first battalion were cleaning up.

686
00:40:45.46 --> 00:40:48.82
Sometimes they drove a Japanese toward us.

687
00:40:48.82 --> 00:40:54.94
He would cower on the riverbank, hiding on a wear that opposite him were we.

688
00:40:54.94 --> 00:41:01.06
Already the victors, numerous heavily armed, lusting for more blood.

689
00:41:01.06 --> 00:41:04.22
We killed a few more this way.

690
00:41:04.22 --> 00:41:11.22
The fever was on us.

691
00:41:11.22 --> 00:41:16.78
Yet it's interesting that he's looking back and thinking to himself that when he kills

692
00:41:16.78 --> 00:41:21.74
this Japanese soldier, that was a merciful thing to do.

693
00:41:21.74 --> 00:41:23.74
Because he didn't suffer yet.

694
00:41:23.74 --> 00:41:26.38
They've been on the island for a few days, even though they're scared, even though

695
00:41:26.38 --> 00:41:27.38
they've received fire.

696
00:41:27.38 --> 00:41:32.66
They haven't gone to the full length of suffering that they're going to go through.

697
00:41:32.66 --> 00:41:39.58
So in the battles over, and leki gives everyone in the book, he just gives them these

698
00:41:39.58 --> 00:41:46.42
really kind of easy to understand nicknames based on their personality.

699
00:41:46.42 --> 00:41:52.58
So he talks about this guy here who he calls Lieutenant Ivy League, which doesn't take

700
00:41:52.58 --> 00:41:55.38
a lot of explanation to picture what that guy is like.

701
00:41:55.38 --> 00:41:56.70
So here we go back to the book.

702
00:41:56.70 --> 00:42:00.42
Lieutenant Ivy League strode up to our pits in the morning.

703
00:42:00.42 --> 00:42:01.70
So this is the battles over.

704
00:42:01.70 --> 00:42:05.50
He sat on a coconut log and told us what had happened.

705
00:42:05.50 --> 00:42:10.02
He smoked desperately and stared into the river as he talked.

706
00:42:10.02 --> 00:42:14.82
The skin around his eyes was drawn tight with strain and with shock.

707
00:42:14.82 --> 00:42:22.02
His eyes had already taken on that aspect peculiar to Guadalcanal, that constant stare of pupils

708
00:42:22.02 --> 00:42:27.46
that seemed darker, larger, rounder, more absolute.

709
00:42:27.46 --> 00:42:33.26
And he kind of gives him a debrief on what happened with the battle that where the Japanese

710
00:42:33.26 --> 00:42:34.58
had come from.

711
00:42:34.58 --> 00:42:40.58
And then he says, when he spoke again, it was to tell us who had been killed.

712
00:42:40.58 --> 00:42:47.90
There were more than a dozen from age company besides more than a score of wounded.

713
00:42:47.90 --> 00:42:51.46
Four or five of the dead were from our platoon.

714
00:42:51.46 --> 00:42:54.10
Two of them had been hacked to death.

715
00:42:54.10 --> 00:43:00.10
A Japanese scouting party had found them asleep in their hole on the riverbank and sliced

716
00:43:00.10 --> 00:43:04.50
them into pieces.

717
00:43:04.50 --> 00:43:09.54
Our regimen had killed something like 900 of them.

718
00:43:09.54 --> 00:43:16.26
Most of them lay in clusters or in heaps before the gun pits commanding the sand spit.

719
00:43:16.26 --> 00:43:22.06
As though they had not died singly, but in groups.

720
00:43:22.06 --> 00:43:27.30
One of them reeds went methodically among the dead armed with a pair of pliers.

721
00:43:27.30 --> 00:43:31.90
He had observed that the Japanese have a penchant for gold fillings in their teeth, often

722
00:43:31.90 --> 00:43:34.58
for solid gold teeth.

723
00:43:34.58 --> 00:43:37.78
He was looting their very mouths.

724
00:43:37.78 --> 00:43:42.94
He would kick their jaws a gap, peer into the mouth with all the solicitude of a park

725
00:43:42.94 --> 00:43:49.26
avenue dentist, careful, always careful not to contaminate himself by touch.

726
00:43:49.26 --> 00:43:52.90
And he ain't got all the glittered.

727
00:43:52.90 --> 00:44:00.38
He kept the gold teeth in an empty bull Durham tobacco sack, which he wore around his neck.

728
00:44:00.38 --> 00:44:01.38
Souvenirs.

729
00:44:01.38 --> 00:44:02.38
We called him.

730
00:44:02.38 --> 00:44:09.10
So that's another nickname he gave, they called this guy Souvenirs.

731
00:44:09.10 --> 00:44:13.50
Now they're suholing in that position.

732
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:17.90
And for a few nights while they were holding this position on the river, they would see

733
00:44:17.90 --> 00:44:19.70
they didn't know what it was.

734
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:23.18
They would see sort of a V in the calm water.

735
00:44:23.18 --> 00:44:25.94
They would see like a V, a disturbance in the water.

736
00:44:25.94 --> 00:44:27.26
And they couldn't figure out what it was.

737
00:44:27.26 --> 00:44:28.42
They were scared out of the couple times.

738
00:44:28.42 --> 00:44:29.42
They shot towards it.

739
00:44:29.42 --> 00:44:30.42
They didn't know what it was.

740
00:44:30.42 --> 00:44:35.98
They thought it was a spire or a scout trying to check them out.

741
00:44:35.98 --> 00:44:39.62
But they were crocodiles.

742
00:44:39.62 --> 00:44:40.62
Back to the book.

743
00:44:40.62 --> 00:44:45.40
I took the glasses from him and focused on the opposite shore where I saw crocodile eating the

744
00:44:45.40 --> 00:44:48.52
fat Japanese.

745
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:53.96
I watched into based fascination, but when the crocodile began to tug at the intestines,

746
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:58.48
I recalled my own presence in that very river hardly an hour ago.

747
00:44:58.48 --> 00:45:03.80
And my knees went weak and I relinquished the glasses.

748
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:05.84
That night the V reappared in the river.

749
00:45:05.84 --> 00:45:09.64
So they could see the little ripple in the river.

750
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:11.88
Everyone whooped and hollered.

751
00:45:11.88 --> 00:45:12.88
No one fired.

752
00:45:12.88 --> 00:45:14.80
We knew what it was.

753
00:45:14.80 --> 00:45:15.80
The crocodile.

754
00:45:15.80 --> 00:45:19.16
Three smaller Vs trailed afterwards.

755
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:23.04
And there's even more crocodiles coming.

756
00:45:23.04 --> 00:45:26.40
They kept us awake, crunching.

757
00:45:26.40 --> 00:45:28.88
The smell kept us awake.

758
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:33.28
Even though we lay with our head swath in a blanket, which was now, which was how we kept

759
00:45:33.28 --> 00:45:38.24
off the mosquitoes, the smell overpowered us.

760
00:45:38.24 --> 00:45:45.60
The sense which somehow seems a joke is the one most susceptible to outrage.

761
00:45:45.60 --> 00:45:48.08
It will give you no rest.

762
00:45:48.08 --> 00:45:53.88
One can close one's eyes to ugliness or shield the ears from sound, but from a powerful

763
00:45:53.88 --> 00:45:58.16
smell there is no recourse but flight.

764
00:45:58.16 --> 00:46:05.28
Then since we could not flee, we could not escape this smell and we could not sleep.

765
00:46:05.28 --> 00:46:10.32
We never fired at the crocodiles, though they returned to the repost day after day until

766
00:46:10.32 --> 00:46:16.64
the remains were removed to mass burning and burial, which served as a funeral pyre for

767
00:46:16.64 --> 00:46:17.88
the enemy.

768
00:46:17.88 --> 00:46:26.04
We had annihilated.

769
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:31.44
Our victory in the fight, which we called the Battle of Hell's Point, was not so great

770
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:35.04
as we had imagined it to be.

771
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:41.72
It was to be one of the many fights for Guadalcanal, and in the end not the foremost of them.

772
00:46:41.72 --> 00:46:46.28
But being the first in our experience, we took it for total triumph.

773
00:46:46.28 --> 00:46:51.36
Like those who take the present for the best of all worlds, having no reference to the

774
00:46:51.36 --> 00:46:55.32
past, nor regard for the future.

775
00:46:55.32 --> 00:47:04.48
As a mistake, we all make something good happens and you think you're the victor.

776
00:47:04.48 --> 00:47:10.16
On the high plateau of triumph, we were about to descend into the depths of trial and

777
00:47:10.16 --> 00:47:11.16
tedium.

778
00:47:11.16 --> 00:47:15.64
The Japanese attack was to be redoubled and prolonged and varied.

779
00:47:15.64 --> 00:47:18.80
They would come from the sky, the sea, and the land.

780
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:24.84
In between every trial, there would stretch out the tedium that sucks a man dry drawing

781
00:47:24.84 --> 00:47:31.40
off the juice from body and soul as a native removes the contents of a stick of sugarcane,

782
00:47:31.40 --> 00:47:38.000
giving it spent, cracked, good for nothing but the flames.

783
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.24
And there is terror coming from the interaction of trial and tedium.

784
00:47:45.24 --> 00:47:52.76
The first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second eroding him as the flood

785
00:47:52.76 --> 00:47:53.76
at the roots.

786
00:47:53.76 --> 00:47:57.52
So he's got these two things that are working on him.

787
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:02.60
The trail, which is the actual fighting, the actual attacks and tedium, which is the boredom

788
00:48:02.60 --> 00:48:05.48
in the waiting.

789
00:48:05.48 --> 00:48:11.000
And again, if you watch the Pacific, it does a great job of showing this and one of the things

790
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.28
that really got me when I watched that for the first time is it shows this landing and

791
00:48:15.28 --> 00:48:17.48
there's nothing happening.

792
00:48:17.48 --> 00:48:19.08
Then you're waiting for it to happen.

793
00:48:19.08 --> 00:48:22.000
Then you know it's going to happen and you're waiting for it.

794
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.20
And that was a real, that, that, that, that, I remember that feeling.

795
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:31.44
Of being in the streets and you're waiting for it to happen and you're just waiting.

796
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:34.32
And it's a, you want it to happen.

797
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:35.32
Because then you can go.

798
00:48:35.32 --> 00:48:36.32
Yeah.

799
00:48:36.32 --> 00:48:37.32
Let's get it over.

800
00:48:37.32 --> 00:48:38.32
Yeah.

801
00:48:38.32 --> 00:48:41.52
But here's, he's describing it as like a tree being eroded.

802
00:48:41.52 --> 00:48:47.44
So the first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second.

803
00:48:47.44 --> 00:48:51.24
So that's, that's what, that's what the, the actual thing does to you, shakes you around.

804
00:48:51.24 --> 00:48:57.16
But the tedium, the second, that's the tedium eroding him as the flood.

805
00:48:57.16 --> 00:48:58.16
At the roots.

806
00:48:58.16 --> 00:49:04.28
Each fresh trial leaves a man more shaken than the last and each period of tedium with

807
00:49:04.28 --> 00:49:09.28
its time for speculative dread.

808
00:49:09.28 --> 00:49:16.44
Leaves his foundations worn lower, his roots less firm for the next trial.

809
00:49:16.44 --> 00:49:22.76
Sometimes there is a final shattering, a man crouching in a pit beneath the bombardment

810
00:49:22.76 --> 00:49:30.28
of a battleship might put a pistol to his head and deliver himself.

811
00:49:30.28 --> 00:49:32.84
Sometimes it is partial.

812
00:49:32.84 --> 00:49:38.68
Another man might break at the sound of a diving enemy plane and scream and shutter

813
00:49:38.68 --> 00:49:43.88
and ring his hands and rise to run.

814
00:49:43.88 --> 00:49:45.96
This is the terror I meant.

815
00:49:45.96 --> 00:49:52.28
This is the terror that strangles reason with the clawing hands of panic.

816
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:53.52
I saw it twice.

817
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:57.80
I felt it plucked at me twice, but it was rare.

818
00:49:57.80 --> 00:50:01.68
It claimed few victims.

819
00:50:01.68 --> 00:50:08.52
So that's a really, I think that's just a phenomenal way to understand what these guys were

820
00:50:08.52 --> 00:50:10.52
going through.

821
00:50:10.52 --> 00:50:16.28
The waiting and then the trial and then the waiting and then the trial.

822
00:50:16.28 --> 00:50:18.72
And that's a great description.

823
00:50:18.72 --> 00:50:24.000
The speculative dread, just thinking about, okay, what's the next attack going to be

824
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.04
like, are we going to be able to get through it?

825
00:50:28.04 --> 00:50:30.56
And you know, he's talking about guys killing themselves.

826
00:50:30.56 --> 00:50:34.60
Being so, they just can't take it anymore.

827
00:50:34.60 --> 00:50:37.64
They can't take it anymore.

828
00:50:37.64 --> 00:50:45.64
And the only way out they can figure is to kill themselves, which is just a horrible, horrible

829
00:50:45.64 --> 00:50:46.64
thing.

830
00:50:46.64 --> 00:50:48.68
Sometimes criminals will do that.

831
00:50:48.68 --> 00:50:50.68
Like if they're on a budget if they're on the run.

832
00:50:50.68 --> 00:50:51.68
True.

833
00:50:51.68 --> 00:50:56.68
And they're like, when are they going to break down my door and find me and they get that speculative

834
00:50:56.68 --> 00:50:58.68
dread and they just turn themselves in?

835
00:50:58.68 --> 00:50:59.68
Right.

836
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:03.12
Or I thought you were going to say that sometimes you know, guys want their surrounded

837
00:51:03.12 --> 00:51:04.12
by the SWAT team.

838
00:51:04.12 --> 00:51:07.92
Oh yeah, then they just know they just can't take anymore of the guilt themselves.

839
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:10.20
Yeah, I feel like that's more of them.

840
00:51:10.20 --> 00:51:11.92
I'd rather dive and go to jail almost.

841
00:51:11.92 --> 00:51:12.92
True.

842
00:51:12.92 --> 00:51:13.92
But speculative dread.

843
00:51:13.92 --> 00:51:14.92
Are you talking about?

844
00:51:14.92 --> 00:51:15.92
Yeah.

845
00:51:15.92 --> 00:51:19.12
Because it's the tournaments, you know, when you're winning around like, oh, and my

846
00:51:19.12 --> 00:51:21.16
up in my up, that's like, can be part of the chat.

847
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:22.16
I mean, waiting.

848
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:23.16
Yeah, you're waiting.

849
00:51:23.16 --> 00:51:24.92
I mean, obviously, we're late harder than this.

850
00:51:24.92 --> 00:51:26.96
But this.

851
00:51:26.96 --> 00:51:33.52
And he, so he says this and he says it, it claimed few victims, meaning it didn't actually

852
00:51:33.52 --> 00:51:35.08
most guys sucked it up.

853
00:51:35.08 --> 00:51:36.48
And you're going to hear him.

854
00:51:36.48 --> 00:51:39.08
You know, because he says he felt it twice.

855
00:51:39.08 --> 00:51:42.92
It plucked at him twice.

856
00:51:42.92 --> 00:51:45.04
But it wasn't, it was rare.

857
00:51:45.04 --> 00:51:46.80
He says it, but it was rare.

858
00:51:46.80 --> 00:51:49.20
And then he says courage was commonplace.

859
00:51:49.20 --> 00:51:51.32
So that was what was normal.

860
00:51:51.32 --> 00:51:52.32
It was normal.

861
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:54.76
It was courage.

862
00:51:54.76 --> 00:51:59.12
And this is just such a good paragraph or two here.

863
00:51:59.12 --> 00:52:01.60
Courage was a commonplace.

864
00:52:01.60 --> 00:52:08.88
It formed a club or corporation, much as do those other common things upon which men

865
00:52:08.88 --> 00:52:15.000
for diverse reasons, play so great of value, like money, like charity.

866
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.44
Courage is in the common on which the exclusive rests.

867
00:52:21.44 --> 00:52:27.000
Our muddy machine gun pits were transformed into courage clubs.

868
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.12
When bombs fell or Japanese worships pounded us from the sea.

869
00:52:32.12 --> 00:52:34.40
It was protocol to be observed too.

870
00:52:34.40 --> 00:52:41.48
And it was natural that the poor fellow who might break into momentary terror should cause

871
00:52:41.48 --> 00:52:45.56
pain, silences and embarrassed coughs.

872
00:52:45.56 --> 00:52:51.24
Everyone looked the other way, like millionaires confronted by the horrifying sight of

873
00:52:51.24 --> 00:52:56.68
a club member borrowing $5 from the waiter.

874
00:52:56.68 --> 00:53:02.80
And then he says this, but there was a bit more charity in our clubs, I think.

875
00:53:02.80 --> 00:53:08.92
We were not quite so puffed up that we could not recognize the ugly thing on our

876
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:19.08
friends face as the elder brother of the thing fluttering within our own inwards.

877
00:53:19.08 --> 00:53:24.88
You today, me tomorrow.

878
00:53:24.88 --> 00:53:28.68
And that's such a powerful thing to think about.

879
00:53:28.68 --> 00:53:33.76
When you see someone going through some trouble to be able to recognize like, hey, you

880
00:53:33.76 --> 00:53:36.60
know, echoes going through some issues right now.

881
00:53:36.60 --> 00:53:39.12
And I'm not looking down at you.

882
00:53:39.12 --> 00:53:40.32
I'm not judging you.

883
00:53:40.32 --> 00:53:45.44
I'm recognizing that what you're going through today could be what I go through tomorrow.

884
00:53:45.44 --> 00:53:50.80
And they all felt, he felt that, you know, I see echo losing it and curling into a ball

885
00:53:50.80 --> 00:53:52.68
and not wanting to fight.

886
00:53:52.68 --> 00:53:57.60
And I recognize that as the older brother of the thing that I actually feel too.

887
00:53:57.60 --> 00:54:00.20
But I've got it under control today.

888
00:54:00.20 --> 00:54:01.20
Tomorrow I'm not patrera.

889
00:54:01.20 --> 00:54:02.20
I got it under control.

890
00:54:02.20 --> 00:54:05.12
That's why I'm not looking down my nose at you.

891
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:06.84
And that's why I'm not judging you.

892
00:54:06.84 --> 00:54:14.72
And I think that forms such a tight bond that these guys had, you know, these guys had

893
00:54:14.72 --> 00:54:20.76
respect enough respect and enough mercy on each other to say, look, that goes out

894
00:54:20.76 --> 00:54:21.76
an hour and a time right now.

895
00:54:21.76 --> 00:54:22.76
It's okay.

896
00:54:22.76 --> 00:54:24.16
We're going to get him through today.

897
00:54:24.16 --> 00:54:27.52
I'm not going to look down on him.

898
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:28.80
And tomorrow it might be me.

899
00:54:28.80 --> 00:54:31.24
And he's not going to look down on me.

900
00:54:31.24 --> 00:54:32.60
Powerful stuff.

901
00:54:32.60 --> 00:54:34.24
We tend to judge.

902
00:54:34.24 --> 00:54:35.24
Yeah, especially.

903
00:54:35.24 --> 00:54:40.84
Yeah, it seems like they can relate, you know, like echoes at level eight right now.

904
00:54:40.84 --> 00:54:41.84
He's losing it.

905
00:54:41.84 --> 00:54:43.60
I'm over at level two.

906
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:46.72
And luckily I can keep the two inside, you know.

907
00:54:46.72 --> 00:54:48.32
But I don't even know when two's going to come out.

908
00:54:48.32 --> 00:54:49.32
Yes, it was at one.

909
00:54:49.32 --> 00:54:54.24
So I could very well be it, you know, but that idea that when you're dealing with other

910
00:54:54.24 --> 00:54:58.20
people, you try and have their perspective.

911
00:54:58.20 --> 00:55:01.56
You try and take their perspective and understand what they're going through and have

912
00:55:01.56 --> 00:55:03.92
empathy for what's happening to them.

913
00:55:03.92 --> 00:55:04.92
Oh, powerful.

914
00:55:04.92 --> 00:55:05.92
Yeah.

915
00:55:05.92 --> 00:55:10.92
Instead, we tend so often just to want a judge.

916
00:55:10.92 --> 00:55:12.92
Yeah.

917
00:55:12.92 --> 00:55:17.12
Judge.

918
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:18.12
Back to the book.

919
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:22.92
At night, washing machine Charlie picked up the slack.

920
00:55:22.92 --> 00:55:28.28
Washing machine Charlie, so named for the sound of his motors, was the nocturnal

921
00:55:28.28 --> 00:55:31.44
morerger who prowled our skies.

922
00:55:31.44 --> 00:55:36.08
So these are Japanese bombers.

923
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:40.60
Like the dog whose bark is worse than it's bite, the throb of Charlie's motors was more

924
00:55:40.60 --> 00:55:44.000
fearsome than thump of his bombs.

925
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Charlie did not kill many people, but like McBeth, he murdered sleep.

926
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.12
To these trials was added the worst ordeal, shelling from the sea.

927
00:55:57.12 --> 00:56:03.60
Many warships usually cruisers, sometimes battleships stand off your coast.

928
00:56:03.60 --> 00:56:09.12
It is night and you cannot see them nor could you if it were day as their miles and miles

929
00:56:09.12 --> 00:56:11.04
away.

930
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:14.80
We could see the flashes of the guns far out to sea.

931
00:56:14.80 --> 00:56:20.56
We heard the soft papoon, papoon of their salvos.

932
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:28.04
And rushing through the night, straining like an airy box car came the huge projectiles.

933
00:56:28.04 --> 00:56:32.68
The earth rocks and shakes upon the terrifying crash of the detonation.

934
00:56:32.68 --> 00:56:38.56
Though it would be hundreds of yards away, your stomach is squeezed as though a monster

935
00:56:38.56 --> 00:56:43.04
a monster hand were needing it into dough.

936
00:56:43.04 --> 00:56:47.96
You grab gas for breath like a football player who falls heavily and has the wind knocked

937
00:56:47.96 --> 00:56:49.52
out of him.

938
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:53.04
Flash, papoon.

939
00:56:53.04 --> 00:56:54.48
They are loing their sights.

940
00:56:54.48 --> 00:56:55.48
It is coming closer.

941
00:56:55.48 --> 00:56:56.84
Oh, that one is close.

942
00:56:56.84 --> 00:56:58.08
The sandbags are falling.

943
00:56:58.08 --> 00:56:59.08
I can't hear it.

944
00:56:59.08 --> 00:57:00.08
I can't hear the shell.

945
00:57:00.08 --> 00:57:01.80
It is the one you don't hear, they say.

946
00:57:01.80 --> 00:57:03.08
The one you don't hear.

947
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:04.08
Where is it?

948
00:57:04.08 --> 00:57:05.08
Where is it?

949
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:06.88
Flash, papoon.

950
00:57:06.88 --> 00:57:08.44
Thank God.

951
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:09.44
It is lifted.

952
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:13.04
It is going the other way.

953
00:57:13.04 --> 00:57:19.48
This day light now and they are only the bombings to worry about and the heat and the mosquitoes.

954
00:57:19.48 --> 00:57:28.04
And the rice lying in our bellies like stones.

955
00:57:28.04 --> 00:57:36.80
So again, the unknown and uncontrollable experience of getting hit with mortars or artillery

956
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:39.36
in this case, naval gunfire.

957
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:41.16
And again, there is no US Navy out there.

958
00:57:41.16 --> 00:57:42.68
They are just having their way.

959
00:57:42.68 --> 00:57:47.92
It is a nightmare.

960
00:57:47.92 --> 00:57:52.28
They continue to press on, but things are not looking good back to the book.

961
00:57:52.28 --> 00:57:58.000
Everyone kept saying, hopefully, that the Army was coming in next week to relieve us.

962
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.28
Everyone was in despair.

963
00:58:00.28 --> 00:58:05.60
We heard that the Army relief force had been destroyed at sea.

964
00:58:05.60 --> 00:58:08.56
Chocolate and I visited the cemetery.

965
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:14.60
It lay to the south off the coastal road that ran from east to west through the coconuts.

966
00:58:14.60 --> 00:58:18.36
We knelt to prey before the graves of the men we had known.

967
00:58:18.36 --> 00:58:23.08
Only palm fronds marked the place where they were buried, although here and there were

968
00:58:23.08 --> 00:58:31.16
rude crosses on which were nailed the men's identification tags.

969
00:58:31.16 --> 00:58:38.16
Some of the crosses bore mess, gear tins, a fixed to the wood like rude medallions and

970
00:58:38.16 --> 00:58:43.08
on those the marines had lovingly carved their epitaphs.

971
00:58:43.08 --> 00:58:47.20
He died fighting.

972
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:57.60
A real marine, a big guy with a bigger heart, our buddy.

973
00:58:57.60 --> 00:59:04.20
The harder the going, the more cheerful he was.

974
00:59:04.20 --> 00:59:10.36
There was also this verse which I had seen countless times before and since the direct

975
00:59:10.36 --> 00:59:15.96
and unpolished cry of a marine, sardonic heart.

976
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:23.24
When he gets to heaven, so same Peter he will tell one more marine reporting, sir, I've

977
00:59:23.24 --> 00:59:31.88
served my time in hell.

978
00:59:31.88 --> 00:59:45.84
Now part of that despair that they felt came from the fact that they began to feel

979
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:48.92
expendable.

980
00:59:48.92 --> 00:59:50.44
Then he goes into that here.

981
00:59:50.44 --> 00:59:53.80
All armies have expendable items.

982
00:59:53.80 --> 00:59:58.28
That is a part or unit, the destruction of which will not be fatal to the whole.

983
00:59:58.28 --> 01:00:03.52
And some more deals a man might consider his finger expendable, but not his hand, or an

984
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:07.88
extremity his arm, but not his heart.

985
01:00:07.88 --> 01:00:12.96
There are expendable items which may be lost or destroyed in the field either in war or

986
01:00:12.96 --> 01:00:17.96
in peace without their owner being required to replace them.

987
01:00:17.96 --> 01:00:22.92
A rifle is so expendable or a cartridge belt.

988
01:00:22.92 --> 01:00:32.000
So are men, men are the most expendable of all hunger, the jungle, the Japanese, not one,

989
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.44
nor all of these could be quite as corrosive as the feeling of expendability.

990
01:00:40.44 --> 01:00:46.04
This was no feeling of dedication because it was absolutely involuntary.

991
01:00:46.04 --> 01:00:52.20
I do not doubt that if Marines had asked for volunteers for an impossible campaign such as

992
01:00:52.20 --> 01:00:57.28
Grotto Canal, almost everyone now fighting would have stepped forward.

993
01:00:57.28 --> 01:01:01.88
But that is sacrifice, that is voluntary.

994
01:01:01.88 --> 01:01:14.28
Being expended robs you of that exaltation, the self-abnegation, the absolute freedom of self-sacrifice,

995
01:01:14.28 --> 01:01:21.20
being expended puts one in the role of victim rather than sacrificeer.

996
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:29.52
And there is always something begrudging in this.

997
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:39.92
So luckily they do end up getting some help, getting relieved.

998
01:01:39.92 --> 01:01:43.76
The army shows up to help them out and here we go.

999
01:01:43.76 --> 01:01:48.20
So we were glad to see the soldiers when they came, trudging up to our pits.

1000
01:01:48.20 --> 01:01:55.44
They came after another air raid, a very close one, but the thing had not infected them yet.

1001
01:01:55.44 --> 01:01:57.56
War was still a lurk.

1002
01:01:57.56 --> 01:02:04.76
Their faces were still heavy with flesh, their ribs padded, their eyes innocent.

1003
01:02:04.76 --> 01:02:10.52
They were older than we, and averaged 25 to our average 20.

1004
01:02:10.52 --> 01:02:17.44
Yet we treated them like children.

1005
01:02:17.44 --> 01:02:23.28
Now even though they get relieved, they're still working and still fighting.

1006
01:02:23.28 --> 01:02:25.88
And they're still suffering.

1007
01:02:25.88 --> 01:02:28.04
Back to the book we were growing irritable.

1008
01:02:28.04 --> 01:02:33.64
Our strength was being steadily sapped and a sort of physical depression afflicted many

1009
01:02:33.64 --> 01:02:35.44
of us.

1010
01:02:35.44 --> 01:02:38.64
The reign, the rainy season was upon us.

1011
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:42.16
On our exposed ridge, it fell upon us in torrents.

1012
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:47.32
The man was drenched in seconds, his teeth chattering at his hands darting swiftly to his precious

1013
01:02:47.32 --> 01:02:51.60
cigarettes, transferring them to the safety of his helmet liner, cursing bitterly if he had

1014
01:02:51.60 --> 01:02:56.04
waited too long before becoming conscious of their peril.

1015
01:02:56.04 --> 01:03:00.04
After cigarettes, we were concerned about our ammunition.

1016
01:03:00.04 --> 01:03:04.32
On the downward slope of the hill, the rain water ran into our pits and holes, as though

1017
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:06.60
they were sewer receivers.

1018
01:03:06.60 --> 01:03:10.88
We had to dash for the pits and lift the boxes of machine gun belts out of the water's

1019
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:16.64
way, piling them atop on another on the earth and gun platform.

1020
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:20.28
Any dry place in the pit was reserved for ammunition.

1021
01:03:20.28 --> 01:03:26.24
He who sought refuge from the rain had to sit on the water cans.

1022
01:03:26.24 --> 01:03:31.84
There were whole days of downpour where I lay drenched in shivering, glazing, blankly out

1023
01:03:31.84 --> 01:03:40.08
of my whole, watching as the sheeded gray rain whipped and the undulated over the ridge.

1024
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:45.04
That such times a man's brain seems to cease to function.

1025
01:03:45.04 --> 01:03:50.60
It seems to retreat into a depth, much as the red core puzzles retreat from the surface

1026
01:03:50.60 --> 01:03:53.88
of the body and times of excitement.

1027
01:03:53.88 --> 01:04:00.000
One ceases to be rational, one becomes only sedentant, like a barnacle, clinging onto

1028
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.40
a ship.

1029
01:04:02.40 --> 01:04:09.44
One is aware only of life, of wetness, of the cold gray rain.

1030
01:04:09.44 --> 01:04:17.08
But without this automatic retreat of reasons, a man can go only one way.

1031
01:04:17.08 --> 01:04:23.24
He can only go mad.

1032
01:04:23.24 --> 01:04:25.60
Sort of level of detachment there.

1033
01:04:25.60 --> 01:04:27.04
Just checking out.

1034
01:04:27.04 --> 01:04:28.04
Just checking out.

1035
01:04:28.04 --> 01:04:31.36
You're just there, but you're not there.

1036
01:04:31.36 --> 01:04:35.20
Good place to visit sometimes.

1037
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:37.28
You know, I don't think you want to live there.

1038
01:04:37.28 --> 01:04:41.32
You certainly don't want to live there, but it's a good place to visit.

1039
01:04:41.32 --> 01:04:42.32
Why?

1040
01:04:42.32 --> 01:04:48.04
I just think it's important to get to a point where you're just attaching from your physical

1041
01:04:48.04 --> 01:04:49.52
suffering and your physical pain.

1042
01:04:49.52 --> 01:04:51.44
And you just say, you know what?

1043
01:04:51.44 --> 01:04:52.80
I'm just turned off.

1044
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:57.36
And you just retreat, like he said, you just retreat into almost like nothingness.

1045
01:04:57.36 --> 01:04:59.08
I think it's important.

1046
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:01.36
I think to gain clarity or something.

1047
01:05:01.36 --> 01:05:03.08
Yeah, I think you gain some clarity.

1048
01:05:03.08 --> 01:05:06.96
And I think it's a very important defense mechanism to have.

1049
01:05:06.96 --> 01:05:07.96
Oh, yeah.

1050
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:12.12
You know, sometimes when you're doing stuff, you just have to do it.

1051
01:05:12.12 --> 01:05:13.76
Like you can't think about anymore.

1052
01:05:13.76 --> 01:05:16.68
You just have to turn your brain off and go.

1053
01:05:16.68 --> 01:05:19.28
And I think that's what he's talking about right there.

1054
01:05:19.28 --> 01:05:21.96
He's not participating in it.

1055
01:05:21.96 --> 01:05:24.72
He's just attaching from it and doing what he's got to do.

1056
01:05:24.72 --> 01:05:29.92
His body is doing what he's got to do.

1057
01:05:29.92 --> 01:05:39.52
Now, they're this whole time they're expecting to be relieved.

1058
01:05:39.52 --> 01:05:43.60
They're expecting to get pulled off the island.

1059
01:05:43.60 --> 01:05:48.68
And one of the sergeants comes out and makes an announcement to them.

1060
01:05:48.68 --> 01:05:50.44
Stand by to move out in the morning.

1061
01:05:50.44 --> 01:05:56.76
Yeah, we move it out into a new offensive.

1062
01:05:56.76 --> 01:05:59.88
Get all your foul weather gear ready and be sure your guns is oiled.

1063
01:05:59.88 --> 01:06:02.72
Up in the ammunition belts dry.

1064
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:07.12
Eight Marines will be up to relieve us in the morning.

1065
01:06:07.12 --> 01:06:14.16
So they think they're going to get relieved and go to a ship and relax and get, get into,

1066
01:06:14.16 --> 01:06:15.16
get some relief.

1067
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:17.20
That's what relieve is, right?

1068
01:06:17.20 --> 01:06:21.52
But they get told, no, you're going on a new offensive.

1069
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:24.48
So they're in, well, here, going back to the book.

1070
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:27.48
After nearly five months.

1071
01:06:27.48 --> 01:06:29.88
By the way, a lot of times you think of the island campaigns Japan.

1072
01:06:29.88 --> 01:06:30.88
These are little islands.

1073
01:06:30.88 --> 01:06:32.44
You know, 10 miles long.

1074
01:06:32.44 --> 01:06:37.72
You think all that probably took a week, two weeks, five months.

1075
01:06:37.72 --> 01:06:43.32
After nearly five months, this runner and he's going to name all the different guys

1076
01:06:43.32 --> 01:06:45.40
a different nickname you can hear.

1077
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:47.24
Runner had malaria.

1078
01:06:47.24 --> 01:06:50.28
Brick barely stirred from the pit except at night.

1079
01:06:50.28 --> 01:06:54.04
Who's your an oak stump or subject to long periods of depression?

1080
01:06:54.04 --> 01:06:59.80
Head and long since left us, I had dysentery, chocolate was irritable.

1081
01:06:59.80 --> 01:07:04.80
All of us were initiated and weakened beyond measure.

1082
01:07:04.80 --> 01:07:07.72
But we were to move out on the attack.

1083
01:07:07.72 --> 01:07:15.28
We could not move the chow without gasping for breath, but we were to move on the enemy.

1084
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:17.24
We disperseed.

1085
01:07:17.24 --> 01:07:21.76
In the morning, we crouched by our guns and waited for the order to dismantle them and

1086
01:07:21.76 --> 01:07:24.48
move out.

1087
01:07:24.48 --> 01:07:26.60
It did not come.

1088
01:07:26.60 --> 01:07:31.84
Norded to come the next day or the next and hope came creeping back blushing, ashamed

1089
01:07:31.84 --> 01:07:37.88
of her loyal, disloyal flight, but commending herself to us once more with the promise

1090
01:07:37.88 --> 01:07:42.72
never again to desert the ramparts.

1091
01:07:42.72 --> 01:07:46.76
Then one morning, the word came to move out.

1092
01:07:46.76 --> 01:07:49.76
Sergeant Dandy gave it to us.

1093
01:07:49.76 --> 01:07:55.48
Heaf the guns behind, he said, take only your rifles and foul weather geared.

1094
01:07:55.48 --> 01:07:56.72
He grinned.

1095
01:07:56.72 --> 01:07:58.24
We're being relieved.

1096
01:07:58.24 --> 01:08:02.24
He was December 14, 1942.

1097
01:08:02.24 --> 01:08:08.08
We had been on the lines without relief since August 7th.

1098
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:13.96
My battalion, the second battalion, first regiment, was the last of those in the first

1099
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:18.08
marine division to come out of the lines.

1100
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:21.08
The battle canal was over.

1101
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:25.08
We had won.

1102
01:08:25.08 --> 01:08:34.56
And next, they get pulled back off the island now and he's climbing aboard the ship of the

1103
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:37.76
board cargo nets.

1104
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:38.76
He's exhausted.

1105
01:08:38.76 --> 01:08:41.92
I was able to reach the top of the net but go no further.

1106
01:08:41.92 --> 01:08:47.48
I could not muster the strength to swing over the gunnel and I hung there breathing heavily.

1107
01:08:47.48 --> 01:08:50.92
The ship's hot side swaying away from me in the swells.

1108
01:08:50.92 --> 01:08:55.40
The very predition, lapping beneath me until two sailors grabbed me out of the armpits

1109
01:08:55.40 --> 01:08:57.32
and pulled me over.

1110
01:08:57.32 --> 01:09:01.64
I fell with a clatter among the others who had been so brought aboard and I lay with

1111
01:09:01.64 --> 01:09:07.24
my cheek pressed against the warm, grimy deck, my heart beating rapidly, not from this

1112
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:10.000
exercise.

1113
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.24
But from happiness.

1114
01:09:14.24 --> 01:09:20.24
He ends up having a sailor, a conversation, him and his buddy Chockler, who's like one of his

1115
01:09:20.24 --> 01:09:28.80
best friends, they are end up having a conversation with one of the sailors.

1116
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:30.92
And he says the soldier seems to be surprised.

1117
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:32.88
He says, you mean Guadalcanal.

1118
01:09:32.88 --> 01:09:35.56
He says, was it rough?

1119
01:09:35.56 --> 01:09:36.40
How was it?

1120
01:09:36.40 --> 01:09:38.28
Rough?

1121
01:09:38.28 --> 01:09:40.32
Rough we answered mechanically.

1122
01:09:40.32 --> 01:09:41.32
Then Chockler spoke up.

1123
01:09:41.32 --> 01:09:44.64
You mean Guadalcanal?

1124
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:46.04
The soldier seemed surprised.

1125
01:09:46.04 --> 01:09:51.16
The conversation with the soldier that was on the ship that hadn't been in Guadalcanal.

1126
01:09:51.16 --> 01:09:52.32
The soldier seemed surprised.

1127
01:09:52.32 --> 01:09:53.96
Of course I do.

1128
01:09:53.96 --> 01:09:55.56
Chockler hastened to explain.

1129
01:09:55.56 --> 01:09:56.56
I wasn't being wise.

1130
01:09:56.56 --> 01:10:00.92
I meant, had you ever heard of the place before you got here?

1131
01:10:00.92 --> 01:10:03.12
He's astonishment startled us.

1132
01:10:03.12 --> 01:10:05.68
An idea was dawning.

1133
01:10:05.68 --> 01:10:11.28
You mean, how, yes, Guadalcanal, the first Marines, everybody's hurt.

1134
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:14.04
You guys are famous.

1135
01:10:14.04 --> 01:10:17.28
You guys are heroes back home.

1136
01:10:17.28 --> 01:10:21.88
We did not see him leave for we had both looked away quickly.

1137
01:10:21.88 --> 01:10:25.20
Each embarrassed by the quick tears.

1138
01:10:25.20 --> 01:10:29.40
They had not forgotten.

1139
01:10:29.40 --> 01:10:35.20
And again, I kind of breeze through that park in the book.

1140
01:10:35.20 --> 01:10:38.64
But a lot of times when they were in those moments of despair, they'd be thinking, no

1141
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:40.08
one knows what's going on here.

1142
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.60
They don't know how bad it is.

1143
01:10:41.60 --> 01:10:45.88
But the reality was this war, this battle that lasted five months.

1144
01:10:45.88 --> 01:10:51.20
There was all kinds of reporting in the glory of the Marines and what they were doing.

1145
01:10:51.20 --> 01:10:56.16
And so they were, I guess, you know, they were just overwhelmed with the fact that this

1146
01:10:56.16 --> 01:10:58.72
soldier said, you guys, are you kidding me?

1147
01:10:58.72 --> 01:11:02.40
Guadalcanal, this is it.

1148
01:11:02.40 --> 01:11:12.72
Now after they leave Guadalcanal, they get some much needed R&R.

1149
01:11:12.72 --> 01:11:16.12
Rest in relaxation, they get to go to Australia, you did do this.

1150
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:21.12
And they, they go into the book.

1151
01:11:21.12 --> 01:11:27.12
Of all the regiments ours, the first was in the most advantageous position for the great

1152
01:11:27.12 --> 01:11:29.88
debauch.

1153
01:11:29.88 --> 01:11:30.88
Discipline.

1154
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:38.04
Already dissolved in the delicious squeals of the girls all but disappeared that night.

1155
01:11:38.04 --> 01:11:43.88
We received part of our six months of Rears of Spain in Australian pounds.

1156
01:11:43.88 --> 01:11:45.88
But we were issued no clothing.

1157
01:11:45.88 --> 01:11:48.28
We still wore our disheveled dungaries.

1158
01:11:48.28 --> 01:11:53.000
So you can imagine these guys are coming off of Guadalcanal, hell.

1159
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And now they're rolling into Australia.

1160
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.48
And they describe it here.

1161
01:11:56.48 --> 01:11:58.04
Girls are waiting for them.

1162
01:11:58.04 --> 01:12:00.44
These are the heroes of Guadalcanal.

1163
01:12:00.44 --> 01:12:06.68
So they roll in and they get after it in the way that we talked about earlier.

1164
01:12:06.68 --> 01:12:12.68
They start just, they're going crazy.

1165
01:12:12.68 --> 01:12:21.52
And this is one of the things I loved about this book is that Robert Lecky is so real.

1166
01:12:21.52 --> 01:12:22.52
He's so real.

1167
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:25.000
He's just a, he's just real.

1168
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.36
And guess what he likes to do?

1169
01:12:27.36 --> 01:12:28.84
He likes to get after it.

1170
01:12:28.84 --> 01:12:29.96
He goes out.

1171
01:12:29.96 --> 01:12:30.96
He drinks.

1172
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:31.96
They drink.

1173
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:32.96
They chase women.

1174
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:34.96
He goes hard.

1175
01:12:34.96 --> 01:12:40.84
And he ends up getting into some trouble.

1176
01:12:40.84 --> 01:12:44.12
And he talks about brig rats.

1177
01:12:44.12 --> 01:12:48.44
Basically, guys that have been thrown in the brig, which is, which is the military jail.

1178
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:52.16
And on a ship, they actually have a little brig, you know, a little jail room.

1179
01:12:52.16 --> 01:12:54.60
And you can get thrown in there.

1180
01:12:54.60 --> 01:12:59.08
And so we talked a little bit about that.

1181
01:12:59.08 --> 01:13:03.32
It is most especially a marine sediment sentiment.

1182
01:13:03.32 --> 01:13:10.24
And when analyzed, it turns out to be not shameless or shocking, but merely this.

1183
01:13:10.24 --> 01:13:16.36
A man who lands in the brig is apt to be a man of bold spirit and independent mind who

1184
01:13:16.36 --> 01:13:22.92
must occasionally rebel against the harsh and unrelenting discipline of the camp.

1185
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:26.36
I am not attempting to exalt what should be condemned.

1186
01:13:26.36 --> 01:13:31.36
I'm not suggesting that because of their boldness or independence, the brig rats be

1187
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:34.76
forgiven and escape punishment.

1188
01:13:34.76 --> 01:13:38.60
Brig'd they must be, and brig'd they were.

1189
01:13:38.60 --> 01:13:43.08
Nor am I speaking of the habitual brig rat.

1190
01:13:43.08 --> 01:13:49.60
The steady maligner, who, the good for nothing, who is more often in the brig than out of

1191
01:13:49.60 --> 01:13:55.76
it, and who seeks to avoid every consequence of his uniform, even fighting.

1192
01:13:55.76 --> 01:14:01.48
I speak of the young, high-hearted soldier whose very nature is bound to bring him into conflict

1193
01:14:01.48 --> 01:14:07.84
with military discipline and to land him, unless he is exceptionally lucky in the brig.

1194
01:14:07.84 --> 01:14:13.28
I speak of chocolate and chicken and oak stump and a dozen others.

1195
01:14:13.28 --> 01:14:16.80
And of course of myself.

1196
01:14:16.80 --> 01:14:22.28
So he's saying, look, you guys that are high-spirited go-getters, and they're going to get

1197
01:14:22.28 --> 01:14:26.20
after it on the battlefield, and they're going to get after it on the liberty, and sometimes

1198
01:14:26.20 --> 01:14:29.12
they're going to get rolled up unless they're super lucky, and that doesn't make

1199
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:30.12
them bad people.

1200
01:14:30.12 --> 01:14:34.68
And I had one of my buddies getting really big trouble.

1201
01:14:34.68 --> 01:14:38.52
This is when we were young guys.

1202
01:14:38.52 --> 01:14:41.96
Back in the day, back in the day, one of my bros.

1203
01:14:41.96 --> 01:14:47.44
He got in big trouble, and I thought that our officer, who's one of the best officers

1204
01:14:47.44 --> 01:14:52.52
I ever worked for, I thought he was going to really, you know, just crush him and I thought

1205
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:55.32
he's going to be really disappointed in all these horrible things.

1206
01:14:55.32 --> 01:14:56.32
And this is a guy.

1207
01:14:56.32 --> 01:14:59.92
The officers of the guy that we all loved and wanted to always impress, and we wanted

1208
01:14:59.92 --> 01:15:00.92
to do a good job for him.

1209
01:15:00.92 --> 01:15:05.40
And so when my buddy had this big incident that he did, which, you know, he was drunk and

1210
01:15:05.40 --> 01:15:10.56
got crazy and, you know, got arrested and all that, all that bad stuff.

1211
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:16.92
And I talked to our OIC about it in a today's, or you know, is, I mean, what's going to

1212
01:15:16.92 --> 01:15:20.08
happen with my buddy.

1213
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:25.64
And the officer goes, hey, you guys are young warriors and things like this are going

1214
01:15:25.64 --> 01:15:26.64
to happen.

1215
01:15:26.64 --> 01:15:29.24
Don't let him happen much, but they're going to happen.

1216
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:30.52
And we'll deal with it.

1217
01:15:30.52 --> 01:15:31.84
And I'll send myself.

1218
01:15:31.84 --> 01:15:35.60
I don't know why I love this guy so much, but that's exactly it.

1219
01:15:35.60 --> 01:15:42.16
You know, he was he knew that that, you know, you had young, ram-bunks, just guys full

1220
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:48.36
of testosterone and then you add alcohol into the equation and you add chaos into the

1221
01:15:48.36 --> 01:15:51.20
equation, because some guys might control again.

1222
01:15:51.20 --> 01:15:56.000
I hate to, to give that credence to this type of stuff.

1223
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.40
Because when I look back, I wish I would have been a better leader.

1224
01:15:58.40 --> 01:16:03.96
I wish I would have been doing other things, you know, but if you're in a leadership position

1225
01:16:03.96 --> 01:16:07.44
and you've got guys like this and you can demo instead of trying to help them, you're

1226
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:08.44
not helping them.

1227
01:16:08.44 --> 01:16:10.76
It's goes back to this judgment thing that we talked about earlier.

1228
01:16:10.76 --> 01:16:16.84
If I'm looking at you saying, oh, you don't, you don't, you got in trouble.

1229
01:16:16.84 --> 01:16:18.04
You're a bad person.

1230
01:16:18.04 --> 01:16:19.88
I don't want you on this team.

1231
01:16:19.88 --> 01:16:23.20
Instead of saying, hey, look, we got to get you on a control.

1232
01:16:23.20 --> 01:16:24.68
You got the right attitude.

1233
01:16:24.68 --> 01:16:25.68
You got the lot of energy.

1234
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:26.92
Let's focus it on somewhere.

1235
01:16:26.92 --> 01:16:27.92
Correct.

1236
01:16:27.92 --> 01:16:29.76
Let's focus it on something good.

1237
01:16:29.76 --> 01:16:33.48
Let's get you doing something positive instead of doing something negative.

1238
01:16:33.48 --> 01:16:36.56
Instead, sometimes guys go into the judgmental mode.

1239
01:16:36.56 --> 01:16:39.52
You know, I'm just going to judge you and oh, you got in trouble.

1240
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:40.52
So you're bad.

1241
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:42.000
That's the wrong attitude, Dave.

1242
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.12
How about you got in trouble?

1243
01:16:43.12 --> 01:16:44.28
How about me is the leader.

1244
01:16:44.28 --> 01:16:46.04
I let you down.

1245
01:16:46.04 --> 01:16:48.96
I didn't show you the right way to expend your energy.

1246
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:54.08
I didn't give you the opportunity to give you an outlet for this, this aggression that

1247
01:16:54.08 --> 01:16:55.08
you have.

1248
01:16:55.08 --> 01:16:57.72
Because you, aggression you're going to have.

1249
01:16:57.72 --> 01:16:59.48
That means fighting.

1250
01:16:59.48 --> 01:17:00.48
You don't think you get up.

1251
01:17:00.48 --> 01:17:02.92
You get a guy that are in the military.

1252
01:17:02.92 --> 01:17:04.72
Do you want someone in your platoon?

1253
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:06.96
Do you want them to be not aggressive?

1254
01:17:06.96 --> 01:17:07.96
Of course you want.

1255
01:17:07.96 --> 01:17:10.16
I want the most aggressive bastard you can imagine.

1256
01:17:10.16 --> 01:17:11.16
And guess what?

1257
01:17:11.16 --> 01:17:14.04
If you don't give them to something to do with that aggression, they're going to find something

1258
01:17:14.04 --> 01:17:15.04
to do with it.

1259
01:17:15.04 --> 01:17:16.60
And it's not going to be good.

1260
01:17:16.60 --> 01:17:20.32
So as a leader, let's find something positive that they can do with their aggression.

1261
01:17:20.32 --> 01:17:22.88
Yeah, it's not like he's out there.

1262
01:17:22.88 --> 01:17:24.68
Not like it's known.

1263
01:17:24.68 --> 01:17:29.60
Like in your case, you thought he was going to get severely punished.

1264
01:17:29.60 --> 01:17:30.60
Correct.

1265
01:17:30.60 --> 01:17:32.48
It's not like he's out there publicly saying,

1266
01:17:32.48 --> 01:17:33.48
hey, that's cool.

1267
01:17:33.48 --> 01:17:34.48
Dude, what you got to do?

1268
01:17:34.48 --> 01:17:35.48
Play.

1269
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:36.48
You're right.

1270
01:17:36.48 --> 01:17:38.64
But when it happened, yeah, it's like.

1271
01:17:38.64 --> 01:17:44.48
And I think truly that officer who is a great guy, he truly probably felt exactly what

1272
01:17:44.48 --> 01:17:48.32
I just said, I should have given them a better outlet for this aggression.

1273
01:17:48.32 --> 01:17:52.40
You know, I should have let I should have figured something better out for them to do.

1274
01:17:52.40 --> 01:17:54.36
We got to do something.

1275
01:17:54.36 --> 01:17:57.28
You give us idle hands and pockets full of money.

1276
01:17:57.28 --> 01:18:01.72
Can you imagine these guys are getting six months pay and they were the richest guys

1277
01:18:01.72 --> 01:18:02.72
in the world.

1278
01:18:02.72 --> 01:18:03.72
I guarantee it.

1279
01:18:03.72 --> 01:18:06.72
You know, especially rolling into wartime Australia.

1280
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:12.000
I mean, you know how stringent they were with with the restricting the money that people

1281
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.32
were using and spending all over the world to save money for the war.

1282
01:18:15.32 --> 01:18:16.32
And here come these guys in.

1283
01:18:16.32 --> 01:18:17.64
Richest guys ever.

1284
01:18:17.64 --> 01:18:19.92
Heroes of Wall of Canal.

1285
01:18:19.92 --> 01:18:22.24
I think they're going to get after it.

1286
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:24.48
They're going to get after it.

1287
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:27.20
So as leaders, what we need to do is give them a proper outlet.

1288
01:18:27.20 --> 01:18:28.20
Right.

1289
01:18:28.20 --> 01:18:29.20
Because those guys want to get after it.

1290
01:18:29.20 --> 01:18:30.20
But you've got to give them the right way.

1291
01:18:30.20 --> 01:18:31.20
Yeah.

1292
01:18:31.20 --> 01:18:33.60
You know, you've got to give them something positive that they can work on.

1293
01:18:33.60 --> 01:18:37.80
And if you're going to let them do something negative, then let's put some barriers around

1294
01:18:37.80 --> 01:18:42.08
them so they don't get into trouble.

1295
01:18:42.08 --> 01:18:46.60
Wish I would have known this when I was a when I was coming up.

1296
01:18:46.60 --> 01:18:50.60
I would have done more positive stuff and said a more negative stuff.

1297
01:18:50.60 --> 01:18:55.20
So now we get into the trouble piece.

1298
01:18:55.20 --> 01:18:58.68
And these, he's got so many great stories about how these guys, what these guys were going

1299
01:18:58.68 --> 01:19:00.20
through.

1300
01:19:00.20 --> 01:19:02.64
And this, so they're out.

1301
01:19:02.64 --> 01:19:04.32
He's out drinking.

1302
01:19:04.32 --> 01:19:09.44
And one of his buddies, guy that I mentioned before, his name is Chuckler, Chuckler is actually

1303
01:19:09.44 --> 01:19:10.44
on duty.

1304
01:19:10.44 --> 01:19:12.92
So he's standing duty, which means he's uniform.

1305
01:19:12.92 --> 01:19:13.92
He's not allowed to drink.

1306
01:19:13.92 --> 01:19:19.68
He's watching and he's being, you know, he's on duty.

1307
01:19:19.68 --> 01:19:20.84
And so here we go.

1308
01:19:20.84 --> 01:19:25.64
I found Chuckler standing glumly outside the Slop Shoot entrance.

1309
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:31.000
He'd hope for the interior guard where he might sneak a beer or two.

1310
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.20
I'll get you one, I promised.

1311
01:19:33.20 --> 01:19:40.28
I returned with a big glass out of which Chuckler might take a surpetitious sip.

1312
01:19:40.28 --> 01:19:42.48
There were more side elves.

1313
01:19:42.48 --> 01:19:45.12
Until Chuckler said, I got to go to the head.

1314
01:19:45.12 --> 01:19:47.40
Here cover for me.

1315
01:19:47.40 --> 01:19:50.88
He gave me his pistol belt and helmet and made off.

1316
01:19:50.88 --> 01:19:52.56
So now, let these drunk right now.

1317
01:19:52.56 --> 01:19:58.000
Okay, so.

1318
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.04
But Chuckler says, hey man, I'm going to take a piss here, take my helmet, take my pistol,

1319
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:05.84
cover for me.

1320
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:10.32
For a century to be drunk and then to desert as post and surrender as a weapon is to

1321
01:20:10.32 --> 01:20:15.12
combine Cardinal Sin with unforgivable offense.

1322
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:19.08
I was anxiously hoping that he would hurry back.

1323
01:20:19.08 --> 01:20:22.72
But then an unfortunate thing happened.

1324
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:26.76
Lieutenant Ivy League came striding down the corridor.

1325
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:31.20
I say it was unfortunate because Ivy League was the officer of the day.

1326
01:20:31.20 --> 01:20:36.84
More than that, he was still the man who had philched my cigars, the enlisted men's cigars

1327
01:20:36.84 --> 01:20:37.84
if he will.

1328
01:20:37.84 --> 01:20:44.08
So at one point he had gotten hold of some cigars and this officer had taken him.

1329
01:20:44.08 --> 01:20:54.08
And by the way, also Robert Lecky, he's an Irishman and I'm not going to make a generalization.

1330
01:20:54.08 --> 01:20:59.52
Okay, yes, he's a hot tempered Irishman.

1331
01:20:59.52 --> 01:21:03.000
And so he sees this guy and then he's drunk.

1332
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.80
He just got off the gullalacanel and here's what happens.

1333
01:21:06.80 --> 01:21:07.80
Back to the book.

1334
01:21:07.80 --> 01:21:12.64
My anger was nourished by the alcohol within me and I drew Chuckler's pistol and pointed

1335
01:21:12.64 --> 01:21:15.36
at him and said, stop where you are.

1336
01:21:15.36 --> 01:21:25.36
You lousy cigar stealing son of a bitch or I'll blow your gentleman's ass off.

1337
01:21:25.36 --> 01:21:28.56
So not, not good.

1338
01:21:28.56 --> 01:21:37.000
And he ends up getting in pretty significant trouble.

1339
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.40
And he actually gets bread and water.

1340
01:21:39.40 --> 01:21:40.88
Which they still do that in the military.

1341
01:21:40.88 --> 01:21:42.40
They get bread and water.

1342
01:21:42.40 --> 01:21:44.64
You can get he gets bread and water for five days.

1343
01:21:44.64 --> 01:21:46.48
So in the break, bread and water for five days.

1344
01:21:46.48 --> 01:21:50.08
That's the punishment that he gets and he gets docked pay and he gets busted down and

1345
01:21:50.08 --> 01:21:52.08
wreck.

1346
01:21:52.08 --> 01:22:00.68
One time I was on a ship deployed, broken a jury and we were in a seal platoon.

1347
01:22:00.68 --> 01:22:03.48
And I think I've told this story before.

1348
01:22:03.48 --> 01:22:08.04
It was the one where the Marines like we would stay on the ship when we pulled an

1349
01:22:08.04 --> 01:22:14.92
port and it would take like an hour to get off the ship because everyone would be waiting

1350
01:22:14.92 --> 01:22:15.92
in line.

1351
01:22:15.92 --> 01:22:19.32
And so what we would do is we would just work out for that hour hour and a half and

1352
01:22:19.32 --> 01:22:20.32
it would go up.

1353
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:21.32
We could just walk right off the ship.

1354
01:22:21.32 --> 01:22:26.32
Well, in that hour and a half the Marine, this young Marine had gone off the ship and was

1355
01:22:26.32 --> 01:22:31.12
getting carried back onto the ship like passed out drunk covered in puke and an hour and a half.

1356
01:22:31.12 --> 01:22:33.48
So that's what I think of when I figured these poor guys, can you come out and come

1357
01:22:33.48 --> 01:22:34.48
off a bottle canal?

1358
01:22:34.48 --> 01:22:36.92
You haven't even had water for six months.

1359
01:22:36.92 --> 01:22:41.56
Never mind alcohol to the nightmare.

1360
01:22:41.56 --> 01:22:45.56
But and of course they don't punish him too bad.

1361
01:22:45.56 --> 01:22:48.80
Well, they they punish him, but they gotta keep him.

1362
01:22:48.80 --> 01:22:50.44
You know, I mean, he's an able body Marine.

1363
01:22:50.44 --> 01:22:53.24
They're not gonna, they're not gonna waste an able body Marine.

1364
01:22:53.24 --> 01:22:56.84
And hopefully the Colonel in the back of his mind was thinking of himself, you know what?

1365
01:22:56.84 --> 01:22:59.68
I want this guy and my, I want this guy with me.

1366
01:22:59.68 --> 01:23:02.76
You know, this guy that's just gonna, you stole cigars from me?

1367
01:23:02.76 --> 01:23:03.76
Cool.

1368
01:23:03.76 --> 01:23:04.96
I'm gonna, I'm not threatening your life.

1369
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:07.68
Yeah, I'm just getting nuts.

1370
01:23:07.68 --> 01:23:14.28
So they, but now Australia ends, they roll back out and it's time for them to start

1371
01:23:14.28 --> 01:23:17.48
getting prepared to, they go to, they go to New Guinea.

1372
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:22.68
And if you remember New Guinea, that's another hard battle was fought there primarily by

1373
01:23:22.68 --> 01:23:23.68
the Australians.

1374
01:23:23.68 --> 01:23:31.12
It don't know just primarily, but the Australians definitely fought because I read that letter

1375
01:23:31.12 --> 01:23:33.68
from the Australian soldier to his two year old daughter.

1376
01:23:33.68 --> 01:23:41.12
That's where he died was a New Guinea, but now New Guinea is owned by the Allies and they

1377
01:23:41.12 --> 01:23:45.28
go there to train to start to prepare for their next big push.

1378
01:23:45.28 --> 01:23:46.64
And here we go back to the book.

1379
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:52.20
The truck climbed a series of small hills and finally deposited us in the middle of

1380
01:23:52.20 --> 01:23:56.40
a field of Kuhnai grass, our new home.

1381
01:23:56.40 --> 01:23:59.04
This is how the Marines train their men.

1382
01:23:59.04 --> 01:24:06.12
Keep the mean and nasty like starving beasts says the core and they will fight better.

1383
01:24:06.12 --> 01:24:11.56
When men are being moved from one place to another, spare no effort to make it painful.

1384
01:24:11.56 --> 01:24:16.000
And before they've arrived at their destination, dispatch a man ahead to survey the

1385
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.56
ground with an eye toward diff discomfort.

1386
01:24:19.56 --> 01:24:22.80
So you hear this all the time that that's the Marine Corps.

1387
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:25.36
The Marine Corps is gonna make you so pissed off.

1388
01:24:25.36 --> 01:24:28.36
By the time you go into battle, you're just gonna kill everybody.

1389
01:24:28.36 --> 01:24:32.68
Because you're so sick of living in the dirt.

1390
01:24:32.68 --> 01:24:41.16
Now they do a decent amount of training and now they're preparing to assault another island

1391
01:24:41.16 --> 01:24:42.64
called New Britain.

1392
01:24:42.64 --> 01:24:44.36
This is I found this very interesting.

1393
01:24:44.36 --> 01:24:46.96
So back to the book.

1394
01:24:46.96 --> 01:24:52.68
The commander called us together that night delivered an eve of battle speech.

1395
01:24:52.68 --> 01:24:55.72
He spoke in deliberate but angry tones.

1396
01:24:55.72 --> 01:25:01.64
He spoke like a man who hated the Japanese as though he had suffered a personal affront

1397
01:25:01.64 --> 01:25:06.40
at their hands and was bent on personal vengeance.

1398
01:25:06.40 --> 01:25:12.04
As though this were a personal, not mechanical war.

1399
01:25:12.04 --> 01:25:14.32
His harang seemed unreal.

1400
01:25:14.32 --> 01:25:19.96
It was unreal because it could never produce the desired effect.

1401
01:25:19.96 --> 01:25:20.96
Kill the Japs.

1402
01:25:20.96 --> 01:25:25.16
The commander was saying, I want you to kill Japs and I want you to remember that you're

1403
01:25:25.16 --> 01:25:26.80
the Marines.

1404
01:25:26.80 --> 01:25:31.08
We've got a tough job where we're going and where we're going, you won't have much

1405
01:25:31.08 --> 01:25:32.72
room for ammunition.

1406
01:25:32.72 --> 01:25:38.04
So you'd better be sure you see something before you shoot.

1407
01:25:38.04 --> 01:25:42.08
Don't squeeze the trigger until you've got meat in your sights.

1408
01:25:42.08 --> 01:25:49.56
And when you do spill blood, spill yellow blood.

1409
01:25:49.56 --> 01:25:51.44
That was all.

1410
01:25:51.44 --> 01:25:54.56
We walked back to the tents.

1411
01:25:54.56 --> 01:25:57.04
It was Christmas Eve.

1412
01:25:57.04 --> 01:25:58.44
And I find this.

1413
01:25:58.44 --> 01:25:59.60
It's Christmas Eve.

1414
01:25:59.60 --> 01:26:02.24
He gets this speech and you can see like he's sitting here.

1415
01:26:02.24 --> 01:26:06.60
There's thinking, okay, this guy's trying to get him all riled up and it's not having any

1416
01:26:06.60 --> 01:26:09.08
impact.

1417
01:26:09.08 --> 01:26:15.000
And this is what I found to be the real dichotomy here at the tents.

1418
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.44
Father's straight was preparing to say midnight mass.

1419
01:26:18.44 --> 01:26:23.68
So they have a japan there, Catholic japan father's straight.

1420
01:26:23.68 --> 01:26:29.04
And here's what he says, Father's straight spoke gently.

1421
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:34.60
He reminded us that not all of us would live to see another Christmas that perhaps some

1422
01:26:34.60 --> 01:26:38.80
of us might die this very day.

1423
01:26:38.80 --> 01:26:44.20
He told us to be sorry for our sins to ask the forgiveness of God, to forgive those who

1424
01:26:44.20 --> 01:26:51.92
had wronged us, to prepare our souls for death.

1425
01:26:51.92 --> 01:26:59.52
We sang hymns, nineteen hundred and forty odd years ago, the babe had been born and Bethlehem

1426
01:26:59.52 --> 01:27:08.64
and we celebrated him this night in a dark and misty forest that his father had wrought.

1427
01:27:08.64 --> 01:27:19.80
We sang hymns to him, silent night and hark the herald angel sing, mild the he lays his glory

1428
01:27:19.80 --> 01:27:27.36
by born that man no more may die.

1429
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:34.32
And tomorrow our hands would be stained with the blood of our brothers.

1430
01:27:34.32 --> 01:27:41.68
But we sang on half-heartedly, half hopingly, sometimes mechanically, sometimes with a desperate

1431
01:27:41.68 --> 01:27:56.000
driving poignancy one hand on the heart, the other on the hilt of a bayonet in the morning,

1432
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.56
we marched down to the ships.

1433
01:28:03.56 --> 01:28:10.88
So much more impactful on him was what father straight and much more than the fiery kernel

1434
01:28:10.88 --> 01:28:13.28
that said we're going to go kill japs here.

1435
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:21.54
These guys are, I mean can you imagine you go in for comfort to midnight mass, Christmas

1436
01:28:21.54 --> 01:28:31.48
Eve and you get told that many people, many of you may die this very day and to prepare

1437
01:28:31.48 --> 01:28:33.92
your soul for death.

1438
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:35.52
That's what these guys are facing.

1439
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:40.20
That's what they're most trusted, the most trusted person in their lives, right?

1440
01:28:40.20 --> 01:28:43.72
Their spiritual counselor is telling them prepare for death.

1441
01:28:43.72 --> 01:28:51.000
Yeah, kind of like we'll talk about sometimes where you get a guy, like if you're watching

1442
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.24
a video and it's a guy getting you fired up, he's getting fired up to get you fired

1443
01:28:55.24 --> 01:28:59.28
up, sometimes they can work but a lot of times that won't really work because you kind

1444
01:28:59.28 --> 01:29:02.16
of feel like he's trying to sell you something.

1445
01:29:02.16 --> 01:29:06.48
But then if you hear someone maybe even talking to someone else or talking about something

1446
01:29:06.48 --> 01:29:12.24
else and you just kind of extrapolate certain things that get you fired up because it's

1447
01:29:12.24 --> 01:29:13.24
so authentic.

1448
01:29:13.24 --> 01:29:16.28
It's basically the indirect approach on your own mind.

1449
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:18.000
Yeah, and right, from mind.

1450
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:18.52
Yes.

1451
01:29:18.52 --> 01:29:27.16
Back to the book on the sunless shores of New Britain where the rainforest crowded steeply

1452
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:33.40
down to the sea, we of the first Marine Division came back to the assault and it was here

1453
01:29:33.40 --> 01:29:39.48
that we cut the Japanese to pieces literally when that devouring jungle did not dissolve

1454
01:29:39.48 --> 01:29:40.48
them.

1455
01:29:40.48 --> 01:29:45.16
And it was here that we pitted them.

1456
01:29:45.16 --> 01:29:53.04
Now to pity the enemy is either madness or is it a sign or it is a sign of strength.

1457
01:29:53.04 --> 01:30:00.40
I think that with the first Marine Division on New Britain, it was a sign of strength.

1458
01:30:00.40 --> 01:30:08.64
He pitted him in the end this fleeing foe disorganized, demoralized crawling on hands

1459
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:14.64
and knees even in that dissolving downpour.

1460
01:30:14.64 --> 01:30:20.92
For in the end it was we.

1461
01:30:20.92 --> 01:30:28.24
The soft of feet Americans who had learned to get along in the jungle and who bore up

1462
01:30:28.24 --> 01:30:40.60
the best beneath the ordeal of the monsoon and in these things lay our strength.

1463
01:30:40.60 --> 01:30:43.88
And I'll tell you what I think that boils down to.

1464
01:30:43.88 --> 01:30:46.80
So what they're saying here is these, you know, the Americans, what do people around

1465
01:30:46.80 --> 01:30:48.16
the world think of the Americans?

1466
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:51.68
Even in 1943, Americans are soft.

1467
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:53.68
Americans are lazy Americans.

1468
01:30:53.68 --> 01:30:55.000
They have too much comfort.

1469
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.96
And you think the exact opposite of the Japanese, especially in World War II, the Imperial

1470
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:05.96
Japanese Army, it was highly disciplined, it was extremely strict, it was a Spartan lifestyle.

1471
01:31:05.96 --> 01:31:09.32
But look at what happened here and why is that?

1472
01:31:09.32 --> 01:31:11.36
And I'll tell you why.

1473
01:31:11.36 --> 01:31:13.96
In my opinion, I will tell you why.

1474
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:18.52
Because you have men that are fighting for freedom.

1475
01:31:18.52 --> 01:31:20.40
They're fighting for freedom.

1476
01:31:20.40 --> 01:31:25.96
And that makes all the difference in the world fighting for individual freedom, fighting for

1477
01:31:25.96 --> 01:31:30.04
their personal freedom and fighting for their nations freedom and fighting for their nations

1478
01:31:30.04 --> 01:31:34.20
freedom and its nation that is based upon freedom.

1479
01:31:34.20 --> 01:31:49.36
That right there is stronger than any tyrannical government or any fanatical idea.

1480
01:31:49.36 --> 01:31:52.64
The idea of freedom is stronger than the most.

1481
01:31:52.64 --> 01:32:02.08
And that is why these quote, soft Americans, that is why they were able to conquer and

1482
01:32:02.08 --> 01:32:03.52
defeat this enemy.

1483
01:32:03.52 --> 01:32:12.60
This hardened enemy, this well-trained enemy.

1484
01:32:12.60 --> 01:32:19.12
And this talks a little bit about what we were facing.

1485
01:32:19.12 --> 01:32:23.76
To the north one patrol discovered the body of an e-companies scout who had been reported

1486
01:32:23.76 --> 01:32:25.56
missing.

1487
01:32:25.56 --> 01:32:30.60
The area bore the marks of a struggle as though we had fought hand to hand.

1488
01:32:30.60 --> 01:32:38.000
His body bore dozens of bayonet wounds, they had used him for bayonet practice.

1489
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.52
In his mouth, they had stuffed flesh, they had cut from his arm.

1490
01:32:43.52 --> 01:32:46.28
His buddy said he had a tattoo there.

1491
01:32:46.28 --> 01:32:52.04
The marine emblem, the fouled anchor, and the globe.

1492
01:32:52.04 --> 01:32:57.80
The japs cut it off and stuffed it in his mouth.

1493
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:01.72
The commander was angry.

1494
01:33:01.72 --> 01:33:06.64
Again to the north, two Japanese officers had been caught snooping around our positions

1495
01:33:06.64 --> 01:33:09.32
and had been killed.

1496
01:33:09.32 --> 01:33:13.80
An e-companie outpost scouting the terrain at their front and discovered a Japanese force

1497
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:19.40
in platoon strength, sleeping, sleeping on the ground, sleeping.

1498
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:27.20
They fired into them into these sleeping supermen of the jungle with drawing upon the approach

1499
01:33:27.20 --> 01:33:35.68
of another enemy platoon.

1500
01:33:35.68 --> 01:33:42.68
And after this, after the bulk of the battle takes place and it was fair.

1501
01:33:42.68 --> 01:33:47.96
It was not a fair fight and you're about to find out why.

1502
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:52.52
Back to the book, four Japanese soldiers and one officer had been taken alive and had been

1503
01:33:52.52 --> 01:33:57.80
brought down to the CP, their arms bound behind them knives at their throats and from them

1504
01:33:57.80 --> 01:34:03.24
we learned that the third company, 53rd Regiment of the Japanese 17th Division, had been

1505
01:34:03.24 --> 01:34:10.44
dispatched from the main body at Cape Clouster to defend against our landing.

1506
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:15.84
The passage had been through near imprenetrable jungle and they had not arrived on the scene

1507
01:34:15.84 --> 01:34:20.44
until two days after our own coming.

1508
01:34:20.44 --> 01:34:23.48
Nevertheless, they attacked us.

1509
01:34:23.48 --> 01:34:30.08
They attacked us, some 100 of them against our force of some 1200 and but for the prisoners

1510
01:34:30.08 --> 01:34:33.72
we had annihilated them.

1511
01:34:33.72 --> 01:34:35.84
Were they brave or fanatical?

1512
01:34:35.84 --> 01:34:37.80
What had they hoped to gain?

1513
01:34:37.80 --> 01:34:41.76
Did their commander really believe that a company of Japanese soldiers could conquer a battalion

1514
01:34:41.76 --> 01:34:47.88
of American Marines experienced confident, better armed and placed on higher ground?

1515
01:34:47.88 --> 01:34:51.24
Why did not turn around and march his men home again?

1516
01:34:51.24 --> 01:34:54.64
Was it because no Japanese soldier can report failure?

1517
01:34:54.64 --> 01:34:58.12
Cannot lose face?

1518
01:34:58.12 --> 01:35:01.08
I cannot answer.

1519
01:35:01.08 --> 01:35:07.76
Our dead were six men among them the stubby and trepured OB, whom I'd last seen in Melbourne

1520
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:12.92
and so drunk he could barely stand, whose gun pit had been overrun when the japs overwhelmed

1521
01:35:12.92 --> 01:35:17.000
the section of the lines and their first silent rush up the hillside.

1522
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.40
OB, who had helped to drive them out in the counter attack and who had been alternatingly

1523
01:35:23.40 --> 01:35:29.32
firing and hurling implications at them until one of their bullets took him squarely in the

1524
01:35:29.32 --> 01:35:32.32
forehead.

1525
01:35:32.32 --> 01:35:35.24
May he rest in peace.

1526
01:35:35.24 --> 01:35:40.08
The Japanese dead lay in heaps on the hillside and they filled the trench where OB's

1527
01:35:40.08 --> 01:35:48.76
gun had been located.

1528
01:35:48.76 --> 01:35:54.56
So that shows the will of the Japanese fighters no doubt about it.

1529
01:35:54.56 --> 01:36:00.12
They were hard core and they got told to attack with a hundred eyes against nine hundred

1530
01:36:00.12 --> 01:36:05.20
or twelve hundred and they said, alright, let's do this.

1531
01:36:05.20 --> 01:36:15.20
Now, the life, the existence in this jungle was harsh back to the book.

1532
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:20.88
The puffing of my lips and eyes symbolized the mystery and poison of this terrible island.

1533
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:26.24
Mysterious, perhaps I mean to say new Britain was evil, darkly and secretly evil, a

1534
01:36:26.24 --> 01:36:30.40
malifactor and enemy of humankind.

1535
01:36:30.40 --> 01:36:36.64
An adversary really dissolving, corroding, poisoning, chilling, sucking, drenching, coming

1536
01:36:36.64 --> 01:36:42.66
at a man with its rolling, mist, green mold and ceaseless downpour, tripping him with his

1537
01:36:42.66 --> 01:36:48.42
numberless roots and vines, poisoning him with green insects and bugs and treacherous

1538
01:36:48.42 --> 01:36:54.36
tree bark, turning the sun from his bones and cheer from his heart dissolving him.

1539
01:36:54.36 --> 01:37:01.40
The rain, the mold, the damp steadily pucking each, plucking each cell apart like tiny hands

1540
01:37:01.40 --> 01:37:05.08
tearing at the petals of a flower, dissolving him.

1541
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:12.24
I say into a mindless, formless fluid like the sop of mud into which his feet forever fall

1542
01:37:12.24 --> 01:37:19.16
in a monotonous, slopsuck, slopsuck, that is the sound of nothingness, the song of the jungle

1543
01:37:19.16 --> 01:37:26.44
wherein everything falls apart in hollow harmony with the rain.

1544
01:37:26.44 --> 01:37:28.04
Nothing could stand against it.

1545
01:37:28.04 --> 01:37:32.12
A letter home had to be read and re-read and memorized for a fell apart in your pocket

1546
01:37:32.12 --> 01:37:33.28
in less than a week.

1547
01:37:33.28 --> 01:37:35.72
A pair of socks lasted no longer.

1548
01:37:35.72 --> 01:37:41.08
A pack of cigarettes became sodden and worthless unless smoked that day.

1549
01:37:41.08 --> 01:37:45.92
Pocket knife blades rusted together, watches recorded the period of their own decay.

1550
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:51.40
Rain made garbage of the food, pencil swelled and burst apart, fountain pens clogged and

1551
01:37:51.40 --> 01:37:52.84
their points separated.

1552
01:37:52.84 --> 01:37:56.84
Rifle barrels turned blue with mold and had to be slung upside down to keep out the

1553
01:37:56.84 --> 01:37:57.84
rain.

1554
01:37:57.84 --> 01:38:01.84
Bullets stuck together in rifle magazines and machine gunners had to go over their belts

1555
01:38:01.84 --> 01:38:06.44
daily, extracting and oiling and reinserting the bullets to prevent them from sticking

1556
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:08.24
to the cloth loops.

1557
01:38:08.24 --> 01:38:13.96
And everything lay, damp and sodden and squashed to the touch, exuding that steady musty

1558
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:19.96
weak that is the jungle's own, that individual odor of decay rising from vegetable life

1559
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:25.84
so luxurious and growing so swiftly that it seems to hasten the decomposition from the

1560
01:38:25.84 --> 01:38:28.84
moment of birth.

1561
01:38:28.84 --> 01:38:33.76
It was into this green hell that we were inserted a day or two after the march.

1562
01:38:33.76 --> 01:38:37.64
And here was fought that battle with the rain forest.

1563
01:38:37.64 --> 01:38:43.28
Here the jungle and the men were locked in conflict far more basic than our shooting

1564
01:38:43.28 --> 01:38:45.52
war the Japanese for here.

1565
01:38:45.52 --> 01:38:51.12
The struggle was for existence itself.

1566
01:38:51.12 --> 01:38:56.56
The war was forgotten who could comprehend it.

1567
01:38:56.56 --> 01:39:02.20
Who cared.

1568
01:39:02.20 --> 01:39:07.40
And what do you say?

1569
01:39:07.40 --> 01:39:09.40
And I have not spent that much time in the jungle.

1570
01:39:09.40 --> 01:39:15.96
I spent some, I think the longs I've been in the jungle is maybe a month and it wasn't

1571
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:16.96
as bad as this.

1572
01:39:16.96 --> 01:39:19.24
It wasn't raining as that much.

1573
01:39:19.24 --> 01:39:24.40
But I can't even imagine just that constant.

1574
01:39:24.40 --> 01:39:26.16
There's no escape from it.

1575
01:39:26.16 --> 01:39:27.64
There's no escape from it.

1576
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:31.64
And it's even worse for leki and I'll tell you why.

1577
01:39:31.64 --> 01:39:33.32
Back to the book.

1578
01:39:33.32 --> 01:39:37.24
I would be wet not only from the rain.

1579
01:39:37.24 --> 01:39:41.48
There's sometimes it stopped and at other times it did not fall so fast that a jungle

1580
01:39:41.48 --> 01:39:43.92
hammock could not repel it.

1581
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:49.000
But because an affliction which I had begun, which had begun the moment I left Australia,

1582
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.76
was now again active.

1583
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:57.88
It had begun during the discomforts of grotto can now had disappeared in the civilized

1584
01:39:57.88 --> 01:40:02.16
living of Melbourne and had reappeared.

1585
01:40:02.16 --> 01:40:09.40
On good enough island, New Guinea and now on New Britain.

1586
01:40:09.40 --> 01:40:15.24
I learned later from doctors to call it an e-reases.

1587
01:40:15.24 --> 01:40:18.64
Winnersleep, the bladder empties.

1588
01:40:18.64 --> 01:40:22.72
And that is that.

1589
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:26.36
So he puts that really nicely.

1590
01:40:26.36 --> 01:40:28.72
But here's what's going on.

1591
01:40:28.72 --> 01:40:33.28
This is the stress that he's under when he goes to bed.

1592
01:40:33.28 --> 01:40:36.24
He pisses in his pants.

1593
01:40:36.24 --> 01:40:41.76
And it's just he can't stop it.

1594
01:40:41.76 --> 01:40:44.64
There's nothing he can do about it.

1595
01:40:44.64 --> 01:40:48.64
And it won't go away.

1596
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:50.04
In fact, it went away.

1597
01:40:50.04 --> 01:40:52.80
It will go away when the stress stops.

1598
01:40:52.80 --> 01:40:54.28
When he went to Melbourne, it's all good.

1599
01:40:54.28 --> 01:40:55.44
It stops.

1600
01:40:55.44 --> 01:40:59.40
It's going to go away when he gets back out there in the stress of combat, the stress of the environment.

1601
01:40:59.40 --> 01:41:04.24
And when he goes to bed, he pisses himself.

1602
01:41:04.24 --> 01:41:15.12
And certainly he made a decision to put that in this book for a reason.

1603
01:41:15.12 --> 01:41:18.76
And there is, it does fall into the story a little bit.

1604
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:24.92
But the reason I love that he put it in there is because it's just another thing.

1605
01:41:24.92 --> 01:41:26.36
He's dealing with.

1606
01:41:26.36 --> 01:41:27.76
And he's not even ashamed of it.

1607
01:41:27.76 --> 01:41:32.96
He said, yeah, I'm stressed out.

1608
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:34.60
Scared.

1609
01:41:34.60 --> 01:41:35.60
And I'm pissing myself.

1610
01:41:35.60 --> 01:41:36.60
But guess what?

1611
01:41:36.60 --> 01:41:41.92
I'm still going on patrol.

1612
01:41:41.92 --> 01:41:42.92
Back to the book.

1613
01:41:42.92 --> 01:41:45.76
The last patrol was a prolonged one of several days.

1614
01:41:45.76 --> 01:41:52.40
We were taken by landing boat down the east coast to a place called Old Notamo.

1615
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:54.88
And there deposited.

1616
01:41:54.88 --> 01:42:02.12
The place had once been inhabited by the Japs, but all their emplacements were now empty.

1617
01:42:02.12 --> 01:42:08.40
Those of the enemy who were discovered were in the last extremities of Ordeal.

1618
01:42:08.40 --> 01:42:12.04
Some were overtaken, crawling on their hands and knees.

1619
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:18.08
Some so badly decomposed it was as though their feet were rotting off.

1620
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:21.16
Some weighing perhaps no more than 80 pounds.

1621
01:42:21.16 --> 01:42:28.76
Some were not weapons, all without food and all possessed of that indelentible fighting spirit.

1622
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:33.04
That was the Japanese Imperial Army's greatest asset.

1623
01:42:33.04 --> 01:42:40.72
The one single factor that made a poorly equipped soldier a first-rate foe.

1624
01:42:40.72 --> 01:42:43.000
They all resisted.

1625
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.64
And they were all destroyed, bayoneted for the most part.

1626
01:42:47.64 --> 01:42:55.48
It was file for it was folly to fire on patrol in unfriendly unknown territory.

1627
01:42:55.48 --> 01:43:00.84
One of these stragglers was strangled and cold blood by the kid, a youngster who, although

1628
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:07.20
already a veteran of gullal can now, was hardly acquainted with a razor.

1629
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:11.88
He would go mad two months later.

1630
01:43:11.88 --> 01:43:19.16
So they come up across these Japanese, total 80 pounds malnourished.

1631
01:43:19.16 --> 01:43:27.56
Some of them didn't even have weapons and they're just trying to fight anyways.

1632
01:43:27.56 --> 01:43:30.52
He ends up with a hernia.

1633
01:43:30.52 --> 01:43:34.28
It's a leaky, ends up with a hernia.

1634
01:43:34.28 --> 01:43:40.04
And he gets pulled off to go take a look at his hernia.

1635
01:43:40.04 --> 01:43:42.96
And they say, yeah, you got a bad hernia.

1636
01:43:42.96 --> 01:43:43.96
But it's not bad enough.

1637
01:43:43.96 --> 01:43:47.32
You're going back to the front.

1638
01:43:47.32 --> 01:43:50.92
Then the army comes and replaces them there.

1639
01:43:50.92 --> 01:43:57.80
And next thing, next move is they go to train at a place called Pavuvo.

1640
01:43:57.80 --> 01:44:04.36
Pavu Islander doing another training to get ready for another island campaign.

1641
01:44:04.36 --> 01:44:05.48
And here we go back to the book.

1642
01:44:05.48 --> 01:44:07.08
The food was bad too.

1643
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:09.44
And the tents were rotten and punctured with holes.

1644
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:13.44
There was no water, except for what was caught in her helmets during the night.

1645
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:17.92
We bathed by dashing naked into the rain, soaping ourselves, madly in a race against the

1646
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:23.52
probability of the rain ceasing and being left streaked with sticky stope soap.

1647
01:44:23.52 --> 01:44:28.08
And we washed our clothes by boiling them in cans of rain water.

1648
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:33.24
Our jungle rot had become so bad, so persistent that there was an appointed time each

1649
01:44:33.24 --> 01:44:38.20
afternoon for the men to take off their shoes and socks and to lie out on their sacks with

1650
01:44:38.20 --> 01:44:42.68
corrosive feet thrust out into the sun.

1651
01:44:42.68 --> 01:44:45.80
But we had borne all this before.

1652
01:44:45.80 --> 01:44:47.76
And we could bear it again.

1653
01:44:47.76 --> 01:44:54.12
Nor could mere bad food or leaky tents press upon the ardor of my comrades.

1654
01:44:54.12 --> 01:44:58.72
It was the death of hope that bore us down.

1655
01:44:58.72 --> 01:45:05.76
There had always been hope, hope of relief, hope of the sun, hope of victory, hope of survival.

1656
01:45:05.76 --> 01:45:11.36
But when they came and told us that none of us were going home on rotation, we strangled

1657
01:45:11.36 --> 01:45:15.44
hope and turned into wooden soldiers.

1658
01:45:15.44 --> 01:45:23.20
The future looked to innumerable enemy held islands and innumerable assaults and we had already

1659
01:45:23.20 --> 01:45:28.88
noticed how the ranks of the new river originals were dwindling with every action.

1660
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:35.72
There were even a few suicides to suggest how to spare some could find the situation.

1661
01:45:35.72 --> 01:45:41.60
Then the thing changed.

1662
01:45:41.60 --> 01:45:45.88
They came and said half of the originals could go home.

1663
01:45:45.88 --> 01:45:47.44
So these guys get to word.

1664
01:45:47.44 --> 01:45:53.92
Hey look, we're praying for another salt, but half of you originals are going to go home.

1665
01:45:53.92 --> 01:46:01.44
There was joy and then once the method of selection for the state side bound became known,

1666
01:46:01.44 --> 01:46:03.72
there was anger.

1667
01:46:03.72 --> 01:46:10.40
There would be a drawing, a state side lottery, in which men's names were repold from a hat.

1668
01:46:10.40 --> 01:46:15.40
But only the names of those who had never been in trouble.

1669
01:46:15.40 --> 01:46:20.88
I was among those whose name did not go into the hat, and so was runner and housher and

1670
01:46:20.88 --> 01:46:24.84
chicken and souvenirs and a host of others.

1671
01:46:24.84 --> 01:46:29.32
It seemed that the originals of the second battalion first marines had been neatly divided

1672
01:46:29.32 --> 01:46:33.40
into good guys and bad guys.

1673
01:46:33.40 --> 01:46:37.96
Among us they raged a profane anger.

1674
01:46:37.96 --> 01:46:43.60
I know now how a convict must feel upon being turned down a job after being turned

1675
01:46:43.60 --> 01:46:47.80
down a job after job because of its past.

1676
01:46:47.80 --> 01:46:50.72
That was what disqualified us our past.

1677
01:46:50.72 --> 01:46:53.28
It made no difference that we had been punished.

1678
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:58.64
Yes, punished again and again for to become customary to solve all problems of selection

1679
01:46:58.64 --> 01:47:07.52
this way by marking brig rats for dirty duty and excluding them from special benefits.

1680
01:47:07.52 --> 01:47:16.000
Nor did it matter that we had good war records.

1681
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.88
In retrospect, it's easy to forgive my commanders this, but then it was hard.

1682
01:47:22.88 --> 01:47:28.56
It was too much like being unfairly condemned to death.

1683
01:47:28.56 --> 01:47:33.64
The injustice of it overwhelmed me and I burned with a resentment that was dangerous to carry

1684
01:47:33.64 --> 01:47:37.44
around.

1685
01:47:37.44 --> 01:47:39.60
So what a one.

1686
01:47:39.60 --> 01:47:41.84
What a nightmare.

1687
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:43.48
They say look we're going to have a little lottery.

1688
01:47:43.48 --> 01:47:46.44
Some of you guys are going to get a home everyone's happy and say by the way if you've

1689
01:47:46.44 --> 01:47:49.84
been in any trouble you don't get on the list.

1690
01:47:49.84 --> 01:47:51.24
That's a death sentence.

1691
01:47:51.24 --> 01:47:52.44
The way he's seen it.

1692
01:47:52.44 --> 01:47:53.44
There's a death sentence.

1693
01:47:53.44 --> 01:47:56.44
I'm going to keep doing this island hopping campaign.

1694
01:47:56.44 --> 01:47:57.68
We're going to keep going.

1695
01:47:57.68 --> 01:48:01.12
There's all these innumerable islands that need to be taken down.

1696
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:05.20
You're going to be on all of them and you've already seen X number of guys that you had

1697
01:48:05.20 --> 01:48:08.48
killed and you're going to keep going until you're killed.

1698
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:10.24
So this was like a death sentence.

1699
01:48:10.24 --> 01:48:14.56
Meanwhile the guys who might be able to go there just they're right there.

1700
01:48:14.56 --> 01:48:18.000
And you're right next to you.

1701
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.20
And those guys probably did a lot of the same crap.

1702
01:48:22.20 --> 01:48:32.72
Yeah, yeah, so the back to the book, my and your recess was more noticeable than before.

1703
01:48:32.72 --> 01:48:36.72
Perhaps to the agitation of the moment aggravated it.

1704
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:41.12
I know that the men in my tent had been urging me to report it to sick bay.

1705
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:47.000
I did the doctor who knew of my case ordered me to banika.

1706
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:47.96
I was leaving in the morning.

1707
01:48:47.96 --> 01:48:54.64
So with that, he basically says, okay, you know what, I'm pissing on myself.

1708
01:48:54.64 --> 01:48:57.000
The guys have been telling me to go see the doctor about it.

1709
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.84
I haven't done that.

1710
01:48:58.84 --> 01:49:00.28
I have a hernia.

1711
01:49:00.28 --> 01:49:01.68
I'm going to go to medical.

1712
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:04.88
So he goes to medical and the doctor says, okay, you're going to go to banika.

1713
01:49:04.88 --> 01:49:12.96
And banika is a is a island where they just are set up to handle wounded.

1714
01:49:12.96 --> 01:49:19.68
And when he gets to banika, it's it's kind of shocking back to the book.

1715
01:49:19.68 --> 01:49:21.24
Banika was a flesh pot.

1716
01:49:21.24 --> 01:49:22.92
Banika was the big town.

1717
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:25.20
Banika was Broadway.

1718
01:49:25.20 --> 01:49:26.36
Banika had women.

1719
01:49:26.36 --> 01:49:28.64
It had buildings of steel and wood.

1720
01:49:28.64 --> 01:49:29.64
It had roads.

1721
01:49:29.64 --> 01:49:35.12
It had thousands of sailors as sleek as campans.

1722
01:49:35.12 --> 01:49:37.60
It had movie amphitheaters.

1723
01:49:37.60 --> 01:49:42.92
It had electric lights.

1724
01:49:42.92 --> 01:49:47.52
It had canteens overflowing with candy and comforts.

1725
01:49:47.52 --> 01:49:49.52
Banika had beer.

1726
01:49:49.52 --> 01:49:52.92
Walking with the others from the beach to the navy hospital, I felt like a hick on his first

1727
01:49:52.92 --> 01:49:54.36
visit to New York.

1728
01:49:54.36 --> 01:50:00.12
Jeeps and trucks and staff cars swept over the islands, roads, raising a busy cloud of dust,

1729
01:50:00.12 --> 01:50:04.12
cranes, croaked and cranked on the beach, loading and unloading the boats.

1730
01:50:04.12 --> 01:50:10.04
And peas patrol the stockade of pointed sticks behind which, to well, the women.

1731
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:14.08
The navy nurses and red crossworkers.

1732
01:50:14.08 --> 01:50:17.08
Everyone was well fed and unwured.

1733
01:50:17.08 --> 01:50:23.48
The seat of every pair of pants was filled and happy.

1734
01:50:23.48 --> 01:50:30.000
We, the lean ones, who wore our discontent on our faces and carried our nervous impatience

1735
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.84
in our hands, must have been a disturbing presence in that pouring island incubator.

1736
01:50:36.84 --> 01:50:44.56
Yet as I walked along, I was filled with the uneasy suspicion that it would be the image

1737
01:50:44.56 --> 01:50:53.16
of Banika and not pervue that would be presented to America as the Pacific War.

1738
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:57.48
They do that pretty good job of this in the series.

1739
01:50:57.48 --> 01:51:03.000
That is good as they could have done because they show the guys coming on to a beach and

1740
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.40
there's nurses and they're dressed in like a beautiful clean white and they're literally

1741
01:51:06.40 --> 01:51:11.36
handing out lemonade and it's such a contradiction to what they've been living.

1742
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:16.84
So you get that, but this image is even crazier in my mind of coming on this island.

1743
01:51:16.84 --> 01:51:20.92
You become an off-pavu voo voo, you're living in the hell.

1744
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:24.68
And here these guys are whatever a quick flight away and they've got movie theaters and

1745
01:51:24.68 --> 01:51:27.08
they've got beer and they've got women running around.

1746
01:51:27.08 --> 01:51:29.72
It's just totally, totally different.

1747
01:51:29.72 --> 01:51:31.48
And I've talked about that a bunch of times in here.

1748
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:35.04
You could be, you could be in World War II.

1749
01:51:35.04 --> 01:51:39.44
But if you were on the island of Banika, wasn't that much of a sacrifice as it was compared

1750
01:51:39.44 --> 01:51:41.68
to somebody that was on the island-happened campaign?

1751
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:42.68
It's not.

1752
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:43.68
And it's the same thing.

1753
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:47.000
There's places I wasn't Iraq where I would say, God, this is crazy.

1754
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
How nice this is.

1755
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.80
They got a swimming pool.

1756
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:53.32
The baits some of the baits said swimming pools.

1757
01:51:53.32 --> 01:51:54.32
They got a nice gym.

1758
01:51:54.32 --> 01:51:55.32
They got a nice childhood.

1759
01:51:55.32 --> 01:52:01.16
Then you go out to some outstation in the middle of some forward operating base.

1760
01:52:01.16 --> 01:52:09.48
And these dudes would be living hard, totally different for different people.

1761
01:52:09.48 --> 01:52:15.36
Now leki gets put basically into a psych ward.

1762
01:52:15.36 --> 01:52:16.92
They want to look at him.

1763
01:52:16.92 --> 01:52:23.000
And he starts having this conversation with a psychologist.

1764
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.16
And I think this is a very important conversation.

1765
01:52:27.16 --> 01:52:28.16
Back to the book.

1766
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:31.24
He began to question me about my experiences in war.

1767
01:52:31.24 --> 01:52:35.84
And as I told them to him, he shook his head from side to side as though to indicate that

1768
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.16
my whole division not only myself ought to be psychoanalyzed.

1769
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:45.96
Then we talked of books for he was well read and philosophy.

1770
01:52:45.96 --> 01:52:50.04
Suddenly he broke it off and said, what did you say you were?

1771
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:52.96
Meaning what did you say you did in the Marine Corps?

1772
01:52:52.96 --> 01:52:58.88
A scout I said, Bradley, I used to be a machine gunner.

1773
01:52:58.88 --> 01:53:04.40
And the doctor says back, but that's no place for a man of your caliber.

1774
01:53:04.40 --> 01:53:07.36
Now I was shocked.

1775
01:53:07.36 --> 01:53:15.80
The old Shibaleth intelligence had not our government been culpable enough in pampering

1776
01:53:15.80 --> 01:53:22.92
the high IQ drafties as though they were too intelligent to fight for their country.

1777
01:53:22.92 --> 01:53:31.64
Could not doctor gentle see that I was proud to be a scout and before that a machine gunner

1778
01:53:31.64 --> 01:53:35.16
intelligence intelligence intelligence.

1779
01:53:35.16 --> 01:53:37.000
Keep it up America.

1780
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.04
Keep telling your youth that mud and danger are fit only for intellectual pigs.

1781
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:50.44
Keep on saying that only the stupid are fit to sacrifice that America must be defended

1782
01:53:50.44 --> 01:53:52.64
by the low brow.

1783
01:53:52.64 --> 01:54:01.12
Keep in mind that the high brow keep fawning head over heart and soon the head will arrive

1784
01:54:01.12 --> 01:54:08.16
at the complete folly of any kind of fight and meetly surrender the treasure to the first

1785
01:54:08.16 --> 01:54:15.16
bandit with enough heart to demand it.

1786
01:54:15.16 --> 01:54:19.000
Be careful.

1787
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.52
I think that we do a really good job now in America.

1788
01:54:25.52 --> 01:54:31.52
You get kids that are, you know, there will be enlisted kids with bachelor's degrees

1789
01:54:31.52 --> 01:54:37.52
and master's degrees in the army and the Marine Corps and the Seal teams.

1790
01:54:37.52 --> 01:54:41.48
I don't think we have that as much, but it's definitely something that you need to

1791
01:54:41.48 --> 01:54:42.48
watch out for.

1792
01:54:42.48 --> 01:54:46.28
I think especially this goes back to judgment.

1793
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:48.56
I posted that earlier today.

1794
01:54:48.56 --> 01:54:54.60
I met some young Marine, not a young Marine, but you know, guys probably 25, 27 years old

1795
01:54:54.60 --> 01:54:58.04
and he came into the gym and you know, some say, I use in the Marine Corps.

1796
01:54:58.04 --> 01:54:59.60
That's awesome man.

1797
01:54:59.60 --> 01:55:00.60
What's doing the Marine Corps?

1798
01:55:00.60 --> 01:55:03.04
He was like, I was a machine gunner.

1799
01:55:03.04 --> 01:55:07.52
Like yes, like yes, that's awesome.

1800
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:12.92
But to have somebody think, oh, you were just a machine gunner, you must know.

1801
01:55:12.92 --> 01:55:25.48
Be the machine gunner should be a faunted and elevated position in the world.

1802
01:55:25.48 --> 01:55:30.16
Bless the machine gunner is not there.

1803
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:32.44
You want to talk about a person that can get stuff done.

1804
01:55:32.44 --> 01:55:34.16
Go talk to a machine gunner.

1805
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:36.36
They'll make some stuff happen.

1806
01:55:36.36 --> 01:55:39.68
They're carrying a big peg of gun around.

1807
01:55:39.68 --> 01:55:44.16
They're laying down fire under pressure, put him off.

1808
01:55:44.16 --> 01:55:46.92
I'll put the machine gunner up against one of these intellectuals.

1809
01:55:46.92 --> 01:55:49.32
Eddie, day the week, bring it.

1810
01:55:49.32 --> 01:55:51.28
But the machine gunner can be an intellectual.

1811
01:55:51.28 --> 01:55:52.88
Absolutely.

1812
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:53.88
Absolutely.

1813
01:55:53.88 --> 01:55:54.88
That's the point.

1814
01:55:54.88 --> 01:55:55.88
Yeah.

1815
01:55:55.88 --> 01:55:56.88
That's the point.

1816
01:55:56.88 --> 01:56:00.36
Just because someone chooses to do something that's hard doesn't mean that they're

1817
01:56:00.36 --> 01:56:01.36
not smart.

1818
01:56:01.36 --> 01:56:02.36
Right.

1819
01:56:02.36 --> 01:56:09.64
In fact, I go so as far as to say they are searching for.

1820
01:56:09.64 --> 01:56:19.04
And discovering and becoming something that takes a level of mind power to do.

1821
01:56:19.04 --> 01:56:20.04
Yeah.

1822
01:56:20.04 --> 01:56:27.04
Kind of like that the week superficial assumption is that, oh, you're going to choose that

1823
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:28.52
kind of that hard thing.

1824
01:56:28.52 --> 01:56:32.40
Because it's not really intuitive to just, I'm going to go for the hardest thing.

1825
01:56:32.40 --> 01:56:37.72
It's intuitive to be like, I want to get this easy thing to do because it's easier.

1826
01:56:37.72 --> 01:56:42.16
So when someone chooses the hard thing to do, the kind of assumption is that, oh, you

1827
01:56:42.16 --> 01:56:43.16
had no other choice.

1828
01:56:43.16 --> 01:56:44.16
Oh, yeah.

1829
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:45.16
Yes.

1830
01:56:45.16 --> 01:56:46.16
Perfect.

1831
01:56:46.16 --> 01:56:47.16
But, yes.

1832
01:56:47.16 --> 01:56:48.16
No, man.

1833
01:56:48.16 --> 01:56:50.48
I think that's a guy in high school where he's a year old in us.

1834
01:56:50.48 --> 01:56:55.20
And he was like a smart guy and had all his stuff to get a good family and he went

1835
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:56.44
into the army.

1836
01:56:56.44 --> 01:57:00.88
And I remember some people were like kind of surprised because they're going to just

1837
01:57:00.88 --> 01:57:03.56
to the army that just like Dr. Gentle here.

1838
01:57:03.56 --> 01:57:05.36
Oh, what are you doing that for?

1839
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:06.96
Because I want to be a machine gunner.

1840
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:07.96
Yeah, that's why.

1841
01:57:07.96 --> 01:57:08.96
Yeah.

1842
01:57:08.96 --> 01:57:13.12
Props to the machine gunners.

1843
01:57:13.12 --> 01:57:16.24
Now out on the silent, he's there.

1844
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:24.36
He spends like a month and they're sitting down to watch a movie at the theater.

1845
01:57:24.36 --> 01:57:25.36
I'll play that.

1846
01:57:25.36 --> 01:57:30.40
Remember one time we had the awesome C-B's that worked for Winner Maudi with us.

1847
01:57:30.40 --> 01:57:33.08
And so they're building bunkers.

1848
01:57:33.08 --> 01:57:34.08
I'm not kidding.

1849
01:57:34.08 --> 01:57:37.80
What were their priority builds when they were in the body with me on our little camp,

1850
01:57:37.80 --> 01:57:39.56
camp, Mark Lee?

1851
01:57:39.56 --> 01:57:47.48
The priorities that they were working on were bunkers were security walls on the river,

1852
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:48.48
getting barbed wire.

1853
01:57:48.48 --> 01:57:50.04
Those are the priorities they were working on.

1854
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:53.36
And my lead CB, my CB chief.

1855
01:57:53.36 --> 01:57:59.28
He had to go to our headquarters for a couple days to get money and get equipment and

1856
01:57:59.28 --> 01:58:00.28
whatever.

1857
01:58:00.28 --> 01:58:04.88
And when he came back, he was great dude.

1858
01:58:04.88 --> 01:58:07.28
His nickname was Biggie.

1859
01:58:07.28 --> 01:58:09.28
And he was big.

1860
01:58:09.28 --> 01:58:11.28
Another one of those things.

1861
01:58:11.28 --> 01:58:12.28
Yeah, yeah.

1862
01:58:12.28 --> 01:58:18.28
No, he would, he would, like his warm-up sets on bench, we're in three 15.

1863
01:58:18.28 --> 01:58:19.28
He was big.

1864
01:58:19.28 --> 01:58:20.28
Big strong.

1865
01:58:20.28 --> 01:58:21.28
Yeah.

1866
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:22.28
He was strong.

1867
01:58:22.28 --> 01:58:27.60
And he came back and, you know, he says, he says, hey sir, come back from Fouloujia.

1868
01:58:27.60 --> 01:58:29.20
And I was like, oh, everything cool out there.

1869
01:58:29.20 --> 01:58:30.20
He goes, let me tell you something.

1870
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:32.20
I was like, what's that, Biggie?

1871
01:58:32.20 --> 01:58:34.20
He says, you know what they're building out there?

1872
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:36.20
I said, no, I have no idea.

1873
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:37.20
I don't care what they're building out there.

1874
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:40.72
Because they're building the theater.

1875
01:58:40.72 --> 01:58:41.72
I said, what?

1876
01:58:41.72 --> 01:58:43.44
He said, they're building the theater.

1877
01:58:43.44 --> 01:58:45.60
I said, you mean a movie theater?

1878
01:58:45.60 --> 01:58:48.92
He goes, yes, off the theater.

1879
01:58:48.92 --> 01:58:51.08
And he was just beside himself.

1880
01:58:51.08 --> 01:58:56.000
Because here we were trying to build bunkers and security walls, they were building

1881
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
the theater.

1882
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
We didn't make it in like that.

1883
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
But those CVs man, they kept us, they kept everything wrong and wrong.

1884
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And props, once you were props to the machine gunners, props to the CVs.

1885
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Oh, for sure.

1886
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.16
So they're an a theater that had been built out here.

1887
01:59:14.16 --> 01:59:19.16
And the movie began, there was an interruption over a public-adjust system of voice announced

1888
01:59:19.16 --> 01:59:23.40
allied troops have just invaded northern France.

1889
01:59:23.40 --> 01:59:26.76
The second front has been opened.

1890
01:59:26.76 --> 01:59:31.84
The fears and shouts rose into the soft night to be followed by a buzz of excitement.

1891
01:59:31.84 --> 01:59:36.44
But then the film began, and silence was restored.

1892
01:59:36.44 --> 01:59:39.12
I arose and left the amphitheater.

1893
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:41.32
My heart throbbing and excitement.

1894
01:59:41.32 --> 01:59:44.52
It was difficult to comprehend this excitement.

1895
01:59:44.52 --> 01:59:47.56
It was a mix of thrill and pride.

1896
01:59:47.56 --> 01:59:50.76
But predominating was the heartbeat of anxiety.

1897
01:59:50.76 --> 01:59:56.96
For suddenly, it had been born in upon me that great events were happening.

1898
01:59:56.96 --> 02:00:00.20
That the war was now rushing downhill to victory.

1899
02:00:00.20 --> 02:00:07.16
And here I was, clad and pallid pajamas and robe lounging around the hospital.

1900
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:13.000
Yarning came upon me in a rush, and I wept herring along the dark road back to the hospital.

1901
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.40
I wanted to rejoin my comrades.

1902
02:00:17.40 --> 02:00:21.56
Where he goes into the doctor, gentle, goes into his office.

1903
02:00:21.56 --> 02:00:25.28
And basically they work it out.

1904
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:26.28
Back to the book.

1905
02:00:26.28 --> 02:00:28.24
There's not much we can do for this trouble of yours.

1906
02:00:28.24 --> 02:00:31.56
The hospital commander told me there's no carrying it out here.

1907
02:00:31.56 --> 02:00:36.68
What you need is a change of climate and a less nerve-racking assignment.

1908
02:00:36.68 --> 02:00:38.40
You're shipping me back to the state, sir.

1909
02:00:38.40 --> 02:00:42.20
I asked he smiled wainly, ordinarily yes.

1910
02:00:42.20 --> 02:00:46.80
Unfortunately, you Marines can't go home unless you're carried home.

1911
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:51.72
So we are sending you back to duty with the suggestion that you're commanding officer,

1912
02:00:51.72 --> 02:00:54.72
have the century wake you during the night.

1913
02:00:54.72 --> 02:01:01.16
I laughed and he laughed and Dr. Gentle laughed.

1914
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:03.32
Because they knew that's not something that's feasible.

1915
02:01:03.32 --> 02:01:06.16
What they're basically saying is you're going to go back and you're just going to piss yourself

1916
02:01:06.16 --> 02:01:07.88
and you're going to fight.

1917
02:01:07.88 --> 02:01:10.96
And that's exactly what he wanted.

1918
02:01:10.96 --> 02:01:18.44
Let's back there and now back to the book we left Pavu Vu.

1919
02:01:18.44 --> 02:01:23.52
Victor's of Guadalcanal, new Britain, we went out to fight again marching into the open

1920
02:01:23.52 --> 02:01:27.28
John landing craft, driven up on the beach.

1921
02:01:27.28 --> 02:01:36.48
Never before where we so confident of victory never again would its price be so high.

1922
02:01:36.48 --> 02:01:41.60
Galileo was already a Holocaust.

1923
02:01:41.60 --> 02:01:49.84
The island flat and almost featureless was an altar being prepared for the emulation of

1924
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:51.68
17,000 men.

1925
02:01:51.68 --> 02:01:58.12
So they're going on to Pella Lu.

1926
02:01:58.12 --> 02:02:00.32
And here we go right into it.

1927
02:02:00.32 --> 02:02:01.32
They're in their landing craft.

1928
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:05.32
The water began to erupt in little geysers and the air became populated with exploding

1929
02:02:05.32 --> 02:02:06.32
steel.

1930
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:07.68
And me was saluting us.

1931
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:10.52
They were receiving us with mortar and artillery fire.

1932
02:02:10.52 --> 02:02:13.72
10,000 Japanese awaited on the island of Pella Lu.

1933
02:02:13.72 --> 02:02:17.000
10,000 men is brave and determined and skillful.

1934
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.44
As ever a garrison was since the art of warfare began.

1935
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:22.44
Skillful.

1936
02:02:22.44 --> 02:02:30.60
Yes, it was a terrible rain and it did terrible work among us before we reached the beach.

1937
02:02:30.60 --> 02:02:33.72
Our amtrak was among the first assault waves.

1938
02:02:33.72 --> 02:02:40.16
The beach was already a litter of burning blackened and phyby and trackers of dead and wounded.

1939
02:02:40.16 --> 02:02:44.76
A morda garden of exploding mortar shells.

1940
02:02:44.76 --> 02:02:51.16
Holes had beer scooped in the white sand or had been blasted out by the shells.

1941
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:57.56
The beach was poked with holes all filled with green clad, helmeted marines.

1942
02:02:57.56 --> 02:02:59.04
We were pinned down.

1943
02:02:59.04 --> 02:03:01.76
We were pinned down but not by mortars alone.

1944
02:03:01.76 --> 02:03:06.12
The machine gun fire came from an invincible outpost which the Japanese had blasted out

1945
02:03:06.12 --> 02:03:09.52
of a coral jutting into the bay.

1946
02:03:09.52 --> 02:03:14.08
We found an opening in it and even then we were filling it with all manners of small

1947
02:03:14.08 --> 02:03:15.48
armed fire grenades.

1948
02:03:15.48 --> 02:03:20.96
Sticks of dynamite hurled by men who had crept up to it or billowing fire from the flame

1949
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:31.76
floors who had also gained the hole but the answering fire continued to break are deadly

1950
02:03:31.76 --> 02:03:34.32
picnic ground.

1951
02:03:34.32 --> 02:03:40.84
And the reason for that is here for the Japanese had possessed a pebble for two decades

1952
02:03:40.84 --> 02:03:47.56
and had blasted into the coral a network of mutually supporting caves so that so these

1953
02:03:47.56 --> 02:03:53.08
they'd been there for twenty years preparing for this and so they've got this massive cave

1954
02:03:53.08 --> 02:03:57.44
network and even to every time they hit one of these locations.

1955
02:03:57.44 --> 02:04:03.44
The more guys were just pop up and they also the Japanese also had tanks on Pelaloo

1956
02:04:03.44 --> 02:04:04.44
back to the book.

1957
02:04:04.44 --> 02:04:07.16
Their tanks swooped in suddenly upon us.

1958
02:04:07.16 --> 02:04:10.80
They came tearing across the airfield a dozen or so of them.

1959
02:04:10.80 --> 02:04:11.80
It was startling.

1960
02:04:11.80 --> 02:04:16.52
They'd come out of nowhere and here were only riflemen and machine gunners to oppose

1961
02:04:16.52 --> 02:04:17.52
them.

1962
02:04:17.52 --> 02:04:19.72
It was a violent outburst of gunfire.

1963
02:04:19.72 --> 02:04:24.56
I poked my head above the crater through the lacy branch work of the scrub trees.

1964
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:30.44
I saw an enemy tank streaking along with snipers and camouflage hanging onto the rear.

1965
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:36.84
It was but a moment's glance but at the time my eye caught sight of a marine from F company

1966
02:04:36.84 --> 02:04:42.88
a veteran running bowl leg into the rear his face writhing shouting tanks tanks and officer

1967
02:04:42.88 --> 02:04:48.32
grabbed him and spun him around and kicked him and propelled him back to his post.

1968
02:04:48.32 --> 02:04:54.76
In the crater we'd prepared for defense like a caravan attacked by Indians.

1969
02:04:54.76 --> 02:04:59.72
The enemy tanks whist past their little wheels whirling within the tracks.

1970
02:04:59.72 --> 02:05:05.68
Machine guns clattered bazookas whambed our airplanes came screeching down from heaven and

1971
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:11.24
they rose the detonation of their bombs and the roar of exploding tanks.

1972
02:05:11.24 --> 02:05:16.64
To my right I saw a line of our tanks advancing firing as they came seem to stop each

1973
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:19.08
time their guns stuttered.

1974
02:05:19.08 --> 02:05:26.12
Then it was over the jab tanks had been destroyed.

1975
02:05:26.12 --> 02:05:33.16
I turned to go and as I did nearly stepped on someone's hand.

1976
02:05:33.16 --> 02:05:40.04
Excuse me I began to say but then I saw that it was an unattached hand or rather a detached

1977
02:05:40.04 --> 02:05:48.12
one it lay there alone open palm upwards clean capable solitary.

1978
02:05:48.12 --> 02:05:53.64
I could not tear my eyes from it the hand is the artisan of the soul.

1979
02:05:53.64 --> 02:06:00.76
It is the second member of the human trinity of head and hand and heart.

1980
02:06:00.76 --> 02:06:04.76
Man has no faculty more human than his hand.

1981
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:13.40
More beautiful, more expressive, nor productive to see this hand lying alone as though contempt

1982
02:06:13.40 --> 02:06:21.80
usually cast aside no longer a part of man no longer his help was to see war in all its

1983
02:06:21.80 --> 02:06:23.96
wantiness.

1984
02:06:23.96 --> 02:06:31.44
It was to see the especially brutal savagery of our own technique of rending.

1985
02:06:31.44 --> 02:06:38.56
And it was to see men at their eternal worst turning upon one another tearing one another

1986
02:06:38.56 --> 02:06:47.68
clawing at their own innards with the maniacal fury of the pride possessed.

1987
02:06:47.68 --> 02:06:52.36
Not much I can comment on that one.

1988
02:06:52.36 --> 02:06:56.56
Back to the book our casualties were extremely heavy.

1989
02:06:56.56 --> 02:07:02.48
More the day was done they were total 500 in the first regiment something like 20% this on the

1990
02:07:02.48 --> 02:07:05.000
first day.

1991
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.76
We were advancing again our objective with bloody nose ridge.

1992
02:07:09.76 --> 02:07:17.12
This was the high ground visible from across the airfield it gave the enemy perfect observation.

1993
02:07:17.12 --> 02:07:22.96
Advancing across the flat table of crushed coral on which there was hardly a single

1994
02:07:22.96 --> 02:07:29.56
depression as we were easily cited as clay ducks in a shooting gallery.

1995
02:07:29.56 --> 02:07:33.72
But there was no other route and we had to take it.

1996
02:07:33.72 --> 02:07:38.76
Grass cutting machine gun fire swept the airfield mortars mortarshells fell with the

1997
02:07:38.76 --> 02:07:42.64
com regularity of automation.

1998
02:07:42.64 --> 02:07:44.48
Marines fell.

1999
02:07:44.48 --> 02:07:45.80
They crumpled.

2000
02:07:45.80 --> 02:07:47.16
They staggered.

2001
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:48.52
They pitched forward.

2002
02:07:48.52 --> 02:07:53.80
They sank to their knees.

2003
02:07:53.80 --> 02:07:55.12
They fell backwards.

2004
02:07:55.12 --> 02:08:04.84
They kept advancing.

2005
02:08:04.84 --> 02:08:08.16
The mortars had stopped.

2006
02:08:08.16 --> 02:08:13.64
The first F company wave was advancing across the air strip running low with ranks scattered,

2007
02:08:13.64 --> 02:08:19.52
resting a withering machine gun fire that had been going to break the runway.

2008
02:08:19.52 --> 02:08:20.68
They were falling.

2009
02:08:20.68 --> 02:08:22.68
It seemed unreal.

2010
02:08:22.68 --> 02:08:28.96
It seemed a tabloat like a scene from a motion picture.

2011
02:08:28.96 --> 02:08:34.10
It required an effort of mine to recall that these were flesh and blood Marines men who

2012
02:08:34.10 --> 02:08:39.08
my new, whose lives were linked with mine.

2013
02:08:39.08 --> 02:08:47.36
The bill mort was required in facing up to the fact that my turn was next.

2014
02:08:47.36 --> 02:08:52.36
Here is the point in battle where one needs the rallying cry.

2015
02:08:52.36 --> 02:08:56.42
Here where the banner must be unfurled or the song song where the name of the cause

2016
02:08:56.42 --> 02:08:58.76
flung at the enemy like a challenge.

2017
02:08:58.76 --> 02:09:01.40
Here is the mounted charge.

2018
02:09:01.40 --> 02:09:07.24
The thing is old as warfare itself that either overwhelms the defense and wins the battle

2019
02:09:07.24 --> 02:09:11.88
or is broken and brings on defeat.

2020
02:09:11.88 --> 02:09:16.88
How much less for bidding might have been that avenue of death that I was about to cross

2021
02:09:16.88 --> 02:09:25.76
had there been some holy irrational shout like Viva Lampur or the Marine Corps forever

2022
02:09:25.76 --> 02:09:36.000
rather than that educated voice which in a saying Freud that was at all odds with the event

2023
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.32
said well it's art or now.

2024
02:09:42.32 --> 02:09:44.12
So you're going to get.

2025
02:09:44.12 --> 02:09:45.12
That's all you're going to get.

2026
02:09:45.12 --> 02:09:49.76
These Marines are getting teleport by machine gun fire by morgur.

2027
02:09:49.76 --> 02:09:51.60
They're getting teleport Marines are falling left and right.

2028
02:09:51.60 --> 02:09:55.64
They're continuing to advance.

2029
02:09:55.64 --> 02:10:01.26
They're continuing to advance and he's watching this group go across this airfield getting

2030
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:12.54
mode down he wants some kind of motivation and what does he get?

2031
02:10:12.54 --> 02:10:15.86
Well it's our turn now.

2032
02:10:15.86 --> 02:10:17.18
Crazy.

2033
02:10:17.18 --> 02:10:19.74
I bade goodbye to the artist.

2034
02:10:19.74 --> 02:10:22.42
He looked at me sadly from beneath his helmet.

2035
02:10:22.42 --> 02:10:26.26
His face made darker and more angular by its shadow.

2036
02:10:26.26 --> 02:10:31.66
He cast a roof or a glance in the direction of the air strip and the still falling

2037
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:33.66
men.

2038
02:10:33.66 --> 02:10:35.10
Good luck kid.

2039
02:10:35.10 --> 02:10:38.34
He said and turned away.

2040
02:10:38.34 --> 02:10:40.34
I began to run.

2041
02:10:40.34 --> 02:10:42.14
The heat rose and stifling waves.

2042
02:10:42.14 --> 02:10:45.26
The bullet whispered at times at other times they were not audible.

2043
02:10:45.26 --> 02:10:50.90
I ran with my head low my helmet bumping crazily to obscure my view like waves rising

2044
02:10:50.90 --> 02:10:54.14
around a small ship.

2045
02:10:54.14 --> 02:11:00.06
In a moment I could not see Lieutenant Deep Chest or filthy Fred.

2046
02:11:00.06 --> 02:11:01.86
I was alone in running.

2047
02:11:01.86 --> 02:11:05.10
There were men to my left still falling.

2048
02:11:05.10 --> 02:11:10.86
I ran and threw myself down caught my breath rose again and ran again suddenly I ran

2049
02:11:10.86 --> 02:11:15.86
into a shell crater full of men and I stopped running.

2050
02:11:15.86 --> 02:11:21.14
So the only cover that they have is a shell crater and he dives into this shell crater and

2051
02:11:21.14 --> 02:11:25.62
there are 10 guys are so in there.

2052
02:11:25.62 --> 02:11:30.34
And one of them he's called this one guy walkie talkie back to the book walkie talkie

2053
02:11:30.34 --> 02:11:32.42
sat below me on the crater floor.

2054
02:11:32.42 --> 02:11:35.82
He hunched his shoulders toward me and asked me to twirl certain giles.

2055
02:11:35.82 --> 02:11:39.26
I did but he could not seem to get through.

2056
02:11:39.26 --> 02:11:41.06
That came the screech of a shell.

2057
02:11:41.06 --> 02:11:45.18
I braised my back for it even though I knew that the ones you hear are not the ones

2058
02:11:45.18 --> 02:11:48.06
to be feared.

2059
02:11:48.06 --> 02:11:56.86
That how fear the one that gets you, the one you do not hear.

2060
02:11:56.86 --> 02:11:59.42
Another voice was audible now.

2061
02:11:59.42 --> 02:12:05.30
The fifth Marines lieutenant who was wounded, who was in fact dying as I learned later

2062
02:12:05.30 --> 02:12:11.70
was speaking by walkie talkie to his regimental commander.

2063
02:12:11.70 --> 02:12:15.02
The glorious fifth Marines have gone through sir.

2064
02:12:15.02 --> 02:12:19.82
You were saying and have achieved the objective.

2065
02:12:19.82 --> 02:12:31.42
We are now in contact with the first regiment.

2066
02:12:31.42 --> 02:12:41.26
Now there's 10 guys in there and finally one of the captains speaks up.

2067
02:12:41.26 --> 02:12:44.98
How many men here from the first Marines he asked?

2068
02:12:44.98 --> 02:12:46.98
We raised our hands.

2069
02:12:46.98 --> 02:12:49.38
Six A, that ought to be enough.

2070
02:12:49.38 --> 02:12:51.82
We better take that blockhouse over there.

2071
02:12:51.82 --> 02:12:54.02
That's where all the machine gun fire seems to be coming from.

2072
02:12:54.02 --> 02:12:58.90
As soon as this shell fire stops, we'll move out against it.

2073
02:12:58.90 --> 02:13:00.50
Just like that.

2074
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:04.14
The blockhouse had resisted even naval gunfire.

2075
02:13:04.14 --> 02:13:08.82
It had taken bombs, point blank, and remained standing.

2076
02:13:08.82 --> 02:13:12.22
It was obviously covered by a maze of pill boxes.

2077
02:13:12.22 --> 02:13:16.22
We six of us were to take it.

2078
02:13:16.22 --> 02:13:22.66
The captain might be stupid, but no one could say that he was not gallant.

2079
02:13:22.66 --> 02:13:29.50
I felt disgusted and resigned myself to an unprofitable death.

2080
02:13:29.50 --> 02:13:35.90
I looked at the men from the fifth who were regarding us with wonder and envy them for having

2081
02:13:35.90 --> 02:13:42.50
retained diplomatic relations with the state of sanity.

2082
02:13:42.50 --> 02:13:47.98
Their commander was hardly conscious now, but he had heard.

2083
02:13:47.98 --> 02:13:53.18
He waved a hand weekly in our direction and grinned as though to say, you'll never make

2084
02:13:53.18 --> 02:13:57.50
it, but there's no harm in trying.

2085
02:13:57.50 --> 02:14:03.46
And of course to a dying man, I suppose there was no harm.

2086
02:14:03.46 --> 02:14:10.30
So, do you think they're going to do it?

2087
02:14:10.30 --> 02:14:11.30
Yep, they're going to do it.

2088
02:14:11.30 --> 02:14:12.62
They're going to charge this blockhouse.

2089
02:14:12.62 --> 02:14:13.62
Six guys, this blockhouse.

2090
02:14:13.62 --> 02:14:17.70
There's just concrete blockhouse, massive machine gunfire coming from it.

2091
02:14:17.70 --> 02:14:19.34
They're going to charge this thing.

2092
02:14:19.34 --> 02:14:21.34
That took bombs, straight up.

2093
02:14:21.34 --> 02:14:25.78
That took direct hits from bombs.

2094
02:14:25.78 --> 02:14:27.34
They make a run for it.

2095
02:14:27.34 --> 02:14:28.34
Back to the book.

2096
02:14:28.34 --> 02:14:30.58
The shells drove us back to our crater.

2097
02:14:30.58 --> 02:14:33.58
Once again, walkie-talkie had difficulty with the apparatus.

2098
02:14:33.58 --> 02:14:37.18
He could receive, but not send, but Italian was asking for positions.

2099
02:14:37.18 --> 02:14:39.46
You better report back to command post.

2100
02:14:39.46 --> 02:14:42.90
Captain said to me, but come back out.

2101
02:14:42.90 --> 02:14:48.34
So lucky wants to go tell command post what's going on.

2102
02:14:48.34 --> 02:14:49.82
He, imagine.

2103
02:14:49.82 --> 02:14:51.26
There's just machine gunfire.

2104
02:14:51.26 --> 02:14:52.26
Mortar's going off everywhere.

2105
02:14:52.26 --> 02:14:53.70
He runs back.

2106
02:14:53.70 --> 02:14:56.46
He gets back to the major.

2107
02:14:56.46 --> 02:14:57.90
At the command post.

2108
02:14:57.90 --> 02:14:59.26
How is it out there, Lucky?

2109
02:14:59.26 --> 02:15:00.50
The major asked.

2110
02:15:00.50 --> 02:15:03.70
Bad sir, I said, adding nothing.

2111
02:15:03.70 --> 02:15:08.34
For my notion of this battle, we'll still confuse jumble of men and movement and explosions

2112
02:15:08.34 --> 02:15:13.78
in which blistering hot, when which a blistering hot airfield was somehow involved.

2113
02:15:13.78 --> 02:15:17.86
Then I rose and said, I better get back out.

2114
02:15:17.86 --> 02:15:19.70
The major nodded and waved.

2115
02:15:19.70 --> 02:15:20.14
Good luck.

2116
02:15:20.14 --> 02:15:28.82
I took firm hold of my Tommy gun and adjusted my pack secured my map case and circle the

2117
02:15:28.82 --> 02:15:32.66
pile of shell casings to return to the shell greater.

2118
02:15:32.66 --> 02:15:34.74
It was my last warlike act.

2119
02:15:34.74 --> 02:15:39.06
For the last time, I set my face toward the enemy.

2120
02:15:39.06 --> 02:15:42.06
About a hundred yards out, a shell exploded in front of me.

2121
02:15:42.06 --> 02:15:43.22
I veered to the right.

2122
02:15:43.22 --> 02:15:45.02
Another shell exploded in front of me.

2123
02:15:45.02 --> 02:15:46.02
I veered more.

2124
02:15:46.02 --> 02:15:47.02
Another shell.

2125
02:15:47.02 --> 02:15:48.54
Another, but closer.

2126
02:15:48.54 --> 02:15:49.54
Four more.

2127
02:15:49.54 --> 02:15:50.54
Another closer still.

2128
02:15:50.54 --> 02:15:52.10
I halted.

2129
02:15:52.10 --> 02:15:54.26
A horrifying fact became clear.

2130
02:15:54.26 --> 02:15:58.06
I had inserted myself between the enemy artillery and their target.

2131
02:15:58.06 --> 02:16:03.66
They were hunting something, perhaps the ammunition dumped behind me and were walking their

2132
02:16:03.66 --> 02:16:07.02
fire in its direction.

2133
02:16:07.02 --> 02:16:08.22
There was no cover.

2134
02:16:08.22 --> 02:16:09.94
To go forward was the die.

2135
02:16:09.94 --> 02:16:14.42
I could only run away from this approaching death, hoping to get out of the target area

2136
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:15.66
before it caught me.

2137
02:16:15.66 --> 02:16:18.46
I turned and ran.

2138
02:16:18.46 --> 02:16:22.86
I ran with the heat shimmering in waves of, from the coral, with the sweat oiling

2139
02:16:22.86 --> 02:16:27.74
my joints and the fear drying my mouth, with the shells exploding behind me, closer

2140
02:16:27.74 --> 02:16:33.22
ever closer, the airfield, the air filled with the angry voices of shrapnel demanding

2141
02:16:33.22 --> 02:16:35.74
my life.

2142
02:16:35.74 --> 02:16:40.98
I ran with an image in my mind of the Japanese gunner atop his ridge, bringing each

2143
02:16:40.98 --> 02:16:44.86
burst, carefully closer to my flying rear.

2144
02:16:44.86 --> 02:16:50.34
Chasing me across that baking table in a monstrous game of cat and mouse, gleeful at each

2145
02:16:50.34 --> 02:16:54.90
greater burst of speed called forth by a closer explosion.

2146
02:16:54.90 --> 02:17:00.18
And then tiring of sport lifting the gun and dropping one before me.

2147
02:17:00.18 --> 02:17:06.62
A shell landed alongside me, perhaps five feet away, but it did not explode or at least

2148
02:17:06.62 --> 02:17:11.22
I do not think it did, one cannot be certain at such time.

2149
02:17:11.22 --> 02:17:15.06
There is a different space in time with fear.

2150
02:17:15.06 --> 02:17:19.82
But there was a shell at two foot blob of burning red, which struck the coral with a thunder

2151
02:17:19.82 --> 02:17:25.06
flap and seemed to glance off into the air and go wailing away into the bay, with that

2152
02:17:25.06 --> 02:17:31.58
I called upon my remaining strength, and also then the Japanese gunner hit his target.

2153
02:17:31.58 --> 02:17:34.74
The ammunition dump was hit.

2154
02:17:34.74 --> 02:17:41.54
The war ended for me, I had been shattered, no good, a dry husk.

2155
02:17:41.54 --> 02:17:48.78
Modern war had had me, a giant lemon squeezer had crushed me dry, concussion, heat,

2156
02:17:48.78 --> 02:17:54.78
thirst, tension, all had had their way with me.

2157
02:17:54.78 --> 02:17:59.66
I must have stumbled about, unable to speak until at last I sank my knees beside two

2158
02:17:59.66 --> 02:18:02.70
men scratching a foxhole in the sand.

2159
02:18:02.70 --> 02:18:04.74
They were startled.

2160
02:18:04.74 --> 02:18:08.70
As no from afar I could hear them discussing me.

2161
02:18:08.70 --> 02:18:11.54
He can't think what he thinks the matter with him.

2162
02:18:11.54 --> 02:18:14.74
Search me, he don't look wounded, maybe he got a near miss.

2163
02:18:14.74 --> 02:18:16.42
Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?

2164
02:18:16.42 --> 02:18:18.74
Can't you say something?

2165
02:18:18.74 --> 02:18:22.58
What do you think we ought to do with him?

2166
02:18:22.58 --> 02:18:27.14
They rose and pulled me erect, got a shoulder a piece beneath my armpits and dragged me

2167
02:18:27.14 --> 02:18:29.66
like a dummy through the sand.

2168
02:18:29.66 --> 02:18:37.06
Like a life-sized doll in whom the spring had been broken, they dragged me to the doctor.

2169
02:18:37.06 --> 02:18:39.98
A corpsman laid me on the blanket, tied a ticket to me.

2170
02:18:39.98 --> 02:18:44.86
He thrust a needle into my arm, which was attached, a running hose to a bottle of liquid

2171
02:18:44.86 --> 02:18:49.18
suspended upside down on a fray on a wire frame.

2172
02:18:49.18 --> 02:18:52.78
The pair who had brought me, crouched beside me, what's wrong with him, Doc?

2173
02:18:52.78 --> 02:18:53.78
One of the masked.

2174
02:18:53.78 --> 02:18:55.78
I don't know the corpsman answered.

2175
02:18:55.78 --> 02:18:58.54
He's pretty beat up though, blast concussion.

2176
02:18:58.54 --> 02:19:01.98
I'm sending him back to the hospital ship.

2177
02:19:01.98 --> 02:19:05.06
One of the pair looked longingly at the Tommy gun beside me.

2178
02:19:05.06 --> 02:19:07.30
His glance seemed to say you won't need that anymore.

2179
02:19:07.30 --> 02:19:10.46
I told him with my eyes to take it.

2180
02:19:10.46 --> 02:19:13.90
And he slung it over his shoulder with immense satisfaction.

2181
02:19:13.90 --> 02:19:14.90
And they left.

2182
02:19:14.90 --> 02:19:17.66
They had their reward.

2183
02:19:17.66 --> 02:19:21.82
Mortars were falling as they carried me onto the beach with about a half a dozen other casualties.

2184
02:19:21.82 --> 02:19:27.50
We lay there and I wonder, dolly, if the jab gunners were to catch me after all.

2185
02:19:27.50 --> 02:19:32.82
At last, the landing boat took a subordinate reward off for the ship.

2186
02:19:32.82 --> 02:19:35.54
I began to feel shame.

2187
02:19:35.54 --> 02:19:41.62
The others were badly wounded, some put out of pain by morphine and hear I lay in a corner

2188
02:19:41.62 --> 02:19:50.02
quietly wretched like a frightened kitten intact my face on blemished my bones unbroken.

2189
02:19:50.02 --> 02:19:52.66
The war was ending.

2190
02:19:52.66 --> 02:19:55.10
I was ashamed.

2191
02:19:55.10 --> 02:20:01.54
My spirit crept away from the eyes staring, from the staring eyes that fast, fastened

2192
02:20:01.54 --> 02:20:05.90
upon us as the boat was drawn up out of the water to the deck.

2193
02:20:05.90 --> 02:20:10.42
People in white coats throng the rail and two of these at the center gazed with authority

2194
02:20:10.42 --> 02:20:15.26
into the boat searching for the wounded most in need of aid.

2195
02:20:15.26 --> 02:20:22.18
I shrank from that expert stare when suddenly one of them pointed at me and said, him, get

2196
02:20:22.18 --> 02:20:25.22
him downstairs right away.

2197
02:20:25.22 --> 02:20:29.98
They grasped me, stripping me naked as they did and hurried me down a ladder, laying

2198
02:20:29.98 --> 02:20:34.82
me on a table and again frusting a needle into my arm.

2199
02:20:34.82 --> 02:20:39.58
With the liquid flowing into my body came the warm flood of returning self-respect, the

2200
02:20:39.58 --> 02:20:46.26
dull, disperting shame had have disappeared the moment that pointing finger singled me out.

2201
02:20:46.26 --> 02:20:47.82
I had been hurt.

2202
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:50.06
I wasn't need of aid.

2203
02:20:50.06 --> 02:20:55.58
With a healing power of which he had no inkling, the doctor had restored my spirit to

2204
02:20:55.58 --> 02:20:58.74
me.

2205
02:20:58.74 --> 02:21:01.98
So the war ended for me.

2206
02:21:01.98 --> 02:21:06.94
Each day for a week I ascended the ladder to the deck and gazed in more bed fascination

2207
02:21:06.94 --> 02:21:10.46
that pellu and myel are so away.

2208
02:21:10.46 --> 02:21:12.42
They were still fighting.

2209
02:21:12.42 --> 02:21:16.94
One could hear the sound of the firing.

2210
02:21:16.94 --> 02:21:19.54
Each day the news was bad.

2211
02:21:19.54 --> 02:21:22.14
We were winning.

2212
02:21:22.14 --> 02:21:27.54
But at a fearful price.

2213
02:21:27.54 --> 02:21:31.46
And then the battle had been won.

2214
02:21:31.46 --> 02:21:37.06
The nation had come to the Japanese 10,000 on pellu and my regimen, the first was licking

2215
02:21:37.06 --> 02:21:40.38
its wound wounds on the beach.

2216
02:21:40.38 --> 02:21:48.98
Of my battalion, a force of some 1500 men, the remained but 28 affectives when the command

2217
02:21:48.98 --> 02:21:54.82
came for the last assault on that honeycomb of caves and pillboxes which the Japanese had

2218
02:21:54.82 --> 02:21:57.94
carved into bloody nose ridge.

2219
02:21:57.94 --> 02:22:07.34
In men and blood and agony, the most costly spit of land in the wide Pacific.

2220
02:22:07.34 --> 02:22:18.78
When the command came, they rose from their holes like shades from sepultures and advanced.

2221
02:22:18.78 --> 02:22:20.14
They could not run.

2222
02:22:20.14 --> 02:22:24.90
They could barely walk and they dragged their weapons.

2223
02:22:24.90 --> 02:22:31.38
They obeyed and they attacked.

2224
02:22:31.38 --> 02:22:40.34
They were taken from the line on the brink of collapse.

2225
02:22:40.34 --> 02:22:43.02
Ruffaford was killed.

2226
02:22:43.02 --> 02:22:49.82
He'd been hit by a mortar shell and blown a bit white man had been killed.

2227
02:22:49.82 --> 02:22:59.74
In the artist, the artist was dead, a brave man may he rest in peace.

2228
02:22:59.74 --> 02:23:06.82
Captain Dreadnaut fell dead of a sniper's bullet.

2229
02:23:06.82 --> 02:23:13.26
It had become a hall cost in the fullest sense.

2230
02:23:13.26 --> 02:23:19.06
Scores of others in the battalion sparrished.

2231
02:23:19.06 --> 02:23:24.06
Over those that have not been mentioned in this book, friends who did not fit the narrative,

2232
02:23:24.06 --> 02:23:31.74
men whose faces I have not forgotten and whose bravery and sacrifice has deposited a vast

2233
02:23:31.74 --> 02:23:37.62
spiritual credit for our nation to draw upon.

2234
02:23:37.62 --> 02:23:49.38
These two fell wrestling that island rock from the grasp of its most tenacious defender.

2235
02:23:49.38 --> 02:24:00.78
May they rest in peace.

2236
02:24:00.78 --> 02:24:09.02
Sacrifice says, not the blood of your brother, my friend.

2237
02:24:09.02 --> 02:24:14.14
Your blood.

2238
02:24:14.14 --> 02:24:18.10
That is why women weep when their men go off to war.

2239
02:24:18.10 --> 02:24:22.18
They do not weep for their victims.

2240
02:24:22.18 --> 02:24:28.22
They weep for them as victim.

2241
02:24:28.22 --> 02:24:39.46
That is why with the immemorial insight of mankind, there are gay songs and colorful bands

2242
02:24:39.46 --> 02:24:52.66
to send them off to fortify their failing hearts, not to quicken their lust for blood.

2243
02:24:52.66 --> 02:24:57.70
That is why there are no glorious living.

2244
02:24:57.70 --> 02:25:10.74
That only glorious dead heroes turn traitor warriors age and gross soft, but a victim

2245
02:25:10.74 --> 02:25:28.74
has changed less.

2246
02:25:28.74 --> 02:25:43.62
Sacrifice is eternal.

2247
02:25:43.62 --> 02:25:49.26
And I'll close with the book there.

2248
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:58.42
Obviously it's an incredible book about incredible men.

2249
02:25:58.42 --> 02:26:10.74
And their eternal sacrifice.

2250
02:26:10.74 --> 02:26:15.18
And it's so humbling to hear of their sacrifice.

2251
02:26:15.18 --> 02:26:18.74
And I say it over and over and over again.

2252
02:26:18.74 --> 02:26:23.78
And I will continue to say that we must live lives worthy of their sacrifice.

2253
02:26:23.78 --> 02:26:41.46
The 7D-100 killed at Guadalcanal, the 2,336 killed at Pelaloo.

2254
02:26:41.46 --> 02:26:50.74
And all the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who as Robert Lecky said later in his life

2255
02:26:50.74 --> 02:26:57.74
who fought or who foremost fighting.

2256
02:26:57.74 --> 02:27:05.14
Phil.

2257
02:27:05.14 --> 02:27:13.06
And I think it's also important to remember the example of Robert Lecky who by his own admission

2258
02:27:13.06 --> 02:27:17.18
was no angel.

2259
02:27:17.18 --> 02:27:27.74
So plaster saint, but who is truly a hero.

2260
02:27:27.74 --> 02:27:33.94
And remember that that people all people have good and bad qualities.

2261
02:27:33.94 --> 02:27:41.06
And people make mistakes and they do dumb things and get those very people are capable

2262
02:27:41.06 --> 02:27:48.06
of so much.

2263
02:27:48.06 --> 02:28:07.18
And yet so often we judge, we judge and we judge and we judge and we cast stones.

2264
02:28:07.18 --> 02:28:13.98
But who are we to judge?

2265
02:28:13.98 --> 02:28:19.50
Who are we to judge when a man like Robert Lecky?

2266
02:28:19.50 --> 02:28:23.22
Lecky Lecky.

2267
02:28:23.22 --> 02:28:31.02
Who not only drank to access and chase girls and pulled up pistol on his superior officer

2268
02:28:31.02 --> 02:28:35.78
and who got so nervous.

2269
02:28:35.78 --> 02:28:36.78
So scared.

2270
02:28:36.78 --> 02:28:43.42
Yes, I'm going to call it scared who got so scared that he would lose control of his

2271
02:28:43.42 --> 02:28:48.70
bladder every time he went to sleep.

2272
02:28:48.70 --> 02:28:56.38
And yet he overcame that fear with more bravery in his heart than most of us can even

2273
02:28:56.38 --> 02:29:06.70
fathom.

2274
02:29:06.70 --> 02:29:09.34
So who are we to judge?

2275
02:29:09.34 --> 02:29:16.26
We shouldn't judge people, we should help them.

2276
02:29:16.26 --> 02:29:26.34
Then there's probably nothing more we can do to live a worthwhile life than to help people.

2277
02:29:26.34 --> 02:29:37.58
To help other people and in helping other people I promise you will be rewarded and you

2278
02:29:37.58 --> 02:29:46.30
will be helping yourself too.

2279
02:29:46.30 --> 02:29:52.70
And one more thing that we see in this book once again is the strength of human will.

2280
02:29:52.70 --> 02:30:06.58
We see men tested beyond anything we can imagine.

2281
02:30:06.58 --> 02:30:17.30
And then when they pass that test one time they get given that test again and then again

2282
02:30:17.30 --> 02:30:22.66
and still they overcome.

2283
02:30:22.66 --> 02:30:31.94
Overcome the pain and the suffering and the fear.

2284
02:30:31.94 --> 02:30:34.50
And yet we can't get ourselves out of bed in the morning.

2285
02:30:34.50 --> 02:30:39.54
We can't move toward a goal we've set for ourselves.

2286
02:30:39.54 --> 02:30:48.42
Don't allow that.

2287
02:30:48.42 --> 02:30:56.46
Remember the tender who river remember the airfield at Guadalcanal remember the discipline

2288
02:30:56.46 --> 02:31:04.34
instilled in every marine at Paris Island.

2289
02:31:04.34 --> 02:31:17.42
And remember what you remember what you are capable of if you mobilize your will.

2290
02:31:17.42 --> 02:31:24.22
And if you keep moving forward you keep advancing.

2291
02:31:24.22 --> 02:31:33.58
Remember what you are capable of if you keep attacking and keeping attacking and keep attacking

2292
02:31:33.58 --> 02:31:41.54
and don't stop.

2293
02:31:41.54 --> 02:31:58.18
Don't stop moving forward and don't stop attacking and don't succumb to the suffering

2294
02:31:58.18 --> 02:32:03.58
and the pain and the fear don't succumb.

2295
02:32:03.58 --> 02:32:17.30
But instead move forward and attack.

2296
02:32:17.30 --> 02:32:25.50
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2297
02:32:25.50 --> 02:32:27.54
So echo Charles.

2298
02:32:27.54 --> 02:32:28.54
Yes.

2299
02:32:28.54 --> 02:32:33.78
I'm over here doing a little decompression.

2300
02:32:33.78 --> 02:32:42.46
Maybe you could mobilize your will to let people know how to support this podcast or

2301
02:32:42.46 --> 02:32:43.46
stuff.

2302
02:32:43.46 --> 02:32:47.26
I will make the disclaimer it doesn't take much will to do this.

2303
02:32:47.26 --> 02:32:51.26
But I do see it as a time to decompress a little bit.

2304
02:32:51.26 --> 02:32:53.26
Bro, seriously.

2305
02:32:53.26 --> 02:32:54.26
Yeah.

2306
02:32:54.26 --> 02:32:56.26
Can you even imagine?

2307
02:32:56.26 --> 02:32:58.82
Again, getting tested over and over again.

2308
02:32:58.82 --> 02:33:03.02
You're going through the hardest possible tests with dysentery and a hernia.

2309
02:33:03.02 --> 02:33:08.58
With dysentery, a hernia, you're pissing yourself, your friends are getting killed.

2310
02:33:08.58 --> 02:33:11.26
You pass that test through some miracle.

2311
02:33:11.26 --> 02:33:13.18
And then like, yeah, you got another test.

2312
02:33:13.18 --> 02:33:14.18
Right.

2313
02:33:14.18 --> 02:33:15.18
Yeah.

2314
02:33:15.18 --> 02:33:18.50
But to prepare you for the test we're going to make you suffer more.

2315
02:33:18.50 --> 02:33:20.98
And then you get tested again.

2316
02:33:20.98 --> 02:33:21.98
That's cool.

2317
02:33:21.98 --> 02:33:22.98
But does not doesn't matter.

2318
02:33:22.98 --> 02:33:23.98
It's not the final exam.

2319
02:33:23.98 --> 02:33:26.22
You're going to do it again.

2320
02:33:26.22 --> 02:33:28.38
And again, I say this all the time.

2321
02:33:28.38 --> 02:33:34.26
This is thousands and thousands and thousands of people did this.

2322
02:33:34.26 --> 02:33:37.94
That's what's important to remember.

2323
02:33:37.94 --> 02:33:39.70
This isn't this is a civilian.

2324
02:33:39.70 --> 02:33:40.94
This guy was a civilian.

2325
02:33:40.94 --> 02:33:41.94
Yeah.

2326
02:33:41.94 --> 02:33:43.10
It sounds like this crazy extreme.

2327
02:33:43.10 --> 02:33:44.10
No.

2328
02:33:44.10 --> 02:33:45.10
This is all the cases.

2329
02:33:45.10 --> 02:33:46.10
Yes.

2330
02:33:46.10 --> 02:33:47.74
This is all the cases.

2331
02:33:47.74 --> 02:33:48.74
This is all the cases.

2332
02:33:48.74 --> 02:33:51.54
He talks about he says, look, courage was common.

2333
02:33:51.54 --> 02:33:55.06
There was a rare case where we'd get touched by this fear and it would overtake guys

2334
02:33:55.06 --> 02:33:56.06
and we'd.

2335
02:33:56.06 --> 02:33:57.50
All storm back up the best we could.

2336
02:33:57.50 --> 02:33:59.94
But this isn't an anomaly.

2337
02:33:59.94 --> 02:34:03.06
This isn't the story of the singular hero.

2338
02:34:03.06 --> 02:34:04.22
Right.

2339
02:34:04.22 --> 02:34:07.10
This is the story of thousands and thousands of heroes.

2340
02:34:07.10 --> 02:34:09.46
And this is the story of what people are capable of.

2341
02:34:09.46 --> 02:34:11.10
People are capable of this.

2342
02:34:11.10 --> 02:34:12.74
It's proven.

2343
02:34:12.74 --> 02:34:17.42
And when you think you can't take any more guess what you can.

2344
02:34:17.42 --> 02:34:18.62
Amazing.

2345
02:34:18.62 --> 02:34:19.62
Amazing.

2346
02:34:19.62 --> 02:34:22.62
You know.

2347
02:34:22.62 --> 02:34:26.02
Well, if I got disinterested,

2348
02:34:26.02 --> 02:34:28.26
I wouldn't get out of bed straight up.

2349
02:34:28.26 --> 02:34:31.26
Don't let alone all this other stuff.

2350
02:34:31.26 --> 02:34:32.06
Yeah, I mean, bed.

2351
02:34:32.06 --> 02:34:33.86
Maybe I'd go to the hospital or something like that.

2352
02:34:33.86 --> 02:34:35.46
But then I'd go to hospital.

2353
02:34:35.46 --> 02:34:42.10
Even echo Charles could employ the will in carry on with this entry.

2354
02:34:42.10 --> 02:34:43.10
Yeah.

2355
02:34:43.10 --> 02:34:44.94
I even say you got malaria too, by the way.

2356
02:34:44.94 --> 02:34:47.38
You know, just think of my foot as a friend.

2357
02:34:47.38 --> 02:34:48.38
He got it too.

2358
02:34:48.38 --> 02:34:50.66
This friend got malaria, but he got malaria too.

2359
02:34:50.66 --> 02:34:51.66
Got it.

2360
02:34:51.66 --> 02:34:52.94
That's when they went to look at his hernia.

2361
02:34:52.94 --> 02:34:54.14
They're like, hey, you got to go back to front.

2362
02:34:54.14 --> 02:34:55.14
Oh, but you got malaria.

2363
02:34:55.14 --> 02:34:57.38
Just suffer through that for whatever it is.

2364
02:34:57.38 --> 02:34:58.38
Yeah.

2365
02:34:58.38 --> 02:34:59.38
And that's four days.

2366
02:34:59.38 --> 02:35:00.38
Okay, now you can go back.

2367
02:35:00.38 --> 02:35:01.38
Okay.

2368
02:35:01.38 --> 02:35:02.38
Okay, you're good now.

2369
02:35:02.38 --> 02:35:03.38
Okay.

2370
02:35:03.38 --> 02:35:05.18
Guys, you're just unbelievable.

2371
02:35:05.18 --> 02:35:06.18
I'm trying.

2372
02:35:06.18 --> 02:35:07.18
All right.

2373
02:35:07.18 --> 02:35:10.86
Well, I feel like we should talk about on it then.

2374
02:35:10.86 --> 02:35:14.18
No, that sounds like a great thing to talk about.

2375
02:35:14.18 --> 02:35:15.18
I'll let you talk about it.

2376
02:35:15.18 --> 02:35:17.22
I'm going to sit over here and decompress.

2377
02:35:17.22 --> 02:35:19.22
Well, okay.

2378
02:35:19.22 --> 02:35:23.82
So I'm really glad I'm just kind of goes without saying, but I'm going to say it.

2379
02:35:23.82 --> 02:35:27.18
So I'm glad that we kind of got aligned.

2380
02:35:27.18 --> 02:35:31.54
Well, I mean, I already took shrimp tech before this, but actually, I get technically

2381
02:35:31.54 --> 02:35:34.86
it was you who really made me take krill oil.

2382
02:35:34.86 --> 02:35:36.58
I didn't make you.

2383
02:35:36.58 --> 02:35:41.58
Yeah, but you let's say you influenced me enough to actually take action.

2384
02:35:41.58 --> 02:35:49.18
As they said, but anyway, so it's like kind of I compare like the post krill oil and

2385
02:35:49.18 --> 02:35:52.54
the pre-cruel oil situation.

2386
02:35:52.54 --> 02:35:55.30
So I was, you know, I was into lifting weights and stuff.

2387
02:35:55.30 --> 02:36:00.78
And you know how like weights is a good kind of weights is cool because you know how strong

2388
02:36:00.78 --> 02:36:01.78
you are kind of thing.

2389
02:36:01.78 --> 02:36:02.78
You know, there's a lot of it.

2390
02:36:02.78 --> 02:36:04.26
Yeah, it's pretty black and white.

2391
02:36:04.26 --> 02:36:05.26
There's the number.

2392
02:36:05.26 --> 02:36:09.18
So you can kind of judge like, yeah, this guy's strong or I'm stronger.

2393
02:36:09.18 --> 02:36:10.18
I'm not strong or whatever.

2394
02:36:10.18 --> 02:36:11.18
Right?

2395
02:36:11.18 --> 02:36:13.54
So I considered myself pretty strong in the weight room.

2396
02:36:13.54 --> 02:36:18.14
But, okay, this one time one of our friends came into town, we have, you know, we have

2397
02:36:18.14 --> 02:36:20.62
the weights at the outside and stuff.

2398
02:36:20.62 --> 02:36:23.62
And they're like, oh yeah, you got the weights.

2399
02:36:23.62 --> 02:36:28.78
So he gets under there and he grabs away not heavy, but he grabs them and I'm thinking

2400
02:36:28.78 --> 02:36:31.82
in my head, like, I can do way more than that.

2401
02:36:31.82 --> 02:36:35.62
But then I was like, I can, but I have to warm up a lot first.

2402
02:36:35.62 --> 02:36:37.66
You know, because it's really how strong am I?

2403
02:36:37.66 --> 02:36:38.66
You know, really?

2404
02:36:38.66 --> 02:36:44.06
Anyway, the point there is that was pre-cruel oil.

2405
02:36:44.06 --> 02:36:46.62
I'm not saying I could jump underneath my max.

2406
02:36:46.62 --> 02:36:48.02
No, I'm not saying that.

2407
02:36:48.02 --> 02:36:55.02
I'm saying like my actual strength is closer to my no, non-warm-up strength.

2408
02:36:55.02 --> 02:36:56.02
No.

2409
02:36:56.02 --> 02:36:57.02
That's a good thing.

2410
02:36:57.02 --> 02:36:59.02
You ever seen those videos?

2411
02:36:59.02 --> 02:37:00.02
Where?

2412
02:37:00.02 --> 02:37:01.02
Probably not.

2413
02:37:01.02 --> 02:37:02.02
But go ahead.

2414
02:37:02.02 --> 02:37:03.02
I don't know.

2415
02:37:03.02 --> 02:37:09.02
You remember when they dress up the young professional basketball player or something?

2416
02:37:09.02 --> 02:37:11.02
Oh, it's like under.

2417
02:37:11.02 --> 02:37:12.02
And there's no an old man.

2418
02:37:12.02 --> 02:37:13.02
Oh, yeah.

2419
02:37:13.02 --> 02:37:14.02
Yeah.

2420
02:37:14.02 --> 02:37:15.02
So there's this one.

2421
02:37:15.02 --> 02:37:19.02
I think he's like a pro-crossfit guy or a pro-weight little Olympic lifter or something.

2422
02:37:19.02 --> 02:37:22.02
So he goes to his beaches this whole man.

2423
02:37:22.02 --> 02:37:24.02
And he says, hey, you guys are strong and stuff like that.

2424
02:37:24.02 --> 02:37:27.02
I think he kind of overduzz it in my opinion with acting, but whatever.

2425
02:37:27.02 --> 02:37:31.02
And everyone's believing like, oh, this old man, you know, he probably used to be a weight lifter.

2426
02:37:31.02 --> 02:37:35.02
And he, and he gets under the weight and he's just killing.

2427
02:37:35.02 --> 02:37:36.02
He's in Barry.

2428
02:37:36.02 --> 02:37:38.02
He's just showing up all the guys.

2429
02:37:38.02 --> 02:37:39.02
Beating them.

2430
02:37:39.02 --> 02:37:40.02
You know, lifting them always.

2431
02:37:40.02 --> 02:37:41.02
Then them and whatnot.

2432
02:37:41.02 --> 02:37:44.02
So then he kind of like does his old man walk away.

2433
02:37:44.02 --> 02:37:48.02
That's how I felt before the cruel oil.

2434
02:37:48.02 --> 02:37:57.02
When it's time to lift like I could lift a lot, but like every day life on my kind of stiff, you know, like, I got to like get up after all, you know.

2435
02:37:57.02 --> 02:37:58.02
That's it.

2436
02:37:58.02 --> 02:38:02.02
That's the cruel, cruel oil comparison speech.

2437
02:38:02.02 --> 02:38:05.02
And where would you recommend people get the cruel oil that you speak of so highly?

2438
02:38:05.02 --> 02:38:07.02
Anyway, on it.

2439
02:38:07.02 --> 02:38:10.02
But he, and I looked into that.

2440
02:38:10.02 --> 02:38:14.02
And I'm like, all my prompts lead towards closure.

2441
02:38:14.02 --> 02:38:15.02
Yeah, my goal.

2442
02:38:15.02 --> 02:38:16.02
Yeah, sure.

2443
02:38:16.02 --> 02:38:20.02
No, but I'm saying like, you know, you know, you don't care about my goal.

2444
02:38:20.02 --> 02:38:21.02
You get your own goal.

2445
02:38:21.02 --> 02:38:22.02
Yes, stories to tell.

2446
02:38:22.02 --> 02:38:24.02
Yeah, thanks people want to hear about.

2447
02:38:24.02 --> 02:38:29.02
But I think when I saw those videos, I was like, that was me before a crew.

2448
02:38:29.02 --> 02:38:31.02
Or I really thought that like, well, that's how it feels.

2449
02:38:31.02 --> 02:38:34.02
You know, kind of find it's a funny video to funny thought even really.

2450
02:38:34.02 --> 02:38:35.02
But that's kind of how it feels.

2451
02:38:35.02 --> 02:38:37.02
But I have that problem meeting more.

2452
02:38:37.02 --> 02:38:38.02
You know, I don't feel like that anymore.

2453
02:38:38.02 --> 02:38:43.02
So if someone has seen that video and they might be feeling that that way,

2454
02:38:43.02 --> 02:38:44.02
maybe I can solve it.

2455
02:38:44.02 --> 02:38:46.02
I wish I knew that long time ago.

2456
02:38:46.02 --> 02:38:49.02
Anyway, looked into strong bone.

2457
02:38:49.02 --> 02:38:52.02
Remember we were talking about it last week or whatever.

2458
02:38:52.02 --> 02:38:54.02
And I was like, hey, does it make your bones?

2459
02:38:54.02 --> 02:38:55.02
I gave you a strong moment.

2460
02:38:55.02 --> 02:38:56.02
We had kind of did it.

2461
02:38:56.02 --> 02:38:58.02
I mean, like, when I'm there on it, very resourceful.

2462
02:38:58.02 --> 02:39:01.02
I'm a resourceful person on his very good resource.

2463
02:39:01.02 --> 02:39:03.02
The website.

2464
02:39:03.02 --> 02:39:06.02
And the answer is yes, it does.

2465
02:39:06.02 --> 02:39:10.02
It helps like even like the onset of like osteoporosis, like all this stuff.

2466
02:39:10.02 --> 02:39:12.02
It's like that's that's what it's like.

2467
02:39:12.02 --> 02:39:16.02
I didn't memorize all the terms, but I know the point, but it's,

2468
02:39:16.02 --> 02:39:19.02
oh, yeah, strong team.

2469
02:39:19.02 --> 02:39:21.02
I like the name it after.

2470
02:39:21.02 --> 02:39:23.02
Yes, because strong team calcium, all these things like make it.

2471
02:39:23.02 --> 02:39:26.02
So when you get older and you know, degeneration, you lose that.

2472
02:39:26.02 --> 02:39:30.02
Yeah, I'll in your natural deal, you know,

2473
02:39:30.02 --> 02:39:32.02
maybe and you get the strong bone.

2474
02:39:32.02 --> 02:39:36.02
Strong bone, strong to jump back in your bones easy money.

2475
02:39:36.02 --> 02:39:37.02
So you take the crew away.

2476
02:39:37.02 --> 02:39:39.02
Back in your bones or back in your joints.

2477
02:39:39.02 --> 02:39:43.02
Well, your joints are made up of your bones, tendons, ligaments.

2478
02:39:43.02 --> 02:39:45.02
Does it go into everything?

2479
02:39:45.02 --> 02:39:47.02
It goes into your bones.

2480
02:39:47.02 --> 02:39:48.02
Okay.

2481
02:39:48.02 --> 02:39:50.02
So you figure the tendon connection to your bone.

2482
02:39:50.02 --> 02:39:52.02
That's that's the part that's what you're trying to do up.

2483
02:39:52.02 --> 02:39:53.02
Yeah, that can jam me up.

2484
02:39:53.02 --> 02:39:55.02
That's what you heard right in your bicep.

2485
02:39:55.02 --> 02:39:57.02
Yeah, that's what I heard.

2486
02:39:57.02 --> 02:39:58.02
Yeah, I heard it one day.

2487
02:39:58.02 --> 02:40:01.02
It ripped off my bone, my bicep ripped off my bone.

2488
02:40:01.02 --> 02:40:04.02
Anyway, if I had some strong bone, that one happened.

2489
02:40:04.02 --> 02:40:05.02
Maybe it would have gone up.

2490
02:40:05.02 --> 02:40:08.02
But nonetheless, that is what strong bone helps.

2491
02:40:08.02 --> 02:40:10.02
So guess what I did got some.

2492
02:40:10.02 --> 02:40:13.02
No worries.

2493
02:40:13.02 --> 02:40:16.02
But yeah, there's not just that.

2494
02:40:16.02 --> 02:40:18.02
There's all kinds of cool stuff.

2495
02:40:18.02 --> 02:40:20.02
Warrior bars, that's not how I got more of those.

2496
02:40:20.02 --> 02:40:24.02
Shroom tech for performance and the program.

2497
02:40:24.02 --> 02:40:28.02
Here's the thing, I think sometimes people will kind of mistake the

2498
02:40:28.02 --> 02:40:31.02
Shroom tech when you know, because it helps your oxygen.

2499
02:40:31.02 --> 02:40:36.02
They think that like, I'm going to when I breathe, it has something to do with your breathing.

2500
02:40:36.02 --> 02:40:38.02
You know, it's not your breathing or your lungs.

2501
02:40:38.02 --> 02:40:42.02
It's the amount of oxygen you take up when you breathe.

2502
02:40:42.02 --> 02:40:44.02
So they can go to your muscle.

2503
02:40:44.02 --> 02:40:45.02
That's what it helps.

2504
02:40:45.02 --> 02:40:52.02
So if you go hard, like, super hard or grappling long way called wads.

2505
02:40:52.02 --> 02:40:53.02
Right?

2506
02:40:53.02 --> 02:40:54.02
Where's the day?

2507
02:40:54.02 --> 02:40:55.02
Yeah, yeah.

2508
02:40:55.02 --> 02:40:56.02
It helps.

2509
02:40:56.02 --> 02:40:57.02
Keep to the other red.

2510
02:40:57.02 --> 02:40:59.02
But yeah, go on there.

2511
02:40:59.02 --> 02:41:03.02
For whatever you do, you know, they even work out stuff and whatnot.

2512
02:41:03.02 --> 02:41:04.02
It's actually kind of a fun website.

2513
02:41:04.02 --> 02:41:07.02
You're beyond there for a while looking at the cool stuff.

2514
02:41:07.02 --> 02:41:08.02
That's my opinion.

2515
02:41:08.02 --> 02:41:10.02
And my experience.

2516
02:41:10.02 --> 02:41:13.02
You know, subscribe to the podcast.

2517
02:41:13.02 --> 02:41:16.02
Actually, you know what we'll talk about Amazon first.

2518
02:41:16.02 --> 02:41:17.02
So Amazon click through.

2519
02:41:17.02 --> 02:41:20.02
This is a good way to support podcasts.

2520
02:41:20.02 --> 02:41:21.02
What you do.

2521
02:41:21.02 --> 02:41:24.02
If you don't know already.

2522
02:41:24.02 --> 02:41:26.02
Before you do your Amazon shopping.

2523
02:41:26.02 --> 02:41:28.02
Go to jocopotcast.com.

2524
02:41:28.02 --> 02:41:35.02
Either on the tab on the top left and green or on the top menu.

2525
02:41:35.02 --> 02:41:39.02
Or on the side kind of towards the bottom.

2526
02:41:39.02 --> 02:41:40.02
This is a place to click on.

2527
02:41:40.02 --> 02:41:42.02
Just support through either support.

2528
02:41:42.02 --> 02:41:44.02
Jocopotcast or Amazon click through.

2529
02:41:44.02 --> 02:41:46.02
Anyway, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through there.

2530
02:41:46.02 --> 02:41:49.02
Then do your shopping.

2531
02:41:49.02 --> 02:41:51.02
I actually did that the other day.

2532
02:41:51.02 --> 02:41:54.02
And I don't know if you're watching this on YouTube.

2533
02:41:54.02 --> 02:41:57.02
But if you are, this is what I bought.

2534
02:41:57.02 --> 02:42:00.02
Google just took towing.

2535
02:42:00.02 --> 02:42:05.02
And also, also, if you totally missed this book.

2536
02:42:05.02 --> 02:42:07.02
I didn't, I don't know if I made it clear enough.

2537
02:42:07.02 --> 02:42:11.02
The book that we read today is called Hellment for my pillow.

2538
02:42:11.02 --> 02:42:13.02
By Robert Lecky.

2539
02:42:13.02 --> 02:42:15.02
You can get that Amazon.

2540
02:42:15.02 --> 02:42:16.02
You're going to put it echo.

2541
02:42:16.02 --> 02:42:17.02
We'll have it on the website.

2542
02:42:17.02 --> 02:42:18.02
And we'll click that.

2543
02:42:18.02 --> 02:42:19.02
And you buy it.

2544
02:42:19.02 --> 02:42:20.02
Boom.

2545
02:42:20.02 --> 02:42:21.02
You'll be good to go.

2546
02:42:21.02 --> 02:42:22.02
Yeah.

2547
02:42:22.02 --> 02:42:23.02
You will support the podcast.

2548
02:42:23.02 --> 02:42:24.02
And it's a family.

2549
02:42:24.02 --> 02:42:28.02
And some way, because there'll be somehow being supported.

2550
02:42:28.02 --> 02:42:29.02
Right?

2551
02:42:29.02 --> 02:42:30.02
Because they're owned.

2552
02:42:30.02 --> 02:42:31.02
I'm sure of this book.

2553
02:42:31.02 --> 02:42:35.02
So it's a good way to support this hero, this hero's family.

2554
02:42:35.02 --> 02:42:38.02
And also get the Pacific.

2555
02:42:38.02 --> 02:42:40.02
I don't know if we could put that.

2556
02:42:40.02 --> 02:42:41.02
I don't know.

2557
02:42:41.02 --> 02:42:42.02
But anyways, what?

2558
02:42:42.02 --> 02:42:44.02
Like if you could put it on.

2559
02:42:44.02 --> 02:42:45.02
Click through.

2560
02:42:45.02 --> 02:42:47.02
Unless maybe someone bought the DVDs.

2561
02:42:47.02 --> 02:42:49.02
But watch that.

2562
02:42:49.02 --> 02:42:50.02
And you know what?

2563
02:42:50.02 --> 02:42:51.02
When you watch it.

2564
02:42:51.02 --> 02:42:53.02
And you wrap yourself mentally.

2565
02:42:53.02 --> 02:42:54.02
And don't watch it.

2566
02:42:54.02 --> 02:42:55.02
While there's other things going on.

2567
02:42:55.02 --> 02:42:56.02
Sit down.

2568
02:42:56.02 --> 02:42:57.02
Right.

2569
02:42:57.02 --> 02:43:02.02
On a nice situation, you know, logistically with a good TV set.

2570
02:43:02.02 --> 02:43:04.02
And a good speaker system.

2571
02:43:04.02 --> 02:43:05.02
Throne.

2572
02:43:05.02 --> 02:43:06.02
Yeah.

2573
02:43:06.02 --> 02:43:07.02
And then watch the Pacific.

2574
02:43:07.02 --> 02:43:08.02
And you only.

2575
02:43:08.02 --> 02:43:11.02
Well, they're like, maybe you can watch two at a time.

2576
02:43:11.02 --> 02:43:12.02
Maybe.

2577
02:43:12.02 --> 02:43:13.02
What?

2578
02:43:13.02 --> 02:43:14.02
Two episodes.

2579
02:43:14.02 --> 02:43:15.02
But watch them close together too.

2580
02:43:15.02 --> 02:43:17.02
So you kind of maintain the continuity of the situation.

2581
02:43:17.02 --> 02:43:18.02
Right.

2582
02:43:18.02 --> 02:43:19.02
Because that's good too.

2583
02:43:19.02 --> 02:43:20.02
You see it.

2584
02:43:20.02 --> 02:43:22.02
Man, it's just incredibly well done.

2585
02:43:22.02 --> 02:43:23.02
The thing.

2586
02:43:23.02 --> 02:43:24.02
Yeah.

2587
02:43:24.02 --> 02:43:25.02
It's awesome.

2588
02:43:25.02 --> 02:43:28.02
And then when you have the background of the podcast of the books.

2589
02:43:28.02 --> 02:43:29.02
And you read the books, man.

2590
02:43:29.02 --> 02:43:30.02
It's really.

2591
02:43:30.02 --> 02:43:31.02
Yeah.

2592
02:43:31.02 --> 02:43:32.02
Totally powerful.

2593
02:43:32.02 --> 02:43:33.02
Like, come to me.

2594
02:43:33.02 --> 02:43:34.02
You actually get more into it.

2595
02:43:34.02 --> 02:43:35.02
Oh, for sure.

2596
02:43:35.02 --> 02:43:36.02
You know, like, when you know the guys on the story.

2597
02:43:36.02 --> 02:43:37.02
Yeah.

2598
02:43:37.02 --> 02:43:38.02
For sure.

2599
02:43:38.02 --> 02:43:39.02
You're more invested in the characters.

2600
02:43:39.02 --> 02:43:40.02
Yeah.

2601
02:43:40.02 --> 02:43:44.02
And you realize that when you see lucky lucky in the thing, you have his whole

2602
02:43:44.02 --> 02:43:45.02
backstory.

2603
02:43:45.02 --> 02:43:47.02
It was whole life when you've read the book.

2604
02:43:47.02 --> 02:43:48.02
And it's awesome.

2605
02:43:48.02 --> 02:43:53.02
You know, um, there's a, by the way, that is on the podcast website.

2606
02:43:53.02 --> 02:43:58.02
There's a whole section, whole page with all the books of all the podcast.

2607
02:43:58.02 --> 02:44:01.02
Make it easy for the book situation.

2608
02:44:01.02 --> 02:44:02.02
But yeah.

2609
02:44:02.02 --> 02:44:06.02
So yeah, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through this, the click through the Amazon

2610
02:44:06.02 --> 02:44:07.02
link.

2611
02:44:07.02 --> 02:44:08.02
And then do your shopping.

2612
02:44:08.02 --> 02:44:11.02
And yes, I did buy this item, which I'm showing.

2613
02:44:11.02 --> 02:44:14.02
So if you look on YouTube, you can see it.

2614
02:44:14.02 --> 02:44:16.02
It's to add to our little collection on the table.

2615
02:44:16.02 --> 02:44:19.02
Yeah.

2616
02:44:19.02 --> 02:44:22.02
So yeah, speaking of YouTube, we have a YouTube channel.

2617
02:44:22.02 --> 02:44:24.02
It's good.

2618
02:44:24.02 --> 02:44:29.02
People have been telling me.

2619
02:44:29.02 --> 02:44:33.02
For real, people have been telling me, not just one person, but they say, hey, you should take

2620
02:44:33.02 --> 02:44:37.02
because, okay, on YouTube channel, we have the podcast, of course, the video format.

2621
02:44:37.02 --> 02:44:40.02
Exerps, just like, you know, excerpts from the podcast.

2622
02:44:40.02 --> 02:44:43.02
So you can, like, share them and stuff like that.

2623
02:44:43.02 --> 02:44:47.02
And then there's like, well, what do you call them? What artistic pieces?

2624
02:44:47.02 --> 02:44:51.02
Stuff that I put some like time into, put some track of soundtrack.

2625
02:44:51.02 --> 02:44:53.02
Echo Charles videos.

2626
02:44:53.02 --> 02:44:54.02
Sure. I just called it.

2627
02:44:54.02 --> 02:44:56.02
I forget what I called it.

2628
02:44:56.02 --> 02:44:58.02
Like discipline, something.

2629
02:44:58.02 --> 02:44:59.02
I don't know.

2630
02:44:59.02 --> 02:45:02.02
So you made three categories or two to play.

2631
02:45:02.02 --> 02:45:07.02
So basically, people have been asked me, hey, you should separate them and make them into playlists.

2632
02:45:07.02 --> 02:45:11.02
Which kind of new about, but I'm not deep into the YouTube thing.

2633
02:45:11.02 --> 02:45:13.02
Well, we know that.

2634
02:45:13.02 --> 02:45:17.02
Well, no, as far as the customization and all that, which, which I kind of looked into.

2635
02:45:17.02 --> 02:45:18.02
So this is good.

2636
02:45:18.02 --> 02:45:18.02
What?

2637
02:45:18.02 --> 02:45:21.02
I like about this is people gave you a suggestion, which I saw too.

2638
02:45:21.02 --> 02:45:25.02
You, you looked at it, you explored it, and now you executed on it.

2639
02:45:25.02 --> 02:45:26.02
Yeah, totally did.

2640
02:45:26.02 --> 02:45:30.02
So if there's any other good ideas that people have, they should post them.

2641
02:45:30.02 --> 02:45:34.02
And so that way you can improve even more and we can improve and serve for them better.

2642
02:45:34.02 --> 02:45:39.02
Yeah, I think so. I think that's, and of course, someone going to be like, hey,

2643
02:45:39.02 --> 02:45:45.02
you know, and they'll say an idea, it might not be all that good, but if, or it may not seem like it's all that good.

2644
02:45:45.02 --> 02:45:50.02
But if another person says it, kind of unrelated, you know, not the kind of where some guys should say,

2645
02:45:50.02 --> 02:45:56.02
but do this, you know, make this or create this and then someone just likes it or puts a like on it.

2646
02:45:56.02 --> 02:45:57.02
Or says, yeah.

2647
02:45:57.02 --> 02:45:59.02
So you're asking for multiple.

2648
02:45:59.02 --> 02:46:03.02
Well, not the split hairs, but I'm not asking for anything.

2649
02:46:03.02 --> 02:46:05.02
Oh, I'm saying that's where the actor.

2650
02:46:05.02 --> 02:46:10.02
Yeah, so if someone says a suggestion, maybe the next day, two days, three days later,

2651
02:46:10.02 --> 02:46:13.02
another person says same suggestion, suggestion unrelated.

2652
02:46:13.02 --> 02:46:17.02
And that, ten, the end of the tendency, I see a tendency coming up.

2653
02:46:17.02 --> 02:46:19.02
Then that's when I'd start taking action.

2654
02:46:19.02 --> 02:46:23.02
What about the 14,000 people that told you to make more videos?

2655
02:46:23.02 --> 02:46:25.02
I think in more videos, yes, that's what I thought.

2656
02:46:25.02 --> 02:46:28.02
Yeah, those are, no, because I was watching, I realized I was watching so many,

2657
02:46:28.02 --> 02:46:35.02
I can't remember who was, but I was watching chunks of someone speak the other night, someone that I was, I don't know who was.

2658
02:46:35.02 --> 02:46:38.02
And I was so happy that they were in short clips.

2659
02:46:38.02 --> 02:46:40.02
I was like, this is why we need more short clips.

2660
02:46:40.02 --> 02:46:41.02
Yeah.

2661
02:46:41.02 --> 02:46:43.02
Because it's really convenient to go.

2662
02:46:43.02 --> 02:46:44.02
What's this idea here?

2663
02:46:44.02 --> 02:46:45.02
Boom.

2664
02:46:45.02 --> 02:46:46.02
Yeah.

2665
02:46:46.02 --> 02:46:46.02
You see the name of the video you go.

2666
02:46:46.02 --> 02:46:47.02
Here's the idea.

2667
02:46:47.02 --> 02:46:48.02
I want to think about that idea, boom.

2668
02:46:48.02 --> 02:46:49.02
Yeah.

2669
02:46:49.02 --> 02:46:49.02
You can go.

2670
02:46:49.02 --> 02:46:54.02
And YouTube is good like that where if there's a bunch of them, which, well, I think we're kind of coming up with,

2671
02:46:54.02 --> 02:46:55.02
or collections kind of growing now.

2672
02:46:55.02 --> 02:46:57.02
There's a bud, I'd say there's a bunch of them.

2673
02:46:57.02 --> 02:47:04.02
How well did you execute when people said make when people like episode 42 make a video from this to this?

2674
02:47:04.02 --> 02:47:05.02
How, how did you do any of that?

2675
02:47:05.02 --> 02:47:06.02
Or did you blow everyone off?

2676
02:47:06.02 --> 02:47:07.02
No, no, no.

2677
02:47:07.02 --> 02:47:09.02
Yeah, that's mainly what I've based it on.

2678
02:47:09.02 --> 02:47:10.02
Oh, okay.

2679
02:47:10.02 --> 02:47:14.02
So, but those are, they're everywhere, you know.

2680
02:47:14.02 --> 02:47:17.02
So some of them don't quite translate.

2681
02:47:17.02 --> 02:47:21.02
Some of them, I just, I mean, I don't want to upload like five in one day.

2682
02:47:21.02 --> 02:47:26.02
And I've read some stuff that it's like, no, no, it's not good to do that, but, no, no, that's all, that's all, that's all long story.

2683
02:47:26.02 --> 02:47:28.02
I bet I don't know.

2684
02:47:28.02 --> 02:47:31.02
Let's not just, let's not think about what's good to do and what's not good to do.

2685
02:47:31.02 --> 02:47:33.02
You just gotta get to see what you're trying to get.

2686
02:47:33.02 --> 02:47:36.02
So yeah, you're trying to, yeah, I dig it, man.

2687
02:47:36.02 --> 02:47:40.02
But yeah, YouTube's good like that where if you listen to just the, like, an excerpt,

2688
02:47:40.02 --> 02:47:42.02
we're just a clip two minute three minutes four minutes.

2689
02:47:42.02 --> 02:47:45.02
And you're like, dang, I want to, I want to listen to some more.

2690
02:47:45.02 --> 02:47:51.02
They, not only are they there to listen if you want, but they'll suggest, so you'll have a bit of continuity there.

2691
02:47:51.02 --> 02:47:54.02
Instead of like, oh, I'm locked into this three hour thing right now.

2692
02:47:54.02 --> 02:48:01.02
Right. Well, that's, and that's one thing that's a little bit tricky about this is that when I, when I'm thinking, when I'm talking,

2693
02:48:01.02 --> 02:48:04.02
I'm thinking in the context of this giant two hour thing.

2694
02:48:04.02 --> 02:48:09.02
So sometimes it's hard to snip out something and you lose a little bit in my opinion.

2695
02:48:09.02 --> 02:48:13.02
Yeah, but you also gain a lot because you can get it quick.

2696
02:48:13.02 --> 02:48:20.02
Right. And you can share it with the next guy who's more likely or the next person to more likely, listen to it.

2697
02:48:20.02 --> 02:48:27.02
Yeah. Because even now, man, people will send me, you know, whether it be funny videos, there's this sodium video that,

2698
02:48:27.02 --> 02:48:31.02
you know, the guy skipping a piece of sodium across the lake.

2699
02:48:31.02 --> 02:48:37.02
Yeah. You saw that, it's been going around. I don't know if people look for it and then send it to me or it's been going around.

2700
02:48:37.02 --> 02:48:43.02
So now more people are sending it to me because the last like two weeks, everyone's been sending it to me.

2701
02:48:43.02 --> 02:48:46.02
And I want to actually do that. I want to get the sodium metal.

2702
02:48:46.02 --> 02:48:48.02
And I want to throw it into the water.

2703
02:48:48.02 --> 02:48:56.02
Yeah, we're doing it at some point. Yeah. You're house. I do. If we can find it, I want to do it in film and then just see what I see what up.

2704
02:48:56.02 --> 02:49:00.02
I got to start looking to get some sodium metal.

2705
02:49:00.02 --> 02:49:10.02
But yeah, that's, you know, the, these are good things. These, these YouTube situation made the playlist there on there.

2706
02:49:10.02 --> 02:49:13.02
Exerps, I'm putting more on there.

2707
02:49:13.02 --> 02:49:15.02
There it is.

2708
02:49:15.02 --> 02:49:22.02
Subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher or Google Play and all the podcast platforms.

2709
02:49:22.02 --> 02:49:28.02
You know, that's a good way to support because you're essentially just kind of in the game in general.

2710
02:49:28.02 --> 02:49:31.02
You know, and that's really the thing.

2711
02:49:31.02 --> 02:49:40.02
Because like the more people, you know, they'll hit us on the pun Twitter or just like kind of knowing and knowing what year's talking about or submitting questions.

2712
02:49:40.02 --> 02:49:45.02
This kind of stuff. It does make that circle of like, it's not just juggle telling us what to do.

2713
02:49:45.02 --> 02:49:48.02
It's kind of like we're all in this group, you know.

2714
02:49:48.02 --> 02:49:54.02
Well, yeah, it's like hanging out with your friends basically.

2715
02:49:54.02 --> 02:50:02.02
Like when I go on the road now, like I was just out with some firefighters and like we're all, everyone's telling the same jokes.

2716
02:50:02.02 --> 02:50:05.02
But they're all, you know, we all get it.

2717
02:50:05.02 --> 02:50:06.02
Yeah, exactly.

2718
02:50:06.02 --> 02:50:11.02
So it's cool right now with them because it's like as if they were here. And I was actually talking to them about them.

2719
02:50:11.02 --> 02:50:15.02
Like, well, you know, when it first happened, it would be a little bit strange to me.

2720
02:50:15.02 --> 02:50:16.02
Right.

2721
02:50:16.02 --> 02:50:19.02
Because you don't remember them sitting there because no one was sitting there actually.

2722
02:50:19.02 --> 02:50:24.02
And I was like, well, sometimes it seemed like the podcast was like, was me and echo sitting in a room alone.

2723
02:50:24.02 --> 02:50:25.02
Right.

2724
02:50:25.02 --> 02:50:27.02
But then you realize, no, there's a lot of people sitting in here with us.

2725
02:50:27.02 --> 02:50:30.02
And they have their own spins.

2726
02:50:30.02 --> 02:50:35.02
This is what's funny is people have their own variations on the jokes and on the inside things.

2727
02:50:35.02 --> 02:50:40.02
And I'm like, well, we're talking about so it's all, and you know, they've already taken stuff and spun it out somewhere.

2728
02:50:40.02 --> 02:50:43.02
And now they're bringing it back to me. So I'm part of there.

2729
02:50:43.02 --> 02:50:44.02
Right.

2730
02:50:44.02 --> 02:50:47.02
I get in and get inside their game. So it's pretty funny.

2731
02:50:47.02 --> 02:50:47.02
Yeah.

2732
02:50:47.02 --> 02:50:50.02
And that's not to mention the questions that you answer.

2733
02:50:50.02 --> 02:50:52.02
It's all everyone's questions for sure.

2734
02:50:52.02 --> 02:50:52.02
Yeah, for sure.

2735
02:50:52.02 --> 02:50:56.02
That's not like you're like, let me think of this question that I think people have.

2736
02:50:56.02 --> 02:51:00.02
No, you got it from certain people and you know, answer them there.

2737
02:51:00.02 --> 02:51:01.02
Yeah.

2738
02:51:01.02 --> 02:51:04.02
You know, it's like a two, three way street.

2739
02:51:04.02 --> 02:51:06.02
You do something better.

2740
02:51:06.02 --> 02:51:11.02
Anyway, so yeah, when you're, when you're subscribed, you're, you know, you're kind of in the group.

2741
02:51:11.02 --> 02:51:13.02
Good way to support.

2742
02:51:13.02 --> 02:51:16.02
Also, jacquoise store called jacquoise store.

2743
02:51:16.02 --> 02:51:17.02
Good store.

2744
02:51:17.02 --> 02:51:21.02
Isn't more like the podcast has a store because I don't actually have a store.

2745
02:51:21.02 --> 02:51:24.02
It's the podcast has a store.

2746
02:51:24.02 --> 02:51:26.02
Yeah, yes, technically.

2747
02:51:26.02 --> 02:51:28.02
But you always make it sound like I have a store.

2748
02:51:28.02 --> 02:51:30.02
Yeah, because it's called jacquoise store.

2749
02:51:30.02 --> 02:51:31.02
We have a store.

2750
02:51:31.02 --> 02:51:32.02
Yeah.

2751
02:51:32.02 --> 02:51:35.02
It's not jacquoise store.

2752
02:51:35.02 --> 02:51:36.02
It's jacquoise store.

2753
02:51:36.02 --> 02:51:37.02
Okay.

2754
02:51:37.02 --> 02:51:38.02
Seems same.

2755
02:51:38.02 --> 02:51:40.02
I'm going to concede to the point.

2756
02:51:40.02 --> 02:51:41.02
There it is.

2757
02:51:41.02 --> 02:51:42.02
Boom.

2758
02:51:42.02 --> 02:51:43.02
I have a store.

2759
02:51:43.02 --> 02:51:44.02
That's what I don't like about it.

2760
02:51:44.02 --> 02:51:45.02
I don't know.

2761
02:51:45.02 --> 02:51:48.02
But when I say it, I think it sounds cool.

2762
02:51:48.02 --> 02:51:49.02
Sure.

2763
02:51:49.02 --> 02:51:50.02
It's on there.

2764
02:51:50.02 --> 02:51:53.02
If you want to wear T shirts and represent.

2765
02:51:53.02 --> 02:51:55.02
Got a new design out there.

2766
02:51:55.02 --> 02:51:58.02
Well, kind of new two weeks, three weeks, maybe.

2767
02:51:58.02 --> 02:51:59.02
Yeah.

2768
02:51:59.02 --> 02:52:01.02
And actually it's a new T shirt design.

2769
02:52:01.02 --> 02:52:04.02
It could be found in other places.

2770
02:52:04.02 --> 02:52:05.02
Oh, yeah.

2771
02:52:05.02 --> 02:52:06.02
Right.

2772
02:52:06.02 --> 02:52:07.02
Sure.

2773
02:52:07.02 --> 02:52:08.02
What do you mean?

2774
02:52:08.02 --> 02:52:09.02
I mean.

2775
02:52:09.02 --> 02:52:10.02
All right.

2776
02:52:10.02 --> 02:52:11.02
Great.

2777
02:52:11.02 --> 02:52:12.02
We found in other places.

2778
02:52:12.02 --> 02:52:13.02
Yeah, man.

2779
02:52:13.02 --> 02:52:14.02
It's good.

2780
02:52:14.02 --> 02:52:15.02
But hey, look.

2781
02:52:15.02 --> 02:52:16.02
Like on the get after it.

2782
02:52:16.02 --> 02:52:17.02
That's where it could be found straight up.

2783
02:52:17.02 --> 02:52:18.02
I don't want to try.

2784
02:52:18.02 --> 02:52:19.02
It's a little game here.

2785
02:52:19.02 --> 02:52:20.02
Like I wasn't going to say anything.

2786
02:52:20.02 --> 02:52:21.02
It's the get after it.

2787
02:52:21.02 --> 02:52:23.02
We got to shirt this as get after it.

2788
02:52:23.02 --> 02:52:25.02
And now one came highly recommended.

2789
02:52:25.02 --> 02:52:26.02
Perfect.

2790
02:52:26.02 --> 02:52:28.02
Perfect example of people saying, you know,

2791
02:52:28.02 --> 02:52:31.02
people were saying it so like like mad.

2792
02:52:31.02 --> 02:52:35.02
It's the fact is yeah, where it was to the point where they were like,

2793
02:52:35.02 --> 02:52:37.02
Hey, you should you should do it.

2794
02:52:37.02 --> 02:52:38.02
Get after it.

2795
02:52:38.02 --> 02:52:38.02
Sure.

2796
02:52:38.02 --> 02:52:39.02
They weren't saying that anymore.

2797
02:52:39.02 --> 02:52:41.02
They were saying when the get after it.

2798
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:41.02
Sure.

2799
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:42.02
Come out when do they come out?

2800
02:52:42.02 --> 02:52:44.02
I didn't know we were doing that yet.

2801
02:52:44.02 --> 02:52:46.02
But apparently we are so boom.

2802
02:52:46.02 --> 02:52:47.02
They're out.

2803
02:52:47.02 --> 02:52:48.02
They got you.

2804
02:52:48.02 --> 02:52:49.02
They got you with psychological work.

2805
02:52:49.02 --> 02:52:50.02
Man, I'm glad they did.

2806
02:52:50.02 --> 02:52:52.02
Because I think they turned out good.

2807
02:52:52.02 --> 02:52:53.02
I'm real simple.

2808
02:52:53.02 --> 02:52:54.02
Like most things.

2809
02:52:54.02 --> 02:52:55.02
You know, these shirts are cool.

2810
02:52:55.02 --> 02:52:56.02
I think.

2811
02:52:56.02 --> 02:52:59.02
But go to jockelstore.com and look at them.

2812
02:52:59.02 --> 02:53:00.02
You think they're cool.

2813
02:53:00.02 --> 02:53:03.02
You think you want to wear one represent in the wild.

2814
02:53:03.02 --> 02:53:04.02
Go ahead.

2815
02:53:04.02 --> 02:53:06.02
Get one support one now.

2816
02:53:06.02 --> 02:53:10.02
I also some, you know, some women stuff out there.

2817
02:53:10.02 --> 02:53:13.02
Women might be underrepresented overall.

2818
02:53:13.02 --> 02:53:19.02
But I think that the women that are kind of in the game that listen.

2819
02:53:19.02 --> 02:53:20.02
They get after it.

2820
02:53:20.02 --> 02:53:23.02
They get after it hard to make up for the numbers.

2821
02:53:23.02 --> 02:53:25.02
You know, you seem saying like the quality.

2822
02:53:25.02 --> 02:53:27.02
It's greater than the quantity.

2823
02:53:27.02 --> 02:53:29.02
Anyway, I got some patches on there too.

2824
02:53:29.02 --> 02:53:30.02
The rash guards, of course.

2825
02:53:30.02 --> 02:53:31.02
I'm going to put a new one out.

2826
02:53:31.02 --> 02:53:32.02
It's in the works.

2827
02:53:32.02 --> 02:53:36.02
It's like ready to be pushed out in a few days.

2828
02:53:36.02 --> 02:53:38.02
I think maybe a week.

2829
02:53:38.02 --> 02:53:44.02
So yeah, if you're into jiu-jitsu, that's why I think that's the primary reason I made them.

2830
02:53:44.02 --> 02:53:47.02
But they're actually for surfing.

2831
02:53:47.02 --> 02:53:49.02
Body boarding.

2832
02:53:49.02 --> 02:53:50.02
What jockels?

2833
02:53:50.02 --> 02:53:51.02
Spunging.

2834
02:53:51.02 --> 02:53:52.02
Spud.

2835
02:53:52.02 --> 02:53:53.02
Cycling.

2836
02:53:53.02 --> 02:53:54.02
Crossfit.

2837
02:53:54.02 --> 02:54:00.02
Any kind of workout where you need, you know, like maximum mobility, but you still want to go with like a shirt on.

2838
02:54:00.02 --> 02:54:03.02
Sometimes you just go no shirt.

2839
02:54:03.02 --> 02:54:04.02
But yeah.

2840
02:54:04.02 --> 02:54:07.02
If you go no shirt, you're not supported in the podcast.

2841
02:54:07.02 --> 02:54:08.02
Correct.

2842
02:54:08.02 --> 02:54:09.02
Correct.

2843
02:54:09.02 --> 02:54:14.02
And, you know, that the, I think, you know, we kind of did some calculations.

2844
02:54:14.02 --> 02:54:17.02
I think the new rash guard might, I'm not saying it will because we don't know yet.

2845
02:54:17.02 --> 02:54:18.02
They're not here.

2846
02:54:18.02 --> 02:54:19.02
They might yield.

2847
02:54:19.02 --> 02:54:21.02
Was it 24?

2848
02:54:21.02 --> 02:54:23.02
Oh, so echo did.

2849
02:54:23.02 --> 02:54:25.02
He's got the sample one.

2850
02:54:25.02 --> 02:54:26.02
You'll want some.

2851
02:54:26.02 --> 02:54:30.02
And the sample one, you said, give you like 27%

2852
02:54:30.02 --> 02:54:32.02
I thought I'm a bandage.

2853
02:54:32.02 --> 02:54:33.02
24.

2854
02:54:33.02 --> 02:54:35.02
But you know what, now that you mentioned it, I think it was 27.

2855
02:54:35.02 --> 02:54:36.02
Yeah.

2856
02:54:36.02 --> 02:54:37.02
Yes.

2857
02:54:37.02 --> 02:54:38.02
Up from 19.

2858
02:54:38.02 --> 02:54:39.02
Yeah, which is a lot.

2859
02:54:39.02 --> 02:54:41.02
But that's only one case study.

2860
02:54:41.02 --> 02:54:42.02
So that's what I'm saying.

2861
02:54:42.02 --> 02:54:44.02
We're really good at, um, double blind.

2862
02:54:44.02 --> 02:54:45.02
Ten.

2863
02:54:45.02 --> 02:54:47.02
This is actually true where I went and I practiced.

2864
02:54:47.02 --> 02:54:48.02
I did some rounds.

2865
02:54:48.02 --> 02:54:51.02
And you look like when you're done rounds and you're kind of talking with the boys afterwards.

2866
02:54:51.02 --> 02:54:52.02
Yeah.

2867
02:54:52.02 --> 02:54:54.02
And girls in our case because Kaylee was there too.

2868
02:54:54.02 --> 02:54:55.02
We're talking.

2869
02:54:55.02 --> 02:54:56.02
And I thought we were done.

2870
02:54:56.02 --> 02:54:57.02
We were done.

2871
02:54:57.02 --> 02:54:58.02
Somebody called.

2872
02:54:58.02 --> 02:54:59.02
You're like, hey guys, co.

2873
02:54:59.02 --> 02:55:01.02
And then David,

2874
02:55:01.02 --> 02:55:03.02
Sesame's bulia.

2875
02:55:03.02 --> 02:55:05.02
He's like, oh, hold the holdings.

2876
02:55:05.02 --> 02:55:06.02
Yeah.

2877
02:55:06.02 --> 02:55:09.02
nephew, like, actually actual nephew, like,

2878
02:55:09.02 --> 02:55:11.02
his dad's brother or something.

2879
02:55:11.02 --> 02:55:12.02
I might get that part wrong.

2880
02:55:12.02 --> 02:55:13.02
But it's yeah, anyway.

2881
02:55:13.02 --> 02:55:14.02
That's a side note.

2882
02:55:14.02 --> 02:55:15.02
He called you out.

2883
02:55:15.02 --> 02:55:16.02
Yeah.

2884
02:55:16.02 --> 02:55:17.02
Well, he asks.

2885
02:55:17.02 --> 02:55:18.02
He wants to roll in and go.

2886
02:55:18.02 --> 02:55:22.02
He goes, what?

2887
02:55:22.02 --> 02:55:23.02
It's to the rounds left.

2888
02:55:23.02 --> 02:55:24.02
Shrimp tech.

2889
02:55:24.02 --> 02:55:25.02
Rashguard.

2890
02:55:25.02 --> 02:55:26.02
That's it.

2891
02:55:26.02 --> 02:55:26.02
Yeah.

2892
02:55:26.02 --> 02:55:27.02
We've got it wrong with the lead.

2893
02:55:27.02 --> 02:55:28.02
Anyway, yeah.

2894
02:55:28.02 --> 02:55:28.02
Good.

2895
02:55:28.02 --> 02:55:29.02
Good deal.

2896
02:55:29.02 --> 02:55:30.02
Good experience.

2897
02:55:30.02 --> 02:55:32.02
But that's got a good deep half guard.

2898
02:55:32.02 --> 02:55:33.02
Yeah.

2899
02:55:33.02 --> 02:55:34.02
He has good.

2900
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:34.02
Yeah.

2901
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:34.02
Yeah.

2902
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:35.02
But he's deep half guard.

2903
02:55:35.02 --> 02:55:37.02
He's got because he's, he's a bigger dude.

2904
02:55:37.02 --> 02:55:39.02
But he got the depth of the guard.

2905
02:55:39.02 --> 02:55:39.02
Yeah.

2906
02:55:39.02 --> 02:55:40.02
He's bigger than Jeff.

2907
02:55:40.02 --> 02:55:41.02
He's got a good.

2908
02:55:41.02 --> 02:55:42.02
He's trimmed up a little bit.

2909
02:55:42.02 --> 02:55:44.02
But nonetheless, yeah, good.

2910
02:55:44.02 --> 02:55:45.02
Good training.

2911
02:55:45.02 --> 02:55:46.02
Also.

2912
02:55:46.02 --> 02:55:47.02
Psychological work.

2913
02:55:47.02 --> 02:55:48.02
Psychological warfare.

2914
02:55:48.02 --> 02:55:54.02
So if you know what that is, it's an album with tracks, juggle talking.

2915
02:55:54.02 --> 02:55:56.02
But he's not just talking.

2916
02:55:56.02 --> 02:56:01.02
He's talking with the intent of getting you through any moments of weakness that you might

2917
02:56:01.02 --> 02:56:05.02
have in your getting after it journey.

2918
02:56:05.02 --> 02:56:07.02
Isn't it goes beyond might have?

2919
02:56:07.02 --> 02:56:08.02
Right.

2920
02:56:08.02 --> 02:56:09.02
It goes into actual moments of weakness.

2921
02:56:09.02 --> 02:56:11.02
Not that you are in a moment of weakness.

2922
02:56:11.02 --> 02:56:13.02
You're looking at actual donuts.

2923
02:56:13.02 --> 02:56:14.02
They're in front of you.

2924
02:56:14.02 --> 02:56:15.02
Right.

2925
02:56:15.02 --> 02:56:16.02
They're breaking you down mentally.

2926
02:56:16.02 --> 02:56:17.02
Right.

2927
02:56:17.02 --> 02:56:18.02
Don't click that.

2928
02:56:18.02 --> 02:56:19.02
No.

2929
02:56:19.02 --> 02:56:20.02
Hit play.

2930
02:56:20.02 --> 02:56:21.02
Hit play.

2931
02:56:21.02 --> 02:56:22.02
Get the track in there.

2932
02:56:22.02 --> 02:56:23.02
The actual monotopotential moment of weakness.

2933
02:56:23.02 --> 02:56:24.02
They're the moment of weakness is upon us.

2934
02:56:24.02 --> 02:56:26.02
We're going to feed it.

2935
02:56:26.02 --> 02:56:27.02
Yeah.

2936
02:56:27.02 --> 02:56:28.02
Psychological warfare.

2937
02:56:28.02 --> 02:56:29.02
Yeah.

2938
02:56:29.02 --> 02:56:31.02
And we're getting requests now for the second one.

2939
02:56:31.02 --> 02:56:32.02
Yeah.

2940
02:56:32.02 --> 02:56:34.02
So I'm going to start thinking about that.

2941
02:56:34.02 --> 02:56:35.02
What that's going to be like.

2942
02:56:35.02 --> 02:56:36.02
Yeah.

2943
02:56:36.02 --> 02:56:39.02
And if you want recommendations of what particular moments of weakness that you might have that

2944
02:56:39.02 --> 02:56:40.02
need to be overcome.

2945
02:56:40.02 --> 02:56:43.02
And there's a common theme as echo referred to.

2946
02:56:43.02 --> 02:56:47.02
And if it's got to be something that I've dealt with before.

2947
02:56:47.02 --> 02:56:48.02
Right.

2948
02:56:48.02 --> 02:56:54.02
Because I can't just make up some way of overcoming a weakness that I've never experienced.

2949
02:56:54.02 --> 02:56:56.02
Now I've experienced a lot of weaknesses.

2950
02:56:56.02 --> 02:57:00.02
But if you come up with something that I've never experienced, then we're going to have to just

2951
02:57:00.02 --> 02:57:01.02
forgo that one.

2952
02:57:01.02 --> 02:57:03.02
Because I'm not going to make it up for go.

2953
02:57:03.02 --> 02:57:05.02
I'm not going to make up with the brand might not work.

2954
02:57:05.02 --> 02:57:06.02
Right.

2955
02:57:06.02 --> 02:57:07.02
It's hard to manufacture.

2956
02:57:07.02 --> 02:57:08.02
You can manufacture in Sparado.

2957
02:57:08.02 --> 02:57:10.02
That's the great.

2958
02:57:10.02 --> 02:57:13.02
Yeah.

2959
02:57:13.02 --> 02:57:14.02
Yeah.

2960
02:57:14.02 --> 02:57:15.02
I got some.

2961
02:57:15.02 --> 02:57:16.02
Oh, talk about that.

2962
02:57:16.02 --> 02:57:17.02
It's from a quiet dude.

2963
02:57:17.02 --> 02:57:19.02
That's where it's going to come from.

2964
02:57:19.02 --> 02:57:20.02
Sure.

2965
02:57:20.02 --> 02:57:21.02
A still one.

2966
02:57:21.02 --> 02:57:22.02
That's a quiet dude.

2967
02:57:22.02 --> 02:57:25.02
That's a good on psychological warfare.

2968
02:57:25.02 --> 02:57:26.02
Joccal wheeling.

2969
02:57:26.02 --> 02:57:28.02
iTunes, Amazon music.

2970
02:57:28.02 --> 02:57:29.02
All those good.

2971
02:57:29.02 --> 02:57:30.02
It's probably any music outlet.

2972
02:57:30.02 --> 02:57:32.02
A bunch of music outlets here.

2973
02:57:32.02 --> 02:57:33.02
Yeah.

2974
02:57:33.02 --> 02:57:34.02
Yeah.

2975
02:57:34.02 --> 02:57:34.02
Just jump on that.

2976
02:57:34.02 --> 02:57:35.02
It helps.

2977
02:57:35.02 --> 02:57:36.02
And I use it.

2978
02:57:36.02 --> 02:57:37.02
I don't recommend this.

2979
02:57:37.02 --> 02:57:39.02
But I used it.

2980
02:57:39.02 --> 02:57:40.02
I don't feel like working out.

2981
02:57:40.02 --> 02:57:42.02
This is a big thing for me because I kind of had it like that.

2982
02:57:42.02 --> 02:57:48.02
Well, I'll be like, oh, I'm just going to rest because I don't feel like I didn't get nine hours of sleep songs to it tomorrow.

2983
02:57:48.02 --> 02:57:49.02
No.

2984
02:57:49.02 --> 02:57:50.02
Yeah.

2985
02:57:50.02 --> 02:57:52.02
Man, and it really worked with that.

2986
02:57:52.02 --> 02:57:53.02
The workout one.

2987
02:57:53.02 --> 02:57:56.02
A guy, you know, you said it works 100% of the time.

2988
02:57:56.02 --> 02:57:57.02
Yes.

2989
02:57:57.02 --> 02:57:58.02
Like the wake up one.

2990
02:57:58.02 --> 02:57:59.02
Yeah.

2991
02:57:59.02 --> 02:58:00.02
Because there's three wake up tracks.

2992
02:58:00.02 --> 02:58:04.02
A guy on Twitter said a number of wake up track didn't work.

2993
02:58:04.02 --> 02:58:05.02
It failed.

2994
02:58:05.02 --> 02:58:06.02
Interesting.

2995
02:58:06.02 --> 02:58:08.02
And then he said, but I made it to the number two.

2996
02:58:08.02 --> 02:58:10.02
Wake up track, which is the way they're set.

2997
02:58:10.02 --> 02:58:12.02
They're set like you listen to one.

2998
02:58:12.02 --> 02:58:13.02
That's going to get you up.

2999
02:58:13.02 --> 02:58:14.02
But if it doesn't number two is waiting.

3000
02:58:14.02 --> 02:58:15.02
Right.

3001
02:58:15.02 --> 02:58:16.02
And you got the number two and then he woke up.

3002
02:58:16.02 --> 02:58:19.02
So we're still batting a thousand.

3003
02:58:19.02 --> 02:58:20.02
Overall.

3004
02:58:20.02 --> 02:58:21.02
Yeah.

3005
02:58:21.02 --> 02:58:22.02
The overall campaign, right?

3006
02:58:22.02 --> 02:58:22.02
Yeah.

3007
02:58:22.02 --> 02:58:23.02
The campaign is a win.

3008
02:58:23.02 --> 02:58:29.02
But we did take a bigger from one dude that just didn't get out of bed after listening to psychological warfare.

3009
02:58:29.02 --> 02:58:31.02
Get out of bed track for one.

3010
02:58:31.02 --> 02:58:32.02
He had to go to track to.

3011
02:58:32.02 --> 02:58:33.02
But we're there.

3012
02:58:33.02 --> 02:58:34.02
Yeah.

3013
02:58:34.02 --> 02:58:35.02
He had some reserves.

3014
02:58:35.02 --> 02:58:36.02
Got some backup.

3015
02:58:36.02 --> 02:58:37.02
That's what we had for that.

3016
02:58:37.02 --> 02:58:39.02
But I don't think anyone's made it to three yet.

3017
02:58:39.02 --> 02:58:41.02
No one's made it to the wake up track for you.

3018
02:58:41.02 --> 02:58:42.02
And then they're, yeah.

3019
02:58:42.02 --> 02:58:44.02
That must to make it even to make it to two.

3020
02:58:44.02 --> 02:58:45.02
You must be one tired dude.

3021
02:58:45.02 --> 02:58:48.02
You must have had like a hard night.

3022
02:58:48.02 --> 02:58:48.02
Night.

3023
02:58:48.02 --> 02:58:49.02
And then before.

3024
02:58:49.02 --> 02:58:52.02
And you must have hard workout waiting for your son on it on something.

3025
02:58:52.02 --> 02:58:53.02
But yeah.

3026
02:58:53.02 --> 02:58:55.02
I mean, my experience hundred percent success rate.

3027
02:58:55.02 --> 02:58:56.02
But I don't.

3028
02:58:56.02 --> 02:59:01.02
And then I started doing it just because just because I want to get fired up.

3029
02:59:01.02 --> 02:59:02.02
Yeah.

3030
02:59:02.02 --> 02:59:03.02
And it's weird because it's not.

3031
02:59:03.02 --> 02:59:07.02
It's not that.

3032
02:59:07.02 --> 02:59:08.02
It's almost like this.

3033
02:59:08.02 --> 02:59:09.02
Yeah.

3034
02:59:09.02 --> 02:59:11.02
Some people say to me, Hey, can you do one of you yelling?

3035
02:59:11.02 --> 02:59:13.02
I'm like, Why don't we yell a lot, man?

3036
02:59:13.02 --> 02:59:15.02
Like I didn't get on my yeller.

3037
02:59:15.02 --> 02:59:16.02
Yeah.

3038
02:59:16.02 --> 02:59:17.02
Now, let me see the me present.

3039
02:59:17.02 --> 02:59:21.02
If we're in the gym and like I'm pushing someone like a MMA fighter.

3040
02:59:21.02 --> 02:59:22.02
That's in a workout.

3041
02:59:22.02 --> 02:59:23.02
I'm going to come on.

3042
02:59:23.02 --> 02:59:24.02
You know, I might raise my voice a little bit.

3043
02:59:24.02 --> 02:59:26.02
But I'm not going to yell at you.

3044
02:59:26.02 --> 02:59:29.02
You know, the drone structure type thing.

3045
02:59:29.02 --> 02:59:30.02
It's not this not.

3046
02:59:30.02 --> 02:59:31.02
Yeah.

3047
02:59:31.02 --> 02:59:34.02
What I do and I could see maybe like how that could be effective.

3048
02:59:34.02 --> 02:59:37.02
But in these cases, that's not the mood you're in anywhere.

3049
02:59:37.02 --> 02:59:38.02
You know what?

3050
02:59:38.02 --> 02:59:40.02
It could be effective for certain instances.

3051
02:59:40.02 --> 02:59:41.02
Yes.

3052
02:59:41.02 --> 02:59:44.02
And actually, like I've been doing some little videos in the morning.

3053
02:59:44.02 --> 02:59:48.02
Oh, and and and I realize when I watch them,

3054
02:59:48.02 --> 02:59:51.02
that I'm getting a little bit aggressive with the way I'm talking.

3055
02:59:51.02 --> 02:59:52.02
And it's not.

3056
02:59:52.02 --> 02:59:53.02
It's not like I'm saying, Okay, I could.

3057
02:59:53.02 --> 02:59:56.02
No, I'm just starting to talk and then I start getting naturally.

3058
02:59:56.02 --> 03:00:00.02
I start escalating my own situation because I'm starting to think about when I'm

3059
03:00:00.02 --> 03:00:03.02
saying it means something to me.

3060
03:00:03.02 --> 03:00:04.02
Right.

3061
03:00:04.02 --> 03:00:06.02
So when I'm saying hey, you know, you're wasting your life right now.

3062
03:00:06.02 --> 03:00:10.02
I start thinking, I feel in that way because I know that there's someone that's actually

3063
03:00:10.02 --> 03:00:11.02
wasting their life right now.

3064
03:00:11.02 --> 03:00:15.02
And so it starts, you know, getting a little bit escalated.

3065
03:00:15.02 --> 03:00:20.02
And so maybe on psychological warfare too, there'll be some situation that

3066
03:00:20.02 --> 03:00:23.02
that I personally escalate on.

3067
03:00:23.02 --> 03:00:24.02
Yeah.

3068
03:00:24.02 --> 03:00:25.02
What does it be natural, right?

3069
03:00:25.02 --> 03:00:26.02
Kind of thing.

3070
03:00:26.02 --> 03:00:27.02
Yeah.

3071
03:00:27.02 --> 03:00:28.02
Because you can have manufacturer in Sparato.

3072
03:00:28.02 --> 03:00:29.02
Yeah.

3073
03:00:29.02 --> 03:00:30.02
There he go.

3074
03:00:30.02 --> 03:00:31.02
But yeah, it's good.

3075
03:00:31.02 --> 03:00:35.02
It's like because you just kind of explain, like kind of the logic behind it.

3076
03:00:35.02 --> 03:00:37.02
Like see what you're doing right now.

3077
03:00:37.02 --> 03:00:38.02
But do you see that?

3078
03:00:38.02 --> 03:00:38.02
Yeah.

3079
03:00:38.02 --> 03:00:40.02
Well, I guess now I do shoot.

3080
03:00:40.02 --> 03:00:41.02
Then you get up.

3081
03:00:41.02 --> 03:00:44.02
You know, yeah, I use it when it's now.

3082
03:00:44.02 --> 03:00:45.02
Sometimes I abuse it.

3083
03:00:45.02 --> 03:00:46.02
Well, I don't know.

3084
03:00:46.02 --> 03:00:47.02
I'm feeling fired up and just put it in.

3085
03:00:47.02 --> 03:00:48.02
Get more fired up.

3086
03:00:48.02 --> 03:00:51.02
Get talked into feeling even better.

3087
03:00:51.02 --> 03:00:53.02
That's how dangerous things are.

3088
03:00:53.02 --> 03:00:54.02
It's like a lot of work.

3089
03:00:54.02 --> 03:00:55.02
It's good one.

3090
03:00:55.02 --> 03:00:57.02
Also when you're clicking through Amazon, you can also get

3091
03:00:57.02 --> 03:01:02.02
a good chocolate tea, which it may not seem like a big deal.

3092
03:01:02.02 --> 03:01:05.02
And maybe it isn't, but maybe it is.

3093
03:01:05.02 --> 03:01:13.02
I tell you, judging from some of the, some of the reviews on Amazon, I'm really doing.

3094
03:01:13.02 --> 03:01:20.02
After drinking, jacquawait tea, I found I was overcome with the insurmountable urge to get after it.

3095
03:01:20.02 --> 03:01:26.82
So much so that I was able to defeat all my foes in a short amount of time on a side

3096
03:01:26.82 --> 03:01:32.82
note, I found that jacquawait tea is best served over ice and consumed from the skulls of dead enemies.

3097
03:01:32.82 --> 03:01:37.82
Now, you know, I don't know what situation this individual is in, right?

3098
03:01:37.82 --> 03:01:39.82
But obviously he's in combat situation.

3099
03:01:39.82 --> 03:01:43.82
He's got foes that need to be killed and he's drinking from their skulls.

3100
03:01:43.82 --> 03:01:48.82
And even in that really stressful environment, you know, the tea's helping him, which is cool.

3101
03:01:48.82 --> 03:01:54.82
I'm glad that it's helping him doing positive things against the enemies of good in the world.

3102
03:01:54.82 --> 03:02:01.82
Also, good evening, echo in jacquaw, I woke up weighing 115 pounds the day the white tea arrives.

3103
03:02:01.82 --> 03:02:05.82
Two cups later I re-weight myself and I was now roughly 250 pounds.

3104
03:02:05.82 --> 03:02:11.82
So he more than doubled his body weight after two cups of jacquawait tea.

3105
03:02:11.82 --> 03:02:18.82
I think my tea was a little loaded and obviously gave me more than the 20% increase in gains that was promised.

3106
03:02:18.82 --> 03:02:23.82
And I don't think we actually promised anything. I didn't promise that, but I think it kind of speaks for itself.

3107
03:02:23.82 --> 03:02:28.82
And this is the important. This is why I wanted to make this one very important.

3108
03:02:28.82 --> 03:02:34.82
Also, cruising went up roughly 200%. So there's that as well.

3109
03:02:34.82 --> 03:02:36.82
So yeah, it's very bad for everybody.

3110
03:02:36.82 --> 03:02:43.82
Well, you know, and there you go. Scientific cruising is up 200% which is positive.

3111
03:02:43.82 --> 03:02:48.82
Also, way of the warrior kid, I got the first hard coffee.

3112
03:02:48.82 --> 03:02:53.82
I got it in my hands. They sent me one. They're sending me more.

3113
03:02:53.82 --> 03:02:57.82
But, you know, how dang it's three hours right now.

3114
03:02:57.82 --> 03:02:59.82
We've been talking for three hours.

3115
03:02:59.82 --> 03:03:01.82
That's my fault.

3116
03:03:01.82 --> 03:03:03.82
Oh, man, that's a long time.

3117
03:03:03.82 --> 03:03:06.82
And I was going to read a little excerpt.

3118
03:03:06.82 --> 03:03:08.82
And I think I'm going to do this.

3119
03:03:08.82 --> 03:03:09.82
It's already been three hours.

3120
03:03:09.82 --> 03:03:17.82
But, but so, young Mark is, he's going to jump off this bridge.

3121
03:03:17.82 --> 03:03:19.82
He couldn't swim in the beginning of the book.

3122
03:03:19.82 --> 03:03:20.82
Now he knows how to swim.

3123
03:03:20.82 --> 03:03:22.82
But his goal is to jump off the bridge into the river.

3124
03:03:22.82 --> 03:03:24.82
And he goes up there to do it.

3125
03:03:24.82 --> 03:03:28.82
And he's scared. He gets scared. He's not going to just, he just can't jump.

3126
03:03:28.82 --> 03:03:32.82
So Uncle Jake, who used to be a seal?

3127
03:03:32.82 --> 03:03:35.82
Who's now with his young nephew trying to show him the warrior way.

3128
03:03:35.82 --> 03:03:37.82
Goes up on the bridge.

3129
03:03:37.82 --> 03:03:38.82
And he said, what's going on, buddy?

3130
03:03:38.82 --> 03:03:40.82
He said in a calm voice, I don't know.

3131
03:03:40.82 --> 03:03:44.82
I said, I'm just, I'm just, you're afraid, aren't you?

3132
03:03:44.82 --> 03:03:46.82
Uncle Jake asked.

3133
03:03:46.82 --> 03:03:48.82
But he wasn't even asking.

3134
03:03:48.82 --> 03:03:51.82
He knew. He knew I was scared.

3135
03:03:51.82 --> 03:03:54.82
There was no point denying it.

3136
03:03:54.82 --> 03:03:57.82
Uncle Jake knew it as plain as day.

3137
03:03:57.82 --> 03:03:59.82
Yes.

3138
03:03:59.82 --> 03:04:03.82
I finally said in a quiet tone, two embarrassed that I was afraid.

3139
03:04:03.82 --> 03:04:07.82
Then, to my surprise, Uncle Jake said, that's normal.

3140
03:04:07.82 --> 03:04:10.82
What? I responded?

3141
03:04:10.82 --> 03:04:12.82
Shocked at Uncle Jake statement.

3142
03:04:12.82 --> 03:04:14.82
I said, that's normal.

3143
03:04:14.82 --> 03:04:18.82
You're doing something you've never done before, so it's normal to be a little hesitant.

3144
03:04:18.82 --> 03:04:20.82
It's called fear.

3145
03:04:20.82 --> 03:04:24.82
It's a normal emotion, and it's okay.

3146
03:04:24.82 --> 03:04:29.82
Then he added, well, it's okay as long as you can control it.

3147
03:04:29.82 --> 03:04:31.82
This made no sense to me.

3148
03:04:31.82 --> 03:04:33.82
How am I supposed to control fear?

3149
03:04:33.82 --> 03:04:37.82
And how would you know? You're not afraid of anything.

3150
03:04:37.82 --> 03:04:40.82
Uncle Jake sat quietly for a minute.

3151
03:04:40.82 --> 03:04:45.82
Then he said, I wish that were true.

3152
03:04:45.82 --> 03:04:48.82
What do you mean? I asked him.

3153
03:04:48.82 --> 03:04:51.82
Well, you said, I'm not afraid of anything.

3154
03:04:51.82 --> 03:04:53.82
And that is just not true.

3155
03:04:53.82 --> 03:04:54.82
Fear is normal.

3156
03:04:54.82 --> 03:04:57.82
In fact, fear is good.

3157
03:04:57.82 --> 03:05:00.82
Fear is what warns you and things are dangerous.

3158
03:05:00.82 --> 03:05:02.82
Fear is what makes you prepare.

3159
03:05:02.82 --> 03:05:05.82
Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble.

3160
03:05:05.82 --> 03:05:08.82
So there's nothing wrong with fear.

3161
03:05:08.82 --> 03:05:11.82
But fear can also be overwhelming.

3162
03:05:11.82 --> 03:05:13.82
It can be unreasonable.

3163
03:05:13.82 --> 03:05:20.82
It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions or hesitate when you need to act.

3164
03:05:20.82 --> 03:05:24.82
So you have to learn to control fear,

3165
03:05:24.82 --> 03:05:28.82
and that's what you need to do right now.

3166
03:05:28.82 --> 03:05:33.82
Okay, that sounds great, and I would really love to make you happy and overcome my fear,

3167
03:05:33.82 --> 03:05:35.82
but I don't know how.

3168
03:05:35.82 --> 03:05:38.82
Uncle Jake thought about that.

3169
03:05:38.82 --> 03:05:44.82
About what I just said for a few seconds, and then he said, okay, well,

3170
03:05:44.82 --> 03:05:47.82
the first part of controlling fear you've already done.

3171
03:05:47.82 --> 03:05:49.82
And that is preparation.

3172
03:05:49.82 --> 03:05:55.82
You've done plenty of preparation to be ready for this moment to face this fear.

3173
03:05:55.82 --> 03:05:57.82
Starting with dunking your head,

3174
03:05:57.82 --> 03:06:00.82
all the way up to swimming all around and back and forth across this river,

3175
03:06:00.82 --> 03:06:04.82
you've done little jumps off the riverbank.

3176
03:06:04.82 --> 03:06:09.82
All of the last several weeks have been preparing you for this, this jump.

3177
03:06:09.82 --> 03:06:14.82
And all that preparation works to help overcome the fear.

3178
03:06:14.82 --> 03:06:18.82
Imagine how scared you would be if you still didn't know how to swim.

3179
03:06:18.82 --> 03:06:22.82
You would be horrified, but you have prepared.

3180
03:06:22.82 --> 03:06:24.82
Then why am I still scared?

3181
03:06:24.82 --> 03:06:27.82
I asked Uncle Jake simple, he said,

3182
03:06:27.82 --> 03:06:30.82
because there's still an element of the unknown.

3183
03:06:30.82 --> 03:06:35.82
You've never jumped off anything this high before, so you don't know what it feels like.

3184
03:06:35.82 --> 03:06:40.82
People are afraid of what they don't know or what they don't understand,

3185
03:06:40.82 --> 03:06:42.82
but you have prepared.

3186
03:06:42.82 --> 03:06:46.82
You know it is safe, you know you are ready.

3187
03:06:46.82 --> 03:06:50.82
It's just this last little bit of fear that has to be overcome.

3188
03:06:50.82 --> 03:06:52.82
And you know how you do that?

3189
03:06:52.82 --> 03:06:57.82
I have no idea, I told him, you go.

3190
03:06:57.82 --> 03:07:00.82
Just go, I asked Uncle Jake,

3191
03:07:00.82 --> 03:07:04.82
now partly thinking he was just joking, yes, you just go.

3192
03:07:04.82 --> 03:07:06.82
You see fear lives in the moment,

3193
03:07:06.82 --> 03:07:10.82
that powerful moment between when you decide you are going to do something

3194
03:07:10.82 --> 03:07:12.82
and when you do it.

3195
03:07:12.82 --> 03:07:16.82
Once you go, once you start, you won't be afraid anymore.

3196
03:07:16.82 --> 03:07:19.82
You overcome fear by going.

3197
03:07:19.82 --> 03:07:22.82
And it is the same in many aspects of life,

3198
03:07:22.82 --> 03:07:24.82
parachuting, talking in front of a crowd,

3199
03:07:24.82 --> 03:07:28.82
taking a test, running a race, competing in jujitsu.

3200
03:07:28.82 --> 03:07:31.82
The fear is in the waiting.

3201
03:07:31.82 --> 03:07:34.82
So, once you have planned,

3202
03:07:34.82 --> 03:07:38.82
once you have prepared and trained and studied,

3203
03:07:38.82 --> 03:07:41.82
there is only one thing left to do.

3204
03:07:41.82 --> 03:07:43.82
Go.

3205
03:07:43.82 --> 03:07:44.82
And that's it?

3206
03:07:44.82 --> 03:07:47.82
Yes, that's it.

3207
03:07:47.82 --> 03:07:49.82
As soon as Uncle Jake finished those words,

3208
03:07:49.82 --> 03:07:52.82
he stood up, looked at me, yelled out,

3209
03:07:52.82 --> 03:07:55.82
who y'all jumped off the bridge.

3210
03:07:55.82 --> 03:07:58.82
Just go, I fought to myself.

3211
03:07:58.82 --> 03:08:01.82
I stood up, stepped up onto the edge of the wall

3212
03:08:01.82 --> 03:08:03.82
and looked down at Uncle Jake,

3213
03:08:03.82 --> 03:08:04.82
who had just come back to the surface

3214
03:08:04.82 --> 03:08:07.82
and was looking up at me with a big smile on his face.

3215
03:08:07.82 --> 03:08:10.82
With all my heart and lungs, I yelled out,

3216
03:08:10.82 --> 03:08:13.82
who y'all, and stepped off the bridge,

3217
03:08:13.82 --> 03:08:16.82
passed my fear and into the unknown.

3218
03:08:16.82 --> 03:08:19.82
I felt myself falling for a while

3219
03:08:19.82 --> 03:08:22.82
and didn't wish I was in the water.

3220
03:08:22.82 --> 03:08:26.82
I came to the surface and had a big smile on my face.

3221
03:08:26.82 --> 03:08:31.82
I can fly, I yelled, I can fly.

3222
03:08:31.82 --> 03:08:35.82
So, little excerpt.

3223
03:08:35.82 --> 03:08:37.82
Dang, that was good, man.

3224
03:08:37.82 --> 03:08:40.82
On the way of the warrior kid, it comes out May 2nd.

3225
03:08:40.82 --> 03:08:46.82
So, go and go order the book for you,

3226
03:08:46.82 --> 03:08:49.82
for your kid, for your neighbor, for your nephew,

3227
03:08:49.82 --> 03:08:53.82
for your niece, for the school of library, whatever.

3228
03:08:53.82 --> 03:08:57.82
Order them so the publisher, that's making this book.

3229
03:08:57.82 --> 03:09:01.82
We want them to know that they need to print a bunch of these.

3230
03:09:01.82 --> 03:09:03.82
They don't know that right now.

3231
03:09:03.82 --> 03:09:06.82
They don't know how many kids want to get after it.

3232
03:09:06.82 --> 03:09:09.82
They don't know that.

3233
03:09:09.82 --> 03:09:11.82
They don't know that.

3234
03:09:11.82 --> 03:09:13.82
And they're not going to print enough.

3235
03:09:13.82 --> 03:09:16.82
It's the same thing that happened with Jockel White Team, right?

3236
03:09:16.82 --> 03:09:17.82
You remember that?

3237
03:09:17.82 --> 03:09:18.82
That's shortage.

3238
03:09:18.82 --> 03:09:23.82
The anger of the frustration, the nation-wide-19% drop-in performance across the board.

3239
03:09:23.82 --> 03:09:24.82
You remember that?

3240
03:09:24.82 --> 03:09:26.82
Don't let it happen here, same thing.

3241
03:09:26.82 --> 03:09:29.82
In order that, you can also pre-order,

3242
03:09:29.82 --> 03:09:31.82
discipline equals freedom, field manual,

3243
03:09:31.82 --> 03:09:35.82
comes out October 17th, 1717.

3244
03:09:35.82 --> 03:09:42.82
Hmm, that's the book that you asked for.

3245
03:09:42.82 --> 03:09:44.82
So you can order that one too, and of course,

3246
03:09:44.82 --> 03:09:46.82
extreme ownership.

3247
03:09:46.82 --> 03:09:48.82
You can get that one, people buy it,

3248
03:09:48.82 --> 03:09:50.82
and then they buy it for their team, and it spreads.

3249
03:09:50.82 --> 03:09:53.82
So pick that up for you and your team up and down the chain of command,

3250
03:09:53.82 --> 03:09:55.82
extreme ownership.

3251
03:09:55.82 --> 03:10:02.82
Beyond that, if you want some direct action and interaction with your company that you work out,

3252
03:10:02.82 --> 03:10:05.82
you can contact our company,

3253
03:10:05.82 --> 03:10:08.82
Eshelon Front, Me, Lave Babin,

3254
03:10:08.82 --> 03:10:11.82
JP D'Nel, Dave Burke.

3255
03:10:11.82 --> 03:10:16.82
We can get in the game with you info at Eshelonfront.com.

3256
03:10:16.82 --> 03:10:24.82
Lastly, if you don't know, we have Mr. 002 coming up at the Marriott Grand Marquis in New York City, May 4th and 5th.

3257
03:10:24.82 --> 03:10:30.82
Leadership, strategy, tactics, again, me, Lave, JP, Dave Burke.

3258
03:10:30.82 --> 03:10:36.82
And of course, probably most important echo Charles, he's going to be there.

3259
03:10:36.82 --> 03:10:40.82
And he might try and hide, but he can't.

3260
03:10:40.82 --> 03:10:43.82
Because none of us can, because there's no green room, there's no backstage,

3261
03:10:43.82 --> 03:10:48.82
there's just all of us together, getting after it.

3262
03:10:48.82 --> 03:10:53.82
And of course, before the monster, you can find us.

3263
03:10:53.82 --> 03:10:55.82
What are you cruising?

3264
03:10:55.82 --> 03:11:01.82
Kind of hard on the Interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram,

3265
03:11:01.82 --> 03:11:05.82
and in the face, the book.

3266
03:11:05.82 --> 03:11:12.82
Echo is at Echo Charles, and I am at Jockawilling.

3267
03:11:12.82 --> 03:11:18.82
And finally, thanks to all the service men and women out there who,

3268
03:11:18.82 --> 03:11:25.82
in this uncertain world, and it certainly is an uncertain world today,

3269
03:11:25.82 --> 03:11:34.82
filled with evil, all of you that walk away from the comforts of home, and into the unknown,

3270
03:11:34.82 --> 03:11:38.82
to face our enemies.

3271
03:11:38.82 --> 03:11:46.82
Thank you, to the firefighters, police and law enforcement, EMTs, and the first responders here at home.

3272
03:11:46.82 --> 03:11:54.82
Thank you for what you do day in and day out, putting yourself at risk for us,

3273
03:11:54.82 --> 03:12:01.82
and to everyone else out there, facing what you're facing.

3274
03:12:01.82 --> 03:12:14.82
Challenges that work and challenges with family and challenges with yourself and challenges in your head and challenges with life.

3275
03:12:14.82 --> 03:12:27.82
Remember what you, as a human being, are capable of remember what your will is capable of.

3276
03:12:27.82 --> 03:12:41.82
And then keep moving forward, keep attacking, and keep getting after it.

3277
03:12:41.82 --> 03:12:47.82
So, until next time, this is Echo and Jockaw.

3278
03:12:47.82 --> 03:13:00.82
Out.
