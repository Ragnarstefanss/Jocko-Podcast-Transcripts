00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.40 This is Jocopontcast number 202 with echo Charles and me, a jocowilling. Good evening. Good evening.
00:00:10.52 --> 00:00:18.000 On a bright and violent morning in the central Pacific, a dying marine with part of his face shot off
00:00:18.84 --> 00:00:20.84 saved my life.
00:00:20.84 --> 00:00:21.84 He was
00:00:21.84 --> 00:00:30.84 purged to top the partially raised ramp of an LCVP. He was a big solidly built man with a gaping
00:00:30.84 --> 00:00:37.64 gory hole where his eye should have been. Blood streaming from the wound.
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:42.28 Moments earlier, he had been standing in the water beside me at the bottom of the ramp,
00:00:42.28 --> 00:00:48.56 waiting with the other wounded men for his turn to board. Another casualty in the battle for
00:00:48.56 --> 00:00:57.76 Bayes, you island. I was dying. I'd been shot through the lower abdomen, hit as my unit
00:00:57.76 --> 00:01:04.04 waited toward the shore to assault the island. Two men from my platoon hauled me back to the
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:11.24 LCVP and struggled to lift me into the boat. The marine with the ravaged face who had just
00:01:11.24 --> 00:01:17.44 boarded. Now saw that they were having trouble with me. He reached down, grabbed me with
00:01:17.44 --> 00:01:31.52 one hand and pulled me up and over the top of the ramp. Amazing. And so I didn't die. That too was
00:01:31.52 --> 00:01:40.80 amazing. But not really all that significant in the grand scheme of things. That incident
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:53.92 is just a small scene in a very big picture. So an insignificant event like that. Can you
00:01:53.92 --> 00:02:02.52 imagine being gut shot in waste deep water under heavy machine gunfire, barely making it
00:02:02.52 --> 00:02:07.64 back to a landing craft, which is going to save you, being pulled into that landing craft by
00:02:07.64 --> 00:02:17.96 another wounded marine and surviving? Can you imagine considering that series of events to be
00:02:17.96 --> 00:02:27.40 insignificant? It's almost impossible to think that way. But that excerpt is from a book called
00:02:27.40 --> 00:02:35.40 Faithful Warriors, written by Lieutenant Colonel Dean Ladd, who served as an enlisted
00:02:35.40 --> 00:02:42.52 an officer in the Marine Corps in the Pacific Campaign in World War II. He participated
00:02:42.52 --> 00:02:50.92 in the battles for Guadalcanal, Taroa, Sipan, and Tinian. Battles where tens of thousands
00:02:50.92 --> 00:02:57.32 of Americans were wounded or killed as they fought against the fanatical Japanese imperial
00:02:57.32 --> 00:03:06.92 war machine. And while it's impossible for us to understand what those men actually went through
00:03:06.92 --> 00:03:14.76 and what those battles were like. This book does an amazing job of giving us a glimpse into
00:03:14.76 --> 00:03:27.64 this savage part of war. And it is a complete honor to have the author of this book, Dean Ladd,
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:35.32 here to talk with us about his experiences. Colonel Ladd, welcome to the program. Thank you.
00:03:36.12 --> 00:03:44.20 That's incredible. The things that you went through in this book has been, I could not put this
00:03:44.20 --> 00:03:51.08 book down. And this book is just the picture that it paints of what you all went through in that
00:03:51.08 --> 00:03:58.92 Pacific Campaign is it's unbelievable what you guys went through. It truly is.
00:04:01.96 --> 00:04:09.000 So I guess if we're going to start, I always like to start. I always like to start at the start.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.52 So for you, go into the book here. It says in early 1939, a boy from the next block came home
00:04:16.52 --> 00:04:21.64 from overseas. And I was never the same become because of it. His name was Lee Preston.
00:04:22.36 --> 00:04:26.76 And he was a corporal on leave from the Marine Corps. He showed up wearing his dress blues,
00:04:26.76 --> 00:04:32.92 creating quite a stern or quiet, spoken neighborhood. Mostly I think the stir was in me. He
00:04:32.92 --> 00:04:39.24 looks so sharp in that uniform and his manner the way he carried himself at once modest,
00:04:39.24 --> 00:04:45.16 but utterly selfish. He got me thinking about myself and my future. I was only a couple years
00:04:45.16 --> 00:04:49.96 younger than Lee, but it didn't seem that way. I was a senior in high school just a teenager,
00:04:49.96 --> 00:04:56.84 still a kid and Lee, well, he was different now. He had changed. He had left home a boy and returned.
00:04:56.84 --> 00:05:05.48 I'm a Marine, a warrior. A man. So the old Marine Corps recruiting process of just sending
00:05:05.48 --> 00:05:09.32 Marines home on leave and their dress uniform worked on you, huh? It really did.
00:05:12.12 --> 00:05:15.56 Ed, what did you know about the Marine Corps at that point in time?
00:05:16.76 --> 00:05:23.24 I bring much. I was being approached by one of the old timers in the local Marine Corps
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:31.08 reserved, organized and they were trying to get me to join. This was an opportunity to find a
00:05:31.08 --> 00:05:38.04 little bit from another source. What was going to be? What it was like? I was surprised later on thinking
00:05:38.04 --> 00:05:46.52 about this at that time. The Marine Corps was only 20,000. A lot of people that they felt
00:05:46.52 --> 00:05:56.04 forced them to be able to be selected to get in there actually. This is all in 1939 and long before
00:05:56.04 --> 00:06:02.28 we even thought we were going to get in World War II. It wasn't until, not much longer after I joined
00:06:02.28 --> 00:06:10.68 in 1939, that I went to a couple of weeks, just like the National Guard once a week,
00:06:10.68 --> 00:06:16.92 and have to rail right down right close to where we were having this broadcast right now, right across
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:28.92 the road from us. Then I went to college, Warsaw State University, and had one year, one year of
00:06:28.92 --> 00:06:37.64 college, and went to two encampments with the organizers or one that first one is Sandy Eagle,
00:06:37.64 --> 00:06:47.96 the second one was to Brimerton. Then we got called active duty though in November of 1940.
00:06:48.76 --> 00:06:54.68 That's not very long. It was just a year. That's a year before we got into the war.
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:02.28 Here we were called and went by two up train and we got about 300 of us at least, and ended up
00:07:02.28 --> 00:07:12.20 with Sandy Eagle, and that was that was for an accampment. Then a year later in November 1940,
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:18.44 we were called in active duty. We thought we were going to be gone one year, but we were only
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:25.56 gone what we were going for total of five years. So where were you when Pearl Harbor happened?
00:07:25.56 --> 00:07:30.76 When Pearl Harbor happened, we were in Sandy Eagle, and I was going through a Scott Sniper School,
00:07:30.76 --> 00:07:35.64 and I had a place called Mission Valley. I don't know if you've been to Sandy Eagle lately,
00:07:35.64 --> 00:07:42.12 but Mission Valley is now a mall. Isn't that amazing? That was nothing but a safe Russian
00:07:42.12 --> 00:07:47.16 and a lot of rattlesnakes. So you're going through that Sniper School Pearl Harbor happens,
00:07:48.12 --> 00:07:54.12 and what did they do? They immediately recall you, did they cancel your school? We all had returned
00:07:54.12 --> 00:08:01.96 to the base and we get ready to go here, go there, there was just all kinds of commands going out.
00:08:03.32 --> 00:08:07.72 First of all, hey, what to go here? No, no, we're going to go there and this, all of that.
00:08:07.72 --> 00:08:14.92 And despite of all of that, within one month, well, by first part of January,
00:08:14.92 --> 00:08:23.64 we were board of ship, heading to American Smaller, and to defend that island from the Japanese
00:08:23.64 --> 00:08:31.000 taken over and blocking the supply line from nine states to New Zealand and Australia.
00:08:32.04 --> 00:08:36.28 Now, did the Japanese ever show up? And attack that section of American Samo?
00:08:36.28 --> 00:08:47.96 They didn't for a long time. They would have, if a handman for what's that mean,
00:08:47.96 --> 00:08:53.000 island, and on the other hand, they'd be big battle midway. Midway. Midway. My age and middle
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.24 of the difficult recalling names anymore. It's all good. We got time. So at what point did you get
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.80 the next, the next orders that you are going to not just guard the silent anymore, you guys
00:09:07.80 --> 00:09:15.48 were going to head out? Yeah, about a month before we find a left, we've been training the
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:22.28 Japanese young men who joined the join the Marine Corps reserve. And they took over the
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:30.28 guarding each of the little beaches all around the island, somewhere very remote. And so we're
00:09:30.28 --> 00:09:36.12 able to leave and had no idea where we're going. We thought, well, it could be the East Indies,
00:09:36.12 --> 00:09:43.16 who we had no idea. But on the other hand, we know it pretty much is going to be going to go out of
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:48.76 Kaneal because we were having difficulties there. And somewhere in here, you got your commission
00:09:48.76 --> 00:09:53.80 becoming, and you became an officer. How did that happen? Okay, after we've been on
00:09:53.80 --> 00:10:01.80 small for about three or four months, I was now a corporal at as a squad leader of a machine gun
00:10:02.36 --> 00:10:11.48 like machine gun squad. And I got along very well with the NCOs and with our paternal
00:10:11.48 --> 00:10:20.84 leader. And so I was recommended to go to a machine gun, it was built as a machine gun training
00:10:20.84 --> 00:10:30.12 school. But it turned out it was just to identify likely candidates to become commissioned.
00:10:30.68 --> 00:10:38.20 So I recognize there was probably about, uh, could have been 150 or more of us. And it lasted six
00:10:38.20 --> 00:10:43.88 weeks. And here as a corporal, I was one of those selected to get a field commission.
00:10:44.60 --> 00:10:49.88 And that's it. You had one year of college, they put, put you from corporal to
00:10:50.68 --> 00:10:54.92 second lieutenant. To second lieutenant, and at that time we had no means of even getting
00:10:55.72 --> 00:11:02.92 getting any second Lieutenant bars. It had, it made one down at the, where they were,
00:11:02.92 --> 00:11:09.96 where they're, uh, aircraft were. So you guys just fashioned some, some butter bars for yourself.
00:11:09.96 --> 00:11:16.28 Right, we did. And then, and then next next thing when matter of, and parts first fire, no
00:11:16.28 --> 00:11:22.28 memory, this was only a month after I was commissioned. Uh, here we were bar ship heading to
00:11:22.28 --> 00:11:30.76 Lord knows where and turned out to be Guadalcanale. And here I am entering combat with the same group
00:11:30.76 --> 00:11:37.24 that I had been a list of it before the same company. And I know our first sergeant, he was a
00:11:37.24 --> 00:11:43.88 griffle guy. And he used to read me all like a theater, everybody else. But he saw that any time
00:11:43.88 --> 00:11:48.28 that I was giving a command that he said, you listen to your second lieutenant, you're going
00:11:48.28 --> 00:11:53.40 to have to contend with me. So that was just, it was just wonderful. So I was an extra officer assigned
00:11:53.40 --> 00:12:00.84 to the company headquarters. And that was pretty much the situation they had to have extra officers
00:12:00.84 --> 00:12:06.04 when they got in the casually, they could immediately fill a fill the ranks with, with a new
00:12:06.04 --> 00:12:11.48 pertune commander. And then that's a long story after, right, how I got into the actual
00:12:11.48 --> 00:12:18.52 action of itself. Not knowing how I was going to be able to react as a, as a young lieutenant leader.
00:12:18.52 --> 00:12:23.88 Well, you write about that here. Here, we'll go back to the book and here is you actually
00:12:23.88 --> 00:12:30.92 heading into Guadalcanale. And here we go. I remember thinking as my LCVP chug toward the beach
00:12:30.92 --> 00:12:37.000 that my time had come. And that it would be a time of testing when I would get to show what I was
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.44 made of at last. Even so, a part of me wished I were somewhere else. What if I failed the test?
00:12:44.44 --> 00:12:48.60 Yeah. I was assigned to the headquarters section of B company first battalion as an extra
00:12:48.60 --> 00:12:53.24 second lieutenant with no specific duties other than to follow whatever orders I was given,
00:12:53.24 --> 00:12:58.52 and make myself useful in whatever possible way. The regiment was actually above full strength
00:12:58.52 --> 00:13:02.68 with junior officers to spare. It was an unusual circumstance. And I knew it would suit,
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:07.96 soon change because junior officers typically suffer the highest casualties relative to the other
00:13:07.96 --> 00:13:13.88 ranks. A Trishin would quickly and inevitably take its toll. Lutonants and command of line units
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:21.48 would get killed, wounded, injured, and sick. Extra is like me. Would replace them. Inevitably,
00:13:22.04 --> 00:13:27.64 a few junior officers would be relieved for incompetence or cowardice. I prayed that I wouldn't
00:13:27.64 --> 00:13:32.28 be one of them. That I wouldn't turn yellow and let my buddies down when the going got tough.
00:13:32.28 --> 00:13:40.28 A fate worse than death. As for death itself, no worries there. Getting killed was something
00:13:40.28 --> 00:13:48.12 that happened to the other guy. And then arrival, RLCVP's came to a gentle halt at the waterline,
00:13:48.12 --> 00:13:54.44 nosing into the sand of beach red between the Teneru River and Lunga Point. We climbed over the
00:13:54.44 --> 00:14:00.20 sides. There were no ramps on those early model of Higginboats, and we walked onto Guadalcanal.
00:14:00.68 --> 00:14:05.72 We hardly got our trousers wet. We experienced rougher landings during amphibious assault
00:14:05.72 --> 00:14:15.000 exercises outside San Diego. San Chamenie for one. So you're heading into Guadalcanal and there's
00:14:15.64 --> 00:14:19.64 it's a pretty calm entry even though there had been a lot of fighting going on.
00:14:19.64 --> 00:14:21.88 Yeah, previously they had been at that location.
00:14:23.80 --> 00:14:28.92 So once you get on Guadalcanal, you start to move towards the front lines.
00:14:28.92 --> 00:14:35.40 Yeah, in this case it was off of the opposite direction where the front lines were. The
00:14:35.40 --> 00:14:41.24 Japanese had landed. We waste south of us and there was concern that they were going to come
00:14:41.24 --> 00:14:52.36 in and develop us from that location. So our regiment moved out to Hedomoff and going through
00:14:52.36 --> 00:15:04.36 jungle and at night. We didn't know where we were. We'd finally got up to an army up at
00:15:04.36 --> 00:15:12.60 the 164th from the quotas. They had just ended up shooting each other just the day before.
00:15:13.40 --> 00:15:21.32 Here we saw blood all over the place from that situation. We ended up at night and we just had to
00:15:21.32 --> 00:15:29.24 stop right along a river bank and I had my feet dangling in the water at the time. So anyway,
00:15:30.20 --> 00:15:36.60 we never did with the Japanese. They're all suddenly disappeared from that particular location.
00:15:36.60 --> 00:15:42.68 But that was a try. Quite a try in time. Just what it's like to move into combat. Not
00:15:42.68 --> 00:15:48.52 no one's going to happen next. You know one thing that I talk about a lot is the possibility
00:15:48.52 --> 00:15:54.36 of friendly fire occurring. Yeah, exactly what happened. I know I had friendly fire incidents happen
00:15:54.36 --> 00:16:01.72 with me in Iraq and this happened to you as well. I'm going to the book here. You've been moving
00:16:01.72 --> 00:16:06.76 for a while and you're holding up at night and you guys are in your position then all of a sudden
00:16:06.76 --> 00:16:12.68 bang someone yelled another shot fired. Yeah. And then another and then another several shots and
00:16:12.68 --> 00:16:18.36 quick succession all from our foxholes. More shots all at once and just the whole company shooting,
00:16:18.36 --> 00:16:22.52 firing every which way shooting and shouting grenades with their own bursting left and right,
00:16:22.52 --> 00:16:27.96 front and to my rear explosions and muzzle blasts lift the area like popping flash bolts.
00:16:27.96 --> 00:16:33.16 Corporal Lane was hitting the arm a minor wound but he didn't think that it was minor. He panicked
00:16:33.16 --> 00:16:38.76 and shouted out to Sergeant Wimpy right. Top my my arm shot off. Since right and
00:16:38.76 --> 00:16:43.000 Lane were best buddies. A show of concern from the first sergeant might have might in the circumstances
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.24 have been expected and when certainly have been warranted. But right and old salt, who is
00:16:47.24 --> 00:16:52.28 crusty as they come was not practiced and showing concern even to best buddies who had been wounded
00:16:52.28 --> 00:16:57.000 in combat. Muddering just loud enough to make himself heard above the racket. Right replied,
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.04 shut up you fool. You want to let them know where I am? The shooting continued. More grenades
00:17:02.04 --> 00:17:05.88 exploded. PFC Harold Park, a bargarner with first platoon,
00:17:05.88 --> 00:17:10.92 realized that several men just to his left were throwing grenades all around the darn place. The
00:17:10.92 --> 00:17:16.36 guys were just having a little hang grenade war with each other. Maybe the Japanese were out there
00:17:16.36 --> 00:17:21.56 too tossing a few grenades of their own but parked in think so. He stayed low and didn't fire his weapon.
00:17:21.56 --> 00:17:25.40 I didn't figure would do any good even if they were Japanese. You couldn't see nothing.
00:17:25.40 --> 00:17:33.16 All you could do is park was a half Korean and half I have Irish.
00:17:33.16 --> 00:17:38.76 Yes sir. I had a lot of contact with them after the war as well.
00:17:38.76 --> 00:17:44.76 So it was important for him to because I know you say in the book that that he inherited his
00:17:44.76 --> 00:17:50.28 father's looks not as mothers. So he looked more Korean. We told him he'd better stay close.
00:17:52.28 --> 00:18:01.80 Yeah that's a rough one. So you get done with this. This just happening basically all night.
00:18:01.80 --> 00:18:05.64 I mean crazy fire fights and you don't even know if there's any Japanese.
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:12.04 Well that's time. My Murdoch Murdoch was acting a company commander at that time and
00:18:13.08 --> 00:18:19.72 man near him got shot through the abdomen area and he's more concerned that he lost it
00:18:19.72 --> 00:18:25.40 a lot of his private parts. What are you doing?
00:18:25.40 --> 00:18:30.28 Now was Murdoch? Did Murdoch have experience from some of the other campaigns?
00:18:30.28 --> 00:18:33.64 No he was just like the rest of us. We're all new to combat.
00:18:36.68 --> 00:18:43.96 Speaking of near misses and whatnot, you're waiting to do a link up and here we go back to the book.
00:18:43.96 --> 00:18:47.96 I thought I might grab a quick bite to eat and start to open my sea ration can.
00:18:47.96 --> 00:18:52.52 In the process I somehow managed to cut my thumb to the bone. Blood gust from the wound and I
00:18:52.52 --> 00:18:57.56 spent some frantic moments applying a field dressing to stomp the flow. The noncombs and enlisted men
00:18:57.56 --> 00:19:01.08 watched me probably trying hard not to laugh at me. I still have a scar right there and that's
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:07.64 thumb from that. And they're watching their thinking second lieutenant's are idiots. Hard to
00:19:07.64 --> 00:19:14.76 argue with that assessment which the lower ranks held as virtually at axiomatic. And I just given
00:19:14.76 --> 00:19:19.32 them another reason for their certified how humiliating and annoying the cut would not fully heal as long
00:19:19.32 --> 00:19:24.44 as I remain on Guadalcanal and I still bear a scar from it. Thus far the chief dangers in Guadalcanal
00:19:24.44 --> 00:19:30.52 posed to my well being it come from one my buddies via friendly fire and two myself. The
00:19:30.52 --> 00:19:36.04 Japanese in comparison had been a relatively benign presence. There are a couple of situations right
00:19:36.04 --> 00:19:42.60 at that same time that happened. One was a young marine from another outfit. He was a real bad
00:19:42.60 --> 00:19:48.36 he thought he was he's really good there. He says I'm used to all this stuff. And here he had a
00:19:48.36 --> 00:19:55.16 Japanese skull hanging from a from a court of some sort and he was just swinging that around crazy.
00:19:55.16 --> 00:20:00.44 Then a little bit later within within an hour or so we had a big air rain just hundreds of
00:20:00.44 --> 00:20:08.52 Japanese planes dropped drop bombs on us. And then I was watching one of our an aircraft cruise
00:20:08.52 --> 00:20:15.32 cruiseers shooting at him and many of their planes dropped at that time. But that was that was really
00:20:15.32 --> 00:20:21.16 a really getting into it in deep way but not really directly in direct wire at the time.
00:20:21.16 --> 00:20:27.64 So that time that kid that you talk about and you mentioned in the book this is sort of the
00:20:27.64 --> 00:20:31.40 so he's a guy that had been fighting somewhere else and he comes back and so this is the first
00:20:31.40 --> 00:20:37.40 person that you see that you look at that's starting to be you know he's having some let's see how
00:20:37.40 --> 00:20:43.48 did you put it he had acclimated to conditions on Guadalcanal that's what you wrote and you know
00:20:43.48 --> 00:20:50.44 however long that takes before you know it's a different it's a different it's a different environment
00:20:50.44 --> 00:20:57.48 it's a completely different mindset and that's what he was doing. Now these all these young people
00:20:57.48 --> 00:21:02.92 they all had beers now you know they haven't shaved for a long time and they they had the
00:21:02.92 --> 00:21:08.68 hand hand up food really the reading Japanese rice and whatnot because our transfers all had to
00:21:08.68 --> 00:21:16.68 leave they loaded off the troops but most of the mature all of the food stuff they were able
00:21:16.68 --> 00:21:21.56 to unload so they had eat this Japanese food so anyway they were pretty good looking people
00:21:21.56 --> 00:21:27.24 but even so they were full of they were full of full of fight you could tell young people and
00:21:27.24 --> 00:21:34.28 you know young guys that are in their teens still you know you get into this
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:36.28 uh...
00:21:36.28 --> 00:21:40.04 motton account and i say that right the motton account metan account yeah
00:21:40.04 --> 00:21:45.16 metan account uh... this this river
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:49.88 this offensive that you guys start on ten november which is the hundred sixty seven
00:21:49.88 --> 00:21:53.16 anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps and here we go to the book separating
00:21:53.16 --> 00:21:57.88 our forces from their geographical objective of coastal village with some four miles of
00:21:57.88 --> 00:22:03.24 of exceptionally rugged terrain grassy ridges falling away steeply to jungle choke ravines
00:22:03.24 --> 00:22:07.32 in several thousand japanese infantry men also exceptionally rugged
00:22:07.32 --> 00:22:12.04 our mission objective was to engage defeat and destroy the enemy formations in our path
00:22:12.76 --> 00:22:16.68 our assault units advanced solely but steadily against the term in resistance the eighth
00:22:16.68 --> 00:22:23.000 marines ordered to move up in column behind the two seven filed across a narrow pontoon bridge
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.76 over the motton account metan account and continue to short distance before halting for new
00:22:28.76 --> 00:22:34.76 in child as before the sweep to call the point we encountered no japanese the attacking
00:22:34.76 --> 00:22:38.20 units are driven them off but we suffered casualties just the same
00:22:38.20 --> 00:22:44.04 that's it's been a bit about there we were we had the child uh... there were many japanese
00:22:44.04 --> 00:22:48.44 bodies lying about some had been partially buried some of the eggs are still sticking
00:22:48.44 --> 00:22:53.72 up uh... there been a major battle between between them attacking
00:22:53.72 --> 00:22:57.96 the other rains that have been there just before we were weeks before
00:22:57.96 --> 00:23:02.12 and here all these mung all these bodies and flies and maggots everything was
00:23:02.12 --> 00:23:05.000 so we ate among all of that
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.64 yeah your sense of some some guys would
00:23:07.64 --> 00:23:13.48 could couldn't even carry on barely because it smelled so bad yeah yeah yeah
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:19.08 this right near a place called point crews by the way and today it is a city well
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:25.56 of over twenty thousand that's the capital of the of the cell of solman islands
00:23:25.56 --> 00:23:29.32 at this point you actually say in the book as you were sitting there amongst all these
00:23:29.32 --> 00:23:34.52 bodies these dead bodies and as you're sitting there eating your child
00:23:34.52 --> 00:23:39.32 you say like that kid twirling the skull i was acclimating to the conditions on
00:23:39.32 --> 00:23:44.92 guadal canal i'd been on the island for seven days
00:23:44.92 --> 00:23:47.56 so that's an indication to you
00:23:47.56 --> 00:23:51.24 so then you guys later that day and enemy unit penetrator online and ambush weapons
00:23:51.24 --> 00:23:55.96 patoon killing three marines with a burst of enemy fire with with a burst of machine gun fire
00:23:55.96 --> 00:23:59.80 and then the entire offensive had suddenly been called off
00:23:59.80 --> 00:24:03.48 and not only that we're gonna give up the ground we had taken relinquishing it to the
00:24:03.48 --> 00:24:06.92 japanese what the hell we thought
00:24:06.92 --> 00:24:11.72 so you get told hey you guys stop attacking
00:24:11.72 --> 00:24:14.68 the reason was which you'll get into in this a bit
00:24:14.68 --> 00:24:18.52 is that there's a major task force the japanese
00:24:18.52 --> 00:24:22.36 but twelve transfers full of troops can you imagine
00:24:22.36 --> 00:24:26.68 and uh... battleship and cruisers and lot of destroyers
00:24:26.68 --> 00:24:29.000 and they they were gonna they were gonna just
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.36 knock us off of there
00:24:30.36 --> 00:24:35.96 we had we had we didn't have a good feel that it was that dire but boy it
00:24:35.96 --> 00:24:38.36 turned out it was because that
00:24:38.36 --> 00:24:42.52 and when they did come in at night we saw him come in the mid-no-fammer
00:24:42.52 --> 00:24:47.96 and uh... major battle between the naval battle called the naval battle called al canal
00:24:47.96 --> 00:24:51.80 and uh... you never know watching at night time you didn't know
00:24:51.80 --> 00:24:55.80 who's your our ships and which are theirs all sent you see something blow up
00:24:55.80 --> 00:24:59.80 you see red hot shells being fired going back and criss-crossing fact
00:24:59.80 --> 00:25:02.28 back and forth and then the next
00:25:02.28 --> 00:25:03.72 next morning
00:25:03.72 --> 00:25:07.08 he was they have had troops have the uh...
00:25:07.08 --> 00:25:10.68 some are men that there there's their own ships were sunk
00:25:10.68 --> 00:25:14.12 and now they they're all full of oil and they're
00:25:14.12 --> 00:25:17.32 coming up there could now they're landing on our shore
00:25:17.32 --> 00:25:19.56 it was uh... what and here we used
00:25:19.56 --> 00:25:21.72 watching from a grandstand
00:25:21.72 --> 00:25:24.92 viewpoint on a ridge watching all this happen
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:28.60 and incredible did you did you know that
00:25:28.60 --> 00:25:31.56 this naval battle was about to take place
00:25:31.56 --> 00:25:33.80 didn't know it's gonna be anything like that
00:25:33.80 --> 00:25:35.24 imagine
00:25:35.24 --> 00:25:38.84 roughly twelve transports full of troops
00:25:38.84 --> 00:25:42.36 all but all but three of them were sunk
00:25:42.36 --> 00:25:45.08 and the three that did beech
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:49.000 the troops got off but all their supplies and stuff
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.36 remained on
00:25:50.36 --> 00:25:51.80 and and we have
00:25:51.80 --> 00:25:53.000 our planes
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.52 bomb bomb that and try our church
00:25:56.52 --> 00:25:59.64 so we had those we we had to reckon
00:25:59.64 --> 00:26:03.08 with those troops that came we got off of those transports
00:26:03.08 --> 00:26:05.000 and the next or the next week or so
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.32 your your description of this battle
00:26:07.32 --> 00:26:07.64 yeah
00:26:07.64 --> 00:26:09.08 is
00:26:09.08 --> 00:26:11.08 is crazy to read i'm gonna read it
00:26:11.08 --> 00:26:14.76 the battle between the american and japanese surface fleets began a little before
00:26:14.76 --> 00:26:18.04 zero to two hundred like a suddenly breaking storm of
00:26:18.04 --> 00:26:20.44 cataclysmic size and power
00:26:20.44 --> 00:26:22.76 in the language of naval tacticians
00:26:22.76 --> 00:26:26.04 the coming together of two fleets in sea-large channel
00:26:26.04 --> 00:26:27.88 constituted what is known as a meeting
00:26:27.88 --> 00:26:29.80 engage in engagement
00:26:29.80 --> 00:26:32.84 but collision engagement is a better term
00:26:32.84 --> 00:26:35.40 for describing what happened steaming more
00:26:35.40 --> 00:26:38.36 or less blindly into the channel of fleets ran into each other at
00:26:38.36 --> 00:26:39.40 oblique angles
00:26:39.40 --> 00:26:42.28 their ships quickly became intermingled resulting in
00:26:42.28 --> 00:26:46.20 a close quarters melee that saw the combatants charging
00:26:46.20 --> 00:26:50.12 madly about their big guns flashing and booming hurling red hot
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:53.24 shells and high flaming arcs above the channel
00:26:53.24 --> 00:26:56.44 the thunder of the guns rolled across the black water
00:26:56.44 --> 00:26:59.64 a steady pulsating roar and the molten projectile
00:26:59.64 --> 00:27:03.08 streak leg meteors crisscrossing the skies with fiery
00:27:03.08 --> 00:27:07.96 tails rising and falling and crashing into ships and exploding in massive fireballs
00:27:07.96 --> 00:27:12.12 violent secondary explosions caused by ammunition cooking off in the intense heat
00:27:12.12 --> 00:27:14.92 of the detonating shells rock some of the ships and sent them
00:27:14.92 --> 00:27:16.36 furiously ablaze
00:27:16.36 --> 00:27:18.52 blurning like roman candles
00:27:18.52 --> 00:27:22.84 fountains of fire sparking and shooting flames and blasting big chunks of steel
00:27:22.84 --> 00:27:27.64 in every direction all the while star shells and flares burst high above the
00:27:27.64 --> 00:27:31.64 channel and invaded like dying galaxies as they drifted down at the end of their
00:27:31.64 --> 00:27:34.20 parachutes into the extinguishing water
00:27:34.20 --> 00:27:37.96 the canisters that held the flares periodically flew over our positions
00:27:37.96 --> 00:27:42.28 charging like locomotives search lights probe the dirt lower darkness
00:27:42.28 --> 00:27:46.28 with their long brilliant beams sweeping back and forth above the surface
00:27:46.28 --> 00:27:51.32 by secting fixing on some hapless ship bringing the blazing shells down on it
00:27:51.32 --> 00:27:55.48 streams of tracers from automatic cannons and machine guns
00:27:55.48 --> 00:27:58.12 curved through the middle of the air every now and then an
00:27:58.12 --> 00:28:00.84 airant torpedo slammed into the beach below us
00:28:00.84 --> 00:28:06.52 2500 pounds of explosives blasting a big crater at the waterline
00:28:06.52 --> 00:28:10.12 we watched all this from our foxes on the ridge front row seats to
00:28:10.12 --> 00:28:14.92 a spectacle that john murder john mordocla likened to all the fourth of
00:28:14.92 --> 00:28:18.84 July's I ever saw my life all put together at once
00:28:18.84 --> 00:28:23.72 we were a vocal audience awestruck and profane a ship would explode
00:28:23.72 --> 00:28:27.16 and all up and down the line you'd hear men exclaiming
00:28:27.16 --> 00:28:32.60 cheese a surprise and holy shit and oh my fucking god did you see that
00:28:32.60 --> 00:28:37.08 it was thrilling really you couldn't help but feel that way but i also couldn't
00:28:37.08 --> 00:28:41.24 help at wondering which ships were ours and how we could dis- and how they could
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:44.92 distinguish friend from foe i thought of the many men who were losing their
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:49.40 young lives right before our eyes i felt very fortunate to be in safe in my
00:28:49.40 --> 00:28:56.52 foxhole and i wondered who's winning yeah we had no idea who was winning
00:28:56.52 --> 00:29:03.08 yeah just we just knew that what i we had seen a massive combat
00:29:03.08 --> 00:29:07.000 just incredible and we were at a ring side seat
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.96 now as that's going on obviously you have to realize that if the americans don't
00:29:13.96 --> 00:29:19.40 win this thing yeah that was it you guys are done yeah yeah
00:29:19.40 --> 00:29:24.52 can you imagine a convoy like that that many transports
00:29:24.52 --> 00:29:28.68 they they probably matched our numbers at that time if they had got all gotten
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:33.56 a shore but they didn't yeah
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:40.92 early the next morning be company crossed the river to spearhead the attack by
00:29:40.92 --> 00:29:47.80 another green army battalion the one the first the 182nd along the coastal flat
00:29:47.80 --> 00:29:53.64 toward the base of point crews so you guys you guys took lead yeah we were
00:29:53.64 --> 00:29:58.04 we were spearheading that particular attack you know you talk about you
00:29:58.04 --> 00:30:01.32 you mentioned to win be right a little earlier and that's a heck of a nick name
00:30:01.32 --> 00:30:05.08 then doesn't sound like it's easy for a couple and thought about that true
00:30:05.08 --> 00:30:09.56 but but we talk about you know a lot of times we talk about leadership on this podcast
00:30:09.56 --> 00:30:15.000 and you do a great description of this kind of transition and the relationship that you had
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.56 with wimpy right i think it's worse well this is this is my co-author Steve
00:30:19.56 --> 00:30:26.52 wine gardener tell you he was he's a he's a great you know he got a award for a
00:30:26.52 --> 00:30:31.72 police woman that that escaped the holy cost okay
00:30:31.72 --> 00:30:37.56 call lala story well we can definitely look into that book yeah oh yeah
00:30:37.56 --> 00:30:42.84 here's how he describes your relationship with him wimpy right was the company's first
00:30:42.84 --> 00:30:47.40 sergeant he was a tough old salt shorten stocky late 30s or 40s old enough to be my
00:30:47.40 --> 00:30:51.08 father old enough for that matted matter to be the father of quite a few of the
00:30:51.08 --> 00:30:54.68 loutenates in the regiment he was going on 20 years in the Marine Corps and it's
00:30:54.68 --> 00:30:59.48 served in china nicaragua and Haiti he was no new comber to war no stranger to combat
00:30:59.48 --> 00:31:05.56 he was also in our terms he possessed a commanding voice which he used in a full
00:31:05.56 --> 00:31:11.000 throated bellow when reading off one of his charges when reading off one of his charges
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.88 for doing something stupid on sumo before i was commissioned i had been one of his charges
00:31:15.88 --> 00:31:22.44 and it usually more than once deservedly been on the receiving end of one of his
00:31:22.44 --> 00:31:29.56 herangs but now i outranked him i was at first uncomfortable with our new relationship
00:31:29.56 --> 00:31:33.24 i found it hard to imagine giving orders to a man who not so long ago had been
00:31:33.24 --> 00:31:37.000 shouting in my face and giving me a dressing down the likes of which i'd never
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.28 experienced before and never would again it wasn't that i was afraid of him rather i
00:31:42.28 --> 00:31:46.84 respected him too much and knew him and knew too well that he was a great marine to think that
00:31:46.84 --> 00:31:51.80 i could or should be telling what to do and i thought that he might resent my status
00:31:51.80 --> 00:31:58.36 and just to be cantankerous make things difficult for me i need never worried about right
00:31:58.36 --> 00:32:03.96 a consummate professional he supported me fully and ceseerly sincerely i should have expected
00:32:03.96 --> 00:32:09.000 that after all it was because of his recommendation that i received my commission he looked
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.44 on me as his protege and he wanted me to succeed in part because my success would reflect well on
00:32:14.44 --> 00:32:21.000 him but mainly because he was generally genuinely proud of me also because i was a known quantity
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.52 whom he had personally mentored he much preferred me to be giving orders rather than some 90
00:32:26.52 --> 00:32:30.60 day wonder fresh out of training in the states since he had taught me everything i knew he was
00:32:30.60 --> 00:32:35.32 confident that in combat together we would more or less be thinking along the same lines and
00:32:35.32 --> 00:32:40.44 important connection for a top sergeant to have with his petoon leader nor did he know what he
00:32:40.44 --> 00:32:45.48 broke the slightest in subordination toward me from anyone else in the petoon you obey your lieutenant
00:32:45.48 --> 00:32:50.28 or you'll have to answer to me he growled at my guys and you could be damn sure they did nobody
00:32:50.28 --> 00:32:57.08 wanted to have to answer to right sounds like an outstanding marine i'm pretty soon you're going
00:32:57.08 --> 00:33:04.92 again me getting into a part is my my first encounter of very close calls was losing my life
00:33:09.48 --> 00:33:15.08 on hill 78 second platoon was dealing with a lone sniper who had fired on us from the open
00:33:15.08 --> 00:33:20.36 trees on the coastal flap of below he was high up in one of those trees high enough to place
00:33:20.36 --> 00:33:25.40 my little above the hilltop allowing him to shoot down to us at a shallow angle he pottered us
00:33:25.40 --> 00:33:32.92 pottered us for a better part of four hours and then by the buy and buy and much to my astonishment
00:33:32.92 --> 00:33:37.32 a lieutenant i didn't recognize came strolling along in the ridge fully upright fully exposed
00:33:37.32 --> 00:33:42.60 this sniper smirking at us i was lying on the belly on my belly in the grass and he approached me
00:33:42.60 --> 00:33:47.88 saying i would be worried about that sniper can't hit me one in the next instant a shot rang out
00:33:47.88 --> 00:33:57.64 and a bullet wing disarm can't get complacent uh you continue on i didn't much care where that
00:33:57.64 --> 00:34:01.96 lieutenant won or what happened to him i wanted to get that sniper i pulled out my field glasses
00:34:01.96 --> 00:34:07.16 and scan the trees below our position as luck would have it i spotted the sniper almost at once that
00:34:07.16 --> 00:34:13.000 is i spotted his pude wrapped legs and booted feet dangling from the limb of a huge banyan
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.56 tree about 150 yards from my position i lifted the field glasses a notch to the clump of
00:34:17.56 --> 00:34:23.000 leaves where those above those legs i couldn't see him but he had to be there japanese legs
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.32 were always attached to japanese bodies just then he took a shot at me he must have seen me looking
00:34:29.32 --> 00:34:33.64 maybe my field glasses glinting the sun and give me a way his bullet hit the ground just
00:34:33.64 --> 00:34:39.48 inches from my nose sprang dirt my face i dropped my field glasses and snatched up my spring field
00:34:39.48 --> 00:34:44.12 firing from the prone position i unloaded the entire clip at the clump of leaves above his feet
00:34:44.12 --> 00:34:49.40 five shots one after the other working the bolt quickly put smooth me but smoothly so it's
00:34:49.40 --> 00:34:54.04 not spoiled my aim just as i had been taught to do and just as i had practiced on the Marine
00:34:54.04 --> 00:34:59.000 Coriful ranges i didn't think about it i didn't have to think all that training just kicked right
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.40 in and i killed the man who had been trying to kill me he didn't drop from the tree he didn't
00:35:03.40 --> 00:35:08.36 drop his rifle but that was to be expected japanese snipers customarily tied themselves and the
00:35:08.36 --> 00:35:14.84 rifles to the trees bottom line he didn't shoot at us after that he was dead all right the first man i
00:35:14.84 --> 00:35:24.60 had killed yes that's my first my first call the first call the first call of life having around hit
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:33.32 right front of your face i'm not gonna dirt my face oh he he spotted me i was no longer somebody
00:35:33.32 --> 00:35:43.000 to harass i was somebody it was gonna kill him now we had a dog a dog going on all right
00:35:44.20 --> 00:35:49.64 the eighth Marines first and second battians were to advance by side in columns in tourvine
00:35:49.64 --> 00:35:56.12 then attack and capture hill 83 ridge line the first battalion was to move forward on the right
00:35:56.12 --> 00:35:59.96 be company would lead in the battians advance and my platoon would lead the company's advance
00:35:59.96 --> 00:36:05.24 so that you put you does that put your company right your your company right at the front
00:36:05.24 --> 00:36:08.76 yeah that you're pulled to and right at the front of the company and we were at that time we
00:36:08.76 --> 00:36:14.20 we were right and red in the crux of it following it our an artillery bombardment second
00:36:14.20 --> 00:36:18.44 platoon with the rest of the battalion behind it passed through the army lines and advanced into the
00:36:18.44 --> 00:36:23.16 ravine enemy machine guns and riflemen fired down on us from concealed positions on the ridge
00:36:23.16 --> 00:36:30.60 some 75 yards ahead and above us machine guns chattered rut relentlessly ripping through the jungle
00:36:30.60 --> 00:36:36.68 rustling foliage clipping branches and leaves corporal Olson de Moss and his squad led the way moving
00:36:36.68 --> 00:36:41.80 up out of the ravine and onto the ridge suddenly a voice shouted baker company get off the
00:36:41.80 --> 00:36:47.56 ridge huh i looked around at my man who gave that order most of my men had gone to ground hiding
00:36:47.56 --> 00:36:52.52 in the bush as and were invisible to the Japanese that's the nature of jungle warfare everyone tries
00:36:52.52 --> 00:36:57.24 to stay hidden you can hardly see anyone either enemy or friendly the battlefield seems empty
00:36:57.24 --> 00:37:01.64 and you feel and you can feel alone and isolated on it especially when you're in command especially
00:37:01.64 --> 00:37:05.32 when in the middle of a firefight and when somebody else starts giving orders to your men
00:37:05.32 --> 00:37:09.16 I looked around and a few of the men I could see stared back at me there there are
00:37:09.16 --> 00:37:14.52 ex-blank expressions a firm denial it wasn't me a few minutes later de Moss and his squad
00:37:14.52 --> 00:37:18.76 returned to the ravine having relinquished their brief hold on the ridge top somebody although
00:37:18.76 --> 00:37:24.04 us to get off de Moss explained he thought one of our guys had given the order then we both
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:29.40 realized what had happened those clever Japanese one of them someone flutten American English had given
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:34.68 that order very clever he must be pleased with himself he must be laughing at us just about now
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:41.48 him and his men laughing and how did he know that we were baker company you heard us heard
00:37:41.48 --> 00:37:46.52 us say that that's it now we're going to get a little bit a little bit later than this now I take
00:37:46.52 --> 00:37:52.60 over the puttoon second puttoon they puttoon later was yellow he wouldn't he wouldn't get
00:37:52.60 --> 00:37:58.84 up out of his hole so now I'm in charge and you're going to get into what the close calls I had
00:37:58.84 --> 00:38:04.84 there are boy they were they were mighty close unbelievable I don't know how I survived it
00:38:07.80 --> 00:38:11.96 yeah going back to this we risen to our uphill attack and we were met with more devastating
00:38:11.96 --> 00:38:17.56 machine gun and rifle fire so would you say this this engagement right here is the first time
00:38:17.56 --> 00:38:25.40 that you were under real oh yeah okay yeah other than getting bombed other than having
00:38:25.40 --> 00:38:31.40 area of attack other than it's not for shooting this this was it this is it is about a closest
00:38:31.40 --> 00:38:37.16 close to a call in second be I tell you we kept going for going forward firing on the move leaning
00:38:37.16 --> 00:38:41.08 slightly into the incline shooting from the shoulder and hip firing blindly at the top of the ridge
00:38:41.08 --> 00:38:44.84 we couldn't see the enemy but we knew he was up there dimos on my left banged away with his
00:38:44.84 --> 00:38:49.48 springfield just as fast as he could work the bolt and that his rifle seeves seized up dimos
00:38:49.48 --> 00:38:53.88 looked at me and I looked at him and the spell was broken just like just that fast I came out
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:59.88 of my battle trance I felt very exposed and insecure judging by the wide eyed look he gave me
00:38:59.88 --> 00:39:05.16 dimos felt the same dimos inspectors rifle discovered that he had a bullet had pierced his magazine
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:11.56 barely missing the nose his nose in the process he never cursed never uttered profanities and now
00:39:11.56 --> 00:39:16.76 true to form his big eyes still as saucers his eyes still as big as saucers he exclaimed
00:39:16.76 --> 00:39:21.96 well I'll be a dirty name then he discarded his rifle and started throwing grenades at the top of the
00:39:21.96 --> 00:39:28.60 ridge the reality of our sudden harrowing plight then struck me this was my first major combat
00:39:28.60 --> 00:39:34.04 test as a platoon leader and I realized that I had to take immediate and firm control of myself
00:39:34.04 --> 00:39:39.56 I could not show fear in front of my men a couple feet to my right private McCoy Reynolds had
00:39:39.56 --> 00:39:44.20 been hurling grenades one after the other each time courageously standing up and exposing himself
00:39:44.20 --> 00:39:49.08 to enemy fire he crouched down next to me and scanned the top of the ridge then he exclaimed I see
00:39:49.08 --> 00:39:55.000 them and threw another grenade in the next instant he was shot through the neck killed instantly
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.60 he fell at my feet for a moment I just looked at him his eyes wide open lifeless stared back at me
00:40:00.60 --> 00:40:05.24 then I realized that now more than ever I had to get a grip on things and seize control
00:40:05.24 --> 00:40:11.64 of what was becoming an increasingly chaotic situation I decided at once we needed support from our
00:40:11.64 --> 00:40:17.64 mortars and backed a little way down the ridge out of the field of fire to further assess the situation
00:40:22.12 --> 00:40:28.44 now at the same time we were running low on an ammunition as well and we sent back call we need
00:40:28.44 --> 00:40:33.24 more ammunition next thing we know bandaliar after bandaliar of ammunition started arriving
00:40:34.04 --> 00:40:40.92 just the same as same Guided guys now that's an interesting I mean you recognized
00:40:41.72 --> 00:40:46.76 that that you needed to get control of your emotions
00:40:48.60 --> 00:40:53.80 is that something you would thought about what made you realize that what made you realize oh wow
00:40:53.80 --> 00:40:59.24 I better do something because I'm in charge and I need to make some decisions here I don't I don't
00:40:59.24 --> 00:41:04.44 know all of a sudden fear went away I guess I didn't have fear right at that time
00:41:06.44 --> 00:41:11.96 and it's also interesting but I saw the dire situation here we were in a situation that
00:41:12.52 --> 00:41:21.08 we we had we we were committed and either to keep going or are we gonna back up then back off
00:41:21.08 --> 00:41:26.04 finally we were called back down and now knowing that that that's the same kind of movement
00:41:26.04 --> 00:41:33.56 went clear to the top and decided to just call off that drive in general here I was at the
00:41:33.56 --> 00:41:40.60 I was at the spares head right there it was called off and they just said that the general
00:41:40.60 --> 00:41:48.28 from the top on down was that okay we stopped going after him and losing troops and that's just
00:41:48.28 --> 00:41:55.40 let him try in the vine well yeah because at this point you had we controlled we controlled
00:41:55.40 --> 00:42:00.60 all the ways we controlled this up we had taken out their supplies so let's do some siege warfare
00:42:00.60 --> 00:42:07.96 and make them wait yeah make them star so wait we had no more fighting we had a firm
00:42:09.08 --> 00:42:16.76 the fans line along a ridge for a month just just held a line continue with these setting up
00:42:16.76 --> 00:42:21.32 reconnaissance patrols next year you know are they doing what they were doing and I led
00:42:21.32 --> 00:42:27.32 Denver reconnaissance patrol myself taking out four or five men with me and finding out where they were
00:42:27.32 --> 00:42:33.32 that was scary situation to all these reconnaissance patrols you know right before they before they
00:42:33.32 --> 00:42:38.60 stopped that as you're still pushing forward up that ridge you got some great detail in here that's
00:42:38.60 --> 00:42:44.20 absolutely worth talking about going to the book here the ammunition was quickly distributed so
00:42:44.20 --> 00:42:48.68 you called for ammunition the ammunition was quickly distributed and once again we moved up hill
00:42:48.68 --> 00:42:55.72 shooting as we went another of my man men private Walter Cuss was favorally hit while scouting up the
00:42:55.72 --> 00:43:00.84 ridge from a different direction at the moment of his death he exailed the his last breath
00:43:00.84 --> 00:43:06.44 and that out a long rising how of pain and anguish like a dying animal yeah didn't sound like
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:11.88 human being several attempts were made to reach him and dragon back all on successful
00:43:11.88 --> 00:43:18.68 PFC James Bell said I'm going up there all bring him down he was often running before anyone could
00:43:18.68 --> 00:43:24.44 stop him yeah on his own he did that and he was shot through the chest well before reaching Cuss's body
00:43:25.40 --> 00:43:30.60 we were able to retrieve Bell and he was still alive as we cared him down and out of a line of fire
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:36.44 but he was just about gone he had a sucking chest wound that made it increasingly difficult to breathe
00:43:36.44 --> 00:43:38.60 hoping about size he couldn't breathe you see
00:43:38.60 --> 00:43:43.80 this was the first time I had seen such a wound and it was a terrible sight our corpsman tried
00:43:43.80 --> 00:43:48.12 to patch him up but there was little he could do a sucking chest wound needs to be sealed internally
00:43:48.12 --> 00:43:54.36 as well as externally and the corpsman could only treat the outside finally Bell said it looks like
00:43:54.36 --> 00:44:01.72 this is goodbye and then he calmly died just like in the movies I thought with his last words and
00:44:01.72 --> 00:44:08.28 everything yeah soon after that we quit attacking and withdrew we couldn't dislodge the enemy from the
00:44:08.28 --> 00:44:16.52 ridge we had been defeated our losses were heavy my Patuna loan suffered seven casualties four
00:44:16.52 --> 00:44:25.24 killed Reynolds Bell Cuss and private Robert Cuss three wounded PFC James Harris
00:44:25.24 --> 00:44:31.64 private burnt Mick Bernie and private named Mandraville total casualties for first
00:44:31.64 --> 00:44:36.92 Patallian were nine killed and 23 wounded overall in the period spanning 18 to 23
00:44:36.92 --> 00:44:48.20 November the 8th Marines lost 42 men killed and many more wounded now do I you got in the
00:44:48.20 --> 00:44:55.24 part where a discurory escort was named after Mickoy Reynolds oh I did not know that well let me tell
00:44:55.24 --> 00:45:03.48 you about that yeah my company commander had been a journalist with a with a anorland's paper
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:09.32 so he's good at writing up things so I recommended recommended something written up on him he wrote
00:45:09.32 --> 00:45:15.32 this up in such a matter that a destroyer escort was named after him that's called in McOed Reynolds
00:45:15.32 --> 00:45:25.24 and it in turn sank to Japanese submarines later on yeah and was that um was that captain LeBlanc
00:45:25.24 --> 00:45:31.64 that you're talking about yes it is so so captain LeBlanc was your company commander at that time
00:45:31.64 --> 00:45:38.04 and it sounds like it sounds like from the book well let me give you your your thoughts on him
00:45:38.04 --> 00:45:42.44 we called him little Napoleon he was notoriously eager to make a name for himself and just as
00:45:42.44 --> 00:45:49.000 notorious not just as notoriously a verse to taking risks his men took the risks and he took the
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.88 credit for their success he would say come on we've got a tough job to do and then he decides
00:45:53.88 --> 00:45:57.96 someone else to do it sometimes he denounced that we were going on an out on a reconnaissance
00:45:57.96 --> 00:46:02.28 platoon and then he turned a Murdoch or me or one of the other junior officers and say hey how about
00:46:02.28 --> 00:46:11.96 you leading it and at one point he tells you to go back to the go back to the army this is
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:17.32 a secret is darn thing you can imagine you're reading now he he's telling you to go back to the
00:46:17.32 --> 00:46:23.48 army and tell them what you know what the ethical proposition and they ran into the same
00:46:23.48 --> 00:46:29.72 stuff that we did or and they really ran into it really bad so he tells you to go and this is
00:46:29.72 --> 00:46:34.20 what you this is what you write I come all across the ridges east facing slope walking in the
00:46:34.20 --> 00:46:38.28 grass at the edge of the jungle I was beneath the crests and felt reasonably safe the area was
00:46:38.28 --> 00:46:44.36 deserted a true nomans land I found this very disconserting it was eerie so you're alone
00:46:44.36 --> 00:46:51.64 I'm stupid stupid then I came upon the body of an American soldier he lay slightly above me
00:46:51.64 --> 00:46:56.76 and to my right a stride a narrow trail leading to the top rich his abdomen had been torn open
00:46:56.76 --> 00:47:01.72 and his intestines had spilled out and were spread across the ground a grizzly and heart-rending
00:47:01.72 --> 00:47:10.20 sight I heard past him thinking I wonder what his dreams were will that happen to me now he was
00:47:10.20 --> 00:47:16.68 looking at a photograph do you talk about that there no okay he's now he the last thing
00:47:16.68 --> 00:47:22.84 for a died he's looking at a photograph of his family or his girlfriend is laid out there that's
00:47:22.84 --> 00:47:31.96 the last the last as dying as he's dying he was looking at that and you're thinking I wonder what
00:47:31.96 --> 00:47:36.36 his next would have been me that could be me will that happen to me well that happened yet because
00:47:36.36 --> 00:47:43.24 there's you still have a lot of danger here there's still snipers out there shooting at me at this time
00:47:44.92 --> 00:47:50.04 and now you go I arrived at the army cp to find it in turmoil and anxious captain and is
00:47:50.04 --> 00:47:55.88 visibly agitated staff stood around a field radio listening to a report from the front line emanating
00:47:55.88 --> 00:48:00.76 from the speaker where the sounds of battle mix with the crackling of static a frightened voice crying
00:48:00.76 --> 00:48:06.92 out we're taking a lot of fire put two liter hit leg blown off get us out of here
00:48:08.28 --> 00:48:13.24 I could hear the actual sounds of the battle outside not too far away machine guns rifle fire
00:48:13.24 --> 00:48:18.04 grenades mortars the usual mayhem I reported to the commanding officer and told him what I knew
00:48:18.04 --> 00:48:25.16 and I left the cp laid out close by where's many as a dozen bodies covered with ponchos I
00:48:25.16 --> 00:48:28.92 hurried on instead of staying low on the slope I headed over toward the top of the ridge I don't
00:48:28.92 --> 00:48:33.96 he was interested in hearing me he's already in a so darn deep he didn't care about any more
00:48:33.96 --> 00:48:40.28 detail see he knew he was in a over his hand yeah it's old information met this point yeah
00:48:43.32 --> 00:48:47.40 when I reached the top of the ridge I snuck my head I stuck my head over the crest in the next
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:51.48 incident Japanese machine gun cut loose at me with a long burst sending a streamable
00:48:51.48 --> 00:48:56.60 it's snapping just inches above the head that brought me to my senses and I ran down the slope
00:48:56.60 --> 00:49:01.96 into the jungle I stood there for a minute grap gasping for breath shaking and thinking holy smokes
00:49:01.96 --> 00:49:05.16 almost bought the farm on that one holy smokes
00:49:05.16 --> 00:49:17.96 that count is one of your close calls micro close yeah yeah that's what I'm now you've already
00:49:17.96 --> 00:49:26.04 covered two of them now two out of eight there's actually there's there's three more on Guadalcanale
00:49:26.04 --> 00:49:31.24 that you'll get to in a subiet well what do they say a cat has nine lives so luckily we only have
00:49:31.24 --> 00:49:39.000 eight to cover otherwise the ninth one we wouldn't be here since it's here talking on November 25th
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.000 we were pulled off the line in sent to positions near in the rear near Hendersonfield for the next
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.12 15 days we slept in open sighted tents on the grove of coconut palms on ground that was
00:49:50.12 --> 00:49:55.48 saw from frequent heavy rain showers there was always a possibility that Japanese warships
00:49:55.48 --> 00:50:01.64 would foray and to see large channel during the night and throw a few hundred large cowlblows shells
00:50:02.28 --> 00:50:06.92 into our soggy environments but these dangers were negligible compared to what we had recently
00:50:06.92 --> 00:50:10.92 been through on the front line and we did not worry about them actually we did not worry about
00:50:10.92 --> 00:50:16.76 much of anything we were emotionally and physically drained and lacked both energy and inclination
00:50:16.76 --> 00:50:22.76 to worry we mostly sat around doing nothing partly because we had nothing much to do but also
00:50:22.76 --> 00:50:28.44 because we were sort of in a days you might say we were numb it was not it was not an unpleasant
00:50:28.44 --> 00:50:33.64 state we were purely glad to be alive and the fact that no one was shooting at us at least not
00:50:33.64 --> 00:50:39.88 directly or intentionally made us feel downright you fork we were living for the moment and for the moment
00:50:39.88 --> 00:50:46.12 everything was fine and we were content see now we're coming down with malaria as well you see
00:50:46.12 --> 00:50:52.84 now the other thing you go into here which is interesting is during this period of number
00:50:52.84 --> 00:50:58.04 Marines took steps to upgrade their personal armament the main object of their desire was the
00:50:58.04 --> 00:51:04.92 superb M1 grand semi-automatic rifle that had been issued to the army this still had the old ones
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:11.16 the model 1903 springfield we carried was a fine weapon but it was obsolete the old salts loved
00:51:11.16 --> 00:51:16.92 the O3 like a Viking loves his broad sword but the kids were unsend metal about the rifle because
00:51:16.92 --> 00:51:23.000 they had no history with it so you say while some Marines acquired their M1s through honest
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.04 scrounging in battlefield scavenging others resorted to outright theft and you go through some
00:51:30.04 --> 00:51:36.20 methods that that were used to do that who is also moonlighting you guys had Tommy Guns
00:51:36.20 --> 00:51:42.44 which you said weren't really all that great for most of the purposes the rising
00:51:42.44 --> 00:51:53.16 you know for a while we even had shotgun you know yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:59.32 at Japanese beginning the beginning using the flame source as well is there too at that time
00:51:59.32 --> 00:52:09.24 rough weapon right there oh yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November a Japanese task force
00:52:09.24 --> 00:52:13.40 steamed in the sea large channel of bringing food to the Belieger Japanese forces on Guadalcanal
00:52:13.40 --> 00:52:18.52 our warships sailed forth to intercept it meeting the enemy fleet in that off-to-speweded gap
00:52:18.52 --> 00:52:23.72 between savvoiled and Guadalcanal just off Tassa Farango how do you say that it's right
00:52:23.72 --> 00:52:29.40 Tassa Farango point because our Bivolac was situated inland on low ground I heard the battle but
00:52:29.40 --> 00:52:35.40 did not see it our fleet took an awful beating one of our heavy cruisers the North Hampton was
00:52:35.40 --> 00:52:41.16 struck by two torpedoes within a matter of seconds consumed by fire she sank a few hours later
00:52:41.16 --> 00:52:47.96 you're still sure the heavy crew cruisers Minneapolis Minneapolis New Orleans and Pensacola
00:52:47.96 --> 00:52:52.84 were severely damaged and the sailors were coming off off of an off cover with oil
00:52:52.84 --> 00:52:57.000 and so would they swim into shore some did probably did it was right near the shore
00:52:58.20 --> 00:53:05.40 yeah the battle had been a clear tactical victory for the Japanese but a strategic defeat
00:53:05.40 --> 00:53:10.20 the task force had failed with its primary mission to deliver food to the Japanese army on Guadalcanal
00:53:11.40 --> 00:53:17.24 this was a calamitous development for the Japanese even before the battle their food stocks were
00:53:17.24 --> 00:53:23.08 desperately not low now they began falling below substance levels the entire enemy army was
00:53:23.08 --> 00:53:27.08 growing physically weaker because the soldiers simply didn't have enough to eat
00:53:29.16 --> 00:53:33.48 we were in better shape than the Japanese overall but only in a relative sense the first marine
00:53:33.48 --> 00:53:40.76 division in particular was greatly reduced by illness and sheer exhaustion as well as by battle casualties
00:53:40.76 --> 00:53:46.36 it had suffered in four months of fighting yeah a large number of its men were unfit for duty
00:53:46.36 --> 00:53:50.60 and many more were only marginally capable of rendering effective frontline service the
00:53:50.60 --> 00:53:54.60 high command recognizing that the entire division had just about reached the end of its
00:53:54.60 --> 00:53:59.32 operation utility pulled it off the front lines began sending it units to Australia starting on nine
00:53:59.32 --> 00:54:07.88 December yeah so they after my birthday December it's so you wave goodbye to those guys as they're
00:54:07.88 --> 00:54:14.84 leaving and meanwhile on 11 December the 8th marine's resume returned to the ridges yeah right
00:54:14.84 --> 00:54:19.48 but we didn't really take off until first part of the January I guess and the final drive
00:54:20.60 --> 00:54:25.64 and then so it's you on one set of ridges and the Japanese were on the other side they were usually
00:54:25.64 --> 00:54:31.72 somewhere right on the first slope in front of us they were dug in like gulfers like gulfer holes
00:54:32.92 --> 00:54:39.16 but most are more further back on the next over the next next ridge so there'd be you on one
00:54:39.16 --> 00:54:47.000 day they would come up close no so hang on a zed us heard so hang on a zed each other all right
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.60 these dispositions meaning these two ridges that you guys had occupied both ours and those
00:54:52.60 --> 00:54:59.000 the enemy remained substantially unchanged for the next 34 days yeah the brass anxious to void
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.72 a repeat performance of the november battles in order to temporary halt to large scale offensive
00:55:03.72 --> 00:55:08.52 operations instead we were told to hold the line and harass the enemy with aggressive patrols and
00:55:08.52 --> 00:55:15.24 raids in the meantime our air and naval forces would strive to introduce the Tokyo Express which is
00:55:15.24 --> 00:55:22.68 their supply chain now while we were at that location there was a sergeant from the Jason company
00:55:23.56 --> 00:55:29.08 and he had a tummy gun and he didn't enough at enough action going on where he was
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:33.56 steady was coming down the line where there's air reaction he wanted to get into it well he came
00:55:33.56 --> 00:55:40.44 he came right by where I was and no one in two months when great was right shortly after that one
00:55:40.44 --> 00:55:48.92 of our one of our rounds dropped in short he lost two legs in an arm and he was in there's
00:55:48.92 --> 00:55:53.80 an article in the said reading post about it and saying that at least I have the right arm to
00:55:53.80 --> 00:55:59.64 wrap the bar with for a drink I'll tell about it and there's some too
00:55:59.64 --> 00:56:07.40 words uh you guys that during this you also talk about the fact that you would be young
00:56:07.40 --> 00:56:13.000 stuff back and forth to the Japanese they're a little bit a little bit they'd be yelling at you
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.80 guys and you'd yell back at them and it sounds like during the daytime well you say it was during
00:56:17.80 --> 00:56:24.36 the daytime was a policy became one of live and let live during the day of a much different policy
00:56:24.36 --> 00:56:29.24 ruled at night after the case yeah and they were sneaking in on the server now and then make a little
00:56:30.52 --> 00:56:36.92 trying to sneak in and maybe get one of our guys in a fox hole yeah you're going to one of those
00:56:36.92 --> 00:56:41.96 one night during a heavy downport of Japanese crept up from the ravines the sound of their movement
00:56:41.96 --> 00:56:47.16 mass by the falling rain and jump the crew a ferocious hand-a-hand struggle ensued I heard our
00:56:47.16 --> 00:56:53.72 men yelling help oh god they're in our whole help help they're blood curling cries and thrashing sounds
00:56:53.72 --> 00:56:57.88 were plainly audible to everyone in the vicinity there were on a point little bit a little bit
00:56:57.88 --> 00:57:03.64 a head of our regular line and this has gotta be just this is on a mental weedless and
00:57:03.64 --> 00:57:08.28 horrified but stayed in our holes that's how bad it was to get out of your holes you don't dare
00:57:08.28 --> 00:57:17.08 because you you anybody outside the holes enemy suddenly the yelling sounds of the fighting
00:57:17.08 --> 00:57:20.92 ceased we actually waited and listened to pairing through the rain and into the darkness
00:57:20.92 --> 00:57:24.36 then the Japanese begin probing our position all up and down the line running up to the
00:57:24.36 --> 00:57:28.84 crest and chucking a few grenades over the top at our holes and running back down hill after
00:57:28.84 --> 00:57:33.000 the grenades exploded usually harmlessly our guys would leap from their holes dashed to the
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.92 crest and throw grenades at the fleeting enemy then they'd scamper back to their holes and the
00:57:36.92 --> 00:57:40.76 Japanese would return to herle their grenades back and forth and went through the night intervals
00:57:40.76 --> 00:57:45.48 of silence and then flash bang of grenades exploding and men hollering and cursing in the English and
00:57:45.48 --> 00:57:50.28 Japanese the next morning we discovered that one of them men in the machine gun post had been killed
00:57:50.28 --> 00:57:54.84 that's that day and headed to death the others have been wounded but somehow they'd beaten back
00:57:54.84 --> 00:58:03.16 their attackers and you were saying this earlier you we also conducted aggressive patrols
00:58:03.16 --> 00:58:07.96 and probe their lines at giving as good as we got or maybe even better if more frontline
00:58:07.96 --> 00:58:12.12 Japanese soldiers had survived the war maybe be reading memoirs by those veterans of
00:58:12.12 --> 00:58:17.56 Guadalcanal campaign recounting how the US Marines terrorized them at night and terrorized
00:58:17.56 --> 00:58:23.000 them we most certainly did some guys really enjoyed this part of the job teenagers who found
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.40 their true nature in the jungle who discovered that they were born for the warrior life
00:58:27.40 --> 00:58:32.92 there were very there were a few in every unit more than a few actually more than you might expect
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:37.96 more than I expected they went after the Japanese with a competence and enthusiasm that made
00:58:37.96 --> 00:58:42.68 them almost as frightening to their officers as they must have been to their enemies it was just
00:58:42.68 --> 00:58:48.12 amazing observed Murdoch how you could take kids like these and put them out into the jungle
00:58:48.12 --> 00:58:52.76 and in just a few weeks they'd be great at jungle warfare for them it was like playing cowboys and
00:58:52.76 --> 00:58:57.08 Indians they'd come back from a patrol and you'd hear them talk how many teeth did you get
00:58:57.08 --> 00:59:05.88 or how many did you kill and they'd brag while I killed three or four now I wanted these patrols
00:59:06.52 --> 00:59:10.84 much earlier than what we're talking about right now I was leading this patrol and had four
00:59:10.84 --> 00:59:18.84 five others with me and we ended up we were in a location where the army had now passed through
00:59:18.84 --> 00:59:27.16 our lines and they were in control so we came right by the reddish metal regimental CP and the
00:59:27.16 --> 00:59:31.72 army colonel says what do you guys doing here said well we got it with constant patrols as
00:59:31.72 --> 00:59:40.76 well we're in charge here now we don't need you any more and so we said so the we moved
00:59:40.76 --> 00:59:47.16 on for a little bit further back to our own line where we were in reserve and it turned out
00:59:47.16 --> 00:59:51.80 we had a little bit higher than we was so he'd look up at us and we were on the skyline from
00:59:51.80 --> 00:59:56.76 his from his perspective very skyline and then we would at peace of well you're going to track
00:59:56.76 --> 01:00:04.20 fire being up there well here's parsley crack but not entirely well anyway as we as we
01:00:04.20 --> 01:00:12.36 left my man says say they're they're two or three snipers in a tree right over there C.P.
01:00:12.36 --> 01:00:18.44 what should we do I said shoot them so we shot them killed them and and told the Colonel
01:00:18.44 --> 01:00:21.96 he just shot three snipers right over here C.P.
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:32.68 and later on later on I'm and we return in 1982 there's a there's a big Catholic church right
01:00:32.68 --> 01:00:40.52 there now and I talked to the to the not a priest when next went up who's there and I
01:00:40.52 --> 01:00:49.16 tell him about it and then that same later on that same day well he so he he's the one
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:56.20 as a young as a young priest he's the one that rescued Joel Foss when he got shut down
01:00:56.76 --> 01:01:00.04 I've gotten the water and he's all tangled up in his fairs who've never been out
01:01:00.04 --> 01:01:07.24 to tell him about it well later on that day we saw we saw Joel Foss and then in here he met
01:01:07.24 --> 01:01:16.60 he met this priest you know and he was talking about it and so anyway what's interesting is that
01:01:17.64 --> 01:01:24.60 when they told us this army Colonel what we had just done the Colonel was still unhappy with us
01:01:24.60 --> 01:01:33.08 and and and at the same reunion when we saw Joel Foss and all there was there was a
01:01:34.36 --> 01:01:41.64 veteran army who had previously had been a Marine in China and he joined the National Guard
01:01:41.64 --> 01:01:46.52 and that's where he was out there this time and he came to me he says you know
01:01:46.52 --> 01:01:55.56 I just heard you talking I was there and you had a beard like Santa Claus and it says you were there yeah
01:01:56.12 --> 01:02:00.76 and that says after you left I told the Colonel says you know after all we're on the same side
01:02:03.08 --> 01:02:10.92 a small world yeah that's crazy after all these years you know we talked a little bit about
01:02:10.92 --> 01:02:20.76 about Murdoch and and he's quite the character and you talk about him a little bit here
01:02:22.68 --> 01:02:29.56 because captain what happened to Captain of the block you get somehow somehow Murdoch ends up taking over
01:02:30.76 --> 01:02:36.04 eventually the block was relieved and replaced by Murdoch who's an ideal a Boston Irishman
01:02:36.04 --> 01:02:43.40 Murdoch was very funny and very tough a superb combat a superb combat commander and a bit wild too
01:02:43.40 --> 01:02:48.68 all traits that is younger charges greatly appreciated one manifestation of his toughness apart from his
01:02:48.68 --> 01:02:54.20 courage and coolness under fire was his disdain for metals and combinations very few men who had
01:02:54.20 --> 01:03:01.40 him as their CEO including me received decorations Murdoch explained I didn't recommend many people
01:03:01.40 --> 01:03:05.08 I didn't care if a machine gunner killed 50 men that's what he was supposed to do that's what he's
01:03:05.08 --> 01:03:10.20 getting paid for that was my attitude once in Hawaii we had a big for the formation with the
01:03:10.20 --> 01:03:16.44 division and they decorated all these guys one company would give 40 metals out I'd give one my attitude
01:03:16.44 --> 01:03:26.52 was hey killing japs is our job we're not doing it for metals yeah and here here you start to talk
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:34.36 about just the whole just the the brutality of what's going on over there one of the themes
01:03:34.36 --> 01:03:39.48 running through the preceding anecdotes is the merciless nature of the Pacific war the Marine
01:03:39.48 --> 01:03:44.68 court had tried to prepare us for this in our training bayonet drills were especially important
01:03:44.68 --> 01:03:51.96 in reality in combat there to be aggressive you see right right yeah in reality in combat there are
01:03:51.96 --> 01:03:57.48 few instances when men used bayonets in the traditional manner fixed to the rifles bayonet drills
01:03:57.48 --> 01:04:03.40 were performed for their psychological effect so that men would learn the psychology of the bayonet
01:04:03.40 --> 01:04:09.72 namely to kill brutally quickly and unthinkingly without compunction or moral qualms so
01:04:09.72 --> 01:04:15.80 done realistic as far as the application right but our training merely paved the way for our
01:04:15.80 --> 01:04:23.08 transformation into hardened killers exposure to actual combat accomplished and completed the
01:04:23.08 --> 01:04:30.52 process you got hard or you died it was that simple killer be a killer be killed you know
01:04:30.52 --> 01:04:37.32 and the Japanese made it simple they were they were notoriously unspearing their reputation
01:04:37.32 --> 01:04:43.40 for ruthlessness and savagery was widespread and well-founded we knew all the stories the rape of
01:04:43.40 --> 01:04:49.40 Nand King the Badan death marks atrocities committed far and wide and often against prisoners
01:04:49.40 --> 01:04:54.60 we believed correctly that we could expect no pity if we fell into their hands they neither
01:04:54.60 --> 01:05:00.84 asked for quarter nor gave any and we responded in kind if they had set rules as we believed
01:05:00.84 --> 01:05:06.20 we were damn sure going to play by them one other choice do we have they simply would not
01:05:06.20 --> 01:05:11.08 surrender they would not stop coming out us until we killed them very quickly we learned that
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:16.68 trying to take prisoners was a waste of time and dangerous even the wounded if we went to treat them
01:05:16.68 --> 01:05:21.24 would try and kill us by usually by blowing up everyone themselves and the corpsmen who had
01:05:21.24 --> 01:05:26.52 stopped to help them with a grenade the dead had a nasty habit of rising up from the ground
01:05:26.52 --> 01:05:33.16 and attacking us so we made sure the dead were truly dead no sense in taking chances this killer
01:05:33.16 --> 01:05:39.24 be killed approach to war was as brutalizing as it was brutal and affected everyone to some degree
01:05:39.96 --> 01:05:44.60 Murdock recalled a corpsman who came up to me and said hey lieutenant I've got well I've got
01:05:44.60 --> 01:05:48.84 a live one can I shoot him I said sure go ahead corpsman won't want to want to
01:05:48.84 --> 01:05:53.48 expose to have weapons and we shouldn't have shot that wounded guy but I let him do it
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:58.76 we all we all did it all the time because if we took a prisoner it would take two men at least
01:05:58.76 --> 01:06:03.32 to send him back to the rear and we were so thin our lines were really thin because we had a lot of
01:06:03.32 --> 01:06:10.60 guy's sick our units were very much depleted thus we became inert to the horrors of war and not
01:06:10.60 --> 01:06:17.72 surprisingly we did horrible things not without reason when your enemy behaves in a beastial fashion
01:06:17.72 --> 01:06:24.76 it is only natural to look on them as beasts natural and to some extent justify or they consider
01:06:24.76 --> 01:06:34.36 his animals really but we were not without sin in this regard far from it Murdock for example
01:06:34.36 --> 01:06:40.44 never took any prisoners and here's Murdock I wasn't nice I did bad things looking back over the
01:06:40.44 --> 01:06:44.84 years I can say we probably committed as many atrocities against the dead bodies of the Japanese
01:06:44.84 --> 01:06:53.08 as they did to ours pulling teeth for example goal for example we'd heard japs wanted to die looking
01:06:53.08 --> 01:06:57.16 at the sun so we'd rolled them over and stick their faces in the dirt so we couldn't so they
01:06:57.16 --> 01:07:01.64 couldn't see the sun our guys would cut off fingers and make fobs which believe are not with
01:07:01.64 --> 01:07:07.000 the finger of the japs finger hanging down and they'd go out there with the knives and pliers
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.16 trying to pull out gold teeth but if some of us truly relished but if some of them men truly relished
01:07:15.16 --> 01:07:21.96 battle embraced and enjoyed it enjoyed the killing the brutality the horror all of it it is important
01:07:21.96 --> 01:07:29.08 to establish that on the continuum of brutal human behavior the rest of us were not all that far
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:35.08 removed from them and we tended to move closer as the war went on some manner more capable than
01:07:35.08 --> 01:07:42.12 others when it comes to killing but all men are capable one way we improved on this capability
01:07:42.12 --> 01:07:48.20 such improvement being vital to our effectiveness as Marines not to mention our very survival
01:07:48.20 --> 01:07:53.56 was to look on our enemy as hateful creatures less than human from a psychological standpoint
01:07:53.56 --> 01:07:58.52 it became easy to kill them we were killing animals not men and after killing them we would look
01:07:58.52 --> 01:08:05.56 upon their dead bodies and feel nothing no remorse no guilt no horror pity or whatever from there
01:08:05.56 --> 01:08:12.04 it was just a small step to place in the geography of the mind we were pulling gold teeth out
01:08:12.04 --> 01:08:18.04 of corpses was not all that outrageous but now many were doing that there's just a few crazy guys
01:08:18.04 --> 01:08:24.60 doing it and one of my one of my sergeants that did that and he had a whole had a whole pocket full
01:08:24.60 --> 01:08:29.48 and for some reason rather something happy changes fans or something and they were all so
01:08:29.48 --> 01:08:37.96 I'll get some more yeah I like the fact that you said basically that I mean somebody asked me
01:08:37.96 --> 01:08:43.16 about dehumanizing the enemy and when we were fighting and I rack and I said the enemy dehumanizes
01:08:43.16 --> 01:08:49.08 themselves with their what their actions that they would take and that's the same situation here
01:08:49.08 --> 01:08:57.000 you know the in Iraq the insurgents would be head people and skin people alive and just do
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.80 absolutely horrible I don't know what the Turks seem to be doing that right now it seems like I don't
01:09:01.80 --> 01:09:09.08 know that's a thing cleansing yeah there's definitely some uh it's hard to figure out what's going on
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:20.12 over there right now I saw some fresh reports of what going on in the absolute yeah it does not look good you
01:09:20.12 --> 01:09:23.88 also had some people that couldn't that didn't adopt that mentality and here's Murdoch talking
01:09:23.88 --> 01:09:30.92 about it talking about people that couldn't adopt that killer be killed mentality he said they'd
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:35.40 have to go back because they were no good to us they just disappear they'd be sent back to the
01:09:35.40 --> 01:09:39.80 states it was a self-weeding process the guys who remained were the guys you could depend on
01:09:40.36 --> 01:09:45.64 when I became company commander New Zealand that was an awful thing I had to do we could send
01:09:45.64 --> 01:09:50.76 3% of our personnel home every so often so they could start new outfits back in the states
01:09:50.76 --> 01:09:55.80 but you never wanted to send the good guys home you send the shitheads and the screwups I wanted
01:09:55.80 --> 01:10:01.48 the best men with me I didn't want any of my good men to go in New Zealand just before we sailed
01:10:01.48 --> 01:10:07.88 for Talawa Tarawa Murdoch told our company now listen I'm gonna send some of you guys home if you
01:10:07.88 --> 01:10:13.96 fuck up you're going to go but he told me later these kids were so good they just wouldn't do that
01:10:13.96 --> 01:10:18.60 they wouldn't fuck up on purpose they would do their job and do it well they didn't want to be
01:10:18.60 --> 01:10:23.64 come known as a fuck up and a lot of those kids were killed on Talawa that I could have sent home
01:10:24.68 --> 01:10:29.96 but that's what happened because I wanted to keep the good guys with me man that's a powerful
01:10:29.96 --> 01:10:36.20 statement all these guys have to do is be slackers and they'll get sent home to the states but they
01:10:36.20 --> 01:10:45.08 wouldn't do it that's the Marine Corps. The thing is this isn't a general average opinion I don't think
01:10:45.56 --> 01:10:52.60 he was a little bit overboard and all this discussion you know he's not difficult in other words
01:10:52.60 --> 01:10:58.68 but he was he was well-liked because of because of when he looked at life
01:10:58.68 --> 01:11:04.68 yeah he talks about one guy here he says I had one guy a platoon a lieutenant platoon leader will call him
01:11:04.68 --> 01:11:10.52 Mac. Yeah not as real names. That's the one I took over from and then where I almost got killed.
01:11:10.52 --> 01:11:15.48 He says he was a Yale graduate came from Connecticut very well brought up had money nice guy too
01:11:15.48 --> 01:11:20.68 and handsome a rugged look good looking Marine but on Guadalcanal he'd go on patrol he just could not handle it
01:11:21.48 --> 01:11:26.76 while he'd go bean yes was his platoon sergeant and he'd have to take over Mac's patrols all the time
01:11:26.76 --> 01:11:32.28 Mac tried but he couldn't do it I respected him for that he was trying the kids were calling him yellow
01:11:32.28 --> 01:11:37.24 and they'd say to me we don't want that guy he's yellow and I'd say wait just a minute that guy is not
01:11:37.24 --> 01:11:42.12 yellow he tried to do the job but he's just not he couldn't just couldn't do it just going to
01:11:42.92 --> 01:11:48.12 a yellow man doesn't go out and try he quits Mac won't go this go deenia see became an officer
01:11:48.12 --> 01:11:59.72 he married an anus elin gal I knew him pretty well all right so continuing on here by December
01:11:59.72 --> 01:12:04.44 our long so during the front line of taking a big toll we were wasted by illness multiple illnesses
01:12:04.44 --> 01:12:09.64 we were malnourished and looked it we went about shirtless showing squannie bodies with protruding ribs
01:12:09.64 --> 01:12:14.28 and vertebrae and salose skin stretched over stretched hotly over them our faces were drawn
01:12:14.28 --> 01:12:19.24 in angular beneath scraggly beards and our eyes were recessed in their orbits we didn't have a
01:12:19.24 --> 01:12:24.04 change of clothes during that period and we became unimaginably filthy we looked scary and
01:12:24.04 --> 01:12:28.92 menacing and pitiful a lot of us came down with yellow jannus see that that would do a
01:12:28.92 --> 01:12:36.84 liberate that would do you and too you know the constant threat of enemy attack punctuated by
01:12:36.84 --> 01:12:41.32 intermittent balance of actual fighting was tremendously stressful it seemed that much of the time
01:12:41.32 --> 01:12:46.84 we were either waiting to be attacked or being attacked or attacking the enemy ourselves or we were
01:12:46.84 --> 01:12:50.52 just sitting around trying to get some rest but feeling cruddy because we were sick and we always
01:12:50.52 --> 01:12:55.48 were tensed up thinking and worrying about our next combat action depending on how your day was going
01:12:55.48 --> 01:12:59.88 such concerns might be in the forefront of your thoughts incessant and acute making you all
01:12:59.88 --> 01:13:05.16 edgy and fretful or they might be buried deep usually they were somewhere in between but they were
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:09.48 always present in your head and on your mind you could never fully let go or get rid of them
01:13:09.48 --> 01:13:15.48 the unrelenting mental strain not to do not not to mention the physical dangers that caused it
01:13:15.48 --> 01:13:21.56 made us twitch your each passing day you know during the during the times that we were
01:13:22.12 --> 01:13:29.56 we were back behind the front lines and nobody's shooting at you home like I said it's wonderful
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:37.24 nobody's shooting at me and all that stress you know now you now you don't have to worry about it
01:13:37.24 --> 01:13:42.76 now what about the fact that even though no one's shooting at you right now you have time to
01:13:42.76 --> 01:13:47.08 sit there and think about the fact that you're going to go again and the enemy's going to attack you
01:13:47.08 --> 01:13:52.12 and you know somebody pull up pull it what it was stupid thing so it's through a hand grenade
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:59.64 dummy into a tent everybody just took off why would a guy do that I don't understand he thought it was funny
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:06.92 I'll tell you why I'm laughing when you tell that story because one of my friends what
01:14:06.92 --> 01:14:12.04 am I good friends a guy by the name of Lave Babin who I work with and wrote a book with
01:14:12.60 --> 01:14:17.24 wrote two books with him actually he did that two a couple of his guys took a
01:14:17.24 --> 01:14:22.36 took a grenade and we were in Ramadi and he took a grenade the pin was in it was still taped up
01:14:22.36 --> 01:14:26.44 but it was real grenade and there was a couple of guys sitting in a room talking and he just opened
01:14:26.44 --> 01:14:31.88 the door and rolled the grenade in there we were just talking about the other day yeah oh yeah
01:14:31.88 --> 01:14:35.48 we were just talking about the reason I remember we were just talking about yesterday and he goes
01:14:35.48 --> 01:14:39.72 yeah that wasn't smart it wasn't smart because who knows what's going to happen I mean those guys
01:14:39.72 --> 01:14:43.96 it with they had guns they might have shot I mean there's all kinds of crazy things that couldn't happen
01:14:43.96 --> 01:14:50.76 you make it mean later on yet in here but also in our last drive on Guadalconelle I had
01:14:50.76 --> 01:14:56.52 an enemy grenade filled right there by my legs and I tried to kick it away and hit something came
01:14:56.52 --> 01:15:12.92 right on back it was a dud. Here's Murdoch talking about Guadalconelle and why what made it
01:15:13.88 --> 01:15:18.28 what made it Guadalconelle he said each campaign was different each with different problems
01:15:18.28 --> 01:15:22.76 Tar was the worst in terms of fighting but the battle lasted only three days right after it
01:15:23.48 --> 01:15:28.76 we right after it ended we were taken off Baycheo and sent back to Hawaii but on Guadalconelle
01:15:28.76 --> 01:15:32.92 we were on Guadalconelle for three months. For the amount of time we were there we didn't do
01:15:32.92 --> 01:15:37.08 all that much fighting but there were other things the sickness and the heat especially the
01:15:37.08 --> 01:15:42.92 living conditions were the worst on Guadalconelle and then you say as bad as it was it was worse
01:15:42.92 --> 01:15:47.88 for the Japanese much worse their condition was no mystery for us as December gave way to January
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:53.96 there was a noticeable drop off an enemy activity that we correctly ascribed to their deteriorating
01:15:53.96 --> 01:15:59.000 health their nocturnal probes dwindled and in time virtually ceased altogether they simply
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:12.36 lacked the energy to come out us in the night. We didn't know they didn't even bother to yell at us
01:16:12.36 --> 01:16:17.40 they rarely achieved success when they did attack in battle we found we had as we been told on
01:16:17.40 --> 01:16:22.52 Simoa the Japanese made the same mistakes over and over for instance they would commit their units
01:16:22.52 --> 01:16:26.44 to battle as they became available instead of holding them back and massing them for a single
01:16:26.44 --> 01:16:31.40 powerful blow and they would keep coming in small coming out of until they were killed primarily
01:16:31.40 --> 01:16:36.12 by our artillery the carnage was sickening even to us weak and we couldn't understand why they
01:16:36.12 --> 01:16:41.16 never seemed to learn from their experiences and make the necessary adjustments. One one thing
01:16:41.16 --> 01:16:48.52 that was wrong with their strategy that they they had attacked and there was no command to change
01:16:48.52 --> 01:16:51.80 are you going to go out of flying or something like that to just keep coming and keep coming
01:16:51.80 --> 01:16:58.04 to other all kill. Yeah that's a lack of leadership and maneuver warfare right that's not
01:16:58.04 --> 01:17:01.88 no maneuver no maneuver at all no maneuver just hey we're going forward we're going to do a
01:17:01.88 --> 01:17:06.44 a frontal assault and they would just get killed to get mode down and that happened time and
01:17:06.44 --> 01:17:13.24 time again. Here we are coming in the terror law the same situation we had no no way to maneuver
01:17:13.24 --> 01:17:18.76 anything and just keep going into facing heavy machine gun fire just like the Japanese did.
01:17:20.20 --> 01:17:25.16 The Japanese thought their indelvinable will would provide them with a margin for victory it did
01:17:25.16 --> 01:17:30.44 not occur to them or they could not acknowledge that the Marines and soldiers they were battling
01:17:30.44 --> 01:17:37.96 were equally indelvinable and in the end victorious. They had so easy on moving all down through the
01:17:38.92 --> 01:17:45.72 the east end is not that and it's just everything just just faded away and they just kept going
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:53.56 no problem at all. And then they met American forces. So then so this is this is a turning point
01:17:53.56 --> 01:17:59.32 of going to go out and where they that's where they return the tables now where now we're in the offensive. Yeah
01:17:59.32 --> 01:18:07.72 do so January 10th you begin going on off. Eighth Marines the one eight the two eight and the
01:18:07.72 --> 01:18:13.72 three eight I worked with the three eight a bunch of your body they were outstanding. Yeah our mission orders
01:18:13.72 --> 01:18:19.24 issued by General Patch were to attack and destroy the Japanese format forces remaining on Guadalcanal.
01:18:19.24 --> 01:18:29.48 Yeah. We moved up and I'm just reading and I always have to mention this I'm obviously not reading
01:18:29.48 --> 01:18:35.16 this whole book. I could read this whole book. I want to read this whole book because the book is
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:39.64 outstanding but I'm jumping around so if it seems a little bit scattered it's because I'm jumping
01:18:39.64 --> 01:18:45.64 from I'm skipping over big chunks that you're telling with great detail and and this is this is one
01:18:45.64 --> 01:18:52.84 of the most outstanding accounts that exists of these campaigns. So just know that you have to buy
01:18:52.84 --> 01:18:59.000 the book the book is called Faith for Warriors. So here we go we moved we pushed on we moved up
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.96 and over hill 82 the hill and jungle draws below were in festo with Japanese my men saw a
01:19:03.96 --> 01:19:08.60 single Japanese soldier and open fire killing him instantly I collected some personal effects from
01:19:08.60 --> 01:19:14.68 his body a diary a lock of hair a first aid kit a photograph of a group of soldiers and a
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:20.28 thousand stitch belt which is a piece of cloth embroidered with a thousand stitches by wellwishers
01:19:20.28 --> 01:19:25.16 that he carried for good luck. No I sent a lot of this stuff that we took off of the dead home
01:19:25.16 --> 01:19:30.84 to Japan to their to their families eventually. Eventually and we'll probably get into a bit but
01:19:31.56 --> 01:19:36.68 the I received a letter from the brother one of these soldiers just beautifully done calligraphy
01:19:36.68 --> 01:19:43.000 you know. Yeah so you you held on to this stuff and eventually figured out who this got
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.68 did that because we we were asked to talk to a Japanese in Los Angeles and there's a Japanese
01:19:50.68 --> 01:19:59.000 Japanese area there and the the the priest there suggested I do that he couldn't speak any
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.08 English but through the translation I knew that that's what had to do and so we sent it
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:11.48 to the to the relatives of Philadelphia worked with at North American Aviation and
01:20:11.48 --> 01:20:19.48 his wife's family were Honda which is a Honda car and so we sent her to one of her cousins
01:20:20.20 --> 01:20:27.48 and when they they came to Fay baseball in this country after the war and they lost so they
01:20:27.48 --> 01:20:33.08 had lost face to so to speak so they wanted to go back with something so they took this all
01:20:33.08 --> 01:20:38.36 of these items that I'd taken off of these soldiers that we're talking about here and they put it
01:20:38.36 --> 01:20:45.80 in a white box strong around their neck as they got as they landed in Hawaii a lot of
01:20:45.80 --> 01:20:52.92 Buddhist priests were there with me to play when they got to Tokyo all a big thing always picked up
01:20:52.92 --> 01:21:02.52 and my name got all over all over Japan about over that incredible. What were you thinking about
01:21:02.52 --> 01:21:06.36 at the time I mean at the time you couldn't have been thinking about that all that was going
01:21:06.36 --> 01:21:13.48 to happen. You know and also you know where we we were asked to attend this Buddhist ceremony
01:21:14.20 --> 01:21:19.64 and my family had made three daughters with me and here we're the first ones in line and you're
01:21:19.64 --> 01:21:25.48 we're supposed to you're supposed to you had to carry these incense and there's a gong and
01:21:25.48 --> 01:21:33.48 goes on and well bunch of stuff we we led that procession as it went by then after that we we had a
01:21:33.48 --> 01:21:41.80 get together sokiyaki and and beer in the in the percentage yeah and I'd be real careful
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:46.36 what I said you know I had my friend as a translator be real careful they didn't call them
01:21:46.36 --> 01:21:52.04 japs and all that yeah and I said how come come there's so interesting what happened here
01:21:52.04 --> 01:21:57.88 as well these these people from northern part of Japan and they had no clue of what had
01:21:57.88 --> 01:22:07.08 happened to their soldiers way down south yeah because they didn't have enough weightness is
01:22:07.08 --> 01:22:13.48 living after the war you know to explain and then on on site pan and I was talking to Donny
01:22:13.48 --> 01:22:18.52 Edwards we were there at you been there you know where this what this call suicide clip
01:22:18.52 --> 01:22:24.28 well there there's one monument there and there were paid for by children raising the money
01:22:24.28 --> 01:22:32.12 and one of them faces south kneeling a mother mourning over her lost her sons lost in the
01:22:32.12 --> 01:22:38.84 south city the other was facing the suicide cliff mourning the children that were carried over
01:22:38.84 --> 01:22:46.04 the cliff to be killed and what is happening was they were just putting in the new monument
01:22:46.04 --> 01:22:50.60 they hadn't don't have the new captions yet and I was explaining to Donny what that what that
01:22:50.60 --> 01:22:59.96 was all about and it's on it's it's on uh uh uh Instagram go to Instagram and you go to best
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:08.28 defense foundation and they'll tell about it okay yeah so even though you're gathering souvenirs this
01:23:08.28 --> 01:23:13.80 is not over yet and here you go the fighting was constant but not everywhere at the same time one squad
01:23:13.80 --> 01:23:19.08 might be resting wall nearby another was engaged with a sharp fight yeah it's true with a sniper
01:23:19.08 --> 01:23:24.28 machine gunness and all up and down the line automatic weapons rattled rifles crack grenades
01:23:24.28 --> 01:23:30.04 popped the air carry this the stringent smell of cordite in places where there had been a lot of
01:23:30.04 --> 01:23:34.76 firing the atmosphere was hazy with gunsmoke and the smoke of burning foliage there was a lot of
01:23:34.76 --> 01:23:40.28 shouting someone screaming the and the frequent cry corpsman corpsman stretcher down this is not
01:23:40.28 --> 01:23:45.96 a general atmosphere this this is a certain locations this is happening because not here where you say
01:23:45.96 --> 01:23:49.72 yeah because then this is because the Japanese were really depleted at this point pretty much so yeah they
01:23:49.72 --> 01:23:56.76 will yeah uh stretcher bearers many of them musicians in the divisions band yeah right ran around
01:23:56.76 --> 01:24:02.04 the battlefield picking up the wounded and carrying them back the battalion aid station so every
01:24:02.04 --> 01:24:09.16 Marines arrive amen as well as there's the band out there there's the pressure pressure bearers
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:16.76 yeah 14 January we continue to advance the action much the same as the day before
01:24:16.76 --> 01:24:20.36 intermittent class with Japanese diehard some of the Japanese we came upon
01:24:20.36 --> 01:24:24.20 blew themselves up and their holes were just sat there and let us kill them with the grenades
01:24:24.20 --> 01:24:31.08 yeah my puttune made good progress you got a guy named the blowing sounds up a little hand
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:36.84 grenade right here put he had it and kick it off and his team blown south up right over here
01:24:36.84 --> 01:24:43.32 so with they trying to take Marines with him not well yeah as they could but when you get
01:24:43.32 --> 01:24:47.96 in a side panel explain there how would we we saw a hundred over a hundred doing that as we
01:24:47.96 --> 01:24:52.52 advance and they could have shot back as they didn't instead they just we got so close
01:24:53.24 --> 01:25:00.76 and they blown themselves bang bang bang as we as we as we had passed incredible
01:25:00.76 --> 01:25:10.60 uh one guy you lost a guy named Gunner Lund and you with a gunner Lund had kind of a
01:25:11.16 --> 01:25:16.28 had a kid that looked up to him made her shall wheelcy and you and he wrote he's a

01:25:49.32 --> 01:25:53.96 and loved for his tough his rough humor and for the obvious and genuine affection
01:25:53.96 --> 01:25:58.20 and concerned he felt for his young charges before the war he had been sea going marine
01:25:58.20 --> 01:26:03.000 serving on the beloved aircraft the Lexington he'd always been smoking a cigar how
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.08 we was able to keep himself stock with stowies on guano canals anyone's guess such
01:26:07.08 --> 01:26:11.40 of the talents of an old salt he used to say that after the war he was going to buy himself a
01:26:11.40 --> 01:26:16.92 big shiny cattle act convertible and ride around smoking his cigars instead of that high
01:26:16.92 --> 01:26:22.92 visit his family after the war he had a sister that had been to a dance and they couldn't
01:26:22.92 --> 01:26:29.56 find her anywhere she was dead in the trunk they found her body in the trunk of the car
01:26:29.56 --> 01:26:35.64 been murdered and they got this this same time as hit as when he the family found out about Lund
01:26:35.64 --> 01:26:45.48 oh yeah you said that that was a simple dream for a simple very good man a dream never realized
01:26:46.28 --> 01:26:50.84 all the kids looked up to Lund wheel skiing particular ski idolized Lund the gunner was everything
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:55.16 to him a hero mentor father figure older brother and best friend at first he refused to
01:26:55.16 --> 01:26:59.72 believe that Lund had been killed yeah i was just talking to him a few minutes ago he said
01:26:59.72 --> 01:27:04.04 but then the truth said again and he became distraught and threw his weapon on the ground this
01:27:04.04 --> 01:27:10.04 damn war he exclaimed yeah ski then announced he was quitting the marine core and quitting the war
01:27:10.04 --> 01:27:14.84 he meant what he said he was about to head back to the rear when Murdoch arrived on the scene
01:27:14.84 --> 01:27:19.32 Murdoch's calm ski down and told him that he just couldn't up and quit that it would be
01:27:19.32 --> 01:27:23.88 desertion in the face of the enemy and that he would get a lot of trouble for it Murdoch spoke
01:27:23.88 --> 01:27:29.64 softly with him for several minutes in this vein until ski came to a senses ski picked up as
01:27:29.64 --> 01:27:35.24 weapon and rejoined third platoon and Murdoch assumed command of that unit but ski was a changed man
01:27:35.88 --> 01:27:40.84 exchanging one man as for another he went from being a marine who did his job and did it well
01:27:40.84 --> 01:27:45.88 to being a marine who did his job with a singular passion from that day forward he hated the
01:27:45.88 --> 01:27:51.08 Japanese with a savage intensity and took it on himself to personally avenge Lund's death
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:55.96 often going off by himself to hunt the enemy if you were a compassionate man you might say a
01:27:55.96 --> 01:28:02.60 prayer for any Japanese soldiers who crossed his path he always returned eventually but with
01:28:02.60 --> 01:28:09.24 little to say about his exploits he was the quiet type guys like him usually are yeah
01:28:09.24 --> 01:28:20.60 he's the impediment he pedamy of a combat marine and so this continues on and then you say this
01:28:20.60 --> 01:28:24.84 and so to the end my memory of the final days of January offensive is blurry and I find it
01:28:24.84 --> 01:28:29.64 difficult to remember the details that reunions we reminisce about our very limited personnel
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:34.84 personal perspective of the offense and the countless little battles that were fought as we went
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:41.56 forward at that perilous time we focused primarily on our own concerns about adequate cover for
01:28:41.56 --> 01:28:46.52 incoming artillery and other life threatening events in our immediate area we advanced on a broad
01:28:46.52 --> 01:28:51.000 front but never in an even line some units always move faster than others depending on the terrain
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.36 and the resistance they encountered we went up and down more hills and ridges up and down up and down
01:28:56.36 --> 01:29:02.92 sometimes fighting and killing the Japanese sometimes just killing them and to January or last week
01:29:02.92 --> 01:29:07.96 on guadal canal be company was bivalact by Henderson Field awaiting transport off the island while
01:29:07.96 --> 01:29:12.76 there I came down with jaundice and I lost a lot of weight I would be getting off the island just
01:29:12.76 --> 01:29:18.12 in time in the meantime there were no duties to perform some of them very on there's on the
01:29:18.12 --> 01:29:22.20 in the meantime there were still duties to perform in some of them very unpleasant one of Murdoch's
01:29:22.20 --> 01:29:27.16 responsibility was to record the location of the battle site graves on an overlay it troubled him
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:32.44 that the locations couldn't always be specifically pin-boinered so there was no so there could be no assurance
01:29:32.44 --> 01:29:37.48 that the bodies would later be found for relocation to permanent cemetery now regarding those bodies
01:29:38.28 --> 01:29:45.48 year or so go the organization that at locate bodies and get some buried all there and
01:29:46.68 --> 01:29:53.96 they're in hoi and on lilloo and they ran out of money but they were going to pay for me go down
01:29:53.96 --> 01:30:01.08 and help them locate these bodies we're talking about but the guy that he was he was a doctorate
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:06.44 and he says I just I just ran out of legal room money wise couldn't do it
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:18.12 so finally this is last year wow yeah well maybe we can raise some money for him
01:30:20.12 --> 01:30:25.40 this was a call cheap back and then it's now a new name they probably might say they were missed missed
01:30:25.40 --> 01:30:31.96 they were missed missed they were missed handling money there's many money where they shouldn't have
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:37.64 been so a lot of those going on you probably heard about and then the new secretary fan came
01:30:37.64 --> 01:30:49.32 down he did he just changed the whole thing around so we wrapped this up the section on January
01:30:49.32 --> 01:30:55.48 on 31 January the one eight and the entire second regiment boarded the troop transport crescent city
01:30:55.48 --> 01:31:00.92 and then during the first week of February the Japanese managed to evacuate more than 11,000 troops
01:31:00.92 --> 01:31:07.24 a minor triumph that did little to offset the magnets you do there to feet they lost upward of 25,000 men
01:31:07.24 --> 01:31:13.000 in Guadalcanal campaign of these maybe a thousand were taken prisoner our losses were comparatively small
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:21.88 according to army historians about 1600 were killed and 4,245 were wounded on nine February the
01:31:21.88 --> 01:31:26.76 rest of the eighth Marines left Guadalcanal on board the troop ship hunter ligate at American
01:31:26.76 --> 01:31:34.52 Legion that same day Guadalcanal was declared secure one way or another for the living and the dead
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.72 the fighting on Guadalcanal was over forever
01:31:37.72 --> 01:31:54.60 so your next chapter here is called heaven yeah because from the hell of Guadalcanal you went to
01:31:54.60 --> 01:32:01.56 a place called New Zealand and this was quite the change for you all going from Guadalcanal
01:32:01.56 --> 01:32:09.88 to New Zealand no longer sweating jungles you you highlight some of the good things about
01:32:09.88 --> 01:32:14.28 New Zealand and then then you get to what apparently is the biggest highlight in New Zealand
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:20.12 it says this there were girls holy smokes whether they're all gone but they were
01:32:20.92 --> 01:32:25.32 they were welcome here so for no because they're men were overfighting because they were
01:32:25.32 --> 01:32:31.40 in North Africa young girls pretty girls smiling girls they were everywhere lots of them
01:32:31.40 --> 01:32:38.28 my girl my girlfriend was 19 and not here I was I was approaching 23 he 22 she's still alive she's
01:32:38.28 --> 01:32:45.16 95 no wow can you imagine they stared at us and we stared at them and they smiled at us
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:50.28 and we smiled at them and in many instances we greeted each other and exchange pleasantries
01:32:50.28 --> 01:32:56.52 and actually conversed with them even the castanovas among us had a hard gov at at first
01:32:56.52 --> 01:33:00.44 it had been a long time since we had spoken with girls we were out of practice we were also
01:33:00.44 --> 01:33:05.64 gasey is the term you use staring inward a thousand yards back into our heads flashing on our
01:33:05.64 --> 01:33:11.40 thoughts and visions of Guadalcanal put in there our faces and what do you have for that
01:33:13.08 --> 01:33:15.16 just be just yeah just remembering yeah
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:22.12 the contrast was immediately apparent profoundly jarring we had learned how to handle hell
01:33:22.68 --> 01:33:27.64 but heaven would take some getting used to a board ship we we hadn't been aware of our gasey
01:33:27.64 --> 01:33:33.48 conditioned we all seem normal to each other but here in this beautiful city among these wonderful
01:33:33.48 --> 01:33:38.84 civilized people among all those pretty girls it was possible to see how far from normal we were
01:33:38.84 --> 01:33:48.04 what would they think of us they loved us and we loved them right back so you guys I mean you
01:33:48.04 --> 01:33:53.000 do talk about some of the things that happened there and some of those adjustments getting into it
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000 and and then the kind of I guess the kind of mayhem and chaos that you were more dark himself
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.04 he there's one story about where where he come barging barging into the owner the woman owner
01:34:06.04 --> 01:34:15.88 the hotel where our her officers mess where the get together was and it tells about it in there
01:34:15.88 --> 01:34:23.56 yeah anyway he comes he called he crawled he was drunk no clothes on I guess and crawled along an
01:34:23.56 --> 01:34:29.24 edge and then wrapped on the window and she opened it up that I mean he ended up going then next morning
01:34:29.24 --> 01:34:38.52 woke up here's with us older woman and oh my gosh yes she says something like you know good
01:34:38.52 --> 01:34:42.92 morning he says did I have a good time or something like that but she said yes you did
01:34:44.52 --> 01:34:48.44 sounded like he she he was avoiding her for the rest of the time yeah yeah you
01:34:51.48 --> 01:34:57.72 all right to get back to the military side of this after a few weeks new Zealand we started
01:34:57.72 --> 01:35:02.60 training in earnest we we needed a lot of training both to get ourselves back into shape and incorporate
01:35:02.60 --> 01:35:07.48 replacements who are streaming in from the states our experience on Guadalcanal provided the template
01:35:07.48 --> 01:35:13.16 for our training we built positions on the Japanese model and practiced attacking them we advanced
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:17.64 through wooded areas against simulated sniper attacks we worked on the use of supporting fires
01:35:17.64 --> 01:35:23.000 and we worked with tanks one of the most important changes overall was to give the squad leaders
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.84 more freedom of action to make decisions in combat let them decide on their own how to maneuver
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:36.36 their men and move around to develop and any members I'm sure there's no room for maneuver
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:44.28 no no no chance to use tanks but it's interesting you know we we talk a lot about
01:35:44.28 --> 01:35:47.56 kind of the principles of combat leadership and one of the most important principles of combat
01:35:47.56 --> 01:35:52.44 leadership is decentralized command and that is allowing your support and leaders to lead and that
01:35:52.44 --> 01:35:57.48 right there even the private say even a private say come on guys this going he pull them together
01:35:57.48 --> 01:36:02.12 let's go yeah and and you that's obviously you're taking that lesson that's it then you say
01:36:02.12 --> 01:36:07.40 that's a change overall yeah you guys even you all realized hey we need our frontline troops to
01:36:07.40 --> 01:36:13.40 be able to lead yeah yeah I mentioned that when I I spoken to Marine Corps League you know
01:36:13.40 --> 01:36:18.12 the Marine Corps birthday balls know that and I mentioned that leadership aspect
01:36:18.12 --> 01:36:23.000 you're written books about two I know I have it's one of the things I talk about all the time
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.08 oh yeah and when I taught leadership inside the steel teams that's one of the main things I
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:33.48 needed the young troopers to do who you would have been a disaster that had happened yeah
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:40.28 so fast forward a bit through the you talk some more about that training and what it's like
01:36:40.28 --> 01:36:45.56 in New Zealand and the continues on and then finally we get to this I'm not going to say that
01:36:45.56 --> 01:36:50.36 we knew we were leaving for good but many sense this might be the case so did everyone in Wellington
01:36:50.36 --> 01:36:55.64 the girls especially just before our ships cast off again for Hawks Bay a number of girls some
01:36:55.64 --> 01:37:01.56 hugely pregnant came down to the docks to find out what was going on nobody could or would tell them anything
01:37:02.44 --> 01:37:07.48 but many had dire for it nobody knew you guys didn't even know we did had no no never clue
01:37:07.48 --> 01:37:13.000 without we're going another another another land here exercise our ship steam north past Hawks Bay
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.80 continued on a northern league yet after a few days it's he was announced that we were going to
01:37:17.80 --> 01:37:24.68 invade the Taroa toll in the Gilbert Islands maps and sand tables were brought it out one square mile
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:31.16 one square mile our sudden permanent disappearance from New Zealand was very hard on our Kiwi
01:37:31.16 --> 01:37:37.24 girlfriends and wives one day they woke up to find us gone a new year head into battle
01:37:37.24 --> 01:37:42.28 then towards the end of November they started hearing rumors that a lot of us had been killed
01:37:43.24 --> 01:37:53.72 the rumors proved to be true yeah we lost over eleven hundred killed and twenty five hundred
01:37:53.72 --> 01:38:03.24 wounded in three days most of them two days so you get to Taroa and here we are the navy promised
01:38:03.24 --> 01:38:08.12 us a preliminary build bombardment that would blow the Japanese and their defenses to kingdom come
01:38:08.12 --> 01:38:12.36 leaving the Marines to carry out what would amount to little more than a mopping up operation
01:38:13.08 --> 01:38:19.000 during a pre invasion staff briefing an admiral announced that it was not the navy's intention
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:25.24 merely to neutralize ratio island gentlemen he told me assemblage we will obliterate it
01:38:26.12 --> 01:38:31.48 this statement was passed on to rank and file and we believed it at the same briefing a battle ship
01:38:31.48 --> 01:38:36.52 captain declared we are going to bombard at six thousand yards we've got so much armor
01:38:36.52 --> 01:38:41.08 we're not afraid of anything the japs control back at us the commander of the second marine
01:38:41.08 --> 01:38:46.44 division major general julian c-smith was in sense to buy the captains brave words gentlemen
01:38:46.44 --> 01:38:51.72 he retorted remember one thing when the Marines land and meet the enemy at bay net point
01:38:51.72 --> 01:38:58.60 the only armor a marine will have is his khaki shirt it is unbelievable though when you see
01:38:58.60 --> 01:39:02.84 the bombardment you can see film of the bombardment at Taroa i mean they just look like it was just
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:11.08 obliterators right and i had i had a situation where my guys in the battle of ramaati
01:39:12.04 --> 01:39:20.68 got caught in a friendly fire situation and you were there ramaati yep and uh an army unit that
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:28.04 we had called for qrf came in and put about 150 rounds of 50 caliber machine gun fire into the building
01:39:28.04 --> 01:39:36.04 that my guys were in at a range of about 25 meters 150 rounds and you you would think anybody
01:39:36.04 --> 01:39:41.64 that's seen a 50 caliber machine gun you'd think everyone in that building would be dead but
01:39:41.64 --> 01:39:48.12 what i'd one guy get wounded it wasn't actually all that bad and so when you see the the that's
01:39:48.12 --> 01:39:54.84 why you can never trust that you know big bombs are going to actually solve the problem it doesn't
01:39:54.84 --> 01:39:59.72 always happen and this is a classic example of that and the main reason that naval gun fire
01:39:59.72 --> 01:40:04.92 wasn't wasn't all that effective is that we're just only you know the land was only about six
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:11.80 foot above sea level so things you must have just gone over if you hit there it's just such a narrow
01:40:11.80 --> 01:40:19.16 target and they what you should have done is landed on a adjacent island and pounded it with
01:40:19.16 --> 01:40:24.68 what the way mortars are you know a sharp rain artillery safe fire and that's what they did and that's
01:40:24.68 --> 01:40:28.68 what they did in the marshals they made all difference their world less and learn to no much later
01:40:29.32 --> 01:40:33.32 so you say this it's tough going right from the start the Japanese are heavily armed firmly and deeply
01:40:33.32 --> 01:40:38.84 entrenched and as always they've resist fiercely infecting heavy uh inflicting heavy casualties
01:40:38.84 --> 01:40:43.08 on our assault teams the radio reports start coming in their spotty and intermittent but we get the
01:40:43.08 --> 01:40:48.52 picture encountering heavy resistance heavy machine gun fire boats destroyed units scattered
01:40:48.52 --> 01:40:53.24 many casualties the voices on the loudspeakers are numerate these calamities and measured tones
01:40:53.24 --> 01:40:59.08 they sound calm almost attached if you if you didn't know better you'd think the situation wasn't too
01:40:59.08 --> 01:41:05.88 terrible but we knew better we were all looking at each other thinking some version of oh boy this is bad
01:41:05.88 --> 01:41:13.08 this is really bad the tides the tides which were supposed to cover the reef to an adequate depth
01:41:13.08 --> 01:41:18.84 proved uncooperative the waters too shallow just inches and just inches deep in some spots
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:23.24 and always less than needed for the three foot draft of the landing craft see the problem
01:41:23.24 --> 01:41:29.48 was that there was just barely three feet what we require for now CBP to clear the reef
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:35.24 but we got hung up with their big guns their their big naval guns shooting under
01:41:35.24 --> 01:41:40.52 transports so our transports had to move further out that means the all landing craft took a
01:41:40.52 --> 01:41:45.64 lot longer to get in and the meantime the tide was going out now we didn't have three feet
01:41:47.88 --> 01:41:53.88 not only that it was the kind of a tide that was extra low so you you were actually
01:41:54.60 --> 01:41:59.000 part of the reserve element is that is that the right we were going what you were doing the one
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.72 out the the battalion on him was going to was supposed to land on the next island up
01:42:03.72 --> 01:42:10.76 instead hey oh we need to write down here in real and unright the middle where the worst of
01:42:10.76 --> 01:42:16.52 it was so here here we had our guys on the beach and here here the enemy should know where
01:42:16.52 --> 01:42:25.16 they're head right at us out there we could do anything but yeah terrible so just for folks
01:42:25.16 --> 01:42:31.08 they don't understand what you just said you've got marines on the beach on the beach looking at us
01:42:31.08 --> 01:42:35.80 Washington's being mowed down and you're at sea and we can't shoot back you can't shoot because
01:42:35.80 --> 01:42:40.52 now there's friendly forces in between you two just and like you said the sea level is only
01:42:40.52 --> 01:42:48.28 are the altitude only six feet and not only that there was one beach to have a British transport
01:42:48.84 --> 01:42:53.48 and it was beach it it had been run before we landed there sometime before about time before
01:42:53.48 --> 01:43:00.52 our work and run up like on on the reef and just was still there while the Japanese swam up to it
01:43:00.52 --> 01:43:08.84 with the machine guns they fired flying in fire right on us so all this is happening and you
01:43:08.84 --> 01:43:13.80 run the reserves and finally you guys are told all right load your boats which means you guys
01:43:13.80 --> 01:43:17.88 now know you're going in and you say here we don't know whether the brass is setting us yet but we
01:43:17.88 --> 01:43:23.24 don't expect to go where the fighting is hottest and we expect to go soon we circle and circle
01:43:23.24 --> 01:43:27.16 in the lagoon we're standing in the boat either leaning against the sides or holding on them
01:43:27.16 --> 01:43:31.24 for balance in general we have a soft ride because the water is mostly still except for the
01:43:31.24 --> 01:43:37.64 turbulence caused by all the boats the turbulence buffets the LCVPs and this movement combined
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:43.80 with the stench of the engine and the nervous tension we all feel makes many of a sick some of the sick
01:43:43.80 --> 01:43:48.20 men some of the sick men stick their heads over the sides to stretch while there's puke into the
01:43:48.20 --> 01:43:53.000 wooden deck the men standing next to them just step aside like it's no big deal to get sick
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.48 because it really isn't a big deal when the men when the sick men finish wretched they straighten
01:43:57.48 --> 01:44:03.08 up as if nothing had happened no one thinks the worst of them for it after a while depending on how
01:44:03.08 --> 01:44:07.88 long we're out there in the boat the deck might be slippery with puke but that's no big deal either
01:44:07.88 --> 01:44:12.36 you can't smell the vomit or anything else for that matter because the exhaust fumes overpower
01:44:12.36 --> 01:44:19.48 every other smell diesel engine help the minutes go by lengthening into hours the hours go by
01:44:19.48 --> 01:44:25.64 but we're going nowhere we're just going around and around the sounds of battle are muted this far out
01:44:25.64 --> 01:44:30.60 we can hear artillery explosions but not small arms fire we're all peering over the sides looking
01:44:30.60 --> 01:44:35.96 abysio looking at the fires and the smoke and the explosions it's an awesome sight a massive smoke and
01:44:35.96 --> 01:44:41.24 flames holy Moses look at that we say not for the last time we ask ourselves how many of the
01:44:41.24 --> 01:44:46.52 defenders how the defenders could survive in a place so torn up it's an irrelevant question really
01:44:46.52 --> 01:44:54.28 many Japanese have survived and they're killing them but have them survived we know that a lot of
01:44:54.28 --> 01:45:00.20 our men were killed going in and we know that the men who did make it a sure are fighting for their
01:45:00.20 --> 01:45:05.48 lives we expect we'll have a tough go of it to wear apprehensive who wouldn't be and we're wondering
01:45:05.48 --> 01:45:10.36 how we'll behave in combat I know the new guys are especially concerned with how they'll behave
01:45:10.36 --> 01:45:16.12 the great fear the greatest of fear is you won't be able to handle it that you'll turn yellow
01:45:16.12 --> 01:45:21.96 that you'll let your buddies down we fear this much more than we fear getting killed or wounded
01:45:21.96 --> 01:45:25.96 one reason for that is no one really thinks he'll be killed or wounded you never think it's going
01:45:25.96 --> 01:45:31.24 to happen to you never you acknowledge that it could happen to you that it might happen to you
01:45:31.24 --> 01:45:36.60 but the rational part of your brain makes you understand this but in the such circumstances we now
01:45:36.60 --> 01:45:42.68 find ourselves emotion trumps rationality every time we know we're too young to die and somehow
01:45:42.68 --> 01:45:47.56 in a kind of strange and protective twist of logic and feeling we figure that because we're too
01:45:47.56 --> 01:45:53.56 young to die we certainly won't die you've got to do a lot of hard thinking to reach this conclusion
01:45:53.56 --> 01:45:58.60 however and because we're all thinking so hard we're not talking that much just as well
01:45:58.60 --> 01:46:02.36 the engine is so loud you can't talk or hear anyone except the guy standing next to you
01:46:03.24 --> 01:46:07.72 we wait for the word to begin the assault but it doesn't come we continue circling beneath the
01:46:07.72 --> 01:46:14.68 hot sun beneath breathing exhaust fumes staring at the island we want we want to know what for
01:46:14.68 --> 01:46:19.08 Pete's sake is happening we wonder what they're when they're going to send us in and where
01:46:19.08 --> 01:46:24.52 they're going to send us we wonder gosh how much longer can it go all like this a lot longer it
01:46:24.52 --> 01:46:31.64 turns out nightfall one moment in the sun one moment the sun is above the horizon and their sky is
01:46:31.64 --> 01:46:35.40 bright then the sun drops below the horizon in the dark that's how night comes in the
01:46:35.40 --> 01:46:41.32 tropics no twilight this is on the on-hequator you see yeah boom it's gone yeah it's bright one moment
01:46:41.32 --> 01:46:48.20 dark the next beijo isn't dark however beijo is on fire and the sky above it glowing red suddenly
01:46:48.20 --> 01:46:55.16 it's morning see the problem is that the top command thought we'd already landed and really there was
01:46:55.16 --> 01:47:01.80 just a lack there was all communications were disrupted so you guys are out there for so they didn't
01:47:01.80 --> 01:47:06.28 know we're out there still circling didn't know it how much fuel does things have because you're
01:47:06.28 --> 01:47:15.32 out there for twenty hours oh twenty hours yeah amazing not horrible yeah that's usually
01:47:15.32 --> 01:47:18.68 Sunday it's morning the sun pops over the horizon and then there was light we're still
01:47:18.68 --> 01:47:22.84 circling waiting for orders base you always still burning I was wondering how our boat can carry
01:47:22.84 --> 01:47:29.32 enough fuel to circle how long is it 12 14 16 hours answer we float we were float for about 20 hours
01:47:29.32 --> 01:47:34.76 our mouths dry our muscle stiff we feel haggard and cruddy some guys are sipping from their
01:47:34.76 --> 01:47:39.000 cantines or nibbling on the rations although there's not much eating because we just aren't hungry
01:47:40.44 --> 01:47:46.76 about five zero five thirty the LCVBA LCVP carrying our batai commander major major
01:47:46.76 --> 01:47:51.000 warranties chugs along up next to our boat cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting to
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:57.000 make himself heard above the noise of the boat engines he says we're going in at red beach too oh no
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.96 and what what why was that why was that a bad thing we knew that that probably
01:48:01.96 --> 01:48:05.64 some way we knew that that was where they haven't heard this time was on that beach
01:48:07.72 --> 01:48:13.80 still shouting major haze assures us that red too won't be a problem the Japanese positions
01:48:13.80 --> 01:48:18.52 on the beach have been eliminated he tells us and our landing will be unopposed you'll probably
01:48:18.52 --> 01:48:23.72 go in standing up he actually said that so you said in the book he actually said I guess we were
01:48:23.72 --> 01:48:30.44 completely surprised thinking back we were none of us really believed we'd go in standing up now
01:48:30.44 --> 01:48:35.56 not that we think meet major haze is feeding us a line he's a good man he wouldn't do that
01:48:35.80 --> 01:48:41.96 but it could be that he has been misinformed uninformed is more likely more like it totally
01:48:41.96 --> 01:48:47.08 uninformed communications with the units ashore or deseray and several instances functionally
01:48:47.08 --> 01:48:51.72 not existed the same goes for communications with general smith and his staff on the battle
01:48:51.72 --> 01:48:57.80 ship Maryland the invasions fleet flagship this is doing large but charged measure to failure
01:48:57.80 --> 01:49:01.96 of our radios which are too fragile to withstand the rigors of amphibious assault
01:49:02.76 --> 01:49:07.08 I've got a walking talking strapped over my shoulder and it's a hunk of joke hunk of junk
01:49:07.08 --> 01:49:12.44 I can't even communicate with the other boats which is why major haze had to come by in
01:49:12.44 --> 01:49:17.56 but that's true what was that what was the fucking dog is what we're doing any good now the
01:49:17.56 --> 01:49:24.04 officer in charge a red two at that time was Colonel Schupe the 10 of Colonel Schupe he became the
01:49:24.04 --> 01:49:31.64 combatant later on years later in any event we're relieved the waiting is almost over the business
01:49:31.64 --> 01:49:36.12 of riding around in boats is for the birds we want to get ashore and throw some punches I'm
01:49:36.12 --> 01:49:41.88 standing in the battle of our LCVP behind me are 32 marines of my pertune most of them teenagers
01:49:41.88 --> 01:49:46.92 most of them new to combat I look at them and they look at me I see fresh boyace facias
01:49:46.92 --> 01:49:54.52 and wide-wired eyes staring out from beneath their brain their helmet brims their helmets
01:49:54.52 --> 01:50:00.84 all seem a size too big accentuating their boyish making them look young as well most of them
01:50:00.84 --> 01:50:06.04 really are their helmets jammed down on their heads the straps pulled tight under their chin you
01:50:06.04 --> 01:50:10.20 can wear helmets this way so they don't fall off while you're clamoring down the cargo nets of
01:50:10.20 --> 01:50:14.44 the troop transport into your boat the helmet is nothing more than a steel pot heavy and getting
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:18.76 heavier the longer you wear it if it falls off all you're on that net it could hit somebody beneath
01:50:18.76 --> 01:50:23.56 you somebody could get hurt and that's when and that's not when marines are supposed to get hurt
01:50:23.56 --> 01:50:28.12 not during the boating phase as it's called the phase of the operation when the emphasis is on
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:34.28 safety the getting hurt part the part where safety is one might say beside the point comes later
01:50:34.84 --> 01:50:38.84 for us for me in the men in my boat that part comes now
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:46.60 did I say men well I suppose they are we call them men we treat them as men we expect them to act
01:50:46.60 --> 01:50:53.000 like men they are after all united states marines but really their kids just out of high school
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.92 or not even that kids with rifles true kids trained to kill also true but kids never the last
01:50:58.92 --> 01:51:07.000 just turn 17 many of them to use a term like that as long since fallen into general disuse their
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:14.44 youths a state of being between childhood and adulthood today's american mail at exercising
01:51:14.44 --> 01:51:19.72 a lifestyle choice can often can and often does loiter for many years in that state but in the
01:51:19.72 --> 01:51:27.48 mid-1940s in a world at war the state of youth tends to pass swiftly and do any disayet violently
01:51:28.12 --> 01:51:33.64 the youth the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be
01:51:33.64 --> 01:51:39.32 doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period
01:51:40.36 --> 01:51:45.48 far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience
01:51:47.32 --> 01:51:56.52 these are the men that went in and I have a WRK written on all the casualties in this picture
01:51:56.52 --> 01:52:04.68 and roughly half half her casualties going in
01:52:08.92 --> 01:52:11.16 in that period
01:52:12.44 --> 01:52:17.08 the youths the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:22.04 doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period many
01:52:22.04 --> 01:52:27.48 far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience they will transition
01:52:28.20 --> 01:52:32.92 with almost obscene dispatch from youth to adulthood to the grave
01:52:34.52 --> 01:52:41.96 a beggio youth won't be served it will be served up and consumed literally in fire these youths will be
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:50.84 men only briefly and then they will be just a memory forever all of this sounds as if i'm a
01:52:50.84 --> 01:52:56.68 grizzled veteran i am a combat veteran i fought in Guadalcanal earlier this year but the fact is i'm
01:52:56.68 --> 01:53:01.80 just 23 years old still young and not all that grizzled in appearance or temperament practically
01:53:01.80 --> 01:53:08.36 speaking though i'm the graveyard of this bunch same goes for the platoon sergeant who's about my age
01:53:08.36 --> 01:53:13.80 where the tribal elders the warrior chiefs i'll lead my boys off the boat and the platoon sergeant
01:53:13.80 --> 01:53:19.08 standing in the back will make sure they follow urging them and conjolling them yelling at them
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:24.60 maybe throwing a few choice cuss words whatever it takes to get them moving i'm watching my
01:53:24.60 --> 01:53:31.08 boys as they watch me things begin to happen fast with the majors lzvp leading the way our boats
01:53:31.08 --> 01:53:39.48 break formation one after the other and file off to our departure line this is an invisible line
01:53:39.48 --> 01:53:44.92 about 6,000 yards offshore that runs parallel to the landing beaches when we get there our boats are
01:53:44.92 --> 01:53:50.36 form up all the inline abreast arrayed like a cavalry squadron waiting for the bugle to sound
01:53:50.36 --> 01:53:54.76 charge the coxons rev and gun the engines in neutral gear and the boats are rearing and
01:53:54.76 --> 01:54:00.12 lurching trump charting at the bit it's as if the coxons are struggling to rain in war horses
01:54:00.12 --> 01:54:05.24 that can't contain their eagerness for battle our boats engine is blasting the noise almost painful
01:54:05.24 --> 01:54:11.64 to the years we're pumped up my men i and i i we're really pumped up the adrenaline is flowing
01:54:11.64 --> 01:54:15.88 surging through us clutching our weapons looking over the side of the boat at the island breathing
01:54:15.88 --> 01:54:22.68 hard thinking fast focused on the tastered hand stealing ourselves getting ready ready ready
01:54:22.68 --> 01:54:28.52 here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes us all over the light brigade
01:54:28.52 --> 01:54:37.88 but thinking right there yes yes and repeating repeating verbs as well you see
01:54:37.88 --> 01:54:42.04 oh i'm ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready yeah ready yeah
01:54:43.40 --> 01:54:48.92 little literary yeah little little literary so that's that's that's that's the thank you behind
01:54:48.92 --> 01:54:55.72 tip of the hat yeah here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes the throttle
01:54:55.72 --> 01:55:00.76 wide open the engine bellows betch's belch's smoke the stern dips the men in the boat rock
01:55:00.76 --> 01:55:05.88 back slightly as the boat leaps forward now we're barreling toward the island our boat all the
01:55:05.88 --> 01:55:13.16 boat 600 men more less of the first battalion eight marines water churning boiling behind the boat
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:18.28 we're bucketing and bouncing bullying ahead with our squared off bow musseling the water aside
01:55:18.28 --> 01:55:23.08 the boat is throwing spray soaking us and we're getting closer closer to the island
01:55:24.04 --> 01:55:29.56 we're about 800 yards from the shore when zip zip zip we hear tiny objects flying past
01:55:29.56 --> 01:55:34.44 and those aren't hornets boys their bullets we're in the range of the Japanese machine guns
01:55:34.44 --> 01:55:40.76 and good gosh they're shooting at us we find this interesting bullets zipping by
01:55:40.76 --> 01:55:45.96 splatting on the water surface splash splat here splat there splats to the left and right
01:55:45.96 --> 01:55:51.48 splats in front of us look by golly there's some enemy fire hitting right over there look over there
01:55:51.48 --> 01:55:56.44 that's me talking that's all of us talking talking and pointing at the impact circles in the water
01:55:56.44 --> 01:56:01.16 little splats little dots where bullets hit people shooting at us fascinating
01:56:01.16 --> 01:56:06.04 realizing that we could get our head shot off we ducked down and ducked down into the boat
01:56:06.04 --> 01:56:12.04 the more bullets splatting into the water but none hit our LCVP we tell ourselves that those are
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:18.04 that most are 7.7 millimeter slugs which is what your basic light Japanese machine gun fires
01:56:18.04 --> 01:56:22.44 and are nothing really much to worry about because they're too small to pierce even the thin
01:56:22.44 --> 01:56:28.12 skined higgins boat that's what we tell ourselves all right but we really don't believe it
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:33.88 we know good and well that the Japanese are also shooting at at us with heavier automatic weapon weapons
01:56:33.88 --> 01:56:39.80 big 13 millimeter machine guns and the even bigger dual purpose anti boat anti aircraft guns
01:56:39.80 --> 01:56:45.48 which range in size from 37 millimeter to 77 millimeter and they're lobbying shells from 70
01:56:45.48 --> 01:56:52.28 millimeter mountain howwitsers these weapons can and do inflict considerable damage on our
01:56:52.28 --> 01:56:58.20 salt teams killing and wounded hunting hundreds of them disabling or destroying many amtrax and
01:56:58.20 --> 01:57:04.92 LCVPs they're not my conceife concern however and never mind that they might at any second
01:57:04.92 --> 01:57:09.88 blow us to eternity what really bugs me is being hunkered down in this boat where I can't see anything
01:57:09.88 --> 01:57:14.52 I can't see where we are where we're going where we should be I can't observe the enemy fire
01:57:14.52 --> 01:57:19.16 engage resistance we're likely to encounter I feel as if I'm going into battle blindfolded
01:57:19.16 --> 01:57:23.56 this really stinks how can I do my job if I can't see anything how can I be sure the
01:57:23.56 --> 01:57:29.72 coxin is taking us to the right place my men what are they thinking they're watching me
01:57:29.72 --> 01:57:35.72 watching to see how I'm bearing up well I'm watching them too and for the same reason they look
01:57:35.72 --> 01:57:43.000 okay check that they look grim and resigned but that's good grim and resigned look means they've
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.88 more or less accepted this situation which is also good because the situation isn't going to change
01:57:47.88 --> 01:57:54.36 unless it changes for the worse this whole thing is on the rails it's a runaway train and there's
01:57:54.36 --> 01:57:59.000 nothing going to stop it now if you know this if you accept it you can keep your fear under control
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.88 and if you can keep your fear under control you'll do your job you won't let your buddies down
01:58:05.32 --> 01:58:10.52 so we're doing fine relatively speaking the boat is racing toward the shore when
01:58:10.52 --> 01:58:17.72 crying scraping bottom metal grinding on coral it abruptly stops we're thrown forward cursing
01:58:17.72 --> 01:58:22.60 we've run a ground all along the reef it's the same boat grinding to a halt on base
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:28.36 yours fringing reef I think what the heck the tide is supposed to be up the water deep enough to
01:58:28.36 --> 01:58:35.88 allow the LCVPs to clear the reef we're 600 yards from the shore 600 long yards this just cannot be
01:58:35.88 --> 01:58:45.08 wrong it can be it is though we're not aware of it where victims of the same disagreeable
01:58:45.08 --> 01:58:50.20 title conditions that fouled up yesterday's landings this is as far as we go our cox and yells
01:58:50.76 --> 01:58:57.16 we're going on mode his passengers are not happy there are exclamations of astonishment and protest
01:58:57.16 --> 01:59:02.60 oh shit you gotta be kidding but he's not kidding yeah this is far as we go here repeats we're hung up
01:59:02.60 --> 01:59:07.80 we've hit the reef you gotta get out here then he works the controls that release the cables that
01:59:07.80 --> 01:59:13.88 hold the ramp up the cables which are still strong along the sides of the whole unwind with a
01:59:13.88 --> 01:59:20.84 macaalic metallic rasp the ramp screeches as it opens drops splashes into the water and there
01:59:20.84 --> 01:59:29.32 before us is basio in all its hideous glory not to exaggerate or overdramatize but it is a scene
01:59:29.32 --> 01:59:34.76 from hell i mean one second we're looking at this slab of a metal ramp then the ramp drops and
01:59:34.76 --> 01:59:40.92 we're looking at it in furno fire and smoke fill our bit frame of vision frame by the sides of the
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:46.92 bottom and the bottom of the boat orange fire red fire and black black smoke the fire is shooting
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:54.04 up the smoke is rolling curling climbing is fast and high the sky isn't high enough to contain it
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:59.000 you think we were looking at a volcano being born you wonder what could produce so much smoke
02:00:00.04 --> 02:00:06.92 surely by now everything on basio that can burn has burned so where's all that smoke coming from
02:00:06.92 --> 02:00:11.16 from the bowels of the earth it would seem from somewhere deep underground under the ocean
02:00:11.16 --> 02:00:17.32 from the ever ever blazing furnaces of the world unless not forget the explosions there are a lot of
02:00:17.32 --> 02:00:23.000 them explosions here they're everywhere fire and fire balls tongues of flame crimson and yellow flashes in
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.64 the smoke the time is 0-615 and some 600 marines are about to be launched or rather launch
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:37.40 themselves at basio codenamed Helen i'm at the front of the boat the lieutenant the platoon leader
02:00:37.96 --> 02:00:45.000 time for me to lead a few seconds go by i was a few seconds ago i was deploying the limited
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.60 protection offered by the thin metal ramp now i'm deploying the lack of that limited protection
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:58.12 it was after all better than nothing which is what i've got now i kind of feel sick and i'm thinking
02:00:58.12 --> 02:01:03.24 god why am i in this mess what am i doing here but i'm resigned to the situation i've got to
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:12.12 write it out no matter what happens no turning back now so the ramp hits the water and i run down
02:01:12.12 --> 02:01:17.40 the ramp clutching my m1 carbine waving my guys forward shouting let's go i sense that my
02:01:17.40 --> 02:01:21.72 manner hesitating by the pain no attention to them i jump into the water not knowing how deep it'll
02:01:21.72 --> 02:01:27.24 be thinking that i might jump into a shell hole and go all the way under but i land on coral and sand
02:01:27.24 --> 02:01:32.68 solid footing that's only five deep water relief and the water feels good that incredibly is my
02:01:32.68 --> 02:01:38.28 first thought the water feels good it's calm and warm like bath water almost soothing a pleasant
02:01:38.28 --> 02:01:44.12 contrast to the still cool morning air it's murky though sand and coral all stirred up beneath the
02:01:44.12 --> 02:01:50.12 surface none of that crystalline purity that comes to mind when you picture a tropical lagoon
02:01:50.12 --> 02:01:59.64 war comes to paradise and literally fouls it up i look sure word only 600 yards to go
02:01:59.64 --> 02:02:13.56 now the fellow that reached down and pulled me up over the ramp here a few months ago
02:02:15.56 --> 02:02:23.96 we ran across a photograph of him and what did it look like and a little bit of reference to
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:31.80 his family but never never made a contact now this is as of within six months or so ago
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:40.76 so this is and nobody and nobody else i talked to really knew who this guy was he was new to the
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:46.92 outfit he was the sergeant he was new so but nobody knew him at reunions didn't know him
02:02:46.92 --> 02:02:55.96 so you look out there's six hundred and he and he and I were being lifted up by the
02:02:55.96 --> 02:03:03.96 by the transport and a bat sabisid and a basket and remote and says it just as we were okay
02:03:03.96 --> 02:03:12.60 just about up from the landing boat and in this basket taken a reason up to the transport itself
02:03:12.60 --> 02:03:21.08 and i made a comment says looks like looks like we made it his comment was you made it you made it
02:03:22.68 --> 02:03:30.44 and he died so you look down going back to this point when the ramp actually opens and you see you've
02:03:30.44 --> 02:03:37.72 got 600 yards to go and just nothing but machine gun fire and as you said earlier the Japanese
02:03:37.72 --> 02:03:43.96 you'd watch them storm forward without any ability to maneuver just only thing to do with the salt
02:03:43.96 --> 02:03:49.96 and now here you are we are no maneuver in the exact same situation yeah we're in there saving
02:03:49.96 --> 02:03:57.64 in completely at their mercy you say here 600 yards six football fields just under a third of a
02:03:57.64 --> 02:04:03.64 mile if you run that distance on dry land unencumbered and unimposed you'll be gasping at the
02:04:03.64 --> 02:04:07.64 finish line i don't care what kind of shape you're in we're in water and we're wearing and
02:04:07.64 --> 02:04:13.16 carrying 60 pounds or more of gear and the Japanese are ripping us apart they've got an absolutely
02:04:13.16 --> 02:04:19.88 clear field of fire and we have to walk straight into it when i returned and i looked i went
02:04:19.88 --> 02:04:25.56 clear out there where i was hit and walked in and i saw remains of old carbines and so on down in
02:04:25.56 --> 02:04:36.12 the sand we've got a walk not run because we're in the water remember walk slowly because we
02:04:36.12 --> 02:04:42.36 can't run we can't even walk fast the marines are the world's experts in amphibious warfare the
02:04:42.36 --> 02:04:47.32 core has been training for the past two decades to assault an established beach head on a hostile
02:04:47.32 --> 02:04:53.08 shore it has developed complex doctrines to guide us in such endeavors at bayjio on 21 November
02:04:53.08 --> 02:04:59.16 1943 all that training in doctrine doctrine has come to this we step out of our LCVPs into shallow
02:04:59.16 --> 02:05:06.44 water and walk slowly across 600 yards with absolutely no cover whatsoever to make a frontal assault
02:05:06.44 --> 02:05:16.04 on heavily fortified and defended enemy positions on my website just go to it by my name just
02:05:16.04 --> 02:05:23.80 Dean Lad there is a poem in here called curtains of fire and it goes in a great detail similar
02:05:23.80 --> 02:05:31.96 kind of words but done done a little differently and it's so that's where that's where it's all spilled out
02:05:34.60 --> 02:05:38.68 you you say some training in some doctrine that they've been working on that's your quote
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:44.12 we cannot believe the volume of fire that's coming from the island the air is just filled with bullets
02:05:44.12 --> 02:05:50.28 we can't see them but we can see where they hit splat splat splat like raime drops dotting the
02:05:50.28 --> 02:05:56.04 water dot pattern sweeping back and forth across our line curtains a curtain of fire it's called
02:05:56.04 --> 02:06:02.60 curtain of fire passing over us through us yeah I realize oh my god the Japanese have got this
02:06:02.60 --> 02:06:07.72 reef zeroed in which means they don't even have to aim their machine guns they just lock the guns
02:06:07.72 --> 02:06:12.36 to a predetermined setting and traverse the barrel left and right left and right just a lot
02:06:12.36 --> 02:06:19.000 along the reef like shooting a fish in a barrel yeah yeah major haze was right he said we'd be going
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.76 in standing up and that's what we're doing not that we want to there's no other way no place to run
02:06:24.76 --> 02:06:29.16 no place to hide some men crowds in the water they watch the bullet patterns the curtains trying
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:33.48 to figure out when the curtain will sweep over them it's all a matter of timing they'll duck
02:06:33.48 --> 02:06:38.44 under water at the right moment to avoid getting shot it would be a good plan if only there were
02:06:38.44 --> 02:06:42.68 two if only there were one or two machine guns firing at them but there are many many machine
02:06:42.68 --> 02:06:47.64 guns firing creating multiple curtains that meet and intermingle an overlap and crisscross
02:06:47.64 --> 02:06:53.08 yeah bullets are flying every which way worse the guns are aimed to fire just inches above the
02:06:53.08 --> 02:06:58.12 surface so if you crouch with your head just above the water you're likely to get your head drilled
02:06:59.24 --> 02:07:04.28 might as well stand up that way you'll get shot the chest or stomach which is usually fatal
02:07:04.28 --> 02:07:10.76 instead of to the head which is almost always fatal also if you're crouching in the water you're
02:07:10.76 --> 02:07:15.32 not moving and if you're not moving your stationary target and your easier to shoot you have to
02:07:15.32 --> 02:07:21.72 keep moving you have to get to shore get a shore or die and the whole thing orders were don't
02:07:21.72 --> 02:07:29.000 stop to help anybody everybody's going to get killed just you get sure stuff in my man that's
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:36.36 stop to help me violate those orders that told him don't wait for me go on no they they just took
02:07:36.36 --> 02:07:44.04 a stick around walking straight into curtains of machine gun fires not something that comes naturally
02:07:44.84 --> 02:07:51.48 your instinct's oppose it every fiber of your beam being seems screams in protest resisting
02:07:51.48 --> 02:07:57.32 telling you no way it hell am I going to do that that's why when I glance over my shoulder to see
02:07:57.32 --> 02:08:03.000 how my man are doing I see that I haven't that many haven't left the boat a few most likely those
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.60 that are just next to me in the boat are in the water but the others are bunched up at the top of
02:08:06.60 --> 02:08:13.40 the ramp all tensed up to take the plunge but hesitating unable to make themselves move I can't
02:08:13.40 --> 02:08:19.48 blame themselves for hanging back but I can't allow it for one thing they make a big fat target
02:08:19.48 --> 02:08:23.000 standing they're crowded together at the front of the boat they've got to get into the water
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.72 and disperse before the Japanese machine guns find them and wipe them out with a couple well place
02:08:27.72 --> 02:08:32.52 purse but more important they've got a job to do they've got to get off the boat get a sure
02:08:32.52 --> 02:08:37.72 and fight and kill Japanese I gesture them and shout come on guys let's go get moving move out
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:46.36 they obey me they get moving they're good men the best they charge down the ramp jump
02:08:46.36 --> 02:08:51.56 feet first in the water start waiting toward the shore and that's when the slaughter really begins
02:08:51.56 --> 02:08:57.24 right away the men around me my men are taking hits and falling I'm very aware of this
02:08:57.24 --> 02:09:01.72 I'm hearing cries for help cries for corpsmen the wounded are calling out corpsmen corpsmen I'm
02:09:01.72 --> 02:09:06.60 hit I'm hit over here they're calling out as loud as they can I see men going under
02:09:06.60 --> 02:09:13.000 often for the last time what do I do I keep moving forward that's what cries for help everywhere
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.20 and I ignore them I have to you get hot you get hit you just have to keep going you have to
02:09:18.20 --> 02:09:23.40 cope with it yourself do the best you can hope for the best the sounds of battle are everywhere
02:09:24.52 --> 02:09:29.24 there are those sweeping slashing curtains of fire dozens of machine guns rattling a
02:09:29.24 --> 02:09:37.08 a cacophony of staccato hammering artillery shells exploding in the water splashing throwing up
02:09:37.08 --> 02:09:43.72 washing gaizers of water and human body parts and most especially most memory the shouts and
02:09:43.72 --> 02:09:50.28 screams of the wounded in the dying oh god I'm hit corpsmen over here corpsmen help me help me please
02:09:52.20 --> 02:09:56.12 manner dropping everywhere to the left and right me falling and sinking into the water going
02:09:56.12 --> 02:10:01.48 under some men don't cry out hardly make a sound when they're hit the bullet or bullets
02:10:01.48 --> 02:10:06.36 thump into them they grunt and they're gone we're not permitted to help them the corpsmen can
02:10:06.36 --> 02:10:12.68 come to the raid but but not the rest of us our orders are to move on to get to shore as fast as we can
02:10:12.68 --> 02:10:17.56 if we stop the help the wounded will get shot too and we won't make it to the beach where we're
02:10:17.56 --> 02:10:24.12 needed so we keep waiting forward my men my men from other boats the entire battalion what's
02:10:24.12 --> 02:10:28.28 left of it struggling through the water holding the rifles over their heads pushing through
02:10:28.28 --> 02:10:34.28 toward the beach and into the teeth of all that infillating gunfire they're courage is incredible
02:10:34.28 --> 02:10:43.56 that world only begins to describe it insulating from that beach to British transport or ship
02:10:44.52 --> 02:10:52.20 crossfire you guys are it yeah shells exploding washing gaizers machine guns rattling
02:10:52.20 --> 02:10:56.84 splat splat splat those little dots in the water thousands of them moving this way and that
02:10:56.84 --> 02:11:02.36 a bullet hits four feet to my right splat splat then bullets hit three feet two foot one foot to my
02:11:02.36 --> 02:11:07.72 right sure do hope they skip over me and they do this time splat they begin hitting to my left one
02:11:07.72 --> 02:11:13.000 foot two foot three foot and so on I got lucky I literally dodged the bullet several bullets how
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:18.76 long will my luck hold I can't see any muzzle flashes from the enemy guns the Japanese are invisible
02:11:18.76 --> 02:11:25.48 just like their bullets we're being slaughtered by an invisible force nothing to see nothing to shoot at
02:11:25.48 --> 02:11:29.72 not that we would be shooting if we could see them you don't stand an open water shooting at the
02:11:29.72 --> 02:11:34.44 enemy you get yourself to the beach you take cover and then you start shooting anyway my weapon
02:11:34.44 --> 02:11:40.04 isn't good for shooting at long and medium ranges for that matter it's not much good at close range
02:11:40.04 --> 02:11:45.16 either it's an m1 carbine a pathetic excuse for a fire arm a weakling with a weakling punch
02:11:46.04 --> 02:11:50.28 I'm holding it at port arms across my chest as I weigh through the water maybe there'll be a stop
02:11:50.28 --> 02:11:55.80 maybe there'll be a maybe it will stop a bullet that would otherwise kill me that's about all the
02:11:55.80 --> 02:12:01.96 good it can do me I walk on pushing forward straining to move faster the water drag me at my thighs
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:09.000 no one ever said a speed rucker record running in five deep water I've gone about 100 yards only
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:15.64 500 yards to go we're taking fire from the front from both flanks from the rear
02:12:17.80 --> 02:12:21.88 the rear what the hell and that's what you talk about that's the that's the uh
02:12:21.88 --> 02:12:27.72 uh sunken ship that's out there and there's well no no there are planes here now our planes
02:12:27.72 --> 02:12:32.36 are coming in and strapping and we wonder what is going on of this when they were they were
02:12:32.36 --> 02:12:41.08 strapping that ship I returned to the task at hand keep moving to the shore how long has
02:12:41.08 --> 02:12:45.56 this been going on how long have been out here in the water I can't say I have no sense of time
02:12:45.56 --> 02:12:50.60 everything is moving in slow motion second seems to last minutes minute seemed to last hours
02:12:50.60 --> 02:12:56.04 it just keeps going on and on every moment is intense filled with intense thoughts emotions actions
02:12:56.04 --> 02:13:01.000 I'm thinking how can I protect myself how can I protect my men someone screams another one of my
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.84 men is hit and another and another help corpsman some are killed outright some are wounded
02:13:06.84 --> 02:13:12.20 some are well it's hard to say some go quietly some noisely they fall back in the water they
02:13:12.20 --> 02:13:16.60 slip onto the water some flail in the water and they're paying in panic howling and shouting
02:13:16.60 --> 02:13:22.12 I keep moving my adrenaline is flowing like an electric current through me allowing me to do things
02:13:22.12 --> 02:13:27.08 I wouldn't normally and shouldn't normally do if I stop to think about what I'm doing I'd freeze up
02:13:27.08 --> 02:13:32.44 I try to track the bullets the movement in patterns of the enemy's traversing fire the bullets
02:13:32.44 --> 02:13:37.24 impact start to my left to my right the bullets sweeping back and forth I see no pattern
02:13:37.24 --> 02:13:41.96 or rather I see too many patterns splat splat splat everywhere it's like the enemy throwing
02:13:41.96 --> 02:13:47.24 thousands and thousands of stones at us a pattern of splats in the water comes towards me from the right
02:13:47.24 --> 02:13:51.32 sweeps pass me continue to the left I don't hear the crack of the bullets as they zip by
02:13:51.32 --> 02:13:56.04 its supersonic speed that's the problem they're not zipping past us they're hitting us they've got
02:13:56.04 --> 02:14:00.84 our range I'm in the impact zone I have to get through it or die I turned to look back at my
02:14:00.84 --> 02:14:07.16 men let's go I call out for the umpteenth time I turn facing this shore then finally it happens
02:14:07.16 --> 02:14:14.44 a sickening splat like an inner tube being snapped across my abdomen slapping my bare stomach a sharp
02:14:14.44 --> 02:14:20.92 staying sensation I'm hit I hear myself say a bullet is struck me nearly dead center below the
02:14:20.92 --> 02:14:28.20 naval piercing me above the water line I'm gut shot one of the worst wounds of all oh god
02:14:28.20 --> 02:14:37.24 I've probably been hit by small caliber machine gun bullet fired from straight ahead on the beach
02:14:37.24 --> 02:14:41.40 it didn't make much of an impact not long enough to knock me off my feet or even stagger me
02:14:41.40 --> 02:14:46.44 later I would learn to tour right through my body piercing my intestines later and goodness it didn't
02:14:46.44 --> 02:14:55.48 hit a bone yeah so it pierced your intestines bladder and sacrum just before that
02:14:55.48 --> 02:15:04.60 and an exited missing my spinal nerve by a quarter of an inch as it is I'll probably
02:15:04.60 --> 02:15:11.24 die in a few minutes I'm scared I think my gosh this is it if it happens that you get shot
02:15:11.24 --> 02:15:14.84 and you don't know how bad the wound it often happens that you get shot you don't know how bad
02:15:14.84 --> 02:15:20.84 the wound is but when you're hit where I was hit you know it's bad it's a gut wound and you
02:15:20.84 --> 02:15:26.12 know it's pretty sure thing you're not going to make it very few people survive gut wounds even in the
02:15:26.12 --> 02:15:33.24 best of circumstances I'm in what are arguably the worst of circumstances if I had been shot on
02:15:33.24 --> 02:15:38.28 try land I might be able to crawl to an aid station or my buddies might have passed me up but I'm
02:15:38.28 --> 02:15:43.80 in a lagoon so there can be no crawling and my buddies are forbidden to help me it goes without saying
02:15:43.80 --> 02:15:49.24 that there are no aid stations close by I can try to reach our LCVPs on the reef a hundred yards
02:15:49.24 --> 02:15:57.000 behind me but I probably won't make it I'm dying is why I don't my gear into the water off goes my
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:02.04 pack my helmet my webbing the walkie talkie slung over my shoulder goodbye m1 carbine into the drink
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:07.96 you go never shot fired an anger it takes just seconds for me to shock my equipment in those seconds
02:16:07.96 --> 02:16:13.24 I lose most of my strength after a few more seconds I'm almost too weak to stand it happens that
02:16:13.24 --> 02:16:18.68 fast the energy is draining out of me I'm going into shock the weakness doesn't paralyze me and it
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:23.08 doesn't come from any place in particular it's an overall sort of feeling that makes me go heavy and
02:16:23.08 --> 02:16:29.08 limp I'm in pain but it's not too bad not yet and I'm not bleeding very much either but I'm
02:16:29.08 --> 02:16:35.000 slipping away no doubt about it my biggest worry now is that I'll collapse sink beneath the surface
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.68 and drown all I want to do is keep my head above water so I won't drown before I die from
02:16:40.68 --> 02:16:45.88 the bullet that reamed through me I know this isn't rational what differences and make how I die
02:16:45.88 --> 02:16:50.60 drowning or dying from getting my inner scrambled by a bullet either way I'm a garner and soon
02:16:51.48 --> 02:16:57.16 but I'm not thinking rationally I'm thinking I've got to keep my head above water period maybe
02:16:57.16 --> 02:17:03.16 10 seconds have passed since I got shot that is all in that time the man close to me
02:17:03.16 --> 02:17:09.08 PFC Thomas F Sullivan has hastened to my side Lieutenant where are you hitting ass I tell him he pulls
02:17:09.08 --> 02:17:16.68 up my Dungary jacket checks my wound so long as the puttons eight ball a nice guy just a teenager
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:20.84 but he's got a wild streak he's always getting in a trouble you can bet dollars to donuts when
02:17:20.84 --> 02:17:25.64 he goes on liberty he lays the dick and gets arrested and afterwards spent a few days in the
02:17:25.64 --> 02:17:31.48 brig is punishment this happened in New Zealand before we left for Tarrawer this happens everywhere
02:17:31.48 --> 02:17:37.56 we go it's standard operating procedure for Sullivan you can put you can count on him to kick
02:17:37.56 --> 02:17:43.88 up a road to put him in low key to mat for is I try to never good I know he survives a war oh
02:17:43.88 --> 02:17:49.24 he definitely survives yeah and you're happy that right now he's the kind of guy that's rebellious
02:17:49.24 --> 02:17:54.68 because he's dope diso-bang the orders which the orders are you keep going and he looks at you and
02:17:54.68 --> 02:18:00.44 says no you know I thought as I got her so why why have somebody else die trying to help me
02:18:00.44 --> 02:18:09.56 another guy joins him pft. Duffy also remember my petute and also with Tima Kiddoo does know how to
02:18:09.56 --> 02:18:16.84 fall. When I returned this last time I found out where he was buried. Duffy yeah yeah
02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000 and you even say you'd think you'd be happy that these guys were staying with you but you're actually
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:30.60 thinking which is what they were disobeying orders and they were gonna lose their lives too.
02:18:32.36 --> 02:18:36.20 And finally they say we're staying with you where do you want us to take you to the beach or to the
02:18:36.20 --> 02:18:44.36 boat and you opt for the boat. Yeah. It takes about 10 minutes to reach the nearest LCVP.
02:18:45.64 --> 02:18:50.36 The boats crowded with other wounded Marines other wounded men are being dragged to the boat by their
02:18:50.36 --> 02:18:55.32 buddies. Evidently Sullivan and Duffy weren't the only one to ignore the order to ignore the wounded.
02:18:55.32 --> 02:19:01.80 The wounded men and the rescuers are clustered in front of the ramp which is about three quarters
02:19:01.80 --> 02:19:06.76 raised. One by one the wounded men are half pushed half flung over the top of the ramp after which
02:19:06.76 --> 02:19:11.40 they rolled down onto the deck my turn comes. The man next to me is that big fellow with the
02:19:11.40 --> 02:19:17.96 ravaged face. His wounded is terrible worse than mine. I motion for him to go before me. He is boosted
02:19:17.96 --> 02:19:22.52 up to the top of the ramp. Sullivan lifts me up. I'm groaning like mad. The pain is getting worse.
02:19:22.52 --> 02:19:27.96 I'm really hurting really bad now. My helpers can't quite get me over the top. I'm limp and heavy.
02:19:27.96 --> 02:19:33.24 A bulky sack of flesh and bone with a hole in it and they just can't manage to raise me high enough.
02:19:33.24 --> 02:19:39.32 That's when the Marine with the ravaged face performs his life saving deed. One army me into the boat.
02:19:40.68 --> 02:19:45.32 How did he do that? He must be in torment from his wound but that didn't stop him from helping me.
02:19:45.32 --> 02:19:52.28 I tumble groaning down onto the dock alongside the man with the ravaged face. The deck is covered
02:19:52.28 --> 02:19:57.56 with the main and wounded men. Their bodies bandages and bloody many writhing and pain.
02:19:57.56 --> 02:20:02.76 Many just groaning just like me. Another wounded man is taking aboard. The ramp is then
02:20:02.76 --> 02:20:07.56 closed and the boat begins to move. The coxon aware that our lives are hanging. The balance
02:20:07.56 --> 02:20:13.88 opens. The throttle wide and soon we're going full tilt racing through the channel in the barrier
02:20:13.88 --> 02:20:23.000 reef toward the Sheridan. This description I think is the best description I've ever heard of
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.92 of that kind of combat. Well, yeah you take a scene of small line. Your line burger is
02:20:29.64 --> 02:20:34.28 he's increasing credible. He does a lot of writing. He worked with
02:20:35.32 --> 02:20:42.44 a guy handed up the Chicago Tribune. He worked with him regarding the army unit that was
02:20:42.44 --> 02:20:50.76 in more or more too. Then he wrote this about the Polish woman that was in the Jewish woman.
02:20:51.40 --> 02:21:00.84 That was survived the time that they were almost killed. It's incredible.
02:21:00.84 --> 02:21:14.20 That's the end of the tunnel of battle for you. Lasted what? 20 minutes? I guess 20 hours
02:21:14.20 --> 02:21:20.68 in 20 minutes because you did the first 20 hours circle around. You give a great account
02:21:21.24 --> 02:21:25.56 from all the people that were there that got interviewed.
02:21:25.56 --> 02:21:36.76 The next time he's pushing in the fighting at taro. It's really all taking place at this sea wall.
02:21:36.76 --> 02:21:47.32 Later on, later on he was in the motorcycle officer in the LA. He's been in accidents and
02:21:47.32 --> 02:22:02.60 shot at it. He hospitalized 20 times. Oh my gosh. Yeah, these guys getting a sure a few
02:22:02.60 --> 02:22:08.28 seconds later, dick steps a sure. This is what you're being loaded down the Sheraton.
02:22:08.28 --> 02:22:12.36 Yes. Momently loaded. He said to himself, well, they ain't going to give me now.
02:22:12.36 --> 02:22:18.44 Then he looked around in his elation evaporated nearby, led dead marine with a Japanese bayonet
02:22:18.44 --> 02:22:22.92 protruding from his chest and three dead Japanese soldiers sprawled around him. Dead bodies were
02:22:22.92 --> 02:22:26.68 everywhere floating in the water, piling up at the waterline, strewn about the beach.
02:22:26.68 --> 02:22:30.92 Guys from the second marine to a landed the day before. Guys from the eighth marine's too.
02:22:30.92 --> 02:22:35.96 And many Japanese, the beach was strewn with rifles as well as bodies and he took one off of the
02:22:35.96 --> 02:22:43.80 dead marine and took the man's ammo clips as well. Now he could fight back. And then another
02:22:43.80 --> 02:22:48.12 guy named Hester, Hester, collected his men and led them back to the sea wall. They found the perfect
02:22:48.12 --> 02:22:54.84 example of taking leadership. This Hester called Big Hester. What happened with him? Well,
02:22:54.84 --> 02:23:02.92 he's able to gather people together and they let go. That's the guy is not how much
02:23:02.92 --> 02:23:08.60 it's on Mars. I say about him. I mean, there were two brothers. One brother was killed. His younger
02:23:08.60 --> 02:23:16.04 brother was killed on Guadalcanel, but the time when I was killed. Well, you start talking here
02:23:16.04 --> 02:23:23.08 about him and Hester and then Murdoch. Yeah. And he said, Hester, they found Murdoch near a wrecked
02:23:23.08 --> 02:23:27.72 damn track in the mad rush to reach the sea wall and jump over it. Duffy somehow got separated
02:23:27.72 --> 02:23:32.36 from the group and they never saw him again. Never saw him. He was killed. The guy that saved
02:23:32.36 --> 02:23:36.44 your life sitting with his back the wall taking a breather dick looked over the cord the shore
02:23:36.44 --> 02:23:41.08 immediately behind Murdoch. The incoming waves washed the dead marines onto the shore and pushed
02:23:41.08 --> 02:23:45.000 them into small piles. It looked like a little mound and at the top of that mound facing the
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:48.76 sky was Anthony Boyle. His helmet was off in the top of his head. He was shot on the ground.
02:23:48.76 --> 02:23:55.80 On that same oil. A number of years ago, Murdoch, I and another one or two, went to a big
02:23:55.80 --> 02:24:04.12 memorial for him in New York. Overlooking the Hudson. And we had one Lieutenant General
02:24:04.84 --> 02:24:13.000 Boomer was with us and he was one of the spokesman for the fighting in the jury involved in.
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:21.64 He was a guy and the main guy. So he was there with us. But we had a big ceremony in a big
02:24:21.64 --> 02:24:30.12 Catholic church. We had a parade downtown. So the downtown was a big event. And this is what
02:24:30.12 --> 02:24:37.88 happened to him. That's what happened to him. Is. Yeah. Only seconds before Oboil had been standing
02:24:37.88 --> 02:24:42.20 next to Murdoch period over the world. Then a Japanese bullet took off the top of his head and he fell
02:24:42.20 --> 02:24:47.48 back into John's arm. John created Oboil in his arms for a long moment before laying him gently
02:24:47.48 --> 02:24:52.52 aside. Someone else must have hauled him up to the pile of bodies at the water's edge to get away
02:24:52.52 --> 02:24:57.72 from the wall. During this time, someone from the company passed Dick's position and informed
02:24:57.72 --> 02:25:01.72 that Duffy had been killed. Duffy was a very quiet person. Never talked to him much, but it really
02:25:01.72 --> 02:25:09.56 nice to hear. Dick remembered. He was a little older than the most of us in his earlier mid-20s,
02:25:09.56 --> 02:25:15.16 which made him an old man in our outfit. He was Oboil's best buddy. Now they were both dead
02:25:15.16 --> 02:25:27.000 killed within minutes of each other. For everyone involved Americans, Japanese, there's a peculiar,
02:25:27.80 --> 02:25:31.96 peculiar nasty way to fight a war. The situation favored the defenders, but only two
02:25:31.96 --> 02:25:36.84 appoint battles are won, not by staying in fortifications that are won by attacking. And on
02:25:36.84 --> 02:25:41.64 Baygio, the Marines, we never saw the enemy. Because they were there soon, he had to hear from
02:25:41.64 --> 02:25:47.96 a, from a whole out of a hole somewhere. They had to assault each and every Japanese position,
02:25:47.96 --> 02:25:52.84 making short rushes across open ground through murderous fire. Heavy casualties were the result,
02:25:52.84 --> 02:25:58.60 but ultimately, Japanese casualties were heavier. In fact, almost total. The Japanese would not yield
02:25:58.60 --> 02:26:03.72 because their military ethos forbade it to beat them. You had to kill them. But the Marines
02:26:03.72 --> 02:26:09.000 would not quit, and they could not be stopped. Against the foes, such as the Marines with their
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.60 absolute determination and capability to win, the initial advantages enjoyed by defenders fighting
02:26:14.60 --> 02:26:21.08 from a concealment could have won outcome. A annihilation. Now I have a, I have a book here written
02:26:21.08 --> 02:26:29.64 by one of the Japanese defenders. And I wanted to meet him when I went there and met two other
02:26:29.64 --> 02:26:35.24 Japanese officers. But we never, we never, we never actually able to get together. We were on a
02:26:35.24 --> 02:26:43.32 phone. But the name, the name we were called, I'll see what they called, called Heavenly,
02:26:44.28 --> 02:26:50.04 something rather. They believed that I went to a heaven too. There's a different kind of heaven.
02:26:50.84 --> 02:26:59.40 And they died. Continuant all of this. Yes, yes, a coney shrine for one place.
02:26:59.40 --> 02:27:04.60 OK. You know, the officers, especially, we will be again in the S. Coney shrine.
02:27:05.32 --> 02:27:10.84 And this one officer that I met on Guadalconeo and who I got in a real well, we
02:27:10.84 --> 02:27:21.08 we of course, minor for about 15 years. And talked a lot about the, I learned a lot about their,
02:27:21.88 --> 02:27:25.72 their whole background of their Bouchito code. No, let's talk.
02:27:25.72 --> 02:27:32.12 I've read on this podcast. I've read some of letters that the Kamakaze pilots would write.
02:27:32.12 --> 02:27:36.84 Because they would write a letter before they would go and die. Yeah. And, and there's also,
02:27:37.88 --> 02:27:44.92 there's also talk of how like they would write these letters. But some of them were not writing
02:27:44.92 --> 02:27:50.28 from the heart. Yeah, what? And as they, when they, when they die, sometimes they would cut off their fingernails.
02:27:50.28 --> 02:27:55.96 And that would be sent back. Now, this one, this one, one fellow who had just been killed,
02:27:55.96 --> 02:28:01.40 he was in a go for like hole, who just starting our final drive. And that's where I,
02:28:01.40 --> 02:28:08.36 I got the diary from him and the thousand, whole, a stitched belt. And all that kind of stuff.
02:28:08.36 --> 02:28:19.80 And anyway, I had the, I had a little, little piece of part of a hair that had long to
02:28:21.40 --> 02:28:26.04 think and long to his, his girlfriend or something. Anyway, I just want to send all that back.
02:28:27.08 --> 02:28:33.96 And that, when, when the, when the soldier was killed, the life, and that would have been his wife.
02:28:33.96 --> 02:28:39.96 The wife is supposed to take care of his family. Instead, she had remarried. She felt bad about it.
02:28:39.96 --> 02:28:45.64 When she saw this, saw what he had written, but one of her remarried. What did you understand me?
02:28:45.64 --> 02:28:47.24 Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
02:28:52.92 --> 02:28:59.40 Again, jumping ahead a little bit, because people need to get the books, they can read it for themselves.
02:28:59.40 --> 02:29:03.24 But the casually told was nothing less than catastrophic. The New Zealand, the company,
02:29:03.24 --> 02:29:07.64 had been beefed up into a little more than 200 men to give it an extra punch in the assault.
02:29:07.64 --> 02:29:13.000 90 were lost, killed, or wounded in the Bayesian Lagoon. In other words, nearly half the company was
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.56 out of action before anyone stepped ashore. The men Murdoch found on the beach were all exhausted.
02:29:19.56 --> 02:29:23.08 And with the terrible look on their face, that's according to Murdoch. But their shocking
02:29:23.08 --> 02:29:27.96 exhaust did not could not concern him. What I was more interested in was who's alive and who I
02:29:27.96 --> 02:29:34.04 have I got. What have I got? To make that assessment, he continued rounding up the guys in the beach
02:29:34.04 --> 02:29:35.96 and taking them back to his area.
02:29:41.24 --> 02:29:44.76 All the wild Vietnamese fire was flailing on the beach, John ignored it. When Anthony
02:29:44.76 --> 02:29:49.80 Oboil was shot and fell into his arms, he wasn't faced. And once he laid Oboil,
02:29:49.80 --> 02:29:54.60 Oboil's twitching body aside, he didn't think about him anymore that day. He didn't have time,
02:29:54.60 --> 02:29:58.76 much less the inclination to grieve for Oboil or to feel horror for the slow,
02:29:58.76 --> 02:30:04.76 hideous way of all of that. See at that point of time, our battalion, especially our company,
02:30:05.48 --> 02:30:14.76 led by Murdoch, were wiping out the last resistance. It was a hard, it was really a
02:30:16.36 --> 02:30:21.000 real determined group fighting there. And that's where we lost right now. One of the people
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.92 that's in this picture here, he got shot by fellow down in a hole like a little spider hole
02:30:26.92 --> 02:30:32.44 where he caught. And up in his gut killed him instantly. He died thinking that he died, thinking that
02:30:32.44 --> 02:30:43.000 I'd be just been killed. I visit his family in Tennessee afterwards and they were still so sad that
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:52.68 they didn't even want to hear more about it. Didn't even want to talk to me about it. Progress is
02:30:52.68 --> 02:30:56.76 eventually made toward the middle of the day, Bill noticed that seems things seem to be going a
02:30:56.76 --> 02:31:00.84 little bit better for the Marines. They seem to be making some progress. Bulldozers had landed by
02:31:00.84 --> 02:31:06.20 that. And they pushed up against the pillbox entrances, sealing them and intuming the Japanese
02:31:06.20 --> 02:31:11.000 inside. But the flame throwers really did the trick. A flame thrower on. So one of those
02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:18.44 that was inside, I ran into the first time returned, first time I returned to Terala. And he had been
02:31:18.44 --> 02:31:25.32 been in the Navy for many, many years, probably a little over 20 years. And he was in charge of the
02:31:25.32 --> 02:31:33.80 mess area. And then he had been transferred from there to New Guinea just before we landed. That's
02:31:33.80 --> 02:31:39.64 why how he survived. Oh, so he so just before he landed, he had been transferred. Yeah, he had been
02:31:39.64 --> 02:31:44.12 gone. Well, he, you know, maybe a month before some period of time. Right, right. That's the only
02:31:44.12 --> 02:31:49.48 reason. So he wrote that. So now here he is, he returned, same time, I'm idea, and I met him,
02:31:49.48 --> 02:31:56.68 you know. And I showed him the picture of the one, the one, the Japanese soldier that, what they
02:31:56.68 --> 02:32:02.52 do with they put, they put their toll in the, and pull the trigger of the rifle, and point
02:32:02.52 --> 02:32:08.76 it right up there, I've got him out. And he was doing that. And he saw that. And he, the reaction
02:32:08.76 --> 02:32:13.08 from there was already something. It was for you something. And he saw that picture, he says, yeah.
02:32:14.12 --> 02:32:27.88 Yeah, there's been a lot. Man. Here's what here's what Murdoch says as the, as the fighting kind of comes to
02:32:27.88 --> 02:32:33.96 an end. As they get to the end, all of a sudden things began to move. We were moving, but very,
02:32:33.96 --> 02:32:38.12 very slowly like a snail. My guys would go out ahead of me. Then they'd be moving and I'd run up
02:32:38.12 --> 02:32:43.64 with my gang and get behind them. We were all very close. The enemy, a matter of feet, not yards. It
02:32:43.64 --> 02:32:48.36 was small, very slow progress. But it was progress nonetheless. For the first time since they landed
02:32:48.36 --> 02:32:53.24 the day before, the men of B company were advancing and not falling back after each forward push.
02:32:53.24 --> 02:32:57.80 The Japanese meant to fight to the last man, and they were coming ever closer to realizing that
02:32:57.80 --> 02:33:02.84 goal. Marine assault teams mostly add hawk assemblages, destroyed the enemy bunkers one after
02:33:02.84 --> 02:33:07.72 another, killing the Japanese while they're inside, or when they ran out, the Japanese were
02:33:07.72 --> 02:33:12.68 literally slain in heaps, as their numbers were reduced, so as the volume and intensity of their
02:33:12.68 --> 02:33:18.04 fire. Finally, when John and his men in advance as far as they could, the battle just sort of
02:33:18.04 --> 02:33:22.76 Petered out. The shooting stopped bringing silence to their sector of the battlefield and leaving
02:33:22.76 --> 02:33:28.52 everyone stunned by the abrupt end to the fighting. They didn't know quite what to do, we just kind of
02:33:28.52 --> 02:33:37.16 sat there and did nothing. The next day, first battalion marched over to the pier where the LCVB
02:33:37.16 --> 02:33:44.60 waited to take them back to the Sheridan. On their way, they witnessed a dual flag raising ceremony
02:33:44.60 --> 02:33:48.84 for the stars and stripes in the British Union Jack with a representative from his Majesty's
02:33:48.84 --> 02:33:53.88 government presiding. The stars and stripes went up first, but the Union Jack was given the place
02:33:53.88 --> 02:33:58.76 of pride and honor on a higher pole and acknowledgement of the British sovereignty over the Taroa
02:33:58.76 --> 02:34:03.64 toll. There were some muddled complaints for the men of the one eight, but not much.
02:34:03.64 --> 02:34:10.28 Most just smiled grimly and shook their heads. Great Britain may have held the title to Bejio,
02:34:10.92 --> 02:34:14.68 but the Marine Corps truly owned it. Well, I recurrent the first time.
02:34:14.68 --> 02:34:27.40 I recurrent the first time in 82 and I stayed with missionaries there for a couple of days or more.
02:34:27.40 --> 02:34:36.52 Then during that time, we all decided to, okay, there was the breakaway and that church group.
02:34:37.16 --> 02:34:44.28 Part of it is going to another church just a thatch type of a place and walking hand walk through
02:34:44.28 --> 02:34:56.04 some kind of a jungle area to get there. They had it, we sat down and I spoke and asked him to
02:34:56.04 --> 02:35:01.40 sing and they just loved to sing. And then it's not, you got to sing the Marine Hill.
02:35:03.32 --> 02:35:12.12 Then what happened was I didn't really sing it. I said, now we'll sing it. The words, I mean,
02:35:12.12 --> 02:35:25.56 we'll sing the tune of it. It was a love song based on a hymn. It was kind of two iterations of
02:35:25.56 --> 02:35:30.20 apparently and then I had to then I told him a little bit about, well, you know, that's interesting.
02:35:30.76 --> 02:35:34.44 And I said, down, these words and I went through the words to a certain extent.
02:35:38.04 --> 02:35:42.04 Well, that was so interesting. But here they sang that song that was the love song. Like
02:35:42.04 --> 02:35:49.80 same as our Marine Hill. Oh, then after that, I invited him over to the other church that they
02:35:49.80 --> 02:35:57.000 had spent off from and I had got a hold of the film that was done by a government norm hatch.
02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.96 He was recently died away. He's one took all these pictures. Come back photos. It was
02:36:01.96 --> 02:36:11.16 inverted by the way. And anyway, I played that for them and it showed that flag rising and these kids,
02:36:11.40 --> 02:36:17.64 they all scythe and the Marine Hill flag and they were real quiet. The British flag one just like
02:36:17.64 --> 02:36:29.08 was described in here. Here's the results. The battle for Bayesian lasted 76 hours. Some 4,690
02:36:29.08 --> 02:36:36.04 Japanese troops, about 97% of the garrison died. A mere 17 Japanese were taken prisoner
02:36:36.60 --> 02:36:42.60 as were 129 laborers. The second, these most of these were Korean laborers. Yeah. The
02:36:42.60 --> 02:36:49.16 second Marine Division suffered 3,407 casualties of these 1,150 Marines and sailors were killed
02:36:49.16 --> 02:36:56.28 in another 2,292 were wounded. These Salt units lost 41% of their men dead and wounded.
02:36:56.92 --> 02:37:01.64 The first Patanian 8th Marines lost more than 30% of its men just getting to the beach.
02:37:02.76 --> 02:37:06.36 There's probably, there could be as many as 400 still there. Three or 400,
02:37:06.36 --> 02:37:13.80 still there, because they're under homes under park and lots and so on. Overall, the battalion suffered
02:37:13.80 --> 02:37:22.36 343 casualties on their naked. When I was there, the third time. And here the archaeologist
02:37:22.36 --> 02:37:30.36 was brushing about brushing off the bones and on this one person, no, that and two of the two of them
02:37:30.36 --> 02:37:37.88 they found wedding rings on their, something huh? And I saw that as they were doing it. Yeah.
02:37:40.28 --> 02:37:46.20 casualties in my platoon were 12 killed and 15 wounded, including myself 75% of its original
02:37:46.20 --> 02:37:57.08 strength, most were hit while waiting to shore. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And you can look at the faces of all
02:37:57.08 --> 02:38:04.44 these that were killed in this one photograph. And you talk about the news clipping,
02:38:04.44 --> 02:38:10.12 sort of the news stories that were reported about Taram. Yeah. Okay. And part of it, I always was told
02:38:11.40 --> 02:38:16.44 that they released some of these, it was the first time that they really released a lot of
02:38:16.44 --> 02:38:21.08 events. It's a very, very long one that one that general public realized, you know, this is not going
02:38:21.08 --> 02:38:29.56 to be easy. This is what it's really like. Just terrific combat photos, home and credible.
02:38:29.56 --> 02:38:34.76 Yeah. And those were the first ones showing mass casualties in my arrogance. Yeah. You, you've
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:39.24 probably seen that one. Oh, yeah, I've seen it. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, Norm Hatch. Just wanted to do that.
02:38:39.24 --> 02:38:44.84 Oh, so that is him. Okay. Norm Hatch. Oh, yeah. I got no real well. Yeah.
02:38:44.84 --> 02:38:52.84 All right. And in the end, we just read this book, I published, was there's a Colonel Alexander,
02:38:52.84 --> 02:38:59.16 Joseph Alexander died the last, in the last year for years. Anyway, he was the, he was the
02:38:59.96 --> 02:39:07.08 prime historian for the Marine Corps. And, and then he was very well thought of
02:39:07.08 --> 02:39:14.68 the name of the list to press. So when it came to making a proposal to enable us to press,
02:39:14.68 --> 02:39:22.76 it had to go through their, uh, through their border review scene. And then after that, no, I
02:39:22.76 --> 02:39:27.24 seen that. It had to go through, it had to go through your, when it, what's the word for it?
02:39:27.96 --> 02:39:33.88 Somebody has the same, same mountain as you do. I pretty much, anyway, this Joseph Alexander
02:39:33.88 --> 02:39:39.24 was one of the prime ones that did, did, did it when my peer review. Okay. And then when that,
02:39:39.24 --> 02:39:47.80 so that when that got to the, to the review board, oh, he says, fine. So I'd just say,
02:39:47.80 --> 02:39:54.68 you're laying on through, you know. And then now, my book was on the first ones to go on as
02:39:54.68 --> 02:40:02.36 an ebook, first ones for the press. And I have the ads or some of the, the, the, the proceeds magazine.
02:40:02.36 --> 02:40:08.76 Yeah. That shows, shows that they're displayed. One of them is with, uh, with Papay going to,
02:40:08.76 --> 02:40:13.32 is on that same page with him. Well, yeah, this is available on ebook for those of you that
02:40:13.32 --> 02:40:17.40 want to get it, and can't wait to get it. You get immediately. Just go straight to ebook.
02:40:17.40 --> 02:40:21.80 Not only that. Yeah, that too. And not only that. When they go through, and it goes through, and it
02:40:21.80 --> 02:40:29.56 goes up, going through email, I read to, uh, what's, what is it, uh, Amazon.com. It'll be delivery,
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:34.84 you know, matter about three days or less. And, and, and, no, no shipping costs.
02:40:35.64 --> 02:40:42.04 Yeah, that's the way Amazon works. Oh, it's an amazing deal. I do. I don't understand. Yeah. And,
02:40:42.04 --> 02:40:49.32 I don't know if there's, there's, but that's where I got my copies. So, yeah, you can get, I have
02:40:49.32 --> 02:40:53.56 the hardcover and the softcover. Yeah, both. Yes. I don't play around with the music. You know,
02:40:53.56 --> 02:41:00.36 when you get ebooks, they cost three versus three quarters of much as a, uh, one of those. Yeah.
02:41:01.40 --> 02:41:09.64 That's, the publishing world is very strange. Taking it now to where you get onto the
02:41:09.64 --> 02:41:14.92 Sheridan. So now this is, this is, uh, no sooner than my stretcher touched down on the Sheridan's deck
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:19.56 that I was west away into the operating room. I was one of the first wounded marines to be treated
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:23.80 and the medical team was fresh and rested and ready to go to work on me. I guess that qualifies as
02:41:23.80 --> 02:41:29.64 a stroke of good luck. Even better fortunate awaited me in the operating room in the form of
02:41:29.64 --> 02:41:36.84 lieutenant commander Lloyd Sussex formally an abdominal, an abdominal specialist at the Mayo Clinic.
02:41:37.88 --> 02:41:41.32 Now the key member of three-man team, Dr. Two doctors in a corpsman that would say,
02:41:41.32 --> 02:41:45.72 there you go. How lucky is that you had a guy. Unbelievable. And, I'm part of the shift.
02:41:45.72 --> 02:41:52.92 And that's all there was. And if I gone unsure, I would have died. And most other places you,
02:41:52.92 --> 02:41:57.56 you wouldn't have an abdominal specialist. And then it says the operation last about an hour.
02:41:57.56 --> 02:42:01.16 I was conscious the whole time and didn't feel any pain. No, they didn't want their put me out because
02:42:01.16 --> 02:42:07.64 I died. I was in shock. And the doctor spent most of that hour bent over my lower body.
02:42:08.04 --> 02:42:10.84 And although I could not see what they were doing, I could hear a little clicking and
02:42:10.84 --> 02:42:15.24 sniffing sounds made by their instruments as they worked. They repaired my bladder and removed
02:42:15.24 --> 02:42:19.56 a portion of my large intestine and gave me a blood transfusion. Then they closed my wound and that was
02:42:19.56 --> 02:42:25.16 that. Yeah, and didn't need a half of a bay of afterwards. I had made it through surgery. But
02:42:25.16 --> 02:42:29.88 he'd been a close call. Dr. Sussex told me that I could not have survived another two hours
02:42:29.88 --> 02:42:33.64 because of the toxins that were building up inside. And that right after the right after the
02:42:33.64 --> 02:42:40.76 operation I was kept in a hot, covered tent. And it was miserable. I kept trying to shove it off
02:42:40.76 --> 02:42:45.16 they had they had a carman sitting there with me all night long to keep me even throwing it off.
02:42:46.76 --> 02:42:51.48 And then another couple of days I was able to walk into the watch and move me with their
02:42:51.48 --> 02:42:55.48 blood. People couldn't be here. I was walking in there to see the movie. They couldn't believe it.
02:42:55.48 --> 02:43:00.76 I mean you were as good as dad. Got shot in. Unbelievable. Not even to the beach yet.
02:43:00.76 --> 02:43:07.64 Yeah, they had very people survive period. I got shot. Very few. Because he told me he said
02:43:07.64 --> 02:43:13.80 I talked to him later and said, yeah, you know the poison in your system. You wouldn't
02:43:13.80 --> 02:43:19.40 you wouldn't have lasted another couple more. No hour or two that was it. And here's up in an hour
02:43:19.40 --> 02:43:26.04 about an hour or an hour or an hour after I was hit. I was just unbelievable.
02:43:26.04 --> 02:43:31.32 There's unbelievable. You say a few days later I was checked over by a younger doctor, a gloomy
02:43:31.32 --> 02:43:35.40 fellow with a bit with a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a match. You told me don't flu that my wound
02:43:35.40 --> 02:43:40.44 was very serious and that I wouldn't live much past my 50s. Yeah. Well, sort of doctor says such
02:43:40.44 --> 02:43:45.08 that they do his patients. I reported his words to Dr. Soxix, who's who's appalled.
02:43:45.08 --> 02:43:48.68 He shouldn't have told you that. Soxix said and there's no truth through it anyways. And I guess
02:43:48.68 --> 02:43:53.80 we're improving that right now. Soxix, if you're talking about it. Well, now what happened to him?
02:43:54.60 --> 02:43:59.64 A year later he was operating on a guy at Ferregette Naval Training Center. This is Soxix.
02:43:59.64 --> 02:44:04.04 Yes. And here he's about 55 years old. He died of a heart attack. He was
02:44:04.04 --> 02:44:08.28 operating on that guy. And I've talked, I've talked in Mayo Clinic about that. And then
02:44:08.28 --> 02:44:12.68 there's people that are written up a lot of history about that. They written a little bit about
02:44:12.68 --> 02:44:19.40 Sussex. And I gave a lot of information too. But so anyway, that's this end of the story all with him.
02:44:20.76 --> 02:44:24.44 In, uh, lad, like you said, you come walking up their plane of moving.
02:44:24.44 --> 02:44:27.56 Yeah. Yeah. You know, the best that you come walking about up my buddies could hardly prove
02:44:27.56 --> 02:44:30.84 believe their eyes. Oh my god, look, here's lad. They did the exclaimed.
02:44:30.84 --> 02:44:33.80 Yeah. Yeah. First they thought I was dead. Then they were told those grieves he wounded all
02:44:33.80 --> 02:44:38.12 to her up a basket case. And now here I was walking into the movie theater. How many days
02:44:38.12 --> 02:44:46.92 it have been? It couldn't have been more three days. Oh, man. Uh, while I was
02:44:46.92 --> 02:44:50.76 really, you know, all was in a hospital. They must get around. It's fast as possible. Anyway.
02:44:50.76 --> 02:44:55.64 Okay. Yeah. While I was recovering from my surgery, John Murdoch dropped by to give me a
02:44:55.64 --> 02:45:01.000 samurai sword. He had survived. He had proven near to unbezier. Yeah. Hold it from me until I returned.
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.12 He said he assumed that I'd gotten a million dollar wound. It would be sent home. I thought the same.
02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.20 Left unspoken, but implicit and what he said was that he didn't think you'd be coming home.
02:45:12.20 --> 02:45:18.12 The sword was probably mine to keep. Yeah. He was, it was, his was a common sentiment.
02:45:19.24 --> 02:45:23.88 I would venture to say that after Taroa, most second division Marines didn't believe
02:45:23.88 --> 02:45:28.12 they would make it through the war. Yeah. Because you're looking at the entire rest of the island
02:45:28.12 --> 02:45:32.84 campaigns and then you got to go into mainland Japan. And it's going to be a bloody fight the
02:45:32.84 --> 02:45:40.36 whole way. Oh, boy, if they had that bomb had not dropped. It's horrible saying, but gee. Murdoch took
02:45:40.36 --> 02:45:45.24 a head count of B company using a pretty battle roster for reference checking off one name after
02:45:45.24 --> 02:45:51.000 the other from the list. He had known that the toll would be large, but even he was shocked by the
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.88 final count. My god, he thought. Now that the chasms are listed or they're listed in there.
02:45:56.68 --> 02:46:01.08 We've not there listed. They're listed in here all the casualties. What's the name of the guy that
02:46:01.08 --> 02:46:06.36 uh... Yeah, they're not fully listed in here. What's his name uh... wrote the book, the story of
02:46:06.36 --> 02:46:12.12 the story of the battle. What's it? What is it? Anyway, I've got that whole thing.
02:46:12.12 --> 02:46:22.84 They're all listed in here. One's wounded. One's it killed out right. Now this is his book by the
02:46:22.84 --> 02:46:28.92 way right here. See? That's the right here. Here, that book. Sure, what? Okay. Sure,
02:46:28.92 --> 02:46:33.32 right. Okay. No, you know, all of the names are all back here. So here they are. If you
02:46:33.32 --> 02:46:39.16 know, they're all back in here. See this? Got it. See that? So that's where they all are.
02:46:39.16 --> 02:46:46.44 And I talked to him in person and uh... it's getting okay, you know, to quote him.
02:46:47.16 --> 02:46:52.68 And I said, well, I have a little difficulty with uh... with the uh... publisher.
02:46:52.68 --> 02:46:57.64 Mm-hmm. Just don't pay any attention to them. So I'm giving you the okay. All right.
02:47:01.80 --> 02:47:08.84 Now you guys sail to Hawaii. So you go from you go from this hell. How
02:47:08.84 --> 02:47:12.76 longs take you to Hawaii? Like 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks?
02:47:13.80 --> 02:47:18.28 So then you guys get to Hawaii. You guys are pure side. You're all sitting up there looking
02:47:18.28 --> 02:47:25.000 pure side and a car pulls up and here we go back to the book. Outstept Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,
02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:31.08 Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Air. He's getting to ascend the gangway
02:47:31.08 --> 02:47:36.76 a company by an aide. His friends called him Chet. So did the Marines. The nuclear
02:47:36.76 --> 02:47:42.44 experiences had given them the right. He chet, they shouted. When we go back to the states,
02:47:42.44 --> 02:47:46.20 Chet, we can't wait for the Golden Gate. Does our skipper know the way to day go?
02:47:47.96 --> 02:47:51.72 How about some liberty, Chet? We got to get off this tub and do some Christmas shopping.
02:47:51.72 --> 02:47:58.04 And perhaps most tellingly, hey Admiral, get us someone who knows the reefs for our next landing.
02:47:59.24 --> 02:48:03.72 So that's that's why. And then his driver, then the same...
02:48:03.72 --> 02:48:11.000 Mark said his driver's seat. Oh yeah, you see, you guys you look like some
02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.36 Hollywood guy. Yeah, you look like Hollywood guy. So that's Chet's remarks,
02:48:14.36 --> 02:48:18.12 Marty. Yeah, you guys must have been pretty away. But anyway, for sure.
02:48:18.12 --> 02:48:23.000 Hard to control a couple off of taro. So anyway, he was, he was so glad to say these guys here.
02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000 So they're just full of it. Great. That's good. Yeah. And so here we go. Shortly after Nimitz
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:37.000 departs. The PA announced that the shared would be proceeding directly to the big island.
02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.64 In other words, no liberty on a wahoo. This didn't set well with the Marines.
02:48:41.64 --> 02:48:46.36 And they went wild hooting and yelling and whistling, throwing all matter of junk down on the
02:48:46.36 --> 02:48:51.000 dock, pelting the band and the short patrol. The band's been lowered. Their instruments
02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.20 and accompanied by the short patrols fled to a nearby shed. The eighth Marines achieve nothing
02:48:56.20 --> 02:49:00.52 with their show of angry emotions, except perhaps to blow off a lot of steam and confirm to all
02:49:00.52 --> 02:49:05.32 concern parties that they should not have been given liberty. The rest was not about the turn.
02:49:05.32 --> 02:49:10.52 These barbarians loose on the civilian populace of a wahoo. The civilized world wasn't ready
02:49:10.52 --> 02:49:13.96 for us. And to be honest, we weren't ready for this. And like, whole life is concerned.
02:49:13.96 --> 02:49:17.40 What, all I've got to do is Japanese. What are you going to do? And there's a lot of Japanese.
02:49:18.44 --> 02:49:21.88 It was just as well. The brass had plans for us. The second division as a whole.
02:49:21.88 --> 02:49:27.48 And these did not involve a return to the United States. First, we would go to the big island
02:49:27.48 --> 02:49:32.44 to rest rebuild and then train for them. And we had to put up the tents.
02:49:33.32 --> 02:49:39.000 There was no face to sleep. So they sent you guys out at the middle of a wahoo.
02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:45.88 No, no, no. This is this is a big island. They sent you out at the middle of it where you
02:49:45.88 --> 02:49:50.68 guys had to establish your own base camp. Oh yeah, yeah. We had to set up the tents and start training.
02:49:50.68 --> 02:50:01.56 Oh, yeah. You get here. You get the stuff out. And then after that, the camp was used by the
02:50:01.56 --> 02:50:09.32 others that eventually took Ewasima. Okay. You say here, you get the camps set up. You get a little
02:50:09.32 --> 02:50:12.76 bit of downtime. And then they get you guys right into training. Our training stress to combine
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:18.84 norms approach to warfare for veterans of Bayesian and Guadalcanal many aspects of this training
02:50:18.84 --> 02:50:23.32 world. But the replacements in the division we were receiving was receiving almost daily.
02:50:23.32 --> 02:50:29.32 They needed all of it. Replacements are going to be in the Guadalcanalcino area. And we knew
02:50:29.32 --> 02:50:33.48 we were going to use the tanks. And we knew that we were going to have to have communication
02:50:33.48 --> 02:50:38.44 by a phone and the back of the tank. Okay. Yeah, this was a new modification. It was a new
02:50:38.44 --> 02:50:45.24 new home. Yeah, home to the Hadoan maneuver around the strong points at all. You say that most
02:50:45.24 --> 02:50:50.28 of the replacements, most were fresh, fresh teenage, fresh, and so on. Now we're starting to get
02:50:50.28 --> 02:50:59.32 trapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you say here. Yeah. Eager kids with no combat experience and no
02:50:59.32 --> 02:51:03.56 idea what they got themselves into. The rest of us just looked at them and shook our heads. We
02:51:03.56 --> 02:51:07.72 did know what they had gotten themselves into. And we wondered how they would survive in the battles
02:51:07.72 --> 02:51:12.52 to come. Never forgetting that our own survival thus far was due in large measure to the vagaries
02:51:12.52 --> 02:51:17.32 of chance and circumstance and maybe just a little bit to the grace of God as well.
02:51:17.32 --> 02:51:21.88 Luck in God's grace, we're desperately slim reads on which to hang our hopes,
02:51:21.88 --> 02:51:26.52 slimmer still for the replacements because they're in experience. We expected that many would die.
02:51:26.52 --> 02:51:31.16 The odds were against them because they had seen no action. But we also expected to die.
02:51:31.16 --> 02:51:36.36 The odds were against us because we had seen too much action. Either way, you did the math.
02:51:36.36 --> 02:51:40.36 It came out bad. Yeah. And it's the war went on for another two years. Yeah, you're a
02:51:40.36 --> 02:51:46.68 hundred percent figure, you know. Yeah. Your chance of security. Yeah. Your percent. Yeah.
02:51:48.36 --> 02:51:51.40 We were, oh, here you talk about the drafties. We were especially skeptical about the
02:51:52.60 --> 02:51:58.28 skeptical about the drafties of which there were significant number. These were selective
02:51:58.28 --> 02:52:06.44 service Marines were something new to which was previously an all-volunteer force, new and unwanted
02:52:06.44 --> 02:52:10.44 and a matter of grave concern for the rest of us. Would the drafties measure up to Marine Corps
02:52:10.44 --> 02:52:15.64 standards? Would we be able to depend on them in battle? We had our doubts. We were wrong to doubt
02:52:15.64 --> 02:52:20.52 them in battle when the chips were down. They proved that like volunteers, they were worthy
02:52:20.52 --> 02:52:29.08 be called Marines. So you eventually take over a as a 60 millimeter mortar section. Yeah, because
02:52:29.08 --> 02:52:33.64 I'm still weak because you're still hurt. Yeah. And so I didn't have to get out and do a lot of
02:52:33.64 --> 02:52:41.000 moving around, you see. And then, again, you cover some of this stuff in good detail on the book,
02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.92 but then soon enough, it's your hit and cyber. I learned how to load this ship and
02:52:47.88 --> 02:52:54.20 be a court recorder and all that kind of stuff. Like do these stuff? How long were you guys in Hawaii
02:52:54.20 --> 02:53:01.32 for? Let me think about about six months, five months. Yeah. So you get five, did you get any
02:53:01.32 --> 02:53:05.80 liberty at that time? Oh yeah. Okay, so they let's go. Yeah, we were down a heel a lot. Okay. Yeah.
02:53:06.52 --> 02:53:13.72 Nice. Yeah. All right. So now you get done with that and then boom, morning, 15 June,
02:53:13.72 --> 02:53:19.40 1944. Shells rained down on our salt waves. This is Sipan. Yeah, but not before we left Hawaii.
02:53:20.76 --> 02:53:28.04 We had our LSTs all lined up, Sipaside. And one of them blew up a mortar shell or something
02:53:28.04 --> 02:53:33.64 that we were doing some welding or something. Anyway, I'm Mercy, I'll blew up. And then
02:53:33.64 --> 02:53:41.40 fires have spread from ship to ship. And we lost, I don't know, maybe could four or four hundred
02:53:41.40 --> 02:53:47.40 men would lost their lives. Yeah. And that whole lineup there. That's it. And then we lost a lot of
02:53:47.40 --> 02:53:52.20 equipment because of that. Did that set back the operation? Yeah, it did. It did put us, yeah.
02:53:52.20 --> 02:53:57.16 Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now that was in a place called Westlock. Yeah. You probably heard about that
02:53:57.16 --> 02:54:00.60 when Hampshire. Yeah, no, and you've got a written, I did. I heard for it about because they
02:54:00.60 --> 02:54:07.80 made changes to the way that they did business with regards to handling. Now this happened,
02:54:07.80 --> 02:54:15.08 this happened when we were at Lenny exercises on Maui. And I think we had some, we had some
02:54:15.08 --> 02:54:24.36 complications at Lenny do that whether something was. And so that was part of it. I, that was part
02:54:24.36 --> 02:54:28.60 of it. But the main thing, they don't know exactly what caused the explosion, but they think
02:54:28.60 --> 02:54:35.88 it probably was. What's what I just mentioned. Yeah. But guys got blew up and just got flying out.
02:54:36.84 --> 02:54:42.44 And one of my friends seems he had happened to him and he was swim, swim, no, he was picked
02:54:42.44 --> 02:54:50.12 up by bolt came by and had it pulled a line. So grab on. And then just drag them over to the beach,
02:54:50.12 --> 02:54:56.12 you know. It's incredible. It's crazy. These vets from Gualdo Canal and Tarowen and then
02:54:56.12 --> 02:55:04.76 de Paris and that was unbelievable. Yeah. But you push it back, I guess. And then you guys had
02:55:04.76 --> 02:55:10.52 this iPad. And here we go, June 15, 1944. Sheels rained down on our sole waves kicking up tall
02:55:10.52 --> 02:55:16.28 columns of water. Now can you imagine landing on side pan? They had all of our cheerrails set
02:55:16.28 --> 02:55:25.40 on the west side of the mountain. Fire over at us. All zeroed in on the reef and along the beach.
02:55:26.52 --> 02:55:32.76 All they had to do was just break back and forth. And we could even show you. And we lost so many
02:55:33.40 --> 02:55:37.40 all of wounded. Our wounded were all going back and then here they got hit by all this archery
02:55:37.40 --> 02:55:42.36 fire. And our pertain, a lot of what pertain commanders were wounded and killed. Because
02:55:42.36 --> 02:55:51.24 there were our main our CPs were wrecked along the beach. And then our ships couldn't fire back
02:55:51.24 --> 02:55:55.40 at them from that angle. They had to go clear around the outside of the island and hit them from
02:55:55.40 --> 02:56:02.68 the river. That's what happened. Yeah. You say here are not only that. They had to spot her
02:56:02.68 --> 02:56:10.60 on a smoke stack and it's sugar refinery. And all that was called in. Just perfect. Perfect. Yeah.
02:56:12.28 --> 02:56:17.96 To my friends were killed right there in the beach. One led to death. Yeah, they're a lot
02:56:17.96 --> 02:56:27.08 other. The same way. Basically it. Yeah. Yeah. This is what Murdoch said about it. Our amtrax
02:56:27.08 --> 02:56:31.48 were in line to breast and we were taking our telefired. The heaviest we ever encountered.
02:56:31.48 --> 02:56:36.04 Yeah. You could see the shells hitting the water exploded. Yeah. Making the water splash way up.
02:56:36.04 --> 02:56:41.56 Just off to my right shell, scored a direct hit on one of my boats and pow, it just went to pieces.
02:56:41.56 --> 02:56:46.60 There was a flash and a big explosion. I could see pieces of men flying out of it. I thought, oh shit.
02:56:46.60 --> 02:56:52.12 But I also thought thank God it wasn't my boat. But I was mostly thinking who was it that got hit
02:56:52.12 --> 02:57:01.56 and how many guys am I going to be without? Man Murdoch was a serious like marine combat leader.
02:57:01.56 --> 02:57:10.28 Yeah. He got there too. Hit there too. And this is this is your this is you say this is your
02:57:10.28 --> 02:57:14.44 experience. When my amtrax reached the reef we were all crouched low below the sides. There was
02:57:14.44 --> 02:57:19.32 too much metal flying around the air to risk popping up for a look around. The guys had their heads
02:57:19.32 --> 02:57:24.52 pulled down between their shoulders and they stared at each other with eyes. We big eyes and said nothing.
02:57:24.52 --> 02:57:28.20 The veterans of Taro had been through this before and were probably having a harder time of it,
02:57:28.20 --> 02:57:32.52 precisely because of their prior experience because they knew how bad things could get.
02:57:32.52 --> 02:57:35.64 The new kids were mostly better off because they didn't have a clue.
02:57:36.36 --> 02:57:39.96 Certainly they were scared but they were also fascinated and awestruck by all the noise and
02:57:39.96 --> 02:57:44.68 commotion and these emotions blunted their fear. Nothing in their experience had prepared for them
02:57:44.68 --> 02:57:50.20 for this. The live fire exercise in Hawaii were puny by comparison and so they did not realize
02:57:50.20 --> 02:57:55.32 that our situation was terrible and likely to get worse. You can be sure that I was scared but
02:57:55.32 --> 02:58:03.08 fortunately I had the concerns of an officer to distract me. What wave were you and what group were
02:58:03.08 --> 02:58:11.24 you in? There was so many with ahead of us on the beach I landed on. We were way on the northern
02:58:11.24 --> 02:58:19.48 end of the landing beach and what happened is the tide of her was forces further way to the left
02:58:19.48 --> 02:58:27.000 and we had to realign a couple hundred yards further back to right again. Now thing is there's
02:58:28.36 --> 02:58:34.20 we didn't have a lot of problem getting into the beach but once we got to the beach there
02:58:34.20 --> 02:58:42.92 was nobody on the beach so they didn't defend themselves at the beach instead it was a heavier
02:58:42.92 --> 02:58:49.64 artillery fire so they landed basically you landed through but where I was we had to cross a
02:58:49.64 --> 02:58:54.44 fighter strip that they had so we had to cross and that was kind of scary going across that
02:58:54.44 --> 02:59:02.84 exposed from people shooting out of the side but then as we maneuvered kept moving to the right
02:59:02.84 --> 02:59:08.12 further to get back where we were supposed to be then the heavy artillery fired just all over
02:59:08.12 --> 02:59:15.16 the place it was just cannon wound him or um yeah you said so many good men were killed that day
02:59:15.16 --> 02:59:21.16 one of them was first lieutenant new old teacher yeah he was a four-year school teacher
02:59:21.16 --> 02:59:26.68 former school teacher you know when I went on one on the I'm never did together a lot in
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:32.60 New Zealand yeah shell fragment sliced off one of his legs no country be found to help him yeah he
02:59:32.60 --> 02:59:43.16 did it died no other than the same time oh yeah that's his from moral artery pumped the last of his
02:59:43.16 --> 02:59:47.16 blood on to the sand he looked up at those gout around him and whispered get them in off the beach
02:59:47.16 --> 02:59:54.68 yeah yeah yeah because more the fire was coming in we're on the same time John we saw these guns
02:59:54.68 --> 03:00:00.60 by the way when we return up there those guns are still up there two of them are and now it's
03:00:00.60 --> 03:00:06.36 it's a Japanese memorial and that these are part of the memorial up there yeah I I mentioned to you
03:00:06.36 --> 03:00:11.32 that I was just saying I'm too this is right above a physical sandbass city in the city yeah
03:00:11.32 --> 03:00:16.36 right up there I don't know if we I don't know specifically because no I don't know I don't know
03:00:16.36 --> 03:00:21.24 talk of that hill as you get it was a big night above on the top now it'd be just in the
03:00:21.24 --> 03:00:26.92 North towards Shepard shell yeah it's just that that's where the that's where these these are
03:00:26.92 --> 03:00:34.36 this artillery is however and then then down to the left there's the monsters monsters that
03:00:35.96 --> 03:00:43.08 dig out of where they they got the coral the coral gravel or sand to make the airport with
03:00:43.08 --> 03:00:49.72 now that all got filled in with Japanese tanks and and and the amphibian tractors they're all buried
03:00:49.72 --> 03:00:54.84 right in there you probably didn't see it because it's all been buried but I got a picture picture
03:00:54.84 --> 03:01:05.88 I mean one book here I want to look like before they recovered up so I was here when when
03:01:05.88 --> 03:01:12.84 your friend knew was it new no no you said around the same time John Murdach John Murdach was
03:01:12.84 --> 03:01:19.56 running up the beach after disembarking from his amtrak came across Gus Kriger Kriger
03:01:19.56 --> 03:01:24.28 of one of B company's veteran first we tendons in a close friend he's who was lying on the ground
03:01:24.28 --> 03:01:29.80 I've got his picture here yeah his body perforated by shrapnel he was alive but just barely
03:01:29.80 --> 03:01:35.08 John now beside his friend I looked at him to see what I could do for him John recall but he was
03:01:35.08 --> 03:01:39.96 bleeding and so many places I knew I couldn't do anything he wanted to cigarette so I gave him one
03:01:39.96 --> 03:01:46.28 I let that form and I said Gus you'll be okay I got to go I had to go there was too much to
03:01:46.28 --> 03:01:52.68 do I had to get the company organized and I left him there so he died there I've visited his wife
03:01:52.68 --> 03:02:00.76 back afterwards he was later lost within the span of a few minutes John had lost two of his
03:02:00.76 --> 03:02:04.76 season to put two leaders also wounded and put out of action were the second and third battalion
03:02:04.76 --> 03:02:11.88 commanders we tend to crumble Henry P. Jim Crow you heard him and Jim Crow yeah legendary
03:02:11.88 --> 03:02:16.84 he was the former commander of the scout sniper school that you did and also we
03:02:16.84 --> 03:02:22.12 tended John Miller, Lieutenant Colonel John Miller so both the battalion commanders out of
03:02:22.12 --> 03:02:32.44 action yeah from that artillery yeah man yeah you're again you know it looks
03:02:32.44 --> 03:02:37.24 sort of hopeless so that's stage just seeming hopeless here we're catching heavy artillery fire
03:02:37.24 --> 03:02:41.56 and we couldn't do anything about it you know it's it's I like I like bringing up these points in the
03:02:41.56 --> 03:02:45.16 book where you talk about things like this while that's all that's happening you say meanwhile
03:02:45.16 --> 03:02:49.64 I lay in the brush with my man and try to free myself from the despair that suddenly gripped
03:02:49.64 --> 03:02:55.16 me the situation seemed hopeless it was Tarua all over again how I wonder do we gonna get out of
03:02:55.16 --> 03:03:00.76 this mess exactly my feelings at that time and then you say the feelings soon passed I just didn't
03:03:00.76 --> 03:03:06.52 have time for it at my command we moved out everyone rose from their shell holes and craters
03:03:06.52 --> 03:03:11.88 and went forward no hesitation imagine from the bushy strip we lumbered about 10 feet to the
03:03:11.88 --> 03:03:16.36 air strip keep going keep going ahead myself shouting don't stop it's good I like to bring
03:03:16.36 --> 03:03:22.84 those points up because there's several times where you talk about you as a leader have to kind of
03:03:22.84 --> 03:03:28.52 get yourself together and and I think what that's helpful for for is young leaders in the military
03:03:28.52 --> 03:03:33.000 that are gonna feel that same thing if they get into tough situation okay you got to recognize it
03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:42.12 and then you got to take action young 23 year old with all that responsibility I got so then
03:03:42.84 --> 03:03:51.08 next day I got got strapped off my own motors hit hit the leaves up above us and went off
03:03:55.08 --> 03:04:00.60 I didn't report it it just I got entered entered up and there's still air or there goes still there
03:04:00.60 --> 03:04:08.84 I didn't report it yeah you guys are pushing forward and then you guys get kind of a
03:04:10.12 --> 03:04:15.48 a skirmish line and then the Japanese counterattack several points along our line
03:04:16.04 --> 03:04:21.56 Don mains he recalled this they bonds out across the gas dang swamp and we just shot him up
03:04:21.56 --> 03:04:25.80 the swamp was marshy water and you remember it's a physical suicide he likes a
03:04:25.80 --> 03:04:30.92 super I don't remember it's a swampy area and what happened is one of the other officers
03:04:30.92 --> 03:04:36.44 in our battalion he was like a soldier for a type of a guy and he'd been with a pretty
03:04:36.44 --> 03:04:42.52 state army as an ambulance driver and north Africa and we just figured well he's either going to be
03:04:42.52 --> 03:04:47.40 a hero or he's gonna get killed one the other and he got killed what happened was that that
03:04:47.40 --> 03:04:53.96 we were we're at this spot and there are a lot of Japanese on the other side not exposing himself yet
03:04:53.96 --> 03:04:58.36 but he's trying to get it he walked out of head trying to get him and exposing himself he thought
03:04:58.36 --> 03:05:04.92 they were he getting him a surrender and instead this one guy being over had received him
03:05:04.92 --> 03:05:17.72 and strapped his back killed him yeah a lot of guys a lot of casualties and and actually
03:05:17.72 --> 03:05:26.20 at this point there's another casualty and it's a guy by the name of John Murdoch and this story
03:05:26.20 --> 03:05:34.76 is about as good of a story as I've ever heard about the military as a whole so here we go this is
03:05:34.76 --> 03:05:40.84 around this time John Murdoch also became a casualty hit while landing B company hit while
03:05:40.84 --> 03:05:47.40 leading B company on a sweep west of the landing strip down toward Sharan Konoa yeah
03:05:47.40 --> 03:05:54.36 Sharan Konoa and this is so this is John Murdoch now it's called it's really is a
03:05:54.36 --> 03:06:03.08 shalin shalin Konoa they couldn't they couldn't pronounce they couldn't fence their
03:06:03.08 --> 03:06:12.68 are so we call Sharon Konoa so here's John Murdoch talk in fact all of our past signs
03:06:12.68 --> 03:06:18.44 had a lot of wires in her teeth and that's where Roger comes from right yeah like when we say Roger could
03:06:18.44 --> 03:06:24.04 be I was told that that's possible I had thought that it's possible yeah that's the original
03:06:24.04 --> 03:06:29.24 usage was that we knew if someone says Roger you know it was on quite on Guadalcanale Murdoch
03:06:29.24 --> 03:06:36.28 was in there was was taking a piss and here Japanese come come in they don't know if I
03:06:36.28 --> 03:06:44.12 caught sure not is an engineer in one of our interpreters oh you read out a second take I don't
03:06:44.12 --> 03:06:50.92 know how you mentioned that yeah you're about it and here oh yeah oh gosh so here's Murdoch
03:06:50.92 --> 03:06:56.52 talking about him he gets wounded yeah opposition was very light on the other side of the strip
03:06:56.52 --> 03:07:00.52 and when we got down to the end of it we stopped and a Sherman tank came up to help us the tank
03:07:00.52 --> 03:07:03.64 had a phone in the back and I was on the phone and I'm trying to tell the guy inside what
03:07:03.64 --> 03:07:08.68 what I wanted him to shoot at the big smoke stack in the sugar cane factory I figured a
03:07:08.68 --> 03:07:13.48 jab was up there spotting for artillery which was very accurate then all of a sudden boom
03:07:13.48 --> 03:07:18.28 shell started falling all around the tank and I knew the spotter in the smoke stop was telling
03:07:18.28 --> 03:07:23.72 his guns to fire at us so I ordered the tank commander get that smoke stack then I put the phone
03:07:23.72 --> 03:07:27.96 back on and I'm running back to the safety in a hole and that's when I got hit by shrapnel in the
03:07:27.96 --> 03:07:34.44 left leg in the right elbow so I'm sitting there and the corpsman comes over and starts bandaging
03:07:34.44 --> 03:07:39.48 my arm and I look down and I'm down and my pants are all wet and I said holy shit I piss my
03:07:39.48 --> 03:07:43.72 pants and the corpsman said that's not pissed that's blood that's my found out I'd been hitting
03:07:43.72 --> 03:07:48.20 the leg so I dropped my pants and my drawers and now the corpsman's bandaging up my lead
03:07:48.20 --> 03:07:52.92 leg and the jab start to shell us again so I jumped and ran to a nearby hole which wasn't
03:07:52.92 --> 03:07:58.92 easy you know because my pants and my drawers were down around my ankles and so because I haven't
03:07:58.92 --> 03:08:03.16 read the entire book you know you talk about Murdoch and I've mentioned that he was a character
03:08:03.16 --> 03:08:07.64 and you know obviously you mentioned that he liked drink and one of the people he was in
03:08:07.64 --> 03:08:12.60 alcoholic a lot of time he finally got over yeah well one of the people that I would say what's
03:08:12.60 --> 03:08:17.24 that word aided him in being an alcoholic and somebody he apparently become a good friends with
03:08:17.24 --> 03:08:23.16 because it was a Catholic was the Catholic priest father Jo Keehan so they were really good friends
03:08:23.16 --> 03:08:32.12 and they spent a lot of time together and so as as he's starting to move towards being leaving the
03:08:32.12 --> 03:08:38.92 area there's a guy John's executive John's exo Jim Westman appeared on the scene and told and
03:08:38.92 --> 03:08:44.44 John told Westman to take over. He's a Westy congratulations you just made company commander I'm getting
03:08:44.44 --> 03:08:50.44 out of here now Westman got hit by the same arterial that I almost got hit almost got
03:08:50.44 --> 03:08:56.92 covered with and he he was out of the service after that he got badly wounded. Wow and we
03:08:56.92 --> 03:09:07.56 got 50 casualties in Westman was one of I was so so this is Murdoch continuing how it goes from him
03:09:07.56 --> 03:09:12.92 so I head down for the beach looking for the evacuation team I wasn't bleeding all that badly
03:09:12.92 --> 03:09:17.96 but I was a mess I could walk sure and I walked I was looking for one particular doctor
03:09:17.96 --> 03:09:23.16 soul cassal a dentist early your I had seen him on the beach there now I found him and I said
03:09:23.16 --> 03:09:28.36 solos this is fun he's a sound and my friend a ticket please because you couldn't get evacuated
03:09:28.36 --> 03:09:33.16 without a ticket they had to put a ticket on you he looked me over my right hand wasn't any good I
03:09:33.16 --> 03:09:38.68 couldn't use it so solomon ticketed me a little while later I was evacuated in a small boat
03:09:38.68 --> 03:09:44.68 and I said to the navy kid who is driving get hey find me a p.a. 51 will you and he said sure
03:09:44.68 --> 03:09:49.96 we found the ship and by then I was lying down and the guys on the deck called down to me
03:09:49.96 --> 03:09:55.96 will pick you up in a boom on a stretcher and I came up in the basket and I'm all dirty and
03:09:55.96 --> 03:10:02.12 bloody and I see our chaplain father Jo Keehan who I'd become very friendly with so when they took
03:10:02.12 --> 03:10:07.40 me out of the basket and put me on the stretcher on the deck I closed my eyes and attended I was dead
03:10:08.60 --> 03:10:13.72 father Jo Keehan over and started giving me my last bite in the church last right of the church in
03:10:13.72 --> 03:10:19.40 Latin but I can't keep a straight face so I opened my eyes and smiled at him and he goes you son of a
03:10:19.40 --> 03:10:24.60 bitch he goes right from speaking lap Latin to calling me a son of a bitch then he took me down to the
03:10:24.60 --> 03:10:28.68 infirmary and they patched me up a bit then he took me to his state room and put me in his bed I
03:10:28.68 --> 03:10:33.72 must have slept all day and all night I didn't hear a thing I wasn't feeling any pain my night my
03:10:33.72 --> 03:10:38.76 right hand and arm will numb when I came to I didn't know where I was at first then I took a shower
03:10:38.76 --> 03:10:43.72 changed the bandages and got cleaned up that was the end of my war there my second day on side
03:10:43.72 --> 03:10:49.08 pan my right arm was no good really my hand even today is no good yeah here's the thing even
03:10:49.08 --> 03:10:53.08 after it's many quite a snoop there's this summer be done
03:10:53.08 --> 03:10:59.40 it was a million dollar room I don't have any feeling the right side of my hand the nervous
03:10:59.40 --> 03:11:03.32 cutters are million dollar room really because my thumb and two fingers are good still good
03:11:03.32 --> 03:11:11.000 and the next the last finger the little finger we're dead so I thought that was about as good
03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:21.88 of a story as I've ever heard oh character you know you know when he what happened to him there
03:11:21.88 --> 03:11:29.64 when he walked barred into this hotel window and he was drunk as drunk as I'll get out of
03:11:29.64 --> 03:11:35.08 course well anyway the retain commander talked to him then next day about it and he says you know
03:11:35.08 --> 03:11:40.20 you should be more like an officer you shouldn't be doing that then he went on to say then
03:11:40.20 --> 03:11:45.08 the retain commander says well why don't we'll mind and say so I'm kind of like that myself
03:11:47.08 --> 03:11:51.24 you got a whole story about him in the whole one this same retain commander he was killed on
03:11:51.24 --> 03:11:59.08 Bogumville as he landed they call them they called him well he he took over the one of the
03:12:02.04 --> 03:12:07.96 what he called it one of the the Chinese way column yeah name right there in name form like the
03:12:07.96 --> 03:12:17.24 equivalent of the of the in in England the equivalent of it and what I don't know I don't know
03:12:17.24 --> 03:12:23.72 was an important you know that kind of like the like the uh recoluses but no no no no no no no no no no
03:12:23.72 --> 03:12:30.36 there be unit that would be the ones that just like you a seal say a raider a raider he took over the
03:12:30.36 --> 03:12:36.52 raider battalion that landed on Bogumville okay and he was killed there and then his his comments
03:12:36.52 --> 03:12:49.96 were as he died so well it's been a short war for me well well you there's actually another another one
03:12:49.96 --> 03:12:56.36 of these big situations that happens where there's a battle at sea oh yeah Philpincy yeah
03:12:57.40 --> 03:13:03.40 and Maryana's turkey shoot yeah you know that it's coming you'd see this before and he said
03:13:03.40 --> 03:13:07.24 we were right a few days later we learned that a great battle had indeed been fought in the waters off
03:13:07.24 --> 03:13:12.12 west of siphon something in the decisive victory for the US yeah well yeah with their defeat in the
03:13:12.12 --> 03:13:19.24 battle of the Philpincy the Japanese lost all hope of re-releaving their forces on siphon now was up to
03:13:19.24 --> 03:13:25.08 us the marines knee army to win the land battle do we call do I call it the mariana's turkey shoot
03:13:25.08 --> 03:13:29.88 yeah I did right there okay I don't think you've used those words well okay that's that's
03:13:29.88 --> 03:13:35.96 traditionally what it's called yeah that is that's the same one now that's the reason that this guy
03:13:37.88 --> 03:13:44.60 he held on because he thought the navy could come back and take it back now because he surrendered
03:13:44.60 --> 03:13:53.24 even after the war he was not promoted to major in a terrible and and the other thing was even
03:13:53.24 --> 03:14:00.60 the other other officer that I visited the same time that had fired at us from business artillery
03:14:00.60 --> 03:14:07.96 in Guadalcanel named by name a tannihaki otannih he bad mouth is this guy says well he should have
03:14:07.96 --> 03:14:16.52 even committed here he's even now he's a third side he's gonna be even he's still yeah oh yeah
03:14:16.52 --> 03:14:26.84 now you guys are kind of pressing through the rest of the island you say here my mortar
03:14:26.84 --> 03:14:30.68 section was always about 200 yards behind our lead elements and outbreak of small arms
03:14:30.68 --> 03:14:36.44 firing front of us was a single stop and set up our weapons you see now in the in that
03:14:37.32 --> 03:14:45.32 that movie about Pacific now you mean the the series the Pacific series yeah here here they had a
03:14:45.32 --> 03:14:49.64 six-million meter per his right up in the front and I don't know why the advisor does hey you don't do
03:14:49.64 --> 03:14:57.40 that yeah it doesn't make any sense and also all script is all screwed up it was all about a guy
03:14:57.40 --> 03:15:03.72 that was going through a going through some kind of a psychological thing and hurry's talking he's talking
03:15:03.72 --> 03:15:11.72 to the the kernel in charge of the of the of the of the hospital that he's at you know that
03:15:11.72 --> 03:15:17.88 you're talking to the carman you know stuff like that yeah well Hollywood they don't always
03:15:17.88 --> 03:15:23.40 terrible because you know they have to in the real world everything goes spread out so you
03:15:23.40 --> 03:15:29.16 know that they take a picture so they they they take a picture some real concentrating you see
03:15:29.16 --> 03:15:36.12 it's not like that at all yeah still one of my favorite uh war movies the Pacific yeah
03:15:36.12 --> 03:15:43.08 what did you think of it well this this sets for incredible they were incredible I
03:15:43.08 --> 03:15:50.52 I like friends this I I've been to Palo and good wonderful wonderful wonderful set yeah the
03:15:52.04 --> 03:16:00.60 and let's see what was it there what was the other place they were they did Guadalcanale
03:16:00.60 --> 03:16:06.28 so one Guadalcanale yeah well all the landings were they were great yeah they were great
03:16:07.72 --> 03:16:12.28 was that one I was you know yeah that what I thought I did it cover each size those two
03:16:14.52 --> 03:16:21.24 okay I'm thinking primarily I wanted Palo to like yes yeah yeah yeah I just the first time I ever
03:16:21.24 --> 03:16:27.64 watched it I was riding on a airplane I had it on my computer I had a headphone's in I was watching
03:16:27.64 --> 03:16:33.000 it really close and I I thought that the tone of the script is horrible oh the script might be
03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:38.76 horrible out the combat scenes for me they were unbelievable unbelievable the any actually
03:16:38.76 --> 03:16:42.76 we have your book I was I was saying while they did a great job because one thing that I
03:16:42.76 --> 03:16:48.92 was said to myself you know it's you know when some of the fire fights the night fire fights
03:16:48.92 --> 03:16:52.52 it's just flashes and they're like oh yeah that's what it's like there you go and you capture
03:16:52.52 --> 03:16:57.64 it in your book you can't really tell what's going on but it's bad yeah and they did a great job
03:16:57.64 --> 03:17:03.80 of capturing that hopefully this nail die who we'll pick up on this yeah you'll see the potential there
03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000 hopefully you will see
03:17:13.48 --> 03:17:18.44 so now you guys are as you guys are pushing through you say casualties overall were relatively light
03:17:18.44 --> 03:17:25.000 yes they were at that time well thing is you know this ran for almost a month so yeah I
03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:31.48 just dragged out but the casualties were kept coming in of course yeah and then you say meanwhile
03:17:31.48 --> 03:17:34.76 off to a right in the other side of the mountain the 27th Division had run into a meet grind
03:17:34.76 --> 03:17:39.48 of these areas attacking on a plateau a plateau border on its left by a sheer cliff that formed
03:17:39.48 --> 03:17:47.48 the east face of the mountain called purple herds yeah and they were held up and so
03:17:48.76 --> 03:17:56.92 Alameda Smith he just he got rid of their their general and the army and National Guard troops
03:17:56.92 --> 03:18:01.08 they they they they never really got over it that was unfair they shouldn't have done that
03:18:01.08 --> 03:18:05.48 well I they did run if some terrible things down there were catching from the flank you know
03:18:05.48 --> 03:18:11.64 true bad yeah and here I was up I was up way in and further and I could look down I see what they're up against
03:18:14.12 --> 03:18:20.76 here speaking of friendly forces or friendly fire incidents here you were I was resting on one
03:18:20.76 --> 03:18:25.56 knee next to a tree holding my carbine upright where you go up plate to the ground when suddenly
03:18:25.56 --> 03:18:31.000 wham wham wham three big shells explode over a hundred to five millimeter long-term long-times
03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:38.36 long range the shells cannot from Japanese artillery but from a battery of armored tanks didn't
03:18:38.36 --> 03:18:44.28 believe that we were that far forward so he did it I found out like the western man told me about it
03:18:45.24 --> 03:18:52.92 he's the one that called it in short he and it was horrible oh it was devastating oh my
03:18:52.92 --> 03:18:56.92 guys so so many guys were just pulverized we didn't know what it hit us most of us did not hear the
03:18:56.92 --> 03:19:01.08 shells coming no one's out of nowhere no one ducked for cover no one of the shells burst in the
03:19:01.08 --> 03:19:05.72 tree above me deflecting the force of the blast and most of the strappin' outwards and set a
03:19:05.72 --> 03:19:10.84 straight down that's my life a single piece of metal pierced my elbow the wound whose larger than
03:19:10.84 --> 03:19:15.24 a bullet hole about an ancient dinammer at hurt like hell but it didn't look serious it hardly
03:19:15.24 --> 03:19:21.80 blood and the bone didn't seem damaged it's still the wound needed treatment a few minutes later
03:19:21.80 --> 03:19:26.76 several hospital jeeps converged on the scene and I talked over one of them on the way just 50 yards
03:19:26.76 --> 03:19:30.84 from me I passed a large creator containing the remains of several men from weapons platoon who
03:19:30.84 --> 03:19:35.16 been playing blackjack when the shell hit their position they'd little bit literally been blown
03:19:35.16 --> 03:19:41.32 to bits several of those men had been my friends in Samoa I'd served in their unit before
03:19:41.32 --> 03:19:47.08 being commissioned I could identify only one of them and because he was glasses yeah yeah
03:19:47.88 --> 03:19:54.04 a few of the name was costinson a fact I have a picture of him too somewhere here
03:19:54.04 --> 03:20:00.52 a few yards further on a dead marine lay in a hole beneath a coral outcropping where I had
03:20:00.52 --> 03:20:06.60 spent the previous night he'd been killed by the army's misdirected salvo the same shell
03:20:06.60 --> 03:20:11.88 the killer yeah you want yeah the same shell that killed the blackjack players wound a dick
03:20:11.88 --> 03:20:16.36 stine then a member of weapons platoon he doesn't remember the explosion or anything else about
03:20:16.36 --> 03:20:19.48 the day one moment I'm standing on the ground with the guys in the weapons platoon and the next
03:20:19.48 --> 03:20:23.40 thing and I know I'm waking up in a tent there in the fuel hospital and it's around midnight
03:20:23.40 --> 03:20:27.72 just a concussion in this case he just how long am I here so he just takes off
03:20:31.40 --> 03:20:34.76 he's could still be alive I think he's he's in a rest of now I think
03:20:36.36 --> 03:20:41.56 all in all the shells from the 150s fives killed or wounded more than 50 marines
03:20:42.60 --> 03:20:49.96 yeah yeah yeah now the fellow wrote the wrote a book we came to win or we are be killed or
03:20:49.96 --> 03:20:57.96 did die and he got hit he retired as a Colonel by the way and anyway he got hit by the same
03:20:57.96 --> 03:21:04.36 same rounds and then put him out he got he got medical medical discipline uh retirement
03:21:06.28 --> 03:21:12.20 devasting no no no no no that he had one of his pretty close to friends
03:21:12.20 --> 03:21:18.12 turns out he was my company commander at at this particular time and uh the cell server they
03:21:18.12 --> 03:21:25.16 was cell server he'd been a professional dancer and he got he got hit by by a large round
03:21:25.56 --> 03:21:32.84 on on on on uh tenion and then I then I took over took over I was at exact took over and
03:21:32.84 --> 03:21:39.24 he went he went to the hospital in Guadalcanal he killed himself because he did want to live
03:21:39.24 --> 03:21:47.16 without a one leg because he's professional dancer and I know I don't think that this fellow wrote
03:21:47.16 --> 03:21:52.12 the book realized he he he writes in the book he was the spun it he didn't rent he didn't never
03:21:52.12 --> 03:21:56.60 mention he killed himself I talked to the guy that wrote the book he didn't really know one
03:21:56.60 --> 03:22:03.48 yet others well he did I know what a coincidence I dated a gal one time she was a she was a
03:22:05.16 --> 03:22:11.000 receptionist for William Morris agency and they they represent a lot of the big people
03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:19.16 then it turned around all of those well anyway uh she uh I was invited to their Christmas party
03:22:20.36 --> 03:22:27.32 and this was in 44 William Morris agency and as they came in she told me who was so on
03:22:27.32 --> 03:22:34.44 money will be and so on is he all came in and then I ended up a day to do a couple of times and one time
03:22:34.44 --> 03:22:40.76 uh we were in this uh this big place well no place can't think of name now but anyway
03:22:41.48 --> 03:22:47.72 others had just returned it's about a month after I had from from Memorionis and I said how did
03:22:47.72 --> 03:22:54.92 he how did son son make out and they said oh you didn't know he killed himself my girlfriend
03:22:55.48 --> 03:23:00.52 says I knew that we were close fans of his family we used to play brist together
03:23:00.52 --> 03:23:12.92 and a small world that's crazy yeah that's crazy yeah so at this point you're wounded yeah yeah
03:23:12.92 --> 03:23:19.000 and you go back to the aid station yeah and then late on the 7th of July my 3rd day in the
03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:23.80 field hospital doctors and corpsman went through the words towards telling all the walking
03:23:23.80 --> 03:23:29.64 to remember to the units because we had to lock up and they were about to the Japanese
03:23:29.64 --> 03:23:36.60 and the guns I had to have a still thousands of their hiding ready ready to kill themselves
03:23:36.60 --> 03:23:45.72 or make one last bunch of charge and her I had walked right through her 40 were killed
03:23:45.72 --> 03:23:51.56 that that that the last night of the mop up can you imagine and then this guy
03:23:51.56 --> 03:24:01.32 he was in these were his men and when I I found out his track his track and my track
03:24:02.04 --> 03:24:07.88 crossed okay I found out on that and so when I once stood I wanted to talk to him sure enough
03:24:07.88 --> 03:24:12.76 she's yeah I was there some reason I wasn't saying bonds on all that no that was another guy
03:24:14.52 --> 03:24:19.24 so here and then then he and then then the guy wrote a book about him I have the copy of the book

03:24:42.12 --> 03:24:48.04 and when he came he and his wife came and some of our guys treated him materially they could not
03:24:48.04 --> 03:24:54.28 believe this guy could have done what he did as far as given him such a bad time being up there
03:24:54.28 --> 03:24:58.76 right up until after the war and I tried to I tried to call things down and I had to hit

03:25:28.52 --> 03:25:33.88 interviewing this is the other guy that fired his known as pistol peat he's one that did
03:25:33.88 --> 03:25:43.32 most of the shooting at us at 105 long range rifle yeah for him and two and one was on
03:25:43.32 --> 03:25:50.28 Guadalcanale we we went to it that's I have a picture in my book with him standing at it and
03:25:50.28 --> 03:26:01.08 he became a major his his father had been a general in at a kind of like our like west point
03:26:01.08 --> 03:26:08.68 but for senior officers to come to and one of these officers was the prince he was a
03:26:08.68 --> 03:26:14.84 tenant general became a lieutenant general and he was one of the one standing on a Missouri
03:26:14.84 --> 03:26:22.76 at this room that was the one of his students his father's students amazing huh yeah
03:26:23.40 --> 03:26:28.92 and by the way this is what the bonds are look like here you see that here we're we buried those bodies
03:26:28.92 --> 03:26:33.32 we dragged them into the ditch and we buried probably 4,000 bodies like that
03:26:34.92 --> 03:26:40.60 well and now they're homes all through here yeah for so they're still there they're still
03:26:40.60 --> 03:26:47.24 they're only about four feet down and then then there's then there's a beautiful new hotels right
03:26:47.24 --> 03:26:52.52 on the beach just across the road from that and you were probably told about that when you were
03:26:52.52 --> 03:26:58.12 there I don't know it's a place called place called tannipay I don't know tannipay and also
03:26:58.12 --> 03:27:05.40 place called sandrokey yeah so for people that are just listening these are just images of
03:27:05.40 --> 03:27:13.16 this this massive attack it happened was we we fired in our live in three is our tour
03:27:13.16 --> 03:27:21.08 we fired in at them as they were charging and so their bodies are all chuda all chuda
03:27:21.88 --> 03:27:26.52 you go into some pretty good detail about the about that bonds I had to talk about this
03:27:26.52 --> 03:27:32.12 about the age band and radio that is a best you'll find anywhere and in fact
03:27:33.24 --> 03:27:38.76 that's where you know I had to reveal it in detail because I had some doubt about it and I said
03:27:38.76 --> 03:27:43.80 well it looks like in general he's okay he's he's said it right there's nobody else can talk about
03:27:43.80 --> 03:27:49.08 it's in that detail don't but he can then oh it's a great idea oh first hand yeah
03:27:49.08 --> 03:27:57.40 now I did go to a reunion of those people in that battalion back in Iowa and so this guy was
03:27:57.40 --> 03:28:04.36 there and he was one of the ones that the interview of course for this yeah and then yeah so
03:28:04.36 --> 03:28:11.40 if you want to do some account of just incredible fortitude you got to read this book and
03:28:11.40 --> 03:28:18.84 then it picks up where you what you were just talking about this is when you go now to do sort of the
03:28:20.52 --> 03:28:26.52 sort of a cleanup and you see this many of the bodies were recognizable yeah and
03:28:29.24 --> 03:28:34.04 one of the guys Sandy and the others had to reach the bloody remains for dog tags that would
03:28:34.04 --> 03:28:39.32 identify their friends discovering which one of their friends they were charging and hunger
03:28:39.32 --> 03:28:45.48 if I own people were killed most of them soldiers they went right through them you say that this
03:28:45.48 --> 03:28:51.40 bonsai this bonsai resulted in as near as I can determine from what I saw and what I've read
03:28:51.40 --> 03:28:57.72 the Japanese lost upward of 4,000 men some 500 Americans were killed most of them from the army
03:28:57.72 --> 03:29:02.60 the two battalions that were overrun and nearly wiped out each battery suffered 150 two
03:29:02.60 --> 03:29:07.64 casualties in the attack 75 killed or 6 wounded they got completely your run
03:29:07.64 --> 03:29:12.28 it's estimated that some 600 Japanese were killed on the open ground directly in front of the
03:29:12.28 --> 03:29:23.80 batteries guns yeah yeah man you're you were pushing up again this is another another thing
03:29:23.80 --> 03:29:27.24 that you passed through we passed through their positions and deployed to skirmish lines
03:29:27.24 --> 03:29:31.32 extending the water's edge in the railroad tracks of 6 buildings advancing along the
03:29:32.52 --> 03:29:37.48 along the shore in the eighth of longer road yeah thus a raid we picked our way
03:29:37.48 --> 03:29:42.28 slowly through the battle zone our weapons at the ready all around the dead were thick on the
03:29:42.28 --> 03:29:47.48 ground in numbers that defied comprehension bodies and pieces of bodies everywhere artillery
03:29:47.48 --> 03:29:52.04 and pounded the area and chopped up the bodies turning the battlefield into an immense open air
03:29:52.04 --> 03:29:58.04 abitwar strewn with torsos and limbs and heads and chunks of unadunifiable flesh burned black
03:29:58.04 --> 03:30:03.64 by fire I could recreate the flow I could recreate the flow and ferocity the battle the
03:30:03.64 --> 03:30:08.20 patterns of the fight and flight by the numbers and positioning of the dead there would be places
03:30:08.20 --> 03:30:12.76 pockets of resistance where bodies were pile on top of bodies dead Japanese entangled with
03:30:12.76 --> 03:30:18.04 that americans frozen in attitudes of hand to hand combat clutching each other plunging
03:30:18.04 --> 03:30:22.76 bay nets into each other locked in their death struggles arm machine gun positions were
03:30:22.76 --> 03:30:27.32 tabloids of butchery with bodies of the Japanese heaped in front of positions and bodies of
03:30:27.32 --> 03:30:32.92 american soldiers slumped over their guns for men who didn't want to be there the US army soldiers
03:30:32.92 --> 03:30:38.04 they were a lot of drafts and all of a bunch of drafts here too yeah not all the Japanese were
03:30:38.04 --> 03:30:43.88 dead of course as usual some were shaming yeah we knew this would be the case and we very quickly
03:30:43.88 --> 03:30:47.48 and we're very quick on our triggers if we saw any movement if one of those bodies so much
03:30:47.48 --> 03:30:52.28 is twitch we poor fire we'd poor fire into it even if we didn't see movement if a body or group
03:30:52.28 --> 03:30:57.08 of bodies looks suspicious we shot it through and through bushes big enough to provide concealment
03:30:57.08 --> 03:31:03.48 were preemptively blasted into wood chips and leaf bits now and then as we advance across the
03:31:03.48 --> 03:31:08.76 battlefield the dead body rose suddenly to throw a grenade or shoot it us some Japanese jumped
03:31:08.76 --> 03:31:14.04 to their feet and tried to run away we shot them all just shot them all right down no prisoners
03:31:14.04 --> 03:31:19.40 were taken we moved forward at a steady pace hardly breaking a stride rarely halting we just kept
03:31:19.40 --> 03:31:24.68 walking through the killing ground looking around scrutinizing the bodies firing at the Japanese
03:31:24.68 --> 03:31:30.04 are coming to a probably under dead probably at least a hundred and we we we we had only
03:31:30.04 --> 03:31:41.000 a couple of wounded as well we had that process yeah that was a large of stuff the war
03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:47.88 that was what that was a large of sponsi counter attack of the war see if they were given
03:31:47.88 --> 03:31:53.40 no objective to just keep going keep going it gives many of us as possible until they're
03:31:53.40 --> 03:31:59.24 in the end of the house lost their life and and the two two commanders they they
03:31:59.24 --> 03:32:04.52 committed very carry before started and one was the one the gumo was the one the lead to attack
03:32:04.52 --> 03:32:16.12 on Pearl Harbor now gumo and then we finally get to the last campaign a little a little
03:32:16.12 --> 03:32:23.24 over three miles south of siphon sent tinian twelve miles long six miles across it's widest point
03:32:23.48 --> 03:32:28.12 and this was your oh this is really something too that first night
03:32:34.68 --> 03:32:40.60 one eight landed late that afternoon yeah the second division unit involved the only the only
03:32:40.60 --> 03:32:44.76 second division unit involved the jday operations the regiment quickly established a reserve
03:32:44.76 --> 03:32:48.92 position behind the beach has perimeter digging in and string barbed wire and anticipation
03:32:48.92 --> 03:32:54.44 of enemy counter attack all moving around the perimeter. All of it's 200 miles 200 to 100 foot
03:32:54.44 --> 03:33:00.28 to 200 yards wide beach they had no idea they were going to be up there they thought we
03:33:00.28 --> 03:33:05.56 got land down down there the main town which was called a well-known called san Jose
03:33:05.56 --> 03:33:10.28 you guys fainted you could there's a fake we did a fake but we had a battle shed hip hit
03:33:10.28 --> 03:33:15.56 it was a lot of damage and lost lies from counter counter fire counter battery fire.
03:33:15.56 --> 03:33:20.92 This was for me and many other second division marines the fourth combat operation in just 18
03:33:20.92 --> 03:33:26.52 months the three previous guadal canal tarua and siphon had all been difficult each in its own way
03:33:26.52 --> 03:33:31.24 taking enormous physical and emotional toll on all the survivors most of us have been wounded at
03:33:31.24 --> 03:33:38.52 least once all of us have been sick. Now somewhere we're you're going to get to the point where
03:33:38.52 --> 03:33:46.84 we had to at night go over and head off the Japanese that we're attacking our artillery and
03:33:46.84 --> 03:33:53.64 they're we're you know you don't know and I'll tell you about it if you don't see yeah yeah
03:33:53.64 --> 03:34:00.76 the thing that's interesting about this is I mean just you guys having been through
03:34:00.76 --> 03:34:05.80 everything that you'd been through at this point I mean the mentality going into this you know
03:34:05.80 --> 03:34:09.40 you say here the air force could have dropped bushels of purple hearts on our front line units
03:34:09.40 --> 03:34:12.92 and every marine who grabbed on what had deserved it. Okay now they're talking the
03:34:13.64 --> 03:34:18.76 napal was dropped the first time to war on on tinian probably before we landed.
03:34:20.76 --> 03:34:24.68 Yeah you said you said then the aircraft used napal bombs something you do us we
03:34:24.68 --> 03:34:29.000 watching amazement as the bombs fell earth were tumbling and over and an exploded on a ridge
03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:34.20 that instantly erupted in flames and oily smoke along its entire length about 10 seconds later
03:34:34.20 --> 03:34:39.64 gust of hot air from the ledge blew us over. Next day first batiny elements moved up on the
03:34:39.64 --> 03:34:44.44 ridge and poked around the scorched landscape most of the undergrowth had been burned away.
03:34:44.44 --> 03:34:48.84 The ground was black and reaped of gasoline and the foxholes were filled with the corpses of
03:34:48.84 --> 03:34:55.64 Japanese soldiers blackened and shriveled by the incinerating fires. Yeah first use in napal?
03:34:57.88 --> 03:35:01.88 What was the other section that you were talking about? Okay right I'll tell you in the
03:35:01.88 --> 03:35:12.60 day the island of secure. August 2nd here I'm a company commander. We reached the next the last
03:35:12.60 --> 03:35:18.52 bit the beach you know looking down over the cliff and when that one we returned there when
03:35:18.52 --> 03:35:26.20 they're in March of this year we looked from the south side of that beach where the civilians
03:35:26.20 --> 03:35:34.92 all jumped and killed themselves and looked up across and my company was spread from about halfway
03:35:34.92 --> 03:35:42.92 up to clear to that point and we had we had we had both go out with a bullhorn to form the surrender
03:35:42.92 --> 03:35:47.24 and gave them all the made of they didn't so then we fired them machine guns and martyrs at them
03:35:47.24 --> 03:35:54.76 and they all jumped off off the point this side of it and hunters jumped off their des.
03:35:54.76 --> 03:36:02.28 And then that night we were spread out so long so so thinly we decided I'll talk to my
03:36:03.48 --> 03:36:08.12 my company exactly that time and what's we do at long and so you're just going to have to have
03:36:08.12 --> 03:36:12.60 strong points figure where they're likely to come through. So we did and we looked out they tried to
03:36:12.60 --> 03:36:23.000 come through right a strong point so we'll let but anyway these the then we had to send people down
03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:27.24 and try to get them out of the caves down below us there are a lot of civilians in there.
03:36:29.08 --> 03:36:32.20 So were the civilians out where they were they staying with the with the with the with the
03:36:32.20 --> 03:36:36.76 no they're by themselves families. Yeah the were families one not to run there they're
03:36:36.76 --> 03:36:43.000 even the same cave some soldiers were them yeah yeah and eventually you could say here the
03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:50.84 Japanese I mean and again this we're jumping through all kinds of you know just crazy combat
03:36:50.84 --> 03:36:56.60 and then you get to a point where the Japanese had no no more fight left of them they were ready to die
03:36:57.16 --> 03:37:01.08 if not yet call it quits for the most part they went on. Okay then what happened you see when
03:37:01.08 --> 03:37:06.84 I when I told you right after we landed the first night and here we got here we got we got
03:37:06.84 --> 03:37:14.36 we got got a message that our artillery was being being overrun by our other Japanese and so we
03:37:14.36 --> 03:37:20.92 had here's that for dark and probably around midnight and here we here as a tiny I was a
03:37:20.92 --> 03:37:29.88 company exact and I took up 200 or maybe two Patoons and we went single file to former sliders
03:37:29.88 --> 03:37:35.72 from the front of the artillery well that's great dangers because anybody walking around is
03:37:35.72 --> 03:37:41.80 going to get going to get the enemy you know right well then I went when morning came here there were
03:37:41.80 --> 03:37:48.04 all kinds of shovels out there and there was Japanese and here we had the our line of scrimmers
03:37:48.04 --> 03:37:53.80 had to go forward oh this is going to be horrible the air in fox though they're in holes and we're
03:37:53.80 --> 03:38:02.04 not not a lawnmower shot at us as we came up very close with an less than 100 feet or so I
03:38:02.04 --> 03:38:08.92 just put a hand grenade shoot kill themselves bang bang 100 and kill themselves as we walk forward
03:38:08.92 --> 03:38:14.68 and we only had a couple of men wounded so we had and why they didn't shoot back I don't understand
03:38:15.40 --> 03:38:21.72 we're in all of them were given orders not to thank you in the air hurry wow
03:38:22.92 --> 03:38:29.64 what a relief what a relief so going back to the book here and again I'm jumping through
03:38:29.64 --> 03:38:36.04 some incredible stories but Tinian was declared secure on one August first Patan pulled back
03:38:36.04 --> 03:38:41.48 about a mile from the coast and set up camp the end of the fighting was very abrupt suddenly we didn't
03:38:41.48 --> 03:38:46.60 have anything to do there was no enemy activity in the immediate area no danger no shooting I just
03:38:46.60 --> 03:38:51.88 sat back and tried to enjoy the situation that this wasn't as easy as you might think I was exhausted
03:38:51.88 --> 03:38:57.40 and filled with a lingering dread a sense that I'd used up all my lives I had I had been
03:38:57.40 --> 03:39:01.32 become conditioned to wondering whether I was going to survive another day and then all of a sudden
03:39:01.32 --> 03:39:07.000 all the causes for concern had vanished as though I had been given a reprieve from a death sentence
03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:11.96 I could hardly believe it a strange feeling I didn't have long to dwell on it a few days later
03:39:11.96 --> 03:39:18.92 I received orders to return to the states 32 months after leaving San Diego I was going home
03:39:21.48 --> 03:39:26.44 three weeks later at Pearl Harbor where I'd been marking time in the transit center I'd
03:39:26.44 --> 03:39:32.36 boarded a giant Martin Mars flying boat for the final leg of the flight that was oh my gosh
03:39:33.56 --> 03:39:39.96 well landed in Patan when he called that place I can't think we're now in Berkeley
03:39:39.96 --> 03:39:44.12 what is it like? Alameda Alameda Alameda Alameda Naval Air Station
03:39:44.12 --> 03:39:48.28 everyone on board service men from every branch returning home watching outer silence as the golden
03:39:48.28 --> 03:39:55.32 gate bridge passed beneath I reported to a marine facility was granted 32 day furlough one for every month of
03:39:55.32 --> 03:40:01.000 overseas duty later that day I visited a barber shop while I was sitting in the chair one of the
03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:05.72 patrons began bitching about the terrible state of things in the country I listened to him for a while
03:40:05.72 --> 03:40:10.68 and then I exploded you don't know what terrible is I told him he shut up after that
03:40:11.48 --> 03:40:15.64 you know talk about the woman ran to the what the woman ran into oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
03:40:15.64 --> 03:40:20.84 yes the best I picked up that was your first time in the female marine yeah yeah and you know
03:40:20.84 --> 03:40:28.04 because they brought the women in now they could form a six division but taking all them in
03:40:28.04 --> 03:40:35.72 they had clerical type of work take them out put them in combat right this is the thing that's crazy
03:40:35.72 --> 03:40:39.88 for me to think about here is you know you just have one line it says the war wasn't over right
03:40:40.52 --> 03:40:46.36 and this is 1944 the war wasn't over and as you talked about earlier the thought was that
03:40:46.36 --> 03:40:53.48 you know America was gonna have to invade every island until you got right into Tokyo and since you
03:40:53.48 --> 03:41:00.20 had seen the the how how steadfast the Japanese were you all just thought yeah I might be home for
03:41:00.20 --> 03:41:05.000 year but I'll be back over there as a as a battalion executive officer and a battalion officer or
03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.88 whatever you know all my friends that came back and they they ended back up
03:41:09.88 --> 03:41:17.32 keeping preparing preparing for that so about a year you spend at Kwanico at the basics school
03:41:17.32 --> 03:41:22.36 teaching the young marine that and and the first what called PCS tuned commander school
03:41:22.84 --> 03:41:27.56 I went through the first as a captain and then I went through orientation crashed
03:41:27.56 --> 03:41:31.16 because I became an instructor you see okay so they sent you through a school
03:41:31.16 --> 03:41:35.80 they sent you to a commander even though you'd already been a company commander in combat yeah yeah yeah
03:41:35.80 --> 03:41:42.44 so anyway I don't know the academics of it basically and well and then now it's a
03:41:42.44 --> 03:41:48.76 commander then the next I'm a commander the at the basic school and here I have a
03:41:48.76 --> 03:41:56.44 battalion of a second of tennis just recent graduates in naval academy and a battalion senior
03:41:56.44 --> 03:42:03.08 NCOs and none of them wanted to continue they just wanted to retire at their rank you know
03:42:03.08 --> 03:42:09.64 you're going to be back to a second lieutenant and I never forget when the first things I had to do
03:42:09.64 --> 03:42:16.68 was keep my little extra on formal guard mouth and I never been the formal guard and I told them
03:42:16.68 --> 03:42:22.44 I told these guys I said I never I've been a combat almost as time and I've been a formal guard mouth
03:42:22.44 --> 03:42:28.36 since I I had a felt presentation to move it felled around you know they didn't give me a bad
03:42:28.36 --> 03:42:33.40 time they'd all they'd all been through it you know but I never never had been through it you know
03:42:33.40 --> 03:42:38.20 and I told them major about it and said he told me said you figured out you figured out
03:42:40.20 --> 03:42:41.64 no
03:42:42.68 --> 03:42:47.56 here we go on August 15th after night of devastating bonding raids bombing raids on eight
03:42:47.56 --> 03:42:50.92 Japanese cities the Japanese announced their intention for surrender yeah
03:42:50.92 --> 03:42:54.68 for Americans and most of the and this is after obviously the bomb yeah you know
03:42:54.68 --> 03:43:00.36 um for Americans and the rest of the world the announcement signaled the end of World War two
03:43:00.36 --> 03:43:04.44 even though the formal surrender didn't take place until the second second of September
03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:09.96 a few weeks later our classes were terminated in orders were cut by thousands to release
03:43:09.96 --> 03:43:14.68 men from active duty I was asked whether I wanted to stay on and take a regular commission in
03:43:14.68 --> 03:43:19.08 the Marine Corps I was tempted I'd started as a private made it all the way up to Captain at age
03:43:19.08 --> 03:43:24.36 24 no small achievement and then was the potential for further advancement in the postwar corps
03:43:24.36 --> 03:43:30.12 at first I said yes and signed my the requisite papers but after sleeping on I changed my mind
03:43:30.12 --> 03:43:33.96 the next day I would do my papers shortly thereafter I was released from active duty
03:43:33.96 --> 03:43:39.80 I bought a 1940 crisis or convertible yeah and an octobre hydrovocross country to spook a
03:43:39.80 --> 03:43:46.84 yeah yeah five day journey yeah and then then I went to work at the H1th of college
03:43:47.40 --> 03:43:52.68 I went to work for North American aviation and there was there for six years
03:43:52.68 --> 03:44:02.04 and then lucky there was there for 23 years and I was on primarily on the exploration space you
03:44:02.04 --> 03:44:07.40 know I was involved with the first the first flights to Mars and the first fly by
03:44:08.04 --> 03:44:15.24 it was a failure we provided the vehicle that did the injection took it to it and it was going to
03:44:15.24 --> 03:44:21.32 as it flow by and then take pictures of it's blue by and also provided the shroud that protected it
03:44:21.32 --> 03:44:28.04 get now the atmosphere well the shroud outcast and blew up and here I had to take a technician
03:44:28.04 --> 03:44:34.36 down to JPL who would provide the spacecraft and and then then that had to take down a half was
03:44:34.36 --> 03:44:41.32 shroud and they put it in temperature out of two chamber it did blow up and I had to go back and tell
03:44:41.32 --> 03:44:48.52 our engineering people hey it did blow up and this all no it couldn't there's just they just
03:44:48.52 --> 03:44:55.000 convinced you did no it did blow up so then we had to work like the next the next launch
03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:59.80 next launch window was just matter a couple months later so we built a different kind of
03:44:59.80 --> 03:45:05.24 different construction and it made it from then on I was involved and all kinds of involved
03:45:05.24 --> 03:45:11.88 with with the with the tech pictures of the moon where they uh Boeing provided space
03:45:11.88 --> 03:45:16.52 to get we provided the means of getting there and then astronauts when they prepared to land
03:45:16.52 --> 03:45:23.56 the moon will they their practice meeting with our spacecraft that kind of stuff yeah and one time
03:45:23.56 --> 03:45:29.000 one time and then I became the I became the president of the management association about 3000
03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:39.72 members and one time we had we had uh put this name uh the first on the moon um Armstrong Neil Armstrong
03:45:39.72 --> 03:45:44.60 he spoke to us and I asked him a question we had about seven hundred people in our tennis
03:45:44.60 --> 03:45:49.16 and he asked him a question and says sometimes you look up there at nighttime and he has to kind
03:45:49.16 --> 03:45:54.20 of pinch yourself I was really there can you imagine can you imagine what his answer was
03:45:54.20 --> 03:45:56.84 I have no idea his answer was I've learned to live with it
03:46:00.04 --> 03:46:05.72 and just brought down the house oh she and then what you when did you get married when you have kids
03:46:05.72 --> 03:46:27.08 uh that was in uh just a minute 40 47 yeah and uh I mean this this book is just like I said
03:46:27.08 --> 03:46:33.48 I've read a fraction of it probably read less than 10% of it tonight the the amount of
03:46:33.48 --> 03:46:38.92 information the amount of detail the stories are just okay now this is unbelievable this is
03:46:38.92 --> 03:46:44.04 when you get that one and it's entirely different this is based on interviews by a very
03:46:44.04 --> 03:46:51.000 and this is based on some talking to people but mostly I'm talking to the natives I'm talking
03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:58.12 to Japanese uh I'm describing what what it's like now what the landscape is like all in the
03:46:58.12 --> 03:47:03.000 pre-lying around so it's almost like this book should have been written first and should have been written second
03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:07.88 well I don't know you see see the thing is this is too broad or is this is getting
03:47:07.88 --> 03:47:13.80 not detailed and detailed with the people yeah and that's mentioned in in the in the
03:47:13.80 --> 03:47:17.64 in the prologue or the forward in the forward in the forward that's where it's mentioned that's
03:47:17.64 --> 03:47:23.72 reason it's a different entirely different and I didn't even tend to write this but uh you got
03:47:23.72 --> 03:47:29.16 you know here hit all of these all these tapes and now only that and a little little little
03:47:29.16 --> 03:47:33.80 tape recorder and the one's Japanese are in two acute and he was doing the same thing so
03:47:33.80 --> 03:47:39.48 anything I said he was recording or I'm saying so on and so that's when it said okay that was
03:47:39.48 --> 03:47:47.16 82 then 85 183 a tickle group out as a tour guide then 85 I went I went to japan went on
03:47:47.16 --> 03:47:54.92 space A and so here I entered you and that was that was really interesting I'll tell you this guy
03:47:54.92 --> 03:48:00.84 this guy Tani he told me all or the space we've had yassikuni shrine and the you know the
03:48:01.64 --> 03:48:08.76 in person if he had less than all that kind of stuff and just a lot and then went into a
03:48:08.76 --> 03:48:14.28 a TV studio and all that kind of stuff is incredible and any any point or doubt you know
03:48:14.28 --> 03:48:21.40 I think it was so fire bomb you know it all this is all new all new but then everyone is so friendly
03:48:21.40 --> 03:48:27.32 to me you know just couldn't believe it yeah then he built he built a he built a you know a battleship
03:48:28.60 --> 03:48:36.28 that was the Japanese battleship that had it's shilled Guadalcanale he made it and it would
03:48:36.28 --> 03:48:43.24 it was radio controlled and it would fly even it would fire from the guns with a photo flash flash out
03:48:43.96 --> 03:48:50.36 and he had in his garage and his eight foot long is the same size is the actual drawings of the
03:48:51.40 --> 03:49:00.52 of the battleship so he made it the same size okay and now he he came down with cancer
03:49:00.52 --> 03:49:07.88 and we we of course one with a 15 years and so then he wanted to hear he had the same what should
03:49:07.88 --> 03:49:13.40 I do it said well you know there's there's the museum back in Kalamazoo
03:49:14.44 --> 03:49:20.04 Guadalcanale battles and he did he sent it back there and send a museum now
03:49:20.04 --> 03:49:24.28 oh wow yeah I have a picture of him in my book here summer
03:49:24.28 --> 03:49:30.92 well and then here have a lot of that a lot of little cartoons he drew I'd say what happened here
03:49:31.72 --> 03:49:37.08 and so he drew out he drew it out this is this is what happened or he'd send me something about here
03:49:38.28 --> 03:49:44.44 here he is just starving there and now here he's dreaming of a meal that later on he will
03:49:44.44 --> 03:49:52.04 had stuff like that it's just incredible well this stuff is is amazing these these this
03:49:52.04 --> 03:49:56.92 book is like I said this book is awesome thanks to my co-author he know he know how to craft it
03:49:56.92 --> 03:50:02.04 all I did was hey yeah this is correct yeah yeah oh well there's more of this there's a little
03:50:02.04 --> 03:50:08.28 more here and there's not the main the main was on site pan I just I had some doubts because
03:50:09.16 --> 03:50:14.28 he had he did believe in some conspiracy theories about other things that's reason I was concerned
03:50:14.28 --> 03:50:20.52 but overall it was okay it was good well it's like I said it's an incredible book to read I
03:50:20.52 --> 03:50:26.28 know I've had you here for just about four hours talking but I wanted to I wanted to kind of close
03:50:26.28 --> 03:50:30.60 it out with one last thing one last section of the book and you already kind of mentioned it a
03:50:30.60 --> 03:50:36.52 little bit but the way it's written is just just such a fitting close to this is not the guy
03:50:36.52 --> 03:50:45.32 that's the life yeah and so it says this on October on on 22 November 1993 the 50th anniversary
03:50:45.32 --> 03:50:51.72 of the bout for Taroa I tended this ceremony in yorkers New York to be dedicate here you go
03:50:51.72 --> 03:50:57.88 Anthony O'Boyle Memorial Park in the name of the fallen private from my pontoon he was well known
03:50:57.88 --> 03:51:03.96 there in that town also attending where Anthony's good friends and foxhole buddies yeah
03:51:03.96 --> 03:51:10.92 Bill Crumpacker said it right yeah he was with a dickstein yeah our company commander John Merck
03:51:10.92 --> 03:51:18.04 and several other Taroa vet as well as a member as a number of high-ranking Marines
03:51:18.04 --> 03:51:23.56 including Lieutenant John General John J. She hand he bought a herd of a man Jeff yeah
03:51:23.56 --> 03:51:29.64 then a member of the joint chiefs of staff yeah it was a cold gray day with an icy wind blowing
03:51:29.64 --> 03:51:34.36 off the Hudson River yeah quite a contrast to the tropical heat and brilliant sunlight on
03:51:34.36 --> 03:51:40.68 Bezier when Anthony had medicine and yeah shot in the head while peering over the sea wall
03:51:40.68 --> 03:51:46.68 and red beach too Anthony had fallen back into John Murdoch's arms still alive but unconscious
03:51:46.68 --> 03:51:53.88 his body twitching his eyes open but empty John held him for a brief time spoke to him
03:51:53.88 --> 03:51:59.000 and then set him aside on the beach among the bodies of other slain Marines where he died a
03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:06.68 few minutes later all the solemn knees appropriate to the occasion where observed all the
03:52:06.68 --> 03:52:15.24 rights were performed the colors were trouped speeches were giving music was played prayers were offered
03:52:16.60 --> 03:52:23.48 we saying the national anthem the Marine him and amazing grace there was a presentation of
03:52:23.48 --> 03:52:30.20 military testimonials proclamations were made John Murdoch gave a talk about Anthony
03:52:30.92 --> 03:52:36.28 then presented Anthony's brother with the purple heart a fitting gesture from a man who comforted
03:52:36.28 --> 03:52:42.84 Anthony in his final moments of his life and honor guard fired at 21 gun salute
03:52:43.88 --> 03:52:51.16 taps was played we all wept our tears were shed in both sorrow and joy
03:52:51.16 --> 03:52:59.64 there was cause for both Anthony's life had been short his dying heart his glory
03:53:00.52 --> 03:53:10.68 everlasting there was no bitterness no disillusionment no anger his life had mattered
03:53:10.68 --> 03:53:22.20 his death also and we remembered both and knew that both had meaning and purpose the biographical
03:53:22.20 --> 03:53:26.52 sketch in the program for the ceremony expressed the feelings well in this regard
03:53:27.40 --> 03:53:33.56 and serves as a fitting epitaph for every marine in the second world war
03:53:33.56 --> 03:53:41.80 and here's what it read if the world had been different if he had been born at another time
03:53:44.20 --> 03:53:51.24 Anthony with his sunshine smile could have married raised a family had grandchildren
03:53:51.64 --> 03:54:00.60 and lived a quiet typically traditional American life but the early 1940s were not normal times
03:54:00.60 --> 03:54:07.56 a fascist dictator threatened to conquer Europe and forge an alliance with the militarists
03:54:07.56 --> 03:54:13.24 who controlled the Japanese government and they're distorted plan for world domination
03:54:13.24 --> 03:54:19.96 and unprepared and unsuspecting United States became a primary target the American people were
03:54:19.96 --> 03:54:25.56 shocked in the action by the Sunday morning arrival of Japanese bombers over a wahoo
03:54:25.56 --> 03:54:32.12 like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans Anthony felt compelled to volunteer
03:54:32.12 --> 03:54:38.68 to serve his country he simply could not stand aside while America was under attack
03:54:40.68 --> 03:54:47.08 Anthony gave his life on tarua for his country his core and for his fellow Marines
03:54:48.92 --> 03:54:53.08 he was not a famous hero more than a by millions extolled in the press
03:54:53.08 --> 03:55:02.60 immortalized in magazine articles or books he was no one special just another marine private first class
03:55:05.72 --> 03:55:14.36 the American people should thank god eternally for Anthony and his fellow Marines soldiers
03:55:14.36 --> 03:55:22.20 see men and airmen who preserved and won a magnificent victory over a wickedly evil enemy
03:55:24.52 --> 03:55:35.24 semper five brother you are not forgotten and with that Dean Lad has left the building
03:55:36.44 --> 03:55:41.56 and actually who has joined us in the building looks like Jason Gargert, Jason Gargert's randomly
03:55:41.56 --> 03:55:50.92 we are in spokane Washington spokane spokane spokane and since you originally linked me up with
03:55:52.36 --> 03:55:58.20 the Dean Lad on a few random flights somewhere and you saw what was he just wearing like a
03:55:58.20 --> 03:56:03.40 Marine Corps hat sure is one of the Marine Corps hats sitting there and I struck up a conversation
03:56:03.40 --> 03:56:07.16 with them and the next thing you know he's like oh I was like wow what can I tell you
03:56:07.16 --> 03:56:11.96 taro up and I was like holy cow and he goes out and wrote a book about it you don't have to be kidding me
03:56:11.96 --> 03:56:16.20 it was awesome just so funny you text from the flight yeah and that you get so funny because
03:56:16.20 --> 03:56:19.64 you and I were just standing out there talking to him you know how you get you know you and I are
03:56:19.64 --> 03:56:25.08 used to hear in all of our friends say like oh well now it was in Baghdad or when I was in Marsha
03:56:25.08 --> 03:56:29.24 or when I was in wherever I was in Ramadi and we were just standing out there and he's like
03:56:29.24 --> 03:56:36.04 well you know when I was in side pan I was like that's so much better so much cooler than we are
03:56:36.04 --> 03:56:43.88 dang it and that is the most ridiculous what those guys went through is completely ridiculous
03:56:43.88 --> 03:56:53.16 and I know I mean I've since you know with the old breed is kind of the the the the way that I learned
03:56:53.16 --> 03:56:59.96 like what those guys went through sledge Eugene sledge but this book is just right out right
03:56:59.96 --> 03:57:07.000 there with it man it's right there with it and you're just getting gut shot while you're 500
03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:14.60 meters from the beach at tarua yep you there's no way you're gonna live and yet you live and then
03:57:14.60 --> 03:57:20.28 and then guess what you go to Hawaii for six months and then you're hitting the beaches of
03:57:20.28 --> 03:57:25.48 side pan and then you barely survive that and then guess what you're hitting the beaches of
03:57:25.48 --> 03:57:31.64 tinian and by the way all of this is after you were at the wild canal crazy it's completely insane
03:57:31.64 --> 03:57:39.96 and by the way when he got back he got back in 40 August of 44 when he gets back he has like 32 days
03:57:39.96 --> 03:57:47.80 leave one day for every month that he was overseas and then he's like none of those guys thought
03:57:47.80 --> 03:57:54.92 the war was gonna end they just got done literally killing every single Japanese except for 17 on an
03:57:54.92 --> 03:58:00.68 island they all fought to the death and then they think okay there's however many millions left in
03:58:00.68 --> 03:58:04.76 Japan yeah we're gonna have to go kill them all we're gonna have to kill every single one of those people
03:58:05.32 --> 03:58:09.000 that's what they were thinking so he was thinking cool I'm gonna be on short duty back here training
03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:14.28 Marines for a year and then I'll be going back overseas as a as a company commander or as a
03:58:14.28 --> 03:58:22.44 battalion X or whatever totally nuts they came up with a bomb that grew in to perfectly good
03:58:22.44 --> 03:58:29.48 war is what I heard some of you say on this podcast yeah yeah that was that was Jim Kunkill said that
03:58:30.44 --> 03:58:37.48 good so anyways it's it's so awesome that first of all that you manage awesome that I mean it's
03:58:37.48 --> 03:58:41.56 it's just amazing to be able to sit here and talk to these guys and one of the reasons that we're
03:58:41.56 --> 03:58:47.08 able to do this is because of the support that is given to us from you the listener
03:58:47.08 --> 03:58:53.64 sure and what we've tried to do is set something up where you can support not only this podcast so
03:58:53.64 --> 03:58:59.40 that we can continue to go around and talk to the Dean Lads of the world and capture their story
03:59:00.28 --> 03:59:04.68 but also while you're doing that you can support yourself yes while you're on the path
03:59:04.68 --> 03:59:11.72 it's a mutually supporting scenario yes which is a good thing so on the path what's the the first
03:59:11.72 --> 03:59:17.64 thing that comes to mind obviously in my opinion due to so many due to just so many you need to get you get
03:59:17.64 --> 03:59:24.92 and urgent or a genie yeah 100% that was a common question when we started this hey I'm starting
03:59:24.92 --> 03:59:29.48 due to just a good of course that's good what you should I get common question easy no answer
03:59:29.48 --> 03:59:35.32 easy no or if it wasn't for that question we wouldn't even be connected to or it was that question
03:59:35.32 --> 03:59:39.72 and me telling people to buy originies even though I didn't wasn't connected with them yet
03:59:39.72 --> 03:59:45.96 yeah so that's pretty cool to think about so please relax regards yeah I'll just
03:59:45.96 --> 03:59:51.80 be wearing your legs right now by the way like right now some American denim origin jeans what
03:59:51.80 --> 03:59:59.000 are you two Jason Gardner oh we're three right here oh yeah every time I wash them they get better

04:00:05.40 --> 04:00:11.72 which are named after the may-con Delta which is where our forefathers served in Vietnam
04:00:11.72 --> 04:00:17.72 and where our forefathers in the SEAL teams wore blue jeans because they were tougher and way cooler
04:00:20.28 --> 04:00:26.60 so they're like lightweight though so anyways jeans you can get those there to your t-shirts

04:04:28.76 --> 04:04:33.48 origin we didn't say that it was made in america after we just talked for four hours with
04:04:33.48 --> 04:04:39.08 someone that fought to keep america free and then we didn't mention the fact that everything
04:04:39.08 --> 04:04:44.92 in origin is made 100% without compromise in the United States of america yeah that's pretty cool
04:04:44.92 --> 04:04:50.52 just a cotton is grown see yes and that's the part two like you can say yeah 100% made
04:04:50.52 --> 04:04:54.76 had to call these materials and I made them right here in america 100% which isn't even bad
04:04:54.76 --> 04:04:59.08 I'm not even hating on that it's good but we're just like wait wait wait what about the materials though
04:04:59.08 --> 04:05:04.04 you know okay okay I get it man okay all good either way but what about those materials
04:05:05.24 --> 04:05:11.16 you know or the origin materials that's that's grown in america so jockel store

04:05:43.32 --> 04:05:48.52 if you haven't already a contrary to what jockel says I'm not saying you don't
04:05:48.52 --> 04:05:53.16 what do you keep saying that you don't think people subscribe to the podcast you need to
04:05:53.16 --> 04:05:58.44 tell them no so I can't open door if I remember correctly which I probably don't but if I do
04:05:59.000 --> 04:06:05.96 I my initial uh contention was that we don't have to say to subscribe to the podcast we don't have to
04:06:05.96 --> 04:06:11.40 say hey subscribe you know what do we have to say that nothing oh I'll just subscribe to this
04:06:11.40 --> 04:06:16.28 podcast if I like it kind of thing that I think I don't I think that was the whole contention
04:06:16.28 --> 04:06:20.68 nonetheless why is it even there then why are we saying it that's the whole reason I brought it up
04:06:20.68 --> 04:06:24.28 at that time it's like why are we even saying this remember but then we did like
04:06:25.08 --> 04:06:29.88 sent you a message yes that's how that's described that's right yeah so it's like a good reminder
04:06:29.88 --> 04:06:35.16 and then you're like see yeah okay it's all come to see thanks all right so so subscribe to the
04:06:35.16 --> 04:06:38.20 podcast if you want to talk about that if there's also some other podcast one of them
04:06:38.20 --> 04:06:42.84 is called the Warrior Kid podcast which you may or may not know about it's for children it's for parents
04:06:42.84 --> 04:06:46.84 it's for everyone in the world and then we have another podcast oddly enough now
04:06:47.72 --> 04:06:55.000 which is called the grounded podcast grounded podcast yes this I guess you was formulated kind of
04:06:55.000 --> 04:06:59.88 with the offshoots of conversations about your tattoo in life right yeah well here's the thing
04:06:59.88 --> 04:07:03.80 there's some things that we taught that you and I talk about and then that you and I talk about
04:07:03.80 --> 04:07:10.84 with everyone that we know yeah that doesn't quite fit in the purview of jocopotcasts actual yeah
04:07:10.84 --> 04:07:17.32 right like yes the jocopotcasts is for Dean lad yes it's not for Dean's director
04:07:19.32 --> 04:07:25.000 but the Dean has Dean's been on it but like Dean's you know we we we covered the primary
04:07:25.000 --> 04:07:30.12 jocopotcast type stuff from him but Dean has other information for us other things that we talk about
04:07:30.12 --> 04:07:34.84 that that is the perfect way to put it back so there you go so subscribe to those podcasts and

04:10:48.28 --> 04:10:52.28 think that's the best kids book ever written pretty well at least for sure at least I do
04:10:54.28 --> 04:11:01.72 discipline goes freedom field manual you can get that book if you want to get after it and what's
04:11:01.72 --> 04:11:08.44 interesting about that book is there's no book like it and my publisher I was like is this
04:11:08.44 --> 04:11:12.28 the biggest risk you've ever took with published in a book and he's like oh absolutely not even
04:11:12.28 --> 04:11:19.32 close there's no book like it it's totally outside of any other normal book so yes this is a big risk
04:11:19.32 --> 04:11:28.36 but it it outperformed every model of sales that they had created for it like even though that
04:11:28.36 --> 04:11:33.56 well if it really does great it'll be here it I did all that so why word a mouth and you all
04:11:34.12 --> 04:11:37.72 spread the word so thank you discipline because freedom field manual and then of course there is
04:11:37.72 --> 04:11:43.56 extreme ownership and the dichotomy leadership that I wrote with my brother life babbin about
