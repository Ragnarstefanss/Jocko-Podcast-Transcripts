00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.84
This is Jocko podcast number 362 with echo Charles and me.

2
00:00:03.84 --> 00:00:06.32
Jocko willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:06.32 --> 00:00:08.40
So I was an officer candidate school.

4
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:16.56
1998. It's a form of military indoctrination. I was already in the military. I had already

5
00:00:16.56 --> 00:00:20.72
been indoctrinated in the military. So as I was going through it, I could kind of

6
00:00:21.52 --> 00:00:24.72
I was a little bit more detached. You know, I could see a little bit more,

7
00:00:24.72 --> 00:00:29.76
had a little bit more experience. And there's all kinds of procedures and protocols that you

8
00:00:29.76 --> 00:00:34.08
have to follow when you're going to officer candidate school. You got to you got to fold your

9
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:40.88
underwear into a five inch by five inch square for a locker inspection. You've got to they come

10
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:44.32
and measure it with a steel ruler, the drill instructors, Marine Corps drill instructors,

11
00:00:44.32 --> 00:00:49.12
they have a they have like their own personal, you know, some somebody has a possession that

12
00:00:49.12 --> 00:00:53.44
you can see it kind of has a certain level of pride to it. They would have these steel rulers

13
00:00:53.44 --> 00:00:59.28
and slap it down on that thing. And they're going to measure your handkerchief and your t-shirts and

14
00:00:59.28 --> 00:01:05.12
all this stuff. And it's about attention to detail, which is cool about protocols, learning protocols,

15
00:01:05.12 --> 00:01:10.48
and inspecting each other. So as a team, so you might check my locker and we're trying to help

16
00:01:10.48 --> 00:01:15.92
each other out. But one thing that always stuck stuck with me on the protocol level was the belt

17
00:01:15.92 --> 00:01:20.72
buckle that you had. So you could issue this belt buckle. And this belt buckle when you could

18
00:01:20.72 --> 00:01:28.24
issued it, it's shiny gold. And it's it's shiny gold. It's probably brass, actually. But then there's

19
00:01:28.24 --> 00:01:35.84
a clear enamel coat on it. And what that means is you can buy this thing. And it won't just tarnish

20
00:01:35.84 --> 00:01:42.000
because it's got this really strong, clear enamel coat on it's very thin. But that's what keeps it

21
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.08
from tarnishing. But you can still get fingerprints on the enamel. So you could have a belt buckle

22
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:53.76
that has like a fingerprint on it or a smudge on it. So you would wipe them off you, you kind of like

23
00:01:53.76 --> 00:02:01.60
wipe down your your belt buckle. Now here's the thing. At some point, this had evolved to where

24
00:02:02.40 --> 00:02:07.12
you would take your belt buckle that had this enamel on it. And you would polish it

25
00:02:08.24 --> 00:02:15.20
until the enamel was gone. And so now it could tarnish. So you remove the protective layer

26
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:19.44
so that it could tarnish. So something that started as a good idea, which is you buff the

27
00:02:19.44 --> 00:02:26.08
belt buckle so there's no fingerprints on it escalated over time to where you were polishing this

28
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:32.56
thing until all the enamel was removed. And now it would tarnish more easily. And it's actually

29
00:02:32.56 --> 00:02:38.08
hard to take care of now. So this this thing that started with good intent, oh, you're going to

30
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:45.36
make sure there's no fingerprints on it turned into craziness. And people, no one knows where it

31
00:02:45.36 --> 00:02:52.80
started. Like no one knows when it got stupid. And no one knows we ended up when we ended up

32
00:02:52.80 --> 00:02:58.08
at Officer Candidate School making people do something stupid, but we did it. And this can

33
00:02:58.08 --> 00:03:05.20
happen with anything. Now there's a there's a similar term in or I shouldn't say in a similar

34
00:03:05.20 --> 00:03:11.68
situation, there's a term in political discourse called the Overton window. The Overton window,

35
00:03:11.68 --> 00:03:15.76
which was this is originated this term was originated by a guy that was named Joseph

36
00:03:15.76 --> 00:03:24.24
Overton, who is a political scientist and like a libertarian type dude. And he actually died

37
00:03:24.24 --> 00:03:31.20
flying an ultralight at age 43. But this idea of the Overton window is that there's a there's a

38
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:40.56
window in the acceptance of ideas. So ideas go through a transition. So let's say there's an

39
00:03:40.56 --> 00:03:45.60
idea out there, it starts off when the idea first comes to light, it's totally unthinkable,

40
00:03:46.72 --> 00:03:53.92
totally unthinkable, meaning totally unacceptable. And then it actually, as people talk about it

41
00:03:53.92 --> 00:03:59.28
more and it becomes more familiar, it goes from being unthinkable, or totally unacceptable,

42
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:03.68
to just radical. Like so you're not saying, Oh, that's unacceptable. You just saying, Oh,

43
00:04:03.68 --> 00:04:09.92
that's that's pretty radical. And then eventually it moves to being like a fringe idea. But now

44
00:04:09.92 --> 00:04:16.24
it's moving into the acceptable category. Then eventually it becomes acceptable. And then it

45
00:04:16.24 --> 00:04:20.08
becomes sensible. And then it becomes popular. And then it eventually becomes policy.

46
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:28.08
And there's a bunch of things that kind of we've watched go through this evolution. I mean tattoos,

47
00:04:28.72 --> 00:04:38.16
right tattoos years ago tattoos were kind of unacceptable in normal society. It was like bikers.

48
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:46.56
Bikers had tattoos and and convicts had tattoos. It wasn't normal. Now the tattoos are basically

49
00:04:46.56 --> 00:04:56.88
totally acceptable. Long hair for men, which I don't support. But but hey, but long hair for men

50
00:04:56.88 --> 00:05:04.96
in the 1940s totally unacceptable. In the 1950s and 60s, it was in the 50s, it was like radical.

51
00:05:04.96 --> 00:05:17.68
In the 60s, it was like kind of normal. Now it's just acceptable. So as people push the envelope

52
00:05:17.68 --> 00:05:22.88
with behavior, the Overton window expands and things become more acceptable and norms change

53
00:05:22.88 --> 00:05:30.88
over time. And it's also true that as one part of the Overton window opens another part closes. So

54
00:05:30.88 --> 00:05:35.92
if you are firing someone because they had a tattoo or you fired someone because they had

55
00:05:35.92 --> 00:05:40.72
long hair, now that would be unacceptable. The guy had long hair, you can't just fire someone

56
00:05:40.72 --> 00:05:46.24
because they have long hair that would be unacceptable now. So what am I talking about?

57
00:05:46.24 --> 00:05:48.96
How do these two things relate the belt buckle in the Overton window? Well,

58
00:05:51.28 --> 00:05:58.88
it certainly seems to me that as we look at the way society is evolving today,

59
00:05:58.88 --> 00:06:08.64
the Overton window of what's acceptable has expanded and moved so much that

60
00:06:10.64 --> 00:06:17.04
it might not make sense anymore. What some things that are now not only acceptable, but now sort

61
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:21.60
of getting pushed, you wonder if they're if they make sense and maybe they could actually even be

62
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:34.08
harmful. And I think if we if we as people aren't careful, we can kind of slowly drift around inside

63
00:06:34.08 --> 00:06:44.72
that Overton window from the positive of having an open mind to to an extreme to where there's no

64
00:06:44.72 --> 00:06:48.96
more guardrails. There's no more framework and there's no more baseline of what's acceptable

65
00:06:48.96 --> 00:06:58.08
and what's isn't. So a friend of mine, it seems to me has been trying to maintain some kind of

66
00:06:58.08 --> 00:07:05.12
sanity, some kind of rationality to the expansion of the Overton window to apply some baseline to

67
00:07:05.12 --> 00:07:10.80
the world. And I think it's been a pretty good fight for her. I think she's just getting warmed up.

68
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:16.000
She's a former congresswoman. She's a former presidential candidate. She's an army officer.

69
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Iraq war veteran, podcaster, surfer, martial artist and Hawaiian. She's been on this podcast before

70
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.96
episode 272. Her name is Tulsi Gabbard. And it's an honor to have her back with us tonight. Tulsi

71
00:07:32.96 --> 00:07:41.12
Gabbard. Aloha. How's it going? There's been a lot of there's been a lot going on in your world.

72
00:07:41.12 --> 00:07:46.16
Yeah. It's been crazy. It's been kind of crazy to watch when you came on this podcast for the first

73
00:07:46.16 --> 00:07:53.36
time. You were a democratic. I don't know if you were running for president. Were you running for

74
00:07:53.36 --> 00:08:01.84
president at the time? I think if I'm not mistaken, this was in late 2020. I don't know. I should

75
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:08.000
have checked the dates. And so I think the if I'm not mistaken, I think the presidential campaign

76
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.52
was finished at that point in time. And we were talking about how it went. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

77
00:08:13.52 --> 00:08:19.84
it's it's always interesting to me because I have some of my friends are dope smoke dope smoking

78
00:08:19.84 --> 00:08:25.60
hippies. Some of them are right wing conservative fundamentalist Christians and everything in

79
00:08:25.60 --> 00:08:31.12
between. And when you came on my podcast, you know, some of the the first time you came on the

80
00:08:31.92 --> 00:08:37.68
some of my super conservative friends were like, yo, why are you giving her a platform? I was like,

81
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:42.24
oh, because she's cool and I like her. And then some of my dope smoking hippie friends were like,

82
00:08:42.24 --> 00:08:49.28
hell, yeah, that's what we're talking about. So you, you know, you you had sort of a,

83
00:08:50.16 --> 00:08:55.36
I think you had a reputation or an image, I think. And you more than that, I think you just get

84
00:08:55.36 --> 00:09:02.32
categorized, right? You were a Democrat at the time, which I know you aren't. Yeah. So what

85
00:09:02.32 --> 00:09:06.000
happened, man? What happened? Let's just talk about that. So you left the Democratic Party.

86
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.68
Yeah. Well, first of all, just say, for as long as I've been in politics, people who like to put

87
00:09:15.68 --> 00:09:21.60
other humans in categories have always had trouble putting me in a category, just because I've always

88
00:09:21.60 --> 00:09:28.08
been a very independent minded person. So, you know, I first ran for office in 2002 in Hawaii.

89
00:09:28.08 --> 00:09:32.96
I was 21 years old, very passionate about environmental issues and protecting the beauty

90
00:09:32.96 --> 00:09:38.48
of our home in Hawaii, the water, oceans, and, and that was my motivation to run for a state house.

91
00:09:39.28 --> 00:09:46.80
And, you know, prior to that point, I had no, like familial political affiliation. There was no,

92
00:09:46.80 --> 00:09:50.72
like, you know, my daddy and granddaddy were Democrats. So I have to be a Democrat. My parents

93
00:09:50.72 --> 00:09:56.16
were very like, Hey, you, you go make your own decisions, figure out, you know, what, what is

94
00:09:56.16 --> 00:10:03.20
your foundational principles? And so at that time, I really had to look because I had, you know,

95
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:06.48
filed a piece of paper saying I'm running for office and there was a box to check like, okay,

96
00:10:06.48 --> 00:10:12.72
fine, what party are you going to run under? And so I started looking at kind of the origins of,

97
00:10:12.72 --> 00:10:19.36
in Hawaii, the Democratic Party, Hawaii had been under the rule of a few very wealthy Republicans

98
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:24.000
since it became a territory of the United States and then later through statehood.

99
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.04
And the shift towards Democratic politics in Hawaii came about because

100
00:10:30.96 --> 00:10:38.88
of plantation workers, people who were being treated like crap, like in, in in humane conditions,

101
00:10:38.88 --> 00:10:46.000
being paid pennies for working super long hours. It was, it was basically like glorified slave labor.

102
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:51.28
And so it was the Democratic Party and the ILWU that came in and was like, no, this is not okay.

103
00:10:51.28 --> 00:10:57.60
And, and so it was the party that in our history in Hawaii was the Big 10 inclusive party. It was

104
00:10:57.60 --> 00:11:03.84
the party for the people. It was the party that stood up against those few very wealthy people

105
00:11:03.84 --> 00:11:09.04
in power and said, no, you can't just abuse people like this. It was the party that stood for

106
00:11:09.04 --> 00:11:13.76
civil liberties and individual freedom and choice like, Hey, whatever your personal choice is,

107
00:11:13.76 --> 00:11:18.80
whether it's free speech or freedom of religion or whatever it is, like, live and let live,

108
00:11:18.80 --> 00:11:22.64
we can disagree without being disagreeable. And so I looked at the party in Hawaii and I looked

109
00:11:22.64 --> 00:11:28.08
at leaders like JFK and Dr. Martin Luther King and I was drawn to the Democratic Party for those

110
00:11:28.08 --> 00:11:33.44
reasons because again, and my, as I looked at Hawaii as like these super rich Republican dudes

111
00:11:33.44 --> 00:11:39.04
have been abusing their power to fill their pockets at the expense of the wellbeing of the people.

112
00:11:40.08 --> 00:11:47.52
And so fast forward, I left the Democrat Party because all of those things that I just talked

113
00:11:47.52 --> 00:11:56.16
about are gone. The leaders of today's Democratic Party don't believe in really individual freedom,

114
00:11:56.16 --> 00:12:00.000
basically what it comes down to. And you look at that freedom of choice, freedom of speech,

115
00:12:01.04 --> 00:12:08.64
freedom of religion, and you know, there's a lot of other issues that I could get into. But

116
00:12:08.64 --> 00:12:17.20
ultimately, how do you have a political party that's in power that doesn't believe in freedom and is

117
00:12:17.20 --> 00:12:23.28
actively taking action to undermine our constitution and Bill of Rights? And that was really what was

118
00:12:23.28 --> 00:12:29.92
at the crux of Y-Left, the Democrat Party. Was there a straw that broke the camel's back?

119
00:12:31.44 --> 00:12:37.36
There wasn't one single moment, but it was really over the last like few years, two,

120
00:12:37.36 --> 00:12:49.60
three years seeing this increasing, like quickly escalating towards policies coming from our

121
00:12:49.60 --> 00:12:54.40
government that really frankly, we're becoming increasingly authoritarian. And so, you know,

122
00:12:54.40 --> 00:13:00.16
it caused me to kind of spend time reflecting and being introspective like, wait, hold on a second.

123
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:04.40
And people saying like, how can you still be, how can you call yourself a Democrat? And I was

124
00:13:04.40 --> 00:13:09.12
obviously, like I said, I've always been an independent minded person. I've been critical

125
00:13:09.12 --> 00:13:16.08
of people in power, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, and also complimentary when I felt

126
00:13:16.08 --> 00:13:23.84
like they did things that were good for the country. But, you know, looking at the dangerous

127
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:30.24
combination of what we've seen over the last few years, especially of people in power who don't

128
00:13:30.24 --> 00:13:34.16
believe in the Constitution, who openly question things like the First Amendment and right to

129
00:13:34.16 --> 00:13:40.56
free speech coupled with, oh, by the way, they control and are politicizing agencies like

130
00:13:40.56 --> 00:13:46.32
the Department of Justice and the FBI and Department of Homeland Security sickening the

131
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:51.92
domestic newly formed domestic terror unit of the Department of Homeland Security on parents,

132
00:13:51.92 --> 00:13:55.36
like protesting at board of education meetings, because they're like, well, we don't agree with

133
00:13:55.36 --> 00:14:02.16
what you guys are trying to teach our young kids at school. And to see that playing out before our

134
00:14:02.16 --> 00:14:10.24
eyes and this culture of fear, where if you speak out against this stuff and call it for what it is,

135
00:14:11.76 --> 00:14:19.52
you are immediately labeled anti authority and also therefore coming from our government

136
00:14:19.52 --> 00:14:25.44
an extremist and a potential threat, a potential domestic threat. And so that's why you're talking

137
00:14:25.44 --> 00:14:30.000
about the the Overton window and you and you look at like, okay, well, you take people having open

138
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.76
minds and like, okay, well, I can consider, you know, someone else's perspective, even if I don't

139
00:14:33.76 --> 00:14:39.12
agree with it, which is how things should be in general. And then you take it to that next level

140
00:14:39.12 --> 00:14:43.84
where you're saying, well, there are no guardrails anymore. And this is what's so dangerous is when

141
00:14:43.84 --> 00:14:49.44
you have, again, people are entitled to their own opinions. But when you have people in positions

142
00:14:49.44 --> 00:14:58.64
of power in this country, who deny the existence of objective truth as they are, then where is,

143
00:14:58.64 --> 00:15:02.96
like, where's the floor? Where's the guardrails? Where's the ceiling? How do you measure anything?

144
00:15:02.96 --> 00:15:08.64
Well, it's like, okay, well, whatever's true is whatever they say is true. But then what happens

145
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:13.04
when when they're gone and the next person or group of people come in or the next party and then

146
00:15:13.04 --> 00:15:20.000
what if they don't agree with what that group says is true or false? And so and then you couple

147
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.96
that with the fear factor and cancel culture and and people literally seeing what happens to people

148
00:15:24.96 --> 00:15:30.16
like me, where you you just say like, hey, well, this is what's happening. And it's crazy. It's

149
00:15:30.16 --> 00:15:36.96
insane. And then I get called all kinds of names and all kinds of stuff, all kinds of attacks.

150
00:15:36.96 --> 00:15:42.40
And so no wonder so many people are afraid to do the equivalent of like, yeah, obviously,

151
00:15:42.40 --> 00:15:46.80
the emperor has no clothes, like we can all see it. And there's a lot of concern about what's

152
00:15:46.80 --> 00:15:51.68
happening. But so few people feel like they have the ability to speak up without being worried

153
00:15:51.68 --> 00:15:58.24
about losing their job or being shunned by friends or family members or being like that crazy person.

154
00:16:01.04 --> 00:16:04.48
And so this is this is kind of one thing that's been that's been interesting and

155
00:16:05.04 --> 00:16:10.96
and hope inspiring is is, you know, I put out this this kind of long and in depth statement

156
00:16:10.96 --> 00:16:15.84
talking about some of these very specific examples of what's wrong with today's Democrat party.

157
00:16:16.40 --> 00:16:21.44
And I've been hearing from a lot of people, people I know, a lot of people I don't know,

158
00:16:21.44 --> 00:16:28.64
in person on social media, people just saying like, like in a really serious and heavy kind of way,

159
00:16:28.64 --> 00:16:33.28
thank you for bringing voice to the things that I've been feeling and frustrated with. And but,

160
00:16:33.28 --> 00:16:41.12
you know, haven't been able to give voice to. And so my hope is that, you know, the more we speak

161
00:16:41.12 --> 00:16:48.72
up, the more people feel as though they can speak up. And yeah, how do we protect people?

162
00:16:48.72 --> 00:16:52.000
How do we protect our freedoms that are under attack by exercising them?

163
00:16:52.96 --> 00:16:58.40
Yeah, I was, you know, I was like to like cover a book on this podcast. Yeah. What when you were

164
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:04.16
coming on, I said, I was thinking about covering the book Rules for Radicals by Saul Linsky.

165
00:17:05.12 --> 00:17:10.56
This is a book, you know, this is a guy that this is a book that Hillary Clinton wrote her

166
00:17:10.56 --> 00:17:17.20
thesis on when she graduated from college. But there's some of those rules. One of the one of

167
00:17:17.20 --> 00:17:23.04
the rules is hold them to their own rules, right? And that's what you're talking about when you say,

168
00:17:24.32 --> 00:17:28.64
hey, this is America, we have an open mind. And so you go, okay, cool, then you have to accept

169
00:17:28.64 --> 00:17:32.56
everything. Right? That's like one of those things. You can't say anything negative about

170
00:17:32.56 --> 00:17:39.28
anybody anytime, or you're, you're not following your own rules. You're something phobic, right?

171
00:17:39.28 --> 00:17:43.44
Everything is something phobic. You just add whatever it is at the beginning of it. Yeah.

172
00:17:43.44 --> 00:17:49.92
And another one of the rules that he talks about is the power of ridicule. So when you just go on

173
00:17:50.72 --> 00:17:57.20
an obliterating attack on a person, it's overwhelming for them and it works and it's worked a lot

174
00:17:57.20 --> 00:18:05.68
to shut people down and shut them up. And that's, you can see some of these the way that these

175
00:18:06.24 --> 00:18:09.76
rules are implemented. And that's another thing. You know, as I talk about that,

176
00:18:09.76 --> 00:18:14.08
that belt buckle thing, and you don't know where it came from. And there's a bunch of things like

177
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:16.88
that in the middle. There's a bunch of traditions. You go, why do we, this is stupid? Why are we

178
00:18:16.88 --> 00:18:22.40
doing this? And you, and people don't really know where it came from. And I think some of the things

179
00:18:22.40 --> 00:18:28.16
that are going on with society right now, if you start to pull the thread on where it actually

180
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:35.44
initiated, a lot of it did initiate in like the radicals, the communists in the 60s that were

181
00:18:35.44 --> 00:18:43.12
trying to make their impact. And I honestly don't think a lot of people that are fully on that,

182
00:18:43.12 --> 00:18:47.60
on board with that program know where it came from today. They're just doing what they kind of

183
00:18:47.60 --> 00:18:53.36
learned. Because that was, you know, a big goal was to take over the universities, which obviously

184
00:18:53.36 --> 00:18:57.04
they did a pretty good job, pretty good job taking over the universities. What is it? The

185
00:18:57.04 --> 00:19:03.60
universities vote 99, something like 99% democratic in universities. That's obviously,

186
00:19:03.60 --> 00:19:06.40
you're not going to get a very balanced education if that's what you're going through.

187
00:19:07.20 --> 00:19:11.36
And then the scary thing is, and this is another thing we've talked about a bit on this podcast,

188
00:19:12.40 --> 00:19:25.20
and is the, just the complete plasticity of people's brains and how people, you get into

189
00:19:25.20 --> 00:19:29.36
an echo chamber or you get, you start following and listening to certain things.

190
00:19:29.36 --> 00:19:36.48
It's going to take over your mind. And that's really, really scary. And, you know, I've been

191
00:19:36.48 --> 00:19:41.60
saying lately, like, everyone's getting brainwashed. I'm getting brainwashed right now. Like, that's

192
00:19:41.60 --> 00:19:45.44
what's happening. If you're watching, if you're listening, if you're opening your mind and letting

193
00:19:45.44 --> 00:19:49.76
other things in there, you're gaining brainwashed. And that's what's happening to everybody all the

194
00:19:49.76 --> 00:19:53.68
time. That's what, I mean, it's sort of like, it's a combination of brainwashing and learning,

195
00:19:53.68 --> 00:19:57.44
right? If you're learning, you're kind of getting brainwashed. You're bringing in new ideas.

196
00:19:57.44 --> 00:20:06.32
But then you see people that are learning ideas that aren't, essentially, they're not good.

197
00:20:06.32 --> 00:20:13.20
They're not healthy. And it's very, very disturbing. And especially nowadays, where

198
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:18.64
that brainwashing is in your pocket. And at any moment, you can pull it out and you can,

199
00:20:18.64 --> 00:20:26.16
you can get brainwashed at any moment. And it's really, really scary. And especially, you know,

200
00:20:26.16 --> 00:20:34.000
the, the moldability of children. Yeah. 14 year olds, 12 year olds, 19 years old.

201
00:20:34.64 --> 00:20:38.96
You know, it's like when I joined the military, you're going to get brainwashed to some level.

202
00:20:39.92 --> 00:20:45.20
I got in trouble when I went to boot camp. Well, actually, I actually, I didn't get in

203
00:20:45.20 --> 00:20:51.28
trouble because they didn't know who said it. They, we had to fill out a form like about how

204
00:20:51.28 --> 00:20:55.36
boot camp was going, but it was anonymous. And they wrote something like, you know, what do you

205
00:20:55.36 --> 00:21:00.96
think of the program so far? And I wrote, the brainwashing has been very effective. That's what

206
00:21:00.96 --> 00:21:10.000
I wrote. How old are you at the time? 19, 18 or 19. And, you know, it's because I had a very

207
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.40
rebellious mind, you know, because I was like, what was I brainwashed by? I was brainwashed

208
00:21:14.40 --> 00:21:19.84
before I joined the military by hardcore music and punk rock and like anti authoritarianism.

209
00:21:20.40 --> 00:21:24.32
And so for me, they were trying to hit me with that stuff. And I kind of had some good resistance

210
00:21:24.32 --> 00:21:28.32
to it. So I kind of like, oh, they're trying to brainwash me. And then I kind of made a joke

211
00:21:28.32 --> 00:21:32.72
about it. The brainwashing has been, you know, effective thus far, which that's what they're

212
00:21:32.72 --> 00:21:36.80
trying to do. They're trying to get you to like change your brain a little bit and think in a

213
00:21:36.80 --> 00:21:43.52
different way. And, and, but at least I think, I think I always had that rebellious streak in me

214
00:21:43.52 --> 00:21:48.88
that always questions everything. And to this day, when I see something online, I'm like, oh,

215
00:21:48.88 --> 00:21:52.56
what's their angle? Yeah, what's the angle over there? Because there's, everyone's got an angle.

216
00:21:52.56 --> 00:22:00.24
Everyone does. Which is, which is disturbing. And so this is what's happening now with kids.

217
00:22:00.24 --> 00:22:06.32
And you can see it. And it's sad. Yeah, it's so sad to see. I listened to a podcast that you did

218
00:22:07.44 --> 00:22:13.52
on your podcast, which is called the Tulsi Cabaret show with, was it called D transitioning?

219
00:22:13.52 --> 00:22:20.56
Yeah, with Chloe Cole. That was horrifying. Exactly. It was absolutely horrifying. Give us

220
00:22:20.56 --> 00:22:26.32
a quick brief on her. So Chloe Cole, and I'm glad you mentioned that because it's a perfect example

221
00:22:26.32 --> 00:22:33.20
of what you're talking about here. She grew up in here in California. She was a tomboy as a kid

222
00:22:33.20 --> 00:22:40.24
growing up. Love playing video games, love hanging out with her brothers. And at 11 years old, she

223
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:48.48
got a smartphone. Started an Instagram account. She was a tomboy, didn't have many female friends,

224
00:22:48.48 --> 00:22:55.60
didn't really fit in much at school. So was looking for some kind of companionship friendship,

225
00:22:55.60 --> 00:23:03.20
sense of belonging online. And the algorithms on Instagram specifically, she talks about

226
00:23:03.84 --> 00:23:14.48
immediately started feeding her posts and accounts of young girls and women who had,

227
00:23:14.48 --> 00:23:21.20
who are identifying as boys or men who were trans or talking about how much happier they were by

228
00:23:21.20 --> 00:23:26.32
doing so and all of this. And then she had people around her who were telling her, well, like,

229
00:23:26.32 --> 00:23:30.56
if you're not happy as you are, then you're obviously a boy stuck in a girl's body.

230
00:23:32.64 --> 00:23:41.52
I'm going to just be, she's 11, she's 11, 11 years old. Her name is Chloe. At 12 years old,

231
00:23:41.52 --> 00:23:47.76
she told her parents, she wrote them a long letter. And the gist of it was, I am a boy,

232
00:23:48.48 --> 00:23:56.56
and I want you to call me Leo. I encourage you to listen to the story in her voice as she tells it

233
00:23:56.56 --> 00:24:04.000
because it is heartbreaking and so powerful. You watch it on YouTube, you just look into her eyes.

234
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:13.52
She's 18 now. And so, but the summary is she starts taking puberty blockers

235
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:21.44
when she's like 12, 13 years old. And she was very certain about what she wanted to do.

236
00:24:22.32 --> 00:24:28.56
Her parents were naturally pretty confused and not knowing what to do to best care for and love

237
00:24:28.56 --> 00:24:34.24
their daughter. And so they went out and started looking for health professionals to like, hey,

238
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:40.08
just like educate us, talk us through this. What are the, you know, potential medical and health

239
00:24:40.08 --> 00:24:45.92
ramifications of our daughter taking these puberty blockers? And with the exception of one

240
00:24:46.48 --> 00:24:53.28
endocrinologist who told them like, hey, this, we don't know what the negative consequences might be,

241
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:56.64
both in the short term and the long term to this, because there's just, you know, it's not been

242
00:24:56.64 --> 00:25:02.96
studied very well. There's no long history of cases that we can point you to say, well, here's

243
00:25:02.96 --> 00:25:07.84
what you can expect based on fact and science. And so this endocrinologist was saying like,

244
00:25:09.36 --> 00:25:13.60
I would encourage you to think very seriously before doing this because it could end up badly,

245
00:25:13.60 --> 00:25:20.32
essentially. I forget what the name, I think it was a gender specialist was what they were called,

246
00:25:20.32 --> 00:25:26.16
who were helping guide her through this. Every other medical professional that she went to see

247
00:25:26.16 --> 00:25:32.000
basically urged her and encouraged her to move forward with this. And ultimately told

248
00:25:32.96 --> 00:25:41.52
her parents who were expressing some concern and reservations, you have a choice between

249
00:25:41.52 --> 00:25:50.56
having a live son or a dead daughter. And Chloe says that up until that, like at that point,

250
00:25:50.56 --> 00:25:57.92
she had never once had a suicidal thought enter her mind. So this, this warning and essentially

251
00:25:57.92 --> 00:26:05.20
this threat that these medical professionals are giving to this young girl's parents, a live son

252
00:26:05.20 --> 00:26:13.36
or a dead daughter, you decide was based on nothing according to Chloe's medical history.

253
00:26:13.36 --> 00:26:22.48
Fast forward, she ends up getting a double mastectomy when she's 15 years old to continue

254
00:26:22.48 --> 00:26:31.04
this transition. She talks about how they call it top surgery to try to, you know, soften what

255
00:26:31.04 --> 00:26:37.60
it really is. And was after she got that surgery that she had a realization, I think she was 16

256
00:26:37.60 --> 00:26:44.80
at the time that she would know she would never be able to breastfeed her child ever. She, that

257
00:26:44.80 --> 00:26:50.96
had been taken away from her because of this, this decision. And you know, she talks about how she

258
00:26:50.96 --> 00:26:57.68
was asked at different points along this path from when she was 12 through 15, like, okay, well,

259
00:26:57.68 --> 00:27:02.72
here's all these medical disclosures. And, you know, you might not be able to have kids, this could

260
00:27:02.72 --> 00:27:07.04
affect your fertility. And at 12 years old, she's like, man, I don't want kids. Like, how does a

261
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:12.08
12 year old girl make that decision? And then again, at 15 before the surgery, like, okay, well,

262
00:27:12.08 --> 00:27:18.08
you might not be able to do this or have kids or breastfeed. And, you know, again, children not

263
00:27:18.08 --> 00:27:25.12
being equipped to make these decisions at 16, she experienced incredible regret and realized she'd

264
00:27:25.12 --> 00:27:31.76
make the biggest mistake of her life. And then began to walk down that path of quote unquote,

265
00:27:31.76 --> 00:27:38.16
detransitioning. And she talks about what that meant and practical terms in her conversations

266
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:42.56
with her parents and friends and family being completely shunned by this group of, you know,

267
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:50.16
people who are pushing this, this trans and gender ideology. Now, now people who celebrated her one

268
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:54.40
day, and the very next day, once she was like, no, I've made the biggest mistake of my life,

269
00:27:54.40 --> 00:28:00.16
completely shunning her calling her names, giving her death threats online, doctors who had cared

270
00:28:00.16 --> 00:28:05.28
for her one day the next day, once she had made this decision, not returning phone calls or telling

271
00:28:05.28 --> 00:28:12.000
her like, you know, she's still having serious medical issues based on the the mastectomy she had,

272
00:28:12.80 --> 00:28:17.12
that she can't figure out what to do with the doctors like, oh, just put some Vaseline on there.

273
00:28:18.08 --> 00:28:23.52
And, and ultimately, these doctors are not providing her with the kind of care that she needs or

274
00:28:23.52 --> 00:28:30.96
being responsive at all. So she she's actually filed a lawsuit against these doctors and Kaiser that

275
00:28:32.16 --> 00:28:38.16
she dealt with along the way, which is so brave of her to do. She's so incredibly courageous to be

276
00:28:38.16 --> 00:28:42.000
doing what she's doing and speaking out and actively encouraging others to do the same so that people

277
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.32
are able to be better informed. But that that social contagion that she talks really clearly about

278
00:28:50.32 --> 00:28:57.28
of the algorithms having such a heavy influence on her as a young girl, to ultimately bring her to

279
00:28:57.28 --> 00:29:08.56
make this decision, along with other other things as well. But the lack of, I guess, I guess this

280
00:29:08.56 --> 00:29:14.40
phenomenon in our society right now, where there's no open conversation about this that she could

281
00:29:14.40 --> 00:29:20.000
turn to that her family could turn to to say to get a differing perspective or differing view

282
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.64
to where doctors feel afraid to say anything about it. I talked to a friend of mine who's an ER

283
00:29:24.64 --> 00:29:31.12
doc actually in California. And he said, Tulsi, I would say this off the record, but there are a

284
00:29:31.12 --> 00:29:39.28
lot of kids who are coming into the ER who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or deep depression

285
00:29:39.28 --> 00:29:46.96
or other medical issues because of this transition of people who are similarly like Chloe Cole

286
00:29:46.96 --> 00:29:52.24
regretting these decisions that they've made as kids. And but nobody's talking about it.

287
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:56.96
You know, even from from the very top of of, you know, where he works, it was just like all of a

288
00:29:56.96 --> 00:30:05.04
sudden, okay, hey, guys, we're doing this now. And by the way, it's a very profitable venture

289
00:30:05.68 --> 00:30:09.76
knowing that not only the initial treatments, but you're basically once once somebody comes and

290
00:30:09.76 --> 00:30:14.88
tells you they want to do this, you're talking about years of follow on care and drugs and all

291
00:30:14.88 --> 00:30:21.12
and so on and so forth. But there was no conversation about this at all, because it's not allowed.

292
00:30:21.76 --> 00:30:25.92
If you even raise a question and say, Hey, is this really the best thing? Like, are kids really

293
00:30:25.92 --> 00:30:30.32
equipped to make this decision when they're 11 or 12 years old? You're immediately labeled a

294
00:30:30.32 --> 00:30:36.48
transphobe. And how dare you not care for your kids. In that podcast episode that I put out,

295
00:30:36.48 --> 00:30:41.52
there are actual videos from Boston Children's Hospital as one example of unfortunately, many

296
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:45.68
where they're literally saying as soon as your child is capable of expressing themselves,

297
00:30:46.56 --> 00:30:53.84
you'll see signs of them, you know, deciding what their gender identity is, like before they can

298
00:30:53.84 --> 00:30:59.28
even use words and speak any kind of language that you look at like gestures and you look at all

299
00:30:59.28 --> 00:31:05.04
these different things. And you just you see how dangerous this is when critical thinking is like,

300
00:31:05.76 --> 00:31:11.28
it's discouraged. Asking questions is discouraged having differing points of view

301
00:31:11.28 --> 00:31:16.72
is discouraged. And I think even using the word discouraged is putting it lightly. People get

302
00:31:16.72 --> 00:31:22.48
banned on social media, get their accounts, you know, suspended indefinitely for

303
00:31:23.60 --> 00:31:29.68
asking questions or saying, Hey, this is not appropriate for kids. Again, then you add on the

304
00:31:29.68 --> 00:31:36.48
layer of government. And this is where things get so dangerous is that, you know, Chloe mentions

305
00:31:36.48 --> 00:31:43.04
that she knows people personally who parents who've had their kids taken away from them,

306
00:31:43.60 --> 00:31:51.60
simply because they refuse to call them by a name or pronoun different than the one they were given

307
00:31:51.60 --> 00:32:00.40
at birth by child protective services by the government. And this is this is the very real

308
00:32:00.40 --> 00:32:11.36
consequence of people just being willing to go along. And maybe it's like, I don't know,

309
00:32:11.36 --> 00:32:14.96
this doesn't seem right, but at least it's not happening to me or my kids or my family. So I'm

310
00:32:14.96 --> 00:32:21.36
just going to put my head in the, you know, in the sand and not pay attention. But there's,

311
00:32:21.36 --> 00:32:25.44
there's so many different factors you start looking at. I mentioned parents going and,

312
00:32:25.44 --> 00:32:31.28
you know, protesting like, no, you know what, I don't want my seven year old kid being given books

313
00:32:31.28 --> 00:32:36.72
to read at school about like, well, tell me what your sexuality is or tell me what your gender

314
00:32:36.72 --> 00:32:41.76
identity is. I didn't, you know, I heard parents talk about this stuff and I thought, gosh, you

315
00:32:41.76 --> 00:32:46.08
know, this is really concerning. And then I met with with a bunch of parents in Virginia who've

316
00:32:46.08 --> 00:32:51.36
been on the group called parents defending education have been kind of on the front lines of this

317
00:32:51.36 --> 00:32:56.72
fight nationally. And they brought a stack of books and showed me and there was one in particular

318
00:32:57.36 --> 00:33:07.68
that it, it was a graphic novel for middle schoolers. And I had never seen such sexually

319
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:14.40
graphic images ever in my life. And this is something that's being given to kids to help them,

320
00:33:14.40 --> 00:33:22.56
you know, figure out, you know, what their sexuality is. And it's, it's really disturbing

321
00:33:22.56 --> 00:33:30.40
that we live in a society today where this open marketplace of ideas is not allowed to occur.

322
00:33:31.20 --> 00:33:36.88
And it's not allowed to occur because we have people in power who are using the lovers of

323
00:33:36.88 --> 00:33:48.80
government, working with people in the media and in big tech to control speech and to influence

324
00:33:49.84 --> 00:33:59.36
our society. So when I was a kid, let's say you are going to get crazy and really rebel,

325
00:34:00.24 --> 00:34:05.12
you'd grow your hair out, right? And wear a jean jacket or whatever, you know what I mean? Like,

326
00:34:05.12 --> 00:34:09.28
you're listening to Metallica and you're going to go through your Metallica phase and back then

327
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:13.60
Metallica was not the same Metallica that it is now. I mean, back then Metallica was kind of

328
00:34:14.16 --> 00:34:18.56
fringe radical, right? And so you were going to grow your hair out and you were making all

329
00:34:18.56 --> 00:34:25.36
kinds of dumb decisions. I mean, let's face it, when you're that young, you're making just bad

330
00:34:25.36 --> 00:34:30.72
decisions left and right. And so thankfully, your decisions aren't permanent. When, when,

331
00:34:30.72 --> 00:34:36.32
when I was a kid, our decisions weren't permanent. Maybe, maybe you get some tattoos that you're

332
00:34:36.32 --> 00:34:39.76
going to want to wear, you know, a shirt or something when you get older, you're hopefully

333
00:34:39.76 --> 00:34:44.64
didn't jump straight into the neck tattoos or again, Overton window on face tattoos and neck

334
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:49.76
tattoos. I mean, they're, they're becoming more and more mainstream right now. But back in the day,

335
00:34:49.76 --> 00:34:54.64
you weren't going to be doing that kind of thing when you were certainly not 11, 12, 13.

336
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:00.64
And then you think about the Norwood, your parents let you. Yeah, well, there's another piece of

337
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:10.40
this. Like at some point saying shut up to people became bad, right? When I was a kid, you tell

338
00:35:10.40 --> 00:35:13.76
people that your parents would tell you to shut up, your teacher would tell you to shut up,

339
00:35:13.76 --> 00:35:16.56
you would tell your friends to shut up when you were doing something, if you were saying

340
00:35:16.56 --> 00:35:21.52
something stupid, somebody like, Hey, shut up. And at some point that became like a bad word.

341
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:26.32
Do your kids say shut up, Echo Charles? Not to me specifically, but yeah, they say that.

342
00:35:26.32 --> 00:35:31.20
Okay. But if they said it to you, be offensive. There'd be consequences. Which I agree with.

343
00:35:31.20 --> 00:35:35.44
I agree with, you know, you don't want to expect a kid, but would you tell your kids to shut up?

344
00:35:36.80 --> 00:35:43.12
I can't remember, but I'm not against the word shut up at all. Okay. I probably don't say shut

345
00:35:43.12 --> 00:35:49.04
up enough. And I don't think America does right now. Because sometimes, you know, when I was a

346
00:35:49.04 --> 00:35:55.20
kid, it's like, I'd have some stupid idea. I might have shut up. Like, okay, you got to stop sometimes.

347
00:35:55.20 --> 00:36:00.88
When we realize how multiple these kids are, and gullible they are, I mean, this is when, when you

348
00:36:00.88 --> 00:36:05.44
see like the interviews or read interviews, I got a book I haven't done on the podcast yet, but

349
00:36:05.44 --> 00:36:11.28
it's Nazis. Yeah. The young Nazi kids, they were 100%. They didn't know anything else. They didn't

350
00:36:11.28 --> 00:36:16.64
know anything else, at least a lot of them. And same thing with the Kamikaze pilots that are

351
00:36:16.64 --> 00:36:22.08
19 years old. They didn't know anything else. And sure there's, I shouldn't, I want to group

352
00:36:22.08 --> 00:36:26.32
them all together because some of them definitely were like, Hey, wait a second, I'm not so sure

353
00:36:26.32 --> 00:36:32.48
about this. But then they got in those planes and drove them into our, our vessels, our ships,

354
00:36:33.52 --> 00:36:40.40
because they were just totally brainwashed, totally brainwashed. And we, that's how moldable

355
00:36:40.40 --> 00:36:46.64
kids are. And so when you take a freaking 11 year old girl, and you start down this path,

356
00:36:47.12 --> 00:36:50.88
and that's all she's hearing. And that's all the support you're getting. Because look, being a

357
00:36:50.88 --> 00:36:57.36
kid, you know, when I wrote my, when I wrote my first kids book, one of the things I had to put

358
00:36:57.36 --> 00:37:02.48
in perspective was that, you know, I was still in, when I was in the military, my kids were growing

359
00:37:02.48 --> 00:37:07.60
up. Part of my mind would be like, what are these kids talking about? Like nothing matters. This is

360
00:37:07.60 --> 00:37:15.12
Oh, you know, you know, Billy called me, whatever called me a jerk. And I'm like, so what? Right?

361
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:21.28
I'm like, Hey, I'm going to Iraq. What are you kidding me? I got buddies at five face down in

362
00:37:21.28 --> 00:37:24.64
the mud so you could be called a jerk by your friend is freedom of speech. You know what I mean?

363
00:37:24.64 --> 00:37:29.84
Like that's how detached you get. You forget that when you're a kid, that's your whole world.

364
00:37:29.84 --> 00:37:36.64
Yeah. School is your whole world. The bully is your whole world. And, and so what happens

365
00:37:37.20 --> 00:37:43.60
when these kids get a world put around them, that only has one point of view and it's pushing in

366
00:37:43.60 --> 00:37:51.44
one direction, it's no surprise at all that they end up believing what they're hearing from everybody

367
00:37:51.44 --> 00:38:00.32
and everyone's so supportive. And that affirmation and the, I mean, it has, and there's no mistake

368
00:38:00.32 --> 00:38:07.52
for the radical increase in numbers of, of young kids who are now saying, well, you know, I'm trans

369
00:38:07.52 --> 00:38:15.36
or I'm, you know, anywhere on the spectrum of the LGBTQ stuff. It's not like been inching, like

370
00:38:15.36 --> 00:38:20.48
that it's like by hundreds of percent increasing to the point where, and I've talked with teachers

371
00:38:20.48 --> 00:38:25.60
who say like, yeah, of all the kids in my class, there's maybe two who don't consider themselves

372
00:38:25.60 --> 00:38:33.28
LGBTQ something. And so it's kind of become like an Abigail Shrier writes about this and her books

373
00:38:33.28 --> 00:38:39.60
about how kids are being influenced by this. You know, it's peer pressure. It's what's like,

374
00:38:39.60 --> 00:38:44.64
are you cool? Are you boring or all this other stuff? And I'm over here like, bring back Metallico.

375
00:38:46.32 --> 00:38:50.88
Let's bang heads and grow on there. That seems like a lot safer of a thing. You know, the other

376
00:38:50.88 --> 00:38:58.72
piece that you mentioned that is really disturbing. So you can't ask questions about this. So I, you

377
00:38:58.72 --> 00:39:01.68
know, I obviously work with a lot of companies talk about leadership. And one of the things I

378
00:39:01.68 --> 00:39:06.16
talk about when it comes to leadership is I should, if you've got, if you're working, if Tulsi, if

379
00:39:06.16 --> 00:39:12.48
you're working for me and I present a plan and you ask questions, I should be totally open to

380
00:39:12.48 --> 00:39:18.000
answering your questions. Your questions, hopefully are challenging to me and they make me really

381
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.84
think through my idea and they pressure test my idea and I'm happy to answer them. And the minute I

382
00:39:23.84 --> 00:39:29.04
say, shut up Tulsi, I don't hear more questions, just do what I say. I just lost the argument. I

383
00:39:29.04 --> 00:39:35.20
just lost leadership capital because it means I couldn't actually articulate why we're going to do

384
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:40.08
something a certain way. And it also means that I couldn't open my mind enough to say, Tulsi's got

385
00:39:40.08 --> 00:39:44.48
a good point. I should incorporate that into the plan or maybe adjust my plan or maybe abandon my

386
00:39:44.48 --> 00:39:49.68
plan because Tulsi has a really good thought process about this that I didn't think of. But

387
00:39:49.68 --> 00:39:55.12
the minute I say, you know what, just be quiet, no more questions, you do what I say. Exactly.

388
00:39:55.12 --> 00:40:01.84
That means there's something wrong. It exposes your weakness. Right. So if you have a question

389
00:40:01.84 --> 00:40:09.52
for me and my answer is you're transphobic, that's not a great answer. No. That's not a great answer.

390
00:40:09.52 --> 00:40:14.40
And look, could it be true? Could I be a person that I'm scared of transphobic people? Sure. Well,

391
00:40:14.40 --> 00:40:17.92
let me think through it then. What am I scared of? Okay, let's have a conversation about that.

392
00:40:18.72 --> 00:40:22.08
So, but instead, just to be like, no, I don't want to hear any more of your questions.

393
00:40:22.08 --> 00:40:30.08
This is a problem and it doesn't lead to a situation where we make progress and where we

394
00:40:30.08 --> 00:40:37.20
can actually agree upon anything. That's right. So how's the leadership, the governmental leadership,

395
00:40:37.20 --> 00:40:43.28
when you talk about the governmental leadership, kind of helping push this type of agenda? What

396
00:40:43.28 --> 00:40:51.76
does that look like? Well, it's exactly what you're talking about. The choice to ridicule, discredit,

397
00:40:51.76 --> 00:40:59.92
smear, and censor through partners in Big Tech, Google, Facebook, all of that, rather than actually

398
00:41:00.96 --> 00:41:11.04
have a conversation based on substance that's having this fear, this self-censoring effect

399
00:41:11.04 --> 00:41:15.76
on people where they're too afraid to even ask questions. They're too afraid to state their

400
00:41:15.76 --> 00:41:23.68
own views or opinions or even their own experiences on this. Have you had Kristen Beck on your podcast?

401
00:41:23.68 --> 00:41:31.04
I have not. I think I heard her talking on Rogan, but Kristen Beck has had similar experiences,

402
00:41:31.04 --> 00:41:37.28
even as a trans adult person saying, well, I don't know, like, this is really dangerous for kids.

403
00:41:37.28 --> 00:41:42.56
Like, this is a decision. If people want to make this decision as adults, this is a free country

404
00:41:42.56 --> 00:41:47.84
and you have the freedom to do that and live with whatever the outcomes of that decision may be.

405
00:41:48.40 --> 00:41:53.76
But for this to be happening to kids, and Beck has received extremely negative consequences,

406
00:41:53.76 --> 00:41:57.68
both on social media and in society, because of stating that fact,

407
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:08.64
the government is pushing this under the guise of something they call gender affirming care,

408
00:42:08.64 --> 00:42:13.36
which sounds like something everyone should be for, right? We want to care for and respect each

409
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:24.88
other just as people, but what they're doing is actually abuse of kids. Chloe Cole's story is not

410
00:42:25.52 --> 00:42:34.56
a rare case. There are many others, both documented, but also those that haven't been reported of kids

411
00:42:34.56 --> 00:42:38.24
who have gone through or going through exactly what she's been through. She started in Oregon,

412
00:42:38.24 --> 00:42:42.88
started an organization to be able to reach out to and help provide support to other kids who've

413
00:42:42.88 --> 00:42:52.08
gone through the path that she has walked down. The government factor is they're saying that if

414
00:42:52.08 --> 00:42:59.68
you as parents don't provide gender affirming care, then child protective services may come in and

415
00:42:59.68 --> 00:43:09.04
intervene in order to ensure that your child receives that care elsewhere. They are using this

416
00:43:09.60 --> 00:43:16.16
gender affirming care when it comes to federal funding. So for schools, for example, who the

417
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:21.52
government says refuse to provide this quote unquote gender affirming care, which may come in the

418
00:43:21.52 --> 00:43:32.32
form of like, okay, not allowing boys to go into the girls locker room, boys who say, well, you

419
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:40.80
know, I identify as a girl. If a publicly funded school does not allow that to happen, the federal

420
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:47.12
government says, okay, we are not going to provide you with federal funding for what they call free

421
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:54.56
and reduced lunch for kids who are at a certain low level in the poverty scale, get free and

422
00:43:54.56 --> 00:43:59.76
reduced lunch at schools. The government says if your school does not provide this gender affirming

423
00:43:59.76 --> 00:44:04.08
care by allowing boys to go into the girls locker room, boys who say they're a girl,

424
00:44:04.80 --> 00:44:10.72
then we're going to take that money away from you. Who hurts? Who's harmed in that scenario,

425
00:44:10.72 --> 00:44:15.92
which is actually happening. It's kids who are hungry who can't afford to buy their own lunch

426
00:44:15.92 --> 00:44:21.52
at school. And so, I mean, there's so many examples of this where their hypocrisy is just playing out

427
00:44:21.52 --> 00:44:27.68
literally in real time. Their hypocrisy of saying, well, hey, this year, 2022 is the 50th anniversary

428
00:44:27.68 --> 00:44:35.68
of the enactment of Title IX. The law that was put in place literally out of a recognition of the

429
00:44:35.68 --> 00:44:41.04
biological difference between the male and female sex and to make sure that there was a level playing

430
00:44:41.04 --> 00:44:48.32
field because kids like your daughter back in the day, they didn't have the opportunity to get on a

431
00:44:48.32 --> 00:44:53.28
girl's wrestling team because they didn't exist in schools and with most sports. It was like,

432
00:44:53.28 --> 00:44:57.36
okay, well, there's boy sports and there's girls cheerleading. That was kind of, you know, or like

433
00:44:57.36 --> 00:45:02.88
my mom, she had water ballet and my mom's pretty athletic, but her options were pretty limited

434
00:45:02.88 --> 00:45:10.24
as a kid growing up in East Grand Rapids in Michigan. So, Title IX 50 years later has created

435
00:45:10.24 --> 00:45:15.12
huge opportunities for girls and women in sports, which then leaves opportunities in different

436
00:45:15.12 --> 00:45:21.68
professions and so on in their life. On this anniversary, 50th anniversary of Title IX, now

437
00:45:21.68 --> 00:45:28.08
the government in this administration is trying to, or they are actually redefining Title IX in

438
00:45:28.08 --> 00:45:34.48
the law, not by passing an amendment through Congress, but instead back during it through a

439
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:40.72
rule change to now include this gender identity, which basically says like anybody who says they

440
00:45:40.72 --> 00:45:49.12
are a woman can be a woman at any given point in time and therefore by doing so, erasing,

441
00:45:50.96 --> 00:45:58.80
doing two things, erasing women as a group in society because now you could, if you, if you

442
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:03.44
wake up tomorrow, you're like, yeah, I'm a woman. All right. Well, the government says now you are,

443
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:10.24
you are, you are the same protected class as a biological woman as, as me. Um, but, but the

444
00:46:10.24 --> 00:46:15.84
deeper kind of underlying danger goes back to where we started is this change is our government

445
00:46:15.84 --> 00:46:21.36
saying there is no such thing as objective truth. There is no such thing as biology. There is no

446
00:46:21.36 --> 00:46:27.52
such thing as this biological difference between a male and female. And if we, as a society, except

447
00:46:27.52 --> 00:46:34.16
this premise, then where are the boundaries? There, there literally are no boundaries. And

448
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:40.40
where does this lead? I mean, I've talked about this before. You would think that kids are the

449
00:46:40.40 --> 00:46:45.68
one place where everyone in our society can agree. Like we have to, kids are the most vulnerable.

450
00:46:46.24 --> 00:46:51.84
We have to protect our kids. Well, now there, it has, it is starting to become acceptable

451
00:46:51.84 --> 00:46:59.60
to use this term minor attracted person, which is a pedophile. It's a pedophile. And yet you have

452
00:46:59.60 --> 00:47:04.48
teachers. That's the overton window expanding. Exactly. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about.

453
00:47:04.48 --> 00:47:08.16
And so people are like, Oh yeah, you know, we should just like let people be, they want to be in

454
00:47:08.16 --> 00:47:14.72
kids and this and that. Like, okay, so if you deny that shut up comes in, right? You should be like,

455
00:47:14.72 --> 00:47:19.52
Hey, no, shut up. You're not allowed to say that. Sure. We're there. Yeah, exactly. Seriously. And

456
00:47:19.52 --> 00:47:26.72
then you have people who are teachers in a position to care for our kids on social media. Like, yeah,

457
00:47:26.72 --> 00:47:31.60
I'm a minor attracted person. And this is how I feel when I'm standing in front of the classroom

458
00:47:31.60 --> 00:47:37.60
and using this very sexually explicit language. And parents are giving their children over to

459
00:47:37.60 --> 00:47:43.12
these people for, for more hours, waking hours of the day, probably then they spend time,

460
00:47:43.12 --> 00:47:49.36
they're able to spend time with their kids. And if you're, you become a bigot, if you're like,

461
00:47:49.36 --> 00:47:56.24
uh, yeah, no, this is not okay. This normalization of pedophilia is exactly what's happening right now.

462
00:47:56.24 --> 00:48:02.32
How does it happen? Where does it start going back to restart? Like, well, you look at each,

463
00:48:02.32 --> 00:48:07.28
you know, how this overton window is opening and pushing you not just to respect someone's

464
00:48:07.28 --> 00:48:14.88
different choices, but to openly accept and champion these things that are literally insane

465
00:48:14.88 --> 00:48:22.64
and are causing direct harm to our kids. And, and again, this is where the societal shift

466
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.000
and change, this cancel culture, this, this fear mongering, pushing self-censorship coupled with

467
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.20
the power of government, both directly and indirectly through big tech is, is, has put us in a very

468
00:48:35.20 --> 00:48:44.32
dangerous place in our society. How much did you see with big tech, uh, collusion with the government?

469
00:48:44.32 --> 00:48:51.92
When you were in the government? Um, quite a bit, especially when I ran for president.

470
00:48:53.44 --> 00:49:01.92
I, um, you know, I, I don't know, I could probably think of a number of reasons why it, uh,

471
00:49:03.36 --> 00:49:09.44
it escalated so quickly there where, you know, it got to a point where even as I was, you know,

472
00:49:09.44 --> 00:49:14.24
being very outspoken on different issues beforehand, I think certain powers that be maybe

473
00:49:14.24 --> 00:49:18.08
didn't think that, oh, well, you know, she's just saying her piece. She's over here on the sidelines,

474
00:49:18.08 --> 00:49:25.44
but, you know, running for president provides a certain platform. And, um, and it was, I mean,

475
00:49:25.44 --> 00:49:31.52
the, the first kind of eye-opening experience to me was when, uh, we had the very first presidential

476
00:49:31.52 --> 00:49:37.92
debate in the Democratic primaries. It was in 2019. Uh, you know, most people in the country

477
00:49:37.92 --> 00:49:42.56
didn't know who I was and never heard of me before. And my hope was, all right, cool. There'll be

478
00:49:42.56 --> 00:49:46.32
millions of people watching. And I think there were north of 20 million people who tuned into

479
00:49:46.32 --> 00:49:53.60
that first debate, maybe a little off, but ballpark. And, um, my hope is I'll be able to introduce

480
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:57.84
myself, let people know why I'm offering to serve as president and commander in chief. And then,

481
00:49:57.84 --> 00:50:02.48
you know, they'll go online and say, okay, cool. I want to learn more. We set up all of our Google

482
00:50:02.48 --> 00:50:06.88
AdSense accounts in the hopes that they would do so and that I would be able to have my,

483
00:50:06.88 --> 00:50:15.60
my website there, uh, ahead of whatever stuff Google chose to push on people. I was the most

484
00:50:15.60 --> 00:50:20.32
searched candidate of the night after that debate, which we had hoped would be the case.

485
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:27.04
And, uh, all of a sudden our, our Google ad account was suspended with no explanation,

486
00:50:27.04 --> 00:50:32.56
no notice, no message, like literally nothing, just crickets. And so our team immediately

487
00:50:32.56 --> 00:50:36.56
obviously started to reach out like, Hey, what's going on here? We set this up according to all

488
00:50:36.56 --> 00:50:41.68
the rules and da da da. We tested it beforehand. Everything was good. What happened? No response.

489
00:50:42.48 --> 00:50:48.000
And this went on for a period of time. And then all of a sudden we, we, we still never got a

490
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.32
response. Then all of a sudden the account was, was, uh, the suspension was taken off the account.

491
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:57.04
And that was the first like glaring example directly that I felt.

492
00:50:58.64 --> 00:51:02.56
What part of your mind was like, Oh dang, that, that's too bad. I can't believe this weird thing

493
00:51:02.56 --> 00:51:07.68
happened. And what part of your mind was like these bastards, these bastards, I went straight there,

494
00:51:07.68 --> 00:51:13.36
I went straight there because it was, it was, were you suspect already going into it? Did you,

495
00:51:13.36 --> 00:51:20.000
or is that just like a total eye opener? No, I mean, I had, you know, the, the, um, influence and

496
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.28
impact of these big tech companies and social media was already pretty clear, you know, how

497
00:51:25.28 --> 00:51:30.40
their algorithms were trying to push certain kinds of information to invoke a certain response

498
00:51:30.40 --> 00:51:34.96
from their, from their users. I think things were becoming more and more clear just broadly at that

499
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:43.28
point, uh, which is why when that happened, uh, it was way too much of a coincidence to just be a

500
00:51:43.28 --> 00:51:50.40
coincidence. Um, I, I ultimately filed a lawsuit against Google because of this to, to make the

501
00:51:50.40 --> 00:51:55.84
point and to make the statement that they shouldn't be allowed to get away with this. People need to

502
00:51:55.84 --> 00:52:03.76
know how much power a monopoly like Google has on directly influencing interfering in our

503
00:52:03.76 --> 00:52:08.48
elections. And that, that if they can do this to a sitting member of Congress running for the

504
00:52:08.48 --> 00:52:15.60
highest office in the land, making it so that they are manipulating and, and dictating what

505
00:52:15.60 --> 00:52:21.68
information people see when they type in, who is Tulsi Gabbard, they can do it to anyone for any reason.

506
00:52:21.68 --> 00:52:28.72
Uh, you know, whether you're running for mayor or dog catcher or whatever it might be,

507
00:52:29.76 --> 00:52:39.28
that this private corporation gets to determine what we as voters know and see and hear about a

508
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:45.68
person. And that, that became increasingly clear throughout my entire campaign, how, um, you know,

509
00:52:45.68 --> 00:52:51.84
the, the power elite, as I call them, or the permanent Washington, that these are made up of

510
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:55.36
some of the most powerful people in politics, the most powerful people in corporate media and the

511
00:52:55.36 --> 00:53:02.08
most powerful people in big tech are interfering in our elections by dictating who voters are

512
00:53:02.08 --> 00:53:06.72
exposed to and what they are exposed to about certain people who are, are running for office.

513
00:53:06.72 --> 00:53:14.08
They decide what, what the narrative, what the narrative is. And so to say, and this is, this

514
00:53:14.08 --> 00:53:18.000
is the thing, of course, they don't talk about when they talk about, you know, influence and

515
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.28
interference in our democracy and our elections, but it is the biggest and most impactful thing

516
00:53:23.28 --> 00:53:30.24
that is influencing voters. Um, and, and there've been recent cases that have come forward about

517
00:53:30.24 --> 00:53:34.40
Google, for example, like in just in this past election, there was a report that was done

518
00:53:35.76 --> 00:53:41.12
showing that, you know, political emails from candidates going into Gmail accounts, which

519
00:53:41.12 --> 00:53:48.56
most people have favored sending these, uh, favored, uh, progressive or Democrat candidates

520
00:53:48.56 --> 00:53:56.24
or Democrat messaging to, to funnel those emails into your inbox. Whereas, uh, conservative or

521
00:53:56.24 --> 00:54:06.32
Republican political emails were more than 50% of the time end up in your spam box. So, you know,

522
00:54:06.32 --> 00:54:12.08
there, there are a lot of different examples of this, but it's a dangerous, dangerous thing.

523
00:54:13.92 --> 00:54:19.60
That is now going unchecked. There's no check and balance on that. And then you look at, well,

524
00:54:19.60 --> 00:54:24.40
okay, well, so what are the political leanings of these big tech companies and Facebook has,

525
00:54:24.40 --> 00:54:29.44
has obviously they've been in the news a lot about this as well. You know, they, they, they

526
00:54:29.44 --> 00:54:37.20
have a specific political slant, but to me, whether the political slant is to the left or to the right,

527
00:54:37.20 --> 00:54:43.60
or if it's Democrat versus Republican, if, if we don't number one, if we're not informed about it,

528
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:49.20
not calling it out and not pushing our lawmakers to say, Hey, you know, this is this, we have to

529
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:55.12
call it for what it is. They're directly trying to influence, um, influence our elections. We have

530
00:54:55.12 --> 00:55:00.32
to be willing to do it whoever is, you know, whatever their political slant is. The point is

531
00:55:00.32 --> 00:55:04.48
like freedom of speech is freedom of speech. We have to be willing to protect that freedom of

532
00:55:04.48 --> 00:55:10.64
speech, no matter, um, whether we like it or not, or whether we agree with that, that speech or not.

533
00:55:11.36 --> 00:55:16.88
I guess the live experiments going on right now with, with Twitter, right? With Elon. Yes.

534
00:55:16.88 --> 00:55:23.12
And what he's doing and he's bringing back all these people that were banned, including Donald

535
00:55:23.12 --> 00:55:27.76
Trump, he just brought back Donald Trump. I don't think Donald Trump has gone on and gone back to

536
00:55:27.76 --> 00:55:35.60
Twitter yet. And apparently he has some kind of commitment to the other, to the truth, which is

537
00:55:35.60 --> 00:55:43.68
another social media platform, truth, media, truth, truth, truth, social. Yeah. So, but Elon's

538
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:49.76
let everybody on, except for Alex Jones, Alex Jones, he did not let our echo, you're laughing at

539
00:55:49.76 --> 00:55:58.24
that. Finally got to react that echo. Yeah. Nay, Alex Jones. Yes, that's funny to me, but I don't

540
00:55:58.24 --> 00:56:04.000
know. Okay. He's going through a lot of legal, legal situations right now. Yeah. What is he,

541
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
he's owes billions of dollars currently, right? Billions of dollars to the parents of the Sandy

542
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.76
Hook massacre. Uh, but so other than Alex Jones, it looks like, it looks like Elon and Twitter is

543
00:56:17.76 --> 00:56:22.48
just going wide open. Yeah. I think it's literally other than Alex Jones. What's interesting to me

544
00:56:22.48 --> 00:56:29.76
about that is the people who are publicizing that they're leaving because now, you know, as Elon

545
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:34.88
said, he's a free speech absolutist. Which can you say that if you don't bring Alex Jones back on?

546
00:56:34.88 --> 00:56:38.72
I don't know. Can you? Is that, is that an absolutist? Technically, that's not absolute.

547
00:56:38.72 --> 00:56:46.16
Okay. So he's almost an absolute. I saw the other day that CBS news,

548
00:56:46.16 --> 00:56:51.20
what is it? They, they like, oh, we're leaving Twitter. And then I, was it like a day or two?

549
00:56:51.20 --> 00:56:56.08
And then they came back. They came back. You know, Fox news left Twitter for a long time.

550
00:56:56.08 --> 00:57:00.32
Is that right? They left, they left Twitter for, for months and months and months,

551
00:57:00.32 --> 00:57:04.56
they left Twitter and they stayed off. And I forget what brought them back on, but,

552
00:57:05.20 --> 00:57:10.24
but you, so you have this experiment kind of with Elon Musk right now, opening up Twitter.

553
00:57:10.24 --> 00:57:16.72
And I guess we'll see what happens. And I mean, the whole thing, it's just such drama. And that's

554
00:57:16.72 --> 00:57:21.52
one thing that's interesting. You know, I always feel like all this stuff that we're talking about

555
00:57:21.52 --> 00:57:28.56
is like a separate world that I'm actually not that, I don't get fully engaged in that world

556
00:57:28.56 --> 00:57:34.32
because I actually have a bunch of businesses and like things going on. And I feel like that's

557
00:57:34.32 --> 00:57:39.36
more normal. And if you're not careful, you think that this world that we're talking about,

558
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:44.24
the world of social media, the world of Twitter, the world of Facebook, the world of Instagram,

559
00:57:44.24 --> 00:57:48.80
if you're not careful, you think that's real. And you have to remember that it's not real.

560
00:57:48.80 --> 00:57:54.16
And that it's just a, it's just a virtual world that's not real, but there's people that live

561
00:57:54.16 --> 00:57:58.80
and die in that world. And they, and that world drives them crazy. By the way, I got asked that,

562
00:57:59.84 --> 00:58:05.04
I got asked that on a podcast interview a little while ago, you know, well, how do you feel when

563
00:58:05.04 --> 00:58:11.12
people make bad comments about you on Twitter or on, and I said, Hey, I recommend you don't really

564
00:58:11.12 --> 00:58:16.56
get concerned about those things because it's a bot. It's a bot or it's a person that's just

565
00:58:16.56 --> 00:58:20.96
looking, it's a troll or a bot. That's pretty much what you're, how many, what percentage of

566
00:58:20.96 --> 00:58:25.28
negative comments are coming from a person that is making a negative comment because their goal

567
00:58:25.28 --> 00:58:29.84
is to help influence you and move you in a better direction and see their perspective. The chances

568
00:58:29.84 --> 00:58:35.28
is very few. It's a bot or it's a troll. So how are you getting spun up about this stuff? I was in

569
00:58:35.28 --> 00:58:40.56
Greensboro, North Carolina a few days ago, stopped in a little shop on the side of the road. And

570
00:58:41.36 --> 00:58:50.08
this guy comes up to me and he's like, Oh my God, are you Tulsi freaking Gabbard? It's like, Yeah.

571
00:58:50.08 --> 00:58:54.64
It's like, what are you doing here? There's nothing in Greensboro. It's like, Oh, you know,

572
00:58:54.64 --> 00:58:58.000
I'm here for this event. I'll be speaking at later on. And he's like, you know what,

573
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.000
if I was on Twitter right now, I would be putting out a tweet saying how much I don't like Tulsi

574
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.36
Gabbard, but now you're standing right in front of him and I can't freaking say that. Like, you're

575
00:59:09.36 --> 00:59:14.000
a real person. And you know, I ended up talking to him for about five minutes or so. And he's like,

576
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.32
I got to take a picture. I was like, all right, if you posted on Twitter, you better like be

577
00:59:18.32 --> 00:59:22.56
true to your word here, buddy, and not, not start talking shit about me. But it was just funny,

578
00:59:22.56 --> 00:59:30.000
the interaction, which is exactly that. Like in real life, very rarely, I've actually had it

579
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.36
happen a couple of times where people will come up and say the kinds of harsh, you know,

580
00:59:33.36 --> 00:59:38.48
mean criticisms that they say on Twitter, maybe all the time. But by and large, most people,

581
00:59:39.60 --> 00:59:42.64
they wouldn't have that kind of interaction with someone in real life.

582
00:59:43.44 --> 00:59:48.88
What was the guy's beef with you? Or what do you suspect? I don't know, you know, it was interesting

583
00:59:48.88 --> 00:59:52.56
because he was, because after he said that, he's like, all right, can I just ask you one question?

584
00:59:52.56 --> 00:59:55.36
I was like, yeah, like my ride's waiting outside. I don't have a lot of time, but

585
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.60
he's like, you know, you, you say a lot of things that are pretty critical to democratic party. And

586
01:00:01.60 --> 01:00:05.52
I agree with a lot of those things, but why are you still a Democrat? I'm like, Oh, I'm not.

587
01:00:05.52 --> 01:00:12.08
He's like, Oh, you're not. It's like, no, go listen to episode one of my podcast. And there's 29

588
01:00:12.08 --> 01:00:18.32
minutes of me telling you exactly why I left the Democrat party. But then that was it. And then he's

589
01:00:18.32 --> 01:00:22.64
like, Oh my gosh, like, okay, I'm going to go and listen to that. But, and then he asked if he

590
01:00:22.64 --> 01:00:25.76
could take a picture. And then as I was walking out, there were people sitting next to him,

591
01:00:25.76 --> 01:00:29.60
was like, is that, is that Tulsi guy? I was like, yeah, anyways, it was just funny.

592
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:37.60
Because I don't know that he knew exactly what his beef was. But for whatever reason,

593
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:45.20
he was not positively disposed towards me. But then after four minutes of a conversation,

594
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:52.40
and just recognizing like, Hey, yeah, I'm a real person. You're a real person. And maybe we don't

595
01:00:52.40 --> 01:00:57.60
agree on everything. Probably don't disagree on some things. Cool. That's fine. But, you know,

596
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:03.68
street each other with respect. Yeah. And what's scary about that is someone that's just like,

597
01:01:03.68 --> 01:01:07.60
I don't, I don't like you. And I have beef with you and files on Twitter. I'd be talking smack.

598
01:01:07.60 --> 01:01:12.000
Yeah. And the main reason is because that you've been labeled as a Democrat. And so they're not

599
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.96
a Democrat. So therefore they must hate you. Right. And that's the horrible thing, right?

600
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:22.16
Because, you know, someone can be anything. And if you have an open mind and listen to what they

601
01:01:22.16 --> 01:01:24.96
have to say, you know, well, they got some good points there. And that really doesn't make any

602
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:29.76
sense to me right now. But let's hear what their perspective is. And that's a good way to,

603
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:37.04
a good way to like, survive and live with other human beings in the world. Yeah. Listen to what

604
01:01:37.04 --> 01:01:42.96
they have to say, maybe try and see their perspective a little bit, which it just seems like is very

605
01:01:42.96 --> 01:01:49.92
limited, especially in the, in the world of social media. Yeah. And this, this goes to, you know,

606
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:55.92
one of the, this is something that I talked about in my statement about why I left the Democrat

607
01:01:55.92 --> 01:02:03.36
party is how divided our country has become largely because of those, those, you know, well,

608
01:02:03.36 --> 01:02:08.72
if you are white, therefore you are this. If you are black, therefore you are that.

609
01:02:09.36 --> 01:02:18.48
And, and how the Democratic party has completely gone against Dr. King's dream of this, you know,

610
01:02:18.48 --> 01:02:21.84
that his kids would one day grow up in a society where we're judged based on our character,

611
01:02:21.84 --> 01:02:27.60
not the color of our skin. Well, now even in our, our schools, elementary schools, they want our

612
01:02:27.60 --> 01:02:33.28
kids to be taught that if you're white, you're privileged. If you are a person of color, then

613
01:02:33.28 --> 01:02:40.88
you are the oppressed or you are the victim and dividing us based on the color of our skin and

614
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:46.32
racializing everything in our society. If something happens, well, obviously it's because of race,

615
01:02:46.32 --> 01:02:52.80
obviously it's because of the color of your skin. And you, you can go down that path of these broad

616
01:02:52.80 --> 01:03:00.48
categorizations, whether it's based on party politics or race, ethnicity, religion,

617
01:03:00.48 --> 01:03:07.68
any of these boxes that, that they like to put us in and use as wedges to drive us apart,

618
01:03:08.24 --> 01:03:12.56
rather than again, focus like, all right, let's just go below the surface and recognize that,

619
01:03:12.56 --> 01:03:22.24
you know, all people from Hawaii are not the same or, you know, whatever the fill in the blank is,

620
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:29.52
we get into dangerous territory when we judge each other just based on, you know, the superficial

621
01:03:29.52 --> 01:03:35.52
or the label that is attached to us. And I've been on the receiving end of this constantly,

622
01:03:35.52 --> 01:03:41.36
because I've never fit into any one of those specific boxes. And, you know, friends of mine

623
01:03:41.36 --> 01:03:45.84
say, well, that, that hurts you politically because then you don't have like that natural support base.

624
01:03:47.12 --> 01:03:52.64
But, you know, none of us as people are, are monoliths, none of us are just walking around as

625
01:03:52.64 --> 01:03:59.76
like, oh, you know, this, these labels are attached to me, therefore I am that and it assuming that

626
01:03:59.76 --> 01:04:06.72
in our society has the negative effect of, of not encouraging that critical thinking, that independent

627
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:13.12
thought, that healthy skepticism of like, all right, when I read this story or I hear this view,

628
01:04:13.92 --> 01:04:17.52
where are they coming from? What's the angle on it? What's, what's, what's their experience?

629
01:04:17.52 --> 01:04:21.92
Maybe that's informed that that may be different from my own. And what can I learn from it?

630
01:04:21.92 --> 01:04:26.32
You know, or what, maybe I end up disagreeing with it. And, but I've thought through here are the

631
01:04:26.32 --> 01:04:31.68
reasons why not just because like, oh, that person is in this category or this group, therefore

632
01:04:32.40 --> 01:04:39.76
I must disagree, I must be opposed. And, and that's a, it has the opposite effect of

633
01:04:41.76 --> 01:04:47.60
I think the foundation of this country, which is we are all Americans out of many, there are one.

634
01:04:47.60 --> 01:04:53.92
And this kind of individual thought and freedom of expression was celebrated at one time in this

635
01:04:53.92 --> 01:05:00.16
country. And now worse than not being celebrated, there are punitive effects and consequences

636
01:05:00.16 --> 01:05:06.000
to that freedom of expression, to where it becomes freedom of expression, you know, for those in power,

637
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.32
freedom of expression is only celebrated if they agree with it.

638
01:05:08.32 --> 01:05:15.28
Imagine the being the adversary of America, like you're China right now, and you're just sitting

639
01:05:15.28 --> 01:05:21.84
there watching this unfold. And there's no better way to destroy your adversary than to have them

640
01:05:21.84 --> 01:05:28.32
destroy themselves. And so it's no, it's no surprise when, you know, the, the, the Russian

641
01:05:28.32 --> 01:05:34.72
bought farms were setting up these, these pro, these counter protests and protests in the same

642
01:05:34.72 --> 01:05:42.40
neighborhoods and, and, and really just doing all they could to divide America. And that's why

643
01:05:42.40 --> 01:05:50.64
where I always try and keep that top of mind for myself when, when I get put into a scenario

644
01:05:50.64 --> 01:05:58.64
where someone's trying to, you know, frame me up mentally, frame me up mentally. I'm always thinking

645
01:05:58.64 --> 01:06:02.80
to myself, okay, well, hold on a second. Don't get me wrong. I'm always thinking to myself,

646
01:06:02.80 --> 01:06:07.12
okay, well, hold on a second. Don't get framed up mentally. Listen to what someone else has to

647
01:06:07.12 --> 01:06:10.72
say. See what their perspective is. And remember that they're American and I'm an American.

648
01:06:10.72 --> 01:06:15.84
Because if I'm an American and you're American, cool, we got all kinds of things in common,

649
01:06:15.84 --> 01:06:21.60
all kinds of things in common. I think I said this on this podcast before, unless you're an actual

650
01:06:21.60 --> 01:06:28.40
ISIS member, I, I, I, we're going to find some common ground. Like we're going to both like

651
01:06:28.40 --> 01:06:33.52
UFC or we're going to both like guitar, like there's going to be something there. Yeah. We're

652
01:06:33.52 --> 01:06:38.24
going to both like Led Zeppelin or whatever. There's going to be something there where we go,

653
01:06:38.24 --> 01:06:42.64
okay, cool. I'm, I'm down. You know, only listen to Led Zeppelin. Cool. What's your favorite album?

654
01:06:42.64 --> 01:06:50.72
Like, let's go. But it's really easy to just focus on, oh, you like this and I don't like that.

655
01:06:50.72 --> 01:06:56.32
Therefore, you're my enemy and we should fight, which is really, really freaking lame. Yeah.

656
01:06:56.32 --> 01:07:01.28
It's really lame. And that's where we get framed up all day. Day long and social media is the

657
01:07:01.28 --> 01:07:06.64
amplifier of that, that we've never seen before. Truly. Never seen before. I think it would clean

658
01:07:06.64 --> 01:07:10.16
up a lot on Twitter if you were only allowed to be you. You're only allowed to have your name.

659
01:07:10.16 --> 01:07:15.76
Yeah. I agree with that. You can hide behind. Isn't that kind of what Facebook does? Facebook

660
01:07:15.76 --> 01:07:22.24
does that, right? Can you be on Facebook and be like, you know, alpha 29474 and make a bunch of

661
01:07:22.24 --> 01:07:28.72
comments? Echo Charles expert. That's not a yes or no question. You kind of can't, you could probably

662
01:07:28.72 --> 01:07:34.96
get away with it to a degree. Yeah. Yeah. False name or yeah. Yeah. Cause I see people with that

663
01:07:34.96 --> 01:07:38.96
on Facebook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With the something other than their real name. Yes.

664
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:43.20
So maybe if you're going to make, which is like the catfishing, right? Like they put up,

665
01:07:43.20 --> 01:07:48.08
they find like pictures of, well, that depends if they're trying to misrepresent their identity.

666
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:53.04
That's true. But to take advantage of someone else. Yeah. You know, that's like an alias,

667
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:58.48
nickname, you know, that kind of, I see that for sure. But I, I don't think Facebook is like

668
01:07:59.36 --> 01:08:04.08
openly permissive about it. I think it's like they try to make you have your real name. It seems

669
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:10.48
like it seems to me when I look at Facebook comments, they're people. Yes. Twitter comments.

670
01:08:10.48 --> 01:08:18.88
Maybe not so much. No, no, no, no, no, no. YouTube fully not. And the divisiveness people.

671
01:08:18.88 --> 01:08:23.76
This is another thing that I find interesting is people talk about it's never been more divisive

672
01:08:23.76 --> 01:08:29.20
than it is now. And I get it. We want to make headlines, but man, we had a literal civil war

673
01:08:29.20 --> 01:08:37.60
where 650,000 people died, 650,000 people died. Right. And even in the late 60s, early 70s,

674
01:08:37.60 --> 01:08:45.52
there was crazy, crazy civil unrest. And there was, you know, the Sibonese liberation army and the

675
01:08:45.52 --> 01:08:51.44
black liberation army and the black Panthers and the weather underground. And these were groups

676
01:08:51.44 --> 01:08:57.84
that were killing. Like there was like something like 35 police officers that were assassinated.

677
01:08:57.84 --> 01:09:03.44
There was bombings. Bombings happened so much in those days that it was, it almost didn't even

678
01:09:03.44 --> 01:09:08.000
make the headline of the news. I mean, if there's a, if someone puts a bomb off today in America,

679
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.56
that's going to be in the front of every news story, every news corporation there is.

680
01:09:13.12 --> 01:09:16.96
Back in the late 60s, early 70s, that stuff was just happening. They were just blowing stuff up.

681
01:09:17.68 --> 01:09:23.36
So it's not as bad. It's not the worst it's ever been. But it certainly seems that way when you

682
01:09:23.36 --> 01:09:30.32
go on social media and you start paying attention to that mayhem. Yeah, it's true. And, you know,

683
01:09:30.32 --> 01:09:36.16
I don't know what the recent numbers, but I feel like Twitter, you might know this echo,

684
01:09:36.16 --> 01:09:44.000
but Twitter, I think is like, compared to the old, you're the tech guy, but it's something like,

685
01:09:45.28 --> 01:09:50.80
like less than 5% of Americans are on Twitter. It's something, it's a really, I was just

686
01:09:50.80 --> 01:09:59.68
surprisingly low number. But you look at, it is known as the place for people in politics and the

687
01:09:59.68 --> 01:10:05.44
media. And so when you look at the outsized influence, you know, like a tweet can make a news story.

688
01:10:07.60 --> 01:10:12.72
It's not representative of, you know, the vast majority of Americans in this country.

689
01:10:13.68 --> 01:10:18.24
But it has an outsized effect. It does have an outsized effect. And I think that is safe to

690
01:10:18.24 --> 01:10:23.36
say it's not the, it's, most people aren't spending, I had this conversation with Ben Shapiro.

691
01:10:23.92 --> 01:10:27.28
You know, he was talking about all this stuff and I said, Hey, Ben, you're at ground zero

692
01:10:27.28 --> 01:10:32.16
for like political controversy in mayhem. And most people in America are just like

693
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:36.64
working their job, going to their kids jiu-jitsu tournament, wrestling tournament,

694
01:10:36.64 --> 01:10:42.32
piano recital. That's what most people are doing. Now, if you want to open up that app and just get,

695
01:10:42.32 --> 01:10:46.000
let it creep into your brain, it's going to get in there for sure. Yeah.

696
01:10:47.20 --> 01:10:51.28
I had to take during, when I was running for president, my husband, like he doesn't like

697
01:10:51.28 --> 01:10:59.36
politics and he's not a guy, he's not a social media guy at all. But he was starting to look at

698
01:10:59.36 --> 01:11:04.08
Twitter a lot. And it got to the point where it was like actually caught like first of all, he's

699
01:11:04.08 --> 01:11:11.76
like, who is this person? Where are they? Where do they live? But, but I remember like we're sitting

700
01:11:11.76 --> 01:11:15.92
in like an Olive Garden for dinner, probably in New Hampshire somewhere. And he was, it was,

701
01:11:15.92 --> 01:11:22.000
he was glued to his phone and I could like almost palpably feel his blood pressure rising. And,

702
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.32
you know, his, his like stress and anxiety and anger and just all of these emotions. And

703
01:11:26.88 --> 01:11:31.12
there was a few times I literally had to physically pull his phone from his hand. And then he

704
01:11:31.12 --> 01:11:36.40
ultimately just deleted the app because, you know, this is not a world that he lives in. I've been

705
01:11:36.40 --> 01:11:46.16
used to all kinds of attacks for a really long time. But it has, yeah, I mean, for, for, you can

706
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:51.76
understand that for people who don't aren't accustomed to that sort of thing, it can have a

707
01:11:51.76 --> 01:11:58.56
really, really negative emotional impact. Oh yeah. We had one of my buddies, Micah Fink,

708
01:11:58.56 --> 01:12:04.96
who runs an awesome organization helping vets. But he said something when he was on the podcast

709
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:10.80
about like, you are giving the energy to the thing that's eating you. So like your husband just

710
01:12:10.80 --> 01:12:15.28
going, Oh, you know what? I've had enough of this delete. Yeah. That and one of our friends, Jack

711
01:12:15.28 --> 01:12:22.08
Daniel, Jack Daniel Hill just went on like a retreat into the mountains. And I was like, Oh,

712
01:12:22.08 --> 01:12:27.20
how was it? You know, just talking to him. And the first thing he goes, it was four days, no phone,

713
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:33.20
no watch, didn't even know what time it was. And he said, when he got back, he said, it was such a

714
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:40.64
good like dopamine reset because you realize what that phone does to you, like how it makes you feel.

715
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:44.16
And you know, it's like, I talk about fasting from food. And one of the best things you get

716
01:12:44.16 --> 01:12:50.48
from a food fast is it recalibrates your hunger, right? Like you think like it's been two hours,

717
01:12:50.48 --> 01:12:58.24
dude, I'm starving. You're an idiot, right? And then you get done with like a fast, a three day

718
01:12:58.24 --> 01:13:04.16
fast. And you're like, I'm not even close to hungry. I'm fine. And so the dopamine hit on the phone

719
01:13:04.16 --> 01:13:10.16
is the same thing. Like you take a break from that thing. And you go, Oh, this thing is running my

720
01:13:10.16 --> 01:13:15.60
brain. Yeah, it's got it's got ownership of my brain. You can't let that happen. Yeah. And you

721
01:13:15.60 --> 01:13:22.88
don't even realize it. Yeah, that documentary social dilemma was very eyeopening in how intentional,

722
01:13:22.88 --> 01:13:29.76
completely intentional. Like they're looking for that exact effect. Oh, completely like the smallest,

723
01:13:29.76 --> 01:13:37.28
littlest things like opportunity for exploitation, left, right and center and it's constant. And it's

724
01:13:37.28 --> 01:13:43.44
a yeah, I used to wear an Apple watch and I don't anymore specifically because like, I don't need

725
01:13:43.44 --> 01:13:48.000
that. Oh, constantly, constantly. You know, I tell the weird thing is like on Twitter,

726
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.32
obviously, and look, I like Twitter. And what I like about Twitter is it's fun, because it's

727
01:13:56.32 --> 01:14:02.24
basically for my, for lack of a better word, personality, you get to sit there and make

728
01:14:02.24 --> 01:14:07.60
one liners. Yeah, it's basically just one liners and and it's easier than one liners if you and I

729
01:14:07.60 --> 01:14:11.76
are talking because if you and I are talking, I have to do a one liner on the spot. I have one

730
01:14:11.76 --> 01:14:16.000
second thing about it. I got to do it. Yeah, with Twitter, I can take seven minutes to think of a

731
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.44
really good one line, right? So of course, you're going to win. Of course, you're going to sound

732
01:14:19.44 --> 01:14:24.88
you're going to sound funny or whatever. And it's a fun thing to do. But man, sometimes I'll like

733
01:14:24.88 --> 01:14:31.12
read someone that's putting something on Twitter. And you can see that they're putting some little

734
01:14:31.12 --> 01:14:35.28
fraction of their of their soul into it. Maybe that's a strong word, but they're putting at least

735
01:14:35.28 --> 01:14:40.40
some level of effort of like, Hey, I want to make this point, people have to hear this. What I'm

736
01:14:40.40 --> 01:14:45.12
about to say is going to have impact. And I'm thinking, I'm sorry, man, but like, if you're

737
01:14:45.12 --> 01:14:49.20
looking to change the world, you shouldn't be trying to change the world on Twitter. You should

738
01:14:49.20 --> 01:14:52.96
be trying to change the world through some other things, start a business, grow a company, go out

739
01:14:52.96 --> 01:14:58.32
and talk to people and communicate with them in a broad long term format. But but to sit there and

740
01:14:58.32 --> 01:15:03.36
be like, All right, this is the thread. This is the thread that's really going to change things

741
01:15:03.36 --> 01:15:09.04
up. This is the one. So I think that's a little bit sketchy. And you have to watch out for that.

742
01:15:09.04 --> 01:15:15.84
And and again, I also think that Twitter, originally as a method of communication, when I

743
01:15:15.84 --> 01:15:19.60
originally got on it, Tim Ferriss, he says to me, Oh, no, it's a really good way to like,

744
01:15:19.60 --> 01:15:22.40
talk to people and communicate with them. And you can get a bunch of information. I was like,

745
01:15:22.40 --> 01:15:27.12
Oh, I guess that sounds cool. And at some point, Twitter went from a way to communicate with a

746
01:15:27.12 --> 01:15:29.76
bunch of people and have them communicate back to you and people you don't know, and it's all good.

747
01:15:29.76 --> 01:15:35.84
And we can all it went from that sort of a positive communication. And I still think I feel I still

748
01:15:35.84 --> 01:15:39.12
feel that way about it. Like I'll go on have all kinds of positive, really good interactions

749
01:15:39.12 --> 01:15:45.04
with people. I'm probably the only person that's just on there trying to have a positive interaction.

750
01:15:45.04 --> 01:15:49.92
Even when people say negative stuff to me on Twitter, I always say, Oh, that's a cool perspective.

751
01:15:49.92 --> 01:15:54.40
Thank you. Like, well, that makes sense. I never thought of it that way. And let me keep an open

752
01:15:54.40 --> 01:15:59.76
mind here. Instead of just going on the attack. But yeah, people got to watch out for that one.

753
01:15:59.76 --> 01:16:08.16
Yeah. So my approach is a little different than yours. I am and you know, the, you know, social

754
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:14.40
media strategists may have have some, some constructive feedback here, but I do try to be

755
01:16:14.40 --> 01:16:20.48
pretty intentional about things that I put out on social media at real large, but Twitter limitation

756
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:25.84
of space, I put, I put some thought into the statements that I'm making in the hope that it

757
01:16:25.84 --> 01:16:30.40
will have an impact, at least causing people to ask a question or maybe stop and think about

758
01:16:30.40 --> 01:16:36.96
whatever the topic is that I'm commenting on and using it as a platform to help inform and engage

759
01:16:37.52 --> 01:16:44.56
on, on the issues, issues of the day. It's challenging because it's so short. But to me,

760
01:16:44.56 --> 01:16:48.56
all of these different platforms, yes, there's, there's positives and negatives to them. So I want

761
01:16:48.56 --> 01:16:56.40
to try to, I do, I want to be very intentional about what I am putting out responses, you know,

762
01:16:56.96 --> 01:17:02.24
cross, cross the spectrum. But to me, this is like really the thing is like people are like, oh,

763
01:17:02.24 --> 01:17:08.40
you know, I always laugh at the comments that are like, Oh, I hate what you say, or you're so ignorant,

764
01:17:08.40 --> 01:17:14.64
or you're terrible, all of these different things like dude, unfollow. It's as simple as that. Or

765
01:17:14.64 --> 01:17:20.08
you should not be allowed to speak and da da da da da da unfollow. And that's, that's where like,

766
01:17:20.08 --> 01:17:26.000
you see how again, people in government and people in positions of power, like, well, we need to ban

767
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.16
hate speech, we need to ban misinformation and disinformation. Who gets to decide what that is?

768
01:17:33.28 --> 01:17:38.32
You know, your, you know, what echo might think is hate speech, maybe different from what you

769
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:42.24
might consider hate speech, what's offensive to him might be different than what's offensive to you.

770
01:17:42.24 --> 01:17:47.92
You know, Missy, we saw this through the COVID pandemic, right? One day, Dr. Fauci says, oh,

771
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:52.96
masks are useless, don't go buy them. Then the next day is like, well, actually, everybody really has

772
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:57.92
to wear a mask. Like, okay, so who gets to say what is misinformation and disinformation and what

773
01:17:57.92 --> 01:18:06.16
should be banned versus not banned. The postmortem on the COVID is very crazy to look at. Yeah,

774
01:18:06.16 --> 01:18:09.92
it's a great case study for what we're talking about. The last time you were here, the last time

775
01:18:09.92 --> 01:18:14.48
you were here, you did do a podcast, but you were in town and Echo and I were here and you just

776
01:18:14.48 --> 01:18:21.84
were like, hey, I'm in town, swing by. And so you were here. Echo and I were like, way beyond COVID.

777
01:18:22.88 --> 01:18:27.52
I guess we were just like not wearing masks, not doing anything. You were here, you were still,

778
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.76
you were still in Congress. You were here, you had two masks on. We ended up having,

779
01:18:33.76 --> 01:18:39.28
I had enough, having to send you the horrible text of like, hey, I'm really sorry, but both Echo

780
01:18:39.28 --> 01:18:46.000
and I have COVID after you left. But what you, when you look back, what do you think of that whole

781
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.96
gig, that whole COVID thing? Like it was mayhem. It was, it was mayhem and a lot of it was caused by

782
01:18:55.04 --> 01:19:02.08
a lot of, I mean, look, I mean, Fauci was lying about masks because he didn't want people to go

783
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:08.24
buy masks because he felt like there wasn't enough masks for healthcare professionals.

784
01:19:08.24 --> 01:19:14.48
And I think at different points, you know, you saw how you're not allowed to go to church,

785
01:19:14.48 --> 01:19:19.12
not allowed to go to a funeral, not allowed to have a wedding. You're not allowed to gather with

786
01:19:19.12 --> 01:19:22.64
friends in your house, not allowed to have birthday parties, but-

787
01:19:22.64 --> 01:19:25.84
You go to Home Depot, Walmart and McDonald's.

788
01:19:25.84 --> 01:19:32.48
Home Depot, Walmart, McDonald's, or 50,000 people in a Black Lives Matter, March, shoulder to shoulder.

789
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:39.04
Social distancing, six feet apart, like, yeah, no. And just the direct statements that these so-called

790
01:19:39.52 --> 01:19:44.72
healthcare professionals made during that time was like, oh, well, you know, the cause is worthy.

791
01:19:45.60 --> 01:19:50.72
So therefore, it outweighs the risk of COVID. But your kids are not allowed to go to school.

792
01:19:51.76 --> 01:19:59.68
My whole perspective on this is individual choice. And so for me, like, I travel a lot,

793
01:19:59.68 --> 01:20:03.76
I do a lot. I don't want to get sick. I was wearing masks on planes before COVID happened

794
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:09.12
because I can't afford to have days out where I can't do what I need to do, whether that was in

795
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:14.40
Congress or now. You know, I have people in my family who have compromised immune systems.

796
01:20:14.40 --> 01:20:20.72
So generally, I am more careful than your average person because I can't afford to get sick.

797
01:20:21.60 --> 01:20:29.52
But it comes down to the idea of individual choice was thrown out the window. And we saw

798
01:20:29.52 --> 01:20:35.68
how people in power were claiming to act in the best interest of quote, unquote, public health.

799
01:20:36.32 --> 01:20:43.04
But it really got to a point where this was about compliance or face the consequences. It became

800
01:20:43.04 --> 01:20:48.08
about power. And that's the dangerous thing as we look back at what happened.

801
01:20:48.08 --> 01:20:52.000
How much did government trust decay because of COVID?

802
01:20:53.28 --> 01:20:54.72
How much did government trust what?

803
01:20:54.72 --> 01:20:55.36
Decay.

804
01:20:55.36 --> 01:20:56.16
What do you mean?

805
01:20:56.16 --> 01:21:00.64
I mean, people that maybe before COVID would be like, oh, you know, government's saying something.

806
01:21:00.64 --> 01:21:04.56
It's, you know, it's the government decaying trust in the government. Yeah, exactly.

807
01:21:05.76 --> 01:21:13.92
I think I think that that lack of trust went up dramatically. Because, you know, God, what was it?

808
01:21:13.92 --> 01:21:18.80
One of these mainstream media, I don't know if it's the New York Times, New York, or one of these

809
01:21:18.80 --> 01:21:22.48
had an op-ed recently published where they're just like, oh, people should just forgive

810
01:21:22.48 --> 01:21:28.96
people like Dr. Fauci for being wrong because, hey, nobody really knew what was going on.

811
01:21:29.68 --> 01:21:34.72
And a lot of parents being like, hold on a second, you know, my kid was out of school for two years

812
01:21:34.72 --> 01:21:39.84
and you want us to just forgive and forget as my kids trying to, you know, play catch up or,

813
01:21:40.40 --> 01:21:47.28
just whatever, you know, again, like I've, families who could not go and see a loved one

814
01:21:47.28 --> 01:21:53.76
in the hospital before they died. There's not a whole lot of forgive and forget, I think,

815
01:21:53.76 --> 01:21:57.44
going on by people who really, really were, you know, small business owners who were forced out

816
01:21:57.44 --> 01:22:02.64
of business. And there's just so many different examples. You know, from a leadership perspective,

817
01:22:03.76 --> 01:22:09.28
you have to be honest with people about what you know and what you don't know and what's like

818
01:22:09.28 --> 01:22:14.40
your best guess and what, and look, it never inspires confidence, right? If we're in combat

819
01:22:14.40 --> 01:22:22.08
and I say, hey, Tulsi, I guess you should move to that next building, right? Like,

820
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:25.92
that doesn't inspire the kind of confidence that people want to hear. But if you and I are working

821
01:22:25.92 --> 01:22:31.44
together and you know that, listen, all leadership decisions are a guess, they really are. You're

822
01:22:31.44 --> 01:22:37.04
not making any leadership decisions that I know 100 or very few. Let me rephrase that. Very few

823
01:22:37.04 --> 01:22:41.52
leadership decisions that you make as a human being in a leadership position, you know 100%

824
01:22:41.52 --> 01:22:46.32
what's going to happen. And if you did, then who cares, right? If I know 100%, oh, I know 100%

825
01:22:46.32 --> 01:22:50.40
if we make this investment, we will 100%, that's not even a decision, right? That's just a smart

826
01:22:50.40 --> 01:22:54.88
move that you're going to make. If I knew on the battlefield 100%, if you take down this building,

827
01:22:54.88 --> 01:22:59.60
we're going to get the flank on the enemy and not lose anybody. Great. That's not a,

828
01:22:59.60 --> 01:23:06.08
that's just a move, right? But when it comes to making decisions, you got to recognize number one

829
01:23:06.08 --> 01:23:10.24
that, hey, this is a guess that I'm making right now based on the information that I have. And

830
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:14.40
when more information comes out, I'm probably going to have to make adjustments to what I said

831
01:23:14.96 --> 01:23:21.52
15 minutes ago, 15 days ago, 15 weeks ago or whatever. And yet it seemed like people's egos

832
01:23:21.52 --> 01:23:27.84
were so fragile that they just dug in and just, even when it made no sense anymore. Even when it

833
01:23:27.84 --> 01:23:32.72
made, after they had the freaking Super Bowl in Los Angeles with how many people were there at

834
01:23:32.72 --> 01:23:38.24
Coach Charles? I don't know. 80,000 or something like this. And they're all in there. And then

835
01:23:38.24 --> 01:23:45.68
in LA at that time, I had gone to LA for something. It was full on, I'm like, everyone's wearing a

836
01:23:45.68 --> 01:23:50.08
mask. And then they had the Super Bowl and no one's wearing a mask. And then they go back and

837
01:23:51.28 --> 01:23:55.52
it didn't make sense. And no one said, Hey, you know what? What we thought a month ago, two months

838
01:23:55.52 --> 01:24:01.76
ago, whatever, we've adjusted what we were thinking because we might have been wrong about that. And

839
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:05.04
here's what we're thinking now. This is our best guess. This is how we're going to move forward.

840
01:24:05.04 --> 01:24:12.32
None of that happened. It was freaking ridiculous. And the crazy thing is, as someone who has,

841
01:24:12.32 --> 01:24:17.68
especially in the military, but in politics, been exposed to good leaders and bad leaders,

842
01:24:18.48 --> 01:24:25.28
what I would hope for from someone in a leadership position is just that honesty and transparency.

843
01:24:25.28 --> 01:24:29.12
Say, Hey, here's the decision that we made based on the information that we had.

844
01:24:29.12 --> 01:24:33.68
We have new information. And so here is the guidance or here's the direction

845
01:24:33.68 --> 01:24:41.12
that we're headed. Like that would engender more trust and more respect to those in positions of

846
01:24:41.12 --> 01:24:47.76
power and leadership rather than exactly what you're saying we saw where they were more concerned

847
01:24:47.76 --> 01:24:54.16
about not admitting like, Hey, we got that one a little wrong. We're going to adjust and kind of

848
01:24:54.16 --> 01:24:59.92
course correct. They're more concerned about that than they were about actually doing what was right

849
01:24:59.92 --> 01:25:03.76
and what was best and not concerned for the consequences, more concerned for themselves

850
01:25:03.76 --> 01:25:08.96
and how people might perceive them. Yeah. And that's what's weird. Everybody knows.

851
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:14.24
Everybody knows. I asked hundreds of people this question when I talk about leadership,

852
01:25:14.24 --> 01:25:19.12
like if I go to you and I say, Hey, Tulsi, I'm not really sure how to conduct this mission.

853
01:25:19.12 --> 01:25:23.44
What do you think we should do? Yeah. Everybody knows that that's a better attitude

854
01:25:24.24 --> 01:25:28.000
and better leadership than if I'm not really sure how to conduct an operation. I say, All right,

855
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.72
Tulsi, here's how we're doing it. And this is what we're going to do because I said so.

856
01:25:33.28 --> 01:25:37.36
Everybody knows that the first leader that asked for input and has an open mind,

857
01:25:37.36 --> 01:25:42.000
everybody knows that leader is more respected. Everybody knows that. And yet when we're in

858
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.76
the leadership position, we decide to think, You know what? Everyone's going to think I'm,

859
01:25:45.76 --> 01:25:50.88
I don't know what I'm doing. If I ask Tulsi what her opinion is, it's freaking totally ridiculous.

860
01:25:50.88 --> 01:25:57.68
And it's totally wrong. And yet it's our ego, our ego so strong that it overpowers our

861
01:25:57.68 --> 01:26:02.08
actual knowledge of what good leadership is. We all know the better leader says, Hey,

862
01:26:02.08 --> 01:26:05.36
you know, I'm never conducting operation like this before Tulsi, I know you have,

863
01:26:05.36 --> 01:26:09.28
how do you think we should do it? Everybody knows that that's better leadership than

864
01:26:09.28 --> 01:26:13.04
Tulsi's got a bunch of experience in this type of operation. I've never done it before, but

865
01:26:13.04 --> 01:26:16.000
I don't want to look bad. So I'm going to dictate how we're doing it. Everybody knows that that's

866
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.88
bad. Yeah. And yet our ego pushes us to do that. It's, it's ridiculous. That's how strong the ego

867
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:27.68
is. One of my favorite series of all times is band of brothers. And it was something that

868
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:33.76
I first learned about as an E. I'd just gotten into the army national guard. We did our annual

869
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:38.80
training at Fort Indian town gap in Pennsylvania. And I had happened to pick up the book band of

870
01:26:38.80 --> 01:26:44.72
brothers by Dick Winters. As we were out there was reading it was on the plane going back to

871
01:26:44.72 --> 01:26:49.44
Hawaii when I finished it in the very back of the book, it says, you know, Dick Winters has

872
01:26:49.44 --> 01:26:53.28
now retired and is residing in Fort Indian town gap. Pennsylvania house like, Oh my God,

873
01:26:53.28 --> 01:26:57.92
I would have loved to go knock on that guy's door. That would have been incredible. But

874
01:26:57.92 --> 01:27:02.80
I've watched that series so many times in OCS. We actually had, we watched episode by episode,

875
01:27:02.80 --> 01:27:08.56
we had to write essays on each episode talking about leadership lessons. And for those who've

876
01:27:08.56 --> 01:27:15.36
seen it, the captain sobel character who was Ross from friends, he is that guy. He is that guy who

877
01:27:15.36 --> 01:27:21.84
was totally driven by ego did not care about what was right or drawing from experience or anything

878
01:27:21.84 --> 01:27:28.32
else. He was right to a fault and his soldiers suffered and they lacked any respect for him,

879
01:27:28.32 --> 01:27:35.28
like blatantly saluted the rank solely. But that was it, like following him into combat terrified

880
01:27:35.28 --> 01:27:40.96
them. And they talked about this and raised this through their chain of command versus Dick Winters,

881
01:27:40.96 --> 01:27:47.28
the guy who really represented and embodied those, those, the, the characteristics of servant

882
01:27:47.28 --> 01:27:53.60
leadership and humility and, you know, drawing on the strengths of his NCOs and his men to be

883
01:27:53.60 --> 01:27:57.68
able to make sure that they were taking care of each other and accomplishing the mission.

884
01:27:57.68 --> 01:28:03.12
Yeah. At Escalon front, we do that. We, we actually take chunks of band of brothers and talk about

885
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:10.56
it. And again, everybody knows that captain sobel is hated. And everybody knows that when you

886
01:28:10.56 --> 01:28:14.56
come, when you try and demand respect from people, it doesn't work. Everybody knows that. And yet

887
01:28:14.56 --> 01:28:19.52
people freaking do it. Escalon front, my leadership company wouldn't exist if this stuff, if people

888
01:28:19.52 --> 01:28:26.88
could just, just kind of execute on what they know. Yeah. But that ego is so strong that it just

889
01:28:26.88 --> 01:28:32.24
overpowers the ability to listen to what other people have to say. It overpowers the people,

890
01:28:32.88 --> 01:28:37.76
the ability to allow themselves to be influenced by what other people are saying. They think of

891
01:28:37.76 --> 01:28:41.84
that as weakness. If you say, Hey, Nako, I think we should attack this target from the north instead

892
01:28:41.84 --> 01:28:46.40
of from the west. And in my mind, I think, wait a second, I'm going to look weak if I accept

893
01:28:46.40 --> 01:28:53.04
Tulsi's input right now. So no, right. Our ego just drives us. And this is again,

894
01:28:53.04 --> 01:29:01.12
I think this is one of the major issues that we see in America is that a lot of times people think,

895
01:29:01.68 --> 01:29:06.64
I'm going to look weak if I do this, I'm going to look bad, or I don't want to submit.

896
01:29:06.64 --> 01:29:11.68
I don't want to subordinate my ego. I don't want, I don't want Tulsi to be the one that had the good

897
01:29:11.68 --> 01:29:17.68
idea. So I'm not going to use her idea. I'd rather just fail. It's in a crazy, it happens in business

898
01:29:17.68 --> 01:29:21.92
a lot where I come up with the idea, my idea is not working, but it was my idea. So I'm just going

899
01:29:21.92 --> 01:29:28.32
to lose. I'm going to go bankrupt. And people think, no, no one would do that. Oh, yes, they will.

900
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:35.28
And they do. And the extreme example is combat. There's plenty of historical examples where people

901
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:42.40
where people have gotten their troops killed and in some cases gotten themselves killed

902
01:29:42.40 --> 01:29:45.68
because they just didn't want to, they didn't want to say, you know what, I was wrong about this word.

903
01:29:45.68 --> 01:29:50.16
We shouldn't attack. We shouldn't do a frontal assault right now. We should actually take a step

904
01:29:50.16 --> 01:29:54.64
back, maybe retreat a little bit and come and attack a different day. There's plenty of examples

905
01:29:54.64 --> 01:29:59.28
in history where people die because their ego gets in the way. So it happens in business. And if it

906
01:29:59.28 --> 01:30:03.04
can happen in, in business and people can bankrupt a company, it can happen in battle and people

907
01:30:03.04 --> 01:30:08.16
can get people killed. It will certainly happen all day on Twitter where people say, I would

908
01:30:08.16 --> 01:30:12.96
rather just perish than, than admit that, oh, that's a good point. I didn't think through that.

909
01:30:13.84 --> 01:30:19.04
And obviously it happens in politics every single day. And I think the interesting thing about that

910
01:30:19.04 --> 01:30:24.88
is these are decisions that are made out of fear. Their motivation is fear ultimately is

911
01:30:25.60 --> 01:30:30.16
themselves looking stupid or silly or not getting the credit or whatever it is. And I, I could

912
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:36.40
the examples day and night, I could tell you in politics how people who are elected into these

913
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:44.88
positions of leadership are really followers who are looking to react to certain situations,

914
01:30:44.88 --> 01:30:49.04
what will put me in the best light, you know, how can I take advantage of this to further myself

915
01:30:49.68 --> 01:30:55.44
or make those decisions based on fear, fear of like, Hey, I don't want to stand out from the

916
01:30:55.44 --> 01:31:00.56
crowd. I don't want to get this criticism. I don't want to be ostracized by this group or that group.

917
01:31:00.56 --> 01:31:06.16
Or what if these people don't like me or what if, you know, I don't get the credit for this. And,

918
01:31:06.16 --> 01:31:12.64
and that was, you know, one of the first days that I had as a new member of Congress in Washington,

919
01:31:13.76 --> 01:31:19.28
you know, the message from Democratic Party leadership was like, Hey, you, you need to make

920
01:31:19.28 --> 01:31:24.24
sure that, that we as a party get the credit for what you're doing. So if there's a bill with a

921
01:31:24.24 --> 01:31:29.04
good idea that one of your Republican colleagues puts forward and they want you to join them on it,

922
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:33.76
don't do it because you'll make them look good. Just take their idea and you introduce the bill

923
01:31:33.76 --> 01:31:40.72
so that you and therefore the Democrats get credit for it. And then, and only then will we advance

924
01:31:40.72 --> 01:31:44.80
that idea because if it's the other guys and now, you know, we'll just let that bill die silently

925
01:31:44.80 --> 01:31:54.72
in the night. And, and, you know, if, if this were just, you know, I don't know, running for

926
01:31:54.72 --> 01:31:59.60
class president in high school, that'd be one thing. But then you take this example and you

927
01:31:59.60 --> 01:32:04.48
look at people who are making decisions based on our foreign policy and where and when our men

928
01:32:04.48 --> 01:32:11.60
and women are sent into combat and not being willing to say, Hey, we got that one wrong or,

929
01:32:11.60 --> 01:32:16.16
Hey, we need to relook at how we're thinking about this problem set and ask the question,

930
01:32:16.16 --> 01:32:19.76
how does this best serve the interests of the United States, our national security,

931
01:32:19.76 --> 01:32:24.80
the interest of the American people, instead of like, I got to look tough, I got to be strong,

932
01:32:24.80 --> 01:32:31.12
I got to pound my chest. And the, the unfortunate, and this is why I talk a lot about how the most

933
01:32:31.12 --> 01:32:35.36
important responsibility the president has is to serve as commander in chief and the danger of

934
01:32:35.36 --> 01:32:42.40
having a weak minded person in that position who does not understand the seriousness of that job

935
01:32:42.96 --> 01:32:48.24
is they feel they have to prove their strength and what better way to prove that strength

936
01:32:48.24 --> 01:32:54.32
than to say, Hey, I'm going to go drop some bombs. I'm going to go send in, you know, our, our meanest,

937
01:32:54.32 --> 01:32:59.52
baddest fighters to go into a certain situation or start a war, insert ourselves into a conflict

938
01:32:59.52 --> 01:33:05.84
without actually saying, Hey, maybe exercising restraint in the situation is actually the,

939
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:11.76
not only the right move, but it's the power move. It's the move that actually serves the

940
01:33:11.76 --> 01:33:16.72
interest of our country. And that's, that's the dangerous consequence of exactly what you're

941
01:33:16.72 --> 01:33:22.24
talking about of ego and, and leaders making decisions based on emotion and fear, rather

942
01:33:22.24 --> 01:33:26.56
than actual assessment of, all right, what are we looking at? What are the consequences of course

943
01:33:26.56 --> 01:33:30.16
of action, a, b, c, and d? And what exactly are we trying to accomplish?

944
01:33:32.64 --> 01:33:38.96
It's freaking depressing. Is there any, is there any freaking light at the end of the tunnel

945
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:46.48
for our government? Yes. What is it? Us. The light, the light at the end of the tunnel is

946
01:33:47.12 --> 01:33:54.64
people who are frustrated by the status quo, people who are concerned for what kind of future

947
01:33:54.64 --> 01:33:59.12
that we want to leave behind for our kids, what kind of country you want them to grow up in?

948
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:08.72
Be, when I say be the change, it's, it's recognized the vision that our founders had for this country

949
01:34:08.72 --> 01:34:16.72
that, you know, literally escaping control and being governed by a monarchy where the people

950
01:34:16.72 --> 01:34:22.24
had no say to forming this country based on the foundation of a self governed people.

951
01:34:22.24 --> 01:34:27.60
And what, what does that actually mean? What does that look like? It's we, the people, fulfilling

952
01:34:27.60 --> 01:34:33.68
our responsibility in selecting leaders who truly are a government of the people by the people and

953
01:34:33.68 --> 01:34:37.92
for the people. There's a lot of different ways that any one of us can get involved and, and, and

954
01:34:37.92 --> 01:34:45.76
be a part of that. But the basic, the bare minimum is cast your vote and do a little bit of work,

955
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:50.88
just a little bit to make sure that the votes that you're casting are based on, you know,

956
01:34:50.88 --> 01:34:58.08
informed, you know, figure out, figure out what you, what you want. And this is not to say, you

957
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:03.60
know, you'll hear in politics like, Oh, one side only wants to get their side out to vote and hopes

958
01:35:03.60 --> 01:35:09.12
everybody else stays home. The more we have this open marketplace of ideas, the more we exercise

959
01:35:09.12 --> 01:35:14.56
our rights and freedoms and make sure that our voices are heard, then we have the kind of robust

960
01:35:14.56 --> 01:35:20.64
democracy that, that our founders envisioned. Again, back to the depressing viewpoint over

961
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:29.92
from Jaco is the game that gets played as far as the whole political system, the game that's getting

962
01:35:29.92 --> 01:35:37.20
played is not conducive to people, Hey, okay, this is what I'm thinking right now. And this is what

963
01:35:37.20 --> 01:35:41.04
my beliefs are, and I'm going to go out and vote. And therefore, if a bunch of people are thinking

964
01:35:41.04 --> 01:35:46.56
like me, then we'll probably do okay. The game that's being played is like it's all about how

965
01:35:46.56 --> 01:35:51.36
much money can you put into advertising and how much how many people can you get to vote? And

966
01:35:51.36 --> 01:35:56.88
what methodology is there for voting? I mean, some of the voting things are crazy. Some of the things

967
01:35:56.88 --> 01:36:05.04
that happen with with voting and the way voting takes place. So it seems like the game that the

968
01:36:05.04 --> 01:36:14.96
politicians are playing, there's, you know, the, that the people are just sort of pawns that are

969
01:36:14.96 --> 01:36:19.92
yep, here's what we're going to do to get the pawns to vote this way. And here's what the, we'll

970
01:36:19.92 --> 01:36:26.000
get the result that we want. All of that is absolutely true. And knowing that that is true

971
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.28
and knowing that that's the case is so important for us to know as voters what we're being subjected

972
01:36:31.28 --> 01:36:37.84
to and why and is exactly to try to manipulate us to vote in the way that one side or the other

973
01:36:37.84 --> 01:36:44.72
wants us to. And knowing that, then we can take a step back and again, encourage that critical

974
01:36:44.72 --> 01:36:49.28
thinking, encourage that as you're getting information, whether it's on a television ad or

975
01:36:49.28 --> 01:36:57.84
a social media post or a news article, exercise your own discernment and pause for a minute,

976
01:36:57.84 --> 01:37:03.52
think about, okay, well, what, what is their bias? What are they, what do they want me to think? Or

977
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:08.32
how do they want me to react to this? There are, there's some apps out there. I know there's,

978
01:37:08.32 --> 01:37:13.76
there's a bunch, there's one that I have on my phone called Allsides. And it's an app that will

979
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:19.28
present kind of the news headlines of the day. And it'll say, well, this new source is left

980
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:23.60
leaning, this one is neutral, this one is right leaning. And it's not foolproof by any means,

981
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:28.96
but there, there's some quick ways to kind of look out there and get a little bit of an idea of

982
01:37:28.96 --> 01:37:35.20
what direction or angle or bias a certain media source has taken so that you know, okay, well,

983
01:37:35.20 --> 01:37:39.84
if I read this, then okay, well, that's, that's kind of the outcome they want me to have. But

984
01:37:39.84 --> 01:37:44.32
being aware of that, I think is the first step. There are a lot of other policy changes that,

985
01:37:44.32 --> 01:37:48.16
that I think need to take place to address some of the problems that we're talking about. But

986
01:37:48.16 --> 01:37:55.92
that can only happen when we throw out leaders who are abusing their power and actually start to get

987
01:37:55.92 --> 01:38:00.64
real leaders into office who, who will take us in, in the right direction.

988
01:38:01.60 --> 01:38:05.60
When you say policy changes to address some of the things that have happened, what, like,

989
01:38:05.60 --> 01:38:06.48
what do you mean?

990
01:38:07.04 --> 01:38:12.80
I mean, the big tech, I think is, is a, is a huge one that as long as politicians are in the

991
01:38:12.80 --> 01:38:18.56
pockets and getting money from the Googles and meddas of the world, we're not going to see those

992
01:38:18.56 --> 01:38:23.68
kinds of changes take place. We hear a lot, I've heard a lot from both Democrats and Republicans

993
01:38:23.68 --> 01:38:28.40
about, oh, you know, big tech monopolies are such a big problem. It's like, yeah, okay, so

994
01:38:28.80 --> 01:38:33.28
what are you doing about it? And when you look at it, like, they're not, they're not doing

995
01:38:33.28 --> 01:38:38.56
anything about it. Actually, there's a, you know, a healthy debate and conversation needs to be

996
01:38:38.56 --> 01:38:46.56
had about how do you, you know, what role does government play in regulating these, these monopolies?

997
01:38:46.56 --> 01:38:56.000
I think first, you know, there's section 230 within the US code provides big tech, essentially,

998
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
with the legal immunity that a publisher like the New York Times does not have. Because originally,

999
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.20
they thought, okay, well, big tech, you know, like, they, they're not going to be, to be an

1000
01:39:07.20 --> 01:39:12.24
arbiter and a curator of information, they're just going to be, you know, an online platform,

1001
01:39:12.24 --> 01:39:16.24
whereas the New York Times does curate, you know, what letters to the editor they choose to publish

1002
01:39:16.24 --> 01:39:22.000
or the articles they choose to publish. But in reality, in an application, these big tech

1003
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.40
monopolies are exactly, they're curating very, very carefully every single thing that we see.

1004
01:39:29.04 --> 01:39:35.12
And yet they are not being held legally liable in the same way that a publisher would. So that's,

1005
01:39:35.12 --> 01:39:39.76
that's kind of basic number one of like, okay, how should they be treated? Some say they should

1006
01:39:39.76 --> 01:39:45.44
be treated as utility, much like the phone company where, you know, the phone company doesn't control

1007
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:52.16
who calls who or the content of any conversation. They are just a platform for us to be able to

1008
01:39:52.16 --> 01:39:59.36
communicate and talk to each other. So I think, I think this big tech obviously does not want to

1009
01:39:59.36 --> 01:40:06.56
lose that legal immunity. If they are a free speech platform, then be a free speech platform.

1010
01:40:06.56 --> 01:40:10.08
If they're a platform that says, well, we're only going to push these certain viewpoints,

1011
01:40:10.08 --> 01:40:17.28
then people know that and we'll know that going in. That's, that's a, that's an important place

1012
01:40:17.28 --> 01:40:25.28
to start to make it so that these monopolies, I have been a big fan of breaking up big tech,

1013
01:40:25.28 --> 01:40:32.000
breaking up a big tech using existing provisions within the law that

1014
01:40:32.56 --> 01:40:34.72
like standard antitrust type. Exactly.

1015
01:40:35.92 --> 01:40:40.72
To, to avoid exactly what we are seeing now, where you can say, oh, well, you know, you can use duck

1016
01:40:40.72 --> 01:40:47.36
dot go instead of Google, but you're not going to get the same kind of effect and reach of being

1017
01:40:47.36 --> 01:40:51.84
able to get as much information as you would because Google has a monopoly.

1018
01:40:51.84 --> 01:40:58.48
I think there are different approaches to this, but recognizing the problem and how they're directly

1019
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:06.32
interfering in our elections. As one major example, we talked about Chloe Cole. There are other

1020
01:41:06.32 --> 01:41:11.92
situations that like the Biden, the Hunter Biden laptop. Exactly. That's a great example.

1021
01:41:11.92 --> 01:41:19.92
Is that not crazy? It's insane. It's insane. How, how, you know, for, for people who don't know,

1022
01:41:19.92 --> 01:41:26.48
it was like just weeks before the general election in 2020, hugely consequential election.

1023
01:41:27.12 --> 01:41:31.44
You have this discovery of a laptop that Hunter Biden left at a computer store.

1024
01:41:33.28 --> 01:41:41.44
And then you have, I think it was at 50 or 51, either current or retired senior

1025
01:41:41.44 --> 01:41:47.44
intelligence officials like people who headed the CIA coming out with a blanket statement saying

1026
01:41:47.44 --> 01:41:51.76
that the contents of this laptop should not be released because it could be disinformation

1027
01:41:51.76 --> 01:41:58.000
from Russia trying to influence the outcome of our election. And then, I don't know,

1028
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.96
was it the FBI who told Facebook not to? Yeah, I told Facebook to expect Russian propaganda in the,

1029
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:12.48
in the near future. Right. And then that kind of got put in with it. And Mark Zuckerberg on

1030
01:42:12.48 --> 01:42:17.84
Rogan's podcast said, he, he said he didn't do what Twitter did was Twitter just, would just

1031
01:42:17.84 --> 01:42:23.36
deleted any of those tweets that were pointing people in that direction. Facebook just downplayed

1032
01:42:23.36 --> 01:42:29.84
it or deescalated its, its growth. So no one really saw it, which, which is essentially the same thing.

1033
01:42:29.84 --> 01:42:36.40
Yeah. And that's like, you can't, that seems totally insane that that happened. Well, you think

1034
01:42:36.40 --> 01:42:43.20
about why, why, why did they do this? It was because they were concerned. Oh yeah. That the

1035
01:42:43.20 --> 01:42:49.60
information on the laptop would cause people to not vote for Joe Biden and instead vote for Donald

1036
01:42:49.60 --> 01:42:58.000
Trump. Not a single one of those. I forget what news outlet it was, but they went back once the,

1037
01:42:58.64 --> 01:43:03.76
obviously the election was over and the information on the laptop had been released,

1038
01:43:03.76 --> 01:43:08.40
had gone back to any of those senior intelligence or all of them actually, they reached out to all

1039
01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:13.44
of them to say, Hey, now that you know what you know, do you regret making the statement that

1040
01:43:13.44 --> 01:43:20.08
you made blaming Russia on this? Uh, and many of them didn't respond to the question. Those that

1041
01:43:20.08 --> 01:43:26.56
did not a single one of them said, I regret it or I was wrong. Not a single one of them. Most of

1042
01:43:26.56 --> 01:43:34.48
them saying, well, I stand by my statement. This is, this is such an egregious, I mean, this has to,

1043
01:43:34.48 --> 01:43:41.20
this has to be called out for, for what it is. This is people in, in major positions of power

1044
01:43:41.20 --> 01:43:47.12
and influence, essentially stealing our democracy, stealing our right as voters, voters to have all

1045
01:43:47.12 --> 01:43:51.44
the information available to us before making this hugely consequential, consequential decision on

1046
01:43:51.44 --> 01:43:56.16
who our president should be. But yet this is the problem, right? This is the game that you're

1047
01:43:56.16 --> 01:43:59.84
talking about. This is the problem is like no one's holding these people to account. No one's

1048
01:43:59.84 --> 01:44:05.12
holding their feet to the fire. No one's demanding like, Hey, you know, you, you have completely

1049
01:44:05.12 --> 01:44:10.16
discredited yourself if you're not willing to say, Hey, I was wrong. Yeah, that's like one of the

1050
01:44:10.16 --> 01:44:15.04
solowlinsky again, one of the rules and he's got a whole section that's not just one of his rules.

1051
01:44:15.04 --> 01:44:20.56
He's got a whole section on the rules of the means to an end. And it's basically, if you're

1052
01:44:20.56 --> 01:44:25.92
going to, you do whatever it takes, you do whatever it takes to get to what you want. And that's why

1053
01:44:25.92 --> 01:44:30.64
people, you know, in that situation, they go, No, I don't, I don't regret my statement because

1054
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:36.64
it's a means to an end. And they got what they wanted, which was to get a bunch of people not

1055
01:44:36.64 --> 01:44:42.80
to see information that may affect the way that they vote. And that is such a dangerous, dangerous

1056
01:44:42.80 --> 01:44:49.52
mindset, dangerous mindset where again, it's, it's so short-sighted because you know that that's

1057
01:44:49.52 --> 01:44:55.12
true. And I've talked to people personally who have said like, you know, there's they will do

1058
01:44:55.12 --> 01:44:58.80
anything and everything to pretend to prevent Donald Trump from getting elected president.

1059
01:44:59.52 --> 01:45:04.000
And he's not, he is, he is, he's very hated by, by a bunch of people.

1060
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.60
Hated as it lightly, lightly.

1061
01:45:05.60 --> 01:45:09.20
There's a level of hatred that's just, it's blinding.

1062
01:45:09.20 --> 01:45:10.24
It's blinding, right?

1063
01:45:10.24 --> 01:45:16.08
It's blinding. And that's how short-sighted that mentality is. So, you know, means to an end,

1064
01:45:16.08 --> 01:45:22.24
use whatever means available and necessary to prevent that specific outcome. Turn the tables

1065
01:45:22.24 --> 01:45:29.44
around. What about when you're on the other end of that stick and you have the opposing side saying,

1066
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:34.32
hey, now it's your side that we believe is the most dangerous thing for America.

1067
01:45:35.04 --> 01:45:39.84
We're willing to do whatever it takes to stop you or whoever your advocate or whatever,

1068
01:45:39.84 --> 01:45:46.96
whatever the case may be. That is such a dangerous mentality to have. And there are examples

1069
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:54.24
throughout history of authoritarian dictators who themselves believe like, I am the righteous one.

1070
01:45:54.24 --> 01:46:01.12
I am the savior. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes because only I know what's best for the

1071
01:46:01.12 --> 01:46:06.24
people. Are you tracking the FTX meltdown at all? The Bitcoin thing?

1072
01:46:06.24 --> 01:46:09.20
Marginally. I've read kind of the top lines on it.

1073
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:14.32
But yeah, but look, it's, I don't even know what today is. I think it's the 22nd of November.

1074
01:46:14.32 --> 01:46:23.84
But and so this case is unwinding as we speak. But right now it looks bad because these people

1075
01:46:23.84 --> 01:46:29.44
were, they set up a big Ponzi scheme for all practical purposes. And with money from that

1076
01:46:29.44 --> 01:46:36.32
Ponzi scheme, the, they were the number two donor to the Democratic Party. Right.

1077
01:46:36.32 --> 01:46:45.60
Second only to George Soros. So and, and this guy, the guy that was running it, Sam, whatever,

1078
01:46:46.64 --> 01:46:52.88
he's, he's, he's this big donor. And then they were setting him up. He was the one that was going

1079
01:46:52.88 --> 01:46:59.92
to advise the government on how they should structure regulatory environment around digital

1080
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:06.48
currency. I mean, this is, this is going to get ugly. But that's the kind of situation where

1081
01:47:06.48 --> 01:47:11.52
you're, you know, on the outside, you, if you're a normal person in America and you're working on

1082
01:47:11.52 --> 01:47:15.44
your farm or you're working in your factory or you're doing construction or whatever it is you're

1083
01:47:15.44 --> 01:47:22.72
doing, you're, you're not thinking that there's just straight doctor evil shit going on where this

1084
01:47:22.72 --> 01:47:29.28
dude's paying to have all these people elected. I mean, you don't think that $100 million has

1085
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:37.36
an impact on, on the way an election turns out. I mean, that's having a huge impact, a huge impact.

1086
01:47:37.36 --> 01:47:41.84
And so here's this guy and now he's getting, oh yeah, you donated money. So we're going to let

1087
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:48.32
you set up the regulations around cryptocurrency, which is the business that you're in, which is what,

1088
01:47:48.32 --> 01:47:52.08
and again, I'm not following the case too close. And it's really early and not a lot of it's come

1089
01:47:52.08 --> 01:48:00.80
out. But one of the other crypto dudes, CZ, some guy named CZ, he was like, oh, you're, he, uh,

1090
01:48:00.80 --> 01:48:07.12
Sam was trying to set the gig up for himself. Of course. It wasn't out of like this altruism of

1091
01:48:07.12 --> 01:48:12.72
like blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and you know, all of, you know, for people who are,

1092
01:48:12.72 --> 01:48:16.48
are big advocates of that and the opportunity they see for that in the world of technology,

1093
01:48:16.48 --> 01:48:22.24
that was not his, did not appear to be his motivation. And this dude, CZ was like, oh,

1094
01:48:22.24 --> 01:48:26.48
I see what you're trying to do. And he is the one that kind of caused this whole thing to far,

1095
01:48:26.48 --> 01:48:31.04
fall apart, which now, of course, you think, well, thankfully it fell apart when it did,

1096
01:48:31.04 --> 01:48:35.92
because it was a big house of cards anyways. But as you look at this, like I said, as a normal human

1097
01:48:35.92 --> 01:48:42.56
that lives in America, and you, you don't think that there's Dr. Evil shit going down where people

1098
01:48:42.56 --> 01:48:48.16
are buying elections, you're thinking that things are like, Hey, this is America. And the fact of

1099
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:52.72
the matter is there is this kind of thing going on. There is this massive amount of influence.

1100
01:48:52.72 --> 01:49:00.08
The big tech really is doing this kind of thing. The, the politicians really are bought. And by the way,

1101
01:49:00.80 --> 01:49:05.60
that company gave money to Republicans as well. They were hedging their bets. They should have

1102
01:49:05.60 --> 01:49:09.20
hedged their bets better with their freaking Bitcoin, by the way, because it ended up causing,

1103
01:49:09.20 --> 01:49:13.68
but they had their bets Republican and Democrat more, much more to the Democrats,

1104
01:49:13.68 --> 01:49:17.36
probably because they thought, Oh, well, Democrats are going to be in power. So we better support

1105
01:49:17.36 --> 01:49:22.96
them right now. And, and so I think that's what's really disturbing. This game is being played.

1106
01:49:23.60 --> 01:49:28.80
The surface of it, you know, we all think it's on the up and up. And as soon as you look below

1107
01:49:28.80 --> 01:49:37.04
the surface, it's dirty. And it's corrupt. And it's disgusting. Yeah. That pay to play. I mean,

1108
01:49:37.04 --> 01:49:42.88
it's, it's a perfect example of the whole pay to play mentality that that is so relevant in Washington.

1109
01:49:42.88 --> 01:49:46.08
I think last time we, I was on your show, we talked a little bit about big pharma.

1110
01:49:46.72 --> 01:49:52.48
Same thing. You look at how is it possible that, that still big pharma has so much power

1111
01:49:52.48 --> 01:49:57.76
and so much influence in Washington, they get sweet deals so that they can make more profits,

1112
01:49:57.76 --> 01:50:02.56
even when you're looking at government purchases of government of healthcare buying,

1113
01:50:02.56 --> 01:50:08.88
buying prescription drugs. They're, I think most people in society recognize that this kind of

1114
01:50:08.88 --> 01:50:15.76
outsize influence is wrong. And it's counter to the public interest. And yet many members of

1115
01:50:15.76 --> 01:50:20.32
Congress are bought off by big pharma and they won't take those votes. They won't take those

1116
01:50:20.32 --> 01:50:24.40
votes that hurt the people who give them their campaign donations and give them their campaign

1117
01:50:24.40 --> 01:50:32.64
checks. Big pharma spends more money on political contributions and lobbying than they do on those

1118
01:50:33.36 --> 01:50:39.92
crazy television ads that we see all the time of like, you know, the happy family frolicking in

1119
01:50:39.92 --> 01:50:46.32
the meadow, promoting whatever the drug may be. Side effects might be suicidal ideations,

1120
01:50:46.32 --> 01:50:53.28
massive diarrhea. And I don't think you can turn on, I don't think you can watch like one commercial

1121
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:58.64
like segment without seeing at least one prescription drug ad. And you think about the fact

1122
01:50:58.64 --> 01:51:04.16
that how like TV ads are expensive, very expensive. And then you think about, well, gosh, they're

1123
01:51:04.16 --> 01:51:10.08
spending multiple times that amount to influence, to buy influence in our government to protect

1124
01:51:10.08 --> 01:51:15.68
themselves. How does a politician put money in their own pocket from a big pharma?

1125
01:51:15.68 --> 01:51:24.16
I think there's a spectrum there. You know, those who are actually following all the laws

1126
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:30.80
make it so that those kinds of contributions make it so that they are getting the vast majority of

1127
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:36.24
the money in their political campaign, which gives them security against any potential challenger

1128
01:51:37.84 --> 01:51:43.76
are coming from these big corporations and lobbyists rather than from voters. So that's kind

1129
01:51:43.76 --> 01:51:47.04
of the first thing if you look at like, Hey, if you're following the letter of the law, even then

1130
01:51:48.08 --> 01:51:52.08
you're protecting your own self interest rather than what's the interest of the people in your

1131
01:51:52.08 --> 01:51:57.60
constituency who are actually the ones who are hiring you. You look at the most one of the most

1132
01:51:57.60 --> 01:52:04.40
egregious examples is where politicians will take money in their campaign and

1133
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:11.76
either live in the gray space of like, Oh, well, you know, and there are examples of this like,

1134
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:18.80
I'm going to use campaign money to pay for my spouse's salary because my spouse is helping

1135
01:52:18.80 --> 01:52:24.48
out on the campaign, or I'm going to use, you know, $100,000 to pay for childcare because

1136
01:52:24.48 --> 01:52:30.32
by paying for childcare, then I can go out and work on my campaign. There was somebody that I

1137
01:52:30.32 --> 01:52:37.52
worked with in Congress who used, I mean, he actually got convicted because he was breaking

1138
01:52:37.52 --> 01:52:44.96
the law, but used hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay his rent to pay for dental bills for his

1139
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:51.12
family to pay for all kinds of personal expenses. And, and, you know, still to this day, he's just

1140
01:52:51.12 --> 01:52:55.28
like, Oh, this is a witch hunt. This is, you know, they're coming after me because they don't like

1141
01:52:55.28 --> 01:53:00.08
what I'm saying. Like, no, dude, you broke the law, you know, but there's, there's a whole spectrum

1142
01:53:00.08 --> 01:53:05.60
there. I think all of which end up in a place where, you know, these are self serving interests

1143
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:09.12
rather than actually being accountable to, to your voters.

1144
01:53:10.88 --> 01:53:19.76
How do you, because I get asked this, how do you square up the distrust of the government

1145
01:53:20.48 --> 01:53:26.80
with, I'm going to serve in the armed forces? The question I get asked a lot. Yeah. And, and I

1146
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:31.28
answer it, but how, how do you answer that? You're, you're not active duty, but you're a current

1147
01:53:31.28 --> 01:53:37.44
reservist. You go on active duty on a pretty regular basis. And yet you know the, you know what,

1148
01:53:37.44 --> 01:53:44.08
how the sausage is made in Washington, DC. How do you square those two opposing things that are

1149
01:53:44.08 --> 01:53:54.08
going on? I'm proud to wear the uniform of this country and the American flag. I'm proud to

1150
01:53:54.08 --> 01:54:03.60
do my part in upholding that oath that we take when we enlist in the service. I'm honored to serve

1151
01:54:03.60 --> 01:54:12.32
with great Americans who share that same mission and those ideals. I have, because I'm in the

1152
01:54:12.32 --> 01:54:18.000
reserves and not active duty, I'm in the unique position of also being able to try to effect

1153
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:25.44
change in the political sense, recognizing we have a civilian led military in trying to lead our

1154
01:54:25.44 --> 01:54:33.28
country in the right direction to where we are honoring that vision that our founders had for

1155
01:54:33.28 --> 01:54:37.20
us, that we were honoring the service and sacrifice being made by our brothers and sisters

1156
01:54:37.20 --> 01:54:43.12
in uniform and their families. And that we are making the best decisions that serve our own

1157
01:54:43.12 --> 01:54:52.88
national security interests and the freedom and prosperity of the American people. When we have

1158
01:54:53.44 --> 01:54:58.64
people in politics who are so compromised by the military industrial complex or one interest or

1159
01:54:58.64 --> 01:55:05.04
another that is not the interests of the country and the American people, obviously those in the

1160
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:10.64
military are the ones who suffer the consequences when they make self-serving decisions.

1161
01:55:10.64 --> 01:55:18.08
Even as somebody who served in Iraq like you, whether we agree or disagree with those decisions

1162
01:55:18.08 --> 01:55:25.44
that are made by those civilians in leadership, it does not undermine the promise that we make

1163
01:55:25.44 --> 01:55:32.88
to each other and to the Constitution as we continue to fulfill that promise.

1164
01:55:32.88 --> 01:55:42.64
Yeah, obviously for me besides the just freaking awesome job that it is being in the military,

1165
01:55:42.64 --> 01:55:49.84
which I loved being in the military, but when you're in the military, you have an opportunity to

1166
01:55:49.84 --> 01:55:56.32
sort of mitigate the bad decisions that get made and you also get the opportunity to shape the

1167
01:55:56.32 --> 01:56:03.20
military itself. So when you're in the military, you can do a much better job of taking people and

1168
01:56:03.92 --> 01:56:09.76
like getting people the right mindset that's going to be beneficial for the country and for

1169
01:56:09.76 --> 01:56:14.72
whatever country we're going into as opposed to if you're not in the military and you're sitting on

1170
01:56:14.72 --> 01:56:18.32
the outside saying, well, it should be like this. Well, if you're in the military, you can actually

1171
01:56:18.32 --> 01:56:23.52
make some of those things happen and you can do it within the guidelines that are set forth by the

1172
01:56:23.52 --> 01:56:28.88
military, but you can do it in a positive way. So I guess that's how I always tried to square

1173
01:56:28.88 --> 01:56:36.000
myself. It's so true. It's so true. And right now, I'm grateful to I often have the opportunity to go

1174
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.92
and provide in the Army, they call it LPD. It's like leadership professional development

1175
01:56:40.80 --> 01:56:46.40
sessions with either soldiers who are going through training pipelines or those who are out in the

1176
01:56:46.40 --> 01:56:56.08
force for exactly that purpose to hopefully have an impact in helping make sure that we have discerning

1177
01:56:56.08 --> 01:57:01.76
leaders in the military, not just robots who aren't actually thinking through the kind of

1178
01:57:01.76 --> 01:57:07.44
responsibility that they have, regardless of their rank as they're carrying out their task

1179
01:57:07.44 --> 01:57:12.64
and their mission. The other cool thing for you is you being able to explain to leaders in the

1180
01:57:12.64 --> 01:57:16.96
military, hey, this is what it looks like from the governmental side. You should probably go

1181
01:57:16.96 --> 01:57:21.28
brief every military, you know, what's going on with that. Because I mean, even when I was in,

1182
01:57:21.28 --> 01:57:26.24
I would kind of get trying grasp that and try and explain to people, hey, this is what it looks

1183
01:57:26.24 --> 01:57:31.60
like from a political perspective. But for you, that's, that's you have the real experience to

1184
01:57:31.60 --> 01:57:35.76
say, hey, this is why we're getting asked to do this. This is what it looks like. Here's what it

1185
01:57:35.76 --> 01:57:40.80
took to get this decision made. Here's why we need to execute it. Here's what happens if we don't.

1186
01:57:40.80 --> 01:57:45.92
So that's, it's pretty. It is. And, and, you know, I've had the opportunity to work a lot

1187
01:57:45.92 --> 01:57:50.24
within the special operations community, particularly because they are looking for this

1188
01:57:50.24 --> 01:57:54.88
kind of insight. And one thing I've really appreciated, especially in the special operations

1189
01:57:54.88 --> 01:57:59.52
community versus the conventional military, which is not where it's not really encouraged so much,

1190
01:57:59.52 --> 01:58:05.52
but really that problem solving mindset, a little bit of that challenging mindset where,

1191
01:58:05.52 --> 01:58:10.80
you know, being a robot is discouraged. You are actually encouraged and incentivized to be somebody

1192
01:58:10.80 --> 01:58:15.04
who's like, Hey, how can we do this better? Or why is this actually the best way? Or how was this

1193
01:58:15.04 --> 01:58:21.36
decision made, whether you're an NCO or an officer? And I just having that encouraging that critical

1194
01:58:21.36 --> 01:58:26.48
thinking and recognizing again, the impact that you have on people is, is so important. And I

1195
01:58:26.48 --> 01:58:30.88
wish it was something that was more encouraged across the military as a whole.

1196
01:58:30.88 --> 01:58:35.76
What are you right now, a Lieutenant Colonel? Yeah.

1197
01:58:35.76 --> 01:58:40.48
When do you up for Colonel, Full Bird Colonel?

1198
01:58:40.48 --> 01:58:45.20
I think the window opens maybe in about a year or two.

1199
01:58:47.36 --> 01:58:54.16
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure, but we'll see that the results of the command board are supposed to

1200
01:58:54.16 --> 01:59:00.16
come out any day now. And if I have, if I have, I'll find out if I have the privilege of being

1201
01:59:00.16 --> 01:59:04.000
selected to be a battalion commander for a civil affairs reserve battalion.

1202
01:59:04.64 --> 01:59:07.92
What are your chances? Is it like, how hard is it to get selected for that?

1203
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:14.24
It all depends on in the reserves. It's a little bit different than the active duty where,

1204
01:59:15.28 --> 01:59:18.56
obviously you've got to be able to balance your time with whatever your civilian job or

1205
01:59:18.56 --> 01:59:23.20
profession might be with, with the responsibilities of being a battalion commander.

1206
01:59:24.32 --> 01:59:29.04
So it kind of depends on how many people are opting in or out on any given year.

1207
01:59:29.04 --> 01:59:32.40
But there's a lot more. It is competitive. It is competitive.

1208
01:59:32.40 --> 01:59:35.20
So if you get picked up as a reservist battalion commander,

1209
01:59:36.24 --> 01:59:42.24
how much time do you have to spend active as a battalion commander? Do you have to do more?

1210
01:59:42.24 --> 01:59:49.28
On paper, you have the same minimum requirement of the one weekend a month, two weeks a year.

1211
01:59:49.28 --> 01:59:53.60
But a friend of mine was selected last year. He's a little bit ahead of me.

1212
01:59:53.60 --> 01:59:59.12
And there's a lot of love time, as we say, there's a lot of love time.

1213
01:59:59.76 --> 02:00:04.64
Because in a reserve unit, you rely a lot on your full-time staff, the full-time reservists who are

1214
02:00:05.20 --> 02:00:09.76
running the staff shops, the personnel shop, the operation shop, and supply and everything else.

1215
02:00:10.40 --> 02:00:16.24
And he's going to give me his best practices because he's just like, yeah, he runs his own

1216
02:00:16.24 --> 02:00:21.52
business. It's kind of, and his business is doing very well. He has different projects around the

1217
02:00:21.52 --> 02:00:26.96
world. And he's also a reserve battalion commander. And he's just like, yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot.

1218
02:00:26.96 --> 02:00:36.000
But it's freaking awesome. Yeah. And so other than that, what else you got going on right now?

1219
02:00:39.36 --> 02:00:44.08
What else are we doing? You got the Tulsi Gabbard show, which you finally launched.

1220
02:00:44.08 --> 02:00:47.84
I know. It took forever. You came and talked to Echo and I about that. I think that's why you

1221
02:00:47.84 --> 02:00:55.20
stopped by. You came by to suck our brains on how to do a podcast. And Echo decided to give you

1222
02:00:55.20 --> 02:01:04.40
all of his advice. Yeah. I took notes. We took all of the advice. After that, I ended up getting

1223
02:01:04.40 --> 02:01:09.36
deployed to East Africa and was gone for a while and then came back and just, you know, a lot of

1224
02:01:09.36 --> 02:01:16.56
things happened. But yeah, finally pushed it out. And it's just, you know, I mean, it's such a great

1225
02:01:16.56 --> 02:01:22.32
opportunity and platform to be able to dive into, you know, different issues, different topics,

1226
02:01:22.32 --> 02:01:29.04
have great conversations. And so, you know, where people like, you know, like the guy in the, you

1227
02:01:29.04 --> 02:01:32.96
know, the coffee shop in Greensboro, he's like, Oh my God, why don't you leave a different kind of,

1228
02:01:32.96 --> 02:01:38.32
oh, okay, go listen. This episode one will tell you exactly the answer to what you're looking for.

1229
02:01:38.32 --> 02:01:40.40
How often are you doing the podcast? Come out once a week?

1230
02:01:40.40 --> 02:01:43.44
Once a week, every Tuesday. Push out a new episode every Tuesday.

1231
02:01:43.44 --> 02:01:50.32
And where are you recording them? Wherever? I am for the most part recording at home in Hawaii.

1232
02:01:51.04 --> 02:01:56.96
We got rid of a living room. We lived in a tiny two bedroom place and decided that having a studio

1233
02:01:56.96 --> 02:02:02.40
was more practical than having a living room. Literally, we're like, if we're just sitting

1234
02:02:02.40 --> 02:02:07.28
around on the couch, we're not, we're not using our time very well. So we got rid of the couch and

1235
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.16
my husband's a cinematographer. So he put together a studio. And so I'm sure there will be on the

1236
02:02:12.16 --> 02:02:17.92
road ones at different points, but so far doing them from home. And then what do you have a

1237
02:02:17.92 --> 02:02:23.76
sub stack? Did I see that? Yeah. So just recognize, you know, like my whole approach is there's so

1238
02:02:23.76 --> 02:02:28.72
many different platforms that people get information from. And some people like to listen to podcasts.

1239
02:02:28.72 --> 02:02:32.88
Other people don't like podcasts and they, they would rather watch cable news and other people

1240
02:02:32.88 --> 02:02:39.36
don't like any of that and would rather read. And so for each of the episodes at a minimum for each

1241
02:02:39.36 --> 02:02:44.56
of the podcasts that I'm putting out that I'm talking about a different issue, I jot down

1242
02:02:44.56 --> 02:02:49.84
my notes and put them out on sub stack for people who just want to get a little bit of a summary

1243
02:02:50.80 --> 02:02:56.48
of where I stand on certain things or my thoughts or views on, on a, something that might be

1244
02:02:56.48 --> 02:03:01.12
happening in the news or something like that. And then YouTube, you're on YouTube. We're on

1245
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:09.76
YouTube on rumble and, and you're, oh yeah, no, you're on rumble rumble. Echo Charles. What's up? Oh,

1246
02:03:09.76 --> 02:03:14.96
we're on rumble. Wait, you think we're on rumble? Cause I know I talked about getting us on rumble.

1247
02:03:14.96 --> 02:03:19.84
Yeah. Oh, I can think of some matter of how many episodes are on rumble. Okay. So we're kind of on

1248
02:03:19.84 --> 02:03:24.08
rumble. Let me double check that for a minute. Okay. I appreciate that one. Circle back.

1249
02:03:24.08 --> 02:03:31.84
He'll say that. And then you're doing some spots on Fox news. You sat in for Tucker, Tucker

1250
02:03:31.84 --> 02:03:39.20
Carlson the other night. Yeah. Second time he hour, he or his team asked for me to, to guest

1251
02:03:39.20 --> 02:03:46.24
host for him when he was off. And that, that man, that's a new experience. I've never done that before

1252
02:03:46.24 --> 02:03:54.48
anywhere else. And, um, hosting an hour, 44 minutes when you count in, you know, commercials

1253
02:03:54.48 --> 02:03:59.60
of live television is definitely a new experience. A different level of like,

1254
02:04:00.64 --> 02:04:05.68
there ain't no room for mistakes. It's a thing. It's a thing that, it's a thing that people have.

1255
02:04:05.68 --> 02:04:12.24
Some people are good at it. Like when you, when you go and you see what the, what the news,

1256
02:04:12.24 --> 02:04:16.32
what are they called? Newscasters, broadcasters. What are they called? Hosts. What are they called?

1257
02:04:16.96 --> 02:04:22.80
Yeah. He would be a host because, you know, he's more on the opinion side of things than like

1258
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:27.84
your, your Brett bear on Fox is a little bit more of like a news kind of more of a straight news guy.

1259
02:04:27.84 --> 02:04:34.08
When you see what that job, I would not like that job. Yeah. Do you like it? I had a lot more

1260
02:04:34.08 --> 02:04:38.56
fun than I expected to have, to be honest. I, it was, it was certainly a lot of, because, you know,

1261
02:04:38.56 --> 02:04:43.84
you know, his show is on every night and obviously Tucker's been doing this forever and he's,

1262
02:04:43.84 --> 02:04:50.24
he's, you know, good at it. I'd say, I mean, he has the top rated show on Fox news. And so,

1263
02:04:51.52 --> 02:04:57.68
you know, for me going in, I sometimes they have guest hosts who literally just show up and then

1264
02:04:57.68 --> 02:05:05.12
they get given the whatever's going to be on the teleprompter. I'm not, I don't, I wouldn't do that

1265
02:05:05.12 --> 02:05:10.88
for anybody. If I'm reading words on a teleprompter, they're going to be words that I wrote. And so,

1266
02:05:10.88 --> 02:05:17.84
working with his team to write and structure the show, you know, all within the span of like

1267
02:05:17.84 --> 02:05:26.40
a six hour timeframe, it's a lot, it's a lot. And, but it's, look, I mean, I actually did end up having,

1268
02:05:26.40 --> 02:05:32.08
having fun just, just taking advantage of the opportunity to be able to share my own views

1269
02:05:32.08 --> 02:05:37.04
on what's happening and have conversations with people. It is challenging and like, okay, you

1270
02:05:37.04 --> 02:05:42.000
get four minutes to talk to somebody and you got somebody in your ear. Like literally, like I asked

1271
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:48.40
the first question, the producers like, okay, you have 90 seconds. Like, okay, rap, rap, rap. And I'm

1272
02:05:48.40 --> 02:05:53.20
like, Oh my God, like I would love to either challenge what they're saying or ask another

1273
02:05:53.20 --> 02:05:58.24
follow up or whatever. And it is the weirdest me and my buddy, Leif, who I wrote books with.

1274
02:05:58.24 --> 02:06:05.60
And when his wife worked at Fox News and Jenna Lee. And so I would, when I would go to New York,

1275
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:11.28
you know, a lot of times I would just stay with them. And so I would kind of see her schedule

1276
02:06:11.28 --> 02:06:18.56
and life. And I was like, Oh my God, it's grueling. It's grueling. I didn't want anything to do with

1277
02:06:18.56 --> 02:06:25.20
that. So even the one hour session one, now I guess you're going to get good. A person would get

1278
02:06:25.20 --> 02:06:28.64
better at it, you know, and you could see that Jenna, she was totally comfortable with it. I mean,

1279
02:06:28.64 --> 02:06:31.52
it's just the way it is. It's just like anything. Yeah. Just like anything else. You're gonna get

1280
02:06:31.52 --> 02:06:36.56
used to it. But that's a, you know, have you ever been on Maria's show? Maria Bartolomou?

1281
02:06:36.56 --> 02:06:41.60
I have. Yeah. That, that I was so impressed with that woman when I've gone on her show, gone on

1282
02:06:41.60 --> 02:06:48.32
her show a number of times. And she's just, she's got to be so smart. Yeah. I would sit there though.

1283
02:06:48.32 --> 02:06:51.60
Because you know, you're watching her beforehand, you're watching her in between. Because like you

1284
02:06:51.60 --> 02:06:55.28
said, in between, they're like, Hey, we got this one. And here's these numbers. And then like,

1285
02:06:55.28 --> 02:06:58.80
boom, the camera goes back on, the red light comes on and she's all just squared away with

1286
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:02.72
everything she's saying. Yeah. It's pretty, it's a different kind of human. You can tell

1287
02:07:02.72 --> 02:07:07.28
the skill. I guess there's a certain, you know, like Michael Jordan is going to be good at basketball.

1288
02:07:07.28 --> 02:07:11.52
There's a certain type of human being that's going to be good at that job. Yeah. You've got to be,

1289
02:07:12.72 --> 02:07:18.72
I mean, obviously you've got to be very focused and you've got to be able to discern kind of the,

1290
02:07:18.72 --> 02:07:23.36
of all of the, the activity and voice in your ears and everything else that's going on. You got to

1291
02:07:23.36 --> 02:07:31.60
be able to separate kind of the noise from the task at hand and not allow yourself to be shaken

1292
02:07:31.60 --> 02:07:38.08
or distracted by whatever is going on around you. And that's, that's part of it. So are you going

1293
02:07:38.08 --> 02:07:45.68
to do it more? We'll see. They say they, they've been pretty happy with it. And so they're saying

1294
02:07:45.68 --> 02:07:50.88
like, okay, well, we look forward to having you do it more often. We used to catch a lot of crap for

1295
02:07:50.88 --> 02:07:58.16
going on Fox news. Like it was, I, even I have, because I've got, I go on Fox news, I still go

1296
02:07:58.16 --> 02:08:05.84
on Fox news. You know, many times CNN has asked me to be on CNN zero zero zero. Yeah.

1297
02:08:05.84 --> 02:08:12.96
Yeah. Same thing with any other Fox news. MSNBC. MSNBC. They don't ask me to come on and talk to

1298
02:08:12.96 --> 02:08:18.000
them. Yeah. That's, but you, I mean, I guess, the same thing. Yeah. It's the same thing. You know,

1299
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.04
it, it towards the end of my, well, first of all, like throughout the entire time that I was in

1300
02:08:23.04 --> 02:08:30.08
Congress, you know, I, I was asked on all, all three of the different networks over the years,

1301
02:08:30.96 --> 02:08:37.36
the invitations have shifted and changed based on whatever I was advocating for. If like CNN

1302
02:08:37.36 --> 02:08:43.12
wasn't really going after it, then like, Oh, I wonder why I don't hear from this show or that

1303
02:08:43.12 --> 02:08:48.48
show that literally happened to you. Literally. And noticeably, when you first showed up as a

1304
02:08:48.48 --> 02:08:54.80
Congresswoman, you were kind of like a little bit of a kind of a rising star, right? So they say,

1305
02:08:54.80 --> 02:08:58.96
so you were a rising star. Were you just, were they calling you all the time? All the time. And I

1306
02:08:58.96 --> 02:09:05.92
just like, I was just, you know, over the years, people are like, Oh, you know, who's your publicist?

1307
02:09:05.92 --> 02:09:11.44
Who's doing all this? I was like, my phone's just ringing. I don't have a publicist. I have somebody

1308
02:09:11.44 --> 02:09:17.20
who used to be like a communications intern who's answering the phone calls, but it was very, very

1309
02:09:17.20 --> 02:09:22.56
unexpected. And I was just like, okay, like I'll take advantage. Like if it makes sense, then I'll

1310
02:09:22.56 --> 02:09:29.28
take advantage of this platform to be able to say what I want to say. But it was a palpable shift

1311
02:09:29.28 --> 02:09:36.40
over the years as, you know, I would, I would speak out on a certain issue or, you know, I didn't

1312
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:42.48
support Hillary Clinton in 2016. And that was like, Oh, okay. Well, it was literally considered

1313
02:09:42.48 --> 02:09:47.84
blasphemy and politics. And then again, in, in 2020, when I ran for president,

1314
02:09:50.32 --> 02:09:57.52
it was, you know, I saw this shift just throughout that campaign, where there was already a negative

1315
02:09:57.52 --> 02:10:03.68
bias towards me from the day that I announced my candidacy, because I had a track record of being

1316
02:10:03.68 --> 02:10:09.68
somebody who called it straight and was very outspoken against the foreign policy establishment

1317
02:10:09.68 --> 02:10:16.000
in Washington and their decisions. And that, that progressed throughout the campaign where it got to

1318
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.52
a point where instead of even covering me or instead of mentioning, Hey, this person is a

1319
02:10:21.52 --> 02:10:25.52
candidate for president, they just stopped including my name and articles about Democrats

1320
02:10:25.52 --> 02:10:30.08
running for president completely as though I didn't exist. It was a media blackout at a certain

1321
02:10:30.08 --> 02:10:38.16
point throughout the time. Fox News consistently has been a platform where I've been invited on

1322
02:10:38.16 --> 02:10:43.20
consistently. Did they invite you to talk about issues that you weren't disagreement with them?

1323
02:10:43.84 --> 02:10:47.44
Yeah. Yeah. Over the years. They just didn't care. And they didn't care. And one thing that,

1324
02:10:47.44 --> 02:10:52.32
that I've heard from different hosts of different shows, and even some of the, you know, like the

1325
02:10:52.32 --> 02:10:56.40
executives at Fox is like, Tulsa, we really like having you on because we never know what you're

1326
02:10:56.40 --> 02:11:03.04
going to say. Literally. You are unpredictable. And, and that's why our audience likes you.

1327
02:11:03.04 --> 02:11:06.80
Because you're, you're interesting person. You have something interesting to say that's not just

1328
02:11:06.80 --> 02:11:13.12
like one party's talking points or, you know, whatever the popular thing is of the day. And I

1329
02:11:13.12 --> 02:11:19.12
think that, that says something about media as a whole. But the fact that they, they just say,

1330
02:11:19.12 --> 02:11:22.96
come on and say your piece. I go on and say my piece, whether the host degrees or disagrees,

1331
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:27.60
maybe that's part of the conversation, but it's not, it's not the deciding factor of, of whether

1332
02:11:27.60 --> 02:11:32.32
they have me on or not. But the other news networks, it was a deciding factor. Oh, absolutely. I mean,

1333
02:11:32.32 --> 02:11:35.84
I, and that's the people on social media like, Oh, how come you're always on Fox News? You know,

1334
02:11:35.84 --> 02:11:39.60
you're letting them take advantage of you and all this other stuff. It's like, no, I'm taking advantage

1335
02:11:39.60 --> 02:11:44.48
of the platform. Number one, because they reach millions of people more than any other cable news

1336
02:11:44.48 --> 02:11:50.56
network. And number two, CNN and MSNBC, they don't, they, they haven't asked me on their air for years

1337
02:11:51.20 --> 02:11:55.84
on any issue. Like Eve, I've reached out once on veterans issues, toxic burn pits, things,

1338
02:11:55.84 --> 02:12:00.64
things that I've worked on in Congress and still really passionate about and trying to advance.

1339
02:12:01.36 --> 02:12:09.12
No interest whatsoever. That's like kind of crazy, isn't it? Yeah, it's very revealing,

1340
02:12:09.76 --> 02:12:14.000
very revealing. So you would reach out to CNN and say, Hey, I would like to talk to you about

1341
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:18.24
the veterans that have been around these toxic burn pits and now they've got diseases.

1342
02:12:18.24 --> 02:12:20.24
Would you like to do this? I think they'd be like, no,

1343
02:12:21.44 --> 02:12:25.04
the response I got back, and this was the, that was the last time I reached out. The response I

1344
02:12:25.04 --> 02:12:30.80
got back was like, Oh, interesting. Let me check with the producers and then radio silence. Like

1345
02:12:30.80 --> 02:12:34.80
they didn't, they didn't have the balls to come back and say like, yeah, no, thanks. Not interested.

1346
02:12:34.80 --> 02:12:42.72
It was just like no response. Well, you have your own platform now, right? You got the, the podcast,

1347
02:12:42.72 --> 02:12:51.04
the YouTube channel, the, the sub stack thing going on. TulsiGabber.com. You're on there.

1348
02:12:51.04 --> 02:13:00.16
TulsiGabber.com. I'm working on a book right now as well. Two books actually focused on

1349
02:13:01.60 --> 02:13:05.44
While of the Democratic Party and the other book focused on the cost of war.

1350
02:13:05.44 --> 02:13:09.92
Or do you already have a publisher for these? I do. Sweet. And so when are these things coming

1351
02:13:09.92 --> 02:13:18.08
out? Working on the sequencing. But I hope to have one of the books out by, I don't know,

1352
02:13:18.08 --> 02:13:25.60
early next year, spring. What about politics in your future? I don't know. I don't know,

1353
02:13:25.60 --> 02:13:36.08
is the honest answer. It's, I want to be in a position where I can best make a positive impact

1354
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:44.64
and where I feel I can best serve. I am terribly concerned for all of the reasons that we've talked

1355
02:13:44.64 --> 02:13:51.52
about today about the failure. It's not even a lack of leadership. It's, it's, it's a sincere failure

1356
02:13:51.52 --> 02:14:04.96
of leadership in this country. And if there is a way for me to actually directly impact that

1357
02:14:04.96 --> 02:14:13.76
leadership, then I will pursue that, whether that means I'm running for office or trying to impact

1358
02:14:13.76 --> 02:14:22.96
those who are in office. We'll see. The vehicle is, is less important than the impact to me.

1359
02:14:25.04 --> 02:14:28.48
But you may go back into politics? Sure.

1360
02:14:28.48 --> 02:14:36.24
All right. What is it? Echo? Yes. What do you got? Anything else?

1361
02:14:36.24 --> 02:14:40.000
No, I was going to ask that. You will be running for anything or, you know, thinking about it or

1362
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.20
what? But, you know, we got that answer. We're still surfing, obviously. Yes. Water woman never

1363
02:14:45.20 --> 02:14:52.80
died. But no, water woman is alive as well. A lot lately. A lot. I've been on the road in the last

1364
02:14:52.80 --> 02:14:59.04
two months. I've probably been home, I don't know, two weeks out of that period of time.

1365
02:14:59.04 --> 02:15:05.28
You spend a lot of time campaigning for people too. Yes. Which was, you know, after I announced

1366
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:11.12
that I was leaving the Democratic Party, becoming an independent, my phone started ringing off the

1367
02:15:11.12 --> 02:15:16.16
hook from people in what, you know, what they call the swing states, the states that can either go

1368
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:24.24
Democrat or Republican, a lot of close races and people inviting me to come out and help campaign

1369
02:15:24.24 --> 02:15:29.76
for them, recognizing that there are a lot of undecided people, whether they're independents

1370
02:15:29.76 --> 02:15:34.40
or Democrats or Republicans who are frustrated with the current state of affairs and current

1371
02:15:34.40 --> 02:15:40.88
leadership. And so, yeah, I reached out to you mostly. Democrats or Republicans? Republicans.

1372
02:15:40.88 --> 02:15:46.88
Did any Democrats reach out to you? No. If they had, if there were, if there were a Democrat

1373
02:15:46.88 --> 02:15:53.60
running for Congress who was openly calling out the insanity of the Democrat leadership of today

1374
02:15:54.56 --> 02:16:00.40
and taking a strong stand on the things we're talking about, on basic fundamentals of freedom,

1375
02:16:00.40 --> 02:16:06.16
I would have happily gone and campaigned for them. Not a single one reached out. And I've been looking.

1376
02:16:06.16 --> 02:16:12.000
I've been looking for those courageous voices to actually step out. And unfortunately,

1377
02:16:14.72 --> 02:16:23.20
that hasn't been there. And I've heard from some people privately, just and really over the last

1378
02:16:23.20 --> 02:16:29.12
few years who are saying, hey, thank you so much for speaking out on these things. I appreciate

1379
02:16:29.12 --> 02:16:36.08
what you're doing, but also don't tell anyone. And so it's sad, it's unfortunate, but part of

1380
02:16:36.08 --> 02:16:41.44
like the last thing I said in my announcement of leading the Democratic Party is I invite other

1381
02:16:41.44 --> 02:16:56.56
Democrats to join me. Has anyone? Not yet. Not yet. All right. So I guess we should real quick

1382
02:16:56.56 --> 02:17:00.40
talk about supporting this podcast. Of course, you're going to support Tosca's podcast, but if

1383
02:17:00.40 --> 02:17:05.12
you want to support this podcast, you want to support America and you want to support yourself,

1384
02:17:05.12 --> 02:17:08.72
you can. You can do it. We got a bunch of different ways for you to do it. How has your

1385
02:17:09.68 --> 02:17:15.36
energy drink been? Love it. So you immediately went for a mango flavor, which is the,

1386
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.08
I mean, is it safe to say this is more of a Hawaiian vibe? Yeah, especially with the lily

1387
02:17:20.08 --> 02:17:26.24
quay in there. A passion fruit. Okay. So we got a little bit of that going on. You can get this stuff

1388
02:17:27.04 --> 02:17:32.24
from DrFuel.com. You can get it at Wawa. You can get it at Vitamin Shop. You can get it. We're

1389
02:17:32.24 --> 02:17:37.76
in all military commissaries. I've noticed that. I was in the commissary at Kanyoya Marine Corp.

1390
02:17:39.52 --> 02:17:46.08
Week and a half ago, and I almost took a picture. I was like, Hey, we're about to be in the exchanges

1391
02:17:46.08 --> 02:17:51.20
too, which is cool. Cause if you're in the military, you know, the commissaries basically

1392
02:17:51.20 --> 02:17:56.16
families go to commissaries. Like the young enlisted guys, they're not going to the commissary. It

1393
02:17:56.16 --> 02:18:00.16
takes too much time or whatever, but they go to the exchange exchange, you know, they sell gas and

1394
02:18:00.16 --> 02:18:05.76
whatever beer. So now you can get some jockel fuel. You will be able to in the very near future.

1395
02:18:08.64 --> 02:18:17.12
Is there a red taped process to get into like a store? There is. So like, I was at a shop,

1396
02:18:18.32 --> 02:18:22.80
the other, I don't know, Wico or whatever. And they're like, Hey, bring those energy drinks

1397
02:18:22.80 --> 02:18:26.48
we want to sell them or whatever. I can't just be like, Oh, I got something at home and bring them.

1398
02:18:26.48 --> 02:18:31.44
Right. Or can wait, which store was it? Like a local? Yeah. Yeah. San Diego disc.

1399
02:18:33.44 --> 02:18:38.32
Yeah. We just, we dig, we dig a wholesale. So if anybody wants to do wholesale, this is like,

1400
02:18:38.32 --> 02:18:44.72
if you got a store, you got a gym, you got a jiu-jitsu academy, you can go to J F sales

1401
02:18:45.36 --> 02:18:49.12
at jockel fuel.com and email that and you get a wholesale account set up and, and that,

1402
02:18:49.76 --> 02:18:54.64
then you can do it. Okay. So that's more for the store really. Right. Yeah. The

1403
02:18:54.64 --> 02:18:58.72
the, uh, yeah, a little bit, but not really. I mean, when somebody wants to bring something

1404
02:18:58.72 --> 02:19:02.40
into their store, they can just get a wholesale account and set up. Now, if they have a big chain

1405
02:19:02.40 --> 02:19:06.24
store, that's where it run. That's where you run into. And at some point, I got to do some kind

1406
02:19:06.24 --> 02:19:13.84
of a podcast about what it goes on. That'd be interesting because for instance, we're, so

1407
02:19:14.56 --> 02:19:20.56
it's kind of cool. It's kind of complimentary when you start making a dent. All of a sudden,

1408
02:19:20.56 --> 02:19:25.44
the big, the big giant billion dollar corporations realized that you're making a dent and they

1409
02:19:25.44 --> 02:19:31.04
come after you. So for instance, I don't know how much I can say about this, but I'll say a little

1410
02:19:31.04 --> 02:19:38.000
bit, uh, in one particular store that we're in, one of the big companies came in and paid millions

1411
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:46.000
of dollars, millions of dollars for our slots in, in this particular store and like slots,

1412
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.80
meaning room on the shelf, room on the shelf. Interesting. They said,

1413
02:19:48.80 --> 02:19:53.68
we really don't want Jocko Fuel to be out there. We don't, we see what they're doing.

1414
02:19:53.68 --> 02:19:58.56
We see their growth. We don't like it. We have to go on the offense. And so they paid millions and

1415
02:19:58.56 --> 02:20:04.96
millions of dollars to take our shelf space from us. And, and, and I can't even be mad at the store

1416
02:20:04.96 --> 02:20:08.08
because the store is trying to make profit and they're trying to do what they're doing.

1417
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:12.48
And they also have to keep a relationship with the big giant companies. Otherwise,

1418
02:20:12.48 --> 02:20:17.36
they won't be able to supply things that those big giant companies put out there. So

1419
02:20:17.36 --> 02:20:22.48
that's what happens. That's the fight we're in right now. It's kind of cool because it means

1420
02:20:22.48 --> 02:20:27.36
you're, you're, you're, you're growing to a point where, and people, the weird thing is people kind

1421
02:20:27.36 --> 02:20:33.84
of all these big companies. And when I say big companies, I'm not men singing. I'm talking about

1422
02:20:33.84 --> 02:20:39.52
the biggest companies there are. They know what we're doing. They're, they're now taking active

1423
02:20:39.52 --> 02:20:45.60
countermeasures to try and shut us down because they know that kind of on a, on a product,

1424
02:20:45.60 --> 02:20:51.68
we, they can't beat us because we held the line. We're making it good for you. We're doing all

1425
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:56.72
these things that they're not going to do. They would rather sacrifice millions of dollars to

1426
02:20:56.72 --> 02:21:02.96
buy that shelf space than pay, create a better product. So that says a lot about competition.

1427
02:21:02.96 --> 02:21:09.36
That's what we're up against. And cool, like this is it. This is what we're doing. And we're going

1428
02:21:09.36 --> 02:21:16.80
to have some setbacks like that. But the cool thing is the product is better. We know it's

1429
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:20.64
better. They know it's better. Otherwise they would just go toe to toe, right? It's be like,

1430
02:21:20.64 --> 02:21:25.28
cool, let's do this, but they don't want to do that. Man, there, there are some interesting

1431
02:21:25.28 --> 02:21:32.32
parallels to what we were talking about, about substance versus trying to silence or push out

1432
02:21:32.32 --> 02:21:37.52
anybody who has a counter. Yeah. Same. I mean, you're seeing it play out. Seeing it play out.

1433
02:21:37.52 --> 02:21:44.32
And, but it is crazy. And that's why big corporations with billy, with a B billions of

1434
02:21:44.32 --> 02:21:52.08
dollars, they do their best to destroy the smaller companies that are growing. And that's the way

1435
02:21:52.08 --> 02:21:56.08
it is. And we'll see how it plays out. I can tell you how it's playing out right now. It's playing

1436
02:21:56.08 --> 02:22:01.28
out good because we're going to continue to make the best product. We're going to continue to grow.

1437
02:22:01.28 --> 02:22:07.84
And we, and the cool thing is the demand signal, the demand signal. That's what like in this particular

1438
02:22:07.84 --> 02:22:13.44
store that I'm talking about. And it's a, it's a whole group of stores, but they, they took some

1439
02:22:13.44 --> 02:22:19.28
slots, the big billion dollar corporation took some slots, but the store wouldn't give up all of

1440
02:22:19.28 --> 02:22:22.88
them. They took some, but they said, Hey man, people are in here every day for that dock of fuel.

1441
02:22:22.88 --> 02:22:26.24
We're not giving this up. We're not taking this away from our customers. Yeah. We can't just

1442
02:22:26.24 --> 02:22:31.52
screw over our customers. We can screw them over a little bit, but we can't screw them all the way

1443
02:22:31.52 --> 02:22:37.04
over. So they kept a bunch of, a bunch of our product in the store, but not as much as we wanted,

1444
02:22:37.04 --> 02:22:44.32
but it's fine. It's fine. So if you want to support America and you want to support the growing

1445
02:22:44.32 --> 02:22:48.96
companies, you want to support people that are growing things in America, then jocofuel.com.

1446
02:22:48.96 --> 02:22:53.04
It's the same thing with origin USA, origin USA.com. And by the way, next time you're in North

1447
02:22:53.04 --> 02:22:57.68
Carolina, you got to go to our factory. I know. I've been talking to Pete and I think we, we

1448
02:22:57.68 --> 02:23:01.76
may have something planned in December. We'll see. Good. Origin. I was supposed to go down there.

1449
02:23:01.76 --> 02:23:04.72
I was supposed to go to the North Carolina factory for veterans day. I said, I went to the main

1450
02:23:04.72 --> 02:23:08.88
factory because there was a freaking hurricane hitting North Carolina. So I couldn't go down

1451
02:23:08.88 --> 02:23:14.48
there. But yeah, next time you're down there, it's the same thing. The billion dollar corporations

1452
02:23:14.48 --> 02:23:21.60
see what we're doing. The weird thing is they, they're, they saw what we were doing and like

1453
02:23:21.60 --> 02:23:29.52
before we were even doing very much, they were threatened. And I think it's, I think it's because

1454
02:23:29.52 --> 02:23:33.84
the truth is so threatening. And when you have someone that's like, no, actually, you can't

1455
02:23:33.84 --> 02:23:37.28
build this stuff in America. And when for years they say, you can't do it, you can't do it, you

1456
02:23:37.28 --> 02:23:42.000
can't, they're, they're, they're lying. And so now there's someone saying, oh yeah, look at this

1457
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:48.48
over here. Look what we're actually doing right now, 100% America. Look, and they, they are scared.

1458
02:23:48.48 --> 02:23:54.88
And so since day one, they've been onto us. The, the, the food companies, they're kind of taking

1459
02:23:54.88 --> 02:24:02.000
notice in the last six months where they're like, oh, shit. The, the clothing companies,

1460
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.56
they've been honest because they're scared because we're doing everything right and they're doing

1461
02:24:06.56 --> 02:24:10.80
everything wrong. And that's just all there is to it. I think they recognize too, kind of the

1462
02:24:10.80 --> 02:24:16.000
difference between the, you know, the fast fashion, just buying like the cheap stuff, use it a few

1463
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.68
times and throw it away versus the conscious choice that I think a lot of people are starting to make

1464
02:24:21.68 --> 02:24:29.20
is like, okay, I might pay a few more dollars, but I will take pride in knowing that in Origins case,

1465
02:24:29.20 --> 02:24:35.28
from the cotton that's grown to the final hands that are putting those jeans in a bag,

1466
02:24:36.40 --> 02:24:42.56
these were American hands that, and hard work and sweat that went into creating this. And I will

1467
02:24:42.56 --> 02:24:50.32
wear this with pride. Yeah. And by the way, that hard work, these are people that have mortgages

1468
02:24:50.32 --> 02:24:55.36
that are learning like we got kids, I shouldn't call them kids, but you know, people that are

1469
02:24:55.36 --> 02:25:01.28
23 years old, 22 years old, that now have a skill that they have a career now, whether it's running

1470
02:25:01.28 --> 02:25:07.36
a loom, whether it's running a press, whatever skill they're getting, they're getting a skill that

1471
02:25:07.36 --> 02:25:11.60
they can now have a, they have a real job, they have a career, they have a life. So that's what

1472
02:25:11.60 --> 02:25:17.12
you're supporting. Also, environmentally, this is America. Exactly. We treat the environment well.

1473
02:25:17.12 --> 02:25:22.08
Those factories that you're buying from overseas, especially from these companies that claim to be

1474
02:25:22.08 --> 02:25:25.36
environmental companies and they're producing their stuff, why are they producing their stuff

1475
02:25:25.36 --> 02:25:28.24
overseas? Because overseas, they don't have the regulations, they don't have the environmental

1476
02:25:28.24 --> 02:25:33.60
regulations that we have to abide by, which we do gladly because we care about the environment,

1477
02:25:33.60 --> 02:25:37.68
we care about the water, right? Exactly. We care about the nature, we care about animals,

1478
02:25:37.68 --> 02:25:45.52
that's what we do. And so these big companies, they know that we're right and they are so horrified

1479
02:25:45.52 --> 02:25:50.96
that the words getting out, the words getting out that we're here, we're doing it, they're horrified.

1480
02:25:50.96 --> 02:25:56.000
If you want to help that out, originusa.com, get something that you're going to wear for the next

1481
02:25:56.56 --> 02:26:01.52
18 years. Exactly. You're going to wear a pair of jeans for 14 years. You're going to wear a pair

1482
02:26:01.52 --> 02:26:06.08
of these boots forever. They might be forever. I mean, how long are you going to live? Maybe you

1483
02:26:06.08 --> 02:26:12.56
live to be 100, right? But you're going to use a jiu-jitsu gi? Get one gi, get two gi's, you can

1484
02:26:12.56 --> 02:26:16.40
use them forever. And by the way, our jiu-jitsu gi, you can wash it in a normal washing machine,

1485
02:26:16.40 --> 02:26:21.36
it doesn't take nine hours to dry out. Like we're in a totally different world. Yeah. Plus it's

1486
02:26:21.36 --> 02:26:27.60
Christmas coming up. Christmas is coming up. Christmas is coming up and the economy, we all

1487
02:26:27.60 --> 02:26:32.88
know the economy needs help. Well, how do you help the economy? When you buy something from origin,

1488
02:26:32.88 --> 02:26:37.76
you're helping the economy here in America. There's a worker that's getting paid, that's earning

1489
02:26:37.76 --> 02:26:42.16
their career, that's paying their rent, paying their mortgage because of that. And then what do

1490
02:26:42.16 --> 02:26:44.96
they do? They take that paycheck and they put it back into America. It's like, that's what we're

1491
02:26:44.96 --> 02:26:53.04
doing. So originusa.com. Yep. Speaking of, speaking of Christmas, sometimes you want to get a shirt

1492
02:26:53.04 --> 02:26:58.000
or something now. People representing, I'm telling you, you want a Discipline Eagles freedom shirt

1493
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:04.08
or Hatter Hoodie, whatever, go to chocolatestore.com. Yeah. Speaking of which, my youngest daughter

1494
02:27:05.20 --> 02:27:09.76
is wrestling at this time. You know, it's wrestling season. We need some rash guards for her.

1495
02:27:09.76 --> 02:27:14.24
You know, just, I got you. You do kind of make that happen. Yeah. Yeah. We got a few rash guards on

1496
02:27:14.24 --> 02:27:18.56
there. She wants to represent. There you go. On the path. I'll get you a shirt too. All right.

1497
02:27:18.56 --> 02:27:23.20
You don't have one already. Get you a tank top, something like that. Also, short locker. It's

1498
02:27:23.20 --> 02:27:27.92
a subscription scenario where you get a shirt every month. Some good stuff coming out. No free

1499
02:27:27.92 --> 02:27:32.32
dopamine. It's going to be a good one. That one kind of kind of get some traction on that.

1500
02:27:33.36 --> 02:27:37.12
No free dopamine. There's some good ones on there. Good thing too. If you sign up, no matter when

you sign up, you have access to all the past shirts. Like if you think all you missed out or

1502
02:27:40.72 --> 02:27:45.04
something like that, you got access to that when you sign up. So whatever you need. Chocolatestore.com.

1503
02:27:45.04 --> 02:27:50.40
You know, again, like back in the day when I was a kid, if you had some kind of crazy sort of

1504
02:27:50.40 --> 02:27:54.24
movement in your life that you wanted to make a statement about, just get a t-shirt, bro.

1505
02:27:58.08 --> 02:28:01.20
Put your statement on the t-shirt. Where discipline equals freedom t-shirt. There you go.

1506
02:28:02.96 --> 02:28:06.56
In eight years, if you decide, you know what, I'm not really all about that discipline anymore.

1507
02:28:06.56 --> 02:28:11.60
Cool. You get a different t-shirt. Let's get some donuts. Right? Let's stick with that.

1508
02:28:11.60 --> 02:28:16.72
There's an anti-donut shirt coming out too, by the way. Shirt locker. Wow. That's controversial,

1509
02:28:16.72 --> 02:28:22.56
man. That's highly controversial. Yeah, that was kind of hard to pull off, you know, because like,

1510
02:28:22.56 --> 02:28:25.44
how do you, well, then again, there's a lot of ways to do it, but I think we got it.

1511
02:28:26.88 --> 02:28:33.44
Donuts. Look, again, for me, and I get it, I get that there's two sides to every controversial

1512
02:28:33.44 --> 02:28:40.48
thing in the world, but I just can't support donuts. I can't do it. I can't do it. So let me ask you

1513
02:28:40.48 --> 02:28:47.60
this. Like, so like, every once in a great while, every once in a great while, like when I finished

1514
02:28:49.76 --> 02:28:55.12
day zero of aerosol school in Hawaii, I was like, heck, I'm going to give me some donuts.

1515
02:28:55.76 --> 02:29:03.44
I earned this shit. Once in a great while. Yeah, I get it. What's your once in a great while?

1516
02:29:03.44 --> 02:29:11.28
I meant chocolate chip ice cream and straight, just chocolate chip cookies. All right. And, you know,

1517
02:29:11.28 --> 02:29:16.40
by the way, if you're out there and you're going to send chocolate chip cookies or cookies to

1518
02:29:16.40 --> 02:29:20.80
someone, just send them chocolate chip cookies. Don't send them peanut butter cookies. Definitely

1519
02:29:20.80 --> 02:29:24.96
don't send them oatmeal raising cookies. No, no, no, that's the question. Because oatmeal raising

1520
02:29:24.96 --> 02:29:32.000
cookies, look at first glance, I got chocolate chip cookies. What is the point? What is the point?

1521
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:40.08
So you might as well eat oatmeal, right? Come on. Come on. There are two kinds. There's two foods

1522
02:29:40.08 --> 02:29:48.56
that I don't like oatmeal and cooked carrots. Just just those are just two things. I'm not

1523
02:29:48.56 --> 02:29:52.16
really picky otherwise, but oatmeal and cooked carrots. I'm not happening. So Ryan Job,

1524
02:29:52.16 --> 02:30:01.36
Taskin and Bruiser God, God bless him. He was killed or he's wounded. Iraq died of wounds. He

1525
02:30:02.72 --> 02:30:14.48
hated cottage cheese. And so the smell of cottage cheese, he would start gagging. And there was a

1526
02:30:14.48 --> 02:30:23.76
time he was getting, let's say, some counseling from his platoon and he was under a kangaroo court,

1527
02:30:23.76 --> 02:30:28.24
right? And they're like, you know, Biggles, his nickname was Biggles. Biggles, you know, if you

1528
02:30:28.24 --> 02:30:31.36
really love, I forget what it was, but it's something like, you know, if you really love the

1529
02:30:31.36 --> 02:30:35.60
teams, you're going to eat this cottage cheese and like they're spooning it to his mouth. And as

1530
02:30:35.60 --> 02:30:41.20
he's go, as it's going to his mouth, he's like, he's just choking it down and throwing up. It was

1531
02:30:41.20 --> 02:30:47.28
freaking hysterical. So yeah, counseling. Yeah, he's getting some character building. You got to

1532
02:30:47.28 --> 02:30:52.32
watch out that. But there's certain foods that do that to some people. Yeah. And apparently it's

1533
02:30:52.32 --> 02:30:57.52
cooked carrots. Yeah, I just don't like them. The thing that I that has that effect, like that

1534
02:30:57.52 --> 02:31:04.40
physical effect is actually just bananas. Like I will throw frozen bananas in my smoothies.

1535
02:31:04.40 --> 02:31:13.84
Banana bread. Great. But I think it was because in basic training, like I, I mean, it was big,

1536
02:31:13.84 --> 02:31:20.56
it was you will eat one banana with every meal. Because of what I would just prevent cramping,

1537
02:31:20.56 --> 02:31:24.56
like, I don't know, whatever it was. And it just it literally got to a point where I was just like,

1538
02:31:25.12 --> 02:31:31.76
like the gag reflex was so I to this day, I don't, I won't eat. That's crazy. Because the banana in

1539
02:31:31.76 --> 02:31:37.52
the milkshake is that's the Tulsi jam or no, frozen frozen. Yeah, totally fine. Yeah, I won't

1540
02:31:37.52 --> 02:31:43.68
actually owe you money on that. Like, yeah, we've been propping up the Tulsi frozen banana.

1541
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:49.12
It adds just that little bit of cream and I love it. I love it. But it's just like that's the fresh

1542
02:31:50.08 --> 02:31:55.60
there was a I was on deployment. I was on a ship on deployment. There's no war going on. We're

1543
02:31:55.60 --> 02:32:02.48
just trying to get jacked. And there was this, this protein shake that was vanilla. And I was

1544
02:32:02.48 --> 02:32:10.64
drinking it like breakfast, lunch and dinner, trying to put on the game. And it was by the time,

1545
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:17.52
probably, probably two months into a six month deployment, I had to hold my nose and drink it

1546
02:32:17.52 --> 02:32:22.32
like it was just shot at tequila, just like, oh, it made me want maybe we're thrown up and that

1547
02:32:22.32 --> 02:32:27.84
kind of that kind of gave me like the kind of PTSD banana PTSD you're talking about. It's more the

1548
02:32:27.84 --> 02:32:33.28
association. Yeah, even to this day, vanilla is not one of my favorites just because of that one

1549
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.64
six month period of choking down. You know, when you go on deployment and you have like a,

1550
02:32:39.20 --> 02:32:44.32
like a palette and it's just filled with one flavor, you know, your screw. Totally. Especially

1551
02:32:44.32 --> 02:32:48.80
because on a ship, like the food kind of sucks. If you're not getting good, you got to get your

1552
02:32:48.80 --> 02:32:52.96
protein from somewhere. So there you go. But he, well, he can't technically back to the doughnuts

1553
02:32:52.96 --> 02:32:58.56
thing. He can't advocate even for moderation. I painted myself into a corner with donuts. I

1554
02:32:58.56 --> 02:33:02.32
painted myself into a corner with donuts, probably the one of the few things in the world, other

1555
02:33:02.32 --> 02:33:08.24
than if you're ISIS, we're not going to get along. The other one is like, I can't really decide, hey,

1556
02:33:08.24 --> 02:33:12.08
maybe donuts are okay on this occasion. Even when people have like protein donuts, you know,

1557
02:33:12.08 --> 02:33:16.88
talking about like nutrition solutions, they make protein donuts. I'm sure they're good to go.

1558
02:33:16.88 --> 02:33:23.44
And I'm sure they're, they're, they're like in compliance with the path. But I, I just can't

1559
02:33:23.44 --> 02:33:29.60
do it because it's a moral victory for the doughnut. Yeah, you declared anti doughnut early on too.

1560
02:33:29.60 --> 02:33:35.52
Yeah, I want hard. Yeah. So you cannot just like, like how you, and also, wait, is it my ego though?

1561
02:33:36.16 --> 02:33:40.08
It's just my ego. It's part of the gig for sure. Or is it just, Hey, I'm going to just maintain the

1562
02:33:40.08 --> 02:33:44.96
path here. Oh yeah. That's a good point. I don't know. It's like, but there's that other part too,

1563
02:33:44.96 --> 02:33:48.48
though, just like the alcohol. You know how like, you're like, Hey, I can't advocate for alcohol

1564
02:33:48.48 --> 02:33:54.000
at all. Well, even though we all know that, Hey, most people in moderation, then they're not going

1565
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.64
to have problems. But you start advocating for donuts, alcohol, whatever. Some people are like,

1566
02:33:58.64 --> 02:34:02.88
Hey, chocolate, it's okay. Yeah, they start freaking pounding donuts every week. You know,

1567
02:34:02.88 --> 02:34:09.28
can't do that. Can still, his moderation can be subjective. Exactly. I'll only eat five a week

1568
02:34:09.28 --> 02:34:13.20
instead of today. I ate less today than I did yesterday. So whatever, you know, wait, you're

1569
02:34:13.20 --> 02:34:19.36
vegan, right? Yeah. Now our donuts vegan. Some are. And there is a pop up in Hawaii

1570
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:27.12
that only opens up for four hours on the weekends and it's first come, first serve. And they usually

1571
02:34:27.12 --> 02:34:33.28
sell out in the first hour vegan donuts. And they are, I will show you pictures afterward. They are

1572
02:34:33.28 --> 02:34:42.16
the most heavenly, luxuriously like, Oh my gosh, you just look at it and it's like a whole meal in

1573
02:34:42.16 --> 02:34:48.48
one donut. It's like, yeah, it's, it's a totally different situation. Where do you get your protein

1574
02:34:48.48 --> 02:34:57.12
from? I take, I drink protein shakes every day. And it's primarily coming from a pea protein source.

1575
02:34:58.16 --> 02:35:04.40
I used to do whey protein, but I long have you been a vegan for probably the last, I don't know,

1576
02:35:04.40 --> 02:35:10.96
for five years, vegetarian my whole life. And then ethical reasons, environmental reasons,

1577
02:35:10.96 --> 02:35:19.04
spiritual reasons, all of the above. Have you had a steak before? No. No, I feel like I want to take

1578
02:35:19.04 --> 02:35:23.76
a dinner. That response is the response that I've gotten most often, especially in the military,

1579
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:30.08
but it's like, it's not, it's not something I've ever had. So it's like you saying that, I have no

1580
02:35:30.08 --> 02:35:38.64
desire whatsoever. Rogan, I met Rogan for lunch or dinner, whatever one day with some of his friends.

1581
02:35:38.64 --> 02:35:47.76
And they went to, what's the, what's the Brazilian folk of the child? And he didn't really comment

1582
02:35:47.76 --> 02:35:53.44
it on the time, but he mentioned recently in a podcast, he's like, we went there and all she ate

1583
02:35:53.44 --> 02:35:59.28
was salad. How is that even possible? But it's just, it's not something, you know, there's no,

1584
02:36:00.08 --> 02:36:05.44
there's no craving, I guess. That's interesting. You guys just discussed, because you know,

1585
02:36:05.44 --> 02:36:11.36
diet, hotteries, kids, I think exercise might be another one, religion and politics, those are the

1586
02:36:11.36 --> 02:36:15.92
hot button subjects. So we're covering all of them today? Yeah, but this is the one you guys are

1587
02:36:15.92 --> 02:36:20.56
opposed to. That's the thing. But I think, I think this is, this is like a good example though,

1588
02:36:20.56 --> 02:36:28.64
because it's one thing to say, you know, like, Hey, this is my choice for my life and my lifestyle.

1589
02:36:29.52 --> 02:36:33.04
I'm not trying to go around saying every single person in the world has to

1590
02:36:33.04 --> 02:36:39.84
follow my exact life choices in all of those examples. If we hung out more, like if I moved back to

1591
02:36:39.84 --> 02:36:45.76
Hawaii and, and we were hanging out more, would you kind of start to be like, Hey, you know,

1592
02:36:46.32 --> 02:36:50.08
man, why are you eating all that steak? Do you think you would to try and help me?

1593
02:36:51.84 --> 02:36:57.12
Not unless you were saying, Hey, Tulsi, I feel like shit and my body's not functioning. What would

1594
02:36:57.12 --> 02:37:02.64
you advise or what's working for you? But otherwise no, that's kind of good. Because then that's

1595
02:37:02.64 --> 02:37:06.000
what I was thinking too. As you were saying, I was thinking, if you said to me like, Hey,

1596
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:10.32
I don't feel that good. I feel lethargic. I'd be like, Hey, we're going out for steak.

1597
02:37:13.84 --> 02:37:19.60
All right. What else? Echo Charles. So that's the short lockers. Yep. Stuff like this.

1598
02:37:19.60 --> 02:37:20.48
Yep. Subscribe.

1599
02:37:21.52 --> 02:37:29.44
Jocko Underground.com. This is a platform that we made in case we get kicked off of other platforms

1600
02:37:29.44 --> 02:37:33.92
straight up. That's what's going on. That's the reality of what we face. And so if you go to

1601
02:37:33.92 --> 02:37:38.16
jockounderground.com, you can get on that platform. It costs $8 and 18 cents a month.

1602
02:37:38.64 --> 02:37:42.48
How'd you choose that number? By the way, I've always been curious.

1603
02:37:44.48 --> 02:37:49.84
Is it an area code thing or? No, well, actually put it this way. There was the first reason,

1604
02:37:49.84 --> 02:37:54.16
the primary reason. And then there's like a secondary reason that that shuffled like right in

1605
02:37:54.16 --> 02:37:59.84
there as well. The secondary reason is from the Bible's like current sufferings don't outweigh

1606
02:37:59.84 --> 02:38:06.08
future glory, something like this. And then, but the primary reason was hardcore recondos.

1607
02:38:06.08 --> 02:38:11.76
Yeah. It's HR. It's eighth letter in the 18th, which we've, which we've never divulged until this

1608
02:38:11.76 --> 02:38:16.32
moment. So that's what it is. The hardcore recondos out there. Both of those are pretty powerful

1609
02:38:17.84 --> 02:38:22.64
meanings. And look, if you can't afford that, which I get it's tight times and they're going to get

1610
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:27.36
tighter, there's a recession. Am I allowed to say there's a recession coming? I think there are a

1611
02:38:27.36 --> 02:38:32.64
lot of economists who would agree with you. If times get too tight and you can't afford it,

1612
02:38:32.64 --> 02:38:39.28
just email email assistance at jockounderground.com. We'll get you hooked up there. You and check out

1613
02:38:39.28 --> 02:38:44.80
Tulsi's sub sub stack. Yep. Where they just Google sub stack. Tulsi, if you go on sub stack and you

1614
02:38:44.80 --> 02:38:51.44
just put in Tulsi or Tulsi Gabbard, it'll pop up there. Almost everything I put up is not behind

1615
02:38:51.44 --> 02:38:56.40
a paywall. Um, if you want to kind of get in on the conversation, I think it's like six bucks a

1616
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:00.16
month or something. How'd you come up with that number? Six bucks a month? Ah, it's just the

1617
02:39:00.16 --> 02:39:07.36
average of what's out there. I don't have a Bible verse to back it up. Clearly a missed opportunity.

1618
02:39:07.92 --> 02:39:12.88
You know, I just giving you that opportunity. Then YouTube, we got the jocco podcast, YouTube

1619
02:39:12.88 --> 02:39:21.04
channel and origin USA YouTube channel. And then the Tulsi Gabbard show, I think is your YouTube

1620
02:39:21.04 --> 02:39:27.52
channel. Yeah. And subscribe to that. Everywhere you get your podcasts, um, these platforms are

1621
02:39:27.52 --> 02:39:32.24
growing. They're new. And so for people, if you watch or you listen and you like it,

1622
02:39:32.80 --> 02:39:38.56
subscribe, leave a rating and share it with others. That's the plan. Psychological warfare is out

1623
02:39:38.56 --> 02:39:45.60
there. You need that. That jocco influence. Maybe I need some jocco discipline to make a new one of

1624
02:39:45.60 --> 02:39:50.72
those. Yeah. It's been a while. I need to ask me some of those questions. What's good for the goose

1625
02:39:50.72 --> 02:39:56.32
is good. Good for the other guy. Flipside, canvas.com, Dakota Myers company, bunch of books,

1626
02:39:56.96 --> 02:40:03.60
a bunch of a written a bunch of books, only cry for the living by holiday day. Great, great

1627
02:40:03.60 --> 02:40:08.88
Christmas gifts. Oh, I think people are looking. I mean, you know, it's just like, I, you know,

1628
02:40:09.68 --> 02:40:16.000
when I think of gifts that I want to give people, they should be gifts of meaning and substance

1629
02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:21.20
ideally rather than just something that is cheap and can be easily thrown away and become part

1630
02:40:21.20 --> 02:40:26.56
of a landfill somewhere. That's what I think, you know, books are good. These books are, are

1631
02:40:26.56 --> 02:40:30.88
fantastic. Some of the things you're talking about earlier because for me, I actually know,

1632
02:40:30.88 --> 02:40:35.76
you can get audio books and, you know, e-books and all that, but I'm one of those people who,

1633
02:40:35.76 --> 02:40:41.04
like if I'm taking notes and getting ready for a TV interview, I'll look at what's on the computer

1634
02:40:41.04 --> 02:40:44.40
and then I actually sit there and actually write it down. There's something about reading words

1635
02:40:44.40 --> 02:40:48.80
on the page that you can keep going back to. You can highlight, you can kind of bend the

1636
02:40:48.80 --> 02:40:54.88
corner of the page over and know that that's something that you can use and keep going back

1637
02:40:54.88 --> 02:41:04.24
to. Yeah, I am a huge physical books guy and there's definitely some sort of rote memorization

1638
02:41:04.24 --> 02:41:07.76
that happens or absorption that happens when you write stuff down, you highlight it and all that

1639
02:41:07.76 --> 02:41:14.40
stuff. So yeah, you can get all these books for Christmas for somebody and they can really help.

1640
02:41:14.40 --> 02:41:18.32
I'll tell you what, honestly, just get the kids you know, get the kids you know, the Warrior

1641
02:41:18.32 --> 02:41:23.20
Kid books. Yeah. Just to help them with life. It'll help them in so many different ways and

1642
02:41:23.20 --> 02:41:27.28
there's so much, look, we spent the first, I don't know, 40 minutes today talking about all the

1643
02:41:27.28 --> 02:41:33.12
negative influence that there is out there on kids and social media. Don't let them be exposed that

1644
02:41:33.12 --> 02:41:38.24
or if they do get exposed to it, let them have some kind of a grounding and a foundation to think

1645
02:41:38.24 --> 02:41:42.88
through what's going on and get on the right path as a human being. Way the Warrior Kid.

1646
02:41:42.88 --> 02:41:47.52
One, two, three, four, five is coming by the way. Oh damn. Yeah. It's called Letters from Uncle Jake.

1654
02:42:27.28 --> 02:42:31.60
happen. No offense to Tulsi, but it takes more than that. You're going to have, it's going to take

with Tulsi on the interwebs, TulsiGabbard.com on social media, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Facebook.

1663

02:43:23.76 --> 02:43:29.92
her sub stack that we talked about. So check all that as well. And as far as Echo and I are

1665
02:43:29.92 --> 02:43:36.40
concerned, Echo's at Echo Troll. So I am at Jocko Wink. But listen, the algorithm, just watch out

1666
02:43:36.40 --> 02:43:40.80
for the algorithm because it is definitely looking to grab you and they're looking to brainwash you.

1667
02:43:42.16 --> 02:43:46.40
And if you go into it knowing that they're looking to brainwash you, that's a good step in the right

1668
02:43:46.40 --> 02:43:52.56
direction. Huge. But if you go into it thinking that you're getting smarter because of this,

1669
02:43:52.56 --> 02:43:56.64
that's a bad situation that you're getting yourself into. So just please be careful.

1670
02:43:56.64 --> 02:44:01.36
Be careful with this social media. Use it. Use it for something positive though.

1671
02:44:02.08 --> 02:44:08.72
And only use it for a limited amount of time. All right, please. There you go. Tulsi, any closing

1672
02:44:08.72 --> 02:44:17.20
thoughts for us? God, we covered a lot. It's great to see you guys. Great to be back.

1673
02:44:17.20 --> 02:44:26.08
Yeah, I just to add on to what you just said, you know, don't underestimate the power of your own

1674
02:44:26.08 --> 02:44:32.88
voice. Understand the responsibility that each of us has on the impact that we make in the world

1675
02:44:32.88 --> 02:44:40.000
and know that the choices we make every day can lead to having a positive or negative impact.

1676
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.88
So be an independent thinker, be discerning and be intentional with the choices that you make

1677
02:44:46.88 --> 02:44:53.76
both for yourself and for those around you. Sounds like a plan. Thanks for joining us again.

1678
02:44:53.76 --> 02:44:57.04
Thank you. I'm sure we'll see you again. Thanks for your service in the army. Thanks for your service

1679
02:44:57.04 --> 02:45:02.64
in Congress. Thanks for your service in America. And now I guess thank you for your service to

1680
02:45:02.64 --> 02:45:13.36
the world as you try and help people by spreading Aloha worldwide. And thanks to all of our service

1681
02:45:13.36 --> 02:45:18.08
members around the world in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Thank you for protecting our

1682
02:45:18.08 --> 02:45:22.16
freedom. The same goes here at home to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

1683
02:45:22.16 --> 02:45:28.80
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

1684
02:45:28.80 --> 02:45:37.04
Thanks for what you do on a daily basis to keep us safe here at home. And everyone else out there,

1685
02:45:38.64 --> 02:45:44.48
the world is a crazy place right now and it will drive you crazy if you let it.

1686
02:45:46.08 --> 02:45:54.40
My recommendation is that you remain sane, that you stay balanced, that you don't let bots

1687
02:45:54.40 --> 02:46:05.28

02:46:10.88 --> 02:46:17.92

02:46:17.92 --> 02:46:27.92
Echo and Jaco. Out.
