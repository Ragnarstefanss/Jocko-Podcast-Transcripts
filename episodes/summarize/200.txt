I mean I knew when my rotation date was but a lot of guys actually made what was called a short time calendar that's a bad idea never never never did that at all so you just every day was a new day you're going to do your best job and if you're doing what you're doing that's the best you can do and that's one more thing I wanted to say this because again we got young folks in the military out there when I was talking about hey some people are afraid some people are in a afraid some people think it's gonna happen them some people think it'll never happen them look wherever you are on that spectrum what what I can say is this there's things that you can control there's things that you can't control and as you're going into combat before you're going to combat train hard be prepared know your weapon systems know your immediate action drills then that's that's the best you can do you've done everything you can to take control over what you can control once you're in combat there's some things that you're not going to be able to control and if you worry about those things it's actually a set it actually negatively impact you if you're worried about things that you can't control if you're worried about what's going on at home if you're worried about mate all those things they're gonna take away your aggressiveness take take away your awareness take away your attention those things are gonna drag you in the wrong direction so don't worry about the things that you can't control it's okay to be afraid too like but he probably wouldn't listen to anybody else because Chris had a great deal of experience driving for it that's one of the misconceptions about the military and it's really one of the misconceptions about leadership is is the last thing that I want as a leader is to have a bunch of yes men that are just going to do what I tell them to do because I told them to do it I want people that are going to say hey Jock I don't know if that's the best idea or hey that we should do this a different way and and people don't think that that's going to happen in the military that's what you want you want that kind of environment inside the military and the good thing is that way when I would make a call and guys would execute I knew it was a good call because no one gave me any pushback because believe me I had a relationship with my guys if I was saying tell them to do something stupid they'd say hey boss we need to we need to put go go on hold right now and figure this out there's got to be a better way so that's the way that that's how I that's how I make good decisions not because I'm great it's because I got a bunch of great guys working for me that are going to tell me hey that's not the right call and that's a classic example right there you know if if Chris who had the experience and had the the the the the where we're fall to say hey boss we don't want to cross right there it's not a good call let's just go 10 meters down mix it up a little bit that's the kind of thing where that that would save lives and the other thing that you just talked about this is another thing that people get really surprised about is even because we work I work with a lot of companies and businesses and people say well you know my guys get complacent with things because you know there's there's it's not combat so people get complacent I always have to explain people get complacent in combat too you go on you go on your 14th patrol on a row in a row and nothing's happened for the last 13 patrols and you think oh you know we can we can cross here or we don't need to we need to pack extra ammo or I don't need to carry that extra radio battery because I have a needed yet but maybe we should go to woodstock I don't think anybody did though but did you feel like like I know that our treatment from the wars from the wars that we've been in the last couple decades you know we've had great treatment from for the most part we've had incredibly incredible treatment from not just from well from from people from normal citizens you know that it's thank you for your service it's thank you for what you did regardless of whatever their political beliefs are as well it's like most people say hey we know that you were doing your job and and that's thank you did you feel mattered did you feel did you feel like it was did you get the negative feedback that we often hear about from Vietnam bets I never got any of the negative Well you get up and fix breakfast you know fix some coffee or some sea rations and you know easy to carry it because your armored personnel carriers wait didn't make a lot of different stuff we'd have somebody would fix this somebody would fix the coffee we'd all kind of share the meal together because you didn't have any food that came out to the field very often and we just sit down maybe the night before that morning with the L.T. and go over what the daily operation was and follow up with a myler cover on the map sheet and a grease pencil and you know go through the checkpoints throughout the course of the day you know if you faced any any difficulties you you know just faced it had on return fire called in artillery maybe you'd get a call an infantry unit to be pinned down nice part of about being armored personnel carriers you could move real fast lay down a lot of suppressing fire and let them back out and save them we did that from Marines as well as United States Army so then um and then this is just what you do this is just the day in day out all day every day and you're during the night time you you stay you know you stay on watch so I don't think it was as easy for him to be a strong leader and a strong decision maker because I think that was on his mind a lot the L.T. was not that way and everybody that we served with was not that way I don't know if I know anybody else that I served with for 10 and a half months that was married other than most of the platoon sergeants or the first sergeant so they have that in the back of their mind they're thinking about you can sense that there may be leaning a little bit towards trying to stay alive and trying to take less risk and you know to all that works is that's not always the best person to have for a leader if you're not tuned in 24-7 while you're there you're in trouble you know that's the only way to survive you have to be conscious of every fly that lands on on your food you know what I mean you're just you just get that heightened sense of awareness that it's probably lucky you can even go to sleep when you lay down at night because you're the adrenaline is pumps so much all day long so I'm sure probably in the back of my mind the use of it or abuse of it was probably something I was conscious of all the time but that never really looked like that was a great alternative path I mean I thought that was fairly easy to recognize that that wasn't good and and I'm not critical of anyone that chose that because everybody's psyche and the way they're handling things at that time the difficulties you're going through or just being out in public missing two legs in a room maybe you need to be high to do that I never felt that way I didn't feel like I needed to explain anything to anybody had to put on any particular performance or airstone make people accept me if you didn't accept me I'm okay with that too you know what I mean that was fine because I'm just going to do what I need to do for my survival and for me to move forward so the biggest thing that we had to do and I mean that was the number one thing in part of the training with you drove where you were commanding a track was you never take the same stream crossing twice you you track the vehicle right directly in front of you you never get outside of the lead tracks tracks in the ground and we'd stay in the patties or around the patties as much as possible because it weren't very likely to put a landmine in the rice patties it would be on the road or the edge of the road or maybe on a rice petty pike that we never never went in that direction very often either and what was your leadership like you know your your young lieutenant platoon commander what was he like what was your platoon sergeant like what did what was your interaction with those guys like and even your vehicle so who was in charge of of your track was he was a young E5 probably 21 or 22 years old at that time and the leadership in my platoon the platoon leader was was a great first lieutenant like oh no you don't need to do that you don't need to do that like kind of like no you can actually do this other thing kind of thing like he made it sound so casual what almost like hey it's almost like he he reversed it all the way back down to the bare decision making of it you know rather than like it's no big deal that's what people feel it's you don't need to think your your weak because you're feeling that you're just going into survival mode you got butterflies in your stomach because your blood's drawn away from there because you want to focus on other things it's a positive thing so don't worry about those things you can't control focus on what you can control and if you're if you're feeling a little bit afraid good that means your your mind isn't the right place you're aware and you're in a hyper sensory mode so you can survive out on the battlefield that's what's going on um what was the what was going on with the mission where you got wounded we've been out on a searching clear for that whole day I mean probably it'd been out in the field for six or seven days at that point I had picked the night longer position we set up that evening about five to six o'clock we were supposed to get resupply and get get hotchow that night brought up by helicopter so I mean it was a real easy decision for me and like October early November 69 that we'll just put those in a trunk someplace and have great memories about walking in the parallel bars so you were done with rehab at nine months well really once you heal and if you're not going to do anything further with prosthetic legs and they need a bed because you're still killing and injuring a lot of people in Vietnam in November 1969 you know you got to move on something's got to happen so 1969 this is this is at the height of like anti-war protests and woodstock was in woodstock was in August of 1969 are you paying attention to that is that entering your world at all or we're we're watching it on the ward in the day room and probably just getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment out of it because we're all sitting around we're all Vietnam combat soldiers you know on the ward I mean it because it's like you still feel like you have those limbs like you feel like you need to scratch behind your knee or scratch you know your hand is itching that type of thing it's almost like you're bald up in a fist where your fingernails are pushed into your hand type of thing and little by little I think is those nerve endings received from the surgery and the amputations a lot of that relaxes and changes I don't get that at all anymore That's good did you and then did you eventually make E6 I did and did that change your position again at some point did you become like the vehicle commander I became what was called the field for a surge with the called six alpha in the in the army I was on the command track out in the field with the company commander and then two other machine gunners on our track so you did you leave your platoon to go and be with the company commander I did and what's your what's your job when you're in that position well basically everything you do for the daily operation you're kind of in charge over overseeing everything you're you know because keep in mind now we've got not just my third platoon out there but the second and the first might be with us or they might be off on an operation of their own sometimes two platoons that go out together and we wanted to go a different direction so you had to be cognizant of where everybody was all the time and what they were doing and any difficulties that they were having and it was a brand new company commander who did not have any Vietnam experience so then it was almost like having to train the CO once he got there but I always felt that if you were thinking about other things like family that was going to make you less aggressive and as far as I can tell if you're aggression if you're not aggressive on the battlefield that has a higher probability of getting you killed than if you're aggressive I think that hesitation is a bad thing and I'm looking at saying and I used to try and make this clear all the time and I'm talking about you know being hyper aggressive and running to your death that's not what I'm talking about but if there's something going on and you're nervous about making a move that's not a good thing to have happening and it would make when I would have guys that I could see you were thinking about other things it would make me nervous that they were going to hesitate when they needed to move or needed to make something happen. personally I know a lot of people who did and most of that was people who came back uningered we got off of that same transport a travel-sair force base or or up at Fort Lewis Washington moved to a civilian aircraft most of them would change out of their military clothing in the civilian clothing so that they couldn't be recognized or wouldn't be readily identified as being returning from Vietnam the only thing that I ever really experienced that I didn't know this until after I got to fit Simmons was lawrear force base used to be right in downtown Denver and that's normally where the transport would have brought me would have been to lawreary but because they were having protesters outside the gate at lawrear force base they landed in an old world war two-feel called Buckley Field outside of Denver and the protesters never knew where that was at so then they'd load you on the on the hospital bus and take you right to the hospital luckily the protesters weren't smart enough to figure that out so you get done with this you get discharged from the army that's it but you're in a perimeter somehow and circle up just like wagon trains and an old western television program like John Wayne in the guys and and then everybody would stay up on the track there'd be two hours segments from 10 to midnight on down to 6 o'clock in the morning you'd rotate every two hours and you just be you know you'd have clay mors out and set up your perimeter defense and everything you'd call in dead cons so that you had positions available for local artillery could drop stuff real quick if you needed to have it now it seems like it would not be a great move for the the conner for the NVA to attack you know this you guys I mean how how often did they attack and we cut those corners when you get complacent that's when these horrible things happen you cannot get complacent and all those all those service men out there right now service men and women don't cut corners don't do it you got to hold the line and if you see people cutting corners call them out one of the biggest things that some of the infantry units used to do is get complacent and not put claim wars out when they set up for the night and just like you mentioned it might have worked 12 or 13 times before but the one time you decide you're going to leave it in your pack that's exactly when Charlie decides to come through the perimeter not that he knew but you weren't prepared you know that's that's the guaranteed way to get attacked don't set up claim wars every time you set up claim wars in your prepared and everyone standard watch correctly that's how you don't get attacked the minute that someone slacks off yeah that's that's what that's what sent you going sideways now you mentioned the draftees that pretty much when you were there once you guys were in country once you were doing your job did you could you even tell the difference between who's a draftee and who wasn't only if you would ask him if that was the case because there was no other identification anybody but you know again I say this because in ten and a half months period of time they were still the most courageous and brave people that I've ever served with I think they resolved all that draft stuff and I don't want to be here before they got in country or right after they got in country because they were they were not complacent at all once once I started to work with them yeah check it out flip side canvas dot com to get things graphic designs to hang up in your house so that you can stay on the path also i've written a bunch of books the next one that's coming out it's called leadership strategy and tactics and it is available for pre-order right now it is a field manual of how to lead pragmatically how to lead actual instructions and actual field manual on how to lead also have way the warrior kid one two and three get those books for every kid you know and the library and the school because every kid should be reading those i hear that at least once a day someone tells me every kid should get issued these books i agree why because we all wish we had the way the warrior kid books when we were kids we didn't have them and we suffer the consequences don't don't punish the children of the world get them the books and also if you got a younger kid get a mickey in the dragons which by the way somebody bought the flip side canvas mickey in the dragons poster uh and said that this was the this was the what they read with their son before the son went on deployment so it's but I mean I think you're you're kind of still in a form of survival mode at that point you know to mean each each new experience I mean getting in and out of the shower getting on and off of a commode feeding yourself putting clothes on wondering if you're gonna be able to drive again are the things that are paramount in your mind at that point because you know what it takes to do stuff out there in the world and I mean it's not like you did that one day in the next day it was perfect you know it was still a process every day you'd have to kind of go through that little bit of surrender all the time until you finally just came to the conclusion that if you just relax do what you're supposed to do everything else is going to be okay in a truly turned out that way so that when you're going to occupational therapy is that when you're are you still at fit Simmons when you're talking about that and and I always you know I hear a lot of people ask me about again the skating into the business world people ask me about what it's like to or you know how how do you handle these millennials and I always bring up people like hackworth who says who hackworth said he loved his draftees but then he said and I want to kind of let I'm paraphrasing obviously I want to let everyone know that you don't you don't have to give up or something he said he didn't say don't give up like a bit this big thing it's like he said you don't need to give up do kind of thing because it when my mind that are worth owning so I would buy him kept him for rental property and still have all those today nice moves I gotta ask you this because you know a lot of a lot of vets listen to this what did you see in terms of alcohol and drugs especially when you were in rehab when you're coming out of rehab what did you see what was your attitude how did you avoid going down the path of where people end up you know either addicted alcohol or addicted to drugs you know I mean just in terms of how often were you guys taking casualties and I know I looked there's a really good website that you guys have from F troop and Vietnam and it in why the numbers are down in 1967 so before you showed up there was there was four people from from F troop that were killed in action in 1968 so the year that you were there that number went up five times these were and according to that document it said that there was 20 20 men killed in action in 1968 so that is some heavy contact I mean that's more than 10 percent that's more than 10 percent that's not that's not counting wounded in action that's all killed in action so even though you said the enemy wasn't attacking you very often you guys must have been in some significant enemy contacts to be taken those those kind of casualties. I mean it's it's a shock to think that anything like that can happen in two buildings full of people just unbelievable now did you immediately I mean we were in an afghanistan bi October when you think in yourself where there's war there's gonna be wounded and the DAV and year you know you talked about how much it helped you to meet somebody that was a triple ampute two months before you three months before you they didn't even have much experience with it so I look forward to having that opportunity to do that and one of the guys I mean this is fast forwarding some but a young man came back at injured in September of 2004 and he was also a triple ampute he lost both legs and an arm and you because of the hip a law as you had to go through and get permission to visit people in the hospital well he had originally been on our list and then he'd scratched the DAV off of that because they were kind of getting tired of politicians just coming into in photo ops with seriously injured vets so he kind of thought that's what it was well we were visiting another young guy there was a single leg amputee on the physical therapy ward and he was in a bed maybe 15 feet away so he called the officer over that was with us and said who the hell's that guy said well that's the guy was going to come to visit and goes we're not playing every club we can't do it we don't have the time so if you want to come to the monster in Sydney Australia it's December 4th and 5th go to extremownership dot com every monster we've done has sold out so register early we also have ef Overwatch so if you have a company and you want spec ops or combat aviation leaders coming into your company to help with your leadership then go to ef overwatch dot com to connect and find one of those leaders to come into your company and if you have comments or questions or answers for us you can find them on the interwebs you can find us on the interwebs we are on Twitter we are on Instagram and we are on Facebook key uh for the disabled American veterans they are at d a v h q on Instagram and on Twitter and then on Facebook key they are just at d a v and echo is at echo Charles and i am at jockel willink and once again thanks to Mr. Jim surzly for sharing his story with us and i am it's such an honor for me to be able to talk with such men and women who have given so much and yet they continue to give and to all the other veterans out there to those that have served and those that are serving and those that are holding the line as we speak thanks to each one of you for fighting for our freedom and to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders each of you work so hard and give so much to keep us safe here at home so thanks to all of you as well for your service and to everyone else out there you just heard another example of what the human will is capable of and even when facing the most unimaginable challenges even when ripped apart by a bomb the will to live and the will to fight and the will to overcome is unstoppable and what that makes me wonder what are we capable of what are we capable of if we summoned the kind of will that Jim certainly has are we doing everything right now that we are capable of doing are we reaching our potential how much more could we do how much more could we do there's only one way to find out and that is to step up into the breach to put yourself out there every day and do everything you possibly can to get after it and until next time this is echo and jacco out
