yeah talking about that guy um back to the book but in seeking to formulate the experience of the Napoleonic wars the emphasis he put on certain retrograde retrograde features helped to cause what might be termed a revolution in reverse back towards true drive-alarm fair Claus Witz theory of the military aim into finding the military aim Claus Witz was carried away by his passion for pure logic quote the and this this makes it really odd this starts to make it really obvious why this stuff doesn't mend with my normal way of thinking quote the aim of all action in war is to disarm the enemy and we shall now show that this inferior at least is indispensable if our opponent is to be made to comply with our will we must place him in a situation where which is more oppressive to him than the sacrifice we demand but the disadvantages of this position must naturally not be of a transitory nature at least in appearance otherwise the enemy instead of yielding will hold out in the hope of a change for the better every change in this position which is produced by a continuation of war must therefore be a change for the worse worse the worst condition in which a belligerent can be placed is that of being completely disarmed if therefore the enemy is to be reduced to an into submission he must either be positively disarmed or placed in such a position that he is threatened with it from this follows that the complete disarming or overthrow of the enemy must always be the aim of warfare and quote this reminds me of the bath party in Iraq being completely disarmed how much did that help my freaking hurt right maybe some class witsy and people were saying yep got to disarm them completely completely good job the influence of of can't cont where's where's Darrell Cooper of Darrell Cooper's making jokes about like he's just bringing in deep the echo and I are looking at him like bro wrong crowd the influence of cont can be perceived in class wits dualism of thought he believed in a perfect military world of ideals while recognizing a temporal world in which these could only be imperfectly fulfilled so he's giving credit here's a little credit going back to to class wits like hey man he got it that you got these ideals but everything takes a different shape when we pass from abstractions to reality this object of war in the abstract the disarming of the enemy is rarely attained in practice and is not a condition necessary to peace so he wasn't even saying what he was saying he goes back and kind of backs off it a little bit cost wits his tendency to the extreme is shown again in his discussion of battle as a means to in to the end of war he opened with the startling assertion there is only one single means it is the fight he justified this by a long argument to show that in every form of military activity quote the idea of fighting must necessarily be at the foundation and quote having elaborately proved what most people would be ready to accept without argument cause would said the object of a combat is not always the destruction of enemy forces its object can often be attained as well without the combat taking place at all so there you go he's saying some of the stuff that that I do agree with more over class which recognized that quote the waste of our own military forces must set a risk parabas which means all things being equal always be greater the moral aim is directed upon the destruction of the enemy's power the danger lies in this that the greater efficacy which we which we seek recoils on ourselves and therefore has worse consequences in case we fail of success so he's got some he's got some quantifying statements about his about his thoughts and theories out of his own mouth class with here gave a prophetic verdict upon the consequences of following his own gospel in World War one and two for it was the ideal and not the practical aspect of his teachings on battle which survived he contributed to this distortion by arguing it was only to avoid the risks of battle that quote any other means are taken so it's like we're trying to avoid battle that's the only reason that we're going to do anything else because we're trying to avoid battle and he fixed the distortion in the minds of his pupils by hammering on the abstract ideal. I mean he covered it he did his best to cover it much of the harm might have been avoided but for that fatal cholera germ for there are significant indications that in the gradual evolution of his thought he had reached a point where he was about to drop his original concept of absolute war and revise his whole theory on more common sense lines when death intervened in consequence the way was left open to endless misconceptions far excessive his anticipation for the universal adoption of the theory of unlimited war has gone far to wreck civilization the teaching of classmates taken without understanding largely influenced both the causation and the character of world war one thereby it led on all two logically to world war two theory and flux next section after world war one the course and effects of the first world war provided ample cause to doubt the validity of cross with theory at least interpreted by his successors on land and numerical battles will fought without ever producing the decisive result expected of them but the responsible leaders were slow to adapt their aim to circumstances or develop new means to make the aim more possible and maybe that's why when he was going through the eight um items that we were talking about earlier on the earlier podcast his number one thing remember you're saying the number one thing was his number eight thing his number one thing was adjust your adjust your end to your means and here he's saying the responsible leaders were slow to adapt their aim to the circumstances or develop new means to make the aim more possible instead of facing the problem they pressed theory to a suicide-licks stream draining their own strength beyond the safety limit in pursuit of an ideal of complete victory by battle which was never fulfilled that one side ultimately collapsed that one side ultimately collapsed so the Germans ultimately collapsed do more to emptiness of stomach produced by economic pressure of sea power than the loss of blood although blood which was lost in the abortive German offensive of 1918 and the loss of spirit in consequence of their palpable failure to gain the victory hasten the collapse if this provided the opposition the opposing nations with the semblance of victory their efforts to win it cost them such a price in moral and physical exhaustion that they the seeming victors will left incapable of consolidating their position. it is the negation of statemanship and intelligent strategy which seeks to serve the ends of policy if war be a continuation of policy as clouds with its head elsewhere declared it it must necessarily be conducted with a view to post war benefit a state which expands its strength to the point of exhaustion bank rubs its own policy and by the way that's at all players in world war one cost with himself had qualified the principle of quote utmost force by the admission that quote the political object as the original motive of war should be the standard for determining both the aim of the military force and also the amount of effort to be made still more significant was a reflective passage in which he remarked that to pursue the logical extreme and tailed that quote the means would lose all relation to the end and in most cases the aim at an extreme effort would be wrecked by the opposite weight of forces within itself what's the what's the return on investment you're going to get his classic work on war was the product of 12 years of intensive thought if it's author had lived to spend a longer time in thinking about war he might have reached a wiser and clearer conclusion as his thinking progressed he was being led toward a different view penetrating deeper unhappily the process was cut short by his death from cholera in 1830 it was only after his death that his writings on war were published by his widow they were found in a number of sealed packets bearing the significant and prophetic note so he wrote a note on his writings and it said should the work be interrupted by my death then what is found can only be called a massive conceptions not brought into form open to endless misconceptions but then he even get to finish his book he wrote free get three chapters and his old lady finished it up uh such a commandment gave reinforcement to the instinctive conservatism of soldiers in resisting the possibilities of a new form of superiority which mechanical invention increasingly offered it also gave powerful impulse to the universal extension and permanent establishment of the method of constricted conscription as a simple way of providing the greatest possible numbers so if you want a big army well if I want to be in charge of a bunch of people you know what I have to say look we need more people if we're gonna win cool start drafting people I want to be in charge more people cool draft more people this by its disregard for psychological suitability meant that armies became much more liable to panic and sudden collapse the earlier method however unsystematic had at least tended to ensure that the forces were composed of good fighting animals this is an interesting shot at classmates classmates contributed no new or strikingly progressive ideas to tactics or strategies he was a codifying thinker rather than a creative or dynamic one he had no such revolutionary effect on warfare as the theory of the divisional system produced in the 18th century or the theory of armored mobility in the 20th which by the way that's what kind of the delheart like is about right and then I was looking at what that was I was gonna write I was gonna write machine gun because for me where the tactics sort of solidified where you can say yep these things hold up it's you gotta have the machine gun that's where we start to get the modern machine gun where we can start to kill a lot of people and how concentration is like the war the worst thing and just right covered move becomes totally important and it's it's important in all areas but it really starts to solidify around there well you use the example of like on steroids of nuclear weapons you know it's on my dispersion you know versus concentration with nuclear weapons I thought of another one just as I was thinking of this is hold the line jacos is hold the line like cool got it If we've got a company and our company's object or our vision, our goal is to be the premier hardware producer for a product that every company the world needs for them to be successful and then I've got a sales team inside there and nobody's saying, well sales is like the most important thing we have, we got to sell this thing, it's the military version for this company and you're out there running the sales team and your objective is sell as many of these things as you can because that's obviously how we become the indispensable producer of this product that everybody's going to need and be the most reputable and reliable company in the world. Once I see now it's one of several different ways and when you made that comment about the military is existance like the ideal thing you would think for the military is I want this military to exist to deter any potential opponent from ever going to war with us in terms of like what would I want from my military? and and you can kind of see I mean what's there's another good saying it's something along the lines of like old men like to send young men to fight young men like to go fight like that's kind of a thing and I guess that's where we end up with these two kind of opposing theories of war and who wants to be called the wimp who wants to be called the weak right because that's what you could easily go back to be actually a heart and say like well he wants to run away he wants to you know attack people from the rear there's a time where attacking someone the rear shoot him in the back was like a horrible thing and I'm just using that one example of trying to be going from this book of like a great way of like I'm care like dude that that is not what he meant I know that's what it says on people If you want to hear some other topics that are adjacent to yet not fully embedded with Jockel podcast topics, but look, even though I think about leadership 20 hours a day, there's other things I think about like psychology, like sociology, like questions, do answering questions from people. So this is a, again, there's very few people that would think that the military mind should focus on hey, I might have to adjust what I'm trying to get to because it seems like the military is more, you know, like we're going to get this done. It's almost a means in and of itself as if the military exists for the military as opposed to this is a tool, one of many tools that actually accomplishes the political means which and to just kind of bring that back a little bit when he talked about the object being a greater piece or a better piece or whatever the term that you use and it's funny because I think I've evolved in my thinking when I hear objective I don't think bridge anymore, I don't think airfield anymore, I think goals I think outcome. I don't I don't get the advanced copy you don't like say Dave we're prepping this I get to hear this and I I'm thinking and I'm trying to analyzing I'm making connections and correlations and and I've kind of just been chuckling a little bit of like hard is just hammering clouds wits but he it's almost like I understand more now of why he's so brutal on the attack of him when he made that connection of he's the reason why we had generals and I think he used the word blunders which is about as nice as you can describe what those leaders did in order one Is it like, do you feel like it's maybe like, because it's like you say glorify, you know, never quit that, yeah, that never quit. The relevance of class was in the 21st century you know start talking about you know like nuclear power nuclear weapon stealth airplanes and things like hey do these maximums of these do these do they hold up to the scrutiny of the 21st century of warfare the modern warfare and a bunch of discussions on that. yeah is that what's going on your coward he's like hey bro I win wounded three times and gasped almost the death you fucking savages and you don't know what that was like you talk about how many times this has come up this the capacity for the dehumanization of our enemies and how there's a danger in there and there's there's a natural piece of that I've seen countless leaders think that they know the way and want to do something a certain way and waste time and effort and resources and most important waste leadership capital to get something done a certain way when my attitude is like, I don't care. But if you're out there selling this product and it hasn't been made yet because our operations team has been stood up or you're selling this and we don't have the support for the clients that are going to buy it to actually give them the tools that need or you're selling this and we don't have the software to update it and back it up, you can actually accomplish your objective by selling this product that doesn't help us achieve the object that doesn't actually help us be successful and I'm not defending cost-wits but there is the military is somebody's car I don't know that's all good. That's what I'm saying, where they oversimplify it, where they have all these cool things like, you know, if they fit first, you don't succeed, you know, try again or you know, all these things. You know, people seem to like and seem saying, I got to admit when I learned the master and I saw some people that had, you know, shirt locker shirts on totally represent extra level of connection.
