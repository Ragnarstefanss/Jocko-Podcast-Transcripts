but if but we do need to have contingency planning if you want to get in the game if you want to support the underground that will be appreciated and and in order like when we do that in order we got to give something you know to kind of show our appreciation we'll do some things on the underground to you know show our appreciation now maybe some additional sort of podcast things maybe some podcasts that don't fit in the typical format of a usual jockel podcast because that's one thing that you know I think of that the I try might maintain a consistency with the jockel podcast that when you press play you kind of know what you're getting or at least have some idea so for me to throw something that's you know really uh maybe a lot shorter maybe it's a different subject matter maybe it's some kind of current event space thing whatever I don't know Like even like, I can think for an example strangely, but you know, like I was saying, like you'll have it, like, oh, yeah, you're, okay, these are all swear words, so I don't want to do that example, but you can be like, oh, and I'm telling you put your donut down tell me get out of bed tell me why did do it when to help you achieve what you want to achieve you don't you don't feel like it flip side canvas stuff you can hang on your wall some people would say art I would say graphic visual representations of the path of justice got a bunch of books a bunch of books about face leadership strategy and tactics discipline equals freedom field manual brand new version you can probably get that one for you know somebody that you know that could you was a little just a little adjustment in life maybe it's the kind of person maybe it's the kind of person that right now they could use some help maybe when they wake up in the morning instead of having a routine where they take the supplements they're supposed to take maybe they could just figure out through this book they could find the discipline that it takes to put a bottle next to their toothbrush and take it thank you jacko anyways you can check out that book this week was freedom field manual way the warrior could four field manuals out way the warrior could one two three mic in the dragons extreme ownership that caught me leadership we got that's the front which is leadership consultancy we saw problems to leadership go to echelon front dot com for details on that we got eF online yeah really crazy to me that this is not a big like thing that you could just do with the bottles next to your teeth bro you know what it is no this is this is really what it is now that I'm like analyzing my whole mind because you're right you're like we know it like helps you so much so like dude you're getting wrapped around the fact that you have a computer programming mind and you want to take the English language and put it into a totally formatted system this doesn't again again if it's across the board you know why it doesn't work I'll tell you why it doesn't work it's like you did to languages like the English languages like you did to words come into it and they get adapted into it if they're good if they work if they don't then they get to shut down And I hope anyway, because man, if you're doing like a, like a history true false, like that's way more dangerous because of like how much nuance or in perspective, like, if you got, okay, so my daughter will ask me questions and I'll always answer yeah t-shirt club check that up if you want boom on joclostard dot com also subscribe to the podcast we got a the platforms that were on like I said they they've been good to us let's hope they stay that way subscribe to it check it out we also got we got this podcast we got the jockel unraveling podcast we got grounded podcast we got the warrior kid podcast we got a youtube channel where echo does excessive amounts of CGI and uncanny fakes or what would you say uncanny valley yeah he was doing little kids like the kettlebell swings don't back you know I don't want them to quite do my daughter does them or wants to do them whatever I don't I don't know I don't need her like sleeping and bashing her shin with that little kettle I don't know anyway burpees I got it so a little bit it's good a lot of it so a little bit of language control inside your own family with your children trying to explain to them basic things like a binary decision making process between good and bad in an immediate way right is it's a positive thing kind of influence their thoughts first sure got it across the board maybe not just remind me not to let you become dictator we've run that game on the whole country yeah fully a lot of stuff again in teeny tiny doses or use just like sparingly it's like it's good thing like salt really put a little bit of salt on touch it's pretty nice so maybe if depending on how many people get let's say this the first three people that get it will be rewarded but that way you know look a little bit of a little bit of a cost for freedom that way we can invest in all these different things we want to do and by the way if you're freaked out or you're like ah money grab and And like I remembered like this really good movie, you know, like space aliens. but the only way to not think about your joints hurting or hurting in the future is to through discipline take them every day see now you're like that guy that's you know given advice about something they're not actually doing yeah kind of just that I'll give you advice hey take them every day there you go I don't know that I say take it every day she's got a charity organization and if you want to donate or get involved check out america's mighty warriors dot org and if you want to bring some dystopian future into your present day we got you covered you can get more of my despondent diet tribes or you can get more of echoes dysoriented differentiations you can find us on the interwebs and we definitely got some dysoriented differentiations from you today definitely and you can find us on the interwebs on turn on instagram which you know echo only refers to ads the gram and on echo is adequate Charles i am at jockel milk and thanks to all the military people out there in the world that fight against tyranny and oppression every single day and keep us free and thanks to police and law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret service all first responders for being there when we aren't in our time of need and to everyone else out there don't take freedom for granted and countless sacrifices have been made to secure freedom and to preserve it and if we have to preserve so so my daughter was there and she was like talking about like how her like because she went to that running thing what her leg is all sore and all the stuff me while my son he's over getting after it or I always felt like I had a little bit of better, you know, because maybe I wasn't, you know, when we're talking, we're talking, you know, teenage years. so so what we set up what echo is set up because pretty much I didn't do anything besides like say we better do this just in case and echo said Roger that so a separate un underground a podcast feed that's underground right separate underground forum a separate underground kind of way to communicate to us and listen this podcast that we're doing right here the jockel podcast this will remain free and available to all for as long as it is allowed to be free in a web I will never change that by my own volition and believe me we have had opportunity upon opportunity to do that to go behind the fire wall pay well the pay wall and we haven't done that and we won't do that so as long as this as long as we're allowed to do this we'll do it You know, don't say whatever, say that, you know, they like they tell you the actual word for a fair, like don't say. It's like obviously millions of examples, but like you have analog and digital, like even if you go film, right? and we appreciate it there's also you know talking some other friends right now that have other podcasts about you know given them the same kind of bringing them into the fold and that's what we're at and like I said I hope it doesn't come to a point where you need to go full death core underground
