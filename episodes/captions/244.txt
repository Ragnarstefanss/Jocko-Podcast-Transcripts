[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 244 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:06] echo. Good evening. And also joining me tonight is Mike Sarelli and George Randall.
[00:00:11] And if you haven't listened to, when Mike came on the podcast for the first time, go listen to that.
[00:00:18] It was number 134. Mike was in task in the bruiser in the battle of the body. And after that,
[00:00:27] he did another nine combat deployments. And he is part of our leadership consultancy,
[00:00:34] echelon front, where he also heads up our talent acquisition firm, which is called EF overwatch.
[00:00:42] Mike, welcome back. And also George Randall, is an army vet, came up through the ranks from
[00:00:50] enlisted to officer, which I guess we all have that in common. And then left the army for the
[00:00:56] corporate world, where eventually we became a talent acquisition executive. That sounds impressive.
[00:01:05] Always keeping a focus on recruiting veterans and coaching them through the transition
[00:01:10] to civilian life. Now there's all kinds of things we could talk about. But today we're going
[00:01:15] to focus on, well, it's been one of the focuses that we've had for several years at echelon front.
[00:01:21] And it's a focus that you guys have taken and absolutely run with. And that is talent.
[00:01:28] It is finding, recruiting, acquiring and retaining the best people.
[00:01:36] Obviously, all those things are a subset of leadership. But it's a subset that both of you have
[00:01:42] been focused on. And it's a subset that gets left out a lot in people ignore it. And
[00:01:50] Mike, you, you, you started GFO Overwatch. And you guys got so possessed by this that you guys have
[00:01:58] just written a book. And the book is called The Talent War. And you've done a great job of
[00:02:09] covering, you know, this topic in the book. And I want to jump into it. And I'm going to do something
[00:02:12] right now that might be considered lame. I don't know. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm going to start
[00:02:18] with a quote from the book. But the quote that I'm going to start with from the book is a quote from me,
[00:02:26] because I wrote the forward. So maybe that's lame. But here it is. Leadership is the most important
[00:02:31] thing on the battlefield. And the most important thing in business and in life. It is leadership that
[00:02:37] sets the example. It is leadership that makes decisions. It is leadership that unifies a team around
[00:02:43] a common goal. And it is leadership that takes care of the team and gets the mission done. But
[00:02:48] one of the most important roles of the leader is often overlooked. The responsibility of building
[00:02:56] the team in the first place. The leader is responsible for training, equipping, and directing a team.
[00:03:04] But before any of that is possible, the leader must recruit, screen, and acquire the right people
[00:03:11] for the team. And that's a little bit from the forward. And then it jumps into this book that you
[00:03:20] guys wrote. Before we jump into it, at what point did you start thinking that that we needed
[00:03:28] right about this, that we needed to do something about this? Were you thinking about this as you
[00:03:32] stood up, EFO Overwatch? As you guys started banging your heads together and moving forward with this,
[00:03:37] Mike, at what point did you start looking at, hey, we need to start telling people about talent
[00:03:43] and how they need to handle it as leaders? You know, I love how you just said it's a subset of
[00:03:48] leadership. But absolutely, as you just said, it's one of the most overlooked parts is before you even
[00:03:53] step out on an adventure. You got to formulate the team. And that's hard. And really,
[00:04:01] Georgia and I nerd out on this, where other people are talking about, you know, just you too.
[00:04:05] We're talking about talent acquisition. And if anyone calls me and nerd, I'll gladly provide
[00:04:11] my address. You can come out of a conversation with me. No, I'm joking. So the amount of companies
[00:04:17] we run into that reach out to us and say, hey, we need help. And, you know, we're very genuine.
[00:04:22] We want to see our clients succeed. That's our primary goal. We also want to see our candidates
[00:04:27] you know, prosper in those positions that we place them in. But they are at a loss
[00:04:36] for what the correct steps are. And as we looked at it, it sort of out of frustration of wanting
[00:04:42] to help them and them not always following our guidance, we during our conversations, we talked about
[00:04:48] a lot about the special operations community and how it's taking them decades to create a world
[00:04:54] class talent acquisition process. Do they call it something different? It's not hiring. We call
[00:05:00] assessment and insolention. And so one day, I, you know, usually how I carry out my ideas. I was
[00:05:07] probably watching TV and something came in my head. I picked up the phone called Jordan said, hey,
[00:05:11] we should write a book on this. And he said, okay. And then we started researching it. You know,
[00:05:15] we didn't think all the way through it. You know, most of my ideas are half baked. And, you know,
[00:05:21] voila, we found somebody to assist us through the process because neither of us had written a book.
[00:05:28] I knew two guys at Roto Book, I didn't reach out to him, which was probably the biggest mistake.
[00:05:32] And we're learning a lot of that. The hard way, but this journey has been awesome. And it's
[00:05:40] actually solidified and changed some of the views we have on talent going through this process and
[00:05:45] all the interviews. So George, how did you two link up? Well, it was funny. I was actually listening
[00:05:51] to podcast 134. And so I'm listening to this. And then you all mentioned, you have overwatch
[00:05:58] in Austin. I'm like, you got to be kidding me. So I reached out to Mike Unlinkedin and I said, hey,
[00:06:04] you know what? We need some world class leaders where I work. You know, and he wrote back
[00:06:09] within minutes. And the next thing, you know, where it breakfast at Kirby Lane in Austin. And,
[00:06:14] you know, it was like, wow, I found my counterpart. I got somebody who thinks about talent like I do.
[00:06:22] And it rapidly took off from there. You know, ultimately leading to the wedding, which at some point
[00:06:29] we might talk about. I didn't marry George. Let's just, there was no wedding. I'll let him continue.
[00:06:34] He asked I was already spoken for. So, but yeah, and we just really started to think, okay,
[00:06:41] how do we pair up my 20 years in talent acquisition in his 20 years in special operations? And
[00:06:47] there was just so much synergy there in an instant. And we were fortunate to see it and take off with it.
[00:06:54] Yeah, you know, from when Mike originally started talking to me and and late about, you know,
[00:06:59] doing something with talent acquisition for people, it was such a no-brainer because all of these
[00:07:04] companies we work with. We got to work with the company. We spent two days with them. And at the end,
[00:07:08] you know what they say? They say, we would really love to have a couple people with your backgrounds.
[00:07:13] Or, you know, do you know what we can find people? We were getting, we heard that for years and years
[00:07:17] and years. Where can we get people that have this mindset, this leadership skill set? Where do we find them?
[00:07:22] And you know, Nathan, I would kind of struggle as well. You can try and hire vets or whatever.
[00:07:26] And then when Mike got on board and, you know, he just said, hey, we can actually do this because
[00:07:31] your background with vetted. And it was, it was just such an obvious answer to help the clients that we
[00:07:38] have at Escalafron be able to get good people. And on top of that, take veterans that are coming
[00:07:45] out that have been institutionalized because I don't know if a better way to describe it because
[00:07:49] I know I was damn sure institutionalized. You know, I spent my entire adult life in the
[00:07:52] sealed teams had no idea. I'll tell people people would be like, you know, when you started
[00:07:57] teaching leadership, like, how did you know it was going to work in the civilian world? I didn't,
[00:08:02] I didn't. The first time I sat down with the CEO and I was talking to them, I had no idea
[00:08:05] that almost never mind, almost that that line for line, the leadership that we talked to seals
[00:08:14] was the exact same leadership that was needed in a company or in a team. And as soon as I realized
[00:08:20] that, I said, we've got something very special here because we had distilled it down and it
[00:08:24] made so much sense and he had been tested. As soon as got out in the civilian sector, same thing.
[00:08:29] So when Mike started saying, hey, we could actually help the military folks and help the civilian
[00:08:37] companies. I mean, this is just a win, win across the board. You know, you've got both sides
[00:08:43] of the equation that absolutely benefit from doing this math and it doesn't get any better than that.
[00:08:50] So to actually now jump into the book a little bit, kicks this off in chapter one,
[00:08:58] you can't see talent. A Navy seal instructor told Dr. Josh Cotton. Tell me about Josh Cotton
[00:09:04] before I think in here. So Josh is our counterpart, help with right the book. Josh and I connected
[00:09:10] through multiple, multiple contacts of Josh's story is interesting. You know, you think Werner
[00:09:16] Josh is the ultimate nerd and I give him a crap for that. He loves data. He's an industrial
[00:09:21] organization on psychologist. Well, when he was finishing his doctorate, he worked with the Navy
[00:09:27] out of Millington and eventually a contract came along where which was offered to him to work with
[00:09:32] the Navy seals to assess how they assess and select talent into their community. So he also worked
[00:09:40] with a little bit with the Mars community, the Arnold Army Special Operations Special Forces Community
[00:09:46] and he gained experience that most doctors, I know, had a close psychologist, don't receive.
[00:09:52] And then he took what he found based off assessing high performers, which arguably,
[00:09:56] to special operations community is a bunch of high performers and how do you apply that to a business
[00:10:02] setting? And it resonated extremely well. So as he stepped out of that contract, he stepped into the
[00:10:07] Fortune 500 right now. You know, he's the director of talent assessments for a major Fortune
[00:10:13] 500 company throughout the organization. And so he's, you know, he's looking at all this data
[00:10:21] at performers at different levels of the organization. And that's where he came into the book.
[00:10:25] You know what that reminds me of. So at some point, I was talking to one of the guys that worked
[00:10:33] at Buds as a civilian contractor, as what's the real word for an athletic trainer? Is it just
[00:10:38] called an athletic trainer? Is that what it is? Is that the job, especially someone that
[00:10:41] looks at your spring, Dankel or whatever? Is that what it is? Echo Charles? Trainer? Yeah.
[00:10:45] Trainer? So I was talking to one of those guys and he was talking about
[00:10:51] Patella for moral syndrome. So Patella for moral syndrome is this thing that you can get. And it's
[00:10:57] where you're, you're, you're Patella, somehow, rubs against your, your femur or you're a
[00:11:05] Patella tendon, rubs against your femur and it gets sore and swollen, right? And he said, you know,
[00:11:11] in the civilian world at a football team, at a baseball team, at a college football team, whatever,
[00:11:15] he says, you might see a case of Patella for moral syndrome. You might see three in a season.
[00:11:24] He said, I see seven cases of Patella for moral syndrome, a date at Buds. So what I'm saying is,
[00:11:33] you take this doctor that's used to looking at whatever, the assessment of some
[00:11:37] civilian organization, we're going to assess some candidates and, you know, see what,
[00:11:41] see where they're at and see where that mentally and see where that psychologically and
[00:11:44] you have to wait for months and months to see how they actually perform when do they get put
[00:11:48] under pressure at Buds? It's like, oh, here you go, here's a, here's a 180 people that are
[00:11:55] about to get the biggest mental stress of their life in the next four weeks and you get to look at.
[00:12:01] That's, that's, that's an amazing way to get to get experience. And that's what happened with these
[00:12:05] guys that would, would athletic trainers. And it was a couple different approaches that guys would
[00:12:09] have. Some guys would, they would leave like a pro sports team and and come to Buds and they
[00:12:15] would never want to leave because they were so, so much help or they'd come and get all that
[00:12:20] experience and then they'd go to a team because, you know, after you've seen hundreds of cases of
[00:12:26] Patella for moral syndrome and ITB issues and whatever, all those little injuries that they deal
[00:12:32] with all the time, they show up at a baseball team, they can identify things so much easier than
[00:12:36] anybody else could. And so that's what it sounds like. This, this doctor cotton is. And to take
[00:12:41] it one step further following that experience, he created something completely based off special
[00:12:46] operations and how we classify, you know, high performers, it's called the elite performance
[00:12:51] indicator of the EPI and he developed that personal assessment tool, which is now used by business
[00:12:58] is and what we're going to be using sort of is our indexes, just one of many assessments of our
[00:13:04] candidates for the EFO watch candidates that come to us from the military.
[00:13:08] Bud, yeah. All right. So now that we've got Dr. Josh cotton, we know about him and so I'll
[00:13:13] take it from the top. You can't see talent. A Navy SEAL instructor told Dr. Josh cotton,
[00:13:18] it's not the biggest guy or the strongest or the fastest. You have to trust the process.
[00:13:23] The process will reveal who has the potential to become a SEAL. Dr. Cotton was working with
[00:13:28] the Navy SEAL community to improve their assessment and selection process. To that end,
[00:13:32] he'd been asking all the instructors what do you look for in recruits. He had received a lot of
[00:13:37] insightful answers. People who don't quit, team players who step up and lead, resiliency, people who
[00:13:42] are calm under pressure, problem solvers. This was the first instructor who had taken their question
[00:13:47] literally, but it was a good answer because you can't inherently see talent, not in somebody's physical
[00:13:53] appearance and especially not on their resume. Now we go into this little case study, which is
[00:14:00] interesting about this is people ask me, you know, like who's going to meet you? You think that
[00:14:04] guy is going to make it? I've said, I have no idea because you can't tell. In fact, there was a guy
[00:14:12] who was a captain and a great guy and he had never signed anyone off and said, this guy is going to
[00:14:20] make it and he eventually got this candidate through whatever relationships he had, this candidate
[00:14:27] came out, this guy was like a multi-language really diverse background, seemed like he had a bunch of
[00:14:33] bunch of experience highly educated and he signed off on the guy and this is the one guy he signed off
[00:14:40] of to be an officer in the sealed teams and the guy quit and he said, I'll never sign off and he
[00:14:45] interviewed him. The whole line you had to go to the captain in the sealed teams. Signed off
[00:14:49] on the guy, he quit, he said, I'll never sign off on anyone again. Now let's be honest, just
[00:14:54] and start that way. When it was 25 year old, Jocca, you were like hey, that guy, as you watch all
[00:14:58] of it, but I can't at lines up y'all. He played football in a D1 school, he's going to make it,
[00:15:04] or any of that kid that did speech into debate, he's going to be gone within the first two weeks,
[00:15:08] dude, in fact you say life humbles you, you still be learning, you don't know, you don't even
[00:15:13] have to go to 25 year old, you're Jocca, you can go to 19 years old, as I'm watching guys that were
[00:15:19] infinitely better qualified and you know, athletically more talented than me and I'm watching them
[00:15:25] quit and I was like okay, I guess there's no telling who's going to get through this program
[00:15:30] and speaking of which is the way you get to. Going back to the book, Mike embarrassly learned
[00:15:36] this lesson firsthand when he was a student at going through Naval Special Warfare under water
[00:15:40] demolition seal training, but Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine and by the way I'm talking
[00:15:47] about Mike, Mike's really sitting right here. Mike was a prior-listed recon Marine, one of the
[00:15:51] Marine Corps Special Operation capable forces which later became an official part of the Special
[00:15:54] Operations Community in 2006 and Scouts Kniver in May of 2003, he was discharged as a sergeant
[00:15:59] and commissioned as a Naval Officer and issued immediate orders to buds the Marines at taught him how
[00:16:04] to lead a team and he foolishly and arrogantly believed that his natural, that this naturally led
[00:16:09] to the ability to determine which candidates would make great seals and which candidates didn't
[00:16:13] deserve to be there. His six months in buds would be a brutal lesson in humility on how wrong he
[00:16:19] was and his ideas about evaluating candidates. How could he be in a position to determine who would
[00:16:24] make great special operations soldier when he was competing for the very honor the other students
[00:16:29] we're striving for. In this class Mike made the same class mistake that every business leader or
[00:16:34] HR manager makes when they toss a resume into the trash because the candidate doesn't have the
[00:16:38] exact education or industry experience required. Like most hiring managers today he judged a book
[00:16:45] by its cover that book was Ryan Job. Ryan didn't look like a seal. He was on the heavier side
[00:16:52] for a seal at least and nobody knew how he'd make it through the initial how he'd made it through
[00:16:56] the initial physical standards to even get into buts. Mike looked at Ryan and he made a snap
[00:17:01] judgment. This guy's not going to make it he thought. Mike wasn't the only one who thought so.
[00:17:06] The rest of the class and the seal instructors all thought Ryan didn't fit the mold of the seal.
[00:17:11] Since everybody expected Ryan to quit the instructors decided to speed the process along.
[00:17:17] They threw everything they could at Ryan with within ethical and legal means of course
[00:17:23] interesting note you made there. Of course interesting of course it was within ethical and legal
[00:17:27] means buts is already among the most intensive physical and mental training a person can endure
[00:17:32] and it was even harder for Ryan. The instructors made him run extra miles and do more pushups.
[00:17:36] They forced him to be called let in Sandy longer than the rest of the students. By the end of
[00:17:39] hell week approximately two months in retraining the class had gone from 250 students down to 35.
[00:17:44] Recruit after recruit rang the bell three times signifying a DOR drop on request or
[00:17:49] laments term they quit. Only 35 guys were left and Mike was one of them. He felt he was truly
[00:17:55] part of an elite organization a brotherhood as he looked down the line of the physical
[00:18:00] beast standing alongside him. He was astonished. A few candidates to his left stood none other than
[00:18:06] Ryan Job who was smiling. Mike and Ryan both reported to seal team three they eventually
[00:18:14] deployed to Ramadi. I rack where they fought in the battle of Ramadi in 2006 one of the fiercest
[00:18:18] battles in the global war on terror. Ryan performed as an automatic weapons machine gunner during
[00:18:22] the days in Ramadi. After months of fierce fighting Ryan was critically wounded during a major
[00:18:27] operation in South Central Ramadi contested area held by alkai to forces. You shot in the face
[00:18:33] by a sniper while laying down machine gun fire to cover a squad of seals closing on the enemy.
[00:18:39] Days after Ryan was wounded doctors declared he would never recover his sight.
[00:18:44] In salt to injury he also lost his sense of smell and taste but it didn't slow him down.
[00:18:49] After his injury Ryan displayed the same drive and resiliency he demonstrated during his days at
[00:18:54] buds. He refused to quit or feel sorry for himself. Despite all the setbacks he finished his
[00:18:59] bachelor's in business with a 4.0 GPA he ascended the 14,411 feet of Mount Ranier and even shot
[00:19:07] a and killed a trophy bull elk. All this without his sight, smell or taste.
[00:19:14] Ryan underwent countless surgeries and rehabilitation in years after Ramadi. In 2009 only a few
[00:19:20] weeks after he found out he and his wife his high school sweetheart would be having a baby. He
[00:19:25] aspirated and died during his 22nd surgery for his injuries. He became what seals call the last
[00:19:33] fatality of the battle of Ramadi. He was the third seal from his task unit to die.
[00:19:40] Fellow seal Mark Lee was the first and the second Michael Montsourer who was awarded the
[00:19:45] Medal of Honor for jumping on a grenade to save two seals, one of which was Mike Surelli.
[00:19:53] It's hard for Mike to believe now that he ever doubted Ryan. He was always waiting for a time to
[00:19:59] apologize and he found that time while they were in Ramadi. While they were in Ramadi.
[00:20:04] After Mike apologized Ryan said it's okay everyone's been misreading me all my life.
[00:20:21] So I don't know if there's a better example of why we can't judge a book by its cover than Ryan.
[00:20:30] He ended up rolling into Charlie Patoon and tasked him to bruise her and he got some personal
[00:20:42] love and encouragement from his Patumates to make sure that he was going to be an awesome seal.
[00:20:50] But this is a metaphor for what you guys see in the civilian sector with people looking at
[00:20:59] resumes and judging books by its cover. Same thing.
[00:21:05] Every day, thousands upon thousands of resumes coming in, managers like,
[00:21:11] this guy's been in our competitor, this person's done ABC, they have all these experience.
[00:21:16] Yeah, got to hire him right away. No process. I just know it. Got call.
[00:21:23] When everyone's talking to companies and I'll, a common question is what, what question should
[00:21:30] you ask during an interview? It's a pretty common question or what assessment or what should we do?
[00:21:35] How should we screen and I'm always saying, hey look, try and put the person in a position
[00:21:42] or a situation that's as similar as they're going to be working in because that's the best way to
[00:21:46] assess if they're going to be able to do it or not. It's a similar thing that they're doing now.
[00:21:50] You know, for years, they're trying to figure out who is going to make it through seal training.
[00:21:55] And now what they do is they send them to what is I think it's Chicago. They send them
[00:21:59] Chicago and they go through a pre-training situation where what they do is basically freaking train
[00:22:07] really, really hard and a bunch of people don't make it through that but then they find that, oh yeah,
[00:22:12] more people that made it through that are going to make it through actual buds. Well, it's like,
[00:22:17] does that not true? I've got to look at the numbers. I don't think it was a substantial increase
[00:22:22] in the number that actually made it through buds. But again, we've got to go back and look at the
[00:22:26] data. But it's the same thing with Dr. Cotton. And we see this with people who build assessments.
[00:22:31] We've even, it's funny you brought up trainers for the screening for Jay Sock. There were physical
[00:22:36] trainers that believed they could give you an 80% sort of answer on whether somebody was going to
[00:22:44] make it through the training or not. Everyone claims, oh well, my personal assessment test will
[00:22:47] give you 80% probability of whether a person will make it through the training. And it's all wrong.
[00:22:53] That's what's the perfect question we need to answer in the interview. We hear that all the time.
[00:22:58] There is no one perfect. There's no one perfect personal assessment. Some people like the
[00:23:03] Hogan, other people like the disc. And what you're not going to find in this book is it's not
[00:23:08] prescriptive. So I can be like, okay, step one. This is what you do. Step two, these are the questions
[00:23:13] that you need to ask. These are the personal assessments that you use. It's different for every company.
[00:23:18] What it is, you've got to identify your process. What's the process that works for you that
[00:23:24] results in statistically the most quality hiders? And that is a, as you know, that is a decade long
[00:23:33] pursuit and it's taking special operations. There's still redo. There's still constantly evolving
[00:23:38] the process. 50 decades and they're still evolving that process. So yeah, you know, we hear it all
[00:23:44] the time and somebody says this is the number one question I asked that determines whether somebody's
[00:23:48] going to work at the company or not. And if that works, we're not here to judge that's great.
[00:23:53] You know, we get people coming to us all the time saying, what are those questions? And I kind of
[00:23:58] kind of off. Like, do you know what success looks like in your company? Yeah. They're already starting
[00:24:04] down the interview path before they've determined what success looks like. What they're even looking
[00:24:08] for. Exactly. What gaps do we have? What are we trying to do here? You know, and you know,
[00:24:13] when I was coaching veterans and you know, Mike and I do this webinar. And I said, can any of you
[00:24:18] tell me a time where you've left the wire and didn't clearly know what success looked like?
[00:24:24] But do you watch people walk into the hiring process all the time? And they're like, okay,
[00:24:29] here's a list of objective requirements. I want them to come from these companies. Okay, let's
[00:24:33] figure out the interview questions. Yeah. Like you have a literally backwards. Yeah. So I guess this
[00:24:39] is going back to what I was originally starting to say that I got sidetracked on. So when I asked
[00:24:43] companies or people asked me, what's the question you ask? I always asked the group a question.
[00:24:48] I'll say, who here has ever hired someone that did the best interview. It was outstanding. You
[00:24:54] thought this guy was a rock star. You bring along board and they're told to disaster. And
[00:25:00] 100% of time every single person will raise their hand because everyone has done that. We, this guy
[00:25:04] interviewed great, super-carol. She was terrific in the interview. All charismatic. They do a great job
[00:25:09] in the interview and they're duds when they show up to work. And then I asked the opposing question,
[00:25:14] which is, who here has looked, you needed to fill a sea, you took a risk on somebody. You
[00:25:19] weren't really sure it would work out. They got in there and they crushed it. And the same thing,
[00:25:24] everyone raises their hand. So it's a common problem and it's a common problem that we all have
[00:25:32] where we think we know better than life. Yeah. And I got to tell you, you know, I've been doing
[00:25:39] this 20 plus years and, you know, I worked for Fortune 50 Company one year. My team hired the team
[00:25:45] that I led hired 23,000 people in one year. So I can say from a scale perspective that I probably
[00:25:52] hired the more people than most on the planet. And I promise you, I've got to trust the process.
[00:25:59] There's no part of me that goes, oh yeah, I got that down. I know that person, yeah, they're going to
[00:26:03] rock it. No, no, that process. If you don't have a process and if you haven't defined success,
[00:26:08] hiring will humble you. You know, and you've got to approach it. And you know, one of the things
[00:26:13] that Mike and I went to great lengths about in this book was no process is perfect. And it's,
[00:26:20] you know, and one of the big things where you're talking with Josh was, you know, how do you know
[00:26:26] when you're doing it wrong? How do you get a feedback loop? And people just do hiring is something
[00:26:31] mechanical. And they don't think about this. Oh, we got to go do this. So it's outsourced and
[00:26:35] your HR is just okay, they're turning the cranks. And they're bringing people in the door. They're
[00:26:39] funneling through resumes. Yeah. But even with my years of experience, you know, you know, I'm always
[00:26:45] questioning myself. What am I missing? What have I missing? Did I get this right? Did I evaluate all the
[00:26:49] right traits for success in this role? And you know, I'm still going to miss. And I'll get humbled by it
[00:26:55] real quick. Every time I think I'm confident, Murphy's Law comes around and then humbles me click.
[00:27:00] It's an art. It's an art. There's a science behind it, but ultimately much like you can study war
[00:27:08] in the United States and train for a decade. But until you step into the arena of war,
[00:27:14] you really don't hone that art. And so you're going to make mistakes. If you have a process
[00:27:20] when we see the bad hires happen is when people deviate from that process and they put a time
[00:27:26] women on it. And we're not taking it. We're not telling anyone that you're going to take six months to
[00:27:30] interview somebody to hire for the job. No, we understand that it has to be within reasonable time
[00:27:34] on it. But you know, I know we're probably going to get to this. You can have the greatest,
[00:27:41] world's best talent acquisition process. You can have a great process. But if you don't have
[00:27:49] your leadership foundation, if it's not solid within the organization, you're going to become
[00:27:53] a revolving door for talent. You're going to get great people into the company and once they recognize
[00:27:58] that there's bad leadership, they're going to leave. So funny enough, this book, and you know,
[00:28:02] it's a subset. It's an important part of leadership. You actually have to start with your leadership
[00:28:06] foundation before you even start to build a good hiring process. And that's where a lot of people
[00:28:11] get it wrong. What we're lacking talent, let's just get good talent and good talent will come in.
[00:28:15] And again, if you're working for a bad later, that person's going to leave. What do we always say?
[00:28:19] You select a boss. Not a job. You select a great boss. Yeah. You say something in here too.
[00:28:26] It's the same thing that you're saying. It will get to it later. But if you're hiring good people,
[00:28:31] they don't put up with knuckleheads. They don't want to work for a knucklehead. So if you go on
[00:28:36] you hire someone that's awesome and you're a knucklehead or your leadership is a bunch of knuckleheads,
[00:28:40] they're not going to stay there. That's just the way it works. And the other thing is, you know,
[00:28:44] there's, you're not just like combat, you're not going to eliminate all risk when you make a
[00:28:49] hire. I mean, there's always going to be some level of risk there. But what you can do, if you
[00:28:54] set up the right process is mitigate that risk as much as humanly possible. And then you end up
[00:29:00] in a much better situation. Getting back to the book because damn, apparently we can all get sidetracked
[00:29:06] pretty quick. I guess I can nerd out on talent too, huh? A little bit. You go into this section of
[00:29:11] what is talent. At the most basic level talent equals high potential candidates. The people most
[00:29:16] likely to become high performers. Talent is people like Ryan Job. It is the individual who never
[00:29:21] gives up who performs in high pressure situations and who will win when others say it's impossible.
[00:29:27] Talent drives the team forward and talent wins. And I'm skipping forward, which, by the way,
[00:29:36] if this book, when I read it seems a little bit fragmented, just because I'm not reading the whole
[00:29:40] thing, you have to buy the book to get all the information. But I'm going to skip ahead here.
[00:29:45] Based on our research and interviews, we have identified nine core characteristics that
[00:29:49] mark an individual as having high potential. Drive. The unrelenting need for achievement and
[00:29:55] constant self improvement. Resiliency. The ability to persevere in the face of challenge and
[00:30:00] bounce back from setbacks. Adaptability. The ability to adjust according to the situation,
[00:30:05] learn new things, innovate and try new methods, humility. Self confidence in one's ability while
[00:30:11] understanding that there's always room for improvement and that others experiences and knowledge
[00:30:16] are valuable. Integrity and adherence to not only what is legal, but also what is right.
[00:30:24] Effective intelligence, the ability to apply one's knowledge to real world scenarios,
[00:30:29] team ability. The ability to function as part of a team placing the success of the whole above
[00:30:36] the needs of the self. Curiosity, a desire to explore the unknown and question the status quo
[00:30:43] in pursuit of better, more effective solutions. And the last one is emotional strength, a positive
[00:30:49] attitude, high empathy, and control over one's own emotions, especially in chaotic,
[00:30:54] stressful situations. These traits are heavily emphasized in special operations and explain
[00:31:01] why many veterans go on to accomplish incredible things in the business world after their military
[00:31:06] service. For instance, many companies including Johnson and Johnson with Alex Gorski FedEx,
[00:31:12] with Fred Smith, Bridgewater, David McCormick, and 711 Joe Depinto to name a few are run by veterans.
[00:31:17] These nine attributes are foundational to success no matter the industry. So when you say based on
[00:31:25] our research and interviews, is this stuff that Dr. Cotton kind of put forward or where do you
[00:31:31] guys come up with this? So it's combination of what Dr. Cotton sort of his discovery and then we
[00:31:36] also went and we interviewed people that ran the assessment selection for these different communities.
[00:31:41] Mar Sock, the Navy SEALs, the Green Berets. We worked with an amazing individual. His name is Brian Decker.
[00:31:47] He was a lieutenant colonel. He was in charge of the special forces assessment and selection
[00:31:53] process and actually sort of revolutionized it really around the concept of the whole man concept.
[00:31:58] And so each of these communities have a set of core attributes they're looking for. And it
[00:32:04] goes back really quickly. You did make a point about, you know, you hire somebody who interviews
[00:32:08] extremely well and they end up not working out. And that's what we call personality versus
[00:32:13] character. What you did was you hired based off personality and like ability and what is personality.
[00:32:18] That's really your external sort of show to the world where characters the inner
[00:32:25] attributes that drive your behaviors. And we say all fall in for that. It's like your customer facing
[00:32:31] self versus your internal facing self. Exactly. And you know one of the things we we talk about in the
[00:32:37] book is like the last thing you want to hire for. And then people get this, you know, this
[00:32:41] culture fit. Are they a culture fit? And it sort of becomes this just ad hoc term they throw out
[00:32:46] but they don't really understand. And when people say culture fit, a lot of times what they mean is
[00:32:52] do I like this person. And what we talk about in the book is that some of the the most high
[00:32:57] performing seals that I served with and you served with. I didn't like weird professionals and
[00:33:02] worked well together. But when the job was done he went and hung out with his inner circle and I
[00:33:06] went and hung with mine. But like ability for professionals is not a requirement. Now if you
[00:33:12] guys just conflict and it creates a toxic culture that's a different thing but the least important
[00:33:16] thing to me was like ability. If the individual performs and he can actually put his self needs
[00:33:22] a side or her self needs a side for the common good of the team that's somebody that can be part of
[00:33:27] the culture. As long as their values align with our culture. They're ethical. Yeah, I mean I think
[00:33:35] here's the deal on that from my perspective. If there's someone that works hard and is there to
[00:33:42] support the team, I like them. You know they like I don't know anyone that has here's the
[00:33:51] interesting. I know people that have good personalities and bad character they exist but I don't
[00:33:58] know of anyone. And so I might not like someone that has a good personality but you know and you
[00:34:02] can think when I think of these people I just think of famous people. There's all these famous people
[00:34:07] that they have these personalities and then they then all of a sudden the story breaks that they're
[00:34:11] told their backs. And whatever they've got to most heinous things going on in their personal lives.
[00:34:17] So you've got that where someone has a good personality they're they're forward facing
[00:34:22] personalities who are positive but then behind closed doors they're scumbags.
[00:34:26] And but if you flip that over I can't think of anybody that has a good character that they're
[00:34:33] a good character but they're a bad but they have a bad personality. I don't it's hard for me to think
[00:34:40] about. Now is there someone that maybe has a has a good character and there there maybe
[00:34:46] two director or maybe they're maybe they don't talk a lot or you know whatever but but normally
[00:34:51] if they've got a if they're he goes and check and they're they're gonna support the team.
[00:34:54] I mean I can't. Yeah it's pretty rare. Yeah but a better way but is there were people that were
[00:35:03] high performers that were just sort of socially awkward. So maybe they were just like they were too
[00:35:09] direct. Right. It burned sometimes bridges you understood their personality but other people didn't.
[00:35:15] Back to the attributes so Brian Decker is now the director of player development for the
[00:35:20] Indianapolis cults and so took what he learned in special forces assessment selection he's now
[00:35:25] applying it he's been in the NFL he's worked for for two teams for about six years.
[00:35:30] When they revolutionized and you know it pains me to say this but I can put my ego aside.
[00:35:36] The special forces army special forces community was much further ahead in terms of creating a
[00:35:43] structured and professionalized assessment of how they select special forces soldiers into the
[00:35:49] community. Seals it was just sort of this oral history passed down and when I went over there
[00:35:55] as a guest instructor at their phase two which is their small unit training that's when I was
[00:35:59] really exposed to their whole process and this thing called the whole man concept and the fact
[00:36:04] that they were looking for specific attributes. So when they redesigned their their assessment
[00:36:09] selection they created tasks much like an interview process where they're trying to elicit
[00:36:16] certain behaviors whether good or bad and that's what they're looking for. And so that translates
[00:36:21] to companies it doesn't matter you know what your interview process is or if you have written
[00:36:26] tests what you're trying to elicit with every every question should have meaning behind it
[00:36:32] in an interview process and ultimately that question has to drive at behaviors that's
[00:36:38] and people call this you know in the civilian world behavioral interviews. They're one of the best
[00:36:42] techniques if you do it well. Yeah the the German Army. Yeah as they were trying to get their
[00:36:51] their officers to step up and implement decentralized command and be able to make moves.
[00:36:58] One of the things that I've read about they would do is they would give them here's the rules
[00:37:02] that you have to follow for this training operation and the only way that they could actually
[00:37:07] successfully complete the mission would be to break the rules. And so it was a test to see if they
[00:37:13] would break the rules in order to accomplish the mission. And then there was and look even if
[00:37:18] if you didn't break the rules it didn't necessarily mean that you were a bad person. It just
[00:37:23] would now we know more about you right now I know more about you and we got into some of this on
[00:37:29] when it up at Gettysburg for you have battlefield. You know the fact that Lee didn't know his
[00:37:36] his two subordinates as well as he had before Jackson died. So he's talking to you all and he's
[00:37:43] telling you all that he wants to do something but he's not knowing well he doesn't know his personality
[00:37:47] well enough. So when he tells you hey take that thing if you can't take that hill if you can and
[00:37:52] you'll go to the other and says well I can't. He code of it just wouldn't have been a gut check.
[00:37:56] And if you would have told Jackson to take that hill Jackson would have taken that hill. So these
[00:38:02] are this idea behind setting up questions or situations or problems that you have to solve that
[00:38:09] reveal some part of your character is a very cool thing. You know when you mentioned earlier about
[00:38:16] when people come to you and ask what's the best interview question the question back to them is
[00:38:21] how are you screening for character. And it's one of the things we go into this book is that
[00:38:25] most of those questions are about experience. Do you have this objective experience? They're not
[00:38:33] screening for character. And so you know with the research that we did with Dr. Justin Cotton brought
[00:38:38] to us and when we figured these out you know our point is is that you know once you meet that simple
[00:38:45] experiential gate when you've got the basics you need to start screening for character and you go
[00:38:50] company by company by company and and I and I hate in some ways to say this because I see it all the time
[00:38:57] which is executives are almost the worst of this picking other executives and they don't screen
[00:39:03] for character they're looking for it. Did you work at the competition? How did you move the revenue?
[00:39:08] How did you improve customer success? How did you move a product along? They don't go down into
[00:39:13] character and I sat in the interview after interview after interview and it and it's all objective
[00:39:18] traits or you know basic subjective traits that don't go deep into character and that's what's missing.
[00:39:28] People will default to objective things because they're measurable. They're easy. It's the easy
[00:39:35] button. The subjective is what's hard. He talked about defining success. You know one of the
[00:39:41] mistakes we see with company students they just have one interview process across the organization.
[00:39:45] You actually have to create talent profiles for each of the roles and functions in levels of
[00:39:52] and that's why it takes a lot of time. So what's going to make a great engineer in a company
[00:39:58] is vastly different from what makes a great salesperson. So a lot of the times
[00:40:02] why companies don't define success and they're not good at the interview process is they haven't
[00:40:06] take the time to create talent profiles for the different levels and the different functions
[00:40:11] within the community. It's much like a seal. The attributes that make a great seal are vastly different
[00:40:17] than the attributes for special operations direct support in Intel officer or someone handling the logistics.
[00:40:24] And we've gotten smarter about that over the years as well. And what a lot of people don't understand
[00:40:28] is we're not only screening the green berets and the Navy seals or also screening the people
[00:40:33] that provide the support to those organizations that ultimately come under our umbrella. They're
[00:40:37] being screened for specific attributes as well. Think about the attributes of a good point man versus
[00:40:42] a good breacher. Right? This is like two guys in the same food but you know that breacher attitude
[00:40:48] versus a point man attitude. That's even those guys are a little bit different and they kind of
[00:40:53] get picked when you show up at the team. You know some little guy that's sneaky point man.
[00:40:58] Some big freaking bruiser walking around breacher. So let me throw this out. You often see that
[00:41:05] bachelor's degree is a requirement and a lot of companies can articulate that. Yeah why?
[00:41:12] Why is that even a requirement? In a not saying it you know it does show somebody took the
[00:41:18] the initiative to go complete their bachelor's degree or a master's and I understand that but
[00:41:23] he's got a great story about when C++ programming came along and I'll let him tell it
[00:41:29] but yeah just embarrassing for the people that were requesting a coder. Yeah I had it. It was
[00:41:36] actually Python was the language that they were coding in and I had a senior engineer come to
[00:41:41] me and say hey George you gotta go find me somebody with five years of Python experience.
[00:41:47] I'm like whoa we can't do that. He's like well why not?
[00:41:51] He said it's only been around three years and you might have not knocked that requirement back
[00:41:56] down to three but it's scary that he was so wired to getting an objective level of experience that
[00:42:04] he didn't relate to the job and was completely arbitrary and wasn't timed any measure of success.
[00:42:11] So I mean we calibrated him really quickly we got somebody that had spent most of their you know
[00:42:16] the last few years doing Python you know coding but you know working with that language but it
[00:42:23] was shocking that it came from an engineer. Yeah you gotta watch out for that one.
[00:42:31] Going back to the book the importance of a talent mindset and this is this is sort of a thread
[00:42:36] that goes throughout the book. A talent mindset is the deep belief that human capital is the single
[00:42:41] most important competitive advantage your company can have. When a company has talent mindset
[00:42:46] assessing, selecting and developing the best talent is a top priority. A talent mindset not only
[00:42:54] accounts for hiring talented people but also includes the continual development and investment
[00:43:00] in that talent through their tenure in the organization. So beyond just bringing people on board it's
[00:43:09] continuing to grow them and make them better. So we call the high potential. When you're going through
[00:43:15] the interview process to select new seals in when they graduate buds are they had performers?
[00:43:21] They're not yet. They haven't been proven. They they passed the first gate. That gate is closed.
[00:43:26] They are high potentials. So even if you're looking for a frontline trooper frontline employee or a
[00:43:31] brand new CEO when you bring them into the organization. If you made that decision that they're going
[00:43:35] to be part of the team even if that he's been a prior CEO in another company he's a high potential
[00:43:40] within that new organization. He's not proven yet. So in order to turn that person from a high
[00:43:44] potential I mean this this is what we do for a living in national unfrient. Now you have to
[00:43:47] develop them and that takes a lot of time and effort and it never stops. And if you want to turn
[00:43:52] that high potential into a high performer it's again it's you have to pour in and invest in those
[00:43:57] people and that's why special operations was sort of the the foundational organization we focused
[00:44:03] on in this book because they do it so well. At the core of what you know makes special operations
[00:44:08] so special it's their fundamental belief that people are everything and of course when we say
[00:44:13] people you're also talking about leadership. And then you know you look it's one of the things we
[00:44:17] drive through in the book that Talon mindset is that everything changes so rapidly today. Technology
[00:44:23] the economy markets companies you're only true competitive advantage is talent and that's what we're
[00:44:30] trying to convey is that it isn't the hardware in special operations it's the people and and that's
[00:44:37] how it's got to be in corporate America and it's got to be where you treat your human capital with
[00:44:43] the same rigor and the same focus that you treat your financial capital. And time and again Mike
[00:44:49] and I see that you know of course revenue, here's all people are focused on revenue they're not
[00:44:54] focused on the human capital which is driving everything. You get into this section chapter two what's
[00:45:03] so wrong with traditional hiring practices. George Feld has if you'd want a lottery for a career
[00:45:10] through a highly selective veteran hiring group you just been offered a position at one of the
[00:45:14] world's largest big box retailers according to the company representative they were looking for
[00:45:20] driven leaders who know new how to mentor lead and provide vision for people. Sounded like the
[00:45:25] perfect fit for George plus the job included good salary stock options and growth opportunity.
[00:45:30] It was George's first civilian job after nearly a decade of active duty service and we'd
[00:45:35] set him up to be able to go anywhere and do anything. George accepted the job his very first day of
[00:45:40] orientation training and onboarding was like a punch in the gut. Nothing was about talent or
[00:45:46] leadership. The position was none of the things they'd advertised or told him they didn't want
[00:45:50] a leader they wanted someone who'd fill vacant positions as quickly as possible with people who
[00:45:54] did hear strictly to the rules they were looking for cogs and a machine not talent. Accordingly
[00:45:59] their recruiting teams were evaluated based on efficiency their speed of filling vacant roles and
[00:46:03] cost per hire. To say it was a bad fit was a gross understatement nevertheless George soon proved
[00:46:08] himself to be a high performer and was promoted. His new role still wasn't a good fit fit so we applied
[00:46:14] for another position within the company he felt he would be more suitable. Despite exceeding all
[00:46:19] this key performance indicators and being ranked in the top 5% of his divisional employees the company
[00:46:24] refused to move him. He was succeeding in a leadership role that others struggled with so the
[00:46:29] company wanted to keep him there. George made it 20 months before he quit. He wasn't the only one who
[00:46:35] had to leave quickly. Several peers who shared his talent mindset let also left within two years.
[00:46:40] George and his peers had been able to transform and improve their small assigned corners of the
[00:46:45] company but as soon as they left everything reverted back to the status quo. A tradition went up
[00:46:50] and all the KPIs went unmet. George learned a lot of valuable lessons from that big box retailer
[00:46:55] primarily in what not to do which can be as important to knowing what to do. There was a first hand
[00:46:59] look at how broken traditional talent acquisition is. The mistakes this organization made are the
[00:47:05] same ones we see companies make again and again. And here they are lacking a talent mindset not
[00:47:10] understanding how HR should be structured to drive impact, having a butts and seats mentality,
[00:47:15] participating in fear-based hiring and settling for mediocrity. Anyone of these mistakes
[00:47:21] and spelled disaster foreign organization but the most destructive mistake is missing the talent mindset.
[00:47:28] Rough first tour out of the military huh? It was. It was and you know I've got a four-year
[00:47:33] old my wife's pregnant when I'm thinking okay I've had a great career. The things that made me
[00:47:38] successful in the military they're going to make me successful in the corporate world and I'm just
[00:47:42] fired up. You know young don't know what I don't know and use one of those veteran firms and
[00:47:48] oh I landed job. You know what I think is interesting about that is I bet that many people here
[00:47:58] oh you've got a guy that's been in the military for 10 years. What he wants and what he expects
[00:48:05] this is someone that doesn't it hasn't been in the military what he wants and what he expects is
[00:48:10] to be told what to do and then follow the protocol as has been as you're told and staying your box
[00:48:16] and anyone that's in the bend in the military knows that that's not how the military operates
[00:48:21] at least that's not how it should operate. So you go into that position they think oh cool we've got a
[00:48:25] cog here that we can just count on to you know run the numbers whatever follow the daily program
[00:48:33] when in reality what does a military individual want to do wants to improve things wants to make
[00:48:38] things better wants to grow wants to get more efficient wants to want to push and improve that's what we
[00:48:42] want to do and all of a sudden you're trapped in a situation where no don't do that. Oh yeah I was
[00:48:48] sitting there and you walk in the first day and I'm like what happened what did I miss how did I
[00:48:56] miss this you the other thing they wanted rule followers you know this is a big box retail or
[00:49:01] we won't we go to great likes we do not name any of these companies but I walk in the door
[00:49:05] everybody would know this one and they're expecting me to execute very specific rules I mean
[00:49:10] it they had a more manuals for the same task than the United States Army does it was it was
[00:49:16] phenomenal and that's impressive that's very impressive how you pull that off you want to know how to
[00:49:21] do something there's a there's a binder up there and you know this is this is before everything
[00:49:26] you know on on your iPads and on your computer and they wanted rule followers and immediately
[00:49:32] I knew that was wrong because to your point the one thing that I would add is you know military
[00:49:36] people come out want to win they want to make a difference they want to make an impact and so when
[00:49:43] you're looking at a company and you know you see this this big name and I got to be honest another
[00:49:49] way I got humbled was those stock options looked really really good when I came out I'm like
[00:49:54] who I've got equity I got something I would never get otherwise but they want to rule followers and
[00:50:00] and so there was no there were no latitude you know when I work my commanders you know everybody
[00:50:05] I work with they give me my left and right limits but they also entrust me to make good solid
[00:50:11] decisions that take care by people if I need to exceed that left and right limit and I communicate
[00:50:16] those things but I got here and it's literally you're in a really really small box and you you go
[00:50:22] from thinking that you're going to be wildly successful and to be honest with you I was because I don't
[00:50:28] care what you're going to throw at me I'm going to figure it out and and and I did but it was just
[00:50:33] missing so many things and veterans crave being able to make you were just making a difference
[00:50:37] of the service now you want to make a difference in the corporate world and you know I was kind
[00:50:42] of almost ashamed to come back tell my wife honey I think I made a mistake you know when she's
[00:50:47] even it's pregnant that was not coming out of my mouth you know I was just like okay I got to
[00:50:52] figure this stuff out but yeah bad fit yeah and just to make sure I clarify this point
[00:50:56] to say that military people we're not saying that military people are not rule followers
[00:51:04] correct and look in the military you follow all kinds of rules from the way you cut your hair
[00:51:09] to the way you've freaking wear your clothing like you follow rules but there's there's another
[00:51:15] level of this and as a leader the last thing I look I as a leader I wanted people that followed
[00:51:20] rules and here's the key point as long as the rules made sense and the rules didn't make sense
[00:51:26] I wanted my guys to come to me and say hey you know what jockel this thing that we're supposed to be
[00:51:30] doing it doesn't make any sense and here's why I don't want people that blindly follow rules that
[00:51:34] don't make sense if there's rules in place there's a good reason for them absolutely military guys are
[00:51:38] great military guys and men and women are great at taking a protocol and exercising that
[00:51:45] protocol and we have the discipline to and the mindset to get that done but what's even more important
[00:51:51] than that is having the mind to look at a problem look at a situation look at a protocol and say
[00:51:57] wait a second we can make this better we can do this more efficiently that's what that's not only
[00:52:03] what we do but it's what we want to do do what drives us because like you said we want to win
[00:52:09] yeah and you want to and you know and and and Mike and I try to do this with each other and you
[00:52:15] want to empower the people that work for you that you're leading to do the very same thing
[00:52:20] to say hey you've got a good idea and I brought a phrase from the two of you the best idea
[00:52:24] wins you come up with an idea it makes sense you know it's not illegal it's not a moral it's not
[00:52:29] an ethical and it's going to drive revenue or improve something hey let's get after let's go do it
[00:52:34] I came up with an idea that I figured out in one year would do two million dollars in operating
[00:52:40] cost reduction and the answer was is it in the book like well no and neither is the two million
[00:52:49] dollars by the way and it was still no and and you know that's kind of the environment where
[00:52:55] military leader goes okay I'm not going to reach my potential here I'm not going to be able to do
[00:52:59] all the things that I want to do and and you know it was challenged because you know I don't want to
[00:53:04] quit anything but you sometimes have to make those hard decisions in your career to say yeah
[00:53:09] I could impact better somewhere else and I did this supports something that I tell people all the time
[00:53:16] that the most important compensation you can give a human being is freedom and autonomy and
[00:53:24] and what that means is ownership ownership over your own destiny and if people like that's a
[00:53:28] classic example here you were you're getting good money you had good stock options you're crushing
[00:53:33] the job which means it's not like it's a tax on your mental power but none of that was compare another
[00:53:42] that none of that was had enough value to make you stay there exactly whereas if you were to had
[00:53:46] autonomy and freedom and the ability to control your own fate and destiny you'd still be there
[00:53:52] right now we wouldn't be having this conversation you'd be running the company yeah exactly
[00:53:56] and you know it's spot on and I came into a company two years ago and then I concertally
[00:54:03] named the company force point which is a room by Raytheon but a cybersecurity company and
[00:54:10] that's what the CEO and the CHRO gave me at that company and what's interesting is we put an
[00:54:17] ethos a marker in the ground for the entire team it was teamwork ownership humility
[00:54:23] turned around the entire I mean we walked into a dumpster fire frankly so when we walked into
[00:54:27] and we were able to do great things but that that value in that ownership that they gave me
[00:54:32] that I was able to give everybody on my team it's everything and so when you come into this
[00:54:37] moment's reconciliation becomes an issue that value that empowerment that ownership you give
[00:54:43] people they stick and in two years we had zero percent attrition wow is that you know what's
[00:54:51] amazing though is that that's a surprise to people and you know I'm kind of sitting back going how can
[00:54:57] that be so so much of a surprise that giving somebody ownership and trust and value is everything
[00:55:06] the most important thing the best form of compensation and the reason I've been able to tell
[00:55:11] that to clients at Ashland front is I say look I had people that you knew in the Sealteams
[00:55:16] in the military in the Navy if you're doing the best job you know three times better than anyone
[00:55:22] else in your opportunity I can't give you a raise okay like I can give you a good evaluation and then
[00:55:29] in two years you'll be eligible for promotion and then you'll get an extra $270 a month no one's
[00:55:37] doing three acts to work because of that but what can you give someone freedom and if you worked
[00:55:43] for me and you were square away you pretty much did whatever you wanted to do and then and I would just
[00:55:48] do nothing but provide cover fire for you if you weren't square away is a totally different
[00:55:52] ballgame you're going to put in a box and you weren't going to be able to maneuver at all because
[00:55:55] you're doing things wrong so the best way to retain your talent is great leadership and it goes
[00:56:03] back to bufre we just did he have battlefield the guysburg you know he operated within the spirit
[00:56:08] of the commanders intent and actually deviated from what was the plan because he saw an opportunity
[00:56:13] I think what the Marine Corps calls it took authority on demand and made calls that ultimately made the
[00:56:18] union army you know victorious over the the Confederates you know you did say something about
[00:56:25] and we deal with this with you have a watch is for some companies it's a mental leap
[00:56:32] to hire a military leader into a senior management role when they're coming fresh out of the military
[00:56:38] and it's usually because of those perceptions are shaped by what the movies
[00:56:44] 100% the water you guys I mean you follow orders that it's 100% the cogs in the wheel
[00:56:50] is shaped by movies and we literally have that conversation you know especially during COVID
[00:56:58] we've seen that a lot of organizations did not select the right leaders coming in the
[00:57:03] organization that were not able to innovate in the depth that were not able to handle the chaos
[00:57:08] could not remain calm and we're unable or ill-equipped for crisis and what we have to educate
[00:57:15] them about these men and women coming out is you know one they are generalists but generalists are
[00:57:23] much more powerful than specialists in fact one of the quotes from Brian Decker in this is that
[00:57:31] we've over specialized some of the roles in the private sector it's no longer good enough that
[00:57:36] you're an ear doctor you now have to be a left ear doctor and you know while I understand that
[00:57:43] that is requirement for certain roles if it's a very technical position yes technical skills are
[00:57:47] required but in general management roles which are usually your top leadership roles in a company
[00:57:53] generalists are more equipped to lead and this is why because they they draw from a broader base
[00:58:01] of experiences I mean you've been all run around the world in the military you've dealt with
[00:58:05] different cultures you've dealt with different problems such you have this vast array of experiences
[00:58:10] where a lot of the the business leaders that have never left the United States do not
[00:58:15] and we're finding that that that that experience has not only prepared them but it's the
[00:58:22] fact that there are a lot of these military that are stepping into the roles the ones we place
[00:58:26] are being highly successful they're performing when they step in of course there's a learning curve
[00:58:30] but the learning agility for the the men and women that we place is extremely high that's one of the
[00:58:36] things we're screening for Eddie if I've watched is that yeah into intellectual horsepower matters
[00:58:42] it does but once that gates closed these people are placed and it's it's been phenomenal I mean
[00:58:49] you met something the the clients at the eF battlefield they're like the best higher ever
[00:58:53] yeah the the train ability you know if you've been in the military you know how to learn
[00:58:58] you start learning stuff out of the gate and you learn how to learn very well and so that's why
[00:59:03] when someone comes without the skill set in the civilian sector they can learn that skill set very
[00:59:07] quickly because they've been learning all these different skill sets for eight years 12 years 20
[00:59:13] years 25 years that's what we do in the military it's a new stuff all the time going here section
[00:59:19] called the cost of talent when companies lack a talent mindset it's a common refrain cost creating
[00:59:25] a robust talent acquisition and management process is simply too costly they say what most
[00:59:30] companies don't understand is the major cost is not money but time and devotion to creating a
[00:59:36] world class talent acquisition pipeline in the process you will actually save money in the long run
[00:59:42] as your tuition lowers and you consistently make better hires the special operations community
[00:59:47] has long understood that people are everything special operations soldiers go through three main stages
[00:59:53] assessment and selection training and combat and war and then you guys break this out so in special
[00:59:59] operations it's called assessment and selection in business it's called talent acquisition
[01:00:04] or the hiring process and special operations it's called training in business it's called talent
[01:00:09] management and leadership development and then in special operations called combat and war
[01:00:14] and in business it's called business sales marketing production whatever is that you're doing it's a
[01:00:19] pretty good little break out there of how similar these things really are going in another section
[01:00:27] here may companies have a fundamental misalignment between upper leadership and HR where leadership says
[01:00:33] they want talent but HR is not set up to actually hire for talent in fact HR often doesn't even
[01:00:40] know what talent looks like in the company there's no gold standard of talent instead hiring
[01:00:45] is mechanical order taking process based on objective requirements leadership gives HR a laundry list of
[01:00:50] what they want years of experience required skill set compensation range and HR goes out and fills the
[01:00:56] order to have effective talent acquisition your business leaders and HR department must be strategic
[01:01:03] partners the talent acquisition team must be students of the business understanding the organizations
[01:01:09] underlying goals and talent needed to achieve them since day one in my career Joe DePento told us
[01:01:16] and that's the CEO of 711 I've always had my CHRO linked at the hip and will continue to
[01:01:24] as Joe is discovered to function strategically your HR department must be a part of the planning
[01:01:30] process for both talent acquisition and management HR should be involved in succession planning
[01:01:36] and gap analysis to assess select and develop talent in a strategic way you know we
[01:01:44] we found this you know I kind of knew it intuitively and I suspected it but when we did the research
[01:01:53] chief human resource officers are often paid one third of their C-suite counterparts that's where it
[01:02:02] starts could you imagine for a second that your your mechanics and your medics were paid a third
[01:02:10] of what you make because they're not frontline could you imagine what that would look like in
[01:02:14] special operations in any military unit and that's where it starts and and HR is not a strategic
[01:02:23] function and you know I had the benefit of coming up with this mentor and somebody who really
[01:02:28] empowered me in her name is Tracy Kio and she is the CHRO of Heal of Packard and she's just absolutely
[01:02:36] amazing you know we put this quote in the book because to this day it's still it's one of the reasons
[01:02:40] that I've stated my function for so long and she went to an executive meeting one day and they're like
[01:02:47] hey you know Tracy it's good to have HR at the table she kind of sneaker'd look back to them and
[01:02:52] she's she is a very strong leader and she says we are the table and I was like you know what that's
[01:02:59] that's right and that's the theme throughout this book is the people or everything so when you
[01:03:03] start out deprioratizing your chief human resources officer and you make this an administrative
[01:03:09] function or an operational function you know how do you ever expect to get the best talent and talents
[01:03:16] which are having your product talents what's driving your service talents in front of your
[01:03:19] customers talent is driving your revenue that's everything and then you sit there and you look at
[01:03:24] your revenue and your revenues declining your traditions high your products not on time and you're
[01:03:29] going to go on gee I wonder what's going on and it it it it takes Mike and I about all of two seconds
[01:03:35] to to see that and it's unfortunate and one of the things that we really wanted to get across is
[01:03:42] you can really leverage HR in a strategic function and it makes all the difference to every single
[01:03:47] part of your business and the more of a talent mindset you have and the more that you empower
[01:03:52] human resources to be your strategic talent partner that revenue will come that product will be
[01:03:58] on time that service will be good it's it's not rocket science but in some places it's a brand
[01:04:05] in concept let's go back to that cost so there's there's an old attitude you can't outspend
[01:04:11] a good hiring process yeah because the consequences of having a poor hiring process can sink
[01:04:19] a company one of the statistics we found is that for senior level executive positions
[01:04:24] the cost of a bad senior leader can be 213% of that individual's annual salary so giving
[01:04:33] example if there you have a 300 thousand dollar salary CEO or executive that could cost the company is
[01:04:40] highest 639 thousand that's let's say that's a direct cost so what a lot of companies can't
[01:04:47] track from a tuition is really the the indirect cost and that's about two thirds of the cost of
[01:04:54] a tuition you can't put a number on the damage to a culture that a senior leader can cost
[01:05:01] maybe for two years that impacts sales and that's what's very hard for a lot of companies because
[01:05:06] they can't see it on their bottom line directly good CEOs can come hang out to national
[01:05:11] on front and go work with some clients and you you'll get to see that all the time
[01:05:16] toxic leader a bad leader a leader with a negative attitude everyone below them either doesn't
[01:05:22] perform well or leaves if they're good and you know it is the good people as we said earlier the
[01:05:27] good people leave the bad people stay there and don't perform well that's what happens
[01:05:31] on their bad leader it's total nightmare what would see a little I think Henry Ford is
[01:05:36] credited with this quote they're at a board meeting and they were talking about leadership
[01:05:40] development and somebody said hey well what if we develop our people in they leave and Henry
[01:05:45] Ford looked at all them said what if we don't and they stay this is why leadership development
[01:05:50] matters so as you're reading that that section right there you saw George and I getting like
[01:05:56] agitated we get we I mean this is how passionate we are this subject so through echelon front
[01:06:02] I spoke with a HR group there was like 500 HR leaders from an area we did it it was supposed to
[01:06:09] be in person conference code and so it was on mine but I had like 100 HR leaders reach out they
[01:06:16] were just fired up because I talked about the book like you guys are the key to the success
[01:06:21] of every organization don't let your leaders tell you otherwise so you know Tracey Kio and
[01:06:28] Paddy McCor you know Paddy McCor was the CHRO for Netflix built a strong organization both
[01:06:36] these wait what's Netflix yeah both these ladies should be CEOs of any Fortune 500 company
[01:06:46] they just have a passion for talent acquisition in talent management or leadership development and
[01:06:52] I mean you look at Tracey Kio Harvard educated cutter teeth and sales and marketing and was
[01:06:58] asked at one point during the career hey we've got a problem with you know HR can you go fix it
[01:07:04] of course answer was no they said good you got it and she developed a passion your HR leader
[01:07:10] has to be a business leader they have to and HR even though I love HR sometimes has become a
[01:07:18] dumping ground for average or mediocre performers and most often those HR leaders are just
[01:07:26] compliance leaders they're not a strategic function so if your HR reports into legal it's a compliance
[01:07:36] function if they report into finance it's an overhead function but as Tracey Kio will tell you
[01:07:44] if they report into the CEO and have a direct line and they're involved in the talent strategy
[01:07:50] then there's a chance in hell there's strategic function that is going to help build the organization
[01:07:54] into a world class organization and so that's where that misalignment between senior leaders in HR
[01:08:01] is killing a lot of organizations because back to the talent mindset yeah that's a big that's a big
[01:08:07] change actually it's not even that big of a change it's a little change that will have a huge impact
[01:08:11] you start getting people to really start to grow the or grow an organization properly with the
[01:08:17] right people that's exactly what you're talking about you go into this section here I'm skipping
[01:08:23] ahead this section here that I liked it's it's entitled fear based hiring special operations
[01:08:29] community has become world class model for potential based hiring which is their foundation of
[01:08:34] their assessment and selection process in contrast many companies instead of hiring the candidates
[01:08:39] with the most potential higher those candidates that inspire the least amount of fear
[01:08:46] this kind of fear based hiring usually comes down to one of three fallacies number one red flags
[01:08:53] are more important than green flags number two leaders shouldn't be outshined by their followers
[01:09:00] and number three somebody's better than nobody you go on in traditional corporate hiring practices
[01:09:08] the objective has seemingly shift from higher the best to higher the familiar and safe people are
[01:09:16] more afraid of a bad higher than they are excited by a good higher you go on here fear based hiring
[01:09:25] is dogmatic about objective requirements you guys already talked about this black and white
[01:09:29] criteria make it easy to say yes or no does this person have ex years of industry experience does
[01:09:34] this person have wide degree these criteria don't matter nearly as much as you might think
[01:09:40] the ten-conylbrient decor former commander of army special forces assessment selection told us
[01:09:46] when I arrived in my command anything easily measured was heavily weighted in the selection process
[01:09:52] the problem was it didn't have a lot of predictive value the same is true in business
[01:09:57] just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's important and just because you can't
[01:10:01] measure something doesn't mean it's not important the only question that truly matters is does
[01:10:07] this person have the potential to be a top performer don't disregard red flags entirely but don't
[01:10:13] obsess over them either in combat you don't want to get shot but at the same time if you're
[01:10:18] primary concern is not getting shot then you don't go into battle if you make your hiring
[01:10:24] decision based on avoiding your worst case scenario you'll never achieve your best case scenario
[01:10:29] it's far more effective to look for green flags than for red flags oh people are scared
[01:10:35] you know and and and and and I don't want to get too far down into the minutia but if you're
[01:10:41] a manager and you've got an empty seat so many people that I've seen over 20 years are like
[01:10:46] I'm going to lose that seat if I don't get it filled with somebody I'm going to get somebody in there
[01:10:50] so anybody is better than somebody then they go down the objective requirements like well they
[01:10:56] don't have this they don't have this and so they're checking off red flags of objective requirements
[01:11:00] to put somebody roll and never asking the question is this the person with the character
[01:11:04] attributes that can do the job they're not looking they're they're literally scared well
[01:11:09] if I hire this person and oh they don't have five years how am I going to be looked at what
[01:11:16] if they don't do as well as I think and they don't they don't think that their leadership can
[01:11:22] take somebody with the right characteristics two or three years less experience than they
[01:11:27] mark and put them in the role and and and coach him to succeed they're they're scared to death
[01:11:32] they want it it just turns into this machine how fast how fast can you hire how fast can you get
[01:11:38] that butt in the seat I'll take that step further at the risk of being a little bit of a
[01:11:44] stereo typing people but who's hungrier the person that you know has two years experience going
[01:11:52] into a role that needs five years experience or wait will you know or the person that has seven
[01:11:57] years experience going into a role with five years experience required who's who's hungrier
[01:12:01] who's trying to prove themselves a little bit more I don't know man I'm going to be in
[01:12:05] Georgia to hear hungry individual that wants to prove themselves and and and I've seen this time
[01:12:11] and again is you know the recruiters that I've brought up to town acquisition specialist I call
[01:12:16] them talent consultants because they're really embedded in the business they'll go
[01:12:19] have talked with this guy yeah they're two or three years lied on the experience you were asking
[01:12:23] for I promise you this hungry they're hungry they want it they want to get after it
[01:12:28] and the manager says well they don't have the seven years of experience and it goes back to
[01:12:32] what Brian Decker said you know they picked seven years almost out of the year that seven years
[01:12:38] is not predictive of success working for a competitor is not predictive of success
[01:12:45] character attributes are predictive and you need to be watching for those check
[01:12:52] another fear but fear-based hiring problem leaders shouldn't be outshined by the followers
[01:12:59] average or underperforming managers often fear hiring someone who outshined them because they
[01:13:04] don't want to hire themselves out of a job there should never be a maximum standard for talent
[01:13:09] only a minimum if you're not hiring people better than your current employees you'll never
[01:13:13] raise the bar for talent within your organization that's just the classic surround yourself with
[01:13:19] people better better than you I want to work myself out of a job I want to have and we go in
[01:13:24] a little bit later about succession planning I need to have as many people who can take my
[01:13:28] place and corporate mercados and do that you know the succession planning we do in the military
[01:13:33] to muscle memory but I always want people who are going to push me to be a better leader they're
[01:13:38] going to push me to get better at my game to up the game I mean when you roll with people do you
[01:13:42] roll with people that are easy to beat sometimes
[01:13:46] something I can't I might want this this toxic environment right now it's here for an hour
[01:13:53] it's waiting for a moment that's the first moment for echo Charles to shine yeah sometimes I do
[01:13:59] roll with people that are easier a lot easier you do somebody's better than nobody and you you
[01:14:08] know you talked about that just feeling like we better get someone in the platoon and you know
[01:14:12] this happened in in Charlie Ptun life had a guy a good guy but he just wasn't really didn't
[01:14:19] really have the just couldn't get the job done and you know coach and we wrote about it in
[01:14:25] dichotomy and leadership but one of the things that I told Laef I said hey Laef if you get rid
[01:14:30] of this guy you're not getting another one I mean there's there's you know you're going to go
[01:14:34] on deployment you're just with missing a guy and because we're going to we're going to get rid of
[01:14:39] and you know Laef was like well and he thought about it he said you know what I think we're
[01:14:46] better off without him and you know that to me that was a little litness test for me because you know
[01:14:50] Laef might be thinking hey I'll just replace him with some other guy and we'll you know we'll
[01:14:53] step it up it was a litness test for me to see what Laef really was thinking and if you really
[01:14:58] would rather not take someone that means you don't feel comfortable with him at all so there's a quote
[01:15:06] from Charlie Beckwith for the listeners Charlie Beckwith is the founder of Delta Force you know
[01:15:12] surf time with the SAS which generated the idea for for a specialized force yet a quote that was
[01:15:18] I'd rather go down the river with seven studs than 100 shitheads and it goes to point that
[01:15:29] yeah I'd rather select highly talented people into the organization and have less people
[01:15:33] than you know falling quantity is not better than quality never has been and you know the the quote
[01:15:41] from her kill her your clippers the Greek philosopher 500 BC about the 100 soldiers on the
[01:15:50] on the battlefield 80 or sorry 80 or just targets tend to even deserve to be there and then there's
[01:15:59] 10 that are warriors but that one that one will always bring us home I mean these guys all talked about
[01:16:04] the the importance of talent and you'd rather bring talent people in individually
[01:16:10] then build a massive quick army that's when you deviate from the process it works out poorly for you
[01:16:15] yeah when you bring the wrong person in you're actually just creating more drain on your time
[01:16:20] just mayhem yeah mayhem and then it's a cancer and then your A players are looking at you going
[01:16:25] why do you bring a sea player in and now it reflects on you as the leader that your bar
[01:16:32] wasn't high enough the your standards weren't high enough that you were tolerating this sea player
[01:16:36] this be player and we all don't have that works out and never ever well
[01:16:46] next section what makes special operations so special and in here you you kind of profile
[01:16:54] one individual an individual by the name of Johnny Kim which podcast 2021 you can listen
[01:17:04] Johnny Kim's story it's it's just unbelievable what what made you want to profile Johnny in here
[01:17:12] so Johnny and I and Ryan were all in the same but class and what stuck out about Johnny now
[01:17:20] it goes back to why I was judging Ryan you got to understand my career prior to that I'd finished
[01:17:25] number one in pretty much every military school from boot camp in school of infantry
[01:17:29] finished third and recon school out of thirty behind two guys that went on to be Marzokde at one
[01:17:34] even you know graduate number one from Reno CS so when you're on a successful track what
[01:17:40] what happens you become a little bit arrogant you think you have things figured out and I thought
[01:17:43] I had things figured out naturally because I was still a sergeant in the Marine Corps the class
[01:17:49] sort of gravitated towards me because I had a rough neck style of leadership and they loved it and
[01:17:53] the instructors loved it as well but Johnny I just sort of always dismissed Johnny because small
[01:18:00] Asian kid Korean from LA just you know he's sort of I don't want to say devoid of emotion
[01:18:07] he's not he's not a showy guy and naturally because he didn't have a flame buoyant personality
[01:18:12] I figured out the sketches not performed it he's just another one of the the students that
[01:18:16] he was going to drop or go make it through and be a non-factor in the sealed teams
[01:18:21] in this book I think you're seeing that I show my ass a lot in these assumptions that I made about
[01:18:26] you know who's going to be a good seal and who wasn't and you know usually that was wrong
[01:18:31] but those are the scars as you get involved in town acquisition it is like you don't
[01:18:36] become better at this process of assessing and selecting the right people in your organization
[01:18:41] unless you screw up yeah I'd say your assessment was wrong
[01:18:45] on multiple levels because not only is Johnny Kim an awesome seal and ranks you know above
[01:18:53] among the highest of you know respect in the seal teams but then just as a human I mean then
[01:19:00] as a Harvard doctor and then as an astronaut and then just basically as an overall human being
[01:19:06] he's right up there with very rare fire there so I talked to Johnny what I you know I wanted to
[01:19:14] get approved through NASA that he was good he read you know I think the instructors looked
[01:19:18] Johnny and they just sort of you made a snap of judge judgment you know he's just quite
[01:19:24] little guy and watching him because again we both reported in the sealed team three my job
[01:19:29] just continued to drop because he was better than I was was day one out of Buds I mean he was just
[01:19:34] that smart where he picked up everything quickly you know 18 delta now he's a high speed medic
[01:19:39] quickly rushed to sniper school becomes a sniper you know you either be treating
[01:19:46] casualties on the battlefield or he'd be pulling the trigger eliminating Islamic
[01:19:49] extremists and the guy was amazing and humbled to to to have served with him and
[01:19:58] based off his podcast we had a very close conversation about one night in the soccer city
[01:20:02] which you know was a bad night for everyone but ultimately that was on stone or an eye
[01:20:08] that we even let the guys go out when we knew we weren't ready but yeah it's the the point with
[01:20:13] Johnny's a lot of people just would have looked past him quickly because you know he didn't have
[01:20:17] college degree from LA nothing stood out on paper because you you want you know peel that on you back
[01:20:27] yeah I think I think a good word to describe Johnny that you would pick up is just unassuming right
[01:20:33] he's just I think he just she's just unassuming and he that's what he is I mean it's it's
[01:20:40] less now because you kind of people know his background now so I'm sure that just comes across
[01:20:46] but it's super just a super humble on the unassuming guy and yeah uh a beast now I tell people
[01:20:55] I worked with Johnny Kim you know I start with Johnny Kim that's awesome
[01:21:00] the origins of the soft talent minds at the very core of soft is a talent mindset the idea
[01:21:10] that small group of talented individuals can be effective fighting force capable of defeating
[01:21:14] larger enemy forces in delivering strict strategic impacts through skull small scale operations
[01:21:20] three innate traits of lead spot special operations talent mindset and subsequent success one
[01:21:27] no one has prior special operations experience so raw talent must be the selection criteria
[01:21:35] the most effective selection is based on mindset and character that's a crazy thing to think about
[01:21:41] that when you go into special operations they're most of the time there's zero experience
[01:21:46] in special operations you know that's just that's like a crazy thing to think about
[01:21:52] where does that seal come from he comes from a high school you know this is the story you know
[01:21:58] we're working with business leaders and they think they need to experience it so important I
[01:22:01] say hey I don't go to a high school and say hey we're recruiting for Navy SEALS raise a hand if you
[01:22:06] have special operations experience don't it guys you did you know it was your bowl hate French foreign
[01:22:11] Legion the UK special forces go get some experience come back and uh and then let us know
[01:22:17] uh next one special operations for since our teams teams win not individuals number three special
[01:22:24] operations teams work in high stakes environments when the stakes are high mediocrity is unacceptable
[01:22:29] let's look more closely at these traits raw talent this is this is no emphasis on experience
[01:22:35] raw talent is difficult to identify industry experience on the other hand is far easier to identify
[01:22:39] and measure this is why business world often falls in the bad habit of overaligning on industry
[01:22:44] experience and as a hiring criterion special operations does not have that luxury because nobody has
[01:22:50] prior special operations experience if the soft community began selecting for industry experience
[01:22:55] the US would not have a special operations community out of necessity special operations had
[01:22:59] to develop a core competency in potential based hiring where raw talent is the primary consideration
[01:23:07] that's self-explanatory next one team mentality special operations forces are structured as teams they
[01:23:12] are incentivized as teams and they win or lose as teams not as individuals in contrast in the
[01:23:17] biz world in the business world the egos can often rule and the team can be less and emphasized
[01:23:23] people are rewarded for individual achievements so individuals are often concerned only about
[01:23:28] their incentives versus the overall health of the organization bad leaders who hire and manage
[01:23:33] others often accept and often and even encourage mediocre employees because it raises their own value
[01:23:39] in comparison a team mentality greatly reduces the power of ego yeah there's nothing worse than
[01:23:49] encouraging mediocre people to be in your organization so that you can look good
[01:23:58] does you have something on that Mike?
[01:24:00] I do let me hit back on the lack of industry experience to real vignette so again we quoted
[01:24:07] Charlie Beckwith if you didn't know it because we also interviewed what we didn't interview
[01:24:12] Charlie Beckwith because he's passed but we did interview throughout this book a guy named
[01:24:17] General Jerry Boykin amazing individual was a long time dealt a forced memory even the commander
[01:24:25] was involved in desert one operation the equal claw so you know we went into the history
[01:24:30] Charlie Beckwith was a strong believer that before you could even get into special operations
[01:24:35] and this was the old sort of mentality that that that existed within the military that you have to
[01:24:40] serve as a conventional soldier either an officer and listed before you could try out for special
[01:24:45] operations and he was very dogmatic about that and General Boykin talked about when the
[01:24:52] Army Special Forces community created the 18 X-ray program because of the needs of the war where they
[01:24:57] took people directly off the street that had the right attributes past the initial tests intelligence
[01:25:04] physical standards mental standards that they actually made as good of special forces soldiers
[01:25:12] if not better because they didn't have bad habits from the conventional forces that was one of you
[01:25:17] so let's put that into a private sector you know context the other vignette google did a
[01:25:23] study on what made their most successful managers so successful they they they they came up with
[01:25:31] ten criterion that made them so highly successful industry experience came in a number number nine
[01:25:37] it was one of the the least important things now if you look at extreme ownership pretty much all
[01:25:42] these principles of how we lead were much farther ahead than the importance of extreme I'm sorry
[01:25:47] the industry experience so that's why this potential based hiring is so much more powerful than
[01:25:53] objective trivial requirements like industry experience when when they started the 18 X when did they do that
[01:26:03] I want to say that was roughly around 2003 2004 that that program came to revolution
[01:26:10] I'd have to go back and find the exact year yeah John strike reminder was talking about that
[01:26:16] and how there was like people in the special forces community that were saying all this is
[01:26:21] garbage you're gonna get these guys that don't know what they're doing but like so many of those
[01:26:26] sag operators went right from boot camp to you know to a it and then on the special force
[01:26:33] and then they went right over to Vietnam and freaking just got after he he like was laughing about it
[01:26:38] because those guys were just freaking legit what with general boikom was telling the story you know
[01:26:44] you had senior leaders when he was the commander of use to sock which is he's the commander of
[01:26:49] all army special operations and they were arguing there's two camps of no we can't accept people
[01:26:54] without conventional infantry experience and the other camp was hey know we can take people off
[01:26:59] the street and turn them into great special forces soldiers and of course what there is a command
[01:27:04] soldier major use to sock sitting back the senior and listed visor wall both camps fought
[01:27:09] and finally he said when he piped in he said hey I was an OJT soldier in Vietnam I didn't go to
[01:27:16] the special forces qualification course they sent me right over to uh to to Vietnam and I learned
[01:27:21] the job well outside in the wire and they all shut up and you said okay there you go
[01:27:26] right uh last thing high stakes perhaps more than any other factor the high stakes under which
[01:27:33] the soft operators under which soft operates necessitate a talent mindset war and combat are among
[01:27:40] the most unforgiving environments in the world on the stake on the battlefield can mean the
[01:27:44] difference between life and death not only for oneself but for ones fellow soldiers a failed
[01:27:49] mission can mean the destruction of cities and the loss of civilian life excellence and execution
[01:27:53] is the standard because it has to be the stakes are that high it should be no difference in bit
[01:27:58] different in business in business the risk may not be life or death but the stakes are incredibly
[01:28:03] high don't fool yourself businesses war war by nonviolent means the result of a bad hire or
[01:28:09] several bad hires is the underperformance of the business if not a nose dive to bankruptcy it is
[01:28:16] not literal death but it is death in the marketplace that death spells disaster for you and your
[01:28:21] employees whose well-being depends on the health of your organization look at today covid hit us
[01:28:31] for those people that have these attributes as leaders they'll factor there's like okay hey that's
[01:28:37] part of the environment we got to operate in let's go do it all right hey let's you know let's
[01:28:41] prioritize what we got to pay attention to how do we pay attention to our people how do we pay
[01:28:45] attention to our product how do we continue to drive the revenue and take care of our people
[01:28:49] and it and it was it just didn't phase those people and I've been around quite a few of them
[01:28:54] were it was like okay yeah we got covid okay and what's your point but you can start to see
[01:29:00] those companies where that talent wasn't there where that talent mindset where that leadership
[01:29:05] wasn't there covid hits they lose their minds what did they do let's start cutting people let's
[01:29:11] cut this let's cut this immediately we'll we're going through today speaks exactly to
[01:29:19] why it's so critical to have a talent mindset and get people with those character attributes
[01:29:24] in the roles that make a difference and and and I love but you guys have pointed out earlier
[01:29:28] the US military is in the most powerful force in the world it's the US economy and that was one of
[01:29:32] the things we wanted to do with this book was to we want to continue to contribute to strengthen that
[01:29:41] you go into a skip and ahead a little bit you go into a scenario and it just it just spells out
[01:29:48] exactly what you're talking about you got a guy Daniel you go into this Daniel's looking to
[01:29:52] hire candidates for sales leadership position and he used two search firms EF Overwatch which is
[01:29:58] what which is excellent front and a competitor and Jeremy so this is here's the two people
[01:30:05] that got presented Jeremy presented by a competitive search firm 3.9 GPA from a prestigious
[01:30:11] university high intelligence four years of industry experience with two different companies
[01:30:15] driven highly competent borderline arrogant Chris presented by EF Overwatch 3.2 GPA from a
[01:30:25] public university above average intelligence faced significant adversity in life came from a
[01:30:30] lower middle class family and held a full-time job on college recently separated army infantry
[01:30:35] officer who held several different functional billets in the army has all the attributes
[01:30:40] are required to be a highly successful sales leader but lacks industry experience which of these
[01:30:46] candidates would you choose since this chapter is about hiring for character in scale you might know
[01:30:51] the answer is most likely Chris not Jeremy but be honest at your company which one of these
[01:30:56] candidates would most likely be hired that's a good question when you put be honest in front of it
[01:31:02] because right because it's a fear-based hire is to go you know what we don't know about this
[01:31:05] Chris guy he seems like a good guy using the army but man Jeremy he's got four years of experience
[01:31:12] you go on most companies would choose Jeremy without hesitation Chris's GPA was average
[01:31:16] compares to Jeremy's but he didn't have the industry specific experience but he was one of those
[01:31:22] people who perform time and time again whatever you put in front of him you'd find a way through it
[01:31:26] over it or around it he was relentless and adaptable so you go on they they have eventually chose
[01:31:34] Jeremy over Chris and two weeks later the guy calls up and says we made a huge mistake
[01:31:40] that's how it turns out that click that click time and time again it and here's the funny thing is
[01:31:51] you remember tray holder who helped us out during the infancy of if ever watched we had this call
[01:31:58] and it was either we can have to two weeks after they made that selection and this leader within
[01:32:06] the company who we had a personal relationship said hey this guy is an arrogant you know what he's
[01:32:12] like we've got a problem and you know we're not going to say hey we told you so the guy he's trying
[01:32:17] to run a major distribution center he made a call we're there to support him and our basic
[01:32:23] question was well do you want to talk to our candidate he said no and said we asked what what are you
[01:32:28] going to do about it he said nothing and I just asked him was said if you have some of the
[01:32:34] that you feel is going to poison the culture why aren't you going to do anything and it was if I
[01:32:39] get let him go two weeks into the job my senior leaders are going to look at me like what are you
[01:32:46] doing down there and so that individual was going to let it ride I haven't talked to him I don't
[01:32:50] know if that individual stayed and sometimes things changed within four you know a few weeks maybe
[01:32:55] that that individual who was arrogant came around but uh well you think the chances of that are
[01:33:01] very well it's but how often it and let's you know we talked a lot about special operations
[01:33:07] and how great of an organization is how great they are selecting high potentials but how often
[01:33:12] if we're being honest with ourselves did we let mediocracy rain within the seal teams yeah I
[01:33:19] mean you need you need people and what what was horrible you know I didn't mind that look you
[01:33:26] you got to have people that are going to do some of the jobs that are a little bit easier in the
[01:33:29] teams I mean it's just the reality the situation and you know when I was going through officer candidate
[01:33:33] school I had whatever 80 people in my class in my officer candidate class I was the class president
[01:33:40] and you got to write like suggestions to the drill instructor and or whatever so I guess a group of
[01:33:49] people like four or five people because I had a bunch of prior and listed guys in my class all great
[01:33:53] guys and and female as well there's guys and girls in there and somebody wrote to the the drill instructor
[01:34:00] and said we need to get rid of these four people they don't belong they don't belong as officers
[01:34:07] in the Navy and so my drill instructor whose name was gunnery sergeant seals oddly enough great guy
[01:34:15] you know as you know I mean any Marine Corps drill instructors just freaking out standing so he
[01:34:21] gets up and he says hey I'll tell you what let's say we get rid of the bottom 10% of this class
[01:34:30] and he says now what happens tomorrow we got a new bottom 10% what happens after that we got a new
[01:34:36] bottom 10% so eventually realize you can guess what there's going to be a bell curve in any
[01:34:41] organization where I have a problem with this so so that's my explanation like hey the seal teams
[01:34:46] look you're gonna have some guys that are not the not long ball hitters you know you're gonna have
[01:34:51] some guys that are not long ball hitters the problem I have and and had and still have
[01:34:57] is when you take those guys and you put them in the leadership positions that's where it's a problem
[01:35:02] that's where it's a real problem in my book and we still love that to happen yeah it happened we
[01:35:06] still love that to happen because hey they've put in their time they've earned that spot you that's
[01:35:09] not a good criteria first off I'm gonna say you guys have a suggestion box in Navy officer
[01:35:14] candid school yeah it wasn't really a suggestion box I don't I don't that's why I couldn't really
[01:35:19] name what it was but it was some way of communicating with the drone structure I don't I forget what
[01:35:25] it was because I didn't do it but because I'm just gonna say it Marine Corps officer candid school
[01:35:31] that was called the trash can and the drone structures did not care you was a suggestion to you
[01:35:36] I don't know I don't know where I don't know where this idea came from I'm thinking to must have
[01:35:40] been some kind of suggestion box or maybe they raised their hands and asked him I don't know
[01:35:44] but it was it was the reason I remember it it was somehow clandestine right they weren't they didn't
[01:35:50] say in the middle of a class like because we used to basically get briefed all the time saying
[01:35:54] in the hallways the barracks you know you'd all say it out front of your rooms you're all in big
[01:35:57] lines so no one had the courage to say hey officer candid Smith Jones and and brown need to be
[01:36:06] let go no one had the courage to that so they somehow through some mechanism and I get your humor
[01:36:11] through some mechanism they they got to the to the drone structure and yeah I don't know what
[01:36:18] that mechanism was but no the the navy officer candid school was pretty good to go I thought
[01:36:29] how did good time we we so we actually one of the candidates to came to you if ever watch
[01:36:32] fighter pilot actually was going through the training because we hold webinars every Friday
[01:36:36] both in leadership and then career search and struck a quarter of this guy he actually moved
[01:36:42] to Austin he's like hey just just so you know I went to officer candid school with with Chaka
[01:36:46] with willing yeah he's like that guy saw later so you bring up a point that again we nerd out on this
[01:36:54] yeah all talent follows a bell curve or normal distribution curve and you know that that is a
[01:37:01] fundamental truth however the performance within that talent distribution is more like a I'm sorry
[01:37:07] the the the performance is more along lines of a power distribution or some people call it the
[01:37:11] paradeo principle it's just 80% of the results driven within your organization come from 20% of the
[01:37:17] workforce that's that's it's just the realities as you say but ultimately what makes better
[01:37:23] organizations and as we did the research is that competing companies within the industry all have
[01:37:28] that bell curve it's you want the average performance of your entire workforce the statistical mean
[01:37:35] to be higher than your competitors yeah and that's what makes special operations
[01:37:41] so great is that not everyone's a a player they're not that's a small element the the long tail
[01:37:49] but the overall performance of the entire force is much higher yeah you know slide that
[01:37:54] thing to the right yeah that's the goal for sure so we're talking all about all this you know
[01:38:01] experience and and how that's not the most important thing but then you guys go on to say this
[01:38:06] which is also important we're not advocating that you disregard experience entirely you're not
[01:38:10] going to hire kids straight out of high school for a C-suite position experience and past performance
[01:38:14] matters for certain positions but you do need to be thoughtful about how you use experience
[01:38:19] in the selection process we see companies make three common mistakes when it comes to looking
[01:38:25] experience one they require experience that doesn't matter to job performance two they require
[01:38:31] very specific experience when general experience would be just as good and three they prioritize
[01:38:36] industry experience over character so you guys aren't saying to ignore experience you're saying
[01:38:42] hey pay attention to it exactly it's and ultimately it's not what counts and you know one of the other
[01:38:49] fallacies is you know if I have somebody with experience it was working at this competitor and I
[01:38:53] bring them in well they were successful there they'll be successful here that that's just I boggles my
[01:38:59] mind and I see it all the time but yeah these are the three the three mistakes and you know we talk
[01:39:04] about this in the book about gates once you set your requirements for this role and they meet those
[01:39:10] that gate then closes everything after that is this part of what determines success as far as the
[01:39:18] nine attributes and most people and you'll and on the ground level you'll watch a person come in you've
[01:39:23] got these objective requirements and you'll have five people in the hiring process all these five
[01:39:28] different members of the team and they will all ask different versions of the same questions about
[01:39:32] their experience nobody's digging in nobody's digging in it I you know it's patience is a
[01:39:41] virtue in my function I assure you and but they're listing out experience and hiring majors will
[01:39:47] dump all of this stuff in thinking if I get all of this this experience and one person my company will
[01:39:53] do better they're looking at the wrong things it's the character it's those attributes that make the
[01:39:58] difference when when a COVID comes up when when a when another company comes out with a product when
[01:40:04] you know we're behind or or we're short team members it's those character attributes that drive
[01:40:09] that team forward when things get tough when you're under stress that's when character reveals
[01:40:15] itself and in the business world that's when it counts the most so we over rotate on experience
[01:40:24] and you know you know Mike and I try to go to great lengths in this book look we understand
[01:40:29] your business leader you've got 50,000 things going on if you're a CEO you've got a million
[01:40:34] things going on in your head but this will help you be better this is the competitive advantage
[01:40:40] that you need and is prioritizing talent and these things that make the difference and yet these
[01:40:46] three common mistakes they happen time and time and time again they will happen 10 times a day in
[01:40:51] one company and that's a small company you get to a big company some of the fortune 50 that I've
[01:40:55] worked with you'll see this a thousand times in one day and it and it multiplies itself but you guys have
[01:41:02] both seen and I've seen it in my time you get a good leader you get talent on your team that's infectious
[01:41:08] the game comes up you get a good player you get a rock star you're all like okay I'm chasing that guy
[01:41:14] I'm coming up I gotta elevate my game because this is not looking good for me you know person
[01:41:19] I love person on my right they're out trying to me I gotta step it up so you know you've got to
[01:41:24] get the experience that's minimum for the job hey you gotta be able to do these things in the job
[01:41:29] it doesn't matter we're not saying disregard it don't make it so specific that is really now talent
[01:41:36] and that happens a lot and industry experience is not as important as you think and I mean google
[01:41:42] points it out I mean it you know statistically it's not important but it makes managers feel better
[01:41:47] oh I took somebody from my competitor they were doing really well they know our industry they're
[01:41:51] gonna do well here it's just a fallacy and and if we can get people focused on character if we get
[01:41:58] people focused on leadership that will power your company when the hard times come hey you're
[01:42:05] gonna rock it you're gonna survive you're gonna make the U.S. economy that much more powerful
[01:42:10] if you get the right mindset and you focus and you drive and get after it Brian Decker
[01:42:15] talked about this with special forces assessment selection so to get into any of these special
[01:42:20] operations community intellectual horsepowers requirement you have to have a minimum score we take
[01:42:25] as bad there's a score once person passes that intelligence requirement what George is talking
[01:42:31] about is that gate is closed it no longer comes back into the planning factor the hiring factor
[01:42:36] whatsoever and what they found is that level they put a lot of thought behind it and what they see
[01:42:42] is that if somebody hits what requirement dead on and somebody exceeds that requirement is that
[01:42:48] the person that exceeds that requirement it's not necessarily correlated to a higher level of
[01:42:52] performance so that's why you have to be very careful upfront about the gates you select
[01:42:58] you know Brian Decker also told a story about again you know industry experience versus none
[01:43:03] so when he was running SFAS you know sometimes we we bring civilians on and get in sort of the
[01:43:09] dog and pony they put two groups through some obstacles that special forces soldiers run through
[01:43:16] in groups and again these exercises are you know the cadre are watching to see what behaviors
[01:43:23] come out from that from the individuals so it's a group of MBAs who were off the charts intelligence
[01:43:29] had industry experience were were currently getting their MBAs and then a group of undergrads
[01:43:35] you're talking 18 19 20 year olds first group of 27 to 35 year olds and you know naturally Brian
[01:43:42] Decker and his cadre you know they were shown a good time but had an assumption that the
[01:43:47] MBAs were just going to outperform the undergrads like cans down how do you think that I know
[01:43:53] the undergrads absolutely decimated every obstacle much quicker than the MBA group
[01:44:00] and it goes to to show you that you know that even though they had prior experience more vast
[01:44:05] experience those undergrads actually because they lacked ego so it's yes they lacked the group
[01:44:11] dynamic it goes to so if you have a lot of talented individuals that are humble and
[01:44:15] lackey you go when they come together it's an exponential effect one plus one isn't too
[01:44:19] with a group that truly unifies behind a common good one plus one equals three that it's an
[01:44:26] exponential effect in task unit bruiser there was a point where we were I don't know how far
[01:44:33] we were from deploying but we knew we were deploying to Iraq and one of the senior officers at the
[01:44:39] command he came to me and said hey you know you're going to Iraq do you want to switch out
[01:44:48] one of your platoons with this other platoon commander with this with this other platoon
[01:44:53] who the platoon commander has a lot more experience than your two you know your two oh I see
[01:44:58] is which was Seth and Lave and it's kind of funny because remember how the ceilings were out
[01:45:05] because they were doing construction so Seth and Lave were in the task unit bruiser office and they
[01:45:09] here this individual basically asking me if I wanted to swap out either one of these two so
[01:45:18] Seth and Lave had very little experience they both on one deployment but they had just been
[01:45:20] in the teams for like two years and one of the platoon commanders in one of the other platoons
[01:45:25] had a lot more experience like he was a prior-in-listed guy and so the senior officer was saying hey
[01:45:31] you know you can take one you know you can take this guy and his platoon and he's got way more
[01:45:35] experience and might be a lot better for you and I was like I was like no and at this point I already knew
[01:45:41] Seth and Lave and I go um no I said these guys have exactly what I want them to have which is
[01:45:48] they're tough they're humble and they listen and that's all that's all I need that's like my
[01:45:52] most important characteristics and he was like are you sure and I was like 100% that was that.
[01:46:03] Next section the nine foundational character attributes of talent under pressure
[01:46:09] one's mental and physical limits hard skills rapidly degrade what remains is character
[01:46:15] skills are by design meant for unpredictable situations and environments says retired
[01:46:23] seal commander rich divinity if businesses are interested in forming organizations and teams that
[01:46:29] effectively deal with unpredictability and complexity they have to go deeper than the guy who has
[01:46:35] the best sales record or the Harvard grad who's at the top of the class they have to look at character
[01:46:41] characters key because it is an indicator of a person's capacity general William Boynkin points
[01:46:48] to capacity as more important than current ability quote what are you looking for hard skills
[01:46:56] or capacity ideally look for both but if you have to choose and you have a fair way of doing so
[01:47:03] assess their capacity what is their capacity to learn new skills what is their capacity to think
[01:47:07] for themselves what is their capacity to problem solve is it interesting you're here general Boynkin
[01:47:14] like one of the priorities that he puts in there is their capacity to think for themselves not to
[01:47:19] follow rules but to think for themselves back to the book according to general Boynkin it is the
[01:47:26] focus on capacity is made special operation so successful on the battlefield and beyond a person's
[01:47:31] character is the aggregate of their deeply ingrained attributes as we define it the nine foundational
[01:47:37] character attributes of high potential individuals are drive resiliency adaptability humility integrity
[01:47:44] effective intelligence team ability curiosity and emotional strength these traits are predictors
[01:47:50] of high performance these attributes cannot be taught so they should be the focus of your hiring
[01:47:58] check and then you're going to a little spot a little section about how
[01:48:03] different special operations group sort of way those things out a little bit differently but
[01:48:09] they all are looking for the same basic the same basic things kickcare doctor care all green
[01:48:17] air force kernel psychologist he was heavily involved in the Marsoch assessment selection
[01:48:24] he set a grid he's like they're all basically looking for ice cream just different like slightly
[01:48:29] different flavors but you know the special forces guys seals Marsoch you know the Afsoch
[01:48:36] guys of PJs and CCTs they're all interchangeable we have throw them in their group the attributes
[01:48:41] are are very close totally you go into resiliency here a little bit somebody with high resiliency
[01:48:47] bounces back from stress quickly is adaptable and is not easily discouraged and individual with
[01:48:52] high resiliency resist quitting and is focused on completing goals essentially resiliency is how
[01:48:58] people handle setbacks and persevere in the face of challenges they accept failures part of the process
[01:49:03] they don't accept it passively but utilize their lessons learned and mistakes as a basis to grow
[01:49:10] and then you go into a well it's a section about a person that could be considered possibly one of
[01:49:18] the most resilient human beings in the world which is Mike Day who is just on this podcast number
[01:49:23] 241 and you know shot 27 times and then killed the enemy that had shot him and just unbelievable
[01:49:33] story you put that in there you you've gone so yeah adaptability you talk about adaptability talk
[01:49:40] about humility and here we go people often asked us what is the most important trade of any leader
[01:49:45] without a doubt it's humility the US army a 244 year old institution credited with training
[01:49:53] some of our nation's most prominent leaders and practically writing the leadership manual for
[01:49:56] leaders in any field recently added humility as one of the key attributes of good leaders to the
[01:50:02] army doctrine publication six tack 22 saying a leader with the right level of humility is a
[01:50:08] willing learner maintains accurate self awareness and seeks out others input and feedback
[01:50:13] and this is something that one day on our echelon front ops call I said hey I've got something to
[01:50:22] tell everyone in this group we've been talking about humility as the most important characteristic
[01:50:26] for a leader for the past 13 years or whatever was 12 years at the time and the army just added
[01:50:32] this to their manual which is freaking awesome because those characters extend and changed for a
[01:50:36] long long time in the army but they realized if you're not humble you got problems I just want to say
[01:50:42] plagiarism is one of the high forms of flattery so if you bring your lawyers at me we will go
[01:50:47] to tell a lot of this is taken from my mentors I did not credit you in certain spots
[01:50:55] it goes back to Johnny and I think the military as a whole there was a point where we viewed
[01:51:01] humility as weakness and I think at a young age I miss took somebody like Johnny who's just one of
[01:51:09] the most humble dudes he still is as a slight form of weakness it's funny that the army I think
[01:51:18] sort of has morphed as well their their view on that the criticality of humility
[01:51:25] yeah no no doubt about it and you also realize after you know you've realized
[01:51:31] the thing that pointed this out to me strong did anything else was when we were fire a guy
[01:51:35] that was going through my training we would be firing that person if they want a leadership position
[01:51:40] if they want a leadership position they could get fired for safety or a number of anything
[01:51:44] any other things but if they were getting fired from a leadership position they were generally
[01:51:49] having safety problems they weren't having they knew how to shoot their gun they were in good
[01:51:53] physical condition they were getting fired because they lack humility which meant they weren't
[01:51:57] listening to anybody else they weren't listening to the critique from their own
[01:52:00] platoon they weren't listening to advice from their platoon chief or from their task in the
[01:52:03] corner anyone else I definitely not the freaking training contract so they're just a disaster
[01:52:09] and I have to bring up a comment a youtube comment okay so the Johnny Kim podcast
[01:52:17] on youtube and it says something like you know the title of the podcast is
[01:52:21] Johnny Kim you know seal sniper harver doctor astronaut and the first comment on youtube is
[01:52:34] dude can't hold a job which I thought was pretty funny
[01:52:43] integrity you guys talk about integrity I mean these you go through these characteristics kind of
[01:52:48] each one effective intelligence talks to me about effective intelligence what was effective
[01:52:53] intelligence compared to just plain old intelligence and I hope this has something to do with the fact
[01:52:59] that speaking of acquiring people there was a time in the late 90s where in the seal teams in the
[01:53:07] officer community I wasn't an officer yet but they were the seals were starting to get popular
[01:53:13] and they started getting really good candidates for the officer program and so they started recruiting
[01:53:20] and beyond just recruiting they started accepting all these just Ivy League Ivy League
[01:53:27] individuals you meet every every every new group of officers that we show up the seal team
[01:53:33] you know there'd be a bunch of enable academy guys because they get a bunch of the billets every year
[01:53:37] and then there'd be a bunch of guys from freaking harvered and and jail and these really smart guys and
[01:53:46] maybe they didn't have and I'm not saying this about every because some of them were great guys
[01:53:50] but not all of them have what I'm hoping is referred to in this book as effective intelligence
[01:53:55] is that someone accurate it is I'm gonna take one step back so integrity I know we sort of
[01:54:00] glossed over that Josh cotton doctor cotton is very passionate about this one he's done a lot of
[01:54:05] studies and look at the data organizations that are in you know high ethics or highly you know
[01:54:12] high in integrity the culture is much healthier than organizations that don't and I know that's
[01:54:19] sort of an obvious statement but you look at Enron yeah and I think also you you you say it seems like
[01:54:26] an obvious statement and yet there's so many organizations that let those things slide and here's
[01:54:31] the problem with letting things slide when it comes to integrity once this is you know this slippery
[01:54:37] slope sometimes they say a slippery slope fallacy because you know well just because I did this
[01:54:42] doesn't really mean I'm gonna do that the slippery slope when it comes to integrity is I think
[01:54:46] is almost unstoppable thing because you know if I let echo get away with something well now he's got
[01:54:53] something on me and now he lets me get away with something we go back and forth we go on this downward
[01:54:58] spiral and there's no one that can I once I once I give up my integrity I give up my ability to
[01:55:05] tighten anyone else's integrity up and you've also said a new standard you've put your personal
[01:55:11] stamp on approval the that behavior is now tolerated yep and you that's what makes it so hard you can't
[01:55:17] go backwards yeah you can't unring that bell it's really hard to do with all and if you have to go backwards
[01:55:22] because look you can put yourself in a situation what do you do you own it you stand up in front of
[01:55:27] the troops you say hey look I made a bad decision this is a bad personal decision I thought this
[01:55:31] was a good thing to do it didn't make sense it was the wrong thing I won't let it happen again
[01:55:36] that might be you know that's your that's your first step in trying to recover your integrity
[01:55:40] yeah but when you give it up that's why it's so you know the moral high ground the moral high ground
[01:55:47] and keeping the high ground it's talked about this the other day on EF online it's like
[01:55:52] once you give up the moral high ground it's just like being in combat you now you now are going
[01:55:59] to have to fight to get it back and it's a freaking uphill battle and there's a good chance
[01:56:04] you can't get up there anymore so you cannot give up that moral and ethical high ground it just
[01:56:11] it's it's one of the worst possible moves you can make on the battlefield and it's one of the
[01:56:15] worst possible moves you can make in life so I didn't mean to breeze over integrity like that
[01:56:20] but no doubt it's a it's a core component of what you got to be looking for in people
[01:56:26] and people don't scream for it that's the weirdest thing nobody ever asked the
[01:56:31] well I should say nobody I want to be careful on extremes there but I've watched you know
[01:56:36] the predominance of the hiring I do I manage a team but most of the hiring that I'm looking
[01:56:40] after is executive level and you know all of these offers come by and you're talking
[01:56:43] half million cash and more I mean they're their significant compensation and I don't
[01:56:49] hear anybody ask the question can you give me an example of when you had the hold the line on
[01:56:56] integrity and take the harder path even just that simple question you won't hear it in an
[01:57:03] interview process it would it would shock me if I heard it but it is so fundamental if you don't
[01:57:09] have this the rest doesn't matter if there's if the integrity's gone that's it you you cannot
[01:57:15] have a person without integrity in your organization full stop what was interesting is we were
[01:57:20] writing this book as so calm was dealing with a number of ethical issues and let's be asked a
[01:57:25] lot of them were coming from the CO community and you know we we sort of struggled hey do we have
[01:57:31] to change in the language in here but you know one individual doesn't speak for the organization
[01:57:37] but they do when they're on the front lines or front pages front page they speak for your
[01:57:42] organization and you know you mentioned Ivy League and and I feel bad sometimes because I overindex
[01:57:49] on Ivy League guys and sometimes I'm critical there there were some great CO officers that came out
[01:57:54] for certainly for sure some outstanding guys no doubt but they were more the exception than the
[01:58:00] the norm so as I'm talking to Johnny Kim Johnny was like speaking Harvard that was after he
[01:58:08] became a CEO so he gets a he gets a pass and and Johnny brought up a story in my life where I'm
[01:58:13] like Johnny that's that's not a good story so you know we're talking about buzz we're talking
[01:58:18] about Ryan and him and I or you know you could tell we're getting a little emotional on the phone
[01:58:21] he's like hey you remember that time we had a Harvard officer in our Buds class who actually
[01:58:28] worked for N-Ron but some officer you know I don't know what what what what the fascination was it like
[01:58:34] all this guy went to Harvard news with that run and you know in these in Buds and um this guy was
[01:58:41] arguably one of the smartest guys in the class now as part of Johnny um and he said that's nice
[01:58:48] this guy just alienated everyone he thought he was the smartest man in the room and he was
[01:58:57] egotistical he was an a-hole and Johnny's like so he's done the story about we're running to the
[01:59:03] chowhole and still there's like 250 to 125 people in the class in this guy knew I was a recon Marine
[01:59:11] and you know sometimes you'll run the formation there's one guy that runs to the right of the
[01:59:17] is it the left of the left left this is my yeah for marine that's pretty embarrassing so we're
[01:59:22] gonna do the left but his hands up the wall and makes an elder left one and he's singing cadence
[01:59:26] and he's just ripping on recon and Johnny's laughing on the phone because the whole class saw
[01:59:32] this guy just fall out of the main formation run out and I just took a hand you know sort of the
[01:59:37] night not the night hand but the hard hand was there over not to slap not to helmet right off his uh
[01:59:43] his head and he goes wrong across the street and he has to run over and I just took over the
[01:59:46] cadence and I'm like Johnny that was not my best man but this guy I kind of liked that moment this
[01:59:52] guy was uh he was gonna make it through a hurry he was gonna meet the physical requirements
[01:59:59] in the mental toughness requirements but the cotter a stepped in and dropped him and that's rare
[02:00:05] because he was just that toxic it that toxic and it's funny that the instructors could recognize
[02:00:13] that because usually instructors like hey he meets all these requirements we can breathe that out of them
[02:00:18] effective intelligence is the ability to use the intelligence you have in a real world setting
[02:00:25] to solve problems for which there is no playbook and that is the heart of special operations
[02:00:32] so there you know we found a study what would you guess it was the average GPA of most
[02:00:36] millionaires that went to college I have no idea 2.9 2.9 and that's my seven graces because I think
[02:00:44] I got a 2.9 on it so I'm like hey Abby so what we found in the people that are off the charts
[02:00:51] smart and what we saw in the seal teams is that they suffered a lot from the process through
[02:00:55] analysis or they made things so overly complex and when you work in high-staking environments
[02:01:02] time is usually a factor and it goes back to the second law of combat simple yeah that's that's
[02:01:10] all good stuff and again hey we're not bagging on the guys that came in and had awesome education
[02:01:17] and a lot of them were awesome and and here's another another reason that it hurt the community
[02:01:21] was because these guys would be coming in and they were had such high potential this is in the
[02:01:25] 90s there's no war going on they do four years they get they do their system of
[02:01:30] two commander they do their putton commander they look at what's ahead of them in the 90s and it was like oh
[02:01:34] you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you know ride a desk for the next 18 or whatever the
[02:01:39] next 16 years before you can retire and guys would say you know I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna go
[02:01:43] do do something else so it hurt us from a just a personnel building standpoint as well
[02:01:49] but that's uh the other thing that I've seen is where you get
[02:01:54] and look some people pull this off and they do it great but there are some people that have a problem
[02:01:58] taking their highly intellectual view of something and translating it to the frontline troops
[02:02:06] where now the people the people that have to go and execute whatever did you want them to execute
[02:02:11] is doing it in a simple clear concise right that's why simple is one of the laws of combat
[02:02:16] but you know part of the law of combat is planning keep your your planning simple the other
[02:02:20] part of that law of combat is to communicate simply and there's a lot of people that have a hard time
[02:02:24] doing not a lot there are some people that have a hard time doing that so that's a
[02:02:30] that effective intelligence is uh is definitely an important thing and that is the one I mean
[02:02:35] one of the attributes specific to Marsauk is that they called it effective intelligence and that's you know
[02:02:40] again flint we we we took that one it was the way they described it in their assessment and
[02:02:46] selection manual that that's one of their primary requirements the way they described it was absolutely
[02:02:50] beautiful. Marsauk had the advantage of having joined so calm late you know I was a recon marine
[02:02:57] we were never part of so calm back then and eventually 2000 was at five six Marsauk that one
[02:03:03] led by Colonel Kaczynski two 2004 yeah because they were leave me and Baghdad that's right
[02:03:08] and everyone's like yeah this is a no-brainer but they could look when they were building the Marsauk
[02:03:14] assessment selection course they could look at what the sealer and the SF community and they were very
[02:03:19] deliberate and that's the Marsauk community stand by they're they're they're just going to be
[02:03:23] powerful they already are yeah you know we were talking about to bring this over to the business world
[02:03:29] you know we talk about effective intelligence and people over indexing on experience they're
[02:03:36] wanting people to come and take a playbook and run it over here and and assuming that the situations
[02:03:43] that you're going to find in this particular business are going to be exactly the same and so
[02:03:48] they're thinking well they've handled these situations over here they'll be able to handle them here
[02:03:53] will be successful in the story it's the effective intelligence that's not assuming any course of action
[02:04:01] for a business problem they're looking at it that that ability to take the intellectual horsepower
[02:04:07] and look at all of the data points all of the indicators all of the little pieces of intel
[02:04:12] collect them and put them into a cohesive picture that then you explain simply with the plan of attack
[02:04:21] and it's so different than experience and if we can get people to index on that versus the experience
[02:04:28] you see the difference immediately you know George we actually we talk about the 70%
[02:04:31] solution that's a great example what you're you're explaining in a business context is again
[02:04:36] the guys that are wildly intelligent when they only have 70% of the operational picture they can't
[02:04:41] make a decision but people high in high effective intelligence can draw threads parallels and make a
[02:04:50] very decisive decision with interplayed information and you know they we pulled a quote out
[02:04:54] because we're talking to Tracy Kio and so she was talking about the CEO of Microsoft
[02:04:59] said we don't want no adults we want learn adults if you can get that how far ahead of the game are you
[02:05:07] I'm gonna I'm gonna reach into some people's brains that are listening to this right now
[02:05:13] and I'm just gonna do a little a little tweak on their brains because I promise you I promise you
[02:05:18] that there's some people that when you said hey you're talking about someone that just takes a playbook
[02:05:25] and runs the playbook and that's it I promise you that there's some people that are thinking wait that's
[02:05:30] what I want that's what I want right there I want someone who's gonna take that playbook and they're
[02:05:33] gonna run that's what they're gonna do and and I'm gonna reach in there and just I have to stop you
[02:05:38] from thinking that because I know that's what you think you want that's what that's what leaders think
[02:05:43] they think hey look I've got this all figured out if everyone would just do what I tell them to do
[02:05:47] run the playbook just do what I say to do will be good to go here's the thing there's no static
[02:05:53] function in the world that what you want is non-thinking apparatus to run a playbook and if you do
[02:06:04] if you have something like that yes automate that get a robot to do that task and do them
[02:06:08] over and over again the same way when you're hiding a leader you want them to be able to adapt
[02:06:13] and change and make improvements and do whatever they have to do to win that's what you want so if you
[02:06:19] hear George say hey we don't want someone that's just gonna run the playbook and you're thinking
[02:06:26] no way I do that do want that no you don't and this was the same thing is happen to the
[02:06:31] micro managers coming through my train when I was running training you get someone that's thinking hey
[02:06:36] look I've been I'm either I'm experienced or I know I'm highly educated I know how to run these
[02:06:41] operations so everyone if everyone just get in line and just do what I tell them to do will be
[02:06:45] good to go and what is that turned into it's micro management that you can't tell everyone what to do
[02:06:49] there's no way you can be everywhere or once and everything falls apart you need thinking shooters
[02:06:53] is what we used to call it so what what we're offering at at EF Overwatch is thinking leaders that will
[02:07:01] actually solve problems yeah you're right and and you know we made a little vignette a little video about this
[02:07:08] but coming up through the army and you know joccal I was actually one of those people that
[02:07:13] started to get out in the 90s I was I'd gotten through you know I had two years of line command
[02:07:18] and I'm thinking I love this I got to go to field I love being with my soldiers and then you
[02:07:23] didn't you know your time for a command comes up in the army and you're looking ahead and you're going
[02:07:27] now I'm gonna say something and I don't want to hear crap about it later Mike but I'm thinking
[02:07:31] I got a life of Harvard graphics ahead of me which preceded powerpoint just to bring you along
[02:07:37] with the program here but and and so I got out but I have to tell you the US army and the US military
[02:07:48] is the world's greatest leadership incubator and I owe so much back to the military to my mentors
[02:07:55] to my coaches to the soldiers to the non-commissioned officers people I served with and it created
[02:08:00] and made that thinking leader do I have all the answers no no but that the US military when we
[02:08:08] talk about it yet folks we talk about placing leaders it's you're in a fishbowl 247 365 is a
[02:08:15] leader it is the biggest and best burden you can ever carry is to be a leader in the United States
[02:08:21] military it is just it's an honor a privilege it's scariest how it's rewarding is how it's everything
[02:08:26] but you're in an incubator to lead and and I am so so grateful for that and and so when we talk
[02:08:34] about the principles in these book and when we talk about that effective intelligence the army
[02:08:39] helped me in my case deliver that that that did I know everything about the enemy no I had to take all
[02:08:45] these cues and start putting pieces together what do I have to do what are my possible courses
[02:08:49] of action what's good what's bad what's high risk what's low risk and anyway it just it is it is
[02:08:56] astounded me how much I learned to think about the art of leadership coming through the US military
[02:09:02] I mean muskets were not as intuitive during his days as you know for us we have now but we had good
[02:09:08] horses like so you know I'm good with that this is what I have to put up with daily
[02:09:12] team ability did you guys make up that work that hyphenated work team ability we did not
[02:09:21] we I think we found that within our research we we we liked it so we we stuck with yeah kind of
[02:09:28] because we were talking with Brian Decker we were talking a lot of people
[02:09:31] that you everybody had different versions of that same word so we put that together yeah the
[02:09:36] team work and how different and do you have the ability to put yourself whatever level you're at
[02:09:43] as a team player and that there's a certain element of that to be a follower as well
[02:09:47] what do we put everything like that word yeah okay yeah we came up with it
[02:09:51] good ago you say about nothing worth accomplishing it can be done alone there are no
[02:09:57] rampos in the military that might look cool in the movies but individual is die pretty quickly on
[02:10:01] the battlefield or worst get others hurt they're great success requires that we work together
[02:10:07] curiosity exploring the unknown and questioning the status quo and pursue to better
[02:10:12] more effective solutions is the key to innovation without curious individuals nothing would ever
[02:10:17] change or improve emotional strength in the US military and I'm given like these highly abbreviated
[02:10:25] definitions and you guys go into it not not only do you go into better examples but then not only
[02:10:32] not only more detailed definitions but examples you know you're talking about the rescue
[02:10:37] cap and films I mean you got really cool examples in here to back these things up but that's
[02:10:42] where people buy the books so that they can read those curiosity already covered that emotional strength
[02:10:48] in the US military the whole man concept is the belief that the individuals need to be assessed
[02:10:54] based on the entirety of their person mental physical and emotional and emotionally strong individual
[02:11:00] has a positive attitude high empathy and emotional control in stressful situations many of the
[02:11:06] individuals we interviewed identified positive attitude as important to their hiring decisions
[02:11:12] attitude is contagious positivity breeds positivity while negativity
[02:11:18] be gets more negativity an individual the negative attitude can still produce results but is often at the expense
[02:11:24] of company culture typically that one person who's also not worth the resulting damage to the team
[02:11:33] you have highlighted this section emotional strength is the ability to regulate ones emotions
[02:11:38] to remain logical under stress situations marsawk calls this stress tolerance and defines it as
[02:11:44] the ability to deal with ambiguous dangerous high pressure or frustrating events while maintaining control
[02:11:50] of emotions actions composure and effectiveness it is a universal truth in life that humans don't
[02:11:56] make good decisions in emotional state people who are able to remain cool calm and collected in the
[02:12:01] face of challenges and the unknown are people you want in your organization this is the exact reason
[02:12:06] soft creates stressful environments to mimic the conditions of war during assessment and selection
[02:12:11] programs stress tolerance is so important that some soft organizations even use heart rate
[02:12:16] monitors to evaluate individuals psychological physiological responses to stress
[02:12:26] got to stay calm got to be able to detach these were this chapter I mean you get people that
[02:12:33] are very passionate Ryan Decker was heavily involved in this chapter rich divinity
[02:12:37] geverserved with rich I did not rich is a brother very very passionate about in fact he has a book
[02:12:44] called the attributes 25 hidden drivers of optimal performance it's about attributes some of his
[02:12:50] observations like empathy you know when you think about it in the way he described it he said
[02:12:55] special operations is very good about dialing up and dialing down empathy he said it's almost like
[02:13:01] a dimmer switch when you go out on an operation in your right in the home there's a likelihood
[02:13:06] that there are women and children in there and you know you've got a dial down or empathy to
[02:13:10] accomplish the mission not you know safeguard them while while still bringing the hurt to the
[02:13:15] the combatants you're known after um yet we're very good about down that empathy back up when we
[02:13:20] come back from from from uh operations so um very detailed conversations very passionate about these
[02:13:27] these subjects and um those two were instrumental in uh in the chapter yeah you guys dug into
[02:13:34] some like I said good stuff and obviously going with getting those dead information for good people
[02:13:42] creating a talent acquisition plan talk to me about that well you know one of the many
[02:13:52] mistakes that you know once you get past you know making sure that your chief human resources
[02:13:58] chief human resource officer is strategic and tied into your CEO you have to look
[02:14:04] ahead you know at that old adage if you if you fail to plan you're planning to fail people look
[02:14:13] at talent and recruiting and staffing is hey we've got these open positions let's crank it there's
[02:14:18] not often a plan behind it and that starts with looking at your company and it starts with going okay
[02:14:25] what is the strength of our company when it comes to talent what gaps do we have what gaps do we
[02:14:31] have in leadership what gaps do we have in technology what gaps do we have in sales in leaders
[02:14:35] in individual contributors do we have key points of failure do we have only one person that can do
[02:14:41] this job and if they go we've nobody to step up do we have number two do we have number three
[02:14:47] okay where are we gonna grow where are we gonna grow next year and you know this could go on and on
[02:14:52] and on but the basics are is you need to be sitting down and looking at each organization and what
[02:14:58] are you missing why are you winning in that department why are you winning in sales why are you winning
[02:15:03] in product why are you winning in service or whatever and find out what your gaps are and that's
[02:15:08] where you start with talent and get that down into a plan that says okay we're gonna go after this
[02:15:14] in a strategic way we are gonna go out into the market you know we're gonna look within our own
[02:15:19] organization first but then we're gonna go out to the market and we're gonna build an organization
[02:15:23] in talent acquisition HR that says these are the people that are the gatekeepers and they are
[02:15:29] going to find and they are gonna know what our success profiles look like and they are gonna
[02:15:34] bring us high caliber people with those character attributes to be considered for these positions
[02:15:40] but you plan it out first is going oh you know what hey we have an open position over here you
[02:15:46] know we've authorized 10 head count in this particular department you've got an empty seat what
[02:15:51] do you need that's not a plan that's just that's a button to see like we talked about
[02:15:56] you you have to take that time to say what does my organization look like as far as talent and people
[02:16:02] it's one of the many things that because everybody's focused on everything else they don't take the
[02:16:06] time to go what's gonna bring us into 21 what's gonna bring us into 22 you and like Don Roberts
[02:16:13] and said in our book you have to be higher for the skills and needs of the future where your company
[02:16:17] is gonna go and I think we even brought it up it's like the term is fighting in the last war
[02:16:23] you know you're not thinking ahead is to what you're gonna need and so there's no plan to go
[02:16:26] after that and build that for the future this is one of those things where you it happens to
[02:16:32] echelon front sometimes be working with a company and and you know they're whatever company is
[02:16:37] it happens all the time companies caught up in that firefight day to day they're trying to survive
[02:16:40] they're trying to make things happen they got projects do they got all the things going on and then
[02:16:44] you know you ask them about you know hey do you do you have anyone that's looking at you know
[02:16:50] six months down the line about where you're gonna be about what supplies you're gonna need or whatever
[02:16:54] just whatever those and and you can see their caught their caught like on their heels because they don't
[02:16:59] and if you if you think about what you're talking about here a talent acquisition plan how we're
[02:17:05] actually going to build a company and you think about how many companies are out there
[02:17:10] that the way they think about is just it's a fire fight right we need to fill this seat right now
[02:17:17] that's the plan the plan is hire someone to do that role next week we have a new plan the plan is
[02:17:22] hire someone to keep fill this other role yep there's no unified long-term strategic plan of what we're
[02:17:27] doing and what is the military do better than well there's many things they do better than most
[02:17:32] there's always a pipeline there's always a pipeline there's always a plan there's a succession plan
[02:17:38] there is a pipeline of high quality people coming into a pipeline so we can assess and select and put them into
[02:17:44] those things it's it's a forethought we have people that are out there doing that stuff but they're actually
[02:17:50] thinking what do we need for 21 22 23 24 25 won't even that goes all the way out the systems in equipment
[02:17:58] and but the military does it all whereas corporations will go to your point they're out there firefighting
[02:18:04] oh wow wow I've got an opening on team I got to bring somebody in but if you do have an opening on
[02:18:09] your team it should be hey we got a pipeline already talent that's banging out the door to get
[02:18:13] into this place because we have a talent mindset we have leadership we are focused we empower our
[02:18:18] people we lead our people we drive our people we win and people will want to be a part of that
[02:18:23] yeah you guys break it down and hear what you have to do what you have to do to create this
[02:18:28] talent acquisition plan defining greatness in your organization identify your high performance
[02:18:33] as a session talent objective assessments just you guys go line by line and explain all these things
[02:18:39] in great detail build your talent profiles mic you already mentioned that workforce plan I mean you
[02:18:44] just go through the detail so that people that don't have a plan can actually open up this book
[02:18:51] and put a plan together so that they're moving forward with a route right with a route instead
[02:18:57] of just moving forward in the blind which is crazy to think about and yet it happens all the time it's
[02:19:03] just start with the conversation the senior leaders and companies are not having this conversation
[02:19:10] and that's where it starts there's many ways to go about this you don't need to bring you know
[02:19:14] bring in a top five consulting firm yes you can bring in the info for watching that's my plug
[02:19:19] but you know this this isn't something where you're going to bring in you know industrial
[02:19:23] organizational psychologists and you're going to create assessments that are going to solve this for you
[02:19:27] this is this is this is basic leadership that you have to have the discipline to fall through on
[02:19:32] and you can create these processes from scratch special operations community how to start somewhere
[02:19:37] they basically started from scratch and you can build this it's going to take time
[02:19:41] but you have to have those conversations and you have to have those conversations all the time
[02:19:45] every every week every month are we selecting not only for what we need now but five years
[02:19:51] don't mind if you're creating a town profile how does that top profile change with the digital
[02:19:56] transformation five years from now what's going to be required in terms of attributes five years
[02:20:01] down the road or ten years down the road? Next section is about attracting top talent what talented
[02:20:12] people look for attracting talent requires knowing what talented people want many companies assume
[02:20:18] that the answer is money and perks they offer competitive salaries and wonderful
[02:20:21] creature comforts high end expression machines fully stocked kitchens pool tables and more
[02:20:27] and yet they still have rich talent on the other end we've seen countless people turn down
[02:20:32] higher pay to stay with the company where they feel challenged and love the people they work with
[02:20:37] if you want people to dedicate their talents to your company you must offer something equally
[02:20:43] valuable in return since talented people have high drive they are interested they're just as
[02:20:48] interested in achievement and challenge as money let's not fool ourselves if your compensation
[02:20:54] benefits are not competitive within your industry you'll lose out on talent but attracting top
[02:20:58] people goes beyond that beyond money talented people look for talented leaders and colleagues
[02:21:03] a sense of community a challenge opportunities for professional and personal growth and purpose
[02:21:09] talent attracts talent it's a magnet good leaders or you want to go even in my military career
[02:21:17] I know who those good leaders are and I'm like oh I got to get that organization because they're
[02:21:21] going to help me get to the next level they're going to pass on that experience that coaching the
[02:21:25] mentorship I did that in the military I do it here in the corporate world I've been doing it for
[02:21:29] 20 years you know one of the people in this book I actually followed to another organization he's like hey
[02:21:34] hey I'm like I'm there I'm there you know he goes do you want to talk about the
[02:21:39] compensation I said no let's just move let's go and the great part is is that you know there's
[02:21:47] a lot of bad habits that get you into a vicious cycle but attracting great talent gets you into a
[02:21:54] positive cycle of attracting better talent all the time you're alumni in the people currently
[02:22:02] in your organization are the best way to attract talent hands down I mean you're doing it right now
[02:22:09] you've probably caused a lot of young men and women to in list or seek missions in the military
[02:22:17] based off the lessons that are learning but yes that is a factual statement there we go there's a lot
[02:22:22] of a lot of people out there that are straight up in the military from listening to podcast
[02:22:28] because I hear from all the time it's awesome in fact we're having dinner last night Air Force
[02:22:32] individual came up and said hey I follow everything you do thank you for what you do and then he
[02:22:38] asks he handed me the phone said hey can you take a picture of Jack and I might say really he's like yeah
[02:22:44] okay so you tell the story and this is a hundred percent true I didn't come from the military
[02:22:51] lineage I didn't I'd seen the movies that they were pretty cool I thought the military was potentially a
[02:22:59] path for me there was multiple paths the backup dancer from Madonna was just not going to be a
[02:23:05] career that provided you know what I needed to live so I wouldn't know that it inside Joe it's
[02:23:11] it's also frightening mental image I assure you there's a sequence on somewhere in his house so
[02:23:23] 18 and living in Colorado I ran into I'm not gonna mention his name which is called staff sergeant Ben
[02:23:30] staff sergeant Ben was attending the University of Colorado on the meat set program which is the same
[02:23:36] program I eventually attended a tech say them the Marine and Listic Commission education program
[02:23:40] where they take the enlisted seven to get their degrees in the ultimately uh earn a commission
[02:23:46] so I met Ben and at the age of 18 here you have the staff sergeant from the force recon community
[02:23:53] and he was humbly confident he was articulate highly respectful to everyone what differentiated
[02:24:00] him from the other Marines was even though he was you know this dual cool you know highly
[02:24:05] decorated is he was actually nicer than the other Marines he had nothing to prove and physically
[02:24:11] the whole man concept he was there he had a stature about him and when I made team I'm like
[02:24:17] dude that guy's awesome that's who I want to be that's who I want to be and I mean to the point
[02:24:24] where I enlisted in the Marine court have come a recon ring because of the image because of the
[02:24:30] person the Marine court put forward in front of young men and women like me when you have strong
[02:24:36] leaders stepping up representing their communities it it sends a very strong message to people
[02:24:42] that I want to join that and it never changed when I went to infantry school you know seven
[02:24:47] recon ring stepped in front of us and said who wants to screen the front recon and like oh my god it's
[02:24:51] like seven staff sergeant Ben's and then when I finally met the seals you know walls in the
[02:24:57] Marine court I'm like oh my god that's my next challenge and your alumni and current employees
[02:25:04] or team members are your greatest recruiting to it always yeah I was I've had many conversations
[02:25:11] with businesses as you know they're losing somebody somebody decide to leave and they start thinking
[02:25:18] about we're gonna end them with the no compete we're gonna get them with this we're gonna get
[02:25:21] them with that and I say I got a better idea why don't you wish them luck and thank them for what they
[02:25:28] did while they were here and let them go about it away because if you send them out the door with a
[02:25:34] kick in the ass they're not coming back if you send them out the door and say good luck it's been
[02:25:39] great working with you first of all they're not gonna go out in the street and say you know oh
[02:25:43] joc was a jerk you don't want to work for him it's gonna go I left them but they're good people
[02:25:47] right and that those people will come back to you by the way I mean eventually they're gonna come back
[02:25:52] because you know somebody is over the reason they're leaving us because if you're treating people
[02:25:56] well the reason people are leaving us because someone is lying to them you know they're lying they're
[02:26:00] giving them some lying that they're not gonna be able to uphold so when people are leaving it's
[02:26:06] it's your alumni you got a treat them like you're alumni and say hey good luck let me know if you
[02:26:10] never need anything you know even though you're working for a competitor it's all right you know
[02:26:14] what are my friends yeah you know well we we took a one step further we have some of the uh
[02:26:19] the just great members of my team about 90 days down the road they'll call them up where they went
[02:26:26] hey how are things going for you hey was it everything that you expected I hope your
[02:26:32] experiencing great success and it's everything because there's people that move along because
[02:26:35] for whatever reason they're next challenge maybe somewhere else and you have to be accepting of that
[02:26:40] and you and you have to to your point encourage that too and if you have good number two you're
[02:26:45] falling you don't worry about it but reach out to somebody and say hey how are you doing you know what
[02:26:49] hey if things aren't going well there hey give me a call give me a call because we love to have
[02:26:53] it in your hair you wouldn't believe how many people are going you know what they don't have to admit
[02:26:58] that they made a mistake they're going you know what it wasn't as good it wasn't as good
[02:27:03] we we call we we call the ultimate litmus test it's if there's pride in the organization whether
[02:27:09] you're with the organization at that time or whatever look at the Marine Corps when somebody says hey
[02:27:14] you know what you do while I'm a former Marine they they're proclaimed proclaim that vice
[02:27:20] somebody say hey I'm a I'm a coder no if if they're pride prideful in the organization they say
[02:27:25] I'm a Googler and so when they identify with the organization it's one they're sort of identifying
[02:27:31] that there's a talent oriented culture and that there's strong leadership at that company to the
[02:27:36] point where they have a sense of pride and that becomes a talent magnet for other people at that
[02:27:41] cocktail party that you said it so very powerful we we can't sort of over index on that one enough
[02:27:50] no it it's just you know everybody in your company is a talent scout everybody in your company is an
[02:27:56] example of what you hold as important especially your leaders when they're out in the public
[02:28:03] and everybody should always be looking we talked about this like you know the term is
[02:28:09] opportunistic hiring most people are only hiring for an open position but if you've got talent
[02:28:14] scouts out there they're bringing talent to you and saying you know what dispersions a difference
[02:28:18] maker this isn't a player we have got to find a place in our organization so everybody when you have
[02:28:23] a talent mindset it's not just you know from the CEO down all the way through that you've got
[02:28:28] them mechanics and you're looking for top talent but it's all your employees once they're in the door
[02:28:34] they're branding going hey you want to come try out here this is a tough place to work and and that's
[02:28:39] exactly what happens in the special operations community there is no shortage of people signing up
[02:28:44] to get a beating no shortage whatsoever and in an ideal world if you have a company with that
[02:28:50] kind of mindset you'll have those people going you know what I got to work there because that that's
[02:28:54] going to make me better either jockey you brought a point about when somebody leaves your organization
[02:28:59] you show them respect and try to keep that relationship intact what we found great organizations
[02:29:05] do even in the hiring process if they don't hire somebody is they spill still spend time to say
[02:29:10] hey we love to debrief you on why we didn't select you for this position and they show them a
[02:29:14] great deal of respect the special operations community does this when somebody drops from the
[02:29:19] buds they do pull them aside and they have a conversation hey what do you want to do in the
[02:29:22] Navy what have you learned from this process and they speak highly of the seals or the special forces
[02:29:27] selection process when they leave we've seen organizations that are so highly respectful to people
[02:29:33] that they don't even hire that at the end of the debrief they say wow no other organization has
[02:29:39] done that for me they just simply do some don't even respond or some just say hey we didn't
[02:29:43] select you next and they said it's not uncommon organizations that sort of follow this this tactic
[02:29:49] it's part of their culture with the person looks at him and says do you have any other positions
[02:29:53] available in that in the organization and literally make hires based off that by showing them such
[02:29:59] a great experience during that hiring process it drives me nuts to have a bad process because
[02:30:05] effectively and especially in today's era of social digital media that experience is your brand
[02:30:12] going back out in the marketplace and you've created an impression you've created a customer
[02:30:17] consumer or you've pushed one away if you didn't select them so it you know how you treat people
[02:30:24] in the process it says everything about your company says everything about having a talent mindset
[02:30:29] yeah and the bottom line with all these things that we're talking about all these behaviors is
[02:30:33] you're you have a culture that people that are talented are gonna want to go to and that's what
[02:30:38] this you know this section's about a sense of community the challenge the growth opportunities
[02:30:44] having a purpose there salary and benefits given people ownership given people control over their
[02:30:49] own destiny and that all those things you kind of sum up here with brand yourself as a talent
[02:30:55] magnet the US military especially special operations has skillful marketing and branding which
[02:30:59] is very weird for me to say but I know it's very true they're branding I mean let's face it the
[02:31:04] Marine Corps is branding itself way before branding was a thing same with the army I mean I remember
[02:31:10] I was totally brainwashed when I was a kid to be all you can be or the few the proberines like
[02:31:16] that was just 100% just my whole branding in my mind is stuck to this day you know the few
[02:31:24] the proberines Rangers lead the way that others may live day of press or lever lever how do you
[02:31:31] say that can't we we can't say that they the press or lever is that right I think you got it right
[02:31:36] yes sorry Tim Kennedy bro I'm sorry Tim Kennedy day a presso lever there you go to free the
[02:31:43] oppressed the only easy day with yesterday and what you're doing with these things is is the other
[02:31:50] the other big part of this is employee value proposition what you as an employee as employer
[02:31:57] offer to your employees and you kind of you kind of lay out some you lay out one price waterhouse
[02:32:03] coovers from empowering mentorships to customize coaching PWC provide you with the support you need
[02:32:12] to help you develop your career you'll work with people from diverse backgrounds and industries
[02:32:17] to solve important problems are you ready to grow here's the here's the Ranger one recognizing
[02:32:22] that I volunteered as a Ranger fully knowing the hazards of my chosen profession I will always
[02:32:27] endure to uphold the prestige honor and high a speed of core of the Rangers acknowledging the fact
[02:32:33] that a Ranger is a more elite soldier who arrives at the cutting edge of battle by land sea or air
[02:32:39] I accept the fact that as a Ranger my country expects me to move further faster and fight harder
[02:32:44] than any other soldier Rangers lead the way branding I hate calling that stuff brand and because it's so
[02:32:52] badass using social media to reach top talent all right let's hear it guys you guys
[02:33:02] apparently you know you just talked about this what we talked about last night with so come
[02:33:06] doing oh yeah so come and starting a podcast who did they reach out to they reach out to me but
[02:33:13] yeah it's very cool what they're doing you know they've got a they they just wanted to you know get my kind
[02:33:16] of cut on it and very cool what they're trying to do you know they're just trying to get the word out there
[02:33:21] and and then you pointed out to me that whatever a year ago so come started an Instagram account
[02:33:28] so we see our own special operations community building their social media presence so that they can
[02:33:36] communicate with the next generation of special operations humans the military has been
[02:33:42] pretty good about this so back in the late nineties or mid nineties ex games was
[02:33:49] really coming to to to to to fruition and the military started creating their own extreme sports teams
[02:33:56] because that's where they knew the new talent is that that's where that you know the demographic
[02:34:01] of the 18 or I'm sorry let's say 15 year olds to the 25 year olds was was pushing towards that
[02:34:07] time where do you think the military is going now for recruiting video games e-sports teams
[02:34:16] they're putting e-sports teams together now if you asked our generation when they said hey we're
[02:34:20] going to go recruit out of the e-sports or video game town pools we'd probably say
[02:34:24] no way yeah that future seals and future marsawk you know Raiders and special forces are not
[02:34:33] going to come out of this communities that's wrong that's that's where the new talent lays not all
[02:34:38] that they're still town out there playing sports you know on teams wrestling but you know
[02:34:44] that's just this new generation they play a lot of video games and that's where they're they're
[02:34:49] finding success with their recruiting yeah I'm curious about that video games make me nervous
[02:34:56] because people get addicted to them and yeah it's really it's a real thing it's a real thing
[02:35:02] so let's be honest yeah it missed my generation my my dad was not big on video games in the
[02:35:08] house we didn't have it that's why when I would go to my friends house I would stay up till four
[02:35:12] while they were sleeping playing the video games Nintendo my guidance on punch out but what did
[02:35:17] the guys usually do when we got back from operations oh bro I mean my first deployment to
[02:35:21] Iraq they had Halo set up between tents and then they had this so seals I was already like
[02:35:27] like you guys are playing video games what do you wait what is this what are you guys doing pack man
[02:35:31] I mean I don't know I'm so out of it I'm from you know back then you were really
[02:35:36] back so I'm thinking what is this so I like I went in there looked in so you see whatever
[02:35:40] the guys are playing Halo and and I just didn't really get it and I thought it was just weird
[02:35:46] couple you know five or six seals that were all into it but then they had a siege so different
[02:35:51] tournament of Halo did you hear what I just said we're in Iraq we're on deployment we're fighting
[02:35:57] the enemy and they have a at the command of joint special operations task force for Iraq
[02:36:05] they have a Halo tournament so that's a little bit embarrassing so it's embarrassing that I got
[02:36:10] seals doing it it's even more embarrassing that they have a siege so different and the height of
[02:36:15] embarrassment was when my two players went up there for the tournament not only did they win
[02:36:22] they utterly destroyed everyone and I guess in that game you you in the game Halo the version
[02:36:28] that they were playing you have to get to 50 kills and in the finals these two guys in the finals
[02:36:35] they killed the opponent 50 times and they got killed the ones and they came back and they were
[02:36:41] super stoked and I just was I was like gentlemen I'm very disappointed what's really crazy is
[02:36:48] just I mean great guys and one of them was a total freaking physical stuff the other one was
[02:36:53] when I bad asked you know pipeting seals so they were awesome guys so I don't know maybe I'm
[02:36:57] misjudged and it does make me nervous because people get addicted to those video games
[02:37:03] yeah kind of for the same reason they get addicted to other stuff too though a lot of the time
[02:37:08] because they don't have like other stuff going on necessarily but I don't know it's been kind of
[02:37:13] proven to that video games are like a good method of problem solving like in your brain so people
[02:37:20] it's true they can be conducive in certain circumstances why don't you say that you're
[02:37:25] gonna do some problems solving all very there's that too but you get guys to play video games
[02:37:30] and you just so you see what I'm saying I'm saying it can be it can have a little roll in there
[02:37:35] I just have a little roll has you said have you been good at any video game ever in your whole life
[02:37:39] you like Charlie I tried playing with these guys I would take two steps and die yeah you're talking
[02:37:45] my halo that ones like okay that's that ones kind of advanced like you mentioned Mike Tyson punch show
[02:37:51] yeah I never never admitted to that who meant Mike doesn't did you mention that yeah
[02:37:54] well it's too bad a beat like Tyson punch show I beat Mike Tyson punch out and regular punch out you know
[02:38:00] what the what the differences nothing really except one is the last guys Mike Tyson you know
[02:38:07] brown guy and then on regular punch out the last guy's Mr. Dream same exact pixel formation of the guy
[02:38:14] except he's a little lighter because that's when I think Mike Tyson ran into some problem
[02:38:19] publicly I think with the law and whatnot you know but yeah I think they just had a
[02:38:25] documentary come out on the evolution of video games for the reflex yeah
[02:38:31] shit check but thank you for staying up for this generation yes sir yeah
[02:38:36] all right moving back to the subject at hand it's I did this I have it not there everywhere
[02:38:42] creating the hiring team creating the hiring team is one of the most important decisions
[02:38:47] to make in the talent war but we see companies make the same form of stakes again and again
[02:38:51] here they are B players or C players being put in charge of hiring you already kind of mentioned that
[02:38:59] that's not a universal statement but it does happen the hiring team is homogeneous
[02:39:09] homogeneous homogeneous homogeneous there we go thank you actual Charles tighten up
[02:39:15] the English major over there the hiring team is homogeneous which means what we've got
[02:39:21] a team here and they're all they're all all engineers the same people all engineers the all sales
[02:39:26] people wanted to one together look or to put it in the context of special operations if you just
[02:39:30] selected breachers to be the team of people selecting not not not not the point man
[02:39:35] not the navigator yeah your breachers are going to look for future breachers number three there's
[02:39:42] no training what's the training that you're talking about you know how to dig in and first of all
[02:39:50] and you know i've got to say this is that every time you hire there are legal ramifications
[02:39:56] i could tell you horror stories about asking the wrong questions
[02:40:03] no it's great actually i had i literally had a senior hiring manager go in and there was a
[02:40:08] lady they came in and one of his questions was is winner you do and i'm like really and yeah she
[02:40:14] wasn't pregnant so that made that just she got an offer on the spot for me we saved the company a
[02:40:19] couple million dollars and a lawsuit but the training you have to teach people to make sure that
[02:40:23] you're asking questions that are simply job related and performance related number one but number two
[02:40:28] how do you dig in and examine those questions how do you put that person under pressure how do you
[02:40:34] pressure test them and train your hiring managers otherwise you get five guys on the engineering team
[02:40:40] and to my example five breachers who are all asking questions about breaching you're asking engineers
[02:40:45] and they're all asking sit different well how did you do this at this company they go to the next
[02:40:50] person you get candidates to come out go well i answered same questions seven times and hopefully
[02:40:55] i got a right six out of seven times but you need to train your interviewing team as to what
[02:41:01] your success profile is and you know there are nine attributes but those you're not looking for
[02:41:07] all nine maybe it's three maybe it's four maybe it's two for this specific role how are you going to
[02:41:13] dig in on those and illicit responses that tell you are they a person of high drive are they a
[02:41:18] person of high resiliency are they adaptable do they have team ability how are you digging in
[02:41:25] and which characteristics you're looking for depend on what the success profile of that particular
[02:41:29] role is and you have to train people to do that interviewing is not a skill that people just
[02:41:34] out of thin air can do very very well it takes time to train and the more you train those people
[02:41:40] the you know the more clear they become on selecting the best candidate that's in front of them
[02:41:46] for that role so training them to that process what is the process that works for you
[02:41:51] for this organization you're you're you're hiring team of a players needs to understand the process
[02:41:56] and then they under they need to understand as it's just talking about is what are you looking
[02:42:01] for during that process so Brian Decker with the SFAS they would continually go through training as they
[02:42:06] came up with obstacles and identifying that hey the reason we're putting them through this specific
[02:42:11] obstacle is we're looking for these two attributes and this is how you judge based off the score
[02:42:17] card where they they they score on that attribute so that's the the training we're talking about
[02:42:23] let let me say this one thing we say a players because a true a player has humility
[02:42:30] the ability to look at a bunch of young seal candidates or a bunch of future employees and say
[02:42:37] that macro right there she has the potential to be a lot better than I am and she's going to
[02:42:42] make me she's going to raise my performance as well she's going to raise the bar and she's going to
[02:42:46] challenge me a players can do that because they want competition they want healthy competition they
[02:42:51] want to be surrounded by other a players you put B players your C players what we're saying there
[02:42:56] is again because back to you know fear based hiring is I don't want to be outshined that that
[02:43:00] Johnny Kim right there I will be a non-player in the organization if he's there we're not taking
[02:43:06] them that's what that's what that's what what happens and so when you have ego and you have people
[02:43:11] that are mediocre performers in charge of your hiring guess what you're going to get mediocre tell
[02:43:18] the last mistake that people make is hiring as a secondary function
[02:43:23] so we're not going to take jocca willing as a troop commander the task commander say hey
[02:43:30] you got to train to go to war oh hey by the way you've got to cut over the buds every day at
[02:43:34] three p.m. to assist with the assessment selection you can't do the phrase in the military two
[02:43:41] things you need one thing well yeah we take in this this is hard to take one of our
[02:43:46] times we take a players off the battlefield guys who want to continue going to war and we say hey
[02:43:51] for the next two years actually you're going to have a greater impact on the community your soul job
[02:43:56] your one thing it's an out of secondary function this is your primary function for the next two years
[02:44:00] or six months is focusing on filling the talent and assessing the selected people in the
[02:44:07] organization that's what it means by a secondary function and then you can score it and then you can
[02:44:11] do a feedback loop if you've got the same people and I mean you'll have multiple teams across
[02:44:16] multiple departments but once you've seen how they interview if if each one of those talented
[02:44:22] candidates is going through the same group of people and getting the same structure you can go back
[02:44:27] and evaluate the results you can get that feedback loop okay we hired this person how did they do
[02:44:34] or we hired this person and they didn't do well what did we miss in the process and you're going
[02:44:38] back to the same group of people is how to iterate a little bit better and you get a little bit
[02:44:43] better each time but if you keep changing that team out you're effectively you have no standard
[02:44:50] or you get the standard of the day with the team that you put together but if you get those a
[02:44:55] players you make hiring the priority for what they do you train them properly you can look at how
[02:45:02] we're doing and how do we exponentially increase what they're doing that's hard for a business
[02:45:07] leader to sometimes very hard very very hard so what you tell me to do is take my best salesman
[02:45:13] or saleswoman take them off the line for six months and have them focus on hiring the next
[02:45:19] generation of sales leaders and our answer is yes in the short term a tactical mindset that may hurt
[02:45:28] if you have a strategic mindset for the long term for the long run if he hires
[02:45:33] three or four solid sales leaders that's going to have a much more exponential effect
[02:45:40] and impact on the organization again that's hard to do it was hard for the sealed community
[02:45:45] to take guys like you off the battlefield and say hey we need you to run training now
[02:45:48] we know where you wanted to be and so again a lot of this is getting
[02:45:54] that we say talent mindset getting business leaders just to make that mental paradigm shift
[02:45:58] of how do that tactical mindset into a strategic mindset to play the long game and that's what
[02:46:04] the talent war is it's the long game it's just that important it you know everything in your
[02:46:10] environment your your product your service the economy the market the global conditions are
[02:46:15] going to change and they're going to change rapidly but those nine attributes don't change
[02:46:21] and they allow you to confront any circumstance as a business with confidence and a win
[02:46:30] those things just won't change everything around you will change but those leadership principles
[02:46:35] those nine character attributes those are the foundations and they will let you attack and win
[02:46:40] in any given situation when you don't pay attention to them you're firefighting
[02:46:45] covid comes along oh my god what do we do everybody's you know chicken little's and and it
[02:46:50] becomes a very difficult problem to solve versus okay got it Roger that's today's situation
[02:46:55] let's go next section here's characters revealed at one's limits and there's a subsection
[02:47:04] called mic feels the pressure this is it Mike thought staring up the rope i'm going to fail out of
[02:47:10] buds because of a freaking rope two weeks prior mic it completed hell week the instructors had
[02:47:16] even pulled them aside and said you're one of the standout leaders in the class we know what
[02:47:19] you can do as a leader so we need you to step aside so that we can test and evaluate other officers
[02:47:24] yet now mic was struggling to climb a basic rope like he had been climbing since day one of the
[02:47:29] Marine Corps he had been climbing ropes for years and he was good at it he'd never failed to get
[02:47:34] up one until now for the first time in training mic was displaying serious signs of fatigue it was
[02:47:40] an ideal moment to test him so the instructors dug in shouting up at him the other students who had
[02:47:47] already completed the exercise watched from their nearby formation mic started up the rope again
[02:47:52] he could sense all eyes on him he could feel the pressure he made it ten feet and dropped
[02:47:58] the instructors kept yelling and mic started up the rope again and again and again mic was frustrated
[02:48:06] he felt like a dirt bag for not being able to get up the rope but there was no way he was going to
[02:48:10] quit he started up the rope again and fell again he got to his feet and prepared to start
[02:48:16] up the rope again but the instructors stopped him and pulled him aside out of view from the other students
[02:48:22] it's okay we all have these days one of the instructors said we wanted to apply some pressure to you
[02:48:28] to see how you would react and whether you would quit the instructors didn't really care whether mic
[02:48:35] made it to the top of the rope or not good little test see where it's at that that day and again
[02:48:44] I'd been in the Marine Corps for what five years at this point climb plenty of ropes was going to
[02:48:49] climb the ropes I remember that day just something with the body was off I had zero energy and
[02:48:56] you talk about feeling like the eyes were on me it was almost near tears not not from the pressure
[02:49:05] but I would just spent all that together I was I was done and I mean it just reinforces the point
[02:49:13] that you know you say character cannot be created where none exists and you truly don't know people
[02:49:20] until you push them to the limits that's not just physical limits that's also mental limits
[02:49:25] and that's the point of the special operations assessment and selection it's not because we're
[02:49:30] sadistic maybe we are a little but it's not to put these young men and women through
[02:49:36] you know paying for our benefit there's a purpose behind it much like an interview process
[02:49:42] is we know that once we can push them to the threshold that's our moment okay now we're going to see
[02:49:48] if this individual has what it takes if they have the right attributes one of the things in
[02:49:52] you go back to the attributes one of one of our colleagues Jason Tuchen you know you talked about
[02:49:57] resiliency the whole point of a lot of you know the special operations assessment selection is to see
[02:50:02] how resilient people are he talked about in buds attracts much like the other special operations
[02:50:07] some pretty phenomenal human beings like NCAA athletes and Olympic athletes and when he ran
[02:50:14] first phase he saw a lot of these you know what people consider exceptional athletes quit
[02:50:21] and he said they were low on resiliency because this was the first time they had failed
[02:50:26] in their life and that's a point in the training as he says just to keep knocking people down
[02:50:30] to see how they react and when you have a high achiever who's never really experienced failure
[02:50:36] and they repeatedly fail in buds or these other assessment programs sometimes they quit
[02:50:43] and that's what you're looking for but somebody who's experienced nothing but obstacles in their
[02:50:50] life is well is more prepared for what they face in special operations and more equipped to deal
[02:50:55] with crisis than some of these exceptional athletes who just never really face challenge.
[02:51:02] Yeah you're gonna fail some stuff they're gonna make sure you fail some stuff 100% like you're not
[02:51:08] going to pass everything not care who you are they're going to make you sure you fail some stuff
[02:51:12] to make sure that when you do fail something you don't lose the bubble you talk a little bit about
[02:51:18] the interview process and you go into the interview process here and here's a strategy on
[02:51:25] on you go a bunch of stuff I'm gonna skip to one part for guidance on strategy look to special
[02:51:30] operations murder boards murder boards are not quite as terrifying as they sound they are full
[02:51:36] of pressure but professionally run and operators sits on one side of the table and on the other side
[02:51:42] is a psychologist and five to eight senior enlisted and officers representing the entire community
[02:51:49] the psychologist has previously assessed the operator to identify potential red flags
[02:51:54] the senior panel then digs in raising the pressure by probing the red flags and presenting
[02:51:59] complex scenarios they ask difficult questions and push against sore spots to see how the
[02:52:04] operator reacts if you approach your interviews a little more like a soft murder board you can
[02:52:10] reveal valuable information to that end we have five tips number one know what you're looking for
[02:52:17] with each question number two create a core set of questions to be used with each candidate number three
[02:52:24] ask scenario based and behavioral questions number four add challenges number five push candidates
[02:52:31] outside their comfort zone gotta be careful on the legal side of this huh George you did you do
[02:52:41] and and that's where you know that training comes in that we talked about earlier you people
[02:52:45] have to understand you know hiring decisions there's a lot of law around it and so you want to
[02:52:52] train those people effectively but you can create an enormous amount of pressure on somebody by
[02:52:56] asking them difficult questions and you know it's funny when we're when when we're teaching
[02:53:01] veteran candidates do you the number one candidate or the number one question that stumps people
[02:53:07] executives and military people alike I'll just ask a simple question tell me about your leadership
[02:53:12] style and people think from muscle memory they have muscle memory they oh I should be able to answer
[02:53:17] this and they go on and on and on and on and on I get that with the exact I get that with veterans
[02:53:21] but push people to to describe themselves put them in uncomfortable situations talk about failures
[02:53:27] tell me about a time that you failed and there's several executives that if you can't talk about
[02:53:33] how you failed and failed miserably and got back up and what you learned from it that's a person
[02:53:39] you need to avoid but yeah there's there's a lot of law around it but if you know what you're looking
[02:53:44] for with each question you plan your questions you plan your inner you know your interviewing
[02:53:48] panel your murder board you can create a lot of pressure but mind you there's a balance too
[02:53:53] because you you don't want to make it like the military version of it because candidates go okay
[02:53:58] I'm not working there but there's you can carve a simple balance where they know they're
[02:54:02] going to be tested in your environment and those people that know they're going to be tested in
[02:54:07] your environment the right people are going to be drawn to your environment because of that test
[02:54:12] any any person who's of talent that's worth their salt that comes to an easy interview process
[02:54:17] and rocks it in the back of their head when they walk out the doors are going okay that was a little
[02:54:21] bit easy and so now they're starting to think about okay that's that was a little too easy
[02:54:26] but a person with true talent that wants to be challenged it wants to be valued and you know
[02:54:31] working in an environment where there's the grind in the drive that tough process they're going to
[02:54:36] go okay I'm ready for this bring it let's go let's do this and you find out a lot by putting
[02:54:42] people under pressure in that scenario and let's dispel the notion that you know we call it a murder
[02:54:47] board and you've you've been on them people aren't y'all in edge yeah and I'm just out of that
[02:54:51] and and they're looking if you've given the answer they whether they like it or not they're
[02:54:56] they're going to dig a little in a very professional manner and and some murder boards go
[02:55:00] quickly because they identify that this person's humble and they're admitting you know past mistakes
[02:55:05] and that they learn from it and that they're they're still working progress and improving
[02:55:09] and there's murder boards go quickly it's the others where somebody comes in they're overly confident
[02:55:13] they're arrogant and so that's where people that are trained to assess those behaviors and this
[02:55:18] is one big behavioral interview this is the military's version of a behavioral interview those go
[02:55:24] very long and it it almost becomes like a confessional they just they just keep digging themselves
[02:55:31] now another tactic to that is after you put the person through a murder board it's like one
[02:55:36] person goes out and say hey what how'd you feel about that process what what do you think you
[02:55:40] can do better what areas didn't you expand upon to see now if they can do a what do we call
[02:55:45] a brutally honest self assessment like hey you know what man I wish I could do that again
[02:55:50] I missed this this I didn't reinforce this point and so if that person's training they come back in
[02:55:54] and say hey real real self reflective after action that they just gave and one of the reasons
[02:56:01] that we put this specific technique in there is because most interviews and companies are done
[02:56:06] on a one-to-one basis and Jocco echo I bet I you could I could put you in one of these murder
[02:56:13] boards and you could watch three other people ask questions and they'll have their opinions
[02:56:18] but just in the observation mode that is of tremendous value just to watch people how they answer
[02:56:27] how they act how they think how they reasoned through a particular scenario how they explain
[02:56:33] their problem solving methodology so so many interviews due to the firefighting and the time and you
[02:56:39] know that this is reactionary they don't put the time into it they don't put people in a room and go
[02:56:43] okay this was my impression of the answer to the question this is how I think they'll work or
[02:56:49] succeed or fail or struggle in this particular environment you can get actually a lot out of
[02:56:55] observation which is why we put this in the book to give an example of what are on those murder
[02:57:00] boards and you probably remember this one is they're they're gonna ask you an ethical question
[02:57:04] you're dealing with a boss who does something highly unethical you know what actions do you take
[02:57:11] and the response is going to tell you a lot about the person yeah yeah and you guys do a great
[02:57:18] job of kind of laying all the stuff out from how to observe them to do a role plays with them
[02:57:23] sent case case studies and scenarios you've got all that stuff in here observation what to look for
[02:57:30] how to look for it different situations you can look for it and I mean it's just it's just a very
[02:57:35] thorough chapter and then you get into assessment tests and you talk about you know the IQ test
[02:57:42] at the army used and just the different assessment tests that get used now so that's all good
[02:57:54] and one of those tests you comment on here one company we work with that yeah
[02:57:57] if Overwatch using aptitude motivation and personality assessment to weed out candidates are
[02:58:02] veterans despite being high performers we're all scoring very low on the test and thus being
[02:58:06] eliminated from the hiring process curious might took the test for himself his score just 57% of
[02:58:13] failing grade so what was up with that test so your assessment test naturally had bias
[02:58:23] built in by whoever designed that test and there was a bias against you know I'm not saying in the
[02:58:28] native light veterans are very different from the demographic that test was based around
[02:58:35] the bottom line we're trying to say here's the assessments are good it's another layer to the
[02:58:39] process that you use to select people especially if you have talent profiles and when you do these
[02:58:43] talent profiles to identify your high performers you also want to do that against your low performers
[02:58:48] to see if the assessment test is actually accurate because if your high performers know performers
[02:58:53] in the same role or generally getting the same results that got a assessment test is most likely
[02:59:00] not relevant or added value to that process is it yeah is it measuring what you want it to measure
[02:59:07] right is it determining the success factors and one of the challenges with companies is that and
[02:59:14] this is just you know kind of that that inside the talent acquisition function and talent management
[02:59:20] function people will buy and enterprise wide solution and apply that test across the board
[02:59:26] and just say okay this test applies to everybody and in my particular case it's screening
[02:59:30] out veterans and we're able to look at that and go every yes something's wrong but it's hard to
[02:59:37] persuade people that you know something they've invested a good amount of money in is not showing
[02:59:43] them what it should show them I mean they're very wedded to their solution they're they're bought
[02:59:48] in and it's hard to move them off the mark but Mike was an exceptional example of where people are
[02:59:54] using something that's not showing success factors that you want it to be showing you it's another
[03:00:01] data point yeah which so we do see companies that use these personality assessments as a
[03:00:07] either no go or go criteria and I would caution people not to do that you talked about not being
[03:00:15] a rules follower funny enough we had a company that recently assessed one of our people and you know
[03:00:21] I won't say what's physical organization this person works for but he's with a very unique
[03:00:27] or organization and he's been in that seat for five years which is an indicator that this guy is
[03:00:32] is a high performing individual ethical absolutely and when he took this test the company came back
[03:00:37] and said this guy's not you know it shows that he doesn't follow rules and we sort of had to
[03:00:42] explain the context of the role he was in and say he finds a way to win and that may be why
[03:00:48] he's not testing well in that one criteria on that assessment so you've got to be cautious even
[03:00:52] like Josh cotton Dr. Cotton that does this for a living what will caution you
[03:00:58] with regards to results on assessments he said you got to take it with a grain of salt
[03:01:02] and some people to use a phrase that that you know I remember hearing it muster actually
[03:01:08] assessment tests are not inoculations they don't insulate you from making a bad hire they don't
[03:01:14] inoculate you from you know all the risk in the world you need to use them as my says they're
[03:01:20] just one more data point but they it all begins and ends with knowing what success looks like
[03:01:26] for a particular role and that requires thought it requires you know planning and and mapping that
[03:01:32] out how you're going to go do it like I said you got that chapter locked in the next chapter
[03:01:40] goes into the fact that you can't hire or fire your way to success talent acquisition is only
[03:01:47] one part of a two variable equation for success talent plus leadership equals victory
[03:01:53] and then there's a story in here about Mike and a little task unit that you were in called task unit
[03:02:00] Charlie and what's interesting about task unit Charlie so task unit bruiser and task unit Charlie
[03:02:06] and task unit alpha we're all at seal team three and every one of those task units had
[03:02:13] some great guys and you know if you put the bell curve on all of them they'd all be
[03:02:18] relatively the same group of you know seals you know couple low guys couple high guys
[03:02:23] bunch of guys in the middle just just kind of typical nothing good or bad just typical
[03:02:28] but it didn't really work out that way from a leadership perspective no it did not so pulled
[03:02:34] from the same talent pull away like you said the talent profile for both the task units was the
[03:02:38] exact same and this is where you know we caution people in the you know this is why we end
[03:02:45] the book with this chapter is you had two groups where the resources the talent everything was
[03:02:51] predominantly the same same budgets same weapon systems same people really and one rise raised to
[03:03:00] the occasion and one fell below the standard in the seal teams and was toxic and the final determination
[03:03:08] was leadership so bad leadership can poison any talent pull of exceptional people it just can't
[03:03:17] and in that I'm so fortunate I got to observe that at a young tenure in my career and what I
[03:03:28] benefited to is you know I got plucked out of that task unit but you're task unit and it talks
[03:03:34] about how I wasn't the root of the problem but the person that was the root of the problem
[03:03:38] I basically threatened because I have an allergic reaction to people that are just selfish
[03:03:44] and all about themselves and this individual wasn't he he wasn't to solely blame but he was the
[03:03:49] impetus of the the problem and so I came I guess with warnings when they sent me over to you and
[03:03:56] then all the sudden I started prosper and I've become your operations officer I was your assistant
[03:04:00] operations officer you put me in charge of operations officer you that was a motive and then you promoted
[03:04:06] me two months later to Delta between a.o.i.c. you know the funny thing is a lot of the guys the
[03:04:11] deployment after that were sestone took basically task unit bruiser back to Iraq we ended up in the
[03:04:18] battle of southern city a majority of the guys in that troop were from task unit Charlie so again
[03:04:25] you put them under a great litter and they did exceptional things so that's why we say you can no longer
[03:04:30] well you know you can't fire or hire fire your way to success ultimately you have to lead and you
[03:04:34] have to develop your people and that's what this chapter is about yeah we we kind of brought it around
[03:04:39] to you know as we mentioned earlier in the book you have to treat your human capital as importantly
[03:04:45] or as important as your financial capital and this was a way to kind of close that out to say
[03:04:52] the journey doesn't end when you hire a players you get this whole process right that's not the
[03:04:57] end of it you're not done and we did this ill video clip and we call it the talent war
[03:05:02] the interesting thing about this title is and and we went into this in the video is that war doesn't end
[03:05:10] it's continuous you're gonna win some battles but there's no point in this even if you read this
[03:05:14] book if you do everything in this book and Mike and I are working with you and everything goes perfectly
[03:05:19] you don't get to declare victory people grow people change products change the environment changes
[03:05:26] people move on you have to keep after this this is a discipline that you need to bring to your company
[03:05:34] and when you do you will have a competitive advantage it's the path it's part of the path
[03:05:41] back to the book far too often a company will hire talented candidate a talented candidate who's
[03:05:46] performance ends up being lackluster the company chalks up to a bad hire fires the person
[03:05:50] starts all over again a costly assumption there are many reasons someone might not be performing as you expect
[03:05:57] and only one of them is a bad hire chances are if a talented individual is not performing to standard
[03:06:02] it's not their fault it's yours a little extreme ownership coming at you live
[03:06:13] public talent work talent development you guys talk about training mentoring and coaching
[03:06:22] good quote and hear from Jonah Pinto from 711 CEO most important thing in any organization is leadership
[03:06:29] it's always leadership first because leaders find a way to get things done
[03:06:34] once again something up a great attitude and and for the listeners to open to is actually a
[03:06:41] west point the military academy graduate he served as a army officer before he entered the
[03:06:46] the corporate world leadership is the most critical determinant of achieving victory for business
[03:06:52] leaders are the ones who drive change makes things happen so when working to transform high
[03:06:56] potential high potentials into high performers it's critical to identify and develop future
[03:07:02] leaders that's just the way it's got to be and then wrapping this up a little bit here
[03:07:13] actually this I'll wrap this up right here with this like it's not quite the closer but it's close
[03:07:19] a true talent mindset like I said this is kind of the underlying thread of the book
[03:07:23] remember the most critical step in winning the war on talent is developing the talent mindset
[03:07:27] the deep belief that human capital is the single most important competitive advantage your company
[03:07:32] can have if you truly believe human capital is your greatest competitive advantage you won't
[03:07:37] stop with a hiring process you will continue to invest in and develop your people creating an
[03:07:42] unbroken chain of excellence that's what good leaders do that's how great organizations are formed
[03:07:49] the training and leadership development opportunities you provide your employees reveal the
[03:07:53] truth of your talent mindset you might be able to attract candidates with a talk of a talent mindset
[03:08:00] but if you want them to stay you need to show your employees that you truly value talent
[03:08:06] by helping them to grow into their potential starts with you if you demonstrate exemplary leadership
[03:08:13] others will follow practice a talent mindset mentoring coach your key leaders put in the time and
[03:08:20] effort to develop your people into something great and a great organization will emerge
[03:08:29] so that's I mean then you you go on you have a good closing but you know that's it it's
[03:08:38] recruiting selecting training mentorship putting the right people in the right places
[03:08:42] think about that's what putting the right people in the right places all those things
[03:08:50] are really one thing and that is leadership and this is how you build a team and leaders have
[03:08:56] to understand the importance of that they have to understand the importance of building the correct team
[03:09:04] so one thing that we're doing you know is obviously helping people build these teams with EFO
[03:09:10] overwatch tell me a little bit about the process at EFO for watch to take and find the right people
[03:09:19] bring them in and get them assigned to the right companies out there these and you know a lot of
[03:09:27] people say hey you guys are veteran recruiting for I sort of actually push back I say no we are
[03:09:31] our leadership talent acquisition firm we we only deal with military leaders and people naturally
[03:09:37] put a rank on that oh senior enlisted or or officers you know it's all levels in the military
[03:09:42] as long as they have the attributes we're looking for especially humility so the military leaders
[03:09:49] come coming out of the military you have already been highly vetted and guess what they have
[03:09:54] rep mutations and it's very easy for us to reach back into those communities and reach into the
[03:10:00] seals and say hey does anyone know this chakra willing guy yeah I want your buds with them
[03:10:05] solid another guy says I did two platoons with them you can not find a more reliable team or
[03:10:10] any any individual and that's what we need to hear we are also putting them through multiple assessments
[03:10:16] Josh's EPI we're going to start utilizing that as a basis for us plus we want to collect data
[03:10:21] to see if we can start identifying the difference between high performers middle performers in
[03:10:27] low performers and he's already started that that process and then really with with the candidate side
[03:10:34] it's so simple it's very easy to identify the ones that are just you've got it and we're really
[03:10:40] looking for the top 10 20% of every community in the military and those that don't fall into that
[03:10:46] realm we still want to help them with training we're dedicated to our brothers and sisters in
[03:10:51] our arms to make sure that they're they're successful we can't place every candidate you know
[03:10:56] we just don't have enough job opportunities one day we will but if one thing for the military
[03:11:00] leaders that come to us they go through some of the best training but they go through the extreme
[03:11:05] ownership and what what we and we talked about this last night the reason I love extreme ownership
[03:11:09] is I've never seen two people you in life create a leadership system that is so simple because
[03:11:15] if you go ask the Air Force army the Navy the Marine Corps they're all they're all going to give
[03:11:19] you different answers on what attributes are important and what are the the primary principles
[03:11:26] of leadership they're all saying the same thing but it's not codified so what extreme ownership and
[03:11:31] even for the candidates reading the book is what we tell them is hey in the interview process you
[03:11:35] have to tell story why we love extreme ownership so much is not only is it going to help you
[03:11:40] contextualize your leadership experience and that's what they need help with some of these leaders
[03:11:45] coming out special operations leaders who have been serving for 20 years leading is muscle memory
[03:11:50] to them now and that's why if you ask them the question tells about your leadership style some
[03:11:54] struggle through it but when we teach them the context of extreme ownership they start to
[03:11:59] get their story and the way you guys wrote the book combat story principle business context
[03:12:05] helps them to translate we all know the number one challenge for veterans trying to get jobs is
[03:12:10] translating their experience extreme ownership sets them on the path to doing that in a good
[03:12:14] manner then I handle that first part of them they get George and Carly Walden and
[03:12:20] they put them through search training they prepare them for the interview process the feedback
[03:12:26] we're getting from senior special operations leaders to other military leaders is this is the
[03:12:31] best advice I've ever gotten from taps and all these other programs that we go through we don't
[03:12:38] sugarcoat anything we give them the reality of the situation and we're very straightforward that
[03:12:44] it's on you we can't step into the interview with you it is on you to convey your value to the
[03:12:49] organization and get them to say yes they want to say yes that's the military leader side
[03:12:56] and talk about rewarding work not only do we do we we we make a you know a good paycheck from from
[03:13:04] this mine of work it's also the emotional return on investment from senior in our former
[03:13:08] brothers and sisters step into senior management positions and then crush it that's feedback we get
[03:13:13] from business leaders best higher I've I've ever made on the the client side we screen our clients
[03:13:22] is diligently as we screen our candidates and this has been a learning process we've had to learn
[03:13:27] this through scars and it comes down to I need the clients to commit and I need to hear that they
[03:13:32] have a foundation of belief that leadership is wildly and infinitely more important than in
[03:13:38] street experience if we hear that from the clients we believe they truly understand that then that's a
[03:13:43] client we're most likely going to work with but if we get a client we've had this like hey listen
[03:13:48] I need a leader right now to step into this role I don't want to have to train them I don't want
[03:13:52] to have to build a relationship with them literally said this I just need them to do their job
[03:13:56] and it was a lucrative role we said hey we're not the best fit because we know that that
[03:14:00] relationship is just going to end poorly so also clients come to us and they say we need to
[03:14:04] fill in 20 days they've already compromised the process and we're not going to do that so we're very
[03:14:09] prideful on the white love service that we provide and if we don't have many misses at all but if we
[03:14:17] find out a candidate it didn't work it is like a get punch it is like our reputation has been
[03:14:24] marked and that we take it very seriously and I think that's what you know sort of
[03:14:29] differentiates us from from a lot of the executive search firms out there is I know we together
[03:14:36] in George we're going to build this into the number one leadership town acquisition firm in the
[03:14:40] nation I have no doubt then when people look for directors of leadership in training as well as
[03:14:45] chief leadership officers they're going to say go to you if overwatch because the men and women
[03:14:49] were placing know how to train people they know how to create the foundation for strong
[03:14:54] cultures and that's really where we're making the name right now we'll still place people in the
[03:14:58] COO roles general management roles but one of my passions for you if overwatch is that that
[03:15:03] director of leadership in training or the COO position yeah you know just to be completely
[03:15:12] transparent to be in talent acquisition you have to have a pretty strong mass acoustic gene
[03:15:16] about you because it's a brutal a brutal job function but I've been helping veterans for over 20
[03:15:23] years and where it started was I want to be able to give to our brothers and sisters and arms of
[03:15:29] things that I didn't have when I transitioned out in the 90s and what they didn't have was
[03:15:33] actionable information and we deal once we go through selection kind of assessment and finding
[03:15:39] that right candidate with all those attributes they're still this bridge between the ideal
[03:15:44] opportunity for that veteran leader for that senior leader and that position it's called the
[03:15:49] interview and that is very very difficult for veterans to cross that divide to be able to articulate
[03:15:55] clearly and then a crisp professional impactful manner in the interview that you're going to be able
[03:16:01] to over deliver in that particular role so it isn't just you know we're doing all facets of it and
[03:16:08] I think that's what makes the dynamic between me and Mike and our team so well so good so solid and so
[03:16:14] different is that you have 20 years of selection and assessment we both been in leadership roles I've
[03:16:20] been in the executive roles and we're bringing actionable information to top military leaders
[03:16:26] so that they are ready for that transition into corporate America and when you put that person
[03:16:32] in that position it gets more veteran hiring and so we have to get it right with the company
[03:16:38] we have to get it right with the veteran and and there's some veterans that we we're not going
[03:16:42] to place but we're absolutely agnostic if they come to us we're going to help but crossing that bridge
[03:16:50] screening our our candidates screening our clients we are very meticulous about how we go about
[03:16:55] doing that yeah I think talking to some of the clients of people that we've placed and just
[03:17:03] awesome to hear everything that you guys are talking about it's like it's like with extreme
[03:17:08] ownership we go and work with the company and we check back in with them three months later and
[03:17:11] they're like oh yeah this is working this is awesome and it's the same thing we're getting back
[03:17:15] you know when I hear from clients you know this is the best hire we've had oh yeah we we were worried
[03:17:21] and now we're promoting I think it's just like a totally it as we often say it works this stuff works
[03:17:29] and you take these individuals and I know Mike you and I've been talking about this and I know it's a
[03:17:34] little bit hard to do but we're some of the guys that we've placed we're going to get them on the podcast
[03:17:39] so they can talk about not just their military experience but then what it was like going through
[03:17:44] we if Overwatch and now what it's like entering this civilian world you know we're letting them get
[03:17:47] settled in a little bit before we get them back to fly out to California and do this but I think
[03:17:53] it'll be awesome for people to start to hear those stories and get that feedback
[03:18:00] when people want to engage you if Overwatch towards the process so they can go to the website
[03:18:06] efoverwatch.com another thing we we do with companies is we are here as a talent advisory
[03:18:11] we can come in and basically set the foundation based off the playbook we've provided so you have
[03:18:18] a hiring process from which to grow and that's probably the greatest service we can provide
[03:18:24] beyond just finding the right leaders for your organization that's critical there's a lot of
[03:18:29] times a George will actually have to ask the client do you have interview questions what
[03:18:33] your process can I send you something to help you make the selection of the leaders we present
[03:18:38] and that's more often than that that talent advisory piece is is key but but if I'm just
[03:18:47] company out there that wants to hire so I go to efoverwatch.com I fill out the various information
[03:18:55] and then we're going to set up a call and you're going to talk with Mike he'll talk to
[03:18:59] myself you may talk with one other person and we're going to really kind of dig in with you as to
[03:19:06] okay let's talk about your company what is your position in the market what are you trying to
[03:19:10] accomplish where are you trying to grow what are your leadership gaps what are your individual
[03:19:14] contributor gaps you know we want to know both of those things you know what are those things that
[03:19:19] are keeping you up at night and then let's talk about how talent and leadership solves those problems
[03:19:25] and are you committed to leadership is the most important thing in your business and you know we'll
[03:19:30] also walk through to find out the maturity of their hiring process and how they've done it because
[03:19:35] you know we we want to make sure that they know how to do because they're mechanics behind this
[03:19:39] as well we've helped with offer letters I've helped with compensation you know structuring complex
[03:19:44] offers which which is not easy for small and medium business to do a lot of times they just don't
[03:19:48] have that expertise so we will sit down and spend a good hour hour and a half with them you know
[03:19:54] diagnosing you know why did they come to us what is it that they need what can we solve for them
[03:20:00] and should we be working together and I'm sorry miss I'm sorry so the the question jocca
[03:20:04] absolutely it's going to be a series of phone calls we want to know everything about your business
[03:20:08] about your industry and a lot of times the reason we do these phone calls because what business
[03:20:12] the leaders think they want is not necessarily what they need and our our job as well during
[03:20:17] that is to advise them based off what we're hearing what we think you really need is x, y, z,
[03:20:22] not a, b, c and our clients have followed our advice and it's worked out beautifully
[03:20:27] what you know we're in that advice is coming from nothing but scars and failures especially
[03:20:31] with 20 years of talent acquisition between him and uh currently so we we want a very very strong
[03:20:38] relationship with our clients if they sign the contract beyond that then it gets into the talent
[03:20:43] sink for what what what a talent sink is for us is we're going to spec out what that position is
[03:20:49] and what are the attributes they're truly looking for from there we we tell him hey we're going to
[03:20:55] need usually two to three weeks to start screaming and assessing potential leaders the the people
[03:21:01] the the right leaders for this position it could be through our organic town pool we're also
[03:21:06] going to run an external search for people we haven't touched yet that maybe out there that may be a
[03:21:11] good fit for that role and that takes time and our clients again we're preaching patience
[03:21:17] we have a pretty darn good fill speed rate to fill and if people allow us to go through our process
[03:21:27] it usually very statistically it works out and they're very good pairing yeah well it's
[03:21:32] like what we do methodical and you know we saw say all the time at S. L. Front what we do is we
[03:21:37] solve problems through leadership and what better way to solve a problem through leadership than to
[03:21:43] actually give a person give a give a company a leader that understands these principles that knows
[03:21:48] how to lead that knows how to step in and make things happen so that's been awesome you have
[03:21:53] over watch dot com I can't we've been going for almost three and a half hours but I real quick
[03:22:00] you have battlefield we just kind of ran our first pilot program and to tell us about that a little bit
[03:22:06] so this besides let me interject that was freaking awesome you weren't a believer first is that
[03:22:13] accurate or that's completely inaccurate I don't know where where why do you think that we
[03:22:18] late when I thought we're like oh juckers not necessarily believe we're he has to see the concept
[03:22:21] personally I 100% of a believer that was a thousand percent I mean you know if you think about what
[03:22:28] I do in this podcast I take I take battlefield strolls through books so for me to go out and walk
[03:22:35] battlefields is to me I would do nothing but that that would be my whole life if I was telling
[03:22:41] you I I got offered a show in Europe to like go and walk battlefields and talk the stories and I just
[03:22:48] couldn't do it it was multiple months of filming and I just it's not happening you know I just can't do it
[03:22:55] but at some point in my life I wouldn't be surprised so yeah I don't know where that idea came from
[03:23:02] that is a data-centric lack of relationship with no-one or boss yeah it's actually kind of crazy to think that
[03:23:08] me that me even with my whole life would not want to go out and walk on bat sacred hollowed
[03:23:17] battlefields and talk about leadership that's yeah so I'm 100% on board and I always have been from
[03:23:23] day one so so where this came from is in 2012 no yeah 2012 with one of my seal squadrons
[03:23:31] the commanding officer especially the timing was not good we were one month away from going to
[03:23:35] Afghanistan and and I'm the operations officer and of course you know the task list of what you
[03:23:41] need to get done before you deploy is pretty deep as an operations officer and I I sort of tried
[03:23:46] to reason with him I hate timing is not good any heard me out and he said my guess what what we're
[03:23:51] going out there leadership development is not optional it's mandatory and so we went out to
[03:23:56] get his bird and of course I'm pouty you know I'm doing my quiet sort of pouty I'm there and as we
[03:24:02] started to walk the different stands the two day walk of get his bird you started to realize that
[03:24:08] the commanders both Confederate Union forces faced the same dilemmas same human dilemmas and
[03:24:14] human problems that we faced in Afghanistan I rack another regions of the world what makes and we
[03:24:19] call this in the military we call these staff rights it is a technique we utilize to develop our
[03:24:24] people again looking at past examples of commanders humans that made both great decisions and bad
[03:24:31] decisions in learning from their mistakes and their successes to make you a better leader
[03:24:37] when you walk and people may say well you know the civil wars drastically different than I
[03:24:41] rack or Afghanistan technology no the problems they face transcend geography they transcend technology
[03:24:50] they transcend time and this is why a lot of businesses do these staff rights we call it you
[03:24:55] have battlefield but what I think we do better than any just sort of history and that takes people out there
[03:25:01] is we tie extreme ownership into it and on this first one the pilot we brought 20 of our clients out
[03:25:06] and I don't know about you I mean they probably don't call you because they don't have your phone number
[03:25:10] but I've been getting text messages from CE the CEOs that route there that this was one of the
[03:25:15] most valuable leadership development trips they've ever taken or you could see it on their face
[03:25:20] this is in the first hour you could see it on their faces they're looking they're taking notes they're
[03:25:24] talking to each other yeah it was just extremely impactful and you know it was a pilot and we're
[03:25:32] going to start spinning those things up yeah if you will keep you posted we'll keep you posted
[03:25:38] and I mean there's going to be limited seats I mean that's just the way it is it's going to be
[03:25:42] small groups but who knows it's freaking it's just an unbelievable way to learn and an unbelievable
[03:25:49] way to develop and an unbelievable way to increase your understanding not just of history not just
[03:25:57] of leadership but of human nature to go out there and see what has happened in our past so it's
[03:26:04] freaking awesome a lot of stuff going on man we do so the book comes out when November 10th so it's
[03:26:13] up on Amazon right now the town or it's right now we just have the ebook the Kindle version the
[03:26:20] paperback will be up momentarily it's in the Amazon right now then the hardback will follow that
[03:26:26] naughty a book ultimately though the book launches November 10th which if I need to educate you
[03:26:31] you know November 10th is you don't need that to give me a bro the Marine Corp birthday no coincidence
[03:26:37] George any any closing comments here you know this is it's been an interesting journey to
[03:26:45] write this book and it's it's it's very serendipitous to find somebody who has the same passion
[03:26:51] for talent that I have and and so you know I hope that Mike and I got the best out of each other in this
[03:26:58] book push each other and really proud of what we've delivered here because ultimately it's about
[03:27:07] helping companies just get better and win and and and I'd like to think we did a pretty good job of
[03:27:13] of giving them a good roadmap the talent is the most critical thing that you can focus on
[03:27:21] any closing thoughts Mike no check we're trying to get better we're trying to build a better team
[03:27:29] echo Charles this any recommendations on how we can get better interesting thing about
[03:27:35] what we've been talking about is like yeah you guys talk about you know these are things
[03:27:43] to to look for you know and as far as hiring and stuff but on the other side of the coin like if
[03:27:48] you're looking at get hired hired it's like a good information resource to be like okay that's
[03:27:54] what I'm gonna strive for you know very interesting anyway it's for striving for stuff
[03:28:01] stop about Jaco feel for striving really transition well yeah so Jaco feel how should I say
[03:28:12] assortment supplementation items the ones that stay on my mind which I noticed like I don't
[03:28:20] so much think that much about milk really yeah that's interesting you must be not not wanting to
[03:28:27] bit be stronger well here's the things not that I don't take milk all the time I don't think about
[03:28:33] it all the time but I do think about joint warfare krill oil and vitamin D for some reason I
[03:28:39] don't know why I feel like because it's like an everyday maintenance thing and when I stop
[03:28:44] taking it that's when I pay the price harsh here's my question to you yes do you know what that
[03:28:50] price is like have you felt it because you don't really go after it or I don't I don't go off
[03:28:56] it yeah so I don't know the price yeah I do yeah so basically like you know like okay all right
[03:29:04] let me turn my attention over here so you know like sometimes like you okay maybe you're feeling
[03:29:08] weak or whatever right but as far as your joint skill you can feel strong but your joints are like
[03:29:15] jammed up that's almost in a way worse than being weak because if you're weak you're like oh
[03:29:20] maybe any eat good maybe whatever but if you're joint it's like it's a it's a different issue
[03:29:24] seems saying is a good news get back on the joint warfare get back on the krill oil you just
[03:29:31] feel all that stuff just flying back into your joints then you're back in the game then we start
[03:29:36] feeling good about it real good by the way so and I know this too because I have gone off it
[03:29:42] and gotten on few times and yeah so I know the price and I know the benefit do you are you able
[03:29:48] to make these assessments because you're a doctor no okay well my my explanation of the joint
[03:29:57] warfare in krill oil flying back into your joints was we'll say a little bit short of a medical
[03:30:03] explanation as far as how I'm not a doctor either yes I know that but I've done also of a very
[03:30:11] intense medical assessment of of vitamin B3 and cold war and here's the assessment
[03:30:20] I've traveled all over the place I've shaken hands with a bunch of people I have not had this
[03:30:26] disease called COVID for some reason could that reason be right okay that reason be
[03:30:34] because I'm on the D3 and the cold war no I'm not saying it is because I'm not a doctor
[03:30:40] no but you know you know there's there is such thing as coincidence then there's such thing as
[03:30:46] correlation and then there's such thing as causation you seem saying the three levels
[03:30:52] hey that's it we'll leave it at that how about that cool safe right yeah just saying we're talking
[03:30:58] earlier about you can only ask certain questions in the interview or not so much you can only ask
[03:31:03] you can't ask certain questions that's very correct actually to deviate from the the
[03:31:09] Jockel field thing for a second isn't it a lot of the times the case where the interviewer
[03:31:15] is kind of in a way like wanting to bond with a person just on a maybe on just a small level like
[03:31:21] hey oh wins the baby do yeah and it's like oh I jam that up like I really like you know it's like it's
[03:31:27] not like they're trying to like enforce powers something like this no I mean the best
[03:31:32] interviewers are always trying to build a relationship because one of the critical things you
[03:31:36] want to get out of people is authenticity yeah that's one of the biggest things and the best
[03:31:39] way you do that is by building a relationship and to your point that person may come in they may
[03:31:44] not come into your company so yeah they do and most of those things are done with malice they
[03:31:50] have an accidentally but you know in today's litigious society even accidental scary that will get
[03:31:57] yeah and see that's why it's so like yeah like scary for real scary because it's like man
[03:32:02] it's one thing to be like hey that was a dick move for me to do that so I'm not going to do that
[03:32:08] anymore you know well how about I just not be a dick in the interview oh problem solved right
[03:32:12] here's the thing problem's not solved because you're getting sued yeah because I can be well in that
[03:32:17] case yes but as far as from a learning perspective or from just a general functioning perspective
[03:32:22] now I'm be like how about that so I'm gonna be real nice how about that I'm gonna bond with this guy
[03:32:25] mean what you're like you know lying what you call minefield landline field one of those
[03:32:29] you're walking on eggshells and whatnot yeah which kind of isn't a very good bonding approach yeah
[03:32:34] you're walking on eggshells yeah then you you kind of get you know your seaming personal your
[03:32:39] risk of vests you know so you know as we teach veterans any good interview is simply a
[03:32:46] conversation it's ultimately what it comes down to and you know when we work with veterans it's just
[03:32:52] hey man be yourself be authentic you know but put it in a vernacular of extreme ownership and talk
[03:32:58] about how great of a leader you are just have a conversation and that's it's simple not easy
[03:33:04] and I love that phrase late later to laws are not always a good thing not all of them are great
[03:33:10] and that's a profession in itself yeah yeah it's just part of my profession is you know that
[03:33:16] training you know ultimately training keeps people safe right that's what it does yeah that's one of
[03:33:21] those situations where you can be mad about it you might not like a particular law but it's
[03:33:24] the law and you got to you got to just deal with it that's just the way it is so you never know
[03:33:30] people could be made it can claims like medical claims about things about supplements and you could
[03:33:35] run into all kinds of legal problems you which he just did there but hey if you're waging war on
[03:33:41] colds various sickness illnesses viruses etc you don't know to name any is there a metal
[03:33:49] quote is that a medical claim real easy maybe not unless these are the things that you do want
[03:33:55] to follow so what's that called like a caveat or no it's not a caveat is it caveat yeah like
[03:34:01] a dislike yeah just here's my disclaimer I'm not a doctor yeah so don't listen to me yes
[03:34:12] well or just listen you know yeah how about this listen to joc what about that okay we'll go with it
[03:34:18] we'll stick with that the mind that I'm not a doctor yeah Johnny Kim doctor
[03:34:23] joc go on no doctor keep these all these things in mind no last yeah vitamin vitamin D daily
[03:34:30] daily man these are things that you know again to stay on your mind I'm not saying don't keep
[03:34:35] milk on your mind I'm not saying that I'm saying me personally in my experience D3 joint warfare
[03:34:44] or not whatever these are the things that okay we have these two-pronged effect let me move my
[03:34:51] attention over here to my pros so you have long term you have short term right and every once
[03:34:55] a while you'll get a golden nugget that's both that's what milk is seem saying a lot of these
[03:35:00] health foods they don't have the immediate gratification as heavy as a lot of these unhealthy
[03:35:06] things I see them saying I do sure milk is one of those rare golden nuggets the other one is
[03:35:11] sushi my opinion but back to milk it's dessert in the form of health food or protein health food
[03:35:19] in the form of a dessert boom either way you're good there you go either way it's true also discipline
[03:35:25] multiple forms multiple forms there's your intrinsic discipline that you go through life with that
[03:35:31] comes from within you know they're not talking about that one right I'm talking about this
[03:35:35] implementation so yes okay what is it what is the three forms you got the powder that's a good one
[03:35:42] that's a good pre workout one I like this first pre workout like I dig a like a pre life
[03:35:48] yeah by the way it was so hot this weekend out here with you have your intensive soap I know
[03:35:52] it's hot there but I mixed up the jockel pomer in the big iced tea like pitcher with ice in it
[03:36:01] cooked those are you out yeah you go feel
[03:36:10] also the the cans okay here's what the cans are really really
[03:36:15] it's a health brain health drink right so it doesn't sound glamorous right think of it it's a
[03:36:26] brain and body health drink okay in the form of a delicious refreshing beverage
[03:36:36] beverage you want to say different times I was gonna say energy drink but then then you got all the
[03:36:40] what you call the what you call it when you have a reputation a word has a reputation
[03:36:43] a freaking stigma has a stigma you seem saying anyway that's what it is so the can is also
[03:36:50] this window okay look we don't want to drink the can we don't want to mix up powders okay I get it
[03:36:54] pop up pill that even has a stigma nonetheless this one's a good way of popping good pills capsules
[03:37:01] technically you know all these forms depending on your lifestyle depending on what you're doing
[03:37:06] that day they can you know at least one's gonna work for you I think my experience that's how it is
[03:37:11] also we got work your kid milk we got chocolate tea and all the stuff is available at the
[03:37:15] vitamin shop we also got if you're gonna get into jjitsu which you might you probably should
[03:37:21] good origin main dot com get yourself a geek get yourself a rash card get yourself things that you
[03:37:29] you can wear when you're not on the jjitsu math's of justice because despite our best efforts
[03:37:34] we're not always training jjitsu sometimes you have to have other parts of your life that's why

[03:38:05] I'm not even saying I'm doing it I'm just saying the store is that becoming more and more developed

[03:38:17] all right we'll go anyway jocco store dot com go there if you appreciate the developments
[03:38:24] if you appreciate beautiful web design yeah exactly yeah if you go check out web design
[03:38:30] web design yeah well actually technically I didn't really design it you know I got a finger in the pot
[03:38:35] nonetheless as far as these angles nonetheless we supply provide really clothing item that you can
[03:38:44] wear to represent while you're on this path that we're on this path that's not easy by the way I don't
[03:38:50] know if you guys know this or not my can George it's hard it's full of pitfalls temptation traps
[03:38:58] wise men once told me that unless when you're on the path you want to represent jocco store dot
[03:39:02] com and that hoodies shirts hats beanie's shorts board shorts
[03:39:10] at some point the shirts are these week the here's the thing they're not up okay
[03:39:15] but they will prove that they're quite hard and they're not the best it's a process you know
[03:39:19] well what it would it would it would it would make say Mike said something the methodology it's a process
[03:39:24] of all the process trust the process is one of our things anyway quite that okay
[03:39:31] quick to create that into the whole deal and boom you got it anyway yes joccal store the three
[03:39:36] if you want something also we got a podcast record subscribe to this podcast because
[03:39:43] echo thinks that you're not going to we also have joccal unraveling which has been on this
[03:39:49] feed it's going to soon be on its own feed joccal unraveling podcasts it's myself a darelecoop
[03:39:54] but that was the thread we had to change the name because I was getting sued again which is always
[03:40:00] fun so that's why it's called joccal unraveling because I own my own name jocco so I can pretty
[03:40:05] much put that on anything and no one can bother me about it grounded podcast we haven't done
[03:40:10] the while maybe record one more this week we have an opportunity warrior kid podcasts as well
[03:40:14] for those little kids out there and if you got little kids or even if you're a grown human
[03:40:18] and I need some soap go to irishokranch.com where young aiden the warrior kid is making soap
[03:40:25] there's a no one out one or the warrior kids still you made warrior kid so like actual
[03:40:31] so not just you as an adult but also your children you too we have a youtube channel
[03:40:41] where echo makes videos and if it's a form in a video he puts a bunch of explosions in it
[03:40:47] and if it's a for our video then it's just nothing because that's the way he operates
[03:40:51] different purposes videos yeah it's cool all right okay we're we're talking about
[03:40:58] effective hiring processes leadership right Mike Shirley George should we put explosions
[03:41:08] smoke and fire in this video occasionally in this in this video that we do that we're doing
[03:41:15] right so it's making at some point when you're talking about something it would it not be
[03:41:21] a good thing to have maybe a black off helicopter fly overhead or a minigun open up
[03:41:29] or an explosion happened in the background echo I'm gonna back you up on this you know you
[03:41:34] ask anyone on the ear for watch team and say what don't I do they say we don't do cute so
[03:41:40] I'm not talking cute bro I'm talking minigun I'd be over the top I think you're hitting
[03:41:45] down the right I think you're right but here's the thing and this is for real if I'm like hey
[03:41:51] if I get moved inspired and I got my notes here I don't have my note here also you're you're
[03:41:58] starting to take it under consideration no I'm saying I'm explaining I have my notes here
[03:42:03] and maybe I was moved by something George or Mike said right I have my note to be like okay look
[03:42:08] if I could isolate what they said and try my best to capture the feeling that I got when you said
[03:42:13] it maybe put my can cut that up into a little video that might involve explosions the
[03:42:19] effects me too much like a certain financial uh tv host mad money oh yeah this is get
[03:42:28] a lot of the money yeah yeah yeah good good comparison I think it's my opinion anyway yes
[03:42:39] some videos have explosions a shorter ones whatever and the video version of this podcast
[03:42:44] but we're keeping it wrong I don't even add color and you want me to add a mini gun opening
[03:42:50] up I don't know probably not I don't know though I could be wrong anyway also psychological
[03:42:56] warfare if you didn't know what that is that's an album that joker recorded with tracks each track
[03:43:02] has a purpose and it gets you past these moments a weakness on this path that we're on in the
