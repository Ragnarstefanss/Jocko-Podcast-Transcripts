00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.44
This is Jocko podcast number 364 with Dave Burke and me Jocko willing good evening Dave. Good evening

2
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:14.42
The misdeeds who volunteered were among the most talented hard-working courageous group of men I have ever encountered

3
00:00:15.20 --> 00:00:17.78
To a man. They were remarkable pilots

4
00:00:18.52 --> 00:00:22.60
They worked long hours days on end to get the program started

5
00:00:23.52 --> 00:00:27.28
During the early missions. We were consumed with establishing procedures

6
00:00:27.28 --> 00:00:34.60
Deciding on tactics constructing our maps testing varied equipment and aircraft configurations and learning the area

7
00:00:35.40 --> 00:00:39.12
It was really hunt and peck trial by fire

8
00:00:40.20 --> 00:00:45.60
We decided on three cycle missions using two in-flight refuelings

9
00:00:46.24 --> 00:00:53.72
We were looking for road traffic storage areas and SAMs, which were beginning to move into the lower parts of the pack

10
00:00:53.72 --> 00:01:01.52
Those early misty missions were really hairy as we experimented with how to survive in a dense triple-a

11
00:01:02.16 --> 00:01:04.80
environment while marking targets and directing strikes

12
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:11.80
Though facking was not a new concept the US Air Force had employed fax since World War two

13
00:01:12.40 --> 00:01:17.24
fast facking was new and we were truly plowing new ground

14
00:01:17.24 --> 00:01:25.20
We had to learn to operate and survive in a very dense threat environment while operating for extended periods at low altitude

15
00:01:26.12 --> 00:01:28.12
dicey stuff

16
00:01:28.36 --> 00:01:37.48
Our loss rate during the first six months was 42% a steep expensive and tragic learning curve. I

17
00:01:38.80 --> 00:01:43.28
Cannot emphasize too strongly the courage of the first group of men who raised their hands

18
00:01:43.28 --> 00:01:51.56
They were going where no jet pilot had ever been before to do dangerous things. No one had ever done

19
00:01:55.24 --> 00:01:59.20
And that right there is an excerpt from a book book called

20
00:02:00.48 --> 00:02:09.000
Misty which is the book is made up of a bunch of first-person accounts of misty pilots in Vietnam and

21
00:02:09.52 --> 00:02:11.52
that particular account

22
00:02:11.52 --> 00:02:20.04
Was from a man named bud day who was the founder and the first commanding officer of the misty squadron

23
00:02:21.52 --> 00:02:28.000
Which he commanded for about two months before he was shot down. He was captured by the communists

24
00:02:28.92 --> 00:02:33.44
He actually escaped his initial captivity, but he was shot and recaptured

25
00:02:33.44 --> 00:02:37.12
And then he was sent to the Hunnoy Hilton where he spent

26
00:02:37.12 --> 00:02:40.68
Five years and seven months as a POW

27
00:02:42.40 --> 00:02:44.40
Upon his release he was awarded the Medal of Honor

28
00:02:45.12 --> 00:02:52.16
For his personal bravery and his leadership in the face of extreme enemy pressure

29
00:02:54.64 --> 00:02:56.64
But even while he was in captivity

30
00:02:57.08 --> 00:03:01.24
The rest of the squadron the misty pilots they continued on

31
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:04.04
they flew the

32
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:08.56
F-100 Super Sabre which is known as the Hunn

33
00:03:10.44 --> 00:03:18.72
There were 157 pilots that served as misty fast facts and facts stands for a forward air controller

34
00:03:19.08 --> 00:03:22.12
They were around from 1967 to 1970

35
00:03:23.12 --> 00:03:27.92
And as forward air controllers that meant they did that from the sky

36
00:03:27.92 --> 00:03:34.60
They were marking targets and directing other aircraft to take out those targets, and it was a very dangerous job

37
00:03:35.56 --> 00:03:36.88
especially because

38
00:03:36.88 --> 00:03:45.52
The misty pilots did a bulk of their flying in North Vietnam where they were exposed to the most intense of the enemy air defenses

39
00:03:46.24 --> 00:03:48.24
and of those

40
00:03:48.72 --> 00:03:50.72
157 pilots

41
00:03:51.44 --> 00:03:54.24
34 were shot down two were shot down twice

42
00:03:54.24 --> 00:03:57.24
23 were recovered

43
00:03:58.32 --> 00:04:00.32
Four were captured by the enemy

44
00:04:01.44 --> 00:04:03.12
seven

45
00:04:03.12 --> 00:04:05.12
were killed in action

46
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:07.72
But

47
00:04:07.72 --> 00:04:12.28
They were able to accomplish their mission. They were able to get bombs on target destroy

48
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
critical enemy nodes and

49
00:04:15.28 --> 00:04:17.52
Deliver a close air support to troops on the ground

50
00:04:18.32 --> 00:04:21.44
And it's an honor to have one of those pilots

51
00:04:21.44 --> 00:04:28.20
With us here tonight to discuss his experiences and his lessons learned his name is dick routine

52
00:04:29.24 --> 00:04:31.24
He served 20 years in the Air Force

53
00:04:31.88 --> 00:04:33.88
and in addition to his

54
00:04:34.52 --> 00:04:38.40
Combat experience he was a test pilot a record setting pilot

55
00:04:38.60 --> 00:04:45.04
He piloted the first plane around the world with no stopping and no refueling. He's also an author

56
00:04:46.44 --> 00:04:49.52
He wrote a book called Voyager and another book

57
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:51.20
called

58
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:53.20
The next five minutes

59
00:04:53.76 --> 00:04:59.64
And it's an honor like I said to have him here tonight dick routine dick. Thank you so much for joining us

60
00:04:59.92 --> 00:05:03.64
Well, it's great to be here. I'm a great fan. It's uh

61
00:05:05.20 --> 00:05:09.08
Man when you think about this new mission that you guys picked up and

62
00:05:09.72 --> 00:05:11.72
What it's like to learn

63
00:05:12.08 --> 00:05:18.16
When you're learning curve is you're learning in combat. That's a that's a rough thing to get into

64
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:20.16
a

65
00:05:21.04 --> 00:05:23.04
Rough way to try and figure things out

66
00:05:24.40 --> 00:05:30.28
Well trial by fire. That's why it's called the initially it was called the Voyager or them

67
00:05:31.96 --> 00:05:34.72
The Misty experience the the Misty

68
00:05:36.28 --> 00:05:38.80
Experiment there we go. Anyway, there's a

69
00:05:40.32 --> 00:05:46.000
There's a thing on PPS. It's very popular now about that that was made up. So about the Misty pilots

70
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Well, it's called Misty the Misty

71
00:05:48.60 --> 00:05:50.60
the Misty experiment

72
00:05:51.04 --> 00:05:53.04
Okay, and PBS. Oh

73
00:05:53.64 --> 00:05:57.08
Well, I haven't seen that one yet, but I'll definitely check that one out because it's

74
00:05:58.12 --> 00:06:01.64
Anytime you're exploring new ground like that and you're doing in a combat situation

75
00:06:01.76 --> 00:06:05.96
That's just that's a scary thing to do and you guys were definitely doing it

76
00:06:07.92 --> 00:06:09.52
So let's before we get into that

77
00:06:09.52 --> 00:06:14.64
Let's let's start at the beginning and about kind of where you came from in the beginning and I'm gonna go to your

78
00:06:14.64 --> 00:06:17.84
So your book you've written two books. This one's called the next five minutes

79
00:06:18.92 --> 00:06:20.92
embracing the impossible and

80
00:06:21.84 --> 00:06:29.96
You say in this book my father Dr. George a routine always said he had an inkling that my life would involve adventure

81
00:06:29.96 --> 00:06:34.36
Even as a baby in diapers. I was exploring our farm in rural Oregon. I

82
00:06:34.96 --> 00:06:37.52
Wanted to see and touch and explore at all looking back

83
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:42.84
I realized that our parents gave their children a precious gift of freedom to explore the world and experience life

84
00:06:42.84 --> 00:06:45.44
They never held us back from doing anything even if

85
00:06:46.28 --> 00:06:48.28
Some thought it risky or dangerous

86
00:06:48.84 --> 00:06:54.48
My dad lovingly called pop was a product of the Great Depression and a World War two Navy veteran

87
00:06:55.16 --> 00:07:02.20
He took advantage of his VA benefits and put himself through dental school then moved his family to Danuba

88
00:07:02.20 --> 00:07:07.46
Am I saying that right? That's right. I knew that Dianuba a small agricultural heartland town

89
00:07:07.46 --> 00:07:13.46
35 miles southeast of Fresno, California. It was the perfect place to grow up to fly

90
00:07:13.62 --> 00:07:21.46
Cessnas and Piper Cubs to ride motorcycles and to throw toilet paper out of an airplane over the high school during a Friday night football game

91
00:07:21.98 --> 00:07:26.34
While riding my BSA motorcycle. I was often chased out of town by local cops

92
00:07:26.86 --> 00:07:30.94
But usually found a way to ditch them by riding through neighborhood vineyards. I

93
00:07:31.58 --> 00:07:33.90
Knew they couldn't catch me although many tried

94
00:07:33.90 --> 00:07:37.58
I enjoyed the thrill of this count mask count cat mouse game

95
00:07:38.02 --> 00:07:44.14
Even when the officers would caution my parents about my unrulyness. So there's a little glimpse into your

96
00:07:44.70 --> 00:07:51.54
Into your childhood sounds like you were a handful now. It's great. Dianuba was an absolute fantastic place to grow up

97
00:07:51.90 --> 00:07:54.42
at the freedom lot of agriculture and

98
00:07:56.42 --> 00:07:58.42
That's when we learn how to fly

99
00:07:58.86 --> 00:08:01.02
little airplanes and would be

100
00:08:01.02 --> 00:08:04.000
Buzzing and throwing toilet paper out like they said

101
00:08:04.66 --> 00:08:06.70
So what what did your dad do in the Navy?

102
00:08:07.74 --> 00:08:10.58
dad got in at the at the very end of

103
00:08:11.22 --> 00:08:15.26
the of the of the war in fact

104
00:08:16.14 --> 00:08:22.30
He should have been exempt and he called up and there was a mistake someplace and they

105
00:08:23.50 --> 00:08:28.90
They gave me draft notice. He says hey, I'm married and I have a family and I should be exempt and they thought

106
00:08:28.90 --> 00:08:30.90
Well, yeah, you're right

107
00:08:31.18 --> 00:08:36.62
But he says you know something my country's at war. God damn it. I'm gonna go and he did

108
00:08:37.14 --> 00:08:39.14
And so what he do in the Navy?

109
00:08:39.38 --> 00:08:43.30
he was I think he was a corpsman there and

110
00:08:43.86 --> 00:08:45.86
Farragut

111
00:08:46.26 --> 00:08:49.38
Fact that's up where we live right now in Cordelaine, Idaho

112
00:08:50.42 --> 00:08:53.98
by Lake Ponduray and this big huge naval base up there and

113
00:08:53.98 --> 00:08:59.94
That's where he spent the end of the war. He never made it into

114
00:09:00.82 --> 00:09:02.82
Into a ship or into combat or anything

115
00:09:03.82 --> 00:09:09.34
And then he then he uses GI bill to pay for dental school and became a dentist

116
00:09:09.34 --> 00:09:16.74
That's right like many of those vets they took advantage of that and I think it was a probably one of the best investments our country ever made

117
00:09:17.58 --> 00:09:20.90
Yeah, and then you know you met you've already talked to me

118
00:09:20.90 --> 00:09:24.78
We were like two paragraphs into the beginning of the book and you're already talking about flying Cessnas

119
00:09:24.78 --> 00:09:27.58
What was your first experience in a plane?

120
00:09:28.78 --> 00:09:30.78
well

121
00:09:33.10 --> 00:09:38.18
It was right after World War two it's just a little kid I can't remember exactly what it was but my mother

122
00:09:38.94 --> 00:09:43.78
When dad was going through dental school. We didn't have any money and for some reason mom

123
00:09:43.78 --> 00:09:49.82
Took me out to a place called Flea Bob there in Riverside. It's a little grass field and

124
00:09:50.82 --> 00:09:52.18
she

125
00:09:52.18 --> 00:09:54.78
bought an airplane ride for this little kid and

126
00:09:55.62 --> 00:10:00.02
To this day I can remember almost every detail of that experience

127
00:10:00.82 --> 00:10:04.62
We went out there and we're gonna fly and that was pretty neat thing

128
00:10:04.62 --> 00:10:08.94
but then at that time that airport was just a grass field someplace and

129
00:10:08.94 --> 00:10:12.70
It was in a pipe and it's a J5

130
00:10:13.02 --> 00:10:17.66
Piper cub and the back seat was a little wider and then that means that two people could sit there

131
00:10:18.14 --> 00:10:21.98
Okay, well they put mom and I in the back and when I sat out I couldn't see out

132
00:10:21.98 --> 00:10:25.76
You know the windows are too high and I said there's no fine way

133
00:10:26.30 --> 00:10:28.86
That I'm gonna sit in this hole in this experience

134
00:10:29.02 --> 00:10:32.46
so I stood up and and grabbed onto the pilot seat and

135
00:10:33.22 --> 00:10:36.98
It was an old airplane and and I can still remember

136
00:10:36.98 --> 00:10:38.22
the

137
00:10:38.22 --> 00:10:41.02
Stuffing and I can still remember what it smelled like and

138
00:10:42.26 --> 00:10:45.06
I remember that the tires had no tread and

139
00:10:46.38 --> 00:10:49.66
Somebody came out and hand-prop the airplane and got it going

140
00:10:51.26 --> 00:10:53.66
And we accelerated in the big thrill

141
00:10:54.90 --> 00:11:00.94
Lifting off and seeing an entire new world that I had never experienced even existed and

142
00:11:00.94 --> 00:11:07.38
And for that 15 minutes that we flew over Riverside and I still remember the the famous mission in and

143
00:11:08.74 --> 00:11:14.62
Had no idea that later on that I was going to be honored with a set of wings in the flyers wall

144
00:11:15.18 --> 00:11:17.74
but anyway, I looked down and it was so amazing and

145
00:11:19.82 --> 00:11:22.94
And it would what I saw that day would change my life forever

146
00:11:24.42 --> 00:11:27.34
Mom would say her two sons

147
00:11:27.34 --> 00:11:36.02
Had aviation fuel instead of blood and they were not issued birth certificates. They were issued

148
00:11:37.42 --> 00:11:44.38
Fly plants and so it from that moment on it was in an extreme

149
00:11:44.38 --> 00:11:46.38
I guess abnormal

150
00:11:46.38 --> 00:11:48.38
fascination for aviation and

151
00:11:48.94 --> 00:11:55.86
Unfortunately, maybe at the expense of a more rounded character development. I knew a lot about airplanes

152
00:11:55.86 --> 00:11:58.10
everything

153
00:11:58.10 --> 00:12:04.54
As they flew over you could identify which one they were and I knew what kind of motor engines they had and so forth

154
00:12:05.10 --> 00:12:12.22
But the other things to make a rounded experience for growing up. I knew absolutely jack squat about anything

155
00:12:14.30 --> 00:12:20.82
So as you're growing up so you definitely want to be a pilot. Oh, absolutely. Did you want to be a military pilot?

156
00:12:22.18 --> 00:12:24.18
Yes

157
00:12:24.18 --> 00:12:27.62
It took go back a little to go back a little bit more I

158
00:12:29.14 --> 00:12:32.42
grew up in the dawn of the victory of World War two and

159
00:12:33.42 --> 00:12:40.22
This time I became fascinated with aviation and then and I was really fascinated about combat

160
00:12:41.02 --> 00:12:44.62
And I found it very intriguing and as I learned more about

161
00:12:45.14 --> 00:12:49.30
Those guys that flew out of the 8th Air Force in East England in England

162
00:12:49.30 --> 00:12:56.14
And those long missions and B 17s and B 24s and I learned about the loss rates

163
00:12:57.34 --> 00:13:00.82
You know one group would come back and 600 beds would be empty

164
00:13:01.42 --> 00:13:05.70
Who are these people that did that when three four seven were casualties?

165
00:13:06.22 --> 00:13:07.90
And I thought

166
00:13:07.90 --> 00:13:09.70
How in the hell?

167
00:13:09.70 --> 00:13:15.34
You know, it's one thing to go and do that once but if you're the only one that comes back from your whole squadron

168
00:13:15.34 --> 00:13:22.90
Let's wounded on board how and the love of whatever do you get back in another airplane and do that again?

169
00:13:22.90 --> 00:13:26.14
I was fascinated who the hell are these people and

170
00:13:27.02 --> 00:13:31.50
Then you had to ask the question again, you know, I kind of wanted to be a warrior

171
00:13:32.50 --> 00:13:33.46
I

172
00:13:33.46 --> 00:13:40.66
Always thought it was the ultimate in human competition is where the pinnacle is where each other would compete

173
00:13:40.66 --> 00:13:44.50
for the ultimate prize and that's your life and

174
00:13:45.26 --> 00:13:51.50
I would it's fascinated. How can I could I do something like that? And I had to find out one way or another

175
00:13:53.10 --> 00:13:56.86
I had a learning experience a learning problem

176
00:13:57.74 --> 00:14:00.46
It was diagnosed just a few years ago actually

177
00:14:01.02 --> 00:14:05.10
When I was trying to write this book and I was telling people how I read and

178
00:14:06.14 --> 00:14:08.62
How I process things, but it was a

179
00:14:08.62 --> 00:14:10.62
Dislikely

180
00:14:11.06 --> 00:14:15.54
Whatever that is dyslexic and I always had a hard time in school

181
00:14:21.30 --> 00:14:28.18
But that that fascinating that the fascination for whatever the Warriors life was I don't know

182
00:14:28.78 --> 00:14:30.78
Had to find out for myself

183
00:14:30.78 --> 00:14:39.34
Now every young warrior grows up and pretty soon he's a warrior and the time goes by and he becomes the age to be a warrior

184
00:14:39.34 --> 00:14:43.34
Okay, I'm a young guy and I'm in the thing right now

185
00:14:43.34 --> 00:14:48.38
This is warrior and then you walk outside and look around and think well what war am I gonna fight?

186
00:14:48.86 --> 00:14:52.26
It's a small window of opportunity actually and I looked around

187
00:14:52.78 --> 00:14:54.94
Freck it was Vietnam

188
00:14:54.94 --> 00:15:01.26
But I still had to find out and that was something that was kind of gnawing in my in my back

189
00:15:02.14 --> 00:15:07.86
All that time I couldn't wait to do that. I had to find out if little dicky routine can do that and

190
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:14.62
You know our parents gave us some really important things one of his freedom. There's the world out there

191
00:15:14.62 --> 00:15:17.74
I give you life you can make of it what you want

192
00:15:19.90 --> 00:15:21.90
And remember

193
00:15:21.90 --> 00:15:27.86
Well, my mom would take it to air shows and this was in Mercedes, California. And I was a little kid and

194
00:15:28.62 --> 00:15:34.82
I never forget that I was walking up there and there was an RF-84 a reconnaissance F-84

195
00:15:35.90 --> 00:15:37.38
jet

196
00:15:37.38 --> 00:15:39.38
Smell like a jet curing

197
00:15:39.78 --> 00:15:46.54
And I remember looking in the windows the camera windows and they had scantily clad females in there

198
00:15:46.54 --> 00:15:48.66
And I thought wow this is really cool

199
00:15:48.66 --> 00:15:52.78
And then I saw that pilot standing there and he looked really cool

200
00:15:52.78 --> 00:15:57.78
Man had his G suit on his flight suit on this had his wings and he was a pilot man

201
00:15:57.78 --> 00:16:01.02
And he was a flyer he could go and fly that airplane

202
00:16:01.82 --> 00:16:04.94
And I stood there and looked up at him and my mother

203
00:16:06.06 --> 00:16:10.30
What she said right then was really important kind of a turning place in my life

204
00:16:10.30 --> 00:16:14.98
And my mom look at looked at me and she says dick would you like to do that?

205
00:16:14.98 --> 00:16:21.78
I says oh god what I ever but then I said something the fact that I don't think that I could ever achieve that

206
00:16:23.54 --> 00:16:28.50
And she grabbed me by the neck or the nap and she said in no uncertain terms

207
00:16:28.78 --> 00:16:35.46
Looked at me and she says if you want to do that you can and don't you ever say that you can't do something like that

208
00:16:36.14 --> 00:16:38.14
And that was the the motivation

209
00:16:38.14 --> 00:16:46.26
Like she says you can do if you can dream it you can do it and the only way to fail is if you quit and

210
00:16:46.74 --> 00:16:52.22
To achieve all those things that you dream about all you have to do is manage the motivation

211
00:16:53.02 --> 00:16:57.70
And so on that day and that castle our four space in front of that f-84

212
00:16:58.38 --> 00:17:00.38
She instilled the fact that I

213
00:17:00.82 --> 00:17:02.82
Could really do that

214
00:17:02.82 --> 00:17:07.98
No, is she able to take that focus and get it towards your grades in school?

215
00:17:08.14 --> 00:17:10.14
No according to your book

216
00:17:10.94 --> 00:17:15.62
Problems in school and you just and that was driven somewhat by your dyslexia

217
00:17:15.62 --> 00:17:23.54
It was by dyslexia. Nobody could I nobody could identify it or nobody could evaluate what the hell was Burt was

218
00:17:24.06 --> 00:17:27.14
Dicky having a problem in school. In fact my dad

219
00:17:27.14 --> 00:17:32.42
Right after grade school right after high school. He sent me down to a university

220
00:17:32.42 --> 00:17:38.30
I think in Southern California for an aptitude test. Hey, it's just you know, who is this kid?

221
00:17:38.30 --> 00:17:42.46
Is he what what's his aptitude is? Is he a college type and and whatever and

222
00:17:43.46 --> 00:17:47.66
I went down and took the test and pop came back and says

223
00:17:49.86 --> 00:17:52.34
It scored very very low and

224
00:17:52.34 --> 00:18:01.70
Well like in English is an example communication skills, but I I was very extremely high and mechanical

225
00:18:04.46 --> 00:18:10.66
Very high mechanical aptitude and so then I wasn't going to be a college guy obviously

226
00:18:12.10 --> 00:18:17.42
And not to jump ahead too much, but I went in the Air Force right out of high school and

227
00:18:17.42 --> 00:18:23.74
And it's I was going through advancement and so forth to be a lieutenant colonel

228
00:18:23.74 --> 00:18:28.38
I had to have a college degree so in that time they had a bootstrap program

229
00:18:29.26 --> 00:18:34.34
We talk about motivation again the bootstrap program. So here I am. I'm gonna be a lieutenant colonel

230
00:18:34.34 --> 00:18:38.74
I got about 18 years in the service and they sent me off to

231
00:18:39.66 --> 00:18:41.94
clean killin clean Texas

232
00:18:42.62 --> 00:18:46.66
the American Technological University and for about

233
00:18:46.66 --> 00:18:53.58
A semester or whatever it was three or four or five months and I went out there by myself and

234
00:18:53.94 --> 00:18:56.66
In a little apartment now here this older guy

235
00:18:56.82 --> 00:19:00.90
You know it's been to Vietnam and we've been through the the Cold War and

236
00:19:01.74 --> 00:19:07.86
Nuclear alert and stuff and I'm looking around all these kids out here drinking and racing hill and chasing girls

237
00:19:09.06 --> 00:19:13.26
And I wasn't doing any of that like and dawn on me and I says hey

238
00:19:13.26 --> 00:19:20.66
You know you did have problems with this and I thought this is college. You know, geez

239
00:19:21.22 --> 00:19:23.22
It's always scared of college

240
00:19:23.22 --> 00:19:28.46
Wonder how I'll do and then I thought what the motivation was I got a family and two kids

241
00:19:28.46 --> 00:19:35.70
I need to get promoted and if I don't I'm gonna give up retirement and all those other benefits and stuff and the humility of coming back and

242
00:19:35.86 --> 00:19:37.86
failing this thing and

243
00:19:38.66 --> 00:19:40.86
So I figured out a way I

244
00:19:40.86 --> 00:19:48.78
Got a briefcase and I put a tape recorder in it and I sat down in that seat right in front of that professor

245
00:19:49.98 --> 00:19:53.86
And I didn't have anything else. I wasn't drinking and I wasn't chasing girls or anything

246
00:19:54.06 --> 00:19:56.54
So every every word that he had a wrote

247
00:19:57.54 --> 00:20:04.30
Notes, you know detailed notes of this thing and here this dyslexic kid that had a

248
00:20:05.10 --> 00:20:07.10
problem in any kind of academic situation

249
00:20:08.10 --> 00:20:09.78
he graduated

250
00:20:09.78 --> 00:20:11.50
with

251
00:20:11.50 --> 00:20:13.50
the BS degree on

252
00:20:14.18 --> 00:20:16.58
The Dean's list and a foro average

253
00:20:17.74 --> 00:20:21.30
Holy man has and it's just it's just the motivation

254
00:20:21.46 --> 00:20:26.22
So you can accomplish anything if you can die it through is manage the motivation

255
00:20:26.30 --> 00:20:30.50
If you keep yourself motivated or more or motivate those around you

256
00:20:31.30 --> 00:20:34.18
It's an example of the world flight project. I

257
00:20:34.18 --> 00:20:42.62
Kept thinking and we had some horrible times, you know challenges the five and a half years with no money having to build this big huge

258
00:20:42.62 --> 00:20:44.62
airplane ourselves by hand

259
00:20:46.62 --> 00:20:52.22
The flight test dangerous as hell, I don't know how I ever survived that thing this frail little airplane

260
00:20:52.22 --> 00:20:54.22
It was gonna go 29,000 miles

261
00:20:54.78 --> 00:20:56.78
Wow

262
00:20:57.02 --> 00:21:00.30
And and when things were falling apart and I want to give up

263
00:21:00.30 --> 00:21:05.18
About motivation again, I would go out in a special place in this little

264
00:21:06.18 --> 00:21:12.90
Crummy little airport Mojave abandoned semi-abandoned military field and in Mojave, California

265
00:21:12.90 --> 00:21:18.42
And the high desert next to Edwards Air Force Base and I have a special place that I would sit down in the hangar

266
00:21:19.46 --> 00:21:22.90
by the hangar looking the ramp and looking out over the desert and

267
00:21:22.90 --> 00:21:29.94
And and some you know just insurmountable problem difficulties

268
00:21:30.94 --> 00:21:37.74
And I close my eyes and I would try to imagine what it would feel like to land at Edwards Air Force Base

269
00:21:38.26 --> 00:21:41.50
Having accomplished aviation's last milestone

270
00:21:41.98 --> 00:21:47.54
And I close my eyes and let that feeling permeate through my psychic and I'd realize

271
00:21:47.54 --> 00:21:54.78
This is the last you know the last milestone in aviation the unrefew of world flight

272
00:21:55.82 --> 00:22:01.66
And I think and I'd loud after thinking about that and let it settle into my psychic and thought

273
00:22:02.18 --> 00:22:04.18
You know I'd feel pretty good

274
00:22:05.42 --> 00:22:10.66
I'd feel pretty good and for five and a half years when I was really down and dejected

275
00:22:10.66 --> 00:22:13.82
I'd sit out there and close my eyes and try to visualize that and

276
00:22:13.82 --> 00:22:17.70
Then that was managed managed the motivation

277
00:22:19.10 --> 00:22:25.30
And I found that that's really a key thing and I try to tell people about that you can dream it you can do it

278
00:22:26.34 --> 00:22:30.06
But just manage the motivation and you can accomplish anything

279
00:22:30.86 --> 00:22:36.22
Now as you're growing up you also you got your brother Bert, right right

280
00:22:36.74 --> 00:22:39.82
And it sounds like you two are thick as thieves and everything that you're doing

281
00:22:39.82 --> 00:22:46.94
Well not really we were five years apart. So therefore we were never in the same school at the same time. I was gone

282
00:22:48.86 --> 00:22:55.02
Went to a high school and and being five years apart. I was gone a year and before he even started

283
00:22:55.70 --> 00:22:59.58
So we weren't really all that close I guess in some ways

284
00:22:59.86 --> 00:23:05.18
But you know I guess it seems like you can't you became close later. Well, yeah, we were brothers

285
00:23:05.18 --> 00:23:11.10
He was you know, I was the guy that was riding motorcycles and getting chased by the cops and

286
00:23:12.38 --> 00:23:16.22
buzzing around Friday night high school games and being the long-haired

287
00:23:17.82 --> 00:23:23.90
Elvis Presley haircut with dirty Levi's hanging on the last the last hair of my ass and so forth and

288
00:23:24.50 --> 00:23:27.78
You know, he was the one that was more studious. I think that

289
00:23:28.70 --> 00:23:30.70
that the education thing

290
00:23:30.70 --> 00:23:36.82
The two brothers he got a lot of he got a lot of what I needed to go to school

291
00:23:37.30 --> 00:23:40.98
Of course, I took away from him some of the mechanical part of it

292
00:23:40.98 --> 00:23:46.50
And so forth and that's what so you're growing up in the 50s because you're born in what 30?

293
00:23:47.14 --> 00:23:53.62
38 38 right so you're growing up in the 50s. This is an in California in the 50s Elvis

294
00:23:54.66 --> 00:23:55.66
motorcycles

295
00:23:55.66 --> 00:24:00.90
Levi's jeans like you had the whole thing going on right out of a movie American graffiti. That's it

296
00:24:00.90 --> 00:24:06.94
If you remember that movie, yeah, I mean I thought that they had done American graffiti in my little town

297
00:24:07.26 --> 00:24:10.82
Because all those characters I knew every one of them. Oh, it's a school with him

298
00:24:11.94 --> 00:24:16.98
Now you also mentioned the book that you were scared of heights. Yes. What was that all about?

299
00:24:16.98 --> 00:24:23.50
Ah well phobia well

300
00:24:25.82 --> 00:24:31.78
I call it's Ed's phobia. I think I was really really and my brother and I both have Ed's phobia

301
00:24:31.78 --> 00:24:38.62
If you get I couldn't write in glass elevators or I couldn't look off the tall building or look over a cliff and

302
00:24:39.46 --> 00:24:41.34
I didn't realize

303
00:24:41.34 --> 00:24:49.78
You know I just later on during the the Voyager project is that I thought that phobias were just sissy things

304
00:24:51.14 --> 00:24:55.66
So what you're what are you scared of height not heights, but you're scared of of

305
00:24:56.22 --> 00:25:00.10
What spiders were scared of being in a tight place?

306
00:25:01.98 --> 00:25:04.66
And I just thought that was that was a sissy thing

307
00:25:04.66 --> 00:25:11.78
But it was but the fear of heights it it became a debilitating phobia

308
00:25:12.38 --> 00:25:15.62
that I'd go over next to a cliff or something and

309
00:25:17.18 --> 00:25:21.50
Become cold and clammy uncontrolled shaking extreme heart rates

310
00:25:22.94 --> 00:25:24.58
inability to

311
00:25:24.58 --> 00:25:27.90
in the ragged edge of being panicked and

312
00:25:27.90 --> 00:25:36.22
And so I've had that all my life I guess I just how do you keep cured of that stay the hell away from

313
00:25:37.50 --> 00:25:41.74
High places don't look off big cliffs and stuff and I thought everybody had that

314
00:25:41.74 --> 00:25:46.74
You know you're supposed to be afraid of being high for crying out loud. So I just thought that was normal

315
00:25:47.82 --> 00:25:49.82
until

316
00:25:50.26 --> 00:25:52.26
That particular thing happened

317
00:25:53.50 --> 00:25:55.70
During the stress of our Voyager project

318
00:25:55.70 --> 00:26:01.30
That there was a lot of stress mental stress and stuff for that. You know no money

319
00:26:02.02 --> 00:26:07.54
Trying to do with volunteers people volunteers would not show up. They'd only do half of it and

320
00:26:08.50 --> 00:26:10.50
It was very stressful

321
00:26:10.74 --> 00:26:12.74
especially with no money and

322
00:26:13.14 --> 00:26:17.90
The thing is the hell with it. We're gonna do it anyway. It just it's a neat thing

323
00:26:18.50 --> 00:26:21.98
So I took up and took off in my long easy that I built

324
00:26:21.98 --> 00:26:27.58
One of the first models that my brother designed called long easy

325
00:26:28.70 --> 00:26:32.50
And I took off one day and I did the first turn out of traffic

326
00:26:33.58 --> 00:26:35.58
And it hit me

327
00:26:36.98 --> 00:26:40.30
That debilitating phobia happened to me in flight

328
00:26:40.30 --> 00:26:46.02
I never had any problem in flight just looking over the edge of a cliff and it hit me it hit me so bad

329
00:26:47.14 --> 00:26:49.14
Cold and clammy heart race

330
00:26:49.14 --> 00:26:51.98
Inability to do almost anything

331
00:26:53.14 --> 00:26:58.26
And it skidded the airplane around and finally damn near crashed on the runway trying to get back

332
00:27:00.46 --> 00:27:06.58
And taxied in and then sitting there by myself and the heart rate would slow down

333
00:27:07.38 --> 00:27:09.38
You could kind of relax a little bit

334
00:27:10.02 --> 00:27:15.98
And then I thought holy crap dick. You're right in the middle of the Voyager project. This is your project

335
00:27:15.98 --> 00:27:22.30
You're gonna be the commander. You're gonna be the guy you're gonna be the guy that lands at Eddard's Air Force Base and taxied up

336
00:27:22.82 --> 00:27:24.42
for the whole world

337
00:27:24.42 --> 00:27:26.42
having accomplished this

338
00:27:26.62 --> 00:27:28.26
great

339
00:27:28.26 --> 00:27:29.90
milestone achievement

340
00:27:29.90 --> 00:27:31.90
And I can't fly

341
00:27:31.98 --> 00:27:34.46
I'm screwed. What the hell am I gonna do? I

342
00:27:36.26 --> 00:27:39.50
Knew we're not away that I could never tell anybody about that

343
00:27:39.62 --> 00:27:44.18
You know who in the hell would ever fly with me again and rightfully so I wouldn't blame him

344
00:27:44.18 --> 00:27:51.10
That's a this guy for some unknown reason could have a debilitating phobia. I mean, that's a grounding thing

345
00:27:52.34 --> 00:27:54.94
And it so happened and it was in Las Vegas

346
00:27:55.58 --> 00:27:57.86
It was in the Hilton Hotel

347
00:27:58.70 --> 00:28:03.58
And it was sitting at the bar that some real strange things happened fortuitous

348
00:28:04.46 --> 00:28:09.42
What happened at the bars in Vegas? Well, it was in a bar, but that wasn't the point

349
00:28:09.42 --> 00:28:14.62
I remember for some reason I I set down next to some guy and

350
00:28:15.46 --> 00:28:19.82
We struck up a conversation and I found out that he ran he runs a clinic

351
00:28:20.50 --> 00:28:22.50
for fear of flight

352
00:28:22.62 --> 00:28:24.62
you know people have that

353
00:28:24.66 --> 00:28:32.22
Passengers and people come in and they go through a program about time to overcome fear of flight. I said what?

354
00:28:33.50 --> 00:28:35.30
Boy I

355
00:28:35.30 --> 00:28:37.30
Needed to know about this

356
00:28:37.30 --> 00:28:43.02
And so as it turned out he was very forthcoming and I would ask questions, you know all the details of

357
00:28:44.22 --> 00:28:46.62
The program and how you do that what is I?

358
00:28:47.70 --> 00:28:53.66
Mean how do you cure people of this thing for crying out loud and he was very forthcoming and boy

359
00:28:53.66 --> 00:28:58.98
Oh dick he was taking detailed memory notes of everything that happened then I realized

360
00:28:58.98 --> 00:29:07.18
Dick you can never tell anybody about that. In fact, I don't think anybody ever knew until they read my book and

361
00:29:09.18 --> 00:29:16.78
Right and I did it it was a self. It was a self-help a self cure thing and it was really incredible and at the end of myself

362
00:29:18.22 --> 00:29:23.58
My self-taught clinic. I have no fear of flights. No fear of heights any place

363
00:29:24.14 --> 00:29:26.14
I thought wait a minute

364
00:29:26.14 --> 00:29:30.30
You're supposed to have a little bit of fear because if you fall you could get hurt really bad

365
00:29:31.46 --> 00:29:35.30
What was the crux of getting through that well?

366
00:29:35.86 --> 00:29:39.26
Cuz just so for context for everybody that doesn't know the whole story

367
00:29:39.26 --> 00:29:43.58
I mean when you're working on the Voyager flight when you had this so you've been you've been scared of

368
00:29:44.06 --> 00:29:47.30
Heights your whole life, but you'd also been a pilot your whole life at this point

369
00:29:47.30 --> 00:29:51.38
You'd flown in Vietnam you'd parachute you done a bunch of things that had to do with heights

370
00:29:51.38 --> 00:29:53.38
But then for some reason

371
00:29:53.38 --> 00:29:59.34
In the middle of this effort to go and fly around the world in the Voyager aircraft

372
00:29:59.98 --> 00:30:05.02
You're getting another little aircraft, which by the way, I look at your your brother's little aircrafts that he built

373
00:30:05.02 --> 00:30:09.54
They're like little one-seaters. They look like you could feel like a little model airplane that I used to build right

374
00:30:09.54 --> 00:30:15.70
So maybe that's what you were scared of but you get up on this flight and all of a sudden you get this well height panic

375
00:30:15.70 --> 00:30:16.74
Yeah, see

376
00:30:16.74 --> 00:30:18.70
When this thing the panic happened

377
00:30:18.70 --> 00:30:26.46
I've already been through my civilian thing and I was a flight instructor and I went in the Air Force and went to pilot training with the combat

378
00:30:26.98 --> 00:30:33.62
Set nuclear alert all those things have already been done before I finally did my 20 years in one microsecond by the way

379
00:30:34.46 --> 00:30:36.78
And we could talk about what was going on then

380
00:30:38.86 --> 00:30:40.86
So anyway, I got out at

381
00:30:40.86 --> 00:30:48.02
20 years in a microsecond and then I joined my brother and then we did the round the world thing. So I had I had flown a lot and

382
00:30:49.22 --> 00:30:55.50
None of that phobia or scariness or anything ever manifests itself in flight, you know, I could you know

383
00:30:55.50 --> 00:30:57.50
Here on fighter pilot for crying out loud

384
00:30:57.86 --> 00:30:59.86
we do air shows and

385
00:31:01.02 --> 00:31:07.90
I just felt right at home and there was never any situation until that one particular thing under a lot of stress that

386
00:31:07.90 --> 00:31:13.22
It finally crawled out of my psyche and hit me really bad and I had to cure myself of it

387
00:31:13.26 --> 00:31:15.26
So what did you do to cure yourself though?

388
00:31:15.94 --> 00:31:17.42
well

389
00:31:17.42 --> 00:31:21.94
First of all, you have to get all the symptoms going. I mean real quick and so I was in

390
00:31:22.66 --> 00:31:28.70
You know, there's some of these hotels that have a matrium and an atrium inside and you come out of your room

391
00:31:28.70 --> 00:31:33.82
And you're looking inside the hotel and there, you know, you look over the edge and it's really a long ways down there

392
00:31:33.82 --> 00:31:39.02
And you go up to the edge and you get all the symptoms going all of them

393
00:31:39.54 --> 00:31:45.74
And it took all the willpower I could almost drag myself grab the edge and pull myself up and look at it

394
00:31:45.74 --> 00:31:47.82
And the more that I'd look down the more

395
00:31:48.58 --> 00:31:54.06
The more this phobia would just explode into my psychic heart rate breath

396
00:31:54.74 --> 00:31:58.10
skin cold and clammy and uncontrolled shaking and

397
00:31:58.10 --> 00:32:05.26
The first thing you do with this you get all the symptoms going and then you identify

398
00:32:06.14 --> 00:32:13.10
One part of your body and you concentrate on it totally on that particular thing and I chose my right elbow

399
00:32:13.62 --> 00:32:21.30
Because it was shaking and I concentrate as much as I can and I finally after maybe no kidding after 20 minutes

400
00:32:21.30 --> 00:32:26.42
I could get that one elbow to stop to stop shaking

401
00:32:26.42 --> 00:32:30.94
And I says well, that's really cool. I says well, I'm gonna try the elbow

402
00:32:30.94 --> 00:32:34.82
So soon as I would go to work on the other elbow the first one to start again

403
00:32:35.14 --> 00:32:37.14
Then you'd have to go back and do that

404
00:32:37.66 --> 00:32:41.42
But that was it was a procedure that you would get one

405
00:32:42.14 --> 00:32:47.10
You would slow down one arm and then you were able to to control it

406
00:32:47.70 --> 00:32:53.38
Boy, you went to the other arm or the right leg or the right calf or one part of it

407
00:32:53.38 --> 00:32:59.74
And so you go through this procedure you drag yourself up there and and this phobia would just explode on you

408
00:32:59.90 --> 00:33:03.86
Everything was going then you go down right elbow left elbow right knee left knee

409
00:33:03.86 --> 00:33:09.58
And I don't know don't until you got them all calm and if you concentrate on it you can keep them quiet

410
00:33:10.22 --> 00:33:14.94
But soon as you would try to do something else boom that explode again, but what I'm getting that is

411
00:33:15.54 --> 00:33:17.54
as you go through this procedure and

412
00:33:19.66 --> 00:33:21.66
You can can finally

413
00:33:21.66 --> 00:33:23.26
I

414
00:33:23.26 --> 00:33:29.94
Start to control everything and then your skin doesn't cold and clammy anymore and you feel relaxed

415
00:33:29.94 --> 00:33:35.54
But the problem was I can control my breathing. I can decide when to take a breath and not

416
00:33:36.22 --> 00:33:41.18
But what do you do about this damn thing in my chest? It's going like mad really high

417
00:33:41.70 --> 00:33:46.26
Really high heart rates and then if it's the thing called biofeedback

418
00:33:46.26 --> 00:33:52.58
And they talk about how you go with biofeedback to be able to control your heart rate and

419
00:33:53.38 --> 00:33:55.38
then pretty soon I

420
00:33:55.50 --> 00:34:02.02
Could go up and if it the tins would happen I go right over left able lift us and just calm everything down and then

421
00:34:02.70 --> 00:34:04.26
eventually

422
00:34:04.26 --> 00:34:09.62
Eventually I had no symptoms whatsoever not even a normal fear of heights on the edge

423
00:34:09.62 --> 00:34:14.42
Got it solved and then

424
00:34:16.34 --> 00:34:18.70
But but then you think hey there's a saying

425
00:34:19.30 --> 00:34:25.14
Back in the corner of Dick's psychic someplace this gremlin could crawl out again

426
00:34:26.18 --> 00:34:31.02
That's why I could never tell anybody about that. You got to keep that one quiet especially the insurance people

427
00:34:31.02 --> 00:34:40.38
Especially the insurance or the FAA and my medical because I knew that that was a grounding a big time grounding item for the FAA

428
00:34:43.50 --> 00:34:46.46
So that let's get back I want to get back to

429
00:34:46.98 --> 00:34:49.86
Sort of how you got into flying in the first place

430
00:34:50.06 --> 00:34:55.90
I'm going to go back to the book here and again look the book is awesome so many so many details inside the book

431
00:34:55.90 --> 00:34:58.46
Just go get the book. I'm going to read some highlights from it

432
00:34:58.46 --> 00:35:03.26
Well, but there's plenty more highlights that we're not going to read but just to kind of talk through the story a little bit

433
00:35:03.26 --> 00:35:04.38
You say this throughout my childhood

434
00:35:04.38 --> 00:35:10.58
I struggled with academics a struggle that was almost debilitating regardless of how hard I might try it seemed I was doomed for failure

435
00:35:10.58 --> 00:35:14.50
I was held back a year in elementary school, but nothing improved by the time I reached high school

436
00:35:14.70 --> 00:35:18.74
Pop decided to have a battery of test run to help me clarify my strengths and weaknesses

437
00:35:18.74 --> 00:35:25.98
It was determined. I had exceptional high mechanical aptitude, but skills in other areas suggested. I was not college material

438
00:35:25.98 --> 00:35:31.38
Decades of decades later would pass before it was discovered. I suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia

439
00:35:31.98 --> 00:35:36.34
What I did know was I had a gift and a passion for flying and

440
00:35:36.46 --> 00:35:40.18
Aspired to make my mark doing something in that field fresh out of high school

441
00:35:40.18 --> 00:35:45.66
I could hardly wait for the opportunity to fly high in the stratosphere and make those white vapor contrails

442
00:35:45.66 --> 00:35:47.66
So I signed up for the United States Air Force

443
00:35:48.30 --> 00:35:54.82
Aviation cadet program after taking all the tests and going through the rigorous physical and written exams. I was told I was qualified

444
00:35:54.82 --> 00:35:59.70
I was not qualified to be a pilot even though I was already a civilian commercial pilot

445
00:35:59.82 --> 00:36:04.10
But they had a special program for me. I could become a navigator. I

446
00:36:04.90 --> 00:36:09.14
Couldn't believe it. I was fully physically qualified. I had fighter pilots eyes

447
00:36:09.70 --> 00:36:13.14
But did not score the best in academics. I suspect that I had

448
00:36:13.58 --> 00:36:18.02
That that had everything to do with their decision to reject my application for pilot training

449
00:36:18.02 --> 00:36:20.70
I complained to my Air Force recruiting sergeant

450
00:36:20.70 --> 00:36:28.42
He told me all I had to do is when I got to pre-flight at Lackland Air Force Base and San Antonio was tell them about my civilian pilot status

451
00:36:28.42 --> 00:36:30.42
And they would change me right over to pilot training

452
00:36:30.82 --> 00:36:36.06
That was the first that was one of the first lies told to me in my new way of life away from home

453
00:36:36.06 --> 00:36:39.26
It all seemed so simple and I signed the dotted line

454
00:36:39.94 --> 00:36:44.06
This is the first time I'd ever been away from my mom my family and the safety of my sheltered life

455
00:36:44.06 --> 00:36:50.10
I stepped off the bus in my low-hanging Levi's and long greased up Elvis haircut. I soon discovered

456
00:36:50.10 --> 00:36:55.62
I would lose my cool hair and during the next two weeks would only be allowed to mutter yes, sir or no, sir

457
00:36:55.90 --> 00:36:59.14
This one shit hot civilian pilot was now off to Nav school

458
00:36:59.14 --> 00:37:05.14
It nearly broke my heart along with my spirit the cadets assigned to pilot training were issued brand new shiny helmets

459
00:37:05.38 --> 00:37:10.58
While I was issued three large books of celestial site reduction tables

460
00:37:12.54 --> 00:37:18.38
So that's your introduction you get you get a this assignment to be a navigator you go to nav class

461
00:37:18.38 --> 00:37:22.98
You end up as a backseater as a Rio or radar intercept officer

462
00:37:23.46 --> 00:37:25.46
You get stationed in Oregon

463
00:37:25.94 --> 00:37:29.26
From Oregon you get stationed up in Iceland

464
00:37:30.26 --> 00:37:37.26
And then when you get to Iceland you you apply for pilot training again and you get accepted

465
00:37:38.46 --> 00:37:43.42
And and when you get accepted for that you get assigned to a air transport squadron

466
00:37:43.42 --> 00:37:47.90
Which is flying in and out of Vietnam which now the Vietnam war is kind of getting?

467
00:37:48.66 --> 00:37:53.02
Kind of getting started or starting to ask away and I should say well yeah, what happened

468
00:37:56.14 --> 00:38:03.14
Yeah, I had no interest in navigating big cargo airplanes and I can forth so then I went into the fighters

469
00:38:03.14 --> 00:38:07.50
you know I was flying fighters, but in the backseat as a radar intercept officer and

470
00:38:07.50 --> 00:38:15.42
And then I applied for pilot training for some reason if I fly in the backseat long enough according to the Air Force

471
00:38:15.42 --> 00:38:17.42
I got a lot smarter

472
00:38:17.46 --> 00:38:20.18
So then I was smart enough that I could go to pilot training

473
00:38:21.38 --> 00:38:28.70
So when I was waiting for to go to pilot training I was assigned to C124's cargo big old

474
00:38:29.42 --> 00:38:34.02
They called the big old shaky and while I was waiting to go to pilot training

475
00:38:34.02 --> 00:38:40.94
I was actually flying as a navigator now and this big huge cargo airplane

476
00:38:40.94 --> 00:38:45.66
This is in you know right in the middle of Vietnam war back and forth the Saigon and

477
00:38:46.58 --> 00:38:48.58
as it turned out

478
00:38:49.34 --> 00:38:56.90
Those hours that I spent at 8,000 feet in a C124 waiting to go to pilot training gave me some incredible

479
00:38:58.34 --> 00:39:03.06
Understanding that what I was going to face later on in life to fly this Voyager around the world

480
00:39:03.06 --> 00:39:07.10
And as it turned out having had that Nav experience

481
00:39:07.70 --> 00:39:13.26
That may have been that may have been critical to the success of the flight around the world in the Voyager

482
00:39:13.66 --> 00:39:18.22
So I don't know maybe maybe fade goes around and it comes back around again

483
00:39:18.90 --> 00:39:20.90
Who can tell?

484
00:39:22.46 --> 00:39:28.96
So but you do end up finally like you said you got a lot smarter as you as you flew around in the back of the

485
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:34.86
Airplanes you got a lot smarter you got accepted for pilot training and you say this in the book before I knew it pilot training

486
00:39:35.30 --> 00:39:39.46
67d was ready to begin and my time as a navigator came to an end

487
00:39:39.46 --> 00:39:44.86
I was off off to Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas right on the Rio Grande River west of San Antonio

488
00:39:45.18 --> 00:39:51.30
Although I didn't appreciate it at the time my experience as a navigator over vast stretches of open ocean and training with radar

489
00:39:51.34 --> 00:39:58.50
Would prove to be a vital factor in the successful completion of Voyager's flight years later because of my academic challenges

490
00:39:58.50 --> 00:40:04.10
I knew how I had to work clever work hard and maintain my motivation to be successful in pilot training

491
00:40:04.10 --> 00:40:07.82
I would sneak a tape recorder into class by concealing into my briefcase

492
00:40:07.82 --> 00:40:13.88
I made it a point to sit front and center row so I could capture every word of each lecture with the help of these tape

493
00:40:13.88 --> 00:40:21.38
Lectures I arduously wrote impeccable notes to study from and aced every test. I graduated number one in my

494
00:40:21.66 --> 00:40:26.90
Pilot training class granted. I had a huge head start with more flying time log than many of the instructors

495
00:40:26.90 --> 00:40:33.52
But I never told anyone I was a civilian pilot. I was a civilian instructor pilot. I let them believe I was just that good

496
00:40:35.50 --> 00:40:37.98
Upon graduation I was awarded my dream

497
00:40:38.98 --> 00:40:41.94
F100 Super Saber affectionately known as the Hun

498
00:40:42.74 --> 00:40:48.76
Out of 360 graduates, there were only two F100s offered with that

499
00:40:48.76 --> 00:40:52.58
I was off to real life and death combat in Vietnam

500
00:40:52.58 --> 00:40:58.22
So you kept it a secret that you were a civilian how many hours did you have?

501
00:40:58.22 --> 00:41:00.70
Well, see I wanted to go to the Air Force pilot training

502
00:41:00.70 --> 00:41:06.62
I can go back to that day that I stood there and it at March Air Force Base looking up at that fighter pilot

503
00:41:06.90 --> 00:41:11.34
You know, he was a god from a different place and here after all those

504
00:41:12.18 --> 00:41:16.66
The interim years I was going to be able to do that now. I always made a joke

505
00:41:16.66 --> 00:41:23.26
That I always thought if you want to be a real Air Force fighter pilot, you had to go to Luke Air Force Base and you had to

506
00:41:23.82 --> 00:41:28.62
You had to train in the hunt. It was a difficult airplane to fly. I had some really

507
00:41:29.38 --> 00:41:31.38
strange things about the airplane

508
00:41:31.90 --> 00:41:33.90
But that was more of a challenge. I

509
00:41:34.22 --> 00:41:40.14
Says if you want to be a real fighter pilot, you got to go through Luke Gunnery School in the F100

510
00:41:40.14 --> 00:41:46.58
And so I talked about that during my pilot training days. You know, I was bragging it's I'm going to get an F100

511
00:41:46.58 --> 00:41:54.42
And I says I'll bullshit routine. I says they haven't given a undergraduate pilot training right out of training to go directly to fly this

512
00:41:55.14 --> 00:41:57.14
really weird airplane I

513
00:41:57.26 --> 00:41:59.26
Says that's all right. I says

514
00:41:59.34 --> 00:42:01.34
It's all I have to have is one

515
00:42:02.14 --> 00:42:08.38
Because I'm going to graduate out of 365 pilots in five different bases. That is number one

516
00:42:08.38 --> 00:42:15.22
Well, you talk about a heads up that to bite my bite my tongue a lot because I was up there

517
00:42:15.22 --> 00:42:20.42
You know, I was a civilian flight instructor, but I had been wanting to go to pilot training all my life

518
00:42:20.42 --> 00:42:22.92
I wanted to go to that training and

519
00:42:23.58 --> 00:42:28.98
And I didn't want anybody given any shortcuts or bragging about hey, I'm already a pilot

520
00:42:29.62 --> 00:42:32.86
And the old old hand me says it says that's a lollipop

521
00:42:32.86 --> 00:42:39.34
That I've been wanting to lick for a long time and I want to look at I want to lick every darn bit of it

522
00:42:41.34 --> 00:42:45.10
Now it came to the point when you graduate the class standings

523
00:42:45.86 --> 00:42:47.86
And this is kind of more or less a metaphor

524
00:42:48.42 --> 00:42:55.14
But they have all the assignments written on the on the blackboard saying and there's a curtain and they come up and they say

525
00:42:55.14 --> 00:43:03.38
Okay, who's number one in the class and they open up the curtain and there's all the all the assignments

526
00:43:03.38 --> 00:43:08.90
It and I looked up there and much to my shock there was two F-100s

527
00:43:10.70 --> 00:43:15.86
Now I've been bragging about everybody says oh, bullshit. That's not there's no way but that opened up

528
00:43:16.46 --> 00:43:18.34
They were surprised

529
00:43:18.34 --> 00:43:21.10
But the most surprised person in that whole room

530
00:43:21.78 --> 00:43:23.46
was me I

531
00:43:23.46 --> 00:43:25.62
Had no idea that it would be there

532
00:43:26.42 --> 00:43:33.34
And I walked up just like yeah, I knew it all the time. Yes. I didn't know it's squat all the time

533
00:43:34.50 --> 00:43:38.78
And of course then we went to Gunnery school and from there on to Vietnam

534
00:43:39.14 --> 00:43:45.38
So when you were coming through as a pilot a civilian pilot structure like how many hours of flying did you have?

535
00:43:46.26 --> 00:43:48.26
well

536
00:43:48.26 --> 00:43:51.26
This is a guess. I probably had a couple thousand hours

537
00:43:51.26 --> 00:43:54.58
So Dave Burke how much of an advantage is that oh?

538
00:43:54.98 --> 00:43:59.14
Going through pilot training when you have a couple thousand hours worth of flight

539
00:43:59.14 --> 00:44:03.94
Well, it was a flight instructor thing too. See I was I sold it on the day

540
00:44:04.66 --> 00:44:07.82
I sold it on the day that I was 16 my 16th birthday

541
00:44:08.74 --> 00:44:12.58
My mom drove me out and I sold it in a little sesson 140 and then I

542
00:44:12.58 --> 00:44:21.22
She took me down to the DMV and I did my driver sesson and then I could drive my mom home for the first time

543
00:44:21.58 --> 00:44:22.86
so I was

544
00:44:22.86 --> 00:44:24.34
so I was a

545
00:44:24.34 --> 00:44:32.70
pilot before and then your 17th birthday the day that you needed to be to be a private pilot that I could carry passengers and so

546
00:44:32.70 --> 00:44:37.50
for and then at 18 years old it could be a commercial pilot and

547
00:44:37.50 --> 00:44:40.38
And flying structure

548
00:44:42.82 --> 00:44:48.90
So Dave what's the assessment you have two thousand hours worth of pilot time and you're going through pilot training

549
00:44:48.90 --> 00:44:56.12
That's definitely gonna help but in in Dick's offense that can that can cut both ways and when I was in flight school the kids now

550
00:44:56.12 --> 00:45:00.46
Nobody nobody hit it. You know you couldn't hide it. I think when I was going through if you had flight time everybody knew it

551
00:45:01.06 --> 00:45:02.86
Some of the best students had experience

552
00:45:02.86 --> 00:45:07.90
but some of the worst students were the ones that had experience too, so I think you you obviously had to keep that to yourself and

553
00:45:08.74 --> 00:45:15.34
You have to not reveal your bad habits or your habits that you have brought as an aviator and you got to pretend like it's all new

554
00:45:15.62 --> 00:45:22.58
So having flight experience mostly helps but it's I saw kids struggle a lot because they didn't want to learn a new way of doing it

555
00:45:22.58 --> 00:45:29.46
So a few guys that had a flight time I didn't get through the program particularly because they were unwilling to adapt to a new way of doing it

556
00:45:29.46 --> 00:45:34.26
Sounds like you didn't have that Dave Dave. You're exactly right because it had to be very careful of that

557
00:45:34.38 --> 00:45:38.06
But it wasn't the fact that I was I was going to be

558
00:45:38.98 --> 00:45:40.98
Like the civilians do it better or something

559
00:45:41.54 --> 00:45:46.42
But I was just I noticed that I was just amazed about how different things were it's all

560
00:45:46.78 --> 00:45:48.46
proceduralized

561
00:45:48.46 --> 00:45:50.78
like in military pilot training

562
00:45:51.26 --> 00:45:57.70
It's to enter the pattern is exactly flights. There's a bridge you'd have to overfly and then there was a there was a

563
00:45:57.70 --> 00:46:02.30
House farmers pump house on his thing and then you turn down when and it was all

564
00:46:02.74 --> 00:46:06.82
proceduralized, you know brace talk trim turn

565
00:46:07.66 --> 00:46:12.22
Very regimented see very regimented and it was amazing

566
00:46:12.22 --> 00:46:18.46
I thought you know somebody that farmer goes out there and tears down that pump house none of these guys could get back

567
00:46:19.66 --> 00:46:23.50
That it's just a procedure and but that's that's the way it was

568
00:46:23.50 --> 00:46:27.86
But the thing was that I sit there and remembered as a as a little kid

569
00:46:28.14 --> 00:46:35.10
Sitting there in Dineuba picking grapes or something and looking up and see those contrails a single contrail

570
00:46:35.26 --> 00:46:41.54
So high that I could not see what was making them and I looked up at that thing and never forget I says damn

571
00:46:41.54 --> 00:46:47.86
That's got it. There's nothing else. I got to do it. I mean the desire to be at the pointy end of that contrail

572
00:46:47.86 --> 00:46:53.90
Was overwhelming here again the mode the motivation and

573
00:46:54.66 --> 00:46:59.74
There it was two sabers up for grabs and you got one of them. I got one

574
00:47:01.30 --> 00:47:03.70
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit in the book here

575
00:47:03.70 --> 00:47:08.22
You say my assignment to Vietnam as a combat fighter pilot was typical after completing advanced

576
00:47:08.22 --> 00:47:15.30
Gunnery school at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona the this newly minted jet fighter pilot attended Air Force survival school at

577
00:47:15.30 --> 00:47:20.54
Fairchild Air Force both base and Spokane, Washington. It was February dead of winter

578
00:47:20.54 --> 00:47:25.90
I would be stationed in the jungle tropics, but was being trained to survive in waist-deep snow on

579
00:47:26.38 --> 00:47:33.14
Our ride to Vietnam. We made a short stop at Clark Air Force base in hot and sticky Philippines where we received specific jungle

580
00:47:33.58 --> 00:47:41.22
Survival training this environment was definitely more representative of what we would have to face in the jungles of Vietnam instead of having to build a shelter in the snow

581
00:47:41.22 --> 00:47:43.94
We learned how to catch kill and eat boa constructors a

582
00:47:43.94 --> 00:47:46.02
Riving in Vietnam

583
00:47:46.02 --> 00:47:51.30
I had to burn bum a ride from Saigon and a C-130 flying 300 miles north to Fou Cat

584
00:47:51.86 --> 00:47:56.74
Where the 35th tactical fighter wing was located in August of 1967?

585
00:47:56.74 --> 00:48:03.02
I was assigned the 416th squadron as a newbie fighter pilot to get checked out in combat in

586
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:07.34
South Vietnam most of the action was aired a ground in support of the troops

587
00:48:07.34 --> 00:48:14.58
Look in support of the ground troops being a newbie. I was always the tail end Charlie at the end of the four ship formation

588
00:48:15.10 --> 00:48:21.42
We would check in with the forward air controller a guy in a little Cessna and he would fire a smoke rocket into the jungle

589
00:48:21.54 --> 00:48:27.42
We would hit his smoke with our four five hundred pound mark 82 bombs and then return to base

590
00:48:27.42 --> 00:48:30.66
I seldom saw any ground fire coming my way

591
00:48:32.70 --> 00:48:36.26
So that's kind of your introduction you get over there you're doing these missions

592
00:48:36.26 --> 00:48:38.26
And

593
00:48:39.54 --> 00:48:43.66
Then this happens you say finally the day I had been anticipating my entire life arrived

594
00:48:43.66 --> 00:48:50.54
How would I react to being shot at directly my target this day was a bunker complex and the goal is to drop napalm into the tunnels

595
00:48:50.54 --> 00:48:52.54
I flew at low altitude

596
00:48:52.98 --> 00:48:59.48
Assumed a shallow dive angle and snuggled up close to the enemy tunnels to hit the target as I rolled in just off to the

597
00:48:59.48 --> 00:49:07.76
To the right of my bunker target a 50 caliber triple a opened up firing bright tracers the tracer stream was aimed directly

598
00:49:07.92 --> 00:49:13.36
At me and they were close someone down there was trying to kill me specifically

599
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:18.64
This is the moment that would define me as a warrior or as a coward

600
00:49:19.60 --> 00:49:27.20
In 1803 President Jefferson sent Cla Lewis and Clark on the three-year core of discovery to open up the west upon their return

601
00:49:27.20 --> 00:49:34.16
Captain Meriwether Lewis told the president the greatest acceleration a man exhilaration a man can feel is

602
00:49:34.64 --> 00:49:36.64
being shot at and missed as

603
00:49:37.20 --> 00:49:42.08
That long stream of trappers tracers zipped past my canopy

604
00:49:42.24 --> 00:49:47.96
My first thought was not to turn away or hide between my knees or to cry for my mother

605
00:49:48.36 --> 00:49:54.36
It was exactly the opposite my first reaction was the audacity of that son of a bitch to shoot at me

606
00:49:54.36 --> 00:49:58.20
Generally the next thing you do will get you killed

607
00:49:58.96 --> 00:50:05.24
Resetting the site from the bombs to guns. I rolled hard right and headed in to destroy that bastard

608
00:50:05.48 --> 00:50:12.68
Observing this my flight lead screamed routine get the hell out of it there. I argued but sir. He shot at me

609
00:50:13.44 --> 00:50:19.64
He repeated routine get the hell out of there and probably saved my foolish amateur ass

610
00:50:19.64 --> 00:50:25.60
Captain Lewis was right the exhilaration was overwhelming and extremely addictive at last

611
00:50:25.60 --> 00:50:31.28
I had found my answer to how those World War two bomber crews could go out again and again. I

612
00:50:31.84 --> 00:50:38.000
Too could do it. I was a combat warrior. I loved it. I welcomed it. I needed more much more as

613
00:50:38.52 --> 00:50:45.16
My combat career progressed. I was described by some as aggressive among the aggressive I

614
00:50:45.16 --> 00:50:53.08
Had not come to Vietnam to drop bombs on the top of trees as with most hot shot fighter pilots

615
00:50:53.08 --> 00:50:55.08
I came to

616
00:50:55.16 --> 00:50:58.32
Kick some ass win and then go home

617
00:51:01.24 --> 00:51:05.12
That's pretty good introduction to combat it sure was

618
00:51:06.12 --> 00:51:08.12
But then it answered a lot of questions

619
00:51:08.44 --> 00:51:11.84
But it also found it generated something else

620
00:51:11.84 --> 00:51:15.28
I don't know if I talked about that about I call the

621
00:51:16.44 --> 00:51:18.76
There's an adrenaline gland most people have

622
00:51:19.80 --> 00:51:24.44
And I call it a combat gland and I think it's right here on the right side of my neck someplace

623
00:51:25.64 --> 00:51:29.56
Now what happens that it's only active if somebody shoots at you

624
00:51:30.36 --> 00:51:36.28
And then he gets active and what it pumps into your psychic into your system is the most

625
00:51:37.60 --> 00:51:39.60
Well, it's extremely addictive

626
00:51:39.60 --> 00:51:41.40
and

627
00:51:41.40 --> 00:51:42.72
Euphoric

628
00:51:42.72 --> 00:51:48.84
Addictive and euphoric and it's like an addiction a drug addiction. Well, maybe it is a metaphor again

629
00:51:50.36 --> 00:51:54.80
But you need to have more and more and then I found out about misty

630
00:51:55.76 --> 00:51:57.76
by kind of by accident

631
00:51:58.08 --> 00:52:01.64
That that was part of the I think that's the only mistake I made in the book

632
00:52:01.64 --> 00:52:05.60
It's the 35th Tech Fighter Wayne. It's actually a 37 but whatever

633
00:52:05.60 --> 00:52:11.72
Anyway, there was this little little detachment of the very small

634
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.96
Very small group of people in a very highly classified area and doing some really shut-off stuff

635
00:52:19.64 --> 00:52:22.52
And I thought that's what I came here for

636
00:52:23.56 --> 00:52:25.40
Yeah, you you write about

637
00:52:25.40 --> 00:52:32.24
Here the about the about the misty's them the misty the misty's flew the two-seat jet trainer version of the F100

638
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:38.16
Each plane carry two fighter pilots one in the front was the mission commander and the one in the back was the forward air controller

639
00:52:38.32 --> 00:52:41.56
To keep each honest those rule roles alternated

640
00:52:41.76 --> 00:52:46.32
They flew low and fast over the panhandle of North Vietnam Vietnam and Laos

641
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:54.44
Single fighters armed with only a few hundred rounds for the 20 millimeter can cannons and 14 white smoke marking rockets

642
00:52:55.12 --> 00:52:59.36
To be able to see them through the camouflage. They had to get right down in amongst them

643
00:52:59.36 --> 00:53:04.92
So the loss rate was high the first misty commander major bud day who we heard from already today

644
00:53:04.92 --> 00:53:08.44
We shot down early in the operation and spent more than six years as a POW

645
00:53:09.76 --> 00:53:18.32
With air refueling support from the KC 135 tankers over the Gulf of Tonkin misty missions were long four to six hours and laced with plenty of action

646
00:53:19.44 --> 00:53:26.92
Owing to high risks the misty unit was composed of only volunteers and each tour of duty was short only a hundred and twenty days a

647
00:53:26.92 --> 00:53:32.44
High percentage of those who did more than one tour were shot down

648
00:53:34.24 --> 00:53:41.96
Each misty sortie was assigned flights of F105 Thunder chiefs or F4 Phantom fighter bombers if they had a really hot target

649
00:53:42.92 --> 00:53:48.40
They could scramble gun fighters off the alert pad at the Nang to come north and work with them

650
00:53:48.48 --> 00:53:52.12
Most high-value targets in the north were well defended with intense triple a

651
00:53:52.12 --> 00:53:59.36
Once a target was determined the misty's orbited just out of gun range and waited for the fighter bombers to join it took a

652
00:53:59.36 --> 00:54:05.88
Few minutes in the orbit to brief everyone on the target and that gave the gunners plenty of time to pump up adrenaline and exercise

653
00:54:05.88 --> 00:54:11.56
Their trigger fingers the misty had to mark the target with a white smoke rocket and was the first one

654
00:54:11.76 --> 00:54:15.86
Down the shoot the gunners knew the drill as well as the misty's rolled in

655
00:54:15.86 --> 00:54:23.46
Inverted and pulled the nose down toward the target every gun would open up within seconds as tracers flashed by their canopies

656
00:54:23.50 --> 00:54:26.38
They lined up to fire the smoke marking rocket

657
00:54:27.70 --> 00:54:31.34
It was always one hell of a rush a real e-ticket ride

658
00:54:31.94 --> 00:54:38.70
Now this was more like it. This was real combat. This was what I came to Vietnam to do. I had to become a misty

659
00:54:39.30 --> 00:54:45.08
How did I do it? First of all misty's are volunteer. Okay volunteers, okay?

660
00:54:45.08 --> 00:54:47.84
Okay, so I volunteer

661
00:54:48.40 --> 00:54:51.76
So in January of 1968 my life changed dramatically

662
00:54:51.76 --> 00:54:56.56
I was a misty and on my way to the action in North Vietnam

663
00:54:56.72 --> 00:55:00.62
No more making toothpicks out of jungle trees or upsetting monkey colonies

664
00:55:01.16 --> 00:55:07.44
My new world revolved around heavy triple a flak truck parks burning oil fuel dumps

665
00:55:07.76 --> 00:55:12.94
Storage bunkers and stopping the flow of war material along the Ho Chi Minh trail

666
00:55:12.94 --> 00:55:16.08
This was what I was here for

667
00:55:19.90 --> 00:55:21.90
God I loved it

668
00:55:23.34 --> 00:55:27.14
Yes, so they so you only had a hundred and twelve the standard tours 120 days

669
00:55:28.30 --> 00:55:30.30
120 days in misty right and

670
00:55:30.94 --> 00:55:37.26
The the you're going out on these operations. What's the chances you're going out on a misty operation?

671
00:55:37.26 --> 00:55:41.38
What's the chances you're gonna receive enemy fire every time hundred percent hundred percent?

672
00:55:41.38 --> 00:55:43.38
the

673
00:55:43.70 --> 00:55:45.70
Misty day well, we could only do three

674
00:55:46.34 --> 00:55:50.18
Misty missions in a row three of and then you were totally spent

675
00:55:50.54 --> 00:55:56.10
Beat when you say in a row you mean three days in a row three days in a row three and these are four to six hours a piece

676
00:55:56.10 --> 00:55:58.46
Four to six hours. However, you'd wake up

677
00:55:59.18 --> 00:56:05.46
You'd wake up three or four hours ahead of time because you had a long intelligence briefing. What what was going on up there?

678
00:56:06.30 --> 00:56:08.30
What were the other misty's?

679
00:56:08.30 --> 00:56:10.30
reporting truck parks

680
00:56:13.22 --> 00:56:20.10
Butch barge traffic burning trucks whatever we need to be ready up to speed before you went up there and took over

681
00:56:21.50 --> 00:56:26.10
So there was a long there was a long a long intelligence briefing

682
00:56:26.74 --> 00:56:29.86
And then you go out to the airplane. It's still dark

683
00:56:30.70 --> 00:56:34.94
And you get in the F100 you taxi out and using a Vietnam. It's

684
00:56:34.94 --> 00:56:40.90
It's kind of semi foggy maybe a little drizzle kind of an eerie thing

685
00:56:41.42 --> 00:56:48.78
And just before dawn at Fouquette every morning alone F100 with light is after burner

686
00:56:50.18 --> 00:56:53.86
And off into the Merc to North Vietnam and

687
00:56:56.26 --> 00:57:00.02
Every morning I'd hear that that loan F100 take off and wonder

688
00:57:01.14 --> 00:57:03.14
You know what his day was going to be like

689
00:57:03.14 --> 00:57:05.14
And

690
00:57:05.54 --> 00:57:07.54
You go up we had our own tanker

691
00:57:08.22 --> 00:57:12.70
Because if you're low and fast in a jet you're burning fuel and

692
00:57:13.58 --> 00:57:20.14
Since you have your own tanker off the coast, it's just you then you could do multiple refueling and you could still fly your mission

693
00:57:22.30 --> 00:57:25.58
But it was kind of a kind of an eerie solid thing I

694
00:57:26.70 --> 00:57:30.26
Remember going through the chow hall and the Vietnam combat chow hall

695
00:57:30.26 --> 00:57:34.42
well, you've experienced that too powered a powered eggs and

696
00:57:35.42 --> 00:57:39.62
greasy bacon and some some some stuff in the morning chow home

697
00:57:39.74 --> 00:57:45.02
And maybe you would drink in a little bit before the night before and you're running out feeling all that good

698
00:57:45.82 --> 00:57:47.82
and normally

699
00:57:49.30 --> 00:57:53.18
You wouldn't want to you wouldn't want to eat it. I've look at that and I said it skip it, you know

700
00:57:54.22 --> 00:57:56.34
But I stand there and I look at that food

701
00:57:56.34 --> 00:58:03.54
And I think about how terrible it is and then somebody a little voice would come to you and said dick

702
00:58:03.54 --> 00:58:08.82
You better eat this because this may be the last meal you're going to have for a long time

703
00:58:08.82 --> 00:58:14.82
And then with that in mind you sit down there and you whiff it down and gag it down as much as you can

704
00:58:15.10 --> 00:58:20.54
But then it was about a 20 minute flight you go up and you reach on bridge on with your tanker just off the coast of North

705
00:58:20.54 --> 00:58:22.14
Vietnam and

706
00:58:22.14 --> 00:58:27.82
About 20,000 feet you take on your load of fuel and then

707
00:58:28.74 --> 00:58:30.14
this

708
00:58:30.14 --> 00:58:37.70
This experience between the time that combat started that you back off of your tanker and you make that turn and

709
00:58:38.54 --> 00:58:41.42
You start descending out at 20,000 feet now

710
00:58:41.42 --> 00:58:46.26
You're going to penetrate north Vietnamese airspace and you're going to try to do it at a different place each time

711
00:58:46.86 --> 00:58:48.74
Not for the routine

712
00:58:48.74 --> 00:58:55.54
But it was very solemn the air was generally very smooth the most serene thing you could ever see and pretty soon

713
00:58:55.54 --> 00:59:00.78
The coast of Vietnam which is normally kind of farmland and rice paddies and things

714
00:59:01.34 --> 00:59:03.34
Most peaceful thing you've ever said

715
00:59:04.18 --> 00:59:09.74
And as you descended out at 20,000 feet hit the coast at low altitude where our mission was

716
00:59:10.50 --> 00:59:14.74
You check your visor hit your visor down your chin strap on make

717
00:59:14.74 --> 00:59:20.38
doubly sure that all the seat ejection safety pins are pulled out and in your pocket and

718
00:59:20.50 --> 00:59:25.06
Then all of your emitters tied off because you don't want to have a transponder on or a beacon on

719
00:59:25.54 --> 00:59:29.98
And then you set up for the rockets and the mill setting and then you arm the gums

720
00:59:30.70 --> 00:59:32.70
And then you sit there for a handful of minutes

721
00:59:33.66 --> 00:59:35.42
and you think

722
00:59:35.42 --> 00:59:38.46
God I want to know what the next six hours of my life is going to be like

723
00:59:39.18 --> 00:59:41.18
And it's kind of an awesome quiet

724
00:59:41.18 --> 00:59:46.82
Solidude feeling and then you got it pumped up to 550 knots and

725
00:59:47.70 --> 00:59:51.10
then all of a sudden now this is kind of the

726
00:59:52.58 --> 00:59:56.34
Light level was really low because it's just go early in the morning

727
00:59:56.34 --> 00:59:59.14
It's just done. We just want to we don't want to penetrate it Don

728
00:59:59.14 --> 01:00:00.98
Now we're going to be there till noon

729
01:00:00.98 --> 01:00:05.26
But that first time you have this eerie feeling like you know what does the next?

730
01:00:05.26 --> 01:00:11.10
Six hours of my life is going to be like and then all of a sudden all that changes

731
01:00:11.62 --> 01:00:15.02
because the very first gunner on the shoreline sees you and

732
01:00:15.86 --> 01:00:19.46
Every bloody tracer that he fires you can see it really easy

733
01:00:20.10 --> 01:00:25.58
And then there's a lot of guns on the coastline and they know the drill and missies coming

734
01:00:26.62 --> 01:00:32.06
Because we're up here every day and then the whole skies is full of the most beautiful

735
01:00:32.06 --> 01:00:34.06
air

736
01:00:34.06 --> 01:00:36.06
Show you've ever seen this massive

737
01:00:38.30 --> 01:00:40.30
Massive display of

738
01:00:41.34 --> 01:00:42.70
of

739
01:00:42.70 --> 01:00:44.70
Tracers and then you try to find maybe of

740
01:00:45.26 --> 01:00:50.18
They call it I've heard it called the terror and the curtain to make your way to make your way in bond

741
01:00:51.26 --> 01:00:53.62
But then with the very first time

742
01:00:53.62 --> 01:01:01.74
That that first guy opens up at you with the tracers that little gland in my shoulder. I was telling you about ha

743
01:01:02.22 --> 01:01:06.98
It's on it is pumping and then it's frickin combat, baby

744
01:01:07.66 --> 01:01:11.82
And we're going to be there in mortal combat with my fellow men for the next six hours

745
01:01:12.54 --> 01:01:15.86
And I'll tell you what this guy loved every damn second of it

746
01:01:16.22 --> 01:01:17.54
It was a big challenge

747
01:01:17.54 --> 01:01:23.34
You know you kind of hide your trucks and stuff and your war materials to kill our soldiers in the south and we're going to

748
01:01:23.34 --> 01:01:30.06
Frickin find it and I'm going to round up some F4s and some F105s that come down there and bomb it and take you out

749
01:01:30.46 --> 01:01:35.34
And if any of you guys even have the thought of one of your classic

750
01:01:36.06 --> 01:01:43.02
Russian gun sights six position in a circle. They're all classic Soviet with 37 and 57 millimeter

751
01:01:45.18 --> 01:01:49.02
And then there's the other one the 50 cal and the ones at 14

752
01:01:49.02 --> 01:01:54.46
Zip guns and and then there's always the everybody has an AK-47

753
01:01:54.46 --> 01:02:00.30
I mean you fly by especially in the mornings that all the little villages they all look like sparklers and they're all shooting

754
01:02:00.30 --> 01:02:02.02
But they're shooting

755
01:02:02.02 --> 01:02:07.86
You know, we're pulling a lot of G jinking really hard so they can't ever they can't ever aim at us

756
01:02:09.10 --> 01:02:12.86
And every once in a while we'd pick up a small arms round

757
01:02:12.86 --> 01:02:20.42
Very rarely, but then it's the big stuff that would down blow your whole airplane apart

758
01:02:20.82 --> 01:02:27.74
And then it was fights on so are you waiting for the for the fighter bombers to show up before you ingress?

759
01:02:28.34 --> 01:02:32.42
You see there's an air order a battle for the day a frag a call out and

760
01:02:33.18 --> 01:02:35.18
We were assigned

761
01:02:35.42 --> 01:02:36.74
like the

762
01:02:36.74 --> 01:02:41.90
Like the other misdeeds several some other targets that were identified that we need to go up and make strikes on

763
01:02:41.90 --> 01:02:45.26
on that area and then

764
01:02:46.22 --> 01:02:48.94
Just before the day started they were assigned

765
01:02:50.14 --> 01:02:53.34
Your assignment 105s a flight of what if one of fives?

766
01:02:54.70 --> 01:02:56.18
Or a

767
01:02:56.18 --> 01:02:59.18
F4s called the gun fighters with the F4s out of the name

768
01:02:59.78 --> 01:03:05.26
They were assigned to us they'd show up and we run to Vue and I already have the target and I go down and find it

769
01:03:05.82 --> 01:03:07.82
identify it and

770
01:03:07.86 --> 01:03:09.86
Then we'd we'd brief them

771
01:03:09.86 --> 01:03:17.50
You know the altitude the escape routes what the winds were altimeter setting you and that's a brief that you're doing on station

772
01:03:17.50 --> 01:03:19.54
Yeah, when we finally join up with them

773
01:03:19.54 --> 01:03:23.26
Would so would you have to in order to find the target would you have to go down?

774
01:03:23.58 --> 01:03:26.50
Right and look right and that was the big problem

775
01:03:26.50 --> 01:03:32.78
That was mainly why we had a forward air control in North Vietnam because the guys the guys that would come up there

776
01:03:32.78 --> 01:03:36.90
They're not up there all the time and they're high altitude and a lot of times

777
01:03:36.90 --> 01:03:44.22
I find that this is really unfortunate that they would go and drop bombs on villages and stuff

778
01:03:45.30 --> 01:03:49.30
Especially at night. They'd see a little village and they'd bomb the villages and

779
01:03:50.30 --> 01:03:55.30
They'd say and the morning misty they come up and the controllers would say hey

780
01:03:55.30 --> 01:04:00.10
They had a I said the guys were up here last night and we killed 40 trucks on Brown route and

781
01:04:00.86 --> 01:04:04.06
We go over there and there wouldn't be any trucks on Brown route

782
01:04:04.06 --> 01:04:07.34
But there was a village over your burning when we put an end to all that

783
01:04:08.54 --> 01:04:11.66
so that I think that we directed the

784
01:04:12.74 --> 01:04:14.66
airstrikes against

785
01:04:14.66 --> 01:04:19.38
legitimate military targets on the Ho Chi men's trail and that was good and

786
01:04:19.78 --> 01:04:22.38
Sometimes they identified it and they wouldn't have fighters

787
01:04:22.38 --> 01:04:27.10
So they would identify it and then they would brief us the next morning and we'd go up there and find it

788
01:04:27.46 --> 01:04:32.78
Now if you're up there almost every day for six hours you get to know that place like the back of your hand

789
01:04:32.78 --> 01:04:35.50
And especially the gun sights

790
01:04:39.42 --> 01:04:43.10
The gun sights accuracy it varied dramatically

791
01:04:43.86 --> 01:04:48.06
In fact, there was a guy and and Laos he was on an edge of a real rugged car

792
01:04:48.06 --> 01:04:50.54
So he's the 50 caliber we call him the kid on the cars

793
01:04:51.38 --> 01:04:53.98
and every morning we come up and wake him up and

794
01:04:54.86 --> 01:04:59.14
As we'd orbit him he would shoot exactly a hundred and eighty degrees

795
01:04:59.14 --> 01:05:03.82
And he was the worst shot in the world and that always looked at now

796
01:05:03.82 --> 01:05:07.50
How do you get all that ammo up there on this steep cliff and why in the world?

797
01:05:08.10 --> 01:05:12.78
Why in the world when he would he lead us like a hundred and eighty degrees around the circle and

798
01:05:13.38 --> 01:05:15.30
But I'd have a new misty pilot

799
01:05:15.30 --> 01:05:20.38
I said hey, I want to show you what a about a 50 caliber looks like and so we'd fly up there and the kid on the cars

800
01:05:20.38 --> 01:05:26.10
He would fire and they wouldn't you come any close and so forth, but every once in a while some of these gun crews are really good

801
01:05:26.10 --> 01:05:30.02
They would get us

802
01:05:30.78 --> 01:05:37.94
Normally you could see most of the gun sights and if you could see them then you could avoid them or you could not maneuver in such a way

803
01:05:40.74 --> 01:05:44.18
And we'd name we give them names and stuff

804
01:05:45.86 --> 01:05:52.26
That basically if the guy was really good and his camouflage, you know, this is a major Soviet style gun sight

805
01:05:52.26 --> 01:05:55.86
If they were well camouflaged and

806
01:05:56.98 --> 01:06:01.34
We came by and I had my belly up looking at something else and they would fire

807
01:06:02.02 --> 01:06:07.54
And the tracer would come those big 57 caliber of 37 caliber

808
01:06:08.38 --> 01:06:14.10
Things you know as big as a beer can would come by with that with that red tracer

809
01:06:14.10 --> 01:06:22.18
Come by really close and sometimes you can actually hear the shockwaves, you know, like they like a baseball bat

810
01:06:22.66 --> 01:06:25.10
Around your plane then they know that they were really close

811
01:06:25.10 --> 01:06:32.42
And if they were really close and very clever and well camouflaged we freaking had to go back and kill them at least I did

812
01:06:33.34 --> 01:06:35.34
and

813
01:06:35.74 --> 01:06:40.22
One thing the thing about combat if somebody is trying to kill you

814
01:06:40.22 --> 01:06:47.74
And like the bombers and World War two they just have to sit up there and take it they couldn't retaliate against it

815
01:06:47.74 --> 01:06:49.66
But I thought that was really horrible

816
01:06:49.66 --> 01:06:55.14
But the misty had the ability that if you were good and you came really close to me fucker

817
01:06:55.14 --> 01:06:57.14
We're gonna come back and take you out

818
01:06:57.14 --> 01:07:02.82
And so I'd roll back roll back and there'd be a ring around the gun side to be slowly drifting away

819
01:07:02.82 --> 01:07:08.50
And then I'd pull up just out of their range and I think and they knew what the drill was going to be after that

820
01:07:08.50 --> 01:07:12.54
because I need to go out and get some tankers, but I'd come back and

821
01:07:13.62 --> 01:07:18.66
We scrambled the gun fighters out of Da Nang or we have a flight of F105

822
01:07:18.66 --> 01:07:23.46
So we could rob from the guys going downtown Hanoi or something. I says hey I

823
01:07:24.14 --> 01:07:27.58
Got a target for it. It's an extremely aggressive

824
01:07:27.58 --> 01:07:38.10
Aggressive accurate gun sight and I want to take them out. I want you to take them out for me. Oh

825
01:07:38.94 --> 01:07:42.98
Sometimes the misty would try to try to describe where the gun sight was

826
01:07:44.30 --> 01:07:46.86
By talking them into it so I didn't have to mark them

827
01:07:47.50 --> 01:07:51.26
I said, okay guys you see the Gulf of Tonkin out there. Yeah, we see that

828
01:07:51.26 --> 01:07:58.42
It's a big river called the Crankheave River. Okay, follow it up until it has a dog leg beam. You see that

829
01:07:58.54 --> 01:08:03.22
This is okay right at that place and you try to talk on a little road and right off there. There's a field

830
01:08:03.90 --> 01:08:05.90
and if if I tell them

831
01:08:06.42 --> 01:08:11.18
Sometimes I could talk them into like a truck storage area or something and they could get that

832
01:08:11.18 --> 01:08:15.62
But if I'm trying to to talk them into it verbally into a gun sight

833
01:08:16.06 --> 01:08:18.06
They almost never can see it

834
01:08:18.06 --> 01:08:22.34
They say okay, missy. This is your target you freaking mark them man

835
01:08:23.58 --> 01:08:28.42
Now what you have to go to what altitude to get a mark on a on a gun sight

836
01:08:28.82 --> 01:08:33.94
Well, we knew what the range of them of them was and we just climb out of the range of

837
01:08:34.74 --> 01:08:38.62
30 57 was a little higher 37 was a little lower

838
01:08:39.58 --> 01:08:41.50
and it was really interesting because these

839
01:08:42.02 --> 01:08:43.06
these

840
01:08:43.06 --> 01:08:50.26
The shells that would be six position and they'd all open up in the long stream of tracers and they'd float up and they get slower

841
01:08:50.26 --> 01:08:55.18
And slower and slower and finally the tracer would go out and then you couldn't see them anymore

842
01:08:55.18 --> 01:08:59.94
But then they would start down I guess and then they would all self-destruct boom boom boom boom boom

843
01:09:00.50 --> 01:09:05.38
Little puffs of smoke and we try to stay above that and that's what 4,500 feet

844
01:09:05.38 --> 01:09:06.62
Oh, yeah

845
01:09:06.62 --> 01:09:12.66
Four to five thousand feet of memory serves me right and so you're doing your best to fly above that range right?

846
01:09:13.06 --> 01:09:17.14
When you go to mark a target do you have to go into that range or can you mark it from outside?

847
01:09:18.74 --> 01:09:20.94
You got to get in there now they know what the drill is

848
01:09:21.50 --> 01:09:24.86
And it's up to you to put that white phosphorus smoking

849
01:09:25.38 --> 01:09:31.02
Right marking rocket right on top of it and what you want to do is find out what the drift is

850
01:09:31.02 --> 01:09:35.98
So you put the marking rocket just upwind and when the white phosphorus goes off

851
01:09:35.98 --> 01:09:39.58
It it blooms up and hopefully it'll drift over

852
01:09:40.10 --> 01:09:43.86
Drift over the gun so when my first fighter down the chute

853
01:09:43.90 --> 01:09:48.58
He has a better chance because they can't see him now and then he could come in and drop his bombs

854
01:09:51.58 --> 01:09:53.58
But it was

855
01:09:54.18 --> 01:09:56.18
You know as a kid

856
01:09:56.74 --> 01:10:00.46
For the first time you climb up on a high dive hit a swimming pool

857
01:10:00.46 --> 01:10:06.42
And you walk out and all of a sudden this 15 foot looks like 15 miles into the cup

858
01:10:06.42 --> 01:10:08.14
What the hell am I doing here?

859
01:10:08.14 --> 01:10:12.82
And it takes all the courage you have to walk out on the edge of the board and jump off for the first time

860
01:10:13.22 --> 01:10:15.50
And everybody's experienced something like that

861
01:10:18.46 --> 01:10:19.90
It comes up

862
01:10:19.90 --> 01:10:25.58
Finally the miscities circle on them and they shot and they missed the miscities now they know what the drill is and

863
01:10:25.58 --> 01:10:31.14
And they know that if the first thing they do if missy marks them they're dead

864
01:10:31.78 --> 01:10:35.70
And so all their concentration is is to knock the missy out of the sky

865
01:10:37.30 --> 01:10:43.50
And they're all waiting for you and sometimes you'd have to wait because the fighters weren't available then and then

866
01:10:45.22 --> 01:10:47.22
They'd have to go out and refuel or whatever

867
01:10:48.06 --> 01:10:50.06
so you're circling them and

868
01:10:50.06 --> 01:10:57.82
And they know what the drill is and soon as miscies since his wings roll up past vertical

869
01:10:59.14 --> 01:11:01.90
And soon as your past vertical and a nose starts down

870
01:11:02.62 --> 01:11:09.54
Every damn gunner knows that that they got to kill the kid they got to kill the misty because if they get marked or fucked

871
01:11:11.26 --> 01:11:14.14
Now there's a handful of seconds because

872
01:11:14.14 --> 01:11:21.66
There's a thing called lead if you're flying along we could always jank and they would have a hard time tracking us and give us the right lead to hit us

873
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:26.58
But there's about four or five seconds where there's no lead requirement

874
01:11:27.70 --> 01:11:32.42
Because all I have to do is aim right at the missy because he's coming down the chute right at you

875
01:11:32.42 --> 01:11:37.14
There's no lead. There's no lead requirements or anything and there's that handful of seconds

876
01:11:37.82 --> 01:11:40.02
That's when you got your nose at the target

877
01:11:40.02 --> 01:11:45.50
And you got to keep it there for four or five seconds to get your rocket off. Yeah, and it

878
01:11:46.54 --> 01:11:52.10
There's an overwhelming urge to just throw the rocket down there and get away that then you keep thinking

879
01:11:52.82 --> 01:11:58.06
This is important because how I market how accurately if I can use the smoke to blind them

880
01:11:58.06 --> 01:12:01.10
I owe that to the fighters that are coming up there, too

881
01:12:02.10 --> 01:12:06.38
And so it takes a lot of willpower and the nose finally comes down and then they're all shooting

882
01:12:06.38 --> 01:12:10.14
then it's all coming up your way and

883
01:12:11.86 --> 01:12:13.86
And to roll out pull it down

884
01:12:14.62 --> 01:12:19.82
Put the pepper just below the target and then let it ease up and make sure there's no yaw involved in the airplane

885
01:12:19.82 --> 01:12:27.02
And you're not a lot of G because if you're having if you're flying in G the angle of attack will change your marking and it's all that

886
01:12:27.38 --> 01:12:31.14
But it's that handful of seconds and it takes you do you think

887
01:12:31.14 --> 01:12:36.14
It just don't throw this thing out there. It's just like an eternity

888
01:12:37.14 --> 01:12:43.14
And you pull it up and then you stabilize it and then pickle and one's

889
01:12:44.14 --> 01:12:50.14
Smoke rocket comes out now the bad thing is the escape route and once you fired fairly low

890
01:12:51.14 --> 01:12:55.14
That it may be a 30 or 40 degree dive angle and what altitude you're at when you when you fire

891
01:12:55.14 --> 01:13:00.14
1500 feet

892
01:13:00.14 --> 01:13:05.14
Okay, so maybe two thousand fifteen hundred two well within range

893
01:13:05.14 --> 01:13:11.14
Okay, now the worst thing you want to do is you fire the fire though then you pull off straight ahead over the target

894
01:13:11.14 --> 01:13:16.14
You don't want to do that. So once you fire you roll the airplane about 130 degrees to the right and then you pull down into the ground

895
01:13:16.14 --> 01:13:22.14
And you pull down into the ground and you pull down into the ground and you pull down into the ground and you pull down into the ground

896
01:13:22.14 --> 01:13:34.14
And then you pull down into the ground and and what you want to get is a tracking solution that they have to do some type of skill to be able to hit you

897
01:13:34.14 --> 01:13:42.14
Tracking now they've already had this one chance where they don't have to do any the only going to do is aim they don't have to lead you

898
01:13:43.14 --> 01:13:48.14
So you pull to the right and down and roll wings level now you're coming out pretty low

899
01:13:48.14 --> 01:13:55.14
But there's no way they can track you because now there's a big angular velocity and stuff and you're pulling up and when you come back around

900
01:13:55.14 --> 01:14:04.14
You want to look at your smoke and it's either hit my smoke or generally the fighters three or four fighters that are orbiting

901
01:14:04.14 --> 01:14:13.14
There is absolutely no fricking idea no confusion because the whole thing the muzzle flashes just almost light up the world

902
01:14:13.14 --> 01:14:28.14
And then then it's payback time and the misty pulls back up and you say you know hit my smoke and then you pull up around and then lead rolls in

903
01:14:28.14 --> 01:14:35.14
And now they all concentrate on lead coming because he's got to do the same thing coming down the chute of course he can drop his bombs a lot higher

904
01:14:35.14 --> 01:14:40.14
I was going to say can't he drop from maybe six or eight thousand or something like that

905
01:14:40.14 --> 01:14:43.14
So is he out of their range of their weapons?

906
01:14:43.14 --> 01:14:49.14
No by the time they pull out they're probably down within their their lethal range for sure

907
01:14:51.14 --> 01:14:59.14
And now if you're flying around and you see the guy roll in there's no there's no way you can tell because of the angular velocities and stuff

908
01:14:59.14 --> 01:15:09.14
The angles off when he rolls in and drops his bombs now and his stick of bombs come off and he pulls off and then you see in the bombs fall

909
01:15:09.14 --> 01:15:22.14
And then you see these the gun side the muzzle flashes going up at him and they see them and you see them down there shooting like mad

910
01:15:22.14 --> 01:15:30.14
And then you watch the bombs come and they'd see the gun sides the bombs come and then the gratification you get when it hits a dead center

911
01:15:30.14 --> 01:15:43.14
And all of a sudden the most congregation of dirt and nails the gun size and then there's the guns are laying over and all the bunkers are gone and stuff

912
01:15:43.14 --> 01:15:56.14
Sometimes sometimes they miss so what we would do when they would roll in then I would then I would pull up in the opposite direction and make a fake pass at him

913
01:15:56.14 --> 01:16:05.14
And that was to draw fire away from number two and he's coming down the chute and then we just do a crossing maneuver and you may be able to do the same thing for three coming down

914
01:16:05.14 --> 01:16:12.14
To try to try to draw some other fire and there's a handful of minutes that it's pretty exciting

915
01:16:12.14 --> 01:16:19.14
And in a four to six hour mission how many targets would you go after?

916
01:16:19.14 --> 01:16:31.14
It varied a lot depending on the weather sometimes. It's usually a pretty high workload.

917
01:16:31.14 --> 01:16:42.14
If you're not if you're you've had yours assigned targets sometimes all you want to do is drop bombs on a road to do a road cut on the side of a cliff

918
01:16:42.14 --> 01:16:49.14
And try to close the try to close the roads they did a lot of that thinking they were going to close down the Ho Chi Minh trail

919
01:16:49.14 --> 01:16:55.14
We go down there and after news we put in a bunch of strikes and actually have a road slide on a cliff

920
01:16:55.14 --> 01:17:03.14
And I thought boy that shut down the Ho Chi Minh trail for a while we come back at dawn the next morning and the road is fixed

921
01:17:03.14 --> 01:17:11.14
It didn't slow them down at all. The other thing that was really fun is that is that the Navy went out and they mined at some of the rivers

922
01:17:11.14 --> 01:17:26.14
Like the Coyn Key River up there and they were magnetic mines and when a boat comes by it would trigger the magnetism and it would blow up

923
01:17:26.14 --> 01:17:33.14
Well these mines would sit up there and they get more and more and more sensitive and this was just fun I guess

924
01:17:33.14 --> 01:17:46.14
So the first guy down the river first guy in that morning we come real low right down the river going real fast and almost invariably we could trigger off some of those mines behind us

925
01:17:46.14 --> 01:17:52.14
Just to go up and screw them sometimes

926
01:17:52.14 --> 01:18:06.14
Good overview of what you guys were doing up here. Again you profile some of these missions in here. Here's one of them where there's a down pilot

927
01:18:06.14 --> 01:18:13.14
You say down in the jungle is one of our own a fellow fighter pilot a warrior. He was still free and talking on his survival radio

928
01:18:13.14 --> 01:18:21.14
So this guy got shot down and you hear him talking. Our creed was that if you are free and talking we will never give up on your rescue

929
01:18:21.14 --> 01:18:31.14
Force that morning suffered numerous delays and mismanagement before helicopters could be deployed into North Vietnam permission had to be required from some kid in LBJ's White House

930
01:18:31.14 --> 01:18:39.14
It seemed the permission giver was asleep and no one wanted to wake him which caused extensive delays at a time when every second was critical

931
01:18:39.14 --> 01:18:49.14
Frustrations abounded on these on the for those on the rescue team I had flown seven and a half hours the day before and would invest another seven and a half hours before this day was over

932
01:18:49.14 --> 01:18:56.14
With nerves ready to snap this disjointed rescue effort continued and it was already close to noon

933
01:18:56.14 --> 01:19:05.14
My relief Wells Jackson misty to one had just arrived as he was being briefed a call came from search and rescue headquarters in Saigon

934
01:19:05.14 --> 01:19:10.14
Canceling our rescue and instructing us to pull out all forces

935
01:19:10.14 --> 01:19:19.14
I was incensed with this turn of events but the orders had originated from those much higher on the chain of command than I a lowly captain

936
01:19:19.14 --> 01:19:34.14
Then it hit me since I was the only one who could talk directly to Jack the down pilot it was going to be my job to tell him we were giving up and abandoning him to the North Vietnamese for certain torture, imprisonment and possible death

937
01:19:34.14 --> 01:19:42.14
I was infuriated what were they thinking we were American fighting men and we never give up

938
01:19:42.14 --> 01:19:53.14
Enraged I demanded to know who gave the order to pull out turns out it was a general in Saigon who thought it was too risky and it issued the order to withdraw

939
01:19:53.14 --> 01:20:04.14
I thought since that general made the decision to quit that general should be the one to tell scotch 03 that he was to be abandoned

940
01:20:04.14 --> 01:20:17.14
Sleep deprived and furious I ignored any sense of military rank protocol and demanded the general tell me the exact words to use when informing Jack that further rescue attempts were being aborted

941
01:20:17.14 --> 01:20:30.14
While we waited for the exact words I finished briefing my relief misty to one and with a heavy heart left the area knowing we were about to fail one of our own

942
01:20:30.14 --> 01:20:43.14
Back at home base and foo cat it was now close to sunset I sat slouched in the O Club disillusioned that my commanders would could violate our most sacred Cree if you are free and talking we never give up

943
01:20:43.14 --> 01:20:51.14
Alone and heartbroken my only company a couple of empty beer bottles I contemplated my commitment to these high risk missions

944
01:20:51.14 --> 01:21:00.14
It was then that Wells Jackson misty to one burst through the door with a big smile on his face I had to wonder what the hell he was so happy about

945
01:21:00.14 --> 01:21:19.14
Hey routine they got scotch out I could not believe my ears and blurted what Jackson continued yep scotch was rescued seems the general could not come up with the exact words to tell a fellow warrior he was about to be abandoned

946
01:21:19.14 --> 01:21:32.14
Perhaps the general began to realize how such a decision could compromise the long term morale of all of us who fought and died on the Ho Chi Minh trail

947
01:21:32.14 --> 01:21:57.14
That particular mission when they got him out see before that that morning well actually the day before we're up there and there was a flight of F105 not under our control but I could hear him talking that scotch 03 the number three guy in that four ship of F105

948
01:21:57.14 --> 01:22:14.14
They were calling calling and there was no answer so I flew over to the area that they were working and just by a fluke by glint maybe just a second I spotted the orange and white canopy in the top of the jungle

949
01:22:14.14 --> 01:22:31.14
And as I flew up pulled up to come back around it disappeared and but however I memorized the memorize that spot before I took my eyes off of it again so I pulled up and I called and called there was no answer

950
01:22:31.14 --> 01:22:45.14
And so then I pulled up and I did a dive bomb pass where I could talk to him overhead diving right straight at him at that point and I called scotch and he came back and he could hear me and he could talk

951
01:22:45.14 --> 01:22:58.14
Now there's just a handful of seconds that we could exchange exchange information where are you I mean are you okay I have a call they said I have a broken back and I can't move come and get me

952
01:22:58.14 --> 01:23:17.14
Now the sun was just going down and it wasn't enough time to generate a rescue force and so Steve Amdor another fellow Missy and we'd already done a six and a half hour mission and we put scotch asleep that night and told him we'll be back at dawn to get you

953
01:23:17.14 --> 01:23:33.14
And we went back to Denay and landed and tried to organize a rescue force that morning and then we took off about three hours of sleep we took off and just right at dawn the next morning I came across that thing with my afterburner going

954
01:23:33.14 --> 01:23:44.14
And called him and there was no answer so I pulled up back around and I dove at that spot and then I could ask a question he can give me the answer and then we pull off and we'd go away

955
01:23:44.14 --> 01:23:48.14
So that's how we were going to communicate with him

956
01:23:48.14 --> 01:24:08.14
Okay this was this was dawn this faithful day it was long and disjointed rescue in fact they'd shot up two helicopters the helicopter would come in and hover and they found him that night they located him and they set up a flag trap because they knew we were coming back

957
01:24:08.14 --> 01:24:22.14
And every time one of the helicopters would come into a hover Jolly Green and HH3 Air Force helicopter they would shoot and shoot him up pretty bad and they did that to two of them and they got away

958
01:24:22.14 --> 01:24:35.14
There was an A1 Sky Raider that was also working the rescue that morning and he got shot down and for some reason he tried to dead stick it into the Ben High River and he was killed

959
01:24:35.14 --> 01:24:43.14
So we lost two helicopters and we had one A1 shot down and the pilot was killed

960
01:24:43.14 --> 01:24:52.14
The whole morning was disjointed because they had B-52 strikes coming in and they pulled off our rescue forces numerous times and let these big bombers

961
01:24:52.14 --> 01:25:07.14
You know here these guys are 30,000 feet they dropped their bombs before they even go feet dry and to try to hit some targets that were near where we were working so we got pulled off back and forth

962
01:25:07.14 --> 01:25:19.14
So finally the Jolly Greens were trying to come across the border in North Vietnam and they couldn't get approval

963
01:25:19.14 --> 01:25:32.14
And I said something that was probably not very, I said something that wasn't very complimentary about these guys that wouldn't come in and get my guy

964
01:25:32.14 --> 01:25:41.14
Which turned out then I learned about the fact they couldn't because of some snot in those kid in LBJ's White House that had to approve it and nobody wanted to wake him up

965
01:25:41.14 --> 01:25:56.14
And boy then the frustration level was just really high. You know there's targets that we'd have but when you're out there and you're trying to find and rescue one of your own

966
01:25:56.14 --> 01:26:03.14
Then that's totally different, your motivation different. I kept thinking God it could be me down there

967
01:26:03.14 --> 01:26:12.14
And so there was a guy named Don Ingan in an HH3

968
01:26:12.14 --> 01:26:20.14
Now this is after the time that I briefed him and then I says tell me the exact words

969
01:26:20.14 --> 01:26:27.14
If he made a decision to leave this guy to die well then damn it let him tell me the words

970
01:26:27.14 --> 01:26:34.14
You made the decision, you come up with the words to tell him then I down on me hey I'm the only guy that can talk to him

971
01:26:34.14 --> 01:26:40.14
I'm going to have to tell him that I thought screw him I'm not going to come up with my words let the generals words

972
01:26:40.14 --> 01:26:51.14
And then I left with a heavy heart like we said and as it turned out Wells came up and they, the general didn't change his mind

973
01:26:51.14 --> 01:27:02.14
And only this time when Ingan came in and hovered they put the guy's name was the PJ had been in country three days I think

974
01:27:02.14 --> 01:27:13.14
He was a two striper PJ that he was going to be down on the ground and he was there this long enough to hear all the horror stories about being on the ground in North Vietnam

975
01:27:13.14 --> 01:27:22.14
And then he came into a hover and he dropped the PJ down through the jungle to try to find Scott 03

976
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:29.14
And I guess he roamed around and it's all in tape it's incredible tape

977
01:27:29.14 --> 01:27:36.14
And Wells Jackson is talking about a gun sight over there that's trying to lob 37 millimeter into the rescue area

978
01:27:36.14 --> 01:27:49.14
And in Wells backseat he has a photographer that went along with him that day and the guy was six hours and he was throwing up continuously

979
01:27:49.14 --> 01:28:00.14
And over the interphone they could hear the kid throwing up but he came into a hover anyway Cali Sergeant Herman Cali

980
01:28:00.14 --> 01:28:02.14
That's the PJ

981
01:28:02.14 --> 01:28:08.14
It's on the ground and he finally found he roamed around and found him

982
01:28:08.14 --> 01:28:14.14
And then now he had the vector of the Jolly Green ore and now it's all very quiet there's no ground fire or anything

983
01:28:14.14 --> 01:28:21.14
And he says forward forward forward it's okay it's good drop the thoughts of penetrator it's a long cable with a special peep

984
01:28:21.14 --> 01:28:27.14
You know what it is a penetrator device kind of like a bullet that can go down through the jungle

985
01:28:27.14 --> 01:28:35.14
And it goes down and Sergeant Talie or Herman Talie puts Scott 03 on the penetrator

986
01:28:35.14 --> 01:28:40.14
And then everything's flat you know the guy sitting there in the nice hover Ingan

987
01:28:40.14 --> 01:28:47.14
Ingan is a Coast Guard exchange pilot it's not an Air Force pilot Coast Guard pilot

988
01:28:47.14 --> 01:28:56.14
And they said okay and then Talie on the ground has a little radio and he says okay I got him you know pull me up

989
01:28:56.14 --> 01:29:03.14
And then there's a handful of seconds and you can just imagine he's sitting there in the hover and the cable's coming up also slowly

990
01:29:03.14 --> 01:29:09.14
And I don't know how high it was it may have been 30, 40 maybe 50 feet in the sky

991
01:29:09.14 --> 01:29:12.14
And then they activated the trap

992
01:29:12.14 --> 01:29:18.14
Now they knew this time that the Jolly wasn't going any place he was hooked

993
01:29:18.14 --> 01:29:21.14
You know the other guys weren't hooked they just get away

994
01:29:21.14 --> 01:29:27.14
But they knew that the Jolly they had the choice of either cutting the cable and leaving

995
01:29:27.14 --> 01:29:33.14
And Ingan said later it says guy how could you sit there under that withering fire

996
01:29:33.14 --> 01:29:39.14
And he says there was no way I would ever leave one my PJ on the ground

997
01:29:39.14 --> 01:29:44.14
God I mean that was just his mindset an incredible person

998
01:29:44.14 --> 01:29:50.14
And this cable come up and Talie would squeeze the mic button on his little radio and he's been screaming

999
01:29:50.14 --> 01:29:57.14
Ground fire ground fire take it out take it out ground thin in the background you can hear intense automatic weapons fire

1000
01:29:57.14 --> 01:30:05.14
And Talie told it later he looked up at the Jolly and it was being from all different directions being shot to crap

1001
01:30:05.14 --> 01:30:11.14
I mean the windshield was being blown out there was hydraulic fluid leaking the one of the landing gear that just plopped out

1002
01:30:11.14 --> 01:30:17.14
And there was punchers of fuel pouring down and pieces falling down off the airplane

1003
01:30:17.14 --> 01:30:26.14
And later on I asked Talie I says this is what a great thing you know to save the helicopter you know you'd sacrifice yourself to do that

1004
01:30:26.14 --> 01:30:34.14
And he looked at me you know typical boy this kid he looked at me says oh no no sir it wasn't that at all

1005
01:30:34.14 --> 01:30:39.14
He says I looked up and I didn't want the damn thing falling on me

1006
01:30:39.14 --> 01:30:48.14
Anyway Angon he was awarded the Air Force Cross but it should have been a Medal of Honor

1007
01:30:48.14 --> 01:30:54.14
And even today I'm still trying to work that out especially since I found out that an entire Vietnam War

1008
01:30:54.14 --> 01:31:02.14
That all the contributions that the Marines I'm sorry not the Marines but the Coast Guard this guy was a Coast Guard exchange pilot

1009
01:31:02.14 --> 01:31:09.14
That whole war and all the participation by the Coast Guard in that war there was not one Medal of Honor winner

1010
01:31:09.14 --> 01:31:16.14
And I thought that's really a shame and even today I'm signed to the right letters and trying to get that thing upgraded

1011
01:31:16.14 --> 01:31:24.14
Because I think it would be important that the contribution of the Coast Guard should be recognized by one of their heroes and Angon to do that

1012
01:31:24.14 --> 01:31:37.14
Anyway they got him above the jungle canopy and then he translated away and it was just a few miles and he just crossed the Ben Hai River

1013
01:31:37.14 --> 01:31:46.14
There was a medevac there called the Rockpile and they landed and I don't think the Jolly ever flew again it was shot up so bad

1014
01:31:46.14 --> 01:32:05.14
Man we got another situation in the book and in this one you're flying and there's another plane another Saber that's on fire

1015
01:32:05.14 --> 01:32:13.14
And there's a general you don't know this at the time but there's actually a general in the front seat

1016
01:32:13.14 --> 01:32:21.14
Yeah this is another RF4C you know same thing that Lee was flying except that was a reconnaissance for it

1017
01:32:21.14 --> 01:32:24.14
It was a recce version of the Phantom

1018
01:32:24.14 --> 01:32:35.14
And so this guy their call sign is strobe 1-0 and so you're flying next to him you see that they're on fire

1019
01:32:35.14 --> 01:32:46.14
And you tell them hey you're on fire and going to the book here it says strobe 1-0 acknowledged our call that he was on fire and stated we're bailing out

1020
01:32:46.14 --> 01:32:56.14
This should have been a standard ejection they were flying at 10,000 feet straight level at an ideal speed of about 230 knots everything was set for routine ejection and water rescue

1021
01:32:56.14 --> 01:33:03.14
Which is interesting that you're talking about a routine ejection and water rescue that shows your mentality

1022
01:33:03.14 --> 01:33:13.14
I had never seen an ejection up close the notoriously complicated F4 Martin Baker seat known as the back breaker would be something to witness

1023
01:33:13.14 --> 01:33:21.14
I eased the old hun to route formation about 30 feet out on his left wing and waited for what seemed an eternity nothing happened

1024
01:33:21.14 --> 01:33:30.14
Almost two minutes dragged by before the rear seat finally ejected later on I asked the back seat of what had taken so long they knew they were on fire

1025
01:33:30.14 --> 01:33:35.14
He said that they had taken out the checklist and reviewed the ejection procedures

1026
01:33:35.14 --> 01:33:42.14
The general did not want to eject they argued about the position of the command ejection handle in the rear cockpit

1027
01:33:42.14 --> 01:33:52.14
The major upholding his duties wanted it in the command eject position where the guy in the back ejects the front seat pilot

1028
01:33:52.14 --> 01:34:00.14
However the general insisted that it be left in the off position thereby making each seat a single initiated ejection

1029
01:34:00.14 --> 01:34:08.14
The major reluctantly sat up straight grabbed the yellow handle between his legs and pulled leaving the general to his fate

1030
01:34:08.14 --> 01:34:13.14
From my vantage point the rear cockpit ejection was textbook and I remember it vividly

1031
01:34:13.14 --> 01:34:18.14
The aft canopy opened and separated cleanly clearing the tail by at least 20 feet

1032
01:34:18.14 --> 01:34:25.14
The rear seat started up the rails as the bottom of the seat cleared the cockpit the rocket motor ignited burn for 1.2 seconds

1033
01:34:25.14 --> 01:34:34.14
And the seat went straight up very stable when the rocket stopped the small drogue parachute released and the seat rotated backward 90 degrees as it cleared the tail

1034
01:34:34.14 --> 01:34:43.14
Looking over my right shoulder I could see the main C9 parachute canopy had also deployed as it started to open the seat separated from the back seat pilot and kept right on going

1035
01:34:43.14 --> 01:34:51.14
With the canopy fully open the pilot swung back underneath I thought the whole thing was neat as hell until I looked back at the stricken aircraft

1036
01:34:51.14 --> 01:34:58.14
What I was about to witness was chilling it would leave an indelible imprint which remains surreal and unforgettable to this day

1037
01:34:58.14 --> 01:35:03.14
I was horrified to see the front cockpit totally engulfed in fire

1038
01:35:03.14 --> 01:35:08.14
I saw an occasional flash from a white helmet that was barely visible through the smoke and flames

1039
01:35:08.14 --> 01:35:14.14
The general was sitting straight up as before but motionless he seemed oblivious to his circumstances

1040
01:35:14.14 --> 01:35:24.14
Huge flames that resembled giant blow torches streamed from the rubber petal, rudder petal area at his feet through the cockpit around him

1041
01:35:24.14 --> 01:35:34.14
And out through the now open rear cockpit the fire had filled the phantom's interior and produced a dense black smoke trail that obscured the tail

1042
01:35:34.14 --> 01:35:42.14
Strangely the aircraft flew on, terrified I thought the general must not be aware of the fire so I began to holler over the radio

1043
01:35:42.14 --> 01:35:45.14
Strobe 1-0 bail out bail out

1044
01:35:45.14 --> 01:35:50.14
I continued to scream desperately but the general just sat there doing nothing

1045
01:35:50.14 --> 01:35:54.14
The wings remained level and the aircraft now began a shallow descent

1046
01:35:54.14 --> 01:35:59.14
My god I screamed why doesn't he eject how can you just sit there what the hell is wrong

1047
01:35:59.14 --> 01:36:07.14
Then I figured it out maybe he couldn't hear me I was too far away 30 feet so I drove the hunt right up next to the burning cockpit and screamed again

1048
01:36:07.14 --> 01:36:10.14
Strobe 1-0 bail out bail out

1049
01:36:10.14 --> 01:36:14.14
Then Harland yelled oh my god look at it burn

1050
01:36:14.14 --> 01:36:21.14
Frustrated in half in shock I wanted it just transpired not 10 feet from us we moved in closer

1051
01:36:21.14 --> 01:36:27.14
So close the air pressure between the two aircraft caused the fiery phantom to roll up into a right bank

1052
01:36:27.14 --> 01:36:36.14
As I pulled back the F-4 turned 90 degrees rolled back wings level and pointed itself directly at the beach in a slightly steeper descent

1053
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:42.14
By then we could no longer see the general's white helmet only a blackened charred canopy

1054
01:36:42.14 --> 01:36:52.14
The paint on the entire nose was burned and blistered there were a couple of small explosions in the nose area that blew some of the panels loose and sent other pieces flying off the plane

1055
01:36:52.14 --> 01:37:02.14
The entire front front end was a charcoal colored mass the orange and yellow flames subsided their dense smoke streaming backward over the fuselage

1056
01:37:02.14 --> 01:37:10.14
For some unfathomable reason I continued to call Strobe 1-0 begging him to get out even though it was obviously futile

1057
01:37:10.14 --> 01:37:18.14
We stayed close on his wing and at 500 feet the old phantom gave one last gas pitched up a little then dove straight into the beach and exploded

1058
01:37:18.14 --> 01:37:23.14
I just couldn't let go Harlan screamed god damn it dick pull up

1059
01:37:23.14 --> 01:37:29.14
I know Harlan's stern direction was the wake-up call that saved us I might very well have crashed right beside Strobe

1060
01:37:29.14 --> 01:37:37.14
I pulled up hard barely missing some small trees behind the beach pulling off to the left and in a choking voice I told Waterboy

1061
01:37:37.14 --> 01:37:40.14
Strobe 1-0 just impacted on the beach

1062
01:37:40.14 --> 01:37:45.14
Moments later Waterboy asked whether there was any chance of survival

1063
01:37:45.14 --> 01:37:51.14
My plaintive reply was negative survival, negative survival

1064
01:38:01.14 --> 01:38:07.14
Now there's a you have to kind of go and debrief this situation and there was a tape

1065
01:38:07.14 --> 01:38:10.14
There's a tape of this whole thing there was

1066
01:38:10.14 --> 01:38:15.14
And there's something that you talk about in here you there's something that you edited out of the tape

1067
01:38:15.14 --> 01:38:18.14
Was it some words between you and the general what was it?

1068
01:38:23.14 --> 01:38:30.14
Let me back up a second that was remember the Nixon he had an 18 minute gap

1069
01:38:30.14 --> 01:38:33.14
I had an 18 second gap

1070
01:38:33.14 --> 01:38:44.14
First of all these were these were extremely high-risk missions that these guys flew the recce missions they were 500 feet and they were straight and level

1071
01:38:44.14 --> 01:38:52.14
And they would come up and we would check in and they had their certain coordinates for departure and their routes and stuff

1072
01:38:52.14 --> 01:39:00.14
And the misdeed they would check in with us and then we would help them identify it sometimes they needed some help identifying stuff

1073
01:39:00.14 --> 01:39:11.14
And so I would stay up above these guys and watch them watch them with their you know their photo run straight and level just getting shot up like mad

1074
01:39:11.14 --> 01:39:15.14
Flying straight and level up there it's almost a kiss of death at 500 feet

1075
01:39:15.14 --> 01:39:22.14
Yeah you just never want to do that up there to fly straight and level I would never fly straight and level the misdeeds had four or five G's on us all the time

1076
01:39:22.14 --> 01:39:29.14
Jinking like mad so nobody could really predict where we were going to be that's the only thing that we could survive at all

1077
01:39:29.14 --> 01:39:36.14
But the one thing that I did know is that these were extremely high-risk missions in North into North Vietnam by the reconnaissance guys

1078
01:39:36.14 --> 01:39:41.14
And they were flown by lieutenants and captains just like me

1079
01:39:41.14 --> 01:39:48.14
The company great or the field grade and would never be a general officer

1080
01:39:48.14 --> 01:40:01.14
So I had just come off the tanker heading into North Vietnam and I heard the call that we had taken a hit just north of a case on I think

1081
01:40:01.14 --> 01:40:12.14
And we're coming out feet wet to get feet wet and so I says wow okay well I'm just coming out and they're coming they're coming out and we're coming back in so I joined up with them

1082
01:40:12.14 --> 01:40:20.14
Now my perception was that I was talking to the front seater and the front seater was a captain just like me right

1083
01:40:20.14 --> 01:40:29.14
I had no idea it was a dental officer I had no idea that I was talking to a C&I major the majors was take care of this general in the back seat

1084
01:40:29.14 --> 01:40:38.14
So my conversations my perception was that I was talking to a fellow captain that was sitting in the front cockpit and that wasn't the case

1085
01:40:38.14 --> 01:40:49.14
So we joined up with him and looked him over he looked pretty good and we had to get real close up underneath him we could see there was a little bit of fire going on up in the camera bay

1086
01:40:49.14 --> 01:41:01.14
Nothing, nothing bad they were complaining about losing I think they lost a utility hydraulic system and it was getting really hot but that was all

1087
01:41:01.14 --> 01:41:11.14
And I think the general was up in the north Vietnam where he bloody well shouldn't have been but it was his last mission it was his champagne flight he was going to go home

1088
01:41:11.14 --> 01:41:19.14
And he wanted, it told me that he could get an extra air medal if he flew into north Vietnam which he wasn't supposed to

1089
01:41:19.14 --> 01:41:32.14
So this general Bob Warley fighter pilot a good really a good guy he wanted to go up there and on his last mission and bring back some good information good photography and stuff

1090
01:41:32.14 --> 01:41:45.14
And so all of a sudden well we joined up with him he was about I don't know 10 miles feet wet head and south towards the name

1091
01:41:45.14 --> 01:41:54.14
And we saw the little fire and I was having a conversation with a fellow captain not knowing that it was a general

1092
01:41:54.14 --> 01:42:07.14
And so we told him that they were on fire or had a fire up in the nose and we pulled off like you said like you've read in the book in the route formation around his wing

1093
01:42:07.14 --> 01:42:22.14
And they took a lot longer than I thought to go ahead and I found out later that they were arguing about now the general was sitting I don't think the general really knew that there was anything really bad enough that they should eject

1094
01:42:22.14 --> 01:42:32.14
That's why the argument was and I'm sure that he says okay I'm going to get rid of this guy in the back and I'm going to fly this airplane back and save it because

1095
01:42:32.14 --> 01:42:38.14
You know if I lose the airplane and they find out I was screwing around in North Vietnam they're going to really frown at me

1096
01:42:38.14 --> 01:42:46.14
And I think that was his motivation to get rid of the guy in the back and then he could be the hero and fly the airplane back

1097
01:42:46.14 --> 01:42:52.14
Which wasn't the case the problem on the F-4 Phantom was you can't get rid of the canopy

1098
01:42:52.14 --> 01:43:02.14
It has a pneumatic plunger that has to push the leading edge up or else the normal wind speed clamps it down

1099
01:43:02.14 --> 01:43:11.14
You just can't unlock it because it won't go any place you have to have these plungers and I think when they got hit in the nose that plunger was damaged

1100
01:43:11.14 --> 01:43:21.14
And so he didn't know it at the time but the only way he could live was to get the airplane back because this injection system without the canopy gone you can't eject through it

1101
01:43:21.14 --> 01:43:34.14
It's one of the Martin Baker things. So that was in his mind. So when they finally decided to go ahead and eject the fire hit him and he wasn't

1102
01:43:34.14 --> 01:43:43.14
I'm sure he wasn't ready for that. Now my conversation the whole time was with that guy in the white helmet in that fire

1103
01:43:43.14 --> 01:43:50.14
That was the conversation we had. Had no idea that the guy was talking to us hanging in a parachute a couple miles behind us

1104
01:43:50.14 --> 01:44:00.14
So that was my mindset. But I often thought about what I was saying what I was seeing and what my reaction to that was

1105
01:44:00.14 --> 01:44:16.14
It says why did I say well maybe he can't hear me. You know how absurd this is. Hey hey deckhand I didn't notice this fire that the whole cockpit was on fire

1106
01:44:16.14 --> 01:44:24.14
I'm sure glad you told me about that. Now I'm just going to go ahead and eject. Hey appreciate you telling me that I'm fricking on firing a cockpit's full

1107
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:30.14
So you're sitting there and you got to do something. I just

1108
01:44:30.14 --> 01:44:36.14
And so I called him you know strolling one bail out bail out screaming out of the bail out

1109
01:44:36.14 --> 01:44:44.14
And then I says well maybe he can't hear me. I mean how stupid is that. What do you mean. The difference between 30 feet

1110
01:44:44.14 --> 01:44:53.14
That he can hear me on a UHF radio that I transmit for hundreds of miles. I mean it's just absurd that you know the psychology of that and what hit you all of a sudden

1111
01:44:53.14 --> 01:45:05.14
And then I drove in so hard that their pressure turned him. Otherwise he would have crashed in the golf of Tonkha and this way he crashed right on the beach

1112
01:45:05.14 --> 01:45:13.14
And not wanting to let go and almost crashing right beside him

1113
01:45:13.14 --> 01:45:24.14
You know we pulled up and the water boy was the the controlling agency the one that controls us in and out of the pack and BDA and

1114
01:45:24.14 --> 01:45:33.14
Organizes fighter strikes and stuff that was our controller and then all of a sudden since he blew up now I'd seen a lot of airplanes crash

1115
01:45:33.14 --> 01:45:39.14
And it wasn't unusual to see another airplane you know a combat loss I'd seen those before

1116
01:45:39.14 --> 01:45:48.14
And it was always like okay well okay another one another combat loss and we're righted off and the war goes on

1117
01:45:48.14 --> 01:45:55.14
But as we were pulling up off to the left they wanted to know survival and I said negative survival

1118
01:45:55.14 --> 01:46:00.14
And then all of a sudden there was a whole bunch of interest in this crash site

1119
01:46:00.14 --> 01:46:07.14
They wanted security up there and they wanted to get medivacs and they're going to deploy a whole bunch of stuff and I don't know what the hell is going on

1120
01:46:07.14 --> 01:46:13.14
That's not strange airplane crashes combat loss the war goes on

1121
01:46:13.14 --> 01:46:19.14
So we went back we went back and found the the backseater hanging in the parachute

1122
01:46:19.14 --> 01:46:24.14
Only this time the wind was really strong and the golf of Tonkha and then it was really rough

1123
01:46:24.14 --> 01:46:32.14
Now we're down in South Vietnam south of the border so the sandpan that was coming out was coming out from the south

1124
01:46:32.14 --> 01:46:38.14
And it was a motorized sandpan and it was really rough and he was bouncing

1125
01:46:38.14 --> 01:46:40.14
So this is now a race between?

1126
01:46:40.14 --> 01:46:50.14
Well the guys hanging in the parachute and see normally you can get killed on somebody out there screwing around

1127
01:46:50.14 --> 01:46:56.14
They don't know what to do now everybody's trained the jolly comes in and they know what to do and how to take care of the parachute

1128
01:46:56.14 --> 01:47:04.14
You know all those issues you need to get to get you out of the water into a rescue craft

1129
01:47:04.14 --> 01:47:09.14
And then there's certain training Dave you move into all that many times soon

1130
01:47:09.14 --> 01:47:17.14
So all of a sudden we see this this motorized junk and we looked we look at it and it's what's a sandpan on a junk motorized

1131
01:47:17.14 --> 01:47:22.14
And he's booking it he's going and he can see the guy hanging in the parachute and he's going out there

1132
01:47:22.14 --> 01:47:33.14
So he go by and it has the south Vietnamese flag on it and I mean in that war that doesn't mean square root of Foxtrot Alpha what the flag is

1133
01:47:33.14 --> 01:47:41.14
And so Harlan that I talked about he was in the front seat he was my student that day and I was instructor in the back during this whole thing

1134
01:47:41.14 --> 01:47:48.14
And so I look at him and I says well we can't let that guy get back to the pilot

1135
01:47:48.14 --> 01:47:53.14
And I said okay well go ahead and go ahead and kill him

1136
01:47:53.14 --> 01:48:01.14
And so Harlan armed a guy and he came back as we're turning on final I'm thinking you know maybe he is a south Vietnamese

1137
01:48:01.14 --> 01:48:07.14
And why don't we just scare him so he did a low pass by and he just kept going

1138
01:48:07.14 --> 01:48:13.14
And so I says okay well he's got the message and now we'll just go ahead and shoot him

1139
01:48:13.14 --> 01:48:21.14
And as we turn final the second time I had second thoughts and I says well Harlan why don't we put some 20 millimeter right across his bow

1140
01:48:21.14 --> 01:48:32.14
Okay so Harlan did he rolled in and he put a stick of you know run a strafe across his bow

1141
01:48:32.14 --> 01:48:39.14
Now it was really neat he was going up I said no no no no his strafe went right in front of him and he goes whoop

1142
01:48:39.14 --> 01:48:48.14
Boom boom boom boom boom boom and then he beat back beat feet back to the store and then the Jolly Green finally came in and rescued him after that

1143
01:48:48.14 --> 01:48:55.14
Now we flew back to Phuket. No I went about another three hour mission that day and I didn't get back until noon

1144
01:48:55.14 --> 01:49:04.14
And so we pulled into Phuket and I noticed that there was every colonel in the whole base was Erdemitas

1145
01:49:04.14 --> 01:49:12.14
And I told Harlan I says hey I says I don't know what we did but it must have been a major fuck up

1146
01:49:12.14 --> 01:49:18.14
I couldn't remember that I did anything really bad but what were these damn colonels here for

1147
01:49:18.14 --> 01:49:26.14
And so we opened the canopy and the first colonel up the stairs says what are you doing here you're supposed to be in Saigon

1148
01:49:26.14 --> 01:49:32.14
You're supposed to be in Saigon what are you landing you're not supposed to land here is this all mad at me

1149
01:49:32.14 --> 01:49:39.14
And then I told Harlan over the interphone I says Harlan I don't know what it is but it's worse than what I thought

1150
01:49:39.14 --> 01:49:46.14
And then the guy finally found out that they realized he says oh you don't know who was in that airplane do you

1151
01:49:46.14 --> 01:49:54.14
I thought you know a wrecky guy fellow captain that you know I said that's really a shame that should have seen a lot of stuff

1152
01:49:54.14 --> 01:50:00.14
And he says oh my god you didn't know that it was General Warley in that airplane

1153
01:50:00.14 --> 01:50:08.14
Now everything all made sense and he says oh yeah by the way I got it all on tape

1154
01:50:08.14 --> 01:50:16.14
Because when he hired Mayday I started the little tape recorder that we Jerry rigged we bought it at the hardware store

1155
01:50:16.14 --> 01:50:22.14
And I Jerry rigged a plug that whatever I went into my headset that I could record it under little cassettes

1156
01:50:22.14 --> 01:50:26.14
That was just kind of my idea

1157
01:50:26.14 --> 01:50:31.14
So I handed it to him and the colonel took it and said you got it all on tape wow and he was holding it

1158
01:50:31.14 --> 01:50:34.14
And he didn't know what to do with it so he gave it back to me

1159
01:50:34.14 --> 01:50:42.14
And he says go get a class B uniform on there's going to be a T-39 scat back to bring you down

1160
01:50:42.14 --> 01:50:46.14
There's some generals that want to talk to you down in Saigon holy frick

1161
01:50:46.14 --> 01:50:53.14
The last thing in the world that this little up country pog pilot wanted to do was hanging around with four star generals

1162
01:50:53.14 --> 01:50:58.14
How many generals that you talked to at this point and you're deployed to Vietnam?

1163
01:50:58.14 --> 01:51:01.14
General I'm a little pove captaincy

1164
01:51:01.14 --> 01:51:06.14
So anyway the T-39 come up and picked us up and on our way down to Saigon

1165
01:51:06.14 --> 01:51:11.14
I thought you know I had to listen to this tape and so I played it

1166
01:51:11.14 --> 01:51:15.14
And there was something in there that was extremely inappropriate

1167
01:51:15.14 --> 01:51:18.14
Just language wise?

1168
01:51:18.14 --> 01:51:23.14
Harlan is dead and I'll take that what I said to the great

1169
01:51:23.14 --> 01:51:25.14
Fair enough

1170
01:51:25.14 --> 01:51:34.14
So I recorded it over it and it was exactly 18 seconds long just like Nixon's 18 minute tape

1171
01:51:34.14 --> 01:51:43.14
And it's a damn good thing too that I took that out of there because every one of those damn generals wanted his own personal private briefing

1172
01:51:43.14 --> 01:51:51.14
And so I had to play it over and over and over again and I'm thinking God I'm so glad that I raised that

1173
01:51:51.14 --> 01:51:56.14
It was a shame too

1174
01:51:56.14 --> 01:52:04.14
Along with that there was his he had two daughters General Worley good guy fighter pilot

1175
01:52:04.14 --> 01:52:11.14
And they call me some years later and they wanted to go down and they wanted to go to Vietnam where where their father had died

1176
01:52:11.14 --> 01:52:16.14
And nobody could tell them where it was the exact location

1177
01:52:16.14 --> 01:52:26.14
But I thought these two ladies they need to go to the to an exact spot out there to build a memorial and have closure right where their dad died

1178
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:34.14
Now I tried to drag it out of my memory and describe exactly you know turn left here in this little town called Phuk Noi

1179
01:52:34.14 --> 01:52:39.14
And you go to the beach and you turn left and you go a hundred yards and that's where he crashed

1180
01:52:39.14 --> 01:52:43.14
Well it turned out it was a hundred yards the other direction

1181
01:52:43.14 --> 01:52:52.14
But it didn't matter because they went there and they sent me a picture of a memorial and they were hugging each other and it was kind of a closure

1182
01:52:52.14 --> 01:52:55.14
It was a nice thing for him

1183
01:52:55.14 --> 01:53:03.14
Now you got another thing that you write about in the book you write about your friend Howie Howard K Williams

1184
01:53:03.14 --> 01:53:11.14
What happened with him and what was this this mystery phone call that you got can you talk us through that

1185
01:53:11.14 --> 01:53:23.14
Yeah the miscies we were we were kind of a unique group we were doing some highly classified stuff and we were separated from most of the

1186
01:53:23.14 --> 01:53:35.14
In-country fighter pilots that flew those toothpick monkey deaf making monkeys deaf missions in South Vietnam

1187
01:53:35.14 --> 01:53:41.14
And sometimes we'd fly those missions and there was troops in contact and there was a lot going on

1188
01:53:41.14 --> 01:53:48.14
And we'd go in there roll in brought my bombs and leave and I'd think hey there's a combat down there you know I wanted to be part of it

1189
01:53:48.14 --> 01:53:51.14
What happened I mean who's in combat I want to know the details of that

1190
01:53:51.14 --> 01:53:59.14
And I just didn't want to climb you know fly back my airplane not knowing about it that's why I wanted to go to MISTI

1191
01:53:59.14 --> 01:54:08.14
And I found out about MISTI and I says hey I want to go there and it's a volunteer thing and that guy says no one of the requirements is you have to be a flight lead

1192
01:54:08.14 --> 01:54:15.14
And I says okay well I want to go to MISTI I kept bugging my commander the squadron commander

1193
01:54:15.14 --> 01:54:27.14
And he says no damn it routine you're a newbie pilot here and you'll be six or eight months four to six months before you can even think about checking out as a flight lead

1194
01:54:27.14 --> 01:54:33.14
So I kept bugging him and bugging him and bugging him and he finally just got pissed off and he says okay god damn it

1195
01:54:33.14 --> 01:54:38.14
I'll give you a flight lead check which I was no more qualified or experienced or anything

1196
01:54:38.14 --> 01:54:45.14
And so I went out and I didn't do a very good job as a flight lead

1197
01:54:45.14 --> 01:54:56.14
In fact I think I got hit on that and in country yeah an in country hit was very rare getting hit from in country the biggest thing they have it may be a 50 caliber

1198
01:54:56.14 --> 01:55:06.14
And they hit it in the gun bay and as an example I screw it up I mean here's the target right we're going to go in I've got a flight of four

1199
01:55:06.14 --> 01:55:11.14
And the wind is blowing so what does I do?

1200
01:55:11.14 --> 01:55:18.14
Little dick trying to be a flight lead he chooses you know there's three targets down there as an example

1201
01:55:18.14 --> 01:55:29.14
And so what I do I try I go and attack the target that's upwind so if it's upwind there's a bunch of smoke and the smoke drifts over all the other ones that they have to hit

1202
01:55:29.14 --> 01:55:41.14
You know a classy newbie screw up and so the commander says god damn it dick if you want to go to Missy then you can go get the hell out of here I want to see you again

1203
01:55:41.14 --> 01:55:51.14
And so then I enjoyed this these classified guys that had our own air conditioned little trailers out in our own little condominium

1204
01:55:51.14 --> 01:56:03.14
And that's the tip of the spear and if that's where the action was and that's where Dickie wanted to be boy that was so so happy and in fraud with that

1205
01:56:03.14 --> 01:56:08.14
That's why I stayed to do a second tour to do actually a hundred missions in Missy

1206
01:56:08.14 --> 01:56:17.14
So then I went up and what I saw in the north Vietnam and the areas that we were it was a different world

1207
01:56:17.14 --> 01:56:30.14
And there was a lot of a lot of ground fire and a lot of a lot of targets that had been hit and we went back 35 years later

1208
01:56:30.14 --> 01:56:44.14
I went back with five guys that I flew combat with and I wanted to go back to that area we call it the root packs and the north Vietnam is often about six different areas

1209
01:56:44.14 --> 01:56:59.14
You know two of them the Navy has and then there's the ones up around Hanoi and we were one of the ones down in the southern Panhandle just above the DMC is called root pack one

1210
01:56:59.14 --> 01:57:08.14
So that was that was our that was our primary area that we flew in all the time

1211
01:57:08.14 --> 01:57:12.14
And I don't know where was I going with that

1212
01:57:12.14 --> 01:57:16.14
Well I was trying to I was trying to get to the what happened with Howie

1213
01:57:16.14 --> 01:57:25.14
Oh with Howie. Okay this is now Howie was our I'm sorry getting old and gray beard

1214
01:57:25.14 --> 01:57:38.14
Howie was the top gun in our gun school he was really good he was a fighter pilots fighter pilot man had a cute little blonde wife couple of little kids this he was a cool guy

1215
01:57:38.14 --> 01:57:49.14
Anyway he had it during gunner gunnery school he had an engine failure and he ejected in gunnery school and when he got back he says well you know how did it go

1216
01:57:49.14 --> 01:58:00.14
You know why he ejected you know what happened everybody wants to know and he says well the only thing that happened is he says it jarred my he came back and he says his glasses were a jar

1217
01:58:00.14 --> 01:58:03.14
His sunglasses were a jar that's his only issue

1218
01:58:03.14 --> 01:58:09.14
It's when I'm up in MISTI I think it's cool as it gets huh? Yeah it's cool as it gets

1219
01:58:09.14 --> 01:58:16.14
So it's just Howie you got to come up to MISTI man this is where the action is now he didn't want to go

1220
01:58:16.14 --> 01:58:32.14
And then I was so excited about what we were doing and he's our top gun guy and I don't think he was as had the adrenaline or that little combat gland as bad as I did

1221
01:58:32.14 --> 01:58:45.14
And he finally acquiesced and he joined MISTI and on his first check out ride he basically got killed

1222
01:58:45.14 --> 01:58:59.14
Him and Brian Williams, Howard Williams and Brian Williams they were in an area called Chippon the very hot area up in Laos and sure enough they got hit on fire

1223
01:58:59.14 --> 01:59:10.14
And Brian says the fire was burning from the engine compartment all the way almost all the way into the back cockpit and they said

1224
01:59:10.14 --> 01:59:20.14
He says okay we're going to have to get out so they headed out a remote area in the jungle to eject and he says

1225
01:59:20.14 --> 01:59:29.14
Brian says okay I'm going to go and Howard says okay I'm right behind you that's last words he ever said

1226
01:59:29.14 --> 01:59:40.14
And Brian and I was up there flying another MISTI story and I heard this and went tearing over there and the Jolly Grain was real close and they picked him up

1227
01:59:40.14 --> 01:59:50.14
Pick up Brian that nobody heard and I was really upset and I said well where's Howard did you see a parachute and he didn't see anything

1228
01:59:50.14 --> 02:00:03.14
And I was kind of beefed about that but it was Howard he was my best friend and now he's down and never heard from him again but I did locate the wreck site

1229
02:00:03.14 --> 02:00:16.14
Dense jungle they didn't think there was any human beings anywhere near the place but he went down and he was there's a little ridge and you can see with the airplane

1230
02:00:16.14 --> 02:00:26.14
Clipped the jungle that was burning and went down into the canyon and you can see the wreckage and so every day I would go up there and real slow almost kill myself

1231
02:00:26.14 --> 02:00:35.14
Trying to go real slow and look down in there to see if I could see anything but it was just a wreck site

1232
02:00:35.14 --> 02:00:44.14
I didn't hear a thing so I thought can I go up there and on the ground and see my best buddy

1233
02:00:44.14 --> 02:00:57.14
So I made an arrangement out of the Khan Phenom in KP they have a radar site up there and they fly helicopters that they put the road watch thing

1234
02:00:57.14 --> 02:01:10.14
You know you guys you're you know you're vintage they go up there and the snake eaters like the classic snake eater and they put these guys in to watch the roads and stuff and report back and forth

1235
02:01:10.14 --> 02:01:15.14
Insert them and then they try to take them out and stuff

1236
02:01:15.14 --> 02:01:27.14
So I contacted them and I said hey can I get a ride in just you know on your way in drop me off at the wreck site and then when you're going to leave an hour or two when they come back and pick me up and bring me back

1237
02:01:27.14 --> 02:01:35.14
And then I will know what happened to Howard because if I see an ejection seat or something there then I will know whether he's dead or not

1238
02:01:35.14 --> 02:01:55.14
And so I had set that all up ready to go and I'm walking around bumping into myself too because I'm the summary courts officer so you have to you know I'm familiar with summary courts because if somebody gets killed somebody is designated as the guy that has to take care of his personal thing

1239
02:01:55.14 --> 02:01:59.14
and pay all his bills and pack all of his stuff up and write the letter to his wife and stuff

1240
02:01:59.14 --> 02:02:05.14
So that was my duty for that that I didn't like and I'm all set ready to go

1241
02:02:05.14 --> 02:02:11.14
Go over to Dan K.P. and they're going to take me out of the wreck site and get this phone call

1242
02:02:11.14 --> 02:02:21.14
And it says he said he was a major so I'm a major but I can't tell you my name

1243
02:02:21.14 --> 02:02:30.14
He says I know what you're going to do tomorrow exact words he says don't do it it's been taken care of

1244
02:02:30.14 --> 02:02:38.14
And he said do you understand that I says yeah he's been don't do it he's been taken care of I understand that

1245
02:02:38.14 --> 02:02:44.14
And then before I could ask any more questions he was gone so I didn't go

1246
02:02:44.14 --> 02:02:52.14
Now there was 18, 15 to 18 years later that I found out that they knew that Howard was dead

1247
02:02:52.14 --> 02:02:55.14
where they actually killed him and Laos they killed everybody

1248
02:02:55.14 --> 02:03:01.14
If you went down in Laos the policy was that they killed you every single one of them

1249
02:03:01.14 --> 02:03:09.14
There was no capture in North Vietnam you're a valuable asset

1250
02:03:09.14 --> 02:03:16.14
Now if you bail out of North Vietnam the civilians would kill you if they got to you first

1251
02:03:16.14 --> 02:03:26.14
But in fact I got another story about another F-105 pilot that I saw being decapitated with machetes right in front of my eyes

1252
02:03:26.14 --> 02:03:39.14
The thing about Howard it was 35 years later they found out what really happened that he was found on the ground and two stories

1253
02:03:39.14 --> 02:03:48.14
One of them went up there and they took his dog tags one guy said he was dead he had a broken leg and he was at the foot of a tree

1254
02:03:48.14 --> 02:03:56.14
But I know what happened Howard broke his leg and he was there and they went up and killed him and took his dog tags away from him

1255
02:03:56.14 --> 02:04:02.14
And then he told the farmer to bury him and that they didn't bury him deep enough

1256
02:04:02.14 --> 02:04:12.14
And he was exhumed by a large jungle animal and that's all they found of him 18 years later when we finally buried him in Arlington

1257
02:04:12.14 --> 02:04:15.14
What his remains were

1258
02:04:15.14 --> 02:04:20.14
What was the F-105 pilot that you saw get beheaded?

1259
02:04:20.14 --> 02:04:29.14
It was in the coastal plain now the coastal plain was flat right up to the edge of the ocean and it was all farmers

1260
02:04:29.14 --> 02:04:35.14
Rice paddies and farmlands and very sparsely populated and stuff

1261
02:04:35.14 --> 02:04:41.14
And we were on a misdi mission one day and I looked and coming right underneath me was this thing that was on fire

1262
02:04:41.14 --> 02:04:48.14
I didn't know that the 105 guy was even there and it was a big shock that guy was burning like mad

1263
02:04:48.14 --> 02:04:55.14
And so I pulled up and I could see he was trying to make a turn towards the water and fairly low altitude

1264
02:04:55.14 --> 02:05:00.14
Maybe three or four thousand feet or lower

1265
02:05:00.14 --> 02:05:05.14
And I wasn't talking to him or anything but I more or less joined up with him kind of high to watch him

1266
02:05:05.14 --> 02:05:11.14
Now I knew we realized the thing was on fire burning like mad this F-105 Thunder Chief

1267
02:05:11.14 --> 02:05:18.14
He was trying to turn to get to the water and it was kind of like a rooting section that's two misdies in the airplane

1268
02:05:18.14 --> 02:05:22.14
You know, come on hang in there you're going to make it you're almost there you're almost there

1269
02:05:22.14 --> 02:05:29.14
And then there was a big explosion in the airplane and it rolled upside down and the pilot ejected

1270
02:05:29.14 --> 02:05:36.14
And he was high enough that he got a good shoot and then the airplane the 105 went over and when he finally hit the ground

1271
02:05:36.14 --> 02:05:42.14
It looked like I don't know ten cans of napalm and then the biggest fireball I've ever seen

1272
02:05:42.14 --> 02:05:47.14
And so then now he's fairly low altitude he's hanging in a parachute

1273
02:05:47.14 --> 02:05:58.14
So I came around to circle him and you could kind of see you could see the shadow that the parachute had made

1274
02:05:58.14 --> 02:06:05.14
You could tell kind of how high it was and so I timed it so I came around based the final and I came by you know within

1275
02:06:05.14 --> 02:06:15.14
I don't know a dragon wing and a wingtip in the you know I mean really low twenty feet maybe right by him

1276
02:06:15.14 --> 02:06:24.14
Now he just as he landed in the rice paddy he took his helmet off he was taking his helmet off and he waved at me as I went by

1277
02:06:24.14 --> 02:06:33.14
And it was so close that I could recognize his face and then I noticed that there's a whole bunch of other gunners that were just shooting like mad

1278
02:06:33.14 --> 02:06:41.14
And so we pulled up higher back around and then it was the strangest thing I could see him in the rice paddy and there was a perfect circle

1279
02:06:41.14 --> 02:06:49.14
A black circle around him and it was all kind of collapsing on his on his point that's a black circle

1280
02:06:49.14 --> 02:06:55.14
It was the black pajamas everybody that this black silk pajamas everybody that would wear that they wore up there

1281
02:06:55.14 --> 02:07:01.14
And then he started running and this thing collapsed into a kind of a heart

1282
02:07:01.14 --> 02:07:15.14
And in my next pass I came around really low again and the farmers the farmers were on him and they all had machetes and they were chopping him up

1283
02:07:15.14 --> 02:07:26.14
And I pulled up and then you have really mixed emotions because I had the ability to kill every one of those people you know my twenty millimeter I could kill every one of those farmers

1284
02:07:26.14 --> 02:07:37.14
But then you don't know if the fighter pilot was alive or not probably wasn't but you know there's no way you could take any risk and then you pull up you have really a heavy heart

1285
02:07:37.14 --> 02:07:44.14
Holy crap you know pretty emotional thing

1286
02:07:44.14 --> 02:07:53.14
There was a there was also another rescue there was another shoot down that was I don't know maybe a number of weeks different

1287
02:07:53.14 --> 02:08:03.14
Here again it was another F-105 pilot and a wingman and he had his wingman and he got shot down

1288
02:08:03.14 --> 02:08:10.14
And I went tearing up there and found his parachute canopy on the top of a ridge

1289
02:08:10.14 --> 02:08:17.14
It was right off the quanky there was a quanky river south-forth of the quanky river and there's a little village down there

1290
02:08:17.14 --> 02:08:28.14
And it was a very steep slope that went up to the top of this ridge and as I came over came over I looked at it and I can see his parachute

1291
02:08:28.14 --> 02:08:36.14
And so we so he came around now his wingman is with me and we're talking and and I made a really a bad decision

1292
02:08:36.14 --> 02:08:41.14
I really screwed up and I still feel really bad about it today that I made a mistake that I shouldn't have

1293
02:08:41.14 --> 02:08:48.14
And that is I should have sent him to get fuel from our tanker right then

1294
02:08:48.14 --> 02:08:53.14
But the thing is that I could see the people in the village and they were starting up the hill

1295
02:08:53.14 --> 02:09:01.14
And so we took turns trying to put some strafe I wouldn't strafe in the people but I was putting strafe between the people

1296
02:09:01.14 --> 02:09:09.14
And in the pilot and I couldn't see his parachute anymore and he never came up on boys either

1297
02:09:09.14 --> 02:09:20.14
And so we were both doing that and instead of sending him out to get fuel or leaving him there to keep the while we got the rescue going

1298
02:09:20.14 --> 02:09:28.14
I could have went out and got fuel but all of a sudden we were really involved in keeping you know the people away from him so we could set up a rescue

1299
02:09:28.14 --> 02:09:39.14
I realized I should have done this to start with a major amateur screw up on my part I still feel bad about it today

1300
02:09:39.14 --> 02:09:46.14
Is that I didn't check and see how much fuel we had you know what's your fuel state and we're both ran out of fuel at the same time

1301
02:09:46.14 --> 02:09:55.14
So both of us had to leave and go out to the tanker and when we came back there was no voice anything

1302
02:09:55.14 --> 02:10:08.14
And the 105 pilot later on I've tried to find out who these pilots were and the guy that was on the top of the ridge I found that he had died

1303
02:10:08.14 --> 02:10:18.14
He never made it back as a prisoner of war but the guy that was in the rice pad he did and I don't have their names right now and it's not important

1304
02:10:18.14 --> 02:10:26.14
Anyway I was wrong about that and I found out later that the guy got killed and he did get chopped up by the farmers

1305
02:10:26.14 --> 02:10:37.14
And the guy on the top of the ridge he got captured and you know he made it through prisoner of war and I found out about it when they finally got released in 1973 I think it was

1306
02:10:37.14 --> 02:10:54.14
So as you're doing this and again there's incredible detailed stories in the book and about these missions that you're doing

1307
02:10:54.14 --> 02:11:03.14
I'm going to fast forward a little bit to well I guess it's a pretty notable mission for you

1308
02:11:03.14 --> 02:11:14.14
You were basically doing a test of a theory of bringing guys up that you worked directly with is that right?

1309
02:11:14.14 --> 02:11:27.14
One of our biggest problems is target accuracy and you know I'd hang it out and find a really great target I'd find a barge I'd find a storage area

1310
02:11:27.14 --> 02:11:39.14
And we have a flight of I don't know maybe it was a coincidence but my perception was that the F-4s could barely hit the ground much less my target

1311
02:11:39.14 --> 02:11:54.14
And it was not unusual that we'd put a flight of F-4s in on the target and my BDA was that there was no ordnance hit within 10,000 meters of my target no visible damage

1312
02:11:54.14 --> 02:12:02.14
It was very frustrating you have a beautiful target and they come in and they couldn't hit anywhere near it

1313
02:12:02.14 --> 02:12:11.14
Sometimes they get so frustrated that go down and the mischies would do this they weren't supposed to

1314
02:12:11.14 --> 02:12:22.14
We had our hard deck that we're supposed to and I get so frustrated that I go down and the trucks that they couldn't hit I go down and take out a couple of them with my two 20 millimeter cannons

1315
02:12:22.14 --> 02:12:31.14
And after giving that BDA I says and just before they'd leave frequency I'd pull up and say hey I got an addition to your BDA

1316
02:12:31.14 --> 02:12:42.14
Now we couldn't claim it for ourselves we'd all get fired but it's war and damn it this trucks are carrying bullets they're going to carry our kids in the south

1317
02:12:42.14 --> 02:12:55.14
You know it's worth taking a risk I thought and so by the way I want to revise your BDA you got two trucks killed didn't make any sense

1318
02:12:55.14 --> 02:13:06.14
But the so this new ideal is to bring up guys that you different aircraft that were you thought would have a better chance of hitting targets

1319
02:13:06.14 --> 02:13:17.14
Okay now we were frustrated about the ability to hit the targets and that was a big ongoing frustration we'd find it market accurately and nobody could hit it

1320
02:13:17.14 --> 02:13:19.14
Pretty fat

1321
02:13:19.14 --> 02:13:30.14
That's a side note happened once and I don't know why there was a flight of Navy A-4s off the Kitty Hawk

1322
02:13:30.14 --> 02:13:37.14
No man's and I never worked in Navy because you know I don't know what the Navy was doing in an Air Force area but there they were

1323
02:13:37.14 --> 02:13:46.14
And I had a what I looked like was a storage area and had bunkers and stuff look like there's fuel or ammo storage area pretty good target

1324
02:13:46.14 --> 02:13:56.14
And so wow A-4s would come up and no man would check in and you know they don't sound differently the Navy would sound different than the Air Force guys

1325
02:13:56.14 --> 02:14:05.14
So I said okay I got a bunker storage area and I described the target to him and I says okay you know we'll green him up, warm him up guys

1326
02:14:05.14 --> 02:14:15.14
Get ready to go because I'm in the mark so I pulled up went around put a nice mark in the target and I said okay hit my smoke

1327
02:14:15.14 --> 02:14:29.14
And I waited and waited and waited and finally the smoke excuse me started to dissipate and go away and ask him and I asked him I said hey you know man is there any problem do you see my smoke

1328
02:14:29.14 --> 02:14:36.14
He says oh yeah I saw your smoke misty but I was waiting for it to get the hell out of the way so I could see what the target was

1329
02:14:36.14 --> 02:14:47.14
I said I had never heard of that before I mean this is really strange the Air Force guys don't do that they just want to come up there and piss off their bombs and get their counters and go home early

1330
02:14:47.14 --> 02:15:00.14
Some of them and he says oh misty I see what you're looking at wow and now he took over you know normally the forward air controller we control the strikes and stuff

1331
02:15:00.14 --> 02:15:13.14
He says oh I know what it is he says oh okay and he described it to the other his flight and he says okay two you put your target your bombs there and three and so forth and he controlled the whole thing

1332
02:15:13.14 --> 02:15:28.14
And I'm sitting back and he says wow this is really cool and they did hit an ammo thing and it burned for a couple of days and I took some pictures of it and wrote a nice letter to the Navy for God's sake

1333
02:15:28.14 --> 02:15:38.14
And they invited us to the Kitty Hawk and we went out there and spent three days and combat operations off Yankee Station just because we wrote him a nice letter

1334
02:15:38.14 --> 02:15:54.14
It was really interesting these nomads another thing I found the Navy has a camaraderie between attack pilots and fighter pilots and it's big camaraderie

1335
02:15:54.14 --> 02:16:03.14
And they were hanging out with them for a while and they were wondering if they had an argument about something and he says oh Jake God damn it he says you're talking like a fighter pilot

1336
02:16:03.14 --> 02:16:10.14
And the guy says take that back you know and they're really arguing and say wait a minute I'm a fighter pilot you know what's wrong with that

1337
02:16:10.14 --> 02:16:13.14
But it was really a cool experience that we had with them

1338
02:16:13.14 --> 02:16:31.14
So anyway what we wanted to do this day is that now there's guys in that drop bombs in South Vietnam they're working troops in contact and you just don't piss bombs off around like we do up in North Vietnam

1339
02:16:31.14 --> 02:16:44.14
It has to be very accurate because there's troops in contact and there's other friendlies on the ground and the four air controllers in the South make great you know they go to great lengths that we don't go and bomb our own people

1340
02:16:44.14 --> 02:17:00.14
And so now these guys could really hit targets and so it's my buddy Chuck Shaheen in fact we were kind of high school buddies in some way we come from the same area around Dinova and we used to chase the same girls and so forth

1341
02:17:00.14 --> 02:17:20.14
So anyway Chuck had finished up his first tour he might have had I don't know maybe 60 sorties and I was working on 118 or 105 I guess mislead missions

1342
02:17:20.14 --> 02:17:47.14
And I had about five more to go before I was my normal rotation I says hey Chuck this year champagne flight hey how about two you know I'll go with you and you're back seat you know and I'll it'll be your champagne flight and it'll be a little article in the Orange Cove register that says two hometown boys complete combat tour and you know whatever a little blow up in some little po-dunk newspaper

1343
02:17:47.14 --> 02:18:00.14
But that's all it was going to be. So I had this this is going to be a test and so Chuck and I were going to go up there and find a target now these are in country guys they hadn't been to North Vietnam

1344
02:18:00.14 --> 02:18:23.14
And so I said now we got to find a real safe target for these guys you know some areas that you don't take newbies into them and some really intense area and so we're looking around for kind of a benign area and the best we could come up with is some god damn truck parked beside a harsh wall up there by a little river and a little road and this truck wasn't camouflage or anything

1345
02:18:23.14 --> 02:18:40.14
That should have been a clue right away. So finally we looked around and they said well this is about the best we can do but now this is a test these guys are the in country guys and they sent up some fighter weapons guys the guys been through the top their forces top gun school

1346
02:18:40.14 --> 02:19:02.14
Fighter weapons Nellis we call them patchwars guys with their patch that they've been through the top gun school guys were really good. So there were three of them then they come up and we briefed them and I guess they could see the truck and guys said okay leads in and he rolls in

1347
02:19:02.14 --> 02:19:22.14
He missed as bad as the F-4s did he pulled off missed the damn truck he saw best say I'm sorry I forgot to reset my altimeter well bullshit this is okay too and he had some other excuse that his mill his site didn't work right and he missed on

1348
02:19:22.14 --> 02:19:36.14
So the long and short of it is the three expert patchwars for bombing accuracy you know the first guys should have taken that truck out you know they could drop it right in the guy in the truck glove box if they wanted to what the hell is going on

1349
02:19:36.14 --> 02:19:46.14
So all of them all of them missed now right then our test was over and I should have stopped it right

1350
02:19:46.14 --> 02:20:02.14
I should have stopped it but however that damn truck was still sitting down there and that's when I'm going to take this to the book you say we couldn't bear to fail three passes same results and no 20 millimeter hits on the truck Chuck decided the misty fact should give it a

1351
02:20:02.14 --> 02:20:22.14
shot someone should have reminded us that when the 20 millimeter guns are beyond 3500 foot slant range the bullets just tumble and are rendered worthless until now we had all flown above 4500 foot hard deck unwilling to deny ourselves this stupid truck that seemed to be just sitting there taunting us Chuck went in

1352
02:20:22.14 --> 02:20:41.14
If the patchwars couldn't do it we would however we were we were the forward air controller not the fighter bomber and what we were about to do was in direct violation of standard protocol I checked the altitude indicator the three degree dive angle put us flat and right next right on top of the road

1353
02:20:41.14 --> 02:21:00.14
The karst cliff was now a blur close and right next to me we were low enough that I could even see the pebbles on the road this was a no kidding low angle Luke gun school strafe pass Chuck had the throttle in full burner burner real steady as only Chuck can fly

1354
02:21:00.14 --> 02:21:18.14
In the weeds now he opened fire and put a long concentrated burst of 20 millimeter cannon right on target I could not see the truck from the backseat but was certain he plastered it great we got some BDA the test was successful the champagne sweet even though the details were going to be fudged a

1355
02:21:18.14 --> 02:21:34.14
bit fudged hell in reality this mission was a total failure what happened in the next two seconds would nullify everything we had done Chuck came off the trigger and started a hard climb as the high G came on there was a loud bang under my right seat

1356
02:21:34.14 --> 02:21:51.14
it sounded as if Pete Rose had hit the bottom of the fuselage with a baseball bat and a home runs swing there was a whoosh as my rear view mirror was filled with fire when we pulled up I could see the fires glow on the cliff wall looking around I determined there were no good options for an ejection

1357
02:21:51.14 --> 02:22:07.14
I'm afraid it's Hanoi Hilton here we come the drop tanks had gone dry and Chuck called for a heads up as we were going to clean the wing and jettison the external fuel tanks pylons and rocket pods as we pulled up the other f 100s joined us and reported we were

1358
02:22:07.14 --> 02:22:23.14
torching and confirmed it wasn't an internal fire Chuck pulled it out of burner the and the angry red fire in the mirror changed to a white vapor the after burner flame had ignited the fuel stream and without it the fire choked itself out the fire was out but we were

1359
02:22:23.14 --> 02:22:41.14
hammering fuel at a prodigious rate there was talk about turning off generators transfer pumps looking for a tanker etc but no practical solution presented itself as we looked ahead at the coast coming up in the distance and watch the fuel gauge rapidly unwind it was

1360
02:22:41.14 --> 02:22:57.14
painful obvious the gauge would read empty before we reached long before we reached the water all we could do now was reflight the relight the after burner and use the remaining fuel for speed before it completely gushed out hoping we could still make it to the safety of the

1361
02:22:57.14 --> 02:23:12.14
gulf of Tonkin the guys on our wing looked closely to see if the fuel was running inside the fuselage where it might blow us out of the sky upon relighting the after burner they let us know it didn't look like it but there was no way to know for sure

1362
02:23:12.14 --> 02:23:32.14
fighter pilots like to fly close for some reason it seems the closer you get the more help you can lend a stricken comrad as we look down at the small farms of the coastal plain knowing farmers were waiting with machetes in hand this decision became a no brainer Chuck calmly called

1363
02:23:32.14 --> 02:23:50.14
okay we're gonna relight the burner we had never seen two wingman go from close fingertip to high forward spread root formation so quickly those guys got away from you Chuck mumbled something about candy asses and if those patchwares hit the damn truck we wouldn't be in this fix

1364
02:23:50.14 --> 02:24:06.14
he pushed the throttle outboard board and relight the burner the white vapor stream in my mirror again turned red with fire the wingman said no sweat it's only torching wow some torch it was only seven it was over 700 feet long we were accelerating in a slight calm

1365
02:24:06.14 --> 02:24:23.14
climb low on fuel with wings clean and going like stink I think we may have gone supersonic Chuck's decision to relight the burner was a good one and it looked like we might make it to the water pilot seemed to prioritize things only after returning to Foucat that I remember hearing a loud

1366
02:24:23.14 --> 02:24:39.14
rattlesnake sound in the headset and notice something on the glare shield our threat warning system was showing a Sam missile it was going wild surface to air missile launch flight panel was lit up like a Christmas tree we were for F4s flying straight and level to the

1367
02:24:39.14 --> 02:24:57.14
coast a perfect target but no one in our formation gave this warning more than a passing passing glance normally we would have we would have called Sam Sam and broken for the deck afterward the patchware lead told me yes I do remember that I just reached up and turned it off for some reason the enemy did not launch the

1368
02:24:57.14 --> 02:25:15.14
Sam's they probably thought we were going to die in the fire so why waste a missile I believe most warriors during times during the intense heat of combat resigned themselves to the likelihood that survival is improbable as I sat there watching the torrent of fire behind us the

1369
02:25:15.14 --> 02:25:33.14
unwinding full fuel gauge and the distant and that distant coast growing nearer deep in my psyche a small glimmer of hope emerged maybe we can make it we might actually get out of this alive not dead and not as POWs halfway to the safety the water I made a promise to

1370
02:25:33.14 --> 02:25:51.14
myself that if we could make it to the coast and eject and get rescued I would not be coming up here anymore this is my hundred and fifth misty sorty almost twice that of a normie normal misty tour no one could ever say I was a coward or a quitter my next action had to be done perfectly I

1371
02:25:51.14 --> 02:26:09.14
would be like to eject on that violent rocket seat riding up and out I studied and trained for each of the procedures I even joined a skydiving club and completed 50 sport parachute jumps I couldn't have been better prepared I'd always been paranoid about my personal

1372
02:26:09.14 --> 02:26:13.06
made it clear that no one else was to touch it, ever.

1373
02:26:13.06 --> 02:26:15.86
I would meticulously adjust the straps to my frame

1374
02:26:15.86 --> 02:26:18.46
since I had practical experience in skydiving.

1375
02:26:18.46 --> 02:26:21.38
I was well acquainted with the agony to the groin area

1376
02:26:21.38 --> 02:26:24.98
and the twins that resulted from an ill-fitting harness.

1377
02:26:24.98 --> 02:26:29.98
A perfect fit was critical and was always on my mind.

1378
02:26:30.34 --> 02:26:33.38
Prior to my ejection, I considered a few things,

1379
02:26:33.38 --> 02:26:34.78
but not in any sequence.

1380
02:26:34.78 --> 02:26:36.82
I remembered running out of fuel.

1381
02:26:36.82 --> 02:26:39.06
Chuck had the Hun in full afterburner

1382
02:26:39.06 --> 02:26:41.74
and we both watched the fuel gauge unwind to zero.

1383
02:26:41.74 --> 02:26:44.30
I always wondered how accurate those gauges were

1384
02:26:44.30 --> 02:26:46.50
and was about to find out.

1385
02:26:46.50 --> 02:26:49.34
As the needle passed empty, the engine quit.

1386
02:26:50.38 --> 02:26:52.02
This was not a sudden flame out,

1387
02:26:52.02 --> 02:26:54.58
but reminded me of a pilot slowly pulling the throttle

1388
02:26:54.58 --> 02:26:55.94
back to idle.

1389
02:26:55.94 --> 02:26:58.06
However, the RPM did not stop at idle,

1390
02:26:58.06 --> 02:26:59.54
but continued to unwind.

1391
02:26:59.54 --> 02:27:01.26
I recalled that there were a lot of towering,

1392
02:27:01.26 --> 02:27:03.26
cumulus clouds off the coast.

1393
02:27:03.26 --> 02:27:05.86
Chuck and I searched for an area to eject

1394
02:27:05.86 --> 02:27:08.14
and as soon as we spotted a break in the clouds,

1395
02:27:08.14 --> 02:27:09.26
we knew it was time.

1396
02:27:10.18 --> 02:27:13.94
The HC-130 Hercules search and rescue plane Crown 6

1397
02:27:13.94 --> 02:27:16.38
had just popped into view, which was comforting.

1398
02:27:16.38 --> 02:27:18.98
During the course of this entire catastrophic mission,

1399
02:27:18.98 --> 02:27:20.62
my cassette recorder had been running,

1400
02:27:20.62 --> 02:27:22.14
but I neglected to remove the tape

1401
02:27:22.14 --> 02:27:24.58
and put it in my pocket prior to ejection.

1402
02:27:24.58 --> 02:27:25.42
Bummer.

1403
02:27:26.82 --> 02:27:28.06
As soon as we made it to the Gulf,

1404
02:27:28.06 --> 02:27:30.42
I experienced an odd sense of calm.

1405
02:27:30.42 --> 02:27:33.90
I realized this would be my final combat mission.

1406
02:27:33.90 --> 02:27:35.78
This was the first time I truly believed

1407
02:27:35.78 --> 02:27:38.06
I would make it out of the war alive.

1408
02:27:38.06 --> 02:27:40.14
I was going home to see my family.

1409
02:27:40.14 --> 02:27:43.62
All I had to do now was simply eject and get rescued.

1410
02:27:43.62 --> 02:27:45.50
I had complete faith in my equipment,

1411
02:27:45.50 --> 02:27:48.30
but whether it was good and the Gulf glass smooth

1412
02:27:48.30 --> 02:27:50.14
and inviting was welcoming me.

1413
02:27:50.14 --> 02:27:53.14
Yes, this was going to be a piece of cake.

1414
02:27:53.14 --> 02:27:55.54
We had the ideal speed and altitude necessary

1415
02:27:55.54 --> 02:27:57.82
for a successful ejection.

1416
02:27:57.82 --> 02:28:00.56
I said, well, Chuck, it's time to go.

1417
02:28:01.70 --> 02:28:04.58
I reminded Chuck about the half-second delay on his seat.

1418
02:28:04.58 --> 02:28:07.34
He responded, no, if you go first, there's no delay.

1419
02:28:07.34 --> 02:28:10.26
I began to argue, but thought better of it.

1420
02:28:10.26 --> 02:28:14.98
Okay, now visor down, straps tight, elbows in,

1421
02:28:14.98 --> 02:28:16.86
head back hard on the headrest.

1422
02:28:17.76 --> 02:28:20.58
I closed my eyes, lifted the seat handles,

1423
02:28:20.58 --> 02:28:23.02
and while squeezing both triggers,

1424
02:28:23.02 --> 02:28:27.04
wondered what the next five minutes of my life would be like.

1425
02:28:27.04 --> 02:28:30.86
I wanted to avoid being anywhere near the Huns point of impact.

1426
02:28:30.86 --> 02:28:34.32
My rocket seat fired and the E-ticket ride up the rails

1427
02:28:34.32 --> 02:28:36.26
was slow, smooth, and wonderful.

1428
02:28:36.26 --> 02:28:37.18
It worked.

1429
02:28:38.50 --> 02:28:40.22
Once clear, I kicked the seat away from me

1430
02:28:40.22 --> 02:28:42.20
and my shoot opened with a jerk.

1431
02:28:42.20 --> 02:28:45.10
Looking around, I saw three F-100s, crown six,

1432
02:28:45.10 --> 02:28:47.38
and a couple of F-4s that had joined the orbit.

1433
02:28:47.38 --> 02:28:49.22
I looked around for Chuck, but didn't spot him

1434
02:28:49.22 --> 02:28:50.68
or a crippled Hun.

1435
02:28:51.74 --> 02:28:53.62
I could only assume Chuck had waited a while

1436
02:28:53.62 --> 02:28:55.30
and ejected inside a cloud.

1437
02:28:55.30 --> 02:28:57.50
I retrieved the survival radio, turned it on,

1438
02:28:57.50 --> 02:28:59.62
and expected to hear my shoot locator beeper,

1439
02:28:59.62 --> 02:29:00.66
but heard nothing.

1440
02:29:00.66 --> 02:29:02.94
I had made two emergency ejections in my lifetime

1441
02:29:02.94 --> 02:29:04.74
and the shoot beepers failed on both.

1442
02:29:04.74 --> 02:29:07.42
I tried to call, but couldn't work the damn thing

1443
02:29:07.42 --> 02:29:09.92
with my helmet on, so I put the radio away.

1444
02:29:11.38 --> 02:29:14.50
The next item was the four line parachute cut.

1445
02:29:14.50 --> 02:29:18.02
Sure enough, the conical C9 shoot canopy

1446
02:29:18.02 --> 02:29:19.62
would oscillate side to side

1447
02:29:19.62 --> 02:29:22.10
as air spilled out one side than the other.

1448
02:29:22.10 --> 02:29:25.58
I loved skydiving, was eager to test the four line cut.

1449
02:29:25.58 --> 02:29:28.86
Cutting four of the 28 lines would allow air to escape

1450
02:29:28.86 --> 02:29:31.58
in a controlled manner and stabilize the canopy.

1451
02:29:31.58 --> 02:29:34.34
I grabbed my government issued hook blade knife

1452
02:29:34.34 --> 02:29:36.94
and reached for the two shroud lines on my right

1453
02:29:36.94 --> 02:29:38.02
and cut them.

1454
02:29:38.02 --> 02:29:41.34
Next, I grabbed the two left hook, hook the knife around

1455
02:29:41.34 --> 02:29:44.10
the shroud lines, cutting those two clean,

1456
02:29:44.10 --> 02:29:46.50
but to my horror, there was another cut.

1457
02:29:46.50 --> 02:29:49.66
I had accidentally cut into one

1458
02:29:49.66 --> 02:29:51.98
of the four suspension risers.

1459
02:29:53.22 --> 02:29:55.38
I slowly turned to survey the damage

1460
02:29:55.38 --> 02:29:59.86
and saw the nylon web riser was cut 90% of the way through.

1461
02:29:59.86 --> 02:30:02.14
Had I cut it completely, the shoot would have collapsed

1462
02:30:02.14 --> 02:30:04.58
and I would have streamed it into the gulf.

1463
02:30:04.58 --> 02:30:05.66
My heart was in my throat.

1464
02:30:05.66 --> 02:30:10.42
My God, fly 155 Misty missions and die by my own hand.

1465
02:30:11.62 --> 02:30:14.58
I think Jonesy, the first Misty to fly 100 missions

1466
02:30:14.58 --> 02:30:16.86
did the same thing on his final mission bailout.

1467
02:30:16.86 --> 02:30:19.18
Do not give fighter pilots knives.

1468
02:30:19.18 --> 02:30:21.62
Much later, someone in the parachute shop got smart

1469
02:30:21.62 --> 02:30:24.18
and took away the knives from the flailing fighter pilots

1470
02:30:24.18 --> 02:30:26.54
and replaced them with a four line release system

1471
02:30:26.54 --> 02:30:28.22
that required no cutting.

1472
02:30:28.22 --> 02:30:30.54
Hanging in the shoot, I took one last look

1473
02:30:30.54 --> 02:30:33.42
at North Vietnam, remembering all that had happened

1474
02:30:33.42 --> 02:30:35.30
to me during the past eight months.

1475
02:30:35.30 --> 02:30:38.10
As the realization that I would not be returning to a cold,

1476
02:30:38.10 --> 02:30:42.66
I was flooded with an unanticipated sense of relief.

1477
02:30:42.66 --> 02:30:45.74
I remembered to deploy my raft in my survival kit,

1478
02:30:45.74 --> 02:30:48.54
but was so shaken from the knife and parachute episode

1479
02:30:48.54 --> 02:30:51.94
that I had forgotten to activate my underarm life preservers

1480
02:30:51.94 --> 02:30:53.98
until just before hitting the water.

1481
02:30:53.98 --> 02:30:55.86
Without them, the weight of the survival gear

1482
02:30:55.86 --> 02:30:57.82
would have pulled me straight to the bottom of the gulf,

1483
02:30:57.82 --> 02:30:59.38
sinking me like a brick.

1484
02:30:59.38 --> 02:31:01.38
I barely had time to inflate one side

1485
02:31:01.38 --> 02:31:03.78
as my feet hit the warm, clear water.

1486
02:31:03.78 --> 02:31:06.94
With no wind, my chutes settled right on top of me.

1487
02:31:06.94 --> 02:31:07.86
What a mess.

1488
02:31:07.86 --> 02:31:09.78
I struggled to untangle myself,

1489
02:31:09.78 --> 02:31:12.78
pulled the raft over and boarded.

1490
02:31:12.78 --> 02:31:15.62
I attempted to relax and enjoy the quiet solitude

1491
02:31:15.62 --> 02:31:20.22
as a new member of the exclusive Gulf of Tonkin Yacht Club.

1492
02:31:21.14 --> 02:31:24.02
It was amazing how clear the water was

1493
02:31:24.02 --> 02:31:29.82
and how good survival smelled.

1494
02:31:29.82 --> 02:31:33.66
Ha!

1495
02:31:33.66 --> 02:31:40.46
As I read these ejection stories,

1496
02:31:40.46 --> 02:31:44.46
I'm always surprised that you guys have time to think about it

1497
02:31:44.46 --> 02:31:45.98
and set it up kind of.

1498
02:31:45.98 --> 02:31:48.54
I always, in my mind, I always pictured ejections.

1499
02:31:48.54 --> 02:31:51.66
You get hit and you have a second and you just pull it and you go.

1500
02:31:51.66 --> 02:31:53.14
And you guys are sitting there thinking like,

1501
02:31:53.14 --> 02:31:55.14
okay, well, it looks like we're far enough.

1502
02:31:55.14 --> 02:31:56.98
We got it a good altitude.

1503
02:31:56.98 --> 02:31:58.74
You have time to think about it.

1504
02:31:58.74 --> 02:32:03.10
On this particular engine, there was a lot of time.

1505
02:32:03.10 --> 02:32:07.54
So, you know, we talk about the warrior ethic.

1506
02:32:07.54 --> 02:32:11.86
A real warrior, if he worries about making it home,

1507
02:32:11.86 --> 02:32:13.90
he's nowhere to shit as a warrior.

1508
02:32:13.90 --> 02:32:16.10
He might as well just stay home.

1509
02:32:16.10 --> 02:32:19.06
And if you're going to go up and do warrior-type things,

1510
02:32:19.06 --> 02:32:21.70
you have to accept the realization

1511
02:32:21.70 --> 02:32:23.62
that you're probably not going to make it.

1512
02:32:23.62 --> 02:32:29.34
And once you do that, then you can become an effective warrior.

1513
02:32:29.34 --> 02:32:30.74
You can focus on the job.

1514
02:32:30.74 --> 02:32:32.74
That's right.

1515
02:32:32.74 --> 02:32:34.14
On fire, burning out there,

1516
02:32:34.14 --> 02:32:36.66
and I thought maybe I was going to make it for the first time.

1517
02:32:36.66 --> 02:32:43.82
I thought, because I had this premonition about being captured.

1518
02:32:43.82 --> 02:32:48.06
In fact, I used to go down into our intelligence section

1519
02:32:48.06 --> 02:32:50.18
where they could get a lot of classified information.

1520
02:32:50.18 --> 02:32:52.62
And I was surprised about how much they knew

1521
02:32:52.62 --> 02:32:55.30
about the prisoner or war status,

1522
02:32:55.30 --> 02:32:58.50
even the interrogators and their name and the new guy village

1523
02:32:58.50 --> 02:33:00.34
and what was going to happen to you

1524
02:33:00.34 --> 02:33:03.18
and those rope tortures and stuff.

1525
02:33:03.18 --> 02:33:05.66
I was very, very familiar with that.

1526
02:33:05.66 --> 02:33:07.98
And it was like a premonition.

1527
02:33:07.98 --> 02:33:15.38
And when we got hit and pulled off, I thought, this is it, man.

1528
02:33:15.38 --> 02:33:17.10
What are they calling the rat or something?

1529
02:33:17.10 --> 02:33:20.78
And I said, well, I think I'm going to be able to meet the rat now.

1530
02:33:20.78 --> 02:33:22.78
And then all of a sudden, that full transition,

1531
02:33:22.78 --> 02:33:26.30
I think we may make it to the water.

1532
02:33:26.30 --> 02:33:29.94
And then for the first time, I thought, I'm going to make it.

1533
02:33:29.94 --> 02:33:32.98
And since I'd done two tours, almost two tours,

1534
02:33:32.98 --> 02:33:34.34
nobody would give me any problem.

1535
02:33:34.34 --> 02:33:38.18
I said, man, I found everything that I needed,

1536
02:33:38.18 --> 02:33:40.98
everything I wanted to know about, you know,

1537
02:33:40.98 --> 02:33:43.02
maybe it's the selfish thing.

1538
02:33:43.02 --> 02:33:45.02
Could I be one of those warriors?

1539
02:33:45.02 --> 02:33:47.90
Could I be one of those guys that flew those missions over

1540
02:33:47.90 --> 02:33:51.94
Nazi Germany when three out of four of them died?

1541
02:33:51.94 --> 02:33:54.82
Did I have the courage?

1542
02:33:54.82 --> 02:33:57.02
Could I really do that?

1543
02:33:57.02 --> 02:33:58.38
And I found out.

1544
02:33:58.38 --> 02:34:03.50
And having that information to me subconsciously

1545
02:34:03.50 --> 02:34:07.62
from my own personal psyche was really important.

1546
02:34:07.62 --> 02:34:11.42
And I learned a lot of other things, too.

1547
02:34:11.42 --> 02:34:15.30
I made a survey of some fellow fighter pilots.

1548
02:34:15.30 --> 02:34:19.66
And it says, the thing is, what happened when you first

1549
02:34:19.66 --> 02:34:21.02
started to be shot at?

1550
02:34:21.02 --> 02:34:24.02
The very first reaction, the very first time.

1551
02:34:24.02 --> 02:34:27.34
And we talked about it in the book a little bit.

1552
02:34:27.34 --> 02:34:32.18
The first reaction was the audacity, not that I'm scared,

1553
02:34:32.18 --> 02:34:36.74
not I'm going to drink away and duck down between my knees

1554
02:34:36.74 --> 02:34:37.98
or whatever.

1555
02:34:37.98 --> 02:34:42.10
It was the audacity of that son of a bitch that shot at me.

1556
02:34:42.10 --> 02:34:44.54
That's the first reaction.

1557
02:34:44.54 --> 02:34:49.10
And maybe that's, I don't know, maybe a right of passage

1558
02:34:49.10 --> 02:34:50.66
into being a warrior.

1559
02:34:50.66 --> 02:34:52.86
So what was the survey?

1560
02:34:52.86 --> 02:34:58.10
Oh, it was the survey that I, they were just mainly

1561
02:34:58.10 --> 02:34:59.54
fellow fighter pilots.

1562
02:34:59.54 --> 02:35:03.50
And I tried to ask some of the people that

1563
02:35:03.50 --> 02:35:10.34
were that had ground compact, Dike, you did, and John.

1564
02:35:10.34 --> 02:35:11.50
What was their reaction?

1565
02:35:11.50 --> 02:35:15.10
But I wasn't able to really, that was an informal thing.

1566
02:35:15.10 --> 02:35:18.46
I just wanted to know, was I unique,

1567
02:35:18.46 --> 02:35:21.46
or was this very, very typical of what happened when you first

1568
02:35:21.46 --> 02:35:22.38
get shot?

1569
02:35:22.38 --> 02:35:25.42
And I found that it's probably fairly typical,

1570
02:35:25.42 --> 02:35:27.46
that there wasn't any of the guys that I knew about,

1571
02:35:27.46 --> 02:35:34.30
that I flew with when they first got shot, that duck down

1572
02:35:34.30 --> 02:35:37.86
and screamed from my mother or whatever.

1573
02:35:37.86 --> 02:35:39.02
It was just the audacity.

1574
02:35:39.02 --> 02:35:43.90
And then if you survive that, you're a warrior.

1575
02:35:43.90 --> 02:35:46.66
And I would like to think that maybe that was a pretty common

1576
02:35:46.66 --> 02:35:52.54
thing, too, on all aspects of mortal combat

1577
02:35:52.54 --> 02:35:53.42
with your fellow men.

1578
02:35:53.42 --> 02:36:01.34
So that was your last combat operation in Vietnam.

1579
02:36:01.34 --> 02:36:02.94
So what happened after that?

1580
02:36:02.94 --> 02:36:06.14
I mean, after that, do they give you an option and say,

1581
02:36:06.14 --> 02:36:09.66
all right, you can head home now?

1582
02:36:09.66 --> 02:36:11.70
Well, I still had my one year tour.

1583
02:36:11.70 --> 02:36:16.38
And I only had about a week or 10 days.

1584
02:36:16.38 --> 02:36:20.86
Now, the misdeeds, if you're involved in something like that,

1585
02:36:20.86 --> 02:36:23.98
nobody give us any crap about our illegal hats

1586
02:36:23.98 --> 02:36:26.34
or illegal mustaches.

1587
02:36:26.34 --> 02:36:27.66
I saw a picture of your mustache.

1588
02:36:27.66 --> 02:36:28.14
It looks pretty good.

1589
02:36:28.14 --> 02:36:29.50
It's a tiny, illegal.

1590
02:36:29.50 --> 02:36:31.26
Any goddamn thing you want it to do.

1591
02:36:31.26 --> 02:36:33.66
There was always some spit and polish colonel

1592
02:36:33.66 --> 02:36:38.86
that would come up and give us a bunch of crap about things

1593
02:36:38.86 --> 02:36:42.42
that are not really germane to a combat operation

1594
02:36:42.42 --> 02:36:45.26
in the jungles of frickin' Vietnam.

1595
02:36:45.26 --> 02:36:48.38
I'm excited in my shoes or something like that.

1596
02:36:48.38 --> 02:36:50.30
And it says, OK, Colonel, why don't you?

1597
02:36:50.30 --> 02:36:52.50
It says, I'm scheduled for a misdi-1-1 in the morning.

1598
02:36:52.50 --> 02:36:54.34
Why don't you take my mission for me?

1599
02:36:54.34 --> 02:36:57.30
And I'll stay home and clean my shoes.

1600
02:36:57.30 --> 02:36:58.14
That's OK.

1601
02:36:58.14 --> 02:36:59.30
Cool.

1602
02:36:59.30 --> 02:37:03.18
So basically, if you are in an environment

1603
02:37:03.18 --> 02:37:06.22
where you're probably not going to make it anyway,

1604
02:37:06.22 --> 02:37:08.70
that was your mindset.

1605
02:37:08.70 --> 02:37:10.38
We did a bunch of other stuff.

1606
02:37:10.38 --> 02:37:13.22
We acquired our own DC-3, a whole DC-3.

1607
02:37:13.22 --> 02:37:17.98
And we go back and forth to Hong Kong anytime we wanted to.

1608
02:37:17.98 --> 02:37:21.66
Or we're supposed to have one R&R where you meet your wife

1609
02:37:21.66 --> 02:37:22.62
in Hawaii.

1610
02:37:22.62 --> 02:37:25.02
And the guys that were married, we'd go to Hawaii.

1611
02:37:25.02 --> 02:37:28.02
Well, we'd go in forged papers.

1612
02:37:28.02 --> 02:37:36.30
Or one of them was we'd go down to the personnel or the admin

1613
02:37:36.30 --> 02:37:38.50
off, and they had these forms.

1614
02:37:38.50 --> 02:37:44.46
And one of the forms was for emergency leave.

1615
02:37:44.46 --> 02:37:45.78
And so we got a real one.

1616
02:37:45.78 --> 02:37:47.06
And we looked at it.

1617
02:37:47.06 --> 02:37:49.10
And somebody had a typewriter.

1618
02:37:49.10 --> 02:37:51.34
And so we could copy that form.

1619
02:37:51.34 --> 02:37:52.58
Nobody ever checked on it.

1620
02:37:52.58 --> 02:37:55.78
I mean, it was an authorized form.

1621
02:37:55.78 --> 02:38:01.86
And so in my example, we made up authorization

1622
02:38:01.86 --> 02:38:02.86
in some colonels name.

1623
02:38:02.86 --> 02:38:04.46
And it would always have fun.

1624
02:38:04.46 --> 02:38:08.82
He could sign his name at the left hand or the right hand.

1625
02:38:08.82 --> 02:38:10.90
I mean, it looked official, but it was phony as hell

1626
02:38:10.90 --> 02:38:12.98
because we just made them up.

1627
02:38:12.98 --> 02:38:14.38
And I used one of those.

1628
02:38:14.38 --> 02:38:18.62
And I went down to the cargo area there at Foucet.

1629
02:38:18.62 --> 02:38:19.98
And I handed this.

1630
02:38:19.98 --> 02:38:23.86
And within 24 hours, I was back in the sack with my wife

1631
02:38:23.86 --> 02:38:26.54
and Sacramento.

1632
02:38:26.54 --> 02:38:27.98
This was after you got shot down?

1633
02:38:27.98 --> 02:38:28.62
No, no, no.

1634
02:38:28.62 --> 02:38:29.50
Oh, that was just normal.

1635
02:38:29.50 --> 02:38:31.66
It was during the eight months that I was there.

1636
02:38:31.66 --> 02:38:32.14
Right.

1637
02:38:32.14 --> 02:38:33.50
We just took this emergency leave.

1638
02:38:33.50 --> 02:38:35.42
Yeah, we'd go to Hong Kong if we wanted to.

1639
02:38:35.42 --> 02:38:37.02
Nobody mess with us at all.

1640
02:38:37.02 --> 02:38:41.58
The only thing that we couldn't forge was pay.

1641
02:38:41.58 --> 02:38:43.42
You're probably lucky you couldn't.

1642
02:38:43.42 --> 02:38:44.58
Yeah, but anything else.

1643
02:38:44.58 --> 02:38:46.14
Otherwise, you would have probably been in.

1644
02:38:46.14 --> 02:38:47.18
They probably would have caught that one.

1645
02:38:47.18 --> 02:38:48.30
No, they would have caught that one.

1646
02:38:48.30 --> 02:38:49.74
And that wouldn't have been right anyway.

1647
02:38:49.74 --> 02:38:51.90
But as far as anything else, we'd go and do whatever

1648
02:38:51.90 --> 02:38:54.22
the hell we wanted to.

1649
02:38:54.22 --> 02:38:58.78
And not only that, the Mrs. were known for, oh,

1650
02:38:58.78 --> 02:39:00.50
I've got to give you something too.

1651
02:39:00.50 --> 02:39:03.26
It's our calling card.

1652
02:39:03.26 --> 02:39:04.82
We could do whatever we want to.

1653
02:39:04.82 --> 02:39:07.10
So I went down and I spent seven days at home, which

1654
02:39:07.10 --> 02:39:08.06
was totally illegal.

1655
02:39:08.06 --> 02:39:10.22
You're not even supposed to go home at all.

1656
02:39:10.22 --> 02:39:14.54
But my emergency leave papers worked just fine.

1657
02:39:14.54 --> 02:39:17.86
And so in Travis Air Force Base, where my wife and my one

1658
02:39:17.86 --> 02:39:23.94
daughter was there, I went back and I gave them my

1659
02:39:23.94 --> 02:39:26.46
emergency leave orders.

1660
02:39:26.46 --> 02:39:29.50
And the dispatcher there at the military transport or a

1661
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:34.34
mass terminal, he says, OK, you and your wife, go back and

1662
02:39:34.34 --> 02:39:36.70
have a nice steak dinner at the club and a bottle of wine

1663
02:39:36.70 --> 02:39:39.06
and come back here at 10 o'clock.

1664
02:39:39.06 --> 02:39:40.54
And you'll be on your way.

1665
02:39:40.54 --> 02:39:42.90
We've got a flight going out for you.

1666
02:39:42.90 --> 02:39:43.78
And so I did.

1667
02:39:43.78 --> 02:39:45.66
And like I said, less than 24 hours.

1668
02:39:45.66 --> 02:39:48.06
I think in 20 hours, I was back in Foucait.

1669
02:39:48.06 --> 02:39:53.70
I thought, I could almost commute to this thing.

1670
02:39:53.70 --> 02:39:59.34
So it was really a double make error.

1671
02:39:59.34 --> 02:40:00.58
We're misleads.

1672
02:40:00.58 --> 02:40:02.06
We do all this stuff.

1673
02:40:02.06 --> 02:40:04.06
Nobody's going to fuck with us.

1674
02:40:04.06 --> 02:40:06.46
On the ground or in the air.

1675
02:40:06.46 --> 02:40:10.10
Now, I'll show you my calling card.

1676
02:40:10.10 --> 02:40:11.42
You'll get a kick out of this.

1677
02:40:21.10 --> 02:40:23.50
It's two sides.

1678
02:40:23.50 --> 02:40:25.42
I think you could look at that and maybe read it.

1679
02:40:25.42 --> 02:40:32.50
So Side One says, get fact by a super fact.

1680
02:40:32.50 --> 02:40:33.62
Because they were the supersavers.

1681
02:40:33.62 --> 02:40:34.62
They called them super facts.

1682
02:40:34.62 --> 02:40:38.02
Get fact by a super fact called Misty.

1683
02:40:38.02 --> 02:40:41.22
For appointment, contact Hillsborough or Cricket.

1684
02:40:41.22 --> 02:40:41.70
What are those?

1685
02:40:41.70 --> 02:40:42.26
What's Hillsborough?

1686
02:40:42.26 --> 02:40:44.70
Those are airborne command.

1687
02:40:44.70 --> 02:40:49.66
Airborne, air traffic control for the one of another word.

1688
02:40:49.66 --> 02:40:51.02
Easy terms.

1689
02:40:51.02 --> 02:40:54.22
Flak free areas optional at extra cost.

1690
02:40:54.22 --> 02:41:00.34
Specializing in sands, trucks, supply areas, and rest caps.

1691
02:41:00.34 --> 02:41:04.42
Then on the other side, it says, do not make rapid movements.

1692
02:41:04.42 --> 02:41:08.30
This man is a trained professional killer hired by your government

1693
02:41:08.30 --> 02:41:11.02
to seek out and destroy enemies of the state.

1694
02:41:11.02 --> 02:41:13.54
He has nerves of twisted blue steel

1695
02:41:13.54 --> 02:41:15.86
and must be handled very carefully.

1696
02:41:15.86 --> 02:41:19.10
When done so, he becomes very docile.

1697
02:41:19.10 --> 02:41:23.06
You advise to give him the love and care he needs so badly.

1698
02:41:23.06 --> 02:41:25.94
Signed US Department of Defense.

1699
02:41:25.94 --> 02:41:27.86
You can keep that, please.

1700
02:41:27.86 --> 02:41:28.86
Outstanding.

1701
02:41:31.86 --> 02:41:32.54
So what happens?

1702
02:41:32.54 --> 02:41:34.18
So now the war's over for you.

1703
02:41:34.18 --> 02:41:35.22
The war's over for me.

1704
02:41:35.22 --> 02:41:42.22
And then I got sent directly to another war, that important war.

1705
02:41:42.22 --> 02:41:45.90
A war that if we'd lost, we'd lose our flight.

1706
02:41:45.90 --> 02:41:48.58
And that was the Cold War.

1707
02:41:48.58 --> 02:41:50.46
And then right out of the jungles of Vietnam,

1708
02:41:50.46 --> 02:41:54.30
I found myself sitting in the same F-100

1709
02:41:54.30 --> 02:41:58.14
with a one megaton thermoduclear hydrogen bomb

1710
02:41:58.14 --> 02:42:02.42
on the centerline pylon, sitting in a bunker with a target

1711
02:42:02.42 --> 02:42:05.82
someplace on the other side of the iron curtain for four years.

1712
02:42:05.82 --> 02:42:07.98
And were you stationed in England at this time?

1713
02:42:07.98 --> 02:42:09.50
Staged in England.

1714
02:42:09.50 --> 02:42:12.38
So how long, what's your schedule like?

1715
02:42:12.38 --> 02:42:16.02
Well, schedule, it was a three month rotation.

1716
02:42:16.02 --> 02:42:21.54
You spent a month at home, family and training.

1717
02:42:21.54 --> 02:42:24.50
And then we spent a month at Willis in North Africa

1718
02:42:24.50 --> 02:42:29.78
doing gunnery training, dropping bombs and whatever.

1719
02:42:29.78 --> 02:42:32.50
And then you spent another, then in the third month,

1720
02:42:32.50 --> 02:42:34.22
you ran a bunker someplace.

1721
02:42:34.22 --> 02:42:35.54
Just waiting to make the flight.

1722
02:42:35.54 --> 02:42:38.26
Right on the right next to the iron curtain

1723
02:42:38.26 --> 02:42:40.26
with a target on the other side someplace,

1724
02:42:40.26 --> 02:42:43.50
like in Turkey, more in Italy.

1725
02:42:43.50 --> 02:42:50.90
So that was the nighty day or this 30 day rotation.

1726
02:42:50.90 --> 02:42:53.06
Did you ever get spun up?

1727
02:42:53.06 --> 02:42:54.98
What was the closest you came to launching?

1728
02:42:54.98 --> 02:42:59.18
Did you ever get the call like, oh, it's go time?

1729
02:42:59.18 --> 02:43:02.86
Well, if you can imagine, there's 12 of us, 12,

1730
02:43:02.86 --> 02:43:06.70
we call them Victor Alert, 12 airplanes, hot cocked,

1731
02:43:06.70 --> 02:43:10.90
with a crypto code release from the president

1732
02:43:10.90 --> 02:43:14.38
to be able to arm that weapon and deliver it.

1733
02:43:14.38 --> 02:43:16.06
As you can imagine, nuclear weapons

1734
02:43:16.06 --> 02:43:18.58
are very closely controlled.

1735
02:43:18.58 --> 02:43:21.46
And rightfully so, I would say.

1736
02:43:21.46 --> 02:43:30.42
And I would sit on alert and I look up at that horn,

1737
02:43:30.42 --> 02:43:32.66
that klaxon.

1738
02:43:32.66 --> 02:43:39.90
And I thought, if that son of a bitch goes off,

1739
02:43:39.90 --> 02:43:42.46
the thing is that they didn't mess around with that.

1740
02:43:42.46 --> 02:43:45.62
It was either all out go or not go.

1741
02:43:45.62 --> 02:43:46.82
There wasn't any in between.

1742
02:43:46.82 --> 02:43:48.10
There was no drill or anything like this.

1743
02:43:48.10 --> 02:43:50.38
No, there was no, well, we'll drop a bomb and scare you

1744
02:43:50.38 --> 02:43:51.82
or something like that.

1745
02:43:51.82 --> 02:43:53.46
There wasn't any of that commitment.

1746
02:43:53.46 --> 02:43:54.98
And the whole thing was coordinated

1747
02:43:54.98 --> 02:43:59.26
from NATO to nuclear artillery right next to the FIBA

1748
02:43:59.26 --> 02:44:01.50
or right next to the Iron Curtain.

1749
02:44:01.50 --> 02:44:03.78
And then us were rolling stuff back.

1750
02:44:03.78 --> 02:44:08.34
And then the B-52s, they would come in for deeper penetration.

1751
02:44:08.34 --> 02:44:09.50
And it was all go.

1752
02:44:09.50 --> 02:44:13.18
And if they looked up there at that horn went off, I thought,

1753
02:44:13.18 --> 02:44:14.38
fuck.

1754
02:44:14.38 --> 02:44:16.58
There's no way to get back either.

1755
02:44:16.58 --> 02:44:18.22
It's all bullshit that you can come back.

1756
02:44:18.22 --> 02:44:19.94
But what am I going to come back to?

1757
02:44:19.94 --> 02:44:21.38
Yeah, and you know that, right?

1758
02:44:21.38 --> 02:44:22.66
I mean, you know if you launch on that thing,

1759
02:44:22.66 --> 02:44:24.02
that's the end of the world.

1760
02:44:24.02 --> 02:44:26.26
Like when we were in England sitting the word,

1761
02:44:26.26 --> 02:44:28.54
we were a nuclear delivery thing.

1762
02:44:28.54 --> 02:44:31.94
We had 12 active lines, 12.

1763
02:44:31.94 --> 02:44:36.18
They were in England when we were home for that 30 days.

1764
02:44:36.18 --> 02:44:39.22
And you know that if this thing started,

1765
02:44:39.22 --> 02:44:41.62
that that's a primary target.

1766
02:44:41.62 --> 02:44:43.86
And there's probably only 12 guys.

1767
02:44:43.86 --> 02:44:45.18
If this thing ever kicked off, there's

1768
02:44:45.18 --> 02:44:48.74
going to be 12 individuals at Lake and Heath Air Base

1769
02:44:48.74 --> 02:44:49.78
that are going to be alive.

1770
02:44:49.78 --> 02:44:51.94
Everybody else is going to be dying.

1771
02:44:51.94 --> 02:44:55.10
So you take off with an armed thermonuclear weapon.

1772
02:44:55.10 --> 02:44:56.70
And then you review them.

1773
02:44:56.70 --> 02:44:58.90
Everything that you know and love, your family,

1774
02:44:58.90 --> 02:45:03.10
your friends, everything disappears in a nuclear cloud.

1775
02:45:03.10 --> 02:45:07.34
And you often wonder, I got that son of a bitch.

1776
02:45:07.34 --> 02:45:10.42
It's in my centerline pylon and I'm really pissed off.

1777
02:45:13.82 --> 02:45:16.82
So we thought, well, we'd go upwind and bail out

1778
02:45:16.82 --> 02:45:21.82
over some Norwegian shored climb in a cave and wait

1779
02:45:21.82 --> 02:45:24.58
until all the radiation went away or whatever you can

1780
02:45:24.58 --> 02:45:26.38
visualize or something like that.

1781
02:45:26.38 --> 02:45:29.82
However, I lost more comrades in the Cold War

1782
02:45:29.82 --> 02:45:31.34
than I did in the Vietnam War.

1783
02:45:31.34 --> 02:45:35.34
From accidents, training accidents?

1784
02:45:35.34 --> 02:45:37.10
Or from what?

1785
02:45:37.10 --> 02:45:41.10
Well, a lot of it was highly classified.

1786
02:45:41.10 --> 02:45:43.54
The Gary Powers thing, the reconnaissance

1787
02:45:43.54 --> 02:45:46.78
and the RB47s did.

1788
02:45:46.78 --> 02:45:49.54
And there was a lot of other clandestine things

1789
02:45:49.54 --> 02:45:53.50
that even today they know nothing about.

1790
02:45:53.50 --> 02:45:54.78
Now, there's a lot of memorials.

1791
02:45:54.78 --> 02:45:57.54
This is one thing is my pet peeve right now,

1792
02:45:57.54 --> 02:46:00.98
is that there's Korea, all the wars.

1793
02:46:00.98 --> 02:46:03.58
Everybody has a monument there on the Mall.

1794
02:46:03.58 --> 02:46:07.30
And there's no monument about the Cold War.

1795
02:46:07.30 --> 02:46:10.50
And of course, there wasn't any battle line

1796
02:46:10.50 --> 02:46:13.06
and there wasn't any casualty report and stuff.

1797
02:46:13.06 --> 02:46:15.30
It's all classified and stuff.

1798
02:46:15.30 --> 02:46:17.10
And we won that damn thing.

1799
02:46:17.10 --> 02:46:17.86
We really did.

1800
02:46:17.86 --> 02:46:19.34
We won it.

1801
02:46:19.34 --> 02:46:21.50
And I can always say that I got shot down twice

1802
02:46:21.50 --> 02:46:24.62
once in the Cold War, the one that mattered

1803
02:46:24.62 --> 02:46:26.58
and then the Vietnam War.

1804
02:46:26.58 --> 02:46:28.66
Yeah, because you had another ejection.

1805
02:46:28.66 --> 02:46:29.34
Right.

1806
02:46:29.34 --> 02:46:30.78
What happened on that ejection?

1807
02:46:34.42 --> 02:46:37.50
Well, the saying was, you know a lot of it.

1808
02:46:37.50 --> 02:46:40.90
And what happens if you have a nuclear weapon on your aircraft

1809
02:46:40.90 --> 02:46:44.66
and you eject or would you never fly with a nuke, a live nuke?

1810
02:46:44.66 --> 02:46:47.46
No, they would never.

1811
02:46:47.46 --> 02:46:50.30
The tactical air command, the strategic air command,

1812
02:46:50.30 --> 02:46:56.46
B-52, Chromedome's, I think they did fly with fully armed nukes

1813
02:46:56.46 --> 02:46:57.26
ready to go.

1814
02:46:57.26 --> 02:46:59.90
And I think they quit that after they dropped a couple of them

1815
02:46:59.90 --> 02:47:02.70
inadvertently.

1816
02:47:02.70 --> 02:47:05.58
Anyway, that was an embarrassing thing.

1817
02:47:05.58 --> 02:47:07.18
During my time, we never flew them.

1818
02:47:07.18 --> 02:47:08.66
We flew with the dummies.

1819
02:47:08.66 --> 02:47:16.66
We'd go out and drop them on the range to see the accuracy.

1820
02:47:16.66 --> 02:47:20.14
But if you're dropping a really powerful bomb,

1821
02:47:20.14 --> 02:47:25.10
the only thing we would do, we'd ride on the side of the bomb

1822
02:47:25.10 --> 02:47:29.54
in grease pencil, something like, I don't know,

1823
02:47:29.54 --> 02:47:35.54
who the Soviet Premiers were, whatever.

1824
02:47:35.54 --> 02:47:39.06
Because there was one thing, you come at 500 knots right

1825
02:47:39.06 --> 02:47:41.14
on the deck at 50 feet and you pickle it off.

1826
02:47:41.14 --> 02:47:44.74
And then you try to keep going and getting away as far as you

1827
02:47:44.74 --> 02:47:46.58
can.

1828
02:47:46.58 --> 02:47:49.82
And you put the thing on the side and it said, well,

1829
02:47:49.82 --> 02:47:53.14
he says, well, Uncle Ho, what an Uncle Ho.

1830
02:47:53.14 --> 02:47:54.18
What the hell was it?

1831
02:47:54.18 --> 02:47:56.22
Whatever the Soviet thing was.

1832
02:47:56.22 --> 02:47:58.30
He says, you got three choices.

1833
02:47:58.30 --> 02:48:00.54
You can either run for 37 seconds

1834
02:48:00.54 --> 02:48:03.26
or you can dig for 37 seconds.

1835
02:48:03.26 --> 02:48:05.74
And the third choice is you can do any combination

1836
02:48:05.74 --> 02:48:08.78
of either one you want.

1837
02:48:08.78 --> 02:48:11.74
That's kind of sick humor.

1838
02:48:11.74 --> 02:48:13.54
So how did you eject again?

1839
02:48:13.54 --> 02:48:14.70
Well, I was on a test hop.

1840
02:48:19.42 --> 02:48:22.26
Actually, in England, I got kind of tired of going out

1841
02:48:22.26 --> 02:48:24.18
to what we call the Marsh Gunnery Range

1842
02:48:24.18 --> 02:48:28.78
and dropping little BDU-33 blue bombs, practicing.

1843
02:48:28.78 --> 02:48:30.82
And I wanted something of the little,

1844
02:48:30.82 --> 02:48:33.54
because I was a maintenance guy, had an A&P license

1845
02:48:33.54 --> 02:48:35.14
and I don't like maintenance.

1846
02:48:35.14 --> 02:48:38.14
And so I was going to go over and do the Chief of Quality

1847
02:48:38.14 --> 02:48:40.10
Control Flight Test Maintenance Officer, which

1848
02:48:40.10 --> 02:48:41.86
is really a neat job.

1849
02:48:41.86 --> 02:48:45.90
Because we got to fly the airplanes without the pylons

1850
02:48:45.90 --> 02:48:47.10
and without the drop tanks.

1851
02:48:47.10 --> 02:48:51.02
And they were clean and they were really a lot of fun to fly.

1852
02:48:51.02 --> 02:48:55.10
And the missions were short and very demanding.

1853
02:48:55.10 --> 02:48:59.62
And one problem, one thing, if you're a wing commander

1854
02:48:59.62 --> 02:49:03.66
and you want to get fired, we call them Victor lines, Victor

1855
02:49:03.66 --> 02:49:05.10
Alert lines.

1856
02:49:05.10 --> 02:49:10.42
And whether they're in commission or not is very important.

1857
02:49:10.42 --> 02:49:12.54
And if the wing commander wants to get fired,

1858
02:49:12.54 --> 02:49:14.90
he all he has to do is drop one of those lines

1859
02:49:14.90 --> 02:49:17.70
because of maintenance or some other thing.

1860
02:49:17.70 --> 02:49:19.38
Because when they check in every morning

1861
02:49:19.38 --> 02:49:22.78
down at whatever headquarters, all of his nukes

1862
02:49:22.78 --> 02:49:26.22
are ready to go and the pilots are briefed.

1863
02:49:26.22 --> 02:49:27.42
And then all of a sudden, there wasn't.

1864
02:49:27.42 --> 02:49:30.50
Now, the weather in England was really dog shit a lot of times.

1865
02:49:30.50 --> 02:49:34.06
And we were supposed to have VFR 500 and 5,000

1866
02:49:34.06 --> 02:49:38.22
overcasts and five miles visibility.

1867
02:49:38.22 --> 02:49:41.54
But it came up that there was a lot of maintenance

1868
02:49:41.54 --> 02:49:43.26
and the airplanes were coming out of maintenance.

1869
02:49:43.26 --> 02:49:46.50
And they were backed up because they couldn't get flight test.

1870
02:49:46.50 --> 02:49:48.34
And so it came to the point one day

1871
02:49:48.34 --> 02:49:51.18
that we were going to lose one of those nuklines.

1872
02:49:51.18 --> 02:49:51.94
Bad day.

1873
02:49:51.94 --> 02:49:54.22
Ooh, that was really bad.

1874
02:49:54.22 --> 02:50:00.02
And so in England, I think it was like 600 foot overcast

1875
02:50:00.02 --> 02:50:04.38
and drizzle and maybe two or three miles visibility.

1876
02:50:04.38 --> 02:50:08.70
And the vice wing commander, Colonel Herd, he come to me

1877
02:50:08.70 --> 02:50:10.74
and he says, hey, Dick, I know the weather's already bad,

1878
02:50:10.74 --> 02:50:15.74
but goddamn, we need this thing to replace it.

1879
02:50:15.74 --> 02:50:18.06
Or we're going to lose one of the Victor lines.

1880
02:50:18.06 --> 02:50:20.26
And of course, hell, I'm a combat guy.

1881
02:50:20.26 --> 02:50:26.22
I said, I can do anything, so go get them.

1882
02:50:26.22 --> 02:50:30.18
And so I taxi out and light the burner

1883
02:50:30.18 --> 02:50:31.94
and go down the runway, pull the nose up.

1884
02:50:31.94 --> 02:50:34.70
Now, it's really a fun thing because you can run

1885
02:50:34.70 --> 02:50:36.02
in full afterburner.

1886
02:50:36.02 --> 02:50:38.78
A full afterburner climb with an airplane without all the

1887
02:50:38.78 --> 02:50:39.58
ordnance on it.

1888
02:50:39.58 --> 02:50:44.02
Boy, it's really a sparkly little airplane.

1889
02:50:44.02 --> 02:50:47.26
And it's an afterburner climb to 40,000 feet.

1890
02:50:47.26 --> 02:50:51.42
And I break out on top over the North Sea at about 42,000 feet.

1891
02:50:51.42 --> 02:50:52.98
I can see.

1892
02:50:52.98 --> 02:50:57.10
So we have weather from 40,000 feet all the way to 600 feet

1893
02:50:57.10 --> 02:50:58.22
home.

1894
02:50:58.22 --> 02:51:02.30
And one of the tests is a negative G check.

1895
02:51:02.30 --> 02:51:05.10
And that's where some guys roll inverted.

1896
02:51:05.10 --> 02:51:09.30
I just pull up and then push it over to negative G

1897
02:51:09.30 --> 02:51:11.14
and all this stuff floats up.

1898
02:51:11.14 --> 02:51:15.86
And in the F-100, the canopy was designed in such an area.

1899
02:51:15.86 --> 02:51:19.06
Now, there's always dirt and crud and screwdrivers

1900
02:51:19.06 --> 02:51:21.22
and nuts and bolts and crap.

1901
02:51:21.22 --> 02:51:23.54
And it all ends up right over your head.

1902
02:51:23.54 --> 02:51:25.54
But just behind your head, and when

1903
02:51:25.54 --> 02:51:29.10
you come back to positive G, that it all falls.

1904
02:51:29.10 --> 02:51:33.46
And it falls together in all a very cleverly way

1905
02:51:33.46 --> 02:51:34.98
the physics of the airplane is.

1906
02:51:34.98 --> 02:51:37.42
And it goes right down the back of your neck.

1907
02:51:37.42 --> 02:51:38.62
Happens every time.

1908
02:51:38.62 --> 02:51:41.70
So I always had a collection of screwdrivers and wrenches

1909
02:51:41.70 --> 02:51:43.66
and stuff I found in the cockpit.

1910
02:51:43.66 --> 02:51:46.46
And I'd put it on the board and say, anybody, any mechanic up

1911
02:51:46.46 --> 02:51:50.14
there that would like to get it, they can come and claim their

1912
02:51:50.14 --> 02:51:50.50
ranch.

1913
02:51:50.50 --> 02:51:53.50
Of course, nobody ever claimed it and stuff.

1914
02:51:53.50 --> 02:51:55.54
So I did one.

1915
02:51:55.54 --> 02:51:56.78
I did one of those.

1916
02:51:56.78 --> 02:51:58.66
And when I came back to positive G,

1917
02:51:58.66 --> 02:52:00.74
I felt a horrible clunk.

1918
02:52:00.74 --> 02:52:03.42
I mean, a major clunk, just like the engine was loose or

1919
02:52:03.42 --> 02:52:04.62
something.

1920
02:52:04.62 --> 02:52:07.78
And I thought, god, what the hell is that?

1921
02:52:07.78 --> 02:52:11.54
And so this time, I got a lot more speed, pulled the nose up

1922
02:52:11.54 --> 02:52:14.06
really heavy, and really jammed the stick forward.

1923
02:52:14.06 --> 02:52:16.66
And sure enough, there was another big shift of weight.

1924
02:52:16.66 --> 02:52:18.70
It seems like right behind me.

1925
02:52:18.70 --> 02:52:23.70
Only this time, when I came back to positive G, the 42 PSI

1926
02:52:23.70 --> 02:52:28.06
normal operating position of the oil pressure went from there

1927
02:52:28.06 --> 02:52:33.70
to zero in a bat of an eye clunk.

1928
02:52:33.70 --> 02:52:37.74
And so now I had this big, huge clunk like the engine was

1929
02:52:37.74 --> 02:52:38.66
loose.

1930
02:52:38.66 --> 02:52:42.94
And I thought, well, maybe it pulled a wire loose because the

1931
02:52:42.94 --> 02:52:47.46
engine was running fine, that it had zero oil pressure.

1932
02:52:47.46 --> 02:52:53.86
Another thing, too, usually if you have a broken oil line,

1933
02:52:53.86 --> 02:52:57.66
the oil pressure will just kind of bounce around a little bit

1934
02:52:57.66 --> 02:53:00.14
and slowly decay.

1935
02:53:00.14 --> 02:53:04.26
But to go to absolute zero and then sprake it at the bat of

1936
02:53:04.26 --> 02:53:06.42
an eye, just bang zero.

1937
02:53:06.42 --> 02:53:09.02
And that's not normal.

1938
02:53:09.02 --> 02:53:14.86
And of course, you want to think it's not real serious

1939
02:53:14.86 --> 02:53:18.10
because where you are, and you finally think, I'm out over the

1940
02:53:18.10 --> 02:53:19.78
North Sea.

1941
02:53:19.78 --> 02:53:24.42
There's weather all the way to 600 feet at home.

1942
02:53:24.42 --> 02:53:27.30
And I says, OK.

1943
02:53:27.30 --> 02:53:32.46
So I practiced, I have to call Mayday.

1944
02:53:32.46 --> 02:53:34.46
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

1945
02:53:34.46 --> 02:53:35.66
It's a ring dub 2-1.

1946
02:53:35.66 --> 02:53:36.62
That's call sign.

1947
02:53:36.62 --> 02:53:37.54
Ring dub 2-1.

1948
02:53:37.54 --> 02:53:38.50
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

1949
02:53:38.50 --> 02:53:40.74
Where I am and what my problem is.

1950
02:53:40.74 --> 02:53:43.90
So I practiced a couple of times so I can get my really

1951
02:53:43.90 --> 02:53:46.94
cool Chuck Yeager voice.

1952
02:53:46.94 --> 02:53:48.58
And it took a while, too.

1953
02:53:48.58 --> 02:53:50.70
Because the first time I tried it in my headset, it didn't

1954
02:53:50.70 --> 02:53:52.18
sound very good.

1955
02:53:52.18 --> 02:53:53.50
So I got it really cool.

1956
02:53:55.82 --> 02:53:59.94
And one of the procedures is if you have zero oil pressure,

1957
02:53:59.94 --> 02:54:02.42
you don't want to jockey the engine back and forth.

1958
02:54:02.42 --> 02:54:04.42
You don't want to set the power.

1959
02:54:04.42 --> 02:54:06.78
And that means it'll run longer.

1960
02:54:06.78 --> 02:54:10.42
So I knew that I needed about 83% on final approach.

1961
02:54:10.42 --> 02:54:12.86
And an extra 20 knots to get level.

1962
02:54:12.86 --> 02:54:17.66
Because the F100 did not have a 0, 0 seat.

1963
02:54:17.66 --> 02:54:19.98
I think it was, but you had to get level.

1964
02:54:19.98 --> 02:54:24.10
If you were descending, you had no chance of making it.

1965
02:54:24.10 --> 02:54:26.94
And that extra 20 knots would get you level.

1966
02:54:26.94 --> 02:54:29.62
OK, half flaps, 83%.

1967
02:54:29.62 --> 02:54:32.74
And start down into the Merc.

1968
02:54:32.74 --> 02:54:36.14
And they had to vector me around a little bit for

1969
02:54:36.14 --> 02:54:38.06
identification back in those days.

1970
02:54:38.06 --> 02:54:41.30
Anyway, it took an extended period of time.

1971
02:54:41.30 --> 02:54:44.18
And I was telling them, I finally got on the GCA

1972
02:54:44.18 --> 02:54:45.82
controller.

1973
02:54:45.82 --> 02:54:50.58
And I says, look, give me transmission brakes.

1974
02:54:50.58 --> 02:54:53.62
Tell me you're on glide path, turn left, whatever the

1975
02:54:53.62 --> 02:54:54.30
dialogue is.

1976
02:54:54.30 --> 02:54:56.74
But give me transmission brakes in case something happens

1977
02:54:56.74 --> 02:54:58.58
in all that I can call you.

1978
02:54:58.58 --> 02:55:02.34
And of course, the GCA controllers, when they start

1979
02:55:02.34 --> 02:55:06.22
giving the instructions, they just clamp down on the

1980
02:55:06.22 --> 02:55:07.42
transmitter.

1981
02:55:07.42 --> 02:55:11.50
And so therefore, nobody heard anything at home when I was

1982
02:55:11.50 --> 02:55:12.62
on final approach.

1983
02:55:12.62 --> 02:55:15.22
Anyway, it kind of got a short, and I was really proud of

1984
02:55:15.22 --> 02:55:17.46
myself, a final intercept, glide path.

1985
02:55:17.46 --> 02:55:19.10
I lowered the nose.

1986
02:55:19.10 --> 02:55:19.86
Lowered the nose.

1987
02:55:19.86 --> 02:55:21.66
A half flaps had to gear down.

1988
02:55:21.66 --> 02:55:23.58
And hey, 83% was perfect.

1989
02:55:23.58 --> 02:55:25.18
They never jocked the engine at all.

1990
02:55:25.18 --> 02:55:27.14
This is really cool.

1991
02:55:27.14 --> 02:55:29.70
And I'm coming down in there, giving me the dialogue about

1992
02:55:29.70 --> 02:55:33.38
left and right on glide path and so forth.

1993
02:55:33.38 --> 02:55:35.34
And I just started to break out.

1994
02:55:35.34 --> 02:55:38.38
I couldn't see the runway, but I could start to see down a

1995
02:55:38.38 --> 02:55:40.10
little bit.

1996
02:55:40.10 --> 02:55:44.02
And I was thinking about, well, I'm rolling out of the

1997
02:55:44.02 --> 02:55:46.14
runway, and how am I going to write this thing up?

1998
02:55:46.14 --> 02:55:49.06
And so forth.

1999
02:55:49.06 --> 02:55:52.70
So then there was a grinding noise.

2000
02:55:52.70 --> 02:55:56.58
The intensity grew more and more.

2001
02:55:56.58 --> 02:56:00.46
And then it grew louder and louder and louder.

2002
02:56:00.46 --> 02:56:02.70
And then there was a huge explosion.

2003
02:56:02.70 --> 02:56:04.42
That's a compressor stalls.

2004
02:56:04.42 --> 02:56:07.14
And when a compressor stalls, then it shoots fire out both

2005
02:56:07.14 --> 02:56:08.26
ends of the airplane.

2006
02:56:08.26 --> 02:56:12.02
So there's this grinding and this huge bang and fire

2007
02:56:12.02 --> 02:56:13.14
shooting out in the front.

2008
02:56:13.14 --> 02:56:16.86
Dirt comes up in your face.

2009
02:56:16.86 --> 02:56:19.46
And now I'm looking for the, I call it the small corner of

2010
02:56:19.46 --> 02:56:20.70
time.

2011
02:56:20.70 --> 02:56:23.62
There's a small corner of time from here, just a couple of

2012
02:56:23.62 --> 02:56:24.70
seconds.

2013
02:56:24.70 --> 02:56:27.26
That corner of time, I can survive.

2014
02:56:27.26 --> 02:56:30.14
And if I'm outside of that, the ejection won't work.

2015
02:56:30.14 --> 02:56:32.62
That may not have hit the ground before.

2016
02:56:32.62 --> 02:56:37.42
And so to use every bit of that extra 20 knots that you have

2017
02:56:37.42 --> 02:56:42.34
on board to level off and eject, and maybe that the

2018
02:56:42.34 --> 02:56:43.82
parachute will open in time.

2019
02:56:46.50 --> 02:56:48.02
And so I did.

2020
02:56:48.02 --> 02:56:50.02
And I leveled off.

2021
02:56:50.02 --> 02:56:52.34
But then I looked down and there was a little town called

2022
02:56:52.34 --> 02:56:54.46
Brandon, right on the final approach.

2023
02:56:54.46 --> 02:56:58.82
And I could see the town right in front of me.

2024
02:56:58.82 --> 02:57:01.54
And I knew that if I banked the airplane, that it would

2025
02:57:01.54 --> 02:57:04.30
probably just bank and then ride itself and still go

2026
02:57:04.30 --> 02:57:05.50
into the town.

2027
02:57:05.50 --> 02:57:07.58
So this happened in just a couple of seconds.

2028
02:57:07.58 --> 02:57:10.46
I'm slowing down, coming back on the stick to slow down to

2029
02:57:10.46 --> 02:57:12.66
get in that small corner of time.

2030
02:57:12.66 --> 02:57:13.70
And I trim it.

2031
02:57:13.70 --> 02:57:15.30
Got the left trim going.

2032
02:57:15.30 --> 02:57:18.42
And reached down with my left hand and grabbed the handle

2033
02:57:18.42 --> 02:57:20.62
and pulled it up.

2034
02:57:20.62 --> 02:57:21.94
Whoops.

2035
02:57:21.94 --> 02:57:23.90
And pulled it up and it blew the canopy off.

2036
02:57:23.90 --> 02:57:26.66
And then immediately squeezed both tritters.

2037
02:57:26.66 --> 02:57:30.46
And knowing where that jet is going to be in a handful of

2038
02:57:30.46 --> 02:57:33.54
time, that is the most wonderful, smoothest

2039
02:57:33.54 --> 02:57:35.58
experience you'll ever have.

2040
02:57:35.58 --> 02:57:37.86
Is that ride up and out of that thing.

2041
02:57:37.86 --> 02:57:41.46
But the time compression is really interesting because as

2042
02:57:41.46 --> 02:57:45.14
the airplane was going up the rails, I thought there's going

2043
02:57:45.14 --> 02:57:47.46
to be an accident board.

2044
02:57:47.46 --> 02:57:49.38
And they're going to go through all the paperwork.

2045
02:57:49.38 --> 02:57:51.14
And I'm going to have to remember what I did for the

2046
02:57:51.14 --> 02:57:52.74
last three days when I drank.

2047
02:57:52.74 --> 02:57:54.18
And I'm thinking about all that stuff.

2048
02:57:54.18 --> 02:57:56.18
Going up the ejection rails.

2049
02:57:56.18 --> 02:58:00.50
And then I thought, my god, I had to put the colonel's name

2050
02:58:00.50 --> 02:58:01.02
on there.

2051
02:58:01.02 --> 02:58:01.98
And it's Herd.

2052
02:58:01.98 --> 02:58:03.22
Colonel Herd.

2053
02:58:03.22 --> 02:58:04.78
Is it H-E-R-D?

2054
02:58:04.78 --> 02:58:06.90
And I misspelled it.

2055
02:58:06.90 --> 02:58:09.14
And I thought, god, everybody in the whole world is going to

2056
02:58:09.14 --> 02:58:10.54
see that thing.

2057
02:58:10.54 --> 02:58:14.70
And on this paper, the flight plan or the clearance thing,

2058
02:58:14.70 --> 02:58:16.30
and I misspelled the guy's name.

2059
02:58:16.30 --> 02:58:17.50
How horrible.

2060
02:58:17.50 --> 02:58:18.82
That's all going through your mind.

2061
02:58:18.82 --> 02:58:21.66
See, it's still going up the rails.

2062
02:58:21.66 --> 02:58:25.22
And then the parachute opens.

2063
02:58:25.22 --> 02:58:32.50
And you can feel it as the canopy starts to open.

2064
02:58:32.50 --> 02:58:34.90
Not the shroud line.

2065
02:58:34.90 --> 02:58:35.50
Yeah, the right.

2066
02:58:35.50 --> 02:58:36.18
Not the risers.

2067
02:58:36.18 --> 02:58:38.22
But the shroud lines are all in there in their bundle.

2068
02:58:38.22 --> 02:58:41.74
And you can feel them coming off your back.

2069
02:58:41.74 --> 02:58:44.42
And then it opened.

2070
02:58:44.42 --> 02:58:45.94
And then it's opened.

2071
02:58:45.94 --> 02:58:47.10
And it happened so quick.

2072
02:58:47.10 --> 02:58:49.82
I looked straight between my legs, expecting just to look

2073
02:58:49.82 --> 02:58:51.74
down right into the cockpit.

2074
02:58:51.74 --> 02:58:53.70
Of course, that was ridiculous.

2075
02:58:53.70 --> 02:58:57.26
And I looked around and off my left shoulder, I could see

2076
02:58:57.26 --> 02:58:58.34
the airplane.

2077
02:58:58.34 --> 02:58:59.58
And airplanes flying along.

2078
02:58:59.58 --> 02:59:01.98
And now I'm low enough I can see the runway.

2079
02:59:01.98 --> 02:59:04.34
And for all the work, the airplane was going to

2080
02:59:04.34 --> 02:59:07.42
frickin' land on the runway.

2081
02:59:07.42 --> 02:59:11.14
I thought, boy, they're going to get, I'm going to get

2082
02:59:11.14 --> 02:59:12.74
frowned at for this.

2083
02:59:12.74 --> 02:59:14.90
Jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.

2084
02:59:14.90 --> 02:59:16.14
It lands on the runway.

2085
02:59:16.14 --> 02:59:17.86
And I did it.

2086
02:59:17.86 --> 02:59:21.50
And then the next thing I know, I'm in the trees.

2087
02:59:21.50 --> 02:59:23.14
Parachute comes down through the trees.

2088
02:59:26.02 --> 02:59:29.66
If you're going to bail out, pine trees are very nice.

2089
02:59:29.66 --> 02:59:31.26
Kind of smaller pines.

2090
02:59:31.26 --> 02:59:32.94
Because they're interlacing.

2091
02:59:32.94 --> 02:59:33.86
You come down through them.

2092
02:59:33.86 --> 02:59:35.74
And they bend just right.

2093
02:59:35.74 --> 02:59:38.82
And by the time I got to the surface, I ended up stopping

2094
02:59:38.82 --> 02:59:43.62
about an inch or two above the beautiful pine floor.

2095
02:59:43.62 --> 02:59:46.78
And then with another shake, then the parachute canopy

2096
02:59:46.78 --> 02:59:49.82
came down around my...

2097
02:59:49.82 --> 02:59:52.14
OK, now I'm right out of Vietnam, see.

2098
02:59:52.14 --> 02:59:54.14
And I've ejected.

2099
02:59:54.14 --> 02:59:57.82
And you're in the E&E training.

2100
02:59:57.82 --> 03:00:00.82
For a whole year, I've been training for escape and evasion.

2101
03:00:00.82 --> 03:00:01.86
Hide the parachute.

2102
03:00:01.86 --> 03:00:02.50
Get the radio.

2103
03:00:02.50 --> 03:00:03.82
Get that damn beeper off.

2104
03:00:03.82 --> 03:00:05.30
Which didn't work this time either.

2105
03:00:05.30 --> 03:00:08.10
The parachute beeper.

2106
03:00:08.10 --> 03:00:09.42
And I got to get the radio out.

2107
03:00:09.42 --> 03:00:13.50
But in England, we don't have the double radios and stuff.

2108
03:00:13.50 --> 03:00:16.46
And so right over there, there was an English guy in a

2109
03:00:16.46 --> 03:00:17.46
Koten tie.

2110
03:00:17.46 --> 03:00:20.06
He was out trimming the Queen's forest.

2111
03:00:20.06 --> 03:00:21.82
And his eyes were about big of saucers.

2112
03:00:21.82 --> 03:00:23.86
And he was looking, his eyes opened.

2113
03:00:23.86 --> 03:00:25.86
Of course, I come down and wear a nuclear alert.

2114
03:00:25.86 --> 03:00:27.02
And I have a gold visor on.

2115
03:00:27.02 --> 03:00:29.98
So here this guy comes crashing down through the trees.

2116
03:00:29.98 --> 03:00:32.46
And he said he heard the explosion.

2117
03:00:32.46 --> 03:00:33.78
He heard the seat come down.

2118
03:00:33.78 --> 03:00:35.38
And the canopy come down.

2119
03:00:35.38 --> 03:00:38.18
And then this guy's spacecraft with a golden helmet

2120
03:00:38.18 --> 03:00:39.94
come down right in front of him, basically.

2121
03:00:39.94 --> 03:00:44.10
And he's starting to back away.

2122
03:00:44.10 --> 03:00:45.50
I said, no, no, I need your help.

2123
03:00:45.50 --> 03:00:47.26
I need your help.

2124
03:00:47.26 --> 03:00:50.70
And yeah, come on.

2125
03:00:50.70 --> 03:00:52.10
Then I took the helmet off.

2126
03:00:52.10 --> 03:00:53.86
And then I thought, God, I got to call somebody.

2127
03:00:53.86 --> 03:00:57.54
My radios are normally in my vest in Vietnam.

2128
03:00:57.54 --> 03:00:59.06
But now they're in the damn seat kit.

2129
03:00:59.06 --> 03:01:00.74
One radio in the seat kit.

2130
03:01:00.74 --> 03:01:05.18
So the only way to get to it is to pull that handle on your

2131
03:01:05.18 --> 03:01:06.78
seat kit that you sit on.

2132
03:01:06.78 --> 03:01:09.86
It's got your raft and survival gear and stuff in there.

2133
03:01:09.86 --> 03:01:11.22
So I pulled the handle.

2134
03:01:11.22 --> 03:01:13.10
And a CO2 cartridge comes off.

2135
03:01:13.10 --> 03:01:18.26
And this yellow raft emerges out and making all this goddamn

2136
03:01:18.26 --> 03:01:20.14
noise right in front of this guy.

2137
03:01:20.14 --> 03:01:21.94
And he turns around and starts running away.

2138
03:01:21.94 --> 03:01:28.06
Where'd the plane hit?

2139
03:01:28.06 --> 03:01:29.86
The airplane came.

2140
03:01:29.86 --> 03:01:31.82
And it started a very left turn.

2141
03:01:31.82 --> 03:01:33.22
And it just missed the town.

2142
03:01:33.22 --> 03:01:35.18
It hit right in front of the plane.

2143
03:01:35.18 --> 03:01:36.82
It just missed the town.

2144
03:01:36.82 --> 03:01:39.86
It hit right beside Brandon, right across the road.

2145
03:01:39.86 --> 03:01:40.90
It didn't hurt anybody.

2146
03:01:40.90 --> 03:01:44.22
But it, you know, the typical fireball and stuff that

2147
03:01:44.22 --> 03:01:45.30
comes down.

2148
03:01:45.30 --> 03:01:47.86
And as I was pulling back, I says, it just blew it.

2149
03:01:47.86 --> 03:01:48.50
I'm getting out.

2150
03:01:48.50 --> 03:01:50.62
Now, nobody heard me.

2151
03:01:50.62 --> 03:01:53.70
Now, the colonel that was coming back from across country,

2152
03:01:53.70 --> 03:01:55.26
he heard me.

2153
03:01:55.26 --> 03:01:59.22
He's the only one that heard my call.

2154
03:01:59.22 --> 03:02:02.98
And so anyway, I took the helmet off.

2155
03:02:02.98 --> 03:02:03.98
And I ran and got him.

2156
03:02:03.98 --> 03:02:05.26
And I said, hey, I need your help.

2157
03:02:05.26 --> 03:02:07.90
And I brought him back.

2158
03:02:07.90 --> 03:02:11.06
And what the hell?

2159
03:02:11.06 --> 03:02:11.54
Oh, yeah.

2160
03:02:11.54 --> 03:02:14.62
Then I got down to the kit and opened it up and found the

2161
03:02:14.62 --> 03:02:17.38
radio and opened it up and turned it on.

2162
03:02:17.38 --> 03:02:18.78
And I called.

2163
03:02:21.82 --> 03:02:23.38
I made a radio call.

2164
03:02:23.38 --> 03:02:26.62
And for the time that it blew up, it was only about 93

2165
03:02:26.62 --> 03:02:30.58
seconds, that whole time that happened.

2166
03:02:30.58 --> 03:02:31.50
OK.

2167
03:02:31.50 --> 03:02:34.02
Now, I got a really good drinking buddy.

2168
03:02:34.02 --> 03:02:41.46
And he is the airfield support helicopter.

2169
03:02:41.46 --> 03:02:43.78
And it's called Pedro.

2170
03:02:43.78 --> 03:02:47.66
And Pedro is HH 43 and has intermission rotors.

2171
03:02:47.66 --> 03:02:51.42
And their whole mission is to have the Sputnik that hangs.

2172
03:02:51.42 --> 03:02:55.14
It's a big ball, firefighting stuff.

2173
03:02:55.14 --> 03:02:57.30
It's about as big as this table.

2174
03:02:57.30 --> 03:02:59.30
It's just fear.

2175
03:02:59.30 --> 03:03:04.26
And the whole thing is set up so the firefighters and their

2176
03:03:04.26 --> 03:03:09.22
aluminum suits, and there's a big fireball and burning and

2177
03:03:09.22 --> 03:03:11.46
the pilots inside, they've got to go rescue them.

2178
03:03:11.46 --> 03:03:13.30
So the rotor worst pushes it away.

2179
03:03:13.30 --> 03:03:16.46
And they take this Sputnik with their firefighting thing.

2180
03:03:16.46 --> 03:03:18.42
And they fight their way through the flames.

2181
03:03:18.42 --> 03:03:19.62
And they get in the cockpit.

2182
03:03:19.62 --> 03:03:21.90
And they pull the pilot out.

2183
03:03:21.90 --> 03:03:25.18
That's the whole thing.

2184
03:03:25.18 --> 03:03:30.30
And so now I didn't know about this, but nobody heard me

2185
03:03:30.30 --> 03:03:32.06
say that I was getting out.

2186
03:03:32.06 --> 03:03:36.50
And the end of the runway, the mobile controller.

2187
03:03:36.50 --> 03:03:38.22
His name was Jeff Coe.

2188
03:03:38.22 --> 03:03:39.86
Yeah.

2189
03:03:39.86 --> 03:03:43.42
In fact, he was a prisoner of war.

2190
03:03:43.42 --> 03:03:44.22
Yeah, I think he was.

2191
03:03:44.22 --> 03:03:45.70
I could be wrong about that.

2192
03:03:45.70 --> 03:03:47.62
But anyway, he said he's a mobile controller.

2193
03:03:47.62 --> 03:03:49.74
And so he starts screaming on the radio.

2194
03:03:49.74 --> 03:03:51.38
He says, get out there quick.

2195
03:03:51.38 --> 03:03:52.58
No shoot, no shoot.

2196
03:03:52.58 --> 03:03:53.42
There is no shoot.

2197
03:03:53.42 --> 03:03:54.42
I didn't see a shoot.

2198
03:03:54.42 --> 03:03:55.98
Get out there quick.

2199
03:03:55.98 --> 03:03:57.42
And he's screaming at the paid room.

2200
03:03:57.42 --> 03:03:58.58
And so the guy lifts off.

2201
03:03:58.58 --> 03:04:00.54
And he's in the helicopter.

2202
03:04:00.54 --> 03:04:02.94
And he's heading for the fireball out there.

2203
03:04:02.94 --> 03:04:04.98
It's going out.

2204
03:04:04.98 --> 03:04:08.06
And he keeps saying, the only thing that he saw was a landing

2205
03:04:08.06 --> 03:04:13.66
light came out of the weather and crashed into a big fireball.

2206
03:04:13.66 --> 03:04:18.06
So the guy, my buddy in the paid row, a helicopter, he's

2207
03:04:18.06 --> 03:04:18.46
out there.

2208
03:04:18.46 --> 03:04:19.10
He's going.

2209
03:04:19.10 --> 03:04:20.30
The guy's screaming at him.

2210
03:04:20.30 --> 03:04:21.22
He get out there quick.

2211
03:04:21.22 --> 03:04:22.82
And so he's going fast.

2212
03:04:22.82 --> 03:04:25.06
And for some reason, he thought he could get there

2213
03:04:25.06 --> 03:04:29.30
quicker if he pickled off that spudnik that he's hanging

2214
03:04:29.30 --> 03:04:29.70
below it.

2215
03:04:29.70 --> 03:04:30.98
So he pickled it off.

2216
03:04:30.98 --> 03:04:33.10
See?

2217
03:04:33.10 --> 03:04:35.94
Crash halfway to the wreck site.

2218
03:04:35.94 --> 03:04:38.78
And so he's coming around.

2219
03:04:38.78 --> 03:04:39.90
He's circling the wreck site.

2220
03:04:39.90 --> 03:04:45.58
It's all you see is a big, typical, crash site with

2221
03:04:45.58 --> 03:04:48.78
debris and fireball and stuff.

2222
03:04:48.78 --> 03:04:50.18
And he's thinking, oh, shut.

2223
03:04:50.18 --> 03:04:53.02
Now, that's Rutan out there, my best friend.

2224
03:04:53.02 --> 03:04:54.38
It's really terrible.

2225
03:04:54.38 --> 03:04:58.86
And then he gets out there in a minute or 93 seconds or

2226
03:04:58.86 --> 03:04:59.90
something.

2227
03:04:59.90 --> 03:05:02.34
I call him on the radio.

2228
03:05:02.34 --> 03:05:04.54
I says, hey, I'm down.

2229
03:05:04.54 --> 03:05:06.30
Come and get me.

2230
03:05:06.30 --> 03:05:07.86
Come and get me.

2231
03:05:07.86 --> 03:05:12.58
And so now his first thought, he's circling this fireball.

2232
03:05:12.58 --> 03:05:14.26
And he thinks that I'm in there, right?

2233
03:05:14.26 --> 03:05:15.10
Calling for help.

2234
03:05:15.10 --> 03:05:15.86
And I call him.

2235
03:05:15.86 --> 03:05:18.62
And I says, get your ass out here and get me.

2236
03:05:18.62 --> 03:05:21.66
And then his whole thing, his whole training, everything

2237
03:05:21.66 --> 03:05:24.30
he's trained up for was that Spudnik thing.

2238
03:05:24.30 --> 03:05:26.38
And there's the fire in a classic situation.

2239
03:05:26.38 --> 03:05:29.74
And they're going to land and push the fire out of the way.

2240
03:05:29.74 --> 03:05:30.90
But he pickled it off.

2241
03:05:30.90 --> 03:05:32.06
And it's not there.

2242
03:05:32.06 --> 03:05:33.38
And he's heart sick.

2243
03:05:33.38 --> 03:05:35.18
He says, my god, I've screwed up.

2244
03:05:35.18 --> 03:05:37.42
Now, Rutan's going to burn alive down there.

2245
03:05:37.42 --> 03:05:38.42
And I could have saved him.

2246
03:05:38.42 --> 03:05:41.30
That's really bad.

2247
03:05:41.30 --> 03:05:46.06
And then he starts to realize, wait a minute.

2248
03:05:46.06 --> 03:05:50.30
There's no way that somebody can be alive in that thing down

2249
03:05:50.30 --> 03:05:51.90
there.

2250
03:05:51.90 --> 03:05:52.82
And so he calls.

2251
03:05:52.82 --> 03:05:56.74
And he says, he calls my name.

2252
03:05:56.74 --> 03:05:59.10
He says, Dick, is that you?

2253
03:05:59.10 --> 03:06:02.14
I says, yeah, get your ass out here and get me.

2254
03:06:02.14 --> 03:06:06.14
Thinking of Vietnam, I need to get rescued really quick.

2255
03:06:06.14 --> 03:06:09.38
And it's really interesting, this plaintive voice

2256
03:06:09.38 --> 03:06:12.38
that he said, he says, where are you?

2257
03:06:12.38 --> 03:06:14.70
I says, I bail out about a mile short.

2258
03:06:14.70 --> 03:06:17.18
He says, you bailed out?

2259
03:06:17.18 --> 03:06:19.18
You ejected?

2260
03:06:19.18 --> 03:06:22.26
And then you can understand the metamorphosis of emotion

2261
03:06:22.26 --> 03:06:24.22
that he's going through.

2262
03:06:24.22 --> 03:06:26.06
From the guy that's burning down there.

2263
03:06:26.06 --> 03:06:29.18
And I just jettisoned my firefighting equipment.

2264
03:06:29.18 --> 03:06:30.02
And now he's burning.

2265
03:06:30.02 --> 03:06:30.86
And he's calling me.

2266
03:06:30.86 --> 03:06:32.70
And I can't get to him.

2267
03:06:32.70 --> 03:06:35.14
And then the adulation of feeling, oh, he bailed out.

2268
03:06:35.14 --> 03:06:36.90
And he's OK.

2269
03:06:36.90 --> 03:06:39.78
And I says, yeah, get your ass out here and get me.

2270
03:06:39.78 --> 03:06:43.38
And so then he did come out and get me.

2271
03:06:43.38 --> 03:06:45.14
Of course, here you bail out, see.

2272
03:06:45.14 --> 03:06:47.14
And so there's the officers club.

2273
03:06:47.14 --> 03:06:50.22
And you've got to tell the story about everything.

2274
03:06:50.22 --> 03:06:55.34
And my squadron commander, Jake Engel, he comes up.

2275
03:06:55.34 --> 03:06:57.98
And he says, hey, he says, tell me.

2276
03:06:57.98 --> 03:06:59.10
I got a couple of questions.

2277
03:06:59.10 --> 03:07:02.30
He says, what were the indications?

2278
03:07:02.30 --> 03:07:04.74
You know, did the, you know, what?

2279
03:07:04.74 --> 03:07:07.34
We have a panel full of a lot of faults.

2280
03:07:07.34 --> 03:07:09.30
And a big master caution light comes on.

2281
03:07:09.30 --> 03:07:15.26
And then he says, oh, which one of those lights came on?

2282
03:07:15.26 --> 03:07:17.46
I thought, fuck.

2283
03:07:17.46 --> 03:07:18.10
You kidding me?

2284
03:07:18.10 --> 03:07:21.06
The only thing I saw was a big red master caution light

2285
03:07:21.06 --> 03:07:24.10
that was accentuated and confirmed by the fact

2286
03:07:24.10 --> 03:07:29.38
that there was a grinding noise and fire shot out the front.

2287
03:07:29.38 --> 03:07:32.98
And then that's all I remember, Jake.

2288
03:07:32.98 --> 03:07:36.82
And then I kept thinking about seeing that airplane flying off.

2289
03:07:36.82 --> 03:07:38.74
You know, there's a big pole sticking out of the canopy.

2290
03:07:38.74 --> 03:07:39.54
And I could see it.

2291
03:07:39.54 --> 03:07:41.46
And I could see the runway now.

2292
03:07:41.46 --> 03:07:44.02
And that horrible feeling.

2293
03:07:44.02 --> 03:07:45.82
And so I couldn't sleep that night.

2294
03:07:45.82 --> 03:07:47.34
So about 3 o'clock in the morning,

2295
03:07:47.34 --> 03:07:48.74
I called maintenance control.

2296
03:07:48.74 --> 03:07:51.42
I said, hey, you guys got the engine yet?

2297
03:07:54.26 --> 03:07:56.02
And they says, yeah, they just brought it in.

2298
03:07:56.02 --> 03:07:58.14
And it's in Hangar so-and-so.

2299
03:07:58.14 --> 03:07:59.30
It's on a dolly.

2300
03:07:59.30 --> 03:08:03.22
You know, you can go and look at it if you want to.

2301
03:08:03.22 --> 03:08:07.34
And in jet engines, it usually crushes part of the intake

2302
03:08:07.34 --> 03:08:11.10
or the compressor blades that spin.

2303
03:08:11.10 --> 03:08:14.30
As they're spinning, they can tell what the RPM was

2304
03:08:14.30 --> 03:08:15.10
that they crush.

2305
03:08:15.10 --> 03:08:16.38
And then they're bent back.

2306
03:08:16.38 --> 03:08:18.06
And they can have a pretty good idea of what

2307
03:08:18.06 --> 03:08:21.06
the power of the engine was.

2308
03:08:21.06 --> 03:08:22.62
And so it was really eerie.

2309
03:08:22.62 --> 03:08:23.54
And I got in the car.

2310
03:08:23.54 --> 03:08:26.18
And I went down there to mission control.

2311
03:08:26.18 --> 03:08:27.66
There's nobody on the field.

2312
03:08:27.66 --> 03:08:29.66
It's kind of drizzly.

2313
03:08:29.66 --> 03:08:31.26
And there's the Hangar.

2314
03:08:31.26 --> 03:08:34.14
So I drive up, open the door.

2315
03:08:34.14 --> 03:08:36.38
And sure enough, I look over there.

2316
03:08:36.38 --> 03:08:37.58
And there's the engine.

2317
03:08:37.58 --> 03:08:39.22
It's on an engine stand.

2318
03:08:39.22 --> 03:08:43.22
And excuse me, the top of the fuselage is still there.

2319
03:08:43.22 --> 03:08:48.34
And then the tail is all burnt and whatever.

2320
03:08:48.34 --> 03:08:52.10
So I walk over there to the engine by the side.

2321
03:08:56.86 --> 03:09:00.34
And I know they can tell the power on the engine

2322
03:09:00.34 --> 03:09:02.22
by the bent blades.

2323
03:09:02.22 --> 03:09:04.14
And there's the face of it.

2324
03:09:04.14 --> 03:09:07.22
So all you do is walk around and look at that.

2325
03:09:07.22 --> 03:09:09.10
So I stopped there for a little bit.

2326
03:09:09.10 --> 03:09:12.82
And you safety, or you have a horrible accident rate,

2327
03:09:12.82 --> 03:09:14.94
for some reason.

2328
03:09:14.94 --> 03:09:16.82
A lot of accidents and stuff.

2329
03:09:16.82 --> 03:09:21.74
The old F-100 engine, it had problems with it.

2330
03:09:21.74 --> 03:09:26.58
And so I thought, boy, they were going to hang me for this.

2331
03:09:26.58 --> 03:09:28.86
The first thing to do on an accident rate

2332
03:09:28.86 --> 03:09:29.94
is they blame the pilot.

2333
03:09:29.94 --> 03:09:32.90
See, it's pilot error, everything.

2334
03:09:32.90 --> 03:09:34.42
And I took a deep breath and I thought,

2335
03:09:34.42 --> 03:09:37.06
I'm going to walk around and look at the front of this engine

2336
03:09:37.06 --> 03:09:38.26
on the intake.

2337
03:09:38.26 --> 03:09:38.94
And then I'll know.

2338
03:09:41.42 --> 03:09:44.78
And that may be the end of my flying, on my career.

2339
03:09:44.78 --> 03:09:48.54
I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane.

2340
03:09:48.54 --> 03:09:51.42
So I went around and looked at the face of the engine.

2341
03:09:51.42 --> 03:09:54.26
And the blades, it crushed the intake

2342
03:09:54.26 --> 03:09:56.46
into a kind of a D-section.

2343
03:09:56.46 --> 03:09:59.38
So all the blades were straight.

2344
03:09:59.38 --> 03:10:03.26
And the ones that were, which crushed the blades,

2345
03:10:03.26 --> 03:10:05.30
they weren't rotating like that.

2346
03:10:05.30 --> 03:10:07.58
They were crushed straight in like that.

2347
03:10:07.58 --> 03:10:08.54
Zero power.

2348
03:10:08.54 --> 03:10:10.18
Zero RPM.

2349
03:10:10.18 --> 03:10:12.98
Zero RPM at impact.

2350
03:10:12.98 --> 03:10:15.46
And I thought, god.

2351
03:10:15.46 --> 03:10:18.22
Maybe there was something wrong with the engine.

2352
03:10:18.22 --> 03:10:22.98
And with that, it went back and had a good night's sleep.

2353
03:10:22.98 --> 03:10:30.26
So you end up doing other jobs in the Air Force.

2354
03:10:30.26 --> 03:10:31.98
Like you already talked about, you went and he had to go

2355
03:10:31.98 --> 03:10:32.86
and get your degrees.

2356
03:10:32.86 --> 03:10:35.50
And she didn't have a college degree.

2357
03:10:35.50 --> 03:10:40.86
Eventually, you retire from the Air Force.

2358
03:10:40.86 --> 03:10:43.34
And then after you retired from the Air Force,

2359
03:10:43.34 --> 03:10:46.26
and I guess even before you retired for the Air Force,

2360
03:10:46.26 --> 03:10:47.90
you were kind of doing some stuff with your brother.

2361
03:10:47.90 --> 03:10:49.98
You were starting this kind of crazy test pilot.

2362
03:10:49.98 --> 03:10:52.54
You were flying these little homemade planes

2363
03:10:52.54 --> 03:10:53.78
that your brother was making.

2364
03:10:53.78 --> 03:10:56.78
I threw a couple of those before I retired.

2365
03:10:56.78 --> 03:11:03.98
But then the retirement thing had a big problem

2366
03:11:03.98 --> 03:11:05.58
with the Air Force at this time.

2367
03:11:05.58 --> 03:11:08.34
And it was in the 70s.

2368
03:11:08.34 --> 03:11:10.54
And the military, at least the Air Force,

2369
03:11:10.54 --> 03:11:13.30
was permeated with drugs.

2370
03:11:13.30 --> 03:11:16.78
All kinds of drug problems and stuff.

2371
03:11:16.78 --> 03:11:22.86
And so the husband of the wing commander says, hey, Dick,

2372
03:11:22.86 --> 03:11:25.30
go down and take over the field maintenance thing.

2373
03:11:25.30 --> 03:11:27.02
You're a maintenance guy.

2374
03:11:27.02 --> 03:11:29.78
And I'll make you a squadron commander of a maintenance

2375
03:11:29.78 --> 03:11:31.26
squadron.

2376
03:11:31.26 --> 03:11:34.62
So I got 420 maintenance people.

2377
03:11:34.62 --> 03:11:37.78
And we do engine overhauls and break overhauls and stuff,

2378
03:11:37.78 --> 03:11:41.98
not crew chief stuff, but just kind of field maintenance thing.

2379
03:11:41.98 --> 03:11:45.58
And it was impermeated with drugs.

2380
03:11:45.58 --> 03:11:49.66
A lot of drugs with the people.

2381
03:11:49.66 --> 03:11:53.10
And there was a smoker.

2382
03:11:53.10 --> 03:11:58.18
And I knew that smoking was bad for everybody, for anybody.

2383
03:11:58.18 --> 03:12:03.14
And there was one guy.

2384
03:12:03.14 --> 03:12:04.58
We were anti-smoking, see?

2385
03:12:04.58 --> 03:12:06.58
Maybe that was kind of unique, because everything

2386
03:12:06.58 --> 03:12:09.98
was built around cigarettes and alcohol, the social environment.

2387
03:12:09.98 --> 03:12:10.54
There was one guy.

2388
03:12:10.54 --> 03:12:11.46
His name was Al Munch.

2389
03:12:11.46 --> 03:12:13.42
And he was smoking all the time.

2390
03:12:13.42 --> 03:12:18.46
And we're in the club, and then we're talking and arguing.

2391
03:12:18.46 --> 03:12:20.94
Typical Friday night BS.

2392
03:12:20.94 --> 03:12:22.22
And I says, Al, look at that.

2393
03:12:22.22 --> 03:12:25.46
I says, look at the cigarettes.

2394
03:12:25.46 --> 03:12:27.34
It's got you.

2395
03:12:27.34 --> 03:12:29.38
He said, nah, I could give it up any time.

2396
03:12:29.38 --> 03:12:31.10
I have a big argument.

2397
03:12:31.10 --> 03:12:32.10
I said, I'll tell you what.

2398
03:12:32.10 --> 03:12:37.22
I said, here's $10 bill.

2399
03:12:37.22 --> 03:12:38.22
I put it down on the table.

2400
03:12:38.22 --> 03:12:41.50
He says, you can't go 20 minutes without a cigarette.

2401
03:12:41.50 --> 03:12:45.30
Oh, yeah, oh, God.

2402
03:12:45.30 --> 03:12:50.66
And so, and I knew he couldn't, because he's addicted to addicts.

2403
03:12:50.66 --> 03:12:53.78
Anyway, he was a big addict for nicotine.

2404
03:12:53.78 --> 03:12:56.18
And it wasn't more than six or eight minutes later

2405
03:12:56.18 --> 03:12:57.58
that he came back.

2406
03:12:57.58 --> 03:12:59.38
He had a whole lung full of smoke,

2407
03:12:59.38 --> 03:13:01.06
and he blew it in my face.

2408
03:13:01.06 --> 03:13:06.02
And he took the $5 bill, and he threw it on the ground.

2409
03:13:06.02 --> 03:13:08.46
So anyway, I had a maintenance squatter.

2410
03:13:08.46 --> 03:13:11.54
And I said, there's going to be no smoking in my orderly room

2411
03:13:11.54 --> 03:13:12.98
or any of the buildings.

2412
03:13:12.98 --> 03:13:15.98
Well, that didn't go over too well with a lot of people.

2413
03:13:15.98 --> 03:13:21.10
And another thing, I had a third of my troops were female.

2414
03:13:21.10 --> 03:13:24.78
Female maintenance people, really good.

2415
03:13:24.78 --> 03:13:31.14
And but they would lock them up in the WAF barracks at night.

2416
03:13:31.14 --> 03:13:35.46
And they had some big WAF sergeant would control the.

2417
03:13:35.46 --> 03:13:36.22
What's a WAF?

2418
03:13:36.22 --> 03:13:37.98
Oh, women in the Air Force.

2419
03:13:37.98 --> 03:13:40.98
Yeah, that's right, women in the Air Force.

2420
03:13:40.98 --> 03:13:42.86
Anyway, there was a big sergeant that

2421
03:13:42.86 --> 03:13:44.50
would control all these women.

2422
03:13:44.50 --> 03:13:46.70
And they'd lock them up at night.

2423
03:13:46.70 --> 03:13:50.14
And my other squatter, and he had all the crew chiefs,

2424
03:13:50.14 --> 03:13:54.62
and they would sneak in and play with my WAF.

2425
03:13:54.62 --> 03:13:56.98
Getting in trouble, and he'd get caught playing with them

2426
03:13:56.98 --> 03:13:59.66
inside, sneaking in.

2427
03:13:59.66 --> 03:14:04.82
And so the Jag, and I had court martial authority.

2428
03:14:04.82 --> 03:14:07.50
And we were doing a lot of drug stuff.

2429
03:14:07.50 --> 03:14:09.30
People really hung out in drugs.

2430
03:14:09.30 --> 03:14:11.94
And even had a couple of general court marshals.

2431
03:14:11.94 --> 03:14:15.62
Guys trying to torch a building and sabotage my car

2432
03:14:15.62 --> 03:14:18.54
and attack me with kung fu darts.

2433
03:14:18.54 --> 03:14:21.74
This is really a mess.

2434
03:14:21.74 --> 03:14:22.78
And a lot of marijuana.

2435
03:14:25.54 --> 03:14:32.22
So I says, look, I want, I says, why in the world

2436
03:14:32.22 --> 03:14:36.42
are you going to lock up a third of my troops, females,

2437
03:14:36.42 --> 03:14:37.74
and all the guys?

2438
03:14:37.74 --> 03:14:38.86
They can run around downtown and raise hell,

2439
03:14:38.86 --> 03:14:40.70
but they have to stay in the Swap Barracks.

2440
03:14:40.70 --> 03:14:43.46
I said, that's, I said, look, I'm the commander.

2441
03:14:43.46 --> 03:14:47.78
They're my people, and I want them all in my barracks.

2442
03:14:47.78 --> 03:14:50.58
And they would say, Colonel Rutan,

2443
03:14:50.58 --> 03:14:53.22
do you have any idea what would happen if we put females

2444
03:14:53.22 --> 03:14:54.38
in the barracks?

2445
03:14:54.38 --> 03:14:57.10
I says, yeah, I know exactly what would happen.

2446
03:14:57.10 --> 03:14:59.70
In about 10 days, it would sort itself out,

2447
03:14:59.70 --> 03:15:01.26
and we'd be back to normal.

2448
03:15:01.26 --> 03:15:03.06
And they could have all the rights and liberties

2449
03:15:03.06 --> 03:15:04.66
that all the guys have.

2450
03:15:04.66 --> 03:15:07.30
And I'll put one corner downstairs that would be the Waf

2451
03:15:07.30 --> 03:15:08.34
ended.

2452
03:15:08.34 --> 03:15:09.34
Ended.

2453
03:15:09.34 --> 03:15:13.82
Oh, no, man, they wouldn't have to do that at all.

2454
03:15:13.82 --> 03:15:17.50
Well, there's no smoking thing in trying to unlock my Waf

2455
03:15:17.50 --> 03:15:17.98
at night.

2456
03:15:22.34 --> 03:15:26.78
Then I was throwing kids out of the Air Force for doing drugs.

2457
03:15:26.78 --> 03:15:28.78
Boy, there's some horrible stuff that

2458
03:15:28.78 --> 03:15:29.98
was happening to these kids.

2459
03:15:29.98 --> 03:15:37.06
But then what would bother me is I'd go to the commander's

2460
03:15:37.06 --> 03:15:38.98
reception sometime.

2461
03:15:38.98 --> 03:15:42.94
When commander, he'd have the other officers into his.

2462
03:15:42.94 --> 03:15:45.06
And I'd look out in the back at these receptions,

2463
03:15:45.06 --> 03:15:47.02
and the wives would be out there token.

2464
03:15:47.02 --> 03:15:49.54
They'd be smoking marijuana.

2465
03:15:49.54 --> 03:15:52.50
And I thought, I'm throwing kids out of the Air Force

2466
03:15:52.50 --> 03:15:55.46
for what the Wafs are doing back there.

2467
03:15:55.46 --> 03:15:57.58
And I looked around at the whole scene.

2468
03:15:57.58 --> 03:15:59.74
Now, I had a great combat record.

2469
03:15:59.74 --> 03:16:04.42
I had all my military training, command and staff

2470
03:16:04.42 --> 03:16:05.50
done, all those things.

2471
03:16:05.50 --> 03:16:08.98
I was on my way to be chief of staff.

2472
03:16:08.98 --> 03:16:12.42
And I thought, it happened just like that.

2473
03:16:15.62 --> 03:16:21.34
I turned around, and I went over to this orderly room

2474
03:16:21.34 --> 03:16:25.38
or whatever the thing was, CBPO.

2475
03:16:25.38 --> 03:16:28.86
And I says, I'm going home.

2476
03:16:28.86 --> 03:16:32.78
And I had 20 years and a microsecond.

2477
03:16:32.78 --> 03:16:35.02
Just enough for the retirement.

2478
03:16:35.02 --> 03:16:37.86
And that was another area of something

2479
03:16:37.86 --> 03:16:40.22
that I just wasn't ready for, the politics of that.

2480
03:16:43.74 --> 03:16:45.58
So then it went out and got ahold of my brother,

2481
03:16:45.58 --> 03:16:46.58
and we flew around the world.

2482
03:16:49.82 --> 03:16:56.18
Yeah, and that story is a crazy story of,

2483
03:16:56.18 --> 03:17:01.46
as you're going through this thing, as you get together

2484
03:17:01.46 --> 03:17:04.22
the money, and speaking of cigarettes,

2485
03:17:04.22 --> 03:17:06.34
at one point you get a tobacco company that's

2486
03:17:06.34 --> 03:17:07.94
going to sponsor the whole thing.

2487
03:17:07.94 --> 03:17:10.30
You won't take their money.

2488
03:17:10.30 --> 03:17:12.22
So you scrap this thing together.

2489
03:17:12.22 --> 03:17:15.26
You were talking earlier about the Voyager aircraft itself.

2490
03:17:15.26 --> 03:17:16.62
And this is cool, because I remember it.

2491
03:17:16.62 --> 03:17:17.42
Dave remembers it.

2492
03:17:17.42 --> 03:17:18.90
Dave probably remembers it better than I did,

2493
03:17:18.90 --> 03:17:22.74
because he was a little aircraft addict like you were.

2494
03:17:22.74 --> 03:17:24.58
Me, I just thought it was cool.

2495
03:17:24.58 --> 03:17:27.30
But the whole thing weighed like 500 pounds

2496
03:17:27.30 --> 03:17:28.22
or something like this.

2497
03:17:28.22 --> 03:17:31.30
And you guys took this thing.

2498
03:17:31.30 --> 03:17:33.14
You fly this thing around the world.

2499
03:17:33.14 --> 03:17:38.14
You got incredible details of that inside this book.

2500
03:17:38.14 --> 03:17:40.86
Sleep deprivation, it's not what, nine days it

2501
03:17:40.86 --> 03:17:44.02
took you to do this.

2502
03:17:44.02 --> 03:17:47.14
You get done with that.

2503
03:17:47.14 --> 03:17:49.86
You run for Congress out here in Calvary.

2504
03:17:49.86 --> 03:17:51.78
You got all kinds of stuff in this book.

2505
03:17:51.78 --> 03:17:56.22
You set a bunch of records, tried to go around the world

2506
03:17:56.22 --> 03:17:57.54
again in a balloon.

2507
03:17:57.54 --> 03:17:59.58
That was interesting.

2508
03:17:59.58 --> 03:18:02.30
Well, I thought, here I am successful around the world

2509
03:18:02.30 --> 03:18:03.54
and in other places.

2510
03:18:03.54 --> 03:18:04.98
I have to do something like that.

2511
03:18:04.98 --> 03:18:08.30
You're looking for what else can I do?

2512
03:18:08.30 --> 03:18:09.50
What else is out there?

2513
03:18:09.50 --> 03:18:12.38
Has anybody gone around the world in a balloon nonstop?

2514
03:18:12.38 --> 03:18:15.02
You end up saved by a parachute again.

2515
03:18:15.02 --> 03:18:15.86
Yep, that's right.

2516
03:18:15.86 --> 03:18:18.62
It bailed out of that thing.

2517
03:18:18.62 --> 03:18:20.86
Only this time it was fully funded.

2518
03:18:20.86 --> 03:18:23.42
So I got Baron Hilton and Pepsi sponsors.

2519
03:18:23.42 --> 03:18:25.66
They got a million and a half dollars

2520
03:18:25.66 --> 03:18:30.26
and built this pressurized capsule that was pressurized.

2521
03:18:30.26 --> 03:18:34.18
I could stay in the stratosphere, even sit on the moon,

2522
03:18:34.18 --> 03:18:36.62
close loop, life support system, the radios.

2523
03:18:36.62 --> 03:18:39.42
We launched out of Albuquerque about, well,

2524
03:18:39.42 --> 03:18:41.82
we had about a three hour delay on the launch, which

2525
03:18:41.82 --> 03:18:44.50
saved our lives, really.

2526
03:18:44.50 --> 03:18:46.58
And they launched this.

2527
03:18:46.58 --> 03:18:51.78
Baron Hilton cut the thing and sirens and patriotic music.

2528
03:18:51.78 --> 03:18:56.58
And we launched off or on our way around the world.

2529
03:18:56.58 --> 03:19:01.94
Anyway, at 30,000 feet, due to a design screw up

2530
03:19:01.94 --> 03:19:05.50
by the manufacturer, the balloon wouldn't vent.

2531
03:19:05.50 --> 03:19:09.30
So as it started to heat and expand, it wouldn't vent.

2532
03:19:09.30 --> 03:19:11.14
So it actually ruptured the balloon.

2533
03:19:11.14 --> 03:19:14.82
The helium envelope blew the whole bottom of it out.

2534
03:19:14.82 --> 03:19:19.10
Of course, a lot of big explosion,

2535
03:19:19.10 --> 03:19:21.42
but it's enough to bounce us off the floor when that thing

2536
03:19:21.42 --> 03:19:22.70
let go.

2537
03:19:22.70 --> 03:19:25.54
And now we're coming down.

2538
03:19:25.54 --> 03:19:30.34
And we launched out to fly around the world

2539
03:19:30.34 --> 03:19:34.38
and didn't even get out of the county.

2540
03:19:34.38 --> 03:19:36.74
That's an opportunity for character development.

2541
03:19:40.74 --> 03:19:44.50
I ended up in a Choya cactus patch.

2542
03:19:44.50 --> 03:19:46.42
Guy says, well, what are you going to do next?

2543
03:19:46.42 --> 03:19:50.14
I says, well, this is the first day of our second attempt.

2544
03:19:50.14 --> 03:19:52.50
And anyway, since there's only one first,

2545
03:19:52.50 --> 03:19:56.98
nobody gives a crap about who does anything second.

2546
03:19:56.98 --> 03:19:59.10
A guy, a Swiss watch company.

2547
03:20:02.78 --> 03:20:04.30
God, I don't want to say the wrong.

2548
03:20:04.30 --> 03:20:06.02
I think it was Breitling.

2549
03:20:06.02 --> 03:20:09.06
The Breitling Orbiter.

2550
03:20:09.06 --> 03:20:11.02
They took off in an incredible flight

2551
03:20:11.02 --> 03:20:15.26
at Taman Jones and Pertron Bacard, deed guy.

2552
03:20:15.26 --> 03:20:17.82
And I sat there and watched him.

2553
03:20:17.82 --> 03:20:20.94
And I even made the comment in public

2554
03:20:20.94 --> 03:20:24.38
that it was all very nice to be in competition with those

2555
03:20:24.38 --> 03:20:28.26
who have absolutely no chance of success.

2556
03:20:28.26 --> 03:20:28.74
Whoops.

2557
03:20:31.46 --> 03:20:33.70
So I don't know.

2558
03:20:33.70 --> 03:20:39.14
Copilot, he was not totally honest with me about parachutes.

2559
03:20:39.14 --> 03:20:43.38
And now real strong winds on the ground, like 40-mile-hour

2560
03:20:43.38 --> 03:20:44.94
winds in a parachute.

2561
03:20:44.94 --> 03:20:47.06
And if you don't do everything exactly right,

2562
03:20:47.06 --> 03:20:49.22
you're going to get hurt really bad.

2563
03:20:49.22 --> 03:20:52.86
And unfortunately, he wasn't truthful with me

2564
03:20:52.86 --> 03:20:56.58
about his parachute experience.

2565
03:20:56.58 --> 03:21:01.90
And so he jumped out first and got a good shoot.

2566
03:21:01.90 --> 03:21:05.94
But without knowing how to handle a high-wing landing,

2567
03:21:05.94 --> 03:21:06.86
parachutes are neat.

2568
03:21:06.86 --> 03:21:08.90
They'll save you life in flight.

2569
03:21:08.90 --> 03:21:10.82
A little killy on the ground by being

2570
03:21:10.82 --> 03:21:13.50
drugged across the desert.

2571
03:21:13.50 --> 03:21:19.82
And I ended up, I landed really,

2572
03:21:19.82 --> 03:21:23.06
started to step off your car at 40 miles an hour.

2573
03:21:23.06 --> 03:21:25.62
Your feet hitting it really flips you around.

2574
03:21:25.62 --> 03:21:27.02
Anyway, he didn't know anything about that.

2575
03:21:27.02 --> 03:21:30.50
He landed backwards and he got some severe injuries.

2576
03:21:30.50 --> 03:21:34.66
And I landed properly, going backwards.

2577
03:21:34.66 --> 03:21:37.38
And my helmet hit the ground so hard

2578
03:21:37.38 --> 03:21:38.74
I thought I was going to break.

2579
03:21:38.74 --> 03:21:41.50
And by the time I got both of those things jettisoned,

2580
03:21:41.50 --> 03:21:44.86
I was in a Choya cactus patch.

2581
03:21:44.86 --> 03:21:49.18
The jumping cactus, little needle herbs, this thing.

2582
03:21:49.18 --> 03:21:52.58
And I was looking through my, looking through

2583
03:21:52.58 --> 03:21:56.34
the cactus in my face at our million-dollar balloon.

2584
03:22:00.46 --> 03:22:04.50
Of course, it would hit and knock off some of the propane

2585
03:22:04.50 --> 03:22:07.06
tanks and go back up again and hit again.

2586
03:22:07.06 --> 03:22:10.74
And it discharged different stuff and finally

2587
03:22:10.74 --> 03:22:15.78
hit a power line in Texas and it burned to the ground.

2588
03:22:15.78 --> 03:22:17.14
Well, that one burned to ground.

2589
03:22:17.14 --> 03:22:22.62
But you had already made it as the first person around the world

2590
03:22:22.62 --> 03:22:26.14
without stopping or refueling with the Voyager, which

2591
03:22:26.14 --> 03:22:30.98
is an awesome story inside this book.

2592
03:22:30.98 --> 03:22:33.58
And you've talked a little bit about it on the podcast.

2593
03:22:33.58 --> 03:22:36.10
But to get the full story, the book lays it out,

2594
03:22:36.10 --> 03:22:39.90
all kinds of issues you overcame.

2595
03:22:39.90 --> 03:22:42.42
Just an incredible story.

2596
03:22:42.42 --> 03:22:45.38
And one of the many reasons you were inducted

2597
03:22:45.38 --> 03:22:49.06
into the Aviation Hall of Fame.

2598
03:22:49.06 --> 03:22:54.98
And I mean, the stories in the book, they're just incredible.

2599
03:22:54.98 --> 03:23:00.62
If you're listening, definitely just order this book.

2600
03:23:00.62 --> 03:23:05.62
And we've been talking for a pretty long time now.

2601
03:23:05.62 --> 03:23:09.70
I don't want to take up forever.

2602
03:23:09.70 --> 03:23:11.50
But Dave, what do you got?

2603
03:23:11.50 --> 03:23:13.02
You got any questions?

2604
03:23:13.02 --> 03:23:15.42
I got all sorts of questions, but I mostly just

2605
03:23:15.42 --> 03:23:17.10
enjoyed listening.

2606
03:23:20.50 --> 03:23:22.06
We're three and a half hours into this almost.

2607
03:23:22.06 --> 03:23:25.06
And I'm just captivated here in the stories.

2608
03:23:25.06 --> 03:23:27.46
And I routinely get to say this because I

2609
03:23:27.46 --> 03:23:29.74
get to sit over here off to the side when

2610
03:23:29.74 --> 03:23:30.82
Jaco does these podcasts.

2611
03:23:30.82 --> 03:23:33.34
And I just get to watch people have these conversations.

2612
03:23:33.34 --> 03:23:36.78
But the aviation conversations are unique.

2613
03:23:36.78 --> 03:23:38.06
And they're special to me because I

2614
03:23:38.06 --> 03:23:40.34
could picture a lot of the things you're talking about.

2615
03:23:40.34 --> 03:23:42.34
I could picture the way you're describing them.

2616
03:23:42.34 --> 03:23:46.14
But unrelated to that, I've been sitting here

2617
03:23:46.14 --> 03:23:49.54
thinking this whole time about a saying that,

2618
03:23:49.54 --> 03:23:52.90
and I think it's some phrases as don't meet your heroes,

2619
03:23:52.90 --> 03:23:53.90
something like that.

2620
03:23:53.90 --> 03:23:56.46
Which I think is like some catchphrase that says,

2621
03:23:56.46 --> 03:23:58.94
well, don't meet your heroes because when you meet them,

2622
03:23:58.94 --> 03:24:00.70
you're going to be disappointed because you've created

2623
03:24:00.70 --> 03:24:03.18
this image you've had of them in your mind.

2624
03:24:03.18 --> 03:24:05.90
Well, I've gotten to meet several of my heroes

2625
03:24:05.90 --> 03:24:09.54
and never once, never once have I been disappointed.

2626
03:24:09.54 --> 03:24:12.18
But what's unique about this for me, sir,

2627
03:24:12.18 --> 03:24:15.50
is that all the other people I've ever met,

2628
03:24:15.50 --> 03:24:17.54
I can only read about them in books

2629
03:24:17.54 --> 03:24:20.50
and hear about the things that they've done.

2630
03:24:20.50 --> 03:24:24.06
But I know you because I got to see what you did.

2631
03:24:24.06 --> 03:24:27.22
I was old enough and we were modern enough

2632
03:24:27.22 --> 03:24:29.78
that what you did in that airplane in 1986.

2633
03:24:29.78 --> 03:24:32.98
And I can vividly remember the three loops you did

2634
03:24:32.98 --> 03:24:34.58
over Mojave when you landed and getting,

2635
03:24:34.58 --> 03:24:37.46
I can picture that as a teenager,

2636
03:24:37.46 --> 03:24:40.30
already captivated by airplanes.

2637
03:24:40.30 --> 03:24:43.74
So to get to sit here with you, knowing who you are,

2638
03:24:43.74 --> 03:24:46.38
not from books, but from actually seeing it happen live

2639
03:24:46.38 --> 03:24:49.90
and in person, this is just an absolute remarkable day

2640
03:24:49.90 --> 03:24:50.74
for me.

2641
03:24:50.74 --> 03:24:53.02
So I can't thank you enough for letting me be part of this.

2642
03:24:53.02 --> 03:24:54.38
This has been awesome.

2643
03:24:54.38 --> 03:24:57.18
I am honored to have met one of my heroes today.

2644
03:24:57.18 --> 03:24:58.02
This is good stuff.

2645
03:24:58.02 --> 03:24:58.86
Thank you very much.

2646
03:24:58.86 --> 03:25:02.70
This, my brother come up and he says,

2647
03:25:02.70 --> 03:25:06.14
with the advent and availability of,

2648
03:25:08.86 --> 03:25:13.70
it reminds me of an opportunity I had to meet the king,

2649
03:25:13.70 --> 03:25:15.18
the now king of England.

2650
03:25:17.74 --> 03:25:18.74
But anyway.

2651
03:25:18.74 --> 03:25:20.74
Well, what happened when you met the king of England?

2652
03:25:20.74 --> 03:25:22.10
Well, I called him, hey, Chuck,

2653
03:25:22.10 --> 03:25:23.66
and I didn't go over too well.

2654
03:25:24.78 --> 03:25:26.06
As a fellow fighter pilot.

2655
03:25:26.06 --> 03:25:29.22
I met about Americans, they'll bow down to royalty

2656
03:25:29.22 --> 03:25:30.90
in any case, I'm an American.

2657
03:25:33.30 --> 03:25:34.58
Hey, Chuck, well anyway.

2658
03:25:37.82 --> 03:25:40.94
The Bert said that with the availability of carbon fiber,

2659
03:25:40.94 --> 03:25:43.42
he thinks it's possible to build an airplane light enough

2660
03:25:43.42 --> 03:25:45.86
that it'll carry enough fuel to go around the world.

2661
03:25:46.98 --> 03:25:50.74
Now, the airplane took off, these are round numbers,

2662
03:25:50.74 --> 03:25:55.58
10,000 pounds, 3.6 tons of aviation gas,

2663
03:25:55.58 --> 03:25:56.74
3.6 tons.

2664
03:25:57.66 --> 03:26:01.58
The carbon fiber structure weighed 926 pounds

2665
03:26:02.58 --> 03:26:06.34
and a wingspan bigger than a Boeing 737

2666
03:26:06.34 --> 03:26:09.78
and a cockpit half the size of one of the restrooms

2667
03:26:10.78 --> 03:26:11.62
on the 737.

2668
03:26:13.50 --> 03:26:17.02
But all of that, that 926 pounds had to carry 3.6 tons

2669
03:26:17.02 --> 03:26:20.34
of fuel, two engines, avionics, radios, two hearty souls,

2670
03:26:20.34 --> 03:26:24.90
little food and water and launch off.

2671
03:26:24.90 --> 03:26:28.78
I, it's one of the things that you get on a train one day

2672
03:26:28.78 --> 03:26:32.70
and you realize the train's going off a cliff

2673
03:26:32.70 --> 03:26:34.58
and it's too late, you can't get off.

2674
03:26:36.82 --> 03:26:38.98
You know, five and a half years, I've told everybody,

2675
03:26:38.98 --> 03:26:41.90
hey, we're gonna fly around the world, help us out,

2676
03:26:41.90 --> 03:26:43.90
have no money, volunteers,

2677
03:26:44.94 --> 03:26:46.70
begged and borrowed quarter million dollars

2678
03:26:46.70 --> 03:26:50.14
with a carbon fiber, half a million dollars

2679
03:26:50.14 --> 03:26:52.98
with the avionics and radars back in those old days

2680
03:26:52.98 --> 03:26:54.90
with no GPS and so forth.

2681
03:26:56.74 --> 03:27:00.38
A mission control system and set that whole thing up.

2682
03:27:00.38 --> 03:27:03.50
And I describe it in the book, the first part

2683
03:27:03.50 --> 03:27:05.78
of the next five minutes.

2684
03:27:05.78 --> 03:27:09.14
And I named the book because how many times in my life

2685
03:27:09.14 --> 03:27:11.82
have I sat in a cockpit and wondered what the next five

2686
03:27:11.82 --> 03:27:13.86
minutes of my life was gonna be like?

2687
03:27:13.86 --> 03:27:16.06
And there had been a number of places.

2688
03:27:16.06 --> 03:27:18.38
And we haven't even talked about some of the flight test

2689
03:27:18.38 --> 03:27:20.30
stuff that we did with birds airplanes.

2690
03:27:20.30 --> 03:27:25.30
But the book starts with trying to put the thing

2691
03:27:26.34 --> 03:27:28.34
in perspective, what did it feel like?

2692
03:27:29.98 --> 03:27:32.10
But I first started going out and giving my talks,

2693
03:27:32.10 --> 03:27:35.58
my wife, and I met her after the flight.

2694
03:27:35.58 --> 03:27:38.10
She listened to a couple of my lectures

2695
03:27:38.10 --> 03:27:40.34
and now I'm kind of a technical person.

2696
03:27:40.34 --> 03:27:43.18
And I think it's important that my audience knows

2697
03:27:43.18 --> 03:27:45.62
how many fuel tanks we had and how we sequenced them

2698
03:27:45.62 --> 03:27:48.70
and how the L over D and all that other stuff.

2699
03:27:48.70 --> 03:27:50.78
And finally she come up to me and she says,

2700
03:27:50.78 --> 03:27:54.14
Dick, she says, nobody gives a frick about how many

2701
03:27:54.14 --> 03:27:55.42
fuel tanks.

2702
03:27:55.42 --> 03:27:58.14
And so I want you to tell them what it felt like.

2703
03:27:58.14 --> 03:28:00.34
And so I changed the whole tenor of the book.

2704
03:28:00.34 --> 03:28:02.94
And it wasn't, the book's not written for aviation

2705
03:28:02.94 --> 03:28:07.94
as you can tell, it was written for to try to talk about

2706
03:28:08.18 --> 03:28:12.98
challenges and motivation and some of the emotional

2707
03:28:12.98 --> 03:28:14.78
challenge that we had along the way.

2708
03:28:14.78 --> 03:28:19.78
And trying to set that up and the book starts with

2709
03:28:20.86 --> 03:28:22.74
I'm sitting in the end of the runway.

2710
03:28:22.74 --> 03:28:25.34
That was Air Force Base that morning.

2711
03:28:25.34 --> 03:28:30.22
We had roughly 25% more fuel than we'd ever had

2712
03:28:30.22 --> 03:28:32.50
on board before, much less flight tested.

2713
03:28:34.90 --> 03:28:38.06
The airplane was, of course there wasn't much to it

2714
03:28:38.06 --> 03:28:40.90
so it's pretty flexible and it could bend.

2715
03:28:40.90 --> 03:28:45.90
And I'm sitting there thinking because the two and a half

2716
03:28:47.46 --> 03:28:50.58
years of flight tests and the 69 flights,

2717
03:28:50.58 --> 03:28:52.74
we had some horrible emergencies.

2718
03:28:52.74 --> 03:28:54.58
Many, many, many days.

2719
03:28:54.58 --> 03:28:57.22
The propeller blade came off and it ripped the engine off.

2720
03:28:57.22 --> 03:28:59.98
It was just hanging in the bottom of the cowling

2721
03:28:59.98 --> 03:29:02.10
and flight control problems.

2722
03:29:02.10 --> 03:29:07.10
And ran into some rain and almost one of the airfoils

2723
03:29:08.54 --> 03:29:10.74
and the airplane didn't like rain and we found out

2724
03:29:10.74 --> 03:29:13.82
about it the hard way and we just barely flew out

2725
03:29:13.82 --> 03:29:14.98
of the rain in time to save.

2726
03:29:14.98 --> 03:29:17.46
I mean, there was numerous stories about that

2727
03:29:17.46 --> 03:29:18.98
that's in the book.

2728
03:29:18.98 --> 03:29:23.98
But trying to set up the situation that I'm sitting

2729
03:29:23.98 --> 03:29:26.30
at the end of the runway, what am I thinking about?

2730
03:29:26.30 --> 03:29:27.14
What's gonna happen?

2731
03:29:27.14 --> 03:29:29.06
Trying to remember some of the stuff that's happened

2732
03:29:29.06 --> 03:29:29.98
ahead at the time.

2733
03:29:31.54 --> 03:29:36.54
And another thing is people are really interesting,

2734
03:29:36.54 --> 03:29:39.52
interpersonal relationships.

2735
03:29:41.66 --> 03:29:46.66
I met, I separated from my first wife

2736
03:29:46.90 --> 03:29:49.46
and later on I met another girl.

2737
03:29:49.46 --> 03:29:51.86
Her name is Gina Yeager.

2738
03:29:51.86 --> 03:29:53.54
And we had a big and romantic thing.

2739
03:29:53.54 --> 03:29:55.42
And at the time we met, Bert says,

2740
03:29:55.42 --> 03:29:57.94
hey, how about doing this around the world thing?

2741
03:29:57.94 --> 03:29:58.78
Wow, okay.

2742
03:30:00.30 --> 03:30:03.06
Bert, you designed it and Gina and I will fly this thing

2743
03:30:03.06 --> 03:30:03.90
around the world.

2744
03:30:03.90 --> 03:30:07.74
We're off on this five year odyssey, this romantic odyssey.

2745
03:30:07.74 --> 03:30:08.90
And it was really good.

2746
03:30:09.86 --> 03:30:13.54
I mean, some of the most interesting times in my life.

2747
03:30:13.54 --> 03:30:15.98
But then for some reason she decided to,

2748
03:30:19.98 --> 03:30:23.58
well, she got out of the bed and went into the other bedroom.

2749
03:30:24.78 --> 03:30:27.50
And I didn't have enough time to replace her.

2750
03:30:27.50 --> 03:30:29.38
And there was a whole bunch of pressure going on.

2751
03:30:29.38 --> 03:30:34.38
So all of a sudden we're, we're have this romance ended

2752
03:30:35.66 --> 03:30:37.78
and we weren't even talking to each other.

2753
03:30:37.78 --> 03:30:41.62
And now we got to go and fly around the world together.

2754
03:30:41.62 --> 03:30:45.66
And the fact is that it takes two pilots to do that.

2755
03:30:46.62 --> 03:30:49.58
You know, you take turns, but she couldn't fly the airplane.

2756
03:30:50.78 --> 03:30:52.78
She didn't want to learn how to operate

2757
03:30:52.78 --> 03:30:53.70
in any of the systems.

2758
03:30:53.70 --> 03:30:55.02
I kept saying, damn it.

2759
03:30:56.02 --> 03:30:58.34
I can't do this thing by myself.

2760
03:30:58.34 --> 03:30:59.78
I need to have another pilot.

2761
03:30:59.78 --> 03:31:02.82
You need to burn this, but you wouldn't.

2762
03:31:02.82 --> 03:31:05.26
And I says, if you don't learn how to run and set up

2763
03:31:05.26 --> 03:31:08.02
the nav systems and all the other complicated things

2764
03:31:08.02 --> 03:31:09.94
about this airplane, I'm going to replace you

2765
03:31:09.94 --> 03:31:11.18
with an actual pilot.

2766
03:31:12.22 --> 03:31:14.22
And she looked at me and says,

2767
03:31:14.22 --> 03:31:16.42
you either take me or I'll burn the airplane.

2768
03:31:18.14 --> 03:31:22.22
So my choices were two and one of them would have been in jail.

2769
03:31:23.50 --> 03:31:26.22
And so when we, the two of us climbed into that airplane

2770
03:31:26.22 --> 03:31:29.66
that day, that morning at Edwards Air Force Base,

2771
03:31:31.18 --> 03:31:33.74
I had no idea how we were going to do this.

2772
03:31:33.74 --> 03:31:36.10
Ha ha ha ha.

2773
03:31:36.10 --> 03:31:38.66
What did you think your percentage chance of success was?

2774
03:31:38.66 --> 03:31:39.50
Well, none.

2775
03:31:39.50 --> 03:31:40.70
It was all set up.

2776
03:31:40.70 --> 03:31:42.02
It was to go.

2777
03:31:42.86 --> 03:31:46.54
It didn't have enough time to fix any of these things.

2778
03:31:46.54 --> 03:31:49.38
The weatherman came up one day and he says,

2779
03:31:49.38 --> 03:31:51.30
you know, we've been working really hard on this thing

2780
03:31:51.30 --> 03:31:53.34
to get all the systems, the mission control,

2781
03:31:53.34 --> 03:31:55.86
the weather, the communication systems, the worldwide,

2782
03:31:55.86 --> 03:31:58.06
all this stuff had to be set up.

2783
03:31:58.06 --> 03:32:01.54
And it says that, and the weather was terrible.

2784
03:32:01.54 --> 03:32:04.02
And we had missed the weather window.

2785
03:32:05.98 --> 03:32:10.18
And it was in December and it was outside of the weather window.

2786
03:32:10.18 --> 03:32:13.22
And the weather guy, Len Selman, comes up and he says,

2787
03:32:13.22 --> 03:32:15.90
hey, Dick, he says, well, we missed the weather window.

2788
03:32:15.90 --> 03:32:17.66
We have to wait till next year.

2789
03:32:17.66 --> 03:32:21.94
And I said, all of this stuff that we're borrowed,

2790
03:32:21.94 --> 03:32:25.82
all these big, huge computers and communications,

2791
03:32:25.82 --> 03:32:27.50
these systems are all borrowed.

2792
03:32:27.50 --> 03:32:30.94
And I didn't know if I could get all that equipment

2793
03:32:30.94 --> 03:32:33.90
back in a year and all the people back in a year.

2794
03:32:33.90 --> 03:32:35.10
And I looked at him and I says,

2795
03:32:35.10 --> 03:32:37.90
Len, I says, the airplane's not ready yet.

2796
03:32:37.90 --> 03:32:38.74
It's close.

2797
03:32:39.78 --> 03:32:43.94
He says, when the airplane is finally ready,

2798
03:32:43.94 --> 03:32:45.18
I'm gonna walk outside.

2799
03:32:45.18 --> 03:32:46.02
It's a metaphor.

2800
03:32:46.02 --> 03:32:47.42
So I'm gonna walk outside.

2801
03:32:48.38 --> 03:32:50.34
And if it's raining, I'll wait.

2802
03:32:50.34 --> 03:32:52.42
And if it's not raining, then I'm gonna go.

2803
03:32:52.42 --> 03:32:54.34
I says, you go back in your weather thing

2804
03:32:54.34 --> 03:32:56.14
and you find me a way around the world

2805
03:32:56.14 --> 03:32:58.18
outside of the weather window.

2806
03:32:58.18 --> 03:33:00.30
And next day he comes back and says,

2807
03:33:00.30 --> 03:33:02.82
hey, Dick, I think I found you away, except for one thing.

2808
03:33:02.82 --> 03:33:04.46
Can't get you across Africa.

2809
03:33:06.74 --> 03:33:09.70
And the map, look at the world map, big, wet maps.

2810
03:33:09.70 --> 03:33:11.14
Africa's only this bit.

2811
03:33:12.86 --> 03:33:14.78
I'm worried about that when we get there.

2812
03:33:14.78 --> 03:33:17.18
Profound, as you see in the movie.

2813
03:33:17.18 --> 03:33:22.18
So anyway, I wanted to rest when the airplane

2814
03:33:25.50 --> 03:33:28.02
is finally ready and all the people sign off,

2815
03:33:28.02 --> 03:33:30.70
not metaphorically, they say that it's ready.

2816
03:33:30.70 --> 03:33:33.42
The engines, the systems, everything is ready to go.

2817
03:33:35.10 --> 03:33:38.82
Refueling, and bousers are ready at Edwards Air Force Base.

2818
03:33:38.82 --> 03:33:40.38
The press has been notified.

2819
03:33:42.62 --> 03:33:45.18
I thought, when that's done,

2820
03:33:45.18 --> 03:33:49.46
Jane and I, we can go up in the sears and just rest.

2821
03:33:49.46 --> 03:33:53.02
Needed to have some rest, just to be ready.

2822
03:33:55.10 --> 03:33:57.30
And when it was finally ready the next morning,

2823
03:33:57.30 --> 03:33:59.50
we had a weather briefing that was either go or no,

2824
03:33:59.50 --> 03:34:00.58
go at 10 o'clock.

2825
03:34:01.54 --> 03:34:03.94
And I walked into the weather briefing

2826
03:34:03.94 --> 03:34:06.54
and Lynn Stelman, the weather guy comes in

2827
03:34:06.54 --> 03:34:09.18
and he's smiling, I thought, oh shoot.

2828
03:34:10.30 --> 03:34:12.58
And he's telling me, but during the briefing,

2829
03:34:12.58 --> 03:34:16.22
I realized that the weather is perfect for departure,

2830
03:34:17.10 --> 03:34:18.22
except for Africa.

2831
03:34:20.34 --> 03:34:24.42
And I thought, God, I'm just one day off.

2832
03:34:24.42 --> 03:34:26.06
I could just go and get my head clear.

2833
03:34:26.06 --> 03:34:28.70
One day is all I wanted, but there wasn't.

2834
03:34:29.50 --> 03:34:33.06
And it's just like General Eisenhower,

2835
03:34:33.06 --> 03:34:35.34
when it was gone D-day, they all looked at him

2836
03:34:35.34 --> 03:34:37.30
and said he had to say go or no, go.

2837
03:34:38.54 --> 03:34:41.74
And I says, okay, let's go.

2838
03:34:41.74 --> 03:34:44.78
And in 10 seconds, I was alone in the room,

2839
03:34:44.78 --> 03:34:46.34
everybody had left.

2840
03:34:46.34 --> 03:34:47.62
You know, it's all choreographed,

2841
03:34:47.62 --> 03:34:49.34
when the engine starts, take it over there,

2842
03:34:49.34 --> 03:34:52.46
set it up at Edwards Air Force Base, the fuel bousers.

2843
03:34:52.46 --> 03:34:56.04
And we had the last supper with the family.

2844
03:35:00.10 --> 03:35:03.58
Then I thought that here I am, I should have the VIP quarters.

2845
03:35:04.98 --> 03:35:07.90
The VIP quarters up at Edwards, then I didn't check on it,

2846
03:35:07.90 --> 03:35:09.86
I trusted somebody else to do that.

2847
03:35:09.86 --> 03:35:12.18
Well, they didn't, they didn't know anything about it.

2848
03:35:12.18 --> 03:35:15.42
And so I ended up in a real old barracks,

2849
03:35:15.42 --> 03:35:19.58
kind of one step up from an open bay barracks.

2850
03:35:19.58 --> 03:35:23.62
And those things, they have central heating

2851
03:35:23.62 --> 03:35:26.70
and the ducts whistle and they make a lot of noise.

2852
03:35:26.70 --> 03:35:30.02
And this, go in this room and it's bare.

2853
03:35:30.02 --> 03:35:33.90
And it's an old military bed with the steel thing on it.

2854
03:35:34.90 --> 03:35:37.02
And it's just a terrible thing.

2855
03:35:37.02 --> 03:35:41.58
I thought, God, I asked the driver, I says,

2856
03:35:41.58 --> 03:35:44.46
well, hey, there's the VIP quarters over there.

2857
03:35:44.46 --> 03:35:46.14
You know, here I'm gonna fly around the world,

2858
03:35:46.14 --> 03:35:47.70
at least somebody, he says,

2859
03:35:47.70 --> 03:35:50.38
that he didn't even know anything about that.

2860
03:35:50.38 --> 03:35:52.02
God, that's, okay.

2861
03:35:53.54 --> 03:35:55.62
So I'm laying in there and listening to that.

2862
03:35:55.62 --> 03:36:00.62
And of course, you know, it's a wake up in a handful of hours.

2863
03:36:01.18 --> 03:36:03.74
And I'm laying there and it's hot

2864
03:36:03.74 --> 03:36:06.66
and I'm trying to get some sleep.

2865
03:36:06.66 --> 03:36:08.90
And all of a sudden there's a knock on the door.

2866
03:36:10.54 --> 03:36:14.42
I thought, knock on the door, who in the hell is this?

2867
03:36:14.42 --> 03:36:15.26
So I'm really pissed.

2868
03:36:15.26 --> 03:36:17.50
I get up, open the door and I fly surgeon,

2869
03:36:17.50 --> 03:36:19.86
Dr. George Jutland is there.

2870
03:36:19.86 --> 03:36:24.54
He's our flight guy for all of our medical stuff.

2871
03:36:25.58 --> 03:36:28.58
And I said, George, what are you doing?

2872
03:36:28.58 --> 03:36:30.50
And he says, oh, Dick, I forgot.

2873
03:36:31.54 --> 03:36:33.38
And he had a little box.

2874
03:36:33.38 --> 03:36:36.34
You know, like the children's milk cartons,

2875
03:36:36.34 --> 03:36:39.06
they're, you know, they're open them up and stuff.

2876
03:36:39.06 --> 03:36:41.66
He says, I want a urine sample when you wake up.

2877
03:36:42.94 --> 03:36:45.50
And here's the box that I want you to do it.

2878
03:36:46.70 --> 03:36:50.02
And I thought, George, you woke me up.

2879
03:36:50.02 --> 03:36:52.66
You woke me up to give me a box to piss in.

2880
03:36:55.46 --> 03:36:56.66
And then I was really pissed.

2881
03:36:56.66 --> 03:36:59.58
I was so keyed up about that.

2882
03:36:59.58 --> 03:37:00.82
I don't think I slept in the,

2883
03:37:00.82 --> 03:37:02.58
finally the wake up time column.

2884
03:37:02.58 --> 03:37:05.70
And we went out and called in the board of airplane

2885
03:37:05.70 --> 03:37:10.30
with no sleep per se and a copilot

2886
03:37:10.30 --> 03:37:11.94
that wouldn't talk into me.

2887
03:37:11.94 --> 03:37:14.62
It didn't know how to do run any of the systems.

2888
03:37:14.62 --> 03:37:16.18
And we took off having no idea

2889
03:37:16.18 --> 03:37:18.18
how in the hell I was going to do this.

2890
03:37:19.54 --> 03:37:23.46
And we thought about all the stuff we'd gone through

2891
03:37:23.46 --> 03:37:25.46
in the last five and a half years.

2892
03:37:27.14 --> 03:37:29.46
And then it was time.

2893
03:37:29.46 --> 03:37:31.14
And I thought, you know, Dick,

2894
03:37:31.14 --> 03:37:33.38
you're probably going to be dead in the next five minutes.

2895
03:37:33.38 --> 03:37:35.82
What you really ought to do right now

2896
03:37:35.82 --> 03:37:40.18
is shut the engine down and open the little canopy

2897
03:37:40.18 --> 03:37:41.90
and get out and walk out in the desert.

2898
03:37:41.90 --> 03:37:43.30
At least you'll be alive tomorrow.

2899
03:37:43.30 --> 03:37:45.74
And then I thought, wait a minute,

2900
03:37:45.74 --> 03:37:48.34
I ask all these people all these years

2901
03:37:48.34 --> 03:37:49.98
to come and help me.

2902
03:37:49.98 --> 03:37:52.46
And a lot of them sacrifice quite a bit.

2903
03:37:52.46 --> 03:37:55.18
Some of them even lost their jobs and come and help.

2904
03:37:55.18 --> 03:37:58.34
Had I done that, they would have had every right

2905
03:37:58.34 --> 03:38:02.14
to chase me down and commit premature euthanasia

2906
03:38:02.14 --> 03:38:05.18
for some damn coward that totally deserved it.

2907
03:38:05.18 --> 03:38:06.70
So I said, there's no way out.

2908
03:38:06.70 --> 03:38:07.62
There's no way.

2909
03:38:08.58 --> 03:38:11.46
So that morning, trepidation,

2910
03:38:11.46 --> 03:38:13.82
I pushed both of the throttles wide open,

2911
03:38:13.82 --> 03:38:17.58
released a little tiny break like a foot on a nose wheel

2912
03:38:17.58 --> 03:38:20.10
or something, foot on a skateboard.

2913
03:38:20.10 --> 03:38:21.62
Because breaks are really heavy,

2914
03:38:21.62 --> 03:38:23.26
so we didn't take any breaks.

2915
03:38:24.42 --> 03:38:26.42
And that thing lumbered down the runway.

2916
03:38:26.42 --> 03:38:31.42
And it accelerated, yeah, there was an acceleration checkpoint.

2917
03:38:35.70 --> 03:38:38.30
And I put more fuel on board the airplane

2918
03:38:38.30 --> 03:38:40.38
than what the designer wanted.

2919
03:38:40.38 --> 03:38:42.22
And Eve was really mad about that.

2920
03:38:43.14 --> 03:38:44.86
But I was worried about running out of fuel.

2921
03:38:44.86 --> 03:38:47.06
I always had this nightmare that run out of fuel

2922
03:38:47.06 --> 03:38:50.18
100 miles short, hell of a record,

2923
03:38:50.18 --> 03:38:52.66
but we still failed on first around the world.

2924
03:38:52.66 --> 03:38:58.14
So he put up some flag markers down the runway.

2925
03:38:58.14 --> 03:39:02.38
And he says, Dick, you need to have this specific airspeed

2926
03:39:02.38 --> 03:39:04.38
as you cross each one of the markers.

2927
03:39:04.38 --> 03:39:06.78
And because you don't really have wheel brakes

2928
03:39:06.78 --> 03:39:10.26
on the airplane, to be able to stop

2929
03:39:10.26 --> 03:39:13.26
before you run out in Edwards Dry Lake,

2930
03:39:13.26 --> 03:39:17.66
you need to have these target airspeed as you cross them.

2931
03:39:18.70 --> 03:39:22.02
Well, he didn't know it, but Dick was really tired.

2932
03:39:22.02 --> 03:39:24.34
He had been at this thing five and a half years

2933
03:39:24.34 --> 03:39:27.82
and all these emotional things with my girlfriend

2934
03:39:27.82 --> 03:39:30.38
plus all the other things that we had to deal with.

2935
03:39:30.38 --> 03:39:31.22
The only thing I wanted,

2936
03:39:31.22 --> 03:39:33.70
I just wanted this frickin' thing over with.

2937
03:39:33.70 --> 03:39:35.86
And I didn't care if I was on fire.

2938
03:39:36.78 --> 03:39:38.34
I wasn't gonna quit.

2939
03:39:38.34 --> 03:39:40.14
So I had to give him a blood oath to my brother,

2940
03:39:40.14 --> 03:39:43.50
okay, I'll do that, promise, promise, no one full will.

2941
03:39:43.50 --> 03:39:45.54
There's no frickin' way I'm gonna quit.

2942
03:39:45.54 --> 03:39:46.74
I want it over with.

2943
03:39:46.74 --> 03:39:48.78
I just, you get to that point.

2944
03:39:48.78 --> 03:39:52.98
And so we started accelerating.

2945
03:39:52.98 --> 03:39:55.50
As the flag markers came by,

2946
03:39:55.50 --> 03:39:58.94
we were starting to get one knot low, two knots, three knots.

2947
03:39:58.94 --> 03:40:02.58
And at midfield, the last marker,

2948
03:40:02.58 --> 03:40:07.58
we needed 86 knots.

2949
03:40:07.90 --> 03:40:10.58
Yeah, 100 knots for takeoff, 86 knots.

2950
03:40:14.10 --> 03:40:16.42
And I was four knots low.

2951
03:40:16.42 --> 03:40:17.62
So I keyed the mic button.

2952
03:40:17.62 --> 03:40:19.78
It says we're four knots low at midfield.

2953
03:40:21.10 --> 03:40:22.62
And nobody said anything.

2954
03:40:22.62 --> 03:40:24.74
I think everybody knew there was no frickin' way

2955
03:40:24.74 --> 03:40:25.90
I was gonna quit.

2956
03:40:25.90 --> 03:40:28.62
Besides that, the airspeed indicator's over here, see?

2957
03:40:28.62 --> 03:40:30.54
And here's 65.

2958
03:40:30.54 --> 03:40:33.22
It only had to go a little bit farther to 100.

2959
03:40:33.22 --> 03:40:34.06
A little bit more.

2960
03:40:34.06 --> 03:40:35.98
Just a little bit more.

2961
03:40:35.98 --> 03:40:36.82
This is all I have to,

2962
03:40:36.82 --> 03:40:38.26
and I looked down at the end of the runway,

2963
03:40:38.26 --> 03:40:41.14
it's still a mile and a half away.

2964
03:40:41.14 --> 03:40:43.30
I said, shoot, there's no problem.

2965
03:40:43.30 --> 03:40:45.98
Not knowing that the faster you go,

2966
03:40:45.98 --> 03:40:48.14
the more rapid you consume the runway.

2967
03:40:49.98 --> 03:40:54.26
And so we hit our rotation speed,

2968
03:40:54.26 --> 03:40:56.42
and I gave it three more knots from mom.

2969
03:40:57.26 --> 03:40:59.66
And the wingtips were dragging on the runway.

2970
03:41:01.26 --> 03:41:03.82
And I reached up and grabbed that control stick,

2971
03:41:03.82 --> 03:41:04.66
and it says, well, Dick,

2972
03:41:04.66 --> 03:41:06.94
if you've never been smooth in any time of your life,

2973
03:41:06.94 --> 03:41:09.82
you better be smooth now, because this is the big one.

2974
03:41:10.78 --> 03:41:13.22
And I reached down there and started pulling back on the stick,

2975
03:41:13.22 --> 03:41:15.06
and the canard lifted, and the boom tank

2976
03:41:15.06 --> 03:41:17.66
started coming up, and I could see the wings come up

2977
03:41:17.66 --> 03:41:19.54
slowly, slowly, slowly.

2978
03:41:19.54 --> 03:41:22.70
And I swear to God, they were gonna touch over my head.

2979
03:41:22.70 --> 03:41:26.46
And with 95% of that world's longest runway, it lifted off.

2980
03:41:27.90 --> 03:41:32.10
And actually, I have the video,

2981
03:41:32.10 --> 03:41:35.26
if you wanna look at it, or see it, or include it,

2982
03:41:35.26 --> 03:41:39.46
but the wings came up real slow, and it lifted off,

2983
03:41:39.46 --> 03:41:40.82
and it flew in ground effect,

2984
03:41:40.82 --> 03:41:42.74
and it finally got to 100 knots.

2985
03:41:42.74 --> 03:41:44.10
And if it got to 100 knots,

2986
03:41:44.10 --> 03:41:45.62
we had enough power to climb.

2987
03:41:46.54 --> 03:41:50.06
And so we shook off the wingtips, which were damaged,

2988
03:41:50.06 --> 03:41:51.66
lost three foot of wingspan.

2989
03:41:52.70 --> 03:41:54.42
And they were talking about aborting,

2990
03:41:54.42 --> 03:41:57.90
and I says, there ain't no fine way I'm gonna quit.

2991
03:41:57.90 --> 03:42:00.74
They're just not gonna quit under any circumstances.

2992
03:42:00.74 --> 03:42:02.10
I don't care what's wrong with the airplane,

2993
03:42:02.10 --> 03:42:03.14
it could be on fire.

2994
03:42:04.10 --> 03:42:07.60
And so we turned and put W in the compass.

2995
03:42:08.94 --> 03:42:12.74
And metaphorically, I held W in the compass

2996
03:42:12.74 --> 03:42:17.62
for nine bloody days, and looked up without turning around.

2997
03:42:18.86 --> 03:42:21.82
And there was Edwards Air Force Base ahead of us.

2998
03:42:21.82 --> 03:42:22.94
I guess the world is round.

2999
03:42:22.94 --> 03:42:25.62
It's still amazing to me that normally,

3000
03:42:25.62 --> 03:42:27.46
if you fly a long ways to get home,

3001
03:42:27.46 --> 03:42:29.58
you gotta turn on a comeback.

3002
03:42:29.58 --> 03:42:31.54
But if you just keep going in the same direction

3003
03:42:31.54 --> 03:42:35.66
and you get home, it's still strange.

3004
03:42:35.66 --> 03:42:39.18
I guess maybe the world is round, but I know one thing.

3005
03:42:39.18 --> 03:42:41.78
It's a bloody long ways around the world.

3006
03:42:41.78 --> 03:42:44.38
The world is 25,000 miles at the equator,

3007
03:42:45.98 --> 03:42:47.06
or just under that.

3008
03:42:48.78 --> 03:42:53.78
The Voyager actually flew 26,358 statute miles unrefueled.

3009
03:42:55.70 --> 03:42:59.30
We got home with one half of 1% of our takeoff fuel.

3010
03:43:00.38 --> 03:43:01.94
So we just barely made it back.

3011
03:43:03.02 --> 03:43:06.50
But that morning, it was beautiful in the LA Basin

3012
03:43:06.50 --> 03:43:07.54
at the high desert.

3013
03:43:08.38 --> 03:43:10.38
Tens of thousands of people came out.

3014
03:43:10.38 --> 03:43:15.38
And cars were lined up all the way back in the Lancaster.

3015
03:43:17.58 --> 03:43:19.10
And a lot of people.

3016
03:43:20.74 --> 03:43:24.58
And somebody says, hey, Dick, if you orbit for 20 minutes

3017
03:43:24.58 --> 03:43:26.30
more, you'll have an even nine days.

3018
03:43:26.30 --> 03:43:29.34
And I always thought, well, that would sound better.

3019
03:43:29.34 --> 03:43:32.70
And so we orbited around and flew over the crown

3020
03:43:32.70 --> 03:43:36.54
and said things like, hey, Dick, what time is it?

3021
03:43:36.54 --> 03:43:39.06
They says, well, it's Miller time.

3022
03:43:39.06 --> 03:43:40.34
You only go around once.

3023
03:43:40.34 --> 03:43:42.42
That was the beer at the time.

3024
03:43:42.42 --> 03:43:46.66
Another one says, Dick, what are you gonna do now?

3025
03:43:46.66 --> 03:43:48.34
I says, going to Disneyland.

3026
03:43:49.98 --> 03:43:53.54
And Eisner was the head of Disney at that time.

3027
03:43:53.54 --> 03:43:56.22
And his wife said that that was the first time

3028
03:43:56.22 --> 03:43:59.70
that that thing had ever been said in public.

3029
03:43:59.70 --> 03:44:02.18
And then I said after that, no one that,

3030
03:44:03.26 --> 03:44:05.86
that I invented that or whatever,

3031
03:44:05.86 --> 03:44:09.38
that I guess Joe Namath or some football player

3032
03:44:09.38 --> 03:44:10.98
that won the Super Bowl.

3033
03:44:10.98 --> 03:44:13.18
And he says, what are you gonna do now, Joe?

3034
03:44:13.18 --> 03:44:14.10
Or whatever his name was.

3035
03:44:14.10 --> 03:44:15.30
Well, I'm going to Disneyland.

3036
03:44:15.30 --> 03:44:18.18
Well, they probably paid him $50,000 to do that.

3037
03:44:18.18 --> 03:44:19.42
Didn't pay me anything.

3038
03:44:21.66 --> 03:44:26.18
But that day it went out and we put the landing gear down

3039
03:44:27.14 --> 03:44:29.70
and it was gonna land in the dry lake.

3040
03:44:29.70 --> 03:44:31.70
I mean, we were so light then

3041
03:44:31.70 --> 03:44:33.94
it could have landed on my briefcase.

3042
03:44:33.94 --> 03:44:36.42
But it was gonna land at Edward's Air Force Base

3043
03:44:36.42 --> 03:44:39.18
in the famous Murat dry lake.

3044
03:44:39.18 --> 03:44:40.98
And so we came around.

3045
03:44:40.98 --> 03:44:42.26
And another thing I was worried about

3046
03:44:42.26 --> 03:44:44.82
is on the dry lake, there's no depth perception.

3047
03:44:44.82 --> 03:44:47.66
And I had basically been awake for nine days.

3048
03:44:47.66 --> 03:44:52.66
I sat in the seat for three nights, four days, three nights.

3049
03:44:52.82 --> 03:44:55.18
Going into the fourth night, I says, even Dick,

3050
03:44:55.18 --> 03:44:57.38
you can't do this, you gotta get some sleep.

3051
03:44:57.38 --> 03:44:59.42
But I couldn't put her in the seat.

3052
03:44:59.42 --> 03:45:02.26
Because when we were heavy, if the autopilot kicked off,

3053
03:45:02.26 --> 03:45:04.70
the airplane itself was struck in 15 seconds.

3054
03:45:04.70 --> 03:45:06.42
And I couldn't get to the controls.

3055
03:45:07.34 --> 03:45:09.50
So we had to wait till we burned off in the fuel

3056
03:45:09.50 --> 03:45:13.22
that it would dampen it, dampen itself out.

3057
03:45:13.22 --> 03:45:15.54
So we came around and touched down

3058
03:45:17.30 --> 03:45:19.54
a good buddy, Mike Melville, he counted it down

3059
03:45:19.54 --> 03:45:22.82
to five to four, three, one touchdown

3060
03:45:24.26 --> 03:45:26.62
on aviation's hallowed ground.

3061
03:45:26.62 --> 03:45:28.86
You know, we're Chuck Yeager and Scott Crossfield,

3062
03:45:28.86 --> 03:45:30.86
chasted demons in the sky.

3063
03:45:30.86 --> 03:45:33.82
What an honor to be able to land in that place

3064
03:45:33.82 --> 03:45:36.18
and taxied up to the crowd

3065
03:45:37.74 --> 03:45:40.46
and shut off those engines that had run for solid

3066
03:45:40.46 --> 03:45:41.54
for nine days.

3067
03:45:42.50 --> 03:45:44.90
And I looked around at everybody

3068
03:45:44.90 --> 03:45:48.82
and I set my head back a little bit and I closed my eyes.

3069
03:45:49.78 --> 03:45:53.42
And it felt every bit as good as I had imagined it

3070
03:45:53.42 --> 03:46:00.42
for the last five and a half years.

3071
03:46:05.54 --> 03:46:08.30
And the airplane hangs in the National Air and Space Museum

3072
03:46:09.46 --> 03:46:10.30
in the mall.

3073
03:46:11.90 --> 03:46:13.98
Well, I think they're doing some renovation

3074
03:46:13.98 --> 03:46:15.50
that had hung there.

3075
03:46:15.50 --> 03:46:18.14
You know, it's a tribute to a couple of things,

3076
03:46:18.14 --> 03:46:20.82
to the freedom that we have in our country.

3077
03:46:20.82 --> 03:46:23.22
And also that if you can, like mom says,

3078
03:46:23.22 --> 03:46:24.62
if you can dream it, you can do it.

3079
03:46:24.62 --> 03:46:27.02
And the only way to fail is if you quit.

3080
03:46:27.02 --> 03:46:29.34
It managed the motivation.

3081
03:46:29.34 --> 03:46:34.46
And in the book there, when President Reagan and Nancy

3082
03:46:34.46 --> 03:46:36.78
presented to us the citizens medal,

3083
03:46:40.82 --> 03:46:43.30
just a couple of days after the flight,

3084
03:46:43.30 --> 03:46:45.78
they're in Crystal City in Los Angeles.

3085
03:46:47.90 --> 03:46:49.70
There was some species given.

3086
03:46:49.70 --> 03:46:51.38
You know, Bert and I said something

3087
03:46:51.38 --> 03:46:55.62
and Gina said something and the president said something.

3088
03:46:55.62 --> 03:46:58.86
But we got to meet them and get acquainted with them

3089
03:46:58.86 --> 03:47:00.26
about who they were.

3090
03:47:00.26 --> 03:47:02.82
And when we first met in the anti-room

3091
03:47:02.82 --> 03:47:05.70
before we went on stage to accept the medals,

3092
03:47:05.70 --> 03:47:08.58
we started talking and we were nervous

3093
03:47:08.58 --> 03:47:10.58
we're going to meet the president.

3094
03:47:10.58 --> 03:47:14.02
And as we sit there and started to talk a little bit,

3095
03:47:14.02 --> 03:47:18.34
where we were, we reversed positions subconsciously.

3096
03:47:18.34 --> 03:47:21.18
And I realized there as nervous as we were.

3097
03:47:21.18 --> 03:47:23.14
This is the presidency.

3098
03:47:23.14 --> 03:47:25.90
And we got invited to Washington and had dinner

3099
03:47:25.90 --> 03:47:28.06
a couple of times in a state dinner,

3100
03:47:28.06 --> 03:47:30.78
sitting at the same table with Ronald Reagan,

3101
03:47:30.78 --> 03:47:32.98
what an honor that was.

3102
03:47:32.98 --> 03:47:35.82
And he is every bit.

3103
03:47:35.82 --> 03:47:38.66
And in the book, I found the transcripts

3104
03:47:38.66 --> 03:47:39.78
of the words that we're saying.

3105
03:47:39.78 --> 03:47:44.78
And I read them today, I says, I said that extemporaneously.

3106
03:47:47.22 --> 03:47:49.18
But it turned out really well.

3107
03:47:49.18 --> 03:47:52.98
And especially it's all done because like we talked

3108
03:47:52.98 --> 03:47:57.78
during that presentation with the president about freedom,

3109
03:47:57.78 --> 03:47:58.86
how precious that is.

3110
03:48:01.82 --> 03:48:04.78
Well, no doubt about that.

3111
03:48:04.78 --> 03:48:07.98
And the book definitely spells that out.

3112
03:48:07.98 --> 03:48:12.30
And just the whole story is incredible.

3113
03:48:12.30 --> 03:48:14.78
Your story is incredible.

3114
03:48:14.78 --> 03:48:17.06
I want to close out with something

3115
03:48:17.06 --> 03:48:19.38
that you write in the book.

3116
03:48:19.38 --> 03:48:21.82
Something you write in the book about your best friend, Howard

3117
03:48:21.82 --> 03:48:23.42
K. Williams.

3118
03:48:23.42 --> 03:48:26.02
As we talked about earlier, you call Howie.

3119
03:48:26.02 --> 03:48:27.90
Again, he was shot down in Vietnam.

3120
03:48:27.90 --> 03:48:30.74
It was there was a lot of unknowns about what

3121
03:48:30.74 --> 03:48:32.54
had actually happened to him.

3122
03:48:32.54 --> 03:48:35.14
You had that mystery phone call.

3123
03:48:35.14 --> 03:48:39.78
And it wasn't until 1992 when his remains

3124
03:48:39.78 --> 03:48:44.94
were recovered by the POWMIA Resolution Task Force.

3125
03:48:44.94 --> 03:48:50.38
And as you mentioned earlier, you attended the service.

3126
03:48:50.38 --> 03:48:55.14
And you wrote about that in the book.

3127
03:48:55.14 --> 03:48:59.74
You say, Howie's military funeral at Arlington National

3128
03:48:59.74 --> 03:49:01.46
Cemetery was an impressive ceremony

3129
03:49:01.46 --> 03:49:06.38
with full military honors befitting a fallen hero.

3130
03:49:06.38 --> 03:49:10.10
The POWMIA name brace that's worn by his friends and family

3131
03:49:10.10 --> 03:49:13.66
were ceremoniously added to the grave.

3132
03:49:13.66 --> 03:49:18.70
As I turned to leave the grave site, I saw Howard's son.

3133
03:49:18.70 --> 03:49:21.82
He was only four or five when I had last seen him at Luke.

3134
03:49:21.82 --> 03:49:24.86
But at this moment, I couldn't believe my eyes.

3135
03:49:24.86 --> 03:49:27.46
He was the spitting image of his father.

3136
03:49:27.46 --> 03:49:31.98
My buddy would have been so proud of his boy.

3137
03:49:31.98 --> 03:49:34.54
Future visits to Washington DC would always

3138
03:49:34.54 --> 03:49:38.98
find me at the Vietnam War Memorial.

3139
03:49:38.98 --> 03:49:42.30
That symbolic black granite wall contains

3140
03:49:42.30 --> 03:49:46.54
more than 58,000 names of fellow warriors killed

3141
03:49:46.54 --> 03:49:49.42
and missing in action.

3142
03:49:49.42 --> 03:49:53.30
I run my fingers over the name of one of America's best

3143
03:49:53.30 --> 03:49:58.50
and one of my very best friends, Howard K. Williams.

3144
03:49:58.50 --> 03:50:01.10
Each time I stand before his engraved name,

3145
03:50:01.10 --> 03:50:04.06
I swear I see his reflection smiling back at me

3146
03:50:04.06 --> 03:50:08.06
from within the dark granite surface.

3147
03:50:08.06 --> 03:50:10.18
I continue to miss him.

3148
03:50:10.18 --> 03:50:15.14
And for all these years, I have wondered what really happened.

3149
03:50:15.14 --> 03:50:18.26
I recall the comradery and fellowship

3150
03:50:18.26 --> 03:50:20.66
of the fledgling fighter pilots off

3151
03:50:20.66 --> 03:50:23.62
to test their skills in mankind's epitome

3152
03:50:23.62 --> 03:50:27.90
of human competition, deadly combat.

3153
03:50:27.90 --> 03:50:31.30
And I thank them, especially Howie,

3154
03:50:31.30 --> 03:50:41.70
for their sacrifice that allows me to live a full life.

3155
03:50:41.70 --> 03:50:48.70
So, sir, thank you.

3156
03:50:48.70 --> 03:50:52.22
Thanks to you and all your comrades

3157
03:50:52.22 --> 03:50:55.66
that served and sacrificed for our freedom.

3158
03:50:55.66 --> 03:50:56.74
Well, thank you.

3159
03:50:56.74 --> 03:51:00.26
Look at it as a fellow warrior.

3160
03:51:00.26 --> 03:51:01.82
There's just one thing.

3161
03:51:01.82 --> 03:51:05.46
There's an individual whose name is Jeremiah Denton.

3162
03:51:05.46 --> 03:51:07.90
And he spent many years as a prisoner

3163
03:51:07.90 --> 03:51:13.58
of war at the North Vietnamese.

3164
03:51:13.58 --> 03:51:16.14
And when they picked him up and he got off the airplane

3165
03:51:16.14 --> 03:51:19.62
at Clark Air Force Base after enduring all of that,

3166
03:51:19.62 --> 03:51:22.98
they asked him, there was a microphone set up.

3167
03:51:22.98 --> 03:51:25.86
And if he wanted to say a few words.

3168
03:51:25.86 --> 03:51:30.50
And he gets off the airplane.

3169
03:51:30.50 --> 03:51:37.50
He looks around for his first two or three steps on free soil.

3170
03:51:37.50 --> 03:51:39.62
He walked up to the microphone and he said something

3171
03:51:39.62 --> 03:51:45.94
to me so profound that it epitomizes fellow warriors.

3172
03:51:45.94 --> 03:51:49.30
And now I'm going to say it, but I'm going to choke up

3173
03:51:49.30 --> 03:51:53.66
because I can't try to imagine what he had gone through

3174
03:51:53.66 --> 03:51:58.50
and the words that he spoke that morning at Clark.

3175
03:51:58.50 --> 03:52:03.30
And what he said was, I consider it an honor

3176
03:52:03.30 --> 03:52:08.86
to have had the privilege of serving my country

3177
03:52:08.86 --> 03:52:12.86
under difficult circumstances.

3178
03:52:12.86 --> 03:52:17.94
And I think, God, as long as there's that kind of people

3179
03:52:17.94 --> 03:52:20.54
that look back on that whole thing as an honor

3180
03:52:20.54 --> 03:52:22.82
to serve his country.

3181
03:52:22.82 --> 03:52:27.46
And I think as long as there are those people,

3182
03:52:27.46 --> 03:52:29.90
our flag will still be free.

3183
03:52:33.74 --> 03:52:36.14
Yes, sir.

3184
03:52:36.14 --> 03:52:39.30
Yes, sir, indeed.

3185
03:52:39.30 --> 03:52:42.10
And I don't think I can say anything else beyond that

3186
03:52:42.10 --> 03:52:44.34
other than thank you.

3187
03:52:44.34 --> 03:52:44.94
Thank you, John.

3188
03:52:44.94 --> 03:52:46.70
It's an honor to be here.

3189
03:52:46.70 --> 03:52:48.82
Thank you.

3190
03:52:48.82 --> 03:52:52.82
And with that, Dick Rutan has left the building.

3191
03:52:52.82 --> 03:52:55.38
Also, Dave Burke left the building.

3192
03:52:55.38 --> 03:52:56.50
He's escorting.

3193
03:52:59.30 --> 03:53:02.46
He's escorting Dick Rutan back to the hotel.

3194
03:53:02.46 --> 03:53:09.02
They're probably going to sit and talk about flying for a while.

3195
03:53:09.02 --> 03:53:12.54
So just incredible story.

3196
03:53:12.54 --> 03:53:17.18
Obviously, read the book, get the book.

3197
03:53:17.18 --> 03:53:20.14
The next five minutes, it's called.

3198
03:53:20.14 --> 03:53:23.94
It's just incredible to be able to sit here with a guy like that

3199
03:53:23.94 --> 03:53:29.18
and hear these stories just rolling in to North Vietnam,

3200
03:53:29.18 --> 03:53:37.26
tracers everywhere, locking locking eyes with those enemy

3201
03:53:37.26 --> 03:53:40.70
fighters trying to kill you and doing that day after day

3202
03:53:40.70 --> 03:53:47.78
after day after day after day after day after day.

3203
03:53:47.78 --> 03:53:50.10
That's the American fighting spirit.

3204
03:53:50.10 --> 03:53:51.54

And thanks to him and to all the other military aviators

3270
03:56:47.70 --> 03:56:53.54

3271
03:56:53.54 --> 03:56:56.50
And they pay a heavy price for it.

3272
03:56:56.50 --> 03:56:59.62
And thanks to the rest of our military personnel, who also

3273
03:56:59.62 --> 03:57:02.78
pay the price every day to keep us safe and protect

3274
03:57:02.78 --> 03:57:04.98
our way of life in this great nation.

3275
03:57:04.98 --> 03:57:08.90
And the same goes to the police, law enforcement, firefighters,

You all keep us safe here at home.

3279
03:57:19.26 --> 03:57:20.94
And we thank you for that.

3280
03:57:20.94 --> 03:57:23.26
And to everyone else out there today,

3281
03:57:23.26 --> 03:57:27.18
you heard what Dick Rutan said.

3282
03:57:27.18 --> 03:57:28.50
And he talks about it in the book.

3283
03:57:28.50 --> 03:57:31.58
He talks about what his mother would tell him.

3284
03:57:31.58 --> 03:57:33.50
And at one point in the book we didn't cover today,

3285
03:57:33.50 --> 03:57:35.54
he talks about sometimes when he was facing

3286
03:57:35.54 --> 03:57:39.98
an seemingly insurmountable problem or challenge,

3287
03:57:39.98 --> 03:57:40.78
he would run.

3288
03:57:40.78 --> 03:57:43.34
He would go and run to clear his mind.

3289
03:57:43.34 --> 03:57:46.78
He'd do it for physical fitness, but he did it to clear his mind

3290
03:57:46.78 --> 03:57:49.26
to gain perspective.

3291
03:57:49.26 --> 03:57:51.94
And sometimes he says in the book,

3292
03:57:51.94 --> 03:57:55.46
he would chant that cadence that he spoke of,

3293
03:57:55.46 --> 03:58:00.78
that he learned from his mom, which is, you only fail

3294
03:58:00.78 --> 03:58:03.02
if you quit.

3295
03:58:03.02 --> 03:58:05.70
And that is the truth.

3296
03:58:05.70 --> 03:58:09.50
So go out there.

3297
03:58:09.50 --> 03:58:13.10
Don't quit and keep getting after it.

3298
03:58:13.10 --> 03:58:16.10
And until next time, this is Jaco.

3299
03:58:16.10 --> 03:58:26.10
Out.
