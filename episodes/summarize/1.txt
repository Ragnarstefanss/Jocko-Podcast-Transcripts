And what's interesting is that, like surfing and playing guitar, like that's not easy, you know, it's not, I mean, I'm not going to, I'm not going to talk about golf, but golf is seems like, oh, hey, you just go out and play golf and show some people they get good and great, you know, and it is fun and stuff, but it's not like surfing, you know, and surfing is fun you know what the right thing to do is you know what it is you know it's be disciplined you know it's work hard you know it's put your ego and check you know these things you just got to do you just got to do I think we're close that And I don't want people to think that I sit around and brood all day about the darkness, you know, because I don't, you know, I mean, I love that a good time and laughing and, you know, smile and I want to do that, you know. I say everyone's in a while, uh, you'll hear people going, man, like this country is going like violence or whatever, you know, like going down the jitter or all this stuff. I like the idea that people are really engaged with you online and and they'll ask you questions and you'll essentially confirm like check that that's a good question kind of thing you're engaging I think that's a good thing because these are real questions it's not like questions and we just thought up no that's a great question And then, you know, other people they do have to be reminded, you know, and I think you know what, a powerful reminder because every day, and I would say every minute of every day, I'm thinking about those guys. Yeah, and doesn't that make like, you know, I don't know, a day where you're just kind of cruising to whatever and, you know, looking for a laugh or whatever, and hanging with your friends or whatever. So a person that lacks discipline, they're going to, it's pleasurable, the bars pleasurable, you know, for, you know, generally speaking, TV's pleasurable, so they're going to be all focused on that, like, I don't want to go to bed and face the work day the next day. And so as soon as I realized that, I was like bam, I immediately changed my attitude and I was like, and the next opportunity I had, you know, during a break or something, I was like, you know what? You know, and, and you get these people that are out there that sell courses on developing mental toughness and, you know, they're either going to bring you into a room and get you into some spiritual state and say, okay, listen, you've got to visualize the mind of the wolf and you are going to see it through the eyes of the wolf. And then when you do that, you don't even think about or you don't honestly tell yourself, or think about what you did or what you didn't do, you know, or what you did wrong, you know, to make that, you know, to what role you played. And just like in when you're working with, you know, subordinates and they screw something up, you know, you're, you know, that was a horrible job. But I think a lot of times I'm viewed as like, oh, this is like late riser, like early risers just to begin with kind of seem like these. Doesn't don't those days seem a lot more enjoyable when you do have the darkness in mind, you know, where even, I mean, you know, your kids, so let's, I don't know, your daughter spills the milk and laughs about it. I do my work, I get home at 5 and I, you know, I kind of goof off, watch some TV and maybe, I don't know, maybe even go out to a bar or something like that, where all the work is done, there's no work to be done really. It's like when you're watching a horror movie and, you know, they're like voluntarily, you know, oh, there's a noise down in the basement. Yeah, some more of it, and a challenge and a challenge that it shows when you are good at surfing or not good at surfing shows, you know, seemingly, I don't know, I guess that's just my opinion, but it's always interesting, like the play guitar, sure.
