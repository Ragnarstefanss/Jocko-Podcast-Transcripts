I'm going to look to my left I'm going to look to my right I'm going to assess where my guys are make sure I know that then I'm going to start assessing where the enemy is once I've done that guess what I'm going to do I'm going to make the little littleist move that I can possibly make that's going to move me in the direction that I suspect is the right way to go. The answer is give them less direction and give them the training given the mindset given the authority given the repetitions given the pattern recognition given the standard operating procedure and the immediate action drill and I've talked about this before part of the immediate action drill that you need to have is what you're going to do when you don't know what's going on because there's a process that you can follow when you don't know what is happening what you need to do if I start getting shot at and I don't know what's happening But you can't show pain in mojitai Like literally that's kind of the rule like if you show pain, it's like you fundamentally didn't follow the protocol You know you seem saying it's like an official thing because when they see the pain They're just gonna go if you go oh dang that leg kick hurt even if you just go like this go So you know think about that think about that with your Jiu-jitsu coach your martial arts instructor What is your move gonna do what's your immediate action drill when someone gets in your face when someone grabs you how you gonna break contact and Get away have a good SOP and a good immediate action drill for that All right same thing with boxing by the way, and I right you know when you see a guy in trouble In boxing The examples and if you go deep and deep, the stories of guys charging machine guns nests weren't waiting for the commander to come down and say, charge the machine gun nests, you're actually, if you have that level of trust, you are so front and front, I don't need job to tell me that because I actually know you may, I know you may come down to tell, but I know that's going to happen before you come down and tell me to men get online. There's a decent chance it's gonna work Unfortunately once that initial wall is over if you're not ready to adapt to that person that Cavers up grabs a hole to your whatever and start some maneuver on you well than you're you have a problem So there's a there's a chance it's gonna work but you have to be able to adapt afterwards Same thing in a firefight, you know someone starts shooting you we know the the Vietnam guys taught us And have closed environment like the jungle where there's no other friendly forces around and you're in a squad of See a squad of seals of eight guys you get contacted everyone drops down in their field of fire and dumb Samagging tilt was talking about that the friends when we're talking about that they would drop down Man We must be able to do both and this is one of those things where I was listening to As in a Jordan Peterson yesterday and He was talking about how there's like the creative people and then the other side of the spectrum is I don't know the conscientious people and and most people are either creative or their conscientious Conscientious meaning that they'll do what they're told they'll do it to the best of their ability They're very duty-focused They're very reliable the creative people obviously are like none of those things and and he was saying Creative people are poor so this is the other form the second basic way to adapt is to improvise to adjust to a situation on the spur of the moment without any Preparation like anticipation improvisation is the key to maneuver is key to maneuver warfare Improvisation requires creative intelligence Intelligent and experienced leaders who have an intuition Intuitive appreciation for what will work and what will not Improvisation is of critical importance to increasing speed it requires commanders who have his strong situational awareness and a firm understanding of their senior commanders intense so that they can adjust their own actions in accordance with the higher commanders desires Often we will find ourselves in a situation where our organic resources weapons vehicles and so on are not adequate to keep us moving fast in France 1940 German general Heinz Guirdian put some of his infantry in common deered French buses On Grenada when army Rangers needed vehicles they took East German trucks belonging to the Grenadian army Sound on north of the box there is nothing Orthodox about failure due to an inability to adapt Improvisation and this is one of those ones where You this is where you start to see a Leader that can't that doesn't have the creative aspect to his thought process This is where you see when when the situation demands true improvisation This is where you see a little crack in the in the armor of the highly Concernions conscientious leader. Each situation is a unique combination of shifting factors that cannot be controlled with precision or certainty This chapter discusses ways to think about adapting or modifying our decisions based on changed circumstances or sudden opportunities Attractically proficient leader must be able to adapt actions to each situation the Utilup discussed in chapter four essentially describes the process of adaptation We observe the situation oriented to it decide what to do and act the antagonist who can consistently adapt more quickly to the situation We'll have a significant advantage adaptability is thus an important part of marine cortex There's something you don't think of every day that adaptability is literally part of marine cortex In essence adaptability means shortening the time it takes to adjust to each new situation We see this with businesses all the time businesses that either Adapt and win or don't adapt and lose I talked about this a lot when we would have You'd have a tactical situation SOPs for For your actions when you didn't know what to do so if you looked at a situation and didn't really understand what you should do You still have to do something going wings level and flying shit head is a death sentence So our SOP for reaction to being shot out was what we called lift vector on and pull basically means point of the guy pull as hard as you can We let's pull do pull closes the distance between the two views and moves the airplane from the piece of Scott that you're into some other piece of Sky and makes the closure happen as fast as you can to try to minimize the distance What you're trying to create a separation I remember the puzzle kind of curious look on this face when I am telling him, just because he hadn't really experienced before like, listen, I trust that you are going to make the right decision you are going to make things happen. It's quickly as possible because if I extend away from that or do nothing You get more opportunity to get to more advantageous position But me pulling directly towards you isn't the right answer I don't know what the right if I knew what the right answer was I wouldn't be here in the first place So my SOP is I have to close the distance right away and the good pilots The amount of time was sometimes would take a half a second for they adjust that maneuver that you try to have to kind of have to have or if you really want to take it to the next level Back to the book anticipation the first basic way to adapt is to anticipate by which we mean to Introduce new method schemes and techniques for future use In order to anticipate we must be able to forecast future actions at least to some extent Our forecasts are usually based on past experiences often a forecast involves considering what we learned through trial and error In training exercises or actual combat and Excellent example of anticipation is the Marine Corps development of amphibious warfare techniques at Quantico During the 1920s and 30s these techniques proved to be essential to the success in World War II in both the Pacific and in Europe All planning at all echelons is a form of anticipatory Participation adaptation adapting our actions in advance another important tool for tactical adaptation is the use of immediate action drills or standard operating procedures Why do I always call it standard operating? so if I get separation from you I can attack you and I if on the defender I want to close that separation and bring that fight down as close as I can But the reality is that me putting my lift vector on and pulling towards you isn't the right answer What I actually need to do is figure out I apply that SOP and as soon as I do that I need to engage my brain to think okay, now where do I need to really go which is maybe up an actress or some other reaction The SOP in an airplane was that maneuver which is no different than dump your mag I mean I think it means foreign The rest early or just I won't say super positive, but no, it's it's Because you know when you go to Thailand and the fallong's go to they's the the fallong like a drunk European dude Is off like that little tie guy put me in the ring with him and they go okay? When you hear me say, flank, I am not going to tell you where to go, but you know what you know what I mean when I say flank, I mean I want you to go on a straight, mergers free right now. I I will up the level of spice sure one to 10 at the Thai restaurant that I go to and over a year I went you know from five to seven to nine one time I went in there and nine You know no factor eight no factor like taste good Yeah, that's that's the probably the biggest Thing that App holds people from adapting is there they're not they're just their ego so big that they're thinking I'm ready to change People who aren't humble can't change period because they think they got everything figured out that got everything right and they don't change and That's the recipe for failure. I'm going to lose some of my men to do that and that burden of doing that, think about how much trust is required from the leadership side to cultivate a response from my subordinates who know their men are going to die. But they get like tapped out at a certain point Because they don't have that spark of creativity that they can look at a rapidly changing situation and go I know what we're gonna do So Occasionally and and and a lot of times those people that are creative are too creative for the military and they end up leaving because they can't stand the constraints that are put on them Well, and I think you just described as, is you're going to immediately back into the Udolub to orient yourself to what's going on, decide what you're going to do next and act. But if I was fighting against a guy who was at my level or better there are times he would do things that I had to react to and The time frame that takes me to react to an SOP to the right thing the short of that time frame the more likely is I'm gonna be successful and if I don't know what to do They take him like even more leg kicks to that same leg every time it's like That's the SOP you see little little pain on the guys face whatever you just keep hitting that thing And it's good thing to think about from a self defense perspective martial arts wise like you should have some standard operating procedures some immediate action drills That you're gonna do that are just gonna get you I would think that like in like the natural world that the intuition is going to be correct. How often do we see the, the, the leader that thinks that the more detail they put into a plan, the better off they're going to be and the better people are going to understand it all the time. Hey, when we set the breach here, that's going to drive people in this direction, out of the building, if they try to escape, they're going to go off this back door, this back window, boom, we'll be waiting right there for them or whatever.
