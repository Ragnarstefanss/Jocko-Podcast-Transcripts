00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.56 This is Jockel podcast number 195 with echo Charles and me jockel willink
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening echo good evening
00:00:11.52 --> 00:00:13.52 Time
00:00:14.88 --> 00:00:23.24 Is supposed to be a constant the day is a day and an hour is an hour and a second
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:26.52 Is supposed to be a second
00:00:26.52 --> 00:00:32.52 At least that's the way it's supposed to be
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:40.52 And you get one life made up of years hopefully
00:00:42.52 --> 00:00:44.52 That stack up on top of one another
00:00:44.52 --> 00:00:53.52 And they are all supposed to measure the same amount of time those years
00:00:56.52 --> 00:00:58.52 But they don't always do that
00:01:01.52 --> 00:01:05.52 There are days that seem to last forever
00:01:08.52 --> 00:01:10.52 There are seconds
00:01:10.52 --> 00:01:18.52 That's stall and remain suspended in some kind of bizarre slow motion
00:01:22.52 --> 00:01:28.52 And that's the way life actually is parts of it are bigger than other parts
00:01:31.52 --> 00:01:35.52 They have more impact the time continuum gets expanded
00:01:35.52 --> 00:01:46.52 And hyper awareness drags out the hours and the days and they be even indelible impression
00:01:49.52 --> 00:01:50.52 On your soul
00:01:53.52 --> 00:01:57.52 And it could be a good thing that causes this maybe it was
00:01:58.52 --> 00:02:01.52 Maybe it was winning the championship game in high school
00:02:01.52 --> 00:02:11.52 Maybe it was surfing your first wave or your first parachute jump or maybe it was holding your newborn child for the first time
00:02:16.52 --> 00:02:18.52 But maybe it was a bad thing
00:02:20.52 --> 00:02:21.52 Car accident
00:02:23.52 --> 00:02:24.52 A fire
00:02:24.52 --> 00:02:31.52 Being told someone you had a major health issue
00:02:34.52 --> 00:02:42.52 Perhaps it was that moment when you were told that one of your loved ones had died
00:02:44.52 --> 00:02:48.52 You remember where you were the words you heard
00:02:48.52 --> 00:02:53.52 And you remember the anguish you felt
00:02:57.52 --> 00:02:59.52 And these incidents
00:03:02.52 --> 00:03:04.52 Good or bad they leave a mark
00:03:08.52 --> 00:03:11.52 Most of these incidents are short maybe a few minutes maybe an hour
00:03:11.52 --> 00:03:16.52 Maybe it stretches out to a day
00:03:19.52 --> 00:03:27.52 But in combat you experienced these kind of impactful moments day after day week after week month after month
00:03:27.52 --> 00:03:39.52 You regularly faced with highly charged emotions and life and death situations and shots of adrenaline
00:03:41.52 --> 00:03:45.52 They don't get much sleep and the food is horrible
00:03:47.52 --> 00:03:52.52 And you live under the constant for boating weight of one of your men being wounded or killed and it doesn't stop
00:03:52.52 --> 00:03:57.52 It doesn't let up
00:03:59.52 --> 00:04:04.52 And the end of one operation is actually only just the beginning of another one
00:04:05.52 --> 00:04:07.52 Each one with its own risk
00:04:10.52 --> 00:04:13.52 And each one with its own reward
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:20.52 And that risk and that reward is what you begin to live off of like a gambling addict
00:04:21.52 --> 00:04:23.52 That can't walk away from the table
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:25.52 You can't bring yourself to walk away
00:04:32.52 --> 00:04:33.52 So
00:04:34.52 --> 00:04:36.52 You carry on
00:04:36.52 --> 00:04:47.52 And eventually you and the men by your side have lived life times worth of life in a matter of months
00:04:52.52 --> 00:04:53.52 And those men
00:04:54.52 --> 00:04:57.52 The ones that survive become your brothers
00:04:57.52 --> 00:05:02.52 And the ones that don't survive
00:05:03.52 --> 00:05:04.52 Become your heroes
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:17.52 And that part of your life
00:05:17.52 --> 00:05:25.52 That part of your life becomes the standard to which all other parts are measured
00:05:30.52 --> 00:05:33.52 Because when you're holding a machine gun in your hands
00:05:35.52 --> 00:05:37.52 And you're with your brothers in arms
00:05:37.52 --> 00:05:45.52 And there are other men out there with guns and bombs of their own and they're looking to kill you
00:05:49.52 --> 00:05:56.52 When your whole world can be reduced to what is happening right here right now in this moment
00:06:00.52 --> 00:06:03.52 When you experience that
00:06:03.52 --> 00:06:06.52 Then other
00:06:07.52 --> 00:06:11.52 So-called normal things can seem mundane
00:06:17.52 --> 00:06:18.52 And yet
00:06:20.52 --> 00:06:21.52 You carry on
00:06:21.52 --> 00:06:31.52 You carry on with life with work with family, with birthdays and barbecues and the days tick by
00:06:34.52 --> 00:06:35.52 And you get a little older
00:06:38.52 --> 00:06:40.52 And when you pause
00:06:41.52 --> 00:06:44.52 You can even see the end up there in the distance
00:06:44.52 --> 00:06:51.52 Still far enough off that you don't need to think about it too much
00:06:52.52 --> 00:06:55.52 But close enough to let you know it's there
00:06:57.52 --> 00:07:01.52 And you know you already got more time than you deserved
00:07:04.52 --> 00:07:07.52 Than you're thankful for that
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:13.52 And in your mind you can still picture the faces of those
00:07:16.52 --> 00:07:18.52 Who will not grow old
00:07:22.52 --> 00:07:24.52 Then they gave this to you
00:07:24.52 --> 00:07:33.52 Those times and those men made you who you are
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:41.52 And you're thankful thankful that you knew those men
00:07:42.52 --> 00:07:45.52 thankful that you got those moments
00:07:46.52 --> 00:07:48.52 All of those moments
00:07:48.52 --> 00:07:52.52 The exhilaration
00:07:53.52 --> 00:07:55.52 And the terror
00:07:56.52 --> 00:07:58.52 The joy and the despair
00:08:00.52 --> 00:08:01.52 The pride
00:08:02.52 --> 00:08:04.52 And the humility
00:08:07.52 --> 00:08:10.52 You're thankful you got to experience it all
00:08:10.52 --> 00:08:17.52 And like I said that experience leaves
00:08:18.52 --> 00:08:20.52 And leaves a mark
00:08:24.52 --> 00:08:26.52 It changes you
00:08:27.52 --> 00:08:29.52 It changes you in some way
00:08:29.52 --> 00:08:37.52 I was reading recently and I came across this
00:08:41.52 --> 00:08:45.52 My old self and new self weren't compatible
00:08:47.52 --> 00:08:49.52 I felt awkward
00:08:50.52 --> 00:08:53.52 I missed my men badly
00:08:53.52 --> 00:08:58.52 I felt a sense of loss at the same time
00:08:59.52 --> 00:09:01.52 I felt guilt and shame
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:05.52 It shouldn't have taken the army to wake me up
00:09:06.52 --> 00:09:08.52 To the shallow life I had
00:09:09.52 --> 00:09:13.52 Right then I knew coming home was going to be much harder on me than I had expected
00:09:15.52 --> 00:09:17.52 I wanted to run
00:09:17.52 --> 00:09:22.52 I find a place just for me and figure this all out in beautiful solitude
00:09:25.52 --> 00:09:27.52 My old life was gone
00:09:28.52 --> 00:09:30.52 Dead
00:09:31.52 --> 00:09:36.52 Burned away by mortar fire and the sonic crack of AK rounds passing overhead
00:09:36.52 --> 00:09:43.52 I began to wonder if any of it could be saved
00:09:47.52 --> 00:09:50.52 Could I take the pieces with me into the future
00:09:52.52 --> 00:09:56.52 Or was I going to have to rebuild from scratch?
00:09:56.52 --> 00:10:00.52 I was going to have to build a place
00:10:02.52 --> 00:10:07.52 And that is from a book called Outlaw Platoon
00:10:10.52 --> 00:10:17.52 Written by a soldier, a ranger, a leader, an infantry officer
00:10:18.52 --> 00:10:22.52 And a platoon commander in the hollowed 10th mountain division
00:10:22.52 --> 00:10:27.52 You now have to gain a stand in 2006, 2007 and on top of all that
00:10:30.52 --> 00:10:32.52 A father, a speaker
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:37.52 And an author of several books, a guy by the name of
00:10:39.52 --> 00:10:45.52 Sean Parnell and we are lucky enough today to have Sean with us on the podcast
00:10:46.52 --> 00:10:49.52 Sean, thanks for coming on man
00:10:49.52 --> 00:10:53.52 It's great to be here, I'm excited to be here
00:10:54.52 --> 00:10:56.52 Yeah, reading your book
00:10:57.52 --> 00:11:00.52 Definitely brought back a lot of memories for me
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:04.52 And I never fought in Afghanistan, I'm fought in Iraq
00:11:05.52 --> 00:11:11.52 But man, you really captured a lot, you captured the pressure
00:11:11.52 --> 00:11:18.52 You captured the grind, you captured the drama, you captured the politics
00:11:20.52 --> 00:11:27.52 And it was very interesting, I was probably about 50 pages in
00:11:28.52 --> 00:11:30.52 And the curtain message, when is this taken place?
00:11:31.52 --> 00:11:34.52 I kind of missed the very first things, I went back to the beginning
00:11:35.52 --> 00:11:37.52 Just to read that opening line to find out when it was
00:11:37.52 --> 00:11:42.52 The first thing took place and the bulk of the fighting took place in 2006
00:11:43.52 --> 00:11:46.52 And the summer of 2006, which is exactly when I was in Ramadi
00:11:47.52 --> 00:11:51.52 So you were going through what you were going through
00:11:52.52 --> 00:11:55.52 The same exact time I was over in Ramadi, we were both fighting the same thing in different theaters
00:11:56.52 --> 00:11:57.52 Different countries
00:11:58.52 --> 00:12:00.52 Yeah, and I think I just learned that now
00:12:01.52 --> 00:12:05.52 But I remember hearing in Afghanistan that Ramadi was like
00:12:05.52 --> 00:12:09.52 I was like, you know, in 2006, I was really, really tough time
00:12:10.52 --> 00:12:15.52 And this was around the time when Americans flipped on their TV sets
00:12:16.52 --> 00:12:19.52 And watched newscasters talk about the surge day in and day out
00:12:20.52 --> 00:12:22.52 Remember that, like the surge was the big policy debate on Capitol Hill
00:12:23.52 --> 00:12:25.52 All this, the head and executor, they were talking about
00:12:26.52 --> 00:12:30.52 They didn't execute it until 2007, when we were supposed to go home
00:12:30.52 --> 00:12:35.52 We were in, but they sent the unit to replace us over to Iraq as part and support of the surge
00:12:36.52 --> 00:12:39.52 But, you know, they had their own battles, wage and on Capitol Hill and we were wage and on our own
00:12:40.52 --> 00:12:44.52 Our own life and death battles and Afghanistan and Iraq at the exact same time, you know
00:12:45.52 --> 00:12:51.52 Yeah, yeah, but yeah, you did a, you did a ridiculously good job with this book
00:12:52.52 --> 00:12:55.52 I was, I read it really fast
00:12:55.52 --> 00:13:01.52 And I mean, let's just get into it, man, sure. Let's just get into it
00:13:03.52 --> 00:13:06.52 Here we go, outlawed tune
00:13:09.52 --> 00:13:11.52 Staff Sergeant Greg Greason
00:13:12.52 --> 00:13:17.52 Lieutenant Taylor's weapon squad leader shouted, shouted us, incoming, get inside the wire now
00:13:18.52 --> 00:13:22.52 His words act like ice water to the face, Lieutenant Taylor and I sprinted our sergeants
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:24.52 After our sergeants and back to the fob
00:13:26.52 --> 00:13:30.52 With our new home at 7,000 feet, it took a few seconds before my lungs started to burn
00:13:31.52 --> 00:13:36.52 From lack of oxygen, I stopped the concrete pad next to my gear and watched Greason and the other sergeants
00:13:37.52 --> 00:13:41.52 Dash off toward the battalion aid station, Taylor bolted into the Operation Center
00:13:42.52 --> 00:13:47.52 What the hell do I do? I felt rooted in place, observing the action around me with yet
00:13:47.52 --> 00:13:51.52 With no purpose of my own, Captain Kennedy, am I saying that right?
00:13:52.52 --> 00:13:56.52 Yes, Captain Kennedy ran into view, some kids got hit with those rounds, they're at the front gate
00:13:57.52 --> 00:14:01.52 My legs started to move, I felt myself run after Kennedy
00:14:02.52 --> 00:14:07.52 Wanting to go faster but feeling an impenetrable wall between will and action
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:14.52 We rounded a corner, perhaps 50 yards away, I could see some of the 173rd airborne soldiers opening the front gate
00:14:14.52 --> 00:14:19.52 Crying to straw at Afghan civilians poured into the base, I kept running
00:14:20.52 --> 00:14:24.52 Then I saw the kids, I heard their screams, a few thrashed in agony
00:14:25.52 --> 00:14:26.52 Others lay still in their parents' arms
00:14:27.52 --> 00:14:31.52 I dropped my rifle, pulled my helmet off and dumped my body armor in the dirt
00:14:32.52 --> 00:14:34.52 And sprinted the last stretch to the scene
00:14:35.52 --> 00:14:40.52 One of the interpreters was shouting at an angry father, two more Afghan dads ganged up on him yelling insistently
00:14:40.52 --> 00:14:44.52 Finally, a soldier demanded Abdul, what the hell are they saying?
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:51.52 Abdul, his face, a mask of rage replied, they're telling me to make sure that boys get treated before the girls
00:14:52.52 --> 00:14:57.52 Get them all to the retaliation, Abdul turned to the fathers and passed the order to them
00:14:58.52 --> 00:15:00.52 They shook their heads and shouted them again
00:15:01.52 --> 00:15:07.52 Abdul announced they refused, they want the boys treated first, grab them all the soldiers, the soldier roared again
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:11.52 The other men at the gate picked up some of the wounded kids, perhaps seven were still alive
00:15:12.52 --> 00:15:16.52 I scooped up the nearest child and turned to follow the other soldiers as they dash for the aid station
00:15:17.52 --> 00:15:21.52 I taken a half of the dozen steps before I realized I had a little girl in my arms
00:15:22.52 --> 00:15:26.52 I looked down at her, she wore a tan dress that felt like burlap in my hands
00:15:27.52 --> 00:15:31.52 The collar was ornate, red and green with little designs that converged on a v-neck
00:15:32.52 --> 00:15:33.52 She felt so light
00:15:33.52 --> 00:15:36.52 It's okay, it's okay, I said to her
00:15:37.52 --> 00:15:39.52 Her eyes were bright, emerald green, deep and filled with pain
00:15:40.52 --> 00:15:44.52 Her raven hair was displayed across her face and plastered to her skin by her tears
00:15:45.52 --> 00:15:49.52 She keened hysterically, pain racked and panicked
00:15:50.52 --> 00:15:54.52 Her pitch hurt my ears, I kept running, her head and shoulders cradled in my left hand
00:15:55.52 --> 00:15:58.52 Her slight body pressed against my ribs, hip and thigh, and my right forearm
00:15:59.52 --> 00:16:01.52 Her left flank, her left hand, flailed
00:16:01.52 --> 00:16:06.52 She gasped, then screamed again, it seemed to never end, it's okay, it's okay
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:12.52 I began to wonder who I was talking to, the girl or myself
00:16:13.52 --> 00:16:18.52 Keep running, her breathing grew ragged, her screams choppy, I glanced down at her
00:16:19.52 --> 00:16:22.52 Her eyes were growing dull, she stared up at me, this stranger in uniform
00:16:23.52 --> 00:16:25.52 And I could see the terror in those fading eyes
00:16:25.52 --> 00:16:28.52 With my right hand, I tried to brush her hair off her face
00:16:28.52 --> 00:16:31.52 Instead, my fingers smeared blood across her cheek
00:16:32.52 --> 00:16:35.52 I sensed the warmth on my thigh, what was that?
00:16:35.52 --> 00:16:37.52 I wanted to look down, but something stopped me
00:16:38.52 --> 00:16:41.52 My legs carried us forward, an autopilot mode as I fixed
00:16:41.52 --> 00:16:45.52 As my eyes fixed on hers, she screamed again, horse and weak this time
00:16:46.52 --> 00:16:49.52 The warmth spread to my hip and trickled past my knee
00:16:49.52 --> 00:16:54.52 I couldn't bear to look, when I did, my brain didn't register what my eyes saw
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:59.52 One barefoot, tiny delicate toes, covered in brown dust
00:17:00.52 --> 00:17:02.52 Crimson dots splattered on her cocky dress
00:17:03.52 --> 00:17:05.52 Which now rode high above her knees
00:17:05.52 --> 00:17:08.52 Tendrils of torn burnt flesh taper below the other knee
00:17:08.52 --> 00:17:13.52 To a bleeding stump, a white stripe of bone projected through the ruined skin and muscle
00:17:15.52 --> 00:17:18.52 I lost my stride and looked up to regain my balance
00:17:19.52 --> 00:17:22.52 The little girl uttered a deep guttural cry
00:17:22.52 --> 00:17:28.52 One step, a second, perhaps a third before I realized she wasn't screaming anymore
00:17:29.52 --> 00:17:32.52 Aid station, we have to make it to the aid station
00:17:32.52 --> 00:17:36.52 It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, her hand fell away
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:42.52 Her neck grew slack in my cradling hand, this is not happening
00:17:42.52 --> 00:17:45.52 How long did it take me to look down at her again?
00:17:46.52 --> 00:17:49.52 Her breast grew shallow, the warmth continued to spread
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:54.52 I looked down, her fear was gone, the spark in her eyes snuffed out
00:17:57.52 --> 00:18:01.52 The world around me went on, soldiers ran, parents cried,
00:18:01.52 --> 00:18:04.52 Abdul argued, Kennedy barked orders
00:18:06.52 --> 00:18:09.52 And I held a dead child in my arms
00:18:10.52 --> 00:18:13.52 I sleep walked back to her parents
00:18:13.52 --> 00:18:19.52 Her mother, clad in a black berk, a cover to face, sobbed into her hands
00:18:20.52 --> 00:18:22.52 Her father regarded me stoically
00:18:24.52 --> 00:18:27.52 I realized that this little girl had inherited his green eyes
00:18:29.52 --> 00:18:31.52 I handed him his daughter's body
00:18:32.52 --> 00:18:36.52 He turned and walked through the gate, her barefoot
00:18:36.52 --> 00:18:43.52 Those tiny sculpted toes dangled limply by his side
00:18:44.52 --> 00:18:49.52 I watched them go stripped of words
00:18:54.52 --> 00:18:56.52 So there's your welcome to Afghanistan
00:18:57.52 --> 00:19:00.52 All that on day one
00:19:00.52 --> 00:19:07.52 I mean, for me, that was the moment that began inside my self
00:19:08.52 --> 00:19:13.52 I met a morpher, where one of the things that struck me about that moment
00:19:14.52 --> 00:19:18.52 was that here, I have a moment that is so jarring
00:19:19.52 --> 00:19:23.52 Took me to my core, if I was affected me to the very soul of the man that I was
00:19:24.52 --> 00:19:26.52 And the world just kept ticking around you
00:19:26.52 --> 00:19:31.52 You know, the war, almost as if the world didn't even notice this little girl had died
00:19:32.52 --> 00:19:34.52 And my very first day there
00:19:35.52 --> 00:19:39.52 And I remember bringing her back to her father, him stoically nodding at me
00:19:40.52 --> 00:19:42.52 And I remember going back to my room
00:19:43.52 --> 00:19:48.52 That my newly assigned hooch, right, of these just like plywood walls
00:19:49.52 --> 00:19:51.52 And I got a little bunk and a little desk for my computer
00:19:51.52 --> 00:19:55.52 I was the patoon that I was a little laptop there, picture my grandparents
00:19:56.52 --> 00:19:59.52 And I just remember sitting against the corner of my bunk
00:20:00.52 --> 00:20:02.52 And this bloodstained uniform
00:20:04.52 --> 00:20:06.52 For what felt like hours, right?
00:20:07.52 --> 00:20:10.52 And I remember being sick to my stomach, take off that uniform, put on my PT's
00:20:11.52 --> 00:20:14.52 And tent to go to my tent was to go to the gym, blow off some steam
00:20:15.52 --> 00:20:18.52 But I couldn't bring myself to do it, just stared at that uniform
00:20:18.52 --> 00:20:24.52 On the floor of my hooch and I just like how trying to ask, you know, trying to
00:20:25.52 --> 00:20:29.52 I feel like answer a pretty simple question
00:20:30.52 --> 00:20:31.52 And that we know I was 24 years old
00:20:32.52 --> 00:20:34.52 I had never been in charge of anything before my entire life
00:20:35.52 --> 00:20:39.52 The job that I had before the one that I had right now was, you know, history major
00:20:40.52 --> 00:20:45.52 You know, the biggest responsibility that I had before
00:20:45.52 --> 00:20:49.52 I was just taking over that pontoon was trying to get the class on time
00:20:50.52 --> 00:20:53.52 And I just remember asking myself over and over and over again is like, how
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:58.52 How am I supposed to experience things like that?
00:20:59.52 --> 00:21:00.52 Moments like that
00:21:02.52 --> 00:21:04.52 But then lead my men with confidence
00:21:05.52 --> 00:21:09.52 Be the decisive leader that they deserved, right?
00:21:10.52 --> 00:21:12.52 That they were trained to expect
00:21:12.52 --> 00:21:17.52 They deserved a leader that could handle moments like that
00:21:18.52 --> 00:21:21.52 And endure, you know, and I couldn't figure it out
00:21:22.52 --> 00:21:23.52 And I really never
00:21:24.52 --> 00:21:29.52 I don't feel like I ever had a healthy answer to that question
00:21:30.52 --> 00:21:32.52 The way that I answered it in that moment was like, I'm just going to
00:21:33.52 --> 00:21:38.52 Take this experience and lock it away deep in the deepest recesses of myself
00:21:38.52 --> 00:21:41.52 And my mind and my consciousness and never talk about it again
00:21:42.52 --> 00:21:44.52 Pretend like it didn't happen
00:21:45.52 --> 00:21:46.52 Flip that emotional switch
00:21:47.52 --> 00:21:51.52 You know, shield myself from the pain of it
00:21:52.52 --> 00:21:57.52 And let's, you know, to me, like, you know, this is not like a by the way
00:21:58.52 --> 00:22:00.52 This is not a poor me store, I volunteered for this, I do it all again
00:22:01.52 --> 00:22:03.52 And a second, I don't regret a single second of my experience
00:22:03.52 --> 00:22:08.52 The military does a damn good job training you to go, shoot, rifle, and stuff
00:22:09.52 --> 00:22:12.52 Train your men, shoot, move and communicate together, great, awesome, whoah, I love it
00:22:13.52 --> 00:22:14.52 Every second of it
00:22:15.52 --> 00:22:17.52 But nothing can prepare you a young 24 year old kid
00:22:18.52 --> 00:22:19.52 You never left the country for a moment like that
00:22:20.52 --> 00:22:23.52 You know, it just changes who you are to the very core of who you are
00:22:24.52 --> 00:22:26.52 And so, yeah, I pretended like it didn't happen
00:22:27.52 --> 00:22:28.52 I remember scooping that uniform up
00:22:29.52 --> 00:22:31.52 Walking it outside of my base
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:35.52 Throwing it in this burn pit on my first night in Afghanistan
00:22:36.52 --> 00:22:37.52 I watched that bloody uniform burn
00:22:38.52 --> 00:22:40.52 And inside me, and I think looking back
00:22:41.52 --> 00:22:45.52 Inside me, I remember feeling like, okay, there's some sort of metamorphosis happening here
00:22:46.52 --> 00:22:50.52 And I look back now, it's almost as if in a very literal sense
00:22:51.52 --> 00:22:55.52 I was shedding this sort of insular state side skin that I had in the form of that bloody uniform
00:22:56.52 --> 00:22:57.52 So I'm not the same person anymore
00:22:57.52 --> 00:23:01.52 You know, the same guy that like went drinking with his buddies every Thursday, Thursday
00:23:02.52 --> 00:23:07.52 And the streets of Pittsburgh, like that guy is not, there's not not the same person anymore
00:23:08.52 --> 00:23:11.52 And that experience
00:23:12.52 --> 00:23:17.52 What really was, was the beginning of a metamorphosis inside me from
00:23:18.52 --> 00:23:23.52 An insulated American citizen to warrior combat veteran
00:23:23.52 --> 00:23:28.52 And that was the first of 485 days of absolute hell
00:23:29.52 --> 00:23:34.52 And hell, I mean, I don't lose a wink of sleep over the things that we did over there
00:23:35.52 --> 00:23:37.52 I'm proud of every second of it, you know, there are a lot of people that
00:23:38.52 --> 00:23:41.52 That we took off the face of this planet that didn't deserve to live, you know
00:23:42.52 --> 00:23:44.52 They made their living praying on the week
00:23:45.52 --> 00:23:48.52 And they didn't deserve the life that they have and I'm proud of the stuff that we did
00:23:48.52 --> 00:23:52.52 We never heard civilians, it was always the kids and kids and civilians that were caught in the middle
00:23:53.52 --> 00:23:58.52 That you remember and think about and that first experience at first day, every single day of my life
00:23:59.52 --> 00:24:02.52 I think about that, you know, I've got three amazing little kids in my own
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:10.52 And you know, it's like, I can, this might sound, it probably won't sound strange to you
00:24:10.52 --> 00:24:17.52 But, you know, I look in the eyes of my kids and there's like this spark of vitality there, right?
00:24:18.52 --> 00:24:25.52 That I almost envy in a lot of ways, it's not a quote, in a sense called, you know, insulated existence in the best country in the face of planet
00:24:26.52 --> 00:24:30.52 I don't know, but I feel like I look in the mirror myself and I don't have that anymore
00:24:31.52 --> 00:24:37.52 And I remember watching that little, that little girl on my first day and her past from this earth
00:24:37.52 --> 00:24:39.52 And what she did, she didn't have that anymore either
00:24:40.52 --> 00:24:42.52 And so
00:24:42.52 --> 00:24:45.52 There's not a day that goes by that I don't
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:49.52 Think about that little af gang girl and and how she
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:55.52 She changed me in some way that experience changed me in some way and how that in some way connects to
00:24:56.52 --> 00:25:00.52 My own kids in the type of father, I'll be, I don't know, I don't have answers to any of these questions
00:25:01.52 --> 00:25:02.52 But
00:25:02.52 --> 00:25:12.52 It's kind of crazy man, like I haven't, I haven't cracked that book since it's since I've finished writing it, you know, and so to hear it, here you read it here now
00:25:13.52 --> 00:25:17.52 It's almost like surreal to me, it gives me goosebumps because it brings back my experience so it's so close to home
00:25:19.52 --> 00:25:25.52 But yeah, I mean, sometimes I forget getting farther and farther away from the war, how much it really did affect me
00:25:25.52 --> 00:25:38.52 I'm sort of lucky in the fact that I was old like when I was a task unit commander when I was a
00:25:39.52 --> 00:25:46.52 Petune commander in Iraq, I was like 30 something years old when I was a task unit commander in Iraq, I'd been in the teams for 15 years
00:25:46.52 --> 00:25:55.52 June I'm saying like that and yeah, I got really lucky in that regard, you know, as a prime and listed guy, so I ate years of being enlisted
00:25:56.52 --> 00:26:05.52 Yeah, you got thrown right in it, you know, and there's been quite a few guys I've had on this podcast, I know I had James a web on here and he went from
00:26:05.52 --> 00:26:21.52 from OC from the Academy to the basic school, got done with the basic school, had whatever 12 days of leave, got to Vietnam, they brought him out on a patrol, they pointed it a ridge line and they said your potunes up there
00:26:22.52 --> 00:26:31.52 He walked up to his potune and he took over a potune and there was no one to replace because the guy that he was replacing was either killed or wounded so there was a sergeant running the
00:26:31.52 --> 00:26:46.52 He said yep, he said him, you know, first lieutenant web, I'm here to take over and yeah, here we go and then that night they had a massive firefight and he had to call for closer support and everything else
00:26:46.52 --> 00:26:59.52 See it was he an army guy, Marine Corps, some Marine Corps army, I mean I feel like even Marine Corps they send I mean first lieutenant right, you get to be able to in command of the Marine Corps, I think it first lieutenant like only the army where they send the brand new butter bars and the
00:27:00.52 --> 00:27:14.52 Second lieutenant, I was in Vietnam, yeah, it might have been actually was, but I mean isn't it it's just I just find that to be you know, I had I mean I look I I'm telling you right now I had absolutely no idea what the hell I was doing when I got to my
00:27:14.52 --> 00:27:22.52 Patoon and I wasn't even I wasn't even an infantry lieutenant like one of the 16 or so branches at the time of the army infantry was one of them I asked for it
00:27:23.52 --> 00:27:27.52 I didn't get it I ended up begging borrowin and steal my way into the infantry
00:27:28.52 --> 00:27:33.52 I think there's a leadership lesson there, but I ended up begging to get into that branch I did I had no infantry training whatsoever
00:27:34.52 --> 00:27:39.52 When I took over my Patoon they sent me like I got basically a call from my infantry branch manager saying like
00:27:39.52 --> 00:27:45.52 You know hey congratulations, you know you got your brands transferred infantry you're going to range or school in February and I was like oh
00:27:46.52 --> 00:27:51.52 Shit, it's like I went to range or school failed the first time like you know pretty much I do everything and I failed the first time
00:27:52.52 --> 00:27:58.52 Begg the commander to stay he let me stay I resikle I go back and I make it through and I get sent to my Patoon and I took over my Patoon
00:27:58.52 --> 00:28:01.52 No infantry experience whatsoever. I wrote sort of the black sheep at the beginning
00:28:02.52 --> 00:28:06.52 Other than range or school. Other than range or school. Yeah, I mean, but I mean solid baseline
00:28:06.52 --> 00:28:16.52 Well the officer basic course for infantry guys is 16 weeks right and so they they get 16 weeks of what is essentially orders writing and Ranger prep and all those I was an heir to fence artillery guy
00:28:17.52 --> 00:28:18.52 We didn't get any of that stuff
00:28:18.52 --> 00:28:24.52 It was just like what we trained on I was sure at short range you know Aaron missile defense short range out of fence and
00:28:25.52 --> 00:28:30.22 Infantry battoons don't carry stangers anymore. I'm pretty sure she'll you see your team's don't carry stangers anymore. I don't just thank her school
00:28:31.52 --> 00:28:34.52 So that's what's that in Texas
00:28:34.52 --> 00:28:40.52 Yes, I was in El Paso. Yes, yes, yes, we're my first studio assignment, but that yeah, but I end that I'm getting to my unit at the 10th mountain division
00:28:41.52 --> 00:28:47.52 I didn't have any infantry training whatsoever, so it was like talk about walking into an experience like okay, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut
00:28:48.52 --> 00:28:53.52 Yeah, big guys big ears listen learn that's it. Yeah, the world that humility served you very well
00:28:53.52 --> 00:28:56.52 And I hope if there's anyone anyone listening that's a young
00:28:57.52 --> 00:29:01.52 Leader going into position have that attitude because that's that's the way you do it. You stay humble
00:29:01.52 --> 00:29:06.52 Going back to the book we parked outside tonight your year actually out on patrol
00:29:07.52 --> 00:29:13.52 We parked outside the only modern instruction within the fort a single story double cubed concrete building with a few undersized windows
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:20.52 A pair of exhaust vents stuck out either side of the door and a smear of black suits streamed up along them on the concrete wall
00:29:21.52 --> 00:29:27.52 This would be our home for the next few days our battalion had deployed to this part of Afghanistan for one purpose to control the border with the Pakistan
00:29:27.52 --> 00:29:35.52 The mountain caves around here were insurgents equivalent of forward operating bases Pakistan was their safety zone where they would
00:29:36.52 --> 00:29:46.52 Re-supply rearm and train between missions to Afghanistan after sneaking across the frontier that reoccupied their cave complexes and used them the springboards to launch attacks against coalition bases or units
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:50.52 They did then they'd escape across the border to start the cycle all over again
00:29:50.52 --> 00:30:01.52 Our job was to staunch the enemy flow of troops and supplies into Afghanistan and bandar was one of the key bases to support that intent
00:30:02.52 --> 00:30:17.52 From here from there coalition troops could patrol the surrounding area and establish checkpoints on the road leading into Pakistan controlling the enemy and securing the populace are aggressive keystones of any successful counter-insurgency operation
00:30:17.52 --> 00:30:19.52 By getting out there and actively patrolling
00:30:20.52 --> 00:30:25.72 We could disrupt the rat lines and force them to react to us. So that's what you were doing yep
00:30:28.52 --> 00:30:29.52 Now
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:35.34 You at this point you're meeting with like a friendly and I he's a Afghan
00:30:35.34 --> 00:30:40.02 Afghan border policemen his name was a major alarm ghoul who had been fighting
00:30:40.52 --> 00:30:44.52 I mean the guy fought the Russians in the 80s and the Afghan civil war in the 90s
00:30:44.52 --> 00:30:50.52 I mean he was like 50 years old just nothing but hardened warrior and there I am like 24-year-old
00:30:51.52 --> 00:30:53.52 I'm telling you man like I don't really know what the hell I was doing
00:30:53.52 --> 00:30:58.52 I was just shooting from the hip like no pun intended the whole time. You know just trying to like you know puff my chest out
00:30:59.52 --> 00:31:05.52 And these guys that are these experience like this border and again and obviously people at listen to spot Casano
00:31:05.52 --> 00:31:12.52 I'm reading probably 10% of this book the entire you have to get this book to get all the nuance that you put in here
00:31:12.52 --> 00:31:17.52 It's an incredible book, but you you talk about that and I kind of took some that up quickly
00:31:17.52 --> 00:31:26.52 I put in my notes. I wrote friendly Afghan border police right because these guys are these guys are kind of out to take care of themselves
00:31:26.52 --> 00:31:28.52 They go to the highest yeah, they go to the highest exactly
00:31:29.52 --> 00:31:34.52 Yep, so you're there with this guy in Afghan border police trolled by regarding us curiously
00:31:34.52 --> 00:31:38.52 So you guys in their compound. I nodded him and he returned my cautious greeting
00:31:38.52 --> 00:31:44.52 He took a few more steps then stopped and dropped his trousers right there in the open he squatted and relieved himself
00:31:45.52 --> 00:31:53.52 The men on my puttune paw to their work and took notice a few lost their composure and gamed the rest put on their game faces turned away and returned to the task at hand
00:31:54.52 --> 00:32:00.52 The border cop finishes business wiped himself with his left hand and continued on his way. It was an unexpected cultural moment
00:32:00.52 --> 00:32:08.52 So again, this is these kind of things that people in America sometimes don't recognize what's going on this is life
00:32:09.52 --> 00:32:14.52 It's true. I mean we get down to Bandar and Bandar the Bandar check point is located like a man five kilometers from the
00:32:15.52 --> 00:32:21.52 From the Pakistan border and it was in southern like maybe mid to southern Kamal province
00:32:22.52 --> 00:32:27.52 And these Afghan border police were like you know left out there flat and man in the Afghan border police in Afghanistan
00:32:27.52 --> 00:32:33.52 We're like the least well funded between the Afghan National Army the Afghan police the Afghan border police
00:32:34.52 --> 00:32:37.52 The Afghan border police were like the red headed stepchild of the Afghan government man
00:32:37.52 --> 00:32:43.52 They were just like left out there flat and their AKs were rusty hogs. I mean there was no patrol discipline inside that base
00:32:44.52 --> 00:32:47.52 I'm telling you man there were shit piles everywhere. It was like
00:32:48.52 --> 00:32:50.52 You know no one wants to walk through a minefield
00:32:50.52 --> 00:32:58.52 I think we all agree that's a terrible thing and Afghanistan can be a very real thing if you find if you're but this was an entirely different type of minefield that we thought like you know
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:04.52 How do you explain to how do you explain to the Afghan chief of police down there the border police like hey man
00:33:05.52 --> 00:33:08.52 You kind of clean up some of this human share around here. This is not this is not healthy
00:33:09.52 --> 00:33:14.52 But that's how they were like piles of human shit everywhere big intense volleyball game like you know the Afghan
00:33:15.52 --> 00:33:18.52 I mean it was just the craziest crazy crazy shit you ever see in your life
00:33:18.52 --> 00:33:23.52 It's crazy it's weird like when we'd go and take over a building like if we're gonna stay in a building for a few days
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:26.52 Within I'm not kidding within a half an hour
00:33:27.52 --> 00:33:35.52 Guys would be fixing stuff and like rerouting things and hey, let's get this building and you you go into some Iraqi family
00:33:35.52 --> 00:33:41.52 They've been living there for however many however many decades and they would still have like
00:33:41.52 --> 00:33:49.52 You know in their kitchen there'd be a little hole next to the wall where they would take a shit and then they would kind of push it out through the hole in the wall
00:33:50.52 --> 00:33:57.52 And that's just that's just how it was and I always thought to myself Americans are kind of crazy in the other direction
00:33:58.52 --> 00:34:02.52 We look at something and go, oh, you know what this is I'm just gonna fix this. I'm wait. Why would I shit in my own kitchen?
00:34:03.52 --> 00:34:07.52 No, this isn't making sense. Okay, this is what we're gonna do we're gonna get some kind of a contraption that's gonna carry this stuff outside
00:34:07.52 --> 00:34:14.52 You know you figure it out Americans will walk if you ever watch five minutes of HGTV if there's some weird master bath right next to your kitchen sink
00:34:15.52 --> 00:34:22.52 It's often times a deal break people won't even buy the house. Yes, maybe Americans will say hello that I'm not even I'm not even buying this let alone fix it
00:34:23.52 --> 00:34:32.52 But you're so right man like those I feel like they've disbanded doing business. You know get no pun intended for thousands of years man and like that's just how it is
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:39.52 It's as how it is and you know that's what what's now what's truly crazy about that in terms of like a leadership challenge
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:46.52 Like it's not only are you leading your troops, but you've got to establish a good cultural relationship with the people that you're you're operating amongst because otherwise
00:34:47.52 --> 00:34:55.52 You're not gonna have any success in finding and targeting the enemy. How do you talk about that without offending that you know you go into these meetings and you lead with that
00:34:55.52 --> 00:35:02.52 You know what I mean and then and then he's cooking for you like scoop it into this pot of dogs and chicken. There's like you know it's like
00:35:03.52 --> 00:35:08.52 Thank God for Sipra man, you know what I mean like you did you have to dive right in
00:35:09.52 --> 00:35:20.52 Otherwise you're offended the local populist and I mean the consequences could be very real man to get your ass shot off by these guys that you know like I say they play both sides of the ball crazy
00:35:20.52 --> 00:35:24.52 Moving on you do a terrific job of
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:35.52 In my notes, I just have written the platoon in quotes right because you do what everyone has to do which is describe these guys that you're with and
00:35:36.52 --> 00:35:43.52 It's you know that's enough referring to James Web again who wrote this book called Field to Fire and if you haven't read it
00:35:43.52 --> 00:35:49.52 You should read it's a novel, but it's based on his time in Vietnam and when you know his story then you realize it actually was his time in Vietnam almost exactly
00:35:50.52 --> 00:35:55.52 But he wrote that book before any of these other Vietnam war books came out and in that book he
00:35:56.52 --> 00:36:02.52 He talks about you know he describes the platoon and it's all the stereotypical characters better in a platoon and
00:36:03.52 --> 00:36:07.52 What's what's amazing about it is like they those were the real guys that weren't his platoon those the characters
00:36:07.52 --> 00:36:14.52 You describe those the characters that are never every major Vietnam movie that there is from platoon to a populist now
00:36:14.52 --> 00:36:24.52 Like they all have this to full metal Jack they all have the same stereotypical American cross cut right the city slicker the the country kid, you know
00:36:25.52 --> 00:36:31.52 Like the the Chubby dumb kid that doesn't like they got all the stereotypes and you know as I'm reading your stuff
00:36:32.52 --> 00:36:35.52 Guess what there it is again, and you did a great job of putting these guys out going back to the book
00:36:35.52 --> 00:36:40.52 Staff Sergeant and I can't cover all of them and you didn't even have the opportunity to cover all the guys that you had
00:36:40.52 --> 00:36:48.52 But you hit some of the highlights on the hit some of the highlights staff Sergeant Phil bald with my second squad leader approached six foot four and built like a full back bald
00:36:48.52 --> 00:36:54.52 When caught an imposing figure in the growing darkness at 34 he was the second oldest member of our platoon
00:36:54.52 --> 00:37:01.52 He had joined the army in 2001 after watching the Twin Towers fall on 9-11 on TV in his house in small town, Illinois
00:37:01.52 --> 00:37:08.52 Other squad leaders staff sergeants Campbell sabaki as I'm gonna say that yes sabaki and wait
00:37:08.52 --> 00:37:13.52 Sabaki was a human tempest who blew through life fueled by a raging inner passion
00:37:14.52 --> 00:37:22.52 While serving in a mechanized unit he'd had sabot tattooed and a half circle above his belly button, which is which is anti arm around
00:37:23.52 --> 00:37:25.52 Wates was a leadership challenge
00:37:25.52 --> 00:37:32.52 He talked about your platoon sniper, blue eyed blonde herds sergeant wheat
00:37:32.52 --> 00:37:42.52 You know you got the cast of characters and it is it's legitimately like their tight casted from from from saving private rye and from band of brothers from the Pacific
00:37:42.52 --> 00:37:44.52 Like that's America.
00:37:44.52 --> 00:37:53.52 Yeah, I've looked and so I feel like when I waited into my platoon it was you know the most diverse cross section of people that you can possibly imagine
00:37:53.52 --> 00:38:03.52 You know I mean rich serving next to poor northern or serving next to southern or like you know black white Asian Hispanic Muslim Christian atheist Sabot was a Satanist
00:38:03.52 --> 00:38:11.52 I mean all in the same fox woman and it's like you know what I mean like in America like I feel like we're divided amongst those lines
00:38:11.52 --> 00:38:19.52 But in an infantry battalion and in a combat unit you address it directly and in a way you transcend those stupid petty differences
00:38:19.52 --> 00:38:30.52 And this is like why I always say like real leaders unite they don't they don't they don't devise you know and my you know my NCOs and my platoon were truly amazing
00:38:30.52 --> 00:38:39.52 I mean these guys came from every different walk of life their boots and t-shirts had more experience in the military than I did and they had every reason in the world
00:38:39.52 --> 00:38:45.52 Right to stick me in a corner office in my platoon CP and be like just do the paperwork sir
00:38:45.52 --> 00:38:54.52 We got this but they didn't you know they took me under the wing they taught coached and mentoring me every step of the way these are people that had like I said tons of experience in military
00:38:54.52 --> 00:39:02.52 Far more than I did they most of them had chips on their shoulders as it as it came to officers, you know, but they were amazing man
00:39:02.52 --> 00:39:09.12 I mean six of my guys in my platoon six of them weren't even citizens. I had a guy from Russia. I had a guy from Haiti
00:39:09.12 --> 00:39:21.12 I had a guy from South Korea. I had a guy from South Vietnam. I had a guy from Mexico. I mean I'm not joking all these guys weren't even US citizens when they were in my platoon, you know and again
00:39:21.12 --> 00:39:28.72 You know I'm like a city guy like through through like I'm not like you want to talk about a serotypic. I'm not like I feel like I'm not like you
00:39:28.72 --> 00:39:33.72 I feel like you were the kind of like kick ass take names leader. I was the guy in my unit that always needed a haircut
00:39:33.72 --> 00:39:39.76 You know like I didn't I was not like I'm like the least tough person in the summer on like so
00:39:39.76 --> 00:39:45.08 It's supposed to be a charge of the humor like the stereotypical junior officer covered in from college does know anything
00:39:45.08 --> 00:39:48.84 City's less but I mean it is except for that
00:39:48.84 --> 00:39:56.08 I really really really want to do right by these guys and I'm telling you your humility from my perspective
00:39:56.08 --> 00:40:02.04 On the outside looking because I trained a lot of junior officers and the junior officers that were humble like you were that were like
00:40:02.04 --> 00:40:06.44 Okay, I this guy knows more than me my start those guys always do well
00:40:06.84 --> 00:40:11.28 Well most of the time they do well not always but a large percentage of those guys do well
00:40:11.28 --> 00:40:14.88 The guys that do better guys like look I went to college look I've been a range of school
00:40:14.88 --> 00:40:18.12 I know this that's a mistake and that's the guys that get their horrible
00:40:18.12 --> 00:40:23.000 Well, so look I mean I walk into my unit my very how could you not be humble first of all?
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.16 Like I said I mean these guys had far more experience with you know that in and of itself was intimidating
00:40:27.16 --> 00:40:33.000 But I walk into my unit my unit is going to the joint right in his trading center JRTC at Fort Polk in prep for this deployment
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.10 I I had a choice my commanders like I just stay here get your bear. I'm like no
00:40:37.10 --> 00:40:41.30 I'm going with my guys. I'm going to train with my men before we go to come so I don't even have a place
00:40:41.30 --> 00:40:47.14 I put my stuff in storage and I'm at Fort Drum which is like there are two seasons there like July and winter right and like
00:40:47.64 --> 00:40:52.08 You know, I know it's so the issue you go to see I have and they issue you three
00:40:52.08 --> 00:40:58.18 Shopping carts full of equipment that I don't even know it's Molly gear we didn't have Molly gear like when I was in train
00:40:58.18 --> 00:41:03.70 So I had no idea how to how to use it and I get to my unit and like my NCS like dump these three shopping carts
00:41:03.70 --> 00:41:07.70 And all my gears mixed up and that pile that just tall as me and I'm like so guys
00:41:07.70 --> 00:41:13.02 I'm just like so I'm I'm going on this deployment with you my NCS are like God damn it
00:41:13.74 --> 00:41:17.96 They all start putting together my gear forming and I'm just like standing in the middle of them
00:41:17.96 --> 00:41:19.96 twiddling my thumbs thinking like this is
00:41:19.96 --> 00:41:23.52 Not the best way to earn the respect of your church
00:41:23.52 --> 00:41:30.06 Yeah, you know what's awesome from a leadership perspective as well is and your book shows it very clearly as this relationship
00:41:30.24 --> 00:41:36.32 Develops between you and the NCOs the NCOs NCOs that have the attitude of my officer
00:41:36.32 --> 00:41:39.98 Doesn't know anything and screw him and I want to keep him over in the corner doing paperwork
00:41:40.26 --> 00:41:45.24 Those guys end up with officers that suck yes, and they don't have a good working relationship
00:41:45.24 --> 00:41:48.40 It's a self-licking ice gets a self- it's a self-perpetuating thing
00:41:48.40 --> 00:41:53.000 Like it's a loser. It's what it is. They've had a bad experience with an officer at a young net
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.76 And then they said they just said screw officers and then because if said screw officers every officer they get they don't help
00:41:58.76 --> 00:42:00.76 And then those guys never become good
00:42:00.76 --> 00:42:07.92 Yes, exactly and that is not as functional as a cartoon where the NCOs do what they're supposed to do
00:42:07.92 --> 00:42:15.28 Which is help the junior officer learn their job and advise them and it's literally what their job is in the in the in the Navy
00:42:15.28 --> 00:42:18.62 We call the senior Edlisted advisor. That's what you have yeah
00:42:18.62 --> 00:42:23.46 Your Paltoon Chief is your senior in listed advisor that's supposed to advise you on what the hell will do
00:42:23.46 --> 00:42:29.16 So when guys neglect that or their anti officer they end up with a crappy Paltoon
00:42:29.16 --> 00:42:34.96 Yeah, and you know the the guys that the guys that neglect that end up with a crappy Paltoon
00:42:35.60 --> 00:42:41.86 Or you know the guys that you know you get to Afghanistan or you get to Iraq combat can be you know a
00:42:41.86 --> 00:42:47.18 Great sifter of people right so the guys that maybe were that in your Paltoon that you couldn't quite like
00:42:47.46 --> 00:42:52.26 Move out of your Paltoon prior to the deployment or maybe you knew that they were leadership challenge along the way
00:42:53.38 --> 00:42:55.14 combat has a wave of
00:42:55.14 --> 00:42:57.62 Sifting through those types of people as well. Yeah, yeah
00:42:58.74 --> 00:43:05.62 It does indeed all right continuing on the men seem to be in good spirits at the Northeast corner of the perimeter
00:43:05.62 --> 00:43:06.82 I found
00:43:06.82 --> 00:43:08.82 Sergeant Michael Emerick in the truck
00:43:08.82 --> 00:43:12.82 In the truck commander's seat of the Humvee hunched over sketch baddardies
00:43:13.54 --> 00:43:18.12 Illuminated with his headlamp. We greeted each other. I leaned on the door to peer over to shoulders latest creation
00:43:18.12 --> 00:43:21.20 Emmerick was an outstanding NCO and team leader who
00:43:21.70 --> 00:43:23.70 Who's men loved him?
00:43:23.70 --> 00:43:30.52 He was also gifted artist. I'd read a skill I'd recently tapped by asking him to create an emblem for our platoon
00:43:31.86 --> 00:43:36.26 When we had a break in patrolling we were going to paint it on each of our vehicles which were working on Emmerick
00:43:36.26 --> 00:43:41.24 I asked he showed me the sketch pad Jesus man. That's outstanding. I said looking at his creation
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:44.84 He drawn a fierce and toothy skull bursting from the O of
00:43:45.46 --> 00:43:47.06 Outlaws
00:43:47.06 --> 00:43:54.52 Isn't finished yet sir Emmerick said a little self-consciously Emmerick. This is perfect. We'll put it on every truck that way the enemy will always know who they're dealing with
00:43:54.98 --> 00:43:55.98 Thank you sir
00:43:55.98 --> 00:43:57.22 Like we
00:43:57.22 --> 00:43:59.22 Emmerick hailed from Louisiana
00:43:59.22 --> 00:44:04.66 Though he didn't have weets deep accent. No man. Thank you. That image is gonna give us our identity
00:44:04.66 --> 00:44:09.84 When I first taken over the platoon I wanted us to have our own unique persona
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:15.50 We settled on calling ourselves the Outlaws and I'd paid out of pocket to have t-shirts made for everyone
00:44:15.66 --> 00:44:21.90 We also came up with our own guide on we were the only platoon with one the they're officially for company level above
00:44:21.90 --> 00:44:26.38 By the time we got out here we were known as the Outlaw platoon throughout the brigade now
00:44:26.38 --> 00:44:29.16 Thanks to Emmerick's design the enemy would know us as well
00:44:30.46 --> 00:44:32.96 Boom what made you decide to do that?
00:44:32.96 --> 00:44:35.58 You know we well in training
00:44:36.42 --> 00:44:40.90 You know one of the things that one of my NCOs said to me was that hey sir
00:44:41.40 --> 00:44:42.68 You know
00:44:42.68 --> 00:44:49.48 You know when we're we're here training we have we have a tremendous opportunity to take this group of individuals and make them into a team
00:44:49.48 --> 00:44:53.98 And I got to tell you sir, you know once that first bullet cracks by your head
00:44:54.30 --> 00:44:56.64 You know the individual does not matter anymore
00:44:56.64 --> 00:45:03.000 The only thing that matters is is this team and more only as fast as our slowest person and
00:45:03.82 --> 00:45:08.000 So at that moment I said all right, so what do we do you know?
00:45:08.50 --> 00:45:17.34 How can we how can we how can we sort of transcend the traditional training relationships or professional relationship that we have right spring and all my squad leaders
00:45:18.02 --> 00:45:23.68 We started throwing around names for the platoon and we settled on the Outlaws because that's sort of
00:45:23.68 --> 00:45:28.06 That embodied the persona of my pretend we were sort of the black sheep of the batain and training
00:45:28.46 --> 00:45:31.60 I feel like everything we did was wrong. I mean we get re-cocked on our
00:45:32.32 --> 00:45:37.44 Life fire lanes like every time in 2030 20 30 times like that mean I was the black sheep of the lieutenant
00:45:37.44 --> 00:45:40.96 I got it didn't go to any infantry training like hey, keep an eye on this guy
00:45:40.96 --> 00:45:44.40 So we're like we're the outlaws, you know screw it like that's who we're gonna be
00:45:45.40 --> 00:45:48.24 And you know I'm telling you my men
00:45:48.24 --> 00:45:53.000 They took that they embraced it man like they had these t-shirts and hoodies they rocked them everywhere
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.64 They rocked everywhere like platoon's aren't supposed to have guidance and companies in fact
00:45:56.64 --> 00:46:00.68 I remember running with my platoon. They're all carrying this guy out of my batain commander runs by and he's like
00:46:01.08 --> 00:46:05.58 What are these idiots doing hey, you know, you're not supposed to have a platoon got it didn't matter
00:46:05.58 --> 00:46:09.26 Like carry it everywhere and and when we got to Afghanistan that
00:46:09.46 --> 00:46:14.28 You know, I'll just sit and brought me on board with branding in a big way, you know, they these guys
00:46:14.28 --> 00:46:21.88 That that became their collective identity, you know, and that's the thing about the military that is truly remarkable right like they
00:46:22.36 --> 00:46:28.18 They teach you to shoot movement communicate together and then you go to combat and you fight bleeding
00:46:28.18 --> 00:46:32.20 Died together, you know, and that's one of the things I always talk about about going home is like when you come home
00:46:32.20 --> 00:46:34.44 It's like okay now everyone goes there separate ways
00:46:34.44 --> 00:46:40.20 It's like runs completely contrary to how you're trained, which is I think part of the reason why men struggle men and women struggle so much
00:46:40.20 --> 00:46:41.20 but
00:46:41.20 --> 00:46:44.08 Yeah, we emric designed this
00:46:45.04 --> 00:46:52.64 Outwaltune logo and then they started my men just started designing stencils of it and put it on the ballistic turrets of their trucks and their doors and it's like
00:46:52.88 --> 00:46:57.10 Pain it on their four-lept or flicks or whatever and I don't know what you guys call it
00:46:57.10 --> 00:47:00.80 But flicks as I've we called it it just became who we were and
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:04.12 You know we got in a few fights and we started to
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.96 Did you know we started to have this reputation in our area of operations of like
00:47:10.96 --> 00:47:16.000 The green skulls and it got to be weird listen to the the enemies communications on their little icons and they be like
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.32 Oh, it's the green skulls like wait for another unit where like
00:47:18.72 --> 00:47:24.04 That's what I'm talking about yeah, yeah, yeah, it was it was it was it was I mean
00:47:24.04 --> 00:47:28.40 I can't like I can't even overstit I can't even believe that I lived this life. Oh, you know
00:47:28.40 --> 00:47:31.28 I look back at it. I'm like it seems surreal because it's not
00:47:32.48 --> 00:47:34.88 You know what I'm not I'm not the
00:47:35.48 --> 00:47:39.36 You know I feel like every veteran today has to be like a big MMA guy
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:41.84 Like a huge rifles and you know
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:46.54 I saw something on your make-out inside not that's I love it my man to say like you know
00:47:46.54 --> 00:47:49.98 You're last Instagram me some video view poem back this big bone like God damn
00:47:49.98 --> 00:47:54.54 I got to go on a podcast of this guy like I was just playing Pokemon with my son
00:47:54.54 --> 00:47:58.16 I'm not this is not who I am you know this guy's gonna kill me
00:48:00.36 --> 00:48:04.44 No, that's awesome, but so yeah, I mean I ripped off
00:48:04.44 --> 00:48:13.08 Colonel David Hackworth and the book about face re-heary names his his battalion the hardcore right and that's why when I took over
00:48:13.64 --> 00:48:18.86 Tasking to Bravo at seal team three I changed tasking to bruiser same thing like this is what we're gonna be
00:48:18.86 --> 00:48:22.68 Yes, normal and it's like the person did it become like oh yes personality
00:48:22.68 --> 00:48:24.66 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
00:48:24.66 --> 00:48:29.40 There's a lot. Yeah, I mean it's a little like I go out work with companies
00:48:29.40 --> 00:48:36.32 I'll go out work with companies I met this guy. He's like we named our like construction shift shifts
00:48:36.32 --> 00:48:41.66 So every shift has their own name and then they're like trying to how compete each other on who can get more love
00:48:41.66 --> 00:48:46.40 That stuff right well, I mean, I mean look we had a battalion football game like all we were the outlaws
00:48:46.40 --> 00:48:52.10 They were they had their own little uniforms man. I mean they they rolled into that football game with some serious attitude man
00:48:52.10 --> 00:48:57.90 We ended up winning I mean it's just you know it is powerful. I mean it helps galvanize people under a common banner
00:48:57.90 --> 00:48:59.90 I think that if you're a leader
00:48:59.90 --> 00:49:01.90 You know obviously humble
00:49:01.90 --> 00:49:08.62 Big eyes big ears listen, but like part of your job is to galvanize people bring people together from all walks of life and a great way to do it is to come up with a
00:49:08.86 --> 00:49:12.42 Yeah, a name a unit a symbol out of about you know and so
00:49:13.02 --> 00:49:17.70 Us versus the world I didn't know what the hell I was doing at the time I just listened to my NCOs, but it seemed to work
00:49:17.70 --> 00:49:19.70 You know they were 100% right
00:49:21.90 --> 00:49:27.10 You're continuing to making the rounds talking to some of your guys in the platoon and you go up and talk to a guy that's well
00:49:27.10 --> 00:49:31.68 I guess you wouldn't say in your platoon as your turf this name is Abdul and you go up to him and
00:49:32.78 --> 00:49:36.54 You ask him why do you do this job? He didn't speak it first instead
00:49:36.78 --> 00:49:41.14 He dug his two is MRE pouch and found a package or cracker Teele as you open to me said
00:49:42.06 --> 00:49:46.72 At the beginning of the war my father worked for the Americans at fobs skin my saying there I can't
00:49:46.72 --> 00:49:51.52 Yeah, I couldn't conceal my surprise in my voice really doing what?
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:57.06 Interpreter his answer intrigued me is he still working there more silence
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:03.48 Abdul studied his exposed cracker took a bite then glance back to me. He's dead
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.28 I didn't know what to say he was killed by the Taliban four years ago
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:11.84 We received night letters. I
00:50:13.08 --> 00:50:16.08 sat down peering at Abdul intently
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:22.82 Is that why you do this he nodded every mission I go on. I avenge my father's death
00:50:22.82 --> 00:50:28.66 I'm the head of the house now. It is my duty that explained everything his courage under fire
00:50:28.94 --> 00:50:33.06 The trust cappin Kennedy had placed in him his standing with the locals
00:50:33.06 --> 00:50:38.64 I understood why he didn't cover his face. He wanted the enemy to know what he was doing
00:50:39.48 --> 00:50:41.72 How about you, Lieutenant? Why are you here?
00:50:41.72 --> 00:50:47.54 I opened a bottle of water and down half of it thinking back to the day I had found purpose in my life
00:50:48.20 --> 00:50:52.24 Unconsciously I touch the St. Christopher's metal at my throat
00:50:54.04 --> 00:50:56.04 September 11th I said simply
00:51:00.04 --> 00:51:02.04 So
00:51:02.04 --> 00:51:03.04 Abdul
00:51:03.04 --> 00:51:06.76 Yeah, a good guy. He's a great guy. And just great
00:51:06.76 --> 00:51:11.52 Explain night letters a little bit. Yeah night letters are you know if you're a
00:51:12.16 --> 00:51:15.48 If you're known in country to be working with the Americans and the bad guys know
00:51:16.32 --> 00:51:22.08 That you're working with the Americans they'll start finding out where you live and start sending letters to your family at night
00:51:22.08 --> 00:51:25.88 And Abdul's family in this regard would wake up every day
00:51:26.36 --> 00:51:28.78 Walk out to their front door and there'd be a letter stape odor
00:51:28.92 --> 00:51:32.84 You know nailed to their front door, which is basically threats like if if
00:51:32.84 --> 00:51:39.16 If Abdul continues to work with and support the Americans we're gonna kill him and kill your family and so
00:51:39.72 --> 00:51:42.12 Abdul would get word of these night letters
00:51:43.08 --> 00:51:50.12 On our base now we were at Ford operating base for Mel and so Burmel was about five clicks from the border and right south
00:51:50.12 --> 00:51:55.08 Just directly south east of us were scanned 45 minute drive south was scanning and they would
00:51:55.44 --> 00:52:01.88 Army special forces would rotate in and out of there and skin is sort of famous for being co-located with with what they call an Afghanistan
00:52:01.88 --> 00:52:08.28 The Alamo, which is a like a little bee hut where like these you know secret squirrel types would sit there with like
00:52:08.28 --> 00:52:11.24 They're a little calm stuff and listen to like what the Taliban were talking about
00:52:11.24 --> 00:52:15.28 But there is there's an outpost there and Abdul's family lived right there
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:18.28 So they lived right in the thick of it and Abdul was a guy that
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:23.40 He didn't this was back in the day before the Americans did the hiring of the interpreters like
00:52:23.64 --> 00:52:27.48 Officially like you know I think task force tight and was what they were in Afghanistan while I mean
00:52:27.48 --> 00:52:31.48 But when I was in Afghanistan it was like hey, you know you get 10,000 bucks from your talk
00:52:31.48 --> 00:52:36.12 From the tactical operations center pay the interpreters type thing first start and going out and paying that's how we hired him
00:52:36.12 --> 00:52:42.20 But Abdul was just a great find and where we were in Afghanistan specifically in Pactica province
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.60 They spoke was Erie I mean they didn't speak post you or Dari or Farcey they spoke was Erie
00:52:48.60 --> 00:52:52.84 So you would you'd get an interpreter from Kabul or something like that and they couldn't even go to the language
00:52:52.84 --> 00:52:54.84 So you had to have somebody local
00:52:54.84 --> 00:52:59.96 Abdul knew most of the bad guys that we're fighting at least the the bad guys that were local to the area
00:52:59.96 --> 00:53:05.08 And he just in a big FU to them. He's not wearing a mask. He's in the fight just like we are and
00:53:05.64 --> 00:53:11.72 You know that's that that's I realized in that moment that most Afghans are on the front lines just like Americans a lot of Afghans
00:53:12.52 --> 00:53:15.80 They want they want the same things that that we have here
00:53:15.80 --> 00:53:18.52 You know and they're willing to fight for it and Abdul was one of those people
00:53:19.48 --> 00:53:21.48 So he's getting those nightletters
00:53:22.12 --> 00:53:27.64 Eventually they they escalate to a point where he bails and he leaves camp. Yes, and
00:53:27.64 --> 00:53:34.04 This going back to the book the next morning out wall puttoon rose early to prepare for another long patrol mission
00:53:34.20 --> 00:53:39.64 This time we'd be out beyond the wire for another six days task with setting up snap checkpoints and observation posts
00:53:39.96 --> 00:53:44.52 All over our area of operation. We sorted beyond the wire heading into our area of operations
00:53:44.92 --> 00:53:46.44 5-Hum Vs strong
00:53:46.44 --> 00:53:52.12 We had gone we hadn't gone far when I got a radio call from the base operation center telling us to turn around and come home
00:53:52.28 --> 00:53:55.80 There was no explanation. We swung around and drove back through the main gate
00:53:55.80 --> 00:54:01.64 Soldiers were running in different directions and there was a charged atmosphere that had been lacking when we left
00:54:01.64 --> 00:54:05.88 We dismounted saw Bill and Baldwin linked up with me and the idea was going on sir
00:54:05.96 --> 00:54:10.92 Baldwin asked me no, let me see if I can find out turn them trucks around and make sure everyone stays close
00:54:10.92 --> 00:54:15.64 Roger sir. I walked this to the operation center when they found first Sergeant Christopher
00:54:15.64 --> 00:54:21.64 What I found first first Sergeant Christopher overseeing controlled chaos when I asked what was going on
00:54:21.64 --> 00:54:29.16 He said delta found the body of a local national so
00:54:30.92 --> 00:54:35.64 You guys go out they find a body along along a road they send you guys out to go and
00:54:36.84 --> 00:54:41.88 See what see what's going on identify the body see if you can figure anything out and here you guys
00:54:42.12 --> 00:54:44.12 You guys find the body it's next to a bike
00:54:45.72 --> 00:54:49.08 Alongside the road and here we go back to the book we drew alongside and stopped
00:54:49.96 --> 00:54:51.56 Lieutenant Marbury
00:54:51.56 --> 00:54:56.52 Had been right the cyclist had been shot in the leg it was twisted under him in an awkward position
00:54:56.52 --> 00:54:57.96 What do you think happened? I asked
00:54:58.52 --> 00:55:01.40 Waverly said nothing his eyes were devoid of emotion
00:55:02.04 --> 00:55:06.60 But I knew him to be a sensitive man inside he must have been really leaders make decisions
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.48 Based on the best information available and a thorough game boarding of possible outcomes
00:55:11.80 --> 00:55:14.52 But even the most competent leaders cannot account for everything
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:18.76 Life has a way of breeding unintended consequences if it was abdule
00:55:18.76 --> 00:55:22.68 He would shoulder the guilt of this day for the rest of his life
00:55:22.84 --> 00:55:26.20 Lieutenant Marbury looked back up the road and spoke softly
00:55:26.20 --> 00:55:29.64 I'd say he was coming back north out of skin was ambushed here
00:55:30.12 --> 00:55:34.12 Maybe we maybe he tried to drive through it, but he got hit in the leg and fell off the bike
00:55:34.84 --> 00:55:36.84 I nodded made sense so far
00:55:37.16 --> 00:55:40.60 See how his leg is broken too probably happened when he hit the ground
00:55:41.32 --> 00:55:43.56 Blood can geal around the leg wound
00:55:44.04 --> 00:55:45.80 Flies were lapping at it
00:55:45.80 --> 00:55:50.36 Marbury continued he tried to get away, but they caught him executed him
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000 See the bullet hole in the back of his head I
00:55:54.04 --> 00:55:56.84 hadn't seen it. I couldn't take my eyes off the flies
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:02.44 You have to look if it's abdule at the very least you owe in that
00:56:03.48 --> 00:56:06.68 Some of the squad leaders had called Lieutenant Taylor and me turplovers
00:56:07.56 --> 00:56:11.16 They'd been through a tour here already and they'd come away with disdain for and
00:56:11.16 --> 00:56:15.64 Distrust of almost all afghans they'd seen betrayals
00:56:16.52 --> 00:56:18.52 They'd seen that here
00:56:18.52 --> 00:56:20.92 Loyalty shifted like the desert sands as
00:56:21.56 --> 00:56:26.20 Armor from such things they built a wall between themselves and the people we were sent to protect
00:56:26.28 --> 00:56:28.28 We bent down and unstrapped his helmet
00:56:28.68 --> 00:56:34.28 When we pulled it off black red putting drizzle out of it the lifeless head flopped into the dirt
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.28 Lieutenant Marbury was right the man had been shot in the back of the head
00:56:38.28 --> 00:56:41.88 I could see the entry run surrounded by matted black hair
00:56:43.40 --> 00:56:45.40 It was abdule
00:56:48.76 --> 00:56:56.44 And then you guys actually went to his families house. Yeah, that was a that was a terrible day. I mean
00:56:57.08 --> 00:57:00.36 You know as you did you have to deliver the body yeah
00:57:01.64 --> 00:57:03.64 Yeah
00:57:03.64 --> 00:57:11.64 And abdule had you know I think I mean a brother that was probably like 10 years younger than him in younger sisters younger than that
00:57:12.28 --> 00:57:13.56 and
00:57:13.56 --> 00:57:15.80 I mean his and his mom was like the
00:57:16.76 --> 00:57:20.28 I mean that little boy was like the patriarch of the family and his mom was sort of one in the show
00:57:20.92 --> 00:57:25.80 And I remember delivering the body to her and I remember just watching from afar from far away
00:57:25.80 --> 00:57:28.12 I think Lieutenant Marbury walked up with the body
00:57:28.12 --> 00:57:33.80 With with our company commander and I remember just watching her collapse at the front of her at the front of her
00:57:34.76 --> 00:57:36.04 Colot
00:57:36.04 --> 00:57:41.08 And I remember least that the little boy ran around to this wood bow on the side and he collapsed on the side
00:57:41.08 --> 00:57:42.44 Maybe it was just a terrible
00:57:42.68 --> 00:57:44.04 It was just a terrible
00:57:44.04 --> 00:57:45.80 situation and
00:57:45.80 --> 00:57:51.24 You know I've told which complained about these nightletters all the time and he would say I really need to get back to my house to take care of my family
00:57:51.24 --> 00:57:57.40 He'd talked to me commander Sean like I need to get back there and so we'd go to our commander and and talk to him about it and say look
00:57:57.40 --> 00:58:03.56 We've got to give Abdul leave to go back and sort of take care of his family and our commander ended up he ended up shooting that down
00:58:04.60 --> 00:58:08.60 Because in order for Abdul to get down there safely down and back safely we'd have to
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.80 Diver an infantry pretending to bring him to a squad and we simply did not have the combat power to do it
00:58:13.80 --> 00:58:18.20 Yep, and Abdul will end up in the middle of the night because we denied it hopped on his little dirt bike
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.56 drove down there linked up with his family. He was ambush somewhere on the way back to our base and
00:58:23.56 --> 00:58:29.16 And like I mean it happened exactly as I described we get shot in the leg the flips off the bike
00:58:29.16 --> 00:58:34.12 Tumbles off the bike and takes a bullet right to the back of the head and was executed right there by people who wanted him dead
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.84 And they they you know that was my that was my first experience with losing somebody that you know
00:58:40.84 --> 00:58:45.48 He wasn't a member of my poutine, but he he was fighting with us. You know he's an ally and
00:58:47.16 --> 00:58:49.16 Man, I
00:58:49.16 --> 00:58:53.88 Learn I think the I think the title of that chapter was like I remember thinking like man the enemy has a long dark reach
00:58:53.88 --> 00:58:55.88 They could hit you anywhere anytime and
00:58:56.84 --> 00:59:03.24 Yeah, that's they they they they they're sophisticated. They're smart fighters. They they're they're some of the world's best light infantry
00:59:03.24 --> 00:59:07.40 They know how to they not a bait infantry battoons out of bases and bait people out of bases for that matter
00:59:07.40 --> 00:59:12.68 They did that with Abdul and they caught him in a and a near ambush on the way back and it sucked
00:59:13.16 --> 00:59:18.92 It sucked and so we were left with we lost our best interpreter which was the bridge between us and the local populace
00:59:18.92 --> 00:59:20.92 And I feel like
00:59:21.16 --> 00:59:24.20 I feel like things went downhill from there. I mean because
00:59:24.92 --> 00:59:30.04 You know you never really know what these interpreters are saying is the translation is accurate
00:59:30.04 --> 00:59:38.84 Yeah, and Abdul I mean there was one of those things like my platoon sergeant and some of my more seniors at NCOs never truly trusted any of our interpreters
00:59:39.16 --> 00:59:40.44 But
00:59:40.44 --> 00:59:44.28 Abdul was one of the good ones and when we lost him shit just went downhill
00:59:44.28 --> 00:59:50.60 You're saying the book the assassination the assassination made the war personal for all of us
00:59:51.32 --> 00:59:58.36 Suddenly Abdul's younger brother bolted through the front of the door and ran to a nearby woodbilly dropped to his knees covered his head with his arms and began to sob
00:59:58.68 --> 01:00:00.68 The moment had no end
01:00:00.92 --> 01:00:05.72 We stir our visual game faces secured but beneath them we see
01:00:08.36 --> 01:00:13.40 The grief I'd felt as I stood in the ditch next to his body had given away to a slow burning rage
01:00:13.40 --> 01:00:19.80 Rage at the enemy rage at the decision that it led to his death rage that we had been unable to help the one
01:00:19.88 --> 01:00:23.64 Afghan upon whose loyalty we could always depend left without him
01:00:23.88 --> 01:00:28.92 I feared what would happen the next time I had to interact with major ghoul or any of his ill
01:00:30.12 --> 01:00:35.08 Yeah, because you literally you put a lot of faith in those turps man he was with us everywhere man
01:00:35.08 --> 01:00:38.92 And like there were you know even the 173rd everyone that was there before us like
01:00:38.92 --> 01:00:45.40 The this is the guy that would charge into ambushes with American troops like it the war was personal for him and
01:00:46.44 --> 01:00:49.16 And in that moment it was personal for us to
01:00:53.64 --> 01:00:57.64 So you're out on patrol you're in the humvies and
01:00:59.32 --> 01:01:03.48 Here we go back to the book the hackles on my next and suddenly stood straight up
01:01:03.96 --> 01:01:07.56 My nerves jangled spell bound by a sensation unfelt before
01:01:07.56 --> 01:01:12.20 What the hell perhaps I was getting the seriously dehydrated?
01:01:12.20 --> 01:01:15.96 I opened the water bottle in my hands my lips curled around its plastic rim
01:01:16.44 --> 01:01:22.60 Just as Baldwin's home v exploded first split second a bubble of orange flame sprouted from its right side
01:01:22.76 --> 01:01:27.72 The rig lurched hard left as it shock absorbed the violent blast
01:01:28.60 --> 01:01:31.24 Another flame ball boiled underneath the humvie
01:01:31.24 --> 01:01:37.72 Guards of dirt and smoke spewed horizontally from out from between the tires and instant later the fire vanished
01:01:37.96 --> 01:01:41.16 Replace by curls of black smoke haloed by swirling dusk
01:01:41.72 --> 01:01:43.72 Macloud I said that right yes
01:01:44.12 --> 01:01:49.72 Macloud Baldwin's gunner disappeared out of the turret leaving the barrel of the of his M2 50 cow
01:01:50.04 --> 01:01:54.44 Heavy machine gun pointing skyward bald wind I dropped the water bottle
01:01:54.44 --> 01:02:01.80 Before it hit my lap a third bloom of fire sporought spawned midway between our two humvies my truck
01:02:01.80 --> 01:02:04.84 Trimbled and suddenly it sounded as if someone was making popcorn
01:02:05.72 --> 01:02:11.88 Shrapnel on the armor plate the smoke and dirt shrouded Baldwin's home v from view
01:02:12.20 --> 01:02:14.20 I heard a sharp explosion behind us
01:02:14.84 --> 01:02:21.56 Quickly followed by several more the ground quaint again the water bottle shifted fell over my thigh and spilled down my pant leg
01:02:21.56 --> 01:02:27.80 Pin halt is that right pin halt sat next to me with his glove pants tied on the humvie steering wheel
01:02:27.96 --> 01:02:32.84 Sweat trickled down the side of his head more beating on his forehead just below the rim of his helmet
01:02:33.40 --> 01:02:36.52 He looked at me his face tense but his eyes determined
01:02:37.56 --> 01:02:39.56 He was waiting for me to make a decision
01:02:40.84 --> 01:02:47.80 A head more smoke swirled around Baldwin's humvie beyond it. I could see our I could see our afghan National Army A and A cohorts
01:02:47.80 --> 01:02:54.60 Bailing out of their toy owed a high looks pick up trucks toward the top of the Noel the afghan soldiers never the pictures of discipline ran this way
01:02:54.60 --> 01:02:58.60 And that with their weapons held at the low ready a few flopped into the road
01:02:59.48 --> 01:03:04.92 Into the dirt on the either side of the vehicles all this vanished off the road sprinting as they fired randomly from the hip
01:03:06.20 --> 01:03:08.60 Between the explosions the drum beat of
01:03:09.40 --> 01:03:11.96 Machine guns rang out from both sides of us
01:03:12.92 --> 01:03:14.92 This is just
01:03:14.92 --> 01:03:22.92 Get some yes, so that was my first that is my first fire fight. This is the first time I was ever shot at and like
01:03:23.72 --> 01:03:29.64 Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to start. Well, one of the things that I thought of first in that moment was like
01:03:30.92 --> 01:03:37.20 Holy shit there is a group of people out there that once me dead
01:03:37.96 --> 01:03:43.24 They've never met me before they don't know me, you know, but they want me dead and like
01:03:43.24 --> 01:03:47.000 When there's somebody out there trying to kill you
01:03:47.64 --> 01:03:50.84 The first time you experienced that sensation
01:03:52.44 --> 01:03:55.24 It's just you've never felt it before in your life and
01:03:56.28 --> 01:03:59.16 That's what I was feeling in that moment and so just to give you sense so
01:03:59.96 --> 01:04:03.24 It was held top two four seven four right on our military map is
01:04:04.04 --> 01:04:07.72 2474 feet above the 7,000 feet that we're already at
01:04:07.72 --> 01:04:14.76 Arpaltoon was tasked with doing an observation post on the backside of that hill and so we had to pull around that hill
01:04:14.76 --> 01:04:17.08 Right to the to the eastern portion of that hill
01:04:17.32 --> 01:04:19.96 So our humbese and his big column pull around the hill
01:04:19.96 --> 01:04:24.60 We drive down into what looks like this depression almost like driving down into a gravy boat
01:04:24.60 --> 01:04:30.92 We're at the bottom of that gravy boat outside the right of my door. I'm looking down and I couldn't even open my door
01:04:31.48 --> 01:04:36.52 And step out of it right because there was a sheer water right to my right and it ran through your stuck there
01:04:36.52 --> 01:04:46.20 Yes, and onto the left was this cliff and so we get around there and there are four a and a high-luxed pick-up trucks in front of us and just all hell breaks loose from both sides
01:04:47.56 --> 01:04:50.52 The enemy that day had ambushes from both sides
01:04:50.84 --> 01:04:53.88 Vali fired RPGs at both the front and rear of my humbese
01:04:55.48 --> 01:05:00.36 Probably four or five RPGs right off the bat and opened up with crew serve weapons
01:05:00.36 --> 01:05:06.12 And I remember looking up from my humbese and to the left and to the right and there were three crew serve machine guns on either ridge top
01:05:06.12 --> 01:05:10.28 I could see their flickering other firing and they were trained. They were barking the guns which means that
01:05:10.76 --> 01:05:16.84 They had enough training to like shoot the crew servicing gun let the barrel cool next guy picks up the food
01:05:16.84 --> 01:05:18.44 I mean it just was the craziest
01:05:18.44 --> 01:05:23.16 They were good. They were good. They were good and then another you had a send an alshaped ambush and so
01:05:24.52 --> 01:05:30.04 So for me as a leader I remember looking at pinhold pinhold is looking at me. He's got these big bright blue eyes and it's like
01:05:30.20 --> 01:05:34.36 You know you're in training. It's like you they always say hey make a decision sir make a decision
01:05:34.36 --> 01:05:37.16 Make a decision though. This is like my make a decision moment and
01:05:38.28 --> 01:05:43.16 You know, there's no assault through a near ambush. There's no dismounting in the middle of that and assaulting
01:05:43.16 --> 01:05:47.88 I mean they had planned this ambush in the perfect spot knowing that I couldn't assault through it right
01:05:49.56 --> 01:05:52.84 There's no driving through it because they they used the anA as a roadblocks
01:05:52.84 --> 01:05:56.28 We couldn't push through the kilzone established fire superiority on the high ground
01:05:56.52 --> 01:05:59.000 I had I had nothing nothing
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:05.16 There was nothing in that moment that I could do or execute that was from a field manual that would have gotten us out of live and so
01:06:05.16 --> 01:06:09.000 I knew that you know I had seconds to make a decision and
01:06:09.72 --> 01:06:15.24 I knew that whatever decision it was had to be bold and had to be bold enough that my men saw it and
01:06:15.96 --> 01:06:21.48 Not only did they have to see it, but they had to move out and draw fire with me and so I got out of the truck in the middle of the kilzone and
01:06:22.04 --> 01:06:28.52 Remember I remember getting out of the truck and so like there's chaos in the truck and then there's chaos outside the truck
01:06:28.52 --> 01:06:33.88 And I get out of the truck and it's just like shit is hitting the fan all around me man
01:06:33.88 --> 01:06:37.72 And I'm like looking around I hear this big crack and turns out it's this dragon off sniper
01:06:37.72 --> 01:06:44.36 I've got some sniper that's trying to shoot at me. I'm watching these rounds impact all around my feet and my first thought was like
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:49.40 Immediately regret this decision, you know and I like looking pinhole and he's like
01:06:49.64 --> 01:06:56.28 He's like what are you doing? And I remember shutting the door and I just started hauling ass of the top of the hill because I knew I had to get the anA
01:06:56.28 --> 01:06:58.28 Into their trucks
01:06:58.28 --> 01:07:03.24 You hauled ass forward forward up the hill up your towards the front of your patrol
01:07:03.24 --> 01:07:07.48 Yep, I hear the hills remember get to the anass and I remember running past Baldwin's truck
01:07:07.48 --> 01:07:11.48 Which was smoking and on fire, but not I'll get you with an RPG. Yes, yeah
01:07:12.60 --> 01:07:15.80 And I'll tell you what like those up armor hunt these man like
01:07:16.44 --> 01:07:21.24 That they were still combat effective. They were all in that truck the RPG said was RPG seven
01:07:21.24 --> 01:07:24.28 So it wasn't like anything armor piercing, but they were all still in the fight
01:07:24.28 --> 01:07:30.12 And I remember looking in the window. I remember just banging on Baldwin's up armor at Humvee window
01:07:30.12 --> 01:07:32.44 And I just sort of gave him the infantry follow me thing
01:07:32.68 --> 01:07:37.40 There's so much smoke and there's so much shit going on. I didn't even know if you really saw and I remember
01:07:37.64 --> 01:07:41.32 Running up the hill on the way there my muscles were filled with lead I'm making it at
01:07:41.88 --> 01:07:48.28 10,000 feet there's like mile high stadium football game times two and I'm like oh my god like
01:07:48.44 --> 01:07:53.40 You know because it's a young leader you're always afraid of like making a mistaken combat and drawing the item
01:07:53.40 --> 01:07:57.56 Just failing your troops and I was I'm not worried
01:07:57.56 --> 01:08:03.000 I just I remember worrying about oh my god man that I just make the biggest mistake in my life
01:08:03.64 --> 01:08:08.68 That I just like totally make a stupid decision in combat are these guys gonna even follow me
01:08:08.68 --> 01:08:10.68 I never gave him an order over the radio
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:13.32 In fact I couldn't even use our radios because
01:08:14.20 --> 01:08:17.96 The that hilltop was obscuring our line of sight comms to our base, you know
01:08:17.96 --> 01:08:23.48 There was so much shit going down and the kilzone that my squad leaders were occupying the two net yelling back and four third
01:08:23.48 --> 01:08:26.52 I mean it was just some half way up on like Jesus Christ
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.92 I didn't give an order I'm I'm I'm I'm even gonna follow me. I'm like almost out of the fight
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.44 You know I got rounds impacting all around me and I remember turning around
01:08:34.44 --> 01:08:39.08 I see and balled when charging up the hill after me and then we charging up the hill after him and then my mortar guy
01:08:39.08 --> 01:08:44.20 With a 60 millimeter mortar in handheld like slung over his back with mortar round. I mean like my entire
01:08:44.20 --> 01:08:49.80 Poutine started following me up that hill that day and and it was one of those things it was just like
01:08:52.04 --> 01:08:53.72 You know they followed me up to the top of the hill
01:08:54.36 --> 01:08:57.72 We also cover up at the top got the A&A back in there and their trucks
01:08:58.52 --> 01:09:03.88 Had him pushed through the kilzone we got our trucks up there established fire superiority and then we just ran down into the teeth the enemy
01:09:03.88 --> 01:09:05.56 And tax them and killed those little bastards
01:09:05.96 --> 01:09:11.40 It was like a three hour fire fight, but we hunted them down and brought it and after two or three hours of patchy's came in so it helped us
01:09:11.40 --> 01:09:16.04 So so it helped us cut off their x-fill routes and by the time we got up and we're firing
01:09:17.08 --> 01:09:22.04 I mean we had crew service shingons and our weapons were rocking on the tops of our trucks, but we were able to establish
01:09:22.04 --> 01:09:27.56 Combs on their base where we had two 105 millimeter howitzers that were firing and I already had how long did it take to get the 105's up
01:09:28.04 --> 01:09:32.68 But when we were up there seconds because I already had TRP's plotted on so once you got to the top of the hill
01:09:32.68 --> 01:09:36.20 Yeah, got radio comms a minute a minute after that and by the way
01:09:36.20 --> 01:09:39.80 Yeah, it what I mean, but but our gun bunnies were amazing
01:09:39.80 --> 01:09:42.76 Our our artillery guys were incredible, but I already
01:09:43.32 --> 01:09:47.72 Coordinated with our tactical operations center on where I thought the enemy would ex-fill and I gave them hey
01:09:47.72 --> 01:09:51.72 If I say fire TRP one like this is where you're this is what you're firing
01:09:51.72 --> 01:09:57.32 Target prepel inspires yeah, it was I mean the the object of the infantry is to kick boots on the objective
01:09:57.32 --> 01:10:00.12 Right like if we're in a fight we're doing it wrong, you know, so
01:10:00.84 --> 01:10:05.08 Estilaminifiers was something that I was a big believer and we didn't really get the execute at that day
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:07.96 But you know the goal is is you know you're you know
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:10.92 You're if we if we know we're doing a movement to contact
01:10:11.48 --> 01:10:17.000 I want to make sure that my howitzers are firing every second until my men get on that objective and then we stop fire
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.64 With the guns and then we exploit with boot with boots on the ground
01:10:19.64 --> 01:10:21.80 Right and to give the enemy very little reaction time
01:10:22.28 --> 01:10:27.000 But that day we didn't have that so we improvised we improvised and then I mean remember charging
01:10:27.32 --> 01:10:29.56 Tardin directly east and I think we killed I think
01:10:30.28 --> 01:10:33.88 I mean we got attacked by like probably 30 or 40 guys that day
01:10:33.88 --> 01:10:35.72 I think that was what the report said in the aftermath
01:10:35.72 --> 01:10:37.72 I think we killed six or seven of them
01:10:37.72 --> 01:10:41.88 At least you know, I mean couldn't really find any
01:10:43.24 --> 01:10:45.24 They're so good at casivac, but
01:10:45.24 --> 01:10:51.56 We killed at least six or seven of them that day and and for me like I remember coming back to the defac and at the end of that fight
01:10:51.56 --> 01:10:56.44 I didn't even know if I still didn't know if if I had made a colossal mistake and I'm gonna walk into the defac
01:10:56.84 --> 01:11:00.92 And it was like it was like that moment in Hoosier's here see that movie that who is like the slow-clap
01:11:00.92 --> 01:11:02.36 I like walking to the defac
01:11:02.36 --> 01:11:06.76 I think my ancio's are gonna kick my ass and they just like say bo stands up first and my god
01:11:06.76 --> 01:11:10.28 Jesus, you know, he's gonna kill me. He stands up he starts clapping
01:11:10.44 --> 01:11:13.88 It was like some goddamn thing on a rudier something, you know like that guy
01:11:13.88 --> 01:11:17.48 We're gonna carry me on there. So I mean it was I swear to Christ, you know
01:11:18.04 --> 01:11:22.12 Being a father's a greatest thing in the entire world, but that moment was one of
01:11:22.68 --> 01:11:28.36 I don't think there would never be a moment in my life, but I think it professionally anyway the word that peaks that you know in my men
01:11:28.68 --> 01:11:34.60 So look there's there's earning your troops respect from shielding them from garrison bullshit and allowing them to
01:11:34.60 --> 01:11:40.20 Try and I feel like that's an officer and leaders roll like I'll hand or the I'll hand or the collective stuff you hand at the individual training
01:11:40.92 --> 01:11:42.92 You can earn your respect that way, right?
01:11:43.16 --> 01:11:49.80 But you know, none of that shit matters you get your you get one chance in combat to do it and I feel like that was my chance
01:11:50.28 --> 01:11:57.16 It didn't it didn't go perfect. Um, I mean we got shot up pretty bad, but I mean we came out of there. It was like
01:11:58.20 --> 01:12:01.96 It was most of our it was most of our first experience getting shot at for the most part, you know
01:12:01.96 --> 01:12:05.96 And and like a really serious way like that. I mean everyone has a couple pot shots fired
01:12:05.96 --> 01:12:07.96 I don't I think all my insuas have had that, but
01:12:08.60 --> 01:12:10.60 Man that was like a four hour
01:12:12.04 --> 01:12:17.40 I mean we got trapped in the kilzone of an ambush the waterway out of it nightmare. It was a nightmare. It was a nightmare and
01:12:17.96 --> 01:12:23.32 We came out of that and it was like I remember just being like ACUs were like our army combat uniforms were like just
01:12:23.40 --> 01:12:25.08 DRAWS has drenched, you know
01:12:25.32 --> 01:12:30.12 Walking in I mean the defa everyone's got their little trays and they're like high five and everybody was like you know like
01:12:30.12 --> 01:12:36.44 Imagine being an artist you training to be an artist and never painting a painting right and we've finally got to paint our painting
01:12:36.44 --> 01:12:40.28 You know we got finally got to experience combat and it was a great thing and it was pretty cool
01:12:40.28 --> 01:12:45.96 I mean it was cool for that like one time the hundreds of time after that it gets it gets uncool very quickly
01:12:45.96 --> 01:12:48.68 But it was cool that one time that victory
01:12:49.56 --> 01:12:50.84 So yeah
01:12:50.84 --> 01:12:52.84 Rudy
01:12:52.84 --> 01:12:54.36 Defak
01:12:54.36 --> 01:12:59.64 As good as it gets and I'm going back to the book here after all the stuff goes down later that night as I lay in bed
01:13:00.04 --> 01:13:04.12 Unable to sleep despite my exhaustion. I felt the flip side of that victory
01:13:07.48 --> 01:13:08.52 Braze
01:13:08.52 --> 01:13:15.000 50 thunderd a man's arm was torn from his body. I reveled in that moment the mortar machine gun
01:13:15.40 --> 01:13:20.76 The mortar machine gun nest was a channel site men blown apart leave a vile sneaking mess
01:13:20.76 --> 01:13:27.08 Ruin bowels the copper scent of blood bits and pieces nothing more defiled by firepower
01:13:27.64 --> 01:13:31.40 I'd watched Garrett score that hit and felt enraptured
01:13:32.12 --> 01:13:39.000 Victory was evident in every kill and none of my men had been hit an infantry leader could not ask for anything more
01:13:40.60 --> 01:13:44.04 But what about the man you are I am a warrior where's the human side?
01:13:44.04 --> 01:13:51.16 Ugly thoughts boiled within me unformed terrifying they swirled around in my head as if my
01:13:51.16 --> 01:13:57.96 Atmined had tumbled across some truth my subconscious could not face today. I watched a man get blown to pieces
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:05.80 I did what I had to do as a soldier to win a desperate battle. Yes, but what about a man? What about the man you wanted to be?
01:14:06.52 --> 01:14:10.84 How did you serve him today? I tried to drive the fought from my mind
01:14:10.84 --> 01:14:15.32 Can Sean the human coexist with Sean the combat leader?
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.32 Today we had felt the indescribable rush created by bloodlust survival and victory
01:14:23.32 --> 01:14:28.52 It had bonded my platoon in ways I couldn't quite grasp now as I tossed in my bed
01:14:28.52 --> 01:14:34.52 I wondered how we would ever return to our former selves after what this fight had done to us
01:14:35.80 --> 01:14:39.000 We were becoming exactly what I did not know yet
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:45.000 But just sensing the permanence of the transformation inspired more fear than anything else
01:14:45.24 --> 01:14:46.68 I had faced that day
01:14:46.68 --> 01:14:51.08 Restless I rose from bed and stepped into the block afghan night
01:14:52.20 --> 01:14:54.84 I never felt farther away from home than at that moment
01:14:57.64 --> 01:15:01.48 Coming down yeah, you know I feel like
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:06.92 I mean, God I remember like I remember this just like it was yesterday man laying in that bed
01:15:06.92 --> 01:15:12.20 I couldn't sleep I mean, I was exhilarated but I couldn't sleep and it was like one of those things it's like
01:15:13.40 --> 01:15:16.52 Like Jesus Christ like I sat I was cheering I was
01:15:17.40 --> 01:15:23.64 Loved every second of killing the enemy was the greatest feeling up until that point in time in my life. It was the greatest feeling
01:15:24.44 --> 01:15:30.36 But then I couldn't escape the fact is like what does this say about who I am and the person that I'm becoming and what does it mean?
01:15:30.36 --> 01:15:34.52 About like how are we as Americans what are we different? How are we different on the battlefield?
01:15:34.52 --> 01:15:39.40 Like the juxtaposition of two cells like warrior and civilian you know
01:15:40.52 --> 01:15:46.20 You know just straight killer or liberator and protector and like I it to me in that moment
01:15:47.56 --> 01:15:51.56 You know, I think just think the awesome responsibility of being a young leader whether you're a young
01:15:51.56 --> 01:15:53.32 NCO team leader squad leader
01:15:53.32 --> 01:15:55.32 Paltoon sergeant Paltoon they didn't matter
01:15:55.32 --> 01:16:03.56 Um every leader in combat has a moral obligation to be the moral compass of their Paltoon or their unit their small unit and that means that
01:16:04.52 --> 01:16:08.44 You've got to do everything that you can to keep those troops when they're in the shit
01:16:09.32 --> 01:16:12.44 Tethered to who they are you know not let them
01:16:13.80 --> 01:16:21.40 Reveal in the bloodlust too much because if you do that you lose who you are you lose you lose what you lose your human side and for me
01:16:21.40 --> 01:16:32.20 You know me caught man like we went through 485 days of that hell and if we didn't if we weren't constantly connected and tethered to our human side
01:16:34.20 --> 01:16:37.64 That it would have been a fate a terrible fate for every single member of that Paltoon
01:16:38.20 --> 01:16:43.08 The likes which many of those men that I served with would not have been able to escape from I feel like and
01:16:43.80 --> 01:16:47.64 Because believe me you know you're there for eight months man if you're there for eight months
01:16:47.64 --> 01:16:54.04 Uh, you get attacked so much and so often and the enemy never relance
01:16:54.92 --> 01:17:01.08 But you have to stay disciplined you have to you have to stay above it you have to you have to you have to make the hard right decision
01:17:01.48 --> 01:17:07.40 You can't just open fire and do a group of villagers even though you know they knew exactly where that idea was placed and money
01:17:07.40 --> 01:17:13.72 You know I mean you have to stay above it. You have to stay disciplined. You have to stay tethered to your human self and in that moment
01:17:13.72 --> 01:17:19.32 I had no idea what the hell I was becoming but I knew that I was changing in a way that I might not like so much
01:17:21.64 --> 01:17:27.000 And I'm glad well the good the good part about this is you actually recognize this because
01:17:27.88 --> 01:17:29.48 This is a
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:40.44 This is something that you don't always recognize right I mean you start getting angry at the enemy and the enemy what the people that you are calling the enemy that that
01:17:40.44 --> 01:17:47.24 That that definition starts can start to grow right it can start to grow to cover like you just said the villagers that knew the
01:17:47.24 --> 01:17:51.32 ID was there well they knew that well if they knew that then they're the enemy and it's really
01:17:52.20 --> 01:17:53.24 easy
01:17:53.24 --> 01:17:54.44 For that
01:17:54.44 --> 01:18:01.000 Transition to take place and for that word to start to cover a much broader definition than what it should cover by
01:18:01.64 --> 01:18:06.76 The moral law and by the the actual law absolutely absolutely and so
01:18:06.76 --> 01:18:13.40 The bottom line is is it it's our job it's our job is is an infantry and I got to believe in a seal
01:18:13.40 --> 01:18:18.20 But tune even probably in a more precise way to close with you know find fixed finish close with the story of the enemy
01:18:18.60 --> 01:18:20.60 Kill them when they're on the battlefield
01:18:21.32 --> 01:18:26.20 But when they're you know one of the things that I talked about with my men a lot right it was something that like
01:18:26.60 --> 01:18:31.16 We trained all the time by the way and we addressed this in our training the enemy would did would hone and
01:18:31.16 --> 01:18:37.96 Evolve their TTPs and so we would as well we never stopped training and so that was how we were different from the lot of the other units in Afghanistan
01:18:37.96 --> 01:18:42.68 I think can come back on the base and just chill and relax, but no you've got a train you've got a train on
01:18:42.68 --> 01:18:45.56 escalation of force and in that as part of that training
01:18:46.52 --> 01:18:48.52 Whether you're evolving your TTPs or otherwise
01:18:49.24 --> 01:18:54.04 You've got to talk to them about our responsibility on the battlefield to take care of the enemy if they're wounded
01:18:54.04 --> 01:18:57.08 You know I cannot tell you how many times I had you know
01:18:57.08 --> 01:18:58.76 I had troops that
01:18:58.76 --> 01:19:03.88 Soldiers that wanted to put a bullet in a guy that was wounded on the battlefield how I wanted to with every fiber of who I was
01:19:03.88 --> 01:19:06.04 But you got to play the long game and think like if
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:13.16 If you do take that person's life who will you be ten years from now 20 years from now? Will you regret that decision and
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:19.48 You know the charge of a leader if you're gonna be a leader of a small unit in combat when you when you're responsible for lives
01:19:19.72 --> 01:19:22.36 You've got to be planning and thinking like that and so
01:19:23.48 --> 01:19:27.16 Yeah, it'd be great to take that guy off the battlefield and put a bullet in their head, but
01:19:27.16 --> 01:19:34.76 You're not taking care of your troops if you're a liar guys to do that as far as I know because they're gonna end up in jail exactly and then you actually that's something
01:19:36.84 --> 01:19:38.84 I
01:19:39.32 --> 01:19:41.32 We we we received a
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:45.48 A brief that we're supposed to give our guys and I did give it to my guys put the the
01:19:46.36 --> 01:19:48.36 The overall broad
01:19:48.36 --> 01:19:52.28 Like meaning of the briefless take your morals on the battlefield, right?
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.40 Yes, and I actually said hey guys
01:19:55.40 --> 01:19:59.08 This is what they're telling you to do take your morals on the battlefield. I'm gonna tell you guys don't do that
01:20:00.28 --> 01:20:03.88 Don't do that what I want you to do is I actually want you to fall the law because here's the deal
01:20:04.60 --> 01:20:06.44 what you just said what I just said like
01:20:07.64 --> 01:20:09.64 morally if you
01:20:10.44 --> 01:20:12.44 Set an ID or you
01:20:12.44 --> 01:20:16.68 Fireed an RPG and you killed a bunch of my guys. I feel like morally I can kill you
01:20:16.92 --> 01:20:18.92 Yeah, and that's okay
01:20:19.32 --> 01:20:21.32 But if you don't have a weapon anymore and
01:20:21.32 --> 01:20:30.76 You're surrendering guess what legally I can't kill you and so what you actually have to do is you have to actually follow what the law is
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:32.76 you guys
01:20:32.76 --> 01:20:38.52 You know and I I know for I know the way I felt like when my guys got wounded when my guys got killed
01:20:38.52 --> 01:20:40.52 I wanted to kill everyone
01:20:40.52 --> 01:20:41.96 Everyone all the
01:20:41.96 --> 01:20:46.60 So the earth rubble the buildings and turn the whole city into just just destruction
01:20:46.60 --> 01:20:53.88 And I told my guys that and I was like but we cannot do that and we are not going to do that because that is not legal
01:20:54.36 --> 01:20:59.40 And so what we do is we do the best we can with what the legalities are with the rules of engagement are well
01:20:59.40 --> 01:21:02.04 Follow-in will stick to them and we'll take the fight to the enemy. That's what we're gonna do
01:21:02.92 --> 01:21:04.92 But as I said
01:21:04.92 --> 01:21:06.92 that line is really
01:21:07.16 --> 01:21:09.16 really
01:21:09.16 --> 01:21:14.28 It's one of those lines that if you don't pay attention to it you can look up and you'd be way past that line
01:21:14.28 --> 01:21:17.16 I have no question. I mean for me as a leader
01:21:17.16 --> 01:21:21.64 I was not willing to delegate that you know I feel like in other words
01:21:22.04 --> 01:21:27.24 I always wanted to be I was wanted to be a part of that I was wanted to have some sort of command
01:21:27.80 --> 01:21:32.04 Command supervisor authority on that aspect of you know I was always in the fight
01:21:32.04 --> 01:21:34.04 I wanted to be in the fight I wanted to be a contact with a heavy
01:21:34.04 --> 01:21:39.80 I also wanted to be involved in those types of decisions and so I think you know you mentioned something about
01:21:40.92 --> 01:21:43.08 Just talking to your guys about how you feel too
01:21:43.08 --> 01:21:48.92 So many leaders in the military don't do that and what I mean by that is they it especially in the infantry
01:21:49.08 --> 01:21:54.84 Where leaders don't share their own vulnerabilities like hey man like I feel the same way that you do like I
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:03.32 Want to go out there and kill every one of those little bastards. You know I feel the same pain that you do this hurts me just as much to see these men get wounded and killed like
01:22:04.12 --> 01:22:09.72 But we can't do that and so just being able to identify with your men on that level is it not only does it bring you closer to them
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:16.68 I think it ingratiate them to you as a leader as well where they think like okay, you know my leader's not some abstract person out there
01:22:16.68 --> 01:22:19.96 He feels the same pain that we do he's in this with us and
01:22:20.60 --> 01:22:26.36 You know it goes back to sort of the established and that collected by identity like if you're a part of that collective identity as a leader
01:22:26.36 --> 01:22:28.36 I feel like those sorts of commands
01:22:29.64 --> 01:22:35.24 Are more likely to be to be followed in that line that you walk while it is a certainly a fine one
01:22:35.24 --> 01:22:41.56 Your best chance of staying on the right side of that is operating like that. No, yeah, if you're not connected to your guys
01:22:43.56 --> 01:22:46.76 So and and then and I know you know this
01:22:47.32 --> 01:22:52.36 You can go too far with that and all of a sudden you become one of the guys that you can't differentiate yourself
01:22:52.36 --> 01:22:56.92 And you've gone too far and you've crossed that line of your race friends and you're the friend and now
01:22:56.92 --> 01:23:01.28 Well, so when you say hey this is what we're gonna do you're not telling them that them that from a leader
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:03.88 You're telling that that your opinion from another guy
01:23:03.88 --> 01:23:08.44 Yeah, exactly necessarily after listening to you because you're just you know I think different from you
01:23:08.44 --> 01:23:11.08 Okay, I'm gonna do what I think and then it becomes hey, hey, you know
01:23:11.08 --> 01:23:13.64 I need you to take that machine gunness and I need you to take it now
01:23:13.64 --> 01:23:16.84 Is at the top of that hell see I'm pointing to a go and then you have a squad
01:23:16.84 --> 01:23:19.72 Oh, wait, you're not you're sending me you're not sending your buddy
01:23:20.28 --> 01:23:26.52 And then you're like you're in crisis as a leader and to meet your combat in effect of the moment that that question is asked if if you're
01:23:26.68 --> 01:23:30.12 The moment if that question is asked you need to be really to command you know
01:23:30.12 --> 01:23:36.04 Um, yeah, leaders yeah, don't mistake like leadership with friendship that they're not synonymous at all
01:23:36.04 --> 01:23:40.04 You know you might be able to be a friend of your guys after the fact like when retired
01:23:40.04 --> 01:23:43.96 Sit around a table smoking stoke is drinking beer, but not while you're in combat
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:45.16 It's just yeah
01:23:45.16 --> 01:23:49.64 That's why they say leadership is a lonely thing you know and and and like that and I
01:23:49.64 --> 01:23:51.16 Because I get this question all the time
01:23:51.16 --> 01:23:56.68 I had guys that work for me that were absolutely my friends 100% that I
01:23:56.68 --> 01:24:01.72 Did everything with what surf in a drink beer and did you get to and hang out 100%
01:24:03.40 --> 01:24:08.52 And those guys when I when when I said hey this is what we're doing it was like Roger
01:24:08.84 --> 01:24:15.32 No no question the thing is you don't know who's gonna have the professionalism in your poll tune to actually be able to do that with
01:24:15.48 --> 01:24:19.80 And that's why you have to take that relationship building very very slowly and
01:24:20.68 --> 01:24:22.84 If you just decide you're gonna be friends with everyone
01:24:22.84 --> 01:24:27.000 There's gonna be some guys that are gonna take advantage of the knock and be able to handle it's gonna be cause major problems and
01:24:27.80 --> 01:24:29.80 That means you can't be friends with anybody and
01:24:30.44 --> 01:24:34.88 Now you've created this distance and you'll you won't have the connection that you want so it's man
01:24:34.88 --> 01:24:38.52 This is why leadership is hard. Yeah, you know you you raise a great point. I mean I
01:24:38.84 --> 01:24:41.32 You know, I was close with my guys. I love my guys
01:24:41.32 --> 01:24:45.48 They were like my brothers in fact. I got two younger brothers and I love them too, but you know
01:24:46.20 --> 01:24:51.72 I can I can tell you who each one of my men is in the dark as they're walking away from a hundred meters away
01:24:51.72 --> 01:24:56.20 Just by how they just by their gate, you know, I feel so close with them. I had that bond with them
01:24:56.20 --> 01:25:01.24 And I feel like you know so much of leadership is just like showing up, you know showing that you care like
01:25:01.24 --> 01:25:04.68 Trooping the line and combat or walking through the barracks at night or just you know
01:25:05.08 --> 01:25:07.88 Being there with them in those little moments where you're not maybe
01:25:08.04 --> 01:25:11.80 Intimately involved pound and beers with them in the barracks, but you're like they see you they know you're there
01:25:12.76 --> 01:25:17.000 There is a there there is a way in which you can have a healthy strong
01:25:17.72 --> 01:25:20.04 I mean, I mean probably in the sealed teams
01:25:20.04 --> 01:25:25.64 It's you know to small your smaller unit and plus the guys that make you know go through sealed training and make it through sealed training
01:25:25.64 --> 01:25:28.68 Probably a little bit older than that young 18-year-old private's right you know
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:32.92 I always had guys in my I would always have one or two guys that work for me that were like
01:25:34.12 --> 01:25:41.40 That were three four echelons blooming right that were E five's yeah and they were like fully trusted right
01:25:41.40 --> 01:25:45.40 Like I go into a him and what's going on with this guy over here and they say here's what's happening and
01:25:45.88 --> 01:25:49.88 They would never take advantage of but what I'm saying is you can build those relationships
01:25:49.88 --> 01:25:53.32 But you have to be very cautious when you do it because
01:25:54.04 --> 01:25:59.000 Like you said the minute the moment that that relationships
01:25:59.88 --> 01:26:07.32 That relationship that you have with one person negatively impacts the platoon you are a disaster and in combat that has a
01:26:07.32 --> 01:26:12.36 That split seconds hesitation or question could be death. Yeah, you know and you can't have it, you know
01:26:12.36 --> 01:26:19.32 Um, but yeah, I mean I it's it's interesting that you talk about the the dichotomy between
01:26:19.32 --> 01:26:23.88 Friendship and leadership right I mean I feel like my I'm so I love my guy
01:26:23.88 --> 01:26:27.96 So this day even pinhole he was knee four I was I was I was I was the first lieutenant at that time
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:30.52 I mean he was my RTO he's my right hand man
01:26:30.52 --> 01:26:34.12 We talked about everything together from movies to TV shows or whatever
01:26:34.12 --> 01:26:35.88 I mean we had a great relationship together
01:26:35.88 --> 01:26:41.56 But he knew that when I said jump you better damn I'll jump you know and there's a lot of that is also making unpopular
01:26:41.56 --> 01:26:44.76 Assessant he's like hey sir, I don't want to be the RTO I'm like hey penal guys. Well, I don't give you shit
01:26:44.76 --> 01:26:51.32 What you think you're the you're my guy and like and pinhole to great example that because pinhole was a guy who was mature for his age
01:26:51.32 --> 01:26:56.28 He was smart and he got in you know and there's other guys that you couldn't form that kind of relationship
01:26:56.28 --> 01:27:01.88 But because they would immediately try and utilize that for their own benefit or what about it so that's
01:27:02.84 --> 01:27:04.92 That's what I'm saying I guess I just I just I just
01:27:05.32 --> 01:27:10.20 Because sometimes I think when leaders here while you can't be friends with anybody they think oh I got to be totally aloof and no one's gonna know me
01:27:10.20 --> 01:27:16.76 It's like no, no, no, no, you know what you're exactly right about that you know because there are you you're exactly right some
01:27:17.64 --> 01:27:23.96 Some officers or you know leaders and CEOs officers they do interpret it as that and then they're not involved at all
01:27:24.12 --> 01:27:27.96 You know horrible and it is terrible and there are gonna be guys that if you
01:27:28.68 --> 01:27:30.76 Bym a beard they're gonna think you're best friends
01:27:30.76 --> 01:27:32.96 They're gonna think they're gonna get preferential treatment on the
01:27:32.96 --> 01:27:37.32 You text and you hey sir, what do you up to what you want to go out to the button? No, I'm like yeah exactly
01:27:37.32 --> 01:27:39.96 It is a fine. It's a really good one
01:27:40.52 --> 01:27:42.52 It is for sure
01:27:43.16 --> 01:27:44.84 All right
01:27:44.84 --> 01:27:52.92 Going back to the book you guys had done that pretty I will call it a victory for lack of a better word second-putune had had a
01:27:55.48 --> 01:27:59.16 Probably the opposite into the spectrum here we go back to the book second-putune taken a beating
01:27:59.72 --> 01:28:04.36 We we had two on May 7th but they returned to the fob was totally different from ours
01:28:04.36 --> 01:28:10.68 Why it was all perception defeat comes in many forms most physically and psychologically second-putune had arrived
01:28:11.24 --> 01:28:13.24 Home a defeated force
01:28:13.24 --> 01:28:19.96 Though we hadn't destroyed the entire enemy force on May 7th and our counter attack had hit thin air as goolings men
01:28:20.28 --> 01:28:23.96 Broke contact with us. We'd still inflicted a lot of damage on them
01:28:24.36 --> 01:28:26.76 More important we stayed in the fight that
01:28:26.76 --> 01:28:35.48 Had given us a vital moral victory that second-putune hadn't experienced breaking contact on May 17th had been the right call
01:28:35.48 --> 01:28:39.66 Given the tactical circumstances, but its psychological effect it had on
01:28:40.36 --> 01:28:44.76 Burley's men was all too obvious their morale and confidence had taken
01:28:45.32 --> 01:28:49.88 Significant hits I could not let this happen to my guys ever
01:28:49.88 --> 01:28:58.04 How yeah, that's exactly right. I mean stay in the fight Dn that was the lesson there for me like I saw how some of some of
01:28:58.28 --> 01:29:04.60 And again right tactical systems sometimes you got a break contact right I mean, but no not for us in that moment like we made
01:29:05.32 --> 01:29:10.28 Every single one of my non-commission officers and I looked at each other after you know after we got back from that first firefight
01:29:10.60 --> 01:29:13.56 And we said to ourselves you know we saw how second-putune came back
01:29:13.80 --> 01:29:15.80 We saw how their men were ejected
01:29:15.80 --> 01:29:22.28 We saw that there are several different components to defeat but certainly physical and psychological or two-mate psychological
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:28.16 The defeat is oftentimes worse right and we just said do each other like I don't give a shit what happens like
01:29:28.16 --> 01:29:31.40 I don't give a shit with the enemy throws at us. I don't care how they attack us
01:29:31.80 --> 01:29:37.48 We're gonna stand in fight. We're always gonna stay in the fight and we are not gonna be the first to leave the battlefield
01:29:37.48 --> 01:29:40.12 What's the bottom line like if the enemy's gonna attack us?
01:29:40.12 --> 01:29:44.76 We're gonna counter attack them until they are dead until they break contact from us and that's what we did
01:29:44.76 --> 01:29:46.76 And that's
01:29:47.88 --> 01:29:50.20 That's what we did sometimes it worked great
01:29:50.92 --> 01:29:52.92 Sometimes it didn't
01:29:52.92 --> 01:29:58.04 But we we held true to that promise. That's one of those attitudes that you know I call that attitude being
01:29:58.68 --> 01:30:05.24 Default aggressive like our default mode is we're gonna attack you that's the way it's gonna be and if you have that
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:12.28 The amount of power that that gives to a to a team is like look if we get pushed
01:30:12.28 --> 01:30:17.40 We're gonna attack that's what we're gonna do if that's what everyone's thinking it gives you like a super power
01:30:17.88 --> 01:30:23.24 Because that's just a unified attitude that we're gonna go attack you absolutely and then and here's the thing
01:30:23.24 --> 01:30:30.44 It's empowering and you said it was empowering because it it empowers your soldiers or your troops to react on a
01:30:30.44 --> 01:30:34.20 Seconds notice there can be no hesitation when you're attacked if your if your position is
01:30:34.68 --> 01:30:39.40 Default aggression or in our case in outlook with him is like we're staying in the fight we're in the fight until the very end
01:30:39.40 --> 01:30:48.84 And your default is to attack all the time your men know exactly what they're supposed to do the moment that they get shot at the moment that you're attacked and it is to attack and
01:30:48.84 --> 01:30:54.84 One thing that is infinitely easier is to is to call guys and real them in like say okay guys
01:30:54.84 --> 01:30:58.20 Are guess what you know what we're not going like when you make the decision we're gonna break contact instead
01:30:58.76 --> 01:31:00.44 Okay, that's something that
01:31:00.44 --> 01:31:07.000 Where is if people don't know what they're gonna do and then you're telling them okay now we're going to attack you're trying to force that that's so very
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.96 That's my totally more challenging than having to say okay guys look you put a lot of pressure on that's cool
01:31:11.96 --> 01:31:17.24 But I don't know what's over there and we're gonna break contact guys go. Okay. Well, I'm kind of bummed out because we were we were feeling good
01:31:17.24 --> 01:31:23.96 But okay, we'll break contact that is I didn't say this in the book, but I remember having this conversation as part of this conversation was
01:31:24.44 --> 01:31:32.52 We're sitting there talking to our leadership in the pertinent you've got E five leaders who are team leaders like they got like three to five people under their command and squad leaders who are nine to 12
01:31:33.08 --> 01:31:35.80 And I remember telling my my team leaders
01:31:35.80 --> 01:31:37.80 With my platoon sergeant
01:31:38.04 --> 01:31:43.72 You all need to be team leaders of people are on the front lines like when they get shot at they're the ones that are reacting oftentimes first
01:31:44.28 --> 01:31:47.88 Your bulldogs on a chain like right and to use your here for
01:31:47.88 --> 01:31:52.36 D-fault like that's what you need to be squad leaders. You need to dial them back
01:31:52.60 --> 01:31:58.12 Dial them back right, but they're the ones talking to me so we look to your point like if I'm on the radio saying okay
01:31:58.60 --> 01:32:03.32 Let's pull back the team leaders that's a hell of a lot easier than trying to get multiple units to attack
01:32:03.32 --> 01:32:08.68 Yeah, right because as a leader like God what people don't understand is as a young leader in combat
01:32:08.68 --> 01:32:12.04 Isn't not only are you trying to maneuver your troops and identify where the enemy is
01:32:12.60 --> 01:32:16.84 To to counterattack you've got a de-conflict air corridors
01:32:16.92 --> 01:32:22.20 You've got a brink you've got it if you've got a mortar and then you're firing a mortar and an Apache comes in and you stop firing the mortar
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:25.88 So you don't knock the Apache out of the sky. I mean you've got a there's all sorts of things
01:32:25.88 --> 01:32:27.64 You've got to take into consideration
01:32:27.64 --> 01:32:30.84 So you have you almost have to have a default position
01:32:30.84 --> 01:32:37.72 And in combat it sure's how better be aggressive because like there's what else is there like you default defensive?
01:32:38.28 --> 01:32:44.12 No, that's not a thing and by the way those those moments those seconds that
01:32:44.84 --> 01:32:46.52 That it would take to
01:32:46.76 --> 01:32:53.16 Give the order of hey, we're gonna attack those seconds are the seconds where you actually win like those seconds are the time
01:32:53.16 --> 01:32:57.40 We win it's like oh yeah, we if we wait three seconds right now
01:32:57.40 --> 01:33:01.24 We give up the we give up the superior position to the enemy right now
01:33:01.96 --> 01:33:07.80 Oh my god no question. I mean at the at the at the height of our operational skill and Afghanistan
01:33:08.28 --> 01:33:12.84 Where we killed so many of the enemy and we were there for so long that we knew the train better than them
01:33:13.56 --> 01:33:19.64 It was it was just you know say battle drill, but it was almost like an un-arpotune as a collectively
01:33:20.04 --> 01:33:22.92 Reactor on unconscious level to these attacks to where
01:33:22.92 --> 01:33:30.36 Squat as team leaders and squads with attack instantly and I would have one of five's down range in less than 10 seconds on target
01:33:30.36 --> 01:33:35.24 I mean and it was just a it was just methodical it was just
01:33:36.04 --> 01:33:38.68 It was surgical and I don't think I've ever
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:44.36 So I always look at like I've always been I've only been on like two championships sports teams in my life right
01:33:44.92 --> 01:33:46.92 Each time I think it's two more than me
01:33:46.92 --> 01:33:48.92 I know I'm definitely
01:33:48.92 --> 01:33:54.36 By only first place trophy in wrestling was my first year wrestling tournament. It was like this little trope is the only first one
01:33:54.68 --> 01:33:56.68 Only first place trophy I ever had
01:33:57.16 --> 01:34:02.04 But it was just there was something special about those teams when we won championship
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:09.08 We just had it we had something I don't know what it was quality quality to the to the team that made a successful
01:34:09.08 --> 01:34:11.24 My普 Tune was like that you know it was like a
01:34:11.96 --> 01:34:13.48 You know there's another great
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:21.40 Leadership point in throughout this book in that is that you had this awesome decentralized command going on and you
01:34:22.04 --> 01:34:26.20 You explain it you don't use the word decentralized command. I don't think but
01:34:27.56 --> 01:34:32.28 You you're explaining what's going on and you're like oh I got to the top of this perimeter and when I got there
01:34:32.76 --> 01:34:37.40 You know sergeant so and so was putting his machine gun over there sergeant so and so had this perimeter set up
01:34:37.40 --> 01:34:39.48 Sergeant so and so was taken some high ground over there
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:44.76 Everyone you hadn't told them to do a damn thing all you said was like go up there and everybody okay
01:34:44.76 --> 01:34:47.88 Okay, okay the boss wants us to take the high ground when they get up there
01:34:47.88 --> 01:34:51.80 They look what obviously we could take the high ground we're gonna set up a perimeter where you get scared
01:34:51.80 --> 01:34:55.32 We're gonna set fire in lands. They did all that stuff themselves nice to explain that to these young
01:34:56.04 --> 01:34:57.64 Like task unit commanders
01:34:57.64 --> 01:35:04.60 You know they where where things would get bogged down and people be waiting like a fire team leader would be waiting to be told like hey
01:35:04.60 --> 01:35:12.28 Get your get your heavy weapon over on that corner so you get good vantage point over this direction where we're looking down in this value like
01:35:13.64 --> 01:35:16.84 You can't tell eight fire team leaders what to do I
01:35:17.08 --> 01:35:24.20 It's I used to tell my we used to train on this right I used to tell my team leaders and my subordinate leaders like first of all
01:35:24.20 --> 01:35:28.04 I want you to have the freedom and flexibility to react on your own
01:35:28.04 --> 01:35:36.36 But I need you to handle the implied task if I tell you that you need to go from point eight to point b and knock out that machine gun
01:35:36.36 --> 01:35:39.64 Nest I'm just gonna tell you go take out that machine gun Nest
01:35:39.80 --> 01:35:43.72 I'm not gonna tell you to maneuver to the rock and then stop and then set up your machine no
01:35:43.72 --> 01:35:48.92 It's it's up to you as a leader. I delegate back to you to just get it done because guess what?
01:35:48.92 --> 01:35:52.92 I don't have time for that shit. I got other things going on so and so that would to me
01:35:52.92 --> 01:35:57.96 It's like like any time a soldier would come up to me if a hey sir like where do you want me to put that mic hey, man?
01:35:57.96 --> 01:36:01.56 I need you to handle the applied task brother like you know go hand the way figure it out
01:36:01.56 --> 01:36:03.56 you know
01:36:03.56 --> 01:36:06.92 So there's a command of execution like my command of execution is
01:36:07.72 --> 01:36:10.12 Knock out that machine gun Nest or hold the line here
01:36:11.24 --> 01:36:15.48 They got to do what they got to do to do it. You know, I don't think you're done. Yeah, you got it and so to that extent
01:36:15.48 --> 01:36:17.48 I guess it is sort of decentralized
01:36:17.48 --> 01:36:21.24 That's absolutely decentralized. Your book is filled with decentralized command you guys ran it beautifully
01:36:21.24 --> 01:36:24.84 I just sort of stumbled upon it. I feel like you're you're the pro at it
01:36:24.84 --> 01:36:26.28 I just sort of stumbled upon it
01:36:26.28 --> 01:36:29.64 Well, it's somewhat of funny by practice it's really easy for me to recognize and you know
01:36:29.64 --> 01:36:34.28 Somewhere along the line someone told you like hey you better let your squad leaders do this or you figured out for yourself
01:36:34.28 --> 01:36:37.40 Hey, I can't I can't tell you exactly what to do. I'm gonna tell you
01:36:38.12 --> 01:36:42.28 You need to figure out how you're gonna get done and absolutely and when you do that I mean
01:36:42.28 --> 01:36:46.36 It's healthy for a unit and platoon and a team because there's a system sense of accomplishment
01:36:46.36 --> 01:36:50.84 If you're supporting at leaders when they get it done and do it right. Oh, yeah, and also there's a little something called ownership
01:36:50.84 --> 01:36:56.28 Which is you know when you tell me to go do something and I go and figure out how I'm gonna do it by myself
01:36:56.52 --> 01:37:01.72 Then I actually take ownership of getting it done and I feel even more accomplishment
01:37:01.72 --> 01:37:06.20 So I'm not just accomplishing what you told me to do I'm accomplishing what I figured out how we were gonna do
01:37:06.20 --> 01:37:09.16 No question and then when that happens it also makes people proud of their
01:37:09.72 --> 01:37:15.56 And then they start teaching their their lower and listed people on how to do it as well right and so
01:37:15.96 --> 01:37:19.000 Like that's our big thing is like I don't as a leader, right?
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.16 I would tell all of my guys like I don't give we don't train for what we think combat would be like we train for
01:37:25.16 --> 01:37:29.24 We trained it like just react and react effectively so in order to do that
01:37:30.04 --> 01:37:35.96 Everybody in this platoon needs to know the job of the guy of an Ethan and the job of the guy above him and we train on all that stuff
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:40.20 And so the hope was is that we could establish some form of decentralized command and
01:37:40.84 --> 01:37:41.88 each
01:37:41.88 --> 01:37:44.52 Troop each soldier in my platoon could perform
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:49.16 The jobs it we're it's true. I mean God you take a you take a casually somebody to get Scott for a bit somebody gets killed
01:37:49.40 --> 01:37:54.68 Somebody immediately has to step in that Trent step into that position step into that leadership position with no hesitation
01:37:54.68 --> 01:37:58.12 It takes you know so it's a way it's got to be so wait it's got to be
01:37:59.80 --> 01:38:07.40 Going back to the book we're in up once again. I'm fast forwarding giant swaths of incredible information here
01:38:09.56 --> 01:38:12.68 So get the books you can hear it all you're on a mountain top
01:38:12.68 --> 01:38:14.68 It's June 10th
01:38:16.20 --> 01:38:18.20 Back to the book all elements
01:38:18.68 --> 01:38:24.92 This is black hawk three six we'll be starting we'll be standing two in 15 mics
01:38:24.92 --> 01:38:28.60 My four of the truck commanders acknowledge we spent the night waiting for a
01:38:29.24 --> 01:38:33.46 Gailong how you say his name good lang good lang and this guy is the the bad guy in this book
01:38:33.46 --> 01:38:37.40 And you again because I'm only reading little tiny parts of this incredible book
01:38:37.40 --> 01:38:40.44 You have to get the books you can get the full details of gellang
01:38:40.44 --> 01:38:44.08 Yeah, I feel like for you guys he probably be a high value target man
01:38:44.08 --> 01:38:48.44 MBT I mean, but he was the local commander in our area and he was a badass man
01:38:48.44 --> 01:38:50.44 He fought against the right me knew what he was doing
01:38:50.60 --> 01:38:56.60 Yeah, he was he's like he's the one that's setting up all these really good like when when that first ambush you were in
01:38:58.44 --> 01:39:00.36 First of all I'm surprised you guys got out of there
01:39:00.36 --> 01:39:05.48 Me too and I think to myself if I could have been the ambusher in that like you know
01:39:05.48 --> 01:39:09.84 You think man you're you're gonna kill everyone like it's a miracle that you guys made a great leadership
01:39:09.84 --> 01:39:16.36 It's great reaction by your troops, but that this guy is a pro. I mean, it's what I'm trying to say for sure
01:39:16.36 --> 01:39:20.04 Guys, I mean look man. They were hitting like there were bullet holes
01:39:20.04 --> 01:39:24.20 We had mark 19s the feed trays like there were bullet holes stitched across the top of them
01:39:24.20 --> 01:39:29.40 That's how close some of the rounds were coming to hit my gunners and I mean all of that
01:39:29.40 --> 01:39:31.52 I feel like it's true like a little bit of luck
01:39:31.52 --> 01:39:35.04 I mean there's something else out there. I feel like we were just blessed or lucky or whatever
01:39:35.04 --> 01:39:38.52 You want to call it man, but we always we always take blessings and luck
01:39:38.52 --> 01:39:45.72 For sure. Yeah, take cool take that. It's especially especially good. We're good. We're from the high ground
01:39:46.96 --> 01:39:48.46 Yeah
01:39:48.46 --> 01:39:52.000 So now the morning chill upon us. I shivered in my filthy clothes
01:39:52.44 --> 01:39:56.64 We made it a standard practice wake up an hour before dawn while out
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000 Beyond the F.O.B. like this
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.60 Experience had shown that the enemy loved to launch attacks this time in the morning
01:40:03.60 --> 01:40:07.88 Soon all 24 my men were up in position waiting to see what the enemy would make a move
01:40:07.88 --> 01:40:13.000 I think I put I think I circled that just because I always like the idea of standing too
01:40:13.84 --> 01:40:17.76 And it did it all the time and also because my guys hated it my guys hated it
01:40:17.76 --> 01:40:21.60 You did it all the time. You I learned that from an old Australian essay
01:40:21.60 --> 01:40:25.000 Ask guy he's like you gotta wake up an hour before the sun comes up be ready
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.44 Everybody be the first mover of the day man. I mean that's just that was my thing
01:40:28.44 --> 01:40:31.24 It's like you set the tone you set the tone early right and
01:40:31.24 --> 01:40:33.88 No one wants to do it and and
01:40:34.60 --> 01:40:38.68 Typically to me if it's uncomfortable like that and no one wants to do it. There's a reason why we do it
01:40:38.68 --> 01:40:45.84 You know, okay and and you hear all the time if complacency kills right? Well, there's no way and hell that I was gonna allow that to happen to my troops
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:49.76 Yep, you know if I if I'm the cool guy if I'm the guy letting let and
01:40:49.76 --> 01:40:52.60 Trupper's get away with shit like taking off their helmets or whatever
01:40:52.60 --> 01:40:58.68 Unbutton and their helmets straps and their turrets then and someone gets killed like I'm the guy that has to look for that forever
01:40:58.68 --> 01:41:04.68 So those tough decisions about like waking up early standing in the proper uniform wearing the right eye protection
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:09.36 I mean come on if you let a soldier downgrade their uniform and downgrade their protective gear
01:41:09.76 --> 01:41:11.76 Someone gets hurt. I mean
01:41:11.92 --> 01:41:14.20 It's just something that you don't want to ever have to live with no
01:41:16.40 --> 01:41:18.40 While you're up there on this
01:41:18.40 --> 01:41:22.04 Observation point you guys call for our till we on a ridge line and
01:41:22.04 --> 01:41:29.64 And because you you suspected it would be an area where they were storing or launching rockets from there's a big cave site there
01:41:29.84 --> 01:41:34.36 That we knew that they were using from one side of pet there entering the cave from Pakistan
01:41:35.16 --> 01:41:39.72 Exiting the cave from Afghanistan to stay out at you know, we had ISR and Predator in the area
01:41:39.72 --> 01:41:44.36 And we're like how are these guys smuggling these rockets in we ended up identifying a cave site where they were doing it from
01:41:44.88 --> 01:41:49.34 So back to the book a few minutes later the first 105 millimeter artillery shell
01:41:49.34 --> 01:41:56.02 Torra across the sky and exploded on the west slope of the mountain more change more shells rained down our gunners at Burmel
01:41:56.46 --> 01:42:03.06 We're dead on even better. They threw in a mix of ground and airburst creating a lethal all chill artillery cocktail
01:42:03.06 --> 01:42:05.06 I watched from the edge of our perimeter
01:42:06.62 --> 01:42:09.26 Wondering how anyone could survive such firepower
01:42:10.14 --> 01:42:18.50 Mission complete so our sir roiter reported that was your RTO rooter yeah, yeah, yeah, I chose my who's my FL my four days
01:42:18.50 --> 01:42:23.04 Okay, so I would I would plot out the maps like call it to him. He called it in yeah
01:42:23.04 --> 01:42:26.74 He squared away throughout this book. He's just on it. He is he's amazing
01:42:26.74 --> 01:42:31.18 And he I mean he had to be he's not like a pilot now. He's a black-hawk pilot now, but yeah, he's amazing
01:42:31.18 --> 01:42:34.02 I turned and started to walk back to my home fee
01:42:34.30 --> 01:42:38.76 Ha ha rudder how about that I asked for the smile happiness is good indirect sir
01:42:39.26 --> 01:42:43.94 Fired you standard refrain for our for our four-dives river like to use
01:42:43.94 --> 01:42:49.18 He was right to indirect firegable platoon like ours an awesome amount of destructive power
01:42:49.18 --> 01:42:53.66 I flipped a glance over my shoulder at the smoke smothered mountain top your play assholes
01:42:53.66 --> 01:42:59.98 I'd walked about halfway back to my rig and was just passing a thick pine tree when I called out to rooter again
01:43:00.34 --> 01:43:02.90 Let's see what those bastards are saying on the radio is now
01:43:03.14 --> 01:43:10.22 But before I he could respond ruder and everything in my view disappeared as a curtain to had just dropped before my eyes
01:43:11.10 --> 01:43:12.46 blackness
01:43:12.46 --> 01:43:21.62 Nothing where am I the morning scene in the Hindu Kush had vanished replaced by an endless void Sean that voice
01:43:21.62 --> 01:43:23.14 Sean you need to get up
01:43:23.14 --> 01:43:26.94 Grand pap Sean you have to wake up now. I struggled to see him
01:43:26.94 --> 01:43:33.18 But he stayed cloaked in the velvet darkness. I was left only with the smooth comfort of his voice get up
01:43:33.18 --> 01:43:35.18 Sean you got to get up get up for me
01:43:35.74 --> 01:43:38.50 Something stung my face. I tried to look and see what it just hit me
01:43:38.50 --> 01:43:45.42 But I could not penetrate the void am I dreaming? I tried to shake my head, but I couldn't find fire the right neurons instead
01:43:45.42 --> 01:43:51.18 I floated captive to whatever moment this was another sting on my face at least I could feel something
01:43:51.18 --> 01:43:56.58 I wanted to move my hand up and touch my cheek and defend against whatever kept hitting me my hand refused to obey
01:43:56.58 --> 01:44:02.06 I felt disembodied as if somehow my conscious had been separated from my material form
01:44:02.86 --> 01:44:04.86 Sean get up
01:44:04.86 --> 01:44:06.86 A
01:44:07.94 --> 01:44:11.82 Telephone buzzed in my ears now the ringing was all I could hear disoriented
01:44:11.82 --> 01:44:17.66 I tried to look around and realize I was flat on my back perhaps 15 feet from where I last remembered standing the tree
01:44:17.66 --> 01:44:21.94 I'd been passing looked as though a giant head snap that in half
01:44:22.78 --> 01:44:29.90 Then I saw Sabaki his face was smeared with blood his IBA stained crimson with it in a sudden rush my hearing came back
01:44:29.90 --> 01:44:37.30 I went from nothing but the telephone to a hurricane of sounds in my in a heartbeat the switch blitzed my nervous system
01:44:37.30 --> 01:44:43.62 Furnace and I was helpless against the century overload swamped by staccato burst of 50 cowl explosions and screams
01:44:43.82 --> 01:44:45.42 Sir, sir, are you okay?
01:44:45.42 --> 01:44:51.26 Statler staltor staltor shouted at me why wouldn't I be he smacked me again?
01:44:51.42 --> 01:44:53.42 Sir, you got blown the fuck up
01:44:54.42 --> 01:44:56.42 Yeah, that's what you like
01:44:56.42 --> 01:44:58.42 Like what was it a border?
01:44:58.42 --> 01:45:04.94 Yeah, so so yes, it was an airburst mortar and so we had heard
01:45:06.58 --> 01:45:12.82 We had heard the enemy during our stand to right talking on their icons about moving the rockets to the cave
01:45:12.82 --> 01:45:17.70 And I'm like whoa hot damn. I know exactly where you are and so I called in the artillery
01:45:19.18 --> 01:45:24.30 But what we didn't realize was is that the enemy had been planning attack there all night
01:45:24.30 --> 01:45:29.66 Right and they were planning to attack us they had identified our observation post they had conducted
01:45:29.66 --> 01:45:31.26 Reconnaissance on us the all night
01:45:31.42 --> 01:45:35.14 They identified who the key leaders were over several hours worth of a cup of silence
01:45:35.14 --> 01:45:41.82 We had no idea that we were there until the next morning, but we didn't realize that the icon chatter that we were hearing was them planning and attack
01:45:42.18 --> 01:45:44.18 Now that's stand to is what
01:45:44.86 --> 01:45:47.50 Saved us and because we got hit them first and
01:45:49.18 --> 01:45:53.62 But it was based it was like hitting a hornets nest with a baseball bat
01:45:53.62 --> 01:45:58.48 You know they had they had maneuver still gonna get stoned. Yes. Yes, yes
01:45:59.20 --> 01:46:02.30 And so I remember watching those rounds which were fired charge eight right?
01:46:02.30 --> 01:46:07.58 So we talked about charge eight on our tellaries like rocket at rap rocket assisted projectiles for artillery
01:46:07.58 --> 01:46:13.30 Is that there's a tactical and herant tactical risk involved there's at the rocket charge can flip the gun
01:46:13.30 --> 01:46:15.30 So you have the balances a leader
01:46:15.94 --> 01:46:18.44 Will a tactical effects of this fire out
01:46:18.44 --> 01:46:24.76 Outway the potential tactical risk of the guns flipping and then being ineffective. I had to make that call
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.96 Fire the guns the rounds impacted right where I wanted them to walk back to my truck and
01:46:32.24 --> 01:46:40.20 Just the entire the whole world goes black for me in that moment and I remember coming to stalker slapped my face and laughing and I'm like shaking right I couldn't
01:46:40.20 --> 01:46:42.92 I know it was like that black sense of humor
01:46:42.92 --> 01:46:45.60 You know it's funny because you didn't say in the book he was laughing
01:46:45.60 --> 01:46:51.44 He was like, but I know that attitude right there. He's got a chance to smack the L.T
01:46:52.08 --> 01:46:57.52 And he's straddling my chest like he's like sit like it's he's like straddle and over me like slap me in the face and
01:46:58.12 --> 01:47:02.64 I'm like laying on my back and I'm looking to my left and the first thing that I see is my
01:47:02.64 --> 01:47:07.64 Patoon sergeant. This is a guy who's been in the military for 20 plus years. This is grease and yeah
01:47:07.64 --> 01:47:11.20 Grison who's in Panama jumped in with Panama. It was with the 75th year. Yeah, yeah
01:47:11.20 --> 01:47:13.52 He's old old school like you like you you know
01:47:13.52 --> 01:47:15.52 But he's
01:47:16.08 --> 01:47:19.28 He's he's pointing to his back taking cover behind this big
01:47:19.64 --> 01:47:23.36 Tree point to his back. It taken sharp no theirs back his covered in blood
01:47:23.36 --> 01:47:28.92 Sabos wounded who's my weapon squad leader my second most senior NCO in the Patoon in fact
01:47:30.36 --> 01:47:34.24 Every key leader of my Patoon was mooted in the first 60 seconds of that engagement
01:47:34.64 --> 01:47:41.84 Every and I was down and out myself and so I mean I'm looking around me. What were your wounds at the time?
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:48.40 We didn't know um later it was either and that a fracture in my skull and two three different places and I had a cerebral spinal fluid leak
01:47:48.40 --> 01:47:53.28 And so I was when I sat up and the clear fluid that leaked was leaking out of my nose
01:47:53.28 --> 01:47:55.44 And was leaching out of my ears for a couple weeks
01:47:55.44 --> 01:48:02.04 It was as a result from those hairline fractures in my skull and this cerebral spinal fluid is the stuff that cushions your
01:48:02.48 --> 01:48:07.40 Brain from your skull and it was just leaking out like you know and that ended up healing on its own
01:48:07.40 --> 01:48:09.92 But again, this was back in
01:48:09.92 --> 01:48:13.44 2005 like soldiers today are getting feedback for injuries like that
01:48:13.44 --> 01:48:18.32 But this was before TBI was even an acronym it wasn't even a thing so so anyway
01:48:18.32 --> 01:48:19.76 we're we're like I
01:48:19.76 --> 01:48:23.76 Sit up and the rate of fire was so heavy I
01:48:24.48 --> 01:48:30.12 Mean so I'm watching these airburst mortars hit us and I know that they're not impacting on the ground
01:48:30.12 --> 01:48:33.52 Right, but they're hitting above us and I could be and I'm watching the tops of trees
01:48:33.52 --> 01:48:39.22 I'm just explode these are trees that have been untouched by humanity for what probably
01:48:39.64 --> 01:48:42.72 150 years, you know, they're big huge trees and
01:48:43.60 --> 01:48:48.32 We're watching these things explode. I'm looking at my hand, which is laying on the ground and there
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:54.80 There are rounds impacting like right between my forefinger my I mean, it was just insane
01:48:55.44 --> 01:49:00.20 Everywhere I looked it was like the dirt was on fire because machine gun rounds were just
01:49:00.20 --> 01:49:05.88 In our perimeter all around us and I remember being stalked or graphing about my my body
01:49:05.88 --> 01:49:12.32 Our pulls me up clear fluid leaks out of my nose and I'm looking to the to the ridge lines and then in the darkness
01:49:12.32 --> 01:49:18.92 I couldn't really tell it was a tactical mistake on my part that there were two hills directly east of our position that were taller than ours
01:49:19.92 --> 01:49:21.92 Yeah, and
01:49:21.92 --> 01:49:24.76 From those hill tops the enemy had three machine guns
01:49:24.76 --> 01:49:30.48 A piece like and they were they were again. They were barking the guns. They were talking the guns and
01:49:31.72 --> 01:49:36.76 They were they weren't just doing that they were they were using plunging fire to drop the rounds into our position
01:49:36.76 --> 01:49:41.48 So in other words, they were fire and I'm on a trajectory where they would arc up and land in the middle of us
01:49:41.48 --> 01:49:43.48 So that even if you were taking cover
01:49:43.48 --> 01:49:48.84 Behind a deflator something the round could theoretically land on top of you they were hitting us with airburst mortars
01:49:48.84 --> 01:49:52.84 And as I'm sitting there trying to take in this fight like holy shit like
01:49:52.84 --> 01:49:59.48 They have us dead to rights here. There's no way we're getting out of this and and you guys are in a 360 degree perimeter
01:49:59.48 --> 01:50:04.04 Yeah, I've got five of them these five five gun trucks 24 troops on the ground
01:50:04.36 --> 01:50:11.32 One interpreter. I got 250 caliber machine guns one mark 19 one 240 brow that's mounted and two other dismounted 240 brow was in my trucks
01:50:11.88 --> 01:50:13.88 so
01:50:13.88 --> 01:50:18.72 We're the and they were positioned in 360 degree security on top of this big hill top
01:50:19.88 --> 01:50:21.08 Big hill top
01:50:21.08 --> 01:50:23.72 I had the third biggest hill top in the area
01:50:26.60 --> 01:50:34.68 See it must have my second the third biggest hill top of the area yeah, and I got my troops in her spursed and on the eastern most portion of that perimeter was Sabaki and Baldwin
01:50:34.68 --> 01:50:36.68 And I look towards there
01:50:36.68 --> 01:50:39.32 To where they are and their trucks are totally destroyed
01:50:40.12 --> 01:50:45.72 I see Baldwin he's got a bullet in his shin and he's bleeding all over the afghan dirt
01:50:45.72 --> 01:50:50.68 And I remember like what struck me in that moment is that he's not trying to treat his own injury
01:50:51.32 --> 01:50:57.96 He's trying to treat his team leader who has been at Garbin who had taken a tumbling a K around to the four arm an almost severed his arm and
01:50:57.96 --> 01:51:03.80 The entry went itself was this big the exit wind was even bigger. I mean his arm was hanging by thread
01:51:04.52 --> 01:51:06.44 Baldwin was trying to get a turn it could on there
01:51:06.44 --> 01:51:10.28 I remember looking at Baldwin's face. He was just ghost white. He was bleeding out
01:51:10.28 --> 01:51:16.44 Emric was my a gunner and one of my turrets. He's up in the turret on the 50 cow he gets shot in the head drops in the turret
01:51:16.76 --> 01:51:18.76 He pops back up gets on the gun
01:51:19.32 --> 01:51:23.96 I did a kid that was in my petune. This is very first patrol Kyle Lewis is on another gun
01:51:23.96 --> 01:51:27.32 I watch him get shot in the head in the turret him fall down him get back up
01:51:27.48 --> 01:51:30.52 We're talking their helmets have rat like in and out
01:51:31.16 --> 01:51:33.16 You know from from a bullet like and
01:51:33.56 --> 01:51:35.56 Somehow these dudes survive
01:51:35.56 --> 01:51:37.56 My guy stayed in the fight somehow
01:51:37.56 --> 01:51:39.56 But we ended up getting attacked that day by
01:51:40.92 --> 01:51:46.84 I mean you know you and the predator analysis after the fight once we finally got predator on station over 200 guys
01:51:46.84 --> 01:51:53.24 That's sergeant majors just count them one two three four five over 200 to my 24 and so
01:51:54.44 --> 01:51:58.68 So what was crazy about that attack was that the enemy had the enemy had
01:52:00.04 --> 01:52:05.96 They had simultaneously in place to support by fire positions and they had us in a crossfire and they were hit no
01:52:05.96 --> 01:52:11.64 Disappointing fire but in order to get those support by fire positions in place without us noticing them
01:52:11.64 --> 01:52:14.92 They hit us with indirect airburst mortars, which is what kept our heads down
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.76 Right so we're getting hit with our artillery. I'm knocked out everyone's taking cover
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:26.36 They in place these support by fire positions. They put us in a crossfire and I'm thinking as a young lieutenant like okay shit like we're dead to rights
01:52:27.32 --> 01:52:31.40 What's next and I'm realizing at the time that these guys are fighting just like we do
01:52:31.40 --> 01:52:35.16 This is exactly what I would do get in the same situation and I'm thinking to myself
01:52:35.16 --> 01:52:42.92 If I were them I would attack and it wasn't but a minute that that thought had dawned on me
01:52:42.92 --> 01:52:47.48 That I see that we get attacked from those hilltop from two successive positions from 40 man
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:51.48 Pultune size elements like bounding down the hill
01:52:52.28 --> 01:52:56.52 Into the valley below and up towards our position and it I mean I just it just was so crazy
01:52:57.48 --> 01:53:03.08 We start calling in fire danger close on our position and it was just was watching one of five rounds
01:53:03.08 --> 01:53:07.08 Vaporized men like on in the deflating the low ground below
01:53:07.08 --> 01:53:10.36 But it wasn't and not I mean was not stopping him didn't matter what we threw at them
01:53:10.36 --> 01:53:12.36 They were just so many of them
01:53:12.36 --> 01:53:15.32 We kill one two more would replace it. They were they had just
01:53:16.28 --> 01:53:18.28 Amassed a force there that
01:53:18.92 --> 01:53:20.36 No matter what we threw at them
01:53:20.60 --> 01:53:24.04 It wouldn't it wasn't stopping them. We were I mean all around my perimeter
01:53:24.44 --> 01:53:28.28 You know we're going black on ammunition. I got my squad that you're screaming that they're going black on ammunition
01:53:28.28 --> 01:53:31.32 I'm thinking of like Joshua Chamberland and like holy shit
01:53:31.32 --> 01:53:35.48 I'm gonna have to order a pay net char and time to the teeth of the enemy and then I remember
01:53:36.04 --> 01:53:42.36 This computer by trice like thinking Jesus Christ the army doesn't issue us bay and that's anymore like this is like this is crazy
01:53:42.76 --> 01:53:48.12 So everyone starts grabbing their side arms starts grabbing knives. You're ready to fight and then we fight them to a
01:53:49.48 --> 01:53:53.88 Almost like a stalemate they didn't quite get to the top of our hill or blowing clay more minds
01:53:53.88 --> 01:53:58.36 We're yelling back and forth and I remember sitting on the easternmost perimeter with my guys
01:53:58.36 --> 01:54:03.56 You can see these long knives hanging from their belts. We fight them to a stalemate and I'm starting thinking like okay
01:54:03.56 --> 01:54:06.04 I gotta start getting these casualties out of here because they're all bleeding to death
01:54:06.52 --> 01:54:08.52 So we start trying to evacuate Baldwin
01:54:10.60 --> 01:54:12.76 Or evacuate Garvin we get over there
01:54:13.08 --> 01:54:17.64 Baldwin's like take Garvin first so our medic dock pantoha grabs him picks him up
01:54:18.04 --> 01:54:25.80 Starts carrying a back and boom once pantoha our medic get shot in the face and drop and thinking my medic is dead Jesus Christ like in this whole time
01:54:25.80 --> 01:54:30.44 I'm just what's the time frame that we're talking about right now like how long is this good thing going on?
01:54:32.28 --> 01:54:36.44 Probably up into this point probably at least an hour and a half
01:54:36.92 --> 01:54:39.32 We couldn't get close air support either because our
01:54:39.96 --> 01:54:45.88 Like rotaryering and fixed wing support were divided down south through a troops in contact were a batina brigade commander
01:54:45.88 --> 01:54:48.76 We're involved in so we were like just left out there flappin and
01:54:50.20 --> 01:54:52.20 Who cares about
01:54:52.20 --> 01:54:57.16 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right right I mean and so Baldwin you know
01:54:57.88 --> 01:55:00.20 Pantoha goes down and I watch him stand up
01:55:01.16 --> 01:55:03.88 And I'm just like I couldn't believe this kid was still alive
01:55:04.76 --> 01:55:10.68 The entire like you know right side of his face is ruined from this bullet hole it picks up Garvin gets him to the aid station
01:55:10.68 --> 01:55:15.72 We run back for Baldwin get hit with another arpego get hit with an RPG this time. I I go flying
01:55:15.80 --> 01:55:19.88 Pantoha goes flying we get back up grab balled when get him to the casually collection point
01:55:19.88 --> 01:55:21.88 Um, we know we start
01:55:22.92 --> 01:55:29.24 Trying to prep them for evac at turnic it's on render first aid and what was the cast of act plan?
01:55:29.64 --> 01:55:31.16 How are you gonna get him out of there?
01:55:31.16 --> 01:55:36.20 Well the cast of act plan we were trying to coordinate with the Marines and an a back at the base to come out here and link up
01:55:36.20 --> 01:55:43.80 So that was a vehicular yeah, yeah, yeah, there wasn't gonna be a helicopter's coming correct and that that is that
01:55:44.44 --> 01:55:48.60 The truly difficult thing about Afghanistan and the challenges that you face with the terrain there
01:55:48.60 --> 01:55:54.44 Sometimes in the weather right so if the weather is cloudy and there's a low ceiling the birds aren't flying
01:55:54.44 --> 01:55:56.36 You're out there operating somebody gets shot
01:55:56.44 --> 01:55:58.44 Severus and artery the birds aren't coming
01:55:59.08 --> 01:56:03.24 And there's no way you're gonna evacom back to a level of care where they're gonna survive
01:56:03.80 --> 01:56:09.80 The tactical risk and Afghanistan in this regard is just it's just astronomical with regards to casualties on that day
01:56:10.44 --> 01:56:14.76 I mean the fighting was so heavy there was no way we were getting a blackhawk in there to evacuate
01:56:14.76 --> 01:56:20.76 And there's no way we can have a blackhawk lord here and get a jungle penetrator ran to get a get a there's no way and hell no one was coming so it had to be
01:56:21.72 --> 01:56:23.72 vehicular Kazevac
01:56:23.72 --> 01:56:26.36 Conduct link up on the westernmost portion of our perimeter
01:56:27.96 --> 01:56:34.44 When Marines and a an a casivac slash QRF because you guys needed like legitimate quick reaction force
01:56:34.44 --> 01:56:40.92 He did oh, we were this is it this is a great and I'm telling you got to read this book, but here's a part that's
01:56:40.92 --> 01:56:45.64 To the enemies closing in like you said pinhole appeared beside me
01:56:46.28 --> 01:56:50.76 Sir were about to be overrun. We need to see our radios which for those of you those civilians
01:56:50.76 --> 01:56:56.04 I don't know your radios have a little switch on them that you can turn that erases all the
01:56:56.60 --> 01:56:57.56 All the
01:56:57.56 --> 01:57:02.36 Cryptographic material in all the secret material all the code the the special code
01:57:02.36 --> 01:57:07.96 Compsack yeah the the special code that you've got in your radio that it allows you to understand other American radios
01:57:07.96 --> 01:57:11.32 When you turn this thing to zero then it's gone
01:57:11.88 --> 01:57:14.52 That means the enemy can't take your radio and listen so
01:57:15.48 --> 01:57:22.12 But you have that switch in the event that you think you're gonna get overrun the last thing you're gonna do like literally the last thing you will do
01:57:22.68 --> 01:57:26.04 Is zero-wise your radio so at the enemy can't get on the
01:57:26.68 --> 01:57:31.56 Friendly frequencies and listen or talk or disrupt them in any way so pinhole tells you
01:57:31.96 --> 01:57:36.44 We need to see our radios which is which means that he and his mind thinks
01:57:36.44 --> 01:57:39.72 You guys are done we were you guys are done because there's no
01:57:40.20 --> 01:57:42.92 Once you realize your radio the you can't talk anymore
01:57:42.92 --> 01:57:45.96 Can't talk your own element so he's just saying look we're done
01:57:46.12 --> 01:57:52.52 We are gonna be overrun we need to zeroize our radios so the enemy doesn't get them and we're all gonna die here in the next
01:57:52.52 --> 01:57:57.96 Whatever that's where he was at mentally you come back no way I said instinctively in worst case
01:57:57.96 --> 01:58:03.24 Neras we were trained to erase the frequencies on our communication system so the enemy cannot listen to our chatter by doing so
01:58:03.24 --> 01:58:07.72 We would lose all ability to call for more fire support so we need to do it
01:58:07.72 --> 01:58:10.44 He actually pushed back so we need to do it pinhole to access
01:58:10.92 --> 01:58:18.84 Insisted no we cannot lose our links to the fob both enemy assault elements had cleared their own slopes now when we're pouring across the valley floor
01:58:19.16 --> 01:58:24.60 100 men at least how many did we have left a dozen maybe pinhole was right
01:58:25.80 --> 01:58:27.80 We lose our radio link we all die
01:58:27.80 --> 01:58:33.72 Router I shouted turning to my four-dabs river who is sitting in my home view with the radio handset to his mouth sir
01:58:33.96 --> 01:58:37.72 Call in anything you can work the fire missions danger close got it
01:58:38.12 --> 01:58:43.08 Yes, sir he keyed the handset and began barking coordinates. I looked at my RTO
01:58:43.64 --> 01:58:51.28 Do not see these radios they go down we all go down got it yes sir good grab a radio and come with me
01:58:51.28 --> 01:58:53.28 I
01:58:55.76 --> 01:59:00.08 Can't I can't I mean I can't believe that that I mean Jesus man I
01:59:01.52 --> 01:59:03.52 Yeah, that's where you know my men
01:59:04.80 --> 01:59:08.32 I remember the feeling on top of that hill that day my men all had
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:12.64 You know nine miles in the truck but just just enough rounds to take the
01:59:12.64 --> 01:59:17.92 Rown life should be be overrun because we were not gonna allow ourselves to be taken captive by these guys
01:59:17.92 --> 01:59:21.28 I don't know that sounds morbid, but that was just the truth with you know
01:59:22.56 --> 01:59:27.60 And that's where a lot of the guys were I mean they were still in the fight right they were still gonna fight to the very bitter end
01:59:27.60 --> 01:59:33.76 But it comes to point time where you're out of ammo and they got more ammo than you there. They're among you
01:59:34.88 --> 01:59:36.88 That's where we were
01:59:36.88 --> 01:59:40.32 That's where we were I checked with Router any birds and route
01:59:40.96 --> 01:59:44.40 Negative sir all the arrows so assets are tied up elsewhere keep trying
01:59:44.40 --> 01:59:49.44 I how to up with grease and a good dynamic existed between the two of us. I was always the hot one
01:59:49.44 --> 01:59:52.64 He ran cold and kept me grounded we become so close
01:59:52.64 --> 01:59:56.96 We could finish each other's thoughts throughout the fight we didn't even have to communicate much
01:59:57.28 --> 02:00:02.56 But all along we functioned smoothly as a team grease and yes, I regret through dirt crusted lips
02:00:02.88 --> 02:00:04.40 What's our next play
02:00:04.40 --> 02:00:10.08 Somebody screamed they're coming again the sound of gunfire grew fast and desperate the temple the fight was changed
02:00:10.08 --> 02:00:15.28 Was changing building I looked at grease and it saw a relentless determination etched on his face
02:00:15.76 --> 02:00:20.48 But also I saw a touch of fear fuck I don't know sir shoot back
02:00:22.48 --> 02:00:31.36 That was his plan which is where you guys were at and and I I tried what yeah when he said that I was I at that point I was like
02:00:32.48 --> 02:00:39.52 Holy shit, you know like for a lieutenant like my biggest weapon is my radio and if it's time for like me to start shooting back
02:00:39.52 --> 02:00:45.04 It's a it's a real real bad day for everybody, but that's where we were you could hear these guys
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000 Not only and you you detail this in the book it's
02:00:48.96 --> 02:00:54.64 Scary you hear him calling out all the lock bar which okay, but then what what
02:00:55.36 --> 02:00:58.000 Because we've all heard that but then you you hear the
02:00:58.72 --> 02:01:04.000 The squad and their squad and fire team leaders giving out orders you could hear that too
02:01:04.56 --> 02:01:08.64 Yeah, yeah, it was it was um and we were yelling back and forth screaming
02:01:08.64 --> 02:01:13.68 Now calling them names and stuff and they're yelling back at us when we fought him to a stalemate and this was the first
02:01:14.56 --> 02:01:19.76 This was the fight you know after grieces like shoot back and I run out to where Baldwin was because again
02:01:20.64 --> 02:01:25.44 My big thing is that if you're a leader it is your or job to be where the contact is heaviest
02:01:25.44 --> 02:01:29.76 You know, yeah, you have to coordinate other aspects of the fight, but you better be on the knife
02:01:29.76 --> 02:01:31.92 Said to where the hip fighting is heaviest and so
02:01:32.64 --> 02:01:38.20 You know ran back out to the easternmost portion of the perimeter and that's where I first that's that's when I first pulled my trigger and took a life
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:43.80 Was in that engagement at that moment and it was at the moment where watching and witnessing these
02:01:45.48 --> 02:01:53.72 These their team leaders. I mean they're changing command yelling fire commands and bound commands and maneuver commands to their subordinate team leaders and it was just
02:01:54.76 --> 02:01:58.84 I mean we knew that they were well trained because of the first engagement that we were in with them
02:01:58.84 --> 02:02:05.56 Right we knew that they knew how to fight, but it was a whole another thing to see their command to control and how fast they were on the battlefield
02:02:05.56 --> 02:02:07.56 They were way faster than we were
02:02:08.92 --> 02:02:12.84 Yeah, well they're a lot lighter, too. That's right. I mean, that's one thing
02:02:12.84 --> 02:02:16.52 They have this huge advantage because we wear cells down because we value human life
02:02:16.52 --> 02:02:20.12 So we wear body armor and we carry radios and
02:02:20.44 --> 02:02:23.56 They carry what they can't 404
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:25.96 Mags some frags and
02:02:26.44 --> 02:02:31.56 And there are climate ties like they're all used to running around at 12,000 feet, you know, so they
02:02:31.56 --> 02:02:39.80 Scale up the side of a mountain better than a mountain go can, you know, and that they should the people that we're fighting, you know, and what we had started to see on the battlefield
02:02:39.80 --> 02:02:46.56 You know any time you're in Afghanistan, it's like you deal with you know anything from Al Qaeda to the Connie network to hack
02:02:46.56 --> 02:02:52.04 Modear to the Taliban sometimes in this engagement what we were seeing
02:02:53.08 --> 02:02:56.72 Was cross training and so you'd see Al Qaeda foreign commanders
02:02:57.16 --> 02:03:01.24 You know commanding and leading ground troops who were just local
02:03:01.24 --> 02:03:03.24 Taliban and
02:03:03.24 --> 02:03:05.80 Man it was it was just a wicked wicked wicked fight
02:03:06.68 --> 02:03:13.80 Sometimes people will say you know jokko you talk a lot about tactics like don't you think the enemy's gonna gonna like learn these tactics
02:03:13.80 --> 02:03:18.36 I'm like the enemy absolutely knows these tactics that the tactics that talk about our cover and move
02:03:18.36 --> 02:03:22.44 You know set up support by fire positions maneuver you know like that's what I talk about time
02:03:22.60 --> 02:03:27.24 There's no secret to this stuff you either know how to do it and if you do it how well can you do it
02:03:27.24 --> 02:03:31.64 Or you don't know it and then you get slaughtered, but yeah, there's but what to hear
02:03:31.96 --> 02:03:36.84 That's exactly everything that you just said everything that you've experienced so far is exactly what
02:03:37.40 --> 02:03:42.36 We do that's what we do like that's what we do we set up ambushes we set up LM busses
02:03:42.36 --> 02:03:46.04 We set up we want to get the high ground we set up support by fire positions
02:03:46.04 --> 02:03:53.16 We bound in maneuvering leap for our elements so we cover and move for each other. That's what we do and and and knowing the tactics
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:57.16 And being entrenched in them is not enough
02:03:57.16 --> 02:04:02.04 You know and so you have course the enemy knows everything that we do our FM's are on the internet of course
02:04:02.04 --> 02:04:06.84 Like you know, but but knowing the you have to be able to take the tactics or just a baseline
02:04:06.84 --> 02:04:13.40 You've got a train and evolve and watch the enemy and and adapt and and so anytime anybody
02:04:13.40 --> 02:04:17.96 Asked me a question about tactics to it's like you have course the enemy knows our tactics and but that's not enough
02:04:17.96 --> 02:04:22.92 And if you're even asking that question it means you're slave to the tactics which can't be the tactics are a baseline
02:04:23.48 --> 02:04:27.24 And that's just like any leadership you have to be able to make command decisions on the fly of all the
02:04:27.24 --> 02:04:30.76 Dapton operate in the field and that's what you have to do to be effective in combat
02:04:30.76 --> 02:04:34.68 Yeah, and as you put as you as you related that first ambush that you got caught in
02:04:35.24 --> 02:04:38.84 There's no manual that gives the answer that you gave
02:04:39.24 --> 02:04:44.28 There's no manual you can say okay if this is where you're at first of all how you're gonna describe that how you gonna how you gonna
02:04:44.28 --> 02:04:51.000 Describe or give a scenario for every single possible combat situation that's gonna mean you it's it literally impossible to do
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.68 Because you god knows what's gonna happen out in the battlefield god knows that you're gonna be in a situation like that right there
02:04:57.16 --> 02:05:02.76 In that particular environment in that particular scenario with that particular terrain with the enemy in their situation with your
02:05:03.24 --> 02:05:04.68 troops, you know
02:05:04.92 --> 02:05:11.32 Arrange the way they are like that's only gonna happen one time and if all you know is the basic
02:05:11.32 --> 02:05:15.96 Fundamental tactics without knowing how to deviate from those tactics you're gonna get killed
02:05:15.96 --> 02:05:22.20 But if you truly understand the principles of the tactics then you can go okay here's what's going on
02:05:22.20 --> 02:05:27.000 I'm trapped we I better get the high ground and I better get it now. That's exactly right
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:31.32 I mean if you if the tactics are the only thing that you understand then you're in a near-ambut
02:05:31.32 --> 02:05:35.96 You're you know react in the your ambush charging into the I mean your dead your dead
02:05:35.96 --> 02:05:38.92 If that's your bottom line as tactics are a baseline
02:05:38.92 --> 02:05:42.12 You've got to understand the principles and be able to adapt and maneuver
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.68 Using an understanding what those principles are otherwise you're done. Yeah, you know because
02:05:47.24 --> 02:05:48.92 The one thing that combat does
02:05:48.92 --> 02:05:55.64 Better than anything else is throw you a curveball every single day. I mean you'd be at the top of your game
02:05:55.64 --> 02:06:01.40 And all of a sudden like one of your trucks your rear differential on your home V breaks and you're stuck on the side of a mountain top for three days to
02:06:01.40 --> 02:06:06.04 Everything's like what do you what do you what do you do with that? It's absolute chaos and you know
02:06:06.04 --> 02:06:14.28 What tactics bring and what training brings is a certain amount of order to that chaos and the fine line in between order and chaos is worth survival is and
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:19.000 And like you said and the same thing we I think we both just said the exact same thing
02:06:20.76 --> 02:06:25.32 Knowing the tactics knowing where the X is and zeros move on the on a chalkboard
02:06:26.12 --> 02:06:27.32 Is part of
02:06:27.40 --> 02:06:33.000 Understanding but you have to understand the actual principles that you're trying to to
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.64 In force on the battle for that's what you have to you have to understand what are the principles you have to
02:06:37.72 --> 02:06:42.44 Understand those principles once you understand those principles then you can adapt those tactics and you can maneuver and you can make things happen
02:06:42.44 --> 02:06:45.96 Which which like you said just knowing the tactics isn't good enough
02:06:46.04 --> 02:06:54.16 You have to understand the principles of why you're employing those tactics and then you can make calls and decisions that will allow you to win
02:06:54.16 --> 02:07:02.68 Going back to the book the enemy wouldn't quit the fight grew even more intense delta-platoon
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:08.80 Anchored us what we would have gone down for sure still we couldn't hold the enemy off indefinitely
02:07:08.80 --> 02:07:11.20 We needed more firepower and more men
02:07:12.40 --> 02:07:18.68 On a hill a few hundred meters to our northwest to our northwest ahead appeared over the crest then another
02:07:18.68 --> 02:07:26.20 Soon a dozen figures flowed over the hilltop and down the slope facing us they were carrying AKs
02:07:26.44 --> 02:07:32.88 More followed a dozen two dozen the lead element open fire on the run shooting from the hip like something straight out of a movie
02:07:32.88 --> 02:07:38.60 I had one mag left I'd given all my others away even with Delta's trucks
02:07:38.60 --> 02:07:42.92 We couldn't stop this fresh threat unconsciously I
02:07:43.80 --> 02:07:45.80 Clutched my Gerber knife I
02:07:45.80 --> 02:07:51.40 Can't believe it has come to this more men poured over the crest and
02:07:52.52 --> 02:07:58.36 Then I saw a Marine in their ranks their A and A I said to myself
02:07:58.76 --> 02:08:02.84 Combat whip saws your emotions in an extreme way that nothing else can
02:08:02.84 --> 02:08:09.000 I'd gone from despair to you for a no matter of seconds the afghan troops sprinted into our perimeter and
02:08:09.32 --> 02:08:11.72 Counter assaulted the enemy through our firing line
02:08:11.72 --> 02:08:17.000 Galanx men reeled from the blow and fell back pel mel to the base of the hill
02:08:17.32 --> 02:08:21.80 Several more marine homies and A and a Toyota trucks joined us from the northwest
02:08:21.88 --> 02:08:29.20 We'd gone from having five trucks three of which had been rendered immobile by damage to having 14
02:08:32.24 --> 02:08:38.28 How does I mean they combat really is an emotional roller coaster man you go from thinking that your dead one second to you know
02:08:38.28 --> 02:08:44.08 Having a shot of getting out of their alive and I remember I will never forget this an a dude like
02:08:44.08 --> 02:08:48.72 Crest in a top of that hill. He's just screaming at the top of his lungs got his AK 47 down in a side
02:08:48.72 --> 02:08:54.000 He's screaming and as he's running he's shooting the ground in front of him like that's
02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.24 I'm not thinking oh my god
02:08:56.24 --> 02:08:59.64 He's just shooting like right in the ground. I'm like oh my god
02:08:59.64 --> 02:09:02.44 Like we're getting overrun and come to find out it was the you know
02:09:02.44 --> 02:09:09.16 It was the Marines and the ANA and it was just you know the augment our position and you know they say augment our position
02:09:09.16 --> 02:09:15.28 We start crossloading ammunition and and then we fought them to a stalemate for like another four or five hours
02:09:15.56 --> 02:09:22.04 You know and we ended up getting and Apache on station and a ten and then we had a
02:09:22.84 --> 02:09:27.96 A B1 strategic Lancer on stage where we dropped I
02:09:27.96 --> 02:09:36.12 Want to say I think we dropped at least 11 2000 pound Jdams on that cave site on that ridge line and it was only after that
02:09:36.36 --> 02:09:38.96 That we could get them to even break contact in the first place
02:09:39.56 --> 02:09:42.12 It would determine it was unbelievable
02:09:42.12 --> 02:09:48.96 They were determined to overrun an American built-in and behead us that was what we learned that was what they wanted to do and from then on out
02:09:48.96 --> 02:09:51.48 That's that's the enemy that we were fighting and they were
02:09:51.48 --> 02:09:58.04 Utterly relentless and every way and if we weren't ready to face them every time we left the wire we were again
02:09:58.04 --> 02:10:00.04 We were dead to rights
02:10:00.04 --> 02:10:02.04 Just before you guys got the air support
02:10:03.24 --> 02:10:07.16 You had this unfold I'm going back to the book we got to get them to the truck's grease and order
02:10:07.16 --> 02:10:14.64 Dixon now she she white from blood loss lifted Baldwin's wounded leg with his unwounded arm the rest of us picked him up as well
02:10:14.84 --> 02:10:20.32 Staying low we moved as fast as we could off the lip of the hill down the northwest slope to the waiting humvies
02:10:20.32 --> 02:10:25.90 Before we could slide him inside the truck Baldwin cried sir, sir the turn as voice made us freeze
02:10:25.90 --> 02:10:27.90 I'm fucked up
02:10:27.90 --> 02:10:29.90 Malfopin shallow rapid bleeding
02:10:29.90 --> 02:10:34.50 He was going into shock. I could see Afghan dirt around and to his teeth
02:10:34.50 --> 02:10:39.52 You're gonna be okay, bro. I said I'm shot in the back. What when we all went down
02:10:39.92 --> 02:10:43.72 Baldwin took around at the base of his spine. We had no idea until that moment. I
02:10:44.32 --> 02:10:46.32 Can't feel my legs
02:10:46.32 --> 02:10:53.92 He seized my hand with his and as he stared at me with saucer eyes. He squeezed it hard
02:10:54.80 --> 02:10:59.80 As weak as he had been the fear of sailing him now evoked one last birth of strength
02:11:00.40 --> 02:11:05.24 No words came. I held my brother's hand until they pulled me from him door closed
02:11:05.56 --> 02:11:10.20 Driver gunning the engine the humvie lumbered off for fog brimel
02:11:10.20 --> 02:11:15.12 The second one carrying Garvin and Dixon soon followed I watched them go
02:11:15.24 --> 02:11:20.000 Greece and Insabo standing beside me the blood of our brothers drawing on our hands and arms
02:11:22.44 --> 02:11:24.92 So as you guys work we're carrying out
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:29.32 As you guys were carrying out Baldwin you guys got riddled with machine guns
02:11:29.84 --> 02:11:34.12 You then you take one through the pant leg or something. Yeah, I so okay, so
02:11:34.12 --> 02:11:41.000 We were dropping J.Dams on him. We thought we had we thought we had driven the enemy back and given enough
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.32 Tactical space to start e-back on our casualties in a way that we thought was as safe as we could possibly do it
02:11:45.88 --> 02:11:47.88 So how mean you say safe, but you know what I mean?
02:11:48.44 --> 02:11:51.28 It was the best time and so we start picking up
02:11:51.28 --> 02:11:57.88 We rushed Garvin down to the trucks and we come back for Baldwin in the second trip because again Baldwin assisted that we
02:11:57.88 --> 02:12:05.12 That we get Garvin first and so all of us grab Baldwin and Baldwin again six four two fifty huge guys
02:12:05.12 --> 02:12:09.48 So I grab I grab them Sabo grabs them certain Dixon grabs them and Greason grabs them and
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.52 As we're carrying Baldwin to the truck and down the hill we get hit by machine gunfire from a rogue
02:12:15.64 --> 02:12:21.68 You know one of those machine gunnests that wasn't destroyed around went through the back plate of my
02:12:21.96 --> 02:12:24.68 IBA and down through
02:12:24.68 --> 02:12:30.88 Sergeant Dixon's arm as we were carrying them and I just remember watching certain Dixon gets shot right in the forearm and I mean he just
02:12:31.16 --> 02:12:35.12 Then we just watched the blood spurred out of his arm and his face goes
02:12:35.60 --> 02:12:37.60 White and we dropped Baldwin
02:12:38.60 --> 02:12:41.40 It was sort of chaos and then all I remember those is
02:12:41.96 --> 02:12:44.78 Pantoha coming out of nowhere space is still ruined
02:12:45.20 --> 02:12:49.48 throws a turn it could on Dixon and Dixon runs over to the other side of Baldwin and grabs them with his good hand
02:12:49.48 --> 02:12:52.88 And we all pick them up and we get them to the trucks and we get them down to the truck and
02:12:52.88 --> 02:12:56.40 And and Baldwin just kept saying to me over and over again, sir, sir
02:12:56.40 --> 02:12:59.96 And I'm just like it's okay. You're gonna be good. You're gonna be good because he was he was so
02:13:00.40 --> 02:13:06.24 White he had lost so much blood already from the bullet wound to his leg and the thing is is that the bullet
02:13:06.24 --> 02:13:09.24 When to his leg he lost a lot of blood, but he never she was never out of the fight
02:13:09.24 --> 02:13:14.08 He never once stopped shooting and try to get him off the line. It was he was a guy who's a pain in the ass that day
02:13:14.08 --> 02:13:15.88 And I tell him out to this day, you know, I
02:13:16.24 --> 02:13:21.28 Could not get him off the line and he's just ghost white and to this day
02:13:21.28 --> 02:13:26.22 All I remember really a lot about that moment is this this you know around the whites of his teeth
02:13:26.22 --> 02:13:29.40 He's just had this afghan dirt just cake. It was teeth and he just said sir
02:13:29.84 --> 02:13:33.84 You know, I'm really fucked up and I said you're gonna be fine. I promise you're gonna be good
02:13:33.84 --> 02:13:37.12 And I'm like holdin his hand like this and he goes no sir no sir
02:13:37.12 --> 02:13:42.14 I've been shot in the back. I can't feel my legs and then the humvies whisked him away and
02:13:43.24 --> 02:13:48.32 We never really I never saw him again and not until we got bad been back
02:13:48.32 --> 02:13:51.52 Months, you know, we knew he was okay when he was gonna survive
02:13:52.08 --> 02:13:54.96 You got an update on his condition throughout the course of our deployment
02:13:56.32 --> 02:13:58.32 But man that was
02:13:58.32 --> 02:14:01.36 Baldwin was one of those guys in my cartoon that was just a
02:14:02.96 --> 02:14:06.88 Man all my insios were just so great and to lose any one of them like that
02:14:07.36 --> 02:14:09.52 Was really challenging. It was really tough
02:14:10.84 --> 02:14:12.56 You guys got a
02:14:12.56 --> 02:14:18.24 patchies you guys got eight tens and you guys got the B1 when you heard you got the B1 you said the wrath
02:14:18.24 --> 02:14:20.24 of God
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:27.52 Yeah, you know the fact that you know an infantry petune on the border of Afghanistan got a B1 strategic answer capable dropping like
02:14:28.24 --> 02:14:31.52 You know, I don't even know I couldn't even tell you like 20 30 Jdms
02:14:31.52 --> 02:14:35.20 You know Jdms a joint direct attack munition on target
02:14:36.08 --> 02:14:39.20 I mean we I'm telling you we must have at least 11
02:14:39.60 --> 02:14:43.52 Probably more like 22 we dropped over the course of that engagement it was just
02:14:43.52 --> 02:14:49.28 You know because it didn't just end after the enemy broke contact right they were still taking pot shots well after
02:14:49.28 --> 02:14:54.08 With the initial forces broken contact because we had to get a record up there to get our trucks out
02:14:54.08 --> 02:14:59.84 You know get a record up to the top of this mountain together come you guys need to just look forever completely secure this whole
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:05.44 Just took forever it just took forever and we were out there for hours and hours and hours and
02:15:05.44 --> 02:15:11.44 Eventually after we had hooked up our last on V we all limped out of there
02:15:14.88 --> 02:15:17.04 When it was over the silence is almost unbearable
02:15:17.76 --> 02:15:22.56 Galanx force had been pulverized the fighting it lasted almost six hours exhausted
02:15:22.56 --> 02:15:29.04 We hooked up our three disabled rigs and towed them off the hilltop for home our long column traveled west with barely a word shared among us
02:15:29.20 --> 02:15:31.92 empty shell casings littered our humbieve floorboards
02:15:31.92 --> 02:15:37.84 And as we bounced along the rugged afghan roads they jinkled like slabels when we reached Burmel
02:15:38.32 --> 02:15:45.36 The home bodies turned out in force the divide between combat troops and the men who work behind the wire grows wider in moments such as those
02:15:45.84 --> 02:15:50.000 Band of brothers know battle shifts those relationships like nothing else
02:15:50.96 --> 02:15:56.16 We called them pugs which stands for personnel other than grunts or fobits
02:15:56.16 --> 02:16:02.56 They smiled and laughed and took photos of our battered trucks as we parked on our out on the maintenance pad
02:16:03.04 --> 02:16:08.48 They spent the night safe inside the base uniforms clean body armor stowed under their bunks
02:16:12.80 --> 02:16:21.44 And you actually decided to become a smoke right then yes started smoking cigarettes. Yes, I did I did I absolutely did and
02:16:21.44 --> 02:16:27.92 You know I that part of the book. I sort I mean it happened exactly like that you come back
02:16:28.64 --> 02:16:35.12 Your shot to shit you come back and have these guys these guys Americans that greet you and they look at you like you're in like a zoo
02:16:35.52 --> 02:16:38.56 You know they want to see the devastation of the trucks the
02:16:39.20 --> 02:16:45.12 Every single window of our up our our shot out completely. I mean we had we had the up armor ballistic glass
02:16:45.12 --> 02:16:48.16 Thank God for that, but I mean they were all just shot out completely
02:16:48.16 --> 02:16:52.72 I mean almost every single member of my platoon was wounded in that engagement and like
02:16:53.28 --> 02:16:56.80 Guys were bloodied and battered and so you got these guys taking pictures of you that you know
02:16:56.80 --> 02:17:00.08 They're gonna send to their family and be like look at how bad we have it over here
02:17:00.08 --> 02:17:03.44 But these are guys that are like three hawks in a caught every day
02:17:03.52 --> 02:17:06.80 You know they're taking more of showers and then you think about it like this
02:17:07.36 --> 02:17:12.80 You know you get back from from being outside the wire for 10 days and you haven't had a shower in 10 days and there's
02:17:12.80 --> 02:17:17.76 We don't have running water on the base or there's a fine amount of it to begin with you get back and there's nothing but cold showers
02:17:17.76 --> 02:17:22.80 Because these guys stay out the base all the time use all the hot water and you go in any try to call your family and these guys
02:17:22.80 --> 02:17:26.40 We're on the base or clogging up the phones you've been gone for 10 days on a mission
02:17:26.80 --> 02:17:30.32 You can even call your family and then you get out there and all the foods. I mean it was just so I
02:17:31.12 --> 02:17:33.36 I looking back on it now
02:17:33.36 --> 02:17:37.12 I sort of regret that because I don't I I do value
02:17:37.12 --> 02:17:41.20 I mean it does take for every one of us in the field it takes three of them and it's one team one fight
02:17:41.20 --> 02:17:46.40 I believe that to every five with every five of my being but that is how it was at the time we were really pissed
02:17:46.40 --> 02:17:50.96 Well, yeah, you know it's like like when I was talking about that definition of enemy expanding
02:17:51.44 --> 02:17:56.64 Sometimes that definition of enemy can expand inside the inside the wire a little bit and no doubt about and actually
02:17:57.12 --> 02:17:58.16 You know
02:17:58.16 --> 02:18:05.12 You you did an amazing thing and it's at the back of this book you have a letter from a from a guy that was one of the
02:18:05.12 --> 02:18:09.76 Our private a young private is a supply guy who everyone gave him a hard time
02:18:09.76 --> 02:18:15.20 But he was just a good kid great kid. Yeah, and he wrote you a letter and said like because he read the book apparently and
02:18:15.20 --> 02:18:17.92 Said like hey man, I just read this book and you're talking about how
02:18:18.64 --> 02:18:23.04 Harrible we were how horrible the pox were and he explained his story which was
02:18:23.76 --> 02:18:25.76 I think after September 11th he like
02:18:26.24 --> 02:18:28.56 You know was out of shape and
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:35.04 Worked out and trained and gotten shapes so that he could join the army and he took a job that he thought he could be able to handle with that being a supply guy
02:18:35.20 --> 02:18:39.44 And meanwhile the girl that he was in love with who was gonna marry him?
02:18:39.44 --> 02:18:43.04 He went on deployment got extended and she said, you know, I'm not gonna marry you and so he
02:18:43.04 --> 02:18:49.36 Lought but gave up his love of his life and had no future and he's like, hey, I just want you know
02:18:49.36 --> 02:18:58.24 We all sacrifice exactly and you actually what the I thought was awesome you publish that isn't the bag that letters in the back of this book, you know because as you just said
02:18:59.68 --> 02:19:01.68 You know you wrote the way it was
02:19:02.64 --> 02:19:08.72 Then yeah, I'm yeah, right and and man those those things are real and you know it takes
02:19:09.44 --> 02:19:11.84 Both sides right absolutely both sides
02:19:11.84 --> 02:19:13.84 If you're a support person
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.20 You got to remember what the hell the guys in the field are doing and
02:19:18.24 --> 02:19:24.96 If you're in the field you got to remember okay, well, these guys aren't experiencing what we're experiencing so they're they're gonna have a hard time relating to it
02:19:24.96 --> 02:19:26.96 And it's hard to build that bridge
02:19:26.96 --> 02:19:28.96 I mean, honestly with me
02:19:28.96 --> 02:19:37.12 I had 40 seals and I had 60 support people that you know were running all of our stuff and it was pretty easy for me because I saw them all the time
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:40.08 And you know is a much smaller little element and
02:19:40.08 --> 02:19:43.20 But I you know, I told I told my support guys
02:19:43.60 --> 02:19:48.88 The only reason that we're here is to get those guys whatever they need to do their job
02:19:48.88 --> 02:19:53.60 Whatever they need to do their job. We're here. They are our masters
02:19:53.84 --> 02:19:58.08 We are here to support them those two potoons those that's that's who we that's where here
02:19:58.08 --> 02:20:06.08 Absolutely and and the guys got it and that meant you know, I said listen if it means if if you see them eating and they're done with their tray
02:20:06.08 --> 02:20:12.08 You pick up that train you carry it and you put it away form you do that for them so they can spend an extra three seconds
02:20:12.48 --> 02:20:16.16 Prep in their gear for their operation and so the support people
02:20:16.72 --> 02:20:20.32 Understood that because it's real easy for the support people to get isolated and
02:20:20.96 --> 02:20:25.36 They're not going in the field so they're looking at you. Hey, I'm playing a video game tonight
02:20:25.36 --> 02:20:29.04 I don't know what these other guys are doing they don't understand it and so
02:20:29.76 --> 02:20:35.60 They start to have an attitude when someone comes back from being in the field for four days and says hey
02:20:35.60 --> 02:20:41.000 Get let me take a shower and they go who's my turn? No, that's not the right answer the right answer
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.76 It's sorry. Let me go get you some soap. That's the right answer exactly right. I mean that's exactly right
02:20:45.76 --> 02:20:50.64 And I feel like to our first sergeant's credit, you know, he did everything that he could to
02:20:51.36 --> 02:20:54.88 Like treat the operational troops in our base exactly like that
02:20:55.52 --> 02:20:59.68 But as our base grew I mean it was a company size base which made it facilitate
02:21:00.40 --> 02:21:02.96 120 infantrymen and maybe some and and so in the support guys right
02:21:02.96 --> 02:21:07.60 So we probably had 300 people on our base, but as the base grew with our footprint and Afghanistan
02:21:07.60 --> 02:21:11.000 The longer we were there we had units that were there that were not under his you know
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:13.24 Pervue right you want a part of our command
02:21:13.48 --> 02:21:18.08 So you know you have these guys that would like the support personnel that would roll under the showers
02:21:18.08 --> 02:21:22.08 Use all the hot water first starting to be like what are you doing man like you're doing this wrong?
02:21:22.08 --> 02:21:24.64 And they'd be like FU talk to my commander and it's just like well
02:21:25.44 --> 02:21:31.12 You know and it just comes down to like some what battles are worth fighting of what battles aren't you know as an infantry guy
02:21:31.12 --> 02:21:35.84 You know one of the things that you know is like you're net you're rarely gonna get credit for the things that you do
02:21:36.24 --> 02:21:41.92 It's a thankless job and it just sucks and in like the you ever you've heard the term and brace the suck
02:21:41.92 --> 02:21:45.76 Well, this is this is why this is why we get the quest why we wear the blue court
02:21:45.76 --> 02:21:52.80 That's why we get C.I.Bs, you know because our job is harder than everybody else's and I don't mean from a financial standpoint because guess what like
02:21:52.80 --> 02:21:56.48 We're they're getting the same combat painted that we're getting okay, you know
02:21:56.48 --> 02:22:01.44 And and that's sort of the dynamic that we took going forward from that engagement is that like yeah
02:22:01.44 --> 02:22:04.40 Like this this shit sucks. It's gonna get harder, right?
02:22:05.52 --> 02:22:07.52 But we took a sort of like black
02:22:08.08 --> 02:22:11.36 Like a perverse sense of pride out of that and that like
02:22:12.16 --> 02:22:16.000 We were the we ended up being the best unit on our base and because of that
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.80 We were always the forward unit. We were the lead element and every single division level
02:22:20.80 --> 02:22:26.40 Operation and I'm guessing it was my little platoon on the tip of the spear and so we were the ones getting our ass shot up all the time
02:22:26.40 --> 02:22:30.08 So as a leader it would be really easy for me to turn around be like damn it, man
02:22:30.08 --> 02:22:33.76 You know look at all these other pltunes that they're they're in for two and for two and two
02:22:33.92 --> 02:22:38.40 They get to slack off all the time they get to sit on base all the time and look they're not looking their wounds
02:22:38.40 --> 02:22:40.16 They're not getting hurt but at the same time
02:22:40.16 --> 02:22:44.32 I like being the best too and so did my guys so it was just like yeah
02:22:44.32 --> 02:22:48.40 Okay, like yeah, sucks being out here getting shot at all the time getting shot up all the time
02:22:48.40 --> 02:22:52.48 I mean I'm not joking we took 85% casualties eyes guys wounded two and three times
02:22:52.48 --> 02:22:57.36 I had six guys get shot in the head six guys. I also survived every gunner and my platoon was wounded
02:22:57.92 --> 02:23:02.24 Everybody that man the machine gun was wounded and we loved it. I mean it was just I mean we hated it
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:06.16 Right we hated it but like we didn't want anyone else doing that job you hated it
02:23:06.32 --> 02:23:10.88 But you guys were the outlaws that's it that's it man. We we to look
02:23:10.88 --> 02:23:14.08 I'm telling you there were times so I mean I'm telling you my guys would complain
02:23:14.08 --> 02:23:19.44 Sir why don't we got to be the lead element no one likes being the lead element on a division level operation right there
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:23.28 The first year the first year to get blown up shot at every single time
02:23:23.84 --> 02:23:29.44 You know the buck stopped with us. I mean I have my hands. Yeah, God damn it's sir like because if you have an entire battalion
02:23:29.44 --> 02:23:32.96 I'm like 800 plus troops and an infantry battalion operation
02:23:33.28 --> 02:23:38.32 The lead point man and I've got to stand with the I mean the Russian era maps like you make one wrong turn
02:23:38.32 --> 02:23:45.04 Yes, like there's no roads. There's no roads like the entire battalion gets thrown off so I remember my squad that you're Chris County's now a
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:50.16 Swat guy with a Syracuse PD you'd be like sir God damn it can't you just make somebody else appointment
02:23:50.16 --> 02:23:54.08 Just one operation just what so we had to deal with that a lot which is a
02:23:54.72 --> 02:23:59.20 Fun leadership challenge to have but it I always talked to companies about this. You've got it
02:23:59.84 --> 02:24:03.44 You got to be careful that you know in a dynamic and a corporate setting where
02:24:03.44 --> 02:24:10.32 You know the hardest working person because they're the most competent you end up relying on a lot for sure and then the person sitting next to him
02:24:11.36 --> 02:24:19.36 Skates most of the time and so as a leader you really like should identify those things and not put too much on the person that's
02:24:19.92 --> 02:24:24.88 That's moving out and drawn fire every day doing the right thing everyday you got to hold people accountable that aren't doing the right thing
02:24:24.88 --> 02:24:26.40 But at the same time
02:24:26.40 --> 02:24:28.40 We like being yeah and
02:24:28.40 --> 02:24:35.28 You really do as a leader's you protect the guys from the chicken shit stuff that's going on absolutely as much as you can
02:24:35.28 --> 02:24:43.04 And as you guys lost control of that base because other people started moving in that to become became harder and harder to do for sure which is which is a problem
02:24:44.88 --> 02:24:46.88 So
02:24:48.80 --> 02:24:51.04 Going back to the book I've been writing to my dad every chance
02:24:51.04 --> 02:24:54.08 I had most soldiers tell their family none of what happens in combat
02:24:54.08 --> 02:25:00.32 They fear how they were react to the details. I hadn't been doing that my dad had asked and I'd been and never
02:25:00.64 --> 02:25:08.08 Been anything but totally honest with him in the past months the bond between us are grown even deeper as we exchanged emails between patrols by nature
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:11.84 Leaders live a lonely life as close as we can be
02:25:12.32 --> 02:25:18.56 To our men and NCOs there's still an invisible wall that can never be broken down less to lieutenant grow two familiar with his men
02:25:18.80 --> 02:25:20.80 familiarity can breed contempt
02:25:20.80 --> 02:25:26.08 In a fight that could lead to hesitation to follow orders plus a lieutenant who is too emotionally invested in his men
02:25:26.16 --> 02:25:30.000 Might make the wrong decision in combat in trying to spare their lives
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.76 He could actually make the mistake that ends up getting them all killed
02:25:34.48 --> 02:25:39.76 My dad's emails and our few phone conversations had bombed some of the tenth sense of isolation
02:25:39.76 --> 02:25:45.60 I've been feeling I pulled up his email address. I wouldn't write him about lieutenant Taylor and what he had said
02:25:45.60 --> 02:25:50.16 That's sort of company business needed to stay within the company at least for now
02:25:51.52 --> 02:25:57.84 Right then a bolt of home sickness left me almost breathless words began pouring out dad
02:25:58.24 --> 02:26:01.04 The enemy men business and didn't stop coming
02:26:01.28 --> 02:26:06.16 It was like the Russian hoard eventually we were going to run out of ammo and they were going to overrun us
02:26:06.16 --> 02:26:11.28 I'm a damn platoon leader and I had one magazine left when our QRF quick reaction force arrived
02:26:11.28 --> 02:26:17.60 We killed tons of them and they just kept coming wave after wave half of my platoon will get purple hearts
02:26:17.60 --> 02:26:20.88 My sharp nooons are healing fast my headache is going away
02:26:21.36 --> 02:26:25.28 But I still can't hear out of my right ear and the ringing is annoying is hell
02:26:27.20 --> 02:26:30.64 I paused and re-read the words as a soldier and a leader
02:26:30.64 --> 02:26:33.12 I cannot complain or show weakness to anyone
02:26:33.52 --> 02:26:37.92 Such a revelation here would destroy my ability to command and battle and ruin the hard
02:26:38.48 --> 02:26:40.48 Hard one respect I'd earn from the men
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:42.48 Leadership exists on a knife edge
02:26:43.60 --> 02:26:49.20 Any sign of hesitation doubt or inability to hack it would have pushed me out of the platoon's inner circle
02:26:50.24 --> 02:26:54.48 I could deal with getting shot at I could deal with the threat of capture and be heading wall
02:26:55.52 --> 02:26:57.52 My empty m4 lay at my side
02:26:57.52 --> 02:27:03.36 I could deal with the pain in my head the vertical the sleepest nights where the buzzing in my ears kept me company
02:27:03.36 --> 02:27:07.12 But one thing I could not deal with was being pushed out
02:27:07.12 --> 02:27:13.84 Sean the leader had to be tough Sean the man needed to unburden himself as I started typing again
02:27:13.84 --> 02:27:19.04 I realized that just by reading my words my father was performing a noble and selfless service for me
02:27:19.36 --> 02:27:26.64 Somewhere on the other side of the world somebody I love knew what I was going through and he was standing strong for me
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:31.28 I mean
02:27:31.28 --> 02:27:33.28 I feel like that was a
02:27:33.28 --> 02:27:38.32 I feel like I needed in the moment, but I I hear it again today and I feel like and I know now
02:27:39.44 --> 02:27:43.92 You know what my dad went through and now you know I know why guys going talk about it
02:27:43.92 --> 02:27:48.56 You know what I mean? I was stupid. I shouldn't have I should have never done it and almost it almost
02:27:49.12 --> 02:27:53.44 I want to say it like it's destroyed my father. That's that's a bit much, but it
02:27:54.08 --> 02:27:55.92 It took a serious serious
02:27:55.92 --> 02:28:00.80 serious toll on him to where I didn't know this the that this dynamic until I got home, but
02:28:00.80 --> 02:28:08.24 My mom was just she was the rock of my family. They kept it all together. I mean this deployment was just
02:28:08.80 --> 02:28:12.80 It was so hard on my family and I was exacerbated by
02:28:13.84 --> 02:28:17.60 These stupid emails. I'd send to my dad, but I just felt you know
02:28:18.96 --> 02:28:21.60 Although I was the only lieutenant that made it through the entire deployment
02:28:21.60 --> 02:28:25.84 I was the only officer that made it through the entire deployment of my entire company that either guys either
02:28:25.84 --> 02:28:32.16 moved out to a different duty assignment or we wounded. I mean I was a butoon later with my men for 33 months
02:28:32.16 --> 02:28:38.88 But just unheard of in the army like a second lieutenant takes up a tune for 12 months to 18 months tops. I was there for 33 months and so
02:28:41.36 --> 02:28:45.52 When shit started hitting the fan real bad my baton commander's like we got to keep our leadership in place
02:28:45.84 --> 02:28:49.12 You know, but so because of that dynamic
02:28:49.68 --> 02:28:54.96 Right or wrong and I I largely think it was a really it was a piss poor decision now thinking and thinking back on it
02:28:54.96 --> 02:29:01.12 But I was lonely man not to sound like I didn't have anybody to talk to I didn't I didn't have the kind of relationship with my company commander
02:29:01.12 --> 02:29:06.56 Where I can go and vent to him. You know, I just didn't he was he had been there for a couple months and he was a great guy
02:29:06.56 --> 02:29:08.56 But we just didn't have that kind of relationship
02:29:09.12 --> 02:29:12.32 And I'm sure as hell wasn't getting ripe to my poutine sergeant or down
02:29:12.32 --> 02:29:17.36 And I didn't really have any contemporaries either because they were wounded and being moved out or moved around you know
02:29:17.36 --> 02:29:19.36 A moved around the battalion
02:29:19.36 --> 02:29:24.24 In fact, I mean actually it was more like I think we had a lieutenant go home because he had a real sickness in his family
02:29:24.24 --> 02:29:29.92 Like his father got sick and was in the hospital three of the leaves so that platoon was being run by an NCO and the other one was wounded
02:29:29.92 --> 02:29:34.40 It was just like I didn't have anybody to talk to so I was talking to my dad and it was a mistake
02:29:34.40 --> 02:29:38.88 I mean it was I mean if I if I had a mall again on that one I would not have done that
02:29:39.52 --> 02:29:43.28 So you were given him pretty much detailed ob sums of everything that was going on
02:29:43.76 --> 02:29:47.36 Not you know that like unclassified version. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I would just be like
02:29:48.64 --> 02:29:52.64 Sort of I mean I think yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I still I mean that's the actual email
02:29:52.64 --> 02:29:54.64 I sent him you know
02:29:55.36 --> 02:30:01.04 And I think I sort of dialed it back in the military doll my dad went to the naval academy and stayed until he was a sophomore
02:30:01.60 --> 02:30:07.98 But then left after that and I got what year what like what year to the first it was the first year that it allowed
02:30:07.98 --> 02:30:12.16 Females so I don't remember what that was I think you would say it was like 1978 or something
02:30:12.16 --> 02:30:15.20 Okay, that was his that was his pleb year in the naval academy, but I
02:30:15.76 --> 02:30:20.68 Mean I don't come from a military family. Yeah, you know, I'm like but your dad at least had the understanding
02:30:20.68 --> 02:30:27.28 It wasn't I should say on your dad at least your dad understood like a the military bra. Oh
02:30:27.56 --> 02:30:32.52 100% yeah, and I think that he knew the role that he was fulfilling, but I think that it was slowly destroying him
02:30:33.04 --> 02:30:36.40 I mean because I remember there were times we'd go on missions and there was this
02:30:37.12 --> 02:30:42.16 We lost an entire battalion staff and 371 cavalry Colonel Fenty of an
02:30:42.36 --> 02:30:45.64 O5 went down with his battalion staff and this was before
02:30:45.64 --> 02:30:53.12 My first firefight in May, but my first firefight overlapped with that so we were outside the wire
02:30:53.92 --> 02:30:55.92 for 10 to 11 days and
02:30:57.16 --> 02:31:02.80 Backstate side it was like all they were getting on the ticker was CH 40 helicopter crash goes down
02:31:03.56 --> 02:31:10.44 20 troops from the 10th mountain are dead in eastern Afghanistan and so my parents were just like
02:31:10.44 --> 02:31:17.16 Be side themselves. I mean, I can't imagine what they went through for that knit and then part of this was this all this
02:31:17.56 --> 02:31:22.40 Well, I wish they would have I would have just let them live in the matrix if that makes sense like just let them like
02:31:23.56 --> 02:31:29.04 This is why troops don't talk to their families when they're in combat. This is why they don't tell them the details of the operation
02:31:29.04 --> 02:31:30.64 ultimately is because
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:32.04 They I think
02:31:32.04 --> 02:31:36.68 Maybe they know this maybe it's conscious. Maybe it's not but it it this this type of shit
02:31:36.68 --> 02:31:43.06 Can't really destroy someone who loves you deeply, you know, and I'm telling you I know it's not I
02:31:43.56 --> 02:31:47.000 It's like one of those things. I really wish I would have done differently. You know
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000 Yeah, that's
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000 That may sound harsh
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:59.92 But I agree 100% and I never told anyone my wife anything if anything that was going on ever now
02:32:00.20 --> 02:32:03.48 You know it's hard like for my wife because I'm like telling her nothing
02:32:03.48 --> 02:32:07.28 But then like my guys are coming home. We'll get her my guy. She's going to my guys funeral, so that's
02:32:07.80 --> 02:32:09.80 Like the reality
02:32:09.80 --> 02:32:17.72 But even then it was I was just I didn't tell her anything my parents same thing. I didn't tell them anything because for this very reason
02:32:18.44 --> 02:32:22.76 I can't it seemed like it would be bird too too much of a burden. It is I mean
02:32:22.76 --> 02:32:26.28 It was a huge mistake. I mean now though now that I'm out
02:32:26.28 --> 02:32:29.24 I do think it's incredibly important for people to know
02:32:29.24 --> 02:32:35.20 What our men and women go through but when you're there and people are you know
02:32:35.20 --> 02:32:37.96 It was like so we had a LL Insta messenger back then and
02:32:38.96 --> 02:32:43.12 You know, that's how we would communicate with home and like my dad
02:32:43.12 --> 02:32:46.72 He would tell me later that he would sit there and he would turn on the
02:32:47.48 --> 02:32:53.56 A-O-L Insta messenger chime because he and that you know how you would like go idle and your net your user name would get
02:32:53.56 --> 02:32:57.52 He would stare at the computer turn the volume up on the computers all around the house to the one
02:32:57.52 --> 02:33:02.84 Insta mess yes, and so the A-O-L Insta messenger chime became almost like
02:33:03.64 --> 02:33:06.64 You know angel bells to him and
02:33:06.64 --> 02:33:11.04 Like to think about what that experience was like for him on a day-to-day basis
02:33:11.36 --> 02:33:16.88 And then him having to be a father to my sister and two younger brothers and a husband and work
02:33:16.88 --> 02:33:18.88 I don't know how we could have done it
02:33:21.32 --> 02:33:23.32 Check
02:33:23.32 --> 02:33:30.44 Going back to the book the special forces lieutenant Colonel regarded me with skepticism behind us
02:33:30.44 --> 02:33:36.96 The rest of his team huddled around the laptop silences on their weapon cool guy gear dangling from their chest rigs before we left Burmel
02:33:36.96 --> 02:33:44.08 I wanted to tell them that all this all that stuff would just slow them down where we were going no matter how fit a soldier is at
02:33:44.08 --> 02:33:49.68 10,000 feet the only thing you can afford to carry is water ammo in your weapon everything else just drags you down
02:33:49.68 --> 02:33:58.48 So that was them that was the May 7 fight I concluded I've been instructed to give the special forces team a brief on my on the combat
02:33:58.48 --> 02:34:04.52 My opportunity to experience I started to explain June 10 for the lieutenant Colonel's look of disbelief solidified
02:34:04.52 --> 02:34:12.32 I concealed my frustration and continued to brief the special operators have been pushed over pushed down to Burmel to get a better feel for the amount of enemy
02:34:12.32 --> 02:34:18.52 Activity captain died asked me to take them out on patrol with us for a next few cycles something I was not looking forward to doing
02:34:18.52 --> 02:34:24.48 We had some friction with the other special forces teams in our area and as a result my men did not hold them in high regard
02:34:24.88 --> 02:34:33.64 There were attitude differences between us regular line infantry and the SF guys and I'd come to regard any liaison effort with them as a
02:34:33.64 --> 02:34:35.64 Ponderous and difficult task
02:34:36.04 --> 02:34:43.04 The ones we had encountered seemed all to have the elite attitude without the tactical acumen needed to keep them alive all in patrol
02:34:43.04 --> 02:34:48.28 Rather than focusing on the enemy they seem to go they seem to us to be preoccupied with frivolous and
02:34:48.44 --> 02:34:51.32 extraneous details such as what color they should paint their weapons
02:34:51.76 --> 02:34:56.68 We also didn't think much of them and they're refusal to wear protective gear such as helmets
02:34:56.96 --> 02:35:04.72 Most of the time they walked around nonchalantly in baseball caps after what we'd gone through that sort of theatrical stuff came across as sheer stupidity
02:35:05.60 --> 02:35:11.04 So you're gonna take these SF guys out and I actually I really like Captain dies decision of like
02:35:11.04 --> 02:35:14.32 Oh, you want to go and some trolls my guys cool. I'll see if you guys
02:35:15.12 --> 02:35:21.68 Yeah, look I mean it was frustrating. I mean just from an operational standpoint some of the SF teams because they would rotate in and out of skin the base
02:35:21.68 --> 02:35:29.000 And that was just like a really bad area, you know, and then we're talking 10 feet from a
02:35:30.12 --> 02:35:33.12 Packest any mill a pack mill check point. I mean they were really right on the border
02:35:33.84 --> 02:35:37.36 But some of the SF teams were great. They shared in tell great
02:35:37.36 --> 02:35:43.76 They would tell us when they were in our area of operations. I mean these are these are baseline things that I feel like if you're a commander
02:35:43.76 --> 02:35:48.44 And you're in a battle space and you're calling for fire and you don't know an SF team is out there somebody could die
02:35:48.44 --> 02:35:54.08 Oh, yeah, I can't tell you how many times we'd have SF teams rolling around with quads and shit in our area of operations
02:35:54.08 --> 02:35:58.44 We're like dude, what are you guys doing or new SF teams would roll in and we'd go down and brief them right?
02:35:58.44 --> 02:36:01.30 And I'm just some stupid infantry lieutenant, but I'd been through some shit
02:36:01.30 --> 02:36:04.92 And I knew I knew the area that we were fighting in really well and it'd be talking to these guys
02:36:04.92 --> 02:36:08.60 And it's almost like they didn't believe how terrible it was and
02:36:09.88 --> 02:36:12.68 I can I can count on one hand
02:36:12.68 --> 02:36:20.20 I'm probably four or five times at least where we had to go out and bail out an SF team because they'd roll outside the wire with four dudes
02:36:20.20 --> 02:36:24.60 And a pickup truck with a teeny penalty saw on the back of their pickup trip
02:36:24.60 --> 02:36:27.000 I mean look like something out of Star Wars. It looked really cool
02:36:27.32 --> 02:36:30.44 But we would tell them like man like if you're gonna be in a turret you gotta wear your helmet
02:36:30.44 --> 02:36:37.40 You can't go out there with your New York Yankees baseball hat on like I know that looks cool, but that's not you you really need to listen to what we're saying
02:36:37.40 --> 02:36:42.28 And I feel like some of them really paid the price. I mean they I know for a fact that
02:36:42.76 --> 02:36:49.48 We had they they were overrun in a couple different situations and I guess we just at that point in time and they deployment over over time
02:36:49.48 --> 02:36:52.68 It's just got annoying going out and bail them out all the time. You know
02:36:54.16 --> 02:36:58.52 SF teams have you know, they're small four-internal defense is their mission
02:36:58.52 --> 02:37:03.16 They're they work with indigenous populists. They don't have the combat power of a traditional infantry battalion
02:37:03.80 --> 02:37:06.52 And again some of them are great some of them not so much
02:37:06.84 --> 02:37:13.08 And my men didn't really hold them in high regard just because they were very dismissive of the stuff that they had experienced and so
02:37:13.64 --> 02:37:17.72 Captain I was like yeah, take this SF kernel out with you and of course as I'm like damn it
02:37:17.72 --> 02:37:22.52 You know no one likes to babysit anybody on a combat patrol especially if they're not trained with your guys
02:37:22.92 --> 02:37:25.56 You know, I know his name use this like this one
02:37:25.56 --> 02:37:29.000 This specific lieutenant kernel was
02:37:30.20 --> 02:37:35.80 He was just a single 10 guy like he was just a single-taired some he had a team with him, but he was a single 10 guy
02:37:35.80 --> 02:37:37.80 We go outside the wire on his own
02:37:38.04 --> 02:37:44.84 We took him outside the wire and we just got lit up and he was just he just couldn't believe it. He was like
02:37:45.48 --> 02:37:49.96 This is the greatest shit I've experienced this Columbia and I'm like all right sir calm down
02:37:49.96 --> 02:37:54.76 Let's like let's let you know like let's he's like what we can do what we can do we can counter attack
02:37:54.76 --> 02:37:58.28 We need to take the fight on my co-case or yeah, we're gonna do that but like just calm down first
02:37:58.28 --> 02:38:02.52 I mean he was so into it and at the end of that engagement he was just like
02:38:03.64 --> 02:38:09.08 He was that he was a believer man. He was like I cannot believe the shit that you guys are in down here all the time
02:38:09.08 --> 02:38:12.84 I you know, I've got to go back and I've got to tell General Freyclie about this user
02:38:12.84 --> 02:38:18.60 Did the 10-mount division commander at the time he was like I got to tell him about this I got to tell him I'm like
02:38:18.60 --> 02:38:25.000 Yeah, yeah, we're I'm like I told you in and you're in and my briefing to you like it's it's no joke around here
02:38:25.32 --> 02:38:27.32 Yeah, that's
02:38:27.96 --> 02:38:29.000 We we we
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.76 We had a great relationship with all the conventional forces that we worked alongside we pretty much acted as close
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:37.16 We could do acting like them, you know, we all
02:38:37.80 --> 02:38:39.96 Or the same uniforms is them we
02:38:40.44 --> 02:38:46.12 All had the same grooming standards is them. We yeah, that's what we did and we never we never got an opportunity
02:38:46.12 --> 02:38:52.44 Work with seals and each and a half can of Stan yeah, yeah, I mean who knows what the what the layout of the guys were at the time?
02:38:52.44 --> 02:38:58.36 But I my point is we had guys army guys and Marines
02:38:58.92 --> 02:39:02.84 Primarily army that had definitely we had to overcome a
02:39:03.48 --> 02:39:09.08 Pregnitist against special operations because they had had real bad kind of experiences that you're talking about in there and again like you said
02:39:09.08 --> 02:39:10.44 You know what there's great
02:39:10.44 --> 02:39:13.80 SF teams there's there's great seal teams there's horrible ones
02:39:13.80 --> 02:39:18.84 Just like there's great infantry battalions and great infantry companies and there's shady ones as well
02:39:18.84 --> 02:39:25.32 Absolutely kind of you you kind of just have to you have to look at what you're dealing with but my point is
02:39:26.28 --> 02:39:31.32 If you're out there be one of the good ones be someone that's gonna listen you know when we got to Ramadi
02:39:31.32 --> 02:39:35.32 There was a it was a national guard unit on the ground out of Pennsylvania the 2 to 8
02:39:35.32 --> 02:39:37.32 I remember it was
02:39:37.32 --> 02:39:43.88 Guy then went to ROTC was a 2-liter yeah, well, we probably worked with them. Yes, yeah when we showed up there
02:39:43.88 --> 02:39:45.88 Those guys were freaking awesome
02:39:45.88 --> 02:39:51.32 They had been there for like a year or 14 months or something like that and we went in with hey
02:39:51.88 --> 02:39:57.16 What do you want to tell us how can we learn from you that was a rat exact right attitude? Yeah, I mean I
02:39:57.72 --> 02:40:04.20 That's the I mean again humility you go in big eyes big ears humble self-effacing listen
02:40:04.20 --> 02:40:10.68 You know and what what I I remember telling specifically one special forces commander when I was down there who we had a great
02:40:10.68 --> 02:40:14.12 Relationship with because he sort of came into it with that attitude and I'm just like you know
02:40:15.24 --> 02:40:20.20 You guys are awesome. You know, I know you guys have got some serious hardcore cool guy training
02:40:20.20 --> 02:40:24.84 You know, but a bullet kills you just the same is gonna kill me man, you know and so
02:40:25.96 --> 02:40:27.40 It a very minimum
02:40:27.40 --> 02:40:33.000 Listen to some of the intel that I got that that may help you get your people out of here alive
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:40.28 Right and you got your own TTPs you operate your own way, but there are things very specifically that you need to do here in this area of
02:40:40.28 --> 02:40:44.44 Operations that will give you a much better chance of surviving and he listened and
02:40:45.32 --> 02:40:51.16 And we had a great relationship because of that we shared intel and I mean that was a great combat multiplier for us because
02:40:51.72 --> 02:40:56.04 You know, we knew where the high value targets were I mean as a conventional infantry guy like
02:40:56.52 --> 02:40:59.24 You know, I mean we were getting the big kinetic fights and stuff
02:40:59.24 --> 02:41:04.20 But it's really not our job to go out unless we're doing an outer court on it's not our job to go after high value targets
02:41:04.20 --> 02:41:07.16 And if we get too close to him we could spook him and they could make it leave so
02:41:07.40 --> 02:41:12.80 These are these are I'm I share these things for for the listeners reason this is why Intel sharing to a certain extent
02:41:12.80 --> 02:41:15.96 This really important. It's really important. Yeah, exactly
02:41:16.92 --> 02:41:23.98 So another thing that happened with that special forces kernel is he actually they had some intel for you and you talked about earlier
02:41:23.98 --> 02:41:27.40 about I'm gonna I'm gonna cover real quick anyways because it's
02:41:27.40 --> 02:41:33.32 He gave you the intel and then here's you briefing the guys going back to the book we know the enemies intentions now
02:41:33.32 --> 02:41:35.56 I said that got everyone's attention
02:41:36.36 --> 02:41:40.28 They are seeking a decisive victory over an American platoon
02:41:40.44 --> 02:41:45.92 They want to pin us in a kill zone by disabling our vehicles then overrun us and kill us to the last man
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:51.08 They plan to be head anyone they capture if they catch us in an observation point again
02:41:51.08 --> 02:41:54.80 They will try to direct a salt just like do June 10
02:41:54.80 --> 02:41:59.20 Sabo Groud guess we'll ratchet things up
02:42:00.68 --> 02:42:04.84 So that's what that's what you've been contending with this whole time. Yes, and it's real clear
02:42:04.84 --> 02:42:09.80 Looking in the rearview mirror obviously that's what they were trying to do. Yeah, right?
02:42:09.80 --> 02:42:16.24 I mean, I was watching you read that and you smile when you say this as ratchet things up because I feel like that
02:42:16.64 --> 02:42:21.72 That phrase like everything about you is ratchet things up like default aggressive
02:42:21.72 --> 02:42:28.40 Default aggressive, but yeah, I mean we I mean when we heard that intel from that special forces
02:42:29.16 --> 02:42:34.84 Lieutenant Colonel and I still remember him by name, but I'm not gonna say it because he's I think he's still active, but
02:42:36.48 --> 02:42:38.84 I mean, okay, so you know they're trying to kill you
02:42:38.84 --> 02:42:45.72 But what you know what their mission is every time they attack you they want to overrun you and cut off your heads and
02:42:45.72 --> 02:42:53.12 Put them on stakes and we heard them say it over and over again on this this this this Colonel gave us radio
02:42:53.12 --> 02:42:57.80 That is listen to the recordings. I mean we heard them say it and then and then and then after a while
02:42:57.80 --> 02:43:05.88 We'd see these DVD videos trickle down to our base of attacks where they did just that in our AO of other coalition troops
02:43:05.88 --> 02:43:08.88 Meaning like you know other Afghan national troops out there
02:43:09.88 --> 02:43:15.000 It starts to hit pretty close to home and we thought the war was personal when we lost
02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:20.24 I've told now it really was you know, I mean war life death issues are always
02:43:20.80 --> 02:43:26.46 Intimately personal, but there's something about knowing the enemy's mission and knowing what they want to do and
02:43:26.76 --> 02:43:34.20 Knowing how they want to do it that just it can rattle you a little bit. I mean I feel like to this day the idea of
02:43:34.96 --> 02:43:40.52 I mean look if you've ever seen those videos of America. I mean sure you had their terrifying. I mean
02:43:40.52 --> 02:43:46.12 That it's you know the idea of getting beheaded with like a butter knife is not something that like
02:43:46.68 --> 02:43:48.68 You know it's a scary way to go
02:43:48.92 --> 02:43:54.88 Yeah, and as far as I'm concerned and as far as I was concerned that was absolutely the goal of everyone
02:43:54.88 --> 02:43:59.80 I ever just looked at on the battlefield like that's and you know when you I don't know if you did you do
02:43:59.80 --> 02:44:03.40 Did you guys capture a lot of bad guys? We did we captured a few of them
02:44:03.40 --> 02:44:07.36 We would just give we talked to them and get the intel that we could and we give them to the A and A like
02:44:07.36 --> 02:44:13.44 Sometimes we would capture a bad guy and actually echo is asking me about this earlier taste like what what are they like and
02:44:14.32 --> 02:44:15.60 Some of them
02:44:15.60 --> 02:44:20.60 They had a look in their eyes like you know 100% that if the tables were turned
02:44:20.60 --> 02:44:25.56 They would 100% be selling off your head no doubt about it. You can see it in their eyes
02:44:26.20 --> 02:44:28.20 They're just black with hate
02:44:28.20 --> 02:44:31.72 I don't know where that hate comes from a lifetime of indoctrination
02:44:31.72 --> 02:44:38.000 But that you just see something in their eyes where you know that they would if the tables were turned
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:41.000 They would absolutely cut your head off no question about it
02:44:41.40 --> 02:44:45.80 So I kind of always thought that that's what what would happen
02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:51.48 You guys so that had a little I guess we'll say a psychological
02:44:52.44 --> 02:44:57.96 Impact on you guys now knowing this 100% but there was nothing more evident of a
02:44:57.96 --> 02:45:01.56 I'll call it a negative psychological impact
02:45:02.04 --> 02:45:11.04 Then a you guys were on a little outpost and you guys get hit with a massive rocket attack and you guys are completely pinned down
02:45:11.40 --> 02:45:19.36 You're taking rocket after rocket after rocket after rocket after rocket after rocket and finally you get the call in to Captain die
02:45:20.52 --> 02:45:24.62 And you know you want in direct fire you want to put this stuff this problem out and
02:45:24.62 --> 02:45:28.06 And he comes back on the radio and says negative three six
02:45:28.78 --> 02:45:35.66 That's Pakistan territory another rocket skittered past low and fast everyone molded himself against the Haskell bag wall
02:45:35.90 --> 02:45:41.98 As it spewed shrapnel and flame across the outpost the explosion sent peels of terror through us
02:45:42.78 --> 02:45:44.78 We can't shoot back
02:45:46.42 --> 02:45:48.66 All we could do is lie there captives
02:45:48.66 --> 02:45:56.06 I saw the platoon change the men's eyes grew hollowed and wide we'd been through dangerous encounters before
02:45:56.06 --> 02:45:58.66 But we'd always been able to fight back
02:45:59.22 --> 02:46:06.94 That gave us something to do and occupied our minds our inability to act now exposed us to terrors fullest effects
02:46:09.50 --> 02:46:14.86 A platoon's morale is an elastic quality from its baseline events
02:46:14.86 --> 02:46:19.66 Effecting the men can cause it to bend in different directions male gives it a boost
02:46:19.90 --> 02:46:28.10 So does hot chow after a long day a small gesture by a first sergeant showing that he has the well-being of the men in mind can also go a long way a
02:46:28.46 --> 02:46:31.06 Victory in combat can bring a euphoria a
02:46:31.78 --> 02:46:34.26 defeat will bring despair and doubt
02:46:34.26 --> 02:46:43.66 We'd seen or experienced the gamut and the men had always returned to their baseline laughing a river and selves after a little while it was our natural state
02:46:44.70 --> 02:46:46.94 But something happened under those rockets
02:46:47.46 --> 02:46:53.62 We'd never felt so utterly helpless being unable to fight back had stripped us of our aggressive spirit
02:46:53.62 --> 02:46:59.78 It had left us feeling impenant mere observers of death and destruction thrown our way
02:46:59.78 --> 02:47:04.86 That's I mean to me I feel like that's the
02:47:05.62 --> 02:47:09.22 The opposite of default aggressive right I mean that's like
02:47:10.14 --> 02:47:18.86 There's nothing worse than being on the receiving end of indirect fire and not have the ability to you don't have the ability to do anything about it, you know
02:47:19.94 --> 02:47:23.70 This particular engagement happened at fob schgan at the alamo, which is
02:47:23.70 --> 02:47:30.02 You look at me just stones throw away from a pack mill checkpoint that is that is you know
02:47:30.02 --> 02:47:34.38 They were probably two or three discas pointed right at the alamo this basically this
02:47:34.98 --> 02:47:41.30 Colot you know with four guard towers around it you're you know the pack mill have
02:47:42.10 --> 02:47:45.82 They're on the high ground all around you right looking right down into your base and
02:47:47.14 --> 02:47:50.82 The Taliban whoever's firing indirect out of that they were using
02:47:50.82 --> 02:47:55.10 Incorporating with the pack mill using them as shields knowing that
02:47:55.90 --> 02:48:01.82 We wouldn't be able to shoot back, you know, so this is a new evolving threat the first time that we had faced it
02:48:01.94 --> 02:48:07.34 What they were trying to do is get us to open up on a pack mill checkpoint cost some international incident
02:48:08.26 --> 02:48:12.18 It'd be all over the news in America. We'd get blamed for it, you know
02:48:12.18 --> 02:48:16.14 The Taliban al Qaeda whoever conducted attack you'd never hear mention of them and
02:48:16.14 --> 02:48:18.14 And
02:48:18.50 --> 02:48:23.34 We were spread out from our trucks and the indirect was so heavy that we couldn't get back to them and so
02:48:23.82 --> 02:48:27.90 God man, you just you never feel as so helpless then you're just sitting there
02:48:28.30 --> 02:48:30.94 You know, tucked up against the hasco wall and
02:48:31.50 --> 02:48:33.90 Just hoping that a rocket doesn't land on your head
02:48:34.30 --> 02:48:38.30 There's nothing that you can do about it, but just like let go, you know
02:48:39.10 --> 02:48:44.34 Was this directory the rockets there was coming flat traffic from a trajectory like high to low
02:48:44.34 --> 02:48:50.82 There would be a shot from an elevated position right into us, but it was direct fire. There was direct fire. Yeah, no question and so
02:48:51.30 --> 02:48:56.34 One of the rockets hit an a and a guard tower like a wooden guard tower just blew it to smithereens
02:48:56.34 --> 02:49:01.50 Which is right by the exit so the the base was just basically it was a square with a square
02:49:01.82 --> 02:49:04.50 Colot on the inside our trucks were lined up in a row
02:49:05.34 --> 02:49:09.94 Right next to the compound and they were just taking a trap and we were spread out all over the base
02:49:09.94 --> 02:49:12.46 We couldn't even get back to our trucks to X-Fell
02:49:12.46 --> 02:49:18.86 And I think we fired a couple 60 millimeter mortars in the handheld just to make them think that we were shooting back
02:49:20.54 --> 02:49:26.26 Eventually after a while after about an hour of that. I mean, God man the longest hour of your life
02:49:26.26 --> 02:49:29.26 How in hour in hour we got an Apache
02:49:29.62 --> 02:49:34.38 We got an Apache to come down and just do a show of force, but we couldn't we couldn't engage with it
02:49:34.46 --> 02:49:38.38 So when the Apache got down and did the show of force
02:49:39.34 --> 02:49:41.34 It bought us enough time
02:49:41.34 --> 02:49:46.62 To run to our trucks and get the hell out of Dodge and I remember rolling back into the base man
02:49:46.62 --> 02:49:49.98 I'm telling you it was just I mean, God, it's like
02:49:50.54 --> 02:49:55.02 It's sinking feeling in your heart that it's only a matter of time
02:49:55.82 --> 02:49:57.82 And I remember walking
02:49:57.82 --> 02:50:07.14 Back into my hooch and the mail was there and it was on my desk and I remember opening up this little letter from my cousin Freddy and he had drawn this American soldier with a flag
02:50:07.14 --> 02:50:09.98 It was the fourth-inch of light and I didn't even realize it, you know
02:50:09.98 --> 02:50:15.58 And I just sat there and I looked at it and I thought of it and I thought of like home
02:50:15.58 --> 02:50:20.38 And I missed home and I thought of Steelers and I thought I'd go into pirate's games and a big Pittsburgh sports fan and
02:50:21.10 --> 02:50:27.02 All the things that reminded me of home like hand burgers hot dogs whatever, you know beer
02:50:27.98 --> 02:50:32.06 Music and I just thought to myself like you know if it's only a matter of time
02:50:32.46 --> 02:50:34.46 Like I can't out-allow myself to
02:50:35.42 --> 02:50:37.42 Think of any of this stuff anymore
02:50:37.42 --> 02:50:40.86 No, I basically it's in order to survive and
02:50:41.50 --> 02:50:47.02 Environment where your day-to-day life is it's only a matter of time
02:50:48.38 --> 02:50:54.14 Hope can be a cost-acquality in combat, you know hope leads to fear and
02:50:54.62 --> 02:51:01.50 That fear can lead to hesitation on the battlefield or not doing what needs to be done at the moment it needs to be done and when that happens
02:51:03.34 --> 02:51:05.34 Men die and so
02:51:05.34 --> 02:51:14.14 I remember very very distinctly folding up that picture instead of hanging on my wall folding up that picture and putting it in my foot locker
02:51:14.54 --> 02:51:18.78 And just just you know keeping it there if I made it home great I'd have it for later
02:51:18.78 --> 02:51:23.66 But if not I could not allow myself to think back to those fleeting moments of home
02:51:24.22 --> 02:51:26.22 I just had basically just give up hope
02:51:26.22 --> 02:51:33.02 Yeah, I've ever make it home. It's a weird way to live, man, but with the only thing that you're worried about is living or dying once you flip that switch
02:51:33.02 --> 02:51:37.90 It's a hard one to it's a hard one to turn back on my wife when I was in
02:51:38.30 --> 02:51:44.22 Remodied my wife sent me an email and said hey the kids want to see a picture of you know where you sleep at night and I was like okay
02:51:44.22 --> 02:51:50.78 You know I had in this old Saddam regime building. I had a room and it had a plywood whatever bed and
02:51:51.58 --> 02:51:55.02 Part of the plywood bed was you know sticking up almost like a headboard
02:51:55.02 --> 02:51:59.66 So anyways, I was just gonna take a picture of it and I looked at it and it was just completely empty and I
02:51:59.66 --> 02:52:08.22 We said oh this not good so I took open the drawer took out a folder took a picture of my wife and kids and hung them up
02:52:08.62 --> 02:52:10.62 Took a picture of my bed with those pictures in it
02:52:11.50 --> 02:52:18.54 Took the pictures down put them back in the folder and put them back in the drawer like same exact thoughts that you had like there are just
02:52:19.02 --> 02:52:21.26 way too many decisions that need to be made
02:52:22.14 --> 02:52:24.14 That the last thing I need to be thinking about
02:52:24.14 --> 02:52:30.78 Is my wife and family back home and the only thing I need to be thinking about is these guys on the ground with me
02:52:31.10 --> 02:52:32.78 100% and
02:52:32.78 --> 02:52:34.78 It's because I feel like if you start
02:52:35.66 --> 02:52:41.42 Longing for home and you start missing those things it did distract you from the mission that needs to be done
02:52:41.42 --> 02:52:47.66 I got and when I saw guys get in that mindset when I saw my guys starting to you know
02:52:47.66 --> 02:52:54.30 Stare at the pictures of home that made me super nervous, you know, and I would like do things that you know maybe trying pull them off
02:52:54.46 --> 02:53:01.90 Let them you know get some you know some time back in camp or whatever trying get them to get over that because I
02:53:02.38 --> 02:53:06.94 Totally agree if you're if that's what's in the front of your mind. That's not gonna be good for you
02:53:07.90 --> 02:53:15.26 And it's it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna inhibit your default aggressive attitude and then all those things that we talked about the positives of being
02:53:15.26 --> 02:53:21.90 Default aggressive are all gonna disappear. Can I gonna be default hesitant? Well, yeah default hesitant default defensive and that case
02:53:21.90 --> 02:53:26.94 You see in in that specific chapter how costic and destructive
02:53:27.58 --> 02:53:34.06 Default defensive or default hesitant can be how it how it goes how it destroys
02:53:34.30 --> 02:53:39.18 How it can shake the hearts of men and at at the time where you need them to be the most formidable
02:53:39.74 --> 02:53:42.94 It can make them question what they're doing can make them think of home
02:53:42.94 --> 02:53:49.90 It can make him hesitate in their actions and all of those things threaten the success of the mission and just imagine a world war one
02:53:50.78 --> 02:53:52.06 I just go in
02:53:52.06 --> 02:53:57.58 28 months of that of that exactly that's that's that's that in fact
02:53:57.58 --> 02:54:01.50 I did exactly it is a nightmare every single day just not
02:54:01.98 --> 02:54:07.34 Knowing if a round's gonna land in your head is the worst it's the worst position to be in
02:54:07.34 --> 02:54:14.70 In direct fire you get back to base you see you see Captain die
02:54:15.26 --> 02:54:20.30 Sean you all right I turned to see Captain got Captain die regarding me with concern
02:54:20.30 --> 02:54:24.70 Yeah, I'm okay. I guess we found out today why they moved fobs skin away from the border
02:54:24.94 --> 02:54:27.50 I guess so I'm sorry I couldn't give you any indirect
02:54:28.06 --> 02:54:30.78 Thank you pack mill assholes allies my ass
02:54:31.74 --> 02:54:35.10 You sure you're okay he asked again your hands are shaking
02:54:35.10 --> 02:54:38.06 I'll be all right sir. I lied
02:54:38.86 --> 02:54:43.10 It was just rough having to take it for so long and not being able to shoot back
02:54:43.74 --> 02:54:48.30 He put his hand on my shoulder or shook me gently if you need anything let me know
02:54:49.58 --> 02:54:54.46 Thank you sir and the unspoken was we're infantry
02:54:55.74 --> 02:55:03.98 Handle it exactly exactly we're infantry handle it. Yeah, okay if anything let me know but the unspoken is
02:55:03.98 --> 02:55:06.94 Hey brother this is the job so
02:55:07.58 --> 02:55:09.58 You know get your shit together, you know
02:55:11.02 --> 02:55:13.02 And I remember when we had that conversation
02:55:13.82 --> 02:55:19.98 We were standing outside our tactical operation operation center around the backside of where the officers were staying
02:55:20.78 --> 02:55:24.54 And I was just standing out there smoking to cigarette in my hands were shaking and he could see it
02:55:26.46 --> 02:55:28.46 You know I
02:55:28.46 --> 02:55:32.86 I look back on that moment and I was really thankful that he did he said something you know
02:55:32.86 --> 02:55:38.14 I needed to hear that I needed to hear socket up handle it. I needed that
02:55:39.90 --> 02:55:42.54 And I think that was a really strong leadership moment from for him
02:55:42.78 --> 02:55:49.42 You know to even just have the emotional intelligence to see that one of his subordinate leaders were struggling and come over and address it immediately
02:55:50.14 --> 02:55:56.30 Even if it was handle it at least I knew he was he was keeping an eye on things that it mattered
02:55:56.54 --> 02:55:58.54 You know, and I think that's important for soldiers
02:55:58.54 --> 02:56:00.54 You
02:56:01.02 --> 02:56:03.50 You talk in the book about
02:56:04.62 --> 02:56:08.06 When you're on the fob and what's going on in the fob and one of the things you got on the fob
02:56:08.14 --> 02:56:13.50 Which I think is just a common thing for all Americans at war as you had dogs little pet dogs
02:56:13.50 --> 02:56:18.38 That you guys adopted and kind of have fun with and it gives you a little break from them and not needing it gives you a little
02:56:18.86 --> 02:56:20.86 warmth in your world and
02:56:21.34 --> 02:56:27.42 I know when we always had dogs my first to point me at dogs. We had a dog named RPG and a dog named morger
02:56:27.42 --> 02:56:32.22 Cute little bastards. So what ours was trigger there you can trigger
02:56:34.46 --> 02:56:37.66 You guys are out on and up and
02:56:38.94 --> 02:56:43.34 Actually prior to this one of the dogs had like riled that one of the females
02:56:44.06 --> 02:56:47.90 She complained blah blah blah blah and you explain this all in the book
02:56:48.62 --> 02:56:50.62 But what it leads to is this
02:56:51.98 --> 02:56:53.98 The leadership
02:56:53.98 --> 02:57:00.38 On the fob took all the dogs and killed them and burned the bodies while you guys were out in the field
02:57:03.18 --> 02:57:08.46 You guys come back and I'm going to the book anger and a ignition that could work with the infantry feeds on such
02:57:08.46 --> 02:57:11.98 Emotions it motivates and makes us eager to release violence upon our fob
02:57:12.06 --> 02:57:17.82 There was no fight in Chris that morning. He's one of your troops and he was the barometer of the platoon's morale
02:57:18.46 --> 02:57:21.58 I saw his resignation reflected on everyone's faces
02:57:21.58 --> 02:57:27.66 Cowen moved like a sleepwalker even sobo appeared affected as I watched the platoon struggle that morning
02:57:27.66 --> 02:57:30.54 I realized that I'd overlooked a reality of Afghanistan
02:57:30.94 --> 02:57:36.70 We were facing two enemies not one the howconny network's fighters we could handle any time
02:57:36.70 --> 02:57:40.94 They chose to challenge us we could smite them with fire power and make them pay for the effort
02:57:41.50 --> 02:57:44.38 We would not give ground and I knew we would never know defeat
02:57:45.34 --> 02:57:47.82 But this other enemy was more devious
02:57:47.82 --> 02:57:52.70 How does one do battle with fob politics at the moment?
02:57:52.70 --> 02:57:58.22 I was at a complete loss without a doubt we needed to figure out a way to do it because more blows like this and a
02:57:58.22 --> 02:57:59.50 Conterer the platoon apart
02:57:59.50 --> 02:58:05.18 It was with relief that we put Burmel in our rear view mirrors the countryside was ours
02:58:05.34 --> 02:58:11.74 You guys are rolling out another another up devolid of politics devoid of politics stupid rules and petty slits
02:58:11.82 --> 02:58:13.82 It was the one place where we knew
02:58:13.82 --> 02:58:18.14 It was the one place where most feared to tread
02:58:18.54 --> 02:58:26.46 We were among our own kind depending on men we trusted and loved and the danger the insurgents presented at every turn
02:58:26.86 --> 02:58:29.90 seemed to small price to pay for these respects
02:58:31.58 --> 02:58:33.58 So there you are yeah
02:58:34.06 --> 02:58:39.10 It's better just to get off bed is and go into the fields you can get away from the fob politics
02:58:39.10 --> 02:58:41.90 It was I mean those dogs were members of our platoon
02:58:41.90 --> 02:58:47.50 I mean my men would come back from patrols the first thing that they would do is look for those dogs, you know and
02:58:48.22 --> 02:58:51.82 They'd sleep in the barracks with them and you know, there's this rule general order number one
02:58:51.82 --> 02:58:57.02 Some part of general order number one no dogs on the basis because you know out of fear that they'd have some disease and so
02:58:57.58 --> 02:59:01.02 The decision that was the decision to put them down was made
02:59:02.22 --> 02:59:08.14 The dog grow out at one of the male clerks who wasn't even a part of our base was on our base who flew in on a ring
02:59:08.14 --> 02:59:11.34 We're out and got grow at and then went and told her higher our brigade
02:59:12.14 --> 02:59:21.02 Headquartered elements and they flew medics down to our base that weren't stationed on our base that killed the dogs the moment we left out of the wire and we came back man and it just
02:59:23.50 --> 02:59:25.82 We weren't supposed to have them right
02:59:26.70 --> 02:59:31.98 But our medics it also vaccinated them, you know our medics that I made it safe so
02:59:33.26 --> 02:59:36.78 It was one of those things. It was just like god damn it can't you just give us this small
02:59:36.78 --> 02:59:38.78 thing, you know
02:59:41.26 --> 02:59:43.26 Rules and regulations are important
02:59:43.26 --> 02:59:48.14 I think it's of the utmost importance to follow me if you disagree with them, you know
02:59:49.10 --> 02:59:53.58 But some things like this when you're trying desperately to have soldiers cling to what little humanity
02:59:53.58 --> 02:59:58.06 They might have left in a savage land like Jesus Christ just gave us the dogs, you know
02:59:58.06 --> 03:00:00.70 They couldn't even give them that in the way that they took them from us
03:00:00.70 --> 03:00:10.62 Was even worse, you know to come back and have you know waited at the barracks. Hey, where are the dogs? Oh, hey, they they killed them and then they threw them on the burn pits
03:00:11.74 --> 03:00:19.58 You know my guys like ran out to the burn pit. I mean my men were ready to kill somebody, you know and I just remember like Jesus, you know
03:00:22.06 --> 03:00:26.22 Hey, fight the enemy out there. It's at least if you know it's life in death and
03:00:26.22 --> 03:00:31.74 There's elegance and that simplicity, right you only think you're worried about living or dying and the man next to you
03:00:32.70 --> 03:00:35.66 But when you come back on the base is how do you fight against that shit?
03:00:36.22 --> 03:00:40.94 How do you deal with that stuff? Those those things are morale killers and I'd rather
03:00:41.50 --> 03:00:46.38 Control for that by being outside the wire and being you know call my own shots and my men
03:00:46.94 --> 03:00:48.94 We're familiar with the train
03:00:49.58 --> 03:00:53.58 We know that we had each other's backs. We know that we weren't gonna stab each other in the back like that
03:00:53.58 --> 03:00:55.98 You know I mean this like those spot politics like
03:00:57.42 --> 03:01:00.14 Doorchickers warriors they don't deal well with stuff like that
03:01:00.70 --> 03:01:03.66 Yeah, it's like a glimpse of the rest of the normal world
03:01:04.62 --> 03:01:07.58 It absolutely is yeah like the fob is one
03:01:07.90 --> 03:01:10.62 Remove from normal world because you get a little bit but
03:01:11.58 --> 03:01:17.02 It still is a reflection of life just normal everyday political crap that runs around
03:01:18.78 --> 03:01:20.78 You guys get out on patrol
03:01:20.78 --> 03:01:27.98 And you guys are driving and you see a boy like a young boy alone and you stop the vehicles
03:01:28.22 --> 03:01:31.58 And here we go to the book something eight nights sir grease and said and that's sleepy
03:01:32.06 --> 03:01:34.06 Sam Elliott voice of his
03:01:34.06 --> 03:01:38.62 The years of smoking and drinking had given it a gravely rugged quality
03:01:39.34 --> 03:01:41.10 Indominable really nope
03:01:41.10 --> 03:01:47.90 I said shaking my head under my helmet camels kneeling front of the boy now talking to a low comforting voice the boy wind
03:01:47.90 --> 03:01:55.02 His head waving from side to side he seemed disengaged lost his in his own tormented world world
03:01:55.74 --> 03:01:57.90 Who the hell would give dope to a little kid?
03:01:58.86 --> 03:02:03.10 With an A and A do something like that. I thought 15 feet from the boy
03:02:03.74 --> 03:02:06.70 We both gasped and stopped in our tracks
03:02:08.14 --> 03:02:11.10 Under a shock of dirt and crusted black hair
03:02:11.50 --> 03:02:14.70 We saw a disfigured face about six years old
03:02:14.70 --> 03:02:25.34 His eyes had been gouged out the sockets burned black by whatever heated implements had been used to do the deed
03:02:27.50 --> 03:02:31.02 Next to me grease and exhaled sharply Jesus Christ what is this?
03:02:32.62 --> 03:02:34.62 The boy opened his mouth again
03:02:35.34 --> 03:02:38.30 Another wine spilled out between cracked lips
03:02:39.42 --> 03:02:42.06 Behind them we saw ruptured gums and
03:02:42.06 --> 03:02:44.06 And no teeth
03:02:44.94 --> 03:02:50.30 You're fucking kidding me grease and said get use of and dock panjota
03:02:50.94 --> 03:02:56.78 Panto ha is his name Panto ha Panto ha I said to my patoon sergeant use if reached
03:02:57.58 --> 03:03:04.06 Us first and look down at the boy either he'd seen this sort of thing before or a half a decade of war had steeled him to such sites
03:03:05.50 --> 03:03:09.18 The boy's condition evoke no visible emotions in my turf
03:03:09.18 --> 03:03:12.62 He stood quietly next to me his use car salesman
03:03:14.38 --> 03:03:20.70 Affection stowed for the moment and we haven't really talked about you. Seth much, but when you lost abduel
03:03:21.18 --> 03:03:23.58 You Seth moved up into the primary
03:03:23.74 --> 03:03:27.18 Interpreter position and you described as a use car salesman
03:03:27.18 --> 03:03:31.98 He's one of those guys. It seems a little bit shady, but you're working with what you got that's right. Yeah
03:03:32.78 --> 03:03:34.78 You end up taking the boy to a nearby village
03:03:34.78 --> 03:03:36.78 And
03:03:36.78 --> 03:03:42.06 Here you describe the village the village was a frightful site a clean bed would have been a price a luxury in this place
03:03:42.54 --> 03:03:46.14 The mud wall the hots were barren of even the most basic essentials
03:03:46.70 --> 03:03:51.50 Little food no clean water the ground between the dwellings was riddled with human feces animal
03:03:51.50 --> 03:03:55.26 Dung and filth the smell of such a place is one that none of us will ever forget
03:03:55.26 --> 03:04:01.02 It lingered like a tangible presence in the air. I could feel it seeping into my clothing for a second
03:04:01.02 --> 03:04:08.38 I flash back to my first day in country after the girl had died in my arms. I had burned my blood soaked ACUs
03:04:08.78 --> 03:04:11.18 No amount of cleaning would ever get out this stench
03:04:12.30 --> 03:04:19.50 A boy perhaps six years old limp out of a nearby hut and took station near one corner watching us with burnished black eyes
03:04:20.62 --> 03:04:25.18 There was a wary world in the world beness in them that I'd never seen back home
03:04:25.18 --> 03:04:29.90 Well, it's in bruises ran the length of his face neck and arms
03:04:31.02 --> 03:04:33.02 He'd been badly beaten
03:04:35.66 --> 03:04:37.66 And then an ancient man
03:04:37.66 --> 03:04:40.70 Clad and dirt-mard clothes emerged from one mud hut
03:04:41.58 --> 03:04:47.50 His beard was dyed red something that all village elders do to show their status as community leaders
03:04:47.98 --> 03:04:51.26 When he saw us he paused and offered a guarded greeting
03:04:52.30 --> 03:04:54.30 Then he saw the I-List boy
03:04:54.30 --> 03:04:59.10 His composure cracked and a look of pure love and relief crossed his face
03:04:59.34 --> 03:05:06.22 He hurried over and wrapped the boy in his arms the two shared words and the elder held the boy in a fierce protective embrace
03:05:07.18 --> 03:05:14.54 He looked at me the boy's head tucked under his jaw and pressed hard against his neck and I could see that the old man's eyes had grown wet
03:05:15.26 --> 03:05:17.26 He began to speak to me
03:05:17.26 --> 03:05:23.42 You said listen and then said into clipped and professional tone the village elder thanks you
03:05:24.38 --> 03:05:26.38 This boy is his grandson
03:05:27.10 --> 03:05:35.74 Greason his voice barely a whisper said you said find out what happened to this kid you said not an engaged the viller
03:05:36.14 --> 03:05:38.94 The vill the village elder in a long discussion
03:05:39.26 --> 03:05:43.90 We listened as the two conversed in their native language anxiously awaiting the answer
03:05:43.90 --> 03:05:47.82 At last you said turned his attention to us
03:05:48.70 --> 03:05:52.86 His face a mask and matter a faculty told us the elders story
03:05:54.62 --> 03:06:01.42 The enemy had swept into the village a few weeks ago bent on punishing its inhabitants for supporting the coalition
03:06:02.70 --> 03:06:05.50 I doubted that any Americans had ever visited this place
03:06:06.86 --> 03:06:10.86 The enemy had kidnapped the elders oldest grandson
03:06:10.86 --> 03:06:17.58 He was the future of the family the boy most cherished and revered in afghan culture
03:06:18.46 --> 03:06:21.58 Taking him was a blow that nobody in the village would forget
03:06:23.66 --> 03:06:27.58 They had taken the elders grandson back to one of their mountain hideouts
03:06:29.74 --> 03:06:31.74 Where they gouged out his eyes
03:06:31.74 --> 03:06:38.86 They had turned him into a sexual plaything knocking out his teeth to increase their pleasure with him
03:06:38.86 --> 03:07:02.86 They had raped this sexual boy for weeks
03:07:02.86 --> 03:07:06.86 So that's what you're dealing with
03:07:08.46 --> 03:07:10.06 Yeah, you know
03:07:11.50 --> 03:07:13.18 The enemy of that we face over there
03:07:14.30 --> 03:07:20.30 That's what they're capable of and in this village there's no way that I mean we didn't ever even come into contact with them
03:07:20.30 --> 03:07:23.10 There were so many small border villages
03:07:24.70 --> 03:07:31.82 And the Hindu-Kish mountains that have not even talked to a tribe that's a click down the road let alone ever seen an American troop
03:07:31.82 --> 03:07:35.98 There's no just the mere thought that
03:07:36.78 --> 03:07:40.30 They may have been working with Americans was enough to cause something like that
03:07:41.02 --> 03:07:45.26 It just shows you the depth and the prairie the enemy that we're fighting is why we fight against them
03:07:45.26 --> 03:07:50.46 This is why Americans are there this is why we matter this is the why the way that we fight matters
03:07:51.18 --> 03:07:54.22 You know there is a right and wrong to how the world
03:07:54.22 --> 03:07:59.90 You know conducts itself, you know I firmly believe that
03:08:00.54 --> 03:08:07.10 You know some cultures are better than others, you know I think our Western culture should be preserved and fought for and protected
03:08:07.66 --> 03:08:09.66 and promulgated as much as possible
03:08:10.86 --> 03:08:14.54 We live in the best country on the face of the earth why shouldn't we try to do that for other people
03:08:15.58 --> 03:08:19.82 If and when we can I know that that's probably a controversial view but
03:08:19.82 --> 03:08:24.46 You know those I know that those people in Afghanistan
03:08:25.82 --> 03:08:31.74 This village in particular was so grateful for what we brought to them how we help them we did a medcap in their village
03:08:32.54 --> 03:08:37.50 So much of what we did in Afghanistan was taking care of the people that was like a that was really important to us
03:08:37.50 --> 03:08:38.14 I mean we were the
03:08:39.26 --> 03:08:43.90 We were the we were the main powerbrovers in the a.o. there's no question about that
03:08:43.90 --> 03:08:48.94 We dominated this rain we kicked the enemies ass, but we really did care about the Afghan people in fact
03:08:48.94 --> 03:08:52.14 That first engagement that we that we talked about
03:08:52.94 --> 03:08:59.42 Today we were going to do a human our initial tasking was doing observation pros yes, but we were stopping off and
03:08:59.42 --> 03:09:01.26 Advilages to do a humanitarian
03:09:01.82 --> 03:09:04.22 Distribution, you know we blankets food rice
03:09:05.18 --> 03:09:09.02 Coloring books crayons for kids and I remember like getting back from that mission point out this
03:09:09.34 --> 03:09:16.78 Crayola crayon box with a center hunter center punched pull the set a seven center punched hole of 762 round right through the center of it and so
03:09:16.78 --> 03:09:20.06 We cared a lot about the people man and
03:09:20.62 --> 03:09:24.86 You know the enemy and that first rocket attack where they killed a bunch of those kids didn't matter
03:09:24.86 --> 03:09:28.54 They knew they those rockets had landed in a school. They kept firing at us, you know
03:09:29.34 --> 03:09:34.86 There was an informant a human intelligence informant that we were working with the hope exploit high by your targets in the border
03:09:35.26 --> 03:09:36.78 Early on in the deployment
03:09:36.78 --> 03:09:41.74 He was one of the few people that lived in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan
03:09:41.74 --> 03:09:47.50 Had the courage to stay there throughout at all enemy found out that he was working and helping help on us and
03:09:47.66 --> 03:09:51.74 They third grenade in the middle of his compound and killed a newborn baby killed his baby
03:09:51.74 --> 03:09:54.70 I mean they just do terrible things to their kids and
03:09:56.86 --> 03:10:00.70 That's the kind of shit that stays with you forever. It's it's you know
03:10:00.70 --> 03:10:05.02 I'm telling you I like I said before I don't lose a wink of sleep over the bad guys that we killed over there
03:10:05.02 --> 03:10:07.02 I'm not
03:10:07.02 --> 03:10:08.78 Don't lose a wink of sleep over it
03:10:08.78 --> 03:10:14.62 But it's moments like this that stay with you forever. It's you see and I think like you get a lot of time to think about this
03:10:14.62 --> 03:10:19.66 Sort of shit when you're over there because like when you look at the kids and you're driving through these villages and
03:10:20.14 --> 03:10:22.38 You know they liked American troops, you know
03:10:22.38 --> 03:10:25.42 They appreciated what we did they appreciated how he protected them
03:10:26.14 --> 03:10:29.58 The people in Afghanistan and those children they have nothing
03:10:30.14 --> 03:10:35.10 Nothing there's no running water. There's no electricity. There's no roads. There's no economy. There's no jobs
03:10:35.10 --> 03:10:39.98 The men all summer long go out there and they cut wood so they have enough wood to keep their family warm
03:10:39.98 --> 03:10:42.86 Doing the winter and then the cycle starts again and so these kids though
03:10:43.98 --> 03:10:45.34 I remember watching them
03:10:45.58 --> 03:10:51.50 From an observation post one day early on and like just watching them run around and play soccer with this deflated soccer ball and bare feet in the mountains
03:10:51.50 --> 03:10:56.62 Like running on these like rocks that had to be razor sharp, but I just think into myself like damn it man
03:10:56.94 --> 03:11:00.54 kids are the most amazing thing in the world. You know it's because
03:11:01.58 --> 03:11:03.26 Because here they are
03:11:03.26 --> 03:11:09.42 They don't even know they have nothing they literally have nothing and probably one of the most dangerous places in the face of the planet
03:11:09.42 --> 03:11:12.22 And here they are running around playing soccer. They don't even have shoes, you know
03:11:12.70 --> 03:11:19.82 Running around playing soccer being kids, you know, they're so awesome. You know and that's what we were there to protect them and then then then to see
03:11:20.94 --> 03:11:22.62 to see
03:11:22.62 --> 03:11:23.98 You know
03:11:23.98 --> 03:11:25.42 The way that the enemy treated them
03:11:26.78 --> 03:11:29.50 I knew we just had to kill as many of them as human they possible
03:11:29.50 --> 03:11:33.58 Like for the year that we were supposed to be there we ended being there a year and a half but
03:11:34.22 --> 03:11:38.30 the year that we were there I just felt it from this point forward like yeah we were in fights
03:11:39.02 --> 03:11:43.98 You know we weren't gonna draw our weapon unless we were fired upon first but all that changed after this
03:11:47.26 --> 03:11:53.82 You you continue on here more members of the elders family ventured out they came to the boy to hug and reassure him
03:11:53.82 --> 03:11:58.54 He whimpered softly and I wondered if he was crying then I realized he couldn't cry
03:12:00.70 --> 03:12:02.70 His tear ducts had been burned away
03:12:09.42 --> 03:12:11.82 I mean don't people that do that to young children
03:12:12.86 --> 03:12:18.62 You know don't people like that deserve to die. Yes 100% I mean they don't deserve
03:12:18.62 --> 03:12:24.46 Life is a privilege every single waking breath that you have as a privilege you know
03:12:26.38 --> 03:12:28.38 And they certainly don't earn it
03:12:36.78 --> 03:12:42.86 Moving through moving on back to the book pin hold nice sat together watching an episode of the TV series the office
03:12:42.86 --> 03:12:49.42 We howled with laughter and thought about how foreign the world of the cubicle land was to us
03:12:49.82 --> 03:12:55.26 This is the greatest show ever I told tin hole I knew you'd like it sir was that your first time seeing it? Yes
03:12:55.90 --> 03:13:00.38 You know how far away from scranton to jigrop? I'm from Pittsburgh. Oh there you go.
03:13:00.38 --> 03:13:05.90 Couple hours you know, but we damn you we watched it man. I'm telling you so we were into all kinds of shows over there
03:13:05.90 --> 03:13:09.66 You know the whole putton we gather around this is like I mean we had these like little
03:13:09.66 --> 03:13:15.42 Laptop computers we all sit around like screen this big and watch these shows but the office was one of those things
03:13:16.22 --> 03:13:22.06 That it was just like holy shit like look at what we just talked about how much of a
03:13:22.38 --> 03:13:25.18 I mean it's just the most sad depressing thing. I mean
03:13:25.82 --> 03:13:32.06 But people actually live like this like I know people liked white and in real life that work
03:13:32.06 --> 03:13:37.18 You know what I mean like yeah, this is I I just thought it was such a crazy
03:13:37.18 --> 03:13:42.78 Like compared like here we are doing this Americans actually live like this. Yes
03:13:43.26 --> 03:13:45.74 This is where they go to work every day crazy, you know
03:13:45.74 --> 03:13:48.86 It's completely crazy. You got a kid who's at his eyes burned out
03:13:49.34 --> 03:13:53.50 He's bad as teeth pulled so he could be a sex toy for these savages
03:13:53.58 --> 03:13:57.58 We found we found kids like that other units all over Afghanistan
03:13:58.30 --> 03:14:00.62 It's heinous and then then then the movie
03:14:01.26 --> 03:14:04.86 Slumdog millionaire came out a few years later and that happens in that movie too
03:14:04.86 --> 03:14:07.42 It's it's it's just
03:14:11.18 --> 03:14:13.98 I mean it's just a dare I don't understand it I don't understand
03:14:15.66 --> 03:14:21.50 It's just people that do that to children do not deserve to breathe. They don't deserve to live no
03:14:22.22 --> 03:14:24.22 zero
03:14:25.42 --> 03:14:27.66 So you guys are you guys are carrying on
03:14:27.66 --> 03:14:35.42 Um for rare change of pace we were inside the wire with a day off we had desperately needed to break the men were relaxing sleeping and lifting weights
03:14:35.74 --> 03:14:39.98 The episode ended gotten me more I asked whole first season sir. You're you're awesome
03:14:40.94 --> 03:14:42.62 We started another episode
03:14:42.78 --> 03:14:45.10 Made way through pinhole wrinkled as nose and looked at me
03:14:45.66 --> 03:14:49.34 Wait, are you an office fan? Yes you are yes
03:14:50.06 --> 03:14:54.54 It's like my favorite show have you ever watched the British office. Yes. I don't think it's his funny
03:14:54.54 --> 03:15:00.14 It's not as fun. I don't find British people. I know what's fun. I like more the British one you do because the British one is is
03:15:01.98 --> 03:15:06.06 I don't like this how don't like this hot chocolate take it's kind of depressing
03:15:07.18 --> 03:15:12.62 The British one is kind of depressed is stopian because you know because in the American one
03:15:13.42 --> 03:15:19.50 It's funny and it's it's funny because you're like oh this is a little bit this is a little bit
03:15:19.50 --> 03:15:21.50 Um
03:15:21.74 --> 03:15:23.74 It's a little bit too much right
03:15:24.30 --> 03:15:27.70 Michael Scott is a little bit too much. He's just a little bit too much
03:15:27.70 --> 03:15:32.30 I love not tons too much, but he's just a little bit too much and you go okay. He's a caricature
03:15:32.46 --> 03:15:39.04 He's he's an extreme version for comic effect, right? That's what you get when you watch the American office and all the characters
03:15:39.04 --> 03:15:43.50 You know Dwight he's he's like you know a guy like Dwight
03:15:44.62 --> 03:15:48.78 But Dwight is like is like one level up from that that's what makes him funny
03:15:48.78 --> 03:15:54.06 Right, so you and then you mix in kind of the regular kind of normal characters and we know people like them
03:15:54.06 --> 03:15:56.22 And so then you get to see this story unfold, but it's all
03:15:56.78 --> 03:15:58.38 slightly beyond
03:15:58.38 --> 03:16:02.34 actual belief I feel like I know bosses like Michael Scott
03:16:02.34 --> 03:16:07.10 I feel like I see them sometimes on my god. You do see them you see them in little bits and pieces
03:16:07.26 --> 03:16:09.26 But the British office
03:16:09.66 --> 03:16:15.34 You're like hey, this is this is like what a guy is really like this guy is really like delusional and this guy
03:16:15.34 --> 03:16:21.66 It's just to me it has this thing to it that I that I like I like the fact that you know
03:16:21.66 --> 03:16:23.66 I heard this say it about
03:16:24.06 --> 03:16:25.26 singers
03:16:25.26 --> 03:16:27.26 Really good singers
03:16:27.58 --> 03:16:31.90 Have a hint of sadness in their voice when you hear when you hear a
03:16:32.42 --> 03:16:37.66 Really good singer saying you'll think it's really good if they have a hint of sadness in their voice
03:16:37.66 --> 03:16:43.34 And I think the British office has like a hint of sadness in it that to me makes it better
03:16:43.34 --> 03:16:48.70 You like the sadness the sadness makes you happy the no I don't know if it makes me happy
03:16:48.70 --> 03:16:51.42 But it hits me in a way that I feel is is
03:16:54.06 --> 03:16:56.54 I think it hits me in a in a stronger way
03:16:57.10 --> 03:17:02.70 This is this is some this is some deep jacco stuff here. I just really expect to get that deep into your emotional
03:17:03.26 --> 03:17:07.82 He reacts to the obvious here we are here. We are indeed we're we're at shrimp farms right
03:17:07.82 --> 03:17:09.82 Oh
03:17:12.54 --> 03:17:14.26 My my my my my
03:17:14.26 --> 03:17:15.26 Mos my you
03:17:15.26 --> 03:17:18.62 Do you do I my my Mos yeah, oh quit talking
03:17:19.98 --> 03:17:26.06 The funny thing is my family my whole family likes the office so we've had you know if we're gonna watch TV show
03:17:26.06 --> 03:17:29.14 That's probably actually I don't mean no if we watch anymore to you any other
03:17:29.14 --> 03:17:33.74 You watch office space the movie I've watched the office space the lighting
03:17:33.74 --> 03:17:41.50 Yes, because office I forget which is which but the office the show and office space one was made to be like the
03:17:41.50 --> 03:17:45.14 Like office space was made to be the movie version of the office or vice versa
03:17:45.14 --> 03:17:49.10 I forget what you want no that well, maybe but the British office came out and
03:17:50.06 --> 03:17:56.54 That is what the office in America is based on and it's the office space was based on a cartoon like a comic strip
03:17:56.54 --> 03:17:58.54 Yeah, so it was like
03:17:58.54 --> 03:18:03.98 So it might have been vice versa, but basically one was like the movie version of the other
03:18:04.46 --> 03:18:10.54 But Ricky Jervais in England wrote the original office and that's one's in England
03:18:10.54 --> 03:18:14.70 And then they took it and revamped it a little bit it made it a little bit happier for the US of a
03:18:14.94 --> 03:18:19.38 We like the smile and laugh and we want to make sure Sean Barnett was getting his
03:18:19.54 --> 03:18:21.54 Getting his humor on right there
03:18:21.54 --> 03:18:26.38 I know you know what you know what Choco the sadness doesn't make me happy
03:18:26.38 --> 03:18:30.18 I know like we feel like there needs to be another podcast exploring that
03:18:30.78 --> 03:18:32.78 Well, we'll go into that
03:18:33.54 --> 03:18:35.54 But speaking of just
03:18:35.82 --> 03:18:37.82 Things not being funny
03:18:38.62 --> 03:18:43.62 You going back to the book, sir. That's pretty nasty what that shit coming out of your ear
03:18:43.62 --> 03:18:47.06 I reached up and felt something like jello coming out of my on my neck
03:18:47.06 --> 03:18:50.82 I was pink and red and streaked with yellow
03:18:51.26 --> 03:18:55.86 It smells like banana sir. He added I got up and wiped it off
03:18:55.86 --> 03:18:58.06 Thirdly embarrassed so you need to get that checked out
03:18:58.06 --> 03:19:04.10 I nodded as a sat back down. I know I'll get a scan of burger at background at Bogram a few days
03:19:04.74 --> 03:19:08.70 When I had home on leave. Thank you everyone's worried about you. I was worried too
03:19:09.06 --> 03:19:12.74 But I knew if a real doc examined me. He'd never let me return to the men
03:19:12.74 --> 03:19:20.06 I was having bouts of double vision and frequent migraines and at times I was having trouble remembering things as a result
03:19:20.06 --> 03:19:23.82 I made an obsessive effort to write everything down before missions
03:19:23.82 --> 03:19:29.10 We finished the second episode and I said goodbye to pinhole headed back to my room. Lieutenant a
03:19:29.66 --> 03:19:36.46 Deep and booming voice called a staff sergeant was walking down the hallway in our hooch a cigarette dangling from his tight lips about my age with her
03:19:36.46 --> 03:19:42.18 Seating brown black hair. He walked with gravitas as if he would made of chiseled granite
03:19:42.18 --> 03:19:48.42 He had a rounded face with sharp cheeks eyes partially concealed by a squint a Ranger tab on his shoulder
03:19:49.18 --> 03:19:51.18 What can I do you for sergeant?
03:19:51.18 --> 03:19:52.86 Who the hell is this guy?
03:19:52.86 --> 03:19:54.14 Jeff Hall
03:19:54.14 --> 03:20:00.60 I'm a new squad leader sir. He stuck out his hand. I shook it and nearly had my fingers squashed like sausages
03:20:00.94 --> 03:20:04.82 That'd meet you all welcome to our wall. Poutoon. Thank you sir
03:20:05.82 --> 03:20:10.48 And this that's your introduced introduction to this guy. All who seemed like he was just a
03:20:11.38 --> 03:20:16.60 Highly motivated individual ready was man. And he's I don't know if I don't know if we're gonna talk about our
03:20:16.60 --> 03:20:23.88 Anopity saved this Marines life. Marine gets shot in the pelvis is
03:20:24.28 --> 03:20:30.36 Pelvis now like I wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for Jeff Hall and man was he a character. That's for sure
03:20:31.24 --> 03:20:33.24 You're you're out in the field
03:20:33.88 --> 03:20:38.96 And we'll just jump right into it. We triggered the ambush early and from a different direction that they'd expected
03:20:39.60 --> 03:20:44.20 As we pulled into a perimeter around the village their fire was disjointed not nearly as accurate as usual
03:20:44.20 --> 03:20:48.16 We'd thrown them off guard and they'd reflexively open fire they had waited
03:20:48.60 --> 03:20:52.80 They they had they waited until we were in the northern part of the ambush
03:20:52.88 --> 03:20:56.64 We would have been hit as they originally designed for a moment
03:20:56.64 --> 03:21:02.12 I wish Captain Dye was here having two platoons to manage was awkward since I couldn't really give orders to Delta
03:21:02.12 --> 03:21:05.12 I could only give the platoon squad leaders guidance
03:21:05.76 --> 03:21:08.92 So you're out there with two platoons at this point. I was a senior officer on the ground
03:21:08.92 --> 03:21:16.44 But it's not my it's not my job to maneuver more than my platoon. I'll do it now do it well. Yeah, but
03:21:16.92 --> 03:21:23.28 It's so it was a leadership challenge for sure because those guys don't they're not under my command was their officer out there too
03:21:27.04 --> 03:21:33.000 It's hard. No, I I they had an officer. I wasn't sure if he was out here for that for this specific engagement
03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:39.18 I think that he was which is why it makes it awkward because we were the same rank. You know
03:21:39.18 --> 03:21:42.30 I was the senior platoon leader of senior year lieutenant out there on the ground
03:21:42.30 --> 03:21:45.48 But still this is why captains exists and you know
03:21:45.48 --> 03:21:51.02 This is why company commanders exist the maneuver companies. You know the tenants exist in the army anyway to maneuverable tunes
03:21:51.02 --> 03:21:54.96 So it would have been great to have a company commander out there maneuvering these elements
03:21:55.56 --> 03:21:59.62 He but in Captain Dye's defense and I I know that he believed this
03:22:00.16 --> 03:22:02.16 He believed us to be
03:22:02.16 --> 03:22:08.84 You know he didn't micromanages. Yeah, he knew us to be competent and he let us do our he let us do our job
03:22:08.84 --> 03:22:14.42 And he felt that he could maneuver us from the fog which is his prerogative and he could he could do that so you guys are in this
03:22:14.42 --> 03:22:19.24 It's like another scenario unfolding where clearly these guys are looking to come and cut all your heads off
03:22:19.24 --> 03:22:21.48 Which is a real rare sharing thing and
03:22:22.52 --> 03:22:27.56 Here we get you guys are going back and forth going out going out to the perimeter like assessing
03:22:27.56 --> 03:22:33.72 Make sure you guys are doing a good job and then you're coming back into the middle kind of debriefing each other on what's happening with with the
03:22:34.28 --> 03:22:39.46 Fire team leaders or the or actually that I guess the squad leaders and you're doing that a couple times and then finally it gets to a point
03:22:39.46 --> 03:22:43.14 Just as our leaders return to the middle of the perimeter the enemy commander made his move
03:22:43.14 --> 03:22:48.94 Hall whose rig was on the eastern side of the perimeter said calmly sir their Russian us coming out
03:22:48.94 --> 03:22:56.000 You're coming out our hill now the two enemy forces struck the northeast and southeast parts of our perimeter in one palmel charge
03:22:56.000 --> 03:23:00.76 This time they did not bound as on June 10th instead they ran straight for us
03:23:00.76 --> 03:23:07.24 We picked out a leader and sniped him in the midstroke in midstrad he went down with a wound to the shoulder in a flash to
03:23:07.24 --> 03:23:10.64 Insurgents grab their fallen comrades and whisked him to the rear their casualty of
03:23:10.76 --> 03:23:17.40 Accuation was stunningly fast. I'm thinking when I was reading this I was thinking oh these guys aren't as good as the guys you killed by
03:23:17.40 --> 03:23:22.66 I weren't you killed the good. Yes, yes, and now they had inexperienced guys that were just
03:23:22.66 --> 03:23:27.94 But you're one of the few people that has ever picked that up in the book. Yes, we killed so many of them and
03:23:28.18 --> 03:23:33.46 Little we were getting intel around this time that the Pakistani Taliban tribes in Pakistan
03:23:33.46 --> 03:23:39.90 They were no no longer willing to commit their sons to the fight in our area of operations because we were just killing them and stacking bodies
03:23:39.90 --> 03:23:43.74 So high they couldn't keep up and they didn't want to commit their sons to a losing fight
03:23:43.90 --> 03:23:48.86 We were killing all the good ones and now we reached a point in time and our deployment where
03:23:48.86 --> 03:23:55.70 We were starting to know the terrain better than the enemy we'd been there and operated there longer and this is what you're seeing in this chapter
03:23:55.70 --> 03:24:01.16 Yeah, and I'm just thinking to myself you think about our view of terrain over time
03:24:01.16 --> 03:24:05.54 We're looking at maps. We're seeing an imagery one meter imagery
03:24:05.74 --> 03:24:12.06 We're plotting points on it. I mean and you're out there every day. Yeah, you're gonna have good terrain knowledge after
03:24:12.06 --> 03:24:19.22 Hello, many eight months you've been there at this point. We did they couldn't hide from us they couldn't hide from us and we would we would we would roll up on them
03:24:19.98 --> 03:24:24.02 And disrupt their operations just and just surprise them, you know
03:24:24.02 --> 03:24:27.30 So whereas early on in the deployment we were the ones getting ambushed now
03:24:27.30 --> 03:24:31.40 We were the ones rolling up in the middle of them trying to lay an ambush and we were laying waste of them while they did it
03:24:32.40 --> 03:24:36.10 Back to the book right then the first 105 shells exploded in their midst
03:24:36.10 --> 03:24:41.54 We'd called for fire dangerously close Captain die who's the operation center who's at the operation center in Burmel
03:24:41.54 --> 03:24:49.86 Had made sure we had ample support again the gunners back on base had poured it on mixing high explosive shells with white phosphorus the dreaded willy
03:24:49.86 --> 03:24:52.88 Pete the gunners called this deadly mixture
03:24:53.26 --> 03:24:57.86 Shaken bake the high explosive shook the ground in the willy peak cooked anything it touched
03:24:58.58 --> 03:25:05.22 a curtain of fire and steel street with tendrils of white phosphorus erupted behind the enemies main line of advance
03:25:05.22 --> 03:25:09.50 We pinned them against us it we pinned them against us if they tried to break contact
03:25:09.50 --> 03:25:15.02 They would be massacred by artillery fire if they stayed in place they'd be mode down by our men if they tried to close
03:25:15.02 --> 03:25:19.54 We'd mowed them down faster desperate now the trapped insurgents bolted for us
03:25:19.54 --> 03:25:22.62 They're wounded and dying carpeting the hillside in their wake
03:25:23.38 --> 03:25:26.46 There was a confidence in the men we'd lacked on June 10th
03:25:26.46 --> 03:25:32.06 We'd seen this drill before with a more talented enemy force and the men reacted with ruthless violence
03:25:32.06 --> 03:25:39.14 No shouting this time no euphoric moments or episodes of near despair our emotions remained even keeled cold
03:25:39.14 --> 03:25:43.10 But laced with controlled rage that had been bottled up inside us for weeks
03:25:43.10 --> 03:25:48.10 We unleashed it all in a merciless torrent the enemy close to 25 meters
03:25:48.10 --> 03:25:53.50 We could see those wicked eight inch knives dangling from their belts in sight
03:25:54.82 --> 03:26:02.34 Inside oh the sight infuriated us the men fired and reloaded with a complex speed the artillery rain grew
03:26:02.34 --> 03:26:08.26 Ever more intense over the radio captain died reported that he dispatch second-pultune as our quick reaction force
03:26:08.26 --> 03:26:14.82 20 minutes later the NCO's return to the middle of the perimeter a low had descended on the battlefield as the enemies
03:26:15.38 --> 03:26:18.42 Lead waves had been killed almost to the last man
03:26:19.14 --> 03:26:22.90 One at a time our squad leaders reported the situation to be well-in-hand
03:26:23.14 --> 03:26:29.22 Hall triumphantly announced where fucking wasting them sir. Yeah, Campbell echoed the men are slaughtering them
03:26:29.62 --> 03:26:33.30 Behind us the moon roes over the endless ridges of the Hindu Kush
03:26:33.30 --> 03:26:40.02 Brightening the battlefield with a silvery glow their coming against her you know what to do the huddle broke and
03:26:40.58 --> 03:26:45.62 Back into the action they went the slaughter continued unabated for almost three hours
03:26:46.42 --> 03:26:49.62 We killed so many of them that their casualties evacuation plan collapsed
03:26:49.62 --> 03:26:54.06 They simply didn't have the man power to left to pull their men out torn bodies late
03:26:54.30 --> 03:26:58.06 Uncollected on the hillside bits of white phosphorus embedded within them
03:26:58.06 --> 03:27:05.62 Their fat sizzled in pop for hours until the metallic stench of the Willie Pete blended with the sticky odor of burn flesh
03:27:06.14 --> 03:27:08.14 Hell's barbecue
03:27:09.42 --> 03:27:10.78 Second-pultune arrived
03:27:10.78 --> 03:27:16.02 Burley all over the top energy his voice echoed over the hill top as he belled orders at his men
03:27:16.02 --> 03:27:21.72 Greece and jumped out of this one of second-pultunes trucks and on the and on bow legs sonned over to us
03:27:22.06 --> 03:27:24.42 Hacer he said sounded like sling blade
03:27:24.42 --> 03:27:27.46 Look at you acting all John Wayne out here without me
03:27:28.02 --> 03:27:33.80 Where the hell have you been I asked it had taken 45 minutes to get this to this abandoned village after leaving Burmel
03:27:34.30 --> 03:27:39.58 It had taken burley and our quick reaction force three and a half hours to go the same distance
03:27:40.10 --> 03:27:45.02 Greece and later told me that Burley had called a possible roadside bomb a few kilometers away from our fight
03:27:45.02 --> 03:27:49.14 He had ordered the platoon to stop they sat parked on the road out of the fight
03:27:49.14 --> 03:27:57.06 Greece and grew grew increasingly frustrated he saw no evidence of a roadside bomb and nothing was being done to investigate or clear anything in the road
03:27:57.22 --> 03:28:03.22 But since he was only a passenger he could not do anything about it as soon as the assaults against us as ended
03:28:03.22 --> 03:28:04.22 He'd ended
03:28:04.22 --> 03:28:08.50 Burley declared the road ahead clear and the platoon had continued on its way
03:28:10.66 --> 03:28:12.66 Not the kind of support you're looking for no
03:28:12.66 --> 03:28:21.70 No, you know, and that's you know not everybody that that puts on the uniformers beyond reproach we all make mistakes and you know
03:28:23.62 --> 03:28:30.74 That initial ambush that second platoon got caught in to set the tone for that platoon not the men the men
03:28:31.14 --> 03:28:35.30 They wanted they wanted to do the job and do the job well, but
03:28:35.62 --> 03:28:41.66 For the leadership it set the tone for the leadership and then the culture of that platoon to where they want to do a void contact
03:28:41.66 --> 03:28:45.98 At all costs, you know, they were playing the long game and so far as
03:28:46.54 --> 03:28:47.54 You know
03:28:47.54 --> 03:28:55.06 They didn't want to be in the fight because they didn't want to take the risk of losing or having guys who did hurt killed and I get that I do and you know
03:28:55.06 --> 03:28:57.06 In this in this particular
03:28:57.06 --> 03:29:01.82 And one of the for example one of the leaders of that platoon had a wife that was pregnant and he you know
03:29:01.82 --> 03:29:09.06 He wanted to go home and I get that but that is not unlike the situation of every single one of my soldiers who were out there bleeding on the line need help
03:29:09.06 --> 03:29:13.06 In this particular instance, we had it well in hand, but
03:29:13.30 --> 03:29:19.86 The fact of the matter is when you call for a QRF it's a no bullshit like we need you as fast as humanly possible now there is
03:29:20.06 --> 03:29:26.10 Me god, I mean how many happened? Yeah how many times is a QRF hit with an ID because they the enemy knows that's our battle dry
03:29:26.10 --> 03:29:28.10 I do get that and it's nighttime
03:29:28.78 --> 03:29:36.06 But Greece and was on the ground with him and he said that it took a long time to over three out three and a half hours to get to us on the battlefield that night
03:29:36.06 --> 03:29:43.06 And and really that drove a rift between our platoons it really did and
03:29:44.34 --> 03:29:46.34 I think that the
03:29:46.98 --> 03:29:51.50 I think that the what we learned that day is that like we really have to rely on
03:29:52.34 --> 03:29:54.34 We really can only count on ourselves
03:29:54.34 --> 03:29:56.34 You know
03:29:56.34 --> 03:29:58.50 We we operated with Delta Delta Platoon out there
03:29:59.14 --> 03:30:01.14 They always had our backs
03:30:01.14 --> 03:30:06.74 Seconds who did as well, I mean I don't want to I don't want to say that they they they didn't do the job but the leadership culture was different
03:30:06.94 --> 03:30:08.94 It was a different culture
03:30:11.82 --> 03:30:13.82 You're now back on base and
03:30:15.62 --> 03:30:20.86 It's actually it's actually time for you to go on leave and so here you go back to the book the next day
03:30:20.86 --> 03:30:24.46 Our once overweight forward observer Cole came to see me
03:30:24.46 --> 03:30:30.30 He'd been working out nonstop since arriving at Burmel several months before he dropped more than 20 pounds
03:30:30.30 --> 03:30:36.70 Looked lean and mean it was all set to go out and patrol with us the first sergeant cleared him to roll beyond the wire and he was eager to rejoin and
03:30:36.70 --> 03:30:39.90 Some be part of our band again a few more days in the gym a couple more
03:30:40.54 --> 03:30:44.82 After that for final preparations and he transitioned back to us and the meantime
03:30:44.82 --> 03:30:48.42 He was still working with the aviation guys to schedule seats on available helicopters
03:30:48.78 --> 03:30:51.66 Sir, we have a bird coming in an hour aren't you supposed to go on leave?
03:30:51.66 --> 03:30:58.06 Do you want to slot Cole is wearing ridiculous yellow sneakers through my exhaustion? I gaped at them
03:30:58.06 --> 03:31:00.94 Yeah, Cole that'd be great, but what the hell?
03:31:00.94 --> 03:31:05.22 I said pointing at issues he grinned their cool Cole they look like big bird shoes
03:31:05.82 --> 03:31:10.62 They make me run like the wind sir run like the wind I had no time to shower barely get time to unpack
03:31:10.62 --> 03:31:14.06 I've threw a few things into a bag. I changed my uniform later
03:31:14.22 --> 03:31:18.86 Cole checked back with me about a half an hour later. Sir the flight's full, but I'm gonna get you on it. Don't worry
03:31:19.06 --> 03:31:22.54 He told me to get out to the landing zone and wait for the helicopter
03:31:22.54 --> 03:31:28.46 I said I hasty good bond in the cartoon. I had no time to do anything else and made my way to the pad
03:31:28.46 --> 03:31:34.94 The abrupt farewell even if it was temporary felt jagged and raw truth was as much as I wanted to see my family back home
03:31:34.94 --> 03:31:36.14 I
03:31:36.14 --> 03:31:38.14 Didn't want to leave the one I had here
03:31:40.14 --> 03:31:45.54 So the helicopters coming cold dashed up to me in a moment after they touched down got a spot for you sir
03:31:45.54 --> 03:31:49.74 You know, I always take area. I was profoundly grateful. Yeah, Cole you sure do
03:31:49.74 --> 03:31:53.54 I'll see when I get back he smiled and waved can't wait to be out there with you sir
03:31:53.54 --> 03:31:57.30 I shook his hand and thank him for all he'd done for us. He he seemed embarrassed
03:31:57.30 --> 03:32:03.10 He hated to have attention drawn to himself and felt most comfortable working in the background taking care of the
03:32:03.10 --> 03:32:05.10 Poutine anyway he could
03:32:05.50 --> 03:32:11.10 So you take off the first stop as in as a dog room you get there and of course
03:32:12.14 --> 03:32:15.18 You're walking around and you get this lieutenant
03:32:15.18 --> 03:32:22.14 A US Army major demanded he stood staring at me hands on hips a look of disgust on his face
03:32:22.14 --> 03:32:27.14 His ACUs were so clean and well fitting that I assumed they had been tailored and pressed
03:32:27.14 --> 03:32:31.18 He wore no combat badges no sign that he was a ranger or even infantry
03:32:31.18 --> 03:32:34.70 He had never I'd never noticed that sort of thing until that moment
03:32:34.70 --> 03:32:38.70 I wonder if he was going to be salsa dancing tonight
03:32:38.70 --> 03:32:43.98 Yes, sir. I asked where do I clean yourself up your uniforms of disgrace?
03:32:45.50 --> 03:32:50.94 His worn mine were his war and mine were so different that there was no way for our worlds to meet
03:32:50.94 --> 03:32:53.42 I didn't even have the energy to try
03:32:56.22 --> 03:33:02.22 Good times I now so good back in Boggrem. I mean they had salsa dancing night. Oh, yeah, that's I mean
03:33:02.22 --> 03:33:04.94 You go on Boggrem. I mean like those I mean again
03:33:04.94 --> 03:33:11.66 This is the divide between war fighters and in the rear, you know, it's like you get back and like I
03:33:12.22 --> 03:33:16.30 I remember I didn't have time to change. I still got blood on my FLC and on my body armor
03:33:16.30 --> 03:33:21.58 And one of my squad leaders have been shot in the ankle. I'm rushing to get on these ring routes because they only come out to these outlying fobs
03:33:21.58 --> 03:33:22.86 So often, you know
03:33:22.86 --> 03:33:27.42 You gotta get on the bird when it shows up or you might not get another one for a month
03:33:27.42 --> 03:33:33.18 My whole family's expecting me to be home so I rush I get off the bird first thing that I see is this major right on steel beach
03:33:33.18 --> 03:33:37.34 And I'm like I see this guy. I just he's got like this eye for me and I'm like God damn
03:33:37.34 --> 03:33:42.46 I'm like trying to like not look at him and he like makes a beeline right for me and the first thing he says is
03:33:42.70 --> 03:33:47.66 You know your uniform is a disgrace you gotta get you gotta get your ass cleaned up. I know
03:33:47.66 --> 03:33:49.50 I know that you know you're probably out there
03:33:49.50 --> 03:33:53.66 He gave me the one. I know you're probably I'm like sorry. I just I mean like thinking of myself like sorry
03:33:53.66 --> 03:33:57.10 Just got off a goddamn bird like Jesus like and then of course
03:33:57.10 --> 03:34:01.42 He's like you don't want to be about taking the magazine out on my weapon like because you're not supposed to have a magazine on your weapon
03:34:01.42 --> 03:34:07.02 A biogram you're supposed to wear a road guard belt everywhere you go. I mean it there are more regulations in biogram air force base
03:34:07.02 --> 03:34:11.02 And Afghanistan there are in Fort Drum or any military base hack back here in the States
03:34:11.58 --> 03:34:14.38 And so I mean it was just like I
03:34:15.34 --> 03:34:18.38 So like I got prison strong when I was in Afghanistan
03:34:18.38 --> 03:34:23.02 When we were on on operations all we did was lift on our gym, you know and our and it was like it was
03:34:23.02 --> 03:34:27.66 Get over to work. We made a work. It was great, you know and so we get back to biogram though, man, and it's like
03:34:27.66 --> 03:34:33.50 It's like amazing, you know, there there are I'm like walking down on my covered dirt fell with blood and muck
03:34:33.50 --> 03:34:39.34 I take a warm showers much hot waters just want they got these like sauna like wood panels
03:34:39.34 --> 03:34:43.90 I'm walking on I'm like this is great. I'm in there on you know in the bathroom there are actual toilets
03:34:43.90 --> 03:34:49.18 We would we would go and like the first experience that I had like go to the bathroom and I've gandestin after
03:34:49.18 --> 03:34:54.46 MREs I'm like you're sitting on this little concrete square right with little toilets here over and all of a sudden
03:34:54.46 --> 03:34:56.46 I just hear this like
03:34:56.46 --> 03:35:01.46 Like and I look down and I see these two hands man pulling this big pot of shit out from my
03:35:01.46 --> 03:35:08.06 I'm like oh my god Jesus like that was my first experience on back in Baga. I mean this is place like a medical spot like a spa
03:35:08.06 --> 03:35:14.22 I'm walking these gym there are world-class gyms at least three of them on Baga me and seriously with all this hardcore awesome
03:35:14.46 --> 03:35:15.96 Way to equipment. I mean
03:35:15.96 --> 03:35:20.62 Series like pack decks cable cry. I mean everything you could possibly imagine there's water coolers in every corner
03:35:20.62 --> 03:35:25.74 There's green bean coffee. There's burger king. There's salsa night. There's movie night. I'm like
03:35:25.74 --> 03:35:31.66 People that come to Baga. I'm should pay the military to go to Baga. I'm this place is awesome
03:35:31.66 --> 03:35:37.34 I just want to take my family here on vacation. It's so nice. I mean it really was nice and I'm just thinking like
03:35:38.30 --> 03:35:42.30 People that are like they're infantry staff members or staff officers
03:35:42.30 --> 03:35:46.62 They go to this depot. They make the same amount of combat pain that I do. Yeah. It's a totally different deployment
03:35:47.18 --> 03:35:48.22 It's it's
03:35:48.22 --> 03:35:49.82 Worlds
03:35:49.82 --> 03:35:52.62 It is it's a universes and I'm sorry like you know it
03:35:52.62 --> 03:35:56.22 So I write about the resentment right that we felt at the time
03:35:57.02 --> 03:36:01.50 I know it's not mature. I know it's not nuance and complex. It probably not right right
03:36:02.06 --> 03:36:06.94 But I only wrote it that way not because just because I have I felt in the moment all right
03:36:07.34 --> 03:36:09.98 I look back and I'm so thankful for all those guys now
03:36:09.98 --> 03:36:16.62 But the truth of the matter was is you get highly pissed this dudes making the same as I am and I got shot in the chest last
03:36:16.62 --> 03:36:17.90 Leak in my body arbor you know
03:36:17.90 --> 03:36:20.78 I mean there's a there's a qualitative difference in experience
03:36:20.78 --> 03:36:26.94 That the military does not recognize with pay and that pissed me off just upset me you see
03:36:27.74 --> 03:36:33.18 This deployment went down 2006 you said you started writing this in 2008. Yes luckily for me
03:36:33.50 --> 03:36:38.62 Lafen I didn't start writing extreme ownership until like 2014
03:36:39.18 --> 03:36:42.22 So we had enough time to like get over it
03:36:42.54 --> 03:36:43.90 One about friends
03:36:44.62 --> 03:36:49.26 I'm still like yeah, you know, I'm still like all fire blood on your boots
03:36:49.26 --> 03:36:56.06 I'm gonna give me a copy of an email that I had sent while I was in
03:36:57.50 --> 03:37:03.42 Ramadi to my Commodore who was a friend of mine who I had a great relationship with
03:37:03.98 --> 03:37:05.98 But I could believe that I wrote it
03:37:05.98 --> 03:37:10.70 I mean it was one of those is like I literally didn't care like hey, you know
03:37:10.70 --> 03:37:15.98 It was like a he had sent out an email and I sent he'd sent out like kind of a group wide email to all the officers
03:37:15.98 --> 03:37:17.98 You know asking for some feedback
03:37:17.98 --> 03:37:21.82 And I gave it to me and I I was a straight shooter, you know everyone knew as a straight shooter
03:37:21.82 --> 03:37:26.86 And like I said I had a great relationship with him, but like this guy told me the email that I sent
03:37:26.86 --> 03:37:31.10 I was like wow, you know, it started off with something along the line because you know
03:37:31.10 --> 03:37:36.46 He it was questioning hey how can we get more seals and like my opening line was we don't need more seals
03:37:36.46 --> 03:37:41.26 We need to better seals and tougher seals. I like that was my opening line. I was like okay
03:37:41.26 --> 03:37:46.62 That's a shock opening line. That's it everything I expected to say. Yeah, but I you know
03:37:46.62 --> 03:37:54.06 Probably not I wouldn't have addressed it the same way if you took me out of Ramadi like and and I was
03:37:54.70 --> 03:37:57.26 Sitting in a when you say a salsa night dance
03:37:57.98 --> 03:38:01.74 Would have been probably a little bit. Okay, here's some ways we could think about recruiting you know
03:38:01.74 --> 03:38:04.14 Wouldn't have been just come to a surprise of course
03:38:04.38 --> 03:38:08.30 So yeah, you you wrote this book you said you started right in 2008
03:38:08.86 --> 03:38:11.34 Yeah, actually started the writing process in 2007
03:38:11.34 --> 03:38:18.38 Like a back in summer to fresh you're surprisingly gentle then I mean I really wanted it to be a warts and all
03:38:18.38 --> 03:38:24.62 Story like my failures, but I mean look I got a piece of advice from John my co-author on this book and he said look
03:38:25.50 --> 03:38:31.90 This country is a wash of World War II memoirs written by generals that feel making feel like the war was just a chessboard
03:38:31.90 --> 03:38:37.98 Like I'm gonna over this unit here and we did this and the truth of the matter is you can we cannot write a book like that
03:38:37.98 --> 03:38:42.14 It has to be a warts and all blood and got type story and so that's what we set out to do yeah
03:38:42.14 --> 03:38:46.14 Well those are the kind of books that we don't cover on this podcast books by
03:38:46.94 --> 03:38:54.30 By the rear echelon like we literally I don't think I've covered I mean I covered patterns because patterns and I've covered some other senior generals
03:38:54.30 --> 03:39:00.70 From older times when you don't have any first person accounts from private's because a lot of times the private's weren't educated enough to write a book
03:39:00.70 --> 03:39:04.58 Right a few that are out there that I've definitely we've definitely nailed some of those
03:39:04.82 --> 03:39:06.82 we've got
03:39:06.82 --> 03:39:14.34 The Napoleonic foot soldier. Oh, yeah, that's a foot soldier. So yes, that's what this book comes across like you get you get it right
03:39:15.66 --> 03:39:20.34 So now you're on leave by the way, which people may not understand leave is absolutely mandatory
03:39:20.34 --> 03:39:25.74 When you're on a one year deployment the army. That's right. Yeah, you can't get out of it rest and relaxation leave
03:39:25.74 --> 03:39:29.10 there was a I didn't I didn't know that and the
03:39:29.50 --> 03:39:33.18 Commander of the first the 506 who was the best guy
03:39:33.18 --> 03:39:37.66 The like one of just the best combat leaders ever leaders period
03:39:38.26 --> 03:39:44.26 For one five of six. Yeah, first the five of six in Ramadi just told just an awesome guy and
03:39:45.90 --> 03:39:51.30 I didn't know that it was mandatory, but also he was on leave and I was kind of like well, that's that's kind of a
03:39:52.02 --> 03:39:53.30 That's kind of a let down
03:39:53.30 --> 03:39:56.24 You know I thought to myself what I can't believe he took leave because in the sealed teams
03:39:56.24 --> 03:40:00.66 We don't do that because we aren't short much shorter opponents anyways then someone's like oh, yeah, he's on leave
03:40:00.66 --> 03:40:06.46 That's interesting. I didn't think about that. Yeah, we are the ones who are for you too our deployments are generally
03:40:06.66 --> 03:40:13.42 Six seven months so we're not going on 14 60 month deployments like they do in the army and the Marine Corps is the same way the Marine Corps goes on like
03:40:13.42 --> 03:40:17.10 Six seven month deployments. You know, that's kind of they don't get as you they don't get mid-tore leave
03:40:17.10 --> 03:40:20.58 They don't get like only going for six months, bro. I mean you don't there's no forward it
03:40:20.58 --> 03:40:24.02 I mean I didn't have very really thought about this. Yeah. I guess if you're only gone six months
03:40:24.02 --> 03:40:26.02 Do you you don't get anything nothing?
03:40:26.02 --> 03:40:28.82 No, no, I don't know would be better
03:40:28.82 --> 03:40:33.86 I think a six month deployment with no leave would be better than a 16 month deployment with two weeks in the middle
03:40:33.86 --> 03:40:39.54 I would say that that's rough and even reading your your thing like there's no way I would have wanted to go on leave
03:40:39.54 --> 03:40:49.38 It would didn't I would have driven me crazy from an infinite number of ways, but just I don't want to taste like I don't want to taste
03:40:50.06 --> 03:40:56.86 Chocolate chip cookies. I know if they're not going to be like if I'm not going to have at least the whole chocolate chip cookie
03:40:56.86 --> 03:41:00.14 Yeah, I don't want to taste it. I don't want to just give me an mary
03:41:00.14 --> 03:41:03.18 I'll keep eating that. I don't want to know this other thing tastes like yeah, leave me in the suck
03:41:03.18 --> 03:41:06.58 I know don't don't take me out of the suck and expect me to want to go back to the suck
03:41:06.58 --> 03:41:11.74 So it was one of the hardest things ever. Yeah, I mean you're right about that. I can't even you know what they do in in
03:41:11.90 --> 03:41:13.26 Basic seal training
03:41:13.26 --> 03:41:17.90 We're going through this thing called hell week, which is like five days where you're up the whole time
03:41:17.90 --> 03:41:21.42 And it's called and wet miss more at some point during that they go okay guys
03:41:21.42 --> 03:41:23.42 You know what we've pushed you guys too hard and
03:41:23.42 --> 03:41:29.22 And the the captain he says you know we need to we need to get you guys arrested
03:41:29.30 --> 03:41:34.46 So it's our fault look go change in a dry uniforms and we're gonna put you guys to bed
03:41:34.46 --> 03:41:38.50 You guys are gonna get six hours because we've we shouldn't have done this we shouldn't have pushed you guys like this and you're like whoa
03:41:38.50 --> 03:41:39.50 Okay, cool
03:41:39.50 --> 03:41:44.98 So you get dry clothes and then they put you in bed and this is one of the times where you get to sleep
03:41:45.30 --> 03:41:50.78 But you're you don't go to sleep for how for six hours you're gonna sleep for about 15 minutes and then they come in and they're lying
03:41:50.78 --> 03:41:53.98 They're just but what's interesting is what's interesting is
03:41:54.46 --> 03:41:59.74 So many people quit right then because you're cold wet miserable for like a day and a half
03:41:59.98 --> 03:42:04.54 Maybe two days then they tell you okay sorry that was that was a mistake
03:42:04.70 --> 03:42:08.94 We need to give you guys a rest they get you dry they get you warm they get you sleeping
03:42:09.66 --> 03:42:14.94 Only so they can wake you up and put you right back in the cold water and so many people quit right then God
03:42:14.94 --> 03:42:17.98 Man, this is a fascinating parallel because it is because
03:42:17.98 --> 03:42:22.98 I mean you're you're speaking to some deep fundamental truth of the human condition
03:42:23.42 --> 03:42:27.34 Yet leave his mandatory for army and I have to tell you man
03:42:27.34 --> 03:42:31.50 I didn't want to leave it was it was terrible right?
03:42:32.14 --> 03:42:39.14 I went home I could there was restory laxation like what right yeah like you there's no relaxing at all
03:42:39.14 --> 03:42:45.66 And then going back though was the hardest thing it was so hard right?
03:42:45.66 --> 03:42:51.98 It was just so challenging so there is something to that. Oh, yeah, yeah, and it's you know what's amazing the suck
03:42:51.98 --> 03:42:55.58 Yeah, there would do it. Yes, exactly stay in the suck keep me in the suck
03:42:55.58 --> 03:43:00.14 And you know what's amazing though is it with there was there was not more A walls yeah that is shocking
03:43:00.14 --> 03:43:04.22 I mean for real that is shocking well I guess it's partly because we have an all volunteer force
03:43:04.62 --> 03:43:08.78 Yeah, and people know what they're doing I think that is I think that is a major component of it
03:43:08.78 --> 03:43:10.78 If it was a all-draft force
03:43:10.78 --> 03:43:17.58 The A1 number would be significantly higher. I think oh no though man I talked to the leaders that I talked to you from the Vietnam more the
03:43:17.74 --> 03:43:23.50 Drafties were awesome unless you were crappy leader and then they were horrible and guess what everyone that worked for you is horrible. Yes, I talked
03:43:23.50 --> 03:43:25.50 Yeah, interesting
03:43:26.06 --> 03:43:29.26 So you are in ocean city Maryland. Yes
03:43:29.98 --> 03:43:32.94 That's where my family's gone for the vacation
03:43:33.74 --> 03:43:37.82 So this is just hitting every every damn sentimental
03:43:37.82 --> 03:43:41.58 Thought that you have is all getting hit I went back to the book here
03:43:42.14 --> 03:43:44.38 What go ahead? No, yes, you're back
03:43:44.94 --> 03:43:48.86 You're hitting the nail on the head man. Yeah, everything that I've experienced my entire childhood
03:43:49.74 --> 03:43:55.26 Coupled with this shame and guilt of leaving my troops. It was just how all is horrible
03:43:56.14 --> 03:43:58.54 Oh, and I had to try to pretend like it was oh
03:43:58.54 --> 03:44:00.54 That's a thing like your family like no
03:44:00.54 --> 03:44:05.98 Yeah, many go for fun. Which it is you know because I always win but it wasn't fun when I was on leave you know
03:44:05.98 --> 03:44:12.06 I rose from the bed and went to the open window my family had rented a place on Maryland sure an honor of my temporary homecon
03:44:12.06 --> 03:44:18.14 Mean we'd be there for a week then I would return to the war the saltier smelled divine I closed my eyes and filled my lungs with each
03:44:18.14 --> 03:44:22.54 Exail I tried to purge my mind to the foul odors. I had stowed away with every
03:44:22.54 --> 03:44:24.14 Afghan breath
03:44:24.14 --> 03:44:28.14 Burned flesh white phosphorus and steaming bodies rent the sunder
03:44:28.78 --> 03:44:32.14 filth sewage mold and decay and
03:44:32.14 --> 03:44:36.46 Then you go on but at the same time I felt disconnected unplugged
03:44:37.02 --> 03:44:39.02 from my high-vid Burma
03:44:39.42 --> 03:44:46.46 Burma now all my instincts telegraphed that something had gone terribly wrong and I wasn't there to help out
03:44:48.38 --> 03:44:53.10 Somewhere on the far side of the planet. I imagine the platoon cleaning weapons and getting ready for child
03:44:53.50 --> 03:44:55.50 I loved being home
03:44:56.46 --> 03:44:58.46 I hated being home
03:44:58.46 --> 03:45:03.98 My folks appeared in the kitchen and my grandmother wished them good morning and went back to watching fox news
03:45:03.98 --> 03:45:06.46 Savoring every bite of my home cooked breakfast
03:45:07.10 --> 03:45:16.30 The little things matter the most after combat the news anchor began talking about two fox reporters who'd been kidnapped at gunpoint the day before in Gaza
03:45:17.98 --> 03:45:21.58 Then the news ticker at the bottom of the screen caught my attention
03:45:21.58 --> 03:45:26.30 American soldier killed by enemy mines strike and eastern Afghanistan
03:45:28.22 --> 03:45:33.66 The wires inside my head were screaming now. I stared at the screen and listed all the reasons why this couldn't have happened to anyone
03:45:33.66 --> 03:45:39.66 I knew the outlaws were tiny unit just a poll tuned there were thousands of U.S. troops fighting in eastern Afghanistan
03:45:39.66 --> 03:45:43.02 the chances that was one of my men were astronomically small
03:45:43.02 --> 03:45:49.74 Then you obviously run get your laptop
03:45:50.38 --> 03:45:57.02 I sat down and started my laptop as soon as I logged into Yahoo instant messenger a conversation box popped up it was rally
03:45:58.22 --> 03:46:00.06 Hacer rally everything okay
03:46:01.34 --> 03:46:03.34 Actually no what's wrong?
03:46:04.70 --> 03:46:06.46 I received no immediate reply
03:46:07.90 --> 03:46:09.66 I waited in dreadful suspense
03:46:09.66 --> 03:46:11.66 And then finally
03:46:13.90 --> 03:46:15.90 Cole is dead
03:46:20.38 --> 03:46:22.94 Rally sent a file the download took forever
03:46:23.90 --> 03:46:29.50 When it finally finished I opened it up and saw a photograph of one of our home v's blown to broken junk
03:46:35.26 --> 03:46:37.26 I had a
03:46:37.26 --> 03:46:39.26 I had a dream that day
03:46:41.02 --> 03:46:45.82 Yeah, I don't know if you all believe in this sort of thing but I had a dream that day that something was wrong
03:46:46.38 --> 03:46:50.46 And I've gassed in I just I could not sleep it plagued me all night
03:46:50.94 --> 03:46:53.58 Was there a dream about being overrun all this other stuff?
03:46:53.58 --> 03:46:58.94 It's just hard sometimes to get centered when you come back from combat especially on our and you know you're going back
03:47:00.70 --> 03:47:02.70 But just something in me
03:47:03.66 --> 03:47:06.22 Was screaming as something isn't right something's not right?
03:47:06.22 --> 03:47:10.54 I don't and I sort of just wrote it office like hey, you know you just don't want to be here
03:47:10.54 --> 03:47:15.58 You want to be back with the guys like just sort of try let it go try to let your guard down right try to relax
03:47:15.58 --> 03:47:16.94 But I couldn't let it go
03:47:16.94 --> 03:47:21.34 I remember waking up that morning having pancakes my mom makes amazing pancakes
03:47:21.34 --> 03:47:23.42 That's like our thing would go on vacation right?
03:47:23.42 --> 03:47:25.82 So I'm just like crushing some pancakes or whatever
03:47:26.62 --> 03:47:30.30 And I'm like watching Fox news and I still could not shake this feeling
03:47:30.86 --> 03:47:33.98 Something was wrong and I see that ticker and
03:47:33.98 --> 03:47:37.34 Immediately I knew and knew it was my birthday
03:47:37.66 --> 03:47:41.10 100% just knew it in my heart of hearts and I run over
03:47:41.10 --> 03:47:48.86 I mean this is back in 2006 where Wi-Fi wasn't everywhere you know what I mean like I had to go find a place that I'd Wi-Fi some coffee shop across the street
03:47:48.86 --> 03:47:50.86 I got my like my laptop
03:47:51.42 --> 03:47:57.74 I sprint across the street to get there hook up find out that I lost one of my soldiers in my only two weeks my two weeks that I was gone
03:47:58.86 --> 03:48:01.82 Was just one of the most devastating experiences in my life because
03:48:01.82 --> 03:48:09.58 It by this time I realized that you know sending I'd seen the toll that the email is taking on my dad first hand now
03:48:09.58 --> 03:48:14.94 Like he didn't talk about it. He didn't complain to me about it, but I saw it. You know I could feel it and so
03:48:16.30 --> 03:48:20.14 By this time in the deployment I just I just sucked it up
03:48:20.14 --> 03:48:23.34 You know I found out that they called I had to keep it a secret for the rest of the time
03:48:24.22 --> 03:48:27.34 You know and my my I think my family knew something was wrong
03:48:27.66 --> 03:48:29.42 They didn't really ask me any questions about it
03:48:29.42 --> 03:48:36.06 But like we were going many golf and having family dinners walking on the board walk or I just had to just not say or about it. It was just
03:48:37.42 --> 03:48:44.14 It was just the hardest thing in the world man and Cole was just such a great guy like had a new born baby before we deployed
03:48:44.70 --> 03:48:48.30 The reason why he gained all that weight is it was simply he was gained all the weight because he was
03:48:48.94 --> 03:48:53.90 Came simply simply way during the pregnancy and he couldn't shake he couldn't lose it and so
03:48:54.22 --> 03:48:57.58 He got to stay back see the birth of his kid. I remember her bedtime commander said yeah
03:48:57.58 --> 03:48:59.98 We're gonna let you stay back. You know take care of your family
03:49:00.38 --> 03:49:04.78 Have this baby because when you come to Afghanistan we need you 100% focus on the mission
03:49:05.42 --> 03:49:10.86 So thank god he got to stay back and and watch his baby be born and come back. I've got to the base over weight
03:49:11.42 --> 03:49:14.46 He couldn't really like going patrol with us because he was overweight
03:49:14.46 --> 03:49:16.86 But he took it and stride he didn't get the jacked
03:49:16.94 --> 03:49:20.22 He looked for other ways to help you know like we'd get back from base
03:49:20.22 --> 03:49:23.42 He'd run over the trucks start grabbing throw and MREs in if we needed a marries
03:49:23.42 --> 03:49:26.30 He looked for a way to be functional man and the soon just a door to him
03:49:26.30 --> 03:49:32.14 And finally ends up in the gym losing all this weight gets these stupid big bird shoes think of makes him run fast and stuff
03:49:32.14 --> 03:49:35.42 They didn't use this a character man. It's really funny
03:49:35.90 --> 03:49:42.54 Finally loses all the weight and you know I left on leave like something like August 12th his first patrol was August 15th
03:49:42.54 --> 03:49:44.54 He was killed August 16th
03:49:45.58 --> 03:49:51.26 Yeah, it was just and I I to this day it's just the worst it's just I missed his funeral
03:49:51.50 --> 03:49:54.22 I missed his I missed the you know
03:49:54.22 --> 03:49:59.26 That's the salute the funeral the moral service the bagpipes the you know
03:50:01.02 --> 03:50:05.74 His casket being flown from a Mal back to Bogram. It was just it was just the words. It was just the worst experience
03:50:05.74 --> 03:50:07.74 You know just to not be there
03:50:08.22 --> 03:50:09.74 You know as a leader like
03:50:09.74 --> 03:50:11.66 You know you always want to make sure that you're there
03:50:11.98 --> 03:50:16.86 You know where the contact is heaviest right that's my you know on the battlefield where the contact is heaviest
03:50:16.86 --> 03:50:21.26 But it's not sometimes it's not just enemy contact sometimes it's emotional and psychological contact as well
03:50:21.26 --> 03:50:25.98 The leader has to be there has to be it cannot be a detached must be involved and
03:50:26.62 --> 03:50:31.10 This was one of those moments for me and I'm like I was screaming inside and like God damn it
03:50:31.10 --> 03:50:35.10 This is one of my but two needs me the most I need to be there for them
03:50:35.10 --> 03:50:39.90 I need to be subt struggling through this with them and I I totally missed the entire thing by that time
03:50:39.90 --> 03:50:41.90 I got back to the base
03:50:41.90 --> 03:50:45.90 Cole on the base. I mean never be forgotten. He's his his name was just
03:50:45.90 --> 03:50:52.46 Been painted on our walls just one of the fallen that we had lost under the appointment and it just killed me inside not to be able to be a part of it
03:50:53.26 --> 03:50:55.98 You know and it would end up being my truck you know
03:50:56.54 --> 03:50:59.18 My truck that was a tag. I mean there's a whole story behind it
03:50:59.18 --> 03:51:03.98 Which is sure we're gonna get into but it ended up being my truck that was a tag was a targeted tag at the command vehicle
03:51:03.98 --> 03:51:05.34 So it's just
03:51:05.34 --> 03:51:11.26 It's just sucked what I was out there that was that was that was your truck in the line of March that got hit
03:51:11.26 --> 03:51:14.06 Yeah, and that's what he was in what position was he in in the vehicle
03:51:14.06 --> 03:51:17.58 He would he was sitting behind the driver so
03:51:18.62 --> 03:51:22.38 When I was on leave Greece and took over the truck commander position for the command truck
03:51:22.38 --> 03:51:27.82 Which is this you know typically in a convoy the way that we did it is I was right behind the point man in the truck so
03:51:29.74 --> 03:51:34.14 Would you be in the lead truck? I wouldn't be in the lead truck. I'd be in the truck right behind the truck
03:51:34.14 --> 03:51:39.18 So Chris telling us yeah, so I was sitting in a TC spot directly next to the driver calls
03:51:39.18 --> 03:51:45.66 I was sitting behind the driver Chris Brown was my gunner and I have a pinholder router in the truck behind me
03:51:46.06 --> 03:51:51.02 So I was only a Christmas in that truck full full in that roll, but it was that truck that was hit
03:51:51.26 --> 03:51:53.26 It was a targeted attack
03:52:01.74 --> 03:52:03.74 So you get back
03:52:03.74 --> 03:52:05.74 Um
03:52:06.86 --> 03:52:12.46 Your back in Burmel hey sir, I need to talk to you. Greece and said to me as I entered our hooch his room is across the hall for mine
03:52:12.46 --> 03:52:17.26 He was supposed to get evacuated back to Bogram so his head wound could be treated
03:52:18.30 --> 03:52:23.50 Instead he refused to leave the men and continue to lead them after the age station at Fox
03:52:23.50 --> 03:52:27.90 Or later, no had patched him up as best they could and those were wounds that he got from that same idea
03:52:27.90 --> 03:52:35.02 Yeah, he got he it's it's I think this is a second or third purple heart on this deployment we just come back
03:52:35.50 --> 03:52:38.22 From my first patrol since I had returned from leave
03:52:40.70 --> 03:52:43.58 Sir what I'm about to tell you cannot be mentioned to anyone
03:52:44.62 --> 03:52:48.54 His preface caught me off guard okay, I said cautiously. It's about one of our interpreters
03:52:49.26 --> 03:52:55.10 He had my attention now quietly he began to talk unbeknownst to us some top secret national level assets
03:52:55.10 --> 03:52:59.42 had been tracking unusual communications coming from our area over the past several months
03:52:59.42 --> 03:53:02.06 They had narrowed those transmissions down to Fobramel
03:53:03.34 --> 03:53:09.50 Somebody on post had been using our sat phones to contact an Iranian bomb making cell operating out of a
03:53:09.50 --> 03:53:11.66 Madrasa just over the Pakistani border
03:53:13.02 --> 03:53:15.26 We had an enemy mole in our midst
03:53:16.78 --> 03:53:21.26 You see if fell under suspicion he'd been observed asking questions he should have been asking
03:53:21.26 --> 03:53:27.82 He had often wanted to know where we were going before we left the wire something that had annoyed us throughout the deployment
03:53:28.22 --> 03:53:33.26 A quiet investigation it revealed that he was the only local national on base who could have had knowledge of the
03:53:33.26 --> 03:53:37.18 Platoon's deterdestination plus grease and a caught him talking on a phone
03:53:37.50 --> 03:53:42.38 Introducing himself with a different name to whoever was on the other end of the connection when grease and said
03:53:42.70 --> 03:53:48.14 Hey, I thought your name was you Seth our head-terpe offered a wide suspicious grin and replied
03:53:48.14 --> 03:53:50.14 That's just my stage name
03:53:50.14 --> 03:53:52.14 grease and finish the story
03:53:52.14 --> 03:53:57.50 Captain die is going to take him to Oregon, E as I said Oregon a yeah, Oregon E later today to arrest him
03:53:57.82 --> 03:54:02.38 Nobody can know about this we can't risk spooky spooking you Seth and causing him to bolt
03:54:02.94 --> 03:54:05.90 I want to go to Oregon E I said in a fortified furious voice
03:54:06.62 --> 03:54:11.82 Greasing growled the fuck no sir your way too close to this so am I let Captain die handle this
03:54:12.46 --> 03:54:16.86 He was right as the new sink in my own responsibility in this disaster became apparent
03:54:16.86 --> 03:54:21.50 I had become complacent with the cozy nature of you Seth's relationships with the men
03:54:22.46 --> 03:54:27.18 He'd been too close to them for many months and every time I'd seen him around the barracks hanging out with them
03:54:27.42 --> 03:54:33.58 It had rankled me grease and a noted it too urging me to put it put a stop to it and although I had mentioned it to the
03:54:33.58 --> 03:54:37.42 Patoon impassing I'd not done so with any conviction
03:54:38.46 --> 03:54:45.18 When it continued I should have put my foot down hard and ended it fratinization with a local national no matter how much you is trusted
03:54:45.18 --> 03:54:48.54 Was an operational security breach plain and simple
03:54:49.10 --> 03:54:52.94 Even more damning was as use of satellite phones that never should have happened
03:54:53.82 --> 03:55:01.02 Though we had told him he couldn't use them. He still had access to soldiers who worked in the operation center and he could get his hands on the phones whenever he wanted
03:55:02.30 --> 03:55:07.34 It had always seemed like a minor problem and my plate had been so full with that dealing with you
03:55:07.34 --> 03:55:10.06 Seth's behavior it ended up on the bottom of my priority list
03:55:10.70 --> 03:55:13.34 I'd never gotten around to dealing with it and now
03:55:13.34 --> 03:55:19.66 What grease and told me revealed the consequences of that failure it had gotten cold killed
03:55:20.94 --> 03:55:26.14 No, I had gotten cold killed this was not on the men this was non-greason
03:55:27.50 --> 03:55:29.50 This was my cross to bear
03:55:31.82 --> 03:55:36.86 I don't remember much of the morning after that. I know I went to my room to change out my filthy uniform
03:55:36.94 --> 03:55:43.10 I know I felt my strength failing me as I faced the totality of my guilt another part of me slipped away
03:55:43.10 --> 03:55:46.46 And died I hadn't didn't even have the will to fight for at this time
03:55:48.06 --> 03:55:50.06 The war had sucked me dry
03:55:55.98 --> 03:55:57.98 So this
03:55:57.98 --> 03:56:05.58 Judas in the purest sense of the word Judas yourself had had betrayed everyone honestly
03:56:05.58 --> 03:56:11.50 um, they knew in my mind I was wondering okay I wonder how like how they knew
03:56:12.14 --> 03:56:14.94 Like okay they got some very good evidence
03:56:15.26 --> 03:56:17.82 But even in the back of my mind I was thinking still like you're gonna
03:56:18.38 --> 03:56:24.86 You're gonna go you how do you really know and then I read this later that day cap and die assembled a patrol from
03:56:24.86 --> 03:56:27.18 Part of my platoon and part of the headquarters element
03:56:27.18 --> 03:56:32.46 You said what's assigned to be the turf he suspected nothing and climbed on board one of the humbese at Oregon E
03:56:32.46 --> 03:56:36.14 He was confronted with the evidence against him at first even night everything
03:56:36.46 --> 03:56:42.22 But when the sat phone was mentioned he laughingly confessed yes, yes, you got me I did it
03:56:44.30 --> 03:56:50.78 Is attitude earned him a face plan on the hood of the humbese our men zip cuffed him and pulled him into the battalion detention center later that night
03:56:50.78 --> 03:56:55.82 He was phone phoned a bagram in any other time in the hands of any other army
03:56:56.14 --> 03:56:58.14 You said body would never have been found
03:56:59.02 --> 03:57:01.66 He'd have been dispatched and dumped his corpse left
03:57:01.66 --> 03:57:07.26 For scavengers nobody would have known or cured that an enemy spy had vanished
03:57:07.98 --> 03:57:09.02 vanished
03:57:09.02 --> 03:57:11.02 Discipline was the only thing that saved his life
03:57:11.74 --> 03:57:15.50 Instead of a bullet to the brain he faced due process and a prison cell
03:57:16.46 --> 03:57:19.74 In the days ahead I wondered if that was a weakness or a strength
03:57:19.74 --> 03:57:28.78 There's a certain elegance to outlaw justice besides the enemy would have afforded us no mercy had the roles been reversed
03:57:32.94 --> 03:57:34.94 And then later you find out that
03:57:35.98 --> 03:57:37.98 He actually
03:57:37.98 --> 03:57:43.82 Also was the one that got Abdul Kil. Yes, he he was responsible for the assassination of Abdul
03:57:44.06 --> 03:57:48.14 Bating him outside the wire had a hand in the night letters just so he could have sent into the head
03:57:48.14 --> 03:57:50.54 Turb and ingratiate himself to
03:57:51.34 --> 03:58:00.06 The sensitivity of some of our mission sense it mentioned sensitive intelligence and so this is this this is a hundred percent on me
03:58:00.78 --> 03:58:02.78 Hundred percent I mean
03:58:02.78 --> 03:58:07.18 Throughout the course of the deployment like we get there even myself or like oh my gosh
03:58:07.18 --> 03:58:12.46 This is a totally different culture look we're having fun. We're having tea together. We're friends we're out there serving together. You know
03:58:13.50 --> 03:58:17.66 After a while these turps would show up for our convoy briefs and they'd listen to an increasing bill like
03:58:17.66 --> 03:58:21.34 Hey, they can't be having these guys listen to our convoy briefs and I'd say okay. I talked to the squad
03:58:21.34 --> 03:58:23.34 They just were about it but again no conviction
03:58:24.54 --> 03:58:28.70 You know we'd have interpreters for a while sitting in my truck and the command truck to listen
03:58:28.70 --> 03:58:31.10 So I could react in real time to the I-com chatter
03:58:31.10 --> 03:58:34.22 We were like you can see we'd listen to the enemy and I'd hear about it. I'd call one fire
03:58:34.70 --> 03:58:39.02 But he was also hearing sensitive combo coming back from me on the taxat and stuff like that
03:58:40.54 --> 03:58:42.38 Greece was like you can't do that you can't do that
03:58:42.38 --> 03:58:47.90 So we moved into a different truck but again I never addressed this issue with any real conviction and
03:58:49.66 --> 03:58:51.66 And because of that
03:58:51.66 --> 03:58:54.70 He coordinate with this Iranian ID cell
03:58:55.26 --> 03:59:00.46 They he knew exactly where we were going what O. P. were setting on the ID eight digit grid
03:59:00.46 --> 03:59:02.86 He knew where my truck would be that provided the greatest
03:59:04.30 --> 03:59:08.86 It was just the best position for the command truck to be we'd been at this location before so we'd know
03:59:08.86 --> 03:59:15.66 So he seated the area with a couple of different plastic Italian TC6 anti tank mines
03:59:15.66 --> 03:59:19.66 So even we had these metal detectors for that purpose to detect mines
03:59:20.14 --> 03:59:23.34 There was more metal in a pack of cigarettes in a reason this mine and
03:59:24.06 --> 03:59:27.90 my truck with coal in it rolled over that mine
03:59:28.94 --> 03:59:31.58 Totally destroyed it killed coal in an instant
03:59:31.98 --> 03:59:37.66 wounded dock pantoha for a second time wounded is grease him for the second or third time blue cult wall outside of the turret
03:59:37.66 --> 03:59:44.86 He was wounded in another time and it was just an absolute disaster and it was a hundred percent on my
03:59:44.86 --> 03:59:50.22 Failure to address this specific issue and failure to protect operational security around
03:59:50.78 --> 03:59:52.38 mission sensitive
03:59:52.38 --> 03:59:54.38 things and
03:59:54.78 --> 03:59:58.62 You know it it just God it just bothers me to this day
03:59:59.34 --> 04:00:00.78 You know because
04:00:00.78 --> 04:00:03.02 You know man regret is life's worst poison
04:00:03.02 --> 04:00:08.22 It just is it each it you have it each it you forever for the rest of your life you never want to look back in your life and
04:00:08.70 --> 04:00:12.78 Say the word should should is like one of my least favorite words in the English line was yes
04:00:12.78 --> 04:00:17.34 Sir, I sure I sure I should be able to do that note or can you do it or can you not do it because you can't do it
04:00:17.34 --> 04:00:21.74 I'm gonna find somebody else who can I hate the word should my kids say yeah, I should know
04:00:21.98 --> 04:00:24.46 I don't want to hear should yes or no I hate that word
04:00:24.46 --> 04:00:28.62 Well, it I also hated because I don't want to ever look back on my life and said and say
04:00:29.66 --> 04:00:32.46 God I should have done some I should have done this differently
04:00:32.46 --> 04:00:34.46 You know
04:00:34.46 --> 04:00:39.74 And I have to say that with regard to Cole I mean his death is on me no one else but me and
04:00:40.54 --> 04:00:42.14 His death
04:00:42.14 --> 04:00:45.58 Rest solely at my feet and I've got to live with that pain for the rest of my life
04:00:45.58 --> 04:00:51.98 Losing a soldier when I knew it could have been preventable that I'd you know I think I look back I look back on it and I think I just
04:00:53.18 --> 04:00:56.22 You know part of me just wanted to be liked by the guys you know what I mean
04:00:56.22 --> 04:01:02.14 Like they thought it was they thought it was cool to go sit and have tea with the interpreters and stuff and
04:01:03.10 --> 04:01:07.74 I just didn't want to you know I think that was it I think part of me just didn't want to make that hard decision
04:01:07.74 --> 04:01:11.74 I didn't want to take that away from him. I wanted to be cool. I wanted to be liked and
04:01:12.54 --> 04:01:17.98 Ultimately that's what that that right there is what got one of my soldier skills and something like I said
04:01:17.98 --> 04:01:19.98 I have to live with her rest of my life
04:01:20.22 --> 04:01:22.86 Every day I think of that every day I wish I could have done something different
04:01:22.86 --> 04:01:24.86 I
04:01:25.74 --> 04:01:29.34 talked about that on a recent podcast like this idea
04:01:31.34 --> 04:01:34.46 That and it's the same thing that you and I've been talking about because
04:01:35.10 --> 04:01:42.14 This idea of like I'm gonna be friends with people and which I clearly said and will freely say that I absolutely had friends
04:01:43.34 --> 04:01:48.94 In all every unit I was ever with I had real good friends up when I was a junior guy
04:01:48.94 --> 04:01:55.10 Guess what when I was a junior guy when I was the youngest guy in my petun I had great friends that were what we call khakis
04:01:55.10 --> 04:02:02.38 You know the good weather they were the chief for the assistant petun commander the petun commander like they were my real true friends like real legit friends
04:02:03.58 --> 04:02:10.14 And that was when I was really young so I I always had it there, but man the bleed over
04:02:11.10 --> 04:02:17.66 The mistake that people make where they where they say you know what and I know the feeling I know this uncomfortable feeling
04:02:17.66 --> 04:02:19.66 of
04:02:20.06 --> 04:02:21.34 You know
04:02:21.34 --> 04:02:28.94 The guys want to do this and I don't think it's the right thing to do, but I don't feel strongly enough about it that I'm actually gonna say anything and this to me
04:02:29.82 --> 04:02:35.18 Like I said I had a real advantage because I was older and I'd been in the teams for a long time
04:02:36.22 --> 04:02:39.22 You know, I had a lot of experience in the teams
04:02:39.34 --> 04:02:46.30 So it was easier for me as a junior officer to hold the line. I didn't always and I look back and I can tell you a thousand stories
04:02:46.30 --> 04:02:52.22 of times where I should have done something better than I did and I didn't and I should have and it was a mistake
04:02:53.26 --> 04:02:58.30 And I explained that to these young officers when I talk to the officers now I'm like you're the guy
04:02:58.86 --> 04:03:02.62 You're the one that has to make these hard decisions and you know what
04:03:03.34 --> 04:03:05.34 This is the part that's that's good
04:03:06.22 --> 04:03:08.70 For them to understand it's counterintuitive
04:03:08.70 --> 04:03:18.06 What's counterintuitive when you're in a leadership position and you actually say hey guys, we're not doing that you're afraid that they're not gonna like you
04:03:18.06 --> 04:03:21.50 You're afraid that they're not gonna respect you. They actually respect you more
04:03:22.06 --> 04:03:27.02 It's true. They actually respect you more like you know looking back now if you're to go and guys
04:03:27.02 --> 04:03:33.98 Hey listen this is Opsick we're not playing I'm not gonna have four nationals know our routes. It's not happening
04:03:34.54 --> 04:03:37.90 Everyone in that particular gun hey bosses on it. You know what I mean
04:03:37.90 --> 04:03:45.26 But we don't know that it's easy to look back on sites 2020 man. Hey, you're you're a hundred percent right
04:03:46.78 --> 04:03:51.42 hundred percent right you know and I think part of me it was just like you know
04:03:52.86 --> 04:03:57.90 You laid it out there perfectly like the guys really want to do this but I know this ain't the right thing
04:03:58.54 --> 04:04:02.14 And maybe 99% of the time if I don't say something
04:04:03.34 --> 04:04:07.10 It might be okay. It's no big deal. You know, but it's that one percent of the time
04:04:07.10 --> 04:04:11.10 Or if you don't say something in tragedy strikes and then you know
04:04:11.10 --> 04:04:13.10 I when I talk to young officers about it
04:04:13.10 --> 04:04:18.30 I'd say the exact same thing that you do the buck stops with you you are the guy
04:04:18.70 --> 04:04:22.78 Do not seek popularly or popularly for popularly sake
04:04:23.02 --> 04:04:28.62 You know be the leader be the strong leader that your men know need and deserve and that's the counter and two to part
04:04:28.62 --> 04:04:31.02 The counter and two to part is that if you
04:04:31.02 --> 04:04:39.66 Do if you hold the line the your respect actually goes up now. Can you go over water that? Yes, you absolutely can and everyone can hate you because you just and it happened
04:04:39.66 --> 04:04:47.10 It happens but yeah, but the other thing I think was playing against you in this situation is
04:04:52.22 --> 04:04:59.26 It kind of doesn't seem like that could really happen. You know what I mean like I look at some things that I experience in combat
04:04:59.26 --> 04:05:04.06 I'm like you know if somebody would have told me that that could actually happen
04:05:04.30 --> 04:05:08.70 I would have said it's like it's like you watch in a movie. You'll yeah, but that would never happen
04:05:08.94 --> 04:05:13.66 Right that could never actually happen and it seems like that's a situation where you're like listen
04:05:13.66 --> 04:05:15.66 What are the chances that of all the
04:05:16.62 --> 04:05:21.18 Thousands of people that could be assigned to us out here. We're gonna get this this
04:05:21.82 --> 04:05:27.66 Spy right a spy that's what's gonna happen that has access to Iranians like you can't
04:05:27.66 --> 04:05:31.34 Yeah, if you wrote a book about that you'd be like okay, that's a cool plot for a movie. I know
04:05:31.66 --> 04:05:34.62 But in our minds we're like hey, and that's why I
04:05:34.86 --> 04:05:39.26 Reach to point and I'll tell you I reach to point. I can't really talk about what happened
04:05:39.26 --> 04:05:41.66 But I had some intel that was
04:05:42.38 --> 04:05:46.62 Not the way it should be and I learned that lesson one time and
04:05:47.02 --> 04:05:49.02 From that point on I
04:05:49.26 --> 04:05:50.30 Never
04:05:50.30 --> 04:05:56.14 Douaded that these things could go the way they did and I and I all these little suspicions that I thought maybe
04:05:56.14 --> 04:06:01.74 And it happened to me luckily on my first deployment to Iraq was like okay, yeah, I dropped the ball on that one
04:06:01.74 --> 04:06:07.74 We got away with it. It'll never happen again. You know, so I think that's another thing that was playing against you is
04:06:09.10 --> 04:06:12.14 It seems kind of like far-fetched unrealistic
04:06:12.14 --> 04:06:16.62 You got James Bond. Well, it does you know Afghan James Bond and you're well, you know
04:06:16.62 --> 04:06:21.10 And the thing is is I think it's even more nuanced than that. I think he was he
04:06:21.10 --> 04:06:26.70 You know, maybe for a time he was a legit interpreter. You know worked with Americans for five years
04:06:27.10 --> 04:06:28.30 You know, and I think
04:06:28.94 --> 04:06:36.06 He just was unhappy with his pay and the enemy said they were gonna pay him more and the guy's trying to feed his family and these people are
04:06:36.62 --> 04:06:38.62 Perpetual fence-sitters like
04:06:38.62 --> 04:06:46.30 You know, it's the graveyard of empires. They're that sort of attitude is ingrained into the soul of every tribe in the country of Afghanistan and so
04:06:47.34 --> 04:06:48.14 I
04:06:48.14 --> 04:06:52.86 Think that he just flipped and his flipping
04:06:53.58 --> 04:06:58.54 Was more of a cultural thing and less of a lot. I mean, it was a loyalty thing to us right, but to him it's just like
04:06:59.10 --> 04:07:03.82 Business is usual that other peace plan against you. I yeah, I guess we don't do that
04:07:03.82 --> 04:07:08.14 I don't get yeah, we don't write you that I didn't it didn't even register with me
04:07:08.14 --> 04:07:10.14 Although it should have because
04:07:10.30 --> 04:07:13.02 You know, you have a dual telling me literally
04:07:13.42 --> 04:07:16.94 You know, you got to say I'll watch this guy. Keep an eye on this guy. It's guys all about the money
04:07:16.94 --> 04:07:21.82 You know, and again, I'm just thinking like well, I know a thousand guys like that that are all about the money. They're not gonna like
04:07:22.86 --> 04:07:26.62 Turn on you and then you look at the war since I've been home and
04:07:27.26 --> 04:07:31.82 God, man the war is a wash with green on blue incidents. It happens all the time
04:07:32.22 --> 04:07:37.34 But to me in the moment as a young inexperienced leader who wanted to be popular didn't want to make the heart decision
04:07:37.34 --> 04:07:39.74 Maybe just consciously or unconsciously blew it off
04:07:40.54 --> 04:07:46.70 It bit me in the ass, you know, and it and it got one of my guys killed and got four of them wounded and it was just it just is
04:07:46.70 --> 04:07:48.70 the worst feeling in the world, you know
04:07:50.22 --> 04:07:54.38 Well the good thing is you're in here right now and you wrote this book to teach these lessons to young
04:07:54.94 --> 04:07:59.02 young jails that are out there and n'sios that are out there that have to hold the line
04:08:05.02 --> 04:08:07.02 Going back to the book
04:08:07.02 --> 04:08:12.14 Enough was enough lieutenant Colonel toner coordinated a battalion size mission to clear and this again
04:08:12.14 --> 04:08:16.54 So this is jumping now we're on page 32 of this whatever this book
04:08:17.34 --> 04:08:22.78 Because now we're getting to a point where you've been through all this crap over and over and over again and the enemies
04:08:23.10 --> 04:08:27.10 They're getting theirs. I mean you guys are kicking their ass, but as battalion
04:08:28.14 --> 04:08:31.66 The enemy is their hostile look we had taken in that year
04:08:32.78 --> 04:08:37.34 We took over three or four thousand rockets and at this point this is around
04:08:37.74 --> 04:08:41.58 October and November timeframe they were hitting us with one 22 millimeter rockets
04:08:41.58 --> 04:08:43.58 I don't know if you if you know what that looks like
04:08:43.74 --> 04:08:49.66 Those are six foot long rockets freaking nightmare. It's the only one that has ever been used with a launcher and
04:08:49.66 --> 04:08:53.10 Afghanistan and we could not find them in every single day
04:08:53.34 --> 04:09:00.78 One 22 is repounding our base we fired more artillery that year and Afghanistan trying to find this one 22
04:09:01.34 --> 04:09:07.34 Launcher and take it out then both Iraq and Afghanistan combined it was just an insane amount of one of five
04:09:07.34 --> 04:09:11.26 Dropped and so every single day we had this old school
04:09:12.22 --> 04:09:18.46 World War two air raid siren on our base and every single day that thing would go off at a different time and
04:09:19.26 --> 04:09:22.70 Guys would run to the bunker. It just got to the point where it was like October and November
04:09:22.94 --> 04:09:24.94 Arbitan commanders was just like to hell with this
04:09:25.18 --> 04:09:33.42 We're mustering the entire battalion in your area of operations and we're walking online all the way to the border and to we find this thing and kill the people who own it
04:09:33.90 --> 04:09:37.10 legit that was that was our mission and who's leading that
04:09:37.10 --> 04:09:38.46 Operation was my
04:09:38.46 --> 04:09:45.18 My普通 was was responsible for pushing all the way to the border and it was like a four or five day mission
04:09:46.14 --> 04:09:48.70 I mean we I mean God it was cool to be a part of man to see
04:09:49.50 --> 04:09:53.90 Four four different companies and another company directly to that six companies total
04:09:54.30 --> 04:09:58.70 All in line walking you know at a na and the Marines are on the high ground
04:09:58.70 --> 04:10:02.62 We got my trucks in the low ground and then we'd rotate we'd be I mean it was just like something
04:10:02.62 --> 04:10:09.10 Out of world war two and we I mean look we were doing trench clearing I mean they the enemy had
04:10:09.10 --> 04:10:15.26 We were walking in areas that no American troops had ever been in and there were enemy trenches and we were doing trench clearing
04:10:15.26 --> 04:10:20.30 It was it was awesome. I mean what other infantry unit is doing trench clearing we were and
04:10:21.10 --> 04:10:26.30 I mean man we ran at those little assholes out man. Yeah, I was so lucky to in Ramadi
04:10:26.30 --> 04:10:30.30 We were doing brigade size operations and it was so
04:10:30.30 --> 04:10:36.78 Oh awesome. Yeah, I was gonna say to see you get to see that you guys do that kind of stuff not not a lot
04:10:37.10 --> 04:10:43.10 But like we even we didn't execute, but there was a big like division operation that was going on and I sat through this big briefing
04:10:43.10 --> 04:10:45.98 Yeah, they're cool man. I'm thinking myself this is so awesome
04:10:46.70 --> 04:10:50.78 And you know for us it was like World War II because we had tanks and the tanks are rolling through
04:10:50.78 --> 04:10:55.98 Smaks buildings and firing their main guns I can't imagine that it was really cool
04:10:55.98 --> 04:11:01.42 Be part of I mean be a little tiny tiny part of that was awesome to see you know for me
04:11:01.42 --> 04:11:07.82 Yeah, right to be a tiny part of that is awesome and to see the combined arms power
04:11:07.82 --> 04:11:12.14 Of the United States military brought to bear an enemy oh my god
04:11:12.14 --> 04:11:16.46 So brigade battalion level operations are no joke. I mean
04:11:17.26 --> 04:11:23.58 The Apache's and a tens we had a British tornado tornado whatever you go British tornado come do a show a force in a
04:11:23.58 --> 04:11:26.70 Wattie system and those British pilots are crazy freaks man
04:11:27.10 --> 04:11:31.42 Find down I mean it looked like you could reach up and touch this jet come screaming down over ahead and peel up away
04:11:31.42 --> 04:11:33.42 And I'm like this
04:11:33.42 --> 04:11:34.78 This is
04:11:34.78 --> 04:11:38.70 Something like I've never experienced one thing to be in a kill zone and put two inverses with an enemy
04:11:39.10 --> 04:11:40.62 But seeing a
04:11:40.62 --> 04:11:45.82 Battalion brigade division level operation and to be a part of it. It is I mean
04:11:46.46 --> 04:11:47.90 We'd go to bed at night
04:11:47.90 --> 04:11:51.18 It would be like something out of saving private Ryan would be sleeping on this ridge line
04:11:51.18 --> 04:11:55.58 The the horizon would be a wash would be like light up every now and again with one of five
04:11:55.58 --> 04:12:01.90 Boom boom you can feel that shutter in your bones you can feel it to cloud in your teeth and it's just you can feel the crump of it
04:12:01.90 --> 04:12:05.90 And then all of a sudden you know it's AC 130 Spectre Guns Quickly come on station
04:12:06.62 --> 04:12:12.22 Yes, and I'd be the guy on the front like coordinating targets with it with a J-Tac like hitting targets
04:12:12.22 --> 04:12:18.54 And we just fall asleep to that all night and then we'd get up and we do a sensitive side exploitation like at night or in the next day
04:12:18.54 --> 04:12:23.98 It was just like we just methodically took out everyone. It was the resistance as you guys pushed through this oh
04:12:24.22 --> 04:12:32.86 So we very first day we we go we went down a route called route trans Am and that was the that was the main route all the way to the border
04:12:32.86 --> 04:12:36.06 That we've had most of the issues for the enemy on and
04:12:37.02 --> 04:12:39.90 The Marines run the high ground with the A and A we run the low ground
04:12:40.22 --> 04:12:41.58 We
04:12:41.58 --> 04:12:43.58 entire Battalion mustard right behind us
04:12:44.14 --> 04:12:47.18 My opportunity pushes into the the mall of this
04:12:47.18 --> 04:12:55.34 Water system and route trans Am in three dudes in black man jams rpg ZK47 is run out from this side
04:12:55.82 --> 04:12:57.82 Road to start like waving their weapons and
04:12:58.38 --> 04:13:01.34 the A and A on the high ground just
04:13:02.14 --> 04:13:07.18 Start chasing them and I'm just like I get on the radio the Marines are like stop stop the A and a stop stop
04:13:07.90 --> 04:13:12.94 And two obvious they got baited into an ambush. They got surrounded and cut off all the
04:13:12.94 --> 04:13:17.82 All the Marines that are with them that were wounded the Marine commander on the ground with shot in the pelvis
04:13:17.82 --> 04:13:19.82 This is the guy was telling you about my opportunity
04:13:20.22 --> 04:13:23.42 Like our battalion commander and our company commander come running up to us
04:13:23.42 --> 04:13:27.50 So what's going on? I gave him the situation and they're trying to figure out a castback situation
04:13:27.50 --> 04:13:31.74 I'm like send a send we'll go get him right now send a send and so they sent us in and
04:13:32.78 --> 04:13:36.38 We drive into this kill zone. We start taking fire from all so I mean, it was just crazy
04:13:36.78 --> 04:13:38.78 Start taking fire from all sides
04:13:38.78 --> 04:13:42.94 I'm watching my truck the truck and front of me window shatter and all around it
04:13:42.94 --> 04:13:47.42 I'm looking up in the trees the water system is real tight right and these guys are just perks stuff on trees
04:13:47.82 --> 04:13:52.06 All these cliff-sized just taking pot shots at our gunners and we couldn't traverse our guns
04:13:52.06 --> 04:13:56.46 We couldn't traverse them high enough to actually mate so guys were coming up with the rifles and trying to shoot them and stuff
04:13:56.78 --> 04:13:59.74 It was crazy so watch the gunner and the and St. Jean
04:14:00.94 --> 04:14:03.74 John St. Jean from Haiti get shot in the head drop in the turret
04:14:03.90 --> 04:14:05.66 So get this when we eventually
04:14:05.66 --> 04:14:12.70 Evacuum the bullet punctured his helmet his helmet slowed the round enough that the round still punctured his skin
04:14:12.70 --> 04:14:18.86 But stopped on his skull skirt it around his skin on his like around the outside of his skull and back out the other side
04:14:19.42 --> 04:14:23.84 I mean this is like this is the kind of shit that you expect I mean it's like how is he alive?
04:14:23.84 --> 04:14:25.84 I happen to have guy it's crazy
04:14:25.84 --> 04:14:33.52 It's just crazy didn't come out the other side of the skin the the medic the corpsman just came over and like pushed the bullet
04:14:33.52 --> 04:14:38.56 Round back up to the entry point and squeeze the bullet out like a zip
04:14:38.56 --> 04:14:40.56 Oh God
04:14:40.56 --> 04:14:42.56 The bullets
04:14:42.56 --> 04:14:47.06 That's gross. Oh God, but so so we end up in this kill zone. We can't get to the Marines
04:14:47.06 --> 04:14:50.96 Where he's completely cut off and so we pull out we got like four or five casualties
04:14:50.96 --> 04:14:56.08 I had to evacuate we got them out we got them treated and this is when haul and this is when haul says
04:14:56.08 --> 04:15:00.44 I'm going up to get him sir give me it give me five guys from second-but-tune
04:15:00.44 --> 04:15:08.42 I'll take my squad up and get him and he fought up there. He fought up the hill fought to fought through two flanks of the enemy all the way
04:15:08.42 --> 04:15:13.86 I know just like I have a picture of him ascending the hill like looking back down the hill like doing this number
04:15:13.86 --> 04:15:18.30 I don't know why we got that picture, but it's it's it's always just a badass and
04:15:19.08 --> 04:15:21.48 fought through two flanks of the enemy gets to this Marine
04:15:21.92 --> 04:15:23.60 treats his wounds
04:15:23.60 --> 04:15:25.60 leads in a jungle penetrator
04:15:25.60 --> 04:15:32.58 Blackhawk helicopter comes in two Apache's for an escort they get at jungle penetrator in both the patches take shots
04:15:32.58 --> 04:15:38.46 They have to pull off station the blackhawk gets shot up. They get the guy the Marine on the jungle penetrator flying back
04:15:38.46 --> 04:15:44.04 But I mean our our birds got shot up. I mean so we ended up killing a bunch of the back guys
04:15:44.04 --> 04:15:45.56 This is when
04:15:45.56 --> 04:15:47.56 When St. Jean got shot in the head
04:15:47.56 --> 04:15:54.52 He fired and the guy that shot him fire they hit each other right and St. Jean hit the guy in the stomach and this guy tumbles down right next to our truck
04:15:54.52 --> 04:15:57.12 And that's when I see him like looking in this guy's eyes
04:15:57.72 --> 04:16:04.24 He's got this gaping stomach one. He's like bleeding to death right there in the dirt. There's no question. He's gonna die and he's just looking at me
04:16:04.24 --> 04:16:09.64 And I'm just like looking at him and nurses know remorse in this guy's eyes if it were reversed
04:16:09.64 --> 04:16:12.000 He's just the most evil. There's no
04:16:12.88 --> 04:16:15.88 No redeeming no redemption in those eyes, you know and
04:16:16.80 --> 04:16:21.88 Over the radio stalkers on the radio the guy that saved me on June 10th to pull me up that guy's on the radio
04:16:21.88 --> 04:16:26.04 He's got a shotgun leaning out his money. He's like let me take him out. Let me take him out. I'm sitting and I'm like no
04:16:26.24 --> 04:16:28.12 No, it will come on sir. Why?
04:16:28.12 --> 04:16:30.88 Let me take him out and my gunner's like sir because he's got a shotgun
04:16:30.88 --> 04:16:33.36 He's like you're sorry. He's right there. Let me kill him. Let me kill him. I'm like no
04:16:33.88 --> 04:16:38.24 We're not doing that we're not doing that and I just not I just remember thinking this was this
04:16:38.24 --> 04:16:39.24 There's like
04:16:39.24 --> 04:16:41.80 This was like a split second thing to like not happen
04:16:41.80 --> 04:16:45.24 And I had to reinforce the several times. They're like I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm like no you're not
04:16:46.24 --> 04:16:48.24 I just felt
04:16:48.24 --> 04:16:53.000 In the clearest say it was like divine clarity or whatever. I just did not want this shit head
04:16:53.72 --> 04:17:00.20 I don't want this guy's soul this terrible evil disgusting human being soul on the hearts of these men
04:17:00.48 --> 04:17:02.48 You know my men are
04:17:03.04 --> 04:17:06.40 worse so much more you know and so
04:17:07.64 --> 04:17:11.16 We go out we evacuate our casualties and we go back in right we you know
04:17:11.16 --> 04:17:15.28 E-vacricazies go back in try to get the Marine we couldn't do it but the guy was gone. He'd be an E-vac
04:17:15.28 --> 04:17:17.28 There's just a puddle of blood there, but still like
04:17:17.28 --> 04:17:19.28 These guys E-vac this guy
04:17:20.84 --> 04:17:27.52 What was like a sheer cliff face you know what I mean? So that was on that was first five minutes of the batai in operation
04:17:27.52 --> 04:17:33.80 Just to give you sense of the enemy we face you know and we got an entire batai in of infantry brought to bear that was the first five minutes
04:17:34.000 --> 04:17:37.64 So we took those guys out and that's when we did the trench clearing on the next ridge lines
04:17:37.64 --> 04:17:43.80 So these guys were shooting us from these trenches and I got all this crazy pictures of this trench complex and we're like like
04:17:43.80 --> 04:17:48.84 You know just like room clearing with number one man just kind of marching down the trench and stuff. It's a crazy shit ever
04:17:48.84 --> 04:17:50.84 I mean we
04:17:50.84 --> 04:17:55.02 We did trench clearing once at JRTC is not like it's something we trained for you know
04:17:55.02 --> 04:18:00.90 I mean, but it was just crazy that there we were no shit doing trench clearing you know and people people will criticize
04:18:00.90 --> 04:18:03.72 I mean we're enemy really in the trenches. I'm like yeah
04:18:03.72 --> 04:18:07.96 We really were in the trenches fighting these guys and then we'd take over their trenches and light them for two
04:18:07.96 --> 04:18:10.60 We'd stay there we'd hold the line there. It was just crazy and
04:18:10.60 --> 04:18:12.60 And
04:18:12.60 --> 04:18:16.12 We ended up fighting all the way to the border and we found a bunch of their camps and this was our thing like
04:18:16.84 --> 04:18:20.76 Halfway through the deployment. We just started burn their camps to the ground shooting their livestock
04:18:21.16 --> 04:18:25.000 You know killing their livestock burn their camps taking their guns ammunition
04:18:25.000 --> 04:18:30.000 Whatever whatever until we could exploit from their camps and just burn the rest of the ground and man that pissed them off
04:18:30.000 --> 04:18:37.68 And we found their final camp right in the border and that have gotten like in one final attack with them and that up killing them
04:18:37.68 --> 04:18:43.98 But along the way we found the 122 launcher killed the guys that were operating it captured it
04:18:43.98 --> 04:18:49.94 Yeah, we captured the launcher first ever captured and I've gannest in and then we found this one of seven launcher that had been using
04:18:49.94 --> 04:18:52.84 That they had like a dummy cord of wires and we got in this crazy
04:18:53.16 --> 04:18:55.44 We got in this crazy like okay
04:18:55.44 --> 04:19:00.16 Carral shoot out with the guys we're like I'm on a dismounted patrol and I got a fire team with me in my pertune behind me
04:19:00.16 --> 04:19:06.72 And I'm on point with them and I just like give the freeze right and everyone takes a knee and I pick up this like a little piece of yellow wire
04:19:06.72 --> 04:19:10.24 That's this long and I'm like I mean honestly, I didn't think anything of it
04:19:10.24 --> 04:19:14.14 I should have but I'm like this distance and that's the distance and feel right and all the sudden we look up and
04:19:14.50 --> 04:19:19.82 Contan win my guy from South Vietnam is like he's like Dr. Jones Dr. Jones like that guy
04:19:19.94 --> 04:19:24.32 He's like so we got him back on like all the sudden it was like they're 10 feet away from it
04:19:24.32 --> 04:19:27.42 It's just like like okay core out shoot out right there and
04:19:28.38 --> 04:19:33.04 Contan like ended up pegging the guy chasing bonds. I charge him and everything else and we're like running after these guys
04:19:33.04 --> 04:19:36.24 It was a crazy this was my life dude, and this is not the kind of I
04:19:37.04 --> 04:19:41.32 Mean I cannot believe that I went through some of this shit man
04:19:41.32 --> 04:19:48.32 I mean just not the kind of you know, yeah, and so this was we pushed them out then we went to Christmas and then and then
04:19:48.32 --> 04:19:51.32 And then we got
04:19:51.32 --> 04:19:56.24 Like we we got attacked one more time by like a big big big big big big big big force
04:19:57.40 --> 04:19:59.40 Yeah, you guys you guys
04:19:59.40 --> 04:20:03.88 I Mean when you guys close the doubt I mean you get to the point where you close out
04:20:03.88 --> 04:20:07.36 You're like they're last stand on the final day. We see the high ground overlooking the frontier
04:20:07.36 --> 04:20:13.20 We remain the remaining enemy soldiers chose to make their last stand here between us and Pakistan on reborder checkpoint
04:20:13.32 --> 04:20:18.48 They marshaled their remaining weapons and in place their machine guns with their usual tactical cunning
04:20:18.48 --> 04:20:22.40 We'd been under fire for almost a week filthy reaking of gun powder and body odor
04:20:22.40 --> 04:20:27.20 Constipated by MREs we'd spent Operation catamount blood sleeping in our rigs between scourmishes
04:20:27.20 --> 04:20:33.32 Now came the climactic moment moment. We spent all year making last stands against their furious assaults here
04:20:33.32 --> 04:20:37.72 The roles were reversed and they would die in place. Yes. Yes. It was awesome
04:20:38.28 --> 04:20:44.64 It was awesome our forward air controllers called in a final series of air strikes the eight ten pilots
04:20:44.96 --> 04:20:50.80 The eight ten pilots unleashed to do what we're unleashed to do what they do best with J. Dan's and 30 millimeter
04:20:50.80 --> 04:20:56.76 Strafing runs the ward hogs pulverized the enemy when it was over there was no need to assault that'll last stand
04:20:57.16 --> 04:20:59.64 Not an insurgent remained upright
04:21:00.56 --> 04:21:06.76 Captain die in Lieutenant Colonel toner walked to our ridge. They've been working the radios with the forward air controllers
04:21:07.40 --> 04:21:12.84 And now gaze down into the smoke shrouded valley the last eight ten swept past its chain gun
04:21:12.96 --> 04:21:20.12 Showed throwing lead in one final act of overkill as it pulled up and race skyward die in toner erupted in cheers
04:21:20.12 --> 04:21:25.92 Soon all along our line the men joined in it was crazy. It was like here's all pain
04:21:25.92 --> 04:21:31.52 I'm saying I've telling you man. I would victory cures all pain. It's the truth
04:21:31.52 --> 04:21:35.80 I mean we had we had been on the receiving end of this shit for almost a year
04:21:36.04 --> 04:21:41.24 We finally drove those little bastards back to Pakistan and we cheer was like something out of a movie man
04:21:41.24 --> 04:21:46.08 It was like everyone's like holding the rifle up in the air and cheering and we thought that was the last attack
04:21:46.08 --> 04:21:48.08 But it wasn't we thought that was their last stand
04:21:48.08 --> 04:21:53.68 But then they threw I'm telling you that through everything but the kitchen sink at us in January right right two days before
04:21:53.68 --> 04:22:01.88 Like a piece of wood you got the heads up from Intel. Yeah, yeah, so you're you're out in an OP right and and you're we built
04:22:01.88 --> 04:22:07.62 This was the very first combat out of this little compound out post. Yeah, yeah, so we built it and we were there with these engineers
04:22:07.62 --> 04:22:11.88 Right and we're like like it was built in the literally the worst place you could possibly imagine I'm like sir
04:22:11.88 --> 04:22:15.08 This is stupid like this is not a good place to put a base now
04:22:15.08 --> 04:22:21.28 We got to put it here brigades, so we got to put it there. So we'll put it there. So we bring these engineers in to do this and we get a like we get a
04:22:21.28 --> 04:22:24.24 TAC there's like some stupid rock and attack or something and we all go to bed
04:22:24.24 --> 04:22:27.84 We all go to bed and like keep in mind we're like this is like one of the most dangerous places
04:22:27.84 --> 04:22:33.72 And I've got like four gun trucks up there with me. So I got 16 guys or six something like 16 guys in the ground
04:22:33.72 --> 04:22:39.96 And I got a bunch of engineers fill in these hasco walls. We wake up right at the night after the the first attack
04:22:39.96 --> 04:22:43.16 And it was like a nothing burger attack and we wake up and all the engineers are gone
04:22:43.16 --> 04:22:48.10 They had did he mount in the middle of the night left his there. They left his there with half filled hasco walls
04:22:48.10 --> 04:22:54.26 The base wasn't even complete. So now we're really stranded. There's nowhere we can go. We're just 16 of you. Yeah, so we had the car gun trucks
04:22:54.26 --> 04:22:58.04 Yes, so I have any afghan with you any anything no no
04:22:58.04 --> 04:23:01.48 No, they didn't want to go out there and patrol this is up in Margaard Margaard was right on the border
04:23:01.48 --> 04:23:05.20 And so we had to call for reinforcements somewhere to get a couple more trucks up there
04:23:05.20 --> 04:23:12.000 I got like now I've got like 26 27 guys up there and it's like we're going home in two weeks right everyone is like
04:23:13.24 --> 04:23:17.68 Checked out at this point like they just want to go home safely and I get this call
04:23:18.32 --> 04:23:22.68 Like no bullshit this call I'm in my truck at like three in the morning
04:23:22.84 --> 04:23:30.76 Get a call from my S2 my intelligence guys up at Patience and hey black up 36 this is catamount two
04:23:31.20 --> 04:23:33.20 you know just I
04:23:33.20 --> 04:23:41.18 Don't want to alarm you, but there are 350 guys coming to attack your position right now and I I just was like
04:23:41.68 --> 04:23:47.18 I like I like take the hand mic and I just like you're see the Hitler memes where he takes his glasses
04:23:47.18 --> 04:23:52.32 Oh, you know it's like that moment for me. I just like okay, just okay, Roger
04:23:52.32 --> 04:23:58.12 And I put the hand mic slow and I like slept walk over to Greece and I said hey, yeah, did you hear that and he's like
04:23:59.12 --> 04:24:01.12 I heard it and I so
04:24:01.12 --> 04:24:03.84 What do we what do we do what do we do about days like
04:24:04.92 --> 04:24:08.56 He did he literally just gonna I don't know so I go back over to my truck
04:24:08.56 --> 04:24:12.92 I call I said I said what's going on? He said he's like look we're gonna stack up air for you
04:24:12.92 --> 04:24:15.82 We're gonna make sure that you have air all we need you to do is observe
04:24:15.82 --> 04:24:19.68 We've got a predator in the air. We've got predator out. But you got a force coming from
04:24:20.44 --> 04:24:23.68 Directly from the east marching down this route just north of route
04:24:23.68 --> 04:24:29.36 Transan where we had thought we'd wiped out the enemy of force of 250 coming from that direction and another 50
04:24:29.36 --> 04:24:33.78 Force of 50 coming in from the northwest so an massive sort of pincer movement
04:24:34.18 --> 04:24:39.40 And to our been to our Patoon that marked him on like FBCB2 like you guys have those two like the
04:24:39.40 --> 04:24:45.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's been watching these like little red marks come to our you know come to our position. How often did you see that?
04:24:45.92 --> 04:24:51.62 See that see them actually marking their like I never never have to have to like we'd never even really
04:24:52.28 --> 04:24:54.44 I mean look the whole entire batined was in here
04:24:54.44 --> 04:25:00.48 So they had they had predator that two predators out there on the objective under a nods they were sprinkling where they the bad guys were and
04:25:01.16 --> 04:25:08.36 And look later I still have I still have the the predator feed from that you can count all 250
04:25:08.36 --> 04:25:15.24 I'm so they stacked up all this air and we waited for him to get a kilometer away from where we were and the last thing they said before
04:25:15.24 --> 04:25:16.24 We dropped
04:25:16.24 --> 04:25:19.24 probably 150 rounds of 105's on him
04:25:19.24 --> 04:25:25.34 Siamal Tanius three or four two thousand pound bombs on him. They said like when you you know when you get to say said something like
04:25:25.34 --> 04:25:31.50 Here's what you wrote no ball when you overrun the Americans caught their eggs off and melt them on stage
04:25:31.50 --> 04:25:37.58 Yeah, good luck and I'll see you on the objective. I'll see you on the objective. Did you guys get that until report while you're out there?
04:25:37.58 --> 04:25:40.44 Yes, oh my god, and then and then so we dropped
04:25:40.72 --> 04:25:44.80 Okay, so we we kicked off the engagement we had a B1 on station
04:25:44.80 --> 04:25:51.10 Kipped off the engagement I have I have the I had the predator of all this I have the predator of the entire of the Jdms
04:25:51.10 --> 04:25:55.40 Fallen everything and the bad guys scary and it's the craziest shit you'd ever see and like
04:25:56.000 --> 04:25:57.48 Three or four right in a row
04:25:57.48 --> 04:26:02.28 They were all marching in a tactical column so one bomb boom boom boom all the way down the column
04:26:02.28 --> 04:26:04.68 Right and you see these it's like it's on white hot so that
04:26:05.32 --> 04:26:09.04 Split split just blazing in on the predator you see these guys run around and then
04:26:09.32 --> 04:26:14.02 Spectre comes in and starts lighting these guys up and Apache takes on this force from the I mean it was the crazy
04:26:14.02 --> 04:26:17.74 I'm telling you and an eight ten coming in and then the predator gets in with the how fires
04:26:17.74 --> 04:26:23.82 I got the whole thing on predator and it's just that we went on the objective that the very next day and this went on all night
04:26:23.82 --> 04:26:30.58 We just lit these mother up all night long and and we get on the objective and it was
04:26:31.50 --> 04:26:36.78 It was the most gnarly thing I'd ever seen just do us at an SSE like a sensitive side exploitation
04:26:37.02 --> 04:26:39.18 But get on the objective and there are
04:26:39.18 --> 04:26:47.46 Literal body parts hanging up in the trees there are human body parts that stretch from where they were about to
04:26:47.78 --> 04:26:50.58 Prepo and attack on us stretch back two kilometers
04:26:51.42 --> 04:26:53.54 Two kilometers of just utter
04:26:53.54 --> 04:26:55.54 Gore and devastation and
04:26:56.26 --> 04:27:02.98 There were one survivor when we get back there in the A&As like like hitting this guy with the buttstock of an AK 47 the guys barely clinging to life
04:27:02.98 --> 04:27:09.90 Really wasn't worth much to it's anyway, but what we found was these guys had better Merrill combat boots than we did
04:27:09.90 --> 04:27:15.88 They were all wearing body armor. They had helmets on their rifles were fresh still with the packing grease
04:27:16.26 --> 04:27:18.50 Iranian serial numbers right and
04:27:19.26 --> 04:27:26.86 I mean, their equipment was better just just as good if not better than ours. I'm surprised it they did an evonite vision and some of them had pack mill
04:27:27.78 --> 04:27:29.78 Military frontier core ID cards
04:27:29.78 --> 04:27:35.16 Damn and we sent all this intel up higher and I swear to God two days later
04:27:35.16 --> 04:27:41.44 We get a call back to the to the 80 second airborne comes in to relieve us my guy start getting sent home one at a time
04:27:41.44 --> 04:27:47.72 And no bullshit like my guys are in various phases of redeployment like I'm the last one with the grease in on the base right now
04:27:47.72 --> 04:27:52.22 Like thinking Jesus Christ I'm surrounded by all these guys because you deployments over it. It's over it
04:27:52.22 --> 04:27:57.90 It's like started to you started to send guys on once and people a lot of times people think so the military
04:27:57.90 --> 04:28:01.38 You know just everyone will come in and leave at the same time know, but it's sort of a trickle thing
04:28:01.38 --> 04:28:06.38 You got to get squeeze people in where you can get rid of correct people are just trying to head home at this point correct
04:28:06.38 --> 04:28:10.44 And so I got guys home that've already made it home. They've already reunited with their families
04:28:10.44 --> 04:28:15.24 I got guys and bogram ready to fly home. I got guys in the air. I mean, they're spread out all over
04:28:15.58 --> 04:28:20.46 It's just me and grease and left on the base with a bunch of 80 second airborne guys and you're gonna do some turnover on ops with them
04:28:20.46 --> 04:28:23.20 Yep, we did what's called like a in the army like a rip-toa
04:28:23.74 --> 04:28:26.06 Relief in place. So now it's just you and grease and
04:28:26.06 --> 04:28:31.12 Laging or it's as gone in various stages of getting home or they're actually home
04:28:32.12 --> 04:28:34.62 And then this happens five days later
04:28:34.62 --> 04:28:39.10 0300 grease and I were roused from restless sleep until to report to the operation center
04:28:39.50 --> 04:28:45.58 We rest over to find Lieutenant Colonel Toner waiting for us on our computerized conference system
04:28:45.90 --> 04:28:52.66 When Captain died joined us lieutenant Colonel said men I'm gonna read to you a quote from the former Marine Corps common-dont
04:28:52.66 --> 04:28:59.72 General Charles C. Kruellac and here's the quote when the hard times come and they will
04:29:00.34 --> 04:29:02.10 People cling to leaders
04:29:02.10 --> 04:29:09.30 They know and trust to those who are not detached but involved and to those who have consciences
04:29:09.94 --> 04:29:17.38 They will seek out leaders who stand for something bigger than themselves and who have the moral courage and strength of character to do
04:29:17.70 --> 04:29:20.50 What they know in their hearts to be the right thing
04:29:20.50 --> 04:29:23.86 And you're thinking what the hell is this
04:29:25.86 --> 04:29:27.86 men
04:29:27.86 --> 04:29:29.86 We have been extended for 120 days
04:29:31.34 --> 04:29:35.46 He let that sink in thoughts of home vanished as I did the math June
04:29:35.46 --> 04:29:39.38 We would be here until June. We would have to survive another spring offensive
04:29:39.54 --> 04:29:45.06 What are the odds of that the room spun the men around me looked asian
04:29:45.06 --> 04:29:51.06 After Lieutenant Colonel Toner signed off, Greece and let out one of his classic sling blade laughs
04:29:51.14 --> 04:29:53.14 Has if he didn't have a care in the world
04:29:53.14 --> 04:29:54.74 I need a cigarette
04:29:54.74 --> 04:29:56.74 He growled as he stepped out into the night
04:29:57.54 --> 04:30:01.38 I followed furious in his real action. What that was wrong with you I yelled
04:30:01.62 --> 04:30:07.94 How can you not be pissed off at this? Greece and just shook his head sir every deployment I've ever been on has been extended
04:30:07.94 --> 04:30:11.78 It don't mean nothing it just means we get to play on me for four more months
04:30:11.78 --> 04:30:16.50 Over the next 48 hours my platoon reassembled at Fobber Mill
04:30:17.54 --> 04:30:21.38 Most of the men had learned the bad news at Bogram as they were waiting for their flight home
04:30:21.62 --> 04:30:25.06 They were re-assured their body armor helmets and gear and thrown back into a chinook
04:30:25.94 --> 04:30:29.62 Others had already made it back to the United States military police knocked on their doors
04:30:29.62 --> 04:30:31.62 Or met them at the airport and told them the news
04:30:31.62 --> 04:30:34.90 They would told the pack and escort it onto the first available flights out
04:30:35.30 --> 04:30:38.58 They came back sonland fearful and devoid of hope
04:30:38.58 --> 04:30:43.38 Everyone knew the odds we had all had close encounters with death
04:30:44.98 --> 04:30:47.62 A few inches of one way a failure to duck
04:30:48.10 --> 04:30:51.14 Attorned the left instead of the right and death would have had us
04:30:51.62 --> 04:30:56.90 We cheated it so many times that it seemed inconceivable that luck would have our backs now
04:30:58.50 --> 04:31:02.58 When we all gathered back at Burmel Captain Diadrestas men he announced
04:31:02.58 --> 04:31:09.38 Bros. Lee we will begin continuous combat operations tonight we're back on it
04:31:10.58 --> 04:31:12.58 suck it up
04:31:13.70 --> 04:31:19.70 We became a platoon of condemned as darkness fell our bullet scarred home visa waited us in ones and two
04:31:19.70 --> 04:31:25.14 Is the platoons gathered around them drivers slip behind the wheels gunners climbed into the turrets and loaded their weapons
04:31:25.14 --> 04:31:29.78 My dismounts sacked stacked extra comp ammunition into their rigs
04:31:29.78 --> 04:31:33.22 Greece and smoked and stalked around with his neer beer unflappable as ever
04:31:33.62 --> 04:31:36.18 Saboblu refuse and yelled at one of his men
04:31:36.82 --> 04:31:41.54 I watched the familiar scene and felt nothing but a biting love for these incredible human beings
04:31:42.50 --> 04:31:45.30 Did America know the metal of her warrior sons?
04:31:47.06 --> 04:31:49.06 Not a man refused his duty
04:31:50.02 --> 04:31:54.50 Despite everything we had not lost the one thing that mattered most
04:31:55.22 --> 04:31:57.22 Faith in one another
04:31:57.22 --> 04:32:03.78 Chris Brown stood in my turret shoulder sagging as I opened my door I asked him how you do in brother
04:32:05.06 --> 04:32:08.10 He looked down at me with young man's eyes a thousand years old
04:32:09.06 --> 04:32:11.06 We got this sir
04:32:11.30 --> 04:32:13.30 No worries
04:32:16.74 --> 04:32:23.78 We got this sir no worries and I actually wanted to call that out specifically because to me that little statement from him
04:32:23.78 --> 04:32:25.78 I
04:32:25.78 --> 04:32:27.78 Reflex
04:32:28.42 --> 04:32:29.78 the main
04:32:29.78 --> 04:32:31.78 broad
04:32:31.78 --> 04:32:33.78 over arching
04:32:34.18 --> 04:32:43.38 Spirit of the soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines that I worked with their collective response to whatever the world throws at him
04:32:46.02 --> 04:32:48.82 Is that right there we got this no worries
04:32:48.82 --> 04:32:50.82 and
04:32:51.94 --> 04:32:57.94 Then you know you you asked the question right there does America know the metal of her warriors and that's
04:33:00.50 --> 04:33:03.78 That's another thing and that's why I'm glad that you wrote this book
04:33:04.90 --> 04:33:11.22 And I'm glad when people come out and explain what it's like for real on the front lines
04:33:11.22 --> 04:33:20.18 Because you know we just talked about that that psychological thing of getting home or
04:33:20.82 --> 04:33:26.82 Getting to get to sleep and be warm and comfortable and then having to go back and you guys got that to the end degree
04:33:27.38 --> 04:33:29.38 I think it was by far
04:33:29.38 --> 04:33:32.90 the most difficult part of our entire deployment because if you think about
04:33:33.70 --> 04:33:35.70 the history of any military
04:33:35.70 --> 04:33:42.82 You know in the days of Sparta like and you were called to arms like you were directly responsible for how good
04:33:43.14 --> 04:33:48.26 You were with your weapon system you had your own weapons as you trained on it you lived or died by it, you know
04:33:49.46 --> 04:33:51.46 and
04:33:51.46 --> 04:33:55.94 In many ways you were accountable almost directly responsible and accountable for how you performed in the battlefield right
04:33:56.58 --> 04:34:01.70 But in the modern day armies like these things are issued to you, you know and
04:34:01.70 --> 04:34:07.46 Your issued your weapon your issued three meals a day you're given shelter the army itself in an
04:34:07.46 --> 04:34:13.54 Abstract way almost fulfills and almost paternal like role to a lot of these soldiers so
04:34:14.74 --> 04:34:16.74 When when we were extended
04:34:17.38 --> 04:34:21.14 You know guy like Greason who's been there done that he knows it's a possibility right?
04:34:21.54 --> 04:34:27.62 But young guys like me who made it most of the butoon like we didn't and it felt like a betrayal
04:34:27.62 --> 04:34:33.38 You know almost by like a parent and that violation of trust you know how we felt about it at the time
04:34:33.38 --> 04:34:38.74 Anyway, it was almost insurmountable to kind of you know there's something that happens when you get back to
04:34:38.74 --> 04:34:43.30 Borgram and you turn in your armor piercing sappy plates and all your your ammo and yet, you know
04:34:44.10 --> 04:34:48.26 You know you're going on you just say you say you're sub okay, I made it
04:34:48.26 --> 04:34:52.50 This like a logic that made it you brain dumb stubby let your hair down a little bit you kick back you smile
04:34:52.50 --> 04:34:59.70 You everything just feels a little bit better life the world just feels a little bit more colorful like you're not looking through
04:35:00.34 --> 04:35:04.02 You know dirt and crusted window all the time right that everything it's like
04:35:04.58 --> 04:35:09.38 Everything's amazing food tastes better water tastes better your workouts are better like everything is better
04:35:09.38 --> 04:35:11.86 You know and to find out that like
04:35:12.82 --> 04:35:18.10 All of that has been pulled out from underneath you and you somehow you have to go back into the fray
04:35:19.46 --> 04:35:20.66 And
04:35:20.66 --> 04:35:22.66 Survive another spring offensive or
04:35:23.86 --> 04:35:29.70 I get you more volley fires of RPGs more listen to those assholes on i-com
04:35:29.70 --> 04:35:34.18 I mean seriously more rockets more air raid Simon going off in the middle of the night. It was just
04:35:34.50 --> 04:35:41.06 It was the greatest leadership challenge that I've ever had to endure to see those guys get off the Chinook
04:35:41.70 --> 04:35:45.86 With again young man's eyes a thousand years old these this is this is
04:35:46.66 --> 04:35:50.10 This is the play to if I think the warrior in in general in that
04:35:50.10 --> 04:35:55.62 We come back to the states and like we might you know an age wise be 20 something
04:35:55.62 --> 04:36:02.10 But we've we've lived the lives of someone who's a thousand years old and lost just as many people have seen your citizens on our own country, you know
04:36:03.22 --> 04:36:11.70 And so this is this is what I had in my platoon a group of men a group of boys who would really had the life experience life time of experience is
04:36:12.58 --> 04:36:14.58 a man you know a man grown man and
04:36:15.06 --> 04:36:17.06 and
04:36:17.06 --> 04:36:19.06 At the end of the day it was
04:36:19.86 --> 04:36:26.02 You know the love and brotherhood that we share for one another, you know you always hear like with the the the might of the American military
04:36:26.02 --> 04:36:29.38 And things that we can bring to bear and we got the best equipment and we have the
04:36:29.86 --> 04:36:35.14 You know the best rivals and the best technology and you're on the cutting edge of everything and all that's great
04:36:35.46 --> 04:36:39.38 But really what makes the American military the best in the history of the world
04:36:39.94 --> 04:36:45.46 You know our secret weapon our real secret weapon is the grit the love the brotherhood that we share for one another
04:36:45.46 --> 04:36:51.22 And it's that attitude it's that attitude and that love that we share for one another
04:36:51.22 --> 04:36:53.78 That allows us to accomplish anything on the battlefield
04:36:54.02 --> 04:36:57.86 You know we rely we don't want to fail the man and woman to the left of the right of us, you know
04:36:58.42 --> 04:37:01.78 And that love drives us to do extraordinary things and that's what I saw
04:37:01.78 --> 04:37:05.70 I mean look this of the outlaw baton these weren't navy seals these were kids, you know
04:37:06.50 --> 04:37:11.38 A lot of my machine gunners who performed the most heroic acts you can possibly imagine I've never seen
04:37:11.38 --> 04:37:16.26 Never seen 18-year-old kids do the things that I saw that my men do in that puttoon
04:37:16.66 --> 04:37:21.70 The jobs that they had before toting a machine gun in the mountains of Afghanistan was high school shortstop
04:37:21.94 --> 04:37:25.30 Yet somehow these guys came out and they brought it every single day
04:37:25.30 --> 04:37:28.18 You know ordinary men doing extraordinary things
04:37:28.82 --> 04:37:33.42 You know the greatest triumphs of the human spirit were the things that I saw in combat every day so you know
04:37:34.02 --> 04:37:36.02 Combat can be
04:37:36.02 --> 04:37:42.34 I mean obviously it's hell on earth. It's destructive. It's terrible people get hurt wounded killed
04:37:42.74 --> 04:37:46.98 But I also saw some of the greatest most beautiful triumphs of the human spirit as well all in a
04:37:47.38 --> 04:37:49.38 Motley group of infantry guys that
04:37:50.34 --> 04:37:54.34 Different races socioeconomic statuses different countries whatever different religions
04:37:54.90 --> 04:37:57.94 Come together and accomplish amazing things and
04:37:58.66 --> 04:38:00.18 And
04:38:00.18 --> 04:38:04.10 You know really if it weren't for them. I mean I'm telling you right now in a very literal sense of it weren't for them
04:38:04.10 --> 04:38:08.90 I wouldn't be here. I mean I had one of my soldiers saved my life on the battlefield when I hurt when I got wounded but
04:38:10.82 --> 04:38:15.86 I mean I owe them everything and that's what that book is about that book is a testament to their to their legacy
04:38:15.86 --> 04:38:17.86 I mean I remember getting back
04:38:18.26 --> 04:38:22.42 You know I go to my arm our league and I believe and actually my soldiers would go in their leave and
04:38:22.66 --> 04:38:25.70 Americans would be like so where are we deployed? Oh, thank you for your service right?
04:38:25.70 --> 04:38:28.26 We're great. I'm grateful that we live in a country that's like that
04:38:28.26 --> 04:38:34.50 They'd be like oh oh you're in a f*** oh good you're in Afghanistan. Oh just thank God you're not Iraq orackers just so bad
04:38:34.50 --> 04:38:36.82 You know and my guys would be like Jesus
04:38:36.82 --> 04:38:41.54 I just got shot in the head last week and they'd come home and be like sir Americans have no idea what that
04:38:41.54 --> 04:38:44.02 We're doing over here so I just felt like
04:38:45.14 --> 04:38:51.70 At some some it's my job as the leader to step up and try to capture their legacy and write a book and make sure that
04:38:52.10 --> 04:38:54.10 Their heroism on the battlefield does not
04:38:54.10 --> 04:38:59.30 It's not lost through the ages like I want I want their exploits to be written
04:38:59.86 --> 04:39:07.46 So that we can pass down the heroic exploits down the future generations and that that's what that book is it's their story. It's not mine
04:39:08.98 --> 04:39:10.98 And so you guys wrapped up the
04:39:11.22 --> 04:39:16.82 Next four months. How was the last four months? How was terrible? I mean we still got a tack you know
04:39:16.82 --> 04:39:21.94 I mean and the thing is the people that we attacked were not nearly as good and they weren't nearly as well trained
04:39:21.94 --> 04:39:29.86 But you know a stray bullet is a stray bullet doesn't matter. You know catch a ricochet off a ballistic shield hit you in the head underneath your helmet your dead, you know
04:39:30.42 --> 04:39:32.42 so
04:39:32.42 --> 04:39:34.90 It was still pretty rough. I didn't write about it in that book
04:39:35.30 --> 04:39:37.78 But it was still pretty rough and somehow
04:39:38.50 --> 04:39:40.50 You know I had some great it also
04:39:41.30 --> 04:39:46.66 The combat was crazy but also had some crazy leadership experiences as well because of the surge
04:39:46.66 --> 04:39:52.98 Uh all the units that were sent to were supposed to replace us went to Iraq instead
04:39:52.98 --> 04:39:55.78 That's why we were extended there was literally nobody to replace us
04:39:55.78 --> 04:39:58.02 Well they ended up tag in the 173rd airborne
04:39:58.26 --> 04:40:04.74 They guys that we had really even going in to come back and they were tasked with going to Iraq and so they were in Germany at CMTC
04:40:05.70 --> 04:40:09.22 Training just a month prior to the deployment just to get ready for an adventure
04:40:09.22 --> 04:40:12.42 eventual deployment to Afghanistan and they they had been training for that
04:40:12.42 --> 04:40:20.74 Area of an operation so they plucked one lieutenant and one senior non-commission officer from the battalion to go and train these guys
04:40:20.74 --> 04:40:27.46 In Germany on a moment notice and it was me so three weeks so for three weeks just prior to the second spring offensive
04:40:27.46 --> 04:40:29.46 I found myself boots on the ground in Germany
04:40:30.34 --> 04:40:35.62 Training one 73rd airborne guys embedded with a company in Germany. I mean it was just this never happened before
04:40:36.18 --> 04:40:37.94 Not this has never happened before
04:40:37.94 --> 04:40:39.46 You know
04:40:39.46 --> 04:40:44.82 I mean an army I mean we our deployment was 485 days man. I mean like easy company
04:40:44.82 --> 04:40:48.98 The 101st airborne jumped into Normandy and hot and fought to Hitler's Eagles nice and less time
04:40:49.62 --> 04:40:50.62 145 days
04:40:50.62 --> 04:40:57.38 We're just out there flappin in the wind that whole time man and and and you know and then I get so it we get extended the last day
04:40:58.82 --> 04:41:02.42 Go to Germany like I mean just put that in a movie you wouldn't believe you'd be like oh yeah
04:41:02.42 --> 04:41:06.26 Yeah, right exactly the guys are back in America and now they're getting told now
04:41:06.26 --> 04:41:10.74 That is what I think about now. I look back on this experience and I'm like oh my god
04:41:10.74 --> 04:41:16.34 This truth is stranger than fiction man. Yeah, and then you guys get you guys eventually do get home and
04:41:18.26 --> 04:41:22.18 They start their work up, but you're you're like non-deployable now because you're yeah
04:41:22.18 --> 04:41:26.18 Because of all those wounds that you talked about you're brain you're you're fractures to your skull
04:41:26.18 --> 04:41:31.30 You're brain you're lecking leak and fluid out of your ears. I had cerebral spinal fluid dry
04:41:31.30 --> 04:41:35.62 He it healed I was able to function and and combat and by the way I'll tell you I
04:41:35.62 --> 04:41:40.34 Since that book is come out I've been criticized a lot about hey man like you're a leader
04:41:40.34 --> 04:41:44.66 You get to take care of yourself. You can't take care of your own injuries how you expect to take care of your troops
04:41:45.06 --> 04:41:49.30 And that's a good it's a good criticism. It's a valid criticism. I I just respond
04:41:49.54 --> 04:41:53.38 You know and I think it's kind of one of a dress that here going off script a little bit like
04:41:53.86 --> 04:41:58.26 I'd guys get in shot and they had every day wrapping up their heads like mummies and going back on on patrol
04:41:58.74 --> 04:42:03.46 You know how I'm they're leader. Yeah, how can I leave them when they're doing that?
04:42:03.46 --> 04:42:07.62 And so that's my that's my response to that like look at it might and at that
04:42:08.34 --> 04:42:12.82 I would have done it the same way now. What I'm not leaving them no matter how badly I was hurt, you know
04:42:14.18 --> 04:42:17.62 But I get the criticism I do and so I get back to Fort Drum
04:42:18.02 --> 04:42:18.98 You know
04:42:18.98 --> 04:42:24.02 I start having vertigo and all these issues. I never have an surgery to get all the cerebral spinal fluid
04:42:24.42 --> 04:42:31.30 Remove from my sinus cavities because it's right in there that was terrible and then if going back to the traumatic brain injury clinic at Fort Drum
04:42:31.30 --> 04:42:37.78 and occupational therapy physical therapy like find motor skill stuff speech therapy just this round robin thing and
04:42:38.34 --> 04:42:43.70 My battalion was working up to go back again. I was made the rear detachment commander that was the worst job ever
04:42:43.70 --> 04:42:46.02 I was doing all casher unification for the guy so
04:42:46.82 --> 04:42:52.74 The crazy thing and again, I don't talk about it. You just like flew through that your your guys deploy again
04:42:52.82 --> 04:42:54.82 Yeah, my patreon. Yeah, you can't deploy
04:42:55.46 --> 04:42:59.14 Because of your injuries and so now you're stuck back in the rear and
04:42:59.14 --> 04:43:08.02 And the job they assign you with is what we call in the Navy we call it a cake-o officer casualty assistant calls officer
04:43:08.02 --> 04:43:12.90 What do you guys call me? Well, yeah, so we call it a CAO casualty assistant officer
04:43:12.90 --> 04:43:17.78 But I was the rear detachment commander as well. So it's my job to liais with all the wives and
04:43:18.50 --> 04:43:22.90 train the new recruits to go and take care of the wounded ones when they came back
04:43:23.38 --> 04:43:27.78 So every single soldier that was wounded it was my job to call and notify the family, right?
04:43:27.78 --> 04:43:29.78 and
04:43:29.78 --> 04:43:35.30 It cashiest assistant officer was like an every other month thing so we'd rotate there would be one cashiest assistant officer from the rear
04:43:35.30 --> 04:43:41.78 Yeah, and it rotate through the battions so every couple months I'd be the CAO where you're going to the doors and notifying family members
04:43:42.18 --> 04:43:47.70 I ended up going I have to tell you that that was that duty position was worse than combat because
04:43:48.66 --> 04:43:50.18 You know it's like when you're there
04:43:50.58 --> 04:43:55.46 You're like you just I just want to be the best leader that can be to get as many men as home as possible
04:43:55.46 --> 04:44:00.74 Right kills many bad guys as we can accomplish a mission get my boys home then he come back
04:44:01.70 --> 04:44:08.42 And get assigned the rear-dee commander job my men are given a different between leader third, you know a good puttune leader
04:44:08.42 --> 04:44:09.62 You know
04:44:09.62 --> 04:44:15.06 Where they train up they go back and now I'm the rear-dee commander and have to watch them as far as my buttune gets torn torn apart
04:44:15.62 --> 04:44:20.58 Just torn apart Jeff Hall died in that next deployment five my guys died in that next deployment
04:44:20.58 --> 04:44:25.30 It was just I had to go to their funeral as I had to meet with their families
04:44:25.30 --> 04:44:27.30 I had it just like here I did
04:44:27.30 --> 04:44:31.46 485 days of absolute hell where I would have done anything for these guys to get them home alive
04:44:31.46 --> 04:44:37.38 We finally do we go back to we go back to Afghanistan nine months later and all of a time just gets torn up
04:44:37.70 --> 04:44:41.86 Just torn up and I have to watch from afar as it happens. It was just just just hell
04:44:42.18 --> 04:44:44.42 It was just hell man. I just it's those guys
04:44:45.22 --> 04:44:49.14 Went through so much and they still they still they still struggling
04:44:49.14 --> 04:44:51.14 We lost men since I think
04:44:51.78 --> 04:44:58.90 I mean to this day we've lost more soldiers to suicide and accidents and things after the war that we actually
04:44:59.54 --> 04:45:01.86 Have in combat which is crazy
04:45:07.30 --> 04:45:10.18 You're you're on that duty. This is the last thing when I read from the book
04:45:10.18 --> 04:45:17.22 Two years earlier young man had walked into my office at four drum fresh faced and all smiles
04:45:17.62 --> 04:45:22.66 The kid had saluted me and told me that his uncle had told them to seek me out who's your uncle I asked
04:45:23.14 --> 04:45:27.54 Philip Baldwin sir. I want to serve with you and his old buttune. I'm Baldwin
04:45:28.18 --> 04:45:30.74 stunned. I said to him do you know your uncle is a hero?
04:45:31.38 --> 04:45:37.46 He shook his head. I told him the story of what Baldwin had done on June 10th when I finished I said to him
04:45:37.46 --> 04:45:41.14 You have some really big shoes to fill if I put you in the platoon
04:45:42.02 --> 04:45:44.02 You need to measure up
04:45:44.02 --> 04:45:49.62 Resilute steady eyes greeted those words. I could see he didn't cut from the same mold as his uncle
04:45:50.82 --> 04:45:56.18 Not only did he join third platoon his brother-in-law private Matthew Wilson did as well
04:45:56.74 --> 04:46:00.82 Third platoon had become more than a brotherhood. It had become a family
04:46:00.82 --> 04:46:08.10 Private Wilson was killed in action during the same attack that claimed sergeant Hall
04:46:09.86 --> 04:46:13.46 Baldwin's family had paid a terrible price for their love of country
04:46:14.98 --> 04:46:22.02 Now Wilson's coffin lay before us sealed with his body inside we stood back in the crowd alone with our thoughts
04:46:23.62 --> 04:46:27.06 That's when we noticed him a tall man wearing a black suit
04:46:27.06 --> 04:46:31.62 He had a go-teen now and he leaned heavily on a cane
04:46:32.42 --> 04:46:35.78 Is that Baldwin I asked he saw us and hobbled over
04:46:37.06 --> 04:46:41.86 Before words were exchanged our arms wrapped around each other in a fierce embrace
04:46:42.98 --> 04:46:50.90 Long into that desperate and sad moment. I could only think of how I'd last seen him. I can't feel my legs or I can't feel my legs
04:46:50.90 --> 04:46:56.58 As we talked among the crosses Baldwin's mother and grandmother walked up to us
04:46:57.54 --> 04:47:03.86 Philip turned to them and said mom grandma. I want you to meet the man who pulled me off the battle field and saved my life
04:47:08.82 --> 04:47:11.38 They drew me into their arms and told me I was family
04:47:12.34 --> 04:47:17.38 I held them close total strangers but still connected in ways most people will never fathom
04:47:17.38 --> 04:47:22.82 Thank you. Thank you for what you did for Phil. They said through streaming tears
04:47:25.38 --> 04:47:27.38 He is my brother
04:47:28.02 --> 04:47:30.02 Was all I could manage
04:47:31.46 --> 04:47:34.42 I held on and never wanted to let go
04:47:34.42 --> 04:47:45.46 I think you're right about that. I think that most people
04:47:46.98 --> 04:47:51.14 Will not ever be able to fathom that emotion right there
04:47:54.58 --> 04:47:56.58 and you were
04:47:56.58 --> 04:48:01.94 Kind of forced to leave that at the end of the day
04:48:02.82 --> 04:48:08.58 You were medically retired. Yeah, yeah, it was you know my batying got back from the second deployment
04:48:08.82 --> 04:48:12.42 They were gearing up for the third deployment. You know and I was I was put out
04:48:14.74 --> 04:48:19.30 I was put out. It was medically retired. It was terrible the way that it happened to went down
04:48:19.30 --> 04:48:23.78 It's just like you know you come down red as a captain in a battalion
04:48:23.78 --> 04:48:27.38 And a senior captain on my way to 04 my way to major
04:48:29.06 --> 04:48:33.70 And a battalion like there are only so many senior captain no four slots come down red in a powerpoint slide
04:48:33.70 --> 04:48:38.58 It's like we got to get this guy out of here and it's like I can't move any faster than the med board process
04:48:38.58 --> 04:48:40.74 You know it's like once it gets up to the big army
04:48:40.74 --> 04:48:44.98 It's a waiting game what takes forever you know there are a lot of guys wounded a lot of guys being medically retired
04:48:45.78 --> 04:48:47.78 The system was slow
04:48:47.78 --> 04:48:54.02 And so it's basically given that okay once my medical retirement paper came down and was approved my batying commander
04:48:54.58 --> 04:48:58.58 Like trying to get me out and get a new captain in and give me two days to clear for drum
04:48:58.58 --> 04:49:04.10 Got it put out of the army two days and look this isn't a soft story, but it's like two days to say goodbye to everybody
04:49:04.10 --> 04:49:06.74 That I lived my life with for the last six and a half years
04:49:07.54 --> 04:49:15.46 But that's the military man, you know there's a mission and that you know we move the scene keeps rolling. Yes. We moved that mission like a local motor freight train
04:49:15.46 --> 04:49:21.46 And if you're wounded or you're hurt like I get that I love that I respect that, you know, but you got to get out of the way of the train man
04:49:21.46 --> 04:49:23.46 That's just what it is so
04:49:24.58 --> 04:49:27.38 Insulent so then so now what years it?
04:49:28.66 --> 04:49:35.46 I was put out December 19th, 2010 and then what we had you already started writing the book?
04:49:35.46 --> 04:49:42.26 Yeah, I mean I was in the process of cobbling together the chapters in the outlines with minimal success
04:49:42.26 --> 04:49:47.78 You know I it because you're not a writer no, I mean you weren't a writer and I didn't understand the process the agent
04:49:47.78 --> 04:49:50.18 Pride me never like it was like drinking from a fire hose
04:49:50.18 --> 04:49:52.66 Did you did you know that you wanted a book to be published?
04:49:52.66 --> 04:49:56.66 That's it was the purpose of what you were doing absolutely I mean I knew it was my job as I mean
04:49:56.66 --> 04:49:59.38 I've the charge of command the charge of leadership is lifelong
04:49:59.38 --> 04:50:04.26 You have that that you were always be seen as as a leader of your men as long as you breathe
04:50:04.98 --> 04:50:09.14 And so it was my job if that's how I'm approaching the leadership philosophy
04:50:09.14 --> 04:50:14.58 It's my job to also make sure that their legacy is captured and enshrined on the page and so yeah, I wanted I wanted to
04:50:15.38 --> 04:50:19.22 I wanted to write a book and I wanted it to be published and I wanted to be in the library of Congress
04:50:19.22 --> 04:50:23.06 So if people wanted to learn about what my men did and the war of Afghanistan they could pull out out
04:50:23.06 --> 04:50:26.18 Lobotoon and read it and it was hard man. It was like
04:50:27.06 --> 04:50:33.38 Writing a book is really challenging selling it getting an agents even harder and then finding a publisher that would publish your shit is even harder than that and so
04:50:33.38 --> 04:50:38.82 Is this like could you just start writing and
04:50:39.70 --> 04:50:42.42 Figure that the rest of that stuff would come together as it came together
04:50:42.42 --> 04:50:48.42 I agent in the publisher. I started writing and writing and writing and wrote a proposal submitted to agents got
04:50:48.98 --> 04:50:50.98 Rejected by everyone I submitted it to
04:50:51.70 --> 04:50:55.62 Re-wrote it submitted to agents got rejected by everyone I submitted it to and eventually I just
04:50:56.02 --> 04:50:59.54 You know, it's like a learning experience for me is like I don't have this skill set. I need help
04:50:59.54 --> 04:51:05.62 You know and so then I started reading these military memoirs research in the market like doing everything
04:51:05.62 --> 04:51:11.54 I could just soak up knowledge on everything I could about the phases of publishing and I ended up reading
04:51:11.54 --> 04:51:16.34 House the house and a couple of other books that John Bruning and wrote and I'm like I love this this guy's perfect
04:51:16.34 --> 04:51:18.90 And I you know this is before like Facebook was a thing
04:51:19.14 --> 04:51:24.02 This was like it was like Facebook was in its infancy, you know and like I'm like on my space like trying to find the guy
04:51:24.02 --> 04:51:30.34 And I end up finding this this is no they like I'm stumbling across this is like my me slew thing on the internet
04:51:30.34 --> 04:51:33.86 You know stumbling across some cat website and I see the name Shirley
04:51:34.42 --> 04:51:39.86 I see the name Bruning right Sally Bruning I can't remember what this sister's name and turns out to be a sister
04:51:39.86 --> 04:51:41.86 I'm on this cat website
04:51:41.86 --> 04:51:42.90 These cats
04:51:42.90 --> 04:51:47.14 I'm a writer to the email on our website and I'm like, man, you know my name Sean Parnell
04:51:47.70 --> 04:51:52.26 The hostick like my guys were in Afghanistan. We got a tough deployment. I'm desperate to
04:51:52.26 --> 04:51:57.46 Meet your brother if if you are indeed a sister and I think you might be
04:51:57.86 --> 04:51:59.86 Can you please put me in contact with them?
04:52:00.58 --> 04:52:04.18 Like long shot man, and then I remember like sitting there in front of the computer. I'm like
04:52:04.18 --> 04:52:08.58 Oh, I don't want to send this email. I saw like a tool like she's the work of the cop
04:52:09.78 --> 04:52:11.78 It's like cat website
04:52:12.74 --> 04:52:16.82 Yeah, and so I did no week later I get an email from Bruning and I had a phone call with him and
04:52:16.82 --> 04:52:22.34 And after I I belong to it takes for him to comprehend the story that you had
04:52:23.46 --> 04:52:29.06 And I told him briefly we had about we had an hour phone conversation if he goes this is
04:52:30.26 --> 04:52:37.94 This is like the craziest infantry story I've ever heard he's like this this we need to get this book out there and John just became
04:52:38.98 --> 04:52:41.78 I mean, he just was so inspired by
04:52:41.78 --> 04:52:47.38 My men he went to Afghanistan himself just to do the research to learn about it
04:52:47.38 --> 04:52:51.54 It's the smells the sights the sounds he just wanted to experience it and
04:52:52.50 --> 04:52:54.50 I mean he just
04:52:54.50 --> 04:52:58.90 He was all in man and when when when when he was all in we had a great creative vibe
04:52:58.90 --> 04:53:02.90 You know and that that's really hard to come by you know it's hard to come by a guy that's just
04:53:03.30 --> 04:53:10.02 Your personalities mesh that creatives mesh and I mean we worked 12 hours a day on that book and ended up signing with an agent and
04:53:10.02 --> 04:53:14.02 And the agent that had rejected me two or three times already
04:53:14.58 --> 04:53:20.66 But it's like that's life man, you know so much of life is like and how many times you knock on that door and the answer is until your knuckles bleed
04:53:21.06 --> 04:53:23.06 If that don't work you got to kick that fuck already
04:53:25.06 --> 04:53:32.50 Sorry dropping up bombs on your podcast, but but I promised I wouldn't do that no, but but so I ended up submitting this proposal
04:53:32.50 --> 04:53:41.06 Which I thought was awesome to all the big five publishers gets rejected by everyone at least I thought every one of them at the time and I'm like up in some
04:53:41.38 --> 04:53:45.62 You know Walmart pool like crying in my beer and like I failed my mission
04:53:45.62 --> 04:53:51.94 But still like I'm publishing this on a curve. I have to self publish it three or four months go by I hear nothing
04:53:51.94 --> 04:53:55.70 You know how that process goes you know and you're never just did dad and hurt anything
04:53:55.86 --> 04:53:58.58 I get a call from my agent and he's like hey, you know
04:53:58.58 --> 04:54:06.26 David high fill from William Maro Harper Collins like love this like he wants to buy it and then that a read the email is like
04:54:06.26 --> 04:54:08.58 I've been on vacation you know broad for a while
04:54:08.58 --> 04:54:12.10 I stumbled across this I don't think that there's no way that this could still be available
04:54:12.10 --> 04:54:14.10 But I want it and so
04:54:14.10 --> 04:54:18.10 Soldered to David and I've been publishing with William Maro ever since and
04:54:19.86 --> 04:54:25.30 It was just I've sort of given the clip those version of the of my publishing experience up into that point
04:54:25.30 --> 04:54:29.54 Trying to get an agent trying to get a publisher. Oh my god the game is it's exhausting, but
04:54:30.18 --> 04:54:34.82 You know bringing burning on board is what really made it happen. I didn't have that skill set to do it
04:54:34.82 --> 04:54:39.94 He you know I can write a good op-ed like a good history paper with a writing a good story
04:54:39.94 --> 04:54:41.38 Well, no, he did a great job
04:54:41.38 --> 04:54:45.38 I mean just talking to you for the last how many hours 12 or whatever
04:54:45.38 --> 04:54:48.26 It's been a week long pod
04:54:48.26 --> 04:54:53.62 Yeah, but but he did a great job because you know the book sounds like you the book reads like you
04:54:53.62 --> 04:54:58.50 So he's he's he's since become just an amazing friend and he's
04:55:00.10 --> 04:55:04.66 He's he's the most prolific military right I mean he's he wrote the trident to with Jay Redden and
04:55:06.18 --> 04:55:08.18 He's you know my gosh
04:55:08.90 --> 04:55:11.62 Levels er heroes come Blaskey about marine
04:55:12.02 --> 04:55:12.82 Raiders
04:55:12.82 --> 04:55:15.94 Me's he's written a couple of seal books. I mean the guys just
04:55:16.98 --> 04:55:21.06 Right's about World War II the latest latest book is indestructible. I mean I'm the guy's just prolific
04:55:21.06 --> 04:55:29.22 He's awesome is a great writer and he and more than that he's a he's a legit historian that knows his stuff with a deep reverence
04:55:29.22 --> 04:55:36.90 For the military and the legacy of the warrior and he's just he gets it that's awesome and so the book comes out
04:55:37.54 --> 04:55:43.22 The book the book does great right? Yeah, it did it did but it was like it was not expected
04:55:43.22 --> 04:55:47.54 It like it so it was not expected to see nobody I mean like I was the newbie
04:55:47.54 --> 04:55:52.82 I was the captain like nobody really knew what to do they changed the cover five times like I didn't have any media
04:55:52.82 --> 04:55:55.62 Contacts or anything and the book comes out and
04:55:56.50 --> 04:56:01.86 It debuted on the list like it debuted on the New York Times best cellos. I think I don't think it did
04:56:01.86 --> 04:56:05.46 I think it was like 10 might even been 12 or something but I was like
04:56:06.58 --> 04:56:08.98 Holy shit like this is crazy and
04:56:09.30 --> 04:56:13.86 Not only that it started ascending as the weeks went on and so it was the New York Times best cellos
04:56:13.86 --> 04:56:20.18 I think I think we're like 28 weeks or something like that again. I mean no one expected it
04:56:20.90 --> 04:56:26.18 Um and then it came off the list and then around Christmas time that year went back on the list and it's been
04:56:26.98 --> 04:56:31.46 Boomerang and on and off the list ever since which is just sort of crazy. Yeah, that's awesome
04:56:31.94 --> 04:56:34.90 You know, I think you know at the end of the day people just
04:56:35.46 --> 04:56:36.50 They just
04:56:36.50 --> 04:56:41.38 They take the book they read it and they pass it on to their friend and that's that's what it's all about that's why I wrote that book
04:56:41.38 --> 04:56:46.34 You know and so and so and so then you also started working with businesses started talking
04:56:46.34 --> 04:56:50.98 Yes, I was doing speaking engagements and that's what you're still doing yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I do I talk about
04:56:51.70 --> 04:56:58.02 I talk about you know my experience in the military at tell tell combat stories talk about leadership as well
04:56:58.02 --> 04:57:01.94 Servant leadership is you know this sort of the style that I stumbled upon
04:57:02.58 --> 04:57:05.30 And I talk about that talk about whether corporations and you know
04:57:05.30 --> 04:57:07.94 I've sort of started doing some executive coaching as well
04:57:07.94 --> 04:57:12.58 Which is sort of like I'm kind of like that. I just like dialogue like we're happened about leadership and stuff
04:57:15.38 --> 04:57:19.30 More than that is like having the opportunity to learn with people that are a lot smarter than me too
04:57:19.30 --> 04:57:25.62 You know so coaching is in a one way street you get to learn you know from each other and so it's it's great to be able to learn from some
04:57:25.70 --> 04:57:29.54 Leaders that have been able to hone their skills in the corporate world for a really long time and
04:57:30.74 --> 04:57:33.38 And I've got an on profit now where where well
04:57:33.38 --> 04:57:37.14 I'm I'm part of I say I'm I'm part of a non-profit now

04:57:41.62 --> 04:57:49.14 We're a little bit about that well. I mean so we are we're partnered with an amazing mortgage company fairway mortgage you spoke with their event. They're like
04:57:50.10 --> 04:57:54.90 They're right group. They're a group of people and look man people people don't realize how special that company
04:57:54.90 --> 04:57:59.14 Truly is and I mean it from a cultural leadership standpoint that they are a

04:58:03.78 --> 04:58:10.26 But they're the fourth or fifth largest mortgage company in the world precise because everybody wants to work for them

04:58:27.86 --> 04:58:32.50 And so Jake just basically told Luis that's then who is my co-founder said look
04:58:32.50 --> 04:58:38.50 You know they served us now it's our turn to serve them figure out a program where we can give back take this

04:58:43.54 --> 04:58:48.50 Give 100% over the pro seats and donations to veterans and now we sort of pivoted to give in away service dogs
04:58:48.98 --> 04:58:56.10 To vets and it's been awesome. It's been it's been an amazing thing just to be able to give back to people who have given everything
04:58:56.74 --> 04:59:00.50 And then at some point along the way you decided you're gonna write more books
04:59:00.50 --> 04:59:05.78 Yeah, yeah, I must have my shagrin. Yeah, I just told you about how the writing process is you know
04:59:05.78 --> 04:59:10.66 It's like you're like button for punished. It's like learning the right of bicycle without a seat
04:59:11.30 --> 04:59:13.06 While on fire, you know
04:59:13.62 --> 04:59:18.58 Yeah, you know I did I was so you wrote the first one that you wrote after outlaw was man of war
04:59:18.66 --> 04:59:21.94 Yes, these are these are now novels. Yes, they're thrillers. Yeah, so
04:59:23.14 --> 04:59:27.14 I always wanted to like I'm from Pittsburgh so like I'm a big stealer's fan my protagonist
04:59:27.14 --> 04:59:33.06 Hero's name is Eric steel and also also secretly like I had this brigade commander in Afghanistan in the 82nd Airborne
04:59:33.06 --> 04:59:36.10 Came in it was the name was Colonel steel STEL
04:59:36.10 --> 04:59:38.10 E and the guy who's like six eight
04:59:38.66 --> 04:59:43.54 Mass above Mike you know what man if I ever if I ever accomplished my dreams and start writing fiction
04:59:43.54 --> 04:59:47.38 You know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna name my protagonist steel because it works in a lot of different levels
04:59:47.38 --> 04:59:49.38 So I did and
04:59:49.86 --> 04:59:52.50 You know I just I just Eric steals background
04:59:52.50 --> 04:59:58.26 So Eric steals a former special forces guy former Greenberry his special forces team gets overrun
04:59:59.30 --> 05:00:02.98 in Afghanistan he's he's one of two survivors put in for the metal of honor
05:00:04.90 --> 05:00:08.34 The award itself has stopped and it's tracks and he's recruited for a secret
05:00:09.78 --> 05:00:12.02 Government program called the alpha program and
05:00:13.14 --> 05:00:20.90 The alpha program there's nine alphas at any given time in the world each responsible for a different geographic area of the world and it's based
05:00:20.90 --> 05:00:25.38 The alphas are basically the president's third option where you know all out war
05:00:26.10 --> 05:00:32.50 Diplomacy fails he's president since in an outfit it kick ass and take names and fix a situation and there's only nine of them
05:00:32.50 --> 05:00:36.18 Eric steals the youngest most talented operator and so man of war
05:00:37.30 --> 05:00:43.22 Throws Eric into a situation it's my first book through his Eric into an impossible situation against somebody that's an impossible enemy
05:00:43.78 --> 05:00:48.90 He ends up establishing himself and learning a very important lesson that most warriors learn in the battlefields
05:00:48.90 --> 05:00:51.62 It no matter how hard you try you can't save everybody you know
05:00:53.06 --> 05:00:56.26 Mostly the reason why I wanted to create this character is because I feel like
05:00:57.54 --> 05:00:59.06 You know
05:00:59.54 --> 05:01:04.10 Our culture in this genre specifically is a wash with like the anti heroes you know
05:01:05.94 --> 05:01:07.86 Bragged it yeah, you know
05:01:08.66 --> 05:01:13.70 He drinks a lot but he's got a heart of gold, you know like that guy, you know and I just wanted to create a character
05:01:13.70 --> 05:01:19.30 Who was good he was good to the core of his being and that good is exploited right and a number of different ways
05:01:19.30 --> 05:01:24.50 Bad guys find it sees upon it to exploit that there's the story they put him in impossible situations
05:01:24.50 --> 05:01:29.70 You know you choose between the Syrian woman being raped and the mission what do you choose right?
05:01:30.02 --> 05:01:33.38 But the reason why I did this and I wanted to create this characters because
05:01:33.86 --> 05:01:39.38 He embodies the greatness and the heroism of what I of the of the men that I witnessed on the battlefield these guys
05:01:39.38 --> 05:01:46.50 Deserve and they are I think our country do a certain extent deserves a mainstream fiction here with an embodies honor and
05:01:46.66 --> 05:01:49.54 Tegrety selfless as duty love of country and
05:01:50.34 --> 05:01:54.98 Love of the preservation of innocent life right I think at the core of the American warrior
05:01:54.98 --> 05:02:01.30 We are protectors and we are liberators right that's part of who we are and that's who he is as well and I think Eric steel
05:02:02.26 --> 05:02:08.02 You know he's he's the biggest fastest strongest smartest guy and often times he can you know
05:02:08.02 --> 05:02:14.18 He can save the woman in Syria has been raped and still accomplished the mission because he is who he is right
05:02:15.94 --> 05:02:21.78 But sometimes as you know in combat like there are impossible situations, you know where you have to choose very
05:02:21.78 --> 05:02:24.34 Literally between human life and the mission and
05:02:25.30 --> 05:02:31.62 Sometimes as leaders we have to make those calculations on a split second basis and so Eric steel is presented with those situations
05:02:31.62 --> 05:02:37.22 Time and time again in these books and the first book he is he figures out he can't save everybody and the second book the theme is
05:02:37.22 --> 05:02:39.78 You know and themes are oftentimes like in the background
05:02:39.78 --> 05:02:44.58 Maybe they're not consciously recognized as readers a fiction, but the theme is are you a man or are you a slave?
05:02:44.90 --> 05:02:48.98 You know and the villain that he faces in the book is like the bad version of himself
05:02:48.98 --> 05:02:54.02 That's been tasked out by the Russian government to find and kill and target enemies of of Russia
05:02:54.74 --> 05:02:57.22 And the villain that he faces it's like
05:02:57.78 --> 05:03:04.74 Second tired of being a slave so he's just gonna take the fight to everybody that he deems a king and Eric steel is sort of it's the same thing right like
05:03:04.74 --> 05:03:10.58 Eric steel was a servant to the United States and the difference is he's a servant not a slave and so that's the theme and
05:03:10.82 --> 05:03:12.10 No, I always try to
05:03:12.10 --> 05:03:16.38 Pit Eric steel up against villains that would be his greatest enemy and again
05:03:16.38 --> 05:03:19.22 Not unlike situations that's all just facing the battlefield all the time
05:03:19.54 --> 05:03:21.54 So that's the one that's coming out
05:03:21.78 --> 05:03:29.42 Yeah, all out war comes out on September. Oh, yeah, man of war came out last year third. Yeah, here's a little extra
05:03:29.42 --> 05:03:35.50 Because sometimes I just get fired up to read a little while you basically read half of out all but tune on the air
05:03:35.50 --> 05:03:37.98 And it was awesome. I'm like I want you read all my audio books now
05:03:38.38 --> 05:03:40.70 No offense to RC Bra who's epic, but you know
05:03:40.70 --> 05:03:43.42 You've got to think going there. I think you I think you could do it
05:03:43.66 --> 05:03:46.30 So we're digging into this this is all out war
05:03:46.94 --> 05:03:51.10 Flap steel dove behind the poojoan yank the high power from his waistband
05:03:51.10 --> 05:03:57.18 He crawled toward the engine block heart hammering in his chest at the realization that someone had just tried to kill him in broad daylight
05:03:57.18 --> 05:04:02.22 The metropolitan police didn't hide the fact that they installed cameras on every block
05:04:02.54 --> 05:04:09.18 The operated on the theory that if criminals knew they were going to be recorded they might think twice before breaking the law
05:04:10.30 --> 05:04:12.70 Whoever had taken a shot at him didn't give his shit
05:04:13.34 --> 05:04:20.74 Because instead of running away the shooter flick the selector switch to full auto and opened up on steel's hiding place
05:04:20.98 --> 05:04:26.88 Flap flap the poojo swayed onto the onslaught the car rocked on its hinges the bullets blasting
05:04:26.88 --> 05:04:31.84 Star shape holes through the aluminum skin as the shooter rake the car from stem to stern
05:04:32.72 --> 05:04:35.52 Steel's plan was to hit him on the reload
05:04:36.000 --> 05:04:38.000 But he never got the chance
05:04:38.72 --> 05:04:43.60 Before the shooter ran through his first magazine a second opened up the bullets cut across the hood
05:04:43.92 --> 05:04:46.96 Punching through the metal with the sound of rocks on a tin roof
05:04:48.000 --> 05:04:51.20 Steel judged that he had been under fire for less than 30 seconds
05:04:51.92 --> 05:04:53.92 But in a gunfight
05:04:53.92 --> 05:04:55.92 Time was subjective
05:04:58.48 --> 05:05:02.56 There you go you got a knack for this man. Yeah, yeah, well, I like you know
05:05:02.56 --> 05:05:07.64 I started this whole thing off about talking about the the way that time slows down
05:05:07.64 --> 05:05:09.92 Yes, and that's what I liked about this piece. It's like yes
05:05:10.32 --> 05:05:16.96 you someone that's writing this that actually understands that that understands what it's like to have
05:05:17.44 --> 05:05:21.84 Bullets cut you know hitting the roof like that's what I think makes these
05:05:21.84 --> 05:05:27.68 That's where the power comes from and these things, right? You've got the character that's truly good
05:05:28.08 --> 05:05:32.08 And you've got someone that's writing them that's been through these situations. So
05:05:33.52 --> 05:05:38.96 Yeah, I hope I mean I think people I mean people like these books so far. I'm right in a third one
05:05:39.28 --> 05:05:41.28 There's gonna be at least two more out
05:05:41.92 --> 05:05:47.28 And you know I just feel like this country we we talk a lot about
05:05:47.28 --> 05:05:52.64 We ask the question does America understand the metal of her warrior sons, right?
05:05:53.60 --> 05:05:56.72 That's a question I've asked myself since outlobitoon came out
05:05:57.04 --> 05:06:02.48 This character embodies all the greatest aspects of the warrior ethos that I witnessed in my soldiers on the battlefield
05:06:03.04 --> 05:06:08.72 And all of these books that the whole reason I write him is to help answer that question does America
05:06:08.88 --> 05:06:12.24 Understand the metal of her warrior sons, right?
05:06:12.24 --> 05:06:17.52 You know writing on fiction is one way right to do that to they could people can pick up out
05:06:17.52 --> 05:06:21.28 Lobitoon they can read it they can get a sense of what it was like on the battlefield boots on the ground
05:06:21.68 --> 05:06:25.84 A lot of people don't read nonfiction and fiction is another way another audience
05:06:26.48 --> 05:06:34.000 It's another way to get that those types of values in front of Americans to help them understand to help that bridge that cultural gap between
05:06:35.12 --> 05:06:37.12 You know veterans and
05:06:37.12 --> 05:06:42.96 Warriors in society and people and citizens who reap the blessings of freedom on a day-to-day basis
05:06:43.20 --> 05:06:48.000 You know it's all about reaching a wider audience and I think these books give people an opportunity to do that
05:06:48.88 --> 05:06:50.88 Yeah, no, well, that's
05:06:51.44 --> 05:06:53.44 Yeah, that's awesome. So
05:06:54.24 --> 05:06:56.88 We got the books people will get these books
05:06:57.52 --> 05:07:01.44 They'll definitely get out of law of the tune like I said I had read a fraction of it today
05:07:01.44 --> 05:07:03.04 You said I read half and I didn't even come close
05:07:03.04 --> 05:07:07.20 Um, but because there's so much more in there and I'll tell you what it was really hard for me
05:07:08.08 --> 05:07:11.84 To pick out what sections I wanted to read because so many sections
05:07:12.24 --> 05:07:17.92 There's so much information there not just about what happened in the experiences about about about leadership
05:07:18.48 --> 05:07:20.48 So yeah
05:07:20.48 --> 05:07:22.48 awesome books and
05:07:22.48 --> 05:07:24.48 I think I think you're gonna see some people
05:07:25.04 --> 05:07:31.20 Trying to get a hold of them what else you got the American Warrior initiative dot com is there like can you donate on that page?
05:07:31.20 --> 05:07:36.72 Yes, yes, and one of the things that our charity does is it gives you the opportunity to earmark your donation
05:07:36.72 --> 05:07:38.40 So if you want to donate for a service dog

05:07:44.48 --> 05:07:45.52 So
05:07:45.52 --> 05:07:49.92 We just want to give people a sense that if they want to do a day-to-is and we're honored to have it
05:07:50.72 --> 05:07:55.20 We want to make sure that people are getting the best bank for their buck and we want people to feel like they're a part of it and

05:12:07.68 --> 05:12:12.88 Quarity some cookies in the game we all need some cookies do you like mint chocolate chip do you like can do mention
05:12:13.60 --> 05:12:14.16 That was a week the
05:12:14.16 --> 05:12:18.08 And I should do it the milk is for you. It's cool. Maybe more. It's for me
05:12:18.08 --> 05:12:20.08 I want it's good for me
05:12:21.36 --> 05:12:26.56 Shocked yes, we do have chocolate. We have strawberry which is amazing. We have peanut butter which is
05:12:27.28 --> 05:12:32.96 Equally amazing this strawberry might be a little amazing and then we have mint chocolate chip which is see this is what's nice
05:12:32.96 --> 05:12:38.88 If you would have started this supplement company guess what flavor you would have could be cookie cream
05:12:38.88 --> 05:12:44.08 Do whatever you just said. It's just yes. You started this supplement company. I did I guess what we have number one
05:12:44.16 --> 05:12:48.80 Mint chocolate chip. That's my favorite flavor. Is that your favorite flavor? Hell yeah number two peanut butter
05:12:48.88 --> 05:12:52.64 What's my second favorite? Yes, that's number two number three strawberry
05:12:53.20 --> 05:12:55.84 So we went right in the orders of things that I like now
05:12:57.12 --> 05:13:01.20 In your image if you're kind of on board with the program we can work on some cookies and cream
05:13:01.20 --> 05:13:05.44 Of course some on board. I mean I feel like cookies and cream is a very mainstream idea and concept
05:13:05.44 --> 05:13:08.24 It actually tastes I would agree with that
05:13:09.28 --> 05:13:11.44 It just sort of maybe slipped under the radar
05:13:11.68 --> 05:13:15.44 Because you like cookies and cream not not not not gonna buy it like actively
05:13:15.76 --> 05:13:21.76 So maybe I would it's odd that that shines like oh I can do mint chocolate chip
05:13:22.56 --> 05:13:25.68 Usually mint chocolate chip is either like oh man. I don't mess with the mint
05:13:25.92 --> 05:13:30.24 Chon that's just junk ore. That's my favorite. I feel like it's really polar like that
05:13:30.24 --> 05:13:36.000 Yeah, I feel like why go with mint chocolate chip when there are so many good chocolatey goodness tastes like chocolate regular
05:13:36.000 --> 05:13:40.16 Chockett or cookies and cream or cookie. Okay, look this may be none of topic we need to talk about our ex
05:13:40.16 --> 05:13:43.20 I'm starting to get a little bit you know frustrated at the whole thing
05:13:44.16 --> 05:13:46.96 People being anti I didn't chocolate. I know that is
05:13:47.52 --> 05:13:49.52 I got it in my opinion

05:23:22.98 --> 05:23:24.98 Life can be rough and

05:23:29.14 --> 05:23:32.94 Sustained combat operations, but in most cases
05:23:32.94 --> 05:23:38.94 There's no one trying to kill you. There's no one assaulting you in your team with a wide array of devastating weapons
05:23:38.94 --> 05:23:40.94 Looking to come and cut your head off
05:23:40.94 --> 05:23:42.94 But
05:23:43.82 --> 05:23:53.20 Whatever you are facing you can make it through and the best way to do that is to do what outlaw platoon did take the fight to the enemy
05:23:53.20 --> 05:23:58.04 Be default aggressive don't sit back and allow bad things to put you on your heels
05:23:58.76 --> 05:24:00.76 go on the offense
05:24:00.76 --> 05:24:04.74 Counter attack aggressively and get after it
