and then it was it was large scale now it's going to be desert because after 1991 then Somalia happens right there so there's more of a middle eastern focus that's now shifting into this whole training paradigm that's there mixed in with these humanitarian missions like Haiti and everything else that's happening so you've got forces all over the place and the funny thing is I really truly do hope that in places in the government and in higher places in uniform above and beyond where you and I ever achieved to be at you really do hope that that mentality did not sip in and they started to promulgate it down to do that because that would just tell you that the people that were relying on to know the most about the business of doing warfare don't know as much that we actually believe that they do because if everything in the context from 1775 all the way up to present day of America is a blueprint for what is going to happen in the next 20 to 25 years and it is un-disputable and a training environment to actually think that we are not going to be fighting another large scale or at this time period while in between that time period are going to go in fight and four and five other shitty little engagements around the thing the Somalia as the Haiti's bigger and eight is going to happen and those are going to be compartmentalized not everybody gets to go to that party and then you got to keep your motivation up you got to train the troops and say that that's that units mission this time ours will be common ours will do that if you are going to make a career of a lengthy career in the US military you are going to go to war and there are other services that are going to go parts and pieces maybe before you but you trained them differently to say that you know these kind of things in the past only actually and boldened the culture when you do that to somebody to fight them even harder imagine somebody coming in and mutilating your mother or doing something after that and you believe that that's going to suppress you and amount of hatred to not want to go and do whatever you can to do that so all those little steps along the way of a of a 162 guys of a rifle company you know you watch a band of brothers and then you're sitting here going man in 2004 I wouldn't part of the five of those parish unit infantry by a de Bestem American in America so we're seeing since that time frame in this city once that piece deal I don't know what else to call it cease fire deal was brokered what was arrested at the point of like it was now just going through the city and doing reparations payments through the city and we would set up things on a Monday that was probably even more dangerous than combat because they you'd bring them to the same place same day same time they would line up you'd be driving through the city and you'd do talking knocks on there are you claiming any damage that the Americans did on your house or did you lose this on and combat did you do something like this then that's where you find out how they fabricate multiple desertificates and they're trying to get money from the Americans and it was just it was a lot of that it was then a lot of going back into the town to then again say that you know we don't want to fight meaning if you will give you a fight if you want it but let's kind of get back to doing what it was we were here to stabilize this and help you out I think that's a pretty good deal one less infantry battalion than the rest and they cover the most ground it's out there in a Pacific from northern China all the way to Darwin and best one of the best fighting regiments it's story they're the China marines they're not they're not they're operations in China fourth marines at the China marines but third marines has quite a legacy um and a legacy that goes back to rawfiel paraulta legacy of these battions going in out of Afghanistan my rock because when larger battions got longer to all ratios when you had one less battalion in a regiment that usually has four that's in there plus what they have and you have three systematically they have to deploy more it goes out so now you're kind of in charge of a regiment that's got one of the highest deployment tempos and also like the highest divorce rate in the entire United States Marine Corps because they live in paradise but they're never there you know the families are on that island but their loved ones are out training and to do all you're training and why you have to leave Hawaii to do it so on your dwell time like you had said before dwell in dwell dwell for some places in the backyard as well and other places when you can't train in your backyard you have to fly to California fly to the big island fly to do different things like that all your dwell time then turns into training time then that's how long was that tour that was about two and a half years and what is that what is that bring you after that they brought me up to a two star command at training and education command for the US Marine Corps out of Quantico Virginia and that's where eventually we figured finished out of up there and that was was that 30 years that was a 30 years at what point did you start getting involved in history flight about 2019 time frame um we got a package in the Marine Corps for an honorary Marine was a guy in the Mark Nilla and we'd started reading through this package and the general officer that I worked for was the guy that originally did the nomination when he was in charge of the Second Marine Division and he was now the Ticom commanding general this comes in and general done for is going to make this man an honorary Marine he wants us to do the ceremony so we go over the National Museum of the Marine Corps Mark Nilla in his family comes up we host them for a couple of days yet I saw the video today though good job good down with that one also e f overwatch if you need leaders in your organization we have experienced battle tested leaders e f overwatch dot com if you're in the military go there we can link you up with companies if you're company you need that leadership go to e f overwatch dot com fill out the appropriate information for yourself for charities like I said history flight dot com if you want to support the recovery of these heroes around the world also they have at history flight on instagram so check that out and then of course we got momily marklies mom and her organization america's mighty warriors dot org she does all kinds of things to help service members whether that's medical treatments that they couldn't get through military channels whether it's things that they need while they're over on deployment whether it's gold star families that need some some kind of support after they've lost their loved one she does all kinds of things like this so go to america's mighty warriors dot org if you want to get involved or if you want to donate and if for some unknown reason you just feel like you need to hear more of my disproportionately dallying discourse or you feel like you need more of echoes confiscated conceptualizations then you can find us on the inner webs on twitter instagram and on facebook echo is at echo trowels and i am at jocca willink and thanks once again to Justin LaHue for coming on for sharing the lessons with us we thank you for your service and we absolutely wish you godspeed in your mission today to continue to bring home our fallen country men and a solemn thanks to all that have fought for our freedom but did not return and of course thanks to all the service men and women who are out there today holding the line training to hold the line taking risk to hold the line to protect our freedom thanks to all of you and to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders thank you for holding the line and protecting us here on the home front and to everyone else out there you can learn a lot i learn a lot from a man like sergeant major Justin LaHue try try to eat his advice his advice to do whatever it takes to initiate savage action and aggression to establish a winning mentality and to do things not for yourself but for your country there is something bigger than you so go out there and get after it then until next time this is echo and jockel out but it helps augment we have a burn rate I go at 10,000 dollars a day to try to locate these that's this one one day for two teams to exist to try to find these american eras on TARWA and that is just operations on TARWA if you expand that out to do one crash sites in Europe looking for boys in the casserine pass for anything else on that that just greatly increases the costs rates that are up there and time equipment security of US remains like we have in this COVID time period on TARWA and just going out and and raising what you can to do what you said you know how can you put a dollar value on hey it's one of those things you look around and you're just like we made a promise to people years ago I can't imagine what it was like to get a telegraph the western union telling you on Christmas Eve that your son's not coming home which many of our veterans from TARW whether a family's got that on December 23rd they just happened to show up at the house to do that merry Christmas or or the Sullivan brothers or something like this it isn't here and that's a bad telegram to get but the telegrams that really break my heart is roughly the telegrams that you can see in the national archives from like 1949 and those are the telegrams that were sent to families that said not only is your son been killed and he's not coming home or no longer looking for them I can only imagine being a mother sitting there reading four years later after writing letter after letter after letter to hap Arnold or to whoever would listen can you give me some whereabouts of my boy can I have some fun where are they at shove Vaseline up in whom he's noses put everything else the corpsman start doing that and then we talk of these dead bodies into these things put the machine gunners and people on the roof to pin the snipers down and run those net Iraqi bodies across the street and put them in a house when I put them in a house so this is another thing that I don't really like to tolerate about all these people that they try to paint US troops is they're just barbarians that are put them in a house pull them in the house and actually when they put them down inside the house I said face their heads towards Maka they were fighters they you know people call them shit heads or they were hopped up they were in search or whatever I have a little bit of a respect of another human being I may not believe in what you're doing but he picked up a rifle he did whatever he was going to do for whatever that guy believed in and was trying to kill me and on the field about or we just got one up on him that was here so put them inside of there turn them cover them with this pile of rocks that was there because the wild dogs start to go through there and then over the next 24 hours that's all you heard all night was the wild dogs beating their head to get into that building to start tearing at the bodies then the next morning these same landscourt rules that you're seeing that made you start that in the first place you're seeing them just go like would you look at that and you see a dog rolled down the street like with a foot hanging out of its mouth like it's and I just wanted to kind of just just go through real quick here because when I read them each one of them you know as I sat there silently read my email I just kind of said they're nodding my heads and yep number one whatever it takes number two savage action and aggression in combat and in life number three in total combat and warfare you will get punched in the face number four no excuses don't have a victim mentality number five never leave a fallen comrade behind both in and out of the military number six moral and ethical leadership both in and out of combat number seven take total responsibility number eight always in the fight and never out of it number nine do what it takes to build the best team number ten except blame and shoulder burdens number eleven set your ego aside for the good of the collective number twelve establish and reinforce a winning mentality on and off the battlefield number thirteen be part of the solution not part of the problem number fourteen leadership is about people and getting the best from them and from yourself number fifteen be a man or woman of character number sixteen live an honorable and valourous life and number seventeen not for self but for country some things don't really even need further discussion and that's what I liked about that list as I read through it like I said I just nodded my head um unbelievable guidance from your life from your thirty years in the military from your heroic actions and not just your own heroic actions but for all the heroes that you saw around you and you know to me that's what this is about you know you set in this example you put in these words and you continuing to live a life of service to go out there and bring home these heroes I'll leave it to you for any other closing thoughts you might have right now so it's kind of knowing your marines in the rough time how it benefits the skills that you can have I know you can drive get in there he calls off and we get in there and drop the casual I get called over because I call my gun or he's sorry it's on the fab that's left back with my weapons puttone and said go over to this other unit tell all my need the machine gunners tell them they're going to need to put people up in those things to do this and we're taking on machine gunners and we're going back in a city with these guys I knew I'd be there by now all that machine guns came out loaded up we're all rolling in a city before we rolled out I took him out went back in the city jackel had to make another run that was back out and somehow a lieutenant colonel was up with the mu headquarters and come in and he had said if that SOB gets back on here again I want to see before it goes out love him to death lieutenant colonel johnson I walked up in there still covered going from head to toe and he was carrying like an MP5 on his back and he grabbed me got real close and so I go out as many times as we can the archaeologists go out about six week rotations they come back for about four weeks they go back out it's in there and systematically we were hoping within five years to process that entire eye went to the fullest it's not possible because they're still roughly approximately 400 and has been identified jacco the whole organization has recovered over 337 sets of missing American remains up front 130 plus have been positively identified the other moons are in the possession of the DNA labs and that so these are going to be more success stories each week each month of all the moons that are already in there and then on top of that you have operations and Europe you have operations and the Philippines you've got the US government in Vietnam you've got everybody out there doing what they can and then we as a private organization augment the skills that the US government out there 78,000 people probably a lot or naval casualties as you know you probably get roughly 28,000 that are able to be accessed that are here and if you're talking about a recovery rate of the government it about 200 of those a year on their own they're going to be doing this hundreds of years and they're never going to be able to catch that and these things whether it's forestry, whether it's city development, whether it's anything else you have the the loss is going to happen each year to where possibly some of these areas that you could have recovered a previous year are not accessible a year or two from now so you're always racing in its time and especially with the World War II generation you're really racing against the wrong time meaning we have young right when named Wendell Perkins that as a TAR was survivor and a veteran so yes so make the most of it you know kind of kind of that old thing make the most of it everyone's in a while you know like you'll get injured like something that'll take you out like for you know like a month like a month or more recovery time or whatever so that for that month you can't really do certain things if not like a lot of things and then when you finally heal up and are able to do it you have that like appreciation for just everyday stuff and that happens everybody's going to the big one 1820s were fighting insurrection with Indians you're fighting a different kind of warfare it's that insurgent small warfare again it's clear and then all of a sudden some way pops in and starts going we're going to Mexico everybody's going to Mexico City then you compartmentalize that then you get 1861 to 65 the whole show goes to town following that 60s and 70s then you hit the Spanish American war that comes in just after the Spanish American war war war one kicks off banana wars happen after that we start learning how to develop an amphibious doctrine throughout the Pacific guys like Pete Ellis are out there saying that the Japanese are going to strike into Pacific we have people in jungle training like Chesteepuller and all those learning these jungle skills in Nicaragua in Haiti and all these small little wars at that time period and a lot of guys are then asking you are we authorized to return fire to do this because that was probably the biggest thing that happened in Nazarea was that epic scope and scale of it you would think that people were itch in the pool the trigger it was quite the opposite they were really running the rules of engagement and saying until I get some real positive idea or something like this I'm not just going to sling a 50 count into this building until I have a reason to do that and it was a really short time until we are given a reason to do all of that and more whether it's 40 millimeter of our native launchers 50 cows laying 60 millimeter mortars on direct fire down avenues of approach it was every range you had ever been on all packed into one that was there and it was that way for a solid straight eight hours and nothing let up there wasn't a breather there wasn't anything it was in here the supply chains aren't going to come up to you because they know what's going on up there so at the times this is all happening the tanks are a pretty big signature all the sudden tanks run out of gas really quick when they're burning through that noise tanks start pulling out the bottle position because you can't get the fuel in to refuel the tanks are in the city tanks are now going to leave the city you and I just talked about the past hours I go my generation was very easy to go into a fight knowing that I was not going to be buried in some foreign dirt nation that was somewhere else in the world because the person on your left and right was going to make sure that wasn't going to happen just like when we went out there in the middle of burning amtrak and that street it was not an option to leave those Marines to have their bodies drug through streets or to have anything else like that not on my watch and to find out the gravity of this is overall these years that did happen in places and the iteration of the United States going out and having this honorable mission to go do that it's like I want to be a part of that how can I fit into the paradigm of doing this and that was about 2018 kicked off at that time period and then just offered up Mark Hale doing assessment of the organization and I just found out this passionate story of how many people what they were giving up to go and do this so if you want to go down in your stomach is when you see those bad boys start rolling the opposite way and you're left with thin skin vehicles because our amtrax on that deployment cycle we didn't have enough time when we got the deployment order jacco to get the bolt on armor to put on the outside of vehicles so our vehicles at the thickest point was two inches of aluminum we didn't have the applique we didn't have the enhanced armor it was in there and then the humvies still just had cloth doors and they had that that ghetto armor as we called it in 2004 and five and armor plates and all that were the product of what we learned back then to do that and as they're going the tanks go that way and now the fight is in a 360 and we're about an hour and a half into that don't know what's going on if the other northern bridge don't know what's going on on the outskirts of town where our third maneuver unit was supposed to be on the outskirts of town and that had the commander in the third maneuver unit on the outskirts of Nazarelia they kind of tried to do an end around with these command vehicles and they got into this Iraqi cesspool bog that was so you got up there you said February 18th got up there in February we offload in February and Kuwait and then we made the march up into the northern portion of Kuwait to stage where we're gonna go through the breech lanes into Iraq and then going in going into this how did the attitude compare to what you experience in the first Gulf War of of of your fellow Marines the attitude was absolutely there was no problem getting any Marines to do anything with the problem keeping them from doing something because they still had the twin towers burning in their head used to have people in your platoon that were in New York when that actually happened and it joined the Marines a couple of years later so they were kids that were 70 that was the catalyst to make them Marines and you have that fight of you did this and that that was the energy that was going in as we you know some of us who were here the first time knew that we were gonna be back there again because people had always chastised or whatever or armchair quarterback George Bush's decision on should he have just pushed the troops up into buying dad and knocked out Sonom and saying in 1991 and the mission was get him out of Kuwait put him back in the wrong house We were already in position and rolling and refueling we kicked off on about March 19th and started to track up because you're talking hundreds of miles that was in there and again fixing things along the way whatever you have to do because the thing was push push push push push push you can't stop you can't do this which really bonds to that old thing we were talking about like the USS Indianapolis you know it was maintain radio silence keep pushing keep pushing don't give away positions don't do whatever you have to do right get to the end of the result and but we started top and often refueling about the 21st it was kind of the invasion load for the fuel we've already loaded with ammunition you already loaded with everything the 22nd rolls into there and you instantly know the call is the 23rd is going to go into the city and then that's when you've already rehearsed at your position to take a certain bridge here's your mission and here's the time and date stamp that you have to be accomplished by whether it is set in office zero four in the morning to get to a bridge by zero late so that you have somebody that is here so did you but Talian get tasked to take nausea but you couldn't if you were a colored one there I couldn't do that so it's one of those things where you find a way and it might not be this year might be some year that was the way said absolutely sergeant made your game me a call he said show up down here in the pool deck about three fifteen in the morning bring your PT shorts bring your things down here getting a pool do some things run a PFT that was over here do a little bit of an interview brought some people down in and it's a tail end of the thing he said I'd just like to be a first sergeant here recon battalion tonight I'd absolutely love that job and he goes okay consider it done go back up I've already called your sergeant major up there before you even said yes you're coming back here went up to first battalion fourth Marine same thing back my stuff went down there and spent from the year of 2005 to 2010 as the first sergeant for company eight mostly absolutely but five times now went to Europe last year so last year in March we recovered a lost row called the missing road D of cemetery 33 that on tarawah is called the main marine cemetery now tarawah is only about 800 meters wide by about a click an half long it's not a very thing on island a base you know down there on every ounce of that is habitated now earth's huts there's everything else built on top of these and years ago the the cemeteries the marries did the best thing they could to bear in record the things and then they had to then go to the next time when to fight load up an anx ship to fight the thing like that turns it over airfield expansion starts going and then the cemeteries and that start moving around that island and then roughly in 1946 America has this big thing in the American grave registration unit and they're sent around the world to try to recover as many lost people in 1946 they can and they get this mandate they visit tarawah they get some bones and they bring it back they do that you did you feel like the Marine Corps the US military was in a state of basically you know what are really not going to have to fight another war I mean the whole world just saw what we did to these guys over here I know I had leadership that would straight up tell us that you know listen the days of you guys are never going to do a direct action mission it's just not going to happen and then on top of that we had technology and then you kind of find out for people that's on the podcast that are well you know what I've never been in the military or listen you find out it wasn't the military and a lot of times it taught these things it was here you find out when you when you look around at the goodness of your whole life and if you look at the context of your life line rather than the best years of your life was these years or these years if you look at their all building blocks on the entire time line of your life you find out that that teacher that wasn't in the military that taught you this is what you learned here that coach that was hard on you here that taught you here the mother that you thought was making dinner was actually married to a soldier for 26 years so even though that soldier's not here I might have picked up some of the leadership things from your old man so you might want to listen because maybe it looks like me doing it we don't need it this is what we do for the living so go to echelon front dot com and we'll look it up e f on line we're doing a lot of virtual stuff right now one of the things that we're doing virtual we we did we did online training before we're doing even more now I am live on that thing all the time if you want to talk to me if you want to come and ask me a question go to e f on line attend one of the online training live seminars we're talking one two three times a week I'm on there the rest of the team is on there you want to have you want to you got to talk to me let me know come and get it that's what we're doing e f on line dot com also have the master which is a live gig September 16th and 17th in Phoenix Arizona Dallas Texas December 3rd and 4th go to extremownership dot com if you want to come they've all sold out so you're going to sell out to we haven't even released the video but we still had the capabilities that nobody was for seeing the bus saw that was going to happen when when we crossed over those bridges that morning on the 23rd U.S. debriefing your your portunes like out in the field or you in the assembly area how is the word getting transmitted to the troops you're already doing the pre briefs that are out there in the days leading up to that once we got everything else is kind of on the move one time I've got six different radio nets that are going on inside of my helmet little box down here that I can switch between battalion tack one tack to fires anything else while you're still maintaining your communications for your inner comms for your vehicles you're still maintaining tactical control of your own people in relation to the battle that was on there and once the things are rolling there was no time to just stop and say we need to get everybody back together and talk about what we're about to do tomorrow and you know what I loved it I loved the messaging that it had that was on there because the messaging the politically incorrect messaging that should have came on then at the United States Navy we will completely destroy your way of life it's the same one to this and then things like listing the battle things of saying this is just one we have quite a few more of these and then more importantly is once again you don't pick it up out the machines you make it about the person and when people start seeing recruiting losers that actually have the resilience and the fighting thing I've seen America's army come out they're actually really good ones they got some door kicking things I mean they're actually targeting like we want infantry maple I also knew she needed to get over that hill for what we needed if we were going to have that and I also knew how much of a pride thing when you thought you'd never be able to achieve that because of all those excuses they were packing up for your own self you need to get over this hill and she got over there and she stayed with me for the rest of the time in the marine corps we would slap hands as I would come out of combat and she would go back into combat and the hardest job that I had was about 2007 when I had to stay back for seven months and play Mr. Mom to a 13-year-old daughter going through those daughter kind of things of boy you were a Tom boy about five months ago and we like to do this and now you got makeup now you have this at mom's not here to deal with this but I'm not telling you I go that other people were like that that you saw in training areas or you didn't see putting in the hours and the reps and the sets that it actually took to lay the maps and talk the history and and kind of really ingrained that mindset into somebody it was overall the Marines had the mindset subunit levels that were on there it always goes back to whatever the commander whatever the ownership is going to make it focus a training at that time period because you can have the higher authority the basic we're going to go in and we're going to do this mission but the people that you train each sleep breathe with that put that into you is normally not the chief and naval operations or the common on the Marine Corps it is your lieutenant colonel it is your captain and you know that thought that's like dang all that was going on at that like that's what you know because you say the dates and you're like I remember what I was doing 2003 I remember that what I was doing and you kind of flashed to man that's what he was doing at that time and you kind of make that little comparison and then we went about one of them started pointing about a hundred yards away interpreter comes up what's he saying he said we're missing a body is over there I'm like how does he know these are there probably because he was with him when that guy was killed walk behind another rock power hundred meters away dead and surge my end right over there because he was probably spotting or something with them these kids were 17 18 that was on that popped up in the ambulance pulled him off down the street you know international incident circumvented by kind of not desecrating or not doing what you're you know a lot of people may not even blame you got it animosity you're amped up you're doing this but I also looked up in out the cargo hatches in my plutones sergeant had the weapon station turned all the way to the back with the now's a net depressed end of the back of the neural and the other E7 that was in this hatch was leaning and riding the vehicle backwards with a baretta and was in Overwatch of me down there in other words they probably wasn't so scared to me because they were probably scared those crazy guys will fire into the back of your and kill even if the risk of killing one the run so we didn't have any problem pornal going into that training at mindset that we're going into their backyard this time with the greatest marines that we could put forward on the field of battle at that time and all the other cohesive forces going into there there there was not a mindset other than let's just get the show started did you think look I know and I'm you know you're out there walking these mountains and I'm thinking of myself that guy we're always going to have to have that guy we're always going to have to have that guy if anybody ever thinks that you don't need that soldier or marine that's going to mount up and go to wherever they get sent and take that mission and risk their lives and kill the enemy if you ever think that we don't need that guy and it just gave me great reassurance because he's out of the Marine Corps but he's out there and there's that's something we need to make sure that we always have and I think it's part of our instinct I think it's part of being an American but if we ever decide that maybe we need to dispel that attitude from our society we're heading down the wrong road in my opinion because the world the world's a nice place when you live in America but America's not the world and there's evil out there and there has to be people that have the attitude that when the call comes they'll go and they'll go and handle that problem. and it's one of those things it's just a great little ship from a great city that was out there I mean the USS Portland's that held that name before that these are ships that were in doies battle line and everything before and naming of these ships and these cities and when you were talking about do you think that people sometimes lost their way on what they were doing you know like the naming of naval ships and you look around the world and you see the publisher you see the invincible and you see different things that are out there one that built pride in your own ship that was here more importantly is when the anime kind of sees a floatella coming at them and they see the names of these ships that are actually coming that leads to a mindset of the people that are on that ship in a country behind that ship so when we're we're one we're sending the rules of Elts out are we're naming these cities and right down to these little LSTs that we're called barber counties and harland counties and these were produced to represent these Americans who were the fabric of our nation who are there and you know what to an extent you have to weigh where you need to put those forces now to where you need to put those forces somewhere in the future and at the same time maybe a fire down here on one of our LHAs and a few other things you just got taken offline when we've been running those ships ragged for about the past 20 years to in and out of dry docks and everything else puts us probably in one of the most vulnerable times again prior to 1941 we've been fighting for 20 years we've been recycling that equipment we've been throwing people into the breach 7 8 9 and 10 times we have sons and daughters that are now fighting the same war that their fathers and mothers went in the resilience of the American people is strong but it's going to be tested it's going to be tested very soon I was up in Montana a few weeks ago it's a shit dump it was a and an armored vehicle it looks like it's sand on top first one launches into there sinks all the way down it can't get out and one Abrams goes in after it it's gone command vehicles go in it's going and you're talking about now we're thermite engine compartments and everything because we're going to have to leave these vehicles inside of these cities this is the blueprint that wasn't supposed to happen or this is what how many hours into it are you right now this is two this is two end to that are you have you already taken casualties at this point at that point none in mining media area and then right after that is when I was faced in opposite direction fire an turret in kind of a rearward thing to keep the Iraqis back from this avenue of approach and we saw an ambulance coming into a high rate of speed up the thing and we were off the closest Somalia so we saw that happen so you maybe you'd get the feeling that maybe there would be some sort of what we what we used to call the big mission you know we get some one mission in fact a lot of our training was you know our full mission profiles oftentimes were around like hey this is a mission this is a mission there's the situation if you're going to do this mission you know when we worked with the Marine Corps it was always like and then we've been fighting never since in the major wars and also the small ones I believe our small war period started again roughly about the 2008 time period because if you actually look at that clock and I just now every 20 to 25 years this nation all has to mount up and go fight somebody everybody on a bigger scale to do that all the ways since 1775 and then in the next one of your period we have to reposition we have to rebuild and we have to spite these small little compressed areas around the things and prepare for the next one because history tells us the next one is eventually going to happen and if that's going to be an invasion of in-shan of which what you were saying is there a certain skill sense let's take the amphibious warriors that we have out there today you know they've been being told now that they'll never be another scale of D-day they'll never be another scale of this and I didn't go with a Lance Cooper to do selection assessment I didn't go through the things that those guys had to do I was a first-sorten it was happy to be in the infantry but that master gunnery sergeant I told you about in that recon platoon that was just sitting out on a bob doing nothing along with my machine gunners and that's how I found them went out of that city when we were running casualties and 14 miles away was the element of the mue headquarters out of a place called fob duke I rolled into post one all the way to the CP and when we set the casualties over to get treated at the main BDS I was there I always taught the Marines if you ever take a vehicle back to the rear you do not bring it back to the front empty ammunition food water whatever you have so the same guy that filmed the thing called Chris it was in there washes the blood out the vehicles he does the things he goes over the KBR representatives which were actually really great there was no 801 12 apples or anything else guy would unlock an entire ISO container and go you take what you want first and then just sign off the whole ISO container or whatever whatever they had to do but it wasn't you can't have this not fresh fruit or whatever you can do get it back in their trolls up I go over in the main CP and I get called up there because somebody finds out I just brought casualties back into your we're going to go back into the city and when we made that 14 thing with a shot out windscreen Chris who is not a home V driver or a license to on be driver and I mean that's right back to that mindset of Teddy Roosevelt the man in the arena today it's the man in woman in the arena because their lives are out there on the line to do that whether it's blue lives whether it's military lives or anybody else but to have that mindset we can never lose the mindset of fielding people who want to be in the arena how long did it take for you to get your for your battalion to know that you guys were going to spin up and and head over and 2003 we were on leave we got called I was putting a unit that we only had a few months to train up until that time period so we kept in the field last together we kind of went on leave and then you go across the bridges what was the first indication that oh it's on I the first indication it was on was even before we got that bridges because all of a sudden that morning we found out and started hearing calls that there was an army unit that had made its way into Nazarena and they had went up across one of the bridges that we were supposed to on the southern bridge made it across the northern bridge all the way what's now known as ambush alley US 507 maintenance was there and just managed to take a wrong turn Captain Troy King got the unit on the northern side they kind of figured out we're off the path up where we're at and figured at the time the best was to cut the shortest distance again to try to get back to where the convoy they had turned that they made that wrong turn so the greatest thing was when we first started hearing that we've got army vehicles on fire sitting in front here blood weapons laying all over the place and we are the north we're the spearhead the entire nobody's supposed to be in front of us so to hear over the radio what do you mean there's an army unit are they engaged or they not engage it's here well if you want to get any of these supplements then you can go to originmain.com you can go to the vitamin shop and you can pick this stuff up and it does actually support the podcast and it sports the podcast and you know what else it sports you know what else it sports sports America sports America's we're out there not only making supplements also making things for you too where where on your body so you may need to wear something during juttsu right while we're grappling we're not going we're not going Greek like the Greek naked wrestlers you see the pictures back these these statues back in the day we're not doing that we're not doing that So kind of on my mark, I'm going to run hug the wall this year and I'm going to get in and hopefully the guys going to shoot and miss the machine gunners are going to see where that came from and they're going to kill that sniper or fix that position in the building. and I they don't wear the uniform in the cloth and they're nation anymore it allows me to sit back at night and say that if they still follow the code they still build the same way and put them on the conveyor belt to do that they're going to spit out the best American fighting man and woman the world is still ever seen and don't anybody ever forget that it's not just guys jumping out of planes in 1944 or coming out of landing crap those news out there today are the most lethal things that you can put on the very battle field say a night state somebody wants to test the borders or somebody wants to poke us or try to do that you keep poking the bear it's on there you keep poking the bear just watch the eagle fly over take a dump on your head and when the eagle does that boom we bring a lot of things behind that as well um don't know what else more to say jacca that has been already said it said thank you it's been my pleasure today but this is the first stages of I'm bad and this is kind of an ambulance it's also with the same time kind of a v-bit it's coming this way because some of us did remember Bay Route a few things that were like that when we were younger um so it gets about 75 meters game on and we lit into that thing and that vehicle cleaned off and stopped and pounded into a wall the whole camp lit red that was on that and Susan smacked in that wall that back hatch opened up and six black clad Iraqi fed ahead fully armed with the teeth fighters came out of that back and that vehicle and started running across the street and there you know now it's I got another gonna use ambulance it's now they're gonna do this now you're really into this we'll take this carry out and then a yellow topping once if you ever do that again I will make sure that you're not going to be in the marines very long because he did the right he in the end the right thing is done in that chaotic situation that is there that's laid out before you you don't have hours you don't have things it's reactionary you're saving your losing lives to do that pretty beautiful thing and then how how to that lead to you get an attached to the recon unit the guy that I remember to do I got the guy I remember me getting him out of the tent and saying I need a provisional rifle put on to beef us up down there and the recon officer and the gunnery sergeant came up and said we'll do that job just get us into fight we roll them out made the request recon mounts up they end up being a provisional rifle put on and a recon put on attached to us and I said I'll give you an organizational assessment and he kind of said put what's that kind of cost me said nothing give me 30 days I'm going to fly it all the finding positions I'm going to get to know the people that's here everything I'll come back so I when I said jockel fuel one time I remember saying it and thinking oh I jockel fuels like seems like an individual product the way I said it so let me clarify jockel fuel is a collection of supplementation elements so this part we already know super cruel oil your cruel oil with some antioxidants in there joint warfare for your joint so you join to take a beating you know varying levels of beatings when you when you're working out you're doing different workouts you do too all that stuff you're you said that you thought hey we're going into there we're going into their territory now this is actually where they live we're probably going to see more resistance was that widespread or did a lot of people think hey man we you know we're probably looking two weeks at the most I still to this day can't remember seeing another armored column roll feet away through there because you're so focused on what you're doing in that area and now they're calling out RPG gunners they're calling out mortarmen on the top you're seeing the RPGs flip and hit in the road some of them are duds some of them aren't duds and then you'd have to disembark the infantry the infantry gets out there and this is like something that was I I could only imagine this is what custer felt like when you're got a 360 degree and it's coming from everywhere and you can't figure out what the main part of this whether it's artillery that's coming in on you whether it's forward observers there were people watching the battle and I go that we're just sitting up there drinking tea with their family on these varandas that are just watching and you're sitting here going is that a spotter is that somebody and they're hearing all this chaos going on their helmet and their listening still for the key words and the reaction to everything they're not going where's that coming from right they just start doing what they're trained to do that short amount of time move across that rail head nothing sitting move over the southern bridge and it was eerily quiet moving over the southern bridge of the uffredi's river was eerily like nothing was going on it's and we had everybody from the army they Air Force and everybody the one that I was very most interested in it wasn't the combat resiliency from us as marines because you're in the six foot fight with somebody or the teams that are going to go in and they're going to throw dogs and they're going to hit on target they're looking at watches we got this much time on the ground we have to get abnc tertiary targets primaries we got everything here and then it was just utterly amazing I went to a funeral and when I went to a funeral the first funeral was for funeral by an anime named Texard Carlson and he just happened to be the alpha company Patoonson for first Paty and second Marines a landing force from second assault amphibian baty and it was second amphibian tractor baty and which was my job on the 23rd of March of 2003 and that was the first individual it was identified when I was here so it was an amtraker they got to attend the amtraker of a guy who did his job on November 20th and lost his life on 1943 leading the first assault wave in the first LVT's that were ever used in offensive combat and then to be able to be a guy in 2003 that was part of task force tarawah that was named after those guys my wife I put her on the US as tarawah to go to war and she just looked and even before I met Mark Noah my license plate on my car as early as 2010 I got said tarawah across the back of the plate before I ever knew that this was what I was going to get into after I hung up this thing it's just amazing you'd said with that you said when earlier when you were getting at people were developing and utilizing modern-day technology as the basis of not having to send a man or a woman into a fight whether we're going to put AI and aircraft or they're going to do that I'm a armed believer I go that all of that is a battle enhancer that is not what you build the platform on the man and the woman is the platform that you invest in and you build you build the resiliency into them you build the determination the strength the warrior spirit the fight you put that into them and it doesn't matter if it's 20 years old I think it's even better when they hear that fire coming out of somebody that's 50 and 51 and everything else you throw them a coin you throw them a K bar something for some great work because it's a people business you build assets and comronery that way you don't build an adversarial nature by being the Marines issue up on the ship and they put everybody on water hours because the Marines take showers at a five minutes long or anything else you just kind of you know who's house you're in and you build that report because they're going to water too and they have a mission and you're really and their mission isn't just to drop you off they tie into a bigger mission they're kind of hoping in that comronery that they see you come back and to be looking at your naval brothers to go when you get push shore well anyways if you want some cool graphic art go to flipsidecampus dot com if you want a book if you want a book I got a bunch of books once called the code once called leadership strategy and tactics field manual once called way the warrior kid one two and three mickey in the dragons discipline who's freedom field manual and extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership a bunch of books talking about leadership reinforcing the ideas that I talk about here if you're an adult teaching those ideas to a young kid get after some of those also have a leadership consultancy called echelon front where we saw problems to leadership go to echelon front dot com for these guys if you want me to come and speak at your company or you want me to do a virtual meeting or you want someone on the echelon front team that you've heard on this podcast to get on a call with all your people and talk to them don't go to a speakers bureau don't do that go to echelon front dot com just the other the the speakers bureau's just a middleman and like I said thank you thank you for continuing to serve by working to bring these heroes home and truly living up to the words semper fiddellis thanks Justin thank you and with that Justin the Hugh has left the building awesome honor to be able to talk to him and another reminder that we all have more work to do more work to do to continue to be better stay on the path echo Charles what he got for us just stay on the path well we're gonna so to know that we're on the path that's a big one why before that before I go into that it's hearing like his story actually a lot of these stories or whatever yeah he said he said he said he get that little that he's got that little he's got a sweet tooth you know that kids choking down bockle vase you know that does make sense and it is good though in that way it's just not as tangier sour as I thought but within like a five minute conversation of anybody that tells you they didn't serve or they didn't have a connection to the military you can take almost anybody in this country whether you're an immigrant or a national or anything and within a five minute conversation you can expose to them that somewhere in their family line somebody had to fight they had the same blood inside of there whether it's a restaurant and little Italy right here whether it's coming over on the boat it doesn't matter they had to fight to get to that and then a lot of times they just didn't know it but a lot of those people had to do it in the uniform too and then all of a sudden the light comes on and then you find out they're like hey we're probably going to you know you're going to do one mission if you're lucky if you're lucky you're going to do one mission whether it's a special reconnaissance of one thing or some kind of a direct action on a ship or a hostage situation and that was and we started this operation I've been doing for about two years and to great relationship a great group of individuals that are military civilians scientists world-renowned archaeologists EOD experts military medics you name it as the repertoire to do that they're just passionate Americans that are going and researching over 78,000 missing cases that are still left out there trying to get at some closure to fulfill America's promise of we don't leave our dead wounded when we know where we're at we're going to go and get you we may not be able to get you at the time to fight that's actually happening but dead or alive you're coming home The resistance that they were going to meet, they were expecting 40,000 casualties in the first 24 to 48 hours, which is, I guess, right in line with 82% and I was of course thinking, well, I'm going to get, you know, in my freaking whatever 18 year old idiot mind, I'm thinking, okay, maybe I won't miss this because they're going to need. I think they actually were very fearful when they kind of knew the major thing is to now take this guy out and we're going to do it in such a manner and such a speed that was out here that we're sitting there with these vehicles they're left over from the end of Vietnam when they were brand new going we're going to push him across the desert sometimes at night sometimes when they'll maps sometimes broken down and they have to leave that one back with a crew to fix it and you found in all these travels you've got military civilian PhDs, hunters, Republicans, Democrats, Blacks, White's Puerto Ricans, it's this organization that you win today's day in age with all this polarity can come together like this to perform this mission to fill the void of 76 years and provide closure and bring that back to reinforce that promise the dead are alive we're gonna find you and we're gonna come back and have a collective unit like that those were units like I see to pride in your eyes when you talk about the team you've name it that was doing this and then here for a while you know we've got it's not a job it's an adventure we have this we have this and all the sudden you start the troops start talking it's kind of like what is our identity right now and my the Pepsi generation am I the join the Navy see the world generation am I that you know the Marines are the Semperfidelis we didn't promise you a damn rose garden type generation and I believe they're totally prepared now because this was years ago at the impancy of when we're going to have enlisted drone pilots we're going to start flying drones out of these cans out of places in the United States to where these people show up to work in the morning get a debrief on a thing do a battle handover and then fly on some missions and predators and that that at the end of the day somebody puts a board up like they didn't Vietnam and go well we had five today walks out there I think these it's been an honor and privilege really a professional pleasure to spend this time today with with you and echo discussing what isn't what may be common to some people just isn't common to everybody that is out there and your podcasts and the impact that those podcasts do have the amount of people from all different walks of life that kind of tune in to this platform and this voice that is out there in this time right now especially in the trying time that we have now it's these reinforcing principles that we're talking you know you and I and echo and it was kind of like that comment that Chester Puller made and it's not like, well good, we know we know we're that, you know they have us surrounded okay good pass incur a moment of weakness you want to invoke jocco to help you not yell at you or nothing like this help you just listen to one of those tracks the appropriate track for that particular weakness moment boom he'll help you right across the bridge super easy to 100% effective rate by the way I'm not going also if you want to have a visual kind of reminder the visual help go to flipsidecampus dot com to code a Meyer American made graphic art there I said it On September 11th I was I was at Camp Lijoon and we were doing a non-commissioned officer of the quarterboard that morning and we were outside and somebody in ran outside and just said you never can't believe this some jackass just kind of flew a plane in the world trades center like and everybody thought it was like a sess now or something that was here it was true it was no news every just kind of went about their way and that's kind of weird and I drove the M track down into the side set the driver over near the tank that tanks main guns are engaging T62s in the field everything this is getting real main gun over pressure blasting you can't get a hold of them their mission fix that's here got on the ground, climbed up the side of the tank got on the back of the gunner staying and grabbed the gunner's helmet off the top which I believe kind of startled him a little bit because they are actively engaging troops that are in the field and started to ask him I mean he he looked and was like well do you come from I said did you see some soldiers are up there and I've listened to that through these podcasts from whether it's from kids and children there is always something here because it really reinforces what we have been discussing about today and it doesn't have to be this traumatic fallerous or a grievous incident that's in your life that defines that's who your life is now you performed in those incidences because of the conglomeration of who you were in the Constitution that made it up at that period and it allows you to overcome those incidences just like overcoming COVID just like overcoming a car crash just like overcoming anything else in life I believe this provides resiliency and tools for people they may not identify with podcast number 176 they may not identify not even identify ever with a whole podcast but there's something that somebody can take out of each little one of those in a appliance of their own life I believe in the context of overall it builds a better person no I didn't take your name your name isn't jocco is it so jocco unraveling right now we're releasing on this feed soon it'll be on a separate feed we got the grounded podcast we got the warrior kid podcast we got warrior kid soap from irish oaks ranch dot com where you can get soap so that you can for the love of god you can stay clean uh YouTube you want to tell them about YouTube just I know you're quite going into that and we're like about the same thing on this side they ain't wearing a uniform donation but to service that they chose to perform for the nation in a crappy fourth world infested little I wonder in the middle it doesn't look like to eat eatier or feed you or anything else like that like god matinee or what are supposed to be man it's just a awesome awesome and it said flying be part of the search and recovery afterwards to try to locate missing men and bring them back home their families didn't know how you're going to do that didn't know what you're going to do
