00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.46
This is jockel podcast number 301 with echo Charles and me jockel wink good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:12.24
How did I end up here?

3
00:00:13.64 --> 00:00:15.64
I'm smart

4
00:00:15.96 --> 00:00:20.16
I'm funny. I look pretty damn handsome if I do say so myself

5
00:00:21.28 --> 00:00:23.28
But here I am

6
00:00:24.16 --> 00:00:26.16
nowhere

7
00:00:26.16 --> 00:00:30.16
And it seems this is where I will always be

8
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:34.16
nowhere

9
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:37.52
Bedroom

10
00:00:37.52 --> 00:00:39.68
It is not an apartment, but it looks like one

11
00:00:40.60 --> 00:00:45.40
cheap furniture will used carpet not clean but not dirty

12
00:00:46.36 --> 00:00:52.12
The bedroom is not unique in its wares bed desk chair dresser

13
00:00:52.12 --> 00:00:56.52
Small bedside table with lamp over headlight

14
00:00:57.24 --> 00:01:00.04
Janky ceiling fan spinning at a low speed

15
00:01:01.72 --> 00:01:03.72
Then there is the day core

16
00:01:04.60 --> 00:01:06.92
Pictures hung neatly on the walls

17
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:10.04
They are strange

18
00:01:10.36 --> 00:01:14.28
Or at least indicate a strangeness that is hard to interpret

19
00:01:15.64 --> 00:01:17.64
harmless but different

20
00:01:17.64 --> 00:01:21.64
Johnny walks in

21
00:01:22.52 --> 00:01:25.24
20 something leaning towards 20

22
00:01:26.68 --> 00:01:34.12
Pretty damn handsome from unkempt young man who stays up to late and eats the wrong foods and drinks more beer and whiskey than he should

23
00:01:36.36 --> 00:01:38.36
He looks at his brother

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Johnny is frustrated

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.84
He tries to remain restrained but it can be hard after all these years

26
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:51.24
What the hell cleaner man? I told you about these shirts

27
00:01:52.68 --> 00:01:54.68
Arty looks distraught

28
00:01:55.56 --> 00:01:57.56
Johnny sees

29
00:01:57.56 --> 00:01:59.56
Johnny cannot stay frustrated

30
00:02:01.16 --> 00:02:02.52
After all

31
00:02:02.52 --> 00:02:04.52
This is Arty his brother

32
00:02:06.04 --> 00:02:08.28
And no one could really be mad at Arty

33
00:02:08.28 --> 00:02:10.28
What?

34
00:02:10.28 --> 00:02:12.28
Is it not clean? Arty replies

35
00:02:12.28 --> 00:02:14.28
Honestly concerned

36
00:02:14.28 --> 00:02:16.28
Wondering if he had somehow failed his brother

37
00:02:17.32 --> 00:02:18.28
No Arty

38
00:02:18.28 --> 00:02:20.28
It isn't that it is not clean

39
00:02:20.28 --> 00:02:22.28
It's clean

40
00:02:22.28 --> 00:02:24.28
But it's just a t-shirt

41
00:02:24.28 --> 00:02:26.28
I know

42
00:02:26.28 --> 00:02:28.28
Arty cuts in

43
00:02:28.28 --> 00:02:30.28
It's 100% cotton t-shirt

44
00:02:30.28 --> 00:02:32.28
I used a warm warm cycle

45
00:02:32.28 --> 00:02:34.28
It shouldn't have shrunk at all

46
00:02:34.28 --> 00:02:36.28
I'm always careful about that

47
00:02:36.28 --> 00:02:38.28
The wrong Arty that's not it

48
00:02:38.28 --> 00:02:40.28
It's just

49
00:02:40.28 --> 00:02:42.28
Never mind

50
00:02:42.28 --> 00:02:44.28
Forget it

51
00:02:44.28 --> 00:02:46.28
What's wrong

52
00:02:46.28 --> 00:02:48.28
This was killing Arty

53
00:02:48.28 --> 00:02:50.28
The one thing he was supposed to be good at

54
00:02:50.28 --> 00:02:52.28
And it seemed like he messed it up

55
00:02:54.28 --> 00:02:55.28
Arty

56
00:02:55.28 --> 00:02:56.28
Johnny replied

57
00:02:56.28 --> 00:02:58.28
As kindly as he could

58
00:02:58.28 --> 00:03:00.28
It's just that it's a t-shirt

59
00:03:00.28 --> 00:03:02.28
You don't press t-shirts

60
00:03:02.28 --> 00:03:04.28
You don't put starch in t-shirts

61
00:03:04.28 --> 00:03:04.28
Buddy

62
00:03:04.28 --> 00:03:06.28
But the creases are sharp

63
00:03:06.28 --> 00:03:08.28
Aren't they?

64
00:03:08.28 --> 00:03:08.28
Arty replies

65
00:03:08.28 --> 00:03:10.28
Wondering what on earth

66
00:03:10.28 --> 00:03:12.28
The problem could be

67
00:03:12.28 --> 00:03:14.28
The creases are sharp

68
00:03:14.28 --> 00:03:16.28
Johnny concedes

69
00:03:16.28 --> 00:03:18.28
But that's not the point

70
00:03:18.28 --> 00:03:20.28
You don't put military creases in t-shirts

71
00:03:20.28 --> 00:03:22.28
I've told you this before

72
00:03:22.28 --> 00:03:22.28
Arty

73
00:03:22.28 --> 00:03:24.28
But why?

74
00:03:24.28 --> 00:03:26.28
Cotton holds the starch really

75
00:03:26.28 --> 00:03:28.28
Well

76
00:03:28.28 --> 00:03:30.28
Johnny starts to get frustrated again

77
00:03:30.28 --> 00:03:32.28
He's been down this road before

78
00:03:32.28 --> 00:03:34.28
Many times

79
00:03:34.28 --> 00:03:36.28
Look cleaner

80
00:03:36.28 --> 00:03:38.28
I know that you always tell me that

81
00:03:38.28 --> 00:03:40.28
And I always tell you

82
00:03:40.28 --> 00:03:42.28
You just don't start your press t-shirts

83
00:03:42.28 --> 00:03:44.28
Because

84
00:03:44.28 --> 00:03:46.28
You just don't do it

85
00:03:46.28 --> 00:03:48.28
Mom likes hers

86
00:03:48.28 --> 00:03:50.28
Pressed

87
00:03:50.28 --> 00:03:52.28
Johnny lets out a sigh

88
00:03:52.28 --> 00:03:54.28
Arty realizes he's gone too far

89
00:03:54.28 --> 00:03:56.28
Listen, Arty, I get it

90
00:03:56.28 --> 00:03:58.28
But I'm not mom

91
00:03:58.28 --> 00:04:00.28
And I don't want my t-shirts

92
00:04:00.28 --> 00:04:02.28
I'm not a star, it's a black Sabbath t-shirt

93
00:04:02.28 --> 00:04:04.28
I just wear it out with a pair of jeans

94
00:04:04.28 --> 00:04:06.28
Okay, can you just give me

95
00:04:06.28 --> 00:04:08.28
Give them a simple, wash and dry

96
00:04:08.28 --> 00:04:10.28
From now on, please

97
00:04:10.28 --> 00:04:12.28
Low heat tumble dry

98
00:04:12.28 --> 00:04:13.28
Arty asks

99
00:04:13.28 --> 00:04:14.28
Wanting to get a good procedure

100
00:04:14.28 --> 00:04:16.28
Lockdown

101
00:04:16.28 --> 00:04:18.28
Johnny smiles

102
00:04:18.28 --> 00:04:20.28
Yeah, Arty

103
00:04:20.28 --> 00:04:22.28
I think that would be perfect

104
00:04:22.28 --> 00:04:23.28
Thanks bud

105
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:24.28
I can do it now

106
00:04:24.28 --> 00:04:26.28
Arty offers

107
00:04:26.28 --> 00:04:28.28
I gotta go

108
00:04:28.28 --> 00:04:30.28
Okay, it won't happen again Johnny

109
00:04:30.28 --> 00:04:32.28
Thanks Arty

110
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:34.28
Johnny said with a smile

111
00:04:34.28 --> 00:04:36.28
And Johnny?

112
00:04:36.28 --> 00:04:37.28
Arty asks

113
00:04:37.28 --> 00:04:38.28
What?

114
00:04:38.28 --> 00:04:40.28
I'm sorry

115
00:04:40.28 --> 00:04:42.28
It's okay bud

116
00:04:42.28 --> 00:04:44.28
It's okay

117
00:04:44.28 --> 00:04:46.28
Johnny feels a little bad as Arty walks away

118
00:04:46.28 --> 00:04:48.28
They are brothers

119
00:04:48.28 --> 00:04:50.28
They even look a little like

120
00:04:50.28 --> 00:04:54.28
It isn't too much of a stretch to see the similar jeans

121
00:04:54.28 --> 00:04:56.28
Dark hair

122
00:04:56.28 --> 00:04:57.28
Blue eyes

123
00:04:57.28 --> 00:04:59.28
Pernounced eyebrows

124
00:04:59.28 --> 00:05:03.28
But that is where the similarities end

125
00:05:03.28 --> 00:05:07.28
After all, Arty is different

126
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:11.28
A little pludgy

127
00:05:11.28 --> 00:05:13.28
Glasses

128
00:05:13.28 --> 00:05:15.28
It is possible to tell from looking at his face

129
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:17.28
That something isn't quite right

130
00:05:17.28 --> 00:05:21.28
There are medical names that could be assigned

131
00:05:21.28 --> 00:05:25.28
But most of those wouldn't quite hit the mark

132
00:05:25.28 --> 00:05:29.28
He's older than Johnny by six years

133
00:05:29.28 --> 00:05:33.28
But his peculiarities keep him living at home

134
00:05:33.28 --> 00:05:38.28
Johnny on the other hand doesn't have an excuse to still be living at home

135
00:05:38.28 --> 00:05:41.28
Other than Arty and his mom

136
00:05:41.28 --> 00:05:45.28
They both need him around

137
00:05:45.28 --> 00:05:47.28
That's where he tells himself anyway

138
00:05:47.28 --> 00:05:52.28
Johnny's bedroom is the same room he has always had

139
00:05:52.28 --> 00:05:57.28
Matches on the floor, no box spring, no bed frame

140
00:05:57.28 --> 00:06:01.28
Postures of rock bands on the wall from when he was younger

141
00:06:01.28 --> 00:06:04.28
Black Sabbath, motor head

142
00:06:04.28 --> 00:06:07.28
Led Zeppelin, ACDC

143
00:06:07.28 --> 00:06:09.28
Some muscle cars too

144
00:06:09.28 --> 00:06:14.28
He hadn't bothered to take them down as he outgrew them

145
00:06:14.28 --> 00:06:18.28
He also hadn't bothered to clean his room very often

146
00:06:18.28 --> 00:06:23.28
Close remnants of food and beer cans on the floor

147
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:26.28
This was all a stark contrast to Arty's room

148
00:06:26.28 --> 00:06:31.28
Critically clean with the bed tightly made

149
00:06:31.28 --> 00:06:36.28
And then there are the walls of Arty's room in their curious day core

150
00:06:36.28 --> 00:06:42.28
The walls neatly display pictures of clothes, washing machines and dryers

151
00:06:42.28 --> 00:06:47.28
There are brochures about various lines of laundry equipment on his little desk

152
00:06:47.28 --> 00:06:51.28
Some of the more colorful ones are also hanging on the wall

153
00:06:51.28 --> 00:06:55.28
There are also coupons for laundry detergents, fabric softens

154
00:06:55.28 --> 00:07:00.28
And stain removal products on the desk in an envelope

155
00:07:00.28 --> 00:07:04.28
The source of his nickname, Cleaner

156
00:07:04.28 --> 00:07:06.28
Is no mystery at all

157
00:07:06.28 --> 00:07:09.28
Arty likes to clean

158
00:07:09.28 --> 00:07:11.28
Laundry

159
00:07:11.28 --> 00:07:13.28
To be exact

160
00:07:13.28 --> 00:07:20.28
That right there is the opening

161
00:07:20.28 --> 00:07:23.28
To a new book

162
00:07:23.28 --> 00:07:26.28
A new book called Final Spin

163
00:07:26.28 --> 00:07:31.28
Which was written by me

164
00:07:31.28 --> 00:07:35.28
And it is a novel

165
00:07:35.28 --> 00:07:37.28
I guess that's what it says in the cover

166
00:07:37.28 --> 00:07:39.28
But it's also kind of a poem

167
00:07:39.28 --> 00:07:44.28
It's also kind of a manuscript I don't really know 100%

168
00:07:44.28 --> 00:07:49.28
What to call it but it's not normal in the way that it is written

169
00:07:49.28 --> 00:07:55.28
And so as far as the storyline goes

170
00:07:55.28 --> 00:07:58.28
It's, I was thinking about this

171
00:07:58.28 --> 00:08:04.28
I think it's a little bit of an alternate autobiography of source of your very alternate history books

172
00:08:04.28 --> 00:08:08.28
So it's where they take some event in the past and they change it

173
00:08:08.28 --> 00:08:10.28
What if the Nazis won?

174
00:08:10.28 --> 00:08:12.28
What if the south won the civil war?

175
00:08:12.28 --> 00:08:15.28
They call them alternate history books

176
00:08:15.28 --> 00:08:19.28
So it's kind of thinking this is almost like an alternate biography in a way

177
00:08:19.28 --> 00:08:22.28
Maybe not specifically but maybe some of my friends

178
00:08:22.28 --> 00:08:24.28
Some of the experiences we had

179
00:08:24.28 --> 00:08:27.28
Maybe my life if I'd taken some different turns along the way

180
00:08:27.28 --> 00:08:30.28
Well I didn't know this guy's name is Johnny

181
00:08:30.28 --> 00:08:32.28
The guy's name is Johnny

182
00:08:32.28 --> 00:08:35.28
Yeah but then there's like you're going to see as we talk through this

183
00:08:35.28 --> 00:08:39.28
I'm composite characters and it's almost like everyone's a composite character

184
00:08:39.28 --> 00:08:40.28
What do you mean composite?

185
00:08:40.28 --> 00:08:43.28
Meaning different people from my past kind of

186
00:08:43.28 --> 00:08:45.28
A symbol together

187
00:08:45.28 --> 00:08:47.28
Maybe two people that acted a certain way

188
00:08:47.28 --> 00:08:49.28
Well one characteristic from someone

189
00:08:49.28 --> 00:08:51.28
Maybe a little bit of a characteristic from me

190
00:08:51.28 --> 00:08:56.28
So that was kind of the starting point

191
00:08:56.28 --> 00:09:00.28
These kind of humans and you put them in this situation

192
00:09:00.28 --> 00:09:02.28
So what does the book about?

193
00:09:02.28 --> 00:09:04.28
Let me, I'm going to start off by reading a review of the book

194
00:09:04.28 --> 00:09:06.28
The first review to come out about the book

195
00:09:06.28 --> 00:09:09.28
And this review came from

196
00:09:09.28 --> 00:09:12.28
Something called Publishers Weekly

197
00:09:12.28 --> 00:09:17.28
Which is a publishing trade magazine that's been around since 1872

198
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:23.28
And the subtitle of this thing is the international news magazine of book publishing in book selling

199
00:09:23.28 --> 00:09:27.28
This is the heavy hitter of this industry

200
00:09:27.28 --> 00:09:30.28
Since the 1940s the book review section

201
00:09:30.28 --> 00:09:35.28
Is sort of become the center of the magazine in the online website

202
00:09:35.28 --> 00:09:37.28
And it carries a lot of weight

203
00:09:37.28 --> 00:09:42.28
And truly ultimately determines a lot of what you read

204
00:09:42.28 --> 00:09:47.28
Depending on how it does and how this publication talks about it

205
00:09:47.28 --> 00:09:51.28
What's interesting is the reviews in publishers weekly are anonymous

206
00:09:51.28 --> 00:09:53.28
They're short

207
00:09:53.28 --> 00:09:55.28
They're blunt

208
00:09:55.28 --> 00:09:58.28
And oftentimes to the point of being brutal

209
00:09:58.28 --> 00:10:00.28
You can see that the people that write them

210
00:10:00.28 --> 00:10:04.28
Can be harsh and very usually crafty writers

211
00:10:04.28 --> 00:10:07.28
So they're harsh in a pretty savage way

212
00:10:07.28 --> 00:10:09.28
I was reading a little bit about it one author said

213
00:10:09.28 --> 00:10:12.28
A negative review is never pleasant

214
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:17.28
But publishers weekly reviews have a particularly heart-stopping quality

215
00:10:17.28 --> 00:10:19.28
And this guy wrote a piece

216
00:10:19.28 --> 00:10:22.28
I didn't write down his name but it was how he got a bad review

217
00:10:22.28 --> 00:10:24.28
And just what it felt like

218
00:10:24.28 --> 00:10:31.28
Now as I said this book is different

219
00:10:31.28 --> 00:10:33.28
It's not a normal book

220
00:10:33.28 --> 00:10:36.28
It's hard to classify the form that I wrote it in

221
00:10:36.28 --> 00:10:39.28
And I've written a bunch of other books before

222
00:10:39.28 --> 00:10:42.28
Some best selling books in New York Times best selling books

223
00:10:42.28 --> 00:10:46.28
But here's the thing those books were of a different genre

224
00:10:46.28 --> 00:10:47.28
Right

225
00:10:47.28 --> 00:10:50.28
And that means a lot in this world

226
00:10:50.28 --> 00:10:55.28
In the publishing world and the literature world

227
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:59.28
I've written a bunch of these non-fiction adult books

228
00:10:59.28 --> 00:11:00.28
That's what I've written

229
00:11:00.28 --> 00:11:02.28
And I've written children's fiction books

230
00:11:02.28 --> 00:11:06.28
Right but neither of those are fiction adult books

231
00:11:06.28 --> 00:11:09.28
So it's like saying I played professional football

232
00:11:09.28 --> 00:11:11.28
So I can play professional baseball too

233
00:11:11.28 --> 00:11:13.28
It's sort of like saying that

234
00:11:13.28 --> 00:11:14.28
Which we know

235
00:11:14.28 --> 00:11:16.28
Doesn't really work that way

236
00:11:16.28 --> 00:11:20.28
And most people can't handle that transition

237
00:11:20.28 --> 00:11:22.28
And don't handle that transition

238
00:11:22.28 --> 00:11:25.28
So going into this going into writing the novel

239
00:11:25.28 --> 00:11:27.28
Right I got warned

240
00:11:27.28 --> 00:11:28.28
I've ever talked about this?

241
00:11:28.28 --> 00:11:29.28
Probably

242
00:11:29.28 --> 00:11:32.28
I got warned by my publisher

243
00:11:32.28 --> 00:11:34.28
By my I got warned by my editor

244
00:11:34.28 --> 00:11:36.28
I got warned by my agent

245
00:11:36.28 --> 00:11:38.28
They were

246
00:11:38.28 --> 00:11:40.28
They were I think

247
00:11:40.28 --> 00:11:42.28
Little bit trying to talk me out of it

248
00:11:42.28 --> 00:11:44.28
Little bit trying to talk me out of it

249
00:11:44.28 --> 00:11:46.28
They're saying it's a different world

250
00:11:46.28 --> 00:11:48.28
And they don't care what you've done before

251
00:11:48.28 --> 00:11:51.28
And they might they might actually hold your other books against you

252
00:11:51.28 --> 00:11:53.28
They kind of say that kind of

253
00:11:53.28 --> 00:11:54.28
Right

254
00:11:54.28 --> 00:11:56.28
And you should just maybe stay in your lane

255
00:11:56.28 --> 00:11:59.28
Which by the way I got that about my kids books too

256
00:11:59.28 --> 00:12:01.28
But

257
00:12:01.28 --> 00:12:03.28
This story

258
00:12:03.28 --> 00:12:05.28
Is one of the stories that's in my head

259
00:12:05.28 --> 00:12:06.28
And I got a lot of stories in my head

260
00:12:06.28 --> 00:12:09.28
And this was the one that bubbled the surface that needed to get out

261
00:12:09.28 --> 00:12:10.28
So I got it out

262
00:12:10.28 --> 00:12:12.28
And this is what publishers weekly had to say

263
00:12:12.28 --> 00:12:14.28
So here we go

264
00:12:14.28 --> 00:12:16.28
From the critics

265
00:12:16.28 --> 00:12:18.28

Marks is adult fiction debut

269
00:12:25.28 --> 00:12:29.28
With the downbeat and gripping story of a group of characters

270
00:12:29.28 --> 00:12:31.28
Abandoned by the American Dream

271
00:12:31.28 --> 00:12:33.28
At age 23

272
00:12:33.28 --> 00:12:35.28
Johnny cares for his alcoholic mother

273
00:12:35.28 --> 00:12:37.28
And mentally challenged brother Arty

274
00:12:37.28 --> 00:12:40.28
While holding down a dead end job as a stockboy

275
00:12:40.28 --> 00:12:43.28
At a big box store

276
00:12:43.28 --> 00:12:46.28
Arty is obsessed with clean clothes

277
00:12:46.28 --> 00:12:50.28
And when the laundromat where he works is slated to be sold

278
00:12:50.28 --> 00:12:55.28
Johnny decides to buy the business in order to keep Arty employed

279
00:12:55.28 --> 00:12:59.28
To come up with the $40,000 he needs

280
00:12:59.28 --> 00:13:01.28
Johnny and his best friend go

281
00:13:01.28 --> 00:13:04.28
Decide to rob the safe at their store

282
00:13:04.28 --> 00:13:06.28
Hand off the money to the owner

283
00:13:06.28 --> 00:13:08.28
Then high tail at Tomexica

284
00:13:08.28 --> 00:13:10.28
They get the money

285
00:13:10.28 --> 00:13:13.28
But the getaway scheme is flawed from the start

286
00:13:13.28 --> 00:13:15.28
And Johnny and Goat quickly

287
00:13:15.28 --> 00:13:18.28
Have the state police on their trail

288
00:13:18.28 --> 00:13:19.28
To make matters worse

289
00:13:19.28 --> 00:13:23.28
Johnny is forced to say goodbye to his girlfriend Jessica

290
00:13:23.28 --> 00:13:26.28
Who has just found out she is pregnant

291
00:13:26.28 --> 00:13:31.28
Willing tells his story in quick blasts of high coup like writing

292
00:13:31.28 --> 00:13:33.28
And they give the example here

293
00:13:33.28 --> 00:13:36.28
Johnny on the customers at his workplace

294
00:13:36.28 --> 00:13:38.28
They call people

295
00:13:38.28 --> 00:13:42.28
Flesh covered robot beings in need of fuel and meaning

296
00:13:42.28 --> 00:13:46.28
They find both here and quote

297
00:13:46.28 --> 00:13:50.28
With dialogue reminiscent of early David Mehmet

298
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:53.28
Told with a gritty simplicity

299
00:13:53.28 --> 00:13:59.28
This retains a hold on the reader right through to the inevitable tragic climax

300
00:13:59.28 --> 00:14:04.28
So that's the plot of the book

301
00:14:04.28 --> 00:14:08.28
And that's the impression that they got at publishers weekly

302
00:14:08.28 --> 00:14:12.28
Which was really an awesome review

303
00:14:12.28 --> 00:14:15.28
I was definitely very stoked to read that

304
00:14:15.28 --> 00:14:19.28
As was my literary age and as was my publisher as was my editor

305
00:14:19.28 --> 00:14:21.28
Everyone thinks you're all in the dice

306
00:14:21.28 --> 00:14:22.28
Everyone's nervous

307
00:14:22.28 --> 00:14:23.28
They're scared

308
00:14:23.28 --> 00:14:25.28
Yeah, you kind of are rolling the dice

309
00:14:25.28 --> 00:14:28.28
But the nature of dice is you win and you lose

310
00:14:28.28 --> 00:14:32.28
Yeah, you know a lot of times what people worried about is the losing part

311
00:14:32.28 --> 00:14:34.28
Yeah, but there is the winning part

312
00:14:34.28 --> 00:14:36.28
Yeah, now so they compare me they compare the

313
00:14:36.28 --> 00:14:38.28
The

314
00:14:38.28 --> 00:14:44.28
Writing or at least the dialogue to yeah the dialogue and I want to give myself too much credit here

315
00:14:44.28 --> 00:14:48.28
But they compare the dialogue to David Mehmet Mehmet

316
00:14:48.28 --> 00:14:50.28
Who is

317
00:14:50.28 --> 00:14:54.28
Well straight up he's a Pulitzer Prize winning freaking author

318
00:14:54.28 --> 00:15:00.28
He's a playwright he's a film director director screenwriter he's written all kinds of stuff

319
00:15:00.28 --> 00:15:07.28
You've heard a Glenn Gary Glenn Ross. Yes, sir. Yep. He wrote that. Yeah, coffees for clothes

320
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:12.28
Always be closing speed the plow he wrote the screenplay for the postman

321
00:15:12.28 --> 00:15:14.28
Always ring twice

322
00:15:14.28 --> 00:15:16.28
Little Jack Nicholson

323
00:15:16.28 --> 00:15:20.28
The verdict the untouchable's hoffa wag the dog Hannibal

324
00:15:20.28 --> 00:15:26.28
He wrote and directed things changed homicide Olianna the wins low boy

325
00:15:26.28 --> 00:15:31.88
Staten main Spartan just a bunch of stuff what I'm saying is that this guy's a highly respected and a

326
00:15:31.88 --> 00:15:33.88
Completter definitely I was

327
00:15:34.28 --> 00:15:39.96
Very pleasantly surprised and humbled to be compared to him in any way, so we were off to a strong start

328
00:15:39.96 --> 00:15:42.44
We're feeling good about it so far. Much appreciated

329
00:15:43.48 --> 00:15:45.48
Because this is a different world

330
00:15:46.04 --> 00:15:48.04
So

331
00:15:48.04 --> 00:15:50.04
It's interesting

332
00:15:50.04 --> 00:15:54.36
appreciate yeah people if you if you want to get the book that will be awesome

333
00:15:54.36 --> 00:15:59.16
And it's not a complete dud. We'll say that

334
00:16:00.36 --> 00:16:04.20
So now this is an interesting we're gonna get into the book a little bit

335
00:16:06.36 --> 00:16:11.80
Which is gonna be a little bit tricky because I don't want our ruin the story story spoiler spoiler alert

336
00:16:11.80 --> 00:16:13.80
So I'm gonna keep it

337
00:16:14.36 --> 00:16:21.32
A little bit focused on not going too much into it, but at the same time getting into the characters a little bit so

338
00:16:21.32 --> 00:16:23.32
The characters

339
00:16:24.12 --> 00:16:26.12
Let's start with this guy, Arty

340
00:16:26.36 --> 00:16:28.36
So we got this guy Arty who

341
00:16:29.56 --> 00:16:37.24
You already heard about he's got some kind of mental challenges which I don't name in the book and the reason I didn't name him in the book is because

342
00:16:38.44 --> 00:16:43.80
A lot of times I've met people in my life where I know that they have some kind of mental challenge, but

343
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:50.52
I don't know what it is. I'm not a doctor. There's no they're not wearing a label on their

344
00:16:51.48 --> 00:16:54.68
hat that says whatever mental challenge they've got

345
00:16:56.20 --> 00:17:00.60
And so I didn't want a label you know I didn't want to throw a label on there. This is the particular

346
00:17:01.24 --> 00:17:07.48
Situation that this person's in and the other thing is I you know people have such a wide variety of mental challenges that

347
00:17:08.60 --> 00:17:10.60
You don't know what you're gonna get

348
00:17:10.60 --> 00:17:12.60
So

349
00:17:12.60 --> 00:17:18.68
Where did this character came from? Well, this is a very direct story. I worked at Wendy's

350
00:17:20.36 --> 00:17:24.36
Yeah, I don't know if that I don't know if that weren't the hell yeah, but I worked at Wendy's

351
00:17:25.32 --> 00:17:31.96
And when I worked at Wendy's you've been Wendy's before right, which let's face it kind of props to Wendy's Wendy's

352
00:17:33.08 --> 00:17:39.16
Wendy's when he serves it up and I used to I used to get my child on at Wendy's when I was a teenager

353
00:17:39.16 --> 00:17:43.24
Well, at this Wendy's when I worked there was there was a salad bar you know they have a salad bar at Wendy's

354
00:17:43.24 --> 00:17:47.88
I don't know they still have salad bar Wendy's not that I know of oh, I don't know so back in the day

355
00:17:49.40 --> 00:17:53.56
Back in the day they had a salad bar at Wendy's and the person that ran the salad bar

356
00:17:54.36 --> 00:17:57.000
That took care of the salad bar that we supplied the

357
00:17:57.64 --> 00:18:04.76
Peach slices and the Caesar salad dressing was this woman who clearly had she was probably

358
00:18:04.76 --> 00:18:10.60
I'm gonna say 55 maybe 60 years old so older woman thin

359
00:18:11.88 --> 00:18:13.88
Short hair her name was a gene and

360
00:18:15.40 --> 00:18:21.24
She obviously had you know so it seemed like some kind of perhaps autism

361
00:18:22.28 --> 00:18:24.68
But again, I don't know. She's not wearing a label

362
00:18:25.80 --> 00:18:29.24
But she was super into the salad bar

363
00:18:29.24 --> 00:18:35.96
She was probably the best one of the best employees ever she loved this salad bar. She wanted to be squared away

364
00:18:35.96 --> 00:18:40.92
She was out there with a washcloth wiping up if anybody if you spilled a drop of salad dressing on your

365
00:18:41.56 --> 00:18:43.56
on your maneuver from the

366
00:18:44.12 --> 00:18:48.20
Spoon to the plate she was honest she was standing by with a rag

367
00:18:48.20 --> 00:18:52.44
She was gonna wipe that up like almost bumping into you, but she also knew that that wasn't correct

368
00:18:52.44 --> 00:18:58.36
She'd give you you know three quarters of a second to take one step towards the croutons and she was in there

369
00:18:58.36 --> 00:19:00.36
Getting on it

370
00:19:01.08 --> 00:19:07.40
So she's there and she's working and she loved it. I mean like she was obsessed with it and no one would talk to her

371
00:19:07.40 --> 00:19:12.28
Right everyone was kind of mean to her right because you could make fun of her and she was an easy target

372
00:19:12.68 --> 00:19:15.96
And I was cool to you know, I'd always say hi, hi, Jean

373
00:19:15.96 --> 00:19:19.32
I know you know trying to talk to her a little bit and every time I would start a conversation with her

374
00:19:19.64 --> 00:19:24.68
Hey, Jean how are you you know, hey, Jean how's it going today and she'd be like I just opened up a new can of of

375
00:19:24.68 --> 00:19:29.000
Of of Coutons in the bar new a new can of sliced peaches. They're gonna be so good

376
00:19:29.56 --> 00:19:31.08
I'd be awesome

377
00:19:31.08 --> 00:19:34.76
You know and I'd say oh, you know, it's here like lunch break

378
00:19:35.56 --> 00:19:39.72
Hey Jean are you gonna take a lunch break? Yeah, but first I'm gonna get more sliced onions out here and

379
00:19:40.60 --> 00:19:44.20
Have you seen the onions there so fresh she just fired up

380
00:19:46.20 --> 00:19:48.20
to the point where

381
00:19:49.24 --> 00:19:51.24
I was torn

382
00:19:51.64 --> 00:19:52.84
between

383
00:19:52.84 --> 00:19:54.20
thinking

384
00:19:54.20 --> 00:19:56.20
if it was

385
00:19:56.20 --> 00:19:59.48
Unabusive situation where she was being taken advantage of

386
00:20:00.36 --> 00:20:01.88
to where

387
00:20:01.88 --> 00:20:04.84
The others like complete opposite was she just

388
00:20:05.96 --> 00:20:12.04
What are they so well she's so lucky to be there and happy that they hired her and like here she was with this job

389
00:20:13.96 --> 00:20:19.24
So that was one part of it the other part of it that struck me that stuck with me for my whole life

390
00:20:19.24 --> 00:20:22.92
Is that she was

391
00:20:24.36 --> 00:20:30.12
Happy right so here I am this young freaking punk ass kid and I'm there with other

392
00:20:30.44 --> 00:20:34.52
Punk ass kids that are working at Wendy's and everyone's kind of miserable

393
00:20:35.16 --> 00:20:40.84
Right, did you ever work at a fast food joint? Do you ever work at a restaurant? I did not work at a restaurant

394
00:20:40.84 --> 00:20:45.08
The bar nightclub's closest but even being a bouncer in a bar nightclub is not

395
00:20:45.08 --> 00:20:51.56
That's let's face it that's like a little bit kind of cool. Yeah a little bit right you have a little

396
00:20:51.56 --> 00:20:57.000
Pows also a bar back it one point at other clubs and get tender so it's it's service

397
00:20:57.72 --> 00:21:00.92
It's different you're good. It's different it's a little bit cool

398
00:21:01.48 --> 00:21:03.88
Yes, to be a bouncer at a club. Yes, sir, right

399
00:21:04.68 --> 00:21:07.24
I mean that can be a definitely a cool job

400
00:21:07.96 --> 00:21:10.60
It's not cool to work at Wendy's

401
00:21:10.60 --> 00:21:16.68
Run in the grill running the salvage bar. You're not happy about it. There's no benefits

402
00:21:17.32 --> 00:21:21.16
Zero you know you other than you're getting paid money, which is kind of cool

403
00:21:21.88 --> 00:21:28.68
So what struck me what I was remembered is we're all kind of miserable even if this is what I also remember like the the general manager

404
00:21:29.48 --> 00:21:31.48
And I forget to remember his name

405
00:21:31.48 --> 00:21:35.96
But he was like work he was one of those guys. It was just a work working, you know working

406
00:21:35.96 --> 00:21:41.96
Just always pissed off about something like hey, what you know always mad so even the own I mean he was I don't

407
00:21:41.96 --> 00:21:44.60
He's the owner around the because the owner, but he's definitely the general manager

408
00:21:45.08 --> 00:21:48.52
He might have even been the franchise owner or something but he's using there all the time

409
00:21:49.40 --> 00:21:51.08
But you know he had to be making

410
00:21:51.08 --> 00:21:55.80
Legitum at money because when you when you're a general manager one of those you're making good money, but he was freaking miserable

411
00:21:56.28 --> 00:21:59.64
Something to myself everyone here is miss every single person here

412
00:22:00.84 --> 00:22:03.32
100 I mean the how many employees that they probably have

413
00:22:03.32 --> 00:22:09.08
Probably a total of 35 to 40 employees, you know day shift night shift

414
00:22:09.64 --> 00:22:11.64
You know everyone

415
00:22:11.96 --> 00:22:17.32
Everyone's part time, you know, so no one's really working so there's like probably 40 employees there total

416
00:22:18.12 --> 00:22:21.72
And every single one of us was miserable and

417
00:22:22.76 --> 00:22:24.60
Hated life

418
00:22:24.60 --> 00:22:28.04
Except for Jean and she was smiling and she was into it and she was amped

419
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.36
so

420
00:22:30.36 --> 00:22:32.36
I took that idea

421
00:22:32.36 --> 00:22:34.36
and

422
00:22:34.92 --> 00:22:42.12
The reason I ended up with laundry is because I worked at or the where place where I used to go to the laundry mat in San Diego

423
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.80
Had this the people at own the laundry mat

424
00:22:46.36 --> 00:22:48.76
the the they were from Asia and

425
00:22:49.96 --> 00:22:55.96
The wife didn't speak English, but the husband would be kind of be there, but the the the wife didn't speak English

426
00:22:55.96 --> 00:22:57.96
But she'd come out and talk to me

427
00:22:57.96 --> 00:23:04.28
In I don't even know where she was from but she would talk to me and smile and laugh and make jokes

428
00:23:05.16 --> 00:23:08.12
Not in English, not in English, but they were funny

429
00:23:09.32 --> 00:23:10.12
I mean I

430
00:23:10.12 --> 00:23:15.40
They were so funny that I did laugh I would laugh. I would do my wife. I would laugh and whatnot even know what it was about

431
00:23:15.72 --> 00:23:18.92
You know she might point it like you know a pile of clothes and say something

432
00:23:20.12 --> 00:23:24.20
In whatever language you were so I could do it didn't just start laughing if my wife were just laugh

433
00:23:24.20 --> 00:23:28.12
It had to be pretty funny for her to get that but joy on it, right?

434
00:23:29.72 --> 00:23:32.68
So I don't know that I landed on laundry

435
00:23:34.68 --> 00:23:41.08
So there we go there we get already that kind of wraps up this guy already as a character where he came from so now we get this other character Johnny

436
00:23:42.68 --> 00:23:45.08
Which as you said, yeah, it's my guess my

437
00:23:45.88 --> 00:23:52.28
My real first name is John so do we get the Johnny from that kind of but I don't know I maybe just the generic of

438
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:58.44
Of the name Johnny more than anything else, but but probably the strongest

439
00:23:59.80 --> 00:24:07.80
Influence on this character is a kid that I grew up with a kid named Jeff Lang who I've talked about on this on the spotcast before

440
00:24:08.12 --> 00:24:10.36
So Jeff Lang was like my best friend

441
00:24:11.64 --> 00:24:13.64
From maybe

442
00:24:14.36 --> 00:24:16.36
Third grade

443
00:24:16.36 --> 00:24:19.88
Maybe second no probably second second first or second grade

444
00:24:19.88 --> 00:24:21.88
until

445
00:24:21.88 --> 00:24:23.88
seventh grade and

446
00:24:23.88 --> 00:24:28.44
in fifth grade when we we were in the same classroom together all day

447
00:24:29.72 --> 00:24:32.04
Because that's before you start going to different classes, right?

448
00:24:32.04 --> 00:24:36.28
So fifth grade we were in the same class, you know sitting next to each other and we were we were

449
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.04
Trouble makers right just always getting in trouble always causing problems always you know laughing when we shouldn't be laughing

450
00:24:44.04 --> 00:24:46.04
Just doing stuff that we shouldn't have been doing

451
00:24:46.04 --> 00:24:48.92
But he was always a little bit more

452
00:24:50.04 --> 00:24:54.76
He had a little bit he had a little bit less obedience in him. I didn't have much

453
00:24:55.72 --> 00:25:01.32
He had even less obedience in him so like at that point when the teacher would

454
00:25:02.84 --> 00:25:05.72
Threaten or you you'd be quieter you're going to the office

455
00:25:06.28 --> 00:25:08.76
That was he could I got checked by that

456
00:25:09.40 --> 00:25:13.40
Jeff wouldn't get checked by that he connects level gets sent to the office, right?

457
00:25:13.40 --> 00:25:16.12
So he had a little bit extra and he was super funny

458
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.44
I mean hilarious, you know kind of an athletic stud

459
00:25:21.64 --> 00:25:27.88
Which what does that mean that means when you're in fifth grade you kind of kick acid dodge ball right click kick ball and he's really good in run

460
00:25:27.88 --> 00:25:32.52
So yeah, just fast and all that stuff just a good at really good athlete better than me

461
00:25:33.32 --> 00:25:35.32
funnier than me

462
00:25:35.88 --> 00:25:37.88
Tall you know just just a good

463
00:25:37.88 --> 00:25:44.76
He was just kind of like a little bit better than me and everything and he also had a little bit of extra rebelliousness

464
00:25:46.52 --> 00:25:48.52
So

465
00:25:48.60 --> 00:25:50.60
As we got older

466
00:25:51.48 --> 00:25:56.60
I started kind of we we started started to deviate in our lives together

467
00:25:57.72 --> 00:26:01.72
You know we were we were still always friends but he started like

468
00:26:01.72 --> 00:26:07.96
Drinking started doing drugs started listening to I guess he went down like the kind of

469
00:26:09.80 --> 00:26:19.08
hippie music drugs that kind of thing and I was going into the hardcore music and more like the straight edge thing and so our paths really kind of deviate it

470
00:26:20.52 --> 00:26:26.20
But we were still friends because we were such good friends for so long that it doesn't matter what he's doing and what I'm doing

471
00:26:26.20 --> 00:26:34.60
We're still friends we just have this you know huge common connection and as we got so so as we got older

472
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:40.04
He went really you know, I don't even know if he I don't even remember if he graduated high school

473
00:26:41.08 --> 00:26:47.08
Because he went hard you know doing drugs and drinking and just doing that whole thing

474
00:26:48.20 --> 00:26:53.72
And not not a bad person that's just what he was doing and still I'd see him see him in town

475
00:26:53.72 --> 00:27:01.48
We you know we'd always connect we'd always just had that friendship and I remember I joined the military during the Navy

476
00:27:02.20 --> 00:27:04.68
And you know small town and he kind of knew

477
00:27:05.96 --> 00:27:07.96
He'd heard what was going on and then I saw

478
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:12.12
And I remember he said something to me

479
00:27:12.52 --> 00:27:17.32
Because you know when we were little kids we would play army all the time right when you're look when you're

480
00:27:17.96 --> 00:27:22.68
Seven years old ten years old 12 years old and you live in the woods you're playing army

481
00:27:22.68 --> 00:27:28.04
Right you're putting your burn in a cork and putting make your face black and put in camo on and

482
00:27:28.84 --> 00:27:32.20
Shoot and be guns at each other. That's what we did. We put you be be guns at each other and

483
00:27:32.92 --> 00:27:36.04
Every time you got hit you had to take a layer of clothing off

484
00:27:37.88 --> 00:27:41.88
And I remember the red rider it makes a little boom when it it's like

485
00:27:43.88 --> 00:27:48.68
This it's spring active. Oh yeah, and because you know we try and put limits on the number of pumps

486
00:27:48.68 --> 00:27:53.72
You could put on the pump backs right and but I remember the red rider because you you could hear it boom

487
00:27:53.72 --> 00:27:55.72
And then you hit you

488
00:27:57.80 --> 00:28:03.32
So so you know he was into the same kind of stuff. I was and then as we got older we deviated

489
00:28:04.20 --> 00:28:09.16
So I see him the last time I see him before I leave for the Navy

490
00:28:10.28 --> 00:28:12.28
he's

491
00:28:12.28 --> 00:28:13.96
You know clearly

492
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:15.96
Not on a great path

493
00:28:15.96 --> 00:28:19.08
And he said something to me along the lines of

494
00:28:22.28 --> 00:28:24.52
He said yeah, you're doing the Navy I said yeah

495
00:28:25.72 --> 00:28:30.36
And I'm even remember if we if he knew what a seal was I think he kind of did

496
00:28:31.24 --> 00:28:34.36
The only I kind of did it that time you know new too much about it

497
00:28:35.08 --> 00:28:40.84
But he's I'm gonna reset something like hey, I wish I could go with you and I was like you can't bro, let's go

498
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:43.24
And I could see like maybe that could

499
00:28:43.24 --> 00:28:47.08
And he said I can't he's I can't I can't

500
00:28:48.12 --> 00:28:52.04
Something like I can't anymore like he had knew he was kind of too far gone

501
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:54.92
To correct the path that he was on

502
00:28:56.44 --> 00:29:02.36
So I end up going the Navy and I was going through seal training and I was

503
00:29:03.32 --> 00:29:05.32
Probably around

504
00:29:05.32 --> 00:29:12.12
Just before hell week maybe just after a week I forget but I called my parents to check in I talked to my mom

505
00:29:12.12 --> 00:29:20.52
And I found out that Jeff had killed himself and he had he had broken up with his girlfriend at the time and he'd killed himself

506
00:29:22.60 --> 00:29:25.40
And that was you know just just a

507
00:29:27.08 --> 00:29:29.08
Very sad

508
00:29:29.08 --> 00:29:35.08
Because well, I think what made it the most sad to me was that he had gone down this path

509
00:29:37.08 --> 00:29:41.16
And he had way more potential than I had as a human and and

510
00:29:41.16 --> 00:29:43.16
It was all gone

511
00:29:43.88 --> 00:29:48.76
And that was really sad and then when when I looked him up, you know, this is when the last time I recorded

512
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.96
I talked about him on this podcast for a couple of years ago

513
00:29:51.96 --> 00:29:57.48
I had googled him just googled his name which you can google people from you know

514
00:29:57.72 --> 00:29:59.72
1745 and there's some

515
00:30:00.68 --> 00:30:02.68
record and there's some

516
00:30:02.68 --> 00:30:13.08
Genealogy report about who they were and you google someone from 1942 and there's you know an obituary about who they were and I googled his name and

517
00:30:13.80 --> 00:30:15.80
There was like nothing

518
00:30:16.36 --> 00:30:18.36
nothing

519
00:30:20.60 --> 00:30:22.36
Which is just

520
00:30:22.36 --> 00:30:25.56
Carb because he was freaking hilarious smart

521
00:30:26.68 --> 00:30:28.68
on a just an awesome guy

522
00:30:28.68 --> 00:30:35.64
And and quite I didn't mention this but the book you know the dedication of the book is just says for Jeff Lang

523
00:30:39.88 --> 00:30:42.12
So that was sort of

524
00:30:43.40 --> 00:30:49.64
A lot of where this character Johnny came from somebody with kind of potential and

525
00:30:51.32 --> 00:30:53.32
Just

526
00:30:53.32 --> 00:30:56.92
Stuck made bad choices

527
00:30:58.28 --> 00:31:02.12
Maybe not bad choices but different choices maybe had some bad luck thrown in there

528
00:31:03.88 --> 00:31:05.88
Live this life

529
00:31:06.60 --> 00:31:08.60
So that's Johnny you hear about these too

530
00:31:12.44 --> 00:31:17.16
Next up you get a guy named goat who's Johnny's best friend. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to

531
00:31:17.16 --> 00:31:24.04
page 7 here in the book

532
00:31:27.32 --> 00:31:33.000
Nice shirt man goat says with a smile as he sees Johnny's starched black Sabbath T-shirt

533
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.12
It's military creases running from each shoulder down to the waist up yours Johnny replies

534
00:31:38.60 --> 00:31:45.000
That cotton really holds the crease doesn't it yeah does Johnny says you couldn't iron them out or anything

535
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.40
I tried but damn he uses an industrial press and he looks at me like I'm ripping his heart out what can I say

536
00:31:51.72 --> 00:31:53.72
My brother is crazy

537
00:31:53.72 --> 00:31:59.08
Yeah, but that son of a bitch can iron some shirts can he he sure is hell can you want another one

538
00:32:00.12 --> 00:32:02.12
What time do we have to be at work go to ask

539
00:32:03.32 --> 00:32:08.76
Not until 10 30 shit. Let's do this two more Lucy Johnny says to the bar made

540
00:32:10.12 --> 00:32:12.12
BB's bar

541
00:32:12.12 --> 00:32:17.80
Dingy working class watering hole cheap final seats even cheaper drinks

542
00:32:19.56 --> 00:32:23.32
Go is about the same age as Johnny though he looks a little younger

543
00:32:24.12 --> 00:32:31.08
His dark skin has an almost childlike texture his black hair looks as if it is always organized

544
00:32:31.56 --> 00:32:33.40
Regardless of what he has been doing

545
00:32:34.36 --> 00:32:36.36
His eyes are dark and deep

546
00:32:36.60 --> 00:32:38.60
He is handsome

547
00:32:38.60 --> 00:32:42.12
He too has that look about him that says he shouldn't be here

548
00:32:43.48 --> 00:32:45.32
Shouldn't be in a dead end job

549
00:32:45.56 --> 00:32:47.16
shouldn't be in a dead end bar

550
00:32:48.04 --> 00:32:50.04
shouldn't be in a dead end life

551
00:32:51.72 --> 00:32:53.72
But he is

552
00:32:58.12 --> 00:33:00.12
So there's go

553
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:02.68
Full name George Martinez

554
00:33:03.72 --> 00:33:06.76
That is Johnny's best friend and again

555
00:33:06.76 --> 00:33:10.60
This guy is kind of a composite character of

556
00:33:11.88 --> 00:33:16.76
Friends that I had grown up the story takes place in southern California

557
00:33:19.80 --> 00:33:23.56
So he's a Mexican kid. I grew up with a bunch of white people primarily

558
00:33:24.36 --> 00:33:31.72
But when you're out in California you see the there's really no distinction between you know different people

559
00:33:31.72 --> 00:33:33.72
um

560
00:33:35.56 --> 00:33:43.96
And that's just another kid another kid that has a bunch of potential another kid that's talented another kid that's smart another kid that's handsome

561
00:33:45.56 --> 00:33:51.88
And another kid that's kind of stuck in a dead end sense scenario with what I said dead end job dead and bar dead in life right

562
00:33:53.40 --> 00:33:55.40
That's where we end up

563
00:33:56.04 --> 00:33:58.04
That's where we're at

564
00:33:58.04 --> 00:34:00.04
And

565
00:34:00.52 --> 00:34:01.72
And

566
00:34:01.72 --> 00:34:04.52
Well, we were talking before the podcast about the young

567
00:34:06.44 --> 00:34:13.88
I think I think carry was saying you remember what it was like when you were younger and it was just all in kind of like you're just on board

568
00:34:13.88 --> 00:34:19.64
Right down for the call it's right down for the cause and that was

569
00:34:20.60 --> 00:34:27.48
The characteristic that I kind of tried to throw in here with goat was that characteristic of being down for the cause and what's cool

570
00:34:27.48 --> 00:34:30.76
What when you when you talked about Johnny being based on me

571
00:34:32.84 --> 00:34:40.28
There's parts definitely elements of me in Johnny for sure, but one of the elements that's that's from me in goat is just down for the cause

572
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:42.44
I've been to stuff that you do in your

573
00:34:42.92 --> 00:34:50.60
16 17 18 and then when I got in the Navy your 19 20 years old guess what oh that's what as you like to say echo

574
00:34:50.60 --> 00:34:51.96
That's what we're doing

575
00:34:51.96 --> 00:34:53.96
Yep down for the cause. We're down

576
00:34:53.96 --> 00:35:00.44
We're ready to go well with that is that what we're doing hey all right once you kind of flip that switch

577
00:35:01.16 --> 00:35:04.12
That's why man the young the young men in the world

578
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
They'll do some crazy shit

579
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.36
Sometimes because they're just reddit rock and roll

580
00:35:11.48 --> 00:35:15.80
Ready to rock and roll so there's you two main characters and again

581
00:35:16.28 --> 00:35:18.76
One of the things one of the immediate feedback points

582
00:35:19.80 --> 00:35:21.80
When I submitted the manuscript

583
00:35:21.80 --> 00:35:23.80
And

584
00:35:23.80 --> 00:35:25.80
Was how about some more character development

585
00:35:25.80 --> 00:35:28.92
Right and what I said is you already know these characters

586
00:35:29.16 --> 00:35:33.24
We already know these characters. We grew up with these characters everybody knows these people

587
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:35.96
Everybody knows these people we all know them

588
00:35:36.52 --> 00:35:38.52
We are them in many ways

589
00:35:39.16 --> 00:35:41.88
So I was like what what what what what also I need to tell you

590
00:35:42.76 --> 00:35:46.28
What else do I need to tell you you know these people I know these people

591
00:35:46.84 --> 00:35:49.24
There's your character development look around

592
00:35:49.24 --> 00:35:51.24
You

593
00:35:51.24 --> 00:35:51.24
You

594
00:35:51.24 --> 00:35:53.24
Started this with Arty

595
00:35:53.24 --> 00:35:56.04
Mm-hmm, and that's one of the first things that jumped out of me

596
00:35:56.28 --> 00:36:02.92
Or it's like not only do I know who that guy is I've known a guy or girl like that since I was a little kid

597
00:36:03.16 --> 00:36:08.68
And it's just he's just there. He's down for his cause some negative some positive some or like

598
00:36:09.16 --> 00:36:15.40
Angry at everyone somewhere. It's just happy to see every you know like but but really in it not it kind of in a generic

599
00:36:15.40 --> 00:36:20.20
Almost kind of way. I mean it's more particular because because of the book and everything right but you know that guy

600
00:36:20.60 --> 00:36:26.84
Totally know that guy that's the first thing that you're telling me for Arty already. Oh, yeah, and how many Arty's have you known about?

601
00:36:27.48 --> 00:36:28.20
12

602
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:32.60
Yeah, but they fit that in one way or another little different flavor

603
00:36:32.60 --> 00:36:40.84
Yeah, yeah, sure, you know, oh man. I could go deep into it too where some people would tease them just like your girl Jean same exact thing

604
00:36:40.84 --> 00:36:44.20
And they're everywhere so it's like yeah, you know we all know Arty

605
00:36:44.20 --> 00:36:50.12
I think we all know Arty we all know Jean we all know Johnny well know goat

606
00:36:50.84 --> 00:36:56.28
These are our people and there's the character development yeah, and look obviously there's more character

607
00:36:56.28 --> 00:36:58.44
Velpon that's goes on but you know

608
00:36:59.08 --> 00:37:04.44
For me to take the time to explain this this is one thing you're you're gonna notice when you read this book is

609
00:37:04.92 --> 00:37:08.92
I'm not I'm trying not to waste any time. Yeah. I'm trying not to waste any words

610
00:37:08.92 --> 00:37:18.28
It I'm trying to get you there it get you there get you into this as quick as possible and allow you to

611
00:37:18.84 --> 00:37:25.08
To utilize what you already know as a person yeah to to put the context around what's happening

612
00:37:25.48 --> 00:37:30.36
Use the schema. I was reading this book and they went deep in the word schema. Yeah

613
00:37:30.36 --> 00:37:38.84
That's like you stuff that you already know to describe something new right interesting and you use like

614
00:37:39.72 --> 00:37:46.68
You do this in real life too where you use less words than necessary kind of thing and it's weird because it makes you kind of go like

615
00:37:46.68 --> 00:37:51.56
Deep in your own head almost when you're like even that one when you're describing you know

616
00:37:52.44 --> 00:37:56.92
People you know me however be described in the news just like it's like

617
00:37:56.92 --> 00:38:02.84
You didn't do this like the opposite of the the opposite of that is like some grandiose thing where it's like

618
00:38:02.84 --> 00:38:08.44
You know one after another the people piled in like this and like that and then this person and it's

619
00:38:08.44 --> 00:38:13.08
But note you did the exact opposite but meanwhile you get the same effect but it's more like in your own

620
00:38:13.72 --> 00:38:18.84
And like real personal kind of you know there's something I talk about with leadership. It's

621
00:38:19.40 --> 00:38:24.44
Minimum force required right I as a leader want to use the minimum force

622
00:38:24.44 --> 00:38:31.72
To get you to do what I want you to do yeah to get you to do what we need to do right minimum force required

623
00:38:31.72 --> 00:38:36.20
I don't want to say hack or here's what you need to do I might say hack or what you think about doing this and you're like

624
00:38:36.20 --> 00:38:39.56
Oh, yeah, that's probably be good right I want to use the minimum force

625
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.36
I try and write I try to write this book where the the feeling is there with the minimum amount of words

626
00:38:48.92 --> 00:38:50.92
Get the point across with the minimum amount of words

627
00:38:50.92 --> 00:38:54.28
It does add drama to it

628
00:38:55.48 --> 00:38:57.96
That because even in real life this book aside

629
00:38:59.24 --> 00:39:04.92
Like it's more dramatic that way well I also say all the time the less you talk to more people listen

630
00:39:04.92 --> 00:39:11.88
Yeah, I give that as leadership counsel hey if you're in there and you got something to say in a meeting and you say it in

631
00:39:12.28 --> 00:39:14.92
14 sentences and it takes you seven minutes

632
00:39:14.92 --> 00:39:19.64
Yeah, maybe 14 second maybe maybe maybe it takes you seven minutes to say something

633
00:39:21.80 --> 00:39:23.56
That you could have said in

634
00:39:23.72 --> 00:39:31.08
14 seconds the 14 second route was way is way preferred of course and it's gonna have so much more impact

635
00:39:31.08 --> 00:39:36.28
Yes, but let's face it the added specifically added drama

636
00:39:36.84 --> 00:39:43.000
Is undeniable like so if if we're here. I don't know let's say we had to I don't know make key chains or something and

637
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.04
There was like a hundred thousand key chains that needed to be made and we get here five p.m. whatever and I ask you

638
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
And you're like yeah, we need to get these done or whatever and then I look at them and go hey, are we gonna do all these tonight and and

639
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.32
There's two different scenarios where you could be like you know what yeah, we're gonna we're gonna get all these done tonight or you could just look at me

640
00:40:05.16 --> 00:40:09.32
I know are the answers fucking yes, yeah, oh, it's hell. He has much way much dramatic

641
00:40:09.32 --> 00:40:16.68
Yeah, you don't even say anything say anything right or you could pull which would you typically do you'll just say yes and that's it

642
00:40:17.24 --> 00:40:22.84
I want more I want you to make me feel good. I want to but it's just this big black hole of

643
00:40:23.64 --> 00:40:29.16
Nothingness that I'm just left with except for yes like with that you you got to make of it

644
00:40:29.16 --> 00:40:33.000
Whatever you're gonna make of it, but yes, you know, so it's like how we merge back

645
00:40:34.36 --> 00:40:36.84
Good so that's what the book is written like

646
00:40:36.84 --> 00:40:38.84
Um

647
00:40:38.84 --> 00:40:45.24
I we're gonna roll into don't just trying to give some of the characters right some of the some of the characters here's the

648
00:40:46.76 --> 00:40:52.52
I guess this is our leading female character in the book here we go

649
00:40:54.28 --> 00:40:56.28
She is a pretty but tough looking girl

650
00:40:57.40 --> 00:41:04.04
thick black hair that wants to curl but is for the most part stringed by its own weight and volume

651
00:41:04.04 --> 00:41:11.32
pale skin dark eyes eyes with a hint of fight left in them

652
00:41:12.68 --> 00:41:14.68
But most of the fight is gone

653
00:41:16.04 --> 00:41:21.80
Born away by long hours and hard work and worn away by the reality of life

654
00:41:24.92 --> 00:41:26.92
Jessica

655
00:41:26.92 --> 00:41:33.64
Where have you been she asks working where else Johnny responds defensively you can't call or anything

656
00:41:34.36 --> 00:41:38.12
Sorry he replies. I'm a prick. Yeah, you are she says

657
00:41:39.56 --> 00:41:44.44
You never held that against me before don't start now you buy me a drink and I'll forgive you Lucy

658
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.20
So-co and coke Johnny shouts to the bar made so-co and coke got it the bartender response

659
00:41:51.08 --> 00:41:53.08
How's work Johnny asks

660
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:55.08
although he knows the answer

661
00:41:55.08 --> 00:42:01.32
The usual marks an asshole everybody comes into that place is a fucking asshole and I do what I do

662
00:42:02.12 --> 00:42:05.24
Smiling kiss their ass. Why don't you quit Johnny asks?

663
00:42:05.96 --> 00:42:09.48
It's an earnest question even though the answer is known by him

664
00:42:10.84 --> 00:42:17.000
She knows the answer to she also has the same question why don't you quit your fucking job stock boy

665
00:42:18.12 --> 00:42:19.16
Ouch

666
00:42:19.16 --> 00:42:21.56
Thanks Johnny mutters ejected

667
00:42:21.56 --> 00:42:26.36
Well, I mean fuck of course I'd quit that job same as you but who's gonna pay the rent?

668
00:42:27.24 --> 00:42:31.48
The bartender approaches them and places the Southern comforting coke in front of Jessica

669
00:42:31.96 --> 00:42:35.000
So-co and coke she says matter of fact thanks Lucy

670
00:42:35.56 --> 00:42:39.000
Johnny tells her thanks Johnny Jessica says to Johnny

671
00:42:39.88 --> 00:42:42.20
Anything for you darling he says with a smile

672
00:42:42.92 --> 00:42:49.32
Great your horny she says hey he replies defensively. I'm just don't worry

673
00:42:49.32 --> 00:42:51.32
I am too she says with a smile

674
00:42:55.96 --> 00:42:57.96
So there's Jessica

675
00:42:59.64 --> 00:43:03.000
Again, where does Jessica come from kind of a composite character of

676
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Growing up of traveling

677
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.48
If we've gone in different towns different cities

678
00:43:10.60 --> 00:43:13.000
Restaurants bars, you know, she's a waitress

679
00:43:13.80 --> 00:43:18.68
I know many Jessica's in my time and like you said

680
00:43:18.68 --> 00:43:23.24
I think we've all known plenty of Jessica's and and look she's hard working

681
00:43:24.04 --> 00:43:26.04
She's determined what she's up against the odds

682
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:34.52
And she's also productive and you learn this in the book she's a product of some bad decisions or at least some decisions that aren't great ones

683
00:43:34.68 --> 00:43:37.80
Right so she kind of ends up in her

684
00:43:38.60 --> 00:43:43.40
stuck in this position as well and and to quote Harvey Kytel

685
00:43:43.40 --> 00:43:50.04
From reservoir dogs. Yes, her waitressing is the number one job for female non college graduates in this country

686
00:43:52.76 --> 00:43:56.76
And I always I always you know because I worked in restaurants man

687
00:43:57.32 --> 00:44:00.36
That's a freaking hard job and you got a smile

688
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.68
Right, yeah kind of customer service. It's got a smile

689
00:44:05.24 --> 00:44:09.88
So not only are you working a hard job and people are treating you bad in some cases

690
00:44:09.88 --> 00:44:13.40
Yeah, where this is in cook good enough

691
00:44:13.80 --> 00:44:17.64
By the way if you if you ever are serving me and I return something to kitchen

692
00:44:17.64 --> 00:44:21.88
It is totally jacked up because if it's not a totally jacked up. I'm just gonna like just like it

693
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:27.48
I mean you got to give me a raw bleeding piece of meat if you think I'm gonna return to the kitchen

694
00:44:28.20 --> 00:44:32.68
What about the wrong thing so you can use you straight up the wrong thing they mess your order up wrong thing is it

695
00:44:32.68 --> 00:44:34.68
Some mum down with

696
00:44:34.68 --> 00:44:39.24
You know like is it okay isn't like hey, I ordered the rib eye get a piece of primer

697
00:44:39.24 --> 00:44:41.24
Go I'll eat it. What if you get a fish

698
00:44:41.96 --> 00:44:43.96
Probably going back

699
00:44:43.96 --> 00:44:48.20
I'll be cool about it. Yeah, I'll probably just say you know what I might do in that situation. This is how nice

700
00:44:48.76 --> 00:44:49.96
I am like it

701
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:54.68
Nice to say yeah, no because I'd probably be like hey, you know, I'm also interested in getting a steak and you bring your rib eye

702
00:44:54.84 --> 00:44:56.84
You get both of my things

703
00:44:56.84 --> 00:45:01.88
Yeah, maybe maybe put that in a z-o and I dog you bag or something do you uh do you?

704
00:45:02.28 --> 00:45:06.52
On the inside do you actually feel bad that you have to do? Yes, you have to you feel bad

705
00:45:06.52 --> 00:45:13.64
Yeah, I don't like I don't like I don't like messing with waitresses. I don't like you know anybody in service, right?

706
00:45:14.20 --> 00:45:20.84
You know anybody in service. I don't like being that guy. Yeah, the the proverbial guy, right? That's like

707
00:45:21.72 --> 00:45:27.000
Yeah, man. Can you hurry up with that? Yeah, you know I'm the guy that be like a you know

708
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.32
I guess I guess I'm not drinking water and I haven't seen a long run awhile

709
00:45:31.32 --> 00:45:33.32
Well

710
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:39.32
But hey, you know when someone does good service like I'm definitely gonna take care of them too

711
00:45:39.88 --> 00:45:45.64
Yeah, you know, that's what we're doing but that's Jessica right we get this she's sort of she's got honestly

712
00:45:45.64 --> 00:45:50.04
She's kind of like a female Johnny in a way, right? She's smart. She's good looking

713
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
She's witty but

714
00:45:53.16 --> 00:45:57.000
Maybe not the best choices maybe she didn't roll out in the best environment and

715
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.86
And that's addressed to in the book you know there's some there's some level of ownership that gets you know

716
00:46:01.86 --> 00:46:08.04
Responsibility for our actions and she's the one that kind of pushes that like hey you can sit around here because

717
00:46:08.52 --> 00:46:17.34
At a certain point I don't get too much into it, but Johnny started saying well, you know we didn't I didn't have the right up bringing in all this and she's like hey dude

718
00:46:17.96 --> 00:46:19.96
No one made you quit

719
00:46:19.96 --> 00:46:23.48
school no one made you do this no one made you you did those things

720
00:46:23.48 --> 00:46:28.84
Um, but like you said these are these are

721
00:46:29.96 --> 00:46:36.60
These are people these are normal people these are people in the world these are people I grew up with these are my friends to this day

722
00:46:38.04 --> 00:46:40.04
People I met along the way

723
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.36
Now

724
00:46:42.36 --> 00:46:47.16
That's kind of your main characters one more character I want to introduce and they look there's a bunch

725
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:49.48
There are a lot more characters in the book

726
00:46:49.48 --> 00:46:55.64
I didn't say a lot more I tried to limit the number of characters as much as possible right I don't want to have this big complex

727
00:46:57.48 --> 00:47:03.88
Story line that's hard to follow. I wanted it to be when you heard someone I want you just to know who it is and boom your locked

728
00:47:04.60 --> 00:47:06.60
That was my goal simplicity

729
00:47:09.08 --> 00:47:11.08
There's another character

730
00:47:11.08 --> 00:47:16.12
That I want I do want to bring up because he does you got some he's got some a little bit of impact

00:49:59.88 --> 00:50:06.12
goat stand up goat stands up straight and belts out I said I got your caned ham

774
00:50:07.96 --> 00:50:12.12
Jerry shakes his head he tries to think of an original comeback but he can't think of anything good

775
00:50:12.84 --> 00:50:17.96
He resorts to all he knows well you just keep running your mouth like that and we'll see if you ever make

776
00:50:17.96 --> 00:50:19.96
Supervisor

777
00:50:19.96 --> 00:50:23.88
Not wanting to engage in a verbal battle Jerry quickly walks away

778
00:50:23.88 --> 00:50:30.52
goat stands there shaking his head mother fucker he says quietly

779
00:50:30.92 --> 00:50:35.32
Then unable to contain himself shouts supervise this you weasel look in mother fucker

780
00:50:37.08 --> 00:50:37.96
Johnny looks at him

781
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.12
I'd fucking kill myself if I ever made supervisor at this shit hole

782
00:50:42.76 --> 00:50:46.36
Yeah, not fucking prick walking around like he's fucking Steve Jobs

783
00:50:47.16 --> 00:50:48.76
loser fucking loser

784
00:50:48.76 --> 00:50:54.68
At least he's easy to rip off Johnny concedes he has got that going form

785
00:50:55.80 --> 00:50:58.60
I'm getting a couple bottles of jack tonight goats has

786
00:50:59.32 --> 00:51:02.60
getting the nasty as rot gut gin I can find

787
00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:14.44
So there you go that's the manager have you ever had a manager like like my boy like the weasel

788
00:51:14.44 --> 00:51:15.64
Yes, there you go

789
00:51:15.64 --> 00:51:17.64
God

790
00:51:17.88 --> 00:51:24.36
Do I need to do character development or do we know who Jerry the weasel lunch term is right?

791
00:51:24.36 --> 00:51:27.48
We're gonna use the schema unknown in the first and um

792
00:51:28.36 --> 00:51:33.96
I had so much fun writing that dialogue a her chocolate hard k dog behind the scenes over there chocolate

793
00:51:33.96 --> 00:51:40.44
I was wrong some of the just because that's what it's like right you know you're 22 23 years old

794
00:51:40.44 --> 00:51:42.44
You're having you have a crap job

795
00:51:42.44 --> 00:51:45.56
You know you don't they've broke

796
00:51:45.56 --> 00:51:53.64
Yeah, he was a stock boy at Target and she was a stockboy when he was a target and he was like 15

797
00:51:55.24 --> 00:51:59.32
And he's like you nailed the you nailed that dialogue you nailed those characters

798
00:51:59.32 --> 00:52:03.80
And I go how's that I said how can that be you weren't like that and he was no I wasn't like that

799
00:52:03.80 --> 00:52:08.20
I was 15 just trying to do a good job and trying to get money he goes but I worked with guys

800
00:52:08.20 --> 00:52:16.84
That shouldn't have been working there that we're 22 23 24 years old and I would hear them talking and you freaking nailed it

801
00:52:17.48 --> 00:52:19.96
He's guys talk to each other and talk shit

802
00:52:22.12 --> 00:52:25.64
So we all know managers like this kind of a

803
00:52:26.68 --> 00:52:28.68
stereotypical manager

804
00:52:29.72 --> 00:52:33.000
And that's the way the world kind of gets put together for this book now

805
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.96
Again, I don't want to spend I don't want to start covering the plot of the book you kind of heard it from the review a little bit of what happens in the plot

806
00:52:40.12 --> 00:52:45.48
You don't get the whole deal, but that's sort of the directional heading in gotta get the book to get there

807
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:49.32
But I did want to kind of just talk about some of the

808
00:52:50.04 --> 00:52:52.28
themes some of the other themes that are in the book

809
00:52:54.92 --> 00:52:57.32
One of them is is kind of this

810
00:52:57.32 --> 00:53:08.68
Ideal of being obsessed with random things which we all certainly do I do we all end up obsessed with these random things and if you look at it from the outside

811
00:53:08.84 --> 00:53:12.04
It doesn't make any sense so jiu jitsu

812
00:53:13.88 --> 00:53:15.08
surfing

813
00:53:15.08 --> 00:53:17.08
archery

814
00:53:17.08 --> 00:53:19.72
rock climbing music guitars

815
00:53:20.76 --> 00:53:22.76
NASCAR

816
00:53:22.76 --> 00:53:29.56
Leap lawn super into your lawn right super into fishing super into yoga super into cooking

817
00:53:29.88 --> 00:53:34.20
Super into grit like there's all these things that people just get into and

818
00:53:36.12 --> 00:53:38.12
That level of obsession

819
00:53:38.28 --> 00:53:44.12
Could be about anything right and that was that was one of the fun things that I had with already was

820
00:53:44.36 --> 00:53:48.32
I was thinking what would be the most random kind of thing that you could be obsessed with how about

821
00:53:48.32 --> 00:53:54.88
Laundry do laundry but there's not that much difference between being obsessed with doing laundry and and

822
00:53:55.44 --> 00:54:02.48
Archery yeah, and I'm believe me. I'm pretty obsessed with archery. I spend a bunch of time doing it. I spent money on it like

823
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:04.88
Why

824
00:54:04.88 --> 00:54:07.28
I could be making super clean clothes

825
00:54:07.28 --> 00:54:12.16
Jiu jitsu hey we're super in a jitsu yeah, we could talk about this freaking skill on this and that but

826
00:54:12.16 --> 00:54:18.48
At this point we have kind of the basic skills that we need to defend ourselves. We're just doing it

827
00:54:19.36 --> 00:54:26.48
All-nother reason right lawns right like lawn care people get fired up for that stuff

828
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:29.92
So that's something that we do

829
00:54:30.16 --> 00:54:37.04
It's an underlying theme in the book is man think about what you're doing. What do you obsess with why you obsess with it

830
00:54:37.76 --> 00:54:39.76
We're getting this weird stuff. Yeah

831
00:54:39.76 --> 00:54:41.76
Yeah, it is weird.

832
00:54:41.76 --> 00:54:43.76
consumerism

833
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:48.000
Buying stuff as another thing we do you wrap that you wrap the obsession around

834
00:54:48.56 --> 00:54:51.04
Also around a consumerism buying stuff and

835
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:56.80
If you've ever been to a big box store, which I certainly have been too many and

836
00:54:58.48 --> 00:55:00.48
Still go to

837
00:55:00.48 --> 00:55:02.72
Or Sasha should say still shop at because

838
00:55:03.20 --> 00:55:06.88
Because I don't go to them very often. I'm okay my wife kind of gets that done

839
00:55:06.88 --> 00:55:17.04
But you go into those places and it's so we consume a lot of stuff right and here's here's what I think is interesting and now I days you know this this this book takes place

840
00:55:18.72 --> 00:55:19.68
in the

841
00:55:19.68 --> 00:55:22.88
Early 90s late 80s. I'm gonna say early 90s

842
00:55:23.84 --> 00:55:25.84
So there's no cell phones

843
00:55:27.28 --> 00:55:31.20
But one thing that I've found that I think I believe and you can tell me what you think

844
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:34.88
I think we I think have you ever built something?

845
00:55:34.88 --> 00:55:38.80
Yes, sir. I have any gave that took you some time and effort

846
00:55:39.68 --> 00:55:43.52
What's the biggest thing you've ever built big biggest yeah, I don't know but

847
00:55:44.24 --> 00:55:46.24
That wasn't that did not come from IKEA

848
00:55:47.20 --> 00:55:56.56
Yeah, so okay, so I don't know the biggest thing that's gonna take a lot from me think of but the thing that did jump out at me was I used to make slingshots

849
00:55:56.56 --> 00:55:58.56
one of the kids okay so

850
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:04.48
You go down in my case I go down the valley the canyon

851
00:56:05.68 --> 00:56:11.84
And you'd find a guava tree and I like the guava tree would you and then you find where there's like a perfect

852
00:56:11.84 --> 00:56:16.64
Why it can be like too narrow of a split got to be any can't be too wide either a lot of those

853
00:56:17.20 --> 00:56:19.20
You got to find the perfect one

854
00:56:19.20 --> 00:56:22.64
When we cut it cut it all three spots and you bring it back

855
00:56:23.44 --> 00:56:25.20
You skin it

856
00:56:25.20 --> 00:56:27.44
Let it dry for a little bit like a few days or whatever

857
00:56:27.44 --> 00:56:32.40
I used it this is when I went extra on it. I'd sand it down so it looks kind of cool

858
00:56:33.20 --> 00:56:38.56
You can put finish on it. I never really did that and then you go by it's called surgical tubing

859
00:56:39.92 --> 00:56:44.08
Then you yeah, you attach them and then you cut off the tongue of your shoe

860
00:56:44.48 --> 00:56:48.16
I'm like an old shoe or whatever you cut it off and then poke the two holes

861
00:56:48.16 --> 00:56:54.48
Use a knife or even like a whole puncher. It's harder to do the whole puncher, but you know you did the two holes attach the

862
00:56:54.48 --> 00:56:57.12
Surgery surgical tubing what I would do is I do this

863
00:56:57.76 --> 00:57:02.16
Circle surgical tubing go in the hole curl back. I'd super glue it together

864
00:57:02.72 --> 00:57:09.60
Wrap it with thread not too tight because it might start cutting into when it starts to oxidize a little bit and then tape like small piece of tape

865
00:57:09.60 --> 00:57:13.12
It would be super strong super strong the same thing both sides are all four

866
00:57:13.92 --> 00:57:16.48
Attachments and boom there you go looks nice too

867
00:57:16.88 --> 00:57:22.32
How did you feel when you were complete? Yeah amazing that's why I do a bunch of them like I don't need like five slingshots

868
00:57:22.32 --> 00:57:27.84
But yeah, yeah, I got the two or three going so I think there's some I don't know there's probably some

869
00:57:28.48 --> 00:57:34.80
Chemical dopamine hit or whatever that get when you actually do something when you build something like I've built

870
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:45.60
So like like redoing my house like re-mod like ripping out gutting my hat one time I did my kitchen and I gutted it

871
00:57:45.60 --> 00:57:52.08
In 72 hours I gutted the whole thing demoed it got it out

872
00:57:52.48 --> 00:57:54.48
Readed the electrical read the plumbing

873
00:57:56.48 --> 00:58:02.000
Put in a sub box what's that called? I put in a sub box for the electrical

874
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.52
I forget what it's called but I put in like a whole new electrical system and then I dry walled it

875
00:58:07.52 --> 00:58:14.72
And I did that all in 72 hours and but you feel like accomplishment right?

876
00:58:16.32 --> 00:58:23.84
Building like fences at my houses building I I remodeled my other house so like these major projects

877
00:58:25.12 --> 00:58:27.60
You feel this good sense of satisfaction when you're done

878
00:58:28.80 --> 00:58:36.32
Well in the modern world we do a lot less of that right so what so you can replace that sort of satisfaction

879
00:58:36.32 --> 00:58:45.44
By clicking on the Amazon whatever by now right and all of a sudden you feel like but the thing is since you didn't put much effort into it

880
00:58:45.44 --> 00:58:50.80
It's not that gratifying so you want to do it again. Yeah, so I think that's why people roll in the freaking Costco

881
00:58:51.60 --> 00:58:57.52
They roll in the Costco and they roll out with way more stuff because they just walk through those eyes getting that dopamine hit

882
00:58:57.52 --> 00:58:59.60
Dopamine hit

883
00:59:00.32 --> 00:59:02.80
Because they feel like they built

884
00:59:02.80 --> 00:59:09.76
That thing or they harvest it. Yeah, it's the same thing when you go hunting and you like harvest the meat

885
00:59:10.56 --> 00:59:12.56
Super gratifying

886
00:59:12.56 --> 00:59:14.24
Super like

887
00:59:14.24 --> 00:59:16.24
1000 times more gratifying

888
00:59:17.12 --> 00:59:22.24
Then buying a stake at the store and believe me buying a stake at the store is kind of gratifying too

889
00:59:22.64 --> 00:59:25.68
But you get that dopamine you're like oh yeah, then we're this gonna be so good

890
00:59:25.92 --> 00:59:30.48
But it's way less so you buy another one, right? You know, then you buy this and you buy that right?

891
00:59:30.48 --> 00:59:33.20
Yeah, that's weird huh, so it's kind of like when you kind of

892
00:59:33.84 --> 00:59:38.24
Maybe cut it all the way down to what that's going on with that little transaction

893
00:59:38.56 --> 00:59:45.12
It's like you know like almost for like better way of putting it in the wild or in the you know nature whatever

894
00:59:45.36 --> 00:59:47.04
You put in this work and then you

895
00:59:47.60 --> 00:59:51.84
You run through some challenges you overcome those challenges then you get the reward right?

896
00:59:53.04 --> 00:59:55.52
That sort of the system and your brain

897
00:59:55.52 --> 01:00:00.40
You know follow along accordingly boom you put in the work you get obsessive over it

898
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:05.44
You run into a challenge you overcome the challenge and you're back on your path to you know for that main goal

899
01:00:05.52 --> 01:00:08.88
You know and the heart of you work the bigger the reward usually right?

900
01:00:08.88 --> 01:00:12.32
It's far as in your brain like the bigger the payoff you know, so it's like if you go for a

901
01:00:12.32 --> 01:00:17.60
College and then you then you really finally reap that reward in your case. It's hunting the elk or you know

902
01:00:17.60 --> 01:00:22.80
Whatever whatever the reward is the prize right there boom there's your your ultimate

903
01:00:22.80 --> 01:00:27.04
Satisfying dopamine hit whatever but now

904
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.12
It's the same thing except you reduce the work parts so much, but you still get the little reward

905
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.08
You know, but here's the thing you reduce the work the reward you get rewarded, but it's less work

906
01:00:38.48 --> 01:00:40.96
Less rewards, so what do you do you do to get less satisfying?

907
01:00:40.96 --> 01:00:44.96
Yeah, it's not much you just do it again. Oh, yeah, the culminate order this. I'm gonna buy that

908
01:00:45.36 --> 01:00:48.08
And see you end up in this sort of weird cycle of

909
01:00:48.08 --> 01:00:50.08
of

910
01:00:50.08 --> 01:00:52.40
Satisfaction by just buying stuff

911
01:00:52.40 --> 01:00:56.24
Brad the and you know, and we've talked about this two brothers the people who make the stores

912
01:00:56.64 --> 01:01:01.36
The layout and stuff all they know about that kind of stuff. That's why there's a thing called impulse buy right

913
01:01:01.36 --> 01:01:05.20
So they put the candy right there by the checkout stuff that you didn't plan on getting

914
01:01:05.20 --> 01:01:05.84
But it's like

915
01:01:05.84 --> 01:01:09.84
I think he's one of those right now. You know kind of a thing it's like a impulse by you ever get

916
01:01:11.04 --> 01:01:15.84
I don't see you doing this, but maybe you do I don't know, but you know when you shop it on Amazon right and

917
01:01:15.84 --> 01:01:22.24
And me I get a lot of care will relate to this where I get a lot of little cables and little tools

918
01:01:22.56 --> 01:01:27.76
In whatever you know just for this thing or that thing or whatever and then when you check out or when you add it to the cart

919
01:01:27.76 --> 01:01:29.76
They'll introduce all these other things

920
01:01:29.76 --> 01:01:31.76
You can't play it. It's a bot

921
01:01:31.76 --> 01:01:35.36
Yeah, then I'm like yeah, you sure you're like double me. No, no, oh, yeah

922
01:01:35.60 --> 01:01:40.40
I could use that never gonna use it, but I could imagine myself using this pair of pliers

923
01:01:40.64 --> 01:01:43.20
You know, so many I have two pairs of pliers by the way, I already

924
01:01:43.20 --> 01:01:49.04
But that one with the red handle and I was kind of dope. I'm headed as a little thing on the side. I am the I am the most

925
01:01:49.04 --> 01:01:54.08
I research stuff to the point where it's stupid you can try to get me to buy something

926
01:01:54.64 --> 01:01:56.64
I was looking at

927
01:01:56.64 --> 01:01:58.64
I was looking at one of my kids

928
01:01:59.76 --> 01:02:04.88
Yeah, my kids Instagram and my my daughter was like oh, I have an advertisement every third

929
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.64
Whatever picture is an advertisement

930
01:02:08.64 --> 01:02:14.80
And I go that no like oh, I hardly have any and I she's like no way and I showed her and I have like almost a no

931
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:16.48
Promoted ads

932
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:20.32
We know why I never click on them and they know I'm like low

933
01:02:21.12 --> 01:02:24.36
Low conversion conversion I'm like the lowest conversion ever

934
01:02:24.36 --> 01:02:30.88
I'm not even wasting their money throwing that thing you're crawling for me because you you could have the best freaking idea in the world

935
01:02:30.88 --> 01:02:33.68
And I'm gonna start like I'm gonna have to research that

936
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:39.28
Yeah, I'm surprised Amazon just doesn't check me out without showing me anything because they're just over

937
01:02:39.28 --> 01:02:41.28
But yeah, don't even try

938
01:02:42.64 --> 01:02:47.52
So that's an underlying theme, but here's here's the here's the kind of the real

939
01:02:48.96 --> 01:02:55.68
I don't know maybe it's that maybe it's the heaviest underlying theme is just the idea and it is it's about happiness, right?

940
01:02:57.36 --> 01:03:01.12
Not only about happiness, but this sort of underlying

941
01:03:01.12 --> 01:03:03.12
Being

942
01:03:03.52 --> 01:03:06.72
Unappiness in the world underlying sadness in the world

943
01:03:08.48 --> 01:03:16.96
When I was a kid and I was working in Wendy's and I saw a gene and I saw that she was freaking happy

944
01:03:21.20 --> 01:03:23.20
And I knew

945
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:25.20
That I wasn't

946
01:03:25.20 --> 01:03:33.04
And I didn't even know if I could be it didn't seem like an achievable thing it seemed like there was too much

947
01:03:34.64 --> 01:03:36.64
It seemed like there was too much

948
01:03:38.32 --> 01:03:40.32
Underlying

949
01:03:40.32 --> 01:03:43.04
Things in the world that just are gonna be bad

950
01:03:44.16 --> 01:03:45.36
Right

951
01:03:45.36 --> 01:03:52.56
And I always sense that in the world I always sensed always I always had this sense in the world of this underlying sadness

952
01:03:52.56 --> 01:03:55.20
Is underlying despair this underlying suffering

953
01:03:57.84 --> 01:04:04.08
And I don't want to use the term depression because maybe you wrap all those things together because depression seems like it's a clinical

954
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:08.48
Sort of like a problem that you treat type thing and I didn't feel like this was a clinical problem

955
01:04:10.08 --> 01:04:12.08
It just seemed like life to me

956
01:04:15.36 --> 01:04:17.36
Was not the gonna go the way you wanted it to go

957
01:04:17.36 --> 01:04:19.36
Go

958
01:04:20.64 --> 01:04:22.64
For anyone

959
01:04:23.52 --> 01:04:28.000
You're gonna end up in a wrong job you're gonna end up in the wrong relationship you're gonna something's gonna be wrong with your health

960
01:04:29.28 --> 01:04:31.28
Something's gonna be wrong in your family

961
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:36.80
And we're gonna die I we're all gonna die and before we died we're gonna suffer

962
01:04:38.16 --> 01:04:42.24
And by the way everyone that you know and everyone that you love is gonna suffer and die

963
01:04:42.24 --> 01:04:44.24
I

964
01:04:46.24 --> 01:04:52.24
And so I would always I kind of had this underlying sense of the world

965
01:04:54.40 --> 01:04:58.24
And then I would catch like glimpses of people that were happy and

966
01:05:00.40 --> 01:05:03.76
Sometimes it was someone like Jean there was another guy that worked at a freaking junkyard

967
01:05:04.56 --> 01:05:06.08
Who was kind of jacked?

968
01:05:06.08 --> 01:05:15.52
Especially when I was younger you know when you were younger and in the in the 70s if someone was jacked in the 70s like it was a whole

969
01:05:16.88 --> 01:05:18.88
It was like the next level right

970
01:05:19.44 --> 01:05:25.20
Because you're you're not used to seeing people that are jacked at all and I remember seeing this guy who has

971
01:05:25.20 --> 01:05:27.20
It worked at a junkyard and

972
01:05:27.20 --> 01:05:35.20
And he looked happy and I was like dude this guy's just jacked and just lived in engine parts around the junkyard

973
01:05:37.36 --> 01:05:39.36
And it seemed like he was happy

974
01:05:40.88 --> 01:05:42.88
So

975
01:05:42.88 --> 01:05:47.68
That's sort of this underlying team and I'll tell you like when I got to the teams thank god

976
01:05:49.12 --> 01:05:51.68
When I got to the teams that's when I started feeling like oh

977
01:05:51.68 --> 01:05:58.72
Like kind of happy like this is cool that people on with are kind of cool and life's not going to be perfect

978
01:05:58.72 --> 01:06:01.92
But we're going to have a good time living this imperfect life

979
01:06:02.48 --> 01:06:06.88
So I started to get a little bit relieved of that as I got a little as I got older

980
01:06:08.56 --> 01:06:10.56
But I think that

981
01:06:10.88 --> 01:06:13.92
You know Johnny kind of realizes that he's not going to be happy

982
01:06:16.24 --> 01:06:19.84
And this is the other sort of the other sort of underlying theme

983
01:06:19.84 --> 01:06:23.04
is this idea of

984
01:06:26.16 --> 01:06:28.16
Sacrifice and

985
01:06:29.04 --> 01:06:33.68
When Johnny realizes that he can't be happy or at least he doesn't think he can't happy

986
01:06:35.36 --> 01:06:40.80
He sees that you know kind of the way I looked at Jean the Wendy salad bar girl

987
01:06:41.92 --> 01:06:43.92
But that's his brother

988
01:06:43.92 --> 01:06:49.12
And the situation unfolds where he's not going to be able to be happy anymore where where

989
01:06:49.36 --> 01:06:51.20
Arty is not going to be happy anymore and

990
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:56.88
Johnny knows if he makes sacrifices he could preserve the happiness for his brother

991
01:06:58.32 --> 01:07:00.72
Especially because he's never going to be happy himself

992
01:07:02.08 --> 01:07:04.08
um

993
01:07:05.68 --> 01:07:11.28
You know I had this conversation with stoner one time we're out surfing and he was asking me that we said bro

994
01:07:11.28 --> 01:07:13.28
I don't know it's like the same thing

995
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:19.04
He's like bro, I'm never going to be out how you how am I ever going to be happy? I'm never going to be happy

996
01:07:19.44 --> 01:07:21.68
You know we were literally it's like a beautiful

997
01:07:22.48 --> 01:07:25.68
Southern California we're out in our surf spot

998
01:07:26.24 --> 01:07:31.44
For whatever reason there's not many guys out there's a little offshore breeze the waters warm

999
01:07:31.84 --> 01:07:37.92
It's a you know chest to head high swell pretty consistent like it's it doesn't get any better

1000
01:07:37.92 --> 01:07:44.96
Hmm and he's out of here saying to me like I don't know how do you ever how you ever find happiness and I'm like bro

1001
01:07:45.20 --> 01:07:50.64
This is it man. This is it right here and that's what you

1002
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.60
Know that's what that's what you have to be able to find

1003
01:07:56.40 --> 01:08:00.40
You have to be able to find that the path that you're on

1004
01:08:00.40 --> 01:08:07.04
Would even though it's challenging even though they're suffering that's that's the happiness too

1005
01:08:11.36 --> 01:08:19.84
And the sacrifice part is putting others above yourself. You know and obviously on this podcast we talk about heroes and we talk to heroes in many cases

1006
01:08:19.84 --> 01:08:29.20
And both the ones that we talk to here are military people right soldiers sailors airman Marines

1007
01:08:31.04 --> 01:08:32.88
But those aren't the only people

1008
01:08:32.88 --> 01:08:39.20
It doesn't the only people in the world that are heroes right and and I'm not just talking about law enforcement and you know firefighters and first responders

1009
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:44.08
Well, there's all kinds of people in the world that put others above themselves

1010
01:08:44.08 --> 01:08:50.32
And put other people's happiness above themselves and

1011
01:08:51.60 --> 01:08:54.60
And whether that's mothers and fathers and

1012
01:08:57.36 --> 01:09:03.36
Sisters and brothers and wives and husband and friends. I mean there's friends that do that

1013
01:09:03.36 --> 01:09:12.40
Friends that put other people's happiness and other people's success above themselves and

1014
01:09:14.80 --> 01:09:19.36
Really that's that's the underl... that's one of the other underlying themes of the book

1015
01:09:20.96 --> 01:09:28.88
Is and that you know that's that's a theme that's consistent with all the books that have written fiction nonfiction people that are putting others above themselves

1016
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:32.16
That's what leadership is and

1017
01:09:32.16 --> 01:09:34.16
Ultimately

1018
01:09:36.48 --> 01:09:38.48
That's what life is about

1019
01:09:40.88 --> 01:09:42.88
So

1020
01:09:44.48 --> 01:09:48.16
I think if you can put other others before yourselves

1021
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:54.40
Then if we do that then you can find some happiness and add a minimum at a minimum

1022
01:09:56.08 --> 01:09:58.80
You can leave the world in better condition than you found it

1023
01:09:58.80 --> 01:10:00.80
And

1024
01:10:01.68 --> 01:10:05.04
If you can pull that off I think if you can pull that off

1025
01:10:06.40 --> 01:10:11.04
Then you can die with a clean and conscience and you can die with a smile on your face

1026
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:17.28
And you can leave a smile on the face of the people you left behind

1027
01:10:20.64 --> 01:10:22.64
And that's a good life

1028
01:10:25.28 --> 01:10:27.28
And that is

1029
01:10:27.28 --> 01:10:29.28
I mean

1030
01:10:32.56 --> 01:10:34.000
So

1031
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.48
We can't obviously cover the whole plot the details what we'll do is maybe in a year

1032
01:10:38.96 --> 01:10:40.56
Remember what we did with

1033
01:10:40.56 --> 01:10:44.16
Musashi yeah with Musashi so this is episode

1034
01:10:44.48 --> 01:10:46.80
301

1035
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:48.80
episode 401

1036
01:10:49.36 --> 01:10:51.36
That's actually two years isn't it?

1037
01:10:51.36 --> 01:10:53.36
Yeah

1038
01:10:53.36 --> 01:11:00.40
People two years to sort it out is that long not what we do one year so we do so we say 350

1039
01:11:02.40 --> 01:11:09.60
Okay, we'll go 350 will shoot for 350 so 350 will do full spoiler will just tell everyone what's going on

1040
01:11:09.92 --> 01:11:11.92
We'll take a bunch of questions about the book

1041
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:19.04
And yeah, we'll do it again what we can go a little bit deeper on all the plot

1042
01:11:19.04 --> 01:11:26.48
You know as I start getting feedback from people and people start asking all those awesome questions that you ask when you read books and what's this part about?

1043
01:11:26.48 --> 01:11:28.96
What is this represent we'll do all that?

1044
01:11:30.08 --> 01:11:32.08
The books for for sale right now

1045
01:11:34.24 --> 01:11:38.40
I would order it if I were you why I think clearly because you want that first of this

1046
01:11:39.28 --> 01:11:43.28
And there's another this is us against the establishment by the way

1047
01:11:43.76 --> 01:11:46.24
This is us against the literary critics

1048
01:11:46.24 --> 01:11:51.12
Right this is us against the big publishing companies the media companies

1049
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:55.60
Where did the outsiders I'm an outsider I'm telling you what I go to New York City

1050
01:11:56.88 --> 01:12:02.72
And I roll into those publishing offices I am an outsider I might as well be purple

1051
01:12:06.72 --> 01:12:08.80
Because I'm not from that world right

1052
01:12:09.60 --> 01:12:12.96
They don't they the interesting thing is I mean I was an English major in college

1053
01:12:12.96 --> 01:12:18.40
They don't know about that they just look at me think knuckle dragger

1054
01:12:19.68 --> 01:12:22.16
Meathead which I take is a compliment. Yes, certainly

1055
01:12:24.88 --> 01:12:26.88
But yeah, they don't want us to win so

1056
01:12:28.08 --> 01:12:30.08
Join the cause right

1057
01:12:30.08 --> 01:12:32.56
Let's let's let's let's take the fight to them

1058
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.68
Get that first edition and here's the other thing I was planning to do a

1059
01:12:37.68 --> 01:12:46.32
Speaking thing kind of like jockel live what we did last year right before COVID hit I was we were booking it up and the whole freaking

1060
01:12:47.92 --> 01:12:54.56
The industry still paranoid and a bunch of the venues started getting crazy with the way they were gonna run them and some of them wanted to cancel

1061
01:12:55.12 --> 01:13:01.36
And so I said all right fine, we'll put it off so I'm gonna do a jockel live tour with this

1062
01:13:01.76 --> 01:13:04.40
I don't know I don't know what cities I'm going to the only city I

1063
01:13:04.40 --> 01:13:07.84
Keep saying I want to go to is Detroit

1064
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:14.32
I just want to go to Detroit and by the way, there's so you knew Jack White is

1065
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.40
Jack White stripes. Oh, I'm thinking totally

1066
01:13:19.12 --> 01:13:22.96
No, I do now. Yeah, so he's got a thing up in

1067
01:13:23.76 --> 01:13:25.12
Detroit

1068
01:13:25.12 --> 01:13:26.32
He's got a

1069
01:13:26.32 --> 01:13:28.32
place where he can record

1070
01:13:29.20 --> 01:13:30.72
Bands

1071
01:13:30.72 --> 01:13:32.72
Straight to vinyl

1072
01:13:32.72 --> 01:13:37.28
So it just straight to vinyl. I think it's a venue that holds like 50 people

1073
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.88
So I want to do jockel live there. I want to record it straight to the white

1074
01:13:41.52 --> 01:13:43.52
Yeah, and this get

1075
01:13:43.52 --> 01:13:47.20
Artisan on us yeah, bro straight to vinyl house

1076
01:13:47.60 --> 01:13:51.04
I think it might be the only place in America where you can do that

1077
01:13:52.24 --> 01:13:56.40
That sounds correct and plus the white stripes are awesome jackwights freaking awesome

1078
01:13:56.40 --> 01:14:01.60
So that would be sick to do so I'm gonna try and go to Detroit maybe after do a big show before that

1079
01:14:02.72 --> 01:14:04.72
To get everyone in there, but then after that

1080
01:14:05.12 --> 01:14:07.12
We'll go straight to third man records

1081
01:14:07.44 --> 01:14:09.12
Straight to vinyl

1082
01:14:09.12 --> 01:14:11.12
Do you have a record player? Yeah

1083
01:14:11.76 --> 01:14:18.32
Let's look into that one one my Amazon spirals the record player they have a lot. Oh, he's yeah

1084
01:14:18.56 --> 01:14:23.44
It's vinyl dude. Yeah, it's not going right. It's just we're talking about people being obsessed with things

1085
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:28.96
Yeah, vinyl's one of them yeah get that vinyl out that record sounds better allegedly

1086
01:14:29.68 --> 01:14:35.84
I remember there's there's a motorhead album where he put in between the songs on the CD

1087
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:38.72
Has like the record sound like this

1088
01:14:40.32 --> 01:14:45.28
Come out back pretty sick, right? Yeah, well that's I mean even with film that's all right

1089
01:14:45.28 --> 01:14:48.96
It's like no film looks like way better video end and photography

1090
01:14:48.96 --> 01:14:51.52
They're like not film all day. Yeah, I'll walk

1091
01:14:51.52 --> 01:14:58.32
Black did this lame lame doesn't look as good does it look as natural doesn't look as you know

1092
01:14:58.96 --> 01:15:00.96
Doesn't flow with your senses

1093
01:15:01.60 --> 01:15:06.16
So Detroit that's one city. I know I'm going to why cuz we want to get flow with our senses

1094
01:15:06.16 --> 01:15:09.92
Yes, sir. We're going straight to vinyl industry to vinyl. I don't even know if it's a possible thing

1095
01:15:11.36 --> 01:15:12.64
I don't I don't know if it's possible

1096
01:15:12.64 --> 01:15:16.40
Bet you know people might be like you can't do that you need you're not even a band

1097
01:15:16.80 --> 01:15:19.84
No, I'm gonna talk though. Yeah, it's an out you've done albums

1098
01:15:19.84 --> 01:15:24.40
We have no withdrawing milk right so this would be an album now. I'm straight up

1099
01:15:25.20 --> 01:15:30.24
You've been to jockel lives. Yes, sir. I have some of the money being cool record right

1100
01:15:30.56 --> 01:15:32.56
Yes, sir. They would be

1101
01:15:32.56 --> 01:15:38.56
vinyl vinyl all day man. Then you get clear vinyl you get the red vinyl right? You don't say

1102
01:15:38.56 --> 01:15:42.72
I don't know what red vinyl is but the vinyl's red that's what red vinyl is where you get the clear vinyl

1103
01:15:42.72 --> 01:15:45.84
What's clear vinyl clear the record's clear you can see through it

1104
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:51.68
You're heard of it. I never heard of that okay dogs in the house in the game. Yeah, oh

1105
01:15:52.48 --> 01:15:58.72
So when I do that thing, but I guess it's gonna be spring or something like that we'll go live

1106
01:16:00.16 --> 01:16:04.48
We'll hang out if you're rolling up you got that second edition. Let's face it

1107
01:16:05.60 --> 01:16:07.60
I'm still appreciative

1108
01:16:08.72 --> 01:16:12.000
But you know I know we all know where you're at

1109
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.24
Yeah, appreciate the support. Let's crush the world with this book

1110
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:23.92
Echo speaking of crush in the world we kind of have to crush ourselves

1111
01:16:25.04 --> 01:16:29.36
Right in order to crush the world which by the way. Hey, you tougher. Yeah, which by the way

1112
01:16:29.36 --> 01:16:35.68
I came just came back from hunting and for I think it was 13 days. I did not lift weights

1113
01:16:36.32 --> 01:16:38.32
Because I was in the mountains

1114
01:16:38.32 --> 01:16:45.68
Or as I call mountains but I came back and I was all fired up, you know and felt like I need

1115
01:16:46.24 --> 01:16:48.80
Man I have domes in my arms right now

1116
01:16:49.52 --> 01:16:51.84
In my I haven't had domes in my arms in a long time

1117
01:16:54.32 --> 01:16:58.56
So we got across ourselves that can take a toll at times

1118
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:02.96
What do we need to do to kind of stay on the path to get better? Well, so we across the world

1119
01:17:02.96 --> 01:17:09.84
Well, keep in mind mentally and physically. Domes in the arms that indicates that you're working out your arms which I respect

1120
01:17:11.04 --> 01:17:14.32
So you know, I'm sorry they have the dump but welcome to my world

1121
01:17:19.84 --> 01:17:28.72
Well, okay, so we want to minimize domes. Well, no, no maximize yet minimize mitigate domes. Okay. Yeah, I would say that's a good call. It's kind of a dichotomy really

1122
01:17:28.72 --> 01:17:37.84
Mm-hmm, but let's face it would you would you want to have domes every day on your arms with that include that

1123
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:40.72
Increased progress or not

1124
01:17:41.44 --> 01:17:46.40
If you bad, right you know, I obviously there's a lot to it, but generally speaking simply put

1125
01:17:46.72 --> 01:17:50.40
Domes every day. No, probably not okay. You want when the domes heels

1126
01:17:50.80 --> 01:17:53.44
Then you want to elicit more domes and what do I have?

1127
01:17:53.44 --> 01:17:59.76
But that's a process is then it's ongoing unless all right what you do need a supplementation that'll help you

1128
01:17:59.76 --> 01:18:01.76
Do domes or no domes right on you

1129
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:09.44
So through this path rolling on supplementation is very helpful. So we'll talk about energy drinks first

1130
01:18:09.84 --> 01:18:13.04
Right as far as energy see I know I said it energy drinks

1131
01:18:13.60 --> 01:18:18.000
As if that is if what we're talking about fits in with all the other categories of all these other

1132
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.76
Drinks that are in the energy drink category. Yeah, so man, you know me if you're new to this when they're not

1133
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:28.16
There's things that they don't don't that stigma that you felt like in your brain

1134
01:18:28.16 --> 01:18:33.84
I would ever order you drink so that stigma don't worry about that that's dig many more in fact forget that's digma forget it

1135
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:38.88
Don't totally forget it because there's other drinks that still have you need to keep the stigma in mind

1136
01:18:39.12 --> 01:18:44.000
Yeah, but you can have the stigma of waitings. Yes, like you'd like like detach from the state

1137
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.28
Yeah, but that leave it behind just leave it behind it doesn't control your brain and how you think of energy drinks

1138
01:18:49.52 --> 01:18:51.92
necessarily anymore if you know about

1139
01:18:52.96 --> 01:18:57.52
Jocco go okay, I can is a discipline go or jocco go it is

1140
01:18:57.84 --> 01:19:03.52
Jocco discipline go like I agree speaking I got corrected by someone on the inside which I respected by the way

1141
01:19:03.52 --> 01:19:05.52
But either way

1142
01:19:05.52 --> 01:19:06.56
Go

1143
01:19:06.56 --> 01:19:12.72
Jocco discipline go said energy drink that is good for you front to back good for you not the kind where you drinking

1144
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:14.72
And

1145
01:19:14.72 --> 01:19:18.56
You know what have you ever seen that there's this commercial I think one of these comedy YouTube

1146
01:19:20.08 --> 01:19:24.96
Channels they're like oh if some like if energy drink commercials were honest or whatever they call it like a

1147
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
A metal tube of

1148
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:34.16
Psychedelic poison and something but if they they kept referring to it as a metal tube but some kind of place

1149
01:19:34.88 --> 01:19:39.28
Accurate yeah, oh, Brad watch the video. It's funny. You're like they own that is all true

1150
01:19:39.28 --> 01:19:44.80
That is it's interesting either way it's not that the stomach of the sis no poison

1151
01:19:44.80 --> 01:19:47.52
It's different. Yeah, actually good for you. It's good for you. It's like a health

1152
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:52.40
Drink energy drink, but even though that makes it sound kind of like not really what it feels like

1153
01:19:53.12 --> 01:19:58.40
Just keep in mind. It's an energy drink a taste good is good and it's good for you and

1154
01:19:58.80 --> 01:20:02.000
gives you energy and gives you legit no chemicals

1155
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.44
These weird preservative things because of process high quality it's quality

1156
01:20:08.32 --> 01:20:11.92
Many flavors the best in which is mango factually

1157
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:18.40
Yeah, but you're gonna have to choose for yourself on that one. It's called jocco go. Oh

1158
01:20:18.40 --> 01:20:25.84
That junk warfare. Yes, sir. To come into it. Yeah, I I must say even joint welfare has its limitations because I

1159
01:20:25.84 --> 01:20:34.16
Need more right now. I take it every day. Thank God because otherwise I might need to be completely immobilized right now

1160
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:38.32
Well, you're delayed up here's thing drone warfare is not gonna help your dogs. I really I mean

1161
01:20:38.32 --> 01:20:41.68
I mean me what is the problem the problem the protein protein is not help your dog

1162
01:20:42.24 --> 01:20:45.44
So joints joint warfare super curl

1163
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:49.28
Right but when it comes to actual rebuild

1164
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.20
We need to go moke. Yep. That's for the muscle. Yes

1165
01:20:53.20 --> 01:20:57.68
Additional protein in the form of the dessert. I know what I had for breakfast this morning

1166
01:20:58.08 --> 01:20:59.84
Which I normally don't eat moke

1167
01:21:01.12 --> 01:21:06.56
Guess what I had for lunch? Moke because I could I knew what you just don't look the doms

1168
01:21:06.56 --> 01:21:12.24
I know it needs to be yes, sir. I need to repair my muscles. Oh yeah freaking so or dude

1169
01:21:13.04 --> 01:21:18.40
By the way, speaking of moke the the new and you actually all the ingredients were in front of my face

1170
01:21:18.40 --> 01:21:25.12
But you turn me on to this or to the precursor of this new formula for the ultimate moke shake depends on what flavor

1171
01:21:25.12 --> 01:21:27.12
You like but if you like the chocolate one, this is the one

1172
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:30.56
Mint chocolate or dark chocolate or a

1173
01:21:30.56 --> 01:21:32.56
Peanut butter chocolate whichever one you want

1174
01:21:33.68 --> 01:21:37.20
Half of a half of a frozen banana over right

1175
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:42.80
Tulsi gear return me on to that. Okay, so we got it you know a little a collab going on

1176
01:21:42.80 --> 01:21:47.76
Frozen half a frozen banana two scoops of the moke. I did the darkness

1177
01:21:48.48 --> 01:21:54.000
Soy milk you know cuz like soy silk. I don't know whatever the one that it doesn't have lactose in it

1178
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.16
It's super low, okay if you go regular milk and you're concerned about if you're trying to go lower on the calorie thing

1179
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:04.88
Regular milk even 2% is not the best one for

1180
01:22:05.12 --> 01:22:07.92
Because I'm over here on the whole milk. Yeah, I'm strong

1181
01:22:08.40 --> 01:22:09.68
Half and half. Oh, you're not

1182
01:22:09.68 --> 01:22:13.20
Open this you know well you're not going on a lower calorie scenario

1183
01:22:13.20 --> 01:22:17.92
It's basic you can't you know your little machine can't handle that can stuff you know way if you are

1184
01:22:17.92 --> 01:22:22.72
This is the deal because I was gonna give it to the kids for the ultimate front end test you seem saying

1185
01:22:23.12 --> 01:22:25.12
Anyway, you go half

1186
01:22:25.12 --> 01:22:30.56
Soy milk or almond milk whatever the unsweetened one and then half of that it's lactose free

1187
01:22:30.56 --> 01:22:34.64
It was the chocolate milk that you you mentioned. Oh, yeah, it's like lactose free

1188
01:22:34.72 --> 01:22:38.24
There's way less sugar and it's like double triple filtered or whatever

1189
01:22:38.24 --> 01:22:43.52
Yeah, and you go half that too. Oh just for the extra boost of chocolate or whatever

1190
01:22:44.72 --> 01:22:47.04
Man drink that on a taste like ice cream

1191
01:22:47.04 --> 01:22:51.20
I think the banana but it's not a whole banana so you don't get the real super banana flavor

1192
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:55.44
But you get the sweetness from the banana and probably taste like it's ice cream for real

1193
01:22:55.44 --> 01:23:00.32
Yeah, oh yeah put ice in there boom mix that up there you go milk protein in the form of a

1194
01:23:00.32 --> 01:23:06.32
Highly desirable dessert highly desir highly desir highly I'm just right now already have two

1195
01:23:09.04 --> 01:23:13.92
That's a well it's true also chocolate tea you're into tea you know something light

01:23:14.48 --> 01:23:18.80
That's the OG that's the original is the OG oh yeah you like it is the OG

1197
01:23:18.80 --> 01:23:24.40
I was never a tea drinker to be honest with you and but I was and I was surprised about how many like

It's energy is an actual thing. Yeah, it's it's a hener graces got something

1205
01:23:55.04 --> 01:24:01.84
It's hener graces charisma his whole oh that's his you know like yeah, you know when he talks he's like he's real brother

1206
01:24:01.84 --> 01:24:07.04
That guy's on it man. Yeah, listen. They guy talk forever and that energy that he brings that's a

1207
01:24:07.04 --> 01:24:11.92
Energy straight up. I thought it was like he made mix some food up, you know

1208
01:24:12.24 --> 01:24:17.36
Maybe an Aussie bowl, but that was a energy one. I think the presentation of that yeah

1209
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:22.64
What's the energy so I'm just saying we got what we need to talk to the to hener then and get it you know

1210
01:24:22.64 --> 01:24:25.92
Maybe he could approve of the energy drink over here

1211
01:24:26.72 --> 01:24:31.20
What I think it's in the present it so I'm just saying it might be might be I don't know

1212
01:24:31.44 --> 01:24:36.72
Maybe maybe not but it might be misleading to say hey they are considered henergie drinks you see I'm saying

1213
01:24:37.52 --> 01:24:42.000
So okay, so this was not officially endorsed by hener

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.88
Yes, okay, but if you want to get these drinks

Impressive jeans and I care about more elements of jeans as far as when you put on jeans then then this jocco guy

1229
01:25:55.52 --> 01:26:00.40
You care about a number of things which are critical and fundamental. I get it functionality. Yes, sir

1230
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:04.24
There's all I care about yes sir and in life, but me I care about the fit

1231
01:26:04.80 --> 01:26:09.84
You know when I put on the jeans I live it is part of functionality. Yes in my opinion. Okay, I care about the aesthetic

1232
01:26:10.40 --> 01:26:13.44
fit as well. Okay, yeah, I understand yes, sir

1233
01:26:13.44 --> 01:26:16.72
So you know when I'm in the mirror. I look in the mirror and I look at myself

1234
01:26:19.28 --> 01:26:23.60
And I look at my wife next to me and if she's like giving me the approval that means a lot

1235
01:26:25.12 --> 01:26:28.08
Same versus I put them on and she's like

1236
01:26:28.96 --> 01:26:31.20
Stolic face maybe saw our face

1237
01:26:31.20 --> 01:26:38.16
Wow, that's gonna be rough and you know, let's see what else maybe you have like those types of reactions that means that means just to me

1238
01:26:38.16 --> 01:26:45.92
Seems saying my wife is just stoked. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know why she's stoked because you put on the Delta 68 like it is in my case look

1239
01:26:45.92 --> 01:26:51.36
Maybe it doesn't mean much you nonetheless it still reaps the same benefits you seem saying and your wife my wife

1240
01:26:51.92 --> 01:26:56.16
They're there to convey you know they're approving that and around week. Oh you seem saying

1241
01:26:56.64 --> 01:27:01.92
So it doesn't matter if you notice or not or gen USA dot called oh yeah American made so

1242
01:27:02.56 --> 01:27:05.20
When I say American made it doesn't mean we

1243
01:27:05.20 --> 01:27:12.28
A symbol them you know no in you know this zone and grown grown and

1244
01:27:12.64 --> 01:27:19.44
Sound right here in America everything from the real building this whole freaking country bringing manufacturing back to here

1245
01:27:19.44 --> 01:27:22.08
That's what we're doing. Yeah, I do some great stuff over there

1246
01:27:22.64 --> 01:27:29.52
Also jacquoise store it's called jacquoise store that's where you can get your shirts and hats and hoodies anything you want to wear to represent the path

1247
01:27:30.88 --> 01:27:32.88
Discipline equals freedom

1248
01:27:32.88 --> 01:27:37.44
You can go deep on the idea of disciplinical freedom by the way. Yes, you can

1249
01:27:38.88 --> 01:27:42.72
Sometimes kind of hunt it hard to understand but when you understand I mean I wrote a whole day of book about it

1250
01:27:42.72 --> 01:27:44.08
So

1251
01:27:44.08 --> 01:27:46.08
We say I would

1252
01:27:46.08 --> 01:27:49.20
Yes, sir, yes, sir, nonetheless you want to represent every time I could go to

1253
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.84
I have gone beat well, I'm thinking you know how okay you ever elicent a music when you work up? Yes, okay

1254
01:27:55.84 --> 01:27:59.36
So sometimes I will do sometimes sometimes a little as a podcast depending on the podcast

1255
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:04.72
Sometimes a podcast can distract you from the workout by the way, so keep that in my but every once in a while

1256
01:28:04.72 --> 01:28:06.72
I'll I'll go with nothing

1257
01:28:06.72 --> 01:28:12.48
Not listening to anything good that's when your mind like you find your mind just going deep on some random thing

1258
01:28:12.48 --> 01:28:15.60
That's always in front of your face or whatever and that's what happened recently to me

1259
01:28:15.92 --> 01:28:17.44
Discipline was freedom

1260
01:28:17.44 --> 01:28:21.92
And you man I have the freedom to do all this stuff, but I'm not gonna do it because I'm disciplined you seem saying

1261
01:28:22.80 --> 01:28:27.60
And you can go deep in your own mind anyway if you're representing that you can get your shirts and hats and

1262
01:28:27.60 --> 01:28:34.64
It is a bunch of other stuff on jockelstore dot com also we have a subscription situation called the shirt locker

1263
01:28:36.72 --> 01:28:42.88
Kind of an exclusive deal, you know, it's a monthly thing you get a new shirt different from the from the

1264
01:28:42.88 --> 01:28:44.72

It's like the exclusive it's available to anybody

1266
01:28:49.36 --> 01:28:51.36
It's really exclusive

1267
01:28:51.36 --> 01:28:54.16
If you're part of the shirt locker you're wearing your shirt locker shirts

1268

Someone who's not part of the shirt locker. They see your shirt. They're gonna be like hey, where can I get that you seem saying?

In case things get

1280
01:29:52.64 --> 01:29:54.64
tyrannical around here

1281
01:29:55.28 --> 01:29:57.92
Maybe I don't think they will but

1282
01:29:58.80 --> 01:30:05.68
Some days I wake up thinking maybe they will so anyways we've built to platform that we can operate on with pure

1283
01:30:06.08 --> 01:30:10.48
Independence and not have to rely on the current platforms that we're on we hope it doesn't come to that

1284
01:30:10.48 --> 01:30:14.96
But if it does we would be foolish for us not to have a contingency plan if you want to help us with that

1285
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:19.52
You want to be a part of that go to jockel underground dot com because eight dollars and 18 cents a month

01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:26.56
$8.18 some of but listen if you can't afford that

1288

So if you want to if you want to help us out there go to jockel underground dot com yeah that one's good

1294
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:53.68
It's um and the way I you know

1295
01:30:53.68 --> 01:30:58.80
He like you go along with a certain thing and you could try to evaluate and maybe sum up like what is this?

1296
01:30:58.80 --> 01:31:05.20
What is this right and you know you say Q&A which it is essentially but it's like it's kind of like when you go through life

1297
01:31:05.20 --> 01:31:07.60
Whether be currently or before whatever

1298
01:31:08.72 --> 01:31:11.52
I'm just saying you think about your past you think about the present

1299
01:31:11.52 --> 01:31:16.16
Uh, this all these weird question what what but like this is a funny way of saying it

1300
01:31:16.16 --> 01:31:18.16
You know me dear before

1301
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:24.32
It is true. It is true. Yeah, yeah, nonetheless you're still gonna have like

1302
01:31:24.32 --> 01:31:28.72
Like you know how there's like questions rolling around like what does this what does this mean like what's my take on this?

1303
01:31:28.72 --> 01:31:33.20
Not the end of the day, you know if you're the kind of ask ask that question to yourself

1304
01:31:33.60 --> 01:31:38.56
I think you offer really good like you're take on it and it's usually really informed usually

1305
01:31:38.56 --> 01:31:45.76
Um and it can kind of help a lot of us make sense out of certain elements of life, you know

1306
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:50.64
Whether be the specific questions that people ask or the first part that we talk about like you know

1307
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:57.84
Is our is our our children soft now, you know, it's society becoming soft or like you know

1308
01:31:57.84 --> 01:32:00.56
So coming to the to the trick of advertising

1309
01:32:01.60 --> 01:32:04.48
That can stuff like that's real stuff that we're dealing with like daily, you know

1310
01:32:04.48 --> 01:32:06.48
Yeah, I think it brings awareness

1311
01:32:06.48 --> 01:32:07.12
Yeah

1312
01:32:07.12 --> 01:32:09.28
We talk about if I wanted to scare you

1313
01:32:10.16 --> 01:32:15.68
But I told you hey, I'm gonna be in the house and I'm gonna scare you what are my chances of being able to scare you?

1314
01:32:16.72 --> 01:32:19.60
Almost zero if you don't know

1315
01:32:21.44 --> 01:32:26.96
And I would say I'm 99.9% gonna scare you

1316
01:32:28.16 --> 01:32:30.16
So with life

1317
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:32.32
If you

1318
01:32:32.32 --> 01:32:38.08
Have an opportunity to think through a problem or think through a question before you actually have to contend with it

1319
01:32:38.08 --> 01:32:39.76
It's gonna make you

1320
01:32:39.76 --> 01:32:46.40
unscarable yeah, so just that's as another I think that's the benefit of the jocconerground.com

1321
01:32:46.96 --> 01:32:52.16
podcast is where addressing those kind of things to get you in that situation where you can't be scared

1322
01:32:52.64 --> 01:32:55.76
Or you you're ready to deal with whatever's in front. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully

1323
01:32:57.76 --> 01:32:59.76

1387
01:37:36.80 --> 01:37:42.96
Because you all are out there providing security and stability through your service

1398
01:38:38.64 --> 01:38:41.60

01:38:43.52 --> 01:38:47.76
