[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 193 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:09] I often say that I was raised in the sealed teams.
[00:00:17] And I was actually, I mean, I didn't join the Navy until I was 18 years old,
[00:00:23] but once I was in, the team was the only thing I knew.
[00:00:28] And when I got in, what happened when you got to a team was you got in line?
[00:00:37] You got on board with the program. You got taught how to act.
[00:00:44] Not just how to fire maneuver, not just how to shoot, move and communicate.
[00:00:48] You got taught how to act, how to carry yourself.
[00:00:54] The attitude you're supposed to have, you got turned into a frogman.
[00:01:02] Now there was no explicit course of instructions.
[00:01:08] No one's given classes on mental toughness or anything like that,
[00:01:12] but you were indoctrinated in other ways.
[00:01:18] You were taught the old ways.
[00:01:21] The old ways.
[00:01:23] Then you heard stories and you'd read stories about the NCDUs,
[00:01:28] the Naval Combat Demolition Units and the underwater demolition teams you hear about their incredibly brave work in World War II.
[00:01:37] You hear about the massive casualties that they would suffer,
[00:01:42] making the beaches safe for amphibious landings.
[00:01:46] And that frogman heritage certainly ran deep.
[00:01:55] But at its core, the lineage that we followed that we emulated and that we worshipped as young seals was the Vietnam seals.
[00:02:13] They were the standard without question.
[00:02:21] And I was lucky because when I got to the teams, there were still some Vietnam seals around.
[00:02:28] Some of them were on active duty.
[00:02:30] They were at the teams.
[00:02:32] They were in training departments or master chiefs or war officers or some of them were senior officers.
[00:02:37] Matter of fact, the Admiral and charge of the community when I got him was a Vietnam guy.
[00:02:40] But there weren't that many.
[00:02:43] And when they spoke, we listened and when they taught us something, we took notes.
[00:02:49] And they taught us the things that we needed to know, the tactics, the techniques, the immediate action drills, the standard operating procedures.
[00:02:58] And they also kept us honest because this is the 80s and this is the 90s and there's no war going on.
[00:03:04] And there was some flare ups around the globe and seals got some flashes of combat action, but there was no sustained operations.
[00:03:16] And we could have slapped off.
[00:03:20] But the old breed knew.
[00:03:23] They knew that it was only a matter of time before war would come again.
[00:03:28] And they wanted us to be ready.
[00:03:33] And when the time came, they were ready and we were ready because of them.
[00:03:38] Because of those Vietnam era seals that had continued to serve and continue to pass on the lessons and the knowledge to the younger generations.
[00:03:48] And because of them, we were ready to take the fight to the enemy.
[00:03:53] And we did.
[00:03:54] Like our forefathers, that's what we did.
[00:04:01] And it is an absolute honor today to have one of the longest serving seals.
[00:04:08] Clocking in at 47 years.
[00:04:12] The last Vietnam seal to be on active duty.
[00:04:16] And he's here with us tonight. Master Chief.
[00:04:19] Kirby Hurrell.
[00:04:21] Master Chief.
[00:04:22] This is your one thanks for coming on man.
[00:04:24] Hello guys. How you doing?
[00:04:26] I'm honored to be here and honored to to talk to all of your supporting people out there.
[00:04:33] And let them know what my story is and what a great story it is and what a wonderful life I've had.
[00:04:41] As I told the vice president the other day, I said, you know, I'd still be doing this job.
[00:04:47] If I wouldn't have got old.
[00:04:48] So that's the only drawback man. We all get old. It's the John Wayne theory. And if you know what that is.
[00:04:55] What's the John Wayne theory?
[00:04:56] None of us get out of here alive.
[00:04:59] That's the deal.
[00:05:01] But where do I start? Let me let me go.
[00:05:03] Let me go do you start. Let's start with wherever you grew up.
[00:05:06] I grew up in Missouri farm boy.
[00:05:08] Move to the big city.
[00:05:10] Start a building hot rods.
[00:05:12] Which big city?
[00:05:13] Say, Los.
[00:05:14] That's the only one in Missouri.
[00:05:15] They think other ones are but so much.
[00:05:19] So what year what year was this that you were moving to?
[00:05:23] Say Louis.
[00:05:25] Probably around 62 63.
[00:05:28] You know, and I, that's why I went to high school.
[00:05:31] Okay, so I was going to say, sir, you're in high school.
[00:05:33] Yeah, in high school at the time. And a COE was a big thing in those days where you go to high school in the morning.
[00:05:39] Get your math, arithmetic, English.
[00:05:41] And then you go work at noon time at a job site.
[00:05:45] And get a trade kind of something they're coming back to now because kids need trades.
[00:05:50] So I had a trade, but I worked at County Speedchap.
[00:05:53] So it fit perfect with my county.
[00:05:56] County Speedchap.
[00:05:58] It was a speedchap.
[00:06:00] The bill drag cars, build to track cars, everything else.
[00:06:04] And I had a 55 Chevy that I had built up had run.
[00:06:09] And the next one was a licker from dry counties to wet counties when I was living in Arkansas.
[00:06:15] It paid the bills. So that was good.
[00:06:18] And so when I got back to Missouri, I sort of built in bigger and faster motors.
[00:06:22] And I would take the car down and race for money down on the river flats, right.
[00:06:27] Well, I got caught one too many times.
[00:06:30] And the judge said, young man, I have some options for you.
[00:06:34] Well, I just finished reading the book Frog Man and I said,
[00:06:38] you know what, you're on her. I think that going to the Navy thing is going to be a good deal.
[00:06:42] So he said, here's my number. If your recruiter doesn't call me tomorrow,
[00:06:47] I'm putting a bench warrant out for you. So I went to sign up for the Navy the next morning.
[00:06:54] Was on an airplane that evening headed for San Diego and the change of my life, right?
[00:06:59] This is what kids think it's going to be like nowadays and it's not like that anymore.
[00:07:03] No, it's not like that. Matter of fact, if you get in trouble, you're not getting in the Navy.
[00:07:06] You damn shouldn't get in the sealed teams. If you have any kind of record, they don't want you.
[00:07:09] Absolutely. The other thing that happens is guys think, oh, I'm just going to join and then I'll be going the next day.
[00:07:13] It's like, no, you're going to have six months, eight months of waiting around before you go.
[00:07:17] Completely different world. And you got to remember the Vietnam War was.
[00:07:20] So it's way, really? I was 18 when that happened.
[00:07:24] And how close attention were you paying to Vietnam at the time?
[00:07:28] Not really a lot. I was paying more attention to hot rods and building fast cars.
[00:07:34] You know? And then when this thing came up and I had to kind of shift gears,
[00:07:40] realized that I was in the Navy now.
[00:07:42] This is 1967.
[00:07:44] 67. So Vietnam's full. I mean, Vietnam's on right now.
[00:07:48] It's on. It's going. So the, I got out here and went to boot camp at NTC here in San Diego.
[00:07:54] And in those days, you had to go do a ship tour or a Westpack tour before you could come to the teams.
[00:08:00] Oh. It wasn't coming right out of boot camp and going to butts, right? So I had to do a Westpack.
[00:08:07] And, you know, my job on the Westpack was a farmman because I happened to be the shortest guy
[00:08:12] and could crawl inside the boilers. And I went, wow, what a good deal.
[00:08:16] What's your way back then?
[00:08:18] Oh, probably about 130. Yeah, 130. I strong as bull, right? I could do 30 pull ups and not even
[00:08:26] bad and I and I'll tell you how that worked out for me when I was a training.
[00:08:30] So then the, so I was on the ship and the, the cool part about it is I didn't stay in the fire room
[00:08:38] a long time because the people that were taking care of the captain's gig did know how to set the
[00:08:43] rack on a slant six Detroit diesel. Check. I knew I was set that. So they got me out of the fire room
[00:08:51] to come up and be the captain's gig. So, uh, engineer. So that was a good deal. So you need one,
[00:08:57] E2, E2 at the time. Yeah, yeah, big man. Big, big, big, great, big, great. So it's very cool. I got the job.
[00:09:05] The boat was running great. The first day, uh, the job, right? And I was on the USS Peedmont.
[00:09:11] You had to run out on the big booms that that swing out from the ship. So they tie up all the
[00:09:16] captain's gigs and the mall of the officers motor boats and stuff like that. Well, the first day,
[00:09:21] I just had taken my white tennis shoes out of the washer. They were still pretty slippery. I'm running
[00:09:27] out on the boom, slip to a back flip from about 30 feet in the air into the water. Swim over,
[00:09:35] jump on the captain's gig and stand in where the engineer stands all the time and and captain
[00:09:41] Davies, who was the, was also a shard captain. He starts a plot and the quarter deck. He goes,
[00:09:46] geez, that was the best man. So needless to say, homin' I became great friends, great friends.
[00:09:54] And, uh, and that lasted for six months. And then when I got back, I did my, um, my bud's
[00:10:01] training, um, qualifications over in the PI. Did those over the PI when I got back to San Diego.
[00:10:08] I was expecting to go right to class, right? Not the case. Because my lieutenant had hidden the
[00:10:14] shit that I pushed through. And I, fortunately, I knew the captain. So captain Davies kind of made
[00:10:20] that all right. But I still ran from 30 seconds straight over to bud's training many times trying to
[00:10:26] get all that started out. It was just good training. But, um, then I got over to the training.
[00:10:32] And a captain, Adi, who's over there, goes, man, you just made it just in time to start class 40
[00:10:38] and I. Right. Well, all the pre-training that we have nowadays that kind of prepare you for all that
[00:10:43] stuff. And wasn't there. So like three days in the training, my legs are like ready to fall off.
[00:10:49] And so was everybody else's, right? Class 49 started. So how many, so what you checked in on
[00:10:54] what day, like how, how was it, how long was before you actually classed up and went? Like I
[00:10:59] started on, I, I, I got there on a Thursday. But we started training on a Monday. Okay. So that,
[00:11:06] that was the pre-training I got. Get your head. Get your head. Get your head. Yeah, yeah, that was the
[00:11:12] whole thing, man. So it was very cool, a very cool, all of it. And all this stem from the fact that you had
[00:11:17] read the book, the frogman. Oh, absolutely. And you said, that's what I wanted to do. Yeah, yeah, that's the
[00:11:21] exact. Were you a water guy? Did you? And not really the lakes or anything? Not really. First time I was
[00:11:26] in the ocean was here in San Diego. And I had a couple of surfers guys that were in the class,
[00:11:31] because I was trying to jump over the waves, because the only swim and I had to have been down as
[00:11:34] rivers and lakes, right? And was okay with that. But I hadn't dealt with surf before. And the surfers
[00:11:41] in the classical, no curvy, you got to dive underneath the waves. And I'm like, oh, shit, okay,
[00:11:47] got it. So underneath the waves I went, and it was great, man. I think once I got my fins,
[00:11:53] I felt like, you know, I was a water baby then, because I could fly with the fins. I never
[00:11:58] go near the ocean without my fins anymore, anyway. So it was very cool. So we got a
[00:12:04] so we got started. I mean, there was 220, 25 of us at starting class 49. And my
[00:12:11] nimicis was was Oliver and this came out of my retirement, right? Oliver was this big hook
[00:12:17] nose Indian guy that ran like a hundred miles and he was strong as an ox and ugly as an ace.
[00:12:22] Was an instructor? Was he a, another student? Total instructor. Got it. Total instructor,
[00:12:26] him and mother Moe. Mother Moe was also an instructor. Our class 49 was mother Moe's first class,
[00:12:32] right? So we're all standing out in front, you know, of the of the building over on the old
[00:12:37] amphibies. And we're all lined up there. Well, Oliver comes out and starts looking up and down
[00:12:43] the line and he goes, say, you're too sharp to be here. And I went, I'll be here when you're gone.
[00:12:52] Dave. Oh, that hurt. I ate half the mud in the bottom of San Diego, Dave, man. It was wild.
[00:12:59] But Oliver and I, we had, we grew a relationship while I was going through training. So being the
[00:13:05] shortest guy that everyone went through butch training, right? I felt all the five four. All the
[00:13:13] some days. Other days, I'm five three. Now that I'm getting older, I'm probably going to push
[00:13:18] five two pretty soon. But he had some more stories about that. But so the, so Oliver walks in the
[00:13:27] back of the, of the main office and tells Mother Moe, hey, Mother Moe, I think you got a troll in this class.
[00:13:35] And Mother Moe goes, tell her, shit me goes, we'll go out there and look. And there I was, man,
[00:13:41] it was wild. That, that started the whole cascade of of situations, right? So you talked shit to an
[00:13:49] instructor. That's, oh, yeah. I just want to advise people that could go, okay, it could also go
[00:13:54] terribly wrong. Oh, because if you piss off an instructor, they will, they will, they can crush you
[00:13:59] and destroy you. So that's, obviously saw something in you that he liked. Right. But if you want to
[00:14:04] see that, you know, they'll eat you alive. Well, I, I can only tell you that every day of training,
[00:14:09] every day of training, I was in the Goonsquad. So, so that may have been part of that, what you're
[00:14:16] saying, he didn't like me kind of thing, because no matter where I was at, if I was running in the
[00:14:20] middle of the pack, everybody from me back was in the Goonsquad. I was, I was the cut off. I could,
[00:14:27] one day, we just said, okay, I'm going to run in front of the pack, right? And everybody in the
[00:14:32] class goes, okay, that's great, because we'd wittled the class now a lot. So I was in the front of the
[00:14:36] pack, no shit. The whole class was in the Goonsquad. Oliver, he was great. He was a hard hard man,
[00:14:45] but, and I'll tell you, the, and it goes back to what I was saying earlier about pull-ups. We do
[00:14:50] PT and I could, I could run hard, do a lot of PT. And I, what it came to pull-ups, I could knock
[00:14:56] out 30 pull-ups with nothing flat. Well, Mother Moe and Oliver, I used to make me hang on the pull-up
[00:15:02] bar, and that hit me in the stomach and see how high they could make the swing. And I could,
[00:15:08] man, everybody in the class will tell you that my tharn, my tharn was in my class, you'll tell
[00:15:13] you that. You know, so some of the other, some of the other tidbits about going through training,
[00:15:17] Mike, Mike Thorton, because the dirty name is built for big guys, tall guys, because I'm short,
[00:15:22] I got a big chest, the top log on the dirty name. I couldn't get over sometimes. I just would
[00:15:28] couldn't do it. Well, Mike Thorton would come up there and throw me over the top log. And the
[00:15:33] instructors would get pissed off and go, sorry, and you stopped doing that. Where would he stand?
[00:15:37] What do you do that? What do you stand? Stand on the log, you know? He stands on the Lord log
[00:15:41] and throw me over the top log. It was great. And the day I couldn't do it, the instructors
[00:15:47] made me go through the weaver twice. But all the rest, no problem with any of the rest of the obstacles,
[00:15:54] but that was part of it. You know, in the personality, I think my personality kept me going,
[00:15:58] because it was a good thing in the instructors, even though I was pissing them off, they enjoyed having
[00:16:03] me there, because when it came to being, you know, making sand cookies and volcanoes and stuff,
[00:16:09] well, if they got too close, they became part of the sugar cookie in the volcano. And they're
[00:16:14] gone to hell, we hate you. So it was very cool. All of our bottom-y mistake after after graduation,
[00:16:22] so that must have meant something. Right? And, and mother-in-law, today, one of my best friends,
[00:16:29] you know, he comes to every event. He was at the, at my retirement, you know, when I retired,
[00:16:35] from the Navy, I had, I had like five speakers that all came up and shared their, their comments
[00:16:44] about Kirby as he went through training. And mother-in-law was one of them. So it was classic
[00:16:48] 1500 people, or my retirement. Yeah, yeah, huge, huge. But anyway, after after we got through
[00:16:54] buds, you know, then we went through, mom, we went to SBA. How many guys made it through?
[00:17:00] Yeah, in our class, there were 22. So you started with 220 and you ended with 20. Yeah, probably 10%.
[00:17:06] But I got roll back into class 50, same kind of thing. That's where I was. You get rolled for.
[00:17:12] Because there was a chief, chief rose, who was one of our instructors. Good guy,
[00:17:18] but he had come up with this little thing called the little Olympics where you had to do the,
[00:17:23] all these different exercises. Like swim, you had to swim 500 yards in your clothes, you had to
[00:17:28] push up setups, pull ups, and run a half mile a half in your clothes. And you had to do that all
[00:17:34] in a thousand seconds, right? So I missed it by like 12 seconds. And he goes, sorry, we're going to
[00:17:43] have to roll you back. And I went, oh, crap. Well, I wasn't only when there were like five guys in
[00:17:49] the class. I got rolled back. How far along were you in training? Well, we went through second phase.
[00:17:52] We had to go through second phase, die phase again, and then go into the third phase. But, you know,
[00:17:57] third phase to me was, you know, that was like a vacation because his land warfare, because it
[00:18:01] reached him, great shot. I'm good on the land. Because I was a hunter. And, you know, ours is a
[00:18:06] country boy. So I knew about all that stuff. And Mike Martin was in your Buds class as well.
[00:18:11] Yeah, class 50 rolled back in. You rolled into his class. Yeah, yeah. And then Mike Thornton,
[00:18:15] Mike Martin. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's good. I know what I thought about that before from one
[00:18:19] Mike to the other. And Mike, Mike and I were swim buddies. I mean, we did all the dives together,
[00:18:24] everything else. He was a hood when it came to doing ocean dives because he'd always get above me.
[00:18:30] And I couldn't, you know, when you're diving, you're looking for your swim buddy to the sides,
[00:18:34] right? Not above you. And Mike would screw with me all the time and hide up there in the
[00:18:39] kelp. And I go, I just lost my swim buddy. Where the hell is he? Right? But that was when we're out in
[00:18:44] the point Loma. Well, you guys diving the Emerson rig? Oh, absolutely. You mean,
[00:18:49] yeah, the one that that bubbled the way everything. Yes. Yeah, I don't know. I've only heard
[00:18:54] they call the green death. Yes. Yes. That's good. It's not a good rig. Well, because all of the
[00:18:59] bags, either bags that they had on it were built to keep, you know, the air, but because of your
[00:19:07] rubbing on things and operating and everything else, that always get a wear pattern at them.
[00:19:12] So you're always off-gassing in those bags. So you always had the charge. And if you didn't
[00:19:17] make sure your bags were charged, that's why they called it the green death. So yeah, we, we,
[00:19:24] we, we dove those a lot a lot. But, but we made it. We made it through. And then we all went to
[00:19:31] San Clemente Island, which was another hoot and had a great great time out of San Clemente Island,
[00:19:36] blown up stuff, shoot and stuff. I mean, you know, it's a dream. It's a dream. It's a dream.
[00:19:40] Yeah, total dream. Coming across the beach at night, you know, it was, uh, it was definitely
[00:19:45] definitely a good thing. And then, and once we graduated, but our graduations in those days were
[00:19:51] certainly not what the graduations are today. We were out behind building 401 and they came
[00:19:58] behind and gave us our certificates and goes, congratulations, you guys. You know, we all fell
[00:20:03] 10 foot tall because we graduated buds. But at the same time, there was no crowds. There had no
[00:20:08] nothing. It was just us. So different. And you, how did you not go to a UDT team?
[00:20:16] I was great at Land Warfare and I was a great shot. So they kind of, that's the way it worked
[00:20:21] in those days. If you were a good swimmer, if you were a real good swimmer, and you were kind of
[00:20:28] trinited towards that, then you would go to UDT. If you were good at Land Warfare, good at blowing
[00:20:34] up things and shooting, then you would go to Seal Team. And that's how I got picked to go to Seal Team
[00:20:39] 1 because I was much better on land than I was in the water. So that was the, um, that's what
[00:20:45] brought us over there. Mike and I went there. We went through SPI together. And now when you get to SPI,
[00:20:51] now there's just one Seal Team on the coast. So obviously Seal Team 1's running the SPI,
[00:20:55] which is the training to get you, the actual, the actual skills to be a seal because in buds,
[00:21:02] you don't learn a lot of things. And who's running that? The cadre. The cadre. I mean,
[00:21:09] we had, um, Moky Martin, you know, uh, and he was there and we had a number of other
[00:21:16] excellent guys that were had been to Vietnam several times. They were our instructors. The, um,
[00:21:22] and they took us out to our famous location as Nyland. You know, when there was nothing there,
[00:21:28] we lived in, uh, we had trailers that all the streams, uh, silver stream trailers, stream trailers.
[00:21:36] That's what we lived in. When no, no windows, it was 120 degrees. You know, we get up every morning
[00:21:42] and have our protein breakfast, which was fruit cocktail out of a can because there was nobody
[00:21:47] cooking anything. And then we, and then we'd go work in the desert all day and come back in that
[00:21:53] heat and then we'd have, uh, we'd have dinner, which was fruit cocktail in the can and kipersnack,
[00:21:59] which was another good deal. And then they had the, um, then they had the irrigation ditches up
[00:22:07] in the desert where they'd irrigate all the fields. Well, that was our shower. Because we didn't
[00:22:12] have any running water. So we would fill our, we would fill our canteens up to go train and in the desert
[00:22:19] at the filling station in town and off we'd go. That was the, uh, but we had a lot of bullets and that's
[00:22:25] all that mattered. Bullets, but the heat was unbearable. I mean, it's unbearable. 120 degrees. So I got
[00:22:30] it already, basically, for Vietnam. Because when we got the Vietnam, it was kind of like,
[00:22:35] yeah, this place is cold. But so SBI, how long was SBI? SBI was like six weeks. Okay. Six weeks.
[00:22:45] And, and that got us up the speed and then they got us into our batones and then now. And so what
[00:22:50] year was this now? This was 1969. 1969. Yeah. And what opportunity did you go into at Seal Team 1?
[00:22:57] At, uh, Fox Trapperton. Fox, I was a point man of Fox Trapperton. Squad one and Mikey was
[00:23:04] a point man of squad two. Mikey Thornton or Mike Martin. Mike Martin. Mike Martin. You're right.
[00:23:08] Mike Martin. I mean, Mike Thornton had already been over with another. He's using class 49.
[00:23:13] Class 49. Yeah. And because then we were kind of six weeks behind those guys, that's why we rolled.
[00:23:19] But there was no, we didn't have the time lag they have today about going to war. When you
[00:23:24] finish SBI, you were going right now. So I remember the day when they go, okay, you guys are
[00:23:29] deploying and we went over to North Island Air Station. Did you do any kind of work up as
[00:23:34] you're put as a pertune? A couple weeks, you know, couple. So you finished SBI. Yeah. And then it's
[00:23:41] into a pertune. You spend a few weeks into a, in the pertune and then off off your wall. I guess there
[00:23:46] wasn't really because there's so many less seals. It wasn't only what on the west coast there
[00:23:51] was about 100 seals. 80 seals. Okay. So everybody's kind of uniformed anyways because you're all
[00:23:56] learning from the exact same cadre. That's right. And that's why when when I came back from Vietnam,
[00:24:02] that's why they put me right into training. So because we had new guys that had to be trained up.
[00:24:07] And there was no time to get that going. Right. So that's what they, that's what they were doing.
[00:24:12] The guys that were really good in the, in the field, they would take them and put them right in the
[00:24:16] to training department and get the guys that are ready to go into it and off they go. So
[00:24:21] long was it. So how long were you in your pertune? Do you in Foxhopton for like a couple
[00:24:27] months? Then you did this at all? You're going on the planet? Probably nine. We were, we were in
[00:24:31] there three months prior to deployment. And then we deploy would be over there six months and
[00:24:36] come back and then they'd break the pertune apart and off it goes. Was there any, I mean, was there any
[00:24:42] like this anti war stuff that we didn't even think about it? We were all way too busy to even think
[00:24:48] about that. I mean, we saw it when we got home, you know, because of the, because of the anti war stuff
[00:24:54] and all that kind of stuff. And you know, and we were too hardened to even carry it right,
[00:25:00] we didn't carry it. And so that we just kind of blew right past that we never got into anyone.
[00:25:06] I mean, when we got home there was kind of a demonstration outside of North Island, you know,
[00:25:12] about that kind of thing. We drove right by it. But so it was no, no big deal.
[00:25:16] So what was in your, so how old are you now right now? Are you like 19, 20 years old? Yes.
[00:25:21] So you're 20 years old. You're going on your first deployment to Vietnam. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:24] How turned 21 over? What was your, what was your thoughts flying over to Vietnam?
[00:25:29] Well, we had like a C 17, which was like a World War II plane that we were flying in.
[00:25:36] And it seemed like we flew forever. And you know, and then the cool thing about it is when you're
[00:25:41] left North Island, they give you a box lunch. Then when you landed in Hawaii, they gave you a box
[00:25:47] lunch. Well, the, you know, the box lunch was like an egg, an orange. You had a peanut butter
[00:25:53] and jelly sandwich and an amitan cheese sandwich and some milk. So that was your box lunch.
[00:26:00] And, and off you went, man, we went in high style, you know, and we landed at Thompson
[00:26:05] New Airport. We landed there and they, we hung out there for a while and then the, even before
[00:26:13] we had to fly from Thompson, Newt, down to Ben Tui because our, the special operations office or
[00:26:18] Seal team office was at Ben Tui. So we flew into there. I flew into there because I was like the
[00:26:25] part of the pre-party to go to Seafloon and start setting up for the new Patoon and run the first
[00:26:30] ops stuff with the, with the old Patoon and stuff like that. So that was, we flew from there.
[00:26:36] There was a guy's stayed in the Victoria Hotel, you know, in in Saigon at the time and we
[00:26:42] took off and flew down to Ben Tui. Got ready to catch a bird and go on down to Seafloon.
[00:26:48] And were you pretty much just completely amped to go and get some?
[00:26:50] Oh, absolutely. We all are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's who we are, right?
[00:26:56] Yeah. We wanted to get with it. We wanted to get with the program and get there as soon as possible.
[00:27:01] We did our break and up. You know, we, what about older guys that were on their, who, who and
[00:27:05] your Patoon had been on like three, four, five deployments already? Well, the chief that we had,
[00:27:11] chief Jones had been on it. He'd been on a couple of deployments. My radioman, Lee Pippman,
[00:27:17] who had been there. We had another guy, Al Jatsu, as our Rishikiradi guy, you know, and they're
[00:27:23] all good guys. All good guys. And what was their attitude like going back?
[00:27:27] Hey, let's rock. Let's rock. Yeah. Let's rock. So legit. Lee Pippman was my, was, was the best. He was
[00:27:35] the best radioman you could ever want, right? He was in their collinum and just, hey, get over here.
[00:27:40] You know, but they were all, you know, I think, I think probably the biggest guy, the gunshot,
[00:27:45] I won was the chief. He, he just had seen a lot of war. And I don't think that he really,
[00:27:53] he knew he had to be there because he was the chief, right? But some of the shit that we got into,
[00:27:58] you know, he just, it was time for him to go home. Right? And so we did. We saw him,
[00:28:03] because the shit we got into man, I mean, one night, when we got ambushed on the damn
[00:28:09] guy, and Mike probably told you this, but we were going in and I, who had, I was going in on a sandpan.
[00:28:15] We had like four sandpads on the bow of the, of the seal light support craft. And I was asleep in the,
[00:28:22] in the sandpan, right? We hit this canal called the damn guy, something woke me up. I think it's
[00:28:28] a guy upstairs, you know, the Lord was going Kirby. It's time for you to wake up. So I woke up and I
[00:28:34] go holy shit. And I jump, I start to jump in the boat and a B-40 rocket blows the bow of the boat off.
[00:28:41] I roll and come up right behind right, I'm holding on to the 50 caliber machine gun. We're right
[00:28:48] in the middle of the kilzone of an ambush. Everything we learned, right? If you're in a kilzone
[00:28:54] blast your way out of it. So that 50 swung around and it just started blast it. And I had a
[00:29:00] couple of guys on the floor, which the chief was one of them. And they were link in that 50 cal,
[00:29:05] ammo and that 50 cal was going for everything it was worth man. People on the, on the banks,
[00:29:12] guys are shooting flares and every time I saw a guy that 50 cal were took amount. So it was like
[00:29:17] we were doing damage. But by then the first boat that Mike was on, Miss Mike Martin, they had
[00:29:24] called in the sea walls. So the sea walls were scrambling. Here are these guys come flying over
[00:29:30] miniguns, blaring the door gunners. So I've got their white BVDs on and black jackets. I never
[00:29:37] even took time to get dressed and they're blowing the shit out of this place over there, right? So
[00:29:42] by the time we got all that settled, the, the, the, I had had bullet holes through my clothes that had
[00:29:49] burned my skin, but no through and through. Everybody, the boat was, we had to scrap the boat because
[00:29:56] it had so many bullet holes and it was unbelievable. Mike's boat, the medium support had to
[00:30:02] tow a saline. Then we had to make a circle and come back out of the dam, do I hell of a firefight,
[00:30:07] hell of a firefight? One on for a long, long time. And when we got back to sea float, you know,
[00:30:14] the, the boat that I was in was almost right as sink, right? So it was, it was very well destroyed,
[00:30:20] but nobody got shot, nobody got killed. I got burn marks that was the biggest, that was the biggest
[00:30:25] deal. But the, that was a wild time and the, and the coxon whose name was Willy Willow Williams,
[00:30:33] that guy was, he was an older guy, right? And every time he had gone with this, he needed to
[00:30:38] take a shot of whiskey, just, just to keep himself safe. Take the edge off. And he was like a little,
[00:30:47] yeah, he was, that was one crazy night for Willy, but we all made it home safe, you know,
[00:30:53] I'm ready for the next day. So when you got there, what was the, what was the primary,
[00:30:57] what was the mission that you guys were tasked with doing, what were you guys doing? Well,
[00:31:00] we were, you know, when we got there, Admiral Zumwall had towed a bunch of barges up, right?
[00:31:06] 13 barges, we call it sea flow, you can go online and look at it. So a bunch of barges that supported
[00:31:13] all of the river reenboats and all of the air squadrons in South Vietnam. So it's set,
[00:31:20] they anchored it right in the middle of the San Kulan River with these giant anchors, right? So
[00:31:25] it was probably about, I don't know, 100 yards, you know, on each side of it, on the river banks
[00:31:31] until the tides, you know, went, when the tides changed over there because there were 14 foot
[00:31:36] tide change, then you'd have mud banks and stuff like that. So it worked out perfectly. The problem with it,
[00:31:43] and that's where we were all stationed. The problem with it was that the zappers would use the current
[00:31:48] and tie explosives on a line, let the explosives float down with the current and hook around your
[00:31:55] anchor chain. And then these explosives would come into the side of sea float and try to blow you up.
[00:32:00] So all of the guards that were posted 24, 7 at the thing would have to watch out for that and shoot it out.
[00:32:07] So in a million night when you're trying to get sleep and all of a sudden this big charge blows
[00:32:11] up and you go, oh, cool. Well, that one didn't get us. And so that was the, that was life on sea flow.
[00:32:18] I mean, every, every night where you're burning was and everything, everything, everything.
[00:32:23] Yeah, burning showers, food, everything. That's where our offices were at and all that kind of stuff.
[00:32:28] So it was, it was an experiment to do that. Very successful deployment on that thing.
[00:32:34] Yes. Well, except when I was working Phoenix program, if I was working Phoenix program,
[00:32:39] then I would go to different locations, right? But we usually would launch off of there.
[00:32:44] And some of the Phoenix stuff we would do were two man sandpan ops, where myself, Leon Roush,
[00:32:50] rest his soul. Him and I would get in a sandpan and take a KCS scout with us.
[00:32:56] And we had paddle 10 clicks into bad guy country and snatched the sky out of his hooch and
[00:33:01] bring him back because he's was a bad guy.
[00:33:04] Big high level VC. Yeah. High level VC. Where were that intel come from?
[00:33:08] From the kid Carson scouts from Navy intelligence, you know, from from a lot of different
[00:33:14] areas and we would bring it all in because we sent a lot. We did a lot of owner, our own intelligence
[00:33:19] gathering in the southern region down there. Explain the Phoenix program for people that don't know what it is.
[00:33:25] Well, the Phoenix program was designed by the agency and probably several other people.
[00:33:31] And what it was was to root out the bad guys in villages that were working kind of like double
[00:33:40] agents that were working for the South Vietnamese government, also working for the Viet Kong.
[00:33:45] So what we relied on, what this Phoenix program relied on was intel from the locals
[00:33:51] that this guy was a double agent and then when we got that, then we would send teams in to
[00:33:57] snatch the guy and bring him out and do further interrogation on. By not only us, but by other
[00:34:04] groups, you know, and that worked. It worked well until the bad guys started fingering good guys
[00:34:12] and now the intelligence was all mixed up. So, you know, in the beginning of it, it worked
[00:34:17] fantastic because we got a lot of bad guys, you know, basically out of the jungle. But then the bad guys.
[00:34:24] It's like psychological operations too, because these guys who thought that they were safe and thought
[00:34:28] they could get away with it all of a sudden they disappeared in the middle of the night. Absolutely.
[00:34:32] Absolutely. And put the fear of God into it. That's right. That's what the minute a green face
[00:34:36] is did was make them disappear. And you were running two man operations. Oh yeah.
[00:34:41] Getting a sandpan and you were paneled how far would you guys paddle? I think the
[00:34:47] feathers, the deepest we ever want was probably ten clicks from a safe zone. Would you care for
[00:34:55] radio? Where would you carry your radio? We carry regular radio, pre 25. Yeah, yeah. And I carried
[00:35:02] I carried a... But you're dressed like a Vietnamese guy. Absolutely. Black pajamas, you know,
[00:35:07] the hood is nighttime so they can't see that you're a white boy from Missouri. That's
[00:35:11] that's exactly right. That's exactly right. Probably the scariest opt is I tell everybody about
[00:35:16] this opt because Leon and I went on this opt and we captured this high level VC and we're patlin
[00:35:21] back on. So let's lift it. It's a good one. Let's talk about it. So this is Phoenix Program
[00:35:26] operation. Phoenix Program operation. And you get in tell on a bad guy. Right. They tell you,
[00:35:32] okay. Now, how detailed was the intelligence that's what you would get? Would they tell you, okay,
[00:35:36] here's the village? Would you get overhead imagery of that village? No, not in those days. So
[00:35:42] you just would look at a map. We would look at a map. We would talk with our KCS and the KCS
[00:35:47] were more kind of guys that we paid on our side to that new the local area because we had captured
[00:35:54] them but we had switched them over to our side. We were paying them. We also had a village with
[00:35:59] their family that we supported. Okay. And so we made sure that they weren't going to go to
[00:36:05] the other side because their family was visiting us. Right. So that was the whole thing. So they
[00:36:11] would help us decide exactly where this were at. And they were good guys and for the most part,
[00:36:17] they were wonderful. So operative. So you'd be looking at, you, okay, there's a village at this
[00:36:23] grid coordinate or whatever. You'd look at it. You'd do a map study looking at the river. And you think,
[00:36:28] okay, when this river turns to whatever, 280 degrees, then we have to go another 200 meters
[00:36:34] and the village will be on the left side of the lake. Absolutely. And then work the tides because
[00:36:38] remember the tides are 14 feet. So you've got to move with the tides. There's nothing moving against
[00:36:44] the tide. You can move it, herb. But you've got to move with the flow. Would you try and time it?
[00:36:49] So you were going in with the tide and coming out with the tide? Oh yeah. That was key.
[00:36:54] And if you didn't do that, you're kind of screwed. Yes. Well, you were very slow one way or the other.
[00:36:59] And then you're going into a little like this is just your stereotypical Vietnamese village.
[00:37:04] Oh, absolutely. So much a little huch is set up. And you would know, hey, third huch from the water
[00:37:10] on the right hand side. It's got to whatever, a freaking. That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
[00:37:15] That's how we would target it. And then, okay, so you go up, you paddle, you're tracking,
[00:37:22] are you using any night vision at all? No. Are you trying to do it with moon with half moon
[00:37:28] with starlight? Did you want to completely dark? What did you all always ideal? All the half moon
[00:37:32] would have been ideal. And that's what we would. But y'all, you don't always get that. So that was the
[00:37:38] whole thing. So that was a role of the dice sometimes depending on what the moon coverage was at,
[00:37:44] you know, and tides, you know, what was going. So you always had to work those two, especially
[00:37:48] with a two-man team, two-man team. You don't have a whole lot there. I mean, you got everybody
[00:37:52] on standby. What are you caring for a weapon? Stoner, man. Coming on. I didn't go anywhere without Betsy.
[00:37:59] She was she was with me all the time. She was a great equalizer. How many rounds would you carry?
[00:38:06] Thousand. And what, and what, like two canteens of water in a K bar in your good. Maybe some grenades.
[00:38:13] Maybe one canteen of water, a K bar, a medical kit, and four grenades. And I was good.
[00:38:21] That was my black pajama outfit. Yeah. And so a body armor, body armor was a t-shirt with a
[00:38:29] boot, bulls-eyed painted on it. And you're in black pajamas. And so you get, so you pat it up.
[00:38:37] And then you, do you just beat the boat? Yeah, coast right in. coast right in. It's quiet.
[00:38:43] Is there any other activity on the water at night? And if there is, is there another VC activity?
[00:38:48] Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I'll tell you a story about coming out of one of the villages where
[00:38:53] there were, you know, that mean they're moving the same way you're moving. They're moving with tides
[00:38:58] and everything else. If they're moving at night, are they VC? Yes. Okay. Yep. Only a people
[00:39:02] not there that were friendly were us. And the, and the, the philosophy goes. Everything on this
[00:39:10] hop, everything, everybody that's on this ops coming home safe, everything else is not. Right?
[00:39:16] So that's what it was. So we slid into a village one night. So we slide in, we take the people we
[00:39:21] want, knock them out, thome in the bottom. Would you do knock them out? Hit them with the hammer, hit them
[00:39:26] with the, whatever. Just standard operating procedure. Carry the slapper, you know? The slapper
[00:39:32] always works. Slapper on the jaw, you'll knock it, guys. You can't even suppress weapons?
[00:39:38] I did 22. That's all we had in those days. We didn't have any good.
[00:39:42] The last puppies. Yeah. And we did those mostly far dogs that were in geese that were, you know,
[00:39:48] that were put out there to act as shooting headshot on a geese. That's impressive. Well, yeah,
[00:39:54] it had this. But you usually shot him in the fat body. With the 22 with the 22 long, they go
[00:40:02] what was that? But the, but the stoner one night were coming out. We met some VC going in. We were
[00:40:13] just kind of laying out, waiting for the tide to change. And we were laying in the weeds, right?
[00:40:19] And a VC, Sampan came by and I put my stoner up. I had my stoner pointed it in, follow her on
[00:40:27] the sandpan. And he reaches out to knock all the weeds away and touches the coal steel. Well,
[00:40:35] his eyes were very big at that moment. But they weren't big for very long. So we eliminated
[00:40:42] those boys and kept on moving. Yeah. It's a once you get in a contact like that. Now,
[00:40:48] everybody knows you're there. Everybody's scrambled. Everything. Everything gets scrambled.
[00:40:52] Everything. Okay. So now you're scrambling the sea wolfs. Absolutely. And they come out at night
[00:40:57] to try and help you. Oh, yeah. We had a guy from, we had Dennis Rally on here from the US,
[00:41:02] a C wolf pilot. And he just was just awesome. Oh, awesome talking to him. They didn't care about anything.
[00:41:08] Oh, they were going. They were going. If you guys called them, they were going 100% they were
[00:41:12] going. They were full on. And if you haven't seen their new video, they got to see it. We put
[00:41:18] out the word scrambles. He was. Yes, scrambles. He was, you got to do it. It's a great, great film.
[00:41:23] Man talks about those guys and you can't say enough about those guys. They're coming out to our
[00:41:28] our Vietnam, you know, parties get together. That we have because they were so vital to our survival.
[00:41:35] You know, they saved our ass. Way more than we can even count. Yeah. Crazy. He told the story.
[00:41:43] They were, they stayed on station so long. He goes, look, we're going to run a fuel. Oh, well,
[00:41:49] they run out of fuel. They land in the middle of a pet rice paddy. Yep. And they're using ammo cans to
[00:41:55] transport fuel for one. No, they were all garage mechanics. Those guys were unbelievable. I mean,
[00:42:04] I was a hotrod mechanic. So I understood the mechanism. But what they did to get those birds
[00:42:11] airborne in the beginning was phenomenal. I mean, they took pieces and parts and pieces and parts
[00:42:16] and did it. And to see them do that and then, you know, as the war carried on, people at the army
[00:42:23] actually started copying what they were doing. They're going, how come those guys do that? We can't
[00:42:28] do that. Right? So now there's many guns on way more aircraft than they ever had before. And that was
[00:42:34] because the sea wolves were the ones that started it. And they put their rocket pods on there. I mean,
[00:42:39] hey, man, you know, it was all good. It was all good. So you you whack this VC that touches the barrel
[00:42:47] of your weapon in the genre. Yeah, yeah. You kill him now it's on. It's on because it's been completely
[00:42:55] silent the whole night. Hold the whole night. And all of a sudden, there's a burst of 5, 5, 6 rounds
[00:43:02] and now everyone's awake. So now you get on the radio? Okay. And you gotta go, hey, we just
[00:43:06] were in contact. The VC that our our KCS is paddling like a wild man. Leon is on the radio.
[00:43:14] And I got the stoner out of the front of the of the sandpan. We're going. How far, how far away are
[00:43:21] you from? We were picked up. We were probably like three, four clicks inside VC country. So that's
[00:43:28] how we had to go 4,000 yards to get off. I mean, everybody knew where we were at. So the launch was good.
[00:43:35] It was hairy to say this. The good thing is they don't have night vision. That was a good thing.
[00:43:39] How we didn't have night vision. Yeah, but I mean at that point, I'd take that trade because
[00:43:44] I don't want them to have night vision on a river. It's a night. It's scary. Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
[00:43:48] I've been on the river. It's like, you know, combat zone. You feel real naked at all. If the
[00:43:53] enemy possibly has night vision, even they don't have night vision. Well, you're running on the
[00:43:56] moon. Your whole and your whole and instinctive reaction is heightened. Right. The hair on the back
[00:44:02] of your neck, everything's going. Right. Because you know, they are feeling exactly the same thing.
[00:44:07] You're feeling like they're going holy shit, man. Where's this person at? Because they don't
[00:44:11] know exactly where you're at. All they heard was a burst. So they're coming in their carousness
[00:44:16] and you're moving as fast as you can. Right. So that was the whole thing. We knock on wood. The
[00:44:22] Lord was with this that night and we got home safe. Right. And so what's your, what's your extra
[00:44:27] point? Do you get, do you meet it? Uh, in a main canal, the main canal. The main canal. And there's,
[00:44:32] there's a boat of some kind. Yeah. Yeah. What kind of boats were you guys using? The MSC. We had
[00:44:36] Light Seal Support Craft, which was the one that we got ambushed in. We had medium seal support
[00:44:40] craft, which were aluminum boats that had a step on the back of them had two twin, four 27
[00:44:48] Chevy motors and them with holly carburetors. We, I put the holly carburetors on them. So, and these
[00:44:54] things, I mean, they were fast and they would do 50 miles an hour plus on those river. So,
[00:44:59] if once you got on step, get out the way, there wasn't anything stopping. And then we had swift
[00:45:04] boats and we had PBRs. Then we had the big junks that were down at sea, floating everything out.
[00:45:08] So, there was, there was more than enough coverage to pick us up once we were on the big river.
[00:45:15] So, your paddle and out, do you stay close to the edge of the river? Oh, yeah. So, you're in the
[00:45:19] dark? Oh, sure. Shadow is. So, you're trying to stay in the shadows? Don't get, yeah, don't get in
[00:45:24] hurry when and rush something, right? Take your time. I mean, you just, you had a burst.
[00:45:30] Nobody knows what that was, but they know there's something, right? There's there's not.
[00:45:36] And if you had a one burst, it's hard for them to even triangulate by sound where it was.
[00:45:41] Yes, totally. Is that true in the jungle too? Like in the city,
[00:45:44] you, you, you, you's hard to really hard to tell where a, one burst, it'd be hard to tell where it came from.
[00:45:49] Same. Same. Because you, you have the same situation. That sound is bouncing off of everything.
[00:45:54] So, you know, that's why they have, they've invented the, when we're over in Bosnia,
[00:46:00] you know, the Brits had the triangulation thing. When a mortar would go off, they would
[00:46:05] contrangulate right where the noise was at. Yeah. And then we could drop stuff right on that.
[00:46:09] That was an excellent thing. We didn't have that in Vietnam. We're kind of going. I think it's over there.
[00:46:13] Yeah, yeah. Mel, maybe over there. Right? And as soon as you, I mean, you scramble out of the
[00:46:18] immediate area, but you get 200 meters away and then it's like, okay, let's get quiet.
[00:46:23] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Same thing. Same thing as you do as an insertion. Right?
[00:46:27] You move off that noisy spot. You move in. You set your weight. Is anything moving? Is anything
[00:46:34] coming at us? No, it's not. Okay. Let's move. Right. Get going. That's where the word black came from.
[00:46:40] When you go black. Go black. I came from guess who? That was a Vietnam thing. Go black.
[00:46:47] Nobody knows what that word means only you. Right? So when you're all the shit going,
[00:46:53] everything else is going, go black. Boom. Now what is everybody? Nobody knows where it's all coming
[00:46:59] from. They get suspected, but they don't know. And are they brave enough to stick their face
[00:47:04] out there to find out? Not really. So that was that was that was one of many. I mean, yeah.
[00:47:11] So is that the op? I cut you off and then we kind of ran off in another source. That the one you said,
[00:47:16] this is a story I always tell. It was Phoenix program. It was in a village. Oh, one of many. Okay.
[00:47:22] Yeah, one of them. So that's the one where you had that guy. You got that contact. Well, we went
[00:47:26] range. And then I'll go to another one that was down south when we insert it because we had some
[00:47:33] VC. We had intelligence. The VC was coming up south. We had done all the sensor planning to
[00:47:40] in the jungles to make sure we could pick up movement in the jungles and stuff like that. And
[00:47:44] we got movement way down deep. But we had to go in and set to so how awful the tune of Fox
[00:47:51] Trot. We went down to set up on a river that we thought they were going to become an across. So
[00:47:58] we moved in late in the evening. So you're setting up an ambush or setting up an ambush on a river
[00:48:03] on a river. And this is straight up the same thing that you guys taught us. Yeah, it's a
[00:48:09] same thing. Play more. It's a same thing. It's an ex-absolutely the same thing. Play more is on each
[00:48:17] flank. Play more in the rear. Let's watch. See what happens. So I'm on the left flank. Right. I
[00:48:23] run my clay more out. Come back in. I'm setting. Right. And all of a sudden I hear movement. Right.
[00:48:28] So I'm watching the tides. The tides are going down. And I see this bridge start bubbling up from
[00:48:39] the water. So they have a hidden bridge in it. So I see that the only saving graces were on high ground.
[00:48:46] They're on low ground. I see all these guys. There's like 80 guys down there that are trying to come
[00:48:52] across that bridge to do a ambush on sea float on the Sun Kulin River. So I let the first guy.
[00:48:59] Right. I tell the oh get the black ponies and the sea wolves in there. So he scrambles those guys.
[00:49:08] Right. So this guy comes walking across and it's a point out when it comes right. What's the range from
[00:49:14] you? Probably when I initiate probably five feet. So so he's got to walk up like this up the bridge.
[00:49:25] Right. Well I'm right here. So the hillstone or it comes over and I go,
[00:49:29] and we light them up. Right. Turn eight. Boom. Boom. Light them up and overhead. OV10s. Right.
[00:49:40] And one of the pilots, let's slide here and tell. Come with me. We call them. We throw the
[00:49:46] we had a tear out, which was kind of the early stages of Kim Light Juice that we could throw
[00:49:53] in the water that marked our line. So we threw that in the water and marked our line and the OV10s
[00:50:00] come flying out of the sky. And they're coming from like 3,000 feet directly at the ground.
[00:50:06] Letting loose the zoomy rockets going. And they're getting kind of close. And I'm going
[00:50:13] blow the clay mors and get the hell out of here. So we're blowing the clay mors and we're getting
[00:50:19] the hell out of there. Right. And these guys are just tearing it up across the river. And so we're
[00:50:24] taking off and all of a sudden we hear this. He and I go, shit. What is that? Run. So so we're taking
[00:50:33] off. Well, what was was our Lieutenant had just pulled his lifejack just enough in the frenzy.
[00:50:40] Oh, where the CO2 cart was just. Was weeping? I'm going to get away from me. It's going
[00:50:45] to be a big blow. So we're all in the ass. We're all in the ass back up to Canal. It was what a
[00:50:51] night that was. Holy shit man. And then we sent down a group of arvins the next morning to check
[00:50:57] it out. And they there was like 80 dead bodies down there. So it was a while. So I'm off like that.
[00:51:03] What, what, how did you guys insert? We insert a boat up the river where the river started.
[00:51:08] I'll be able to remember how far we, how far away would you guys throw? Probably. Probably click.
[00:51:12] Okay, so pretty close. Yeah. And you're controlling. What do you wear it? You wear it? Are you wearing
[00:51:17] blue jeans? I didn't wear blue jeans at night. I did wear blue jeans. But that night I didn't
[00:51:22] wear blue jeans. How about how about barefoot? Oh, no. Oh, no. Jim Bird is the only one that does barefoot.
[00:51:32] Yeah, no, I wore my boots and I'm glad I wore my boots. Yeah, that that only seemed crazy to me. But I know
[00:51:38] there's guys that did it. Oh, man, I know. And I don't, guys, I did it too. But I, hey, when I'm moving,
[00:51:44] I'm moving way too fast. I worry about stepping on something. Right? Yeah, because it was, uh,
[00:51:49] that was a busy night. And so for a night like that, since you're not wearing the black
[00:51:53] pajamas, you're wearing web gear. You got your stoner. You're still carrying a thousand rounds.
[00:51:59] Thousands of rounds. Offensive operation. You're bringing more grenades?
[00:52:02] Oh, we would have probably, you know, in smoke. I mean, since I was a point man, I would have
[00:52:07] a carried whatever the red or the green smoke and the radio and usually carry the red smoke.
[00:52:12] If we need to mark something, if we need to mark an LCE, they would have it. Somebody else would
[00:52:15] have yellow and purple. You know, out through the, out through the squad. And then in the squad,
[00:52:20] how many sixties would you have in the squad? Uh, two. Two sixties. And then with the rear
[00:52:24] security be carrying a stoner, too. You bet. And nothing like far superior. Yeah. So anyway, what about
[00:52:32] would it be, so there would be two stoners in two sixties? Two stoners, two sixties. And sometimes
[00:52:37] three stoners and two sixties. The Lieutenant would carry M 16, right? A.O. I.C. would probably carry,
[00:52:45] and they would probably have, you know, M 79. M 79s are have a 203 underneath of it. Uh huh.
[00:52:52] You know, that's probably what would, would have went on. And were you guys in seven or eight
[00:52:57] men's mods? We were in eight. Yeah. Yeah. Eight eight eight men's mods. Right. So it was, yeah. That was,
[00:53:08] how long would you guys plan for these missions for? Oh, that's, you know, I mean, we had our own
[00:53:12] intel. So I mean, when we get something, we could put together an op in a couple hours and ready to go
[00:53:18] because, you know, just as, as every seal knows, you know, once the, you get there and you get the
[00:53:24] routine down, everybody knows what their job is. That's what makes us what we are. And so we can put
[00:53:29] together, not very, very quickly, you know, and, you know, just in, in Germany when I was working in
[00:53:35] Germany, you know, in plus two, that's what it meant, man. In plus two. When you get the call,
[00:53:41] you got two hours to get the airport, get on that airplane and get going. And that happened more
[00:53:45] than I want to. We can shift gears, but the, uh, that was, that was a Vietnam war. And then I came back
[00:53:52] and, uh, so we, what, just hold on the Vietnam war. How, what was your optempo like? Like how often
[00:53:57] were you guys working? We ran probably in that six month period of time, well over 100 opts.
[00:54:04] So, I mean, there were days when there would be three opts a day, you know, other days where there's
[00:54:11] two opts, one up. Did you do any of those parakeet opts flying in the daytime, like,
[00:54:15] just pouncing on a village or something? Sure. Sure. We did that, and I'll tell you a good story about
[00:54:21] that. We, we did one of those when, because I was appointment, I was a guy that hung out the door
[00:54:26] and located the village, right? Because we didn't have GPS in those days. So I was hanging out
[00:54:30] the door and I'd find the village where the bad guys were at and I'd tell the birds set down. So we're
[00:54:35] flying down this canal. I mean, we're doing every maneuver or following each bend in, in that canal.
[00:54:42] I'm hanging out the door and I go, that's the village right there. So we flares, we jump on, hit it.
[00:54:48] We're in a skirmish line. We start taking fire from the village, not long. Our close behind us
[00:54:55] are the sea walls. So we get in a skirmish line. We start moving on this village, right? And
[00:55:00] taking, taking all the bad guys down this village and we call in the sea walls. So the sea walls
[00:55:06] come in, probably 10 feet overhead with the minigods and chest start breaking the village, right?
[00:55:12] Needless to say, we looked like a wildman running at the village and that was because all the
[00:55:20] hot brass coming out of the minigods were going down the back of our necks and we were going,
[00:55:25] help us. So I was going to kill anybody that was in front of me. I didn't care who
[00:55:31] I was. We all got back, we all got back to sea float and all of us had like 20 bird marks on
[00:55:37] our back where the hot brass had fallen out of that minigun I went. That's probably the last time I'm
[00:55:42] going to do that. But it wasn't, but it worked out that worked out fantastic and that was like
[00:55:48] the same what you're calling periquita. Absolutely. Any kind of ops, stay behind ambushes all
[00:55:54] that kind of stuff. We did all that. We incorporated all that in our tactics. How often would you
[00:55:59] guys get contact with the enemy on an ops? If you did 100 operations, how often would you guys
[00:56:04] get contact with the enemy? You don't, I want to say 70% of the time because we did most of our
[00:56:11] own intelligence. So we were always involved in contact. There were a few times where we walked and
[00:56:20] walked and dry whole. Dry whole. It wasn't where it was supposed to be. But the majority of the
[00:56:27] time we had contact, which was, which kept us all jazzed and ready to go pumped. That was the whole
[00:56:36] thing. But a capet reel because we were all, we knew when we'd go out, we were going to have contact.
[00:56:41] So you better have your shit in one bag. How did you guys do for taking casualties?
[00:56:48] Well, you know, everybody in Foxhopatoon except for one of our officers who,
[00:56:56] I have to laugh because Mike Martin pointed out a booby trap to him and he turned around to tell somebody
[00:57:02] about the booby trap and walked into the booby trap and it put some babies in his butt. So he was a
[00:57:09] casualty. So we had to fly him back to a sea float and get the holes in his ass patched up. But
[00:57:17] other than that, everybody, I think, I mean, we all got hit. But nobody got hit so badly that they had to
[00:57:25] they had to be met a vact off. Now our group when we were there is when we had the biggest loss
[00:57:31] of life in Vietnam when the Hilo went down that we lost five guys. We got off of that bird and that
[00:57:38] bird, that operation was an operation that we had just come off of because we had we went after a
[00:57:45] Russian advisor to the, to the Vietcong. We had him in a village. He was able to run out of that
[00:57:54] village and run into the forest. That was at the end of a rice paddy. So we decided to go after that.
[00:58:03] But going after that, we got met with like 500 VC because they had a whole company size element
[00:58:11] down there. So we kind of got it handed to us in a bit. But nobody, nobody lost their lives. We were able
[00:58:17] to get back to get back, break contact, get on our birds and get home. But the bird took some
[00:58:23] hits. Right. So when landed at C-flow, we told them shut it down. Let's take a look at it. The army
[00:58:30] pilots said, no, no, all my gauges are good. It's good and everything else. Why are five guys
[00:58:36] jacked on Lee and Toby Thomas and sparks and Ritter and Gore got on the bird to go up to Ben
[00:58:44] Tui and unlike a thousand yards out from Ben Tui, the bird spun its rotors and inverted. And
[00:58:51] the guys, all of them were skydivers. So they all left the bird, you know, and tracking across the sky.
[00:58:59] But what happened is they, from what I know, is they hit the hit the rice paddies and stuck in the
[00:59:05] mud and drowned in the in the rice paddy. They couldn't get themselves loose from the from the mud.
[00:59:11] So that was that was a crime. We all cried about that. It was their all-greet great team guys.
[00:59:17] That was a bad day in our lives. What did you do with that platoon? Just backfilled it backfilled it,
[00:59:25] you know, and then we all kept working. Because when we got to C-flow, there was one butoon,
[00:59:32] Fox start was there. When we left, because there was so much action, we had four
[00:59:36] battoons at there trying to cover down on on everything. It was going on. Right. So it was a,
[00:59:43] it was a very active, active place. Another good up. I'll tell you about that was a square bay,
[00:59:50] square bay up, which was a location right up from the entrance of the Saun Kulan river. Can I
[00:59:57] was at night? The VC would run supply trains down across square bay in sand pans and deliver it
[01:00:06] to the VC, which were down south of us, that we were always hitting. So we found the south
[01:00:13] so we decided to set up an up on on square bay. So I built a twin 60-mount for the Boston
[01:00:21] Wailer, which we had, so I let run in, you know, 25s on. And we took that up the square bay and we
[01:00:27] parked it in a little cove up there and just waited that night. We had night vision,
[01:00:32] our great big night vision glass. And we're watching these sand pans as they're coming across
[01:00:38] a square bay and there was like 25 of them. And we said, wow, this is the wow, wow west. So we got on
[01:00:47] the boats, the boat driver was there, got on the 60s and we hit it and we hit it because the
[01:00:51] square bay very shallow, probably 10 foot of water. And we come across there blazing them 60s and
[01:00:59] all those guys in that, in that whole sand pan, sticking out like dogs balls. So we just let them
[01:01:07] have it, let them have it. With one Boston Wailer, one Boston Wailer, with 60s, 20s, 20s, 60s,
[01:01:12] all on it. Well, yeah. And there's how many sand pans? There's, I think there was like 40.
[01:01:17] So, and we had other team guys in the boats with the stoners and stuff, right? So we hit these
[01:01:23] guys, devastated. Devastate them, and now we got, now we got 40 sand pans full of fish, rice,
[01:01:30] guns, everything that the bad guys need down south. We waited for daylight with
[01:01:36] which was probably about 45 minutes, so we just let them set there, right? Waiting for any guys that
[01:01:42] kind of pool blood that want to get up and shoot again. So we just set. Then we approached once it
[01:01:48] started breaking daylight, right? So the only person that was alive was this old woman that was
[01:01:54] chewing beach nut, had like three teeth gone. So we, so we made her drive. So she drove all the
[01:02:05] sand pans back to sea float. It was wild. I know, I know there's hellows because there's hellows
[01:02:11] over the top of us. Somebody was taking a picture of that, but it was, it was a magnificent thing, right?
[01:02:16] And bringing all these sand pans back to sea float. And then we gave them two, we distributed
[01:02:22] them to the village that we had started, which was upriver. We had captured so many people at sea
[01:02:28] float that we started a village upriver, probably about a half a mile from sea float. And we just,
[01:02:38] that was our village, right? So we anything we would recover or anything else from the
[01:02:43] vehicle, we would give to the village. It was a fish and village, right? Started with like five people
[01:02:48] by the time we left country. It was like 1,500 people. Who are these people? They were just innocent
[01:02:53] fishermen and you know, an innocent citizens that had gotten caught up in the water, right? And
[01:02:58] they were trying to get out of the water zone. So we moved them up there. Great fishing, where it was at.
[01:03:04] And you know, they would go to market, you know, which was up in Wung Tal and not Fung Tal,
[01:03:09] but been to Y and sell their fish and all that kind of stuff. So they were just trying to make a living.
[01:03:15] So we would take everything to those guys. So that day they got Hawkeye's a fish and brand new
[01:03:20] sand pans and everything else they loved us. I loved those Americans. It's always very,
[01:03:25] that was very cool. Very, very cool. The old lady we took the old lady up there too. It's sitting.
[01:03:30] You have a new home now. She just kept going. She went to her beach nut.
[01:03:36] She was crazy. Crazy man. But that was one, that was one crazy op that made the history books.
[01:03:41] So it was, it was good. But yeah, we all got home safe, which was a blessing, you know,
[01:03:47] except for our five guys we lost their lives. And you know, and then we had the mighty moat,
[01:03:53] got ambushed on it went down south. We lost Mikey got hit then. She had got a purple heart didn't.
[01:04:01] Wawkesland got hit in the eye with the piece of
[01:04:05] scrap metal. What happened with that? What was the, well, the mighty moat was a big Mike boat,
[01:04:10] you know, had all kinds of armor on it and everything else. And what they were doing,
[01:04:14] which they shouldn't have done. We were trying to plunge away through a canal down to VC country.
[01:04:20] Well, the VC had grenades and had mines and everything else on it. So when the boat would go down there,
[01:04:26] it would catch on cables, right? And then snagged their props so they became in mobile. So they were
[01:04:31] setting ducks when all these mines started going off and they got hit from all sides by the VC.
[01:04:39] So the VC really shot the boat up again, sea wolves got us out of there, came in black ponies.
[01:04:46] Got us out there. We had to go pull the boat out. But the guys that were on the boat, you know,
[01:04:52] were inside and the rockets were going inside and the hot core was bouncing all over the place. So
[01:04:58] we lost, I think, two guys that day and Wawkesland got his eye put out and then a lot of other
[01:05:06] people got trapped metal wounds and stuff like that, off of the mighty moat. But that was not
[01:05:12] a good day and it probably shouldn't have happened, but it did. Right? So a lot going on when you're
[01:05:20] out there pushing. How did you decide when your last stop was going to be?
[01:05:27] Gosh, you know, I can't answer that question because we were working so hard, you know,
[01:05:31] and everybody goes, okay, we're going to stop operating two weeks, right? Before we take off,
[01:05:38] well, that didn't happen. We just operated up. I know that when I got home off of Op,
[01:05:46] I got my gear and put it on a heel and flew off. That's when my last two was. So
[01:05:53] and I know the rest of the guys were probably very close to the same. You know, because I was
[01:05:58] one of the last guys to take off. We did the turnover off with the new Patoon coming in, you know?
[01:06:03] And that's when we moved off of, we moved off of Seafloat and moved into Solid Anchor because
[01:06:11] they had built the base over on, you know, stabilized the situation enough where the she-bees
[01:06:17] could come in and build the base, you know, over on the shore. I always felt like it was a jinx
[01:06:23] to say, okay, this is our last stop. Oh, yeah. I never said that. No, I just, we just kept going.
[01:06:29] And then one day it was like, guess what, we're going to go home. So we can't do anymore. So that's right.
[01:06:33] That last stop that we just did. That was our last stop. That's exactly the same way. I thought it
[01:06:38] jinx it and go again, you know. No, and you know, because our world, it's push-push push. I mean,
[01:06:44] we're all jacked up to do everything we can and you want to do that. I mean, the time to sleep
[01:06:49] is on your way home. I know I came off of one of the Africa ops that we did down in Sierra Leone,
[01:06:56] right? And we'd say probably 3,000 people, you know, in that particular thing and got them back.
[01:07:03] Safe and stuff. And when I jumped on that C14 fund to come home, I looked at all the guys that
[01:07:10] were there with us. I go, man, this hero shit is really hard. And I went to sleep, man. I went,
[01:07:17] see you later. I was gone. Tell me, landed in Stukar, Germany. Yeah, it was wild. That was wild.
[01:07:24] But Vietnam was a great, and it's just what you said earlier. Vietnam was a huge learning
[01:07:28] ground, a huge proving ground for seal team. If we would not have had a head Vietnam, we would not
[01:07:37] be where we're at today. It's that simple. It's that simple. And you know, the guys, the personalities,
[01:07:44] they came from all walks of life, all walks of life. And we have that same thing today
[01:07:50] at Naval Special Warfare. I mean, I see it in every young man that I see it. Every one of them has
[01:07:55] got a different personality, but the fire and their gut and the fire and their eyes is there.
[01:08:02] And they want to do the job and they want to do it the best they possibly can. Right?
[01:08:07] With all the other crap that's going on, I mean, you got to give it to them in the men. And we're
[01:08:12] so fortunate to have the quality of men, both officers and enlisted that we have a Naval Special
[01:08:18] Warfare. Because they're professionally, they get the job done. Every nun then they drop the ball,
[01:08:23] but for the most part they get it done. Yeah. So, sir, you come home from Vietnam.
[01:08:28] I come home from Vietnam. I get on my Harley. And I sounds like a plan right there.
[01:08:36] It was a plan. It was a plan. I, well, I had a chopper shop. So I came home. I had a chopper shop
[01:08:42] before I left the two go to Vietnam. And I had so I had the chopper shop. Somewhere next to the
[01:08:47] I go. Yeah, in Imperial Beach. Okay. I be. So I built a bike. I built my first bike.
[01:08:54] Mike took off. I went back to Ohio. I said, you know what? I'm going to build a bike. And I'm
[01:08:57] going to go for a ride. So I built a bike tour to around the United States. Met Americans again,
[01:09:04] which was a real eye opener. Because you know, a lot of, like today, a lot of guys have a lot of
[01:09:09] mental problems adjusting from the war and stuff like that. I used to travel around the country to
[01:09:14] adjust myself, right? I didn't have a lot of money. I had a great Harley. And I would stop at work,
[01:09:20] get a job for a day or two, get some gas money, get some food money, put it in the tank, and I'd
[01:09:26] hit it again. And I, I made around the country and enjoyed the hell out. Are you on leave at this
[01:09:32] point? No, no, no, not a lot of the Navy. Oh, so this is, so you came home. Yeah. What do you do just
[01:09:36] when you got home? When I, well, when I just got home from Vietnam. I went back to the training
[01:09:41] so I was on active duty for another two years after I got home. When you planning to get out,
[01:09:47] when you got home, we were like, okay, what would Vietnam end it? You know, I don't, I didn't know.
[01:09:52] I was there for, you know, and the whole thing was I got out. I was out for like 90 days,
[01:09:57] did this trip around the country and then came back and got back on active duty, you know.
[01:10:02] And, and I said, well, you know, it's the only thing I know and it's the only thing I love. So I'll do
[01:10:07] that and then I got off of active duty cleanly and went into the reserves in 75. And in 75,
[01:10:15] that's when we started the seal reserve unit in in San Diego and also on the West East Coast.
[01:10:21] And so I was in the reserve unit, you know, as a second, third class, second class pediocer,
[01:10:28] made first class and the reserves. And then it was your civilian job at this point. I had a couple
[01:10:33] civilian jobs. I had a, I had a boiler shop that worked and did Navy repair ships over at that 30
[01:10:40] second street, Long Beach and then I go up the Swamana Island and do stuff up there because I repaired
[01:10:45] boilers because it was easy mechanical stuff, machinery stuff. And so I did that, had a company
[01:10:52] of probably about 15 guys. We did that for a while. Then I had got another company that did it and
[01:10:59] that grew to about 90 people, you know. And then I got rid of both those. I sold those and
[01:11:05] then up front of mine came to me and wanted to start another company with the, it's called the
[01:11:13] takeoff and estimating system. Company was called Texanics and we came out with and devised a
[01:11:19] system where if you put a set of building plans on the top of a digitizing board, we had a
[01:11:28] guy that wrote the algorithm that would could tell you. If you touched that stylus and two different
[01:11:33] points, it would give you the dimension of that eight foot wall, tell you all the pieces that you
[01:11:38] needed to build that, tell you what your labor cost would be and everything else. So we sold about
[01:11:42] 5,000 of those systems across the world and we sold that company to a group of Canadian guys.
[01:11:50] And that's when I went to reserves in 1990 and they said, hey, we need some volunteers to come back
[01:11:57] for Desert Storm Desert Shield and I went, I think that's me. So, so that's when I re-engage. That's
[01:12:05] when I re-engage with the level of active duty at that point. Did you expect that whole time in the
[01:12:10] reserves? At the 15 years I'd spent in the reserves. Which is one weekend a month, two weeks in
[01:12:15] summer, some months. Weekend in a month, yeah. Weekend a month and two weeks during the reserves. And we,
[01:12:20] we were very creative about that. We, you know, we would do cold water training in the Colorado
[01:12:26] River and a big raft, yeah, that was good. And then we do cold weather training and, and
[01:12:33] mammoth of the. Yes, yes, trying to get down the hillless passes you possibly could. It was
[01:12:40] hell, but somebody had to do it. But we always got the shoot and we got the blow up things,
[01:12:44] keep our calls up, we got the jump, which was better in the reserves than it was on active duty
[01:12:50] because you always had assets. So that was very cool. So for those 15 years, that's pretty much what I
[01:12:55] did. And then 1990, when I got callback to active duty, I went to Seal Team 3, started working
[01:13:03] at training cell with Mike Martin and K bar and a couple other guys that were there and
[01:13:08] were you a master chief at this point? No, no, as a first class. Oh yeah, oh yeah, because in the
[01:13:14] old days, rank never meant anything. I mean, some of the ups I was telling about in Vietnam,
[01:13:19] we ran on the second class pedigles. You know, I mean, so the rank was never a big deal.
[01:13:27] And so not till I got back on at 1990, I did our realize that rank was a big deal. And I went,
[01:13:34] Jesus, I guess I better study. So in the chiefs to us come around, I took the chiefs to us. We were
[01:13:41] in German then not, you know, and it's so interesting to think I didn't know about in German.
[01:13:46] So how far up was Mike Martin? I have you checking back into Seal Team 3. Oh, he's great. Well,
[01:13:52] Mike when when Mike originally came back, he lived with me. You know, he moved in the house. We
[01:13:56] saw a bit of him. Mike got out. Yeah. And then what did he do? Because it's a good story. Oh,
[01:14:02] he absolutely like Mike got on the, Mike got on the bike. I built him and rode back to Ohio. That's
[01:14:08] where he met Gail, his wife, right? So Mike went to work at the steel mills back in Ohio,
[01:14:15] working the steel mills with his, with his new triumphant motorcycle. Right. So he'd ride it there.
[01:14:20] And he was working there. That's where he'd learn to tattoo. You know, he'd run into a guy back there
[01:14:26] that was also a biker and learned how to tattoo from the sky. And that became his new career.
[01:14:33] Well, the steel mills after 13 years, the steel mills were going to close down. So Mike went to a
[01:14:41] reunion in Florida and saw Steve Frisk, who was one of our, who Mike worked with in Vietnam.
[01:14:48] He was one of the two man ops, right? Him and Steve would do the two man ops together. And myself and
[01:14:53] Leon would do the two man ops together. We went down there, saw Steve and Frisk was a commander.
[01:14:59] I think in the teams at the time. And Steve goes, hey, if you want to come back in,
[01:15:04] oh, help you. So that's how it happened, right? Got back in. Um, because of a, something that like
[01:15:13] I am bad or something like that. I don't know what it was, but as a program, they had where they're
[01:15:17] trying to bring, you know, vets back on that had skills and stuff like that. And Mike got it and fell
[01:15:22] into that category. Well, then he calls me, you know, and I'm still in the corporate world doing
[01:15:28] business and stuff like that. And goes, hey, hey, it's me, Mike Martin. I go, I know a lot of Mike's
[01:15:33] who, you know, me, you. And so he starts going off on me and I go, all right, Mike, I got it. I got it.
[01:15:38] So he came out hung around. I gave one of my bedrooms and, uh, and he lived with his
[01:15:43] belly. Got back on his feet and got his family moved out here. Everything else, but what a wonderful
[01:15:48] deal for him, right? Because of steel models, we're down. There was no job for him back there. And
[01:15:54] he was able to get back on active duty and come back on active duty. And everybody knows what
[01:15:59] his stud, he was. So that was just the cool besides wonderful personality, wonderful man, wonderful
[01:16:05] wonderful man, great brother, great great brother. So we had, we had tons of fun, you know, rehash
[01:16:11] and the thing. And then all the new personalities at, you know, at, at team three, like Sharazee,
[01:16:18] you know, like, you know, and then we're like on and on, like the Chang, right? So it was, uh,
[01:16:26] it was, it was a welcome, you know, thing for me to come back into because being in the business
[01:16:32] world, you don't have that kind of camaraderie that you do with the guys, right? So the guys are
[01:16:39] there and that's what it's all about anyway. It's about the brotherhood. It's about the camaraderie.
[01:16:44] You have with one another coming back. And I know Mike and I miss both of that and when we came
[01:16:47] back together at Seal Team three, it was just happening. So we let it go from there, you know,
[01:16:53] and that, uh, and it proved to be fantastic. So I was in Seal Team three from, uh, from the 90s
[01:17:01] until 95, 95. I got, uh, orders, which I was a chief now, uh, over to Stukar Germany to move
[01:17:11] unit two from McRainey, Scotland down to Stukar, right? I get over there and I'm going Holy
[01:17:17] crap, uh, Germany, right? And my wife is going, wow, Germany, because she's, if starting to travel
[01:17:24] and she loves it, right? So we got over there and then we got into the, uh, into the world of,
[01:17:30] of moving from McRainey, Scotland. We had to go get all the stuff from the base at McRainey,
[01:17:37] Scotland, which is a story all its own and drive it down to Stukar, and they gave us the worst
[01:17:44] base in Stukar to fix up, right? That Panzer Cancer, which was wrong, all tanker. Yeah, yeah,
[01:17:55] you know, and that's all, that goes a whole new thing, but we, uh, they still have the cranes
[01:18:01] in the base there to pull the engines out of the Panzers. Yep. They're in there, they're in the
[01:18:06] base. It's like part of the building. I know, I know, all those, all those cages that you see in
[01:18:10] there, guess who put those up? I'm going to get them back in a new day. Yeah, yeah, so it was wild,
[01:18:15] but I had the ordinance department training department at the time when we were moving then.
[01:18:19] So that was, that was a good thing. And then we got onto the E-sat team and the RST teams,
[01:18:26] where we had to start. One second, you threw your wife into the scenario there. Yes, yes.
[01:18:30] When did that all start? Oh, yeah. Wow. I probably should discuss that. My wife was my biggest
[01:18:37] supporter, right? So, you know, as, as we were going through this and going back on active duty in the
[01:18:43] 90s, she had never been involved in the Navy at all, right? So, Mikey and I are going out to
[01:18:49] Nyland to train the guys at Nyland. And I'm going, hey, honey, I'm going to be gone for a couple of weeks.
[01:18:55] Well, she was a professional woman, had her own career and stuff like that. And our son was
[01:18:59] John was old enough to kind of take care of himself. She'll, she'd say, okay, well, just call me,
[01:19:04] let me know what it is. So it wasn't that big of an unfair. So we were going and then she worked
[01:19:09] for San Diego Gas Electric. So when I got orders to Germany, she retired from San Diego Gas Electric.
[01:19:16] And this was a new adventure for her. So she was all excited about going the Germany and everything
[01:19:21] else. And so it was great for her. I mean, she absolutely loved going there. Did you, was your son
[01:19:27] old enough to, that he went to Germany or not? No, he was, he turned into a college boy. Okay.
[01:19:33] College boy in my house paid for it. Yes. All my neighbors were calling me a Germany.
[01:19:40] Go on. They're wrecking the house. They're wrecking the house. I'm going only corrupt. So,
[01:19:44] oh, you left him here? Go on. Yeah. College in your house? Yes. Yeah. Big mistake. But, you know,
[01:19:52] what we lived through it, that's a whole part we lived through it. So she was very excited about it.
[01:19:56] So it was, it was a fun, it was a fun move because it was her first one. As we go on through the
[01:20:02] career, she's going, this is not getting to be as much fun as I thought. Right. So she got there and
[01:20:08] we got moved on to Kelly Barracks, right? Well, because I was a chief, I got the top floor, right?
[01:20:15] And the Barracks, well, there's four floors. 90 steps every time you go up, no elevators. So every
[01:20:22] time she would buy groceries, the groceries would be waiting at the bottom of the steps for
[01:20:26] guests who would carry up when I got home. Right. Laundry, she would bring the Laundry down. I'd take
[01:20:32] the Laundry back up. And it was like, oh my God. So now I know why the Germans have such strong legs
[01:20:38] because they were up and down those things. It was crazy. So that was, it was a good move. We got into a
[01:20:46] real rhythm over there where we really justified general Lambert was the general there and he loved,
[01:20:53] you know, naval special warfare. So we justified by being on the ESAT teams and being on these
[01:21:00] RST teams. We justified our existence there and everybody wanted us to be there because anytime
[01:21:06] we would go on an operation, the operation would work perfect. That's where the kneels came into
[01:21:12] how we started doing the kneels in Africa. That's a non-combatant evacuation operation,
[01:21:18] where there's something going wrong in a country, whether it's civil unrest, it could even be disease,
[01:21:23] it could be disastrous, it could be anything, but there's a problem and somebody's got to get
[01:21:28] basically the Americans out of there. And so you've seen them happen all over the world and you did
[01:21:34] you did one where, Liberia or Sierra Leone, Liberia? We did one in Liberia, we did one in Brasaville,
[01:21:41] we did one in Sierra Leone and we used, I mean, you used all methods and the reason, this is
[01:21:48] the reason why they wanted us on because we were the Marine peace to it. So if there was any
[01:21:52] landings that had to come, I had to survey the beaches before the guys got there,
[01:21:57] had to make sure they had access on and off of the beach, all that kind of stuff. I was secure.
[01:22:02] That was my job, plus going to the embassies, find out what kind of supplies they have,
[01:22:07] what kind of food, what kind of medicine, all those kind of things. So when they called us to go
[01:22:12] down and do this, you kind of took control. You worked at the ambassadors, has pretty much
[01:22:19] but the military guy could take over at any time. Yeah, because this is those, these operations
[01:22:25] are so vast in the responsibilities, could you got security? Yeah. Obviously, but you got logistics,
[01:22:32] you got medical, you got food supplies, there's all these things that have to do with the place.
[01:22:37] I mean, it's a, it's a massive undertaking to get 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 people rounded up,
[01:22:46] marshaled into an area and then extracted from that area. I mean, that and keep them comfortable
[01:22:52] the whole time. At least as someone comfortable, otherwise you're going to hear about that too.
[01:22:55] Yes, you will. I'm going to call my representative, but that's, but that's a whole thing. That's
[01:23:00] I mean, we had to go out in town. I'll break it down just like the first one, the first one we
[01:23:05] went on was in to Liberia. Liberia was, we landed in Sierra Leone, I use Sierra Leone as a safe haven.
[01:23:13] And that was the best place to do that because we just surveyed the airport and stuff like that.
[01:23:18] Well, you know when Sierra Leone is your safe haven, you know you're going into a rough neighborhood.
[01:23:23] You can see your Leone is that safe. That's safe. That's right. It's not the safest neighborhood anyway.
[01:23:29] So we flew in the Liberia and the, and the embassy was basically under siege. So we had to shut the
[01:23:35] siege down, close the gates up, take care of the bad guys. That were there and start, you know,
[01:23:41] vetting people coming into the compound, the embassy because the ambassador wanted to save as many
[01:23:47] people as possible. He said, that's great, but they're not bringing everything they got, especially
[01:23:51] people with American passports to come in. So we were, we probably flew 90 chalks out of there
[01:23:59] of people with the, with the thing. I mean, when you're flying in, you're flying in low,
[01:24:04] a rocket team tried to, to take us out going in and, and the door gunner with the minigun,
[01:24:10] got pointed in the right direction and that rocket team disappeared. So that was very cool.
[01:24:15] And so we flew in, we had a chop trees down, we had to move light poles, we had to do all this
[01:24:21] for this evacuation plus. We had to tell catalog everybody coming in, take care of medical stuff,
[01:24:27] coming in and everything else. So our job was was big, was big and the ambassador loved this,
[01:24:33] but, but it was a big job. So we were on that siege probably for about two and a half weeks,
[01:24:38] right? So the, we evacuated, I think, close, well, 90 chalks, so probably,
[01:24:46] probably close to 1,500 people on that thing and getting them out there. And they were all people
[01:24:52] with American passports, our tied to an American passport, one of the other. So we,
[01:24:57] we turned that whole thing over to the Marines when the Margot there, that's their job.
[01:25:04] And everything, everything was pretty well done. We had to go back in the, in the, the country,
[01:25:09] fly in, we'd run security, we'd pick up people and, and bring them back, we had to recover the
[01:25:14] ambassadors, Egyptian daughter, the Egyptian bassers, daughter that got taken away by bad guys.
[01:25:20] So we had to go convince them that they didn't need to keep her. So we helped them with that decision.
[01:25:26] And then we, and then we got her back. So he was quite grateful and everything else. And then,
[01:25:32] and then the news media started showing up and they wanted it to go on. But, but in Liberia,
[01:25:37] they have a, a cannibal community. So we used to call them the street sweepers because
[01:25:43] in, during the day when the battles were raging and stuff like that, all the dead people would
[01:25:48] be removed at night because the cannibal should come and go, who'd be?
[01:25:54] Roadkill. Roadkill for dinner. It's exactly.
[01:25:57] To be human.
[01:25:58] Happened to be here. That was classic. That was, that, that's a first time ever seen anything like that.
[01:26:03] But it was something I think every human being should see and realize that it's out there.
[01:26:08] But it was wild. So we were able to successfully close that down and move on. A lot of first
[01:26:16] came out of that. That was the first time that a P3 had a camera mounted in it and was flying
[01:26:23] overhead and we could get the images from the city. So that was very, very cool. That was a 96.
[01:26:28] So, and you know how that's grown today with all the drones and everything else today.
[01:26:34] So yeah, it was, it was quite an operation for shielding to be there.
[01:26:40] And then you stayed in Germany. And you did the other thing you mentioned, I mean, in order to prepare
[01:26:46] sort of logistically and just for planning purposes, you guys would travel around and go into
[01:26:51] countries and say, okay, if we have to do this in this country, here's some contacts,
[01:26:54] or some people here, some places, or some recon's, check these things out.
[01:26:58] And then also at this time Bosnia was going on.
[01:27:00] But it hadn't kicked off yet. It was still kind of kind of bubbling up. You know, in the 90s,
[01:27:06] it was still going. We would fly around. We did probably like 11 different embassies
[01:27:11] where we put together packages on that and knew exactly what needed to be done.
[01:27:16] If for some reason, the Americans and those particular countries had to be evacuated. So
[01:27:21] that's something that's a standard type of operation. They just got us involved in it
[01:27:26] because we did a good job with it. And we had a team of Army guys, Air Force guys, and everything else.
[01:27:32] You know, and then I left them and then I left Germany in probably 98. And I'm trying to think,
[01:27:42] I probably had my first, we were in Bosnia because we were going to Bonstheel all the time.
[01:27:49] And I probably did, I don't know, like four months over there before I took off and had it back.
[01:27:57] But once I came back, then I was the, I went to group one and then was the weapons officer there.
[01:28:03] And that's when we put the mark 46 and the mark 48 into a contracting play and got those two weapons.
[01:28:13] So unless you, oh yeah, those are heavy weapons. They're the best. As we call them, they're firebrothers.
[01:28:20] Yeah, they are firebrothers. So we got that done and as soon as I got that off and running and they
[01:28:26] started the manufacturing, those, then I got sent the Spain. And that's when the, I took
[01:28:32] or the training department in Spain at Unit 10. And we knew, was that? That was 2000.
[01:28:38] 2000, 2003. I went over there. And that's when we started running Bosnia. We did a couple
[01:28:47] of African gigs then. But, of course, of all was there. Of course, of all was still in Germany, too,
[01:28:52] because we were running at 10. And that was, let me back up a little bit. But the
[01:28:57] course of what war, as well as Bosnia, they were filthy ones. Yeah, the guys that were there,
[01:29:06] they were just the serves, were fucking, you know, they were horrible people. Harrible, horrible people.
[01:29:14] I don't know what possessed them to be the way that they are, but they were horrible people.
[01:29:19] They had no qualms about shooting innocence, none at all. And we had no qualms about shooting
[01:29:26] people with guns. So it was good. You always heard the story about the building, where the
[01:29:33] 130 blew the corner of the building out, because we couldn't find a sniper that was in it.
[01:29:39] Okay, I was there when that happened. And I also was there when we, we went that we re-elicit
[01:29:45] in the paper on the paper building steps. There was like 10 of us and we were flipping off to the
[01:29:51] snipers when we were doing our re-enlistment. It was great. It was great. And so, because we had our
[01:29:57] countersniper's up, all we wanted to see was a barrel. Please, let me see a barrel. And so that was
[01:30:02] that is actually when sniper Alley just lost all its support. After we blew that building down,
[01:30:11] Kill and try to kill that one guy. There wasn't any other sniper's that really were on sniper
[01:30:16] Alley after that. So it kind of lost its weight because they knew that we weren't going to hesitate
[01:30:22] to take the buildings down if we couldn't get the guys. So they would ask us in, in Ramadini,
[01:30:28] you know, for good counter, counter sniper technology. And we'd say you guys have the counters
[01:30:34] sniper technology. It's called an M1 Abrams tank. That's right. That's the best counter sniper
[01:30:38] that I've seen. Oh, you want to shoot a snap from that building or at least one of those buildings
[01:30:42] over there. Cool. Watch this. That's right. Those are the ones, man. Those things. Those are the
[01:30:48] snipers. They, yeah, they do the trick. It's called Orphalode and there's a reason for it. Right. That is
[01:30:55] so cool. So cool. But that was a good thing. And we would fly back and forth the Bosnia all the time.
[01:31:00] And then of course, of all was exactly the same thing. We'd be in the woods with Jason,
[01:31:04] those guys down in the woods. And it was, you know, that was our business. And we did a good job
[01:31:10] of it. Everybody loved having us there. It's all in the United Nations people. So you were in Spain
[01:31:14] when September 11th happened? I was. I was in Spain when September 11th happened. And I had just
[01:31:20] come back from the range walked into the training department and was watching this on the TV.
[01:31:28] And I go, what movie is that? It was no movie. It really, really sent us home. And we had to move back
[01:31:38] on base after September, though. We had to move back on base and everybody started starting going.
[01:31:44] How are we going to prep for it? Where are we going? We had a couple of people come by and talk to us that we
[01:31:50] were going to be doing different things. And we did those different things, right? But none of us,
[01:31:57] I don't think any of us at that time left to go to Iraq. I think it was more of a supportive kind of
[01:32:03] thing that we had at 10 because I was still doing Africa, gigs going on to Africa at the time.
[01:32:09] I think most of the Iraqi, Afghanistan kind of thing at the time was still happening from east
[01:32:19] and west coast. That's what they broke it off. And Admiral Wilson came by and told us that it's
[01:32:24] going to be a slow crawl. We're not going to get it for the long term. We're going to take our time.
[01:32:29] We've got to plan. We're going to make sure we don't burn out our guys. All right. So that was
[01:32:34] good information. Good information. Then I left a thing. Thank you as thinking 20 years at that time.
[01:32:38] I think that he's a smart enough guy where he was going, yes, I think so. Yeah. He's very smart guy
[01:32:45] in a little bit of AdMolson. Yeah. Great. Great guy. All the senior officers, especially the officer
[01:32:50] detailer, who I called and said hey, get me to a sealed team, please right now. He was like,
[01:32:55] this thing is going to last a long, long time. Yeah. And yeah, he's right. So then where did you go
[01:33:01] when you got done with Spain? Then I came back to because that was like 2003. I came back
[01:33:08] to trade it. That's when Ronnie Cooper, Joe Burn, all the boys we put together trade at one.
[01:33:18] Got it. And I was the ops chief for trade at one. So Mike Turcott was, if you know, Mike,
[01:33:25] he was the boss in the ops shop. So we started putting together that, which was fascinating. And I
[01:33:32] did that from the inception of trade at two like 2005. And then I got a call from a good buddy of mine,
[01:33:43] Doug MacNutt. I don't know whether you know him or not, but he was a detailer. And he goes,
[01:33:48] hey, because George Young had gotten hit over when he was over in Iraq. And he needed a place to kind of
[01:33:55] settle because he was getting retired. I said, well, you take my shot, my spot here. And I'll find some
[01:34:01] place else to go. And so that's when Doug MacNutt, I thought I was going to stay west coast, right?
[01:34:08] He goes, I got a hard and to feel billet. I go, hey, where's it at, man? He goes, why?
[01:34:14] I go, why? I feel billet in Hawaii. He goes, yeah, I need an ops chief over in Hawaii. I said, well,
[01:34:23] you know, I'll go, not knowing I have to go to SDV school. Oh, to go to this billet, right? So now,
[01:34:33] I'm a senior citizen almost. And Doug's going, yeah, you got to go to SDV. Are you a master chief yet?
[01:34:40] I made master chief at SDV school. Okay. So it was so interesting. The interest in me, George was my
[01:34:46] third platoon chief. Right. And then when I took over trade at was when he was the master chief of trade at.
[01:34:52] Oh, okay, okay. So George, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. So that's probably his, what he did have when he
[01:35:00] went to the odd took my job. And then he became, because I think Ron Cooper was the master chief
[01:35:06] of a trade at and he probably relieved Ron Cooper probably. Probably. So anyway, off to 2005,
[01:35:13] he was the SDV school and Panama City. How far did you? I was like 56 at the time. Yeah. So yeah.
[01:35:22] For those of you that don't know what an SDV is echo. It's sealed delivery vehicle. It's a
[01:35:28] miniature submarine, but it's not a submarine that keeps you dry. It's called a wet submarine. So
[01:35:35] it's got a motor on it. And it's, it's enclosed, but water comes in and out of it. So you wear a
[01:35:40] scuba rig inside of this thing. And because otherwise, you know, you'd have to worry about pressurizing
[01:35:45] this thing and you have to be his home. You have to get in and out of it. And so that all that would
[01:35:49] make it too complicated. So they just take a basically a shell, put a motor in it, and then you get
[01:35:55] inside the shell, and you drive this small underwater submarine. Is that that like real claustrophobic one?
[01:36:01] Do you know, yeah, you'd be lucky if you're, yeah, okay. It's very claustrophobic. Especially if you're a big guy.
[01:36:07] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's, it takes a lot of skill to drive them. And then, and when you have a
[01:36:14] driver, you want to keep that driver that's real good at it. I was not real good at driving the boat
[01:36:20] because I need him my glasses. That's what they give for him in a 57 year old. You're a good
[01:36:28] thing, right? So anyway, how long is that school? The school is three months. At least it's in
[01:36:36] Florida. Oh, yeah. But still you're doing what eight hour dives. Oh, yeah, all the time. All the time.
[01:36:42] Take on the boat apart, put in the boat back together, doing it. I mean, you're just, you're doing what you
[01:36:46] have to do. I mean, you got to know the head, your motor head. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I can take the
[01:36:52] boats apart and put them back together. Drive and almost see in all the other thing, right? And
[01:36:56] state, keep it on, keep it on level and all that kind of stuff. Hey, one chance. When you can't read the
[01:37:01] numbers on the beef, that's how it gets challenged. Give me words, my glasses. That's why I always
[01:37:06] let somebody else drive. And I would ride them back. Go on. But it was, but it was interesting. It was
[01:37:12] an interesting time. It's something I kind of enjoyed. I wish I was better at it. But, but I wasn't,
[01:37:18] but I still went to SDV team in Hawaii. So I went to the team in Hawaii. I became the combat
[01:37:25] systems officer over there because Jim Merrell at the time was retiring. And so I took over
[01:37:31] his job. And that is where we started working and doing a whole lot of very, very cool things that
[01:37:37] they're doing today. And so it was a fun gig. I mean, it was a fun tour over there. And then when I
[01:37:45] left that, I actually went to work on our dry submarine that was over there. And it kind of burned
[01:37:52] up so I kind of lost my job over there, which really pissed me off because I was really getting
[01:37:58] good at paddle boarding. And so the, so I had to come back to work on. And that's where I took the
[01:38:06] program over in N.8. And that's kind of where I wrapped up my career. It was running that program
[01:38:14] and running the palms and the funding lines and everything else to keep the new SDVs because
[01:38:19] now we have a new one. And keeping that and keeping the boys trained and getting them the gear
[01:38:25] that they need and it's evolved a lot since I had that particular job. So it's, so it's been
[01:38:33] very, very interesting. It's been a very interesting career. I mean, so 1967, you joined the Navy
[01:38:40] and now it's 2014. Yeah, the end of 2014. Is it when you finally retire? Yeah, after 47 years.
[01:38:47] Oh, yeah. Wild. That's what I held. And, and just for the note to all of your clients, I was retired
[01:38:58] for six months and then they sucked me back in. So I still work over there. Yes, every day I go into
[01:39:07] do things. And now I'm working analyst stuff that's for Naval Special Warfare and it's very exciting.
[01:39:14] I mean, I think and and Jockel tell you the same thing. I mean, once you work for the boys
[01:39:19] and you're working for the boys and for their health and they're benefit, you want to keep doing
[01:39:24] that because they're out there on the front lines. They and they require people just like us
[01:39:30] to keep pushing and keep doing the best we can do because we're we're speaking for them. They've
[01:39:35] got more than enough to do when you're out there in the war zone. Yeah. Yeah, so when I was the
[01:39:40] Admiral's aide for 13 months and one of the things that my boss would say in these big meetings,
[01:39:46] he'd say, what does that, what does that do for our seal platoons? Right. And that's the always
[01:39:50] the reminder for all the guys. It was at Warcomks, Warcomks really elevated. They're looking at things.
[01:39:55] You know, I remember I go to a meeting, they'd be talking about what kind of boat engine are we going
[01:40:00] to have in 2028, right? Yeah. And I'd be thinking of myself, how does this matter? And that's what he would
[01:40:06] say. He'd say, how does this affect the seal platoon? How is this going to, because you know what,
[01:40:10] the seal team's argument to be here in 2028? Oh, and you know what they're going to need? A boat engine.
[01:40:14] That's right. So if we don't plan for it, don't figure out what the best one is right now.
[01:40:18] Smart guys looking at it that have operational experience and that care. Yes. Then they'll
[01:40:23] end up with a piece of shit. But if you could do it right, that's how we got the the Mark 48, the
[01:40:28] Mark 46, right? Exactly. Because someone like you was saying, okay, this is what we need.
[01:40:32] Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's very true. And if you don't have people doing that and push
[01:40:37] in the future envelope, then you'll always be behind the parker. All of our peer-to-peer competitors
[01:40:43] are doing exactly that. And some of them are doing a better job than we're doing at it. So
[01:40:48] you we have to push harder. That's that's our job. And so there's your retirement. There's like
[01:40:55] 1500 people show up for your retirement. Right. There was more, but they couldn't get in.
[01:40:58] And it was at the at the lows hotel. Yeah. There was, I mean, people are piling in from everywhere.
[01:41:07] I mean, and I didn't know I knew that many people, but evidently I did it. So it was wild.
[01:41:13] It was wild. It was wild. You had five people speak? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And they were all great. I mean,
[01:41:18] they were all, all people that had a very important part of my career as I went through
[01:41:25] the Naval Special Warfare. You know, I mean, the guys that were e-fives with me that were now
[01:41:32] two star admins, they spoke. Right. I mean, I think I'm one of the only guys that's had an instructor
[01:41:40] from their training class, come and speak at their retirement. You know, I had, who was that?
[01:41:47] Mother-moi. Oh no. Mother-moi. I mean, the best CEO I had, John McTai was there. He spoke,
[01:41:53] added, you know, it was, it was fantastic. You know, so it was, it was very cool. It was very,
[01:42:00] very cool. Retirement couldn't have asked for it to be any better. Yeah. 47 years. You, you wrap up with
[01:42:08] that career. Yes. No, that was with waivers. Okay. Yeah. I know kid and a lot of waivers. It's not a
[01:42:16] waiver. It's a lot of waivers. And then you, you're still our working for Naval Special Warfare. But at some
[01:42:22] point, you realized that there was another mission that you wanted to get out. You wanted to attack.
[01:42:28] Absolutely. How, how did you, how did you get involved with, with your next mission that you got involved
[01:42:34] with? I will, um, yeah, let me go and, let me go into that. I had an old team guy. It seems like
[01:42:39] it always happens with an old team guy. Jeff Bramsted, who is, who is a sky god? Jeff Bramsted. Jeff came
[01:42:48] to me when I, right after retired and says, hey, I need your help with this particular project that
[01:42:57] I've, I've taken on. And I went, well, what's the project? And he told me it was child trafficking.
[01:43:03] And I said, well, you know, I mean, I've dealt with that all over the world. Then we've saved
[01:43:08] thousands and thousands of kids all over the world because of, you know, assholes that that want to
[01:43:13] abuse them and use them. And I said, you know, we've done that. He said, but, but this is American
[01:43:19] kids on American soil. That kind of peaked my interest. He had a, um, uh, one of the PhDs at, um,
[01:43:28] USD had written a white paper. Amy Carver, Carverner, she had written a white paper. I read the
[01:43:35] white paper and I just went, wow, I had no idea that 3000 children a year. And Southern California
[01:43:42] were being either kidnapped or put into human trafficking in one form or another. And I said,
[01:43:50] you know, I have to get involved in this some way. So I met Joseph Travers, who is the, um,
[01:43:58] is the co-founder of Save Than America. Save Than America is a nonprofit organization. We don't
[01:44:07] charge the parents any money at all to go locate their children. The children half are the parents
[01:44:13] half that come to us. They give us the power of attorney of the child. And then the child becomes
[01:44:19] ours to locate to find locate and identify which they do. Many of them have. We recovered over 200
[01:44:26] kids so far. We will take that power of attorney. We will find the child, we'll locate the child,
[01:44:33] identify the child. And then we work with local law enforcement and have local law enforcement,
[01:44:38] come in and recover the children. Give the children to us so we can take the children to medical
[01:44:44] care, get any DA evidence off of them. And then we will take them into a counseling type thing
[01:44:52] or a safe haven so that they can come down off the drugs. A majority of them have heroin in them.
[01:45:00] They have some type of drugs that keep them, you know, in a very lethargic state so that these
[01:45:09] pimps and predators can do whatever they want with them. The very, very sad state and a heinous
[01:45:16] crime. When you're dealing with these situations where are these children coming from? How does it happen?
[01:45:24] They come from many different areas. The Southern California is one. We've come from all over the
[01:45:32] country. They come from poorer families. They come from rich families. There's not any
[01:45:38] demographics on exactly how they get there that we've been to determine yet. So we're only into
[01:45:45] it a little bit over 200 kids so far. We've been working in Southern California that's where
[01:45:50] our main location is at. We get a lot of support, philanthropic support from the community,
[01:45:57] philanthropic support from the government. So it's the local government. I mean,
[01:46:02] and that's the, that's kind of where we've been focused at. Now we've gone all the way to Florida to
[01:46:08] recover kids. We've gone to Utah to recover kids. We've gone to Phoenix Arizona to recover kids.
[01:46:16] And so that's what we're doing now is we're expanding, save the America from San Diego.
[01:46:24] We're over in Las Vegas at the end of the month. They had recovering kids. We probably got four
[01:46:29] kids over there that we've got information and in tell-on that we will go seek and find, call in
[01:46:36] local law enforcement and have them recover the children just as I mentioned. Local law enforcement
[01:46:42] loves us because we're a huge asset to them and helping them find, you know, these kids.
[01:46:49] Because they, they don't have the time. They're so overworked, so over-bearant by, you know,
[01:46:55] runaway kids or kids that gets, you know, into trafficking. They don't have the resources
[01:47:01] to do as much as they would like to do. So it's very frustrating to law enforcement.
[01:47:06] So when law enforcement hears about us, they are totally in tune to say, hey, come in and help us. All of
[01:47:13] us are private investigators. We're all insured in licensed. We all are CCW carriers. We have a
[01:47:20] whole network of private investigators throughout the United States that we can call on the
[01:47:25] Neem Mac people. So if we know that a child's been taken to another state, we will call a PI and that
[01:47:32] particular state. He will volunteer his time to go see if he can locate that child at a particular
[01:47:37] address or where we kind of direct them. If he finds the child, then we will fly a team from San Diego
[01:47:44] here to go set up, do the surveillance, do the watching, and everything that's required to identify
[01:47:49] that child to call in local law enforcement. That's how we've been working to date to recover
[01:47:55] these over 200 kids. Now this is a heinous crime. It's a crime that I have to ask everybody in your
[01:48:04] audience. I have to ask every grandparent, every parent that's out there to please be on the watch
[01:48:11] and be able to identify what's happening with this child trafficking things. These pimps,
[01:48:18] these perverts are taking these kids. A half the take them in public every non-than just to keep
[01:48:23] on. They keep them locked up most of the time and houses. And if you see them on in the street,
[01:48:29] don't be afraid to go seek law enforcement and ask law enforcement. That's something is not right
[01:48:35] with this particular situation because you may be saving that child's life. And that's what we
[01:48:41] want to do. That's why we're here. This all our whole organization is about the children. That's why
[01:48:47] we are bound not the charge the parents for doing this. People have charged parents in the
[01:48:53] past thousands of dollars and never found their child farm and how heart-wrenching is that. To be
[01:48:59] a parent you've already lost your child and now you're paying thousands of dollars to some unscrupulous
[01:49:05] person. And they're not locating your child. We'll locate your child. Usually the day it takes
[01:49:12] three to four days to locate a child no matter where they're at in the United States. We've got
[01:49:17] I've got great computer people. I've got great people that work behind the scenes to assist
[01:49:22] and help us even in Mexico sometimes. But we hardly ever go outside the United States. And because
[01:49:29] we work so well with law enforcement and supporting them. So this is the word I want to get out. We need
[01:49:35] your help. We need your support. Please go to our website which is saved in America.org.
[01:49:43] And the whole story is there. It's all about the teams. We're made up of retired special
[01:49:50] operations, guys, and retired police officers, some FBI guys, some old agency guys that I've
[01:49:56] worked with in the past. And I have a whole slew of IT guys that support us with chasing the internet.
[01:50:04] Because that's where it all starts from. So that's where I was going to ask you. When you see
[01:50:09] what are some warning signs for parents to look out for? Grandparents to look out for. Obviously
[01:50:14] the internet has got to be a huge one right now. Oh, totally. The internet is the media that gets
[01:50:23] them started, right? And a lot of them, we call it the Don Juan guys. So you have an older guy
[01:50:30] that is pursuing a younger girl, promising her all these kind of things. That's one thing you
[01:50:36] got to watch out for. When you're, if your daughter or your son shows up with expensive
[01:50:41] purses or different gifts and things like that, where are they getting it? They're getting it
[01:50:46] from these pimps because these guys are trying to lure them in to what a good life that they can
[01:50:52] show them. As long as they can possess them. And the Don Juan's will keep them for two or three
[01:50:59] months, you know, as a girlfriend or something like that, then one day they will sell her and she'll
[01:51:05] be gone. Then if she's gone, they will sell her on the weekends only the weekends because they'll
[01:51:11] bring them home so you can feed them all week long. And then on the weekends, you won't see them
[01:51:17] because the pimple have them out selling these girls. And I have to remind you that, you know,
[01:51:23] a one person that gives that these pimps do that is worth and they sell them throughout that
[01:51:34] weekend and a year's particular time, $150 to $200,000 a year. So that's just an idea. It's better
[01:51:43] than any drug that pimple or that drug dealer could push because they use them, they bring them back,
[01:51:50] they let them go back to either a community home during the week because they don't have the
[01:51:55] feed them, they don't have to keep them. They are your house and then on the weekends, they just
[01:52:01] call them up and off they go, get you know and the kids are 14 years old. So you know, you kind
[01:52:08] of say, what does a 14 year old know? A 14 year old doesn't know a whole lot, right? And they don't
[01:52:14] listen to their parents as well as they should. So it's kind of up to the parents to be able
[01:52:20] to be ready for the warning signs, be ready to do something. And if you have any questions at
[01:52:26] all, go to our website, save them America.org and ask the question and we can get you a
[01:52:32] steered to a counselor, get you steered to something that's going on in the cities. Like I say,
[01:52:38] if we're in one of the cities that we're involved in, we have counselors, we have people
[01:52:43] that you could talk to in those cities. Man, if you said 3000 in Southern California? Yes,
[01:52:52] shocking. That's why I got involved. That's what I so imagine. If that's what you have in Southern
[01:52:59] California, imagine what you have nationwide. That is, it's a crime and it's a heinous crime
[01:53:06] that nobody wants to talk about. You, I mean, they're talking about child trafficking, they're
[01:53:12] talking about the immigration problem and everything else. But nobody's talking about the child
[01:53:17] trafficking inside the United States of American kids, right? And it's done by all kinds of unscrupulous
[01:53:25] people. I mean, the first ring we busted here in San Diego was run by Russians on Pacific Coast
[01:53:31] Highway. And I was blown away when I went there. So these guys are, they got multiple girls,
[01:53:39] underage girls, and they've somehow gotten them off wherever they pulled them out of their house,
[01:53:45] and they've they've lured them in somehow. Yes. They've gotten them on drugs. Yes. So they've
[01:53:50] got them in a flacid, say to mind where they're not thinking straight. And then they're just,
[01:53:56] they're just selling them. Yep, they're cool. And let me go back a little bit, but in every
[01:54:02] middle school that we have here in San Diego, which is going to be shocking to many of the people
[01:54:08] that are listening is that they are recruiters. The gangs have recruiters inside the middle
[01:54:13] schools that are trying to recruit these girls, far the Don Wands, so that the drug cartels and the
[01:54:21] gangs have these as income sources. So if you go, the only, I mean, the schools have been real
[01:54:28] slow to recognize that this is happening. And they are still real slow to get programs in place
[01:54:35] to teach these kids about these recruiters that are in the middle schools. I'm middle
[01:54:41] schools. It's 14 years old, 13, 14 year old, that these recruiters are trying to recruit
[01:54:46] these girls and boys into this gang style life, or style of life, so that they can sell them
[01:54:55] on the weekends, bring them home to mom and let them be school girls during the week, and then
[01:55:00] traffic come on the weekends. So that is, that's something that's going on today. So
[01:55:08] everybody has to be aware of that. And that's why I asked parents and grandparents to please keep your
[01:55:13] eyes open and be aware of these kind of things because there is that evil out there and it is
[01:55:18] happening every day in our world. And these kids these days, like what you're talking about,
[01:55:24] is exactly what the, I don't know what the trend, I guess, called the trend of, you know,
[01:55:32] with social media, oh, I'm going to be rich. I'm going to be mature. I'm going to have a cool
[01:55:36] car. Oh, there's drugs. Cool. I'm going to be mature. I'm going to be mature. Girl, even though
[01:55:41] I'm only 14 years old. And so they see that and they get offered that. And that's, you know,
[01:55:47] I could imagine that's how a girl gets lowered into these horrible situations.
[01:55:51] It's exactly exactly right. I want to be older than I am. And I want more stuff. My family can't
[01:55:57] provide this for me. But my, my honey over here can provide it for me. It gets me new dresses,
[01:56:03] new purses, all that kind of stuff. Those are the kind of things. And those are kind of the red flags
[01:56:08] that every parent needs to be aware of. Man, all right. So saved in America.org is the website.
[01:56:20] You got your team on there. A bunch of old team guys, too. A bunch of guys I know. And all
[01:56:25] and all guys that now have their private PI license. So you guys are actually out doing the
[01:56:31] recon work if needed. Oh, absolutely. We're doing all the, where the rubber meets the road. We're
[01:56:36] there. We, and that's, that's how we find these kids. I mean, you know, the, the police department,
[01:56:42] if they had the resources to do it, I know they would be doing it. But they don't have the
[01:56:46] resources. And that's why that's why we're holding a fundraiser in November on November 7th
[01:56:53] at the Estonia Hotel in La Jolla. Please go to our website. Everything is on there. If you can
[01:57:00] afford to come to the event, it's going to be fantastic. We have, we probably have about
[01:57:09] 500. Okay. So what was the date on that? November the 7th. It'll be at 6pm. Our website has all the
[01:57:19] information on it. And you can buy tickets off our website. If you got any questions about it,
[01:57:25] please just go to the website. Send us a question. We'll answer that. It's for corporate people.
[01:57:31] They can buy tables of 10 for all of the other people that they have or all their employees.
[01:57:37] They can donate. They can do so many things that they can do to help sponsors and help support us.
[01:57:44] Awesome. Awesome. Well, I'll tell you what. We've been going almost two hours right now.
[01:57:50] I think this may be a good time to wrap up. I'll tell you right now. I'm going to listen to this
[01:57:56] and I'm going to have about a thousand more questions for you. Okay. That's good. Because I was just
[01:57:59] getting warmed up every, you know, when we start talking, I mean, the stuff about Vietnam and
[01:58:04] you know, the fact that you did a hundred missions, you probably debriefed three of them.
[01:58:08] Four of them. Maybe here briefly. I'm going to start thinking about those. And I'm going to start.
[01:58:13] I'm going to come up with all kinds of new questions. And it'd be awesome if you could come back on
[01:58:18] because I guarantee everybody that's listening. This is going to want to hear more.
[01:58:22] How I'm sure. And there's, you know, we a long time ago of friend of mine put together a
[01:58:28] book. I got like 20 guys from Vietnam to all right a story called the book was called the
[01:58:33] men behind the trident by Dennis Cummings. And there's like 20 different stories of, you know,
[01:58:39] the people is the first contact action that they had in Vietnam. One of my stories is in there.
[01:58:45] But it's a great read and it's out on Amazon. So if you guys get a chance, go spend through that.
[01:58:53] That's interesting. I actually have that book. Oh, good. I was looking at it today.
[01:58:58] What I'll do is we'll do it. Next time you come on, we'll go through your story.
[01:59:02] We'll talk about some more stories. And in that way, I seldom give out books that I'm going to
[01:59:07] cover on the podcast prior to covering them. I don't think, and it, sometimes people get mad.
[01:59:12] They go, please tell us what books you're going to cover. And I, and I don't do it because
[01:59:17] I don't even know what books I'm going to cover. Sure. There's so many books that I'll be,
[01:59:21] I'm reading five, six books at a time. And I'll go, okay, this one, I like this part now.
[01:59:25] And I'll cover that book because I cover a lot of books on the podcast. Sure. But yeah. So now
[01:59:28] everyone has a heads up. It's, it's men behind the trident. Men behind the trident.
[01:59:32] It's my Cummings. Yeah. Coming in. And we'll cover that next time you come on. All right.
[01:59:37] Beautiful. That would be awesome. You got anything else? And then you want to add?
[01:59:41] Just I want to, before I jump off, I want to thank all of you for your support to save
[01:59:46] the America. We definitely need it and make yourselves more aware of the human trafficking that's
[01:59:53] going on in the United States of America of US children. They're not foreign kids. They're US kids.

[02:00:24] of the tactics of the operational excellence and of the standard of will and of perseverance.
[02:00:31] That's never going to be forgotten. It's what gave me my life. Right on.

[02:01:28] learning how to get better. Echo. Yes. Are you looking to get better? Yes. Or are you trying to
[02:01:39] learn how to act better? Trying to. Yeah. I even worked out today. I feel like that. The feel
[02:01:44] good about that. I hope you did. I did. Any other things that we can do to get better? Yes. We can
[02:01:50] live. Oh yeah. Big time. We can't imagine camp coming up. I know sold out. But a point is

[02:02:05] waiting before we record it. We're sitting there. Jujitsu is going on. Your boys there. Oh,
[02:02:10] yes. Jujitsu. Other friends doing Jujitsu. And I'm sitting standing there looking at it,
[02:02:16] listening to you. Of course. And just watching people do Jujitsu. Yeah. Even watching
[02:02:22] Jujitsu people do Jujitsu. When you understand Jujitsu is like, filling my heart and just filling it to
[02:02:29] the brim. And I'm like talking to you. And then I even said, I was like,
[02:02:32] you just is so good man. I'm just watching people. You know, beginners, whatever,
[02:02:37] high level guys, whatever. It's so good. Unless when you do it, it's even better than watching it.
[02:02:43] You'll know. Ask the people who do it. You'll know. They'll tell you when you do it,
[02:02:48] you're going to need a key. Of course. And what you're going to get, none other than the best
[02:02:52] key. Unless you want the worst key, I don't know. But if you want the best one, you get the origin
[02:02:56] key. Get the best key from originmain.com. Made in America from the dirt to the shirt. Yes.
[02:03:05] From the seed to the ghee. So we got we got a bunch of awesome craftsmen up in Maine,
[02:03:15] craftsmen up in Maine, making these geese. They're also making geese. They're making rashcards for
[02:03:21] no ghee. I meant to say they're making shirts, t-shirts, sweatshirts. They're also making jeans right now.
[02:03:30] Jeans. Is there, I mean jeans are as American as Apple Pie, right? Blue jeans. So get yourself some
[02:03:40] blue jeans. You want American jeans. You know, right? Are there even any American, I mean,
[02:03:46] there has to be odd over there. There are some. And you know what they do? They make these
[02:03:52] hipster American jeans. And they sell them for $280. That's what they do. Okay. So you don't want
[02:04:00] those jeans. Unless you do, I don't know, but no, you don't. These are not that. So originmain.com
[02:04:06] get yourself some clothing of all kinds, including clothing for training, including clothing for
[02:04:14] working and for cruising. Yeah. All good. Of course. Also, you want to keep your body intact as
[02:04:22] well while training, while just cruising, whatever. But recovering. How about that? Yes, you do. Yes.
[02:04:31] Joint warfare? Yes. The, the, just go read the reviews on joint warfare. And then get some.
[02:04:37] Because I consider and tell you that I take joint warfare three in the morning, three at night,
[02:04:42] you take, you take three in the morning for your night. Three. I, what I was doing that when I,
[02:04:46] when I had like when you were injured, each now you backed off. I'm back on the, yeah, I just do three.
[02:04:51] Okay. Read the reviews. See what other people say. Because there's people that are like, oh, my
[02:04:57] mom had bad art for whatever, arthritis problems. Yeah. And they go on joint warfare, which has
[02:05:04] active proven things in it. Curcumin, right, tumor, two, two, two, Marick. Yeah. All those things.
[02:05:15] So yeah, joint warfare, get the grill oil. Get that's the combo. That's the combo. That's the,
[02:05:20] that's the dual hitter. Get that dual hitter. Oh, yeah. Big time. The, and here and I'm not
[02:05:26] recommending to do this, but for sake of this kind of experiment for lack of a term. If you're already
[02:05:33] on joint warfare and crew, try go off it. See what happens. I don't recommend that. Yeah, yeah,
[02:05:37] I don't really do it. I mean, that's just, it's more of a dare than anything, but Brett,
[02:05:40] try go off it. I've done it. I've done it. I've had a lot of complacency. Whatever. Okay. When you do
[02:05:44] legs, when you squat, guess what you're going to need, additional protein. The steaking and a cut it.
[02:05:52] So when you squat, when you do, you ever do heavy cleans, and like the next day, your whole
[02:05:57] posterior chain is like sore. Yeah. It needs. You know what it's saying to you? It's going
[02:06:04] mook. It doesn't go. So listen to your body. You don't people say that. You call it
[02:06:11] into your body. You know your body saying your body saying you're body saying you're so boy.
[02:06:14] I love it. You could. So get yourself some of those mook. Get yourself a, you know what I do when
[02:06:19] I do when I do legs. When I get done, I don't normally do this because it's pretty early in the
[02:06:24] morning. I'm usually not hungry anymore. When I do legs a lot of times I'll get done. I'll have a little
[02:06:28] handful of nuts. You know, we're talking seven o'clock in the morning. A little handful of mixed nuts,
[02:06:33] which people got to kick out of the way I say that. And then I'll do a little one scoop hitter. Okay.
[02:06:38] And this is right. This is like an hour. Yes. Yeah. Maybe like two hours after. Yes. For me, that's kind of
[02:06:43] so you don't believe in the anabolic window. You know what that is? Yeah. I know what it is. I
[02:06:48] wouldn't say I'm not a believer, but it's just not something that I, I even am hungry. I listen to my body.
[02:06:55] My body wants more. Well, here's the thing though. I, I have, I thought it was to me and my
[02:06:59] mind it was proven to anabolic window. Right when you're done working out, probably is into recovery mode.
[02:07:05] Then I read like all this stuff. Oh, there's no true. You're going to do this. And growth
[02:07:08] home alone. And all this like good stuff as far as you go. It's weird. So check this out. The things that I've
[02:07:13] been saying. Okay. Like I used to say, I got to eat steak all the time, right? Hey, I eat steak,
[02:07:18] steak, people. And then people all of a sudden, that's a, that's an actual thing now. The carnivore
[02:07:24] diet. Oh, I mean, like it's a real thing now. Yeah. That's the same thing with me. I'd be like,
[02:07:28] I don't eat breakfast. I don't like to eat until, you know, 10 to 11, I've all of a sudden it's called
[02:07:32] something. It's called intermittent fasting. Right? This is just stuff. I just kind of lived that way.
[02:07:37] Right. So now the sudden the same thing with people saying, oh, uh, uh, uh, your, your discipline
[02:07:44] depletes throughout the day. Wrong. It's actually wrong. It's now it's proven wrong. I was right.
[02:07:50] Well, so anyways, what I'm saying is listen to your body, the people say this. Listen to your body.
[02:07:55] I'm saying it. Say it that too. Well, I'm staying at right now. Listen to your body. No,
[02:07:58] your body says your body's saying milk. Yeah. And my wife, my wife mixed up a strawberry
[02:08:05] milk with the, do you have one of those nice blunders? Like the power blenders that has like a
[02:08:10] 40 horsepower engine in it. Yes, right. My wife mixed up a mole in there and she, I come home and she's like,
[02:08:16] I mixed a mole in those things and she was talking like almost an essential voice. Right? And I go,
[02:08:22] okay. And she goes, she said something she never said she goes, it was next level. Which he never says that.
[02:08:29] And then she goes, she goes, it's the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. That's what she said.
[02:08:34] She said those words fired up. It's the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. This is a protein
[02:08:40] shake. Right? That's, let's face. That's interesting. That's something. Right? Nothing. That's not
[02:08:45] true. Yeah. So yeah. And don't feel like a warrior kid milk because sometimes your body, your kids,
[02:08:51] you know what their body, their brain, their brain is saying, give me sugar. Yes. Right. Their brains.
[02:08:56] I give me a, give me a chocolate chip. Right. To answer that call, answer that call instead of giving
[02:09:02] the poison, give them something that answers the call, but makes them stronger faster, smarter,
[02:09:08] better. Yeah. Give them some warrior kid milk. Although I would not recommend that you tell
[02:09:14] you kids to listen to their body because their kids would be like, hey, my body's telling me I want some
[02:09:19] fucking candy. Well, if my kids don't need to say to that, yes, you listen, you, you feed them the
[02:09:26] right things. So milk. Yeah, because kids listen to their taste buds. They don't listen to their body.
[02:09:30] That's what I'm saying. Yes. You're right. So when your kids taste buds call out for that, that little
[02:09:36] sweetness hit me. Yeah. Give them what you keep the good slides right in. It's right in.
[02:09:41] Yeah. Easy money. Good. So there you go. Right on. And don't forget about white tea. Yeah.
[02:09:46] Jocco white tea. Taste good. Did you notice when Sean Parnell was on the podcast? He's like,
[02:09:53] this, I've had so much caffeine in it. And I was like, no, actually doesn't. There's only 60 grams.
[02:09:58] Yeah. What you feeling is the antioxidant kicker.
[02:10:01] Yeah. Well, I did drink four of them. Yeah. That's the same. And here's the thing. I drink four of
[02:10:07] them too before and the caffeine sneaks up on you. Because you keep, you're just, it's like a steady
[02:10:13] dose of caffeine. You're like, oh, yeah. So, and he's, you know, when you're in conversation and
[02:10:18] talking about stuff or whatever. So yeah, he got hit with a double triple whammy situation.
[02:10:22] Check. Also, Jocco as a store, it's called Jocco store. And this is where we, we collectively,
[02:10:31] we can get rash cards there. Oh, yeah. Let's say get out of there. When you do ring workouts,
[02:10:36] using your rings, you need to, you kind of need to wear rash cards. Yeah. Could you get, you'll get like,
[02:10:42] what is it? Rope Burr. Yeah. Basic rap, birr. Chafing, or your arms. Yeah. I got the, I don't do
[02:10:49] mine's not as intense as yours. The workout, but you know, you do like dips and in some push-up
[02:10:54] situations or whatever, you know, the various things. And I felt the chafing. My workout wasn't long enough
[02:10:59] on the rings. It wasn't long enough to actually get chafing. But I was in a chafing indication.
[02:11:07] So you get rash, guys. You can also get t-shirts. The t-shirts that I wear,
[02:11:11] JP to Nelson, I picture these clean and out. It's closet. Get rid of shirts.
[02:11:16] And I was like, that's why I'm not sure. So they say, it's all my shirts are the same.
[02:11:21] Yeah. If you like the shirts that I wear, or you like the shirts that echo, you can just get the shirts there
[02:11:25] in jocquist or dot com. Just leave any cool freedom. Represent. Def course course.
[02:11:29] Represent. Some of us representing Def course the other day. And I had a little bit of sort of
[02:11:35] of a little connect, right? Because you're kind of stepping up. Oh, yeah. But, and JP speaking,
[02:11:41] JP he posted a picture of one of the troopers representing big time in the wild at the UFC.
[02:11:48] Oh, yeah. That's right. There was a guy at the UFC. I saw it too. I tried to take a picture.
[02:11:52] Didn't get there quick enough. And my little daughter who was watching UFC with me,
[02:11:56] check. She was like, oh, you didn't get a picture. I go, someone's going to post it.
[02:12:01] Watch. You know, and someone posted even before JP. My little brother text me before JP
[02:12:07] texted me with it. Text me. He says, hey, someone was out to UFC wearing you guys shirt. He's
[02:12:12] with someone's at the UFC wearing the shirt that you designed echo troughs. And I didn't see that.
[02:12:17] But unless he did indicate, so the point there is, yeah, when you see, when you see another
[02:12:23] person in the wild representing hard on the UFC, oh, on the UFC or otherwise true, but you will,
[02:12:30] you'll feel that connect. And jocquist, I feel it too, man. In the boat of the
[02:12:34] ladies, yeah, yeah, connected. So that's that. Also, you can also get a trucker hat or flex or flex
[02:12:41] that or you can get a beanie winter is coming. Hoodies heavy medium light heavy and like medium
[02:12:49] heavy like I think they're heavy. They're heavy. They're normal. Hoodies is what I'm saying. And like,
[02:12:55] yeah, a lot of cool stuff. I got a new design coming out didn't even tell you. Boom. Oh, that's a big surprise.
[02:12:59] But it's, you know, probably lame. No, it's not lame. I, I pretty, if you will like you. There's no 50 50
[02:13:05] chance. Well, there's no 50% of the time when you show me something like dang, that's dope.
[02:13:11] 50% of the time I go, I don't like that at all.
[02:13:13] I'm proud. All right. Well, there you go. We're going to see about that one. And I predict that you like it.

[02:14:11] Like, be watch those excerpts because, you know, everyone's in a while, they'll miss, you know,
[02:14:15] this, you know, two hour podcast about, you know, something, maybe they didn't have the time
[02:14:20] of whatever. Maybe it's happened before. I'm saying that. But don't get the excerpts. So they can
[02:14:26] really get many of the lessons. You know, you need to make BTF Tony compilation. That's three minutes
[02:14:32] long of him just saying awesome stuff. It'd be longer than three minutes. Please. Yeah, well,
[02:14:37] I mean, I'm saying, just take the top highlights of, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[02:14:40] it's still might be more than three minutes. It might be my B88, in a video. Yeah, that is a good idea.

[02:14:50] encourage Kirby, her L looks like, yeah, then you can, you can watch the whole podcast. This whole podcast

[02:15:02] which is a little sonic boost for your brain that will make you think the right thoughts that
[02:15:08] you know you're supposed to be thinking. It's called psychological warfare, and it will get you
[02:15:12] over the edge of weakness and into the realm of strength. No, the winner circle. Yes,
[02:15:21] yeah, that's a good way to play. That's a good explanation. A little bit assoteric. A little bit
[02:15:26] but this on the left. Yeah, folks on canvas.com. If you want, visual representation of the path
[02:15:32] that you can stare at every day when you wake up in the morning, hang on your wall. My brother Dakota

[02:16:09] performance. I don't know. It's good for a lot of stuff, but that's a daily one as well. Anyway,
[02:16:14] but the kettlebells that I get 100% on it, 100% artistic ones go there. There's a lot of cool stuff
[02:16:19] on there is what I'm saying. I got it on. I got a bunch of books. Right now, I have a new book.
[02:16:24] It's available for preorder. If you want to let my publisher know that they should print a lot of
[02:16:30] these books, then go and preorder leadership strategy and tactics field manual. Not to mention,
[02:16:37] you know you, you don't want to get the second edition. How many chances do you get to get
[02:16:45] to get a first edition? You get one shot. Don't blow it. Don't blow it. As soon as
[02:16:52] as soon as humanly possible, I'm going to have a make a slight change to the cover. Second
[02:16:55] edition, I'm going to make it different. Just so I can tell PID positive identification from a distance.
[02:17:03] Oh, that's cool. I see you got the book. I'll sign it for you. But I realize where you were at,
[02:17:08] when the chips were on the table. You weren't there. You're in the blue. That's fine. Wait.
[02:17:13] Order that first edition. Leadership strategy and tactics field manual.
[02:17:17] Way that were your kid three. That just came out where there's a will. It is live.
[02:17:23] So Boston. And then of course we have way the warrior kid one and two.
[02:17:30] And you know me bad reviews. I've gotten on those books. Oh, man. Zero.
[02:17:35] Yes, man. Well, you did get a bad review from someone who didn't not only didn't read it,
[02:17:40] but didn't even know what it was about. Oh, yeah. One guy called that one that called said it
[02:17:44] looked like a bunch of toxic masculinity for children or something crazy like that. Yes.
[02:17:49] I could just repost it out about 10 million people ordered the book as soon as they saw that guy.
[02:17:54] Whatever that idiot's name was. Well, you know, and his defense. I mean, he did speak to soon.
[02:18:00] That's all. That was his mistake. He spoke to soon. Like without looking into it. He seems to say like that.
[02:18:05] And actually what I did as I of course just said, hey, if you want all sungear ones,
[02:18:10] you can actually read it. Yeah. Make your judgment. See, that's what he did.
[02:18:13] What really happened then, there's a lot of people jump on and said, hey,
[02:18:16] I'm a woman. My my daughter loves this book. And then someone else said, hey,
[02:18:20] this book teaches people how to be respectful. Hey, this person teaches everyone. And he finally
[02:18:25] relinquished his he recanted. Yeah. Apologize. I do. But his own fans. Like his own fans were like,
[02:18:33] I love your stuff. You're wrong. Yeah. You got them into it. People just came off the top.
[02:18:38] That's what's funny. Even my comical sort of overreaction of that guy being an idiot. I didn't do that.
[02:18:43] Of course, because I'm, you know, not going to do that. But that if I were to react it that way,
[02:18:51] you know, people would say, hey, jockel, you know, you're being too aggressive. He, you know what I mean?
[02:18:54] Like I would have been the bad guy. So it's not the same man. I'll send your copy. If you want it.
[02:18:58] And then you can read it. But then everyone else wasn't me that convinced him. It was everyone else.
[02:19:02] Yes. It was the the the the the the the the the the the the the troopers from the coming up. It was troopers coming at him hard kind. Yeah.
[02:19:09] You mean, well, not even hard. They were all the everyone just everyone. I mean, there was a couple people.
[02:19:13] It was a little stab. I don't agree. Yeah. So a lot of people were just like, hey, you should you should actually check it out because it's going to help you.
[02:19:20] Yeah. Actually, he's a human being be better. So he essentially got that corrected by people who actually read the book.
[02:19:26] And I'll give him a little bit of credit. He wreak he wreakanted and said, okay. Okay. I'm wrong. I should jump to conclusion.
[02:19:32] So technically is that a bad review technically. No, because they didn't read the book. Good point. You can't review something in experience. That is true.
[02:19:42] So there's that there's there's Mikey in the dragons.
[02:19:46] This should be with every child. The book should be with every child.
[02:19:52] Mikey in the dragons get this book for every kid that you know get it for the library get it.
[02:19:56] The field manual discipline goes freedom field manual get that book for anyone that you know that
[02:20:05] you actually care about as a human so that you can keep them on the path. And then of course,
[02:20:10] there's extreme ownership. There's that academy of leadership. The first books that I wrote with my brother,
[02:20:14] life, Babin about leadership and how you can take leadership that we use on the battlefield and apply it to your life.
[02:20:20] We got echelon front, which is my leadership consultancy, where we come into organizations and solve whatever the problems
[02:20:28] that they have through the one thing that matters. And that's leadership.
[02:20:35] Go to echelonfront.com for details on that. EF online.
