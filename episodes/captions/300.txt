[00:00:00] This is Jocobodcast number 300 with echo Charles and me, Jocobodlin. Good evening, I
[00:00:05] go. Good evening. And also joining us tonight, Dave Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.
[00:00:13] The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in transmitting to first Lieutenant Schmedley,
[00:00:19] Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, the Brevette Medal, which is awarded in accordance
[00:00:24] with Marine Corps Order number 26 for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the
[00:00:30] enemy while serving with second battalion of Marines near Chainsen, China on 13 July 1900.
[00:00:43] On 28 March 1901, first Lieutenant Butler is appointed captain by Brevette to take rank from 13
[00:00:51] July 1900. A awarded for actions, award department general orders number 177, December 4th,
[00:01:01] 1915, the president of the United States of America, in the name of Congress takes pleasure in
[00:01:06] presenting the Medal of Honor to Major Smedley, Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps
[00:01:12] for distinguished conduct and battle in the engagement of Veracruz Mexico on 22 April 1914.
[00:01:24] Major Butler was eminent and conspicuous in command of his battalion. He exhibited courage and skill
[00:01:31] in leading his men through the action of the 22nd and in the final occupation of the city.
[00:01:36] A awarded for action. The president of the United States of America in the name of Congress
[00:01:46] takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor second award to Major Smedley, Darlington Butler,
[00:01:52] United States Marine Corps for extraordinary heroism in action as commanding officer of
[00:01:58] detachments from the 15th, 13th, 23rd companies and the Marine and sailor detachment from the USS Connecticut.
[00:02:07] Major Butler led the attack on Fort Riviera, Haiti on 17 November 1915 following a concentrated
[00:02:18] drive several different detachments of Marines gradually closed in on an old French bastion
[00:02:24] fort in an effort to cut off all avenues of retreat for the Kaco bandits.
[00:02:31] Reaching the fort on the southern side where there was a small opening in the wall,
[00:02:35] Major Butler gave the signal to attack and Marines from the 15th company,
[00:02:40] poured through the breach, engaged the Kaco's in hand to hand combat, took the bastion,
[00:02:46] and crushed the Kaco resistance. Throughout this perilous action,
[00:02:52] Major Butler was conspicuous for his bravery and forceful leadership.
[00:03:04] So there you go. Major Smedley Butler United States Marine for 34 years.
[00:03:12] Fort in the Philippines, China, Central America, fought in the Caribbean during the banana wars,
[00:03:16] fought in World War I, although against his wishes he was more in support role.
[00:03:23] He's one of only 19 men in history to receive two medals of honor. He's one of only three men to
[00:03:30] receive the Marine Corps Brevei, metal, and the metal of honor. And he's the only man in history
[00:03:37] to receive two medals of honor and the Brevei metal. And with that career after he retired from
[00:03:49] the Marine Corps, he wrote a book called The War is a racket. You heard that right.
[00:03:59] The war is a racket. This is a book that harshly condemns war denounces the military
[00:04:07] industrial complex, vilifies the captains of industry and politicians along the way,
[00:04:14] and disparages Americans, America's foreign actions in war.
[00:04:19] So there's a bit of an about face going on. And these are some extreme views that he has.
[00:04:30] And when individuals make extreme statements, sometimes that's not the best approach to take,
[00:04:37] because sometimes extreme statements, though they may be true or parts of them may be true,
[00:04:45] it can also alienate the general populace and kind of lead people to throw the baby out with
[00:04:55] the bathwater on some stuff, meaning that they throw away someone's ideas, they throw away all
[00:05:03] of someone's ideas because some of the ideas that the person has or the way that they state them
[00:05:09] is an extreme manner, which is I personally don't think it's a good idea.
[00:05:15] Well, it's a good thing to understand. It's a good thing to understand because what that should
[00:05:20] tell you is that if you back off the extremity of your statements a little bit, you're going
[00:05:26] to get more people to listen to them. So that's a good thing to understand. And it's also a good
[00:05:31] thing to understand that if people are talking in a really extreme way, you shouldn't just say,
[00:05:35] you know what, this person just crazy, I'm not going to listen to them. Maybe you should actually
[00:05:39] listen to what they try and say and decipher what's just extreme and maybe not true, but are there
[00:05:45] kernels of truth in what people are saying? So I think it's a smart idea for us to listen.
[00:05:53] And I think as we have watched America's
[00:05:57] withdraw from Afghanistan in the late summer of 2021, after 20 years of war, after thousands
[00:06:07] of lives, after trillions of dollars, then no progress. Maybe we should at least listen to
[00:06:16] what this marine major general, smithly but the most decorated marine that ever lived,
[00:06:23] maybe we should listen to some of what he has to say and see if there are some things in there
[00:06:28] that makes some sense. We have to get a little basic understanding of smithly butler,
[00:06:35] who he was, where he came from, born July 30, 1881, eldest of three sons father was a lawyer
[00:06:43] in a junk and a judge. He came from a good background. His grandfather was a congressman
[00:06:48] and his father was connected. He was a connected guy and smedly butler went to an exclusive
[00:06:58] private school which is sort of an east coast thing. I mean I guess they have them out on the
[00:07:02] west coast, but on the east coast is a bigger thing to have exclusive private schools. He went
[00:07:07] to one called the Hav referred school. And so you kind of get this image, you know, you kind of get
[00:07:12] this image, okay, well, you know, he's this rich kid that went to this exclusive school and then
[00:07:19] you hear that he left school 38 days before his 17th birthday to enlist in the marine corps,
[00:07:29] which is I think we have to give him credit, right? We just have to say credit. That's pretty much
[00:07:34] what you say. Credit. He still got his diploma. They allowed him to graduate. He lied about his age.
[00:07:41] And gets commissioned to second lieutenant. So I don't know how he pulled that off.
[00:07:47] But this is back in the day man. There's no records. You're just showing up. How old are you? 23?
[00:07:52] I went to college. Whatever. People like, oh, okay. You know what I'm saying? This is back in the
[00:07:57] day. You're no. Isn't it the kind of or like your ID card is written in. Yeah. Like by hand. Yeah,
[00:08:02] you like change that one to a seven. You were good. Yeah, or you just make an adjustments. Yeah.
[00:08:08] So I feel like I missed out on a lot of stuff because I didn't have that kind of. I mean, we were close,
[00:08:14] you know, but we were just there were still tracking stuff. So he's 16 years old and he
[00:08:21] leaves his high school to go and join the marine corps. Show's up. Get to commission as a second lieutenant.
[00:08:27] And he's at the Spanish American war is going down. But he gets there a little late.
[00:08:32] Ends up showing up and get mo after it's been invaded. After it's been captured.
[00:08:36] Doesn't really see any combat gets assigned to the to the Philippine American war.
[00:08:44] He shows up there. He's bored at first.
[00:08:49] Get's in trouble. Get's temporarily temporarily relieved of command because he's drunk and doing
[00:08:55] whatever. Gets his job back. However, October 1899 he gets his first combat action.
[00:09:02] It leads 300 Marines in to take the town of Nova Letta. One Marines killed 10 of wounded. His first
[00:09:10] sergeant's company first sergeant's wounded. There's a little note about him like panicking at first,
[00:09:16] a little bit and then he kind of gets composure. And up in the box of rebellion.
[00:09:24] So battle of chains in this is in China. He definitely kind of shows up now. There's a wounded
[00:09:30] Marine officer and he is in the trench. Smedly but there's an entrench and he exposes himself
[00:09:38] to enemy fire to rescue the Marine. He ends up getting shot in the thigh. His commanding officer
[00:09:45] made your woller who later became the best man in his wedding. He commended him and wrote
[00:09:51] for such reward as you may deem proper for the following officers. Lieutenant Smedly debutler
[00:09:57] for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week and for saving a wounded man
[00:10:03] at the risk of his own life under very severe fire. And that's what got turned into the
[00:10:09] brevet promotion, which the brevet, if my memory serves me correctly, the Marine Corps had it
[00:10:17] for like maybe 20 years and it basically was you're getting promoted. It was a promotion. So that's
[00:10:22] why even when I read it says, oh he went from from from from first lieutenant to captain. It was
[00:10:27] a promotion and then they people that got promoted that way. They eventually got an award called
[00:10:33] the brevet medal, which looks like the ribbon of a medal of honor. The medal of honor has the
[00:10:39] white. It's a light blue. The brevet with the light blue with stars. The brevet is red with stars.
[00:10:46] But it looks very similar as far as the ribbon goes. So he gets that promotion. He ends up in the banana
[00:10:52] wars. These are police actions. And these are police actions that we're conducting to maintain
[00:11:02] you know trade and and the way we want things to be. The way America wants things to be
[00:11:09] in Central America and in the Caribbean. Honduras rolls into Honduras. He gets tasked with defending
[00:11:16] the US consulant during a revolt there. He rescues the consulate in Trujillo. He gets this
[00:11:22] nickname. His nickname is old Gimleti. Gimlet is a is a hand drill. It's something that it's a
[00:11:30] tool. It's an old school tool that used to drill wood. So he had this piercing look that he would
[00:11:36] give people. And they called him old Gimleti. Broken service gets out, gets married, has kids, runs a
[00:11:45] coal mine in West Virginia goes back in the Marine Corps. It must have been easy to get down in an
[00:11:50] out of the Marine Corps back then. He does it a couple times. More fighting in Central America,
[00:11:56] the Italian commander in in Nicaragua, fall in the battle of Mazaya, leads the assault,
[00:12:06] the bombardment, the assault, and the capture of Kuyoktepe Hill. Next up is Veracruz. These guys are
[00:12:15] he's rolling. They're getting it on with these low intensity conflicts. I remember one of my old
[00:12:22] senior chief said, what we need is a low intensity conflict in a high per day of Mariah.
[00:12:29] Which I always got a kick out of. So that's where he's got going on. These guys are low intensity
[00:12:34] conflict, high per day of Mariah. Mexico Veracruz first metal of honor. So they end up going through
[00:12:39] Veracruz that kind of clear-knit door to door. There's 5,800 sailors and Marines on this operation.
[00:12:47] 17 kilodin action, 63 wounded in action. Which if you think about that, 5,800 sailors and marines
[00:12:57] are 17 kilodin. So the fighting, I'm trying to say that the fighting wasn't that extreme.
[00:13:02] But there was medals of honor given out. Pretty, pretty, a lot. So one army guy got a metal of honor.
[00:13:16] Nine Marines got a metal of honor and 46 Navy sailors got the metal of honor.
[00:13:21] From this action of Veracruz. So he eventually tried to return the metal and said hey, I didn't
[00:13:27] do anything during this and they, not only did they tell them to keep it, they told them you
[00:13:30] better wear it too. So that's his first metal of honor. He didn't feel comfortable about it.
[00:13:35] But he got it. Haiti, second metal of honor. Fighting the Haitian, the Kaco's rebels,
[00:13:41] the rebel group down there. And they have this stronghold he kind of heard me talk about it in the
[00:13:47] in the citation there. But he's getting the metal of honor. The whole battle was 20 minutes long.
[00:13:55] This assault. There was a one Marine wounded and he was wounded by being hit with a rock in the face.
[00:14:04] All 51 of the rebels were killed. So he got the metal of honor for that.
[00:14:12] And that's what happened. After that he became like a public administrator or sort of sort of
[00:14:18] sort of the military, I don't know, many dictator kind of running things a little bit.
[00:14:24] The public works and keep in things, you know, social order. And he also, it's also said that
[00:14:28] they hunted the remaining rebels like pigs. World War I comes around. He requests, he wants
[00:14:41] to come back again. He had a reputation of being brave. He had a reputation of being smart. He also
[00:14:48] had a reputation of being a little bit of a rebel, a little bit unreliable. And so I don't know if
[00:14:59] that's why they decided not to put him in combat because I'm thinking if World War I, they would
[00:15:03] have been like, oh yeah, you're just the guy we're looking for. He's brave, he's smart, but you're
[00:15:07] super crazy, come on up to the front line, we got something for you. But they didn't. He ended up
[00:15:12] running this debarcation depot, you know, in the rear. And the by all accounts, he did a great job
[00:15:20] and squared this thing away. It was a real mess when he showed up and he squared it away.
[00:15:25] And he got the army in the Navy, distinguished service metal. After that, he goes and he's the
[00:15:32] commanding general, a quannico. When he was the commanding, this guy was always doing something.
[00:15:39] He's one of those people, he always was doing something. When he was the commanding general,
[00:15:43] a quannico, they used to form up the troops and they would march to various battle fields,
[00:15:50] civil war battle fields and do reenactments. And he would lead the marches. So yeah, I mean,
[00:15:58] he's just, they they march from quannico to damgettysburg, right? And he was in front, leading it.
[00:16:05] And they got up there. Let's do walk, get these burgers. So so then he's so gets done with that.
[00:16:12] Now he has a broken service and he becomes the Philadelphia director of public safety.
[00:16:19] And this is like, I need a movie reference here, echo Charles. What's the movie where they're like,
[00:16:27] gangsters, they're trying to crack down untouchables? Sure. Okay. So there's, this is the time,
[00:16:35] there's speak easy, is in the prohibition is going on. And he comes like law dog, right? He comes into,
[00:16:43] he has a personal war on crime for two years. And it seems like when you read about it,
[00:16:48] it seems like it's its own movie, right? This guy is going in just ready to take things on. He
[00:16:55] was, he wasn't allowed to fire. If I remember this correctly, he wasn't allowed, he found out he wasn't
[00:17:00] allowed to fire individual police because the union and whatever. So what he did was he just take and just
[00:17:06] move them all around all the time. So they didn't have, they didn't have time to get to know the
[00:17:10] local criminals to get paid off. He just moved them all the time. They were moving. That's like one of
[00:17:14] the things that he did. And he, he made a lot of enemies because of so many people are corrupt,
[00:17:22] made a bunch of enemies. He's fine. He gets kind a little bit. He did it does it for two years.
[00:17:26] He cleans up a lot of stuff, but also makes a bunch of enemies. His final shot in the papers
[00:17:32] before he went back in the Marine Corps. He's been cleaning up Philadelphia's worse than any
[00:17:37] battle I was ever in. When he comes back in, he comes, comes the base commander in San Diego.
[00:17:45] Deployed with the Marine Expeditionary Force to China, does a good job there politically,
[00:17:52] influences a bunch of people, makes major general at 48 years old. And in that time also,
[00:17:59] his dad died, his dad was super influential. He was like I said, he was always kind of,
[00:18:05] he was kind of had a spotlight put on one of the things when Mussolini's now in power. He,
[00:18:11] and there was some weird, like a conspiracy about Mussolini needed, hitting Ron or something like this,
[00:18:18] I forget, but he sort of spread those rumors. I think if he had Twitter, he would have been
[00:18:25] a real popular Twitter dude because he started spreading this guy, you know, this guy is a murderer.
[00:18:33] And the Italian government, this was before the war, the Italian government, it's like, hey,
[00:18:37] get, get your boy in check and they pressured the second half to court martial butter. And they did,
[00:18:43] they court martial butter. I think he was the highest ranking military person to be arrested
[00:18:51] after the Civil War. So he had arrested and he apologized, they let him off for the reprimand.
[00:18:57] The comment on the Marine Corps died at the time and he was kind of in the running and he ends up,
[00:19:02] it's pretty obvious that he's not enough of a company guy to get common done and he doesn't get it.
[00:19:10] So he retires from the Marine Corps October 1st, 1931. He starts going on like a lecture tour
[00:19:20] speaking and he gets paid for it. He donated a bunch of the pay that he gets for the unemployment
[00:19:26] relief. He runs for Senate. He loses. He supports the bonus army, which was when the World War
[00:19:32] won vets. They had these things called service certificates that they bought. And when they bought
[00:19:39] those things, they had, again, I'm sorry if this isn't perfect, but it was something along the lines
[00:19:46] of when you bought these things, they had like a 20 year maturity time on them. And the depression's
[00:19:54] going on and everyone's like, hey, we want that money and all these veterans, thousands and
[00:19:59] thousands of veterans are saying, hey, we, we, we know we gave you that money. We bought those service
[00:20:03] certificates, which are like bonds. We want to cash them in now. And the government was like,
[00:20:08] hey, those are 20 years, man, you bought those in 19. You got to have another few years before
[00:20:13] you can cash those things in. And this is when they had all the big standoffs in the, you know,
[00:20:18] the World War I veterans marched down and set up camp in Washington, DC. And he supported that,
[00:20:28] gave more speeches. Here's an example. This is when we know where he's had mentally, right?
[00:20:35] I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean, we can see what his angle starts to become. This was,
[00:20:41] and this was a summary of one of his speeches that was published in socialist magazine. That was
[00:20:48] called common sense. It says, I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and
[00:20:53] during that period, I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for big business for Wall Street
[00:20:59] and the bankers. In short, I was a raccade tier, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico
[00:21:06] and especially Tampico, which is a city in Mexico, safe for American oil, as interests in 1914.
[00:21:14] I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank Boys to collect revenues in.
[00:21:20] I helped in the raping of half a dozen central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street.
[00:21:26] I helped purify Nick or Wagua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1902 to 1912.
[00:21:33] I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interest in 1916. I helped
[00:21:39] make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927, I helped
[00:21:45] see to it that standard oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given
[00:21:52] Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was operate his racket in three districts. I operated
[00:21:59] on three continents. He's kind of pissed. 1934, again, this guy would have been all over Twitter.
[00:22:12] 1934, he's sort of the leader of this thing that was called the business plot, which was this
[00:22:18] that there's this conspiracy that there was this plot for business leaders to overthrow
[00:22:23] President Roosevelt. In 1935, he wrote this book called War is a racket.
[00:22:37] Now, we're going to read it. Some of it's extreme. Some of it may be too extreme. Some of it's
[00:22:46] not accurate. Some of it's his feelings, his emotions. You know, when Colonel David Hacworth,
[00:22:59] when he went and talked to the press and you and I have had that discussion day of like
[00:23:08] did he give up his influence? He could have been a division came out of Brigade Commander next
[00:23:11] in the division commander. I think people sometimes reach a point where they emotionally
[00:23:20] can't take it anymore. I think David Hacworth got there where he had seen enough American soldiers
[00:23:27] and he loved his soldiers and he loved all soldiers and he loved the army and just to see
[00:23:33] the soldiers being utilized in a way that he didn't think was to actually sound eventually.
[00:23:36] He just couldn't take anymore. And I think that Major General Smedley Butler got to a similar point.
[00:23:48] And of course, this is 1935. So I mean, we got hit learn power in 1933. So he sees,
[00:23:54] though he hears the war drums beating and as he sees the war drums beating, he doesn't like it.
[00:24:00] What do you thought so far, Dave? It's interesting to hear you recount some things that I
[00:24:08] remember, because obviously as a Marine, this is one of the characters in the history of the
[00:24:14] Marine Corps that you are given early on. So they give it, they give you Smedley Butler really
[00:24:19] on. Oh yeah. Is there, is there not risking that? Aren't they like, well,
[00:24:24] the weird thing was that we're at the metal of honors, right? Look, I'm in no position to be like,
[00:24:29] well, I'm not sure. But when 46 Navy sailors got a metal of honor and there's 17 kilodin action.
[00:24:37] Like that's a, that that seems very, that seems, that seems strange. Yeah. Right. For sure.
[00:24:46] Seems strange. And that's the, that's really kind of the point that I'm thinking about in my mind is,
[00:24:52] you know, there's a little bit of a contrast. This is a guy that you will hear about. And certainly
[00:24:58] in, and listen, you could, I mean, I got to be careful with my words too, because I don't want
[00:25:03] there to be a negative connotation to it. But there's a, there's an indoctrination you go through
[00:25:06] in your Marine. And that indoctrination is, we're kind of awesome. And our history is pretty awesome.
[00:25:12] And we've got some amazing people that did some amazing things. And you start to think about who those
[00:25:15] people are. One of the things that's interesting about the name Smedley Butler is when you see the
[00:25:20] pictures of this guy. And like, you'll be in a class and it'll be about Marine Corps history. And they'll
[00:25:24] literally have a slide or a picture up on the wall of the person. And he's not, he doesn't really
[00:25:30] look like a, a, I guess. He looks like poster boy Marine. He looks like a guy named Smedley. He does.
[00:25:36] And that went to maybe a private school. This coast. And then, you know, you're, you're seeing
[00:25:42] basilone and you're seeing chesty and these pictures. And just the pictures alone are enough to be like,
[00:25:46] okay, this, this dude is legit. But, you know, they also, I don't have any recollection of
[00:25:53] the things that he did and the times that he did them and there awards. I don't ever remember
[00:25:58] being given sort of the other side of it is, hey, listen, there's a different time, different circumstances.
[00:26:03] So as I hear you talk about that and I'm listening to that, I just did some basic math, you know,
[00:26:08] 5,600 people and then you sort of did that W wounded and killed him like, well, I've seen that.
[00:26:13] I know what the middle or more of the other side of that looks like and those numbers are good numbers.
[00:26:18] You know, by by Sanders, like you said, this is probably not the most high intensity thing
[00:26:23] that that that that marines have been through. But the other side is is this is also, I'm
[00:26:29] literally, you just say he's 40 years old as a major general. This guy went back in the Marine Corps twice.
[00:26:33] This guy had a left high school and by rights, kind of probably just coasted on a pretty easy life.
[00:26:40] So you're kind of forced to reconcile and remind that I think to maybe the whole point of this podcast
[00:26:46] is that I probably need to listen to what he has to say. But yeah, no, he's, he is one of
[00:26:52] the characters that and I'm using that term just, you know, to illustrate that we are introduced
[00:26:56] to historic marines that have had impact in history and that's someone that we know about for sure.
[00:27:03] We could probably do a whole podcast about awards and whatnot, but I forget what year,
[00:27:09] like the bronze star and the silver star, it wasn't, they didn't have those yet at this time.
[00:27:13] Yeah. And so this was, if you were going to get an award, it was going to be the metal of water.
[00:27:16] And there you go. Again, it's, it's like crazy because you got this guy that has two metal,
[00:27:24] two metals of honor and this Marine Corps prevent thing, which there's, there's not many of those things
[00:27:29] handed out either. It's a tiny number. And, and also the type of combat that they were going into,
[00:27:36] I mean, this is pre-World War I, it's the combat that he's talking about. So combat was totally different
[00:27:43] between, you know what, I mean, you got the silver war, we knew what combat was, but, but,
[00:27:51] yeah, there've been, there've been a generation maybe that was a little bit,
[00:27:55] that that hadn't quite been there. Yeah, and I think the sense that I've always had
[00:28:00] was that that when you think of conflict or you think of combat and you think of World War I,
[00:28:06] it has a very strong sense of organized conflict between two well-established, well-organized
[00:28:11] size, a size that have design and structure and and components that you can almost align against each other.
[00:28:18] And that, certainly for World War I, produces probably like the most heavy intensity of conflict.
[00:28:24] Whereas before that, you have this sense of this well-organized team, the United States Navy,
[00:28:29] the United States Marine Corps, the organization of those two working together, we're, we're going
[00:28:34] to get you to the beach, you're going to embark and you're going to, or, or debark and get onto the
[00:28:37] land, and we're going to support you and, but the, the people you're in conflict with, you don't have
[00:28:44] that level of organization. So when you said, you know, one wounded on the good side in 57
[00:28:49] kiln, I'm like, I can, and again, I should be careful wounded by a rock, but you can picture that,
[00:28:55] like, this is a lot cited scenario. And it doesn't mean that that weren't incredibly brave
[00:29:00] actions that didn't happen to, it's solicit that outcome, but when you think of World War I,
[00:29:04] or World War II, or really conflicts we've had since then that organized versus organized,
[00:29:08] you don't get those sense of that long period of, of Marine Corps history, and those are all in
[00:29:12] Marine Corps history. We, we learn about all those things, but you don't get a sense of this
[00:29:17] force on force conflict that were in the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[00:29:22] World War I, World War II, we're going against someone that's pretty much like we are.
[00:29:26] Professionally trained professionally outfitted and prepared for for this type of conflict.
[00:29:30] Check. So he writes his book wars a racket and people people, I, I don't know, I've had this book for five years.
[00:29:38] In fact, I couldn't even find, I have two copies of it, and I haven't, I wouldn't be able to find them.
[00:29:42] So you can get this thing on PDF. And the reason I couldn't find them is because the moving scenario,
[00:29:48] I'm going to come up there and sell my books or in big giant boxes. And I was like, it's time to do it.
[00:29:53] And yeah, what, what makes it time to do it, because, well, one of the things that just
[00:29:57] totally provoked me was a trillion dollar price tag on Afghanistan and thousands of lives lost.
[00:30:06] And you're thinking, hold on a second. Who, what was, what was the overall goal here?
[00:30:12] What we're doing? Because if I, I could spend a trillion dollars and do literally anything,
[00:30:17] you can maybe a trillion dollars, a trillion dollars. You're telling me you couldn't square away a
[00:30:24] country with a trillion dollars and 20 years. And basically an unlimited supply of people and assets.
[00:30:32] It's crazy. So what was going on? So as I'm thinking about that, here I am, a guy that supports
[00:30:39] the military that is very patriotic. And I'm thinking, who spends a trillion dollars?
[00:30:47] And it doesn't, doesn't get the job done. How does that happen? Who are you? What are you thinking
[00:30:53] about? What is your ultimate goal? And that very quickly, my mind very quickly jumped on,
[00:31:00] oh, this is probably what's medley, smelly, but now I'd read wars a racket.
[00:31:04] I was always kind of like, yeah, well, yeah, I mean, that's one way of looking at it, right?
[00:31:08] So let's look at it. Here we go. Chapter one, wars a racket. It always has been.
[00:31:15] It's possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only
[00:31:21] one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars
[00:31:28] and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it
[00:31:36] seems to be to the majority of the people. Only a small inside group knows what it's about.
[00:31:43] It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many out of war,
[00:31:53] a few people make huge fortunes. Okay. If we're just going to fact check this thing as we go,
[00:32:02] so far we are factual, right? That's what a racket is, right? A racket is something where a
[00:32:08] couple of people kind of know what's going on, everything else is getting fooled. A couple of people
[00:32:12] inside are going to make a bunch of money. Other people are kind of going to get screwed. That's what's
[00:32:16] going to happen. In war, there are people that make a lot of money. He calls it the World War because
[00:32:27] there was only one at the time. In the World War, a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict.
[00:32:34] At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the
[00:32:40] World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains, or sorry, that many admitted their huge blood
[00:32:48] gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns?
[00:32:55] No one knows. Okay. So a lot of people made a lot of money in the world. I just saw an article that
[00:33:02] there's several billion dollars in taxes that are avoided by the top 1% earners in this country.
[00:33:13] So other people that are doing things to get around taxes, yes. Where are there people that were
[00:33:19] made into millionaires and billionaires after September 11th? Yes, there were.
[00:33:25] Next, how many of these war millionaires shoulder to rifle? How many of them dug a trench?
[00:33:37] How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat and fested dug out? How many of them
[00:33:42] spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets?
[00:33:47] How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy? How many of them were wounded or killed
[00:33:56] in battle?
[00:34:01] Ratorical questions that I think we all know the answer to.
[00:34:07] Not many.
[00:34:08] Out of war, nations acquire additional territory. If they are victorious, they just take it.
[00:34:19] This newly acquired territory is exploited by the few. The self-same few who run dollars out
[00:34:27] of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the bill.
[00:34:31] Fact check. Kind of negative on this one. I mean America speaking of America,
[00:34:44] we have kind of our established what we have territory was and we haven't taken any new territory
[00:34:54] in recent wars. That's not been our goal. Even the idea that oh, it's going in there to take the oil.
[00:35:04] We don't actually go in and take the oil. It hasn't happened.
[00:35:14] And what is the bill? This bill renders a horrible accounting.
[00:35:19] Newly placed gravestones, mangled bodies, shattered minds, broken hearts and homes,
[00:35:27] economic instability, depression and all its attendant miseries,
[00:35:32] backbreaking taxation for generations and generations.
[00:35:42] Factual feature.
[00:35:43] Horrible accounting.
[00:35:53] And taxation to pay for these wars for generations.
[00:36:01] For a great many years as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket.
[00:36:06] Not until I retired to civil life that I fully realized it.
[00:36:09] Now that I see the international war clouds gathering as they are today, I must face it and speak out.
[00:36:17] And again, that's because he's looking at world war two. What you call the war clouds.
[00:36:22] Again, they are choosing sides. France and Russia met and agreed to stand by side by side.
[00:36:28] Italy and Austria are hurried to make a similar agreement. Poland and Germany cast
[00:36:32] cast, cast sheep's eyes at each other, forgetting for the nons their dispute over the Polish quarter.
[00:36:40] And to look what nons was. It means like a one time deal.
[00:36:47] Just hey, we're just going to forget about our dispute over here because we're going to be friends right now.
[00:36:53] The assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia complicated matters. Yugoslavia and Hungary,
[00:36:59] Hungary, long bitter enemies were almost at each other's throats. Italy was ready to jump in,
[00:37:04] but France was waiting. So it was Czechoslovakia. All of them are looking ahead to war.
[00:37:09] Not the people. Not those who fight and pay and die, only those who foment wars and remain
[00:37:16] safely at home to profit.
[00:37:19] What are you got? You get a fact check that. No, no, no, no.
[00:37:33] Yeah, yeah. I'm kind of sitting here listening to you talk, which is his word.
[00:37:39] You read this before? No, I have not. So that's why this is like a it's hard.
[00:37:43] Is it hard? And so I'm not wrote down a bunch of different notes.
[00:37:46] The last one I just wrote down was was just literally the word angry.
[00:37:52] I don't think you're trying to convey that emotion on purpose. It's literally the words that you are
[00:37:56] reading. If you just if you try to put yourself in his shoes and I was just kind of recounting.
[00:38:02] We were talking about low intensity conflict and maybe the things that happened up until prior to
[00:38:07] warmer one. And I did think of something after I was talking a minute ago about the word low
[00:38:13] intensity conflict. I do remember the first time I was shot at like for real. And
[00:38:21] there's a moment when you're the one who is you know the victim or the potential victim here
[00:38:26] it feels like World War III because when you're the one being shot it doesn't really matter
[00:38:29] the scope of what's going around you. That sends things like, oh damn, those people are trying
[00:38:34] to kill me and they're actually pretty darn close. You don't say, well, you know, in the grand scheme
[00:38:40] of historical things this is a very low intensity conflict and this particular engagement isn't.
[00:38:44] You don't think like that you think, okay, this is a big deal. There's a huge deal. And then
[00:38:49] with you, if you observe that and you're in his shoes and you lead up to the Travis deal over
[00:38:54] one, I'm just trying to be empathetic to the level of frustration you would have at the hands of
[00:39:01] a few number of decision makers both military and civilian by the way when we talk about
[00:39:05] over one. It's not hard for me to try to understand that as he said, I'm just almost pictureing
[00:39:12] him writing this down and just the frustration and the anger that he has and how clearly that's
[00:39:18] coming through and hearing you say his, the words that he's saying that it's hard not to get a sense
[00:39:24] of his frustration. And you've even talked about how hard this is it when you just kind of boil over,
[00:39:29] you're not able to really even articulate yourself. I don't mean to say correctly, but
[00:39:34] the way that you would normally want to when you can keep your emotions in check.
[00:39:37] Yeah. Which you can't. Yeah, I know you got to you found it very interesting when we did,
[00:39:43] when we talked about being a child heart, just the fact like once you realized he was in the
[00:39:47] battle of the song, you're like, oh, got it. Okay. So this guy has a totally different perspective
[00:39:53] which is completely grounded and and fermented in what he experienced on the battlefield. And yeah,
[00:40:02] this is, uh, yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a similar, a similar deal.
[00:40:10] Moving on, there are 40 million men under arms in the world today. So this again, this is 1935.
[00:40:15] And our statesmen and diplomats have the temerity to say that war is not in the making.
[00:40:21] Hell's bells are these 40 million men being trained to be dancers.
[00:40:26] Not immediately to be sure. Premier Moosellini knows what they are being trained for.
[00:40:31] He, at least, is frank enough to speak out. Only the other day, he'll do J in international
[00:40:36] consolation, the publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said quote,
[00:40:43] and above all, fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity
[00:40:49] quite apart from political considerations of the moment believes neither in the possibility nor the
[00:40:56] utility of perpetual peace. War alone brings up to its highest tension, all human energy and
[00:41:04] puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it. And quote,
[00:41:14] that's a, it's one thing for Ronald Reagan to say peace through strength and hey, we've got
[00:41:22] to be strong and we've got to, you know, the best way to avoid war is to be prepared for it.
[00:41:26] But when you got Moosellini to say, hey, there's, I don't believe in the possibility or the
[00:41:32] or the freaking utility of peace. War alone brings to its highest tension, all human energy,
[00:41:41] and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it.
[00:41:45] That's the leader of your country. Guess what's happening? You're going to war in a war.
[00:41:48] On doubtily, Moosellini means exactly what he says. His well-trained army, his great fleet of
[00:41:56] planes, and even his navy are ready for war, anxious for it, apparently. His recent stand at the
[00:42:03] side of Hungary in the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia showed that, and the hurried mobilization
[00:42:08] of troops on the Austrian border after the assassination of Dolphus showed it too.
[00:42:13] There are others in Europe who's saber-rattling, presages, war, sooner or later.
[00:42:22] Paritler, with his rearming Germany and his constant demands for more and more arms,
[00:42:28] is an equal if not greater metastopiece. France only recently increased the turn of military
[00:42:33] service for its youth from a year to 18 months. All this stuff is going on, he's just tracking it.
[00:42:39] He sees everybody's head and head in the war.
[00:42:46] Yes, all over nations are camping in their arms. The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose. In the
[00:42:52] Orient, the maneuvering is more a joy. Back in 1904, when Russia and Japan fought, we kicked our
[00:42:57] old friends, the Russians, and back to PAN. Then our very generous international bankers were financing
[00:43:03] Japan. Now the trend is too poison us against the Japanese. What does the open door policy
[00:43:09] to China mean to us? Our trade with China is about $90 million a year. Or the Philippine Islands.
[00:43:15] We have spent about $600 million in the Philippines in 35 years. And we, our bankers and industrialists
[00:43:22] and speculators, have private investments there of less than $200 million.
[00:43:29] Then to save China, to save that China trade of about $90 million and to protect these private
[00:43:34] investments of less than 200 in the Philippines, we would all be stirred up to hate Japan and go to war.
[00:43:40] A war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of American
[00:43:46] lives, and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men.
[00:43:56] Of course, for this loss, there would be a compensating profit. Forchants would be made,
[00:44:01] millions and billions of dollars would be piled up by a few. Munitions makers, bankers, ship builders,
[00:44:10] manufacturers, meat packers, speculators, they would fare well.
[00:44:19] Yes, they are getting ready for another war. Why shouldn't they? They pay high dividends.
[00:44:25] But what does it profit the men who are killed? What does it profit their mothers and sisters?
[00:44:29] Their wives and their sweethearts? What does it profit their children? What does it profit?
[00:44:34] Anyone except the very few to whom war means huge profits? Yes, and what does it profit the nation?
[00:44:43] So, I kind of have my thoughts on all this that I'm going to say a little bit.
[00:45:03] What's the, I would say the methodology of the argument that he's presenting is to show
[00:45:11] one side of the argument, which is a good argument. You can't really come out this argument.
[00:45:21] You can't say, well, people aren't going to make money. People make money. That's what happens.
[00:45:31] And that by itself is it automatically a bad thing either? That's true. That's the other part.
[00:45:36] That's what I'm saying because there's, I know you've got thoughts on this. You're not going to be careful.
[00:45:40] I could probably chime in like I usually do an every single thing that says, there's thoughts going through my head.
[00:45:43] Crazy. Yes. I mean, there are profit here and there are people that profit.
[00:45:49] And if I'm using the terms correctly, you can distinguish between those two.
[00:45:53] Right. And they can be aligned for sure. I mean, it's easy for me to sit here on retrospect,
[00:46:00] but it's like, hey, Hitler, Mussolini? Yeah, we probably want to go to all those people.
[00:46:03] Yeah. Now, not let them do what they want. That's not a good plan.
[00:46:07] And I know this now sitting here looking back. But you're right. And I think to your point,
[00:46:15] his perspective is correct. It's not the whole story, but it's a perspective that what he sees
[00:46:21] and the way he's presenting it is correct. Yes. It's just that there is more tears more. And as
[00:46:26] you said, there's nothing more obvious than that than a guy named Edolph Hitler. Right. That's about to go
[00:46:32] on a tear and kill millions of people. And it's interesting he's using him like, hey, he might be worse than
[00:46:37] this other guy. Yeah, he might be. Yeah, in 1935, he didn't seem so bad compared to Mussolini.
[00:46:43] He's going to give a little example. It's simply to take our own case.
[00:46:47] Until until 1898, we didn't own a bit of territory outside the mainland of North America.
[00:46:52] At that time, our national debt was little more than a billion dollars. Then we became
[00:46:56] internationally minded. We forgot or shunted aside the advice of the father of our country.
[00:47:01] We forgot George Washington's warning about entangling alliances. We went to war.
[00:47:06] We acquired outside territory at the end of the World War period. As a direct result of our
[00:47:12] fiddling and international affairs, our national debt had jumped to over 25 billion.
[00:47:19] Our total favorable trade balance during the 25-year period was about 24 billion.
[00:47:24] Therefore, on a purely bookkeeping basis, we ran a little behind year for year,
[00:47:31] and that foreign trade might as well have been ours without the wars.
[00:47:38] Again, when you just look at the numbers, run the numbers,
[00:47:42] man, we were a billion dollars and that debt and now we're 25 billion dollars and debt, that hurts.
[00:47:48] It would have been far cheaper not to say safer for the average American who pays the bills
[00:47:55] to stay out of foreign entanglements. For a very few this racket like bootlegging and other
[00:48:01] underworld rackets brings fancy profits, but the cost of operations is always transferred to the
[00:48:07] people who do not profit. And now we get into chapter two, who makes the profits.
[00:48:12] The World War, rather our brief participation in it, has cost the United States some $52 billion
[00:48:20] figured out. That means $400 to every American man, woman, and child. And we haven't paid the debt yet.
[00:48:27] We are paying it. Our children will pay it and our children's children probably still will be paying
[00:48:32] the cost of that war. The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are 6,
[00:48:38] 8, 10 and sometimes 12 percent. But wartime profits. Ah, that is another matter.
[00:48:44] 20, 60, 100, 300 and even 1,800 percent. The sky is the limit. All that traffic will bear.
[00:48:53] Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in wartime.
[00:49:02] It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and quote,
[00:49:07] we must all put our shoulders to the wheel. But the profits jump and leap and skyrocket
[00:49:14] and our safely pocketed. Let's just take a few examples. Take our friends, the DuPontz, the
[00:49:18] powder people. Didn't warn them testified before a Senate committee recently that their powder
[00:49:24] won the war or saved the world or saved the world for democracy or something. How did they do in
[00:49:29] the war? They were a patriotic corporation. Well, the average earnings of the DuPontz for the period
[00:49:35] of 1910 to 1914 was $6 million a year. It wasn't much, but the DuPontz managed to get along.
[00:49:43] Now let's look at their average dearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918.
[00:49:48] $58 million a profit a year we find. Nearly 10 times that of normal times and the profits of normal
[00:49:56] times were pretty good. An increase of profits more than 950 percent.
[00:50:01] Take one of our little steel companies that patrioticly shunted aside the making of rails and
[00:50:09] girders and bridges to manufacture war materials. Well, their 1910 to 1914 yearly earnings average
[00:50:15] $6 million then came the war. And like loyal citizens, Bethlehem steel promptly turned to
[00:50:20] mission munitions making. Did their profits jump or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain?
[00:50:28] Well, their 1914 to 1918 average was $49 million a year. Or let's take United Steel.
[00:50:35] Normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year, not bad.
[00:50:40] Then came along the war and up with the profits. The average yearly profit for the period
[00:50:45] 1914 to 1918 was $240 million, not bad. Then you have some of the steel and powder earnings.
[00:50:52] Let's look at something else. A little copper perhaps. That always does well in wartimes
[00:50:57] and a condo for instance. Average yearly earnings during the previous pre-year wars of 1910 to
[00:51:02] 1914 to 1918. During the war, you wore years, 1914 to 1918. Prophets left to $34 million a year.
[00:51:10] You talk copper. average of $5 million during the pre-war period. Jump to an average of 21 million
[00:51:16] yearly profits for the war period. Let's group these five with three similar companies. The total
[00:51:23] yearly average profits of the pre-war period 1910 to 1914 were $137 million. Then came along the war.
[00:51:32] The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408 million. A little increase in profits
[00:51:39] of approximately 200%. There's war pay. They paid them. But they aren't the only ones. They're
[00:51:47] still others. Let's take leather. For three-year period, before the war, the total profit of
[00:51:54] central leather company were $3.5 million. That was approximately $1.16 million a year. Well,
[00:52:02] in 1916 central leather returned to profit of $15 million. Small increase of 1,100%. That's all.
[00:52:09] A general chemical company averaged a profit for three years before the war of a little over
[00:52:14] $800,000 a year. Came the war and profits jumped to $12 million a year. I'll leave a $1,400.
[00:52:21] International nickel company. You can't have a war without nickel. Show it an increase in profits
[00:52:25] from a mere $4 million a year to $73 million a year. Not bad. An increase of $1,700.
[00:52:33] American sugar refining company averaged $2 million a year for three years before the war in
[00:52:37] the 1916 a profit of $6 million was recorded. Listen to Senate document number 259,
[00:52:44] the 65th Congress reporting on corporate earnings and government revenues, considering the
[00:52:50] profits of 122 meat packers, 153 cotton manufacturer, 299 garment makers, 49 steel plants,
[00:52:57] 340 coal producers during the war. Profits under 25% were exceptional. For instance, the coal
[00:53:05] companies made between 100% and 7,800% on their capital stock during a war. The Chicago Packers
[00:53:13] doubled and tripled their earnings. Let us not forget the bankers who financed the great war.
[00:53:17] If anyone had the cream of the profits, it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than
[00:53:22] incorporated organizations, they did not have to report to stockholders and their profits
[00:53:27] were as secret as they were immense. How the bankers made their millions and billions. I do not
[00:53:32] know because those little secrets never become public even before a Senate investor, investor,
[00:53:38] retiree body. People make money. Part of that is supply and demand. One of the reasons
[00:53:51] that America does so well during war is because we have capitalism and that's how we're able
[00:53:56] to outprose other countries, especially companies that have socialized or communist controlled
[00:54:06] industry. They just can't do what we do. Why? Because they're not driven to do it. There's no,
[00:54:11] hey, look, I'm running this factory for whatever for the Soviet Union. They want me to make 100
[00:54:17] tanks. They want me to make 200 tanks. I'm going to get the same paycheck. Regardless.
[00:54:20] And if I'm a guy, whatever, working on the fabrication of one of those tank trades, I don't
[00:54:27] care if I make 20 today or if I make 100 today, I'm going to get the same paycheck.
[00:54:33] So these people are going to make a lot of money because they're going to turn out
[00:54:38] something that is in high demand. Here's how some other patriotic industrialists and speculators
[00:54:48] chiseled their way into war profits. Take the shoe people. They like war. It brings business with
[00:54:54] abnormal profits. They made huge profits and sales abroad to our allies. Perhaps like the
[00:54:59] munitions manufacturers and armament makers, they also sold to the enemy. For a dollar as a
[00:55:05] dollar weather comes from Germany or from France. But they did well by Uncle Sam too. For instance,
[00:55:10] they sold Uncle Sam 35 million pairs of hobnailed service shoes. So that's a big number
[00:55:18] there were 4 million soldiers, 8 pairs or more to a soldier. My regiment during the war had only
[00:55:25] one pair to soldier. Per soldier. Some of these shoes probably are still in existence. They were
[00:55:30] good shoes. But when the war was over, Uncle Sam has a matter of 25 million pairs of shoes left over,
[00:55:36] bought and paid for a profits recorded and pocketed. And this is, you know, you start getting
[00:55:41] into the idea of just like the government waste and it's just the crazy, crazy government waste.
[00:55:46] Which is why the free market is so powerful because people try and streamline things.
[00:55:55] There was a lot of leather left so the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands
[00:55:59] of McLeodland saddles for the cavalry. But there wasn't any American cavalry overseas.
[00:56:04] Somebody had to get rid of this leather, however, somebody had to make a profit in it so we had a lot
[00:56:09] of McLeodland saddles. We probably still do. Also, somebody made a lot of mosquito netting. They sold
[00:56:16] Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of soldiers overseas. I suppose the boys were expected
[00:56:21] to put it over them as they tried to sleep and muddy trenches. One hand scratching kudies on their
[00:56:26] backs and the others making passes at scurrying rats. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to
[00:56:31] France. Anyhow, these thoughtful manufacturers wanted to make sure that no soldier would be
[00:56:37] without his mosquito net. So 40 million additional yards in mosquito netting were sold, Uncle Sam.
[00:56:42] You know why? Because you're not spending your own money. You're not spending your own money.
[00:56:49] You're not spending your own money, man. You spend it on stuff. Because it's really easy to
[00:56:55] you know what they might need them. No, let's get them. And all politics are local and who knows
[00:57:02] who was putting in those where those mosquito nets were made. These were pretty good profits
[00:57:09] in mosquito netting in those days. Even if there were no mosquitoes in France. I suppose if the
[00:57:12] ward lasted just a little bit longer, the enterprising mosquito netting manufacturers would have
[00:57:16] sold Uncle Sam a couple of consignments of mosquitoes to plant in France so that more mosquito netting
[00:57:20] would be in order. Airplane and air and engine manufacturers felt they too should adjust their
[00:57:27] profits out of this ward. Why not? Everybody else is getting theirs. So a billion dollars. Count them
[00:57:32] if you live long enough with spend by Uncle Sam and building airplane engines that never left
[00:57:36] the ground. Not one plane or motor out of the billion dollars worth ordered ever got in a battle in
[00:57:42] France. Just the same the manufacturers made their little profit of 30, 100 or perhaps 300%.
[00:57:53] Remember the fraud wasting abuse hotline? Apparently they didn't have that. Like in the military
[00:57:57] echo Charles they got to think called the fraud wasting abuse hotline. You call up and say hey
[00:58:02] we're buying plane engines. We got them lined up. We're not using them. We're buying mosquito nets.
[00:58:08] We're not using them. Did anyone actually use that? Or do you know of anyone who I never
[00:58:13] used it? Did you ever use it? I never used it but I know the sticker. I know if I would
[00:58:18] had to use that. Probably to use it on my task and my platoon for the money we were wasting on
[00:58:22] ammunition. Just slaying ammunition. Under shirts four soldiers cost 14 cents to make an
[00:58:31] uncle Sam paid 30 to 40 cents each for them a nice little profit for the underserved
[00:58:34] manufacturer and the stocking manufacturing and the uniform manufacturers and the cap
[00:58:37] manufacturing and the steel helmet manufacturers all got theirs. Why when the war was over
[00:58:43] some four million sets of equipment. Nap Saxon and the things that go to fill them
[00:58:46] crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have
[00:58:50] changed the contents but the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them
[00:58:54] and they will do it all over again next time. There were lots of brilliant ideas
[00:59:00] for making profit during the war. One very versatile Patriot sold uncle Sam 12 does in 48
[00:59:06] inchorrentes. Oh they were very nice wrenches. The only trouble was that there was only one nut
[00:59:11] ever made that was large enough for these wrenches. That's the one that holds the turbines at
[00:59:15] Niagara Falls. Well after uncle Sam had bought them and manufactured and the manufacturer
[00:59:21] profited from them the wrenches were put on freight cars and shunted all around the United
[00:59:24] States in an effort to find a use for them. When the armistice was signed it was indeed a
[00:59:29] sad blow to the wrenches manufacturer. He was just about to make some nuts to fit the runches.
[00:59:34] Then he planned to sell those to your uncle Sam. Still another brilliant idea that the
[00:59:40] Colonel shouldn't ride an automobile. Nor should they even ride on horseback. One has probably
[00:59:46] seen a picture of Andy Jackson riding on a buckboard. Well some 6,000 buckboards were sold the
[00:59:51] uncle Sam for the use by Colonel's not one of them was used. The buckboard manufacturer got his war
[00:59:58] profit. Buckboard is like a wagon. It's like a carriage with leaf springs to be told behind a horse
[01:00:05] 6,000 of them. The ship builders felt they should come on on some of it too. They built a lot of
[01:00:14] ships that they made a lot of profit more than $3 billion worth. Some of the ships were all right.
[01:00:19] But 635 million worth of them were made of wood that wouldn't float. The seams opened up and they
[01:00:25] sank. We paid for them though and somebody pocketed the profits. It's been estimated by status
[01:00:29] titions and economists and researchers that the war cost your uncle Sam 52 billion dollars.
[01:00:35] Of this sum 39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This 6 manager yielded 16
[01:00:42] billion dollars in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way.
[01:00:50] This 16 billion dollars in profits is not to be sneezed at it's quite a tidy sum and it went to a very
[01:00:56] few. The Senate committee probe of the munitions industry and its wartime profits despite its
[01:01:02] sensational closers hardly had scratched the surface. Even so it's had some effect. The state
[01:01:09] department had been studying for some time methods of keeping out of war. The war department suddenly
[01:01:14] decides it has a wonderful plan to spring. The administration names a committee with the war
[01:01:18] navy departments abley represented under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator to limit
[01:01:24] profits in wartime. To what extent isn't suggested? Hmm. Possibly the profits of 306,600
[01:01:33] of those who turned blood into gold in World War in the World War would be limited to some
[01:01:39] smaller figure. Apparently however the plan does not call for any limitation of losses. That is the
[01:01:46] loss losses of those who fight the war. As far as I have been able to ascertain there is nothing in
[01:01:53] this scheme to limit a soldier to the loss of but one eye or one arm or to limit his wounds to one
[01:01:59] or two or three or to limit the loss of life. There's nothing in this scheme apparently that says
[01:02:06] not more than 12% of a regiment shall be wounded in battle or not more than 7% of a division shall
[01:02:11] be killed. Of course the committee cannot be bothered with such trifling matters. So they put together
[01:02:20] a committee and say well you know they're making a little too much money. We should put a limit on how
[01:02:23] much money they can make. Possibly limit those war profits. Chapter 3, who pays the bills?
[01:02:38] Who provides the profits these nice little profits of 20, 100, 3,500, 1,500, 1,800%. We all pay them.
[01:02:47] In taxation we paid the bankers their profits when we bought liberty bonds at $100 and sold them
[01:02:54] back at 84 or 86 to the bankers. These bankers collected $100 plus it was a simple manipulation.
[01:03:03] The bankers control the security marks. It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds.
[01:03:09] Then all of us the people got frightened and sold the bonds at 84 or 86. The bankers bought them.
[01:03:15] Then the same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par and above and then the
[01:03:21] bankers collected their profits. But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.
[01:03:29] If you don't believe this visit the American Cemeteries on the battlefield abroad.
[01:03:37] Or visit any of the veterans hospitals in the United States.
[01:03:42] On a tour of the country in the midst of which I am I am doing at the time of writing this,
[01:03:47] I have visited 18 government hospitals for veterans.
[01:03:52] In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men.
[01:03:56] Men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago.
[01:04:01] The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital at Milwaukee where there are 3,800 of the
[01:04:08] living dead told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home.
[01:04:17] So this was interesting because we hear a lot about what happens when we come home. We hear about PTSD.
[01:04:24] And you see like the images of shell shock in World War II, especially in England and the Brits.
[01:04:32] You don't hear a lot about it from World War I.
[01:04:35] And this is a weirdly written sentence. I tried to read it in a way that made it made sense.
[01:04:42] But it says the very able surgeon, the very able chief surgeon at the government hospital,
[01:04:46] semi colon at Milwaukee where there are 3,800 of the living dead told me that the mortality among veterans
[01:04:54] is three times as great as among those who stayed at home. So what he's saying is people that fought
[01:04:59] are three times likely to die. Three times more likely to die than someone that didn't fight.
[01:05:06] Doesn't talk about how, but my guess is a lot of those are suicide.
[01:05:10] Or just like the crazy violent deaths that military people that have that experience end up having.
[01:05:22] And here he goes into it a little bit. In the most simplistic and so obvious way.
[01:05:31] Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the fields and offices in factories and classrooms
[01:05:38] and put into the ranks. They were remolded. They were made over. They were made to about face
[01:05:48] to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put shoulder to shoulder and through mass
[01:05:55] psychology. They were entirely changed. We used them for a couple of years and trained them to think
[01:06:03] nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then suddenly we discharged them and told them to
[01:06:13] make another about face. This time they had to do their own re-adjustment without mass psychology,
[01:06:21] without officers aid and advice and without nationwide propaganda. We didn't need them anymore.
[01:06:29] So we scattered them about with any three-minute or liberty-loan speeches or without any three-minute
[01:06:38] or liberty-loan speeches or parades. Many too many of these fine young boys are eventually
[01:06:45] destroyed mentally because they could not make that final about face alone.
[01:06:50] That's pretty straightforward. And he gives up, example here he says, in the government hospital
[01:07:03] in Marion, Indiana, 1,800 of these boys are in pens. 500 of them in a barracks with steel bars
[01:07:13] and wires all around the outside of the buildings and on the porches. These already have been
[01:07:19] mentally destroyed. These boys don't even look like human beings. Oh, the look on their faces.
[01:07:26] Physically they are in good shape. Mentally, they are gone.
[01:07:34] There are thousands and thousands of these cases and more and more are coming in all the time.
[01:07:40] The tremendous excitement of the war, the sudden cutting off of that excitement,
[01:07:44] the young boys couldn't stand it. I'm going to have to dig into that and I have to get some
[01:07:54] research going on that because that sounds horrific. 1800, 1800 men boys, he's calling them, but
[01:08:07] this is 1935, the war ended in 1918. So these are young men and you just don't hear about this.
[01:08:21] Hear about it now. You don't hear about it for World War One.
[01:08:28] And in fact World War II, I've talked about well, you know World War II, you got to come
[01:08:32] home on a ship with some other guys and you got to decompress for five or six weeks and you
[01:08:37] held up as a hero and all this stuff and that's why it was easier to adapt. It's like,
[01:08:41] well, what about World War I? And that freaking psychotic war.
[01:08:51] Yeah, I mean, everything that's in my mind obviously has to be tempered with the fact that I truly
[01:08:56] cannot claim to appreciate the reality that he is describing. He said he's been basically talking
[01:09:04] about VA hospitals. He's been 18 different VA hospitals. This is a passion for him. He's going around
[01:09:08] seeing what's going on. And at least in this sense of when you think about World War II that there
[01:09:18] was this, and I got to assume it was felt at the time, it's very clear sense of good and evil,
[01:09:25] right and wrong and the sides that we are on and the justification and the necessity, the global
[01:09:34] necessity. And if you think about World War I, at least try to reconcile the loss and what was it
[01:09:38] for and what was really at stake and how much blurrier, you don't feel that in World War I and
[01:09:46] you talk about probably a nation that's just totally ill equipped to have a 25-year-old come
[01:09:49] back after seeing what they saw without even being able to say, hey, I at least saved the world, you know,
[01:09:57] from Holocaust or nuclear war, whatever it could have been at stake by the end of World War II,
[01:10:04] and being totally ill equipped to know how to even handle that. At least in modern times,
[01:10:13] right, you're at least a little bit desensitized, right? You're seeing horror movies, you're
[01:10:19] seeing blood and guts, you're playing first person shooter video games. Like this is, can you imagine
[01:10:24] coming from freaking Omaha, Nebraska where you're like going to school? You know, I mean, you're just
[01:10:31] a normal kid. That might not even be the best example, because at least in Omaha, Nebraska,
[01:10:36] you're your slaughter and pigs, you're shooting guns, but if you're in whatever, if you're from
[01:10:42] the city and you're just not around that, you're not seeing it. And then boom, you're thrown
[01:10:47] into World War I. And there was another section that he did that that I know about, Smellie Butler.
[01:10:55] There was a point, I think it was when he was in China where he, for the first time saw like
[01:11:00] mass slaughtered Japanese, and it just one of those points that he had seen some real
[01:11:07] violence, and that was before World War I. But yeah, at least nowadays, this might be a bad thing.
[01:11:14] Is that people are desensitized somewhat, you know, going, going, whatever, YouTube,
[01:11:22] I don't know, does YouTube feel throughout like heinous shootings and stuff like that?
[01:11:26] Yeah. So where do you see stuff like that now? Oddly end, I don't know, go to deep into it,
[01:11:31] but oddly, they had a few websites out there that you could just go. Yeah. They say click here,
[01:11:35] make sure you're 18, whatever. Yeah. And then you can watch what ever sick video you want, but
[01:11:39] as I've noticed, not that I frequent these things, but as I've noticed, they've been kind of disappearing.
[01:11:45] Yeah, that's interesting. Like I remember there was a video of a Russian soldier
[01:11:53] being killed by a by a cheshishan, and it's brutal. They're putting his boot on his head, and they're
[01:11:59] just, he's screaming and their cuteness throughout, and he's sort of like slowly, the impact of the
[01:12:04] knife blade. Yeah, that's old school. There's way worse stuff. I'm saying that's old school, but I haven't
[01:12:09] seen that in a long time. And but I'm sure there's like some websites where you can see all that stuff.
[01:12:14] Yeah. And I like I said, I think they're kind of quietly doing away with them.
[01:12:22] Maybe because they encourage certain groups to be like, oh, let's see if we can put ours up,
[01:12:28] you know, because in that dark area of the internet, it's like the people who are responsible for
[01:12:33] making those videos. Sometimes they get into these little competitions to see who can make
[01:12:39] the sickest video. Well, and they go hard for sure. Even if you just saw rated our movies,
[01:12:49] you would be more accustomed to this kind of scenery. Oh, yeah. And you have like, like, yeah,
[01:12:56] the exposure of what war actually is is way more now compared to that time like that. Yeah, if you
[01:13:02] watched saving private Ryan, yeah, you're like, okay, man. I mean, this is, oh, yeah, and there's
[01:13:07] reports, plenty of reports like World War II veterans that we're at D Day. We're totally, you know,
[01:13:13] thought that nailed it and they were very disturbed in watching it. And had to take a break,
[01:13:18] had to walk out whatever because it was so realistic. So that's going to condition you. But if you
[01:13:23] leave freaking Maryland where you live in a small neighborhood and your dad works at the factory
[01:13:32] and next thing, you know, you're in World War I. And then, and then all of a sudden, three weeks
[01:13:39] later, you're back back in Maryland. You're in your neighborhood. Yeah, it's going to be a rough one.
[01:13:43] That's a good way to put it. Well, I was like, hey, they take you out of your normal world and make
[01:13:48] you do it about face with all this essential training and like all this, you know, this influence
[01:13:53] and stuff. And then when that's done, just all of a sudden, a do another about face, but hey,
[01:13:58] do it on your own kind of a thing. Same thing. That's exactly what happened to you know, that song
[01:14:02] by the White Buffaloly played on here. It's called Wish It Was True. Well, when he was on here,
[01:14:08] he played that song and I actually had like asked him to play that song. Yeah. And, um, but the song,
[01:14:15] you know, it's got a line in there that basically says, hey, you're just a number and we used you
[01:14:19] in your through and there's a couple of people that you know, left some comments or hit me up like,
[01:14:23] this is an anti-war song. What are you talking about? And I was like, hey, bro, this is what happens.
[01:14:29] Yeah. It doesn't happen all the time, but this is a, this is a song written from someone's individual
[01:14:33] viewpoint of, hey, went to war, whatever war it was, maybe it was World War One World War Two,
[01:14:38] World War, uh, Korea Vietnam. There's plenty of people that went to those wars,
[01:14:43] came home and this is exactly what happened. That's what that song is about. It's not saying,
[01:14:48] oh, you, you just got used by the every single soldiers, not saying that. But there, this happens.
[01:14:54] This does happen. And that's why it's such powerful song. This might sound a little bit insensitive,
[01:14:59] but you know, you don't, you don't ramble. That's what that story was essentially about.
[01:15:03] When you watch First Blood, you know, right? Like, that's essentially what it was about.
[01:15:07] And then they, then they, of course, they do them dirty again, send them to jail and then
[01:15:11] ramble too. They're like, oh, wait, we need that guy again. You know, let's go get that guy. And then they
[01:15:15] do them try to do them dirty again. Same same thing. That is essentially the story. You know,
[01:15:19] and it's not, and, and look, there's plenty of people that come home from war and they get,
[01:15:24] they're able to deal with it. And they go cool, you know what, I did what I had to do. And now I'm
[01:15:28] going back to the work, you know, go back to the factory, I'm going back to the construction site,
[01:15:32] going back to the, to the insurance business that I'm running or that I work at. Like,
[01:15:36] people, people do, and they also saw different things. Or did this person see? They'll do different
[01:15:40] things. What did this person do? So we got to take all these things into account. But no,
[01:15:45] like you just pointed out, echo, the fact that you're going to take hundreds of thousands of people
[01:15:50] in World War I and World War II, you're going to take hundreds of thousands of people
[01:15:55] and train them to kill. And then when it's over, you let cool, we're good. I appreciate it, see you later.
[01:16:01] And I mean, I don't, uh, Eugene Sledge. I mean, he had a really hard time when he came home from war.
[01:16:10] A really hard time when he came home from war. And he still carried on with his normal life. I mean,
[01:16:14] actually all those guys did, um, all those guys that were over there had a real hard time. But
[01:16:20] there's also millions of veterans that came home and like, they carried on with their life.
[01:16:26] You know, I mean, um, I mean, if had had him on this podcast, I mean, Charlie Plum, how does he come
[01:16:33] home from six years of captivity and just like, okay, well, you know, do you know, we're going to move on?
[01:16:39] William Reader. By the way, William Reader 40 years, like stayed in the army for another,
[01:16:44] whatever 38 years, huh? Doing his job, getting a fit rep. How do you write a fit rep for
[01:16:49] for William Reader? How do you not just say, hey, sir, what look, I'm supposed to be a charge of you.
[01:16:53] You just sound like what you want to do because you have done more than for the military than I could
[01:16:58] have ever hoped to have done. And I appreciate you sitting here and not like, not like beating me up,
[01:17:04] or whatever, not not counseling me on what an idiot I am. So there's plenty of people that
[01:17:09] come home and they, they, all right, now I will say this and Charlie Plum pointed this out to me,
[01:17:15] they're the amount of like, post-traumatic stress that the guys that were in the Hanoi
[01:17:21] Hilton had was less on average than normal, infantrymen. And it's because they had this camaraderie.
[01:17:29] At least that's what he said. At least I think I remember what he said. But what they had this camaraderie
[01:17:33] said was like, hey, you know, we were all, and they had time to process it and, and then they got this
[01:17:40] huge beautiful welcome home. And I mean, when I, it was Jim Serlesley, I think it was Jim Serlesley,
[01:17:47] when he, you know, he's lost both legs and his arm and the guys came home from being POWs
[01:17:53] with the white, you know, with the big reception. He was like, hey, bro. I understand you guys
[01:18:02] were held captive. I'm sorry, you know, I, I got back and just went to a freaking rehab for nine
[01:18:08] months and then I'm out here with one arm. So that probably helped the guys that were cap captives
[01:18:16] in Vietnam as well as that they got a very warm welcome home. And as we know, a lot of
[01:18:22] Vietnam veterans did not get a warm welcome home. And from what it sounds like here, same thing,
[01:18:30] World War I, oh, the look on their faces physically, they're in good shape mentally, they are gone.
[01:18:39] I wrote that down to that, that the metaphor that he describes about, we take them, we have them
[01:18:44] doing about face and then we have them doing another about face and it's they can't do that second one.
[01:18:49] We have them do the second one on their own on their own and they can't do it.
[01:18:52] It's not unreasonable to think and just I was literally just thinking about what, who are you?
[01:19:02] If you're a 21, 22 year old male in 1914, go to World War I, who are you? And it's, it's not
[01:19:11] unreasonable to think that they had no idea what war was period, what war was. And if you think about
[01:19:18] today like joining the military to your point, at least some exposures, successful anybody,
[01:19:26] you have some idea what war is. You've seen Pultoon, you've seen Cole Metal jacket, you've seen
[01:19:31] Save in Private Ryan, you've seen Apocalypse Now, you've seen all these movies. Yes. And it's in the
[01:19:36] National Psychic, you people are talking about it, people have been talking about it, if you were in
[01:19:40] World War I and you're 20, I mean the last, there's a story that's probably due to math, but like
[01:19:46] this, unless you have some connection to the Civil War which ended 50 years ago and you're
[01:19:51] getting stories from your grandpa, you have no idea what war is and then you're going to World War I.
[01:19:59] Where the use of human capital, the use of human being was less significant than
[01:20:08] than any other piece of material that was out there. And today like I did 23 years in the
[01:20:16] Marine Corps, I retired like five years, it's like 30 years coming up on my military experience.
[01:20:20] We take excessive, sometimes tactically unsound lengths to preserve American lives.
[01:20:27] Now obviously we know that doesn't always work out, but we don't buy design waste lives.
[01:20:35] And you can kind of almost count on that like, hey, there, there are no more human waves.
[01:20:39] There's no way, hey listen, Jens, have a seat, let's talk about this plan.
[01:20:43] We know we're all going to get wiped out, but we have to go do this.
[01:20:46] Those conversations aren't really happening. And so you kind of know what you're getting into
[01:20:52] a little bit, at least softens out a little bit, you know what war is, some idea what to
[01:20:56] words going to be like, I can't imagine a bigger contrast at being 19 years old age are going
[01:21:00] to Europe and like, hey, where is that? Okay cool, it's here. Hey, what country is that?
[01:21:06] That's this country here. Okay, who are we fighting? These people over here, how does this
[01:21:10] gonna work? Well, when you get there, we'll show you. Okay cool. And then you see World War
[01:21:17] 1. Yeah. The second about face to do on your own. Yeah, it's going to be rough. It's not going
[01:21:24] to work out, right? And he's not touring the country going. Yeah. And yeah, the frustration is,
[01:21:30] should we probably take a couple of those dollars? I mean the sarcasm with with just the
[01:21:35] sea so should we take a couple of those dollars? It may be help these folks with that about face
[01:21:39] these patriots over here making money. Again, and this is just me saying, I can appreciate
[01:21:45] this point of view, get where he's coming from. And this is, this is not some coward. This is not
[01:21:54] some, this is not a dude who's sitting on the sidelines casting judgment. This is a guy who,
[01:21:59] who, for whatever got back in the, this is a guy who can speak, you know, of a first person
[01:22:04] point of view certainly again. So he gets done talking about that part of the bill and he says,
[01:22:11] that's a part of the bill. So much for the dead, they have paid their part of the war profits.
[01:22:17] So much for the mentally and physically wounded. They are paying now for their share of the war
[01:22:23] profits. But others paid too. They paid with heartbreaks when they tore themselves away from their
[01:22:29] fire sides and their families to down the uniform of Uncle Sam on which a profit had been made.
[01:22:36] They paid another part in the training camps where they were regimented and drilled while others took
[01:22:41] their jobs and their places in their lives and in their communities. They paid for it in the
[01:22:46] trenches when they were shot at and they were shot, where they were hungry for days at a time,
[01:22:51] where they slept in mud and cold and rain with the moans and shrieks of the dying for a horrible
[01:22:58] lullaby. But don't forget the soldier paid part of the dollars and cents bill too.
[01:23:07] Up to an including the Spanish-American War, we had a prize system and soldiers and sailors fought
[01:23:12] for money during the Civil War they were paid bonuses and many instances before they went into
[01:23:17] service. The government or the states paid as high as $1,200 for an enlistment.
[01:23:22] In the Spanish-American War they gave prize money when we captured any vessel vessels,
[01:23:29] the soldiers all got their share. At least they were supposed to.
[01:23:33] Then it was found we could reduce the cost of wars by taking all the prize money and keeping it.
[01:23:39] But constricted, conscripting, the soldiers anyway. So it's going to the draft. Then soldiers
[01:23:45] couldn't bargain for their labor and either. Everyone else could bargain. But the soldier couldn't.
[01:23:52] Napoleon once said, all men are enamored of decorations. They positively hunger for them.
[01:23:58] So by developing an Napoleonic system, the metal business, the government learned to
[01:24:03] get soldiers for less money because the boys like to be decorated. Until the Civil War there
[01:24:08] were no metals. Then the congressional metal of honor was handed out. It made enlistments easier.
[01:24:14] After the Civil War no new metals were issued until the Spanish-American War. In the World War
[01:24:19] we used propaganda to make the boys accept conscription. They were made to feel ashamed if they
[01:24:26] didn't join the army. So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it.
[01:24:32] With a few exceptions our clergymen joined then in the clamor to kill, kill, kill, to kill the
[01:24:38] Germans. God is on our side. It is his will that the German should be killed. And in Germany the
[01:24:45] good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the Allies to please the same God. That was part of
[01:24:52] the general propaganda built up to make people war, conscious and murder, conscious.
[01:25:02] Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. This was the war to end
[01:25:06] all wars. This was the war to make the world safe for democracy. No one mentioned to them as they
[01:25:12] marched away that they're going and dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these
[01:25:17] American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.
[01:25:22] No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by submarines
[01:25:26] built with United States patents. They were just told it was going to be a glorious adventure.
[01:25:32] Thus having stuffed patriotism down their throats it was decided to make them help pay for the
[01:25:40] war too. So we gave them a large salary of $30 a month. All they had to do for this magnificent
[01:25:46] sum was to leave their dear ones behind, give up their jobs, lion swampy trenches, eat canned
[01:25:52] willy when they could get it and kill and kill and kill and be killed. But wait, half that wage
[01:25:58] just a little more than a riveter and a shipyard or a laborer in a munitions factory safe at home
[01:26:03] made in a day. Half that wage was promptly taken from him to support his dependence so that he would
[01:26:07] not become a charge upon his community. Then we made him pay what amount to to accident insurance,
[01:26:13] something the employer pays for in an enlightened state. And that cost him about $6 a month.
[01:26:19] Yet less than $9 a month left. Then the most crowning influence of all he was virtually
[01:26:25] blackjacked into paying for his own ammunition clothing and food by being made to buy Liberty
[01:26:31] bonds. Most soldiers got no money at all on paydays. We made them buy back, we made them buy Liberty
[01:26:40] bonds for $100 and then we bought them back when they came back from the war and couldn't find
[01:26:44] work at $84 and $86 and the soldiers brought a bought about $2 billion worth of these bonds.
[01:26:52] Yes, the soldier pays the greater part of the bill. His family pays to
[01:26:58] they pay it in the same heartbreak that he does as he suffers day suffer. At nights as he lay in
[01:27:03] the trenches and watch Shrapnel burst about him, they lay home in their beds and tossly
[01:27:08] plously. His father, his mother, his wife, his sisters, his brothers, his sons and his daughters.
[01:27:14] When he returned home minus an eye or minus a leg or with his mind broken, they suffered too.
[01:27:20] As much and sometimes even more than he, yes, and they too contributed their dollars to the
[01:27:28] profits of the munition makers and bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the
[01:27:32] speculators made, they too bought Liberty bonds and contributed to the profit of the bankers
[01:27:37] after the armistice in the hoax post-pocus of manipulated Liberty bond prices.
[01:27:42] And even now the families of the wounded men and of the mentally broken and those who
[01:27:50] were never able to readjust themselves are still suffering and pain.
[01:27:54] Fact check. I'm going to go ahead and say truth.
[01:28:10] So it's going on.
[01:28:21] Chapter 4.
[01:28:21] How to smash this racket?
[01:28:26] Well, it's a racket all right. A few profit and the many pay.
[01:28:31] But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by a disarmament conference. You can't eliminate it
[01:28:36] by peace, parlaise, Geneva, well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions.
[01:28:42] It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.
[01:28:46] The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before nations
[01:28:53] manhood can be conscripted. And there's this interesting thing I got to point out when he talks
[01:28:58] about capital, industry and labor. He's talking about those groups of people.
[01:29:03] And I'm not going to check. It would be saying like the capitalists and the industrialists
[01:29:08] and the labor force. You could say that but that's what he, there's the words he uses
[01:29:14] this capital industry, talking about those people.
[01:29:17] One month before the government can constripped the young man of the nation,
[01:29:21] it must constripped capital and industry and labor. Let the officers and the directors and the
[01:29:27] high-powered executives of our armament factories and munition makers and our shipbuilders and
[01:29:32] airplane builders and the manufacturers of all other things that provide profit and wartime
[01:29:36] as well as the bankers and the speculators be conscripted to get $30 a month the same
[01:29:41] wage is the lads and the trenches get. But the workers and these plants get the same wages.
[01:29:47] All the workers, all presidents, all executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers,
[01:29:51] yes and all generals and admirals and officers and all politicians and all government officer
[01:29:56] office holders, everyone in the nation can be restricted to a total monthly income not to be
[01:30:01] not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches.
[01:30:06] Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers
[01:30:11] in industry and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage
[01:30:17] to their families and pay war risk insurance and by liberty bonds. Why shouldn't they?
[01:30:24] They aren't running the risk of being killed or having their bodies mangled or their minds shattered.
[01:30:28] They aren't sleeping in muddy trenches. They aren't hungry. The soldiers are.
[01:30:34] Give capital and industry and labor 30 days to think it over and you will find by that time
[01:30:39] there will be no war that will smash the racket that and nothing else.
[01:30:45] Maybe I'm a little too optimistic. Capital still has some say so capital won't
[01:30:49] permit the taking of profit out of war until the people those who do the suffering and still
[01:30:53] pay the price make up their minds that those they elect to office shall do their bidding
[01:30:59] and not that of the profit yours.
[01:31:00] You know so here you get to like a kind of an argument that's hyperbole right?
[01:31:15] Hey what you need to do is first just if you're going to go and you don't know what to
[01:31:19] argue with it because it makes sense but it's just a unrealistic thing to think about.
[01:31:24] Unfortunately, guys we all get the idea. You want to go you want to go to war?
[01:31:31] Cool and he's the interesting he's not going to talk about them going to war. He's just talking
[01:31:34] about you just get the pay and he's only talking about for 30 days. He's only talking about for 30
[01:31:40] days. 30 days you know you're the CEO of a defense company for 30 days you're going to get this pay.
[01:31:48] I actually don't think that's enough right now and they get to have to be all a lot more.
[01:31:52] You always hear that and actually when you when you read about the Vietnam War,
[01:32:01] one of the things that really started to turn the tide of the American public against the Vietnam
[01:32:07] War was the draft because all of a sudden it wasn't just the freaking poor redneck from West
[01:32:17] Virginia or the inner city black kid from Harlem that was getting shipped off the war.
[01:32:22] All of a sudden it was like oh you're from wherever and your dad is a lawyer. Your dad is a judge.
[01:32:30] Your dad is a business owner and you got a bunch of money and guess what? Yeah, load up,
[01:32:37] load up on the bus because it's time to go get some and that's as that expanded and normal
[01:32:44] richer people started going to war. It was like rich kids the rich parents started sending their
[01:32:51] kids off to war. That's a problem and that's one of the things that started to push the
[01:32:55] the resistance against the Vietnam War because when it was just hey we're sending a bunch of
[01:33:03] damn poor people. Hey cool whatever that's not my kid my kid's not my kid's going to freaking
[01:33:08] a college next year. He's not going to boot camp. He's not going to nom. So I don't care. Yeah,
[01:33:14] it seems like a great idea. Let's stop calming us over there until little Johnny gets freaking
[01:33:19] called up and then they're like oh maybe not. So I would say from that perspective that's
[01:33:25] that's a good assessment realistic assessment that if you start saying oh yeah you want to
[01:33:31] say you want to send America to war cool your kid goes people start changing their freaking minds real quick.
[01:33:39] Factually. He doesn't stop there he's got another step another step which is funny because he
[01:33:48] he starts off by saying this the only thing you need to do but he does have another step.
[01:33:52] Another step necessary in this fight to smash the war racket is limited a limited
[01:33:56] plebiscite sorry plebiscite which is a plebiscite is a direct vote like I just a vote plebiscite.
[01:34:06] Another step necessary in this war in this fight to smash the war racket is the limited plebiscite
[01:34:12] to determine whether a war should be declared a plebiscite not of all the voters but merely of
[01:34:19] those who would be called upon to do the fighting and dying. There wouldn't be very much sense
[01:34:24] in having a 76 year old president of a munitions factory or the flat-footed head of an international
[01:34:30] baking firm or the cross-eyed manager of a uniform man your manufacturing plant all of whom
[01:34:37] see see visions of tremendous profits in the event of war voting on whether the nation could
[01:34:42] should go to war not. They never would be called upon to shoulder arms to sleep in the trench
[01:34:48] and to be shot. Only those who would be called upon to risk their lives for country should have
[01:34:54] the privilege of voting to determine whether the nation should go to war.
[01:35:01] There is ample precedent for restricting the voting to those affected many of our states have
[01:35:05] restrictions on those permitted to vote in most it is necessary to be able to read and write before you
[01:35:10] may vote in some you must own property it would be a simple matter each year for the men coming
[01:35:15] of military age to register in their communities as they did in the draft during the World War
[01:35:21] and be physically examined those who could pass and who were therefore to be who were therefore
[01:35:26] be called upon to bear arms in the event of a war would be eligible to vote in a limited
[01:35:31] plebiscite. They should be the ones to have the power to decide and not a Congress.
[01:35:38] Few of those few of whose members are within the age limit and fewer still of whom are in the
[01:35:44] physical condition to bear arms only those who must suffer should have the right to vote.
[01:35:53] As I said in a non that kind of work people said not Johnny. He said there was one step
[01:36:04] and he introduced to here's the third one. A third step in this business of smashing war
[01:36:09] rackets to make certain that our military forces are truly forces for defense only at each
[01:36:14] session of Congress the question whether a further naval appropriations comes up.
[01:36:21] The swivel chair addables of Washington and there are always a lot of them are very
[01:36:25] a droid lobbyist and they are smart. They don't shout that we need a lot of battleships
[01:36:31] we need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation. Oh no first of all they let
[01:36:36] it be known that America is metast by a great naval power. Almost any day these admirals will tell
[01:36:40] you the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly in an eyelet 125 million people
[01:36:45] just like that. Then they begin to cry for a larger navy for what to fight the enemy.
[01:36:50] Oh my no oh no for defense purposes only. Then incidentally they announce maneuvers in the
[01:36:55] Pacific for defense. Uh-huh the Pacific is a great big ocean. We have tremendous coastline on a
[01:37:01] Pacific. Will the maneuvers be off the coast two or 300 miles? Oh no the maneuvers will be 2000. Yes
[01:37:06] perhaps even 3500 miles off the coast. The Japanese are proud people. Of course we'll be pleased
[01:37:12] beyond expression to see the United States fleet so close to nippons shores. Even as pleased as
[01:37:17] would be the residents of California where they did dimly discern through the morning mist
[01:37:22] the Japanese fleet playing at war games off Los Angeles. The ships of our navy it can be seen
[01:37:29] should specifically limited by law should be specifically limited by law to within 200 miles of
[01:37:34] our coastline. Had that been the law of 1898 the main never would have gone to Havana Harbor.
[01:37:39] She never would have been blown up. There never would have been no war with Spain with the
[01:37:43] attendant loss of life 200 miles is ample in the opinion of experts for defense purposes.
[01:37:48] Our nation cannot start off an offensive war if it is ships can't go further than 200 miles off the
[01:37:52] coastline. Plans might be ready to go 500 miles from the coast for the purpose of reconnaissance
[01:37:58] and the army should never leave the territorial limits of our nation.
[01:38:02] Summarize three steps must be taken to smash the war racket. One we must take the profit out of war.
[01:38:08] Two we must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war
[01:38:14] and three we must limit our military forces to home defense purposes.
[01:38:19] Again not great strategic plan does sit back and like to stay in your own
[01:38:25] AO you want to project power a little bit you have to piss people off but you definitely want to
[01:38:31] project some power out there. Where are you right now Dave? I'm just summarizing what he said.
[01:38:37] I'm just trying to I'm spending this all this time just trying to appreciate what he's saying.
[01:38:44] Because obviously and I'm going to wait you know I know there's a couple more things to read here.
[01:38:47] I'm going to I'm going to wait to the conclusion but I spent a lot of time in my own
[01:38:53] brand saying I hear what you're saying. I hear what you're saying. Well this is a but there's a yeah
[01:38:59] well this is the thing that we have to do and that's like what the whole start of this thing.
[01:39:03] Hey listen man we just spent a trillion dollars totally now in a 20 year war
[01:39:09] and when we got there the Taliban was in control of whatever percentage of the of the country
[01:39:16] and now we left and they're now going to control 100% is the of the country told we spent a trillion
[01:39:20] dollars we have thousands of lost lives we have thousands more wounded named for life.
[01:39:31] Yeah and and and you have to at least open your mind and say okay what was this guy talking about?
[01:39:37] Yeah well was he talking about because like you said this isn't some on chair quarterback
[01:39:41] this is a guy that fought.
[01:39:42] What chapter five to hell with war? I am not as fool to believe that war is a thing of the
[01:39:55] past. I know the people do not want war but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another
[01:40:00] war. Looking back Woodrow Wilson was real is reelected president in 1916 on a platform that he
[01:40:08] had quote kept us out of war and quote and on the implied promise that he would quote keep us out of war.
[01:40:17] Yeah five months later he asked Congress to declare war in Germany and that five month interval
[01:40:21] that people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. The four million young men who
[01:40:25] put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked whether they wanted to go for
[01:40:30] if it's to suffer and die. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly?
[01:40:36] Money. Money. An Allied commission it may be recalled came over shortly before the war declaration
[01:40:45] and called on the president. The president summoned a group of advisors. The head of the commission
[01:40:49] spoke stripped of its bipelomatic language. This is what he told the president and his group.
[01:40:56] There's no use in kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the Allies has lost. We now owe you
[01:41:02] American bankers, American, American, American makers, American manufacturers, American speculators,
[01:41:07] American exporters, five or six billion dollars. If we lose and without the help of the United
[01:41:14] States we will use we England, France, Italy cannot pay back this money and Germany won't. So
[01:41:24] end quote had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations were concerned and had the press
[01:41:32] been invited to be present at that conference or had the radio been available to broadcast the
[01:41:36] pre-seedings. America never would have entered the world of war. But this conference like all
[01:41:42] war discussions were shrouded in not most secrecy. When our boys were sent off to war they were told
[01:41:49] it was a quote war to make the world safe for democracy and a quote war to end all wars.
[01:41:54] Well 18 years after the world has less of the democracy than it had. Besides what business
[01:42:03] is it of ours whether Russia or Germany or England or France or Italy or Austria live under
[01:42:09] democracies or monarchies whether they are fascist or communist are promised to preserve our own
[01:42:16] democracy and very little if anything has been accomplished to assure us that the world war was
[01:42:23] really the war to end all wars. Yes we have disarmament conferences and limitations of
[01:42:30] arms conferences they don't mean a thing. One has just failed the results of another had been
[01:42:37] nullified. We send our professional soldiers and sailors and our politicians and our diplomats
[01:42:43] to these conferences and what happens? The professional soldiers and sailors don't want to disarm
[01:42:49] no admiral wants to be without a ship no general wants to be without a command. Both mean men
[01:42:58] both mean men without jobs they are not for disarmament. They cannot be for limitations of arms
[01:43:06] and in all these conferences lurking in the background but all powerful just the same are the
[01:43:10] sinister agents who profit by war. They see two at that these conferences do not disarm or
[01:43:18] seriously limit armaments. The chief aim of any power and any of these conferences has not been
[01:43:26] to achieve disarmament to prevent war but rather to get more armament for itself
[01:43:35] and less for any potential flow. I remember having this thought when Ewen I were in the
[01:43:44] Battle of Romani and that thought was how freaking awesome the US military was and how much
[01:43:55] of that awesomeness relied on these individual human beings that were making things happen.
[01:44:03] Because when you look at the operations that were taking place when you look at the effort that was
[01:44:09] put forth it was literally platoon commanders company commanders battalion commanders brigade commander
[01:44:18] that was that was through force of will making things happen. Making things happen you could if if
[01:44:27] if the brigade commander didn't really care and just wanted to kind of do a deployment getting
[01:44:32] under his belt and just like yep I did my deployment. If he didn't care if you didn't want to do good
[01:44:40] we wouldn't have done anything. Yeah right. Oh the battalion commander that's going to push into
[01:44:44] an area of operations that hasn't been pushed into there is individual effort.
[01:44:52] And here's what scary is looking the battle of Romani we were trying to we're trying to
[01:44:59] stabilize and secure the city of Romani. If there is no goal like that, a clearly defined goal
[01:45:06] and you have people that are trying to do make their best individual effort to make their mark
[01:45:12] to leave their mark to do something to get a good fit rep. What are you going to do? You're going to say
[01:45:19] why I'm going to do this we're going to do that we're going to expand we're going to grow more I need
[01:45:23] more people. This idea that there's no real competing, competing asset or competing
[01:45:33] competing perspective of someone that's saying hey wait a second what are you actually doing
[01:45:38] over there? I mean if let's say you and you are in the Marine Corps and you are supposed to train
[01:45:44] Iraqi soldiers and I do turn over with you and you say hey Jaka we train 100 Iraqi soldiers and
[01:45:54] I go that's great how many Iraqi soldiers do you think I'm going to train? How many think?
[01:46:00] At least the 101 at least the 101. Yeah I'm going to do more than you totally.
[01:46:05] I'm going to do more new I remember this is back in the day I remember going out on a
[01:46:09] workups with the with the fleet and you could see I did a workup with the fleet that was I
[01:46:19] wasn't I wasn't embarked but we did some work with Marines then my next deployment I did
[01:46:26] a full workup with the Marines then the next one I did another full workup with the Marines so I
[01:46:29] did basically saw three workups in a row with the Marines and each one of them was a little bit more
[01:46:36] each workup was a little bit more sure to hey oh yeah you guys did you guys did four amphibious
[01:46:41] landings I'm gonna do five we did five oh what about the next one the next I do in six
[01:46:47] this is real yeah I had similar experience and even in training you know classic
[01:46:53] question was the the outgoing squadron versus the incoming squadron how many pounds of
[01:46:56] orders did you drop you know 74,000 cool hey right on the board we're dropping 75 okay
[01:47:01] and that's why I said 101 yeah yeah yeah whatever that is yeah 100% 100% so when you get so
[01:47:11] that that just reminds me what we're talking about here which is no admiral goes you know what I
[01:47:15] think we need less ships the amount of admels that say that is zero the amount of generals that say
[01:47:21] I need less divisions I need less brigades I need less battalion the number of generals that say
[01:47:26] that is zero or you know sure are there some I'm sure there are but the vast majority and those
[01:47:33] those few that say well I think we need less ships he's not gonna he's definitely not getting promoted
[01:47:38] I'm gonna see you know yeah you definitely not gonna be to see you know hey I'm the guy that
[01:47:42] downsize the Navy promote me it's not happening right it's not happening hey I got us less brigades
[01:47:47] less combat brigades good job yeah let's promote you no one says that so you have this self-fulfilling
[01:47:53] prophecy and the self-licking ice cream cone which is a term I understand what it means but I'm not exactly
[01:47:58] sure you know where it came for right but that's what you have right is we want to have more and
[01:48:04] that's exactly what he's talking about here there was no one there was very few people
[01:48:10] that would come back and say hey yeah the Iraqi soldiers we had to do it in a body we had to say
[01:48:16] these guys are not ready yet because it was it was so obvious what would happen if we just sent
[01:48:22] them out on their own and they tried I mean remember they turned over like some of the checkpoints
[01:48:27] like two nine or five and they turned it over and and two days later the insurgents hit it and
[01:48:33] overrun it yeah ECP three down there by on the bridge same thing turned it over to the Iraqi
[01:48:39] is hey these guys are ready you know it's like actually know they weren't ready and they got annihilated
[01:48:45] so there wasn't really the the opportunity for us to be like well yeah the Iraqi troops that we
[01:48:51] are trained are now 100% what they call it what they call it they're ready for unilateral operations
[01:48:56] right I didn't send up a message and yep our Iraqis that we've been training for six months
[01:49:00] are now ready for unilateral operations even though that was what everybody wanted us to say but
[01:49:04] we couldn't say it there because you would find out on their first operation that there is no possible
[01:49:09] way they were ready but if we would have been a more permissive environment the pressure to say
[01:49:14] yeah hey they can connect unilateral in the unilateral operations the pressure would have been so
[01:49:18] great because otherwise me like hey jacco the last the last task in a commander that was out here has
[01:49:24] you know he trained up four platoon special mission unit elements that are now that were now
[01:49:30] ready to perform unilateral operations what did you do I'd be like well actually I don't think
[01:49:35] those four are even capable and we should downgrade them what's wrong with you jacco the last task
[01:49:41] in a commander was able to is why couldn't you do that so you we could have felt that pressure
[01:49:45] and a lot of times people break to that pressure I mean obviously I think that happened a lot
[01:49:50] in Afghanistan yeah we trained these guys for six months and who says yeah we trained somebody for
[01:49:56] six months they're not capable we trained them for a year they're not capable it's difficult it's a
[01:50:02] difficult thing to do it's also difficult to assess so I think you get this that's what he's talking
[01:50:10] about here there's no no animal wants to be without a ship no general wants to be a lot of command so what
[01:50:15] do they do they want more there's only one way back to the book there's only one way to disarm
[01:50:23] any semblance of practicality that is for all nations to get together and scrap every ship every
[01:50:30] gun every rifle every tank every warplane even this if it were possible would not be enough the
[01:50:36] next war according to experts will not be fought with battleships not by artillery not with rifles and
[01:50:41] not with machine guns but it will be fought with deadly chemicals and gases secretly each nation
[01:50:48] is studying and perfecting newer and ghastly remains of annihilating its foes wholesale yes ships
[01:50:56] will continue to be built for the ship builders must make their profits and guns will still be
[01:51:00] manufactured manufactured and powder and rifles will be made for the munitions makers must
[01:51:06] make their huge profits and the soldiers of course must wear uniforms for the manufacturer must make
[01:51:14] their war profits too but victory or defeat will be determined by the skill and ingenuity of our
[01:51:20] scientists if we put them to work making poison gas and more and more finished mechanical and
[01:51:28] explosive instruments of destruction they will have no time for the constructive job of building
[01:51:34] greater prosperity for all peoples by putting them to this useful job we can all make more money
[01:51:42] out of peace then we can out of war even the munitions bakers so I say to hell with war
[01:51:51] and that's the end of it again you know he's in the end you know kind of got the fantasy
[01:52:04] got the fantasy argument of hey can't we just have people working on good the have the
[01:52:10] scientists working on good stuff instead of evil stuff and like yeah cool like so it's such an
[01:52:15] extreme argument that people go oh he's he's crazy right and let's throw this whole book out but
[01:52:24] if we're to actually listen to what he's saying and maybe put some of it in the crazy pot
[01:52:30] and put some out in the just factual pot and then some of it is debatable like okay what does that
[01:52:36] actually mean how does that apply today I think it's I think it's very important for us to do that
[01:52:41] I was recently on Russell Brands podcast and the thing is it's behind a paywall is that right
[01:52:50] yes pay a firewall paywall it's behind a paywall and so Russell Brand if you don't know who he is he's a guy
[01:52:58] from England super nice guy very funny guy he's he's originally a comedian kind of a movie comedian
[01:53:04] yeah kind of and a performer as well so yes aka all this snow what's his now all this snow that's his
[01:53:13] other alias oh really yeah that's like his character you know and what's that guys supposed to be like
[01:53:19] singer really yeah get him to the Greek uh forgetting ceremonial look into it that's who Russell Brand is okay
[01:53:28] he's a man so it was an actor too yes super nice guy and he asked me to be on his podcast and it was
[01:53:36] pretty it's pretty cool because he started off the podcast he was saying like he's been real
[01:53:42] complimentary of me and like and and just being nice you know this guy you know he thanked me for my
[01:53:48] service and and you know he he said I did great bunch of great stuff and and real complimentary
[01:53:54] little nice and and I kind of said hey man I appreciate it I said bro I'm not like this I'm not a rare
[01:54:03] hero from the military I said I had a kind of average career and then he goes well you know I just
[01:54:09] wanted to say that because I want you to know that I respect the military but because I want to set
[01:54:15] that up properly because I also have like some issues and I'm gonna probably go he didn't use the
[01:54:21] term hard in the paint because he's from England but he basically meant I'm gonna go hard in the paint
[01:54:26] on some topics and then I said well hey you should then know that even though I spent my
[01:54:33] don't life in the military I was also like a hardcore kid growing up listening to heavy metal
[01:54:39] plane and bands I'm a rebellious kid I listened to punk rock and heavy metal and so you should just
[01:54:45] know that too that even though I because he he also mentioned the music as I look like a hippie and
[01:54:49] I was like because I know I look like a the most military human that you could imagine that's true
[01:54:55] yeah that I also know that you know you should know that I'm kind of a rebel and that's well and so
[01:54:59] then we had a little laugh and so so eventually you know we get to we start having the conversation and then
[01:55:07] he posed this kind of two questions and they were somehow paired up or they were somehow there was
[01:55:16] like a semi colon between them meaning they were attached they weren't quite separate but they were still
[01:55:21] attached but they were they were a little bit separate so the one of them was like isn't war driven
[01:55:27] by the profitability of the military industrial complex that was kind of question to one of them
[01:55:31] one and then similar question isn't capitalism and and businesses and corporations aren't
[01:55:39] they simply driven by the profitability for the rich owners and shareholders so that was kind
[01:55:46] of the question aren't these two major forces in the world the military and the corporate world aren't
[01:55:51] they just driven by greed essentially and then I answered him and you know my answer was well
[01:56:02] Russell the answer is yes and I think I think he was a little bit taken aback by that
[01:56:13] answer but the fact that matter is it's true that profits certainly drive corporations
[01:56:21] to do things to to make products and defense companies certainly get rich during wars as we just
[01:56:30] heard from smedly balder those totally true totally true and just like smedly balder like
[01:56:41] you and I were saying that that's like one part of the argument that's not the only driver
[01:56:47] that's not the only driver and I mean for the corporate example I work with hundreds of companies
[01:56:55] and Dave you work with hundreds companies and the companies make money they make a lot of money
[01:57:06] and they are certainly driven by profits in some way but they're also making products that people want
[01:57:10] and they're making products that people need and they're employing people and they're making
[01:57:15] products that make people's lives better that's what's happening in the vast majority of cases
[01:57:22] no better example than medical device companies pharmaceutical companies and I've worked with
[01:57:29] scores of medical device companies I've worked with scores of pharmaceutical companies over the last
[01:57:34] decade and some of those companies that I've worked with that you've worked with Dave some of those
[01:57:39] companies make hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in profit billions of dollars in profit
[01:57:47] and so you could say here's a well that's what's driving them just to want to make money but
[01:57:54] I have also seen and met their patience along the way
[01:58:01] you go to event and they got a man or a woman or a child a little boy or a little girl and the
[01:58:08] only reason that that child is still alive is because of this device that that company makes
[01:58:16] or this drug that this company makes that's why they are on stage they will present
[01:58:24] and they'll get these people up there and say thank you and those patients who are only
[01:58:28] alive because of these companies are grateful to be alive and they are overjoyed that those
[01:58:37] capitalist doctors were greedy enough to take the risk and invest money and push hard
[01:58:43] and toil I do the work to create products that actually saved people's lives
[01:58:52] and the same thing the same thing can be said for war the same thing can be said for war
[01:59:00] and I have participated in wars that made some defense companies tons of money
[01:59:07] you know I said I said this Russell brand something along the lines of like listen
[01:59:15] I could be talking to my platoon and say all right guys here's what's going on tonight
[01:59:18] we're going to go out we're going to risk our lives and I just wanted to let you know that every
[01:59:22] round that you fire is going to put 12 cents into the pockets of the wartime profitiers
[01:59:28] right and that would actually be true because that is true those those rounds cost money
[01:59:33] and those defense companies make money from those things but I also know what happens on the ground
[01:59:41] Dave you know what happens on the ground I know I know that we help people the people on the ground
[01:59:50] I know that we killed evil terrorists and insurgents that systematically tortured and raped
[01:59:58] and murdered the innocent local populace I know that we did that I know that we were able to protect
[02:00:08] children from these insurgents from these tears I know we were able to protect families I know
[02:00:13] that those families wanted these insurgents out of their city and out of their country
[02:00:18] and so while there were defense companies certainly making money there was a simultaneous
[02:00:30] good that was taking place then we took lives but we also saved lives and that's the truth
[02:00:38] enriching global corporations and enriching the military industrial complex that enrichment
[02:00:49] certainly influences behaviors right it influences someone that's making a weapon system
[02:00:55] to try and make their weapon system better to try and make better body armor there's a
[02:01:01] there's someone right now as we speak that is trying to make better body armor and part of the
[02:01:06] reason that trying to make it is to protect the American soldier but guess what they got a mortgage
[02:01:11] to pay and they want to make better body armor because they want to make more money and if they
[02:01:15] can make better body armor then the US government goes wow that's lighter it's stronger it
[02:01:20] provides more protection we're going to buy it it's not that the person is just thinking about money
[02:01:26] but the money that the the two goals are aligned there's a simultaneous drive that is that is moving
[02:01:35] behavior in the right direction and oftentimes like I just use that example body armor they're aligned
[02:01:41] with this company out there
[02:01:43] acme body armor they want to make best body armor
[02:01:48] and they want to make it do they want to protect Americans yes they do do they want to make money yes they do
[02:01:53] so I have no problem with that if they're aligned it works out perfectly here's the problem
[02:01:59] the problem is if they're out of alignment that's where it can become awful and that's what we
[02:02:07] need to watch out for what is the driving force behind going to war are we going to work
[02:02:13] is the right thing to do are we going to war for benevolent reasons are we positive that it will
[02:02:19] have a positive impact that will offset the natural negative impacts of work because when you
[02:02:25] go on a war there's going to be negative impacts people are going to die people are going to
[02:02:28] get wounded and is the positive impact going to offset that negative impact is it going to help
[02:02:34] stability in the world is there a strategic benefit for us as America
[02:02:45] if we're going to war for those reasons because there's going to be a strategic advantage because
[02:02:49] it protects our national security because it's going to be truly good for the people on the ground
[02:02:54] that need protection that need help to get out from a tyrannical or evil regime and there are
[02:03:02] evil regimes and if you don't think there's evil regimes you're wrong because there's people in the
[02:03:12] world there's regimes in the world that will systematically rape little kids so if we're going to war
[02:03:23] for those reasons okay we can consider it if the primary driver of going to war is to make money
[02:03:35] if it's to profit if it's to sell more guns and bombs if it's not going to stabilize the
[02:03:42] world if it doesn't help us protect our national security if it's going to be a strategic defeat
[02:03:47] then we're wrong and can there be alignment by these two drivers yes there absolutely can
[02:03:57] I don't mind I don't mind someone making great body armor making money off I don't
[02:04:01] make I don't mind somebody making a great weapon system that makes a bunch of money and it
[02:04:05] helps us win a war I have no problem with that at all but if these things aren't aligned and
[02:04:11] we're fighting for money you're fighting for profit and we're not getting positive impact and
[02:04:14] we're not getting strategic benefit well then we need to listen to major general smedly
[02:04:22] butler and say to help with one that's what I'm thinking. Dave I'm with you I was thinking of a
[02:04:33] story as you as you said that I I don't even remember why I was in the Pentagon but I was in the
[02:04:38] Pentagon for something and it was maybe like I was just taking over this F-35 job and how
[02:04:46] to go meet somebody in the Pentagon whatever Dave came up to the Pentagon I talked to some
[02:04:50] general I'm literally walking the halls of the Pentagon and I run into who is an old
[02:04:55] battalion commander that I work with who is now I happen to be a one star just literally walked
[02:04:59] into him in a you know waiting room of some office somewhere waiting for some meeting and we
[02:05:04] bumped into each other and he was there with a couple people from a company in industry so
[02:05:08] civilians in the industry and he was there to show the technology of a helmet that they designed
[02:05:16] to stop a 762 caliber sniper rifle a helmet light enough what's strong enough to stop a sniper
[02:05:22] rifle and for those of you who are listening to don't know the story of and I've talked in general
[02:05:28] terms about my radio operator Chris Leon who was on my team the first Anglico Marine killed my
[02:05:34] radio operator was killed in the money the first Anglico Marine killed an Iraq was my radio operator
[02:05:38] was shot and killed by a sniper that pierced his helmet went right through the temple of his helmet
[02:05:42] and killed him was I onboard with this company making profit making money off the American
[02:05:51] taxpayer to design a helmet that would somehow have prevented what happened or at least can prevent
[02:05:58] what might happen in the future yes I'm on board of that plan I'm onboard with that plan and I
[02:06:02] support that plan and I want that plan to not only make them money but make enough money to
[02:06:08] continue to build even better technology grow their company and be a positive force for whatever
[02:06:12] may happen so I am I am totally on board with that idea and this idea of alignment
[02:06:19] and while where I struggled especially towards the end listening to him talk you reading
[02:06:25] his words was I think a trap that is so easy to fall into is that we describe it as the
[02:06:32] government or industry or the military one of the things that I've learned in our current
[02:06:40] jobs that these are actually people they're people the military is just people and generals
[02:06:46] and animals are regular people and you know what there are some really good ones and there are
[02:06:50] some not so good ones and people in the government I know classmates in mind that are that work
[02:06:57] in the government and you know what they try to do most of the time every day the right thing
[02:07:02] they try to do the right thing do they always do the right thing no are their forces it
[02:07:06] play that make a difficult of course but when you fall into this trap of like oh it's the government
[02:07:12] it's really is it created an error to buy which they're only goal is to somehow
[02:07:17] whether it's lying there pockets or whatever that might be is we lose side of the fact that most
[02:07:24] of the mechanics that are going on inside industry these companies we work with are regular people
[02:07:30] trying to do the right thing even for the most part of my experience at the highest levels we work
[02:07:35] with CEOs of multi billion dollar companies and what you get to know is that for the most part
[02:07:42] for the most part they're people trying to do the right thing they try to make money yes
[02:07:48] because for a whole host of good reasons they want to pay their bills they want to pay their
[02:07:52] people they want to grow they want to expand they want to build bright products and they're
[02:07:55] safe they can reach more but all these things and I'm not naive and I don't want people to think
[02:08:01] the exact opposite of like everybody's just altruistic and for the for the big no that that's not the
[02:08:06] case but there's a trap that we can fall into which was there's this this thing the industry
[02:08:15] well if it's just the industry then yeah it's easy to paint them as this this this
[02:08:19] thing that's not a real thing it's not a person it's not a human being and what this thing
[02:08:23] wants is to just soak up dollar bills or waste human life to get to their end state
[02:08:31] with no regard for that and and that is a that is a trap that I think it's easy to fall into
[02:08:38] and you can hear his words like hey hang on a second just hang on who is this company who are
[02:08:47] these industries or governments or whatever these things we're talking about most of the time
[02:08:53] most of the time that are people trying to do the right thing that's what they are most of the time
[02:08:58] yeah you know it's survivor biases yes yeah do you know what it is there things up it's like
[02:09:08] if you go out and you talk to 10 people that started companies and you say you know hey
[02:09:14] how hard was it started company they're all like yeah it's pretty easy man you're not talking
[02:09:18] to the 90 other people that failed so you get this survivor bias we get echelon from probably
[02:09:22] have a little bit of echelon front bias which is we move the companies that we work with they
[02:09:28] right extreme ownership they're in the game they listen to podcasts like these these are
[02:09:32] companies that have a good sort of fundamental value system so we we kind of have a little bit of
[02:09:41] that bias because you're right the amount of companies that we work with were I've said wow
[02:09:46] this guy is gonna put this product out there that's harmful or this guy or this woman is
[02:09:53] making a decision that's gonna cause their employees to suffer it doesn't happen it does now
[02:09:59] other companies like that yes there are and and but I would tell you same thing even though even
[02:10:05] with even if you take into account the EF bias the echelon front bias which is that most
[02:10:10] people that we work with have a good value system even without accounted for most companies
[02:10:15] these these days you have to have a good value system you have to be doing the right thing because
[02:10:20] there's just too much information out there and a damn yelp review I mean on the like this
[02:10:27] the base level hey if you run a restaurant and you treat your employees or your customers bad
[02:10:33] a yelp review now you go big and you run into you know the Wall Street Journal is doing an
[02:10:39] expose on what you did to maximize profits while you hurt your you know your your employees or
[02:10:46] your clients or whatever so so the even in cases where you have people that might not be the most
[02:10:53] altruistic people yeah the reality of modern technology keeps the vast majority of them in check
[02:11:00] yes so that's true the other thing is look there's gonna be these two these two things they create a
[02:11:06] nice positive natural tension that's what we want we want to have someone saying like hey
[02:11:11] yeah if you guys go to war we want you have the best gear that's good and the other the jett the
[02:11:15] the business should be saying hey if we want you to go to war we want you have the best gear and
[02:11:19] the general should be saying yeah we don't want to go to war but if we do we want the best gear
[02:11:23] there's a little tension these guys might want to go to war more these guys might not but
[02:11:28] there there should be a natural tension and I think what we have to watch out for is when there's no
[02:11:32] when people lose that when there's no tension when there's no one saying hey you know you know
[02:11:38] you know I just want you to think about something if we go to war it's Johnny over here that's
[02:11:42] gonna get killed that's gonna lose his legs whatever the case may be that's what we never that's what
[02:11:48] we need to make sure people think about and you know this goes back to one of the actually I
[02:11:52] think it might have been the first like everything that I got recorded saying was when we did the
[02:12:00] war fighters thing for the history channel about markedly and I've repeated this on a bunch of
[02:12:06] occasions well you know when it's time to go to war and it's time when you are willing you
[02:12:12] you are willing you have the will and but it's the will to die and it's the will to kill and that's
[02:12:17] what's gonna happen you're to war so you need to put that overlay on this yeah and if you ever
[02:12:21] forget about that overlay that you think well you know this is worth it because it's gonna be beneficial
[02:12:26] okay cool it's gonna be beneficial to the people there you know that we're gonna kill some of the
[02:12:29] people there not just the enemy but some of the people that are there are going to die because of us
[02:12:33] and we're going to have our own people killed that's what we need to think about we can never lose
[02:12:39] that tension and and I think that that tension does get lost I think that the people that that
[02:12:45] hold their hands they have a long way to second but what are we doing here and and part of the
[02:12:50] reason is because when is it there's a saying old men want to go to war and young men do too I mean
[02:12:58] you know it's that's a thing you survey freaking 19 year old kids that are in the Marine Corps
[02:13:03] and you ask them how many people how many you want to go to war and there's a big
[02:13:07] percentage that's coming through in the affirmative and that's the coolest part about the common
[02:13:12] about that tension which is I mean that's actually the tension that you want is I want I actually
[02:13:18] want Marines that want to go to war so I want them reason want to go to war and do I love the idea
[02:13:23] of rolepiece yes I love that idea I love that idea that idea is not going to happen today or tomorrow
[02:13:33] it's not going to happen and is as much as I love the fantasy of this the the simple things
[02:13:41] we need to do to to achieve that the the tension is you know with that reality too is that hey
[02:13:48] not only is that not likely there are people that actively do not want that actively do not
[02:13:53] want that and you know he I was he was talking about you know the next step is we're going to
[02:13:59] see war with chemicals and and he was sort of foreshadowing what then and he was correct obviously
[02:14:04] you know we we know that there is you know some of those things he saw that it won't work to the chemical
[02:14:08] warfare and he was foreshadowing this ever growing capacity for people to wage war against each other
[02:14:13] and these awful awful ways well you know you could get rid of all the weapons in the world and
[02:14:17] there's people waging wars computers now so this this this persistence of the reality
[02:14:25] even with some of the nefarious things and the profit here's the my path there there's a reality
[02:14:29] out there that we also need to accept and face and I want to be around people that want to do that
[02:14:35] I want to be around those people and I want Marines I want Marines that have that exact same feeling
[02:14:42] and yes you want to manage that and temper that and guide that and shape it yes all those things
[02:14:46] but I want to be around those people and I think that that tension that you talked about that
[02:14:51] natural tension because those two things exist in the world and to pretend like they don't is
[02:14:58] is not a good plan yeah I don't know what the percentage of people let's say you let's say you
[02:15:03] do what they said if you take the young man that are going to have to go to war and they get to vote
[02:15:09] I almost feel I almost don't feel super comfortable with that because I think a lot of them will be like oh yeah
[02:15:13] it's on here's my chance yeah it's on but I'm not sure that's also my own warped
[02:15:18] that's sort of the jockel bias which is I think everyone's kind of thinks like me which I know
[02:15:22] is not true there's also a chance that I'm wrong and a bunch of people would say no matter what
[02:15:26] was happening in the world maybe like no we're not going to war you know what I mean so you
[02:15:30] got to have somebody with a detached perspective yeah that's actually saying you know what now
[02:15:35] is not the time to go to war or a detached perspective and say hey we're looking at this whole thing
[02:15:40] we see Nazis we see them running rough shot all over we need to do something about this
[02:15:46] and you described it again I I you know when you call it the tensioner or this idea hey when
[02:15:52] you've got some skin in the game when it's not Johnny it's your Johnny when you're talking about
[02:15:57] who's going to war yeah I love that idea of oh you're talking about me now okay hang on let me
[02:16:05] let me put some thought into it because in the end the answer actually might still be yeah I'm
[02:16:08] gonna send my son off to war but I'm certainly gonna think about it a lot harder the closer it is
[02:16:14] to me and I mean that's been the challenge in society forever which was do we want to
[02:16:19] insulate our people for more yeah we do I want I want to insulate America for more and you could look
[02:16:23] it we talked about Afghanistan are there some good things that come out of that yeah absolutely
[02:16:28] and if you insulate them so much if you if you remove them so much that they don't even
[02:16:33] understand what really is happening those decisions actually aren't the best decisions because
[02:16:39] what are they care right yeah yeah it's a great idea go go go go to war
[02:16:44] doesn't affect me at all I don't want a society that has no impact on that either and even
[02:16:48] inside that you talk about the tension of I want to keep I want to separate us from that as much
[02:16:54] as possible but it's not but not so much that don't understand what it actually what what that
[02:16:58] really means is send somebody off to war we were just talking an hour ago when these people
[02:17:02] went to war war one to even know what they were doing they even know what it meant to send someone
[02:17:05] to war and there's just no way yeah there's some some great things with technology and and
[02:17:12] if you're doing something for the wrong reason it's pretty it's it's much harder to hide that now
[02:17:16] than it ever used to be if you're industrial plan or your company plan is really in affairs
[02:17:22] you're running the risk of getting found out there's just too much information that's free
[02:17:25] out there it's really hard to keep those secrets anymore but send somebody off to a war war
[02:17:29] one you think anybody really knew what that meant no and do I do think they should know a little bit
[02:17:34] yeah I see his point it's your kid going you might think twice before you send him put to
[02:17:40] like you said too they're actually times so you know say yeah because the alternative they're
[02:17:46] that's not acceptable well definitely I think the lesson here is keep your minds open
[02:17:54] and listen and try and understand these various perspectives that are out there because I bet
[02:18:02] there's a bunch of people that hear this nigga what that guy was a traitor or whatever they're
[02:18:07] going to say yeah or say yeah yeah and it's just that's just makes it so interesting because
[02:18:12] it can't call a guy that did what he did in his life a traitor and what we should actually do
[02:18:17] is listen that's what we should do with an open mind when an open mind goes a long way yeah
[02:18:24] with that echo Charles yes sir so we're trying to keep our minds open but we're also trying to
[02:18:30] keep our minds sharp yes sir keep sharp minds got to keep the vessel that the mind is contained
[02:18:38] and got to keep that kind of up and running sure concur the brain well yeah no we're the brain
[02:18:45] the brain is in the body sure let's call more specifically more specifically yep so you look at you
[02:18:52] yeah I'm trying yeah creative to my comments there was there was a there was a part in there where he was
[02:18:58] he was kind of going hard you know exposing all these profits and all this stuff and it makes sense man
[02:19:03] so and you can kind of get a taste of his emotional state right it makes sense but also you
[02:19:08] got to say hey man if I was having to fight the freaking Nazis how happy am I that I have some
[02:19:14] Americans steel manufacturer that is stay in awake 24 hours every scene that that when they used to
[02:19:18] build those liberty ships you know what I'm talking about Dave there's these big liberty ships
[02:19:23] that were used to transport stuff back and cross back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean
[02:19:27] yeah they were making them in a day a freaking whole ship bro this is impossible and America was
[02:19:33] doing it in a day now if I was over there on the front lines and I needed some more ammunition I would
[02:19:38] be so damn happy and I would be more than happy that people are making a bunch of money now the
[02:19:43] profits get a little bit extreme maybe they got a little extreme yeah so in that that's kind of
[02:19:49] the point there where you can kind of he goes hard in like both directions and you're like oh man
[02:19:54] I see I especially when he's talking about the waste you know like the ships that don't even run
[02:19:58] and it's like no we're still paying the bill and it's like and then meanwhile you know from his
[02:20:01] perspective he sees all the all the downside of war right hardcore and then he kind of see
[02:20:06] and he looks and he sees all these numbers all these dollar signs that go to other people
[02:20:10] whatever who are making shady ships and all this stuff oh man I get it but he went a little bit too
[02:20:15] hard and a button and even the in these little subtle way extreme extreme so he can make you
[02:20:20] shut it up about that little bit yes and and I was trying to stay like with you guys were like okay
[02:20:25] get it no no maybe not but there was a part he was talking about the boots right he was like
[02:20:29] all they made all these boots and like all this stuff whatever and I'm so thinking wait that's the
[02:20:34] we kind of need those boots but we only had 4 million soldiers and we bought 25 million boots
[02:20:39] yes okay and then that part it's like okay yes as far as the waste goes 100% that's going to
[02:20:43] apply across the board um and then he he went on to even add like oh those were good boots
[02:20:49] yeah yeah I was like yeah we need those boots yeah but we need the way of course we need the
[02:20:54] waste that's the same thing with the ships and all that stuff but so you could tell like all you
[02:20:59] get it is kind of detached from like that very specific perspective just a little bit in your
[02:21:03] like okay this kind of might not be getting it you know in certain ways well I don't think that's
[02:21:08] a great example because you can also say hey he gets it these are boots we need boots they're
[02:21:13] good boots they're probably lasting for a long time we didn't need 25 million pairs you know
[02:21:17] bro yeah it's true yeah so he he's getting it where he loses it is just saying that that's the
[02:21:23] only reason that they're doing it right and that's what I mean where and because that's it's
[02:21:27] seem like it put it this way it seemed like he was going hard in that direction it's like that's
[02:21:31] what he kind of wanted you to think yeah it's it also shows you that the you know you have a
[02:21:37] government organization that's running things and it's not your money yeah you're gonna get
[02:21:43] fraudwaste in abuse yeah that's why that's why it's usually better to have a little bit less
[02:21:51] government control over things yeah that's a cheap thing is decentralized is possible and I know
[02:21:57] I covered a little bit of of Thomas Sol's book I think I don't know if I even got to it it was I don't
[02:22:06] think you were on the podcast was with Jordan Peterson but he got this little section where he
[02:22:10] just talks about how freaking hard it is to like control price you just you can't you can't do it
[02:22:15] you can't control price has to do with the pelts of some animal and there's a worth a certain amount
[02:22:22] and then he goes through how hard it is to control the price and then he says in by the way there's
[02:22:27] whatever 1.2 billion products or line items that you need to control the price of it's impossible
[02:22:33] you gotta let the free market work a little bit and that's where you run into problems where you
[02:22:39] have the free market brush up against the government the government checkbook and they're like
[02:22:46] yeah we can make a you probably need 25 million boots how many soldiers you got 4 million
[02:22:53] sign here yeah it's true because you know like you would you get what the old thing the irresponsible
[02:23:00] person with a crew when they first get a credit card kind of feels like oh so my money right
[02:23:04] so then they overspend they can't pay that can stuff so it's like and like it makes sense that
[02:23:08] phenomenon does make sense people will spend their other people's money like crazy they do it all
[02:23:14] time that's where the government does the government spends other people's money all the time
[02:23:19] you know do we need to spend some money yeah yeah but if you looked at it from like a household
[02:23:25] perspective if this if this either this state wearing California or this country if you look
[02:23:32] at it from that standpoint of hey our budget you know we make you hey look here's hey you know
[02:23:39] hey darling life we make $5,000 a month that's how much income we bring in we're gonna buy a car
[02:23:47] that's gonna cost us $2,000 a month that we're gonna rent an apartment that's gonna cost us $4,000 a month
[02:23:55] and they're gonna go out to eat every night that total is gonna be $7,000 a month you can
[02:24:00] figure out real quick like oh I'm in the hole this is the credit card problem yeah so but if it's not
[02:24:05] our money yeah we're kind of like hey we're gonna do that a little bit so good yeah yeah well
[02:24:10] I don't think it's got to careful with this stuff yeah all right what do we got so speaking of being
[02:24:16] careful I like it we got to be careful with what we put in our bodies especially on this path the
[02:24:22] path is hard they broke I'm saying it's hard it's not always easy it's fun can be fun from time to
[02:24:29] time let's you when you're collecting those long-term gains seems to be capability cognitive enhancement
[02:24:36] smart all that stuff better decision making too either way we're on this path we want to stay
[02:24:41] healthy stay ahead of the game health wise day by notice you drinking the mango discipline good
[02:24:46] choice you could drink the orange could have but have a little bit of love hate relationship
[02:24:51] with the mango stand fully so discipline go that's what this is that's what we're talking about here
[02:24:56] it's a healthy energy drink yep it's a big deal most times energy drink as we know or as we
[02:25:04] knew oh I know where I'm gonna go with this right now where are you going well we were talking
[02:25:08] earlier about the fact that hey most companies are out there trying to do the right thing you
[02:25:14] know and guess what we have we have some companies that are out there saying oh you know what
[02:25:18] if I can cut the cost my product by a little bit add some chemicals to it that are a little bit cheaper
[02:25:25] give people an addictive thing called sugar and they'll just buy more of it cool so we got our
[02:25:32] example now we got some nefarious companies out there making poison and feeding it to people it's
[02:25:36] it's kind of a spectrum to and consider I'm not just saying necessarily energy drinks or whatever but
[02:25:41] like in general especially when it comes to stuff that you eat or bleeding about whatever because
[02:25:46] you're dealing with two different forces there yeah you don't know if you're talking about that though
[02:25:49] is this like is the attitude like yeah but that's what people want right that's what I'm saying
[02:25:54] there's two different forces and that's not a good that that's that's what people want that doesn't
[02:25:59] mean you can't just make adjustments to give them what they want and not give them poison
[02:26:04] hey some people want crack some people want some people want vodka straight up mainstream some
[02:26:10] people want vodka is vodka good is vodka good no kind of hard to make the argument on you know
[02:26:17] many many levels either way I dig where you're saying but guess what we don't have to worry
[02:26:20] about that can't stop anymore we are not in a various company we are making the clean the clean
[02:26:25] energy drink both uh win win upside short term upside long term in many ways too by the way
[02:26:31] this electrolytes in this one yeah imagine just being saying oh yeah you want to try something
[02:26:36] all upside all how often you get that in life you know here's something all upside yeah and
[02:26:43] as far as like the mango flavor is like really upside yeah that's what's interesting it's like
[02:26:48] it's compared to other flavors which is just normal upside which I understand of course
[02:26:53] either way if you want if you want to take part in this energy drink rather than the poison
[02:26:57] is starting to go down the path now we're now we're starting to talk about nefarious
[02:27:00] companies I'm going straight to the clothing manufacturers next that are out there cut in the
[02:27:05] corners and saying oh we'll just get this made in China we got slave labor over there we got the
[02:27:11] weegers over there in actual slave labor camps making your making your shorts how's that feel
[02:27:17] don't feel good no I don't feel good about it that's why you know what I don't get I don't get
[02:27:23] shorts that are made in China yeah I dig it but back to the energy drink okay you want to stick
[02:27:31] with those fermento and physical enhancements chance your capability also you can get stuff to
[02:27:41] to take you out of any kind of roadblocks or speed bumps in recovery we got protein we got stuff for
[02:27:50] your joints we got stuff for immunity we also got protein but you could actually just call it
[02:27:57] dessert yes another one of those if you don't have any emergency you have a day I thought I ran
[02:28:02] on a peanut butter wait peanut butter flavor milk peanut butter flavor milk yeah but then it
[02:28:08] was in the back of the Japanese but I was like speaking a crack yeah I look like a crack
[02:28:14] crack cocaine addict right and through yeah yeah yeah yeah I was one of my daughters just like
[02:28:22] went ham on the peanut butter yeah yeah and it was like down take out I got to you know half a scoop
[02:28:29] which is not gonna get you through the moment where you uh you mentioned your daughter and
[02:28:34] their older your kids are older my kind of young where I play tricks on them where they're not
[02:28:39] tricks it's a strategy it's the same so I don't give them milk when they want it I mean one it's
[02:28:45] like a reward yeah you seem saying he creates that that demand yeah same same so one they when they hit
[02:28:52] it boom that's the standard of the standard payoff of the dessert seem same meanwhile they're getting
[02:28:56] the the tail end of benefits same yeah that's a good idea I'm out of peanut butter by the way
[02:29:02] be little's on the case with the long one over your train that's for sure not you're going to
[02:29:06] much stuff where we get this stuff jockel fuel dot com also okay the energy drinks you can get
[02:29:10] it while while you can get it right in the shop you can get a jockel fuel dot com um the
[02:29:14] rest of the stuff mostly jockel fuel dot com and right in the shop yeah hey just real quick if you
[02:29:19] want it delivered if you don't want to run on a peanut butter milk or whatever else if you don't
[02:29:23] run out of dirt if you subscribe to it shipping's free so that's our way of competing with some other
[02:29:29] large corporations that may not be as benevolent the jockel fuel yeah it's a good move right there
[02:29:38] subscribe to percent also origin USA this is where you can get American made stuff you said it you mentioned
[02:29:43] it like some time a some places some some some of those that that some of the people where
[02:29:51] it's made with slave labor straight up and varying levels of slave slave labor to you can go
[02:29:55] deep in that rabbit hole find out some stuff they brought you know yeah you can go on
[02:29:59] not whatever those other youtube channels are that you were talking about you can watch
[02:30:02] you know little kids get beaten because they didn't produce enough freaking pairs of
[02:30:07] shorts yeah you can go deep for sure but without depressing anything but the
[02:30:12] factories where they got nets around them for some of the people trying to kill themselves
[02:30:16] they they hit the net and then they drag them back in and put them back in from the sewing machine
[02:30:22] yeah that was really scare I didn't know that that was real that's real yeah but that's a scary
[02:30:27] thing to consider like that's how common it is that they have a straight up SOP like a little
[02:30:33] protocol in the place oh yeah this is just to prevent the people from from actually dying one they
[02:30:38] try to commit suicide that's what we want another day and a half a little bit we need that
[02:30:42] labor seems same for this for clothes so we're not not down with that we're not that down with
[02:30:48] that so all this stuff is a made in America b made in America by people who want to make this
[02:30:53] this stuff they're so fired up like Brad just grab one person from there okay so you can and you can
[02:30:59] see this on their youtube channel by the way but you see the people making it they're probably
[02:31:03] like explained the whole thing yeah no but like oh yeah this one is this and this is the
[02:31:06] fact I saw one where they were saying hey I'm making this for this very specific person I was like
[02:31:10] dang help that's where I want to get my stuff from for sure or genus a dot com it's true
[02:31:16] lady America yeah jetz is still home in America yeah seeds jetzu stuff it boots by the way
[02:31:22] we have we made we sold the government 24 million pairs boots we haven't yet but even if we did
[02:31:28] we wouldn't sell them 24 million not necessarily out of they don't need to know especially because
[02:31:32] these boots are gonna last yeah so and you're gonna look good too let's face it yeah echo if
[02:31:40] yeah if echo ever goes into combat he's gonna be like he's gonna keep the point of
[02:31:45] the earth well that that's something that does have some value same same because I think
[02:31:52] a lot of people we care about like at the very least a little bit about what it looks like
[02:31:56] same same put on the Delta 68 it's not like I didn't look in the mirror I was like it's not
[02:32:01] like I was like you sure they fit and then just kind of walked out and just I looked in the mirror
[02:32:05] a little bit and in fact I remember what I read shirted and football and we're warming up for the
[02:32:11] game you know you can you can suit up for the game when you read shirt for football and the coach said
[02:32:18] he was like dang echo looks good and is uniform he's not ready to play but he looks good and is uniform

[02:34:30] is because I got to oh you got to be a ominous don't want to okay just a confirmed right
[02:34:35] there have been errors made in the past I think we don't need to bring them up right now but
[02:34:38] there have been things that have been created without approval and they were not correct
[02:34:43] all right well you know it's a risk we all run but yes that's correct and occasionally occasionally
[02:34:48] you know look I'm I'm prone to run the things a little bit too decentralized that's kind of what
[02:34:52] I do yes but occasionally let's do a little inspection to make sure we aren't
[02:34:57] making mistakes that we don't want to make what we call a QA quality of course sure it's on
[02:35:02] this before you print the shirt and send it to people you should do that yeah I think you might be
[02:35:06] right about that actually okay I understand what you're saying now yes I remember I remember
[02:35:10] Dave Birkin now actually Dave Birkin was a big part of that rectification okay yeah yeah
