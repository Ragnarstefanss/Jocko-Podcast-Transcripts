[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 30.
[00:00:04] With that go Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:10] And what we have this evening is straight Q&A, the last podcast that we did on the outstanding book
[00:00:22] called Boutoon Leader, a memoir of combat, of command in combat.
[00:00:28] It just took me a long time to get through.
[00:00:32] It's just a good book.
[00:00:35] And I just kept every time every page, I read it, I've got people got to hear that.
[00:00:42] People got to hear that.
[00:00:43] People got to hear that.
[00:00:44] The next thing you know, you're two and a half hours deep.
[00:00:48] And since so much of it was pertain to leadership, there was commentary with each section.
[00:00:54] And it was like, oh yeah, you know, this is what's going on here.
[00:00:56] And I recognize that and I wish I would have known that and that could have helped me here.
[00:01:01] So it went a little long.
[00:01:05] And that made us decide to just go ahead and turn that into one podcast.
[00:01:13] And now here we are coming back at you with a podcast number 30, which is straight Q&A.
[00:01:21] Yeah, there wasn't really one part of that book review that I was like, oh, you could have left that out.
[00:01:25] No, in the industry, we call that getting after.
[00:01:31] Indeed.
[00:01:32] So let's, let's take into some Q&A here.
[00:01:36] Some questions that we've been asked.
[00:01:39] You going to kick this one off?
[00:01:40] Yes, sir.
[00:01:41] Ego Drone.
[00:01:42] Yes, sir.
[00:01:43] Question number one.
[00:01:44] First question.
[00:01:45] Jocco, as an aid decamp, what were your duties?
[00:01:50] What did you learn?
[00:01:52] And why does that position still exist in the 21st century military?
[00:01:56] Well, the aid decamp.
[00:01:58] Okay, so first of all, an aid decamp is something in the military that it's only also
[00:02:05] to put it in a very simple way that people could understand it from.
[00:02:11] It's an assistant.
[00:02:12] It's like an executive assistant where, for me, I was, I was the admiral that's in charge
[00:02:19] of all the seals.
[00:02:22] I was his assistant.
[00:02:24] You know, that's what an aid decamp is.
[00:02:26] Now, the question is why does that position still exist or what, you know, what did you learn
[00:02:33] while I learned a ton?
[00:02:35] No doubt about that.
[00:02:36] Why does the position still exist?
[00:02:37] I think it's absolutely necessary.
[00:02:39] It's not fun.
[00:02:40] It's not a fun job.
[00:02:42] And I work for a great guy.
[00:02:44] But if you're working for something that's not a great guy, it's miserable.
[00:02:47] And even working for a great guy, it's not exactly the dream job.
[00:02:51] It wasn't for me.
[00:02:52] So here's what you do.
[00:02:55] The boss, which is what we call, this is what we called the admiral.
[00:02:59] We called him the boss, right?
[00:03:01] So what we did was what I did was the boss is always traveling.
[00:03:06] I'm going different places, going to the Pentagon, going to visit outstations, going overseas,
[00:03:11] going just constantly going on travel and visiting people and visiting troops.
[00:03:15] And so I was the guy that set up that travel.
[00:03:20] That's what I did.
[00:03:21] And then, you know, communicating with whatever you're going to visit.
[00:03:25] Like, hey, the admiral's coming in.
[00:03:27] You know, what do you want us to do?
[00:03:29] Is there anything we need to be had?
[00:03:30] Zupon.
[00:03:31] So we take care of all that and set it up and make sure that the travel smooth.
[00:03:37] Because he's a really busy guy.
[00:03:38] It's like a CEO.
[00:03:39] He's like the CEO of a big giant, powerful worldwide company.
[00:03:44] That's what he is.
[00:03:45] And so you're trying to make the most of his time, make sure not wasting his time during
[00:03:49] travel.
[00:03:50] And so that's what I did.
[00:03:52] So that's part of it.
[00:03:53] And the other piece that's cool is you're kind of like an attrusted advisor or you
[00:04:02] try and build the trust so that he trust you.
[00:04:04] And they they usually, in our case, usually often try to find guys that come back from
[00:04:09] the front lines and use them as the aid.
[00:04:15] So I had when I became the aid, it was actually my commanding officer.
[00:04:20] He, who's a friend of mine and who's a great guy that always took care of me.
[00:04:27] And he told me he said, hey, my final mission as the commanding officer of Seal Team 7 is
[00:04:34] to make sure that you become the aid to the admiral.
[00:04:39] And you know, I wasn't happy about it.
[00:04:41] Because again, it's an administrative job.
[00:04:45] It's you have to wear uniform every day.
[00:04:47] Which was this 2005.
[00:04:52] And but it was, it was a good call that the that my commanding officer may be going to do
[00:04:59] it because I did learn a ton.
[00:05:01] You know, you, you, I've been in the micro world of being a seal platoon for my whole life.
[00:05:07] Right.
[00:05:08] So that's all I did.
[00:05:09] So you had to know anything else.
[00:05:10] I didn't understand anything else.
[00:05:12] So when you go off a Sunday, you're dealing with not only do you see the big picture of
[00:05:15] the seal teams, but I saw the big picture of the army and the special operations command.
[00:05:20] And big navy, like the regular navy, we interacted with them a lot.
[00:05:23] So I got to learn a ton.
[00:05:25] I learned a ton about what?
[00:05:27] I learned it's sort of like seeing behind the curtain.
[00:05:31] You know, you get to see behind the curtain of the wizard and what's going on in the chambers.
[00:05:36] And basically, you know, like how they make the sausage, you revert that term, you know,
[00:05:41] they say when they make sausage, that you'll eat the sausage, it tastes good, but you
[00:05:45] don't want to see how they make it.
[00:05:47] So that's I got to see how they make the sausage.
[00:05:49] I got to see behind the curtain.
[00:05:51] And I learned a ton of that, you know, I got to sit like there was meetings that I would
[00:05:56] sit in super high level meetings with very powerful people in the meetings.
[00:06:01] And I would just be sitting there listening and seeing how these judgments were being made.
[00:06:06] And assessing the leadership and seeing what type of leaders we had at the highest levels
[00:06:11] of the Pentagon.
[00:06:13] And as I was pretty, it was pretty interesting.
[00:06:16] And I definitely learned a lot.
[00:06:18] It was not fun because like I said, there was a ton of travel.
[00:06:24] You're wearing a uniform all the time, which seals are pretty well known for not wanting
[00:06:32] to wear uniforms, real uniforms.
[00:06:34] And there I'd probably worn a uniform, a very small number of times.
[00:06:39] I'm talking to my whole naval career, a dress uniform.
[00:06:42] I'd probably worn one 15 times.
[00:06:47] I don't know the number, but it's a tiny number.
[00:06:50] And I was on the mat, working for the Admiral.
[00:06:52] I'm wearing a uniform every single day.
[00:06:54] And there were sometimes we'd go on a trip and I'd have to wear, if there's multiple
[00:06:57] different dress uniforms in the Navy and most of the services, we'd go on some
[00:07:01] board I'd have to bring two or three different dress uniforms.
[00:07:06] So my uniforms were always ready.
[00:07:07] That was one thing that not too many people could claim as you get really good at your
[00:07:11] uniforms.
[00:07:15] But there's also some things that are pretty restrictive.
[00:07:17] For instance, you're actually not allowed to do personal favors for the boss.
[00:07:27] Like I wasn't allowed.
[00:07:29] Is this idea, because they're very cautious that the military senior people might abuse
[00:07:34] people in the military?
[00:07:36] And like I wasn't allowed, for instance, I wasn't allowed to go pick up his laundry.
[00:07:43] Like if you got his uniforms pressed and clean, I wasn't allowed to go and run to the
[00:07:49] store and pick it up if we were going on a trip or something.
[00:07:51] Like it wasn't allowed to do it.
[00:07:53] We weren't allowed to fly first class.
[00:07:55] If there was only one time we flew first class, that was when we get upgrades after
[00:08:01] a while because we were traveling so much.
[00:08:03] But so both you guys couldn't, or just the AD camp.
[00:08:08] No, neither one of us.
[00:08:10] We wouldn't fly first class.
[00:08:12] Yeah, it's the military sort of, you know, we don't want to, they don't want to
[00:08:19] be fraudwaste in abuse.
[00:08:21] Which is actually ridiculous.
[00:08:22] This guy's the equivalent of a CEO of a big company.
[00:08:25] And they wouldn't get the guy first class to get stuff fly from San Diego to Washington,
[00:08:29] DC to go to the Pentagon and brief some senior government's leadership.
[00:08:33] Yeah, fully, that's a good philosophy.
[00:08:34] They don't waste.
[00:08:35] Yeah, I know it's a good philosophy, but they should have, I think he'd earn at that point.
[00:08:40] Right.
[00:08:41] 30 something years in the Navy.
[00:08:43] Yeah, for that service, country and just be, you know, hey, you know what, this guy
[00:08:47] should be well rested when he shows up to brief Congress.
[00:08:50] Yeah.
[00:08:51] You know, so that was that. And then the reason I think it's necessary again is because
[00:08:56] you got you take a guy, you know, the, the, the admiral, they're, they're not going to
[00:09:01] usually, you're often may not have been in recent combat situations.
[00:09:06] And so this aide that's coming in, he's coming off the battlefield.
[00:09:09] So he can say, hey, so he was going on here.
[00:09:10] Hey, sir, this is what this is like, hey, sir, this is some gear that we need up on the
[00:09:14] front lines.
[00:09:15] Hey, sir, this is what the front line troopers think about this program that we're doing,
[00:09:19] or this rule that's being imposed upon us, we need to change this.
[00:09:24] So we need to get it fixed.
[00:09:26] So I had a great relationship with with with the boss when I was running that job.
[00:09:29] And it was very beneficial for me on my next appointment when I deployed Ramani.
[00:09:35] And I knew the admiral.
[00:09:36] Mm-hmm.
[00:09:37] I mean, it was, you know, he's the guy that's in charge of all seals.
[00:09:41] And there I was in Ramani.
[00:09:43] And you know, there was times where we talked directly, you know,
[00:09:48] he called me up and say, hey, what's going on, or you know, after my guy's got killed,
[00:09:54] he called me up directly.
[00:09:56] And that really meant a lot to me.
[00:09:59] And I think he meant a lot to him too, because he had a connection with the guys that were
[00:10:03] out there, because he knew me and knew, you know, knew me well.
[00:10:07] So I think that was, I think I was very important.
[00:10:10] And I think it's a, it's a good job.
[00:10:12] I'm not going to say you're going to like it.
[00:10:14] If there's troopers out there that are up for that job, you're not going to like it.
[00:10:18] If you're, if you're a hard-court, get an after kind of guy, you're not going to like the job.
[00:10:23] The people that actually in the scary thing is that people that volunteer and want to have
[00:10:27] that job are usually the guys, the animals don't want, because that's a guy that's like
[00:10:30] focused on advancing his career.
[00:10:32] And hey, if I'm coming, coming in aid, then I'll know the admiral.
[00:10:35] And so you're not going to, those of the guys, the admiral's actually, at least the admiral
[00:10:38] I work for, he didn't want any guys like that.
[00:10:40] He wanted guys that were going to say, oh, I, I want a guy that's going to come kicking and
[00:10:44] screaming to this job.
[00:10:45] Yeah.
[00:10:46] Because he doesn't want to, it's where it uniform.
[00:10:50] He wants to be in the field.
[00:10:51] I want to be in the field.
[00:10:52] So that's kind of the AD camp.
[00:10:55] So if there's a trooper out there that's going to get pushed in that position, you know,
[00:10:59] you might have to do it.
[00:11:01] And, and when you do it, you do the best that you can.
[00:11:05] When, when the guy that took over for me, he said, because I was, you know, I was, I've
[00:11:13] always been early to work.
[00:11:14] Well, when I was working for the boss, I was even earlier because this is, you know, I've felt
[00:11:18] this, this responsibility that, you know, I got to take care of this guy.
[00:11:21] He's taking care of all the seals.
[00:11:22] I got to take care of him.
[00:11:23] Right?
[00:11:24] This guy, the more the easier I make his job, the easier I make his life, the more he can
[00:11:29] focus on taking care of all the guys that are in the field and all the seals.
[00:11:34] And so when I, I was get show up even earlier than I would normally show up and I was
[00:11:39] double in triple in quadruple check everything that was going on.
[00:11:43] And when the guy came, it to relieve me and take my place.
[00:11:48] And he said, he said, you know, hey, how does the, how does the boss react if you drop
[00:11:54] the ball on something?
[00:11:57] And I said, I don't know.
[00:12:00] I don't know.
[00:12:01] I, I didn't drop the ball.
[00:12:03] I mean, that's, that was, you know, a lot of luck involved.
[00:12:06] And I had some, some other guys that were with me that really helped me out, you know,
[00:12:11] one guy in particular is a civilian guy that is, is steady, works, there has always worked
[00:12:16] there and worked there for a long time and he was always covered in my tracks and helped
[00:12:19] me not drop the ball, but he, I never dropped the ball.
[00:12:23] You know, it's kind of a good answer to that question.
[00:12:26] Like, because, you know, if you're like, oh, hey, well, he doesn't take it so hard.
[00:12:30] Almost like the might plant something in his mind where it may not be as important every
[00:12:34] single time or something.
[00:12:35] That's important every time you can't drop the ball.
[00:12:37] Yes.
[00:12:38] You gotta keep it going.
[00:12:42] Is it ever viewed by, by people, whatever that job is like, kind of emasculating or something
[00:12:44] because you're like, like, like an assistant more so than, you know, I don't know.
[00:12:49] I maybe, maybe somebody views it that way.
[00:12:51] Yeah.
[00:12:52] You know, I will, I will military guy that got tasked with a job to take care of the senior
[00:12:56] seal officer and keep his day moving so that he can take care of the troops.
[00:13:01] I don't, I think that's beneficial.
[00:13:03] I, right?
[00:13:04] I didn't, I didn't feel that way.
[00:13:05] The other thing is you're not, like I said, you're not allowed to do certain things.
[00:13:09] Well, you're not allowed to do personal things form and even, and the guy that I work for
[00:13:17] was very laid back and, I mean, and part of the reason he was laid back was because I never
[00:13:23] dropped the ball from him.
[00:13:24] I wouldn't want to drop the ball because I'm sure he would be angry.
[00:13:28] Yeah.
[00:13:29] But, yeah, it wasn't a bad job.
[00:13:32] Yeah.
[00:13:33] But, I would think if you understand the value of the job, really understand the value
[00:13:38] of a job, you probably will never really feel emasculator or anything.
[00:13:43] But I think, you know, sometimes some of us can go into jobs and be like, you know,
[00:13:49] I'm a leader, I'm not a helper.
[00:13:52] You know, kind of kind of attitude.
[00:13:54] Yeah.
[00:13:55] Well, it's interesting too because when you're working for the admiral, then when you speak,
[00:14:00] you kind of kind of, you kind of speak for the admiral.
[00:14:04] So in other words, when I'd go into talk to some senior captains and I said, hey, can I get
[00:14:09] a copy of XYZ?
[00:14:11] They knew it wasn't me that wanted it.
[00:14:12] They knew it was the boss that wanted it.
[00:14:14] So people are snapping too.
[00:14:15] So it was pretty, it was interesting from that perspective.
[00:14:18] You know, all the young lieutenant at the time, I'd go in and say, hey, can we get this,
[00:14:23] we need this report?
[00:14:25] And the guy's going to be like jumping to like full captains would be jumping to because
[00:14:27] they knew that it wasn't for me and they respected the boss and they wanted to help
[00:14:31] them out.
[00:14:32] So it was, you do, you get a little bit of added weight because people know, especially
[00:14:38] because people kind of knew we had a good relationship.
[00:14:41] And so they knew that if I was asking for something or I needed something or I was suggesting
[00:14:44] something, they knew where I was coming from.
[00:14:47] They knew it was coming from the big boss man.
[00:14:49] So it was kind of like, like, the executive assistant to like Oprah or something.
[00:14:55] Well, no, there you go.
[00:15:00] We're not going to talk about the person that you just talked about on this podcast.
[00:15:04] It's not happening.
[00:15:06] I gotcha.
[00:15:08] There, there.
[00:15:11] I'm just saying, you know, if you go around and you're like, hey, I need.
[00:15:17] I would say it would be the equivalent of being the executive assistant to a very powerful
[00:15:22] CEO that has a lot of stress and decisions to make and has a large global corporation.
[00:15:32] Yeah.
[00:15:33] In their under their command.
[00:15:35] Actually, that kind of reminds me of the whole flying first class thing.
[00:15:39] And I thought about this where there was a big part of me that thought, oh, yeah, a lot
[00:15:42] of guys, they'll just fly first class just because that's like a sadist thing.
[00:15:46] And like, oh, yeah, I'm this high.
[00:15:47] So I get to, you kind of live in this luxury.
[00:15:50] But flying first class eliminates a lot of stress and a lot of like decision making and
[00:15:58] headaches, you know, we're contending with certain things.
[00:16:00] Yeah.
[00:16:01] So when you arrive, you have way less on your mind.
[00:16:03] So, and that's a lot.
[00:16:06] You ever had to do something or convey some important message, but you have a lot on your
[00:16:10] mind, some other stuff.
[00:16:11] It makes it way harder.
[00:16:12] Yeah, then I just prioritize an execute.
[00:16:14] Yeah.
[00:16:15] I know, but it has its function is what I'm saying.
[00:16:19] It does.
[00:16:20] And there was the time that the literally the one time we were authorized and executed
[00:16:29] a first class travel was when we flew to Europe.
[00:16:32] And when we arrived at six o'clock in the morning, the boss or seven o'clock in the morning,
[00:16:36] the boss was talking to the troops half an hour later.
[00:16:40] And then the whole day was scheduled about talking to the local senior leadership.
[00:16:44] So he needed to be arrested when he showed up there.
[00:16:47] Now, me on the other hand, if I remember correctly, I was in the chief seat.
[00:16:52] But you don't really need that much rest.
[00:16:54] Because you're saying that.
[00:16:55] Young Lieutenant can just suck it up.
[00:16:57] Because it is pretty pathetic.
[00:16:59] We're sitting here talking about first class.
[00:17:00] Do we, you know what?
[00:17:01] Let's just talk about Bob Hoffman.
[00:17:03] Do you know what I mean?
[00:17:04] Well, war won.
[00:17:04] Trench warfare.
[00:17:05] Yeah, he used to worry about flying first class.
[00:17:08] Yeah, and he had a lot of decisions to me.
[00:17:10] Yeah.
[00:17:11] So let's just suck it up.
[00:17:12] I'm stuck it up.
[00:17:13] All right.
[00:17:14] That's a question.
[00:17:16] Marco, do you have a suggestion for Marshall Art for a wheelchair user?
[00:17:20] I'm considering FMA, just Filipino martial arts or Krav Maga.
[00:17:26] I want exercise and self defense.
[00:17:29] Well, again, this is as usual.
[00:17:36] My first suggestion for true self defense to protect yourself from the world.
[00:17:46] And the evils of the world concealed caring.
[00:17:51] You know, get a weapon or not a shoot a weapon spend time at the range train train with
[00:17:55] it is a mart.
[00:17:57] Shooting a weapon is a martial art.
[00:17:58] Carrying a weapon is a martial art.
[00:18:01] Knowing how to use that weapon in various situations, it is a martial art.
[00:18:05] So shooting is a martial art.
[00:18:08] And so that's the most effective martial art to know and to have the possession of
[00:18:15] the weapon is concealed carry weapons.
[00:18:19] So again, I'm not saying that just because this individual's in a wheelchair.
[00:18:26] Because, I mean, obviously being in a wheelchair does put you at a disadvantage.
[00:18:34] But it doesn't matter wheelchair or not.
[00:18:38] There's always going to be somebody that's bigger and better than you.
[00:18:41] And if there's not somebody that's bigger and better than you, then there's three or four
[00:18:44] people come by and together that make a person that's better than you.
[00:18:47] That's called a gang.
[00:18:49] And I will tell you right now, any three people in the world can beat anyone in the world
[00:18:57] of the night.
[00:18:58] Like three on one, you're going to lose.
[00:19:01] Oh, okay.
[00:19:02] Now, can you get a guy that knocks him or somebody out turns around?
[00:19:05] I mean, it does happen.
[00:19:06] But if people that are attacking know anything, you have a really bad chance, really
[00:19:12] bad chance of winning.
[00:19:13] It's very tough to win a fight three on one.
[00:19:16] So train with firearms, get a gun.
[00:19:20] And you know also, and you mentioned the Filipino martial arts.
[00:19:23] And I sometimes fail to mention this to carry a knife.
[00:19:28] But yeah, you should absolutely have a knife.
[00:19:30] You should know how to use it.
[00:19:32] So that is your Filipino martial arts generally, learning to use a knife and carry a knife.
[00:19:40] And then what am I going to do after that?
[00:19:43] I'm going to do the same thing I was talking about.
[00:19:45] Do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?
[00:19:47] Kind of in that order.
[00:19:49] Now, do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?
[00:19:52] We start with jujitsu.
[00:19:53] We move on to boxing.
[00:19:54] We learn wrestling and boy learn more tie.
[00:19:56] Sometimes, boy tie and wrestling, you can flip back and forth, which one you want to focus
[00:19:59] on.
[00:20:00] The deal is with all three of those.
[00:20:02] You have to adapt them to the situation that you're in.
[00:20:06] Whatever that situation is.
[00:20:08] Now, if you're in a wheelchair, I don't know what this is going to look like for you.
[00:20:11] I don't know what that looks like.
[00:20:13] You've got to learn it.
[00:20:14] You've got to understand it.
[00:20:15] You've got to make things work.
[00:20:16] You've got to figure it out.
[00:20:17] You've got to test it.
[00:20:18] You've got to see what's effective.
[00:20:19] And you've got to see what isn't effective.
[00:20:23] And you have to adapt.
[00:20:25] You have to adapt.
[00:20:26] And I've trained with all kinds of different people.
[00:20:30] And have their own obstacles to overcome.
[00:20:36] I've trained with guys that have amputees, misinone, leg, two legs, misinorms.
[00:20:43] I've trained with people that are blind.
[00:20:45] I've trained with people that are paralyzed.
[00:20:48] I've trained with people with traumatic brain injuries.
[00:20:53] And they all work and try and figure away.
[00:20:57] And they do figure ways.
[00:20:58] You've got kind of like a Kyle Manard.
[00:21:01] Do you know who that is?
[00:21:02] Yes, they do.
[00:21:03] He's got norms and no legs.
[00:21:06] And he trains due to and he wrestled in high school.
[00:21:09] He competed and he competed in due to.
[00:21:12] He's actually competed in MMA as well, which is crazy.
[00:21:17] But you know what?
[00:21:19] He adapts to the situation that he's in.
[00:21:23] And there's Anthony Robles.
[00:21:28] He's in C.D.
[00:21:30] NC.
[00:21:31] AA, 125 pound champion.
[00:21:36] Champion.
[00:21:37] And by the way, he has one leg.
[00:21:39] I mean one leg.
[00:21:40] His other leg is gone from the hip down.
[00:21:43] One leg.
[00:21:44] And he won the NC AA Championship.
[00:21:47] That's incredible.
[00:21:51] And he just did that.
[00:21:52] He got John Jacques Mishado.
[00:21:53] He's got one hand, Jeff Rial.
[00:21:56] Jeff Rial.
[00:21:57] He's trains with us.
[00:21:58] He's got one hand.
[00:22:00] His other hand's gone.
[00:22:01] He was born with no hand.
[00:22:03] Oh, guess what?
[00:22:04] Now all you just you players out there that you think about when you're doing you just
[00:22:08] with the G.
[00:22:09] And think of how much you grab.
[00:22:10] When you're trading with Jeff, you don't even know that he doesn't have a hand.
[00:22:13] He just don't even know.
[00:22:14] He just does other stuff.
[00:22:16] He's adapted to it.
[00:22:17] As a matter of fact, he uses that stomp to choke you in attack you.
[00:22:21] He gets in there.
[00:22:22] Yeah, he sneaks that thing in there.
[00:22:27] We have a max, max a million.
[00:22:29] Yeah, yeah, max right.
[00:22:31] Max, he's paralyzed.
[00:22:33] But and that's recent too.
[00:22:35] So yeah, yeah.
[00:22:36] You know, he got paralyzed.
[00:22:38] What?
[00:22:39] Three years, five or four years ago?
[00:22:40] Something like that.
[00:22:41] Yeah.
[00:22:42] He was like maybe a white belt.
[00:22:43] Maybe a bean belt.
[00:22:44] He's a blue belt.
[00:22:45] I think he's a purple now.
[00:22:46] Yeah, I think he's a purple now.
[00:22:47] But I mean, he's got basically, I think it's about sternum down.
[00:22:51] He's completely paralyzed sternum down.
[00:22:53] Yeah.
[00:22:54] And he's so he's figured out he actually has to move his legs.
[00:22:58] You know, like he, when he's when you're rolling with him, he's got to grab his legs
[00:23:00] and move him into different positions, which is crazy.
[00:23:05] But he's still training.
[00:23:06] He's advancing and he's learning to adapt.
[00:23:08] He knows how to choke you.
[00:23:10] He's figured things out.
[00:23:13] So whether you're shorter, tall, bigger, small, old, their yugs, stronger, weak,
[00:23:20] wheelchair, no wheelchair, leg, no leg, learn it, learn it all.
[00:23:27] And start with you, Jitsu, learn some boxing, some mojitai, then wrestling.
[00:23:31] And then once you get that base built up, start looking at crawvmogastar, looking at
[00:23:35] kali.
[00:23:36] So you can learn, you know, if you want to learn weapons, and obviously from the beginning,
[00:23:43] the firearm trumps everything.
[00:23:45] Yeah.
[00:23:46] Yeah, especially when you're training with, like any kind of distance,
[00:23:49] advantage or whatever, I think it's important to understand what your potential goal will
[00:23:55] be in a self-defense situation.
[00:23:57] So if you're, you know, like if you don't have legs like Max, for example, like you
[00:24:02] can learn a lot of stuff that is just defensive.
[00:24:07] And if you know Jitsu, and I'm a son like a Jitsu advocate, which I am.
[00:24:13] But if you learn Jitsu, you'll learn how to be defensive, how you can shut down another
[00:24:19] guy's attacks.
[00:24:20] And he's so like I said, like if you're, like your disadvantage is pretty big, just understand
[00:24:25] what your goals will be in a potential self-defense situation.
[00:24:30] You know, so you're not going to be like, okay, I'm going to learn these martial arts.
[00:24:34] So I can kick as much ass as I possibly can.
[00:24:37] Yeah, that's the point.
[00:24:38] The point of this is that you have to adapt.
[00:24:43] You have to adapt.
[00:24:44] You have to say, okay, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:24:46] And this is, I can't do that move, but I can do this move.
[00:24:48] And by the way, you can't do this, but I can do that.
[00:24:50] Yes.
[00:24:51] And you know, like we were just talking about Jeffrey, all the Jeffrey Alzagai trained with
[00:24:54] the most regularly out of these folks.
[00:24:56] And he has adapted and does things that you, that is totally unique to him.
[00:25:03] And he makes an event.
[00:25:04] He takes a disadvantage, turns it into an advantage.
[00:25:06] You know, yeah, there's an MMA guy who was the champ and one of these shows, I forget.
[00:25:11] I might have been bellotaur, maybe.
[00:25:13] I don't know, I forget.
[00:25:14] But he used, he had one hand too, he used the champ though.
[00:25:19] I think one, how do I know who that is?
[00:25:21] I forget his name too, but it was wild.
[00:25:23] It's like maybe a year ago or something or more.
[00:25:25] A while ago a year.
[00:25:26] And it's been around for 20 plus years.
[00:25:28] Right.
[00:25:29] But in America.
[00:25:30] The current champ is always seem so new.
[00:25:34] Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:25:36] That is definitely outstanding to see people overcome that.
[00:25:41] And in what you can do.
[00:25:44] You just gotta have that, that, that, the creative mind to get in there and adapt to the situation.
[00:25:53] Yeah.
[00:25:54] And it goes along with kind of what I think it was, I forget to.
[00:25:59] But how they say, you know, a little exercise is better than no exercise, you know?
[00:26:04] So sometimes like if you find yourself in a wheelchair or something like this, where it'll
[00:26:08] be like, oh yeah, that's not for me.
[00:26:10] But this obviously is for him.
[00:26:12] You know?
[00:26:13] And like how you say, like, learn something or learn it all, whatever.
[00:26:17] That's better than not knowing nothing.
[00:26:18] No way better too.
[00:26:20] Yeah, this.
[00:26:21] Especially that.
[00:26:22] Especially that.
[00:26:23] Yeah.
[00:26:24] Good.
[00:26:25] Good after it.
[00:26:26] That's it.
[00:26:27] Next question.
[00:26:28] Jockel.
[00:26:29] Mr. Jockel.
[00:26:31] Whenever I get mentally overwhelmed, I shut down completely.
[00:26:35] How do I counter that?
[00:26:37] Well, the first thing and the first good step that you've already made is you've identified
[00:26:43] this is an issue.
[00:26:44] You recognize the fact that you shut down.
[00:26:46] That's step number one in solving your problems identifying your problem.
[00:26:49] So excellent work there.
[00:26:51] The next step is actually pretty easy as well.
[00:26:53] You've identified the fact that you shut down.
[00:26:55] The next step that you're going to do is not shut down.
[00:26:59] Not mentally shut down.
[00:27:00] That's what you want to do.
[00:27:01] If you start to shut down and you feel yourself freezing up, say, I'm not going to shut
[00:27:06] down right now.
[00:27:07] I'm going to attack this issue.
[00:27:08] Now, the reason that you're getting overwhelmed most likely is because there's a lot
[00:27:14] of different things flying at you at the same time and they're all happening at once.
[00:27:18] And it's problematic for you.
[00:27:20] We have a very simple solution for that.
[00:27:21] It's prioritizing execute.
[00:27:23] So what is the biggest problem that you've got going on?
[00:27:25] Let's identify what that biggest problem is.
[00:27:27] Then let's attack that problem and get it solved.
[00:27:29] Once we got that one solved, we can move on to the next one.
[00:27:31] Once we get to take care of that one, we can move on to the next one.
[00:27:34] We go right on down the line.
[00:27:36] That's what we do.
[00:27:39] That's very simple.
[00:27:40] You know that you're going to get overwhelmed.
[00:27:43] First of all, tell yourself you're not going to go overwhelmed.
[00:27:46] Then you actually don't get overwhelmed.
[00:27:48] And how do you not get overwhelmed?
[00:27:49] You prioritize an execute.
[00:27:53] If you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, do what I did to the platoon commander
[00:27:59] that I had that was getting all freaked out during a humv, I had just immediate action drills
[00:28:08] where you're patrolling through the desert.
[00:28:10] And we have electrical targets that pop up and then you, everyone starts shooting at the
[00:28:15] targets.
[00:28:16] And this guy was locking up and not making any decisions even though he's the leader.
[00:28:22] And this is the one where I took a magic marker and I wrote on this Sharpie right in front
[00:28:25] of his face on the humv window.
[00:28:27] I said, next time the shooting starts, here's what I want you to do.
[00:28:31] Number one, relax.
[00:28:34] Number two, look around.
[00:28:35] Number three, make a call.
[00:28:37] It's really easy.
[00:28:38] So step number one when you're getting overwhelmed, relax.
[00:28:42] Relax.
[00:28:43] Breathe, take a step back.
[00:28:45] Just take a step back.
[00:28:47] The red flags start going off in your head and you're realizing that you're getting overwhelmed
[00:28:52] and you're going to get shut down.
[00:28:54] No.
[00:28:55] Take a step back, relax.
[00:29:00] And then prioritize next Q pretty simple.
[00:29:04] Make a call.
[00:29:05] Yeah.
[00:29:06] Yeah, it's good.
[00:29:07] Simple.
[00:29:08] Next question.
[00:29:09] Let's do it.
[00:29:13] What technique do you use to not lose your temper with your life?
[00:29:18] Oh, when you know she's wrong and refuses to budge, well this is kind of a, this question
[00:29:24] is actually moved because my life is never wrong.
[00:29:30] So number one, losing your temper.
[00:29:32] Losing your temper is weak.
[00:29:37] It's actually weak.
[00:29:38] It's actually weak to lose your temper.
[00:29:40] It actually is a loss of control when you lose your temper and losing control was also
[00:29:47] weak.
[00:29:49] So we don't want to lose our temper.
[00:29:51] That's one of our goals.
[00:29:53] So again, just like prioritize next Q, what do you do?
[00:29:56] You start feeling yourself losing your temper.
[00:29:58] Stop.
[00:29:59] Take a step back to attach from it, breathe.
[00:30:03] And then you've got to think about the long term victory.
[00:30:07] And we've talked about this before.
[00:30:09] We've talked about this before.
[00:30:11] Proving that you're right to your wife is not necessarily the best goal to have.
[00:30:20] What you want to do is you want to.
[00:30:22] You want to win the war.
[00:30:25] Not that one battle, but one battle doesn't even matter.
[00:30:29] I mean, what is this stupid argument about anyways?
[00:30:33] It's not about something that matters.
[00:30:35] It isn't.
[00:30:36] I can almost guarantee it's not about something that matters.
[00:30:38] It's about some random thing that doesn't matter in the big picture at all.
[00:30:44] So why are you getting upset about it?
[00:30:48] Why are you losing control?
[00:30:49] Why are you losing your temper?
[00:30:50] You can't do that.
[00:30:52] You can't do that.
[00:30:54] So when you feel like you're coming up against the, this is Sun Siu.
[00:30:59] You're going against a heavily defended position.
[00:31:01] Don't attack the heavily defended position.
[00:31:04] If your wife is not admitting that she's wrong, she's refusing to budge.
[00:31:07] What are you doing?
[00:31:08] What are you attacking?
[00:31:10] You're actually attacking a heavily defended position.
[00:31:13] Sun Siu told you not to do that.
[00:31:14] 2,500 years ago and it holds two to this day.
[00:31:18] So what are you going to do when they're not budging?
[00:31:20] You're going to flank them.
[00:31:23] You're going to flank them.
[00:31:25] You're going to move around to the outside and come in from another angle that they weren't
[00:31:29] expecting.
[00:31:32] You know, maybe that other angle looks like flowers.
[00:31:36] Maybe the other angle looks like dinner.
[00:31:38] Maybe it looks like maybe it just looks like change in the subject to something that they
[00:31:41] can be more flexible mentally on.
[00:31:48] Because if you go against that hardened position, I can almost guarantee you it's not
[00:31:55] going to, they're not going to budge on it.
[00:31:57] And all you, what you're going to do to try and get them to budges, you're going to escalate
[00:32:02] yourself.
[00:32:03] Oh, you're not budging.
[00:32:04] They hit it harder.
[00:32:05] Oh, you're still not budging them, but they go even harder.
[00:32:07] You're still not budging them, you're going to go even harder.
[00:32:09] There are that whole time every time you're going harder, they're digging into defenses
[00:32:11] in deeper deeper deeper.
[00:32:14] And they're remembering how, how mean you are or whatever, especially if you're in a
[00:32:19] last-temperature situation.
[00:32:21] Oh, yeah.
[00:32:22] Now you're now you're taking serious detriment to your long-term war.
[00:32:25] Yeah.
[00:32:26] Because now you've given them ammunition.
[00:32:29] You've given them ammunition for future use.
[00:32:31] Bad move.
[00:32:32] It's a bad move.
[00:32:34] So again, what isn't, what, who's right and who's wrong is just not important.
[00:32:43] It's a lot to get through people's head.
[00:32:45] Who's right and who's wrong on some little tactical battle of today that really has no
[00:32:50] bearing on anything in the world.
[00:32:51] This is not something to be concerned about.
[00:32:55] So it might be your own ego that wants to be right.
[00:32:59] Have we thought about that factor?
[00:33:01] Have we thought about that?
[00:33:02] You as a man, as a husband, you want to be right to.
[00:33:08] So guess who the person that isn't budged?
[00:33:10] Guess who the person that does is and budging is.
[00:33:12] It's you.
[00:33:14] It's you.
[00:33:15] Now you might be quote unquote right, but it doesn't matter you're the person that won't
[00:33:20] budge.
[00:33:21] Now neither one of you will budge.
[00:33:22] Neither one of you will budge.
[00:33:24] We're not in a good situation.
[00:33:26] We're just in an escalating war of destruction.
[00:33:31] And we don't want that.
[00:33:32] Because we want to win the long-term strategic war.
[00:33:35] That's what we're looking at.
[00:33:37] Just the long-term strategic war.
[00:33:39] The little stuff in between, we did not concern about.
[00:33:42] Yeah.
[00:33:43] Yeah, fully.
[00:33:44] And the whole not budging thing too.
[00:33:47] Like that hurts.
[00:33:48] And I used to think about this early on in my relationship where I would get, we'd get in
[00:33:53] a little arguments or whatever, varying levels.
[00:33:58] And sometimes she would like, what, can you even come up with an example of something
[00:34:04] you'd argue about?
[00:34:05] Because as I was trying to think as I was sitting here as I was answering this question,
[00:34:08] I was trying to think of a good example.
[00:34:09] I can't even think of a good example.
[00:34:11] Yeah.
[00:34:12] Because they're all so stupid.
[00:34:13] Yeah.
[00:34:14] So yeah, a good example.
[00:34:15] No.
[00:34:16] Yeah.
[00:34:17] That's hard.
[00:34:18] Not really.
[00:34:21] But so she would be like, oh, I just don't want to talk about it anymore.
[00:34:26] But meanwhile, I'm still salty.
[00:34:28] Like, hey, we didn't resolve this.
[00:34:31] You know, there's certain code words.
[00:34:33] Like I thought, like a safe word.
[00:34:36] That girls that women, that guys have a two, but in particular, I've noticed it with
[00:34:39] some of my friends' wives.
[00:34:42] And one of my wives, she'll say, doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[00:34:46] What do you mean, buzzword?
[00:34:47] Like a code word.
[00:34:48] No, it's a safe word.
[00:34:49] It's a red flag.
[00:34:50] So it'll just be a, it'll be a giant red flag that she's, that she's angry.
[00:34:57] She doesn't, nothing I say is going to matter anymore.
[00:35:00] She's not going to change your mind.
[00:35:01] And she's just going to go forward.
[00:35:02] And she'll be like, oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:04] I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:35:05] We're, morning.
[00:35:07] Yeah.
[00:35:08] They gage his angry.
[00:35:10] That's what it means.
[00:35:11] So when I hear her say, doesn't matter, I just realize, okay, I'm, now I just
[00:35:15] hit a, a heavily defended position.
[00:35:18] And I'm going to stop attacking it.
[00:35:20] I'm going to flank.
[00:35:21] I'm going to talk about something else.
[00:35:23] I'm coming in from the side hatch.
[00:35:25] That's what I'm going to do.
[00:35:26] Yeah.
[00:35:27] Yeah, man, I wish I would have known that long time ago.
[00:35:31] I think that when, wait, what did you just say that your wife said to you, because you
[00:35:35] just said a code word?
[00:35:36] I mean, uh, up.
[00:35:38] I don't want to talk about it.
[00:35:39] I don't want to go.
[00:35:40] There's another one.
[00:35:41] Yeah.
[00:35:42] I want to talk about the sets that's a red flag.
[00:35:43] Well, in my mind, it was like, yeah, let's talk about it.
[00:35:45] I, I try it would try to do it in a conducive way, like, you know, like, a problem solving
[00:35:50] kind of way.
[00:35:51] But she just didn't feel the same way about the whole situation.
[00:35:54] You know, she handles it different.
[00:35:56] And, you know, ultimately, I still feel like if two people are willing to talk it out
[00:36:00] kind of without too much emotion, I think that's an effective way to do it.
[00:36:04] But nonetheless, what this would cause is, and this is going back to people not
[00:36:08] a budget.
[00:36:09] So what that would cause is all this time that would go on that we're not on good terms,
[00:36:14] you know, because I want to talk about, she doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:36:17] She just wants to, I don't know, go to bed, you know, meanwhile, I am with the philosophy
[00:36:20] of don't go to bed in an argument or whatever, you know.
[00:36:23] But meanwhile, we're at odds, even just a little bit.
[00:36:27] Even if we don't talk about it, she forgets about it.
[00:36:28] I'm still at odds.
[00:36:29] I'm not budging with my philosophy, you know.
[00:36:32] So at the end of the day, when you look back at all the minutes, all the hours, all
[00:36:37] the days that you've spent with each other, and now you have that, that, that some of
[00:36:46] of moments that you're at odds, you look at your relationship, you're like, man, this
[00:36:50] relationship isn't that good, because you spent that much time at odds with each other.
[00:36:55] Yeah, just because you didn't want to get in touch.
[00:36:57] Yes.
[00:36:58] So you got a bunch.
[00:37:00] You got a bunch.
[00:37:01] One of my buddies, I was hanging around having this wife and her little buzzword, where
[00:37:06] I was like, oh, I picked up on it pretty quickly.
[00:37:09] She would say, that's fine.
[00:37:10] It's a con.
[00:37:12] And I was like, hey, first, you know, first couple of times, I was like, oh, it's fine
[00:37:16] with her.
[00:37:17] And then I realized that there's nothing that's fine.
[00:37:19] I think that's kind of a common knowledge, what, what?
[00:37:23] What girls?
[00:37:24] You could just let that up.
[00:37:25] Like, no matter, that's fine.
[00:37:28] Whatever.
[00:37:29] Well, whatever is offensive, though.
[00:37:30] Oh, yeah.
[00:37:31] And they know if they say whatever, then that means that's fighting words.
[00:37:34] Because if you'll notice, that's fine.
[00:37:37] And it doesn't matter.
[00:37:39] They are all, they are all, like, sort of passive.
[00:37:45] Yeah.
[00:37:46] The way of saying, like, oh, let's just move on.
[00:37:48] Yeah.
[00:37:49] I don't want to talk about it.
[00:37:50] That one's a borderline.
[00:37:51] Yeah.
[00:37:52] Or it's like, or it's like one of the, I don't know.
[00:37:54] So what's good is when you detach from these situations, you start to pick up on
[00:37:59] these things that you're significant other.
[00:38:02] And also, there's, when you're in a relationship, you're in a team building, in
[00:38:05] a team environment, or you're in a business, you start to realize that guys or people
[00:38:09] you work with will have the same thing.
[00:38:11] Yeah.
[00:38:12] Well, let's say, you know what it's your call.
[00:38:14] Okay.
[00:38:15] I know it's my call, but I'm not trying to impose this plan on you.
[00:38:20] Let's figure it out.
[00:38:21] No, it's your call.
[00:38:22] We'll go ahead.
[00:38:23] Yeah.
[00:38:24] So that means you clearly don't agree with it.
[00:38:25] And of course, you can't say this to him, because they're already dug in on the fact
[00:38:27] that you're, you know, that you're wrong.
[00:38:29] Yeah.
[00:38:30] So those are little red flags.
[00:38:31] You got to look out for it in the world.
[00:38:33] Yeah.
[00:38:34] And that's back.
[00:38:35] And that's fun.
[00:38:37] And even that's a complex thing, because you know when someone says, fine, you know,
[00:38:43] what's wrong, what's wrong, nothing, right?
[00:38:45] Oh, you know, or you have reason to believe that it's not fine, especially the
[00:38:50] find or that's fine.
[00:38:53] You have good reason to believe that it's not fine.
[00:38:55] Right.
[00:38:56] So you're not fine.
[00:39:00] It's logical to think, hey, you shouldn't say you're fine when you're not fine.
[00:39:02] You actively chose to say you're fine when you're not fine, factually.
[00:39:07] So it's easy to come to that logical conclusion.
[00:39:09] Yeah.
[00:39:10] But there's your problem.
[00:39:11] Right.
[00:39:12] Logical.
[00:39:13] I'm just, you know, it's just, it's not that simple.
[00:39:15] It's not that black and white.
[00:39:16] So I'm saying this because I kind of, up until really recently, I thought that, hey,
[00:39:22] look, I'm not really wrong with this thing.
[00:39:24] I ask you a very specific question.
[00:39:27] If you're saying you're fine, it's like, it doesn't even matter what you say.
[00:39:32] I have to read like your mind or your body language and like everything, you know?
[00:39:37] And disregard your words.
[00:39:39] And only under these circumstances, not when you, when I say, hey, do you need, I don't
[00:39:45] know milk from the store, you say no, I know you mean, yeah, you know, it doesn't work
[00:39:49] like that.
[00:39:50] It's only under the circumstance.
[00:39:52] So it's like, and thinking, hey, man, that's kind of, that's not very good.
[00:39:55] That's a bad thing and habit to get in.
[00:39:58] So if you're not fine, you should say, you're not fine.
[00:40:00] That's my logic is what I'm saying.
[00:40:01] But here's the thing.
[00:40:02] When you're in a relationship with someone and it starts, I understand it starts at the
[00:40:05] beginning where you're trying to figure all this stuff out.
[00:40:07] That's what the beginning of the relationship for.
[00:40:09] But after a while, you start to know, okay, I know that tone.
[00:40:12] I know when you say fine, it's not fine.
[00:40:14] What the thing that's jacked up is when people don't realize that.
[00:40:18] That's a code word that means something else.
[00:40:22] Right.
[00:40:23] What you're signifying is you are coming up against a heavily defended area.
[00:40:27] I'm not changing my mind, but I'm not going to sit here and argue about it.
[00:40:31] So you know what, doesn't matter is what my wife would say.
[00:40:34] Yeah.
[00:40:35] Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:36] Pro men, win matters.
[00:40:38] When, when Sarah would say, I don't want to argue, I don't want to argue about this.
[00:40:43] It's, it's fine.
[00:40:44] Let's not talk about it.
[00:40:45] That would encourage me for further.
[00:40:47] But not like, I'm not a loose temper, kind of whatever, but it would frustrate you.
[00:40:51] It would make me, well, I'd be like, no, we have to go to, it's like, you know, if you
[00:40:54] have like, fucking, like a splinter, like you have a splinter in your hand or something,
[00:41:02] not talking about it is like, I just leave it.
[00:41:04] Let the skin grow over it and you'll be fine.
[00:41:07] And the thing is, you probably will be fine.
[00:41:08] But he's still got that splinter in there.
[00:41:10] Me, I'm like, okay, let's talk about this.
[00:41:12] Open it up and get the splinter out.
[00:41:16] But she's like, no, you know, I can't always recommend ripping that splinter out.
[00:41:21] Yeah, and sometimes the, again, you're going up against a hard defensive area.
[00:41:28] That's what we're talking about here.
[00:41:29] That's the question is, the question is, how do you, not lose your temper with your wife
[00:41:33] when you know she's wrong and she refused to punch you.
[00:41:35] No, you don't do it.
[00:41:37] You know how you maintain your temper.
[00:41:39] You realize that you're in a strategic situation where you're just going to win strategically.
[00:41:45] You're going to outsmart.
[00:41:47] You're going to outmaneuver.
[00:41:48] You're going to outmanipulate.
[00:41:50] I'm sorry.
[00:41:51] You're going to manipulate this situation.
[00:41:53] That's what you're going to do.
[00:41:55] And you're going to make her think, you know what, man, I was kind of a chair class night
[00:42:00] to my wonderful husband.
[00:42:02] Yeah.
[00:42:03] That's what we're going to have.
[00:42:05] Yeah, you got to do it in this genuine way.
[00:42:07] You know, of course you got to do it in real genuine and open and warm.
[00:42:12] And once I attack you when you're in that state, you know, so that's what you do to me my
[00:42:17] wife.
[00:42:18] No, I'm telling you, maybe if you switch all of a sudden and she's like, hey, this is
[00:42:24] the trick.
[00:42:25] But if you're like, if you put it on, you're just disarming them.
[00:42:29] Right.
[00:42:30] Yes, exactly.
[00:42:31] You disarming them.
[00:42:32] But man, it's hard to do when you lose your temper.
[00:42:33] I answered a question the other day, I was out in a van and I answered a question.
[00:42:36] I was like, listen, do not take marriage advice for me.
[00:42:40] Because the question, well, it's a long story, but the question was about, you know,
[00:42:47] how do you do your job when you have all this pressure and how do you maintain your family?
[00:42:52] And I kind of went through the story of like, hey, you know, my family came second.
[00:42:57] And that's really hard for people to understand.
[00:42:59] And I went through the whole thing.
[00:43:00] And that's what I've got to the end.
[00:43:01] And I said, listen, don't take marriage advice for me.
[00:43:05] And they've kind of laughed.
[00:43:06] But in a situation like this.
[00:43:10] I actually take marriage advice for me.
[00:43:12] Right.
[00:43:13] Yeah.
[00:43:14] Don't attack defended positions.
[00:43:15] I've said that 47 times right now.
[00:43:16] Yeah.
[00:43:17] And it's not to say that you've never attacked defended.
[00:43:20] I don't know if you ever have it with your life.
[00:43:23] But I'm just saying that sounds like good objective advice.
[00:43:27] Yeah.
[00:43:28] I don't, I probably haven't done that in so long.
[00:43:30] It's like, the tickling, we got to ask on the podcast.
[00:43:34] When was the, we got to ask this on the podcast?
[00:43:36] When is the last time that you were dug in on a position?
[00:43:39] How did you admit that you were wrong?
[00:43:41] And I was like, man, I haven't been dug in on a position in years.
[00:43:44] I don't even remember.
[00:43:45] Yeah.
[00:43:46] So it's the same thing here.
[00:43:47] One of why it's hack my wife in a defended position.
[00:43:50] Something that she's super crazy and passionate about.
[00:43:52] I'm not going near that thing.
[00:43:54] Yeah.
[00:43:55] Yeah.
[00:43:56] The losing your temper thing too.
[00:43:57] And I had learned, and I mentioned this before, where I learned about just getting
[00:44:01] mad in general from this book called Mind Games.
[00:44:04] You've seen teeny tiny little book.
[00:44:05] One chapter was not even one page.
[00:44:07] And you're first review on the podcast.
[00:44:10] You can be the reviewer.
[00:44:11] Mind games.
[00:44:12] Some of them were like puzzles, you know, to see how your mind works.
[00:44:16] Anyway, but what it did was indicate that was your playing coin fall.
[00:44:19] That was fun.
[00:44:20] Yeah.
[00:44:21] No, that's price is right.
[00:44:24] Anyway, what it indicated was that losing your temper or having anger issues, anger
[00:44:30] management issues, is what it was, it was a result of low self esteem.
[00:44:35] So exactly right.
[00:44:37] And that's how I always felt when you, you know, in elementary school and to me
[00:44:40] in school when you talk about self esteem or whatever, and slow self esteem, high self
[00:44:44] stuff.
[00:44:45] I'm being like man, that's so embarrassing to have low self esteem.
[00:44:47] It was like almost like a pride thing, you know, where I would even if I really felt
[00:44:52] like doing something or whatever, if it indicated, overtly that I had a low self esteem,
[00:44:57] if I didn't, I wouldn't do it.
[00:44:58] It was like really, like do you think that paranoia was caused by a low self esteem?
[00:45:02] In a way, probably because it's like the, you know, this feels switcheru.
[00:45:07] But so now I took that like times two where it said, look, everyone gets angry.
[00:45:14] It's a natural part of life, but if you have anger management issues, it is most likely
[00:45:19] from the low self esteem.
[00:45:20] So I took that as if I ever get angry, that's low self esteem.
[00:45:23] So man, now it'd be on my mind every single time.
[00:45:25] Where anytime I felt myself getting mad or being like, nope, I don't know low self esteem.
[00:45:29] So what that did though is train me and never to lose my temper.
[00:45:32] That's what I felt like.
[00:45:33] I felt like the back.
[00:45:34] I think that's the back, but but anyways, I think that's kind of the thing to check though.
[00:45:40] You know, where?
[00:45:41] Yeah, you're losing your temper all that's just like man, what's up with you?
[00:45:45] You're losing your temper.
[00:45:46] Don't lose your temper.
[00:45:47] That's for sure.
[00:45:49] Hey, you know, that splinter analogy, I gave you a man.
[00:45:53] Bro, I'm telling you, okay, so this one time, and it wasn't me who's Jake.
[00:45:56] He had a splinter, we're young.
[00:45:58] He had a splinter in his hand.
[00:45:59] We were like young, young, like, like five.
[00:46:03] I know this because we're living in the specific house that I remember.
[00:46:05] Anyway, he did tell us about that.
[00:46:07] Anyway, he had a splinter and it was deep.
[00:46:10] So my mom was like, hey, we got to get it out.
[00:46:12] We got to, you know, use a like a tweezers or something.
[00:46:15] He's like, no, no, no, no, he put up this full on what he called it, like a pardon defense.
[00:46:20] We're not getting that splinter out because he's crying, he's scared, you know, all this stuff.
[00:46:25] So my mom did was, all right, you know, let's don't take out the splinter.
[00:46:27] What he did was wait for him to go to sleep.
[00:46:30] You know, you just take out the splinter, it may or may not hurt for like a second, but it's out.
[00:46:34] Who cares?
[00:46:35] Wait, waited for him to go sleep, like a little nap.
[00:46:39] She goes in their gently, just sticks it out.
[00:46:41] Boom, problem solved.
[00:46:43] Splinter.
[00:46:44] Basically mama Charles.
[00:46:45] Flank them.
[00:46:45] She flanked him.
[00:46:46] Totally flanked them then.
[00:46:49] Good job, mom.
[00:46:51] Props to, props to mama Charles.
[00:46:54] Next best.
[00:46:55] Yes, please.
[00:46:56] Good Lord.
[00:46:57] How do you balance loyalty to your workmates and a personal sense of honor with self-interest
[00:47:05] when it comes to career progression?
[00:47:07] So this question has is giving the impression that that being loyal to your bros and
[00:47:16] being loyal to your workmates and having pride is the opposite of career progression, which
[00:47:26] is actually, I understand where that is coming from, but it's actually does not have to be true.
[00:47:32] It does not have to be the way you think.
[00:47:35] The way you get around this is number one, you work hard.
[00:47:38] That's what you do, you work hard.
[00:47:39] And you do a good job, not for promotion, not for self-interest, but to help the team
[00:47:49] accomplish the goal.
[00:47:50] That's what you should be working hard for.
[00:47:51] That's what you should be doing a good job for.
[00:47:55] And this is something I've said a bunch of times over the years.
[00:47:58] I don't know if I've ever said it on the podcast before, but I should tell my guys, because
[00:48:03] we'd be in some long term administrative, psychological warfare in our community, in the
[00:48:11] seal teams or in our organization.
[00:48:14] And I'd say, look, if we're doing the right thing for the right reason, we're going to
[00:48:18] win in the end.
[00:48:20] And I totally believe that to be true.
[00:48:22] Now for instance, I never really cared about break or being promoted.
[00:48:29] Now that being said, I actually did put in an officer package so that I could become an
[00:48:37] officer.
[00:48:38] Now why did I do that?
[00:48:39] I didn't do that out of greed or out of hunger for power.
[00:48:44] I did it because I had worked for a prior and listed officer and he made our lives really
[00:48:48] good because he was a really good leader.
[00:48:50] And I said, you know what?
[00:48:51] I'd like to make a bunch of the guys that I know, make 16 guys in a seal between make
[00:48:56] their lives better.
[00:48:57] Maybe I can do that.
[00:48:59] So that's sort of what led me to do it.
[00:49:01] I didn't do it out of out of self-interest and greed.
[00:49:06] I did it to help my bros.
[00:49:09] Now that then once I got promoted, once I became an officer, then I just busted my ass to
[00:49:16] do the best job I could.
[00:49:17] And again, I was never concerned with being promoted, but in order to do a good job,
[00:49:24] guess what I did?
[00:49:25] I built relationships.
[00:49:27] I took some hard jobs.
[00:49:28] I followed the rules.
[00:49:31] I supported the chain of command.
[00:49:32] I told the party line.
[00:49:34] Why did I do those things?
[00:49:35] Wasn't because I was trying to get promoted because I was trying to do a good job.
[00:49:38] And the more relationships I had and the more respect I had from the chain of command,
[00:49:44] the more power I had to help my guys.
[00:49:46] It wasn't about power for me.
[00:49:48] It was about power for the good of the platoon.
[00:49:50] So I could accomplish it.
[00:49:52] And I knew that I believed in the broad mission that we are doing.
[00:49:57] I knew that good order and discipline actually makes troops perform better.
[00:50:02] I knew that.
[00:50:04] And I knew that by following the rules, by supporting the chain of command, I knew that
[00:50:13] towing the part, I knew that those things would build trust in the chain of command.
[00:50:20] And I knew that building trust in the chain of command and being viewed positively from
[00:50:25] up the chain of command meant that I would get more support from the chain of command.
[00:50:31] Which once again, would make it easier for my guys to do their job.
[00:50:37] Because I could get a more gear.
[00:50:38] I could get them.
[00:50:39] And I said they needed, I could actually legitimately protest if something came down the
[00:50:45] pipe that I didn't agree with.
[00:50:48] If I didn't have trust and had build a relationship with my senior officers, how could
[00:50:54] I go back to my say, I don't think we should be doing this.
[00:50:56] They don't know me.
[00:50:57] They don't trust me.
[00:50:58] But when you build that trust, then you can have a more open and honest conversation.
[00:51:02] Which again is only done so that my platoon can have it easier life.
[00:51:08] So they could do their job better because I believed in the mission.
[00:51:14] So everything that I was doing that I was doing to make my platoon have a better go at things.
[00:51:23] Make my platoon more efficient.
[00:51:25] Make my platoon more effective on the battlefield.
[00:51:27] All those things that I was doing, I was doing to make that.
[00:51:32] And low and behold, when you're doing those things, when you're busting your ass, when
[00:51:36] you're trying to make life good for your platoon, so that platoon can more effectively and
[00:51:41] efficiently accomplish its mission on the battlefield, well, guess what?
[00:51:46] Those are aligned with a guy that's working hard in the supporting chain of command.
[00:51:51] So I would get rank number one.
[00:51:53] Why?
[00:51:54] Not because I was trying to get promoted and not for self interest.
[00:51:57] It's because I was trying to do a good job from my boys.
[00:52:03] So the bottom line is if you care about doing a good job and the doing things that will
[00:52:15] help you do a good job, again, not for promotion and not for recognition, but to truly
[00:52:20] do a good job, the end result is most likely going to be positive.
[00:52:28] Now the caveat to this is, does that mean that you'll be the first person to get promoted?
[00:52:33] No.
[00:52:35] Does it mean that you are guaranteed to get promoted?
[00:52:38] No.
[00:52:40] Some other guy that Brown knows and took all the credit he didn't deserve and stepped on
[00:52:44] of people is back to get to the top.
[00:52:48] He's probably going to get promoted ahead of you.
[00:52:50] He probably is.
[00:52:51] It's okay.
[00:52:53] It's okay.
[00:52:54] I will tell you that that will come back to Hauntim.
[00:52:57] Eventually, maybe not this year, maybe not next year, maybe in five years, people are
[00:53:02] going to see through that eventually.
[00:53:04] And you who's doing the right things for the right reasons, you will win in the end.
[00:53:15] Yeah, and talk about this a lot where if you're doing it just to get the promotion, but
[00:53:21] that's they're going to see that.
[00:53:23] They're going to smell it.
[00:53:24] Yeah.
[00:53:25] And not only is the boss going to smell it on you.
[00:53:28] I talked about that earlier tonight because if you were going to, if you've
[00:53:31] fallen, like if you've fallen tiered to be the admiral's aid, then that was a total red flag.
[00:53:38] Watch out for this guy.
[00:53:39] Yeah, I see what you do.
[00:53:40] Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.
[00:53:42] You want to be doing the right things for the right reasons.
[00:53:45] And that is how even in the long run you will get the recognition and the promotions
[00:53:52] and the credit that you deserve because why wouldn't you?
[00:53:55] You're a bus and you're asked to do a great job.
[00:53:57] You're going to get, you're going to shine eventually.
[00:53:59] Yeah, man, and if you're focused on doing the best job you can do, that's really the dynamics
[00:54:05] of promotions anyway.
[00:54:07] Yeah, it, it, or should be ideal.
[00:54:09] It should be ideal.
[00:54:10] And over time, it will be because there is somebody that Brown knows is the boss, that
[00:54:18] maneuvers to take these little missions or to do things to get the recognition that
[00:54:23] he's there's a guy that's doing that.
[00:54:26] And they can't get promoted.
[00:54:28] And you got to accept that and not succumb to it, not submit to it.
[00:54:33] Because you don't want to be that guy.
[00:54:34] And the long run, the guy that buss his ass that takes care of his troops that toes the
[00:54:38] party line that does the right things for the right reasons is going to win in the end.
[00:54:42] Yeah.
[00:54:43] You got to believe in that.
[00:54:44] Yeah, man, you know, guys do that in Jiu Jitsu, right sometimes.
[00:54:47] No, we talk about that too.
[00:54:48] Where they do.
[00:54:49] They have the wrong mindset.
[00:54:50] They just want that purple belt.
[00:54:51] So that brown belt.
[00:54:52] Whatever.
[00:54:53] Yeah, they want the next belt.
[00:54:54] Well, I want to tap that guy or I want to tap this guy.
[00:54:57] Yeah, those are the wrong reasons.
[00:54:58] Folks, yeah, and if you notice, the guys who are just in it to be the best that they
[00:55:05] can be, you see them asking questions or going over some stuff on their own kind of thing,
[00:55:10] where they do, they just want to learn as much as they can and get good as much as they
[00:55:13] can.
[00:55:14] And in the long run, those are going to be the guys that shine.
[00:55:18] Yeah.
[00:55:19] And then I think that's it's such a huge deal.
[00:55:24] And it goes for Jiu Jitsu or even at work or whatever.
[00:55:27] And if you're the guy who they can see what you're doing and you're kissing ass or
[00:55:33] like the guy, okay, this is one of the most embarrassing things you can do in my opinion,
[00:55:37] in Jiu Jitsu is after a promotion, you didn't get promoted and then you're overtly unhappy
[00:55:44] about it.
[00:55:45] And don't go one step further and say something about, I tapped that guy all the time.
[00:55:50] And he got his belt.
[00:55:52] Ooh, don't ever do it.
[00:55:53] Don't do it.
[00:55:54] Yeah, don't say it.
[00:55:55] Don't do it.
[00:55:56] Yeah.
[00:55:57] Don't think you can ever really live that down.
[00:56:00] Just unnecessary.
[00:56:01] It just shows, hey guys, look at me.
[00:56:04] I'm focused on the wrong thing.
[00:56:06] I'm focused on like wearing a belt rather than my skill.
[00:56:10] You know, I'd rather get a belt and maybe not have the skill.
[00:56:14] I'd rather that than have the skill and maybe not have the belt right now.
[00:56:19] That's what you're saying.
[00:56:20] Oh, yeah.
[00:56:21] Yeah.
[00:56:22] Yeah.
[00:56:23] If you don't have the belt right now, you get the belt.
[00:56:30] You know, that's just part of the, you know what, it could be a long time.
[00:56:37] Yeah.
[00:56:38] And you know what, that's okay.
[00:56:40] Oh, unless you're quiet, they need one.
[00:56:42] Oh, yeah.
[00:56:43] But you won't have the belt.
[00:56:44] But that's the one.
[00:56:45] You've got to also accept the fact that some guys can get promoted at you.
[00:56:48] Good.
[00:56:49] Good thing you good you tapped on before.
[00:56:51] Good.
[00:56:52] That's perfect.
[00:56:53] Keep that up.
[00:56:54] Yeah.
[00:56:55] We're going to get you that belt.
[00:56:56] Yeah, stop whining.
[00:56:57] I heard of a guy who left the gym.
[00:57:00] Yeah.
[00:57:01] Argym.
[00:57:02] Because he didn't get a belt.
[00:57:03] And he was like, oh, I'm just going to go somewhere else.
[00:57:05] Yeah.
[00:57:06] That's too bad.
[00:57:07] Yeah.
[00:57:08] I just heard he was a story.
[00:57:09] I wasn't there enough.
[00:57:11] Anyway.
[00:57:12] Next question.
[00:57:14] Unless we have more on that one.
[00:57:15] No.
[00:57:16] We're good.
[00:57:17] Dead horse has been beaten.
[00:57:19] Yeah.
[00:57:20] Don't be that guy, man.
[00:57:21] Yeah.
[00:57:22] Chaco on team building.
[00:57:25] When leading a team, do you feel that there's any benefit to team building exercises or retreats?
[00:57:34] Well, this is a interesting question that actually I feel unfairly qualified to answer
[00:57:42] because we, we lay for an eye.
[00:57:44] We have a little business called echelon front where that's, we work with a lot of different companies on a different
[00:57:50] side range of different categories.
[00:57:53] Sometimes we go in and work with a business.
[00:57:55] Sometimes we're going to do a keynote speech for a business.
[00:57:58] Like they'll be having a big meeting and we're going to do one keynote speech for an hour
[00:58:04] and we leave and we're done.
[00:58:06] But most of the time we're doing more long range stuff or we spend time with the company
[00:58:11] we go in.
[00:58:12] But oftentimes we do do some kind of situation where their company has decided to do some
[00:58:19] kind of a leadership off-site or a team building exercise or a leadership retreat.
[00:58:25] And we mostly get involved with the leadership although that does sometimes trickle down
[00:58:31] to where we'll do some work with all the front line troops.
[00:58:36] So we constantly see these, these leadership off-sites and we speak and or lead them.
[00:58:43] Sometimes we run the whole thing and there are definitely some outstanding events.
[00:58:48] And we've participated in and led some outstanding events with companies.
[00:58:54] And I think one of the most important things about these off-sites is it forces the leadership
[00:59:00] team to detach from the day to day firefights of what the business is.
[00:59:04] No matter what, there's no businesses where the CEO and the C-suite are like sitting around
[00:59:08] not doing anything.
[00:59:10] Those companies don't exist, at least that I've seen.
[00:59:14] You're trying to expand.
[00:59:15] You're trying to grow.
[00:59:16] You've got competitors making moves.
[00:59:18] So you're in the fight and then you've got operational things that are happening.
[00:59:22] So you're in the fight.
[00:59:23] So when you do these leadership off-sites, it's good that you get them to focus on some
[00:59:27] other development and some whatever issues they're having and areas where they can improve.
[00:59:32] So it gives them the opportunity to focus on those things.
[00:59:36] And also gives them the opportunity to self-assess as a team, how they're doing and themselves
[00:59:45] as leaders, how they're doing.
[00:59:49] And when I talk to people about leadership and teamwork and the shortfalls and the pitfalls
[00:59:55] that exist and then when they hear me talk about it, they recognize their own weaknesses.
[01:00:00] Every time I get done they go, man, when you were talking about, you know, when you were
[01:00:05] talking about ego, sometimes I think I let my ego get in the way or the way when you were
[01:00:09] talking about cover movement, I don't think I, when you're talking about ownership,
[01:00:13] they see areas of their own weaknesses and they see where they can improve.
[01:00:20] And then when you get the whole team that's all learning that same information, they're
[01:00:24] all doing that same self-assessment.
[01:00:27] And then the whole leadership team gets aligned behind the same leadership principles of
[01:00:35] ownership and humility and cover movement.
[01:00:38] Simple decentralized command and all those things that I talk about, that is extremely
[01:00:42] powerful.
[01:00:43] It is extremely powerful.
[01:00:46] And we see really drastic turnaround with the companies that we work with and it's awesome.
[01:00:53] It's awesome to see.
[01:00:55] And then one thing that we do when we work more in depth with the company, we do our
[01:01:00] own leadership offsights where we do simulated combat.
[01:01:05] And I know it sounds, it sounds, if I wouldn't have done it so many times, I would be
[01:01:10] surprised that it's possible.
[01:01:12] But we take either paint guns, paint ball guns or airsoft guns and we teach them the basic
[01:01:19] shooting principles and we teach them some basic small unit tactics.
[01:01:23] And then we go and perform missions.
[01:01:24] We have them perform missions.
[01:01:26] And every time they got eight guys, they got 10 guys, they got 12 guys, girls, whatever
[01:01:30] in their group and they go in a salt attack.
[01:01:34] They come up with a plan.
[01:01:36] They go out.
[01:01:37] We put one person in charge.
[01:01:39] That person has to lead a mission.
[01:01:41] And they what they theorized in the classroom, they now get to put to the test and they
[01:01:49] learn those lessons very, very clearly.
[01:01:52] You know, we'd see a guy that would be a really strong leader.
[01:01:57] And he was, okay, I'm in charge this run.
[01:02:00] Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:02:01] Here's the way the plan is.
[01:02:02] Put down.
[01:02:03] You're going to do this.
[01:02:04] You're going to do this.
[01:02:05] You see that micro management start.
[01:02:06] And then as soon as they start the operation, everyone is expecting to get micro managed.
[01:02:11] So no one's thinking on their own.
[01:02:13] So now you get to decentralize a lack of decentralized command.
[01:02:16] And everything goes sideways and nobody does anything.
[01:02:18] Because I'll be waiting to be told what to do.
[01:02:21] So that's an example of the kind of things that people learn.
[01:02:26] So with all that, yes, absolutely.
[01:02:30] We, you know, I've been to and we run some pretty awesome team building exercises and
[01:02:35] retreats and leadership off sites that are better great.
[01:02:39] And we've seen awesome results from a wall.
[01:02:43] I've also sat through some off sites that are not that effective.
[01:02:50] You know, you get situations where people don't open up or there's no exchange.
[01:02:53] Or you get these team building exercises that some people set up.
[01:02:57] And there's some kind of physical or mental challenge.
[01:03:02] And while they might be hard and they might take some teamwork to perform, they don't break
[01:03:09] the paradigm that the company is in.
[01:03:12] So then when the bleeding through that challenge, or whatever it is, whether it's a,
[01:03:16] some kind of a p-teats, some kind of physical training, or some kind of a boat race, or
[01:03:20] something like that, they'll lead through that challenge the way they always lead the way
[01:03:24] they currently lead.
[01:03:25] So nothing has learned and nothing has gained and no leadership advancement has been made.
[01:03:29] And all they've done is actually, all they've actually done is reinforce the bad leadership
[01:03:35] situation that they already have.
[01:03:38] So that's one of the things that I've seen that can be problematic.
[01:03:44] And that's why we've gone to the direction that we go.
[01:03:47] Where we really focus on, let's look at leadership and the team working together, how what
[01:03:55] the leadership dynamics are, what are weaknesses are, what we see, where we uncover the
[01:03:59] friction, where we see the team not working well together, where we see the leaders not
[01:04:03] stepping up and leading, where we see the leaders' ego is getting away.
[01:04:07] I mean, there's so many things that we uncover and find.
[01:04:10] It's phenomenal and it really does make it fun for us.
[01:04:14] Because every time you see a new leadership team, it's like diagnosing a patient.
[01:04:23] And you look at the problems that they're having, they say, oh, well, you know what?
[01:04:25] Try this over here.
[01:04:27] Like this off a little bit, and the next thing, you've got that patient up and running
[01:04:31] and they're winning.
[01:04:32] We're like a mechanic.
[01:04:34] We grab the car right?
[01:04:35] Yeah.
[01:04:36] Thoughts.
[01:04:37] Yeah, some of those leadership are not leadership necessarily, but these team building
[01:04:41] retreats to sometimes it seems like whoever organized them really wasn't focusing on
[01:04:46] results.
[01:04:47] They were just focusing on our annual retreat.
[01:04:51] So they make it in the Bahamas and all these activities are kind of fun.
[01:04:57] And everyone's an all-infinite, a administrative thing or something.
[01:05:00] Yeah, and fun can be part of it.
[01:05:01] There's bonding that happens.
[01:05:03] There's getting to know each other and that's always positive.
[01:05:07] But if you're, I'm all about having fun.
[01:05:10] I'm all about bonding, but I'm even more about learning.
[01:05:13] I'm even more about improving the people we work with, the guys and girls that we work with.
[01:05:22] I want them to be better of leaders.
[01:05:24] Right.
[01:05:25] That's what I want.
[01:05:26] Yeah, that's what I want.
[01:05:27] So yeah, sure, do I want them to get some team challenges?
[01:05:32] Yes, but like I said, I don't want that just reinforce the paradigm of the third
[01:05:36] already and the leadership paradigm of the third already in.
[01:05:39] I want them to improve.
[01:05:41] So let's actually break down and look and analyze and diagnose what the issues are.
[01:05:50] And then let's solve.
[01:05:51] And you know, it's not always, it's not always that these teams go in and they're, you
[01:05:57] know, we don't get hired by companies that are failing.
[01:06:00] In fact, most of the time, we get hired by companies that are doing well, that want to do
[01:06:04] better.
[01:06:05] So when I say we diagnose what the problem is, it's not a problem where it's causing the
[01:06:13] company to failure, but it's a friction point where it is holding the company back from
[01:06:18] really reaching the best, the next level and going from being a really good company or
[01:06:24] even an outstanding company to the best in class company.
[01:06:28] Gotcha.
[01:06:29] So it's like a multi-vitamin, not a pink killer.
[01:06:33] Yes.
[01:06:34] You know, that's not my another.
[01:06:36] I read that somewhere.
[01:06:38] You know, the micromanaging thing.
[01:06:40] Yes.
[01:06:41] And that's, it's funny because you're the first person that I've heard say that this, where
[01:06:46] you said, those start micromanaging.
[01:06:48] And then all of a sudden, the people getting micromanaged, expect to get micromanaged, so
[01:06:53] they stop thinking, right?
[01:06:54] 100%.
[01:06:55] So yeah, that happens all the way.
[01:06:56] And it goes the other way, too.
[01:06:58] If you come to me and you say, hey, Jockel, how do you want me to do this?
[01:07:01] And I go, figure it out.
[01:07:03] And you say, hey, boss, can you show me how to do this?
[01:07:04] I say, figure it out.
[01:07:06] When we get in the field, you're going to know that I expect you to figure it out.
[01:07:11] Right.
[01:07:12] Yeah, man.
[01:07:13] Like when I, when I drive with my life, she'll start micromanaging like how I drive.
[01:07:18] Like get in this lane or, you know, just, you're going to slow or too fast, whatever,
[01:07:25] too slow typically.
[01:07:26] Yeah, it's cold.
[01:07:27] But here's the thing.
[01:07:28] I'm not going to lose my temper.
[01:07:30] You know, I don't think, yeah, front seat in her case, but yeah, man, for sure.
[01:07:34] And I'm not going to lose my temper, I'll be like, okay, but that's what I do.
[01:07:37] I shut down my brain.
[01:07:39] And then so one time Jada was riding with us and he was, uh, now he was actually
[01:07:44] I was micromanaging Jade.
[01:07:46] And he put it in these good terms, which I thought were good.
[01:07:48] He said either be the navigator, 100% because he stopped thinking, you know, or don't
[01:07:54] be it at all.
[01:07:55] You can't just start chiming in when you think I'm going to slow.
[01:07:58] You know, otherwise, yeah, I don't want to, I'm, if Sarah's yelling at me, hey, you're
[01:08:03] going too slow, I'm going to be like, okay, how fast you want me to go?
[01:08:06] I'll go that fast.
[01:08:07] So if you're navigating on the map, you're going to have to tell me every turn to make.
[01:08:12] Don't say, hey, you're going to make this right.
[01:08:13] And then I make the right thing.
[01:08:14] Just sign off, you know, because you're anticipating the micromanage.
[01:08:18] Exactly right, man.
[01:08:19] And I think it kind of goes automatically, you know, you got to put in a lot of
[01:08:23] methods for where you knew that Sarah never said anything.
[01:08:26] You and you got in the car.
[01:08:27] All me, you know that you had to have the route prepped before you got in the vehicle.
[01:08:30] Well, we might go a little bit too slow, but still, man, what it's all me is first thinking
[01:08:34] goes, yeah, man, don't micromanage.
[01:08:38] Or when you micromanage don't expect them to just all of a sudden start making creative
[01:08:44] decisions.
[01:08:45] It's just hard, it's hard for it to work that way, man.
[01:08:50] All right, next question.
[01:08:52] This is the last one.
[01:08:54] Joko, could you tell us any possible regrets or things you'd done differently?
[01:09:06] Something you'd wished you'd learned sooner?
[01:09:13] That's things I could have done differently, things I wish I learned sooner.
[01:09:23] Of course, there are things I wish I learned sooner.
[01:09:27] There's so much knowledge out there, so much information, so many ways to get better.
[01:09:38] So we make, we make so many mistakes.
[01:09:45] We're the product of our mistakes.
[01:09:48] And oftentimes, the lesson is sitting there right in front of our face.
[01:09:55] It's there to be learned, but we miss it and we don't pay attention to it or we think
[01:09:59] we know better until it punches us in the face.
[01:10:11] And the most important thing to learn is that we have so much to learn.
[01:10:17] We all do.
[01:10:19] And we can learn from school and from people and from experience and we learn from life.
[01:10:30] But you have to process the information.
[01:10:34] You have to absorb it.
[01:10:35] You have to accept it.
[01:10:37] You have to open your mind.
[01:10:40] You've got to free your mind so that you can learn and make real progress.
[01:10:49] And as far as regrets and things I wish I would have done differently, of course.
[01:11:02] Hindsight is 2020 and looking back, of course, who wouldn't want to take another go
[01:11:09] with something and improve on the first try by doing it again.
[01:11:15] And why not do it again and again and again and why not just do it over and over again until
[01:11:22] you have it perfect.
[01:11:28] But the fact is you don't get that chance.
[01:11:35] You get one shot.
[01:11:38] One shot at this gig right here.
[01:11:42] One life.
[01:11:45] That's all you've got.
[01:11:48] And regret.
[01:11:50] And in of itself, it's worthless.
[01:11:56] It does nothing for you.
[01:11:58] In fact, the only valuable thing in regret is the lesson you learned.
[01:12:05] The knowledge that you gained.
[01:12:10] But walking around filled with regret.
[01:12:14] Get you nothing.
[01:12:18] So learn and move on.
[01:12:22] Don't let regret.
[01:12:24] Be chewed down.
[01:12:25] Don't be a slave to regret.
[01:12:27] No.
[01:12:29] Let it teach you.
[01:12:31] Let it make you better.
[01:12:36] Let the fear of regret fuel you to take action today.
[01:12:42] Now to take action now to become a better person.
[01:12:52] Not filled with regret.
[01:12:57] But filled with knowledge.
[01:13:03] And strength and power and filled with life.
[01:13:18] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:13:25] No regrets.
[01:13:28] Not only knowledge.
[01:13:38] And that's what we are striving for on this podcast to gain knowledge.

[01:15:12] Do you get a lot of duct tape from Amazon?
[01:15:14] No, I've gotten, yeah.
[01:15:17] You always say if you need duct tape man go to Amazon.
[01:15:20] Well I said it once and it kind of stuck duct tape.
[01:15:23] It.
[01:15:24] Anyway, I saw you watch when Guy wrote, actually I still watch when Guy wrote all the
[01:15:28] time.
[01:15:29] That was his thing, that duct tape.
[01:15:30] Yeah.
[01:15:31] Don't go anywhere without it.
[01:15:32] In the military we call it rigor tape.
[01:15:35] Yeah.
[01:15:36] And some people call it 120 mile an hour tape but I never called it that one time.
[01:15:40] But we call it rigor tape.
[01:15:42] Yeah.
[01:15:43] Yeah.
[01:15:44] I got some black rigor tape.
[01:15:47] On the last, if you're getting some or anything on Amazon.com just try if you can just
[01:15:52] remember to go to jockelpodcast.com first.
[01:15:54] Click on the Amazon link in booms, automatic supporting podcast and we thank you for that.
[01:15:59] I think for that jockel thing to do.
[01:16:02] And while you're at jockel store if you like any of the shirts, go ahead grab one or
[01:16:09] a coffee mug or a sticker.
[01:16:11] That's a good way to support.
[01:16:12] This shirt that you're wearing tonight is a little bit new isn't it?
[01:16:16] It's a little new.
[01:16:17] Yes, the newest one.
[01:16:18] It's all looks very dare.
[01:16:19] If you're watching on YouTube.
[01:16:22] If you're not watching on YouTube, the front of the shirt, it's a black on black shirt.
[01:16:27] Yeah.
[01:16:28] And then the black on the front it says, know the darkness.
[01:16:32] You know, actually ironically if you're watching on YouTube, you might not even be able
[01:16:35] to see know the darkness.
[01:16:38] And let's say and I mentioned this before this when we made this one, there's that added
[01:16:42] layer where it's dark.
[01:16:44] The shirt is for you.
[01:16:45] It's not to show everyone.
[01:16:47] Oh, look at me.
[01:16:48] Look at my cool shirt.
[01:16:49] The shirt is for you.
[01:16:50] You know it's there.
[01:16:51] And on the back it's got some madness.
[01:16:52] Some darkness.
[01:16:53] Some dark.
[01:16:54] It's dark.
[01:16:55] Yeah.
[01:16:56] So that's what you do the shirts, right?
[01:17:00] I mean, so this must, what did that?
[01:17:02] Well, like, we've talked about a lot of stuff.
[01:17:05] Why did you, why did you go with the darkness?
[01:17:07] Why did you, why was that important to you?
[01:17:09] Because that was the main theme.
[01:17:11] Remember like when you, when you started it or what?
[01:17:14] Yeah.
[01:17:15] Well, okay.
[01:17:16] When Jockel started the main theme and still is the main theme where it goes into all
[01:17:20] these dark books and concepts.
[01:17:25] And then every time, even Tim Kennedy, when we asked him, oh, or one of the questions was like,
[01:17:30] hey, how do you, you know, reconcile, you know, being happier, anything that when you
[01:17:34] see so much darkness.
[01:17:36] And it actually intensifies your happiness because you can recognize the good stuff.
[01:17:42] So, know the darkness so you can see the light.
[01:17:46] That's kind of the phrase there, right?
[01:17:48] So you can appreciate good things way more when you know bad things.
[01:17:51] And that goes for everything, really.
[01:17:53] So you didn't make a sure that said, be happy.
[01:17:59] The light is with us because you could have made that, I guess.
[01:18:02] Yeah.
[01:18:03] Kind of inconsistent though with the whole feel.
[01:18:06] I mean.
[01:18:08] And the bottom line is if you're surrounded by all the happiness, it starts to fade.
[01:18:12] Right?
[01:18:13] Yeah.
[01:18:14] Yeah.
[01:18:15] Exactly.
[01:18:16] So, will us not make a happy shirt?
[01:18:17] Let's make a dark shirt.
[01:18:18] Yeah.
[01:18:19] Maybe we'll make a happy shirt in the future.
[01:18:21] But I'm saying, for right now, that's where you were feeling.
[01:18:24] That's what it's feeling.
[01:18:25] Yeah.
[01:18:26] I thought it was appropriate.
[01:18:27] I think it came out good, man.
[01:18:29] I dig it.
[01:18:30] There you go.
[01:18:32] Or if you like any of the other ones, just plenty of cool freedom.
[01:18:35] That was a cool one too.
[01:18:36] I think.
[01:18:37] Yeah.
[01:18:37] I don't know what you're at on it.
[01:18:39] Anyway, that you can see on whatever.
[01:18:41] I still haven't seen a live in the wild.
[01:18:46] I haven't seen travel all the time.
[01:18:49] I haven't seen it a trooper yet.
[01:18:51] Just represent.
[01:18:52] Yeah.
[01:18:53] I mean, so, so forward to it.
[01:18:55] Yeah.
[01:18:56] I've never, I've never, I've taken a selfie.
[01:19:00] But I think I might do a selfie.
[01:19:01] If I see a person in the wild trooper out there, just represent in hardcore and
[01:19:07] an airport somewhere, coming straight up, we're gonna do some burpees and then see.
[01:19:11] You know what, yeah, but I've seen them here.
[01:19:16] Yeah, and San Diego.
[01:19:17] But those are our people.
[01:19:18] We know everybody.
[01:19:19] Yeah, but I've seen one where I didn't know.
[01:19:22] I didn't know that, you know, that, like, this guy, that person.
[01:19:27] I knew him.
[01:19:28] I know him.
[01:19:29] But I didn't know he got a shirt and stuff.
[01:19:31] I want to be an Indianapolis, or I want to be in Philadelphia.
[01:19:36] I'd be walking down the street and see some guys as a represent in hardcore.
[01:19:40] Right there in the street.
[01:19:42] That'll be awesome.
[01:19:43] Well, I can attest that with the online stuff I've seen, the people representing, they
[01:19:47] are representing hardcore.
[01:19:49] Yeah.
[01:19:50] Anything else?
[01:19:51] No, that's it.
[01:19:53] If you like it, just grab one if you want.
[01:19:55] Right on.
[01:19:56] Well, as always, if you want to continue this conversation with us, all these questions we
[01:20:04] answered tonight, never from you guys, they're from the troopers.
[01:20:08] They're from you also.
[01:20:09] Thank you for doing that.
[01:20:11] We are on the interwebs on Twitter.
[01:20:15] Echo Charles is at Echo Charles.
