00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.44 This is Jockel Podcast number 183.
00:00:03.44 --> 00:00:06.04 Burek O'Charles and me, Jockel Winning.
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:07.04 Good evening, Eko.
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.04 Good evening.
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:14.12 Not one of the guys on the ground at like this mission.
00:00:14.12 --> 00:00:20.96 Now, moving to within a click of their target, they had pushed that distraction from their minds.
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:25.76 And we're solely focused on the deadly challenge before them.
00:00:25.76 --> 00:00:30.72 Dancing at the GPS attached to the stock of his rifle and scanning the terrain ahead,
00:00:30.72 --> 00:00:34.88 Lieutenant Commander James Rees called a quick perimeter.
00:00:34.88 --> 00:00:40.000 Snipers were already moving up to the high ground as team leaders joined Rees for a last
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.28 quick update before the final push to the objective.
00:00:45.28 --> 00:00:51.80 Even with all the technology at their disposal, things could go wrong in a heartbeat.
00:00:51.80 --> 00:00:56.04 Their enemy was cunning and highly adaptive.
00:00:56.04 --> 00:01:03.40 After 16 years at war, the Afghan saying the Americans all have the watches, but we have
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:05.88 all the time.
00:01:05.88 --> 00:01:10.12 Rang a bit more true than head in the early days.
00:01:10.12 --> 00:01:14.20 What do you think Rees asked a huge beast of a man looking like a creature from another
00:01:14.20 --> 00:01:20.76 world with his A-O-R-1 patterned camouflage body armor and
00:01:20.76 --> 00:01:26.04 ops core half-shell helmet with nods firmly in place?
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:31.96 Rees looked at his most seasoned troop chief, the light-green glow of the nods illuminated
00:01:31.96 --> 00:01:38.68 through the beard on the man's face, a slight smile that could not be mistaken for anything
00:01:38.68 --> 00:01:45.80 other than the confident look of a professional special operations soldier.
00:01:45.80 --> 00:01:53.08 Just over the rise, Rees replied, predator shows nothing moving, no centuries, nothing.
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:55.56 His troop chief nodded.
00:01:55.56 --> 00:02:01.52 All right guys, he said to the other four men in the circle, let's do it.
00:02:01.52 --> 00:02:06.92 They rose with resolve and moved with the poise of men who are comfortable in chaos,
00:02:06.92 --> 00:02:11.64 moving up the rocky ridge line to get their teams in place before approaching the target
00:02:11.64 --> 00:02:14.16 to make entry.
00:02:14.16 --> 00:02:15.92 Rees is too easy.
00:02:15.92 --> 00:02:17.80 You're thinking too much again.
00:02:17.80 --> 00:02:19.64 It's just another mission.
00:02:19.64 --> 00:02:23.20 Then why this feeling?
00:02:23.20 --> 00:02:25.60 Maybe it's just the headaches.
00:02:25.60 --> 00:02:29.80 The headaches had plagued Rees for the past several months, finally prompting a visit to
00:02:29.80 --> 00:02:36.20 Balboa Naval Medical Center before this deployment for a series of tests.
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:38.16 Still no word back from the docks.
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:40.52 Maybe it's nothing.
00:02:40.52 --> 00:02:43.60 But maybe it's something.
00:02:43.60 --> 00:02:49.40 It's just a long time ago that if something didn't look right, then it probably wasn't.
00:02:49.40 --> 00:02:55.20 That judgment had kept him and his man alive on many of deployment.
00:02:55.20 --> 00:02:59.04 Everything had lined up a little too easy for this target.
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:05.84 The intel, the offset, infill, the current state of the objective area, and why the
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:08.92 pressure from higher authority to go after this target.
00:03:08.92 --> 00:03:16.96 When was the last time a flag level command injected itself into a tactical planning process?
00:03:16.96 --> 00:03:20.12 Something wasn't added up.
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:22.84 Maybe everything's fine.
00:03:22.84 --> 00:03:28.08 Maybe it's that, maybe it's a bit of paranoia.
00:03:28.08 --> 00:03:31.88 Maybe I'm getting too old for this.
00:03:31.88 --> 00:03:32.88 Focus.
00:03:32.88 --> 00:03:34.88 Rees.
00:03:34.88 --> 00:03:39.44 It wasn't the first time that they had approached a target they suspected was a possible
00:03:39.44 --> 00:03:40.44 ambush.
00:03:40.44 --> 00:03:47.04 At one point in the war, when intel had pointed to the high possibility of an ambush corroborated
00:03:47.04 --> 00:03:51.60 by multiple sources, both human and technical, Rees would have knocked on the door with
00:03:51.60 --> 00:03:59.04 a thermobaric AT4 or a few 105 rounds from an AC 130 gunship.
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:04.80 This was the first time that actual tactics had been dictated from higher.
00:04:04.80 --> 00:04:14.20 A man who would not be on the ground, focus on the mission Rees.
00:04:14.20 --> 00:04:16.92 One more check with the tactical operations center.
00:04:16.92 --> 00:04:24.24 A forward-based command also called the talk and to look at the predator feed.
00:04:24.24 --> 00:04:26.52 Nothing.
00:04:26.52 --> 00:04:29.16 Another check with the sniper teams.
00:04:29.16 --> 00:04:32.28 Nothing moving.
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:37.04 That glanced up at the military crest of the hill in front of him.
00:04:37.04 --> 00:04:42.80 Through his nods, he could see the assault teams set and ready to move.
00:04:42.80 --> 00:04:50.44 He couldn't see the snipers, which gave him cause for a thoughtful smile.
00:04:50.44 --> 00:04:54.16 Best in the business.
00:04:54.16 --> 00:05:02.52 Rees keyed his radio and opened his mouth to give the order to move.
00:05:02.52 --> 00:05:05.76 Then it all went black.
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:10.28 The explosion knocked Rees back ten yards and ripped his helmet from his head as the entire
00:05:10.28 --> 00:05:12.72 military crest of the hill in front of him.
00:05:12.72 --> 00:05:19.16 He erupted in a concussion of violence and death.
00:05:19.16 --> 00:05:27.20 He meets friends, husbands and fathers who one moment earlier had represented the best
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:50.52 spots in special operations force in the world were gone in less than a second.
00:05:50.52 --> 00:05:59.08 Somewhere a true believer is training to kill you.
00:05:59.08 --> 00:06:06.84 He is training with minimum food or water in austere conditions day and night.
00:06:06.84 --> 00:06:13.64 The only thing clean on him is his weapon and he made his web gear.
00:06:13.64 --> 00:06:22.12 He doesn't worry about what work out to do, his rock weighs, what it weighs, his runs
00:06:22.12 --> 00:06:27.88 and when the enemy stops chasing him.
00:06:27.88 --> 00:06:32.44 The true believer doesn't care how hard it is.
00:06:32.44 --> 00:06:47.96 He only knows that he wins or he dies.
00:06:47.96 --> 00:06:57.16 He doesn't go home at 1700.
00:06:57.16 --> 00:07:05.64 Those are two excerpts from two books.
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:10.40 The second book is called True Believer.
00:07:10.40 --> 00:07:14.84 These books are fiction.
00:07:14.84 --> 00:07:23.72 They are novels and with the exception of the novel Musashi by Eli Yoshikawa.
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:27.84 I have not covered any novels on the podcast.
00:07:27.84 --> 00:07:31.76 But I'm actually not here to talk about those novels.
00:07:31.76 --> 00:07:36.68 The novels, these books were written by Asio.
00:07:36.68 --> 00:07:45.40 Asio that I knew and Asio that is here with us tonight to share his experiences in the
00:07:45.40 --> 00:07:55.40 teams.
00:07:55.40 --> 00:08:00.76 A father and a writer of fiction.
00:08:00.76 --> 00:08:04.52 His name is Jack Carr.
00:08:04.52 --> 00:08:05.52 Welcome to the show.
00:08:05.52 --> 00:08:07.16 Thank you so much for having me.
00:08:07.16 --> 00:08:09.16 It's great to be here.
00:08:09.16 --> 00:08:11.60 Good to finally get you out here.
00:08:11.60 --> 00:08:13.92 I know we tried to hook this up for a little while.
00:08:13.92 --> 00:08:18.24 It's good and you sent me your latest book and I said to myself, okay, well let's just
00:08:18.24 --> 00:08:20.24 make this happen.
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:21.24 So, yeah, man.
00:08:21.24 --> 00:08:22.84 Let's talk a little bit about you.
00:08:22.84 --> 00:08:28.36 Well, that's already what I've never heard that True Believer read quite so well.
00:08:28.36 --> 00:08:33.88 So I used to read that to my guys in the teams and then read your laws of combat.
00:08:33.88 --> 00:08:35.88 Read those to them.
00:08:35.88 --> 00:08:39.96 And that one would just set the stage with the series.
00:08:39.96 --> 00:08:41.80 Who are going after here?
00:08:41.80 --> 00:08:47.32 And your laws of combat, which of course I pass on to everybody I've ever worked with ever
00:08:47.32 --> 00:08:48.32 sense.
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:49.32 Right.
00:08:49.32 --> 00:08:52.60 I probably found a couple of them in the book for those that were there's a couple.
00:08:52.60 --> 00:08:56.48 I put them in italics to give you credit.
00:08:56.48 --> 00:08:57.48 Jack.
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:01.76 So let's talk a little bit about where it all started.
00:09:01.76 --> 00:09:03.68 Like what year were you born?
00:09:03.68 --> 00:09:04.68 Yeah, 73.
00:09:04.68 --> 00:09:07.92 So you're kind of a young and I'm like, well, what do you want?
00:09:07.92 --> 00:09:08.92 You're a one year old.
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:09.92 71.
00:09:09.92 --> 00:09:10.92 Okay.
00:09:10.92 --> 00:09:15.68 And in childhood, the 80s though, you know, as this form of years were like 80 to 89.
00:09:15.68 --> 00:09:16.88 And you grew up in North Cal.
00:09:16.88 --> 00:09:17.88 North Cal.
00:09:17.88 --> 00:09:20.16 And my mom was librarian from a very early age.
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:22.56 Were you born in area or city area?
00:09:22.56 --> 00:09:23.56 Yeah.
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:24.56 Yeah.
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:25.56 I'm not too rural.
00:09:25.56 --> 00:09:26.56 Small town, I'd say.
00:09:26.56 --> 00:09:27.56 Small town.
00:09:27.56 --> 00:09:28.56 Yep.
00:09:28.56 --> 00:09:30.56 So north of San Francisco.
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:33.16 But today is a D.A.
00:09:33.16 --> 00:09:34.16 So probably appropriate.
00:09:34.16 --> 00:09:35.16 We talked about that.
00:09:35.16 --> 00:09:38.96 My grandfather was killed in World War II, some very early age, surrounded by those silk
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:42.20 maps, who's an AV or marine, through the course air, which is that plain.
00:09:42.20 --> 00:09:43.20 Yeah.
00:09:43.20 --> 00:09:45.32 The goal wings that would fold up.
00:09:45.32 --> 00:09:48.84 Right about that time, there was a show black sheep squadron on TV.
00:09:48.84 --> 00:09:52.20 I went to an air show and met a pavy bointin before he passed away.
00:09:52.20 --> 00:09:53.36 He got his book signed.
00:09:53.36 --> 00:09:57.80 And so I always knew that the military was where I was going.
00:09:57.80 --> 00:10:00.28 Just earlier on, I didn't know exactly what that was going to be.
00:10:00.28 --> 00:10:02.48 But did you ever think about trying to be a pilot?
00:10:02.48 --> 00:10:04.28 You know, fleetingly, I'm sure I did.
00:10:04.28 --> 00:10:06.20 But do I Marine Corps?
00:10:06.20 --> 00:10:10.36 Immediately as a pilot, just to follow in the footsteps of my grandfather.
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:15.40 But in a became very obvious that the might skill set lay at a more primal level on the
00:10:15.40 --> 00:10:18.32 round, which is attracted to that for some reason.
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:21.16 Probably a lot of, well, in the DNA for sure.
00:10:21.16 --> 00:10:26.16 But also the influence of popular culture, the books and movies that I read, growing up,
00:10:26.16 --> 00:10:30.04 those are the guys that I, that I wanted to be like and had backgrounds that I wanted
00:10:30.04 --> 00:10:31.04 to have one day.
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:33.96 But my grandfather didn't make a back from World War II.
00:10:33.96 --> 00:10:38.72 He was killed off Okinawa in 1945 in May, so near the end of the war.
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:43.80 And his wings made a back, all pictures of his black and white pictures of his squadron
00:10:43.80 --> 00:10:47.44 and by his plane, the silk maps they gave a year back then, because they hit the water
00:10:47.44 --> 00:10:50.80 with paper, they had just disintegrated, so they had these silk maps.
00:10:50.80 --> 00:10:55.04 So I just grew up with him, really, as kind of the ideal hero, I guess.
00:10:55.04 --> 00:10:58.96 Obviously, that were met, I'm an either, to my dad, because it was a born-well.
00:10:58.96 --> 00:10:59.96 He was deployed.
00:10:59.96 --> 00:11:04.24 So, so, grew up with just knowing, took the military with my calling, there was never anything
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:05.40 else I wanted to do.
00:11:05.40 --> 00:11:08.04 And then, early on, I found out what seals were.
00:11:08.04 --> 00:11:09.04 And your mom was a librarian?
00:11:09.04 --> 00:11:11.04 Yep, yep, still is to this day.
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:12.44 And so, were you into reading?
00:11:12.44 --> 00:11:15.08 Yep, yeah, a group surrounded by books.
00:11:15.08 --> 00:11:19.44 And she had just always naturally gravitated when I got to be about fifth grade, I'd say,
00:11:19.44 --> 00:11:22.20 towards the things that the adults are reading at the time.
00:11:22.20 --> 00:11:27.96 So Tom Clancy, David Morrell, Nelson Demil, AJ Quinnell, J.C. Pollock, Mark Olden,
00:11:27.96 --> 00:11:32.88 these guys in the 80s that had protagonist with seal backgrounds or CIA backgrounds or
00:11:32.88 --> 00:11:34.16 a special forces background.
00:11:34.16 --> 00:11:40.12 So, not having the internet and not having that many non-fiction books written about seals.
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:41.12 That's what I read.
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:42.96 And I knew this is where I'm going.
00:11:42.96 --> 00:11:46.48 And then after that's done, I want to write fiction like these guys.
00:11:46.48 --> 00:11:48.88 So those are the two things that I wanted to do with my life.
00:11:48.88 --> 00:11:52.68 How old were you and you actually found out about the seal teams in fifth grade?
00:11:52.68 --> 00:11:55.64 Seven, so second grade.
00:11:55.64 --> 00:11:56.64 Second grade?
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64 Yep, you found out about the seal teams?
00:11:57.64 --> 00:11:58.64 Yep, from what?
00:11:58.64 --> 00:12:01.36 So back then there were four channels back then growing up.
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:06.36 So there was ABC, CBS, NBC, and then that one outlier channel that always had some, we're
00:12:06.36 --> 00:12:08.96 the more two movie on it going all the time.
00:12:08.96 --> 00:12:11.56 And I was at a remote control back in the late 70s.
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:14.08 So the Sundays were football days.
00:12:14.08 --> 00:12:16.28 And I was not interested in football at all.
00:12:16.28 --> 00:12:19.60 But I was interested in that warm movie to have planned opposite football.
00:12:19.60 --> 00:12:22.12 So at a commercial, my dad would look at his watch.
00:12:22.12 --> 00:12:24.96 And I can still remember it to this day, sit on the couch and he said, go.
00:12:24.96 --> 00:12:29.44 And I'd have two minutes to run up, change that channel to that outlier channel.
00:12:29.44 --> 00:12:33.76 And then sit back down, watch that movie, and then he, say, turn it back back to football
00:12:33.76 --> 00:12:34.76 two minutes later.
00:12:34.76 --> 00:12:35.76 So I got to do that.
00:12:35.76 --> 00:12:39.12 And then I just went through the football parts and then run up and change it to whatever
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:40.12 warm movie was planned.
00:12:40.12 --> 00:12:42.92 So this car is an attention deficit disorder without question.
00:12:42.92 --> 00:12:43.92 Maybe he has the train.
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:46.40 He has the incredible patience and imagination.
00:12:46.40 --> 00:12:48.40 You got to fill in the blanks, direct that.
00:12:48.40 --> 00:12:49.40 That might be it.
00:12:49.40 --> 00:12:50.40 That might be it.
00:12:50.40 --> 00:12:53.40 And yeah, so one of those movies was the frogman.
00:12:53.40 --> 00:12:57.96 It showed these guys climb up over the beaches ahead of a conventional force landing
00:12:57.96 --> 00:13:00.44 and put an explosives on these obstacles.
00:13:00.44 --> 00:13:02.96 And I asked my dad, hey, who are these guys?
00:13:02.96 --> 00:13:04.32 And he said those are frogmen.
00:13:04.32 --> 00:13:06.08 And he said, okay, what's a frogman?
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:07.80 He said, ask your mother.
00:13:07.80 --> 00:13:08.80 So I did.
00:13:08.80 --> 00:13:12.80 And then we went down to the local library because she would take any excuse to get us to the
00:13:12.80 --> 00:13:13.80 library and do research.
00:13:13.80 --> 00:13:17.40 Show us how to use the do-ey-destinal system, pull out the card, things, the whole deal,
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:19.000 and did a little research.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.16 And there was hardly anything written back then.
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:24.76 There was a couple magazines that had mentions of seals, a couple nonfiction books that
00:13:24.76 --> 00:13:27.08 had a chapter or a paragraph or two on seals.
00:13:27.08 --> 00:13:28.08 It was not much at all.
00:13:28.08 --> 00:13:29.08 Not much at all.
00:13:29.08 --> 00:13:33.36 And but my takeaway was that these guys are touted anyway as one of the most elite
00:13:33.36 --> 00:13:35.04 fighting forces in the world.
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:37.96 And the training is the toughest ever-devised biomatering military.
00:13:37.96 --> 00:13:38.96 Arguably.
00:13:38.96 --> 00:13:39.96 That was my deal.
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:40.96 That was my deal.
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:41.96 That was my deal.
00:13:41.96 --> 00:13:42.96 That was my deal.
00:13:42.96 --> 00:13:43.96 That was my deal.
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:44.96 That was my deal.
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:45.96 That's the same thing.
00:13:45.96 --> 00:13:46.96 We all know that's an arguable name.
00:13:46.96 --> 00:13:47.96 Exactly.
00:13:47.96 --> 00:13:48.96 There's all kinds of different heart parts of all different training.
00:13:48.96 --> 00:13:51.36 Did go eat Nemori, one Emori a day.
00:13:51.36 --> 00:13:52.96 I would not be a happy camper.
00:13:52.96 --> 00:13:56.56 But so everyone's got their little, their little challenges.
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.16 I heard the same thing.
00:13:58.16 --> 00:13:59.16 Exactly.
00:13:59.16 --> 00:14:00.16 And yeah.
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:00.96 And you find out that it's a-
00:14:00.96 --> 00:14:02.36 So what did you do?
00:14:02.36 --> 00:14:04.76 Did you start preparing for it physically?
00:14:04.76 --> 00:14:05.76 Yep.
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:06.76 Oh yeah.
00:14:06.76 --> 00:14:07.76 Everything I did from that.
00:14:07.76 --> 00:14:10.16 So I guess I did an early form of crossfit.
00:14:10.16 --> 00:14:11.16 I guess.
00:14:11.16 --> 00:14:13.96 Before a crossfit was the thing in high school.
00:14:13.96 --> 00:14:17.80 So not in the younger years, you know, how I was to play in soccer,
00:14:17.80 --> 00:14:19.60 running around cross country, doing all that sort of.
00:14:19.60 --> 00:14:22.000 But I do credit cross country in those hills,
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.20 and Northern California, with given me four
00:14:24.20 --> 00:14:26.20 memories in that no never quit.
00:14:26.20 --> 00:14:28.000 I see people stop it on the hill that was giving me.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.40 And would you like a pretty good runner?
00:14:29.40 --> 00:14:30.20 I was okay.
00:14:30.20 --> 00:14:31.20 Yeah, it was good.
00:14:31.20 --> 00:14:33.40 But there were some guys that were really, really good.
00:14:33.40 --> 00:14:36.40 Mine was just, you know, dog and determination, really.
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:39.20 So I was pretty good, but not the greatest.
00:14:39.20 --> 00:14:41.80 And you know, but I love it when I'd see people walking,
00:14:41.80 --> 00:14:42.60 especially on the hills.
00:14:42.60 --> 00:14:44.60 When people from the flat lands would come up to our horse
00:14:44.60 --> 00:14:47.20 and they put that first hill and just a walk,
00:14:47.20 --> 00:14:48.20 we would just devastate them.
00:14:48.20 --> 00:14:50.60 And that which is I just feed off that kind of like in a week
00:14:50.60 --> 00:14:53.000 when people would quit and I always feel bad talking about this.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000 But I mean, it's true.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000 Some people would say, come back, no, don't quit.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000 Come back.
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.20 I didn't say one or see this later.
00:14:59.20 --> 00:15:00.40 This is so solid.
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:01.000 Exactly.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.80 This is what this program is designed to do.
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:05.60 And so I kind of fed off that I guess.
00:15:05.60 --> 00:15:06.000 I love this.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.90 Especially when the biggest strongest fastest guys for those first three
00:15:08.90 --> 00:15:12.000 weeks or whatever it was, but what's the first couple?
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000 What's the first couple?
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.20 Just, just quitting first couple hours.
00:15:15.20 --> 00:15:15.80 I don't know.
00:15:15.80 --> 00:15:18.20 People said that was going to happen and it did.
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:21.000 And I'm just studs where I thought to myself, wow, this guy
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.80 seems like a complete stud mentally physically.
00:15:25.80 --> 00:15:29.60 Just legit and then just go way to go right away.
00:15:29.60 --> 00:15:30.60 How is that?
00:15:30.60 --> 00:15:32.20 I don't know, but I would look at these guys when I first
00:15:32.20 --> 00:15:33.40 showed up the buds and like, man, like,
00:15:33.40 --> 00:15:36.80 I shoot out and he's doing crazy climbing these ropes.
00:15:36.80 --> 00:15:39.80 He's like, oh my, can look at him going those monkey bar
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:43.20 things and chase how am I going to make it through if this guy
00:15:43.20 --> 00:15:45.80 like, like, like that here and he quits.
00:15:45.80 --> 00:15:47.20 I'm like, oh, I see how this works.
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:50.000 Yeah, you're men I get weak exactly.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000 I can do this.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.40 So, so you did running?
00:15:53.40 --> 00:15:55.000 Yeah, you did cross the country.
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000 Yeah, early on, did that stuff soccer.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.60 The cross in high school.
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:02.000 But then I'd ride my bike to school, which was, I don't know,
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.40 how I like at least 10 miles I guess.
00:16:04.40 --> 00:16:09.20 So early morning, the California cold and because I was part of training
00:16:09.20 --> 00:16:14.20 and I'd get home and we have this kind of place at whatever from one of our kids.
00:16:14.20 --> 00:16:17.20 And I do pull up so I'll be holding different,
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:21.000 trying to make an obstacle course for myself when I got home.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.20 And I would be knocking out like 20 pull ups at whatever 13, 14 years old.
00:16:25.20 --> 00:16:29.80 And then go have like some pasta or a piece of bread with butter on it
00:16:29.80 --> 00:16:30.60 for my snack.
00:16:30.60 --> 00:16:31.60 Yeah, yeah.
00:16:31.60 --> 00:16:36.60 And start training, start training martial arts pretty early too.
00:16:36.60 --> 00:16:41.40 But I was searching because local Taiwan dope place, right?
00:16:41.40 --> 00:16:43.80 And you're doing some kada stuff and you're doing a little bit.
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:46.80 Can you even hear how old were you?
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:49.20 That would probably be fresh, but I was 14, let's say.
00:16:49.20 --> 00:16:52.000 So even as a 14 year old, you're like, wow.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.20 Like this seems like it may work, but it also seems like,
00:16:56.20 --> 00:16:58.000 what if someone hits me in the face?
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.80 Yeah, yeah, work.
00:16:59.80 --> 00:17:00.80 Right.
00:17:00.80 --> 00:17:01.80 13 year old.
00:17:01.80 --> 00:17:02.80 Yeah, kind of picked up on that.
00:17:02.80 --> 00:17:04.80 Yeah, which is, I give you credit.
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:06.80 Well, because I'm guys can be convincing.
00:17:06.80 --> 00:17:11.40 You know, yeah, that's how you see these videos of people online that are making
00:17:11.40 --> 00:17:15.80 people fall down by a pointing out of middle area, yelling their key eye out of them.
00:17:15.80 --> 00:17:16.80 I know, it's very nice.
00:17:16.80 --> 00:17:20.60 People literally fall down and start shaking.
00:17:20.60 --> 00:17:21.60 It's crazy.
00:17:21.60 --> 00:17:22.60 Yeah, it's crazy.
00:17:22.60 --> 00:17:23.80 But I can add grew up also.
00:17:23.80 --> 00:17:24.60 Like, talk about that.
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:26.80 It's the influence of popular culture.
00:17:26.80 --> 00:17:28.80 So Rocky movies.
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:31.80 I was just, wow, man, that's fighting right there.
00:17:31.80 --> 00:17:32.80 I want to learn how to do that.
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:34.80 How do I learn how to do that and know what I'm going to call for you?
00:17:34.80 --> 00:17:36.80 Well, there wasn't really a place to go.
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:40.96 But that, that, that, that, tenacity, you know, they get enough every time you get knocked
00:17:40.96 --> 00:17:41.96 down.
00:17:41.96 --> 00:17:43.60 Like, I think those things really wore off on me.
00:17:43.60 --> 00:17:47.000 Like, I took that seriously and still do to this day.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.60 What kind of music were you listening to?
00:17:48.60 --> 00:17:51.60 I didn't really do the music thing to the last few years.
00:17:51.60 --> 00:17:52.60 Really?
00:17:52.60 --> 00:17:53.60 It was like quite.
00:17:53.60 --> 00:17:54.60 Yep.
00:17:54.60 --> 00:17:58.40 I realized I'm starting to give music less credit than I used to.
00:17:58.40 --> 00:18:01.60 First, I used to look, I used to, when I meet people and I talk to them for a little
00:18:01.60 --> 00:18:02.60 bit.
00:18:02.60 --> 00:18:04.40 I mean, music did you listen to grown up?
00:18:04.40 --> 00:18:10.000 Because it would always kind of fill me in about kind of who they were because when
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.64 we grew up, you, you only listen to what you kind of, you, you didn't get exposed to a
00:18:14.64 --> 00:18:15.64 bunch of stuff.
00:18:15.64 --> 00:18:18.48 You kind of had to figure it out and go down that channel.
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:22.68 And so if you listen to heavy metal, okay, I see, you know, I see what you do.
00:18:22.68 --> 00:18:26.36 And or you listen to, you know, Leonard Skinner, okay, cool, I get where I get.
00:18:26.36 --> 00:18:28.80 I could, you could just kind of know because people wouldn't say, because what does
00:18:28.80 --> 00:18:30.000 everyone say now, what do you listen to?
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.88 They say everything, because everything's free.
00:18:31.88 --> 00:18:34.48 They can listen to all this different kinds and it's just wide open.
00:18:34.48 --> 00:18:36.96 And that's what all these kids say nowadays.
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:39.80 Oh, I listen to everything, a little bit of everything.
00:18:39.80 --> 00:18:41.16 And so don't offend anyone.
00:18:41.16 --> 00:18:42.16 Yeah.
00:18:42.16 --> 00:18:43.16 Yeah.
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:44.16 And so you just weren't even in the music.
00:18:44.16 --> 00:18:46.76 No, not until I got my driver's license and then I got, you know, had to because
00:18:46.76 --> 00:18:48.92 you had other people in the car and they bring a cassette tape.
00:18:48.92 --> 00:18:52.32 I'm going to make a mixed tape and put that thing in.
00:18:52.32 --> 00:18:56.16 And for whatever reason, when I grew up, people listened to stuff like 60s, 70s.
00:18:56.16 --> 00:18:57.16 That's the same thing.
00:18:57.16 --> 00:19:05.44 Well, my dad had a baricuda and the car, like the sports car, like a set of three
00:19:05.44 --> 00:19:09.28 baricuda yellow with and you're saying it impressed.
00:19:09.28 --> 00:19:10.28 Yeah.
00:19:10.28 --> 00:19:15.68 But it was not because it was my dad being a broke teacher, needed a new car and
00:19:15.68 --> 00:19:20.76 went out and paid whatever 1, 1800 bucks for this car that was rusty, but it had an
00:19:20.76 --> 00:19:21.76 eight track in it.
00:19:21.76 --> 00:19:22.76 I'm sorry.
00:19:22.76 --> 00:19:25.76 And my dad, I think he had one eight track and it was Hank Williams.
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:27.12 Like Hank, well, that's it.
00:19:27.12 --> 00:19:28.56 Yeah, Hank Williams senior.
00:19:28.56 --> 00:19:31.20 So we listened to a lot of Hank Williams when I was growing up.
00:19:31.20 --> 00:19:32.36 We had Kenny Rogers.
00:19:32.36 --> 00:19:33.36 Yeah.
00:19:33.36 --> 00:19:34.36 We had the gambler.
00:19:34.36 --> 00:19:35.36 I'm sorry to hear that.
00:19:35.36 --> 00:19:36.72 We had the gambler every morning.
00:19:36.72 --> 00:19:37.72 I got off for school.
00:19:37.72 --> 00:19:38.72 Wasn't an eight track.
00:19:38.72 --> 00:19:39.88 I think my dad was an early adopter.
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:42.92 But he's very good because yeah, he got a good sense with the cassette player.
00:19:42.92 --> 00:19:43.92 Exactly.
00:19:43.92 --> 00:19:46.72 And I remember this day every day on the way to school was the gambler.
00:19:46.72 --> 00:19:47.72 Yeah.
00:19:47.72 --> 00:19:48.72 All right.
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:49.92 So what did your dad do?
00:19:49.92 --> 00:19:52.68 I was in attorney at that time and then got into real estate.
00:19:52.68 --> 00:19:55.92 Probably later on and then retired early.
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:59.24 So okay, so you're now at what point did you say?
00:19:59.24 --> 00:20:02.40 Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to go for sure.
00:20:02.40 --> 00:20:04.12 Like what point was this 10 years old?
00:20:04.12 --> 00:20:05.12 Was this 12 years old?
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:06.12 Seven, seven years old.
00:20:06.12 --> 00:20:07.12 All right.
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:08.12 Yeah, this is what I'm doing.
00:20:08.12 --> 00:20:12.24 And what made you decide anything else significant from high school?
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:14.000 Your playing soccer, your playing the cross.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000 Yeah.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000 Run and pull ups on the monkey.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000 Back in forever.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000 Trail running.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.68 All that sort of thing is getting ready thinking about my next steps.
00:20:21.68 --> 00:20:24.20 And no one that there was going to be a little bit of pause there to go to college
00:20:24.20 --> 00:20:27.28 first, just in case because we have to have contingency plans to share.
00:20:27.28 --> 00:20:29.84 So you looked and said like, okay, I'm going to go to college.
00:20:29.84 --> 00:20:30.84 Yeah.
00:20:30.84 --> 00:20:31.84 Yeah.
00:20:31.84 --> 00:20:36.36 That's what I need to do that because I need to get stronger, bigger, faster.
00:20:36.36 --> 00:20:37.84 And I thought I needed to do anyone else.
00:20:37.84 --> 00:20:39.04 I don't know if that's the case or not.
00:20:39.04 --> 00:20:40.04 But probably not.
00:20:40.04 --> 00:20:43.80 But you were just more humble and you were saying, hey, I need to be in better shape.
00:20:43.80 --> 00:20:46.16 And I thought there was eight guys on a seal team.
00:20:46.16 --> 00:20:48.96 And I was going to be one of those guys and if I was going to be one of those guys, I
00:20:48.96 --> 00:20:51.24 needed to be in the best possible shape.
00:20:51.24 --> 00:20:56.72 And at that time, the best possible shape looked like Stallone and looked like Arnold.
00:20:56.72 --> 00:20:59.40 So I did not look like either of those guys.
00:20:59.40 --> 00:21:00.40 And I still don't.
00:21:00.40 --> 00:21:01.40 I never did.
00:21:01.40 --> 00:21:04.16 But I thought, I needed to hit the iron here.
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:05.84 I need to get boxing.
00:21:05.84 --> 00:21:08.16 And I did a little bit in high school.
00:21:08.16 --> 00:21:12.72 So back to that martial arts school, the Taekwondo thing that was an instructor there.
00:21:12.72 --> 00:21:13.72 It's kind of new.
00:21:13.72 --> 00:21:15.16 This wasn't quite the deal.
00:21:15.16 --> 00:21:17.60 Like a brown belt in Taekwondo.
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:20.44 And then from my last, I guess, you're in a half of high school.
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:22.08 He wanted to start his own thing.
00:21:22.08 --> 00:21:24.88 And so I go pick him up in my car because you didn't have one.
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:26.16 And we go to the local park.
00:21:26.16 --> 00:21:27.16 And we boxed.
00:21:27.16 --> 00:21:30.16 And it was like, jab reverse hook.
00:21:30.16 --> 00:21:32.20 And then I gave him the basics.
00:21:32.20 --> 00:21:33.92 And that was awesome.
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:35.20 One, two, three.
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:36.20 I absolutely love it.
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:37.20 That was the largest 24 hours.
00:21:37.20 --> 00:21:38.20 Yes.
00:21:38.20 --> 00:21:39.20 Exactly.
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:40.20 The one tuned through.
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:42.48 My learned about it, Taekwondo was, you know, like, because he did some wrestling.
00:21:42.48 --> 00:21:44.20 Oh, so I had to do a little of that.
00:21:44.20 --> 00:21:45.20 This guy was early MMA.
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:46.20 Exactly.
00:21:46.20 --> 00:21:47.20 Exactly.
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:48.20 Yep.
00:21:48.20 --> 00:21:49.20 He told me he had a car.
00:21:49.20 --> 00:21:50.20 Yeah.
00:21:50.20 --> 00:21:51.20 He was a good early MMA subman.
00:21:51.20 --> 00:21:52.20 That's such a great thing.
00:21:52.20 --> 00:21:53.20 And he's still doing it today.
00:21:53.20 --> 00:21:54.20 Yeah.
00:21:54.20 --> 00:21:56.44 Mike Valentine is now in cinema and you hear his buddy has a place up in New
00:21:56.44 --> 00:21:57.44 California.
00:21:57.44 --> 00:21:58.44 And he's still doing it.
00:21:58.44 --> 00:22:01.12 And as soon as he found out about your Getsu, he was doing that.
00:22:01.12 --> 00:22:02.12 Oh, good for him.
00:22:02.12 --> 00:22:06.04 He was driving a San Francisco and working out with whoever was the San Francisco guy in the
00:22:06.04 --> 00:22:07.04 early 90s, I guess.
00:22:07.04 --> 00:22:08.04 And yes.
00:22:08.04 --> 00:22:09.04 Yes.
00:22:09.04 --> 00:22:10.04 We were talking about health.
00:22:10.04 --> 00:22:11.04 Gracie.
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:12.04 I don't know.
00:22:12.04 --> 00:22:13.04 Charles Gracie, babe.
00:22:13.04 --> 00:22:14.04 There's a bunch of options up there.
00:22:14.04 --> 00:22:15.04 Yeah.
00:22:15.04 --> 00:22:16.04 But nobody was really doing that.
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:17.04 Nobody was mixing stuff up like that.
00:22:17.04 --> 00:22:18.04 I knew about anyway.
00:22:18.04 --> 00:22:22.12 My little town of whatever, you know, of many people that was.
00:22:22.12 --> 00:22:23.40 But then I just kept on that path.
00:22:23.40 --> 00:22:26.08 Just kept on I thought it was going to be a lifelong path.
00:22:26.08 --> 00:22:28.52 And but I peaked in about 95.
00:22:28.52 --> 00:22:29.52 And that was in college.
00:22:29.52 --> 00:22:30.52 Yeah.
00:22:30.52 --> 00:22:31.52 So you end up going to college.
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:33.28 What do you go to study college for?
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:35.80 Well, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
00:22:35.80 --> 00:22:37.52 So I get to the seal teams.
00:22:37.52 --> 00:22:39.96 And so justice studies seem to be criminology.
00:22:39.96 --> 00:22:44.08 It seemed to be the thing that you could just, hey, that's kind of interesting.
00:22:44.08 --> 00:22:46.92 And I can get through this thing in four years and get to the teams.
00:22:46.92 --> 00:22:50.04 And your backup plan would have been some kind of cop or something like that.
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:53.36 I guess, but I didn't really waste too much time thinking about a backup plan.
00:22:53.36 --> 00:22:56.32 I just knew that college having that degree was the backup plan.
00:22:56.32 --> 00:22:57.76 But I'd figure that out later.
00:22:57.76 --> 00:23:01.60 It was full on devoted to figuring out how to get to the teams.
00:23:01.60 --> 00:23:05.60 And then being the best shape, I could mentally physically spiritually before I got there.
00:23:05.60 --> 00:23:09.40 When did you go to a recruiter, what year of college after I finished?
00:23:09.40 --> 00:23:10.40 After you finished college?
00:23:10.40 --> 00:23:12.40 I thought it was going to be like four years ago.
00:23:12.40 --> 00:23:15.84 Like you go to the recruiter and there's a bus waiting outside and you walk through and
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:17.08 you get on the bus and off you go.
00:23:17.08 --> 00:23:18.68 I know totally ignorant.
00:23:18.68 --> 00:23:19.68 Yeah, it's crazy.
00:23:19.68 --> 00:23:21.32 It's very weird until you do it.
00:23:21.32 --> 00:23:24.20 Well, I did research enough to find out that there was something called a die of
00:23:24.20 --> 00:23:25.20 ferro program.
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:28.08 And my recruiter didn't even know what it was.
00:23:28.08 --> 00:23:31.32 But I was in the back of a book and I forget the name of the book, a paperback book,
00:23:31.32 --> 00:23:33.52 the talk about all sorts of different special operations.
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:37.000 And I had like one paragraph on how to get to those places.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.44 But the seal, it said die of ferro program.
00:23:39.44 --> 00:23:40.44 So I went in there.
00:23:40.44 --> 00:23:42.44 It was kind of a scam.
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:43.92 I did that program too.
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:46.52 Total scam. Like they get you to sign on for six years.
00:23:46.52 --> 00:23:50.56 And they said you guaranteed a chance to try out.
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:51.56 Yeah, that's all I need.
00:23:51.56 --> 00:23:52.56 That's what I want.
00:23:52.56 --> 00:23:53.56 I want the guaranteed to try out.
00:23:53.56 --> 00:23:54.56 That's all I need.
00:23:54.56 --> 00:23:58.40 And then you get to bootcamp and everybody got a chance and when I was there anyway.
00:23:58.40 --> 00:23:59.40 To try out.
00:23:59.40 --> 00:24:00.68 I signed up for six.
00:24:00.68 --> 00:24:03.52 These guys for four and we all get the chance to ding it.
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:06.24 But anyway, ended up spending the 20 years in anyway.
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:06.88 Yeah.
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:10.04 So what year was it that you actually listed in the Navy?
00:24:10.04 --> 00:24:11.04 96.
00:24:11.04 --> 00:24:11.68 96.
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:13.84 So got an I thought like I said a thousand of walk.
00:24:13.84 --> 00:24:14.84 I don't know that bus.
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:16.72 And then I'm training and I roll my ankle.
00:24:16.72 --> 00:24:18.88 And I'm like oh man, that's going to be the end.
00:24:18.88 --> 00:24:20.32 And I can't believe it's like this huge.
00:24:20.32 --> 00:24:23.56 I thought it was broken and it'd up just been whatever.
00:24:23.56 --> 00:24:24.56 That's brave.
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:25.56 Yeah, nothing.
00:24:25.56 --> 00:24:26.56 That must be what ever.
00:24:26.56 --> 00:24:28.52 It's how like blue 21.
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:31.28 And yeah, so you think like I think it's black and blue ankle.
00:24:31.28 --> 00:24:32.28 It's huge.
00:24:32.28 --> 00:24:34.28 And it's like oh man, what did I do?
00:24:34.28 --> 00:24:35.28 I was trying to run.
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:36.28 Why was I training that day?
00:24:36.28 --> 00:24:37.80 I should have just been just relaxed.
00:24:37.80 --> 00:24:38.80 Not gotten hurt.
00:24:38.80 --> 00:24:42.40 And then so I'm going to crush this for a couple of months and then go back after it.
00:24:42.40 --> 00:24:43.56 And got the pool.
00:24:43.56 --> 00:24:48.56 How long was it from the time you enlisted until the time you shipped out?
00:24:48.56 --> 00:24:51.72 Gosh, you know, there's all those things you're supposed to do ahead of time when you're
00:24:51.72 --> 00:24:52.72 on.
00:24:52.72 --> 00:24:54.72 For the call, you're supposed to be going to classes.
00:24:54.72 --> 00:24:55.72 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:24:55.72 --> 00:24:56.72 I didn't do any of that.
00:24:56.72 --> 00:24:59.32 I didn't do any of that stuff though because it was encouraged.
00:24:59.32 --> 00:25:01.56 But I somewhere I found out it was not mandatory.
00:25:01.56 --> 00:25:04.56 And I was like okay good because I don't want to have to, you know, do whatever.
00:25:04.56 --> 00:25:05.56 These 10 pushups with these people.
00:25:05.56 --> 00:25:06.80 I need to be actually training.
00:25:06.80 --> 00:25:08.80 Was it a month though?
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:09.80 No, it was.
00:25:09.80 --> 00:25:10.80 It was months.
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:11.80 Yeah, it was years.
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:12.80 No, it was like five months.
00:25:12.80 --> 00:25:13.80 Or something like that.
00:25:13.80 --> 00:25:15.40 That's just like a little heads up to people.
00:25:15.40 --> 00:25:18.12 Like you think what like what you thought, which is what I thought.
00:25:18.12 --> 00:25:20.80 Hey, once I sign up, I'm just going to get on a bus.
00:25:20.80 --> 00:25:21.80 That's cool.
00:25:21.80 --> 00:25:22.80 I'm good.
00:25:22.80 --> 00:25:25.80 And really you get to go survive for another five months.
00:25:25.80 --> 00:25:27.24 You're saying, what's as you're waiting to go?
00:25:27.24 --> 00:25:29.96 Because you have certain billets allowed and all this stuff.
00:25:29.96 --> 00:25:30.96 So it's kind of a pain.
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:32.40 Yep, and you got to do the medical stuff.
00:25:32.40 --> 00:25:33.40 The dental stuff.
00:25:33.40 --> 00:25:34.40 Take the ad.
00:25:34.40 --> 00:25:35.40 Bad.
00:25:35.40 --> 00:25:36.68 And all that sort of thing to get ready.
00:25:36.68 --> 00:25:40.44 So those, I think a couple trips over the main recruiting station to do all those sorts of
00:25:40.44 --> 00:25:44.24 things, get out of the paperwork and line, and then off you go.
00:25:44.24 --> 00:25:47.20 And then I was, and now they have every, all the people that are going to be in some sort
00:25:47.20 --> 00:25:49.20 of naval special warfare.
00:25:49.20 --> 00:25:50.20 Yeah, something.
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:51.20 It's more square to wear.
00:25:51.20 --> 00:25:57.48 Yeah, they go through like, they go to Chicago, I think, for eight weeks.
00:25:57.48 --> 00:25:58.88 So get ready for bugs.
00:25:58.88 --> 00:25:59.88 Yep.
00:25:59.88 --> 00:26:00.88 So you shut up to bugs.
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:01.88 Were you ready for bugs?
00:26:01.88 --> 00:26:04.32 As always, this ready is one could possibly be.
00:26:04.32 --> 00:26:06.12 With all that training and all that thought.
00:26:06.12 --> 00:26:07.36 And then I knew, hey, there's no way I'm quitting.
00:26:07.36 --> 00:26:11.32 It's all my friends growing up knew that I wanted to do this until it's seven.
00:26:11.32 --> 00:26:13.16 And so there's no way I'm quit him and die.
00:26:13.16 --> 00:26:15.40 I can't go home and tell him I didn't make it.
00:26:15.40 --> 00:26:18.56 You know what's weird is people do that right there, and they still quit.
00:26:18.56 --> 00:26:20.68 Yeah, which boggles my mind.
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:26.16 I, the, the, the quitting thing is hard for me to comprehend.
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:30.000 And when I hear about people doing it, look, people like that, you know, there was a guy
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.88 that killed himself recently.
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:33.60 And he was that guy.
00:26:33.60 --> 00:26:37.64 And he had told everyone I'm going to be a seal and he had trained for it and he prepared
00:26:37.64 --> 00:26:39.04 for it and he looked like a stud.
00:26:39.04 --> 00:26:41.28 He looked like a beast of a kid.
00:26:41.28 --> 00:26:45.36 And he played lacrosse and he was varsity this and captain of that.
00:26:45.36 --> 00:26:51.52 I mean, and then he got two bugs and for whatever reason, he quit and then he, and then
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:53.40 he killed himself.
00:26:53.40 --> 00:27:00.24 And you just think, man, like, whatever they're telling you in bugs, you don't quit.
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:03.04 He said, you know, just don't quit.
00:27:03.04 --> 00:27:04.04 It's pretty easy.
00:27:04.04 --> 00:27:06.12 Yeah, just do not quit.
00:27:06.12 --> 00:27:11.32 And I know they play psychological games on people of saying, you know, let's say, you
00:27:11.32 --> 00:27:13.40 don't belong here and all this kind of stuff.
00:27:13.40 --> 00:27:16.16 I don't even remember if they said that to me, I didn't care what they said to me.
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:20.40 It wasn't even, kind of, trading, anything in my brain.
00:27:20.40 --> 00:27:21.40 But you know, that's what they do.
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.96 They'll say, oh, you don't belong here.
00:27:22.96 --> 00:27:24.52 We don't want you on the team.
00:27:24.52 --> 00:27:30.64 And somebody that's sensitive to that, it can get through to share and make them start believing
00:27:30.64 --> 00:27:33.000 that the instructors actually, the instructors are going to leave.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000 We even go order a pizza.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.84 They're not actually thinking about that, you know?
00:27:36.84 --> 00:27:38.48 But they take some get and they quit.
00:27:38.48 --> 00:27:39.48 And you know what?
00:27:39.48 --> 00:27:40.48 Good.
00:27:40.48 --> 00:27:41.48 Like you said, like, good.
00:27:41.48 --> 00:27:45.48 If someone has that, if someone is going to quit, please quit during bugs.
00:27:45.48 --> 00:27:46.48 Yeah, for sure.
00:27:46.48 --> 00:27:48.88 Did you guys watch a full-metal jacket?
00:27:48.88 --> 00:27:52.48 I mean, all these movies that they show, join instructors on what it's like.
00:27:52.48 --> 00:27:53.48 And it's like a game.
00:27:53.48 --> 00:27:54.48 Yeah, you're going to be a game.
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:57.72 Did you have any trouble with anything about bugs?
00:27:57.72 --> 00:28:02.60 So I swam before I got there and I'd wake up super early and meet the Master Swim
00:28:02.60 --> 00:28:06.28 program at five in the morning because I knew swimming was my weak point.
00:28:06.28 --> 00:28:07.28 I mean, I swam.
00:28:07.28 --> 00:28:10.08 I don't know problem with swimming, but I wasn't a competitive swimmer.
00:28:10.08 --> 00:28:13.28 You were so much more prepared for bugs than me.
00:28:13.28 --> 00:28:18.20 I'm just like, even the fact that you analyzed like what your strengths and weaknesses were,
00:28:18.20 --> 00:28:22.68 I was just, I was just like, another way to go.
00:28:22.68 --> 00:28:23.68 Yeah.
00:28:23.68 --> 00:28:24.68 I worked out.
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:25.68 Yeah.
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:26.68 That was young too, which is beneficial.
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:29.28 You know, it's beneficial just to be young because you're just going to adapt.
00:28:29.28 --> 00:28:30.28 Right.
00:28:30.28 --> 00:28:31.88 I mean, your brain isn't even completely developed.
00:28:31.88 --> 00:28:32.88 Right.
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:33.88 So you're what 24.
00:28:33.88 --> 00:28:34.88 More than like that.
00:28:34.88 --> 00:28:35.88 So I know 18, 19 years old.
00:28:35.88 --> 00:28:39.88 I was just full adaptation to whatever they're doing.
00:28:39.88 --> 00:28:41.88 And it's what you have to do in life in general.
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:45.48 But I distinctly remember going to the pool.
00:28:45.48 --> 00:28:47.84 So I'm reattimagled at this point.
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:49.32 And I'm going to the pool now.
00:28:49.32 --> 00:28:50.32 And it's outdoors.
00:28:50.32 --> 00:28:51.32 And it's frost.
00:28:51.32 --> 00:28:52.32 This is frost.
00:28:52.32 --> 00:28:53.32 Pretty buzz.
00:28:53.32 --> 00:28:54.32 Yeah.
00:28:54.32 --> 00:28:55.32 So there's like not snow, but that frost.
00:28:55.32 --> 00:28:56.32 Lair of frost on the pool decks.
00:28:56.32 --> 00:28:57.88 Once you got in, it was actually kind of warm.
00:28:57.88 --> 00:29:01.12 But you shoved the walk across that pool deck and jump in with these people that are way
00:29:01.12 --> 00:29:03.000 older, but way faster.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.28 I was definitely the slowest person in this master's swim program with these people
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:09.28 and swim competitively and how they're 40 and which is old.
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:10.28 Yeah.
00:29:10.28 --> 00:29:11.28 And I'm 42 years old.
00:29:11.28 --> 00:29:12.64 There's those person who were receiving your life.
00:29:12.64 --> 00:29:15.44 And there's swim in it five in the morning.
00:29:15.44 --> 00:29:16.44 But so I did that.
00:29:16.44 --> 00:29:19.56 So I was prepared for the water.
00:29:19.56 --> 00:29:20.96 And I grew up in the water essentially.
00:29:20.96 --> 00:29:22.68 Scooplet and Scooplet having an age nine.
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:23.96 It was comfortable in the water.
00:29:23.96 --> 00:29:24.96 We helped out.
00:29:24.96 --> 00:29:26.68 One to again, you are so much more prepared.
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:30.52 I was like, you know, well, I mean, I was, I could swim.
00:29:30.52 --> 00:29:32.32 And I surfed as a kid and that helped.
00:29:32.32 --> 00:29:33.88 But I definitely wasn't Scooplet diving.
00:29:33.88 --> 00:29:37.44 Yeah, I was diving for Abeloni up north.
00:29:37.44 --> 00:29:38.44 So that's been with all this kind of thing.
00:29:38.44 --> 00:29:39.44 I don't know if I do that now.
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:41.56 It's like a great, white, and breeding ground up there.
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:42.76 But Abeloni was amazing.
00:29:42.76 --> 00:29:45.64 I love that we camp out up there and just have a great time.
00:29:45.64 --> 00:29:48.72 But even though I prepared like that, the swims were hard.
00:29:48.72 --> 00:29:52.12 And that first swim, because it's that under water recovery stroke in 1996, they didn't
00:29:52.12 --> 00:29:53.12 teach you.
00:29:53.12 --> 00:29:54.32 Now they teach you how to do this thing.
00:29:54.32 --> 00:29:55.80 Now they get in the water.
00:29:55.80 --> 00:29:56.80 Here's your little basics.
00:29:56.80 --> 00:29:57.80 Here's how you do it.
00:29:57.80 --> 00:29:58.80 Bring your head up.
00:29:58.80 --> 00:29:59.80 Whatever.
00:29:59.80 --> 00:30:00.80 Focus.
00:30:00.80 --> 00:30:01.80 This.
00:30:01.80 --> 00:30:01.80 Now the book is talked about this.
00:30:01.80 --> 00:30:02.80 Let me try to do it.
00:30:02.80 --> 00:30:03.80 We can get this.
00:30:03.80 --> 00:30:06.60 And it was not in the master swim program.
00:30:06.60 --> 00:30:08.000 And I was third to last.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000 I remember getting out of that first swim where they pair everybody up and whatever they
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.96 call it, the two weeks before you class up, whatever that thing is called.
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:16.40 And I was like, man, third to land.
00:30:16.40 --> 00:30:17.80 I can stagger out of the water.
00:30:17.80 --> 00:30:19.80 Like I put out onto this thing.
00:30:19.80 --> 00:30:24.72 And I'm like, wow, what's, and I went, they put everything up with this really slow guy.
00:30:24.72 --> 00:30:25.72 And I think he quit right away.
00:30:25.72 --> 00:30:28.48 So then they pair and put it up with somebody else who was faster.
00:30:28.48 --> 00:30:32.000 So I'm barely making the swims in first phase.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.52 And then one of the guys in my class was a water polo player from USC or something like
00:30:36.52 --> 00:30:37.52 that.
00:30:37.52 --> 00:30:40.52 And he's like, hey, what we have to teach you how to do this stroke.
00:30:40.52 --> 00:30:41.52 But yeah, it'd be great.
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:45.52 And so we went out behind the barracks thing and went out in the in the ocean.
00:30:45.52 --> 00:30:46.80 And he just showed me how to do it.
00:30:46.80 --> 00:30:49.32 And I went from being third to last to the next swim.
00:30:49.32 --> 00:30:50.32 I was third.
00:30:50.32 --> 00:30:51.32 There you go.
00:30:51.32 --> 00:30:52.32 That was awesome.
00:30:52.32 --> 00:30:53.32 And I was never third again.
00:30:53.32 --> 00:30:54.32 I was like fifth or sixth.
00:30:54.32 --> 00:30:57.16 But when we go in third to last, I distinctly remember to then come out third after
00:30:57.16 --> 00:30:58.16 learning the stroke.
00:30:58.16 --> 00:30:59.16 So I got this.
00:30:59.16 --> 00:31:01.40 It's different to swim with fins too.
00:31:01.40 --> 00:31:04.20 And the way they teach you to do it is a little bit different.
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:05.20 Whatever.
00:31:05.20 --> 00:31:06.20 But now they prepare.
00:31:06.20 --> 00:31:07.20 Now you're preparing.
00:31:07.20 --> 00:31:08.20 You're going in physically.
00:31:08.20 --> 00:31:10.80 That eight weeks they spend in Chicago.
00:31:10.80 --> 00:31:11.80 They learn the strokes.
00:31:11.80 --> 00:31:16.000 They learn how to lift the logs and not hurt themselves and how to use the boat.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.80 There's instructions on how to lift the logs.
00:31:17.80 --> 00:31:18.80 Pretty sure.
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:19.80 Oh, wow.
00:31:19.80 --> 00:31:20.80 How to climb the ropes.
00:31:20.80 --> 00:31:22.40 Mental toughness classes.
00:31:22.40 --> 00:31:23.40 All that stuff.
00:31:23.40 --> 00:31:24.40 Because they went.
00:31:24.40 --> 00:31:25.40 But you know what happened?
00:31:25.40 --> 00:31:26.40 Of course.
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:29.28 They were expecting a lot more shields to come through now because they needed more in
00:31:29.28 --> 00:31:31.16 2003, five, four, five, six.
00:31:31.16 --> 00:31:32.16 We need more seals.
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:33.64 So let's do this program.
00:31:33.64 --> 00:31:35.96 And now we just got the Fitter Quitters.
00:31:35.96 --> 00:31:36.96 So same essentially.
00:31:36.96 --> 00:31:37.96 Yeah, that's the crazy thing.
00:31:37.96 --> 00:31:38.96 Yeah.
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:40.20 The crazy thing is the attrition rate doesn't change.
00:31:40.20 --> 00:31:41.20 Exactly.
00:31:41.20 --> 00:31:42.20 Fitter Quitters.
00:31:42.20 --> 00:31:43.20 Fitter Quitters.
00:31:43.20 --> 00:31:44.20 I like that.
00:31:44.20 --> 00:31:45.88 Because it doesn't matter how many poles you can do.
00:31:45.88 --> 00:31:48.000 I mean, it does matter.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.60 And people say mental or physical.
00:31:49.60 --> 00:31:50.60 It's definitely both.
00:31:50.60 --> 00:31:52.84 If you can't climb a rope, you're not making it through.
00:31:52.84 --> 00:31:54.04 It does matter how bad you go.
00:31:54.04 --> 00:31:55.04 I love it.
00:31:55.04 --> 00:31:57.64 If you've been put in the work, you're not going to be able to climb a rope.
00:31:57.64 --> 00:31:59.80 But yeah, you can get some Fitter Quitters.
00:31:59.80 --> 00:32:00.80 Exactly.
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:01.80 Exactly.
00:32:01.80 --> 00:32:04.80 Any average high school athlete physically can make it through.
00:32:04.80 --> 00:32:05.80 Totally agree.
00:32:05.80 --> 00:32:08.40 It's the obviously the mental part there that comes in.
00:32:08.40 --> 00:32:10.40 And you get guys that are an amazing shape.
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:13.16 Guys that were Olympic athletes or whatever it is.
00:32:13.16 --> 00:32:14.16 They quit right away.
00:32:14.16 --> 00:32:15.16 And I think a lot of that.
00:32:15.16 --> 00:32:20.96 Like the guy that killed himself maybe maybe hadn't faced adversity in the ways that
00:32:20.96 --> 00:32:24.32 you need to figure out how to actually overcome it and how to get knocked down and get
00:32:24.32 --> 00:32:26.20 moving forward.
00:32:26.20 --> 00:32:27.80 And you're going to get hurt.
00:32:27.80 --> 00:32:29.08 You're going to play hurt.
00:32:29.08 --> 00:32:30.80 And a lot of these guys are used to that.
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:32.84 They're used to being treated in a way.
00:32:32.84 --> 00:32:34.84 If they're hurt, they have someone's right there.
00:32:34.84 --> 00:32:35.84 Yeah.
00:32:35.84 --> 00:32:36.84 They're making sure that they're okay.
00:32:36.84 --> 00:32:38.88 And they're going to rehab and all that stuff.
00:32:38.88 --> 00:32:40.52 It's not like Lamborghini's.
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:42.56 They're going to the shop a lot.
00:32:42.56 --> 00:32:45.64 There's no one that really crushes bugs.
00:32:45.64 --> 00:32:48.20 I don't think that's just like, oh, yeah, everything was easy.
00:32:48.20 --> 00:32:49.64 Because there would be some really good athletes.
00:32:49.64 --> 00:32:54.04 And I did have some stud athletes in my honor man was a guy named Keith Camira who
00:32:54.04 --> 00:32:56.20 was just a beast.
00:32:56.20 --> 00:32:59.36 He just fast at everything and strong.
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:00.36 He was just a beast.
00:33:00.36 --> 00:33:03.88 And so I would say, I guess there are a few guys that crush bugs.
00:33:03.88 --> 00:33:07.88 But most people, they're going to have some, they're going to pick apart some weak points
00:33:07.88 --> 00:33:08.88 in you.
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:09.88 Yep.
00:33:09.88 --> 00:33:10.88 And that's what you want.
00:33:10.88 --> 00:33:11.88 I want to be tested.
00:33:11.88 --> 00:33:12.88 That was the whole, that was one of the main draws.
00:33:12.88 --> 00:33:14.92 Did you make it through first time every time?
00:33:14.92 --> 00:33:17.96 No, so I had after hell week, my fist lays weren't working.
00:33:17.96 --> 00:33:20.72 Whatever stress fractures, whatever it was.
00:33:20.72 --> 00:33:24.000 So they yanked me off the next swim because I was just, I don't know, sinking probably.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000 And said, you're going to medical.
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000 I'm pushing.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 No, I'm not going to medical.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 It's like a clean.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000 It's like a clean.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000 It's like a clean.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000 It was not a clean.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000 Exactly.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 I mean, they remember them pulling me out on the boat.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 They're going to medical now.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000 I was like, dang it.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000 So I went in there.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000 But it worked for me.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000 Whatever they did.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000 Like some people stood there at that time.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.92 Like you could have a guy there for like a year, just kind of hiding out.
00:33:43.92 --> 00:33:44.92 But for me, it worked.
00:33:44.92 --> 00:33:46.92 It just makes me a little rest.
00:33:46.92 --> 00:33:47.92 And then, fast up with the next class.
00:33:47.92 --> 00:33:48.92 The next class.
00:33:48.92 --> 00:33:49.92 Yeah.
00:33:49.92 --> 00:33:53.12 What was your attitude when you got rolled?
00:33:53.12 --> 00:33:54.36 Was it like the end of your life?
00:33:54.36 --> 00:33:55.36 Free like, oh my god.
00:33:55.36 --> 00:33:56.36 Or are you like, okay, cool.
00:33:56.36 --> 00:33:59.04 I mean, because I guess there's so many people get rolled back.
00:33:59.04 --> 00:34:00.04 Yeah.
00:34:00.04 --> 00:34:01.04 Yeah.
00:34:01.04 --> 00:34:03.04 I was a little bummed because I was friends with all these guys.
00:34:03.04 --> 00:34:06.32 They were going on a dive phase and you're like, you're watching them, going to
00:34:06.32 --> 00:34:07.32 dive phase.
00:34:07.32 --> 00:34:09.68 And you're like, but then a lot of them get rolled back for pull-com.
00:34:09.68 --> 00:34:11.68 And then you got half your class back again.
00:34:11.68 --> 00:34:12.68 So that was great.
00:34:12.68 --> 00:34:14.84 And pull-com was my favorite.
00:34:14.84 --> 00:34:15.84 Like that.
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:19.88 And drown proofing because that's the only time you get to get physical with an instructor.
00:34:19.88 --> 00:34:22.000 The other time, like you're just there, you're getting yelled at.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.40 You're being told your word was whatever.
00:34:24.40 --> 00:34:26.04 But this is the time where it's mono-emono.
00:34:26.04 --> 00:34:28.12 It's like you against them.
00:34:28.12 --> 00:34:29.92 And you know, it's a little bit physical.
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:30.92 So I love pull-com.
00:34:30.92 --> 00:34:33.32 Past first time, I was comfortable in the water.
00:34:33.32 --> 00:34:35.64 But then the drown proofing also, that's what you really get in physical.
00:34:35.64 --> 00:34:38.32 They have the different types of bodies that you have to say.
00:34:38.32 --> 00:34:39.32 You mean life-saving.
00:34:39.32 --> 00:34:40.32 Life-saving.
00:34:40.32 --> 00:34:41.32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:41.32 --> 00:34:42.32 That's true.
00:34:42.32 --> 00:34:43.32 So they have the guy to get on there.
00:34:43.32 --> 00:34:44.32 You know, just like dead weight.
00:34:44.32 --> 00:34:45.76 And then they went, that's fighting you.
00:34:45.76 --> 00:34:46.76 And that's the one I liked.
00:34:46.76 --> 00:34:47.76 That was awesome.
00:34:47.76 --> 00:34:48.76 And they dragged you to the bottom.
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:50.92 And I just feel like, and this is probably the martial arts stuff.
00:34:50.92 --> 00:34:52.56 It's just relax, because he's working.
00:34:52.56 --> 00:34:54.64 He's working to keep me down there at the bottom.
00:34:54.64 --> 00:34:56.96 And then when he comes up for air, then I just go a little more.
00:34:56.96 --> 00:34:59.32 And then he'd get his air, and he dragged me back down.
00:34:59.32 --> 00:35:00.64 But it was like us together.
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:02.20 Like, I love that part.
00:35:02.20 --> 00:35:03.20 That's my favorite part of my life.
00:35:03.20 --> 00:35:04.72 No one I figured out.
00:35:04.72 --> 00:35:07.84 I figured out what the choke-hold, right?
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:09.68 I figured out, like, okay, this is a choke.
00:35:09.68 --> 00:35:11.44 Like a rear-naked choke that I can use.
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:15.36 And the recovery is you, I think you put your arm over.
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:18.24 Like, almost the same, but you grab them, like, by the lat on the other side.
00:35:18.24 --> 00:35:20.88 And I just realized, oh, if I just put it on over here, it's going to choke.
00:35:20.88 --> 00:35:23.76 This dude is going to make him get under control.
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:25.12 And then, but I can go back to the position.
00:35:25.12 --> 00:35:26.40 But yeah, I had a good time with that.
00:35:26.40 --> 00:35:39.20 I failed pull-com because the former UDT guy from NOM who ended up working for me at Trade-at.
00:35:39.20 --> 00:35:43.04 And one day I asked him, I said, you remember failing me in pull-com?
00:35:43.04 --> 00:35:44.04 Because, oh, yeah.
00:35:44.04 --> 00:35:45.52 I was just messing with you.
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:46.52 I was like, oh, cool.
00:35:46.52 --> 00:35:47.52 Thanks.
00:35:47.52 --> 00:35:48.52 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:35:48.52 --> 00:35:49.52 Appreciate it.
00:35:49.52 --> 00:35:50.52 And then I passed the next time.
00:35:50.52 --> 00:35:51.52 But yeah.
00:35:51.52 --> 00:35:52.52 Yeah.
00:35:52.52 --> 00:35:55.60 Those water I was pretty comfortable in from surfing growing up.
00:35:55.60 --> 00:35:58.60 But for me, everything, I had to work hard.
00:35:58.60 --> 00:36:00.000 I had to run hard all that stuff.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 Oh, yeah.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000 That's the whole thing.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000 That's what it's all about.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.56 So you get done with Buds and where'd you get it going?
00:36:05.56 --> 00:36:06.96 Going team five.
00:36:06.96 --> 00:36:09.40 And back then, you're like, oh, it's going to happen.
00:36:09.40 --> 00:36:11.04 Oh, North Korea is going to happen.
00:36:11.04 --> 00:36:12.04 Yeah.
00:36:12.04 --> 00:36:13.52 So I've got to give you a reading stuff in the earth.
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:15.76 And still going to happen through the news.
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:19.64 So I went to team five, that was my first choice.
00:36:19.64 --> 00:36:21.16 And it's just because of that.
00:36:21.16 --> 00:36:23.48 So now it's 1997.
00:36:23.48 --> 00:36:24.48 Yeah.
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:25.48 Yeah.
00:36:25.48 --> 00:36:26.48 Yeah.
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:29.48 So I was still on the west coast at this time.
00:36:29.48 --> 00:36:30.68 I was over at Team One.
00:36:30.68 --> 00:36:31.68 Yep.
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:32.68 And I was I was in training.
00:36:32.68 --> 00:36:36.52 So probably got that was right around when I got picked up for a commissioning program.
00:36:36.52 --> 00:36:39.24 So I'm just trying to think time frame like all the guys that I know from Team
00:36:39.24 --> 00:36:40.24 Five were all there.
00:36:40.24 --> 00:36:41.24 Yeah.
00:36:41.24 --> 00:36:42.24 Well, it's cool 90s.
00:36:42.24 --> 00:36:43.24 Welcome in you aboard.
00:36:43.24 --> 00:36:44.24 Oh, yeah.
00:36:44.24 --> 00:36:45.24 Very great.
00:36:45.24 --> 00:36:46.24 Very gentle.
00:36:46.24 --> 00:36:47.24 Love it.
00:36:47.24 --> 00:36:48.24 And I loved it.
00:36:48.24 --> 00:36:50.56 We'd get there, of course, and get issued a pager.
00:36:50.56 --> 00:36:52.60 And then they'd give us all this awesome gear.
00:36:52.60 --> 00:36:54.36 And we'd be at the bar drinking.
00:36:54.36 --> 00:36:55.84 And I'll send that go off in the movies.
00:36:55.84 --> 00:36:56.60 And we'd fly off.
00:36:56.60 --> 00:37:00.04 And save the princess and get back in time for a beer's the next night.
00:37:00.04 --> 00:37:01.04 Yeah.
00:37:01.04 --> 00:37:04.64 And then I get there and it's like, hey, you guys clean that toilet.
00:37:04.64 --> 00:37:05.64 And paint that wall.
00:37:05.64 --> 00:37:07.04 Change those light bulbs.
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:08.84 And I was like, Roger that.
00:37:08.84 --> 00:37:09.84 Let's do it.
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:11.24 I'm going to be the best light bulb we've changed.
00:37:11.24 --> 00:37:13.44 And that you've got here.
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:14.84 So that was a little different.
00:37:14.84 --> 00:37:15.84 Little.
00:37:15.84 --> 00:37:17.44 Did you go through SQT at Group One?
00:37:17.44 --> 00:37:18.44 Did you go through it?
00:37:18.44 --> 00:37:19.44 Second time.
00:37:19.44 --> 00:37:21.44 Yeah, it was the second class at Group One.
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:22.44 OK.
00:37:22.44 --> 00:37:24.24 And yeah, so went through that one.
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:25.24 And it was good.
00:37:25.24 --> 00:37:27.000 It was professionalizing it, standardizing things.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.28 Obviously it's more professional now.
00:37:29.28 --> 00:37:30.64 But yeah, it was great time.
00:37:30.64 --> 00:37:31.64 Love that.
00:37:31.64 --> 00:37:32.64 Had a blast.
00:37:32.64 --> 00:37:35.44 And as you rolled into, if there was your position in your first turn, what
00:37:35.44 --> 00:37:36.44 do you do?
00:37:36.44 --> 00:37:39.24 I was the assistant calm guy.
00:37:39.24 --> 00:37:42.64 So for whatever reason they're like, college, you're going to calm school.
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:43.64 Oh, yeah.
00:37:43.64 --> 00:37:44.64 I want to be the point man.
00:37:44.64 --> 00:37:45.64 Exactly.
00:37:45.64 --> 00:37:46.64 You must be smart.
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:47.64 I want to be a point man.
00:37:47.64 --> 00:37:48.64 Yeah, of course.
00:37:48.64 --> 00:37:49.64 Yeah, read those books.
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:50.64 Right point man.
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:51.64 Of course.
00:37:51.64 --> 00:37:52.64 What patches Watson.
00:37:52.64 --> 00:37:53.64 And that's what you want to do.
00:37:53.64 --> 00:37:54.64 Washington, all those movies.
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:55.64 So when they told me how to be at calm guys, like, dang it.
00:37:55.64 --> 00:37:58.44 You know, that's the guy that, well, wanted to get shot first and all the Vietnamese
00:37:58.44 --> 00:37:59.44 right next to the old Asian McKinney.
00:37:59.44 --> 00:38:00.44 He's got the thing.
00:38:00.44 --> 00:38:01.44 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:01.44 --> 00:38:02.44 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:02.44 --> 00:38:04.44 They had 10 that sticking up in the jungle and over the grass.
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:05.44 And that's what they.
00:38:05.44 --> 00:38:06.44 So anyway, but I did that.
00:38:06.44 --> 00:38:09.24 It was actually a great experience being a calm guy because you're part of the planning
00:38:09.24 --> 00:38:10.24 process.
00:38:10.24 --> 00:38:12.24 And then you're learning the radio.
00:38:12.24 --> 00:38:13.24 Yeah, it was great.
00:38:13.24 --> 00:38:17.96 So it's going through that calm course and then bringing back the newest, when I really
00:38:17.96 --> 00:38:20.72 was radio, it was techniques, whatever it is, to the pool tune.
00:38:20.72 --> 00:38:25.12 So even though you have a primary calm guy, you kind of know what's going on after that.
00:38:25.12 --> 00:38:26.12 That's a good course.
00:38:26.12 --> 00:38:27.12 There wasn't any way.
00:38:27.12 --> 00:38:28.12 It was a long course.
00:38:28.12 --> 00:38:30.000 So it's good to be part of the planning process.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.84 So as for someone that was going to be an officer at some point, I got to experience
00:38:33.84 --> 00:38:34.84 the plan.
00:38:34.84 --> 00:38:35.84 Did you even have that in your brain?
00:38:35.84 --> 00:38:36.84 I knew it was an option.
00:38:36.84 --> 00:38:37.84 It was an option.
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:40.48 So it was either that or the other East Coast seal team.
00:38:40.48 --> 00:38:41.48 Yeah.
00:38:41.48 --> 00:38:43.20 And I wanted to do both of those.
00:38:43.20 --> 00:38:47.12 I thought, but I figured out, let's give this a, let's check it out.
00:38:47.12 --> 00:38:51.84 I'm brand new, figure this out and see if I'm going to be an officer one day or go to another
00:38:51.84 --> 00:38:55.64 seal team or move on and go to the central intelligence agency like all the people
00:38:55.64 --> 00:38:59.16 that read about and then watch the movies.
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:00.16 So and there's nothing going on.
00:39:00.16 --> 00:39:01.16 Right?
00:39:01.16 --> 00:39:02.16 There's nothing going on.
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:03.16 Yeah, it's nice.
00:39:03.16 --> 00:39:04.16 Yeah, exactly.
00:39:04.16 --> 00:39:05.16 And nothing happened.
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:08.20 And some ship boarding, like one put to into a ship boarding.
00:39:08.20 --> 00:39:09.20 Was it your put to?
00:39:09.20 --> 00:39:10.20 No.
00:39:10.20 --> 00:39:11.20 No.
00:39:11.20 --> 00:39:12.20 Because I did.
00:39:12.20 --> 00:39:13.20 I did a rat for September 11.
00:39:13.20 --> 00:39:14.20 This is before that.
00:39:14.20 --> 00:39:15.20 Yeah.
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:16.20 Yeah.
00:39:16.20 --> 00:39:17.20 Yeah.
00:39:17.20 --> 00:39:18.20 Yeah.
00:39:18.20 --> 00:39:19.20 September 11th.
00:39:19.20 --> 00:39:20.20 Doing ship boarding.
00:39:20.20 --> 00:39:23.20 It's like, you know, I was walking around like I was damn him.
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:28.20 You know, the like, whoever I was walking from like I was, you know, all the
00:39:28.20 --> 00:39:29.20 things.
00:39:29.20 --> 00:39:30.20 Yeah.
00:39:30.20 --> 00:39:33.20 So we had big combat experience like no, you're a loser.
00:39:33.20 --> 00:39:35.20 But back then, that's what you wanted to be doing.
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:36.20 No.
00:39:36.20 --> 00:39:37.20 And to be quite frank, we weren't walking around.
00:39:37.20 --> 00:39:40.40 But we were, I've been out completely stoked that we got to do something real.
00:39:40.40 --> 00:39:41.80 But I got to lock in the load by gun.
00:39:41.80 --> 00:39:42.80 That was cool.
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:43.80 And it was good.
00:39:43.80 --> 00:39:45.80 It was, you know, good enough.
00:39:45.80 --> 00:39:47.80 Because most guys didn't get do that.
00:39:47.80 --> 00:39:50.28 Most time you know, many guys were just going to implement.
00:39:50.28 --> 00:39:54.68 And they would train other, you know, foreign militaries on how to do stuff.
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:57.12 And that's cool build relationships with other countries.
00:39:57.12 --> 00:39:58.12 Cool.
00:39:58.12 --> 00:39:59.12 All that do some big exercises.
00:39:59.12 --> 00:40:00.12 Cool.
00:40:00.12 --> 00:40:04.40 But to actually lock in the load you're weapon and get you have a real load out was pretty
00:40:04.40 --> 00:40:07.68 was like a big step back down.
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:10.24 And it felt great for me.
00:40:10.24 --> 00:40:12.44 But this was, so this is 97.
00:40:12.44 --> 00:40:13.92 And where'd you go on the planet?
00:40:13.92 --> 00:40:14.92 So that was a fake om.
00:40:14.92 --> 00:40:17.56 So is it just, was it ship order?
00:40:17.56 --> 00:40:18.56 No, no, no, no.
00:40:18.56 --> 00:40:20.56 It was all the things you just talked about.
00:40:20.56 --> 00:40:22.56 Yeah, so you just train in South Korea.
00:40:22.56 --> 00:40:25.24 Different countries, travel, Australia, wherever else.
00:40:25.24 --> 00:40:27.64 So just then the normal paycom type thing.
00:40:27.64 --> 00:40:30.24 Well, pre September 11th with much going on.
00:40:30.24 --> 00:40:32.48 And then you come back from that deployment role right into another.
00:40:32.48 --> 00:40:33.72 Because that's what you guys do.
00:40:33.72 --> 00:40:35.04 They become one cruise wonder.
00:40:35.04 --> 00:40:36.84 You get promoted to one cruise wonder.
00:40:36.84 --> 00:40:37.84 Oh, yeah.
00:40:37.84 --> 00:40:38.84 Where are you the primary comms guy?
00:40:38.84 --> 00:40:39.84 Did you skate out of comms?
00:40:39.84 --> 00:40:41.88 Oh, no, how did you get any good schools in between?
00:40:41.88 --> 00:40:42.68 Yeah, which you get?
00:40:42.68 --> 00:40:43.68 Free fall sniper.
00:40:43.68 --> 00:40:44.68 Oh, yeah.
00:40:44.68 --> 00:40:46.16 Yeah, so trouble trouble.
00:40:46.16 --> 00:40:47.56 Yeah, so sniper is what I want.
00:40:47.56 --> 00:40:48.72 So you must have been squared away.
00:40:48.72 --> 00:40:50.20 Because they don't just give those schools away.
00:40:50.20 --> 00:40:51.20 I mean, I don't know.
00:40:51.20 --> 00:40:51.92 Yeah, it's my chief.
00:40:51.92 --> 00:40:53.64 But yeah, I did.
00:40:53.64 --> 00:40:55.64 I checked with them.
00:40:55.64 --> 00:40:57.12 He was a crazy man, that guy.
00:40:57.12 --> 00:41:00.24 But yeah, so right to sniper school, which is what I wanted.
00:41:00.24 --> 00:41:01.16 Which I always wanted to do.
00:41:01.16 --> 00:41:02.52 So got there.
00:41:02.52 --> 00:41:04.28 Did 73 days, I guess.
00:41:04.28 --> 00:41:07.40 And what, Collingo, or you get the Valley fever.
00:41:07.40 --> 00:41:08.72 And stuff going on.
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:10.40 So I passed.
00:41:10.40 --> 00:41:11.92 So I passed, but I didn't pass stocking.
00:41:11.92 --> 00:41:14.32 Or because I didn't grow up doing that sort of thing.
00:41:14.32 --> 00:41:15.92 So I was shooting.
00:41:15.92 --> 00:41:16.88 You know, that was good.
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:18.56 I grew up shooting.
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:20.96 So I didn't know problems there.
00:41:20.96 --> 00:41:22.96 Then the stocking was a shock to me.
00:41:22.96 --> 00:41:24.72 I didn't really understand what was going on.
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:25.72 I was crawling.
00:41:25.72 --> 00:41:26.72 People.
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:27.96 I was crawling for 1,000 visitors.
00:41:27.96 --> 00:41:28.96 You know, out to do this.
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:30.52 And you can just walk for most of that.
00:41:30.52 --> 00:41:31.76 You know, I didn't know that at the time.
00:41:31.76 --> 00:41:32.96 You know, those are what they didn't know.
00:41:32.96 --> 00:41:33.96 We were doing.
00:41:33.96 --> 00:41:36.48 We were just crawling in Nyland in the summer.
00:41:36.48 --> 00:41:37.48 Yeah.
00:41:37.48 --> 00:41:38.48 And then they did it again.
00:41:38.48 --> 00:41:39.48 And then knocked it out.
00:41:39.48 --> 00:41:42.24 Yeah, we just said Jason Gardner on the same thing.
00:41:42.24 --> 00:41:45.48 You know, he, he said, yeah, I'm a shot fine.
00:41:45.48 --> 00:41:46.88 But failed stocking.
00:41:46.88 --> 00:41:47.88 Hell no kidding.
00:41:47.88 --> 00:41:50.68 And then he came back on again and was talking about, well, he talked about some
00:41:50.68 --> 00:41:51.68 of the mistakes he made.
00:41:51.68 --> 00:41:53.24 And it was very similar to what you said.
00:41:53.24 --> 00:41:57.80 But they would tell him like, hey, figure out where you're trying to get to and actually
00:41:57.80 --> 00:41:59.80 analyze the situation before you start moving.
00:41:59.80 --> 00:42:03.24 And of course, when he was younger, he was just, oh, I'm just going to go.
00:42:03.24 --> 00:42:04.24 Yeah.
00:42:04.24 --> 00:42:05.24 And so he went.
00:42:05.24 --> 00:42:06.44 And he would make it in time where people would see him.
00:42:06.44 --> 00:42:08.32 So yeah, that stocking thing is no joke.
00:42:08.32 --> 00:42:10.16 But the second time was complete.
00:42:10.16 --> 00:42:11.16 I think I just relaxed.
00:42:11.16 --> 00:42:17.20 Did you go, did you go through it the second time when you go back for stocking?
00:42:17.20 --> 00:42:18.20 Right.
00:42:18.20 --> 00:42:20.000 Before I think we deployed, yeah, right before we deployed.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000 Yeah, right before we deployed.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 But they're in that same work.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000 Yeah.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000 Okay.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000 That's cool.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000 That's awesome.
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Yeah.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000 So right back.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000 But yeah, I think I just relaxed.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000 And I got there knocked them all out.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Oh, you have points for people who don't know.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000 Yeah.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.000 We build up points as you stock or whatever.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.36 So the last, I think, couple stocks.
00:42:33.36 --> 00:42:34.36 I'd already had on my points.
00:42:34.36 --> 00:42:36.36 So I'm trying to help other guys.
00:42:36.36 --> 00:42:37.36 Cool.
00:42:37.36 --> 00:42:38.36 You know, I've looking back.
00:42:38.36 --> 00:42:39.92 I'm like, should I really help these people?
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:40.92 Oh, sure.
00:42:40.92 --> 00:42:41.92 They have, you know, should I've gone back to my field?
00:42:41.92 --> 00:42:42.92 My buds thing.
00:42:42.92 --> 00:42:44.92 Like, but you're different.
00:42:44.92 --> 00:42:49.88 What's different to help them, like, by trying to distract the instructors or by finding
00:42:49.88 --> 00:42:53.76 that that OP, you have to crawl in with an a certain distance.
00:42:53.76 --> 00:42:54.76 Yeah.
00:42:54.76 --> 00:42:57.64 And then let them know, hey, you know, you're too far, you're too close.
00:42:57.64 --> 00:42:58.64 Risking.
00:42:58.64 --> 00:42:59.64 Yeah.
00:42:59.64 --> 00:43:00.64 Like, there it is.
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:01.64 So he didn't have to risk it.
00:43:01.64 --> 00:43:02.64 Oh, I did.
00:43:02.64 --> 00:43:03.64 That sort of thing.
00:43:03.64 --> 00:43:04.64 So should I have done that?
00:43:04.64 --> 00:43:05.64 Maybe not.
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:09.52 But anyway, but it gave me good practice too, because I got to push the limits then,
00:43:09.52 --> 00:43:12.56 which gave me a lot of confidence in what I was going to do later.
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:13.56 That's pretty awesome.
00:43:13.56 --> 00:43:18.20 And then I paid for myself to go to some urban sniper, of course, at Pendleton.
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:23.24 Some, you know, one of these kind of fly by night operations that was going on back then
00:43:23.24 --> 00:43:24.80 to teach people how to do whatever.
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:27.52 So I went to an urban sniper course that I paid for because I was curious.
00:43:27.52 --> 00:43:29.000 I didn't do that at the time.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000 It was an average school.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.20 So I got to learn about urban hides and all that sort of thing, which was pretty cool.
00:43:33.20 --> 00:43:34.20 Sweet, who's wrong?
00:43:34.20 --> 00:43:35.20 I forget the name of it.
00:43:35.20 --> 00:43:36.88 I think it had like, but like, who did that?
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:39.24 Or were they former, I think former Marine snipers, I think.
00:43:39.24 --> 00:43:41.24 That were how well-fused it, Pendleton, I guess, probably was.
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:42.48 Some connections there or something.
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:43.48 Exactly.
00:43:43.48 --> 00:43:44.48 Exactly.
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:51.000 So, and then freefall, too, and freefall, was a crazy one, because that was, I came back to the
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.80 team one day and I didn't get freefall right away at it's sniper school.
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:59.44 And then you should kind of like one of the other for a new guy coming back.
00:43:59.44 --> 00:44:04.84 So my friends went and I came back from, and this was the first time that they'd done
00:44:04.84 --> 00:44:08.56 the civilian deal with it, they were training.
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:09.56 Oh, okay.
00:44:09.56 --> 00:44:11.36 But to wherever that was.
00:44:11.36 --> 00:44:13.80 So, came back from lunch, it was like your back, and you're kind of, you have
00:44:13.80 --> 00:44:16.80 be able to go to schools, and it's, you know, so the people that they can leave or whatever
00:44:16.80 --> 00:44:18.44 got married.
00:44:18.44 --> 00:44:23.76 And so I came back and I see Andy Stomph, who you know, and he's got this look on his face.
00:44:23.76 --> 00:44:25.48 And I'm like, oh, that's weird.
00:44:25.48 --> 00:44:28.28 I parked my truck, and there's no gate guard at the time.
00:44:28.28 --> 00:44:30.88 He's drive on the base, remember that?
00:44:30.88 --> 00:44:34.72 And he told us, I don't know, our dear friends had burned in and died.
00:44:34.72 --> 00:44:36.92 Three fall, like in that first week.
00:44:36.92 --> 00:44:39.84 And then of course, what does the team do?
00:44:39.84 --> 00:44:43.56 After I night, yeah, I go to the family, we're dear friends, and do the whole, all that stuff.
00:44:43.56 --> 00:44:45.36 His first experience with that.
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:48.96 And so as a team do, oh, you're going to free fall.
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:49.96 Yeah.
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:53.96 Like a week later after the funeral, like, paying, okay, let's do it.
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:57.88 So yeah, what did the UMA not the civilian one, but went to UMA, stopped at Bragg
00:44:57.88 --> 00:45:01.48 first for the, for the air tunnel, if they, they did back then the wind tunnel.
00:45:01.48 --> 00:45:02.48 Oh, that's cool.
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:03.48 And then, uh, an on the UMA.
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:06.60 So did those before my, uh, my second upal tune.
00:45:06.60 --> 00:45:09.12 And then you go on your second, you go on your second deployment.
00:45:09.12 --> 00:45:10.12 Yep.
00:45:10.12 --> 00:45:11.28 Yeah, I went to do go on deployment.
00:45:11.28 --> 00:45:12.88 So a couple of weeks before September 11th.
00:45:12.88 --> 00:45:13.88 Oh, yep.
00:45:13.88 --> 00:45:17.80 So, uh, Guam, expecting a, uh, I don't like the first one.
00:45:17.80 --> 00:45:21.60 Just they were going to go train some people, finally get to go to Thailand.
00:45:21.60 --> 00:45:24.000 And yeah, two weeks into it, September 11th happen.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.32 People start banging on doors up and down.
00:45:26.32 --> 00:45:28.12 The barracks and we'd have TVs in our room.
00:45:28.12 --> 00:45:32.36 Then, so, uh, you know, phones are ringing, because it's midnight, I guess, in Guam.
00:45:32.36 --> 00:45:34.28 And, uh, you know, nine am on the east coast.
00:45:34.28 --> 00:45:38.20 And we all get up and go down to the basement of the barracks in Guam where we had one
00:45:38.20 --> 00:45:39.20 TV.
00:45:39.20 --> 00:45:41.76 And we all watched the, the Twin Towers, fallen TV.
00:45:41.76 --> 00:45:42.76 And I was the Intel guy too.
00:45:42.76 --> 00:45:44.08 So I was comms and Intel.
00:45:44.08 --> 00:45:45.08 Uh-huh.
00:45:45.08 --> 00:45:48.44 And so I've been reading, I just, you know, read, uh, what have been Laden book was,
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:51.28 but that were previous year, the man who declared war in America.
00:45:51.28 --> 00:45:52.60 I think it was cool.
00:45:52.60 --> 00:45:54.000 And so I was doing, I was always reading this stuff.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 I was always fascinated by it.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000 I was always reading about terrorism, insurgencies, and we're going to make myself the best
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.12 to see it like it possibly be.
00:45:59.12 --> 00:46:00.60 So I knew it all kind of meant.
00:46:00.60 --> 00:46:02.72 And I knew it meant the base.
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:04.28 And so I gave a brief right away.
00:46:04.28 --> 00:46:09.24 And nobody knew the number of the seal of Guam at no idea who all kind of was.
00:46:09.24 --> 00:46:13.68 And so I gave my brief and, you know, if he's up and studied it ever since.
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:16.68 But, um, that was, we thought we'd be on plans the next day.
00:46:16.68 --> 00:46:17.68 That's the song.
00:46:17.68 --> 00:46:18.68 Let's go.
00:46:18.68 --> 00:46:21.52 We start palatizing, getting ready, uh, but really took a couple weeks.
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:22.52 And then, then off we went.
00:46:22.52 --> 00:46:26.16 And that's when I did the ship boardings, um, because we took over a 14-3, who went into
00:46:26.16 --> 00:46:30.52 Afghanistan and we ended up taking their ship boarding mission, which actually looking back,
00:46:30.52 --> 00:46:33.64 was a good one because that's my only ship boarding experience.
00:46:33.64 --> 00:46:37.44 And it was interesting because it's like a cop pulling over, pulling over someone in the
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:38.44 middle of the night.
00:46:38.44 --> 00:46:39.44 You don't know what you're walking up on.
00:46:39.44 --> 00:46:40.44 You have no idea.
00:46:40.44 --> 00:46:44.60 Instead of a car, when a cop, this is a, uh, a class three tanker that's heading for
00:46:44.60 --> 00:46:47.56 Iranian waters and you have a certain amount of time to get on there, it turned it around.
00:46:47.56 --> 00:46:49.16 And, you know, it was an E5.
00:46:49.16 --> 00:46:53.80 I'm turning around to class three tankers using my GPS and a compass, you know, turning this
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:54.80 thing around.
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:55.80 It was so, it was pretty cool.
00:46:55.80 --> 00:46:56.80 Do it.
00:46:56.80 --> 00:47:00.08 And there's some good coordination that has to happen on those.
00:47:00.08 --> 00:47:05.08 So it's as a calm guy, you're, you're working a bunch of different networks and, yeah,
00:47:05.08 --> 00:47:07.80 then you're, you, did you end up, yeah, well, you just said it.
00:47:07.80 --> 00:47:10.44 You end up a lot of times being the person that knows how to work GPS because you're
00:47:10.44 --> 00:47:12.16 the calm guy, at least it used to be that way.
00:47:12.16 --> 00:47:13.16 Now everybody has all they know.
00:47:13.16 --> 00:47:15.04 Now everybody knows how to do it, put yeah.
00:47:15.04 --> 00:47:18.60 Actually, the map and compass, that's why I went, I later on, jumping ahead, I had
00:47:18.60 --> 00:47:19.60 to relearn map and compass.
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:23.68 Like I had so dependent on GPS and there was a book, I think it's called, uh, be expert
00:47:23.68 --> 00:47:24.68 with map and compass.
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:28.92 So when I took over the junior officer training course, before I got out, um, we had a really
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:32.000 good, uh, not course that we did.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000 And that's why we taught myself.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000 Yeah, that's why we taught myself.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.84 The map and compass, like so, so I was a calm guy.
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:41.64 And when we first started getting issued, this was in like 92, we first started getting
00:47:41.64 --> 00:47:42.64 issued the big GPS.
00:47:42.64 --> 00:47:45.84 So they were, they were like the size of a, and they were big.
00:47:45.84 --> 00:47:47.44 They were like the size of two shoe boxes.
00:47:47.44 --> 00:47:49.44 And remember, they were big.
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:54.24 The PSN8 with this big giant antenna that was like the size of my water bottle.
00:47:54.24 --> 00:47:58.24 But, but what was interesting is they say, okay, Jaco, you know, you gotta figure out how
00:47:58.24 --> 00:47:59.24 to work this thing.
00:47:59.24 --> 00:48:00.24 So I figured out how to work it.
00:48:00.24 --> 00:48:03.76 And then I said, well, all it does is tells us where we are.
00:48:03.76 --> 00:48:07.80 And they're like, yeah, and I said, if we have a map and compass, we're good.
00:48:07.80 --> 00:48:10.36 Like I know where we are on a map and compass for sure.
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:11.36 I'm like, I know.
00:48:11.36 --> 00:48:12.36 I'll let see it's different.
00:48:12.36 --> 00:48:14.16 You know, you want to get over the horizon.
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:18.64 But anyway, so it was kind of always surprising to me that it's so much easier.
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:23.76 If you do a good terrain study, you can just walk and you can look at your compass occasionally.
00:48:23.76 --> 00:48:25.20 And you know where you are.
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:29.24 Rather than constantly looking at a GPS and getting your night vision trashed from that
00:48:29.24 --> 00:48:32.24 or whatever, it just was a different transition.
00:48:32.24 --> 00:48:37.56 I mean, and then obviously, GPS has became so good that, yeah, I mean, they're pretty awesome.
00:48:37.56 --> 00:48:38.96 Everyone has long their watch.
00:48:38.96 --> 00:48:39.96 Yeah, they're pretty awesome now.
00:48:39.96 --> 00:48:43.96 But I did like the map and cup of stuff because I grew up doing it in the Sierra,
00:48:43.96 --> 00:48:45.72 I grew up back back in and doing that.
00:48:45.72 --> 00:48:49.000 But before I came after I called, I went to Alaska for three months and back back around
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000 up there to the National Latter Leadership School up there.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000 Once again, training.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000 Getting ready.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000 You were so ready, fellas.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000 I went to high school.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000 That's what I did.
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000 Yeah.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000 But that just goes, it doesn't matter.
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000 You know, it's all the metal part, doesn't matter.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000 How much you prepare, how little you prepare.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000 It's all if you want it.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 If you're average athlete and you want this thing, hey, just don't quit.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000 You'll learn along the way.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000 You'll get in better shape when you start running that sand.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000 Just don't quit.
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000 That's it.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000 We'll get you a good running tip.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000 So at what point did you put in for an officer package?
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000 So that's spring before the September 11th of the moment.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000 It was we had a let's say a chief that was interesting.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000 Leadership team I'd say that was interesting.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000 And you know, the E5 Mafia was not happy.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000 They were, and it was, there's one of those things like, hey, I can complain about it.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000 Like everybody else, or I can put it in this package and go and do it better than it was done for me.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 So that's what I did.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000 And you got picked up first time?
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Oh, you already had a college degree in on that.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.000 Yeah, so put in didn't put out my number there's I won't say who he is because I think he's an admiral now, but he was an exo at the time.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000 And he went for my interview and there's a Friday afternoon.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000 So Friday afternoon team five workout included a gig.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000 And so, you know, I didn't, I did the workout, but then I changed into my whites.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000 So now I mean my whites in the spring and those things are horrible.
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000 I hate those uniforms, but so I mean my whites get in them all perfect.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000 And I go in to do my interview with the exo at the time.
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000 And I don't know now. And he's got a beer in front of him and his PT stuff.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000 He's like, I just want you to know how this is going to go and if it's any indication that this beer should be an indication of how this interview is going to go.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000 And I was like, I love it. I was still, you know, don't know.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000 Yeah, of course.
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000 So it's very very, you know, the whole thing.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000 But yeah, of course, I did, I did at a good first couple of tunes as a new guy.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000 I would know what we're going on.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000 And so I got picked up the first time.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000 And then you went to OCS.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000 Oh, yeah, after I got back.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000 So, but of course, the temperal event happens and I'm like, dang it.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000 I'm going to be around choice.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000 Because I, if what you want to be is you want to be an listed guy.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000 You know, going to be in the fight for a while first anyway.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.000 Yeah.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000 So, but it ended up working out well because I got right back from that deployment.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000 Did, well, I did it a little training trip to a place and that was a great experience.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000 And then, it's classed up for OCS at in Pensacola,
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000 Pensacola and to the same things.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Yeah, I did that too.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000 It's awful to do the same things we didn't book and have full of the underwear, full of t-shirts, making our bed.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000 You know, all those things that somehow qualify you to lead me in combat.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000 And then right to the seal teams, right back to seal teams and ended up at a great team that's kind of right.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000 Well, so you know, I just come back from another East Coast seal team.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000 He spent almost a year deployed after September 11th and brought his lessons learned back.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000 And then he sent me to that team and right down range.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000 So, as a brand new officer, I was down range fairly quickly.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000 Timing wise, it worked out well for me.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000 That's beautiful.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000 Yeah, I got learned at, learned a ton on that deployment and then brought that back to my team and then deployed again right right away to Iraq.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000 So I got to get it.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000 Then you deployed as an assistant to the computer.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000 I was like a third one, a third one.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000 A third one.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000 A third one.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000 Yep, third one.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000 So you ended up doing a lot of the admin stuff and I used to load a lot.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000 But that's when, was an extra guy, essentially.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Yeah.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000 That's when the job happened.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000 So that's when I had probably the most, the most formative time in uniform was taking a sniper team into the job.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000 So it's, you know, pitch combat for, he was a two-week campaign.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000 So it was 11 days and it was one of the first times I think that that we really went to the conventional side and said, hey, how can we help?
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000 Yeah, we're supporting you in this campaign.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000 Here's what I'm bringing to the table.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000 These snipers, J-Tax, we can control aircraft for you.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000 We can pre-plan air.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000 And this is, this is what we can offer.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000 How can this augment?
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000 You how can this help?
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000 And I'm sure this happened before, but that was the first time that that I was involved in something like that.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000 And had a great relationship.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Colonel Rainy was the guy's name he must be a general now or retired.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000 Probably retired now.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000 But had a great relationship with him.
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000 And we just got after it for 11 days out there.
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000 It was great.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000 You had a lot of team guys that you out with there.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000 It's six, I think.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000 And then we had some Polish ground guys.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000 And then Marzok dep one because they were part of that deployment.
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000 With us it was the trial runner.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Yeah, no, I saw.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000 Those guys turned over with me in Baghdad.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000 Okay.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000 Because when you guys got to Baghdad from your team.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000 Yep.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000 You went to Mosul.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.000 Yep.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000 And I was down in Baghdad doing a turnover with the Marzok guys.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000 Which I knew a bunch of Marzok guys from the old days of doing shipboard deploy.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000 And they were bunch of awesome guys.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000 Awesome.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000 And then yeah, then I went home.
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000 And then I guess you came down to Baghdad right before I went home.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000 Take the PST thing.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000 Yeah.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000 Yeah.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000 And well, that was going on.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000 We're standing that thing up.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000 And I learned a ton there too because you're like,
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000 What are we doing?
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000 We're protecting the Inter Marquee government officials.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000 And we're not turning over with anybody because it hasn't been done before.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000 And the last guy before allow.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000 We just got blown up by an ID.
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000 Okay.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000 Let's do this.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000 Let's figure it out.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000 And so I mean, we were started with one computer.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000 And my CEO from team two.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000 And it was, I was at that computer.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Just like, he'd be talking to me, dictating things and putting together the mission.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000 And blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000 And I was just learning and, you know, chiming in where I could write that out.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000 So you knew there were PSD got stood up.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000 Yeah.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000 Yeah.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000 One computer and one small office.
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000 And then it grew into this huge monstrosity.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000 I should've actually became.
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000 But still learned a lot.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 Yeah.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000 But that also meant that I was an extra, extra dude as we kind of figured out what was going on.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000 And then I got to go up and help out with Marsoc.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000 That one because one of those guys had to go back and do something.
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000 So I got to go up and help them out for a little bit on the intel side of the house for a few weeks.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000 And then there was a lot of that.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000 That's when they're job kicked off.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000 And they're like, we need snipers.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000 And so there's grab snipers.
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000 And the most together.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000 Yes.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000 Awesome.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000 Awesome.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000 Yeah.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000 But I remember the CO team one.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000 So he was attached to that Marsoc thing.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000 So I was essentially working for team one at the time.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000 And I remember him distinctly calling me in because I was the, I was the old man I was taking
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000 these guys to do this thing that was kind of ambiguous.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000 We're taking over the city as part of a bigger campaign with two, seven cab.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000 And he said, hey, whatever you do, whatever this means, I don't really know what it meant.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000 I just nodded.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000 But he's like, whatever you do, don't go forward.
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000 A friendly lines.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000 And I was like, okay.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Like Roger that.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000 But I didn't mean.
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000 So hours of being on the ground, we are pushing forward, taking, pushing the enemy back, going
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000 up, getting high ground and calling in the Bradley's and A rooms and coordinating all that stuff.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000 So right away, I'm disobeying his order and getting the job done.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000 Because that's what it took.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000 But it was incredible to work with those guys and we, and it was a, a hot spot if people wasn't just
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000 two, seven cab.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000 It was Army National Guard units.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 It was air from everywhere.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000 All coming together, working together for the first time and making this thing happen and pushing the enemy back towards the Ema Molly Moss, which is one of the whole the sites in all of Islam.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000 And that 11th day, we had that place all of them in the Ema Molly Moss.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000 So we worked every day, we pushed forward a little bit and then go up, take the high ground, everybody come up.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000 We do that.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000 Maybe to be there for a day, though the water would come up.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000 That Army logistics train, which was moving and then we pushed forward again.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000 And it was incredible to be part of that and help out for we could.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000 But then, of course, we have where we want them and is a, you know, brand new guys want to vomit.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000 I want to drop a bomb on the Ema Molly Moss.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000 Looking back, you know, the probably not the right decision that we're not.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000 No, no.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000 And, but what are the other daughters in the whole tactical call, but not the best decision.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000 No, no, no, no, no.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000 Well, in hindsight and with what I've studied since, you know, bombing one of the,
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000 Holy of sites in all of Islam probably was not, but not of an outright move.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000 So that was that was denied.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000 But if I thought all of a sudden was in there, all of the body militia was in there.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000 And then they did some sort of a peace agreement, see the Irish thing or whatever.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000 And then we got to watch them all, leave and turn their weapons over to the Iraqi National Guard or somebody.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000 And that was the end of that.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000 So, and then we dealt with with every percussion for over a while.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000 But it was good tactical experience.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Yeah.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000 Because I got to come back and talk about having, you know, sniper weapon systems,
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000 but also being able to have a red dot on those things to clear the room,
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000 because we're clearing rooms and then using those same weapon systems to set up and do the job.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000 So, got to bring a lot of different ways to make the little put up with become loopholes or whatever.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000 And walls and, you know, all that sort of thing.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 So, got to bring back and share a lot of that experience.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000 How much longer was deployment once you got done with that?
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 I think like a month or so.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000 Okay.
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000 So it was kind of like, eh.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 Yeah.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000 Yeah.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000 You were just like, so stoked.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Yeah.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000 It was pretty good.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000 And yeah.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000 So it was a formative experience.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000 And then it was like, they called it, it wasn't the surge, but the seal teams we called it, the surge.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000 So we got to deploy a year later instead of a year and a half later, I was really held a man.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000 So I got to get right back after it.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000 So yeah, because you came home.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000 Yeah.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Now did you get pulled to the commander?
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000 Was it your position?
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000 So now I'm on your side.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 Second of the assistant.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000 Now you're the official assistant.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000 It's in my way up.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000 Yeah.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000 Second of the amount of charge.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000 Which is actually awesome.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 That's great.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.000 Yeah.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000 It was amazing.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000 Yeah.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000 You're super stoked.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000 You're like, well, I just had that awesome deployment.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000 And now I get to do another assistant between commander.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000 No matter.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000 No factor.
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000 And this time you got to do an actual workup.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000 Or you did a workup the first time, too.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Ish.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000 But I was that that third of, so that's what an admin stuff here and there.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.000 It wasn't quite the way it is today where you're only doing admin stuff as that kind of guy attached to the task unit head shed over the earth.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000 But essentially, I was doing a ton of the act.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000 But you're still doing all that.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000 You stood at the workup.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000 Yeah.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000 You still worked out.
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000 You still went to Mount.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000 You still went to Mount.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000 You still went to Mount.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000 You still went to Mount.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Not all of them.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000 Really.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.000 No.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000 Because I was like, head to my deployment with the other east coast team in there.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000 I came back and did a Haiti when that went down.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000 Because I was an extra guy.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000 So I got to go down there, which was pretty cool.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000 You make a good strap hanger, huh?
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000 You can get one of those guys that kind of like.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000 I didn't actually land like that.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000 I was always kind of like, man, I'm not in the, you know, I'm not in the A.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.000 I'm not an A.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000 You did a good deal.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000 They could be like, I've heard a run for his money.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000 They was, it was not a bad time to be just a dude hanging out.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000 They could grab it anytime.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000 And of course, I'm like, can you go?
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000 Yep.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.000 Yeah.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000 Of course.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Second go.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000 A sweet Emily, me in this afternoon.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000 Great.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000 So you, so now you're in your, now you're doing an actual workup.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000 You get to do all the training and then you go on deployment.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000 And you go back to Iraq again.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000 Yep.
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000 Yep.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000 And hit her body this time.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 Sweet.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000 So going into her mind.
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000 So now it's 0.5.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000 So five.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000 Yep.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000 Follow up 0.5.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Of course it changes throughout that workup.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000 You're on here, you're on there, whatever, but I forget it.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000 What time it turned to you are going to your body now.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000 But that's where you, that's where you wanted to be.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000 You know, five, oh, six.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000 And so we got to get in there.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000 And no, it was interesting because I forget if there was someone there before us or not.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000 I can't, I don't know why I can't remember if there was a turn of the
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000 must have been somebody there.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000 But I, I didn't stand out in my head anyway.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000 I think it was a much smaller depth before you got me.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000 Maybe.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000 Yeah.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000 And I wasn't part of that initial that first, my head shed goes over first.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000 The head shed went over and then I was the senior guy that came over with the rest of the guys.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000 So I didn't really do when I got when we got there.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000 Most of the world was gone and it was, it was just time to time to figure it out.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000 So we got to have a few cool things.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Like going out with the Marines, dressing up like a Marine, getting left behind to do this
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000 Napper's thoughts.
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000 You know, not exactly what you guys did because you guys really got after it.
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000 But, you know, baby steps.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000 Yeah, right on.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000 So it was, you know, going just going out with the Marines in the day.
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000 Yeah.
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Doing those patrols.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Where this, where the ID threat is high.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000 One of the most dangerous cities in the world at the time.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000 Like, that was legit.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000 Yeah, that's a, that's a get some evolution.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Yeah.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 I was just being on the base.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000 I mean, but the mortar's coming in, and I didn't,
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000 and I stayed, I didn't stay in that, that, whatever the,
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000 the build out the building, stayed out in the tents for the guys.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000 Yeah.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000 Yeah.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000 And yeah, there's nothing there to protect you from the mortar coming in.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000 Like, you just sleep in,
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000 and I'll let's let him a little bit of land on you.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Yeah, well on the receiving end.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000 And then during that deployment as well,
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000 you also went to Baghdad and work with an
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000 in-dage force there too.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000 Yeah, that's why I didn't see you in turnover.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000 Um, got to do this the second thing in my time
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000 in the military that was the most formative
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000 and yeah, I've got to do some stuff in Baghdad with a
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000 two other DAs basically.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000 Yep, yep.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000 Doing that with a, come over with a civilian type
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000 organization and, uh, yeah, with a little less,
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000 um, I guess oversight.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000 You'd say.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000 So I loved it.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000 I just did fit my personality and my, uh,
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000 my drive, I guess.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000 Like I was a perfect fit from yet that time.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000 Um, actually one of the things that happened during that
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000 time was the inspiration for the second book,
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000 one of the guys that I met there, one of the, uh,
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000 a racky that I was working with.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000 Um, but yeah, that was a, that was a great time.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000 Learned a ton, we're right there next to, um,
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000 guys from Great Britain, other army guys from there.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000 Uh, I guess premier special operations unit.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000 Um, so when we're doing stuff together,
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000 uh, and uh, you had a, you guys had a really good
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000 optempo if I remember correctly.
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000 It was a good time to be part of that.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:31.000 Yeah.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000 So I had a blast doing that, learn to ton, and I got to stay active.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000 Got to, got to, got to stay getting after it.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000 Not every night, but you know,
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000 Yeah.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000 Good, good optempo.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000 Cause it optempo.
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000 And then you wrap up that deployment,
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000 which again, these are, these are,
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000 you got some choice deployments.
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000 I mean, you could was, yeah.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000 Choice deployments.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000 It was a good time to, look to be in.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000 My timing was good there.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000 But then I get back. So now I've done, well, five deployments in a row.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000 And you're married?
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000 I'm married. Yeah.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000 I've got married after that first deployment.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000 So what's the kid count at this point?
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000 We are at one.
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000 Okay.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.000 One.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000 And then, uh, two for the next one and then three for the next one.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000 So what'd you do when you got home from that deployment to,
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000 with, with, when you got done with your assistant,
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000 Paltune commander tour.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000 So this is one of my good deal, train ants.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000 And, uh, I get back and I've done five deployments in a row.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000 Uh, if you count the endless did ones, three is an officer, all of them,
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000 get an after it, and they're like, you need to go somewhere
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000 and get some professional development.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000 Oh, yeah, they did.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000 It's like, like, wind your scam, but they put a whole ball that way.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:35.000 Yep.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000 And, uh, set my exo and, uh, was the ops had been the ops so in Germany.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000 So he's like you need to put a Germany.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000 And you need to do your thermo to unit does.
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000 Um, like, uh, unit two, what?
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000 Like, that's a place to be in 1944.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000 That's why I want to be, not in 2007.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000 And, uh, so I went kickin' in the screaming and I probably should have just said Roger that,
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000 you know, but, uh, you know, I've, uh, five deployments in a row, and those last three,
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000 being fairly intense, uh, I didn't want my guys to go back without me.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000 You know, I felt like, you know, I'm abandoning them to go to Germany and go,
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000 like, taste wine and look at, like, castle walls and these different towns, like, that, no.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000 Um, but you gotta go.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000 Um, but since I'd worked with that other government agency,
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000 um, I got, uh, kind of, I guess you'd say recruited by them.
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000 And while I'm waiting to go to Germany, I go up to DC and do my bunch of tests,
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000 then they put you through up there and, uh, get a class update to go to, uh, to that organization.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 And, uh, so I get to Germany.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000 I'm there for a few months.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000 It's horrible.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000 Um, I, uh, well, they think of a different language school first, because they thought I was going to go to North Africa West Africa.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000 How long is French language school?
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Six months.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000 I'm going to go to the six months.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Um, that was actually good.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000 But, whatever, good family time, all that stuff.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000 But I still wanted to be in a record.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000 I'm straight up D.O.I.
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000 And straight up D.O.I.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000 I'm on a, right?
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.000 You helped.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000 You know, yeah.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000 Luckily, I was at an off site, so I didn't have to go on pace, so that was,
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000 that was good.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000 So that was, I guess, I guess, another key.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000 I was keeping it good.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000 Yeah.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000 And of course, now I find out about CrossFit.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000 So I found it about CrossFit in her body.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000 So now I'm just crushing the CrossFit.
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000 And, uh, people think I'm insane, um, because no one really had seen that yet.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000 It was 2006, 2007, and they're like, what?
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000 Well, especially outside of the seal team, the outside of, you know, firefighters and all that stuff.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000 Just the regular gym.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000 They say you're doing all this swing and burbells around like their kettlebell or whatever.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000 Um, so I'm getting shaped.
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000 I'm training for my next, whatever deployment.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000 Trying to make myself better.
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000 Um, but we go to Germany.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000 Get there.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000 Hate it.
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000 Uh, a lot of people that were loving it.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000 And that made me hate it even more.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000 Um, and I probably should have just said, this is where the government needs me.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000 So I'm going to do the best I can along here.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000 And I did the best I could, but you're not doing anything.
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000 It was awful.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000 Um, I shouldn't say that.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000 It is a very important place to be.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000 And they have a mission.
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000 Yeah.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000 And that's great.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000 But it wasn't for me.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Um, so I dropped my papers to get out to go to that, uh, because I was wanting to get back to what I was doing.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000 Interact and bagged at 2006, getting it.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000 And, uh, so dropped my papers and, gonna go, just get out and go do that.
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000 And, uh, then a two weeks later they call me the seal call me back in.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000 So let's say there's a, uh, a, a, an OIC at Team 7 got out, there's a spot open deal on it.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000 And I was not expecting that at all.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000 And I said, Woah, my mind was already set.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000 I was I was essentially mentally out as out.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000 I was training.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000 I was getting ready for take to go back down right with this other group.
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000 And, uh, so when I'm talking about wife, she was breaking it again with number,
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000 second child.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000 And we decided to stay in them, like, okay, can get, uh, get back after do that leadership role.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000 role that I became an officer to have.
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.56 And we like team seven.
01:05:34.56 --> 01:05:36.000 And that's why I met you right now.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.24 So now I get my first taste of Jaco.
01:05:38.24 --> 01:05:42.60 And some finally some actual professional development
01:05:42.60 --> 01:05:43.44 that mattered.
01:05:43.44 --> 01:05:45.44 And it's up into that one.
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:46.48 It's baptism by fire.
01:05:46.48 --> 01:05:47.60 Like you show up at team two.
01:05:47.60 --> 01:05:48.80 Hey, you're going to Afghanistan.
01:05:48.80 --> 01:05:52.24 Oh, no training other than the T-shirt folding.
01:05:52.24 --> 01:05:55.000 And under were folding, it was yes.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.56 Luckily, I had some really good guys
01:05:56.56 --> 01:05:59.000 on those deployments that had already been
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.24 to Afghanistan that took me under their wing
01:06:01.24 --> 01:06:04.32 that showed me how these nods work.
01:06:04.32 --> 01:06:05.88 The point man only had them when you're last
01:06:05.88 --> 01:06:08.12 but two and the horse of Denver 11 tears.
01:06:08.12 --> 01:06:09.28 I used these things.
01:06:09.28 --> 01:06:11.44 Yeah, and that's kind of the way it used to be.
01:06:11.44 --> 01:06:14.24 It was OJT and the young junior officers
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:15.88 or even the young and listed guys,
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:18.48 you just get trained by the more experienced guys.
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:20.000 And that works great.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.92 If you're lucky enough to have a good experience guy
01:06:22.92 --> 01:06:25.28 that has the desire to teach you that really
01:06:25.28 --> 01:06:26.40 cares about the job,
01:06:26.40 --> 01:06:27.68 that wants to do a good job,
01:06:27.68 --> 01:06:30.08 that recognizes the importance of leadership.
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:31.80 And then it works fine.
01:06:31.80 --> 01:06:32.64 Yeah.
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:35.40 The problem is that it's not, it doesn't always work like that.
01:06:35.40 --> 01:06:36.40 So you get a guy that's a knuckle,
01:06:36.40 --> 01:06:37.68 you get a guy that doesn't care.
01:06:37.68 --> 01:06:39.32 You can just end up in a bad situation.
01:06:39.32 --> 01:06:42.64 And then some young kids were young,
01:06:42.64 --> 01:06:45.16 we're influential.
01:06:45.16 --> 01:06:46.48 What?
01:06:46.48 --> 01:06:50.32 Where we're very easily influenced.
01:06:50.32 --> 01:06:52.64 And we see how a bad leader acts.
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:54.60 And they tell us that that's how we're supposed to act.
01:06:54.60 --> 01:06:55.80 And we start acting that way.
01:06:55.80 --> 01:06:57.36 I've seen that happen many times.
01:06:57.36 --> 01:06:58.36 I'd meet a guy.
01:06:58.36 --> 01:07:02.000 I'd meet a guy that would be coming through my training.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.48 And he wouldn't quite be a good leader.
01:07:05.48 --> 01:07:07.32 And I'd say, let me just be talking to him.
01:07:07.32 --> 01:07:09.36 Oh, who was your Paltoon Chief when you were a new guy?
01:07:09.36 --> 01:07:11.16 And they'd name a guy and I'd say, OK, I see.
01:07:11.16 --> 01:07:15.04 Well, you could very easily find the root problems here.
01:07:15.04 --> 01:07:17.36 Or I'd get a young, oh, I get a Paltoon Commander.
01:07:17.36 --> 01:07:19.64 And I'd say, well, who was your Paltoon Commander when
01:07:19.64 --> 01:07:21.52 you were an AOC and they'd give a name?
01:07:21.52 --> 01:07:23.88 And the guy would be a bad leader.
01:07:23.88 --> 01:07:25.60 And he'd say, OK, well, I know where you got this from.
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:29.08 And they would give me the ability to actually steer
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:31.80 them in the right direction and say, hey, I wouldn't be
01:07:31.80 --> 01:07:33.76 offensive about their old boss or anything.
01:07:33.76 --> 01:07:35.32 But I'd start, like, saying, hey, there's
01:07:35.32 --> 01:07:36.88 another way to look at these things.
01:07:36.88 --> 01:07:39.000 So yeah, sure.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.36 That sounds like, but you got lucky.
01:07:40.36 --> 01:07:41.56 You had some good leadership.
01:07:41.56 --> 01:07:43.80 I mean, I know who your CEO was at team 2.
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:45.12 He's freaking out standing.
01:07:45.12 --> 01:07:47.36 And yeah, so you had some good, you know,
01:07:47.36 --> 01:07:48.72 you did some great mentorship.
01:07:48.72 --> 01:07:49.80 Yeah, he cared about it.
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:51.72 He cared about mentorship.
01:07:51.72 --> 01:07:53.44 And his, the senior guy, Steve brought with him
01:07:53.44 --> 01:07:54.64 from his other command.
01:07:54.64 --> 01:07:56.20 Also cared about those senior chiefs.
01:07:56.20 --> 01:07:59.000 They cared about what the next generation of both
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.68 and listed hand officers were going to do and how they
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:02.40 were going to lead.
01:08:02.40 --> 01:08:06.60 And so I was very fortunate to be the recipient of that
01:08:06.60 --> 01:08:09.12 mentorship and that guidance.
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:10.88 And that served me well.
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:14.52 And I had a good foundation anyway, but having that
01:08:14.52 --> 01:08:17.44 have somebody that cared that put a little structure.
01:08:17.44 --> 01:08:22.20 I mean, not, you know, a little structure behind it was
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:22.84 refreshing.
01:08:22.84 --> 01:08:25.60 And yeah, I just took all that on board and just,
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:28.48 you know, one of the best leader I could for my guys.
01:08:28.48 --> 01:08:29.44 But now it's team 7.
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:33.000 So that's, now it's, well, it was a good, it was a great
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.12 experience as an OIC.
01:08:34.12 --> 01:08:38.08 But most of that was due to the training that you brought.
01:08:38.08 --> 01:08:40.84 And so now I got to professionalize things a little bit,
01:08:40.84 --> 01:08:41.60 think about them.
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:43.52 And now my deployment, my good deal, train, I thought,
01:08:43.52 --> 01:08:44.88 ended.
01:08:44.88 --> 01:08:46.24 And for it, it's spiked a little bit.
01:08:46.24 --> 01:08:48.16 And we thought, oh, we're going back to Afghanistan.
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:49.72 Yes, and it's going to be you guys, because you
01:08:49.72 --> 01:08:53.04 know, it didn't end up being my opportunity.
01:08:53.04 --> 01:08:55.64 So I got to go to the PI, got to go to the Philippines.
01:08:55.64 --> 01:08:58.000 And first I'm like, yeah, that's a bummer.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.56 But you ended up being a great experience at an outstation.
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:04.80 Had more special forces guys, working for me,
01:09:04.80 --> 01:09:07.72 then I had seals working for me at multiple outstations
01:09:07.72 --> 01:09:10.24 that reported to me.
01:09:10.24 --> 01:09:13.72 And we were there to assist.
01:09:13.72 --> 01:09:15.16 This has been a wise type of thing.
01:09:15.16 --> 01:09:17.88 But it was with a Philippine Marine general.
01:09:17.88 --> 01:09:20.32 And I've also been down there fighting that in certainty
01:09:20.32 --> 01:09:22.80 in the Southern Island chain, since he was an instant
01:09:22.80 --> 01:09:25.72 or whatever they, you know, a second lieutenant.
01:09:25.72 --> 01:09:30.20 And I know, so I took the role of a student with him.
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:32.000 And amazing guy.
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.84 And just I really learned the area,
01:09:33.84 --> 01:09:35.000 learned what they were up against,
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.96 learned how the enemy was adapting to them,
01:09:37.96 --> 01:09:41.28 and how it changed over his 30 some years of doing that.
01:09:41.28 --> 01:09:42.12 And of course, he was mentored,
01:09:42.12 --> 01:09:43.92 because they've been doing that for over 100 or plus years,
01:09:43.92 --> 01:09:45.52 they've been fighting that thing.
01:09:45.52 --> 01:09:48.12 So he was a recipient of mentorship and lessons
01:09:48.12 --> 01:09:49.80 from the people that came before him.
01:09:49.80 --> 01:09:53.76 And I took that time, because I noticed that the SF guys,
01:09:53.76 --> 01:09:55.68 the Army SF guys, particularly the Warn Officer,
01:09:55.68 --> 01:09:56.60 that was there with me,
01:09:56.60 --> 01:09:59.32 knew a lot more about counterinsurgency than I did.
01:09:59.32 --> 01:10:01.04 Like I had the tactical kick in the door.
01:10:01.04 --> 01:10:02.44 I had that experience.
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:04.56 But I didn't have that broader piece yet.
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:07.96 And so I took that time in the Philippines to study
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.92 and read a ton.
01:10:09.92 --> 01:10:12.16 And who are the, who are the foremost experts
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:13.64 on counterinsurgency out there?
01:10:13.64 --> 01:10:14.16 Where are they?
01:10:14.16 --> 01:10:15.08 How are they going to touch with them?
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:16.40 Do they have anything I can read?
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:18.96 And so I just really schooled myself up.
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:21.20 And so it became a kind of a competition
01:10:21.20 --> 01:10:22.56 between me and him in discussions
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:24.04 about counterinsurgency's worldwide,
01:10:24.04 --> 01:10:25.40 but particularly where we are,
01:10:25.40 --> 01:10:27.64 but how that applies more broadly.
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:29.44 So I took it as a time to,
01:10:29.44 --> 01:10:31.24 and we did get to go to the VATE,
01:10:31.24 --> 01:10:32.80 got to do some things down there,
01:10:32.80 --> 01:10:37.80 the film rings, with us just helping with some more technical things.
01:10:37.80 --> 01:10:40.08 But they got to get after it.
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:42.80 And they lost guys, and we were there doing the MetaVac
01:10:42.80 --> 01:10:44.52 and doing all that sort of thing.
01:10:44.52 --> 01:10:47.08 You know, the body's lined up the whole deal.
01:10:47.08 --> 01:10:50.64 And it was, so it ended up being a very,
01:10:51.64 --> 01:10:55.000 I guess, another form of experience for me.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.32 And then I got to use what I learned about working with the army
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:01.56 once again, but in my next appointment as a troop commander,
01:11:01.56 --> 01:11:03.60 or once again, I had, and I went back to Iraq
01:11:03.60 --> 01:11:07.40 and I had more SF guys working under my command
01:11:07.40 --> 01:11:08.80 than I had sales.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.88 So it was good.
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:11.72 It was good run.
01:11:11.72 --> 01:11:13.48 So you went through that work up
01:11:13.48 --> 01:11:17.40 on your routine commander in 2008.
01:11:17.40 --> 01:11:18.24 Yep.
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:19.08 Cool.
01:11:19.08 --> 01:11:20.20 So I was pretty settled in,
01:11:20.20 --> 01:11:22.92 because I had come home in 2006 and 2007,
01:11:22.92 --> 01:11:24.32 I took over the training.
01:11:24.32 --> 01:11:26.44 So yeah, we were going hard.
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:27.28 Oh yeah.
01:11:27.28 --> 01:11:30.72 Oh yeah, yeah, my first experience heard all about this jacco guy.
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:31.56 Oh, why?
01:11:31.56 --> 01:11:32.64 Who is this guy?
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:37.000 And the first time you walked in to that room,
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.84 that briefing room at Fort Knox,
01:11:38.84 --> 01:11:41.28 the stadium seating, and they had the dynamic things
01:11:41.28 --> 01:11:43.04 up at the sand tables.
01:11:43.04 --> 01:11:46.08 And you came in and gave us this talk, and I was like,
01:11:46.08 --> 01:11:47.08 dang.
01:11:47.08 --> 01:11:49.64 Yeah, let's go get it.
01:11:49.64 --> 01:11:50.60 It was awesome.
01:11:50.60 --> 01:11:53.96 But I had one of my more formative experience
01:11:53.96 --> 01:11:58.56 in training in that particular urban warfare environment
01:11:58.56 --> 01:12:02.16 thing where you probably remember the scenario,
01:12:02.16 --> 01:12:04.96 because you probably did it for most of the platoon's
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:06.28 and troops coming through.
01:12:06.28 --> 01:12:07.40 But you have a mission.
01:12:07.40 --> 01:12:09.56 And you go out there and you're doing that mission.
01:12:09.56 --> 01:12:12.40 And I'm the ground force commander now, the GFC.
01:12:12.40 --> 01:12:16.48 And I'm there in my vehicle, and helicopter crashes,
01:12:16.48 --> 01:12:18.96 like a few buildings down, if you block down.
01:12:18.96 --> 01:12:21.52 And that comes over there with a radioing for help.
01:12:21.52 --> 01:12:22.64 For a couple blocks away.
01:12:22.64 --> 01:12:24.04 And we still have guys in the building.
01:12:24.04 --> 01:12:25.80 And our guys are taking contact in the building.
01:12:25.80 --> 01:12:27.76 And it's all set up whatever.
01:12:27.76 --> 01:12:30.40 And I'm hearing that, and I'm not going.
01:12:30.40 --> 01:12:32.68 I'm going to deal with this problem first,
01:12:32.68 --> 01:12:34.52 when it prioritizes an execute.
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:35.20 Yes.
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:36.76 But I wasn't quite doing that yet.
01:12:36.76 --> 01:12:38.20 I was like, I'm listening to the radio.
01:12:38.20 --> 01:12:40.16 And I'm hearing that a woman screaming
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:42.76 to helicopter pilot female screaming, like,
01:12:42.76 --> 01:12:44.52 they're surrounding us.
01:12:44.52 --> 01:12:45.88 What the whole thing.
01:12:45.88 --> 01:12:48.32 And like, what do I do?
01:12:48.32 --> 01:12:49.88 And I split my force.
01:12:49.88 --> 01:12:50.88 Oh, yeah.
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:52.36 I split my force.
01:12:52.36 --> 01:12:55.24 And so these two vehicles break in off.
01:12:55.24 --> 01:12:57.52 You're going to go to the crash site, secure the crash site.
01:12:57.52 --> 01:12:59.16 Well, then meet you at that crash site.
01:12:59.16 --> 01:13:00.92 And we'll actually help take another.
01:13:00.92 --> 01:13:01.92 So you know what happens next?
01:13:01.92 --> 01:13:02.76 Yes, I do.
01:13:02.76 --> 01:13:03.60 The saster.
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:04.84 The saster.
01:13:04.84 --> 01:13:05.68 Everything goes.
01:13:05.68 --> 01:13:07.52 And that was the point of the exercise.
01:13:07.52 --> 01:13:08.64 I think if you split your force,
01:13:08.64 --> 01:13:10.44 that, I don't know what happens every time.
01:13:10.44 --> 01:13:12.68 But in this case, it did.
01:13:12.68 --> 01:13:14.88 It was it to end up being a disaster.
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:15.48 We get out.
01:13:15.48 --> 01:13:16.48 We live guys behind.
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:17.92 If we go back in, the whole thing.
01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:19.04 It was great.
01:13:19.04 --> 01:13:19.88 It was great.
01:13:19.88 --> 01:13:22.04 But I've never seen it out with you afterward.
01:13:22.04 --> 01:13:23.48 And I really drove home.
01:13:23.48 --> 01:13:25.60 Yeah, prioritize and execute.
01:13:25.60 --> 01:13:29.64 And if you split your force, you better
01:13:29.64 --> 01:13:32.16 have a damn good reason to split that force.
01:13:32.16 --> 01:13:35.60 Just had a guy named John Strikermier on the podcast.
01:13:35.60 --> 01:13:37.48 The last podcast you couldn't have heard it yet,
01:13:37.48 --> 01:13:39.56 because it's not out yet.
01:13:39.56 --> 01:13:41.48 But he's selling a story.
01:13:41.48 --> 01:13:43.88 He's in Vietnam and this guy's just incredible.
01:13:43.88 --> 01:13:46.64 Sock, just the most insane stories ever.
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:48.08 And he's telling a story.
01:13:48.08 --> 01:13:50.24 And he goes, yeah, so I split my forces.
01:13:50.24 --> 01:13:52.24 And I put four guys on one side of the valley
01:13:52.24 --> 01:13:53.96 and four guys on the other side of the valley.
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:55.000 And we start moving it.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.80 And I had to find out.
01:13:56.80 --> 01:14:00.04 Because I mean, this is disturbing to me.
01:14:00.04 --> 01:14:04.20 And so I said, I was like, hey, explain to me,
01:14:04.20 --> 01:14:08.24 what made you decide to split your forces?
01:14:08.24 --> 01:14:09.44 I said, I never liked it.
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:11.60 He goes, I never, he goes, I split, no, this is what he said.
01:14:11.60 --> 01:14:14.60 He goes, I split my forces two times in Vietnam.
01:14:14.60 --> 01:14:15.84 Other than that, it's horrible.
01:14:15.84 --> 01:14:17.16 I do, because I didn't even like doing it here.
01:14:17.16 --> 01:14:18.48 I didn't have a choice.
01:14:18.48 --> 01:14:20.36 So that is a true statement.
01:14:20.36 --> 01:14:21.36 That is a true statement.
01:14:21.36 --> 01:14:23.52 If you can avoid splitting your forces,
01:14:23.52 --> 01:14:24.80 avoid splitting your forces.
01:14:24.80 --> 01:14:26.60 And if you have to, you better have a damn good plan.
01:14:26.60 --> 01:14:28.24 You better have a damn good reason.
01:14:28.24 --> 01:14:31.96 Because when then when you add enemy fire into it,
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:36.72 trying to link up forces friendly forces under enemy fire,
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:39.20 I believe that's the hardest thing to do in combat.
01:14:39.20 --> 01:14:40.80 I think that's the hardest thing to do in combat
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:45.20 is separate forces trying to link up with enemy contacts.
01:14:45.20 --> 01:14:46.64 Is it freaking nightmare?
01:14:46.64 --> 01:14:47.48 Yep.
01:14:47.48 --> 01:14:48.88 And so if you can avoid it, avoid it.
01:14:48.88 --> 01:14:49.48 Yep.
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:50.84 Have had to do that in Baghdad.
01:14:50.84 --> 01:14:55.28 Once with a QRF that we just talked to on the radio before
01:14:55.28 --> 01:14:58.40 and that was a little dicey, but yeah,
01:14:58.40 --> 01:15:00.48 the knots split in your forces for her ties and executing
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:03.24 never forget that experience.
01:15:03.24 --> 01:15:04.76 And luckily up until that point,
01:15:04.76 --> 01:15:07.96 I hadn't been in a situation where I had to do it down range.
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:10.96 Because I probably would have done it.
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:14.56 But after that training, I was like, I would think,
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:15.72 I think long and hard.
01:15:15.72 --> 01:15:16.72 Yeah.
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:17.56 Maybe not long hard.
01:15:17.56 --> 01:15:18.40 I would think it through.
01:15:18.40 --> 01:15:20.60 I think it through before doing that.
01:15:20.60 --> 01:15:22.28 So yeah, tough move to make.
01:15:22.28 --> 01:15:23.72 Yeah, that was great.
01:15:23.72 --> 01:15:24.96 For me, coming back from the body,
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:28.60 I was like super paranoid about stuff
01:15:28.60 --> 01:15:32.12 and really into the fact that I wanted people
01:15:32.12 --> 01:15:36.32 to not make dumb mistakes that I made or that I could have made
01:15:36.32 --> 01:15:37.32 or that I saw that people make.
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:41.44 Like, so I was pretty adamant to make sure
01:15:41.44 --> 01:15:42.84 that guys were learning lessons.
01:15:42.84 --> 01:15:44.16 Oh yeah, no, it was amazing.
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:45.16 I was training was great.
01:15:45.16 --> 01:15:47.12 And then we went to New Island, of course,
01:15:47.12 --> 01:15:48.32 into the Land of Warfare thing.
01:15:48.32 --> 01:15:52.04 And I was very comfortable with that because at Team,
01:15:52.04 --> 01:15:54.68 on the East Coast, we done that IMT,
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:57.76 individual movement technique, the earlier on, I guess,
01:15:57.76 --> 01:15:58.60 maybe the West Coast.
01:15:58.60 --> 01:16:01.000 So I had done it a couple times already.
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.56 So some of my junior officers that had never done it before
01:16:04.56 --> 01:16:05.80 and they were like, what are we doing?
01:16:05.80 --> 01:16:06.64 What?
01:16:06.64 --> 01:16:09.44 It's not just online and just the old school.
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:11.48 So they didn't quite get it.
01:16:11.48 --> 01:16:13.56 But I was, as a student commander, I was very comfortable
01:16:13.56 --> 01:16:14.28 with that at Nile.
01:16:14.28 --> 01:16:17.52 And so it was, yeah, obviously amazing training,
01:16:17.52 --> 01:16:19.64 especially with the technology that came along
01:16:19.64 --> 01:16:20.48 at the time.
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:23.28 There was no hiding from any mistakes
01:16:23.28 --> 01:16:24.20 that you might have made out there.
01:16:24.20 --> 01:16:26.20 You got the GPS on you and you go back
01:16:26.20 --> 01:16:27.04 and you debrief it.
01:16:27.04 --> 01:16:28.72 And then out of that old school 90s, like,
01:16:28.72 --> 01:16:29.56 no, that wasn't me.
01:16:29.56 --> 01:16:30.56 I think it was someone's over there.
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:32.28 I would never do something like that.
01:16:32.28 --> 01:16:33.12 Oh no, here it is.
01:16:33.12 --> 01:16:35.08 Here's your number, whatever it was on there.
01:16:35.08 --> 01:16:37.000 And you can watch it all in the debrief.
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.40 You can watch your little, watch your little,
01:16:39.40 --> 01:16:41.84 your little, what's that, what's that tank on?
01:16:41.84 --> 01:16:44.64 Your little icon on the ground on the field.
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:47.56 And watch your little icon engage your own forces.
01:16:47.56 --> 01:16:48.56 Yeah, oh yeah.
01:16:48.56 --> 01:16:50.08 You can watch that over and over again.
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:50.76 Right.
01:16:50.76 --> 01:16:52.12 Yep, no, exactly.
01:16:52.12 --> 01:16:53.56 And then going through the second time,
01:16:53.56 --> 01:16:55.76 things evolve and change and all that.
01:16:55.76 --> 01:16:58.28 But going through the second time is a troop commander
01:16:58.28 --> 01:17:00.20 then I was even more comfortable with it.
01:17:00.20 --> 01:17:02.08 Particularly in those those situations,
01:17:02.08 --> 01:17:04.52 I need the lessons we wanted to get out of there.
01:17:04.52 --> 01:17:06.08 And then I could do it a little better,
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:07.28 even then when I was aatoon commander
01:17:07.28 --> 01:17:08.84 because I already learned some of those
01:17:08.84 --> 01:17:10.32 in those particular scenarios.
01:17:10.32 --> 01:17:12.52 But yeah, that was an amazing training.
01:17:12.52 --> 01:17:16.000 And there's no question the impact
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.60 that has had on the field teams
01:17:17.60 --> 01:17:19.68 for the positive way.
01:17:19.68 --> 01:17:21.12 Kared some downmen, did you?
01:17:21.12 --> 01:17:22.76 That was awesome.
01:17:22.76 --> 01:17:23.92 That was awesome.
01:17:23.92 --> 01:17:24.76 Yeah.
01:17:24.76 --> 01:17:26.56 Everybody went down and every time.
01:17:26.56 --> 01:17:27.56 Yeah, yeah.
01:17:27.56 --> 01:17:29.12 It was a lot of downmen drills.
01:17:29.12 --> 01:17:30.96 Yeah, I was a lot of,
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:33.64 I mean, especially, and then what was cool for me
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:34.92 and people always remember that.
01:17:34.92 --> 01:17:37.20 But, but, well, they talked to me about it.
01:17:37.20 --> 01:17:40.28 And sometimes even then, you know, this is too much, you know.
01:17:40.28 --> 01:17:42.84 And the fact of the matter is,
01:17:42.84 --> 01:17:46.80 if your leadership did a good job inside of a task unit
01:17:46.80 --> 01:17:49.56 or inside of a troop, if the leadership did a good job
01:17:49.56 --> 01:17:51.52 and the U.S. decentralized command
01:17:51.52 --> 01:17:53.72 and the fire team leaders got up and made things happen.
01:17:53.72 --> 01:17:54.56 And they kept things up.
01:17:54.56 --> 01:17:56.28 Like if they did those things,
01:17:56.28 --> 01:18:01.12 the trade-out guys, the trade-out cadre couldn't take.
01:18:01.12 --> 01:18:02.64 They couldn't put a bunch of people down
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:04.28 because they would get their asses kicked
01:18:04.28 --> 01:18:06.72 by the troop, the troop would crush them.
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:09.16 And, you know, that one usually not happen early on
01:18:09.16 --> 01:18:10.96 because they would have to figure this out.
01:18:10.96 --> 01:18:13.20 But once they got good at it, like the trade-out guys
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:14.76 would say, you know, they'd be calling up
01:18:14.76 --> 01:18:16.68 myself or the, or the mastery of run it
01:18:16.68 --> 01:18:18.04 and be like, hey, can you bring me back to life?
01:18:18.04 --> 01:18:19.04 Can you bring me back to life?
01:18:19.04 --> 01:18:21.80 And be like, no, man, you, you know, you got killed.
01:18:21.80 --> 01:18:23.20 Of course, sometimes we would bring him back to life
01:18:23.20 --> 01:18:24.92 to press up to an harder, of course.
01:18:24.92 --> 01:18:27.36 I'm not gonna claim that we didn't do that.
01:18:27.36 --> 01:18:30.40 Cause Dale, we're gonna put the pressure.
01:18:30.40 --> 01:18:31.24 Yeah.
01:18:31.24 --> 01:18:33.08 But, that's amazing.
01:18:33.08 --> 01:18:35.72 The down mandrels, yeah, I get you, get you in shape.
01:18:35.72 --> 01:18:38.12 And then, but then it gets people pissed off.
01:18:38.12 --> 01:18:39.88 Like I came back to life and your pissed thing
01:18:39.88 --> 01:18:40.88 not making a decision.
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:43.04 So, and we don't, and the other thing,
01:18:43.04 --> 01:18:45.12 it's that you taught me and I passed on
01:18:45.12 --> 01:18:46.72 and it's, I still think about today
01:18:46.72 --> 01:18:47.84 and it's, like, it's in the book.
01:18:48.84 --> 01:18:52.44 Take a breath, look around, make a call.
01:18:52.44 --> 01:18:54.32 It's easy as that.
01:18:54.32 --> 01:18:55.88 That's, I think about that a lot.
01:18:55.88 --> 01:18:58.08 I gotta do, sit back, get off my gun.
01:18:58.08 --> 01:18:59.92 Look around, what's going on,
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:01.68 what's the satiactical situation?
01:19:01.68 --> 01:19:02.52 And make a call.
01:19:02.52 --> 01:19:03.36 Yeah.
01:19:03.36 --> 01:19:04.20 That's it.
01:19:04.20 --> 01:19:07.56 So simple, so not easy.
01:19:07.56 --> 01:19:10.12 So not easy, like, what it's cool
01:19:10.12 --> 01:19:11.92 and someone like, like, for someone like yourself
01:19:11.92 --> 01:19:13.64 that's a sniper that likes to shoot
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:14.68 and now it's under your task,
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:16.04 you know, commander, it's really easy
01:19:16.04 --> 01:19:18.52 to get to go right back to what you're super comfortable with
01:19:18.52 --> 01:19:19.88 which is, hey, I'll just get on my gun
01:19:19.88 --> 01:19:21.24 and start killing bad guys.
01:19:21.24 --> 01:19:23.20 But you got 40 other guys that are doing that.
01:19:23.20 --> 01:19:24.04 Yep.
01:19:24.04 --> 01:19:25.44 And none of those 40 guys are actually making a decision
01:19:25.44 --> 01:19:27.20 about where you're gonna go next to save everyone.
01:19:27.20 --> 01:19:28.84 So you're the guy that has to do it.
01:19:28.84 --> 01:19:30.96 So that's a good one.
01:19:30.96 --> 01:19:32.12 Yep, for sure.
01:19:32.12 --> 01:19:33.000 When I look back at old pictures,
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.20 I see how my loadout changed over the years.
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:39.16 And now, five times, I was a true commander.
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:40.60 You know, I'm a lot lighter.
01:19:40.60 --> 01:19:41.60 Well, I've been radios now.
01:19:41.60 --> 01:19:43.60 Two of them, you're carrying radis.
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:45.32 And then I got my mags on my cat.
01:19:45.32 --> 01:19:47.52 Only three in one of the gun or whatever it was.
01:19:47.52 --> 01:19:48.64 But there's a reason for that.
01:19:48.64 --> 01:19:50.80 It's because that, my job is not a control of this element
01:19:50.80 --> 01:19:53.24 and crush the enemy, not to be on the trigger.
01:19:53.24 --> 01:19:55.80 And then what was your, what was that deployment?
01:19:55.80 --> 01:19:56.80 Like where'd you go as a two?
01:19:56.80 --> 01:19:58.96 So that was interesting because it was the,
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:00.84 it was the withdrawal from Iraq.
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:01.68 Oh, okay.
01:20:01.68 --> 01:20:03.76 So we're there six months.
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:07.20 But it was, cause we didn't know if we were staying,
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:08.72 if we were going, if we were staying,
01:20:08.72 --> 01:20:12.84 or our authorities were gonna be where we were gonna be based.
01:20:12.84 --> 01:20:14.96 There was a lot of questions.
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:17.48 So we had to prepare about to stay long-term
01:20:17.48 --> 01:20:20.000 and to get up back and come home,
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.12 which is what ended up happening.
01:20:22.12 --> 01:20:24.52 So I think we got, they made us our element actually
01:20:24.52 --> 01:20:26.12 in an up going, they had to leave in at the end of November,
01:20:26.12 --> 01:20:27.72 I guess, there was another month there.
01:20:27.72 --> 01:20:32.16 But it was getting, they packed it up in the go home, essentially.
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:33.64 But you're working with partner force
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:37.16 and you're using your technical intelligence
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:40.52 to try to prosecute targets so that this,
01:20:40.52 --> 01:20:42.04 it wasn't gonna come a high way of death
01:20:42.04 --> 01:20:44.28 on the way out of there as the enemy just sets.
01:20:44.28 --> 01:20:45.68 Did you drive out of there?
01:20:45.68 --> 01:20:46.52 No, we flew.
01:20:46.52 --> 01:20:47.36 You guys for real.
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:50.04 I was, they drove out pretty peacefully too.
01:20:50.04 --> 01:20:52.04 Not a big massive convo, I don't see you later.
01:20:52.04 --> 01:20:55.32 Exactly, there's not, now we expected.
01:20:55.32 --> 01:20:56.88 So, but it's cool for a little bit,
01:20:56.88 --> 01:21:00.24 cause you got, I think they got a little more liberal
01:21:00.24 --> 01:21:02.000 with some of the targets there for a while,
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.64 when they're like, okay, we don't with this highway death,
01:21:03.64 --> 01:21:06.08 that's not gonna be on me because I denied.
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:08.52 I didn't wanna let a unit of lateral up go
01:21:08.52 --> 01:21:10.56 when we're leaving anyway.
01:21:10.56 --> 01:21:13.80 So, for a little, we got to do a couple of things,
01:21:13.80 --> 01:21:17.96 but mostly it was a leadership challenge
01:21:17.96 --> 01:21:20.48 to keep the guys focused on their mission.
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:22.68 At the same time, getting ready to go home
01:21:22.68 --> 01:21:24.04 for almost the entire deployment.
01:21:24.04 --> 01:21:24.88 So it was an interesting time.
01:21:24.88 --> 01:21:26.28 That was Bazaar, Southern Rhapsody,
01:21:26.28 --> 01:21:27.20 and then down there before,
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:28.88 the brits had been there first, of course,
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:32.52 a totally different terrain than anything I had dealt with before.
01:21:32.52 --> 01:21:33.84 And it was good.
01:21:33.84 --> 01:21:37.16 It was an interesting deployment at a great senior chief
01:21:37.16 --> 01:21:39.88 and who's still in, who's still in crushing it.
01:21:39.88 --> 01:21:43.44 And yeah, came home, that was the last time I'd ever
01:21:43.44 --> 01:21:45.08 tactically lead guys in the battlefield.
01:21:45.08 --> 01:21:47.48 And I knew that, and it pretty much as soon as we were
01:21:47.48 --> 01:21:51.08 airborne on the way home, like, getting out.
01:21:51.08 --> 01:21:52.52 So that was it, I don't know.
01:21:52.52 --> 01:21:53.92 How many years were you out of that point?
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:55.28 I think I was at 16 right there.
01:21:55.28 --> 01:21:57.64 And what was your family situation at this time?
01:21:57.64 --> 01:22:02.12 So three kids and right, if you're during the second workout.
01:22:02.12 --> 01:22:05.72 So in my OIC, work up the one where I met you
01:22:05.72 --> 01:22:07.36 and then went to the Philippines.
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:09.20 That's in our middle child with born.
01:22:09.20 --> 01:22:11.76 And we found out, I think it was at the,
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:14.20 one, to check up that something wasn't quite right.
01:22:14.20 --> 01:22:18.04 And he ended up, well, I'll get to where he has,
01:22:18.04 --> 01:22:19.36 but we couldn't know what was going on.
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:21.000 It wasn't eating.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.32 Wasn't meal milestones.
01:22:22.32 --> 01:22:24.28 There was something off in my wife knew right away.
01:22:24.28 --> 01:22:27.000 But it was just like, I just took a gatorly when he's hungry.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.84 That sort of thing.
01:22:28.84 --> 01:22:30.68 And we didn't know what was happening.
01:22:30.68 --> 01:22:33.28 So all during that second, or that deployment,
01:22:33.28 --> 01:22:34.92 they put me in that exceptional family member
01:22:34.92 --> 01:22:37.20 of category five because there was, you know,
01:22:37.20 --> 01:22:38.60 pretty severely disabled.
01:22:38.60 --> 01:22:42.28 And which means that you're not going anywhere outside
01:22:42.28 --> 01:22:45.08 of your current medical situation for your family.
01:22:45.08 --> 01:22:47.24 So it essentially takes the decision
01:22:47.24 --> 01:22:49.52 out of the service members hands, which is a good thing.
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:51.20 Meaning you're going to stay.
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:52.20 You were in San Diego.
01:22:52.20 --> 01:22:54.76 So that exceptional service member thing says,
01:22:54.76 --> 01:22:56.80 OK, we got to take care of this guy.
01:22:56.80 --> 01:22:58.20 Well, he's going to stay in San Diego.
01:22:58.20 --> 01:23:00.16 Yeah, so that's a different level to it.
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:02.20 But I was just going to do that during your second
01:23:02.20 --> 01:23:04.36 during your OIC tour or during your two career tour.
01:23:04.36 --> 01:23:05.64 I think you in the two commander tour.
01:23:05.64 --> 01:23:07.76 The first, we're still trying to figure out what was going on
01:23:07.76 --> 01:23:10.44 during that first one and nobody knew what was going on with them.
01:23:10.44 --> 01:23:13.20 So it's a lot of doctor visits, all that sort of thing.
01:23:13.20 --> 01:23:16.60 But my wife did it all because, as you know, when you're in,
01:23:16.60 --> 01:23:18.36 that pendulum has to be on the team.
01:23:18.36 --> 01:23:20.04 That's your responsibility as a leader.
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:21.60 You owe it to the mission.
01:23:21.60 --> 01:23:22.44 You owe it to the guys.
01:23:22.44 --> 01:23:23.40 You owe it to their families.
01:23:23.40 --> 01:23:24.16 You owe it to the country.
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:27.48 Ultimately, to have that be your sole focus.
01:23:27.48 --> 01:23:29.76 And that's out what the pendulum is over there.
01:23:29.76 --> 01:23:32.76 And my wife got that.
01:23:32.76 --> 01:23:35.64 That's what you do as a leader, obviously.
01:23:35.64 --> 01:23:37.72 So when I got back, well,
01:23:37.72 --> 01:23:39.36 yeah, when I got back, we still don't know.
01:23:39.36 --> 01:23:41.72 So now I've done two workouts with this situation,
01:23:41.72 --> 01:23:43.28 two deployments with this situation.
01:23:43.28 --> 01:23:46.92 My wife handled it the whole time, super strong.
01:23:46.92 --> 01:23:49.72 Get back and I go to Buds as the opposite.
01:23:49.72 --> 01:23:51.84 So now I get to see people ring the bell outside that office
01:23:51.84 --> 01:23:54.24 and put the helmet down.
01:23:54.24 --> 01:23:55.60 But in my head, I know I'm done.
01:23:55.60 --> 01:23:58.08 And I didn't make a, I didn't hide it.
01:23:58.08 --> 01:23:59.68 A lot of guys will hide it if they're planning on getting out.
01:23:59.68 --> 01:24:01.72 They won't say anything to anybody in the chain of command
01:24:01.72 --> 01:24:04.08 because they might stay in or whatever it is.
01:24:04.08 --> 01:24:05.28 But I'm like, yep, getting out.
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:06.08 That's 20.
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:08.40 And they're like, no, you're going to be an ex, not a 20.
01:24:08.40 --> 01:24:12.56 And it kind of surprised people when I'd say that.
01:24:12.56 --> 01:24:13.68 Buds is a machine.
01:24:13.68 --> 01:24:14.72 That thing is running.
01:24:14.72 --> 01:24:18.84 And as an opso, it's fairly, I don't know.
01:24:18.84 --> 01:24:20.04 It's not as dynamic.
01:24:20.04 --> 01:24:22.64 Let's say it as a shield team.
01:24:22.64 --> 01:24:26.88 And it's during that, well, a little after that,
01:24:26.88 --> 01:24:30.08 that someone told Ross Perot, our story, the Ross Perot
01:24:30.08 --> 01:24:31.68 and in Texas, the guy.
01:24:31.68 --> 01:24:33.48 And so about your son.
01:24:33.48 --> 01:24:34.88 Yeah, about our son.
01:24:34.88 --> 01:24:36.68 Because you still didn't know what was going on.
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:37.72 All right, so this is 60 years.
01:24:37.72 --> 01:24:39.28 There's a bunch of different hospitals.
01:24:39.28 --> 01:24:40.68 96 years old.
01:24:40.68 --> 01:24:42.000 They have no idea what's happened.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.96 And all sorts of different diagnosis,
01:24:44.96 --> 01:24:47.16 it's paid for Cedar Sinai going up there
01:24:47.16 --> 01:24:50.72 with the foremost experts to an oxygen my wife
01:24:50.72 --> 01:24:52.88 would take him to an oxygen tank 30 days,
01:24:52.88 --> 01:24:55.28 two hours a day or whatever it was that we paid for,
01:24:55.28 --> 01:24:58.32 just to see if anything would help.
01:24:58.32 --> 01:24:59.88 Someone tells Ross Perot story.
01:24:59.88 --> 01:25:04.84 And this is December of 2013, I want to say.
01:25:04.84 --> 01:25:09.84 And I get a call out of the blue from Ross Perot,
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:11.80 who sounds exactly like Dana Carvey,
01:25:11.80 --> 01:25:14.16 impersonating Ross Perot in the 90s.
01:25:14.16 --> 01:25:16.80 And like what is going on?
01:25:16.80 --> 01:25:19.72 And he's like, I'm gonna, we're gonna fix your son.
01:25:19.72 --> 01:25:20.56 Like what?
01:25:20.56 --> 01:25:23.20 And he's like, I'm gonna send the jet.
01:25:23.20 --> 01:25:25.24 I'm gonna assemble a team of doctors here in Texas
01:25:25.24 --> 01:25:26.76 and we're gonna fix him.
01:25:26.76 --> 01:25:28.60 And then he hangs up like,
01:25:28.60 --> 01:25:29.76 what just happened?
01:25:29.76 --> 01:25:30.64 That was wild.
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:31.48 And about an hour later,
01:25:31.48 --> 01:25:33.96 he's lead doctor at Southwestern Medical Center calls
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:36.20 and says, I know Mr. Perot is called you.
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:37.52 We're not gonna send the jet tomorrow,
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:38.64 but we are gonna send it.
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:41.08 And in the meantime, send us everything you have
01:25:41.08 --> 01:25:43.36 on your son and he medical records.
01:25:43.36 --> 01:25:45.48 We'll assemble a team of genetics specialists here
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:46.52 that will take a look at everything
01:25:46.52 --> 01:25:48.52 and we'll bring you guys in for some testing.
01:25:48.52 --> 01:25:50.28 And see what we can do.
01:25:50.28 --> 01:25:51.56 And it's like, wow, amazing.
01:25:51.56 --> 01:25:54.28 So a month later, they send the jet.
01:25:54.28 --> 01:25:57.60 G550 lands and we get on and head off to Texas
01:25:57.60 --> 01:26:00.52 and go to a week of testing in Dallas.
01:26:00.52 --> 01:26:03.36 And they send our blood all around the world
01:26:03.36 --> 01:26:06.16 and found a genetic specialist in the Netherlands
01:26:06.16 --> 01:26:08.16 who had just discovered the certain genetic mutation
01:26:08.16 --> 01:26:10.40 that helps form in the brain at birth.
01:26:10.40 --> 01:26:12.88 And now it has a name to it.
01:26:12.88 --> 01:26:15.000 It's the three doctors that discovered this.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.72 But when we found out about,
01:26:16.72 --> 01:26:18.28 he was the 13th person in the world.
01:26:18.28 --> 01:26:20.88 So number 13 in the world, they found with this.
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:23.80 And it was just called NR2F1,
01:26:23.80 --> 01:26:27.40 which is the gene that this mutation affects.
01:26:27.40 --> 01:26:31.000 And being able to put a name to it for us,
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.44 especially for my wife,
01:26:32.44 --> 01:26:34.48 that was so liberating.
01:26:34.48 --> 01:26:35.52 I can't really describe what it means.
01:26:35.52 --> 01:26:36.24 Just to put a name to it.
01:26:36.24 --> 01:26:37.68 It seems like a simple thing.
01:26:37.68 --> 01:26:39.56 But not knowing for six years
01:26:39.56 --> 01:26:40.96 and then being able to put a name to it
01:26:40.96 --> 01:26:43.60 and know that this is just one of those random,
01:26:43.60 --> 01:26:45.28 freaky things that happens.
01:26:45.28 --> 01:26:47.24 And there's nothing you could have done about it.
01:26:47.24 --> 01:26:49.20 And that's it.
01:26:49.20 --> 01:26:50.72 Just we got to put a name to it.
01:26:50.72 --> 01:26:51.88 So it was like, Roger that.
01:26:51.88 --> 01:26:53.92 Okay, now what do we do?
01:26:53.92 --> 01:26:55.92 And for us, that's our mission in life.
01:26:55.92 --> 01:26:57.28 Can we give us purpose?
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:58.88 And that purpose in mission is to make sure
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:01.72 that he reaches his full potential, whatever that may be.
01:27:01.72 --> 01:27:04.44 But he needs 24, seven full-time care for life.
01:27:04.44 --> 01:27:08.20 So, and we have two kids bracketing him on either side.
01:27:08.20 --> 01:27:09.80 So the real challenge is raising those kids
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:12.24 so that their childhood is not solely defined
01:27:12.24 --> 01:27:13.72 by the brother's condition.
01:27:13.72 --> 01:27:16.88 And hopefully it makes us all more loving,
01:27:16.88 --> 01:27:18.48 more compassionate people.
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:20.24 And so far it's worked out that way.
01:27:20.24 --> 01:27:22.92 But once again, my wife still bears the brunt of that every day
01:27:22.92 --> 01:27:23.88 because I'm out here.
01:27:23.88 --> 01:27:25.72 You know, I'm having a nice dinner last night.
01:27:25.72 --> 01:27:27.52 I'm here hanging out with you.
01:27:27.52 --> 01:27:28.64 And she's at home.
01:27:28.64 --> 01:27:29.48 Really?
01:27:29.48 --> 01:27:32.48 I'm going to get the bad guy.
01:27:32.48 --> 01:27:33.48 I'm going to go on book tour.
01:27:33.48 --> 01:27:34.48 I'm going to go on book tour.
01:27:34.48 --> 01:27:36.48 And I'm shaking hands and I'm saying,
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:38.48 I'll add, she's got it.
01:27:38.48 --> 01:27:41.48 The wives that the wives are incredible.
01:27:41.48 --> 01:27:43.48 Mine included, she raised four kids.
01:27:43.48 --> 01:27:45.48 And I was barely ever around.
01:27:45.48 --> 01:27:49.48 So, and same thing with every guy that we have on here,
01:27:49.48 --> 01:27:53.48 the talks about what their wives had to.
01:27:53.48 --> 01:27:56.48 And I think Jason Gardner, when he was on,
01:27:56.48 --> 01:27:59.48 he said, the first time he was on, he said, put up with his wife.
01:27:59.48 --> 01:28:00.48 He had to put up with a lot.
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:03.48 And then he came back on and said, like, he didn't mean it like that.
01:28:03.48 --> 01:28:06.48 It's like actually had the strength to handle.
01:28:06.48 --> 01:28:09.48 He just bought the appropriate statement is, hey,
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:11.48 you know, the wives that stick around,
01:28:11.48 --> 01:28:13.48 which is in a big number.
01:28:13.48 --> 01:28:14.48 Right.
01:28:14.48 --> 01:28:18.48 Most women don't have the strength to get through this and deal with this kind of thing.
01:28:18.48 --> 01:28:21.48 But, you know, obviously your wife is insane.
01:28:21.48 --> 01:28:23.48 And as his mind and like, okay,
01:28:23.48 --> 01:28:25.48 you're going to be gone all the time.
01:28:25.48 --> 01:28:27.48 So, I think that's the best thing to do.
01:28:27.48 --> 01:28:29.48 And that's how it has to be.
01:28:29.48 --> 01:28:31.48 So, now, hopefully the pendulum is not quite like this.
01:28:31.48 --> 01:28:34.48 You're like, I'm not dealing with life and death situations.
01:28:34.48 --> 01:28:36.48 So, I can help out a little more.
01:28:36.48 --> 01:28:38.48 But I'm still, this is an entrepreneurial type venture,
01:28:38.48 --> 01:28:40.48 writing is not just writing in a cave somewhere
01:28:40.48 --> 01:28:42.48 and setting it off to New York.
01:28:42.48 --> 01:28:44.48 It's everything that goes along with building a small business.
01:28:44.48 --> 01:28:46.48 So, right now, it's a full-on sprint.
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:47.48 We have momentum.
01:28:47.48 --> 01:28:51.48 And I don't really have any other speed besides just all in.
01:28:51.48 --> 01:28:53.48 So, sort of building this thing.
01:28:53.48 --> 01:28:55.48 But it's not like you're deploying for six months.
01:28:55.48 --> 01:28:57.48 Other things do shift now.
01:28:57.48 --> 01:29:00.48 So, now, even a, like a two-week trip,
01:29:00.48 --> 01:29:02.48 that's like a six-month deployment.
01:29:02.48 --> 01:29:05.48 Relatively now, because it's not the country asking you to do this.
01:29:05.48 --> 01:29:08.48 You don't owe it to the guys or the mission anymore.
01:29:08.48 --> 01:29:09.48 Type thing.
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:13.48 But, yeah, I know I'm super, super fortunate to have a wife that I do.
01:29:13.48 --> 01:29:14.48 She's so strong.
01:29:14.48 --> 01:29:17.48 And Arizona is so easy to leaven now.
01:29:17.48 --> 01:29:20.48 And it has a mental capacity to be able to do your old.
01:29:20.48 --> 01:29:24.48 I'd say. But with only the so few people in the world diagnosed with this,
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:27.48 I think now they're probably up to, must be in the 70s now.
01:29:27.48 --> 01:29:33.48 But, you know, every day is still a struggle.
01:29:33.48 --> 01:29:36.48 And, but that's our mission.
01:29:36.48 --> 01:29:37.48 You know, we got him for a reason.
01:29:37.48 --> 01:29:40.48 And that's, I look at it as we got him because we're strong enough
01:29:40.48 --> 01:29:42.48 to handle it.
01:29:42.48 --> 01:29:45.48 And that's, I don't know how to, you know, house you do look at it.
01:29:45.48 --> 01:29:46.48 I don't really know.
01:29:46.48 --> 01:29:48.48 And then, so as this is going on,
01:29:48.48 --> 01:29:51.48 was that one of the things that made you think about getting out of the Navy?
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:54.48 Oh yeah. So I didn't think about it while I was doing that OSC Platoon,
01:29:54.48 --> 01:29:57.48 or doing my troop commander tour because I was just all in.
01:29:57.48 --> 01:29:59.48 But once I got back, like when that plane took off,
01:29:59.48 --> 01:30:01.48 when we landed in San Diego, when I took a breath,
01:30:01.48 --> 01:30:03.48 realized I'm going to buzz, I see people,
01:30:03.48 --> 01:30:07.48 guys running on the beach, you know, doing the, doing the buzz thing.
01:30:07.48 --> 01:30:09.48 That's not why I came in.
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:12.48 I came in, I came in to do the job, I'd done the job.
01:30:12.48 --> 01:30:16.48 Now I owe it to my family to, to let that pendulum go back
01:30:16.48 --> 01:30:19.48 and take care of them. So it was very obvious to me.
01:30:19.48 --> 01:30:21.48 It wasn't like, it wasn't something I struggled with.
01:30:21.48 --> 01:30:23.48 I think a lot of guys, like, should I get a stand?
01:30:23.48 --> 01:30:24.48 Should I get out?
01:30:24.48 --> 01:30:27.48 What's my, hard time with that transition?
01:30:27.48 --> 01:30:29.48 Mine was not difficult.
01:30:29.48 --> 01:30:32.48 Neither was the decision to get out because I was handed my next mission.
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:34.48 Really, which is didn't care of the family,
01:30:34.48 --> 01:30:36.48 and especially our middle child.
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:39.48 So in that respect, my transition,
01:30:39.48 --> 01:30:41.48 easy, so wrong word.
01:30:41.48 --> 01:30:43.48 But I knew what I needed to do.
01:30:43.48 --> 01:30:44.48 The decision was clear.
01:30:44.48 --> 01:30:45.48 Yep.
01:30:45.48 --> 01:30:47.48 So no wavering.
01:30:47.48 --> 01:30:52.48 And then you knew from your previous, from your childhood
01:30:52.48 --> 01:30:56.48 that the job you were going to take, the job you're going to go after
01:30:56.48 --> 01:30:59.48 after you retired was going to be a writer.
01:30:59.48 --> 01:31:00.48 Yep.
01:31:00.48 --> 01:31:03.48 Yeah. And of course, you can't say that, especially at that time in the
01:31:03.48 --> 01:31:06.48 steel teams, like, you know, the, the men, lot of the stuff is going on.
01:31:06.48 --> 01:31:10.48 And all that. So that's when I played very close to the chest,
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:12.48 I say, to the best.
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:14.48 So I knew what I wanted to do my whole life.
01:31:14.48 --> 01:31:16.48 And I didn't think about it while I was in the team.
01:31:16.48 --> 01:31:18.48 It was just like, that's what I'm going to do next to there.
01:31:18.48 --> 01:31:21.48 That's the amount of thought I put into writing when I was in the teams.
01:31:21.48 --> 01:31:25.48 But everything that I read, growing up, was part of that education.
01:31:25.48 --> 01:31:29.48 All the reading, the on fiction that I did on in certain season,
01:31:29.48 --> 01:31:32.48 terrorism, all that fit into it, and all the personal experience down
01:31:32.48 --> 01:31:36.48 range. So it's almost like I could not be more prepared for what I'm
01:31:36.48 --> 01:31:38.48 doing now as a writer.
01:31:38.48 --> 01:31:42.48 But I didn't, during those last couple years, I was just like, okay,
01:31:42.48 --> 01:31:45.48 up so I'd buds then to Jean after training course,
01:31:45.48 --> 01:31:48.48 OIC, which was a great result in a couple months, but I love that
01:31:48.48 --> 01:31:51.48 because you get to pass on some lessons.
01:31:51.48 --> 01:31:53.48 And then, you know, move on out.
01:31:53.48 --> 01:31:58.48 But that last year in the Navy, and I think I heard you talk about this before,
01:31:58.48 --> 01:32:00.48 and that you didn't do all these things that you're supposed to do
01:32:00.48 --> 01:32:01.48 and you get out.
01:32:01.48 --> 01:32:03.48 Like, I went into the, what are the taps?
01:32:03.48 --> 01:32:04.48 Whatever that course was awful.
01:32:04.48 --> 01:32:06.48 I could do all those things that you're supposed to do.
01:32:06.48 --> 01:32:07.48 I didn't do anything.
01:32:07.48 --> 01:32:10.48 I heard you say that I'm like, you could, how did you get out of that?
01:32:10.48 --> 01:32:12.48 Well, that was going to tell you what's, I mean, you're big dude.
01:32:12.48 --> 01:32:14.48 You're not, you're not going to tell you you got to do this.
01:32:14.48 --> 01:32:17.48 But I went, I did that course and I went to medical,
01:32:17.48 --> 01:32:19.48 and I went to dental, and I did all this signature
01:32:19.48 --> 01:32:21.48 reason, like, I got my paperwork in order.
01:32:21.48 --> 01:32:23.48 And that was like the whole last year, the Navy.
01:32:23.48 --> 01:32:27.48 It was a spine surgery, had spine surgery in there last year, yeah.
01:32:27.48 --> 01:32:28.48 So that was good.
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:31.48 And so got all that taken, taken care of.
01:32:31.48 --> 01:32:35.48 But it's during that time when I'm like, okay, my job is to get out of the Navy now.
01:32:35.48 --> 01:32:37.48 Well, now I'm going to start thinking about the writing thing.
01:32:37.48 --> 01:32:40.48 And that's when I wrote down about seven different ideas.
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:42.48 I put them on the table and front of me, like one page,
01:32:42.48 --> 01:32:43.48 synopsis type things.
01:32:43.48 --> 01:32:46.48 And I chose the one that I thought would resonate with people the most.
01:32:46.48 --> 01:32:48.48 And that's that, that theme of a range.
01:32:48.48 --> 01:32:51.48 Because that's a, that's resonated with me as a kid,
01:32:51.48 --> 01:32:53.48 grown up both in movies and books.
01:32:53.48 --> 01:32:56.48 And it's something that just resonates with people in general.
01:32:56.48 --> 01:32:58.48 Is that theme for whatever reason?
01:32:58.48 --> 01:33:00.48 So I knew the first book would be,
01:33:00.48 --> 01:33:02.48 would that be the theme of the first novel?
01:33:02.48 --> 01:33:06.48 And then when did you start actually writing it?
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:08.48 During that last year.
01:33:08.48 --> 01:33:14.48 So yeah, outline synopsis started writing title camera really quickly.
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:16.48 All that sort of thing.
01:33:16.48 --> 01:33:18.48 But then submitted it.
01:33:18.48 --> 01:33:21.48 So I got out somewhere of 2016 was my retirement.
01:33:21.48 --> 01:33:26.48 And submitted it to Simon and Schuster in the fall of 2016.
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.48 And I got very lucky, very, very lucky.
01:33:29.48 --> 01:33:32.48 And that friend calls me out of the blue and he says,
01:33:32.48 --> 01:33:34.48 hey, do you know this author Brad Thor?
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:35.48 I said, oh.
01:33:35.48 --> 01:33:37.48 Yeah, of course I know him.
01:33:37.48 --> 01:33:39.48 And he said, well, I know you're writing this book.
01:33:39.48 --> 01:33:40.48 Do you want to talk to him?
01:33:40.48 --> 01:33:41.48 Maybe I submit advice for you.
01:33:41.48 --> 01:33:43.48 And I said, will he talk to me?
01:33:43.48 --> 01:33:44.48 And he said, let me set it up.
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:45.48 Yeah.
01:33:45.48 --> 01:33:47.48 It's a former CEO who's out in the finance world now.
01:33:47.48 --> 01:33:49.48 And they sent next to each other at some fundraiser or something.
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:52.48 And so I get on the phone with this Brad Thor guy.
01:33:52.48 --> 01:33:54.48 And he could not have been more generous with this time.
01:33:54.48 --> 01:33:55.48 It was kind of like an interview.
01:33:55.48 --> 01:33:57.48 It was kind of like a wide, you want to write type of thing.
01:33:57.48 --> 01:34:01.48 That was the underlying kind of theme of our conversation.
01:34:01.48 --> 01:34:03.48 And I think he wanted to make sure I was doing it for the right reasons.
01:34:03.48 --> 01:34:07.48 And you know, told him the truth about my mom being a librarian and reading all this stuff growing up.
01:34:07.48 --> 01:34:09.48 And all these authors I love and wanting to do this forever.
01:34:09.48 --> 01:34:13.48 And he's like, all right, I'm not going to help you as you go along.
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:14.48 So don't send me chapters.
01:34:14.48 --> 01:34:15.48 Don't ask me questions.
01:34:15.48 --> 01:34:19.48 But if you write a book, if you finish a book, I will let seven issues
01:34:19.48 --> 01:34:21.48 to know that it's coming.
01:34:21.48 --> 01:34:22.48 Can't guarantee the open it.
01:34:22.48 --> 01:34:24.48 Definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it.
01:34:24.48 --> 01:34:26.48 If they breed it.
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:29.48 But as a thank you, your friend told me some of things you did in the teams.
01:34:29.48 --> 01:34:30.48 And as a thank you for that.
01:34:30.48 --> 01:34:32.48 I will let them know it's coming.
01:34:32.48 --> 01:34:33.48 And I'm like Roger that.
01:34:33.48 --> 01:34:34.48 And he said, what are you going to be done?
01:34:34.48 --> 01:34:36.48 I said, one year from today.
01:34:36.48 --> 01:34:39.48 And call them back one year to the day later.
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:41.48 And as I did, you remember me?
01:34:41.48 --> 01:34:42.48 And he sure did.
01:34:42.48 --> 01:34:43.48 And I said, it's done.
01:34:43.48 --> 01:34:45.48 And he said, well, it's done.
01:34:45.48 --> 01:34:47.48 He says the best it can possibly be.
01:34:47.48 --> 01:34:51.48 As like, well, no, no, I can still work on it a little more.
01:34:51.48 --> 01:34:52.48 But it's done.
01:34:52.48 --> 01:34:56.48 He said, well, call me back when it's the best that it can possibly be.
01:34:56.48 --> 01:34:57.48 And I said, Roger that.
01:34:57.48 --> 01:35:00.48 So I took another four months of reading, editing, rewriting,
01:35:00.48 --> 01:35:06.48 getting it to, you know, if you've helped out for 10 years, you could probably make it better by degree.
01:35:06.48 --> 01:35:10.48 But I mean, it was at that stage where it was ready for another set of eyes.
01:35:10.48 --> 01:35:12.48 And call them back four months later.
01:35:12.48 --> 01:35:15.48 And he said, okay, I let my editor know it's coming and ship it off.
01:35:15.48 --> 01:35:16.48 And she read it.
01:35:16.48 --> 01:35:19.48 Next thing, you know, I'm going to play in the York and we're having coffee.
01:35:19.48 --> 01:35:21.48 And I think you want to make sure I was in a crazy person.
01:35:21.48 --> 01:35:23.48 And she said, I want this thing.
01:35:23.48 --> 01:35:24.48 But you need an agent.
01:35:24.48 --> 01:35:26.48 And I'm like, well, how do you get one of those?
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:28.48 And so she entered his meet a four agents.
01:35:28.48 --> 01:35:31.48 And then I, I chose one next thing.
01:35:31.48 --> 01:35:32.48 You know, we're off to the races.
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:34.48 So I got very lucky.
01:35:34.48 --> 01:35:36.48 Yeah, that's awesome.
01:35:36.48 --> 01:35:37.48 It does take a little bit of luck.
01:35:37.48 --> 01:35:40.48 How do you actually mechanically write?
01:35:40.48 --> 01:35:42.48 Like, what do you actually do?
01:35:42.48 --> 01:35:43.48 Yep.
01:35:43.48 --> 01:35:47.48 So all those seven different synopsis that I had at the time.
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:48.48 Where I picked the one.
01:35:48.48 --> 01:35:51.48 Now all those other ones are turning in to these next novels.
01:35:51.48 --> 01:35:53.48 Even though I'm not had different characters or whatever.
01:35:53.48 --> 01:35:54.48 I can morph those ones.
01:35:54.48 --> 01:35:57.48 So I have about seven different novels in the pipe ready to go.
01:35:57.48 --> 01:36:01.48 So start with that idea, the synopsis, like a one-page or two-pager,
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:02.48 then an outline.
01:36:02.48 --> 01:36:05.48 And then as I write, I fill in that outline because new things.
01:36:05.48 --> 01:36:07.48 Any ideas come up, new chapters, new characters.
01:36:07.48 --> 01:36:08.48 And I added to that outline.
01:36:08.48 --> 01:36:11.48 So that, and it was in Word up until very recently.
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:14.48 And I, so I have a visual representation.
01:36:14.48 --> 01:36:15.48 What's, what do you switch to for Word?
01:36:15.48 --> 01:36:16.48 To a scriptner.
01:36:16.48 --> 01:36:17.48 Oh, okay.
01:36:17.48 --> 01:36:18.48 We shall get to here in a second.
01:36:18.48 --> 01:36:19.48 Game changing.
01:36:19.48 --> 01:36:23.48 So yeah, in words, your scroll and copying and pasting,
01:36:23.48 --> 01:36:24.48 moving chapters around.
01:36:24.48 --> 01:36:26.48 And then, you know, I don't want to cut.
01:36:26.48 --> 01:36:29.48 And then I have a disappear because the nervous is it backed up?
01:36:29.48 --> 01:36:30.48 Oh my god.
01:36:30.48 --> 01:36:34.48 So, so yeah, so I'm feeling that a little bit paranoid.
01:36:34.48 --> 01:36:35.48 Exactly.
01:36:35.48 --> 01:36:36.48 Don't even cut in face.
01:36:36.48 --> 01:36:37.48 I want to copy it.
01:36:37.48 --> 01:36:38.48 Just in case.
01:36:38.48 --> 01:36:39.48 Just in case.
01:36:39.48 --> 01:36:41.48 The power goes out at that moment.
01:36:41.48 --> 01:36:43.48 Something that I hit the wrong thing and it's gone.
01:36:43.48 --> 01:36:47.48 So, yeah, I fill in that outline till I'd say about 75%.
01:36:47.48 --> 01:36:52.48 And then it becomes not as efficient for me to continue to just have an outline.
01:36:52.48 --> 01:36:53.48 That's now very complete.
01:36:53.48 --> 01:36:57.48 Now, I can just transition to just the story about that point.
01:36:57.48 --> 01:36:59.48 But you know, recently, I found out about this thing,
01:36:59.48 --> 01:37:00.48 Scrivener.
01:37:00.48 --> 01:37:03.48 And that it's set up very much like Word.
01:37:03.48 --> 01:37:06.48 But you, it's broken down by chapter.
01:37:06.48 --> 01:37:09.48 So you can drag and drop chapters and see how it looks.
01:37:09.48 --> 01:37:11.48 You can have each one of those chapters have a synopsis.
01:37:11.48 --> 01:37:13.48 So it shows up as essentially like a car,
01:37:13.48 --> 01:37:16.48 gray yellow sticky, and you're looking at this whole thing.
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:17.48 And they go, you know what?
01:37:17.48 --> 01:37:19.48 Chapter six should really be Chapter three.
01:37:19.48 --> 01:37:20.48 Drag, drop.
01:37:20.48 --> 01:37:22.48 And you can move in research.
01:37:22.48 --> 01:37:25.48 So you can drag in articles from online, pictures,
01:37:25.48 --> 01:37:27.48 video, into research folders.
01:37:27.48 --> 01:37:29.48 So it's all right there.
01:37:29.48 --> 01:37:30.48 Instead of like, what file was that?
01:37:30.48 --> 01:37:31.48 Did I copy?
01:37:31.48 --> 01:37:38.48 You are like a day late and eight books to late for me at this point.
01:37:38.48 --> 01:37:42.48 Seriously, like that sounds like brilliance.
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:43.48 Yeah.
01:37:43.48 --> 01:37:44.48 And I could so use that.
01:37:44.48 --> 01:37:47.48 And I just finished my eighth book.
01:37:47.48 --> 01:37:48.48 Nice.
01:37:48.48 --> 01:37:50.48 So that sucks.
01:37:50.48 --> 01:37:51.48 Yeah.
01:37:51.48 --> 01:37:52.48 Well, for nine.
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:53.48 Yeah.
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:54.48 And for nine.
01:37:54.48 --> 01:37:56.48 Which I started yesterday.
01:37:56.48 --> 01:37:57.48 Yep.
01:37:57.48 --> 01:37:58.48 And can import from words.
01:37:58.48 --> 01:38:01.48 So I had about half of the, you import from word and it breaks it into chapters.
01:38:01.48 --> 01:38:04.48 You just put an icon and let it know whatever that little symbol is.
01:38:04.48 --> 01:38:06.48 Where you want the chapter breaks.
01:38:06.48 --> 01:38:07.48 And then can you export it back to word?
01:38:07.48 --> 01:38:08.48 And I haven't done that yet.
01:38:08.48 --> 01:38:12.48 So I will be doing that in the next couple of weeks for book three.
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:15.48 But I have not actually, I've imported from word.
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:16.48 I've not exported.
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:17.48 So you can say you can.
01:38:17.48 --> 01:38:18.48 Yep.
01:38:18.48 --> 01:38:20.48 They say you can in the tutorial video and they show you how.
01:38:20.48 --> 01:38:21.48 But I've not done that.
01:38:21.48 --> 01:38:22.48 Check.
01:38:22.48 --> 01:38:23.48 Yeah.
01:38:23.48 --> 01:38:24.48 Yeah.
01:38:24.48 --> 01:38:24.48 I'm all over it.
01:38:24.48 --> 01:38:25.48 Good night.
01:38:25.48 --> 01:38:26.48 I like it word.
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:30.48 So before we nerd out too hard on this, we'll move under something else.
01:38:30.48 --> 01:38:31.48 Yeah.
01:38:31.48 --> 01:38:35.48 So you get done with these.
01:38:35.48 --> 01:38:37.48 And where did you, I mean, what did you do with your family?
01:38:37.48 --> 01:38:40.48 Once you retired because you have the mission of your kid.
01:38:40.48 --> 01:38:41.48 Yep.
01:38:41.48 --> 01:38:42.48 And your kids.
01:38:42.48 --> 01:38:44.48 You had the mission now that you got to finish this book.
01:38:44.48 --> 01:38:46.48 Did you finish that book while you're still active?
01:38:46.48 --> 01:38:47.48 No.
01:38:47.48 --> 01:38:49.48 So I finished it just a four months afterwards.
01:38:49.48 --> 01:38:54.48 So you set yourself up financially somewhat that you were in a survival scenario even without
01:38:54.48 --> 01:38:56.48 Alternating Compass, I'd your retirement.
01:38:56.48 --> 01:38:58.48 I had other businesses.
01:38:58.48 --> 01:39:01.48 You had some other little, you had some other little side things going on.
01:39:01.48 --> 01:39:02.48 Yeah.
01:39:02.48 --> 01:39:03.48 You've got enough money to float this gig.
01:39:03.48 --> 01:39:04.48 Yep.
01:39:04.48 --> 01:39:08.48 I have an operation in Hawaii, a hunting operation out there with a couple of the partners.
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:10.48 Every show off in someone who has made these.
01:39:10.48 --> 01:39:11.48 I'm speaking or whatever.
01:39:11.48 --> 01:39:12.48 That sort of thing.
01:39:12.48 --> 01:39:14.48 It's a tactical training.
01:39:14.48 --> 01:39:16.48 A little things like that.
01:39:16.48 --> 01:39:20.48 I was set up to be able to move into this financially.
01:39:20.48 --> 01:39:23.48 And then where did you move to?
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:27.48 So we got out and we weren't planning on moving because our son, we thought, hey, we have this,
01:39:27.48 --> 01:39:31.48 the support network built up now over the last six, seven years.
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:34.48 It's here in San Diego and we can never move.
01:39:34.48 --> 01:39:38.48 We can't, we definitely can't go someplace where it's cold because he just lies down.
01:39:38.48 --> 01:39:42.48 And just, anyway, it would be very difficult to take him to a place where it was rainy,
01:39:42.48 --> 01:39:45.48 where it was snowy, where he had to put extra clothes on him.
01:39:45.48 --> 01:39:46.48 Like that sort of thing.
01:39:46.48 --> 01:39:51.48 And then we go to Park City, Utah, the winter after I get out.
01:39:51.48 --> 01:39:54.48 And we took our son on vacation with us for the first time.
01:39:54.48 --> 01:39:57.48 And we started going to Park City during my last couple of years when I'm not.
01:39:57.48 --> 01:39:58.48 So I built up a ton of leave.
01:39:58.48 --> 01:40:01.48 I never took leave in hotels last couple of years.
01:40:01.48 --> 01:40:05.48 Because last couple of years, I'm like, well, I'm not taking guys down range anymore.
01:40:05.48 --> 01:40:07.48 Let's start taking some leave.
01:40:07.48 --> 01:40:08.48 We have all this on the books.
01:40:08.48 --> 01:40:14.48 So we go to Park City with a friend from San Diego because he's easier to fly to Salt Lake and drive to Park City.
01:40:14.48 --> 01:40:18.48 And it was the drive through bands of traffic to get to the mammoth or Big Bear or whatever else.
01:40:18.48 --> 01:40:21.48 So we started doing that last couple of years.
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:23.48 And then we took our son on vacation with us.
01:40:23.48 --> 01:40:25.48 And then we took someone with us to help.
01:40:25.48 --> 01:40:27.48 So we had an extra set of hands.
01:40:27.48 --> 01:40:29.48 But we got there and we spent two weeks up in Park City.
01:40:29.48 --> 01:40:31.48 And we thought, you know what, we can do this.
01:40:31.48 --> 01:40:33.48 We're not tied to San Diego.
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:34.48 We brought someone.
01:40:34.48 --> 01:40:36.48 Yes, there was your full time.
01:40:36.48 --> 01:40:38.48 Yes, but we did it.
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:42.48 And that was like, that opened just three doors for us.
01:40:42.48 --> 01:40:44.48 And that we didn't think we're open to us ever.
01:40:44.48 --> 01:40:47.48 And while we were there, I opened this magazine and said,
01:40:47.48 --> 01:40:49.48 Hey, look at this house around the corner here.
01:40:49.48 --> 01:40:50.48 Let's go check this thing out.
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:52.48 So we drove around the corner, checked it out.
01:40:52.48 --> 01:40:53.48 And we're like, let's move.
01:40:53.48 --> 01:40:55.48 We decided to ride that in there to move.
01:40:55.48 --> 01:40:57.48 And got the house.
01:40:57.48 --> 01:40:58.48 And six months later we're there.
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:04.48 And I think it helped to make a physical and psychological break with the military for me.
01:41:04.48 --> 01:41:07.48 Because I was in Coronado and as the opposite of Buds,
01:41:07.48 --> 01:41:09.48 I saw so many guys that couldn't let it go.
01:41:09.48 --> 01:41:12.48 And obviously it's a huge part of who I am.
01:41:12.48 --> 01:41:15.48 It's in my, in my novels and all that stuff is a huge part of me.
01:41:15.48 --> 01:41:18.48 But I saw guys that kept coming back to Buds kept calling me as the obso.
01:41:18.48 --> 01:41:19.48 Can I get a tour?
01:41:19.48 --> 01:41:20.48 I want to show somebody around.
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:22.48 You know, problem come on in, you know.
01:41:22.48 --> 01:41:23.48 I pull them out.
01:41:23.48 --> 01:41:25.48 But I saw these couldn't let it go.
01:41:25.48 --> 01:41:27.48 Going to all the charity events.
01:41:27.48 --> 01:41:31.48 Going to the same bar is going to the same grocery store, especially in Coronado.
01:41:31.48 --> 01:41:32.48 Yeah.
01:41:32.48 --> 01:41:36.48 So I think for me, it was healthy to say that was one chapter of my life.
01:41:36.48 --> 01:41:37.48 Obviously a huge influence on him.
01:41:37.48 --> 01:41:39.48 I wanted to do it my whole life.
01:41:39.48 --> 01:41:40.48 But now I'm moving forward.
01:41:40.48 --> 01:41:42.48 And now there's a new chapter.
01:41:42.48 --> 01:41:43.48 And that's as an author.
01:41:43.48 --> 01:41:48.48 And that's taking care of my family and raising our kids to be good citizens and good people.
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:50.48 And that's what I'm going to do next.
01:41:50.48 --> 01:41:54.48 I think it just helped to not run into somebody at the grocery store from a pool to an empty building.
01:41:54.48 --> 01:41:55.48 Who's your CEO?
01:41:55.48 --> 01:41:58.48 What's, you know, and all those sorts of same questions.
01:41:58.48 --> 01:42:00.48 They just keep that tie.
01:42:00.48 --> 01:42:02.48 So being able to say goodbye to San Diego.
01:42:02.48 --> 01:42:03.48 No, San Diego is great to us.
01:42:03.48 --> 01:42:04.48 Love San Diego.
01:42:04.48 --> 01:42:05.48 Love Coronado.
01:42:05.48 --> 01:42:08.48 That was one part of our life in our new life is in the mountains.
01:42:08.48 --> 01:42:09.48 Face in our kids in a ski town.
01:42:09.48 --> 01:42:12.48 And you're super stoked right now on that.
01:42:12.48 --> 01:42:14.48 Yeah, love it over there.
01:42:14.48 --> 01:42:15.48 Love it over there.
01:42:15.48 --> 01:42:16.48 And we got there.
01:42:16.48 --> 01:42:17.48 We drove.
01:42:17.48 --> 01:42:18.48 We put that the you haul.
01:42:18.48 --> 01:42:20.48 Then we drove through the night and all that.
01:42:20.48 --> 01:42:21.48 And we get there.
01:42:21.48 --> 01:42:23.48 13 hours later because we're chugging along with this you haul.
01:42:23.48 --> 01:42:25.48 And we get unloaded.
01:42:25.48 --> 01:42:26.48 And the next day we go to the grocery store.
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:27.48 And we look around.
01:42:27.48 --> 01:42:30.48 And we're like, man, people in Park City are in good shape.
01:42:30.48 --> 01:42:32.48 Like we thought we were in pretty good shape in San Diego.
01:42:32.48 --> 01:42:34.48 Like these people are in the same in Park City.
01:42:34.48 --> 01:42:38.48 Just draws these people that want to raise their kids and ski
01:42:38.48 --> 01:42:39.48 towns.
01:42:39.48 --> 01:42:42.48 Usually they've done something somewhere else where they, you know,
01:42:42.48 --> 01:42:44.48 they're not whatever they can live there.
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:47.48 And they're really into being in shape.
01:42:47.48 --> 01:42:52.48 And being the best people physically mentally spiritually whatever.
01:42:52.48 --> 01:42:54.48 Just being the best, most efficient people they can be.
01:42:54.48 --> 01:42:56.48 And luckily, he had some friends up there already.
01:42:56.48 --> 01:43:00.48 And this insane group of guys that works out the morning wake up at five.
01:43:00.48 --> 01:43:03.48 And once again, that pendulum this last few months has been on the right
01:43:03.48 --> 01:43:04.48 thing.
01:43:04.48 --> 01:43:08.48 But when I first got there, I start working out with these guys that I knew from before.
01:43:08.48 --> 01:43:10.48 And I hope you darling is kind of the lead of that.
01:43:10.48 --> 01:43:13.48 Used to be the CEO of Skull Candy.
01:43:13.48 --> 01:43:16.48 And I see you or he has a bunch of other ventures.
01:43:16.48 --> 01:43:19.48 But this guy is in insane shape.
01:43:19.48 --> 01:43:22.48 And he's there every morning at five thirty with some crazy work out.
01:43:22.48 --> 01:43:25.48 Like picture your hardest crossfit work out.
01:43:25.48 --> 01:43:28.48 And then times it by three or four had some trail running.
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:29.48 It's crazy.
01:43:29.48 --> 01:43:31.48 And so I showed up with these guys.
01:43:31.48 --> 01:43:33.48 And they're awesome.
01:43:33.48 --> 01:43:35.48 But they're all about just human potential.
01:43:35.48 --> 01:43:37.48 I think is the best way to put it.
01:43:37.48 --> 01:43:39.48 And maximizing that potential.
01:43:39.48 --> 01:43:43.48 Whether it's your family, whether it's in business, personally, whatever.
01:43:43.48 --> 01:43:48.48 Just and stand up to date on the latest and the greatest and test and things out.
01:43:48.48 --> 01:43:50.48 And they're an amazing group of people.
01:43:50.48 --> 01:43:53.48 So I'm very fortunate to get to work out and spend time with them.
01:43:53.48 --> 01:43:54.48 So all high performers.
01:43:54.48 --> 01:43:55.48 We all push each other.
01:43:55.48 --> 01:43:57.48 And even though I'm not the not the fastest anymore.
01:43:57.48 --> 01:44:02.48 Especially with this crew, it's it's cool to get out there and and just be,
01:44:02.48 --> 01:44:03.48 you know, just be together.
01:44:03.48 --> 01:44:05.48 That a little team.
01:44:05.48 --> 01:44:06.48 Awesome.
01:44:06.48 --> 01:44:08.48 Well, I mean, it looks like we're in a pretty good.
01:44:08.48 --> 01:44:12.48 That's that gets us to today, you know, where you're at.
01:44:12.48 --> 01:44:15.48 Probably you could place to wrap the books.
01:44:15.48 --> 01:44:17.48 Tell us just a little bit about the books.
01:44:17.48 --> 01:44:19.48 What do we need to know about book one book two?
01:44:19.48 --> 01:44:20.48 Yeah.
01:44:20.48 --> 01:44:26.48 So the first ones, the terminal list, which I didn't say it out loud for about for the first year I was working on it.
01:44:26.48 --> 01:44:27.48 And I said it out loud for the first time.
01:44:27.48 --> 01:44:29.48 There's two else next to each other.
01:44:29.48 --> 01:44:30.48 And I said it for the first time.
01:44:30.48 --> 01:44:31.48 I was like, dang it.
01:44:31.48 --> 01:44:34.48 Like it's a tough one to say the terminal list.
01:44:34.48 --> 01:44:36.48 But it's based level.
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:38.48 It is a story of revenge without constraint.
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:40.48 And that's what I wanted to explore.
01:44:40.48 --> 01:44:44.48 And I think it was a door to team five ops, 1997.
01:44:44.48 --> 01:44:54.48 I saw that it's somebody Syrock's to copy a thing from the brand new internet that had a picture of a samurai on it.
01:44:54.48 --> 01:44:59.48 It said something about a samurai going into battle thinking they were already dead.
01:44:59.48 --> 01:45:09.48 And you know, I went back and looked at a lot of the shuto books from high school and college and thought, oh, they did that because they thought it made a more effective and efficient lawyers.
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:11.48 They're going into battle already dead.
01:45:11.48 --> 01:45:13.48 So I thought, how do you do that with a modern lawyer?
01:45:13.48 --> 01:45:16.48 How do you do that with someone that has a background similar to mine?
01:45:16.48 --> 01:45:23.48 So I can explore these feelings and emotions behind different experiences that I had downrange and a completely fictional sense.
01:45:23.48 --> 01:45:25.48 How do I make him already dead?
01:45:25.48 --> 01:45:28.48 And then I thought about the church hearings in the late 70s.
01:45:28.48 --> 01:45:38.48 And now the government had tested certain drugs on our nation soldiers on mental patients, mental institutions, college students without any review.
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:44.48 Any sort of structured in place with how that's going to go down and things changed after that.
01:45:44.48 --> 01:45:46.48 And I thought, what if somebody didn't get that memo?
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:51.48 But if there was something they wanted to test out, they wanted to test it out on some of our nation's most elite soldiers.
01:45:51.48 --> 01:45:53.48 And then something goes wrong.
01:45:53.48 --> 01:45:56.48 So how do I free this guy up to think he's already dead?
01:45:56.48 --> 01:46:04.48 And they come back and have to use the tactics, techniques and procedures of the enemy on home soil.
01:46:04.48 --> 01:46:14.48 So essentially I wanted someone that thought they were already dead that now gets to bring what was so effective against us in Iraq and Afghanistan to home soil as he works his way up a list,
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:17.48 putting the bad guys in the ground, one by one.
01:46:17.48 --> 01:46:26.48 So that's really what that first one's about. And then if you dig a little deeper into it more psychological wise, I guess.
01:46:26.48 --> 01:46:35.48 It's about a veteran that comes home and brings the wars from Iraq and Afghanistan home to people that have been sending young men and women to their deaths for close.
01:46:35.48 --> 01:46:38.48 Well, coming up on 20 years now pretty soon.
01:46:38.48 --> 01:46:42.48 So you can read it like that too, but that's deep.
01:46:42.48 --> 01:46:43.48 That's deep.
01:46:43.48 --> 01:46:45.48 So you're going to the words you pick up with true believer.
01:46:45.48 --> 01:46:58.48 So it's a continuation of the story. So in high school I saw it's a it was on PBS and it was a special with Bill Moyers and he had an interview with a guy named Joseph Campbell who wrote a book called the Power of Myth and the hero with a thousand faces.
01:46:58.48 --> 01:47:08.48 And I was fascinated by it because while I already go on to write one day and I remember they talked about George Lucas being influenced by this for Star Wars and the samurai aspect of different things.
01:47:08.48 --> 01:47:15.48 And then how across culture the hero's journey is similar, very similar for the cultures that had never touched each other before.
01:47:15.48 --> 01:47:19.48 Yeah, China, Native American Indian Africa Northern Europe.
01:47:19.48 --> 01:47:28.48 They all had this similar journey. And usually it's a reluctant hero that goes on a journey emerges transformed at the end of that journey.
01:47:28.48 --> 01:47:33.48 So that was a big influence. So as writing these, you have to call Mike in the dragons.
01:47:33.48 --> 01:47:41.48 I was just reading that to Mike in the other night. And yeah, so he has to go, he had to go into the cave and you have to emerge transformed.
01:47:41.48 --> 01:47:47.48 But how do you do that with one book and how do you make that overarching a series as well. So there's two things I think about as I'm writing.
01:47:47.48 --> 01:47:51.48 I think about that hero's journey in the context of one singular story.
01:47:51.48 --> 01:47:57.48 And then over what I hope will be a long term series. So that's what I'm thinking about as I write these things.
01:47:57.48 --> 01:48:04.48 And then true believers, the continuation of that story. But it's was inspired by somebody I met in Iraq in 2006.
01:48:04.48 --> 01:48:08.48 And I thought, what have I made this interaction and what I heard through the great fine later?
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:13.48 What have I made this a lot more interesting and fictionalized it? And so that's where the second one picks up.
01:48:13.48 --> 01:48:19.48 And it's really a story of redemption. And taking the, still taking the emotions and the feelings,
01:48:19.48 --> 01:48:29.48 and the feelings, by and certain things that happened down range. But also now exploring what that transition was like, because the hero here in the story James Reese has to go through a transformative journey.
01:48:29.48 --> 01:48:32.48 And the second one's all about redemption.
01:48:32.48 --> 01:48:36.48 And when does when does book to when's true believer come out?
01:48:36.48 --> 01:48:38.48 July 30th July 30th. That comes out.
01:48:38.48 --> 01:48:40.48 Internal list is out right now.
01:48:40.48 --> 01:48:43.48 It is out. Yeah, second one should have come out April 2nd.
01:48:43.48 --> 01:48:48.48 But the department of defense took seven months to do a 30 day review sort of make sure I was honoring my former security.
01:48:48.48 --> 01:48:51.48 Clarences by submitting it to the department of defense.
01:48:51.48 --> 01:48:57.48 You just leave the stuff that they tell you to take out or the stuff that they tell you to redact. You just, you just black it out.
01:48:57.48 --> 01:49:01.48 I just black it out. I didn't know if I ride around it. And my still, you just,
01:49:01.48 --> 01:49:03.48 I don't know if one is you did that in true in the terminal list too.
01:49:03.48 --> 01:49:04.48 Yeah.
01:49:04.48 --> 01:49:07.48 When you said it to me, I, you gave me heads up. You said, hey, I just blocked things out.
01:49:07.48 --> 01:49:11.48 And you know, obviously my books have been, well, not my kids books, but my other books have been through the Pentagon review.
01:49:11.48 --> 01:49:15.48 And they tell you that, get removed certain things and we would remove it and change it.
01:49:15.48 --> 01:49:18.48 So it's acceptable to them, but you just blacked it out.
01:49:18.48 --> 01:49:26.48 Yeah, I was worried like if I ride around this and then I publish it and then when they come back and say, well, you didn't quite ride around that enough.
01:49:26.48 --> 01:49:28.48 But you do that just to be cool kind of.
01:49:28.48 --> 01:49:30.48 And it also has a lot of intensity.
01:49:30.48 --> 01:49:32.48 Help with the marketing.
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:32.48 Yeah.
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:37.48 And it's like, I mean, I was, I was looking through it and looking at like one, and I can, I can figure out a lot of them.
01:49:37.48 --> 01:49:40.48 I got, oh, they, they didn't want them to say that. Oh, they didn't want them to say that.
01:49:40.48 --> 01:49:44.48 So it's pretty cool. But you can still, I mean, obviously you can still understand all the context around it.
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:52.48 You just don't know a certain like specific term or a certain specific location or a certain specific name.
01:49:52.48 --> 01:49:55.48 But yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty cool.
01:49:55.48 --> 01:49:56.48 Yeah.
01:49:56.48 --> 01:49:57.48 Cool that you left it in there.
01:49:57.48 --> 01:49:59.48 And the books are available everywhere everywhere.
01:49:59.48 --> 01:50:00.48 Yeah.
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:01.48 Every audio people love the audio.
01:50:01.48 --> 01:50:02.48 Ray Porter does the audio.
01:50:02.48 --> 01:50:05.48 He's an awesome to do this up for audio book of the year this year.
01:50:05.48 --> 01:50:06.48 So we're in New York and it's up there.
01:50:06.48 --> 01:50:08.48 Well, I texted you because you're out there.
01:50:08.48 --> 01:50:11.48 You're in your, and you're, you're kind of going, so it's texting you.
01:50:11.48 --> 01:50:13.48 I had to go picture the screen and everything.
01:50:13.48 --> 01:50:14.48 But it's cool.
01:50:14.48 --> 01:50:14.48 It's in it up there.
01:50:14.48 --> 01:50:15.48 It's a Stephen King.
01:50:15.48 --> 01:50:17.48 I got like, that was pretty cool.
01:50:17.48 --> 01:50:18.48 That was pretty cool.
01:50:18.48 --> 01:50:27.48 You, to find you, you got your website, which is official jackcard.com.
01:50:27.48 --> 01:50:30.48 That's it because you didn't buy the URL jackcard early.
01:50:30.48 --> 01:50:33.48 I think an insurance guy has it in the asking room.
01:50:33.48 --> 01:50:35.48 Guys holding it for the hostage.
01:50:35.48 --> 01:50:37.48 And you're never going to get it out.
01:50:37.48 --> 01:50:39.48 Well, maybe you will never say never.
01:50:39.48 --> 01:50:40.48 Yeah.
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:42.48 So that's, yeah, that's a, and that's one that's people want to do.
01:50:42.48 --> 01:50:46.48 And that's people want to geek out a little more on the weapons and knives.
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:47.48 That sort of thing.
01:50:47.48 --> 01:50:51.48 The website goes deep dives into a lot more of that stuff in the books.
01:50:51.48 --> 01:50:52.48 Because you get your nerd on.

01:51:05.48 --> 01:51:06.48 So it's on there.
01:51:06.48 --> 01:51:09.48 And then on the, on the socials, which I am very new to.
01:51:09.48 --> 01:51:11.48 I'm about a year and a half into this now.

01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:14.48 You know, the socials.
01:51:14.48 --> 01:51:17.48 And there is a Facebook, but three was just too much.
01:51:17.48 --> 01:51:21.48 Like so somebody else just copies and paste things in from there.
01:51:21.48 --> 01:51:21.48 Into there.
01:51:21.48 --> 01:51:24.48 But on Instagram and Twitter, Jack R USA.

01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:28.48 I'm in on those.
01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:29.48 But three years, just too daunting.
01:51:29.48 --> 01:51:30.48 Just kind of, I know it.
01:51:30.48 --> 01:51:31.48 Nope.
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:32.48 No, no, prioritize.
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:33.48 All three.
01:51:33.48 --> 01:51:35.48 Next level.
01:51:35.48 --> 01:51:37.48 I'm crazy like that.
01:51:37.48 --> 01:51:38.48 That's how super motivated.
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:39.48 I don't have.
01:51:39.48 --> 01:51:41.48 I don't have.
01:51:41.48 --> 01:51:42.48 I'm on three social media platforms.
01:51:42.48 --> 01:51:45.48 Kill me now and well, you know, usually I have a every now and again.
01:51:45.48 --> 01:51:47.48 I have a hard time going to sleep for my mind's racing.
01:51:47.48 --> 01:51:49.48 I'm thinking about all these things, thinking about story line,
01:51:49.48 --> 01:51:51.48 solving problems on the written page.
01:51:51.48 --> 01:51:53.48 Here aggressively, like I used to do on the battlefield.
01:51:53.48 --> 01:51:57.48 But usually I don't have a problem staying the sleep once I get there.
01:51:57.48 --> 01:52:00.48 This morning, up 307 a.m.
01:52:00.48 --> 01:52:02.48 And I'm like, tag and I took a picture of it for you.
01:52:02.48 --> 01:52:04.48 Cause I'm like, oh, did you post it?
01:52:04.48 --> 01:52:05.48 No.
01:52:05.48 --> 01:52:06.48 No, it did it a day.
01:52:06.48 --> 01:52:08.48 So I didn't, you know, I think that would be awesome.
01:52:08.48 --> 01:52:16.16 So I get my my day post on point. Yeah, but I will I will post it. D day awesome. Yeah, so
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:21.84 I think that's a good place to wrap it. You know echo. Mm-hmm. Jack was just talking about
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:25.44 Fitness. He's talking about being prepared
01:52:27.04 --> 01:52:30.64 Opened up talking about being a true believer that knows the cause
01:52:31.28 --> 01:52:36.40 Yeah, really. You know what do you know about you know sort of that cause being on the path
01:52:36.40 --> 01:52:42.56 Believe it in it truly yeah, fully. I do want to comment on how you blacked out the classified
01:52:43.76 --> 01:52:46.24 Parts of your book is kind of like in the movies, right?
01:52:46.88 --> 01:52:51.12 Or when they want to you know they show movies on HBO or in the cinema whatever. It's all good
01:52:52.08 --> 01:52:54.32 They put it on USA or one of these you know
01:52:55.36 --> 01:52:59.92 Networks they got edit it right edited for television so there's three ways they do it in the movies
01:52:59.92 --> 01:53:04.88 They either just take out the whole scene which is like what they do with books right sometimes like I
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:13.12 Guess they could yeah usually change it. Yes, which did you that movie still in the movie version? Yeah, they have a dubbed voice over for the swearing
01:53:13.52 --> 01:53:17.20 Yeah, and every once in a while you have a movie with an actual different scene
01:53:17.36 --> 01:53:22.32 Yeah, if you watch trading places or something on you have actual different scenes like that they read it
01:53:22.64 --> 01:53:27.44 Then the third is the blackout version and what you did which they just blank it out
01:53:27.44 --> 01:53:31.76 So if they're swearing he'll be like what the and the mouth will show it, but they just won't have the audio
01:53:31.76 --> 01:53:36.16 Right to me that's the best way to do it because it keeps you in the story you're like okay
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:40.16 He's so right there. I get it. You can't swear on tea on this network or whatever
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:47.28 But in my opinion this the blackout the physical like I just saw it in there it's physically blacked out
01:53:47.84 --> 01:53:50.56 And I highlighted lowlighted. Yeah, if you
01:53:51.12 --> 01:53:53.12 It gives it the mistake
01:53:53.12 --> 01:53:56.96 Kind of like there's something hidden under here. That's class why they can't know
01:53:56.96 --> 01:54:03.60 So classifying yeah, you can't know about you can't even know about it. Yeah, yeah, even even that it's fiction
01:54:03.76 --> 01:54:09.32 Which is even a lot like half level up even from yeah, yeah, like wait a second. They're redacting
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:11.92 Fiction what is that me
01:54:12.48 --> 01:54:18.52 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I know that you last when he said like secret because you and I both know what gets redacted
01:54:19.52 --> 01:54:21.52 And it's not really
01:54:21.52 --> 01:54:23.92 I know I built it up too much. Let me talk about it
01:54:23.92 --> 01:54:29.76 It's one of the major was we'll edit this out. Well, it's so well my plan to the first one
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:34.48 I didn't I didn't appeal so you're gonna year to appeal these things and I didn't do it the first ones
01:54:34.48 --> 01:54:36.48 I didn't have enough money
01:54:36.48 --> 01:54:39.28 So second one though. They took a lot more in this second one and
01:54:40.48 --> 01:54:42.08 I'm appealing this one
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:46.80 So and what you do for the appeal is you find the information on government websites
01:54:46.80 --> 01:54:52.08 You can't just go to Wikipedia whatever else but on actual government websites in congressional testimony
01:54:52.08 --> 01:54:55.28 Out there via the government
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:00.40 So repealing this one and almost everything in there except for one little phrase
01:55:01.20 --> 01:55:03.20 We found it on government websites
01:55:03.36 --> 01:55:08.24 So repealing so that if the paper back comes out in this now you can see what the government didn't want you to see
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:11.84 But it's I don't want to build it up too much because it's really
01:55:12.64 --> 01:55:14.64 It's not as cool as it's all
01:55:14.64 --> 01:55:16.64 No, but
01:55:16.64 --> 01:55:21.60 They took out so surprising as I made up so I made up a location because I'd been there
01:55:21.60 --> 01:55:23.60 Yeah, before I came in the one in the military
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:28.56 So I used it as a location in the novel because it made sense where it starts second one is kind of starts in Africa
01:55:28.56 --> 01:55:34.96 And then it goes up here and you know goes into whatever but I'm like that's a big good place for kind of the cave
01:55:35.12 --> 01:55:37.12 Gotta go there change gotta transform and
01:55:37.84 --> 01:55:41.04 So I just made it up because I'd been there. I can describe the rocks. I can describe the mountains
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:43.92 I can describe the architecture so I put it in there. They blacked it all out
01:55:44.16 --> 01:55:49.92 It's totally made up they blacked it all out but they left in by accident the
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:51.92 The
01:55:51.20 --> 01:55:55.04 The capital of that country. Yeah, so I blacked it out for them
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:00.56 Knowing in their intent I took it out for them, but they missed that they took out the type of architecture
01:56:00.56 --> 01:56:05.04 They took out the mountains they took out any reference to the country which is so strange
01:56:05.20 --> 01:56:09.36 But they left in by accident the capital and so what that happens right? Yeah
01:56:09.36 --> 01:56:11.36 That's somebody else was up in that cave
01:56:11.36 --> 01:56:13.76 Get yeah, we can't affirmation go it on
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:17.92 Exactly, through this stranger than fiction
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:21.52 Yeah, but that's good. That's another selling point in a way when you can say
01:56:22.08 --> 01:56:27.60 This like I'm revealing in this book what the government didn't want you to go back actually. Yep, exactly
01:56:27.60 --> 01:56:31.92 So the paper back to yep, yeah, obviously how goes cool man well
01:56:32.72 --> 01:56:34.96 One day what did you revisit you did to it? What?
01:56:35.36 --> 01:56:38.64 I think you're doing these hard acts about it. They're heavy's right now. I know I know I
01:56:39.04 --> 01:56:41.04 Dabbled through the years
01:56:41.44 --> 01:56:47.76 But I've essentially what I did open tell 95 that's really my base and I got I'm obviously shoot him
01:56:47.76 --> 01:56:50.96 Well, obviously so I'm shoot all the time staying safe that's sort of thing, but
01:56:51.52 --> 01:56:54.72 The jujitsu is whatever I am right now that is where my
01:56:55.04 --> 01:56:57.68 Markle ground fighting skills are going to remain
01:56:58.40 --> 01:57:00.72 Wait, why are you committing to that right? Yeah
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:07.36 So what is my surgery to just time wise and knowing where my focus needs to be right now
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:10.16 So what do you think's worse for your spine?
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:12.80 Clean in jerks or
01:57:12.80 --> 01:57:18.96 grappling clean jerks. I would have to agree really. I don't actually think clean jerks are bad for your spine
01:57:18.96 --> 01:57:20.000 I think they're good for your spine
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:21.60 But grappling
01:57:21.60 --> 01:57:27.28 You actually that's see this is the delve into how you get your information for your little books
01:57:27.28 --> 01:57:33.20 Right? Oh yeah, you sent me a text whatever a two years ago. Hey if a guy was in Virginia
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:35.20 One to train with like the best
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:37.36 On the east coast
01:57:37.36 --> 01:57:41.84 Where were we going train? You help you send me that text. I'm like send the hands
01:57:41.84 --> 01:57:44.96 Okay, sure did you got right back to me. I appreciate it
01:57:45.36 --> 01:57:49.68 And went right in the book. That's these guys just research you've ever done. Oh, it's great
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:51.20 It's Draco perfect
01:57:51.20 --> 01:57:53.20 Yep, and it made it right in the book and I moved on
01:57:53.44 --> 01:57:56.64 My little bad when people text me and I don't text them back like right away
01:57:57.36 --> 01:58:00.000 Oh really so you must feel real bad with me then
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.36 Yeah, I do the whole right away
01:58:01.36 --> 01:58:06.88 Hey, it's real foreign I mean, but sometimes it just doesn't like get it a lot of texts and like you got us at there and
01:58:06.88 --> 01:58:12.48 You know, but I try and text people back eventually or you might need to hit me with a little follow-up
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:14.48 or you'll follow up
01:58:15.20 --> 01:58:16.80 Well, hey um
01:58:16.80 --> 01:58:21.76 Well doing you just to impeeking at 95 stay in there is better than not picking to do so not
01:58:21.76 --> 01:58:26.80 We're about the kids were in it. Yeah, right away daughter in it from
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000 Oh, just in the game right now in
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.28 We are
01:58:31.28 --> 01:58:37.60 We're not so now we're in need to talk. Yeah, so she's in the snowboarding now in tennis
01:58:38.08 --> 01:58:43.84 So she turned 13. That's cool. Everything but I think age 11. I'm maybe 12 11. I think she might have stopped
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:46.48 kind of yeah
01:58:46.64 --> 01:58:48.64 It's tough. I was tough
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:50.64 Is there just to in Park City?
01:58:50.64 --> 01:58:54.16 I know there's full on just to and Utah you got Pedro's sour up there
01:58:54.48 --> 01:58:59.44 You got all kinds of good just to people up in Salt Lake City. Yeah, for sure. Yep. No, we sure do and there's one
01:58:59.44 --> 01:59:03.92 I think Pedro's sour has I think a little offsite in Park City may very lead
01:59:04.32 --> 01:59:06.40 So of course we checked it out before the move
01:59:06.88 --> 01:59:10.64 They've moved sand so I haven't followed where they moved to but I think there's one still there
01:59:11.44 --> 01:59:14.80 But because it was important to me because at the time we moved my daughter was still in it
01:59:14.80 --> 01:59:17.60 Our little guy was in it all right your old now at your old
01:59:18.48 --> 01:59:22.80 So it was important to me that there was due to where we were moving and but now that we moved
01:59:22.80 --> 01:59:26.80 I would get there and it's gone. It's just like an empty space. So I think it's still there somewhere
01:59:26.80 --> 01:59:29.44 But the kids I can't either doing their things unfortunately
01:59:31.44 --> 01:59:35.84 There's a lot to do lots to do up there but we know I dabble over the over the years was still doing it well
01:59:35.84 --> 01:59:40.56 I was an opso or NNX always but before I got out in Coronado because it was right there
01:59:40.56 --> 01:59:42.24 I go at lunch and roll with some guys
01:59:42.48 --> 01:59:48.16 I'll be some researching I think that where we can get you get you and your family back in the game up and so up in Park City
01:59:48.16 --> 01:59:54.16 Because I personally feel like guilty to have your family not training to have you not training
01:59:54.16 --> 01:59:58.16 You're taking some extreme ownership of your car
01:59:58.16 --> 02:00:00.64 You're taking some extreme ownership of that
02:00:00.64 --> 02:00:04.64 Rees needs to get in the game. Yeah, in the story. You know the fictionalized
02:00:05.20 --> 02:00:06.80 James Reese is on it
02:00:06.80 --> 02:00:11.36 Yeah, you said you got a get you know you talk about transferring those emotions right
02:00:11.92 --> 02:00:16.64 Real world. I remember how you never like to get you know just thrown around the mat
02:00:16.96 --> 02:00:20.96 The floor wiped with you know yeah, I was worried that's why didn't tell you I was coming in last night
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.60 I know I said it I didn't I was worried that I'd be up at three something getting just destroyed on the mat
02:00:27.60 --> 02:00:30.88 Here, yeah, we're just in the is out so you know

02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:17.92 But once every every four years like the Olympics
02:11:18.32 --> 02:11:22.48 Like the linear Olympics in Park City every four years a good video is gonna come out
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:26.32 Whatever Jack Car like some soap. I do I repost it down on
02:11:26.88 --> 02:11:28.88 Repost it we lie to ourselves
02:11:28.88 --> 02:11:33.28 Oh, there you go see things thanks for that by the way. All right. Also psycho a little warfare
02:11:33.92 --> 02:11:38.000 Go ahead. No, I'm giving it to you. I put your name there psychological warfare
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.72 You don't know what that is. This is what it is an album with tracks
02:11:40.72 --> 02:11:48.08 Jocco chat anyway. He tea on those tracks he tells you how to give through moments of weakness like if you're about to eat the wrong thing
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:53.20 Because for the short term because the short game long game you can't listen to this
02:11:53.44 --> 02:11:57.12 Oh, yeah, and it 100% works by the way. So if you're like okay, I'm gonna
02:11:57.68 --> 02:12:00.64 In life this is what I learned one of the biggest things people ask me this all time
02:12:01.20 --> 02:12:05.76 I would say literally anyone who has questions quote unquote for me. This is one of the questions they'll ask
02:12:05.76 --> 02:12:09.04 What's the biggest thing you learn from jocco? I'll tell you right now. Here it is
02:12:09.04 --> 02:12:11.04 If you look at things
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:16.80 Short term versus long term small picture big picture oh and then there's like another one
02:12:16.80 --> 02:12:23.44 Whatever, but either way, it's all the same thing short term so in psychological warfare if you're going short game if you're gonna start playing the short game for that moment
02:12:23.68 --> 02:12:26.48 This will if you're gonna lose the short game in the moment
02:12:27.04 --> 02:12:31.84 Yes, you're just any if you're gonna if you're gonna take a short term short term have immediate gratification
02:12:31.84 --> 02:12:36.24 But it's a long term down. Yes, exactly right and most of the time not all the time
02:12:36.24 --> 02:12:41.44 But most of the time short term if you play short short game you lose the long game with that play
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:47.84 It's like you take a short term step forward and take a long step back. It's one of those deals usually you can break things down into that
02:12:48.24 --> 02:12:53.76 So this what this does I'm getting that because I need to listen to that one my whole foods and I'm getting up there
02:12:53.76 --> 02:12:56.96 Ready to get to that register and they have those peanut butter cups
02:12:57.52 --> 02:12:59.52 All natural
02:12:59.52 --> 02:13:01.52 Natural that's okay
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:08.16 Exactly all that or is Reese's I'm gonna all natural heroine is all natural
02:13:10.48 --> 02:13:13.44 What are we doing over here? Yeah, let's get a listen to that as I'm checking out
02:13:13.44 --> 02:13:17.68 That's perfect actually because actually it's good because you can actually have it in the queue
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:22.32 You know because a lot of times like you just in the pantry wherever you are and you're like boom
02:13:22.32 --> 02:13:25.36 I'm looking for the good stuff that ever boom. I see the the Oreos
02:13:25.36 --> 02:13:31.28 Bro, my I can't just go let me queue it up sometimes it gets hard. It's a little bit bro my son. Okay
02:13:31.28 --> 02:13:34.72 Can drive now right which means he can go to the store?
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:39.92 Which means he can shop for food right? We're talking 16-year-old boy
02:13:40.56 --> 02:13:42.56 What does he get at the store?
02:13:42.56 --> 02:13:44.56 Just work
02:13:44.56 --> 02:13:46.56 Oh, he just gets crazy
02:13:46.56 --> 02:13:52.000 You know, so good he'll be like I'm hungry going to the store comes home. What does he come home with?
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000 Half gallon of whatever ice cream makes sense
02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.24 But because you know the supermarket's they they they formulate or they design
02:14:00.56 --> 02:14:05.28 Yeah, store in the product of certain way so like boom boom that's why they put the Reese's pin
02:14:05.28 --> 02:14:09.76 But right at the at the checkout. They call impulse buys right and that goes for everything little
02:14:10.32 --> 02:14:14.80 Machines and balloons and all that is that's their psychological warfare
02:14:14.80 --> 02:14:18.80 That's what it is. It's their psychological warfare. And you got combat that
02:14:18.80 --> 02:14:24.32 Yeah, with psychological warfare. Yeah, but thank you meet the flanking. Oh, I see
02:14:24.32 --> 02:14:28.08 Can I get a boy the aisle freaking away the aisle? Yeah, you can snack
02:14:28.08 --> 02:14:33.76 I'll you're not even gonna be check out but you got to check out and that's where they got them that's your weakness bro
02:14:34.32 --> 02:14:39.12 So good, but that's what your boy is essentially falling for when he goes in
02:14:40.32 --> 02:14:42.72 That's where you're wrong. He's going up there on the
02:14:42.72 --> 02:14:48.000 Yeah, he's going to his land. He's leaving the house and he's thinking the brothers
02:14:48.72 --> 02:14:50.72 Yeah, okay, that's what he's doing
02:14:51.76 --> 02:14:53.76 He goes and gets gays like
02:14:54.48 --> 02:15:01.52 The plan is actually honestly the ice cream thing is really taking a down hit at my house because malt right because everyone just kind of on the malt
02:15:01.52 --> 02:15:03.52 Yeah, but like but
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:07.92 My son will get straight up chocolate chip cookies just that's what he did last night

02:15:15.20 --> 02:15:18.64 Okay, where are you going? Oh, it's gonna move the store and he's only thinking about one thing
02:15:18.64 --> 02:15:20.64 He's not thinking about lettuce
02:15:21.36 --> 02:15:28.88 He's been thinking about apples he's thinking chocolate chip cookies coming back with the big chunks in them like the premium
02:15:28.88 --> 02:15:33.04 Yeah, and then the evil little kid brings him into my house

02:21:27.12 --> 02:21:33.92 I I experience this because I get to see it all the time with the companies we were like I see someone that's like really in the game and they're
02:21:34.32 --> 02:21:38.16 Sharp yeah, they're their their leadership is sharp and then all of a sudden
02:21:38.80 --> 02:21:41.92 They slack off for a while and they have a leadership problem and they handle it wrong
02:21:42.96 --> 02:21:47.84 Just like they couldn't match they couldn't do 42 pull-ups like they could before now they're doing 32
02:21:47.84 --> 02:21:53.20 Why they haven't been trained got to keep your leadership brain sharp you've been 40 to pull-ups
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:58.24 No like my mine was 30 something was my was my best I think still good man 30 something
02:21:58.24 --> 02:22:02.88 But in high school when I was very very light. I'm a two sets of 20. I still remember that was my thing
02:22:02.88 --> 02:22:05.68 Come on like two sets of two that's what's interesting
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:08.08 That was getting ready for bud essentially that was high school

02:22:13.92 --> 02:22:18.16 Was I was like bro, I did I did three sets of pull-ups today because we didn't know
02:22:18.16 --> 02:22:21.84 I think I didn't need to do 250 pull-ups for work out
02:22:22.40 --> 02:22:26.72 350 pull-ups work out. I didn't think of that it didn't even make sense to me right it was 19
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:33.04 It was 1989 1990 well it was there was no way to access this information
02:22:33.28 --> 02:22:37.12 No, so you're not going to be doing the same number of pull-ups as your class number. Yeah
02:22:37.68 --> 02:22:40.72 Yeah, how many that's what we're gonna do yeah, by the way
