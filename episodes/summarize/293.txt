This way, you're going to have a guy who's going to experiment Jiu-Jitsu, going to love the techniques, going to understand their strategy, and he's going to, he's going to lost weight, he's going to get fit, he's going to get, you know, confident on his knowledge, but not to prove all the time, not to be able to go and be a fighter or a competitor. and you can live like if you don't training breathing, it's like your biceps, it's like your, your, your strategy, your techniques, your, if you don't training the breathing system, you're going to work with 40% less the capacity, the capabilities to really refresh yourself, hyperventilate, bringing yourself to a next level of understanding because if you get tired, you don't know how to hyperventilate, you get tired in your mind, start to phase to fade a little bit, you start to making poor decisions, you start to get completely off your game because it's no oxygen enough for the brain and the, and the body. So, he going to love Jiu-Rou, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, for the bully, I'm going to give him, not only the knowledge of Jiu-Jitsu, but I'm going to put him to compete for him to start to respect others, and be more malo in the attitude. Yeah, I, I try and explain to people sometimes that when you do digits or the more digits or you do, you get to a point where you can kind to see the future because you know what this other person's going to do and when you know what they're going to do, you're can be their waiting for them because you know what they're going to do. I mean, even from that, from what Steve Bailey taught me, I probably got in, I don't know how many skirmishes, like fights, but put tune fights, you know, where you're fighting your friend, where you're not going to beat the shit out of them, but you're going to definitely figure out what's up, right? You also, you know, you hear, you mentioned that not only is corny and trying to control all this stuff, but he's also got guys like Hanzo coming in, who's, you know, a great teacher, you said, you said, Hanzo became a father figure two as younger brothers, half and high, and into many others. When you're dealing with this, you know you have UK Nikai coming up and you're basically telling, Hoyler, hey listen, I'm not going to hit him, you know, I'm going to be, I'm going to be as, do his little damage as I can. They said that I think might have been like in the documentary, whatever they were like, he wanted to kind of display you Jitsu with someone who was less physical, less, you know, bigger whatever that way. Well, you're not even going to paddle out, so, so that's like going to first day of jiu-jitsu, and there's, you know, a 220 pound 21 year old blue belt that's getting ready to crush the person that just showed up that wants to learn. And just one little example you said, there's sometimes in jutsu, you've got to calm down, you've got to remain calm, you've got to put in a bad spot, you've got to calm, you've got to relax, you've got to not panic, you've got to think your way through it, you've got to wait for your moment. That's a good one to stay to stay like kind of in the game as far as I like, hey, this is what like legitimate almost in a way redefined American manufacturing. Yeah, that's, it seems like in jujitsu, when, when you have jujitsu like that, it's the situation where like you said somebody that's smaller and weaker can defeat someone that's bigger and stronger. When I grabbed the single on him and he was like, you know, go ahead and I started like trying to get a little, little uppity with that thing. And when I arrived, I decided to lay down on the floor on top of a carpet and ask my brother, I kind of stayed like straight like this, and ask my brother to roll me in the carpet like a burrito. Now, you get this sort of side of the martial arts family growing up training all the time, but you're also in Rio, which is a crazy place and the lifestyle that you had going on there, which you talk about here going to the book, Rio is like New York City in Bangkok combined. I'm always good to be a solid, you know, no matter if it's going, you know, if it's a good thing, if it's a wrong thing, I want to be part of and be trusted by my friends. I was a brand new guy, I was like, hey, I want to learn how to fight, and I also thought to myself, maybe I can teach the old man a little sum, because I'm pretty bad at myself, I just graduated from steel training, I'm pretty tough. You know, I'm going to read one last little section from the book, we're almost at three hours right now, so I'm going to read one little last section from the book. And I got to say, you know, people like think I'm a close-minded about, you know, nutrition or I'm close-minded about my habits. I feel like with the practice of jutsu, like you said, give you more awareness of the situation to be in, and the sense of applying the right action for the situation is based on reflexes, is based on practice, is based on preparation. My idea of the future for Jiu-Jitsu is to create a level in Jiu-Jitsu, where you experiment, the essential sensitivities, it's a sensory Jiu-Jitsu, you start to breathing, you start to feeling the leverage, you start to feeling the angles, you start to feel invisible power, you start to feel your connection, your reflexes, your defenses, for the sake of knowledge, for the sake of being proved, you have a chance, but at least for the first year of practice, you should not have an opponent, you should have only training partners. But he, that starts jujitsu for the first time, when I started jujitsu for the first time, you know, I was, like I said, I was 220 pounds, my first teacher was Fabio Santos. We didn't really talk about today, but it's a thing and I know it's a thing because, you know, when you're showing a move, like, let's say I'm showing a move with you. I was shocked because that was too long I snapped to my senses got mad on myself and easily submitted him afterward I realized that I never wanted to fight like this again because I was putting emotion before reason although nobody else realized that the time I learned an important lesson that day that it was a mistake to fight emotionally because emotions blinded me. It's their options because that's a lot of time in the question, where it's like, oh, I don't know what to choose and why and all this, they just kind of want to start. You know, so like even like the thing was that you're essentially controlling your base, right? So I felt like the same as you did so you cannot dissipate the motions based on the mechanics and the, and the tension and so you can capitalize basically always in some kind of mistake or some kind of lack of time or something like that. And the other, and the other, a academy is you've been protected for a month or the second month, so you say, okay, now it's time for you to one hour class 45 minutes, okay, now you guys stop, let's keep rolling, you guys can roll, you can, so you protect somebody from rolling for one or two months, but in one point, you have to allow them to roll, right, and that drop off, you start from that point when you start to understand yourself as having to roll all the time, and that sometimes can be completely depressive for many. There's other times, something happens, you've got to go right now and jutsu, you start to identify that look, there's times where you've got to take a step back relax, you've got to be calm, and there's other times where you've got to be aggressive, you've got to make things happen right now. The whole comprehensive psychological approach that they had, because they, every once in a while, you'll hear about like, Quiler would tell us about it where he'd be like, yeah, if you, you know, if you lose your first tournament, you get 20 bucks. It would display you Jitsu a little bit better because if you went in and you're like this more athletic, either were like, oh well he's more of an athlete, so it doesn't really highlight the Jitsu part of it. So I didn't know what's really represented that kind of statement, but I felt like my dad is not going to be upset. But you know, okay, you know, when you get into like a routine, working out training, you don't feel domes as much. Yeah, that's, you know, you were talking about what is successful people having common, they get, they can, they have an open mind, they overcon obstacles, they use the right strategies at the right times, they're comfortable in these uncomfortable positions and situations and these are all things that you can learn if you're a good. I think if it's part of your routine, you're going to be, you're going to be, you're going to read way more benefits over time. Yes, similar to chess, chess game, you know, if you play a guy who's a champion, he's already know what you're going to, when you move a piece, he knows five or ten movements ahead This is something that I connected the dots on a few years ago because people would ask me, I would say, listen, when things are going bad, you have to stay calm, you have to learn how to control your emotions and don't get all excited about something which things are going wrong. And I was like, okay, you know, cool, you know, I'm thinking, of course, what am I thinking? But if I have to fight one, I'm going to have a nice jacket for the winter, I'm going to have a lot of meat, a bear meat on my freeze and I'm going to have a nice necklace of bears too. And again, I mean, people have to buy the book to read through the details that you give, what it was like before the fight, what you were going through.
