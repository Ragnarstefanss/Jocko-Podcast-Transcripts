[00:00:00] This is jockel podcast number 184 with echo Charles and me
[00:00:05] Jockel willic good evening echo did evening
[00:00:08] It's been a while since we've done some Q&A and there's been a lot of questions
[00:00:14] So let's get into it ready to go into it. Okay question number one jockel
[00:00:20] I'm having issues
[00:00:22] Playing the game quote unquote at work. I'm quiet and friendly
[00:00:26] But I prefer to work hard rather than stand out in talk
[00:00:30] I found I have trouble forming more personal connections with my boss and co-workers
[00:00:36] What are your tips?
[00:00:40] So look when I talk about playing the game
[00:00:43] I'm not talking about the fact that you have to change your entire personality
[00:00:46] profile
[00:00:48] To start to connect with people that's not what I'm saying you don't have to go from being someone that's
[00:00:53] What they say quiet and friendly you don't have to become some chatty extraver
[00:00:59] Run it around making small talk with anybody and
[00:01:03] On top of that there's a little bit of a statement here that says you know
[00:01:08] I'd rather work hard as if
[00:01:11] There's these are mutually exclusive things which they are certainly not
[00:01:15] So this being forming relationships with people and playing the game does not interfere with your work at all
[00:01:21] Not saying that you sit around and talk when there's work to be done
[00:01:25] but
[00:01:27] There's gonna be natural breaks in whatever you're doing
[00:01:31] There's gonna be moments where skip the action pauses and you get a chance to connect with somebody
[00:01:36] So that's fine. So so what are some tips?
[00:01:40] That how would you do this?
[00:01:42] So I thought about this
[00:01:44] of
[00:01:46] You want to start with something small right?
[00:01:47] But you want to engage this is the key point. I don't just want to throw something at you
[00:01:52] I don't want to talk at you and besides
[00:01:56] when
[00:01:57] It's much easier just to let someone talk about themselves
[00:02:01] So the what I'm what my advice in this particular question is is to
[00:02:07] Tell them
[00:02:08] Something about yourself like something minor about yourself
[00:02:11] But then that kind of ties into something that you can ask them
[00:02:15] And then they can talk to you because most people like to talk about themselves
[00:02:20] So you ask them a question about themselves
[00:02:23] And then you go so you know something something
[00:02:26] Maybe something slightly related to work so it's not just some random
[00:02:30] Statement that you're making you know you say you know what we did it?
[00:02:34] Yesterday at work you reminded me of
[00:02:39] Something right it reminded me of something else and then
[00:02:42] Maybe it reminded me of a movie
[00:02:45] You know what we were doing yesterday reminding me of this movie have you seen that movie?
[00:02:49] And at least you're gonna get well no because I don't watch a lot of movies or no I haven't seen that movie or
[00:02:55] Oh, I've seen that movie. We've just a popular movie but you know what I mean?
[00:02:58] And all of a sudden you've got a little bit of
[00:03:01] Conversation going and that's all we're looking for
[00:03:04] We're not looking to turn into like chatty caddy
[00:03:07] We're just trying to build
[00:03:09] Build relationships with people so you know who they are so they they know who you are
[00:03:13] That's what we're talking about now think crazy start small build from there
[00:03:19] Pretty straightforward yeah and and through that building process what I kind of found is one
[00:03:26] And I guess maybe this is a little tactical thing you can kind of throw out whenever but you know
[00:03:30] And you know when people
[00:03:32] Give you advice or they tell you something about themself that something I don't know whatever whatever the story is right
[00:03:37] And maybe some strategy they use to do XYZ can be super small
[00:03:41] If you let them know that you remembered like in the future later on when you see me again you say I remembered what you said
[00:03:48] Last week, you know, tired in this yeah and just say you are all the
[00:03:53] Can be the smallest of that purple belt to jitsu mental jiu jitsu I like it
[00:03:58] It can be the smallest thing and it just makes you feel good so that that person will just
[00:04:04] Essentially feel more open with you like oh my gosh
[00:04:11] Oh yeah make some feel value ball that stuff just on that small level, you know, so as far as building little
[00:04:18] I'd say that's a cool thing to kind of remember to do if he can't I'd say that's a cool kind of thing to remember to
[00:04:23] All right, thank you
[00:04:26] Next question joko me I asked your advice for addressing a cowboy quote. I'm quote mentality among
[00:04:32] Teams working in dangerous environments how would you shift the culture to kill complacency to aggressively identify and mitigate risk
[00:04:41] As a point of professional pride
[00:04:44] Okay
[00:04:46] This is something that we'll definitely saw in the seal team seat all the time in the civilian sector
[00:04:51] You know construction companies power companies companies where people are doing dangerous work right
[00:04:56] Policeing fire finding anything anything that has any element of danger you you definitely see this and and
[00:05:03] Like I said certainly so on the seal teams and the answer to this is a comedy answer for many leadership situations is you have to explain why
[00:05:11] So let me put it in a little context what you have to do is you have to say hey let me explain to you what happens
[00:05:18] When someone gets hurt or injured on this job. Okay first of all we get the loss of that person on the job
[00:05:24] The job that we're working on the project that we're working on it falls back
[00:05:29] There's paperwork that has to be filed which by the way the paperwork hurts the progress of our project as well
[00:05:34] Our budgets impacted because now we got to bring someone else on board we got to trade him
[00:05:38] We we take a reputational hit as a company
[00:05:43] Right what what kind of what kind of a company can't do a job without getting someone hurt right
[00:05:49] I'm gonna this isn't a high bar it's not a very high bar to say hey can you complete this task without getting someone injured
[00:05:58] Yeah, and all of a sudden we got a we got a we got a hey you know in our company
[00:06:01] We don't we get a lot of people hurt well. What does that tell you about the company?
[00:06:04] It's a reputational hit who are you gonna hire you're not gonna hire the one that's got people getting hurt all the time
[00:06:09] So there's that
[00:06:12] And what does that do what does that do to your reputation in terms of everything else because if you're gonna
[00:06:17] A bunch of people hurt how can I expect you to keep your timelines how can I expect you to stay on budget so
[00:06:26] It's those things it's those that kind of reputation that you get
[00:06:31] If you are getting people hurt and then also
[00:06:34] What does it do what does it say about your team if you got people getting hurt and again?
[00:06:39] This is what I'm talking about as a conversation that you're having with the group with the team
[00:06:43] You're saying look what kind of a team are we if we got people getting hurt?
[00:06:46] What does that say about us? It says where lack lacks of musical it says we're complacent it says we don't pay attention
[00:06:52] What does it say about our leadership
[00:06:54] If we got guys getting hurt what does that say about our leadership?
[00:06:57] Says we don't care about our people which by the way says we don't care about our people
[00:07:00] It means says we don't care about our job
[00:07:02] It says we don't care about our reputation says we don't we just don't damn care
[00:07:07] And what does it say about you the individual?
[00:07:10] Well, you know what it says about you an individual.
[00:07:13] If you get hurt, you know what it says about you,
[00:07:15] you're a knucklehead and you got hurt.
[00:07:17] You couldn't follow the procedures.
[00:07:18] You didn't follow the procedures.
[00:07:19] You thought you were smart and you got complacent.
[00:07:21] Now you got hurt.
[00:07:23] So these are the things.
[00:07:26] When I talk about explaining why those are where I'm gonna start
[00:07:31] and now I'm gonna explain and connect the dots
[00:07:34] so that the person the individual see
[00:07:36] that someone getting hurt is actually the least professional
[00:07:42] thing that you can do from a leadership perspective.
[00:07:45] If I let one of my guys get hurt,
[00:07:46] that's just that's just
[00:07:49] the least professional thing I can do from an individual
[00:07:52] contributor perspective.
[00:07:54] If I'm getting hurt, guess what?
[00:07:56] I didn't follow, but you just,
[00:07:58] okay, look, are there accidents that happened yesterday?
[00:08:00] But what I'm saying is if you got an accident
[00:08:02] that could have been prevented that should have been prevented
[00:08:05] and I as an individual let it happen,
[00:08:07] that is absolutely my fault.
[00:08:09] It's like when you got a guy getting ready for an MMA fight
[00:08:11] and they get cut, they weren't wearing head gear
[00:08:15] and it's like, look, I get it, but that was dumb.
[00:08:20] And I've had that happen.
[00:08:21] I mean, I've had it happen with my fighters.
[00:08:23] I've seen it happen all kinds of happens
[00:08:24] and you have to see all the time, right?
[00:08:26] You've got to fight coming up.
[00:08:28] You're gonna fight for the title.
[00:08:30] For the UFC title, you're gonna make possibly millions of dollars.
[00:08:34] You're gonna be the champion of the world.
[00:08:36] Oh, two weeks out, got a cut, got a cut on my head,
[00:08:40] you had a bad, you know, boo out my ACL,
[00:08:43] doing take down the fence, right?
[00:08:46] Look, I get an accident's happened,
[00:08:47] but what was really happening right at that moment?
[00:08:49] Was it a random accident or we were doing something
[00:08:51] that we shouldn't have been doing?
[00:08:53] So if we start to lean towards look,
[00:08:56] having accidents is actually an unprofessional thing to do.
[00:09:01] It's a weak thing to do.
[00:09:03] It's a bad thing to do.
[00:09:05] When we let it happen, it hurts everyone,
[00:09:07] not just the individual involved.
[00:09:09] That's the attitude that we kind of come with.
[00:09:13] You know, I had the, in the Navy, you have like alcohol programs.
[00:09:21] So, hey, this is our program for, you know,
[00:09:24] alcohol, here's how we're trying to combat
[00:09:26] having the people have alcohol related incident.
[00:09:29] And when I was a trade-it, they had
[00:09:31] someone come in to like give us a talk about alcohol.
[00:09:36] And then when they got done, the guy says,
[00:09:40] okay, you know, sir, I was the guy in charge of you
[00:09:42] is what's your alcohol policy?
[00:09:46] And I didn't have one.
[00:09:48] And I didn't have one.
[00:09:49] And I was like, okay, hey, cool, I'll come up with one.
[00:09:52] Here's the alcohol policy.
[00:09:54] If you get hurt, or sorry, if you get drunk
[00:09:58] and you can't, if you get drunk and you get in trouble
[00:10:02] or you get in a fight or you get arrested
[00:10:03] or you get a DUI and you take time away
[00:10:06] from being deployable, you are doing
[00:10:09] alchitis job for them.
[00:10:11] There's the alcohol policy.
[00:10:14] So now, Alvison, it's not like, hey, cool,
[00:10:16] we're like, yeah, raw raw.
[00:10:20] No, Alvison, hey, man, do we want to help the enemy
[00:10:23] by taking ourselves off the battlefield?
[00:10:26] There's nothing more that Alchitis wants
[00:10:28] than for this seal to be arrested for DUI and non-deployable.
[00:10:34] You just did Alchitis job for you.
[00:10:36] So that's the kind of thing that I'm gonna build
[00:10:40] the culture around.
[00:10:42] And that's the same thing you can do with people
[00:10:43] that have that cowboy mentality.
[00:10:45] You shift it so that that cowboy mentality
[00:10:48] becomes the thing that hurts our reputation,
[00:10:50] that hurts our, that hurts the company reputation
[00:10:53] and it hurts our individual personal reputation.
[00:10:56] As a man, I couldn't even prevent my shift
[00:11:03] from getting, from having someone get injured.
[00:11:06] So that's what I do.
[00:11:07] You know, like it feeds into their professional pride,
[00:11:10] especially when you use the word unprofessional.
[00:11:13] No, yeah.
[00:11:14] You know, like a man's to be that, yeah, man,
[00:11:16] I knew you knew what you're doing on that one.
[00:11:18] And then on the flip side, if you say consummate professional,
[00:11:22] right?
[00:11:23] Ooh, that's a good one.
[00:11:23] If you're, man, you could do,
[00:11:26] it doesn't even matter the job.
[00:11:27] You can, you can have your own lawn mowing business
[00:11:31] when you're 13 years old.
[00:11:33] If someone says, hey, that guy,
[00:11:35] that kid's a consummate professional,
[00:11:37] you're like, hell yeah.
[00:11:38] Hell yeah.
[00:11:39] I'm gonna have to push back a little bit.
[00:11:41] I don't know if there's two people,
[00:11:43] I don't know if there's two many situations where you would say
[00:11:45] a 13 year old lawn mower.
[00:11:47] Now we know that Mark, the way that we're here kid
[00:11:49] is heavily involved in lawn mowing
[00:11:51] with Mark's meticulous mowing.
[00:11:52] Yes, yes, sir.
[00:11:53] But even, I don't even know if I'd call him a consummate professional,
[00:11:58] I wouldn't either, but if you were to work in the yard,
[00:12:02] if you were to do so, Mark would feel really good.
[00:12:04] If you said, yes, what I'm saying is you can't be
[00:12:06] just throwing words around.
[00:12:07] Yeah, that's okay.
[00:12:08] You can't just throw around consummate professional
[00:12:10] about lawn mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing mowing.
[00:12:12] But now let's say the guy was a greenskeeper,
[00:12:15] like on a golf course.
[00:12:16] Now that person could be a consummate professional,
[00:12:19] because he's got to dial stuff.
[00:12:20] And then maybe I guess you get to a certain level
[00:12:23] of just straight landscaping, where, oh, you know what?
[00:12:26] There was a water, there was the pipe exploded.
[00:12:29] Oh, Jockel came in.
[00:12:31] He had that whole thing resorted, receded,
[00:12:34] took him four hours.
[00:12:35] That guy is a consummate professional.
[00:12:38] So I guess I'll take it back.
[00:12:39] Well, I'm just saying, reserve it, reserve it.
[00:12:41] Don't play with it, yeah.
[00:12:42] Don't play with it.
[00:12:43] Fine, that thing around.
[00:12:44] Yeah, exactly right.
[00:12:46] Makes sense.
[00:12:47] Well, the, the draft man that that was very clever
[00:12:53] on your part.
[00:12:54] What was it?
[00:12:55] When you said you're doing okay, does job for you?
[00:12:57] Because think about it.
[00:12:58] I mean, you know, there's nothing worse for a guy
[00:13:01] in the military.
[00:13:02] Your personal right is you are actually helping the enemy
[00:13:05] right now.
[00:13:06] Yeah.
[00:13:07] And then how you say it, like you name names, you know?
[00:13:09] It's not like you said the enemy, which I get,
[00:13:11] that's good too.
[00:13:11] But it's way better to be like you're doing
[00:13:13] and you name the, because JPU will say that too, right?
[00:13:16] Where he'll be like, um, there was a sign or something
[00:13:19] about a sign or maybe he'll just say it.
[00:13:20] He'll be like, you're, your enemy thinks you for not
[00:13:22] giving 100% today.
[00:13:23] Yeah.
[00:13:23] Right.
[00:13:23] Remember that one?
[00:13:24] And it's good.
[00:13:25] That's a good one.
[00:13:25] And it sounds cool too.
[00:13:26] I get it.
[00:13:27] But it is real general.
[00:13:29] So you hear that 10 times or every day or whatever.
[00:13:32] Like, okay, cool.
[00:13:32] It sounds cool, but it won't really affect your
[00:13:35] professional pride all the time.
[00:13:37] Sometimes it doesn't.
[00:13:38] But if you name the enemy, you know, like if you have
[00:13:41] some adversary, you know, and they thank you that person
[00:13:44] whatever, John Smith, you know,
[00:13:46] for not giving 100, you know, you might feed into you.
[00:13:49] So you say in Al Qaeda, thanks you, you know,
[00:13:51] for getting arrested.
[00:13:52] Some like, amen.
[00:13:53] Think about it from the flip side, right?
[00:13:55] What if you think of like an Al Qaeda fighting team, right?
[00:13:59] And one of them gets cut like one of their effective
[00:14:03] fighters gets caught.
[00:14:04] I don't know, doing something that they don't like gambling.
[00:14:07] Going to strip club.
[00:14:08] I don't know.
[00:14:08] Whatever.
[00:14:09] And they say, hey, you're not allowed to fight anymore
[00:14:11] for us.
[00:14:12] So he gets like exiled or whatever.
[00:14:14] Oh, that's sweet. We want them to do that.
[00:14:17] We might have to send them some strip of recommendation.
[00:14:20] You see what I'm saying?
[00:14:21] So it's literally, he's you're literally doing that.
[00:14:23] Yeah.
[00:14:23] Literally.
[00:14:25] Yeah, that's good.
[00:14:26] Jerk.
[00:14:27] Jerk.
[00:14:28] You clever.
[00:14:29] Clever.
[00:14:29] Good.
[00:14:30] Shh.
[00:14:31] Shh.
[00:14:33] All right.
[00:14:34] Next question.
[00:14:35] Hi, Jockel.
[00:14:36] You answered a question about complainers and said you would
[00:14:39] listen to the because, well, it should be
[00:14:42] listen to them.
[00:14:43] Yeah. You said you would listen to them because you
[00:14:45] can learn what the problems are.
[00:14:48] I like it.
[00:14:49] And people like to be heard.
[00:14:50] But how do you handle chronic complainers?
[00:14:53] The type of people who become cancerous,
[00:14:55] a meat fanics of extreme ownership should take.
[00:14:58] Thanks for your time.
[00:15:00] Yeah, this is a cause once again for my favorite.
[00:15:04] My favorite general remedy in leadership situations
[00:15:09] is you take this person and you put him in charge.
[00:15:11] Put him in charge?
[00:15:12] Yeah.
[00:15:13] And this is one of those classic things where someone says,
[00:15:15] hey, why are we even doing it this way?
[00:15:18] And you say, oh, echo, you don't like that cool.
[00:15:20] Why don't you come up with a plan and you go execute it?
[00:15:21] How do you want?
[00:15:23] Yeah.
[00:15:24] And that does one or two things either they say, OK.
[00:15:28] And they step up and then they have to figure out how hard the
[00:15:30] job the task is and they have to get it done.
[00:15:33] And it's they learn from it and they get humbled by it.
[00:15:36] And they recognize the the the burden of responsibility that
[00:15:41] a leader actually has, which is all good or they just say, no, no,
[00:15:45] and they stop playing because they don't want to get
[00:15:46] tested.
[00:15:47] Now, what what you got to be careful with it,
[00:15:50] all these answers that I give, you could go like in the wrong direction.
[00:15:58] So what I mean by that is echo says, hey, I don't like
[00:16:01] we're doing the way we're doing this.
[00:16:02] And I go, OK, well, then you're in charge.
[00:16:04] Yeah.
[00:16:05] You know what I mean?
[00:16:06] I do it like that.
[00:16:07] It's a punishment.
[00:16:08] It's a punitive thing.
[00:16:09] And absolutely not what I'm talking about.
[00:16:11] I say, you know what echo?
[00:16:13] You're pointing out some good stuff.
[00:16:14] You're pointing out some definite shortfalls in the way that this is happening.
[00:16:18] I'll tell you what, why don't you actually just take responsibility for this
[00:16:21] and you can run this task and you can make this happen.
[00:16:23] Because I think, you know, just based on some of the things you've pointed
[00:16:26] out already, I mean, call them complaints.
[00:16:28] Based on some of the things you pointed out already, I think you could
[00:16:30] probably improve upon our process quite a bit.
[00:16:34] So you got to be careful.
[00:16:35] I'm not talking about being a jerk to someone.
[00:16:38] Yeah.
[00:16:38] I'm talking about action.
[00:16:40] And this is the thing.
[00:16:41] It's like there's this thing.
[00:16:45] Well, what I'm doing, I'm not just playing the game.
[00:16:49] Have I ever told this in GJJ?
[00:16:50] I'm like, hey, if you want to set me up with the choke so that you can get my arm,
[00:16:56] you have to actually do the choke.
[00:16:58] You have to actually apply the pressure.
[00:17:00] If you know to apply the pressure, I'm not defending it.
[00:17:01] My arm's not going to go where you want it.
[00:17:02] You have to actually do it.
[00:17:04] And if I don't defend it the way you expect me to, then you just choke me.
[00:17:08] It's the same thing here.
[00:17:09] I'm not saying you just say, well, what don't you do with that?
[00:17:11] No, you have to actually say, hey, listen, I think this is what's going on.
[00:17:16] I think you have some good points.
[00:17:18] Why don't you take lead on this and we'll see if you can remedy this situation.
[00:17:23] Because I think you've got a pretty good chance of doing it.
[00:17:25] This isn't, I'm not doing this as a punitive thing.
[00:17:27] I'm doing it because it's the best thing for the team.
[00:17:29] You've got a legitimate complaint.
[00:17:30] You've got a bunch of them.
[00:17:32] Let's get you in a position where you can sort some of those things out.
[00:17:36] So yeah, so that's that.
[00:17:40] We can get people that are complaining, you know, first of all, hear them out.
[00:17:43] And maybe that's good enough, right?
[00:17:45] Hey, listen to them.
[00:17:47] And once again, I'm not saying you listen to them while your brain is elsewhere and you're
[00:17:51] not thinking, are you actually listening what they're saying?
[00:17:53] You're engaged.
[00:17:54] You really do go for the choke.
[00:17:56] Go for it.
[00:17:57] Listen to what they're saying.
[00:17:58] Maybe there's some solutions you can come up with.
[00:18:00] But then if that doesn't work and even after they even after you listen to them and
[00:18:03] you explain to them why things aren't the way they want, they still want to complain
[00:18:07] it.
[00:18:08] Complain about it.
[00:18:09] Cool.
[00:18:10] That's fine.
[00:18:11] Awesome.
[00:18:12] You take lead on this and that way you can sort out some of these issues.
[00:18:13] Appreciate it.
[00:18:14] Kind of like Leipzig, that one time is kind of hard to complain about a plan when it's
[00:18:18] your plan.
[00:18:19] Yeah, that is the truth.
[00:18:20] Yeah, makes sense.
[00:18:21] God, I'm so stupid.
[00:18:23] Yeah, let's get in sucks that I came up with.
[00:18:27] Yeah, the chronic complaining because you could kind of, I mean, people complain a lot.
[00:18:37] It's easy to be like, oh, they're chronic complainers.
[00:18:41] But if there's constantly, we'll say chronic problems that might induce chronic complaining.
[00:18:46] I'm not saying that's the case.
[00:18:47] Obviously because I know that there is.
[00:18:49] So it's doing this chronic complainers 100%.
[00:18:53] But at the very least, like I say, oh, yeah, I put them in charge of something or
[00:18:56] listen to them and they'll point, listen to what they're complaining about or whatever.
[00:19:00] You might actually get turned on to all these solvable problems.
[00:19:05] And if you make someone take lead in a situation and it's kind of like that concept of
[00:19:12] taking an extreme ownership and then what if they do like say, yeah, it is your fault.
[00:19:16] And then you get all mad.
[00:19:17] You know, kind of thing is like, oh, you didn't really do that.
[00:19:20] It's like, so if you put someone else in charge of something, you're really putting
[00:19:23] them in charge.
[00:19:24] But if they run, what if they take lead and they solve all the problems?
[00:19:27] And they don't awesome, right?
[00:19:28] Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:29] So you don't treat this action or this discourse as like something to get back at the
[00:19:34] complaint.
[00:19:35] It's not just a setup.
[00:19:36] It's a real move.
[00:19:37] It's a real deal.
[00:19:39] And you know, that's, you just made this point that I made, which is one of the best leadership
[00:19:50] tools that is completely overlooked by people all the time.
[00:19:53] This is very, very simple to do.
[00:19:55] And that's just to listen to what people are saying.
[00:19:59] I know it sounds crazy, but I run into all the time, leaders in all kinds of levels,
[00:20:04] all kinds of situations.
[00:20:05] And the biggest problem they have is they don't even listen to anyone else.
[00:20:08] They won't listen.
[00:20:09] Yeah.
[00:20:10] So when you're in a leadership position, try this.
[00:20:14] Be quiet and listen to what people are saying.
[00:20:16] Listen to what they're complaining about.
[00:20:18] Listen to what suggestions they have.
[00:20:20] Listen to what advice they give.
[00:20:22] Listen to their recommendations.
[00:20:24] Listen, just listen sometimes.
[00:20:27] You're going to be in a much better spot.
[00:20:29] Yeah.
[00:20:30] And even like you saying that out loud sounds real obvious, you know?
[00:20:32] But it's, man, it's not.
[00:20:34] Because even a lot of times, like if you don't listen, I'm thinking of myself, like all
[00:20:37] the many trillions, trillions of times that I haven't listened when I should have.
[00:20:44] Most of the time, most of the time we'll say, I don't mean to not listen.
[00:20:48] I don't mean to be like, it's not like I'm hearing noise and be like, oh, you don't
[00:20:53] know what you're talking about.
[00:20:54] You're dumb.
[00:20:55] You know, what you say doesn't mean anything.
[00:20:56] It's not that.
[00:20:57] It's more that I'm like, focus so hard on what I'm thinking or my way or whatever.
[00:21:02] Like I'm just so just, of course, naturally, it's my kind of thinking about it for years.
[00:21:06] No, you know, kind of thing.
[00:21:07] So I'm so, basically, dug into myself on my own thing that I'm not.
[00:21:12] And I'm just not paying attention that much.
[00:21:14] You know, I'm like working so hard and down this tunnel that I can't look out of the
[00:21:19] tunnel kind of thing.
[00:21:21] So you don't really mean to, but when you're in the situation, it's like, it's not that
[00:21:25] easy.
[00:21:26] It's, and you know what it is, also, it's a detachment.
[00:21:30] Right?
[00:21:31] Because when you're talking, you're talking.
[00:21:33] Yeah.
[00:21:34] And I've got to step back to touch.
[00:21:35] Listen to what people are saying.
[00:21:36] I do this all the time.
[00:21:37] I do this all the time.
[00:21:38] It's such a, it's such an easy move.
[00:21:41] Yeah.
[00:21:42] If you remember, move, you just watch.
[00:21:44] You just listen, even like, can you just do you do this?
[00:21:47] You're like, oh, the person wants to move around a bunch.
[00:21:48] Cool.
[00:21:49] Let him move around a bunch.
[00:21:50] Let's see where they're going.
[00:21:51] I'm just going to listen to their moves.
[00:21:52] And that's a good way to put it, man.
[00:21:54] Just listen to their moves.
[00:21:56] Just listen.
[00:21:57] And yeah, if you primarily focus on that listening, then like you have to be able to do it
[00:22:02] way better.
[00:22:03] Because like, again, like back to the, it's not like, you're not doing it with malicious intent.
[00:22:08] You know, you're not shutting them down.
[00:22:10] It's almost like every, you like, interruptors, right?
[00:22:12] You know, chronic interruptors.
[00:22:13] Yes.
[00:22:14] So the time, some of the time, a lot of time, whatever.
[00:22:17] We'll say half of the time estimate there.
[00:22:19] It doesn't feel like they're doing it because they don't want to hear what you have to
[00:22:22] say.
[00:22:23] Sometimes it's that for sure.
[00:22:24] But sometimes, it's almost like, it's almost like they have this tone of like
[00:22:28] dang.
[00:22:29] I don't think I finished my point as good as I wanted to almost it's doing it for them for
[00:22:33] them for themselves.
[00:22:34] Because they're so committed to their message and what they've been thinking
[00:22:36] the whole time.
[00:22:37] And if you're not signing right onto it, it's man, I must not set it clear enough.
[00:22:41] You see, I'm saying I had to like tighten up my kid.
[00:22:44] It's on just straight.
[00:22:46] They just wouldn't let each other talk.
[00:22:48] It just interrupt interrupt interrupt.
[00:22:50] Yeah.
[00:22:51] I think it was, yeah, it was my son for sure.
[00:22:53] And he looked at me and he goes, he's like, he says, Dad, you and he just be a
[00:22:57] aggressive or whole wife.
[00:22:58] And now all of a sudden you're telling us just a sit back.
[00:23:00] That was funny.
[00:23:04] Did you tell him that that's the day economy?
[00:23:06] I said that's the day economy.
[00:23:07] I know he's gross.
[00:23:08] Yeah.
[00:23:09] All right.
[00:23:10] Next question.
[00:23:11] What is the most important issue?
[00:23:14] You've ever changed your mind about.
[00:23:21] This is, you know, this is one of those things where I'm, this is one of those questions
[00:23:26] where I should have like some answer about some specific subject or something.
[00:23:33] You know what I mean?
[00:23:34] Like I can see, I know what answer is desired.
[00:23:37] I know what type of answers is desired.
[00:23:39] But the reality is, you know, for me, to taking ownership of things, right?
[00:23:48] This wasn't really like I changed my mind to where, when I used to say, I'm going to blame
[00:23:54] everyone and then all of a sudden, you know what?
[00:23:56] That's not the right policy to have.
[00:23:57] I need to start to extreme ownership.
[00:23:59] I didn't do that.
[00:24:01] But it was just a thing that built and developed inside my brain.
[00:24:06] And I think it's the most important thing that I've ever sort of recognized or conclusion
[00:24:13] that I've come to.
[00:24:14] That's not a change.
[00:24:15] But I'm sure at some point my attitude wasn't like I'll just take ownership of that.
[00:24:20] Which is now.
[00:24:21] But at some point, you know, I'd say, well, that's not really my responsibility.
[00:24:23] You know what I mean?
[00:24:24] Of course.
[00:24:25] No, that's a natural thing to say.
[00:24:28] And I'll tell you, well, the next, and this is interesting.
[00:24:32] But the other, and this one's kind of more of a, more of a, I can pin it down a little
[00:24:38] bit closer to an answer that someone would like.
[00:24:40] And this is, again, it's going to be a little bit, a little bit strange.
[00:24:46] But the other thing is the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:24:50] And this is the thing about the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:24:53] And I actually was thinking, I actually didn't really recognize this until the last
[00:24:57] master.
[00:24:58] I know, as I was thinking about the dichotomy of leadership, maybe it was off of a question.
[00:25:01] Maybe, I think it was actually before, no actually was before we even started.
[00:25:04] I was just like reviewing notes and thinking about the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:25:09] And one of the most important things about the dichotomy of leadership is that the reason,
[00:25:18] the reason that I came to the conclusion, the reason that I got to the dichotomy of
[00:25:22] leadership, we're in getting there.
[00:25:24] Let me rephrase that.
[00:25:25] In getting to a point where I said, there's a dichotomy of leadership, what I had to do
[00:25:30] was I had to admit to myself that I was wrong about everything.
[00:25:36] That's what I had to do.
[00:25:39] In order for the idea of the dichotomy of leadership to escape my brain, to get out,
[00:25:46] to become a full thought.
[00:25:49] What I had to do, I had to admit to myself that I was actually wrong about everything.
[00:25:56] So I'll give you real easy examples, one of my things that I used to tell guys all the
[00:26:00] time.
[00:26:01] You got to be aggressive.
[00:26:05] You got to be aggressive.
[00:26:06] That's how you got to be.
[00:26:07] In order for the dichotomy of leadership, I had to admit, you know what, sometimes being
[00:26:11] aggressive doesn't work.
[00:26:12] I used to say, you know what, as a leader, you got to stand up, you got to be loud.
[00:26:17] And then I realized you know what, there's I see leaders that are two.
[00:26:21] I didn't admit that I was wrong about that.
[00:26:23] That's sometimes that was wrong.
[00:26:25] I had to admit that I was wrong about keeping things simple.
[00:26:30] Like you know what, this is one of the most fundamental laws of combat.
[00:26:33] You got to keep things simple.
[00:26:34] And then I had to admit that sometimes people keep things too simple.
[00:26:40] Even this fact right here, right?
[00:26:42] In order to admit that I was wrong, I had to be humble.
[00:26:45] And I used to preach.
[00:26:46] And I still preach humility as being like the most important thing.
[00:26:49] But guess what?
[00:26:50] There are people.
[00:26:52] And there are even me with this, there's times and places where you can be too humble.
[00:27:00] And so this idea, this idea that there's dichotomy to everything, it's something that
[00:27:06] the original thought for me was, it came from me having one sided opinion and then realizing
[00:27:15] that, and I'm almost positive.
[00:27:17] I don't remember crystal clear, but I'm almost positive that the original thought that
[00:27:22] I realized there was a dichotomy to was being aggressive.
[00:27:27] And again, this was, this is all kind of coming to fruition as I'm teaching guys at
[00:27:32] trade at and life was running the junior officer training course.
[00:27:37] And I used to give them the soul.
[00:27:38] And I remember right and you know, I remember to say to myself, you know what, I got to tell
[00:27:41] guys that they can go too far with being aggressive and they can go too far with barking
[00:27:48] orders and they, and I just, it like that's where it came from.
[00:27:52] And if I wouldn't have been able to change my mind, right, because that's what this question
[00:27:58] was, changing my mind about something.
[00:28:00] The biggest thing probably ever in my life was understanding that just about every characteristic
[00:28:07] that a person can have, that a leader can have, can go too far and can become a negative
[00:28:12] characteristic.
[00:28:14] So that's probably the biggest thing that I've changed my mind on.
[00:28:18] Interesting.
[00:28:20] Yeah, that aggressive one that makes sense, because like, yeah, aggressive being aggressive
[00:28:26] like is one of the more effective ways to straight up, going to quote, get things done.
[00:28:30] First, right?
[00:28:31] Do it and it'll be done.
[00:28:32] Do it, you know.
[00:28:33] Don't wait.
[00:28:34] Don't hesitate.
[00:28:35] Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:36] Problem in a building, let's sit back and wait until that problem starts to know.
[00:28:40] Like you got to be aggressive.
[00:28:42] Yeah.
[00:28:43] But then if you're in judicial teaching, all kinds of lessons like this where if you're
[00:28:47] going to spring a trap on somebody or something, animal, person, whatever.
[00:28:52] What's the best type of person that you can catch with a trap?
[00:28:56] Probably an aggressive one, you know.
[00:28:59] Like they can set themselves up to get trapped if they're like aggressive.
[00:29:04] You know, like an animal who's wrong, you know.
[00:29:09] He's detaining like if an animal's like hesitant, you know.
[00:29:13] Just hesitant maybe sees things develop a little bit before they take a grab, you know,
[00:29:17] certain action or whatever, it'd be hard to detrap.
[00:29:19] Yeah.
[00:29:20] Yeah.
[00:29:21] And this is the thing that's, this is what makes humility important.
[00:29:28] It's hard to come to grips with the dichotomy of leadership because if you don't have
[00:29:34] the humility, do sometimes say, you know what, you're right.
[00:29:38] You know what, I'm wrong.
[00:29:39] Yeah.
[00:29:40] This plan isn't what I thought it should be.
[00:29:43] Yeah.
[00:29:44] It's so hard to do that.
[00:29:45] That's why it's hard to really get a grip on the dichotomy.
[00:29:48] Leadership and that's what makes it so important.
[00:29:49] That's what makes it the answer to so many questions.
[00:29:52] And sometimes people will come like, you know, someone will come up and say, they'll
[00:29:56] have their counterpoint to what I'm saying.
[00:30:01] And I'll tell you right now, let me think of a situation where you have to provide a
[00:30:07] counterpoint.
[00:30:08] If I, somebody comes to me and says, you know what, being aggressive isn't always
[00:30:12] good.
[00:30:13] Sometimes if you're aggressive, all you do is you run to your death.
[00:30:18] Now, an egotistical jacco would say negative, you're wrong.
[00:30:25] I'm right.
[00:30:26] And I would dig in in that position.
[00:30:30] And when you dig in and position, you can't maneuver anymore.
[00:30:32] So I'm actually stuck.
[00:30:34] So this is a classic thing to do.
[00:30:37] Also when I'm arguing with somebody, if you come to me and you say, I think we should
[00:30:42] do this, you know, method B.
[00:30:45] I say, I don't say no, because I think we should do a method A.
[00:30:48] That's what I think.
[00:30:49] And you think we should do a method B.
[00:30:50] You're going to be, I think we should do this method B.
[00:30:51] I think you're wrong.
[00:30:52] You know what I say?
[00:30:53] Okay.
[00:30:54] Well, I think you got some good points on method B.
[00:30:57] Oh, all of a sudden, you know, all of a sudden, we're in a totally different scenario.
[00:31:02] I just totally flipped the script on you.
[00:31:06] And I, you know what I say?
[00:31:07] I say, you know, some good points that you have.
[00:31:10] If you watch people debate, it's really a little slick move.
[00:31:16] But you don't see politicians do it, because they're so dug in, they can never think
[00:31:20] they're wrong.
[00:31:21] And they can never, and what they also are afraid of, they're afraid if they admit
[00:31:24] they're wrong about something.
[00:31:26] They look bad.
[00:31:28] Whereas if they said, you know what?
[00:31:29] That's a good point.
[00:31:31] That's actually a good point.
[00:31:32] I'm going to need to consider that.
[00:31:33] I've never really thought of that viewpoint before.
[00:31:35] You know what?
[00:31:36] I'm going to assess that.
[00:31:37] But I guess I think you got, I think there's some validity to what you just said.
[00:31:40] When's the last time you heard a politician say that?
[00:31:42] I don't, I don't think that.
[00:31:44] And then what happens is, and in this day and age, the supporters of that politician, they don't,
[00:31:52] they don't recognize the valid point either.
[00:31:55] It's just, no.
[00:31:57] No.
[00:31:58] So we get people that aren't thinking and it's very hard to hold dichotomies in your head
[00:32:05] that this can be right and that can be right.
[00:32:07] There's an aggressive approach and there's an on aggressive approach.
[00:32:09] There's an direct approach and there's an indirect approach and both of them can be functional.
[00:32:14] It's really hard to get a grip on that.
[00:32:17] And yet it's the answer to so many questions.
[00:32:20] It's the answer to the person, the subordinate that comes to you.
[00:32:24] And says, we should not be doing it this way.
[00:32:28] If your reaction isn't to diametrically opposed what they're saying, but instead to actually
[00:32:34] take their side and say, oh, I agree with you.
[00:32:36] You've got some really good points.
[00:32:38] Let's see how this would play out.
[00:32:40] Talk me through it.
[00:32:41] Yeah.
[00:32:42] You can't even, you're like, you can't even know.
[00:32:45] You know, it's like a move.
[00:32:47] It's like a jiu-jitsu move.
[00:32:50] And it works.
[00:32:51] Yeah.
[00:32:51] Yeah.
[00:32:54] So there's some things I've changed my mind on about.
[00:33:01] My mind is open though.
[00:33:03] I will change my mind if new evidence presents itself.
[00:33:07] I'll change my mind in the heartbeat.
[00:33:09] You go to do it.
[00:33:10] Present me with new evidence.
[00:33:12] What about like, well, I would think anyway after kind of thinking about it where, yeah,
[00:33:19] you, I think, I think generally speaking, we do kind of respect someone who can change their
[00:33:24] mind.
[00:33:25] And we all see it once people's digging into their opinion, you know, and saying all kinds
[00:33:29] of weird wacky stuff to try to defend yourself and yourself and you're like, it's not
[00:33:33] what we're talking about kind of thing.
[00:33:34] You see it clear.
[00:33:35] So like, it seems obvious like, yeah, you should change your mind.
[00:33:39] Or at least open up your mind and like I said, I'll give that some consideration.
[00:33:44] I'll look into it.
[00:33:45] And if you're right, shoot, I think you're right.
[00:33:47] I think that's a better way to do it or whatever, whatever the case is.
[00:33:51] But the, and then I guess technically this is a dichotomy too where you can't do that
[00:33:55] too much because if you're always changing your mind with, like, you know, like, like,
[00:33:59] I don't know, we'll see a politician.
[00:34:01] Yeah.
[00:34:02] Every time the opposing view or some other view comes in, you're like, hey, I didn't look
[00:34:06] at it like that.
[00:34:07] Or I didn't, maybe I'll look back and look into that more.
[00:34:09] We'll do it again.
[00:34:10] And again, and again, it's like, Brad, does this guy know anything?
[00:34:12] Because guess where you're talking about?
[00:34:15] What?
[00:34:16] There's a dichotomy.
[00:34:17] And if you go too far and you change your opinion all the time and then you become
[00:34:21] indecisive, and so that doesn't work.
[00:34:23] But if you're so, if you're the other side of this spectrum and you're completely dug in
[00:34:26] and you never change your mind, that doesn't work either.
[00:34:29] Where you need to do?
[00:34:29] What do you need to do?
[00:34:30] You need to balance the dichotomy between being flexible and inflexible.
[00:34:34] If you become ultra flexible, you're just going with whatever anyone's saying, that's
[00:34:38] not good.
[00:34:40] You need to find the middle ground.
[00:34:41] That's what dichotomy and leadership is.
[00:34:44] But it's hard for people to comprehend that.
[00:34:47] It's hard for people to see that where they draw that line.
[00:34:52] Yes, that's a thing for the general.
[00:34:54] I'll never change my opinion on this.
[00:34:57] Okay.
[00:34:58] You just told me where you stand.
[00:34:59] Yeah, I'm not sure I like that very much.
[00:35:01] Because new information can come to light.
[00:35:05] Yeah, that's where they stand in that dichotomy or whatever.
[00:35:10] Because I think part of it, and it's part of it is like, yeah, they don't want to be
[00:35:14] wishy-washy.
[00:35:16] But the other part, or the other part of that is, I'm saying if they always change their
[00:35:19] mind over there, so easily to be like, okay, maybe we'll do it.
[00:35:22] You're way, way to the farmer.
[00:35:23] Yeah, I think they come off like they don't know anything.
[00:35:26] For sure.
[00:35:27] So if you don't know anything, should you even be in that position?
[00:35:29] Like, I don't want you to be the congressman.
[00:35:32] If you don't know anything kind of thing, right?
[00:35:34] That's the feeling.
[00:35:35] So, and now with that, that's the feeling that people are trying to avoid when they
[00:35:40] dig in.
[00:35:41] They don't want to admit they're wrong.
[00:35:42] Because if I admit, I'm wrong.
[00:35:43] I didn't know.
[00:35:44] You know, kind of thing.
[00:35:45] So it's like, no, bro, you don't draw the line right there.
[00:35:48] You draw the line couple steps down the road.
[00:35:51] Be open a little bit.
[00:35:52] If you're somewhere to maneuver.
[00:35:53] Yeah, again.
[00:35:54] Yeah.
[00:35:55] I'm just going to maneuver.
[00:35:58] Next question.
[00:36:00] How does one detach when getting personally attacked and take extreme ownership with false
[00:36:06] claims?
[00:36:08] And what does one do when a subordinate always goes above the chain of command instead of
[00:36:12] working out issues with the code worker?
[00:36:15] Okay, this is in the clearest question that I've ever received.
[00:36:19] I'm going to try and, I'm not sure if I complete the understanding, but I'm going to try
[00:36:22] and sort of answer to the best of my ability.
[00:36:26] I think what we're talking about here is that someone is telling me that something
[00:36:29] gets my fault and that is a false claim.
[00:36:33] Is that, that's the question, right?
[00:36:35] I think you're making a false claim and saying, like, this is your responsibility,
[00:36:39] Marco, you were supposed to press record.
[00:36:43] And it's false because I wasn't supposed to press record.
[00:36:46] Yeah.
[00:36:47] Right, let's say.
[00:36:48] Yeah.
[00:36:49] Or maybe like, record was pressed.
[00:36:52] Like, there's no issue.
[00:36:54] You know?
[00:36:55] Well, then why would you, why would that become a personal attack?
[00:36:59] Yeah.
[00:37:00] I guess it wouldn't.
[00:37:01] So the personal attack is, Chaco, you didn't press record.
[00:37:05] And now the question is, what do I do then?
[00:37:07] Because we both know who's in charge of press record here.
[00:37:10] Yeah.
[00:37:11] Who is me?
[00:37:12] Okay, so you're in charge of press record.
[00:37:15] If you all of a sudden we are 40 minutes into a podcast and we haven't pressed record, the
[00:37:21] record has button has been pressed and all of a sudden it comes to light.
[00:37:26] And you say, Chaco, you didn't press record.
[00:37:29] Now what this person is saying, that's a false claim.
[00:37:32] Gotcha.
[00:37:33] That's not my responsibility.
[00:37:34] It's truly not my responsibility.
[00:37:35] I'm not going to actually, I should I be doing that.
[00:37:38] And you know what I'm going to say?
[00:37:40] You know what I'm going to say.
[00:37:41] Yes, right, too.
[00:37:42] Which is, you know what?
[00:37:43] It is my responsibility.
[00:37:45] Because I'm here.
[00:37:46] It's primarily my voice that's being recorded.
[00:37:49] And from now on, I will make sure that it's recorded.
[00:37:51] It's my fault.
[00:37:52] I will take care of it from now on.
[00:37:54] By the way, now what is your job responsibilities in this whole podcast?
[00:37:58] Nothing.
[00:37:59] Nothing.
[00:38:00] You have nothing to do.
[00:38:02] If you're not pressing record, you're not nothing to do.
[00:38:05] So how does that feel?
[00:38:06] It doesn't feel good.
[00:38:07] It doesn't feel good.
[00:38:08] You don't like that.
[00:38:09] But when I take away that responsibility, you're actually going to come and claw back
[00:38:11] from me.
[00:38:12] You're going to say, you know what?
[00:38:14] Actually, you know, it was your fault when that happened.
[00:38:17] But you know what, from now on, since you screwed it up, I'm going to take ownership
[00:38:20] of it.
[00:38:21] And you know what I say?
[00:38:22] I say, cool, that's awesome.
[00:38:23] Yeah, good point.
[00:38:24] Since you are over there with the recordings and your technical guy and I'm not.
[00:38:27] That makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:28] Why don't we go with that from now on?
[00:38:29] You own it.
[00:38:31] I shouldn't have dropped the ball last time.
[00:38:34] You know.
[00:38:36] So that's that.
[00:38:37] So there we go.
[00:38:38] I don't want it.
[00:38:39] I fix it.
[00:38:40] By the way, if you don't want responsibility back, if you just say, cool, yeah, you
[00:38:42] press a quarter from now on.
[00:38:43] Okay, cool.
[00:38:44] I will.
[00:38:45] And then guess what?
[00:38:46] I'll start thinking about how much I need you around here.
[00:38:49] Because really, what else do you bring to the table?
[00:38:51] And it'll be.
[00:38:52] All right.
[00:38:53] So that's question number one.
[00:38:58] The question number two, as far as detaching.
[00:39:00] So I don't get emotional.
[00:39:01] If someone is blaming me, if someone is blaming me, if you start blaming me for something,
[00:39:10] I actually look at that right on the gate.
[00:39:12] I see that it's a psychological victory for me.
[00:39:14] Because you're blaming me.
[00:39:16] Like you're blaming.
[00:39:17] You're not taking ownership.
[00:39:18] I already won.
[00:39:19] I already won.
[00:39:20] So there's no, I'm not getting emotional about that.
[00:39:22] That's their blaming me because they don't have the where we fall to actually take
[00:39:28] ownership themselves.
[00:39:29] I see that as a weakness of theirs and I'm fine with it.
[00:39:32] And that's why I'm not going to, I don't need to get emotional because I'm sitting there going
[00:39:36] wow, this person just served me up on a silver platter.
[00:39:38] The fact that they don't want to take ownership, I'm not going to give it to me.
[00:39:41] Are you kidding me?
[00:39:42] I'll take this all day long.
[00:39:44] Another thing is, and I've said this before, I can't be respect.
[00:39:48] I can't be disrespected by someone that doesn't even respect themselves.
[00:39:52] You know what I'm saying?
[00:39:53] You can't just respect me.
[00:39:56] If you don't even respect yourself, if you're just like a bum in the street,
[00:39:59] where the thing came from, you know, someone that's just a drunk bum laying in his own vomit
[00:40:07] and wants to, you know, look at me and say, you look like a dirt bag.
[00:40:12] Yeah.
[00:40:13] Okay, I did carry on with your day.
[00:40:17] You're not going to affect me.
[00:40:18] So how in the same vein, how can I be disrespected by you when you tell me when you blame
[00:40:24] me for something when I realized what's happening right now is you don't even have
[00:40:27] enough respect for yourself to take ownership of something.
[00:40:30] This is just a wind.
[00:40:34] So that's the second part of it.
[00:40:35] And I think the third part of the question is a subordinate that goes up the chain of
[00:40:40] command, instead of working out the issues with the coworker, that's pretty pretty easy.
[00:40:45] I'm not going to solve those problems for you.
[00:40:46] Oh, you're going to problem down the chain of command with your coworker, your peer,
[00:40:51] and you guys aren't working it out, and you want me to solve your problem?
[00:40:54] No, you go figure it out and come back to me with the solution.
[00:40:58] Now I'll do that a couple of times if eventually they can't come up with a solution.
[00:41:00] Guess what I have?
[00:41:01] I have a problem.
[00:41:02] I have a real problem, and I will solve it, and they're not going to like my solution.
[00:41:06] Because it probably involves neither one of them being there anymore.
[00:41:10] Extreme case, but what I will do is I say, okay, come and read me the facts.
[00:41:14] You really want me to make a decision about this?
[00:41:16] Cool.
[00:41:17] I'll do it.
[00:41:18] But I always felt horrible.
[00:41:20] In fact, I don't even know if I ever did this.
[00:41:22] I'm going to my boss to make a decision about something that I should have agreed with my
[00:41:25] peer.
[00:41:26] Because you know what?
[00:41:27] I'd rather just, for me, I'd rather say, hey, you know what?
[00:41:29] You want to do it your way, echo fine.
[00:41:31] And you, let's go with it.
[00:41:32] It's close enough.
[00:41:34] You, oh, you want to take the lead?
[00:41:36] Cool.
[00:41:37] You take the lead.
[00:41:38] I'll support you.
[00:41:39] No problem.
[00:41:40] That's what I'm here for.
[00:41:41] I want the team to win.
[00:41:42] I know you're concerned about you, and I know that's fine.
[00:41:43] That's fine.
[00:41:44] I'm here for the team.
[00:41:45] So let's do it your way, so that it works out.
[00:41:48] Not going to my boss and complaining.
[00:41:51] That's just ridiculous.
[00:41:52] And then that's another one where I'm fit in.
[00:41:56] I don't think I've ever been in a corporate scenario, but it seems like that that's easy
[00:42:04] to see another people, you know?
[00:42:06] Like where, you know how like a situation where, yeah, let me let my subordinate take lead.
[00:42:12] It seems like that could be a solid, almost obvious answer for people.
[00:42:16] Yeah, except myself.
[00:42:17] You know, like I don't, I don't always point that in.
[00:42:20] Or, you know, I'm sure there's like people out there where it's like, oh, that this
[00:42:23] will solve probably a lot of your problems.
[00:42:25] Just look at it this way and do it and do that.
[00:42:28] You know, let one of your subordinates like take lead on the stuff.
[00:42:31] And I would predict, suppose that goes, that most people would be pretty surprised.
[00:42:39] Like, oh, yeah, I guess I should, I should do that, you know, at this point.
[00:42:45] So you're saying that's it.
[00:42:46] It's a pretty obvious solution once you hear it.
[00:42:48] Yeah.
[00:42:49] I think that's a difficult solution to actually execute because most people put in the situation.
[00:42:53] Don't remember it.
[00:42:54] Yeah, they don't remember to point it inwards.
[00:42:56] Yeah.
[00:42:57] Even like, literally you could be getting this advice like right now.
[00:43:01] You could be getting this advice.
[00:43:02] But hey, yeah, chocolate, that sounds like good advice and then no go like back to work.
[00:43:05] And you know, it applies to everyone else, you know?
[00:43:07] It's like you don't realize it.
[00:43:09] Like, man, I should do that, you know?
[00:43:10] Kind of thing.
[00:43:11] Yeah, that's the trouble with learning.
[00:43:14] Like, let's just trouble with learning.
[00:43:16] It's hard to apply it yourself.
[00:43:18] Yeah.
[00:43:19] Once again, it's like you're jitsu.
[00:43:20] You can watch, I can show you how to do it.
[00:43:23] And then you can watch me do it.
[00:43:25] And then I can move your limbs around so that you do it.
[00:43:28] And then we do a drill where we drill the move 20 times.
[00:43:33] And then you get into a competition.
[00:43:35] And they move is there and you don't execute it.
[00:43:38] You don't execute it correctly because you haven't done it enough.
[00:43:40] Yeah.
[00:43:41] You have to do the move.
[00:43:44] Kind of do the move.
[00:43:45] You've got to do the move.
[00:43:46] Next one.
[00:43:50] So I'm watching Deadliest Catch, the fishing show.
[00:43:56] Wait, crab.
[00:43:57] Crab, crab.
[00:43:58] Crabbing show.
[00:43:59] Yeah.
[00:44:00] Alaskan, crab.
[00:44:01] Mm.
[00:44:02] Respect.
[00:44:03] So I'm watching Deadliest Catch.
[00:44:05] And a deckhand wasn't paying attention and let too many small crabs into the tank.
[00:44:14] This is big trouble for the captain.
[00:44:15] No, the kid admits his mistake and apologizes.
[00:44:18] Captain, you're fired.
[00:44:20] I've watched you screw up for years.
[00:44:23] What's the message here?
[00:44:24] Yeah.
[00:44:25] So it's the captain that fires.
[00:44:26] Yes.
[00:44:27] It sees the mistake and says the captain says you're fired.
[00:44:29] Okay, got you.
[00:44:30] Okay.
[00:44:31] Okay.
[00:44:32] So this is, this tells me a couple things.
[00:44:34] This tells me a few things.
[00:44:35] This tells me a lot of things.
[00:44:36] Right?
[00:44:37] First of all, the boss watched the deckhand screw up for years.
[00:44:43] My assumption is that he didn't say anything.
[00:44:47] He watched someone screw up for years.
[00:44:49] How is the deckhand going to improve if he doesn't get counseled on what his shortfalls
[00:44:54] are?
[00:44:55] Okay, so that could have happened.
[00:44:58] That's one assumption.
[00:44:59] Let's make the other assumption.
[00:45:01] The other assumption is that the captain did counsel the deckhand and watched him screw
[00:45:05] up for years and told him you better not do that.
[00:45:07] You better not do that.
[00:45:08] You better not do that.
[00:45:09] And he's now done it again.
[00:45:10] And guess what?
[00:45:11] He's getting fired.
[00:45:12] So that's understandable.
[00:45:18] So I think the question is implying kind of like, hey, hey boss, this was my fault.
[00:45:27] Shouldn't let that happen.
[00:45:28] And now the boss can say, oh, since you're taking ownership of that, that's no problem.
[00:45:33] We'll let it go.
[00:45:35] That doesn't happen.
[00:45:37] So if you have a concept in your brain that you think that when you take ownership
[00:45:42] from something that you're immune then from the punishment of the mistake you've made, that's
[00:45:47] not true.
[00:45:48] That's absolutely not true.
[00:45:50] Taking ownership of a mistake does not relieve you of responsibility of that mistake.
[00:45:59] In fact, the opposite of true, when you take ownership of a mistake, you're taking ownership
[00:46:03] of the mistake and you are raising your hand and saying, I own the mistake.
[00:46:08] And if there's punishment to be met and out, it needs to land on me.
[00:46:16] That's what ownership is.
[00:46:17] Ownership is not to get out of jail free card.
[00:46:21] You know what, it's my fault.
[00:46:22] You know, we joke about this.
[00:46:24] His my bust.
[00:46:25] Hey, my bust on that one.
[00:46:26] It won't happen again.
[00:46:28] So now everyone just ignores it?
[00:46:29] No.
[00:46:30] This is a serious violation.
[00:46:33] Having the wrong size crabs is kind of thing to get you rolled up by the fishing game
[00:46:37] department and all of a sudden you're getting shot down.
[00:46:40] It's a serious business.
[00:46:43] Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[00:46:45] If not more, or at stake here.
[00:46:47] And this kid isn't doing his job correctly.
[00:46:49] So either the boss, the captain, had mentored him and was fed up, which makes him a good
[00:46:56] boss.
[00:46:57] And this was his last warning and he failed his last warning.
[00:46:59] And there you go.
[00:47:00] Hey, I've been watching you screw up.
[00:47:02] I told you you screwed up.
[00:47:03] I've written you up about screwing up and I told you not to let this happen again.
[00:47:06] And you just let it happen again.
[00:47:07] You're fired.
[00:47:09] Or maybe the boss wasn't that square away.
[00:47:12] And he hadn't counted.
[00:47:13] He hadn't had the hard conversations early with him to square him away.
[00:47:16] And now the boss leaves something to be desired.
[00:47:20] Because he's just the first offense that he talks him about his hey, you're fired.
[00:47:26] When I took ownership of the blue on blue, in extreme ownership, first chapter, I could
[00:47:31] have been fired for that.
[00:47:34] I could have been fired.
[00:47:35] My boss could have said, yeah.
[00:47:36] Yeah, you're right.
[00:47:37] This is your fault.
[00:47:37] We can't have that happen out here.
[00:47:39] You're fired.
[00:47:40] And I said, Roger that.
[00:47:44] It's not hey, I own this.
[00:47:46] Please let me go.
[00:47:47] Yeah, I took this.
[00:47:49] Now here, I will say this though.
[00:47:53] So taking extreme ownership is not a get out of jail free card.
[00:47:58] But I will tell you this, if you make excuses, it is going to be worst in 99% of the
[00:48:04] situations.
[00:48:05] Well, you know the small crab snuck in when I wasn't looking, that's not my fault.
[00:48:11] Tactical crabs on the moon.
[00:48:14] Then you just look like an idiot.
[00:48:17] Right?
[00:48:19] So another thing that this brings up is this idea of preemptive ownership.
[00:48:24] And that is taking ownership of something.
[00:48:28] You don't want to take ownership after the fact.
[00:48:34] Using ownership, the idea of extreme ownership in its purest and most effective form
[00:48:39] is an hay, something went wrong.
[00:48:41] And I'm now taking ownership of the mistake.
[00:48:43] That's not the best extreme ownership scenario.
[00:48:47] The best extreme ownership scenario is when you take ownership prior to the mistake
[00:48:52] happening.
[00:48:53] And you realize that if there is going to be a mistake, you are going to own it.
[00:48:58] So what you're going to do is you're going to work hard to prevent that mistake from
[00:49:02] happening.
[00:49:03] That's preemptive ownership.
[00:49:05] You're taking ownership before the mistake happens.
[00:49:07] So this kid, this deck hand, could have put procedures in place to make sure no small
[00:49:13] crabs got in.
[00:49:14] It's sorted them out properly.
[00:49:17] But instead he thought, oh, you know what?
[00:49:18] It'd be no big deal.
[00:49:19] Just take ownership and then they'll say, it's okay.
[00:49:22] Or you know all the way and someone else or whatever has thinking it is.
[00:49:24] And he says, look, if I let small crabs in here, I am going to own it and I am going
[00:49:29] to get fired.
[00:49:31] Guess what?
[00:49:32] Perhaps he would have worked a little harder to prevent the small crabs from being
[00:49:36] where they weren't supposed to be.
[00:49:39] But see, when you have that out, when you think you can just blame someone else, that
[00:49:43] allows you to be slack.
[00:49:44] Yeah.
[00:49:45] When you think, well, this isn't really my response.
[00:49:48] But that's why when I work with companies, I don't have some thing that's going wrong.
[00:49:53] Some problem.
[00:49:54] Some procedure that's not working correctly.
[00:49:56] Some timeline that's not being met.
[00:49:59] And one of the first questions I ask it, normally like a huge step in the right direction
[00:50:03] to resolve the problem, is I go, okay, who's in charge of that process?
[00:50:09] And I'll bunch of people who we're looking around at each other and no one's raising their
[00:50:13] hand.
[00:50:14] And the minute I see that, I go, interesting.
[00:50:17] This is the answer to me.
[00:50:18] Now we know why the process is ineffective because no one has ownership of it.
[00:50:21] And if no one has ownership of it and the thing doesn't get done when it's supposed
[00:50:24] to get done, everyone just points at each other and says, yeah, well, the one that
[00:50:26] my fault is this fault is their fault.
[00:50:28] And then no one takes ownership of no one solves it.
[00:50:31] Whereas if you say, okay, echo you are in charge of this process.
[00:50:35] If it doesn't work, I'm coming after you.
[00:50:38] You know, now you can step up your game, preemptively, to prevent a mistake from occurring,
[00:50:45] prevent the little crabs from getting in the pot.
[00:50:49] So taking ownership isn't a good idea.
[00:50:51] Get out of jail, free card.
[00:50:54] If you have a subordinate, you are actually responsible for counseling them and coaching
[00:50:58] them and mentoring them and explaining to them what the standards are so that they can
[00:51:03] meet the standards explaining explicitly what the standards are so that they can meet those
[00:51:07] standards.
[00:51:09] And the optimal ownership takes place not only after, but more importantly, before something
[00:51:21] goes wrong.
[00:51:22] There you go.
[00:51:27] Not to mention, you got a take responsibility for solving the problem.
[00:51:30] Yes, you do.
[00:51:31] Apparently this decam guy, that's not the.
[00:51:34] He didn't take his ownership for the mistake.
[00:51:36] He didn't take ownership for solving the problem.
[00:51:38] He also didn't implement a solution to the problem.
[00:51:41] There's all kinds of problems.
[00:51:42] For years.
[00:51:43] By the way, yeah.
[00:51:44] So there you go.
[00:51:46] Next question.
[00:51:47] One mistakes did you make early, discussed in your live podcast that could have progressed
[00:51:51] to you further.
[00:51:52] Yeah, I think there's just some real big obvious ones.
[00:51:56] Wasted a bunch of time.
[00:51:59] You know, you wasted a bunch of time when you're young.
[00:52:02] You think you got forever and you waste time and whether it's doing stuff that's not
[00:52:07] productive, whether it's going out, get drunk.
[00:52:12] Whatever dumb things you waste time doing, whether it's just wasting time.
[00:52:17] And you know what?
[00:52:22] Look, I'm not saying don't have fun in your life because that's wrong answer to that's too
[00:52:24] extreme.
[00:52:25] What I am saying is I sometimes add a little too much fun.
[00:52:28] Sometimes I wasn't focused on the right thing.
[00:52:29] So wasted time is number one.
[00:52:31] Wasted money.
[00:52:32] Wasted a ton of money on dumb stuff.
[00:52:36] And I'd say that both of these are wasting time wasting money.
[00:52:40] Those are like the two biggest mistakes that I've made.
[00:52:44] But I would say the root of those mistakes is that I didn't do a good job of connecting
[00:52:51] the future to the present.
[00:52:54] You just don't, when you're young, I shouldn't say that.
[00:52:58] When I wish, I don't want to put a universal blanket of being dumb on everyone, even though
[00:53:03] you're not in your head pretty hard to leave over there.
[00:53:06] That's the thing.
[00:53:07] Yeah, we see a lot of people do this.
[00:53:10] Right.
[00:53:11] A lot of us, we waste our time, we waste our money and we don't connect what we're doing
[00:53:14] right now with what's going to happen in the future.
[00:53:17] And that is not a good policy to have.
[00:53:19] What we want to do and what I try and instill with kids, with my kids, with kids that I talk
[00:53:25] about on the podcast is I want to connect what decisions are being made right now with
[00:53:30] decisions that will, with the, with the end state that you end up with in your future.
[00:53:36] So if you take advantage of your time, you're going to be in a much better place.
[00:53:40] If you save your money, you're going to be in a much better place.
[00:53:42] If you invest your money properly, you're going to be in a much better place.
[00:53:45] If you train and you treat people, if you train hard, you're going to be in a much better
[00:53:48] place.
[00:53:49] If you treat people respectfully and you build relationships, you're going to be in a much better
[00:53:51] place.
[00:53:53] If you do the opposite of those things, you're going to be in a worse place.
[00:53:55] If you treat people like dirt, you're going to, they'll come back to bite you.
[00:53:59] If you waste your money, you won't have it.
[00:54:00] If you waste your time, you'll run out.
[00:54:03] So I think the biggest mistake really for me was that I failed to connect the present to
[00:54:11] the future.
[00:54:12] There are only ways that I succeeded in that early on, was through luck.
[00:54:18] Like I joined the Navy and I'm very lucky that I did because I was immediately building
[00:54:24] my future.
[00:54:25] Even though I had no, I wasn't my intent as immediately.
[00:54:28] I bought a house that was great.
[00:54:33] What did I buy it for?
[00:54:34] I wanted a place to live.
[00:54:36] What did I end up with?
[00:54:37] An incredible investment.
[00:54:39] Enough to buy another house.
[00:54:41] That one was a little bit more intentional.
[00:54:43] Wait a second.
[00:54:44] If I owned another house, and I was just talking about this with a friend of mine, it was
[00:54:50] explaining when he remembered when I got my second house.
[00:54:57] I was in my mind, Donald J. Trump, the real estate landlord, like master.
[00:55:05] Someone was going to be paying me rent.
[00:55:10] I had another house that I was going to live in.
[00:55:13] So that was what I started making this shift where I connected the present with the future.
[00:55:19] Yeah.
[00:55:20] So what you do today is directly correlated to where you'll end up in the future.
[00:55:25] That is in Ecos, favorite sort of thread of this entire podcast, is playing the long
[00:55:32] war.
[00:55:33] It took me too long to start fighting the long war.
[00:55:36] That's what I'll say.
[00:55:37] That was, say, the biggest mistakes from my early life.
[00:55:40] Yeah.
[00:55:41] And really, in a way, they could be viewed as not even really mistakes.
[00:55:47] I guess this is more of just sort of the way things happen.
[00:55:52] Because be most times we figure these things out later in life when the long game starts
[00:55:58] to materialize.
[00:55:59] Because when you're early in your career, the only short game is sort of there.
[00:56:03] And then in a way, actually no, at the end of the day, no.
[00:56:06] Because even as a little kid, you know the long game.
[00:56:08] You're familiar with it.
[00:56:09] A little bit.
[00:56:10] Because like, you ever had to save your money for something like an optimist price.
[00:56:15] Yeah.
[00:56:16] You know, something like that.
[00:56:17] And they said, you got to save your money for it.
[00:56:20] And, bro, you save your money.
[00:56:22] That's playing the long game.
[00:56:24] As a kid, you know, it's a kid version.
[00:56:26] So it's kind of the same thing.
[00:56:28] But maybe it's not as intuitive, you know, when you're little, when you're big, when you're
[00:56:31] grown.
[00:56:32] No, you're not saying to do it.
[00:56:34] It's the other thing is like, someone has to tell you.
[00:56:39] But like we just talked about, sometimes when people tell you you still just don't listen
[00:56:43] to them.
[00:56:44] Yeah.
[00:56:45] Yeah.
[00:56:46] You know, people say, hey, you should really do this.
[00:56:47] And you go, yeah, whatever.
[00:56:48] That's for you.
[00:56:49] Yeah.
[00:56:50] I'm gonna say that.
[00:56:51] Yeah.
[00:56:52] That's for you.
[00:56:53] One of my uncle's friends won the lottery.
[00:56:59] Years ago, like in the 70s.
[00:57:02] And he won one of those big lotteries, where he got money every year.
[00:57:08] You know, you could take the lump son or you could take the payments.
[00:57:11] The payments.
[00:57:12] He took the payments.
[00:57:13] Yeah.
[00:57:14] But one of the lottery.
[00:57:15] Right?
[00:57:16] Literally one of the lottery.
[00:57:17] Literally one of the lottery.
[00:57:18] And so the payments lasted 20 years.
[00:57:21] Well, when you're 22, that's forever.
[00:57:24] Yeah.
[00:57:25] Right?
[00:57:26] That's forever.
[00:57:27] Yeah.
[00:57:28] And so my dad was talking to him.
[00:57:31] Talking to his guy that won the lottery.
[00:57:32] And now he was at like the 19 year mark.
[00:57:35] Yeah.
[00:57:36] And guess what he had done with all this money?
[00:57:38] That's what he invested in real estate.
[00:57:40] Did he buy start companies?
[00:57:42] What do you think he did with this money?
[00:57:43] It's meant to.
[00:57:44] Yeah.
[00:57:45] He bought car and whatever.
[00:57:47] That 10, 10.
[00:57:48] And you know, like it's a dated girls and went to bars and went out for nice dinners.
[00:57:53] And did that for a long time.
[00:57:56] And so my dad says, hey, you know, they're talking about it.
[00:58:00] He says, well, you know, this is the last year that I'm getting my monthly payments for
[00:58:04] winning the lottery.
[00:58:06] My dad says, what are you going to do when the payments aren't coming anymore?
[00:58:13] And he says, I'm going to win again.
[00:58:15] So yeah, that's planning in a sense.
[00:58:22] Kind of.
[00:58:23] And no, it's not.
[00:58:25] Oh, this is, but man, that's one of the, but that tends to go like that for lottery winners.
[00:58:33] Yeah, apparently the lottery winning isn't a big, like happiness.
[00:58:37] No, it's bad.
[00:58:38] Yeah.
[00:58:39] It ends up being bad because life is a long, long game.
[00:58:43] No matter how you play it, the long game is the one that shakes out.
[00:58:47] You know, so if you're a player playing the short game, that's why you lose in life.
[00:58:51] If you play the short game all the time.
[00:58:53] Yes.
[00:58:54] And the people who play the long game made it all the time.
[00:58:55] I mean, it was playing it.
[00:58:56] You don't even have to dominate it.
[00:58:58] Although I'm not recommending not trying to dominate.
[00:59:01] I'm not saying trying to dominate.
[00:59:03] Yeah, you could come in shoot second to the last place.
[00:59:07] But if you're playing the game, you're going to be doing good.
[00:59:08] And along with you, when you come in second to last place in the long game, you still just
[00:59:13] beat every single other person that's playing the short game.
[00:59:17] Yep.
[00:59:18] You beat them all.
[00:59:19] Yeah.
[00:59:20] And it's not there.
[00:59:21] And they're over there looking around my gorgeous app.
[00:59:22] Yeah, how is who you're so square to it?
[00:59:24] Yeah, but it's not that complicated.
[00:59:27] You know, I mean, it's not easy.
[00:59:28] It's because it's not easy.
[00:59:29] You're wired to please.
[00:59:30] How do you go deep on this on that last warrior, kid podcast?
[00:59:33] Yeah.
[00:59:34] Oh, yeah.
[00:59:35] This, this, this, this, this short term.
[00:59:36] You need to get over the short term gratification.
[00:59:40] Yeah.
[00:59:41] And that is the one of the biggest lessons a kid can learn is that my actions today
[00:59:45] will affect my future.
[00:59:47] Yeah.
[00:59:48] And it's hard to convince some of that.
[00:59:51] It seems so distant.
[00:59:52] Yep.
[00:59:53] Like the future seems so distant when you're young.
[00:59:58] I always have another discussion with someone who would appear in it.
[01:00:02] And there was a level of frustration that, and it's the typical level of frustration from
[01:00:07] the parent, which was, you know, the kid has a lot of potential, but they're like,
[01:00:11] they're not training the way they should be and not working the way, you know, all that
[01:00:15] stuff.
[01:00:17] And what I tried to explain to the parent was that the potential that you're telling your
[01:00:24] kid that he has, they do not even comprehend what that means.
[01:00:30] It is not a, it is not a, it's not something that they can understand.
[01:00:35] It's completely intangible.
[01:00:37] Like even when you say, oh, if you keep practicing this, you could be the champion.
[01:00:42] Yeah.
[01:00:43] This means you might as well say, if you keep practicing this, he will be, you know,
[01:00:48] you're not able to do that.
[01:00:49] Yeah.
[01:00:50] It means nothing to them.
[01:00:51] Yeah.
[01:00:52] And so yes, you try to convince them.
[01:00:53] You try and explain it to them.
[01:00:55] But what I recommend is instead of trying to explain to them this massive concept of what
[01:01:01] their potential is, you try and give them some short term rewards that lead them in the
[01:01:07] right direction that are, are supportive of the long game, but they're easier mental connections
[01:01:13] for the kid.
[01:01:14] And this is the same thing applies to employees as well, right?
[01:01:18] You know, you get a young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young,
[01:01:20] employees as well, right?
[01:01:22] You know, you get a young, young employee that's, you know, they're not thinking they
[01:01:25] could be the regional manager, right?
[01:01:29] They're just thinking they're just happy to be here.
[01:01:31] But you're, you're looking at what I'm going to ask, you know, this is sharp kid.
[01:01:34] Could be could.
[01:01:35] So you might not say, look, one day you're going to be the regional manager in 22 years.
[01:01:40] Think about that.
[01:01:41] When you, you, somebody gets hired on as whatever.
[01:01:44] And you say, one day, you're, you could be the regional manager and you could make whatever.
[01:01:48] This big chunk of money.
[01:01:50] You're looking at you going, you're going to be here to, you know, I'm, I'm going to have
[01:01:53] this job for six months, whatever.
[01:01:54] Yeah.
[01:01:55] So what you want to do is just tie something a little bit closer to them to their reality.
[01:01:58] Yeah.
[01:01:59] Of, hey, here's where you could get a, here's where the bonus program works here.
[01:02:03] Have you seen this?
[01:02:04] You can make an extra, whatever.
[01:02:05] Yeah.
[01:02:06] And it's going to move them in the right direction, the long game, but they can comprehend
[01:02:10] it immediately.
[01:02:11] Yeah.
[01:02:12] That's my recommendation.
[01:02:13] Should even just compliments and encouragement are good, little micro rewards for those
[01:02:19] short term like, so I think you're my kids.
[01:02:21] Once again, we can't abuse them.
[01:02:23] Yeah.
[01:02:24] You have to abuse, you know, friendlyness with our children.
[01:02:26] We can't abuse, that means that's not the right way.
[01:02:30] Not the right way.
[01:02:31] We can't abuse cheerleading.
[01:02:33] Yeah.
[01:02:34] Right.
[01:02:35] We can abuse cheerleading with our kids and everything that they do is beautiful.
[01:02:37] Right.
[01:02:38] No, that's as beautiful.
[01:02:40] Yeah.
[01:02:41] A piece of art that you just created.
[01:02:43] What is it?
[01:02:44] Beautiful.
[01:02:45] Whatever it is.
[01:02:46] Yeah.
[01:02:47] No.
[01:02:48] That's not good.
[01:02:51] Yeah.
[01:02:52] That's not good.
[01:02:53] But you're just talking about abuse and the other thing is the other thing you have
[01:02:56] to be careful with is, you're telling your kid like, well, you're special.
[01:03:03] Or you're so perfect.
[01:03:05] Right.
[01:03:06] You know.
[01:03:07] And so you know.
[01:03:08] Yeah.
[01:03:09] So this can get better.
[01:03:10] Yeah.
[01:03:11] You're marginal.
[01:03:12] That's.
[01:03:13] No, that.
[01:03:14] No.
[01:03:15] Yeah. and what I mean encouragement and in compliments.
[01:03:19] It's like if they do something good, you compliment that good thing.
[01:03:22] That's essentially it.
[01:03:23] And yeah, like anything, you can throw out too many.
[01:03:27] And you can throw out too little really because the fulfillment or satisfaction of receiving
[01:03:31] that compliment isn't big enough for the work that they just did.
[01:03:33] Like man, I don't want to do those 100.
[01:03:36] I'm proud of my daughter to 90 burpees the other day.
[01:03:40] Why 90?
[01:03:41] Did you just want to withhold?
[01:03:42] No, I'm working on the century.
[01:03:43] I'm working on the four.
[01:03:44] I'm trying to get to 90 and say hey dad, you do whatever you want.
[01:03:49] I'm getting 10 more.
[01:03:50] Watch this.
[01:03:51] I'm getting to a hundough.
[01:03:52] Well, he was the thing.
[01:03:53] She's done that before, but not with 90.
[01:03:55] So I'm working her up.
[01:03:56] I started from like, I was like, hey, when she was real soon.
[01:03:58] One more time.
[01:03:59] I didn't time it.
[01:04:01] How are we going to recognize improvement?
[01:04:03] Because we're going to get to the number first.
[01:04:04] Then we go for a time.
[01:04:05] Got it.
[01:04:06] So I mean, that's the story.
[01:04:07] I mean, it's not like, you know, my life's mission.
[01:04:09] Of course.
[01:04:10] It's just a fun little thing that I do.
[01:04:12] But if.
[01:04:13] If sounds fun.
[01:04:15] Yeah, wonderful.
[01:04:15] Sure.
[01:04:17] But so if I'm like, hey, you're super strong.
[01:04:21] They like that or my kids like that when you call them strong.
[01:04:24] So every time they do something like exercise or something like that,
[01:04:28] they do a good workout or whatever.
[01:04:30] I'll say how strong they are or how strong they're looking or being or whatever.
[01:04:35] But if that feeling isn't enough to constitute that super hard,
[01:04:40] we're like if I over push them like I 90,
[01:04:42] given where we are with burpees with her.
[01:04:46] She's not raised.
[01:04:47] She wasn't ready for 90 at this time.
[01:04:50] So did you cry?
[01:04:51] No, she didn't cry.
[01:04:52] Thankfully.
[01:04:53] She'll cry.
[01:04:54] No shame.
[01:04:54] She'll cry.
[01:04:55] I went for a run with my youngest daughter.
[01:04:59] This is a while ago.
[01:05:00] I don't know how old she was at the time.
[01:05:02] But I was like, OK, we're going to start running.
[01:05:04] Because I want to improve for my all time at the school.
[01:05:08] I said, OK, you want to improve that my all time.
[01:05:10] I know how to do it.
[01:05:11] Here we go.
[01:05:14] So her mile time was weak.
[01:05:17] And I said, we can get it better.
[01:05:18] So the first run we went on, I'm not kidding.
[01:05:22] She, by the time we got one minute deep,
[01:05:27] she had tears welling up in her eyes.
[01:05:31] And I said, hey, just keep going.
[01:05:34] But the point of saying this is when I try
[01:05:41] to give children, especially my children or any children
[01:05:44] compliments, I try and compliment their hard work.
[01:05:48] As opposed to your strong or your smart, what I say is,
[01:05:52] you really worked hard for that and look at this great result.
[01:05:55] Because what it makes them realize is that great results
[01:05:58] come from hard work and guess what?
[01:06:00] That is the truth.
[01:06:01] Because we all know people that were incredibly smart,
[01:06:04] incredibly strong, incredibly talented,
[01:06:06] incredibly gifted, and they didn't do anything with any of those
[01:06:09] things.
[01:06:09] Because they didn't understand that they had to work hard.
[01:06:12] Even if you have all that skill, if you don't work hard,
[01:06:14] you're not going to get anywhere.
[01:06:15] Yeah, dang that's a good little.
[01:06:17] So lean towards complimenting the hard work.
[01:06:22] And that's what you really want to see.
[01:06:24] Let's face it.
[01:06:25] Let me ask you this.
[01:06:26] And this is a tough question.
[01:06:28] Would you rather have someone on your team
[01:06:32] that is extremely talented or extremely hard worker?
[01:06:36] Of course, it's easy.
[01:06:37] We all want to say, well, I take the talent
[01:06:39] because we can make the person work hard,
[01:06:40] but that's actually not true.
[01:06:42] That's the same thing.
[01:06:43] And the real talent, the best talent,
[01:06:46] really is you get someone that just knows how to grind
[01:06:49] and work hard.
[01:06:51] Like that's good.
[01:06:52] And that's going to be much more valuable
[01:06:54] than hey, this person's super smart
[01:06:57] or hey, this person's super strong.
[01:06:59] Occasionally, you get someone like GSP, George St. Pierre,
[01:07:04] who was way talented in multiple modalities
[01:07:11] and was a hard worker.
[01:07:13] You know what that person becomes?
[01:07:14] A world champion.
[01:07:15] Yeah.
[01:07:17] Sometimes you get a world champion
[01:07:18] that's just there because of hard work.
[01:07:20] Sometimes you get a world champion.
[01:07:21] That's just there because of talent.
[01:07:22] Occasionally, you get someone that's both
[01:07:24] and they're usually sort of a,
[01:07:26] just there more dominant, like a dominant.
[01:07:28] Yeah, that's true.
[01:07:30] And that's good.
[01:07:31] So I started to compliment the hard work.
[01:07:34] I personally like both, I like to,
[01:07:37] especially with my son like being strong and stuff,
[01:07:40] he really likes that.
[01:07:42] So he'll, it's to the point where if you help him do something,
[01:07:45] he'll get mad at you.
[01:07:46] You kind of get mad at you.
[01:07:47] Yeah, which I kind of like,
[01:07:48] I don't know where that's going to lead, you know,
[01:07:50] but I like that currently.
[01:07:52] So he has that sense of pride.
[01:07:55] We're being strong is a good,
[01:07:56] yeah, no, that's nothing wrong with that.
[01:07:58] So yeah, but man, if you add the hard work part of it,
[01:08:01] because being strong is essentially a result,
[01:08:03] you know, and he doesn't obviously is too.
[01:08:06] Yeah, it's really going to be easy connection
[01:08:08] if you'd make because it's, hey, you're strong
[01:08:10] and that's because you work hard.
[01:08:11] Yeah.
[01:08:12] Because many of you say you're strong
[01:08:13] because you got just changed.
[01:08:15] Cool.
[01:08:16] All those besit over here, be strong.
[01:08:17] You're strong.
[01:08:18] You're strong.
[01:08:19] That's true.
[01:08:20] What do you got?
[01:08:21] Yeah, it's true.
[01:08:22] And when you, especially if you don't recognize
[01:08:24] the hard work part of it, you know,
[01:08:26] and you just think you, as a kid,
[01:08:28] you're just rolling around strong.
[01:08:29] You're, you're basically you've reveled in the results
[01:08:32] for so long where it's now when it's hard work time.
[01:08:35] It's kind of like, wait, I'm not used to that part of this.
[01:08:36] So they say that can happen to,
[01:08:38] they call them gazelles in buds.
[01:08:42] These are people that like really fast good athletes.
[01:08:44] And, but they never lost before.
[01:08:46] Yeah.
[01:08:47] And if they start getting beat down,
[01:08:48] which you do get beat down,
[01:08:50] and they lose, they can't handle it mentally.
[01:08:52] Yeah.
[01:08:53] Oh yeah.
[01:08:53] So yes, sir, that is, that's real.
[01:08:57] Next question.
[01:08:58] Jocelyn, my wife told me that she sees,
[01:09:01] I am much more direct and less cordial than I used to be.
[01:09:05] I feel I've pushed too much into getting after it.
[01:09:08] And it makes those around me feel like I changed
[01:09:13] to someone else.
[01:09:15] Yeah, we have to be really careful, right?
[01:09:18] Because being more direct at less cordial
[01:09:23] is definitely not getting after it.
[01:09:25] In fact, it's the opposite.
[01:09:28] If you are getting after it in a correct manner,
[01:09:32] your wife should be completely stoked
[01:09:36] because you're gonna have more time for her
[01:09:38] because you're gonna be doing time management properly.
[01:09:41] You're gonna have,
[01:09:43] you're gonna be doing better at work,
[01:09:44] which means you're gonna be getting promoted
[01:09:46] or whatever, getting paid more or getting jobs
[01:09:49] to build your whatever something like that.
[01:09:51] You're gonna be healthier
[01:09:53] because you're working out,
[01:09:55] you're gonna be stronger because you're working out.
[01:09:56] You're gonna be more organized with things
[01:10:01] and you're gonna be more thoughtful about building.
[01:10:03] That's what it getting after.
[01:10:04] Like your relationship should be improving.
[01:10:06] Yes.
[01:10:08] And this is one of the echo Charles's favorite things
[01:10:13] to talk about.
[01:10:14] It's actually something that you've just brought up
[01:10:15] a bunch of times on the podcast,
[01:10:17] which is when someone says,
[01:10:19] no, that's just how I am.
[01:10:21] Like, you know what echo?
[01:10:22] I'm just gonna tell you the truth
[01:10:23] is that's just how I am.
[01:10:24] Just making an excuse for being a jerk
[01:10:26] coming out of the gate, which is not good.
[01:10:28] So if that's what you're doing with your wife,
[01:10:30] you know what?
[01:10:31] I'm just gonna get after it.
[01:10:32] Hey, this tune of casserole sucks.
[01:10:36] I'm just telling you what it is.
[01:10:38] That's how I roll.
[01:10:39] Like no, you're actually rolling in the wrong direction.
[01:10:43] When you're getting after it in a good way,
[01:10:45] your wife will be stoked.
[01:10:47] I was getting interviewed the other day.
[01:10:50] And I realized this.
[01:10:52] So I've written eight books.
[01:10:54] The eight one comes out in January of 2020.
[01:10:57] It's a lot of writing.
[01:11:00] I wrote 90% of the words in those books
[01:11:05] while my family was asleep.
[01:11:09] Then it made almost no impact on the family.
[01:11:14] I'm writing these books.
[01:11:17] Editing is a little bit different
[01:11:18] because there's a timeline on it.
[01:11:19] And I think sometimes my family would be a wake
[01:11:21] while I was editing and I had to get stuff turned back in.
[01:11:23] And it's a pain.
[01:11:25] But that's like a takes a week, right?
[01:11:27] But the other 90% of getting after it
[01:11:32] was done while my family is asleep.
[01:11:36] If you,
[01:11:37] concretarily, are getting after it
[01:11:39] at the expense of your family in friends,
[01:11:42] that's not, that's actually being selfish.
[01:11:47] So that's one part.
[01:11:48] Okay, so maybe you need to check yourself there
[01:11:50] and make sure that you're,
[01:11:51] got your priorities in order.
[01:11:54] There is a chance, however,
[01:11:57] that your friends don't like seeing you start to
[01:12:04] get some altitude, right?
[01:12:07] Start to be more successful,
[01:12:08] start to lead a better life.
[01:12:10] There's all kinds of groups of people
[01:12:12] that will just drag you back down.
[01:12:14] They don't want to see you in.
[01:12:16] That's sort of, I don't know,
[01:12:18] is that the fundamental kind of baseline
[01:12:20] human instinct I don't want to see you in.
[01:12:24] If there is an element of it to,
[01:12:26] to, I would not be surprised.
[01:12:29] Put it that way, but I don't know.
[01:12:30] There's at least a non-trivial part
[01:12:34] of the population that does not want to see you in.
[01:12:40] There's at least a percentage,
[01:12:42] whatever that percentage is,
[01:12:44] of the people that you know
[01:12:46] that does not want to see you in,
[01:12:48] they would rather see you fail.
[01:12:51] They would rather, and maybe fails not the word,
[01:12:53] but they would at least rather have you stay with them.
[01:12:56] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:57] That makes sense, really.
[01:12:59] So there's a chance that that's going on.
[01:13:01] Is there a chance that that's going on with your wife?
[01:13:05] Hopefully not, that's a slim chance,
[01:13:07] because if you think about it,
[01:13:08] your success, her success is predicated on your success.
[01:13:11] I mean, you are bound to each other,
[01:13:13] both each of your success is predicated
[01:13:16] on each other's success.
[01:13:18] So do I want my wife to be successful?
[01:13:21] Oh yeah, because that's my wife.
[01:13:25] And she's looking me going, yes, go be successful.
[01:13:27] The more successful I am, the more successful she is.
[01:13:31] So there's most likely your wife, in my opinion,
[01:13:36] would be supportive of your efforts,
[01:13:38] unless you're just to get out of control.
[01:13:41] There's a chance, I guess,
[01:13:42] that a wife could see someone change,
[01:13:47] and that's not the person that I married, right?
[01:13:50] But hold on, the person that you married was lazy.
[01:13:54] And I'm over here getting after it.
[01:13:56] The person that you married was making X amount of money,
[01:13:58] and I'm making a lot more than that.
[01:14:01] The person that you married was in a good physical shape.
[01:14:03] I'm in good physical shape.
[01:14:06] Most of the time, the wife would say,
[01:14:08] cool, yeah, I'm getting a better deal now.
[01:14:10] Occasionally, I think, you would get a spouse,
[01:14:13] I guess, could be the male or the female,
[01:14:15] could happen on either side.
[01:14:17] That goes, oh, you want to work hard,
[01:14:19] and I'm really not looking to do that.
[01:14:20] I was comfortable, right?
[01:14:21] I was comfortable, that's it.
[01:14:23] I'm comfortable.
[01:14:24] I don't want you getting all crazy.
[01:14:25] I'm over here being comfortable.
[01:14:27] So that could happen.
[01:14:29] I think that's unlikely.
[01:14:30] I think what's most likely is,
[01:14:32] you are focused on yourself a little bit too much.
[01:14:36] Check yourself for that.
[01:14:37] That should be the first person you look at.
[01:14:39] You.
[01:14:40] Yeah, that's true, huh?
[01:14:41] Because like, this is actually kind of common,
[01:14:43] where husband, wife, whichever the scenario is,
[01:14:47] where one, let's say, let's say two people,
[01:14:49] they get married, whatever,
[01:14:50] years down the road, one of the people in the couple,
[01:14:54] relationship improves himself a lot too.
[01:14:57] Loses a bunch of weight.
[01:14:58] They're literally by their own standard.
[01:15:01] They were not very attractive when they got married,
[01:15:04] but now this is 10 years later,
[01:15:05] whatever they become straight up attractive now.
[01:15:08] Making more money, more people want to hang out with them
[01:15:11] because they're nicer like all this stuff, straight up,
[01:15:14] across the board improvement,
[01:15:16] meanwhile the other person in the relationship didn't do that.
[01:15:19] Still married, still all good, no,
[01:15:22] infidel, nothing like that.
[01:15:23] Still married, but that person who didn't improve themselves
[01:15:26] will feel like they got phased out
[01:15:28] or kind of like the person might want to upgrade
[01:15:31] or something like that.
[01:15:32] So it's like, it's a positive they try and drag the person back down.
[01:15:35] Yeah, because you need to be back here,
[01:15:37] I need to be feel secure.
[01:15:38] Now I'm this husband and now my wife's
[01:15:40] I'm not used to a hot wife
[01:15:42] because when we got married, you weren't that hot.
[01:15:44] I loved you for you and all this stuff
[01:15:47] and what they say, whatever.
[01:15:49] And now you're a good person.
[01:15:51] I don't know.
[01:15:52] I don't know.
[01:15:53] I'm thinking of cliche movie thing.
[01:15:56] But anyway, the wife's all good looking now,
[01:15:59] people are like, people at the store,
[01:16:01] like, complimenting her and all this stuff.
[01:16:03] And the guys now used to it.
[01:16:04] And now in his mind, a little thing develops
[01:16:07] or it's like, oh, I'm not good enough now
[01:16:09] for this hot girl.
[01:16:11] And I'm going to buy her some cheetos.
[01:16:12] Yeah, bring her back down.
[01:16:14] So like at least have some manager boom
[01:16:17] out of control.
[01:16:18] Yeah.
[01:16:19] This person, that's not an uncommon thing.
[01:16:22] In that specific scenario, I guess that scenario
[01:16:24] is not very common though.
[01:16:26] It's not very common scenario.
[01:16:28] And then it would have to be doubly uncommon
[01:16:30] for someone to actually want to drag them back down.
[01:16:32] I have to throw it out there
[01:16:33] because it is a possibility.
[01:16:34] Yeah.
[01:16:34] But for this particular question, I don't think so.
[01:16:37] Only because this little indicator right here,
[01:16:39] my wife told me that she sees I am much more direct.
[01:16:44] And usually much more direct means insensitive
[01:16:47] in my experience.
[01:16:49] Why?
[01:16:49] It's don't do good.
[01:16:50] Generally speaking, within sensitivity.
[01:16:53] Less cordial.
[01:16:54] That's another one.
[01:16:55] In my opinion, in my experience, because I'm married.
[01:16:58] Yeah, that's cordial.
[01:16:59] You learn things.
[01:17:01] I'm going to give you an example.
[01:17:02] Something I learned about my wife.
[01:17:06] If my wife, if it isn't on the schedule,
[01:17:09] it's about enough to make my wife get mad.
[01:17:12] So in other words, if I said,
[01:17:15] hey, I'm going away for a month from now,
[01:17:20] I'm going away for six months on a work trip.
[01:17:24] I'll be back when I'm done with those six months.
[01:17:27] And when I'm gone, you're not going to be able to hear from me at all.
[01:17:29] She'd be like, okay, got it.
[01:17:32] When do you leave?
[01:17:33] And I'd say, well, I'm leaving whenever.
[01:17:35] September first.
[01:17:37] And she'd go, okay, she wouldn't be even remotely upset.
[01:17:42] She'd be good to go.
[01:17:44] If it was Friday night.
[01:17:47] And I came home and said, oh, I didn't tell you or Saturday night.
[01:17:53] I said, I didn't tell you, but I'm going over to Echos
[01:17:55] to watch the UFC.
[01:17:59] There's a decent chance that she's mad about that.
[01:18:03] Because she had in her mind that we were going to eat.
[01:18:05] Whatever, we were going out for dinner or whatever.
[01:18:08] But I didn't give the pre-plant situation.
[01:18:12] What if she didn't make a plan for that?
[01:18:14] It was just sort of maybe we could do that.
[01:18:16] But it's not on her.
[01:18:19] It's on me.
[01:18:20] It's on me for not informing her of what was going on.
[01:18:23] Because it doesn't really matter.
[01:18:24] All she knew is that I was coming home.
[01:18:27] And I was going to be around and that was what was happening.
[01:18:29] Yeah.
[01:18:30] Because if anything that is not playing, you know what's really funny?
[01:18:34] This is again with my wife.
[01:18:36] And this is where it became evident to me.
[01:18:38] Even if it's something that is positive for my wife,
[01:18:43] if I don't give her pre-planning cycle on what's going to happen.
[01:18:48] So in other words, if I was flying home and I'd been
[01:18:54] gone for a week and I got home and busted through the door
[01:18:58] and said, hey, I'm on a tail end of a 72 hour fast.
[01:19:02] I'm starving.
[01:19:03] I'm taking you out and I made reservations for this.
[01:19:05] Really nice dinner.
[01:19:06] I'm going to go get some, you know, $200 stake right now.
[01:19:11] There's a chance.
[01:19:14] But the percentage should be 100% she's stoked, right?
[01:19:20] That should be the percentage.
[01:19:22] However, with my wife, there's a 20 to 30% chance that she says,
[01:19:30] you know, I was going to take our daughter to the raffle.
[01:19:37] I don't know.
[01:19:38] Play bingo.
[01:19:39] And like that is enough.
[01:19:41] Yeah.
[01:19:42] And what I don't do is I say, oh, cool, you know what?
[01:19:44] We'll go tomorrow.
[01:19:45] What I don't do is try to impose it.
[01:19:48] So what you're saying is like lack of being cordial.
[01:19:52] What I'm saying is that it's not just like that's one example of me not being cordial.
[01:19:58] So I guess I guess to sum it up, my wife doesn't really like surprises.
[01:20:03] Yeah.
[01:20:04] She likes to have a plan.
[01:20:06] She likes to know what's happening and then she'll execute the plan.
[01:20:11] So that's what you got to be careful of.
[01:20:13] You would you got to be, well, not what you got to be careful of.
[01:20:15] That is one example of how these little things they don't make sense.
[01:20:20] It doesn't make sense that my wife wouldn't be super stoked to go out to an awesome
[01:20:24] stake house.
[01:20:25] That doesn't make sense to anyone.
[01:20:27] That's a superficial thing.
[01:20:28] And let me tell you something else that makes it a little bit tricky.
[01:20:35] Is I'm super insensitive to like changing plans.
[01:20:40] People change plans to me, I'm like, whatever.
[01:20:42] It's no, it's literally no factor.
[01:20:44] Like, oh, oh yeah, we've been planning to do this for six months.
[01:20:47] Someone's like, oh, I can't do it.
[01:20:48] I'm like, oh, okay, cool.
[01:20:49] You know what I mean?
[01:20:50] It means nothing to me.
[01:20:51] When things change, it means nothing.
[01:20:53] It has no impact on me.
[01:20:55] I have no emotional reaction to someone saying, hey, this, we can't do this now.
[01:21:01] I'm like, oh, okay, cool.
[01:21:02] I'm going to do something else.
[01:21:03] Yeah.
[01:21:04] So I'm at the other end of the spectrum, which means it took me a little while to figure
[01:21:09] out that, oh, this makes you mad.
[01:21:13] Yeah, got it.
[01:21:14] Yeah.
[01:21:15] And it's probably something like one level, like under the surface, too.
[01:21:20] It's not like, hey, I had this good, you know, the raffle was, was planning in my head.
[01:21:24] And that raffle's important.
[01:21:26] The raffle's not important.
[01:21:27] Neither is the dinner.
[01:21:28] It's like that part of it on that level is not important.
[01:21:32] It's one level deeper.
[01:21:33] It's the fact that I had to sit my head.
[01:21:35] You didn't tell me this other thing.
[01:21:37] And now like what I had in my head really means nothing.
[01:21:40] Yeah.
[01:21:41] So it's kind of that.
[01:21:42] Here's another funny thing about my wife.
[01:21:46] She's so into the planning thing that if I plan something, it has way more value to
[01:21:54] her.
[01:21:55] So in other words, if I say, hey, when I get back this Friday, I'm going to do a fast
[01:22:01] and I'm going to be super hungry.
[01:22:03] I'm going to make reservations for this Friday.
[01:22:06] And we can go out and get an awesome steak, Tom Hawke, rib eye.
[01:22:13] And like the fact that it was pre-planned, like I've done this before, where I've taken
[01:22:18] her and I've gotten reservations.
[01:22:21] And she'll be like, did you make reservations?
[01:22:24] And I'll say, yes, I'm like, yeah, I did.
[01:22:26] And I can see like a little smile.
[01:22:29] Like I care a little bit more that I made those reservations.
[01:22:32] That's what the spontaneity thing?
[01:22:35] No, no, no points for spontaneity.
[01:22:40] Zero.
[01:22:41] Zero points for spontaneity.
[01:22:42] Only points for pre-planned fires.
[01:22:45] You know what?
[01:22:46] Why?
[01:22:47] Because it's thoughtful.
[01:22:48] Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:49] Yes.
[01:22:50] Yes.
[01:22:51] Yeah, that's good.
[01:22:52] That's an interesting quality.
[01:22:54] And I guess my point in saying this, these things, is that everyone has these little
[01:23:02] personality traits.
[01:23:04] People you work with.
[01:23:06] People you're spouse, your children.
[01:23:08] They have these things.
[01:23:10] And if you figure out what those things are, you can actually utilize them to your advantage
[01:23:17] and you can bypass things that will be problematic.
[01:23:22] And something that you've said too is you say, oh, you do this stuff to me, meaning
[01:23:26] Jocco does, I do some like leadership trick to you.
[01:23:31] And you know that I'm doing it.
[01:23:33] But it's still like it works.
[01:23:36] And it still makes you feel the way that you know it's supposed to make you feel.
[01:23:39] That's my point.
[01:23:40] My wife will listen to this.
[01:23:43] And then I'll make reservations.
[01:23:45] And she'll still be here, even though that she knows that I'm doing it just because
[01:23:48] I know that it's going to be something that makes her happy.
[01:23:51] Yeah.
[01:23:52] So just because you reveal like, hey, I know this is what you're like or whether you
[01:23:56] reveal or not doesn't matter when someone has that characteristic, then you can utilize
[01:24:02] that characteristic.
[01:24:03] And I know that's not the best sounding word to talk about like manipulating my wife's
[01:24:09] emotions.
[01:24:11] But what I want to do is manipulate her emotions to make her feel happy about something
[01:24:16] the right way.
[01:24:17] Not necessarily a bad thing.
[01:24:18] Yeah.
[01:24:19] It's a good thing.
[01:24:20] So be cognizant when you're dealing with other human beings.
[01:24:26] Look for these things.
[01:24:28] You see these things if you take a step back.
[01:24:30] If you don't take a step back, you'll never see them.
[01:24:34] If you can't detach, when you tell your wife something and you see that it makes her
[01:24:39] mad, if you can't detach, if you're talking to an employee and you see that they're getting
[01:24:43] frustrated and you can't detach to try to figure out what that is, you're not going to
[01:24:46] make any real progress.
[01:24:48] Yeah.
[01:24:51] So to direct thing, we'd like to be, or when people are direct to us, it makes things easier
[01:25:00] for us, you know, but doesn't.
[01:25:02] It's way, way, way, who's the way we're talking to.
[01:25:04] Whoever people who are.
[01:25:05] Because here's the deal, man.
[01:25:09] The fact is a very, a very blunt force tool and not many people wield it well and not many
[01:25:20] people receive it well.
[01:25:22] Yeah.
[01:25:23] So if you're one of these people, is that your eye just looked to be direct.
[01:25:26] Right?
[01:25:27] That's not good.
[01:25:29] And very seldom, do you end up in situations where you can just be direct with people?
[01:25:35] You have to have real, strong, built relationships with people where you can just be that
[01:25:43] blunt and direct with them.
[01:25:46] Now there are methodologies where you can be direct without being direct.
[01:25:51] You know, you can say things that are, hey, this is what we need to get done right now.
[01:25:54] You can take an edge off of it.
[01:25:57] You can, and the way you usually do that is by taking your ownership of what it is you're
[01:26:00] trying to make happen.
[01:26:01] So what I don't say is like echo, you need to get this thing edited tonight.
[01:26:05] Yeah.
[01:26:06] Right.
[01:26:07] I don't do that.
[01:26:08] I might say, hey, is there any chance we could get this thing edited tonight?
[01:26:12] Because if we don't, we're going to have a gap in releases which by the way we haven't
[01:26:18] had.
[01:26:19] And that's kind of a thing.
[01:26:21] Yeah.
[01:26:22] You see, even you just kind of know that it's a thing.
[01:26:25] It is, isn't it?
[01:26:26] Right?
[01:26:27] And all of a sudden, you want to edit that thing.
[01:26:29] Not because I told you do, but because you want to keep the gap from opening up.
[01:26:33] Sure.
[01:26:34] So I was, I was directly telling you, but I was indirect.
[01:26:38] Yeah.
[01:26:39] So there's ways to do it.
[01:26:40] But you got to be careful with direct.
[01:26:44] Direct.
[01:26:45] It takes a long time to to hone the scalpel of direct to where it just gets where you
[01:26:52] want to cut and it doesn't leave any collateral damage.
[01:26:56] Not many people would have good at it.
[01:26:58] Every few people are good at it.
[01:27:00] Yeah.
[01:27:01] That's hard.
[01:27:03] Next question.
[01:27:05] Jockel.
[01:27:06] And you know that makes people mad.
[01:27:10] What?
[01:27:11] When you say, listen, you can't just be, you can't just throw to people.
[01:27:14] People want to say, like, there's the book.
[01:27:17] There's a book called Radical Frankness or something like that.
[01:27:24] It's not the name of the book, but it's something like that.
[01:27:26] It's like, hey, we just going to tell the total radical transparency or something like that.
[01:27:31] And it's like, we're just going to tell the truth all the time.
[01:27:34] And we can get there, but man, it is work.
[01:27:39] And it's not even work that has to be that necessarily is the best use of work.
[01:27:51] So yeah, I just know, I just know, I hear people all the time.
[01:27:54] Well, you know, and people, that's what people want me to say.
[01:27:56] I'm going to work with a company that like, you know, what we really need help, what's
[01:27:59] we just need to really learn to be direct with each other.
[01:28:01] Yeah.
[01:28:02] And what they really should be saying is what we need to do is we need to learn to communicate
[01:28:07] with each other, be open about what issues we have, how to solve those problems, and be
[01:28:14] more tactful in our discussions so that people are receptive.
[01:28:18] Yeah.
[01:28:19] Because think about what I just said, if it's not just about me being direct, the more
[01:28:26] important, the only way that I can be direct is if I have set you up in such a way that
[01:28:35] you or I've built you in such a way that you're receptive to my directness.
[01:28:41] Because me being direct without you being receptive, it doesn't work.
[01:28:46] And so often that's what I see.
[01:28:48] I see, hey, I'm direct, but you're not receptive.
[01:28:53] It's, it's game over.
[01:28:55] So even if I'm direct, I'm only 50% of the solution because you have to be receptive.
[01:29:01] What's easier when I, when I go indirect, I become 90% of the solution because I'm going
[01:29:08] to get it into your brain without resistance.
[01:29:11] So I, it's an easier, it's easier upfront as me.
[01:29:14] I'll just be direct.
[01:29:16] That's easy upfront because I just say echo, you're going to get this stuff edited.
[01:29:21] Now, that's direct.
[01:29:22] One of the chances of you being receptive to that, 50%?
[01:29:27] You know, whereas if I, well, let me rephrase that.
[01:29:31] In order for this to be effective, you have to be receptive to it.
[01:29:35] So I only have 50% of the solution.
[01:29:38] You have the other 50%.
[01:29:40] Whereas if I say, like I said before, you know, hey, echo, is there any chance we could get
[01:29:45] this done tonight because here's what's at stake and I go indirect and I make that idea.
[01:29:49] I make your answer, you're going to give me the answer.
[01:29:52] I want, I know it can be edited tonight, right?
[01:29:56] I know that.
[01:29:57] It makes it.
[01:29:59] And so I'm going to, you're actually going to tell me, I'm putting it into, I'm giving
[01:30:05] you to all you have to do is just tell me.
[01:30:07] And now I'm the one that's receptive.
[01:30:08] Yes, we can.
[01:30:09] Oh, that's great.
[01:30:11] That's great.
[01:30:12] I'm glad.
[01:30:16] So that's something very important to talk about.
[01:30:18] If you want to talk about learning to be direct to with each other, what you really have
[01:30:22] to learn is how to be receptive to directness.
[01:30:25] That's the, that's the long pole in the tent.
[01:30:29] That's what organizations are missing out on.
[01:30:31] Being direct as easy.
[01:30:34] Being direct as the easiest thing in the world.
[01:30:37] You've tell people what you think.
[01:30:39] That's easy.
[01:30:41] What's hard is setting the other person up, developing a relationship so that they're receptive
[01:30:45] to what you're saying.
[01:30:46] Be careful.
[01:30:48] You just play football back in the day.
[01:30:51] And this new quarterback came in.
[01:30:54] What's weird is I forget his name.
[01:30:56] I'm just drawing a blank right now.
[01:30:58] But new young guy tall, any of it gun.
[01:31:01] If you're quarterback and you have a gun, that's impressive.
[01:31:04] Yeah, for sure.
[01:31:05] Means you throw far and fast.
[01:31:07] Here's the thing, though.
[01:31:10] Especially when you're new and you have a gun, you're going to show that gun.
[01:31:14] You're going to be like, when you're playing, when you're warming up before practices and
[01:31:17] stuff like that, you're throwing it hard.
[01:31:19] So this guy was throwing it hard at me.
[01:31:21] I was a receiver.
[01:31:23] It was just standing.
[01:31:24] We were just standing there.
[01:31:25] I wasn't running around.
[01:31:26] So he's throwing it and it's hurting my hand.
[01:31:29] To the point where I couldn't catch some of them because they were coming just too fast.
[01:31:33] For that distance, whatever.
[01:31:35] And, sure, I was impressed with this guy's gun.
[01:31:39] But when we run routes and stuff, he'd still kind of do that.
[01:31:43] I guess maybe to impress the coaches.
[01:31:45] He's a young guy, whatever.
[01:31:48] Here's the thing people would miss his balls.
[01:31:50] They wouldn't catch him because they're coming too hard.
[01:31:52] They're hurting your hands.
[01:31:54] Messing you up.
[01:31:55] So it makes it really hard.
[01:31:57] I get it.
[01:31:58] It's great practice for the receivers.
[01:31:59] Totally is.
[01:32:00] But as far as to effectively land a pass, you know, to complete a pass.
[01:32:05] Right.
[01:32:06] To the work like this.
[01:32:07] And we had this other quarter-long echo.
[01:32:08] Let me just stop you because you may have just made the best analogies that ever made
[01:32:13] on this podcast.
[01:32:14] That is it.
[01:32:15] Cool.
[01:32:16] If you can throw that thing direct, but if you're throwing it too hard and the person's
[01:32:20] not ready to receive it, not even to mention that you might not be ready to read
[01:32:24] you might be looking in the other direction.
[01:32:25] That they'll hit you in the back of the head.
[01:32:27] What good is that direct comment?
[01:32:29] It's zero good.
[01:32:30] It's not good.
[01:32:32] Hurting your hands.
[01:32:33] When you try it, it receives it.
[01:32:34] It hurts you.
[01:32:35] And you don't want to hear anymore.
[01:32:36] You want it anymore to be thrown at you.
[01:32:38] Nope.
[01:32:39] Okay.
[01:32:40] Proceed.
[01:32:41] There's other quarterback who came in from Stanford, but your hard work is paying off.
[01:32:45] That's it.
[01:32:46] Thanks.
[01:32:47] I knew it would.
[01:32:49] So, is that the quarterback came in?
[01:32:50] That quarterback make it anywhere.
[01:32:52] Did he make it?
[01:32:53] He did not make it to the NFL.
[01:32:55] So, it's like quarterback came in.
[01:32:56] His name is Tim Kerry.
[01:32:57] He came from Stanford.
[01:32:59] And he came in.
[01:33:00] He was the opposite.
[01:33:01] Actually not the opposite.
[01:33:02] Because he had a guy.
[01:33:03] He could throw far enough.
[01:33:04] But the way he threw it was like, it was like the perfect pass.
[01:33:09] And every distance had a different velocity on it.
[01:33:11] It was like that kind where the next, if it would modulate it, it was so well.
[01:33:18] He modulated so well where it was.
[01:33:19] Where it was.
[01:33:20] For those chances.
[01:33:21] Correctness.
[01:33:22] Oh, yeah.
[01:33:23] Everything.
[01:33:24] And for them to get better, he would have to physically walk it and put it in your hand.
[01:33:28] It was like that.
[01:33:29] Good.
[01:33:30] When it come, you know.
[01:33:32] And when you have them side by side, oh man.
[01:33:35] I want that direct guy.
[01:33:37] Want a finesse guy.
[01:33:39] No.
[01:33:40] But he did have the capability.
[01:33:41] He did have the capability.
[01:33:42] Did he get to the NFL?
[01:33:43] I, maybe.
[01:33:45] I forget.
[01:33:46] He left Stanford to come to your college.
[01:33:48] Oh, I forget why.
[01:33:49] But I think it was a whole thing.
[01:33:52] There was a few Stanford guys that came.
[01:33:54] Yeah.
[01:33:55] That's interesting.
[01:33:56] A few guys from Stanford that came to your school.
[01:33:59] They didn't.
[01:34:00] Yeah.
[01:34:01] It was doing it.
[01:34:02] I want to say when we changed coaching staffs.
[01:34:04] Oh, they might have been some scouts connections.
[01:34:07] Maybe like some relationships that were already there.
[01:34:09] Even some of the coaches I think came from that area.
[01:34:12] I don't know.
[01:34:13] I forget that was a long time ago.
[01:34:14] But nonetheless, yeah.
[01:34:16] That's what it shook out.
[01:34:18] Check out.
[01:34:19] So there you go.
[01:34:21] Jocco.
[01:34:22] 13 year street cop here.
[01:34:26] My old man died when I was 10.
[01:34:27] It cut deep and I grew up with no one.
[01:34:30] Having two boys on my own now and loving to get after it on the street.
[01:34:34] I worry about the risk.
[01:34:37] How do I balance being the spear with ensuring I stay around for that?
[01:34:45] So first of all, we have to recognize that there's no way that you can ensure that you
[01:34:50] stay around.
[01:34:53] And in fact, one day you will not be around.
[01:34:55] One day none of us will be around.
[01:34:57] That's the fact.
[01:34:59] And that actually doesn't matter what your job is.
[01:35:04] And there's all kinds of things.
[01:35:06] Regardless of your job, whether you have a car accident, whether you have a heart attack,
[01:35:09] whether you have cancer or a plane crash or a random violence or some random accident,
[01:35:14] there's all different kind of ways to die.
[01:35:16] Now, you are correct that the death rate of cops is higher.
[01:35:23] It's higher than a normal civilian.
[01:35:26] But what, like, loggers, construction workers, they all have higher rates of death than a cop,
[01:35:33] roofers, roofers.
[01:35:38] If you're a roofer, you have a higher rate of death than a cop.
[01:35:41] Any drivers, anyone that drives for a living, whether they're a trucker or whether they're
[01:35:46] literally a traveling salesman, they have a higher rate of death than being police.
[01:35:54] So no matter what you do, there's a chance that you could die.
[01:36:00] And I'll tell you what, I think about this sometime in the reverse of what scares you about
[01:36:06] what your kids do.
[01:36:07] If your kids are engaging in activity that could be dangerous, whether it's parachuting,
[01:36:12] whether it's rock climbing, whatever.
[01:36:14] Like there's things that your kids could do that they could die.
[01:36:19] What you could do is not allow them to do it, wrap them in bubble, bubble wrap and not
[01:36:26] allow them to go anywhere.
[01:36:28] And guess what, even if you do that, there's still a chance.
[01:36:32] And you've taken away their growth.
[01:36:36] So you can look at it in the reverse as well, that there's some things that you're not
[01:36:41] going to be able to control.
[01:36:44] And no matter what, you're a kid, you could say, I don't want my kid to join the military
[01:36:48] and so they go to college and what happens in college.
[01:36:51] They get hit by a job driver.
[01:36:53] They, like there's enough bad things that can happen in either one of those situations.
[01:36:58] And same thing with you and your job.
[01:37:00] You could go get a job doing something, unless you get a job that's just straight up,
[01:37:05] in an administrative situation with no, with very limited commute and very limited driving,
[01:37:13] then that might increase your chance a little bit.
[01:37:16] But then you know, then are you doing something that you actually like to do?
[01:37:22] So there's your dilemma.
[01:37:24] So what do you do in a situation like this?
[01:37:26] What you do is you train and you prepare and you vigilant and you take care of your
[01:37:31] sons.
[01:37:32] Obviously, and you explain your job to them and you explain to them why you train hard
[01:37:37] and explain to them, why you're willing to make a sacrifice to keep others safe, including
[01:37:45] them.
[01:37:46] You work every day to keep them safe as well.
[01:37:50] And if you explain that to your sons, they will grow up with an understanding of service
[01:38:01] and discipline and duty and courage and honor.
[01:38:09] And by the way, if something did happen to you, the model that you set for them would have
[01:38:20] massive impact would have massive impact on them and how they would live their lives.
[01:38:29] And I believe it would be actually a positive impact.
[01:38:32] Sure, would they miss you absolutely?
[01:38:35] Sure, would they wish more than anything that you could be back?
[01:38:38] Yes, but would they recognize that their dad made this sacrifice?
[01:38:43] Yes, they would.
[01:38:45] Would they live to honor that sacrifice?
[01:38:47] Yes, they would.
[01:38:49] So that's one thing you can do if you want to keep that profession.
[01:38:58] Now if that, if you can't get around that, if that doesn't make sense, which it's understandable,
[01:39:03] if you look at me and say, hey, doggle, I get it.
[01:39:05] I want my kids to be raised with honor, but I'd want to be there, and that's more important
[01:39:09] to me.
[01:39:10] And if that's where you end up, then what you have to do is plot out what another job, what
[01:39:17] another career is going to be.
[01:39:19] And like I said, then you have to make it doing something that legitimately gets you into
[01:39:25] a better survival rate, which by the way, outlaws just about every outdoor job you could
[01:39:34] have.
[01:39:35] If you work in construction, nope, that's not it.
[01:39:40] Working as the lecturers, nope, that's not it.
[01:39:41] Working as alignment, nope, that's not it.
[01:39:44] All those jobs, all those outdoor jobs go look at this statistics, go Google, death rates
[01:39:50] in jobs.
[01:39:51] And there's all kinds of fishermen.
[01:39:53] No, forget about it.
[01:39:56] There's so many jobs that have a high death rate where accidents happen.
[01:40:00] So what you're talking about going into the life you're going into would be going into
[01:40:05] would be an administrative job of some kind.
[01:40:10] And if you think you can do that, and you think that'll be, give you the satisfaction that
[01:40:14] you want, then it's a possibility.
[01:40:17] Think about it.
[01:40:18] But if you look at it and you think you know what, that's not for me.
[01:40:23] Then, train hard to prepare, build a great relationship with your sons.
[01:40:28] They vigilant, don't get complacent ever.
[01:40:33] And be aggressive.
[01:40:34] But have to throw that one in there because in my opinion, when an individual gets scared
[01:40:46] or gets hesitant or gets overprotective of themselves, I believe they're in more danger,
[01:40:51] not less danger in more danger.
[01:40:53] So if you think that having kids, having your sons is making you less aggressive and more
[01:41:01] scared, I think you're at higher risk.
[01:41:07] So if you're going to do the job, you do the job.
[01:41:10] You get aggressive when you do the job.
[01:41:13] And if you can't, then you might want to look and see if there's other alternatives that
[01:41:20] are out there.
[01:41:21] And I would say, is this how often, like your street copy, you've been there for 13 years,
[01:41:27] is there another department you could go to?
[01:41:29] Is there some other way to serve and stay connected?
[01:41:33] Use your experience in another way.
[01:41:37] Maybe one area that has a little less probability of getting killed.
[01:41:44] Again, you got to look if that's something you really want to do.
[01:41:47] So ultimately, and I tell this to people, a lot is there's only one person that can make
[01:41:52] this decision, and it's not me.
[01:41:54] The only person that can make this decision is you.
[01:41:56] So think through it, be thoughtful.
[01:41:58] You can even talk about it with your boys, depending on how old they are.
[01:42:04] But you can talk about it with them, explain to them.
[01:42:08] And you know, see what they say?
[01:42:12] So obviously, there's one way that conversation go, hey, would you guys be sit?
[01:42:18] Would you guys want me to die?
[01:42:19] Right?
[01:42:20] Of course.
[01:42:21] What are they going to say?
[01:42:22] Oh my gosh, quit that job immediately.
[01:42:23] We don't want you to do that.
[01:42:26] So you're going to have to think about what the ages of your kids are.
[01:42:30] But you're going to have to think through that one whether or how you address it with them.
[01:42:33] But certainly, I always look at it that there's risk at everything you do.
[01:42:41] The money will take risk doing something that you love doing, and that you know is helping
[01:42:45] other people.
[01:42:46] And you know a setting a good example for your boys.
[01:42:50] And if that doesn't make sense, cool, find a different job.
[01:42:56] Next question.
[01:42:58] I was young by living in a foster home and was sexually assaulted by my foster father,
[01:43:03] and sometimes other people over a course of a couple of years.
[01:43:07] I was eventually adopted.
[01:43:08] And what had happened to me was never discussed and I never got out for it.
[01:43:12] I was afraid of everything.
[01:43:13] And eventually, I played sports and ice-cream, felt less afraid.
[01:43:17] Went into the army and felt completely unaffraid of anything.
[01:43:20] When I got out, I got on to a long-term relationship.
[01:43:24] I told my then girlfriend, what had happened to me?
[01:43:27] She was the first person I ever told about this.
[01:43:29] She convinced me to reach out to my foster parents.
[01:43:31] And I did.
[01:43:32] And it was a total disaster.
[01:43:34] They kept my room where all this bad stuff had happened exactly the same as it was 20 years prior
[01:43:41] when these horrors had occurred.
[01:43:44] I had my moment to confront this monster that had done this to me.
[01:43:49] And I failed.
[01:43:50] I used a word that he always said to me, which was, I used a word that he always said
[01:43:55] to me when he was assaulting me.
[01:43:57] He just said, sometimes people change.
[01:44:01] All of a sudden, I was a weak young boy again.
[01:44:05] And I couldn't fight back.
[01:44:06] I left the house and had serious self-doubt.
[01:44:09] Eventually I became a cop.
[01:44:11] And then a detective in a faced all types of bad people from junkies to murders.
[01:44:17] I even get full confessions out of child rapists.
[01:44:20] I'm sick of my stomach afterwards.
[01:44:23] It's terrible to hear what these animals do.
[01:44:27] My question is this.
[01:44:28] Recently the past has come back with a vengeance.
[01:44:31] I can't get through a short time, maybe an hour or two without thinking about the past
[01:44:35] and my failure.
[01:44:37] The only time I have peace is when I absolutely destroyed myself working out.
[01:44:42] I consider it punishing myself and feel better when I do it.
[01:44:45] How can I stop this or at least manage it better?
[01:44:52] So this is, I mean, obviously horrible situation and horrible that you had to live through
[01:45:02] this and that any kid or any one, any human would have to go through this, as far as
[01:45:11] how you can manage this better.
[01:45:14] I'm going to go a little bit here.
[01:45:18] So one of the blocks of training that we go through in a seal platoon is called close
[01:45:27] quarters combat.
[01:45:29] And this is the training you're in a thing called the kill house.
[01:45:33] It's ballistic walls.
[01:45:34] There's targets in there.
[01:45:36] You're moving around dynamically.
[01:45:37] You're shooting live fire ammunition.
[01:45:39] There's people.
[01:45:41] Six inches away from you.
[01:45:42] You're taking really close shots.
[01:45:45] There's a lot of pressure in there.
[01:45:48] There's a lot of details, a lot of standard operating procedures and safety procedures that
[01:45:52] you have to follow.
[01:45:53] There's a lot of process.
[01:45:54] It's like, do you need to go left or right?
[01:45:57] Is that a good guy or a bad guy?
[01:45:58] Because you have to identify the targets.
[01:46:00] Should you move or should you stay?
[01:46:03] How do you communicate that you need to move?
[01:46:05] Should you shoot or should you not shoot at a target?
[01:46:08] And so there's all these things going on when you enter a room.
[01:46:12] All these things that you have to go through.
[01:46:16] All these steps that you have to take, all these procedures that you have to follow.
[01:46:20] All these decisions that you have to make.
[01:46:21] And it all happens in a split second.
[01:46:24] And so in a kill house, the training cadre is actually above you.
[01:46:32] It's not a normal house.
[01:46:34] The rooms have what we call catwalks above them.
[01:46:37] So the cadre can be up above you in the catwalks and they're walking around and
[01:46:42] they're watching you very closely.
[01:46:44] It's like watching a football game on TV.
[01:46:47] You're seeing it from the perfect view above the person.
[01:46:50] And they're in the room with you, but they're not in your way at all because they're
[01:46:53] up on the catwalk.
[01:46:55] So what happens is when a room entry happens, there's a lot of, you catch a lot of critique
[01:47:02] from the people in the catwalk.
[01:47:06] And they'll say, you could, you could have done this or you could have done that or you
[01:47:11] could have moved left or you should have pushed forward.
[01:47:13] There's, you know, you, it would be better if you'd done this other thing.
[01:47:16] So there's all these different things.
[01:47:18] And when my cadre was running it, you know, that's what we do.
[01:47:21] That's what happened to me when I was cadre.
[01:47:23] That's what I would do.
[01:47:24] That's what everyone does.
[01:47:27] And at some point, I kind of realized that all that stuff is good.
[01:47:31] And I get it.
[01:47:32] Like you've got to get people to run the procedures correctly.
[01:47:35] But in a certain point, what I would tell, like after a guy was kind of beat down,
[01:47:42] like you just couldn't get something right or you would, you know, punch people,
[01:47:45] jump on him about a decision that he made or a movement that he made or whatever.
[01:47:51] And I'm not talking about safety things.
[01:47:53] Because the safety thing is different.
[01:47:54] I'm talking about a tactical decision.
[01:47:56] And when you walk into a room, there's a bunch of tactical decisions you can make.
[01:47:59] And if there's, 10, if there's five different decisions that you could make when you walk into
[01:48:04] a room, there's something that there's, you know, there's one way of doing it that would
[01:48:09] be like really clean, one would be a little bit less.
[01:48:12] One might be just as clean as the first one, but it's a different attitude.
[01:48:15] There's just all these different decisions that you could make.
[01:48:20] You know, it's like just a multitude of ways that you could react.
[01:48:26] Because that's what this question is.
[01:48:27] How you reacted in this situation.
[01:48:30] And eventually, as I would see this with an individual, I would eventually, I, what
[01:48:37] I would tell guys is, listen, you did what you did.
[01:48:47] You did what you did.
[01:48:49] That's what you did.
[01:48:51] That's the decision that you made at the time.
[01:48:54] And you know what?
[01:48:56] There's different ways you could have done it.
[01:48:57] You don't like the way you did it.
[01:48:58] I don't like the way you did it.
[01:49:01] Someone, one of the other cadre members doesn't like the way you did it.
[01:49:04] It doesn't, what I'm saying, it doesn't really matter.
[01:49:06] First of all, you can't take it back.
[01:49:08] You can't go back and undo it.
[01:49:11] And by the way, you don't get to rehearse these things to a point where you get to do this
[01:49:15] perfectly.
[01:49:16] Because you won't be able to do that.
[01:49:18] If you rehearsed a move in a room that you had seen before and you rehearsed it 10 times,
[01:49:23] that's not, that's a totally different game.
[01:49:25] Right?
[01:49:26] If I already know what the room consists of, and I'm going to rehearse and choreograph
[01:49:30] the entire movement, that's a different game.
[01:49:32] That's not decision making.
[01:49:33] That's just, that's just rope memorization.
[01:49:35] We're not talking about that.
[01:49:37] We're talking about how did you react and what you did is what you did and you did it
[01:49:42] for a reason.
[01:49:43] What you saw in front of you, you made this decision for a reason.
[01:49:48] Maybe you saw a threat when there wasn't one there or you lost situational awareness
[01:49:53] or you rushed, you went too fast, you tried to rush and all those things can kind of
[01:49:58] trip you up.
[01:50:00] But that's what you did and you did what you did and you can't take it back.
[01:50:03] Instead of everyone sitting there saying you should have done this and you should have done
[01:50:06] that, let's do this.
[01:50:10] Let's see what we can learn from it.
[01:50:13] Let's see why you did what you did.
[01:50:17] Let's see why you made that decision.
[01:50:20] Because once we know why you did something, now we have something that we can work with,
[01:50:26] we have something that we can improve upon.
[01:50:33] That is what I think you need to do in this situation.
[01:50:39] And really when anyone makes a mistake or has a reaction that they don't like, you can't
[01:50:45] worry, you can't continue to worry about something that is already transpired, what you
[01:50:49] have to do is you have to look at and say what can I learn from it?
[01:50:55] What can I take from this and how can I take this mistake and make me better?
[01:51:03] So you could look at this.
[01:51:04] Why did you do that?
[01:51:07] Maybe you did it because you didn't want to open up these old wounds.
[01:51:11] Maybe you did it because you would have confronting this individual would have caused
[01:51:16] more drama and that drama, you at that moment, you assessed and said, you know what?
[01:51:21] This drama isn't worth it.
[01:51:24] Maybe you protected yourself from more drama and that was your instinct.
[01:51:30] Maybe if you were to start confronting this guy and go and crazy, who knows what could
[01:51:34] happen and maybe it could have taken a turn for us?
[01:51:37] We don't know what the outcome was.
[01:51:39] We know that you weren't happy with your decision, understandable, but we don't even know
[01:51:43] what the other decisions were to lead to.
[01:51:45] So you're actually getting bogged down and distraught about something that you don't even
[01:51:50] know if it was a good decision or a bad decision.
[01:51:52] It feels like it was a bad decision, but you don't know what the outcome is of the other
[01:51:55] decisions even were.
[01:51:59] So you can't change the outcome of what happened in the past.
[01:52:03] You can't do it.
[01:52:07] But what you can do is you can grow from it.
[01:52:09] That's what you can do.
[01:52:12] You can learn from it.
[01:52:13] You can actually take that scenario and you can mentally replay it in your head and you can
[01:52:19] figure out if possibly their would have been or could have been a better outcome.
[01:52:25] Or maybe that that outcome that you had wasn't that bad.
[01:52:29] Maybe it leads somewhere else.
[01:52:30] We don't know yet.
[01:52:34] But that's where you are at right now.
[01:52:39] You can't change the outcome of something that has occurred in the past.
[01:52:46] Now I'm going to throw a little dichotomy at you right now.
[01:52:50] And I'm going to say something that's a little bit might be a little bit hard to understand
[01:52:56] I'm going to try and talk my way through it.
[01:53:00] Because while you can't change the past, what you can change is you can absolutely change
[01:53:09] the way that the past is perceived.
[01:53:16] So let me give you a detached example.
[01:53:19] Just another example.
[01:53:20] If you had an individual, someone gets fired from a job.
[01:53:25] They get fired from their job and when they get fired from the job, it what it does is
[01:53:32] their confidence goes down and they get depressed and they decide they're not going to
[01:53:36] apply for a new job because I don't even know if I deserve it to get a new job and they
[01:53:39] sit around and eventually they go on apply for kind of like a lesser job.
[01:53:46] And you know who knows, maybe they start drinking to relieve some of their depression and
[01:53:50] now they're late and now they end up on a downward spiral.
[01:53:54] He would look at them being fired as something that destroyed them in ruining their life.
[01:54:01] That's how we would perceive it.
[01:54:03] Hey, the individual got, they were, they were doing fine.
[01:54:06] Then they got fired and now they lost their confidence and got depressed.
[01:54:09] They started drinking.
[01:54:10] They didn't apply for good jobs.
[01:54:12] And now their life is totally different and it's a bad place.
[01:54:16] We would perceive that them getting fired did that to them.
[01:54:23] But if that person, if a person got fired from their job and in, in steady, was like
[01:54:28] a wake up call for them.
[01:54:31] And they immediately applied for a bunch of other jobs and maybe they didn't get those
[01:54:36] because they had just been fired but maybe they took a lesser job, a lower paying job but
[01:54:40] they got in there and they had realized they had made a mistake and they started getting
[01:54:44] after that like they never gotten after it before.
[01:54:48] They started working as hard as they possibly could and got promoted and they got
[01:54:52] promoted again and just dominated in those positions and went even harder and dominated
[01:54:58] even more and eventually took over their whole company.
[01:55:03] And this isn't crazy.
[01:55:04] This isn't too far fetched.
[01:55:06] This can happen.
[01:55:07] But if that happened, that same incident, the firing of this individual would be perceived
[01:55:15] in a totally different way.
[01:55:16] It would be perceived as a catalyst that changed their life for the better.
[01:55:26] And there are all kinds of examples like that in the world.
[01:55:34] The past can't be changed.
[01:55:39] What the past can change you for the better or it can change you for the worse and my
[01:55:47] question is why not make it for the better?
[01:55:54] Why not make the past change you for the better?
[01:55:57] You hear the term narrative thrown around these days, especially like in political circles
[01:56:05] you'll hear it on the news that narratives they're created in the political arena.
[01:56:13] And what the narrative does is it supports an overarching aim or an overarching value or an
[01:56:21] overarching goal.
[01:56:24] That's the way people use the term narrative right now.
[01:56:28] But I'm not talking about that type of political narrative.
[01:56:33] What I'm saying here is that you actually write the narrative of what happened in your past.
[01:56:44] I'm not talking about a fabrication of it.
[01:56:46] I'm talking you get the right, the narrative of where it takes you.
[01:56:50] You get to write the narrative, you get to write the reality of where you end up.
[01:56:57] You get to write it.
[01:57:01] You get to control it.
[01:57:06] So what I'm saying is control it.
[01:57:11] Get control of that narrative.
[01:57:15] Take control of that narrative.
[01:57:18] That horrible story in your past ends the way that you want it to end.
[01:57:24] You control the narrative.
[01:57:27] You control that story.
[01:57:28] You'll make that story good.
[01:57:34] Make that story epic.
[01:57:36] Make that story and make the direction that your life goes.
[01:57:42] Make it.
[01:57:44] And really.
[01:57:53] And that's how I think you can get control.
[01:57:58] Or maybe handle better some of that horrific stuff that you've been through.
[01:58:09] And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[01:58:14] So echo Charles speaking of being heroic speaking of controlling our own narrative
[01:58:25] of the past of the present of the future.
[01:58:28] What can we do to write that heroic story for ourselves?
[01:58:36] Yes.
[01:58:37] Well, let's start with the path.
[01:58:41] We're staying on the path.
[01:58:42] We're going to get on the path.
[01:58:44] We're going to be on the path.
[01:58:46] So part of the path is due to, of course, like we've said many times.
[01:58:51] You're going to need a key.
[01:58:52] What do you get?
[01:58:53] I got to interview the other day.
[01:58:55] Cool.
[01:58:56] And the guy kind of sets up this kind of big question.
[01:59:02] He says, you know, in this day and age.
[01:59:04] And I'm not going to do injustice.
[01:59:05] He was a great question.
[01:59:06] It was a nice question.
[01:59:07] I get it.
[01:59:08] And I'm not going to do this eloquently as he did it.
[01:59:12] But the question was about, you know, in this day and age, when men and it was one of those
[01:59:19] like men like type things.
[01:59:22] If they're in age when men can be isolated and can get depressed and don't have
[01:59:27] meaning and all this stuff.
[01:59:29] What do you recommend to men that feel that way, that feel isolated and feel alone
[01:59:34] and feel depressed and feel like they don't have meaning in their life and feel like
[01:59:37] they can't connect with anyone.
[01:59:38] And I was like, oh, cool.
[01:59:39] Yeah, go to Gigietsu classes.
[01:59:41] And I felt bad because they wanted me to give like the big, profound thing about where
[01:59:49] the find meaning in your life.
[01:59:52] And what I said was, yeah, start training Gigietsu because the thing that you grab me
[01:59:55] with is like, oh, you want, you want to have a goal, you want to have meaning, you want
[01:59:59] to connect with people, you don't want to be alone, loneliness and all this stuff.
[02:00:02] I'm like, yeah, yeah, go change Gigietsu.
[02:00:04] Oh, there's problems.
[02:00:05] Get solved right there.
[02:00:06] Right.
[02:00:07] All of a sudden, you got people to hang out with.
[02:00:08] You got a mission.
[02:00:09] You got fitness going on.
[02:00:11] You got meaning.
[02:00:12] It's all kinds of good stuff going on.
[02:00:14] Yeah.
[02:00:15] So go train some Gigietsu is what I'm saying.
[02:00:17] Yeah.
[02:00:18] So start, that's one of those deals to with, you like, you leave Gigietsu with something.
[02:00:24] I'm not just fitness and better health and stuff.
[02:00:27] You leave with like a skill that just feeds into your whole soul, especially man,
[02:00:32] manliness thing, man, the capability to defeat another man.
[02:00:38] Yeah.
[02:00:39] And we'll have to see we'll check in with some of our females because when I talk to our
[02:00:44] female Gigietsu practitioners, they might even feel a little bit better because they
[02:00:50] get to like choke men.
[02:00:53] No doubt about it.
[02:00:54] So yeah.
[02:00:56] Yeah.
[02:00:57] So what we're saying basically is try training some Gigietsu.
[02:01:00] Look, is it a cure all?
[02:01:01] Yeah.
[02:01:02] Kind of.
[02:01:03] Yeah, little bit.
[02:01:04] For certain people in certain situations, I think, yeah, I think so.
[02:01:08] I have a feeling when I leave Gigietsu after I get done training.
[02:01:13] That I feel good.
[02:01:14] Yes, sir.
[02:01:15] Just think about that.
[02:01:17] Just think about think if I gave you a pill that said, oh, if you just take this pill, you'll
[02:01:20] feel good.
[02:01:21] You just, you just roundlead, you'll just feel good.
[02:01:25] But there's no, in fact, the only side effects are that you'll be a little healthier
[02:01:29] and you'll have a quality skill that you can utilize in the real world.
[02:01:36] Just take this pill.
[02:01:37] Would you take the pill?
[02:01:39] Who wouldn't?
[02:01:41] What I'm saying is you get to go to Gigietsu.
[02:01:44] Is it harder than taking a pill?
[02:01:46] Sure.
[02:01:47] But is it harder to eat a staker to eat a pill?
[02:01:50] Stake.
[02:01:51] Technically, it's harder to eat a staker.
[02:01:53] Which one would you rather do?
[02:01:54] Eat a staker.
[02:01:55] I'd rather eat a staker.
[02:01:56] I'd rather change a Gigietsu than take a pill.
[02:01:58] Me too.
[02:01:59] So get on that train.
[02:02:00] But you just do train.
[02:02:01] Get on the Gigietsu train.
[02:02:02] And you're going to do Gianno Gigi.
[02:02:03] So what kind of Gigiet to get?
[02:02:04] You get the best Gigi.
[02:02:06] Question.
[02:02:07] I realized I like dramatically interrupting you sometimes.
[02:02:10] Good.
[02:02:11] I dig it to sometimes.
[02:02:12] So Gigi, origin.
[02:02:17] OriginMain.com.
[02:02:18] This is where you can get your Gigi.
[02:02:21] Many different options.
[02:02:23] They come out with new ones as pretty cool.
[02:02:25] It's very creative with that stuff.
[02:02:28] I encourage P to continue that creativity.
[02:02:30] And keep it on that level as well.
[02:02:32] Anyway.
[02:02:33] Don't encourage him.
[02:02:34] Not an encourage.
[02:02:35] All encourage and compliment as well.
[02:02:38] So yes, originMain.com.
[02:02:40] You can get a rash card too if you want.
[02:02:43] Also some shirts on there, some joggers and whatnot.
[02:02:47] Supplements as well.
[02:02:49] What about just for what if you're going to go see a movie?
[02:02:52] Can you wear your Gitu a movie?
[02:02:53] Oh well.
[02:02:56] No.
[02:02:57] Okay.
[02:02:58] Can you wear your Gitu a dinner date with your wife?
[02:03:02] No.
[02:03:03] I know.
[02:03:04] You can't.
[02:03:05] So what do we do with origin then?
[02:03:06] All right.
[02:03:07] Well, the good news is we got some American denim.
[02:03:11] We got jeans.
[02:03:13] Yeah, origin jeans.
[02:03:15] Boom.
[02:03:16] Yeah, those are good man.
[02:03:17] Those came out really, really good.
[02:03:18] I think those are going to go to go places.
[02:03:22] This one I will give Pete some leeway for his creativity.
[02:03:29] Or if.
[02:03:30] Because he did this thing with the yoke of the jeans.
[02:03:32] You know the yoke is?
[02:03:33] No.
[02:03:34] It's like right below the waistband.
[02:03:37] And there's two types of different yokes you can have.
[02:03:39] Reverse yoke or regular yoke, I guess it's called.
[02:03:42] Anyways, it makes it so that the pants fit a certain way.
[02:03:46] And then he lined up the tops of the pockets with the reverse yoke, which means that
[02:03:51] they're slanted a little bit.
[02:03:53] Like the old school Vietnam pockets.
[02:03:57] So anyways, that's cool.
[02:04:00] They're legit.
[02:04:01] Yeah, they're just like a little bit.
[02:04:03] You know what I got there and tails going on.
[02:04:05] I'm gathering that you're starting to appreciate Pete's fashion sense.
[02:04:08] That's what I'm gathering.
[02:04:09] Great.
[02:04:10] You're saying occasionally, no, no, no, no, because here's the deal.
[02:04:13] The pockets because they're at a little angle, they're easier to get your hand
[02:04:18] in an out of, which what I'm saying is there is a functionality.
[02:04:24] Because if it wasn't functional, I wouldn't be talking about it right now.
[02:04:27] No.
[02:04:28] Because we don't talk about things like that.
[02:04:29] But they look dope this one saying.
[02:04:31] Yeah, thank you, sir.
[02:04:34] And appreciate that on a lot of things.
[02:04:35] I think Pete did it not for functionality.
[02:04:37] I think Pete did it because it looked cool.
[02:04:40] And then I commend his creativity because not because it looked cool, but because it
[02:04:47] provides a level of functionality that does not previously exist in jeans anywhere.
[02:04:52] Boom.
[02:04:53] So I agree with you.
[02:04:55] I agree with the whole deal, the whole gig and man.
[02:04:58] Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:59] Those are good American denim.
[02:05:01] But they're all made in America.
[02:05:02] Yes.
[02:05:03] The cotton is made in America.
[02:05:04] Grown.
[02:05:05] What about the things that you put, you're fast in the, you're waste with the buttons?
[02:05:09] Yeah, the buttons.
[02:05:10] We're in buttons in.
[02:05:13] Just look at a picture of the buttons.
[02:05:15] That's enough to be like all sold to begin with.
[02:05:18] They're pretty dope.
[02:05:19] They're very dope.
[02:05:20] Actually, plus we got supplements as you were just about to say.
[02:05:22] Yes, supplements.
[02:05:23] Important supplements.
[02:05:24] Not this mega mast.
[02:05:26] What was that one from old school?
[02:05:28] Mega mast.
[02:05:29] I don't know.
[02:05:30] It was a big number.
[02:05:31] The last, not like that.
[02:05:32] Well, I guess kind of because milk is additional, but wait, cleaner, clean, protein, slow release.
[02:05:39] Brighten did a really good, um, but let's face it.
[02:05:43] It just tastes good.
[02:05:44] Yes.
[02:05:45] Well, it doesn't just taste it.
[02:05:46] It tastes good.
[02:05:47] That might be, uh, what's that word?
[02:05:50] That might be the number one priority or the number one benefit.
[02:05:53] The fact that it's the best protein you can actually get is awesome too.
[02:05:57] Yeah.
[02:05:58] Cool.
[02:05:58] You need to take if you want protein as well.
[02:06:00] So there's, there's very good always eat a steak.
[02:06:03] That's the problem.
[02:06:04] Sometimes you're like on the go.
[02:06:05] Sometimes you got to get.
[02:06:07] Sometimes it's, you got work to do.
[02:06:09] Yeah.
[02:06:10] You have time to eat a steak.
[02:06:11] Sometimes you just want to dessert too.
[02:06:12] Let's face it.
[02:06:13] Come on bro, let's face it.
[02:06:15] So boom.
[02:06:16] There you go.
[02:06:17] So yeah, some milk is like that, but the joint warfare, krill oil, these are for
[02:06:21] your joints.
[02:06:22] Keep your joints in the game.
[02:06:23] If you're for real getting after it, like, especially in the gym and doing judi-to, man,
[02:06:28] those, the joint warfare and the krill oil is going to keep you in the game big times.
[02:06:32] It's going to help you out alive.
[02:06:33] Huge time as we say.
[02:06:36] Don't forget about the warrior kid milk as well.
[02:06:38] Yeah.
[02:06:39] Which is, which is tasty.
[02:06:41] And why not feed your kid something that's actually going to be good for them instead of feeding
[02:06:47] them literal poison.
[02:06:50] Yeah.
[02:06:51] Come me bears.
[02:06:52] Yeah.
[02:06:53] Sugar for a shock.
[02:06:54] Correct.
[02:06:55] Discipline as well.
[02:06:59] If you want some cognitive enhancing elements infused into your brain, get some discipline.
[02:07:02] That's a good one.
[02:07:03] Get yourself some jocquoise tea as well.
[02:07:05] Yeah.
[02:07:06] That's if you want to have a massive deadlift and excessive 8,000 pounds.
[02:07:10] Check.
[02:07:11] Yeah.
[02:07:12] Also, it's certified organic.

[02:07:14] Also, what the store?
[02:07:16] It's called jocquoise store.

[02:07:26] If you want to represent on the path, this will even get after it.
[02:07:31] Simple stuff.

[02:07:38] Sure.
[02:07:39] So when you get this shirt, it should be.
[02:07:42] As it should be.
[02:07:43] Right.
[02:07:44] So if you get this shirt and you recognize that dang, this could very well be my favorite
[02:07:48] shirt just to wear.
[02:07:49] Just the fit in the field.
[02:07:51] The shirt.
[02:07:52] I won't be surprised.

[02:10:38] But it's like one, two, maybe three levels higher than the poster.
[02:10:41] It's like, you know, the pen you hang on your wall in your home.
[02:10:44] You've got it in your office.
[02:10:46] Clearly, you could put these things up there.
[02:10:48] We got some warrior kid posters, art, and as well.
[02:10:53] They're not just posters.
[02:10:54] They're like, yeah, the quality.

[02:11:06] So you know, some cool supplements, some greens, some food items.
[02:11:10] You know, this is where I get my kettlebells.
[02:11:12] But actually, yeah, like pretty much all my home gym stuff aside from like the dumbbells
[02:11:17] sets.
[02:11:18] Get from on it.

[02:11:39] mission.
[02:11:40] These books are good.
[02:11:41] And these are the books I wish I had when I was a kid.
[02:11:43] They would just put me on the path that a younger age.
[02:11:46] Like in the dragons, you can order that one now as well.
[02:11:51] That is for a little bit younger age, maybe three, four, five, six.
[02:11:57] Sure, through 70.
[02:11:58] Yeah, I would agree with that.
[02:12:00] Yeah, just want to go to Freedom Field Manual.
