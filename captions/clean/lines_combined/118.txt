00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.26 This is Jocopotcast number 18.
00:00:04.26 --> 00:00:07.36 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:08.32 Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.32 --> 00:00:09.32 Good evening.
00:00:12.32 --> 00:00:13.76 I need a mission.
00:00:16.20 --> 00:00:18.64 We all need a mission.
00:00:20.48 --> 00:00:24.48 That's what life should be is a mission.
00:00:24.48 --> 00:00:32.72 That's what gives your life, purpose and focus and drive and ultimately
00:00:34.24 --> 00:00:35.24 satisfaction.
00:00:37.28 --> 00:00:41.12 Now, that mission can be the job you work at.
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:46.88 It can be providing for your family or it can be getting better at you,
00:00:46.88 --> 00:00:52.64 Jitsu or stronger at Olympic lifting or starting a business that you want to grow and
00:00:52.64 --> 00:00:54.40 build and take over the world.
00:00:57.60 --> 00:01:02.80 And sometimes people ask me what to do if they don't know what their mission is
00:01:02.80 --> 00:01:04.52 or what their mission should be.
00:01:07.44 --> 00:01:12.56 And I tell them if they're in that situation to go help someone.
00:01:14.16 --> 00:01:16.24 Go help someone else make that your mission.
00:01:17.60 --> 00:01:19.60 Because that will make you better.
00:01:19.60 --> 00:01:22.56 And it'll make the world better.
00:01:23.84 --> 00:01:26.80 And eventually from that, you'll see what your mission is.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000 Now, I was lucky.
00:01:35.36 --> 00:01:39.68 Because from a young age, I had a mission.
00:01:41.92 --> 00:01:44.000 I wanted to be some kind of commando.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.16 And eventually I ended up pairing about the seal teams and decided that that was
00:01:53.36 --> 00:01:55.36 the best place for me.
00:01:57.44 --> 00:01:59.04 And that's where I went.
00:02:00.40 --> 00:02:03.20 And once I got to the seal teams, I had a new mission.
00:02:05.12 --> 00:02:08.32 Which was to prepare for war and that's what we did.
00:02:08.32 --> 00:02:15.76 And then eventually war came.
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:25.68 And then that was the mission to take the fight to the enemy, to close with and destroy them
00:02:25.68 --> 00:02:27.20 through close combat.
00:02:27.20 --> 00:02:28.72 And that's what we did.
00:02:28.72 --> 00:02:42.56 But eventually for me and for everyone in the military, it ends.
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:50.40 Maybe because of retirement or maybe because of family obligations or maybe
00:02:50.40 --> 00:03:00.72 for medical reasons, but for every warrior eventually the war ends.
00:03:00.72 --> 00:03:02.88 And that career ends and that mission ends.
00:03:06.56 --> 00:03:12.24 And I've talked a lot on this podcast about how important it is to find a new mission.
00:03:12.24 --> 00:03:21.60 Once the war is over for you and you've done your part, you have to find a new mission.
00:03:26.40 --> 00:03:34.08 Well, tonight we have a guest on who pursued much the same mission as me
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:43.52 for as long as he could and who has now found a new mission that he is on.
00:03:45.60 --> 00:03:50.48 So Dan Crenshaw, welcome to the podcast.
00:03:50.48 --> 00:03:52.56 Thanks, Jack Oates, pleasure to be here with you.
00:03:52.56 --> 00:03:54.48 We're a lot of thanks for coming on.
00:03:55.28 --> 00:04:01.52 And let's just start at the beginning a little bit for people that don't know who you are.
00:04:01.52 --> 00:04:07.36 Let's talk a little bit about, I guess we'll talk about Katie Texas and at the same time,
00:04:07.36 --> 00:04:12.72 also include Ecuador and Colombia about your childhood.
00:04:12.72 --> 00:04:13.44 Absolutely.
00:04:14.32 --> 00:04:17.12 Well, like you said, I grew up in Katie Texas.
00:04:17.68 --> 00:04:22.64 I've had six generations of Texan flowing through me, my dad's side of the family.
00:04:23.36 --> 00:04:26.48 And my dad was in the oil and gas industry our whole lives.
00:04:26.48 --> 00:04:32.96 So when you hear the things about Ecuador and Colombia and even Egypt and Scotland, that's
00:04:32.96 --> 00:04:38.48 those are all the places we lived over the years because of his career.
00:04:38.48 --> 00:04:41.44 Everybody in the oil and gas industry in Texas knows that.
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:42.72 It's a pretty common theme.
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:48.48 I like to talk about some of the challenges that I went through from an early age.
00:04:49.28 --> 00:04:56.32 And what drove me, maybe drove my that that passed that mental capacity that you need
00:04:56.32 --> 00:04:57.60 to become a seal.
00:04:57.60 --> 00:05:04.000 And that started with my mother and my mother got diagnosed with breast cancer and I was five
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000 years old and she fought it hard for five years and she never quit, she never complained.
00:05:10.88 --> 00:05:15.84 I never saw it and if she did, I never saw it and she just took care of me and my brother.
00:05:16.64 --> 00:05:19.12 Every day, right up until the end.
00:05:19.12 --> 00:05:23.12 And she eventually lost that battle when I was 10 years old, 1994.
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:31.92 But she instilled in me, you know, what I think are American and Texas values of integrity,
00:05:32.88 --> 00:05:39.04 respect and just never quit, never quit no matter what and don't feel sorry for yourself.
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:42.56 Because she never did, she truly never did.
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.000 And she asked where she told me before she died that I would sort of great heights.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.76 And I don't know what that meant at the time.
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:56.32 But I think we know now. And not long after that, you know, when I could start reading books
00:05:56.32 --> 00:06:03.84 and and grab the first Navy seal, Dick Marcinto novel, Rogue Warrior,
00:06:04.80 --> 00:06:06.40 that I could your book wasn't out yet.
00:06:06.40 --> 00:06:07.36 Draco otherwise.
00:06:07.36 --> 00:06:08.000 Maybe I'll.
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:12.24 Yeah, Rogue Warrior that that that came out when I was already in.
00:06:12.24 --> 00:06:16.48 Yeah, and the matter fact, it came out right as I showed up at the teams.
00:06:16.48 --> 00:06:22.000 It I'm pretty sure that's right when it came out. And obviously it created some turmoil in the
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.52 teams, but it was pretty interesting, especially because I knew guys that had work for Dick Marcinto.
00:06:27.52 --> 00:06:33.28 And that was pretty interesting to talk to them. And to be totally frank with you, most of the
00:06:33.28 --> 00:06:39.76 guys that worked for Dick Marcinto loved him. And as a matter fact, one of the couple of the guys
00:06:39.76 --> 00:06:44.32 that I respect, I met, there's one guy as a matter fact that that I work for.
00:06:44.32 --> 00:06:49.52 And this was a couple years later. It's a matter fact it was around 1994, because I was in a
00:06:49.52 --> 00:06:54.08 seal puto and I was talking to this guy that had worked for Dick Marcinto. And I said,
00:06:54.08 --> 00:06:57.60 hey, you know how was Dick Marcinto? How was it to work for him?
00:06:58.24 --> 00:07:03.76 He looked at me as a best CEO ever. Yeah. And this was from a guy that I have utmost respect for.
00:07:03.76 --> 00:07:08.24 So I thought that was pretty cool. Even though, you know, his book, you know, the book is,
00:07:08.24 --> 00:07:14.40 it's, I'd say it's a Hollywood-ish book. Yeah. And, and, you know, the statement in there that
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:19.28 everyone always laughs about in the teams is the statement that every seal on his team could bench
00:07:19.28 --> 00:07:24.72 press 500 pounds. Right. Right. The number came to growing. We're not going, we're not even going
00:07:24.72 --> 00:07:27.36 to make it real listening. We're not going to make it real listening. We're not going to make it real
00:07:27.36 --> 00:07:32.24 listening. We're just going straight to 500 pounds everyone on the team. Right. And that's just
00:07:32.24 --> 00:07:38.64 a patently untrue. And what sucks is when you do that with that thing, well, then people start
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:42.88 looking at the book and go to what is true and what is not. Right. So, and although, from the way
00:07:42.88 --> 00:07:48.80 it's been described to me, the events in that book, a lot of them are compiled. So, like this little
00:07:48.80 --> 00:07:51.92 thing happened on a training event, this thing happened on a training event, this thing happened
00:07:51.92 --> 00:07:55.84 on a training event, but they'd all be compiled into one big story. And yeah. So it's kind of like a
00:07:55.84 --> 00:08:02.80 Hollywood. Yeah. It's a book. It's a nonfiction-ish story. 10-year-old bandcredsch, I didn't know that.
00:08:02.80 --> 00:08:09.84 You was like, I'm going to bench 500 pounds. No problem. Yeah. You know, I wouldn't be here without
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:14.64 that series of books. Frankly, you know, I probably still have two eyes, but nobody's
00:08:14.64 --> 00:08:22.88 used to eyes. That's a luxury. We'll get to that in a little bit. So, yeah, I mean, that,
00:08:22.88 --> 00:08:28.96 you know, once you've once that and you know this, most seals operate this way, or at least they
00:08:28.96 --> 00:08:35.20 have the same story of, yeah, it was just from a young age. I had a mission. I knew what it was
00:08:35.20 --> 00:08:41.92 and every decision I made from, from then until the moment I got into Buds was just prepared for that.
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:48.16 Now, when you, did you, I know you lived overseas? Where did you go to high school?
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:52.72 So, most of high school in Colombia. Okay. Yeah. And, uh, did you play sports down there?
00:08:52.72 --> 00:08:55.68 I played soccer. Okay. Yeah. Because you were in Colombia. Yeah. So, you're in the place of
00:08:55.68 --> 00:09:00.96 kind of like what they had. You're in a place of soccer. It was that or volleyball.
00:09:00.96 --> 00:09:06.000 Yeah. It was like a play volleyball. And then, if you applied from college from Colombia,
00:09:06.40 --> 00:09:10.000 yeah. And okay, this is, this is kind of an important question because a lot of people
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.56 asked me this question all the time. You were definitely wanted to be a seal. What made you make the
00:09:14.56 --> 00:09:20.24 decision between going to college and you ended up going to Tufts? Yeah. And then in most of
00:09:20.24 --> 00:09:27.44 in Massachusetts. So, at some point you said to yourself, okay, I could enlist tomorrow and go to
00:09:27.44 --> 00:09:36.40 boot camp and, you know, be a seal within the year. Or I can go to college for four years and, you know,
00:09:36.40 --> 00:09:41.36 then apply and I'll be in an, on officer in a leadership position. I could ask that question all
00:09:41.36 --> 00:09:48.000 time. For me, when I was 18 years old, the answer was real easy. Like, oh, I can be a seal within a year.
00:09:48.40 --> 00:09:53.68 Sign me up. Yeah. And, and that's what I did. And for you, you obviously took a different approach.
00:09:54.40 --> 00:09:58.24 And people asked me all the time, which one is better. And I, I tell them that there's advantages
00:09:58.24 --> 00:10:02.96 and disadvantages to both of them. But what made you decide you're going to go officer style from the
00:10:02.96 --> 00:10:08.72 get go? Maybe, you know, along with my mission of being a seal, my whole life,
00:10:08.72 --> 00:10:13.44 the similar mission of I wanted a college degree as well. I wanted to knock that out.
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:19.68 And, and then, you know, I wasn't well informed enough to really speak about the
00:10:19.68 --> 00:10:24.08 difference between officer and enlisted back then. Like, I am now. But I did want a leadership role.
00:10:24.08 --> 00:10:29.12 It was important to me based on what I'd read and based on the movies I'd seen that I
00:10:29.52 --> 00:10:34.64 wasn't a leadership role. Did you see Navy seals? Was that obviously? That's like,
00:10:34.64 --> 00:10:38.80 if that's a late babbling's answer to why you came a seal straight up. Yeah. Yeah, totally seals,
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:46.16 Charlie Sheen gets on it. Yeah. So, I bet I didn't just see it. You know, we had it on all the time.
00:10:47.44 --> 00:10:53.12 Okay, this movie ever. Yeah, you know, it's so a combination of wanting a leadership role.
00:10:53.76 --> 00:10:59.12 Maybe knowing to, you know, was I really ready at age 18? You know, I know I wanted it.
00:10:59.12 --> 00:11:04.08 But I have also, I also wanted to be prepared. Yeah. And it was able to think ahead enough to know
00:11:04.08 --> 00:11:09.60 that maybe I can't swim all that great just yet. We might need some more practice. Yeah.
00:11:09.60 --> 00:11:16.32 But it was mostly like, it was mostly, I'm going to go to college first. That's then my life path.
00:11:16.32 --> 00:11:22.48 That's what I'm going to do. And so that's what I did. And yeah, and then I bet Tufts University,
00:11:22.48 --> 00:11:28.32 mostly because of its international relations program. That was my focus. It was foreign affairs,
00:11:28.32 --> 00:11:35.36 international relations, politics, and I did a minor in physics just because why not? Yeah.
00:11:35.36 --> 00:11:41.12 Because that sounds like fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you, you speak Spanish obviously from growing up
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:44.000 in Columbia too. So you are you fluent in Spanish? Pretty fluent. Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000 Yeah. Now it's got a little rusty, but we're, we can get. And you did ROTC at,
00:11:48.80 --> 00:11:54.000 yes, was there any seals there? Like prior seals that were instructors or anything like that?
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.40 No. I, well, no, there was at Harvard. So a lot of these guys doing master's programs while we're
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:04.24 doing ROTC. They're not attached to the unit, but I did have the opportunity to work with some guys.
00:12:04.96 --> 00:12:11.76 And you know, just get that mentorship. This is the kind of work out you might want to be doing.
00:12:11.76 --> 00:12:15.36 I mean, just the basics because you just have no idea. Yeah. I'm into it. Do you think
00:12:15.36 --> 00:12:24.88 kids over prepare for Buds now? I think it depends on the kid. I often mentor guys who want to go
00:12:24.88 --> 00:12:29.68 through and you know, that sometimes they do focus a little bit too much on, especially things
00:12:29.68 --> 00:12:33.20 they're good at. Yeah. Like I'm running 10 miles a day. It's going to like a five minute
00:12:33.20 --> 00:12:38.64 pace. Some like stop running. Never run again. Yeah. You're good at that. Move on to the next thing.
00:12:39.36 --> 00:12:43.68 You know, focus on your weaknesses. Guys just don't understand the little, little basics. I don't know
00:12:43.68 --> 00:12:48.72 if they over train. I haven't worked with enough to really know. I talked to people and they
00:12:48.72 --> 00:12:55.44 send me messages all the time and they're on this two year training program to get ready for Buds.
00:12:55.44 --> 00:13:01.52 And I'm like, hey, train for two months and then go, no, it's not that hard. If you played a
00:13:01.52 --> 00:13:06.24 sport in college or you played a sport in high school and you can run like you'll get in good
00:13:06.24 --> 00:13:10.24 shape there and it's going to be a challenge. But waiting around, especially when there's a war
00:13:10.24 --> 00:13:14.80 going on that you don't really want to miss. Yeah. Like that's a big deal to me. You know, and I tell
00:13:14.80 --> 00:13:20.88 these guys, this war's not going to last forever. And you know, I showed up at the team in 1991,
00:13:20.88 --> 00:13:27.04 just missed the first call for it. And it's, you know, I didn't shoot my weapon at the enemy for 13
00:13:27.04 --> 00:13:35.12 years. And that's a long, dry, hard 13 years. And so, yeah, you don't miss out on that. No, you don't.
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:43.28 One of my old team guy buddies. It was like 1971 and and he, the V, thought the V at
00:13:43.28 --> 00:13:47.52 NOMOR was going to end and he's down at the Marine Corps recruiter saying, I want to be a door
00:13:47.52 --> 00:13:53.68 cutter, he we. It's interesting that there's, you know, you always hear about the protesters
00:13:53.68 --> 00:14:02.32 and whatnot. But there's kids that want to fight. Oh, yeah. We do have a, there's a warrior class
00:14:02.32 --> 00:14:06.24 in, in America that I think we should be proud of and it'd be proud to be a part of because
00:14:06.24 --> 00:14:10.88 it's a, for good people with good values and they want to do the right thing for the country.
00:14:10.88 --> 00:14:16.24 So you show up at butts. So you get to be good done with college, college is college, right?
00:14:16.24 --> 00:14:20.32 Is there anything particularly you want to say about college? No. Okay. Well, cool.
00:14:20.32 --> 00:14:22.32 Because I'll particularly want to hear about it.
00:14:22.32 --> 00:14:32.48 Yeah, college happened. Yeah, college happened. And so you show up at butts and any issues at butts?
00:14:32.48 --> 00:14:39.60 Yeah. You know, I started my, I started with class two, six, one. About Tuesday afternoon of my first
00:14:39.60 --> 00:14:46.000 hell week, my stress fracture developed into a pretty noticeable fracture. And I got the old
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.44 question, are you hurt? Or are you injured, Mr. Crenshaw? And you really want to be injured because
00:14:51.44 --> 00:14:56.48 you better not just be hurt because then you're just quitting. And I was, I was injured.
00:14:56.48 --> 00:15:01.04 I was pretty substantially. I mean, you know, I mean, stress fractures are pretty normal,
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.56 injury and, and buds. Okay. So you, so when I'm sitting there talking about people don't prep
00:15:06.56 --> 00:15:10.24 enough, you're like, actually, you should prep more. Do you think you could run more for pairing for
00:15:10.24 --> 00:15:15.28 butts? I would have, I ran plenty. I would have, I would have focused a little bit more on
00:15:15.28 --> 00:15:21.44 strength and conditioning. You know, something I just didn't know how to do back then. Because
00:15:21.44 --> 00:15:25.52 what happens in butts is, I mean, you're going to go to failure. You're going to go to failure
00:15:25.52 --> 00:15:30.48 no matter what. And it's going to happen on the hour, every hour, maybe every 10 minutes, all the time.
00:15:30.48 --> 00:15:35.92 So the guys who overprepared, they, they, they can't understand why they're failing so much.
00:15:35.92 --> 00:15:40.24 Right? And that, that messes with their heads. Maybe that's what you mean by overprepared.
00:15:40.24 --> 00:15:45.04 Because that's what I mean by. Like, I think, I think guys get too confident in their abilities.
00:15:45.04 --> 00:15:50.08 And they just don't understand why they're hitting a wall all the time. Whereas like,
00:15:50.08 --> 00:15:55.04 guys like me or just like, I just, I just, I expected to suck. So it's really not a surprise.
00:15:55.84 --> 00:15:59.84 Or just going to keep trying, no matter what. And just never quit. And an, an, an quitting is never an
00:15:59.84 --> 00:16:04.88 option. The other problem is if you overprepared, it, it, it may be it becomes an option. This isn't
00:16:04.88 --> 00:16:09.12 the case for everybody. But I see some of the best in shape guys quit because it was just,
00:16:09.12 --> 00:16:13.60 they were like, maybe it was an option for them. Like, maybe I'll make it, maybe I won't. But if you,
00:16:13.60 --> 00:16:19.60 you should never go into buds thinking that way. And that's why a lot of guys who make it through,
00:16:19.60 --> 00:16:23.68 I think have this story that, well, I wanted to do it since I was 10 years old. So it was just never an
00:16:23.68 --> 00:16:29.92 option for me to ever quit. So yeah, you do need to prepare enough to make sure your, your muscles
00:16:29.92 --> 00:16:34.72 when they do fail aren't putting all the strain on your joints and your knees. And that's what happened to me
00:16:34.72 --> 00:16:39.04 because it just happened over time and over time and you're limping a certain way. And that just
00:16:39.04 --> 00:16:43.04 causes a fracture eventually because there's too much pressure being put on your bones. So,
00:16:43.60 --> 00:16:48.48 you know, or I just had a week genetics. Yeah, it's like, one story. Or it'll likely, yeah, it's
00:16:48.48 --> 00:16:53.76 here. So I, it's like I rolled back. I came back again with 264. And you know, you know,
00:16:53.76 --> 00:16:59.12 there's the, that two mile run you're doing how weak it's like Tuesday or so, if how weak and it's a
00:16:59.12 --> 00:17:04.96 time, you went through a long time. Well, it's like a Tuesday or something. It's a time to run. And if you,
00:17:04.96 --> 00:17:09.52 and if you get in the top five, you don't have to do it again. And then everybody else has to do it all
00:17:09.52 --> 00:17:14.16 over again. And you get to rest under a boat and, you know, eat sand or whatever they let you do.
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:22.32 Much on that sand over there. And you know, my first, how weak I was dead last. I mean, just
00:17:22.32 --> 00:17:27.44 way be like not even close, right? Because I was limping the whole time. And my second, how weak,
00:17:27.44 --> 00:17:32.80 I was, I was first placed by maybe five minutes, you know, and maybe because I knew what the
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:38.96 game was, but everybody does actually, the work gets around. You know, it's, but it was, it was,
00:17:38.96 --> 00:17:44.72 it was a message, maybe to myself of like, we're gonna, we're gonna not only do this, but we're gonna
00:17:44.72 --> 00:17:49.84 crush it. And I'm gonna feel good about it. I'm gonna rest under that boat and eat my sand.
00:17:49.84 --> 00:17:53.92 Well, everybody else is running. At the, at the, at the, at the frankly, it was really cold. So I kind of
00:17:53.92 --> 00:18:00.08 wish I'd been running at the time. But whatever I want. The closest story I have to that is we got
00:18:00.08 --> 00:18:06.000 done with a four mile time run. And when we got done, the people that failed and I didn't fail,
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.68 but there was a bunch of people that failed. And the instructor who is a really a perfect instructor
00:18:13.68 --> 00:18:21.04 meaning that his attitude and the way he cared himself was epic for Buds. And he was the senior chief of
00:18:21.04 --> 00:18:26.72 the phase, it was dive phase. And the guy's come across and he's collecting the guys that fail,
00:18:26.72 --> 00:18:32.08 which was probably at least half the class. And then you know, he says, you know, because I'm fair,
00:18:32.08 --> 00:18:36.88 I'm gonna go ahead and let you do this time run again. Get on the line, ready, go. And everyone
00:18:36.88 --> 00:18:40.48 had to run another four mile time run. Right. Well, not us, but the people that, the people that
00:18:40.48 --> 00:18:44.48 passed got to not know, but the people that didn't pass, which was half the class,
00:18:44.48 --> 00:18:48.64 had to go and just run another four mile time run right then to see if they could then pass it.
00:18:48.64 --> 00:18:57.20 Yeah, but she's going to pass. You have to put out as hard as you possibly could for a
00:18:57.20 --> 00:19:01.60 four mile time run, which I actually had to do every time. I failed to run and I failed one run
00:19:01.92 --> 00:19:06.40 in Buds. I I paced myself. I said, oh, you know what, I'll just pace myself. I'm not going to put
00:19:06.40 --> 00:19:11.60 out as hard as I as a kind. I'll save a little bit for later. And that didn't work. I failed,
00:19:11.60 --> 00:19:15.44 because I'm not a fast runner. And so from then on, it was just a sprint as hard as I could go
00:19:15.44 --> 00:19:24.80 for the whole damn time. Unlike you, I didn't win any races, good buds. So you get done with
00:19:24.80 --> 00:19:32.000 and you show up. So now it's 2000 what year is it? This is 2007. Okay. Yeah, 2007. Yeah,
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.60 finishing Buds 2007 in the moving NSQT. That's right. Life Babin, putting me through
00:19:37.60 --> 00:19:48.64 Jatsi. Nice. You know, I was I was I was I was indoctrinated early on. Yeah. Yeah, it's awesome.
00:19:48.64 --> 00:19:55.44 And then from there, you rolled to Team 3, Team 3. I was Team 3 with Felusion 2008 and then
00:19:55.44 --> 00:20:01.68 back in Mormati in 2010 with try to put in, you know, you're a little true. You know, going back
00:20:01.68 --> 00:20:06.48 to late for running that course. It was interesting because what that course used to be was almost
00:20:06.48 --> 00:20:11.84 like an administrator course. Hey, here's how you write e-viles and they had a little tiny bit of
00:20:11.84 --> 00:20:17.20 dashings of of tactics in it, but it was here's how you write e-viles. Here's how you write
00:20:17.20 --> 00:20:23.12 navy messages and just that kind of stuff. Yeah. And you know, we knew that these kids needed to
00:20:23.12 --> 00:20:28.24 train because in Ramaadiah had guys that were first platoon, guys out ground force commanders. Yeah.
00:20:28.24 --> 00:20:33.44 And we wanted to make sure these guys knew what to do on the battlefield and it was awesome
00:20:33.44 --> 00:20:37.60 that life went there and started rehashing that program and did a great job because it was very
00:20:37.60 --> 00:20:44.16 valuable. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah. So then you got done with that. Then you showed up at Team 3.
00:20:44.16 --> 00:20:49.28 And you went right on deployment. Right. I mean, Team 3 was already on deployment. So they just
00:20:49.28 --> 00:20:55.04 deployed, you know, and you know how that goes. It's the cycle of graduates. So we met up with Team 3.
00:20:55.04 --> 00:21:00.48 I was in Felusion for a little while. I was down in Bosor for a few months and actually stayed
00:21:00.48 --> 00:21:07.04 on deployment to meet up with Team 5 and and help them transition, you know, as we were setting
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:13.76 up another debt out there in Bosor. Great, great first deployment and learned a lot.
00:21:14.32 --> 00:21:21.36 Got to work a little bit and then came back to Iraq in 2010. And another great deployment for me
00:21:21.36 --> 00:21:26.08 because I was able to take over a Splatoon Commander when my platoon OIC had to go to
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:32.40 relieve another platoon OIC. So, you know, we were going through the entire targeting cycle,
00:21:32.40 --> 00:21:37.60 working with multiple Iraqi partners throughout Ramad, and throughout all of Alambar. We got to
00:21:37.60 --> 00:21:43.60 operate throughout the entire province, even a little bit in Baghdad. So just an amazing experience
00:21:43.60 --> 00:21:48.40 for a young J.O. who wouldn't normally be putting that position and working with some of the best
00:21:48.40 --> 00:21:54.24 people I've ever met. You know, we talked about before. I won't name names on the podcast. But,
00:21:54.24 --> 00:21:58.64 you know, well, your OIC was a great guy that got moved. That's why he got moved. And obviously,
00:21:58.64 --> 00:22:04.16 they had confidence in you to to move you up into the platoon commander position, which is an
00:22:04.16 --> 00:22:11.76 interesting thing. I had a group of business people and they, there was a guy that kept saying,
00:22:11.76 --> 00:22:15.68 well, no one can take my place, you know, and then he was surprised that he wasn't getting promoted.
00:22:16.72 --> 00:22:22.24 And, you know, explained to people, if you don't have a person below you in the chain of command,
00:22:22.24 --> 00:22:25.76 or two or three people below you in the chain of command, that can take your job. Well, then you're
00:22:25.76 --> 00:22:31.52 going to have to stay in your job and you're not going to get promoted. So that's proof that your OIC,
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:35.52 like I said, who's a great guy actually, he's supposed to come on the podcast at some point. But he's a
00:22:35.52 --> 00:22:43.52 great guy and he had groomed you and taught you everything he could do and made you ready and trusted
00:22:43.52 --> 00:22:47.44 you to say when the boss came to him and said, hey, I got a fire guy. I'm going to move you
00:22:47.44 --> 00:22:53.28 over to Afghanistan is your A OIC ready to take over and he could confidently say, yes, he is. And that's
00:22:53.28 --> 00:23:01.28 that's awesome. And that shows that he was a great leader to to kind of prepare you properly for that
00:23:01.28 --> 00:23:05.68 situation. That's a good point. I mean, that is part of leadership and management. It's making sure that
00:23:05.68 --> 00:23:11.36 below you and above you is squared away. Yeah, but I would put it. And I would do that when I was
00:23:11.36 --> 00:23:18.32 running training, I would always kill theoretically or what is it virtually kill the two or
00:23:18.32 --> 00:23:22.40 many years. You all of us. Yeah, and sometimes I'd kill all of you. Yeah, I remember.
00:23:24.72 --> 00:23:31.92 Yeah, there'd be some some some buddy carries happening for extended distances. Yeah, I was a little bit
00:23:33.12 --> 00:23:38.000 I was a little bit crazy at that point. And you know, I was a good training. Yeah, yeah,
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.48 you know, it's I was coming home from Ramadi and I wanted to make sure you guys were ready to
00:23:43.12 --> 00:23:49.92 ready for the worst possible case scenarios, you know. So then you get so you do that,
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:54.56 you finish out that deployment. That was a solid deployment. You were running a bunch of stuff.
00:23:54.56 --> 00:23:58.40 That sounds like a good deal. And then what did you do when you came back? So it came back
00:23:59.36 --> 00:24:05.36 moved over to support activity one. And as you know, they run intelligence support operations
00:24:05.36 --> 00:24:11.04 for the seal teams. It's a fairly normal transition to make as an officer. And for a lot of
00:24:11.04 --> 00:24:16.64 this guys too. But with that ended up what really, what that translated into is back on deployment
00:24:16.64 --> 00:24:22.48 2012 with my platoon again, seal team three, trial of the platoon, and can do hard province. So
00:24:23.28 --> 00:24:28.48 on that deployment, this was one of our more kinetic deployments. I mean, it's Afghanistan,
00:24:28.48 --> 00:24:34.40 it's can do hard, there's IEDs everywhere. I mean, everywhere. I mean to the point where, you know,
00:24:34.40 --> 00:24:40.08 our TTPs or, you know, our, our, our, our, our HIPs. So these are our standard operating procedures.
00:24:40.08 --> 00:24:44.96 We're, hey, we're on patrol. We're getting shot at. Don't even move. Don't even go, look for cover.
00:24:45.28 --> 00:24:49.60 Because as soon as you move, you hit an IED. I mean, they're, they're just, they're that
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.52 prevalent throughout the entire ground, not just on pathways, not just in doorways, in the most
00:24:55.52 --> 00:25:01.12 random of places. These guys are just burying these things at a whim, you know. And then it's,
00:25:01.12 --> 00:25:06.16 but it's chaos out there. And we know they're not that great at shooting at us. So would rather just take it.
00:25:06.16 --> 00:25:11.20 So I'm going to take a moment just to emphasize what you just said, because it's really important
00:25:11.20 --> 00:25:16.32 and not everyone will understand it the way you, the way you, uh, went over it quickly, almost from
00:25:16.32 --> 00:25:21.92 a tactical mindset. So I just want everyone to understand what he's, what he's saying is when at this
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:30.40 point, the IEDs were so bad that if you started getting shot at by the enemy, the obvious and
00:25:30.40 --> 00:25:37.52 common and practice that everyone in the world instinctively and by training has is you immediately
00:25:37.52 --> 00:25:42.72 hit the ground and seek cover. And you get behind a log, you get behind a piece of terrain, you find
00:25:42.72 --> 00:25:48.32 somewhere to hide from the bullets that are coming at you. And what Dan saying is during this deployment,
00:25:48.32 --> 00:25:53.76 the IED threat was so high that when the enemy started shooting at them, instead of finding
00:25:53.76 --> 00:26:00.80 cover to hide from the bullets, they would rather just stay put, probably take a knee, but not
00:26:00.80 --> 00:26:05.04 dive behind something because they likely, there was a likely chance that there was an IED there.
00:26:05.04 --> 00:26:13.36 Yep, that's that's crazy. It is. You know, we've, we've seen multiple guys get, get blown up
00:26:13.36 --> 00:26:19.36 and usually our partners, our Afghan partners who are patrolling with us, because, you know,
00:26:19.36 --> 00:26:25.12 maybe they're, they're just not as careful or maybe the equipment they're using to detect IEDs in
00:26:25.12 --> 00:26:28.80 the ground, they weren't using it properly, whatever the case may be, or maybe just because it's
00:26:28.80 --> 00:26:34.000 bad luck and they're just everywhere. You know, it's, and there's more, you had more Afghan
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.68 partners than Americans. Oh, by far, we would sometimes go in operations with about 100
00:26:39.68 --> 00:26:45.92 Afghans and maybe 12, 15 seals. Yeah, because that we're doing entire clearance operations
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:50.08 through villages, you know, where we're going house to house, or shaken hands, a little bit of
00:26:50.08 --> 00:26:55.28 shaken hands, it's a little bit of on security, you know, either defending ourselves or going on
00:26:55.28 --> 00:27:00.56 the offensive, it depends on the situation, but, you know, we round everybody up, we talked to them,
00:27:01.36 --> 00:27:06.64 you know, we meet with village elders, so it's, it's, it's, it's a little bit of your,
00:27:06.64 --> 00:27:11.60 your, I guess, your more typical and conventional warfare tactics, so we're trying to meet and
00:27:11.60 --> 00:27:19.52 greet the population while also, you know, being prepared for battle. And, and, but the hardest
00:27:19.52 --> 00:27:23.92 part of that was certainly the IED threat, you know, only single file lines, everything we ever learned
00:27:23.92 --> 00:27:31.52 and training of different formations and, you know, staggered, actual on whatever it is, it doesn't
00:27:31.52 --> 00:27:36.48 apply. It all, it all gets thrown out the window, because it's, it's only about single file,
00:27:36.48 --> 00:27:39.84 what has been cleared, what hasn't been cleared, and you could, you could, you could
00:27:39.84 --> 00:27:43.68 veer from that a little bit depending on what area you're in and can to harm, more mountainous
00:27:43.68 --> 00:27:49.44 areas, less IEDs, but even then, I've got a story, you know, these guys, some of our guys take a,
00:27:49.44 --> 00:27:54.48 take a point, take a, on the high ground, then a little hilltop, I mean, just in the middle of nowhere,
00:27:55.12 --> 00:28:00.88 I mean, middle of, no, I can't emphasize this enough, it is the middle of nowhere, right, and they
00:28:00.88 --> 00:28:06.96 sit down and this pop goes off, it was a blasting cap that went low order, which means it didn't
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:11.28 blow up the main charge, like a 15, 20 pound charge, it would have killed all three of them right
00:28:11.28 --> 00:28:16.96 then and there, and I mean, I want to say that again, middle of nowhere, there was no reason for
00:28:16.96 --> 00:28:21.92 there to the IED right there, but there was, this was out in the mountains, and this wasn't even
00:28:21.92 --> 00:28:27.92 in the, you know, the southern Canterhard district, which is, which is truly just a minefield everywhere,
00:28:27.92 --> 00:28:32.40 you know, so, you know, the Canterna emphasized how bad the threat is there, and even even
00:28:32.40 --> 00:28:38.48 taking, even taking a small high ground position behind a rock, you know, this is what the kind
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:46.88 of things we ran into, and so that was that deployment, it was a lot of fun, but it was, it was a
00:28:46.88 --> 00:28:56.88 hard one for us, you know, on month six, that's six months since June 15th, 2012, I was hit by an IED
00:28:56.88 --> 00:29:01.44 blast by one of these, you know, again, there everywhere, it was, it was the one day we spent in
00:29:01.44 --> 00:29:07.28 Helman Province, so we went to Helman on an, on an elastment admission to support some marine
00:29:07.28 --> 00:29:14.48 special operations forces out there, and as, as the early, you know, we always fly in about the
00:29:14.48 --> 00:29:19.60 middle of the night, we do that so that the enemy can't arm the IED, so the IEDs are everywhere,
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:24.000 but they're not always armed, and if they, if they keep them armed, they run out of batteries,
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.20 and they don't work anymore, so they, so there's, there's a little bit of tactical consideration there,
00:29:29.20 --> 00:29:36.72 but, you know, and as the early morning hours come and the daylight starts to hit, we start to move
00:29:36.72 --> 00:29:42.72 around, and we start to clear out this one compound, and hadn't been totally clear jet, and one
00:29:42.72 --> 00:29:49.12 of my Afghan interpreters was responding to a call, runs in front of me, and completely gets
00:29:49.12 --> 00:29:54.64 dismembered by about 15 pounds of explosives underneath them, and all I know is I got hit with
00:29:54.64 --> 00:30:00.64 something, and it feels like you get hit by a truck wall, a bunch of guys in the truck are shooting
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:07.12 you with a shotgun, that's sort of what it feels like, and, you know, my immediate reaction was
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:13.36 feel my legs, right, so I, I feel my legs and everything's still there, you know, I know
00:30:13.36 --> 00:30:18.56 something is wrong. Distance from the IED, a couple feet, I mean it's so, I mean, because
00:30:18.56 --> 00:30:24.56 I would, I would, I'd lia, a few feet, what were you and me are probably, is about, you know, just
00:30:24.56 --> 00:30:31.44 across the table, and, you know, lots of pain, pain everywhere, but not my eyes, so I was completely
00:30:31.44 --> 00:30:36.96 blinded, but, you know, totally under the assumption that I just had dirt in my eyes, and,
00:30:36.96 --> 00:30:41.12 I remained under this assumption that there was really nothing wrong with my eyes for, frankly,
00:30:41.12 --> 00:30:47.36 for weeks to come, and we'll talk about that, but, you know, I was, I, I didn't lose consciousness,
00:30:47.36 --> 00:30:50.48 and knew what was happening, I could hear the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:53.84 everybody thinks that when somebody gets their legs blown off their screaming like the movies,
00:30:54.16 --> 00:30:58.64 it's just never the case, it's a very different, like, visceral sound of pain,
00:30:59.92 --> 00:31:04.16 and it's, and I've heard it many times now, because, you know, this, this happened to
00:31:04.16 --> 00:31:09.52 us a couple times, and, um, so I heard that, I knew, I knew that rockmon had been hit,
00:31:10.08 --> 00:31:15.92 because I could hear him, and, um, you know, one of our, one of my teammates tells a story where
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:22.88 he, he got hit with a, with a foot, and a building next door, I mean, and it was, and that's how they
00:31:22.88 --> 00:31:28.72 knew something had gone terribly wrong, and, uh, you know, the medics come to me, there's nothing
00:31:28.72 --> 00:31:33.52 they can do for me, they, they sort of just wrap up my eyes, they know something's wrong, I really
00:31:33.52 --> 00:31:37.92 don't, frankly, I just, I keep assuming there's just dirt in my eyes, and that'll be fine,
00:31:38.80 --> 00:31:43.12 and, uh, eventually, we get taken out of there, and I was able to get up and walk to the
00:31:43.12 --> 00:31:48.08 heel, because, you know, you know, let somebody carry it when they've got a firefight to finish,
00:31:48.08 --> 00:31:53.68 and we get on, and, uh, as soon as the medics on the helicopter see me, they, they put me out right
00:31:53.68 --> 00:32:00.48 away, and I don't wake up for days. So, when I do wake up, um, in Germany, they, they told me my
00:32:00.48 --> 00:32:05.52 ride-eye had been removed, and, uh, I'd probably never see again on my left eye, but there's a chance,
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:09.92 and again, kind of self-deception kicks in, I'm like, so you're saying there's a chance,
00:32:09.92 --> 00:32:16.16 we'll be fine. Just get the surgery done, get me on a plane to, to back to Maryland, the
00:32:16.16 --> 00:32:20.24 Walter Reed Ospo, where these surgeons are, and let's do this, and they're like, it's going to be a
00:32:20.24 --> 00:32:25.52 day or two, I argue, we argue, you know, that, that's how it goes for the next couple of days. I can't really
00:32:25.52 --> 00:32:31.20 move, I can't get up to use the bathroom, my body is completely swollen and, and, and, and,
00:32:31.20 --> 00:32:36.08 and shredded, really, I mean, there's no real permanent injuries to the rest of my body, but it's,
00:32:36.08 --> 00:32:42.16 it's in such a state that, like, I just just shockwave from the blast. I think shock, and I was,
00:32:42.16 --> 00:32:47.92 I had a ton of shrapnel just throughout. I think I was swollen, um, might have been muscle
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:51.92 atrophy from being, you know, medically induced coma for so long, because I've been there,
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:58.88 been that way for five or six days, but really couldn't move, um, and just wrapped up really tight,
00:32:58.88 --> 00:33:04.48 because I mean, as you can see the scarring a little bit, um, I was just, it was kind of been
00:33:04.48 --> 00:33:10.80 through a meat grinder a little bit, and, um, I was also, I was hallucinating wildly, so,
00:33:10.80 --> 00:33:16.80 I, everything I saw was Afghanistan. I was lucid, I understood what was around me, but all I could
00:33:16.80 --> 00:33:22.32 see was an Afghan guy sitting next to me, or an Afghan village. It was, it's, it's almost like
00:33:22.32 --> 00:33:26.88 Phantom Pain, but with your eyes, and there's a medical term for it that I can't remember,
00:33:26.88 --> 00:33:35.28 um, but it was, it just an odd and terrifying experience, because it wasn't, I knew it wasn't
00:33:35.28 --> 00:33:42.88 real, but it's just everything I saw. And, um, eventually got back to Maryland, um, on a,
00:33:42.88 --> 00:33:48.48 on one of our medical flights, and, you know, my wife was there waiting for me, and, you know,
00:33:48.48 --> 00:33:51.84 we began how that conversation about, okay, what's the next surgery? Because I had to remove the
00:33:51.84 --> 00:33:55.44 cataract. I mean, that was, that was the issue. There was a lot of shrapnel in my left eye,
00:33:55.44 --> 00:34:01.44 the eye that was still there, and, you know, the issue was, could we, can we safely remove the
00:34:01.44 --> 00:34:05.28 cataract, and will he ever see again? And if you do, if we do do that, what's, what are his
00:34:05.28 --> 00:34:13.60 chances really, of having decent vision? And, um, you know, we, we prayed, and we, I, and I look back
00:34:13.60 --> 00:34:18.64 on it, and, and again, that, you know, we call itself deception, but it was really the strength to
00:34:18.64 --> 00:34:24.32 stay sane, and, and, and believe that I was actually going to see again, and, and I truly
00:34:24.32 --> 00:34:29.20 believe that was God's strength is working through me, it was allowing me to, to believe in
00:34:29.20 --> 00:34:33.84 something impossible, um, because otherwise I would have gone nuts, because people sometimes ask me,
00:34:33.84 --> 00:34:39.44 what's it like not knowing if you're ever going to see again? And I always answer, I, I don't know.
00:34:39.44 --> 00:34:43.92 I don't know what that's like, because it was never, that was never my mental state. My mental
00:34:43.92 --> 00:34:48.000 state was always, it'll happen, it's just a matter of time, and then I can finally get back to my
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.76 mental state. You know, the issue for me was like, when are we going to do this? You guys told me six weeks, all right, let's
00:34:53.76 --> 00:35:00.40 schedule it. And, you know, it was insanity. Yeah, I mean, that's obviously when I hear this story,
00:35:00.40 --> 00:35:06.08 I think Orion Joe who's with me in reminding you, and he got shot in the face, and, you know,
00:35:06.08 --> 00:35:13.68 it was a similar situation where, you know, clearly his, his eye, one eye was gone, but his
00:35:13.68 --> 00:35:21.52 other eye appeared to be intact, and he could actually see after he got wounded, then he got put into a,
00:35:21.52 --> 00:35:28.24 you know, he could see what was happening and, and walked into the Kazovak vehicle, but,
00:35:29.12 --> 00:35:33.12 you know, they put him into a medically induced coma, and when he woke up, he couldn't see.
00:35:33.68 --> 00:35:39.20 And then it was the same type of thing that they were telling you, they were telling him,
00:35:39.20 --> 00:35:45.68 which is, look, there was some nerve damage, we're not sure, and his attitude was very similar
00:35:45.68 --> 00:35:51.68 of like, well, it'll be okay, and, you know, it'll come back, but, you know, what didn't take
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:59.68 very long before the doctors were like, no, it's, it's not coming back. And I forget the timeline,
00:35:59.68 --> 00:36:05.68 you know, I forget the timeline, because it's kind of a, kind of a blur together.
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:14.32 But, yeah, for him, it was, he had a great attitude, but, you know, at the end,
00:36:15.60 --> 00:36:22.000 didn't happen. And, you know, and that's a guy that was still like, and he also still wanted to come back
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.84 and get back with his platoon, and was telling me, you know, don't worry, I can smell the enemy,
00:36:27.84 --> 00:36:36.08 and I'll know where to shoot. Let me back, sir. So, yeah, the fact that you were able to recover is
00:36:36.08 --> 00:36:44.48 awesome, awesome, and, you know, it's, it shows, it should show people that, you know, even though
00:36:44.48 --> 00:36:51.20 you had a great attitude, the threat of, of never being able to see again was very, very real, very,
00:36:51.20 --> 00:36:56.16 very, very real. Oh, yeah, and it truly was, I mean, we had miracles occur in the operating room,
00:36:56.16 --> 00:37:02.64 multiple occasions, and doctors were just amazed that not only could I see again, but see well again.
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:08.16 It was, because they're in their minds, they're like, well, if we do this surgery and his retina
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:14.48 doesn't detach, like we think it might, he'll still have, you know, crappy vision, you know,
00:37:14.48 --> 00:37:19.28 because his corny is all destroyed. I mean, everything's a mess in this eye, and, you know, we'll
00:37:19.28 --> 00:37:23.36 get him some decent glasses so we can kind of live his life, but he's, he's pretty much permanently
00:37:23.36 --> 00:37:28.24 disabled, and I just didn't listen, I don't even remember these conversations, like I think I
00:37:28.24 --> 00:37:32.24 blocked him out, and, you know, it's, because the first surgery was, we've got to remove the
00:37:32.24 --> 00:37:37.36 cataract, okay, that went well, all right, we removed the cataract great, you know, and the next step
00:37:37.36 --> 00:37:41.20 is to put a lens in plants, in your eye, like, like anybody normally would, when they have
00:37:41.20 --> 00:37:46.16 cataract surgery, that's just the normal thing to do. We ended up never doing that, because it's
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:51.28 kind of like replacing a window pane on a normal eye, but if the frame of the window is completely
00:37:51.28 --> 00:37:55.04 destroyed, then you have to sew the window pane to curtains, and that's never a good policy.
00:37:55.68 --> 00:38:00.40 So, they eventually refuse to do that on me, even though I was demanding it constantly,
00:38:01.60 --> 00:38:04.16 but because I wanted to see again, I wanted to get back, and I don't want to have a big
00:38:04.16 --> 00:38:10.64 thick glasses, which is what I have to wear now, or this specialized contact, but then another
00:38:10.64 --> 00:38:16.88 problem occurred, which is a whole, in my retina, that was expanding. And again, it's kind of a normal,
00:38:16.88 --> 00:38:22.24 you know, if you're over 50, this might be a normal thing that occurs, and then you have a pretty
00:38:22.24 --> 00:38:26.16 routine surgery to get rid of it and to stop it, but for me, it was incredibly fragile,
00:38:27.20 --> 00:38:31.76 but we had to do it. So I went blind again for six weeks, recovering from this surgery, so
00:38:32.32 --> 00:38:37.84 and I was truly living in darkness for a long time. You know, and not always, I think God
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:44.48 wasn't hallucinating the entire time, that stopped after about week one, just or just after my major
00:38:44.48 --> 00:38:50.40 surgery, my first major surgery, but I won't blind again. And another miracle happened because
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:54.32 they truly thought I wasn't going to make it through that surgery either. So, after, when they,
00:38:54.32 --> 00:38:59.12 when you were blind again for six weeks, going into that, did they tell you, okay, you're going to
00:38:59.12 --> 00:39:03.84 be blind for a period of time, and take time for you? Yeah, just because of the recovery process,
00:39:03.84 --> 00:39:08.16 you, they put a gas bubble in your eye so that it puts pressure on the back of your retina,
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:13.52 and you have to be faced down for six weeks. It's just the weirdest. What the hell did you do for six
00:39:13.52 --> 00:39:18.64 weeks? Like, it's down. I bet. I got one of those massage chairs. Uh-huh. We're, you know,
00:39:18.64 --> 00:39:25.20 you plant your face down. I had audio books going all day long. It was great. Yeah, and by great,
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:33.20 I mean, not great at all. Yeah, by great, you mean awesome. Yeah, yeah, start sucks and
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:39.84 I'm sure you, you, you had to stay faced down all the time. Are you, um, and that six
00:39:39.84 --> 00:39:44.96 weeks goes by, and then they eventually remove the gas bubble and dissipates. Yeah, so there's
00:39:44.96 --> 00:39:48.88 eventually a point where you're like, okay, it's gone now. I can, I'm allowed, I'm allowed to look
00:39:48.88 --> 00:39:53.60 straight again. And then, and then it's just, you know, refitting your eye with the right eye
00:39:53.60 --> 00:39:57.36 wearing, you know, like, glasses and contacts, so I can actually get back to normal life and
00:39:57.92 --> 00:40:04.80 in frankly, that took years. Uh, it, you know, it's, eventually, I'll just, I'll skip to the end.
00:40:04.80 --> 00:40:11.28 About two and a half years in, I finally got, got a referred by the Navy to an outside clinic that
00:40:11.28 --> 00:40:17.44 does these, these amazing contacts, um, there's only one company in the world that does it. And I
00:40:17.44 --> 00:40:21.76 can see 2020 with it. Now, not up close, you know, my vision's complicated because I have a
00:40:21.76 --> 00:40:28.08 cataract, but, but I actually see 2020 vision at distance, which is, I mean, just not even close to
00:40:28.08 --> 00:40:33.76 what they thought was possible. So, um, and, and despite all that, I mean, I, before that two and a half
00:40:33.76 --> 00:40:37.68 year mark, I still had decent enough contacts to survive. I mean, they just weren't comfortable,
00:40:37.68 --> 00:40:42.24 they've kind of drove me crazy. And, um, you know, well, I cared about was getting back to the team.
00:40:42.24 --> 00:40:47.20 I was almost going back to Team 3. The, uh, the command wouldn't let that happen in the end.
00:40:47.20 --> 00:40:52.000 There's because I couldn't get the medical waiver to do it. So, I stayed at what was now
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.52 called Special Reconnaissance Team 1. Again, we do Intel support for the SEAL teams,
00:40:56.16 --> 00:41:02.24 and, uh, did the troop commander there. So, in charge of about 50 personnel, mix of seals,
00:41:02.24 --> 00:41:07.36 intelligence specialists, um, all sorts of, uh, really great people that, you know, as you know,
00:41:07.36 --> 00:41:13.36 support the teams and intelligence matters. And, the point to Bahrain, uh, worked with
00:41:13.36 --> 00:41:18.64 joint special operations task force out there, um, working, you know, all throughout the
00:41:18.64 --> 00:41:24.32 Persian Gulf, uh, working on classified programs there, working in Lebanon as well, and, uh,
00:41:24.32 --> 00:41:31.04 coming back from that, uh, told I had to eventually get out. I mean, I had to start the medical
00:41:31.04 --> 00:41:37.68 retirement process. But before, before I did, I, I truly, I wanted to serve again. I mean, it was,
00:41:37.68 --> 00:41:42.64 it was extremely important to me. So, this deployment to Bahrain was about 2014. By the time I was
00:41:42.64 --> 00:41:48.48 really told, I had to medically retire. It was around 2016. But, you know, this process takes up to a year.
00:41:48.88 --> 00:41:53.44 And I asked that I, you know, be able to serve again in some capacity. Let my, let my, the specialties
00:41:53.44 --> 00:42:01.04 that I'd, that I'd acquired over the years at SRT1, be put to use in the Pacific, so they'd
00:42:01.04 --> 00:42:06.24 deploy me to Korea for my last deployment at the end of 2016. And as soon as I got home from that,
00:42:06.24 --> 00:42:10.96 I was, I was medically retired and, uh, had to find my next mission. You know, like you, you talked
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:17.12 about the, the earlier on of the podcast. I mean, it's, it life truly is about mission. And,
00:42:17.12 --> 00:42:22.32 you know, I'm getting to politics now running for Congress and in Houston, Texas for the
00:42:22.32 --> 00:42:29.04 second district. And I, I talk about this a lot and from a, from a political philosophy standpoint,
00:42:29.04 --> 00:42:34.32 if you don't give people a mission or you don't encourage people to find their purpose and their
00:42:34.32 --> 00:42:41.20 dignity, you, you have a failing society. Uh, it's so important. And you're not, you know, even,
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:47.28 even think tanks talk about this like American enterprise institute. Like our policies need to promote
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:51.36 a sense of mission for people. And help people understand that they have value in this world. They're
00:42:51.36 --> 00:42:56.96 here on this earth for a reason. And if you're not constantly seeking out what that value is that you
00:42:56.96 --> 00:43:02.08 contribute to society, you're not doing your job. And we need to help you do your job if, if, if, if
00:43:02.08 --> 00:43:06.88 need be, but you, but you do have value and you, and you, and you must find that purpose in life.
00:43:07.44 --> 00:43:14.000 Um, and, and guys like us, I think can't survive without that constant mission. And, uh,
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.32 well, we see it all the time with, with all vets when they, and I, I talk about this all the time.
00:43:18.32 --> 00:43:23.04 The vets that get out that have a note, a new, another mission. They focus on that mission. And they
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:28.48 go kick ass. The vets that get out and don't know what they're going to do that flounder around
00:43:28.48 --> 00:43:33.28 without a direction. Those are the guys that end up in trouble because they don't have a mission.
00:43:33.28 --> 00:43:38.48 So they go and drink a beer, then they have another beer. And then the, they could get prescribed
00:43:38.48 --> 00:43:43.28 pain medicine for their back, which hurts, which sucks. And, and they go down this bad road.
00:43:43.28 --> 00:43:50.24 And I believe a lot of it is because, you know, they just need that next mission. But you got done with,
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:56.48 so 2016, you didn't roll right into politics. You rolled to, you went back to college.
00:43:56.48 --> 00:44:01.84 Right. So no, in such an politics. And that become 2016. Did that become, you, you looked at
00:44:01.84 --> 00:44:06.40 what you're going to do next and you said, okay, well, how else can I serve, how else can I move forward?
00:44:06.40 --> 00:44:09.20 What's my next mission going to be in you decide you're going to go back to school?
00:44:09.20 --> 00:44:14.24 Back to school for, I knew it was going to stay in public service. So I knew my next mission was
00:44:14.24 --> 00:44:19.28 going to still be government. I wasn't exactly sure what. I knew I wanted to do, I wanted to
00:44:19.28 --> 00:44:25.36 be able to implement policy, strategy, and take that tactical experience. Because I had, you know,
00:44:25.36 --> 00:44:30.24 because I built an understanding of what policy and D.C. looks like on the ground.
00:44:31.52 --> 00:44:37.36 And actually because the reason I was hurt that day in 2012 was because of an Obama
00:44:37.36 --> 00:44:44.32 administration's policy of always wanting boots on the ground, battle of damage assessments for
00:44:44.32 --> 00:44:49.28 any, any close air support. So because earlier in that day, Marines had called in close air
00:44:49.28 --> 00:44:53.76 support on a compound that were taking fire from. For some reason, they wanted guys to walk
00:44:53.76 --> 00:44:58.40 across mine fields and go take pictures of it. Right. That's not good policy. Now, it's not a
00:44:58.40 --> 00:45:02.72 victimhood story. Don't get me wrong. I mean, there was a battle going on. We wanted to go. I don't
00:45:02.72 --> 00:45:08.80 care really what the reason is. But from a policy perspective, that's that's concerning. That,
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:14.24 that kind of pressure is being put on our two star and our, and that's what drove that mission.
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:18.16 That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So it's great to see somebody like General Madison
00:45:18.16 --> 00:45:22.48 right now who says the opposite. Well, I will not waste my troops time with these kind of things.
00:45:22.48 --> 00:45:27.12 And he's on record. You know, after we drop the mother of all bombs while back. So on record
00:45:27.12 --> 00:45:30.80 saying, I will not waste my troops time going to count the dead bodies out there. That's just
00:45:30.80 --> 00:45:40.000 good policy. So, you know, I wanted to take that experience to Washington. The National
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.40 Next Step is get the right education. So the Harvard Kennedy School, government is where I
00:45:44.40 --> 00:45:48.88 went. Got a master's degree in public administration. Focus in more on national security issues,
00:45:48.88 --> 00:45:55.20 economic issues, and a little bit of political US politics. How long was that school?
00:45:55.20 --> 00:46:01.04 I just did a year when you're a program. And, you know, it was kind of the accelerated executive
00:46:01.04 --> 00:46:05.60 style program that you can apply to. If you're, if you're older and you actually have some,
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:10.80 some life experience. What's the intensity level with that? Uh, it is tenses you make it. I took,
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:17.36 I took about four extra credits more than I needed to. So I was busy. Because I, you know,
00:46:17.36 --> 00:46:20.80 it's, it's not like going to college where you're just getting through it. I think, uh,
00:46:20.80 --> 00:46:24.56 I would highly recommend anybody. You know, you do a master's degree later on in life. You're
00:46:24.56 --> 00:46:28.16 really going to get the most you can out of it. Because you care about learning you're there for a
00:46:28.16 --> 00:46:33.36 reason because you have purpose. And, and you know, why you're there. So I got a lot out of it,
00:46:33.36 --> 00:46:37.04 honestly. And it was, it was quite, it was really an amazing year. I mean, you hear from the greatest
00:46:37.04 --> 00:46:43.28 people. I, you know, Bush's Deputy National Security Advisor teaching us. Um, I had, uh,
00:46:43.28 --> 00:46:48.48 you know, the, the premier experts on counter proliferation policy, uh, teaching us in class. I had
00:46:48.48 --> 00:46:54.16 Reagan's chief economic advisor as my economics professor. I mean, you just can't, you know,
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:58.32 these people don't speak in terms of like, this is what we think happens in the White House.
00:46:58.32 --> 00:47:02.000 Or no, they're like, when I was in the White House, this is how it got done. I mean, that's the kind of
00:47:02.72 --> 00:47:08.08 the level of instruction that you're getting. So I was really happy to, to, to get that education.
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:14.24 And it, it, it's truly applies to it's as, in the, in my current role is as running for office.
00:47:14.24 --> 00:47:18.88 Um, I'm glad it was there. But what I hadn't necessarily thought about running for office,
00:47:18.88 --> 00:47:23.12 even after I graduated, uh, I was looking at more policy jobs, you know, because I didn't,
00:47:23.12 --> 00:47:26.48 I don't have the political connections. I don't have the background and money and the donor
00:47:26.48 --> 00:47:32.64 networks to really, to, to jump off on a campaign, uh, right away. We thought about it in the long-term
00:47:32.64 --> 00:47:38.24 sense, for sure, but, uh, but not in the short term. And, uh, I was working with Pete Sessions,
00:47:38.24 --> 00:47:41.60 Congressman Pete Sessions, and Capitol Hill for a while, getting legislative experience there.
00:47:41.60 --> 00:47:50.48 And, um, working doing some consulting, uh, and, uh, eventually came to a head where I was about
00:47:50.48 --> 00:47:54.08 taking a job, either doing counter-opens, a master's instruction policy for the Department of Defense,
00:47:54.88 --> 00:47:59.12 or go run for office because my Congressman Ted Poe had just announced retirement.
00:47:59.92 --> 00:48:06.88 And we prayed about it. We thought about it. We, uh, had the right backing from, you know, some
00:48:06.88 --> 00:48:12.40 well-connected people that I think God just put in front of us at the right time, and my wife and I
00:48:12.40 --> 00:48:18.16 went for it. You know, she was, uh, she was all in, who was all in, and, uh, and that was it. I mean,
00:48:18.16 --> 00:48:22.80 I've already, I've already, I've already come back to Texas by this point to the health with Hurricane
00:48:22.80 --> 00:48:27.84 Harvey reconstruction. It was out volunteer and we're, my whole hometown of Katie. My parents didn't
00:48:27.84 --> 00:48:31.84 flood. They were, they were, they've been living in spring, which is just North of Katie,
00:48:31.84 --> 00:48:37.68 from past 13, 14 years, but, you know, neighbors needed help. Neighbors still need help. Um, it's,
00:48:37.68 --> 00:48:43.76 it's still pretty devastated in Houston. And, you know, that, I think the decision became easy,
00:48:43.76 --> 00:48:47.84 that we knew this was the right choice. Like, this was the right mission. If I cared about
00:48:47.84 --> 00:48:51.28 nuclear proliferation policy, what better place to affect it from Congress,
00:48:51.28 --> 00:48:56.56 to care about helping flood victims, no better place than elected office. Um, if you care about
00:48:56.56 --> 00:49:00.80 border security, you know, which Texans do, no better place than public office. You know, if we
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:06.000 care about protecting Americans and protecting the, you know, the, the sanctity of the seal teams and
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.36 and pushing the right policies from the defense level, then, you know, elected politics is
00:49:11.36 --> 00:49:17.12 where do I can do it from? And, and so the decision was easy. It was, there's the right choice for us.
00:49:17.12 --> 00:49:21.04 We knew we were doing it for the right reasons. We know we are still doing it for the right reasons.
00:49:21.04 --> 00:49:29.28 And we're not going to quit. So with all those things that you said that are real positive about
00:49:30.80 --> 00:49:38.08 having a political career, you must have also been looking at the, the nightmare, gut check, just
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:43.36 mud slinging that you're going to have to go, or that's going to be thrown at you and all that.
00:49:43.36 --> 00:49:48.64 And, and your family getting, the microscope on them and watched all the time and no privacy and
00:49:48.64 --> 00:49:53.28 all that, how did you weigh those things out? And did you think about those things as well?
00:49:53.28 --> 00:50:00.000 Absolutely. Uh, and it's, it's, by far the most concerning thing about politics. I mean, if anything
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.08 drives, drives you out, it's, it's that, you know, and frankly, the experience has been too bad.
00:50:06.08 --> 00:50:11.60 Yeah, I mean, I get a tack for silly things here and there. I've got a, you know, one of, one of
00:50:11.60 --> 00:50:18.56 my opponents, what, what I would call one of his cronies, there's, there's, there's these corrupt, um,
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:25.12 they call them the Slates in Harris County, which is Harris County is Houston. Um, and these
00:50:25.12 --> 00:50:31.44 three Slates are essentially three political maelors that go out and they, they, they target senior
00:50:31.44 --> 00:50:38.32 citizens especially. And they make it sound like there's these, these, these conservative review type of
00:50:38.32 --> 00:50:42.80 magazines, you know, these, something with authority behind it, but really they're not. Really
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:47.68 they're paid a play and it's just one author and they pick who they like based on what kind of money
00:50:47.68 --> 00:50:51.76 they were able to get out of the deal and then they trash everybody else. So, you know, they put
00:50:51.76 --> 00:50:55.84 mine it, they put my bio on there, it doesn't say anything about who I actually am, it just says,
00:50:55.84 --> 00:51:00.56 I'm homeless and don't have a job and we're like to be, I mean, it's, it's absurd, right? And
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:05.60 most people read it and they think this, this, this can't be serious. So, and actually got me a lot of
00:51:05.60 --> 00:51:10.24 votes because people would look me up after that and say, oh, well, this is, this is who this guy is.
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:14.40 Maybe I will vote for him after all. But, but unfortunately that's politics and that's, that's
00:51:14.40 --> 00:51:19.60 the world we live in. Even though the, you know, the Harris County Republican Party has publicly
00:51:19.60 --> 00:51:24.32 denounced these so-called Slates because they send out these voter guides and, you know,
00:51:24.32 --> 00:51:28.08 they've denounced them but people don't always know. People aren't, you know, sometimes a lot of
00:51:28.08 --> 00:51:32.48 a folks still rely on those. So, that you're battling this kind of corruption, you're battling this
00:51:32.48 --> 00:51:36.72 establishment. I mean, you know, we always talk about the establishment in politics and I never
00:51:36.72 --> 00:51:40.56 really knew what that meant. I think until I saw behind the curtain and now I truly understand.
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:47.12 And it's this class of politically connected people and the, and the donor class that really
00:51:47.12 --> 00:51:51.92 just stick together. And it's nothing to do with policy or doing the right thing for the American
00:51:51.92 --> 00:51:55.76 people. It's just how much money do you have? That's all that matters. And it's not, it's not all
00:51:55.76 --> 00:52:01.84 that matters. We made it into the runoff after last week's election, which was March 6. I was nine
00:52:01.84 --> 00:52:09.92 candidates in my primary and on an election day, I came out far and away first place. We've beat out
00:52:10.64 --> 00:52:16.96 overall in the election. I was second place but we beat out. So, just to again explain that a little bit,
00:52:17.60 --> 00:52:22.24 for people that aren't paying attention to election, you are in the, in the fight, you're going
00:52:22.24 --> 00:52:27.28 to get some nine other candidates going into the election. Obviously, there's some people that vote
00:52:27.28 --> 00:52:35.36 early through mail voting and they just vote early and you were behind there. But then as your
00:52:35.36 --> 00:52:40.64 campaign picked up and people started to actually see who you are when people came to vote on election
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:46.48 day, you, you won election day, but you didn't win all the votes combined because of people that
00:52:46.48 --> 00:52:52.32 had voted early and got it correct. But it shows the trajectory and the momentum of what you're doing.
00:52:52.32 --> 00:52:57.52 We've got some great momentum that we're excited about and indeed even put in paint a broader
00:52:57.52 --> 00:53:03.20 picture. We started this late November and the election was March 6. That's a very little time
00:53:03.20 --> 00:53:08.24 for anybody to get a campaign together. So, and we're going up against one of my opponents,
00:53:08.24 --> 00:53:13.68 that's probably all of ended up spending when the numbers come in between $6 and $7 million,
00:53:13.68 --> 00:53:20.40 which is a record for self-funding for a campaign like this. Another opponent, similar, very high
00:53:20.40 --> 00:53:24.80 spending, very much self-funded and it was already a state representative, so had some kind of
00:53:24.80 --> 00:53:30.48 campaign machine in place. You're trying to catch up. You're trying to build a campaign team
00:53:30.48 --> 00:53:36.96 and a message within almost no time at all and no money whatsoever. That's not an easy task.
00:53:37.76 --> 00:53:41.20 Only a couple months. Usually you start like a year out if you're going to run for Congress.
00:53:42.24 --> 00:53:47.60 But that just wasn't the case here because Ted Poe announced retirement about mid-November.
00:53:47.60 --> 00:53:53.44 So, we had a lot to overcome. We built that momentum quickly. We worked hard.
00:53:53.44 --> 00:53:58.32 We worked hard. We got the message out. It's meant as many people as we could and you know, it worked.
00:53:59.04 --> 00:54:04.80 We snuck by, it was not got to that third-place spot because as you said, so we were behind
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:10.08 during early voting and mail-in voting because that stuff happened so early. There was just no way
00:54:10.08 --> 00:54:15.44 from my momentum to catch up in time. But by election day, we were far and away first place and
00:54:15.44 --> 00:54:20.80 were able to sneak into the runoff. So, now we're in the runoff and that's May 22nd. So we got another
00:54:21.28 --> 00:54:27.28 two months to really prepare and get our message out there and I think we're excited about it.
00:54:27.28 --> 00:54:32.80 I think it's going to go well. So you talked about this a little bit. You talked about money.
00:54:34.16 --> 00:54:41.20 Money. And as disturbing as it is, what's driving so much of who wins these elections
00:54:41.20 --> 00:54:44.40 is who has the most money? Because that's how you get the advertising. That's how you get the
00:54:44.40 --> 00:54:48.56 mailers. That's how you get the word out there. I mean, if you don't have the money to pay for
00:54:48.56 --> 00:54:53.84 advertising, then no one knows who you're, and you don't get any votes. So as disturbing as that is,
00:54:53.84 --> 00:55:00.72 without money, you have a real hard time. I mean, you've done an amazing job with the
00:55:00.72 --> 00:55:04.96 limited amount. I mean, how much money did you go into that last election? We spending.
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:12.24 Ended up spending total about $200,000. So we were outspent in a 30 over 30 into one.
00:55:12.24 --> 00:55:17.04 Easily. And I would say more if you count what everybody else, you know,
00:55:17.04 --> 00:55:22.32 the first and second place also spent against me. I mean, you know, it's something to be proud of.
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:29.36 So I think we can win. It is $200,000 and you win up against somebody that spent $6 million.
00:55:30.40 --> 00:55:37.52 And yeah, like I said, unfortunately, money drives so much of these elections. And that's why you end up with
00:55:37.52 --> 00:55:44.56 those people that, I mean, I know you can't well, technically or possibly, but you're not supposed
00:55:44.56 --> 00:55:50.16 to be able to buy an election, right? Right. But I mean, the first thing that you talk about that
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:55.28 spent $6 million without that money, I mean, where would it be? It was a female, right?
00:55:55.28 --> 00:55:58.56 Where would she have been without spending that money? I mean, I'm assuming she wouldn't have been
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:03.92 anywhere. No. So she was able to buy herself at least third place. Right. And maybe if she had
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:08.56 another more money, she would have been able to buy herself first place. That's a scary thought.
00:56:08.56 --> 00:56:14.32 It is. I mean, you know, I don't like the way campaign finance works. I don't think you should
00:56:14.32 --> 00:56:19.52 be able to sell fund that much for a race. And you know, I understand that there's some good
00:56:19.52 --> 00:56:23.76 arguments to make that you can sell fund, you know, over what the individual limit is.
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:30.96 But to that extent, I mean, it's, you know, it truly creates a donor class of politicians.
00:56:30.96 --> 00:56:36.40 And like that's just, I don't think that's what we want as American people. And it's up, but it's
00:56:36.40 --> 00:56:40.96 up to voters in the end to decide. It's up to voters to see through that. And, you know, I always
00:56:40.96 --> 00:56:44.88 encourage, just go out and do your research. You know, just do enough to go on the websites of each
00:56:44.88 --> 00:56:49.44 candidate and get a filter where they are watched them. Watch their videos. See how they speak. See how
00:56:49.44 --> 00:56:54.48 they would represent you. See how they would articulate your values. You know, we put up YouTube
00:56:54.48 --> 00:57:00.88 videos all the time. You can always watch me in interviews. You know, we're coming or listen to podcasts,
00:57:00.88 --> 00:57:06.72 listen to Jocca's podcast. And, you know, because you want people to get to know you and you need
00:57:06.72 --> 00:57:11.36 to be out there with folks. You need to be meeting people everywhere you go. And that's how we want,
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:16.32 you know, that's how we built that connection with the voter. That's how we built momentum,
00:57:16.32 --> 00:57:21.28 just getting out and meeting people and inspiring them and connecting with them. That's, that's,
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:26.000 that's still works. And we proved that. That's one of the things that you did while your opponents
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.24 were spending a bunch of money. You put on your running shoes. Yeah. And ran through your entire district.
00:57:32.24 --> 00:57:37.76 Right. I did, uh, limp a lot of the way, too, because, uh, we talked about over preparing. Well,
00:57:37.76 --> 00:57:42.08 sometimes you can under prepare. And, uh, when you're running a campaign, there's not a lot of
00:57:42.08 --> 00:57:47.60 time to get your running in. And so I started that 100 mile run and, um, it was going well.
00:57:47.60 --> 00:57:51.76 You know, so I want to back up a little bit. We, we playing this a while out. It was going to be five
00:57:51.76 --> 00:57:56.000 days. We're going to cross the whole district. Really show that dedication. I want to, I want to,
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.72 get on the ground. I want to show the dedication to every inch of this district. And, um, with,
00:58:00.72 --> 00:58:04.56 with whatever publicity we get out of it, we're going to use it for good cause. And we, we set up a
00:58:04.56 --> 00:58:09.44 gofundme account. It's still active if you want to donate to it. Let's gofundme.com slash rebuild
00:58:09.44 --> 00:58:15.60 Houston with Dan Crenshaw. And that money goes to three particular volunteer groups that I was
00:58:15.60 --> 00:58:20.16 able to identify and vet that are still out there every day rebuilding people's homes. Because
00:58:20.16 --> 00:58:23.84 that, I mean, that is still going on. I always try to let everybody know if you're a contractor.
00:58:23.84 --> 00:58:28.80 If you've got any expertise, please come volunteer in Houston. We are backed up into, you know,
00:58:28.80 --> 00:58:33.28 it is, it is tough to find a contractor these days. Even if people have the money to pay for it,
00:58:33.28 --> 00:58:37.60 they still can't get any availability. The demand is so high that the prices have gone way
00:58:37.60 --> 00:58:42.56 through the roof. We need more people there nationwide. So, you know, police come to Houston.
00:58:42.56 --> 00:58:47.12 There's a work for you and there's good work. There's a lot left to do when people need it.
00:58:47.12 --> 00:58:52.80 So, in these volunteer groups are out doing it, you know, for $57,000, between $57,000,
00:58:52.80 --> 00:58:56.56 they can rebuild a whole home because all their labor is free. It's volunteers. And they
00:58:56.56 --> 00:59:00.72 do a great job and they're working a lot of these neighborhoods where individuals just can't
00:59:00.72 --> 00:59:06.24 do with themselves. And it was, it was just great to see that. A lot of church affiliated groups
00:59:06.24 --> 00:59:11.20 always out there helping. And, you know, it makes you proud to be a tax and it makes you proud to be an
00:59:11.20 --> 00:59:16.64 American. So, we finished that run, you know, by day three, it was certainly limping through most of it.
00:59:17.68 --> 00:59:22.48 It changed out my shoes, day five, we're running pretty well again, but it was tough.
00:59:22.48 --> 00:59:27.04 And it was fun. It was great. It was a great experience. You see people honking at you,
00:59:27.04 --> 00:59:32.48 maybe because you're in their way, maybe because, maybe because they're supporting you. I don't know.
00:59:32.48 --> 00:59:39.04 But, I mean, it was just, it was pretty credible experience to see the supporters out there to see,
00:59:39.04 --> 00:59:45.52 just, you know, it was, it was great. We went, and that was, that was when early voting started.
00:59:45.52 --> 00:59:52.08 It was, we voted on day one of that run. And, and, and, and, and, you know, two weeks later on election
00:59:52.08 --> 00:59:56.64 day, we, we wrapped it up and it was, it was a good night. It was a, we're on pins and needles.
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:02.000 It was until 2 a.m. that we knew that we'd actually come into second place by 155 votes.
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:07.52 So, you think anybody says their vote doesn't count, doesn't matter. That's wrong.
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:13.12 It, it truly matters. I mean, every single vote matter, I can't think every volunteer enough.
01:00:13.12 --> 01:00:17.36 Can't think every supporter enough. Because a lot of people went out and they maybe got 10 votes
01:00:17.36 --> 01:00:21.60 here and there, maybe a hundred votes here and there. You know, individuals were able to do that
01:00:21.60 --> 01:00:25.92 and put us over the top because they believed in the message. They believed in our candidacy.
01:00:25.92 --> 01:00:30.48 And it was just, you know, it's humbling. And it's, it's almost, you feel a weight of
01:00:30.48 --> 01:00:34.48 responsibility when people put their trust in you like that as you should feel it because you
01:00:34.48 --> 01:00:39.52 don't want to disappoint them. You know, you can't let your supporters down and I truly
01:00:39.52 --> 01:00:43.84 feel that way about every vote. So what's, so what's next right now?
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:52.48 We're the runoff. The runoff. It's just me and Kevin Roberts. And just, you know, it's
01:00:52.48 --> 01:00:56.48 May 22nd early voting starts again a couple weeks before that and it's a lot of the same.
01:00:56.48 --> 01:01:02.000 You know, we, we stick to the basics. We professionalize our organization. We ask for more money.
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.72 Please donate a crenchoffacommer.com and we, and we, and we, so that's actually real though. Like
01:01:08.72 --> 01:01:14.72 you kind of, you kind of joke about it. And I know you're like, like, most good human beings,
01:01:14.72 --> 01:01:18.56 you feel uncomfortable saying, hey, give me some money. But the reality is,
01:01:19.52 --> 01:01:25.28 for you to take this to the next level that you need, you need money. And so when you say that
01:01:25.28 --> 01:01:29.52 kind of jokingly that the reality is, if you don't get that money, it's going to be really
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:34.24 hard to swing an upset. Right. And so, so that's what's the, what's the website?
01:01:34.24 --> 01:01:41.36 It's crenchoffacongerist.com. CR-E-N-S-H-A-W-F-O-R-Congerist.com. You can donate there. You can check out the
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:46.72 can you see there. You know, CR interviews, your YouTube videos, or commercials, my bio, everything.

01:01:51.76 --> 01:01:56.32 That's how we get a lot of our word out because, you know, it's cheap and it hits the right people.
01:01:56.32 --> 01:02:01.20 So, crenchoffacongerist.com. And you know, that money, we spend it wisely. It doesn't go to
01:02:01.20 --> 01:02:06.96 anything silly. It's, you know, we need it to send mail to voters, you know, to get our message out.
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:12.24 We need to put out radio ads. We need it to buy t-shirts for volunteers and to buy yard signs so that
01:02:12.24 --> 01:02:17.12 people can put them in their yards and create that upwelling of support where everybody's got
01:02:17.12 --> 01:02:23.84 a damn crenchoff sign. You know, that's how we do it. And it's, but it's, we work our butts off.
01:02:23.84 --> 01:02:29.60 I promise you that we work for, we work for every vote out there. And I actually believe that's how
01:02:29.60 --> 01:02:36.88 it should be. And that's how it would be in Congress. Yeah. That's awesome. And I know you're on a kind of
01:02:37.52 --> 01:02:42.08 a time schedule today. And I know you got some other things that you want to do here while you're
01:02:42.08 --> 01:02:49.84 out here in sunny, sunny, San Diego, which isn't too sunny today. But I think we just hit everything
01:02:49.84 --> 01:02:58.96 of how people can best support your cause. And obviously, I'm in crenchoffer Congress on Twitter,
01:02:58.96 --> 01:03:08.64 your Dan Krenchau, Texas TX, correct. So at Dan Krenchau TX, and then on Facebook, it's pretty easy to
01:03:08.64 --> 01:03:13.20 find you. Uh, there's just Dan Krenchau. Dan Krenchau for Congress. Yeah.
01:03:13.20 --> 01:03:21.36 Pretty easy. Yeah. I just searched Dan Krenchau and you pop right up. So that's, uh, that's it. Well,
01:03:21.36 --> 01:03:26.96 you know, obviously, I just want to say before you take off, thanks for your service, thanks for
01:03:26.96 --> 01:03:34.000 your sacrifice for this great country. Thanks for what you've done for what you're doing. And thank

01:03:40.64 --> 01:03:46.88 the services and over, you know, we, we find our purpose. We find our new mission and this is it for
01:03:46.88 --> 01:03:52.32 me. You know, it's, it's helping Texans. It's given Texans a representative. I think they can be proud of.
01:03:52.32 --> 01:03:57.60 We're so often just disgruntled and ashamed of our politicians. And we don't really think they're
01:03:57.60 --> 01:04:04.000 working on our behalf because we don't always elect people who truly put service before self. And,
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.56 and, you know, part of this campaign is convincing those that we do have a future. And we do have
01:04:10.56 --> 01:04:17.20 a future of leaders that will attract people to conservative values and, um, and keep those values
01:04:17.20 --> 01:04:22.72 alive and, and, and again, give us a leader that we can be proud of. Awesome. Well, I think they'll
01:04:22.72 --> 01:04:29.52 definitely find that with you. Thanks for coming on and it's honored to be here. Until you come back

01:04:40.96 --> 01:04:52.000 on. Thank you. So Dan has left the studio, but he's also left some very good ways to support him
01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:03.60 and what he's doing. And echo Charles, speaking of support, yeah. Maybe you could tell the troops
01:05:03.60 --> 01:05:12.40 how they can support this cause. Sure. If they want, if they want. And while they're supporting
01:05:12.40 --> 01:05:17.60 this cause, also support themselves. Which is important. If they want, you know. Do you
01:05:17.60 --> 01:05:22.24 what I just said? Yeah, very important. I said important. Yeah, you said it correct. Yeah.
01:05:22.24 --> 01:05:27.36 Two T's and now on. Normally there's no T's in it for me. Yeah. Yeah. Important.
01:05:28.16 --> 01:05:31.84 Kind of like the British accent, sometimes they don't say the T's too, and sometimes the same
01:05:31.84 --> 01:05:39.36 really solid, you know. Like they say. This is not back to reality. They don't say the T.
01:05:39.36 --> 01:05:47.60 Reality or reality. And then the last back to support. Yeah, if you want to support.
01:05:47.60 --> 01:05:53.52 Support your joints. This is how you support your joints. If you're an already.
01:05:53.52 --> 01:05:58.16 Jocquoise supplements. Good supplements. Crill oil. Super crill. Jocquoise super
01:05:58.16 --> 01:06:06.96 crill oil and joint warfare. Some of them is for your joints maintain them. Also, discipline.
01:06:08.64 --> 01:06:12.96 Pre-workout. Pre-mission. Cognitive, enhancer plus physical.
01:06:15.36 --> 01:06:22.96 Enhancer. Force multiplier. For a small supply. Yeah, there's layers. Yeah, actually. Yeah.
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:28.80 You know, it's like a blend. It's a good blend. Yeah. I am running low on the crill oil. I did not take my
01:06:28.80 --> 01:06:35.28 own advice for the description. Subscription. Yeah. So it to manually get some more. But hey, man,
01:06:36.08 --> 01:06:40.40 that's life sometimes. If you want to get on the subscription thing,
01:06:41.84 --> 01:06:45.84 re up every what is it month. Right? Because it's a month supply. You can pay. Yeah, yeah,
01:06:45.84 --> 01:06:50.48 however much you take. And that's the smart way to do it. Totally is joint warfare too.
01:06:50.48 --> 01:06:55.76 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fully. It's the one. I think the combo is the best way to go for sure.
01:06:55.76 --> 01:07:01.68 Recommend the combo. Nonetheless, you get them at originmain.com. Good way to support and support
01:07:01.68 --> 01:07:06.16 yourself as a big one. Also, at originmain.com, there are guise and rash guards for you.
01:07:06.16 --> 01:07:13.60 Jiu Jitsu journey. If you have chosen or will choose to go on that Jiu Jitsu journey. There's
01:07:13.60 --> 01:07:18.16 no reason why not. You should go on the Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. And if you're going to ask what if I'm
01:07:18.16 --> 01:07:26.96 small, big, large overweight under the younger young, the answer is start Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. How
01:07:26.96 --> 01:07:33.04 do you get in shape for Jiu Jitsu? Yeah. That's what you do. Yeah. You know, Tim Tim always says like,
01:07:33.04 --> 01:07:37.68 oh, you know, he's been out of the Jiu Jitsu for a long time. Tim Ford. Yeah. And he'll be able to go.
01:07:37.68 --> 01:07:43.92 Okay. Yeah. I'm going to get back in shape. Take a, you're looking at the wrong lane. Yeah,
01:07:43.92 --> 01:07:47.52 you go back to Jiu Jitsu. Did you just get your inshate? Yeah. You'll be, you'll be fine.
01:07:47.52 --> 01:07:53.84 You're going to suffer a little bit. But might even suffer a lot. It's hard. You got to be hard
01:07:53.84 --> 01:07:59.60 mentally for a guy like Timbo because he's a purple belt. Yeah. And so he's going to come and
01:07:59.60 --> 01:08:03.60 get beat by some white belts. I mean, not white belts. Buy some blue belts. Yeah. So blue belts.
01:08:03.60 --> 01:08:07.36 Because you know, some blue belts, they bring it. Yeah. And they can keep bringing it.
01:08:07.36 --> 01:08:12.08 So she's bringing it. They've been in there. Yeah. Khabish. Yeah. Yes. So Tim would be like,
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:16.24 come back and then, and it adds that level of anxiety. Because you know, when you feel
01:08:16.24 --> 01:08:19.52 yourself, gal, well, you probably don't know this. But if you feel yourself gasating and you're
01:08:19.52 --> 01:08:22.64 like, you know, I was going to gas now, you're really gasating now that anxiety goes up and
01:08:22.64 --> 01:08:27.28 you get some more. That's how it is. He wants to avoid all that stuff. That's what I think. But,
01:08:27.28 --> 01:08:30.88 you know, that's when you put all these weird expectations and yourself, that's my opinion
01:08:30.88 --> 01:08:35.44 and the Jiu Jitsu. So just going to Jiu Jitsu and learn Jiu Jitsu and when you do, you're going to
01:08:35.44 --> 01:08:44.72 want a G. If you do G, because you can do no G as well. But when you choose a G, I recommend.
01:08:44.72 --> 01:08:50.24 You recommend. I think there's only one recommendation. I agree. In all seriousness, there's only one
01:08:50.24 --> 01:08:56.24 recommendation. Yeah. And I've been through a lot of G. I have a lot of G. Experience. Yeah. We'll say
01:08:56.24 --> 01:09:02.24 a significant amount of G experience. And the origin G has proven legitimately to be the best one
01:09:02.24 --> 01:09:08.08 kind of by far too. Yeah. There's just one that I used to use. It's to those good. It was fine.
01:09:08.08 --> 01:09:12.96 And it was like good. Yeah. There's a difference though. There's a difference between this G's
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:17.04 good. Yeah. I think you get an origin G. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know, it's funny. Like, you know,
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:20.64 how like when you get a new G in a Raskard or whatever. And you're kind of fired up with a
01:09:20.64 --> 01:09:23.68 little train because you got your new G. Yeah. I think you're kid with the new G. Yeah. You know,
01:09:23.68 --> 01:09:29.12 it's that. It's that faster. That feeling didn't wear off like for a while. Did you feel that
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:34.88 like when we rolled, when we were both wearing new origin G's? I did refired up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:09:34.88 --> 01:09:36.96 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I did you think maybe it was going to be the day.
01:09:36.96 --> 01:09:45.20 Oh, brother, I could I always think it's going to be the day always. Yeah. Dang.
01:09:45.84 --> 01:09:48.56 Because maybe one day they're willing to do it. I always think it's going to be the day, too.
01:09:48.56 --> 01:09:52.08 Maybe it's not up. Maybe it will. I don't know. Could be the day. Yeah.
01:09:53.12 --> 01:10:00.40 Anyway, origin main.com get your G there. When you choose to get a G, there's compression gear to
01:10:00.40 --> 01:10:04.48 Raskard. If you do no G, there's Raskard's there too. All made in America. Yeah. I was going to say
01:10:04.48 --> 01:10:09.60 all made in America. Yeah. Which is like it's no big deal. No, it's a huge deal. Yeah. It's a huge deal.
01:10:09.60 --> 01:10:16.08 Made in America in Maine in our factory by awesome workers. And it's not the kind where
01:10:16.08 --> 01:10:22.88 by crafts crafts people crafts crafts crafts crafts crafts person crafts people. People man there. Some of the
01:10:22.88 --> 01:10:27.84 more females. Yeah. But their craftsman. Yeah. Men doesn't mean your man. Yeah.
01:10:27.84 --> 01:10:36.08 Me, your human. Yeah. As far as I know. Like modern man like man kind. Yeah. Yeah. There you go.
01:10:36.08 --> 01:10:43.04 So craftsman kind craftsman kind. Nonetheless, all made in America. Yes. And that is a big deal.
01:10:43.04 --> 01:10:47.60 And it's not the kind where it's like, yeah. Let's import all their things or whatever. And then
01:10:47.60 --> 01:10:51.92 we'll quote unquote make it in America where you tick the one check box. It's like, yeah,
01:10:51.92 --> 01:10:58.16 technically it's made. It's not that kind. It's the kind where they grow the cotton in America.
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:03.52 What do they do after they grow the cotton? They harvest the cotton. They do. Well, they can die
01:11:03.52 --> 01:11:08.32 the cotton. And they weave the cotton. Yeah. There's all bunch of steps all done in America. Yeah.
01:11:08.96 --> 01:11:13.68 But the land of the cotton because it's not just cotton. It's an athletic. That's one of the
01:11:13.68 --> 01:11:20.88 problems with the old geese. They're all made just with with cotton. They're like crap. Yeah. And
01:11:20.88 --> 01:11:26.16 then why would you not get modern technology? Well, why? Because they don't have, they don't
01:11:26.16 --> 01:11:31.28 do you do you do to where they're making the geese? Yeah. Now. So like little issues that come up
01:11:31.28 --> 01:11:35.28 in you just just little or big ones or whatever one they come up in. I'll do it. I don't know.
01:11:35.28 --> 01:11:43.44 You put an origin ge in the dryer. It's dry like quick. Yeah. And because it's not all cotton.
01:11:43.44 --> 01:11:49.84 Yeah. Because if you remember it in the teams cotton kills. Sure. Cotton kills because it gets wet
01:11:49.84 --> 01:11:56.48 and then it's heavy and makes it cold. Yeah. It doesn't dry quick enough. Yeah. You get the blend going.
01:11:57.52 --> 01:12:00.96 Then you're good to go. There's all kinds of different leaves too, which is cool.

01:12:15.12 --> 01:12:21.36 do the immersion camp? It's not like a training camp for ADCC. No. It's an educational experience.
01:12:21.36 --> 01:12:29.84 Like you immerse yourself in that you can modulate to the level of your personal commitment
01:12:29.84 --> 01:12:37.36 to getting after it. Yes. So some people will be there and they're going to be really soar every day.

01:12:44.88 --> 01:12:50.16 from the education that they're going to have a learning new moves and techniques. Yeah. So that's
01:12:50.16 --> 01:12:56.000 cool about the immersion camp or some of us nothing is going to be sore because maybe it'll be
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.36 sore for a little while and then we're just going to cruise a little bit exercise to brain more
01:12:59.36 --> 01:13:03.20 and then the body is going to go back and do whatever you like. Yeah. And there's a lot to go around

01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:23.04 You know, it's like the first few days and then you can do this the second few days and then you can
01:13:23.04 --> 01:13:28.56 do all them if you want. So August 26 through September 2nd. We're going to be there.
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:34.24 You know who else is going? No big deal. Dave Burke. Yeah. Yeah. Dave Burke got the bug.
01:13:34.24 --> 01:13:39.12 Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He's got the bug. Yeah. He'll call me for just like verbal advice. Oh he's
01:13:39.12 --> 01:13:44.56 do you be texting me about about like guard passage? Yeah. Like position. Some like a really?
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.84 Hey, let's do it. Let's communicate about guard passing via text. Yeah. Amen. How do you
01:13:51.84 --> 01:13:58.80 catch the people with? Well, Americana. Yeah. And it's an interesting conversation because
01:13:58.80 --> 01:14:04.08 you know he says, oh well, the Americana's like what I use the most right now. And I told him
01:14:04.08 --> 01:14:10.32 like the Americana is actually not a really effective move. Right. Against any one that has trained
01:14:10.32 --> 01:14:15.12 for a little bit. Purple belt you're not going to you might catch an ablube belt in an Americana.
01:14:15.12 --> 01:14:19.28 Purple belt probably not going to happen. I did catch a black belt in Americana the other day.
01:14:20.32 --> 01:14:26.72 And it was like shame. Right. Like I got caught with the Americana. Yeah. And this this particular
01:14:26.72 --> 01:14:32.64 black belt was like shame. He hung his head and shame. He was like he got some Americana. Yeah. But
01:14:32.64 --> 01:14:39.84 I explained a Dave. The reason that the Americana is effective for him right now, the most effective
01:14:39.84 --> 01:14:44.80 I'm like is it the first submission that you learned? Yes, it is. So he's practiced at the
01:14:44.80 --> 01:14:49.60 most and he's figured out all the little nuanced things that you have to do right in order to make
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:56.16 the move of a move work and the Americana work. So he's figured out some of those things
01:14:56.16 --> 01:15:00.80 because he's tried it a bunch even when he missed it he learned something. He didn't even know
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:06.08 he learned something but he learned something. So he keeps trying and he got good with these.
01:15:06.08 --> 01:15:09.76 So he's good at the Americana. He's not going to get his people to know how to defend it yet,
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:15.68 which is going to be a problematic. So you got it. You got to that's what happens. But isn't that
01:15:15.68 --> 01:15:20.32 part of the whole learning process though? Because I think they I mean remember when I'm
01:15:20.32 --> 01:15:24.88 assuming you had similar experience where you were sure you do Americana and you get them and
01:15:24.88 --> 01:15:31.52 you did certain moves for years. Like like for when I first started my first good move was the
01:15:31.52 --> 01:15:38.000 Ezekiel. In fact, I used to call it the Ezekiel. The Ezekiel. That's what I thought it was.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.16 That was what I wanted to call it. But it was I learned it like one of the first submissions I
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:45.28 looked and then I just tried it all the time and I got pretty good at it. Then you realize that
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:47.92 it's not that hard to defend the Ezekiel. Eventually when you start going against better
01:15:47.92 --> 01:15:51.68 guys. So then you got to move to the I think the next move that I actually started doing a lot of
01:15:51.68 --> 01:15:55.44 was the camera and I spent a couple of years at that camera and then I spent a couple of years at
01:15:55.44 --> 01:15:59.04 Crucifix. Then I spent a couple of years at the straight foot lock. And then you know so
01:16:00.16 --> 01:16:04.88 and you know just get a little bit of those position. Yeah that's how. But gave Burke
01:16:05.52 --> 01:16:11.60 back to my point. He's coming. He's coming to the camp. Yeah. And you know what else is I will see
01:16:11.60 --> 01:16:17.20 else. We'll see if we'll see if we'll see if life. Yeah. I hope we all have to work. Sure.
01:16:17.20 --> 01:16:22.96 Yeah. I blocked this off though. Yeah. Just sweet. Yeah that's really good fun. Yeah cool.
01:16:22.96 --> 01:16:28.64 Go man. If you could make that make that. What's the date on them again? August 26 through
01:16:28.64 --> 01:16:32.08 September 2nd. Oh yeah and if you want it if you do want to come you can go to origin main.com
01:16:32.08 --> 01:16:36.48 and you go to the merchant camp and you can sign up. Yeah you can come and hang out. It's a good
01:16:36.48 --> 01:16:43.36 lobster if you like lobster. Yeah. Yeah. He likes steak. Yeah. Hang out and Maine. Visit our factory.
01:16:43.36 --> 01:16:49.04 Yeah. Which is awesome. I think you can go like paddling, stand up, stand up, stand up,
01:16:49.04 --> 01:16:56.000 paddle and unloading and stuff. Yeah. All kinds of stuff. Yeah. Also good way to support yourself.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.40 If you choose to vary up your work up. Make it a little less boring. You always make it sound like
01:17:02.40 --> 01:17:07.92 I do these boring workouts. Yeah. And I just realize I'm taking that abuse for quite some time.
01:17:07.92 --> 01:17:12.96 Oh. My workouts are not boring. Yeah. In a fact they're boring and and hard. So they're hard.
01:17:12.96 --> 01:17:18.88 Yeah. So here's the thing where what boring is like just a complete matter of opinion. You know,
01:17:19.76 --> 01:17:29.52 so to me if you're going to do 20 reps squats, brass, 20 reps, brass, 20 reps until you're like
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:38.32 that's kind of boring and have you ever done it before? Yes. You've done that one. Not your exact
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:44.64 one. But yeah, I did do 20 reps. Watch some in fact. Yeah. You've done 20 reps squats that you can only
01:17:44.64 --> 01:17:50.88 squat 10 times. Well, that's physically impossible. But no. Yes. It is if you can only do 10 times.
01:17:50.88 --> 01:17:54.48 You can only do 10 times. No. You can do 20 times. You can do 20 times. You can do 20 times. No.
01:17:54.48 --> 01:17:59.12 That's it. That's not how it works. No. All right. Right. Hey, look. Take my word for it. You can
01:17:59.12 --> 01:18:05.36 physically do it 10 times mentally do it 20 times. Okay. You do it. So you imagine you do 20 times. Okay.
01:18:05.36 --> 01:18:12.24 It's a look. You can physically do it 10 times. I guess technically you're right. And I want to
01:18:12.24 --> 01:18:17.04 listen. I don't want to split hairs, but you're still not right. If you can do it 10 times,
01:18:17.04 --> 01:18:20.48 but you can do it 20 times because look, if you can do something 20 times, you can do it 10 times.
01:18:20.48 --> 01:18:26.32 So yes. But what you're saying is something that you, you know, max out at 10 times. The
01:18:26.32 --> 01:18:30.32 weight you use to max out at 10 times. You do it 20 times physically impossible.
01:18:30.32 --> 01:18:37.52 10 times. 10 times. Well, apparently for echo. Oh, man. See. Anyway, back to the workout. Maybe that's
01:18:37.52 --> 01:18:50.40 where that skinny knee is gone. No, baby. No, baby. Anyway, if you want to very up the workout,
01:18:50.40 --> 01:18:56.64 go to on it.com slash jockel. Get some cool kettlebells. Yeah. Get some battle ropes. Get a
01:18:56.64 --> 01:19:01.60 maze. Get two maces. Have you won an alight on one boom? When you light them more interesting.
01:19:01.60 --> 01:19:06.96 I use them. So my workouts are interesting. All right. Well, there you go. Yeah,
01:19:06.96 --> 01:19:11.84 the interesting workout. Well, do it that way. That's what I would would what he said.
01:19:11.84 --> 01:19:18.000 Suggest. Okay. Anyway, go there. On it.com. Good stuff in there. Don't get addicted to the website
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.36 because there's a lot of good information too on there. Because you could. Unless also
01:19:23.36 --> 01:19:29.68 good way to support when you get the books that jockel sometimes reviews on this podcast. I
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:34.64 organized or we organized them on jockelbidcast.com. Click on the top. So the books from the
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:39.44 episode, I got all the books listed there, including little articles that, you know, how
01:19:39.44 --> 01:19:45.60 sometimes you'll cover article. All list those on there too. How much research would you have to
01:19:45.60 --> 01:19:52.000 do if you knew nothing about this podcast or me? How much research would you have to do to figure out
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:01.36 that we read books on the podcast and that they're all on jockelpodcast.com. The reason I
01:20:01.36 --> 01:20:08.56 ask this is because I've had people ask me on social media like a week ago, like on Twitter,
01:20:09.36 --> 01:20:16.80 do you like to read? Yeah. Right. Like that's a great. You don't have to dig very deep to
01:20:16.80 --> 01:20:25.60 know that answer. Yeah. Right. Do you like to read? Right. That this is a really low level
01:20:25.60 --> 01:20:30.88 question that doesn't take a whole lot of research to figure out. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I guess
01:20:31.12 --> 01:20:35.84 is that laziness or is it like, hey, this guy seems pretty accessible. I'm just going to ask him
01:20:35.84 --> 01:20:40.80 here he is. I wonder if he's got likes to read. I don't think the likelihood of it being laziness
01:20:40.80 --> 01:20:44.64 because obviously it's going to be different for different people but the likelihood of it being
01:20:44.64 --> 01:20:50.40 laziness is pretty low. I think I don't think it's laziness at all. I think it would be a mix
01:20:50.40 --> 01:20:56.80 or one of these things. Yeah. They just want to ask you a question that you know,
01:20:57.36 --> 01:21:02.96 that you're going to have an answer to or or maybe they're just new or maybe they know you
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:09.20 from extreme ownership and you know, I know you wrote this cool book. Hey, do you like to read in general?
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:15.12 Kind of maybe they're going to listen to your some big crush being too judgmental. Yeah. If you're
01:21:15.12 --> 01:21:22.08 jumping to that conclusion that it's laziness. Yeah. You like to read like we literally have a podcast
01:21:22.08 --> 01:21:28.80 about books that we read and and then people say, do you have a list of books? Do you
01:21:28.80 --> 01:21:35.04 have any books you recommend? Yeah. Do you have a book list? Do you have a reading list? These
01:21:35.04 --> 01:21:39.28 are all things I could ask on a regular basis. Is this kind of like the time I ask you, hey,
01:21:39.28 --> 01:21:44.64 do you know, an of any gun ranges? You said, yeah, Google going Google and search gunaries.
01:21:44.64 --> 01:21:50.08 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel the same tone. Here's the thing you never
01:21:50.08 --> 01:21:55.60 to really know a when people are coming in the game. You don't know what their deal is or where they're
01:21:55.60 --> 01:22:01.60 coming from. So yeah, like maybe or maybe maybe they just heard you on Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan
01:22:01.60 --> 01:22:05.60 and was like, boom, this guy's super interesting. Let me go straight to him and start talking
01:22:05.60 --> 01:22:10.80 on kind of thing or start asking questions rather than going on the internet. Let me research
01:22:10.80 --> 01:22:16.16 who this guy is and what he likes and doesn't like to do with such a test. Am I am I lazy
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:21.68 in the fact that when I want to know something, I'll Google it. No, that's not easy. Okay. I don't
01:22:21.68 --> 01:22:30.40 yeah, I don't think so. As opposed to what? I don't know saying going to school and studying
01:22:30.40 --> 01:22:37.44 it first. I guess it's not a good idea. You know, alternative nonetheless, if you are feeling
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:43.84 not lazy, actually this has nothing to do with laziness because this is more a convenience that
01:22:43.84 --> 01:22:48.16 I think would be beneficial or I thought would be beneficial for people who are looking for the
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:52.40 books that you cover and ways to get them. That's why I organized these books on talk about
01:22:52.40 --> 01:22:58.72 yes, I'll call the website. So yeah, they're all there by and by chance they're kind of in order
01:22:58.72 --> 01:23:03.36 of preference in order of the way you almost the way you should read them. Maybe I'd have to shift
01:23:03.36 --> 01:23:07.52 some of them now. Yeah. I should put them in a different order because there's some books that I
01:23:07.52 --> 01:23:11.36 read again. I was like man, I should be at this would be near the top. I mean about faces is number
01:23:11.36 --> 01:23:16.000 is number one. Right. You should read that book first. Yeah. People ask me that all the time.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.80 What's your favorite? I've already read extreme ownership. Is there another book you recommend?
01:23:20.80 --> 01:23:25.76 I read well and I've read all your books. What books did I read next about Facebook? I don't
01:23:25.76 --> 01:23:31.84 know, David Hacworth. Yeah. That's like you're right. No one. Yeah. So anyways. Yeah. Make sense. I mean,
01:23:31.84 --> 01:23:36.80 I organized them by episode. Yeah. And most recent episode. Right. With book. But if you go back to
01:23:36.80 --> 01:23:41.12 episode one, which there's no book, but two, there's a book. And if you go in that order of reading,
01:23:41.12 --> 01:23:46.08 that's a good progression to get people to book. Oh, okay. Okay. Properly. I assume. Gotcha. So if you
01:23:46.08 --> 01:23:51.44 if you if you want to read your book, Jockel's book list in order of importance. In order importance,
01:23:51.44 --> 01:23:57.36 you go in chronological order, pur pod. Yes. With books. That's recommended. Not all podcast
01:23:57.36 --> 01:24:01.76 of books. That's right. That's right. Cool. Well, there it is. Again, just click on the books and
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:08.000 boom, take a seat there, boom. Click through there, get your book. Easy way. Good way to support

01:24:51.60 --> 01:24:56.96 hey, leave a review. I'm not saying to leave a review, but I think sometimes people they want to
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:02.64 leave a review, but they don't like think about it. You know? Mm. And then one, let's say I get
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:06.32 reminded like, oh, shoot. I want to leave a review and I get reminded like, boom, then I'm going to

01:25:18.96 --> 01:25:24.56 If you read an awesome review, well, it doesn't have to be awesome, but if it's funny or it's good
01:25:24.56 --> 01:25:31.60 or it's creative. That's what I should have said. It's a creative review. There's been some really
01:25:31.60 --> 01:25:37.36 good ones. Everything with Amazon reviews for tea and books and there's a lot of people that get

01:26:26.24 --> 01:26:33.52 hands? I think it's called it hands. Exerp and hands extras, which means that echo has gone and put
01:26:33.52 --> 01:26:40.48 his cinematic flare. No. Oh, say, I put some music on it and I put some text on it. There it is.
01:26:40.48 --> 01:26:45.60 It's in the madhouse. It's in hands. A little bit of soft. It's in the madhouse. Yeah. All right. Well,
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:51.84 there it is. There's some of those on there. That video as well. By the way, no big deal. I, when I got to the gym
01:26:51.84 --> 01:27:04.48 today, Carl, he says, hey, I saw you on a world star. That's what you made it. We made it straight up.
01:27:04.48 --> 01:27:08.72 Yeah. Popular culture. Yeah. Popular culture. We're on a world star. World star.
01:27:10.64 --> 01:27:15.44 If you don't know what world star is, it originally was for fights. That's what I knew it for.
01:27:15.44 --> 01:27:20.000 Yeah. That's how I think that's how it gained. Yeah. I think you, it was for like, it was for
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.28 it was for like music videos. I think hip hop music videos and stuff like that. Then you get, you know,
01:27:25.28 --> 01:27:29.12 I used stuff. I would watch it because they because people would film street fights. I like to
01:27:29.12 --> 01:27:33.20 watch street fights. Sure. Learn a lot from street fights. And what's funny is it became such a
01:27:33.20 --> 01:27:37.04 popular culture thing that when people would be recording the fights that they're going to
01:27:37.04 --> 01:27:43.28 then put on world star, they would be saying world star during the fight. Someone be filming
01:27:43.28 --> 01:27:47.68 and saying, world star, this is going on world star. Well, now guess what's on world star. That
01:27:47.68 --> 01:27:54.80 goes video. We made it. Jockels on the way star. World star. Dang. That's good. Nonetheless,
01:27:55.68 --> 01:28:03.68 cross cultural boundaries. Yeah. Okay. World star. Well, star. Maybe it happened. You did 100%.
01:28:04.72 --> 01:28:09.28 Yeah. YouTube. You know, so. People who don't star. Thanks for putting me on there. Yeah. That was good.
01:28:09.28 --> 01:28:14.80 That is good. Awesome. So yeah. YouTube. Good one. Good way to support. Also,
01:28:14.80 --> 01:28:23.04 Jockels store. It's called Jockels store. Obviously. Jockels store.com. Obviously. That's where you can get
01:28:23.04 --> 01:28:28.32 shirts, t-shirts. Some travel mugs on there. Some rash guards. More rash guards. This is like
01:28:28.32 --> 01:28:33.76 Jockel gear rash guards. So compared to how would you compare them to the origin? Because actually
01:28:34.64 --> 01:28:38.56 they're made. They're similar. Yeah. They're similar. They're in Jockel. They're more like geared
01:28:38.56 --> 01:28:48.000 tour light toward like Jockel. Well, let's. Yeah. Let's say this. That from a, from a visual perspective,
01:28:48.88 --> 01:28:54.24 there's a way that Jockel gear looks and there's a way that origin gear looks. There's some areas
01:28:54.24 --> 01:29:01.76 that overlap. There's some areas that don't overlap. Some of the, let's call them color combinations
01:29:01.76 --> 01:29:06.88 that my brother Pete Roberts puts together. They wouldn't be allowed in the Jockel store. Yeah.
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:12.96 They wouldn't be Jockel gear. And there's some things that Jockel gear does that wouldn't be appropriate
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:20.72 for origin because origin is a little bit in the other direction. Sure. The overlapping areas are
01:29:20.72 --> 01:29:28.08 good. But if you want your gear made in America is one place to get it done right. That's our factory
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:34.24 up in Maine. True story. So yeah, bone making it rash guards there as well. Some patches.
01:29:34.24 --> 01:29:39.76 Those are restocked. A lot of people were hitting me up. That's why for patches. Yeah. It's weird that
01:29:39.76 --> 01:29:43.60 people have to hit you up that you just don't pay attention to the stock and say, wow, I love running low.
01:29:43.60 --> 01:29:48.96 I should be order more. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's not that important to you. No, no, no, it's important.
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:54.24 So I got to handle on it and I think I've a solid system where you know, we're going to run into
01:29:54.24 --> 01:29:57.68 way less of that. If any of that. Okay. That's good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:29:57.68 --> 01:30:01.44 Unless the women's stuff on there are some hats because it doesn't mean a lot to me. Yeah.
01:30:01.44 --> 01:30:05.84 Just I'm saying that's cool. So maybe I should be more. I should do a better job of
01:30:05.84 --> 01:30:10.000 expressing how important it is to me for people if they want patches to be able to get one.
01:30:10.64 --> 01:30:14.80 Yeah. Maybe I haven't. I obviously haven't done a good job. Yeah. It's your fault. It's your fault. It is.
01:30:16.72 --> 01:30:21.68 So yeah, Dracolster.com. That's a good good way to support. Also, psychological warfare. If you
01:30:21.68 --> 01:30:26.64 know what that is, that's an album. An album. Not a music album. It's a to
01:30:26.64 --> 01:30:35.84 soak and word spoken word with tracks, jockel tracks. And each track is designated, formulated,
01:30:35.84 --> 01:30:42.48 engineered. It's engineered is what it is to help you through little points of weakness that you
01:30:42.48 --> 01:30:50.000 might run into on your campaign against weakness. Like if you want to skip, I always say if you
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.000 want to skip the workout, if you're like, hey, I'm too tired. I don't feel like it. I don't feel like it.
01:30:56.56 --> 01:31:02.000 I start with Alan because that's essentially why this whole thing exists because that
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:08.64 that was the issue that was the genesis of this album. Yeah. Was echo questioning how
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000 he could overcome these moments a week. Or how I do and then I kind of answered one of them
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000 and he said, we do record those things. Yeah. You know what's funny is that I asked you that
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.24 before and it wasn't that specific question, but it was essentially that question and be like,
01:31:22.24 --> 01:31:27.76 hey, what do you do? And then you like he kind of gave me a look in more like as if your feelings
01:31:27.76 --> 01:31:31.92 don't matter kind of thing. You basically pull the jockel. No, it doesn't matter if I got a
01:31:31.92 --> 01:31:34.96 little bit of this kind of thing. I got to ask this somewhere, you know, someone said, hey,
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:38.40 can you tell us a little bit more about your morning routine? Like what you,
01:31:38.40 --> 01:31:41.20 like it's so you know, you can't. I know you got to barely, but can you tell us more about your
01:31:41.20 --> 01:31:48.32 morning routine? I was like, yeah, I listen. My morning routine is extremely, extremely important.
01:31:48.32 --> 01:31:54.08 So yours, yours, the steps of the jockel morning routine. First of all, you set your alarm clock.
01:31:54.08 --> 01:32:00.24 You set all your alarm clocks. You set the first one at 430. You set the next one at 435. You set
01:32:00.24 --> 01:32:05.92 the next one at 440 and you have your backups. By the way, you don't set your backups at the same
01:32:05.92 --> 01:32:09.92 time because you don't want to be fumbling around with three alarm clocks in the morning. It's good
01:32:09.92 --> 01:32:14.40 tip. I said, then you get done with that. Then when the alarm clock goes off, you get up. You get out
01:32:14.40 --> 01:32:19.84 of bed. Then you go and it's important that you get your toothbrush out. It's enough brush.
01:32:19.84 --> 01:32:28.88 And then I use 46 brush strokes on each side of my mouth. And no more no less. And then I spit
01:32:28.88 --> 01:32:33.76 three times into this piece of mouth. Oh my god. Here's the more routine dude. You get up and you go.
01:32:33.76 --> 01:32:39.84 Yeah. Yeah. Well, then again. No, I know. Right. You know. Yeah. I know. But it's like
01:32:39.84 --> 01:32:44.88 the reality is, is someone going to write down my morning routine. Then fall the exact same thing.
01:32:44.88 --> 01:32:48.96 And would that be good for him? Maybe. I don't know. Well, here's the morning routine then.
01:32:48.96 --> 01:32:56.48 Get up and go. Get up and get up. Yeah. But here's like some people they they focus on. And
01:32:56.48 --> 01:33:02.56 this can be beneficial from from what I hear. They focus on or they identify certain things they do
01:33:02.56 --> 01:33:06.48 in a morning routine that helps them that like set some up. No, I mean, you're whatever.
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:10.80 It's a very morning routine. And I actually wrote about in the in the field manual. It's like
01:33:10.80 --> 01:33:15.92 the morning routine starts the night before. Yeah. Yeah. The morning routine starts when you
01:33:15.92 --> 01:33:20.32 get your gear ready because you want to be fumbling around in the morning. Don't wait. Don't
01:33:20.32 --> 01:33:25.12 set yourself up to fumble around what things in the morning. Right. That's just a bad thing. Don't do that.
01:33:25.12 --> 01:33:31.12 So you you do have your gear ready. You know, for me, I'm very systematic in pretty much
01:33:31.12 --> 01:33:37.68 the way I'm saying. Yeah. And so you know, I have like all my workout gear is in the bathroom on
01:33:37.68 --> 01:33:42.56 hangers. You know, pair shorts shirt on each hanger. There's six of them. They're all the same.
01:33:42.56 --> 01:33:48.96 There's no thought process that's needed. They're all matching. And I have the same kind of socks,
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:55.04 all my socks are the same. I do have black socks and white socks, but one drawer is just completely
01:33:55.04 --> 01:34:00.48 white socks all the same. You grab those and put those on. Boom. You brush your teeth, boom.
01:34:00.48 --> 01:34:06.56 You take you. I take my supplements in the morning and at night, but I take my my cereal oil and my
01:34:06.56 --> 01:34:13.36 my joint warfare. Boom. And then I go hit it. How much water do you drink? It's it's I drink when I'm thirsty.
01:34:13.36 --> 01:34:18.48 I drink and then if I'm I don't measure it. So you don't be like, okay, no, mix. Yeah, I drink when I'm
01:34:18.48 --> 01:34:25.04 thirsty. You want to hungry. But if you drink water when you thirsty, you're already 2% dehydrated.
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:35.12 Okay. Well, I drink about 3% more than this. All right. There you go. So you 1% over hydrated or hydrated.
01:34:35.12 --> 01:34:40.16 Within. No, let's, but we'll, you know, like, I'll drink a whole thing like the, you know, the
01:34:40.16 --> 01:34:44.40 mugs that we have to travel that they're three ounces. By the way, I'll drink a whole thing at that.
01:34:44.40 --> 01:34:49.76 Just routine. That's kind of the routine. But was it like in the morning? Yeah. You like you pound it?
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:55.12 Sure. If you want to call it pound it. Why do you drink it? Because you want to stay hydrated.
01:34:55.12 --> 01:35:00.56 Yeah, but get the water back in there, man. Get, get it. It's good for you. Water is good for you.
01:35:00.56 --> 01:35:04.96 By the way. Yeah. No doubt better than sold out in the morning. You're trick a coke in the morning. No.
01:35:04.96 --> 01:35:10.16 Bro, it's like, hey, where's we did these monster masses in the back and the derbs.
01:35:11.36 --> 01:35:15.60 So my son was doing a monster bash with us when he was like six or six. Well, what's the, what's the
01:35:15.60 --> 01:35:19.44 monster masses like you? Oh, you do rope climbs that you do a sprint. Okay. I work out. When I'm
01:35:19.44 --> 01:35:24.16 the, you do pull ups and then you, and they put little things in there sometimes. So one of the
01:35:24.16 --> 01:35:30.64 things that they had to do was drink a coke through a straw. So you're like doing pull ups in a rope
01:35:30.64 --> 01:35:35.76 time and then you got a coke. You told me. Yeah. And so he, I think that was the first time you
01:35:35.76 --> 01:35:41.52 ever tried soda. Yeah. And he's like, yeah, he's nasty. It's, well, there's, if you're not
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:47.76 having a warning soda though. Yeah. But what, there's two elements to drinking a soda,
01:35:47.76 --> 01:35:51.60 especially for the first time is, okay, it tastes weird. Sweet sugary and carbonated. Yeah. The
01:35:51.60 --> 01:35:56.08 carbonated will burn your mind. It feels like it's burning them out. Yeah. So like it. Yeah. You can't do that.
01:35:56.08 --> 01:35:59.68 You can. That's not right in the middle of the workout, too. Yeah. Come through that. Well,
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:03.84 you keep in mind. You just described your morning routine. You answered the question that they
01:36:03.84 --> 01:36:07.60 were at. I know. I know. I don't think that's why I said, look, I'm not trying to be negative against
01:36:07.60 --> 01:36:15.04 morning routines. Yeah. And there's pretty much what I do. But the, the reason is I think people think,
01:36:15.04 --> 01:36:19.76 oh, if I have, if I knew you're morning routine, then I'd know what the secret is. Yeah. So like,
01:36:19.76 --> 01:36:24.40 hey, man, the secret is get up and go do something. That's secret. Yeah. I'm not going to,
01:36:24.40 --> 01:36:28.64 here's the deal. Here's the deal. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine. It's the solution.
01:36:28.64 --> 01:36:33.52 Your promise. Now, I will say that if you fumble around in the morning, it's going to cause
01:36:33.52 --> 01:36:37.52 you problems throughout the day. So don't fumble around the morning. Set your set your life up correctly.
01:36:37.52 --> 01:36:43.36 So that you're not fumbling around. That's good. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine as
01:36:43.36 --> 01:36:49.68 the solution to your problems. Yes. I'm not going to do that. But I will say that if you do have a good
01:36:50.64 --> 01:36:56.80 system that you go through in the morning, it will set up your day correctly. Yeah. That's why I think
01:36:56.80 --> 01:37:00.64 people ask what people want it. And I get it. Okay. I'm not trying to be like a jerk, right? I'm not
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:04.88 sure that negative. I got some kind of making fun of what you're making fun of. I'm making fun of
01:37:04.88 --> 01:37:09.36 morning routines a little bit. But at the same time, I have one and I stick to it. Yeah. But I think
01:37:09.36 --> 01:37:13.84 what I say is the thing. That's the thing. I don't actually have something and I stick to it. Like,
01:37:13.84 --> 01:37:18.72 I do this is what is I follow the functional thing that works in your stick to it. Yeah. And I
01:37:18.72 --> 01:37:25.04 stick to it. So that's that. But I do, I didn't like design my morning routine. I didn't see
01:37:25.04 --> 01:37:29.20 it. I'm going to design this program. No, it's like, I know what works. It's functional. And that's
01:37:29.20 --> 01:37:33.36 what I do. I do things that work. Yeah. And everyone else wants to know what works. Okay. Well,
01:37:33.36 --> 01:37:36.64 there's not everyone figured out on their own what works. That's what he's the thing.
01:37:37.60 --> 01:37:42.48 You're morning routine. You're ultimately right. And I think this is that super important not
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:48.96 to forget or not to like miss interpret where you know, you just, the quote, you just said like
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:52.88 you're morning routines and not going to be the solution to your problems kind of thing. I think
01:37:52.88 --> 01:37:56.96 that's what people do think. I think that that here someone with a level height in my opinion,
01:37:56.96 --> 01:38:01.36 I don't, I don't know. But this is what it seems like where someone with a level head and they
01:38:01.36 --> 01:38:06.000 want to look for just that just just set one thing that's going to help them just a little bit.
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.84 Yeah. So they're going to be like, hey, let me, let me formulate a good morning routine. I
01:38:09.84 --> 01:38:14.48 don't know that much about effective routines. So let me look into that. Just as a little helper,
01:38:14.48 --> 01:38:19.12 not the solution to my problems, which I think some people may kind of miss, no, you're right.
01:38:19.12 --> 01:38:25.04 And that's why, like I said, I'm not belittling the idea that a morning routine is helpful because
01:38:25.04 --> 01:38:35.60 it certainly is. It might add some, some tiny bit of help to your day, if you're doing the right thing.
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:42.000 Some benefits. Thank you. It might benefit your day, which is positive. Will it cure your overall
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.28 problems of life? No, but you know what? It's a good place to start. That's why we say wake up early,
01:38:47.28 --> 01:38:51.52 right? Yeah. That's part of the interview. Part of the part of the routine. So yeah. But even how you,
01:38:51.52 --> 01:38:56.64 I guess I am being a jerk. Yeah, but here's the thing. It seems like, let me just, let me just,
01:38:56.64 --> 01:39:01.68 like, yeah, get on a good morning routine. That's a good idea. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not trying
01:39:01.68 --> 01:39:06.64 to make fun of it. I was, but I'm not anymore. It seems like you're making fun of it for people,
01:39:06.64 --> 01:39:10.64 because this is what it may be sounded like when someone asks you. What's your morning routine?
01:39:10.64 --> 01:39:15.84 It sounds like you're kind of with this presumption, like you're presuming or assuming that
01:39:16.48 --> 01:39:20.40 they think it's going to solve all their problems. That's kind of what I'm making or jerk. Yes,
01:39:20.40 --> 01:39:25.60 but in that very specific direction. Like if someone says, hey, look, I'm always looking for
01:39:25.60 --> 01:39:31.20 things to benefit my day, my effectiveness, you know, I do this and do that. And I found that this
01:39:31.20 --> 01:39:34.72 even helps a little bit here. And hey, what's your morning routine? Maybe I can incorporate one
01:39:34.72 --> 01:39:38.72 or more. Oh, yeah. If you're a two-million to mine, that'll give me a little bit of help, too.
01:39:38.72 --> 01:39:41.76 I don't think you would have came off like that. Definitely. Definitely that would have been a very
01:39:41.76 --> 01:39:45.60 good question. Yes. Oh, yeah. Here's what I do. Yeah. So there you go. So you didn't how you
01:39:45.60 --> 01:39:51.44 said the question, like you were kind of impersonating the hypothetical question. What's your
01:39:51.44 --> 01:39:55.52 morning routine? Like making them sound like you're not going to be. Yes. Sorry. Sorry,
01:39:55.52 --> 01:40:00.96 sorry, everyone. No, not so good. So good. We got to the bottom of it. You know, you're drinking water.
01:40:01.52 --> 01:40:06.48 Another drink you can drink is you can drink something called Jocco White Tea. Sure. It's available
01:40:06.48 --> 01:40:14.24 on Amazon. Now, this is the only tea available. Not only in America, but in the world that comes
01:40:14.24 --> 01:40:21.44 within 8,000 pound deadlift guarantee. So there's no other tea. I know there's some out there that
01:40:21.44 --> 01:40:26.64 are better, they say 6,000. They say they can get you 6,000 pound deadlift. Yeah. There's I've seen
01:40:26.64 --> 01:40:33.76 I've seen 7,200. Right? 7,200. 7,200. Some teas. Some white teas say they'll get you 7,200.
01:40:33.76 --> 01:40:40.24 There's only one white tea that'll get you the guaranteed 8,000 pound deadlift. Good.
01:40:40.24 --> 01:40:45.76 There's some layers on the tea, which I kind of remember last time, but I went in or interrupt
01:40:45.76 --> 01:40:53.36 you. You're talking is first episode of this podcast. Absolute first one. Oh, yeah. I think the only
01:40:53.36 --> 01:40:58.96 one that doesn't start with this is Ducco podcast. That's because you had a different vision
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:05.60 of the podcast. The time with no, we, yeah. Nonetheless, it started with you were thinking,
01:41:05.60 --> 01:41:11.12 I think this podcast is gonna be 100% cruising. That's what it felt like. That first one,
01:41:11.12 --> 01:41:16.08 that's what it felt like. Yeah. No, in your mind. Yeah. In my mind. If you listen,
01:41:16.08 --> 01:41:20.24 yeah, now you were in good sea. I was not, you know, I was not ready to cruise. I came in there with a
01:41:20.24 --> 01:41:24.80 game plan. Yeah. And the game plan did not take cruise on it. The game plan said, get after.
01:41:24.80 --> 01:41:29.28 Well, it was fun. You shut it down so quick. Right when you heard it, you were like, you know,
01:41:29.28 --> 01:41:35.52 you want to cut it at this point, not the little, like we just rolled into a conversation. Yeah.
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:40.000 But here's the thing with that conversation. As far as the layers go, we talk about white tea.
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.84 Yeah. You called it chai. Yeah. No, because I was trying to remember what kind of tea that was.
01:41:43.84 --> 01:41:48.64 I don't know about the tea, especially back then. Nonetheless, you were always on the pomegranate.
01:41:48.64 --> 01:41:55.60 Yeah. That started when I was in the dirt. So anyway, so anyways, you can get that. You can get it on
01:41:55.60 --> 01:42:03.52 Amazon and then you can start deadlifting properly. Yeah. There's some books that you can get.
01:42:03.52 --> 01:42:09.92 Way the warrior kid. I get questions all the time about how you should raise your kids.
01:42:09.92 --> 01:42:13.76 Mm-hmm. And not just how to raise them, because they people know how to raise them, but they,
01:42:13.76 --> 01:42:18.32 but they, not how to raise them, but how to raise them. Like they know what they want the kids to,
01:42:18.96 --> 01:42:22.24 they know the values that they want the kids to have, but they're not sure how to give them the values.
01:42:22.24 --> 01:42:28.32 Right. They don't know how to do that. So it, real simple, get them this book. Way the warrior kid.
01:42:28.32 --> 01:42:33.76 That's, you know, discipline, eating habits, working out, dealing with bullies, how to study
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:38.80 all those things are in there. These are the things you want. Not just your kid, but the children
01:42:38.80 --> 01:42:47.44 of the world to have these type of qualities. And now on top of that, we have way the warrior
01:42:47.44 --> 01:42:53.12 kid, too, which is called marksmission, talks about some important lessons, controlling your temper,
01:42:54.16 --> 01:43:02.64 overcoming fear of failure, working hard, saving money, being frugal, dealing with verbal abuse,
01:43:02.64 --> 01:43:08.48 helping other people, starting businesses. Yeah. I said that. Mm-hmm. And
01:43:09.76 --> 01:43:15.92 becoming a leader. Again, all the, there's no human being that would look at the lessons from
01:43:15.92 --> 01:43:22.56 way of the warrior kid and say, I don't want my kid to have that quality. No, the qualities are in there.
01:43:24.56 --> 01:43:32.64 So there's that. And if you want a good example of a warrior kid, check out IrishOx Ranch.com,
01:43:32.64 --> 01:43:38.08 where you can get soap that's handmade by young Aiden. Who's 12 years old, but he has a business,
01:43:38.08 --> 01:43:44.96 no big deal. He's making soap. Yeah. Was it just a goat milk soap? Yeah, that soap's actually good.
01:43:44.96 --> 01:43:51.04 Like to use. Oh, for sure. For sure. It's face it. You know how you have your friend and, you know,
01:43:51.04 --> 01:43:55.44 his wife makes soap on the weekend. Oh, yeah. You've sympathy purchase scenario. Yeah, you know,
01:43:55.44 --> 01:44:00.24 and you've got some sympathy purchase. And it's beautiful. It has the little packaging. And then you
01:44:00.24 --> 01:44:03.12 say, all right, it's soap. Let me go ahead and use some soap and you're like,
01:44:03.12 --> 01:44:07.92 brother, this isn't like usable soap. This is the novelty decorative item. It was a cool little
01:44:07.92 --> 01:44:13.04 educational experience because he asked me, you know, he was making soap. And he's, and he reached out to me,
01:44:13.04 --> 01:44:20.72 his dad is a farmer also a firefighter, but he's a farmer. Anyways, his dad and I were connected.
01:44:20.72 --> 01:44:26.80 I'd buy meat from his dad and, you know, he said, oh, my son wants to get in touch with you. But
01:44:26.80 --> 01:44:31.92 so as we're going through the process, he sends me like his label for the soap. Yeah. And,
01:44:31.92 --> 01:44:38.08 you know, it looked nice, but I'm going back with those needs to be in OCR standard. Yeah. And
01:44:38.08 --> 01:44:43.04 so anyways, yeah, it's cool little learning process. And yeah, you can get that soap. You can
01:44:43.04 --> 01:44:49.84 support a kid. That's a warrior kid. And the jocco soap motto, which I give aid, no credit for.
01:44:49.84 --> 01:44:55.36 Sorry, you're a good kid, but you didn't think of this. It took the, it took the master
01:44:55.36 --> 01:45:00.16 for marketing mind or jocco to come up with the motto for jocco soap, which is,
01:45:00.16 --> 01:45:07.68 stay clean. It's good. And you know, there's some layers on that too, right? I like it.
01:45:07.68 --> 01:45:11.92 What's the layer? Motorhead song. Oh, all right. There you go. And you like motorhead.
01:45:11.92 --> 01:45:16.88 And I, and a huge fan of motorhead. And you don't do any drug. So there's, there's kind of
01:45:16.88 --> 01:45:22.80 the reason that whenever I talk to people or people talk to me on the through social media or email
01:45:22.80 --> 01:45:28.88 and they've had a drug problem or an alcohol problem. And I always kind of sign off like, hey, stay clean.
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.24 Stay clean. So because that's also what Lemmy from Motorhead was saying, stay clean. Like,
01:45:36.24 --> 01:45:41.36 don't let this kill you. Now Lemmy from Motorhead was a rare dude who did a lot of drugs now
01:45:41.36 --> 01:45:47.44 call and somehow was able to survive very well up to up to when he died drinking incredible amounts
01:45:47.44 --> 01:45:55.28 of jackdannels. Yeah, those some legit layers. But he always would say don't do it. He's a guy
01:45:55.28 --> 01:46:00.56 that would say don't do it. It's don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do what people do. Don't do drugs.
01:46:00.56 --> 01:46:07.20 Yeah. Stay clean. Stay clean. There you go. In addition to that, we got another book called
01:46:07.20 --> 01:46:11.92 the Discipline equals Freedom Field Manual. And if this is, this is a good point. If you know
01:46:11.92 --> 01:46:18.16 someone that's off the path, right? Like people go off the path in life. And it doesn't take,
01:46:18.16 --> 01:46:22.40 we talked about this last time. It doesn't take, but one step off the path when you're on a slippery slope.
01:46:23.20 --> 01:46:27.92 It's a slippery slope when you step off the path. So if you know someone that
01:46:28.88 --> 01:46:33.92 has taken a step off the path and they're starting to slide down, get them this book to get them
01:46:33.92 --> 01:46:42.08 on the path, the right path. And there's also a chance that the person that stepped off the path
01:46:42.08 --> 01:46:51.68 is you. So get the field manual. It's got the thoughts and actions that are required to be on the right
01:46:51.68 --> 01:47:03.52 path. Make yourself better, faster, stronger, smarter. Anything else? More physically fit.
01:47:03.52 --> 01:47:12.08 And healthier. The audio version that is on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.
01:47:12.08 --> 01:47:16.72 It's not unautable because then you can't have it as an album with tracks, which we obviously
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:22.88 support. Extreme ownership. First book, I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin. Over a million copies sold.
01:47:23.92 --> 01:47:28.56 That's a lot of copies sold. That's a lot of copies sold. You know how many copies they told us
01:47:28.56 --> 01:47:32.96 would be successful? Because we didn't know anything about the publishing world.
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:37.52 Wait, what do you mean? When we were getting, when the book was getting ready to come out
01:47:37.52 --> 01:47:41.04 and I would talk to the publisher, Lave and I were talking to the publisher.
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.32 And he says, you know if this is a successful book then you know, it'll really be, it'll be good to see
01:47:46.32 --> 01:47:51.12 blah blah blah. So they like the standard like a certain amount. That's especially when you
01:47:51.12 --> 01:47:56.88 confess it. No, so I said, hey, what? I don't know anything about this. What is considered to be a
01:47:56.88 --> 01:48:03.52 successful book? You know what the number was? 20,000 books. You go to hell. No, because hey,
01:48:03.52 --> 01:48:07.52 you know we're putting 12,000 on this first run and if you sell, if you, you know we'll put
01:48:07.52 --> 01:48:11.60 some more but if you can sell 20,000 books, that's, that's going to be that's a huge success.
01:48:11.60 --> 01:48:18.64 And we will be proud. So here we are. We're one million. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Good job,
01:48:18.64 --> 01:48:26.000 Lave Babin. Good job. Good job both. Yeah. Lave tells a story that we got home from Ramadhi
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.48 and the only time I ever told him anything positive was when we got home, we'd been home for like two
01:48:30.48 --> 01:48:39.12 weeks and I told him the Delta put in a commander. Hey, good job over there. So yeah, we're keep,
01:48:39.12 --> 01:48:44.32 I like to keep it real. Yeah, man. And actually, you know what the good job over there seems real
01:48:44.32 --> 01:48:50.40 simple, but I'm sure in that context, he was probably the most loaded. Yeah. Good job. Anyone's ever heard.
01:48:50.40 --> 01:48:57.20 Yeah. Yeah. I believe you're correct. Beyond the books and beyond the podcast, also,
01:48:57.20 --> 01:49:02.000 Ashalon front speaking of Lave and me, this is our leadership and management consulting company.
01:49:02.64 --> 01:49:09.12 This is the thing, every, this is a bold statement, right? Every problem in every organization is
01:49:09.12 --> 01:49:16.72 leadership problem. That's a bold statement to make. Yeah. And I'll say again, every problem in every
01:49:16.72 --> 01:49:22.40 organization is a leadership problem. So if there's a problem in an organization, the problem,
01:49:22.40 --> 01:49:28.88 it boils down to leadership on some level. So what we do is we fix the leadership and there,
