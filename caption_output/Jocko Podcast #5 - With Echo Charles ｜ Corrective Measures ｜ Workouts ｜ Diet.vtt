This is Jocco podcast number five with echo Charles and me.

2
00:00:07.80 --> 00:00:10.60
Jocco willing. Good evening echo Charles.

3
00:00:10.60 --> 00:00:18.000
It's evening. Welcome to podcast number five. Here we are. Here we are number five.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you everyone for joining us.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So tonight I got asked on Twitter.

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Hey, could you talk about coaching some people?

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And that kind of prompted me to think about something that I have pulled out in the past when I'm teaching some leadership classes.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And what this is is two counseling notes that I wrote for sessions when I was trying to help a couple of seal leaders improve themselves and get better.

9
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And the first one was for a seal that was a buddy of mine and who was a little bit junior to me.

10
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Just a little bit junior in me in rank.

11
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But you know, because I was a prior and listed seal.

12
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I had actually burned in the seal teams for a much longer time.

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this guy was a great great leader, great guy and very passionate about doing a solid job and very passionate about the seal teams.

14
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Which is an awesome thing to see.

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And with that passion and I've said this before, sometimes your strength can be a weakness.

16
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And sometimes you would get a little bit too passionate about stuff and a little bit emotional and be a little bit easy to read.

17
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And so I was in a meeting with him and I kind of saw him reacting to how other people were reacting to him.

18
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And so when I saw that, I kind of sat down and just put some words on paper to let him know that he had a little area of improvement.

19
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And what's good about this is, you know, I was the detached person.

20
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So I was able to sit outside the situation and just watch and see, oh, that's that he's not coming across the way he thinks he's coming across.

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And so I started off with that one.

22
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It was pretty positive echo.

23
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
When you when you say put words on paper, is that like an official thing, you know, like when you get written up at work or something, it's like here's a real warning.

24
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Right, this one was not this was just a bro saying, hey man, here's some here's some tips almost like a deal note almost.

25
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a deal note.

26
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So what's interesting is there's there's in the seal teams, there's not a lot of writing up on in this in this capacity.

27
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And if somebody has a safety violation, where they do something unsafe, they get to written up immediately.

28
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But this type of thing is a little bit, you know, because normally you're just trying to bring someone along and help them out and improve their leadership, you know, it's just mentoring.

29
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So a lot of times that you don't need to document when you're trying to help out your buddies.

30
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That's why I'm kind of lucky here.

31
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I forget what it was, but I, you know, I went to a meeting, he was in it and I kind of forget the situation, but for whatever reason I wrote this down.

32
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I sent it to him and today let's talk about this later, but just just wanted to give you this stuff, you know, now.

33
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so I'm kind of lucky that I wrote it down is kind of like in the spirit of organization.

34
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Yeah, and just I think it was more of just I couldn't talk to him immediately, right?

35
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Right, whatever reason.

36
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Yeah, it's our just sentiment email.

37
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Just, just what I like left it on his desk, I forget if it was digital's probably email, but.

39
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, here we go.

40
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And there's there's some interesting comments in here and that's why I think I saved it and that's why I think it's it's good conversation.

41
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So here we go. Here's my note to a seal leader that is a buddy trying to try to move along his leadership paradigm.

42
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And here we go.

43
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
One, leadership is getting people to do things.

44
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is a form of manipulation.

45
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So, right there, I use this word that everybody hates manipulation.

46
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And people often replace that word with influence.

47
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I do it too. You know, I say, oh, you want to use your influence, but what you're really saying is you want to manipulate people.

48
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But it's very negative.

49
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And the way I break that down, the way I separate that from something negative and something positive is,

50
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
if I'm trying to manipulate you in a negative way, that means I want you to do something that's going to benefit me and it's going to hurt you.

51
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
To me, that's manipulation, that's negative.

52
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But if you're trying to influence someone, you're trying to lead them.

53
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
You're still manipulating them, but you're trying to get something that's going to be positive for them and positive for the team.

54
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So, as far as I'm concerned, when you're influencing someone, you're really manipulating for a positive outcome.

55
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So, but that being said, I think people need to recognize that.

56
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And that's why I use that word because everyone knows what manipulation is.

57
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You're trying to get someone to do something.

58
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And that's what leadership is.

59
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
If you think about it, you're trying to get someone to do something, but I use that word, so it's very clear what you're trying to do.

60
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Leadership is nothing more than getting people to do what you want, both up and down the chain of command.

61
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So, not just the people below you want the people above you to do what you want them to do.

62
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000
More importantly, getting them to do what you want them to do, is the best form of leadership and the highest form of manipulation.

63
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So, this is a situation where you don't even want, you want the person just to want to do what you're getting them to do.

64
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Right?

65
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So, now I go on.

66
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Every time we open our mouths to speak to another person, our goals to get them to do what we want them to do.

67
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Otherwise, why the hell are we talking?

68
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, everything you say, the tone of your voice, the words you choose, the inflection on those words,

69
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and body language and facial expression are all tools to be used to make progress in getting your way.

70
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Or, tools that you misuse and isolate yourself and move away from your goals.

71
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, again, I wanted to make sure that this guy knew that every little facial expression, everything that he said,

72
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and how he said it all those things have an impact because people forget that.

73
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:51.000
You'll realize how important your words are and how important your facial expressions are and how important your tone is and how that impacts people.

74
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You are always in negotiation.

75
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Everything you say and do and the manner in which you say and do it has an impact on future outcomes.

76
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Pretty simple.

77
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Now, this is when I say this to people, they go, ooh.

78
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, here it is.

79
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The best way to win is when the other person doesn't know you won and if possible, might not even know there was a fight.

80
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
If your ego requires the constant food of victory, you can never win in this manner.

81
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So, just to restate that, the best way to win in a competition of getting something to happen or getting someone to do something,

82
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the best way to win is when they don't even know that you won and even better than that is that they don't even know that there was a game.

83
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
They don't even know that they're doing this for a reason other than by their own free will.

84
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
That's what they think.

85
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That's what you want them to think.

86
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And again, this is manipulation.

87
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And I'm sorry about that.

88
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The thing is, is that you're manipulating for positive outcomes.

89
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
You're not manipulating for your own benefit.

90
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You're not manipulating for to make bad something bad happen that person.

91
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
You're influencing them so that they do a better job so the team does better so that the mission gets accomplished.

92
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now I go on.

93
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Creating adversarial or antagonistic relationships never helps you reach end goals.

94
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
This is slightly related to the old, keep your friends close to enemies closer.

95
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
People that outright oppose me will never help me and will usually maneuver to hurt my cause.

96
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This is never good.

97
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
At least a neutral relationship seldom results in someone actively sabotaging my efforts.

98
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So it's really easy to get an adversarial relationships.

99
00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And that wasn't one of my little go-to words that I used to use when talking to my subordinate leadership.

100
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Adversarial relationships.

101
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You know I'd say, hey, you're starting to get into an adversarial relationship with this person.

102
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And where is that going to go?

103
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And I would say it's never going to be good.

104
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
They're never going to go out of their way to help you.

105
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
In fact, when you're an adversarial somebody, they go out of their way to sabotage you and hurt you.

106
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And that's, that's just never going to be helpful.

107
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So now go on to say, your history reveals that you are good at getting into adversarial situations.

108
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You should work to control that impulse.

109
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It will never help you attain your goals.

110
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And that's, you know, you're laughing because that's a very blunt statement.

111
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Right?

112
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That's a very blunt statement.

113
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Your history reveals that you are good at getting into adversarial situations.

114
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You're good at it.

115
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Oh, yeah.

116
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That's a skill.

117
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah.

118
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You're real good at it.

119
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And you can see this is this is a pretty blunt, put it pretty blunt writing here.

120
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And the reason is because I had a relationship with this guy.

121
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You know, he was open to hear what I had to say.

122
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And so it wasn't like I was just being a jerk.

123
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And I was going to put him on the defensive.

124
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And he knew that.

125
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And he knew that I was always, you know, looking out for his best interest.

126
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And I knew he would look out for mine as well.

127
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So we had a very good relationship.

128
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Going on.

129
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Don't burn bridges.

130
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Period.

131
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Nothing is ever gained by this.

132
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The future is never known.

133
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.40
And I always do what I can to keep lines of communication, open, bridges intact, and reinforce

134
00:10:33.40 --> 00:10:35.000
defossible.

135
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So why burn bridges?

136
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So seldom in life.

137
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Should you burn a bridge.

138
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.20
And a lot of times people think because I'm a seal and I'm aggressive that I'm like this kind of

139
00:10:52.20 --> 00:10:55.000
burn bridges type of person, right?

140
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And it's.

141
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's just not true because it's not an effective way to go through life.

142
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now I go on to make a note about that.

143
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I don't like to say never.

144
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
But when dealing with human relationships, which are inherently complex and the unperpressed

145
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
complex and unpredictable, I believe that you should never follow courses of action that cannot be undone,

146
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
reversed or manipulated in the future.

147
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now, of course, now I'm talking about, you know, people on the same team.

148
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I'm not talking about, you know, going to war.

149
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And there you obviously do things in war that are completely unreversible because you're destroying and

150
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
killing people.

151
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They're never coming back.

152
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So this is different.

153
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
This is this is in a team situation where you're trying to work together and you're in a leadership.

154
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You're in a leadership role.

155
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Going on.

156
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Believe in what you're saying, but accept that you might be wrong.

157
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I believe in what I'm saying.

158
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And if I don't believe it, I study and question it until it makes sense.

159
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Or I change what I am saying until I do believe it.

160
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That's a little hard to understand that last piece.

161
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So what I'm saying is you've got to believe in what you're saying.

162
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And if you don't believe it, then you've got to either question whatever it is that you're being told

163
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the believe or that you should believe that you're supposed to believe.

164
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
You've got to question that until you understand it.

165
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And then once you understand it, then you have belief in it.

166
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And you know, I'm not going to go into crazy detail on that because in our book,

167
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that that life and I wrote, you know, there's a chapter and it's called belief.

168
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And it explains exactly what I'm talking about when it comes to making sure that you believe in what you're saying.

169
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
But I think the point that I was focused on here was more that sometimes you're wrong.

170
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And you have to be able to admit when you're wrong.

171
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And I go on to kind of go into some detail here.

172
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
If I'm wrong, I look forward to admitting it because it gives the opportunity to advertise

173
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
being humble and open-minded.

174
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
That's interesting.

175
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And people miss that opportunity all the time.

176
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
When they're wrong, either put their foot down and deny it or they don't take advantage of the fact that they go that that went

177
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to wrong, they say, oh, you know what I go?

178
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I'm definitely wrong here.

179
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I think you had a much better idea.

180
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Let's step in back and you run with it.

181
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
That's a great sign.

182
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It makes people respect you and go, oh, yeah, that's cool.

183
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
This guy, this guy is humble enough to admit when he's wrong.

184
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And they like that.

185
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So that's actually a form of manipulation.

186
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
It's own right because I want you to think that I'm humble.

187
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And I am humble.

188
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
But I want to make sure that you see that.

189
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
I go on to tell this individual, you're not good at being wrong or taking criticism.

190
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This is a weakness of yours so recognize, fool.

191
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And again, you can see the air.

192
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
That's where the kind of relationship that I have with them comes out.

193
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
All right, you really put that.

194
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yeah, I know that's real.

195
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This is real.

196
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And this is written, I would say maybe eight years ago, something like that.

197
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
That's pretty old.

198
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Thank God for computers because we have, you know, records of things.

199
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
All right, right.

200
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
They've saved it. Right control S yeah, for sure.

201
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Now I go on.

202
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Think strategic.

203
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You will win and lose daily battles all the time.

204
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
If you flaunt your victories, which you do, they hurt you strategically.

205
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
If you soak in your defeats, which you also do, it hurts you strategically.

206
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
This is wrong.

207
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Winning and daily battles gives you the opportunity to deflect credit,

208
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
show your humbleness and victory, and show your ability to lead, which all help you in the long-term fight to achieve your goals.

209
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Losing a battle gives you the opportunity to generously, generously, see your position to admit your wrong,

210
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
which both display humbleness and display your ability to follow.

211
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So people, it every business and every job in life, in your house, you win and lose little battles all the time.

212
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And deciding which ones are worth fighting for number one.

213
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And then when you do win them, how do you act?

214
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And then when you lose them, how do you act?

215
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And all of these, the winning and the losing is not as important as how you act.

216
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Upon winning or losing.

217
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And how you, it continued to influence the situation, even though you might have lost.

218
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
You do it in such a way that you show humility and you open up, you show your open mind.

219
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And it makes the person build your relationship with them.

220
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So winning or losing is not important.

221
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
What's important is how you react to winning and losing.

222
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
When you say you're sorry, if two people are in a relationship or even friends and get into an argument, whatever,

223
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
whatever.

224
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And one person may not want to say they're sorry, because I don't show that I was wrong or it'll show that I lost the argument or show that my points were invalid or whatever they think.

225
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But when you say sorry, infernal say sorry, don't be like, I'm sorry if you were offended.

226
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Don't say that kind of stuff. Don't be like, okay, I'm sorry. Don't say like that. Like really mean it.

227
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And when you can do that, consistently it'll be any future argument.

228
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It'll start to break down that barrier of defense.

229
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:49.000
You know, so the person, the people both won't go into it thinking, okay, I got to mount this defense against this person.

230
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Now it can be a little bit more of a fair problem solving situation more so than this argument me against you.

231
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Because they trust they're not going to get attacked if they show weakness or whatever.

232
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:11.000
If they're like, oh, you know what, I know I made a mistake. They get, they you demonstrate by saying, sorry, you demonstrated that you're not going to go and turn up the heat when they start showing that weakness.

233
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
It's like okay, you can solve problems a lot more easy.

234
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
That's that's thinking strategic.

235
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Right. Right.

236
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Speaking to people going on here, speaking to people.

237
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Oh, wait, going back, I say, you have a bad tendency to get caught up in tactical battles.

238
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
You expend effort and ammunition, receive wounds and tear yourself up when you should be thinking strategically.

239
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
That kind of goes to what you were just saying, where people will get all angry and they'll hurt their relationship.

240
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Why? Because they want to win this meaningless battle, meaningless battle.

241
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So detach yourself.

242
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
When you start feeling that anger, that aggression, that frustration, detach yourself.

243
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And ask yourself, what am I really arguing about? What is happening right here? Why am I getting worked up? You probably shouldn't be.

244
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Now, I go on to speaking to people.

245
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, literally speaking to people.

246
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Treat everyone with respect from E1 to O10. E1 in the military is the lowest ranking person.

247
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
O10, an officer. 10 is the highest that would be an admiral or a general.

248
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
The E1 is the, is the seam and recruit the lowest ranking person.

249
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I'm saying treat everyone with respect.

250
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Speak with humility. This disarms people and is one of the best forms of manipulation.

251
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And again, if everyone is, is put off by that term, manipulation, which I know, it is a very derogatory term.

252
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
And, but you have to get over that, because you have to understand what I'm trying to say.

253
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
I'm trying to make sure that people understand that when you're in a leadership position,

254
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
there's nice ways of saying it, but what you're trying to do is get people to do what you want them to do.

255
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
That's what leadership is. And that's also what manipulation is.

256
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Disarmed people are open to suggestion.

257
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Overconfidence and condescending tone, which is common for you,

258
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
causes defenses to go up and people to get defensive.

259
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
So, the minute you come in and you start being over confident or talking to people in a condescending manner,

260
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
they get defensive and all of a sudden they're not really listening.

261
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000
That being said, subtle confidence and believing in what you are saying as noted above,

262
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000
allowing people to also believe in what you are saying and that they trust in your judgment and leadership.

263
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
However, do not speak as if you know things your opponent does not.

264
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
That offends everyone, especially seals.

265
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
So you never, never like talk to people as if you know something that they don't.

266
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You know, because it offends people. It offends me. It offends everybody.

267
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
It's impossible not to be offended by that. It makes you feel stupid, you get defensive.

268
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So, you've got to say things in a manner that you don't sound like I know it and you don't.

269
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Right?

270
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Your rank means nothing in an argument.

271
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Pulling rank in any way is defeat.

272
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
So the minute I have to say echo, I outrank you there for them, right?

273
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Means I couldn't. It means my argument didn't make sense.

274
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
It should be able to stand on its own two feet and similar to that.

275
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And this is something we saw a lot in the serial teams and you see it a lot in the business world as well.

276
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It's similar to rank. It's the experience. It's pulling the experience card.

277
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Pulling the experience card is weak.

278
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Arguments should be able to stand on their own without needing to be backed up by the way we did it in Baghdad,

279
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
the way we did it in Ramadi, the way we did it in Afghanistan or whatever the case may be.

280
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
You shouldn't need to say that. Now you can cite an example, but that shouldn't be the basis of your argument.

281
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And we see that in the business world where someone will say, well, we've been through this before.

282
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And well, why did you go through it before?

283
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Then why are we going through it again if you went through it before? Maybe you did something wrong.

284
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:20.000
But that's a tendency that people have. In the business world, you end up with people that have been in a specific industry for 20, 30, 40 years.

285
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And so it's very easy for them just to fall back on the, well, this is the way we've done it before.

286
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I've seen this a million times. I've always done it. I've done this before. I've been through this before. You've heard all these examples.

287
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
It's what people do.

288
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Also, like if people, they're in some kind of debate or argument about whatever, solar system, no, be like, oh, I have a college degree.

289
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Almost like my argument is better than yours. Regardless of what it is because I have that college degree.

290
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Yeah, I have an example of that where a young seal was feeling as if he was being disrespected about what?

291
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
That he had no very much. He's a pretty new seal.

292
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And he fell back on the argument of exactly what you said.

293
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It was like, you know, I have a degree in problem solving or something.

294
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I mean, I've been to classes on problems solving. That was his reason why people should listen to him.

295
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Which is not a good card to pull out in any situation and definitely not in the seal.

296
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Hey, I've been to a class on problem solving. You, you need to listen to me.

297
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Wait a second. Why don't you just present your solution?

298
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And then let it stand on its own to feet because if you're so good at problem solving, then we surely must have a wonderful solution.

299
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yeah, you take that class first.

300
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
But yes, it's the same thing. So to close this thing out, I said, anyway, those are some thoughts.

301
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I thought about this today after we had that conversation.

302
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
I left thinking about my principles of management leadership off the battlefield in administrative situations.

303
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
These are the same principles I used in combat building relationships and leading.

304
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I also used them in administrative leadership situations and as you know, I've been successful in that environment as well.

305
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
You're a great leader. Just make some adjustments to your game and you'll be even better.

306
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And that's it. That's how I closed out to this guy who was, you know, got this note from me and hit me back and say, hey, man, thanks.

307
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
That's good stuff and all that action and definitely improve this game with it.

308
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Now that's a pretty nice counseling session or nice attempt to help somebody.

309
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Now this next example that I'm going to go through is somebody that was on his last legs.

310
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
He was in a leadership position and he was having some significant problems.

311
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Now he was an inexperienced guy and for some unknown reason he was cocky.

312
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
He was arrogant. He was failing as a leader and he'd been through multiple verbal counseling.

313
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Like I talked about him. He asked me to rewrite people up. I mean, the seal teams for writing somebody up for a leadership problem.

314
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
They've been counsel numerous times verbally because you don't expect him to not that hard.

315
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
You know, it's not that hard to say, hey, make this adjustment. The guy goes, oh, yeah, okay. I didn't see that. I was doing that.

316
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000
The only time you end up with someone that you have to actually write it down is when someone gets starts getting to a point where you say, okay, this person's job is now in jeopardy.

317
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
And this is again, thanks to technology. I saved this.

318
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Thanks to technology.

319
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
So here we go. Seldom, do I have to do this?

320
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Most guys listen and adjust and get better and move on.

321
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
My cadre, meaning the training crew that I had, my cadre and your leadership asked that I talked to you.

322
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:13.000
And it is my job and my duty and my responsibility to try and make square away tactical seal leaders.

323
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Know this. I have personally worked with and seen all kinds of patoon commanders with all kinds of personalities.

324
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
If you count my previous experience in patoons and training cell and as an elicited man, the number is pretty big.

325
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I've done seven deployments serving in every spot from the youngest E3 new guy to the oldest and the task unit commander.

326
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
That being said, I'm not that good at anything, but I am a hard worker.

327
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I don't like to waste my time with people that don't appear to have the desire to be better seals.

328
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
And you don't appear to have a desire to improve yourself despite your history, which includes the following.

329
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Getting bad fit reps, so fit reps is short for fitness reports and that's basically an evaluation.

330
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
And this guy had really bad evaluations.

331
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Just like general evaluation. Yeah. It's good.

332
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Well, it's fitness fitness is like one block, but there will be a block on leadership.

333
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
There will be a block on tactical knowledge.

334
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So there's all these blocks in his, we had bad fitness reports, bad evaluations.

335
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Getting sent to a staff billet as a junior officer, so they took him.

336
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And instead of making him and putting him a seal, puttoon, they had him in some administrative job, which is a big signal.

337
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Sometimes they'll do that in between tours or after you do an assistant platoon commander tour, they'll give you a tour like that to expand your knowledge, but he just got put straight into that.

338
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000
So that wasn't good. And finally, having a horrible reputation in the teams, which this individual certainly did have.

339
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Now, I go on and say, I didn't take this into account when looking at you as a seal officer and as a man.

340
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
I don't care what people say. I judge people on what I see with my own eyes.

341
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
At first, I thought you were just another alpha male seal that rubbs people the wrong way. No big deal.

342
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
There are plenty of seals like that.

343
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I usually like them. Most of my true friends fall into that category.

344
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
And that was one of the things about this guy. You know, he was like a big guy.

345
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And he was pretty aggressive.

346
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And I thought to myself, just what I said, I thought, okay, you know what, maybe he's rubbing the people the wrong way and then people are little intimidated by that.

347
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
As time passed, I began to see something different.

348
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
This is what I see.

349
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
You are insecure about something. I don't know what, but it forces you to act arrogant and come across as selfish.

350
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Your performance as a tactical leader varies between below average and average with some visible spikes of increased potential.

351
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
You're almost incapable of communicating with other people respectfully.

352
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So those top three right there.

353
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
For whatever reason that I never figured out what made this individual so insecure, I don't know if he, I have no idea.

354
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I don't know what happened to him.

355
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
It's okay. We have insecurities. We get intimidated.

356
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
We feel like we have to over prove ourselves.

357
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
It's okay. This thing's happened. You just make adjustments.

358
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
That's all you got to do. You got to make some adjustments.

359
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
You got to realize that you're not communicating with people respectfully.

360
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And when somebody tells you that you're not, you got a question.

361
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
What do I sound like? Maybe you pull out of a recorder and listen to yourself.

362
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
You have some good ideas. You have some good ideas from time to time.

363
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
But you act as if you know everything all the time.

364
00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Your ability to elevate your presence to that of a respective leader of men on the battlefield and in Garrison is almost non-existent.

365
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
And I don't know if at this time I was really using the term like detach that much,

366
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
but that's what I was trying to get across to him.

367
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Is that he wasn't able to elevate his presence. He wasn't able to come across like a leader.

368
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
He was right there in mentally with the rest of the bulltune.

369
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Going on, you cannot mask your emotions and you don't understand the ramifications of that shortfall.

370
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So these are the little things, the little I roll.

371
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
The heavy sigh, the crossed arms.

372
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I mean just all these little things that it was like an open book when you'd see this guy.

373
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
You know exactly what he was thinking.

374
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
And he had no idea that it was so obvious to everybody else.

375
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Myself, all the rest of my instructor staff, his leadership, everyone was thinking the same thing.

376
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And in his mind, he was good to go. He was, you know, he was a stone-flaced poker player.

377
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Yeah, it kind of gets worse when you can't mask your emotions,

378
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
but your emotions are reflective of your insecurity, which you mentioned on one of the first things.

379
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
So it's like this double-wamy.

380
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It's one thing if you can't mask your emotions, but you're pretty humble in general and you're a nice guy or whatever you're going with kind of guy.

381
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Yeah, and the emotions that you're not masking are something positive.

382
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Right, it's a bomb positive or a lot of positive, maybe some negative, but hey, no one's perfect kind of thing.

383
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But yeah, if it's just like insecurity, oozing out of the...

384
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Yeah, and the insecurity was really the what oozed out of him was I know everything.

385
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You don't know, look, Jock, I know you've been in the teams for 18 years and you've done multiple appointments overseas.

386
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And even though I have done zero appointments overseas, I know more than you.

387
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Yeah.

388
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Here we go on.

389
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And so now I start trying to make sure I cover all the bases with this guy.

390
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Sure.

391
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:18.000
You do not have the understanding of human nature, team building, leadership, influence, manipulation, compromise, and the broad concepts of tactical operation, operational and strategic leadership and management.

392
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Perhaps you don't have the intellect to understand these things.

393
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Because if you did, why are we sitting here right now talking about this?

394
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And by the way, the reason this is written down, I wrote it down and then brought him into my office, put it in front of him and then read it to him.

395
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Because I wanted to be crystal clear.

396
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Right.

397
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And so that's why this is written in that perspective.

398
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I'm saying, why are we sitting here talking about it right now?

399
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Why am I not thinking this might not be the most polished guy in the world, but he's a good guy and he'll get things done.

400
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Because you end up with plenty of seals that are just, they're just not that polished or they're a little rough around the edges or they can't brief well.

401
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Or whatever.

402
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I mean, it's cool.

403
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
There's all kinds of different guys in the seal teams.

404
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
And you just got to take what you get and you strengthen your weaknesses a little bit.

405
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
But this guy was just not getting there.

406
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
For some reason, you believe that you are a victim.

407
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
That people don't like you or have it out for you and this was so weird.

408
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
This guy had this attitude that everyone wanted to fire him, that everyone was against him.

409
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And he was this, he was in this struggle on his own against the world.

410
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And it was just completely not true.

411
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Especially in the beginning, I mean, obviously it escalated to that, but that he brought it upon himself.

412
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:49.000
But, but honestly, that's something I kind of, I kind of pride myself in, in as a leader in taking a blank slate when I meet somebody and say,

413
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And say, okay, cool, you know, hey, look, this guy's a bad reputation or whatever. I'm going to see what I can do with him.

414
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
I want to make him better.

415
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I kind of take pride in that and want to make people better.

416
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And so for him to think that I was out to get him or the straining cadre was out to get him.

417
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
It's just not true. Just completely not true.

418
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
This is not true, but it isolates you, hurts your ability to interact with people,

419
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
and keeps you in a paranoid, guarded and confrontational state.

420
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
It's rough, rough.

421
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Next, you don't understand the broad skills required to be a good seal leader, such as tact, team building, communications, and trust building.

422
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
So it's interesting, none of this is about fire maneuver.

423
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
None of this is about taking down a building.

424
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
None of this is about, you know, out of how to plan and execute.

425
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And an execute and a salt.

426
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
None of this is about that because that stuff is relatively easy to do.

427
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:03.000
And what we would 99.9% of the time when we fire a leader had nothing to do with their tactical prowess.

428
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:12.000
It had to do with them as a leader. Now, them as a leader affect the tactical outcome of operations for sure.

429
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
But that wouldn't be the key component of their failings.

430
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
The key component of their failings would be their arrogance.

431
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Going on, you do not understand the burden of command.

432
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
You do not understand the influence you have on your men. This is a big one.

433
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
This is one of those ones that I find this with CEOs.

434
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I find this with middle-level managers.

435
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
I find this with everyone where they don't understand their influence on their people.

436
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
They understand when they say something off the cuff.

437
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
That everybody listens and they think they mean it.

438
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And it has real impact on people.

439
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
They understand when they show up late.

440
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Now, being late is okay. When they go home early, going home early is okay.

441
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Those are the little things, examples of little things that people don't understand.

442
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
The influence they have on their troops.

443
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Going on, you do not understand the gift you have been honored with.

444
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000
To lead men in combat against our nation's sworn enemies.

445
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
My concern is how you will act overseas when lives are at stake.

446
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I cannot allow you to go forward with these shortfalls.

447
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And that is something that in the Seal teams.

448
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
So in the Seal teams, people think, well, if someone is no good, you just fire them.

449
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
That's it. And it's actually not true.

450
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
You have to have good reason and document what issues they're having.

451
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
And the other thing is that that's really harsh about firing someone in the Seal teams is

452
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
When you fire someone in the Seal teams, you're ruining their life.

453
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
It's their dream to be a Seal.

454
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Now they're not going to be a Seal anymore.

455
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Their paycheck, their retirement.

456
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
I mean, they've got plans. They're counting on this.

457
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
So when you fire someone in the Seal teams, it can be devastating.

458
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Career blow and it can really ruin someone's life.

459
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Now, there are times where we go, hey, you know what, this guy's going to be okay.

460
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
We need to push him back a little while and your recycle and he'll be able to come back.

461
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And he'll get better and he just needs to learn more.

462
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
That happens as well.

463
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
But in this type of situation, this guy was already with a bad reputation.

464
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
This was going to be, if he got fired from this job, this was going to be a

465
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
death sentence for his career.

466
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
So when you fire someone from the Seal teams, they're not out of the military.

467
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Or it's on the situation.

468
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Sometimes they'll get a lot of times the officers will be removed from the military.

469
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
The listed guys might go to the regular Navy, which is a harsh punishment.

470
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
For a guy that's been in the Seal teams that you in the Seal teams, you have quite a bit of freedom.

471
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
You get more money.

472
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
You're doing some job that you really like and then all of a sudden you're not doing a job that you're like.

473
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
And that can be a severe form of punishment as well.

474
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Is it like going to the miners from the Major League?

475
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
No, it's just a totally different job.

476
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
It's like going from baseball to something completely different.

477
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
I mean, it's going from baseball to doing accounting.

478
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
You know, or from baseball to going to construction.

479
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
You know, because the regular Navy has a regular jobs that are like that.

480
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
There's accounting jobs.

481
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
There's building jobs.

482
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
There's, you know, technical jobs.

483
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
So it's like going from a job that's like a sport, which is the Seal teams going into a job that's more of a job.

484
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
But it's not like a dishonorable discharge situation.

485
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
No, not unless the guys any of you know, it's interesting.

486
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I remember I was on a ship one time.

487
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And the waves were big and it was cold.

488
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And we were launching off this ship in the middle of the night.

489
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
And there was this regular Navy guy, a first class boasts mate, which means, you know, he ran the,

490
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
the deck operations of the ships and putting boats in the water and.

491
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And it was all stormy and dark.

492
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
And we're on these little boats out the middle of the ocean.

493
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We're about to go launch.

494
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And the guy says to me.

495
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Man, I would never want your job.

496
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And that's, you know, that's what he was thinking.

497
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And I look back at him and I said, well, that's good.

498
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Because I would never want yours either.

499
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Because I would never want to be, you know, stuck on a ship and doing that kind of work.

500
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
But it's, we both had jobs that we liked.

501
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Yeah, you know.

502
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Yeah.

503
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Yeah.

504
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Everyone's got jobs.

505
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
They like, but so when I person's in the Seal teams though, and they're getting put to a job, it's normally job that they don't really like.

506
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And what my point in all that.

507
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Is that it is difficult to ruin someone's career.

508
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And it is a heavy burden when you have to do this to somebody.

509
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
That being said, you're going to send these people, especially a person in a leadership position.

510
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
They're going to be overseas and responsible for people's lives.

511
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
You have got to do the right thing.

512
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Yeah.

513
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And I say that to business leaders now.

514
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You know, you've got to do everything you can to mentor someone.

515
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000
And that's actually how I know you've done everything you can to mentoring get someone along.

516
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Because when you fire them, you shouldn't feel guilty about it.

517
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
And when a leader says, I'll really have to feel bad about firing this person.

518
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Okay, then that means you haven't done everything you can to mentor them.

519
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Because if you have, and they still fail, then they're incapable of doing the job.

520
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
And they need to go find a different job.

521
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And then you get put in different positions.

522
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
That's just the facts.

523
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
But if you've done everything you've can and they can't do it, then you have to move on.

524
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
But when you go, oh, I'm feeling bad about getting rid of this person.

525
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Because you haven't had this conversation that I'm having with this guy right here.

526
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
The laying it out and saying, here's what you're doing wrong.

527
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Here's how you need to fix it.

528
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
This is what the expectations are.

529
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And if you don't meet them, you're not going to be here.

530
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
You need to clearly understand that.

531
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Yeah, it really puts it into perspective.

532
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Right on that last item there, one, when you said, my concern is how you would act overseas.

533
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
One lives are at stake.

534
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Like that really puts it into perspective.

535
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
I mean, really looking at it in a lighthearted kind of way, you can kind of compare this to, let's say,

536
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
you know, when you're in kindergarten, you get a report card or whatever.

537
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
And then at the end, if you're a kid like this guy, you get a little note at the end says does,

538
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
all it does does not play well with others.

539
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Right.

540
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
You're like, all right, you know, it doesn't mean whatever.

541
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
This is especially when this is the adult version of that, but times it by like 10.

542
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
And it sums it up right here with that last one, like one lives are at stake.

543
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
And that's exactly what was going on.

544
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.000
So here, I tried to give this guy corrective measures is what I call corrective measures.

545
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Number one, be humble.

546
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And we get asked all the time what's the most important characteristic of a leader.

547
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
And life and I will say, all the time humility.

548
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:43.000
And if you're not humble, then how can you look at yourself and say, I need to do stuff better.

549
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
How can you look at your team and say we need to get better?

550
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
How can you look at your enemy and say, I better respect them?

551
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
If you don't have that humility, you're going to fail there.

552
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
So my first corrective action of this guy, be humble.

553
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Number two, truly and deeply accept the fact that you have some serious personality defects that you need to immediately put in check and over the long term completely fix.

554
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
So I was very concerned that this guy was going to sit there not as head.

555
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Yeah, okay, yeah, sorry, but not truly and deeply accept the fact that he had these issues because there's a big difference between on your head and saying, I got you sir, okay, sir, yeah sir.

556
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I'm going to do better.

557
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:43.000
There's a big difference between that and going home looking in the mirror and saying, I've got some serious problems that I need to fix.

558
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I'm going on understand that the criticism you are hearing from me is not mine alone, but also my staffs and your leaderships as well.

559
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
I've also heard this from other people outside your command.

560
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Your reputation is horrible.

561
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Again, I wanted to make sure that he didn't think this was just Jocco being hostile.

562
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
I wanted to realize it was my entire staff and his leadership that was being hostile.

563
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Going on, corrective measure, embrace and contemplate the solemn responsibility of being a seal officer about to lead men into battle and possibly to their deaths and brace the burden of command.

564
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:54.000
This is one that for me was very disturbing to see because I had let that in the battle and I had my guys get killed.

565
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
So to have him with this attitude where I could see that didn't occur in his brain.

566
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
He didn't understand that these guys that he's supposed to be in charge of, he's going to be asking them to do things that can get him killed.

567
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And I don't think he understood that.

568
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
The burden of command, that's the burden of command.

569
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
That's that heavy responsibility.

570
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And yes, in combat, it means guys getting wounded or getting killed.

571
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:40.000
And that is a heavy burden. But I will tell you in the business world, when you've got people's jobs at stake, when you've got the profitability or the survival of a company at stake and

572
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
dozens or hundreds or thousands of people may or may not have a job.

573
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:55.000
If you don't do your job correctly as a leader, that is a heavy burden as well.

574
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Going on.

575
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Be the best at everything you do.

576
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
In doing that, one, put everyone else before yourself.

577
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Push away compliments, shift them to your peers and your men, accept responsibility of failure and shortfalls only.

578
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.000
For an in them is the improvement and growth.

579
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
So this is actually a conversation we had on one of our earlier podcasts.

580
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Any compliments, success, you shift that to your peers and your men, you're accepted responsibility for the failures and the shortfalls.

581
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And again, if you don't accept the responsibility for those failures and shortfalls, how are they ever going to get fixed?

582
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:57.000
If you don't accept the responsibility for your peers and your peers and your peers, you shift them to responsibility for failure and

583
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
success.

584
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I never going to change everything.

585
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Anything.

586
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
If it's all echo's fault.

587
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
I did everything right.

588
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
It's all echo's fault.

589
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:21.000
For what is right and wrong, for what a good seal and a bad one is, for what makes an exceptional leader and a horrible one.

590
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000
You must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction.

591
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:37.000
In my point with this was that I think in his mind, his vision of what a quote unquote good seal was.

592
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
I think he thought he was being it.

593
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And I had to explain to him that he was wrong.

594
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
He did not understand what a good seal was.

595
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
He did not understand what an exceptional leader was.

596
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
He just did not understand it.

597
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:04.000
You must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction.

598
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:12.000
The final corrective measure.

599
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Lose your ego.

600
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:23.000
This guy despite having a treacherous record and a horrible reputation.

601
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Despite that for some unknown reason that I cannot fathom.

602
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
He had a big ego.

603
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
He thought he was a great seal.

604
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
He thought because he was a big dude and could shoot well.

605
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
He was a talented athlete as well.

606
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
But he thought that that made him a good seal.

607
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
And it didn't.

608
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
It just gave him a big ego.

609
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:58.000
So now I tell him, these are tall tasks, but you control them all.

610
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And that's true if you look at every one of those things.

611
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Be humble.

612
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Yes, he controls that.

613
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Except the fact that he needs some serious work.

614
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Yes, he controls that.

615
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Understand that the criticism is coming from a bunch of people not just me.

616
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Yes, that's under his control.

617
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Embracing contemplate the soul responsibility of being a seal officer about to lead men into battle.

618
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And possibly to their deaths.

619
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Yes, he controls that ability.

620
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Be the best at everything you do.

621
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Yes, that's under his control.

622
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
And this thing's, lose your ego.

623
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.000
These are all things that he had control over.

624
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
We need good aggressive leaders in the seal teams.

625
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
We don't need the person that I outlined above.

626
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000
And the reason I pointed that out is because I think in this guy's mind, he was an aggressive guy.

627
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And he was a good leader in his mind.

628
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
And I wanted him to know that yes, we do need aggressive leaders in the seal team.

629
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
But we don't need this guy.

630
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000
We don't need the guy that I'm just talking about.

631
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
It's in your hands.

632
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Good luck.

633
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Then I asked him, do you have any questions or comments for me?

634
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
Which he did not.

635
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
I asked him, are you sure?

636
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
He was sure.

637
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I asked him if he understood.

638
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And he nodded his head.

639
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And again, the reason I'm reading these is because these are my actual notes.

640
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:28.000
And then I said, do you believe I am right?

641
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Or do you just think I don't?

642
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Or do you think I just don't get it?

643
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000
And that you actually know what's up.

644
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
And he, of course, said, no, I understand.

645
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And even as he was saying those words,

646
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
I was not convinced.

647
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
And this gentleman did not make it in his leadership role.

648
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
And he ended up getting fired.

649
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
When he said that he understands, was it like, was he all salty like,

650
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yeah, understand me?

651
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000
No, I mean, he was not, he was not openly disrespectful.

652
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:32.000
And maybe somewhere in his brain he was trying to understand and trying to listen and trying to believe.

653
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000
But it wasn't there.

654
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:46.000
So in going through this, and I think one of the reasons why I wanted to do this on the podcast was

655
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:54.000
a lot of times leadership is about awareness.

656
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And I use this example all the time in the movie Terminator.

657
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
It says, you know, in the year 2016, the machines became aware.

658
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And I used to get to see that with sea leaders like they become aware of being in a leadership position.

659
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And so that's the one form of awareness.

660
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000
And I think a lot of times you don't recognize, if you're not aware of something you can't recognize what the problem is.

661
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000
And so going through this, all these issues that this guy had,

662
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
I people that are listening to this podcast, you don't have all these issues.

663
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
It's impossible.

664
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
You wouldn't even like to listen to this podcast because this is a podcast where we're all kind of sitting here.

665
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Taking ourselves apart and seeing what we could do better and trying to learn and people with this type of attitude that this guy had.

666
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
They, they don't even enjoy this because they think they know everything.

667
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
You know, I'd even talk into them.

668
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
I'm not even talking to them.

669
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
But everybody myself included.

670
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
I still go through this and I go, I'm doing that a little bit right there.

671
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I'm falling into that trap.

672
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
I'm getting a little bit arrogant on this thing.

673
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
I'm doing this wrong.

674
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
I'm not, I'm not, I'm letting my emotions out too much.

675
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
And again, I'm not telling people to be robots.

676
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:33.000
But you can't be an emotional disaster or emotional show for your people.

677
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000
So that awareness and thinking about it.

678
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:49.000
And the other thing, this is the other reason why I wanted to use this particular note is because I think it's as direct of a note.

679
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I could write someone.

680
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Maybe I could do it better now.

681
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I don't know, but at the time to go face to face with someone and kind of call them out.

682
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
This is about as stern as I could do it.

683
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
And this is the standard that we need to hold ourselves to.

684
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:17.000
That sternness, that what am I doing wrong and how do I be honest with myself and be my own worst critic, which is a big cliche.

685
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
But yeah, be your own worst critic.

686
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Look at yourself and you can't be your own worst critic if you don't detach from the situation.

687
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
If you're inside your own head, you can't even critique yourself.

688
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
So you gotta get out of that brain.

689
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:36.000
And that's gonna be a common theme for not just for this show, not just for this podcast.

690
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
But forever.

691
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Because it's one of those things.

692
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:47.000
It's really helped me and I think has helped the people that I've worked with when they overcome that.

693
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
So there's some counseling for everybody myself included.

694
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
So now we are getting to the internet questions.

695
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000
So again, if you're listening to this podcast and you're wondering where these questions come from, they come from.

696
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
A couple different places on the internet, Facebook.

697
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
I actually get most of them from Twitter.

698
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
If you want to see what's happening on Twitter with me, it's at Jocca Willink.

699
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:26.000
If you want to see what's happening on Twitter with Echo, it's at Echo Charles.

700
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And if you want to see what's happening on there.

701
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
And also if you want to submit questions, then from me, Twitter's the place to do it.

702
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Because I can jump on there.

703
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
That means you have to be disciplined and keep your question short.

704
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:49.000
And I just drag those questions out of there and put them into the well of questions.

705
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:57.000
And with that, in some of my answer, you know, right there on the spot.

706
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
In some of them, I go, that's a good topic.

707
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:11.000
So with that in mind, and I'll tell you, this is still from the well of questions, where most of these, I don't have the name of the person because I'm still on the well of questions of the first time I asked them.

708
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
I got hundreds of questions. So I'm still going through those.

709
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
And here we go.

710
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000
What drill view to become an English major in college?

711
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
This is something I surprisingly get asked a lot.

712
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000
And I guess it shouldn't be that surprising because if you don't know my story with college, I was actually already in the seal teams.

713
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
I had spent ten years in the seal teams when I finally got sent to college.

714
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
I had to get a college degree in order to continue my career as a seal officer.

715
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
And when I went to college, it was not even a question that I was going to be an English major.

716
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
So why is that?

717
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Well, luckily, I had spent enough time in the seal teams to realize that the most important skill

718
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:03.000
from an officer perspective that could differentiate and make you do a better job of something you can,

719
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I mean, we talk about leadership all the time and the different points and humility and discipline, all those things that make you good leader.

720
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
That's great.

721
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
But those aren't things that you learn in college.

722
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.000
So which skill could I learn in college that will actually make me do a better job as a seal leader?

723
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And I knew before I even showed up there exactly what that was going to be and that was English.

724
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Why?

725
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Well, English to me was the study of the English language, the English language, is the methodology that we American humans use to communicate with each other.

726
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:55.000
And as a leader, it is critical that you have a good control and a good grip on this medium that you're going to use to communicate what your vision is.

727
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:05.000
What your ideas are, what your strategies are, what the orders are, you have to be able to do that in clear and concise language.

728
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:21.000
And I knew that English would provide me with that. You also have to be able to understand what you are being told to do or what the orders are, what the mission is or things like rules of engagement.

729
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:29.000
So rules of engagement is a legal document written by lawyers and you have to read it and understand it.

730
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:41.000
And I found that this was very, very useful. This was probably, and again, looking back, because you know what I guess I could have gotten to agree in history and I could have really drilled down with the knowledge, right?

731
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
And that would have been helpful as well.

732
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:51.000
But the practical application of English in that job was very important.

733
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:58.000
And I will tell you that in anyone that's going to have an leadership position, the command of the English language is a very important thing.

734
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And when I started to get into Shakespeare and Shakespeare, I know there's at least half the audience just went, oh God, what is he talking about Shakespeare?

735
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
The thing about Shakespeare is, and this is what I had to learn in college, when you first see Shakespeare, you think, oh, I don't understand this.

736
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:31.000
This is a bunch of gobbledy-gooke. This doesn't sound like English, I don't understand it. You're not supposed to understand it. And people don't pick up a Shakespeare play and just understand it.

737
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
You have to study what the words mean. The guy made up words.

738
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
He just made them up. So how could you know what it means? You're lying if you say it in order to mean. He made it up.

739
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:53.000
He used archaic words that words back then that weren't archaic, but they're archaic. Now people do not use them anymore. So how could you know what they mean? You don't have to look them up and figure out what they mean.

740
00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:04.000
And that was very good for me to take a bunch of Shakespeare and have to look at these, look at this writing and figure out what it all means.

741
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:15.000
So I realized that when three years later, four years later, when I got a rules of engagement that was written by a lawyer and there was words and there I didn't understand. I didn't just go, oh, God, I don't understand this and throw it away.

742
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000
No, I said, okay, there's a word in our stand. I just need to look it up, figure out what it means, make sense of it.

743
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:50.000
And that's what that's what studying Shakespeare specifically did for me. And you know at some point we're going to get in some Shakespeare right here and there's some very very powerful things that Shakespeare will which are unmatched in language in my opinion. So that's down the road probably not too far, but that is why I studied English in college.

744
00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:02.000
How do you deal with delayed onset muscle soreness or stiffness from weight training and how does it affect your jujitsu?

745
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The jujitsu questions.

746
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Awesome. So obviously I work out, I work out pretty much every day. I work out that means I lift weights, I do calisthenics, I do sprints, I do

747
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:37.000
some kind of physical conditioning every single day. And that means that yes, I am always at least somewhat sore and tired when I show up to train the jujitsu, which I usually do in the evenings.

748
01:00:37.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So for me, jujitsu always makes me feel better. You know, you're basically getting a very gnarly full body massage when you train jujitsu. You're getting a very aggressive and involuntary full body massage and you're getting stretched in different directions.

749
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So whenever you know if I did some exercise that made me sore, if I did dead lifts and I'm feeling sore, tied to my back and I go, do jujitsu by the time it's done, I don't feel that sore anymore.

750
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So just like a massage or a stretch, I think it loosens up and it's pretty normal for me. I also like to train sore and tired because it just makes training a little bit harder and makes you more ready.

751
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And all that being said when I do heavy squats or high repetition squats or any squats where I kind of push the envelope. Yeah, my legs are really sore and it sucks to get on the mat and I do it anyways.

752
01:01:43.000 --> 01:02:00.000
And also training while your muscles are sore when you're tired and it helps your technique. Right? So your knees just push as a bigger guy. Yeah, you know, having strength and weight at the same time is an advantage can be used as a weapon, but can get in the way of your technique.

753
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And you can get in the way of your progression. Yeah, for sure. You might be speaking from a standpoint of someone who's in good condition, by the way, because I would say that for most people, I would argue.

754
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:46.000
For most people, it's not a full body massage. It doesn't loosen you up. It makes you more sore. Yes, and you know what, that's a good point. And that beyond the fact, this is you actually are right on more points than you know, because beyond the fact that yes, I am in fairly good condition because I do work out every day. Also, jiu jitsu for me, because I am experienced is generally not a

755
01:02:46.000 --> 01:03:04.000
100% physical war, like you have when you're not quite as experienced. And if you watch, you know, when I'm rolling with guys on my training partners, they're all good guys too. So we're training for, you know, an hour.

756
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And we can do it. It's not because we're in that much better condition. It's just that we're that much more relaxed and we're lying more on technique. So that's a good point. And I can see we're in the early days. Now that being said, I trained this way the whole time that I've trained. So I'm even when I was a spaz crazy, you know, white belt warrior.

757
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I still worked out every day. And when I was a blue belt training super hard, I still worked out every day. So you're, I was going down the path that you were right, but now we're going to re-nake on that and say that you're on.

758
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
And you just need to work out, get on the mat, loosen it up and keep training.

759
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Well, yeah, I think in the grand scheme of things, you'd be more loose. Yeah, but we're talking about delayed onset muscle soreness. I think I think I would argue that most people after training,

760
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:07.000
due to it's too unless it is like just a light like roll, but if you're, you know, if you're doing just, I don't know, the normal due to it's a guy.

761
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Let's say he does four round six minutes, one minute in between.

762
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:19.000
He's going to get more delayed onset muscle soreness the next day from the due to it. I don't think so. I think so.

763
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:28.000
This is an issue that will not be solved on the Jockel podcast. I would say try it.

764
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Try it. That's what I'm saying. I think so because I've been trying it for years and years.

765
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
So it's another thing is every time you show up to due to Jitsu, it's not a competition day.

766
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You know, and not that you don't have rolls and good rolls and you go hard, but there is a difference between like, I want to let this guy pass my guard or I'm going to, I'm going to hang on with every little piece of my, and what does this look you're giving me right now?

767
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I agree with you, but it still doesn't change my argument that even if you're rolling that way, yeah, I think that you have to roll pretty light to not get any delayed onset muscle.

768
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Okay, here's one more story. And this is where you might be right. This is a funny story. So like I just talked about when I went to college. So when I went to college at the University of San Diego, it was, I was still in the military, but I was my job was to go to college, which meant that for somebody that was used to working 18 hours a day as a seal, all of a sudden I didn't have 18 hours day to work.

769
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So I trained a lot. And one of the things I noticed one day for whatever reason I had, I think I had one of my kids was born, and I had final exams or just some, some perfect storm of events.

770
01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And I missed, and I didn't train due to four, three days. And on the fourth day, I got up out of bed, and I felt all the like, young and I wasn't sore. And I just, I, I was staying. I feel great. What is this? And what it was was that I hadn't trained. And at that time, at that time, this is when Dean, Lister and I were training like madmen and he was constantly competing.

771
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And he was, and we would train for two to four hours a day of just cycle rolling. And, but again, even when we were doing cycle rolling like that, it wasn't competition day.

772
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And, but we, but it definitely made me sore. And so you, you get some soreness, you're correct.

773
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You're correct. I think I'm just used to being in a continued state of soreness.

774
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Yeah, that's what it is. So when you're like, oh yeah, I didn't roll for three days on that, you know, that, that fourth day you woke up and you're like dang, well, I feel young. What is this? That's called rest.

775
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You rested and you recovered. It happens. I mean, I mean, I'm going to travel now. And at the, in every day is obviously days when I don't get trained. But, um.

776
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Okay, so this question is, um, I don't know if it's an addition to the other question, but it's phrase like this. Also, I'd like to hear more about more about your writing process.

777
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Tough times, what worked well, creative breakthroughs, et cetera.

778
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I don't think these were related. I think this is just pulled out. So, alright, right? Okay.

779
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Creative breakthroughs.

780
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah. So first of all, if to go specifically on how I wrote this book and you could probably apply this to any kind of task that you're looking at doing.

781
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.000
But the first thing we did and lay for my wrote this book together, the first thing we did was we outlined the book and what the chapters were about.

782
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And what the stories inside the chapters. So we both knew what the chapter was.

783
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And then we said, uh, and, and if you haven't read the book, I wrote half the chapters and he wrote half the chapters. So we didn't.

784
01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:01.000
We didn't write it together and try and mind meld the whole thing. Now the intro, we wrote together in the outro or whatever it's called.

785
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We wrote it together. And that was cool. You know, we just edited it because it was both of us talking.

786
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:18.000
But we didn't have to try and mind meld or or come to a agreement on the rest of it. We just wrote separate chapters. And so what I did was once we once we knew what the chapters were, once we knew what they were going to be about.

787
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Then I wrote a thousand words a day no matter what that was my.

788
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I was very busy at the time. I was doing some big contracts. I was super busy.

789
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:41.000
And I knew that I had to do it in chunks. And I also know that my attention span is I can force it, but it's not fun.

790
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
So a thousand words took me about an hour like 50 minutes to an hour. So every day no matter what I sat down.

791
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And I ended up writing about 60,000 words. So it took me, no, I think it was 55,000 words took me 55 days 55 days straight. And my draft was done.

792
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And that's that's there's a couple of good advantages to it. Number one when you write every day. If you write if you skip two days and then you go back, guess what you've got to go back and reread what you wrote because you don't remember it.

793
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Whereas if you just go back into it, I could just pick up where I left off boom, I could start writing again an hour later. I'm done.

794
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I have to go back and reread. I know what my train of thought was. So that was important. And sometimes I didn't feel like writing of course, but I just wrote anyways.

795
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And sometimes it would come out not that great, but it doesn't matter. You've got a thousand words that you can hone and you can adjust and you can turn it into something good.

796
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And also, it just takes away every excuse is gone. There's no excuse. There's no excuse. There's no excuse. There's only you do what you're supposed to do. That's the only thing. Not I'm don't know what to think. I'm I lost my train of thought. I have writers block or whatever.

797
01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I'm too tired. No, it's like one answer for all these problems. And that is right. So you got writers block good right you got I'm too tired. I had a long day good right. Oh, I'm stuck and I don't know where to take this story. Good right. That's the only it's just one answer solved every problems.

798
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And that's kind of the same thing with with everything, you know, with going to the gym. You know what? I'm tired. Good. Go workout. I'm sore. Good. Go workout. I'm super busy right now. Good. Go workout.

799
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And you could do this. You could apply this to any sort of, you know, with training you get to. I don't know if I'm I'm not feeling like my A game tonight. Good. Go train when you're weak.

800
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Good. Go train when you're mentally not not there because it doesn't matter. What is it? Is it the world championships today? And even if it is the world championship, you gotta go fight anyways because the world championships.

801
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Get on the mat and train. Yeah, and you could you can look at these when you say that that applies to everything. I can't feel like it or whatever. A lot of times create like creative block.

802
01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And I'm just realizing right when you said that is the visa first time I'm kind of understanding this and realizing that. Okay, when you have a creative block that's almost like.

803
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:13.000
In my experience it's a good reason to not do creative stuff because I can't because creativity comes from a real like you have to feel it. You have to want to do it. It's like a creative thing, right?

804
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
In Sparado. Yeah, or you cannot manufacture in Sparado. Yeah.

805
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Whoa, tenacious D. Yeah, you can't. You can't manufacture it. Whatever. It's probably. So you know, it's different than point to each end. So are you saying, though, if you get creative block and philosophy that I don't know echo does.

806
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:46.000
He writes and produces and films and directs videos of all kinds. So you're saying when you can't think of what to write you just stop. Yes.

807
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
We have a career in our best. You know, in a way that I'm saying.

808
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000
But what I'm saying is and that's okay. I mean, we all different techniques. My technique is not better than your technique. Your technique may work sometimes.

809
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:04.000
It may be work a hundred percent for you. I'm talking about my technique and my technique was like, okay, I've got writers blocking it or where to go with this. I'm going to write any.

810
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And what you're saying is when that happens to you, you say, you know what, I'm just going to walk away from it right now and come back to it later.

811
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000
And that's okay. I said until right now, though, I just realize it when you said, okay, if you don't feel like writing or good do it anyway, because

812
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I guess I never really thought past that because when you say, yeah, you'll just have more stuff to hone into, okay, if later on when you do hit inspiration, which now you have more material to draw inspiration from.

813
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.000
It's going to come clear like, okay, that thing that I wrote or, you know, put it in when I wasn't inspired.

814
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Okay, that's got to go, but you can learn so much from what you put down there. Why doesn't that work or dang, that was pretty good when I was feeling bored when I was feeling whatever that's pretty good. I'm going to use that, you know, so you're going to you're going to get way more results potentially than you would if you simply don't do anything and what if the inspiration doesn't come back, which it's

815
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:11.000
okay, it doesn't. A lot of the time. Then it's too late, so yeah, good lesson learned right there. Thanks. That is a good one. So next question from Jennifer.

816
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:19.000
From Jennifer. This one I guess that I'm there. That has a name nice Jennifer Jennifer says I'm really struggling with focus lately.

817
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I'd love for you to cover it on the podcast focus cover that. This is, do we get asked this a lot about focus? I don't know if we've got to ask specifically.

818
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yeah, it's basically about focus but this is one of those things and this is, this is I'm starting to realize a underlying theme with a lot of with a lot of what people are asking me and

819
01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:00.000
that is I think people have a vision or a thought that I've got some answer that is like, oh, you lack focus. Follow steps one, two and three.

820
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:09.000
I've talked about this leadership and then I've got some easy button solution for these situations.

821
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:20.000
And this got me thinking about my kids and one of my daughters who, when she was, I don't know what, how old you are when you're supposed to learn the time is tables,

822
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.000
which she was that age and she got really disappointed because she didn't know our time's tables.

823
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000
She would actually, you're young when I get, again, I don't, I forget that grade, but it's, you know, it's like maybe second grade second third grade.

824
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Second third grade. So she's supposed to know her times that tables. She doesn't know him and she starts getting this, this negative attitude of, I'm stupid, you know, I'm dumb, other kids know him.

825
01:14:48.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I don't know him and I just said, oh, well, have you studied him and she hadn't, she hadn't studied him, she'd sat in class when they would go over them and she'd picked up 50 or 60 or maybe even 70% of them.

826
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But you know, there's some hard ones in there, right? 12 times 12.

827
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
12 times 12 is a tough one.

828
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:26.000
You know there's some tricky ones in there that she didn't know and so I said, oh, well, you need to study him and then you'll know them. So, you know, we made the flashcards and she studied them and obviously she knew him and then she realized that you have to practice these things and you have to put effort into them.

829
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And to same thing with sports, you know, you'll get the kids that says, I'm not any good at baseball. We, you don't spend any time practicing it.

830
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And so it's the same thing with focus. You, it takes effort. You just don't, I don't wake up in the morning, flip a switch and then become focus when I was writing when I was just talking about writing this book that we wrote.

831
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I didn't go, okay, flip the switch for focus. I'm going to do a thousand words right now. No, no, I didn't, I didn't sit down and go, okay, listen, idiot. This is your job.

832
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:06.000
You need to do it. Get it done. You know, another funny story is in the seal teams. We have these helmets. We had them. We've modified them since.

833
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
But we had these helmets and underneath the helmets you would wear this, this headset that your radio headphones would go into.

834
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
So when you're in the seal teams, you're out on the battlefield. You got to talk to different people and you've got to have a radio and you've got nice.

835
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Almost, I guess it would be to describe it. It's like a Bose noise canceling headset for all practical purposes, but it's durable.

836
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And you wear that underneath your helmet. And if you're in a leadership position, sometimes you have one group of people talking into one year and the other one might be the air frequency. So you can hear the aircraft talking. So you got all the stuff going on inside your head.

837
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And that's tricky and kind of a pain. But what was really painful was the way they made these headsets, they didn't fit right.

838
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So they were very painful and they actually squeezed your head. So when you put your head set on and then you put your helmet on over it and it actually squeezed your head.

839
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And it was very, very uncomfortable. Give you a headache. It just wasn't fun at all. It sucked.

840
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:29.000
So we were out on this training mission. And this is when I was a task unit commander. And it was a long one. It was you know, 14 hours. We were out there on this target and we were securing it and we were holding it and we were searching it and doing all this stuff and took a long time.

841
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And about eight hours into it. One of the junior officers came up to me and he says, if you kept your helmet on this whole time.

842
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And I said, yes, he said, doesn't it hurt a lot? And I said, yes.

843
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And that was it. You know, there was just pain to be experienced and I just sucked it up and eventually we figured out how to how to cure it. But the point is, is that does it take some pain to focus?

844
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yes, it is not easy. There's it takes will and it takes mental effort to make it happen. You know, and it's there we get into kind of the things I think I talked about this last week, but you know, shut off the music.

845
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Set a goal for what you're trying to get done and then put a time limit on it. You know, I used to raise myself when I was right in those words, you know, I'd race and see how fast I could get them done.

846
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:34.000
And then go and that's that that's your focus. Your focus is something that you control and you can make happen. So get focused.

847
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Practice focusing. Practice focusing. Yeah, because you kind of at first glance or the first thought isn't that you practice focusing.

848
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000
You focus on practicing or you focus on writing or you focus on, you know, and if you can't focus, like, dang, that sucks.

849
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But if you practice focusing, then you can focus on your writing and all.

850
01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And also everybody knows that the deadlines make you more focused when something's due. I mean, so put a deadline on yourself and make it real somehow.

851
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Right, like kind of like, if someone texts you say, hey, I'll be over in 10 minutes.

852
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000
You can clean your house pretty quick in that 10 minutes. You can have me. But if you're still for three hours to clean, it's going to take three hours.

853
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It's probably take three hours.

854
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Yeah, life and I say when when people would to plan for an operation, how long does it take to plan for an operation?

855
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:34.000
We would always say a half an hour longer than you have. That's how long it takes. So just get on it, start planning it and go forward.

856
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Oh, so diet, what do you eat? And any thoughts on using superfood, amaranth?

857
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
To increase fuel nutrition?

858
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Amaranth, do you know what amaranth is?

859
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
No. I didn't know what it was either. I didn't know you looked.

860
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
I looked it up.

861
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I'm going to change the look and things up.

862
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
What is it?

863
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Fruit.

864
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It's some kind of a grain, some kind of a grain.

865
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
So what do I insure? I guess you'd classify me as a paleo type person.

866
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I stake. I chicken. I pork.

867
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I actually for whatever reason, and don't like the taste of fish and seafood that much or eggs, which is really unfortunate.

868
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Yeah, I know. It's really bizarre.

869
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I ate a lot of hamburgers growing up, and I kind of didn't need a lot of seafood growing up, so I just did not have a big fan.

870
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
So I eat a lot of steak, chicken pork.

871
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I eat some kind of salad, you know, just about every day.

872
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I love Caesar salad, so I eat a lot of that spinach salad.

873
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I put a lot of olive oil on it, kind of baited.

874
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:44.000
This is Peter Atia, who's a really smart doctor.

875
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And I guess the president and CEO of something called New See, which is this nutrition science, which is this large,

876
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
the biggest organization to study nutrition.

877
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And he gave me a good thought, or the way he explained these salads, you know, he looked at salads as a vehicle to eat fat,

878
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
by just putting a ton of olive oil, basically.

879
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.000
So I've gotten into that lately, and just really making these big salads with massive amounts of olive oil so I can get plenty of fat.

880
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
So I'm definitely a fan of eating as much fat as possible.

881
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:37.000
You know, if you want to talk about why I do that, if you, you know, there's a book called Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Tombs, which is a fantastic book, and gives a lot of background on it.

882
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Like I said, Peter Atia, who's just a brilliant guy who I've had a lot of great long conversations with because we've done some stuff together.

883
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
And he's actually the person that introduced me to Tim Ferriss.

884
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I mentioned that on the first podcast, but it's funny.

885
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
He's been a good person for dinner, and he wants to know about seal stuff.

886
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000
But I just want about nutrition stuff and his take on nutrition stuff, so that we have good conversations and good trade-offs.

887
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But he will, you know, he explains a lot of stuff really well.

888
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And then another good thing, on the Tim Ferriss podcast, he did an interview with Dom Dagestino, who's got a really good perspective, another doctor that's, you know, a workout guy,

889
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
and understanding nutrition very well.

890
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So that's where I have gotten to in my life, and I've got a long story, you know, about nutrition and maybe someday we can go into it.

891
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It's just the discovery, and it's just with everyone else.

892
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I mean, just the fact that I guess 20 something 25 years ago, everyone fought, well not everyone, but most people fought, fat was bad, and carbs were good.

893
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
That's not true. Actually, carbs are bad, and fat is good.

894
01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So it's been a, it's been a, and I was lucky to have been around people that knew that early and taught the information to me.

895
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So that's, that's the, in a nutshell, and if you want to get with the experts, then people like Garantoms, people like Peter at the, people like Dom Dagestino, they're the ones that,

896
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
you know, can give you the science behind what I'm talking about or what I've experienced as well.

897
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Nutrition. Nutrition is also one of those subjects that, you know, people vehemally disagree with each other on.

898
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:36.000
There was a while where I was banned by my wife from talking about nutrition with her friends.

899
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Early days of me being completely pro fat and pro protein and really anti-carbohydrates when no one really thought that, you know, 10 years ago, and I would be giving all of her friends a hard time about what they were reading and what they were feeding their kids and my wife eventually banned me because I was problematic in the situation.

900
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah, I mean, even just saying, you know, carbs are bad. I mean, there's a lot to that, you know, but to say, carbs are bad. That's a controversial thing.

901
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Exactly. Yeah. And this is another thing, and I keep saying this, but I'm not, I'm not here to convince anybody.

902
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And if you want to tell me that carbs are great, good for you, you know, I hope you enjoy type two diabetes, get after it.

903
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.000
But but it's not like carbs get CC what you're doing right now. You're going to start a little argument right now.

904
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:41.000
No, I'm not going to, okay. But because the bottom line is I don't this is stuff that I have figured out.

905
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I've learned from people. I've used it myself and I know what works for me. And if you don't want to believe that, I'm okay with that.

906
01:24:49.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I'm not here to save your life. I'm not here to change your mind, you know, and it's the same thing. You know, you've heard me say this about Gigiitsu, where I used to be really, you know, no, Gigiitsu is better than this and Gigiitsu is better than that. Now I'm, like, no, actually there's other, and first of all, there's other perspectives,

907
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
but also that are correct. And Gigiitsu and I actually believe that Gigiitsu, I actually believe need be well rounded and all the other stuff, but

908
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:21.000
the bottom line is I'm not a, I'm not a here to convert people, but somebody asked what I ate and I told them.

909
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Right. That's, that's technically that is 100% true. That's what I did.

910
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And if you want to argue those points, don't argue with me. Are you with Peter at the, are you with Gary Tobs?

911
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Are you with Dom, Dagestine, because those guys are, I mean, Peter and Dom are scientists and doctors, so they know and they will give you the facts, which I could give you, but I won't be doing nearly as convincing.

912
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not coming.

913
01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Okay. Next question. A couple of guys, I'd like to hear your thoughts on Richard Mark, Chinkle, Marcinko, Marcinko, and Henry Romans.

914
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So let's start off with Dick Marcinko, demo Dick Marcinko, who, if you don't know who that is, he was a seal in Vietnam, a seal officer in Vietnam.

915
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:39.000
He was the founder of seal team six. He created seal team six. He ended up getting in trouble with the Navy and they kind of did a witch hunt on him.

916
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And he was eventually, I don't, actually, he did. He did a little bit of jail time. They found that he had falsified some travel records and maybe to money, but they found stuff on him.

917
01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:12.000
But it was kind of trivial stuff that was trumped up. But in a forced amount of the military and he wrote a book in the early 90s, because it showed up in the seal teams right around when I got actually through buzz and in the seal team.

918
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:31.76
So it was sometime around 1991. He wrote a book called Rogue Warrior and it did amazing. Well, sold a lot of copies and it was definitely broke the mold of this idea of the quiet professional, which was how I was

919
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:49.76
most certainly raised in the seal teams. And it's something that I've obviously contradicted now because Rogue a book with Lave have this podcast I've been on TV. So I've definitely broke the paradigm of the quiet professional.

920
01:27:49.76 --> 01:28:12.76
And I'm not, you know, even if you the book that Lave and I wrote isn't a book about our triumphs and everything we did great, it's a book about what we learned, usually from bad situations and humbling experience.

921
01:28:12.76 --> 01:28:23.76
And it's an effort to pass on leadership lessons learned that we learned in a humbling way. So there's that.

922
01:28:23.76 --> 01:28:41.76
But Richard Marcinko from my perspective in the seal teams, and again, this was right when I came in, he was kind of the guy that broke this mold. And of course, there's been, you know, dozens and dozens of quote unquote seal books now.

923
01:28:41.76 --> 01:28:57.76
But he was the first one very well received and definitely got some flack from the seal community. And that is what it is. Now now I worked for guys that worked for him.

924
01:28:57.76 --> 01:29:13.76
That literally, or, you know, he was their commanding officer. And I remember one of them, I said to this one senior guy that was had been ton of experience and I said, you know, you worked for Marcinko.

925
01:29:13.76 --> 01:29:34.76
Well, how was he? And he looked at me with a no hesitation said best commanding officer I ever had. And that's I heard that everybody ever asked just about told me that the only people that you'd hear anything different from would be senior senior officers that he was, you know, he'd be over the top.

926
01:29:34.76 --> 01:29:47.76
He wasn't, he didn't quite play the game. And but there's no doubt about it. He was a tough guy. He was a hard-core guy. And the guys that worked for him, respected him and liked him.

927
01:29:47.76 --> 01:30:12.76
The thing that I learned from him was seeing how that transition took place and how he, the thing that got him to where he was to to get that responsibility of creating seal team six, which is this elite counterterrorist part of the Navy.

928
01:30:12.76 --> 01:30:28.76
Obviously he was trusted and he was liked and he was respected. And so I saw that he had gotten himself to that level, which is very cool.

929
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:43.76
But I also saw and I, again, this is a topic that comes up a lot. Our strengths are often our biggest weaknesses. And so this kind of cowboy mentality, this aggressive mentality that he had.

930
01:30:43.76 --> 01:31:06.76
It got him there, but once he got there, it doesn't seem like he was able to reign that back in. And that is something that I became cognizant of because no doubt when I was a younger guy when I was a young seal and then a young seal officer, I was definitely fairly cowboyish.

931
01:31:06.76 --> 01:31:17.76
As I moved up the ranks, I recognized that I had to mature and I had to grow up and I had to do things differently. I couldn't do the same things.

932
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:39.76
That day when I was a young platoon guy, as I could, I had to tighten it up when I became a young officer and then I became a platoon commander and then I became a task commander and I had to grow up, you know, for lack of a better word. And looking back, I should have grown up even more, you know, but you don't see that at the time.

933
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:49.76
Something that I learned from Marcenko, even though I never worked for him and I met him on handful of times, you know, but never spent any actual time with him.

934
01:31:49.76 --> 01:32:03.76
But I have also seen this exact same thing with business leaders, with CEOs, especially with CEOs that come into a company that is not doing well.

935
01:32:03.76 --> 01:32:11.76
And there's only one kind of person that can turn that company around. Somebody with a dynamic personality, somewhere with a vision, someone that's going to kick down door, somebody's going to make things happen.

936
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:16.76
And you see those guys going there and they get that done and they turn those companies around.

937
01:32:16.76 --> 01:32:32.76
And then the real test comes, is can they transition from being that cowboy to being that company person to being that straight shooter straight in arrow that takes the company then from survival to thrive.

938
01:32:32.76 --> 01:32:47.76
And some of them make it and some of them don't. And I look at Dick Marcenko as a cautionary tale to everybody that comes up through the ranks and gets to that point where you need to take it to the next level.

939
01:32:47.76 --> 01:32:56.76
And how you have to change what got you there is not going to be what keeps you there. You have to change and you have to adapt and grow.

940
01:32:56.76 --> 01:33:09.76
And so I think that's important to recognize and it's important to constantly be looking around for examples and saying, okay, I saw what happened there and try and push yourself forward.

941
01:33:09.76 --> 01:33:15.76
So that's that's my, I don't want to say my opinion because it's not really my opinion.

942
01:33:15.76 --> 01:33:27.76
That's those are my thoughts on demo Dick Marcenko, the rogue warrior. The other one is Henry Rollins.

943
01:33:27.76 --> 01:33:44.76
And if you don't know who Henry Rollins is he was a young kid from the DC area who grew up in the punk rock scene in DC went to a military action.

944
01:33:44.76 --> 01:33:47.76
Went to a military academy.

945
01:33:47.76 --> 01:33:52.76
And eventually even though he was kind of just a kid.

946
01:33:52.76 --> 01:34:01.76
At some point a band called Black Flag who was an incredible band led by a guitarist named Greg again.

947
01:34:01.76 --> 01:34:12.76
They asked Rollins who was just a fan who had jumped on the stage at some point and sang one of their songs. They said, hey, they had a falling out or I figured what happened with their first singer.

948
01:34:12.76 --> 01:34:21.76
But the first singer wasn't singing anymore if they needed a new singer they asked Rollins to try out. Rollins jumped on the opportunity and took that gig.

949
01:34:21.76 --> 01:34:34.76
And ended up being the lead singer of the band Black Flag who is a really pivotal band in American rock and roll.

950
01:34:34.76 --> 01:34:43.76
And I think he took Black Flag to a whole new level and I've talked about talking about this on Tim Ferriss and I'll talk about it again.

951
01:34:43.76 --> 01:34:50.76
But there was an album called Black Flag My War, which is an incredible album.

952
01:34:50.76 --> 01:35:00.76
And it's especially an incredible album. And if for those of you that listen to those of you young ones out there, the record used to come on a piece of vinyl.

953
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:14.76
And there was two sides to it. And so the this Black Flag album called My War had two sides to it. The first side sounded fairly similar to what most of Black Flag sounded like prior to that, which is just sort of punk rock fast beat.

954
01:35:14.76 --> 01:35:30.76
Whatever. Side two was this slow down heavy, dreadaging powerful music and the whole side is like that.

955
01:35:30.76 --> 01:35:38.76
And that side of that album was on my record player when I was 13 or 14 years old for like a year.

956
01:35:38.76 --> 01:35:56.76
And it's all I listen to and I really related to it because it just was something that this heavy, this introspective, this, this aggression and anger was something that I wouldn't when I heard it for the first time.

957
01:35:56.76 --> 01:36:02.76
I was like, oh, that's what I think that's what my mind is filled with.

958
01:36:02.76 --> 01:36:13.76
And this was sort of my the next thing that came after Black Sabbath for me because Black Sabbath is the first thing is that, okay, that's what I, that's a heavy and that's dark and I understand I relate to that.

959
01:36:13.76 --> 01:36:18.76
The happy music that I was hearing, I didn't understand that. I didn't relate to it.

960
01:36:18.76 --> 01:36:32.76
That heavy stuff when I heard that, this dark stuff, I related to it and I understood it and it fueled me. And so, Rollins, Black Flag, my war, side two, definitely had a big impact on me.

961
01:36:32.76 --> 01:36:46.76
And then from there, eventually he was out of Black Flag and he formed his own band and they made an epic record, which is called lifetime.

962
01:36:46.76 --> 01:37:01.76
Just again, this, this hit me at an age where, uh, what was I 16? And here comes this album called lifetime that was very powerful.

963
01:37:01.76 --> 01:37:18.76
Very raw, very hard. And it just, I can't imagine a better sound coming into my ears when I was 15 or 16 years old than this album lifetime. So myself and my buddies at the time, we were listening to Rollins.

964
01:37:18.76 --> 01:37:27.76
And again, this was, these were songs about power, these were songs about as a matter of fact, the cover of the lifetime album was two hands gripping the earth.

965
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:43.76
And it was, you know, this kind of this message of at least that's how I interpreted. That's the theater member. I was a kid and I'm hearing this stuff. And I'm overlaying what my thoughts of the world are on top of it. It sounded aggressive to me.

966
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:56.76
It sounded tough to me. And that's what my mind was like at the time. And so I put what I wanted it to, I made it what I wanted it to be. And to me, two hands holding the earth was a powerful symbol of, I'm going to do it.

967
01:37:56.76 --> 01:38:02.76
I'm going to take over the world. I'm going to control the world. I'm going to make things happen.

968
01:38:02.76 --> 01:38:20.76
So we actually, when I was a kid, we actually followed Rollins around. We would, you know, he played. This was in, I'm not saying this was like 88 or 89, but myself and my buddies who we were all on Rollins.

969
01:38:20.76 --> 01:38:32.76
And we went and buy a song play 10 or 15 times on the Eastern Seaboard. Maybe it wasn't 10, maybe it was 10 times. And we, you know, this is back in the day. This is, you know, he's playing clubs that are the signs of your living room.

970
01:38:32.76 --> 01:38:40.76
You know, you're, and we'd help him on load their instruments and we'd help him off load and we'd hang out with him afterwards. And it was, it was great. It was cool.

971
01:38:40.76 --> 01:38:52.76
And that was my experience. And I was definitely, I think that had a big impact on me. Another thing I had mentioned this about light, that album lifetime in between the songs.

972
01:38:52.76 --> 01:38:59.76
You know, if you look at vinyl records and there's a space in between the songs.

973
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:05.76
And there's, you know, there's like a standard, I don't know what, you know, there's a standard of two millimeters, let's say.

974
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:19.76
And when I first got that lifetime record, this space in between the songs, you could see it was, it was tiny. And that's because the, the one song would end in boom, the other song after a moment of sounds boom, the next song would kick in.

975
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:33.76
And that's what the album was like this intense, just driving, getting after it. So we would go to those shows and we would just go completely nuts and get our insane, mosh pit destruction on.

976
01:39:33.76 --> 01:39:43.76
So out of that, you know, spawned this, and the other thing was cool, the, you know, wrongs was, you know, we were not drinking, we were not at drugs and either was wrongs.

977
01:39:43.76 --> 01:39:53.76
So he was this kind of, you know, we'd see wrongs doing pushups before the shows. We'd say, oh yeah, this, this guy's like, oh, so you know, this, I relate to this guy, because I want to be strong.

978
01:39:53.76 --> 01:40:05.76
I don't want to do drugs and I'm staying clean and he's staying clean and so we had this good thing going, but again, this is my 15 year old brain.

979
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:18.76
And so what happens? So I took all that to mean that's the way life is. For instance, Rollins has a big tattoo on his back.

980
01:40:18.76 --> 01:40:36.76
And he says search and destroy. Okay. I took that literally, you know, okay, this, I need to search and destroy. How do you do that? Okay. What is the most hardcore thing? What is the most physical thing? What is how do you get control? How do you do? How do you be aggressive in the end degree? You know how you do it? You be a commando.

981
01:40:36.76 --> 01:40:55.76
So so those, again, those weird twisted interpretations of my mind said to me, okay, that means you need to be a commando. And that's what I did. That's how I did. That's one of the, I would say one of those factors that led me on the path that I'm, that I'm here today.

982
01:40:55.76 --> 01:41:14.76
So went through seal training and actually interestingly, the first Lala Palusa tour. And we'd have to Google this and see when this was, but it was the first Lala Palusa and Rollins was playing and they played down in somewhere in San Diego. Lala Palusa came and I went.

983
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:25.76
And I didn't want to pay for it for whatever reason. So I went backstage and I waited until I saw Rollins. And I saw Rollins and I said, Hey, Rollins.

984
01:41:25.76 --> 01:41:34.76
And he said, Hey, and you could see he kind of recognized me. I mean, he recognized me went over set high and I said, Hey, can you give me another show?

985
01:41:34.76 --> 01:41:55.76
And I got a couple of buddies with me and he said, it'd be easier to get you into Fort Knox. It was kind of weird because back in the day, we would sit there and hang out with them and help him load his van and get walk right in and it was just really cool to have that much interaction with somebody that you were into. I mean, you can't do that normally.

986
01:41:55.76 --> 01:42:11.76
And all of a sudden, there it was. Now he's in Lala Palusa and even though he's on tour and he's no anybody there, there's a guy there, me and I can't get in. So it was, you know, it's cool.

987
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:26.76
But it was definitely a sign to me that that things were a little different now and he had kind of made it right. I guess he made it now. And he ended up having some pretty big or he had some bigger records that did better than than lifetime.

988
01:42:26.76 --> 01:42:46.76
But the way it kind of continues, the way this story continues is that Rollins was a guy when I was a kid that talked about Vietnam vets. And if you read any of his news or reused a right books and I'd read his books and

989
01:42:46.76 --> 01:43:04.76
you talk about Vietnam vets now, this guy taught him so much about discipline and then he talked about he had this tattoo, this search and destroy and in his books or in his shows, he would talk about the violence and the fights and all these things and he even talked about like missions.

990
01:43:04.76 --> 01:43:17.86
The information just makes it still strong and itidge his works. But its like a kind of famous fiction comic from a song from a Han River cultured Hey Dureen P.

991
01:43:17.86 --> 01:43:28.26
when I was 14. And then I actually went and I did this stuff. You know, I actually went

992
01:43:28.26 --> 01:43:34.66
and did this stuff that he had talked about and that he spent his career talking about.

993
01:43:34.66 --> 01:43:43.70
And so all of a sudden this connection, this sort of, yeah, this connection that I had

994
01:43:43.70 --> 01:43:49.70
with him, all of a sudden it kind of faded because I looked at it from a different light.

995
01:43:49.70 --> 01:43:57.38
As it was no longer me looking at someone thinking this guy's done this cool stuff.

996
01:43:58.10 --> 01:44:02.42
It was actually starting to look at him thinking he didn't do this cool stuff.

997
01:44:04.90 --> 01:44:09.54
And now I think when I see him now, and it's weird, I think he's about 10 years older than me.

998
01:44:09.54 --> 01:44:18.82
Maybe 12 years older than me. So he, I can kind of see, it's a little bit of a glimpse in the future,

999
01:44:18.82 --> 01:44:22.82
you know, because you see a guy that's certain years older than you. And you know what he looked

1000
01:44:22.82 --> 01:44:28.90
like when he was 25 and you know what he looked like when he was 35 and 45 and now he's probably

1001
01:44:28.90 --> 01:44:35.70
55. And I can see what he looks like and what he did look like. So I kind of, I see him now and he

1002
01:44:35.70 --> 01:44:44.42
seems to be a result of that life that he ended up with, which is Hollywood and kind of famous

1003
01:44:44.42 --> 01:44:53.46
and kind of being in movies and being rock star. And it's, I don't have the same,

1004
01:44:55.14 --> 01:45:01.06
like I said, connection that I, that I did. But like I said, when I was a kid,

1005
01:45:01.06 --> 01:45:06.90
when I was 13 years old, when I was 14 years old, when I was 15 years old, I was, I was definitely,

1006
01:45:08.58 --> 01:45:16.50
I definitely took some things from him and applied him to my life. And I loved to meet up with

1007
01:45:16.50 --> 01:45:20.90
I know he loves up an LA and if it's on point, Hank, if you're listening, let me know. Let's

1008
01:45:20.90 --> 01:45:29.30
let's like up. We'll talk about the old times. But you know, I think that might even be something

1009
01:45:29.30 --> 01:45:43.38
the close with is when, when you're dealing with people, people are not who you want them to be.

1010
01:45:45.14 --> 01:45:50.18
Your idols, the people that look, you look up to the people that you think are cool, they're not,

1011
01:45:50.18 --> 01:45:58.10
they're not that person, kill your idols. Now, there's things that we can learn from people,

1012
01:45:59.38 --> 01:46:05.54
but they aren't going to be what you think they are. And they are going to be even what they should be.

1013
01:46:07.46 --> 01:46:10.34
Those, those people when you take him and you put him on a pedestal,

1014
01:46:11.94 --> 01:46:16.74
they're not deserving of that pedestal. They're going to be fault that they're going to be weak. They're

1015
01:46:16.74 --> 01:46:23.62
going to be ego maniacal. They're going to be condescending. They're going to be all those negative things

1016
01:46:23.62 --> 01:46:28.34
to be lazy. They're going to be entitled. They're going to be short-sighted. They're not going to be perfect

1017
01:46:30.34 --> 01:46:37.30
far from it. And that's fine. That's okay. You learn from their weaknesses.

1018
01:46:38.42 --> 01:46:43.30
And you learn from their strengths, of course, and you mimic them and you emulate them.

1019
01:46:43.30 --> 01:46:51.38
But equally is important. You learn from their faults. And you see, what not to do.

1020
01:46:53.54 --> 01:47:02.98
Because a bottom line is, you can't control other people. I know we spent time tonight talking

1021
01:47:02.98 --> 01:47:12.58
about manipulation and influence, but the bottom line is, you can't control. You can't make

1022
01:47:12.58 --> 01:47:23.70
people be what you want them to be. The only person that you can control is you.

1023
01:47:26.10 --> 01:47:32.10
You. And that's what you've got to focus on. Focus on you.

1024
01:47:32.10 --> 01:47:44.74
Focus on focus on making yourself who you want to be faster, smart, stronger, more humble.

1025
01:47:44.74 --> 01:47:54.58
Less ego. Discipline your body so you can free your mind. Get up early and go, get after it

1026
01:47:54.58 --> 01:48:05.06
and be that person that you want to be. And that's not easy and not everyone can do it.

1027
01:48:05.06 --> 01:48:14.50
And I'm not here to tell everybody that everybody can do it. But it can happen. And it does happen

1028
01:48:14.50 --> 01:48:28.98
through one small decision at a time and every one of those decisions important in building you.

1029
01:48:35.14 --> 01:48:40.66
And that's all I've got for today. So everyone out there,

1030
