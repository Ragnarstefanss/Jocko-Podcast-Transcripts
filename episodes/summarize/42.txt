He was like actually surprised like when you finally told me you know you like man, you know I was kind of thought you might not like me, you know because You know smaller and and You know I don't look like a seal and then he and I turned out to be good friends, but I remember we're out doing land warfare training and this is like where you know you're cutting the metal like you said You're getting to know each other and you know the guys in the platoon Also trying to figure out what these new guys like all right, what have I what have we got here? it's a way light-hearted question compared to let's go So when you go into the mortgage industry, yeah, and you know there's other people in the office as well Like what did they think about did they know you know you're you're you're past they find out you know, but it's hard to right because in the seal teams we have We have a quiet Professionalism and so one of the things that I've struggled with is you know And you know for us and for those of you don't know see you go through a work up prior going on deployment Which is now you're working together for the first time this is when I'm getting to know you guys You guys are getting to know me we're all getting to know each other where the whole the whole unit is coming together as a team So the laser him and you if you see the video like like you hear guys going like guys are witnessing like nobody's been T-he's like nobody else was gonna happen right now, Yeah, whereas like guys I mean that would be a massive miscalculation You know like really end of life event extinction my event kind of decision To be not to counter I know exactly what you're saying but like The facts are people don't mess with me when I'm out in public. yeah, those are these are helpful men because Yeah, like if they're like hey jacco stop saying like like all the time No, I don't say like right and I talked about this too for those of you are on the podcast You can't you know that are listening and you doesn't look like stereotypical seal He's a hundred and fifty five pounds He's what it how tall are you five seven five seven Susan look he's not your stereotypical seal looking guy now again that the public with that the public with things I guys gonna say There's no stereotype and some of the most badass guys are there every size But this is something that Andrew said to me one time which was You know So I go back in there and I go in and glow for Mikey's palace I go back in there and we just said Hey man you want some of these have beef jerky that's so does he'd have like romans romony rules and he'd always had He had like this heating element like once like you plug into the wall He'd like hey man I know what he's doing I know he's making this isn't let me explain this down the chain of command That's right and that's so helpful and so helpful and when you got guys in the puttune or any organization a high performing organization That are really strong-willed and have strong opinions and by the way are an intelligent and it can make really Articular points as to why they don't agree with something You know again my role in that in that situation Was to ensure that mission success continued to happen that we were still effective as a unit and that meant me Kind of behind the scenes trying to keep keep some guys on board. so That's life Charlie Platoon and when he was on that first podcast We talked about a bunch of things, but one of the main focuses of our conversation was Some of the brothers that we lost Mark Lee who is the first seal killed in Iraq We talked about big holes Ryan Job Who was gravely wounded in Ramadi and who later died after complications From a surgery to repair those wounds then finally we talked about Chris Kyle who Was also in Charlie Platoon was the lead sniper and point man and who ended up writing the book American sniper Which was you know turned into a very successful movie and Chris as you know Was senselessly murdered as he tried to help out a fellow veteran and On that podcast we didn't talk in any depth at all about Mikey Montsour Who is another one of our brother seals from task unit bruiser Who's also killed in Ramadi and if you don't know Mikey was posh and was the award at the Medal of Honor after he Smothered a grenade with his body in order to save three of our other teammates And one of the reasons I didn't want to focus on Mikey during that podcast is because Mike he was in Delta, but to As opposed to Charlie Ptun Charlie's two Patoons in the task unit Charlie and Delta and Charlie was Life was the Patoon commander and Tony a Friday who was on the podcast as well. So so Any is there anything else again without without going into Your personal You know your personal interactions with this incredible family That you want to say and maybe from the perspective of As much as I hate to say this there's gonna be other people that are gonna do this job Being this person that does the notification Is there anything else that you could give advice to people that have to do this job or you know If they if that ever be falls people that I mean we get a lot Andrew we get a lot of big lot of military guys that that reach out to me all the time that are active duty that are doing it up to work or you know, so he was just you know, you know kind of like hopped to or whatever in a very I don't want to make that sound too extreme, you know, but he was surprised to see the command oh and I'm gonna tell you what like it had these like two modes And one where you could shoot or you could like put it right up to the guy You know It's kind of like getting the band back together You know, and those and look those two guys had just come off of Not the greatest deployments either in terms of a junior officer seal right because they were deployed and they were the Assistant commanders And they were getting stuck with not so fun work, you know, so that we were stoked to be all right They were so close. I get the brief and figure out who it is So Start figuring out okay, so now it's now it's a race for those of you that don't know I mean look here's a thing We live in a 24 seven news world and it's a race to notify the family before they find out for some other means and He lives up in Orange County so we started assembling a team and you know Admirals and Commodore's are involved and It look This is the second guy that we have not lost seals on our act to this point mark and Mike now so um You know, it's who's gonna go to the notification Yeah, I'm here to check in like Like the all-seeing I just like Glances like you said what I'll so I'm checking into Buds Wearing that I'm like maybe I should go put in for money. So some guys said to me one time and this is an outside guy and Said because it kind of seems to me that in the tiltings he guys do Stress in evacuation really well and so I would say yes because that's that was exactly my same first firefight I got in I was like No, but deal and you know look you know when the rounds are close but you you're kind of like in every day guy I kind of do so you're like kind of like the guy in the movie who they show him work You know I'm gonna figure it out and then nobody you know first guys not showing up It's like nine, you know, I'm in the reading guideline books trying to just you know I've no I've no paycheck. It's like well, you know, I think I'm like feet think what dude What else do you think is possibly gonna come from this and you know? Let's go and then like the whole pool tune Like everybody like met down in the back cave and There may be a video floating around somewhere This one had the winter barbs that those against no-to-teaser as I like the bar like the winter bars Our longer to get through this weather Who that down coat and then they go to get these things out somebody's got a pair of pliers and in the barbed I remember that you know it's good when you need pliers that much to dislodge the show like it went into the muscle like because like I remember ripping and coming free but not free and so we know we're like You know and buds sort of like if you ain't cheating you ain't trying and if you got you ain't trying hard enough I mean He was just saying look You can I'm learning something new all the time learning something from the new guys, and that's the attitude that prevailed through the task You know not of hey Where the best we don't have to listen to anybody, but hey, we're gonna work as hard as we can We're gonna be the best we can, but we're we got open minds that we're ready to learn at all times It's a fine line between confident and cocky no doubt about and and being humble You can be confident you can be sure and you can be humble and respectful and open to learning new things and maybe based a present which you learn Yeah, there's no doubt about that and So I'm gonna be protective of my platoon you know, so I go in I'm walking out of the platoon space Making sure the door is locked behind me because you know other platoon guys go in and just destroy another guy's platoon space forever and I'm walking down the hallway and our LPO Who is goes down to the door and he doesn't have the combo right you go see goes hey, hey, what's the combo to the space? You know you're like one of those kind guys Do they like do you think that they looked at you like that you know what I mean between me Tony I don't think there was I'm just trying to think if there's any instructor cadre that was putting us through Right, you know, I get there was some guys that were it's you know I wasn't gonna come and ask you because maybe I was a little embarrassed You know about how dire my situation was so if you're a leader just know just like kids who are going through buds They're gonna hide their injuries you know I'm an officer in these two guys Or just you know obviously well in a way, but I'm like hey man I'm gonna just fight to the bitter end and You know look when we got to my key's family's house You know look at all they wanted was to talk to somebody who knew Mikey and the other four guys that were standing there Didn't know didn't serve with them didn't work up with them didn't deploy with them and I got like an odd sleeping style like I can Well as a mole rat you know we have slightly different Cycle so Mikey had a different cycle like everybody would be asleep yeah when you get a task with something you do it and you do it the best your ability and and you know Just to continue that story because I have to say this it was it was a pain the ass job It wasn't fun for me, but man did I learn a lot did I understand a lot did I get to know All the inner workings of of the community because I was there with the guy you know with the amylets and charge of all the seals I was with him For 13 months. I don't know if you remember you know not everybody made it through the workout There were guys who were cut loose Safety issues not stepping up not leading right pushing that leadership opportunity down to the junior officer whatever and not stepping up We're doing something unsafe or just not having what it took and You know When and I don't know what it's like this moment today when I was in the team so now is it Seal team one seal team two seal team seven we I didn't wear shirt Like no, I'm a 35 year old man making money doing with a family I'm not wearing a shirt at work
