and like he says helpless and by the way this is a half an hour of this suddenly we were given continuing suddenly we were given the order to hook up I did so and waited the engines cut back on the approach to our drops on we descended to around 600 feet with all sorts of rubbish whizzing by and the plane pitching and tossing like a toy in a vast vacuum then there came a terrific explosion as our tail was hit the order jump man jumped screamed in my ears and I tumble through the doorway into the void below so they are craft finally takes a devastating hit he doesn't he doesn't mention whether the aircraft made it or not he just says that it you know the tail was hit hard I can't imagine that's super easy to fly a plane what's the tail's been blown off now he gets on the ground again fast forward a little bit on the ground about 300 yards in my left was the main coastal road to the town of Katania and enemy traffic wasn't tremendous confusion to my rear I could hear Italian voices and about a hundred yards to my right Germans wrapping out orders then now the road came a 15 strong German patrol they could have been parachutists judging by their dress and head gear fortunately I was not alone when they were just a few yards off and we opened up on them there were some grunts, groans and sickly yelps then silence we slipped on in the direction of the bridge around which our men were by now silently killing harassing and panicking the German Italian defenders at night small battles raged unceasingly and we were pinned down for a long time by mortar fire when daylight broke though I saw the for the first time the vast mountain scenery at the base of which we had been fighting again I'm just jumping through stuff then the sun starts to come up it became warm and then the heat became intense a typical you're never you can never just be comfortable it's always like freezing cold or too hot you would you he had 15 minutes where it was warm and then they were too hot there had been no firing for some time and I realized that the enemy was no longer with us scanning the countryside I could see burnt out cars Italian tanks and ammunition dumps the smell of burnt bodies and oil filled the air I was glad to move on such a confusion of our brigade such was the confusion of our brigade drop that come daylight three men from the men from three parah discovered they spent all night fighting alongside the men of first pair without realizing it at the bridge it was clear that there had been a fierce battle the pill boxes had been rushed and dealt with ruthlessly here the brigade mustard approximately 180 men but the three inch mortars in ammunition had not arrived and there was a lack of communication without side units wireless sets those are radios had been either incorrectly netted back in Africa were damaged on the landing or just did not arrive we learned that German parachutists from the third regiment of the first fallshemierger division had dropped simultaneously on our drops on the previous night so we must have indeed have brushed shoulders with them when we came upon that 50 man patrol how crazy is that you're jumping into a drop zone and the Germans are jumping in there too and then he grows as things start to escalate he's talking around how hot it was like hot as in not heat temperature but hot as in enemy action little wonder things were so warm the area within an approximately two mile radius of the bridge was festoon with 88 millimeter and 20 millimeter guns pill boxes machine gun pits and also a few coastal guns and we were engaging with crack German troop including pair troops they presented a good target whenever they got too near the bridge you could not miss but word run around that our supply of ammunition was now drastically low conserve ammunition in fire only when you are absolutely certain of a kill was the order but do in due course members of the first and third pair of battalions at the northern end of the bridge with Drew to join us at the southern end the enemy was getting harder to ward off as tanks and tanks began to appear now we got tanks enemy tanks on the scene we were using captured Italian 40 millimeter anti tank gun along with our own anti tank gun the battle worked up to a terrific climax the Germans were sending their best troops in an effort to shift us their pair of troopers probing for weak spots and allowing no respite food was in our haversax but there was no time to get it it was fire fire and keep on firing finally there was a wall at about 1830 or soon after giving us a chance to take stock maybe the Germans wanted to regroup I checked my ammunition and found only four rounds left plus one in the chamber at 1930 we were ordered to withdraw in order to avoid capture and go in small groups we made it off in a westernly direction toward the gona loung the gona lunga river if we could use the river and the road running parallel to it as a guide for a couple miles perhaps then we could be clear of any enemy concentrated attack so these guys are basically bagging out of the area and as they're doing their doing in small groups at one point as darkness fell we came upon a deserted farmhouse but decided not to enter as it was quite near an abandoned flat gun pit we thought both sides would be we thought both could be booby trapped it was approximately zero 200 by now we were very tired in hungry we dosed off in an orchard 20 feet from the edge each man at the base of a different tree so as to be less conspicuous so they spend the night in this orchard and then they set off once again we saw no more of the enemy via lentini we reached Augusta some 50 miles from Primisol Bridge finding the town in our hands it was a great site to see so many of our own troops and tanks and so they continue on reaching Syracuse without miss hop on this on the 17th of July just four days after dropping in Sicily we soon set sail arriving back at Sous in Tunisia on the 20th our first parachute brigade group had not only suffered heavily in the North African campaign but in Sicily too where we had lost a further 300 men killed wounded or missing it was time to rest refit regroup and reorganized and we also got to relax so I mean this this is a group of men that are now just hardened combat that's and yet there's no war there's no end to this in sight nowhere I could hear the gutteral tang twang of German civilians as they ran hell for leather on each side of the train to take cover from what must have been our own aircraft overhead one of the guards just the moose and left it to us looking down to the track I saw that it was much too high for me to jump with only one leg the some of our party of eight jumped and took cover I found my pants and don't know whether it was fright or the dysentery that was still with me the planes returned they were to rocket firing RAF typhoons which specialized in ground attack I recognized the sound as they got nearer there was another woosh and then another followed by an ear splitting explosion the carriage shook so violently that I thought we were going to topple over as always in such a task it was over in no time with such a tax it was over in no time and all of a suddenly peaceful again so they have to go and repair this train and then finally we had reached a snug little village called Myzberg on the German side of the border with Belgium and once again we see some nicer treatment our first job was to be cleaned up and we were taken in pairs into the shower I was asked to remove all personal items from my pockets and all clothing was to be cleaned and few amigated don't worry you'll get everything back and English medic told me here put this on it was a sort of cotton smock which tied in the back was just long enough to cover to the knee first in came a great big American with the same garb with forms like tree branches he lifted me bodily with the ease of samps and himself mind you I was down from 14 stone to just over eight since last September and to translate that into American English he weighed 196 pounds in September and now he weighs 112 on reaching the shower is made ask can you stand on one leg bud sure I said samps and it taken his smock off and proceeded to bathe me while herkilly steadyed me I was carried back to a most luxurious bed with white sheets God knows where the when they scrounge the sheets but trust the yanks there were approximately 40 wounded there a mixture of English French and American with four American and two English orderlies one of the walking wounded act that is a cook all the others doing menial tasks they did not mind though so he's in this pretty car can I even say let's say let's just say and improved situation and improved situation is what is he and that goes on a little bit or even he calls it the luxury things began to live in up outside the rumbling in the distance grunier and groups of bejragled weary looking Germans plotted through the village the wounded born by horse and cart field guns were manhandled the luxury of any motorized transport being afforded to senior officers only who clearly wished to withdraw in his dignified manner as possible leaving hunter officers to do all the donkey work along with the shoots and and suffer all the humiliation of being seen by their own countrymen it was a pathetic sight like a cutting from the first world war film archives as the dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and tanks was very near so he's seeing the Germans kind of walking back he's seeing the officers in the vehicles the German officers in the vehicles and the German troops walking or being carried if they were wounded and years tank activity right which is kind of an indication where you have tank activity but you see people withdrawing with horses and garages that's an indication that perhaps the tanks that we're hearing are good friendly as dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and the tanks was very near you could hear the squeak of the tanks wheels rubbing against the caterpillar track thirsty for lubrication edging and shunting into position for the impending advance in the village that noise that a tank makes in the city is just wind well who is the awesome and and it's also horrifying like these guys when they're hearing the German tanks outside when they're in that that battle whether about to be overrun the horror can't even imagine of tanks coming and now the joy which I got to experience some of the joy in the body of hey the tanks are coming it's glorious and god bless the tankers and here these guys feel in the same way the American orderlies were jubilant they're here lie me the yanks are here exploded Hank anyone who get up walk hop or propel themselves in some way momentarily forgot their wounds in discomfort they peered through the cracks and the doors through the windows I could not see anything from my window only the Nazi flag of the local garrison hanging listless like the enemy itself bill one of the english medics came gashing and not knowing which way to turn in his excitement there's hundreds of them there's hundreds of tanks out there bloody and then they get off that train they get on another train they get on this other train after shunting around a bit and hitching up to another train we rolled off again it was dusk cold and pretty dimo all told then someone struck up our version of the song bless him all and their version of the song was salt them all salt them all belong in the short and the tall salt all the sergeants and the W.O. ones salt all the corpus and their bastard sons for we're saying goodbye to them all as back to their billets they crawl you'll get no promotion aside of the ocean so cheer up me lads saw them all and he says it seemed we had joined a group of British soldiers by this was by way of an introduction they finally make it to bremen we pulled in slowly and as the train came to a stop there were sounds of doors opening in the hustle and bustle of people getting off and making their way along the platform and then it happened an air raid warning wind out civilian military personnel immediately began scurrying about in the military I noticed did not hesitate to shove anyone else out of their way a little shot at the German military the civilians are getting pushed out of the way so they can get to cover the air was humming with aircraft american Boeing b-17 flying fortresses and our guards quick in their step way ahead of us periodically turning to beckon us to hurry it up we entered the shelter being enough for about a hundred people and after a lot of pushing and shoving settled among amid the gliers and remarks thrown our way I was happy to let it happen but somehow I'd been pushed and guided into a corner of the shelter away from the door if a bomb lands two near the the Germans take it blast take the blast and cushion any effect on us I thought there was a wooden batch fixed to the wall I dropped to it exhausted three guards it spread out between us and other occupants and when the bombing started in earnest the shelter shook I was sure wanted landed close outside because I felt it's draft reminding me of being blown off my feet in North Africa only that time it was just 50 feet away everyone fell silent as the drone of aircraft and wind and crash a bombs went on with ever increasing ferocity for a good hour before dying down to a steady drumming and an occasional distant explosion I must admit I always think of these bombing runs as taking like maybe 10 minutes but we're talking about a good hour people began to chatter this is once everything's kind of faded people began to chatter as interfered dispersed and external barvato took over I could hear the gnashing of teeth glances accompanying finger pointing in our direction the crowd is getting rest if in a big man started pouring forth with words of abuse a big frow about 40 years old worked her way near to us until she was only a couple feet away I felt the murt moisture of her spiddlesty argued with the guards about the privilege we had being allowed to be in the same shelter as the German people I gathered that was a crux of the matter that was the crux of the matter at this point a heavy booted foot came out and started propelling my way I parried firmly with my right hand and the boot just brushed my balls coming to a harmless glancing blow on my left thigh the guards stood firm restraining the woman and trying to calm everyone down it was only then that I noticed a familiar sound in French our guards were Frenchmen constricted in the German army anyway they saved my nuts from being cracked there must have been another hours wait at the station another back going to transfer again there must have been another hours waited the station until I an old army type lorry with solid tires turned up or sorry they were waiting for truck I couldn't care less at this stage provided I didn't have to hobble on crutches before long I saw the large POW camp ahead with its eight foot high wire fences and guards platform sticking up like store thumbs all around there was a collection of dingy looking huts dotting the interior the lorry slowed at the gate and the senior guard jumped down through the hand to go through the handing over ceremony then the big wood and wire gates creed open and the lorry jerked into the compound where out we tumbled I was exhausted and sweating as if I just come out of a Turkish bath my stump was throbbing I stayed lying on the ground where I landed managing to support myself on one elbow while the rest of the party sat knelt or remained standing with the aid of their crutches I didn't want a welcoming committee but wished that someone would show us where to go one of the guards was busy having a chat and laughed with his mate eventually he gave us the go ahead and the party moved off slowly and weirdly I found myself left behind I tried to get up but I could not muster enough strength to make it and you're waving your they can't see you so you need I would always have a aircraft panels what we call them aircraft sing with panel which is just bright fluorescent orange and I could whip that thing out really quickly and then it then you become a lot more visible same thing with the aircraft overhead well in a body it didn't take long before everyone was carrying that because and they were carrying big ones too like a platoon or like an element that was going in a building would have a big giant one that you could hang out a window everyone we are here hey friendly forces we are here so even this guy World War II that bright yellow silk scarf in important signaling device at the hand he says I I wondered how the rest of the men were going to fare on this hop I was just getting used to the new faces like Frankie Panzer Manzer Bill Silberry Terry Brace Dick Bingley Dolly Gray major parent brown Sid Oxley Guv Beach with his top hat the Germans will surrender in surprise if he takes him with that I thought Joe McReedy patty McCormick and Captain Joe Gardner that mean just I just had to read those names for two reasons number one because they sound like the best bunch of characters you could ever hang around and also so everyone remembers that all these people that we're talking about they're all people unfortunately sergeant Busty Everett had fallen ill and died at Born we were from all over the country and beyond and on the whole one big happy family it was daylight when we clambered into trucks and headed toward the arrow drone at Barxton Hall everyone was tense but ready to go come what may he goes on here our objective was to capture and hold the bridge straddling the rine at our nm my first parachute patty and was to seize the high ground to the north our escorting typhoon spit fire and Mustang fighters were weaving between the decodes and gliders as we cross the English channel tension began to mount in my plane we approach land on the other side and could see the area that had been flooded to try and stop her and peed the advance of our land forces i was admiring the landscape when the order rang out action stations hook up green light on go being number 13 night a few long seconds to wait as I shuffled forward then i felt a slight pat on my parachute back and again found myself tumbling out of the doorway into that familiar open void my parachute opened once more obediently and i drifted down to earth without difficulty after a good three point landing i was now an enemy occupied territory except for the occasional machine gun fire and some blasting from enemy machine gun placements the landing had been unopposed and the whole dropping north zone north of he'slam was packed with gliders and discarded parachutes everyone soon collected themselves and rendezvous to their perspective points the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of September 1944 the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of September 1944 leaving the drops on we made a way quickly along the track running alongside the wood west of wolfhees and south of the railway the end of the track lined up with a road running parallel to the railway turning right here and then over the road onto the railway sidewalk we noticed our way toward wolfhees station suddenly there was a loud explosion up ahead and some machine gun fire and now this is when things start to get hot our company still upfront became engaged in a fierce battle facing armored cars, mortars and machine guns it was getting dark now the whole battalion laid doggo for a while to try to avoid further detection we lay up in the woods for some hours pushing on occasionally buck cautiously at one point in time unbeknown to the enemy they completely surrounded us in the semi dirt After a fast fast forward after a fast bumpy journey the Jeep tore through Usterbeek passed the net the original headquarters at the heart and steam hotel and pulled up sharply in the drive of the taffled berigo tell a few hundred yards farther on airborne medics quickly unstrap me and took me inside setting me down on the floor opposite a window in the entrance hall the hotel taffled berigo had been German field marshal walther model modells headquarters prior to our arrival the previous Sunday and we were now using it as an improvised military hospital it must have taken a few knocks as it was now in absolute shambles as usual the British Tommy had managed to brew up even in such hazardous conditions and I was given a mug of tea and a bar of chocolate my first foods in sleeping in England two days earlier I had not touched my ghastly iron ration I tried to sleep but with the interruption of shelling and mortar fire prevented that when night fell I just long for daylight to come again I hated the nights it was bad enough to be meeting angry Germans in battle but it was worse to do so while I slept the next day Wednesday I was grateful to be taken into the operating room ingeniously rigged up in the kitchen of the hotel so he gets some he gets some preliminary worked on on his wounds and of course the brits I know I've talked about this they like to brew up their tea and they will do it that's how they roll I was returned to the entrance hall where the den of battle embolitating the wall outside maybe look out I was surprised to be is to see a German wandering about so pictures is you're in a hospital you just got like the shrapnel cut out your leg they sit taken set you down and now you're watching the battle out of window and you see a German wandering around he took up a stand position by the door and then began pacing up and down just then there was a loud crump outside and debris plaster and glass fell all around I looked to see where that one landed and the German I had seen outside only a few moments ago was now sprawled out killed I presumed by one of his own mortar bombs but that should tell you with a situation there there's Germans outside the window walking around I was set down at the head of the stairs to my right leg glider pilot who had a face and arm injury amid all the wounded who covered most of the landing area came a wounded man walking our eyes met did I know him I hardly knew anyone they were unrecognizable clotted up with blood and dirt then up the stairs belted some combat paras and we asked them how it was going I had to had to capture this because this is just as british as it gets so these there's like we just said there's Germans walking around outside this places total shambles and they see a couple paras and he says hey how's it going and one of the paras answers not too bad not too bad could be a bit better before disappearing back down again that's like that's a no factor response what with the continuous den of battle outside in my leg getting more painful through lack of proper medical attention I called for father Benson to offer a few words of comfort so he came and put me at my ease later he was too as wounded by tank fire into the building I'm sorry to say that he died from those wounds and was buried in the grounds of St. Elizabeth's hospital on the following day the disposition was frightening once again under statement the British under statement because as far as I'm concerned everything up to this point is completely horrifying on the following day the disposition was frightening our men were still doing their damnness but the Germans were slowly closing in very slowly mark you for they lost heavily and had to fight for every inch of the bloody ground they got there with things getting hotter still I was moved again to what was thought to be a safer spot just to the other side and along the landing area suddenly there was an all mighty explosion in the room on my right men were already wounded once twice were hit again in somewhere killed there were pittiest cries coming from that room it was at this time that major John Wadi of the 156 parachute battalion who had started his parachute days in India when the battalion was first formed was wounded again and two English medics and a Dutch nurse were killed a medic now came out cradling a form in his arms the chapy carried could have been dead or unconscious he was covered in blood and his arm was shattered and hung prophetically by his side his left leg bandaged from his first wounding Christ I wish I were outside there was another resounding crash of bombs followed by curses perhaps I was better off in here it was bloody awful for everyone everywhere outside the situation was getting completely out of hand further enemy reinforcements were mustering around the perimeter in the form of powerfully armed tanks from the SS Panzer divisions with long barreled high explosives and armor piercing shells the passage where I lay ran from front to rear the hotel and I was facing the rear with a grandstand view of the battle through a gaping hole in the wall where once there had been a window now and again one of our men would break cover to stock the enemy and the enemy would repeat the process with the multiple accompaniment of shell burst tank fire machine gun fire curses and yelps of pain I heard the ominous sound of an approaching tank I couldn't see it but the squeaking of its caterpillar wheels grew even louder then it came into view it's great gun traversing from right to left picking its way through the trees it stopped for a few minutes to feel its way and then the gun barked out sending a shell across my front to an unseen target the other wounded were lying huddled together trying to afford each other protection the floor was littered with debris blood and glass and there was an incest and wind and explosion of mortar bombs together with the shrieking crash of artillery vibrating the very foundations of the building which I thought when it's some point tumbled down I don't know what time it was when the shelling and gun fire stopped but after a den of the last six days it felt very strange to suddenly be so much quieter there were still spasmotic firing in the distance and a little shelling but nothing to worry about we began to converse more freely gone on strike Jerry one man almost shouted except that his head half his mouth bandaged from a shell splinter wound well the next few days seemed to drag on forever with my leg giving me much more pain now than it had during the first 24 hours after I was hit and so obviously these guys are rallied up and they're suffering but it doesn't mean that they're safe continuing on there are so many shells landing in on and around the building plus the occasional burst of machine gun fire spattering the inner walls that I imagine we must be slapped bang in in the front line or somewhere in no man's land by the way that's the field hospital there were hundreds of wounded in enemy included as well as Dutch people caught up in the fight so many that some got moved to the hotels and acts across the driveway and any man with flesh wounds or injuries that did not hinder the use of a firearm was ordered outside to fight so if you could fight now it's time it was now the 23rd of September and I was lying still at the head of the broad stairway and there was commotion down below those ruddy hunds again said the glider pilot there was a shuffling in German orders were being wrapped the out then some SS troops dashed up the stairs a sinister looking type about 20 years old led the way and was coming right out of it coming right at me I found myself looking straight down the barrel of his schmizer his trigger finger shaking I didn't bat an eyelid I just did not want to have set him and give him a cause to let rip he was glaring at me with red BDI's Christ this is it I thought I had heard of other wounded being shot up but my luck was in any past me by he and two other SS men had a good look around and took a and then took up firing positions at windows in rooms leading off the landing as they started to fire out Colonel Warwick dast up the stairs swearing and rebuking them for firing from a clearly marked red cross building discipline took over they look to find and so on but with fingers handling their automatic's hesitantly they reluctantly obey the officers command and stop firing so as I talked about early with the and clearly these are some Germans that have respect for the law of armed conflict and they there which let's just start with this we're in the hospital building and now we got the the Germans in the building using it as a firing position I don't even know what to say about this like what what is that even how do you even translate that into into reality your wounded your your hospital is getting mortar to machine gun and then there's German enemy soldiers in your building firing from inside your building walking around looking at you and I mean it's total insanity right the guys are 20 yards away before they get the the order not only to fire but to advance continuing on this is now they're doing a coordinated attack while we pushed on with two paras and three paras brought up the rear the British 139th brigade attacked on our right in time the pimple on this name of like a little null was retaken and our brigade proceeded to press home the final assault amidst devastating artillery and mortar fire from both sides tragically we found that we had gone a little too fast for our 25 pounders to increase their range quickly enough and we suffered heavy casualties from our own fire at daylight I passed a jock Pearson crouched by a rock bellowing into a field radio and none too pleased with the person on the other end what do you think you're doing he wrote you're killing all my bloody men so little horrible blue on blue scenario happening man everything but everything seemed to be in our favor now even the weather was kinder and we must have advanced about eight miles under a curtain of continuous fire both until both Italians and Germany were ready to give in and we're running to be captured so think about this scene with just massive fire and you're advancing under that fire for eight miles they get um they're they're doing this they're continuing to advance in this part and here measure schmets buzz the area spraying the ground spasmotically and causing those nearest to drop quickly into convenient holes we pushed on at a steady pace passed demolition guns past demolished guns and supplied dumps the air stinking with a pollen butchery I glanced and stinctively towards a shell burst fifty yards away as I watched its jet black smoke belt skyward my gaze was transfixed by something odd on the ground I wanted if it could be a human drawing nearer I saw that it was the roasted body of a man in the sitting position he must have been driving a scout car or light vehicle as there were small pieces of charred twisted metal spread fifty feet around with dismembered arms and legs torn and blood soaked uniforms littering the black scorched soil the aroma was diabolical someone accidentally brushed the sitting form on passing and the body simply disintegrated with a sickly sound fast forwarding a bit the smell of burnt flesh coated in my direction and I quickly and I quick into my pace to get clear of it plotting on in these awful humid and dusty conditions I think I felt almost immune to wearing this and the shocking sights of war nothing seemed to be able to stop us now and this is again you got to read this book but this site sort of concludes this section the first parachute brigade group was not destined to take part in the final push to tuna's our role in the campaign had come to an end and we were withdrawn from the line so ending five months hard slog and again that we were just burning through this book and I'm skipping so many sections this stuff is this is five months this is half a year just about of this type of fighting originally trained as shock troops in Tunisia after the initial parachute assaults we had served as plain infantry but that's just the way the wind blew for us metals were plentiful and all ranks had earned them eight distinguished service orders 15 military crosses nine distinguished conduct metals 22 military metals three raw digger and one legion to honor in their own way even our German adversaries had recognized the brigades fighting ability by naming us the red devils for those who are there though the price of success was unspeakably high we had lost more than 1700 men killed wounded or missing so again I hate to burn through five months of insane fighting and I'll take a dig at red right now like he's so matter of fact about stuff and he only hits on the high points I'm hitting on the high points of the high points right just insane insane to think about that for five months so from there they're transported from Tunisia back to Algeria and they spend time training for a drop into Sicily a parachute drop in Sicily which once again you're fighting in Africa look it's really tough conditions in Africa now you're getting closer to Germany like you're going into going into Sicily you know what's waiting for you it was hoped that if Sicily could be taken it might prompt an Italian surrender a large proportion of my battalion including myself now went down with this entry goes in and talking about a lot of that this is no this is just it's like no nothing's easy between exercises we acclimat acclimatized our reinforcements to use every they're used every type of enemy weapons including Schmeizer automatic which we found superior to our own standgun so now they start preparing for this mission in Sicily there were three bridges to take in Sicily and the password for them was to be desert rats with the reply kill Italians as the plane took off chunky said well this is it our second operation I tried to act normally but could feel the sweat running down my cheek so once again he's stifling some emotions in here they go getting on this getting ready to do this drop and this is just it's just crazy as we drew nearer to our objective and at a thousand feet I could see the flack and tracer zipping past the wing of the aircraft for 30 minutes we dodged everything they threw at us so when you see when you see the depravity that that human beings are capable of well that can actually expose the fact that you really can cherish all innocent let us in a little dog and these guys arrived back home get stationed the first battalion get stationed at Grim's Thorpe Castle and at this point they know something really big is in the air and he says here in August men coming from our old training area of Tatten Park reported seeing thousands of tanks there like a giant tank park sure enough in mid-September we were finally setting off somewhere I checked over my gear one gammon bomb two dot three six hand grenades combined pick and shovel webbing equipment with small pack two ammunition pouches and bandlear with three oh three ammunition water bottle mess tin iron ration field dressing camouflage net scarf triangle shape air recognition bright yellow silk scarf tied around the neck for ready for instant use rifle and an escape kit comprising of a silk map of Europe a small button compass and a strong file the size of a nail file that was about it except for a kit bag strap to the leg and parachute plus may-west life jacket in case we finished up in the drink I felt like an overdue pregnant hippo and didn't know where to put anything else though still I added 200 cigarettes two bars of chocolate and some boiled sweets it's interesting the yellow scarf for recognition and he specifically says tied around the neck for instant use and it's interesting we we kind of I always carried one the basic reason why I was carried one because I was a radio man when I was a young and listed guy and I used it at times I had learned the value of it signaling helicopters and signaling boats in the jungle like if you and the weird thing is you when you're in a boat let's say you're in a river along the jungle there's so much jungle to look at that it's really hard to see someone waving their hand like it seems so obvious when you're waving at some waving at a boat and we had our work cut out here there was agonizing shrieks of pain right and left to me as I passed unrecognizable as I passed men unrecognizable soaked in blood being tended to a barrage splendid medics those unsung unarmed heroes Sam cost her and Frankie Thompson reached the summit and searched out and dealt with the enemy with no ceremony whatsoever as Sam told me afterward Frankie was lunging and tossing men with his bayonet as though he as though they were sacks of straw Frankie was a big chap usually very friendly and quietly spoken but an action a different man picture that bayonet on your rifle and your throwing men off of it lunging and throwing men with the bayonet as if they were sacks of straw Frankie Thompson done play amid the turn all the turmoil and dead and wounded of both sides the curtain of fire had lifted and it was not a sound this is once they get up to the hilltop looking around the hilltop only a few of our men could be seen moving among the twisted forms our R T and S companies had suffered very heavy casualties more than half of the battalion officers had been killed or wounded he as they kind of get settled on the top of the hill he as they're preparing for a counter attack which they know the Germans are going to do he gets sort of tasked with going around and helping and gather up the sick dead or the wounded in the dead he goes on here setting about the job of collecting the wounded was something sickening as I gazed upon the scene of our once able and live comrades now quite still or with torn limbs I wondered whether there was any such thing as civilization I bet hard on my lip and went about my task with grim determination looking around for someone to help I noticed a lad who is in the same troop as me early in 1941 hello taffy and one of you been up to like a lift that's how he greets this guy cheers lofty and like I said lofty is the nickname of red cheers lofty is nice to see someone alive he said weirdly he was in a sitting position and apparently been hit by no fewer than five bullets they were all clean flesh wounds in the calf five four arm and one through the apex of his penis and all rather uncomfortable but no broken bones he was pretty well saturated with blood but cheerful let's try a fireman's carry I suggested he'd had a shot of morphine no we're declaring war on the third and in September the third of September we're declaring war and then in September two weeks later you're on the ground in France ready to get some in the forward positions so now they they start moving forward from France in the forward positions we took over deserted village called Tromborn about six miles from the German border as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided to make use of sheets to create so they're in these areas that are pretty much abandoned and so they're going into houses and finding stuff as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided to make use of sheets to create sets of camouflage gear white suits gloves over boots hats and coverings for rifles hunting around we've I found a sewing machine thinking that we might as well do things the easy way as a fighting patrol we didn't fire a shot there's more matter of listening and night reconnaissance in our white outfits carrying only rifles and are limited other gear we traveled more comfortably than we had previously which I skipped over the part where they're basically doing long long movements to get into positions on one night reconnaissance we became over confident don't what that happened and one of our lads knocked up against the enemy wire it was a still bright moonlit night we were in no man's land just 75 feet from the forward German positions they're talking of stop to abruptly as luck would have it we were crawling so we froze hugging the ground for an hour without moving on another occasion we were on our way back to base when from and by the way on that one they they make it out on another occasion we were on our way back to base when from the direction of a bend in the road 50 yards away we saw a group of figures we were about two miles from our lines and knew that no other patrols were out so these men must be the enemy our patrol leader gave the signal a lie still we were straddled each side of the road in semi-open ground but fortunately the night was not too bright the group passed by ten men in all spaced six to eight feet apart they were well-armed but war no white suits keeping them in view and moving only our eyes we lay unnoticed if we had been spotted they would have had the advantage because of their automatic weapons and also the fact that they as they passed down our center we could not have fired on them for fear of hitting our own men never separate your forces which is hard when you're walking down a road because when you're walking down a road you're going to be in a what's called a staggered file which means you got guys on either side of the road right which generally we're trying to stay off the roads anyways but I became oblivious to fatigue and plotted on at the end of the day's training I would stretch out on the hangar for absolutely shagged on passing sergeant Sid Oxley might prod me and say something like not bad lad not bad do better tomorrow eh get stuffed was the usual quiet reply as I slipped a well earned cigarette between my lips and drew hard so there's a pretty good chunk of this training in there and again all this training was they just created this they just created that this was new where like we're making up and props one thing when I look at the course of my entire life there's like a couple moments in time where things made an impression on me and one of the things that made an impression on me as a little kid was I had these toy soldiers I had a lot of toy soldiers but the British commandos from World War II they had little ladders they had little grappling hooks they had boats and they had beanies right you know what I'm talking about I when you're a little you don't know what a beanie is I know a beanie is and I'm sure there's a bunch of other you know like a a fatherly instinct right or a motherly instinct or uh here's another interesting one some people like to travel right so people want to move around a lot some people want to stay home there's like different levels of instincts that people have some people want to settle down and hold what you got some people don't want to do that at all so people have various instincts so I would say that what they did in this training is hone the instincts that people did have and get rid of people that didn't have enough of the instinct for war and you know once again talking about seal training they're not really teaching you anything they're just getting rid of people that don't have the right instinct and even like these you went through these things where the environment sort of provided these lessons no matter how like over or covert they were like provided to you through the environment like you know like a like a farmer or something like this someone who's sort of grew up just working hard as a way of life you put them in another environment we're working hard will show itself or whatever or they'll work hard so now this is the land they move and now they get into a situation we were machine gun costly one minute we were in put in buses and the next taking cover once with Pat Dolan and chunky I dash for safety across an open ground and slid into a hundred feet slid into a hollow 100 feet from a derode as three small specks of mishrishmets came diving straight for us from 4,000 feet I lay on my stomach looking at the aircraft through my camouflage net scarf as they came in fast much closer now and three of them open fire one concentrating on the road transport the other two honor men scrambling for cover on each side of the road bullet slash the ground ten feet from us kicking up fountains of dust bloody hell pat that was close said chunky they circled and came in for another run this time really low only about 50 feet from the ground a couple of our act-act guns let fly jerry let rip and muck seem to be flying everywhere mainly rock splinters and dust as one aircraft clattered by I saw quite plainly the pilot with a white scarf around his neck you fucking fool you might have killed us someone shouted and then let out a bellowing laugh amazingly after all that strafing no one was seriously hurt and only two of our vehicles were rendered unserviceable as time went on things continued to hot up and the buses were soon abandoned in favor of foot slogging so again this is like a horrifying thing to think about these measures met one-on-nines coming down and strafing you with machine gun this pushing forward a little bit in the book there another situation then they turn towards us three stucodive bombers approaching us at about five thousand feet the sky was clear invisibility was good it was most weird not knowing whether they were interested in us or just passing but they were interested in us all right the leading pilot made half a roll and nose down the preliminary commencing that awe-inspiring stucodive angle of 85 degrees as it wind nearer and then we get this in August I received a telegram telling me that my home in south London had been hit by a sea mine and I was given compassionate leave to return what the hell was a sea mine doing inland it must be a mistake I thought however apparently there was such a thing which came down attached to a parachute so that's what the Nazis were doing and so he gets little leave to go and check things out and so he goes and here we go this is him finding his home upon reaching Grove Park as I turned into fairfield road I immediately saw that our house had received a direct hit there is now just a heap of debris where once it stood half a dozen houses and dozens more were badly damaged the local ARP warden told me that not one person had been killed because everyone had taken to their Anderson air raid shelters my parents were both okay and staying with some friends of mile of the road it was a shock to see our home destroyed but after all I had seen in France I think I must have become immune to any real emotions and then this happens in October as a result of a directive sent out by our prime minister Winston Churchill we received a letter which was read out to us by the regimental sergeant major volunteers he shouted for a new type of fighting soldier are required he glanced over the top of the paper BDI's registering some amusement soldiers he carried on to be trained as commandos and parachutists now I know that you would not wish to desert the regiment but anyone wishing to volunteer one-paced forward march glaring as he did so he took three stealthy steps towards us well you all chicken then there was not a titer nor even a hesitant shuffle meaning everyone was just standing fast I fought back to the days in France I thought of a carnage of the British prisoners of war the warric regiment heard it into a field just outside Dunkirk and machine gun to death by the waffen SS I thought of my home being blown to smithereens and how the Germans were blocking my ambition to become a London policeman I took a pace forward before it was too late and some time passes as they try and get everything organized and then it continues on I was to join number two commando later renamed the 11th special air service battalion and still later the first parachute battalion in Britain at that time there was little no knowledge of the techniques of parachuting so everything had to be thought out very carefully there were no special types of parachutes for jumping from aircraft and no suitable aircraft the whole lot had to be devised developed and tested all too often with fatal casualties or severe injuries just learning how to conduct parachute operations from scratch so they start their training and the training is is really really hard as you can imagine here we go now we settled down to some real soldiering and I actually begin to enjoy the tests thrust upon us yeah devastated mentally devastated that's why it's one of the best things well not a lot you know there's a lot of people that don't get out of that bed right they don't get out of that bed because as soon as you get out you're going straight to the surf zone and people don't like that man I mean you can hear seals talk about it guys can get scarred from liking the ocean for years man for years they they don't want to go in the water they don't want to do it because because they just they use it as an implementive torture me I didn't care you know like I surfed and it was all good you know let's go get some sort of how back to the book so he's home so do you what do you think do you think that that's like good like is that and of course I'm gonna say is it the best way because we know it's the best way but is that kind of the best way to do it because it kind of seems like it could be the best way to do it like it's definitely it's definitely you're not gonna get neat but it still seems like you got all those methods we'll say like from you know like you weren't born with that you know kind of thing you know it seems like you know you got
