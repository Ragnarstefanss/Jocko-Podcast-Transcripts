00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.68
This is Jockel podcast number 265 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:05.68 --> 00:00:06.68
Good evening, Echo.

3
00:00:06.68 --> 00:00:07.68
Good evening.

4
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:10.32
And also joining us tonight is Dave Burk, Good evening, Dave.

5
00:00:10.32 --> 00:00:11.32
Good evening.

6
00:00:11.32 --> 00:00:15.28
So last podcast, we introduced Marine Corps,

7
00:00:15.28 --> 00:00:17.92
Doctional Publication at One Tack for, which is called,

8
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:19.72
Competing.

9
00:00:19.72 --> 00:00:22.24
And of course, we only made it one chapter deep because,

10
00:00:22.24 --> 00:00:24.80
well, there's a lot to go into.

11
00:00:24.80 --> 00:00:27.72
And so we're going to continue on.

12
00:00:27.72 --> 00:00:31.000
But first, we're going to take a little tangential trip

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.20
into my head a little bit.

14
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:37.56
So in reading that manual and as I talked about this,

15
00:00:37.56 --> 00:00:42.36
I started correlating competing with influencing.

16
00:00:42.36 --> 00:00:44.64
And you take that one step further, which isn't very,

17
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:46.56
a very big step.

18
00:00:46.56 --> 00:00:47.40
What is influencing?

19
00:00:47.40 --> 00:00:48.52
Influencing is leading.

20
00:00:48.52 --> 00:00:50.32
That's what you're doing.

21
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:55.24
So one of the main things that I liked about this Marine

22
00:00:55.24 --> 00:00:57.40
Corps concept of competing was this idea

23
00:00:57.40 --> 00:01:00.96
of this continuum of competition that they present in this book.

24
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:06.84
That goes from pure peace on one side, just pure peace.

25
00:01:06.84 --> 00:01:08.28
And then it starts to move to the right.

26
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:12.84
It goes to economic competition in then classic diplomacy

27
00:01:12.84 --> 00:01:14.000
and then political warfare.

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.76
And then there's this gray zone and you get into hybrid war.

29
00:01:17.76 --> 00:01:19.52
And then you get into the threat of violence.

30
00:01:19.52 --> 00:01:22.12
And then you finally cross the,

31
00:01:22.12 --> 00:01:24.44
what they call the violence threshold.

32
00:01:24.44 --> 00:01:28.36
And then to, so you're now you're using violence.

33
00:01:28.36 --> 00:01:36.36
And then even violence has a place that expands on this continuum.

34
00:01:36.36 --> 00:01:40.40
It goes to from conventional war and then it keeps going further

35
00:01:40.40 --> 00:01:42.20
and further to the right to you get to total war,

36
00:01:42.20 --> 00:01:45.36
where one side is using any in all means.

37
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:47.84
And that's certainly completely destroyed there.

38
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:49.24
I mean.

39
00:01:49.24 --> 00:01:54.24
And so with that, I started thinking about

40
00:01:54.24 --> 00:01:59.24
the continuum of influence or the continuum of leadership

41
00:02:01.92 --> 00:02:06.48
that we have to use every day to lead an influence people.

42
00:02:06.48 --> 00:02:10.48
And it draws some very interesting parallels

43
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:14.72
to the continuum of competition at the Marine Corps

44
00:02:14.72 --> 00:02:18.16
talks about and there's one specific mark in there

45
00:02:18.16 --> 00:02:21.32
that really showed a lot of similarities to me.

46
00:02:21.32 --> 00:02:24.32
So if we look at this continuum from the beginning,

47
00:02:26.36 --> 00:02:30.48
like on the far side, you have someone that you don't care about.

48
00:02:30.48 --> 00:02:32.28
You don't care what they're doing.

49
00:02:32.28 --> 00:02:33.92
You're not trying to influence them.

50
00:02:33.92 --> 00:02:35.56
You don't want them to do anything at all.

51
00:02:35.56 --> 00:02:36.40
You just don't care.

52
00:02:36.40 --> 00:02:38.28
They're off their like, off the spectrum.

53
00:02:38.28 --> 00:02:40.44
I guess they're touching it, but they're not on it yet.

54
00:02:40.44 --> 00:02:41.92
So we don't have to worry about them.

55
00:02:41.92 --> 00:02:44.44
We don't care what they're doing at all.

56
00:02:44.44 --> 00:02:48.32
Now, as soon as you cross that first little threshold

57
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:53.32
and now you've got someone that you want to influence.

58
00:02:53.52 --> 00:02:56.68
You want them to follow a plan or you want them to execute an action

59
00:02:56.68 --> 00:02:59.000
or you want them to execute a behavior.

60
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.28
So now we're on to the continuum of influence

61
00:03:01.28 --> 00:03:03.88
or the continuum of leadership.

62
00:03:03.88 --> 00:03:05.32
So what does it start with?

63
00:03:06.52 --> 00:03:08.12
Well, it starts with we're trying to build a relationship

64
00:03:08.12 --> 00:03:08.96
with that person.

65
00:03:08.96 --> 00:03:09.96
That's where we're going to begin.

66
00:03:09.96 --> 00:03:11.16
And what's interesting, what's the best way

67
00:03:11.16 --> 00:03:12.64
to start building a relationship with someone?

68
00:03:12.64 --> 00:03:14.96
You let them start to influence you.

69
00:03:14.96 --> 00:03:16.80
So as soon as you're saying, hey, that's a good,

70
00:03:16.80 --> 00:03:18.28
I like that, I like what you're doing.

71
00:03:18.28 --> 00:03:20.000
And you're there's that.

72
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.88
You've heard of this thing mirroring.

73
00:03:21.88 --> 00:03:23.16
Have you heard this?

74
00:03:23.16 --> 00:03:25.04
So mirroring is the physical.

75
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:26.92
Oh, if Dave's hit the sitin with his hand

76
00:03:26.92 --> 00:03:29.84
on his cheek, then I do the same thing.

77
00:03:29.84 --> 00:03:31.64
And it's a little indicator.

78
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:33.76
I'm allowing you to see that you're kind of influencing

79
00:03:33.76 --> 00:03:34.80
me and it's a positive thing.

80
00:03:34.80 --> 00:03:37.24
So that's the base thing right there.

81
00:03:37.24 --> 00:03:41.36
A physical, actual mimicry of what you're doing, mirroring

82
00:03:41.36 --> 00:03:42.20
what you're doing.

83
00:03:42.20 --> 00:03:43.20
And that's my first way of showing you that.

84
00:03:43.20 --> 00:03:44.20
I'm allowing you a little influence.

85
00:03:44.20 --> 00:03:48.96
So now that's starting to build a good rapport between us.

86
00:03:48.96 --> 00:03:52.32
So that's like the lowest level.

87
00:03:52.32 --> 00:03:53.32
And then what am I going to do?

88
00:03:53.32 --> 00:03:54.44
I'm going to listen what you have to say.

89
00:03:54.44 --> 00:03:56.08
And so I'm starting to build this relationship

90
00:03:56.08 --> 00:03:57.48
and people don't think this way.

91
00:03:57.48 --> 00:03:58.72
People miss this, right?

92
00:03:58.72 --> 00:04:00.68
People don't understand that when I mirror you

93
00:04:00.68 --> 00:04:01.88
and when I listen to you, I'm actually

94
00:04:01.88 --> 00:04:02.84
starting to gain influence.

95
00:04:02.84 --> 00:04:04.52
People totally miss that all the time.

96
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:06.32
They completely miss that.

97
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:07.80
But that's level one, right?

98
00:04:07.80 --> 00:04:10.32
It's incredibly important level.

99
00:04:10.32 --> 00:04:15.16
But it's level whatever point zero zero eight or whatever

100
00:04:15.16 --> 00:04:17.52
that numbers.

101
00:04:17.52 --> 00:04:18.84
So we're just listening.

102
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:21.84
We're letting them model where we're mirroring their behavior

103
00:04:21.84 --> 00:04:22.68
a little bit.

104
00:04:22.68 --> 00:04:27.000
Eventually as we start to escalate, we start to model

105
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.32
our behavior for them a little bit.

106
00:04:29.32 --> 00:04:30.48
But we start acting a certain way.

107
00:04:30.48 --> 00:04:31.64
We're not asking you to do it.

108
00:04:31.64 --> 00:04:33.56
We're just doing it.

109
00:04:33.56 --> 00:04:37.48
And we're hoping that that influence

110
00:04:37.48 --> 00:04:43.04
rubs off on the other person and now they start to do the

111
00:04:43.04 --> 00:04:44.24
same thing.

112
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:47.08
And this is another thing that you can do.

113
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:49.48
You do it subconsciously, maybe do it consciously.

114
00:04:49.48 --> 00:04:55.72
But people are in a line at a grocery store.

115
00:04:55.72 --> 00:04:58.68
And a new line opens up.

116
00:04:58.68 --> 00:05:01.72
And if no one sees it, if you just,

117
00:05:01.72 --> 00:05:03.60
if no one sees it, you can just walk over to that line

118
00:05:03.60 --> 00:05:05.68
and then people see it and they kind of model your behavior

119
00:05:05.68 --> 00:05:06.32
and you're kind of influenced

120
00:05:06.32 --> 00:05:07.84
like a bunch of people that you don't even know.

121
00:05:07.84 --> 00:05:11.96
But it's just a way of modeling behavior

122
00:05:11.96 --> 00:05:13.56
and setting this over here all the time, right?

123
00:05:13.56 --> 00:05:14.56
Set the example.

124
00:05:14.56 --> 00:05:15.40
Set a good example.

125
00:05:15.40 --> 00:05:16.16
That's a good way to lead.

126
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:18.20
For sure, that's outstanding.

127
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:24.44
Eventually though, maybe that's not enough, right?

128
00:05:24.44 --> 00:05:30.72
Maybe we're trying to influence someone to do something,

129
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:38.72
either follow a plan, adjust their behavior, take a certain action.

130
00:05:38.72 --> 00:05:40.12
If we're trying to get someone to do that,

131
00:05:40.12 --> 00:05:42.32
and they haven't really followed our modeling,

132
00:05:42.32 --> 00:05:45.60
now we got to start escalating and going a little bit harder.

133
00:05:45.60 --> 00:05:46.68
So that's a little bit harder.

134
00:05:46.68 --> 00:05:50.80
Well, asking good questions, asking earnest questions.

135
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:52.68
Oh, hey, hey, Dave, why do you do this like that?

136
00:05:52.68 --> 00:05:54.08
And it's just a way.

137
00:05:54.08 --> 00:05:57.32
And then listen so that as Dave explains to me

138
00:05:57.32 --> 00:05:58.80
why he's doing something a certain way,

139
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:01.60
maybe it reveals to him, because now he's looking at it

140
00:06:01.60 --> 00:06:03.000
from a detached perspective.

141
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.32
That's an amazing thing about asking someone a question.

142
00:06:05.32 --> 00:06:06.80
When you ask someone a question,

143
00:06:06.80 --> 00:06:10.20
it detaches them from what they're doing.

144
00:06:10.20 --> 00:06:12.04
That's what makes it such a powerful tool.

145
00:06:12.04 --> 00:06:14.000
Because when Dave is just sitting there with his pen

146
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.20
and he's fiddling with his pen,

147
00:06:15.20 --> 00:06:16.52
he's not even noticing that he's doing it,

148
00:06:16.52 --> 00:06:17.92
which he's literally doing right now.

149
00:06:17.92 --> 00:06:20.04
But as soon as I say, hey, if I didn't want him to do that,

150
00:06:20.04 --> 00:06:21.92
if it was blurring the camera or something,

151
00:06:21.92 --> 00:06:25.000
hey, why are you, why you keep fiddling with that pen?

152
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.76
He has to detach to actually figure out why he's doing it.

153
00:06:28.76 --> 00:06:30.44
Which is a great thing,

154
00:06:30.44 --> 00:06:32.12
because we always want people to detach

155
00:06:32.12 --> 00:06:34.24
and see things from the outside.

156
00:06:34.24 --> 00:06:37.88
So just asking an earnest question is a really good

157
00:06:37.88 --> 00:06:41.08
escalation on this continuum that we're going through.

158
00:06:44.36 --> 00:06:49.48
Now, that little question and answer session that we're having

159
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:51.64
kind of leads to a discussion where we're actually

160
00:06:51.64 --> 00:06:52.92
having a discussion, well, you know,

161
00:06:52.92 --> 00:06:54.20
sometimes I just like to fidget.

162
00:06:54.20 --> 00:06:55.68
It makes me think, oh, that's interesting.

163
00:06:55.68 --> 00:06:58.48
So we can have a, we can have an actual conversation.

164
00:06:58.48 --> 00:07:00.24
And that whole discussion that we're having,

165
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:04.24
if I'm utilizing this correctly,

166
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:08.64
I'm guiding you, I'm guiding Dave, in this case,

167
00:07:08.64 --> 00:07:13.60
I'm guiding Dave to discover what I'm trying,

168
00:07:13.60 --> 00:07:15.20
I want you to discover the fact that, hey,

169
00:07:15.20 --> 00:07:16.40
if you're fidgeting with that pen,

170
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:18.32
people aren't even paying attention to what you're saying

171
00:07:18.32 --> 00:07:20.08
and it's making noise on camera and it's like,

172
00:07:20.08 --> 00:07:21.84
I want you to discover those things.

173
00:07:21.84 --> 00:07:23.12
And I want you to actually tell me about them,

174
00:07:23.12 --> 00:07:24.08
because then it comes from you,

175
00:07:24.08 --> 00:07:29.20
and that's infinitely more powerful.

176
00:07:29.20 --> 00:07:32.08
So, but sometimes it doesn't work.

177
00:07:32.08 --> 00:07:33.68
And sometimes even though someone detaches,

178
00:07:33.68 --> 00:07:36.40
they just don't, they can't get far enough away from that thing.

179
00:07:36.40 --> 00:07:37.52
So where does it go from there?

180
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:40.72
Well, now I'm going to maybe offer an indirect,

181
00:07:40.72 --> 00:07:43.76
little statement about what's going on.

182
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:46.24
You know, just a little, you know,

183
00:07:46.24 --> 00:07:49.92
do you think it's distracting when you do that?

184
00:07:49.92 --> 00:07:51.52
With someone's watching you?

185
00:07:51.52 --> 00:07:55.52
I've always found that distracting,

186
00:07:55.52 --> 00:07:57.76
if someone's talking to me, but they're fidgeting.

187
00:07:57.76 --> 00:08:00.08
So now I'm just, I'm going to little, it's indirect,

188
00:08:00.08 --> 00:08:03.04
but it still is, I'm starting to put a little bit more pressure

189
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:04.000
with that statement, and of course,

190
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.64
now what I'm going to do, and we'll listen what you have to say.

191
00:08:07.84 --> 00:08:09.60
And so where does it escalate from there?

192
00:08:09.60 --> 00:08:12.08
Now Dave's still not paying attention to what I'm saying.

193
00:08:12.08 --> 00:08:14.000
He's still just sitting there fidgeting with the pen,

194
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.08
and it's distracting to everyone, it's making noise,

195
00:08:16.08 --> 00:08:19.52
and it's messing up the focus, the camera's all kinds of problems.

196
00:08:19.52 --> 00:08:22.64
But Dave doesn't care, or whatever, he hasn't seen it yet.

197
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:27.36
So then maybe we escalate a little bit more,

198
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:31.36
and now, you know, it's my metaphors about to lose a little bit of traction,

199
00:08:31.36 --> 00:08:36.16
because that's such a minor thing that this next step,

200
00:08:37.92 --> 00:08:39.92
well, to say, hey, why don't we make a pro,

201
00:08:39.92 --> 00:08:43.44
like a pro and con list about fidgeting your pen, right?

202
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:46.08
Now if we were talking about, you know,

203
00:08:46.08 --> 00:08:48.16
going into a new market area with a business,

204
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:50.08
and you were like, hey, we're going, we're going, we're going,

205
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:51.68
we're going in, I had tried to influence you,

206
00:08:51.68 --> 00:08:52.80
and I tried to ask you questions about it,

207
00:08:52.80 --> 00:08:54.000
and I couldn't get you there.

208
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.92
Then my next escalation might be,

209
00:08:55.92 --> 00:08:58.56
hey, why don't we do a pros and cons on that?

210
00:08:58.56 --> 00:09:00.32
I'm still not coming at you.

211
00:09:00.32 --> 00:09:04.48
I'm just asking, asking, like, hey, why don't we do some pros and cons?

212
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:05.92
That way, once again, what am I doing?

213
00:09:05.92 --> 00:09:07.68
You're going to have to detach you a pros and cons,

214
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:09.84
this is one of the benefits of doing a pros and cons list.

215
00:09:09.84 --> 00:09:12.96
Is it detaches you, takes some of those emotions away,

216
00:09:12.96 --> 00:09:17.28
and now we're sitting here saying, okay, Dave is detached to say,

217
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:19.92
well, these are some positive things, it helps me think,

218
00:09:19.92 --> 00:09:22.32
it gives me something to do with my hands,

219
00:09:22.32 --> 00:09:23.52
or let's go to the market area.

220
00:09:23.52 --> 00:09:25.36
Hey, here's the positive things about the market area.

221
00:09:25.36 --> 00:09:27.68
We don't have any stores there.

222
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:29.76
There seems to be a decent market, here's the cons,

223
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:31.76
it's going to, that's high rents in that area, whatever.

224
00:09:31.76 --> 00:09:36.16
So now you can start to reveal, you reveal,

225
00:09:36.16 --> 00:09:39.44
instead of me revealing you, hey, man, the rents over there are ridiculous.

226
00:09:39.44 --> 00:09:42.64
Instead of me revealing that to you, which offends you?

227
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:45.84
In general, it offends people to just tell them anything.

228
00:09:45.84 --> 00:09:48.56
It's much better when you tell me, now all of a sudden it's your idea,

229
00:09:48.56 --> 00:09:50.56
and this is a beautiful thing.

230
00:09:51.60 --> 00:09:53.28
So that's like sort of the next thing.

231
00:09:53.28 --> 00:09:56.80
It's sort of another little level of escalation that you could do on this continual.

232
00:09:57.76 --> 00:10:02.24
Where I'm moving in that direction, I'm still trying to indirectly influence you.

233
00:10:04.40 --> 00:10:09.36
And maybe the next thing I do is offer some kind of a bargain,

234
00:10:09.36 --> 00:10:13.52
some kind of a negotiation, where I say, hey, you know,

235
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:17.68
maybe now is not the right time to go in that market, or maybe we look at it next quarter.

236
00:10:17.68 --> 00:10:24.56
Right, so it's a little negotiation to try and see if, if I can get you to think a little bit more about it.

237
00:10:24.56 --> 00:10:25.76
It's just an negotiation.

238
00:10:28.16 --> 00:10:31.44
And look, maybe you go, yeah, yeah, because maybe you saw just enough,

239
00:10:31.44 --> 00:10:34.16
maybe you saw, maybe it just revealed just enough of the problems that you're going,

240
00:10:34.16 --> 00:10:36.80
you know, maybe we do, you know, do this.

241
00:10:37.44 --> 00:10:38.80
Maybe we may move away with the next quarter.

242
00:10:38.80 --> 00:10:39.52
Yeah, we can do that.

243
00:10:40.56 --> 00:10:42.64
And there's another little technique that's going on there too,

244
00:10:42.64 --> 00:10:44.72
which is I'm giving you now, right?

245
00:10:44.72 --> 00:10:46.64
Yeah, well, wait, next. Yeah, that's probably a good idea, right?

246
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:50.64
So you are sort of, you start to see some of those issues, but you don't want to

247
00:10:50.64 --> 00:10:53.52
concede that your idea was not good.

248
00:10:53.52 --> 00:10:57.52
So instead, you just concede that it will just push it off a little bit, but it's still a good idea.

249
00:10:57.52 --> 00:11:00.24
So that way your ego remains intact and it's all good.

250
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:02.88
But maybe you didn't catch that.

251
00:11:04.80 --> 00:11:07.12
So now we're going to start to brush up against,

252
00:11:07.12 --> 00:11:11.60
we're starting to brush up against me being just direct with you,

253
00:11:13.60 --> 00:11:18.64
which is revealing some shortfalls, like just saying to you, hey, you know,

254
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:25.20
the rents in that area are really high and by the way, two similar businesses went into that market

255
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:28.64
and both of them washed out and that happened in the last 18 months.

256
00:11:29.68 --> 00:11:30.96
Those are real concerns.

257
00:11:33.04 --> 00:11:35.76
And even when I do that, so now I'm showing you, like,

258
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:37.68
those are no longer things that you revealed.

259
00:11:37.68 --> 00:11:39.36
Those are now things that I'm telling you.

260
00:11:39.36 --> 00:11:46.72
So this is a transition and, and I'm sure you're tracking this, but this whole thing is

261
00:11:46.72 --> 00:11:48.72
interlaced with leadership capital.

262
00:11:48.72 --> 00:11:53.76
This whole thing is interlaced. So the other ones, when you, when I allow you to

263
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:57.68
reveal something to me, my leadership capital goes up, when I tell you something, my leadership

264
00:11:57.68 --> 00:12:03.28
capital takes a little, takes a little bit of it, not, not thing crazy, but we're not neutral,

265
00:12:03.28 --> 00:12:07.36
right, some of those in the middle might be neutral. So I'm still going to give you an out,

266
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:10.000
you know, when I say, hey, you know, there's other two other companies we're going to

267
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.64
have in the last 18 months and then so maybe we should and I give you some time and out,

268
00:12:14.64 --> 00:12:19.04
you know, maybe we wait another year and I give you some kind of an out where you go, yeah,

269
00:12:19.04 --> 00:12:20.40
you know, that's probably a good idea.

270
00:12:24.08 --> 00:12:27.28
So we're still, we still have a possibility that you kind of see

271
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:31.44
what a good move is and you're kind of on board with what I'm saying, which is what I'm

272
00:12:31.44 --> 00:12:34.16
trying to do this whole time is I'm trying to influence you, right, trying to lead you, trying to

273
00:12:34.16 --> 00:12:39.04
influence you. Then it's just straight up, I'm just going to tell you what the shortfalls are.

274
00:12:41.20 --> 00:12:50.56
And if that doesn't happen, you know, offer them another option, what's another option to

275
00:12:50.56 --> 00:12:57.68
their plan, what's another option to their behavior? You know, hey, maybe putting stores directly in

276
00:12:57.68 --> 00:13:02.72
that neighborhood, how about this one that's, you know, four miles to the north? So yeah, you know,

277
00:13:02.72 --> 00:13:06.56
that's also a good neighbor. So I give you an out, I give you an option that still kind of

278
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:11.76
gratifies your ego and your idea, but at the same time it moves you in a little bit of a direction

279
00:13:11.76 --> 00:13:18.96
where I want to go. So we're still doing all right. And then the kind of the final sort of indirect

280
00:13:18.96 --> 00:13:28.56
way is, you know, a, a, Dave, why don't we put one in this market area over here now and then next time

281
00:13:28.56 --> 00:13:31.76
we'll put one in this marketer that you want to go into. So again, a lot of these are just kind of

282
00:13:31.76 --> 00:13:39.12
bargaining and kind of repetitive, but they're all different levels of bargaining from, hey, we do this

283
00:13:39.12 --> 00:13:44.000
later to, hey, we will do this or we hold off. There's a bunch of different ways to bargain through it.

284
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.44
And then eventually, so now you go through these methods, these attempts to discuss something or

285
00:13:53.44 --> 00:14:00.40
to influence someone and every one of these attempts is an indirect attempt. Every one of these

286
00:14:00.40 --> 00:14:06.48
attempts is me trying to get you to kind of come on board with what I'm saying without,

287
00:14:06.48 --> 00:14:14.40
well, buy your own, buy your own volition. Right. It's your choice that you say, yeah, you know what we

288
00:14:14.40 --> 00:14:19.04
should do this later or yeah, you know what that, my art market area to the north is good. So all those

289
00:14:19.04 --> 00:14:25.36
are your choice, every one of these I'm giving you to you, every one of these attempts, but we

290
00:14:25.36 --> 00:14:33.52
might fail even with all those attempts. And then at some point, you know, so in the Marine Corps,

291
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:37.84
what they do is they go through this whole continuum and then they get eventually to this point

292
00:14:37.84 --> 00:14:42.64
where they cross the threshold of violence. So what does that look like in influence? What does that

293
00:14:42.64 --> 00:14:51.28
look like in leadership? It's the threshold of going from indirect to direct. And now I am absolutely

294
00:14:51.28 --> 00:14:55.04
is going to cost me leadership capital. At this time, I'm now, it's not going to cost me leadership

295
00:14:55.04 --> 00:14:59.36
capital, which hey, look, there's times we have leadership capital in the bank and if I've been

296
00:14:59.36 --> 00:15:04.40
working with Dave for five years and we've done a bunch of stuff and it's all gone great and he's

297
00:15:04.40 --> 00:15:08.64
risen up through the company and all of a sudden I got to call in some chips and say hey man,

298
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:13.52
you know what we're not doing that and he goes, God, you know, I'm not saying it doesn't cost me

299
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:22.24
something but I can afford it. But when you cross the threshold of from indirect to direct,

300
00:15:22.24 --> 00:15:25.76
now it's definitely going to cost you like I said, you might have money in the bank, but you

301
00:15:25.76 --> 00:15:30.32
might have leadership capital in the bank, but it's going to cost you. So now, now is when we're saying hey,

302
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:36.08
you know what, we're going to have to we cannot go into that marketer. Again, this is the most

303
00:15:36.08 --> 00:15:42.80
gent toy to do it. It's we, you know, it's us, it's our team, I'm on your side, you know, we, we can't

304
00:15:42.80 --> 00:15:49.84
go into that market area right now. And you know, then the response could still be, you know,

305
00:15:49.84 --> 00:15:54.64
if Dave's, if Dave's my subordinate and Dave's start, you know, he most people get to say

306
00:15:54.64 --> 00:15:59.92
we can't go into it. Most people get to hit and by the way, we'll get to this. The number of times

307
00:15:59.92 --> 00:16:07.60
that I make it in across the threshold of direct is so, so, so menous, fuel, I can't remember times.

308
00:16:10.64 --> 00:16:15.28
So most people by the same say, like, we cannot do that. We cannot go into that marketer. They go,

309
00:16:15.92 --> 00:16:19.92
joc was got a pretty good, oh, yeah, and they, they feel a little bit of it. They feel that

310
00:16:19.92 --> 00:16:24.32
direct and they immediately say, okay, I got it. I see where, I see where we're going with this. It's not

311
00:16:24.32 --> 00:16:34.08
happening. Of course, sometimes does work, right? Sometimes you say, no, this, this is what we are doing.

312
00:16:34.08 --> 00:16:39.44
We are not going in there. And it can even escalate to no Dave, you cannot open up another store

313
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:46.32
of that. Now, this is direct. This is it. I'm ordering you because I'm the boss. I'm ordering you,

314
00:16:46.32 --> 00:16:51.36
we will not go into that market area. We are not going to build a store there. And then you,

315
00:16:51.36 --> 00:16:55.52
we'll not do that. So this is a direct thing. It's not even me anymore. It's not even us. It's you.

316
00:16:57.84 --> 00:17:04.72
And then what happens after that? What happens after that is now you, now you have to have a

317
00:17:04.72 --> 00:17:08.24
stick, right? Outcomes us because we, we were, we had to care it out for a while.

318
00:17:09.68 --> 00:17:13.36
And some of those bargaining can be carats. Hey, Dave, you know, if you can hold off on that

319
00:17:13.36 --> 00:17:17.12
merit marketer, I'll give you this other marketer over here. That's a carrot. I use that carrot.

320
00:17:17.12 --> 00:17:20.80
I didn't mention it, but yeah, that's another indirect way. If I can draw you away from this

321
00:17:20.80 --> 00:17:27.52
bad area to this other area with a carrot, that's positive. We just got a bunch of intel that this

322
00:17:27.52 --> 00:17:32.32
other market areas really start and ramp up. Why don't you put something there? All of a sudden,

323
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:36.64
you go, oh, yeah, okay, I didn't know that cool. You jump on that carrot. Well, now, when you don't,

324
00:17:36.64 --> 00:17:39.92
when you go through this escalation, now I add some point I have to get out of stick.

325
00:17:39.92 --> 00:17:47.04
And say, if you try and open up something in that market area, I'm actually going to remove you

326
00:17:47.04 --> 00:17:52.48
from that position, or I'm going to dock your pay or whatever the punishment becomes. I'll write

327
00:17:52.48 --> 00:18:00.24
you up, whatever it's going to become. And that's sort of where we get to, you know, theoretically

328
00:18:00.24 --> 00:18:05.28
in the business world of the highest level of escalation is like, I'm going to fire you, right?

329
00:18:05.28 --> 00:18:09.68
If you don't do what I'm telling you to do, you are going to get fired. I'm going to fire you.

330
00:18:10.40 --> 00:18:15.28
And of course, you go outside the business world, you go into the streets as they say. Well,

331
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:20.88
there's the threat of violence comes next, which is, hey, you either get, you either move your

332
00:18:20.88 --> 00:18:26.32
car out of my parking space, or I'm going to punch you in the head. That's a threat of violence.

333
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:32.56
And what happens after that? Violence. I grab you. I put you back in your car, and I, you know,

334
00:18:32.56 --> 00:18:40.000
don't say you better back out of this thing right now. And, and if you really want to take this

335
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.48
to the next level, the ultimate is the, the existential threat, which is if you don't do what I'm

336
00:18:48.48 --> 00:18:53.84
telling you to do, I'm going to kill you. Right? So, so, and it's important to, it's important to

337
00:18:53.84 --> 00:18:59.60
understand what that that's there. And I'll tell you why, because a lot of people, they want to

338
00:18:59.60 --> 00:19:07.52
start. They want to start this, this continuum at the threat. That's where they begin. That's where

339
00:19:07.52 --> 00:19:13.28
they begin with their employees. They start with, this is what you're going to do. That's where they

340
00:19:13.28 --> 00:19:21.04
start. And once, once you, once you cross, here's the thing. So, once you cross that threshold

341
00:19:21.04 --> 00:19:26.24
of director overt, that's another good word, overt leadership. Meaning, I'm telling you exactly,

342
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:30.56
this is totally overt. There's no, there's no influence happening there. It's just me telling

343
00:19:30.56 --> 00:19:37.20
you what's going to happen. And when we do that, when we, when you start out there, you just don't

344
00:19:37.20 --> 00:19:45.68
have anywhere to go. You don't have anywhere else to go. So, the lower you are on the continuum,

345
00:19:48.48 --> 00:19:54.96
the better off you are as a leader. And in fact, in fact, if you go negative, if I go,

346
00:19:54.96 --> 00:19:59.68
if I'm your boss, Dave, and I go negative, and I actually let you influence me. And I say,

347
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:04.24
you know what, Dave, that looks like a great marketer. I had any think of going in there. Let's do it.

348
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:10.32
I'm gaining more, even more leadership capital. So, it's even better if I'm in the negative,

349
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:18.88
if I'm in that other chart where you're actually influencing me. So, if we can do that,

350
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:26.08
then we don't ever have to get to that threshold. And I, like I said, I, the amount of times

351
00:20:26.08 --> 00:20:33.68
I've crossed that threshold in my life from a leadership perspective is freaking tiny. And I'll

352
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:38.32
tell you where let's just start one place that happens all the time. It happens with kids all the time.

353
00:20:38.32 --> 00:20:46.24
Right? Of kids all the time, it's, it's, it's clean your room. Why? Because I said so, there you go.

354
00:20:46.24 --> 00:20:52.72
Yep, you just went right to the, hey, direct over, I'm going to order you what to do,

355
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:59.04
horrible thing to do. What happens with employees? Happens up and down the chain to command.

356
00:20:59.04 --> 00:21:07.44
And here's what's interesting. When you are, when you cross the threshold of,

357
00:21:07.44 --> 00:21:18.08
of direct and you cross the threshold of overt, you, there's a, there's a equal and opposite reaction.

358
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:23.68
Right? So, every time you bark at someone, they, they might do what you said, but there is

359
00:21:23.68 --> 00:21:29.12
an equal and opposite reaction that they are looking for you to fail. They're looking to sabotage

360
00:21:29.12 --> 00:21:33.60
or looking to cause problems. The stronger the order is the more you yell at somebody, the stronger

361
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:41.84
that backlash is going to be. That's the reality of the situation. And a lot of people, a lot of

362
00:21:41.84 --> 00:21:48.16
people need to think about this. So, in the same way that the Marine Corps put together this manual

363
00:21:48.96 --> 00:21:55.92
to let everybody know that there's, that they're competing all the time. You should also know that

364
00:21:55.92 --> 00:22:00.40
there's a continuum that, you're on a continuum of competition all the time. And there's also a

365
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:04.48
continuum of leadership. And by the way, it's up and down the chain of command too. And I'm not

366
00:22:04.48 --> 00:22:09.60
going to like dig deep into this right now. We'll do it later. But when you talk about up the chain of

367
00:22:09.60 --> 00:22:15.36
command, there's a continuum as well. It starts off with just compliance. Dave tells me to do something

368
00:22:15.36 --> 00:22:21.20
he's my boss. Cool. I do it. What's the next level? I question what he's saying. Hey, Dave, why are we doing

369
00:22:21.20 --> 00:22:25.04
that? What's the next level? Hey, Dave, I don't think we should do that. We get some resistance going.

370
00:22:25.04 --> 00:22:31.52
Then we get to objection. This is a bad idea. And then we eventually get to refusal. And then we get to

371
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:36.16
mute and so there's a continuum there as well. And there's some people that start off, you know,

372
00:22:36.16 --> 00:22:40.40
if they don't have a, if they're not thinking strategically, they go right to this, this is still making

373
00:22:40.40 --> 00:22:44.56
sense. That's where they go right to. They're jumping right there. And now all of a sudden, what are

374
00:22:44.56 --> 00:22:47.84
they going to get back? An equal and opposite reaction, which says, shut up and do what I told you to do.

375
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:58.64
So we don't want to go to war. We want to build relationships. We want to build relationships with

376
00:22:58.64 --> 00:23:02.000
other country. We're other nation states. We want to have a relation. We don't want to go to war.

377
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.68
War costs us money and lives. We don't want that. We don't want to go to war with our employees.

378
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:16.64
We don't want to go to war with our teammates. If you recognize this continuum, you can start to say,

379
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:21.60
oh, I see what's going on. I'm escalating. How much am I going to escalate? What's the next

380
00:23:21.60 --> 00:23:28.24
lowest minimum step I could take in my escalation? So that's what we need to do. We need to pay attention

381
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:37.36
of that. I don't have to do this. I can barely think of times when I've had to do this.

382
00:23:38.96 --> 00:23:43.84
And why is because I listen up one other people have to say, I dig in. I mean, I don't dig into

383
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:48.64
my position. I don't think my position is infinitely better than yours. I think probably if you

384
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:53.92
and I both want to kill bad guys and win the war, our ideas are going to be pretty close. I think

385
00:23:53.92 --> 00:24:00.24
if we both want to take care of our clients and make profit, our ideas are going to be pretty close.

386
00:24:00.24 --> 00:24:05.52
They're going to be pretty close. Close enough that I can be fairly agreeable with whatever it is

387
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:13.44
someone else wants to do. But it's a continuum that we have to pay attention to just like

388
00:24:13.44 --> 00:24:22.24
competing. What do you got Dave? You're over there taking notes. I was just thinking,

389
00:24:22.24 --> 00:24:26.80
I mean, I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm making the connection and you're using

390
00:24:26.80 --> 00:24:32.16
examples that I actually get to live. I lived in the military, but I get to live that now too,

391
00:24:32.16 --> 00:24:34.88
because I've released the clients we work with. I've released ships inside of the Shlon

392
00:24:34.88 --> 00:24:40.32
front. I've released ships at different ways, even with you and there are times that you and

393
00:24:40.32 --> 00:24:44.000
are working together. There are times that you're helping me, almost in a support role with

394
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.68
the client and there's times that you're the CEO of the company. I'm running one of the departments.

395
00:24:49.20 --> 00:24:53.20
As you're talking about that, I'm picturing this continuum. Where's the threat of violence?

396
00:24:53.20 --> 00:24:59.12
Where does physical violence or where does war come in? The more you make deposits or the more

397
00:24:59.12 --> 00:25:06.96
you take the indirect approach, the more you get to keep doing that and the more you go to the

398
00:25:06.96 --> 00:25:13.36
direct threat, the more you have to use that. And just the idea of the recognition is that

399
00:25:14.08 --> 00:25:18.56
and I'm just thinking of those terms of the more indirect you are. The more leadership deposits I make,

400
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:24.40
the more that's the technique I get to use, because the more I let you influence me, the more

401
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:27.84
likely you're going to be doing the things you want to do that help us get to the end state. And I never

402
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:32.48
have to, I never have to move down that, that almost never have to move down that continuum. I'm

403
00:25:32.48 --> 00:25:38.88
trying to think of a time where I'm trying to think of a time where you had to escalate in a way that

404
00:25:38.88 --> 00:25:45.52
I recognized. And I've been working for years. Now, I'm not saying that that hasn't happened.

405
00:25:45.52 --> 00:25:49.52
I'm not saying that the escalation hasn't occurred, but it's, I can't think of a time where I went,

406
00:25:49.52 --> 00:25:56.16
oh, damn, I kind of, I kind of pushed him up the stair step. So it has been subtle enough. The

407
00:25:56.16 --> 00:26:01.52
times, however many times has happened, but the reason it works, even those subtle escalations,

408
00:26:01.52 --> 00:26:07.12
the reason they work is because that's the technique you always use. So the idea of the threat of

409
00:26:07.12 --> 00:26:12.56
violence, especially if that's your first move, it's so limiting. It gives you so few options after

410
00:26:12.56 --> 00:26:18.56
that, that it's such a bad, it's not a bad first move. It's even a bad six or seventh one. I think

411
00:26:18.56 --> 00:26:24.40
there's this idea that there are so many things. And I think the part that has leaders that I want to

412
00:26:24.40 --> 00:26:29.44
avoid war as well, even if I'm the boss, even if I'm in charge, it's not what I want. And I think

413
00:26:29.44 --> 00:26:33.20
the way you close it was, is this because the equal and opposite reaction. And this satisfaction of

414
00:26:33.20 --> 00:26:38.72
knowing you're going to win is not should not be enough to make, and as a parent makes the most sense.

415
00:26:38.72 --> 00:26:42.24
I know I'm going to win that worth my get. If I tell my kid to clean his room, because I said so,

416
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:48.16
he is going to clean his room. What a great victory. What a win. Yeah. And, and yeah,

417
00:26:48.16 --> 00:26:54.08
for how long until the reaction from him becomes so big and so violent that I lose all influence

418
00:26:54.08 --> 00:27:03.04
over him. Yeah, the other thing is, as I brush up against, hey, well, maybe it's the time.

419
00:27:03.84 --> 00:27:08.88
Maybe it's the time to go direct in this situation. Most of the time, after way that against,

420
00:27:08.88 --> 00:27:13.44
okay, well, what does that get me strategically? Right? Where does that get me strategically? If I've

421
00:27:13.44 --> 00:27:19.28
got to say, you know what Dave, you need to do it this way from now on. I want you to use this

422
00:27:19.28 --> 00:27:27.20
font on the power points, right? Whatever thing you want to come up with. Where does that get me strategically?

423
00:27:27.20 --> 00:27:30.24
All you have to do is take one step back and say, wait a second, where does that get me strategically?

424
00:27:30.24 --> 00:27:34.56
Does that improve my relationship with Dave? Does this make him want to do a better job? Does this,

425
00:27:34.56 --> 00:27:39.04
like you just have to take one step back and you, oh, yeah, this is dumb. This is a dumb move.

426
00:27:39.04 --> 00:27:45.20
What I should do is be a better influencer, have a better relationship, explain myself better,

427
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:50.48
do some bargaining, talk about it, maybe I'm wrong, maybe the font that he's using is actually

428
00:27:50.48 --> 00:27:58.80
better for these and and by the way, has he picked a font that's eligible? Right? Has he picked a

429
00:27:58.80 --> 00:28:05.60
font that's eligible? Is it, is it, Cyrillic? Is that the right word? I don't know. Cyrillic, is that

430
00:28:05.60 --> 00:28:11.28
the right word? Like the Russian? Yeah, is he picked a font that is illegible in English? Right?

431
00:28:11.28 --> 00:28:16.32
And then then I kind of have to make a stand, but if it's legible, if people can read it,

432
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:21.76
why am I freaking out? The answer is I'm stupid. I want to waste my leadership capital

433
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:26.80
on something that doesn't matter. But by the way, up and down the chain of command, because if I

434
00:28:26.80 --> 00:28:30.96
said, hey, Dave, what do you think of that font? You know what you'd say to me? You're like,

435
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:34.16
well, I've been using it, but what does it not look good? And I'd say, well, I don't know,

436
00:28:34.16 --> 00:28:38.48
it's a little bit unclear from a distance. You'd say, oh, I'm going to fall on my sword about

437
00:28:38.48 --> 00:28:43.84
this font. No, you'd actually say, oh, which one have you been using? And I'd say, oh, I've been using

438
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:51.52
aerial because it has sharp edges, which I like. And you'd say, hmm, oh, click down, drop, drop the

439
00:28:51.52 --> 00:28:56.56
menu, there's aerial, you click on it. Yeah, you're right. That does look pretty good, Joco.

440
00:28:56.56 --> 00:29:01.36
And I go, gee, thank you. And you say, you know what, I'm going to change all my briefs to aerial.

441
00:29:01.92 --> 00:29:08.40
Because just vice versa, I'm not sitting here telling you, use Cyrillic fonts that can't be read,

442
00:29:08.40 --> 00:29:17.68
by English speaking humans. So you're, so what do we do? I'm offering a little suggestion,

443
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:22.32
and you're going, oh, yeah, that's a great suggestion. My leadership capital went up,

444
00:29:22.32 --> 00:29:28.000
your leadership capital went up. It's a beautiful thing. Or we can have World War VII about a font.

445
00:29:29.44 --> 00:29:37.20
It's such a tactical loss for you to say, it's, first of all, to tackle a loss from you to say,

446
00:29:37.20 --> 00:29:40.80
you need to change this font. This, you need to use aerial because that's what I use.

447
00:29:41.36 --> 00:29:48.16
Yeah, okay. Great. Oh, hey, by the way, it's different. That font's different on other systems.

448
00:29:48.16 --> 00:29:53.12
And now all of it looks like just a horrible thing. If you're smart, you go, hey, oh, you like

449
00:29:53.12 --> 00:30:02.000
air, cool. Got it. We're moving forward. Be surprised. Be surprised. All right,

450
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:10.16
it's interesting, isn't it? It's interesting, how you kind of use the pan fidgeting example

451
00:30:10.80 --> 00:30:16.24
on Dave over here, but you literally did me like that. Did I really? Yeah, we have it. Remember,

452
00:30:16.24 --> 00:30:22.32
I was clicking the pan. Yeah, there's on online. Oh, you need to post it there. And you,

453
00:30:22.32 --> 00:30:28.24
I did post it. I know what I said. I said, do you think the Mike picks up that noise? Yeah,

454
00:30:28.24 --> 00:30:33.84
do you think the Mike's? And you know what you said? You said no. I don't think so. But you didn't

455
00:30:33.84 --> 00:30:39.52
begin. No. But then you kind of clicked it a couple times while we were just quiet. And you know what you heard?

456
00:30:39.52 --> 00:30:45.04
Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, and then I laughed. Yeah. And I did, it was weird.

457
00:30:45.04 --> 00:30:50.08
It kind of was, it was almost like in not slow motion, but kind of like I could slowly,

458
00:30:50.80 --> 00:30:56.000
within the span of our would say maybe six seconds, I slowly picked up on what you're doing there.

459
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.56
Like why you said it like that? Like you're saying, hey, stop doing the clicking. Just stop clicking.

460
00:31:00.56 --> 00:31:06.08
You, that's what you're saying. And but you said it in this way. Hey, do you think that that's

461
00:31:06.08 --> 00:31:09.68
going to have end the way the tone, everything like you could tell you knew what you're doing with

462
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:16.80
the way you delivered that question. Here's the, here's the no kidding. The, the no kidding. When I

463
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:20.64
asked you that question, I was earnestly asking that question. Like, do you think that's going to show

464
00:31:20.64 --> 00:31:26.56
up? Now, it's an earnest question. Do you think that clicking is going to show up on this podcast?

465
00:31:27.36 --> 00:31:31.04
It's an earnest question. I probably had a pretty good suspicion because I can freaking hear it through

466
00:31:31.04 --> 00:31:37.12
my headphones for 15 minutes. But you got to detach from those emotions. And you got to ask

467
00:31:37.12 --> 00:31:40.88
an earnest question because maybe if it's not going to show up, why am I worried about it?

468
00:31:40.88 --> 00:31:44.40
I'm not going to let it, I'm not going to let it bother me. If it's not going to show up,

469
00:31:44.40 --> 00:31:48.96
it's not going to be on the audio, then who cares? I'm not going to care about that. If you want to

470
00:31:48.96 --> 00:31:52.32
click your panel all day, cool. It's not bothering me. It's not going to be on the, we're good.

471
00:31:52.32 --> 00:31:58.56
So it's an earnest question. But I mean, it's, it's, we did know the answer. Yeah. Kind of,

472
00:31:58.56 --> 00:32:03.52
because we can hear it. You know, it's kind of interesting. We'll say, because you know, I did

473
00:32:03.52 --> 00:32:08.000
kind of say, no, I don't think so. I forget exactly what I said. We'll get the replay. Yeah. But I

474
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.48
feel like if I remember correctly, I was kind of, at least at the very least, implied that, like,

475
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:17.92
no, no, no, it's all good. Almost. For just for a split second, though, your thing is that was a

476
00:32:17.92 --> 00:32:24.16
version of me, like defensively. I was about to say that was that was an instinctual defense.

477
00:32:24.16 --> 00:32:29.60
It's instinctual. Exactly. Like that instinctual defense. Yeah. Yeah. And then, but I was so,

478
00:32:29.60 --> 00:32:36.40
it was so not, like, just natural. Yeah. But it was so not called for, like, on a, like, a primal

479
00:32:36.40 --> 00:32:40.88
level. If you were, like, it was so not called for that. I felt that it was so not called for,

480
00:32:40.88 --> 00:32:46.56
and I don't, I don't have to dig in on this. Clicking the pan. Let's face it. Like, I know that it's,

481
00:32:46.56 --> 00:32:51.04
like, a habit. You know, I mean, clicking bends to have it. And then what made it additionally

482
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:55.60
interesting, just a little teeny tiny interaction was that, I was like, oh, man, I do it, like,

483
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.60
I got a habit, right? There's the excuses, like, trying to explain, like, I do how to have it.

484
00:32:59.60 --> 00:33:03.28
And then, instead of you saying, mirror those two excuses or whatever, you were just like,

485
00:33:03.28 --> 00:33:07.84
oh, and then you grabbed, like, the nearest non-clicking pan and just simply gave me some

486
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:15.28
bargaining. Red option. That's, that's the carrot, right? The carrot, like, oh, maybe

487
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:22.000
do you get your attention from that? Yeah, there you go. Perfect. You know, the, the things that fall into

488
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.36
the category of indirect and direct, like the techniques you can use can actually, I was thinking

489
00:33:27.36 --> 00:33:32.72
about that conversation can actually change. If early in a relationship or relationship that doesn't

490
00:33:32.72 --> 00:33:36.16
have a lot of mutual respect or you don't have any of that leadership capital built,

491
00:33:36.88 --> 00:33:42.16
you can say, hey, Dave, don't, don't click your pan. And I'd be like, okay, I probably comply,

492
00:33:42.16 --> 00:33:47.12
but am I mine? I like, dude, what's the deal? And I, I might have that natural, that little reaction,

493
00:33:47.12 --> 00:33:51.12
that little ego hit, and then that little resistance, or even maybe little resentment,

494
00:33:51.12 --> 00:33:55.28
whatever it is. And this is a small example, but it would fit in the category of direct.

495
00:33:55.28 --> 00:34:01.60
I don't naturally like that. But over time, if you've actually done the things you're just talking

496
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:07.76
about, and you've built enough capital, what falls as indirect or influence, that actually can

497
00:34:07.76 --> 00:34:11.60
expand. You can say to me, right now, hey, don't click that pan. And I'm going to have no

498
00:34:11.60 --> 00:34:14.88
reaction to it. Because I'm going to think, oh, he's only telling me that for my own benefit,

499
00:34:14.88 --> 00:34:19.04
for the benefit of the body. I'm not going to have that reaction, so that what appears to be a

500
00:34:19.04 --> 00:34:23.12
direct that you're saying something directly to me, I don't even register that as a direct,

501
00:34:23.12 --> 00:34:28.000
and that actually fits in the category of, at a minimum, there's no withdrawal there. So even

502
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.60
the things that you do as little as they are, the options for indirect leadership actually

503
00:34:33.60 --> 00:34:37.36
can grow. Things that would normally be outside there, where I would have some sort of problem

504
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:44.000
with you saying that, where I think, a mustard three, and you go, hey, when you're doing Q&A,

505
00:34:45.04 --> 00:34:49.52
you say, I think you said something like, you say, in between, don't do that anymore.

506
00:34:50.64 --> 00:34:58.64
And the way you said it didn't bother me at all. But it could be that if you have that conversation

507
00:34:58.64 --> 00:35:02.56
with somebody, and you don't have any leadership capital, they might not like that. So you

508
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:07.60
being able to say that to me is a function of the trust that we have, the influence that we shared,

509
00:35:07.60 --> 00:35:11.20
and the amount of leadership capital, you have that you can actually kind of be direct,

510
00:35:11.60 --> 00:35:15.36
and it doesn't bother me that it would, in a way that it would, had just come at, you know,

511
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:19.84
day one, we're like, I don't like the way you talk, do it differently. And I'm not going to like that,

512
00:35:19.84 --> 00:35:24.64
no matter who I am. So even what you can do, what you can get away with in a sense of what is still

513
00:35:24.64 --> 00:35:31.60
a leadership capital deposit, that will grow as well. Yeah, that's, that's why it's all

514
00:35:31.60 --> 00:35:37.20
interlaced with leadership capital. Because if you start off day one by saying, I don't like the

515
00:35:37.20 --> 00:35:43.28
way you talk, that's, you use went into a deficit immediately. And now you got to dig your way out of that.

516
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:47.76
That's why it's totally interlaced with leadership capital. Because the more leadership capital you have,

517
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.76
the more when you need to now, if I said, hey, Dave, you're saying, oh, when you talk and hey,

518
00:35:53.76 --> 00:35:58.08
Dave, this answer was bad and hey, Dave, the way you presented this, your slides were all,

519
00:35:58.08 --> 00:36:02.96
they didn't look good and hate. And I just started everything was negative. Well, I'm going to

520
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:06.64
eventually going to run out of leadership capital and start going in a bad way. And you're, you're out of

521
00:36:06.64 --> 00:36:12.80
two, just, all chocolate does is just tell me what I do wrong. And I guess I can't do anything right.

522
00:36:12.80 --> 00:36:16.000
And I guess I just don't even need to be here. And I think you go look for another job. It's just,

523
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.72
you know, because I've, I've expended all my leadership capital. So it's completely intertwined with

524
00:36:20.72 --> 00:36:27.28
leadership capital, completely intertwined with leadership capital. But just like, you know, I said this on

525
00:36:27.28 --> 00:36:31.92
EF online the other day, I people usually think they have more leadership capital than they do.

526
00:36:32.48 --> 00:36:39.04
They usually think they're just rolling deep in in in leadership capital in their own little heads.

527
00:36:39.04 --> 00:36:49.36
They think, of course. So I always kind of treat every situation as if, okay, you know, I'm,

528
00:36:49.36 --> 00:36:53.60
I'm lean. I'm running lean. It's going to be lean Christmas. That's my parents used to tell me.

529
00:36:53.60 --> 00:36:59.44
It's going to be lean Christmas. So I always think, I don't have leadership capital to spare because

530
00:36:59.44 --> 00:37:04.96
also what if I really need leadership capital tomorrow? What if tomorrow? I go, hey, Dave,

531
00:37:06.40 --> 00:37:12.88
I know it's your, your anniversary, your tenure anniversary, your 20 year anniversary, whatever. And I know

532
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:16.80
that you're supposed to go to the mountains with your life for three days. And we just had a

533
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:23.12
client call and you now have to go to Oklahoma to talk to them. And I might have to do that.

534
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:28.80
Tomorrow. And that's the way it is. So am I really, how much, how, where do I want that account?

535
00:37:29.52 --> 00:37:33.28
Right. I want that account to be as built up as I possibly can. So that means I'm not going to waste

536
00:37:33.28 --> 00:37:38.000
leadership capital on little things that don't matter. Not going to happen. Yeah. That's why the default

537
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.64
no matter where you are should almost always be almost always be on that side of the default should be on

538
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:47.60
that side of this spectrum. Yeah. And it's weird too because you have the, you have the threshold of violence,

539
00:37:47.60 --> 00:37:55.20
we have the, on the continuum, on the war continuum, on the competing continuum, there's a

540
00:37:55.20 --> 00:38:00.16
threshold of violence. There's actual real violence with with influencing people. Like you have to

541
00:38:00.16 --> 00:38:04.96
admit that that you can push people around and you can smack them and you can beat them up. That's

542
00:38:04.96 --> 00:38:11.28
a, there's a, there's a threshold of violence on the, on the influence on the influence continuum.

543
00:38:11.28 --> 00:38:16.80
Before that, there's, there's a one between direct and indirect. So you cross that one, which is

544
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:21.36
a huge one. That's like the big one. Yeah. Now, of course, I guess the threshold of violence is a

545
00:38:21.36 --> 00:38:28.24
big one too on influence because now you're getting charged with a salt or murder or murder, depending on

546
00:38:28.24 --> 00:38:32.96
what level of violence you took a deal of. So it's important to think about these things.

547
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.60
And with that, we're going to jump into this, this, this whole thing, man. I mean, I just like,

548
00:38:41.60 --> 00:38:46.72
I've just been thinking about this nonstop, which is pretty normal for me to think about these

549
00:38:46.72 --> 00:38:55.44
things, nonstop. So competing for US Marine Corps brand new manual one tack for it's called

550
00:38:55.44 --> 00:39:00.08
competing last last time we covered chapter one this time we're covering chapter two. This one's

551
00:39:00.08 --> 00:39:06.24
chapter two is called the theory of competition. And it says competition as an active policy

552
00:39:07.20 --> 00:39:12.96
as states engage in competition or try to shape the competitions on going among the range of

553
00:39:12.96 --> 00:39:19.68
state and nonstate actors involved in areas of interest to states they develop policies frame

554
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:25.20
to frame order and apply resources to this activity. Marines need to understand policy,

555
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:32.64
how it's developed and how it relates to ongoing competition. My little note here just says,

556
00:39:32.64 --> 00:39:39.76
what are you doing? This is me making notes to myself, what are you doing? What are you doing? Where are

557
00:39:39.76 --> 00:39:46.64
you at? Do you know what your what competition are you in? You know, I had a it was an early

558
00:39:46.64 --> 00:39:50.48
part, it was a pretty early podcast, I don't know which one, but when I started talking about

559
00:39:50.48 --> 00:39:57.84
what game are you playing and and you can be playing the wrong game with your life and if you're

560
00:39:57.84 --> 00:40:03.04
looking up and you're like, man, I'm doing everything I can but I just I'm not putting any points on the

561
00:40:03.04 --> 00:40:08.40
board. Well, if you're playing soccer, you might not be putting any points on the board because there's

562
00:40:08.40 --> 00:40:15.84
only one goal a game or three, maybe you should be playing basketball, we can score 48 points again.

563
00:40:17.44 --> 00:40:21.84
So with this competition, what are you competing in? And who are you competing against?

564
00:40:23.84 --> 00:40:28.40
Goes on, Marines are frequently asked to provide input to policymakers as they deliberate.

565
00:40:29.28 --> 00:40:35.84
Understanding the larger context around policy decisions helps Marines determine the broader

566
00:40:35.84 --> 00:40:43.12
intent behind specific decisions which in turn helps us make sound supporting plants. What does

567
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:48.24
that mean? Everyone should know why they're doing what they're doing. Like war, Marines should

568
00:40:48.24 --> 00:40:55.36
think of competition as serving policy. Since we acknowledge competition as an enduring condition,

569
00:40:56.72 --> 00:41:01.36
that's a great, that's a great phrase, one would adopt that one, enduring condition. It's just

570
00:41:01.36 --> 00:41:07.92
ongoing. It's forever. In internal relations, then we need to take equally and equally long

571
00:41:07.92 --> 00:41:12.48
view when it comes to policy as well. US vital interests have remained relatively stable over time.

572
00:41:12.48 --> 00:41:16.48
For example, since World War II, they've been framed in various ways while consistently calling

573
00:41:16.48 --> 00:41:21.44
for the maintenance of our constitutional values, protection of the American homeland and people,

574
00:41:21.44 --> 00:41:25.84
promotion of American prosperity and the advancement of the American influence in the world.

575
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:32.96
The contemporary environment will affect these specifics of policy, but the enduring

576
00:41:32.96 --> 00:41:38.48
foundation for it consists of stable interests such as these. So what, what the reason I

577
00:41:38.48 --> 00:41:42.48
and again, sometimes I look like, oh, we can kind of breathe over this part. No, I know you can't.

578
00:41:43.36 --> 00:41:48.08
Because if you, if you think about your life, okay, you can think about your business for sure.

579
00:41:48.08 --> 00:41:53.12
What is it that your business is trying to do? Like do you think a Marine wakes up in the morning and says,

580
00:41:53.12 --> 00:41:57.44
okay, today I'm going to maintain our, the maintain our constitutional values.

581
00:41:57.44 --> 00:42:01.04
Is he saying, all right, I've got to protect the American homeland. People, we kind of, we kind of

582
00:42:01.04 --> 00:42:05.44
know that one promotion of American prosperity. So there's these, there's these things. They're

583
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:12.24
so big, such big strategic goals that they shape every decision that you make. They should

584
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:17.60
the advancement of American influence around the world. If a Marine goes out and does something

585
00:42:17.60 --> 00:42:25.36
stupid in name a foreign country goes out and acts like gun to get strong and act like an idiot,

586
00:42:25.36 --> 00:42:28.000
has he helped the advancement of American influence in the world? No, he hasn't.

587
00:42:29.68 --> 00:42:34.48
And that's what he's going to hear from his commanding officer. You just made all Marines

588
00:42:34.48 --> 00:42:38.48
to look bad and you just made America look bad by getting drunk and getting a fighter,

589
00:42:38.48 --> 00:42:45.04
whatever you did that will stupid. And that Marine can't deny that. He says, Roger Sir,

590
00:42:45.04 --> 00:42:50.80
it was a bad move. If that Marine would have been thinking a little bit more strategic,

591
00:42:51.52 --> 00:42:56.000
maybe he would have maintained a little bit more level ahead on the bears. You know, I had a Marine

592
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.36
one time. I was on a ship. I was on a ship and look, we know we know that I love the Marine

593
00:43:03.36 --> 00:43:09.68
corps. I was on a ship. And when you'd pull and to port, you have to get in line to get off the

594
00:43:09.68 --> 00:43:13.36
ship. And sometimes it take an hour or two hours. So what we would do is we'd work out,

595
00:43:13.36 --> 00:43:18.88
as soon as we got, as soon as we hit the pier, we would work out. This is like 1990, whatever.

596
00:43:19.52 --> 00:43:24.000
We'd hit the pier, work out. And by the time we got done working out, took a shower,

597
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.04
then you could just walk right off the ship because all the Marines were already gone. So once

598
00:43:27.04 --> 00:43:30.72
time I did that, like me and my buddies, we got, we hit the pier, we start working out,

599
00:43:30.72 --> 00:43:34.48
we get done working out, take a shower. It's been an hour and a half. We come walking up to leave.

600
00:43:35.20 --> 00:43:40.80
So these guys have been off the ship without that. They are carrying a young Marine back on the ship,

601
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:48.64
just completely brain dead from alcohol. So, you gotta be careful out there.

602
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:54.80
But so, so when you look at, if you look at the Marine corps has these kind of broad things that

603
00:43:54.80 --> 00:44:00.000
they're saying, this is what we're doing. What do you have in your life? What do you have in your business?

604
00:44:00.72 --> 00:44:04.80
What do you have in your business? Okay, just like that young Marine, if he's lead well,

605
00:44:04.80 --> 00:44:10.32
he's going to say, you know what? The home Marine Corps is relying on me to make America look

606
00:44:10.32 --> 00:44:18.96
good. God, that's sort of good Marine is going to say. If you're running a business and you've got

607
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:23.44
a cashier, I've been using cashiers a lot because you know why? Because they're front line and

608
00:44:23.44 --> 00:44:28.08
they're interacting with people. If you've got a cashier that treats a customer bad, he's making

609
00:44:28.08 --> 00:44:31.68
the whole company look bad. If you doesn't know that, okay, and then what about your life?

610
00:44:31.68 --> 00:44:36.56
What are you trying to do in your life? What are you trying to, where are you trying to go with your

611
00:44:36.56 --> 00:44:44.96
life? What's the broad, what's the broad strategic mark that you're trying to make? Do you have one?

612
00:44:45.92 --> 00:44:52.72
Do you have one? And if you don't have one, how are you making decisions? You're making decisions

613
00:44:52.72 --> 00:45:04.24
for with no, with no steering whatsoever, without a compass. So these are enduring interests.

614
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:10.72
And during interest provide Marines a potential source of competitive advantage.

615
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.32
At hearing to our values, when done as part of a comprehensive strategy,

616
00:45:16.32 --> 00:45:22.64
you can serve to attract others and work in harmony with Marines with what Marines learned from

617
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:29.28
an early age. Value such as freedom of expression and press freedom can help frustrate the plans

618
00:45:29.28 --> 00:45:35.76
of some competitors. Positive some interests such as increasing American prosperity also help

619
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:42.72
attract allies and partners. This is especially true when we can show how our interests align

620
00:45:42.72 --> 00:45:50.000
with theirs. And that interesting. If we can work together, we're going to be better off. We're

621
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.96
stronger together. We're stronger together than we are fighting each other.

622
00:45:52.96 --> 00:46:03.92
Domestic politics affects the policy decisions of almost all competitors and the resulting

623
00:46:03.92 --> 00:46:13.92
character of all nearly all competitions. Everything you do, everything you do impacts,

624
00:46:13.92 --> 00:46:19.84
the competitors and the competition itself. As mentioned in chapter one,

625
00:46:19.84 --> 00:46:23.68
there are often multiple centers of power in each nation and the struggle amongst them often

626
00:46:23.68 --> 00:46:28.80
creates ambiguity in the minds of outside observers. These struggles affect internal politics and

627
00:46:28.80 --> 00:46:33.60
often drive or limit current policy choices. This is true in the United States. For example,

628
00:46:33.60 --> 00:46:38.72
when we see the deliberations on national policy among three co-equal branches of the government,

629
00:46:38.72 --> 00:46:43.68
in other less open societies, domestic considerations have major impact on policy,

630
00:46:43.68 --> 00:46:48.000
even though these considerations are often harder for outsiders to understand.

631
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.48
This happens in businesses a lot. You've got some people with different ideas of how we're

632
00:46:52.48 --> 00:46:56.64
going to get where we're going, sometimes unfortunately, even disagree on where they're going,

633
00:46:56.64 --> 00:47:03.28
which is bad. And that's something with all the political mayhem that we're facing in America right now.

634
00:47:03.92 --> 00:47:09.68
I guess maybe mayhem's well, with what we're facing right now, we'll just call it. We want

635
00:47:09.68 --> 00:47:16.48
put a, we don't want to sign a word to it because different people will sign at different words.

636
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:28.48
We'll say that there's disagreements in America right? But this is what, this is a democracy

637
00:47:28.48 --> 00:47:36.000
is going to be messy, but you're going to get a better result in the end. So if you, if you

638
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.68
have a platoon where, hey, I'm going to take input from the troops, so they're going to let me know

639
00:47:41.68 --> 00:47:44.24
and sometimes they're going to argue with me about some stuff and not argue, but we're going to

640
00:47:44.24 --> 00:47:47.68
disagree about some things. Now, if it turns into an argument, we start fighting, that's bad.

641
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:53.20
But for, for my point, man, to say, hey, Joc, I don't think that's a good route to get into the

642
00:47:53.20 --> 00:47:56.72
target. And me to say, well, why not? And for us to have a discussion about that's totally

643
00:47:56.72 --> 00:47:59.76
positive thing. I want to come to a better conclusion. That's what's supposed to happen in democracy.

644
00:48:00.48 --> 00:48:05.84
We have a discussion, but we're both trying to get to the target. My point, man, once to get there,

645
00:48:05.84 --> 00:48:12.80
I want to get there. In America, we've got, what are we trying to do? We've got a hope that we are

646
00:48:12.80 --> 00:48:20.32
aligned enough that we say, oh, we want our economy to get better. Okay, can anyone, is anyone disagree

647
00:48:20.32 --> 00:48:25.12
with that? All right, maybe we disagree on how we get there, but at least we have this one thing

648
00:48:25.12 --> 00:48:31.20
that we know we're moving towards. And you can say that, about what do we want? There to be

649
00:48:31.20 --> 00:48:35.76
poverty in the country. Does anyone that says, yeah, well, I really think we need in America's

650
00:48:35.76 --> 00:48:39.68
more poverty? No, no one's saying that. There's not one person that's saying we need more poverty

651
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:45.44
in America. So no matter who you are, you're saying, yep, you know what, we don't want poverty.

652
00:48:45.44 --> 00:48:49.76
We want less poverty. Great. Now, you might think we get there one way. Someone else thinks you

653
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:53.36
get there. Another way. Okay, let's figure out what those things are. And then we can discuss

654
00:48:53.36 --> 00:48:58.16
how we get there. But it's okay if we disagree, because we're just trying to find the best solution.

655
00:48:58.72 --> 00:49:03.60
And when Dave's solution is different to me than me than how we get to the target, and he's the

656
00:49:03.60 --> 00:49:08.32
point, man. And I say, shut up, we're going my way. And he goes, no, we're not that stupid. And now,

657
00:49:08.32 --> 00:49:13.60
we're in a fist fight. Our platoon is falling apart. So what we do is we listen to each other.

658
00:49:13.60 --> 00:49:19.36
And we look for the best possible solution. And maybe, you know, as you, I always try and just agree

659
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:24.80
with the other person. What does that mean? Does that mean I just always bow down and say, oh,

660
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:28.80
you know what, Dave, you know, I can't make a new decision. So we're going with the Dave says, no,

661
00:49:29.36 --> 00:49:33.76
because Dave wants to go one way that I think is going to take an extra 15 minutes.

662
00:49:33.76 --> 00:49:40.88
The route that Dave chooses as the point man is going to take an extra 15 minutes. So you know what,

663
00:49:40.88 --> 00:49:45.52
we're not doing it that way. We have a seven hour patrol. My way is going to take seven hours.

664
00:49:45.52 --> 00:49:52.16
Dave's way is going to take seven hours and 15 minutes. We're doing my way. No, actually, Dave,

665
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:56.48
you know what, your way sounds great. Why? Because I already said, I just, I just in that moment,

666
00:49:56.48 --> 00:50:02.56
I saved 30 minutes of you and I arguing about it. And now we can focus on something more important.

667
00:50:02.56 --> 00:50:07.76
And by the way, we're still getting to the target. And by the way, there's so many unknowns on that route

668
00:50:07.76 --> 00:50:11.76
that I don't know and you don't know. And no one can know. And so I'm actually arguing about something

669
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:16.08
that I have no idea where the landmines, where is the, what is the actual terrain like, what,

670
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:20.000
how tall is that little cliff that I see? Is that something we can get up or do you need to

671
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.16
bring ropes? And also, it takes 45 minutes just to get up that little thing. We got to carry extra gear.

672
00:50:24.16 --> 00:50:29.84
I don't know any of that. So guess what? Am I going to argue with you for 15 minutes of

673
00:50:29.84 --> 00:50:35.60
difference? No. Sounds good, Dave. So why don't I have to, why can I let Dave do whatever,

674
00:50:35.60 --> 00:50:40.32
why can I almost always say I'm going to go with someone else's plan? Because I work with Dave

675
00:50:40.32 --> 00:50:47.52
for long enough. And by the way, I actually taught Dave land navigation. So when Dave comes to me,

676
00:50:47.52 --> 00:50:51.52
and he says, hey, here's how I think we should go. There's a 98% chance that it's pretty freaking

677
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:55.04
close to what I would do in the first place. And by the way, either way, we still get to the target,

678
00:50:55.04 --> 00:51:06.56
which is where we're going. Back to the book. For United States Marines,

679
00:51:06.56 --> 00:51:12.08
understanding current policy relies in part on understanding the interplay between domestic

680
00:51:12.08 --> 00:51:17.28
politics and our enduring vital national interests. Shouldn't everyone just kind of have

681
00:51:17.28 --> 00:51:22.88
enduring vital interests for their family, for their business, for their life? Shouldn't we all

682
00:51:22.88 --> 00:51:29.92
have those things? Yes, we should. As a nation, yes, we should. As specs of domestic politics,

683
00:51:29.92 --> 00:51:36.000
like the election cycle and contemporary societal issues affect current policy, these aspects are typically

684
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.64
felt by Marines through such things, resourcing decisions, guidance on the composition of the

685
00:51:40.64 --> 00:51:47.84
force and specific direction to focus, particular national interests or particular competitors.

686
00:51:47.84 --> 00:51:53.52
You should know the story about what's going on. That whole thing right there, hey,

687
00:51:53.52 --> 00:52:00.000
Corporal Smith that just heard me read that that said, hey, bro, I'm not I'm not I'm not tracking.

688
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:06.24
What this means is you need to know it's just just understand what's happening in the world.

689
00:52:06.24 --> 00:52:09.68
And understanding that what's happening in the world is going to sort of guide what the Marine

690
00:52:09.68 --> 00:52:18.08
Corps is doing. International competition, particularly among nations, plays out over a long timeline.

691
00:52:18.08 --> 00:52:24.48
Oh, what timeline is that? Life. Pursuing the goals put forth by the Constitution and its

692
00:52:24.48 --> 00:52:29.20
amendments has been an enduring vital interest to the United States since the day became effective in

693
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:36.72
1789. This contrast with our desire to bring war to a conclusion as quickly as possible.

694
00:52:36.72 --> 00:52:46.16
Marines need to understand this distinction. Competitive advantage.

695
00:52:47.68 --> 00:52:52.72
Advantage is relative to a competitor when one actor is able to do something better than its

696
00:52:52.72 --> 00:53:01.60
rival or rivals. Check, we get that. What's a corporal terminal lance? That's sort of,

697
00:53:01.60 --> 00:53:07.52
that's, we should be using terminal lance. That guy's legit. Terminal lance is a

698
00:53:07.52 --> 00:53:12.56
he's a cartoon. And he's always actually a whole book too. Terminal lance props.

699
00:53:15.12 --> 00:53:18.80
A business enjoys, it's interesting. Here we go back to a business. A business enjoys competitive

700
00:53:18.80 --> 00:53:22.64
advantage when it can sell a product at a lower price than other businesses, assuming other factors

701
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:27.04
like quality stay the same. Nations also have relative competitive advantages, also referred to

702
00:53:27.04 --> 00:53:32.24
as comparative advantages. Historically, the innovative culture in the United States helped

703
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:37.44
bring it new goods and services to the international marketplace faster than others. The cost

704
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:42.40
of labor in some countries is lower than others, which makes them more attractive for labor intensive

705
00:53:42.40 --> 00:53:47.44
manufacturing businesses. It follows then that we must understand our potential rivals if we are

706
00:53:47.44 --> 00:53:55.44
to develop and maintain a competitive advantage against them. G. We must understand our potential

707
00:53:55.44 --> 00:54:00.80
rivals, Sunsu, Art of War, know who you're fighting. The United States has many competitive

708
00:54:00.80 --> 00:54:05.36
advantage. Oh, by the way, obviously this is something that we're doing all the time at

709
00:54:05.36 --> 00:54:11.76
origin. Right? Well, there's we're competing against nations that make the same

710
00:54:12.32 --> 00:54:18.000
basic product that we make, but they're doing it with slave labor or they're doing it with

711
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.52
someone that's getting paid in horrible working conditions. And so we've had to find ways and we

712
00:54:23.52 --> 00:54:28.88
continue to find ways that we can compete with them. And not only are we competitive, we're better

713
00:54:28.88 --> 00:54:35.44
because our product ends up better. And because we're here now now you get into shipping and what

714
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:43.68
is it costs to ship things from overseas? What does that do to the whole picture? So we're

715
00:54:43.68 --> 00:54:49.20
we're figuring out and we have figured out how we have a competitive advantage, even though we

716
00:54:49.20 --> 00:54:53.92
take care of our workers, which we actually also feel is a competitive advantage. Taking care

717
00:54:53.92 --> 00:54:59.20
of your people is a competitive advantage. Because now your people care about the product that they're

718
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:09.68
making. They want to do a good job. Not not slaving in a in a sweatshop. Instead of looking

719
00:55:09.68 --> 00:55:17.44
instead of looking at slave labor as an advantage, I look at as a disadvantage. We've got the

720
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:25.12
advantage because we have a better workforce who care about the company. The United States has many

721
00:55:25.12 --> 00:55:30.72
competitive advantages in international competition. The world's largest economy and an international

722
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:35.84
financial system that uses the dollar to make transactions are strong economic advantages. Yes,

723
00:55:35.84 --> 00:55:40.96
the enduring US interests in freedom of navigation on the seas attracts many partners because

724
00:55:40.96 --> 00:55:45.68
free navigation reduces the overall cost of trading between nations. The US higher education system

725
00:55:45.68 --> 00:55:50.08
attracts students from all over the world. The list goes on and on. But these illustrations show

726
00:55:50.08 --> 00:55:54.64
that we should look for a nation's competitive advantages among its enduring qualities, such as

727
00:55:54.64 --> 00:56:00.08
values, interest and culture. And this is what you need to do. So how does this tie into everybody?

728
00:56:00.08 --> 00:56:09.68
What about your business? How do you have the culture and do you have the values inside your

729
00:56:09.68 --> 00:56:16.64
business that are actually competitive advantages? Do you have that? If you don't have that,

730
00:56:16.64 --> 00:56:21.52
if you don't have values, if you don't have a culture, that's a competitive advantage. You're wrong.

731
00:56:25.44 --> 00:56:33.44
The competitive advantages in the military component of dime are naturally of great interests

732
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:40.72
to Marines. Since World War II, the United States made the use of several military advantages

733
00:56:40.72 --> 00:56:46.72
such as the joint forces of ability to project and sustain power globally. It's skillet operating

734
00:56:46.72 --> 00:56:52.32
across domains and its expertise in precision targeting and strike. The US military's

735
00:56:52.32 --> 00:56:58.000
principal professionalism can also present distinctive advantages. For example, when it's

736
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.32
properly contrasted with competitors seeking to extend a fairitarian government without regard

737
00:57:02.32 --> 00:57:07.84
for rule of law or protection of civilians. So that's a huge advantage that we have is that we have

738
00:57:07.84 --> 00:57:12.24
military professionals. And that's what they do. And it's also advantage as far as on concern that

739
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:18.48
we have reserveists that come and serve in Iraq, come and serve in an Afghanist and that go

740
00:57:18.48 --> 00:57:23.44
for the weekend and see how the military is doing and take their civilian expertise into the

741
00:57:24.08 --> 00:57:29.36
into the reserve unit or the national guard unit for the weekend. We have both those.

742
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:32.64
And there's advantages to both of those.

743
00:57:35.12 --> 00:57:39.60
Talking about that, I think it was the Guadalcanal reason podcast.

744
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:44.48
We're talking about how some of the reserveists, where the people that said, hey, that's a

745
00:57:44.48 --> 00:57:50.56
dumb idea. We don't want to do that. Because they hadn't been indoctrinated as fully as

746
00:57:51.20 --> 00:57:56.56
somebody that had been an infantry officer for 18 years and he's looking at the problem going,

747
00:57:56.56 --> 00:58:00.72
hey, I know how to solve this problem in the book. I know what to do. And some reserveists are like,

748
00:58:00.72 --> 00:58:08.32
hey, bro, I hunt and ten a sea. And that doesn't make any sense. So we use this as a competitive advantage.

749
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:16.000
I'm just thinking this whole time about the connection between these military examples.

750
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.12
And I'm going through my head things that I remember as a Marine. And how closely

751
00:58:19.12 --> 00:58:26.48
connected they are to just everybody's life in both business and in life just the connections to

752
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:32.64
your family has you have long-range plans for your family. You have these strategic, long-range plans

753
00:58:32.64 --> 00:58:37.44
for your family. It's a really no different than I think they called the the enduring values of the

754
00:58:37.44 --> 00:58:45.04
country that you need to keep in mind that might actually change or influence the smaller things that you do.

755
00:58:45.04 --> 00:58:51.84
Yeah, and that's something I've been hitting on a lot. The fact that culture is the ultimate form

756
00:58:51.84 --> 00:58:56.24
of decentralized command. Culture is the ultimate form of decentralized command. Where now we have a

757
00:58:57.36 --> 00:59:01.44
a cashier that knows how to treat a client, a knows how to treat a customer because understands

758
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:06.56
the culture of the company. Now we have a Marine that can be out in town can see a situation unfolding

759
00:59:06.56 --> 00:59:11.44
and knows what decision to make it just based on the culture of the Marine Corps, of the seal teams,

760
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:17.52
of the army, of the 80 second airborne of the 101st airborne of the base. If you have that culture

761
00:59:17.52 --> 00:59:24.80
correct, that soldier, that Marine, that cashier, that frontline salesperson, they know what

762
00:59:24.80 --> 00:59:28.16
decision to make just based on the culture that you have inside the organization totally.

763
00:59:28.16 --> 00:59:33.92
And that's a two-way street too because if I'm running a grocery store and I've got a cashier,

764
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:37.60
I'm not going to spend all day every day just talking to that cashier about long-range strategic

765
00:59:37.60 --> 00:59:41.20
things for the company. I actually need that person up there, ringing up customers,

766
00:59:41.20 --> 00:59:47.52
as they're coming through. But if I, if I, as the CEO of that grocery chain or the CEO of that

767
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:54.32
company, don't think that that cashier can't make a strategic, a tattoo just in this massive

768
00:59:54.32 --> 00:59:58.64
strategic implications. And I lose side of the fact that they actually do, at certain intervals,

769
00:59:58.64 --> 01:00:03.28
need to understand how what they do affects the big picture. Then I'm actually sent myself up

770
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:07.52
for failure. Any Marine has ever been to Okuenawa, knows that when the Marine goes out and town

771
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:12.48
steals a car and runs into a fire hydrant, that Marine doesn't just get in trouble for sealant

772
01:00:12.48 --> 01:00:17.92
a car. That is an inter-national incident that undermines the relationship between two countries.

773
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:21.92
And it happens all the time. And if you don't think you're young folks that are doing this

774
01:00:21.92 --> 01:00:26.32
very tactical things, don't have to have some connection to the big picture enough to guide

775
01:00:27.04 --> 01:00:32.08
their day-to-day decisions. You are setting yourself up for long-term failure. And that works

776
01:00:32.08 --> 01:00:37.20
both ways. That cashier has to know, hey, I've got to treat this customer with some respect

777
01:00:37.20 --> 01:00:40.40
because if I don't, it's going to go on yellow, it's going to go on YouTube, it's going to go

778
01:00:40.40 --> 01:00:44.64
on Instagram or whatever that might be. And I could take down the whole company if I'm not careful.

779
01:00:45.28 --> 01:00:50.64
You know, I want to create paranoia, but they have to understand those small appearing to be small

780
01:00:50.64 --> 01:00:55.28
tattoo things can actually influence the entire organization. And they have to be able to make that

781
01:00:55.28 --> 01:01:04.64
connection. If you are in a situation like that and you're employing front line troops to carry out

782
01:01:04.64 --> 01:01:11.44
these sort of tactical day-to-day things, it's pretty easy to end up in the job market.

783
01:01:11.44 --> 01:01:16.40
The people that you're hiring, the human capital that you have available to you, it's pretty

784
01:01:16.40 --> 01:01:23.36
easy for them to be, hey, I actually, Dave C. E. O. Dave Burke, I actually don't really care about the

785
01:01:23.36 --> 01:01:28.96
company that much. And if you fire me tomorrow, I'll go get another minimum job, minimum wage

786
01:01:28.96 --> 01:01:32.000
jobs somewhere else and I don't really care. And so you sit here and tell me about how we can

787
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.08
have a strategic loss at your company because I don't treat a client right, whatever, right?

788
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:45.60
So what do you do then? And what do you have to do is you have to then explain two people

789
01:01:46.32 --> 01:01:54.56
that when that they have strategic goals in their life, that they need to have some kind of a

790
01:01:54.56 --> 01:02:00.32
path that they're going on. That hey, listen, listen echo Charles, I know you don't really care

791
01:02:00.32 --> 01:02:06.88
about work in here, that's fine. I get it. Listen, add a minimum. If you do a good job here,

792
01:02:06.88 --> 01:02:10.16
if you work here for six months, you work here for ten, 12 months, I don't know how long you're

793
01:02:10.16 --> 01:02:15.28
in work for here for. When you leave, I can give you a recommendation that'll get you a better job

794
01:02:15.28 --> 01:02:20.80
somewhere. That'll put you on a better path. And that's all I want. Look, I know you don't necessarily

795
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:25.76
care about my company here. You don't like flipping burgers, I get it. But guess what?

796
01:02:25.76 --> 01:02:30.72
When you get done flipping burgers here, you can go get a job doing something that's a little

797
01:02:30.72 --> 01:02:36.88
bit better. So I don't, this isn't just about me and the company here, jockels burgers. Look,

798
01:02:36.88 --> 01:02:41.28
I'm going to be selling burgers for a long time. That's what I do. I love burgers. I know that

799
01:02:41.28 --> 01:02:46.56
this isn't your life goal. Guess what? What is your life goal? Where is it? Where are you at?

800
01:02:46.56 --> 01:02:50.48
Because I can promise you this. If you take care of me here, at some point, you're going to leave.

801
01:02:50.48 --> 01:02:55.20
I expect that. You got a lot of potential. When you leave here, I want to leave. I want you to leave

802
01:02:55.20 --> 01:03:00.24
on the best foot possible, set up for a long-term, better situation. I don't want you flipping

803
01:03:00.24 --> 01:03:05.92
burgers forever. But if you flip burgers well, that's the path to not flipping burgers, which is

804
01:03:05.92 --> 01:03:11.84
really interesting. One time I said, there was a person that talked about, uh, do I really need

805
01:03:11.84 --> 01:03:17.28
to learn GJ2 if I don't like to fight? And I said, that you actually should learn GJ2 more than

806
01:03:17.28 --> 01:03:23.52
anybody else if you don't like to fight. Echo, if you don't like flipping burgers, you more than

807
01:03:23.52 --> 01:03:27.28
anyone else should say, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to be the best burger

808
01:03:27.28 --> 01:03:34.96
flipper that I can be because that's going to allow me to step up into the next room because if you

809
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:40.000
can't flip burgers, bro, how can I expect you to do anything else? You're definitely not stepping

810
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.80
up to salad bar. And if you can't handle salad bar, you know, you're not going to be

811
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:49.68
day opener. Right? And if you can't be the day opener, you're not going to be the general manager.

812
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:51.84
If you're not the, well, if you're not going to be the storm manager, then the general manager,

813
01:03:51.84 --> 01:03:56.24
you see where this goes? And by the way, if you don't want to get in the restaurant business,

814
01:03:56.24 --> 01:04:02.56
that's fine too. When you go to work at a, at a mechanics shop, you want to be

815
01:04:02.56 --> 01:04:07.20
want to be an automotive mechanic. And that's where you want to go. What do I tell them when

816
01:04:07.20 --> 01:04:13.36
they call here to say, could Echo Charles flip burgers effectively and efficiently and reliably?

817
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:20.48
And I have to say, no, he couldn't, he was late on a regular basis. Or whatever, what if I say,

818
01:04:20.48 --> 01:04:27.04
hey, you know what, Echo's, hey, he was totally reliable, good to go, great attitude. Yeah, if you,

819
01:04:27.04 --> 01:04:33.12
if you look in a higher somebody that's going to be able to be a real bonus inside your organization,

820
01:04:33.68 --> 01:04:40.08
Echo Charles the guy, that's what I want to do for you. But you got at least, you got to do

821
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:44.48
something for me too. So if you're running it, if you're working with that, those those kind of

822
01:04:44.48 --> 01:04:51.12
entry level positions, sure, show them the strategic for the company for the business, but also show

823
01:04:51.12 --> 01:04:57.20
them strategically because, look, kids don't get that these days. I, but never mind, these days,

824
01:04:57.20 --> 01:05:02.16
I did, you know what, you know why I ended up doing okay in life is because I joined the navy.

825
01:05:02.16 --> 01:05:08.88
And they were like, do this and I said, Roger, wanted to be a good seal. Just that, that enough,

826
01:05:08.88 --> 01:05:14.96
that guidance, that, that goal was enough for me to like keep me out of trouble, keep me from being

827
01:05:14.96 --> 01:05:19.60
at total idiot. I was a partial idiot plenty of times. Kept me out of being a total idiot.

828
01:05:20.88 --> 01:05:27.04
So when you have the opportunity to show somebody, show a younger person, hey, what you're doing

829
01:05:27.04 --> 01:05:31.04
right now is connected to the future. You might want to think about it. Here's what is your future.

830
01:05:31.04 --> 01:05:39.76
Oh, okay. Well, you want to be whatever you want to be. First step is flip and burgers. And that's

831
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:44.16
okay. Flip them good. Don't burn them. Keep them, keep them together.

832
01:05:48.96 --> 01:05:54.64
Note that these competitive advantages exist across the competition continuum and not only in the

833
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:59.52
time of war, we conduct exercises in part to demonstrate that United States has a military capability.

834
01:05:59.52 --> 01:06:06.56
It could use if necessary. The existence of these capabilities can impose costs on a potential

835
01:06:06.56 --> 01:06:13.84
rival because the rival may need to expand resources if they want to overcome or negate a US

836
01:06:13.84 --> 01:06:19.20
competitive advantage as the rival pursuits are close. So you're, you're making other people pay

837
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:27.20
another little, little plug for the Marine Corps. Hey, you got to have us. You got to have us,

838
01:06:27.20 --> 01:06:30.48
you got to have us well-training. You got to have us well prepared for battle because that makes

839
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:35.68
everyone else even poses a cost on everybody else, which is a positive thing. Record needs more exercises.

840
01:06:35.68 --> 01:06:42.32
Yes. When viewed from this perspective, we gain an insight of into how a military competitive

841
01:06:42.32 --> 01:06:48.96
advantage can help us compete with a rival. Also note that it needs to be a conscious decision on

842
01:06:48.96 --> 01:06:55.76
when and how to reveal our most sensitive competitive advantages. At a minimum, we should leverage

843
01:06:55.76 --> 01:07:01.92
such revelations for advantage in the information element of power. Other capabilities might be

844
01:07:01.92 --> 01:07:07.76
cloaked in secrecy and so they actually need to be used. So they're awesome. Don't just reveal

845
01:07:09.44 --> 01:07:15.52
the special move that you have to kick someone's ass. Yeah, man. We're celebrating, I think,

846
01:07:15.52 --> 01:07:20.80
at least I am. This is the anniversary of the kickoff of Desert Storm. I think it was,

847
01:07:20.80 --> 01:07:25.84
well, when recorded, it's a couple of January 17th, 1991. That was the kickoff of Desert Storm.

848
01:07:25.84 --> 01:07:32.32
And I was kind of a kid wanting to be a pilot and the big reveal for us on that one that

849
01:07:32.32 --> 01:07:37.60
people don't understand is the stealth fighter. And all of a sudden, there's this big triple A in

850
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:43.60
anti-aircraft system and it's going to be the Roomba Moserobus air defense system ever. And night zero,

851
01:07:43.60 --> 01:07:47.60
you know, in Iraq and all of a sudden things just are blowing up and Baghdad and nobody has any

852
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:51.76
idea why they're just sitting there watching things blow up. There's nothing on radar. There's

853
01:07:51.76 --> 01:07:55.52
nothing out there as far as they know except they can hear airplanes flying overhead because the

854
01:07:55.52 --> 01:07:59.52
jet engines are making sound and then things are just blowing up. And we're basically told the

855
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:05.92
world, oh, by the way, we hated to have to do this. But if you're wondering, this is what we can do.

856
01:08:05.92 --> 01:08:12.56
You might want to, and that's 30 years ago, our competitors are just just now, think the amount of

857
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:16.80
time and money invested in them trying to build stealth technology, which has been a huge race

858
01:08:16.80 --> 01:08:22.64
in a big competition. We showed that to the world on day zero of the war. And as a pilot, obviously,

859
01:08:22.64 --> 01:08:25.68
we think about that too, as the competitive advantage makes other people go, well,

860
01:08:27.20 --> 01:08:30.80
maybe it's just not worth going to war with them. Maybe this just isn't worth it. Maybe this

861
01:08:30.80 --> 01:08:33.68
investment we're making is not worth it because they outcome, they can do things we need to

862
01:08:33.68 --> 01:08:40.24
know exist. So the revelation of that when carefully placed in time, well, can, can be a huge

863
01:08:40.24 --> 01:08:44.32
advantage. Yeah, not to mention they had no time to adapt to it because if we were to told them,

864
01:08:44.32 --> 01:08:47.84
they would have figured out some methodology or I'll tell you some attempt to figure out a more

865
01:08:47.84 --> 01:08:53.44
accurate radar or some kind of a defense system that could spot these aircraft overhead. Yeah,

866
01:08:53.44 --> 01:09:00.80
that's a great example of how you do it. It happens in GJ2, like if you have that move that you're

867
01:09:00.80 --> 01:09:06.56
pretty good at and you go for it, it's not a surprise anymore. I'm not saying you're not going to

868
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:12.08
get it, but it's not a surprise. And now the person's expecting it to come. So you want if you're going

869
01:09:12.08 --> 01:09:16.72
to do it, might want to hang on to it just for, you know, a little bit deeper into that role,

870
01:09:16.72 --> 01:09:27.92
let that person be breathin' hard, let the O2 start to lack. All types of competitive advantages

871
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:33.60
can atrophy, however, they all need appropriate practice exercising and improving if they are to remain

872
01:09:33.60 --> 01:09:39.28
advantages in the dynamic environment of international competition. Just so you can't, you can't rest

873
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:47.36
on your laurels, ever. You can't rest on your laurels, ever. Competitors as systems, competitors are

874
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:55.84
complex, adaptive systems. Again, this, this, this, competitors are complex, adaptive systems. I guess

875
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:01.44
we kind of need to say it, right? We need to make it clear. And then, but it does make it even more

876
01:10:01.44 --> 01:10:05.52
clear, meaning they have many parts and these parts interact with each other in non-linear,

877
01:10:05.52 --> 01:10:10.80
often unpredictable ways. Consider Iran's national security decision-making structure. To some

878
01:10:10.80 --> 01:10:17.04
outside observers, they may appear to function as a strictly hierarchical organization with all

879
01:10:17.04 --> 01:10:20.96
important decisions being made by the Supreme Leader and President at the top of the pyramid,

880
01:10:20.96 --> 01:10:25.44
however, the rest story is much more complex. Much of the Supreme Leader's authority comes from

881
01:10:25.44 --> 01:10:30.80
informal relationships. He has with top commanders in the national security infrastructure

882
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:35.92
and through the presence of his clerical representatives in military organizations. Even though

883
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:40.08
the president is the chairman of the Supreme Council for national security, his power,

884
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:45.12
EBS and flows because the Supreme Leader is the commander in chief and may bypass the president

885
01:10:45.12 --> 01:10:56.56
through his informal relationships. So, even in that, like they said, very strict, what one appears to

886
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:03.12
be a strict hierarchy? It's all over the place. Guess what's more important? Relationships. Relationships

887
01:11:03.12 --> 01:11:08.88
are more important than the chain of command, even in an auto-cratic country like Iran.

888
01:11:12.08 --> 01:11:16.40
The military structure itself can act in under-predictable ways, especially the Islamic Revolutionary

889
01:11:16.40 --> 01:11:21.84
Guards. They've developed significant and separate political power based on its financial

890
01:11:21.84 --> 01:11:27.04
resources because it controls many businesses in almost every sector of the Iranian economy.

891
01:11:27.04 --> 01:11:30.64
Each of these power centers, among others, Jockey's for power inside Iran,

892
01:11:30.64 --> 01:11:37.52
working to advance their own internal or domestic interests. So, it's complicated.

893
01:11:39.12 --> 01:11:44.08
It's complicated. And you know what's crazy when you see videos, you ever seen videos in

894
01:11:44.08 --> 01:11:53.20
our pictures in Iran in like 19, whatever, 1973. It's totally westernized. It looks just like everything's

895
01:11:53.20 --> 01:12:02.80
good to go. Skip and forward a little bit, developing a model of how a competitor system fits

896
01:12:02.80 --> 01:12:07.60
together helps identify their competitive strengths, weaknesses, at a basic level, each of these

897
01:12:07.60 --> 01:12:15.04
systems consists of people, ideas, and things. The people make the system work. They also

898
01:12:15.04 --> 01:12:20.72
analyze its performance over time because they are also responsible for sustaining or improving

899
01:12:20.72 --> 01:12:27.60
the systems competitive advantages. The ideas of the system are found in the goals it pursues

900
01:12:27.60 --> 01:12:36.08
and in concepts it processes it uses to operate in the world. Mow famously stated politics

901
01:12:36.08 --> 01:12:41.12
is a war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed. This quote suggests a mindset

902
01:12:41.12 --> 01:12:48.48
that blurs the lines between peace and war. The mindset, this idea creates may give a competitor

903
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:55.20
and advantage in operating near the threshold of violence. So, that statement from Mow is sort of

904
01:12:55.20 --> 01:12:59.52
the same thing that this whole, there's a continuum, right? You got politics, which is just war

905
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:03.36
without blood. And then at some point you turn it into war. Now we got politics with bloodshed.

906
01:13:03.36 --> 01:13:09.20
But I'm going to dig into this one a little bit. Ideally, there are things then added or

907
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:13.36
created to support the people and the ideas within the system. So we're talking about people,

908
01:13:13.36 --> 01:13:22.24
ideas, and things. With this in mind, within the system helping it achieve its goals.

909
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:27.28
With this in mind, we can look at a competitor system and create a model of how it fits together,

910
01:13:27.28 --> 01:13:34.16
where it is strong, and where it is vulnerable. Finally, after creating this model, Marines must remain

911
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:40.72
disciplined in its use. Models are useful, but in perfect, they are theories about the systemic

912
01:13:40.72 --> 01:13:45.20
structure of our rival. We need to remain alert for opportunities to improve our models

913
01:13:46.08 --> 01:13:52.72
as we learn more about how our competitors operate in the real world. Now this is the thing that

914
01:13:52.72 --> 01:14:00.88
so they talk about the simple people, ideas, and things. That's sort of what a competitor system is.

915
01:14:01.52 --> 01:14:07.20
And I added, well, this is up for debate, but I'll throw it out there for you. People,

916
01:14:07.20 --> 01:14:13.44
ideas, and things. That's sort of what you judge how your competitors are going to operate.

917
01:14:14.72 --> 01:14:18.96
I think perhaps there is possibly one more that needs to be added.

918
01:14:18.96 --> 01:14:26.72
And it may be covered by people, and it may be covered by ideas, and it not things, but a little bit.

919
01:14:26.72 --> 01:14:35.12
That is the idea of execution or taking action. So you can have people, you can have ideas,

920
01:14:35.12 --> 01:14:44.48
and you can have things. But if you can't execute, then you're dead in the water. Now,

921
01:14:44.48 --> 01:14:50.48
you could say that it's people that need to make things execute. So, okay, I get that. But I just

922
01:14:50.48 --> 01:14:59.04
felt the need to kind of call that out because when I look at a competitor, I think about,

923
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:03.84
yes, they got these people. Yes, they got their, they got this team. They've got these ideas. Okay,

924
01:15:03.84 --> 01:15:09.28
I get, they've got some competitive advantages there, or disadvantages. And they've got things. They got

925
01:15:09.28 --> 01:15:16.72
them, they've got things. But all three of those things without execution, to me, I'm not even worried

926
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:23.12
about you. I'm not even worried about you. If you can't execute. So, I don't know. Am I, am I

927
01:15:23.76 --> 01:15:29.36
reaching to you? Am I not giving enough credit to people? Possibly? Yeah, I mean, I guess that you

928
01:15:29.36 --> 01:15:34.56
could dig into deeper on what they mean by that. But when you said it, the first thing that went into

929
01:15:34.56 --> 01:15:40.64
my mind works in the opposite direction, too, is that they might not have the best, well, most well-trained

930
01:15:40.64 --> 01:15:45.28
people. And maybe their tools are kind of outdated and their systems aren't so great because they're

931
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:49.92
antiquated and maybe they don't have big budgets. But if these people have been executing and what

932
01:15:49.92 --> 01:15:53.68
with brought me to is how many times you've said on this podcast is who we were fighting in Iraq,

933
01:15:54.56 --> 01:15:59.92
who we were fighting against al-Qaeda. They're things, they're things were garbage. On paper,

934
01:15:59.92 --> 01:16:06.08
compared to ours, garbage. They were rusty. They were old. And there are people, and I don't mean

935
01:16:06.08 --> 01:16:09.44
it like there are people like something wrong with their people, but they didn't have the training

936
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:12.80
we had. They didn't have the resources. They had their people weren't invested in in the way that we

937
01:16:12.80 --> 01:16:18.40
invested in our people. But you know what they had been doing? They'd been executing for a really

938
01:16:18.40 --> 01:16:23.60
long time. So that piece, and maybe somebody could say, well, that's what people is and

939
01:16:23.60 --> 01:16:29.44
might be missing that. But I'm thinking of people like, I know what American marines and soldiers,

940
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:33.84
I know what those people are. And it's really easy to look across and go, those people, those people,

941
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:40.64
and just dismiss what they are. But those people had been executing and they were really good as a result.

942
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:45.92
And offset where we thought we had this big advantage. Look at our gear. Look at our training. On paper,

943
01:16:46.80 --> 01:16:51.20
it should have been a one side of the fair. If you measured it with those things and what they weren't

944
01:16:51.20 --> 01:16:56.88
measuring was the value of the, I think what you're saying is the execution. Yeah, and even

945
01:16:56.88 --> 01:17:01.20
what you just said, like, if you take a group of marines or you take a group of soldiers,

946
01:17:03.60 --> 01:17:08.64
and they have training and it's all good. But if they don't execute and you could say, well,

947
01:17:08.64 --> 01:17:14.32
a marine is going to execute. We know that's actually not true. It's a good ideal. We could say

948
01:17:14.32 --> 01:17:18.48
a soldier is going to soldier with a, with a, with a platoon leader is going to execute.

949
01:17:19.28 --> 01:17:25.12
Not necessarily true. Not only, yeah. So to me, it's almost like a four thing that does make

950
01:17:25.12 --> 01:17:30.48
sense in there. Yeah. I actually thought that the third one was going to be the execution.

951
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:38.000
People things and people people ideas ideas and execution. Yeah. That what, so it's almost like

952
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.16
and listening to you guys and you said a good thing. You said, um, Dave, sit on paper.

953
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:46.32
Because like that's kind of really what that whole thing kind of seems like it is because,

954
01:17:46.32 --> 01:17:54.32
okay, so you got people ideas and things. But people and ideas is, it's almost like people is what

955
01:17:54.32 --> 01:18:01.84
you can do and then execution is what you will do. So the, so again, on paper, where you have this

956
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:07.60
capability, you have this many people with this capability with these tools and what they can do with

957
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:12.56
these tools and then, but then just like I said, it doesn't mean that they're going to do. Yeah.

958
01:18:12.56 --> 01:18:18.16
Yeah. You know, like just, you guys say default aggressive. It's like that's that, that third kind of

959
01:18:18.16 --> 01:18:24.72
thing that you have to implement to create this execution. You ever seen an MMA fight that was about

960
01:18:24.72 --> 01:18:32.40
to happen and on paper, the got fighter A should destroy fighter B and what, what is the problem

961
01:18:32.40 --> 01:18:37.84
when he loses? Yeah. The problem is he doesn't execute. Yeah. The, the good and not to go too deep into

962
01:18:37.84 --> 01:18:41.44
the MMA thing. So remember certain, uh, cowboy, surrounding the animal, the animal, the animal,

963
01:18:41.44 --> 01:18:48.16
connamo-grigger, right? So you, like, Soroni is an executor guy. He executes, he executes, but then Connor is

964
01:18:48.16 --> 01:18:53.92
like a cerebral guy, like he'll play up stuff before the fight as well to kind of create that, that third

965
01:18:53.92 --> 01:18:59.84
man in the ring. And that third man in the ring, in this case, was to get in the way of execution.

966
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:05.76
And there's like a video on it to that theorize this where connamo-grigger was usually he's talking

967
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:11.44
trash to the guy telling them basically how much like junker of a fighter than he then he is or whatever,

968
01:19:11.44 --> 01:19:15.92
but it was the opposite this time. It was like he was saying, oh man, I respect him and it was friendly.

969
01:19:15.92 --> 01:19:23.68
He was really friendly actually. So it theoretically created this mindset on Donald Soroni's in his mind.

970
01:19:23.68 --> 01:19:29.12
Yeah. That's like all of that. And it kind of took away from his execution instinct, you know.

971
01:19:29.12 --> 01:19:34.64
So he was like, oh, it's like, oh, it's not as we're kind of frozen away. You know, it's like super

972
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:40.32
respectful fight. And then you see Connor how he came out in the fight all crazy. And it's almost like

973
01:19:40.32 --> 01:19:46.16
he almost, you know, weird way surprised him, which how hard he was executing on a guy who usually

974
01:19:46.16 --> 01:19:52.08
executes, but that element didn't seem to be there as much, you know. So it's like man, that execution

975
01:19:52.08 --> 01:20:01.20
part of it, but that's a huge deal. Yeah. And just props to Calboy, props to Connor. Calboy,

976
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:08.88
dude, he, he's got some scorer. And he does eight million other things.

977
01:20:13.12 --> 01:20:19.60
I wrote something down as you were getting to those, you know, connecting those two paragraphs.

978
01:20:19.60 --> 01:20:24.48
And it's, it's really interesting to hear the conversations that you just had and that adding

979
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:29.84
that additional piece, I wrote down in my margin here, you don't know. And so this model,

980
01:20:29.84 --> 01:20:34.32
this thing, this we create and and the military does this all that we make create models for

981
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:37.68
everything. And we're like, hey, I'm going to run a thousand simulations against my machine and

982
01:20:37.68 --> 01:20:43.28
that we do models for everything. We create this. And it was saying, hey, don't rely on that model.

983
01:20:43.28 --> 01:20:49.12
That's even more evidence. The, the, you don't know, we can create a model that can be useful

984
01:20:49.12 --> 01:20:52.16
for what, competitions can be like what we think the economies are going to look like. And we

985
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:56.56
can look at history. We can create a whole bunch of things that help us make decisions. But at the end of

986
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:04.24
all that you don't know, you don't know. And so if you don't know how useful is it getting back

987
01:21:04.24 --> 01:21:08.96
to the first thing is how useful is it to dig in on your way of doing? If you really don't know,

988
01:21:08.96 --> 01:21:13.28
and that's really what this is saying. Even, I could say, Jockel, I've run the numbers. I've done

989
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:17.60
this analysis. I've compared to these last three, a row, I should say, if I could give you a thousand

990
01:21:17.60 --> 01:21:23.12
reasons why this is the answer. And at the end, I should say, but I still don't know, because you

991
01:21:23.12 --> 01:21:27.84
don't know. And that's really part of what this is saying to. And the piece in there, when you

992
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:34.16
talk about the implementation, that's where the execution, where it's all going to happen. So not knowing

993
01:21:34.16 --> 01:21:38.96
and acknowledging you don't know is also a really powerful thing. And you're building this

994
01:21:38.96 --> 01:21:43.68
framework in your mind of how things are going to be. Yeah. It also, that introduces the idea of

995
01:21:45.04 --> 01:21:52.24
I know what you think is going to happen. And I'm not going to allow that to occur, which is,

996
01:21:52.24 --> 01:21:57.36
you know, what game you think, if I can convince you that all right, Dave, you and I are going

997
01:21:57.36 --> 01:22:04.56
to stand up. And you see this is like the the the most lame example, but you know, some of

998
01:22:04.56 --> 01:22:09.36
it's like, oh, you know, some wrestler that's like, no way, I'm going to, I'm going to knock him out. I'm

999
01:22:09.36 --> 01:22:12.56
going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. I'm going to knock him out. And he's trying to convince

1000
01:22:12.56 --> 01:22:15.76
the other person that like we're going to stand in fights. You don't have to worry about your ground

1001
01:22:15.76 --> 01:22:20.56
game or whatever. And then he goes out and takes him down and does what he's going to do. It's

1002
01:22:20.56 --> 01:22:27.52
this, what game are you going to play? Like, I'm going to get you out of your game. That's what I'm

1003
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:33.04
going to do. Take away your competitive. Yeah, actually, Jeremy Stevens against Petus Anthony Petus.

1004
01:22:33.92 --> 01:22:41.04
And you know, Anthony Petus is a striker primarily. And I was cornering Jeremy on that fight.

1005
01:22:41.04 --> 01:22:50.24
And Jeremy's got, you know, fists of lead. And he knocks people out. And he he might not be the

1006
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:54.40
most technical striker. I'm not saying he's not technically not. I would say he's not as technical

1007
01:22:54.40 --> 01:23:01.04
as Anthony Petus was at that time. And so we're going into the fight. Jeremy definitely going

1008
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:06.000
into the fight thinking, hey, it's been no cool. I'm going to stand up. I know I can take a punch.

1009
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.12
And I'm going to connect at some point with Petus's chin. And I'm going to win. What did Petus do?

1010
01:23:11.12 --> 01:23:17.12
Came out, took him down. And it was a surprise. It's surprised to me. It's a surprise to Jeremy.

1011
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:22.88
And that's the way it went. But he changed. He did what we didn't expect him to do, which is just

1012
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:26.80
a brilliant move, right? So all the things that you think you know,

1013
01:23:28.16 --> 01:23:33.60
done happen had another fighter was like, hey, aren't you going to work ground game? And he's like,

1014
01:23:33.60 --> 01:23:37.76
I can't, I'm not going to get taken down by this guy. And I said, man, you better at least,

1015
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:42.96
you know, work to get off your back. I'm not going to get taken down. He's not good enough

1016
01:23:42.96 --> 01:23:48.000
of a wrestler to take me down. He's a striker. Okay. Cool. What happened? This, this is after the

1017
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.44
lessons learned, right? The lessons learned from Jeremy is, you better be ready for whatever,

1018
01:23:51.44 --> 01:23:57.12
you better train to fight. Because you can't predict what the, what you're saying Dave,

1019
01:23:57.12 --> 01:24:01.04
I can't predict what the enemy is going to do. Can't predict it. I don't know what the enemy's

1020
01:24:01.04 --> 01:24:05.52
going to do. I might think one thing, but I can't, that doesn't mean I can blow off every other

1021
01:24:05.52 --> 01:24:11.52
possibility at all. What I need to do is be prepared too fight. You know, the closest thing that they

1022
01:24:11.52 --> 01:24:18.96
say in this is a performance, they kind of, I'm trying, I like Doug Fetus, like, where are my missing,

1023
01:24:18.96 --> 01:24:21.76
it maybe they are talking about execution numbers, don't see it? Like the closest I think they

1024
01:24:21.76 --> 01:24:28.16
have is they say analyze, you know, the, the opponents performance over time. So your sort of talking

1025
01:24:28.16 --> 01:24:34.72
about execution maybe he doesn't really do it, but I think maybe an additional item to assess

1026
01:24:34.72 --> 01:24:44.48
your opponent is necessary. And that is people, ideas, things, and execution. We also look at

1027
01:24:44.48 --> 01:24:49.52
our own system to increase our competitive advantages or create new ones. For example,

1028
01:24:50.96 --> 01:24:55.04
do the people in our system have their necessary skills and aptitudes required to sustain

1029
01:24:55.04 --> 01:25:00.32
our competitive advantages. Do they have the skills to build new ones? At a national level,

1030
01:25:00.32 --> 01:25:05.68
does the target population for our recruiting efforts have the right education in a similar way?

1031
01:25:05.68 --> 01:25:11.28
Can we look at our ideas? Do our operating concepts give us an advantage? And things do,

1032
01:25:11.28 --> 01:25:16.40
does any of our equipment provide over match to evaluate our competitive system system? Again,

1033
01:25:17.20 --> 01:25:21.04
to me, we can check the, we can check the ideas, we can check the things, we can check the people.

1034
01:25:21.04 --> 01:25:26.08
I better check the execution because none of this stuff matters without execution.

1035
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.04
It's not always true that the organization with a new,

1036
01:25:33.04 --> 01:25:38.80
istermost equipment wins the competition, quote Dave Burke. Sometimes aside, it is able to combine

1037
01:25:38.80 --> 01:25:43.92
adequate material with innovative new ideas becomes the winner from this analysis. We can then

1038
01:25:43.92 --> 01:25:47.20
increase our existing advantages or create new ones as deemed necessary.

1039
01:25:47.20 --> 01:25:55.04
Means in competition. As similarly described, we're fighting the highest level of competition

1040
01:25:55.04 --> 01:25:59.44
involves the use of all the elements of power. Marines are primarily concerned with the military

1041
01:25:59.44 --> 01:26:04.40
aspects of competition, but we must not consider it an isolation from the other elements of

1042
01:26:04.40 --> 01:26:10.88
national power. War fighting states, quote, the use of military force may take any number of

1043
01:26:10.88 --> 01:26:16.08
forms from the mere deployment of forces as a demonstration of resolve to the enforcement of a

1044
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:20.56
negotiated truth, truth to general warfare with sophisticated weaponry.

1045
01:26:22.56 --> 01:26:26.56
And, quote, here we see the alignment between our war fighting and competition doctrines start to

1046
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:32.48
immerse. So the whole point of this thing. In war, we impose our will on our adversary.

1047
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Their cooperation is not required. Going back into influence and leadership, right?

1048
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.44
In competition, we make use of military force to attract or coerce.

1049
01:26:47.52 --> 01:26:51.60
When using attraction, we use incentives, talking earlier about the carrot. We use incentives

1050
01:26:51.60 --> 01:26:57.52
to induce arrival or other political actor to adopt a position favorable to us or otherwise allow

1051
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:05.76
us to reach our goals. And you know what? Sometimes we're going to talk about leadership,

1052
01:27:05.76 --> 01:27:11.44
I talk about efficiency. And sometimes people think the most efficient thing for me to do is say,

1053
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:15.92
Dave, you need to use this route to get to the target. And people think that's the most of it.

1054
01:27:15.92 --> 01:27:21.12
Hey, and it's really hard to see past that. Because clearly, if I have to say,

1055
01:27:21.84 --> 01:27:24.40
you know, hey, Dave, well, how do you want to do it? And we have to have a discussion about it.

1056
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:28.32
It takes us another seven minutes before I finally comply with actually what you want to do.

1057
01:27:29.20 --> 01:27:31.04
And that seems a lot less efficient. Yeah.

1058
01:27:31.04 --> 01:27:38.96
But the efficiency comes out 10 fold in the field and in the execution. Let's think about the execution.

1059
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:46.08
It's because as a leader, you have to recognize that what you're doing is not getting

1060
01:27:46.80 --> 01:27:51.04
to point eight a point to be in this patrol. That's not what the actual goal is. That might be

1061
01:27:51.04 --> 01:27:53.44
this little mission. There's a little plack about what you're trying to do is create a leader.

1062
01:27:53.44 --> 01:27:57.12
That at some point can go fight a war for you independently without you being there in a way that

1063
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.28
reinforce it. So it's this recognition that's not that's not even what you're trying to do.

1064
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:08.72
And it's that it's that mirage of this is the best way to get it done. I get your face to tell you

1065
01:28:08.72 --> 01:28:15.04
what to do and look what happened. He did it mission accomplished. That is only true if the only thing

1066
01:28:15.04 --> 01:28:19.52
you're actually doing is getting from point eight to point B, which simply is not what you're doing.

1067
01:28:19.52 --> 01:28:24.000
That's not what you're doing. That's zero percent of the time. Zero. It's not what you're doing.

1068
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:31.36
When using coercion, we can pedal arrival to take an action in our favor or to stop taking

1069
01:28:31.36 --> 01:28:35.20
an action that's not in our favor or we make use of military force to deter arrival from taking

1070
01:28:35.20 --> 01:28:41.12
action in the first place. For both compelants and deterrence, our goal is to use the threat of

1071
01:28:41.12 --> 01:28:46.56
military force to achieve our desired outcome. For this to be the case, our competitive advantage

1072
01:28:46.56 --> 01:28:51.12
must be clear enough to our rival that it affects the decisions they make. What's interesting about

1073
01:28:51.12 --> 01:29:01.12
this is when I'm your boss Dave, I have to remember that when I'm talking to you, there is

1074
01:29:01.12 --> 01:29:07.12
the threat of me being able to fire you. I might not even say a word about it. So I have to kind of

1075
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:14.64
consciously mitigate that threat so that you will push back against me so that you will understand

1076
01:29:14.64 --> 01:29:20.56
that I'm open to your ideas. I have to consciously do that. So I'm not just compliant. Just yeah,

1077
01:29:20.56 --> 01:29:25.44
because that threat's there. And sometimes we work with companies where people are just scarred.

1078
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:29.52
No one will say anything back to the boss because the last boss with tyrannical idiot that

1079
01:29:29.52 --> 01:29:33.52
barked everyone and told them what to do and fired half the organization and everyone was

1080
01:29:33.52 --> 01:29:38.24
scared all the time to make a move. And that's why, by the way, that's why we show up there because

1081
01:29:38.24 --> 01:29:41.52
the business is failing because there's total centralized community doesn't work.

1082
01:29:46.16 --> 01:29:49.36
So you've got to use the threat of military force for this to be the case. Our competitive

1083
01:29:49.36 --> 01:29:54.24
advantage must be clear enough for a rival to that it affects their decisions. Note that a competitive

1084
01:29:54.24 --> 01:29:58.48
advantage does not necessarily equal military superiority, a competitive strength of will,

1085
01:29:59.28 --> 01:30:03.68
along with non-military tools of policy are part of the equation too.

1086
01:30:05.68 --> 01:30:10.32
Attraction, political actors often use various forms of attraction to achieve their goals,

1087
01:30:10.32 --> 01:30:15.20
to attract someone to attract someone as to induce entice or persuade someone into doing something.

1088
01:30:15.20 --> 01:30:21.28
And an negotiation is a reward or incentive for someone to make a choice that is favorable to us.

1089
01:30:21.28 --> 01:30:26.56
We can say that then that attraction is the counterpoint to coercion instead of using pressure

1090
01:30:26.56 --> 01:30:31.20
to help our goals, we use some type of reward instead. Okay, carrot, stick. That's what we're talking

1091
01:30:31.20 --> 01:30:37.28
about. Marines participate in attraction strategies all the time demonstrating our professional

1092
01:30:37.28 --> 01:30:42.48
commitment to our national values when conducting bilateral training. And recent years, for example,

1093
01:30:42.48 --> 01:30:48.80
as part of US larger US attraction strategy, Marine provided training on amphibious operations

1094
01:30:48.80 --> 01:30:53.36
to an important ally to Pan. Check. That's what that's what the Marines are doing all the time.

1095
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.20
That's what the entire military is doing all the time. That's what we need to

1096
01:31:00.24 --> 01:31:06.88
continue to do. We get into coercion fast forward a little bit. Political actors often use

1097
01:31:06.88 --> 01:31:12.48
coercion as a way to achieve their goals. To coerc someone as to pressure intimidate or force

1098
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:17.20
someone into doing something or to reach one goals through the use of pressure threat or force.

1099
01:31:19.44 --> 01:31:22.80
There's a big difference in jujitsu between attraction and coercion.

1100
01:31:22.80 --> 01:31:28.48
Right, attraction is like you get someone to defend their neck so that you can take their on.

1101
01:31:29.92 --> 01:31:35.44
You can also force them to put themselves in a certain position. I guess that one's a little

1102
01:31:35.44 --> 01:31:39.04
bit of a bad example because you kind of have to defend your neck. So you're coercing them to get

1103
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.52
those hands in position. It does this by influencing an adversary as a will or incentive structure.

1104
01:31:45.52 --> 01:31:50.64
It is a strategy that often combines the threat of force. And if necessary, the limited controlled

1105
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.28
use of force with positive inducements, coercion as two forms, compelence and deterrence,

1106
01:31:55.28 --> 01:32:00.64
compelence is a threat intended to make an adversary do something to take a specific action.

1107
01:32:00.64 --> 01:32:06.24
And deterrence is a threat intended to inhibit an adversary from taking a particular action

1108
01:32:06.24 --> 01:32:12.48
to prevent it from even getting started. In both cases, the target of coercion must be

1109
01:32:13.04 --> 01:32:18.56
cooperate, must cooperate because the target must decide to comply with the goal of an actor

1110
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:24.64
who is applying the coercion. This cooperation is not friendly or willing but still must

1111
01:32:24.64 --> 01:32:31.68
exist for coercion to be effective. Not friendly, not willing. So just to be clear, so the coercion

1112
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:38.000
positive and negative or the coercion, like, okay, I'm going to force this guy or intimidate

1113
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:47.28
this person to do something versus not versus, but then additionally the other coercion method

1114
01:32:47.28 --> 01:32:54.72
is to intimidate them to not do something. Yes, either compeling them to do something or

1115
01:32:54.72 --> 01:32:59.12
you're deterring them from doing something but you kind of have to participate in it.

1116
01:32:59.12 --> 01:33:04.000
Right, like you got to quite like, you know, I don't know, this security guard or something. Like,

1117
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.12
hey, don't tell an aster don't whatever because we're going to go in this back door to rob the

1118
01:33:09.12 --> 01:33:13.92
bank or whatever, you know, right? Like so if I'm a bank robber, I want to go rob the bank.

1119
01:33:13.92 --> 01:33:19.84
Hmm, I know the security guard. I'm going to say, hey, I'm going to rob your bank. Don't stop us.

1120
01:33:19.84 --> 01:33:22.88
Or else we're going to kill you with it. Okay, yes, that's coercion. Yeah,

1121
01:33:22.88 --> 01:33:28.56
front to force him to not do something. Right, but he, but the point here is that he has to

1122
01:33:28.56 --> 01:33:33.20
he has to be willing to do it. Right, right, right, you're not just for you could, you could take his

1123
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:38.40
head up where he can't even talk or move. Now, it doesn't matter where he's willing or not, he's not doing it.

1124
01:33:38.40 --> 01:33:42.000
Right, but I'm saying, like, let's say the ability before the bank robbery, it's like when in the

1125
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.08
planning process, you know, maybe the bank robber, but the security guard is my neighbor or something.

1126
01:33:48.08 --> 01:33:51.60
And then I'm going to be like, hey, we're going to rob the bank on your shift.

1127
01:33:51.60 --> 01:33:56.24
Hmm, if so you can't call the cops, you know, you can't sound the alarm or whatever.

1128
01:33:56.24 --> 01:34:00.16
Or kill you or kill you or whatever. It's coercion. Yeah, yeah. It's also a bad plan.

1129
01:34:01.04 --> 01:34:05.52
Yeah, I would think so. But now he's going to tell on everybody before it happens.

1130
01:34:06.72 --> 01:34:11.36
Not if I coerism correctly, you seem to say you better have like his child and the

1131
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:14.08
chunk of your car forever.

1132
01:34:15.36 --> 01:34:20.64
See, it's not that bad. Yeah, you're right. You're right. The idea of using coercion in a competition can be

1133
01:34:20.64 --> 01:34:26.48
misleading if we do not identify the assumptions that support its use. It's often assumed that a

1134
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:32.40
stronger nation can naturally coerce a weaker one into doing what it wants. However, this assumption may

1135
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:37.76
not be true if the weaker nation is willing to absorb or but more punishment than the stronger one

1136
01:34:37.76 --> 01:34:43.52
can or will deliver or stay committed to its goals over a longer period of time. This is

1137
01:34:44.48 --> 01:34:51.84
one of the things that we always have to think about this is in the Vietnam War when we try to say,

1138
01:34:51.84 --> 01:34:57.76
you know what, we can kill 150 of them for every one of us that they kill and we said,

1139
01:34:57.76 --> 01:35:04.72
that's a win. How do we lose that? How to say how you lose it? Those 150 mean less to the

1140
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:08.80
communist government than the one does to the American people in the American government.

1141
01:35:08.80 --> 01:35:13.68
Yeah. When your model places the same value on people for your enemy as it does for yourself

1142
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:17.84
and go, we've run that nobody would tolerate this. We would never tolerate this loss.

1143
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:22.64
Well, they will. And I was thinking the same thing. I was thinking of when the Soviet Union

1144
01:35:22.64 --> 01:35:29.04
innovative Afghanistan. And again, how lopsided that appeared, but in terms of the interest in what

1145
01:35:29.04 --> 01:35:32.48
they were willing to endure and how long they were willing to endure. And sooner or later, it's like,

1146
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:36.40
hey, we can't do this anymore. We're done here. We're done here.

1147
01:35:38.24 --> 01:35:44.08
It says the next week, we call this asymmetry of interest. In this case, the weaker nation has

1148
01:35:44.08 --> 01:35:48.16
the more powerful desire to achieve its interest in the stronger nation. This is, you have to watch

1149
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:53.28
out for this. So you have to watch out for that from as a leader when you're working with a subordinate

1150
01:35:54.40 --> 01:36:01.92
and you start to escalate through the continuum of influence. And you don't recognize that maybe

1151
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:06.96
they don't care if they get fired. And all you think, you know, you want more word out of you

1152
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:14.64
and you're going to get fired. And they don't care. The example as a parent with kids

1153
01:36:14.64 --> 01:36:19.44
probably resonates with a lot of folks. Because as you know, certainly as your kids get older,

1154
01:36:19.44 --> 01:36:25.12
that threat of violence becomes so much less useful. Like, hey, if you do this, I'm going to

1155
01:36:25.12 --> 01:36:29.28
I'm going to ground you. Like, okay, I'll just sneak out of a few sneak out. I'm going to take

1156
01:36:29.28 --> 01:36:35.52
a car away. Cool. And the willingness for them to just outlast you on principle alone or the

1157
01:36:35.52 --> 01:36:39.68
willingness to endure whatever you are going to impose on them, you have to calculate in your mind.

1158
01:36:39.68 --> 01:36:46.96
What they're willing to endure. So you want to hear about some of this calculation? So my, uh,

1159
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:54.08
my son had gotten a little out of line. This is when he was young. And he was in a very

1160
01:36:54.08 --> 01:37:02.56
austere, I put him into a very austere environment to get him to coerced to understand what

1161
01:37:02.56 --> 01:37:10.16
he had done wrong and how we don't do this kind of thing. And it was really strict. And it's

1162
01:37:10.16 --> 01:37:14.88
not by the way, it's no fun for you for the parent, right? We don't want to be strict. We want to

1163
01:37:14.88 --> 01:37:19.04
like have fun and it's all good and we want to buy toys and we want to just, but you, but when you

1164
01:37:19.04 --> 01:37:26.16
go austere, then you're not doing any of that and it's not fun. So over time, as, you know, he,

1165
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:33.36
he was straightening out and he's probably like seven. And eventually, you know, he had gotten,

1166
01:37:33.92 --> 01:37:38.48
you know, some toys back and then he had gotten, you know, his, he could use a pillow again and his

1167
01:37:38.48 --> 01:37:46.48
bedroom and, uh, you know, those kind of creature comforts start to come back and then, you know,

1168
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:53.12
two, three months later, I, you know, something's little spark of like, wait a second.

1169
01:37:54.56 --> 01:38:00.96
And, and what I called this, because he was young, I called this, uh, you know, I have to be strict

1170
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:05.36
with you. So then I started being less and less strict. He started getting some of these privileges back

1171
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:11.36
and then one time he started stepping online a little bit and I said, hey, am, am I going to have to

1172
01:38:11.36 --> 01:38:19.36
get strict with you again? And he said something along the lines of like, I think maybe you should,

1173
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:28.32
so that I can be tougher. I always like, go, I was like, I did not, I was, I didn't want to be

1174
01:38:28.32 --> 01:38:32.64
strict with. I want to, like, let's go back to party time. Yeah, let's go back to, we can, you know,

1175
01:38:32.64 --> 01:38:37.92
play with toys and have a good, he says, maybe, maybe you should, so I can be tougher and I was

1176
01:38:37.92 --> 01:38:44.24
damn it. He just won the test of wheels you want. Like, you can take, go ahead, you should,

1177
01:38:44.24 --> 01:38:50.56
actually, actually, we're one level deeper, like you should. It's in my best interest for you to do that.

1178
01:38:50.56 --> 01:38:55.76
Let's do it immediately. So you got to, you got to pay attention to kids or come at you.

1179
01:38:55.76 --> 01:39:01.92
I'll come at you. Psychological warfare. Information,

1180
01:39:01.92 --> 01:39:09.84
information plays a special role in competition. Narratives play an important part because they are

1181
01:39:09.84 --> 01:39:15.04
what gives meaning to a set of facts. For example, to come, but two competitors may both as

1182
01:39:15.04 --> 01:39:19.84
are to possess a particular island. One of them may have a narrative that explains their claim to

1183
01:39:19.84 --> 01:39:23.92
the island on the basis of historical ownership. The other may have a narrative that says some

1184
01:39:23.92 --> 01:39:28.32
of the people that currently use the island and current possession makes their claim stronger.

1185
01:39:28.32 --> 01:39:34.32
Two narratives compete with each other to give facts and meanings. I got a good question on EF online

1186
01:39:34.32 --> 01:39:39.28
the other day. I think it was EF on the might of an client, but it was along the lines of, hey,

1187
01:39:39.60 --> 01:39:44.000
how do we develop this culture? And my answer was, you need to tell the story of what's going on

1188
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.68
in it. And when we talked about on the spotcast, the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps tells the story,

1189
01:39:49.68 --> 01:39:54.80
yeah, that's how it's going off from the last podcast about about the squad leader makes a difference.

1190
01:39:54.80 --> 01:40:00.64
That thing is primed and ready to rock and roll on the podcast. So the narrative that you tell

1191
01:40:00.64 --> 01:40:07.92
the information that you put out there was just so important. Demonstrating a capability

1192
01:40:07.92 --> 01:40:13.04
and exercise and then think and then communicating so that it affects a competitor's thinking

1193
01:40:14.32 --> 01:40:19.52
is another way Marines use information. Leaders determine what capabilities to reveal and

1194
01:40:19.52 --> 01:40:24.56
when to reveal them as part of a large approach. However, much specifically revealed,

1195
01:40:25.28 --> 01:40:30.32
publicizing adherence to high standards in realistic training can help sustain the Marine

1196
01:40:30.32 --> 01:40:35.44
Corps's reputational advantage and affect the thinking of our nation's competitors. Once again,

1197
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:44.08
the Marine Corps with this manual is increasing their budget. It's a traction for the DOD is what it is.

1198
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:52.96
Marines need to understand the impact of culture when they use information as a competitive tool.

1199
01:40:52.96 --> 01:40:57.36
Cultural differences affect how narratives are interpreted by various audiences. One message

1200
01:40:57.36 --> 01:41:02.08
might be understood in one country in a way that is significantly different from how it is understood.

1201
01:41:02.08 --> 01:41:07.12
And another, Marines must account for this and focus the narratives we use so that our target

1202
01:41:07.12 --> 01:41:11.52
audience understands our message the way that we intend. Yes, know the story.

1203
01:41:11.52 --> 01:41:17.68
Know the story going back to the unraveling podcast. What is your story? Know people's stories.

1204
01:41:21.92 --> 01:41:27.52
The spectrum and styles of competition. The next section. The usual condition of internal

1205
01:41:27.52 --> 01:41:31.20
relations is one of competition across the elements of national power.

1206
01:41:33.76 --> 01:41:39.68
Below the violence threshold, we typically see activities from the non-military aspects of national

1207
01:41:39.68 --> 01:41:45.36
power. For example, economic competition is seen as a national level in the struggle for market

1208
01:41:45.36 --> 01:41:51.20
chair in particular industry or the effort to negotiate favorable terms in a trade agreement.

1209
01:41:51.20 --> 01:41:56.48
Asculation on the spectrum, we might see sharper economic acts like industrial espionage,

1210
01:41:56.48 --> 01:42:00.96
the theft of internet and intellectual property, use of sanctions. What's interesting about this is

1211
01:42:02.16 --> 01:42:03.92
how often do we go to war?

1212
01:42:03.92 --> 01:42:11.68
Right, like if you think about all the interactions that America has globally for the last

1213
01:42:11.68 --> 01:42:18.64
240, 50 years, all these interactions all the time are constantly happening, tariffs and sanctions

1214
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:22.72
and all of these things are happening all the time. And very seldom do we actually pull the

1215
01:42:22.72 --> 01:42:31.44
trigger across the national violence. And that's, we should do that as as infrequently as possible,

1216
01:42:31.44 --> 01:42:36.72
obviously, and you should assess your own leadership in the same spectrum. How often do I have to

1217
01:42:36.72 --> 01:42:41.04
use direct leadership? It should be extremely infrequently.

1218
01:42:48.80 --> 01:42:54.40
Repetitive actions can also move the line up or down over time. This is about how you kind of

1219
01:42:54.40 --> 01:43:01.36
move up and down these continuums all the time. Gradualism and salami slicing, which we talked

1220
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:07.20
about before last one, competitors use these activities in an effort to achieve their aims

1221
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:10.72
without provoking a state of war or even a strong reaction.

1222
01:43:16.96 --> 01:43:21.12
In addition to competing through attraction, coercion and various forms illustrated above

1223
01:43:21.12 --> 01:43:27.12
Marines can also compete by imposing costs. We impose costs on arrival when we develop a

1224
01:43:27.12 --> 01:43:32.32
credible capability and arrival must spend resources in order to try and counter it.

1225
01:43:32.32 --> 01:43:38.32
For example, the Department of Defense has experienced increasing cyber attacks in the past decades.

1226
01:43:38.32 --> 01:43:42.48
This has imposed costs because the Department of Defense has to suspend time and money

1227
01:43:42.72 --> 01:43:47.84
to develop civilian training, the count of those attacks. We can also fast forward when we can

1228
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:53.92
also impose costs during war when we first enforce the adversary to divert resources from their

1229
01:43:53.92 --> 01:44:00.40
preferred actions in order to counter one of our capabilities. Then we get into the threshold of violence.

1230
01:44:02.16 --> 01:44:08.32
The threat of violence and violent acts are competitive tools in international relations. The goal

1231
01:44:08.32 --> 01:44:13.44
of posturing is to affect the decision making of the target to make them so fearful of the

1232
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:17.52
damage they might receive if the posturing escalates to violence that they submit and let the

1233
01:44:17.52 --> 01:44:24.72
posture achieve their goals. And it places one into a favorable position should violence follow.

1234
01:44:24.72 --> 01:44:29.44
Just think about that psychologically. If we start to think about the continuum of influence or leadership

1235
01:44:31.60 --> 01:44:39.92
and you start using direct influence, that's what you're doing. You're crossing over that threshold

1236
01:44:39.92 --> 01:44:44.72
where people are forced to submit. That's why you get the equal and opposite reaction.

1237
01:44:46.40 --> 01:44:51.20
In some cases, the posturing briefly crosses the threshold and violence occurs to demonstrate

1238
01:44:51.20 --> 01:44:57.84
the resolve of the actor. This brief use of violence still has the same aim which is to affect

1239
01:44:57.84 --> 01:45:04.96
the target's decision. Many actors intentionally try to obscure or confuse exactly where this

1240
01:45:04.96 --> 01:45:14.40
threshold lies. That's a good one. Where is that threshold? You ever known someone that just

1241
01:45:14.40 --> 01:45:21.60
crazy eyes, like a crazy eyes person? How about your bouncing at a bar? There's some people where

1242
01:45:21.60 --> 01:45:26.56
you don't know where the line is. They could shank you at any moment. Right? And now you have to

1243
01:45:26.56 --> 01:45:38.80
contend with that. And there's people that proactively proactively prop up that image. It's a good move.

1244
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:47.84
Where you have, you might think that's a good move as a leader. But what you're really doing is

1245
01:45:47.84 --> 01:45:52.88
now what you're doing is you're inducing more fear. And now people don't know when you're going to

1246
01:45:52.88 --> 01:45:58.72
lash out. And so now they're on eggshells and they're afraid to speak up and speak out. And it's a problem.

1247
01:46:05.44 --> 01:46:13.20
This has been, oh, um, they do this to cause enough ambiguity and hesitation that they can

1248
01:46:13.20 --> 01:46:17.52
achieve their aims with little or no interference. This has been true historically. And we'll

1249
01:46:17.52 --> 01:46:21.76
likely increase in the future some rivals use capabilities like certain cyber and space activities

1250
01:46:21.76 --> 01:46:26.96
that have destructive effects but false short of some definitions of violence and effort to obscure

1251
01:46:26.96 --> 01:46:32.24
whether or not they would across the threshold as a push on the on the low. And support a U.S.

1252
01:46:32.24 --> 01:46:36.000
calls Marines perform missions on both sides of the violence threshold. In some case,

1253
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.44
Marines were introduced into situations below the violence threshold. But then a political group

1254
01:46:41.44 --> 01:46:47.44
performed a violent act against U.S. interests. The discipline response of the Marines then occurred

1255
01:46:47.44 --> 01:46:52.80
above the threshold of violence, but the violence was limited and did not reach the level of conventional

1256
01:46:52.80 --> 01:46:57.36
war following these brief periods of violence. The competition again fell below the violence

1257
01:46:57.36 --> 01:47:04.80
threshold in most cases. Now we get into decision making initiative and response.

1258
01:47:06.80 --> 01:47:10.40
You might just call that a whole thing execution. I'm not 100% sure, but you might.

1259
01:47:10.40 --> 01:47:18.96
So Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result of decisions

1260
01:47:18.96 --> 01:47:30.56
or of non-decision. It's so powerful to paint things so clearly. This is whoever wrote this

1261
01:47:30.56 --> 01:47:36.16
opener right here because you know how many people wrote this book Dave. Six six six six

1262
01:47:36.16 --> 01:47:41.60
six. The person at the wrote this section gets a little bonus credit.

1263
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:47.84
Marines are taught that decision making is essential since all actions are the result

1264
01:47:47.84 --> 01:47:54.08
of decisions or non-decisions. If we lack the will required to make a decision then we have

1265
01:47:54.08 --> 01:48:02.56
willingly surrendered the initiative to our full. If we consciously postpone taking action for

1266
01:48:02.56 --> 01:48:06.08
For some reason, this is also a decision.

1267
01:48:06.08 --> 01:48:07.36
So there you go.

1268
01:48:07.36 --> 01:48:10.08
Boom.

1269
01:48:10.08 --> 01:48:11.08
That's the little section.

1270
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:14.12
You got to highlight terminal lands out there.

1271
01:48:14.12 --> 01:48:16.68
I mean, this is what we're talking about.

1272
01:48:16.68 --> 01:48:22.20
Initiative is as important in competition as it is in war, gaining the initiative means

1273
01:48:22.20 --> 01:48:25.04
our competitor must react to us.

1274
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:30.72
We can gain it by presenting a dilemma to our competitor and also by setting the tempo

1275
01:48:30.72 --> 01:48:35.28
of the activity taking place.

1276
01:48:35.28 --> 01:48:38.28
Brian Stan, when he was on here's operational tempo.

1277
01:48:38.28 --> 01:48:42.48
He loved, he loved, he loved everyone's got their move.

1278
01:48:42.48 --> 01:48:45.36
In Gigi, two of them got their, they got that key, a team.

1279
01:48:45.36 --> 01:48:49.16
They got that Camira, they got that heel hook.

1280
01:48:49.16 --> 01:48:52.84
When Brian Stan was on here, I just remember him talking about that operational tempo

1281
01:48:52.84 --> 01:48:59.64
where it's going to, and I'll, that's what he's, that's what this guy's talking about.

1282
01:48:59.64 --> 01:49:01.88
Setting the tempo of the activity.

1283
01:49:01.88 --> 01:49:07.08
Marines must assume that potential competitors understand initiative as well as we do.

1284
01:49:07.08 --> 01:49:10.64
Thus they will take actions in order to gain the initiative.

1285
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.48
Many competitors also seek to create ambiguity about their actions which leads to a problem

1286
01:49:15.48 --> 01:49:17.32
of attribution.

1287
01:49:17.32 --> 01:49:21.24
If we are not certain who performed a certain action, then we cannot attribute that

1288
01:49:21.24 --> 01:49:23.80
action to any particular actor.

1289
01:49:23.80 --> 01:49:27.68
This often delays our response and slows our tempo.

1290
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:33.28
Firstly, if we improve understanding of how of our competitor, we can be primed to attribute

1291
01:49:33.28 --> 01:49:38.16
their actions in ways that slow their tempo instead.

1292
01:49:38.16 --> 01:49:43.84
To know that and to be able to recognize, oh, this isn't just, it's not just that I can't

1293
01:49:43.84 --> 01:49:46.12
figure out exactly who did this.

1294
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:50.44
It's that I am now my Udalupe is slowing down right now.

1295
01:49:50.44 --> 01:49:56.72
Because I think they did it, but I can't be sure.

1296
01:49:56.72 --> 01:50:03.08
While competition essentially always exists, it's intensity varies over the course of time.

1297
01:50:03.08 --> 01:50:07.08
We must also understand that the long timelines involved in competition mean decisions and

1298
01:50:07.08 --> 01:50:10.96
actions sometimes play out over months or years, even decades in some cases.

1299
01:50:10.96 --> 01:50:16.04
This often results in opportunistic behavior as rivals take advantage of conditions to achieve

1300
01:50:16.04 --> 01:50:22.000
their strategic goals without crossing the violence threshold or crossing it briefly.

1301
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.52
And then returning low to threshold before triggering a war.

1302
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:30.88
The journey is often created when conditions suddenly change or temporarily, such as when

1303
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:33.92
a pandemic strikes, a pandemic strikes, which is interesting.

1304
01:50:33.92 --> 01:50:36.48
I don't know if they wrote this before or after.

1305
01:50:36.48 --> 01:50:38.12
I get they probably slid it in there.

1306
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:39.12
You think they slid it in there?

1307
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:41.60
Yeah, I think this was drafted like this last year.

1308
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:47.24
Yeah, they slid it in there such as this diverts attention and resources which creates

1309
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:53.60
a gap for an alert competitor to exploit.

1310
01:50:53.60 --> 01:51:02.56
Having no fixed timeline for achieving goals, plus opportunism also leads to incrementalism,

1311
01:51:02.56 --> 01:51:07.80
which is the effort to achieve a goal by adding together a number of small steps taken

1312
01:51:07.80 --> 01:51:10.52
on a path toward it.

1313
01:51:10.52 --> 01:51:16.96
Achieving our goals in competition requires action which comes from making decisions.

1314
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:21.44
Therefore what Marines are taught for war fighting serves them well here provided, they

1315
01:51:21.44 --> 01:51:26.000
also apply judgment in recognizing how timelines can differ between war and the rest of the

1316
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.20
competition continuum.

1317
01:51:28.20 --> 01:51:32.48
So this idea of incrementalism is something you got to be on the lookout for.

1318
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:40.48
You got to be on the lookout for that slow creeping maneuver that your enemies making.

1319
01:51:40.48 --> 01:51:47.96
And at some point you got to draw the line what I recommend is instead of drawing a line,

1320
01:51:47.96 --> 01:51:51.64
what you do is you incrementally respond.

1321
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:57.92
So when that go, makes it a little maneuver, that's a little bit offensive to me.

1322
01:51:57.92 --> 01:52:00.04
I just don't say well he hasn't really crossed the line.

1323
01:52:00.04 --> 01:52:02.64
I actually give a little bit of a check, a little check.

1324
01:52:02.64 --> 01:52:04.64
That's a little check.

1325
01:52:04.64 --> 01:52:06.32
So from a leadership perspective, what does that mean?

1326
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:12.28
It means when Dave, when Dave decides he's going to spend a little bit too much money on the

1327
01:52:12.28 --> 01:52:18.98
company credit card, I don't just go well, I don't really eat him like cross line.

1328
01:52:18.98 --> 01:52:24.62
I might say, hey Dave, I see I see got it some expenses here that are, what is this?

1329
01:52:24.62 --> 01:52:26.14
What did you buy?

1330
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:32.44
Just check and oh yeah, I just needed some oil for my car.

1331
01:52:32.44 --> 01:52:34.36
Okay, but for your car.

1332
01:52:34.36 --> 01:52:37.12
Yeah, yeah, well, okay.

1333
01:52:37.12 --> 01:52:38.84
Was that for a company trip?

1334
01:52:38.84 --> 01:52:41.16
No, no, no, no, no, I'll change.

1335
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:42.16
I'll talk to you.

1336
01:52:42.16 --> 01:52:43.16
We'll get it straight now.

1337
01:52:43.16 --> 01:52:47.04
Okay, because you're trying to incrementally see if you can start putting real stuff on

1338
01:52:47.04 --> 01:52:49.76
the company credit card.

1339
01:52:49.76 --> 01:52:52.56
No, you can't.

1340
01:52:52.56 --> 01:52:57.68
But if I don't check you, if instead I draw a line in the sand, well now all of a sudden

1341
01:52:57.68 --> 01:53:00.92
you've developed a pattern and you've gotten a habit and you could actually come back

1342
01:53:00.92 --> 01:53:02.40
to me and say well, I'll be doing this for a while.

1343
01:53:02.40 --> 01:53:03.76
I don't want any of that.

1344
01:53:03.76 --> 01:53:06.56
So I'm going to check you.

1345
01:53:06.56 --> 01:53:11.08
Am I going to check you with a, with a hockey stick across the face?

1346
01:53:11.08 --> 01:53:14.76
No, I'm going to give you a little test a little.

1347
01:53:14.76 --> 01:53:15.76
I'm here.

1348
01:53:15.76 --> 01:53:17.64
I see what's happening.

1349
01:53:17.64 --> 01:53:25.32
I don't draw a line in the sand because in a line in the sand can be offensive.

1350
01:53:25.32 --> 01:53:26.32
Yeah.

1351
01:53:26.32 --> 01:53:34.96
And why did you break a rule if you knew the rule is there?

1352
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:40.48
If you broke a rule, I probably did a bad job of explaining that hey man, company credit

1353
01:53:40.48 --> 01:53:44.40
cards, we use them for company business.

1354
01:53:44.40 --> 01:53:49.96
And what we can't do is we can't have a bunch of little charges adding up over time and

1355
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:54.80
then we look up and we, we have lost a bunch of money and spending on things that don't really

1356
01:53:54.80 --> 01:53:56.48
benefit the company.

1357
01:53:56.48 --> 01:54:04.56
So anything that you think you're using for your personal gain or for your personal life

1358
01:54:04.56 --> 01:54:07.52
is not allowed.

1359
01:54:07.52 --> 01:54:11.08
So that's a little bit of a line, but I'm not, I'm not smack in you with it.

1360
01:54:11.08 --> 01:54:13.40
I'm showing it to you.

1361
01:54:13.40 --> 01:54:16.28
And you've got, you have options when you take that approach.

1362
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:20.56
You can, there's a lot of different things you can do in there.

1363
01:54:20.56 --> 01:54:27.64
And the, the problem with the line is that that basically commits you to, to, to a response

1364
01:54:27.64 --> 01:54:32.48
to a course of action that you, it's really, really hard to maneuver away from that.

1365
01:54:32.48 --> 01:54:35.36
And if you're using the line like, hey, if I just draw the line, then, then Jocco's

1366
01:54:35.36 --> 01:54:37.32
not going to cross the line.

1367
01:54:37.32 --> 01:54:40.64
I use it more as a tool to keep you from doing it than it's actually what I'm really willing

1368
01:54:40.64 --> 01:54:41.64
to do.

1369
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:44.28
You have almost no maneuver space there.

1370
01:54:44.28 --> 01:54:45.60
And you talk about that's all the time.

1371
01:54:45.60 --> 01:54:49.36
You want to keep as many options as much maneuverability as you can.

1372
01:54:49.36 --> 01:54:51.84
And that line takes all that away from me.

1373
01:54:51.84 --> 01:54:54.32
And if the line is just a tool to get you to comply.

1374
01:54:54.32 --> 01:54:57.32
And that person, this is talking about an adversary.

1375
01:54:57.32 --> 01:55:03.64
This is an alert adversary looking for ways to commit you that limits anything that limits

1376
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:04.64
your options.

1377
01:55:04.64 --> 01:55:07.28
And certainly I know this about the Marine Corps is something we don't want.

1378
01:55:07.28 --> 01:55:15.92
Isn't a beautiful thing when the line is implied with such strength that I never even

1379
01:55:15.92 --> 01:55:17.92
set it, but you're new, not to cross it.

1380
01:55:17.92 --> 01:55:21.68
How many how many charges have you made on your company credit card for your personal

1381
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:22.68
game?

1382
01:55:22.68 --> 01:55:23.68
The answer is zero.

1383
01:55:23.68 --> 01:55:24.68
Right?

1384
01:55:24.68 --> 01:55:25.68
And not doing that here.

1385
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:27.68
And not out of fear of compliance either.

1386
01:55:27.68 --> 01:55:32.48
Or, or compliance based on fear, but out of a recognition of why that actually is what

1387
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:34.28
you should be doing.

1388
01:55:34.28 --> 01:55:37.72
And there's some things inside here that translate perfectly.

1389
01:55:37.72 --> 01:55:44.24
And there's some things you actually have to think about because this publication, this

1390
01:55:44.24 --> 01:55:48.96
manual is really in a lot of ways talking about competitors.

1391
01:55:48.96 --> 01:55:55.64
And there's a component there that directly aligns well when you're competing with

1392
01:55:55.64 --> 01:55:56.64
you're running a company.

1393
01:55:56.64 --> 01:55:58.16
There's a competitive company.

1394
01:55:58.16 --> 01:56:04.000
But the connection to the leadership piece to your people, you got to kind of translate that

1395
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
a little bit.

1396
01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.60
You don't want to go to war with your people.

1397
01:56:06.60 --> 01:56:10.88
Your goal isn't to set that line to establish your authority so they comply.

1398
01:56:10.88 --> 01:56:12.84
You want to avoid that.

1399
01:56:12.84 --> 01:56:15.44
It almost all costs.

1400
01:56:15.44 --> 01:56:17.32
But you need your into same thing with my kids.

1401
01:56:17.32 --> 01:56:20.40
Do I want my son to know that there's a line?

1402
01:56:20.40 --> 01:56:21.40
Yes.

1403
01:56:21.40 --> 01:56:23.12
He and he knows.

1404
01:56:23.12 --> 01:56:26.48
He almost, well, it happens, but he doesn't cross that line very often.

1405
01:56:26.48 --> 01:56:30.12
I'm not forced to respond in a limited way very often.

1406
01:56:30.12 --> 01:56:31.52
But I want him to know that.

1407
01:56:31.52 --> 01:56:36.24
So let's say there is a street in front of your house, really busy.

1408
01:56:36.24 --> 01:56:41.04
Would you put the line that you're son when he's four years old?

1409
01:56:41.04 --> 01:56:43.04
Would you put the line at the street?

1410
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:44.04
No.

1411
01:56:44.04 --> 01:56:45.04
How no.

1412
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:46.52
You put the line a little further back.

1413
01:56:46.52 --> 01:56:52.28
And would you then escalate like, hey, you can't go past this?

1414
01:56:52.28 --> 01:56:56.76
This is 20 yards from the road where you could get killed.

1415
01:56:56.76 --> 01:56:57.76
That's what we do.

1416
01:56:57.76 --> 01:56:58.76
Yeah.

1417
01:56:58.76 --> 01:57:03.32
Even the actual line where you're going to like give significant punishment because

1418
01:57:03.32 --> 01:57:12.60
you have to impress upon the kid, like my dog, kid dog.

1419
01:57:12.60 --> 01:57:14.20
My dog, I have this.

1420
01:57:14.20 --> 01:57:21.92
And my house, if my dog goes out off my front porch, he's going to be on a street with

1421
01:57:21.92 --> 01:57:24.44
his car.

1422
01:57:24.44 --> 01:57:28.88
I gave him hard corrections when he was a puppy that now I've done leave there.

1423
01:57:28.88 --> 01:57:30.12
He knows what's up.

1424
01:57:30.12 --> 01:57:31.92
He knows that he can't do it.

1425
01:57:31.92 --> 01:57:34.12
So that's where the line isn't.

1426
01:57:34.12 --> 01:57:40.96
He could go off my porch and go another 15 yards before he'd actually get hit.

1427
01:57:40.96 --> 01:57:42.48
But I don't give him that extra 15 yards.

1428
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:43.96
I give him like, okay, here it is.

1429
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:48.68
Don't go across this line and he's been trained and he understands it.

1430
01:57:48.68 --> 01:57:52.76
So that's what you got to watch out for.

1431
01:57:52.76 --> 01:57:57.20
When your dog might not ever make this connection, but the obvious goal with your people

1432
01:57:57.20 --> 01:58:00.000
is that the recognition is that it's in their business.

1433
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.76
You're trying to help them.

1434
01:58:01.76 --> 01:58:05.46
And that's the piece of like, hey, when you're talking about your adversaries and you

1435
01:58:05.46 --> 01:58:07.76
haven't talked a little bit about coercion.

1436
01:58:07.76 --> 01:58:12.60
In some way, we're actually even though our adversaries basically trying to say, hey, don't

1437
01:58:12.60 --> 01:58:13.88
do this.

1438
01:58:13.88 --> 01:58:15.48
This is in your best interest.

1439
01:58:15.48 --> 01:58:17.76
Please don't do this.

1440
01:58:17.76 --> 01:58:20.40
Or, hey, I'm going to really need you to do this.

1441
01:58:20.40 --> 01:58:25.80
But from a leadership standpoint, all those things, even those lines that you draw, the ideal

1442
01:58:25.80 --> 01:58:29.32
situation is usually it's actually what's in their best interest and they're pushing

1443
01:58:29.32 --> 01:58:30.32
against it.

1444
01:58:30.32 --> 01:58:32.96
You might want to find out why they're pushing against that.

1445
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:38.56
Anyway, I just think that that connection of what's in their best interest and that

1446
01:58:38.56 --> 01:58:43.72
that line, I mean, we, you want to be able to maneuver as much as possible all the time

1447
01:58:43.72 --> 01:58:47.16
and keep as many options open as possible.

1448
01:58:47.16 --> 01:58:52.20
So that line should be just be real cautious about drawing that explicitly.

1449
01:58:52.20 --> 01:58:55.92
And if you do, if you can get them to understand why that's there, that's so much more powerful

1450
01:58:55.92 --> 01:58:58.44
than it's just, hey, I'm going to hand me if you hit the cross line.

1451
01:58:58.44 --> 01:59:00.44
Yeah.

1452
01:59:00.44 --> 01:59:02.16
The Y is huge.

1453
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:07.16
And if they don't understand why, then it's an arbitrary thing that you threw up there.

1454
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:09.92
And look, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have that.

1455
01:59:09.92 --> 01:59:13.88
Because if people, you should absolutely have lines where, hey, you cross this line,

1456
01:59:13.88 --> 01:59:19.68
you made it as ethical mistake, you do something that's actively freaking criminal.

1457
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:20.68
You're done.

1458
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:21.68
That's where we're at.

1459
01:59:21.68 --> 01:59:25.28
Just so everybody knows, you do something like that.

1460
01:59:25.28 --> 01:59:26.28
You're done.

1461
01:59:26.28 --> 01:59:27.28
Period end of story.

1462
01:59:27.28 --> 01:59:28.88
There's no, there's not even discussion.

1463
01:59:28.88 --> 01:59:34.56
So don't do that.

1464
01:59:34.56 --> 01:59:39.80
Getting into the conclusion, like war, competition serves policy, but usually does so

1465
01:59:39.80 --> 01:59:46.72
over longer spans of time, these long time lines lead us to look for policies, aims in our enduring

1466
01:59:46.72 --> 01:59:51.28
national interests with aspects of these interests emphasized by current state of domestic

1467
01:59:51.28 --> 01:59:52.92
policies, politics.

1468
01:59:52.92 --> 01:59:57.20
Again, apply that to your personal life, apply that to your business.

1469
01:59:57.20 --> 01:59:58.72
What are you trying to do?

1470
01:59:58.72 --> 02:00:03.52
What are your enduring interests?

1471
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:06.36
Attraction is important concept in our theory of competition.

1472
02:00:06.36 --> 02:00:11.20
It uses incentives and rewards to get another political actor to act differently in ways

1473
02:00:11.20 --> 02:00:12.68
that are aligned with our interests.

1474
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.76
That's what we're doing as a leader.

1475
02:00:14.76 --> 02:00:17.000
We're using attraction.

1476
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.60
We're using coercion.

1477
02:00:19.60 --> 02:00:20.60
We're using the stick.

1478
02:00:20.60 --> 02:00:21.60
We're using the carrot.

1479
02:00:21.60 --> 02:00:22.96
What do we want to use?

1480
02:00:22.96 --> 02:00:27.64
We want to use the carrot as much as possible.

1481
02:00:27.64 --> 02:00:28.64
And you know what?

1482
02:00:28.64 --> 02:00:34.96
We want them to think they found that carrot.

1483
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:37.48
Our version is another important component of our theory.

1484
02:00:37.48 --> 02:00:43.60
It takes two forms, compelence to cause a rival to take action favorable to our goals and

1485
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:47.76
deterrence to cause a rival to not take action.

1486
02:00:47.76 --> 02:00:49.08
That's what you were asking earlier, I think.

1487
02:00:49.08 --> 02:00:53.16
I don't know if I gave you that clear of an answer.

1488
02:00:53.16 --> 02:00:55.64
In war, we impose our will on an enemy.

1489
02:00:55.64 --> 02:01:00.72
With coercion, we need our rivals cooperation because they must decide to comply with

1490
02:01:00.72 --> 02:01:02.20
our wishes.

1491
02:01:02.20 --> 02:01:07.28
And if their cooperation is unwilling, the existence of the Marine Corps is a coercive

1492
02:01:07.28 --> 02:01:09.64
tool for the nation.

1493
02:01:09.64 --> 02:01:16.000
If its competitive advantages advantage is made clear to a rival.

1494
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.76
Competitors act like systems.

1495
02:01:17.76 --> 02:01:23.48
They have many parts that interact with each other in complex, often unpredictable ways.

1496
02:01:23.48 --> 02:01:28.32
This also means competitors have strengths and weaknesses as competition unfolds over time.

1497
02:01:28.32 --> 02:01:35.000
The rival systems can sense what their competitor is trying to do and adapt or evolve in

1498
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.60
an effort to improve their competitive advantage.

1499
02:01:37.60 --> 02:01:39.60
It's always adapting.

1500
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:44.04
These will often blend the threat of violence or the use of violence itself with other

1501
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:47.60
tools to gain an advantage.

1502
02:01:47.60 --> 02:01:53.04
This constantly shifting mixture can get confusing, which is part of the goal.

1503
02:01:53.04 --> 02:01:57.04
Competitors often intend for this confusion to help them reach their goals by causing their

1504
02:01:57.04 --> 02:02:01.92
rivals to hesitate.

1505
02:02:01.92 --> 02:02:08.24
This also helps them gain the initiative so that they can set the pace of the tempo for

1506
02:02:08.24 --> 02:02:09.24
the competition.

1507
02:02:09.24 --> 02:02:14.80
I'm more or two hours deep right now.

1508
02:02:14.80 --> 02:02:15.80
I'm not even getting it.

1509
02:02:15.80 --> 02:02:20.56
Well, the chapter three is next.

1510
02:02:20.56 --> 02:02:28.44
You know, something that I say and I think you and I discussed this the other day on the

1511
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:34.28
phone Dave, the best way to win is when the enemy doesn't even know the fighting.

1512
02:02:34.28 --> 02:02:40.28
What Sunsu was, the supreme, what Sunsu said was the supreme art of war is to subdue the

1513
02:02:40.28 --> 02:02:43.36
enemy without fighting.

1514
02:02:43.36 --> 02:02:46.12
That's what we're trying to do.

1515
02:02:46.12 --> 02:02:54.16
To win, to influence Dave without Dave even knowing that I influenced him.

1516
02:02:54.16 --> 02:02:58.32
I want to maneuver my ideas into your head so that you think they're, they're, they're your

1517
02:02:58.32 --> 02:03:01.08
ideas.

1518
02:03:01.08 --> 02:03:05.96
I want to preemptively remove your will to fight before you even think you should be

1519
02:03:05.96 --> 02:03:10.12
in a fight before before you even think you should be putting up resistance.

1520
02:03:10.12 --> 02:03:12.08
You already are thinking that you don't want to resist.

1521
02:03:12.08 --> 02:03:13.08
That's my goal.

1522
02:03:13.08 --> 02:03:22.44
I want to make you a champion of my cause as if it were your own cause.

1523
02:03:22.44 --> 02:03:25.40
That's what we're trying to make happen.

1524
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:28.04
And by the way, what what makes this easy?

1525
02:03:28.04 --> 02:03:35.24
Er, what makes this and actually makes it easy is when my cause is your cause because

1526
02:03:35.24 --> 02:03:37.000
you're, it helps you.

1527
02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.60
If I'm over here trying to convince you to do something that doesn't help you, man, it's

1528
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:41.72
freaking hard.

1529
02:03:41.72 --> 02:03:50.60
But when I can align my goals with your goals and I can give you ownership, that allows,

1530
02:03:50.60 --> 02:03:58.36
that allows these strategies and tactics for you to get on board with what I want you

1531
02:03:58.36 --> 02:04:06.92
to do and you don't even know that I'm trying to make you do it.

1532
02:04:06.92 --> 02:04:11.12
So this one of the most important things about this manual is simply making you aware

1533
02:04:11.12 --> 02:04:18.80
that you're competing and you have to be aware that you're also influencing all the time

1534
02:04:18.80 --> 02:04:24.64
and you're on that spectrum and you're on that continuum and you're either gaining leadership

1535
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:30.44
capital or you're spending it.

1536
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:34.48
And if you do it right, people are on board.

1537
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:41.08
And the deeper part of that is you are actually propelling them towards victory, form

1538
02:04:41.08 --> 02:04:44.08
or them.

1539
02:04:44.08 --> 02:04:49.68
If you do it right, you're propelling them towards victory and they are happy to be

1540
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:52.20
moving there.

1541
02:04:52.20 --> 02:04:57.96
And if I'm trying to get Dave to do something that he's resistant to and it's going

1542
02:04:57.96 --> 02:05:00.64
to help him in the long run, it's going to help us in the long run.

1543
02:05:00.64 --> 02:05:01.64
Why is he resistant?

1544
02:05:01.64 --> 02:05:04.72
I need to listen to him to see what his resistance is.

1545
02:05:04.72 --> 02:05:11.56
Why is he resisting?

1546
02:05:11.56 --> 02:05:13.84
That's what we're doing.

1547
02:05:13.84 --> 02:05:20.24
We're on a constant continuum of influence.

1548
02:05:20.24 --> 02:05:29.76
Yes, we're competing but we're influencing as leaders.

1549
02:05:29.76 --> 02:05:38.60
We're also competing obviously.

1550
02:05:38.60 --> 02:05:42.80
We want to stay competitive in a multitude of ways.

1551
02:05:42.80 --> 02:05:52.08
We'll say any ways that you can recommend for us to maybe maintain or improve our competitive

1552
02:05:52.08 --> 02:05:53.40
advantage in the world.

1553
02:05:53.40 --> 02:05:54.40
What do you think?

1554
02:05:54.40 --> 02:06:03.28
First one, which I think goes unnoticed and you do good job in reminding us from time

1555
02:06:03.28 --> 02:06:07.08
to time is what game are you playing?

1556
02:06:07.08 --> 02:06:10.32
Isn't that one of the questions you always get?

1557
02:06:10.32 --> 02:06:12.32
What motivates you?

1558
02:06:12.32 --> 02:06:14.000
Right, you get that one a lot.

1559
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:20.16
Still kind of a question that you kind of got to ask yourself a lot of the time.

1560
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:24.38
Because it kind of seems like okay, so getting in shape, for example, or being

1561
02:06:24.38 --> 02:06:26.98
in shape, shape, and shape whatever.

1562
02:06:26.98 --> 02:06:30.78
For some for the average person, whatever that even means because I don't know what that

1563
02:06:30.78 --> 02:06:31.78
actually even is.

1564
02:06:31.78 --> 02:06:37.62
But to wake up before 30 and do and it's not like you're waking up in 430 and doing

1565
02:06:37.62 --> 02:06:45.34
a stretching routine for 10 minutes, like you're kind of going hard.

1566
02:06:45.34 --> 02:06:46.62
That's every single day.

1567
02:06:46.62 --> 02:06:49.62
Not to say you're going full speed every single day.

1568
02:06:49.62 --> 02:06:54.70
But I'm just saying your routine is like the average person not going to do that.

1569
02:06:54.70 --> 02:06:57.06
So you're over here going hard.

1570
02:06:57.06 --> 02:06:58.06
But why?

1571
02:06:58.06 --> 02:06:59.06
You know?

1572
02:06:59.06 --> 02:07:00.06
Competitive advantage.

1573
02:07:00.06 --> 02:07:01.06
Yes.

1574
02:07:01.06 --> 02:07:02.06
Competitive advantage.

1575
02:07:02.06 --> 02:07:03.06
Exactly.

1576
02:07:03.06 --> 02:07:05.06
So what I'm saying is in your head it's there.

1577
02:07:05.06 --> 02:07:08.70
But I think in like a lot of our head this segment is not always there like we've got

1578
02:07:08.70 --> 02:07:10.30
to kind of get reminded everyone's own.

1579
02:07:10.30 --> 02:07:14.94
You know, just to confirm things in the world.

1580
02:07:14.94 --> 02:07:16.82
You know, in discipline it goes freedom field manual.

1581
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:24.62
But let's talk about like how if you exercise, you'll be sharper mentally sharper.

1582
02:07:24.62 --> 02:07:30.62
And then hearing that chess player the other day Gary Kasparov talk about how if you're

1583
02:07:30.62 --> 02:07:32.78
in shape it's going to help you win at chess.

1584
02:07:32.78 --> 02:07:36.34
I was like keep working out people.

1585
02:07:36.34 --> 02:07:38.54
Keep working out people.

1586
02:07:38.54 --> 02:07:39.94
That's what you need to do.

1587
02:07:39.94 --> 02:07:40.94
Yeah.

1588
02:07:40.94 --> 02:07:44.86
And you're kind of always your mind's kind of seems to be anyway always kind of in that

1589
02:07:44.86 --> 02:07:50.18
zone where it's like you're kind of looking for some kind of advantage or something to add

1590
02:07:50.18 --> 02:07:52.54
to, you know, your deal or whatever.

1591
02:07:52.54 --> 02:07:56.58
But for the every person, I think some of us don't do that all the time because we kind

1592
02:07:56.58 --> 02:07:59.02
of forget or maybe to get distracted or whatever.

1593
02:07:59.02 --> 02:08:00.06
Maybe that's the same thing.

1594
02:08:00.06 --> 02:08:03.50
But where that's why people they'll work out less.

1595
02:08:03.50 --> 02:08:05.62
More things going on all this stuff, right?

1596
02:08:05.62 --> 02:08:06.62
So they forget.

1597
02:08:06.62 --> 02:08:07.62
Yeah.

1598
02:08:07.62 --> 02:08:08.62
Yeah.

1599
02:08:08.62 --> 02:08:11.62
You got that.

1600
02:08:11.62 --> 02:08:12.62
Let's face it.

1601
02:08:12.62 --> 02:08:17.42
You pour all your efforts into your job.

1602
02:08:17.42 --> 02:08:20.86
Your family and your physical health are going to fall.

1603
02:08:20.86 --> 02:08:25.26
If you pour all your efforts into your family, your job and your physical health is going

1604
02:08:25.26 --> 02:08:26.26
to fail.

1605
02:08:26.26 --> 02:08:30.54
If you pour all your efforts into your physical health, your job and your family are

1606
02:08:30.54 --> 02:08:33.02
going to fail.

1607
02:08:33.02 --> 02:08:37.06
So we have to be balanced.

1608
02:08:37.06 --> 02:08:41.14
If you let the physical one fall apart, that's going to negatively impact the other.

1609
02:08:41.14 --> 02:08:43.50
I actually, they all, they all impact each other, right?

1610
02:08:43.50 --> 02:08:44.50
They all impact each other.

1611
02:08:44.50 --> 02:08:50.10
But let's face it as you pointed out on one of the earliest of these podcasts.

1612
02:08:50.10 --> 02:08:55.22
The physical one will help you across the board in all aspects of the game.

1613
02:08:55.22 --> 02:08:56.62
So the way, maybe the best game.

1614
02:08:56.62 --> 02:08:57.62
The game.

1615
02:08:57.62 --> 02:08:59.74
The game straight up.

1616
02:08:59.74 --> 02:09:03.02
In a way, the best way, the best strategy, you know, instead of pouring everything you

1617
02:09:03.02 --> 02:09:07.82
have into your XYZ, whatever one thing you align them all and understand that they're

1618
02:09:07.82 --> 02:09:12.46
all this, what it call it in business, vertically integrated and whatever.

1619
02:09:12.46 --> 02:09:13.46
Right?

1620
02:09:13.46 --> 02:09:14.46
Just called the path.

1621
02:09:14.46 --> 02:09:15.46
The path.

1622
02:09:15.46 --> 02:09:16.46
Yeah, same thing.

1623
02:09:16.46 --> 02:09:18.74
So look, I'm going to exercise, be capable on duty, get to.

1624
02:09:18.74 --> 02:09:24.10
I'm going to improve all my applicable skills.

1625
02:09:24.10 --> 02:09:28.34
So I can be a better whatever those things are, whatever you are.

1626
02:09:28.34 --> 02:09:31.06
You seem to have to know what you're going with.

1627
02:09:31.06 --> 02:09:32.90
People should get supplements for more than you may.

1628
02:09:32.90 --> 02:09:33.90
Is that what you're going with?

1629
02:09:33.90 --> 02:09:36.94
I think I just saw little connection getting made.

1630
02:09:36.94 --> 02:09:41.94
I'm going to make that connection in 20 minutes.

1631
02:09:41.94 --> 02:09:42.94
I'm down.

1632
02:09:42.94 --> 02:09:43.94
I'm down.

1633
02:09:43.94 --> 02:09:47.42
See that kind of artistic maneuver.

1634
02:09:47.42 --> 02:09:50.62
The intellectual sharpness as you bring it in for the big win and all of a sudden you're

1635
02:09:50.62 --> 02:09:53.66
talking about how we're going to get some supplementation.

1636
02:09:53.66 --> 02:09:55.42
I'm hype on that.

1637
02:09:55.42 --> 02:10:01.26
But when we start going 12 minutes and we're talking about alignment and vertical integration,

1638
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:02.26
this is an important thing.

1639
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:03.26
Okay.

1640
02:10:03.26 --> 02:10:04.26
I'll just say it.

1641
02:10:04.26 --> 02:10:08.10
Now you did have one person respond on social media that they are listening.

1642
02:10:08.10 --> 02:10:09.10
Right now.

1643
02:10:09.10 --> 02:10:13.10
So that person is happy that you're going down the path of whatever you're going down.

1644
02:10:13.10 --> 02:10:14.10
Hey, look.

1645
02:10:14.10 --> 02:10:15.10
Which is fine.

1646
02:10:15.10 --> 02:10:16.10
Oh, right.

1647
02:10:16.10 --> 02:10:18.54
Well, hey, better to be over-inform then under-informed.

1648
02:10:18.54 --> 02:10:19.54
Okay.

1649
02:10:19.54 --> 02:10:20.54
So, hey, look data.

1650
02:10:20.54 --> 02:10:24.22
I don't know if we can make that necessarily a blanket statement because I think

1651
02:10:24.22 --> 02:10:26.70
the people that are right now are questioning.

1652
02:10:26.70 --> 02:10:27.70
Well, I love this.

1653
02:10:27.70 --> 02:10:29.74
I mean, in this scenario that we're in at this moment.

1654
02:10:29.74 --> 02:10:30.94
Hey, thanks for helping it alone.

1655
02:10:30.94 --> 02:10:31.94
Okay.

1656
02:10:31.94 --> 02:10:32.94
You know, you're a little bump.

1657
02:10:32.94 --> 02:10:33.94
Push.

1658
02:10:33.94 --> 02:10:34.94
You do a great job.

1659
02:10:34.94 --> 02:10:35.94
A little influence.

1660
02:10:35.94 --> 02:10:36.94
A little influence.

1661
02:10:36.94 --> 02:10:38.94
Anyway, all right.

1662
02:10:38.94 --> 02:10:39.94
Cool.

1663
02:10:39.94 --> 02:10:43.26
Where we're here trying to compete, stay competitive, improve, and maintain our competitive

1664
02:10:43.26 --> 02:10:44.26
advantage.

1665
02:10:44.26 --> 02:10:45.26
Okay.

1666
02:10:45.26 --> 02:10:46.26
Look, we need supplementation.

1667
02:10:46.26 --> 02:10:47.26
Yeah, quickly that worked.

1668
02:10:47.26 --> 02:10:48.26
Yeah.

1669
02:10:48.26 --> 02:10:50.66
I kind of set you up like, hey, how can we maintain competitiveness?

1670
02:10:50.66 --> 02:10:51.90
You could sit boom and you were there.

1671
02:10:51.90 --> 02:10:53.78
I know many things like my idea too.

1672
02:10:53.78 --> 02:10:54.78
There wasn't a lot of money.

1673
02:10:54.78 --> 02:10:55.78
I did.

1674
02:10:55.78 --> 02:10:56.78
I didn't.

1675
02:10:56.78 --> 02:11:00.78
The scene in my head and man, that was like, man, the best idea ever came up, seemingly.

1676
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:01.78
That was a good job.

1677
02:11:01.78 --> 02:11:02.78
Yeah.

1678
02:11:02.78 --> 02:11:03.78
Okay.

1679
02:11:03.78 --> 02:11:06.10
So I'm taking discipline and discipline.

1680
02:11:06.10 --> 02:11:08.66
Go, that's probably why my brain is so sharp.

1681
02:11:08.66 --> 02:11:09.66
Let me say something.

1682
02:11:09.66 --> 02:11:11.30
Let me say something.

1683
02:11:11.30 --> 02:11:14.02
Because even as you're talking about this, people aren't thinking, okay, what

1684
02:11:14.02 --> 02:11:16.14
does this all mean?

1685
02:11:16.14 --> 02:11:18.22
Here's what, here's a bonus thing.

1686
02:11:18.22 --> 02:11:20.30
Because we repeat a lot of the same stuff, right?

1687
02:11:20.30 --> 02:11:21.30
Sure.

1688
02:11:21.30 --> 02:11:22.30
We certainly seem to repeat.

1689
02:11:22.30 --> 02:11:23.30
What are you writing now?

1690
02:11:23.30 --> 02:11:24.30
Nothing.

1691
02:11:24.30 --> 02:11:25.30
Just continue, please, with your thoughts.

1692
02:11:25.30 --> 02:11:26.30
You're making notes.

1693
02:11:26.30 --> 02:11:28.30
That's the indication of that.

1694
02:11:28.30 --> 02:11:29.30
It's that.

1695
02:11:29.30 --> 02:11:30.30
We added in stuff.

1696
02:11:30.30 --> 02:11:31.30
Please, please continue.

1697
02:11:31.30 --> 02:11:32.30
Are we having things?

1698
02:11:32.30 --> 02:11:34.30
You can add it now.

1699
02:11:34.30 --> 02:11:35.30
Check this out.

1700
02:11:35.30 --> 02:11:38.86

1705
02:11:52.42 --> 02:11:53.42
Okay.

1706
02:11:53.42 --> 02:11:55.90
Supercruo oil, vitamin D, discipline in some form.

1707
02:11:55.90 --> 02:11:56.90
Okay.

1708
02:11:56.90 --> 02:11:57.90
Okay.

Single day.

1710
02:11:58.90 --> 02:11:59.90
Dave, what are you on, daily?

1711
02:11:59.90 --> 02:12:00.90
Cold war.

1712
02:12:00.90 --> 02:12:01.90
What about the cold oil?

1713
02:12:01.90 --> 02:12:06.90
I guess I have to remember, I have such a stash of this that I forget.

1714
02:12:06.90 --> 02:12:07.90
Geez.

1715
02:12:07.90 --> 02:12:13.18
So, so I am, I am, I'm almost ashamed to say that.

1716
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:17.70
But the only one I don't have a huge stash of is Cold War.

1717
02:12:17.70 --> 02:12:21.54
I think you said vitamin D, maybe that's what you were alluding to.

1718
02:12:21.54 --> 02:12:22.38
What did I say?

1719
02:12:22.38 --> 02:12:23.70
You said vitamin D.

1720
02:12:23.70 --> 02:12:24.70
Yeah.

1721
02:12:24.70 --> 02:12:25.82
I say Cold War.

1722
02:12:25.82 --> 02:12:29.66
That one is now, that one is now on regular shipping.

1723
02:12:29.66 --> 02:12:30.50
Okay.

1724
02:12:30.50 --> 02:12:31.50
Okay.

1725
02:12:31.50 --> 02:12:34.50
So, if you go on that, if you subscribe, yes.

1726
02:12:34.50 --> 02:12:38.54
And of course go, then you get free shipping, yeah, which is pretty awesome.

1727
02:12:38.54 --> 02:12:39.54
Yes, sure.

1728
02:12:39.54 --> 02:12:44.78
So, if you want to get any of these items on a regular basis, which we recommend

1729
02:12:44.78 --> 02:12:45.78

1730
02:12:45.78 --> 02:12:46.78
Mm-hmm.

1731
02:12:46.78 --> 02:12:47.78

1733
02:12:50.66 --> 02:12:51.66
Okay.

1734
02:12:51.66 --> 02:12:52.66
Done.

1735
02:12:52.66 --> 02:12:53.66
So, let me go down the list.

1736
02:12:53.66 --> 02:12:54.66
These are all beneficial things.

1737
02:12:54.66 --> 02:12:57.34
Maintain the competitive edge, joint warfare for your joints.

1738
02:12:57.34 --> 02:12:58.66
Don't worry about that stuff.

1739
02:12:58.66 --> 02:13:00.06
You don't have to worry about your joints anymore.

1740
02:13:00.06 --> 02:13:01.06
Super cruel oil.

1741
02:13:01.06 --> 02:13:02.06
Same deal.

1742
02:13:02.06 --> 02:13:05.58
General health are other benefits, vitamin T3, and it is another one.

1743
02:13:05.58 --> 02:13:10.34
Also cold war, this for immunity and other health benefits.

1744
02:13:10.34 --> 02:13:12.70
Better to have health benefits than health.

1745
02:13:12.70 --> 02:13:14.10
Deutch events.

1746
02:13:14.10 --> 02:13:15.10
Okay.

1747
02:13:15.10 --> 02:13:16.10
Okay.

1748
02:13:16.10 --> 02:13:19.70
You're like, that's the threat, you're like, actually, you're here.

1749
02:13:19.70 --> 02:13:22.28
So, you should release operations that I don't know what you're saying, and the you

1750
02:13:22.28 --> 02:13:23.28
hold it off credit.

1751
02:13:23.28 --> 02:13:24.28
Negative credit.

1752
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:26.30
Credit is in the you understand credit.

1753
02:13:26.30 --> 02:13:27.30
Right.

1754
02:13:27.30 --> 02:13:29.98
Anyway, back to the supplements, discipline.

1755
02:13:29.98 --> 02:13:33.02
discipline go. So discipline the powder for your brain for your body

1756
02:13:33.02 --> 02:13:38.02
discipline go, brain body just on the go quicker, delivery system, capsules, and

1757
02:13:38.02 --> 02:13:41.74
also the energy drink form. It's a healthy energy drink by the way if we didn't

1758
02:13:41.74 --> 02:13:46.54
already know, even though we do, that is those are the facts. Also, milk for extra

1759
02:13:46.54 --> 02:13:51.62
protein form and dessert, super delicious tasting protein as a dessert. Yeah,

1760
02:13:51.62 --> 02:13:54.94
you could say extra protein where you just say, oh, if you want also one of

1761
02:13:54.94 --> 02:13:58.58
dessert, cool, you can get some milk. You get them at wall, you get the drinks,

1762
02:13:58.58 --> 02:14:03.62
you can get the the ready to drink the cans at wall wall all the wall

1763
02:14:03.62 --> 02:14:09.46
was by the way, they're in there and vitamin shop. So you can you can get them there

1764
02:14:09.46 --> 02:14:15.42
or you can get them at origin main.com and if you get a subscription, there's a

1765
02:14:15.42 --> 02:14:19.46
little issue with the wall us in area. What is it? I got a lot of videos of

1766
02:14:19.46 --> 02:14:23.26
people just going in there and cleaning it out. So people going there with

1767
02:14:23.26 --> 02:14:28.50
coolers, yeah, going to the shelves of wall and empty every can. So be

1768
02:14:28.50 --> 02:14:33.18
born. Yeah, they're getting after people are getting after it. But the great

1769
02:14:33.18 --> 02:14:38.22
great thing is we started off in Florida and it was sort of a test run for

1770
02:14:38.22 --> 02:14:45.22
walla and everyone went after those. After those things, those and walla and

1771
02:14:45.22 --> 02:14:50.90
just almost like less than a month into it, less than a month into a three

1772
02:14:50.90 --> 02:14:55.70
month trial walla came to us and said, we want you know the stores. So thank

1773
02:14:55.70 --> 02:15:01.14
you for for getting after it and walla was going to deliver walla was also in the

1774
02:15:01.14 --> 02:15:04.90
game because they get tagged a lot from people out there shopping walla and

1775
02:15:04.90 --> 02:15:08.98
they always get a good reply. Awesome. Interesting that yeah, I saw that with a guy

1776
02:15:08.98 --> 02:15:13.18
with the cooler was like a bin and he was like boom, cool. I was like, let's

1777
02:15:13.18 --> 02:15:16.66
interesting. I don't think I've ever been really that compelled to do that with

1778
02:15:16.66 --> 02:15:20.82
it with the like a drink or whatever. I'm saying under what circumstances would I

1779
02:15:20.82 --> 02:15:25.46
be? And then I thought back to it was like maybe like four days or so before

1780
02:15:25.46 --> 02:15:30.42
it were I texted be little with the emergency scenario because I was only on my

1781
02:15:30.42 --> 02:15:34.86
last one. Because I think they'll send it. They'll send it in and because usually

1782
02:15:34.86 --> 02:15:39.62
I don't go to my last one. But what if I'm on my last one and I'm like, wait a

1783
02:15:39.62 --> 02:15:44.90
second I can go to walla and restock. Then you're bringing a cooler. So it makes

1784
02:15:44.90 --> 02:15:47.94
sense. Exactly. Right. That's one other good reason you got here on a

1785
02:15:47.94 --> 02:15:52.46
subscription. That day doesn't come. That day does not come. And we don't want

1786
02:15:52.46 --> 02:15:57.10
that day to come. So yes, you mentioned originate.com. That's where you can get it

1787
02:15:57.10 --> 02:16:05.18
as well. Also an originamine.com. You can get you just to stuff gear, jegees,

1788
02:16:05.18 --> 02:16:10.66
rashguards, against stuff also shirts and sweats and cool clothes as well. This

1789
02:16:10.66 --> 02:16:14.86
is all American made stuff by the way. Big deal. Yeah, you just do competitive

1790
02:16:14.86 --> 02:16:20.30
advantage. Yes, competitive advantage to have not slave labor but awesome

1791
02:16:20.30 --> 02:16:25.38
people. Yeah, you you mentioned that like slave labor like when you kind of

1792
02:16:25.38 --> 02:16:29.54
you know the front end of the slave labor situation, right? You could just be like,

1793
02:16:29.54 --> 02:16:32.62
oh yeah, we'll just make it super cheap. You know, you guys make it and we can

1794
02:16:32.62 --> 02:16:35.42
sell it for higher or whatever. But it's own cares about what they're doing on

1795
02:16:35.42 --> 02:16:39.02
every step. You know, like manufacturer like, okay, my job is to do this and

1796
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:42.46
do this and to do this and I'm going to just do it. But I care about doing it.

1797
02:16:42.46 --> 02:16:46.90
Brother, it's way better. Like quality wise in every capacity and sustainable.

1798
02:16:46.90 --> 02:16:50.66
Yeah. So yes, that is a competitive advantage. What if everyone on your team

1799
02:16:50.66 --> 02:16:52.90
cared about what their job was?

1800
02:16:52.90 --> 02:16:56.02
Brother, that's all right. And so you just nailed that.

1801
02:16:56.02 --> 02:16:58.78
Sure. I agree that that is the case.

1802
02:16:58.78 --> 02:17:02.98
Unless back to how we can all support ourselves.

1803
02:17:02.98 --> 02:17:07.42
Jocquad was a store called Jocquad store and this is where you can represent your

1804
02:17:07.42 --> 02:17:12.38
apparel while you're on the path maintaining your advantage competitively.

1805
02:17:12.38 --> 02:17:16.70
We have shirts and hoodies and hats. They all say disciplinicals freedom or

1806
02:17:16.70 --> 02:17:23.18
something along those lines. Good. Good. Same thing in a way. Kind of part of this.

1807
02:17:23.18 --> 02:17:25.50
Anyway, you understand what I'm saying?

1808
02:17:25.50 --> 02:17:28.98
Good stuff on there. There's a T-shirt club called this shirt locker.

1809
02:17:28.98 --> 02:17:32.22
S-H-U-S. Thank you to whoever made that suggestion.

1810
02:17:32.22 --> 02:17:36.62
Yeah, that's a good one. It was a lot better than the other name that we had been

1811
02:17:36.62 --> 02:17:39.66
using here. The thing is to be honest, like the more I think about it, the

1812
02:17:39.66 --> 02:17:42.70
shirt locker is like it didn't even matter what the name was before.

1813
02:17:42.70 --> 02:17:45.14
That one would probably be better because it's like perfect.

1814
02:17:45.14 --> 02:17:47.14
That's the perfect name. The shirt locker.

1815
02:17:47.14 --> 02:17:52.90
Yep. And that is also a subscription scenario where you can get kind of different types of shirts

1816
02:17:52.90 --> 02:17:58.74
from us. A little not hardcore disciplinicals freedom stuff, but some fun stuff.

1817
02:17:58.74 --> 02:18:01.70
It's cool. It's cool. It'll deal. So you look into that. That's for you.

1818
02:18:01.70 --> 02:18:02.50
Do that.

1819
02:18:02.50 --> 02:18:04.06
Jocquad store.com.

1820
02:18:04.06 --> 02:18:09.86
Subscribe to this podcast. You can also join us on the underground.

1821
02:18:09.86 --> 02:18:15.38
Go to jockelunderground.com. It's alternative podcasts.

1822
02:18:15.38 --> 02:18:21.98
Some amplifying information. Some behind the scenes. Some Q&A.

1823
02:18:21.98 --> 02:18:27.58
Some live stuff. And we're going to actually record yet another underground podcast right

1824
02:18:27.58 --> 02:18:34.82
now about going into some other facets of these discussions.

1825
02:18:34.82 --> 02:18:39.42
And and reason we're doing that. We don't. We need to have an alternative platform.

1826
02:18:39.42 --> 02:18:45.30
And we don't want to take on sponsors where we have to say what they say us.

1827
02:18:45.30 --> 02:18:53.58
Say what they tell us to say. And then also not say what they tell us not to say.

1828
02:18:53.58 --> 02:18:59.34
We don't want to do that. We definitely don't want to have anyone critiquing how certain

1829
02:18:59.34 --> 02:19:06.82
people on this podcast talk about the items that are discussed.

1830
02:19:06.82 --> 02:19:10.58
Oh, David. Look at David. Look at the two.

1831
02:19:10.58 --> 02:19:15.22
Hey, because eight dollars and 18 cents a month or you can even if you can't afford eight dollars

1832
02:19:15.22 --> 02:19:19.86
and eight, you can send some of. But by the way, this is what supports this podcast.

1833
02:19:19.86 --> 02:19:25.06
Two, but we don't want to have the jockel podcast behind a pay wall.

1834
02:19:25.06 --> 02:19:29.38
I always say firewall and you like correcting me right before I even said it, which is good.

1835
02:19:29.38 --> 02:19:31.54
Because I saw you right my mouth.

1836
02:19:31.54 --> 02:19:36.82
Little and sink is at that. Yeah. Yeah. Let's sink. Yeah. Well, a firewall is an actual thing in

1837
02:19:36.82 --> 02:19:39.70
like programming or something like that. Okay. Well, we just have a we don't want to put it

1838
02:19:39.70 --> 02:19:43.22
behind a pay wall because we don't ever move over to here. And so that's why eight dollars and

1839
02:19:43.22 --> 02:19:48.66
18 cents a month. If you if you can't afford that, it's okay. Email assistance at jockel

On iTunes, if you need a little help, get no for a little. Whatever moment moment, momentary weakness.

Maybe permanent weakness. Yeah. Maybe you be listening to that thing a lot. If you have
