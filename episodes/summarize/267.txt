The iterative nature of competition matched to discipline use of the Udalupe will help planners determine how aggressive one should be in pursuit of campaign goals acknowledging these long timelines leads us to consider the consistency of our competitive goals If we believe we may need to take many small steps towards a goal over the course of months years decades or decades Then our objectives should remain relatively stable during that time This is why we look first to our national interest before we derive our competition in campaigning goals Once those are determined we then decide how Marines can support achieving them The campaigning mindset needs to be applied When considering competitive activities especially long term thinking and integrating our actions with others Consistency and sustainability lead us to consider the pace or tempo of competition This tempo is often driven by a cycle of action and counteraction Each campaign and I'm skipping through some stuff here each campaign has a narrative which provides context And purpose for the competition our narrative competes with that of our rival To defeat a competitors narrative we need to replace it with a more persuasive one simply denying someone story may actually reinforce it in the minds of target audience You can't just you can't just that that rumor is gonna come You got to tell the story you got to tell the right story that is why we need to replace it when they more compelling story Sorry next line For example Two firms may sell an identical commodity their respective narratives will explain why they are the right choice to win the business of a particular customer The stronger narrative will displace the weaker one conclusion our War fighting philosophy of maneuver warfare is the philosophy that animates our approach to competition as well So for for the Marine Corps maneuver warfare is the way we are thinking about everything Marines take the same flexible and opportunistic approach to competition as they do towards fighting battles The most important tenant of maneuver warfare is to orient on the enemy and this influence is also felt in competition We orient on our competitor Now This one when I read this I was like immediately freaked out because I saw it with most important thing of maneuver warfare is is To orient on the enemy and I was like oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Tenet of maneuver warfare Because maneuver warfare without leadership doesn't do anything leadership's the most important thing The words people picked to describe things can also reveal biases or tendencies which is what I just said and these things can be exploited Our competitors across the globe recognize Western societies tendency to think of themselves as either in a condition of at-piece or at-war This is a significant contrast from Maltzay Duns Political politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with with bloodshed Maltzay's the word war He chose the word war to describe the enduring relationship between political actors and an essence said that while The relationship is violent some of the time it's always at a state of war Marines must consider how using words like these differs from how the United States describes it and the corresponding impact these differences might have on the ways and means arrival might use in competition Man they're think you're thinking we're in competition they're thinking we're at war The culture of a group can be defined as the groups accumulated shared learning of how to solve internal and external problems The group this is culture by the way, I miss that the title of this is culture the culture of a group can be defined as the group's accumulated shared learning of how to solve Internal and external problems The group then determines that this shared learning is valid so the new members learn it as they as the correct way to perceive it to perceive Think feel and behave That's what culture is New members come on and that culture is gonna tell them how to perceive things how to think how to feel and how to behave The group then start to take this accumulated learning for granted As a system of beliefs Values and behavioral norms this is culture this is what you're trying to build inside your company this what you're trying to build inside your team This what you're trying to build inside your Pultoon When this happens the system turns into based turns into basic assumptions and eventually drops out of the out of conscious awareness You want that culture so ingrained that people aren't even thinking about it What's the deal? Boy if you're in charge of a company don't you hope and pray that everyone in your company every division in your company Everyone on your team is thinking about your vital interests inside your organization and thinking ahead we establish that what we want to accomplish why and how this provides a vision for Succeeding in competition which in turn helps align the actions taken towards reaching the goals In both the near and long-term we orient on our competitor to develop our understanding of their system We continually refine our models of their system so that we can focus on their weaknesses including increasing our understanding of how their culture affects their decision making process Man, you got to know what your competitors thinking They just say this over and over again Similarly, we must try to see ourselves through our competitors eyes in order to identify our own vulnerabilities that makes that they may try to exploit To influence the future we consider how we can exploit our competitors weakness while protecting our own This usually takes the form of planning I think beyond planning it takes the Takes the form should take the form or at least extend to the form of a war gaming or Red selling or whatever you want to call it totally Forsoin force training our Plans will not always produce a detailed time-tailed move of events as we accept that competition's may unfold over a long time Instead, we attempt to shape the general conditions of the competition since marine support our larger national competitive effort We first need you to determine who we are supporting this support limited only by our imaginations and available resources can take a variety of forms Across all our operating domains for example our force posture exists in all domains and can contribute to the deterrence in these domains Through the diplomatic and informational elements of power it can also improve relationships with our allies and partners Force posture can help develop ties with partner militaries that lead to attracting top performing international officers to our service schools Which further deep in the relationship expanding relationship like this shapes our campaign of competition by increasing the potential number of competitive action We can take think about what you can do inside your organization if you're in business If you just take that section about working with other people get training other what if you took people from other companies? So we always knew what our threats can do with it's kind of pretty binary pretty linear They can do this they can do that we can do this me that this problem You know get solved by when you shoot a missile where you maneuver things like that when I went up to top Gonna became the adversary officer which mean my job for about a year was to pretend to be a Russian pilot basically They'll plans build tactics do things and my what I was supposed to see the world through their eyes and that actually helped me learn that when I see what they're doing or other people are thinking or saying is Why are they seeing the same thing differently and that to me leads to what are they trying to accomplish One more example, which I think is important though that's the lyrics and I bring it up is the the ability to Separate your feelings from your behavior because usually like if you're just not doing any Mental work or whatever Whatever you feel you're gonna your behavior is gonna reflect that specifically Say that doesn't take much work, but if you're and the more intense the feeling the harder work it's gonna be to Change your behavior so it's not based on those emotions feelings whatever So when you can separate those two that's work. Do you know I'm little let's just say disappointed in your whole approach on that section today I don't know if you like feeling down or maybe you didn't drink enough discipline I didn't feel any of that what you just said oh like my energy was all energy was low I'm not like you like let me let me let me give everyone a little something to be happy about since you're You know not feeling it today apparently check this out check this out if you want to get any of this stuff With free shipping from origin main calm all you have to do is subscribe and that's a good call because then you're not gonna Miss you're not gonna look in your cupboard one day Is covered in east coast word? We're gonna look we're gonna look and utilize and work with and cooperate with as many different Elements as we possibly can to to get the best advantage we can over our rivals this Same mindset applies to combining the complementary characteristics of Marines with other partners whether they're from other US government department or from an allied country We orient on the competitor because we want to make sure the combined arms dilemma We intend to present in competition is actually a problem for them this Mindset leads Marines to develop holistic plans designed to reach specific goals in both war and along the larger competition Continuum in competition the idea of combined arms extends through joint force inner agency to allies and partners So we don't necessarily have we don't we don't have to be at war at all To go out and work and combine our efforts with other Other elements that can give us advantages Next section campaign of competition Embracing the mind embracing the competition mindset leads to the realization that the Marine Corps plays and important But supporting role and our nation's various competitions now I have to take a pause there because this idea of supporting role in the military It's the the word supporting in the military is Can be taken as offensive right because what it means is you know if Dave's got a platoon and I've got a platoon Dave and Dave is assigned as the supporting platoon and I'm the main effort Dave is Inferior to me but I don't think we have that book check It's a hard book to get I mean it's No, I'm okay people use words to describe things around the world around them and to describe what is happening in the world These words influence their actions language affects groups of people in a similar way as the words they choose Provide the meaning they want to communicate to each other the words they choose provide the meaning They want to communicate to each other the meaning that is understood then calls it the group to act in one way or another Note that this applies to the word competition In the Western world the word has various meanings that bring to mind sporting events or perhaps two businesses trying to win market share When we add descriptors to the word like great power competition or nation state competition the context The descriptors provide a just our understanding of the competition we face Have you ever heard that The Eskimos have a hundred different words for snow Fact or fiction Were you at I don't know you're right Compare the Western use of the word competition to words Offeritarian governments use to label the same relationship the contrast helps us see How language might shape behavior for example some rivals use struggle or Embracing while fighting Which is a pretty cool thing we call that jujitsu by the way Embracing or fighting to name what we know is competition to most Marines hearing something described as struggle or fighting would shape an initial reaction Quite a bit different than if we had heard described as competition Because of the mental shortcuts to built into how we learned to use the words and what our experience tells us those words typically mean This should alert us that we need to employ critical thinking When considering the language our competitors use it can and does cause them to approach the situation from a different perspective Which leads them to consider using different tools than we might choose That's just If you don't think through that right there you're just gonna fall short if you don't think about how your competitor or what more important What is your what is your subordinate how what words are they choosing Yeah, the Now that when you said all the earlier podcast the whole reason that I was so fired up for this podcast is because it's not just about competing It's more it's equally about leadership But my note on the cover of this says uh competing and then or influencing Which is leadership this This also applies to groups of people where a kind of collective orientation can work in a similar way We must constantly study the components of a rivals orientation if our understanding of their approach to competition is to be useful useful in crafting our own campaign Keep in mind that two people can look at a set of facts and come to very different conclusions about what these facts mean This applies to groups of people as well as we learn in chapter two narratives narratives stories narratives are what People use to give meaning to facts isn't that an interesting way of saying it a narrative in this sense is the story that explains how the world works This narrative or stories constructed from the components language culture experience found in orientation thus People make sense of the world based on their orientation and again the the podcast that that darele and I did on this Called I thought what's the what's a tormenting like Before panic like not anxiety like a little you know Nagging something yes, you see it full up one it fills up Satisfied like your gas tank you know when the gas tank goes all the way to empty and you're like I don't know that's like Let's do See what they're doing Like oh go run that thing through the line go operate that piece of equipment for a half an hour go check out that job site see what's going on So many good ways to change your perspective improve your perspective see more Next section combined arms combined arms is the full integration of arms in such a way that To counteract one the enemy must be more vulnerable to another we pose the enemy Not just with a problem, but with the dilemma a no win situation This is the way Marines fight and win battles This idea also governs how Marines compete even though we broaden no win situations to include careful consideration of positive some options Win win options the governing idea is to orchestrate all of our tools together in ways that are most favorable to us A combined arms mindset leads wanted to consider how to use multi domain tools for to of all potential partners in an effort to reach one calls The ideas to use all available resources to best advantage internal the Marine Corps We look to combine complementary characteristics of different types of units create a competitive advantage externally we look to combine our capabilities with those of joint force to create advantage We apply the same mindset in competition when we combine our capabilities with those of our joint and interagency Partners what what is the Marine Corps saying here? But if we want to talk tenants I guess we can break it down that orient Orienting on the enemy or On the competitor sorry, I'm going straight to war I'm all the way there on the continuum we need to develop an understanding of our rival if we are to create an effective plan that will help us prevail in competition We must understand their system Where it is strong and where it is weak this allows us to shape the environment by developing a clear vision For our competitive activities this vision also allows us to identify the partners with whom we need to coordinate Marines fight using combined arms and we must compete in the same way This is the foundational mindset for determining How we can present a dilemma to our competitor Marines in a Marine Corps are essential tools and our nation's effort to advance our vital national interest The Marine Corps makes its greatest contributions near the threshold of violence On the competition continuum this Marine this means that individual Marines Need to prepare themselves to act on both sides of that threshold and to do so in disciplined ways that advance the nation's interests Here's the closing paragraph for Podcast deep Computing is a way of thinking Like maneuver warfare it is a state of mind born of boldness boldness intellect Initiative and opportunism It's very interesting they you do they really start chiming in on this word opportunism They really start chiming in on that word So we're all looking for the same end, but the point you just made of the power of that I'm probably not gonna go to a rival company that doesn't gonna want to give me their people but inside different divisions that have kind of Competing interest inside your own organization and getting one guy from marketing to go spend six months on the operation side or one Getting you know a couple guys thing operations I spend some time with sales where they see it and truly understand what's going on the power of that inside your organization So you don't just buy off on the narrative of listen you join the Marine core You're not gonna get a lot of feedback that Marine core isn't doing everything right until you get out of the Marine core Go If you can understand from their perspective why they're doing what they're doing and of course that helps with your competition If you know why that chess player is moving the pieces the way it is that's a huge advantage But think about how you can help your people and This is just the idea that this understanding of their perspective the leadership Power that you have to understand that And the impact you can have to help them make good decisions or help them get to what they want to get or accomplish with they want to accomplish By understanding their perspective and you use example all the time we talk about kids and and That's actually one thing we can do is I remember what it's like to be the my 12 year old daughter and the thing For people like Marines who carry 100 pound rucksacks up and down a hill who hump machine guns who come over the beach Who dig in to foxholes to use the word work To describe How we're gonna think about things that's a that's an important thing to know this is not easy It's not easy And I'm gonna give everyone a little hint here myself included You know how you know you know how you can do intellectual work Okay, I guess maybe maybe half the time maybe half the time once we start a talk at about leadership and influence and That that that that definitely adds to it, but yes, so we have been talking about it from a leadership perspective and an influence perspective So like competing can be even at the end of the continuum or the spectrum or whatever where it's like war It's like you're influencing them to submit essentially Yes, I can beat you into doing what I want you to do Right with which we don't want no we don't we don't even want across the threshold of violence and so There is that when you know the way broadly you see it and all things I'm watching and seeing and this thing hearing you talking just making the leadership piece to that but from beginning to end that connection is as Absolutely there and it doesn't take some big change and perspective to see it inside here and to learn from it totally and You know the fact that the Marine Corps look they could choose a bunch of different things to dive into and the fact that they dove into this To run their organization and help their organization be prepared and grow That that's just an indication of the importance of this mindset of this way of thinking of how to compete How our rivals compete and how we Can't compete in a better way and With that you see that softball just get tossed up echo Charles with that speaking of trying to compete better and do better echo Charles They have they've both those rights in quotes This produces a frame of mind that seeks to make the quote right this choice in a given situation with quote right being defined by those back background factors This is all also often labeled intuition When somebody makes an intuitive choice while within their own culture the choices often judged as correct by others from that culture This is because the criteria they used to determine if correct aligns with the beliefs values and norms that originally informed the intuitive choice However people from a different culture have different judging criteria Originating from different values beliefs and norms which leads them to intuitive choices likely quite different from ours It will be difficult for people to explain why they made these choices because the criteria they used are below conscious thoughts That's why When you are building a team That's why culture is the purest form of decentralized command because Because they're making decisions without even without even thinking about it and they're making the right decisions if the culture is there They can make a decision without even thinking about it without even thinking about it. Although culture has a wide variety of attributes we will highlight time risk and mindset as we Consider how culture might affect the way our rivals approach competition Collectivists or group focus cultures emphasize the importance of the group over the individual and often feel compelled to reach decisions By gaining consensus which frequently takes time to develop from an American orientation This may appear to take too long from a collective Culture orientation achieving consensus might be considered so important that taking months or even years to reach a decision Is given higher priority Neither perspective is objectively right or wrong But each is logically consistent when viewed from its respective cultural orientation I have a note here my note says both these are wrong from a leadership perspective Let let them come up with the plan let them come up the idea and provide support to it So instead of like because you know when you say extreme long time I'm gonna take the blame that blame kind of indicates that like Ooh, you should get in trouble kind of a thing which can kind of trigger some people I think it makes people scared. I'm gonna go and predict this is the final day of Marine Corps Dr. Publication of one tack for competing and this first chapter is how rivals approach competition Starts off a friend of mine says that to try to describe what life is like in Russia to someone who has never been there is like trying to describe the mysteries of love to a person who has never experienced it That's from George cannon and then there's another Quote here complete competing effectively requires knowing your competition intimately how many hundreds of times have we heard that one Only by understanding a competitor's world view Decision making and behavioral Proclivities can one out maneuver that competitor only by grasping arrivals weaknesses and fears can one exploit them Such understanding in turn requires sustained intellectual and economic investment that's from how brands he's a historian Son of H W brands famous historian. It's decision making it's understanding trying to show some things that you need to understand Because Sunsu just said no your enemy Boom done, we're done Here's some details First section is called the test This chapter explores how political actors who view themselves as rivals to the United States and its allies approach competition Usually this means states with an authoritarian government or non-state actors who are described to an extremist ideology In Leadership strategy and tactics There's one section where it's on page 157 and 158 where I talk about what a Good leader in a new new leader stepping into leadership role and it actually ends up just applying to all leaders But one of the things I say in there is be balanced extreme opinions and actions are usually bad and what's interesting about this America The way America is supposed to be Is balanced that's the way it's supposed to be and you'll notice that when when they're talking about who the rivals of America are it's talking about a authoritarian government That's an extreme or non-state actors that are Subscribe to an extreme ideology
