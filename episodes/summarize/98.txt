it's shallow for a variety of reasons first it's not that easy to foster creativity because it's rare and self esteem is a very badly defined concept and mostly it's been used for harm not good what your job is as a parent is to help your child learn from between two years old and say four years old how to act in the world so that when people encounter them people smile and are happy they're around because then you know I've seen kids who behave badly and everywhere they go people where false smiles and everywhere they go people are relieved when they leave and that means you think about that world from the child's perspective everyone's lying and everyone hates them that's their world and then if you have your child you know capable of adhering to minimal social requirements like maybe being able to sit at the table in a civilized manner for an hour and being grateful for being fed let's say and knowing how to share and knowing how to pay attention to adults and not having that you know that kind of terrible cynicism and arrogance that can develop even in a four-year-old child who's always had its way then then they'll interact with adults in a manner that bring out the best in the adults and everywhere they go everyone smiles at them and pats them on the head maybe even tells them useful and interesting things and so the whole world opens up for them and that's all a consequence of you having enough courage to admit to yourself that your child can do things that you don't like and that you will take it out on them if you don't straighten it out and people don't like that idea because they think well I'd never do anything you know I love my child I'd never do anything to hurt them it's like I mean I work with businesses all the time and there is they they anybody that is just above normal competency in anything even that's going to try anyone that's going to put effort in they they love those people and those people are going to do well and you're absolutely right that doors are absolutely going to open for them if they do what they're trying to do to the best of their ability and do a competent job at it well the other thing that's interesting is what happens to people who aren't trying because what happens to them is like they're in a place where there's a thousand doors in front of them that are invisible they don't know the doors are there and they could either be opened or closed and so if they're one of these people who is going above and beyond the Call of Duty unless the organization is entirely corrupt right and that happens sometimes then there are people who are watching and they'll start to open these invisible doors and then all of a sudden the person has opportunities in front of them and they don't even know why some of the time right because someone said you know give a positive word to someone else and said you all you could take a look at this kid and so these doors open and then the people who are in there grudgingly and bitterly it's like people watch that and you got to be willing to die at the same time you got to be able to tamper and tamper all those things in such a way that they can be controlled and disciplined well I also think that that's part of what makes a world peaceful in the final analysis because if you're around people who are dangerous but disciplined then everyone watches their step and that's exactly what should happen everybody should watch their step and if you if there's no reason for that then well there's no there's no sanction for for poor behavior for example like I mean if you if you're going to discipline a child the child has to be convinced that your force that's worthy of paying attention to you know I see kids there's a chapter in my book called don't ever don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and I'm pretty happy about this chapter all the way suspect it'll be rather controversial and you know it's predicated first on the observation that many people hurt their children physically and psychologically you know because everyone gets sentimental about the relationship between parents and children but that's especially in relationship to themselves because they think well you know of course I'm going to be a good parent it's like it's not so bloody obvious that you're going to be a good parent you know and but you don't get to why and about it if you don't because you haven't tested it so people don't even have to look for some grand goal in the sky some elevated goal of what they're going to do whether it's a financial goal whether it's a a a a non-profit goal and they're going to they could look around their bedroom and figure out what they're going to do right now well to improve things one of the things I learned from reading social nets and this he talked about his moral transformation in the camps and he said the first thing that transformed him to some degree was looking at people in the camps who did refuse to do immoral things no matter what he said he ran into people like that and that just blew him away because you already laid that out it's like these are he said they were continually choosing between their life and their conscience and they chose their conscience like and and he tells some amazing stories in the Google I like our capital about dozens of people he meant like that met like that and they're just there's stories that of heroism moral heroism under absolutely vicious conditions there he just can't believe them you know but it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't change the fundamental question it's like if your life isn't everything you think it should be you have to ask yourself if you're doing everything you can because you actually don't get to make a judgment about the structure of being until you do everything you can and I would say that's love essentially that's the decision and then truth is the best the best strategy with regards to that attainment and how how could it be otherwise like if you're gonna contend with reality you bloody well better know what it is you know and truth isn't your grandmothers you know your your your your two tight-laced grandmothers moral finger wagging it's like the truth of existence is brutal and bitter and so to be able to face that and and to admit to the things that you are and to and to communicate them with other people especially in an intimate relationship it's like that's that's no cowardly morality that's not the morality of cowardice quite the contrary you know Nietzsche said you could assess the spirit of a man by determining how much truth he could tolerate it's like that's that's the right that's the right way of thinking about truth and I thought well you know you think that what you're doing is signaling your virtue by making a statement like that but from my perspective all you're doing is stating your cowardice and your historical ignorance because if you're going to be minister of foreign affairs you bloody well better have imagination for that kind of evil because if you don't then anyone who does wins they beat you and so you you know again in the Harry Potter stories you see he's touched by evil right he he actually has a soul fragment that's embedded within him that's as black as anything and possibly be that's why he could talk to snakes but without that he wouldn't be able to have any victory and that's exactly right psychologically unless you can think the way that an evil person thinks then you're defenseless against them because they'll go places you can't imagine and then they win and so the best man I've met that was interesting even when I was in junior high in high school because most of my friends dropped out you know by the time they're grade 10 they're about and a lot of them were guys who developed physically they're pretty powerful and they're just damn sick and put up their hand to go to the bathroom and it's like you know they're not doing that anymore one of my friends got kicked out when he sort of challenged the gym teacher you know physically and the gym teacher he could do an iron cross he was a tough guy and so it was no trivial matter for my friend to stand up to him but he got expelled anyways but because they're afraid to do the bad things and then when they see people do the bad things they're actually really deeply attracted by that because it speaks to part of them that could go beyond the rules and that's actually a necessary part it's a really necessary part like you don't make men safe by making them weak in fact there are much more dangerous when they're weak because they'll stab you in the back when they get the chance or take advantage of you when you when they get the chance you make men safe let's say by making them strong and then by making sure that they're disciplined and so you know you've got people like you have got this let's say warrior mentality that's a part deep part of their temperament and then you have some choices about what you might do with that you might try to discipline it and bring it under voluntary control and integrate it into your character in which it then it can make you someone who's stalwart and indomitable and who will move forward you know in the face of tremendous risk and well that's the optimal that's the optimal pathway if you have that kind of temperament and I think like it's the men that have the most what would you call it it's not aggressive exactly but we'll we'll leave it at that aggressive and fearless temperaments that can be the best man but it's like having a very powerful dog you better civil you better discipline because otherwise it's going to be a monster and you'll find that you've done a lot of what you said you would and so then it'll need to be reformulated so and and that's also very self affirming I suppose is the right it helps you understand that there's more to you than you think which is actually the case you know there is more to people than they think that that's one thing that's interesting about human beings and so you can put yourself you can you can stand up to things you're afraid of you know and measure doses and you find that you grow to be larger than the thing that you're afraid of and you know that's like that's like one of the basic rules of clinical therapies like if people are afraid of something you break it down into pieces and you have them encounter the things they're afraid of and it's also important that's interesting because that's I can tell you that that's sort of the middle of the bell curve and even like towards the higher end of the bell curve of military performers are you know people that are can concentrate on the task they're going to be relatively obedient but when you get to either end either high end either the low end of bad performers but also the high end or the people that know and to break the rules that are slightly rebellious that will rebel that will tell you know one of the big ones you know I don't want to be surrounded by people that are telling me that I'm right all the time I don't want my subordinates I don't have people that are working for me that are going to when I say go charge that machine gun as they say That happens to people all the time and then what happens is the thing that they didn't oppose grows a little bit and they shrink a little bit and that starts a loop, hey and so and you say, well, how do you take responsibility for the world and answer is, well, you also have to do it with a certain degree of humility because what do you know, you know, and this is part of the reason that I'm so opposed to the activist culture on college campuses, you don't teach 18-year-olds to go and demonstrate about capitalism, you know, because they don't know anything and they have problems in their own life that need to be solved that are local and the local problems aren't trivial, you know, they're not disciplined, they're, they're not looking at the world in a straight way, they're not taking responsibility for themselves or for their actions, their sexual actions among others, they're not taking responsibility for their family, they're not looking at how they could contribute to the community, they don't understand the fact that they don't know anything so okay you get it that's fine you know what you're supposed to do guess what we all know we're supposed to do we all know what's going to improve our station in life and what's going to make it worse why aren't you doing the things that you're supposed to do question I don't know now you got to make it actually do you want to know why could you lack the discipline you lack the discipline to do the things you know you're supposed to do don't well that also means that see what I like about that story too is that you established an individual relationship with your daughter you know because kids have different temperaments so like some kids if you take them to the playground it's like they're like pop you put them down on the ground they're like puppies over water they're feet will be going before they hit the ground and they're just gone right they're out there playing with the kids those are extraverted kids who don't have very high levels of negative emotion and your problem is going to be that they'll run off too far you know and I realized that no one had ever sat them down not even once in their entire career in education it said okay who do you want to be like what sort of person is it that you want to be not not job it's like character what do you want your life to be like what should it be like and what shouldn't it be like and like right about that seriously like your life depends on it because it does and that's that's the purpose I would say of religious training and philosophical training it's like just what the hell are you doing in the world you know when I would say well that's actually fairly easy to also to also lay out and this is why nihilism is a much weaker philosophical position than it might appear to be it's like well there are lots of terrible things happening in the world if you're not I don't care if you're a believer in atheist or cynic of the highest sort you listen to a story like the one that you read at the beginning of the of this podcast and no one says well in a hundred thousand years who the hell cares so why does it matter no one says that they listen to that not if they're human they listen to that story and they think that's not good it's like that's right that's not good it's not good you should do something about that because it's it's it's it's it's it's self evidently not good that's where I expressed my creativity not through not through pushing the envelope of uniform standards which is which is what a lot of immature young military guys do right right well and the thing about the people who will stand up and tell you what they think is that they tend to be disagreeable types as well and you know you hear a lot about emotional intelligence in the business world these days but emotional intelligence is really indistinguishable from trait agreeableness and so agreeable people are polite and compassionate and that's great especially if you're taking care of people but you want some disagreeable people around because they'll tell you what they think and they're blunt well isn't emotional intelligence though can you be agreeable but not be able to re-I always think of it as me being able to read people like I understand Well, it's interesting and again, this is kind of where when I would hear you say things like that, so as you know, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership, the opening chapter of the book is a horrible situation with a fracturicide happens on the battlefield so friendly forces, killing friendly forces, some of those forces being mine and you know, it's all these people I could blame and all these little incidents that happened that I could visit well, you know, we had this radio cryptographic change that happened in the middle of operation and it had people weren't able to talk to each other and we had these Iraqis that we didn't speak English, we had these units that we hadn't worked with before and they did things that we didn't expect and there's plenty of blame to go around and and essentially I said, hey, you know, whose fault this is, this is my fault on the commander. and then you go home and half an hour later maybe the child is doing some interesting little bit of work maybe art work or something or does something good and comes up for a reward it's like the probability that you're going to reward that child properly under those circumstances zero you're going to take the opportunity to take your revenge and if you don't know that then you're not much of the parent and so part of the trick with kids is that if your child is doing something that makes you dislike them that you have to figure out how to stop them from doing that and teach them how to do it properly you have to talk to your wife to make sure that you're not being too much of a monster you know on the same with her but that that discipline is partly what enables you to continue to like your child well you love them and even more than that you know parents talk about fostering self esteem and fostering creativity and all of that in their kids and I think that's miss begotten I think it wasn't Connecticut whether it was a bunch of elementary school kids shot right because this is kind of a one-upmanship game and it's bad enough to shoot high school kids but it's even worse to shoot kindergarten and elementary kids because they're even clearly more innocent it's like well that's that's part of that vengeful spirit you know better to punish the innocent than the guilty if you're trying to make a statement about your your hatred for the structure of reality and these things you have to understand these things really you have to understand the matter religious level of analysis because there's no well that's what happens when you encounter evil is that you're into the domain that can only be described by religious ideation and I don't say that lightly you know I've had many veterans come to talk to me now and there are people who had post-traumatic stress disorder and they've said that listening to my lectures has helped them out a lot because it's provided them with a philosophy of good and evil and if you have post-traumatic stress disorder you need a sophisticated philosophy of good and evil because otherwise you don't have any place to put your experiences and that fragments and shatters you it's but you don't put the evil outside like some of its outside obviously but that's not your initial concern your initial concern is to get your act together right to take on the burden of being to bear the suffering like you said you found that when you went out into combat that you know you might have been wary of death which is perfectly reasonable but that you weren't afraid of it to the point where it would paralyze you well that's a useful thing to know you know because it means that you're different than you thought you were you know because people are afraid of suffering in death and especially if they've been completely and constantly sheltered from it Well I mean that that's a very good question I mean I would say it's temperamental you know people differ tremendously in their temperaments and to think that there's a warrior temperament is a perfectly reasonable thing to think I mean there's been whole cultures many many cultures who were devoted to fostering that warrior mentality you know where if you weren't like that you were the outlier I would say that's probably true of most human cultures across most of time you know we've been fortunate enough to live in relatively peaceful times at least the vast majority of us so the necessity for that like right at the edges of actual warfare is much less than it might be under other historical circumstances so how do how do guys going back to the the PTSD conversation a little bit how do guys that sort of experienced this evil part of not only of the world but of themselves because they had to do some things that they didn't want to or they didn't like doing and things that made them feel like um there's a dark part of me that I don't really like too much what's the what's the you know from what I've said is you got embraced that the fact that there's darkness in the world and that there's darkness in you you got to embrace that and get a hold of it not trying to disguise it not trying make it seem like it's not there that's the same thing you're saying and they don't think well could I be one of those ISIS guys it's like I can tell you if you're bitter enough especially if you hate women you know because they've rejected you because you're such a you so goddamn useless that no woman in the right mind would look at you twice you know that'll generate plenty of bitterness in your soul and if you don't think that you could act like that under those conditions then you're not even watching your own fantasies so truth in the service of the betterment of being it's something like that and that's that's enough to give your life meaning I don't care where you start like I had this kid come and visit me a well back so well here's some things you have to do but here's some things that if you do you could reward yourself with and if you get the balance there between obligation and reward right then you'll find that you're motivated to do the things and and that's what you want to do you want to do that so it's sustainable across days and weeks and months and so you've got to you've got to treat yourself like a good boss would treat a valued employee and not like a tyrant would treat a slave because the slave will rebel and you know people say well I I don't follow through on my plans it's like well a they're probably not very well formulated you have this kind of tone about you though when you talk to kids that it's like it's almost like live that much over theatrical you know just that much so you can tell he's like playing a character on the right right and the kids love it it's so funny my daughter like loves him and the kids are just scrambling around wanting to do it again and like let me do this let me do your daughters or maybe you maybe if it's something you enjoy then you schedule it in there if you enjoy going pick in your kids up from school on Tuesdays and Thursdays because that's when they do the running club then you schedule that in there so you can go and do that thing that you want to do so you don't just schedule the things that suck you schedule the good things too and discipline equals freedom I say this all the time if you want to have more free time which is what people want then you need to have more discipline time management you will end up with more free time I promise you I promise you you will the other thing I was thinking about and I couldn't I just kind of occurred to me now is people always tell people you know come up with a goal and then write it down
