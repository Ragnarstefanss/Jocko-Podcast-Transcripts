[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 32 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.
[00:00:08] Find a new mission. That right there is some advice that I have given a bunch of guys, a bunch
[00:00:15] of veterans over the last decade because when you leave the military, that mission that you
[00:00:23] been on this honorable mission, all of a sudden overnight, it's gone and that's going to leave
[00:00:34] a hole. And the longer you serve, the bigger that hole is going to be. And for some of us,
[00:00:46] if the only thing you ever really want to do was serve and execute that mission, it can be
[00:00:53] a rough transition, especially after you spend 20 plus years with the opportunity to do what you
[00:01:03] always want to do to wear the cloth of the nation to take the fight to the enemy. And it's an
[00:01:10] honor to have had the opportunity to do that to work with a bunch of other people that are also
[00:01:18] dedicated to one thing in life. And that is executing the mission. So once that's gone,
[00:01:30] like I said, it can be a rough transition and you have to find a new mission. And some veterans
[00:01:36] going to business, some of them focus on their family, some of them start nonprofits,
[00:01:42] those are the positive things you can do, some serving other ways. And some just seem to keep going
[00:01:54] and keep getting after it and keep moving forward with new missions. And we're lucky enough to have
[00:02:01] people like that in our country. And I know one in particular that served in special forces
[00:02:10] Green Brey, fought in Afghanistan, Iraq served as a contractor supporting the State Department
[00:02:18] and supporting the CIA. It spent almost nine years all told in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria
[00:02:28] and in a bunch of places all over the world as well. But that wasn't enough.
[00:02:35] Needed more missions. This guy is also a businessman. CrossFit Jim, a giant CrossFit Jim,
[00:02:44] has a firearms range and a tactical training company. And he's competed in CrossFit and weight
[00:02:52] lifting an iron man and ultra running and he's coached athletes from CrossFit and strong man and
[00:02:57] triathlon. And it's up of all that in December of 2021, just a few months ago,
[00:03:07] he volunteered once again with a new mission to represent the people of North Carolina by running
[00:03:15] as an elected member of Congress. This man's name is Tony Cowden and it's an honor to have him here
[00:03:26] with us tonight to share some of his experiences and the lessons that he's learned along the way,
[00:03:32] Tony. Thanks for coming by. Thanks for having me. What's up with that bio? Take it easy, man.
[00:03:39] You know, people always say, like, hey man, I know you're busy. You know, yeah, I'm busy.
[00:03:45] I'm always busy. I don't take naps. I'm busy. You know, I got stuff to do and when I don't have
[00:03:52] things to do, I find things to do. You know, they all think like if you didn't get anything to do,
[00:03:57] clean something, I'm probably not that good at that if you ever see me my guns. It's not what I'm
[00:04:02] known for. But yeah, man, one thing after another and you hit it on that intro, how many,
[00:04:10] how many of our brothers and arms got out and that whole consumed them. They didn't find
[00:04:17] purpose. Everybody wants to know why is suicide so bad? Most veterans and across the United States
[00:04:24] in general, purpose. People with purpose don't commit suicide. You know, and when guys get out of the
[00:04:32] military, like you said, especially after filling using and abused in the 20s some years war now,
[00:04:39] where even the war itself, guys started questioning the purpose. What was the purpose? And at this
[00:04:45] point, we certainly don't know. But yeah, man, without purpose, you know, guys start drinking.
[00:04:53] It's a depressing. It's a poison. You know, they don't stop training because, you know, like me,
[00:04:59] I've always liked to train by myself. You know, I've only had one training partner in my entire life.
[00:05:04] It's my girlfriend Melissa. You know, she's the only dude I know that can keep up. No, I'm kidding.
[00:05:09] I should try to keep up with her. But I was just that guy that went into the gym by myself.
[00:05:14] It was my time. I went to run by myself and went rock by myself. I swam by myself.
[00:05:19] I thought that's safe for anything but whatever. But you know, those guys on the teams that
[00:05:24] go to the gym with their buddies, you know, they got their little click, little two and three
[00:05:28] man, team that goes to the gym. You know, when those guys come out, the surface they stop working out.
[00:05:33] You know, they lose their physical fitness. They drink. Maybe they got hurt and the VA put them on
[00:05:39] opioid, you know, the storing, you know, and they don't have purpose. And it breaks my heart.
[00:05:47] So many Americans, not just veterans, right? Because, you know, throughout the gym and everything,
[00:05:52] that grew so many civilian friends or whatever. And I don't use that term, you know, negatively.
[00:05:58] And anyway, I'm some of the best friends or regular people. Some of the best friends or
[00:06:03] regular people. Right? And a lot of times, you know, the deal, we would use that terminology
[00:06:10] like when on the teams and stuff like regular people. Like it was kind of looked out of my
[00:06:15] core of eye, not down at them. But you know, we recognize that, you know, we get this little team
[00:06:20] and we really think we're the most awesome ever, you know, like they'll joke. You know, you want to
[00:06:24] know who the best is in special forces or special operations, ask any unit. They'll tell you.
[00:06:29] All right, ask a seal. Seals are the best. I ask a danger. They're the best. You know,
[00:06:34] all with very different missions. But yeah, man, Americans in general, especially after
[00:06:39] this whole pandemic, figuring out the wild, no people are losing that purpose and we're losing
[00:06:45] that pride in our nation and, you know, now with all the containment and the mass and the mandates
[00:06:51] and stuff, and it's suicide mental health is, I mean, it's scary. You know, that's of despair.
[00:06:57] It's been a nightmare. Um, yes. Let's get into all that in a little bit,
[00:07:01] but let's start off just to get to know you a little bit. Let's start at the beginning.
[00:07:07] A little white trash red net kid from very rural North Carolina. You know, and I, that's
[00:07:14] definitely in terms of impairment. My, my dad, 80 second airborne guy. Oh, yeah, I'm already
[00:07:21] one a weekend leave from Fayetteville for brag in Wellington at my mom. Is that you're
[00:07:26] a festival weekend and that's a big thing in Wellington. That's a festival. And apparently he
[00:07:32] head over Hills and love with my mom, right? And, you know, freaking, they got married,
[00:07:37] got other, I mean, moved back to where he was from up in Indiana. She was from
[00:07:41] Palico County, North Carolina. We always use, we have to use the county as a marker,
[00:07:47] because there's no town in Palico County that anyone would even have heard of unless you
[00:07:52] actually lived or visited there often, right? So near towns like Newburn,
[00:07:56] so it's very rural. One of the biggest counties in North Carolina smallest populations.
[00:08:00] So anyway, they went up to Indiana and are you born yet at this point? Not yet.
[00:08:04] Oh, no, yeah. My older sister is about to be on her way. And he took a job with one of the
[00:08:11] companies who made parts for general motors, right? All that area up there, Indianapolis,
[00:08:15] Detroit, everything. They didn't solve general motors for so many so far. And after three or four
[00:08:21] years of being up there, he did a couple of things. He got like his pilot's license and
[00:08:26] um, which apparently, that then you didn't actually have to have. There were dudes flying
[00:08:32] airplane. They were flying airplane. They were flying airplanes while drinking liquor and stuff.
[00:08:36] The stories that they used to tell us, right? There were small news that flying these little
[00:08:39] supercubs and peppercubs around and you know, he was talking about shooting, you know,
[00:08:44] doing aerial, you know, shooting foxes and stuff. I'm like, these crazy suckers were doing
[00:08:49] aerial sniper shit with freaking hunting rifles and shotguns. You know, he's like, yeah,
[00:08:54] you know, there's little supercubs of fly so slow that you could shoot, you know, coyotes and
[00:08:58] foxes and deal with a shotgun. And I'm like, all about drinking, he's like, you know, it's like,
[00:09:03] you guys really not. So I joke that you know, when we're all out, you know, thinking we're cool,
[00:09:09] shooting out of a helicopter, bunch of redneck days, but you know, for a long time. But yeah,
[00:09:15] so you know, man, some affirmative action policies, my dad got pushed over for some promotions
[00:09:23] over those years and like he should have been a supervisory role. He was like, you know,
[00:09:27] people are getting promoted that have less time or less qualification. Got, got disgruntled with the whole
[00:09:33] manufacturing world. I would call it corporate per se manufacturing, you know, and it's like,
[00:09:39] I, well, they moved back down to Carolina where my mother was from. And he took a job with a seafood
[00:09:44] company. It's right on the Pamela co-sound. So dox, food and seafood will come off the boats there.
[00:09:51] They package process it, send it to restaurants. A few years later, he bought that company.
[00:09:56] So at this point, my older sister's born, I was born in this little timeframe there. And,
[00:10:03] you know, by like, so I was born in 76, so by 82, the business is doing good, you know, so
[00:10:09] and I'm old enough to be aware of it. And, you know, I've got to older sister in a younger sister.
[00:10:14] So when my dad needed help, guess who the laborer was, you know. So, you know, but I'll tell you
[00:10:23] my dad, you know, my dad wasn't like, you know, by today's parenting standards, my dad was a horrible
[00:10:27] father. Right? Like, he wasn't that nice to me. He wasn't the love EW, you know, hugs and kisses type.
[00:10:36] But he wasn't abusive either, right? Like, you know, I'd get a spanking if I deserved it. And I,
[00:10:40] looking back, I probably deserved everyone plus a few I didn't get. But, you know, he was, he wasn't
[00:10:46] a very good teacher. Right? He was the type of guy, like, by today's standards, like, he was just,
[00:10:51] he did it all wrong. But, you know, my older sister's a well-renowned pediatric and a chronologist.
[00:10:59] Right? Like, if you Google her name, you know, pretty amazing woman. Out of one of the most
[00:11:05] role underfunded school systems in America. My younger sister's successful social worker in
[00:11:13] Raleigh, she helps a lot of people with just amazing things. Of the three of us, she's the most
[00:11:18] left. I don't know that she would even vote for me. My older sister, she's in the moderate,
[00:11:25] my older sister's that, you know, that mother and America that was in the middle and kind of got
[00:11:32] pushed into the left over the last, you know, four or five years. But she's, she's that person
[00:11:38] I talk about. We need to win them back. You know, she's conservatives, she was raised conservative,
[00:11:42] she grew up shooting, hunting, and everything I did. But anyway, my dad was at God. It was like,
[00:11:49] hey, look, you need to do this and you need to do this and you better have this done before I get home.
[00:11:54] I feel like God, I don't know how to do that stuff, figure it out. And at the time, I thought he was just
[00:12:00] an asshole. You know, I just thought he wasn't, didn't like me. I don't know, and that's me to me,
[00:12:05] blah, blah, whatever. Actually, I probably wasn't even aware. It's just how it was. Because most of
[00:12:10] the fathers in my neighborhood were very similar. And I grew up in one of the neighborhoods like if you
[00:12:14] were caught misbehaving down the street, you might get a spanking from the neighbor. Right? Like they
[00:12:20] were all family. Well, it's church together, you know, and then you get another one when we
[00:12:26] would dad go home. But you know, looking back, and he taught me so much, he taught me to figure it out.
[00:12:31] And kind of find out that was the whole point. He didn't care if I completed it, you know,
[00:12:37] at a hundred percent, you know, awesomeness or whatever, you know, he just wanted me to try.
[00:12:42] And it's not like these days, man, and someone gives you a task like, I'll just YouTube it.
[00:12:46] You know, it's right here in here. I'll just watch a video step by step. It'll be easy, you know?
[00:12:52] And we didn't have that growing up, right? So, if you just had an extension cord and the
[00:12:58] wicked skill saw, you know, the fact that I still have all my fingers and toes, because he let me
[00:13:04] handle tools that, right? So my employees slash in terms at the range with the company.
[00:13:11] And I, they have like training programs that have to go through. They can't just pick up one of my
[00:13:16] chain solves, right? You chop your leg off with a chain saw like that circular saws, right? Like,
[00:13:21] that was like, yeah, man, just get it done welding. I learned it well because if I broke something,
[00:13:28] I better have it fixed before you got home. It looked like a big pile of tube bubble gum,
[00:13:32] but, you know, as long as it would hold the go home. Yeah. So that was kind of my childhood,
[00:13:38] man. And it was so many lessons learned. I watched my dad build this business from nothing to,
[00:13:44] you know, took us to a comfortable, I wouldn't say upper middle class, but, you know,
[00:13:49] slightly above average middle class, you know, especially for rural North Carolina,
[00:13:53] class of living is not huge. And he, at Balsam property, developed a piece of property
[00:14:01] into a subdivision on the water down there, one of the, one of the really first subdivisions
[00:14:07] in that era in Pamico County when there was a lot of resistance for change, right? People don't
[00:14:12] woo, we don't want to be Yankees coming down here, buying up our, you know, riverfront property,
[00:14:17] right? And so he got a lot of pushback. And I remember that was my probably my first exposure,
[00:14:23] you know, he would come home from a county commission and meet and, and these are all people we know,
[00:14:28] right? There's 12,500 people in Pamico County and has been for like 80 years, right? Like,
[00:14:33] the population doesn't change because it's actually a amount of people that move there or are
[00:14:37] born there, die or leave. Yeah. So yeah, man, um, it was really cool. That's when I learned to
[00:14:45] run like large machinery. At 12, 13 years old, my dad had me running a D6 bulldozer. Like what?
[00:14:53] We were putting the culverts in for the road, right? We built the roads in this place. You're laying
[00:14:57] layers and layers of gravel. So we bought a D3, a D6, excavator, a back of all this stuff.
[00:15:04] I can't even reach the pedals on these pieces of equipment. I'm out there running them.
[00:15:08] Without a lot of instruction, you know, or any instruction just go. Yeah. And I'll never forget,
[00:15:14] you know, putting a big concrete tiles into the, you know, the ditches for the road.
[00:15:20] I'm on the back house, steering these things in and he's in that ditch.
[00:15:24] They're talking thousand pound concrete tiles. If I make a mistake, I would have killed him.
[00:15:28] Oh yeah. Looking back, I would have never trusted me. I wouldn't have gotten that ditch, but he did.
[00:15:34] And I was like, wow, you know, either A and my dad was a complete cycle. Right? Um, which, you know,
[00:15:40] he's one of those guys like mission men, we will get it done. Being in the rain in the military,
[00:15:46] not a big deal. Because my dad was like, it would, there was that local little restaurant in town where
[00:15:51] everybody ate breakfast all the men, you know. And it'd be raining. And I'm like, all right, we got to go.
[00:15:56] And I'm like, oh, working in the rain today is like, I don't get to choose the weather.
[00:16:00] Now, it's his attitude, man. He was just a tough motho, and just hard hours upon hours of work,
[00:16:07] you know. And I like to say I'm a decent balance between him and my mother who was, you know,
[00:16:13] the more gentle, I mean, she was, she wanted to, a post by any means, right? Like, she didn't
[00:16:19] put up with none of my BS. I, she, I probably got more spankings from her and I ever did him, right?
[00:16:23] You know, but like, you know, little pops on the, on the ass or whatever. You got more quality from the old man,
[00:16:29] but why are you from that? You know? And some people would say that, I was, I was my mom was baby boy, right?
[00:16:35] I was the only boy. I mean, that was different. You know, my older sister, man, she's like,
[00:16:40] she's like a T-1000. She's the first version of the Terminator, dude. She is like,
[00:16:45] when people meet her, they're like, whoa, dude, I thought you were in terms. No, my older sister's a
[00:16:50] machine. I said it was probably like five or six people in this planet. I'm, I'm afraid of,
[00:16:56] she's one of them. You know what I mean? Like, there's a handful of guys. We're all, you know,
[00:17:02] pretty tough dudes, right? You know, you can hold our own and all that kind of stuff. But there's
[00:17:06] all of us have that handful of guys that you're like, you know, like, I was kind of scary.
[00:17:10] One of those guys from these my older sister. And I'm not kidding, right? Like, uh, she's just,
[00:17:16] oh, man, she is what she is in a successful because of it. But yeah, man, you know,
[00:17:22] watching my dad build those businesses, develop that piece of property, really set that foundation.
[00:17:28] And, you know, since I was involved in so much of it, because he didn't have labor. You know,
[00:17:33] he didn't have help. So I had to be there. You know, I didn't get to play sports in school,
[00:17:37] like I wanted to because he needed help. And looking back in a lot of ways, those lessons just
[00:17:42] continued to carry over whether, you know, like, heck, when we were in the Afghanistan or right before
[00:17:48] we were going in the Afghanistan, we were at the F.O.B. You need equipment moved around. Yeah,
[00:17:52] I knew how to run Fortlifts. How do you think we moved Palace around in that seafood house?
[00:17:57] Fortlifts, you know, even that big crazy machine that grabs the connexes, I went and jacked one of those
[00:18:02] from the Air Force one time. We just went and moving around the entire lot, you know, they entire
[00:18:06] all the connexes, you know. It was like, hey, go get that and bring it over here next to our tent.
[00:18:11] So we can pack out, get ready to infill. Well, I could do all that when we got in the Afghanistan,
[00:18:16] you know, I knew how the little local tractor that the fellow had, you know, we needed it to
[00:18:22] move some stuff around with tunnels like, yeah, you know, I can run that. So that foundation was
[00:18:26] huge. But more than any of the actual stuff that I did at the moment, what he taught me was that I can
[00:18:31] do anything. If you put your mind into it, it's just like selection. I don't remember selection being
[00:18:37] that difficult, you know, it was just like I had this mission and it just had to be done. I mean,
[00:18:42] I had, you know, he couldn't really afford all three of us going to college, you know.
[00:18:49] He was struggling a little bit. My mother died when I was 16. I was after that. I went
[00:18:56] I went to misbehaving. How did your mother die? Cancer. Yeah, four year about with it, man.
[00:19:02] And ultimately it wasn't really the cancer to kill, or it was a surgery.
[00:19:06] Complications from a surgery. So it's kind of heartbreaking. Like,
[00:19:10] yes, she had been fighting at or whatever. Really, you know, the struggle back then was chemo,
[00:19:15] which it still is. But, you know, you're talking in the early 90s, man, for a chemo, we're rough.
[00:19:19] And so I learned a lot from watching her deal with it, man. She, she would get up and walk and
[00:19:25] exercise and working to yard and mo the yard, you know, while having to stop and throw up from chemo.
[00:19:31] Yeah, so one of the toughest people I ever grew up with was my mother. And yeah, so after she passed
[00:19:39] man, you know, I started being that bad kid, you know, and smoking weed, wound up doing a little
[00:19:45] blow, whatever, freaking gotten trouble, you know. Where'd you get trouble with like school?
[00:19:52] Yeah, you're schooled the law. Yeah, I got arrested, man, for you can,
[00:19:56] and luckily, you know, it was all just minor dumb stuff, right? It was not like I was a, you know,
[00:20:02] dealing anything or stuff like that. I wasn't, you know, making money off of it, just party and,
[00:20:08] you know, just doing dumb redneck stuff, you know, like hunting club roads, you know,
[00:20:13] you don't want to get on a road, you get a DWI, but we can ride around these hunting club,
[00:20:16] dirt roads, redneck stuff, you know, drink beer and, you know, and, you know, do all the dumb stuff
[00:20:23] we were doing. And that was when you're still in high school? Yeah. So yeah, I'm not seeing
[00:20:27] you in high school, you know, just being bad. And, but I was still making good enough grades.
[00:20:34] Excuse me. Yeah, I was, you know, just, you know, the deal, man, just how, like everyone
[00:20:40] in software, all pretty smart news, we can get bees without really trying. And any course we go to,
[00:20:45] you know, most of us are bees students and every course, and of course, there's always that one
[00:20:50] nerd over there to get to honor that. You know, and whatever, like fun of that guy, what a nerd.
[00:20:56] Yeah, I wasn't the nerd. I was a misbehaved kid just being a jackass for me.
[00:21:01] And you didn't play any sports because you were working too hard. Well, I did play a little bit,
[00:21:05] but like, with Drew from, you know, the team and senior year, stuff like that, just,
[00:21:10] just because, yeah, man, he needed help after working. And, um, we still do after high school. Yeah,
[00:21:16] man, so, you know, also our, man, we were the smallest school system and right next door to us
[00:21:23] is like West Craven. You know, that's a school that's producing, you know, pro football players,
[00:21:28] you know, DH Conley, over in Greenville, ECU, you know, big schools, man. And we were like,
[00:21:34] they're like, we'll let Pamela go play us and they would just destroy us. You know, they had like
[00:21:40] defense and offense and in special teams. We had a football team. You didn't leave the field, man.
[00:21:46] And then it was times we went to football games, we didn't have enough dudes, you know,
[00:21:48] we were a whole play. And, you know, so after, you know, a couple years of that, man, I wasn't
[00:21:52] really interested, you know, it's like, what's the point? I mean, you know, the average student
[00:21:57] on our team, you know, we had that one 220 pound guy where you got a West Craven there and tire
[00:22:01] lineups 200 plus pounds. We would just, they would mock the floor with us. So I lost this,
[00:22:07] just to not just started working more and partying more. And yeah, man. So good enough grades to get
[00:22:12] into NC State, I look at how I'm like, I still don't know how they let me in. You know, not good enough
[00:22:19] grades to get any kind of scholarship. So, you know, after the second year, my younger sister's only
[00:22:25] year behind me, my older sister is four years ahead of me. She's entering medical school. Where
[00:22:31] she'd go to school? She went to medical school at ECU. Where'd she go to undergrad at UNC
[00:22:36] Chapel Hill? Yeah. So, you know, Dad's paying out of pocket plus he's still very much, you know,
[00:22:45] dealing with the death of my mom. And he had a really hard time, man. For he can, you know,
[00:22:50] I watched him lose a lot of weight, you know, he'd and talked to people, he kept working,
[00:22:54] you know, and he worked more, which was already done there in possible. And you know, being a young
[00:22:59] dumb punk kid, I couldn't recognize it because I'm selfish, like kids are. And I'm looking back
[00:23:05] I was like, man, I could have been a better kid, I could have been a better son to him. But I mean,
[00:23:10] we were kids, we were young and I hadn't looking back, man. I'm mom talking to the number one
[00:23:15] best lesson in my entire life. And that is everyone you know is going to die. Right? So, as we
[00:23:23] entered that war, I had already lost and I tried to use that terminology. One of the people
[00:23:29] was closest to me in my life. And so that set me up for being able to deal with how many of our
[00:23:38] brothers got killed close friends and so on and so forth. You know, our partner forces, you know,
[00:23:44] I don't think guys always realize how tight we get with those partner forces, you know, I got
[00:23:50] some of my best friends on this planet are, you know, Muslims. People don't always understand that,
[00:23:56] you know, especially in Iraq where I worked with the Kurds for years, the same tune of dudes
[00:24:01] for seven, eight years. And so anyway, her passing taught me to appreciate why you have them.
[00:24:10] And that's why I don't use that terminology, you'll lost them. I didn't lose my mother. I can go
[00:24:16] show you right now where she rests. I know exactly where she's at. So I didn't lose them.
[00:24:21] It was a gain. Right. If someone in your life is so tight with you that when they die, it breaks
[00:24:27] your heart. Right? You didn't lose anything. You gained something in life. Because if, if when we
[00:24:35] understand that everyone we know in love, they're going to die. When you start thinking like that,
[00:24:40] you start appreciating them every day. You know? So I can say, my mom told me the best lesson
[00:24:48] that I've ever had. And it set me up or success in the war. And don't get me wrong. It doesn't
[00:24:53] mean like I'm somehow callous or, you know, immune to filling sad and upset. You know, there's
[00:25:00] still those antivarsaries. There's thoughts, you know, those memories that pop back up,
[00:25:04] to make us all upset, you know, and tear up and, you know, and so on and so forth. But
[00:25:09] and then freaking without her death, I don't know that now today, I would be as healthy mentally as I am.
[00:25:16] You know, it just laid that foundation. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and I tell people at all
[00:25:22] a time and I have throughout, you know, once I realized that and I'll tell you, it really probably
[00:25:28] number one thing that really woke me up 2013 and April 2013. My best friend was getting,
[00:25:35] I had gotten in Ben Bittner. Ben was better than everyone else. He was that cocky little little
[00:25:41] girl. That guy, you know, who everything could make it up to you. He was just better than
[00:25:46] everybody else. He wasn't huge or jack, but he was strong and fast and so anyway, man, I got that
[00:25:54] phone call. I mean, Melissa hadn't been dating very long. We were driving up 540. It was kind of early
[00:25:59] on a Sunday morning. I got a phone call. So I hit this, you know, hey, bro, Ben Bittner. Okay.
[00:26:04] Dude, put off the side of row and threw up because of one dude I thought that was truly
[00:26:09] immoral, right? Just got suckered by the enemy and abated ambush, right? And if had not been,
[00:26:18] it was, I mean, that's 13, man. We're 12 years into the war. I mean, already got plenty of memorial
[00:26:23] braces, you know, but for something about when Ben died, it was like holy crap, we're not immortal.
[00:26:29] You know, I'd been injured, blown up, you know, how it is. As a young little trooper, sometimes,
[00:26:35] right, those close calls, they make you more arrogant and cocky, right? You know, you start thinking
[00:26:42] that you can get away with more and more and that's probably where I was in 13. When I got
[00:26:47] blown up in 2009, like after my recovery, I went back, meaner, more aggressive. You know,
[00:26:55] probably taking risks that I shouldn't have, you know, looking back, taking risks with my teams
[00:27:00] and my partner forces lives just because I was emotionally wanting some retribution, you know,
[00:27:07] they killed some of my teammates and damn near killed me and then Ben died. I was like holy shit.
[00:27:14] But like I said, without my mom's death, I don't know that I would have dealt with any of it very well.
[00:27:20] So yeah, man, in C state, I like to say that I was enrolled at in C state.
[00:27:25] So your participation level is low. Well, there's panic of county and there's like, you know,
[00:27:34] my graduating class is like 104 people. So let's say there was, you know, 55, 60 girls in that
[00:27:39] class, right? And then I get the NC state. There's girls everywhere. They were everywhere. I was like,
[00:27:46] holy crap, man. There's like thousands of them. And yeah, so I was distracted to say the least. And,
[00:27:56] you know, I quickly found out that classrooms where you have to be quiet and pay attention to a
[00:28:00] professor and not the best place to talk to these girls. So why would I waste my time going to those classes?
[00:28:06] And so anyway, for you can impartian, waste and money, you know, that that we didn't have.
[00:28:12] My sisters in med school, now my younger sisters, going to school, she went,
[00:28:17] it was going down at, you know, at C Wilmington. And, you know, it was clear, you know, that I was wasting
[00:28:23] money. I didn't have it. I didn't have it. So I withdrew. I joined the army. You know,
[00:28:30] was that your first time thinking about joining the army? Absolutely not. I didn't want to go to college.
[00:28:35] Right. And, you know, our generation, we have to blame our parents for everything. So my dad let me
[00:28:40] watch Rambo first blood when I was nine or ten years old. Done to be high. That was green braised.
[00:28:45] They were real badasses. You know, says it right now, movie. And, you know, so from there,
[00:28:50] when you're like, let's face it, right? Like, some guys watch, you know, something has got seals in it.
[00:28:55] And they're like, oh, yeah, or some guys will watch, you know, the recom movie with Clint Eastwood.
[00:28:59] And, you know, and you're impressed, and at a young point, when mine was Rambo first blood. And,
[00:29:03] freaking out, you know, running around above the snow line. Rats in the caves. I was like, yeah, I was already
[00:29:10] playing in the woods all the time. Anyway, I loved it. I know I had just man. So from there on out, yeah,
[00:29:14] I just went on this funny green hats, which is looking back. I'm like, damn that hat's up.
[00:29:20] It's made out of wool. It's hard. It's hell, right? Like, you want me to wear this wool hat in Fayetteville?
[00:29:25] You know, I mean, you're almost the reason to summertime the sand hills on the little Carolina.
[00:29:29] All right, like, this hat's dumb. There's no bill it then keep the sun out of your face. There's
[00:29:33] not like a boonie cat. There's no ballistic protection. Why are we even wearing this dumb hat?
[00:29:38] All right? Like, anyway, um, but yeah, that's what I wanted. And I didn't help. I met a fellow
[00:29:45] named Jason McKenzie at NC State and he was going green to gold. And he started telling me,
[00:29:52] I was here for my green. Yeah, he was a GB at the time. And he was getting his commission.
[00:29:58] And he went on to get his commission. Go back to the 18th of course, and then when I went over to the
[00:30:02] unit, freaking stud, he was a stud. Real smart dude. Still it. And um, and I was like, started talking to him.
[00:30:09] He was like, hey, look, Brown, I get it. College socks. Let me tell you about this really cool secret.
[00:30:16] It's a card that's called the National Guard Special Forces Groups. And I was like, what?
[00:30:22] How is that even possible? How can you have a reserve special operations? We'll come to find out.
[00:30:26] Most all of those have that. And uh, it is the coolest, most least known way to get in the special forces.
[00:30:34] And I'm like, what do you mean? You know, I wear the lights. I know. And he's like, yeah, man.
[00:30:38] So, basically, you go in and it's just like an active duty group. I mean, they just, you know,
[00:30:43] less bullshit. And that's really what it almost comes down to. It's like, the guard gets on orders.
[00:30:48] It's not like they're doing, you know, one week in a month, two weeks a year type of thing. You know,
[00:30:51] they're doing weeks of training at a time. If when they deploy, it's, you know, months of work up,
[00:30:57] PMT, just like the group. I have to check all the same boxes just in a lot less time.
[00:31:03] And I'm like, okay, yeah, he's like, how's it work? He's like, well, you know, he's got me all hooked
[00:31:07] up with 19th group. The guy's up in West Virginia. I had to get a waiver for my misbehaviors and a rest,
[00:31:14] right? And I remember, uh, what year is this? So this is uh, 97.
[00:31:18] And it was a hard-gitten waivers? It was it. Were you a minor when you got arrested?
[00:31:24] No, uh, yes, and uh, both. Okay. I had just turned 18. Um, um,
[00:31:32] one of the arrests. I was still senior in high school. And uh, but everything else was before that.
[00:31:39] And uh, now I'm in freaking, so I go and talk to these guys and Colonel Hoyer was the
[00:31:46] batonic commander for the second baton of 19th special forces group. And he moved on to become like the
[00:31:51] the general, the tag of West Virginia, really smart man, really smart guy. And um, not a very imposing
[00:31:59] figure, um, you know, just an average-looking guy, guy that could throw a suit on and disappear, you know,
[00:32:06] uh, not the jack tattoo guys. Of course, tattoos on the sleeves and all that weren't quite
[00:32:11] populated time. And I remember walking in and thinking, this is a special forces Colonel. I was expecting
[00:32:17] you're like John the Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Colonel, Captain, from Rainbow, right? He's supposed
[00:32:22] to scare the shit out of me. Very on a suit, in which come to find out later. Yeah, those are the
[00:32:26] dudes that are really the scary guys. Anyway, when he was like, um, yeah, so you need a waiver.
[00:32:34] You're gonna do this anymore? I'm like, no, sir. Done with that. I was, you know, three years ago,
[00:32:39] um, good. Okay. Boom. That easy, you know. And and had he, in his assessment, for whatever reason,
[00:32:49] you know, um, because I know him to have turned down some of our cases. But man, it was that was
[00:32:54] no interview. Nothing. He just took me on a very first impression basis. And I was just a dumb kid.
[00:33:00] I didn't know. I'm like scared to death. All these GBs, you know. I'm like, you know, I'm trying to
[00:33:04] join this very exclusive club. And I don't know what to say. I don't know how to act. So nothing,
[00:33:10] I would have done it. I would have been right anyway. But yeah, you gave me the waivers. I was
[00:33:15] drew from school on a Tuesday morning. I, you know, Riley to Pamela Kirkandley to the house,
[00:33:20] is about two hours. I went home. I died once at home. I was okay. Changing to some PT's and went
[00:33:24] for a run. Sure enough, many on the road. He like hits the braces like, what the fuck? Are you doing?
[00:33:30] Why are you home? You're supposed to be in college, boy. What's wrong with you? And you're
[00:33:35] he knew at this point like, oh, something's up. Right? Like this ain't right. You know,
[00:33:39] a great, he's probably in trouble again. That was probably his first impression. I'm like,
[00:33:44] I'll run to the house. That'll meet in there. He probably would have pulled over to the side of the
[00:33:49] road and got out. And we would have had that discussion on side of the road. But my stepmother,
[00:33:54] he luckily, I'd be Lord man, luckily for my dad. He met an amazing woman after my mom died.
[00:33:59] And who became one of my very best friends. Sad story. She died a cancer too. My dad, man,
[00:34:06] God blesses all of it. So my stepmother's with him. And I remember she kind of like patented
[00:34:10] him on the shoulder and was like, let him come home and talk to us. You know, come at that
[00:34:15] wasn't a little dude either. Right? Like he's, you know, about my size. Now, right? I was always
[00:34:20] small in him until I finally started lifting some weights. I was actually way more of a runner-dead
[00:34:24] early on. I was like, about 70. You know, I could run. I had no real weight on me, you know, but he was
[00:34:31] like two, two, ten. You know, he's a strong dude, a worker guy. Yeah, he boxed about
[00:34:37] only 18th every one for the few times we did, scuff it up a little bit. Yeah, he just made
[00:34:42] one for me up. Right. I just covered up. But you know, like I said, anyway, man, freaking uh, yeah.
[00:34:50] So I go to the house and I tell him he's just shaking his head, but it's like he understood. You
[00:34:55] know, he understood. He knew, I mean, of course I'm in something new me. I'm his, he joined the
[00:35:01] 80 second hour board of the same reason I wanted to go. So yeah, man, um, a few weeks later I was
[00:35:07] in base of training back quick, huh? Yeah, yeah. It was like two and a half months from the time I
[00:35:12] signed up, I was already in base of training because back then, you know, late 90s recruitment was
[00:35:17] out of pre-low there, the administration and they'd routed the military and cut so much funding.
[00:35:22] But trying to get guys to sign up for combat arms, you know, the recruiter would be like,
[00:35:27] hey, yeah, signing my right up. Come on in here, you know. So yeah, did that? Um,
[00:35:32] that was boot camp. I was in such a good shape that it was like easy. I think I got
[00:35:37] more shape when I got. I was already getting like a 340 on the Army's PT test. Right. And a lot
[00:35:43] of it was, you know, I could max the push up and sit ups, but my runtime was like, I was
[00:35:46] around like 11 flat two miles and I'm just a little runny. Right. And, uh, and skinny, God bless
[00:35:53] one, how I look back at some of the impakers been like, wow, wow, boy, you need to eat.
[00:35:58] Did you, you never ran like competitively? No, in high school or anything? No, no, I didn't
[00:36:04] start running. I joined the ROT scene at NC State because, you know, okay, maybe I want to join
[00:36:09] them. I mean, but, you know, maybe I'll be an officer. Yeah, you know, that didn't really play out that way.
[00:36:14] But that was the first time I started doing PT and running. And I think like my first PT test
[00:36:19] had must have run like a 15 minute 2 mile, but like my second one was sub 12. Yeah, so apparently
[00:36:24] had some decent pre-disposition genetic pre-disposition the running. And the shock of boot camp was
[00:36:32] no factor because you were just stoked to be there. Right. Yeah. And, you know, at this point now,
[00:36:37] I'm 20. So I'm one of the oldest kids in basic training. And I'm even back then, I'm looking
[00:36:42] around doing, looking like these are a bunch of posts. Where are these kids come from? Right? Like
[00:36:47] clearly they didn't work like, you know, my dad, you know, in my head, I think every American boy's
[00:36:52] like me, you know, and others he's city kids and whatever man, yeah, but, but, but basically it wasn't
[00:36:58] hard. I mean, I got like, you know, top PT and you know, it was a quickly made like the stupid
[00:37:03] platoon sergeant or whatever and I was like, you know, and you know, there was a little click,
[00:37:09] you know, because I did the basic and AIT back to bags. It was like 14 weeks. So you same drill sergeant
[00:37:14] all the way through by the end. Me and these couple other boys are a little bit older, a little bit
[00:37:18] more mature, you know, we were running things. We had our own little mafia going, you know, we had
[00:37:24] when they let us clean the drill sergeant's office, we took the key, snuck off post, made a coughing,
[00:37:32] a copy of it. So now I had a drill sergeant's office key, which had all our personal bags and the
[00:37:38] right, like, so we would go in there and listen to the walkman and CDs, you know, and like,
[00:37:43] hide out and it was funny because the drill sergeant had no idea we were doing it, much less
[00:37:48] that we were leaving post. I don't know, you can't leave post in basic training, there's no
[00:37:52] self like nowadays they can make phone calls and be on the internet, none of that, you're a lockdown, right?
[00:37:58] We were sticking off post and like, because we had access to the civilian clothes.
[00:38:02] I was thinking I'll post going in by and beer and it's stashin it. In the drill sergeant's office,
[00:38:07] in the personal right, we going there at night and how is a few beers, you know, buy some liquor,
[00:38:14] no clue. So I always say like, I was already running an underground in auxiliary when I was in
[00:38:19] basic training, like, that was just, you know, where I was just. I mean, I got out of there and
[00:38:25] um, freaking immediately went to the little progression course or whatever PLDC where you had to go
[00:38:34] from, you know, to get your promotion to E4 or whatever. And it was like a couple of days before I finished
[00:38:41] that little three week course. So you already E4 after like a few months? I know, I'm still in E3.
[00:38:47] Finished because I did have a little bit of college. I was finished basic as an E3.
[00:38:51] And so now I'm in a little PLDC course. So I can't get promoted E4. And like, hey, you ready to go to
[00:38:58] selection? I'm like, I guess, huh, win. And like, in two weeks, maybe I haven't won a rock side.
[00:39:08] Right? And that's all our selection is. It's carrying a rock sack for 28 days.
[00:39:12] Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Because I'm like, I'm not going to say no. I'm not turning down a slot
[00:39:18] at SFAS. Looking back, I could have been like, hey, I really could stand another month of training.
[00:39:23] And it'd been like, okay, whatever, and put me in the next course. I didn't know it like that.
[00:39:27] I thought just an opportunity at selection must have been a God soon. You can't say no.
[00:39:32] So I had a whopping two weeks to train for selection.
[00:39:37] It went straight there, you know. And even then I look back and I'm like,
[00:39:40] wasn't really that hard. But it wasn't hard because quitting wasn't an option.
[00:39:44] Right. I couldn't have withdrawn from college.
[00:39:46] All the good, special forces and then fail. Right. That wouldn't have been a thing. I could not have
[00:39:54] sold that to family members, my dad, right? Myself. How many people get, how many people make it through
[00:40:02] that first selection? What is it? 28 days you said? Back then, it was 28 days. Right. It's changed a lot
[00:40:08] over the years. I think right now it's 21 days of actual course. So maybe 26 days, counting the
[00:40:15] admin and all that. So it was 28 back then exactly four weeks.
[00:40:21] Yeah, there was 250 or so dudes in my class, 52 finished and 41 were selected.
[00:40:30] And I think a lot of folks don't know that, right? You can finish that course and I get picked up.
[00:40:34] 28 day non-select. Yeah, that's got a hurt. I just got hurt. And so yeah, I got picked up.
[00:40:42] And most of those people are quitters or their performance drops are medical drops. So they hurt their knees.
[00:40:49] Yeah, you know, the number one attrition rate is voluntary withdrawals. That's probably 95% and then
[00:40:56] injury. And it's funny how seen some dudes and sure the same at Buds and everywhere else. You see those
[00:41:01] guys that like, they've got stress fractures, broken ankle, broken toes, torn, patellar tendons,
[00:41:08] and they finish. You know, I was just young and stupid man. I'm so lucky.
[00:41:16] I don't get blisters on my feet and never had. I got some of my first blisters ever last year hunting
[00:41:23] in the mountains of Idaho because I bought a pair of boots and didn't really break them in. I
[00:41:28] worn around and North Carolina working around the house and then I thought backpack going and
[00:41:32] go hiking in the mountains of Idaho. And I call it hiking. It was armed hiking because we didn't
[00:41:38] kill any. It's not really hunting. It was just armed hiking. Really well armed hiking.
[00:41:47] Good training. I guess you could talk it up on this. But yeah, I'd never even gotten a blister like,
[00:41:51] you know. So I was lucky when it comes to that because that's a big thing in our selection.
[00:41:56] It's like, just dudes feet get turned to hamburger. What do you, how you know, a rough march if you
[00:42:02] didn't got feet? I was seeing some blisters that started the toes and then like the back of the heel.
[00:42:08] Really? Like things that like you could lose a leg at, oh, you know, in the medical like, whoa,
[00:42:13] you know, they have horrible, you know, in the little medics station and all those pictures.
[00:42:17] And you think it's just some genetic thing. You just don't get blisters. I just for whatever
[00:42:21] is my feet fit jungle boots, which is weird because it's not like they're, you know, I just did.
[00:42:27] So yeah, I mean, that just worked out finished selection. It was funny because at the time
[00:42:35] Regs said to finish it was before the 18 or the SF Baby program. The 18.
[00:42:41] Thanks for that. It was before that. But the guard had the back door. It was like the 18x
[00:42:47] because I didn't go to any other unit. And so it's graduation day. I had to go to the strength
[00:42:54] and to the board a couple times because I was in E3 and they were like, you can't.
[00:42:59] You're not even supposed to be here much less finished. Like what though?
[00:43:03] We didn't know what to do with me. Again, some dudes looked at it, gave me a waiver.
[00:43:09] But it was funny because, you know, the company commander, company commander and the training
[00:43:13] SF training is not really involved in anything. He shows up, you know, he's an admin guy.
[00:43:17] I've been a most part the elicid boys run selection. So come time, you know, he's
[00:43:23] handing out, you know, his graduation, not very formal. It's out at Camp McCall.
[00:43:26] You're just all dirty and nasty and you're walking across the swill stage and he's handed out.
[00:43:30] He's like, staff sergeant, such and such. Captain, such and such. You sergeant, such and such.
[00:43:34] You know, hey, shaking hands and I get up there and he goes, private for it.
[00:43:39] He looks at the first sergeant and the whole class knows. We don't wear rank instead of there,
[00:43:43] but you know, right after four weeks, everyone knows who the cherry loot tenant is.
[00:43:48] And you know, there was some guys that are probably who were pissed that I was there as an
[00:43:52] unit three. But most of the guys were like, wow, this dude's crushing it and he's a baby,
[00:43:57] but I wasn't a child, you know, what an 18. You know, at least I ever jagging there like 24 or something.
[00:44:03] Yeah, very much so, you know, the average a senior E4 promotables, E5s and E6s made up the bulk of
[00:44:10] the class. And most of the officers were, you know, first lieutenant in captains. And so
[00:44:17] it was kind of funny because the whole class like laughing and clapping. You know, because the
[00:44:22] captain or the company commander in major was like, what the? You know, he talks to the first sergeant
[00:44:30] in the sergeant major and they're like, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[00:44:33] It's like really? And I'm like standing there on this day's way. Am I getting ready to get booted?
[00:44:38] You know, as a commander, gonna go, nope, right here. And so anyway, for he can shake my hands,
[00:44:44] he goes, all right, private first class, Calden, welcome to Regimen.
[00:44:49] All right on. So man, it was kind of screwed up. I was in a racing motorcross.
[00:44:55] One week before I was supposed to report to the Q-course, broke my femur, a couple ribs, my arm.
[00:45:02] Yeah, man, at a race that I shouldn't have been racing, are you not allowed to race it?
[00:45:07] No, you wouldn't like that, you know, you know, that wasn't on the list of things you can't do.
[00:45:11] You know, like, you know, it was a skydiving, you know, one never thought.
[00:45:15] He's not going to enter out there. Like, don't go right road you.
[00:45:19] It's on the list of things that you're not supposed to do while, you know, in the Q-course,
[00:45:23] wasn't in the Q-course yet, but motorcross wasn't on the list.
[00:45:27] Until I broke my femur, they added motorcycles to the list because of me.
[00:45:32] So, I had man, I, I, I missed my Q-course day. And I was supposed to go to the Delta course.
[00:45:38] I wanted to be a medic. Oddly enough, my plan was to go be a medic and either go to PA school or medical school.
[00:45:46] I wanted to be like my Terminator sister. I was the one that, I probably want to be a doctor more than she did.
[00:45:52] And I was always in the, you know, I wanted to be like the, you know, the ER doc. I want to be the trauma guy.
[00:45:56] So, 18 Delta just made sense. Well, eight months later, I'm still limping, you know, they put a rod, my leg,
[00:46:03] and all that, you know, I got my run times back down pretty good, but man, it hurt. It just hurt.
[00:46:08] Because I just destroyed this leg, man. It was like, you know, so I drove afterwards, you know,
[00:46:13] I put my hands around my claw. It was just a bone in there and it was nasty. Basically what happened was I over-jumped a triple jump.
[00:46:22] The jump got walled up and kicked the bike forward. My buds were standing in a very,
[00:46:28] so they could see the drain plug on the bottom of the bike. The bike was pointing at the ground. I was still upright.
[00:46:34] When it hit the ground, the front tire basically trapped this leg and then
[00:46:40] catapulted me, just threw me up in the air. So when you said it's not a race, you should have been in this like two advanced
[00:46:44] of a race for another one. The exact opposite was like a local outlaw race, not an AMA Sanctuary.
[00:46:51] It was just a fun race, but there's no fun races because you still got a win.
[00:46:55] And I was battling first. And a funny thing was I was racing in the 250 class and the 125 class at that time.
[00:47:06] So I had already race those two and then there was this the unlimited class where
[00:47:10] it didn't matter, you can race anything you wanted in it. And so I was racing six motos that night,
[00:47:16] six different races that afternoon and night. It was the six motos exhausted. And at folks don't
[00:47:21] realize man, I'm in phenomenal shape at this time and motorcross is still one of the most
[00:47:27] physically demanding things I've ever done. And you know, because you just don't realize that you're
[00:47:32] strapped to a 230, 40 pound piece of equipment that has 45 horsepower. You know, with the right.
[00:47:42] You know, you're trying to control that thing. It's not like you're just relaxing on it. You're
[00:47:47] standing up. You're clenching it. You know, twinuleys all that. And anyway, yeah man. So now my career is like,
[00:47:56] okay, now what? So through it advisement, okay, look, you lost all this time. I'm going to sign
[00:48:02] you up for the Charlie course, the engineer demo course, and I'm like, all right, at this point,
[00:48:05] I just want to get in the course. And you know, I've been basically doing nothing for eight months
[00:48:09] that's ever rehab. And so, okay, cool. So did the Charlie course. It was kind of funny man in the
[00:48:16] Charlie course because I'm from North Carolina. So I know people at UNCW, which is a, you know,
[00:48:23] Wilmington is a college town with a beach problem, right? It's a state ECU party. I have friends
[00:48:31] everywhere. So I was like the tour guide on the weekend, right? Like, yeah, I know people at this school.
[00:48:35] Let's go to this party, all that kind of stuff. So we're having a good time. That's why I met that fellow
[00:48:39] Ben Bettner, our little click, and a bunch of little crazy dudes. And you know, borderline,
[00:48:47] you know, we were misbehaving in the QCourse, you know, because it wasn't at hard, you know,
[00:48:51] especially in the MLS phase, it wasn't the very hard. So we were party in and blah, blah.
[00:48:57] Yeah, I did all that stuff. Language school wasn't hard back then because no one cared about
[00:49:01] language. You really didn't have to go to language school. So I went to language school, but did
[00:49:05] not learn French. And then of course it didn't really matter because it was like eight years
[00:49:13] later before I ever went anywhere that spoke French. You know, not a lot of French speakers and I
[00:49:16] rack and Afghanistan, you know. But you have African cool stuff. I got lucky though because if I had
[00:49:25] done the medicore, I would have missed the invasion. I'd have been in language school or
[00:49:29] Sarah school during that time frame. So because I did the shorter Charlie Cours, I was already done
[00:49:34] and I wanted to team and doing some pretty cool stuff. I have to understand kicks off and I got
[00:49:40] to go to the beginning. Where were you when September 11th went down? So when I said what doing cool stuff?
[00:49:46] I wanted, he was the ASO guy, right? The source operations guy, not the door kicker guy. Even
[00:49:53] though he had done all that, he had just matured into understanding that that's the hard part, right?
[00:49:58] The finish is the easy part, right? How long does that take us to execute a target? You know,
[00:50:04] 30 to 90 seconds typically, right? We're on target. Everyone's up tied or done. We're done with the
[00:50:12] target. Now we're doing SSC. It's quick. It's that find fixed part, ASO stuff, right? It's actually
[00:50:20] difficult. It takes a brain. And he was all about that and because I was that skinny college kid,
[00:50:26] I didn't look like an SF guy. So he got me signed up on this program that 5th group, 10th
[00:50:34] group, all the active groups were participating. It was 10th group's year to run it. And it was the
[00:50:39] red cell against the end triple C, the new cook commanding control. So for the four months leading up to
[00:50:46] 9-11, I'm running around the nation, tracking and developing patterns of life of this
[00:50:55] general, it's got a suitcase attached to him. He's like number 12 in the chain of command
[00:51:02] of running our country in the time of the nuclear war with Russia. And I had no idea because it was
[00:51:07] very cellular, right? It was broken down in the little cells, which is ironic, right? Because now
[00:51:14] we're playing red against the United States, nuclear commanding control. For those six months,
[00:51:21] I didn't interact. I did not see face to face. It was all old school cold war tradecraft.
[00:51:26] Dead drives. No, no text messages. Nothing. And the only time I got text messages I was
[00:51:31] called is when I actually called the handler who was a chief out of 10th group and he was running
[00:51:38] our cell. So we were in Oklahoma, Nebraska, silos, right? And this guy would go from
[00:51:46] silo facility to silo facility with these tractor trailers that indiscripped. Three tractor
[00:51:52] trailers are so. And that could change, right? And then a security detail.
[00:51:58] That all playing clothes and stuff, right? Like you drive it on a highway, you would never notice
[00:52:02] this convoy. Of course, they didn't nut the buck convoy either. It was just these three tractor
[00:52:05] trailer trucks. And sometimes more than that, sometimes the convoy was much larger when they had
[00:52:11] other pieces of equipment that I had no idea what it was. I only cared about him.
[00:52:14] Because the ultimate goal was when we were supposed to execute, we were trying to create
[00:52:22] four second hiccup in the United States. In the United States, in the United States, reaction
[00:52:25] the rushes of time. War seconds. That was what it was. That's all supposedly rush and needed.
[00:52:33] War seconds, man. Well, come to find out man. It was a worldwide effort. I wouldn't just
[00:52:37] my four goofballs. And I knew there was some others because other teammates in my were
[00:52:40] scattered around the country. And I knew they were doing it. I had no idea where they're at.
[00:52:44] Because last time my song was a meeting in Northern Virginia where we all came together,
[00:52:48] they briefed us in a single one of the ways. And it was fun, man. I'm just a little punk-y little
[00:52:53] SF dude. Man, there were unlimited budget, freaking, just swiping a government credit card.
[00:52:58] There was days I had two different rental cars, freaking, you know, hotel. And it was an amazing
[00:53:04] thing. It was really cool because you know how to get interim T.S., which backed in a little baby E.6.
[00:53:10] I had a T.S. Clansus. So that paved the way to get my my Clansus set up and all that.
[00:53:17] Much younger than I should have probably. Or at least was standard at the time.
[00:53:24] So yeah man, on the morning of 9.11, I would crawl through this drainage little
[00:53:30] culvert. I went to Walmart, bought some leafy Gucci flies from Walmart. And I thought,
[00:53:35] if we can get a little crappy Walmart, Gillesuit, and I called for four hours to get within,
[00:53:41] taking a picture of this general. That was going to be the shot. And like I said, man, you
[00:53:47] got teams around the world, taking pictures of different types of planes and tell numbers. And
[00:53:52] oh, this plane took off and into a turkey and then it landed in Alaska, like, they flew across the
[00:53:58] North Pole. I mean, these are some crazy assets, right? Well, yeah man, so I get a text and it's
[00:54:08] like a board moved to such and such. And I'm like, I'm not compromised. I'm good. Right now,
[00:54:16] what's the text I got back? A board right now. And I'm watching his security detail change.
[00:54:23] Hmm. What's happening? And as I'm crawling out, man, freaking like the local sheriff's department,
[00:54:34] freaking starts pulling in. Do's have got shotguns, right? Local redneck do's,
[00:54:40] some Marines showed up. I guess they were like, freaking had been hovering this whole time
[00:54:46] as Marine detail that I was not even aware of. I'm likely they weren't aware of me either. So now
[00:54:51] I'm crawling quickly because it's clear something is going on, right? Because they've got
[00:54:56] mags in their guns. I'm like, what the fuck man? Get out, get my car, freaking call, hey, what's up?
[00:55:03] Yeah, meet me at this motel. It's like, you know, side of the road dirt motel, one story old school,
[00:55:08] you know, 1950s built motel. And there's like 40 rental cars in this motel parking lot. I'm like,
[00:55:15] what? Oh, it's going to come to find out it's not my four man cell. And they were reddubnet
[00:55:21] sees upon redundancies for all these cells, but every location around the world. And none of us knew
[00:55:26] about each other. And I coupled them and you like recognize them. These things have been going on for
[00:55:30] months. And I'm like, I saw you in Nebraska. I saw you males, females. And this is, that's a good point
[00:55:36] because that was the first time in life. I realized how important females are for reconnaissance
[00:55:43] surveillance, freaking like they, wow, they do have an amazing role. That changed a lot of my career,
[00:55:48] the way I saw women and how they can be an asset, right? Like me and you, right? How do we walk around?
[00:55:56] We're not building anywhere. We don't even blend in in average. US freaking, you know, city much less.
[00:56:03] Throw on some a man dress and try to walk around to a lot about that. Yeah, we're busted.
[00:56:08] Yeah. But man, these ladies, you know, they can go and do, especially when you recruit the ones
[00:56:13] that can speak Arabic and, you know, can blend in, right, which we learned that lesson. But this
[00:56:18] was my first time seeing females. I was like, holy crap. Come to find out, one of the people on
[00:56:23] my team was a female. I didn't know. I'm just dead drop in letters and knows. So anyway, as I walk
[00:56:29] into hotel and man, yeah, there's like 40 people in this little hotel. It's not, I mean, just cramped
[00:56:34] hands sitting and looking at a TV of burning towers. Yeah, man, I'm just sitting there going,
[00:56:41] okay, what the fuck? We're under attack. And at this point, you know, it's early in the morning.
[00:56:49] No one even knows. Pentegon hadn't been hit yet. And so that happened while we were sitting there.
[00:56:56] I was just like, whoa, okay. So we pack up. We actually went linked up with that asset
[00:57:04] and provided a ring of security for them and escorted. So we went from playing red cell against
[00:57:10] them to helping with their security cordon. We were unarmed. So we pulled an outer security and
[00:57:16] escorted them to a hard location. Yeah. And then got on planes and flew back to wherever we were
[00:57:22] supposed to. They were unique guys. They were guys from Damneck and bald. Everybody flew back as fast
[00:57:28] as they could. But planes were grounded. So they're sending C-17s from wherever they could and
[00:57:33] picking us up. We drove 100 miles away to Colorado Springs in a 10th group and got on flight
[00:57:38] wherever we could get them. It was always funny because, you know, like, the two one guys,
[00:57:43] you know, the the lear jets were waiting for them. We're just waiting on like whatever we could get.
[00:57:47] Like, oh, can I get on that crop? Do you get a ride back to brag? You know? But it was always
[00:57:52] remembered. That was my first impression of those guys. Like, how come they get lear jets?
[00:57:56] No, they're they're important. We're the scrubs. But yeah, man. So that's how it all got started.
[00:58:02] You know, I had a slot to go to MFF and, you know, National Guard, young SF2 to get a slot in
[00:58:11] free fall was a big deal back then. You know, because back then we didn't all SF2 and all go to
[00:58:15] free fall. And so that chief was like, well, I mean, your orders are good for another year.
[00:58:21] Your detailed and assigned to us. And what do you want to do? That's what I mean. Well, you can
[00:58:27] go to free fall or you can come with us in life. I'm with you. Let's go. A couple of weeks like
[00:58:34] your man. We're in Afghanistan. You know, young, dumb kid. What that look like? So they're like,
[00:58:40] what kind of what they do say? All right, here's what we're doing. Yeah, a lot of people
[00:58:46] figured out. Like, you had used to say to you, yeah, I mean, it was like, hey, you know, call
[00:58:51] your family members. We're going to an isolation Monday. We're doing what? What's that? What's
[00:58:58] isolation? Like, this is how, like, I only, I was fleshed out into about what that Robin says.
[00:59:01] I didn't completely understand, right? And honestly, most of the guys didn't either. It was like,
[00:59:06] no, just because I was new, none of the force had been to war either. There was still only a handful
[00:59:11] of guys in SF because only a handful of fifth group dudes got to play in the Gulf War.
[00:59:15] Yeah, handful of guys from Mogadishu, you know, no combat experience. Yeah, I was going to say,
[00:59:22] in your actual team, there might have been zero. The chief had stuff in South American 80s,
[00:59:29] you know, but all, you know, by with and through advisement stuff. But yeah, man, so I'm like,
[00:59:35] okay, well, here we go. And I'm in, I got to go and be in Torbora, you know, so there was basically
[00:59:43] a lot of, because it's funny for us, like we all know how it all played out. But I mean,
[00:59:47] there's an entire generation of Americans that were born either right at or after 911,
[00:59:53] who don't understand, right? There was two parts of Afghanistan that was the Taliban,
[00:59:57] right? The horse soldiers and everybody that came down from the north and
[01:00:01] background, you know, triple nickel, you know, all that team did all that. And then there was Torbora,
[01:00:06] pardon me. And, you know, okay, so I got lucky enough to be involved in all of that. My team settled
[01:00:14] in Jalalabad. Where'd you find, where, how'd you get in there? Yeah, he though. Yeah. So he
[01:00:20] loaded into Jalalabad and you guys get, um, we, he loaded in South of Jalalabad, North of Torbora.
[01:00:25] And then what was your, what'd you do? Um, I'll just support it. Mostly supported the J tax and
[01:00:30] CCTV guys dropping bombs. All right. And tried to mostly coordinate and keep our, you know,
[01:00:37] there was two main warlords in this region. And one was Hazard Ali. And the other was Saman.
[01:00:43] And Zaman spoke English. And then was the agency's pick to be that Nengahar warlord,
[01:00:50] that Nengahar leader. Was the man had lived in Britain for 10 or 12 years. He left Afghanistan.
[01:00:57] Hazard Ali was moves, man. He was, he was a farmer. Right. You know, a lot of folks
[01:01:04] don't realize, man. You know, Afghanistan of the 14 most opium producing countries in the world.
[01:01:10] Afghanistan was number 14 when we invaded. It's number one right now. That's a horrible result of
[01:01:18] this war. Well, Hazard Ali, who ultimately became the minister of defense, afghanistan, was a farmer.
[01:01:24] But also, a freedom fighter moves against the Taliban. The Taliban very much disallowed,
[01:01:30] opium growth. You know, they, they were all about, you know, that was a sin. So,
[01:01:37] you know, we changed that. I get into the Taliban.
[01:01:40] All right. Everybody started going opium. You know, and wow, what beautiful fields, those pink
[01:01:45] red flowers, man. They're beautiful. But, ooh, it's just death growing out of the ground.
[01:01:50] You know, so anyway, yeah, man. How long are you on the ground for? How much longer? This is where
[01:01:57] my first. This is that question is where my fairy tell of initial entry and
[01:02:02] special horses begins to end. So, fifth group wanted out as fast as they could. So,
[01:02:10] January, February, they're already like, yeah, we're going to the horn. When do you get their
[01:02:13] November? So, November, December, January and fifth group is already, the fifth group is like,
[01:02:19] they want out. They want to get to the horn of Africa, right? There's still no talk of Iraq at this point.
[01:02:24] Right? It's like, oh, horn of Africa. We're going to Somali and everybody wanted that.
[01:02:28] Oh, okay. We're going to get some and return that favor. Right? It's 10-year-old favor. We owe those
[01:02:33] Somali's. Everybody wanted to get there. Well, then the clear-of-battle plans changed and
[01:02:38] Iraq became a thing. Well, so 19th group and third group start showing up. So they're like,
[01:02:44] hey, look, we're just going to, you're going to be continuity. You're going to help this next team
[01:02:48] rip in. Right? So, I got left. I wanted to stay like another six months. And I was like, oh, no.
[01:02:57] So, that was where that ferry to. Everything happened. It really cool. Kind of went, oh shit.
[01:03:02] But it wasn't bad because I wound up being on a team with a bunch of dudes that were good friends.
[01:03:07] Mine actually got to go be an LNO for a few weeks up in Tashkint, Uzbekistan. So, as a, you know,
[01:03:15] 24, 25-year-old young little buck. My first experience in a former Soviet area. It was nice,
[01:03:22] nice four weeks apart. I was supposed to work at the embassy. I think I went to the embassy twice.
[01:03:27] I was the assistant LNO. The LNO was this former tech group dude who had retired, got called back in.
[01:03:35] And he had been working like the Miami-Dade organized crime task force. He was a, he,
[01:03:42] I'm not a says that. He had a very Ukrainian name. He was from the Ukrainian. He came to America when
[01:03:48] he was like 12. So, he spoke Russian, Ukrainian. Man, he had all kinds of stuff going on in Ukraine.
[01:03:53] Or not Ukrainian. Uzbekistan. And he was connected as the LNO out there. If you needed something
[01:03:59] out of Uzbekistan, he could get it. I mean, the second night I was up there, the dude took me to a party
[01:04:04] at the Ukrainian Uzbekistan. He's president's daughter's house, no, man. And this dude knew
[01:04:12] everybody. He was the quintessential SF guy. But he's like almost 60. He's kind of a way. He speaks
[01:04:19] Russian and he's fluent. So, like four days after I get up there, he's like, oh, yeah, I'm going to the
[01:04:27] states. So now I'm just up there, the assistant LNO. And I'm living in the Sheraton, which that's
[01:04:33] rushing for Sheraton Hotel. So, all I learned. And so, I just pored it for like four weeks.
[01:04:40] And, you know, basically my job was to take, you know, my bud, my Uzbekistan, my brother, my Uzbekistan,
[01:04:46] and go pick up people from the airport, take them to the hotel and then take them back to the airport.
[01:04:50] So, they could fly into the FOB. And, so, yeah, man, pretty cool. But, yeah, so back to Afghanistan,
[01:04:59] and then finally home. And, you know, did you do any good ops? Like, what kind of missions were you doing?
[01:05:04] Yeah, you did a lot of cool stuff. You know, of course, you know, dropping all the bombs in Torboro's
[01:05:09] school. Of course, we started. And there was still a lot of, you know, stuff out there, you know,
[01:05:15] we went after some, um, diagonal and chetions, you know, some of those, as they were, you know,
[01:05:22] because, you know, when you guys already working with a partner force, yeah, we started the
[01:05:27] initial, what became the command dose. It was called the MRF, the Merff Mobile Reaction Force,
[01:05:33] there in Jalalabon. Jalabon wasn't a base. It was just a crappy airfield. Every time we went
[01:05:37] and get a resupply, we had to clear the airfield. And, uh, clear the runway, make sure that
[01:05:41] and putting you thing on, you know, the MC130s would, you know, squeak in in the middle of the night,
[01:05:47] drop our junk off. And, um, so we started building what became Jalalabon's FOB. We built
[01:05:53] ranges out there and started training this, uh, Hossard Ali's guys. And, you know, I was
[01:05:59] sorry about Zaman and Hossard Ali. They, they're the reason freaking, uh, you be all got away.
[01:06:06] They were supposed to be helping us deal with Al Qaeda and they turned on each other, right? So
[01:06:12] Zaman, the CIA's pick, no one liked him. He had no real pull. He was nobody. He had most of these
[01:06:17] kids had never heard of him. And Ali, who's been there, you know, running a show,
[01:06:21] he's not having it. So, yeah, man, they started fighting with each other and you got, like,
[01:06:27] you know, half the teams over there with them and some of the other teams and then half of us
[01:06:31] over here with Zaman or, uh, Hossard Ali's guys and they're fighting each other. And we're like,
[01:06:36] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're supposed to be killing those dudes. So, it screwed the war up
[01:06:40] for about three days as we sorted that mess out. And, yeah, man, that's when that's when he escaped.
[01:06:46] That's when he got out. How do you guys sort that out? Ultimately, the agency stepped in,
[01:06:50] they were running the show there, right? The Julietteens. And we were basically supporting them.
[01:06:56] And we had two masters, right? We had the FOB in fifth groups, Colonel Mulholen. And then, of course,
[01:07:02] we had the ground branch guys. And they were running the show in Torbore. And so, we, uh,
[01:07:12] freaking sorted that mess out. And basically, they told Zaman, like, a stand-out. And once everything was
[01:07:18] hashed out, settled back, by went to Jawabod. Zaman actually went back to the to Britain. They
[01:07:26] exiled him. That's what Hossard Ali told everybody that he exiled him. But really, they just
[01:07:30] was like, hey, man, you just need to lead your own. So it was a bad call. And it was, you know,
[01:07:34] uh, one of those convenient things he spoke English, Hossard Ali did. And,
[01:07:40] bad call, when our part on who we decided, we thought we could put in power.
[01:07:44] Um, we didn't really understand how much influence Hossard Ali really had over the post to people.
[01:07:50] Well, at least they had the humility to recognize that and say, all right, cool. We screwed this up.
[01:07:55] Let's get this guy out of here and move forward. You know, it's interesting to
[01:08:00] history repeats itself, right? Like talking about the SF guys and Vietnam.
[01:08:04] I even have those, like guys shoot each other on base between the, the, the, the, the mongs and, uh,
[01:08:11] whatever other groups like the regular view. I mean, they'd get in fights, right? And shoot each other.
[01:08:15] Yeah. Yeah. Like, well, and then they go out and mission with these guys. That's one of our
[01:08:19] biggest problems, right? We for some reason as Americans, we have this arrogance that we think everyone's
[01:08:24] like us and likes the things we like. And, well, you know, we have this amazing experiment in America,
[01:08:31] this diversity that's never been this way. And he wear else on the planet ever. So we can walk out on the
[01:08:39] street, go to McDonald's and see 20 different ethnicities, freaking people from all around the world.
[01:08:46] Right? At least their ancestors are. And in some cases, they literally just came from that.
[01:08:50] Mm-hmm. Well, in other countries, those people will fight each other, right? They're like
[01:08:55] from different villages and different tribes. And they don't like each other and never going to.
[01:08:59] We think we can impose that. Right? Like, Americans can't grasp why the shit and the Sunni
[01:09:06] absolutely hate each other and we'll fight each other. And the only time they'll come together
[01:09:11] is to fight someone else to hate more. Us or Israel. Right? Yeah, you know, Americans,
[01:09:18] and we're bad about it. You know, we really think we can imply or impose our way of doing things.
[01:09:26] And you know, the deal, man, you know, you got your kind of or whoever else at the F.O.B.
[01:09:31] We're out there living with these boys. You know, living with them. There are our team.
[01:09:35] And we're trying to explain all the dynamics of it. And you got some可能 who's never done
[01:09:39] even like Fidz or J.S. at much less run an unconventional war with a partner force.
[01:09:44] I was frustrating, you know? Because it to me is just simple.
[01:09:48] You know, it's like, hey, just be nice to all these people. Sure you can stop treating them like crap
[01:09:52] and realize that that tribe and that tribe should not ever be put in the same unit and given
[01:09:59] loaded weapons, they will shoot each other. But, man, it's us, you know, it's just how we do
[01:10:05] things and like you said it. We just repeat it time and time again. Yeah, sometimes I think it's
[01:10:12] it's conceit or whatever arrogance that we think. Well, if we tell you guys to work together,
[01:10:17] we're going to work together. And sometimes I think it's just arrogance. It just don't realize like,
[01:10:20] hey, at least these two people that you're talking to right now, they're not going to get along
[01:10:25] ever, ever, ever. Nothing you can do. Yeah. Unless for some reason, like, ever,
[01:10:31] you say, ever as well. That's what the hell goes against that. But it's so good.
[01:10:35] The person's gone. You can be an ally for the next two days. How much money are you going to
[01:10:39] get out of this? You know, if it like, and you know, that's funny. I've always tried to tell folks,
[01:10:44] there's a huge difference between allies and friends. An allies are usually pretty predictable.
[01:10:49] Because that means we have a very common goal, a common enemy, a common, we have a common
[01:10:56] ality. Whereas friends, a lot of times friends, that's a loose relationship based mostly on emotion.
[01:11:02] Right? And you, you see it all the time. Who hurts our feelings the most? Our friends.
[01:11:08] Our allies are predictable. When you go into an alliance, so like business advice, I've always given
[01:11:13] guys business advice when a lesson is out of the list, don't start a business with a friend.
[01:11:17] If you have to have a partner and you shouldn't take a partner. But if you have to have a partner,
[01:11:22] get this endeavor started. Do not do it with a friend. I haven't listened to that advice. Like,
[01:11:27] all my businesses are with all my friends. I hope you had better luck than I have.
[01:11:32] That's a good, man. It's hard. You know, when you got, especially we tend to start businesses
[01:11:38] with guys like us. And we're also hard headed and setting our ways and all that, you know, and if
[01:11:44] there's not some type of clear hierarchy in those operations agreements and that stuff that
[01:11:49] you can always go back to and be like, hey buddy, this is what the company says.
[01:11:54] Well, in my case, we didn't even have like an operations agreement. We just started it and then,
[01:11:58] you know, luckily it didn't dissolve into where we hated each other and it's like that. But,
[01:12:04] my dad always told me that he was like, you know, you know, a partner don't have one.
[01:12:07] Yeah. And then sure enough, he was right. He was smart. Yeah, man. The crew was awesome.
[01:12:16] So how, so you end up going to, so you end up spending this first like, what is it?
[01:12:20] A year and a nine months and a half, and a little bit of time, and he's back.
[01:12:24] 7.5 months and then what happens? So we're home and you're in the national guard. Are you
[01:12:32] so you're in the national guard? Yeah, but I'm on active duty. Okay. So it's no different.
[01:12:36] No, so, you know, the guard guys would mow and demobes and there would be two months on the,
[01:12:42] you know, they let's say they deployed for eight months. And that was pretty typical.
[01:12:45] It was two months of mob and in two months of demobes for a total of a year,
[01:12:52] deployment. Got it. And so it was the deployment two months on the front end, two months on the back end.
[01:12:57] That became the standard for SF, national guard. Well, mine was kind of like, well, what do I do now?
[01:13:03] Who do I belong to when I'm working for? And so I was lucky. I freaking,
[01:13:11] did some, the counter drug mission for the national guard. It's advisement to law enforcement.
[01:13:18] So I did that until, right? Yeah. And it's providing surveillance training,
[01:13:26] you know, deal with it. It's kind of, what about possible?
[01:13:30] Sculpt well, you know, we're unarmed. Most of the time, you know, sometimes you know,
[01:13:35] we're really going to go out in the middle of West Virginia and reveal these methods with 30
[01:13:39] out six rifles. Probably going to carry my personal firearm and deal with the ramifications later.
[01:13:45] And I had a couple times where methods like, we were snow,
[01:13:50] we actually didn't think he was home. He must have been sleeping it off, you know, because
[01:13:54] methods would, you know, they'd be up for days and then they'll sleep for days. And we thought this
[01:13:58] math trailer, there was no, you know, they weren't cooking or whatever. And our sitting on the
[01:14:03] size mountain that snow, we're wearing woodland camouflage, we're eating, we're messing about,
[01:14:08] we didn't build a high-side, some come up. We're not taking this seriously. And we're like 250
[01:14:14] meters from this dude's, it's like a cabin and a trailer, open his holler in West Virginia.
[01:14:21] Dude, he comes out and starts scanning with his hunt right for an scope. Dang. And we're just sitting
[01:14:28] there trying to get behind your trees. We're sticking out like sore thums and we're not wearing
[01:14:33] overwides or anything, just dumb. Because like I said, we weren't taking it seriously. You know,
[01:14:38] we just been to Afghanistan. We're a bunch of tough guys. What's this dumb red neck? We're looking
[01:14:43] at Redneck didn't see us in shoot us, right? Cause let's face it, Redneck boys, you know, they
[01:14:47] can shoot. Wouldn't have been the first time he shot something without hunting rifle. You know,
[01:14:51] I was like, oh, good God. I was running a recon course one time. This is like before the war. And I had
[01:14:58] this group up in the mountains. And they're they're like laid up in a high-side, right? And I'm
[01:15:05] a land-grade, right? So I'm out there, but I'm camied up to cause I'm all fired up. So I would like
[01:15:10] sneak around and so I'm kind of sneaking up on them to kind of observe what they're doing to make
[01:15:16] sure that they're being square away. And as I'm sitting there observing them and I'm not that far away from
[01:15:22] them, like 50 meters away, a guy, I hear like a dog, right? And I'm like, oh, these catcher can
[01:15:27] get, you know, bus, dude, this is going to be cool. I'm going to watch the whole thing. So a guy
[01:15:32] comes out, he's got two-fork and German shepherds with them. And they look badass. They look like
[01:15:37] freaking wolves. And so the guys, you know, I'm watching this whole thing play out. And you know,
[01:15:42] the guys pick up that they're coming because they, it was a square-dwayered little crew. They,
[01:15:46] they pick up a guy coming, they go like fade in. They're, they're hunkered down.
[01:15:50] Guy comes walking down this path. It wasn't even a road. It was a path.
[01:15:54] And he doesn't, he's none the wiser. And all of the sun, the dogs, bro, the dogs are like,
[01:15:59] they stop, they start growling. And all of the sun, the guy like starts scanning.
[01:16:05] Yeah. He reaches down and pulls out a 45 bro. And I'm like 50 meters away. And I go,
[01:16:14] excuse me, so the guys, I just go, excuse me, sir, you know, because I'm, we're in America. Like,
[01:16:20] you said, I just know what the hell's going on, man. I'm like, excuse me, sir, sir, you know,
[01:16:24] sir, it's okay. I said, we're in the military. We're on training operation, but
[01:16:29] it was not a good scenario to have. Yeah, there was lots of things like that. You know, especially
[01:16:34] in the urban side, good friend of mine, they called him the SF Cowboy. They used his likeness in
[01:16:42] that video game and all that. I don't know if you remember some of the first pictures that came
[01:16:45] out of Afghanistan, big dude, sleeves cut off, people here. He was my roommate. We're sitting in a
[01:16:52] little mini van watching his house and freaking, I'm like, oh crap, I think it's like two in the
[01:16:58] morning, you know, and freaking dude walks up. Oh shit, revolver pointing at us. I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[01:17:07] freaking rolls it down. Most of the time we had a law enforcement that guy with us, but in this case,
[01:17:11] it was him and I and the law enforcement dudes were in another car up the road. And now it's like,
[01:17:16] hey bro, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, well, he's just a concerned citizen, you know, and we're lucky,
[01:17:22] you know, that could have gone so bad. Can you imagine the headline? All right, like, say one of
[01:17:27] us made a mistake and put him on the dirt. You know, an American civilian? Yeah, and, you know,
[01:17:33] so since then, I've done a couple of things where I'm at advising law enforcement in the states,
[01:17:38] meaningapolis, right? A couple of you before last, right? When that home must kicked off.
[01:17:45] And it's like, hey, man, I don't care if you're far left. I don't care if you're BLM and
[01:17:52] riding, right? You're the American. I'm not squeezing the trigger on American, right? You can't.
[01:17:58] Wrong answer. Now, if you're threatening me, that's different. But just, hey, man, if you're
[01:18:03] robbing and looting a best buy, hmm, to me, that's not something I can pull the trigger on somebody
[01:18:08] for, man. This is not in my, in my book. And it's weird, you know, it's weird, like you have to remind
[01:18:14] guys, like, hey, guys, this is not an operation. We are here in advisement. Only only if you have
[01:18:20] done everything you can to get out of that situation. And it's defensive yourself with third party,
[01:18:27] man, right? Like, because of backlash, or something like that would be huge. There was those,
[01:18:33] it was that old, the border surveillance thing. Oh, yeah, you didn't shot that guy, like, like,
[01:18:39] like, 90s. I don't know if I forgot the name of the, it was, it had an operation of names. It was like,
[01:18:44] right? Yeah, they'd sent all kinds of guys down there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The Marines shot that one,
[01:18:48] fella. And I was a big deal, and they shot that program down. And we were kind of like a part of
[01:18:53] that same umbrella. But yeah, we all just, you know, joking, it's not really that funny. Now that I'm
[01:19:00] older that, you know, yeah, post-Positcomutatus, you know, now I look back and I'm like, should
[01:19:07] the military and the agency be allowed to advise, because it's face it, right? Like,
[01:19:12] in Waco, there were two one advisors on the ground. You know, that's stuff. That's kind of scary,
[01:19:21] man, you know, because, you know, the rule of law says that our intelligence organizations,
[01:19:27] and our military can't operate here. Of course, the National Guard gets around it a little bit
[01:19:31] with that statement. Yeah. But it's scary, right? There's a reason Post-A-Comus exists. So that military
[01:19:37] can't turn its weapons towards our population. So looking back, like, I might, man, we are
[01:19:42] kids. We are joking, like, man, Post-A-Comutatus. Now I'm like, whoa, it's not funny anymore.
[01:19:48] Right? Like, you know, when you're, when you're young and dumb, you make jokes that are inappropriate,
[01:19:52] because you're young and dumb. And now I look back, I'm like, I don't know that we should be doing that.
[01:19:56] Right? Like, I know law enforcement needs help. But yeah, there's always shouldn't be getting it from us.
[01:20:01] There's definitely, I don't know, there's a positive and negative to it too, because obviously,
[01:20:06] if you have guys that can help law enforcement improve their, what they do,
[01:20:11] like, that's beneficial. And then there's two, two sides of that point too, because
[01:20:17] guys that are in the military have a certain mindset. Part of that mindset is, hey, man, we've
[01:20:22] been through this before. Somebody gets starts getting crazy. We're not worried about it. We're not
[01:20:25] freaking out. Like, we'll de-escalate in many cases de-escalate better than someone that hasn't
[01:20:30] been in these shitty situations before. But then not all military is created equal. So you might
[01:20:35] get someone from the same unit that goes, if somebody does that shit, you gotta freaking go.
[01:20:40] And you're like, no, actually, that's not the right answer. So there can be a positive,
[01:20:46] there can be a negative that both those situations, you could have somebody from the military
[01:20:52] perform awesome. You could also have someone from the military do something stupid. I mean,
[01:20:56] just because you're in the military doesn't mean you're, it doesn't mean you're, it all over
[01:21:02] the map. You know, all over the map. Some guys tactically, they were in the military for 20 years.
[01:21:07] They're tactical idiots. You know, I've gotten out a couple of times with the whole campaign,
[01:21:12] like, well, just because you're a veteran doesn't mean you're, and I'm like, you're absolutely
[01:21:15] right. Being a veteran doesn't mean that I was even good at being a military. Right? Like, just because
[01:21:22] you were in the service doesn't mean you're even good at whatever your God was in the service.
[01:21:27] So it definitely doesn't automatically qualify you to be a politician. In a lot of ways,
[01:21:32] I feel like my experience is completely make me unqualified to be a typical politician.
[01:21:40] Right? Like, I'm just, well, I'm kind of getting out here. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not a politician and
[01:21:44] never have been, and that's what our country needs right now. And my experience is in the military
[01:21:52] have set me up to where I could go do good things for our country and never become a politician.
[01:21:58] I don't have that in my blood. It's just not how I am. Yeah. As I look at everything that's going
[01:22:03] on the last six months after the downfall of Afghanistan, and then even looking at Afghanistan,
[01:22:08] Iraq, and then use compare all that to Vietnam. And you say yourself, like those lessons,
[01:22:14] every lesson that you can look back at Afghanistan and say, wow, you know, we learn this. We
[01:22:19] already knew this. We already knew this stuff from Vietnam. And so when it comes to people being
[01:22:26] in the government that are figuring out where we're going to war, I used to think, yeah, you know,
[01:22:31] somebody should, somebody should be in the military if they're going to serve in the government.
[01:22:36] You know, if they're going to be a politician, they should have, they should have served in the military.
[01:22:40] It'd be be helpful, right? I used to think that like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Like, oh, yeah,
[01:22:44] okay, yeah, that makes sense. You understand what continues to serve. Yeah, continue to serve.
[01:22:47] It's like, oh, yeah, you know what it's like, but now I'm, we absolutely need military people
[01:22:54] that are, that understand these lessons to the core that aren't just thinking with the arrogance that
[01:23:01] the generation that just sent us to war. I got it. Let's fight with fight for American principles.
[01:23:06] And but, or even worse, who's going to fight? You say we, who's the we? No, no, no, not we. Yeah,
[01:23:13] all right. Yeah, those military, those military guys. Anyway, in it, in it, funny, right? You'll
[01:23:19] hear about folks who had these awesome, blessed lives. Maybe like, Tillman and a fell football player.
[01:23:28] You hear these crazy stories about these people who had these awesome jobs or maybe they
[01:23:32] came from this awesome family and they go and he and listed it. Like, it's all to make
[01:23:38] this soon because he came from an amazing family that he should have been an officer, right?
[01:23:43] Like, that prejudice is weird. So the fact that a rich, well-to-do guy in lists and goes to fight
[01:23:51] for war, that's a story. Why is that a story? That shouldn't be a story, but it is, right? And I just
[01:23:58] use Tillman because he's such a famous story and what what an amazing man, you know, for he can
[01:24:03] pro football player, you know, with life is set for this guy, quits that and listen to
[01:24:09] Ranger Regiment, right? Like, whoa, bro, you really ask him for it. Like, that's an American stuff.
[01:24:14] But my point is, who's going to war? Typically, it's just those young,
[01:24:20] what else did you have to do with your life type of guys, you know? And in the guys, like, a lot of
[01:24:24] us, right? Let's face it, you know, a lot of upper middle class dudes and soft, you know, and
[01:24:29] you know, but and until that calling that I need to do this stuff because they're dad
[01:24:34] that's a mozzarella and they're good. But, yeah, man, Congress, right, is the only part of our government,
[01:24:45] per the Constitution that came to clear war? How is it? We've been at war for 20 years.
[01:24:55] What's the point? What was the point, right? Because in, in Delilah Bond, which has been considered
[01:25:01] for 10, 12 years now, hot spot, right? But in January, February, March of 2002, I was walking around
[01:25:10] the market without a gun. I'd hop on the ATV and jump in the truck, hop in the car with one of my
[01:25:17] troopers, one of my, F-gannies, run down, wearing an F-gannie guard, the biggest threat to me in that
[01:25:25] market or anywhere in Delilah about our all of Nango Harp Province was having the people hugged me
[01:25:32] too tightly. That was the biggest threat to me. Or maybe a car accident, a coach traffic's crazy.
[01:25:37] You know, they love this, they love this. So what happened? The conventional military showed up.
[01:25:44] So all the carinals and generals can get their stars and their awards and get their promotions.
[01:25:49] Those politicians, because it's facing it, right? Once you become a certain level,
[01:25:57] whether it's enlisted or officer, right, your career becomes that thing and then looking out for
[01:26:01] your other upper senior officer, senior enlisted, we've got to get them bronze stars, we've got
[01:26:08] in part-purple hearts, our unit needs metals, our unit needs combat, because to become a general
[01:26:14] without a C-I-B in the army. In this timeframe, you've got to go get some, right?
[01:26:20] And you're going to probably need a silver star, at least a bronze star would be.
[01:26:24] So how am I going to do that? Unless I go to war. So let's take these strikers and these
[01:26:27] M2 Bradley's and destroy roads and run over innocent people. And they weren't doing it on purpose.
[01:26:33] They're just, that's the conventional military. They have tanks. And you know, I've never driven
[01:26:39] a striker before, but I've sat in a hatch and like, how can you drive this? They would outrun
[01:26:43] it over everything, you know? And they're like, well, you do run over everything, because it can.
[01:26:49] Well, you know what, man, we made those enemies. We made the enemies. Then we're now fighting
[01:26:55] the second generation. We're fighting the sons of the men we killed in Torbore. We're fighting the
[01:27:01] sons of the men we killed in the Shai-Ka and helmet and everywhere else at the beginning of that war.
[01:27:07] We created that enemy. And the same thing happened in Iraq. And you know, let's face it, right?
[01:27:12] Afghanistan was righteous. You know, I kind of needed to fall. I looking back, is it a good strategy
[01:27:19] to topple regimes that are predictable? The Taliban was very predictable. The Taliban has never
[01:27:27] met the requirement to be listed as a terrorist organization. They were a sovereign nation.
[01:27:33] And yes, they had horrible, horrible means and human rights abuses, but they were a sovereign nation.
[01:27:39] And couldophy, sovereign nation. Freaking Iraq, sovereign nation. With dictators and dictators are
[01:27:48] predictable. They care about one thing. First and foremost, their main priority is their power.
[01:27:53] So they're predictable. You know, in the interviews with Saddam, he talks about like,
[01:27:58] I thought y'all were kidding. He was like, I thought y'all were making it up that you thought I
[01:28:03] had weapons of mass destruction and I haven't had gas in years. I don't know how many of that stuff.
[01:28:08] In his interviews, you know, he's going, I really didn't think y'all were going to invade.
[01:28:14] So why did we? I had my own theories. My theory is because people say we went to war for oil.
[01:28:22] And like, have you seen the oil prices? We didn't go for war for oil. We went to war with
[01:28:28] Iraq to stop its oil production. The prices went up. Because if we pumped oil out of Iraq,
[01:28:34] you want to make all the oil companies want to make money. Right? Because that's a new source
[01:28:39] that we didn't, they didn't have rights or access to. You stop the oil.
[01:28:46] All right. Lower the supply. The man stays at or continues to increase.
[01:28:52] It's going up. So that's a little bit of my theory on that, but whatever, either way, at least,
[01:28:59] and that's only based off of what I have seen since. When we first invaded Iraq,
[01:29:03] we were like, let's go. You know, like every other world, you know, on Trooper.
[01:29:07] But really, you know, we're talking hundreds of thousands of Iraqians, thousands of Americans.
[01:29:12] And what did we get? Right? If you tell me, you know, because war was supposed to be for expansion,
[01:29:19] minerals, riches, right? Throughout human history, war has been to expand your empire.
[01:29:25] Well, we suck it being an imperial power because we go to these wars and we do nothing with the
[01:29:31] spoils. So why do we keep sending Americans? Because let's face it. Was it really for our national
[01:29:35] defense? Or was it for our national interests? Because that's two very different things.
[01:29:41] Most of my work throughout my life has been for interests. Let's about defense.
[01:29:46] Because once Al Qaeda was destroyed and eliminated and even ISIS and Al Qaeda in Iraq,
[01:29:52] where they ever really capable of attacking us here.
[01:29:57] Yeah, you know, they flew the planes into those towers and killed 3,000 plus people.
[01:30:03] But did they ever really threaten our daily lives? Did they threaten America the United States?
[01:30:10] Probably not. You know, right? Could they ever brought that war on a large scale to America?
[01:30:16] And affected the average Americans they live? No, they didn't have that capability.
[01:30:21] And I mean, clearly, right? Like, none of that's really, we haven't had any big attacks.
[01:30:27] Since 9th November, and I think they just blew their waad. They were done. I don't think they had any
[01:30:32] plan after that. It was like, oh crap. Now what? We pissed these guys off and they're coming for us.
[01:30:39] Now what? Right? They never really did anything since. So my point is, right? Like,
[01:30:45] where has Congress been? Where has our representatives and our Senate been these last 20 years?
[01:30:51] Military industrial complex continues to make big time money, big time money.
[01:30:55] When our elicit soldiers are in barracks, they're covered in mold, just nastyness, right?
[01:31:02] They're living in poverty. Whereas you can go to the General's House on any post.
[01:31:07] And it's a well-gruned lawn and it's basically a little mansion, right?
[01:31:12] So what did we get out of these wars? Well, that's arguable, right? It's very arguable.
[01:31:18] But the bottom line is, Congress has continued to set it aside. It's authority. It's duty.
[01:31:26] It's role. It's responsibility to either declare war or cut the funding.
[01:31:33] They didn't cut the funding. A lot of people got rich off these wars. And I mean, I was a contractor.
[01:31:39] Gilti, I got paid for going to war. Now did I get paid like Glock or, you know, north
[01:31:46] or up or right the on or... No, of course not. But... Well, you got a positive outlook.
[01:31:55] I believe they're not. From my perspective, because the positive outlook would be that
[01:31:59] somebody was smart enough to figure out that if they did this stuff, they'd be able to
[01:32:05] raise the price of oil and these other... To me, that's a positive outlook to think that someone
[01:32:10] was smart enough to actually craft the things that you're saying. Right.
[01:32:14] I don't know if they actually was planned or if they just didn't stumble into it.
[01:32:18] Here's why. Because I worry about they, people are at least conspiracy theories. I'm like,
[01:32:22] I have time they can't figure out where the bathroom is. That's what makes... That's what
[01:32:26] disturbs me more than anything else is that it's the arrogance combined with the
[01:32:32] being naive, the naive to think, okay, here's what's going on in Iraq. Look,
[01:32:39] we know that Saddam's not a good guy. We can probably create some kind of a good ally there.
[01:32:44] And we can probably just turn this into a democracy because we like democracy and we, you know,
[01:32:49] we like it and all those people must want to be free too. And we've got people that came from
[01:32:53] Iraq or that are in Iraq that say, hell yeah, we want to be free. So cool. Let's invade.
[01:32:59] And in their minds, it plays out, hey, it's going to be like the first Gulf War. It'll take us,
[01:33:03] you know, a couple weeks. Then we'll start to get rid of the bath party. We'll establish,
[01:33:08] we'll start building Walmart. Right. I think that that's what they thought more than anything else.
[01:33:12] Probably. And it's just an arrogant, it's just arrogance. It's well, it's not just arrogance.
[01:33:19] It's arrogance and it's ignorance to think that you can go and, you know, there's a,
[01:33:25] when it comes to the economy, right? When you start trying to dictate, when you start having
[01:33:29] a centralized economy, it's, you cannot pull it off. You can't do it. You can't pull off a centralized
[01:33:34] economy. That's why communism doesn't work. You have to let the free market kind of do its thing.
[01:33:38] So if you think, if you, if we know that you can't control an economy, which is a finite thing,
[01:33:45] and a controllable thing, and some, in some feasible way, and we can't control it. But at least you
[01:33:52] can understand what it is. But now we think we're going to take a bunch of millions of people
[01:33:56] and predict how they're going to respond and predict what the secondary tertiary effects are
[01:34:00] going to be with what they think and how they're going to behave. Like that's completely insane.
[01:34:05] To think that we, we think we are going to control the future with other people. We think we understand
[01:34:11] what they're doing. We can't. So we have to start behaving in a way that we utilize our power
[01:34:20] to make, to attempt to influence. But we can't think to ourselves that the things are going to
[01:34:25] play out. The way we think they're going to play out because they don't. They couldn't even figure
[01:34:30] out these two freaking guys in Afghanistan. One of them is from England. Hey everyone's going to
[01:34:35] listen this guy. Meanwhile, this is local here that's been running shit for years. And we think
[01:34:40] this other guy is going to fly in from England. He speaks English. He must be smart. Everyone's going to listen
[01:34:43] him. No. No. And then you just play that out over and over and over again in a bunch of different
[01:34:48] scenarios in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in Iraq. And that's what you end up with. So that's why
[01:34:54] I'm so happy that guys like you are stepping up people that understand that we don't understand.
[01:35:01] Right. People that understand that we can't control everything. People that understand that the
[01:35:05] enemy gets a vote. This civilians gets a vote. Like all those things come into play.
[01:35:09] Right. And we run around like we can figure it all out. Nothing is too close to you. It was
[01:35:13] four. No. It's always an equation with hundreds, if not thousands of variables. And at any time
[01:35:18] you change one variable to get the continued result, you're going to have to change every variable
[01:35:24] or many of them. Right. And Americans, we couple are the arrogance. Right. So what is,
[01:35:30] I always say arrogance is ignorance and cockiness combined. And in Lord knows we are a lot of
[01:35:37] ignorance. And then you've got the cockiness. And we think we really think that people want 5G or 4G
[01:35:45] or 3G or whatever it was 10 years ago. They want that. But you've got this culture that no one wants
[01:35:50] to bother to understand. Who understands the culture of the afghanies? Who understands the culture
[01:35:56] of the Azidi and Northern Iraq or the Kurds in very North Iraq or the Shia in Southeastern?
[01:36:04] Who understands this stuff? The guy on the ground. The guy on the ground. You know, we were talking
[01:36:10] about, you know, you familiar with Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Sheller and Marine Corps. He was on the
[01:36:15] podcast, yeah. He was on the podcast, right? Right. Yeah. I haven't talked to him a couple weeks.
[01:36:20] He and I went down to the border. And I told him, like, hey, bro, I got a, so he and I joke about
[01:36:27] how we met. We talked through it. We were on with Evan and J.T. with the Plight Rifle and we were
[01:36:32] talking about how we met. It's a pretty funny story. But we went down there and we talked with a
[01:36:39] border patrol agent who's a very good friend of mine and of course, off unofficial because he would get
[01:36:45] fired for even entertaining having a conversation with a congressional candidate or House of
[01:36:51] Representatives candidate. But he talked to us and he showed us some places where he'd go and look
[01:36:55] before and broke it down for us. Nothing in the media that I had heard was anything like the
[01:37:03] border really is. At least in this section in this section of Texas around Rome and Rio Grande
[01:37:09] city. And it was just nothing like I thought because we were on the ground. He, that fellow that
[01:37:16] border patrol agent, he's the guy on the ground. I just went and got some info from him. We went
[01:37:20] driving around and stuff and looked and everything he told us was exactly the way it was. And I was
[01:37:25] like, oh, we grabbed him. But the border patrols on them basically a gag order man. They talked
[01:37:30] to somebody. They did their jobs over done. So, yeah man, kind of shellernight, the funny thing
[01:37:37] is man, he, I got word that he might run for House. He went out of the Marine Corriette and
[01:37:46] and I had an outstead either. So a friend's of ours, some mutual friend, a major who had
[01:37:53] worked for Colonel, I reached out and was like, hey, he's like, hey, does that give me your numbers?
[01:38:00] He says you want to talk to me? Like, yes, sir, you know, our career paths may be about to collide.
[01:38:07] Be nice if we could just meet face to face in chat. He was like, okay, well, I'm up in Emerald
[01:38:12] I'll, you want to come up here. Yeah, House tomorrow morning. Set down. It was like, here you think
[01:38:19] about running into fourth and he was, because apparently at that time he had told two people,
[01:38:25] the fact that I knew it blew him away. He's like, whoa, he's dead. You know, luckily my team,
[01:38:31] my consulting team are very well connected and super smart guys or whatever. So anyway, we sat
[01:38:37] in chat and it was really cool conversation. I'm talking about mature adult conversation because
[01:38:42] he could have easily been like, you know, an arrogant dick and been like, whatever, I'll run
[01:38:46] guess whoever I want. But we said, hmm, we're two very similar types. Do we really need to run
[01:38:53] against each other? I live in the fourth. He doesn't. And now it's not the fourth anymore, but we can
[01:38:58] get to that. And I was just really cool conversation a little coffee shop there in Emerald Island,
[01:39:02] North Carolina, and we left it with, and I just, you know, I gained a lot of respect for the man
[01:39:06] when he was like, okay, I tell you why I'm going to think this over. I don't even know if I'm
[01:39:10] going to get out of the Marine Corps enough time to even, you know, get in the race, my wise. I'm
[01:39:14] thinking over. He's like, we're doing an announcement this day. He's like, okay, well, two days
[01:39:20] prior, I'll let you know. He's like, at least then, you'll know if we're running against each other.
[01:39:24] I'm like, Roger that. Thanks. Anyway, the Marine Corps didn't work out or whatever, and it didn't
[01:39:30] work out for him. I would like to think he'll run in 2024, you know? I know he's considering it.
[01:39:39] I'm not going to happen in two years, but yeah, man, what a good guy. And he's definitely a Marine
[01:39:44] Corps officer, right? Like, you know, you guys thought whether he's wrong, you know, but that, we
[01:39:51] need some of that, man. We need some of that. I mean, that dude threw his 17-ounce 18-year career
[01:39:57] out the window to just stand up and say something, which is funny because like, I hear and see
[01:40:04] people on the internet, like, condemn and import. And I'm like, enlist it, guys. I'm like, fellas,
[01:40:10] we have been begging, pleading, wishing, a colonel would stand up. And now you are trying to say
[01:40:17] this, this man is doing it for recognition. Like, just sit down and talk to him for two minutes,
[01:40:22] and you'll find it out, not so much. But yeah, we were in Roma taxes and we found out, we're looking,
[01:40:30] like, the people aren't coming across the border in the middle of the desert. They're coming
[01:40:34] across, like the bridge that goes across, there's the Border Patrol checkpoint at Roma.
[01:40:38] They're walking under the bridge, coming up, hitting the cul-de-sac, and every night they get picked
[01:40:42] up by the Border Patrol buses and taking a timid facility. You're not thinking across in the
[01:40:45] middle of the desert, walking right up in the town, sitting down, getting picked up every night.
[01:40:50] That's been going on for months, right? This whole shipping them around the nation,
[01:40:54] saying, that's not new. It's been going on for months. I had no idea. Those headlines had just
[01:40:59] broke the day before. I was like, oh, a crap, when did this start happening? My buddy was like,
[01:41:03] bro, we've been shipping illegal around this country for nine months, bro.
[01:41:09] He's like, the numbers are down. Yeah, he's like, yeah, it was 2000 coming across the border in this
[01:41:15] little section every night. He was, and then the cartels figured out and they all figured out, right?
[01:41:22] That the Border Patrol can only pick up about 200 and 9 now. So now only 200 and 9,
[01:41:29] come across. On the other side, on the backside of the border, they have warehouses or hotels,
[01:41:35] and it costs the stay there. But then we let 200 each night. So the cartel, the cost to come across the
[01:41:42] border, not being fair, not good coyote, not transportation. The cartels tax or fee to walk across
[01:41:51] the border to get your armband. So you can walk across the border, it's like, armband. But the cartel
[01:41:58] gives them an armband legit. On band on our side, nothing but trash. On bands. It's like going into a club.
[01:42:07] You pay, you get your armband, you're clear to go across. Well, and armbands are color-coded from
[01:42:12] which country you come from because in those warehouses that you can see from America right over there
[01:42:18] on the mic side, they're basically hotels, it's just carts and and format. Every night, you stay
[01:42:24] there's a hundred dollars to walk across that borders, nine hundred to twelve hundred dollars
[01:42:28] going where you, where you come from. Or if you don't want to spend a couple nights in that hotel warehouse,
[01:42:36] you can pay more. But that's what it costs. In Texas alone last year, 1.7 million illegal immigrants,
[01:42:44] illegal crosses of our border were detained. But just how many were detained in Texas. Just Texas.
[01:42:50] That's how many more to detained. Now how many people came along across and this whole evolution of
[01:42:55] the book, Border Patrol and Customs facilitating the integration and fairing throughout the country.
[01:43:00] It used to be, you know, counties with continued and pickup. We destroyed that business and gave it all the
[01:43:06] cartels. So 1.7 million, let's say, a thousand bucks, times a thousand dollars.
[01:43:14] And we can only guess that double that were not in detained. So let's just call it an even three
[01:43:19] mill, times a thousand dollars. That's what we gave the cartels just in Mexico.
[01:43:25] And when I say we gave it to him, we created this marketplace for them. That's what this administration
[01:43:31] did by opening the borders. They created a marketplace where the cartels now, they don't really even
[01:43:38] care about drugs. The drugs that are coming across our border now are coming across in a backpack,
[01:43:43] not truckloads. There's no more marijuana coming across in truckloads. That's very,
[01:43:47] they're not seizing marijuana anymore. It's backpacks of fentanyl and heroin.
[01:43:53] Because 30 pound backpack of fentanyl, I can damn near kill the whole East Coast.
[01:43:59] Stuff is so potent. 30, 40 pounds of black tar, unprocessed, opium, hash, bring it to the
[01:44:05] state's process in the heroin. One backpack turns into freaking half a million dollars worth of heroin.
[01:44:11] How do we combat that if we don't get serious about true border security and even beyond that,
[01:44:19] right? Because no, no, that's one of my problems with Americans, but Republicans more so
[01:44:25] that everything's a linear solution, build a wall. And then what? No one's asking and then what?
[01:44:36] So we build this wall. We're going to do it. Put guns on it. People are like, yeah. Okay. So we're
[01:44:40] going to shoot our southern neighbors who want to come to America. Okay? I don't blame them for
[01:44:45] wanting to come here, but there's a line getting the back of it. There's a line to come here.
[01:44:52] So yes, it's got to be multifaceted, right? It can't be just build a wall.
[01:44:57] That's not solving the problem. That's just a measure to slow
[01:45:02] part of the result of the problem, the illegal immigration. Why are our neighbors wanting to
[01:45:06] come here so badly? Because all our southern neighbors, their countries are crap.
[01:45:12] Had we adhered to the monorodotron and quit worried about Europe and quit worrying about them,
[01:45:18] Middle East. I mean, we spent billions in movies. What if we'd invested that in our southern
[01:45:21] neighbors instead of letting say, I don't know, one of the richest, richest wealthiest countries in the
[01:45:26] world, Venezuela, fall of communism right underneath our noses? Why? Why did we do that? Why are we not?
[01:45:34] Actually, hoping, Mexico. Oh, we want to take these hard lines and look like a bunch of tough guys.
[01:45:42] It's not solving the problem. And it kills me that that's all all these solutions, right? When you
[01:45:49] like all my opponents across the nation, if you if you talk to Republican candidates for any
[01:45:53] office from city council, probably to the next president, they're going to have one
[01:45:58] linear solution for any problem you talk to them about because what talking points. But no one's
[01:46:04] actually discussing root causes of problems. So the border security, a wall, is a measure, not a
[01:46:12] solution. It's not, it's not going to solve the problem. You're building a wall, well, there's these
[01:46:18] two bodies of water on each side of it, right? You know, the deal, there's not a single security
[01:46:25] measure put on this planet. Whatever you build, whether security protocol you build, there's
[01:46:32] just guys like us that can get around it, right? It's just like lawyers, right? Lawyers can write
[01:46:36] about to legal documents and then some other lawyers can figure out how to screw that. It's the
[01:46:40] same thing. It's not warfare. It's like, you're going to be does this. They set up these obstacles.
[01:46:46] You figure out how to get around them. Well, here's an idea. Let's address it at its root cause.
[01:46:52] And I don't know, maybe the demand to come here. Well, let's say 20 years from now. Oh my God.
[01:47:04] And that's not an American thing, right? 20 years from now? Next election cycle only.
[01:47:08] Four years old, right? Americans think in four year blocks if we're lucky. What if 20 years
[01:47:13] from now? Mexico is a thriving ally. And there's no cartels. We help them get rid of it. We give
[01:47:20] them incentives to stop teaming up with the cartels. Same goes for Panama, Costa Rica,
[01:47:27] and at Garagua, Salvador. We help them with the game problems. We hope them. And I don't mean just
[01:47:32] toss money at it. Wece money. When I say invest, right? Invest means there's a implied return on
[01:47:43] that investment. Americans, when our Congress just allocates funds, they just throw money in things.
[01:47:52] They don't actually follow up or have measures in place to ensure our return on investment.
[01:47:59] So my point here is, man, that's part of why I'm running is I'm so tired of these very
[01:48:03] literal band-aids to hemorrhaging wounds. And the wall is just one great example of that.
[01:48:12] I mean, name any other hot topic right now. Abortion, banning. The same people that say banning
[01:48:21] abortion will solve that problem. The same people that will tell you that banning guns won't
[01:48:26] get rid of guns. Where's the logic and reason here, folks? So like with abortion,
[01:48:33] yeah, man, it's horrible. I mean, even people who are pro-choice will go, yeah, it's bad.
[01:48:39] And it's very, only the craziest of the crazy are like four abortion, right? That's human beings are
[01:48:45] not for killing unborn children. Generally speaking. So why are we having abortions?
[01:48:55] Let's make a middle eagle. Okay. Cool. Let's make a middle eagle. We're done. But we're not done.
[01:49:00] Could we just have it addressed? Why are we? Why are women wanting or feeling that need
[01:49:08] to abort their unborn child? First of all, the three of us will never, ever be able to
[01:49:16] understand sympathize with a woman that is so desperate that she wants to abort her child.
[01:49:24] Right? I just, first of all, we have to say that out loud, right?
[01:49:28] Okay. So let's bring in the experts. Let's talk to some ladies. I know that sounds crazy, right?
[01:49:34] Let's go find the subject matter experts and figure out why this is happening. Well,
[01:49:40] I asked people all in time, what's the number one demographic in America having abortions?
[01:49:46] Do you guys know? Put your on the spot, right? Yeah, I was a little surprised too. 17 to 22-year-old
[01:49:52] upper-middle-class white women. Why? Well, because their fathers have told them they need to
[01:50:00] go to college because modern feminism have told them they need to go to college. They need to get
[01:50:05] careers in a child in heaven's now. Right? And this is a very summarize version of this very,
[01:50:15] very complex problem. So what if we as a community, as a government, right? It's okay for the
[01:50:24] government to do things for the community, right? Like we can, we can have some good social welfare
[01:50:30] problems, right? Things that support the wellness of our communities and our culture and our nation.
[01:50:38] So when I use welfare, I don't mean just throwing money at stuff and not expecting some type of return.
[01:50:43] So if we start saying okay, what if we create a robust and efficient adoption program?
[01:50:52] What if there's assistance for these women to carry their children to terms that have
[01:50:58] terminating them? What if? And I say what if? Because I don't know the answer, right? And that's
[01:51:03] weird for a political candidate to tell you he doesn't know for sure what he's talking about, right?
[01:51:07] But we know that, right? We come up with courses of actions and then say, okay, we're going to do
[01:51:13] this and then we try to anticipate what our adversary is going to do if we do X, they'll do Y and
[01:51:18] then this is how it, well that's how we have to war game all these things, right? So if we sit down
[01:51:24] and say okay, because here's a really bad thing about the adoption process in America today.
[01:51:31] Mimilists are not married, right? We see marriage as an agreement between Xi and I and God,
[01:51:36] not the state of North Carolina. Also, she's a very pragmatic, practical person and she wants to
[01:51:44] hold the whole thing that if she gets tired of me, she can just boot me or walk away.
[01:51:49] How long have you all been together? 10 and a half years. We're married. In my eyes, my heart,
[01:51:54] my soul, I married to that woman and she's the most precious thing on this planet to me,
[01:51:58] right? Like precious. She's the only one. That's how precious she is. So if Xi and I wanted to adopt,
[01:52:06] it could take three to five years. If me and you want to adopt, right? We could have a kid in the year
[01:52:15] or less. That's how our cultures evolve now, right? A gay couple can adopt very quickly.
[01:52:22] It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. Or, Mimilists could go out of the country and
[01:52:28] buy a child. We could adopt from Africa or China or the space that you're buying a child when you do that.
[01:52:34] Because it costs a lot of money, but you can do it and you can do it in a matter of weeks.
[01:52:40] Typically speaking, when someone adopts out of Africa,
[01:52:44] different countries different way, right? But you go over, you visit, come back,
[01:52:48] go back for the next trip and you have your child. It's efficient. And it's a good thing, right?
[01:52:53] Like these are parents who want children who can't have them for whatever reason.
[01:52:58] And then there are these children that need parents. We have so many in America,
[01:53:03] but so why are Americans leaving America? The United States to adopt children from other countries.
[01:53:08] When we have kids right here, we have an abortion problem. Why? Because it's easier.
[01:53:15] You know, like, let's face it, right? I mean, let's say, let's say Melissa couldn't have kids.
[01:53:21] It's not why we don't have kids. We don't have kids because it's just kind of a choice. We've been
[01:53:25] busy. She's been busy with her career and I've been busy with mine. And so if we wanted to, it takes time,
[01:53:37] but we could go get a kid. It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense. So my point to all that is,
[01:53:43] whether it's the border or abortion or name it, you've got all these candidates and these politicians,
[01:53:51] right? Because right now a lot of politicians sitting already elective politicians, they're now candidates.
[01:53:55] Again, midterms are coming. They have these one lineers, these talking points.
[01:54:00] And then they go back to DC and they don't really do anything. It's so frustrating to me, man.
[01:54:06] Because let's face it, right? We're problem solvers. We're given problems every single day,
[01:54:11] whether it's how to fit that much equipment on that one truck, because that other truck is deadline.
[01:54:16] Right? Or supply won't give us another truck, because some sort major, we need that truck
[01:54:23] for his ride to the Chalhall or whatever. We solve problems with very little. And at this point,
[01:54:35] in our nation's history and future, present and future, we need those type of people.
[01:54:42] Need guys from our community and gals from the global world, terrorism, those type of veterans,
[01:54:50] who are problem solvers, who have seen the neglect and the abuse and the fraud waste and abuse.
[01:54:57] That's what these wars have been. Afghanistan highlights it. But people don't realize how many
[01:55:01] billions of dollars of equipment we left in Iraq too, that we had to destroy in Syria, because they
[01:55:07] just took it, drove it across the border and then bought us with it. But there's still billions of
[01:55:12] a billion of dollars of equipment in Iraq. Now we haven't abandoned Iraq. We abandoned Iraq too.
[01:55:20] It was just less publicized, less emotional for a lot of the servicemen and women, because of
[01:55:27] just the way I've got to stand happen. So quickly, it was really easy for the media to cover,
[01:55:32] so on and so forth. And then all the debacle in Kabul, what the airfield, that was definitely
[01:55:36] the media love, and I don't fancy you. Yeah, it was a disastrous show. I rack happened over
[01:55:44] a course of numerous years. And they're not interesting. Probably not coming up. So anyway,
[01:55:51] one thing I talk about a lot when I talk about leadership, I wrote about one of the books
[01:55:56] iterative decision making process, which means you don't know necessarily what's going to happen
[01:56:02] and you don't necessarily have all the information. So what do you do? You sit there and just
[01:56:06] do nothing? No, you go, okay, well, here's a step that I think this might have an impact
[01:56:10] a positive impact. Let me try this one step. But you try that one step. Then you get what the
[01:56:15] feedback is. If the feedback is good, you say, until you get it. Okay. Well, that was good. Let's
[01:56:20] do a little bit more in that direction. Okay, great. Oh, but it's still working. That's super.
[01:56:24] Oh, let's try a little bit more in that direction. Oh, wait a second. Now we're getting negative
[01:56:27] feedback. What we thought was going to happen isn't happening. Do we double down? No, we actually say,
[01:56:34] oh, let's make some adjustments to what our plan, what our strategy is. And that's what was as you
[01:56:39] look at Afghanistan and Iraq and Vietnam. You can see inflection points along the way where
[01:56:49] the direction we were going was not clearly giving good feedback. Now do you immediately abandon it?
[01:56:55] No, maybe press. Okay. Let's try a little more. Let's make some adjustments. Oh, wait a second.
[01:56:59] Oh, wait. It's definitely not working. Okay. So what should we do? We should try a different plan
[01:57:03] we should try a different strategy. And we shouldn't be afraid to say, you know what? We were wrong
[01:57:07] about this and we are going to back out and we are going to provide a different type of effort
[01:57:13] to try and solve this problem. So like you said, a lot of politicians, a lot of, that's just
[01:57:18] politics. People, human beings don't want to say, hey, wrong. I messed up here. I was wrong about this.
[01:57:25] Here's my adjustments. Here's what we're going to do. I'm open to ideas. COVID.
[01:57:30] Good. First, we're talking about all of us. We're like, okay. Yeah, man, I started carrying some
[01:57:37] hand sanitizer. I, you know, I put Melissa go back together for the first time. I'm not really a
[01:57:45] proper. I'm more about wealth. She has fan. I've got enough that I'll be able to make it right.
[01:57:49] I'm being brought to the home. I'm good, right? I'm mentally bad. You know, she drives back and forth
[01:57:54] to Wilmington, you know, an hour. So I was like, you know what, you know, she competes in three
[01:57:59] gun and she's doing some of the tactical games and all that kind of stuff. I mean, she can shoot,
[01:58:03] right? She goes to rank fireself and I, you know, she's got her own info and all that kind of stuff.
[01:58:07] So we actually packed it up through a little 72 hour go bag in her trunk, right? We were all like,
[01:58:12] this pandemic might be something within about six weeks, we were like, hmm, and we all knew
[01:58:18] like these cloth mass, right? Like we've all done Seaburn, right? We've all done some counter
[01:58:22] proliferation of biological nuclear. And it those, those suits and the gas mass and all these stuff,
[01:58:28] right? It's like that might stop over that might. And now you're telling me this mask is
[01:58:33] like, we all knew it was just horses. No, I got a handkerchief all I'm good. Hi. And I think maybe like you
[01:58:39] said like, with the right, we, you know, I don't think it really, like it didn't, it started out good
[01:58:44] in intention. Yeah. And like you said about Afghanistan when we got to Iraq, there was, there was
[01:58:49] Iraqis wave in American flags and welcome, Mr. And they wanted us to be there. And even,
[01:58:55] I was there in 2003, 2004, 2006, all the way that through that time, there was the local Iraqi
[01:59:01] populists wanted us there. And by the way, in 2012, 13, and when I started to flex,
[01:59:11] there was there was plenty of Iraqi government officials and people on the ground saying,
[01:59:15] please America, please come help us. Hey, we need some help over here. We weren't thinking
[01:59:19] to these guys would come back, but here they are, and we need some help. Please come help us. So we can't
[01:59:25] ignore the part of the population, that wants that, right, when you call the problem, you're kind
[01:59:30] of obligated to deal with it, right? We call that problem Iraq. I was all forward with withdrawal
[01:59:37] and the Obama administration that withdrawal. But once they decided that we're going to withdraw,
[01:59:41] there came a point when ISIS rose up that we needed to halt the withdrawal, deal with ISIS,
[01:59:45] and then pick back up with the withdrawal. But since they started the withdrawal, they couldn't
[01:59:50] say they made a mistake. Americans will never, we just don't like to say they're there. I told
[01:59:55] to my other day, I was like, I will kiss your white ass live on whatever social media platform you
[02:00:01] want to go live on. If you can find me a politician and elected official that has said,
[02:00:06] you know what? I realized now I was wrong and find me one politician who has said that.
[02:00:12] Yeah. And the crazy thing is from an ego perspective. People think if I say, hey guys,
[02:00:17] all is wrong about this, you think everyone's going to think you're a loser now. No, they actually
[02:00:20] go, yeah, well, cool. I'm glad you admitted that and we didn't know either, like you were bringing
[02:00:25] up the example of COVID. Hey, okay, it looks like a bunch of people in Italy are dying. They're showing
[02:00:30] these pictures of people dying in the hospitals. They're all overcrowded. This looks like it's going to
[02:00:33] suck. Cool. Oh, you want us to stand down for a few weeks here. Cool. We're going to flatten the
[02:00:38] curve. What does that mean? We don't want our hospitals overwhelmed. Okay, God. We need time to
[02:00:42] prepare. Sure sounds good. Okay. Now we need another two weeks. Okay, hey, hey, you know what?
[02:00:48] I'm American. I support American. I want to have people get her. Okay, cool. God. When I
[02:00:52] you want another two weeks, now you want another two months, now you want another six months,
[02:00:55] now you want another year. And then after a year, we find out that the death rates,
[02:01:01] you know, most of the people aren't dying from COVID or dying from something else and COVID accelerated.
[02:01:06] And that's fine. I get it. You know, but we now have information and data, right? That says
[02:01:14] all the measures that we did they didn't help. We've got a vaccine that really isn't, right? By,
[02:01:20] you know, they had to change the definition of vaccine. Yeah. Right? Like, could you imagine
[02:01:25] getting three polio vaccines and then getting from a polio? Yeah, that's not right. We got rid of that.
[02:01:32] That vaccine got rid of that disease, right? This vaccine supposedly makes your symptoms less.
[02:01:39] But it could kill you. Right? Like, it that's one that says this one one drug we haven't seen
[02:01:47] commercials for, right? Because all those drug commercials and TV is like when they when they get
[02:01:51] into the fight for it, you know, speaking really fast about all the side effects is like, and it could kill,
[02:01:55] you know, you could have crazy diarrhea and you could bleed from your nose and maybe your
[02:01:59] anus and then you might very well die from this kidney failure, you know, and people are like,
[02:02:04] okay, but ask your doctor, but your skin will be clearer after two weeks. Right? Could you imagine
[02:02:11] what the, you know, Johnson and Johnson vaccine got pulled, right? Why? Let's not talk about it.
[02:02:17] Let's just talk about another vaccine because of that J, J is vaccine killed some people.
[02:02:21] American people don't even know so many people don't even know that Johnson and Johnson vaccine
[02:02:25] was pulled and then it had killed people with strokes and you know, thanks to your medical
[02:02:30] terms and I know. Huh, right? Like we won't just step back and say, hey, we now have different
[02:02:37] information. We're going to adjust this plan. Yeah. And by the way, on that, you can say, hey,
[02:02:43] there are, here's the fine print on the vaccine. Here's what it can do to here the side effects you
[02:02:47] can have and make a choice, you know, as a human being, if you have some compromised immune system
[02:02:54] or you're living in some situation where this COVID according to all the statistics could be really
[02:03:00] bad for you. Maybe that vaccine is a godsend. That's awesome. Maybe a mask is great for you.
[02:03:05] Yeah. But if you're a person that's young and healthy and you feel like you could, oh, and you know,
[02:03:12] a bunch of people that I've had it and it didn't impact them at all and you say, hey,
[02:03:16] I don't think I'm going to need that vaccine. It doesn't seem like it's worth the risk. So that's
[02:03:19] my decision. So you let people make a decision about what they're going to do with their health,
[02:03:23] that seems like a much smarter move than trying to impose things on people, which I've gone
[02:03:30] off on this a bunch. When you try to impose things on human beings, we fight, especially Americans,
[02:03:35] they don't like it. We don't like it. But all human beings don't like it. All human beings don't like to
[02:03:39] have things imposed on them. And the only way you can impose things effectively is to do it through
[02:03:45] force, through violence or now we're recently finding out that you can also do it by
[02:03:49] taking their money and seizing their assets before they can even know what's happening.
[02:03:54] Which I never, I never really thought of that before. It didn't even occur to me that like what's
[02:04:00] going on in Canada right now. Oh, you're going to protest cool. We're not just going to rest.
[02:04:04] You're going to seize your assets. That to me is like when you come to my property and you say you're
[02:04:10] going to take my house the same thing. So that is a problem. And Canada, it's just so hard to watch.
[02:04:18] And you got law enforcement guys who just a few years ago or not even two years ago,
[02:04:24] they were being defunded and demonized. You know, they're in a whole blind lives matter thing.
[02:04:28] And now these same police officers are ones that are literally trampling on people. And I was like,
[02:04:37] you know, please, hot, don't let it come to that here because I have a lot of law enforcement
[02:04:42] brothers. And we all know that good men follow orders and good men that need to take care of their
[02:04:49] children will follow orders. Good men have to take care of their family and rely on that paycheck.
[02:04:54] They're going to follow orders. That is scary to me because they do that. We'll be at that point
[02:04:59] when I'm like, hey, law dogs, I love you. And I've always supported you, but we are now in two
[02:05:06] different sides. Right? Like when you use like what's happening in Canada, man, they're siding
[02:05:11] with Trado. That little turd, I usually don't, I try not to talk about presidents,
[02:05:19] elected, especially elected presidents of sovereign nations in that kind of
[02:05:24] derogatory term, but wow, you want to talk about some of that warm and knit that he's wrong
[02:05:29] and double down on every step. It's like I just won't lose. And he's got an arsenal. He's got a military.
[02:05:36] He's got a national police force man, a national police force scares the shit out of me dude. I don't
[02:05:41] like it when I see feds wearing multi cam and military stuff, right? Like it makes me uneasy.
[02:05:46] I don't like seeing local PDs wearing B to use. Right? I want to, I like some shy and shoes.
[02:05:52] Like no yellow hat, we patrol still wears a police uniform. They look like police officers,
[02:05:57] not military members. I still don't like it, man. Even I want my law dog friends to have
[02:06:02] every tool available to them to do law enforcement. But there's some things that I definitely
[02:06:08] am not good like no, not warrant, and stuff like that. They're not necessary. And we learn that.
[02:06:13] So if you be as dangerous, let's just not come out. Oh, you don't want to come out.
[02:06:19] I'll okay, cool. Just turn your power off. We'll play some loud music. Maybe send a robot in with
[02:06:24] some gas. You'll come out. You'll get tired of this, right? Yeah, the no knock warrant thing is
[02:06:29] definitely something that needs to stop. Yeah. Our law enforcement needs some help, right?
[02:06:34] Yeah. It really does. Across America, law enforcement in general needs help. The average law
[02:06:38] dog's a good American. Yeah. And even up in Canada, I don't think that that's going to
[02:06:45] continue in this direction. The direction that's going right now, I don't think it's going to continue
[02:06:49] this direction. I think it's going to, yeah, I think it's going to stop. I think the only reason
[02:06:54] that that's is what's going to happen is that the people that are pressing like Trudeau,
[02:06:58] they're actually just a bunch of places. They think they want to fight. But, you know,
[02:07:05] do they really want to fight? Once the bullet start flying and stuff, you know, and things get
[02:07:11] pressed, I think ultimately we're going to see Trudeau step down. I just looked at my
[02:07:16] watch to recognize the date. So it's the 21st of February when we're recording this right now.
[02:07:22] So be interesting. Be interesting to see how it all washes out. I hope that's what I'm going to
[02:07:27] do not want to see Canadian shooting Canadians. No more than I want to see American
[02:07:30] shoot Americans. You know, do you even like, you know, Americans are still mad about the whole
[02:07:36] riots and the black live matter stuff. And rightfully so, because it was all perpetuated and
[02:07:40] funded, you know, black lives matter. Those folks on the streets, riding, they were ponds of
[02:07:46] rich people. And that's that's sad, right? Because sometimes I feel like we've been a little bit
[02:07:51] appalled out in the war. So I can kind of relate. I'm not mad at young black or young Hispanic,
[02:08:02] or whatever group or even even young antifa, you know, white kids who are riding and breaking
[02:08:09] stuff. They're pissed. Are they going too far? Absolutely, right? We have the right to protest
[02:08:16] peacefully, but not break shit and so on and on fire. That's wrong. That's riding, not protesting.
[02:08:22] But again, root cause. That whole mess was perpetuated. It was funded. I mean, it
[02:08:28] would palates a bricks that just poof showed up and, you know, what's the root cause? It's the root
[02:08:35] cause, man. What's really going on? How do we reach out to even more so, you know, like our
[02:08:42] poor communities, poor inner city communities, which oftentimes are predominantly black, but also
[02:08:47] Latino, your poor white communities tend to be rural, right? Well, why are these things happening?
[02:08:54] What is the perpetual process that keeps these communities in their situation? Well,
[02:09:02] modern welfare system, and I don't mean the good kind of welfare, like wellness society. I'm talking
[02:09:07] about our the EBT and all these things. There's no, there's no, it doesn't help people get out of
[02:09:16] those situations and perpetuates it. It destroys the nuclear family. And it was, you know, we can
[02:09:23] go back to LBJ, you know, with the modern welfare programs. There's plenty of quotes out there
[02:09:28] that they did it on purpose. They knew what they actually planned that stuff, right? Like,
[02:09:32] I think back in the 50s and 60s, the intelligence agency in our government, they were a
[02:09:36] pretty sinister and they were thoughtful. They weren't just meandering, right? And you can go back and
[02:09:40] look at what they did and how they approached it and then it bansed on, saying Nixon, that whole bunch
[02:09:47] that were raised out of World War II in a fear of socialism and communism. You know,
[02:09:55] that FBI hovers FBI, that CIA, you know, I mean, man, it was, they were proficient. I feel like they
[02:10:03] knew what they were doing. And so they created that welfare problem. And here we are today,
[02:10:08] no one's ever really came up with any decent solutions. The only real welfare reform our nation has
[02:10:13] ever seen, actually came from Clinton. He actually proposed some things that would help the inner
[02:10:21] city become more productive in valve citizens. And then all that expired and no one's done anything
[02:10:30] since. And I think it's funny, you know, you got the Democrats who manipulate and coerce those communities
[02:10:40] for votes. And you got Republicans who were just like, it's not even worth it to talk to them,
[02:10:44] they're just going to vote Democrat. Oh my. Recruitment 101 folks, you've got young angry people,
[02:10:53] the systems not working for, let's go talk to them. Let's come up with a real welfare reform.
[02:11:00] How do you, you, proves, that's another one, right? Just cut off welfare, tell them to get jobs.
[02:11:07] That's the average white man in America's where you can answer to welfare and poor
[02:11:13] inner city problems. Just cut it off, tell them to get jobs. Yeah, okay, we're talking about
[02:11:18] decades and generations. Cultural change. We have cultures that are based around this problem.
[02:11:26] You think you can just turn off welfare and just tell them to get jobs, there's your answer. That's it.
[02:11:31] Okay, and then what? Okay, and then what? I had an awesome, I met a fellow who's running for
[02:11:40] Fayetteville's mayor. Fayetteville for Brad, you know, going on. And I never thought about it
[02:11:47] this like this and I have only had a few days to even think about it. But his proposal was this and this
[02:11:52] guy is an immigrant. He's Puerto Rican, which, you know, part of the states but not a state.
[02:12:00] So still an immigrant. Raise poor nine brothers and sisters, poor family. Anyway, he said,
[02:12:09] hey man, what is? Let's say you've got a mother, a single mother with four children.
[02:12:18] All right, and some people would say, well, she just keeps having more children to get more welfare.
[02:12:23] Okay, maybe that's true in some situations. I don't think that's true across the board.
[02:12:27] I think in a lot of cases, these mothers have more and more children.
[02:12:32] Maybe they don't have access to birth control. Maybe they're not super educated on on just on
[02:12:38] sex education in general, right? Whatever that problem is, we have this person, their reality.
[02:12:43] Right? They exist. This family of the single mother with these four children, it exists. They exist.
[02:12:50] How do we help them? How we fix them? How do we get those four children to grow up to become
[02:12:54] productive, involved, US citizens? That's the question. What his answer was this. I
[02:12:59] say she's getting $1,400 a month from all the different programs total. That's about what she's
[02:13:08] getting. 1,400. It's poverty, bro. But if she gets a job, she loses all of it. She gets a job that
[02:13:17] only pays her $1,000. Now she would be at $2,400 a month. Now she's just barely getting by still.
[02:13:25] She's still in the poverty. But the second, she takes a legal dollar or something. It's not under the table.
[02:13:31] She loses every cent of her welfare funding. How does that incentivize her or her children to
[02:13:38] go do some? So he was his plan and I was like, huh? He said, let's lower it.
[02:13:46] Let's take some welfare away. I wasn't expecting you to say that. Here's how he said he said,
[02:13:51] okay, let's knock it down. Let's cut that that $1,400 to $600. She doesn't get a job. She gets $600.
[02:13:59] She gets a job and maybe she makes $500 a week. She gets an additional $100 a week from welfare.
[02:14:08] So she makes more. She actually starts getting more. So let's say she goes from that $1,400. Now she's
[02:14:14] making $2,000 in addition to her own. She's making $2,000 a month at her job. She's going from that.
[02:14:22] $500 or whatever initial instead of the $1400. Now she's at $1,000. Well there's a certain
[02:14:29] point in which she makes enough money to actually pay for her own welfare on tax dollars.
[02:14:35] Now pays for itself. The incentive is for that lady that you don't want them to go work harder
[02:14:43] to make money and now she will actually pay for her own welfare. It's a zero-sum game for American
[02:14:48] taxpayers. And I was like, oh, we should have never had that before. Never thought about it like that before.
[02:14:55] I always thought about it like the more you make the less you get from welfare.
[02:15:00] Like if you're making $1400 welfare and now you're making $2,000, you're only going to get $7.
[02:15:04] He's like, no, no. It's copped, right? It's not like she just keeps making. Now she's making $200,000
[02:15:09] years. She goes $50,000 in welfare, right? No, it's copped. There's a point in which it all goes away.
[02:15:15] And he even said he goes, now maybe there's actually a pyramid where it goes up no
[02:15:19] certain amount and as she continues to write more, it goes down in a little bit and then it's
[02:15:23] ended but it's all based off of and he's like it would take a lot of work.
[02:15:29] Because everywhere in the nation the cost of living is different.
[02:15:32] So you'd have to build it around all of that. He's like, but it would work and it would fix the whole
[02:15:41] problem. He's like you would be addressing the animosity and the resentment that taxed
[02:15:46] paying hard work in Americans having its welfare recipients. That stigma, right? That whole
[02:15:52] just can't smell fair type. Well now the welfare recipient is paying for its own welfare
[02:15:58] for their own welfare. Not it's, right? That's the humanizing. I mean you do that. But that person is
[02:16:03] now paying for their own welfare. I was like wow. But I'm like you can't be the only person.
[02:16:09] You know, this, you know, put a reek in American that's running for mayor in a family.
[02:16:14] You mean you can tell me that only person is ever thought of this? And probably not. He's just
[02:16:18] the only person that ever told me about it. And I was like, I've just never thought of that. Right?
[02:16:22] It's never been in my entire life. Have I ever, I've never had to sit down and start thinking
[02:16:27] about viable ways to in the welfare state in America? It's not been a problem that I had to address
[02:16:34] in my military career or my small business, right? You know, not a problem. So now that I'm
[02:16:41] running for a house of representatives, it is something that I got to start looking at and I was
[02:16:45] blown away. So again, back to my point of the problems are never too close to equals four.
[02:16:52] I'll say I think that easy. No, it's never that easy. And when we, when we have that conversation
[02:16:56] we sit back and say, hey man, you know, this isn't working. We need to adjust. Just like
[02:17:01] man, if we're in route to a target, you briefed your puttune, right? I believe my, you know,
[02:17:07] troop and ISR reports back, ooh, no, there's not 15 mo foes on this target. Man, there
[02:17:15] are having some type of get together. There's 40 mall dunes on this target, you know, and trucks.
[02:17:21] And what appears to be some PKMs in those trucks, we thought it's going to be easy target on
[02:17:26] it off, right? Nice little fun Tuesday night. I saw this report in something different. Do we go,
[02:17:32] yeah, Roger that, click, and hang up. We're not talking about anyone. I'm not even going to brief
[02:17:37] my, my troopers. No, we probably come to a little tactical haul, huddle up. Unless discussed this
[02:17:43] at the key leaders are going to sit down and chat, right? Is this a salt force even able to take
[02:17:49] that target? Well, probably not. Okay, well, let's head back to the house. We made a mistake,
[02:17:54] right? Based off an information out, we didn't make a mistake. Based off an information,
[02:17:58] as it changed, let's just hit pause, you know, or maybe we request more air. If we
[02:18:06] person's going up and we don't hit the target, we let the air force do it for us, or the navy,
[02:18:10] or the Marines, or whoever's flying for us that night, you know? It's so frustrating, man,
[02:18:16] because it's like, you know, there's, there's eight SF guys running for for US House
[02:18:22] representative. There's seven seals. And like I said, 25, 30 global long terrorism, veterans.
[02:18:32] You know, somebody asked me another day, well, what sets you apart from these other candidates?
[02:18:38] We're all concerned, it is. We all pretty much agree on how to, you know, the, we all have the same
[02:18:42] stances on everything. The difference between the first difference between me and some of my
[02:18:49] opponents is spine and shoulders. Right? And I don't mean that in bad way. Like, I mean it
[02:18:55] and like, because they're good people, right? The folks I'm running against,
[02:18:59] Sands probably one of them are good people, good people who really want to go change. And if you
[02:19:05] ask them, they're going to capital Hill and they're going to save the planet. Here's reality.
[02:19:11] Reality is a freshman brand new representative in Congress has zero influence and no friends.
[02:19:17] Labius don't even knock on their office door. They got a little cubby hole in office over in that
[02:19:22] other building. There are nobody's. So they look for friends. They make friends with lobbyists and
[02:19:31] other little groups and caucuses, right? And the incumbents, the 345, 20 term representatives,
[02:19:41] they recruit them. They do them favors. Now we got clicks and this is politics and this
[02:19:47] is the grossness of it. Here's what aside from me not being willing to compromise, right?
[02:19:54] I've said straight up, four terms. If America or North Carolina have district 13,
[02:19:58] through whatever, whichever district I want to run in four terms is all I will do. Period.
[02:20:04] We need terminus. Whether or not we can get that pushed through or not if when I'm up there,
[02:20:09] different story I'm still not going to. I'm a self imposed my own term. I don't want to work
[02:20:13] in DC. One of my opponents recently told me I was a ignorant wannabe. I was like,
[02:20:24] except for the differences. I was like, you're absolutely right. I am pretty ignorant to it.
[02:20:28] Exactly the kind of bullshit you guys are doing in politics. But you're wrong about the wannabe
[02:20:35] part. I'm not a wannabe. I don't want to run for Congress, but because of people like him,
[02:20:41] American needs us to run. Well, I'm not willing to compromise. That's the biggest thing.
[02:20:48] I'm not, you know, I say this all the time. I'm not even mad at Democrats.
[02:20:54] I'm pissed off at Republicans who have compromised our rights away.
[02:20:59] They keep thinking somehow that they can negotiate or not even negotiate because I'll clarify
[02:21:05] the difference between negotiate and compromise. They keep compromising with the left and the
[02:21:09] Democrats thinking they're all going to get along and come to some time of agreement.
[02:21:13] Democrats just keep taking that shit, putting it out back, pulling it up. We got some more from them.
[02:21:19] We got some more from them. Republicans go, well, if we keep playing nice with them,
[02:21:23] maybe one day they'll be our friends. No, man, the Democrats are hellbent on creating a
[02:21:28] communist regime in this country. I mean, they don't care what you think. They don't want to be your
[02:21:34] friend. They want to get rid of you. They want to replace you. And we see this playing out in this whole
[02:21:40] politics right now. All of a sudden, you keep saying everything like what's the, what's the,
[02:21:43] what's the cure for COVID midterm elections? All of a sudden the mandate, the science says, no,
[02:21:49] bullshit. And for you know, there's no, there's no, the COVID numbers haven't changed at all. The
[02:21:55] science hasn't changed at all. Midterms are coming in Democrats know they're about to lose and the
[02:22:01] across the country through boards of elections and every different means they can. They're trying to
[02:22:05] protect their what they have left. And we see it in North Carolina with the redistricting and all this
[02:22:10] nastiness. But anyway, the number two thing that sets me in part is that group of veterans,
[02:22:18] those green braids, those seals when we show up. Let's say half of us, right? Let's say there's
[02:22:24] 30, it's just over 30, global entourage, I'm better and young, vibrant, not old gray hair, crippled old
[02:22:31] man, easy on the gray hair, bro. You're not old, you're still vibrant, you know, there's, uh,
[02:22:40] I keep looking at how I does, right? We're still young if most of the 20 year old troopers,
[02:22:45] the 20 to 30 year old troopers and the teams are on the ODAs. Don't want to fistfight.
[02:22:51] The second they know that we're not able to, you know, hold our own, then we're that old line
[02:22:58] and it gets pushed out of the right. You know, but I would say right now the average 20 to 30 year
[02:23:04] old soft trooper doesn't really want to throw down with you. One of them, right? I mean,
[02:23:08] some of them wouldn't they probably will parole us? There's we're going to be somewhere the next
[02:23:12] day no matter what. But the difference is they know we got this old knowing where either highly
[02:23:18] aggressive, violent and smart, right? Like you don't get through 20 some years of war just being
[02:23:24] lucky, you know. And I always tell them that, you know, I'm still in 20th group, man, I teach
[02:23:28] down on our subfowse course and I'll pick on the young and it's not gonna be like, okay, whatever man,
[02:23:32] you know, that that fun, you know, shooting a shit, talking whatever you want to call it and I'm like,
[02:23:36] okay, whatever man you want to fistfight? On the outside, I look like I'm ready, you know,
[02:23:43] ready to get after it. On the inside of my please look, God don't let his stay fixed by.
[02:23:47] Don't let this get fixed. I actually want to take the upper this offer because it's going to hurt so bad.
[02:23:54] But yeah, man, could you imagine 20 global war on terrorism veterans, right? 12 of them,
[02:24:03] special operations guys. Swine oath for a second time on Capitol Hill,
[02:24:10] the Democrats shaking in their boots because they know they just lost and the Republicans going,
[02:24:19] we're gonna have to ask those guys, those newbies, these freshmens,
[02:24:24] we're gonna have to really team up with these guys and work with them.
[02:24:30] That's some stuff that could change America's trajectory. And that's the difference in between me
[02:24:36] and some of my really good opponents, good people, right? I got, I got guys running a district against
[02:24:42] me, man, he's a good old boy, good old country boy, we talk after meeting, we hit it off and I was like,
[02:24:46] man, in any other time you and I met, we just be hunting fish and buddies. He's a good Carolina boy.
[02:24:53] And I told him, I was like, hey, man, tell you what, don't you just let me and my buddies go up there
[02:24:58] for a couple of years, I told you I'm out. I just is not a career for me. I'll do everything in a
[02:25:02] world to help you run after I'm done. Of course he didn't take me up on that off. He's so convincing
[02:25:09] and big me. And maybe you can, but that's the cool thing about democracy, right? I have to show the
[02:25:15] people in this district that I'm the best candidate. I can't just say I am, I have to go show them.
[02:25:21] And so anyway, man, it's so, so interesting stuff, not so much. It's like so simple, but it's not easy.
[02:25:35] So, little side track right there, you get, you get done with Afghanistan, you go do some
[02:25:43] stuff, work with law enforcement, whatnot, and then when do you end up going to Iraq? Just before
[02:25:53] the invasion. And so Iraq happens, all that goes down on up north and made more friends, more
[02:26:03] Kurd friends, more friends over at the agency, and because we were basically doing that events prep
[02:26:08] for Northern Iraq with the Kurds and everything. So you got there before the invasion and you're
[02:26:14] up with the Kurds and you're prepping for what's going on? The war's coming, right? Yeah, so, you know,
[02:26:20] a vision goes down, freaking, I was running around like Mozzle, Kirkuk, to create all that stuff.
[02:26:29] Are you with those, ODI 18? I'm actually one of the, one of the SAT teams, okay. Because I'm
[02:26:35] that young kid that doesn't like an SFGAT, right? So, really cool. Yeah, Iraq happens and then,
[02:26:46] in my next trip to Afghanistan, I got bumped off a cliff, I broke my back. How to get bumped off a cliff?
[02:26:55] One of our partners tripped, we were walking down, he was above me, he tripped,
[02:27:01] 80, 90 pound backpack, nice, you know, freaking offset and feel. How far were, how long were the
[02:27:13] cliff? Probably fell 15 feet, enough to, you know, basically when he hit me, you know, I kind of like
[02:27:21] feet went out and landed basically on my ass, like my feet were kind of out in front of me,
[02:27:25] little outcropping and it, that rock side just, just split my, L5, how much did you weigh at this point?
[02:27:35] You jacked it, because you cut it. I'm trying to put on some kick talking about spawning.
[02:27:39] Yeah, you cut it. Now we're, you know, three years into the, into the war, four years into the
[02:27:44] war, man, I've been hitting a weight pile like everybody else, I'm probably like a buck 85 and
[02:27:48] yeah, man, it just bent me over, split my vertebrae, part of the very rate hit my spinal cord,
[02:27:55] the prognosis was you might walk with crutches one day. So when you like paralyzed on site,
[02:28:02] bro, that hole, I can't feel my legs, yeah, I didn't experience that, because I could feel it
[02:28:07] and it hurt like hell. Right, if you took this dude, put it in a fire, got it nice and orange,
[02:28:13] and stuck it in the side of my spine back here, that's what it felt like all the way to my toes.
[02:28:20] It was, it was like I was on fire. Did they cast it back you? Oh yeah,
[02:28:25] spent three or four months in a brace doing a little chair thing, freaking got better,
[02:28:33] really fast. So within a year, I'm running again. Well, my ETS date came up and I had a flight pack
[02:28:39] in. What if there'd be a pilot? I thought, you know, my ground pound in days was,
[02:28:45] I had already done everything we could, right? How many more countries are we in VAT?
[02:28:49] Yeah, I thought my ground pound in days was over and these are patchy gunships keep flying in
[02:28:54] and just doing all our work. I'm like, I'm a good bear. Yeah, they got like, they could only
[02:29:00] work a few hours a day in my, man, these these one officers, they can fly for the rest of their
[02:29:05] lives, you know, because the Army has a worn-off's their program. I don't know. So I put it on
[02:29:10] packet. All I had to do was get home and go to flight school. It's going to be awesome.
[02:29:15] Well, that clearly changed. I thought my career was over. So luckily, those friends that
[02:29:19] had made it to agency, I got out and I initially took it to get medically retired or,
[02:29:26] young and dumb man, my intent. I thought I was going to go contract for a little while, get
[02:29:31] better and then I would come back in the Army and flop. Just take some time off and there's
[02:29:36] all these awesome contracting jobs out there, paying awesome. Oh, nice. These kids, you're the
[02:29:40] national guard so you could say, hey, I'm non-deployable for a while. I'm going to see you love,
[02:29:46] but you'd still be in the national guard. But I got a contract. I got a completely, you got
[02:29:50] our completely. Yep, you call them. Because at this point, the guard has figured out that they're
[02:29:55] just imaging dudes to contracting. So you got all these batangins commanders. What year,
[02:30:00] you're coming? So, O405. Oh, yeah. This is like 1500 bucks a day for contracting stuff.
[02:30:06] Shutting it down and they're like, nope, you still got to be at your drills. You still got to
[02:30:10] meet your commitments. Whereas in like, oh, 203, you had company commanders jumping in and
[02:30:15] they were like, yeah, I don't care if y'all show up or not. And if you think about it, right? Like,
[02:30:19] you've got your troopers overseas doing, you know, at least combat isch type stuff, you know,
[02:30:25] it was a good thing for the guard. You had guard guys that were getting exponentially more combat
[02:30:32] experienced through contracting than the active duty groups were doing because they were just rotating,
[02:30:37] you know? So it was a good thing for the guard, but it wasn't good for their numbers, right?
[02:30:42] They looked good. They, that guys that weren't getting their online training done, you know?
[02:30:46] Right. Like, you got to do your E.O.s your sharp strength, right? It was killing those numbers
[02:30:51] for these commanders. So they shut it down. So I was like, screw it, I'm out. I'll just come back in.
[02:30:57] You know, I'll go make some money, whatever, by a house or something, which is, you know,
[02:31:01] it was exactly what I did, but as I got better, you know, I went, became operational again.
[02:31:07] And so to doing cool stuff, way cooler than the army, ever was going to let me do.
[02:31:13] This is as a contract. Yeah. So I never went back in or I didn't go back into fly.
[02:31:18] Um, and at one point it was kind of funny because I did go back in and join 20th group,
[02:31:24] uh, like 2012, which I'm still in. How long was it? But that's a pretty big gap though.
[02:31:29] Yeah, like seven on the state years. Seven eight years. And were you contract in a whole
[02:31:33] time? Hold on. On stop. I stayed really busy with that. Of course, I started the gym. I would come home.
[02:31:38] I got lucky, man. You know, teamwork, right? It makes a dream work when I started my gym,
[02:31:43] which I opened it in January of 2008. That's when this gym opened. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool.
[02:31:51] You know, 2008 I was going nine months. I opened a gym, luckily the team that I put in place,
[02:31:58] ran it like it was their own. They did an amazing job. Amazing job. Good friend of my
[02:32:03] Darren Canclerman. He just did it. The young lady I was dating at the time, Julie. They ran the
[02:32:09] damn thing. And so I could come home and be the war hero that showed up, the run the gym,
[02:32:14] and take over for a minute, and ruin their lives. You know, they had a plan to make a good
[02:32:18] thing. Nope. I'm doing it my way. You know, like, no, hopefully I wouldn't like that. But,
[02:32:22] you know, intrinsically, that'll happen. But they just didn't awesome job with my gym.
[02:32:27] And I could, I could stay deployed. And I did. And the gym grew. So that was cool. It was kind of a
[02:32:34] parallel there. And the gym was great. You know, it was supposed to be just a little cross fit gym
[02:32:40] that, you know, guys like us, marine recomboys and Marciac dudes, because we're just south of
[02:32:45] the gym coming there, take their shirts off spit on the floor, throw up if they want to.
[02:32:50] And we'll just thrash ourselves. And then regular people started showing up. Right? Like soccer
[02:32:55] moms and stuff. And you know, I'm still at this point in my life. I'm like, hey, you, you know,
[02:33:01] you, you stop being a pus and, you know, maybe stop being so many donuts fat so. And you could
[02:33:07] tag on be a PT stud too. Well, when 33 year old, 36 year old mother of two or three that
[02:33:15] drives a suburban pulls up, you can't talk to her like that because she won't come back.
[02:33:22] And those are also the people that have the money to pay their gym for their shifts.
[02:33:25] Those colleagues kids that are studs that you want to train, they ain't got no money.
[02:33:30] You know, you got to at least pay the light bill. So I quickly figured out how to talk
[02:33:36] to regular people. You know, you can't be like, hey, Sally, maybe cut out that bottle of wine
[02:33:41] and that box of donuts every night. You might be able to do a pull-up.
[02:33:46] Yeah, she's never got a pull-up. She was looking for her. So now you had, you know, I had to,
[02:33:50] I was real adamant about not being that creepy gem owner. And you know, who was like, you know,
[02:33:56] have any type of fratinization of clients and stuff like that? I was a big deal.
[02:34:00] And I did start that gem with a partner and it quickly figured out it wasn't going to work.
[02:34:04] Not a bad separation or just like he couldn't move to women.
[02:34:07] And yeah, man, it was that gem taught me a lot about teaching,
[02:34:12] you know, just how to talk to people. You couldn't, hey, Ranger, you know,
[02:34:18] hey, Sally, come here. What's going on? You know, you, you, um, hey, when you're ready,
[02:34:22] if you like, um, let's sit down and you know, maybe line out some nutrition, a diet,
[02:34:26] it's enough. You know, nutrition, not diet, right? Those words mean something because if you say something
[02:34:30] to a lady who needs to drop 20 pounds, you know, if you say, let's talk about getting you on a diet.
[02:34:36] Oh, my God. Oh, you just, she's gone. She hates your guts. But if you're like, hey, look,
[02:34:40] let's tune this up. You know, man, your shoulders are starting to get really defined. You know,
[02:34:44] you're looking great. And that was a cool thing about CrossFit, right? Is that women's upper body
[02:34:48] started to develop? And, you know, you clearly can't be that creep and talk to her about her legs
[02:34:55] or any other, you know, lady parts or whatever. You know, you can't be, hey, Sally, you know,
[02:35:01] your, your mom's looking great. You know, that's, that's inappropriate, right? It's not professional.
[02:35:05] And so, you know, I really learned how to, to talk to people and then motivate them and
[02:35:10] bring them into the fold. And you know, before we know it, that was one thing my gym was so well
[02:35:15] known for, I'm so proud of it is that our women monsters and people would come to me like other
[02:35:22] gym owners and stuff like, what are you doing to motivate and turn these women into these monsters?
[02:35:31] Right? We sent like, I don't know, um, 18 different athletes through the CrossFit games.
[02:35:36] Out of a town of only 150,000 people, very good. And it was just, I didn't even have to recruit
[02:35:44] once it started. We had one of the original super strong females. She just showed up. She was a
[02:35:48] volleyball player, powerful, right? She could very coordinated that touch, in only lifting before
[02:35:54] you know that she was like throwing weight overhead at most of the dudes in the gym couldn't touch.
[02:35:59] And so people started hearing about her and then it grew and then her and then a handful of others
[02:36:05] and next thing you know, I've got these, I'm looking for dudes. Our thing was the team events.
[02:36:10] I love the team events. I don't know. The individuals is cool, right? And the whole different
[02:36:14] level, but the team was fun and I'm all about building a team. So our teams did really well,
[02:36:20] but there were years where, you know, a couple years where we didn't, the team didn't go to the
[02:36:25] games because the guys on my team weren't strong enough to get us on the podium at regionals.
[02:36:31] It was never the girls, man. I trained one young lady. She came in the gym of, of Fino,
[02:36:38] right? Like just this diamond in a rough fast twitch, powerful. She had been a soccer player,
[02:36:44] a swimmer at ECU. You got pleasure. Hard. She just imagined the most hard-headed
[02:36:51] Ranger young, still pump you ever dealt with. This was her, man. But like the first time she
[02:36:55] ever deadlift, she picked up over 300 pounds. I walked in with a stop stop stop. What are you doing? Who
[02:37:01] is she? Why is she picking up that kind of weight? She's clearly new. Right? Horrible for him,
[02:37:05] but just powerful. So anyway, that's a problem. She, she, she could have been an individual athlete.
[02:37:12] She had that type of genetics. She went a different route. That year, I couldn't put her on my team.
[02:37:17] She just wasn't ready yet. She couldn't work with the team. She came in a little late.
[02:37:21] She had everything going for. I was like, hey, in the interim, let's play with strongman.
[02:37:27] Right? We just started getting strongman equipment. It was getting more and more worked
[02:37:30] into the CrossFit stuff. And we kind of did a pure thing. And some of the gym members,
[02:37:34] you know, I was that guy who was, I was like the most anti- CrossFit
[02:37:37] CrossFit gym owner on the planet. I was like CrossFit was supposed to be to get you in shape.
[02:37:41] So you can go do cool stuff. You want to try a triathlon. You want to try, you want to,
[02:37:46] you know, whatever, you know, I never really saw CrossFit as like becoming a sport, but I can
[02:37:51] help, but I like to compete, you know, let's get in it. So anyway, this young lady came really
[02:37:55] long. She, as a hey, let's try strongman. So she did like a local event, crushed it. It's too,
[02:38:02] it's, and still it's super strong. Well, that event qualified her for the worlds at the Arnold's
[02:38:08] name. She weighed 165 pounds naturally. She never touched any drugs. And Stralman has not
[02:38:16] a tested sport, right? So the middle weight class and the females are them is the most competitive.
[02:38:21] And it's a 140, 180 pounds and most of the girls cut from 200. There's, you know, 511, 6 foot tall,
[02:38:28] 200 pound females. And like I said, not tested. Can we go to the Arnold Brown and Wins World,
[02:38:36] our second strongman competition wins it. She didn't cut. She walked on, walked in the competition
[02:38:41] home 65 pounds. This is what she waited the time. I mean, she's probably five dollars nine,
[02:38:47] five eight and nine, just naturally, well, not naturally. She had been an athlete in college, right?
[02:38:52] But just exploded. And you said she swam and played volleyball? Is that the one?
[02:38:55] And soccer. Okay, just aggressive too. And just like the host. She should, at the time there
[02:39:05] wasn't a good MMA presence in Womington. That's where she should have gone. That's where she
[02:39:11] should have gone. As one of the gyms, Saltre and those guys stood up in an MMA gym there and
[02:39:18] had that been stood up out of center over there. I mean, go kill with people with a little bit of
[02:39:23] training this chick would have been scary, right? She was, and she would go with her and training
[02:39:27] and play and she went to the little phase where she was doing some striking and stuff. And I was just like,
[02:39:31] God, man. Anyway, long story short with her, she kind of got involved in the wrong people and
[02:39:36] stuff and I didn't coach anymore. I'm freaking, but what an amazing Gika. And like I said,
[02:39:42] man, it was just so cool that our females were so well known when like every lady on the team is
[02:39:49] snatching 200 pounds deadlift in three plus. Like Kimberly was deadlift in 500 pounds in a
[02:39:56] buck 70 and had abs. You know what I mean? She did not look like a powerlifter. And this is just
[02:40:01] the ladies we had. They were just badass. You know Melissa went to the games. She was just the
[02:40:07] small one. She was the bodyweight one. And as CrossFit matured, now the average CrossFit females
[02:40:13] like a buck 65. And those girls are big. So Melissa, she can't compete with them. She can't move
[02:40:18] the weight that they do. But yeah, and Melissa was instrumental in helping, once Melissa realized
[02:40:26] she wasn't big enough because last time we went to the games, you know, Dawn was, you know,
[02:40:32] probably at the time 1665, a girl, man, a 150 pounds, another volleyball player. And Jordan
[02:40:42] probably 150 pounds. And every single one of them were deadlift and 400 pounds, cleaning
[02:40:47] and jerking over two. I mean, these chicks and running subsicks minute miles. Like what
[02:40:52] that? And I mean, you know, luckily that last year the boys were all big boys and studs. But
[02:40:58] Melissa was, you know, an amazing, amazing coach to those ladies. She was just once, you know,
[02:41:04] the deal, once you realize you ain't ever going to be in the ring again, right? Like you can
[02:41:08] either, you know, what is it? Those who can't do teach. And that's just really same for me,
[02:41:14] right? Like as I got older, I was like, I don't stand a chance of being, you know, involved in this
[02:41:18] sport, but I can dance or coach and people to it. But yeah, the gym was amazing, man, freaking,
[02:41:23] it was lucky that I could run it in a parallel. Once me and Melissa started dating, I started,
[02:41:28] I went to her face right into Poirre, whole lot. I'm doing my teaching stuff states, I, and
[02:41:34] I was, how would patrol for an in mind, asked me to start helping him, like teach some firearms.
[02:41:39] His father had a nice range of stuff in my gym, man. Why not? You know, he was going through a
[02:41:45] divorce and needed some money. So I was like, yeah, you know, he's like, yeah, I think, you know,
[02:41:51] with your background, you know, we can, we can bring in some people and that's how the whole
[02:41:57] shooting part of my business kind of started was just trying to help a buddy that needed some,
[02:42:01] you know, money because he was going through a divorce. And so that turned out, man, I, I just don't
[02:42:07] know how to do anything half as, right? They're going to do something I'm doing, you know.
[02:42:12] That's why I like all the physical stuff, the triathlon, the ultra marathon, so I put myself in a
[02:42:16] hospital after the big foot 200, not after because I didn't quite finish my 177, I'm pissing blood,
[02:42:23] grabbed him my leases, freaking, I was in bad bad. How many hours into it was,
[02:42:28] right? It's probably 70, some day three. Yeah, you familiar with the company,
[02:42:36] softly. Yeah, so brand, I don't know them, but I know who they are. Yeah, so brand, one of the,
[02:42:43] the founders and owners, Marciac, do a good friend of mine. He joined me at my 112 with that race.
[02:42:50] And I was already in bad shape from like a section of race. It was a lot of downhill.
[02:42:54] Well, first we don't have mountains where I live in North Carolina, so I trained up here on a
[02:42:59] stairwell. Do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go to the gym and spend four and five hours
[02:43:03] walking on a stairwell. miserable miserable stupid, but I said a goal, you know, I'm running,
[02:43:11] at this point, this point, my life, I don't like running anymore, right? I just, I don't want
[02:43:14] to run 200 mile race. Why? To say I did. Well, yeah, man, that race, one of the sections
[02:43:21] is about 11 miles all downhill and I ran this shit out of it. And your muscles weren't used to that
[02:43:27] quads destroyed them destroyed them. At my 112, I was already pissing blood. And that's from
[02:43:33] the window. Yeah, my kidneys were hurting. I could feel it. I felt like somebody just worked on my
[02:43:39] freaking back man. And by my 150 something at that age station, that was the last time I could
[02:43:46] even keep watered down. My TBI was definitely flared up. I had a lot of damage to my brain
[02:43:52] STEM and stuff when I got blown up in 2009. And the M&I, I was in bad shape. And I wanted to
[02:44:01] sleep. He wouldn't let me sleep. Come to find out later. He was like, yeah, I was worried
[02:44:05] you were going to die because I was having a seizure. And I was laughing about it. You know,
[02:44:11] I had convinced myself, you know, you know, they're doing. I knew how we we can be. And I just took it
[02:44:17] too far at by mile 177. And I'd gone, you know, almost an entire night, 20 some miles without any
[02:44:24] food or water, no sleep. Just, you know, Brent was just trying to get me to the next aid station
[02:44:32] because it's in the mountains of Washington state around Mount St. Helms. They have no EVAC plan.
[02:44:36] There's no way. And I'm probably the biggest runner on the course, right? I'm doing these 200
[02:44:42] mile rays at like 215 pounds, you know, and I had lost weight to do it. You know, I think I
[02:44:48] usually walk around a lot about, you know, 225, 230, it's your whatever. And I cut some weight to go
[02:44:52] around this race. And how many months did you prepare for it? Like a year, you're in a half.
[02:44:58] So we trained for about a half a year for the 2007 big foot Melissa Torherman Nyskus at like
[02:45:05] mile 120. And so we stopped at mile 133. We were doing it together. And I had time, but during that last
[02:45:15] trek, I didn't want to leave her. It was cold, way colder, and it was supposed to be. So we didn't,
[02:45:20] I mean, teeth chattering. We were both hypothermic and she's busted her knee, can't move fast.
[02:45:27] And so like mile 132 or three that aid station, we got there in time. And I could have taken off
[02:45:34] with no rest or whatever and got to the next one, but I probably wouldn't have finished a race.
[02:45:39] Right? I was just now as behind. And I would have never left her on that mountain, right? Like
[02:45:45] especially hypothermia. You know, she's, she's never had hypothermia to where she was, you know,
[02:45:52] freaking disoriented or something like that. And you know, just clearly, I wouldn't have left
[02:45:59] a runner. I didn't know in her shape much less about leaving the most precious thing on this
[02:46:04] planet to me. So we got to that aid station. I'm like, you know what? Screw it honey, we started it
[02:46:09] together. Let's go get some breakfast together. You know, someone's coming up. So we drove back to Portland,
[02:46:14] had some breakfast. The next year, she decided to do it, but we made a deal that we wouldn't do it together.
[02:46:20] No preconceived notions. Her knee was still not healthy. She's like, I'll try it. I mean, that
[02:46:25] says a lot about her, man. She's like, I got this energy. I'm going to give it a whirl. She did like
[02:46:29] 77 miles in dropped, only 77. She was busted knee. She's probably worse than us. But yeah, man,
[02:46:39] at my ones, 176, 177, whatever it was, Brent was like, hey, man, I'm a runner ahead and make sure
[02:46:47] the crew's ready. No, he was running ahead to make sure the medics and the doctors were there so they
[02:46:51] could drop my ass. 200, five miles, man. You know, so had, you know, whatever it was, 29 miles
[02:46:58] or something left. And I get there and then like, yeah, here's the drop paperwork. I'm not signing
[02:47:05] that. I'm twitching, having seizures. My trick is freaking, like, not working correctly, you know,
[02:47:13] my, so some of my damage and stuff, I used to be left handed. I'm right handed now because this
[02:47:18] didn't work for a while. Like, I couldn't hold on to things. I definitely, but worse, I would have
[02:47:23] a seizure. With your holding the glot in your hand, seizes, probably a good thing. So I switched
[02:47:29] to be the right handed. All that was happening. I'm like, seizing and it's a, it's not a muscular
[02:47:35] seizure. It's a sand s-seater and it's just weird. It doesn't hurt, but when it happens, it looks
[02:47:40] weird. I was going to say, look at this point. And bro, the pictures of me, I'm gray. Right,
[02:47:47] that whole dehydrated. My body temperature was 96.40 degrees. And my heart resting high rate was
[02:47:53] like a buck 60 laying down a cot. You know, when you lay down, your heart rate should drop me,
[02:47:58] my didn't. My body's freaking out. And I'm convinced, I got, it's only 29 miles. I've got this.
[02:48:06] And luckily, luckily, one of those five people I chose around kind of scared of was helping me.
[02:48:13] And he was like, hey, Bubba, you can either get your ass in that truck. I'm a put your ass in that.
[02:48:18] Either way, you are done this race. And next time I'm here, I woke up in the hospital,
[02:48:25] important in Oregon. How long was recovery from that? That's a, that's a more fun story.
[02:48:31] Three weeks after that, on the last day to register for the Moab 240 mile or I went and got my blood
[02:48:39] work done, 88% kidney function. I'm like, all right, I'm good. And I signed up for the Moab 240.
[02:48:45] And how far away was that at the time? As far as, like how much time did you have before that?
[02:48:50] Two weeks. Oh, it was only two weeks away. Last day to register for the Moab. And here's my
[02:48:56] thought process. Oh, I got to hear this.
[02:49:02] Because they hurt. And grabbed a hurt a lot more. It hurt of raptor, right? You know,
[02:49:06] CrossFit made it famous. Everyone, you knew what raptor was. I knew, you know, but we all give
[02:49:10] ourselves micro cases of it. And then we take days off. The reason, there's no days off in a four
[02:49:15] day to an hour. So you don't get to recover. You know, he gets worse. Well, three weeks after
[02:49:22] I go in and I'm like, okay, I'm trying to figure out, do I try another year? Because this is
[02:49:26] the first thing in my life I've been after. First half ever did not finish. You know, man,
[02:49:31] I've been like, first time goes and every hard course they ever sent me to, you know, and like,
[02:49:35] this isn't, this isn't making sense to me. Volunteerly withdrawing the year before because Melissa
[02:49:40] was hurt. I was okay with that. And like, it didn't hurt my feelings. You know, it didn't feel like I had
[02:49:46] somehow compromised, you know, my soul. Your integrity is a man. Now, but now the big foot,
[02:49:51] all right, I just think I'm always trying to kill me. And I'm like, hmm, okay, there's this
[02:49:54] mo lab 240. It's all ran by the same people. I might just mo lab 240 miles. It's actually 240
[02:49:59] three miles. Just like the big foot 200 is 25. I'm like, y'all need to fix your t-shirts because
[02:50:05] that's not my check. A five mile. That's like a race in the area. So I'll give me credit. I want to
[02:50:10] cut it. So the mo lab 240 to 143 miles. In my head was, okay, do I train a whole another year?
[02:50:17] And when you train for a 200 mile, you're doing not going out at midnight and train until six
[02:50:22] in the morning just to get training under your headlamps and stuff like that. It's miserable, dude.
[02:50:26] And this point in my life, I'm not a runner anymore. And I don't enjoy training it.
[02:50:30] I shit. Since then, I think I've ran about six miles. And that was 2018, right? And it's all been like
[02:50:35] a three different on the PT test I had to take. You know? Yeah, I ran my bicycle now. I'm out and
[02:50:41] bike and stuff. But anyway, yeah, man, I'm like, okay, I can train a whole other year. Maybe I
[02:50:46] go knock out this 240 and just check this box and say I did a 200, right? It's 240. It should be good.
[02:50:52] Make up for this disaster, silliness of the big foot. Last day of registered. I was down in Alabama,
[02:50:58] teaching 20 scripts of fat cores. I drove to one of those local blood workplaces. I had my
[02:51:04] labs pool interpreted it in myself pretty much qualified for that. Because you're going to be an 18.
[02:51:10] No one for it's you're getting close. Man, I've done some nutrition counseling for people with
[02:51:14] the gym, right? I can get a crit in teenage levels or almost back in normal. Almost.
[02:51:20] Right? And like, all right, walk out the parking lot. I signed up for the 240.
[02:51:27] Clearly, I know it's not a good idea because I didn't tell anyone until a couple days before already
[02:51:32] had an 18 delta mine. It was going to, you know, crew me at the race and that just basically
[02:51:36] means drive the truck from one eight states into the next and the truck is a place to sleep.
[02:51:42] And so, yeah, man, I got into my 240. So, I always say that, you know, dumb dumb ranger Tony
[02:51:47] did pick foot where I was like, I'll sleep in hour and night and I'll just keep moving and I'll
[02:51:52] keep banking extra hours. Well, the Moab 240, I had just approached completely different.
[02:51:57] I'm gonna sleep two hours to three hours every night and I'm gonna use every second of time
[02:52:04] to make it from here to here. I was trying to bank time and go fast. Now you build up this extra
[02:52:11] ton. When you're having people remember my finished time with that Moab 240?
[02:52:17] Zero? I don't even remember what it was. All I know is I finished it and I got a picture of me
[02:52:22] walking underneath a finished line. And I did have about six hours of spare, six-day hours of
[02:52:28] spare, whatever it was. But the point here is unlike the big foot where I was trying to go so hard
[02:52:34] and not sleep, I walked every step of the way, the last except for the last 13 miles of 243 miles.
[02:52:42] I rocked it. You know, and you're just wearing one of them silly little vests, you know,
[02:52:46] it might maybe 10 pounds enough to get you in between eight stations, which you know,
[02:52:51] are pretty considerable. You're talking about an A6 and A6 and A6 and 20 25 miles.
[02:52:55] You know, like marathons. It's not like a marathon or a ZA6 and every mile.
[02:53:00] This is milling nowhere, nowhere, Moab. So yeah, man, I got crazy shit out and
[02:53:06] freaking, I was so fresh and okay that hopped into truck and said to stay in Moab,
[02:53:13] drove back to Denver. So yeah, man, freaking good experience. Don't necessarily recommend it
[02:53:20] anyone. But if you do get a wild hair and want to run at one of those races,
[02:53:26] give me a ring or a DM and I'll tell you my strategy. My strategy was rock,
[02:53:31] March, the whole way. The only reason I even ran the last 13 is, I mean, it run the whole way.
[02:53:35] As I linked up with a dude that I had met at the big foot and we checked it in.
[02:53:41] But I wouldn't say that we ran the whole 13. We just picked up the paste, did some jog and Moab law.
[02:53:46] But yeah, man, you know, I just got to get after it. You know, and purpose, you know, like
[02:53:54] we talked about that whole having something, I don't know if you get dramatic, say having something
[02:54:00] to live for, but that's ultimately what it is. And yeah, I stay busy. These days,
[02:54:06] I'm over the craziness. These days, my PT is all about just staying healthy, so I can go hunting.
[02:54:12] You know, that's it. I just, that's my only real hobby I have left. As long as I'm fit enough to throw
[02:54:18] a 60 pound backpack one and go hike around the mountains and, you know, that's where I'm out in life.
[02:54:24] I'm done. You know, Melissa's still getting to have to get it, just cross yourself in the gym.
[02:54:30] I'm in there like, I think I'll do back and buy it. Maybe maybe just, you know, chest and
[02:54:34] try the day, you know, and then a nice little light leg day, like my dead last man. So I just turned
[02:54:40] to 46 and I was like, all right, you know, for fun, let's put some weight on there.
[02:54:45] 500 for three on a deadlift. I'm like, hmm, still not old yet. You know what I mean? I'm still
[02:54:49] counting on it. But typically speaking, man, 400 on the deadlift is all I do and just do some
[02:54:54] reps. I'm not trying to hurt me anymore. Because there are a lot of the stuff that I did, man,
[02:54:59] my back hurt, my, you know, TBI hurt, always on that edge. And where did you get blown up?
[02:55:06] In the rack. Yeah, um, freaking armored sedan, I demit for a striker.
[02:55:14] Yeah, sucks. Man, I was the only one I've for in the vehicle to walk away and I didn't walk away.
[02:55:20] Yeah, um, suck, man, freaking. We just happened. We were, we were the Mark car for the Ranger
[02:55:28] Edge man. They were, they were going to action a big target for us. Where was it? No, not,
[02:55:33] right, uh, Mosul. And so we basically, we were going to identify, we were going to identify the gate
[02:55:40] that they were going to drive the strikers through just by simply pulling just past it and parking
[02:55:44] into that point by the time they got there, I would already be out of the vehicle. Last thing I
[02:55:48] remember is buckling my helmet, putting the buckle on. I just put my helmet on. And so yeah,
[02:55:54] it was, um, you know, it's a level seven being W, but it's, you know, their bulletproofs, not last
[02:56:00] proof, not definitely not EF people. EFP hit, um, right behind the rear seat. So the two boys in the
[02:56:10] back seat man, they were DNAed and, uh, driver, I guess he died, you know, eight or ten hours afterwards.
[02:56:17] The, um, a funny story man, like, you know, talk about small world stuff a few years later,
[02:56:23] I'm running one of the training courses for the NSA, for them, for their security guys,
[02:56:28] participating in that. And I was into the class, everybody got picked in this one young
[02:56:34] Ranger or whatever, you know, throughout the class we had talked about, yeah, I worked for those
[02:56:37] people. I was in Mosul, Bumbleblin, you know, because he's a student, he didn't ask until afterwards,
[02:56:43] you know, they're by graduated, let's go get, you know, a stay, can some beer and he's like,
[02:56:46] hey, uh, eight Tony, um, did you know that, that team of guys, that agency team of guys, or whatever,
[02:56:52] um, up in Mosul, that, you know, they got blown up the whole team died, I was like,
[02:57:01] hmm, I mean, 2009, and I was like, yeah, yeah, we were up there, man, we were, I was in
[02:57:08] the Ranger, I mean, we helped recover that. We were on target for that, we were going to do that.
[02:57:15] And they threw me in their structures, they thought I was dead. Because the reality is right,
[02:57:20] I mean, it blew that car across three lanes. It was a main highway one, kind of Broadway.
[02:57:27] We were in the right lane about to make a right turn into the neighborhood where the target was.
[02:57:31] And it's why I just buckled my helmet. And, uh, at EFP, blew that car all the way across three lanes,
[02:57:39] big medians, you know, the medians are there and stuff, right, across that, across three lanes and
[02:57:43] down to alleyway. Yeah, hitting other cars, right, it wasn't a small idea. And how I lived, man,
[02:57:52] I can only talk that one up to God, you know, and um, man, it hurt the blast injuries hurt.
[02:58:00] I came to in Germany and it hurt everything hurt, man. Like, I say, like, my fingernails hurt.
[02:58:08] My gut, splash gut, my lungs had a demon, my lungs. And, you know, the armored car probably,
[02:58:15] you know, clearly saved me, blah, blah, blah, but yeah, man, my whole left side was screwed up,
[02:58:19] freaking just from damage to that, and brainstorm, and all that stuff. And yeah, and that was why
[02:58:25] you were a contractor. Because you ended up going back in, right? Yeah, I am. I, uh, I,
[02:58:32] uh, 2012, I was like, you know what, you know, freaking, I did these, you know, this eight years,
[02:58:38] maybe I should go back into guard. I could help the next generation, right, you know,
[02:58:43] what's that thing about good intentions? I say that if you get out of the military and
[02:58:48] go back into military, it's like taking your car, drive it into a parking deck,
[02:58:53] putting in it reverse and then backing over the spikes and blowing your tires on one purpose.
[02:58:58] That's what going back in the military is like. And I joke, I do joke, right? So, the, uh,
[02:59:06] I'll try and keep that in mind. Because in all the time, I, you know, those mornings when I wake up like,
[02:59:10] you know, I can probably not call some people. Yeah, I'll take me back there.
[02:59:15] Right in rock and roll. No, I, um, I, I just went, and so I worked for ASD at Bands Skills Detachment,
[02:59:22] the group level ASD. So I get to teach the courses like our CQB course of Fowl.
[02:59:27] And it is worth it. But the guard is its own beast, right? There's like all the BS that you would put
[02:59:33] up with with the active duty military. And then there's the guard. It has its own personality,
[02:59:38] its own type of crap. And because it is part time thing for so many people and the few full
[02:59:44] times that they, full timers that they have, they're trying to manage, you know, on half staff,
[02:59:50] all these guys who all have problems who are all the most important people in their own lives,
[02:59:55] its Valleblah. Luckily, I have an amazing admin staff where I work and stuff and they keep
[03:00:00] us squared away. But, you know, it's still the military. It means because we're not full time,
[03:00:05] we have to jump out of our asses to do stuff, you know, the budget, blah, blah, blah. Hell,
[03:00:12] Alabama National Guard sent a bunch of people to DC after the January 16th. The federal government
[03:00:19] has still not paid Alabama back for that, right? And that's across the board. There are
[03:00:26] National Guard across our country that don't have funding to pay people. So, like some of
[03:00:31] our full time guys in October when the fiscal year rolled around last fall lost their jobs for like
[03:00:38] three weeks. It's like what? And these are people with mortgages and families and stuff,
[03:00:44] you know, is their job? I'm like, oh, no, we don't have money because you know, Joe Biden don't want
[03:00:48] to be a real-time job. So, the O.S. and his money. Right? Of course, you don't actually,
[03:00:53] who signs the budgets, the Congress. So, is it Joe Biden's fault? Or is it a representative
[03:01:02] as well? I don't know. I mean, I always go back to this, right? First page, Ranger Amba,
[03:01:08] the leader is responsible for everything it does and does not happen when a mission or a patrol.
[03:01:15] So, anyway, I got grass. But yeah, the guard man, it's good. I get interact with the young guys
[03:01:20] on the up-and-comers, share some lessons learned and it's worth it. But, you know, if I go
[03:01:30] teach, so far for four weeks, I'm back to make an army money. So, you know, you lose money,
[03:01:37] doing it. And sometimes, you ask, is it worth it? I gotta go put up with this BS and, you know,
[03:01:44] whatever. But then I remember like, hey, man, we now have a service full of all the combat.
[03:01:51] That's got, there's no combat that has left in special forces. It's for the most part, right?
[03:01:57] Same with the seals, man. I get some guys from up Virginia Beach that come down and use my long range.
[03:02:03] All young, young pups and their snipers, I'm like, I thought snipers were supposed to be like,
[03:02:07] the most experienced dudes are like, we are. Like, are you like 22?
[03:02:12] Like, 26. Like, so you mean to tell me, you were one of the most experienced dudes in your
[03:02:18] pool of 10 when you're in the 10. Now, I'm 30, yeah. Like, yeah, man, everyone within the experience
[03:02:25] left. I'm like, well, crap, it's the same in the army, same in the Marine Corps.
[03:02:31] So, I look at like this, man. I feel a little obligated to give back, you know, for whatever reason,
[03:02:36] I am still here with all my fingers and toes. I still can't shoot. I still can't teach. And,
[03:02:40] man, I get down there. I can't help but I'm not the dude on the catwalk. It's not how I teach.
[03:02:46] I put my kid on and go and do CQB with the teams. And I'm like, all right, check it out guys.
[03:02:50] And you're doing that as an act as a guard guard guy. And you, when did you go back in the guard?
[03:02:55] 2012, 2012. Did you go in any deployments once you get 2012?
[03:03:00] I have it, not with them. God, yeah, that's that doesn't take good noff.
[03:03:04] I mean, you know, if you, so I, I weighed out like this, since I've blown to ASD,
[03:03:12] we're not a deploying unit in your, I wear a training detached guard. To go do an eight month
[03:03:19] deployment with SF, the return of an investment just isn't there for me. A, it doesn't pay well enough.
[03:03:25] It's too long, whereas I can do stuff, you know, with the agency and projects and stuff like that,
[03:03:32] that are shorter. And we actually get to do so you still been contracting the whole time.
[03:03:37] Did you go to Syria? Who you with over there with your contractor?
[03:03:41] Yeah. What was that like? I mean, it's cool because like I said, where,
[03:03:51] that would be the wrong, I was going to say, oh, these are different. The RREs aren't different. We have
[03:03:55] a much more efficient training command. I don't have to ask for permission to, you know,
[03:04:02] take a potty break, whereas, you know, teams typically to move from here to here have to ask for
[03:04:09] mission. We are given a mission where allowed to go execute. We send up set reps. We don't have to ask for
[03:04:14] permission. Most of the time, you know, we always have our market. There's some two in my eyes because
[03:04:18] the time. Yeah, you know, it's not for free for all, but we get a mission and we go do it.
[03:04:22] A lot of our stuff is, you know, the ASO type stuff, the source operations, and then
[03:04:31] FO, you know, doing the reconnaissance, and especially with the layout of the ground, as far as
[03:04:37] a local population, and a lot of permissie type stuff. You told me not to do that. Here I am with an
[03:04:43] acronym, right? Freakin' three Cs like that area study of all the equations that make up a
[03:04:52] an area whether it's, you know, population, resources, and all that sort of thing, not just like
[03:04:58] combatants, right? The entire area. What's going on in this area? So we do a lot of that.
[03:05:04] And of course, we can, you know, action targets if we need to typically, like in Syria,
[03:05:09] since we were working in such small elements that, you know, it was like, hey,
[03:05:14] got any rangers not doing anything tonight, you know? You know, we got, there's an ODA around here
[03:05:20] that can come to do this, you know, where the seals that. But yeah, man, that type of work is really
[03:05:27] cool. I've done stuff in Haiti, and we've got a lot of things going on that are, I said,
[03:05:33] more, more US interest than national defense. And one definitely leads to the other, right? Like,
[03:05:41] it's important. If you talk to a lot of people, like, oh, we need to withdraw from around the world.
[03:05:46] Well, if we want to continue to be a superpower, we have to continue to influence in a positive way
[03:05:51] around the world. It's a little why Ukraine is so hard to figure out right now.
[03:05:57] Well, my take on the Ukraine is, hey, man, Europe is full of a bunch of really well-powered
[03:06:06] modern nations. It is their AO, right? Yeah, with modern noters, very modern militaries, right? We,
[03:06:14] we help with that. Russia wants Russian land back. The parts of the Ukraine, it really wants. I don't,
[03:06:24] and maybe, maybe Putin, I don't know what Putin is thinking, right? Like, maybe he wants the whole nation.
[03:06:29] But they've shown us since, you know, even, for instance, 14 when they took or they didn't take
[03:06:36] Crimea, right? Crimea allowed themselves to be annexed. There's a big difference.
[03:06:43] The Ukraine, you know, the South and East, they're native Russians, right? And that's again,
[03:06:50] Americans were too stupid to know that there is a different, structural, Russian and Ukrainians.
[03:06:56] They speak two different languages, right? And do they a lot of them speak both, of course.
[03:07:02] You know, it would be no different in, like, the border of Texas. Lots of people spoke, speak both.
[03:07:06] But there is a clear difference between Americans and Mexicans, right? And that's what's happened in here.
[03:07:11] And in Ukraine, they Russia wants it lands back. Does Russia also want to want to
[03:07:16] order port? Well, yeah, Russia's wanted to want to port for decades, a century or more now.
[03:07:22] Probably longer than that since Navy's have been Navy's. They've wanted one more.
[03:07:26] Well, okay, I get it. Are we at a point in our, so we have two things, right? Like, this
[03:07:33] president who is weak, clearly, could stand up to Russia, to all line in the sand and be the
[03:07:39] heroes and Russia doesn't get to invade. Or we can act tough. Russia invades. We look like a
[03:07:45] bunch of pusses. And now we're obligated to fight. That's the wrong answer, man. American,
[03:07:52] boys and girls don't need to go fucking die in the Ukraine. The Ukraine is one of the most corrupt
[03:07:58] nations on this planet. Now, that is partly due to Russia keeping them that way. A corrupt Ukraine can't
[03:08:06] get in the NATO. All right, NATO's not letting them in in their current state. It's just not happening.
[03:08:13] So that's part of it. It's like, oh, we want them in NATO. If we really want them in NATO,
[03:08:17] we let them join NATO three, five, ten years ago. They're not eligible.
[03:08:23] So, I mean, come on, man. We got to, you know, like, there's a difference in messing and
[03:08:30] meddling and getting ourselves into it. And you got to, you know, again, not a conspiracy theorist,
[03:08:35] but what everything is going wrong for this administration, one can't help but to,
[03:08:39] to at least entertain the idea that it's a distraction from all the other crappy mistakes.
[03:08:47] Now, all of a sudden, Biden wants to look strong. Well, there's Biden and there's Putin.
[03:08:54] And I don't think Putin is ready to step back from Biden. I think he's calling his bluff, man.
[03:09:02] And I don't think that Biden has that, hey, let's sit down and hash this out type of freaking
[03:09:06] mentality. Well, unfortunately, in that case, unfortunately, I have a hard time thinking that
[03:09:17] that Biden could carry on a logical conversation and negotiation with Putin. Like, it just doesn't
[03:09:22] seem like that's a feasible thing. I mean, he has a hard time. He has a hard time. He has a hard time
[03:09:30] putting together sentences, right? I mean, putting together legitimate sentences that are prep form.
[03:09:34] Right. That's just really, really, really disturbing, really, really horrible to see.
[03:09:39] Yeah. And you think he's going to go in with freaking KGB agent and be able to carry on a conversation
[03:09:45] and not get manipulated and take an advantage of it's very disturbing. A KGB agent that for the last
[03:09:50] 20 years has not been distracted by some wars in the Middle East. And we have been. He's been
[03:09:56] preparing and preparing for whatever he wants to do while we've been messing about in the Middle East.
[03:10:01] Yeah. And that's, you know, talking earlier about iterative decision making. Here's another bad
[03:10:07] move when you're to leadership position. Is painting yourself into a corner? You know, don't
[03:10:11] paint yourself into a corner. The world changes things change, but things to happen and you don't
[03:10:16] put yourself in a situation where you can't say, hey, well, this is the direction we're going
[03:10:20] now. It's a little bit different than where you were heading, but it's okay. Because I,
[03:10:23] all time was saying, I might go in a different direction. That's okay. And you know what?
[03:10:27] Let's say we have this amazing charismatic badass leader, which we don't, that allows us to
[03:10:34] look like we're letting Russia paint us into a quarter. And then, boom, he's got a whole
[03:10:37] number of plants. That would be cool. But that's not what's happening. That's not what happened.
[03:10:42] Right? Like, that's that old, what's the, everybody likes to quote the whole, um, you know,
[03:10:46] what's the Chinese book? Uh, Sunsir? Yeah, right? Um, always laugh. I'm like,
[03:10:51] whenever somebody wants to, you know, sound like, you know, understand war, they're going to quote
[03:10:55] that guy, you know, feudal Chinese battle and, you know, war theory, okay, cool, but
[03:11:03] great. Some of us have actually participated in war. Thanks for quoting that. But there is a good,
[03:11:08] the whole thing of, you know, the rules, appear weak when you're strong, you know, and
[03:11:12] appear strong when you're weak, right? Like, always give mis signals to your, um, to your enemy
[03:11:17] and adversaries. Yeah, that's not what we're doing. Our adversaries clearly understand that we have
[03:11:24] a very broken leader. I don't even want to say, Lee, week. Um, because I would say that probably
[03:11:31] a Biden as goofball as he has been throughout his career. You know, Biden in the 80s and 90s
[03:11:36] was definitely an intelligent person, right? Um, that guy as a president probably could have been
[03:11:45] decisive. But despite we have today, it's just an, you know, an old broken person. Um, and
[03:11:52] any of that, you know, I talk about term limits. How about a retirement age? That was probably
[03:11:59] government's point. Yeah. I mean, we have 80 plus year olds running our country and I was
[03:12:04] asked people, yeah, would you trust your 85 year old grandma to walk your dog? Right? Like, put that
[03:12:11] into perspective. What would you trust your 85 year old, your 80 year old grandparents with? And I'm
[03:12:17] sure, there are plenty of outliers, right? There are a hundred years old out there that are brilliant
[03:12:22] outliers never prove a rule. Military's retirement has a retirement age. Every industry has a
[03:12:28] retirement age. Our government 65. Why are our, our justices, why are our representatives, why
[03:12:36] are president allowed? What? I mean, it's socially acceptable to have a retirement age on these things.
[03:12:43] You know, and of course, term limits. But it scares me that we are literally at a point right now
[03:12:52] where this, this president, this administration could lead us into a world war. And we're not ready
[03:12:57] for it. I mean, I'm sure, don't give me wrong. I mean, coming, we could take for American soldiers
[03:13:02] that sailors get ready. Yeah. The military's ready for it. The military's ready technically
[03:13:06] to fight, of course. But are we ready to start losing people in Ukraine, which a lot of people
[03:13:12] couldn't even figure out where it is or map that we don't understand. We don't care about that much
[03:13:18] against Russia, who's Russia. So who's ready for that? When you say who's ready,
[03:13:23] I'd say we're ready to fight, of course. But are we ready to go and die? Well, and kill
[03:13:28] bunch of people that we don't know and civilians that are going to die as well. It's like,
[03:13:32] we may want to think through that a little bit. I'm all for helping our allies. Right? That's a
[03:13:37] good thing. We need a strong bunch of allies. But the Ukraine has known for well over a decade.
[03:13:45] Right? That Putin wanted that land back. So my question is, what has the Ukraine, what has
[03:13:51] Ukraine have been told to you? No, it's what's called it, no Ukraine. Do you know why?
[03:13:56] Because Ukraine, I guess it means frontier. And if you say the frontier, which is the Ukraine,
[03:14:04] that's the frontier of Russia. So calling it the frontier, that's that's what I had in her
[03:14:12] class from. Somebody told me like in a comment. I'm social media that it's not the Ukraine.
[03:14:16] It's just Ukraine. Sorry. I don't know that I'm not purposely trying to diminish that nation.
[03:14:24] No intent implied. Yeah, I don't know, Jack, man. It's so frustrating. It's like we have all these
[03:14:32] problems. And again, I'm not the, I'm not the guy that says, hey, we have to completely withdraw from
[03:14:37] the rest of the world. Now we have to be involved. Yeah, that's not the point. The main thing are status.
[03:14:41] But like to just go metal with the Ukraine when they've done very little to prepare themselves
[03:14:46] for this day, which they knew were was coming. They've done nothing to get their allies in Europe
[03:14:53] to help them. They've, you know, like, hey, and again, any of these situations, any of these situations
[03:15:01] around the world, just to say, oh, we're not going to get involved anymore. Anyone anymore. That's not a good move.
[03:15:05] No, that's not a good move. It's a good move to say, well, okay, what's happening? What would make sense?
[03:15:10] Let's try this approach. Let's see what happens with this approach. If this approach works,
[03:15:15] cool, we'll continue doing vesting that approach. If that approach isn't working, we'll say, you know,
[03:15:19] what? We didn't realize that there's a bunch of different, because Ukraine's got all kinds of
[03:15:23] different factions in there. Oh, we didn't realize that. We, we, we, we looked at it a little bit too
[03:15:28] broad, and we thought Ukraine was Ukraine and we was Ukraine against Russia doesn't really look like it's
[03:15:31] that anymore. We're going to stand down, right? Or we're going to back away. Or we're going to really
[03:15:36] support this group that we know is now come to the surface as being the prominent power there.
[03:15:42] Okay? Instead of saying what we're saying right now, like we don't understand what's happening
[03:15:48] fully, and we can't predict the future. So don't don't over index on things that you can't
[03:15:54] predict. Don't do that in anything. Right. Well, and also, let's influence. Clearly, we are still
[03:16:03] a superpower with tons of influence. Even if our European allies don't respect our current leader,
[03:16:11] he still brings to the table and emits a amount of tools that he can use to sway them. Hey,
[03:16:19] look, oh, hey, Britain, you guys don't want to back us up with whatever we want to do. We're
[03:16:24] going to cut such and such off. Oh, hey, Germany. All those things. But because there's Eastern
[03:16:30] Block, man, they all love us. Right? Hey, you know, there there are there are two allies now.
[03:16:35] You've got, you know, the bridge, the French and Germans who are kind of, they've been flipping
[03:16:40] their middle finger up to us quite a bit for the last seniors. Okay, guys, that's your stance.
[03:16:44] Cool. We're going to continue to be friends with Romania and Hungary and Lithuanian Estonia.
[03:16:49] Yeah, we're going to back them up because they're, they're on the line with Russia. You guys,
[03:16:55] screw you guys. Take care of yourselves for a little while, right? Just like Trump wanted to pull
[03:17:01] funding from NATO. Like you guys are going to start funding this. Right. He took a little bit
[03:17:05] hard line with our allies. Like, hey, we're going to treat you guys like adults now. We're going to
[03:17:08] cut some of your funding. You guys are going to start contributing. That's not a horrible approach.
[03:17:13] Right? Accountability. Oh, own it. Right. You guys want NATO. You like NATO. Don't you? Right. You
[03:17:18] guys like that security of having us backing you up from across the pond. Just like we did in
[03:17:25] World War II. Yeah, y'all know. So check it out. Here's some new rules we're going to play by.
[03:17:31] You know, we've been funding this thing. We're going to take a step back. We're going to let you
[03:17:34] guys take the lead for a little while and see how you do with it. Right? There's nothing wrong with that.
[03:17:39] No. And I think Trump was trying to do that. I don't know. You know, um, and you know,
[03:17:45] let's face it. Those leaders in those countries, man, they, they, they led the way. They are the
[03:17:53] Biden's ahead of Biden Europe. And America, I think we lead the way with everything. Like we led the way
[03:17:58] with this crazy group. You left this presidency and all this stuff. No, man, Europe was way ahead of us on
[03:18:04] that stuff. Their leaders, right? I have been crazy liberals for freaking, you know, five, 10 years now.
[03:18:10] They, they definitely got to jump on that force, you know, not that that's a good thing. So until we,
[03:18:16] just take a step back and say, hey, guys, deal with it. I do think, you know, clearly in this case,
[03:18:23] war with Russia, war with China, man. You're talking something that would affect the entire
[03:18:27] world and be so expensive for all parties, right? And here's the reality, doesn't war with us.
[03:18:33] It would destroy his country and have a money for it. Exactly. So, choke him out.
[03:18:38] Oh, that means cutting off that pipeline we told him they could have. Shit, that's going to
[03:18:44] mean we have to freaking admit we were wrong. Sanctions, Russia can't afford and even more so, right?
[03:18:53] Like if the rest of the world distance themselves from Russia stops and Russia's standing there with
[03:19:01] a China that's kind of their ally, but also trying to shut them out of the way at the same time.
[03:19:06] And I ran, that's your friends Putin, the rest of the world's kind of tidy up all's crap.
[03:19:14] And they go back to behaving, right? And ultimately again, root cause, why does Russia want this?
[03:19:22] Why does Russia want it? We just identify that, we can cut them off in the knees.
[03:19:28] It's just so frustrating, man. And again, you know, always step back and say, you know what,
[03:19:32] I don't know everything. I don't, I don't get to peek behind that curtain, right? Like clearly Biden or whoever's
[03:19:39] running our country, Vice President Harris, they know way more than I do. So, I'm always going to give
[03:19:46] any administration a little bit of benefit of a doubt, right? Like, you know, I always, I hate it,
[03:19:52] growing up in military where it's some key leader would be like, well, you just don't understand the
[03:19:56] big picture. And then as I got older, I realized that I don't understand the big picture.
[03:20:01] Yeah, of course, they didn't either, right? Like, that was their way of saying like,
[03:20:05] you know, we don't really know what the hell's going on either. But now in the motor, I do have
[03:20:09] an acceptance that I don't have the big picture. And I never will, right? None of us will ever know
[03:20:16] what the president of the United States knows, right? I think there's no security clearance out there
[03:20:21] to touches what that guy gets to know or that guy, presumably one day. No, so you, as us,
[03:20:28] as the guys who work for that commander, she always has to come sit back and go, okay, they know
[03:20:32] more than us. So, I always try to keep that reserve, you know, like that to keep me from creating
[03:20:40] assumptions and assertions that are realizing that my assumption and my assertions are always
[03:20:46] going to be less informed, right? Yeah, they've got massive intel, that works briefing every day,
[03:20:55] sources all over the world, like they got some information. Right. Still, I like to think
[03:21:01] to take do some good stuff with it. Me too, like, please, God, because right now, man, what we've
[03:21:07] gotten ourselves into is scary. And again, and as you guys have a China, like, you've talked about China,
[03:21:13] what if China makes a move on Taiwan now? Like, they're not sitting over there going, oh, well,
[03:21:17] if Americans leave you in Ukraine, that the withdrawal from Afghanistan is what set this stage,
[03:21:25] right? Like, I don't know anybody except for some staunch left supporters of, I don't even know
[03:21:30] if there's any Biden supporters left, but there are the Democrats, right, who are just never going to
[03:21:36] say that they were wrong for voting for him or that he anything they've done is wrong, right?
[03:21:41] This is how our system works, but the reality is, any objective synthetic thinker knows that this
[03:21:49] all started with our withdrawal from Afghanistan and the weakness that was just, you know,
[03:21:56] sent out across the world worldwide. So what was the, or was there a straw that broke the
[03:22:05] camel's back that made you say, I'm, I'm going to go and run, because I mean, let's face it, here you are,
[03:22:11] how would you say you are? Just turn 46. Just turn 46. You got businesses, you got a cool woman in
[03:22:18] your life, you got a nice place to live or whatever. Yeah. Seems like you could be going into
[03:22:26] actual literal retirement mode. Yeah, like, incentive, enjoying your life,
[03:22:31] warm mode, right? And that's where I was at, and I've been working towards it pretty hard,
[03:22:37] even living in Wilmington drove me insane, stop lights and traffic and, you know, just, I flew in
[03:22:43] yesterday. I'm happy because, you know, Melissa and I bought 62 acres about an hour outside of Wilmington,
[03:22:51] you know, it came with three dockies and chickens and fenced impasters and we turned our dog's loose.
[03:22:58] And I mean, if I want to walk around my yard naked, you know what I mean? It's that type of country,
[03:23:04] you know, it's the same way I grew up. And I think, you know, whether that's genetic or not,
[03:23:09] I've always creved it. I like to be in places where it's just quiet, you know, growing up on the
[03:23:16] coast, you know, the water and then because of a dare, or someone talking smack, I went to die
[03:23:24] school, wound up on a dive team. I wanted to be on the mountain team. I went to Afghanistan and
[03:23:28] fell in love with the mountains because before I've got to stand, I had done some training in Colorado,
[03:23:32] but not really done enough to fall in love with the mountains and the thin air and all that.
[03:23:38] Well, you went to Afghanistan, man, and I was just, man, you know, I remember looking around like
[03:23:42] in Torrebore and stuff and, you know, like, wow, this would be some amazing snowboarding,
[03:23:49] like, what are they doing here? You know, and at the time, I didn't realize that it actually was a
[03:23:55] destination back in the 60s. They're up my stepmother and her friends all went to Kabul in the late 60s,
[03:24:02] the smoke weed. Yeah, my stepmother is she was so funny of my mom, you know, a North Carolina girl,
[03:24:09] country girl, a farm girl, my grandfather was a farmer and my stepmother's from out here. Oh,
[03:24:16] yeah, she was from like, uh, oh, I should say, uh, I forgot her hometown, but um,
[03:24:24] between here in LA. And uh, so she was like, I hippie. A little bit in the 60s turned into
[03:24:29] unless she was traveling to Afghanistan smoking pop music, but not like, uh, not like an anti-government
[03:24:36] hippie, just like a California young girl, you know, whatever. So cool stories, you know, and I had no
[03:24:42] idea that was that part of Afghanistan that it was actually very Western and modern during the 60s.
[03:24:48] You know, Kabul, you look at pictures, you know, the roads are nice. It's clean, people are smiling, you know?
[03:24:55] So anyway, yeah, man, I'm just not into the city, you know, I was these days,
[03:25:00] you put me behind a tractor or a combat and I got to go six mile an hour for 10 miles. No stress.
[03:25:06] I'm not even good at whatever, you know, I don't care. Because living out there I'm rarely in a hurry.
[03:25:12] I have days that I have work to do in clients and guys to shoot with and classes, but
[03:25:16] on my days off, man, I'm my boss, you know, and don't get me wrong. I can be my own kind of a
[03:25:22] pain in my ass, but I'm flexible with my time. So no stress, you know, um, got out of the city,
[03:25:29] everything's awesome. It sucks from the list of because she drives almost an hour every day,
[03:25:33] one way to her pose. But, you know, she's, she's chill. Um, you know, she loves to listen to her podcast
[03:25:40] and all that kind of stuff. And, you know, she's a dentist, so she works four days a week.
[03:25:45] And, um, so Friday she gets to go and do whatever she wants or whatever. So, you know, before we did it,
[03:25:50] you know, it's like, hey, are you sure? Those are our prices cute, man. And I found it by accident.
[03:25:54] It just happened. We driving down that road, took a different route home one day,
[03:25:58] and, uh, solid for self-sign, put off the side road, put up Google Maps. You could kind of see the
[03:26:03] property lines. I was like, oh, call the realtor, man. We closed on it. So, yeah, you know,
[03:26:09] there are days where like my most intelligent conversation is with a couple of donkeys and some
[03:26:15] dogs. I don't even see people. You know, my nearest neighbor, well, my nearest nearest neighbor is
[03:26:22] like some methods that live like, you know, half a mouth through the woods. Um, we basically have
[03:26:26] an agreement that they, um, they set up my business and, you know, I set it up their business
[03:26:31] and their trailer doesn't burn down. Um, you know, how meth cook houses sometimes, you know,
[03:26:36] catch on fire. So we're good. You know, we're good. Every none did all wake up and like,
[03:26:40] you know, I can hear their music playing it like four in the morning or something, but other
[03:26:44] not, they don't mess with me. I don't mess with them. They're just redneck methods. And then the
[03:26:50] other neighbor man is kind of cool. She lives like 1.2 miles away and she's completely deaf.
[03:26:54] So she can't hear the range. Other not. No one lives within two miles of us, you know, so we get out
[03:26:59] there and shoot and shoot and shoot and no one cares. So it's real cool, man. Yeah. So we were playing
[03:27:07] on moving to Idaho. As the costs were going up, we're starting to look at Montana as well,
[03:27:11] because a couple years ago, Montana being really expensive, Idaho was still like, all right?
[03:27:16] And the cool thing about Idaho for me is while the rockies aren't as high there, they don't have
[03:27:20] the same elevation and say Colorado or wherever Idaho is like 60% public land.
[03:27:27] Lots of hunt and access. And I like hunting, but I like being on those mountains, man. You know,
[03:27:35] it's just quiet. Most times it's just me and Melissa. But yeah, man, we found a couple different places
[03:27:43] where we're looking at one place very seriously in Idaho City, just in the USA. And then,
[03:27:49] and then, everything in America started happening. Because man, that's where I was at.
[03:27:53] You know, my business is doing great. I mean, Melissa's a dentist. So like,
[03:27:58] where she read into pollchocks too? Yeah. And for her to do that, it's kind of a big deal.
[03:28:03] Like, you know, clearly like I said, I can pack a backpack and a duffle bag and move.
[03:28:09] You know, it's got some guns out of the safe. Let's go. She clearly, you know, I mean, she's got
[03:28:16] 18 or 19 employees. We're all females.
[03:28:19] They're always fun because they've always got something going on. You know,
[03:28:25] I don't want to call it drama because that would be dismissing it. But the dynamics in that
[03:28:30] office are always fun to listen to. You know, because I have team dynamics stuff. And then I get
[03:28:35] the list and listen about her team dynamics. And it's like, a lot of the same stuff that we would
[03:28:40] do with only with a hint of, you know, the lady stuff. You know, I don't like, wow, I don't
[03:28:47] envy her at all. Because at least like on a TV and in theory, you could always go out back and
[03:28:51] sort it out, you know, at least going there and put the gloves on and sort back shit out, right?
[03:28:56] She doesn't have that option. So yeah, man, um, we were really close to pollinator going on
[03:29:02] moving. And we had talked about it for years. Like, our first date,
[03:29:06] that we claim as our first date, right? We were when she and I met,
[03:29:11] she and her boyfriend had just broke up me in the garage and had just broke up and we were real
[03:29:15] skeptical of each other. We had known each other from the gym and kind of looked at each other
[03:29:20] like, oh, oh, oh, oh, who's that punk? Who's that punk? You know, both very strong personalities.
[03:29:25] She's her own boss, same with me and been a boss for a while now. I don't really,
[03:29:32] and that dynamic was just so interesting as we came together, we kind of kept it quiet that we were
[03:29:36] seeing each other. So our kind of our announcement to all of our friends and you how a gym can be
[03:29:42] everyone's friends from the gym and um, we did a hike across the Bob Marshall Building as out in
[03:29:49] Montana. Very, but it wasn't supposed to be a hike across. It was supposed to be a loop back to
[03:29:55] the car two days, 20 some miles. Well, that night we hit our turnaround point. We woke up in the morning
[03:30:04] and there was smoke everywhere. Largest forest fire ever in the flathead national forest and
[03:30:11] the Bob Marshall was inside the flathead. Oh, now what? So now we are running from a forest fire all
[03:30:19] way across the Bob Marshall. So it was like 70 or so miles and we didn't even have the food for it.
[03:30:25] And right now in the console of my truck or protein bars, they're not mine. They're for her.
[03:30:33] Her favorite protein bars because the last thing anyone wants is from a list that get hunger.
[03:30:37] We angry, she's a hangry woman. So Melissa is half German and half Japanese.
[03:30:46] I live with the access powers. Keeping her fed is a priority. I'm telling you, man.
[03:30:54] And it's not like a gradual dissent. It's everything's cool and now she just wants to tell your
[03:30:59] throat. And you don't know it. Yeah, and you don't even know it's coming. I'm like, I'm blissfully,
[03:31:05] you know, like, you know, I'm not real crazy or angry about my diet anymore. My thing is like,
[03:31:11] I just, you know, I started getting older, started not having abs as much. So I just quit eating
[03:31:15] breakfast as much. Simple. Some people call that intermittent fasting. I call it screw it less calories.
[03:31:22] No fancy diet names here. And no dude, she needs to eat. So we have to keep her fed. But yeah,
[03:31:29] we run out of food running across the bad Marshall. So you're one day in when the force fire hits. And how many?
[03:31:36] What's the total day? Oh, we want to do it in in in two and a half, two and three quarter
[03:31:41] days and 70 some miles. Maybe we had to go across the continent of the vise. Like you got to climb like
[03:31:46] 9,000 feet in like a mile a half. It's like zig zig zig zig. I mean, we're going up the zig zags, right?
[03:31:54] The switch bags. And I remember looking up the trouble go here to here and on the trail right there
[03:32:00] were three or four mil deer and I was looking up at their bellies like right there. But I could
[03:32:05] still almost touch them. It was like this. Anyway, I bless your heart man. On that trip across
[03:32:10] the bottom of Marshall's, she learned how to read a top of Matt. Prick in was running the GPS. She
[03:32:16] never done that stuff. Of course she doesn't. I mean, she had an ice climb, mountain climb,
[03:32:19] hike in all kinds of national forests, her and her buddy from dental school were like a
[03:32:24] ventricly young ladies out. In some cases they tell me stories I'm like, that was dumb and dangerous.
[03:32:29] You could have been one of those missing person stories. And they were like, yeah, probably.
[03:32:34] Well, anyway, just that type of person man. And we had to cost the white river and it's an
[03:32:40] august so it's snowmelt. You know? And man, I made a huge mistake, freaking. So because she's so
[03:32:47] physically fit. But now she's she's 120, maybe 125 pounds at this time. And I'm like, oh, this is
[03:32:54] a good place across this river. I mean, it's rolling. I think need deep to me. That's halfway her
[03:33:00] quads. I got across, dropped my pack and I could see she was struggling. Right? And I'm pretty sure
[03:33:07] footage. I've been in the woods, backpacks, walking steak. She's kind of walking steak. But it's
[03:33:12] got her where it started to leverage her off. And man, I got back out there and you know, the rocks
[03:33:18] under that water slick. And I'm like, get out there, man. And I put my hand on her backpack. She slipped.
[03:33:24] We went in drink. Oh, I was lucky. I got underneath her. And man, it was like that. Hold,
[03:33:30] push her up. Get me some air. Go back under. And man, I got scuffed up. My whole backside, my knees.
[03:33:39] This whole side just beat up. She's got her pack on. So she's pretty protected or whatever.
[03:33:45] And luckily, there's a curve in the river. Because a couple hundred meters on down this way is
[03:33:49] the salmon river. If we had gone in that, go through those little bit of falls. And into that river,
[03:33:53] we would have died. Right? Luckily, a little curve, man. It watched this up on the shore. We kind of
[03:33:59] crawled out, laid there. It's warm in the afternoon, but man, the water was cold. Real cold.
[03:34:04] And like cold enough to wear it. I'm bleeding and scuffed up, but I can't feel it. I don't know who
[03:34:09] I'm going to be sore. This is good. It's up. She rolls over and looks at me. She's like,
[03:34:14] you saved my life. And I was like, yeah, we're going to go with that. He's still busy.
[03:34:20] Because I'd take that river across the mountain, almost killed her. Almost killed that girl, man.
[03:34:25] And I will never, it spooks me even talking about it, right? Freaking in there. And because
[03:34:32] who would have believed afterwards that I chose that river crossing, right? They're like, oh,
[03:34:37] he did that over purpose. He drowned that girl. But no, we were new. And I was like, oh, I'm in love
[03:34:42] with this chicken stuff. And it horrified me that I had made such a stupid decision. Just stupid.
[03:34:50] But we were running from a forest fire, whatever. Freaking haste, all that. I did learn that
[03:34:55] she's not one of us. You know, it's still have to be careful. She's smaller, so on and so forth.
[03:35:01] Anyway, man, we get across there, whatever, Freaking that was like our first date coming out of
[03:35:06] the closet as far as our statement and stuff. And man, it was ever since then, every vacation
[03:35:11] we took was to the mountains. She wants to climb Everest. It clearly puts me in an interesting position
[03:35:19] because I don't give a damn about climbing Everest. But I can't just let my girl go through now.
[03:35:24] I guess I'm going to have to go up there too. Or I just suck it up and say, hey, honey, I'm
[03:35:28] a wait for you in a base camp, Freaking. Hang out with these pieheads. Freaking, I'll talk to you on
[03:35:33] the radio. Are you dead? You're going to keep going, right? Some of that thing. But now, so we
[03:35:38] start climbing the 14ers in Colorado. So we're doing that stuff, man. Just falling in
[03:35:44] the level of the mountains. Point being is we want to move the mountains. Her best friend from
[03:35:47] dental schools in Colorado, or originally, tell me I'm going to Colorado and then it got a little
[03:35:53] California on us. Lots of public hunting land there. One of two states left that you can get over
[03:35:58] the countertags for elk. No big deal. And if you leave Denver, Boulder, right? Go up anywhere.
[03:36:06] Freaking, it's still Dodge trucks with bumpers. You know, it's still diesel pickups and good
[03:36:11] over-anch boys. So I would do Colorado if she wanted. But we kind of figured on, I don't bunch
[03:36:17] of my friends with a dyto, probably bunch of your friends who have dyto, it's like the,
[03:36:22] where everybody's going. It's the last conservative holdout I guess. Well,
[03:36:27] we were that close, man. We were getting ready to pull the trigger on moving. And like I said,
[03:36:32] a big deal for her with her primes. And then everything started happening. The pandemic, the
[03:36:38] weirdness, it got to the point where I was like, wow, one year ago, if you'd asked me how long
[03:36:44] it was going to take first to get right here, how to say 20 years. But somehow, the US got put
[03:36:50] on fast forward to its progressive decline. And every nation has it. My history tells us every
[03:36:57] culture fails. And we have some very distinct parallels to the last greatest culture, right?
[03:37:03] The last greatest city state, Rome, the Roman Empire. You know, she was dead. A nation and
[03:37:14] culture found it on slavery, on the backs of slaves, right? There are many parallels. A nation
[03:37:20] who cared more about entertaining themselves than protecting their borders, right? It's some spooky
[03:37:26] parallels. And I'm like, oh, and then I'm talking to my very good friend, Alario Pantano.
[03:37:34] Alario, if you go ahead, he was the marine in Voluca that shot and killed two terrorist
[03:37:42] dirt bags. And then was charged with their murders. Lieutenant, Type, you know, he, his
[03:37:52] between, he had lost some boys to debut before. So he was an elistic guy, Scott sniper,
[03:37:56] was working on Wall Street. I'm not allowed to happen, doing great for himself and his family,
[03:38:01] smart guy, real smart dude. And not allowed to happen. And he got back in. And then in Voluca,
[03:38:10] man, you know, for killing two very clearly terrorist, right? Member Feluca, get out or fight
[03:38:17] us. Anybody that stays, you're a bad guy. And then we're bad guys. They had weapons in the
[03:38:21] trunks on and so forth. What got weird? You can look at story up, but bottom line, they charged
[03:38:26] it with murder. Two counts of it. And for how many months of his life, he was
[03:38:33] having to fin him stuff against the nation. And he's so much love. They went to war for
[03:38:38] war. Well, Alario ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012. A better bright before than in 2008,
[03:38:44] time frame when I opened my gym. So I watched and as he was running, I was still very apolitical.
[03:38:51] Was it really interested, so on and so forth? The primaries didn't work out for him. They were fighting
[03:38:58] him and another fellow who is now the incumbent, again, David Rouser. They were fighting for that area.
[03:39:03] And what they were really fighting was a 30-some-year Democrat incumbent. Well, between the two of
[03:39:10] them, they did finally outstim and but David Rouser bested Alario in a primary. He just had more
[03:39:17] pool and one, highly populated segment of that district and David came out the winner.
[03:39:26] Since then, Alario, he became the director of Veterans Affairs and stuff for North Carolina,
[03:39:31] Long story short man, just you know, his dedicated life to trying to take care of service members
[03:39:36] and just a great guy. But last Easter day, we're sitting on a tell-get in my truck out of the range
[03:39:42] and we're just chatting. He took a job at Syracuse University and was living up in Syracuse down
[03:39:48] visited and we were just chatting about things, the nation, the state of it, so on and so forth.
[03:39:54] And I was like, hey man, so I was thinking about potentially maybe duty hops off the tell-get
[03:40:05] and he's like, he can get excited. When he gets excited, he's really excited. He's like, yes,
[03:40:10] if there's ever a time, it's 2022, the nation's ready for it, the climate needs you. It's this
[03:40:15] this is, he just got, he didn't even let me finish. He knew what I was going to say and which I
[03:40:20] thought was pretty cool because I don't necessarily think I, you know, broadcast something like that,
[03:40:25] especially something so out of that bill for me that he just had a feeling. And it was funny
[03:40:30] because it's Easter day and he's like, you know what? I was like, well I'm just kicking around.
[03:40:34] I'm not sure he's like, it's Easter day and there's it's clearly God sent me here today to tell
[03:40:40] you that you must absolutely do this and I'm sitting there going. Okay, not really where I thought
[03:40:47] this was going to go but now I'm like, all right, all right, so if he feels this strongly about it
[03:40:53] and he's the first person that I've even mentioned it to, maybe this is something I should look at.
[03:40:58] And at the time I'm still like, I just want to move to Idaho. I just want to go hunting.
[03:41:02] That's what we left alone in my own business. Then I realized at the reason we were at
[03:41:09] because dudes like me have been mining our own damn business while the left has rallied protested,
[03:41:15] organized and executed a subversion campaign that the world liked the world's never seen before.
[03:41:23] A very successful subversion campaign. So fast forward a little bit so that was Easter day.
[03:41:32] Loria puts me in contact with the folks who are now my consultant team and all that. We start
[03:41:36] kind of exploring. All right, let's come up with some courses of action to see if they're viable.
[03:41:40] Let's see if this works. Well, North Carolina in the census picks up an extra an additional
[03:41:46] non-actual, an additional seat. So we had 13 now we're going to have 14.
[03:41:51] Representative, you have a house or representers.
[03:41:55] Yeah, man. So we're like, okay, let's just we're going to have to wait and see because right now
[03:41:59] I live in that same district with the incumbent David Rouser and by all means a pretty square
[03:42:05] way to. He hasn't, hasn't done anything to really upset anybody. He's not a rhino. I wouldn't say he's
[03:42:12] like the champion of all things patriotic America either but what he has then has taken care of his
[03:42:19] district, which is agriculture. I think he's probably going to become the lead on the agriculture committee.
[03:42:27] At least that's what I've heard. Well, so we decided, hey, look, if I'm going to run, I'm going to have
[03:42:35] to wait to see the new districts because challenging rousers probably a losing thing. I'm not doing
[03:42:40] America any good, challenging an opponent that can't be beat. That's not a good strategy, right?
[03:42:46] And you know, especially the guy that's doing what he's supposed to do, represent his
[03:42:50] district. That's right. I am all for challenging Republican incumbents that suck. They need to do.
[03:42:56] Right. And I've said numerous times, reelect no one, reelect no one. But the reality is there
[03:43:02] are still some good dudes up there who need some backup. They need a QRF. Right. So the new
[03:43:11] districts come out and the county I live in and a couple others to include cumboing county
[03:43:18] fed of the Fort Bragg, Hornet County is a little block. It's almost a square, right? The middle
[03:43:23] of North Carolina, mostly roll and I live in it and it's got fit. Oh, for a break. I'm like, oh,
[03:43:29] okay. Now we're making sense and no incumbent. They. All right. Like it's ready made. It's just
[03:43:36] sitting there ready for me to go woo them around for cons. So we announced man and we had already put
[03:43:43] it together. We're ready. We're just waiting on those districts and he was like, okay, this this
[03:43:47] makes sense. Right. I can do this and hopefully go do some be part of positive change. Help correct
[03:43:53] this trajectory. I joke that it's like a 308 trajectory. We're trying to make it like a, you know,
[03:43:59] a 375 in A-Boah trajectory. You know, let's let's let's flatten this curve. Not the pandemic
[03:44:06] curve. I was like flattened this trajectory curve that America has been placed on by crazy socialists.
[03:44:11] So yeah, man, that happened. We said, okay, cool. This makes sense. But you asked like this
[03:44:18] straw that broke the camel's back, man. I'm not usually a super sentimental type person or whatever,
[03:44:24] but that my father passed last summer. We held his memorial service over July the fourth week in
[03:44:31] my niece, my older sister's daughter. I guess that motor sister is a very successful
[03:44:36] pediatric pediatric and her chronologist. My niece has never known what it's like to miss a meal.
[03:44:46] She doesn't know suffering. And in a lot of ways, I'm kind of that guy's like, this next generation
[03:44:51] sucks and these boys need to learn how to change all in their car. We all get into that sometimes
[03:44:57] like, man, this next gen is just weak. But I'm looking at my niece who is this beautiful young lady
[03:45:02] lacrosse player. She's almost six foot tall, stud, pre-can a gear ahead in school, super intelligent.
[03:45:10] All right? Not only was my sister, you know, more aggressive than these, she's a brilliant mind.
[03:45:17] So her son and her daughter got some of this. Anyway, they come to the house. My niece is a
[03:45:24] plan. You know, my sister's in biotech. So she lives in Boston. So my niece is a city kid. So she's
[03:45:32] out on my, you know, property riding the four-wheeler, playing with the dogs, for you can throw them,
[03:45:37] you know, the dummies into the pond for the retriever. And I'm just looking at her.
[03:45:42] And like, she's never known when it's like to not have Wi-Fi. That level of luxury, right?
[03:45:49] Like, that's America. I mean, even the poorest people in America today have it pretty good. Like,
[03:45:53] homeless people in America, you know, have it pretty good. You know, we take care of even our
[03:46:00] poorest. But I'm looking at her. I'm just like, huh, she's never known when it's like,
[03:46:05] like, since she's been able to use a smart phone, they've had Wi-Fi on airplanes.
[03:46:11] And I was like, I don't want it. I don't want her to ever know what it's like, not to live in that type of
[03:46:16] luxury. I don't want her to live in what Western Mosul looked like in 2005, 2006. And then for the whole
[03:46:24] entire net of it, it'd be burned to the ground and crushed in the indigenous folks of
[03:46:29] none of a city to be murdered by ISIS, right? Like, I don't want her to know an America at war with
[03:46:35] itself. And if we keep on this trajectory, that is a potential course. And that scares the shutt of me.
[03:46:42] And I don't know that any of us will be alive to see that type of demise of our culture,
[03:46:46] but she might be. All right, she's 16 years old. And that was a day that I was like,
[03:46:54] all right, let's do it to lie the fourth week in last year. And it wasn't because it was July the
[03:47:00] fourth weekend. It just happened, right? This is kind of a, I guess, a cool story. And I'm not a very
[03:47:05] sentimental type person or whatever, but it was about my knees. It was the weekend that we
[03:47:10] memorialized my father's life. And I was like, okay, eight years is all due that that will put me
[03:47:19] at 55 years old. And then I'll retire. And I was hopefully, if I continue the path that I'm
[03:47:25] when I would maintain physical fitness and at 55, I'll still be fit enough to go,
[03:47:31] whatever, great thing, I'm going to chase around a mountain. But I was like, you know what,
[03:47:36] if not me, then I'm out of place where I can, like I said, I'm able to sit on the shoulder.
[03:47:43] And you know, as well as I do, right? Like overseas, I had different times in my life where I
[03:47:50] wouldn't take a married guy with kids on my team. I would take that young ranger.
[03:47:56] Because I know he wasn't distracted. I built a team there for a while that was just,
[03:48:00] hmm, there were some scary young men. They had no distractions. I have sent men home
[03:48:06] for being on the phone too often, too late, are you with their spouses? Hey, go, go home,
[03:48:11] sort it out. I'll see you in a few weeks. Or bro, hey, man, I understand if you don't want to come back,
[03:48:18] go take care of your family. But you don't get to be here running operations with us,
[03:48:23] while you got that distraction on your, on your mind. So I don't have kids, man. I can go,
[03:48:29] and go to DC and be fully vested, right? While another person like me who might be considering
[03:48:36] around that has two kids, they need to go to a ballet concert or ballet recital, a concert,
[03:48:42] or a band concert, or a soccer game, or a lacrosse game, or football game, or whatever.
[03:48:48] You'll be sitting at your desk. I can get the work. Yeah. You'll be making shit happen.
[03:48:54] The whole desk image just ruined the bro. Can we not put me behind a desk?
[03:49:02] Yeah, you know, I was joking. I was like, I want to make C-span the most watch news in that
[03:49:08] work. I like that one. I want to be tuning in to see you. What in the world has Tony?
[03:49:18] And so this is kind of cool. Right. AOC in that weird bunch that called them the squad.
[03:49:25] Right. Clearly not an infantry squad. So myself, Jake Collins is a seventh grouper who's running
[03:49:33] in Florida. He's an amputee. He's a stud man, a stud of studs. And so he's running down in Florida.
[03:49:39] He's doing really well as well. We were joking that, hey man, if they can have the squad,
[03:49:44] we'll be the JTF. The joint task force. Right. And that's the thing. We're trying really hard
[03:49:50] to take it all of America. That's a caucus. The JTF caucus, the veterans caucus. What if you want to
[03:49:56] call us? But yeah, man, that is how I made that decision. It's like, you know, hey man,
[03:50:02] there is an entire generation of Americans that needs to be taken care of, that needs to be set
[03:50:07] up for success. And I feel like it's my generation, the 40, the 60 year olds right now who have
[03:50:16] fell this last generation and allowed all this to happen because we were just hard working
[03:50:21] conservatives that minded our own damn business. And by money owned damn business, we elected these
[03:50:27] spinalous cowards that went to DC and sold us out time after time again. Coppermise our rights
[03:50:33] away, right. Everybody's hard to say and conservatives haven't conserved a damn thing. Because
[03:50:38] conservatives are good people and they think dealing with the left is a rational thing. The
[03:50:44] problem is the left are not rational people. They only want what they want and are not going to
[03:50:48] compromise. The right just keeps compromise and bit by bit by bit. Every single right that we hold
[03:50:54] dear, they let it go. Peace by peace by peace. And that's all this nation can fall. Right? There's
[03:51:01] clearly no nation on this planet is going to invade us. Right? And get anywhere. You know, the old
[03:51:07] there's a gum behind every blade of grass, right? The Japanese newspaper they weren't hitting this
[03:51:10] mainland, right? China knows they can't say it with Russia. The only way we can fall is if we
[03:51:17] allow it. And we have allowed this country to get where it's at. And when I say we, I mean us, all of
[03:51:23] us good people, it's our fault. I made a post on social a couple weeks ago, week ago when it
[03:51:28] was. And I, I titled it, you know, the biggest problem in America, question one. It's us.
[03:51:38] Right? It's us not being involved. I ask people who's your representatives. What district do you
[03:51:47] live in? Who's your county commissioners? Are you involved in a local GOP? Are you,
[03:51:52] or not, man? We're not. And in the wild, the Democrats are organized, super organized.
[03:52:01] We're not. And that's how we lose. We don't even vote the average voter in a primary.
[03:52:07] When the Republican conservative side, it's 57 years and older. Young, your conservatives are not
[03:52:15] involved. And part of that problem is, there's a lot of young people in this nation generation,
[03:52:19] they, they don't realize that posting comments and things on social media, it's not real action.
[03:52:28] Right? And I'm not even being funny about it. You used to be, you used to be kind of a joke
[03:52:31] that you know, like, okay, you think fighting on internet, it's not like a real fight.
[03:52:36] And that man, it's like they really, they have begun equating same things on internet as if it's
[03:52:44] a real thing that somehow influences, right? Because we use the term influencers, you know,
[03:52:50] I'm influenced in a damn thing. You know, even with a little bit of followers, I have an Instagram,
[03:52:55] I ask people, I beg, I say, I am pleading with you. Please go join your local GOP. How do we
[03:53:00] get involved? I mean, go join your local GOP. How do I do that? Okay, you own your phone,
[03:53:08] and I want you to put Google, or whatever, search is, and you're using these days.
[03:53:12] I want you to type in your county's name and the letters GOP or Republican Party.
[03:53:20] And you will find their website and you will find out that they have monthly meetings.
[03:53:23] And you'll go there and you'll find out that on average there's only 30 people there.
[03:53:28] No one. And they are the conservative, like, bruhs, they want to be involved.
[03:53:34] But they're the ones that will tell you, like in North Carolina, they want 15,000 volunteers
[03:53:41] to watch the polls. They sit at the polls, 15,000 people. And it's not enough. That's a very,
[03:53:49] very low number. They probably need double that because early voting, two and a half weeks.
[03:53:56] Right? Yeah, I have people watch the polls for for our shifts to shift per day.
[03:54:01] Need two people per shift. At least, right?
[03:54:05] Right? The need is there. And you know, always, I was just, this generation, if they want something,
[03:54:14] just like our generation two, if we want something and we want to get and participate in something,
[03:54:18] and it becomes our hobby man. We know everything about it because we YouTube it and we Google it.
[03:54:22] And we, and we, so all right here, everything you want to know, everything known to mankind,
[03:54:27] except for classified information and some of that is all right here. It's in the phone, right?
[03:54:33] So if you want to know how to get involved, man, it's right here. And when you go and you talk to
[03:54:38] those people, those meanings, yeah, man, they're the fanatics. They're the really passionate,
[03:54:42] conservative Republicans who really do want to change that Republican Party, the image of the
[03:54:48] old GOP, the rhinos and all that. If you go to these GOP, means, man, they're mad at the Republican
[03:54:54] party. They're the Republican Party, they're mad at the Republican Party. They want to get rid of the rhinos.
[03:55:00] There's the people who want to renovate that party because I hear people say,
[03:55:07] you know, maybe we need a third party. Okay, that's not a viable course of action.
[03:55:12] The America's not ready for it. It would take the Democrats and the Republicans
[03:55:17] getting together and deciding the third party was a good thing.
[03:55:21] Didn't we either decide to surrender to whatever power they have or not?
[03:55:24] Not going to do. Power is like a matter. It never goes away. It can be transferred.
[03:55:30] And we have transferred willingly, power, throughout our nation's history.
[03:55:36] A good example is when we gave minorities to the right of them.
[03:55:42] So we are capable of doing it. We gave women the right of them.
[03:55:47] So we have transferred power willingly, typically speaking throughout American human history,
[03:55:53] power is transferred because it's taken. It's rarely given that that's what makes America special.
[03:56:00] Is that we have given power willingly in an effort to create this amazing country.
[03:56:10] But yeah, man, freaking, you know, it's going to take us getting involved. The biggest problem
[03:56:17] on this planet is that in America today, that's going to continue to lead us down this path
[03:56:22] and not change this trajectory is us mining our own business.
[03:56:27] And I get it, man, you got a job. You got a couple kids and if you don't get involved,
[03:56:33] right? Because what happens when you go to the GOP and you're
[03:56:38] eight, ten, and fourteen year old. So you get involved. What are they going to grow up to do?
[03:56:45] It's setting the example, right? Set the example. They seed the standards. All that military
[03:56:49] leadership talk. It's not bullshit. No, you know it's not bullshit. We're an entire book about it.
[03:56:55] A couple of them, right? You know, setting the example for your children is not just making
[03:57:02] sure they're taking care of, right? We've got to get involved and if we don't, man.
[03:57:10] Like I said, our adversary, they're very involved. They're organized and they're scary.
[03:57:15] I asked people I'm like name one thing. The left has wanted in the last six years they
[03:57:22] have been gotten. One is complete reversal of the segment. Why? Because there's a bunch of people out there
[03:57:32] with guns that ain't going to let it happen. Other than that, every niche special interest they've
[03:57:39] ever wanted, they've gotten it. And now it's like they're just bored looking for shit. You know what I mean?
[03:57:43] Like the transgender is free-gid in college sports. Like, all right. We're just going to make up some
[03:57:49] stuff that actually goes against our whole feminist movement. And like it's like they're bored.
[03:57:53] Like we got everything we want. What else can we take from them? And but they're going to continue
[03:57:58] to take because whether or not most laughs truly won't communism, there are enough folks out there
[03:58:05] that do that believe that communism is the right path. Well, the rest of them will follow.
[03:58:12] Because they actually have leaders. Right? You mean you're telling Hillary Clinton is not an effective
[03:58:17] leader? I'm not saying she's a good leader. I'm saying she's an effective leader, right? Like
[03:58:22] Putin is an effective leader. He's not a good person. She's definitely not a good person. She's
[03:58:28] effective. They want things Hillary Clinton hadn't gotten that she wanted presidency. And I don't
[03:58:34] know that she's done yet. It's scary shit. What we're fighting that one out soon. I'm hopefully
[03:58:44] I got a factory down in Ashboro, North Carolina. I think it's a sixth district. Hopefully at some
[03:58:50] point when I cut down there in the next several months we can link up definitely. And hang out.
[03:58:55] You got to come check out the factory for sure. I haven't been there yet, but actually we have
[03:58:59] two factories. We're consolidating in the process of consolidating right now, but
[03:59:02] hundreds of jobs, hardworking people, funny thing. Man, that district, I think, because we've
[03:59:10] had so many changes, that is probably the district that Christian Castanelli is going to run in.
[03:59:15] He's one of those eight T.B. Lieutenant Colonel Types, seventh grouper. He now chat quite a bit.
[03:59:22] And it's going to be a real tough race for him as well. He had more counting. And now they redistrict
[03:59:28] again. And I could say that it could redistrict another time. It's going to do a course this week.
[03:59:34] It's frustrating. And it's easy to do. So you know right now which you wear your running
[03:59:40] for right now. Okay, but it could change. So yeah, was that new fourth which was Samson County
[03:59:46] Johnson County, a little bit of Wayne County, Hornet County and Cumballon County. And now it's the new
[03:59:51] new 13th. And that's Duplan County, Samson County, Johnson County, a little bit of Wayne County
[03:59:57] and Southern Wake County. And it's so weird because these new districts, they don't hold communities
[04:00:03] together. And it was like again, it was the Republicans were trying to make the dims happening.
[04:00:08] Get some stuff pushed through that would actually work. Meet all the numbers because the districts
[04:00:12] have to have equal numbers. Right. And to do that, you know, you've got to get a city in here and
[04:00:21] a part of a city over there. And it's not like it's like, okay, just pick this region. You know,
[04:00:26] it's more complex than that. So this new district again,
[04:00:32] art man. And like I said, this goes back to Republicans trying to make the Democrats happy.
[04:00:37] The Democrats suck at them again. So we have an activist, very left-laning Supreme Court in North Carolina.
[04:00:46] And so when these new districts, the Democrats challenged them. It went to Supreme Court.
[04:00:50] They booted them. They had to rewrite them. So they rebuilt them. The house did a set. And I like
[04:00:55] that map pretty good. This new one. I don't dislike it. It's just not my favorite because I
[04:00:59] lost Comberland County. I want to represent Fayetteville for a drag. It's kind of personal.
[04:01:08] So the this week, they have to go to a three panel, court, three judge panel in the court. And that's
[04:01:19] two conservatives one level. It will get the thumbs up there. Most likely, the Democrats will
[04:01:25] challenge it again. But the Shastee, like sinister part, is when they were building these maps.
[04:01:31] It was by parison in the Senate and in the house. Both parties working together. They created
[04:01:36] this map. Dems gave them a thumb up. It went to vote. Dems all voted against it.
[04:01:40] Suckers now what? Because it's divided half and half. And one Republican voted with the Democrats.
[04:01:50] That sets the precedent for it to go to the court and then toss it out. They can be like,
[04:01:54] look, y'all don't even agree on it. It's clearly by parison. This is supposed to be or it's clearly
[04:01:59] partisan. They set them up again. And it's like, you guys are bending over backwards. When you
[04:02:06] use it on a draw the line in the sand. They could draw the line in the sand and take it to the
[04:02:09] US or US Supreme Court. That's expensive. And it takes a fight. And time. That's a time. And they're
[04:02:18] worried about the time because we've already pushed our primaries back from March to May.
[04:02:22] They're probably going to get pushed back to June now. That's getting closer and closer to the general
[04:02:26] election in November. They could in theory move that. Right. That, you know, that November election
[04:02:32] day does not a hard set day. The state can choose a different day. They can push it to January.
[04:02:37] But that cuts off the whole next cycle. That pushes into the next cycle. What do you do now?
[04:02:44] And it were in such an uncharted territory. And I just don't have faith that the Republicans
[04:02:49] right now know how to deal with this fight. And the Democrats, almost like I said, it's almost
[04:02:55] like they're just trying to see what they can get away with. But they're panicking. The Democrats know
[04:03:02] right what's coming in this midterms. So these new, our new districts, they are so close to any
[04:03:10] other year. They would most of them be 50, 50 splits. They could go either way. They'll be swing
[04:03:15] districts. But because of this anticipated red wave, they set them up. It looks more like they set
[04:03:22] them up on purpose to be Republican. Very much favored Republicans. And they will certainly.
[04:03:29] But the North Carolina Constitution says it is the role duty responsibility of the general assembly
[04:03:36] to set the districts. So of course it's going to be partisan. Right? Because rarely, if ever,
[04:03:43] is your house and Senate 50 50, right? It just doesn't happen. So there's a whole constitutional
[04:03:50] battle here in state constitution. And I think people really understand how important your state
[04:03:56] constitution is. Right? Like when our government was set up, it was supposed to be all these
[04:04:01] states, these nations of the United States. And we've gotten away from that. The federal government
[04:04:08] is gotten too big. And that's one of my big things. Like, hey, let's return that federal government
[04:04:13] let's put it back in its constitutionally limited box and put the lid back on it. Because that
[04:04:19] monster has climbed out of that box and gone all over the place. And I would say like, Heck, man,
[04:04:25] if you could simply attempt, let's say we got a 70% solution on getting our federal government
[04:04:30] back to its Constitutional limitations. We would solve over half of America's problems with the federal
[04:04:38] government. Just return it to what that Constitution says. I don't know, man. I just feel like two
[04:04:43] often folks up in DC, they use the Constitution to a paper instead of reading it for exactly
[04:04:50] what it stated. It's it's hardbreak. And then, well, like you said, it's going to be a battle.
[04:04:59] It is a battle. I know you mentioned about how what to do for people to get to help out,
[04:05:06] you know, locally, where that out, how can people, I think that's probably a pretty good place to
[04:05:10] wrap up because we've been going for over four hours. But if people want to support you,
[04:05:17] we got Tony Cowdon dot com, right? And that's the main that is the campaign website.
[04:05:22] So campaign website, you're on Instagram. You just said Tony underscore,
[04:05:27] Cowdon underscore, four, a letter for or it's getting the number four. Is that a letter for?
[04:05:32] No, the number four in C and then I have two Facebook pages, my personal Tony Cowdon and
[04:05:39] the campaign Tony Cowdon. They're both me. All right. And then you've got a YouTube channel,
[04:05:48] which I saw. Yeah, I don't you much with it. I was going to say you have one video. But you know,
[04:05:53] I had it. I want to I ever know. We can only go Tony Cowdon gets after it. So I don't know. Maybe
[04:05:58] tonight you're going to post for 87 videos on you. YouTube's just never been my favorite for
[04:06:03] whatever reason. And I've had numerous YouTube channels, right? I've got the one right now. Like you
[04:06:08] say, I was got a couple videos, maybe on it. And then like, but you know, YouTube was a big thing
[04:06:11] that had to jam had lots of videos on it. And just something happened where with the whole shooting
[04:06:16] gun thing, Instagram became my main platform. And as much as I don't really like social,
[04:06:24] I don't like the whole idea of it. I mean, I'd much rather go back to just, you know, but
[04:06:28] it seemed that at least the evolution of it all. I know if it was even by design, the Instagram page
[04:06:34] was what grew and funneled me business. Whereas it was when I had the gym, Facebook,
[04:06:40] it was because Facebook so local. So now I'm having to get back after Facebook because the campaign
[04:06:45] is very local. But yeah, man, the reality is and this sucks, man, because I spent my entire life
[04:06:51] been pretty independent, I've never had to ask anybody from money. And it's weird. The reality
[04:06:57] of this whole mass and it is a mass because there needs to be campaign finance reform. The reality
[04:07:03] is if the campaign is not funded, I don't get to advertise and there's no face or there's no
[04:07:08] recognition, there's a name face recognition and I won't get the votes. And you know, strategically
[04:07:14] speaking, you know, we're addressing, you know, fundraising, talking to donors and then there are
[04:07:20] voters. And they're not always the same people. We've done really well so far the soft,
[04:07:25] bro net just like you have a meal on here. Been on a bunch of different other guys and when I
[04:07:32] launched that soft network man just started sharing it. And we raised a 132 grand and like 13 days
[04:07:40] of our Christmas. And that's what got people going, what way, who's this dude? Where's this guy
[04:07:47] coming from? And you know, there's always this, there's some contention that, oh, you're not getting
[04:07:53] your funds from the district. Well, I don't know what the district is. You know how hard it is to get
[04:07:58] someone to donate to your campaign, when they don't even know if you live in their district or not,
[04:08:03] you think the Democrats don't know that. Of course they do, right? What they're doing is creating
[04:08:08] better apathy or something or whatever. So they won't donate and they're not going to devote. It's
[04:08:15] a strategy. It's not new. It's done it before. So yeah, man, this is where, you know, that's the asking
[04:08:22] for money thing is hard. But here's the cool part. That $132,000, the number one donated amount was
[04:08:32] $50. We had $161,500 individual donors from across the nation, all 50 states, over Christmas.
[04:08:42] When people don't have extra income because they're spending on their Christmas presents,
[04:08:47] donated this campaign. That's a clear signal. It should be a clear signal to folks up in DC and everywhere
[04:08:54] else that the American public is tired of their shit. Excuse me, my language, but that's what it is.
[04:09:00] And they want normal people, and if I follow that kind of way, that's what it is. They want real
[04:09:07] people who have never sought out politics. You know, before we got on, I was checking and telling
[04:09:14] you about my opponent, who's a state house rep and they call him the alcohol of
[04:09:23] no killing politics because he sold out and those kind of taxpayers and sent tax dollars all around
[04:09:27] the nation to invest in green energy and so on and so forth. Long story short, he didn't like it.
[04:09:35] I think I might have been with Andy Stomp when I referred to him as the alcoholist.
[04:09:39] No killing politics. Well, reality is that's what they call him. He's a
[04:09:43] no killing a member of no killing a house and all of his contemporaries. They all calling that.
[04:09:48] Right? He didn't like it. Well, the other day charged up to me and it was like,
[04:09:54] you know, and ultimately I was like, hey, look man, you know, you say whatever you want,
[04:10:00] but you set that money out and he told me, he told me I was an ignorant wannabe.
[04:10:08] And I was like, like I said, I might be ignorant to how and why y'all do things.
[04:10:15] There's dirty ass politicians. I was like, but I'm not a wannabe. Like you created me.
[04:10:21] Men like you are the reason why men like me are coming for your jobs.
[04:10:29] We hired you. You suck. So now we're gonna fire you. And that's about America wants right now.
[04:10:35] All right. Let's clear America wants. And like I said, man, we get that JTF up there.
[04:10:42] So yeah, 10 bucks. Right. 100 bucks. I mean, if you got 2900, that is the max contribution.
[04:10:50] I could stand some of those because that new district's more expensive. But Southern Wake County
[04:10:56] Raleigh, that advertising is, that's way more expensive. That market, right? A TV ad in Raleigh is
[04:11:04] expensive. But that's what I need. I need funding. People ask, what can I do? 10 bucks. Right?
[04:11:12] Don't get your Starbucks coffee today. Give me five bucks. And it's weird man asking for people
[04:11:17] from money. And then I came to the conclusion, I'm not asking people to give me money. This is an
[04:11:22] investment in America's future. Because I promise people I will not become a politician.
[04:11:29] I would rather die than sell this nation as people out. And I put myself in that position before
[04:11:36] that I would have died and almost did a couple times. I feel like I have that proven try record
[04:11:41] and people are like, but there's this guy and there's this guy, he's this veteran and that
[04:11:45] veteran. They went up there and they sold us out. I'm like, I'm not those guys. I'm not those guys.
[04:11:51] What do you want? Here I am stepping up, help me get there. And if I turn out to be some
[04:11:58] Spinalist dirt bad politician, fire me. I get involved and fire me. But I promise,
[04:12:07] I'm not capable of being a dirt bad politician. It's not in my genetics. You know, it's not
[04:12:13] even close to something I could ever be. You know, corporations don't have things that I want.
[04:12:19] I'm not a gear guy, right? Corporations don't have things. I don't want a boat. I don't want a boat.
[04:12:25] I don't want, I don't desire money. I desire experiences. That's why I like hunting. And, you know,
[04:12:32] with my girlfriend, you can't sell me that. I'm not, I'm not for sale. So, yeah, man, if you got
[04:12:39] a few books, Tonycombe.com, oh, I will tell you this, man. When the cool things is, when you
[04:12:43] go to the website, when it pops up, there is a pop up that has a video and stuff. You can watch it.
[04:12:50] It's cool videos. Let me tell you how cool I am or some shit. Just move past that. I don't understand
[04:12:55] it says dirt bike price. I'm not a something from nothing type of guy. So, last year, I got this
[04:13:01] here at my house that I was going to get back in the race of motorcross. So, I went and bought a brand
[04:13:06] new KX4F50 rocking ship. I got an excavator and a, uh, and 63 acres. And I built a motorcross track in my backyard.
[04:13:19] All that my girlfriend going, what is wrong with you? And, uh, that dirt bike,
[04:13:25] spin, I got it last November. So, it's been whatever year in a few months. It still has the second
[04:13:30] take a gas in it. I have a head time to ride it. So, you're going up for auction? I donated it to the
[04:13:36] campaign. So, it's a raffle. It's a raffle. It's, you know, a $10,000 dirt bike. It's never been laid over.
[04:13:43] I was cautious getting back into riding. So, I took it easy. Boots, helmet, nice stuff. I didn't
[04:13:50] bullshit about some nice stuff. Four or five sets of riding gear, Oakley goggles, all that stuff.
[04:13:55] Even by chances at it. I'm not a something for nothing type of guy. I got an AR coming on board
[04:14:00] and a precision rifle, a custom precision rifle at my buddy who makes my precision guns freaking
[04:14:06] building for us. So, point being is right, I'm not a something for nothing type of guy. So, if you
[04:14:11] donate it, it can't pay at least you're getting a chance to win some cool stuff. So, hell yeah.
[04:14:18] All right. So, echo you got anything? No, we covered it.
[04:14:25] Awesome, man. Oh, yeah. Thanks for coming on, bro. No, thank you for having me. Thanks for sharing
[04:14:30] your experiences. Thanks for what you've done for America in the past. Yeah. And thanks for what you
[04:14:37] are about to do for America. Awesome to meet you, man. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for having
[04:14:43] me. This is this how we win. Absolutely. Hell yeah. Thanks, brother. Thank you.
[04:14:49] And with that Tony Cowden has left the building head and back to North Kacklecki. And I failed
[04:14:58] to mention, I failed to make North Kacklecki. I failed to make it look I mentioned the fact that
[04:15:04] we at origin USA have a factory in Ashboro, North Carolina, which is awesome. But I failed to
[04:15:10] mention. And it just like these conversations you don't know where they're going. I failed to
[04:15:14] mention the fact that when I went through Buds and STT, seal tactical training and then got the
[04:15:23] seal team one. And then I did three deployments. And then I was in training cell with my running
[04:15:31] mate at the time, who I also he was my roommate that whole time. And he was from North Kacklecki.
[04:15:41] And he's a freaking best guy. Awesome guy. And a total stud across the board, but he's super
[04:15:49] good athlete, like a ridiculously good athlete. Like we had he played, this is the guy who played
[04:15:57] basketball in North Carolina as a kid. And then he got drafted. He was 511. He missed a foul shot.
[04:16:10] And lost like the state championship. He did that. You know. So he had he had that, but you know
[04:16:16] he was still. He was in the state championship and he's obviously a key player. And he got he got
[04:16:22] some he got drafted or whatever recruited to some D2D3 schools. Because he was such a good basketball
[04:16:28] player. And he ended up he's like, listen, I'm not going to I'm not going to be a pro obviously. So
[04:16:34] I'm going to focus on my education. So he ended up going to University of North Carolina. And while
[04:16:39] he was there, he grew 5 inches. So he graduated at 6-4. And this is a guy you know you go out
[04:16:47] and shoot basketball with them. And he would just sit there and hit 3 pointers all day. So then then
[04:16:54] we had all the grizzard who was the navy quarterback. And who's himself a stud. That's the guy
[04:17:01] who's a great friend of mine and he ended up getting murdered in Coronado, which was awful.
[04:17:06] But just a stud. Just a stud across the board. I mean he played. He broke all kinds of records at
[04:17:12] the Naval Academy. Just a beast. And those two guys got in a little throwing contest. Who could
[04:17:18] throw a football further? And my buddy from North Kaka-Laki also played football. So I'm sitting
[04:17:26] and watching because I'm not even going to participate in this competition against these two
[04:17:29] freaking studs. And so they started throwing it back and forth just backing up each time.
[04:17:37] Right. And yeah the kid from North Carolina. He threw it further. It was like 65 yards. So
[04:17:45] you know I'm talking a wing. And just a beast man. But so whenever I hear North Carolina, I always think
[04:17:52] North Kaka-Laki because that's how he had this funny look. He'd give people, you mean everybody.
[04:17:59] But when you said North Carolina, if you said North Kaka-Laki, he'd give you look like of the most
[04:18:03] affirming of it. You know like like that's everything. You know like you know as if you just said
[04:18:11] you know chocolate peanut butter milk like that's so good. You know that's what it goes things.
[04:18:17] So they get very cool to talk to Tony. And you know what's a scrap man? It's a scrap.
[04:18:26] He's got to go. He's going hard in the paint you know. He's going hard in the paint.
[04:18:33] He said something that was that was interesting and maybe I don't know. I don't follow
[04:18:39] public politics as much as maybe others do. But he did mention something that I thought. That's
[04:18:46] that's good. This is a good thing to be talking about and to be thinking about is the lack of effectiveness
[04:18:53] of a linear solution. Because man that linear solution like and that just in everyday club
[04:18:58] bra I don't know how to write a country. Everyone knows that. You know that about me. I don't know how to
[04:19:03] but I do think that it's going to be difficult to make decisions for what 300 million people or
[04:19:12] whatever. You know what's in the best interest for three. It's that's hard. I understand. But if you
[04:19:17] kind of simply down on whatever let's say I don't know for example your kids. Right?
[04:19:21] If you start implementing linear solutions with your kids so the kids, no, no, no, crying. They want
[04:19:27] a soda. So to pop. Give them the soda. That's the lead solution. Yeah, they're crying. They're
[04:19:33] unhappy obviously because they're crying and whatever. What's the linear solution exactly?
[04:19:38] They're right. Give them the soda. But that causes all kinds of other problems. A lot of them too
[04:19:42] by the way. Not just one another problem. It's like a bunch of other problems. So to imagine it be
[04:19:48] that same formula except times a million with running the country and whatever way. So it's like,
[04:19:55] yeah, to focus on that concept where it's like, okay, sure this will be a linear solution or understanding,
[04:20:00] okay, that's a solution. That's a linear solution. Understand what would happen then and he kept saying,
[04:20:05] and then what? Right? Just to be paying attention to that stuff, I think that's a good thing. They're
[04:20:10] good move. And I'm not saying no one else pays attention to that but that's not like any kind of front
[04:20:14] running concept that people are kind of pushing. You know, doesn't seem like it is. Yeah.
[04:20:19] And I don't know, but I liked it. Well, if you can lend some support to Tony, this look,
[04:20:25] you might not agree with them on every topic that there is. Maybe you see some things a little bit
[04:20:31] differently than you. But the guy's character and just the fact that he's going to go up there and
[04:20:39] live in his room and make things happen. Help him out if you can. If you want to help out yourself,
[04:20:50] a little bit too speaking of origin, USA, we have a factory in North Carolina,
[04:20:56] kind of two factories right now, which we're consolidating. We have factories up in Maine,
[04:20:59] we're build stuff in America. Look, here's something else you can do to support America.
[04:21:03] You want to help America by American, by American. You need a pair of boots,
[04:21:09] by American, because you need a pair of jeans, by American pair of jeans.
[04:21:13] But have you ever heard of Jake Tran? Okay. So maybe I maybe have he, what he does is he kind of breaks
[04:21:19] down things that have to do with like money and power and he makes these cool YouTube videos.
[04:21:24] Okay. New Jake Tran. So, one of them, one of his recent ones were fashion, like the evil fashion
[04:21:32] industry. And that's what he was talking to be talk about like how basically fashion is built by slavery,
[04:21:39] you know, their countries. Oh, for sure. So if you've not been listening to me for the past
[04:21:43] freaking years, I have and mainly just what he had here from Jake Tran.
[04:21:48] But Jake Tran, the way he breaks up, he did it better than me. I got it. I love you.
[04:21:53] You were the man. But in this one, he did a really, really good job. Well,
[04:21:58] maybe if I had someone that I worked with that could put together videos that kind of extended
[04:22:02] the things that I were saying, maybe that would have worked out better. I don't know. You know what?
[04:22:06] You make a good point. You make a good point. It's my fault for not finding someone that was
[04:22:10] more effective than me in social media and media arts. Again, great point. But the way he does it,
[04:22:17] is he does it in terms of like, like, you're the evil one and he's talking to you goes,
[04:22:22] all you have to do is just get some slaves and like he'll talk to, that's how he'll make it.
[04:22:26] It's not just easy to do that all the time. That's it. Yeah. It's kind of sarcastic, but kind of like,
[04:22:33] when he'll come and act you a little bit, yeah, he's coming at your sinister side almost. Like in
[04:22:39] certain ones, it's more heavy than others, but then he'll be like, what's the heaviest one?
[04:22:45] This one was so heavy, it made me consider actually doing it. But at the end of the day, when
[04:22:51] you stop the YouTube video, you're like, probably I'm not going to do that. You know, anyway,
[04:22:53] want about charities, like how charities can defraud the government or something like that.
[04:22:59] And we'll like, oh, he'll say, you can do this and this with no strings attached, of course,
[04:23:03] and then he'll keep talking and you're like, see what he did there. So you're going to start
[04:23:07] a charity to defraud the government. Is that what you were saying? You don't want to do it?
[04:23:12] It's not what it's about, but I'm saying what you watch the video, you're like,
[04:23:16] that's actually not a bad idea. You know, it's like that kind of thoughts, but it's the way he says it,
[04:23:21] though. I'm going to do one YouTube video away from being sinister and ripping people off.
[04:23:25] Yeah, this worked to it, but anyway, what's that one about the freaking fashion industry? You're
[04:23:32] going to be like, probably, yeah, that's it. And I get what you're saying when you're like,
[04:23:36] that's what you've been saying. That's what's up. I've been saying it,
[04:23:38] effectively enough for you to understand it, apparently. No, no, I understand it, but he like,
[04:23:43] it's about a job. Okay, I'm going to watch him. We'll get the message right. I'll get the
[04:23:48] message right. So people that we'll understand that when you buy some fashion crop that's made
[04:23:55] overseas, it was made by slaves. That's what's happening. You remember that one building in
[04:24:01] I forget where it was, but where it collapsed on all the, all the workers. So he starts off like
[04:24:05] with that and like just all these, yeah, it's crazy. And then a lot of it, it's all essentially like
[04:24:11] borderline free stuff. Like this. As far as how it was made. Yeah. So so much of it just goes to the
[04:24:17] trash so much of it. So they're just, yeah, who cares, kids? Whatever. That's why you see some of
[04:24:23] those, those, those high-fashion companies will take their surplus and just burn it,
[04:24:28] because they want to keep the supply low. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they misread the next fall season.
[04:24:36] Or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. And so they got to burn it. So let's not support that. Let's support
[04:24:42] freedom. Yeah. Let's support America. Let's support origin USA, origin USA dot com. Also,
[04:24:51] you get yourself some jockel fuel. I mean, let's face it. You're going to have some,
[04:24:57] you know, whatever. Injuries, soreness. Soreness. Yeah. For sure. What's the between muscle
[04:25:04] soreness and like when you have a joint soreness? Well, do what do you call it when you're,
[04:25:08] if you did, let's say you did weighted dip sister day? Sure. I put that in. See, weighted dips
[04:25:13] every time I do weighted dips. I feel like a little bit of not just sorness in my triceps and chest,
[04:25:20] but I have a little bit of what is that called in my shoulders themselves? Yeah. Like joint pain.
[04:25:26] Yeah. Like a little bit, but it's minor. Right. Right. I joined agrofession. Yeah. It's like I think a
[04:25:30] lot of the times they don't come obviously from like certain nutritional elements. And
[04:25:35] could be past injuries as well. But a lot of them, it's imbalances in certain places.
[04:25:43] You know, so you kind of overstretch understretch certain things and whatever. But when you have
[04:25:49] joint agrovation, sure, you can take like during orifer. If you have muscle soreness,
[04:25:54] you can take milk. Yep. And these are nutritional elements that can improve that are going
[04:25:58] to improve these. That are going to improve these. That are those. Unfortunate scenarios.
[04:26:00] And kind of fortunate because at least you were able to do them. Exactly. You were able to get
[04:26:04] after it. And it's part of the game. So I learned early on and I was okay. So I make my daughter
[04:26:09] do little workouts. Sometimes it's punishment. Sometimes it's just what we're doing. And she's eight.
[04:26:15] So Dom's delayed onset muscle sort of is new to her. So when you're new to Dom's, you're like,
[04:26:21] I don't like this feeling. Like why would I do push-ups or why would I do a bunch of squats when
[04:26:25] my legs are going to feel like this the next day? It's like you feel like your body's kind of
[04:26:29] being destroyed or whatever. But when you really understand what Dom's is, you kind of invite it.
[04:26:34] So I understood the value of Dom's early on. I think I was like 10 or 11 years old.
[04:26:40] From reading about it or just understanding that, I want how yesterday I'm sore because I'm
[04:26:44] getting straw or, yes. So I found out I forget how I found out this is, you know, whatever,
[04:26:50] 1980, 80, whatever, however old or whatever year. But I knew that your muscles were sore because they were
[04:26:57] triggered into like growing back big or whatever. So I'm like, oh shoot. So if I do a bunch of push-ups
[04:27:04] and I'm not sore, I'm like dang, I didn't do enough push-ups. Or if I ran a bunch, like when I
[04:27:07] started, when you, you know the first two days of football practice, you get sore, like your
[04:27:11] sore, your legs are sore, your abs are sore from doing sit-ups, your next are all this stuff.
[04:27:15] But I knew that, no, that's because they're about to grow back bigger. You kind of invite it.
[04:27:20] So now as an adult I understand, hey man, that Dom's life is part of the part of the thing
[04:27:24] payment. Yeah, I can say. But you can mitigate it, you can mitigate it. Not by working out the last,
[04:27:29] so working out weaker. Oh no, no, no, no, no. But eating the correct food. Yeah, you're facilitating
[04:27:34] the whole Dom's process right there. So all that stuff, jockelfuel.com plus you can get the drinks out
[04:27:42] wall-aw-aw. Which by the way, we're kind of dominating a wall-aw. If you go out and you buy stuff from
[04:27:46] wall-aw-aw, I am personally thinking you at this time for making us dominate wall-aw. Don't let
[04:27:52] up. Clear shelves going there, get an after it. We're working with a bunch of other companies. We are,
[04:27:57] I got to put together a list of where you can buy jockelfuel. But right now, I can tell you,
[04:28:04] you can get it out wall-aw-aw, the drinks and you can get it at the vitamin shop. So, or you can
[04:28:09] get it at jockelfuel.com. Yeah, we drink kombucha. I don't like it. Me neither. And that's kind of the
[04:28:15] thing where you know like, you know, drinks kombucha, all the females in my family. Yeah,
[04:28:21] drinking that stuff like, it's method, fed of me or something. It would teach their own,
[04:28:26] not during the method, fed of me, but like it's a very big, like something that they're enjoying. You're
[04:28:30] here good thing. Yeah. Okay. No hype it up. Anyways, let me retract that. My wife and daughters
[04:28:38] like kombucha for whatever reason. Yes. I think it tastes like crap. Like crap, yes, sir. And I'm not
[04:28:44] even a guy. My father-in-law, he makes his own kombucha. Oh, yeah. So it was like, dang, okay,
[04:28:48] obviously great for you. Good enough for you. There was a dude that made kombucha with jockel
[04:28:53] white tea, by the way. Oh, okay. He was selling it. Combat kombucha. I don't know what happened to it.
[04:28:58] He went out there's making combat kombucha kombucha kombucha.
[04:29:01] That's all, that's all. That's all the deal. All right. Are you going to say it? Either way,
[04:29:05] the point of, okay, do you have any vegetables that you just like, you know, okay, they're good for
[04:29:09] you, but perhaps not going to eat that because I'm just not into it. Into the taste or whatever,
[04:29:13] just not like, um, a sparrig. Yes. You know, people like a sparrig is just ulting up nice.
[04:29:18] I, I think it tastes kind of junk. So I'm not going to be excited for a sparrig. Okay.
[04:29:23] So the good thing and this is why I think a lot of most people like this energy drink,
[04:29:29] because when you drink it and you have no guilt, you know that it's actually good for you. It's not
[04:29:33] like a sparrig. It's seem seen. Well, a sparrig is good for you, but it tastes bad. Yes.
[04:29:38] Discipline go is good for you. And it tastes good. That's bonus. Exactly right. And I think people like it.
[04:29:44] Especially the mango one. By the way, I hear great things about the mango. Check. If you want to get

[04:30:15] March shirt. Okay. And it's pretty square away. The shirt locker is the membership. Did you make the
