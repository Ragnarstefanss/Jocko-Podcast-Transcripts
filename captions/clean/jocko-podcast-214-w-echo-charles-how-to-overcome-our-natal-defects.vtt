00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.44
This is Jockelpontcast number 214.

2
00:00:03.44 --> 00:00:06.44
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.44 --> 00:00:07.44
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:08.44
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.44 --> 00:00:14.48
Dear George, at 0700 this morning,

6
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:18.68
the BBC announced that the German radio had just come out

7
00:00:18.68 --> 00:00:23.12
with an announcement of the landing of Allied paratroops

8
00:00:23.12 --> 00:00:26.64
and of large numbers of assault craft near the shore.

9
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:29.000
So that is it.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.32
This group of unconscribable heroes

11
00:00:33.32 --> 00:00:37.64
whom I command are not in yet, but we will be soon.

12
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:41.64
I wish I was there now as it is a lovely sunny day for battle

13
00:00:41.64 --> 00:00:44.60
and I am fed up with just sitting.

14
00:00:44.60 --> 00:00:47.88
I have no immediate idea of being killed,

15
00:00:47.88 --> 00:00:50.80
but one can never tell and none of us can live forever.

16
00:00:50.80 --> 00:00:54.44
So if I should go, don't worry, but set yourself

17
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:57.000
to do better than I have.

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.24
All men are timid on entering any fight.

19
00:01:00.24 --> 00:01:03.52
Whether it is the first fight or the last fight,

20
00:01:03.52 --> 00:01:06.08
all of us are timid.

21
00:01:06.08 --> 00:01:08.60
Cowards are those who let their timidity

22
00:01:08.60 --> 00:01:10.80
get the better of their manhood.

23
00:01:12.08 --> 00:01:14.76
You will never do that because of your bloodlines

24
00:01:14.76 --> 00:01:16.92
on both sides.

25
00:01:16.92 --> 00:01:20.64
I think I've told you the story of Marshall Torraine

26
00:01:20.64 --> 00:01:24.64
who fought under Louis XIV.

27
00:01:24.64 --> 00:01:27.68
On the morning of one of his last battles,

28
00:01:27.68 --> 00:01:29.56
he had been fighting for 40 years.

29
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:31.72
He was mounting his horse when a young aide

30
00:01:31.72 --> 00:01:34.28
to camp who had just come from the court

31
00:01:34.28 --> 00:01:37.36
and had never missed a meal or heard a hostile shot.

32
00:01:37.36 --> 00:01:40.60
Said Mr. Torraine, it amazes me

33
00:01:40.60 --> 00:01:42.80
that a man of your supposed courage

34
00:01:42.80 --> 00:01:45.16
should permit his knees to tremble

35
00:01:45.16 --> 00:01:46.92
as he walks out to Mount.

36
00:01:48.16 --> 00:01:49.56
Torraine replied,

37
00:01:49.56 --> 00:01:52.68
my Lord Duke, I admit that my Nate knees do tremble.

38
00:01:52.68 --> 00:01:57.68
But should they know where I shall this day take them,

39
00:01:57.68 --> 00:01:59.72
they would shake even more?

40
00:02:01.52 --> 00:02:03.04
That is it.

41
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:04.84
Your knees may shake,

42
00:02:04.84 --> 00:02:07.60
but they will always take you toward the enemy.

43
00:02:08.92 --> 00:02:10.44
Well, so much for that.

44
00:02:10.44 --> 00:02:13.72
There are apparently two types of successful soldiers.

45
00:02:13.72 --> 00:02:17.000
Those who get on by being unobtrusive

46
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.68
and those who get on by being obtrusive.

47
00:02:19.68 --> 00:02:24.16
I am of the latter type and seem to be rare

48
00:02:24.16 --> 00:02:26.92
and unpopular, but it is my method.

49
00:02:26.92 --> 00:02:30.04
One has to choose a system and stick to it.

50
00:02:30.04 --> 00:02:34.52
People who are not themselves are nobody.

51
00:02:35.80 --> 00:02:40.68
To be a successful soldier, you must know history.

52
00:02:40.68 --> 00:02:43.20
Read it objectively.

53
00:02:43.20 --> 00:02:48.000
Dates and even the minute details of tactics are useless.

54
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
What you must know is how man reacts.

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Weapons change, but man who uses them changes not at all.

56
00:03:01.56 --> 00:03:04.20
To win battles, you do not beat weapons.

57
00:03:04.20 --> 00:03:07.76
You beat the soul of man of the enemy.

58
00:03:10.56 --> 00:03:13.08
To do that, you have to destroy his weapons,

59
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:15.52
but that is only incidental.

60
00:03:15.52 --> 00:03:16.92
You must read biography

61
00:03:16.92 --> 00:03:18.80
and especially autobiography.

62
00:03:19.80 --> 00:03:24.000
If you do that, it will, you will find that war is simple.

63
00:03:25.20 --> 00:03:27.56
Decide what will hurt the enemy most

64
00:03:27.56 --> 00:03:30.000
within the limits of your capabilities to harm him

65
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.04
and then do it.

66
00:03:32.52 --> 00:03:34.92
Take calculated risks.

67
00:03:34.92 --> 00:03:37.12
That is quite different from being rash.

68
00:03:37.12 --> 00:03:41.12
My personal belief is that if you have a 50% chance,

69
00:03:41.12 --> 00:03:44.04
take it because of the superior fighting qualities

70
00:03:44.04 --> 00:03:47.20
of American soldiers lead me, led by me,

71
00:03:47.20 --> 00:03:50.88
will surely give you the extra 1% necessary.

72
00:03:52.20 --> 00:03:54.84
Incidentally, I decided as a result of my information

73
00:03:54.84 --> 00:03:57.92
observations and a sixth sense that I have

74
00:03:57.92 --> 00:04:00.24
that the enemy did not have another large scale

75
00:04:00.24 --> 00:04:01.72
attack in his system.

76
00:04:02.76 --> 00:04:05.28
I bet my shirt on that and I was right.

77
00:04:06.36 --> 00:04:10.36
You cannot make war safely, but no dead general

78
00:04:10.36 --> 00:04:12.68
has ever been criticized.

79
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:15.08
So you have that way out always.

80
00:04:16.80 --> 00:04:19.88
I am sure that if every leader who goes into battle

81
00:04:19.88 --> 00:04:22.60
will promise himself that he will either come out

82
00:04:22.60 --> 00:04:26.88
a conqueror or a corpse, he is sure to win.

83
00:04:28.28 --> 00:04:29.72
There is no doubt of that.

84
00:04:31.24 --> 00:04:33.72
Defeat is not due to losses,

85
00:04:33.72 --> 00:04:37.60
but to the destruction of the soul of the leaders.

86
00:04:37.60 --> 00:04:42.60
The most vital quality a soldier can possess

87
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:52.20
is self-confidence, utter, complete and bumpuous.

88
00:04:52.20 --> 00:04:54.08
You can have doubts about your good looks,

89
00:04:54.08 --> 00:04:56.60
about your intelligence, about your self-control,

90
00:04:56.60 --> 00:04:59.24
but to win in war, you must have no doubts

91
00:04:59.24 --> 00:05:01.24
about your ability as a soldier.

92
00:05:03.08 --> 00:05:06.08
What success I have had results from the fact

93
00:05:06.08 --> 00:05:08.16
that I have always been certain that my military

94
00:05:08.16 --> 00:05:09.72
reactions were correct.

95
00:05:11.12 --> 00:05:13.16
Many people do not agree with me.

96
00:05:13.16 --> 00:05:14.32
They are wrong.

97
00:05:15.60 --> 00:05:20.000
The un-airing jury of history written long after both of us

98
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
are dead will prove me correct.

99
00:05:23.16 --> 00:05:26.36
Note that I speak of military reactions.

100
00:05:26.36 --> 00:05:28.96
No one is born with them anymore than anyone is born

101
00:05:28.96 --> 00:05:30.000
with muscles.

102
00:05:31.24 --> 00:05:34.52
You can be born with the soul capable of correct military

103
00:05:34.52 --> 00:05:38.48
reactions or the body capable of having big muscles,

104
00:05:38.48 --> 00:05:42.56
but both qualities must be developed by hard work.

105
00:05:44.68 --> 00:05:46.84
The intensity of your desire to acquire

106
00:05:46.84 --> 00:05:50.48
any special ability depends on character, on ambition.

107
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:53.64
I think that your decision to study this summer

108
00:05:53.64 --> 00:05:55.52
instead of enjoying yourself shows

109
00:05:55.52 --> 00:05:57.44
that you have character and ambition.

110
00:05:58.64 --> 00:06:01.32
And they are wonderful possessions.

111
00:06:01.32 --> 00:06:06.32
Soldiers, all men in fact are natural hero worshippers.

112
00:06:07.68 --> 00:06:11.20
Officers with a flare for command realize this

113
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:15.000
and emphasize in their conduct, dress and deportment.

114
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.36
The qualities they seek to produce in their men.

115
00:06:20.64 --> 00:06:22.48
When I was a second lieutenant,

116
00:06:22.48 --> 00:06:25.92
I had a captain who was very sloppy and usually late.

117
00:06:25.92 --> 00:06:30.16
He got after his men for just those faults.

118
00:06:30.16 --> 00:06:32.76
He was a failure.

119
00:06:32.76 --> 00:06:37.36
The troops I have commanded have always been well dressed,

120
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:40.60
been smart saluters, been prompt and bold and action

121
00:06:40.60 --> 00:06:44.28
because I have personally set the example in these qualities.

122
00:06:44.28 --> 00:06:48.28
The influence one man can have on thousands

123
00:06:48.28 --> 00:06:50.92
is a never-ending source of wonder to me.

124
00:06:50.92 --> 00:06:53.60
You are always on parade.

125
00:06:53.60 --> 00:06:58.60
Officers who through laziness or a foolish desire

126
00:06:59.16 --> 00:07:02.56
to be popular fail to enforce discipline

127
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:05.000
and the proper wearing of uniforms and equipment,

128
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.72
not in the presence of the enemy,

129
00:07:06.72 --> 00:07:09.08
will also fail in battle.

130
00:07:11.36 --> 00:07:15.24
And if they fail in battle, they are potential mergers.

131
00:07:17.60 --> 00:07:20.76
There is no such thing as a good field soldier.

132
00:07:20.76 --> 00:07:24.60
You are either a good soldier or a bad soldier.

133
00:07:26.84 --> 00:07:29.12
Well, this has been quite a sermon,

134
00:07:30.12 --> 00:07:33.44
but don't get the idea that it is my swan song

135
00:07:33.44 --> 00:07:34.56
because it is not.

136
00:07:36.92 --> 00:07:40.40
I have not finished my job yet.

137
00:07:42.12 --> 00:07:45.40
Signed your affectionate father.

138
00:07:47.36 --> 00:07:49.16
And that right there, if you haven't guessed

139
00:07:49.16 --> 00:07:52.24
as a letter from General George S. Patent

140
00:07:52.24 --> 00:07:55.44
to his son, the George as the day unfolded.

141
00:07:57.88 --> 00:08:01.48
And as you can see from the letter

142
00:08:01.48 --> 00:08:03.28
and also if you know anything about Patent,

143
00:08:03.28 --> 00:08:07.56
at all he was well known, not only for his skill and battle

144
00:08:07.56 --> 00:08:12.56
and as a tactician and as a leader, but also well known

145
00:08:12.56 --> 00:08:13.56
for his ego.

146
00:08:15.60 --> 00:08:17.000
Let me read this part again.

147
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.36
The most vital quality a soldier can possess

148
00:08:19.36 --> 00:08:22.76
his self confidence, utter complete and bump to us.

149
00:08:24.12 --> 00:08:29.12
And what bump truss means is is proud to a degree

150
00:08:29.84 --> 00:08:30.96
where it's irritating.

151
00:08:30.96 --> 00:08:32.96
So it means what it sounds like, right?

152
00:08:32.96 --> 00:08:34.92
And he's saying that's how you need to be.

153
00:08:34.92 --> 00:08:37.40
He continues on, you can have doubts about your good looks

154
00:08:37.40 --> 00:08:39.56
about your intelligence, about your self control,

155
00:08:39.56 --> 00:08:41.32
but to win in war you must have no doubts

156
00:08:41.32 --> 00:08:43.44
about your ability as a soldier.

157
00:08:43.44 --> 00:08:47.92
What success I have had results from the fact

158
00:08:47.92 --> 00:08:49.96
that I have always been certain

159
00:08:49.96 --> 00:08:52.96
that my military reactions were correct.

160
00:08:52.96 --> 00:08:54.76
Many people do not agree with me, they are wrong.

161
00:08:54.76 --> 00:08:59.76
Now, that's obviously very contrary to what I think,

162
00:09:02.96 --> 00:09:06.64
which is the most important characteristic

163
00:09:06.64 --> 00:09:09.44
for a leader to have is humility.

164
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:12.68
So we're actually saying the exact opposite things here.

165
00:09:12.68 --> 00:09:14.40
I mean straight up the opposite things.

166
00:09:14.40 --> 00:09:16.52
He's saying the most important thing is self confidence,

167
00:09:16.52 --> 00:09:17.88
but he doesn't say self confidence.

168
00:09:17.88 --> 00:09:20.96
He says utter and complete and bump truss.

169
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:22.20
That's what he says.

170
00:09:22.20 --> 00:09:23.88
That's not, that's not humility.

171
00:09:25.96 --> 00:09:29.32
So where does this wash out?

172
00:09:32.24 --> 00:09:36.60
We have to remember that the patent's career was not unblumished.

173
00:09:36.60 --> 00:09:39.04
And this is the thing that I'm gonna keep kind of tying

174
00:09:39.04 --> 00:09:39.88
this back to.

175
00:09:41.12 --> 00:09:42.60
A lot of the things that I think

176
00:09:42.60 --> 00:09:44.64
you remember when we did

177
00:09:46.32 --> 00:09:49.28
Chairman Mao and we talked about

178
00:09:49.28 --> 00:09:53.72
Chairman Mao and his methodology for winning in guerrilla war.

179
00:09:53.72 --> 00:09:56.28
And everything that he said,

180
00:09:57.96 --> 00:10:00.68
well, it wasn't like aligned with what I say.

181
00:10:00.68 --> 00:10:02.56
And what are the key components of that?

182
00:10:02.56 --> 00:10:04.44
Maybe not everything, but a lot of what he was saying

183
00:10:04.44 --> 00:10:05.72
and I'd have to review it again,

184
00:10:05.72 --> 00:10:07.000
but a lot of what he was saying,

185
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.12
but one thing that he absolutely said,

186
00:10:10.12 --> 00:10:15.12
Chairman Mao, father of communist China,

187
00:10:16.60 --> 00:10:19.84
said all throughout that the leaders in the field

188
00:10:19.84 --> 00:10:22.04
need to make decisions, they need to step up,

189
00:10:22.04 --> 00:10:23.92
they need to lead at what he's talking about

190
00:10:23.92 --> 00:10:25.000
his decentralized command.

191
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.08
And what puzzles me about that is

192
00:10:27.08 --> 00:10:30.96
because he recognized that you needed to have decentralized

193
00:10:30.96 --> 00:10:35.16
command for a military victory, right to win.

194
00:10:35.16 --> 00:10:38.32
But then he never transposed that idea

195
00:10:38.32 --> 00:10:40.64
of decentralized command into his government.

196
00:10:40.64 --> 00:10:44.04
And we actually do know that centralized government

197
00:10:44.04 --> 00:10:47.24
doesn't work any better than centralized military

198
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:49.20
command than centralized business leadership.

199
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:50.04
It doesn't work.

200
00:10:51.20 --> 00:10:53.56
So he never made that connection apparently.

201
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:56.36
And sometimes when I read about patent,

202
00:10:56.36 --> 00:10:57.64
if you know about patent,

203
00:10:59.04 --> 00:11:00.40
and you know about his career

204
00:11:00.40 --> 00:11:02.40
and you know what happened to him,

205
00:11:02.40 --> 00:11:07.28
sometimes you, it hurts a little bit to know

206
00:11:07.28 --> 00:11:10.08
that this guy who was such a great patriot,

207
00:11:10.08 --> 00:11:11.64
who was such a great tactician,

208
00:11:11.64 --> 00:11:14.36
that if he could have applied some of his principles

209
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:15.80
of leadership on the battlefield,

210
00:11:15.80 --> 00:11:20.04
if he could have applied those to his interactions

211
00:11:20.04 --> 00:11:23.40
with other people, he might have ended up

212
00:11:23.40 --> 00:11:24.92
in a much better position.

213
00:11:27.08 --> 00:11:28.24
And we'll get into some of that.

214
00:11:28.24 --> 00:11:31.36
Some of the things that he did,

215
00:11:31.36 --> 00:11:37.32
one, there was an attack on a place called Fort Giante,

216
00:11:37.32 --> 00:11:38.64
in the fall of 1944.

217
00:11:38.64 --> 00:11:41.08
And I got this little, I wanted to kind of summarize it.

218
00:11:41.08 --> 00:11:44.56
And there's a thing called the warfare history network

219
00:11:44.56 --> 00:11:46.08
that summarized it very well.

220
00:11:46.08 --> 00:11:48.36
It said the entire operation gradually settled

221
00:11:48.36 --> 00:11:50.60
into a stalemate with the Americans

222
00:11:50.60 --> 00:11:52.84
unable to achieve any further gains

223
00:11:52.84 --> 00:11:54.72
and the men hanging on desperately

224
00:11:54.72 --> 00:11:57.12
to what had been won in the hard fighting.

225
00:11:57.12 --> 00:11:59.52
Food, water, and ammunition were running out

226
00:11:59.52 --> 00:12:02.04
and the men holding positions underground

227
00:12:02.04 --> 00:12:05.24
were exposed to the dust and fumes of the tunnels

228
00:12:05.24 --> 00:12:08.60
by October 9th, Patent's attitude about the attack

229
00:12:08.60 --> 00:12:10.96
had changed completely.

230
00:12:10.96 --> 00:12:14.36
He said the show is going sour, we will have to pull out.

231
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.96
It had quickly become a no win situation for the Americans

232
00:12:18.96 --> 00:12:22.48
because both daylight and nocturnal salts had failed.

233
00:12:22.48 --> 00:12:24.72
Daytime attacks were vulnerable to the deadly fire

234
00:12:24.72 --> 00:12:28.68
that rained down on Fort Giante from the adjacent forts

235
00:12:28.68 --> 00:12:30.84
at night assaults were quickly broken up

236
00:12:30.84 --> 00:12:33.12
and driven into confusion when the German squads

237
00:12:33.12 --> 00:12:35.28
emerged from their underground tunnels.

238
00:12:35.28 --> 00:12:39.82
The third army suffered 64 men killed 547 wounded,

239
00:12:39.82 --> 00:12:43.36
187 missing assumed captured,

240
00:12:43.36 --> 00:12:45.68
so and not achieving the objective.

241
00:12:45.68 --> 00:12:48.68
So that's not good, right?

242
00:12:48.68 --> 00:12:52.36
So the idea to think that everything I think of is correct.

243
00:12:54.68 --> 00:12:57.32
And there you go, even Patent, guess what he had to do?

244
00:12:57.32 --> 00:12:59.92
He had to go, okay, this isn't working.

245
00:12:59.92 --> 00:13:01.12
He might not like to admit that,

246
00:13:01.12 --> 00:13:02.92
but he had to work and do well.

247
00:13:02.92 --> 00:13:05.88
And let's just not do this.

248
00:13:05.88 --> 00:13:10.88
Another thing he did, he orchestrated a raid

249
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:15.88
on a POW camp called O'Flog 13B.

250
00:13:17.08 --> 00:13:18.16
It was impolent.

251
00:13:18.16 --> 00:13:21.12
And there's, I'm not going to go into the details now,

252
00:13:21.12 --> 00:13:23.80
but he actually thought that perhaps his son-in-law

253
00:13:23.80 --> 00:13:24.92
was a prisoner there.

254
00:13:24.92 --> 00:13:29.92
And so he organized this raid and a guy named Abraham Baum,

255
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.08
conducted the raid, 300 men went on the mission,

256
00:13:36.08 --> 00:13:40.60
of which 32 were confirmed killed in action

257
00:13:40.60 --> 00:13:45.60
and another 200 over 200 were missing or taken prisoner

258
00:13:45.76 --> 00:13:50.28
and only 35 of the 300 made it back to friendly lines.

259
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:52.48
So that is not good.

260
00:13:52.48 --> 00:13:56.000
And then on top of that, here's where I look at

261
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.24
and I say if he would have had more humility.

262
00:13:59.24 --> 00:14:02.40
And once again, I gotta say this, right?

263
00:14:02.40 --> 00:14:03.60
Cause I talk about humility all the time.

264
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:05.52
There's a reason that I talk about humility, it's all time.

265
00:14:05.52 --> 00:14:06.60
Okay, in the dichotomy of leadership,

266
00:14:06.60 --> 00:14:07.44
can you be too humble?

267
00:14:07.44 --> 00:14:08.56
Echo Charles, can you be too humble?

268
00:14:08.56 --> 00:14:09.40
Yes.

269
00:14:09.40 --> 00:14:10.48
Yes, you can.

270
00:14:10.48 --> 00:14:12.08
Can you have too much confidence?

271
00:14:12.08 --> 00:14:14.56
Yes, that becomes arrogant, it's an ego, that's bad.

272
00:14:14.56 --> 00:14:16.72
The reason that I talk about humility so much

273
00:14:16.72 --> 00:14:20.36
is because it is the of the two leanings

274
00:14:20.36 --> 00:14:24.52
that people can make in the dichotomy most of the time,

275
00:14:24.52 --> 00:14:27.32
most of the time, it's their two confidence.

276
00:14:27.32 --> 00:14:29.04
That's most of the time, right?

277
00:14:29.04 --> 00:14:30.80
Cause if you have someone that's moving into a leadership

278
00:14:30.80 --> 00:14:33.48
position, they have to have some confidence to get there.

279
00:14:33.48 --> 00:14:35.64
So therefore, a person in leadership position

280
00:14:35.64 --> 00:14:37.80
is gonna lean towards having confidence,

281
00:14:37.80 --> 00:14:40.000
which is gonna lean them towards if they're gonna be

282
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.20
either not confident enough or too confident,

283
00:14:42.20 --> 00:14:44.36
they're gonna lean towards too much confidence, right?

284
00:14:44.36 --> 00:14:45.76
Because the person that lacks confident

285
00:14:45.76 --> 00:14:47.04
will they're not in the leadership position?

286
00:14:47.04 --> 00:14:48.60
They didn't work to didn't maneuver

287
00:14:48.60 --> 00:14:50.08
to get the they didn't believe in themselves.

288
00:14:50.08 --> 00:14:51.12
So they didn't really get there.

289
00:14:51.12 --> 00:14:53.60
Are there times where you have to talk to a leader

290
00:14:53.60 --> 00:14:55.000
about hey, you need more confidence,

291
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.60
you need to be less humble, absolutely.

292
00:14:56.60 --> 00:14:57.72
There are times.

293
00:14:57.72 --> 00:14:59.64
But Pat and clearly,

294
00:14:59.64 --> 00:15:04.64
was an example of he lean towards too much ego, too much confidence.

295
00:15:05.88 --> 00:15:09.92
So what I'm saying is, and that was part of his power, too, right?

296
00:15:09.92 --> 00:15:12.16
You get around someone that's super confident about things

297
00:15:12.16 --> 00:15:14.000
and they're like, oh no, we're gonna make this happen.

298
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.52
And you go, yes, we are, I'm following this guy.

299
00:15:16.52 --> 00:15:19.20
So confidence, an ego is a positive thing.

300
00:15:19.20 --> 00:15:20.68
It absolutely is.

301
00:15:22.20 --> 00:15:24.68
Too much of it, and you can get yourself in trouble.

302
00:15:24.68 --> 00:15:26.36
Let's look at what happened

303
00:15:26.36 --> 00:15:28.32
at towards the end of the war.

304
00:15:28.32 --> 00:15:30.88
Pat and got relieved of command.

305
00:15:30.88 --> 00:15:34.88
They moved him out of commanding combat troops

306
00:15:34.88 --> 00:15:37.56
and they moved him into a position

307
00:15:38.64 --> 00:15:42.24
which was a, it was like a,

308
00:15:43.36 --> 00:15:44.68
what's that word?

309
00:15:44.68 --> 00:15:46.44
It was like a figurehead position.

310
00:15:46.44 --> 00:15:47.68
Okay, cool.

311
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:51.16
They put him in charge of the 15th army,

312
00:15:51.16 --> 00:15:52.08
which sounds really cool,

313
00:15:52.08 --> 00:15:54.68
but they were actually just responsible

314
00:15:54.68 --> 00:15:57.96
for capturing the history of what was happening.

315
00:15:57.96 --> 00:16:01.000
So we're talking low impact job.

316
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.20
No, and by the way, no command in the Pacific,

317
00:16:05.20 --> 00:16:06.96
because they were still fighting and he wanted

318
00:16:06.96 --> 00:16:11.44
to go to the Pacific, didn't take over any major troops.

319
00:16:11.44 --> 00:16:14.16
Didn't even go, didn't even go to Pacific theater.

320
00:16:14.16 --> 00:16:17.80
Not even in charge of like the occupation army,

321
00:16:17.80 --> 00:16:20.36
in Germany, not even in charge of that.

322
00:16:20.36 --> 00:16:21.48
So think about that.

323
00:16:21.48 --> 00:16:26.48
Here's this guy, and because of his tactical prowess,

324
00:16:29.64 --> 00:16:31.68
he did great on the battlefield,

325
00:16:31.68 --> 00:16:33.80
but as soon as they could,

326
00:16:33.80 --> 00:16:36.72
they shifted him over and put him out the pasture.

327
00:16:36.72 --> 00:16:37.56
Why is that?

328
00:16:37.56 --> 00:16:38.56
Because of his ego.

329
00:16:38.56 --> 00:16:43.56
So that's what bombs me out is because,

330
00:16:43.56 --> 00:16:46.92
if he would have just had some humility to think,

331
00:16:46.92 --> 00:16:49.32
how am I going to play this game a little bit better?

332
00:16:49.32 --> 00:16:53.16
How am I going to interact with my superiors?

333
00:16:53.16 --> 00:16:55.72
With my superior officers, how am I going to interact with them?

334
00:16:55.72 --> 00:16:57.88
He probably would have, if he absolutely,

335
00:16:57.88 --> 00:16:59.32
I should have probably, would he absolutely

336
00:16:59.32 --> 00:17:02.52
could have ended up being the Supreme Allied commander, for sure?

337
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.60
But he didn't.

338
00:17:06.60 --> 00:17:09.84
So that being said, of course,

339
00:17:09.84 --> 00:17:13.32
there's all kinds of things we can learn from Patton.

340
00:17:13.32 --> 00:17:14.36
And who knows, maybe he was right.

341
00:17:14.36 --> 00:17:17.92
This maybe his son wasn't a very confident person.

342
00:17:17.92 --> 00:17:20.88
Maybe he was trying to balk balk to his son up

343
00:17:20.88 --> 00:17:22.44
in this particular letter.

344
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:26.44
But there's a lot of things that he wrote.

345
00:17:26.44 --> 00:17:30.48
And I mean, there's a lot, and it's awesome to read.

346
00:17:30.48 --> 00:17:33.76
But last time we covered Letter of Instruction One and Two

347
00:17:33.76 --> 00:17:37.08
to his troops, this is again, going back towards prior

348
00:17:37.08 --> 00:17:37.92
to D.T.

349
00:17:37.92 --> 00:17:38.64
D.T.

350
00:17:38.64 --> 00:17:42.44
And we might as well just jump into Letter of Instruction Number Three.

351
00:17:42.44 --> 00:17:46.88
Now this one was very, very tactical.

352
00:17:46.88 --> 00:17:50.52
And by that, I mean, I should, shouldn't even say tactical,

353
00:17:50.52 --> 00:17:51.92
because tactics is good.

354
00:17:51.92 --> 00:17:55.92
Very specific talking about types of armor

355
00:17:55.92 --> 00:17:59.64
and what to do in very specific situations.

356
00:17:59.64 --> 00:18:02.20
So I'm going to take a little bit less from this letter,

357
00:18:02.20 --> 00:18:06.44
but there is a bunch of things in here that are relevant,

358
00:18:06.44 --> 00:18:09.80
are powerful, and things that anybody that's

359
00:18:09.80 --> 00:18:11.48
in a leadership situation can utilize.

360
00:18:11.48 --> 00:18:15.80
So this one's a little bit, I'm jumping around a bit.

361
00:18:15.80 --> 00:18:17.16
I should, since I'm jumping around,

362
00:18:17.16 --> 00:18:19.20
but I'm skipping more stuff in this letter,

363
00:18:19.20 --> 00:18:20.92
but you can find these online if you want to.

364
00:18:20.92 --> 00:18:24.28
So one of the things he says to begin with,

365
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:28.48
haste and speed are not synonymous.

366
00:18:28.48 --> 00:18:31.48
By this, I mean that hasty attacks do not produce

367
00:18:31.48 --> 00:18:34.48
speedy successes or speedy advances,

368
00:18:34.48 --> 00:18:37.28
because hasty attacks are not coordinated attacks,

369
00:18:37.28 --> 00:18:38.20
haste makes ways.

370
00:18:38.20 --> 00:18:41.44
So rushing to get something done, not effective.

371
00:18:41.44 --> 00:18:43.16
Hey, that's what he means by haste,

372
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:46.28
which is weird, because I think when I think of the word haste,

373
00:18:46.28 --> 00:18:48.24
and I don't want to dive into like the etymology

374
00:18:48.24 --> 00:18:52.76
of the word haste, but I think it has a little bit of a,

375
00:18:52.76 --> 00:18:55.72
now it is, I think it has a little bit of a positive

376
00:18:55.72 --> 00:18:56.56
connotation, right?

377
00:18:56.56 --> 00:18:58.56
Hey, we need to make haste, we need to move quick,

378
00:18:58.56 --> 00:19:02.52
like it's a good thing, but I think even just this short time

379
00:19:02.52 --> 00:19:07.24
ago, it's more aligned with the idea of haste makes

380
00:19:07.24 --> 00:19:08.08
a waste, right?

381
00:19:08.08 --> 00:19:10.000
Like if it's more like rushing,

382
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.08
because rushing doesn't have a positive connotation, right?

383
00:19:13.08 --> 00:19:15.96
You say, hey, you need to rush, like no one says that.

384
00:19:15.96 --> 00:19:19.28
No one says, hey, rush with your homework to your kid.

385
00:19:19.28 --> 00:19:22.24
You don't say rush, no you say hurry.

386
00:19:22.24 --> 00:19:25.64
You need to say move faster, but you don't say,

387
00:19:25.64 --> 00:19:29.92
you don't say rush, because that means you're going to miss something.

388
00:19:29.92 --> 00:19:34.28
Yeah, almost like rush means hurry with the note

389
00:19:34.28 --> 00:19:36.48
that it's like in a negative way.

390
00:19:36.48 --> 00:19:40.52
Or in a like, and so I think this at this time here at haste

391
00:19:40.52 --> 00:19:42.84
had that connotation as well.

392
00:19:42.84 --> 00:19:46.64
So he's saying haste makes ways to continuing in an armored

393
00:19:46.64 --> 00:19:50.72
division as an infantry division, attacks must be coordinated

394
00:19:50.72 --> 00:19:56.12
and the infantry and the tanks and the guns must work as a unit.

395
00:19:56.12 --> 00:19:59.36
Success depends upon the coordinated use of guns and the tanks.

396
00:19:59.36 --> 00:20:00.24
So what does that mean?

397
00:20:00.24 --> 00:20:01.52
Covered move.

398
00:20:01.52 --> 00:20:04.92
That's what it means, work together as a team.

399
00:20:04.92 --> 00:20:07.64
All your different elements in your company and your team

400
00:20:07.64 --> 00:20:10.04
and your business need to work together.

401
00:20:10.04 --> 00:20:13.36
Wouldn't that seem obvious?

402
00:20:13.36 --> 00:20:14.52
Wouldn't it seem obvious?

403
00:20:14.52 --> 00:20:14.80
Yeah.

404
00:20:14.80 --> 00:20:15.96
It's not obvious.

405
00:20:15.96 --> 00:20:17.64
Well, it's obvious hard to do.

406
00:20:17.64 --> 00:20:19.16
People don't do it like they should.

407
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:21.32
Yeah, one of the many things that seem obvious

408
00:20:21.32 --> 00:20:23.72
is they had or when you're not involved in it,

409
00:20:23.72 --> 00:20:25.16
but then you know in science.

410
00:20:25.16 --> 00:20:27.60
You know, that's why in leadership strategy and tactics

411
00:20:27.60 --> 00:20:31.08
when I was talking about what to do is a new leader.

412
00:20:31.08 --> 00:20:35.44
And I say like read this before you go into a meeting, read this

413
00:20:35.44 --> 00:20:37.76
when you go to bed at night because you can't just read it.

414
00:20:37.76 --> 00:20:38.76
Go, cool.

415
00:20:38.76 --> 00:20:39.60
Okay, I read through now.

416
00:20:39.60 --> 00:20:40.40
I'm good.

417
00:20:40.40 --> 00:20:42.48
No, you need to embed it into your brain.

418
00:20:42.48 --> 00:20:43.80
Read what the laws of combat.

419
00:20:43.80 --> 00:20:47.36
No, the section on page 158 of leadership strategy,

420
00:20:47.36 --> 00:20:49.52
the tactics and everything that I know that is because people

421
00:20:49.52 --> 00:20:52.04
people said, oh, I just answered, I go, I go to page 150

422
00:20:52.04 --> 00:20:53.60
and leadership strategy and tactics.

423
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:55.56
But you can't just read it one time, be like, okay, no,

424
00:20:55.56 --> 00:20:58.56
you need to embed those things into your brain.

425
00:20:58.56 --> 00:20:59.72
Yeah.

426
00:20:59.72 --> 00:21:01.28
It's something kind of like this, right?

427
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:02.76
How long does it take to embed in the brain

428
00:21:02.76 --> 00:21:04.48
that, oh, we need to work together?

429
00:21:07.60 --> 00:21:08.96
A little bit more cover and move here.

430
00:21:08.96 --> 00:21:11.32
When tanks are advancing, they must use their guns

431
00:21:11.32 --> 00:21:12.68
for what is known as recliner.

432
00:21:12.68 --> 00:21:13.80
Reconnaissance by fire.

433
00:21:13.80 --> 00:21:17.04
That is they must shoot at any terrestrial object

434
00:21:17.04 --> 00:21:19.68
behind which an anti tank gun might be concealed

435
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:22.000
and take these targets under fire to arrange

436
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.92
greater than the range at which an anti tank gun is effective.

437
00:21:25.92 --> 00:21:28.92
In other words, at a range of greater than 2,000 yards.

438
00:21:28.92 --> 00:21:30.12
Actually, that's not even really covered.

439
00:21:30.12 --> 00:21:31.40
It's kind of a little bit of cover move,

440
00:21:31.40 --> 00:21:33.84
but that's being proactive, right?

441
00:21:33.84 --> 00:21:36.44
Hey, there could be an anti tank gun over there.

442
00:21:36.44 --> 00:21:39.40
The anti tank gun has a range of whatever,

443
00:21:39.40 --> 00:21:42.20
a thousand meters at 2,000 meters.

444
00:21:42.20 --> 00:21:43.88
I'm hitting those targets.

445
00:21:44.96 --> 00:21:47.40
I'll somebody hit me up on it on Twitter

446
00:21:47.40 --> 00:21:50.000
and said there was a name for that type of shooting

447
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.12
and I can't remember what it is.

448
00:21:51.12 --> 00:21:53.44
But it's shooting where you think the enemy might be.

449
00:21:55.44 --> 00:21:57.88
In tank versus tank, doles the first round

450
00:21:57.88 --> 00:21:59.28
should be armor piercing.

451
00:22:00.44 --> 00:22:03.48
If this fails, the second round must be white phosphorus

452
00:22:03.48 --> 00:22:07.88
and short, so as to give our tank a chance to maneuver

453
00:22:07.88 --> 00:22:11.52
because by keeping its gun laid on with smoke,

454
00:22:11.52 --> 00:22:14.32
it has a better chance of getting in the second telling shot

455
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:18.24
than has the enemy who, when he emerges from the smoke,

456
00:22:18.24 --> 00:22:20.20
does not know the location of our vehicle,

457
00:22:20.20 --> 00:22:22.24
armored infantry should make a violent attack

458
00:22:22.24 --> 00:22:23.32
using all its men and weapons.

459
00:22:23.32 --> 00:22:24.92
So that's a cool one.

460
00:22:24.92 --> 00:22:29.20
If you fire your first shot, cool the second shot,

461
00:22:29.20 --> 00:22:32.40
you've got to put some smoke out so they can't see what you're doing.

462
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:34.000
You should have hit him on the first shot.

463
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.52
If you don't, you're good because you put in some smoke

464
00:22:36.52 --> 00:22:39.04
where you still know where he is,

465
00:22:39.04 --> 00:22:40.88
but he has to look through this giant smoke.

466
00:22:40.88 --> 00:22:43.80
And so when he, when the smoke clears,

467
00:22:43.80 --> 00:22:46.48
he doesn't know where you are and you're getting another round on him.

468
00:22:48.88 --> 00:22:52.84
We used to set up our magazines

469
00:22:52.84 --> 00:22:55.92
with something called a party mix.

470
00:22:55.92 --> 00:22:58.80
So do you have different types of rounds for your weapon?

471
00:22:58.80 --> 00:23:01.68
And so guys would put like armor piercing rounds,

472
00:23:01.68 --> 00:23:04.48
like the first couple rounds armor piercing rounds.

473
00:23:04.48 --> 00:23:06.64
The second couple, I think everyone to do the own thing

474
00:23:06.64 --> 00:23:10.28
because like the second one would be like a,

475
00:23:11.28 --> 00:23:13.84
a more of an anti-personel type round.

476
00:23:13.84 --> 00:23:16.64
That's kind of, and this is against the Geneva convention.

477
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:18.32
It's not, it's not called an expanding round

478
00:23:18.32 --> 00:23:19.72
because it doesn't expand, but there's rounds

479
00:23:19.72 --> 00:23:21.64
that we have that tumble when they hit.

480
00:23:21.64 --> 00:23:23.68
So be some of those then, some tracers at the bottom.

481
00:23:23.68 --> 00:23:25.84
Like all kinds of, they can just,

482
00:23:25.84 --> 00:23:27.28
they set up a little party mix.

483
00:23:27.28 --> 00:23:28.72
Yeah, we do that with shotguns.

484
00:23:28.72 --> 00:23:30.08
Oh, we do, do we?

485
00:23:30.08 --> 00:23:30.92
We do, yeah.

486
00:23:30.92 --> 00:23:32.24
Look at his guy.

487
00:23:32.24 --> 00:23:33.40
Oh, tactical echo.

488
00:23:33.40 --> 00:23:34.52
Comment in how it's going to be.

489
00:23:34.52 --> 00:23:35.44
We're not going to be tactical.

490
00:23:35.44 --> 00:23:36.64
It's just anyway.

491
00:23:36.64 --> 00:23:37.48
Okay.

492
00:23:37.48 --> 00:23:39.68
Well, you know what I'm saying, right?

493
00:23:39.68 --> 00:23:40.52
That makes sense.

494
00:23:40.52 --> 00:23:41.52
All right.

495
00:23:41.52 --> 00:23:43.52
You understand that I understand what you're talking about.

496
00:23:43.52 --> 00:23:44.64
That's what I'm saying.

497
00:23:44.64 --> 00:23:46.52
Tactical echo coming in hot.

498
00:23:46.52 --> 00:23:47.92
That's what we do with shotguns.

499
00:23:47.92 --> 00:23:51.12
What party mix do you use, my friend?

500
00:23:51.12 --> 00:23:54.48
Educate, buckshot, birdshot, slug.

501
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:56.36
You'll have one after the other.

502
00:23:56.36 --> 00:23:57.36
So they're like different.

503
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:00.28
You can see how they feel, whatever.

504
00:24:00.28 --> 00:24:01.28
Yeah.

505
00:24:01.28 --> 00:24:03.56
What do you have in your home?

506
00:24:03.56 --> 00:24:04.56
Double.

507
00:24:04.56 --> 00:24:05.56
Okay.

508
00:24:05.56 --> 00:24:06.56
Okay.

509
00:24:06.56 --> 00:24:07.56
For the shotguns.

510
00:24:07.56 --> 00:24:08.56
Yes.

511
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:09.56
Double up.

512
00:24:09.56 --> 00:24:10.56
That's where you're going with.

513
00:24:10.56 --> 00:24:11.56
That's where we're going with.

514
00:24:11.56 --> 00:24:12.56
Okay.

515
00:24:12.56 --> 00:24:14.04
Both the end two and three.

516
00:24:14.04 --> 00:24:17.24
The whole magazine is filled with those.

517
00:24:17.24 --> 00:24:18.76
Well, they're not.

518
00:24:18.76 --> 00:24:19.76
That's what I have.

519
00:24:19.76 --> 00:24:21.16
But yeah, that's what I would.

520
00:24:21.16 --> 00:24:22.16
Yeah.

521
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:22.96
So you know what I feel the mega deep.

522
00:24:22.96 --> 00:24:23.96
I've got a slug.

523
00:24:23.96 --> 00:24:24.96
No.

524
00:24:24.96 --> 00:24:25.96
No.

525
00:24:25.96 --> 00:24:26.96
Okay.

526
00:24:26.96 --> 00:24:29.56
I think it's just for fun when you do the party mix.

527
00:24:29.56 --> 00:24:30.56
Yeah.

528
00:24:30.56 --> 00:24:33.000
Or it makes me, you know, my ass.

529
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
There we go.

530
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Yeah.

531
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
No, no, no.

532
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.64
The party mix is not for friend act for fun echo Charles.

533
00:24:37.64 --> 00:24:38.64
In my experience.

534
00:24:38.64 --> 00:24:39.64
In my experience.

535
00:24:39.64 --> 00:24:40.64
There's a reason for it.

536
00:24:40.64 --> 00:24:41.64
I got to think through it.

537
00:24:41.64 --> 00:24:43.52
There's a bunch of different reasons why you could set things up a different way.

538
00:24:43.52 --> 00:24:44.52
Right?

539
00:24:44.52 --> 00:24:45.52
Yes.

540
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:46.52
I would think so.

541
00:24:46.52 --> 00:24:47.52
You could.

542
00:24:47.52 --> 00:24:48.52
I understand.

543
00:24:48.52 --> 00:24:49.52
Check.

544
00:24:49.52 --> 00:24:51.000
This is welcome to the podcast.

545
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I'm so glad.

546
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.20
This guy got a gun.

547
00:24:53.20 --> 00:24:54.000
And now it's out.

548
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
I'm going to check.

549
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.92
Tell, let me know.

550
00:25:00.92 --> 00:25:02.24
I'm staying in my ear.

551
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:04.64
Tell Patten what's up.

552
00:25:04.64 --> 00:25:06.96
Oh, check.

553
00:25:06.96 --> 00:25:07.96
I probably just shut down.

554
00:25:07.96 --> 00:25:09.60
You ever say anything about my job.

555
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:10.60
I know.

556
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:12.000
I will be your channel bond with you in Patten.

557
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.16
But we're, we're, we're, we're one.

558
00:25:14.16 --> 00:25:15.16
Right.

559
00:25:15.16 --> 00:25:17.56
It is more important to get.

560
00:25:17.56 --> 00:25:21.96
It is more important to get the information back fast than to get it back secretly.

561
00:25:21.96 --> 00:25:25.24
Therefore, use clear with a limited code for name only.

562
00:25:25.24 --> 00:25:26.24
This is interesting.

563
00:25:26.24 --> 00:25:28.72
So you have encrypted radios.

564
00:25:28.72 --> 00:25:31.20
You have codes that you can use.

565
00:25:31.20 --> 00:25:35.80
And what he's saying is like, listen, and sometimes especially now, especially in the past,

566
00:25:35.80 --> 00:25:39.52
that would make transmitting information a lot harder.

567
00:25:39.52 --> 00:25:41.48
It takes the power away from the signal.

568
00:25:41.48 --> 00:25:43.92
Sometimes it just takes time to encrypt the message.

569
00:25:43.92 --> 00:25:47.32
And what he's saying is like, listen, it's more important that we get the information

570
00:25:47.32 --> 00:25:50.24
back there than it is that we keep it all secret.

571
00:25:50.24 --> 00:25:56.16
It's just an interesting point to me because it shows the importance of fast communication

572
00:25:56.16 --> 00:25:58.36
of letting people know what's happening.

573
00:25:58.36 --> 00:26:01.64
Yeah, this is obviously something you have to be careful of.

574
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:04.28
But it's an interesting point.

575
00:26:04.28 --> 00:26:08.32
Just the fact that you have to keep information flowing as quickly as possible.

576
00:26:08.32 --> 00:26:15.68
And at this time, keeping it moving fast would Trump keeping it secure.

577
00:26:15.68 --> 00:26:18.40
In tactical situations, because obviously there's strategic situations.

578
00:26:18.40 --> 00:26:21.48
I mean, we broke the German and NIGMA code.

579
00:26:21.48 --> 00:26:23.28
We broke the Japanese code.

580
00:26:23.28 --> 00:26:30.48
And that was massively important for us to win the wars.

581
00:26:30.48 --> 00:26:38.08
So continuing whenever German anti-tank guns have gotten our tanks, it has almost always

582
00:26:38.08 --> 00:26:41.72
been our own fault.

583
00:26:41.72 --> 00:26:48.32
Despite of years of instruction, tanks will go up obvious tank lanes, such as cart tracks,

584
00:26:48.32 --> 00:26:53.36
open river bottoms, small roads or path or along hedges, all of which any intelligent

585
00:26:53.36 --> 00:26:56.20
anti-tank gunner will have a range to cover.

586
00:26:56.20 --> 00:26:59.16
Isn't that brilliant?

587
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:04.40
Like when you're looking at the terrain, you can go on, oh, look at this path.

588
00:27:04.40 --> 00:27:05.72
If we go down that path, guess what?

589
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:08.92
The German gunners are expecting you to have path, and they're going to be waiting for you.

590
00:27:08.92 --> 00:27:13.16
It's also an interesting idea of ownership when we lose a tank.

591
00:27:13.16 --> 00:27:17.56
It's almost always our fault.

592
00:27:17.56 --> 00:27:20.44
Next, the German anti-tank gunners a good shot.

593
00:27:20.44 --> 00:27:21.72
We are better shots.

594
00:27:21.72 --> 00:27:22.96
He is unprotected.

595
00:27:22.96 --> 00:27:24.72
We are behind inches of steel.

596
00:27:24.72 --> 00:27:30.08
If we use our heads and our American ingenuity and initiative, we have nothing to fear

597
00:27:30.08 --> 00:27:32.04
from the German anti-tank guns.

598
00:27:32.04 --> 00:27:33.92
You know what's crazy?

599
00:27:33.92 --> 00:27:38.60
I just hit me as I'm reading this.

600
00:27:38.60 --> 00:27:44.16
That he's saying these things specifically because guys were scared of these German anti-tank

601
00:27:44.16 --> 00:27:46.32
guns.

602
00:27:46.32 --> 00:27:48.68
I'm just thinking about it from a tankers perspective.

603
00:27:48.68 --> 00:27:52.80
When you're at a tank, you're all claustrophobic, you're locked in this thing.

604
00:27:52.80 --> 00:27:58.68
It's this weird dichotomy.

605
00:27:58.68 --> 00:28:03.20
In one sense, you feel really protected, and in another sense, you feel completely vulnerable.

606
00:28:03.20 --> 00:28:07.12
You feel protected because all these little bullets aren't going to hurt you.

607
00:28:07.12 --> 00:28:12.12
Some mines aren't going to hurt you, but then at the same time, you know, one big hit, and

608
00:28:12.12 --> 00:28:14.36
there's nothing you can do about it.

609
00:28:14.36 --> 00:28:16.36
You're going to die.

610
00:28:16.36 --> 00:28:18.52
So that's an interesting thing.

611
00:28:18.52 --> 00:28:24.12
He's addressing that fault that can go through someone's head is like, okay, yeah, I feel

612
00:28:24.12 --> 00:28:27.72
protected, but also one hit, and I'm dead.

613
00:28:27.72 --> 00:28:36.08
The way that when you're armor gets pierced by an anti-tank gun, like the picture

614
00:28:36.08 --> 00:28:41.20
being in a tank, and there's just hot metal spraying around and they're going to kill

615
00:28:41.20 --> 00:28:42.20
you.

616
00:28:42.20 --> 00:28:44.60
Like it's an awful thing to picture.

617
00:28:44.60 --> 00:28:48.40
Is it hard, like, okay, when you're in the tank, it's kind of claustrophobic.

618
00:28:48.40 --> 00:28:50.88
Is it, is it hard to get in and out of this?

619
00:28:50.88 --> 00:28:57.04
Like it takes a little while, especially if you get hit with a mind, and you know,

620
00:28:57.04 --> 00:29:02.28
you these big giant steel doors, imagine how hard it is when that thing gets bent a little

621
00:29:02.28 --> 00:29:03.28
bit.

622
00:29:03.28 --> 00:29:07.48
You're not getting out.

623
00:29:07.48 --> 00:29:09.48
Oh man, you're going to panic in there.

624
00:29:09.48 --> 00:29:10.48
Well, I'm going to panic in there.

625
00:29:10.48 --> 00:29:12.84
Yeah, or even like if you, and not that this would happen all the time or whatever, I don't

626
00:29:12.84 --> 00:29:17.56
know, but like if you just tips over or something, and it's like, oh, we got to get out

627
00:29:17.56 --> 00:29:19.44
of here and you're like, kind of stock.

628
00:29:19.44 --> 00:29:20.44
Yeah, it's horrible.

629
00:29:20.44 --> 00:29:21.44
Yeah.

630
00:29:21.44 --> 00:29:24.40
But at the same time, it's like, it is protected.

631
00:29:24.40 --> 00:29:26.72
Like, that's what he's dealing with here.

632
00:29:26.72 --> 00:29:27.72
Yeah.

633
00:29:27.72 --> 00:29:28.72
That's what he's talking about here.

634
00:29:28.72 --> 00:29:33.96
And it's the same thing, you know, with these big IEDs that the enemy makes where you

635
00:29:33.96 --> 00:29:35.04
think, hey, I'm protected.

636
00:29:35.04 --> 00:29:43.32
I'm going to tank, but one of those big giant IEDs can do some damage.

637
00:29:43.32 --> 00:29:48.20
Next armored battles against infantry and anti tanks are short and violent.

638
00:29:48.20 --> 00:29:54.04
They take great strength in mind, and both physical and moral courage, because of this

639
00:29:54.04 --> 00:29:58.24
violence and the speed with which they are terminated.

640
00:29:58.24 --> 00:30:05.000
And once launched tanks must closed at their best speed, just the same as infantry, and also

641
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.64
just the same as infantry, they must fire while closing.

642
00:30:14.64 --> 00:30:23.36
Next, every effort must be made to attack the flank, or preferably the rear of the enemy.

643
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:27.48
In executing such an attack, we must use all means that our command to prevent the enemy

644
00:30:27.48 --> 00:30:29.88
from stopping these turning movements.

645
00:30:29.88 --> 00:30:35.80
So this is exactly what I was talking about.

646
00:30:35.80 --> 00:30:39.96
Think about this, every effort must be made to attack the flank, or preferably the rear

647
00:30:39.96 --> 00:30:40.96
of the enemy.

648
00:30:40.96 --> 00:30:41.96
That's brilliant.

649
00:30:41.96 --> 00:30:43.80
I talked about this all the time.

650
00:30:43.80 --> 00:30:49.52
You don't want to attack your enemy head on, you want to attack them from the flank, right?

651
00:30:49.52 --> 00:30:51.52
Clearly he understood that.

652
00:30:51.52 --> 00:30:59.64
However, you can look at his history, and he would attack his superiors, his people

653
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:04.36
are out, you know, the people's peers, he would attack them instead of developing a relationship

654
00:31:04.36 --> 00:31:08.68
instead of coming from the flank, and it ended up putting him in a position where he

655
00:31:08.68 --> 00:31:13.04
didn't get the final command that he wanted to get.

656
00:31:13.04 --> 00:31:24.44
So yes, my goal is to think about patting from a tactical perspective and then take it

657
00:31:24.44 --> 00:31:30.92
one step further and apply his battlefield tactics to leadership.

658
00:31:30.92 --> 00:31:38.20
And I wish he would have done that.

659
00:31:38.20 --> 00:31:42.08
Here he says to summarize, and here's where he kind of r- I skipped a bunch of stuff, but

660
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:46.96
to summarize, we must take great and calculated risks in the use of armor, but we must

661
00:31:46.96 --> 00:31:53.20
not dive off the deep end without first determining whether this running pole is full of water.

662
00:31:53.20 --> 00:31:54.20
That's the dichotomy of leadership.

663
00:31:54.20 --> 00:31:59.52
Yes, you have to take risk, but no, you don't just jump in.

664
00:31:59.52 --> 00:32:00.68
This is a good one.

665
00:32:00.68 --> 00:32:04.72
You must never halt because some other unit is stuck.

666
00:32:04.72 --> 00:32:09.000
If you push on, you will release the pressure on the adjacent unit, and it will accompany

667
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.40
you.

668
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:13.08
That is really smart.

669
00:32:13.08 --> 00:32:18.24
Someone next to you gets bogged down and you stop to help them.

670
00:32:18.24 --> 00:32:20.92
And now you're going to get bogged down until.

671
00:32:20.92 --> 00:32:23.28
So don't do that.

672
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:29.36
This was Dean Ladd going into Taurua.

673
00:32:29.36 --> 00:32:34.76
And the order was for all the Marines, if someone gets hit, keep going.

674
00:32:34.76 --> 00:32:36.32
That's what we need to do.

675
00:32:36.32 --> 00:32:42.64
And thankfully, for Dean Ladd, his men didn't obey that order, but if everyone didn't obey

676
00:32:42.64 --> 00:32:47.32
that order on that day, they never would have made it to the beach.

677
00:32:47.32 --> 00:32:49.52
So that's not just a one-on-one.

678
00:32:49.52 --> 00:32:54.20
That's the same with units as well.

679
00:32:54.20 --> 00:33:03.80
Next troops are never defeated by casualties, but by lack of resolution of guts.

680
00:33:03.80 --> 00:33:12.20
Girls are won by a few brave men who refuse to fear and push on.

681
00:33:12.20 --> 00:33:18.20
It should be our ambition, our ambition to be members of this heroic group.

682
00:33:18.20 --> 00:33:21.92
So you're never going to lose a battle because of casualties, you're going to lose because

683
00:33:21.92 --> 00:33:25.16
of lack of resolution of guts.

684
00:33:25.16 --> 00:33:31.24
More casualties occur among those who halt or go to the rear than among those who advance

685
00:33:31.24 --> 00:33:32.84
and advance firing.

686
00:33:32.84 --> 00:33:34.40
That's default aggressive.

687
00:33:34.40 --> 00:33:35.76
We're not going to run back.

688
00:33:35.76 --> 00:33:36.76
We're not going to stop.

689
00:33:36.76 --> 00:33:39.72
We're going to be default aggressive and keep maneuvering.

690
00:33:39.72 --> 00:33:46.12
Finally, all of us must have a desperate desire and determination to close with the enemy

691
00:33:46.12 --> 00:33:49.16
and to destroy them.

692
00:33:49.16 --> 00:33:50.72
Desperate desire.

693
00:33:50.72 --> 00:33:54.84
I kind of just breeze through those words, but think about what those words mean.

694
00:33:54.84 --> 00:34:00.16
A desperate desire and determination to close with the enemy and destroy them.

695
00:34:00.16 --> 00:34:04.40
Boom.

696
00:34:04.40 --> 00:34:10.24
He's got a little section here called common tactical faults.

697
00:34:10.24 --> 00:34:14.56
It is nearly always a mistake to occupy obvious cover.

698
00:34:14.56 --> 00:34:19.12
This is particularly true in sparsely wooded country because the woods are clearly marked

699
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:27.24
on maps and in the enemy possession and they will almost invariably be subject of concentration.

700
00:34:27.24 --> 00:34:31.16
You each to see this run out of training, we put guys out on reconnaissance and they're

701
00:34:31.16 --> 00:34:35.40
doing a reconnaissance of some target.

702
00:34:35.40 --> 00:34:43.84
If there was you look up at like a hillside and there's like one little group of shrubs,

703
00:34:43.84 --> 00:34:48.80
you can take your opposing force guys and go, hey, go check out those shrubs and there's

704
00:34:48.80 --> 00:34:51.40
like a 60% chance.

705
00:34:51.40 --> 00:34:56.80
There's the little seal squad or little seal fire team sitting in there with a camera.

706
00:34:56.80 --> 00:35:01.24
You just walk up there and see, big surprise.

707
00:35:01.24 --> 00:35:07.84
There was three outcroppings of brush and you're in one of them, what a surprise.

708
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:10.08
So that's what he's saying here.

709
00:35:10.08 --> 00:35:14.12
Don't take the obvious cover.

710
00:35:14.12 --> 00:35:17.76
When the fire starts, bayonets should be fixed.

711
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:21.68
They encourage our soldiers and discurs the enemy.

712
00:35:21.68 --> 00:35:28.000
In a platoon or any other commander moves to the front to reconnoiter during a firefight,

713
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.48
he must not move to the rear to disseminate information he is acquired, but rather the

714
00:35:33.48 --> 00:35:36.24
unit must come up to him.

715
00:35:36.24 --> 00:35:39.24
The site of officers moving to the rear has a disturbing effect on the troops and serves

716
00:35:39.24 --> 00:35:40.72
no useful purpose.

717
00:35:40.72 --> 00:35:43.56
That's a brilliant little thing to think about.

718
00:35:43.56 --> 00:35:48.60
Hey, I'm going to go up and find out what's going on in 40 minutes, send someone to

719
00:35:48.60 --> 00:35:51.48
this location and I'll tell you what's going on.

720
00:35:51.48 --> 00:36:00.72
Next, and again, skipping a bunch, but these are the key points.

721
00:36:00.72 --> 00:36:05.16
There is a ridiculous and widespread fear among all our troops that they will run out of

722
00:36:05.16 --> 00:36:08.60
ammunition, particularly small arms ammunition.

723
00:36:08.60 --> 00:36:12.20
If my, in my experience, this has never happened.

724
00:36:12.20 --> 00:36:16.000
Troops should remember that if they save ammunition, which they could have effectively

725
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.92
suspended against the enemy for some unforeseen contingency, they will also save the lives

726
00:36:21.92 --> 00:36:27.04
of a number of enemy who will participate in the contingency.

727
00:36:27.04 --> 00:36:29.24
So he's saying, get some.

728
00:36:29.24 --> 00:36:36.32
I can tell you that guys in Ramadi ran out of ammunition, even though he may not have experienced

729
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:37.52
it happened.

730
00:36:37.52 --> 00:36:40.52
It happens.

731
00:36:40.52 --> 00:36:46.84
That little story I've told before about Mikey Montsour making this video.

732
00:36:46.84 --> 00:36:47.84
Yeah.

733
00:36:47.84 --> 00:36:49.84
And me showing up and everyone's saying, go watch Mikey's video.

734
00:36:49.84 --> 00:36:54.84
And I'm like, cool, I go watch Mikey's video and then Tim going in the moon.

735
00:36:54.84 --> 00:37:00.52
And he shows it to me and of course, on Mr. serious.

736
00:37:00.52 --> 00:37:03.80
And I say, Mikey, there's a firefake going on.

737
00:37:03.80 --> 00:37:05.84
What are you doing taking a video?

738
00:37:05.84 --> 00:37:08.000
And he's like, I was like, just a surfer.

739
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I was like, cool, you're not at home.

740
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.16
Guess, guess, makes a video.

741
00:37:13.16 --> 00:37:16.04
But yes, you can't run out of ammunition.

742
00:37:16.04 --> 00:37:21.92
So maybe not 100% really with that on that one.

743
00:37:21.92 --> 00:37:27.24
The necessity for using all weapons to their maximum fire capacity during our attacks cannot

744
00:37:27.24 --> 00:37:30.04
be too strongly impressed on the soldiers.

745
00:37:30.04 --> 00:37:32.96
And he gun that is not firing is not doing its job.

746
00:37:32.96 --> 00:37:38.48
And the assault we're marching fires used by infantry every gun machine gun and mortar must

747
00:37:38.48 --> 00:37:39.48
fire.

748
00:37:39.48 --> 00:37:42.04
So yeah, I mean, that's what he's talking about.

749
00:37:42.04 --> 00:37:48.08
I think even to the previous point, he's talking about these assaults where you have

750
00:37:48.08 --> 00:37:50.48
a massive logistics train right behind you.

751
00:37:50.48 --> 00:37:54.000
So you're not, you should really shouldn't run out of ammunition.

752
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.32
Unlike what we were doing where you might not have logistics train right there behind

753
00:37:59.32 --> 00:38:04.68
you, you might have to be kind of stuck out the city somewhere for a little while.

754
00:38:04.68 --> 00:38:07.80
So yeah, get some with the guns.

755
00:38:07.80 --> 00:38:12.44
At the close of a fight is very desirable that our own dead be removed from view is rapidly

756
00:38:12.44 --> 00:38:13.44
as possible.

757
00:38:13.44 --> 00:38:17.16
After this has been accomplished, the enemy dead should be removed with the same reverence

758
00:38:17.16 --> 00:38:22.48
we accord our own and given a proper burial.

759
00:38:22.48 --> 00:38:27.72
Next there is a regrettable tendency on the part of company officers and non-commission

760
00:38:27.72 --> 00:38:33.64
officers to accompany the firing line as if they were members on a well-trained chorus

761
00:38:33.64 --> 00:38:36.96
simply keeping position.

762
00:38:36.96 --> 00:38:41.28
This attitude of mind and the actions resulting from it is impossible in battle.

763
00:38:41.28 --> 00:38:46.56
Officers and non-commission officers are there for the purpose of seeing that all the weapons

764
00:38:46.56 --> 00:38:49.20
of their respective little commands are functioning.

765
00:38:49.20 --> 00:38:53.96
They cannot see this by simply accompanying the movement.

766
00:38:53.96 --> 00:38:56.08
They must direct it.

767
00:38:56.08 --> 00:39:06.68
This is the thing about this that I think of and I've talked about this before with

768
00:39:06.68 --> 00:39:12.88
Stoner Seth Stone who was the Delta Patum Commander in Task and Abuser and him want

769
00:39:12.88 --> 00:39:17.52
to him staying exactly where he was supposed to stay according to the standard operating

770
00:39:17.52 --> 00:39:22.40
procedures while executing maneuvers on the battlefield.

771
00:39:22.40 --> 00:39:27.72
There's a pre-determined place where everyone is supposed to be.

772
00:39:27.72 --> 00:39:31.80
I was watching him, he'd be in the perfect pre-determined place but the pre-determined place

773
00:39:31.80 --> 00:39:35.52
that you're in doesn't always allow you to see what you need to see as the leader.

774
00:39:35.52 --> 00:39:41.20
You actually just because that's the standard operating procedure, there are deviations

775
00:39:41.20 --> 00:39:44.96
that you can make and that you need to make as the leader to make sure that you can see

776
00:39:44.96 --> 00:39:48.04
what's going on, you can see with the next maneuver's supposed to be.

777
00:39:48.04 --> 00:39:51.04
That's sort of what he's talking about here.

778
00:39:51.04 --> 00:39:53.80
What he's saying is you aren't just going along with the movement.

779
00:39:53.80 --> 00:39:56.44
You gotta make it happen to the same thing I was saying Stoner like, hey, once the call

780
00:39:56.44 --> 00:39:59.80
gets made, it's not just they're going to execute it, you got to direct it, you got

781
00:39:59.80 --> 00:40:05.84
to get a control of it and make it go to the right place.

782
00:40:05.84 --> 00:40:14.96
Then he says this key point in this letter as in those proceeding it, I am not laying

783
00:40:14.96 --> 00:40:21.28
down inflexible rules, I am simply giving you my ideas.

784
00:40:21.28 --> 00:40:25.84
Even this guy who thinks that he's so smart and thinks that all of his military intuitions

785
00:40:25.84 --> 00:40:32.24
are 100% correct and will be proven out in history to be the right call.

786
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:37.64
Even this guy is saying, listen, I'm not laying down like things that you can't adapt

787
00:40:37.64 --> 00:40:40.40
from, I'm just giving you what my ideas are.

788
00:40:40.40 --> 00:40:45.60
Then he says, I must and do trust your military experience, courage and loyalty to make

789
00:40:45.60 --> 00:40:48.08
these ideas tangible.

790
00:40:48.08 --> 00:40:53.12
There are many ways of fighting, all of which are good if they are successful.

791
00:40:53.12 --> 00:40:57.80
So even the great, what's that word, bump to us?

792
00:40:57.80 --> 00:40:58.80
Yes.

793
00:40:58.80 --> 00:41:03.24
General Patton is saying, I know I told you like, I'm right all the time, but do what

794
00:41:03.24 --> 00:41:05.04
you gotta do.

795
00:41:05.04 --> 00:41:09.80
These aren't inflexible rules, do what you gotta do.

796
00:41:09.80 --> 00:41:12.12
He wraps this one up.

797
00:41:12.12 --> 00:41:16.12
We are now entering the final stage of a great war of a great victory.

798
00:41:16.12 --> 00:41:25.84
This victory can be obtained by the maximum use of all weapons, both physical and spiritual.

799
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:29.80
It is the duty of all commanders to see that they're mannerfully aware of the many

800
00:41:29.80 --> 00:41:36.48
vile deeds perpetrated upon civilisation by the Germans and that they attack with the utmost

801
00:41:36.48 --> 00:41:42.64
determined, determination, ferocity and hate.

802
00:41:42.64 --> 00:41:47.04
I am sure that every man will do his duty and I am there for sure that victory is simply

803
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:50.64
a question of when we find the enemy.

804
00:41:50.64 --> 00:41:54.92
So it's interesting that he's actually telling them, you need to attack with hate.

805
00:41:54.92 --> 00:41:56.76
It's a different level.

806
00:41:56.76 --> 00:41:58.48
This is total war.

807
00:41:58.48 --> 00:42:03.48
This isn't like, oh well, you know, attack with some dislike.

808
00:42:03.48 --> 00:42:04.48
No.

809
00:42:04.48 --> 00:42:07.44
We're going to attack with hate.

810
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:08.76
And that's how he wraps up.

811
00:42:08.76 --> 00:42:10.64
That was a letter of instruction number three.

812
00:42:10.64 --> 00:42:13.72
This is letter of instruction number four.

813
00:42:13.72 --> 00:42:17.04
Now they're starting to make some adjustments.

814
00:42:17.04 --> 00:42:21.84
He says the acute supply situation confronting us has caused the Supreme Commander to

815
00:42:21.84 --> 00:42:26.68
direct that until further orders the third army with its supporting troops and those elements

816
00:42:26.68 --> 00:42:33.52
of the 9th army placed in the line will assume the defensive.

817
00:42:33.52 --> 00:42:36.28
Which he knows he doesn't really like very much being on defensive.

818
00:42:36.28 --> 00:42:40.52
It is evident that the successful accomplishment of this mission will require particular

819
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:42.68
concentration upon two points.

820
00:42:42.68 --> 00:42:48.12
First, this change in attitude on our part must be completely concealed from the enemy who

821
00:42:48.12 --> 00:42:53.52
should he learn of it would certainly move troops to our front and oppose other allied

822
00:42:53.52 --> 00:42:54.52
armies.

823
00:42:54.52 --> 00:42:57.76
So he's saying, look, we can't let them know that we're going on the defensive because

824
00:42:57.76 --> 00:43:02.84
then they'll just, you know, back off and go attack somewhere else.

825
00:43:02.84 --> 00:43:06.76
And he says second, we must be in possession of a suitable line of departure so that we

826
00:43:06.76 --> 00:43:11.72
can move rapidly when the Supreme Commander directs us to resume the offensive.

827
00:43:11.72 --> 00:43:16.44
And then he says in order to carry out the requirements of paragraph 2A, which is the one

828
00:43:16.44 --> 00:43:19.76
I just read, we will not dig in.

829
00:43:19.76 --> 00:43:26.40
Wire or mine, but we will utilize a thin outpost zone back that suitable places by a powerful

830
00:43:26.40 --> 00:43:27.88
mobile reserves.

831
00:43:27.88 --> 00:43:32.36
We will further ensure that all possible avenues of tank attack are registered in all of

832
00:43:32.36 --> 00:43:39.20
our batteries whose guns can bear counterattacks by our mobile reserves should be planned

833
00:43:39.20 --> 00:43:43.64
and executed to secure a double development of the hostile effort with the purpose of not

834
00:43:43.64 --> 00:43:46.76
only defeating it, but destroying it.

835
00:43:46.76 --> 00:43:53.88
So that's pretty what he's saying is it's kind of the same strategy that the Russians

836
00:43:53.88 --> 00:43:58.04
take when people attack Russia, which is look, we got a little line of defense when we

837
00:43:58.04 --> 00:44:02.76
get attacked, we're going to back in a little bit, back off a little bit, and then back

838
00:44:02.76 --> 00:44:05.52
off a little bit more, and then they attack it and back off a little bit more.

839
00:44:05.52 --> 00:44:08.88
And then when the time is right, we'll surround them and destroy them all.

840
00:44:08.88 --> 00:44:09.88
That's what he's saying.

841
00:44:09.88 --> 00:44:11.92
But he's saying look, that's why we don't have to dig in.

842
00:44:11.92 --> 00:44:15.44
We're putting a thin line of defense out there and then we're going to attack, we'll just

843
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:16.44
back up.

844
00:44:16.44 --> 00:44:20.08
We got strong defense further back, but we're just going to back up, we're going to lower

845
00:44:20.08 --> 00:44:26.16
the enemy in and then we're going to envelop them.

846
00:44:26.16 --> 00:44:27.16
Very.

847
00:44:27.16 --> 00:44:28.16
Simple.

848
00:44:28.16 --> 00:44:33.48
The other thing that's good about it is when you're not dug in as soon as you get

849
00:44:33.48 --> 00:44:37.76
the order to attack, boom, we're going on the attack because we're not dug in, which

850
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:43.28
is again something I talked about, leaders from strategy and tactics, which I wish, the

851
00:44:43.28 --> 00:44:45.48
patent would have read my chapter.

852
00:44:45.48 --> 00:44:47.48
Sorry.

853
00:44:47.48 --> 00:44:52.44
Speaking of ego, there you go, revealed.

854
00:44:52.44 --> 00:44:59.000
I wish Paton read my chapter about don't dig in because how often did Paton think, hey,

855
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.96
this is how we should do something and when he didn't, when he got told another way instead

856
00:45:03.96 --> 00:45:07.36
of saying, okay, I understand, okay, we'll go for it.

857
00:45:07.36 --> 00:45:08.36
It was resistance.

858
00:45:08.36 --> 00:45:09.84
It was okay, we'll do it.

859
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:11.36
But he didn't like it.

860
00:45:11.36 --> 00:45:14.48
I need to let that be known.

861
00:45:14.48 --> 00:45:17.000
Which again, look, I get it.

862
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.28
Oh, I'm not going to do it.

863
00:45:18.28 --> 00:45:20.20
Somebody tells me to do if I don't agree with it.

864
00:45:20.20 --> 00:45:22.000
No, I'm not saying that.

865
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.20
And there's time, we've doesn't make any sense whatsoever cool.

866
00:45:25.20 --> 00:45:28.64
You know, then maybe there is a time we draw a line in the sand.

867
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:32.92
But these were big giant operations where it's like, okay, we do it like this.

868
00:45:32.92 --> 00:45:33.92
We do it like that.

869
00:45:33.92 --> 00:45:35.28
No, we should do it my way.

870
00:45:35.28 --> 00:45:37.20
And so much resistance.

871
00:45:37.20 --> 00:45:41.52
And you're going to end up doing it anyways, by the way, that he just didn't develop

872
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:45.12
the kind of relationship that he needed and he didn't gain the kind of trust that he needed

873
00:45:45.12 --> 00:45:48.44
up the chain of command where they put him in, to see in your positions where he could

874
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:49.84
have had even more impact.

875
00:45:49.84 --> 00:45:53.20
Oh, yeah, don't dig in.

876
00:45:53.20 --> 00:45:56.16
Don't dig in around your ideas.

877
00:45:56.16 --> 00:46:00.96
Don't dig in even on the defense sometimes.

878
00:46:00.96 --> 00:46:06.40
Which I hesitate to say, let me just make this note.

879
00:46:06.40 --> 00:46:11.44
If you're in a truly defensive position, dig in because the enemy is going to attack you

880
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:16.88
and you don't want to be, you want to have a place that you can get good covered from the enemy

881
00:46:16.88 --> 00:46:17.88
attack.

882
00:46:17.88 --> 00:46:20.72
I'm not saying never dig in.

883
00:46:20.72 --> 00:46:23.76
I'm saying most of the time don't dig in.

884
00:46:23.76 --> 00:46:30.12
All right, now this next section is from something that Pat wrote.

885
00:46:30.12 --> 00:46:36.60
I want to say you wrote it in 1924, 26, something like that.

886
00:46:36.60 --> 00:46:39.72
But we've been way before World War II.

887
00:46:39.72 --> 00:46:43.40
But it was after he got done with World War I.

888
00:46:43.40 --> 00:46:45.28
And once again, not reading the whole thing.

889
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:53.84
But I think the name of this essay, we'll call it by General Patton, was the secret of

890
00:46:53.84 --> 00:46:58.36
victory.

891
00:46:58.36 --> 00:47:04.56
And this is where you kind of start to realize that Patton was a really smart and educated

892
00:47:04.56 --> 00:47:10.88
individual because he's a very eloquent writer, especially for a guy that swore so much.

893
00:47:10.88 --> 00:47:20.72
But very eloquent writer, and we'll go to this here, despite the years of fought and

894
00:47:20.72 --> 00:47:31.04
oceans of ink which have been devoted to the elicidation of war, its secrets still remain

895
00:47:31.04 --> 00:47:34.32
shrouded in mystery.

896
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:41.44
Indeed, it is due largely to the very volume of available information that the veil is so

897
00:47:41.44 --> 00:47:42.44
thick.

898
00:47:42.44 --> 00:47:46.04
So everyone's been trying to figure out war for a long time.

899
00:47:46.04 --> 00:47:49.32
And because so many people have written about it, that's what makes it hard, it's one

900
00:47:49.32 --> 00:47:52.96
of the things that makes it hard to understand is that so much stuff has been written about

901
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:54.76
it.

902
00:47:54.76 --> 00:47:59.04
And by the way, that whole opening letter to George, like we could have just broken that entire

903
00:47:59.04 --> 00:48:00.04
thing down.

904
00:48:00.04 --> 00:48:01.04
Maybe we should have.

905
00:48:01.04 --> 00:48:05.88
He's talking about you need to read history.

906
00:48:05.88 --> 00:48:08.28
So he goes on here.

907
00:48:08.28 --> 00:48:16.84
War isn't art and as such is not susceptible of explanation by fixed formulae.

908
00:48:16.84 --> 00:48:21.76
So wars, this crazy thing, and it's, you can't just say, okay, this is what war is.

909
00:48:21.76 --> 00:48:22.76
No, it's an art.

910
00:48:22.76 --> 00:48:25.48
It's like trying to explain art.

911
00:48:25.48 --> 00:48:26.48
Can you explain art?

912
00:48:26.48 --> 00:48:29.60
Can you explain why someone likes this painting, but not that painting, but the other person

913
00:48:29.60 --> 00:48:32.48
likes that painting, but not this painting, you can't explain that.

914
00:48:32.48 --> 00:48:36.28
You can't explain why you universally, most people like this painting.

915
00:48:36.28 --> 00:48:38.88
You universally, most people like this song, right?

916
00:48:38.88 --> 00:48:40.32
You can't explain that.

917
00:48:40.32 --> 00:48:43.36
Otherwise guess what, people would just go, oh, go, I need to make a hit and song.

918
00:48:43.36 --> 00:48:44.76
No, I'll just produce one.

919
00:48:44.76 --> 00:48:47.04
The formulae formulae.

920
00:48:47.04 --> 00:48:53.16
No one can describe what makes a good video because the echo charts you're here.

921
00:48:53.16 --> 00:48:54.16
Sure.

922
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:56.20
Now, this is something you are cleared hot to talk about, right?

923
00:48:56.20 --> 00:48:57.20
Okay.

924
00:48:57.20 --> 00:48:59.56
A little bit more than weapons load out.

925
00:48:59.56 --> 00:49:00.56
Probably.

926
00:49:00.56 --> 00:49:06.56
So, if it was, hey, we just need to make a good video and it'll go viral.

927
00:49:06.56 --> 00:49:07.56
That's the answer.

928
00:49:07.56 --> 00:49:08.56
Right, cool.

929
00:49:08.56 --> 00:49:09.56
Hey, echo, go make a viral video.

930
00:49:09.56 --> 00:49:10.56
Do it with your favorite.

931
00:49:10.56 --> 00:49:11.56
Just go make a viral video.

932
00:49:11.56 --> 00:49:12.56
You can't do it.

933
00:49:12.56 --> 00:49:13.56
You can't do it.

934
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:17.56
Yeah, actually, that's a good comparison because there's so, and especially now, and probably

935
00:49:17.56 --> 00:49:21.72
more in the future, where there's going to be a lot of information, or a lot of people

936
00:49:21.72 --> 00:49:26.56
start writing about it, or write more about it about what makes a viral video.

937
00:49:26.56 --> 00:49:27.56
That's like perfect.

938
00:49:27.56 --> 00:49:31.56
Yeah, it's a more perfect thing because everybody wants to make a viral video.

939
00:49:31.56 --> 00:49:32.56
Oh, yeah.

940
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:36.56
That's the, I mean, everybody wants to make a viral video, but you can't just open up

941
00:49:36.56 --> 00:49:38.72
the formula and say, okay, cool.

942
00:49:38.72 --> 00:49:42.56
What we need to do is need to be 38 seconds long and you have this type of soundtrack

943
00:49:42.56 --> 00:49:45.56
and you have this type of visuals and this type of voice over.

944
00:49:45.56 --> 00:49:46.56
Good.

945
00:49:46.56 --> 00:49:47.56
Okay, produce it.

946
00:49:47.56 --> 00:49:48.56
Boom.

947
00:49:48.56 --> 00:49:49.56
Do it.

948
00:49:49.56 --> 00:49:50.56
Gangman style.

949
00:49:50.56 --> 00:49:51.56
Oh, whatever that one.

950
00:49:51.56 --> 00:49:53.56
And got your style.

951
00:49:53.56 --> 00:49:56.56
How did that end up being one of the most, it might be the most.

952
00:49:56.56 --> 00:49:59.56
It might be the most viewed video of all time, right?

953
00:49:59.56 --> 00:50:00.56
I don't know.

954
00:50:00.56 --> 00:50:01.56
But it's up there.

955
00:50:01.56 --> 00:50:02.56
We know that.

956
00:50:02.56 --> 00:50:07.56
I know for at least three months of time, my little kids between the ages of whatever they were,

957
00:50:07.56 --> 00:50:12.56
six and eight were walking around the house, singing Gangnam style.

958
00:50:12.56 --> 00:50:13.56
Yes, there.

959
00:50:13.56 --> 00:50:14.56
Yeah.

960
00:50:14.56 --> 00:50:16.56
And I'm saying, haven't, wait, hold on.

961
00:50:16.56 --> 00:50:18.56
Let me play Blacks' App is for you, please.

962
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:19.56
Yeah.

963
00:50:19.56 --> 00:50:20.56
Yeah.

964
00:50:20.56 --> 00:50:25.56
And even when people do do to make the formula, it's like super ambiguous.

965
00:50:25.56 --> 00:50:26.56
And guess what?

966
00:50:26.56 --> 00:50:27.56
That same guy?

967
00:50:27.56 --> 00:50:28.56
There.

968
00:50:28.56 --> 00:50:29.56
Okay.

969
00:50:29.56 --> 00:50:31.56
Well, we've made Gangnam style.

970
00:50:31.56 --> 00:50:32.56
Just making another one.

971
00:50:32.56 --> 00:50:33.56
Yeah.

972
00:50:33.56 --> 00:50:34.56
No.

973
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:35.56
I don't even think there was another one.

974
00:50:35.56 --> 00:50:36.56
Yeah.

975
00:50:36.56 --> 00:50:37.56
Yeah.

976
00:50:37.56 --> 00:50:37.56
There.

977
00:50:37.56 --> 00:50:38.56
I mean, that's like a group, right?

978
00:50:38.56 --> 00:50:40.56
I think that's like a music group.

979
00:50:40.56 --> 00:50:41.56
See, we don't even know.

980
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:42.56
Yeah.

981
00:50:42.56 --> 00:50:43.56
Yeah.

982
00:50:43.56 --> 00:50:44.56
That's the kind of point of view.

983
00:50:44.56 --> 00:50:45.56
No, it's like guy.

984
00:50:45.56 --> 00:50:46.56
Yeah.

985
00:50:46.56 --> 00:50:47.56
But he's like, yeah.

986
00:50:47.56 --> 00:50:48.56
Yeah.

987
00:50:48.56 --> 00:50:49.56
Artists.

988
00:50:49.56 --> 00:50:52.56
He's like, you as a legit, like, pop guy.

989
00:50:52.56 --> 00:50:53.56
Yeah.

990
00:50:53.56 --> 00:50:54.56
Yeah.

991
00:50:54.56 --> 00:50:55.56
He made that song.

992
00:50:55.56 --> 00:50:58.56
But then he tried to make another one.

993
00:50:58.56 --> 00:51:00.56
And it wasn't, you know, you just can't.

994
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:01.56
He didn't.

995
00:51:01.56 --> 00:51:02.56
There's no form.

996
00:51:02.56 --> 00:51:03.56
Yeah.

997
00:51:03.56 --> 00:51:04.56
Same thing with war.

998
00:51:04.56 --> 00:51:06.56
And here we go back to the book, away from Gangnam style.

999
00:51:06.56 --> 00:51:08.56
We're going back to the book.

1000
00:51:08.56 --> 00:51:09.56
Yeah.

1001
00:51:09.56 --> 00:51:16.20
From the earliest time, there has been an unending effort to subject its complex and emotional

1002
00:51:16.20 --> 00:51:24.04
structure to dissection, to an unseated rules for its waging, to make tangible its

1003
00:51:24.04 --> 00:51:25.04
indangibility.

1004
00:51:25.04 --> 00:51:31.12
One might as well strive to isolate the soul by the dissection of the cadaver as to seek

1005
00:51:31.12 --> 00:51:36.40
the essence of war by the analysis of its records.

1006
00:51:36.40 --> 00:51:38.28
That's a pretty powerful, right?

1007
00:51:38.28 --> 00:51:43.12
You might as well in order to find out what makes war war, you, it's like looking for

1008
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:46.20
the soul in a body.

1009
00:51:46.20 --> 00:51:51.36
And then he says, yeah, despite the impossibility of physically detecting the soul, its

1010
00:51:51.36 --> 00:51:56.32
existence is proven by its tangible reflection in acts and thoughts.

1011
00:51:56.32 --> 00:51:59.36
So we know we exist.

1012
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:04.60
It's there, but you can't open up the body and find it.

1013
00:52:04.60 --> 00:52:13.52
So with war beyond its physical aspect of armed hosts, their hovers and impalpable something

1014
00:52:13.52 --> 00:52:21.56
which on occasion so dominates the material as to induce victory under circumstances quite

1015
00:52:21.56 --> 00:52:23.44
inexplicable.

1016
00:52:23.44 --> 00:52:29.92
So sometimes things happen in war that victory is achieved and no one can really even

1017
00:52:29.92 --> 00:52:36.64
understand how it's inexplicable.

1018
00:52:36.64 --> 00:52:43.000
He goes on the great warriors were too busy and often too inept to write contemporaneously

1019
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.68
of their exploits, saving the form of propagates, propagand reports, while what they later

1020
00:52:49.68 --> 00:52:57.60
put on paper as biographies were retro specs colored by their vein strivings for enhanced

1021
00:52:57.60 --> 00:53:00.88
fame or political conditions then confronting them.

1022
00:53:00.88 --> 00:53:05.44
So when these great warriors wrote, it was afterwards because they have time to do it

1023
00:53:05.44 --> 00:53:06.44
while they're fighting.

1024
00:53:06.44 --> 00:53:11.36
So afterwards and then they kind of got a little ego involved which here's, here's got general

1025
00:53:11.36 --> 00:53:14.88
pat and call them everyone out on their ego.

1026
00:53:14.88 --> 00:53:18.16
Or there's some political situation going on that's why they wrote it a certain way.

1027
00:53:18.16 --> 00:53:21.04
So you don't even get the truth from the warriors themselves because they don't have

1028
00:53:21.04 --> 00:53:27.04
time and or they do it afterwards in which case it's colored or should say miscullored

1029
00:53:27.04 --> 00:53:32.40
by their ego or the political environment that they're at.

1030
00:53:32.40 --> 00:53:36.40
With the efforts of historians, the case is even worse.

1031
00:53:36.40 --> 00:53:41.80
Those who write at the time are guilty of partisanship and the urge of hero worship.

1032
00:53:41.80 --> 00:53:45.64
So even some of that's a historian right now they got those problems.

1033
00:53:45.64 --> 00:53:50.04
In peace the scholar flourishes and war the soldier dies.

1034
00:53:50.04 --> 00:53:56.32
So it comes about that we view our soldiers through the eyes of scholars and attribute

1035
00:53:56.32 --> 00:54:01.000
to them scholarly virtues.

1036
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.84
So since it's the scholarly people telling it, they paint these people to be you know

1037
00:54:05.84 --> 00:54:10.84
scholarly and that's not always the case.

1038
00:54:10.84 --> 00:54:15.52
Seeking obvious reasons for the obscure we analyze their conduct as told by historians

1039
00:54:15.52 --> 00:54:18.20
and assign as reasons for their success.

1040
00:54:18.20 --> 00:54:20.40
A parent trivial things.

1041
00:54:20.40 --> 00:54:24.20
So we say look we we look at someone in the past who is a great warrior or a great leader

1042
00:54:24.20 --> 00:54:27.04
and we say okay they were a great leader because of this or because of that because that's

1043
00:54:27.04 --> 00:54:29.40
what some scholarly person wrote about.

1044
00:54:29.40 --> 00:54:40.48
Some of you'll things music has a myriad music has its myriad of musicians but only

1045
00:54:40.48 --> 00:54:43.000
it's dozen masters.

1046
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:51.96
So with painting sculpture literature medicine or trade or videos.

1047
00:54:51.96 --> 00:54:54.48
Many are called but few are chosen.

1048
00:54:54.48 --> 00:54:57.52
So that's what he's saying is that these leaders are the same way.

1049
00:54:57.52 --> 00:55:04.20
There's there's there's people that make music but these combat leaders there's not too

1050
00:55:04.20 --> 00:55:15.32
many of them that actually rate you know Beethoven or Tony Ayomi.

1051
00:55:15.32 --> 00:55:19.68
Nor can we concur wholly with the alluring stories in the advertising sections of our

1052
00:55:19.68 --> 00:55:25.44
magazine which ported point to the golden path of success to all and sundry who follow

1053
00:55:25.44 --> 00:55:31.04
that particular phase of home education that they happen to advocate.

1054
00:55:31.04 --> 00:55:36.04
So just like the get rich quicks game is not going to work these little thinking that these

1055
00:55:36.04 --> 00:55:43.44
little leadership things that you learn okay they're not really going to help you as much.

1056
00:55:43.44 --> 00:55:47.96
Knowledge is power but to a degree only.

1057
00:55:47.96 --> 00:55:53.000
Its possession per se will raise a man to mediocrity but not to distinction.

1058
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.80
So you can be smart you can learn a lot but that doesn't mean it.

1059
00:55:55.80 --> 00:55:57.80
Doesn't get you there.

1060
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:04.84
In art and the funny thing as you read this there's a whole this whole thing is a bug

1061
00:56:04.84 --> 00:56:10.04
and egotistical writing right because he said listen there's normal people and then

1062
00:56:10.04 --> 00:56:14.36
there's there's you can have knowledge that'll get you so far but to truly be the

1063
00:56:14.36 --> 00:56:17.52
master is pretty rare.

1064
00:56:17.52 --> 00:56:19.08
And it's he implying that he is.

1065
00:56:19.08 --> 00:56:24.60
You get that implication a little bit in our opinion indeed the instruction obtained from

1066
00:56:24.60 --> 00:56:31.32
such courses is of less moment to future success than his ambition which prompted the study.

1067
00:56:31.32 --> 00:56:34.80
That's interesting right so if you're a person that says hey I want to be a leader

1068
00:56:34.80 --> 00:56:37.64
I'm going to reach out and start trying to learn how to lead.

1069
00:56:37.64 --> 00:56:40.40
Is that ambition that's going to make you a leader or I want to make a lot of money so

1070
00:56:40.40 --> 00:56:44.16
I'm going to do this thing and that's going to make me a more money it's the ambition

1071
00:56:44.16 --> 00:56:50.24
is more important in making you actually successful than the course that you bought.

1072
00:56:50.24 --> 00:56:54.000
Hmm interesting.

1073
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.24
In considering these matters, sight should not be lost of the fact that while there is

1074
00:56:58.24 --> 00:57:02.80
much similarity there's also a vast difference between the successful soldier and the successful

1075
00:57:02.80 --> 00:57:07.92
man in other professions success due to knowledge and personality is the measure of ability

1076
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:09.88
in each case.

1077
00:57:09.88 --> 00:57:17.08
But to all accept the soldier it has vital significance only to the individual and to a limited

1078
00:57:17.08 --> 00:57:19.60
number of his family and associates.

1079
00:57:19.60 --> 00:57:25.52
So success is important when you look at any other profession it's important to be successful

1080
00:57:25.52 --> 00:57:28.36
because they person can take care of his associates and his family right.

1081
00:57:28.36 --> 00:57:32.80
So that's very important to be successful for your family and for your associates and

1082
00:57:32.80 --> 00:57:39.56
then he continues on while the soldier while with the soldier success or failure means infinitely

1083
00:57:39.56 --> 00:57:46.20
more as it must of necessity be measured not in terms of personal honor or affluence but

1084
00:57:46.20 --> 00:57:56.08
in the life happiness and honor of his men and his country.

1085
00:57:56.08 --> 00:58:03.56
Way heavier right and then let's face it you know that's kind of we hold military people

1086
00:58:03.56 --> 00:58:08.64
in high regards even though I mean you can find out you can go look you know what the

1087
00:58:08.64 --> 00:58:13.68
Admiral of the Navy makes the chief of naval operation makes you can go look it up he's

1088
00:58:13.68 --> 00:58:19.32
making whatever he's making like 113 thousand dollars a year you know what I mean and he's

1089
00:58:19.32 --> 00:58:24.64
in charge of billions of dollars worth of equipment whereas somebody that's in charge

1090
00:58:24.64 --> 00:58:31.28
of a medium size company is making probably 10 or 15 or 20 or even 100 times that's

1091
00:58:31.28 --> 00:58:36.12
probably 100 times more than what the chief of naval operation makes but we hold him

1092
00:58:36.12 --> 00:58:42.68
in high regard why because this guy isn't just protecting or taking care of you know

1093
00:58:42.68 --> 00:58:48.96
a company he's taken care of his troops and he's taking care of the country so that's

1094
00:58:48.96 --> 00:58:58.56
why being a military leader is held in high esteem right fully so you're not just

1095
00:58:58.56 --> 00:59:04.12
judging someone based on their amount of money that they make continue on hence the

1096
00:59:04.12 --> 00:59:12.20
search for that elusive secret of military success soul genius personality call it what

1097
00:59:12.20 --> 00:59:20.20
you will is a vital interest to all of us beyond question personal knowledge is a fine thing

1098
00:59:20.20 --> 00:59:27.16
but unfortunately it is too intimate when for example we recall a rail roll that railroad

1099
00:59:27.16 --> 00:59:33.08
accident the picture that most vividly presents itself to us is the severed blue gray

1100
00:59:33.08 --> 00:59:44.08
hand of some child victim not the misred signals which precipitated the tragedy so with

1101
00:59:44.08 --> 00:59:49.96
war experiences the choking gas that strangled us sticks in our memory to the more

1102
00:59:49.96 --> 00:59:53.84
less complete exclusion of the important fact that it was the roads and the

1103
00:59:53.84 --> 00:59:58.72
consequent abundant mechanical transportation peculiar to the western Europe

1104
00:59:58.72 --> 01:00:04.72
which permitted the accumulation of enough gas shells to do the strangling so we get

1105
01:00:04.72 --> 01:00:10.80
caught up looking at this one small outcome of the problem but we don't look at it

1106
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:19.48
from a strategic view we don't see the big picture he says a British writer has

1107
01:00:19.48 --> 01:00:23.80
said the characteristic of war and by the way I'm not reading this whole thing I'm

1108
01:00:23.80 --> 01:00:29.48
jumping through parts of it so there might be might sound a little bit disjoined

1109
01:00:29.48 --> 01:00:32.84
but it's not is disjoined when you're actually reading it he continues in

1110
01:00:32.84 --> 01:00:38.84
another little part here a British writer has said the characteristic of war is

1111
01:00:38.84 --> 01:00:47.84
its constant change of characteristic but as is ever the case with a morphism his

1112
01:00:47.84 --> 01:00:54.24
remark needs explanation and here's his explanation there is an incest and

1113
01:00:54.24 --> 01:01:00.52
constant change of means to attain the inevitable end but we must take care not

1114
01:01:00.52 --> 01:01:04.84
to let these inevitably sundry means past are predicted attain undue

1115
01:01:04.84 --> 01:01:08.60
eminence in the perspective of our minds so what is he saying there he's saying

1116
01:01:08.60 --> 01:01:14.88
you got you got these things that change about how we're gonna achieve some goal

1117
01:01:14.88 --> 01:01:21.64
and those things you can get caught up in those things they can attain undue

1118
01:01:21.64 --> 01:01:25.92
eminence so you can believe that they're more important and then he says

1119
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:32.12
since the beginning there has been an unending cycle of them and for each it's

1120
01:01:32.12 --> 01:01:36.28
advocates have claimed adoption as the soul means of successful war so all the

1121
01:01:36.28 --> 01:01:39.24
time new war this is the most important thing this is the most important thing

1122
01:01:39.24 --> 01:01:43.64
this is the most important thing and then he says yet the records of all time

1123
01:01:43.64 --> 01:01:48.56
show that the unchanging ends have been or and probably ever shall be the

1124
01:01:48.56 --> 01:01:54.40
securing of predominant force of the right sort at the right place at the

1125
01:01:54.40 --> 01:01:58.24
right time that's the most important thing you get the strongest force at the

1126
01:01:58.24 --> 01:02:00.80
right place at the right time that's how you win all these other things that

1127
01:02:00.80 --> 01:02:04.32
we're talking about they they're they're they're fake and again this is a

1128
01:02:04.32 --> 01:02:07.08
court in the pattern we could argue about those I'm telling you what he's saying

1129
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:12.80
is that the most important thing is to be that have the strongest force at the

1130
01:02:12.80 --> 01:02:22.16
right place at the right time it's hard argue with that yeah continuing on

1131
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:29.72
in this scholarly avocation soldiers of all important nations use at the

1132
01:02:29.72 --> 01:02:33.76
present time what purports to be the best mode of instruction the the

1133
01:02:33.76 --> 01:02:40.92
applicatory method the characteristics of some concrete problem are first

1134
01:02:40.92 --> 01:02:45.96
studied in the abstract and then tested by applying them with the assumed

1135
01:02:45.96 --> 01:02:53.52
forces and situations in in solving a nagleous problems either on the terrain

1136
01:02:53.52 --> 01:03:00.000
or a map representation of it so what he's saying there is the normal mode of

1137
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.64
instructions you look at a map you look at where you're gonna maneuver your

1138
01:03:02.64 --> 01:03:06.44
forces and then you figure out how you're going to apply your forces and you play

1139
01:03:06.44 --> 01:03:12.24
a little game of chess on a map or on a terrain model or even walking the

1140
01:03:12.24 --> 01:03:16.000
terrain actually physically doing it and then he says this so that makes sense

1141
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.72
right we understand that you're gonna look at this you know how to see how

1142
01:03:18.72 --> 01:03:23.28
you're gonna maneuver your pieces this method not only familiarizes the

1143
01:03:23.28 --> 01:03:27.24
student with all of the tools and technicalities of his trade but also develops

1144
01:03:27.24 --> 01:03:31.04
the aptitude for reaching decisions and the self assurance derived from

1145
01:03:31.04 --> 01:03:37.000
demonstrated achievement okay cool so by doing that by looking at a map by

1146
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.12
looking at terrain by going out and walking through the terrain by going out

1147
01:03:40.12 --> 01:03:43.44
and simulating combat you're gonna increase your what does he say you're self

1148
01:03:43.44 --> 01:03:46.88
assurance your aptitude for reaching decisions that's gonna happen it's gonna

1149
01:03:46.88 --> 01:03:52.76
make you better but then he says but at always as always there is a fly in the

1150
01:03:52.76 --> 01:04:01.04
ointment high academic performance demands infinite intimate knowledge of details

1151
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:07.44
and the qualities requisite to such attainments often inhabit bodies lacking

1152
01:04:07.44 --> 01:04:15.000
personality man that's a crazy thing to think about right that you got this

1153
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.08
people that are willing to study and willing to work but what they miss is they

1154
01:04:20.08 --> 01:04:25.24
don't have they they they don't have the personality they don't have the

1155
01:04:25.24 --> 01:04:28.44
charisma so they're smart the book smart right that's the term to get to use

1156
01:04:28.44 --> 01:04:34.000
this person here and that's a thing that comes out as a negative right someone

1157
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.40
says oh you know he's a really book smart they don't say that like oh he's super

1158
01:04:37.40 --> 01:04:44.64
book smart no that's who he's talking about people that are book smart and then

1159
01:04:44.64 --> 01:04:50.32
he says and also the striving for such knowledge often engenders the

1160
01:04:50.32 --> 01:04:55.96
felacious notion that capacity depends on the power to acquire such details

1161
01:04:55.96 --> 01:04:59.88
not the ability to apply them so you got someone over here that can memorize

1162
01:04:59.88 --> 01:05:02.76
what's in the book but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can take

1163
01:05:02.76 --> 01:05:08.88
what's in the book and apply it you notice that you did see right you get

1164
01:05:08.88 --> 01:05:14.32
someone that understands the move yeah but you got to know how to well look

1165
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:18.08
jjitsu is an interesting example because you can take someone and teach them the

1166
01:05:18.08 --> 01:05:21.48
move and you're gonna get it and they can achieve a good level but the people

1167
01:05:21.48 --> 01:05:24.88
that can go next level are the people that can take those things and apply them

1168
01:05:24.88 --> 01:05:29.16
in different ways different situations different scenarios and then create

1169
01:05:29.16 --> 01:05:34.84
things out of it that's the difference between or not even but up this is I

1170
01:05:34.84 --> 01:05:39.40
think someone can be just a good applyer and be a world champion in jjitsu

1171
01:05:39.40 --> 01:05:43.72
like someone that studies and is great and knows the moves they can be a world

1172
01:05:43.72 --> 01:05:50.52
champion but to be like the elite of the elite you got to have that next

1173
01:05:50.52 --> 01:05:54.64
level you got to be able to take those things and apply create next level yeah

1174
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:59.16
and not to skew the thing towards making videos or nothing like that that seems

1175
01:05:59.16 --> 01:06:03.88
to be the top and well you know but you see the end with a lot of stuff like

1176
01:06:03.88 --> 01:06:10.64
where do you see this with weapons as well sorry you're out of the

1177
01:06:10.64 --> 01:06:16.96
right when you know like sometimes and then you okay you saw you run to this on

1178
01:06:16.96 --> 01:06:19.92
YouTube where it's like okay you can look you can look up videos on how to make

1179
01:06:19.92 --> 01:06:24.12
videos right so and then so after a while you can kind of discern okay this

1180
01:06:24.12 --> 01:06:27.92
person just read the directions you know you know how you get that impression

1181
01:06:27.92 --> 01:06:31.36
from somebody and it doesn't matter you know necessarily video it can be a

1182
01:06:31.36 --> 01:06:34.12
lot of stuff when it's like you just get the impression that they read the

1183
01:06:34.12 --> 01:06:38.68
directions and they did a good that it clean perfect but you can sort of tell

1184
01:06:38.68 --> 01:06:42.76
versus the guy who's like maybe a little bit more creative with it or yep you

1185
01:06:42.76 --> 01:06:45.88
can you can tell they understand the cool comprehensive thing and then they

1186
01:06:45.88 --> 01:06:49.76
can add their own personal little element well the example that I use which I've

1187
01:06:49.76 --> 01:06:54.48
used before is you can take a flyer and put it up in a good-tarr center and

1188
01:06:54.48 --> 01:06:59.48
say hey I need someone that can play you can pick the most complicated songs

1189
01:06:59.48 --> 01:07:02.36
ever and there's you'll get 20 people that will call you up and they'll

1190
01:07:02.36 --> 01:07:06.20
actually be able to play those songs and yet they're all working regular

1191
01:07:06.20 --> 01:07:11.64
jobs because they didn't have that thing that creative thing they learned the

1192
01:07:11.64 --> 01:07:16.44
mechanics of the job but they couldn't they can't create something new no

1193
01:07:16.44 --> 01:07:22.000
offense I mean I wish I could play guitar like that I can't but that's what

1194
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.68
separates that's why that's why there's people that can are incredible musicians

1195
01:07:28.68 --> 01:07:33.80
guitarist technicians maybe musicians as a sort of just musicians imply that

1196
01:07:33.80 --> 01:07:39.24
they got that creative spark too I don't know that mean to me yeah I don't

1197
01:07:39.24 --> 01:07:43.88
know yeah maybe okay well you can put you out there yes or no I guess you've got

1198
01:07:43.88 --> 01:07:49.88
incredible technical musicians that can play any song on whatever instrument

1199
01:07:49.88 --> 01:07:54.60
but they don't have that little thing and that's what he's talking about their

1200
01:07:54.60 --> 01:07:59.96
book smart yeah what about you know you get these okay you know the old school art

1201
01:07:59.96 --> 01:08:04.68
right that real valuable art like you know Picasso and others then you have these

1202
01:08:04.68 --> 01:08:08.52
master foragers where are they on this whole thing

1203
01:08:08.52 --> 01:08:16.20
maybe like I mean I think they're like the technical guitarist that can

1204
01:08:16.20 --> 01:08:20.12
lay down the riff exactly you can't tell the difference but it doesn't really

1205
01:08:20.12 --> 01:08:23.64
matter because they can't create something new right if you're a master forger

1206
01:08:23.64 --> 01:08:27.96
that's great but you you're not going to be remembered because you didn't

1207
01:08:27.96 --> 01:08:33.40
create anything so creativity is what we're talking about here which again you know when

1208
01:08:33.40 --> 01:08:37.96
we went over the the Marine Corps manual tactics with Dave Burke like think about how

1209
01:08:37.96 --> 01:08:42.20
often they talked about creativity good to take yes good deal day think about how often

1210
01:08:42.20 --> 01:08:46.20
they talked about creativity yeah and I've been talking about since day one I think it was on

1211
01:08:46.20 --> 01:08:51.88
the first time I was on Tim Ferriss I said combat is an exercising creativity and it is and

1212
01:08:51.88 --> 01:08:58.44
that's what he's saying yeah for the master forger essentially will always have that

1213
01:08:58.44 --> 01:09:04.04
limitation no matter how good no matter you unless he can break out right and you know

1214
01:09:04.04 --> 01:09:09.56
what I thought you were going with this was like the modern art you know where it's just

1215
01:09:09.56 --> 01:09:13.72
some random thing and and you can look at it go well my four-year-old could have created that

1216
01:09:13.72 --> 01:09:17.32
right yes and then there's other people going away this second you're messing something here

1217
01:09:17.32 --> 01:09:22.60
that this is why this is creative this is why this is important whatever and what's interesting

1218
01:09:22.60 --> 01:09:29.64
also is when people when you when you when you're that good of an artist at drawing things

1219
01:09:30.44 --> 01:09:34.68
you have to get that good at drawing things realistically before you can break out and see them

1220
01:09:34.68 --> 01:09:39.40
from a different perspective I think I'm not a presenter yeah I don't know but don't I mean

1221
01:09:39.40 --> 01:09:42.92
not to say that that's not true but it's one of the things that Karri you're saying earlier there is no

1222
01:09:42.92 --> 01:09:49.24
formulae there even in evaluation of art really I mean we're all trained to understand

1223
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:55.40
this is a well-known critic of art but is there even such thing as a critic of art officially

1224
01:09:55.40 --> 01:10:02.36
yeah not really no and it's it's weird too because like with music there's music that is so

1225
01:10:02.36 --> 01:10:08.52
popular that I can't stand and most of the music that I like is not popular you know what does

1226
01:10:08.52 --> 01:10:17.16
that mean it's your special bro obviously I guess that art is in the eye of the holder in many cases

1227
01:10:17.16 --> 01:10:23.88
one might say yeah well yeah because some people they don't and maybe I misunderstood what you

1228
01:10:23.88 --> 01:10:29.08
meant when you said the artist has to be able to draw like yeah like good first right for the

1229
01:10:29.08 --> 01:10:33.32
breakup but a lot of artists I mean from what I understand they don't necessarily know how to

1230
01:10:33.32 --> 01:10:39.88
like draw that good it's more of just they're like the idea behind the result kind of thing

1231
01:10:40.44 --> 01:10:45.56
you know I don't know I'm not sure I think people just go first and they just go deeper in their head

1232
01:10:45.56 --> 01:10:50.76
and they're like hey you know the invoke like everything in them you know that's a good point too

1233
01:10:50.76 --> 01:10:58.36
because like with some of the old like punk rock bands that really like had a big impact

1234
01:10:58.36 --> 01:11:05.000
it wasn't because they were good musicians it's because their emotion emotionally raw right

1235
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.60
yeah they just people heard it went whoa this is this is a different thing and so that's you could

1236
01:11:12.60 --> 01:11:16.76
be you could be totally right and that's the same thing right you don't necessarily have to be a

1237
01:11:16.76 --> 01:11:22.04
fine artist before you start drawing crazy stuff right or drawing abstract stuff let's say

1238
01:11:22.04 --> 01:11:26.84
not necessarily true yeah follow in people even music like you know the guy

1239
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:33.000
super impressive where these guys like they may or may not even be a homeless guy but

1240
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.40
they're on the street oh yeah I got a bucket yeah and they're like shopping the bucket and

1241
01:11:37.40 --> 01:11:43.000
they're like doing all this stuff and it sounds really like dope but it's like I don't know

1242
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.24
like is it reaching everybody well definitely not reaching anybody everybody I posted

1243
01:11:47.24 --> 01:11:55.40
up there was some got there was like a bunch of bump of bumps I mean bumps in San Diego I was

1244
01:11:55.40 --> 01:12:05.000
out for dinner and they were playing bluegrass you ever seen someone with a it's like a

1245
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.84
like a broom pole or whatever a broom broom stick into like a upside down wash bin

1246
01:12:13.40 --> 01:12:21.16
with a string on it and it's a base okay well it's like what you'd see in the old days and then

1247
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:25.24
there's someone was plucking a banjo and someone else was playing guitar and these people

1248
01:12:25.24 --> 01:12:29.24
were clearly they were homeless people you know they were probably between the ages of

1249
01:12:30.44 --> 01:12:39.88
I would say maybe 20 to 20 to 26 so they're pretty young and and I was walking and I

1250
01:12:39.88 --> 01:12:43.16
had just heard them and I was thinking man this ban sounds good right and I get up and I see

1251
01:12:43.16 --> 01:12:50.12
they're just completely homeless and they were jamming and I actually posted it on Instagram

1252
01:12:50.12 --> 01:12:55.000
and you know when you got done it my son I was with my son and my son was like tell us guys

1253
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.44
we're good and I said yeah I know that was impressive and what does that mean that means

1254
01:13:02.44 --> 01:13:07.16
well your question was are they reaching everybody no they're not reaching anybody they're

1255
01:13:07.16 --> 01:13:12.44
reaching it literally four people were standing there watching them right so what's better so is

1256
01:13:12.44 --> 01:13:20.44
so okay I was having this debate it was a long time ago Tim Tim Ford so he was like saying

1257
01:13:20.44 --> 01:13:27.24
Tim but he was making music or whatever and he goes deep you know with his

1258
01:13:28.04 --> 01:13:34.52
music like what he's saying Derek's and something like whatever and he and so we're talking

1259
01:13:34.52 --> 01:13:40.12
about it like what's better music right and he's like oh like I think basically his premise was

1260
01:13:40.12 --> 01:13:45.48
underground rap is better than you know popular rap now and I had no dug in the fight but

1261
01:13:45.48 --> 01:13:51.24
we were just kind of more just taunting him a little bit and he was really emotionally dug in

1262
01:13:51.24 --> 01:13:56.60
on this one and and so I was like okay I was like well how do you prove that you know just because

1263
01:13:56.60 --> 01:14:00.92
you like it better doesn't mean overall it's better you got to be able to measure it so I'm like okay

1264
01:14:00.92 --> 01:14:07.16
so a little waned with the it was the song go DJ you heard that song go DJ anyway it's real popular

1265
01:14:07.16 --> 01:14:13.48
song at the time and I happened to like it and I was like no go DJ is better than all your underground

1266
01:14:13.48 --> 01:14:18.44
rap I just said it to trigger him I'm not saying that's a fact or nothing but but I used the

1267
01:14:18.44 --> 01:14:23.80
measurement tools like okay how many albums have you know you guys sold like or how are we going

1268
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:28.12
to measure you know and we couldn't really hit the net where he couldn't really hit the nail and

1269
01:14:28.12 --> 01:14:32.92
the head as to why it was better why underground rap is better you know but I sort of had

1270
01:14:32.92 --> 01:14:37.64
something like this than I'm because I had the measuring tool you know but at the end of the day

1271
01:14:37.64 --> 01:14:42.28
I think which I didn't say in the argument because you know it would have been kind of a cop out

1272
01:14:42.28 --> 01:14:48.20
given what we're doing there is no really way to tell that's what I'm saying it's like it's all

1273
01:14:48.20 --> 01:14:52.76
are just because it reaches just because a bunch of people I don't love go DJ that's not a

1274
01:14:52.76 --> 01:14:57.40
life changing song but if it's on like we're going to enjoy it then there's so there's that

1275
01:14:57.40 --> 01:15:01.80
side of the spectrum right like I don't know maybe what you're bringing spirit something like this you

1276
01:15:01.80 --> 01:15:07.40
know some of this thing pretty deep but whatever saying it's on this side of the spectrum

1277
01:15:07.40 --> 01:15:12.36
a lot of the time and then on the other side it's like I don't know something like super deep

1278
01:15:12.36 --> 01:15:17.56
that not many people know about but the people who do know about it it's like man that's my life

1279
01:15:17.56 --> 01:15:21.96
song kind of thing you know so it's a spectrum there but who's to say what's better you know well

1280
01:15:21.96 --> 01:15:30.12
yeah well I think I'm to say what's better you know where's you uh yeah so I guess the whole

1281
01:15:30.12 --> 01:15:37.24
point of this entire diverges that we've just taken is that just like in art and music there's a

1282
01:15:37.24 --> 01:15:46.28
spark that you have to have and it's the same thing with leadership and so now he continues on with

1283
01:15:46.28 --> 01:15:51.56
this thing that the people that they that the more that they learn the more that they learn from the

1284
01:15:51.56 --> 01:15:56.44
books the better they're going to do and he says this obsessed with this thought students plunge

1285
01:15:56.44 --> 01:16:03.72
deeper and even deeper their exertions but in and meshing them more until like myered

1286
01:16:03.72 --> 01:16:10.92
mastodons they perish in a morass of knowledge where they first browsed for sustenance

1287
01:16:12.04 --> 01:16:16.84
like I said Paddha good writer so you picture these big giant mastodons that you know

1288
01:16:16.84 --> 01:16:23.56
go fall into this murred this giant pit of knowledge it's just too much for them and they die

1289
01:16:23.56 --> 01:16:28.12
that's what happens this young leader just trying to read everything it's coming from a guy that

1290
01:16:28.12 --> 01:16:34.20
tells you to read everything and I say that I mean Paddha's telling you you need to read but what he

1291
01:16:34.20 --> 01:16:41.48
saying is like you can go so far to that you're you just end up well perish in a morass of knowledge

1292
01:16:41.48 --> 01:16:46.84
and he continues on when the prime spade of the unbiased investigator has removed the

1293
01:16:46.84 --> 01:16:52.68
muck of official reports and the mire of self-laterry biographies from the swamp of the world war

1294
01:16:53.32 --> 01:16:57.72
then the skeletons of many such military mammoths will be discovered

1295
01:16:59.72 --> 01:17:06.36
and what I love about this is as I as anyone knows from the books that we cover on this podcast

1296
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.44
I've said since they've day one oh why don't you cover this book about the great war this book

1297
01:17:12.44 --> 01:17:17.48
about World War II or this this that was written by this great historian I'm like oh no I like first

1298
01:17:17.48 --> 01:17:22.84
person accounts I actually like first person accounts as often as I came from like the front line soldiers

1299
01:17:22.84 --> 01:17:26.44
of course I like the general stew and the card kernels that's great but I like to hear what the

1300
01:17:26.44 --> 01:17:32.84
front line tap to say and that's that's part of what I like about his idea that just reading from this

1301
01:17:32.84 --> 01:17:38.76
from this high altitude doesn't necessarily give you the information you need he continues on

1302
01:17:38.76 --> 01:17:45.80
beyond questions no soldiers ever sought more diligently oh sorry he says amidst their mighty remains

1303
01:17:46.60 --> 01:17:53.56
will lurk the elusive secret of German failure he's talking about World War I beyond question no

1304
01:17:53.56 --> 01:18:00.84
soldiers ever sought more diligently for pre-war perfection they built and tested and adjusted their

1305
01:18:00.84 --> 01:18:07.40
mighty machine and became so engrossed in its visible perfection in the accuracy of its bearings

1306
01:18:07.40 --> 01:18:15.88
and the compression of its cylinders that they neglected the battery when the moment came their

1307
01:18:15.88 --> 01:18:25.24
masterpiece proved inefficient through lack of the divine afflits which is a divine inspiration

1308
01:18:25.24 --> 01:18:34.28
a divine thing and that is the soul of a leader so that the Germans were really rigid in the

1309
01:18:34.28 --> 01:18:38.92
way they prepared things and again this is his viewpoint but it's a pretty good viewpoint that

1310
01:18:38.92 --> 01:18:46.68
the Germans in World War I coming out of that prussian uh uh coming out of that that prussian

1311
01:18:46.68 --> 01:18:51.72
mentality like this is the way we're gonna do things but they forgot that you gotta have a soul

1312
01:18:53.08 --> 01:18:57.40
do you gotta have the soul of a leader and that's what happened to him they didn't that's what

1313
01:18:57.40 --> 01:19:02.12
he means the battery like where's that energy come from yeah guess what those soul of the leader

1314
01:19:02.12 --> 01:19:12.84
and he says this truly in war men are nothing a man is everything in acquiring a

1315
01:19:12.84 --> 01:19:21.40
tradition we must live on not in our studies so in order to require great knowledge you you have to

1316
01:19:22.20 --> 01:19:27.08
you have to live on the studies not in them we must guard against becoming so engrossed in

1317
01:19:27.08 --> 01:19:33.56
a specific nature of the roots on bark of the trees of knowledge as to miss the meaning and

1318
01:19:33.56 --> 01:19:39.80
grandeur of the forest that they compose that's a really complicated way of saying don't miss

1319
01:19:39.80 --> 01:19:48.04
the forest through the trees it fails the simplicity as has been pointed out the secret of victory

1320
01:19:48.04 --> 01:19:56.76
lies not holy in knowledge it lurks invisible in that vitalizing spark intangible yet as

1321
01:19:56.76 --> 01:20:05.08
evident as lightning the warrior soul that's where he's in the victory lies the warrior soul

1322
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.12
we shall now seek to evaluate and place in their just ratio the three essentials to victory

1323
01:20:14.12 --> 01:20:22.20
inspiration knowledge and force which he also calls mass we may therefore postulate that no

1324
01:20:22.20 --> 01:20:28.92
one element be its soul knowledge or mass is dominant that a combination of any two of these factors

1325
01:20:28.92 --> 01:20:34.92
gives a strong presumption of success over an adversary relying on one alone and that the three

1326
01:20:34.92 --> 01:20:38.60
combined are practically invincible against a combination of the other two so here's the important

1327
01:20:38.60 --> 01:20:44.68
things inspiration knowledge and and force or mass and he actually I'm not covered in now but he

1328
01:20:44.68 --> 01:20:48.20
gives some examples of where these things were important through history I'm not going to cover

1329
01:20:48.20 --> 01:20:58.28
them right now but these three things are what you need for victory he says man cannot live

1330
01:20:58.28 --> 01:21:07.08
by bread alone and that as a man thinketh so he is have been for generations drawn from countless

1331
01:21:07.08 --> 01:21:15.40
pulpits as the texts for proliques and unconvincing sermons until cognacy of the phrases has been

1332
01:21:15.40 --> 01:21:23.24
somewhat dulled yet they contain an infinity of truth and I think you say this a lot it means like

1333
01:21:23.24 --> 01:21:29.64
when you something that gets said all the time yeah there's a reason to cliche is a cliche right

1334
01:21:29.64 --> 01:21:35.000
there's a reason people say it yeah because there's some what is he called there's some infinity of

1335
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:41.08
truth in there right so that's what he's saying so these things man cannot live by bread alone

1336
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:49.96
and as a man thinketh so he is he those are cliches but there's truth in them war is conflict

1337
01:21:51.48 --> 01:21:57.40
fighting is an elemental exposition of the age old effort to survive it is the gold glitter of the

1338
01:21:57.40 --> 01:22:03.64
attackers eye not the point of the questing bayonet that breaks the line oh that's good

1339
01:22:04.44 --> 01:22:09.08
I'm going to read that one again it is the cold I said gold it is the cold

1340
01:22:09.08 --> 01:22:14.36
glitter of the attackers eye not the point of the questioning bayonet that breaks the line

1341
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:23.64
it is the fierce determination determination of the driver to close with the enemy not the

1342
01:22:23.64 --> 01:22:30.28
mechanical perfection of the tank that conquers the trench it is the cataclysmic

1343
01:22:30.28 --> 01:22:37.24
ecstasy of conflict in the flyer not the perfection of his machine gun which drops the enemy in

1344
01:22:37.24 --> 01:22:46.20
flaming ruin yet volumes are devoted to armaments and only pages to inspiration

1345
01:22:49.88 --> 01:22:59.32
so these actual man the human element is more important than the bayonet than the tank

1346
01:22:59.32 --> 01:23:04.28
and then the aircraft and then the machine gun and yet we talk about these are you know his books

1347
01:23:04.28 --> 01:23:10.84
written about these different weapons of war but not enough written about the soul of man

1348
01:23:11.64 --> 01:23:19.000
continuing on since by necessity limitations of map problems you go back to this this whole idea of

1349
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.88
figuring out things on a map and we're doing a terrain walk since by necessity limitations of

1350
01:23:23.88 --> 01:23:30.28
map problems inhibit the student from considering the effects of hunger emotion personality fatigue

1351
01:23:30.28 --> 01:23:37.56
leadership and many other imponderable yet vital factors he first neglects and then forgets them

1352
01:23:42.84 --> 01:23:48.76
crazy right you look at this map and you figure we're maneuvering your people and you think what you've

1353
01:23:48.76 --> 01:23:53.000
read about but you forget about the thing that I try to talk about all the time which is human nature

1354
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.44
which is understanding people understanding people understanding hunger emotion personality fatigue

1355
01:23:58.44 --> 01:24:04.76
leadership and always imponderable things those are what you need to be concerned about as a leader

1356
01:24:07.96 --> 01:24:13.32
going on obsessed with admiration for the intelligence which history is ascribed to leaders past

1357
01:24:14.44 --> 01:24:22.04
he forgets the inseparable connection between plans the flower of the intellect and execution

1358
01:24:22.04 --> 01:24:30.60
the fruit of the soul he's getting an A plus an in English class right now isn't it

1359
01:24:32.52 --> 01:24:38.76
the inseparable connection between plans which are the flower of the intellect and execution

1360
01:24:38.76 --> 01:24:46.36
the fruit of the soul you gotta have both you gotta have both yes you gotta have plans but then you

1361
01:24:46.36 --> 01:24:52.84
gotta be able to execute continuing on since the historian through lack of experience and

1362
01:24:52.84 --> 01:24:58.36
consequent appreciation of the inspirational qualities of generals fails to stress them he does

1363
01:24:58.36 --> 01:25:06.20
emphasize their mental gifts which since he shares he values this guy was smart like me

1364
01:25:07.32 --> 01:25:10.68
this guy was educated like me that's what made him so great just like me

1365
01:25:10.68 --> 01:25:16.84
yeah sometimes people say that even if they aren't necessarily that you know what like me and

1366
01:25:16.84 --> 01:25:21.16
you're alike in this way and then they'll say some cool quality that you have you know just sort of

1367
01:25:21.16 --> 01:25:26.44
implying yeah like that yeah I'm like that too and that's what this is right oh the historians

1368
01:25:26.44 --> 01:25:33.56
is oh this guy was very educated like I and like you said it doesn't always necessarily but he was

1369
01:25:33.56 --> 01:25:40.60
well written sure well and that's what they stress doesn't it doesn't stress the inspirational

1370
01:25:40.60 --> 01:25:45.24
qualities of the general doesn't stress that because he focuses on the fact that the guy was

1371
01:25:45.24 --> 01:25:53.48
educated or the guy went to Oxford or the guy went to whatever west point is that because it's

1372
01:25:53.48 --> 01:25:58.04
it's more concrete it's definitely more concrete but it's also it's a shared value it's like

1373
01:25:58.04 --> 01:26:03.16
what you just said you know this guy was smart like when somebody does something when

1374
01:26:03.16 --> 01:26:08.60
when another seal does something cool I'm like yeah we know he was in the day just like me dude

1375
01:26:10.92 --> 01:26:17.88
then it continues on hugging the notion of intelligence he pictures armies of incident ponds

1376
01:26:17.88 --> 01:26:23.80
moving with the precision of machines and the rapidity of light guided in their intricate and

1377
01:26:23.80 --> 01:26:31.48
resistless evolutions over the battlefield by the cold effolgence of his emotionless celebrations

1378
01:26:31.48 --> 01:26:37.56
as transmitted to them by wire and radio through the inspiring medium of coded messages

1379
01:26:40.68 --> 01:26:46.36
oh that's just a get some right that's what they picture though then you know this happens today

1380
01:26:46.36 --> 01:26:53.56
this happens today with um I just was just responding to someone on social media that was implying

1381
01:26:53.56 --> 01:27:01.16
this exact thing that oh well you know jockel you were only been in charge of elite teams of seals

1382
01:27:02.36 --> 01:27:07.08
and so guess what they are though those are incident ponds moving with the precision of

1383
01:27:07.08 --> 01:27:16.36
machines and the rapidity of light like no bro actually but that's what people think they're wrong

1384
01:27:16.36 --> 01:27:22.84
continuing doubtlessly he further assumes the same superhuman intelligence will translate

1385
01:27:22.84 --> 01:27:30.52
those somber sentences into words of fire which shall electrify his chest men into frenzyed heroes

1386
01:27:30.52 --> 01:27:38.92
who heedless of danger shall don'tlessly translate this stillborn infants of his brain into heroic deeds

1387
01:27:40.12 --> 01:27:44.84
so if you think you can just put out the word and now everyone's just gonna go

1388
01:27:44.84 --> 01:27:55.96
execute it with with undeniable tenacity and vigor you're wrong continuing on should critics have

1389
01:27:55.96 --> 01:28:04.36
assigned to all manner of things oh sorry should critics have assigned success to all manner of things

1390
01:28:04.36 --> 01:28:11.24
and hear some of the things that they assigned success to tactics shape of frontiers happily placed

1391
01:28:11.24 --> 01:28:18.92
rivers mountains or woods intellectual ability or to the use of artillery all in a measure true

1392
01:28:18.92 --> 01:28:24.28
but none vital so yeah you can be successful from all these different things and and the

1393
01:28:24.28 --> 01:28:28.36
uh... shrewd critics say oh you were successful because this or you were successful because of that

1394
01:28:28.36 --> 01:28:32.60
you were successful because of your tactics or your frontier or the river or the woods or whatever

1395
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:39.08
and it continues nor is it even the speed of the operations that the secret lays

1396
01:28:39.08 --> 01:28:46.60
but in the inspiring spirit with which they so inoculated their soldiers as to lift weary

1397
01:28:46.60 --> 01:28:54.76
foot-store men out of themselves and to make them march forgetful of agony that's the difference

1398
01:28:54.76 --> 01:28:56.04
according to pattern

1399
01:28:58.52 --> 01:29:05.56
in considering war we must avoid that adoration of the material as exemplified by scientists who

1400
01:29:05.56 --> 01:29:13.40
deny who deny the existence of ought they cannot cut or weigh so the scientists look at it

1401
01:29:13.40 --> 01:29:19.40
go well if you can't see it doesn't exist you can't weigh it it doesn't exist so therefore we're

1402
01:29:19.40 --> 01:29:27.64
not going to give any credit to these things that we can't exactly wrap our hand around the magic

1403
01:29:27.64 --> 01:29:40.12
spark as a mirror shows us not ourselves but our reflection so it is with the soul and with

1404
01:29:40.12 --> 01:29:48.28
leadership we know them but by acts they inspire or by the results they have achieved so you don't

1405
01:29:48.28 --> 01:29:53.64
see them you only know them by the acts that they make happen or things that are achieved through them

1406
01:29:53.64 --> 01:30:03.000
continue on like but gets like in the armies of the great we seek the reflection of themselves

1407
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.96
and we find self-confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self loyalty and courage so this is

1408
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:17.24
this is big right and this is this this and we'll get into it but here's what you find self-confidence

1409
01:30:17.24 --> 01:30:24.28
right boom this what you find self-confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self what is that right

1410
01:30:24.28 --> 01:30:30.60
abnegation of self is denial of the self this is like this is I'm not the most important thing

1411
01:30:32.84 --> 01:30:36.04
loyalty and courage resolution no matter how adamant

1412
01:30:36.04 --> 01:30:48.44
made it to knowledge no matter how infinite never be gap such a progeny so being firm in your

1413
01:30:48.44 --> 01:30:53.96
resolution and knowing a lot no matter how much of those two you have you never get as much as you get

1414
01:30:53.96 --> 01:31:00.68
with self confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self loyalty and courage such offspring only

1415
01:31:00.68 --> 01:31:07.88
arises from blood lines as elemental is themselves the leader must be in carnits of them now

1416
01:31:07.88 --> 01:31:15.48
this is what we're like that's a pretty bold statement right hey here I am a leader in the army

1417
01:31:15.48 --> 01:31:20.04
my name is general pat my name is well he's probably like a captain or maybe a major at this point

1418
01:31:20.04 --> 01:31:24.36
when he's writing this and he's saying that in order to be a really good leader he

1419
01:31:24.36 --> 01:31:31.64
have to be bloodline incarnate in Europe but then he says this which is awesome this is where I

1420
01:31:31.64 --> 01:31:36.20
get a little you know he started to move a little bit out of the box here then he comes right

1421
01:31:36.20 --> 01:31:40.36
back in the box and I had a paraphrase this one a little bit but nor is the suggestion

1422
01:31:41.32 --> 01:31:48.20
that birth is the only means of producing such a leader there are certainly born leaders

1423
01:31:48.20 --> 01:31:55.64
but the soldier may still overcome his natal defects by unremitting effort and practice

1424
01:31:57.24 --> 01:32:04.60
imagine that what's that the only traverses that's what it is that's what it is I've got a book

1425
01:32:04.60 --> 01:32:09.24
called Leadership Strategy in Tactics there's this there's a chapter in there called born or mate

1426
01:32:10.36 --> 01:32:16.52
and the answer is both and that's the same thing that general patency in here

1427
01:32:16.52 --> 01:32:23.16
you look you can be born a great leader but you can still overcome your natal defects

1428
01:32:24.20 --> 01:32:28.28
just by unremitting effort and practice that's how you can get good

1429
01:32:31.08 --> 01:32:34.28
self-confidence of the right so I think this is where he's going to start hammering through

1430
01:32:34.28 --> 01:32:38.04
yeah so he starts hammering through this list of things so the first one is self-confidence

1431
01:32:38.04 --> 01:32:44.60
self-confidence of the right sort as differentiated from bump-chewist presumption based in ignorance

1432
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:54.52
is the result of provenability the sense of conscious achievement it's existence presupposes enthusiasm

1433
01:32:54.52 --> 01:33:00.52
for without this quality no one would endure the trail veil of acquiring self-confidence

1434
01:33:00.52 --> 01:33:05.80
so self-confidence takes time in order to get self-confidence you have to be enthusiastic and you

1435
01:33:05.80 --> 01:33:10.36
have to be because you have to be successful things self-confidence you get just wake up and have it

1436
01:33:10.36 --> 01:33:15.96
you have you have it's it's conscious achievement it's provenability and the more you prove

1437
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:21.000
able the more confidence you're going to get which is interesting that in my new book I

1438
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.96
talk about how do you get someone to increase their confidence you're given tasks that they can

1439
01:33:23.96 --> 01:33:27.96
achieve that's exactly what he's saying over time that's how you build up self-confidence

1440
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:33.80
he continues on here the enthusiasm which permits the toil and promises the achievement is simply

1441
01:33:33.80 --> 01:33:40.12
an all absorbing preoccupation in the profession elected so when you're fired up for something

1442
01:33:40.12 --> 01:33:46.36
when you're enthusiastic that's what allows you to overcome the toil and the times that you drop

1443
01:33:46.36 --> 01:33:51.64
the balls that you're learning how to juggle you just keep picking them up and dirtiness

1444
01:33:51.64 --> 01:33:55.48
of the next one endurance to is linked with self-confidence mentally it is the ability to

1445
01:33:55.48 --> 01:34:03.56
subvert the means to an end to hit your wagon to a star and to attain it physically it presupposes

1446
01:34:03.56 --> 01:34:10.28
sufficient enthusiasm to force on nature no matter how reluctant the obligation of constant

1447
01:34:10.28 --> 01:34:19.40
bodily fitness through exercise hmm then he says the expanding waistline means the contracting

1448
01:34:19.40 --> 01:34:28.60
heart line both in length and vigor and then he says witness Napoleon at and after Jenna

1449
01:34:30.20 --> 01:34:34.76
the battle of Jenna which is where the questions figured out that they need to use maneuver

1450
01:34:34.76 --> 01:34:37.96
warfare and decentralized command but because that's because they got crushed by Napoleon

1451
01:34:40.60 --> 01:34:45.88
and I didn't I don't know apparently Napoleon at Jenna wasn't good shape and Napoleon after

1452
01:34:45.88 --> 01:34:58.92
Jenna maybe he let it go so constant bodily fitness through exercise mental ability to hit your wagon

1453
01:34:58.92 --> 01:35:07.80
to a star and attain it right that's endurance next up abnegation of self seems perhaps

1454
01:35:07.80 --> 01:35:15.72
incongruous when applied to such selfish persons as Frederick or Napoleon but this is not the case

1455
01:35:15.72 --> 01:35:20.28
so this is kind of funny too because right there be patting too it's patting too right

1456
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.40
I mean patting has at least a big Evan Ego as Napoleon or Frederick

1457
01:35:27.72 --> 01:35:32.28
but this is not the case he says self can be subordinated to self

1458
01:35:35.40 --> 01:35:41.32
the course of can leading his grenadiers at Lodi subordinated the life of bone apart to the glory

1459
01:35:41.32 --> 01:35:53.24
of Napoleon so once again even patting you know this is a form of humility right that's what it is

1460
01:35:53.24 --> 01:35:56.28
it's like everyone else is more important than me that's what it is

1461
01:35:59.08 --> 01:36:04.92
next one is loyalty loyalty is frequently only considered as faithfulness from the bottom up

1462
01:36:04.92 --> 01:36:12.68
it has another and equally important application that is from the top down one of the most frequently

1463
01:36:12.68 --> 01:36:20.44
noted characteristics of the great who remained great is the unforgittfulness and of loyalty to their

1464
01:36:20.44 --> 01:36:28.44
subordinates it is this characteristic which binds with hoops of iron their juniors to them

1465
01:36:28.44 --> 01:36:38.20
a man who is truly an unselfishly loyal to his superiors is of necessity so to his juniors and

1466
01:36:38.20 --> 01:36:45.72
they to him so this is great right loyalty up and down the chain of command you're just not

1467
01:36:45.72 --> 01:36:49.96
loyal to the people above you you're loyal to the people below you you take care of them

1468
01:36:51.80 --> 01:36:54.92
and if you take care of them they're going to take care of you once again it's in the book

1469
01:36:54.92 --> 01:37:09.48
leadership strategy and tactics next courage moral and physical is almost a synonym of all

1470
01:37:09.48 --> 01:37:15.000
forgoing traits it fosters the resolution to combat and cherishes the ability to assume

1471
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:22.20
responsibility the ability to assume responsibility be it for successes or failures

1472
01:37:22.20 --> 01:37:33.24
we call that extreme ownership he says but as with biblical candle these traits and now he's

1473
01:37:33.24 --> 01:37:38.84
that was the last trait now he's talking about all these traits these traits are of no military value

1474
01:37:38.84 --> 01:37:47.56
if concealed a man of definite manner will never inspire confidence a cold reserve cannot

1475
01:37:47.56 --> 01:37:55.64
be get enthusiasm and so with the others there must be an outward visible sign of the inward

1476
01:37:55.64 --> 01:38:03.80
and spiritual grace it then appears that the leader must be an actor and such is the fact

1477
01:38:05.72 --> 01:38:14.84
but with him as with his be wigged compare he is unconvincing unless he lives the part

1478
01:38:14.84 --> 01:38:19.80
so yes the leader has to be an actor but guess what if the leader doesn't actually believe what he's

1479
01:38:19.80 --> 01:38:26.28
doing it's bevons going to see through it just like an actor a be wigged actor be wigged that's like

1480
01:38:26.28 --> 01:38:33.32
a person wearing a wig okay so because I thought when you said an actor meaning someone who takes action

1481
01:38:33.32 --> 01:38:38.20
but he's not straight up straight up stage a person on the stage the person on the stage has to act

1482
01:38:39.40 --> 01:38:43.32
and he's unconvincing unless he lives the part and that's why a leader's got to be you got to live it

1483
01:38:43.32 --> 01:38:48.68
you got to think that you got to believe it stay character and if you don't believe it then

1484
01:38:49.80 --> 01:38:55.72
everyone's going to see through it yeah that's kind of truth everybody you know people like

1485
01:38:57.96 --> 01:39:02.12
are you we back in the day when I was a personal trainer and you get a personal trainer who's like

1486
01:39:02.12 --> 01:39:07.000
an out of shape you know okay but they you know according to them they know everything kind of

1487
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.96
thing is like brigh and kind of kind of I mean we can see it on you obviously but yeah if you feel that

1488
01:39:11.96 --> 01:39:20.36
you know so yeah you're not going to follow them clear your way more apt to follow you know some

1489
01:39:20.36 --> 01:39:27.24
if someone's a fitness instructor someone that's a good shape yes but more important for me

1490
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.88
is if you don't really believe in what you're saying as a leader everyone can see it and where

1491
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:43.08
this really comes into play then this is such a incredible thing and I've talked about it over

1492
01:39:43.08 --> 01:39:49.40
and over again and I put it there's a new addition of dichotomy leadership that I talk about this

1493
01:39:50.52 --> 01:39:54.20
I think it was the Barnes and Noble edition they put like a section in there that I had written this

1494
01:39:54.20 --> 01:40:00.12
article about and I talk about it in leadership strategy and tactics and that's this if

1495
01:40:00.12 --> 01:40:06.44
if your goal is to take care of yourself everyone can see it you're going to fail that's the

1496
01:40:06.44 --> 01:40:10.60
way it is like if your goal if you're if you're willing to step on people and cross them in order

1497
01:40:10.60 --> 01:40:14.12
to move up the chain of command everyone's going to see it and you're going to fail now look you

1498
01:40:14.12 --> 01:40:18.36
might get a couple wins here and there I get it but long term you're going to fail

1499
01:40:20.52 --> 01:40:25.96
if your goal is to take care of your team and accomplish the mission that's what your true goal is

1500
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:30.60
number one you're going to be successful in taking care of the team and successful in

1501
01:40:30.60 --> 01:40:35.64
accomplish the mission and then guess what a by-product is you will be successful as well

1502
01:40:36.36 --> 01:40:40.76
but the minute you say well wait a second maybe I'll just focus on myself for a second it's the wrong

1503
01:40:40.76 --> 01:40:45.16
move it's the wrong move what you want to do is say how can I best take care of my people that's

1504
01:40:45.16 --> 01:40:49.32
what you want to say that's what you want to believe that's what you want to do and if you do that

1505
01:40:49.32 --> 01:40:53.08
you take care of your people and you take care of your mission and that's where the way you're

1506
01:40:53.08 --> 01:41:01.24
operating everyone can see it up and down the chain of command by the way and eventually that will play

1507
01:41:01.24 --> 01:41:09.24
out correctly if you're looking to take care of you people will see that up and down the chain of

1508
01:41:09.24 --> 01:41:22.52
command and eventually that will play out incorrectly and then he says can a man acquire and demonstrate

1509
01:41:22.52 --> 01:41:28.92
these characteristics that's these characteristics self confidence endurance obligation of self

1510
01:41:28.92 --> 01:41:36.28
loyalty and courage can a man then acquire and demonstrate these characteristics the answer is

1511
01:41:37.24 --> 01:41:51.32
they have they can four as a man thinketh so is he so all these things if you think this way

1512
01:41:51.32 --> 01:42:01.64
you can become that way and he finishes this out by saying this the fixed determination to acquire

1513
01:42:01.64 --> 01:42:09.88
the warrior soul and have acquired it to either conquer or perish with honor

1514
01:42:09.88 --> 01:42:28.84
is the secret to victory George S. Paton Jr. major March 26th 1926 so

1515
01:42:31.72 --> 01:42:37.48
this guy's got a lot of a lot of things to talk about we might be rolling into a third session

1516
01:42:37.48 --> 01:42:51.000
next time delivering knowledge and I think it's just so important to think about these things especially

1517
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:56.04
a guy that's controversial like paton you know there's there's another quote about paton you know

1518
01:42:56.04 --> 01:43:03.72
because they called paton old blood guts and there's there's a quote about paton that someone

1519
01:43:03.72 --> 01:43:10.68
else said it was our blood his guts you know so there's some like that's a rough statement right

1520
01:43:10.68 --> 01:43:17.24
that's a rough statement so there's controversy you know around paton there's controversy about

1521
01:43:17.24 --> 01:43:23.64
some of the things that he did you know there's the whole episode of him slapping around

1522
01:43:23.64 --> 01:43:29.24
some of the guys that had left the front lines for various reasons that were not ham physically wounded

1523
01:43:29.24 --> 01:43:35.72
so some of the guys had some mental trauma you know whether they were shell shocked and what's

1524
01:43:35.72 --> 01:43:41.08
interesting about this is this is this is one of I'm sure we can get into but I'm reading another book

1525
01:43:41.08 --> 01:43:48.92
written by a by a leader in World War II and he's I was just reading this section where these

1526
01:43:48.92 --> 01:43:58.68
guys are coming to him crying we need you I can't take it anymore and one guy does it and he's like

1527
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:04.60
you know talk to him and you know says get back on the line the next guy comes and you know he's

1528
01:44:04.60 --> 01:44:09.72
crying he's distraught he's like I need to get off the line I can't take anymore and the guy says

1529
01:44:09.72 --> 01:44:14.36
you know Smith just came to me with these problems he did a much better job acting than you're doing

1530
01:44:16.36 --> 01:44:20.92
so my point and the guy eventually broke down and just said yeah but I mean I just it's really hard

1531
01:44:20.92 --> 01:44:25.48
and he says look I know it's hard everyone's having hard time you can do this my point is

1532
01:44:25.48 --> 01:44:30.60
when you had there was people that were shirking their duty there were people that were

1533
01:44:30.60 --> 01:44:34.28
look everyone was scared patented says it a thousand times everyone was scared

1534
01:44:35.32 --> 01:44:39.56
whether someone actually had you know shell shock who knows

1535
01:44:41.40 --> 01:44:46.12
certainly when you talk about caring about your people and you get somebody in a bad situation

1536
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:49.88
I mean Dick Winters talked about this when these guys were freaking out on the front lines how

1537
01:44:49.88 --> 01:44:54.92
he would handle it certainly wasn't by slapping around but that all is I'm saying it's that there's

1538
01:44:54.92 --> 01:45:03.16
controversy around pat and yet he's got great you take that controversy as part of what you can

1539
01:45:03.16 --> 01:45:13.64
learn at least I do and definitely a ton of perspective that he has so we'll we'll look at

1540
01:45:13.64 --> 01:45:19.24
people keep looking at patting I believe maybe not next episode but no no you never know what that

1541
01:45:19.24 --> 01:45:26.84
next episode's gonna bring I do know this I did some live gigs around America sure

1542
01:45:28.44 --> 01:45:33.32
they're they're over now when this podcast comes out the last two were Seattle and San Francisco

1543
01:45:33.32 --> 01:45:38.20
which both sold out which was awesome so to everyone that went to the jockel live shows around the

1544
01:45:38.20 --> 01:45:46.12
country thank you and for everyone that's asked for more looks like I'm gonna do some more so

1545
01:45:46.12 --> 01:45:54.12
jockel live we'll put that out soon on when these next ones will happen and the other thing is

1546
01:45:54.12 --> 01:46:00.04
the leadership strategy tactics and feel manual that I talked about today a couple times and just

1547
01:46:00.04 --> 01:46:07.000
just want to say thanks to everybody it's it's been crazy that the sales have been great and I know

1548
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.48
that's all because you all are out there getting after it's spread in the word made it number one

1549
01:46:11.48 --> 01:46:19.08
and a bunch of different a bunch of different outlets that actually measure this stuff so believe

1550
01:46:19.08 --> 01:46:25.32
me that every time I think about that I think about everyone that that listens to this podcast

1551
01:46:25.32 --> 01:46:33.16
and that spread the word and you know bought yourself a first of this and by the way there was

1552
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:39.40
some controversy someone sent a picture on social media and that cover was different and said you

1553
01:46:39.40 --> 01:46:44.68
know I waited as too long and I got the second edition I said no you're in Europe or you're in England

1554
01:46:44.68 --> 01:46:49.88
I think England New Zealand Europe and and basically outside America there's a different cover

1555
01:46:49.88 --> 01:46:55.08
it's still first edition as of right now cool why is there a different cover you know what

1556
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:05.96
I guess they have different styles or something that hey this is they they just said hey this is the

1557
01:47:05.96 --> 01:47:13.08
this is not the way books look over here and you know I just said I just said Roger that I'm not from

1558
01:47:13.72 --> 01:47:19.56
New Zealand I'm not from Australia I'm not from England I'm not from Germany I'm from America

1559
01:47:20.28 --> 01:47:26.60
and if you're telling me that this is like in the book it's not that much different but it's different

1560
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:33.80
but apparently that's normal you know and yeah make sense oh yeah I mean I don't you know I

1561
01:47:33.80 --> 01:47:40.84
try and keep my ego in check right I'm not George S. Pat and saying I'm right and history will prove it

1562
01:47:42.76 --> 01:47:46.36
I'm not thinking that and when somebody tells me something that's a professional and another arena

1563
01:47:46.36 --> 01:47:51.48
I go okay well maybe explain it to me you know and actually I did say that to them and they sent me a bunch

1564
01:47:51.48 --> 01:47:57.24
of other books it said hey here's like this is what books like look like over here your book will not look like a book even

1565
01:47:57.88 --> 01:48:02.04
yeah maybe I'm wrong you know I could have been wrong I could have said you know what let's hold the line and maybe

1566
01:48:02.04 --> 01:48:08.12
people would be looking at it going oh yeah this I'm getting this book I don't know yeah well it kind of

1567
01:48:08.12 --> 01:48:13.16
makes sense if you consider the concept right you know like you know some cars here like if they're

1568
01:48:13.16 --> 01:48:16.68
super exotic they'll have the steering wheel on the other side of the road or the other side of the

1569
01:48:16.68 --> 01:48:21.32
the car it'll be on the right side yeah you know I wouldn't call that super exotic that's just a car

1570
01:48:21.32 --> 01:48:27.96
that was built in the front country right but yeah okay period okay so let's say you're shopping for a car

1571
01:48:27.96 --> 01:48:32.60
and then you see like the steering wheel on the rear wheel it should have really made it would hey I'm not really

1572
01:48:32.60 --> 01:48:36.84
used to that you know and you could say ergonomically or whatever but you know if you

1573
01:48:37.40 --> 01:48:41.64
it's pretty quick to get it or for whatever mental reason doesn't even matter it's like the

1574
01:48:41.64 --> 01:48:47.64
chasm that needs to be crossed yeah we need to tighten that up a little bit yeah but if you go to Australia

1575
01:48:47.88 --> 01:48:52.52
right that's everybody same same so it's like boom we're used to that here where you see this here

1576
01:48:52.52 --> 01:48:56.28
on many different levels you know something's bigger than the other okay the car thing that's

1577
01:48:56.28 --> 01:49:02.28
probably in the side of the spectrum but the last book covers movie posters we used to

1578
01:49:02.28 --> 01:49:07.32
move poster if it doesn't look like a movie poster like how is that even gonna land as a movie

1579
01:49:07.32 --> 01:49:13.48
poster same same yeah so that's what we did so I guess the point is if you got the other cover

1580
01:49:13.48 --> 01:49:18.92
you're still good I'll still be I'll still still get you some knuckles on the first edition

1581
01:49:18.92 --> 01:49:23.88
when I opened up now I might open it up and it might say third a day that's different in which

1582
01:49:23.88 --> 01:49:31.32
case you know let me just look I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna embarrass you in front

1583
01:49:31.32 --> 01:49:37.80
everybody but I'm gonna look at you you're gonna know I'm gonna know that you didn't get the first

1584
01:49:37.80 --> 01:49:43.24
edition there's still first edition available right now but not much more they are running

1585
01:49:43.24 --> 01:49:53.32
around that second but so anyways I want to say thanks to everyone for all that super stoked and I

1586
01:49:53.32 --> 01:50:03.24
appreciate appreciate now speaking of acquiring a warrior soul which I know is a little bit of

1587
01:50:03.24 --> 01:50:12.52
a bold statement it is but we know from patent that we can move in the right direction as far as

1588
01:50:12.52 --> 01:50:20.28
improving our categories that we want improvement it can move us towards being a little bit

1589
01:50:20.28 --> 01:50:26.52
stronger a little bit better a little bit faster a little bit more of a warrior anything you can

1590
01:50:26.52 --> 01:50:32.36
recommend that could help us with that to be able to tactical advice for us maybe either conquer

1591
01:50:32.36 --> 01:50:39.64
or perish with honor yeah we can take jujitsu really that's really what it is what jujitsu is I mean

1592
01:50:39.64 --> 01:50:43.96
I don't want to say really that's what it is but we'll just say that's a part of it to conquer or

1593
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:51.24
perish with honor sure if mean you're about to roll and I we're gonna shake hands because it's a part

1594
01:50:51.24 --> 01:50:56.76
of the the deal it's not a rule but it's kind of it's not honorable thing respect what if instead of

1595
01:50:56.76 --> 01:51:01.56
shaking my hand I'm surprised you with like a guillotine or something like that I conquered but not

1596
01:51:01.56 --> 01:51:07.32
with honor well when I escape the guillotine sure okay all right then you are gonna pay right

1597
01:51:07.32 --> 01:51:12.12
then I'm the one who's gonna perish and by the way if you're well I know this is happening but

1598
01:51:12.12 --> 01:51:16.76
it happened to me like where somebody's all excited like all amped up and they think they're big

1599
01:51:16.76 --> 01:51:23.16
gate sure and so you go to shake their hand and like they either a don't and by the way we're

1600
01:51:23.16 --> 01:51:28.76
not talking like a formal hand shake as if we just signed a NATO peace treaty we know we're just

1601
01:51:28.76 --> 01:51:32.84
talking a little bump in roll right yeah it's a little little little little slap bump in roll

1602
01:51:32.84 --> 01:51:37.48
that's all we're talking about but occasionally especially especially this happens if you're going

1603
01:51:37.48 --> 01:51:43.88
with someone that like is really trying to kill you and then you submit them and then they're gonna

1604
01:51:43.88 --> 01:51:48.84
go again but they're so engrossed in like okay we're gonna make you get you this time they're like

1605
01:51:48.84 --> 01:51:55.96
forget they're like their minds insane yes yeah yeah that's uh that's good dubs or you can go

1606
01:51:55.96 --> 01:52:00.44
instead further I don't think I've ever done that by the way I don't think I've ever got so

1607
01:52:00.44 --> 01:52:07.88
amped up that I like just lost my mind I think you have I've done it jokingly you know I think you've

1608
01:52:07.88 --> 01:52:14.52
done it where you've gotten to the point where you're you want to go again so bad that you've that

1609
01:52:14.52 --> 01:52:19.56
like I'll put my hand up and you'll like get reminded of me like oh yeah we're actually like friends

1610
01:52:21.16 --> 01:52:26.84
I could be wrong I don't know and overall you're wrong but put it this way over all your

1611
01:52:26.84 --> 01:52:33.32
general way because yeah as frustrated as I've ever gotten with you which is like pretty frustrated

1612
01:52:33.32 --> 01:52:39.56
yeah like deep deep in golfing frustration there was always like a little governor on there where

1613
01:52:39.56 --> 01:52:45.88
it's like even like my expressions of frustration like there's always a hint of like joke in there

1614
01:52:45.88 --> 01:52:51.56
like to genuine I don't think I've ever that's not even how I get for it that's not how I look

1615
01:52:51.56 --> 01:52:58.28
when I get for really like frustrated like I'll get more quiet than anything but with you it's like

1616
01:52:58.28 --> 01:53:02.52
and we said talk about this before where you're so like you can take kind of anything you know like

1617
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:07.88
if I cheat with you like my straight up like you're rolling with any and I jump on your back and I

1618
01:53:07.88 --> 01:53:13.64
put a real choke in make you tap or whatever I feel like you can like take that you know like you

1619
01:53:13.64 --> 01:53:18.68
won't be all mad at me not externally anyway but you know I feel like you can just take

1620
01:53:18.68 --> 01:53:26.60
externally that would be retro music yes yeah but I'm just a favor but you see what I say won't

1621
01:53:26.60 --> 01:53:30.84
damage the relationship in any way you know like I feel like like you can kind of take these kinds of

1622
01:53:30.84 --> 01:53:41.24
things so it's almost like I'm in like a little free arena I believe me that's it's a good thing

1623
01:53:42.44 --> 01:53:47.40
I feel what I'm saying is I feel comfortable to just be like you know F u or whatever

1624
01:53:47.40 --> 01:53:53.80
I find sneak attacks on the GG2 map somewhat offensive yeah yeah so I'm what I'm telling you

1625
01:53:53.80 --> 01:53:59.72
to tell me that yep I've had a couple people do it over the years like you know like

1626
01:53:59.72 --> 01:54:06.20
tap someone out and like hey we were over by the wall and like kind of just turn my back to start

1627
01:54:06.20 --> 01:54:10.44
going back towards the center and have someone jump on my back and like put a choking yeah

1628
01:54:10.44 --> 01:54:15.24
that's that's cool but I'm first of all like I'm gonna get out and then I'm gonna you're gonna pay

1629
01:54:15.24 --> 01:54:21.56
because that's just you know that's you know what it is yeah and I think what offends me about it is

1630
01:54:21.56 --> 01:54:29.24
the like you can tell that their ego has flared up and they're trying to recover that or whatever

1631
01:54:29.88 --> 01:54:35.72
and so that maybe it is my ego that starts to flare up and I but I feel more like it's uh it's a

1632
01:54:35.72 --> 01:54:42.92
scenario where someone's outwine right underneath the there needs to be a lesson that gets taught

1633
01:54:42.92 --> 01:54:47.96
right at that point yeah I think you're right and I agree where and somebody actually also

1634
01:54:47.96 --> 01:54:53.96
asked me this on social media really recently which was like hey going with the guy he's grinding

1635
01:54:53.96 --> 01:54:59.24
his knuckles into my neck the whole time like into my face and he's like so I got on top and just

1636
01:54:59.24 --> 01:55:05.80
like mounted and like punished him with neon stomach or something like that is that is that bad

1637
01:55:05.80 --> 01:55:09.08
you know and there's a little bit of a question and I was like no it's proved like if someone

1638
01:55:09.08 --> 01:55:15.24
wants to get all freaking hostile and kind of I don't use the word dirty because it's not really dirty

1639
01:55:15.24 --> 01:55:20.28
but it's what would you call that what would you call that what they call it in Portuguese it's like

1640
01:55:20.28 --> 01:55:25.96
grosser right it's means like like kind of brutal yeah like if someone's getting crazy with me like that

1641
01:55:26.60 --> 01:55:35.80
then I'll probably put some kind of uh some kind of uh slightly increased measure back on them right

1642
01:55:35.80 --> 01:55:39.64
just slightly increased yeah not I'm not it's not like I'm gonna all know I'm gonna break

1643
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:45.56
someone's on the ground not at all but yeah if you want to you know grab hold of my whatever

1644
01:55:45.56 --> 01:55:50.76
and start squeezing it's like okay cool yeah you're gonna it's weird because the that one's

1645
01:55:50.76 --> 01:55:55.64
on emotional by the way so you're like okay cool yeah I see where you're at right

1646
01:55:55.64 --> 01:56:00.84
that's not not cool and here's how you can know yeah it can be tricky though because some

1647
01:56:00.84 --> 01:56:04.28
because there's different levels of that like some people literally don't know what they're doing

1648
01:56:04.28 --> 01:56:08.44
yeah and so much like the man just relax bro you know sometimes like hey I

1649
01:56:08.44 --> 01:56:13.32
probably should have said that to this guy too like just being like hey man if you get crazy with

1650
01:56:13.32 --> 01:56:17.24
people they might get crazy with you what you want to do is try and learn and try to have a good

1651
01:56:17.24 --> 01:56:21.32
time this isn't actual combat we're just having fun we're trying to learn so if you should

1652
01:56:21.32 --> 01:56:25.24
you should really go with that approach you know that's smart that's a smart yes because he

1653
01:56:25.24 --> 01:56:30.12
is a level don't know yeah they don't know and then then there's like this intermediary level where

1654
01:56:30.12 --> 01:56:35.40
they know but it's not aimed at you specifically it's aimed at sort of everyone you know you know

1655
01:56:35.40 --> 01:56:39.40
the kind you know the kind of they come maybe come from an environment where it's like that or

1656
01:56:39.40 --> 01:56:45.32
you know so it's like their whole attitude towards any competition is like crush you kill you

1657
01:56:45.32 --> 01:56:49.48
like you're my enemy kind of thing and they just have this kind of subconscious attitude about

1658
01:56:49.48 --> 01:56:54.60
here so that's how they roll and then then you get on the other side of spectrum which I think

1659
01:56:54.60 --> 01:57:02.12
is the ideal candidate for the repercussions is kind of where he's like mad at you maybe not even

1660
01:57:02.12 --> 01:57:06.60
necessarily because it's you but just he's having a bad day or he's just like frustrated because

1661
01:57:06.60 --> 01:57:11.40
he's not winning or whatever kind of thing and then he's kind of he's turning it up a notch like

1662
01:57:11.40 --> 01:57:16.52
and how you say he's stepping out of line and that's what it is it's like you're you're stepping

1663
01:57:16.52 --> 01:57:22.84
slightly outside of like the mutual like respectful agreement of this friendly like training

1664
01:57:22.84 --> 01:57:28.36
slash competition and the other thing is you gotta remember is like when I roll with Andy

1665
01:57:29.80 --> 01:57:35.32
like man we're smashing each other I mean it's full he's you know we're we'll do whatever like

1666
01:57:35.32 --> 01:57:41.40
it's full we might as well be competing for you know the world championships because if there's

1667
01:57:41.40 --> 01:57:47.08
a chance where he's trying to choke me and I've got my chin down he'll he'll choke my face no

1668
01:57:47.08 --> 01:57:51.48
no doubt about it I'll do the same thing like but if I was wrong with someone I didn't really

1669
01:57:51.48 --> 01:57:54.92
train with all the time and they bury their chin up again okay I'll go for an unlock or whatever you

1670
01:57:54.92 --> 01:57:59.40
know you're not just you're not just putting your forearm across there across there mandible

1671
01:57:59.40 --> 01:58:03.96
and cranking it as hard as you can to open up a neck exposure or just get him to tap from that right

1672
01:58:04.60 --> 01:58:09.88
you know so yeah and that's that's a subtle kind of dance he got as you too with like who you

1673
01:58:09.88 --> 01:58:14.04
roll with or whatever but I think generally speaking there's like an understanding where I think we all

1674
01:58:14.04 --> 01:58:19.32
sort of understand where yeah like that if you're real close with someone and you already know you

1675
01:58:19.32 --> 01:58:23.88
guys are used to that competition you can take it a little bit further yeah yeah for sure

1676
01:58:23.88 --> 01:58:28.60
and then even on top of that we're like and this I guess goes for people who you're at least

1677
01:58:28.60 --> 01:58:33.56
have a good rapport with whether it's with a man not where okay so there's you know Isaiah right

1678
01:58:33.56 --> 01:58:40.52
he's one of the MFA okay so we'll roll or whatever and sometimes it'll go into in this ongoing

1679
01:58:40.52 --> 01:58:45.40
scramble right so like one time he was like it was an ongoing scramble I don't know if he was on

1680
01:58:45.40 --> 01:58:51.96
purpose going outside of the mat like outside of the door he kind of did like to escape but he went

1681
01:58:51.96 --> 01:58:55.80
outside of the mat and I just chased him outside and jumped on his head I wear out in the

1682
01:58:55.80 --> 01:59:00.20
knot on the mat anymore over by the water fountain you know but I chased him not because no

1683
01:59:00.20 --> 01:59:04.76
know this it's still on it was like halfway joking you know get it like who we're still fighting

1684
01:59:04.76 --> 01:59:09.96
but it was like joking you know sometimes people do that like serious you know like you're hitting

1685
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:15.32
the mop in the corner and there's still a drain of go so so here's here's the important part of

1686
01:59:15.32 --> 01:59:27.32
this whole thing if the the reason that this is important is because if you and I are in a real fight

1687
01:59:28.92 --> 01:59:37.08
and you crank my face that doesn't mean anything I can I'm just gonna I'm like what am I going

1688
01:59:37.08 --> 01:59:43.32
to do I'm gonna try and bite you right there's with if you're cranking my face I'm not going to tap

1689
01:59:43.32 --> 01:59:52.36
to it you know so it is not a legit thing unless it opens up a choke right if you can make the

1690
01:59:52.36 --> 01:59:56.44
pain open up a choke with and that's fine I guess what I'm saying is there's things that you

1691
01:59:56.44 --> 02:00:00.76
could do to somebody like for here's another one breaking someone's finger right like I could grab

1692
02:00:00.76 --> 02:00:05.48
three or fingers if we were in a real fight grab two or fingers grab one of your fingers and just

1693
02:00:05.48 --> 02:00:12.52
break it does that end the fight no it doesn't end the fight and in fact it has a not a huge impact

1694
02:00:12.52 --> 02:00:20.20
on the fight immediately right you know like it's not gonna end the fight immediately so therefore

1695
02:00:20.92 --> 02:00:29.16
for me to grab at your fingers and try and break one of your fingers is not good training partner

1696
02:00:29.16 --> 02:00:35.80
because it doesn't really impact the the the fight look it has a small impact in the fight but

1697
02:00:37.88 --> 02:00:41.56
like I got you right and this is a good one because I've had people trying to

1698
02:00:41.56 --> 02:00:47.48
gouge out my eyes before it's it doesn't change the outcome of the fight at that moment look

1699
02:00:47.48 --> 02:00:51.08
if you get your finger and deep enough because I I have not done this but I've had friends

1700
02:00:51.08 --> 02:00:58.04
that have dug in for eyes and it can it's definitely it makes people react right but

1701
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:05.88
if someone's a trained fighter it's not this game changer it's not as a game changer as a

1702
02:01:05.88 --> 02:01:11.64
choke is yeah so therefore me going hey you can just attack my eyes and we're good

1703
02:01:12.20 --> 02:01:18.12
no because if you do that guess what I'm gonna have scratches on my eyes and yet it doesn't mean

1704
02:01:18.12 --> 02:01:22.68
that you could ever beat me it just means that I've scratched on my eyes doesn't change the outcome

1705
02:01:22.68 --> 02:01:26.84
so I guess there's the there's the strange part about this we're not the strange part that's

1706
02:01:26.84 --> 02:01:31.08
in some important because we do train hard we train hard for a reason yeah that's one of the

1707
02:01:31.08 --> 02:01:37.96
best things about you did so you can go 99% you can go 100% and hey if I get your normal

1708
02:01:37.96 --> 02:01:42.76
you tap if you give me an arm lock I tap cool then we go again if I gouge out your eye

1709
02:01:44.44 --> 02:01:50.92
it we can't go again and realistically it's hard to gouge out someone and I and it didn't

1710
02:01:50.92 --> 02:01:56.28
really change the outcome of fight because you'll still be fighting with one eye yeah so anyways at least

1711
02:01:56.28 --> 02:02:03.16
okay yeah and even if you're training for actually fighting or whatever like an outside of MMA I

1712
02:02:03.16 --> 02:02:11.48
guess but here's a good one biting off someone's ear right you know Igor yeah that's what made me think of

1713
02:02:11.48 --> 02:02:17.32
it so so Igor you know he got into a street fight and you know you you're all these people say

1714
02:02:17.32 --> 02:02:21.40
you know you rip off someone's ear they're gonna be done you know that's what somebody bit off

1715
02:02:21.40 --> 02:02:29.16
Igor's ear and he could he like I remember I was like bro and I said well what happened he

1716
02:02:29.16 --> 02:02:38.44
goes on like I got I got a side control and then you know mount and finish them you know with his ear

1717
02:02:38.44 --> 02:02:44.36
off big giant chunk of his ear golf yeah I mean visibly gone forever yeah you know Mike Tyson's

1718
02:02:44.36 --> 02:02:49.56
stuff yeah Mike Tiger bigger than Mike Tyson so this idea that all just bite this guy's here it's like

1719
02:02:49.56 --> 02:02:54.20
that's why if you and I were to go to train today and I'm like you know what just to make it

1720
02:02:54.20 --> 02:02:57.56
more realistic I'm gonna bite your ear off and then you're like bro what are you doing in your

1721
02:02:57.56 --> 02:03:04.44
stop does that mean I went no it means we lost in training yeah and I got a false sense of security

1722
02:03:04.44 --> 02:03:09.24
thinking that just biting off your ear would stop you when the reality is when it happened to Igor

1723
02:03:09.24 --> 02:03:16.12
he just was like oh cool now you're really tired so I know there's some guy that was on the

1724
02:03:16.12 --> 02:03:19.56
receiving end of that that's probably listening right now going on which I wouldn't have bitten that

1725
02:03:19.56 --> 02:03:27.40
guys ear because no man heavily paid the price and no one because this is the thing to bring us back

1726
02:03:27.40 --> 02:03:35.000
to jiu-jiu-jiu the the jiu-jiu that you train every single day is effective it's very effective

1727
02:03:36.04 --> 02:03:41.40
you don't need to bite you don't need to pull hair you don't need to galge eyes sure you can add

1728
02:03:41.40 --> 02:03:47.16
that stuff it's fine no real situation it's fine but the fundamentals that you know are infinitely

1729
02:03:47.16 --> 02:03:52.84
more powerful than these little additional things that you might think in your brain or a game

1730
02:03:52.84 --> 02:03:59.08
changer they're not yes thank you so jiu-jitsu so we want to train it let's go with that premise we

1731
02:03:59.08 --> 02:04:04.12
want to train jiu-jitsu do you have any recommendations on what we should utilize to train jiu-jitsu

1732
02:04:04.12 --> 02:04:13.96
yes discipline but a tire wise we're gonna go gui no gui boom so uniform for gui is a gui you

1733
02:04:13.96 --> 02:04:20.68

1753
02:06:30.04 --> 02:06:37.24
discipline go the pill and the can can is like the energy drink delivery system yeah we don't

1754
02:06:37.24 --> 02:06:44.44
like to say energy drink because energy drinks generally speaking are not healthy got the stigma

1755
02:06:44.44 --> 02:06:49.72
well not it's a it's an earned stigma they got a ton of sugar in them they got a bunch of nasty

1756
02:06:50.28 --> 02:06:56.20
chemicals yes but this one does not this does not but if you take away the nasty chemicals

1757
02:06:56.20 --> 02:07:04.44
of all the sugar and that's hard as if can caffeine excessive caffeine 300 400 milligrams of caffeine

1758
02:07:04.44 --> 02:07:10.92
you do not need that in one can yes so take away all those negative things you we have

1759
02:07:10.92 --> 02:07:17.40
everything else is is essentially energy drink material so it's I think it's just a stigma

1760
02:07:18.36 --> 02:07:24.36
okay it has a lightning bolt from the logo true it's in one of those little things yeah it is

1761
02:07:24.36 --> 02:07:28.52
a can oh yeah that's true that's not because it's an energy drink because it's traffic thunder

1762
02:07:28.52 --> 02:07:34.60
yeah and then it's in one of those little slim cans because lemon lime doesn't have a it has a

1763
02:07:34.60 --> 02:07:40.12
little little lemon lime on it on the citric citric citric citric citric citric

1764
02:07:40.12 --> 02:07:46.60
wedge and then the logo okay okay yeah yeah so yeah exception little twist there if you will

1765
02:07:46.60 --> 02:07:51.40
nonetheless if you like energy drinks but you're like hey I'm not down for all that that

1766
02:07:51.40 --> 02:07:59.32

so if your person that does something called jiu jitsu you probably want some of this and you know

1787
02:10:28.36 --> 02:10:35.88
it's really cool about it it's black the soap is black because it's got charcoal here good thing

1788
02:10:35.88 --> 02:10:43.08
yeah so so there you go get yourself some killer soap by a young kid he started a business no big deal

1789
02:10:43.64 --> 02:10:50.68
started it when he was like 11 started his own business got goats and decided what can I make with

1790
02:10:50.68 --> 02:10:56.36
goat milk oh I know what I can make soap killer soap which allows everyone in the world

1791
02:10:58.04 --> 02:11:06.68
just take lead oh my very nice also youtube we have a youtube channel official where echo

1792
02:11:06.68 --> 02:11:16.04
Charles is constantly trying his utmost to make a viral video he's got the ingredients he's got the

1793
02:11:16.04 --> 02:11:24.52
formula can he to can he pull it off I think my hypothesis that'll never be categorized beyond

1794
02:11:24.52 --> 02:11:31.64
hypothesis I think I don't think you can make a viral video like like that like you can't

1795
02:11:31.64 --> 02:11:35.000
know after you like okay I'm gonna formulate there is no formula for the

1796
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.56
I'm interesting to find out if anyone's ever said okay I'm gonna make a viral video and then it

1797
02:11:39.56 --> 02:11:47.16
worked I would think that there's some people like on youtube like youtube stars or whatever

1798
02:11:47.16 --> 02:11:54.28
that they can make consistent viral videos well that depends yeah yeah sir yes sir but yeah I

1799
02:11:54.28 --> 02:11:58.68
think it depends on what you mean my viral video because technically god what I understand my

1800
02:11:58.68 --> 02:12:05.000
video is like it just comes kind of from this real source and then it goes viral so so if the platform

1801
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.24
is already too big yeah I got 10 million subscribers and he gets 11 million views is that a viral video

1802
02:12:11.24 --> 02:12:17.16
okay point taken but the thing so the question is has a viral video ever been manufactured

1803
02:12:17.16 --> 02:12:23.80
proactively with intention yeah I sure somebody's muscle yeah I'm sure someone had a really good

1804
02:12:23.80 --> 02:12:28.28
idea and just came it hit him and they were like you know what and they just scored it was more

1805
02:12:28.28 --> 02:12:32.12
of a whole thing it wasn't a guaranteed thing but it was just like hey man this I don't see how

1806
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:36.12
this couldn't go viral kind of thing and they just happen to be right you know but I don't know

1807
02:12:36.12 --> 02:12:42.44
that there's a formula that someone can follow the rest in the event of us us making a viral video

1808
02:12:42.44 --> 02:12:48.92
this was gonna be me that would be you making viral videos no but you're the talent though so what

1809
02:12:48.92 --> 02:12:53.64
they call it officially you're the talent person in front of the can have been word rough shape bro

1810
02:12:53.64 --> 02:13:03.48
the lesson yes good editing yeah well I'm gonna do my best and subscribe to that channel

1811
02:13:03.48 --> 02:13:11.88
you can watch echo Charles and I talk about skinny knees or what have you I think that's the most

1812
02:13:13.88 --> 02:13:18.84
I think that's the best the funniest video might not be the best but it's it's it's it's

1813
02:13:18.84 --> 02:13:24.52
pretty funny I watch it once every two months and I still laugh every yeah there's some last to be

1814
02:13:24.52 --> 02:13:29.88
I won't agree with that psychological warfare if you need a little help getting over a moment of

1815
02:13:29.88 --> 02:13:37.72
weakness you're not alone you're not alone I will be there with you press play on your MP3

1826
02:14:53.64 --> 02:14:59.96

1848
02:17:21.96 --> 02:17:26.96
So we appreciate all you troopers out there, trooping.

1849
02:17:26.96 --> 02:17:32.48
And thanks to those of you that are out there in uniform,

1850
02:17:32.48 --> 02:17:35.40
the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, the coast,

1851
02:17:35.40 --> 02:17:38.88
guardmen who protect our way of life every day

1852
02:17:38.88 --> 02:17:41.12
and to our police and law enforcement,

1853
02:17:41.12 --> 02:17:44.000
to the firefighters, to the paramedics and EMTs,

1854
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.88
the dispatchers, the correctional officers,

1855
02:17:45.88 --> 02:17:47.68
the board of patrol, secret service,

1856
02:17:47.68 --> 02:17:50.32
and all the other first responders

1857
02:17:50.32 --> 02:17:52.56
that protect us here at home,

1858
02:17:52.56 --> 02:17:54.96
thank you for that.

1859
02:17:56.36 --> 02:17:57.52
And to everyone.

1860
02:18:00.76 --> 02:18:02.24
Remember what patent?

1861
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.80
Remember what patent taught us,

1862
02:18:05.80 --> 02:18:08.000
not only about war and leadership,

1863
02:18:09.08 --> 02:18:10.16
but about life.

1864
02:18:11.72 --> 02:18:13.72
And that is the fact that we all have weaknesses.

1865
02:18:13.72 --> 02:18:15.76
We all have shortfalls.

1866
02:18:15.76 --> 02:18:18.20
No one was born perfect,

1867
02:18:18.20 --> 02:18:20.40
but we can still overcome.

1868
02:18:22.24 --> 02:18:25.40
We can overcome our NATO defects

1869
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:28.44
through unremitting effort and practice.

1870
02:18:31.40 --> 02:18:34.52
And as he told his own son,

1871
02:18:34.52 --> 02:18:39.76
you can be born with a soul capable of correct military

1872
02:18:39.76 --> 02:18:43.64
reactions or the body capable of having big muscles,

1873
02:18:43.64 --> 02:18:46.88
but both qualities must be developed

1874
02:18:46.88 --> 02:18:48.68
by a hard work.

1875
02:18:51.84 --> 02:18:56.04
So don't sit back and accept the hand

1876
02:18:56.04 --> 02:18:59.20
that you've been dealt negative.

1877
02:19:01.44 --> 02:19:05.60
Instead, overcome your weaknesses,

1878
02:19:05.60 --> 02:19:09.44
capitalize on your strikes by getting out there

1879
02:19:11.12 --> 02:19:12.40
and getting after it.

1880
02:19:14.40 --> 02:19:16.000
And until next time,

1881
02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.68
this is echo and jockel out.
