00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.24
This is Jocko podcast number 350 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko willing. Good evening Echo. Good evening

2
00:00:09.88 --> 00:00:18.04
Sergeant Humphries squad secured a path and established a position from which they could overwatch second squad as they reentered friendly lines as

3
00:00:19.20 --> 00:00:24.68
Humphries Marines were breaking down their overwatch position to move back to fob incerman

4
00:00:24.68 --> 00:00:31.66
The rear element of the squad was pinned in a canal by heavy and accurate machine gun fire from Taliban

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hitted in a tree line. I

6
00:00:34.60 --> 00:00:37.96
Ran a sergeant Humphrey shouting. Let's go. We got to move on that gun

7
00:00:39.48 --> 00:00:48.08
Staff Sergeant Henley and I were converging on Sergeant Humphrey as we rushed to develop a plan to relieve the pressure on the pinned down

8
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:51.80
Fire team from the Taliban machine gun. I look back to see

9
00:00:51.80 --> 00:00:54.36
Zack was on my heels

10
00:00:55.16 --> 00:00:58.28
There would be no need for an interpreter where I was going

11
00:00:58.80 --> 00:01:02.30
He just saw me start running and he did the same

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Then Sergeant Humphrey stepped on a pressure plate IED

13
00:01:10.68 --> 00:01:15.84
The sound and force enveloped me in a sensation all went black I

14
00:01:15.84 --> 00:01:21.40
Have no idea how long I was out, but when I came to the first person I saw

15
00:01:22.60 --> 00:01:24.60
was Zack

16
00:01:24.92 --> 00:01:31.80
He knelt beside me over me my rifle in his hand protecting and supporting me as I fought to my feet. I

17
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.28
Imagine we looked like a filthy Madonna and child in the moment as

18
00:01:38.40 --> 00:01:42.56
Zack helped me rise. I looked to my left and saw Staff Sergeant Henley

19
00:01:42.56 --> 00:01:48.36
He lay in a heap a tangle of his own limbs himself struggling to rise

20
00:01:49.24 --> 00:01:56.20
He had also been knocked out and was shouting at me unaware that blood poured from his own blown out eardrums. I

21
00:01:57.60 --> 00:02:02.12
Could make no sense of what he was saying then I saw Humphrey and stopped trying to

22
00:02:03.68 --> 00:02:08.000
When I got to him Sergeant Humphrey's right foot was completely blown off

23
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.44
All the muscle and tissue on his left calf was gone his left thigh lay open from a piece of shrapnel

24
00:02:16.84 --> 00:02:22.12
Later I would learn his jaw was broken, but for now he lay at my feet screaming

25
00:02:23.84 --> 00:02:29.32
Doc Collins and Corporal Matt Bland rushed to Sergeant Humphrey and began treating his grievous wounds

26
00:02:29.32 --> 00:02:33.24
I called in a medevac as I held the meat of his calf to the bone as

27
00:02:34.16 --> 00:02:36.16
Niercrick wrapped it

28
00:02:36.16 --> 00:02:39.12
With Corporal Sean we he

29
00:02:39.92 --> 00:02:41.92
Directing the squads fire upon the enemy

30
00:02:42.44 --> 00:02:50.52
Corporal Spivey swept the kill zone for more IEDs and then swept a clear path to the point at which the medevac aircraft would pick up Humphrey

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.12
Through it all Sergeant Humphrey remained poised directing his own treatment and movement

32
00:02:57.64 --> 00:03:02.68
As we carried Humphrey to the medevac helicopter all I could think was what a bad day

33
00:03:02.68 --> 00:03:07.56
It was in for insufficient for the moment, but it was all I could think to say

34
00:03:08.32 --> 00:03:13.88
They tried to put me on the helicopter, but with Staff Sergeant Henley and Sergeant Humphrey both wounded and gone

35
00:03:13.88 --> 00:03:15.88
There was no way I was leaving

36
00:03:16.80 --> 00:03:24.60
When we returned to Fobb, Inc. The CO handed me a towel to wipe the blood off my hands and gear and said Sergeant Humphrey is gonna lose a leg

37
00:03:24.60 --> 00:03:26.60
But the surgeon says he will live

38
00:03:27.40 --> 00:03:29.40
But what happened out there?

39
00:03:29.40 --> 00:03:34.48
I looked at him and exhaled I don't know sir that file is deleted

40
00:03:36.72 --> 00:03:41.52
There was little else to say so I turned away and went back to debrief of my platoon

41
00:03:42.48 --> 00:03:46.60
I was tired and sad and likely can suck concussed, but I had a job to do

42
00:03:48.76 --> 00:03:56.32
Zach always did his and more I could do the same bringing out the collective narrative in the debrief began to bring back the details for me

43
00:03:56.32 --> 00:04:01.88
But Zach standing over me ready to kill to protect me stood out in stark relief from the start

44
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:04.88
That vision

45
00:04:04.88 --> 00:04:12.68
Zach silhouetted against the dust still swirling from the explosion that flattened me color and detail becoming clear as my consciousness

46
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:17.08
Returned is what is one I still see sometimes as I wake

47
00:04:19.04 --> 00:04:23.52
It says something about Zach as a man as a battlefield interpreter and

48
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:29.52
as my friend it was a common it was common to hear Americans say of the Afghans

49
00:04:30.40 --> 00:04:32.40
We can't want it more than they do

50
00:04:33.88 --> 00:04:35.88
But it often seemed we did

51
00:04:36.56 --> 00:04:38.56
Zach was a huge exception

52
00:04:39.40 --> 00:04:41.52
He was not a soldier, but he was there to fight

53
00:04:42.76 --> 00:04:45.92
He understood our missions in a way that other interpreters did not

54
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:50.52
Most interpreters were like specially items in our packs

55
00:04:50.52 --> 00:04:54.56
Inert and just riding along until it was time to employ them for their purpose

56
00:04:55.56 --> 00:05:02.68
But Marines are utility players capable of addressing a wide array of circumstances and expected to prevail in each

57
00:05:04.36 --> 00:05:07.52
Like a Marine Zach was an active member of 1st platoon

58
00:05:09.20 --> 00:05:12.52
He did not shy away from any danger. He did not question

59
00:05:13.12 --> 00:05:17.60
Doing whatever the mission demanded because he was committed to it for Afghans

60
00:05:17.60 --> 00:05:26.24
Zanoula Zaki ran to the sound of the guns in a way that would have made a Marine infantry instructor smile

61
00:05:28.28 --> 00:05:34.48
Standing at the debrief talking through what happened as is expected after every operation

62
00:05:34.48 --> 00:05:39.52
I told the platoon that all of us were going out the next day for Humphrey's revenge

63
00:05:41.12 --> 00:05:44.56
I thanked Zach for his willingness to offer him a mission

64
00:05:44.56 --> 00:05:52.32
I thanked Zach for his willingness to always be where he might be needed particularly when it was protecting my life

65
00:05:53.96 --> 00:05:58.36
I'd already come to see Zach as more than an interpreter, but now

66
00:05:59.04 --> 00:06:01.04
There was no way to call him anything

67
00:06:01.72 --> 00:06:03.72
but a brother

68
00:06:06.80 --> 00:06:08.80
And that right there is

69
00:06:08.80 --> 00:06:22.76
An excerpt from a book which is called Always Faithful a story of the war in Afghanistan the fall of Kabul and the unshakable bond between a Marine and an interpreter

70
00:06:23.68 --> 00:06:25.68
And this is a book

71
00:06:25.84 --> 00:06:29.64
That was written by that Marine and that interpreter

72
00:06:30.32 --> 00:06:36.44
The Marines name is Major Tom Schumann and the interpreter an Afghan national

73
00:06:36.44 --> 00:06:40.000
His name is Zanoula Zaki

74
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:48.28
And they serve together in Helmand Province with three five Marines during an extremely violent deployment

75
00:06:48.80 --> 00:06:55.72
And they had each other's back on the ground there and they continued to support each other even as

76
00:06:56.28 --> 00:07:00.000
Afghanistan fell apart and it's an incredible story of

77
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.72
How all that went down and it's an honor to have the Marine

78
00:07:06.44 --> 00:07:11.12
From this story Tom Schumann here with us tonight to share his experiences

79
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:13.96
and his lessons learned

80
00:07:13.96 --> 00:07:16.64
from the battlefield and from life

81
00:07:18.04 --> 00:07:20.04
Tom thanks for coming down man

82
00:07:20.16 --> 00:07:22.16
Sir, thanks for having me Echo. Thanks

83
00:07:23.04 --> 00:07:29.28
And you're just right up the street. I can't penalty that's a firm up in San Mateo on the north side of base active duty

84
00:07:29.28 --> 00:07:36.92
Marine currently serving and you're the what XO operations officer. Oh, oh so not quite XO

85
00:07:38.56 --> 00:07:40.56
Still on the trenches hooking and jabbing

86
00:07:41.48 --> 00:07:46.32
Awesome, man. Well, thanks for coming down and thanks to your chain of command for allowing you to come down here for the day

87
00:07:46.32 --> 00:07:51.000
I know that's not always an easy thing to pull off but appreciate it and I always well

88
00:07:51.40 --> 00:07:57.32
Everybody knows I love the Marine Corps. So I I appreciate that we're getting a little love from the Marine Corps today. It's outstanding

89
00:07:57.32 --> 00:08:01.12
Let's just get into this. This is a this is a great story. Well,

90
00:08:01.64 --> 00:08:04.44
Well parts of it are a great story parts of it are rough

91
00:08:06.20 --> 00:08:10.000
I like to start at the beginning kind of figure out where you came from and

92
00:08:10.88 --> 00:08:15.20
How you got to this point in your life today? So I'm gonna go to the book

93
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:22.16
It says I grew up steeped in chaos surrounded by weak men who wouldn't control their temper

94
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:29.72
Didn't consider consequences and bullied women through their body language or by getting even louder than loud women

95
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:32.72
My mom did what she could to provide stability

96
00:08:32.72 --> 00:08:38.20
But my childhood memories, but in my childhood memories, there is a through line of angry screaming

97
00:08:38.64 --> 00:08:40.64
Holes punched in walls

98
00:08:40.88 --> 00:08:43.08
Throne glasses shattered

99
00:08:43.64 --> 00:08:47.60
The effect of that has been for me to seek the opposite in all things

100
00:08:47.60 --> 00:08:51.60
It's almost incalculable to me that someone does not consider

101
00:08:51.80 --> 00:08:54.84
Consequences I am very comfortable in chaotic situations

102
00:08:54.84 --> 00:09:02.04
But control over myself and my surroundings is second only to my faith in Christ in defining the essence of who I am

103
00:09:02.84 --> 00:09:06.32
My mom was a good kid left to fend for herself

104
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.36
The Southside offers a million ways to get off track and by 13

105
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:16.40
She was feral drinking and drugging for the remainder of her teenage years

106
00:09:16.40 --> 00:09:20.32
At 17 she was waiting tables in Chicago to pay for partying

107
00:09:20.84 --> 00:09:25.24
When my father showed up on a motorcycle with a guitar and long blonde hair

108
00:09:25.48 --> 00:09:27.48
He chatted her up and played her a song

109
00:09:28.36 --> 00:09:32.76
She put down her order pad, hopped on the back of the bike and rode off with him

110
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Then he decided they needed to move to Georgia

111
00:09:36.28 --> 00:09:43.56
By 18 my mom was a pregnant high school dropout who quit using out of duty to me her unborn child

112
00:09:43.56 --> 00:09:48.56
Three years later she was married with two kids living 800 miles away from her family

113
00:09:49.56 --> 00:09:53.56
Things got bad fast. My earliest memories are of them fighting

114
00:09:53.56 --> 00:09:59.56
When my mom confided in my father's sister, I have to get out of here. I can't raise these kids in all this

115
00:09:59.56 --> 00:10:01.56
She agreed to take the three of us to Chicago

116
00:10:02.56 --> 00:10:09.56
My mom packed three-year-old me and my three month old sister Jesse into my aunt's yellow dots and hatchback

117
00:10:09.56 --> 00:10:14.56
And ran back to the south side when we got there we landed in my great aunt's house

118
00:10:15.56 --> 00:10:19.56
Mom called my father in Georgia and told him we wouldn't be back

119
00:10:23.56 --> 00:10:28.56
Well, it's a wild way to get it all, okay to get started

120
00:10:29.56 --> 00:10:36.56
Yeah it was a wild time there to start off and I think it really was a wild time

121
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:42.56
And to some degree it probably helped me professionally

122
00:10:43.56 --> 00:10:49.56
This idea of equanimity that calm in the storm and when there's constantly chaos and emotion all around you

123
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:56.56
I found that I would go inside get everything inside of me ordered and restored

124
00:10:57.56 --> 00:11:03.56
And to be honest I think I was a little bit more of a person

125
00:11:03.56 --> 00:11:10.56
I was a person who had been restored and to be able to you know there's a great line in Gates of Fire

126
00:11:11.56 --> 00:11:19.56
By Stephen Pressfield where the platoon commander Diane Ikees he talks about the role of the officer is self-composure

127
00:11:20.56 --> 00:11:26.56
And it's the fire your troops when they won't go forward and it's the rain them in when they've gone blind to rage

128
00:11:26.56 --> 00:11:34.56
This idea of self-composure was really a survival mechanism for me early

129
00:11:35.56 --> 00:11:39.56
But it translated later on into I think being helpful professionally

130
00:11:40.56 --> 00:11:44.56
And just to me men who cannot

131
00:11:44.56 --> 00:11:55.56
Men who resort to physical intimidation or to raising their voice is its weakness

132
00:11:56.56 --> 00:12:02.56
It's cowardice and if you can't logically compel someone with

133
00:12:03.56 --> 00:12:07.56
At a conversational tone of your point then you probably don't have a very good argument

134
00:12:07.56 --> 00:12:13.56
Or maybe you're just talking to the wrong person you know and so yeah it definitely shaped me

135
00:12:14.56 --> 00:12:21.56
But I think when we're talking about cowardice I think we can juxtapose that with courage and that's my mom's courage

136
00:12:22.56 --> 00:12:25.56
One to have me when she was 19

137
00:12:26.56 --> 00:12:31.56
I mean I look back and I reflect on that decision often

138
00:12:31.56 --> 00:12:41.56
That how scared she must have been the uncertainty and for her to go through with it and to bring me into this world at 19

139
00:12:42.56 --> 00:12:48.56
I will always just be so grateful for her courage there and

140
00:12:49.56 --> 00:12:56.56
And then the same thing just to what every parent wants for their child is an opportunity

141
00:12:56.56 --> 00:13:01.56
And you're going to see that you know when we start to talk about Zach and what he did towards the end of this book

142
00:13:02.56 --> 00:13:09.56
And she understood that the best way for us to have an opportunity was again required courage

143
00:13:10.56 --> 00:13:17.56
She's 22 years old with two little kids and drives 800 miles back to Chicago with nothing

144
00:13:17.56 --> 00:13:26.56
Nothing and but that's a conviction and so yeah really that was my first example of courage is my mom

145
00:13:27.56 --> 00:13:33.56
Yeah the um as far as one thing I talk a lot about with leaders is

146
00:13:34.56 --> 00:13:40.56
You're basically there's a mob right your team is a mob whether it's a platoon whether it's a troop whether it's a sales team

147
00:13:40.56 --> 00:13:47.56
It's a mob and just like any other mob like they can get going in a certain direction

148
00:13:48.56 --> 00:13:54.56
And your job as a leader is to make sure that the direction that the mob is going is correct

149
00:13:55.56 --> 00:14:03.56
And the two classic examples kind of ones you mentioned a little bit but my team does great right we go out and do a great mission and everything goes smooth

150
00:14:03.56 --> 00:14:10.56
That mob mentality can be hey look we're unstoppable we don't need to we don't need to rehearse very much we don't need to worry about planning because we're so good

151
00:14:11.56 --> 00:14:16.56
You as a leader need to go actually hey we did good but here's some things we can improve here's what we got to watch out for

152
00:14:17.56 --> 00:14:23.56
So you got to pull the opposite direction of the mob the other time is like oh you go out the mission goes sideways goes bad

153
00:14:24.56 --> 00:14:31.56
And you can feel the mob start to get dragged down and then it's your job to as leaders say hey yep we made some mistakes we paid for it but here's what we're going to do to fix it next time

154
00:14:31.56 --> 00:14:38.56
So that idea of and look there's sometimes where the mob is going in the right direction you can just yeah that's the easy that's the fun part of being a leader

155
00:14:39.56 --> 00:14:43.56
The mob is going in the right direction you get to just cheer them on and say hell yeah

156
00:14:44.56 --> 00:14:51.56
So that's a very important thing to pay attention to you can't do that if you're getting emotional you just can't you'll be in the mob

157
00:14:52.56 --> 00:14:59.56
And in the mob is not the place for you to be in a leadership situation yeah the yelling thing I think it's one of the one of the interesting stereotypes that

158
00:14:59.56 --> 00:15:08.56
The military has the stereotype that you yell and scream to get things done part of it's because of boot camp movies right

159
00:15:09.56 --> 00:15:19.56
How many times have you watched the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Dracket right I mean it's just that's the oh that must be the way leadership is and it's and as you and I both know

160
00:15:19.56 --> 00:15:29.56
There's plenty of leaders inside the military that that that do yell and they do scream and that goes back to the book the psychology of military incompetence

161
00:15:30.56 --> 00:15:40.56
What attracts the military to people like that and attracts people like that to the military but you know I just have an interesting you know with a guy that worked for me and wrote these books with me

162
00:15:40.56 --> 00:15:49.56
Leif Babin you know he's he's worked for me you know for 18 months workup deployment and then we've been working together for another 15 years or something like that

163
00:15:50.56 --> 00:15:57.56
And he'll always ask a crowd of people you know how often you think Jocko yells at me and you know you know depending on how much the people know about me

164
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:07.56
You know oh he must yell at you all the time and he's like he's actually never yell I've never yelled at him one time and Leif usually gives the caveat that he gave me plenty of times where I probably wanted to yell at him

165
00:16:07.56 --> 00:16:18.56
But it's just bad leadership and again the same thing you just said if I can't convince you of my idea my idea is probably not that great

166
00:16:19.56 --> 00:16:28.56
And your ideas either that or my ideas not that much greater than yours so my default is once you go with yours that's easier it's going to it's going to make everything more efficient effective

167
00:16:28.56 --> 00:16:40.56
So going back to the story here so you're this chapter as soon as I got this chapter the chapter is called a hippie cops son

168
00:16:41.56 --> 00:16:55.56
So you being the son your mom being the hippie cop talk to us through the transition of your mom going from being a hippie that's that's jumping on the back of a chopper with a random dude with long hair and going to Georgia

169
00:16:55.56 --> 00:17:06.56
And having kids to coming back here and you know and plus you mentioned you know she was drinking at a young age doing drugs and all of a sudden she does like a 180 and she becomes a cop what was that all about

170
00:17:07.56 --> 00:17:14.56
Yeah I don't think the hippie part ever fully transitioned I think it was she was duty bound and she

171
00:17:15.56 --> 00:17:17.56
And the duty was you and your sister

172
00:17:17.56 --> 00:17:28.56
Yes and so she didn't grow up with her dream job being a Chicago cop it was there was health insurance and she had two hungry babies and and that was who was hiring

173
00:17:29.56 --> 00:17:42.56
And so I think yeah the if if you talk to my mom today that that hippie part of her is still alive and well and was never quite subordinated by the her time as a cop

174
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:47.56
The hippie comes out quite a bit as you're going in the Marine Corps you're going in the infantry

175
00:17:48.56 --> 00:17:49.56
It comes out sorry mom

176
00:17:50.56 --> 00:18:01.56
For sure and so yeah my mom had two rules you know don't don't join the military and don't get more cycle did both and then a crash more cycle and I've had quite a interesting Marine Corps career

177
00:18:01.56 --> 00:18:17.56
But yeah it was it was simply a matter of necessity and duty for her children so that's why she became a cop not not because she'd you know was watching bad boys bad boys or whatever you know the 90s that was not a it was it was yeah

178
00:18:18.56 --> 00:18:26.56
And I imagine single mom being a cop that's I mean how the hell does that even work yeah she's what kind of hours she working

179
00:18:26.56 --> 00:18:41.56
She's small 82 you know she's tiny and she's cop in Chicago in the 90s it was tough tough gig but at the end of the day she she had something that she was serving that was bigger than herself

180
00:18:41.56 --> 00:19:04.56
And and and service always comes at a cost or it's not service you know and service always hurts and if it doesn't hurt to some extent you know then again I would argue maybe it's not service and so I think she's working nights on the south side of Chicago in the 90s

181
00:19:04.56 --> 00:19:22.56
And kind of raised by a village there as a kid getting passed off to my aunt my grandma you know and but a little collective effort there but yeah it was it was you know all my mom my sister and I all slept in the same bed for like the first five six years when we got back in a room in my

182
00:19:22.56 --> 00:19:47.56
Aunt's house I mean it was it was tough meanwhile as that's going on your dad ends up going to jail when you're eight years old how's that go down yeah I was still visiting him during the summers for a couple years after we went back to Chicago I'd still go down there for the summer and then just one summer

183
00:19:47.56 --> 00:20:11.56
I wasn't going and and yeah I think he was something with drug drug related and I what's tough for me about that when I think about my dad I look at pictures of me when I'm a kid and I and I'm the age four or five you know six years old

184
00:20:11.56 --> 00:20:38.56
And I think you know you've got a choice and you got this little kid this little boy and how could you not choose him and that's like what will sometimes to this day when I when I just come across and this and now I've got my daughter just turned four you know and I and I just think I will always choose you and

185
00:20:38.56 --> 00:21:07.56
There's that a boy needs a dad period and and my mom was super mom and she did she taught me how to throw football and she played catch with me she was not my dad and and that that was something that you know go you don't want to go to the father son banquet with your friends dad

186
00:21:08.56 --> 00:21:34.56
And fortunately I had you know some some guys who some of my friends that's who looked after me but that that took a long time to the still I'm still kind of probably working through some of that but he got out of jail when I was about to graduate junior high and I went back for the first time to see him but yeah that that absence was painful and yeah

187
00:21:34.56 --> 00:21:51.56
Yeah you you describe it in here going back to the book here you say I followed my mom into a room after dinner and sat there while she tried to decompress from her day she was folding clothes and she tried to talk to me I was non responsive she looked me straight in the eye

188
00:21:51.56 --> 00:22:09.56
Thomas tell me what's wrong I was suddenly crying so hard I couldn't stand I lay on the floor I just want a dad I said over and over through the gasps and sobs eventually my best friends dad started taking me to the father son events he wasn't my father but at least I was with a man who cared about me

189
00:22:09.56 --> 00:22:26.56
I want an autographed picture of Chicago Bears wide receiver Tom Waddle at one father and son banquet winning that 8 by 10 black and white headshot capped off the best night of my life then my best friends dad hung himself in his garage

190
00:22:26.56 --> 00:22:45.56
My father was in prison three states away my supplemental father figure killed himself and most of the men in my life were unaccountable and made me mistrustful of men and it also left me such that now when I perceive a void or a gap I feel a compulsion to fill it to make it better

191
00:22:45.56 --> 00:22:59.56
put less positively I'm unable to resist trying to bend a situation to my will I've never been the smartest or most talented guy in any room I've been in but I am relentless for better or for worse

192
00:22:59.56 --> 00:23:20.56
yeah as I was reading this they will get to some of these parts where you are determined a little too determined with the kind of determination that'll get you in trouble it's a kind of thing when you have kids and you're like oh my this kids pissing me off and you realize oh that's because it's a strong willed kid and you actually want those things

193
00:23:20.56 --> 00:23:45.56
you mentioned your dad got out of jail when you're 13 years old and this sounds and when you talk about in the book this is sort of like kind of a little bit of like sounds like you're living the dream a little bit you're down there in Georgia for the summers you got horses you got four wheelers you got jet skis and you're working hard so that was like a good experience you're learning a lot

194
00:23:45.56 --> 00:24:01.56
definitely a little best of both worlds going to grow up run wild in the alleys of Chicago that's kind of where we hung out in the alleys playing basketball playing whatever getting in trouble and then yeah the summers I get to be a little pretend cowboy and ride a horse almost fall off it you know crash a four wheeler and go out on the lake

195
00:24:01.56 --> 00:24:23.56
so yeah it was a it was a nice little blend it to kind of get to experience both things and and I did learn some things about hard work working for my dad I worked for him for four years until I was 16 like all summer and on my 16th birthday said you know you've

196
00:24:23.56 --> 00:24:48.56
throughout the these last four years you've saved up enough to get a car you got a 1985 Nissan Maxima wagon with 250,000 miles on it. Hell yeah. So like definitely appreciate learned learned appreciate hard work and so that there was some there was some good lessons learned and you did you went to an evangelical Christian camp down there yeah and you know

197
00:24:48.56 --> 00:25:00.56
you know South Side Chicago is all Italian and Irish and very Catholic and so I was kind of raised in and around the Catholic Church my dad was Southern Baptist I went to the Southern Baptist camp and

198
00:25:01.56 --> 00:25:15.56
very different. I was going to say that's very different. Definitely definitely different but you know I the most important day of my life happened during that camp and that's when I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and

199
00:25:15.56 --> 00:25:44.56
undoubtedly that camp in that moment I'm only here today because of that encounter and and and to be I've always had a father you know and so I've always I've men in the church you know may abandon you I've always had a father and and that father has you know when we talk about the title always

200
00:25:45.56 --> 00:26:02.56
faithful that that's always faithful and so in my darkest hope most hopeless moments there was always a little light of hope and and and that's thanks to what started that day when I was 14 years old down on Jekyll Island at a Baptist church camp.

201
00:26:02.56 --> 00:26:17.56
I'm talking a little bit about just because the way you said that but also because you may have been born again but you you're not a saint at this point play mighty stretch and we'll get into some of that stuff.

202
00:26:17.56 --> 00:26:35.56
You may not have been always walking the enlightened path along the way that's a fair assessment. So you roll into high school and you're six to 140 pounds which I didn't I was 100% sure that was possible.

203
00:26:35.56 --> 00:26:46.56
I got Charles assessment. So what's what's your deal in high school. What are you thinking about what's going on in high school.

204
00:26:46.56 --> 00:27:05.56
I'm riding the bench playing football. You know I was basically six to 140 pounds and seventh grade. So I was the big and then just never and no additional development there. But I knew I wanted to get out.

205
00:27:05.56 --> 00:27:15.56
I knew I was getting somewhere and I knew that the chaos and the dysfunction of my childhood that I was getting out.

206
00:27:16.56 --> 00:27:29.56
And initially I viewed that as you go to college is how you get out of this situation. No one in my family had been to college but I knew that my friends who seemed to have more stability like their parents went to college.

207
00:27:29.56 --> 00:27:40.56
And so that that was really the goal and then I thought you know I don't know what jobs professional jobs are. I know there are doctors and lawyers.

208
00:27:41.56 --> 00:27:50.56
And so like I know I'm not going to be a doctor. So that means I could be a lawyer. And so I would do the debate team. Yeah you.

209
00:27:50.56 --> 00:28:05.56
Yeah you went full nerd. Right. Is that a hundred percent. National Honor Society Drama Club Speech and Debate Team Treasure of the Service Club President of the Ecology Club. Yeah.

210
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:14.56
You went full. That's the hippie mom part. I got president of the Ecology Club plus my AP bio teacher was the and I wasn't doing too well in AP bio.

211
00:28:14.56 --> 00:28:36.56
I yeah. Is this a Catholic school. Yes. Boys. All boys. Yes. All boys. Yeah. How was that. Loved it. It was a blast. I mean it's there's no egos there's nobody trying to impress anybody it's just guys being dudes and having like it was a ton of fun.

212
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:50.56
Absolutely. We're in a uniform every day. Yes. Where'd your mom get money for this school. Yeah so she took out a loan her first second mortgage for the house for us to go to school.

213
00:28:50.56 --> 00:29:06.56
And that's why I always felt like I had to honor you know her sacrifice because she's working her ass off and making all these sacrifices that I felt you know in turn a duty and obligation to her.

214
00:29:06.56 --> 00:29:19.56
And so I took my studies really seriously in high school and I was was was doing whatever I could to make sure that her investment in me was there would be a return on it.

215
00:29:20.56 --> 00:29:31.56
And so that's part of why I was in all these clubs. Yeah I thought I'll go to college I'll be a lawyer and then I'll be able to take care of everybody and that's kind of what I was thinking in high school.

216
00:29:31.56 --> 00:29:46.56
Now September 11th happens. What year are you in sophomore sophomore. Did that start to make you think about joining the military. It's why I'm in the military.

217
00:29:47.56 --> 00:29:57.56
It made me think you know at that point it was still the age of innocence or ignorance you didn't know that at least I didn't know that there were bad people in the world who wanted to do the U.S. harm.

218
00:29:57.56 --> 00:30:07.56
And so it was initially very confusing. But by the end of that day I knew at some point I'll do something about that.

219
00:30:08.56 --> 00:30:15.56
And so I knew I'd serve. I didn't know I joined the ring core. I didn't even probably know there was a branch called the Marine Corps and I wasn't G.I. Joe.

220
00:30:16.56 --> 00:30:23.56
I wasn't you know didn't have a dad in the house wasn't doing like man stuff. I just knew like hey somebody's got to do something about that.

221
00:30:23.56 --> 00:30:30.56
You should do that. And that is put me on a trajectory of where I am sitting here today.

222
00:30:31.56 --> 00:30:42.56
So you apply to college. You get into Loyola University Chicago. Is that a good school. I don't even know. I'm sorry.

223
00:30:43.56 --> 00:30:50.56
It's all right. Yeah it's pretty good. Pretty good school. Yeah pretty good school. Hard to get into. I don't. I mean I think maybe.

224
00:30:50.56 --> 00:30:56.56
You're Alma Mater is going to come at you. Yeah. Hell yeah it's hard to get. Yeah it's super hard to get into. It's elite.

225
00:30:58.56 --> 00:31:07.56
So you get in there. You're kind of stoked but you don't have any money to pay for college. And this is where you first kind of discover NROTC.

226
00:31:07.56 --> 00:31:22.56
Yeah. It's Ivy League of the Midwest. There we go. OK. Yeah I you know no one is no one I'm not able to talk to kind of anybody about going to college.

227
00:31:23.56 --> 00:31:35.56
I don't know anything about going to college. And so well after all the scholarship applications are already passed and well after like OK so I'm in the college like how am I going to pay for it.

228
00:31:35.56 --> 00:31:48.56
And so I Google. Well there wasn't Google on AOL. You know looking up college scholarships and I find that that there's this thing called ROTC and that they pay for your tuition.

229
00:31:49.56 --> 00:31:57.56
And I said well I want to serve anyways. This could be a thing. And when I call them like yeah the scholarship window closed like six months ago.

230
00:31:57.56 --> 00:32:06.56
But you could do it for free. And maybe if you're in a couple of years you can you can pick up the scholarship. And I thought well I got no other.

231
00:32:07.56 --> 00:32:11.56
Nothing else going for me. So I'll try this. And so that's how I ended up in ROTC.

232
00:32:12.56 --> 00:32:20.56
It sounds like you were a little unimpressed in the book with the Navy when you like what you had in your mind for what military service would be like.

233
00:32:21.56 --> 00:32:25.56
And then you showed up in the Navy. You didn't really impress you too much at the ROTC branch at Loyola Chicago.

234
00:32:25.56 --> 00:32:34.56
Sure. I the only thing I still kind of thought I'd be a lawyer. And my grandma had a big crush on Tom Cruise.

235
00:32:35.56 --> 00:32:39.56
I'd seen a few good men. And so I think well that'll make it happen.

236
00:32:40.56 --> 00:32:49.56
And so my mom is really against it. But she thinks oh well you're going to be Tom Cruise in this movie. It's not a big it's may not terrible.

237
00:32:49.56 --> 00:32:57.56
And then I go to my little ROTC orientation week and we go up the Great Lakes Naval Base and get marched around and yell that.

238
00:32:58.56 --> 00:33:05.56
And it's just it's just clear like the Marine staff the Navy staff and then the midshipmen who are first class who are going to commission the Marine Corps.

239
00:33:06.56 --> 00:33:12.56
And I just said I don't know but it looks like these guys have these guys have something that this other group doesn't.

240
00:33:12.56 --> 00:33:21.56
And so I think I want to go. And so that was my still not knowing anything about the Marine Corps not knowing what infantry was not knowing expeditionary.

241
00:33:22.56 --> 00:33:26.56
None of this kind of stuff. I just know that like it seems like they got their shit together and I want to be like those guys.

242
00:33:27.56 --> 00:33:28.56
He picked Colonel Jessup.

243
00:33:31.56 --> 00:33:36.56
Yeah you know that I had a conversation with a good friend of mine who's a who's a regular Navy guy.

244
00:33:36.56 --> 00:33:42.56
And he said something you know we are just he's deeply involved with the SEAL community now.

245
00:33:43.56 --> 00:33:55.56
But we we just had a quick conversation about you know like the Navy versus the SEAL teams because when people go to Buds if they don't make it through Buds they're in the Navy.

246
00:33:56.56 --> 00:34:04.56
And the job for someone that wants to go to Buds that doesn't make it and ends up in the Navy is not the job that they're looking for.

247
00:34:04.56 --> 00:34:17.56
If you go into the Army and you want to be a special forces soldier and you don't make it cool you can be a rifleman in the 82nd Airborne 101st Airborne or that's still an outstanding job and you're doing something proximal to what you want to do.

248
00:34:18.56 --> 00:34:19.56
The Navy is not like that.

249
00:34:20.56 --> 00:34:22.56
And he said well you know that makes makes it sound like my job was horrible.

250
00:34:22.56 --> 00:34:36.56
And I said no not at all. It's just that there's certain people that are attracted certain jobs and I told them this story that I've told 100 times about I'm on an LPD you know amphibious ship out here off the coast of San Diego.

251
00:34:37.56 --> 00:34:44.56
We're 30 miles off of Pendleton. We're about to go do a hydrographic reconnaissance. The freaking waves are huge. It's raining and miserable.

252
00:34:44.56 --> 00:34:58.56
And I'm standing I'm standing there getting these you know getting ready to launch our Zodiacs off the back of this LPD and this Boson's mate first class and it's you know it's whatever 10 o'clock at night storms.

253
00:34:59.56 --> 00:35:06.56
And he looks at me and he looks out there and he looks back at me and he goes man I'm glad I don't have your job and I looked back at him and I said well I'm glad I don't have yours.

254
00:35:07.56 --> 00:35:08.56
So there you go. You're like everyone's got their own little thing.

255
00:35:08.56 --> 00:35:16.56
So that's why when you look at people that are in Navy ROTC they're a different type of person than the type of person.

256
00:35:17.56 --> 00:35:26.56
There's people that look at Marines and go oh hell no I'm not doing that because they look at the Navy people like oh they look like they're going to be doing some finance and some working on engine engineers and like this kind of thing.

257
00:35:27.56 --> 00:35:31.56
It's just it's just a propensity of job that people want.

258
00:35:31.56 --> 00:35:40.56
And you looked at the Navy guys and said they look like they're going to be engineers and these guys over here look like they're going to carry machine guns and you're a machine gun carrying type of dude.

259
00:35:41.56 --> 00:35:41.56
A firm.

260
00:35:42.56 --> 00:35:46.56
So but you still have you see you still don't have a scholarship yet.

261
00:35:47.56 --> 00:35:52.56
So you're at this point you're working at Costco you're time you're changing tires which is a rewarding job.

262
00:35:53.56 --> 00:35:57.56
Yeah someone brings you something that's damaged broken and then you give back to them and it works again.

263
00:35:57.56 --> 00:36:08.56
And I thought this was cool you had a guy so now it's your junior year and your gunny gunny steel tells you that your grades your grades aren't good enough for a for a scholarship.

264
00:36:09.56 --> 00:36:13.56
And he says you know what you better do is you better go to this platoon leaders class.

265
00:36:14.56 --> 00:36:16.56
So explain the explain the platoon leaders class.

266
00:36:17.56 --> 00:36:25.56
There are a couple different ways to commission as an officer you can go to the academies are one commissioning source you can do it through ROTC.

267
00:36:25.56 --> 00:36:33.56
And then there's you can do it through OCC meaning you've already graduated college and you can just do a little 10 week thing or you can kind of hit two summers during your college year.

268
00:36:34.56 --> 00:36:36.56
This platoon leaders class course PLC.

269
00:36:37.56 --> 00:36:38.56
And so you do two six week hits.

270
00:36:39.56 --> 00:36:49.56
And so since I still didn't have a scholarship going into my junior year and I wanted to be a Marine I was advised that this was probably the route I would need to go.

271
00:36:49.56 --> 00:36:57.56
And so I went to what's called PLC juniors and it was a very good learning experience.

272
00:36:58.56 --> 00:36:59.56
We talked about learning experiences before we started today.

273
00:37:00.56 --> 00:37:01.56
Yes we did.

274
00:37:02.56 --> 00:37:03.56
And people still learning all the time.

275
00:37:04.56 --> 00:37:16.56
And and you know I'm so jacked up like you know more f'd up than a football bat as they'll say you know I probably needed an extra go.

276
00:37:16.56 --> 00:37:20.56
And so I think ultimately there was there's a lot of benefit in that six weeks.

277
00:37:21.56 --> 00:37:27.56
But and I think my gunnery sergeant recognized that I probably could use a little extra training.

278
00:37:28.56 --> 00:37:35.56
And so I think he withheld some information there until graduation rehearsal.

279
00:37:36.56 --> 00:37:38.56
And he said you know it's human you had the scholarship.

280
00:37:39.56 --> 00:37:41.56
I just didn't tell you so congratulations.

281
00:37:41.56 --> 00:37:48.56
So instead of spending six weeks hanging out with your friends or whatever you spent six weeks doing Marine Corps stuff.

282
00:37:49.56 --> 00:37:49.56
Yeah down in Quantico.

283
00:37:50.56 --> 00:37:50.56
Where's that at Quantico.

284
00:37:51.56 --> 00:37:52.56
How was that course.

285
00:37:54.56 --> 00:37:57.56
When I went to down six it was it was tough.

286
00:37:58.56 --> 00:38:01.56
I don't want to tell you know too many OCS war stories because I'll get heckled.

287
00:38:02.56 --> 00:38:09.56
But I thought it was it was this guy Colonel Chase used to stand at the top of the hill and just say like quick candidate you shouldn't be here.

288
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:10.56
You worthless like.

289
00:38:11.56 --> 00:38:16.56
And then when I went back in 07 it was a new CEO and and I think we the surge was happening.

290
00:38:17.56 --> 00:38:18.56
So we needed to make sure people got through.

291
00:38:19.56 --> 00:38:28.56
And so I'll tell you you know one thing that I'll never you know I always remember from that 06 is I had this mean as hell sergeant instructors.

292
00:38:29.56 --> 00:38:30.56
Efo he was a mean mean man.

293
00:38:30.56 --> 00:38:39.56
And every night we would hold the M16 by the front side tip between our thumb and our index finger fully extended straight forward.

294
00:38:40.56 --> 00:38:50.56
And he would say discipline is and we scream instant willingness and obedience to orders and say discipline is instant willingness and obedience to orders.

295
00:38:51.56 --> 00:38:52.56
And so we just do that over and over again.

296
00:38:52.56 --> 00:39:00.56
And I've I've always thought that's that's shaped how I think about discipline and.

297
00:39:01.56 --> 00:39:07.56
You know close order drill is the most basic form of discipline.

298
00:39:08.56 --> 00:39:14.56
It's it's it's the most rudimentary basic form of discipline that we have that we build off in the military.

299
00:39:15.56 --> 00:39:19.56
Then there's then you do battle drills which are another form of discipline.

300
00:39:19.56 --> 00:39:25.56
You do immediate action drills another kind of it's all all this ties into just instant willingness and obedience to orders.

301
00:39:26.56 --> 00:39:28.56
A drill is so that you you don't have to think about it.

302
00:39:29.56 --> 00:39:31.56
You know and so thumb clip twist pull pin frag out right.

303
00:39:32.56 --> 00:39:43.56
And so that's a battle drill or contact left and it's all predicated on a drill something that you do over and over again until it becomes less thinking.

304
00:39:43.56 --> 00:39:52.56
And and when you why do you do this it reduces the need of physical courage when something is drilled into you.

305
00:39:53.56 --> 00:39:57.56
It's you're not relying so much on your physical courage in that moment.

306
00:39:57.56 --> 00:40:17.56
And what I what I've been thinking about as I continue my career in the Marine Corps is is when you become more senior you actually need a lot more discipline than when you are PFC or last corporal or junior officer.

307
00:40:18.56 --> 00:40:23.56
When you are a PFC or junior in the organization so much your life is dictated to you.

308
00:40:23.56 --> 00:40:40.56
So there's not a lot of opportunity to do things that are undisciplined and and and as you become senior you have more opportunity to discern what you what routes you want to go.

309
00:40:41.56 --> 00:40:51.56
And the thing is that as you get more latitude or more freedom you have the potential to be less disciplined.

310
00:40:51.56 --> 00:40:59.56
And I think when you think of the hard thing is usually the right thing and the right thing is usually the hard thing.

311
00:41:00.56 --> 00:41:09.56
And as and as you advance in this organization it requires you to have discipline to continue to do the hard and right thing.

312
00:41:10.56 --> 00:41:14.56
And it's not that you would do the wrong thing you would just do the less right thing.

313
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:38.56
And so I can just cut this little corner and be like well you know like I've been here for 15 years like do I really need to do like I'll generally kind of get it in the box but I don't have to do all these little and so I find that that discipline in your habits and your actions and in your thoughts.

314
00:41:38.56 --> 00:41:43.56
That helps you because otherwise you're relying on moral courage.

315
00:41:43.56 --> 00:42:10.56
And so if physical courage if you rely less on physical courage through battle drills and immediate action drills and close order drill you you you rely less on moral courage when you have discipline thoughts habits and actions in your life and so that that way it's not I don't have to say I don't need to put myself in a position where my moral courage has to carry the day for me to do get up in the morning to like my boss like we have to be at work at 6 30 p.t.n.

316
00:42:10.56 --> 00:42:35.56
No one's checking if I'm there at 6 30 like I'm the opposite I could probably come in at 6 40 6 45 you know and but by having the discipline of getting up when my alarm goes off at 5 am every day I reduce the need to have the moral courage to kind of make that decision and same thing with you know if you don't put ice cream in your freezer it's not a matter of discipline at that point.

317
00:42:35.56 --> 00:42:42.56
It's I had the discipline not to buy it at the store because otherwise if it's in the freezer every time I walk by the fridge it's a matter of moral courage.

318
00:42:43.56 --> 00:42:46.56
Do I have the moral courage you're talking in Echo's world right now.

319
00:42:47.56 --> 00:42:50.56
Echo also equates moral courage with avoid the ice cream.

320
00:42:51.56 --> 00:42:56.56
It's always surprising or not always but a lot of times people are surprised that in basic seal training.

321
00:42:56.56 --> 00:43:05.56
You have weekends off you go do whatever you want you can you can do whatever you want you can go get drunk you can go party you can you can get crazy.

322
00:43:05.56 --> 00:43:28.56
And that's part of the test because once you're in the sale teams there's there's literally no one cares if you're showing up to PT now if you go out on a rock comp and you can't hang you're going to get destroyed but they want people that find that that that will discipline themselves that have the self discipline because and that's there there's been plenty of people that didn't make it through seal training because they were because they didn't want to.

323
00:43:28.56 --> 00:43:35.56
Have discipline on the weekends just to do what they should be doing and said they went and did what they wanted to do so that that's interesting.

324
00:43:36.56 --> 00:43:41.56
The other thing is man as you get older and you get more senior and you can start cutting some corners.

325
00:43:44.56 --> 00:43:45.56
Every single person.

326
00:43:45.56 --> 00:44:01.56
Below you in the chain of command can see it and this is where I got very lucky because I was a I was prime listed so I was the youngest and most junior guy in my first two platoons which thank God what a what a freaking incredible opportunity but I would watch.

327
00:44:01.56 --> 00:44:15.56
I would watch my platoon chief I would watch my platoon commander and if they were three minutes late I was tracking it they forgot a piece of gear I was tracking they needed a little extra something to get need a little help getting up the ladder I was tracking it.

328
00:44:15.56 --> 00:44:30.56
So when I moved into a leadership position I always felt those eyes man I felt those eyes all the time and I didn't want to let those guys down so so that's something that always weighed on me and then the last thing you know when we when we start talking about.

329
00:44:31.56 --> 00:44:42.56
You know immediate action drills and battle drills what's really awesome is because sometimes people think oh so what you have is a bunch of robots you know you've trained a bunch of robots just do whatever you say.

330
00:44:42.56 --> 00:44:50.56
No actually you get these battle drills down you get people it's like the plenty musical instruments negative.

331
00:44:51.56 --> 00:44:58.56
So guitar which I play I'm not good at it but Jimmy Page who played for the band Led Zeppelin.

332
00:44:58.56 --> 00:45:18.56
I go Charles we good sir okay he was a studio musician for years which meant he went into a student he was very well known as a studio meaning they would tell him exactly what to play and he would play the notes they wanted him to play and he did that for forever just highly disciplined mechanical playing of the instrument.

333
00:45:18.56 --> 00:45:34.56
And that's how he made a living for a long time and because he had all that discipline because he knew every fret and every note and how to bend them and how to how to manipulate him he knew them so well that when he got into Led Zeppelin now all of a sudden he could take those things and break rules.

334
00:45:34.56 --> 00:45:55.56
So what you end up with like in a seal platoon especially like a new guy in a seal platoon they're they're a robot for a little while you want to make sure that their weapons always painted pointed safe direction they know exactly where the other people are during a during an immediate action drill that they're doing the safe thing so you drill them so it becomes mechanical.

335
00:45:55.56 --> 00:46:06.56
And then once they start getting it now all of a sudden they can start saying wait I know I'm supposed to be over here but I can provide better cover for my other squad if I.

336
00:46:07.56 --> 00:46:15.56
Scurry up this little this little mound of dirt a little bit and it's still in a safe zone because I'm not getting in front of anything I'm not cutting out cutting off anyone's field of fire so boom.

337
00:46:15.56 --> 00:46:27.56
And so you even have the the front line shooters the new guys after a little while they're starting to think but they know the rules they know the rules so well that they can really think they can go right to the edge of that box.

338
00:46:27.56 --> 00:46:41.56
They can go they can go right up to the edge that berm that they know if they go any further they're going to cut off someone else's field of fire they know that so you get them so well trained and so well disciplined that they end up with a bunch of freedom and then that goes all the way up the chain now the guys that have got two

339
00:46:41.56 --> 00:47:01.56
platoons under the belt they can start making little adjustments with their whole fire team and then eventually you get a platoon commander that goes oh here's the rule right now and here's what I should do but I actually see something that I can do that doesn't break the rules but it bends them and it's going to give us a better opportunity to get a bigger bite on on this on this battlefield right now.

340
00:47:01.56 --> 00:47:17.56
So those immediate action drills and like close order drill boom like we are doing without thinking and you got to have that but then we get to the actual immediate action drills people start to understand the concepts of what we're doing and then they understand the parameters.

341
00:47:18.56 --> 00:47:20.56
You know there's certain certain notes on a guitar.

342
00:47:21.56 --> 00:47:27.56
If you play this note then you play this other note it's not it doesn't work literally doesn't work the whole world will go that sounds like shit like everyone will think that.

343
00:47:27.56 --> 00:47:55.56
So when a guy is good at I ads are good at moving through a mountain environment when they're good at it they understand oh I can do this right here I can actually play this note I can play this note over here I can bend that note here's something I can't play that note over there it's not going to work and that's what we want we want people we want thinking shooters we want people that are understand that are so disciplined that they can actually have more freedom out there and that's what always is the goal you know.

344
00:47:55.56 --> 00:48:04.56
And in the beginning that means we need to be highly disciplined and never you know when you're going through basic seal training.

345
00:48:05.56 --> 00:48:15.56
If you make a tiny mistake it's it's it's like you're getting swarmed by instructors they do not want you to make it like you will not sweep someone.

346
00:48:15.56 --> 00:48:35.56
You will not give give a seal that's you know in his first platoon give him a squirt gun and you give him that squirt gun and he's going to like immediately have the best muscle discipline and you've ever seen like he won't point it at his kid to squirt me like it's like a physical like yeah I can't point this squirt gun at my son because it just doesn't feel right.

347
00:48:35.56 --> 00:48:48.56
That's how like ingrained it is and that's what you want that discipline is embedded in their brains and then over time they go OK now I have such a good foundation to work with my mind can be free.

348
00:48:49.56 --> 00:48:50.56
That's the goal.

349
00:48:50.56 --> 00:49:03.56
So you got some of that stuff drilled into you. I'm going to jump into the book here for a second in my senior year with a scholarship I was over the hump money wise but there was a new problem.

350
00:49:04.56 --> 00:49:13.56
My metabolism slowed down and my regular diet of pizza and beer suddenly started yielding different results on my permanent perennial skinny frame.

351
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:25.56
I wasn't prepared for the metabolic cost of that in the appearance is reality Marine Corps where fitness is a virtue superseding most flaws in the core.

352
00:49:26.56 --> 00:49:28.56
Fatness is an unpardonable sin.

353
00:49:29.56 --> 00:49:33.56
Gunny steel again took me on and as as a personal mission.

354
00:49:34.56 --> 00:49:40.56
He was the picture perfect Marine thin haircut high and tight multiple meritorious promotions because he was genuinely squared away Marine.

355
00:49:40.56 --> 00:49:46.56
I still kept my eyes peeled for him whenever I was at Northwestern trying to avoid him and heavy objects.

356
00:49:47.56 --> 00:49:48.56
But one day he called me on my cell phone.

357
00:49:49.56 --> 00:49:50.56
There was no avoiding him.

358
00:49:51.56 --> 00:49:52.56
He ordered me to come to his office.

359
00:49:53.56 --> 00:49:53.56
That was never good.

360
00:49:54.56 --> 00:49:54.56
This was no different.

361
00:49:55.56 --> 00:49:57.56
Schumann Schumann.

362
00:49:58.56 --> 00:50:01.56
You might let yourself become a fat piece of shit but I ain't.

363
00:50:02.56 --> 00:50:04.56
We ain't commissioning a pig to lead Marines.

364
00:50:04.56 --> 00:50:09.56
Normally I would have at least offered I I Gunny but I was stunned in the silence.

365
00:50:10.56 --> 00:50:15.56
He continued you're going to come here coming here every morning for PT after that you're going to have uniform inspection every day.

366
00:50:16.56 --> 00:50:19.56
Every day of your life is going to be the worst day of your life until you conform to standards.

367
00:50:20.56 --> 00:50:20.56
Boom.

368
00:50:21.56 --> 00:50:22.56
There you go.

369
00:50:23.56 --> 00:50:31.56
Yeah I was lacking some discipline for sure and it caught up to me and and we talked about again before we started about how good friends tell you what you need to hear.

370
00:50:31.56 --> 00:50:33.56
And nobody told me I was getting fat.

371
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:37.56
So I don't want to like not take accountability for my own fatness.

372
00:50:38.56 --> 00:50:40.56
But like I didn't think it was possible.

373
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:51.56
You know I'd always been a rail ski like it when I would go up in waist size I was like it's guess it's time for new pants like it was nothing was clicking that I was getting fat.

374
00:50:52.56 --> 00:50:56.56
And you like the slow boat the boiling frog right that doesn't notice that the waters.

375
00:50:57.56 --> 00:50:58.56
Exactly looks like a size 42.

376
00:50:58.56 --> 00:51:03.56
And he got me squared away.

377
00:51:04.56 --> 00:51:17.56
I had one of my friends he's in the SEAL teams and he had a guy that was that was not to standards and he brought him into his office and says hey bro there's no fat SEALs and you're fat editing.

378
00:51:18.56 --> 00:51:20.56
You're going to start taking the PRT until you're good to go.

379
00:51:20.56 --> 00:51:30.56
So sometimes that direct approach with PRT physical readiness test which again in the SEAL teams there's not there's not there's not a bunch of people tracking you.

380
00:51:31.56 --> 00:51:41.56
And there was years ago by where the guy a guy can you know I had a trip wasn't there for the PRT because like a command like the SEAL team would do one PRT a year.

381
00:51:42.56 --> 00:51:47.56
And you'd see it you know months in advance I go the PRT is on October 15th or whatever.

382
00:51:47.56 --> 00:51:51.56
So if a guy is like cool I'm taking leave or I'm going to go on a trip October 15th he's not there.

383
00:51:52.56 --> 00:51:55.56
You do that three years in a row your pants size can be a 46.

384
00:51:56.56 --> 00:52:00.56
What is it though like a performance or physical.

385
00:52:01.56 --> 00:52:06.56
It's like a three mile run push ups pull ups swim something like that.

386
00:52:07.56 --> 00:52:13.56
So technically you could get gain a bunch of weight still pass that thing and be good to go or what you could but you probably wouldn't be able to pass it.

387
00:52:13.56 --> 00:52:29.56
If and you know it's weird to like this goes back and forth the Navy has a PRT the regular Navy and the SEALs for a while use the Navy PRT but that one you probably could be out of shape like from a SEAL perspective and still be able to pass.

388
00:52:29.56 --> 00:52:43.56
So then the SEALs made their own PRT that just to make sure you don't have anybody that's not you know because there's no fast SEALs like just to enforce that rule without having to tell anybody like here's the PRT if you don't pass it you got to get on the run program homie.

389
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:51.56
Yeah but it's not like the kind you're measuring body fat or nothing like this and be like hey you're over you know 14 percent or whatever.

390
00:52:52.56 --> 00:52:53.56
We do have that as well.

391
00:52:53.56 --> 00:53:14.56
Oh for real if you're out of there there are height and weight standards and every year you're supposed to get height and weight and if and if you don't make weight you get taped and if you're not within tape then you get put on the BCP program what we call and basically you're on the fat body program and you got to do weekly check ins and what's

392
00:53:14.56 --> 00:53:22.56
tape is they measure your to get your body fat percentage so they measure like your waist your chest your arms that kind of excels.

393
00:53:23.56 --> 00:53:25.56
That goes wonder if there's a way to get involved in that.

394
00:53:27.56 --> 00:53:28.56
Could I do a pose down or what.

395
00:53:28.56 --> 00:53:46.56
No I mean like the body weight I got taped my whole career because if you're like if you're bigger and stronger you're going to get taped because you know like for me the max body weight or something for a guy that's five eleven was like you know one seventy eight or something

396
00:53:46.56 --> 00:54:00.56
maybe like one eighty two or something like that and I would I would two twenty five and so they tape you know go yeah you're just you're just a big stronger also it's probably like a ratio then it's not like hey your waist is over this therefore you're out kind of yeah

397
00:54:00.56 --> 00:54:16.56
because you know you get these bigger guys who can you know they can do the PRT yeah and but there yeah two twenty five two thirty five but they can perform it that you know like you can't measure like that you know where it's like oh but you're overweight doesn't make sense.

398
00:54:17.56 --> 00:54:23.56
Yeah no they have a ratio and then I never like had any issue with the tape at all I mean it was like good to go.

399
00:54:24.56 --> 00:54:25.56
What about the PRT have you ever had issues with it.

400
00:54:26.56 --> 00:54:27.56
No PRT good to go.

401
00:54:27.56 --> 00:54:41.56
Good to go. No you gotta be if you work out regularly you're gonna you're gonna pass the PRT so you gotta be a slacker dude and like they're not that kind of this is a rare dude in the SEAL teams that just gives up.

402
00:54:42.56 --> 00:54:46.56
I mean you're not wearing a shirt like eighty seven percent of the time.

403
00:54:47.56 --> 00:54:48.56
Like if you're not in the field you're not wearing a shirt.

404
00:54:48.56 --> 00:55:03.56
So if you're you know you're walking around every day and you're just putting on the LB there's not too many occasionally it happens occasionally it happens but most of the time and not to mention like the actual physical part of the job.

405
00:55:03.56 --> 00:55:22.56
If you're not in good shape you're gonna get fired like if you can't go out and walk around the desert with you know a hundred pounds and do it and hang you're gonna get fired you won't be in a platoon so no and I guess if you don't want to be in a SEAL platoon which is a weird thing to even be.

406
00:55:23.56 --> 00:55:24.56
Right at that point for sure.

407
00:55:24.56 --> 00:55:33.56
So you got on the run program. Yep. Gunny Steel straightened your ass out for a second time. Sure did. We appreciate we appreciate him.

408
00:55:34.56 --> 00:55:44.56
Love him. This is the this is the the non-commissioned officers that that make the that make the Marine Corps what it is make the Navy what it is make the military what it is. Absolutely.

409
00:55:45.56 --> 00:55:49.56
By keeping the young J.O.'s in line and often the senior O.'s as well. Yeah.

410
00:55:49.56 --> 00:56:01.56
You seen up graduating which is awesome and you had to get laser eye surgery. So you get commissioned they cover that but that that makes it a little time for you to go to the basic school.

411
00:56:02.56 --> 00:56:09.56
Now at the basic school you still thinking you still might be Tom Cruise at this point. It seems like in the book you were still thinking it could be Tom Cruise.

412
00:56:10.56 --> 00:56:13.56
No you've got to go into that with a law contract.

413
00:56:13.56 --> 00:56:20.56
So pilots and lawyers aren't competing at the basic school. They've already got their their contracts ahead of time. Got it.

414
00:56:21.56 --> 00:56:30.56
I didn't know what I wanted to be when I was heading into the basic school. It's in there. I don't know. I discover pretty quickly what I wanted to be.

415
00:56:31.56 --> 00:56:35.56
Field exercise one. Yes. That's what changed your mind. Yes. Tell us about field exercise one.

416
00:56:35.56 --> 00:56:43.56
So you know even though I got to do a little summers with my dad and pretend to be a cowboy I still didn't know anything about being outside. I didn't know how to camp. I didn't know how to.

417
00:56:44.56 --> 00:56:59.56
And we got our class picked up in October. So our first field exercise is in sometime in mid mid November and it got down to five degrees and everybody canteens were frozen.

418
00:56:59.56 --> 00:57:16.56
No one knew like put the canteen upside down or put in your sleeping bag with you. You try to bite in the MREs like breaking your teeth off like all are like cold leather gears. Super old sucks and like don't know how to layer.

419
00:57:17.56 --> 00:57:27.56
Don't know anything about how to live outside in the cold at least the majority of us. And so you know up until that point everybody kind of talks about oh we're going to be infantry.

420
00:57:27.56 --> 00:57:35.56
I'm going to be infantry. I'm going to be infantry. And at that point I know what I wanted to do like tanks sound cool or this sounds cool like artillery sounds cool.

421
00:57:36.56 --> 00:57:50.56
But at the end of the effects one field exercise one. No one wanted to be infantry. And I was just like well shit if you all don't want to do that. It makes me want to do that.

422
00:57:50.56 --> 00:58:04.56
And so it's kind of like just a response to my environment when people don't want to challenge or people don't. I want to I want the opposite. And so I was like well now I do want to be infantry and and and that's that was my I did.

423
00:58:04.56 --> 00:58:19.56
I still had no idea what that actually meant beyond that it was a response to what other people didn't want. It wasn't until I got out in the woods that I knew at Amtrakh course I said yes yes this is the right place but that was still to come.

424
00:58:20.56 --> 00:58:21.56
And how was the basic school for you.

425
00:58:21.56 --> 00:58:38.56
It you know the college the big suck. I mean it was it was it was challenging it was not like extremely challenging it was it was more a grind than anything it's just six months is a long time.

426
00:58:38.56 --> 00:58:51.56
And and so I think I've gone back to Quantico a couple of times when I've taken the midshipment down there and I've got to talk to some of the instructors and see their the POI down there now I think it's I think it's really good.

427
00:58:52.56 --> 00:58:55.56
It was just long. It was long. That's what it was.

428
00:58:56.56 --> 00:59:05.56
Now when you're going through that are you getting is it like Ranger school you like get put in leadership position in a patrol you take it out you get graded then the next one you're a machine gun or the next one you're a point man.

429
00:59:05.56 --> 00:59:09.56
Yep. So you're getting good experience in the field. Sure. Yeah.

430
00:59:10.56 --> 00:59:22.56
There's there's several field exercises. Everybody's getting rotated through leadership billets and you know the goal is to make every Marine officer able to lead a basic rifle platoon.

431
00:59:23.56 --> 00:59:33.56
That's the intent of putting we're the only service that that puts you know our pilots and our lawyers and our adjutants all through this this course where they're we're going out training as riflemen.

432
00:59:33.56 --> 00:59:38.56
Every Marine's rifleman. Was it hard to get selected for infantry.

433
00:59:38.56 --> 01:00:02.56
Yeah. So by the time Sleshing came down I know what's like 300 in a in a in a one class Alpha company and I think there's maybe 3040 infantry slots out of that and I mean I remember you were I was first platoon and we were when the SBC the platoon commander is reading out who got what I'm

434
01:00:02.56 --> 01:00:13.56
There was a dude who was solid his dad was Sergeant Major and he didn't get it. I thought oh well he's like way more squared away than me. Maybe maybe I'm not going to get it.

435
01:00:14.56 --> 01:00:28.56
So yeah I think it was competitive for sure. Is that because like the talent spread thing. Yeah. So it's top third middle third bottom third so that you have a quality spread across that that that right there.

436
01:00:28.56 --> 01:00:40.56
That concept is what shows you that the Marine Corps puts the Marine Corps first. Oh yeah it really is. So what it is Echo Charles is when you go to the basic school.

437
01:00:41.56 --> 01:00:56.56
You'd think number one guy would get the number one pick. What does he want to do. Number two guy get the number two pick. But then everyone would pick the the jobs like the good jobs the cool jobs and the people at the bottom would get you know whatever is considered a crappy job.

438
01:00:56.56 --> 01:01:11.56
So instead what they do is they cut the class up into thirds. The first guy in the first group gets the first pick. The first guy in the second group. So out of 100 this guy might be the hundred or the hundred and first guy.

439
01:01:11.56 --> 01:01:29.56
So right. No the two hundred and first guy gets the second pick the three hundred and first guy gets the third pick. So you end up with this quality getting spread through all the different jobs in the Marine Corps. So it's not like there's some category of of Marines of Marine

440
01:01:29.56 --> 01:01:45.56
officers that are all just like oh they're just like the lowest ranking guys are just terrible. No it's you get an even spread across the board. And that is a thing that tells you that the Marine Corps puts the Marine Corps the whole Marine Corps first.

441
01:01:46.56 --> 01:01:55.56
That is one of the clearest indicators in history that we want everyone in the Marine Corps to have an opportunity and the Marine Corps comes first. Oh yeah.

442
01:01:55.56 --> 01:02:13.56
Wait. So what are they based that on like the. Yeah. Throughout the six months it's academic. There's leadership scores a PT score your rifle score. So there's there's several kind of scores that are calculated into your overall class ranking largely academic but definitely like leadership evaluations all kind of.

443
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:34.56
I always say like I only think that I got it because we were in the defense and the ground was frozen in my SBC and I was a machine gunner and I just had a pickaxe and I was right next to a tree with big roots and he walked by and is hitting this ground and literally not just the shovels bouncing off.

444
01:02:34.56 --> 01:02:46.56
He's like what are you trying to do there. I'm getting a chest deep fighting hole sir. On that ground you're not like chuckled and walked away several hours later comes by. How's that going. Shuman. I'm like two inches deep.

445
01:02:47.56 --> 01:02:56.56
He's like I'm away sir. And then by day three he goes by and he's like this guy's maybe just stubborn enough to be a grunt. I'm sitting in a chest deep fighting hole.

446
01:02:56.56 --> 01:03:09.56
I always think like maybe that's I think that's my how I got selected. Dude I got this story from Hackworth that I read the other day and I got I got to like do more with it but he's in Korea.

447
01:03:10.56 --> 01:03:15.56
And he's freezing and he wants to go home.

448
01:03:15.56 --> 01:03:35.56
And he figures out a plan in in like when the sun goes down he starts to freeze he's like I'm out of here how can I get out of here so what he plans to do is he's going to dig a hole big enough to put his leg in and he's going to toss a grenade into this hole and blow his leg up get some shrapnel and go home.

449
01:03:35.56 --> 01:03:52.56
So the sun goes down he's a little bit funny he starts digging man it's the same thing he digs and he starts digging and he's digging and he's digging he's digging through the night and right as he's finishing up this hole and he's getting to a point where he can finally throw this grenade in there and go home.

450
01:03:52.56 --> 01:04:07.56
The sun starts to come up and he's like you know what I got this but it's a it's a good thing to remember that when it really sucks the sun's gonna come up at some point and you'll start to get warm again push through it.

451
01:04:07.56 --> 01:04:22.56
And it's good lesson that it's not easy to dig and frozen ground.

452
01:04:22.56 --> 01:04:38.56
He was done he was done it's like Dick Winters you know Dick Winters after everything he did in World War two they brought all they got recalled for Korea he showed up to the boat there in San Francisco and they're like hey if you're a combat vet from World War two you don't have to go and he's like cool I'm out.

453
01:04:39.56 --> 01:04:47.56
That was Dick Winters I mean who's going to question Dick Winters courage but he was like yeah I'm going back to my farm in Pennsylvania have good luck gentlemen and that was that.

454
01:04:47.56 --> 01:05:01.56
All right gotta go to the book here we gotta get gotta get mom back in the picture here every time I visited my real home it was a fight over the Marine Corps when I was selected for the infantry my mom lost it.

455
01:05:02.56 --> 01:05:06.56
I remember her yelling the hell you are that's not fucking happening you'll be used as cannon fodder.

456
01:05:06.56 --> 01:05:19.56
She mentioned something about shooting me in the kneecaps she swore this was just some macho shit because she was a cop she said it wasn't just me I was dragging down this road I was forcing her to travel it to.

457
01:05:20.56 --> 01:05:27.56
But a young man has to live his own life and I realized that mine was the Marine infantry so mom was not stoked on this whole seat.

458
01:05:27.56 --> 01:05:49.56
It was every time I came home and it was for the first maybe 10 years and it was is like Donald Rumsfeld Dick Cheney George Bush oil I'm like mom where's the detergent like I came home to do my laundry and you're yelling at me about Donald like I don't know anything about all these kind of things.

459
01:05:49.56 --> 01:05:57.56
I want to be a Marine infantry I want to fight and right now I just got to do my laundry so it was it was.

460
01:05:58.56 --> 01:06:07.56
Always it she's always on a 10 always yelling about it and then you know I end up going to pretty dangerous place and then it's like okay you're gonna get out like.

461
01:06:08.56 --> 01:06:15.56
I think I'm staying and then like you know my tour comes up again like okay come back be a fireman do I think I'm gonna stay in.

462
01:06:15.56 --> 01:06:31.56
Awesome stuff wait a listen to your mom from from basic school you get infantry officer school how long is that course three months and you and I were talking earlier about.

463
01:06:31.56 --> 01:06:46.56
When I had James Webb on the podcast yeah and he like gets done with the basic school gets done with the infantry officer course goes to Vietnam they like bring him out in the field point up at a ridge line they go your platoons up there.

464
01:06:47.56 --> 01:06:53.56
Who am I relieving oh it's just a sergeant you're the other platoon commander was wounded or killed or he has a back.

465
01:06:53.56 --> 01:07:06.56
You got it he rolls up there and the first night he's in combat he's just calling for fire I mean just get it just getting after and really leading a complex scenario.

466
01:07:07.56 --> 01:07:19.56
And you know I said how did you feel like you were prepared for that and he was like yes and I can only imagine that you going to now what is it 2007 2008.

467
01:07:19.56 --> 01:07:22.56
I started that course 2009.

468
01:07:23.56 --> 01:07:33.56
Okay so 2009 so we got two wars going on got all these veterans teaching you that must have been about a squared away as a course could be.

469
01:07:33.56 --> 01:07:51.56
And I would answer the same as Secretary Webb I would say yes you know that course is an incredible course and more than anything it prepares you technically and technically to lead Marines on the very first day it definitely helps you become mentally and physically tougher.

470
01:07:51.56 --> 01:08:07.56
There's a lot of mental and physical development that happens there moral development that happens there and the instructors as you alluded to were all Iraq guys and so the quality of the instructor is super selective there and then just the actual curriculum there.

471
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:23.56
I you know two of my buddies our final exercise is in 29 palms and they didn't come back with us to graduate they went to platoons that were in 29 palms and deployed you know a week later and so this you know this web part is still happening and.

472
01:08:24.56 --> 01:08:26.56
And you know when I showed up to my platoon.

473
01:08:26.56 --> 01:08:39.56
I know that I have a lot to learn about leadership I know that I need to listen to my squalors I know all these things I also know that I could leave this platoon today and that is a great testament to the infantry officers course.

474
01:08:40.56 --> 01:08:45.56
Is there one on the east coast or one on the west coast or they all just in Quantico just in Quantico.

475
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:48.56
You just fly out for the final exercise out to 29 palms.

476
01:08:49.56 --> 01:08:50.56
Okay go out there and get some.

477
01:08:50.56 --> 01:09:05.56
This is also where in the book you start talking about you start really forming your your bonds brotherhood now you got a bunch of bunch of names bunch of guys you list off Ty Anthony Alex Pearson Vince young Cameron West.

478
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:09.56
You got some prior enlisted guys Johnny Epps.

479
01:09:10.56 --> 01:09:13.56
I'm saying that right and hey to all the Marines who are butchering your names.

480
01:09:14.56 --> 01:09:15.56
I'm sorry Joe Patterson.

481
01:09:16.56 --> 01:09:17.56
Robert Kelly.

482
01:09:17.56 --> 01:09:20.56
So this is Rob Kelly this is the son of General John Kelly.

483
01:09:22.56 --> 01:09:26.56
John Kelly enlisted in 1970 eventually became a four star general.

484
01:09:27.56 --> 01:09:36.56
If you recognize his name it's probably from when he and you're not in the military it's from when he when he was the White House chief of staff.

485
01:09:38.56 --> 01:09:41.56
Rob was a prior enlisted guy like his dad fought in Fallujah.

486
01:09:41.56 --> 01:09:53.56
These are the guys that you're now forming a bond with and this is kind of like where you really start to become a Marine.

487
01:09:54.56 --> 01:09:55.56
Absolutely.

488
01:09:55.56 --> 01:10:23.56
Yeah it's where everything up to this point was hypothetical like I think this is you know it all started when I was a sophomore I said oh I should go do something about that no idea what that was and then like oh I Navy Marine Marine guys I like those guys they've got something and then like oh no one wants to be infantry I want to be and so all this stuff is just a theory and then I get to IOC and it's like no like these are the people I want to be around this violent and I want to be a part of the

489
01:10:25.56 --> 01:10:54.56
violent aggressive stuff that we do here like it speaks to me in a very and so you know again grew up with the mom even though she's a cop she's still this hippie like there's no like talks about being a warrior is no I and so it was I you know in reflection there's there's something about a warrior calling that was inside my heart and inside my soul that it finally resonated felt validated when I'm running through those woods like a wild animal.

490
01:10:55.56 --> 01:11:08.56
Just attacking and shooting machine guns and rockets all day with this group of savage men and for the first time I said like yes like you've made the right decision and this is these are your people this is your shit and.

491
01:11:08.56 --> 01:11:28.56
And you know it taught me this many lessons but one is that you know it's all it's all hard it's all shitty work it's all tough work but when you're doing it with the right group of men like you just talked about like those are the good times and you wouldn't rather be anywhere else and so.

492
01:11:28.56 --> 01:11:38.56
Yeah I mean that that that list of names that you just read off all those guys went on to combat all those guys went on to do incredible things and then.

493
01:11:39.56 --> 01:11:43.56
You know if we get back to November 9th where we opened with my with my squad leader I mean that that's the day that Robert Kelly was killed and and.

494
01:11:44.56 --> 01:11:48.56
To have Rob Kelly is a mentor and a friend.

495
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:57.56
You know I didn't know his dad was a general until he's coming to speak to us you know that's the kind of guy Rob was that he never would mention that.

496
01:11:58.56 --> 01:12:05.56
And just I hope we maybe I don't know if we're going to come back to him but when we find out about the deployment you know so I'll hold.

497
01:12:06.56 --> 01:12:15.56
Yeah actually as soon as I was reading that section it because you the way you had it broke out broken on the book you like oh we had these guys are all just on with either OCS or ROTC.

498
01:12:15.56 --> 01:12:21.56
And we're all you know went to the basic school and then it was prior enlisted guys and you mentioned Johnny Epps and Joe Patterson and Robert.

499
01:12:22.56 --> 01:12:34.56
I was like Rob Kelly son of a general was prior enlisted I actually went and looked that up because it was amazing right that this guy whose dad is general was like oh cool what are you doing I'm enlisting in Marine Corps like hell yeah.

500
01:12:35.56 --> 01:12:36.56
Hell yeah.

501
01:12:36.56 --> 01:12:47.56
I was going to college I went to college I had to go to college once I got commissioned did a couple deployments and then I had to go to college and I was in college September 11th that happened.

502
01:12:48.56 --> 01:12:56.56
I'm and I'm talking to I went I went to the University of San Diego and I had one of my professors I was an English major one of my professors was a nun and I'm talking to her.

503
01:12:56.56 --> 01:13:08.56
And she says like like don't you know are you going to be able to stay here longer and I was like what do you mean she says well don't don't you want to stay can't you maybe try and get your masters.

504
01:13:09.56 --> 01:13:20.56
I was like what I was what are you talking about sister quite literally I said what do you mean and she just couldn't comprehend and she goes well don't you want to stay here.

505
01:13:20.56 --> 01:13:28.56
And you know be isn't this like in her mind this was the greatest thing ever on this guy that was in the Navy now I'm just gonna have to go to school.

506
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:34.56
And I was like no I want to go back I'd go back tomorrow if they would let me and she says why do you want to go back.

507
01:13:35.56 --> 01:13:36.56
She's like why do you dumbfound it.

508
01:13:37.56 --> 01:13:39.56
Why do you why do you want to go back.

509
01:13:39.56 --> 01:13:57.56
And I in some awkward way because it sounds bad to say I was like well I go back there and I get to be around a bunch of dudes like me that we listen to the same music we like to do the same stuff we're interested in the same thing we laugh at the same jokes we.

510
01:13:57.56 --> 01:14:08.56
We that's where I want to go I want to get back there and you know for you showing up there with all these studs it's like yeah this is this is where I'm supposed to be.

511
01:14:09.56 --> 01:14:16.56
What did you have any challenges there was there anything that you any major lessons learned if you could go back and square yourself away.

512
01:14:16.56 --> 01:14:45.56
I had the benefit of having a couple months between when I graduated TBS and showing up to IOC so you know Joe Patterson would PTS each day and I'd work out with Ty Anthony and so Steve Trizna so we I showed up in pretty good shape thankfully because you it's hard to maintain or improve your fitness at the base of school because it's just 0 6 to 1900 every day and then you're studying in the weekends and so thankfully I had a couple months and so I had to go back to school

513
01:14:46.56 --> 01:15:01.56
and so I I the lesson I learned at IOC is is how to embrace the suck and I would say the only thing that I would say is like it would have been better if I learned it sooner.

514
01:15:01.56 --> 01:15:25.56
But I was I was out we were doing a patrolling exercise at Fort A.P. Hill and I was just GP holding security and been days without food July and Virginia at A.P. Hill and just ticks and and I'm holding the security and just flies landed on my face and

515
01:15:25.56 --> 01:15:42.56
crawling up my sleeves spiders are pelling down gnats in my ears and on my belly is grumbling and I got chafed everywhere and I'm just trying to fight all this and kind of so sad and this and just trying to survive moment to moment and as I continue to kind of fight nature.

516
01:15:42.56 --> 01:15:53.56
I'm on security for that 30 minutes this point and and all the Nats are still there all the answer still coming all and I just find I said like you can't you're not going to defeat nature.

517
01:15:53.56 --> 01:16:12.56
You just got to accept it and in that moment I stopped swatting the flies I didn't care that the answer crawling up my sleeve and it allows you to thrive and when you when you when you when you it's good you know it breaks the suck is the Marine Corps version of good.

518
01:16:12.56 --> 01:16:41.56
It's the Stoics version of a more faht a love your fate it's it's this idea that whatever the circumstances are I accept them and I'm going to find opportunities within this current environment instead of circumstances rather than just try to survive in it and it and it it's it gives you power it gives you agency autonomy you know you no longer just become this this like this leaf that's in a in a brook that's getting tossed around.

519
01:16:42.56 --> 01:16:43.56
Now I have a vote.

520
01:16:44.56 --> 01:17:02.56
It may be a pretty restrained options based on the circumstances but at least I can say how can I best use these challenges and I think of like somebody like Stockdale when when he's when he's in prison.

521
01:17:02.56 --> 01:17:11.56
And they say well was I a victim. No you know you think of Sultans Dean when he's in the gulag are archipelago and he says thank you prison.

522
01:17:12.56 --> 01:17:18.56
When you think of someone like Paul who when he's in prison he's rejoicing.

523
01:17:19.56 --> 01:17:23.56
I think of Sergeant and Tony as he's dying.

524
01:17:24.56 --> 01:17:29.56
He he turns his last words are is everybody okay.

525
01:17:29.56 --> 01:17:52.56
And so it takes all these moments and it allows you to just to take ownership back and and so yeah I think that is I probably learned that two thirds of the way through and I was probably feeling a little victim throughout most of that curriculum and then finally I said you know good.

526
01:17:52.56 --> 01:17:58.56
I'm and now now I'm like crazy because you know when I'm going up the mountains and Bridgeport I just wish it was colder.

527
01:17:59.56 --> 01:18:00.56
I just wish it was some more snow.

528
01:18:00.56 --> 01:18:12.56
I'm so happy that's so hot out here in 20 I promise if it was hotter just be a little bit better and you know but you you got to say that kind of stuff and you got to try to at least believe it otherwise you just powerless.

529
01:18:13.56 --> 01:18:13.56
Yeah.

530
01:18:13.56 --> 01:18:15.56
Otherwise everything really sucks.

531
01:18:15.56 --> 01:18:19.56
It sucks when it sucks but if you can't accept it it's good.

532
01:18:19.56 --> 01:18:27.56
Now this whole book and by the way obviously I'm only reading highlights get the book so that you can get the whole story but it's not just your story.

533
01:18:28.56 --> 01:18:37.56
It's about half of it is written by your interpreter Zach and it's really interesting to hear his perspective because.

534
01:18:37.56 --> 01:18:56.56
We as Americans we have a really hard time picturing what we just picture a stereotype of what we think in Iraq is what we think in Afghan is whatever we just have this stereotype in our head and that's kind of what we blanket over and I know I always have to reiterate what an Iraqi person is.

535
01:18:56.56 --> 01:19:06.56
When I Racky dad is what an Iraqi mom is when Iraqi family is.

536
01:19:07.56 --> 01:19:09.56
Well there are family actually way usually described as say there like you are.

537
01:19:10.56 --> 01:19:13.56
So if you're sitting here listening to me what's an Iraqi family like oh it's a family.

538
01:19:14.56 --> 01:19:15.56
There's a dad.

539
01:19:16.56 --> 01:19:17.56
There's a mom.

540
01:19:17.56 --> 01:19:18.56
They want to look out for their kids.

541
01:19:18.56 --> 01:19:19.56
They're trying to grow their business.

542
01:19:20.56 --> 01:19:21.56
They're trying to get by their time.

543
01:19:21.56 --> 01:19:23.96
They want to look out for their kids.

544
01:19:23.96 --> 01:19:25.36
They're trying to grow their business.

545
01:19:25.36 --> 01:19:26.40
They're trying to get by.

546
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:28.36
They're trying to fix their car.

547
01:19:28.36 --> 01:19:30.40
They got payments due, right?

548
01:19:30.40 --> 01:19:32.28
That's what they're doing.

549
01:19:32.28 --> 01:19:37.28
And it's really interesting to hear Zach's story

550
01:19:37.32 --> 01:19:38.40
in his perspective.

551
01:19:38.40 --> 01:19:39.96
He's one of nine children.

552
01:19:39.96 --> 01:19:41.32
He's from Kunar.

553
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:42.52
He's a Pashtun.

554
01:19:42.52 --> 01:19:46.04
He talks about the Pashtun Wally,

555
01:19:46.04 --> 01:19:48.52
which is their culture,

556
01:19:48.52 --> 01:19:50.60
which some people have heard a little bit about.

557
01:19:50.60 --> 01:19:55.60
He goes into some details, hospitality for visitors, right?

558
01:19:56.40 --> 01:19:57.76
Showing courage.

559
01:19:57.76 --> 01:19:58.68
That's just the way they roll.

560
01:19:58.68 --> 01:20:00.20
You have to show courage in daily life

561
01:20:00.20 --> 01:20:01.32
and you have to show courage

562
01:20:01.32 --> 01:20:03.16
and bravery defending their communities.

563
01:20:03.16 --> 01:20:04.12
You gotta show loyalty.

564
01:20:04.12 --> 01:20:05.12
You gotta show kindness.

565
01:20:05.12 --> 01:20:06.50
You gotta show respect.

566
01:20:08.28 --> 01:20:12.02
Then there's also, they have a code for revenge.

567
01:20:13.08 --> 01:20:14.52
They don't tolerate insults.

568
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:16.24
They're expected to take revenge

569
01:20:16.24 --> 01:20:18.44
if something goes against them

570
01:20:18.44 --> 01:20:22.60
or at least negotiate some kind of compensation

571
01:20:22.60 --> 01:20:25.64
if something happens to their family

572
01:20:25.64 --> 01:20:26.80
or to their community.

573
01:20:28.04 --> 01:20:33.04
Zach's mother's father worked for President Najibullah

574
01:20:35.68 --> 01:20:38.16
who they called Dr. Najib,

575
01:20:38.16 --> 01:20:40.16
who was the president in Afghanistan

576
01:20:40.16 --> 01:20:42.52
after the Soviet Union was driven out.

577
01:20:42.52 --> 01:20:44.92
So in 1989, the Soviet Union leaves

578
01:20:44.92 --> 01:20:49.92
and this guy, Dr. Najib, takes over as a president.

579
01:20:50.16 --> 01:20:52.94
And that's where Zach's mother's father worked.

580
01:20:52.94 --> 01:20:55.12
Zach's father was a soldier

581
01:20:55.12 --> 01:20:58.20
who worked for the government in Kunar.

582
01:20:58.20 --> 01:20:59.28
After he got out of the army,

583
01:20:59.28 --> 01:21:01.16
he worked as a clerk for the Red Cross,

584
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:02.56
worked for the Red Crescent.

585
01:21:04.44 --> 01:21:08.40
The Dr. Najib's government collapsed in 1992.

586
01:21:08.40 --> 01:21:15.40
By 1996, the Taliban is expanding out of Kandahar province.

587
01:21:15.84 --> 01:21:18.68
They eventually capture and execute Dr. Najib.

588
01:21:18.68 --> 01:21:20.04
They take him and his brother

589
01:21:20.04 --> 01:21:21.08
and hang them from light poles

590
01:21:21.08 --> 01:21:23.80
in front of the presidential palace.

591
01:21:23.80 --> 01:21:27.28
That's what's transpiring during,

592
01:21:27.28 --> 01:21:28.60
as Zach is growing up,

593
01:21:28.60 --> 01:21:30.36
this is what Zach's growing up in.

594
01:21:30.36 --> 01:21:31.88
And I'm gonna go to the book here.

595
01:21:31.88 --> 01:21:35.64
And again, this is a section that's from Zach's writing.

596
01:21:35.64 --> 01:21:38.68
And he says this,

597
01:21:38.68 --> 01:21:41.80
I was only five years old when they came from Kandahar

598
01:21:41.80 --> 01:21:44.44
with their long beards and black makeup

599
01:21:44.44 --> 01:21:47.40
surrounding their eyes to take control of Kunar.

600
01:21:47.40 --> 01:21:49.52
But I knew that my parents were scared.

601
01:21:50.64 --> 01:21:53.60
I remember life was very hard when they were in power.

602
01:21:53.60 --> 01:21:57.24
In Kunar, we Pashtuns were already very conservative,

603
01:21:57.24 --> 01:22:00.44
but the Taliban declared controls

604
01:22:00.44 --> 01:22:02.08
over everything in our lives.

605
01:22:02.08 --> 01:22:04.12
Each night, I heard father tell my mother

606
01:22:04.12 --> 01:22:06.88
about the new rules imposed by the Taliban.

607
01:22:06.88 --> 01:22:09.20
Every day, there were new prohibitions.

608
01:22:09.20 --> 01:22:12.44
They have declared television and music un-Islamic.

609
01:22:12.44 --> 01:22:14.52
Then they closed the newspaper.

610
01:22:14.52 --> 01:22:18.20
Then women may no longer work or go to school.

611
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:20.20
Father began to grow his beard.

612
01:22:20.20 --> 01:22:22.72
Mother, my mother had to wear a burqa

613
01:22:22.72 --> 01:22:25.68
covering her entire body outside of our home.

614
01:22:25.68 --> 01:22:27.96
Even her eyes were hidden behind a screen.

615
01:22:27.96 --> 01:22:29.80
She was prohibited from looking at strangers

616
01:22:29.80 --> 01:22:31.24
and could not go out of the house

617
01:22:31.24 --> 01:22:33.44
without my father or one of her sons.

618
01:22:33.44 --> 01:22:36.52
It was strange to me that I had to escort my mother.

619
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:40.52
Except for the madrasa, there were no schools,

620
01:22:40.52 --> 01:22:43.84
no university, electricity was scarce,

621
01:22:43.84 --> 01:22:47.52
maintenance of roads and buildings stopped.

622
01:22:47.52 --> 01:22:50.40
There was really no access to any of the basic life needs

623
01:22:50.40 --> 01:22:55.40
a government is supposed to provide, except guns.

624
01:22:55.64 --> 01:22:57.36
There were always plenty of guns that the Talibs

625
01:22:57.36 --> 01:23:00.40
carried AK-47s and rocket launchers everywhere they went.

626
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:03.28
There was Sharia law, of course.

627
01:23:03.28 --> 01:23:08.28
That was a form of government the Taliban were interested in.

628
01:23:09.16 --> 01:23:11.88
They cut off the hands of thieves,

629
01:23:11.88 --> 01:23:14.84
to leaps from the department for the enforcement

630
01:23:14.84 --> 01:23:18.88
of right Islamic way and prevention of evils.

631
01:23:18.88 --> 01:23:23.72
The religious police enforced laws about modesty with sticks.

632
01:23:24.76 --> 01:23:26.32
They beat people in public who said

633
01:23:26.32 --> 01:23:29.44
they were not following the laws, especially women.

634
01:23:29.44 --> 01:23:31.28
Many people were killed by beheading

635
01:23:31.28 --> 01:23:34.08
or stoning as punishment for their violations.

636
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:36.32
There was no real court, just the Taliban.

637
01:23:37.44 --> 01:23:40.40
Although they were from a very different part of Afghanistan

638
01:23:40.40 --> 01:23:42.44
and had very different accents,

639
01:23:42.44 --> 01:23:47.12
the Taliban and Pashtun like the people in my village,

640
01:23:47.12 --> 01:23:50.32
so some of our neighbors were for the Taliban.

641
01:23:51.52 --> 01:23:53.80
My father was not and he suffered for that.

642
01:23:54.68 --> 01:23:56.88
Power shifts suddenly in Afghanistan.

643
01:23:56.88 --> 01:23:59.68
Who you know and support matters more than who you are.

644
01:24:00.52 --> 01:24:01.88
It has always been that way.

645
01:24:02.92 --> 01:24:04.92
My father lost his job because he'd worked

646
01:24:04.92 --> 01:24:06.52
under Dr. Najib.

647
01:24:06.52 --> 01:24:08.24
He grew his beard even longer

648
01:24:08.24 --> 01:24:11.48
so that he would not attract Taliban attention.

649
01:24:11.48 --> 01:24:14.16
Without his clerk job, he became a farmer

650
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:16.96
and our family, any child old enough to walk was a farmer.

651
01:24:16.96 --> 01:24:18.88
We grew enough vegetables to feed ourselves

652
01:24:18.88 --> 01:24:21.60
with a leftover to sell in the village market.

653
01:24:21.60 --> 01:24:24.44
We grew and sold flowers too, red roses.

654
01:24:24.44 --> 01:24:27.20
Afghans love flowers and plant them everywhere.

655
01:24:27.20 --> 01:24:30.40
Maybe they represent hope that something good

656
01:24:30.40 --> 01:24:31.76
can grow from dust.

657
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:36.80
I was only 11 years old on September 11th, 2001.

658
01:24:36.80 --> 01:24:39.84
I did not really understand what happened that day.

659
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:43.64
We really had no concept of America or the West.

660
01:24:43.64 --> 01:24:47.000
We were told that the people there were infidels

661
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.80
and that they would try to make us stop practicing

662
01:24:49.80 --> 01:24:53.000
Islam or living in an Islamic way.

663
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.28
I certainly did not understand their governments or laws

664
01:24:56.28 --> 01:24:57.90
or the things to come soon.

665
01:24:58.84 --> 01:25:00.60
After the Americans began their invasion,

666
01:25:00.60 --> 01:25:02.92
I still farmed and played cricket in the forest,

667
01:25:02.92 --> 01:25:04.40
but our village was growing

668
01:25:04.40 --> 01:25:06.36
more and more frightened every day.

669
01:25:07.48 --> 01:25:09.12
People were scared that the Americans

670
01:25:09.12 --> 01:25:10.40
would kill us with their planes,

671
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:13.44
especially those who worked for the Taliban or Al-Qaeda.

672
01:25:14.92 --> 01:25:17.60
My father had the radio up to his ear all the time.

673
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:21.72
The day the American bombs started falling

674
01:25:21.72 --> 01:25:25.24
across Afghanistan, the President of the United States said,

675
01:25:25.24 --> 01:25:27.16
the oppressed people of Afghanistan

676
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:31.44
will know the generosity of America and our allies.

677
01:25:31.44 --> 01:25:33.28
As we strike military targets,

678
01:25:33.28 --> 01:25:36.20
we will also drop food, medicine, and supplies

679
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:38.12
to the starving and suffering men and women

680
01:25:38.12 --> 01:25:39.64
and children of Afghanistan.

681
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:44.40
The world had finally remembered we existed.

682
01:25:44.40 --> 01:25:47.000
The Americans came with more guns and more trucks

683
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.04
and more planes.

684
01:25:48.04 --> 01:25:51.000
We hoped they would bring good things too.

685
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.40
Afghanistan had nothing.

686
01:25:53.36 --> 01:25:55.76
After two decades of war, there was no government.

687
01:25:55.76 --> 01:25:59.08
We had no schools, no police, no military.

688
01:25:59.08 --> 01:26:03.28
Literacy was 18.6% in 1979.

689
01:26:03.28 --> 01:26:06.94
In 2001, no one knew because no one had asked.

690
01:26:08.28 --> 01:26:12.02
There was nothing to make us a nation except our hopes.

691
01:26:12.02 --> 01:26:17.02
So, I think it's really lucky that Zach kind of got to see,

692
01:26:27.38 --> 01:26:30.26
you know, he understood freedom, he understood education,

693
01:26:30.26 --> 01:26:31.66
and maybe that's not the best section to read,

694
01:26:31.66 --> 01:26:33.50
but he definitely understood freedom.

695
01:26:33.50 --> 01:26:35.82
He understood education.

696
01:26:35.82 --> 01:26:38.62
He saw the oppressiveness of the Taliban.

697
01:26:38.62 --> 01:26:42.42
If he wouldn't have seen that, he might have not had

698
01:26:42.42 --> 01:26:46.82
this place in his heart where he wanted to really help

699
01:26:46.82 --> 01:26:48.44
out America.

700
01:26:48.44 --> 01:26:53.44
And again, almost half the book is his words.

701
01:26:54.38 --> 01:26:57.50
So, get the book, we'll read some more, but get the book.

702
01:26:57.50 --> 01:27:00.06
You want to get the real details of what it was like

703
01:27:00.06 --> 01:27:02.18
on the ground for these people.

704
01:27:02.18 --> 01:27:03.78
That's a great place to get it.

705
01:27:03.78 --> 01:27:08.78
But September 11th happens, America enters Afghanistan.

706
01:27:11.80 --> 01:27:14.88
And for him, that's an opportunity he talks about.

707
01:27:14.88 --> 01:27:16.56
That's an opportunity for freedom again.

708
01:27:16.56 --> 01:27:20.60
Like he sees that and eventually he does end up

709
01:27:20.60 --> 01:27:24.56
getting a job as an interpreter and we'll get there to that.

710
01:27:24.56 --> 01:27:29.56
But going back to you, you get done with IOC

711
01:27:29.56 --> 01:27:34.000
and you get assigned third battalion, fifth Marines,

712
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
three, five Marines.

713
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.52
And anyone that listens to this podcast knows about

714
01:27:37.52 --> 01:27:41.76
three, five Marines from, well, from with the old breed

715
01:27:41.76 --> 01:27:43.000
by Eugene Sledge.

716
01:27:46.12 --> 01:27:47.48
Three, five fought in World War I.

717
01:27:47.48 --> 01:27:48.60
They fought in Nicaragua.

718
01:27:48.60 --> 01:27:50.56
They fought in World War II in Guadalcanal,

719
01:27:50.56 --> 01:27:53.12
New Britain, Pellew, Okinawa.

720
01:27:53.12 --> 01:27:58.12
In Korea, they were at Incheon.

721
01:27:58.12 --> 01:27:59.80
They were at the breakout and withdrawal

722
01:27:59.80 --> 01:28:02.64
from the chosen reservoir in Vietnam.

723
01:28:02.64 --> 01:28:04.16
They were in Huy City.

724
01:28:05.50 --> 01:28:08.20
They were in the case on Valley, the Death Valley.

725
01:28:08.20 --> 01:28:09.88
They were in Desert Shield, Desert Storm,

726
01:28:09.88 --> 01:28:11.44
and of course Iraq and Afghanistan.

727
01:28:11.44 --> 01:28:15.42
So you get orders to three, five, hallowed unit.

728
01:28:17.92 --> 01:28:20.04
You get there and you get assigned

729
01:28:21.76 --> 01:28:22.76
a little quote from the book,

730
01:28:22.76 --> 01:28:26.74
Second Lieutenant Schumann, first platoon, Kelo Company.

731
01:28:26.74 --> 01:28:28.04
That's what you get told.

732
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:31.96
How does that make you feel?

733
01:28:31.96 --> 01:28:32.80
Yeah, excited.

734
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:36.28
I had been reading with the old breed

735
01:28:37.28 --> 01:28:41.52
and with E.B. Sledge there and that's Kelo three, five.

736
01:28:41.52 --> 01:28:46.52
And just one thing that we as Marines do

737
01:28:46.56 --> 01:28:49.000
would do a very good job of preserving our history,

738
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.32
our heritage, our legacy.

739
01:28:50.32 --> 01:28:52.76
It's drilled into you everywhere you go.

740
01:28:52.76 --> 01:28:55.72
And then, so it's a lie.

741
01:28:55.72 --> 01:28:58.24
It's a lie from the stories that your sergeant

742
01:28:58.24 --> 01:29:00.000
and sergeant tell you at boot camp

743
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.44
and officer can at school.

744
01:29:02.52 --> 01:29:07.52
But you walk outside of the Kelo office and the CP for three,

745
01:29:10.44 --> 01:29:14.72
five, there's a picture of Kelo on Pellilu

746
01:29:14.72 --> 01:29:16.84
with a note from E.B. Sledge.

747
01:29:16.84 --> 01:29:21.84
And this is the idea that you have a responsibility

748
01:29:21.84 --> 01:29:26.84
and an opportunity to carry that legacy forward.

749
01:29:27.60 --> 01:29:29.68
I mean, it's all you could ever dream of.

750
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:31.28
It's all you could ever hope for.

751
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:36.48
Second Lieutenant Schumann, first platoon, Kelo Company.

752
01:29:39.76 --> 01:29:42.56
How long have you been in the Marine Corps for at this point?

753
01:29:42.56 --> 01:29:44.36
A year, nine months.

754
01:29:44.36 --> 01:29:46.40
So you're nine months to a year

755
01:29:46.40 --> 01:29:47.88
and this is everything you've been working for

756
01:29:47.88 --> 01:29:51.48
through college and you get this.

757
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:56.12
But that being said, there's also like some,

758
01:29:56.12 --> 01:29:57.72
and it'll be weird for people to hear this,

759
01:29:57.72 --> 01:29:58.76
there's also some bad news.

760
01:29:58.76 --> 01:30:00.28
And the bad news is that you're scheduled to go

761
01:30:00.28 --> 01:30:01.36
on a West Pact deployment,

762
01:30:01.36 --> 01:30:02.80
which means you can be on a ship

763
01:30:02.80 --> 01:30:05.24
going around the Pacific Ocean,

764
01:30:06.42 --> 01:30:07.76
not going into combat.

765
01:30:07.76 --> 01:30:12.76
That was the plan for your battalion.

766
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:14.28
Yeah, all I wanna do is fight.

767
01:30:14.28 --> 01:30:19.28
I mean, you leave IOC and it's just basically

768
01:30:19.34 --> 01:30:20.80
this controlled aggression.

769
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:22.92
And this is maximum violence.

770
01:30:22.92 --> 01:30:27.92
And all your instructors, I've just left Iraq

771
01:30:28.44 --> 01:30:32.04
and it's what you've been seeing for the last several years

772
01:30:32.04 --> 01:30:34.60
and you're ready to do that.

773
01:30:34.60 --> 01:30:37.72
You know, Alan Iverson, he says,

774
01:30:37.72 --> 01:30:39.36
we're talking about practice, we're talking about practice.

775
01:30:39.36 --> 01:30:41.04
You wanna get, it's time for the game.

776
01:30:41.04 --> 01:30:45.32
And you wanna go get validated.

777
01:30:45.32 --> 01:30:49.12
And so when you find out, hey, you're gonna go to Okinawa

778
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:52.24
and float around a little bit, you think, well, shit.

779
01:30:53.28 --> 01:30:57.56
That's not what I was trying to do here.

780
01:30:57.56 --> 01:31:01.56
So yeah, definitely initially disappointed.

781
01:31:01.56 --> 01:31:05.28
I got, I was, I guess that disappointment

782
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:09.76
to an extent persisted, but once I started working

783
01:31:09.76 --> 01:31:12.24
in lead and Marines, I mean, every day I'm living

784
01:31:12.24 --> 01:31:14.64
in San Clemente, driving down El Camino Real

785
01:31:14.64 --> 01:31:17.60
past Trestles Beach into the North Side

786
01:31:17.60 --> 01:31:19.52
at Camp Pendleton to go shoot machine guns

787
01:31:19.52 --> 01:31:22.84
with 35 savages, like it's a pretty good deal.

788
01:31:22.84 --> 01:31:25.16
And so I pretty quickly, like my little sadness

789
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:27.40
was mostly taken care of, but yeah,

790
01:31:27.40 --> 01:31:29.20
still a little disappointed for sure.

791
01:31:29.20 --> 01:31:31.52
Any challenges when you were doing your workup,

792
01:31:31.52 --> 01:31:33.04
preparing for deployment?

793
01:31:33.04 --> 01:31:38.04
Undoubtedly the start, these, so three, five last went

794
01:31:39.12 --> 01:31:40.60
to Iraq and 08.

795
01:31:41.52 --> 01:31:46.52
And so the senior Lance Corporals all had done

796
01:31:46.52 --> 01:31:50.28
the Iraq deployment and some of the Sargeants.

797
01:31:50.28 --> 01:31:52.76
And then the platoon that I picked up had just gotten

798
01:31:52.76 --> 01:31:53.88
back from Okinawa.

799
01:31:53.88 --> 01:31:56.96
They were the first time that three, five hadn't been

800
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:59.44
in combat in 10 years.

801
01:31:59.44 --> 01:32:01.24
And so they are all feeling,

802
01:32:01.24 --> 01:32:04.24
that's why infantry Marines joined for one reason.

803
01:32:04.24 --> 01:32:05.64
They joined a fight.

804
01:32:05.64 --> 01:32:08.72
And so they're, you know, all their seniors have been

805
01:32:08.72 --> 01:32:10.84
to Iraq, they've all been to combat.

806
01:32:10.84 --> 01:32:13.60
They had to live with this that they didn't.

807
01:32:13.60 --> 01:32:17.64
Then they, of course, like always their leadership is

808
01:32:17.64 --> 01:32:19.88
saying, well, we could go, we're gonna go,

809
01:32:19.88 --> 01:32:22.04
we're gonna go, and then they don't go.

810
01:32:22.04 --> 01:32:26.32
And they just, you know, and so morale was low,

811
01:32:26.32 --> 01:32:28.72
discipline very low.

812
01:32:30.32 --> 01:32:35.12
There was, I mean, it was very tough.

813
01:32:36.40 --> 01:32:39.84
Leadership is always challenging.

814
01:32:39.84 --> 01:32:44.32
And so like the midshipman kind of, when I would teach

815
01:32:44.32 --> 01:32:45.88
a naval academy, would kind of like, you know,

816
01:32:45.88 --> 01:32:49.24
bitching complain about different aspects of leadership

817
01:32:49.24 --> 01:32:50.08
or timing.

818
01:32:50.08 --> 01:32:52.88
And I can't think of a time as a second lieutenant

819
01:32:52.88 --> 01:32:55.80
in the over 245 years in Marine Corps where it would be,

820
01:32:55.80 --> 01:32:58.28
oh, this must have been an easy time to be a second

821
01:32:58.28 --> 01:32:59.12
lieutenant.

822
01:32:59.12 --> 01:33:00.80
It's always a tough time to be.

823
01:33:00.80 --> 01:33:04.28
It's in Huy City, in Quezon, I bet it was pretty hard

824
01:33:04.28 --> 01:33:05.84
to be a second lieutenant, you know?

825
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:08.12
Immediately following Vietnam in the 1970,

826
01:33:08.12 --> 01:33:09.16
probably pretty hard to be a second lieutenant.

827
01:33:09.16 --> 01:33:11.60
And so there's no time where it's easy.

828
01:33:11.60 --> 01:33:14.48
And it's just, those challenges are different based

829
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:16.94
on peacetime, garrison, wartime.

830
01:33:18.56 --> 01:33:21.48
But those Marines were disgruntled, low morale,

831
01:33:21.48 --> 01:33:22.56
and not disciplined.

832
01:33:22.56 --> 01:33:25.56
And that's what I was stepping into initially

833
01:33:25.56 --> 01:33:27.26
as a platoon commander.

834
01:33:27.26 --> 01:33:31.20
Now, when we found out we got overheaded,

835
01:33:31.20 --> 01:33:34.08
you better shape up or you're gonna put on the bench.

836
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:37.000
But you did much of your workout thinking you were

837
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.08
going on Westpac, right?

838
01:33:38.08 --> 01:33:39.68
About six months.

839
01:33:39.68 --> 01:33:42.72
And yeah, this is when the guys were like,

840
01:33:42.72 --> 01:33:44.08
well, we gotta do this again.

841
01:33:44.08 --> 01:33:48.36
We're just gonna go sit on a boat, not cool.

842
01:33:49.96 --> 01:33:53.72
But as you mentioned, things changed.

843
01:33:53.72 --> 01:33:55.96
So you guys get together, it's around Christmas time.

844
01:33:55.96 --> 01:33:58.20
You get together, you gather for your Christmas leave,

845
01:33:58.20 --> 01:34:01.32
a safety brief where they're gonna tell you not to be idiots.

846
01:34:03.44 --> 01:34:05.20
Battalion commander has some work to put out.

847
01:34:05.20 --> 01:34:06.16
Here's what he says.

848
01:34:07.20 --> 01:34:08.04
Here's what he's saying in the book.

849
01:34:08.04 --> 01:34:09.72
As we gathered for a safety brief,

850
01:34:09.72 --> 01:34:11.64
prior to releasing Marines for Christmas leave,

851
01:34:11.64 --> 01:34:13.68
Lieutenant Colonel Morris stood in a circle

852
01:34:13.68 --> 01:34:16.56
of more than 1,000 Marines, all impatient

853
01:34:16.56 --> 01:34:18.12
for the freedom of the leave period

854
01:34:18.12 --> 01:34:21.04
and prepared for the usual tired exhortations

855
01:34:21.04 --> 01:34:24.22
about tire pressure and not drinking and driving.

856
01:34:24.22 --> 01:34:26.48
Those came in as expected.

857
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:28.24
But when Morris announced we would no longer

858
01:34:28.24 --> 01:34:32.48
be deploying to Japan, the air became suddenly charged,

859
01:34:32.48 --> 01:34:35.60
like the ozone smell before a lightning storm.

860
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:40.40
1,000 Marines collectively leaned in to hear his next words.

861
01:34:40.40 --> 01:34:42.52
When he announced that Dark Horse, which is 3-5,

862
01:34:42.52 --> 01:34:45.60
when he announced that Dark Horse was instead deploying

863
01:34:45.60 --> 01:34:49.72
to the Sangen district of Helmand province, Afghanistan,

864
01:34:49.72 --> 01:34:54.44
there was a roar so loud I felt it as much as I heard it.

865
01:34:55.40 --> 01:34:58.56
I could not have wanted anything more for Christmas.

866
01:34:58.56 --> 01:35:00.52
I felt a surge of heat through my body,

867
01:35:00.52 --> 01:35:02.16
a charge of adrenaline and excitement,

868
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:06.80
and deep down a tiny cold pit of fear.

869
01:35:06.80 --> 01:35:08.08
I looked over at Rob Kelly,

870
01:35:08.08 --> 01:35:11.40
expecting to see the same excitement on his face.

871
01:35:12.28 --> 01:35:14.28
And I did not find it.

872
01:35:14.28 --> 01:35:16.92
I gave him a, come on, man, look.

873
01:35:17.88 --> 01:35:20.64
He looked back at me with half a smile and said,

874
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:24.68
I was ready for a Mew, meaning the Japan deployment.

875
01:35:24.68 --> 01:35:27.60
Mine was the fire of the unblooded.

876
01:35:27.60 --> 01:35:32.36
Rob knew Sangen meant we would bury Marines.

877
01:35:40.36 --> 01:35:44.000
Yeah, that's what's happening.

878
01:35:45.92 --> 01:35:48.96
It's hard to explain to civilians

879
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:53.08
that the young men that signed up to go to war

880
01:35:53.08 --> 01:35:54.84
really want to go to war.

881
01:35:54.84 --> 01:35:59.84
And it's hard to convince young men

882
01:36:00.64 --> 01:36:02.44
that are really excited to go to war

883
01:36:03.96 --> 01:36:05.64
to be careful what you wish for.

884
01:36:09.64 --> 01:36:12.92
At this point, we haven't really talked about this yet,

885
01:36:12.92 --> 01:36:17.000
but you have long time girlfriend at this point.

886
01:36:18.20 --> 01:36:20.08
Andrea, is that right, Andrea?

887
01:36:20.08 --> 01:36:21.20
Andrea. Andrea.

888
01:36:21.20 --> 01:36:23.52
So you got Andrea, how long have you been together

889
01:36:23.52 --> 01:36:24.96
with her at this point?

890
01:36:26.24 --> 01:36:27.32
Close to 10 years.

891
01:36:29.16 --> 01:36:30.48
And so you met in high school?

892
01:36:30.48 --> 01:36:32.000
Yep.

893
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.84
And so this is a long, I mean,

894
01:36:34.84 --> 01:36:36.92
you don't get much more long term in relationship

895
01:36:36.92 --> 01:36:40.000
as a 20, whatever old year guy you are at the time

896
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.76
than 10 years, that's a long time.

897
01:36:42.76 --> 01:36:46.80
And you weren't a perfect boyfriend.

898
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:47.76
No.

899
01:36:47.76 --> 01:36:50.16
But you'd still been together for a long time.

900
01:36:50.16 --> 01:36:54.24
And you decide that you're gonna break up with her

901
01:36:54.24 --> 01:36:55.36
just before deployment?

902
01:36:56.96 --> 01:36:58.92
Yeah, I couldn't get my shit together.

903
01:36:58.92 --> 01:37:01.32
I knew what was the right thing to do.

904
01:37:01.32 --> 01:37:02.72
She's my high school sweetheart.

905
01:37:02.72 --> 01:37:04.32
You know, we met at youth group.

906
01:37:05.88 --> 01:37:10.04
She'd always been good and loyal and devoted.

907
01:37:10.88 --> 01:37:15.04
And she's beautiful and she's everything

908
01:37:15.04 --> 01:37:16.84
I could ever hope or dream of.

909
01:37:16.84 --> 01:37:20.68
And the right thing to do for a girl

910
01:37:20.68 --> 01:37:22.76
that's been dealing with your crap

911
01:37:22.76 --> 01:37:24.64
for 10 years at that point is-

912
01:37:24.64 --> 01:37:26.08
A decade, by the way.

913
01:37:26.08 --> 01:37:28.36
Is to make an honest woman of her.

914
01:37:28.36 --> 01:37:31.68
And so we go ring shopping.

915
01:37:34.68 --> 01:37:36.000
This is all pre-deployment leave.

916
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.48
We go ring shopping, we're talking about it.

917
01:37:38.48 --> 01:37:42.88
And I don't have the courage to do the right thing.

918
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:47.32
And so we pull up to LAX and we're about to deploy

919
01:37:47.32 --> 01:37:49.36
the next day and she's about to fly back to Chicago.

920
01:37:49.36 --> 01:37:52.96
And she thinks I'm about to ask her to marry me.

921
01:37:52.96 --> 01:37:56.80
And instead I say, you should find a new boyfriend

922
01:37:56.80 --> 01:37:57.76
while I'm gone.

923
01:37:57.76 --> 01:38:02.76
And she just, she had a fountain drink in the cup holder.

924
01:38:05.32 --> 01:38:07.20
Gave me a little fountain drink bath

925
01:38:07.20 --> 01:38:12.20
and told me that I was real shit and that was it.

926
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:18.96
And yeah, terrible, terrible thing I did there.

927
01:38:28.84 --> 01:38:30.40
All right, you get done with that.

928
01:38:30.40 --> 01:38:35.40
You spend the last day back in California.

929
01:38:35.40 --> 01:38:39.20
You go with Cam, who's one of your buddies.

930
01:38:39.20 --> 01:38:42.32
And you go with Rob, you go to General Kelly's house.

931
01:38:42.32 --> 01:38:44.000
And you have a barbecue.

932
01:38:45.96 --> 01:38:50.24
It's like pretty poetic scenario for you guys

933
01:38:50.24 --> 01:38:51.40
to be rolling out.

934
01:38:51.40 --> 01:38:53.60
It's gotta be kind of crazy going to General Kelly's house

935
01:38:53.60 --> 01:38:56.24
for like the going away, right?

936
01:38:56.24 --> 01:38:57.88
So there's the cabins on Palatin

937
01:38:57.88 --> 01:39:00.64
and we went down to the Del Mar beach

938
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:01.88
and those cabins there.

939
01:39:01.88 --> 01:39:05.72
And Cam and I, after the little fiasco with Andrea,

940
01:39:05.72 --> 01:39:07.84
I just got hammer drunk.

941
01:39:07.84 --> 01:39:10.000
And like the next morning,

942
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
like the day we're gonna get on the buses that night,

943
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.20
but Rob says, hey, you know, stop by, have some lunch.

944
01:39:16.20 --> 01:39:20.64
And like, it's got the shake still from,

945
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:23.24
and General Kelly, you know, they like to drink PBR

946
01:39:23.24 --> 01:39:25.16
and like have a beer, Tom.

947
01:39:25.16 --> 01:39:28.28
Like, well, you say, you say, yes, sir.

948
01:39:28.28 --> 01:39:33.40
And so, yeah, I mean, it's always when you're a second

949
01:39:33.40 --> 01:39:35.44
lieutenant and you're around a four-star general,

950
01:39:35.44 --> 01:39:39.68
it's a little bit weird.

951
01:39:39.68 --> 01:39:43.56
But really, despite the hangover,

952
01:39:43.56 --> 01:39:48.28
what was really captured my attention is just the overall

953
01:39:48.28 --> 01:39:53.84
family dynamic of just a family really centered around service

954
01:39:53.84 --> 01:39:59.32
and duty and then just the love and how so much of that love

955
01:39:59.32 --> 01:40:02.28
was through Rob and emanated from Rob.

956
01:40:02.28 --> 01:40:06.84
And just as a guy who never had that,

957
01:40:06.84 --> 01:40:10.52
it just was always remarkable just to kind of see that.

958
01:40:14.04 --> 01:40:17.56
From there, it's go time.

959
01:40:17.56 --> 01:40:18.88
Going to the book.

960
01:40:18.88 --> 01:40:20.16
From the battalion headquarters

961
01:40:20.16 --> 01:40:23.92
to the forward operating base, Jackson 3-5 was responsible

962
01:40:23.92 --> 01:40:26.64
for almost 37 square miles of Sengen district

963
01:40:26.64 --> 01:40:29.80
and almost 60,000 people living throughout.

964
01:40:29.80 --> 01:40:34.32
I was in Afghanistan a week and at PB Fires for 24 hours

965
01:40:34.32 --> 01:40:38.48
when I received my first mission on October 9th, 2010.

966
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:40.08
I had everything I thought I wanted.

967
01:40:40.08 --> 01:40:42.08
Now it was time to find out the truth.

968
01:40:42.08 --> 01:40:45.40
I left patrol base Fires with a mix of 96 Marines

969
01:40:45.40 --> 01:40:50.08
and Afghan National Army soldiers to look out three areas

970
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:53.000
the 3-5 headquarters wanted to know more about.

971
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.68
In addition to first platoon, I had a host of attachments,

972
01:40:55.68 --> 01:40:59.16
four Marines from 3-7 to give us their insight into the area

973
01:40:59.16 --> 01:41:01.08
and their experience within it.

974
01:41:01.08 --> 01:41:03.56
An entire squad of engineers and two explosive ordnance

975
01:41:03.56 --> 01:41:06.04
disposal Marines to contend with IEDs,

976
01:41:06.04 --> 01:41:09.76
the primary threat in Sengen, a section of six snipers,

977
01:41:09.76 --> 01:41:14.000
the embedded training team, detailed to work with the ANA,

978
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.56
three interpreters to help us communicate,

979
01:41:16.56 --> 01:41:21.04
a joint terminal attack controller to get us air support

980
01:41:21.04 --> 01:41:23.32
if any of the Taliban who typically operated in groups

981
01:41:23.32 --> 01:41:27.24
of three to four men wanted to challenge a group of 96.

982
01:41:27.24 --> 01:41:31.000
Sengen was primarily dirt and blowing dust,

983
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.28
but irrigation canals stretching out from the banks

984
01:41:33.28 --> 01:41:36.36
of the Hellman River created verdant fields of corn

985
01:41:36.36 --> 01:41:39.000
and the pink and red splashes of opium poppy.

986
01:41:39.96 --> 01:41:43.48
On trails, roads, anywhere we would be forced to pass,

987
01:41:43.48 --> 01:41:47.44
the Taliban hid IEDs by the hundreds.

988
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:51.28
They buried yellow plastic jugs containing pounds

989
01:41:51.28 --> 01:41:53.92
of homemade explosives triggered by pressure plates

990
01:41:53.92 --> 01:41:56.56
that completed a circuit when someone stepped on them.

991
01:41:56.56 --> 01:41:58.60
IEDs were indiscriminate weapons,

992
01:41:58.60 --> 01:42:01.20
killing Marines and Afghan civilians alike.

993
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:04.96
Their density demanded we move single file

994
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:08.92
with about 30 feet between each person to keep an IED

995
01:42:08.92 --> 01:42:12.40
from getting more than two or three of us at once.

996
01:42:12.40 --> 01:42:15.44
Patrol base fires was at the center of it all.

997
01:42:16.32 --> 01:42:19.72
Walking single file is the best way to mitigate an IED threat,

998
01:42:19.72 --> 01:42:22.96
but it's a horrible way to encounter your first ambush.

999
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:24.52
I was at the front of the formation,

1000
01:42:24.52 --> 01:42:27.68
moving among the jade leaves and whispers of wind

1001
01:42:27.68 --> 01:42:31.04
through a cornfield, stalks towering over us all

1002
01:42:31.04 --> 01:42:33.88
and concealing our movement when machine gun rounds

1003
01:42:33.88 --> 01:42:36.80
from a nearby building began ripping through the corn.

1004
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:39.80
I dove behind a brush pile that concealed me from view,

1005
01:42:39.80 --> 01:42:43.40
but would not stop a bullet, much less hundreds of them.

1006
01:42:43.40 --> 01:42:45.96
The size of our group and the dispersed formation

1007
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:48.76
meant our element was in a firefight before the remainder

1008
01:42:48.76 --> 01:42:52.72
of my patrol completely exited from PB fires.

1009
01:42:53.84 --> 01:42:56.28
I was going to die before I got the second half

1010
01:42:56.28 --> 01:42:58.04
of my unit out of the base.

1011
01:42:59.72 --> 01:43:02.32
I looked to my left at one of my Marines,

1012
01:43:02.32 --> 01:43:04.52
Sergeant Joseph Nickirk, Nickirk?

1013
01:43:04.52 --> 01:43:05.36
Nickirk.

1014
01:43:05.36 --> 01:43:06.68
Nickirk.

1015
01:43:06.68 --> 01:43:08.96
And shouted, I'm gonna stand up and put some

1016
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:10.28
propulsive fire through that window.

1017
01:43:10.28 --> 01:43:12.48
You fire grenade through it.

1018
01:43:12.48 --> 01:43:15.08
I stood and fired at the window as quickly as I could

1019
01:43:15.08 --> 01:43:17.48
while still retaining any kind of accuracy.

1020
01:43:17.48 --> 01:43:19.20
Nickirk followed with a grenade

1021
01:43:19.20 --> 01:43:20.68
that silenced the machine gun.

1022
01:43:20.68 --> 01:43:23.000
We both dropped into the back into the corn

1023
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.84
where the three seven lieutenant acting as our tour guide

1024
01:43:25.84 --> 01:43:27.64
turned to me and said sarcastically,

1025
01:43:27.64 --> 01:43:29.84
Lieutenant Shuman, you got your combat action ribbon.

1026
01:43:29.84 --> 01:43:31.000
Now make a decision.

1027
01:43:32.52 --> 01:43:33.36
I was angry.

1028
01:43:33.36 --> 01:43:36.52
He was a fellow lieutenant, not an IOC instructor.

1029
01:43:36.52 --> 01:43:39.56
I was the new guy, so I just stayed quiet and took it.

1030
01:43:39.56 --> 01:43:41.92
But I did think to myself, make a decision.

1031
01:43:41.92 --> 01:43:42.84
I did make a decision.

1032
01:43:42.84 --> 01:43:44.68
My decision was not to die in the impact zone

1033
01:43:44.68 --> 01:43:47.12
of a machine gun and kill the guy shooting at us.

1034
01:43:48.32 --> 01:43:50.72
I thought I wanted combat, but finding myself

1035
01:43:50.72 --> 01:43:53.44
in a complex ambush with half the platoon still

1036
01:43:53.44 --> 01:43:56.28
in the patrol base seemed like a bad way to start.

1037
01:43:56.28 --> 01:43:59.28
Suddenly the combat action ribbon seemed less important.

1038
01:43:59.28 --> 01:44:01.000
Less than an hour later, I knelt at the edge

1039
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.20
of a corn field as the ANA, their American advisors,

1040
01:44:04.20 --> 01:44:06.36
and the three interpreters spoke to a local elder

1041
01:44:06.36 --> 01:44:09.52
to tell him we would need to use his compound for 24 hours.

1042
01:44:09.52 --> 01:44:11.44
Like most in Hellman, it was a mini fortress

1043
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:14.000
made of thick walls, six to 10 feet high

1044
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.24
with a sheet steel gate.

1045
01:44:16.24 --> 01:44:18.68
Goats and children would almost certainly roam within

1046
01:44:18.68 --> 01:44:20.64
while women in Burke have stayed out of sight.

1047
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:24.56
Inside home, it's made of the same mud brick as the walls.

1048
01:44:25.52 --> 01:44:27.64
As I waited for an update from the compound,

1049
01:44:27.64 --> 01:44:31.20
a single shot rang out, followed by Sergeant Decker

1050
01:44:31.20 --> 01:44:33.16
coming at me in a run.

1051
01:44:33.16 --> 01:44:35.28
Sir Teague, is it Teague?

1052
01:44:35.28 --> 01:44:38.36
Sir Teague shot someone, I took a breath.

1053
01:44:38.36 --> 01:44:39.84
Okay, did he have a gun?

1054
01:44:39.84 --> 01:44:40.68
Decker nodded his head.

1055
01:44:40.68 --> 01:44:41.76
Yes sir.

1056
01:44:41.76 --> 01:44:42.60
Is he dead?

1057
01:44:42.60 --> 01:44:43.44
Very.

1058
01:44:43.44 --> 01:44:46.52
All right, well-telt Teague, he did a good job.

1059
01:44:46.52 --> 01:44:49.04
That's when the reality of Sangen hit me.

1060
01:44:49.04 --> 01:44:50.36
We could kill people here.

1061
01:44:51.40 --> 01:44:54.40
It was a notion that would soon become prosaic,

1062
01:44:54.40 --> 01:44:56.98
but in the moment, it was striking.

1063
01:44:56.98 --> 01:45:01.98
So that's the kickoff to deployment right there.

1064
01:45:05.58 --> 01:45:06.62
Right into it.

1065
01:45:06.62 --> 01:45:07.82
Right into it.

1066
01:45:07.82 --> 01:45:11.82
I always say that I got very lucky in my combat experience

1067
01:45:11.82 --> 01:45:16.82
that it was the most gradual, nice escalation over time.

1068
01:45:17.82 --> 01:45:18.66
Sure.

1069
01:45:18.66 --> 01:45:20.56
And that's just pure luck.

1070
01:45:21.82 --> 01:45:24.94
And you did not get that gradual escalation.

1071
01:45:24.94 --> 01:45:27.10
Baptism by fire.

1072
01:45:27.10 --> 01:45:31.22
I had a guy that was one of the Sante Raiders on,

1073
01:45:31.22 --> 01:45:32.38
special forces guy.

1074
01:45:33.26 --> 01:45:35.90
He did one mission in Vietnam.

1075
01:45:35.90 --> 01:45:37.62
He, they flew from America.

1076
01:45:37.62 --> 01:45:39.46
He was a brand new special forces guy.

1077
01:45:40.38 --> 01:45:43.54
He, his first combat operation was the Sante Raide.

1078
01:45:43.54 --> 01:45:46.06
He got off the aircraft and five seconds later

1079
01:45:46.06 --> 01:45:47.06
was killing a dude.

1080
01:45:47.06 --> 01:45:49.50
Like stepped off the aircraft and killed someone

1081
01:45:49.50 --> 01:45:51.06
and 20 minutes later they were gone.

1082
01:45:51.06 --> 01:45:53.26
And that was his whole experience in Vietnam,

1083
01:45:53.26 --> 01:45:55.74
but it was a pretty intense 20 minutes.

1084
01:45:57.22 --> 01:45:59.10
That's the kickoff to this deployment.

1085
01:45:59.10 --> 01:46:02.08
And this deployment is extremely kinetic deployment

1086
01:46:02.08 --> 01:46:03.58
for you guys.

1087
01:46:03.58 --> 01:46:06.58
And, you know, this is the true of all wars.

1088
01:46:06.58 --> 01:46:09.50
I mean, depending on where you are and when you're there,

1089
01:46:09.50 --> 01:46:12.90
it can be anything from a deployment

1090
01:46:12.90 --> 01:46:14.46
where you're sitting around a chow hall,

1091
01:46:14.46 --> 01:46:19.46
eating whatever gourmet food from some contractor,

1092
01:46:19.46 --> 01:46:23.58
or it can be this type of deployment.

1093
01:46:23.58 --> 01:46:25.22
This is a hardcore deployment.

1094
01:46:25.22 --> 01:46:27.98
How much did you know when you were going in,

1095
01:46:28.90 --> 01:46:30.70
how hot was it when you were showing up there?

1096
01:46:30.70 --> 01:46:33.06
You knew what you were getting into?

1097
01:46:33.06 --> 01:46:34.42
Not really.

1098
01:46:34.42 --> 01:46:37.06
We were still very coin centric.

1099
01:46:37.06 --> 01:46:41.42
So, you know, the final exercise that a battalion does

1100
01:46:41.42 --> 01:46:44.86
before they go out to deployment is called EMV

1101
01:46:44.86 --> 01:46:45.98
or a Hans Mojave Viper.

1102
01:46:45.98 --> 01:46:47.18
Now it's got a new name of course.

1103
01:46:47.18 --> 01:46:50.54
But that final exercise that we're doing

1104
01:46:50.54 --> 01:46:53.62
was all about kissing babies.

1105
01:46:53.62 --> 01:46:55.94
There's a big key leader engagement

1106
01:46:55.94 --> 01:46:57.58
where you're sitting with the villager elder

1107
01:46:57.58 --> 01:46:59.22
and shaking hands with him.

1108
01:46:59.22 --> 01:47:02.42
And so it was like Shuras and Kalees.

1109
01:47:03.62 --> 01:47:07.38
When I ran training, we started doing key leader engagements.

1110
01:47:07.38 --> 01:47:08.22
Right?

1111
01:47:08.22 --> 01:47:12.30
And they were gonna go about 100% of the time.

1112
01:47:12.30 --> 01:47:13.90
It was so awesome.

1113
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:16.94
But we had great actors and people would come out

1114
01:47:16.94 --> 01:47:18.90
and the key leader guy and you know,

1115
01:47:18.90 --> 01:47:20.18
oh, it's very nice to meet you.

1116
01:47:20.18 --> 01:47:21.62
And the spider hole would open up

1117
01:47:21.62 --> 01:47:23.38
and I would come people with machine guns.

1118
01:47:23.38 --> 01:47:24.94
But it sounds like maybe you weren't getting that treatment.

1119
01:47:24.94 --> 01:47:26.50
You were getting the treatment like it was gonna go.

1120
01:47:26.50 --> 01:47:27.66
Like, hey, that's what you're there to do.

1121
01:47:27.66 --> 01:47:30.18
So we still did our live fire training.

1122
01:47:30.18 --> 01:47:32.78
But the emphasis was, you know,

1123
01:47:32.78 --> 01:47:36.62
the just try to recreate the Iraq awakening, you know,

1124
01:47:36.62 --> 01:47:38.62
that was the playbook.

1125
01:47:38.62 --> 01:47:42.70
And about a week before we left though,

1126
01:47:42.70 --> 01:47:47.02
the company commander of the AO that we were gonna rip out,

1127
01:47:47.02 --> 01:47:48.86
he's now battalion commander, Ryan Cohen,

1128
01:47:48.86 --> 01:47:52.42
Tana Krohn Cohen came and he'd been medevacked.

1129
01:47:52.42 --> 01:47:54.98
And he's like, shit is real.

1130
01:47:54.98 --> 01:47:57.22
And this was the first guy that kind of say like,

1131
01:47:57.22 --> 01:48:00.38
hey, you're gonna go there and fight.

1132
01:48:00.38 --> 01:48:03.66
Did you guys know where you were going specifically?

1133
01:48:03.66 --> 01:48:08.66
We did, but the Intel briefs were pretty spotty, the ARs.

1134
01:48:10.02 --> 01:48:11.46
There was not a whole lot of.

1135
01:48:11.46 --> 01:48:14.54
Are you communicating with guys directly?

1136
01:48:14.54 --> 01:48:18.98
So I think some guys have zipper maybe talking,

1137
01:48:18.98 --> 01:48:20.42
but you know, second lieutenant,

1138
01:48:20.42 --> 01:48:23.90
no, not getting read in on really much of this stuff.

1139
01:48:23.90 --> 01:48:27.74
And still, I mean, to the point that the book that I'm reading

1140
01:48:27.74 --> 01:48:29.98
on the flight over is three cups of tea.

1141
01:48:30.86 --> 01:48:34.02
And that's an appropriate reaction.

1142
01:48:34.02 --> 01:48:37.38
And then, you know, we're doing the cultural courses

1143
01:48:37.38 --> 01:48:39.94
at Leatherneck, the big base before we fly into,

1144
01:48:39.94 --> 01:48:41.58
out to the Pachol bases.

1145
01:48:41.58 --> 01:48:44.02
And I've got like a little smart pack of like,

1146
01:48:44.02 --> 01:48:46.98
how are you, how do you do nice to meet you, sir?

1147
01:48:46.98 --> 01:48:49.78
And I'm quizzing all my squad leaders.

1148
01:48:49.78 --> 01:48:51.82
I'm like, no, you don't know how to say nice to meet you.

1149
01:48:51.82 --> 01:48:53.02
Like, let's do it again.

1150
01:48:53.02 --> 01:48:56.70
And like, that's still really what I thought

1151
01:48:56.70 --> 01:48:58.74
we were headed into.

1152
01:48:58.74 --> 01:49:02.58
And it very immediately was apparent

1153
01:49:02.58 --> 01:49:04.10
that no one was gonna drink tea

1154
01:49:04.10 --> 01:49:06.54
and everybody was gonna try to kill us.

1155
01:49:06.54 --> 01:49:11.02
We, when in Ramadi, we had guys like our friends

1156
01:49:11.02 --> 01:49:12.78
were coming to relieve us.

1157
01:49:12.78 --> 01:49:16.34
And so we're telling them what's going down

1158
01:49:16.34 --> 01:49:17.30
and what's happening.

1159
01:49:17.30 --> 01:49:20.10
And they're going to,

1160
01:49:21.82 --> 01:49:23.26
like my guys are coming on wounded,

1161
01:49:23.26 --> 01:49:25.46
they're going to my guys' funerals here.

1162
01:49:25.46 --> 01:49:29.90
It was like a, it was a rare occasion for, you know,

1163
01:49:29.90 --> 01:49:34.10
that tight turnover into like really hard combat.

1164
01:49:34.10 --> 01:49:35.66
But, you know, they came over,

1165
01:49:35.66 --> 01:49:37.46
they knew what they were getting into.

1166
01:49:37.46 --> 01:49:40.30
Doesn't, a lot of times it doesn't work like that.

1167
01:49:41.86 --> 01:49:43.14
Three cups of tea.

1168
01:49:44.38 --> 01:49:49.38
I had one of my senior leaders who's a friend of mine.

1169
01:49:49.54 --> 01:49:53.14
And, but, you know, he was really hyped on three cups of tea.

1170
01:49:53.14 --> 01:49:56.38
And we were not, especially coming home from Ramadi,

1171
01:49:56.38 --> 01:49:59.10
we were especially not hyped about three cups of tea.

1172
01:49:59.10 --> 01:50:03.58
And when that book turned out to be a big lie,

1173
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:07.02
boy, did I have fun without one throwing it back in his face.

1174
01:50:10.74 --> 01:50:15.34
Did you, when you, during like those final exercises

1175
01:50:15.34 --> 01:50:18.42
and stuff, what was the attitude with your guys?

1176
01:50:18.42 --> 01:50:20.18
Were they like, okay, well, that's what, you know,

1177
01:50:20.18 --> 01:50:21.78
that's what the boss is saying we're going to be doing.

1178
01:50:21.78 --> 01:50:24.22
We're going to be drinking tea with the locals.

1179
01:50:24.22 --> 01:50:28.06
No one had any Afghanistan experience.

1180
01:50:28.06 --> 01:50:32.10
And, and so, you know, some of those guys had been

1181
01:50:32.10 --> 01:50:35.98
in the flusion, 08 where it was kind of that, you know,

1182
01:50:35.98 --> 01:50:38.58
clearhold bill that was really more towards the bill phase

1183
01:50:38.58 --> 01:50:43.58
there. And so that 08 Iraq experience was kind of reinforced

1184
01:50:43.58 --> 01:50:44.86
some of the stuff that we're doing.

1185
01:50:44.86 --> 01:50:49.42
And so, you know, we're all hoping for a fight,

1186
01:50:49.42 --> 01:50:52.46
but we're Marines and we're going to do whatever we're told

1187
01:50:52.46 --> 01:50:53.66
we got to do and do it well.

1188
01:50:53.66 --> 01:50:57.30
And so if it's kissing babies, you know, and then we'll,

1189
01:50:57.30 --> 01:51:00.82
we'll do that, you know, and that's kind of what we're.

1190
01:51:00.82 --> 01:51:04.58
So what was the, what was the mission that you guys

1191
01:51:04.58 --> 01:51:07.46
were tasked to do like broadly?

1192
01:51:07.46 --> 01:51:12.38
Yeah, secure, provide security for the singing district AO,

1193
01:51:12.38 --> 01:51:16.10
increased security that I mean, increased security.

1194
01:51:16.10 --> 01:51:16.94
That's it.

1195
01:51:16.94 --> 01:51:20.74
And your company commander was, when you write about him

1196
01:51:20.74 --> 01:51:23.12
in the book, he had an aggressive attitude.

1197
01:51:24.58 --> 01:51:25.42
He did.

1198
01:51:25.42 --> 01:51:30.42
But it was hard to know like what his tolerance or willingness

1199
01:51:32.62 --> 01:51:35.90
of risk assessment or, you know, risk tolerance was

1200
01:51:35.90 --> 01:51:38.22
or what he would accept or what he wouldn't.

1201
01:51:38.22 --> 01:51:42.98
But he was, we, Kelo company, Sledgehammer, E.B. Sledge,

1202
01:51:42.98 --> 01:51:46.86
if historically always had the aggressive reputation.

1203
01:51:46.86 --> 01:51:50.50
And we had hardcore sergeants that work up and, and yeah.

1204
01:51:50.50 --> 01:51:54.74
So we maintain this, which it was enabled by our RCOs.

1205
01:51:54.74 --> 01:51:57.14
Is this really aggressive company for sure.

1206
01:51:57.14 --> 01:52:01.74
And then in order to maintain or establish security,

1207
01:52:02.58 --> 01:52:04.02
you're going out on patrols.

1208
01:52:04.02 --> 01:52:04.86
Yeah.

1209
01:52:04.86 --> 01:52:06.46
You're taking A&A with you all the time?

1210
01:52:08.06 --> 01:52:09.22
Trying not to.

1211
01:52:09.22 --> 01:52:12.32
Initially we would often forget them at the,

1212
01:52:12.32 --> 01:52:16.58
at the patrol base, but towards the latter half

1213
01:52:16.58 --> 01:52:18.38
of the deployment, we were bringing them,

1214
01:52:18.38 --> 01:52:20.74
always bringing them out, but we, we,

1215
01:52:20.74 --> 01:52:23.26
that first mission had like such high visibility

1216
01:52:23.26 --> 01:52:26.30
because it was a, we were scaring battalion objectives

1217
01:52:26.30 --> 01:52:28.82
and doing a three day operation that we had to have

1218
01:52:28.82 --> 01:52:30.50
the A&A with us.

1219
01:52:30.50 --> 01:52:33.46
But they and they were happy to not go out

1220
01:52:33.46 --> 01:52:35.10
and we were happy to not take them out.

1221
01:52:35.10 --> 01:52:38.54
And so it wasn't towards the latter half of the deployment

1222
01:52:38.54 --> 01:52:41.54
that we really started kind of employing them consistently.

1223
01:52:42.94 --> 01:52:47.94
But yeah, those, those first patrols were conventional

1224
01:52:48.98 --> 01:52:49.82
fighting.

1225
01:52:49.82 --> 01:52:51.88
I mean, it was the enemy was in a defense in depth

1226
01:52:51.88 --> 01:52:55.26
with obstacles covered by machine guns.

1227
01:52:55.26 --> 01:52:59.74
And we were on the offense and just straight assaulting

1228
01:52:59.74 --> 01:53:00.90
into an enemy defense.

1229
01:53:00.90 --> 01:53:05.90
And that's, and so anything about improving local security

1230
01:53:06.14 --> 01:53:08.58
or doing any kind of counterinsurgency, it was no,

1231
01:53:08.58 --> 01:53:12.10
just go out there and kill as many guys as you can.

1232
01:53:13.02 --> 01:53:15.82
Yeah. Well, that's actually part of counterinsurgency

1233
01:53:15.82 --> 01:53:17.46
is killing a bunch of bad guys.

1234
01:53:17.46 --> 01:53:21.02
And that was, that's a very effective and necessary part

1235
01:53:21.02 --> 01:53:22.54
of it because you can't build schools

1236
01:53:22.54 --> 01:53:24.14
while you're getting blown up.

1237
01:53:24.14 --> 01:53:27.62
And, you know, security for the populace is the way that I,

1238
01:53:28.98 --> 01:53:31.02
for lack of a better word, pitched it up my chain

1239
01:53:31.02 --> 01:53:32.54
of command, what we were doing.

1240
01:53:32.54 --> 01:53:34.34
Hey, we're going to provide security for the populace.

1241
01:53:34.34 --> 01:53:35.42
Well, how are you going to do that?

1242
01:53:35.42 --> 01:53:36.50
We're going to kill all these bad guys

1243
01:53:36.50 --> 01:53:39.10
or at least as many of them as we can.

1244
01:53:39.10 --> 01:53:41.42
What was your op tempo like?

1245
01:53:41.42 --> 01:53:42.82
So how often are you guys going out?

1246
01:53:42.82 --> 01:53:44.50
How long are you staying out for?

1247
01:53:44.50 --> 01:53:48.98
I mean, every day, I mean, we're doing

1248
01:53:48.98 --> 01:53:52.30
a platoon size patrols every day for the first month or two.

1249
01:53:52.30 --> 01:53:57.30
And that's because you needed a platoon size element

1250
01:53:57.58 --> 01:54:00.58
to get in the, to effectively fight the types of fights

1251
01:54:00.58 --> 01:54:01.74
that we were engaged in.

1252
01:54:01.74 --> 01:54:03.62
And then it, then it was a squad.

1253
01:54:03.62 --> 01:54:06.22
And, but it was tough because you had a,

1254
01:54:06.22 --> 01:54:10.10
you had a squad on post, you had a squad on QRF,

1255
01:54:10.10 --> 01:54:12.10
and then you had a squad patrolling.

1256
01:54:12.10 --> 01:54:16.14
And the QRF squad almost always got called out.

1257
01:54:16.14 --> 01:54:19.18
And so that rest squad was really never resting.

1258
01:54:19.18 --> 01:54:21.62
And so you're either on post patrolling

1259
01:54:21.62 --> 01:54:23.66
or responding out as QRF.

1260
01:54:23.66 --> 01:54:27.10
So it was, it was a, that tempo was pretty brutal.

1261
01:54:27.10 --> 01:54:29.50
And so the troops were out every day.

1262
01:54:32.34 --> 01:54:33.58
I don't know if this is the right word,

1263
01:54:33.58 --> 01:54:35.18
but it sounds like it might be the right word.

1264
01:54:35.18 --> 01:54:37.38
You kind of gotten a little bit of trouble

1265
01:54:37.38 --> 01:54:38.62
up the chain of command.

1266
01:54:38.62 --> 01:54:39.46
Yeah.

1267
01:54:40.38 --> 01:54:43.34
You got counseled for your cowboy attitude

1268
01:54:43.34 --> 01:54:44.18
and this kind of thing.

1269
01:54:44.18 --> 01:54:45.02
Break that down a little bit.

1270
01:54:45.02 --> 01:54:46.50
What mistakes did you make?

1271
01:54:46.50 --> 01:54:48.46
What could you have done that better?

1272
01:54:48.46 --> 01:54:49.30
Where were you right?

1273
01:54:49.30 --> 01:54:50.30
Where were you wrong?

1274
01:54:52.78 --> 01:54:56.66
We were out on operation and we'd been out until two or three

1275
01:54:56.66 --> 01:55:00.70
and I, and I called into the main, the CP.

1276
01:55:00.70 --> 01:55:02.58
And I said, hey, we're gonna, we're gonna turn our radio

1277
01:55:02.58 --> 01:55:03.42
off for a couple hours.

1278
01:55:03.42 --> 01:55:05.10
Conserve battery will be up at zero six

1279
01:55:05.10 --> 01:55:07.18
and call them with the radio check.

1280
01:55:07.18 --> 01:55:09.18
And when I turned the radio back on at zero six

1281
01:55:09.18 --> 01:55:10.78
couple hours later, it was like,

1282
01:55:10.78 --> 01:55:13.22
broken arrow, where are you sledgehammer?

1283
01:55:13.22 --> 01:55:14.94
Have you been overrun?

1284
01:55:14.94 --> 01:55:16.38
Sledgehammer one, call in.

1285
01:55:16.38 --> 01:55:21.14
I'm like, hey, we called you guys, got Roger up

1286
01:55:21.14 --> 01:55:23.42
that we were turning the radio off

1287
01:55:23.42 --> 01:55:26.98
and the night watcher said that was good to go.

1288
01:55:27.78 --> 01:55:30.30
So, and it's like, no, you're not in the log book.

1289
01:55:30.30 --> 01:55:35.30
I'm like, so yeah, when we got back,

1290
01:55:35.30 --> 01:55:38.22
you know, my CO was there and he said,

1291
01:55:38.22 --> 01:55:39.90
you know, I'm gonna kick your ass

1292
01:55:39.90 --> 01:55:41.58
and you think you don't have to call in

1293
01:55:41.58 --> 01:55:43.22
and you don't think you don't have to report.

1294
01:55:43.22 --> 01:55:47.02
And one of my squad leaders, we were in a fight

1295
01:55:47.02 --> 01:55:49.94
and they had shot some already or a high mar.

1296
01:55:49.94 --> 01:55:52.78
And the main kept calling for a sit-rep.

1297
01:55:52.78 --> 01:55:53.94
And you know, what's the BDA?

1298
01:55:53.94 --> 01:55:54.78
What's the sit-rep?

1299
01:55:54.78 --> 01:55:56.82
And he said, how about you guys just grab a cup of coffee,

1300
01:55:56.82 --> 01:55:58.18
take a seat, I'm in a fight.

1301
01:55:59.18 --> 01:56:04.02
And you know, we had this company gunny Carlisle.

1302
01:56:04.02 --> 01:56:06.38
He was a savage dude and he's like,

1303
01:56:06.38 --> 01:56:08.18
what'd you say you motherfucker?

1304
01:56:08.18 --> 01:56:10.26
Like they're fighting over the radio.

1305
01:56:10.26 --> 01:56:12.58
So my guys were, yeah, my guys were,

1306
01:56:14.50 --> 01:56:16.58
it's like kind of that common tension

1307
01:56:16.58 --> 01:56:19.94
between higher headquarters and the dudes doing the fighting.

1308
01:56:19.94 --> 01:56:24.62
And so yeah, we got reigned in and we got,

1309
01:56:24.62 --> 01:56:26.62
but you know, it was punishment

1310
01:56:26.62 --> 01:56:29.46
that had to go back to the company position

1311
01:56:29.46 --> 01:56:31.30
from being out at a patrol base,

1312
01:56:31.30 --> 01:56:33.50
just as the platoon by ourselves.

1313
01:56:33.50 --> 01:56:36.66
But it wouldn't, it turned out it was a reward

1314
01:56:36.66 --> 01:56:40.26
because the area around the company

1315
01:56:40.26 --> 01:56:42.78
hadn't been patrolled aggressively.

1316
01:56:42.78 --> 01:56:44.94
And we had been patrolling now for a month, month and a half.

1317
01:56:44.94 --> 01:56:46.58
So we kind of created a little security bubble.

1318
01:56:46.58 --> 01:56:48.58
We were having a harder time getting into fights.

1319
01:56:48.58 --> 01:56:49.66
And so they brought us back.

1320
01:56:49.66 --> 01:56:50.86
And then the first time we go out,

1321
01:56:50.86 --> 01:56:53.50
we killed a ton of dudes and come back with some AK-47s.

1322
01:56:53.50 --> 01:56:55.74
We're like, yeah, such hammer once here now.

1323
01:56:55.74 --> 01:56:57.10
You know, here's his AKs.

1324
01:56:58.10 --> 01:57:02.38
And so yeah, I could have had more tacked for sure.

1325
01:57:03.90 --> 01:57:06.50
Yeah, I was probably light on tacked.

1326
01:57:06.50 --> 01:57:09.94
You know, one thing I used to tell my guys was that,

1327
01:57:09.94 --> 01:57:13.30
like the next echelon is always messed up, right?

1328
01:57:13.30 --> 01:57:15.66
From our perspective, the next echelon up the chain of command

1329
01:57:15.66 --> 01:57:17.46
is always like, they don't understand.

1330
01:57:17.46 --> 01:57:18.30
Well, here's the deal.

1331
01:57:18.30 --> 01:57:19.14
Why don't they understand?

1332
01:57:19.14 --> 01:57:19.98
They don't understand

1333
01:57:19.98 --> 01:57:22.14
because I'm not doing a good job of pushing them information.

1334
01:57:22.14 --> 01:57:24.30
And I'm not seeing what their perspective is

1335
01:57:24.30 --> 01:57:26.18
because they're probably got someone screaming at them,

1336
01:57:26.18 --> 01:57:28.02
going, what do you mean you're dropping already into that?

1337
01:57:28.02 --> 01:57:29.18
Well, you tell us what's going on.

1338
01:57:29.18 --> 01:57:32.26
And they're asking, and that's how these things,

1339
01:57:32.26 --> 01:57:33.58
that's how you get a little disconnect.

1340
01:57:33.58 --> 01:57:36.38
You get a disconnect between the guys that are fighting

1341
01:57:36.38 --> 01:57:38.18
and the guys that are not.

1342
01:57:38.18 --> 01:57:40.58
There can be some animosity there

1343
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:41.50
and it can be a problem.

1344
01:57:41.50 --> 01:57:42.42
If you're not careful,

1345
01:57:42.42 --> 01:57:44.14
especially from a leadership position,

1346
01:57:44.14 --> 01:57:46.82
you know, for you guys that are out there,

1347
01:57:46.82 --> 01:57:49.66
you're gonna be the one that translates things

1348
01:57:49.66 --> 01:57:51.58
up and down the chain of command.

1349
01:57:51.58 --> 01:57:54.82
And that is not an easy job,

1350
01:57:54.82 --> 01:57:56.38
but it's a really important job

1351
01:57:56.38 --> 01:57:58.66
because if we have a real disconnect,

1352
01:57:58.66 --> 01:58:00.70
then we're not getting the support that we need

1353
01:58:00.70 --> 01:58:02.86
and it causes all kinds of problems.

1354
01:58:02.86 --> 01:58:07.78
So don't take anything personally, right?

1355
01:58:07.78 --> 01:58:10.86
When they're asking you what the hell's going on,

1356
01:58:10.86 --> 01:58:12.22
just do your best to try and tell them

1357
01:58:12.22 --> 01:58:13.42
what the hell's going on.

1358
01:58:13.42 --> 01:58:17.46
When they're asking you stupid questions,

1359
01:58:18.46 --> 01:58:19.98
it's because you didn't tell them,

1360
01:58:19.98 --> 01:58:23.10
well, you know, how you were going to do a Kazovac

1361
01:58:23.10 --> 01:58:24.42
in this particular scenario

1362
01:58:24.42 --> 01:58:28.70
or how you were gonna handle this particular type of threat.

1363
01:58:28.70 --> 01:58:29.82
They're asking you this stuff

1364
01:58:29.82 --> 01:58:30.66
because they wanna know,

1365
01:58:30.66 --> 01:58:33.94
because you didn't tell them and just do your best.

1366
01:58:33.94 --> 01:58:35.54
I know it's hard.

1367
01:58:35.54 --> 01:58:37.94
And for senior leaders out there,

1368
01:58:37.94 --> 01:58:39.94
when your folks are in the field,

1369
01:58:39.94 --> 01:58:42.18
they're working on some shit.

1370
01:58:42.18 --> 01:58:44.02
And as soon as they get the chance,

1371
01:58:44.02 --> 01:58:45.58
they're gonna tell you what's up,

1372
01:58:45.58 --> 01:58:49.06
but leave them alone as long as you possibly can,

1373
01:58:49.06 --> 01:58:52.54
leave them alone and let them sort their shit out

1374
01:58:52.54 --> 01:58:53.74
and then they'll get back to you

1375
01:58:53.74 --> 01:58:56.46
and you can get your numbers and get your update

1376
01:58:56.46 --> 01:58:58.74
and get your sit-rep and all that.

1377
01:58:58.74 --> 01:59:00.98
Just try and understand each other's perspectives,

1378
01:59:00.98 --> 01:59:02.66
please, it goes a long way.

1379
01:59:02.66 --> 01:59:06.58
Yeah, I think that was a good summation of lessons learned.

1380
01:59:10.66 --> 01:59:12.62
All this fighting going on,

1381
01:59:13.54 --> 01:59:15.42
there's gonna be a price.

1382
01:59:15.42 --> 01:59:19.38
Cam, your buddy Cam gets severely wounded by an IED.

1383
01:59:20.58 --> 01:59:25.58
Lost his right leg, injured his left leg.

1384
01:59:26.34 --> 01:59:27.78
Or sorry, lost one leg.

1385
01:59:27.78 --> 01:59:29.98
It really injured the other one.

1386
01:59:29.98 --> 01:59:32.02
Bright eyes messed up.

1387
01:59:32.02 --> 01:59:34.34
That seemed, at least when I read it in the book,

1388
01:59:34.34 --> 01:59:37.06
it seemed like that was a little bit

1389
01:59:37.06 --> 01:59:39.34
of a reality check for you

1390
01:59:40.22 --> 01:59:44.22
because we are young and we feel invincible.

1391
01:59:45.54 --> 01:59:48.02
Yeah, Cam was this kind of larger than life.

1392
01:59:48.02 --> 01:59:52.10
John Wayne kind of figured to me a guy, big, strong dude

1393
01:59:52.10 --> 01:59:54.94
that we all looked up to, charismatic.

1394
01:59:54.94 --> 01:59:58.86
And when I came into patrol base that day,

1395
01:59:58.86 --> 02:00:00.94
Will Donnelly, the second platoon commander,

1396
02:00:00.94 --> 02:00:04.30
meets me and says, I don't think Cam's gonna make it.

1397
02:00:04.30 --> 02:00:08.06
And we were taking casualties at such a crazy rate.

1398
02:00:08.06 --> 02:00:11.14
And I'm like, man, if Cam can go down, I mean, like,

1399
02:00:13.10 --> 02:00:15.98
and I hadn't, I was good in a firefight,

1400
02:00:15.98 --> 02:00:19.06
I could still kind of compartmentalize and focus on

1401
02:00:19.06 --> 02:00:21.10
the thing that I needed to focus on in that moment

1402
02:00:21.10 --> 02:00:23.24
to make the right decisions.

1403
02:00:23.24 --> 02:00:28.24
But I was, I, there's another great scene in Gates of Fire

1404
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.88
where the Spartans before battle will break the twigs

1405
02:00:33.88 --> 02:00:36.08
and they'll put half the twig in the basket.

1406
02:00:36.08 --> 02:00:40.28
It's like symbolic of a dog tag.

1407
02:00:40.28 --> 02:00:42.000
And so that if they get so disfigured,

1408
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.36
they match up the twigs at the end of the battle

1409
02:00:44.36 --> 02:00:46.000
and they say, okay, this is this guy.

1410
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.48
But there's another aspect of that.

1411
02:00:47.48 --> 02:00:50.04
It's they break off their humanity

1412
02:00:50.04 --> 02:00:53.32
because their sons or dads or their husbands

1413
02:00:53.32 --> 02:00:55.68
and they're about to go have to stick a zyphosword

1414
02:00:55.68 --> 02:00:56.60
into somebody's guts.

1415
02:00:56.60 --> 02:00:58.56
And so they've got to separate.

1416
02:00:58.56 --> 02:01:02.52
And I still had not separated my humanity

1417
02:01:02.52 --> 02:01:07.12
from the violent warrior killing and death

1418
02:01:07.12 --> 02:01:09.08
that I was so intimately.

1419
02:01:09.08 --> 02:01:10.44
That was the world I was living in.

1420
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:11.60
I think of like, if you think of it,

1421
02:01:11.60 --> 02:01:14.04
it gets like the river sticks, you know,

1422
02:01:14.04 --> 02:01:16.72
we had crossed the river sticks and we're living in Hades.

1423
02:01:16.72 --> 02:01:19.24
And I kind of had one foot on one shore

1424
02:01:19.24 --> 02:01:20.68
and one foot in hell.

1425
02:01:20.68 --> 02:01:25.68
And I was kind of just, and when I found out,

1426
02:01:26.28 --> 02:01:28.68
when I heard Cannes wasn't gonna make it,

1427
02:01:28.68 --> 02:01:29.64
he did ultimately make it.

1428
02:01:29.64 --> 02:01:33.56
But when I found that out, I just, I broke down.

1429
02:01:33.56 --> 02:01:36.80
And then I went back to my room

1430
02:01:36.80 --> 02:01:40.24
and I had stored away a little Snickers bar

1431
02:01:40.24 --> 02:01:42.04
at the bottom of my ruck.

1432
02:01:42.04 --> 02:01:44.04
And I thought, on a rainy day,

1433
02:01:44.04 --> 02:01:45.56
you will need this for your morale.

1434
02:01:45.56 --> 02:01:47.92
And I didn't think that rainy day was gonna be like

1435
02:01:47.92 --> 02:01:49.36
a weekend to happen to the deployment,

1436
02:01:49.36 --> 02:01:52.72
but I go to dig in my ruck and I find that

1437
02:01:52.72 --> 02:01:55.28
these little tailband mice have been living

1438
02:01:55.28 --> 02:01:58.60
and shitting in my ruck and they ate my Snickers bar.

1439
02:01:58.60 --> 02:02:01.68
And I had no more resilience left, you know?

1440
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:05.88
And so that was like the, and so I got sick.

1441
02:02:05.88 --> 02:02:07.48
I was puke and emotional.

1442
02:02:07.48 --> 02:02:09.76
Not in front of my troops, this was all private,

1443
02:02:09.76 --> 02:02:12.88
but it was at that point that I said,

1444
02:02:12.88 --> 02:02:16.44
you can't be feeling these things anymore.

1445
02:02:16.44 --> 02:02:20.60
Like you have a job and so you separate

1446
02:02:20.60 --> 02:02:23.44
from, you detach from that humanity

1447
02:02:23.44 --> 02:02:26.76
and everything is compartmentalized from that moment forward,

1448
02:02:26.76 --> 02:02:30.56
which makes you super effective under fire.

1449
02:02:30.56 --> 02:02:33.72
The issue is if you don't reconnect to that humanity

1450
02:02:33.72 --> 02:02:38.28
after your deployment, you become cold,

1451
02:02:38.28 --> 02:02:40.56
emotionally unavailable.

1452
02:02:40.56 --> 02:02:44.48
You don't experience the richness and fullness of life.

1453
02:02:44.48 --> 02:02:47.44
It's a really safe way to live, very compartmentalized

1454
02:02:47.44 --> 02:02:49.84
because I don't get too happy, I don't get too sad,

1455
02:02:50.84 --> 02:02:54.52
but it's not a very fulfilling way to live.

1456
02:02:54.52 --> 02:02:57.12
And the longer you, and you know,

1457
02:02:57.12 --> 02:02:59.000
I was right back in Afghanistan 12 months later.

1458
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.16
And so the longer you kind of keep all those nerve endings

1459
02:03:03.16 --> 02:03:05.60
dead so that you don't can't feel anything,

1460
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:07.76
longer is harder to turn them back on.

1461
02:03:07.76 --> 02:03:12.76
And also you start to get afraid of like,

1462
02:03:12.76 --> 02:03:17.24
what will I feel when I do turn all that stuff back on?

1463
02:03:17.24 --> 02:03:18.72
Because I've been packing stuff in the sea bag

1464
02:03:18.72 --> 02:03:20.72
for a long time here.

1465
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:23.24
And so what I convinced myself is,

1466
02:03:23.24 --> 02:03:25.64
is that like, hey, you don't have time.

1467
02:03:25.64 --> 02:03:27.52
You got troops to lead, you got stuff to do,

1468
02:03:27.52 --> 02:03:30.88
like you don't have, and what really what I found is like,

1469
02:03:30.88 --> 02:03:34.000
I didn't have the courage to turn them back on.

1470
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.32
I didn't have the courage to feel the things

1471
02:03:35.32 --> 02:03:36.64
that I needed to feel to figure out

1472
02:03:36.64 --> 02:03:38.20
what the hell was going on.

1473
02:03:38.20 --> 02:03:41.08
And I basically told myself a lie that said,

1474
02:03:41.08 --> 02:03:42.16
you're too busy, you're too busy,

1475
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:44.40
but really I was too scared to unpack that sea bag.

1476
02:03:44.40 --> 02:03:48.16
And as I said, good way to be in combat,

1477
02:03:48.16 --> 02:03:49.52
probably a bad way to live.

1478
02:03:50.48 --> 02:03:52.16
Well, I think it's important to,

1479
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:53.96
a lot of times things are going on around us

1480
02:03:53.96 --> 02:03:55.32
and we just don't know what they're happening.

1481
02:03:55.32 --> 02:03:57.96
So like you pointing that out,

1482
02:03:57.96 --> 02:03:59.48
it will help someone else go,

1483
02:03:59.48 --> 02:04:00.40
oh, I know what's going on.

1484
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:03.72
Like I know my wife, I was on deployment,

1485
02:04:03.72 --> 02:04:05.36
my wife sent me an email.

1486
02:04:05.36 --> 02:04:07.72
This is before FaceTime and stuff like this,

1487
02:04:07.72 --> 02:04:10.000
but she sent me an email and said,

1488
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.04
the kids wanna see a picture of where you sleep.

1489
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:15.36
Like, can you send a picture of where you sleep?

1490
02:04:15.36 --> 02:04:17.84
And I said, yep, got it.

1491
02:04:17.84 --> 02:04:20.76
And I remember I took a picture of,

1492
02:04:20.76 --> 02:04:24.44
like my little wooden plywood cot thing.

1493
02:04:24.44 --> 02:04:26.64
And I looked at it and I was like, oh, this isn't good.

1494
02:04:26.64 --> 02:04:31.64
And I pulled out from some dug down in some backpack,

1495
02:04:32.40 --> 02:04:34.40
grabbed some pictures of my wife and kids,

1496
02:04:34.40 --> 02:04:38.22
hung them up around the bed, took a picture,

1497
02:04:38.22 --> 02:04:41.74
took them back down, put them back in the folder

1498
02:04:41.74 --> 02:04:44.78
and back in the rucksack because the last thing

1499
02:04:44.78 --> 02:04:47.62
I needed to be doing was thinking about my wife and kids

1500
02:04:47.62 --> 02:04:49.98
when I got guys that are, you know,

1501
02:04:49.98 --> 02:04:52.46
counting on me to make decisions.

1502
02:04:53.90 --> 02:04:58.18
And I think that that was like a physical representation

1503
02:04:58.18 --> 02:05:00.46
that I knew what I was doing.

1504
02:05:00.46 --> 02:05:02.82
And I think that when I got home, I kind of knew,

1505
02:05:02.82 --> 02:05:05.94
okay, you can put these pictures back up now in your head.

1506
02:05:05.94 --> 02:05:07.34
And I think a lot of times,

1507
02:05:07.34 --> 02:05:09.38
like just you, the way you're describing that,

1508
02:05:09.38 --> 02:05:14.02
other people will recognize that,

1509
02:05:14.02 --> 02:05:15.58
oh, they took those pictures down.

1510
02:05:15.58 --> 02:05:17.82
They put them in a folder, they're not looking at them.

1511
02:05:17.82 --> 02:05:19.34
When you get done with that deployment,

1512
02:05:19.34 --> 02:05:22.34
you can open that folder back up and it's gonna be okay.

1513
02:05:23.82 --> 02:05:25.10
Important stuff to learn.

1514
02:05:27.10 --> 02:05:30.02
At this point, you meet Zach for the first time.

1515
02:05:30.02 --> 02:05:31.62
Seemed like you guys kicked it off pretty good,

1516
02:05:31.62 --> 02:05:33.58
hit it off pretty good right out of the gate.

1517
02:05:33.58 --> 02:05:37.54
Initially very transactional, he was a good interpreter.

1518
02:05:37.54 --> 02:05:39.98
He knew his past due, he knew English.

1519
02:05:39.98 --> 02:05:43.50
Up to that point, the only interpreters who were left

1520
02:05:43.50 --> 02:05:46.06
either didn't speak English or didn't speak the local dialect.

1521
02:05:46.06 --> 02:05:47.70
And so they knew they weren't gonna be able to get a job,

1522
02:05:47.70 --> 02:05:48.54
so they hung around.

1523
02:05:48.54 --> 02:05:52.66
And what I was finding is that every interpreter was quitting

1524
02:05:53.70 --> 02:05:57.42
or they were such a liability under fire

1525
02:05:57.42 --> 02:06:00.06
that we'd have bounded a couple hundred meters,

1526
02:06:00.06 --> 02:06:03.06
like where's the term and we gotta go.

1527
02:06:03.06 --> 02:06:08.06
And so we had had a rough, rough go with our interpreter.

1528
02:06:08.06 --> 02:06:10.78
So yeah, he shows up, he's fit, he's healthy,

1529
02:06:10.78 --> 02:06:13.14
he's not a coward and yeah, that's good.

1530
02:06:15.06 --> 02:06:17.42
Meanwhile, you're pushing, going to the book here.

1531
02:06:18.42 --> 02:06:20.34
In our first nine days of operations,

1532
02:06:20.34 --> 02:06:22.66
First Platoon had killed 15 Taliban.

1533
02:06:22.66 --> 02:06:24.54
We were fighting harder and killing more enemy

1534
02:06:24.54 --> 02:06:26.26
than any unit in three five.

1535
02:06:26.26 --> 02:06:27.98
By extension, that meant we were fighting

1536
02:06:27.98 --> 02:06:31.06
and killing more than any unit in Afghanistan.

1537
02:06:31.06 --> 02:06:33.90
I saw that as in keeping with my CO's direction

1538
02:06:33.90 --> 02:06:35.54
as I understood it.

1539
02:06:35.54 --> 02:06:37.90
But pushing that hard can create political

1540
02:06:37.90 --> 02:06:40.78
and personal issues that people more removed

1541
02:06:40.78 --> 02:06:43.30
from the sharp end of things can perceive

1542
02:06:43.30 --> 02:06:45.30
as unnecessary risk.

1543
02:06:45.30 --> 02:06:47.58
They may even be right, given the clarity

1544
02:06:47.58 --> 02:06:49.30
that distance can offer.

1545
02:06:49.30 --> 02:06:52.10
In my aggressive approach to the area of operations,

1546
02:06:52.10 --> 02:06:53.86
I followed the rules of engagement,

1547
02:06:53.86 --> 02:06:56.94
but I was not particularly attuned to political liability

1548
02:06:56.94 --> 02:07:00.50
that increased the farther anyone got from PB fires.

1549
02:07:00.50 --> 02:07:04.18
But I was consciously absorbing a lot of physical risk.

1550
02:07:04.18 --> 02:07:05.90
It made me short of patience with people

1551
02:07:05.90 --> 02:07:08.70
I saw as less engaged, which to be honest,

1552
02:07:08.70 --> 02:07:10.38
was everyone who was in Afghanistan

1553
02:07:10.38 --> 02:07:12.66
and not in First Platoon.

1554
02:07:12.66 --> 02:07:14.62
When I got back to PB fires that day,

1555
02:07:14.62 --> 02:07:16.82
the CO told me he was pulling First Platoon back

1556
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:18.78
to Fobb, increment over his concerns

1557
02:07:18.78 --> 02:07:22.02
that I required closer supervision.

1558
02:07:22.02 --> 02:07:24.58
We were moving, but thankfully,

1559
02:07:24.58 --> 02:07:26.02
Zach was coming with us.

1560
02:07:26.02 --> 02:07:31.02
We kind of addressed that,

1561
02:07:32.42 --> 02:07:35.58
the fact that that little disconnect showed up

1562
02:07:36.98 --> 02:07:39.94
between you and this is like,

1563
02:07:39.94 --> 02:07:41.94
I mean, how many books can you read,

1564
02:07:41.94 --> 02:07:44.94
movies can you watch about that disconnect

1565
02:07:44.94 --> 02:07:48.46
between the remps, the rear echelon motherfuckers

1566
02:07:48.46 --> 02:07:50.50
and the people on the front line?

1567
02:07:50.50 --> 02:07:56.94
There's a lot of documentation about that.

1568
02:07:57.94 --> 02:08:01.98
You just, you get back to Fobb, increment, like you said,

1569
02:08:01.98 --> 02:08:06.14
and the ops continue.

1570
02:08:06.14 --> 02:08:08.14
The ops are still going on.

1571
02:08:08.14 --> 02:08:09.46
Back to the book.

1572
02:08:09.46 --> 02:08:13.66
That command is a lonely, is a trite observation,

1573
02:08:13.66 --> 02:08:16.78
but it is no less true for the countless times

1574
02:08:16.78 --> 02:08:18.02
it's been observed.

1575
02:08:18.02 --> 02:08:19.46
It should be paired with the fact

1576
02:08:19.46 --> 02:08:20.94
that leadership hurts.

1577
02:08:20.94 --> 02:08:23.22
Every time you discipline a Marine that you love,

1578
02:08:23.22 --> 02:08:24.82
every time you watch them bleed,

1579
02:08:24.82 --> 02:08:29.42
every time you watch them breathe their last, it hurts.

1580
02:08:29.42 --> 02:08:31.90
I was 24 years old and living a reality

1581
02:08:31.90 --> 02:08:34.34
that I now look back upon and wonder

1582
02:08:34.34 --> 02:08:37.94
if some of it even truly happened.

1583
02:08:37.94 --> 02:08:40.62
I want to deny that humans could be so callous

1584
02:08:40.62 --> 02:08:43.78
as I became in the destruction of people put on this earth

1585
02:08:43.78 --> 02:08:45.94
by the same God I was.

1586
02:08:45.94 --> 02:08:49.38
I was convinced I would not survive Sengen,

1587
02:08:49.38 --> 02:08:52.26
but I had realized that life is a gift

1588
02:08:52.26 --> 02:08:56.42
and if I did survive, I had some growing up to do.

1589
02:08:56.42 --> 02:08:59.42
I prayed to God and asked that if I did survive,

1590
02:08:59.42 --> 02:09:02.06
he would help me live a grateful, meaningful life

1591
02:09:02.06 --> 02:09:04.70
that would do honor to the people denied that chance.

1592
02:09:04.70 --> 02:09:08.62
I was largely incapable of making any objective decisions

1593
02:09:08.62 --> 02:09:10.98
myself beyond where to patrol next

1594
02:09:10.98 --> 02:09:12.82
and how to fight through the next ambush,

1595
02:09:12.82 --> 02:09:17.46
but I was ready to acknowledge I was not the man

1596
02:09:17.46 --> 02:09:18.62
I professed to be.

1597
02:09:19.58 --> 02:09:22.58
I called Andrea and told her I wanted to be a better man

1598
02:09:22.58 --> 02:09:27.58
that I could only do that with her beside me.

1599
02:09:28.26 --> 02:09:30.86
I apologized for mistreating the woman who loved me

1600
02:09:30.86 --> 02:09:32.94
and begged her to take me back.

1601
02:09:32.94 --> 02:09:34.42
She agreed.

1602
02:09:34.42 --> 02:09:37.18
Though I still thought it unlikely I would ever live

1603
02:09:37.18 --> 02:09:42.74
to see her again, the idea was something to live for.

1604
02:09:43.38 --> 02:09:47.14
At some point that evening, the CO came in and told me

1605
02:09:47.14 --> 02:09:49.78
that my friend and mentor, Lieutenant Robert Kelly,

1606
02:09:49.78 --> 02:09:52.78
was dead, struck and killed instantly

1607
02:09:52.78 --> 02:09:54.94
by an IED earlier that day.

1608
02:09:56.74 --> 02:09:59.70
I rolled over and stared at the wall.

1609
02:09:59.70 --> 02:10:03.46
I thought about Rob, Cam West, and me spending the last day

1610
02:10:03.46 --> 02:10:05.78
before we deployed drinking beer at Del Mar

1611
02:10:05.78 --> 02:10:07.26
with Robert and his family.

1612
02:10:10.10 --> 02:10:12.70
The next day was the 245th birthday

1613
02:10:12.70 --> 02:10:14.30
of the United States Marine Corps.

1614
02:10:15.14 --> 02:10:17.30
First platoon killed four Taliban.

1615
02:10:18.98 --> 02:10:20.50
It didn't bring anyone back.

1616
02:10:25.50 --> 02:10:29.78
By Thanksgiving 2010, most of my closest friends in 3.5,

1617
02:10:29.78 --> 02:10:31.90
Rob, Kelly, Cam West, Will Donnelly

1618
02:10:31.90 --> 02:10:36.10
and Gunnery Sergeant Carlisle had been killed or wounded.

1619
02:10:36.10 --> 02:10:39.26
Only Staff Sergeant Henley and Lieutenant Vic Garcia

1620
02:10:39.26 --> 02:10:42.18
who replaced Cam at PB Fires with 3rd platoon remained.

1621
02:10:43.54 --> 02:10:45.78
I only saw Vic in passing.

1622
02:10:45.78 --> 02:10:48.58
Another IOC classmate, James Biler,

1623
02:10:48.58 --> 02:10:51.66
had been horribly wounded, losing both his legs.

1624
02:10:53.50 --> 02:10:55.38
The death or grievous injury of friends

1625
02:10:55.38 --> 02:10:57.30
with whom I had been living, training and fighting

1626
02:10:57.30 --> 02:10:59.94
for two years left me feeling dead inside.

1627
02:10:59.94 --> 02:11:03.98
I was just waiting for my body to catch up.

1628
02:11:05.94 --> 02:11:09.22
We'd arrived in Sengen in October 2010

1629
02:11:09.22 --> 02:11:11.90
and settled into a life of brutal sameness.

1630
02:11:11.90 --> 02:11:15.34
We patrolled through suffocating heat and penetrating cold,

1631
02:11:15.34 --> 02:11:18.54
sometimes multiple hour long patrols in a day.

1632
02:11:18.54 --> 02:11:20.10
We engaged the elders.

1633
02:11:20.10 --> 02:11:21.98
We did post-blast analysis.

1634
02:11:21.98 --> 02:11:23.34
We responded to ambushes.

1635
02:11:23.34 --> 02:11:24.34
We called in medivacs.

1636
02:11:24.34 --> 02:11:25.62
We called in air support.

1637
02:11:25.62 --> 02:11:31.30
We zipped our friends into bags for a final ride home.

1638
02:11:31.30 --> 02:11:33.42
They were men I loved because I knew them

1639
02:11:33.42 --> 02:11:36.34
or I loved despite not knowing them for the simple fact

1640
02:11:36.34 --> 02:11:39.54
that they had volunteered to serve as Marine infantry men

1641
02:11:39.54 --> 02:11:41.10
in a time when that meant war.

1642
02:11:44.02 --> 02:11:46.38
But it was harder and harder to feel that emotion

1643
02:11:46.38 --> 02:11:48.54
as the toll of dead and wounded grew

1644
02:11:48.54 --> 02:11:55.98
and I felt increasingly ground under the wheels of war.

1645
02:11:55.98 --> 02:12:09.26
So this is the burden of command that you're talking about.

1646
02:12:09.26 --> 02:12:13.02
And as you mentioned, it's a burden that leaders

1647
02:12:13.02 --> 02:12:20.42
have to bear alone.

1648
02:12:20.42 --> 02:12:22.70
And what's interesting and it's an interesting,

1649
02:12:22.70 --> 02:12:25.10
I mean, this is what the book is about,

1650
02:12:25.10 --> 02:12:30.94
is that you actually had an outlet for this.

1651
02:12:30.94 --> 02:12:38.70
And that outlet ended up being your interpreter, Zach.

1652
02:12:38.70 --> 02:12:40.66
He wasn't a Marine.

1653
02:12:40.66 --> 02:12:46.38
He was, there was no mask to put on with Zach.

1654
02:12:49.02 --> 02:12:52.86
How did that relationship grow and develop?

1655
02:12:52.86 --> 02:12:58.10
Out of necessity for my sanity is kind of how it came to be.

1656
02:12:58.10 --> 02:13:04.30
And this idea that war is both heaven and hell

1657
02:13:04.30 --> 02:13:08.50
and that each day you're experiencing

1658
02:13:08.50 --> 02:13:11.98
the worst depravity that you can imagine.

1659
02:13:11.98 --> 02:13:15.42
But then you're seeing no greater love

1660
02:13:15.42 --> 02:13:17.70
that has a man who laid down his life for his friends.

1661
02:13:17.70 --> 02:13:22.06
You're seeing the greatest forms of love manifested

1662
02:13:22.06 --> 02:13:25.18
where someone willingly lays down their life for their friend.

1663
02:13:25.18 --> 02:13:29.38
And so you get these little glimpses of heaven and hell.

1664
02:13:29.38 --> 02:13:33.34
And through that, you start to grow and mature.

1665
02:13:33.34 --> 02:13:36.70
And General Madness kind of talks about it.

1666
02:13:36.70 --> 02:13:42.38
He got his PhD in combat, that you learn so much about life

1667
02:13:42.38 --> 02:13:45.62
in five minutes in a firefight that maybe could take

1668
02:13:45.62 --> 02:13:46.98
five years outside of it.

1669
02:13:46.98 --> 02:13:50.86
And so I'm refining my character.

1670
02:13:50.86 --> 02:13:52.18
I'm growing up finally.

1671
02:13:52.18 --> 02:13:53.30
I was a little boy.

1672
02:13:53.30 --> 02:13:55.06
And I went to the combat a little boy.

1673
02:13:55.06 --> 02:13:58.50
And I finally start to say, it's time for you to be a man.

1674
02:13:58.50 --> 02:14:01.90
And none of this is guaranteed.

1675
02:14:01.90 --> 02:14:05.22
And if you do make it, what are you going to do differently?

1676
02:14:05.22 --> 02:14:09.50
Because what you profess is not congruent with your actions.

1677
02:14:09.50 --> 02:14:12.02
And so first time I get the sat phone,

1678
02:14:12.02 --> 02:14:15.14
I call Andrew a little cry and a little sad.

1679
02:14:15.14 --> 02:14:16.22
I know I broke up with you.

1680
02:14:16.22 --> 02:14:17.74
Please forgive me.

1681
02:14:17.74 --> 02:14:18.54
Take me back.

1682
02:14:21.46 --> 02:14:27.38
And then you kind of hinted at this idea

1683
02:14:27.38 --> 02:14:31.70
that as the junior officer, you are the dam.

1684
02:14:31.70 --> 02:14:37.30
You're between two rushing tides, higher, and then

1685
02:14:37.30 --> 02:14:39.10
your troops and your subordinates.

1686
02:14:39.10 --> 02:14:42.10
And so you are in the middle of this.

1687
02:14:42.10 --> 02:14:46.70
And so you're trying to keep all the crap from rolling down

1688
02:14:46.70 --> 02:14:47.30
hill on them.

1689
02:14:47.30 --> 02:14:49.26
But at the same time, you've got all this stuff bubbling up,

1690
02:14:49.26 --> 02:14:51.06
because you've got a bunch of 18-year-old kids that

1691
02:14:51.06 --> 02:14:53.54
got stuff going on in the lives that are losing their own friends.

1692
02:14:53.54 --> 02:14:54.98
And it's all valid.

1693
02:14:54.98 --> 02:14:55.82
It's all valid.

1694
02:14:55.82 --> 02:14:57.38
It's almost all valid, I should say.

1695
02:14:57.38 --> 02:15:02.78
And it's you who's the mediator of all this pressure

1696
02:15:02.78 --> 02:15:05.38
from higher and the bubbling up from your sport.

1697
02:15:05.38 --> 02:15:07.58
Plus you've got some stuff going on in your own life.

1698
02:15:07.58 --> 02:15:09.30
You're trying to get back with your girlfriend,

1699
02:15:09.30 --> 02:15:11.70
your best friends, getting killed or injured.

1700
02:15:11.70 --> 02:15:13.30
And so you've got your own.

1701
02:15:13.30 --> 02:15:18.98
And you've got to be this person, this intermediary

1702
02:15:18.98 --> 02:15:20.46
in between all that.

1703
02:15:20.46 --> 02:15:24.50
And the pressure, you just keep absorbing pressure,

1704
02:15:24.50 --> 02:15:26.82
because you don't want to pass it to your troops.

1705
02:15:26.82 --> 02:15:29.46
And you can't pass it to hire.

1706
02:15:29.46 --> 02:15:33.58
And so an outlet was critical.

1707
02:15:33.58 --> 02:15:36.10
And because you can't.

1708
02:15:36.10 --> 02:15:37.98
Like my platoon sergeant had been through enough.

1709
02:15:37.98 --> 02:15:39.14
Like I couldn't.

1710
02:15:39.14 --> 02:15:41.14
He was dealing with all the same crap.

1711
02:15:41.14 --> 02:15:43.90
And so I didn't want to put anything else on his plate.

1712
02:15:43.90 --> 02:15:48.98
And there's really only one person who I could vent to.

1713
02:15:48.98 --> 02:15:50.46
And that was Zach.

1714
02:15:50.46 --> 02:15:57.02
And yeah, it really helped me maintain my sanity.

1715
02:15:57.02 --> 02:16:05.02
So this book, again, I'm reading less than 10%.

1716
02:16:05.02 --> 02:16:07.82
I'm reading 4% of this book.

1717
02:16:07.82 --> 02:16:10.58
You have a ton of experiences here

1718
02:16:10.58 --> 02:16:11.58
that you talk about.

1719
02:16:11.58 --> 02:16:13.74
I'm trying to get some of the high points.

1720
02:16:13.74 --> 02:16:16.10
You develop this awesome relationship with Zach,

1721
02:16:16.10 --> 02:16:17.94
who's a good listener.

1722
02:16:17.94 --> 02:16:22.58
And who you can talk to about what's going on.

1723
02:16:22.58 --> 02:16:24.38
Fast forward a little bit.

1724
02:16:24.38 --> 02:16:25.90
Actually, fast forward quite a bit.

1725
02:16:25.90 --> 02:16:28.70
This is a seven month deployment.

1726
02:16:28.70 --> 02:16:29.18
Yes.

1727
02:16:29.18 --> 02:16:30.74
So it's a seven month deployment.

1728
02:16:30.74 --> 02:16:34.18
I think we covered maybe one or two operations.

1729
02:16:34.18 --> 02:16:38.50
I'm going to go all the way forward to,

1730
02:16:38.50 --> 02:16:40.86
I think it was your last stop, or certainly

1731
02:16:40.86 --> 02:16:41.94
one of your last stops.

1732
02:16:41.94 --> 02:16:47.66
This is a turnover operation, which is always

1733
02:16:47.66 --> 02:16:49.78
sketchy anyways, because you've got a bunch of people that

1734
02:16:49.78 --> 02:16:50.42
are coming in.

1735
02:16:50.42 --> 02:16:51.30
They have their ideas.

1736
02:16:51.30 --> 02:16:52.10
You have your ideas.

1737
02:16:52.10 --> 02:16:54.38
And if they're not open to your ideas,

1738
02:16:54.38 --> 02:16:58.06
it's going to be a lot harder.

1739
02:16:58.06 --> 02:17:05.74
There's an area outside the wire that's called the golf course.

1740
02:17:05.74 --> 02:17:07.78
And when you guys go on patrol, you

1741
02:17:07.78 --> 02:17:10.10
stay away from the golf course because it's filled with IDs.

1742
02:17:10.10 --> 02:17:11.38
You guys go out on patrol.

1743
02:17:11.38 --> 02:17:12.66
When you leave to go out on patrol,

1744
02:17:12.66 --> 02:17:14.42
you guys are going through the village

1745
02:17:14.42 --> 02:17:16.46
where there's a bunch of Afghans running around.

1746
02:17:16.46 --> 02:17:18.50
So you can't put a bunch of pressure plate IEDs.

1747
02:17:18.50 --> 02:17:22.58
So it's a lot less IEDs.

1748
02:17:22.58 --> 02:17:23.42
New Lieutenant.

1749
02:17:23.42 --> 02:17:26.42
So on this op, is it mostly your guys,

1750
02:17:26.42 --> 02:17:27.66
or is it mostly his guys?

1751
02:17:27.66 --> 02:17:29.94
No, it's the last of the left seat, right seat.

1752
02:17:29.94 --> 02:17:32.90
So it's just me and two sergeants and all his guys.

1753
02:17:32.90 --> 02:17:34.22
And it's all his guys.

1754
02:17:34.22 --> 02:17:37.98
He wants to go out and patrol through the golf course.

1755
02:17:37.98 --> 02:17:43.02
You strongly recommend that that's not a great idea.

1756
02:17:43.02 --> 02:17:49.54
He decides that it is a good idea and he's going to go out.

1757
02:17:49.54 --> 02:17:51.54
Going to take the patrol out through the golf course.

1758
02:17:54.30 --> 02:17:57.90
Guy hits a low order IED out of the gate.

1759
02:17:57.90 --> 02:17:59.82
What happens then?

1760
02:17:59.82 --> 02:18:04.50
So Sergeant Nykirk was one of my two other Marines

1761
02:18:04.50 --> 02:18:06.50
that were on that patrol.

1762
02:18:06.50 --> 02:18:08.18
I see him go up in the yellow smoke.

1763
02:18:08.18 --> 02:18:10.94
And I think, son of a bitch.

1764
02:18:10.94 --> 02:18:14.90
And when I get up to him, he's standing

1765
02:18:14.90 --> 02:18:18.54
on top of a 105 shell with a yellow jug underneath it.

1766
02:18:18.54 --> 02:18:21.74
And the yellow jug just as barely cracked open.

1767
02:18:21.74 --> 02:18:25.14
And we're only 100 meters outside the patrol base

1768
02:18:25.14 --> 02:18:25.66
at this point.

1769
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:28.50
So we call EOD to come from the company position.

1770
02:18:28.50 --> 02:18:31.74
They come out and they say, 105 shell on a 40-pound jug

1771
02:18:31.74 --> 02:18:33.90
would have killed a couple people in front,

1772
02:18:33.90 --> 02:18:35.98
a couple people in back.

1773
02:18:35.98 --> 02:18:39.62
Nykirk, you would be in little pieces.

1774
02:18:39.62 --> 02:18:42.70
And they said, this is actually a tripwire IED.

1775
02:18:42.70 --> 02:18:44.86
This is the first time we've seen this in this AO.

1776
02:18:44.86 --> 02:18:48.86
We've never seen this little fish line that you kick.

1777
02:18:48.86 --> 02:18:51.22
And it was two little branches.

1778
02:18:51.22 --> 02:18:53.22
And you kick the little fish wire.

1779
02:18:53.22 --> 02:18:53.94
You can't see it.

1780
02:18:53.94 --> 02:18:55.90
And that's what closed the circuit rather than a pressure

1781
02:18:55.90 --> 02:18:56.30
plate.

1782
02:18:59.62 --> 02:19:02.66
And so they reduce the IED.

1783
02:19:02.66 --> 02:19:06.98
Nykirk has HME, the homemade explosives, all over his face.

1784
02:19:06.98 --> 02:19:08.02
He's been doused in it.

1785
02:19:08.02 --> 02:19:10.22
He's jittery.

1786
02:19:10.22 --> 02:19:13.10
Can I go back with EOD back to the CP?

1787
02:19:13.10 --> 02:19:15.34
And I'm like, yeah, go ahead.

1788
02:19:15.34 --> 02:19:17.54
And Decker, my third squad leader,

1789
02:19:17.54 --> 02:19:19.66
turns to me and says, can I go back with them too?

1790
02:19:19.66 --> 02:19:22.82
Because these guys, they're going to get us killed.

1791
02:19:22.82 --> 02:19:24.42
And I just had a son on this deployment.

1792
02:19:24.42 --> 02:19:26.62
And I haven't met my son yet.

1793
02:19:26.62 --> 02:19:29.46
He named his son Maximum Danger Decker, by the way.

1794
02:19:29.46 --> 02:19:33.74
And the kind of guy he is, he's still in.

1795
02:19:33.74 --> 02:19:34.50
One of my heroes.

1796
02:19:34.50 --> 02:19:38.54
And I'm like, hey, Decker, if stuff goes sideways out here,

1797
02:19:38.54 --> 02:19:41.30
I need at least one other person I know that I can rely on.

1798
02:19:41.30 --> 02:19:43.18
Like, sorry, you got to stay.

1799
02:19:46.18 --> 02:19:48.70
And he's not happy about it, but Roger.

1800
02:19:48.70 --> 02:19:52.14
And you still couldn't convince the new lieutenant, like, hey,

1801
02:19:52.14 --> 02:19:54.62
bro, remember when I said this was a bad idea?

1802
02:19:54.62 --> 02:19:59.30
We just got the absolute luckiest thing we could have ever

1803
02:19:59.30 --> 02:19:59.90
hoped for.

1804
02:19:59.90 --> 02:20:00.50
Yeah.

1805
02:20:00.50 --> 02:20:03.86
Let's backtrack and try this again tomorrow.

1806
02:20:03.86 --> 02:20:04.36
Correct.

1807
02:20:04.36 --> 02:20:06.42
Couldn't talk him off, crossing the field.

1808
02:20:06.42 --> 02:20:08.42
But what I was able to do is convince him that, hey,

1809
02:20:08.42 --> 02:20:11.46
send the engineer who's already on the far side

1810
02:20:11.46 --> 02:20:14.54
to sweep back through the field, because he's clearly

1811
02:20:14.54 --> 02:20:18.50
missed at least one IED that should have had a pretty big

1812
02:20:18.50 --> 02:20:20.34
signature coming off a 105 shell.

1813
02:20:20.34 --> 02:20:23.18
So he's going to re-sweep if we're going to push through

1814
02:20:23.18 --> 02:20:23.70
this field.

1815
02:20:23.70 --> 02:20:28.42
And as that guy starts to sweep back, goes up.

1816
02:20:28.42 --> 02:20:32.46
And immediately, huge ambush.

1817
02:20:32.46 --> 02:20:35.26
I mean, just firing from everywhere.

1818
02:20:35.26 --> 02:20:38.34
And this is this unit's first time in contact.

1819
02:20:38.34 --> 02:20:41.74
So they're just heads down, just not looking where they're

1820
02:20:41.74 --> 02:20:45.66
firing, just blossom, shooting everywhere.

1821
02:20:45.66 --> 02:20:48.70
And there's only one Marine who's standing up, running

1822
02:20:48.70 --> 02:20:50.86
into the field to go get the guy who got this blown up.

1823
02:20:50.86 --> 02:20:54.06
And it's Sergeant Decker, the guy who just said a few minutes

1824
02:20:54.06 --> 02:20:55.38
before, hey, sir, can I go back?

1825
02:20:55.38 --> 02:20:57.30
Because I've never met my son.

1826
02:20:57.30 --> 02:20:59.18
I'm like, OK, well, now he's going to be dead.

1827
02:20:59.18 --> 02:21:01.74
And the last thing I'm going to live with forever

1828
02:21:01.74 --> 02:21:06.06
is that this kid will never meet his dad.

1829
02:21:06.06 --> 02:21:08.82
And so I'm able to flag him down.

1830
02:21:08.82 --> 02:21:10.02
I'm like, you're not going to go.

1831
02:21:10.02 --> 02:21:12.22
I'm going to go.

1832
02:21:12.22 --> 02:21:15.38
But just getting across the canal towards the field,

1833
02:21:15.38 --> 02:21:17.90
I mean, the canal looked like it was like a hellstorm,

1834
02:21:17.90 --> 02:21:20.34
with just the bullets ripping through the water,

1835
02:21:20.34 --> 02:21:22.34
hitting all the sides of the dirt.

1836
02:21:22.34 --> 02:21:26.90
And so just it was, and so I'm running along the line.

1837
02:21:26.90 --> 02:21:27.98
I'm like, where's the corpsman?

1838
02:21:27.98 --> 02:21:28.54
Where's the corpsman?

1839
02:21:28.54 --> 02:21:29.98
Where's the corpsman?

1840
02:21:29.98 --> 02:21:31.46
Finally, one little hand goes up.

1841
02:21:31.46 --> 02:21:32.78
I'm like, grabbed by the troop staff.

1842
02:21:32.78 --> 02:21:33.70
I'm like, you're following me.

1843
02:21:33.70 --> 02:21:35.98
I'm like, Decker, you call in the medivac.

1844
02:21:35.98 --> 02:21:38.62
I'll go out there and get this guy.

1845
02:21:38.62 --> 02:21:41.26
And I'm the only guy standing up.

1846
02:21:41.26 --> 02:21:44.70
And so the machine gun, the P-CAM,

1847
02:21:44.70 --> 02:21:46.78
is just following me through this field.

1848
02:21:46.78 --> 02:21:52.50
And as I enter into this field, I'm like, 105 shell

1849
02:21:52.50 --> 02:21:54.70
on top of a 40-pound jug.

1850
02:21:54.70 --> 02:21:57.98
The kids told us that they said they saw them at least put

1851
02:21:57.98 --> 02:22:01.46
15 to 20 IDs in this field.

1852
02:22:01.46 --> 02:22:02.78
We were on a big op.

1853
02:22:02.78 --> 02:22:05.86
We had just left a skeleton security.

1854
02:22:05.86 --> 02:22:08.50
And this place was in low ground.

1855
02:22:08.50 --> 02:22:09.70
We couldn't see it.

1856
02:22:09.70 --> 02:22:12.70
And so the tailband puts at least 15 to 20 IDs in there.

1857
02:22:12.70 --> 02:22:14.46
We've been in this field for five minutes.

1858
02:22:14.46 --> 02:22:16.18
It hit two of them.

1859
02:22:16.18 --> 02:22:20.02
So I'm going in this field thinking, best case scenario,

1860
02:22:20.02 --> 02:22:24.66
no legs, ML COA, most likely course of action here.

1861
02:22:24.66 --> 02:22:25.62
You are dead.

1862
02:22:25.62 --> 02:22:26.62
And then a lot of pieces.

1863
02:22:26.62 --> 02:22:28.54
People are picking you up with a vacuum.

1864
02:22:31.02 --> 02:22:33.86
And I'm also like, the P-CAM is just

1865
02:22:33.86 --> 02:22:35.38
following me the whole way through.

1866
02:22:35.38 --> 02:22:36.66
I'm a tall guy with a big head.

1867
02:22:36.66 --> 02:22:38.82
They're just like, yeah, that's an easy target.

1868
02:22:38.82 --> 02:22:39.94
Shoot that thing.

1869
02:22:39.94 --> 02:22:45.98
And every time I put my foot down, I'm like, mother fucker.

1870
02:22:45.98 --> 02:22:49.90
And we get to the casualty, start the treatment

1871
02:22:49.90 --> 02:22:51.62
on the casualty.

1872
02:22:51.62 --> 02:22:56.70
He's got it lowered or deaded again, but it heaved him up

1873
02:22:56.70 --> 02:22:57.94
and slammed him down.

1874
02:22:57.94 --> 02:23:00.58
And his head of compound fascia, his arm bone

1875
02:23:00.58 --> 02:23:01.30
was sticking through.

1876
02:23:01.30 --> 02:23:02.50
And so I'm like, OK, that's good.

1877
02:23:02.50 --> 02:23:03.74
That's not a big deal.

1878
02:23:03.74 --> 02:23:05.26
Doc, you got that.

1879
02:23:05.26 --> 02:23:08.30
And I've been carrying them M32 for a couple weeks.

1880
02:23:08.30 --> 02:23:10.42
And it's a six shooter grenade launcher.

1881
02:23:10.42 --> 02:23:12.62
It's like a revolver that shoots grenades.

1882
02:23:12.62 --> 02:23:14.10
And I'm like, yeah.

1883
02:23:14.10 --> 02:23:14.70
Get some.

1884
02:23:14.70 --> 02:23:18.10
And so I got to pop some nugs.

1885
02:23:18.10 --> 02:23:18.94
Six-piece nugs.

1886
02:23:18.94 --> 02:23:19.98
Nope, 12-piece nugs.

1887
02:23:19.98 --> 02:23:22.34
Well, how many nugs do you need before you quiet down?

1888
02:23:22.34 --> 02:23:27.70
And I'm able to get these guys to break contact.

1889
02:23:30.38 --> 02:23:33.90
But now I'm thinking, OK, now I got to walk back with this guy.

1890
02:23:33.90 --> 02:23:35.74
Because when I'm running out, I'm

1891
02:23:35.74 --> 02:23:36.90
thinking I'm going to get shot.

1892
02:23:36.90 --> 02:23:38.70
I'm thinking I got to go help this Marine.

1893
02:23:38.70 --> 02:23:40.02
Oh, I don't even know this Marine.

1894
02:23:40.02 --> 02:23:41.46
He's from the different unit, but he's a Marine,

1895
02:23:41.46 --> 02:23:42.74
so it doesn't matter.

1896
02:23:42.74 --> 02:23:45.50
At that point, I am thinking with every step,

1897
02:23:45.50 --> 02:23:47.22
like little pucker factor for sure.

1898
02:23:47.22 --> 02:23:51.18
But there's a lot compelling me forward, like not getting shot

1899
02:23:51.18 --> 02:23:52.86
and trying to get to this guy.

1900
02:23:52.86 --> 02:23:55.22
And now I'm like, OK, well, now we got to walk back.

1901
02:23:55.22 --> 02:23:57.62
And this is the engineer.

1902
02:23:57.62 --> 02:23:59.10
So he's the guy that sweeps the ground.

1903
02:23:59.10 --> 02:24:06.10
And so, yeah, it was a tail bend did not treat me nice.

1904
02:24:06.10 --> 02:24:09.54
I'm a way out, that's for sure.

1905
02:24:09.54 --> 02:24:10.10
You get back.

1906
02:24:10.10 --> 02:24:12.26
You get the wounded guy back to the line.

1907
02:24:12.26 --> 02:24:16.26
You look at the lieutenant, and you say this patrol's over.

1908
02:24:16.26 --> 02:24:19.54
At which point he admits, I guess I should have listened

1909
02:24:19.54 --> 02:24:21.90
to you about the route.

1910
02:24:21.90 --> 02:24:23.46
It's just a thing about combat.

1911
02:24:23.46 --> 02:24:29.18
It's so unique is that everybody can live the same experience,

1912
02:24:29.18 --> 02:24:31.46
but have a different version of it.

1913
02:24:31.46 --> 02:24:36.18
And so this guy is a super talented guy, way smarter than me.

1914
02:24:36.18 --> 02:24:37.78
He did great stuff with that platoon.

1915
02:24:37.78 --> 02:24:40.66
So I have nothing but great stuff to say about him.

1916
02:24:40.66 --> 02:24:43.70
He remembers it some of these details differently.

1917
02:24:43.70 --> 02:24:46.66
So I will put that out there.

1918
02:24:46.66 --> 02:24:50.02
I remember this clear as day to me, from my perspective,

1919
02:24:50.02 --> 02:24:51.54
is this how it happened.

1920
02:24:51.54 --> 02:24:56.14
But yeah, we agreed, patrol's over.

1921
02:24:56.14 --> 02:24:58.34
He said, yeah, that was maybe going through the golf course

1922
02:24:58.34 --> 02:24:59.14
wasn't the right call.

1923
02:24:59.14 --> 02:25:00.78
I said, yeah, I think so.

1924
02:25:00.78 --> 02:25:02.86
And when I smoked my first cigarette.

1925
02:25:02.86 --> 02:25:06.30
Did you talk to him while you were writing this?

1926
02:25:06.30 --> 02:25:09.86
I posted something about it one day.

1927
02:25:09.86 --> 02:25:12.42
Again, not inditing him, not calling him out,

1928
02:25:12.42 --> 02:25:16.10
but just talking about talking through this patrol.

1929
02:25:16.10 --> 02:25:17.58
And he had sent me the message.

1930
02:25:17.58 --> 02:25:22.30
He's like, well, here's how I saw that all unfold.

1931
02:25:22.30 --> 02:25:24.78
And again, there's no animosity.

1932
02:25:24.78 --> 02:25:26.94
There's a ton of mutual respect.

1933
02:25:26.94 --> 02:25:30.74
Nobody knows, well, besides Vic Garcia,

1934
02:25:30.74 --> 02:25:33.34
I think who was the my adjacent platoon commander out there

1935
02:25:33.34 --> 02:25:34.94
out there in the northern green zone.

1936
02:25:34.94 --> 02:25:39.54
Nobody else can empathize with what

1937
02:25:39.54 --> 02:25:41.18
we were doing on the edge of the empire

1938
02:25:41.18 --> 02:25:43.14
and the most kinetic area of operations

1939
02:25:43.14 --> 02:25:44.06
more than this guy.

1940
02:25:44.06 --> 02:25:46.10
So there's a lot of mutual respect.

1941
02:25:46.10 --> 02:25:50.82
But yeah, we had our difference of opinion there.

1942
02:25:50.82 --> 02:25:53.46
You smoked your first cigarette after this operation.

1943
02:25:53.46 --> 02:25:56.10
Yeah.

1944
02:25:56.10 --> 02:25:57.22
You said.

1945
02:25:57.22 --> 02:26:01.90
And that's it, right, for this deployment.

1946
02:26:01.90 --> 02:26:04.74
You leave Zach.

1947
02:26:04.74 --> 02:26:05.66
You talk about the fact.

1948
02:26:05.66 --> 02:26:09.14
You talk about what that's like when

1949
02:26:09.14 --> 02:26:11.38
you're leaving Zach basically on the tarmac.

1950
02:26:11.38 --> 02:26:14.86
You had this great relationship with him.

1951
02:26:14.86 --> 02:26:17.06
He ends up getting a job, another translating job.

1952
02:26:17.06 --> 02:26:19.90
He ends up leaving that AO as well.

1953
02:26:19.90 --> 02:26:22.74
But we'll get into some of that.

1954
02:26:22.74 --> 02:26:27.42
But it's you at this juncture returning home.

1955
02:26:27.42 --> 02:26:30.38
I'm going to go to the book.

1956
02:26:30.38 --> 02:26:35.38
On April 20, 2011, I landed back on US soil.

1957
02:26:35.38 --> 02:26:37.18
I was 25 years old.

1958
02:26:37.18 --> 02:26:40.58
Had had just lived a lifetime on fast forward.

1959
02:26:40.58 --> 02:26:42.14
My body was battered.

1960
02:26:42.14 --> 02:26:45.30
And my brain was traumatized by multiple blasts,

1961
02:26:45.30 --> 02:26:48.10
the type of injuries sustained by so many of us

1962
02:26:48.10 --> 02:26:51.06
in the post-911 wars.

1963
02:26:51.06 --> 02:26:53.86
But I also came home from Sangen, exhausted,

1964
02:26:53.86 --> 02:26:58.90
embittered, angry, and unsure how to express any of it.

1965
02:26:58.90 --> 02:27:01.58
There was no way to physically represent the moral injuries

1966
02:27:01.58 --> 02:27:02.74
I had sustained.

1967
02:27:02.74 --> 02:27:06.06
And I did not know a way to talk about them,

1968
02:27:06.06 --> 02:27:08.78
though they were evident to anyone who knew me.

1969
02:27:08.78 --> 02:27:12.34
I was still angry at what I had felt had been

1970
02:27:12.34 --> 02:27:15.22
Kilo Company headquarters punishing me for aggressively

1971
02:27:15.22 --> 02:27:17.70
implementing orders I was given.

1972
02:27:17.70 --> 02:27:21.62
I was depressed by the death and injury of my friends.

1973
02:27:21.62 --> 02:27:25.50
I was physically rung out from seven months of insomnia,

1974
02:27:25.50 --> 02:27:29.42
long daily movements under load, and the accumulated stress

1975
02:27:29.42 --> 02:27:31.74
of leading young men in a place where someone

1976
02:27:31.74 --> 02:27:35.78
was trying to kill all of us every day.

1977
02:27:35.78 --> 02:27:40.14
Strangely, like an addict having withdrawals,

1978
02:27:40.14 --> 02:27:42.62
I still missed the almost daily combat

1979
02:27:42.62 --> 02:27:46.02
for the first four months of our deployment.

1980
02:27:46.02 --> 02:27:50.38
Worse yet, just as an IED does invisible damage to Marines,

1981
02:27:50.38 --> 02:27:54.78
as its shockwave passes through their soft internal organs,

1982
02:27:54.78 --> 02:27:58.26
people in my orbit were suffering from my injuries.

1983
02:27:58.26 --> 02:28:00.46
In the week before we got back, my mom

1984
02:28:00.46 --> 02:28:03.42
was counting the hours through sleepless nights

1985
02:28:03.42 --> 02:28:05.66
at work or inability to stop crying

1986
02:28:05.66 --> 02:28:06.70
in a bathroom.

1987
02:28:06.70 --> 02:28:10.30
Stahl got her sent home for the day to recover.

1988
02:28:10.30 --> 02:28:16.34
When she met me in Southern California on return,

1989
02:28:16.34 --> 02:28:19.74
she tried to talk to me about how I was feeling.

1990
02:28:19.74 --> 02:28:21.34
I didn't want to talk about it.

1991
02:28:21.34 --> 02:28:23.38
My desire not to talk never really

1992
02:28:23.38 --> 02:28:25.46
mattered where my mom is concerned, especially

1993
02:28:25.46 --> 02:28:30.54
after she took it upon herself to read my journal from Sangen.

1994
02:28:30.54 --> 02:28:32.98
I was angry at the violation of my privacy.

1995
02:28:32.98 --> 02:28:35.90
Thomas, I can't understand what happened over there

1996
02:28:35.90 --> 02:28:37.46
because you won't talk about it.

1997
02:28:37.46 --> 02:28:39.14
Mom, I'm fine.

1998
02:28:39.14 --> 02:28:42.58
Then please make eye contact with me when I'm talking to you.

1999
02:28:42.58 --> 02:28:44.22
Would you just let it go?

2000
02:28:44.22 --> 02:28:46.42
Thomas, you're my son and my best friend.

2001
02:28:46.42 --> 02:28:49.02
You have been since you were born.

2002
02:28:49.02 --> 02:28:50.82
It's like you're not there anymore.

2003
02:28:50.82 --> 02:28:53.66
You're just this angry person and I'm on eggshells.

2004
02:28:53.66 --> 02:28:56.78
I'm not letting anything go.

2005
02:28:56.78 --> 02:28:58.50
What do you want to say to me, mom?

2006
02:28:58.50 --> 02:29:03.26
I said, I'm fine.

2007
02:29:03.26 --> 02:29:09.38
So doing just fine, huh?

2008
02:29:09.38 --> 02:29:11.74
You weren't exactly fine.

2009
02:29:11.74 --> 02:29:15.38
A lot of stuff going on in the head.

2010
02:29:15.38 --> 02:29:20.82
Yeah, undoubtedly, there are tons of benefits

2011
02:29:20.82 --> 02:29:22.58
of those experiences.

2012
02:29:22.58 --> 02:29:25.46
At that time, still a little bit raw.

2013
02:29:25.46 --> 02:29:30.58
I think ultimately we get to post-traumatic growth.

2014
02:29:30.58 --> 02:29:33.86
But before you can get to post-traumatic growth,

2015
02:29:33.86 --> 02:29:35.66
you've got to get to gratitude and you've

2016
02:29:35.66 --> 02:29:39.62
got to find a way to be thankful for that adversity,

2017
02:29:39.62 --> 02:29:40.70
thankful for that hardship.

2018
02:29:40.70 --> 02:29:42.82
You've got to get to your good.

2019
02:29:42.82 --> 02:29:49.94
And initially, when those tough things happen,

2020
02:29:49.94 --> 02:29:54.38
you don't say, oh, I'm so happy that this tough thing happened.

2021
02:29:54.38 --> 02:29:55.86
Whether it's a car accident or cancer,

2022
02:29:55.86 --> 02:29:57.50
you don't say, I'm so happy.

2023
02:29:57.50 --> 02:30:00.82
But the thing happened.

2024
02:30:00.82 --> 02:30:03.02
And so at some point, you can either

2025
02:30:03.02 --> 02:30:05.46
continue to be a victim of that thing

2026
02:30:05.46 --> 02:30:09.58
or you can take your agency back and say good.

2027
02:30:09.58 --> 02:30:12.74
And when you do that, you can say,

2028
02:30:12.74 --> 02:30:14.86
I am thankful for the things that I've

2029
02:30:14.86 --> 02:30:17.18
learned from having this experience.

2030
02:30:17.18 --> 02:30:20.94
And that's why I know many amputees and lots of,

2031
02:30:20.94 --> 02:30:23.38
and this is the cycle.

2032
02:30:23.38 --> 02:30:26.98
Initially, bitter, angry.

2033
02:30:26.98 --> 02:30:29.10
But even the double amputee, triple amputee,

2034
02:30:29.10 --> 02:30:31.66
these guys I know, they'll finally get to a place

2035
02:30:31.66 --> 02:30:35.18
where they say, I wouldn't trade that experience

2036
02:30:35.18 --> 02:30:37.66
because of the things that I've learned and been and fitted

2037
02:30:37.66 --> 02:30:40.70
from and the man that I am today because of that.

2038
02:30:40.70 --> 02:30:43.10
And so you get to gratitude and then you finally

2039
02:30:43.10 --> 02:30:44.30
can get to that growth.

2040
02:30:44.30 --> 02:30:49.94
But undoubtedly, in this moment, I'm still very hurt

2041
02:30:49.94 --> 02:30:51.38
and offended.

2042
02:30:51.38 --> 02:30:52.38
I don't know, offended.

2043
02:30:52.38 --> 02:30:57.26
Again, there was felt like some betrayal, do this thing.

2044
02:30:57.26 --> 02:31:01.26
But then I'd come back in and be like, why are your hands

2045
02:31:01.26 --> 02:31:02.50
bloody?

2046
02:31:02.50 --> 02:31:05.26
Why you got a lot?

2047
02:31:05.26 --> 02:31:08.86
You kind of seems pretty messy out there.

2048
02:31:08.86 --> 02:31:11.42
Yeah, you go out there and tell everybody,

2049
02:31:11.42 --> 02:31:13.18
we go kill these guys, go do this thing.

2050
02:31:13.18 --> 02:31:15.50
And then when the generals come, we're like, hey,

2051
02:31:15.50 --> 02:31:18.06
sledgehammer kills everybody.

2052
02:31:18.06 --> 02:31:20.82
And then you call me in and say, oh,

2053
02:31:20.82 --> 02:31:24.46
well, are you sure that guy had a gun?

2054
02:31:24.46 --> 02:31:27.30
Yes, what are you implying, sir?

2055
02:31:27.30 --> 02:31:33.54
And so it's just carrying too much weight already

2056
02:31:33.54 --> 02:31:37.50
to have, did not feel like your chain of command

2057
02:31:37.50 --> 02:31:39.10
has your back.

2058
02:31:39.10 --> 02:31:42.30
And there were times within the company

2059
02:31:42.30 --> 02:31:44.86
where I felt extremely betrayed.

2060
02:31:44.86 --> 02:31:51.38
And so yeah, I think I was dealing with that.

2061
02:31:51.38 --> 02:31:54.38
Ultimately, though, I think I was

2062
02:31:54.38 --> 02:32:00.14
thankful to have porcelain toilets, California

2063
02:32:00.14 --> 02:32:03.90
burritos, pretty girlfriend.

2064
02:32:03.90 --> 02:32:05.62
San Clemente doesn't suck.

2065
02:32:05.62 --> 02:32:09.78
So a lot of things to be thankful for at that time as well,

2066
02:32:09.78 --> 02:32:12.78
but still trying to figure some things out

2067
02:32:12.78 --> 02:32:15.02
and maybe not doing it that well.

2068
02:32:18.30 --> 02:32:21.82
What was your enlistment status at this point?

2069
02:32:21.82 --> 02:32:22.94
Like, where were you at?

2070
02:32:22.94 --> 02:32:26.02
Did you come back thinking maybe you'll get out?

2071
02:32:26.02 --> 02:32:28.90
Did you come back thinking I'm definitely staying in?

2072
02:32:28.90 --> 02:32:30.54
No, I thought I was going to get out.

2073
02:32:30.54 --> 02:32:36.58
I mean, I didn't have this lifelong desire to serve.

2074
02:32:36.58 --> 02:32:38.14
I didn't grow up as a kid thinking, oh,

2075
02:32:38.14 --> 02:32:39.62
I want to be a soldier someday.

2076
02:32:39.62 --> 02:32:45.26
And I never thought, oh, I want to be a general or a colonel

2077
02:32:45.26 --> 02:32:47.30
or any of this kind of stuff.

2078
02:32:47.30 --> 02:32:49.86
I thought I should do something.

2079
02:32:49.86 --> 02:32:51.66
And then I thought I should be a Marine.

2080
02:32:51.66 --> 02:32:52.98
I thought I should be an infantry Marine.

2081
02:32:52.98 --> 02:32:54.86
And then once I finally figured out, yes,

2082
02:32:54.86 --> 02:32:57.70
I should be an infantry Marine, I thought I should fight.

2083
02:32:57.70 --> 02:32:58.78
And I did that.

2084
02:32:58.78 --> 02:33:01.78
And I got to lead the best men in this nation.

2085
02:33:01.78 --> 02:33:04.82
And so I had met my career goals.

2086
02:33:04.82 --> 02:33:07.94
And then with the amount of crap that I had experienced,

2087
02:33:07.94 --> 02:33:10.34
I said, maybe I'm out.

2088
02:33:10.34 --> 02:33:12.34
And so there's this thing called career designation

2089
02:33:12.34 --> 02:33:13.82
that you're offered as a lieutenant.

2090
02:33:13.82 --> 02:33:14.82
And you've got to accept it.

2091
02:33:14.82 --> 02:33:19.78
And I was not going to designate because I was really

2092
02:33:19.78 --> 02:33:24.66
disenchanted or just disappointed with some

2093
02:33:24.66 --> 02:33:25.78
of that company leadership.

2094
02:33:25.78 --> 02:33:27.90
And so I was going to get out.

2095
02:33:27.90 --> 02:33:31.06
I was serving as an Exo and an adjacent company.

2096
02:33:31.06 --> 02:33:31.54
So from this.

2097
02:33:31.54 --> 02:33:33.06
Is this when you went to Lima Company?

2098
02:33:33.06 --> 02:33:34.54
Yeah.

2099
02:33:34.54 --> 02:33:36.86
You know the frustration that you're talking about,

2100
02:33:36.86 --> 02:33:38.46
with the leadership, right?

2101
02:33:38.46 --> 02:33:39.66
How did you work through that?

2102
02:33:42.58 --> 02:33:46.98
During the deployment, not well.

2103
02:33:46.98 --> 02:33:49.10
I mean, between my company, Gunny,

2104
02:33:49.10 --> 02:33:51.34
who ended up getting medivac'd and Zach,

2105
02:33:51.34 --> 02:33:54.66
I would say there were times where I was on the verge

2106
02:33:54.66 --> 02:33:56.18
of a nervous breakdown.

2107
02:33:56.18 --> 02:33:58.34
It was never the Taliban.

2108
02:33:58.34 --> 02:34:03.54
It was like, I've been training to shoot silhouettes of men

2109
02:34:03.54 --> 02:34:04.62
for years.

2110
02:34:04.62 --> 02:34:06.10
And now I'm shooting.

2111
02:34:06.10 --> 02:34:11.02
And so I am only happy when a Taliban is dead.

2112
02:34:11.02 --> 02:34:13.42
That is no problem.

2113
02:34:13.42 --> 02:34:17.18
And I also am not personally offended that the Taliban is

2114
02:34:17.18 --> 02:34:17.82
shooting at me.

2115
02:34:17.82 --> 02:34:19.74
I know that that's what the Taliban does.

2116
02:34:19.74 --> 02:34:20.70
They shoot at us.

2117
02:34:20.70 --> 02:34:25.14
And so I've been training for that.

2118
02:34:25.14 --> 02:34:26.86
Contact front, contact left.

2119
02:34:26.86 --> 02:34:29.18
I'm training to be shot at.

2120
02:34:29.18 --> 02:34:32.50
And then Marines get wounded.

2121
02:34:32.50 --> 02:34:34.86
Well, why do we have the tourniquets on?

2122
02:34:34.86 --> 02:34:35.86
Why do we do tourniquet drills?

2123
02:34:35.86 --> 02:34:37.90
Why are we doing all these combat lifesaver?

2124
02:34:37.90 --> 02:34:41.94
And it's all these things you expect.

2125
02:34:41.94 --> 02:34:43.86
And if you're paying attention and taking your training

2126
02:34:43.86 --> 02:34:46.14
seriously, you expect that there will be casualties,

2127
02:34:46.14 --> 02:34:48.06
that you will have to kill people, that you will see.

2128
02:34:48.06 --> 02:34:50.58
And so all of that was OK.

2129
02:34:50.58 --> 02:34:53.70
And when you go outside the wire, you're in the yellow.

2130
02:34:53.70 --> 02:34:55.02
You're alert.

2131
02:34:55.02 --> 02:34:56.10
You're scanning your baseline.

2132
02:34:56.10 --> 02:34:57.10
You're waiting for that.

2133
02:34:57.10 --> 02:34:59.54
And so when you're in the yellow and you're alert,

2134
02:34:59.54 --> 02:35:03.34
you can respond to things fluidly, adaptively.

2135
02:35:03.34 --> 02:35:05.70
But you leave the wire at condition one.

2136
02:35:05.70 --> 02:35:08.86
You leave the wire in full PP, flat, gavelar,

2137
02:35:08.86 --> 02:35:11.78
because you know you're going into a hostile environment.

2138
02:35:11.78 --> 02:35:15.22
When you come back inside the wire, condition four,

2139
02:35:15.22 --> 02:35:17.86
take your flak off, because now you're

2140
02:35:17.86 --> 02:35:20.22
within friendly lines.

2141
02:35:20.22 --> 02:35:24.10
And when you get ambushed within friendly lines,

2142
02:35:24.10 --> 02:35:25.62
that's where you're vulnerable.

2143
02:35:25.62 --> 02:35:27.34
And that's when you can really get hurt.

2144
02:35:27.34 --> 02:35:30.78
And those moral injuries, I think, often

2145
02:35:30.78 --> 02:35:36.54
not last the pain associated with physical injuries.

2146
02:35:36.54 --> 02:35:40.78
And so what I did when I got back to the States

2147
02:35:40.78 --> 02:35:42.42
is I just ran.

2148
02:35:42.42 --> 02:35:44.42
I ran and ran and ran.

2149
02:35:44.42 --> 02:35:47.38
And those fire breaks outside Camp Pellenton,

2150
02:35:47.38 --> 02:35:51.70
every morning I would just go run for as long as I could,

2151
02:35:51.70 --> 02:35:53.86
for as far as I could.

2152
02:35:53.86 --> 02:35:56.98
And then I would just pour myself into my work,

2153
02:35:56.98 --> 02:36:01.10
as I was dealing with things.

2154
02:36:01.10 --> 02:36:05.06
How did you come to the conclusion that you would stay in?

2155
02:36:05.06 --> 02:36:06.30
I had a new boss.

2156
02:36:06.30 --> 02:36:10.02
And the new Lima Company commander came in.

2157
02:36:10.02 --> 02:36:12.58
He's my current boss.

2158
02:36:12.58 --> 02:36:16.82
And he was everything I'd hoped for.

2159
02:36:16.82 --> 02:36:20.50
He was IOC instructors, had such high standards.

2160
02:36:20.50 --> 02:36:21.62
And they were so challenging.

2161
02:36:21.62 --> 02:36:23.22
They were so good.

2162
02:36:23.22 --> 02:36:26.82
And I was like, man, a Marine captain, that's something.

2163
02:36:26.82 --> 02:36:28.06
That is a Marine captain.

2164
02:36:28.06 --> 02:36:29.10
That is really something.

2165
02:36:29.10 --> 02:36:34.06
And then I found myself disappointed throughout my work

2166
02:36:34.06 --> 02:36:37.26
up and deployment and disillusioned.

2167
02:36:37.26 --> 02:36:41.14
And then this, and so I'm thinking I'm out.

2168
02:36:41.14 --> 02:36:44.02
I'll go back to Chicago, going to be a fireman,

2169
02:36:44.02 --> 02:36:46.82
took the fireman test.

2170
02:36:46.82 --> 02:36:49.22
Then this guy came in.

2171
02:36:49.22 --> 02:36:51.42
And we want to be Marines because we

2172
02:36:51.42 --> 02:36:52.46
want to do hard shit.

2173
02:36:52.46 --> 02:36:54.42
We want to be challenged.

2174
02:36:54.42 --> 02:36:56.70
I wanted to be a Marine because they had higher standards.

2175
02:36:56.70 --> 02:36:58.50
I looked at them and thought it's high standards.

2176
02:36:58.50 --> 02:36:59.74
That's what I want.

2177
02:36:59.74 --> 02:37:02.42
And this guy came in and he emulated all those high

2178
02:37:02.42 --> 02:37:02.94
standards.

2179
02:37:02.94 --> 02:37:05.38
And every day, I had to be at the top of my game.

2180
02:37:05.38 --> 02:37:07.54
Every day, I had to get better.

2181
02:37:07.54 --> 02:37:09.50
And that's all I want.

2182
02:37:09.50 --> 02:37:14.18
A leader who emulated what he espoused,

2183
02:37:14.18 --> 02:37:18.26
a leader who was accountable and who held me accountable.

2184
02:37:18.26 --> 02:37:23.50
As a lieutenant, I had very little oversight, which

2185
02:37:23.50 --> 02:37:24.82
in some ways was awesome.

2186
02:37:24.82 --> 02:37:27.10
Because I just got to go running gun all the time out

2187
02:37:27.10 --> 02:37:28.26
and doing my thing.

2188
02:37:28.26 --> 02:37:29.90
But I needed somebody to mentor me.

2189
02:37:29.90 --> 02:37:31.66
I needed someone to hold me more accountable.

2190
02:37:31.66 --> 02:37:35.58
I needed someone to develop me and coach me and teach me.

2191
02:37:35.58 --> 02:37:36.62
And he did those things.

2192
02:37:36.62 --> 02:37:42.14
And I said, OK, well, I want to do this, what he's doing

2193
02:37:42.14 --> 02:37:42.94
for somebody someday.

2194
02:37:42.94 --> 02:37:44.82
And so I said, I'm going to stay in.

2195
02:37:44.82 --> 02:37:49.42
But as we grinded towards the Mew,

2196
02:37:49.42 --> 02:37:51.82
I saw a flyer at the gym that said,

2197
02:37:51.82 --> 02:37:55.02
do you have what it takes, come try out for recon.

2198
02:37:55.02 --> 02:37:58.18
And I said, yeah, maybe this XO staff life isn't for me.

2199
02:37:58.18 --> 02:38:01.14
I'm going to try to go fight again with some troops.

2200
02:38:01.14 --> 02:38:07.46
Yeah, I guess no matter what industry you're in,

2201
02:38:07.46 --> 02:38:14.06
whether you're in the Marine Corps, Army, IBM,

2202
02:38:14.06 --> 02:38:16.02
you name the company, you're going

2203
02:38:16.02 --> 02:38:17.82
to have some good bosses.

2204
02:38:17.82 --> 02:38:19.50
You're going to have some bad bosses.

2205
02:38:19.50 --> 02:38:22.38
And a lot of it has to do with what I was talking about

2206
02:38:22.38 --> 02:38:24.70
earlier, like if you're not doing your best

2207
02:38:24.70 --> 02:38:27.22
to understand the perspective of the person above you

2208
02:38:27.22 --> 02:38:30.10
and the chain of command, it's going to be hard.

2209
02:38:30.10 --> 02:38:31.02
And here's the thing.

2210
02:38:31.02 --> 02:38:34.42
There's at least a 50% chance that they're not

2211
02:38:34.42 --> 02:38:36.14
trying to understand your perspective at all.

2212
02:38:36.14 --> 02:38:38.30
There's a 50% chance that they just

2213
02:38:38.30 --> 02:38:41.98
think you should just be conforming to what I'm telling

2214
02:38:41.98 --> 02:38:44.38
you and complying with what I tell you.

2215
02:38:44.38 --> 02:38:46.94
There's a 50% chance you got a boss like that.

2216
02:38:46.94 --> 02:38:50.38
And in that case, you can sit there and be mad like,

2217
02:38:50.38 --> 02:38:51.78
why don't they understand?

2218
02:38:51.78 --> 02:38:53.54
Or you can say, OK, I got to work with this.

2219
02:38:53.54 --> 02:38:57.06
I got to make sure I do my best to make them understand.

2220
02:38:57.06 --> 02:38:59.02
I got to paint a better picture.

2221
02:38:59.02 --> 02:39:01.06
I've got to do a better job.

2222
02:39:01.06 --> 02:39:03.54
And again, it goes back to that gives you

2223
02:39:03.54 --> 02:39:08.66
some kind of agency over your life to think, OK,

2224
02:39:08.66 --> 02:39:10.42
my boss is an egomaniac.

2225
02:39:10.42 --> 02:39:11.86
My boss has a bad temper.

2226
02:39:11.86 --> 02:39:15.06
My boss doesn't understand my perspective.

2227
02:39:15.06 --> 02:39:17.90
My boss is looking to get promoted,

2228
02:39:17.90 --> 02:39:19.22
and that's the main thing he's felt.

2229
02:39:19.22 --> 02:39:21.50
Like all those things, all those horrible things.

2230
02:39:21.50 --> 02:39:23.46
And we all work for people like that.

2231
02:39:23.46 --> 02:39:24.50
And you go, OK, cool.

2232
02:39:24.50 --> 02:39:25.38
That's what my boss is like.

2233
02:39:25.38 --> 02:39:26.74
All right, here's what I'm going to do.

2234
02:39:26.74 --> 02:39:28.94
Here's how I'm going to build a relationship with my boss.

2235
02:39:28.94 --> 02:39:30.62
Here's how I'm going to build trust with my boss,

2236
02:39:30.62 --> 02:39:32.58
regardless of what their situation is.

2237
02:39:32.58 --> 02:39:35.38
So I'm just saying, I like the fact

2238
02:39:35.38 --> 02:39:39.90
that you were able to get to a point where you say, OK,

2239
02:39:39.90 --> 02:39:40.74
there's good bosses.

2240
02:39:40.74 --> 02:39:42.74
There's bad bosses out there.

2241
02:39:42.74 --> 02:39:43.86
Of course, everybody.

2242
02:39:43.86 --> 02:39:45.38
Try and be a good boss.

2243
02:39:45.38 --> 02:39:46.94
Try and support the people in the field.

2244
02:39:46.94 --> 02:39:48.34
That's 100% it.

2245
02:39:48.34 --> 02:39:52.18
But when you're a subordinate and your boss is maybe not

2246
02:39:52.18 --> 02:39:55.34
quite what you dreamed of, good challenge.

2247
02:39:55.34 --> 02:39:57.62
Build a good relationship with them.

2248
02:39:57.62 --> 02:40:00.94
And things are going to get better.

2249
02:40:00.94 --> 02:40:03.86
That's the way it works.

2250
02:40:03.86 --> 02:40:06.74
In the meantime, you get married, right?

2251
02:40:06.74 --> 02:40:08.74
You make that decision.

2252
02:40:08.74 --> 02:40:11.06
You finally say, all right, I'm going to do this.

2253
02:40:11.06 --> 02:40:14.06
Is that before you screened for recon?

2254
02:40:14.06 --> 02:40:15.18
It was before I screened.

2255
02:40:15.18 --> 02:40:16.74
It was right when I got back.

2256
02:40:16.74 --> 02:40:17.98
Right when you got back?

2257
02:40:17.98 --> 02:40:18.54
You closed the deal.

2258
02:40:18.54 --> 02:40:19.42
Court wedding.

2259
02:40:19.42 --> 02:40:20.54
Yeah.

2260
02:40:20.54 --> 02:40:23.50
She put up with me dumping her right before I left.

2261
02:40:23.50 --> 02:40:25.94
And then all my sad phone calls, and I never get the sad phone.

2262
02:40:25.94 --> 02:40:28.02
I said, you better go do the right thing.

2263
02:40:28.02 --> 02:40:30.90
And so I did a court wedding a couple of weeks

2264
02:40:30.90 --> 02:40:32.06
after I got back.

2265
02:40:32.06 --> 02:40:33.90
And then you go to recon.

2266
02:40:33.90 --> 02:40:36.42
And you got some cool, you had an interesting day

2267
02:40:36.42 --> 02:40:40.66
of getting selected for recon, which was actually

2268
02:40:40.66 --> 02:40:41.46
a pretty cool story.

2269
02:40:41.46 --> 02:40:42.42
We won't go into it now.

2270
02:40:42.42 --> 02:40:44.74
People can read the book for that one.

2271
02:40:44.74 --> 02:40:47.54
But you end up getting selected for recon.

2272
02:40:47.54 --> 02:40:49.02
But do I have this right?

2273
02:40:49.02 --> 02:40:52.42
Instead of going to reconnaissance school,

2274
02:40:52.42 --> 02:40:55.98
they have recon on deployment or going on deployment quickly.

2275
02:40:55.98 --> 02:40:57.70
And they say, hey, you're not going to recon school.

2276
02:40:57.70 --> 02:40:59.42
You're going to go be an advisor.

2277
02:40:59.42 --> 02:41:01.46
So the battalion was deployed.

2278
02:41:01.46 --> 02:41:03.22
So when I showed up, the battalion was deployed.

2279
02:41:03.22 --> 02:41:06.30
I'm the one guy back, a couple guys back.

2280
02:41:06.30 --> 02:41:08.70
And I was supposed to go to school.

2281
02:41:08.70 --> 02:41:11.10
And then it's called an IA, and an individual augment

2282
02:41:11.10 --> 02:41:11.66
came down.

2283
02:41:11.66 --> 02:41:14.66
And they said, hey, we need one dude

2284
02:41:14.66 --> 02:41:18.34
to go advise the Afghan on how to be recon.

2285
02:41:18.34 --> 02:41:19.70
You're all we got.

2286
02:41:19.70 --> 02:41:21.14
Even though you haven't been to school,

2287
02:41:21.14 --> 02:41:23.82
you're going to go advise these guys how to be.

2288
02:41:23.82 --> 02:41:25.58
And so I joined an advisor team that

2289
02:41:25.58 --> 02:41:28.98
was mostly guys, senior officers who

2290
02:41:28.98 --> 02:41:33.94
were going to advise a brigade level, so like staff stuff.

2291
02:41:33.94 --> 02:41:36.86
And me and a recon staff sergeant

2292
02:41:36.86 --> 02:41:41.02
were going to go out and advise the Afghan recon company.

2293
02:41:41.02 --> 02:41:44.54
So you've been back home for how long at this point?

2294
02:41:44.54 --> 02:41:47.70
I was home probably for about five or six months

2295
02:41:47.70 --> 02:41:50.34
when I got the word that I was going

2296
02:41:50.34 --> 02:41:52.30
to get the individual augment.

2297
02:41:52.30 --> 02:41:56.62
And then July 2012, you go back to Afghanistan.

2298
02:41:56.62 --> 02:41:58.94
You're out at patrol base Long Beach.

2299
02:41:58.94 --> 02:42:00.46
What was that setup like?

2300
02:42:00.46 --> 02:42:01.94
It was an old artillery firing position.

2301
02:42:01.94 --> 02:42:05.34
It was just a triangle, tiny, tiny little firing base

2302
02:42:05.34 --> 02:42:07.42
outside of Marja.

2303
02:42:07.42 --> 02:42:09.34
And it was July.

2304
02:42:09.34 --> 02:42:13.26
And the human factors, like the human factors

2305
02:42:13.26 --> 02:42:16.18
of the first deployment was the losing the guys

2306
02:42:16.18 --> 02:42:18.86
and the fighting and the grinding every day.

2307
02:42:18.86 --> 02:42:22.58
This was, I mean, not that I had any amenities really

2308
02:42:22.58 --> 02:42:24.82
on that first deployment, but this deployment,

2309
02:42:24.82 --> 02:42:27.50
I mean, it was a cot, a camionette, a pallet of water,

2310
02:42:27.50 --> 02:42:28.98
and a pallet of MREs.

2311
02:42:28.98 --> 02:42:29.86
And that's it.

2312
02:42:29.86 --> 02:42:32.02
And I was living with the ANA.

2313
02:42:32.02 --> 02:42:34.98
Right downwind from the shitter.

2314
02:42:34.98 --> 02:42:38.46
It was like the plagues of Moses coming through that place,

2315
02:42:38.46 --> 02:42:42.58
like bugs coming through and waves blocking out the sun.

2316
02:42:42.58 --> 02:42:47.58
I mean, it was hard, hard living out there in July.

2317
02:42:48.26 --> 02:42:50.58
And then, yeah, I'm going out, I'm fighting with the ANA

2318
02:42:50.58 --> 02:42:52.30
and then I'm a JTAC.

2319
02:42:52.30 --> 02:42:54.50
So I'm like a freelance JTAC.

2320
02:42:54.50 --> 02:42:58.06
So anybody who needs the guy for an op, they're calling me

2321
02:42:58.06 --> 02:43:00.38
and I'm getting to go on some pretty cool ops.

2322
02:43:00.38 --> 02:43:02.34
How many ANA are you out there with?

2323
02:43:02.34 --> 02:43:04.10
About 50.

2324
02:43:04.10 --> 02:43:07.14
So it's you, how many American advisors?

2325
02:43:07.14 --> 02:43:09.14
The one other Staff Sergeant counterpart

2326
02:43:09.14 --> 02:43:11.90
and then we'd pull like four or five grunts

2327
02:43:11.90 --> 02:43:15.58
from the AEO who would kind of help stand security.

2328
02:43:17.38 --> 02:43:18.30
So it was very lonely.

2329
02:43:18.30 --> 02:43:20.98
So this is a totally different kind of deployment.

2330
02:43:20.98 --> 02:43:23.22
Again, the disparity of different types of deployment

2331
02:43:23.22 --> 02:43:24.90
you can go on is insane.

2332
02:43:24.90 --> 02:43:27.42
For you to be out in the middle of nowhere now

2333
02:43:27.42 --> 02:43:30.02
with a bunch of freaking Afghans.

2334
02:43:30.02 --> 02:43:33.36
God.

2335
02:43:34.66 --> 02:43:37.78
Did you, so was your mission just to train these guys up?

2336
02:43:37.78 --> 02:43:41.86
Yeah, train the Afghan and partner, advise, assist

2337
02:43:41.86 --> 02:43:44.06
and then go out with them on operations.

2338
02:43:44.06 --> 02:43:46.14
And yeah, it was, but I mean, at this point

2339
02:43:46.14 --> 02:43:48.86
those guys have been trained for a really long time.

2340
02:43:48.86 --> 02:43:53.18
So I mean, really I'm just kind of talking to their leadership

2341
02:43:53.18 --> 02:43:55.50
and then going out on operations with them.

2342
02:43:55.50 --> 02:43:56.50
What's the op-temple like?

2343
02:43:56.50 --> 02:43:57.66
How often are you guys going out?

2344
02:43:57.66 --> 02:43:59.18
We're going out every day,

2345
02:43:59.18 --> 02:44:01.26
but it's not reconnaissance type missions.

2346
02:44:01.26 --> 02:44:03.94
It's like they're just basically better infantrymen

2347
02:44:03.94 --> 02:44:05.66
than your average Afghan soldier.

2348
02:44:05.66 --> 02:44:10.90
And so, but we really patrolled from like two a.m. to six a.m.

2349
02:44:10.90 --> 02:44:13.34
because by, you know, when the sun came up

2350
02:44:13.34 --> 02:44:14.70
it was over a hundred degrees.

2351
02:44:14.70 --> 02:44:15.82
And so for the first couple of months

2352
02:44:15.82 --> 02:44:18.50
it was just real early morning patrols,

2353
02:44:18.50 --> 02:44:21.74
not too kinetic with those guys.

2354
02:44:21.74 --> 02:44:24.62
But again, a company going out would say,

2355
02:44:24.62 --> 02:44:27.54
oh, we can have a JTAC just jump on this op.

2356
02:44:27.54 --> 02:44:29.06
And so when I was jumping on these ops

2357
02:44:29.06 --> 02:44:30.34
with the different Marine companies

2358
02:44:30.34 --> 02:44:33.18
we were getting it really getting into it.

2359
02:44:33.18 --> 02:44:36.58
Freelance JTAC in Afghanistan.

2360
02:44:36.58 --> 02:44:38.94
What'd you take away from a leadership perspective

2361
02:44:38.94 --> 02:44:40.86
on this deployment?

2362
02:44:40.86 --> 02:44:44.54
Leadership is lonely, which I've kind of already knew,

2363
02:44:44.54 --> 02:44:48.26
but it was particularly lonely when it's, you know,

2364
02:44:48.26 --> 02:44:50.26
couple of Lance Corporals

2365
02:44:50.26 --> 02:44:52.26
are the only other Americans around.

2366
02:44:52.26 --> 02:44:56.58
And so you could only talk about the things

2367
02:44:56.58 --> 02:44:59.66
that Lance Corporals talk about for so long.

2368
02:44:59.66 --> 02:45:04.66
And so that was really a lot of time to think by myself.

2369
02:45:09.66 --> 02:45:11.74
One of the things that I'm advising these guys

2370
02:45:11.74 --> 02:45:14.34
and one of them turns me and says,

2371
02:45:14.34 --> 02:45:16.50
well, you know when you leave is the Taliban

2372
02:45:16.50 --> 02:45:19.14
is just gonna take Afghanistan back anyways.

2373
02:45:19.14 --> 02:45:21.50
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

2374
02:45:21.50 --> 02:45:22.66
You got a whole army.

2375
02:45:22.66 --> 02:45:24.18
You got 10 years of training.

2376
02:45:24.18 --> 02:45:28.26
You got millions and I was like,

2377
02:45:28.26 --> 02:45:33.26
I want Afghanistan more than you want Afghanistan.

2378
02:45:33.26 --> 02:45:35.58
And it was a really important lesson for me

2379
02:45:35.58 --> 02:45:37.98
that you can't want something more for someone

2380
02:45:37.98 --> 02:45:39.18
than they want it for themselves.

2381
02:45:39.18 --> 02:45:43.42
And that applies to many different areas of life.

2382
02:45:43.42 --> 02:45:47.38
And so that was kind of hard to accept.

2383
02:45:47.38 --> 02:45:52.38
And I found that I am happiest when I'm under fire.

2384
02:45:55.22 --> 02:46:00.22
And like when you have a purpose

2385
02:46:00.88 --> 02:46:04.74
and that is being a warrior or combat leader

2386
02:46:04.74 --> 02:46:07.10
and you're good at that thing,

2387
02:46:07.10 --> 02:46:10.86
there is nothing more rewarding or satisfying

2388
02:46:10.86 --> 02:46:11.98
than when you get to,

2389
02:46:11.98 --> 02:46:14.78
and so got right back in the game

2390
02:46:14.78 --> 02:46:16.42
and right back in my first firefight,

2391
02:46:16.42 --> 02:46:18.26
I'm like, okay, here's what I don't do.

2392
02:46:18.26 --> 02:46:20.26
Like you're gonna do this, you're gonna do that.

2393
02:46:20.26 --> 02:46:24.90
And so, and then I was an enabler.

2394
02:46:24.90 --> 02:46:27.70
And that was a weird role for me

2395
02:46:27.70 --> 02:46:29.82
because I used to be in a commander.

2396
02:46:29.82 --> 02:46:31.50
And so when I'm the JTAC,

2397
02:46:31.50 --> 02:46:34.10
I don't have command of anybody.

2398
02:46:34.10 --> 02:46:36.02
I'm just there to support a commander.

2399
02:46:36.02 --> 02:46:39.90
And so it's tough because you see like,

2400
02:46:39.90 --> 02:46:42.50
here's what we need should be doing,

2401
02:46:42.50 --> 02:46:43.78
but like that's not your role.

2402
02:46:43.78 --> 02:46:47.30
So like staying in my role as an enabler

2403
02:46:47.30 --> 02:46:49.62
was different for me.

2404
02:46:49.62 --> 02:46:53.30
And so I got to appreciate maybe that role a little bit.

2405
02:46:56.94 --> 02:46:59.62
You get orders, go back to Pendleton.

2406
02:46:59.62 --> 02:47:01.70
It's now March, 2013.

2407
02:47:03.22 --> 02:47:07.54
When you get home, it's safe to say at this juncture,

2408
02:47:07.54 --> 02:47:12.18
your work-life balance was not in balance at all.

2409
02:47:12.18 --> 02:47:13.78
No, I just only did Marine stuff.

2410
02:47:15.62 --> 02:47:19.66
Andrea at this point, she had moved back to Chicago.

2411
02:47:19.66 --> 02:47:20.50
Yeah.

2412
02:47:22.70 --> 02:47:25.78
One of your buddies pulls you aside and is like,

2413
02:47:27.30 --> 02:47:29.14
do you want the Marine Corps or do you want marriage?

2414
02:47:29.14 --> 02:47:31.02
Like which one of these two things did you want?

2415
02:47:31.02 --> 02:47:33.58
Because they're mutually exclusive.

2416
02:47:33.58 --> 02:47:36.18
Like it doesn't sound like you'd be able to do both.

2417
02:47:37.90 --> 02:47:40.38
You decide marriage.

2418
02:47:40.38 --> 02:47:41.94
That's the thing you're gonna work towards.

2419
02:47:41.94 --> 02:47:44.42
And you tell your wife, I'll get out of the Marine Corps.

2420
02:47:44.42 --> 02:47:46.22
We can go home, we'll figure it out.

2421
02:47:48.02 --> 02:47:51.70
She says, nope, not it.

2422
02:47:51.70 --> 02:47:53.26
I still don't wanna be with you.

2423
02:47:55.46 --> 02:47:57.78
So this is a rough, this is rough.

2424
02:47:57.78 --> 02:48:00.14
Eventually you get her to come back.

2425
02:48:01.22 --> 02:48:03.94
She comes back out, back out here.

2426
02:48:03.94 --> 02:48:04.78
Yep.

2427
02:48:07.62 --> 02:48:10.90
Doesn't end up being, once again,

2428
02:48:10.90 --> 02:48:14.70
still not where it needs to be with her.

2429
02:48:14.70 --> 02:48:19.70
And you eventually find out that she'd been unfaithful to you

2430
02:48:20.58 --> 02:48:21.98
while you were on deployment.

2431
02:48:23.70 --> 02:48:26.34
With one of your fellow Marines.

2432
02:48:26.34 --> 02:48:31.34
With a Marine that live with you.

2433
02:48:31.34 --> 02:48:32.18
I'm not sure.

2434
02:48:40.30 --> 02:48:41.78
How do you get through that?

2435
02:48:43.66 --> 02:48:47.54
So I talk about ambushes, that life is full of ambushes.

2436
02:48:47.54 --> 02:48:52.54
And sometimes combat veterans will try to say like,

2437
02:48:53.62 --> 02:48:57.26
oh well, I was in an ambush with bullets and bombs.

2438
02:48:57.26 --> 02:49:01.10
And so you can, and I'll tell you that my worst ambush

2439
02:49:01.10 --> 02:49:03.54
was that was my worst ambush in my life.

2440
02:49:06.66 --> 02:49:09.14
So I try not to establish higher,

2441
02:49:09.14 --> 02:49:10.50
like everyone's trying to compete

2442
02:49:10.50 --> 02:49:12.30
and who had the worst or who,

2443
02:49:12.30 --> 02:49:15.86
and so combat veterans think that we have this,

2444
02:49:15.86 --> 02:49:19.50
or veterans in general think that we have this special kind of,

2445
02:49:19.50 --> 02:49:21.98
people should feel bad for us because we did this.

2446
02:49:21.98 --> 02:49:24.70
First off, I volunteered for those things.

2447
02:49:24.70 --> 02:49:25.66
I wanted those things.

2448
02:49:25.66 --> 02:49:26.62
I sought those things.

2449
02:49:26.62 --> 02:49:27.94
No one made me do that.

2450
02:49:27.94 --> 02:49:31.94
I was trained and prepared for those things.

2451
02:49:31.94 --> 02:49:35.58
I wasn't trained or prepared for that.

2452
02:49:39.70 --> 02:49:43.70
And that was a moral injury that took a long time,

2453
02:49:47.26 --> 02:49:51.46
and maybe still presently one that you heal from.

2454
02:49:51.46 --> 02:49:56.46
And much of my motivation in life is a response not to repeat

2455
02:50:00.06 --> 02:50:03.66
the same mistakes that I experienced when I was growing up.

2456
02:50:03.66 --> 02:50:05.70
And one of those was divorce.

2457
02:50:05.70 --> 02:50:07.02
And so I thought, no matter what,

2458
02:50:07.02 --> 02:50:08.64
I'm not gonna get divorced.

2459
02:50:08.64 --> 02:50:18.64
But at that point, I thought, yeah, this is over, and I wanted to make it very clear that ultimately,

2460
02:50:18.64 --> 02:50:25.64
that those actions from my wife are not representative of who she is as a woman,

2461
02:50:25.64 --> 02:50:31.64
and that she has been the greatest blessing of my life outside of my savior.

2462
02:50:31.64 --> 02:50:35.16
And so I wouldn't be here today without her.

2463
02:50:35.16 --> 02:50:37.28
I wouldn't be here without her.

2464
02:50:37.28 --> 02:50:39.52
I wouldn't be here without her.

2465
02:50:39.52 --> 02:50:41.64
I wouldn't be here without her.

2466
02:50:41.64 --> 02:50:43.52
I wouldn't be here without her.

2467
02:50:43.52 --> 02:50:45.76
I wouldn't be here without her.

2468
02:50:45.76 --> 02:50:50.72
I wouldn't be here today without her, but I was hurt.

2469
02:50:50.72 --> 02:50:53.12
I was angry.

2470
02:50:53.12 --> 02:50:55.44
I lost my mind a little bit.

2471
02:50:55.44 --> 02:50:59.52
I went crazy.

2472
02:50:59.52 --> 02:51:02.92
Not like crazy yelling or screaming,

2473
02:51:02.92 --> 02:51:12.16
but just kind of went on a bender of doing unhealthy shit for a long time.

2474
02:51:12.16 --> 02:51:23.60
But through it all, I dated and did whatever, but they're always inside me.

2475
02:51:23.60 --> 02:51:29.24
I was so happily married, and I was so much looking forward to starting a family.

2476
02:51:29.24 --> 02:51:32.80
And there was no one else that I wanted to be the mother of my children.

2477
02:51:32.80 --> 02:51:35.28
There was no one else that I wanted to grow old with.

2478
02:51:35.28 --> 02:51:38.56
There was no one else I wanted to do life with more than her.

2479
02:51:38.56 --> 02:51:44.24
And so even though I met some great people on the way and had a lot of fun along the way,

2480
02:51:44.24 --> 02:51:47.96
at the end of the day, I'd always come back to thinking about her.

2481
02:51:47.96 --> 02:51:53.08
And so I kept trying to stuff other stuff into that.

2482
02:51:53.08 --> 02:52:00.60
And then finally I said, maybe you stop trying to force.

2483
02:52:00.60 --> 02:52:06.60
And so she had been so forgiving with me and so graceful with me and so merciful with me.

2484
02:52:06.60 --> 02:52:10.88
I have gone wayward many, many times.

2485
02:52:10.88 --> 02:52:20.72
And yeah, I'd finally call there and I said, yeah, let's try this again.

2486
02:52:20.72 --> 02:52:25.96
Which was probably the best decision I ever made because now I've got the most beautiful,

2487
02:52:25.96 --> 02:52:29.68
loyal, devoted wife and most phenomenal mother to my three children.

2488
02:52:29.68 --> 02:52:32.32
And so I messed a lot of things up in life.

2489
02:52:32.32 --> 02:52:39.56
I think doing a re-attack on that was, it leads to some really interesting conversations

2490
02:52:39.56 --> 02:52:43.04
at IPEC.

2491
02:52:43.04 --> 02:52:46.68
When you go to the S1 or the admin and they're doing your S1 audit, they say, do you ever

2492
02:52:46.68 --> 02:52:47.68
get divorced?

2493
02:52:47.68 --> 02:52:48.68
And I'm like, yes.

2494
02:52:48.68 --> 02:52:50.60
And they're like, OK, who's like, who do you divorce?

2495
02:52:50.60 --> 02:52:52.52
And then like, are you remarried?

2496
02:52:52.52 --> 02:52:53.52
I'm like, yes.

2497
02:52:53.52 --> 02:52:54.68
And they're like, OK, who's in it?

2498
02:52:54.68 --> 02:52:55.68
And there's all this-

2499
02:52:55.68 --> 02:52:56.68
Copy and paste.

2500
02:52:56.68 --> 02:53:01.92
There's Lance Corporal's like, oh my god, just keep pushing Lance Corporal.

2501
02:53:01.92 --> 02:53:02.92
Keep pushing.

2502
02:53:02.92 --> 02:53:08.44
Yeah, no, I mean, again, I'm only reading a small part of this book and you give a lot

2503
02:53:08.44 --> 02:53:15.56
more background on the whole situation on, you take ownership, a lot of your behavior.

2504
02:53:15.56 --> 02:53:20.92
And I think that's, you can kind of, as I read the story, I was like, yeah, well, that's

2505
02:53:20.92 --> 02:53:23.32
to be, you can see it.

2506
02:53:23.32 --> 02:53:29.36
And then even the reconciliation, you can see it as it's being put together that you

2507
02:53:29.36 --> 02:53:33.28
had to square your shit away.

2508
02:53:33.28 --> 02:53:38.60
And that's what was able to allow this to happen.

2509
02:53:38.60 --> 02:53:44.60
But again, I think it's just like, man, I mean, the SEAL team has like a 90% divorce rate.

2510
02:53:44.60 --> 02:53:47.08
It's insane because of all this stuff.

2511
02:53:47.08 --> 02:53:48.08
You're gone.

2512
02:53:48.08 --> 02:53:49.08
You're, it's just mayhem.

2513
02:53:49.08 --> 02:53:55.52
I don't know what it is in the military at large, but it's really freaking hard on relationships.

2514
02:53:55.52 --> 02:53:57.12
Really freaking hard on relationships.

2515
02:53:57.12 --> 02:54:01.68
So I think it's just the way that you spell this stuff out.

2516
02:54:01.68 --> 02:54:03.20
You talk about it is really important.

2517
02:54:03.20 --> 02:54:07.72
It's going to help a lot of people when they're going through this kind of thing.

2518
02:54:07.72 --> 02:54:12.56
So appreciate you putting it in there.

2519
02:54:12.56 --> 02:54:18.48
2014, winner, you're assigned to the School of Infantry.

2520
02:54:18.48 --> 02:54:22.84
You're going to, you become the director of combat instructor school.

2521
02:54:22.84 --> 02:54:25.000
So what does that exactly mean?

2522
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:29.96
So the School of Infantry is where all the privates come after they go to boot camp.

2523
02:54:29.96 --> 02:54:34.000
And so if you're going to be a non-infantry Marine, you go to a course called MCT where

2524
02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:37.48
you get like six weeks of basic infantry stuff or four weeks of basic.

2525
02:54:37.48 --> 02:54:42.52
And then if you're going to be an infantry, you get three months of your basic, your rifleman,

2526
02:54:42.52 --> 02:54:44.36
machine gunner, mortarman.

2527
02:54:44.36 --> 02:54:47.68
And so, and then from there, you go out to your unit.

2528
02:54:47.68 --> 02:54:53.84
And so that the combat instructors are the ones that receive those privates and PFCs and

2529
02:54:53.84 --> 02:54:56.52
train them in their craft.

2530
02:54:56.52 --> 02:54:58.56
It's also where we have all the advanced infantry schools.

2531
02:54:58.56 --> 02:55:01.64
So if you come back as a squad leader to go to the advanced squad leader, advanced machine

2532
02:55:01.64 --> 02:55:06.56
gunner, the combat instructors are the ones bringing the squad leaders in and teaching

2533
02:55:06.56 --> 02:55:07.84
them the advanced tactics.

2534
02:55:07.84 --> 02:55:14.12
And so, but before you can be an instructor there, you've got to go through a course,

2535
02:55:14.12 --> 02:55:17.84
combat instructor school, and then you go out and you train the privates or you train

2536
02:55:17.84 --> 02:55:18.84
the sergeants.

2537
02:55:18.84 --> 02:55:25.16
So I was the director of that school, which was just a phenomenal position working with

2538
02:55:25.16 --> 02:55:29.92
the highest caliber sergeants and staff sergeants in the entire Marine Corps.

2539
02:55:29.92 --> 02:55:36.92
And it was really, really refreshing and good for my soul to be around 20 to 25 dudes who

2540
02:55:36.92 --> 02:55:40.76
are at the top of their game every day and just doing grunt and shit.

2541
02:55:40.76 --> 02:55:42.04
It was a great time.

2542
02:55:42.04 --> 02:55:43.96
And were you teaching as well?

2543
02:55:43.96 --> 02:55:48.80
I did a little bit of the platform instruction, but I was more like the principal.

2544
02:55:48.80 --> 02:55:52.60
And mine, I had combat instructors who taught combat instructor school.

2545
02:55:52.60 --> 02:55:55.28
And so, you know, hike with them, go out on the range.

2546
02:55:55.28 --> 02:55:56.28
Oh, I see the range.

2547
02:55:56.28 --> 02:55:58.32
Do a little class here and there.

2548
02:55:58.32 --> 02:56:02.88
But generally, my instructors did the bulk of the teaching.

2549
02:56:02.88 --> 02:56:06.000
I always feel like you learn so much when you're an instructor role.

2550
02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.44
And I was very, very, very lucky to have been in that role quite a few times.

2551
02:56:10.44 --> 02:56:11.96
I was an E five, man.

2552
02:56:11.96 --> 02:56:14.96
I was an E five teaching immediate action drills.

2553
02:56:14.96 --> 02:56:16.76
And you've learned so much, man.

2554
02:56:16.76 --> 02:56:17.76
You're detached.

2555
02:56:17.76 --> 02:56:18.76
You're watching it happen.

2556
02:56:18.76 --> 02:56:22.12
You see that officer that's looking down his gun instead of looking around you.

2557
02:56:22.12 --> 02:56:23.12
Like, Hey, what are you doing?

2558
02:56:23.12 --> 02:56:26.28
And by the time you're in that by the time I was out in position, like, it was frigging

2559
02:56:26.28 --> 02:56:31.40
awesome to have been through that from a detached perspective because you're watching it over

2560
02:56:31.40 --> 02:56:33.32
and over again.

2561
02:56:33.32 --> 02:56:35.36
So you're doing that.

2562
02:56:35.36 --> 02:56:38.56
Meanwhile, Zack is carrying on, by the way.

2563
02:56:38.56 --> 02:56:40.76
And again, I'm, I'm, Zack's not here.

2564
02:56:40.76 --> 02:56:46.20
We're, we're, we're not reading much of his story, but he's, he got married.

2565
02:56:46.20 --> 02:56:47.72
He married a woman named D. Wa.

2566
02:56:47.72 --> 02:56:48.72
Is that right?

2567
02:56:48.72 --> 02:56:49.72
D. Wa.

2568
02:56:49.72 --> 02:56:54.04
They're having kids.

2569
02:56:54.04 --> 02:56:57.56
He graduates from a school.

2570
02:56:57.56 --> 02:57:01.36
Of course, the Taliban still gained in power.

2571
02:57:01.36 --> 02:57:02.72
And that's not good for him.

2572
02:57:02.72 --> 02:57:04.16
Not good for his family.

2573
02:57:04.16 --> 02:57:10.16
2016, they're, they're receiving nightletters, which are just straight up death threats from

2574
02:57:10.16 --> 02:57:16.44
the Taliban, Taliban to kill him, to hurt his family, kill his family, anyone that helped

2575
02:57:16.44 --> 02:57:17.44
America.

2576
02:57:17.44 --> 02:57:20.68
A nightmare for him.

2577
02:57:20.68 --> 02:57:26.64
He decides to apply for the special immigrant visa program.

2578
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:30.80
That's a long process, still not even complete for him to this day.

2579
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:37.40
So he gets poisoned at some point, loses his pancreas.

2580
02:57:37.40 --> 02:57:38.40
So he gets poisoned.

2581
02:57:38.40 --> 02:57:39.72
He's, you know, his guts hurting.

2582
02:57:39.72 --> 02:57:40.72
He goes to the doctor.

2583
02:57:40.72 --> 02:57:42.92
The doctor's like, Hey, they're, they're poisoning people.

2584
02:57:42.92 --> 02:57:45.76
The Taliban's poisoning people lose it.

2585
02:57:45.76 --> 02:57:46.96
Like I said, loses his pancreas.

2586
02:57:46.96 --> 02:57:49.96
I mean, it's just horrible.

2587
02:57:49.96 --> 02:58:00.000
Uh, meanwhile, still no, still no real progress in, um, in his SIV, you know, to get his visa

2588
02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.92
to get over here.

2589
02:58:01.92 --> 02:58:05.96
Meanwhile, you are going through your career.

2590
02:58:05.96 --> 02:58:09.04
You take command of Lima company, third battalion, fourth Marines.

2591
02:58:09.04 --> 02:58:11.24
Um, lucky Lima.

2592
02:58:11.24 --> 02:58:15.08
So now you're kind of back in the game, back to leading troops.

2593
02:58:15.08 --> 02:58:22.16
You're going to go on a deployment with the whole deployment plan for Australia.

2594
02:58:22.16 --> 02:58:23.16
Yes.

2595
02:58:23.16 --> 02:58:24.16
Damn.

2596
02:58:24.16 --> 02:58:31.20
I never, I, when I was in the military, man, uh, the, the guys talked about Australia

2597
02:58:31.20 --> 02:58:34.68
as if it is like the promised land heaven.

2598
02:58:34.68 --> 02:58:37.24
And I never went there until I retired.

2599
02:58:37.24 --> 02:58:40.36
And it is, it's, it's frigging amazing.

2600
02:58:40.36 --> 02:58:43.52
Um, there's a place called Nusa.

2601
02:58:43.52 --> 02:58:44.72
Have you ever heard of this?

2602
02:58:44.72 --> 02:58:45.72
I was there.

2603
02:58:45.72 --> 02:58:46.72
Yeah.

2604
02:58:46.72 --> 02:58:50.88
There's not too many places in the world I would move to like tomorrow afternoon, but

2605
02:58:50.88 --> 02:58:52.16
that's a one of them.

2606
02:58:52.16 --> 02:58:57.52
The freaking waves there, they got like the most incredible waves.

2607
02:58:57.52 --> 02:58:59.16
There's a place in California called Malibu.

2608
02:58:59.16 --> 02:59:01.000
I'm sure you've heard of it.

2609
02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:07.44
There's like 10 Malibu's in a row, like all just different little spots and you can walk,

2610
02:59:07.44 --> 02:59:08.44
walk down.

2611
02:59:08.44 --> 02:59:11.40
You ever been to, uh, the San Diego zoo, the one right here in downtown?

2612
02:59:11.40 --> 02:59:12.40
Yep.

2613
02:59:12.40 --> 02:59:18.32
And it's all like, uh, all really manicured these nice paths and it just looks like this

2614
02:59:18.32 --> 02:59:21.44
is like the most like, like Jurassic Park scenario.

2615
02:59:21.44 --> 02:59:24.32
You walk around this thing at Nusa is like that.

2616
02:59:24.32 --> 02:59:27.52
It's like you're on this Jurassic Park, a beautiful nice little trail and then you're

2617
02:59:27.52 --> 02:59:30.40
just watching these beautiful, beautiful waves.

2618
02:59:30.40 --> 02:59:34.72
Um, so you're going to Australia, uh, your company commander.

2619
02:59:34.72 --> 02:59:36.44
How, how was that?

2620
02:59:36.44 --> 02:59:37.44
How was that?

2621
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:38.44
How are you like being in command again?

2622
02:59:38.44 --> 02:59:39.44
Yeah.

2623
02:59:39.44 --> 02:59:43.72
When I was at the school of infantry, I, there was one regiment, seventh Marine regiment,

2624
02:59:43.72 --> 02:59:47.000
which is out in 29 palms and they were the only ones doing the specialist magtaf.

2625
02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:50.08
So they were going to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria.

2626
02:59:50.08 --> 02:59:53.72
And so I contact the monitor and I say, Hey, I want to volunteer to be a company commander.

2627
02:59:53.72 --> 02:59:55.24
Cause I know it's my time's coming up.

2628
02:59:55.24 --> 02:59:57.36
I want to go out to seven Marines.

2629
02:59:57.36 --> 03:00:00.52
Not a lot of people volunteered to go to 29 palms.

2630
03:00:00.52 --> 03:00:02.68
And so within like 30 seconds, he writes me back.

2631
03:00:02.68 --> 03:00:03.68
It's like, you got it.

2632
03:00:03.68 --> 03:00:06.72
And this in the monitor is like a person who's always impossible to get a hold of, you know,

2633
03:00:06.72 --> 03:00:07.72
you're writing.

2634
03:00:07.72 --> 03:00:11.84
And this, this incident instantaneous, you got, you want to turn up home?

2635
03:00:11.84 --> 03:00:12.84
No problem.

2636
03:00:12.84 --> 03:00:13.84
You got it, man.

2637
03:00:13.84 --> 03:00:14.84
Uh, I'm like, cool.

2638
03:00:14.84 --> 03:00:15.84
He's like, you're going to go to three, four.

2639
03:00:15.84 --> 03:00:16.84
I'm like, okay, cool.

2640
03:00:16.84 --> 03:00:23.28
Uh, and then I find out that they're not even a bit, they had deactivated because of force

2641
03:00:23.28 --> 03:00:24.28
cut structure.

2642
03:00:24.28 --> 03:00:25.28
And then they had reactivated.

2643
03:00:25.28 --> 03:00:28.96
So there, there's only an H and S company of three, four right now.

2644
03:00:28.96 --> 03:00:30.64
And I'm like, okay.

2645
03:00:30.64 --> 03:00:32.76
And by the way, they're going to Australia.

2646
03:00:32.76 --> 03:00:36.96
And so I call, I call him on her back and say, Hey, I said, I want to go to 29 palms.

2647
03:00:36.96 --> 03:00:39.04
I go on one of the deployments to Iraq.

2648
03:00:39.04 --> 03:00:42.76
And he's like, uh, you said 29 palms, you got 29 palms.

2649
03:00:42.76 --> 03:00:43.76
Got to go.

2650
03:00:43.76 --> 03:00:47.56
And, uh, so I was initially a little but hurt.

2651
03:00:47.56 --> 03:00:51.52
Uh, but ultimately yeah, Australia doesn't suck.

2652
03:00:51.52 --> 03:00:54.28
Uh, there are worse places to be deployed.

2653
03:00:54.28 --> 03:00:56.52
And so had a good time there.

2654
03:00:56.52 --> 03:00:58.80
Um, company command was awesome.

2655
03:00:58.80 --> 03:01:01.24
I mean, company command was awesome.

2656
03:01:01.24 --> 03:01:03.56
It's just 150.

2657
03:01:03.56 --> 03:01:09.44
Savage aggressive out in 29 palms, just attacking, shooting shit, blowing shit up.

2658
03:01:09.44 --> 03:01:11.12
And, uh, great Lieutenant.

2659
03:01:11.12 --> 03:01:12.12
It's great.

2660
03:01:12.12 --> 03:01:13.12
Petunia Sargent's great squad leaders.

2661
03:01:13.12 --> 03:01:16.52
I mean, just an aggressive company, aggressive workup.

2662
03:01:16.52 --> 03:01:20.20
Uh, it's, it's an infantryman's Disneyland out there.

2663
03:01:20.20 --> 03:01:23.84
You know, and so it's every day you get to go do great infantry training.

2664
03:01:23.84 --> 03:01:25.84
And so, uh, workup was a blast.

2665
03:01:25.84 --> 03:01:26.84
It was a great team.

2666
03:01:26.84 --> 03:01:29.28
I was very, very fortunate to have the team that I had.

2667
03:01:29.28 --> 03:01:32.08
And then, uh, yeah, we had a good time in Australia.

2668
03:01:32.08 --> 03:01:35.20
Any major leadership lessons learned there?

2669
03:01:35.20 --> 03:01:36.20
A whole lot.

2670
03:01:36.20 --> 03:01:37.80
Um, for sure.

2671
03:01:37.80 --> 03:01:47.72
I think I become very obsessive in how I approach training and command.

2672
03:01:47.72 --> 03:01:55.52
And it's because at a very young age, I gained a great appreciation for the consequence of

2673
03:01:55.52 --> 03:01:56.72
this profession.

2674
03:01:56.72 --> 03:01:59.60
Uh, that there, that it's not called duty.

2675
03:01:59.60 --> 03:02:05.20
There is no responding, uh, and that when these kids are dead, they're dead forever.

2676
03:02:05.20 --> 03:02:12.16
And that the whole that is left is felt for eternity.

2677
03:02:12.16 --> 03:02:19.84
And, uh, and having had that shape me at, so that's how I, I approach everything that

2678
03:02:19.84 --> 03:02:26.36
I do is like, I will not stop until I know that these Marines are as lethal as possible.

2679
03:02:26.36 --> 03:02:29.36
And then I had the best opportunity to come back to their moms, you know, and their wives

2680
03:02:29.36 --> 03:02:31.36
and their children.

2681
03:02:31.36 --> 03:02:35.56
And so push, push, push.

2682
03:02:35.56 --> 03:02:37.76
And um, also I'm very competitive.

2683
03:02:37.76 --> 03:02:41.20
And so like I want to be the best, but to know what to be the best company I want.

2684
03:02:41.20 --> 03:02:46.36
And so when with, with that in mind, you know, we were the main effort company.

2685
03:02:46.36 --> 03:02:51.04
Uh, we got, uh, during all the big exercises and then on deployment, we got to go to Queensland

2686
03:02:51.04 --> 03:02:57.76
and I got to become part of a, uh, Australian battalions that my boss and where the rest

2687
03:02:57.76 --> 03:03:01.80
of everybody stayed back in Darwin and so it's like staying in Indiana or being in Malibu,

2688
03:03:01.80 --> 03:03:04.32
you know, so it's like, uh, you want to get it.

2689
03:03:04.32 --> 03:03:10.76
And so, uh, it Queensland is much nicer and, and I was a senior Marine in Queensland.

2690
03:03:10.76 --> 03:03:14.16
Uh, so a lot of this like was pretty good.

2691
03:03:14.16 --> 03:03:25.72
Um, but I didn't have all that came at a cost where I drove my Marine so hard that, uh,

2692
03:03:25.72 --> 03:03:29.48
I burned them out, uh, pissed them off.

2693
03:03:29.48 --> 03:03:38.20
Um, and I could have had a more harmonious approach to leadership and I look at you either,

2694
03:03:38.20 --> 03:03:44.24
you're either, I'm either looking at you professionally or personal as a person, but not both at

2695
03:03:44.24 --> 03:03:45.24
the same time.

2696
03:03:45.24 --> 03:03:49.36
And so if you come into my office and you, you could be anybody and say, Hey, sir, this

2697
03:03:49.36 --> 03:03:51.32
my mom got breast cancer.

2698
03:03:51.32 --> 03:03:52.32
Okay.

2699
03:03:52.32 --> 03:03:54.88
Whatever I can do to support you right now, how can I help you?

2700
03:03:54.88 --> 03:03:56.68
Like you have my undivided attention.

2701
03:03:56.68 --> 03:03:57.68
I care about you.

2702
03:03:57.68 --> 03:04:02.44
How, so I will still treat you very much like, like you're my son.

2703
03:04:02.44 --> 03:04:08.84
And, uh, but outside of that, I'm just, I, I'm ruthless.

2704
03:04:08.84 --> 03:04:10.40
Like I don't want you to be sorry.

2705
03:04:10.40 --> 03:04:11.80
I just want you to be better.

2706
03:04:11.80 --> 03:04:12.84
I don't want your excuses.

2707
03:04:12.84 --> 03:04:14.36
I just want your results.

2708
03:04:14.36 --> 03:04:18.44
Uh, the solution is generally just work harder and be more aggressive.

2709
03:04:18.44 --> 03:04:25.92
And so I drove, you know, redlined the comp and that's a long workup, a long deployment.

2710
03:04:25.92 --> 03:04:32.56
And by the end of it, um, I'd really wore out a lot of those Marines.

2711
03:04:32.56 --> 03:04:37.82
And I think I, I think I could have had a more harmonious approach to, to leadership

2712
03:04:37.82 --> 03:04:45.16
and try to at least keep them humans and Marines kind of a little bit at the same time.

2713
03:04:45.16 --> 03:04:49.72
But, uh, so, you know, if I have an opportunity to be a battalion commander, I think I'm going

2714
03:04:49.72 --> 03:04:52.92
to try to be more mindful of, of that.

2715
03:04:52.92 --> 03:04:53.92
Yeah.

2716
03:04:53.92 --> 03:05:01.16
It's definitely something that you, you, uh, a lot of these great leaders or allegedly

2717
03:05:01.16 --> 03:05:07.80
great leaders or even myth, mythological leaders that we have in the military, you,

2718
03:05:07.80 --> 03:05:12.16
you, you, you see, that's the, that's the thing that shines through about a lot of them.

2719
03:05:12.16 --> 03:05:13.84
Um, that you don't see on the surface.

2720
03:05:13.84 --> 03:05:17.52
But when you read about them or you read their books, like Chesty, puller, like, oh, this

2721
03:05:17.52 --> 03:05:18.64
is just the ultimate hard ass.

2722
03:05:18.64 --> 03:05:23.36
But when you read about him and how he treated the troops and how much he cared about them,

2723
03:05:23.36 --> 03:05:27.44
um, you know, Hackworth the same way, like the, like the hardest dudes you could ever

2724
03:05:27.44 --> 03:05:33.12
imagine and yet they would completely, um, know when they were pushing too hard, pull

2725
03:05:33.12 --> 03:05:37.52
back the reins, protect their guys from stupid shit.

2726
03:05:37.52 --> 03:05:43.60
And like, that's why these guys were so totally beloved by, by their troops because they,

2727
03:05:43.60 --> 03:05:47.96
the troops want to get pushed hard, but they don't want to do dumb shit and they know,

2728
03:05:47.96 --> 03:05:50.28
and they're, and they're humans and they need to get treated that way.

2729
03:05:50.28 --> 03:05:54.36
So that's, uh, definitely some great advice for anybody that's in a leadership position

2730
03:05:54.36 --> 03:05:55.36
in any scenario.

2731
03:05:55.36 --> 03:05:57.72
Um, yeah, you want to push hard.

2732
03:05:57.72 --> 03:05:58.72
Yeah.

2733
03:05:58.72 --> 03:05:59.72
You want to win.

2734
03:05:59.72 --> 03:06:00.72
Yeah.

2735
03:06:00.72 --> 03:06:01.72
You want to do better than everybody else.

2736
03:06:01.72 --> 03:06:05.000
And one of the ways to get the most out of your people is to treat them like people.

2737
03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:10.88
Um, you come back from that deployment.

2738
03:06:10.88 --> 03:06:13.56
Is that when you get re, you actually get remarried is after that deployment.

2739
03:06:13.56 --> 03:06:14.56
Yes.

2740
03:06:14.56 --> 03:06:16.08
So you get remarried.

2741
03:06:16.08 --> 03:06:19.76
Um, all's looking good.

2742
03:06:19.76 --> 03:06:24.44
You are now driving across country, get your next set of orders.

2743
03:06:24.44 --> 03:06:26.000
I'm going to, I'm going to go to the book here.

2744
03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:30.12
Um, you're driving across country.

2745
03:06:30.12 --> 03:06:32.48
Now I had a lot to think about.

2746
03:06:32.48 --> 03:06:35.20
I'd been to war twice.

2747
03:06:35.20 --> 03:06:39.20
I had married divorced and was about to remarry the same woman.

2748
03:06:39.20 --> 03:06:43.80
I had commanded a company of Marines and the Marine Corps had seen fit to select me for

2749
03:06:43.80 --> 03:06:45.84
a promotion to major.

2750
03:06:45.84 --> 03:06:51.36
I was now a career Marine on my way to spend three years molding future Navy and Marine

2751
03:06:51.36 --> 03:06:52.36
officers.

2752
03:06:52.36 --> 03:06:57.76
This is when you're heading to the Naval Academy via some schooling.

2753
03:06:57.76 --> 03:07:05.04
As I crossed our nation, I visited the graves of nine dark horse Marines where and when

2754
03:07:05.04 --> 03:07:09.76
I could, I visited their families.

2755
03:07:09.76 --> 03:07:13.36
They were still living, breathing men to me.

2756
03:07:13.36 --> 03:07:17.36
They certainly were to their families.

2757
03:07:17.36 --> 03:07:22.32
As I began to turn my thoughts to training and educating future officers, I felt it critical

2758
03:07:22.32 --> 03:07:30.44
to visit and reflect in the presence of some of the men who had made me who I am.

2759
03:07:30.44 --> 03:07:33.12
Corporal Tevin Nguyen.

2760
03:07:33.12 --> 03:07:35.84
Sergeant Jason Pedo.

2761
03:07:35.84 --> 03:07:41.80
Pito Sergeant Jason Pito.

2762
03:07:41.80 --> 03:07:45.04
Lance Corporal Alec Catherwood.

2763
03:07:45.04 --> 03:07:48.80
First Lieutenant Robert Kelly.

2764
03:07:48.80 --> 03:07:57.56
First Lieutenant William Donnelly, the fourth Corporal Derek Wyatt.

2765
03:07:57.56 --> 03:08:01.72
Lance Corporal Arden Ben Agua.

2766
03:08:01.72 --> 03:08:05.52
First Sergeant Christopher Carlisle.

2767
03:08:05.52 --> 03:08:10.64
And Sergeant Matthew Abbate.

2768
03:08:10.64 --> 03:08:16.92
All but Sergeant Pito and first Sergeant Carlisle died in Sangen.

2769
03:08:16.92 --> 03:08:22.44
Sergeant Pito made it back to Walter Reed Hospital in Maryland before he died.

2770
03:08:22.44 --> 03:08:28.68
First Sergeant Carlisle survived his wounds the day that the day Zach and I watched from

2771
03:08:28.68 --> 03:08:34.88
a distance, then got promoted, retired, and was killed in a motorcycle accident.

2772
03:08:34.88 --> 03:08:39.000
I owed him much of my sanity while in Sangen.

2773
03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:43.08
I needed to tell him that.

2774
03:08:43.08 --> 03:08:47.44
Matt Abbate was the heart and soul of 3-5.

2775
03:08:47.44 --> 03:08:53.12
A recipient of the Navy Cross, the second highest award for valor presented by our nation,

2776
03:08:53.12 --> 03:08:57.56
his death and combat stunned every Marine in the battalion.

2777
03:08:57.56 --> 03:09:03.88
He was a scout sniper who spent much of his time in support of Kilo Company.

2778
03:09:03.88 --> 03:09:13.88
He was the one, the one of whom Heraclitus spoke, the one who will bring the others back.

2779
03:09:13.88 --> 03:09:17.08
No one was cooler than Abbate.

2780
03:09:17.08 --> 03:09:21.22
No one cared more than Abbate.

2781
03:09:21.22 --> 03:09:28.60
He was the author of the gunfighting commandments posted on the wall at PB Fires and now inscribed

2782
03:09:28.60 --> 03:09:31.92
on the back of his grave marker.

2783
03:09:31.92 --> 03:09:38.32
Quote, Thou shalt never leave the wire without bandana containing at least four inches of

2784
03:09:38.32 --> 03:09:40.84
slack.

2785
03:09:40.84 --> 03:09:45.64
In any situation thou shalt blaze.

2786
03:09:45.64 --> 03:09:52.12
Nothing matters more than thy brethren to thy left and right.

2787
03:09:52.12 --> 03:09:56.04
Thou shalt protect no matter what.

2788
03:09:56.04 --> 03:10:05.20
When going out in a hail of gunfire, thou shalt pop them nugs until the body runs dry of blood.

2789
03:10:05.20 --> 03:10:19.12
And look hella sick.

2790
03:10:19.12 --> 03:10:22.56
I found a newspaper article about Abbate.

2791
03:10:22.56 --> 03:10:28.28
It said, Sergeant James Finney 25 served with Abbate in Sangin.

2792
03:10:28.28 --> 03:10:32.72
When he heard of his friend's death, he had the same reaction as many of the Marines in

2793
03:10:32.72 --> 03:10:35.96
the battalion.

2794
03:10:35.96 --> 03:10:51.92
How do we win this war without him?

2795
03:10:51.92 --> 03:10:59.20
As you're driving across country, as you're stopping by gravestones, as you're talking

2796
03:10:59.20 --> 03:11:09.76
to families, how is your perspective changing?

2797
03:11:09.76 --> 03:11:16.24
These goals of our families are incredible.

2798
03:11:16.24 --> 03:11:25.72
And the loss for them is as present today as it was the day they lost their son.

2799
03:11:25.72 --> 03:11:33.52
And the pain doesn't go away.

2800
03:11:33.52 --> 03:11:42.96
And we have a collective duty and responsibility to carry their son's legacy forward and to

2801
03:11:42.96 --> 03:11:47.64
do everything that we can to honor their sacrifice.

2802
03:11:47.64 --> 03:11:54.68
I have a personal responsibility to honor these men and how I live.

2803
03:11:54.68 --> 03:11:58.08
And a responsibility to the families.

2804
03:11:58.08 --> 03:12:04.92
And so, you know, Tevin Nguyen was killed December 28th.

2805
03:12:04.92 --> 03:12:09.08
His son, he'd been there for the birth of his son right before he deployed.

2806
03:12:09.08 --> 03:12:12.48
And that was it.

2807
03:12:12.48 --> 03:12:16.80
And so going to see little Tevin Jr.

2808
03:12:16.80 --> 03:12:25.28
Part of Benagua, his first generation American, both his parents' immigrants, was killed when

2809
03:12:25.28 --> 03:12:28.16
he was 19.

2810
03:12:28.16 --> 03:12:34.80
He was the, of that engineer squad attached to Kila Company, he was the 12th Marine that

2811
03:12:34.80 --> 03:12:38.96
was injured or killed.

2812
03:12:38.96 --> 03:12:46.000
And I got to tell this family, like, your son is my hero and your son is the reason

2813
03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.28
I'm alive.

2814
03:12:48.28 --> 03:12:53.16
And that everybody in his position before him, who was walking point through minefield,

2815
03:12:53.16 --> 03:12:57.04
either died or lost or limb, and your son, when he was 18 years old, still grabbed his

2816
03:12:57.04 --> 03:13:01.24
pack, grabbed his rifle and a metal detector and walked out in front of us.

2817
03:13:01.24 --> 03:13:08.36
Never once turning to me at 18 years old and saying, sir, can somebody else take this responsibility?

2818
03:13:08.36 --> 03:13:13.44
My son is his namesake.

2819
03:13:13.44 --> 03:13:19.24
And the idea that these men knew the consequences ahead of time and win anyways.

2820
03:13:19.24 --> 03:13:23.48
And then if you told them how the story ends, every single one of them would be right where

2821
03:13:23.48 --> 03:13:29.08
they were fighting next to their brothers.

2822
03:13:29.08 --> 03:13:35.08
Manabate, when he got his Navy Cross, the squad leader got shot and one Marine goes

2823
03:13:35.08 --> 03:13:36.56
to help the squad leader, he gets blown up.

2824
03:13:36.56 --> 03:13:38.72
The corpsman goes to help the Marine that gets blown up, he gets blown up.

2825
03:13:38.72 --> 03:13:41.12
The next Marine goes to help the corpsman, he gets blown up.

2826
03:13:41.12 --> 03:13:44.52
Finally, everyone recognized we're in the middle of a minefield and every time somebody

2827
03:13:44.52 --> 03:13:47.48
moves, they're killed.

2828
03:13:47.48 --> 03:13:49.40
So people stop moving.

2829
03:13:49.40 --> 03:13:52.24
It's a normal thing to do.

2830
03:13:52.24 --> 03:13:54.60
Everybody but one Marine.

2831
03:13:54.60 --> 03:13:56.76
And he runs and he treats all the casualties.

2832
03:13:56.76 --> 03:13:58.08
He coordinates the medivac.

2833
03:13:58.08 --> 03:14:03.44
He grabs the metal detector, sweeps to LZ, doesn't not train to do that, just proofs the minefield

2834
03:14:03.44 --> 03:14:08.80
with his feet, repels the enemy, calls in that helicopter.

2835
03:14:08.80 --> 03:14:24.20
And so when I talk to these families, it's so heavy but it's so important.

2836
03:14:24.20 --> 03:14:33.84
And I just thank God that men like this lived and that I had, and just for a moment I got

2837
03:14:33.84 --> 03:14:35.72
to know them.

2838
03:14:35.72 --> 03:14:42.20
And not only did these men die well but they lived well.

2839
03:14:42.20 --> 03:14:46.56
And they're meant to celebrate.

2840
03:14:46.56 --> 03:14:55.52
And it is my lifelong duty to continue to honor these men, every opportunity I get.

2841
03:14:55.52 --> 03:14:57.52
That's it.

2842
03:14:57.52 --> 03:15:06.40
I know I eventually told Mark Lee's mom a story about Mark, very similar to what you're

2843
03:15:06.40 --> 03:15:07.40
talking about.

2844
03:15:07.40 --> 03:15:14.40
So I would start off by telling her that in Vietnam, like the point men would rotate because

2845
03:15:14.40 --> 03:15:16.68
your walking point, you're going to get ambushed.

2846
03:15:16.68 --> 03:15:17.68
You're going to get blown up.

2847
03:15:17.68 --> 03:15:21.44
You're going to hit a trip wire and they would rotate those guys.

2848
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:25.76
And in Ramada, you'd be in the lead vehicle.

2849
03:15:25.76 --> 03:15:26.96
You're the one that's going to get blown up.

2850
03:15:26.96 --> 03:15:29.12
You're the one that's going to get hit in the ID.

2851
03:15:29.12 --> 03:15:37.16
And especially being the gunner, no one now you're not any armor and you're just totally,

2852
03:15:37.16 --> 03:15:39.24
you're exposed.

2853
03:15:39.24 --> 03:15:44.08
And we'd line up the vehicles and Mark Lee, you know, he's a new guy.

2854
03:15:44.08 --> 03:15:46.96
And so guess what he is?

2855
03:15:46.96 --> 03:15:49.68
Turret gunner in vehicle one.

2856
03:15:49.68 --> 03:15:50.68
Night after night.

2857
03:15:50.68 --> 03:15:56.68
And when you leave the gate at Ramada, when you drive towards the gate to go out into

2858
03:15:56.68 --> 03:16:05.84
the town, there was a vehicle graveyard and there's like 75 or 100 vehicles out there

2859
03:16:05.84 --> 03:16:08.28
and they're just twisted and gnarled.

2860
03:16:08.28 --> 03:16:15.92
They've all been dragged back and every one of those vehicles represents one, two, three,

2861
03:16:15.92 --> 03:16:20.92
four, five casualties, wounded, killed, you know, just, just heinous.

2862
03:16:20.92 --> 03:16:24.84
And that's what I don't know who the, I don't know who the hell decided that was a good

2863
03:16:24.84 --> 03:16:28.32
place for the vehicle graveyard, but it was a shitty place for the vehicle graveyard because

2864
03:16:28.32 --> 03:16:30.52
that's what you saw.

2865
03:16:30.52 --> 03:16:51.48
And same thing with Mark, man, never asked for somebody else to take his spot.

2866
03:16:51.48 --> 03:16:57.44
Some heroic dudes for sure and did it with a smile on his face.

2867
03:16:57.44 --> 03:16:58.44
I go, how you feeling?

2868
03:16:58.44 --> 03:16:59.44
Hey, Mark, what's up, man?

2869
03:16:59.44 --> 03:17:00.44
How you feeling?

2870
03:17:00.44 --> 03:17:04.000
And like his favorite response, he liked to gamble a little bit.

2871
03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:09.88
He said, I'm feeling lucky, sir.

2872
03:17:09.88 --> 03:17:13.48
So that's the guys we get to work with.

2873
03:17:13.48 --> 03:17:25.28
Now this, you're taking all this with you to be a professor at the Naval Academy, which

2874
03:17:25.28 --> 03:17:30.12
is a pretty, I mean, you've got all this awesome combat experience.

2875
03:17:30.12 --> 03:17:35.48
I know, awesome might not be the right word, but you've got this real experience and you're

2876
03:17:35.48 --> 03:17:40.62
going to take that back now to the Naval Academy.

2877
03:17:40.62 --> 03:17:43.12
How did you, how did you end up getting that bill?

2878
03:17:43.12 --> 03:17:44.76
How did that bill end up coming about?

2879
03:17:44.76 --> 03:17:47.96
Yeah, I think it was a mistake.

2880
03:17:47.96 --> 03:17:54.12
I was deployed to Australia and I said, you know, when's the last time you read any fiction?

2881
03:17:54.12 --> 03:18:00.56
All you do is read biographies and you used to be in high school, you were smart.

2882
03:18:00.56 --> 03:18:01.76
You'd like to do AP literature.

2883
03:18:01.76 --> 03:18:05.20
You let your kind of, as you pointed out, nerdy.

2884
03:18:05.20 --> 03:18:10.76
And then you progressively got dumber through college and maybe try to read a book that

2885
03:18:10.76 --> 03:18:20.000
isn't just a, and so I Googled popular works of fiction and the first one that came up

2886
03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.72
was Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.

2887
03:18:22.72 --> 03:18:25.68
I read that and I said, oh, I like this.

2888
03:18:25.68 --> 03:18:31.24
And a message came out and we said, we need someone to teach English at the Naval Academy.

2889
03:18:31.24 --> 03:18:34.60
I know anything about the Naval Academy and not an Academy guy.

2890
03:18:34.60 --> 03:18:36.16
I'm not an English major.

2891
03:18:36.16 --> 03:18:38.52
I failed English.

2892
03:18:38.52 --> 03:18:41.52
And I said, well, maybe that's me.

2893
03:18:41.52 --> 03:18:43.60
Sounds like a good pick.

2894
03:18:43.60 --> 03:18:50.04
And so I'm a guy that, you know, shoot your shot and put my hand in the ring and, yeah,

2895
03:18:50.04 --> 03:18:57.24
clearly the Marine Corps needs to refine that selection process, but they picked me.

2896
03:18:57.24 --> 03:19:05.52
And before I knew it, I was at Georgetown in an MA, English MA program, get in my ass

2897
03:19:05.52 --> 03:19:08.48
kicked.

2898
03:19:08.48 --> 03:19:11.44
That qualified to be in that program.

2899
03:19:11.44 --> 03:19:15.68
I should have been in the T-Ball League and I showed up at the All-Star game.

2900
03:19:15.68 --> 03:19:17.20
How long was that course of instruction?

2901
03:19:17.20 --> 03:19:18.80
So it was supposed to be a two-year program.

2902
03:19:18.80 --> 03:19:20.52
The Marine Corps likes to keep the morning tight.

2903
03:19:20.52 --> 03:19:21.52
So 12 months.

2904
03:19:21.52 --> 03:19:25.08
So I did a two-year program in one month, or 12 months.

2905
03:19:25.08 --> 03:19:32.40
So yeah, working on a compressed timeline, been in the fleet at that point for 10, 11

2906
03:19:32.40 --> 03:19:33.88
years.

2907
03:19:33.88 --> 03:19:40.64
And so just got thrown in the deep end of the pool, didn't know how to swim.

2908
03:19:40.64 --> 03:19:42.56
But it was an incredible experience.

2909
03:19:42.56 --> 03:19:47.24
It was an experience I really needed because I very much was just a hammer.

2910
03:19:47.24 --> 03:19:49.000
And that's all I knew.

2911
03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:54.72
And I had no other tools in life and studying literature and writing.

2912
03:19:54.72 --> 03:20:02.000
And it really helped me work out a lot of things that I had not unpacked yet.

2913
03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:06.36
And so I knew I was going to be outside of my comfort zone.

2914
03:20:06.36 --> 03:20:11.68
I didn't know quite how out of my comfort zone I was, but I was outside of it.

2915
03:20:11.68 --> 03:20:16.76
And from orientation to when we're going around the table where I think you just tell people

2916
03:20:16.76 --> 03:20:19.000
what's your name is, like I'm Tom Fromschka, like no.

2917
03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:23.40
From orientation I was already out of my depth through conclusion.

2918
03:20:23.40 --> 03:20:27.92
But I had some great friends that I met there that helped me and I had some great professors.

2919
03:20:27.92 --> 03:20:32.64
And so yeah, then a year later I show up and I start teaching English.

2920
03:20:32.64 --> 03:20:35.04
And how was it when you showed up at the Naval Academy?

2921
03:20:35.04 --> 03:20:37.08
Had you ever even been to the Naval Academy before?

2922
03:20:37.08 --> 03:20:42.04
No, I couldn't even told you where the Naval Academy was when I applied for that position.

2923
03:20:42.04 --> 03:20:46.88
Just I just thought, what I thought is like they're going to pay me to go read books and

2924
03:20:46.88 --> 03:20:48.68
I got to write a little book report on it.

2925
03:20:48.68 --> 03:20:53.000
Like that's what I thought like an English program would be.

2926
03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:56.20
And then we're having these discussions in class and I'm like, what the hell are these

2927
03:20:56.20 --> 03:20:57.20
words?

2928
03:20:57.20 --> 03:20:58.68
They're supposed to be English and we're using all these words.

2929
03:20:58.68 --> 03:21:00.40
I have no idea what I was talking about.

2930
03:21:00.40 --> 03:21:06.04
Like we're doing this close reading and literary analysis and all this kind of stuff.

2931
03:21:06.04 --> 03:21:07.04
But yeah, I got up to Annapolis.

2932
03:21:07.04 --> 03:21:09.16
It's beautiful.

2933
03:21:09.16 --> 03:21:12.08
And it was an awesome, awesome job.

2934
03:21:12.08 --> 03:21:13.20
These midshipmen were hungry.

2935
03:21:13.20 --> 03:21:16.32
They're good, good Americans.

2936
03:21:16.32 --> 03:21:21.12
And I got to pick my favorite books and then talk to them about my favorite books, you

2937
03:21:21.12 --> 03:21:22.12
know?

2938
03:21:22.12 --> 03:21:28.24
I was doing Fields of Fire and Mad Horn and Gates Fire and Starship Troopers and so.

2939
03:21:28.24 --> 03:21:31.20
That course was not offered when I was an English major.

2940
03:21:31.20 --> 03:21:33.88
I didn't get to do any of those books, unfortunately.

2941
03:21:33.88 --> 03:21:41.68
And so yeah, teaching these midshipmen poetry and composition and but I was teaching a little

2942
03:21:41.68 --> 03:21:42.68
bit about literature.

2943
03:21:42.68 --> 03:21:45.36
I was teaching a little bit about composition.

2944
03:21:45.36 --> 03:21:51.88
I was teaching a lot about leadership in the classroom and it was a super rewarding tour

2945
03:21:51.88 --> 03:21:55.92
and really, really enjoyed my time there.

2946
03:21:55.92 --> 03:22:01.60
Now one thing that you talk about in the book is as you start as you start teaching Justin

2947
03:22:01.60 --> 03:22:07.32
Justin McLeod, who's one of your Marines dies of an overdose.

2948
03:22:07.32 --> 03:22:15.08
And in the same month, two of your other Marines.

2949
03:22:15.08 --> 03:22:18.92
Die by suicide.

2950
03:22:18.92 --> 03:22:29.000
You at this juncture ask for and get counseling, professional counseling.

2951
03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:34.96
What did that consist of and how did it help you?

2952
03:22:34.96 --> 03:22:41.48
So McLeod wasn't my first Marine that I lost to the war after it, but McLeod was tough

2953
03:22:41.48 --> 03:22:44.76
in a lot of ways.

2954
03:22:44.76 --> 03:22:51.000
I still have a hard time coming out of the yellow, getting into the white and being vulnerable.

2955
03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:55.32
When I would sing my daughter to bed and she was one years old at the time, I'd always

2956
03:22:55.32 --> 03:23:00.32
try to just be real present and vulnerable with her and sing this little light of mine

2957
03:23:00.32 --> 03:23:01.32
with her.

2958
03:23:01.32 --> 03:23:04.64
And then I'd just finish that and then I'd come to my room and one of my Marines from

2959
03:23:04.64 --> 03:23:08.88
saying it says, hey, you got to call me.

2960
03:23:08.88 --> 03:23:16.80
And McLeod, he had shown up to 35 in 2008, he had gone on the Iraq deployment, he had

2961
03:23:16.80 --> 03:23:18.36
gone on the Mew deployment.

2962
03:23:18.36 --> 03:23:22.000
And so he'd done our work up, but then he was going to EAS.

2963
03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:25.80
He said, you know, I thought I was going to extend by just had a son.

2964
03:23:25.80 --> 03:23:26.80
I'm going to EAS.

2965
03:23:26.80 --> 03:23:29.44
And I said, you know, you're my best shot.

2966
03:23:29.44 --> 03:23:30.92
You're my best nav guy.

2967
03:23:30.92 --> 03:23:36.80
Like, I know you just had a son, but we really need you.

2968
03:23:36.80 --> 03:23:39.12
So do whatever you need to do.

2969
03:23:39.12 --> 03:23:42.24
If you want to EAS, EAS, if you, but I hope you extend.

2970
03:23:42.24 --> 03:23:46.24
And he comes back and says, you know, sir, you're my family too.

2971
03:23:46.24 --> 03:23:51.16
Few months later, the engineer steps on the pressure plate.

2972
03:23:51.16 --> 03:24:00.64
The McLeod is over the charge and they both get hit and I'm about like five people back.

2973
03:24:00.64 --> 03:24:14.64
And as I come up, as I come up, one of my Marines hands me McLeod's fingers and I look

2974
03:24:14.64 --> 03:24:23.16
at McLeod, he's missing his arm and his legs and like, it was Teague and I said, thanks

2975
03:24:23.16 --> 03:24:25.32
Teague.

2976
03:24:25.32 --> 03:24:26.56
And now I'm in this like weird position.

2977
03:24:26.56 --> 03:24:30.60
I had these body parts with a body part that doesn't exist anymore.

2978
03:24:30.60 --> 03:24:37.04
I put him in my cargo pocket and my engineer is going into shock.

2979
03:24:37.04 --> 03:24:39.32
So I, all I have is my frog top.

2980
03:24:39.32 --> 03:24:41.24
So I take my, take my blouse off.

2981
03:24:41.24 --> 03:24:45.52
I wrap him in my blouse and I've got nothing on under my flat jacket and I go back to McLeod

2982
03:24:45.52 --> 03:24:49.68
and initially he's like real calm and cool.

2983
03:24:49.68 --> 03:24:54.76
He's smoking a cigarette saying like kill these mothers, you know, whatever.

2984
03:24:54.76 --> 03:24:59.52
And, but we're having a really hard time landing the Medevac bird and there's probably

2985
03:24:59.52 --> 03:25:02.64
five or six guys all working on them.

2986
03:25:02.64 --> 03:25:06.000
When you've got an amputee, it takes a couple dudes to patch up, you know, each thing.

2987
03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:09.80
And so what I would always do is the first thing is I would take a junior Marine off

2988
03:25:09.80 --> 03:25:14.08
and once I had security set, once I had the Medevac in motion, I would take that junior

2989
03:25:14.08 --> 03:25:17.04
Marine off so that they can hold security and I get my hands in that Marine's guts.

2990
03:25:17.04 --> 03:25:24.16
And so, but it was dusk and they were having a hard time telling the laser or smoke.

2991
03:25:24.16 --> 03:25:26.08
They couldn't, they couldn't see where to land.

2992
03:25:26.08 --> 03:25:30.72
And so, and then every time they'd come in, the zone would get hot and Taliban would start

2993
03:25:30.72 --> 03:25:31.72
shooting at them.

2994
03:25:31.72 --> 03:25:38.48
And so they keep waving off and McLeod starts to succumb to his wounds.

2995
03:25:38.48 --> 03:25:47.16
And I, like I said, IOC and the Marine Corps training is, is just so it's phenomenal.

2996
03:25:47.16 --> 03:25:52.64
It prepares you to do the things technically and tactically.

2997
03:25:52.64 --> 03:25:57.40
But there's nothing that can prepare you to have a conversation with a guy who you convince

2998
03:25:57.40 --> 03:26:03.08
to extend, who said, I'm going to get out because I want to teach my son to play baseball

2999
03:26:03.08 --> 03:26:06.64
because McLeod had high school scholarship or college scholarship to go play baseball,

3000
03:26:06.64 --> 03:26:11.80
but he enlisted and said, and I'm saying, Hey, you got to stay here for Desmond because

3001
03:26:11.80 --> 03:26:19.96
someday you're going to teach him how to play catch and you get and, and knowing that what

3002
03:26:19.96 --> 03:26:21.36
is he going to be able to do?

3003
03:26:21.36 --> 03:26:26.12
You know, he's got no arm, no legs.

3004
03:26:26.12 --> 03:26:28.08
And he starts a flat line.

3005
03:26:28.08 --> 03:26:36.88
And I just like everything in me wants to cry for this Marine, but everybody's, you know,

3006
03:26:36.88 --> 03:26:40.20
as a leader, like you said, everybody is looking at you, how you're going to respond to this

3007
03:26:40.20 --> 03:26:41.20
thing.

3008
03:26:41.20 --> 03:26:44.48
And, and, and I got to keep trying to talk to this guy about finding that will to live

3009
03:26:44.48 --> 03:26:47.44
again for his son.

3010
03:26:47.44 --> 03:26:54.24
And very, and the will to live is a powerful thing and he stays and he, and, and, but he,

3011
03:26:54.24 --> 03:27:00.96
he never stopped fighting that battle in 10 years later, saying and claimed him.

3012
03:27:00.96 --> 03:27:15.52
And, and so, that's what got me on the road to PB about they, but it also, I was still

3013
03:27:15.52 --> 03:27:26.16
very destructive in my tendencies, in my thoughts, in my actions and in my family was the casualties.

3014
03:27:26.16 --> 03:27:32.52
And so I was still fighting the war myself in a lot of ways and being selfish and being

3015
03:27:32.52 --> 03:27:34.56
harmful.

3016
03:27:34.56 --> 03:27:38.72
And my family was the one suffering.

3017
03:27:38.72 --> 03:27:46.12
And you know, I thought, I just push, push, push.

3018
03:27:46.12 --> 03:27:48.84
That's how I deal with everything you push.

3019
03:27:48.84 --> 03:27:57.44
And but you got to look at this as we know how if you are, if we do a really good job

3020
03:27:57.44 --> 03:28:02.32
of teaching or Marines and sailors how to treat casualties physically, if you're, if

3021
03:28:02.32 --> 03:28:04.32
you're routine, we know it's self-aid.

3022
03:28:04.32 --> 03:28:06.68
If you're a priority, it's buddy aid.

3023
03:28:06.68 --> 03:28:10.56
If you're urgent, it's got to get to higher echelon of care.

3024
03:28:10.56 --> 03:28:16.72
And so if you've got us a sucking chest wound, we say we got to get you to the dock.

3025
03:28:16.72 --> 03:28:19.04
We don't say just, Hey, you got a second chest wound.

3026
03:28:19.04 --> 03:28:21.24
You probably just patch this up and be okay.

3027
03:28:21.24 --> 03:28:22.64
No, we say we got it.

3028
03:28:22.64 --> 03:28:26.28
But what we don't do is say these invisible wounds.

3029
03:28:26.28 --> 03:28:27.28
Are you routine?

3030
03:28:27.28 --> 03:28:28.28
Are you priority or you're urgent?

3031
03:28:28.28 --> 03:28:34.68
And so, you know, if you're routine and you just having a bad day, that's normal.

3032
03:28:34.68 --> 03:28:39.36
It has sad day, funky day, whatever, and you just whatever, whatever you got to do, put

3033
03:28:39.36 --> 03:28:43.76
on the jockel podcast, go for a run, you know, you get out of it, you know, if you're priority,

3034
03:28:43.76 --> 03:28:44.76
you need some buddy aid.

3035
03:28:44.76 --> 03:28:47.92
Hey, I'm going through this thing, share it with your buddy, you know, your buddy can

3036
03:28:47.92 --> 03:28:52.08
kind of fire, fireman carry you out of that thing.

3037
03:28:52.08 --> 03:28:57.28
But sometime you got a sucking chest wound and talking to your buddy or or going for

3038
03:28:57.28 --> 03:29:02.36
a run is those are helpful, but they're not going to heal that wound.

3039
03:29:02.36 --> 03:29:11.20
And I've been bleeding for a long time, but I lacked the self awareness to be able to

3040
03:29:11.20 --> 03:29:14.04
triage that when I also lacked the ability to.

3041
03:29:14.04 --> 03:29:17.72
And so I needed to go to it just like if I had a suck chest when I want to go to a doctor,

3042
03:29:17.72 --> 03:29:18.88
I needed to go to a doctor.

3043
03:29:18.88 --> 03:29:32.32
And so, yeah, I, I, I finally went and and there's a CPT cognitive processing therapy.

3044
03:29:32.32 --> 03:29:40.20
I think it's called and, and what it does is it brings you to the traumatic event over

3045
03:29:40.20 --> 03:29:44.36
and over, which is a super dangerous thing to do by yourself.

3046
03:29:44.36 --> 03:29:49.84
You know, you can't, you don't, those are all volatile and you need a trained professional

3047
03:29:49.84 --> 03:29:55.36
to open up your sandbag and start to unpack and pull some of those things out.

3048
03:29:55.36 --> 03:30:02.88
And, and through like that repeated exposure, you, you start to kind of be able to negotiate

3049
03:30:02.88 --> 03:30:04.32
or navigate that.

3050
03:30:04.32 --> 03:30:14.40
And so my wife says, and I had to distrust her judgment that that was what saved me in

3051
03:30:14.40 --> 03:30:16.28
a lot of ways saved our marriage.

3052
03:30:16.28 --> 03:30:21.60
And so yeah, I, that, that was kind of how I ended up there.

3053
03:30:21.60 --> 03:30:23.72
And it was, it was, yeah, it was very helpful.

3054
03:30:23.72 --> 03:30:26.08
How often do you go?

3055
03:30:26.08 --> 03:30:30.96
Well I went for about nine months while I was at the Naval Academy.

3056
03:30:30.96 --> 03:30:37.96
And you know, you're supposed to do, I don't know, 12, 15, 20 sessions of this CPT.

3057
03:30:37.96 --> 03:30:42.36
And mine got a little truncated because I got orders to the Naval War College.

3058
03:30:42.36 --> 03:30:50.68
And I haven't been back, but it's at least to a point where it's, I'm not, I don't think

3059
03:30:50.68 --> 03:30:52.16
I'm an urgent couch to your right.

3060
03:30:52.16 --> 03:30:55.80
So I think, so probably so benefit from it.

3061
03:30:55.80 --> 03:30:57.52
But yeah.

3062
03:30:57.52 --> 03:31:01.72
And it's, it's one of those things where it's the self-delusion where you just say, I don't

3063
03:31:01.72 --> 03:31:02.72
have time for it.

3064
03:31:02.72 --> 03:31:03.80
I don't have time for it.

3065
03:31:03.80 --> 03:31:05.20
I got, I got Marine's lead.

3066
03:31:05.20 --> 03:31:11.44
I got, it's like, man, if you don't get to the root cause of some of the stuff that you're

3067
03:31:11.44 --> 03:31:18.80
doing, you're going to, so make it a priority.

3068
03:31:18.80 --> 03:31:23.52
And also mostly by the way, you're just scared of dealing with it.

3069
03:31:23.52 --> 03:31:27.96
And so you're making excuses cause you don't have the courage to deal with the tough stuff

3070
03:31:27.96 --> 03:31:29.16
that's going on inside you.

3071
03:31:29.16 --> 03:31:36.92
And so yeah, that's a, that was kind of my, my experience with all that.

3072
03:31:36.92 --> 03:31:44.68
You mentioned really quickly that you established a charity organization called Patrol-Based

3073
03:31:44.68 --> 03:31:48.08
Abate, PBabate.org.

3074
03:31:48.08 --> 03:31:51.28
That was in November, 2020.

3075
03:31:51.28 --> 03:31:52.68
What's the purpose behind that?

3076
03:31:52.68 --> 03:31:53.68
Yeah.

3077
03:31:53.68 --> 03:32:01.000
So I, I, I've always been like a person that if there's a problem, you should walk point.

3078
03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:05.96
Like you should try to figure out how you can contribute.

3079
03:32:05.96 --> 03:32:11.84
And I said, this suicide thing, whatever's, whatever we got going is, it seems to be not

3080
03:32:11.84 --> 03:32:14.20
working.

3081
03:32:14.20 --> 03:32:17.08
And so I said, let me go read all the VA suicide reports.

3082
03:32:17.08 --> 03:32:19.36
So I pulled up, you know, 10 years of VA suicide reports.

3083
03:32:19.36 --> 03:32:22.44
And what I kept coming back to is that the leading possible cause of veteran suicide

3084
03:32:22.44 --> 03:32:25.52
were feelings of disconnectness and isolation.

3085
03:32:25.52 --> 03:32:33.56
So that veterans who are disconnected or isolated are, are more vulnerable to, to suicide.

3086
03:32:33.56 --> 03:32:34.76
Okay.

3087
03:32:34.76 --> 03:32:40.04
And then there's a little stat that kept showing up that was really surprising and that there's

3088
03:32:40.04 --> 03:32:45.08
no correlation between combat and suicide and veterans.

3089
03:32:45.08 --> 03:32:49.24
And that people generally have a like, what really?

3090
03:32:49.24 --> 03:32:50.72
And that was my same reaction.

3091
03:32:50.72 --> 03:32:56.96
And, and, and, but as I thought and reflected on that, when you transition, the thing that

3092
03:32:56.96 --> 03:33:01.12
you're missing is that tribe and that purpose.

3093
03:33:01.12 --> 03:33:06.20
And you can find that in other ways, there's plenty of ways where you can find that tribe,

3094
03:33:06.20 --> 03:33:07.88
find that purpose again.

3095
03:33:07.88 --> 03:33:12.44
But it, not everybody's able to fall into or find that thing.

3096
03:33:12.44 --> 03:33:18.80
And I think when I think of a, an aircrew on a, on a C17 or C130, when I think of a

3097
03:33:18.80 --> 03:33:25.16
motor T crew or comp section, everybody in that unit has said, I'm willing to die for

3098
03:33:25.16 --> 03:33:26.72
you.

3099
03:33:26.72 --> 03:33:32.24
And everybody in that unit understands that, keep an aircraft flying is like, that's an

3100
03:33:32.24 --> 03:33:34.36
important, keeping trucks rolling.

3101
03:33:34.36 --> 03:33:35.36
Like that's important.

3102
03:33:35.36 --> 03:33:37.32
The ability to communicate important.

3103
03:33:37.32 --> 03:33:41.16
So everybody, when you look at a mission, a mission is a task and purpose.

3104
03:33:41.16 --> 03:33:46.000
And so the military quite literally issues you, a tribe, here's your squad, you're in

3105
03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.12
first squad.

3106
03:33:48.12 --> 03:33:51.56
And then they, and then they give you a mission, which, which actually has a purpose built

3107
03:33:51.56 --> 03:33:54.20
into the mission statement.

3108
03:33:54.20 --> 03:33:59.96
And so then as you transition, there's this identity crisis because over your left heart,

3109
03:33:59.96 --> 03:34:04.20
you've got a name tape that says Navy Marines, you know, and it's like, we just hand you

3110
03:34:04.20 --> 03:34:06.84
a piece of paper and say, you're not that thing.

3111
03:34:06.84 --> 03:34:13.44
You say, well, man, I still, I've been indoctrinated into this thing and there's not a process

3112
03:34:13.44 --> 03:34:18.24
of indoctrination in out of it.

3113
03:34:18.24 --> 03:34:24.08
And, and so I said, what is out there that is getting people, if, if isolation and disconnecting

3114
03:34:24.08 --> 03:34:29.16
this are the two big risk factors here, what is out there that's getting all veterans in

3115
03:34:29.16 --> 03:34:35.08
community and getting all veterans connected because it's, if it's not just a combat, a

3116
03:34:35.08 --> 03:34:36.76
veteran problem.

3117
03:34:36.76 --> 03:34:41.76
And what I found is that the overwhelming majority of veteran service organizations out there

3118
03:34:41.76 --> 03:34:48.36
and there were many are dedicated to supporting our special operations, our wounded and our

3119
03:34:48.36 --> 03:34:50.58
gold star families.

3120
03:34:50.58 --> 03:34:56.72
And I am so grateful that as an American that we recognize that people who have made the

3121
03:34:56.72 --> 03:35:01.20
most sacrifice are special or our Navy, our Navy Steel Foundation, our Green Beret Foundation.

3122
03:35:01.20 --> 03:35:05.04
Like I'm so happy that we said, these people have paid the most cost.

3123
03:35:05.04 --> 03:35:06.92
They've given a limb.

3124
03:35:06.92 --> 03:35:11.04
They've deployed seven, 10, 12 times, but special forces.

3125
03:35:11.04 --> 03:35:12.04
There are goals.

3126
03:35:12.04 --> 03:35:15.52
I'm happy that that's where we've resourced and put an invested in because these, these

3127
03:35:15.52 --> 03:35:18.92
people deserve it.

3128
03:35:18.92 --> 03:35:23.24
But what the data tells us is that there's, there's more to this picture.

3129
03:35:23.24 --> 03:35:30.28
And so I didn't find an organization at the time that I felt was inclusive or accessible

3130
03:35:30.28 --> 03:35:33.000
to everybody that's raised the right hand.

3131
03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:37.56
And I wanted, and there was always some kind of barrier to entry said, you know, you got

3132
03:35:37.56 --> 03:35:41.44
it, you don't, you're not disabled enough to be eligible.

3133
03:35:41.44 --> 03:35:43.80
You're not, you don't have enough of a disorder.

3134
03:35:43.80 --> 03:35:45.52
You haven't been to combat enough.

3135
03:35:45.52 --> 03:35:50.04
It's always this barrier or check this box, check this box.

3136
03:35:50.04 --> 03:35:53.44
And then, or they were like very reactive.

3137
03:35:53.44 --> 03:35:54.44
I've overdosed.

3138
03:35:54.44 --> 03:35:55.92
I've had a suicide attempt.

3139
03:35:55.92 --> 03:35:56.92
It was right of bang.

3140
03:35:56.92 --> 03:36:01.28
Now, now that you're right of bang and that you're in your moment of crisis, now you're

3141
03:36:01.28 --> 03:36:02.28
eligible.

3142
03:36:02.28 --> 03:36:06.16
So let's, let's preemptive was proactive was left of being in this.

3143
03:36:06.16 --> 03:36:08.60
And I didn't find a whole lot.

3144
03:36:08.60 --> 03:36:14.92
And I said, let's create a space where your service is your price of admission that, that

3145
03:36:14.92 --> 03:36:18.76
you don't, I can, I can check a lot of these boxes, by the way.

3146
03:36:18.76 --> 03:36:24.000
I don't want to be defined by disorder or by my disability or by, you know, I just want

3147
03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:29.28
to say, Hey, I'm Tom and I could use some community and I could use some connection.

3148
03:36:29.28 --> 03:36:34.44
So we went and we got 350 acres up in Montana.

3149
03:36:34.44 --> 03:36:38.68
And we said, we're going to do the things that you like to do veterans.

3150
03:36:38.68 --> 03:36:40.40
So what are the things that you want to do?

3151
03:36:40.40 --> 03:36:42.88
Well, let's build around a shared common interest.

3152
03:36:42.88 --> 03:36:44.68
So we've got a fight club that does Jiu Jitsu.

3153
03:36:44.68 --> 03:36:46.96
We've got a strength club that does powerlifting.

3154
03:36:46.96 --> 03:36:49.28
We've got a music club that's been up there.

3155
03:36:49.28 --> 03:36:50.48
We've got an art club that's been up there.

3156
03:36:50.48 --> 03:36:51.60
We've got a book club that's been up there.

3157
03:36:51.60 --> 03:36:53.72
We've got a hunting club that's been up there.

3158
03:36:53.72 --> 03:36:58.72
And so a lot of these organizations are predicated around fishing, for example.

3159
03:36:58.72 --> 03:37:00.96
And I think that's really good.

3160
03:37:00.96 --> 03:37:03.44
A lot of healing could happen during that.

3161
03:37:03.44 --> 03:37:06.24
Not everybody is into fishing, you know?

3162
03:37:06.24 --> 03:37:12.08
And so like, and so we want to say, I want to say, Hey, if it was up to me, I'm a grunt

3163
03:37:12.08 --> 03:37:13.08
who likes to read.

3164
03:37:13.08 --> 03:37:14.64
So like, I like to hike and I like to read books.

3165
03:37:14.64 --> 03:37:18.96
And so like, I would just have PBBate be like the hiking book club.

3166
03:37:18.96 --> 03:37:20.68
But that's not everybody's thing.

3167
03:37:20.68 --> 03:37:26.76
And so we want to say whatever you're into, if you're willing to walk point, we'll resource

3168
03:37:26.76 --> 03:37:29.32
to you and we'll build a club or club around you.

3169
03:37:29.32 --> 03:37:34.64
And so, and we're going to and we're going to fly you up to where our dojo is, it's on

3170
03:37:34.64 --> 03:37:37.48
the side of a mountain in a Montana River Valley.

3171
03:37:37.48 --> 03:37:41.84
There's no more beautiful dojo in the world to roll than on the side of that mountain,

3172
03:37:41.84 --> 03:37:42.84
the PBBate.

3173
03:37:42.84 --> 03:37:50.16
There's no better place to lift weights or and so and we fly you out for your cost.

3174
03:37:50.16 --> 03:37:55.04
We pick you up, we feed you all for your cost because it's all this idea of so many veterans,

3175
03:37:55.04 --> 03:37:59.80
especially GWOT veterans or post-911 veterans are conditioned this thing where, well, I

3176
03:37:59.80 --> 03:38:06.000
was just a and they use this just and we've we've really, I think largely through social

3177
03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:10.04
media constructed this hierarchy of what it means to serve.

3178
03:38:10.04 --> 03:38:15.28
And if you weren't in Ramadi or if you weren't part of this organization or you like, and

3179
03:38:15.28 --> 03:38:20.44
it's this weird competition of in this redefinition, redefining of what service means.

3180
03:38:20.44 --> 03:38:24.000
It's like, no, service means you raise your right hand, you sworn out to the Constitution,

3181
03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:26.16
you did that for four years and honorably.

3182
03:38:26.16 --> 03:38:29.04
That is what services by definition.

3183
03:38:29.04 --> 03:38:33.64
And so you serve something greater than yourself.

3184
03:38:33.64 --> 03:38:37.64
And so we want the airmen, the sailor, the soldier, the Marine, the National Guard, the

3185
03:38:37.64 --> 03:38:40.20
reservists, active duty PFC.

3186
03:38:40.20 --> 03:38:44.52
If you raise your right hand, you're eligible and you're in no additional call.

3187
03:38:44.52 --> 03:38:48.80
And like many people when we would say this, they'd be like, wait, me?

3188
03:38:48.80 --> 03:38:51.08
I'm just an airman.

3189
03:38:51.08 --> 03:38:52.28
I'm just a motor tease.

3190
03:38:52.28 --> 03:38:55.68
Nope, we actually built this place for you.

3191
03:38:55.68 --> 03:38:57.84
For me, well, I would go, but I can't afford it.

3192
03:38:57.84 --> 03:38:59.48
It's like, oh, good, because it's free cost.

3193
03:38:59.48 --> 03:39:01.44
Oh, I would go, but like, I don't do that.

3194
03:39:01.44 --> 03:39:02.44
It's like, what do you do?

3195
03:39:02.44 --> 03:39:04.68
Well, let's go do that thing.

3196
03:39:04.68 --> 03:39:09.80
And so we've run two, we call it the return to base program.

3197
03:39:09.80 --> 03:39:12.60
We've run two summers of it.

3198
03:39:12.60 --> 03:39:17.92
And you know, the pillars are getting around the fire because I really think that connection

3199
03:39:17.92 --> 03:39:21.08
forms around the fireside chats.

3200
03:39:21.08 --> 03:39:24.72
Getting out in nature because I think I believe good things happen outside and then getting

3201
03:39:24.72 --> 03:39:25.88
back into service.

3202
03:39:25.88 --> 03:39:28.80
And so we do a service project around there.

3203
03:39:28.80 --> 03:39:31.04
And then we sustain that through local chapters.

3204
03:39:31.04 --> 03:39:36.96
And so we just say like, what sandbag do you want to fill?

3205
03:39:36.96 --> 03:39:41.62
We need somebody to walk point and we created this space for you.

3206
03:39:41.62 --> 03:39:42.80
And we got a big tent.

3207
03:39:42.80 --> 03:39:43.92
We got to see if we get the table.

3208
03:39:43.92 --> 03:39:46.12
Come on, get in community, get connected.

3209
03:39:46.12 --> 03:39:47.24
And that's what we've been doing.

3210
03:39:47.24 --> 03:39:50.12
And it's been pretty incredible to be a part of it.

3211
03:39:50.12 --> 03:39:53.000
How many people have you put through in the two summers?

3212
03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.44
About 150 people up to Montana.

3213
03:39:56.44 --> 03:39:59.72
And then we're still running another program this fall.

3214
03:39:59.72 --> 03:40:04.32
And you know, if we can't do the thing that you do on the side of a mountain, I'll find

3215
03:40:04.32 --> 03:40:05.84
a way to support you.

3216
03:40:05.84 --> 03:40:09.76
So somebody said, hey, I'm in the scuba diving.

3217
03:40:09.76 --> 03:40:11.40
Can't scuba dive on the side of the mountain.

3218
03:40:11.40 --> 03:40:12.40
So okay.

3219
03:40:12.40 --> 03:40:16.08
So I found a partner down in the Bahamas and we're going to send 15 veterans out in October.

3220
03:40:16.08 --> 03:40:22.76
And so about 150, but people who have been through our local chapter programs, I mean,

3221
03:40:22.76 --> 03:40:23.76
thousands, right?

3222
03:40:23.76 --> 03:40:29.56
And so every month all around this country, you've got PBBate, New York, Boston, Orange

3223
03:40:29.56 --> 03:40:35.04
County, San Diego, Austin meeting and getting into community and getting connected.

3224
03:40:35.04 --> 03:40:40.44
And so it's been pretty awesome to watch it grow.

3225
03:40:40.44 --> 03:40:42.96
And yeah.

3226
03:40:42.96 --> 03:40:43.96
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

3227
03:40:43.96 --> 03:40:48.12
And if people want to support it, they go to PBBate.org to support it.

3228
03:40:48.12 --> 03:40:50.52
That's the best way.

3229
03:40:50.52 --> 03:40:56.48
So get trying to try to follow the book a little bit here by summer of 2021.

3230
03:40:56.48 --> 03:41:05.12
Meanwhile, while this is going on, Zach and his world is falling apart in Afghanistan.

3231
03:41:05.12 --> 03:41:09.36
The Taliban is taking over.

3232
03:41:09.36 --> 03:41:10.36
Time is short.

3233
03:41:10.36 --> 03:41:12.96
Again, you detail a lot of stuff in the book.

3234
03:41:12.96 --> 03:41:21.36
And you go into like full combat mode, but administrative effort to get Zach and his

3235
03:41:21.36 --> 03:41:25.80
family out of there.

3236
03:41:25.80 --> 03:41:26.80
And you're going down.

3237
03:41:26.80 --> 03:41:30.40
I mean, you're just you're taking everything you can possibly do to get this done.

3238
03:41:30.40 --> 03:41:38.76
Social media fundraising, senior military leaders, politicians to try and get something

3239
03:41:38.76 --> 03:41:41.000
going to get him out of there.

3240
03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:45.20
And of course, this is no small task because at the time there's a tens of thousands of

3241
03:41:45.20 --> 03:41:51.44
other people that are also trying to get out of Afghanistan as all of this stuff as it

3242
03:41:51.44 --> 03:41:54.68
starts to fall apart.

3243
03:41:54.68 --> 03:41:58.04
And just to give a little bit of Zach's perspective here.

3244
03:41:58.04 --> 03:42:00.56
And again, I'm fast forward.

3245
03:42:00.56 --> 03:42:02.20
There's so much, so much more detail in the book.

3246
03:42:02.20 --> 03:42:04.48
Get the book.

3247
03:42:04.48 --> 03:42:09.28
This is from Zach on July 16, 2021, when Tom told me I needed to get to Kabul and explained

3248
03:42:09.28 --> 03:42:12.24
why I had to stop and sit for a moment.

3249
03:42:12.24 --> 03:42:17.88
I was relieved that more people than just Tom and I cared about the survival of my family,

3250
03:42:17.88 --> 03:42:19.76
but I knew chaos was coming.

3251
03:42:19.76 --> 03:42:22.48
I just needed it to be still before it began.

3252
03:42:22.48 --> 03:42:25.02
I just needed to be still before it began.

3253
03:42:25.02 --> 03:42:29.84
Even when you've been planning for it, the thought of leaving your home forever is overwhelming.

3254
03:42:29.84 --> 03:42:34.000
How do you say goodbye to your family members when you know you may never see them again?

3255
03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:36.40
How do you kiss your mother for the last time?

3256
03:42:36.40 --> 03:42:40.64
How do you keep from forgetting the smell of her hair after you do?

3257
03:42:40.64 --> 03:42:45.44
I sat on the terrace of our home where so many of the simple things at the center of

3258
03:42:45.44 --> 03:42:46.92
my life had happened.

3259
03:42:46.92 --> 03:42:49.88
Childhood, marriage, my children taking their first steps.

3260
03:42:49.88 --> 03:42:53.76
They were moments as tied to a place as I was.

3261
03:42:53.76 --> 03:42:58.04
Now I was being forced to leave them behind with my home.

3262
03:42:58.04 --> 03:43:02.48
For all my sadness, there was no hiding from the situation.

3263
03:43:02.48 --> 03:43:06.36
Life for regular Afghans was bad and getting steadily worse.

3264
03:43:06.36 --> 03:43:07.88
I was living in hiding.

3265
03:43:07.88 --> 03:43:12.32
The Taliban's messages, which had long made it clear they were looking for me and would

3266
03:43:12.32 --> 03:43:16.32
kill me for working with the Americans when they found me, were growing bolder and coming

3267
03:43:16.32 --> 03:43:17.68
more often.

3268
03:43:17.68 --> 03:43:19.44
I could not live in Kunar.

3269
03:43:19.44 --> 03:43:21.12
I could not survive there.

3270
03:43:21.12 --> 03:43:24.36
More importantly, my family could not.

3271
03:43:24.36 --> 03:43:30.000
When I learned that the Americans left Bagram in the middle of the night on July 2nd, I

3272
03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:32.60
thought about my own times flying in and out of there.

3273
03:43:32.60 --> 03:43:37.20
I remembered how the air base felt like it could not contain all the planes and helicopters.

3274
03:43:37.20 --> 03:43:41.64
It seemed like America's power was without end.

3275
03:43:41.64 --> 03:43:44.40
I had placed my faith in that.

3276
03:43:44.40 --> 03:43:49.24
I did not see then how the Americans and our government would ever let the Taliban come

3277
03:43:49.24 --> 03:43:51.52
back.

3278
03:43:51.52 --> 03:43:58.88
But here the Taliban were leaving me messages at my family's doorstep during the night.

3279
03:43:58.88 --> 03:44:05.24
So, it was just awful for him.

3280
03:44:05.24 --> 03:44:14.04
At this point, the book kind of turns into a suspense, espionage, spy political thriller.

3281
03:44:14.04 --> 03:44:16.76
It's mayhem, but it's not a novel.

3282
03:44:16.76 --> 03:44:22.60
It's what's really going on and what's really happening to this real person and this real

3283
03:44:22.60 --> 03:44:25.12
family.

3284
03:44:25.12 --> 03:44:30.76
Something that's cool is the way the book is set up, it's telling it both from your

3285
03:44:30.76 --> 03:44:34.20
perspective and then you hear his perspective and then you hear his perspective and you

3286
03:44:34.20 --> 03:44:40.72
hear your perspective as you're trying to coordinate this movement and link-ups and

3287
03:44:40.72 --> 03:44:48.08
bona fides and messages and dying batteries on cell phones.

3288
03:44:48.08 --> 03:44:52.12
Which you think, you know, when you're in a first world problem, you know, oh no, my

3289
03:44:52.12 --> 03:44:55.76
cell phone died and I'm not going to be able to get a message until I get to my car and

3290
03:44:55.76 --> 03:44:59.000
get it charged, right?

3291
03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:04.64
You know, he's out there, his batteries low and he's literally standing at the wall trying

3292
03:45:04.64 --> 03:45:08.80
to make comms.

3293
03:45:08.80 --> 03:45:16.24
It's a crazy scene and again, we all, I mean, everybody watched this on the news, but to

3294
03:45:16.24 --> 03:45:21.44
hear somebody that was on the ground, their perspective as they're trying to escape, this

3295
03:45:21.44 --> 03:45:24.36
is Zach again at the airport wall.

3296
03:45:24.36 --> 03:45:29.12
So he's at the wall trying to get into the airport.

3297
03:45:29.12 --> 03:45:33.76
A Taliban fighter stood closer to the wall and was watching the crowd and AK-47 hanging

3298
03:45:33.76 --> 03:45:35.64
across his chest.

3299
03:45:35.64 --> 03:45:38.70
He saw us looking up at the American on the tower roof.

3300
03:45:38.70 --> 03:45:41.84
He looked in the same direction and reached out to alert his friends.

3301
03:45:41.84 --> 03:45:44.12
I saw him look up at the American again.

3302
03:45:44.12 --> 03:45:47.32
I could tell they made eye contact with each other.

3303
03:45:47.32 --> 03:45:51.36
The Taliban put his pistol, put his hand on his pistol grip of his AK.

3304
03:45:51.36 --> 03:45:56.24
The American reached towards his hip, but another American standing on a half wall below

3305
03:45:56.24 --> 03:45:57.96
him, reached out to grab his leg.

3306
03:45:57.96 --> 03:46:00.56
He shook his head, no.

3307
03:46:00.56 --> 03:46:03.36
And the one on the tower moved his hand away from his hip.

3308
03:46:03.36 --> 03:46:08.28
The Taliban below made their hands into the shape of pistols and pointed them at the American

3309
03:46:08.28 --> 03:46:12.44
as he carefully climbed down and stepped back over the wire.

3310
03:46:12.44 --> 03:46:14.12
I kept my eyes focused on him.

3311
03:46:14.12 --> 03:46:16.000
I could not see his face.

3312
03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:19.24
I did not know if it was Major Jared LeFever.

3313
03:46:19.24 --> 03:46:20.88
Is that right LeFever?

3314
03:46:20.88 --> 03:46:25.24
Major Jared LeFever, but I felt in my heart that this was the moment.

3315
03:46:25.24 --> 03:46:29.20
Then I saw him lift his hand to his mouth and speak into a phone.

3316
03:46:29.20 --> 03:46:34.88
A message arrived on my own in the group chat with Tom and Jared.

3317
03:46:34.88 --> 03:46:39.36
The text said, put your son on your shoulder.

3318
03:46:39.36 --> 03:46:44.12
I lifted my son over his head, over the shouting, sweating, mass of people.

3319
03:46:44.12 --> 03:46:49.92
He was wearing a bright blue shirt as John Shattuck had told me to have him do early

3320
03:46:49.92 --> 03:46:51.36
that morning.

3321
03:46:51.36 --> 03:46:52.92
The American waved me closer.

3322
03:46:52.92 --> 03:46:57.08
I grabbed my family and we fought through the crowd to the base of the wall with our

3323
03:46:57.08 --> 03:46:59.28
new friend following.

3324
03:46:59.28 --> 03:47:06.12
As we pushed my countrymen aside, I was nodding at the man I knew now as Major LeFever.

3325
03:47:06.12 --> 03:47:07.96
He shouted to me, do you have your family?

3326
03:47:07.96 --> 03:47:10.56
Yes, I yelled back and one more.

3327
03:47:10.56 --> 03:47:14.60
Major LeFever turned to the three Americans next to him, all large men and heavily armed.

3328
03:47:14.60 --> 03:47:17.80
I could not hear them all talking, but from their gesture I could tell they were trying

3329
03:47:17.80 --> 03:47:21.12
to decide how to pull seven people up and over the wall.

3330
03:47:21.12 --> 03:47:25.000
They began to attract attention from more of the Taliban.

3331
03:47:25.000 --> 03:47:27.80
Drowning people will reach for any hand they see.

3332
03:47:27.80 --> 03:47:31.52
The crowd was beginning to move toward the base of the wall below where they stood.

3333
03:47:31.52 --> 03:47:35.04
The Americans finished conferring and began to move.

3334
03:47:35.04 --> 03:47:40.32
My eyes were locked on Major LeFever as he sent me a text.

3335
03:47:40.32 --> 03:47:51.44
We have to figure out how to get you to us at the door to your left.

3336
03:47:51.44 --> 03:47:53.96
That's the way this book goes.

3337
03:47:53.96 --> 03:48:02.72
Reading through this, it's agonizing and you just don't know how this is going to end,

3338
03:48:02.72 --> 03:48:10.16
other than the fact that the title of the book indicates that we have to keep the faith.

3339
03:48:10.16 --> 03:48:11.16
We have to keep the faith.

3340
03:48:11.16 --> 03:48:19.16
Zack keeps the faith and ultimately the servicemen and women on the ground remain faithful.

3341
03:48:19.16 --> 03:48:25.56
And Zack does get through all kinds of gates and wickets to get him and his family out

3342
03:48:25.56 --> 03:48:28.48
of there.

3343
03:48:28.48 --> 03:48:35.72
Gets out before the attack at Abbey Gate, which happened a few days after he left where

3344
03:48:35.72 --> 03:48:44.84
we lost one US Army soldier, one US Navy corpsman and 11 United States Marines.

3345
03:48:44.84 --> 03:48:50.24
Perhaps the last to die for that particular cause and that particular nation by that particular

3346
03:48:50.24 --> 03:48:55.84
enemy or perhaps not.

3347
03:48:55.84 --> 03:48:58.88
Only time will tell.

3348
03:48:58.88 --> 03:49:07.84
But Zack made it out and made it to America and I mean, it's very powerful.

3349
03:49:07.84 --> 03:49:13.000
It's very powerful to hear his perspective.

3350
03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:17.32
Let me just give you a little bit of that.

3351
03:49:17.32 --> 03:49:18.44
This is when he's back.

3352
03:49:18.44 --> 03:49:22.04
I was willing to risk my life.

3353
03:49:22.04 --> 03:49:24.60
Thousands of my fellow Afghans lost theirs.

3354
03:49:24.60 --> 03:49:30.20
I worked for my people and country in pursuit of a better future for all of us.

3355
03:49:30.20 --> 03:49:35.48
But I also worked with and for the Americans because they came to help us build a better

3356
03:49:35.48 --> 03:49:37.000
Afghanistan.

3357
03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:38.80
I would do it again.

3358
03:49:38.80 --> 03:49:44.12
I would still sacrifice myself for my country, for my people and for America, the country

3359
03:49:44.12 --> 03:49:48.44
that saved and welcomed me and my family.

3360
03:49:48.44 --> 03:49:55.000
Too many good people died for a dream for me to ignore the obligation to pay it back.

3361
03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:58.68
The Taliban were not our only problem.

3362
03:49:58.68 --> 03:50:05.92
The corruption in our own national government was a chain around our collective necks.

3363
03:50:05.92 --> 03:50:10.32
Leaders must earn their positions by deserving the trust of the people.

3364
03:50:10.32 --> 03:50:15.000
A government with anything less will never survive and the governed will never thrive.

3365
03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:19.64
Too many of our leaders bought their way into power as a means of enriching themselves.

3366
03:50:19.64 --> 03:50:24.60
Too many warlords held on to power by force, placing themselves ahead of the people they

3367
03:50:24.60 --> 03:50:26.12
were supposed to protect.

3368
03:50:26.12 --> 03:50:34.04
It was a frail system that fell when the foreign support holding it up ceased to exist.

3369
03:50:34.04 --> 03:50:36.80
For now, the Taliban own Afghanistan.

3370
03:50:36.80 --> 03:50:41.68
The Afghan people are again living in a nightmare.

3371
03:50:41.68 --> 03:50:44.44
People I love who are still there are suffering.

3372
03:50:44.44 --> 03:50:49.88
They are starving with no food and no money with which to buy it.

3373
03:50:49.88 --> 03:50:53.24
Modern medical care is already only a memory.

3374
03:50:53.24 --> 03:50:55.84
Security and freedom are a dream.

3375
03:50:55.84 --> 03:51:00.96
When they seize the nation, the Taliban claim that former members of the security forces

3376
03:51:00.96 --> 03:51:05.52
and people who worked with the Americans would be safe in a Taliban regime.

3377
03:51:05.52 --> 03:51:10.02
It was a lie then and it is a lie now.

3378
03:51:10.02 --> 03:51:14.04
The executions and torture have already begun.

3379
03:51:14.04 --> 03:51:17.24
I knew that was coming.

3380
03:51:17.24 --> 03:51:31.52
The Taliban told me themselves.

3381
03:51:31.52 --> 03:51:36.76
And you know those statements about Afghanistan and the leadership really apply anywhere and

3382
03:51:36.76 --> 03:51:39.48
corruption and nepotism and arrogance and power.

3383
03:51:39.48 --> 03:51:47.48
Where hungry leaders are the downfall of any organization, any team, any company, and any

3384
03:51:47.48 --> 03:51:50.56
country.

3385
03:51:50.56 --> 03:52:00.56
And we have to definitely be aware of that ourselves and pay attention.

3386
03:52:00.56 --> 03:52:04.04
When was the first time you saw Zach when he got to America?

3387
03:52:04.04 --> 03:52:07.64
I flew out to Minnesota to see him.

3388
03:52:07.64 --> 03:52:12.84
He had been in a refugee camp in Virginia, I think it was Fort Pickett for a while.

3389
03:52:12.84 --> 03:52:15.88
And kind of tough to get down there and get into the camp.

3390
03:52:15.88 --> 03:52:20.12
And so he had been maintaining all along that he wanted to go to Texas because his cousins

3391
03:52:20.12 --> 03:52:23.000
were there and important to assimilate with family.

3392
03:52:23.000 --> 03:52:25.48
His cousins had also been interpreter and got here a couple of years ago.

3393
03:52:25.48 --> 03:52:30.000
And so he was under the impression that he would get to Texas until about 24 hours.

3394
03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:39.24
Because you go to Minnesota tomorrow in January and Minneapolis in January is not Texas.

3395
03:52:39.24 --> 03:52:42.76
And so he was in a kind of bad spot.

3396
03:52:42.76 --> 03:52:45.92
And so I flew up there, got to see him, got to see his family.

3397
03:52:45.92 --> 03:52:50.48
And then he had been waiting for like a work permit.

3398
03:52:50.48 --> 03:52:56.000
And it's better if you stay within the resettlement process because if you pull out of the resettlement

3399
03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:59.98
process you kind of get reset back to zero.

3400
03:52:59.98 --> 03:53:03.92
And he had just received that work permit about the day or two before I showed up to

3401
03:53:03.92 --> 03:53:06.04
Minnesota and he told me, I got my work permit.

3402
03:53:06.04 --> 03:53:08.72
I said, do you need to be in Minnesota?

3403
03:53:08.72 --> 03:53:09.72
He said, no.

3404
03:53:09.72 --> 03:53:12.76
And I said, let's go to Texas.

3405
03:53:12.76 --> 03:53:14.52
So the next day we were on a flight.

3406
03:53:14.52 --> 03:53:16.20
What was it?

3407
03:53:16.20 --> 03:53:20.16
Seven passengers, eight bags, four car seats with a layover in Denver.

3408
03:53:20.16 --> 03:53:24.36
But we landed in San Antonio that night.

3409
03:53:24.36 --> 03:53:29.72
And it was good to see the mission through.

3410
03:53:29.72 --> 03:53:32.88
And what's he up to right now?

3411
03:53:32.88 --> 03:53:37.52
He works construction, hanging drywall at a cancer hospital six days a week, 12 hours

3412
03:53:37.52 --> 03:53:38.52
a day.

3413
03:53:38.52 --> 03:53:42.44
And he just, but he just had a son while we were in New York together.

3414
03:53:42.44 --> 03:53:43.80
So two weeks ago he had a son.

3415
03:53:43.80 --> 03:53:51.56
And so now Sejaad is his fifth kid and American by birth.

3416
03:53:51.56 --> 03:54:00.08
I've been having some great conversations with the Vietnam guys and some Vietnamese

3417
03:54:00.08 --> 03:54:09.72
that came over, you know, after the war and just their work ethic and what they instilled

3418
03:54:09.72 --> 03:54:13.48
in their kids is just amazing.

3419
03:54:13.48 --> 03:54:19.80
And you know, when you even hear about Zach like hanging drywall 12 hours a day, it's

3420
03:54:19.80 --> 03:54:23.40
like this guy's going to make something happen.

3421
03:54:23.40 --> 03:54:26.64
He is going to make something happen.

3422
03:54:26.64 --> 03:54:37.12
Just an awesome story of, you know, just the unceasing faith that you two had in each other

3423
03:54:37.12 --> 03:54:41.08
to make this happen.

3424
03:54:41.08 --> 03:54:44.40
So where are you at now?

3425
03:54:44.40 --> 03:54:46.16
I'm back at three five.

3426
03:54:46.16 --> 03:54:47.64
Get some.

3427
03:54:47.64 --> 03:54:49.68
Get some is their legit model, right?

3428
03:54:49.68 --> 03:54:54.68
I tried to research where that came from when they start saying that in Iraq is where it

3429
03:54:54.68 --> 03:54:55.68
check.

3430
03:54:55.68 --> 03:55:00.48
So they were they were in Phantom Fury, Al-Fajr.

3431
03:55:00.48 --> 03:55:07.60
And and so yeah, I'm dark horse three and I'm the operations officer for three five.

3432
03:55:07.60 --> 03:55:13.28
So we're training and getting ready to deploy next summer.

3433
03:55:13.28 --> 03:55:14.28
You deploy next summer.

3434
03:55:14.28 --> 03:55:15.96
Any idea where you guys are going?

3435
03:55:15.96 --> 03:55:17.16
Pacific A.O.

3436
03:55:17.16 --> 03:55:18.24
Pacific A.O.

3437
03:55:18.24 --> 03:55:19.24
Get some.

3438
03:55:19.24 --> 03:55:26.12
I guess that kind of brings us up to present day, right?

3439
03:55:26.12 --> 03:55:27.84
Probably a pretty good place to wrap it up.

3440
03:55:27.84 --> 03:55:30.68
I know you got some Marines to go lead.

3441
03:55:30.68 --> 03:55:31.68
What do we miss?

3442
03:55:31.68 --> 03:55:35.88
No, I think we got it for people to for people to find you.

3443
03:55:35.88 --> 03:55:40.12
First of all, the book, always faithful.

3444
03:55:40.12 --> 03:55:42.04
It's available anywhere.

3445
03:55:42.04 --> 03:55:43.92
Order it will put a link to it.

3446
03:55:43.92 --> 03:55:44.92
Right?

3447
03:55:44.92 --> 03:55:45.92
Echo Charles.

3448
03:55:45.92 --> 03:55:46.92
Yes, sir.

3449
03:55:46.92 --> 03:55:47.92
We will.

3450
03:55:47.92 --> 03:55:48.92
We collectively will do that.

3451
03:55:48.92 --> 03:55:53.32
Get it and get it.

3452
03:55:53.32 --> 03:55:55.12
Patrol base of Botte.

3453
03:55:55.12 --> 03:56:00.12
That's your your organization.

3454
03:56:00.12 --> 03:56:01.72
Go and check that out.

3455
03:56:01.72 --> 03:56:03.04
PbBotte.org.

3456
03:56:03.04 --> 03:56:10.32
I found like a kick ass a little video of Sergeant Abate to it's like 30 seconds long.

3457
03:56:10.32 --> 03:56:14.60
I don't know if there's any more video if there is, please let me know.

3458
03:56:14.60 --> 03:56:21.56
You could just tell he's just like like whatever percentage of charisma or whatever percentage

3459
03:56:21.56 --> 03:56:24.80
of just being a bad ass.

3460
03:56:24.80 --> 03:56:27.24
It's freaking legit.

3461
03:56:27.24 --> 03:56:29.04
You're on Instagram.

3462
03:56:29.04 --> 03:56:35.16
You are at kill dot zone, but it's spelled funny.

3463
03:56:35.16 --> 03:56:36.64
Z zero.

3464
03:56:36.64 --> 03:56:42.72
So it's Z and then a zero and then an N and then a three.

3465
03:56:42.72 --> 03:56:48.56
So at kill zone is where you're at on Instagram.

3466
03:56:48.56 --> 03:56:49.80
Echo Charles, you got any questions?

3467
03:56:49.80 --> 03:56:50.80
Yeah.

3468
03:56:50.80 --> 03:56:53.52
How'd you crash your motorcycle back in the day?

3469
03:56:53.52 --> 03:56:56.48
I crashed it twice.

3470
03:56:56.48 --> 03:57:01.48
Your mom really hates it because I try to go too fast too soon.

3471
03:57:01.48 --> 03:57:07.76
And so I lost my thumb and that's when I kind of retired from just sort of randomly or was

3472
03:57:07.76 --> 03:57:13.12
it like a very specific incident where you made some wrong decisions.

3473
03:57:13.12 --> 03:57:16.48
Too fast at a turn and laid it down.

3474
03:57:16.48 --> 03:57:20.88
Everyone that I know that has a motorcycle or had a motorcycle has crashed in varying

3475
03:57:20.88 --> 03:57:22.84
levels of injury or whatever.

3476
03:57:22.84 --> 03:57:24.64
So that's kind of the thing.

3477
03:57:24.64 --> 03:57:25.64
Yes.

3478
03:57:25.64 --> 03:57:27.88
I like, you know, I mentioned Mark Lee like the gamble.

3479
03:57:27.88 --> 03:57:29.52
I like to gamble.

3480
03:57:29.52 --> 03:57:36.48
And man, the odds when you're riding a motorcycle, the odds are just not your favor for being

3481
03:57:36.48 --> 03:57:40.52
okay when, when whatever happens happens and it's happening.

3482
03:57:40.52 --> 03:57:41.52
Oh yeah.

3483
03:57:41.52 --> 03:57:45.88
That's what it, I mean, I don't know every single person in the world with a motorcycle,

3484
03:57:45.88 --> 03:57:50.68
but every single person that I know that had a motorcycle crash, including myself, by the

3485
03:57:50.68 --> 03:57:51.68
way.

3486
03:57:51.68 --> 03:57:52.68
And I didn't even own the motorcycle.

3487
03:57:52.68 --> 03:57:55.000
I had my friend's motorcycle for the summer.

3488
03:57:55.000 --> 03:57:56.000
I laid it down.

3489
03:57:56.000 --> 03:57:58.08
So it's like, but you didn't get injured.

3490
03:57:58.08 --> 03:58:00.40
When was that college?

3491
03:58:00.40 --> 03:58:01.72
But you didn't get injured.

3492
03:58:01.72 --> 03:58:04.72
No, I handled, but I still understood.

3493
03:58:04.72 --> 03:58:05.72
What kind of bike did you have?

3494
03:58:05.72 --> 03:58:06.72
Did you have a super bike?

3495
03:58:06.72 --> 03:58:07.72
If you have a Harley?

3496
03:58:07.72 --> 03:58:09.60
I had a, my first bike was a victory.

3497
03:58:09.60 --> 03:58:11.88
And then my second bike was a Ducati.

3498
03:58:11.88 --> 03:58:12.88
Okay.

3499
03:58:12.88 --> 03:58:13.88
Yeah.

3500
03:58:13.88 --> 03:58:14.88
That Ducati gets way tempting, doesn't it?

3501
03:58:14.88 --> 03:58:16.88
I mean, that thing just wants you to roll.

3502
03:58:16.88 --> 03:58:17.88
Yeah.

3503
03:58:17.88 --> 03:58:20.20
It's almost like one of those inevitable slippery slopes.

3504
03:58:20.20 --> 03:58:21.20
Well, crack me.

3505
03:58:21.20 --> 03:58:22.20
I don't know.

3506
03:58:22.20 --> 03:58:27.80
Everybody's different to a degree where you go fast and you're like, you kind of feel

3507
03:58:27.80 --> 03:58:30.44
the power a little bit, but you don't want to push it.

3508
03:58:30.44 --> 03:58:31.44
And then you kind of get coming.

3509
03:58:31.44 --> 03:58:32.44
You're like, I can't go faster.

3510
03:58:32.44 --> 03:58:33.44
I can't go fast.

3511
03:58:33.44 --> 03:58:34.44
And it just never stops.

3512
03:58:34.44 --> 03:58:35.44
Right?

3513
03:58:35.44 --> 03:58:39.44
And then I move through that progression very rapidly.

3514
03:58:39.44 --> 03:58:45.20
Well, we're going to, um, we're going to support your mom on the anti-motorcycle cake

3515
03:58:45.20 --> 03:58:46.20
here.

3516
03:58:46.20 --> 03:58:47.20
Fair enough.

3517
03:58:47.20 --> 03:58:48.60
Tom, any final thoughts?

3518
03:58:48.60 --> 03:58:50.04
No, sir.

3519
03:58:50.04 --> 03:58:53.96
Well, thanks for joining us today.

3520
03:58:53.96 --> 03:58:55.56
Thanks for sharing your lessons.

3521
03:58:55.56 --> 03:59:00.28
Thanks for your continued service with the Marine Corps.

3522
03:59:00.28 --> 03:59:04.88
And thanks for keeping the faith with your interpreter, Zach, who never let you down

3523
03:59:04.88 --> 03:59:10.92
in the field and you did not let down when he and his family needed you.

3524
03:59:10.92 --> 03:59:18.88
And, uh, to everyone out there right now that's still holding the line, I recommend we remember

3525
03:59:18.88 --> 03:59:22.56
the guidance from Sergeant Matt Abbate.

3526
03:59:22.56 --> 03:59:28.92
In any situation, thou shall blaze.

3527
03:59:28.92 --> 03:59:33.20
Nothing matters more than thy brethren to thy left and right.

3528
03:59:33.20 --> 03:59:43.76
Thou shall protect no matter what until the body runs dry of blood.

3529
03:59:43.76 --> 03:59:44.76
Thanks Tom.

3530
03:59:44.76 --> 03:59:46.64
Thank you.

3531
03:59:46.64 --> 03:59:49.64
And with that, Tom Schumann has left the building.

3532
03:59:49.64 --> 03:59:50.64
Echo.

3533
03:59:50.64 --> 03:59:51.64
Hmm.

3534
03:59:51.64 --> 03:59:57.08
I would say, you know, when you, when you reflect on just talking about Tom's first

3535
03:59:57.08 --> 04:00:02.64
deployment, you know, he's a platoon commander, it's just so much responsibility.

3536
04:00:02.64 --> 04:00:04.20
And that's what's, that's what's good.

3537
04:00:04.20 --> 04:00:09.32
If you know, if you, if you've been in the military, you've, you've, you've had so much

3538
04:00:09.32 --> 04:00:14.44
responsibility that for people in the civilian sector out there, you hire someone to run

3539
04:00:14.44 --> 04:00:19.68
a branch or run a manufacturing facility and they've had this much weight.

3540
04:00:19.68 --> 04:00:24.64
Um, there's a really good chance that they're going to have some good lessons learned and

3541
04:00:24.64 --> 04:00:26.000
being able to do a good job.

3542
04:00:26.000 --> 04:00:33.56
It's just a lot of weight is on the shoulders of these young, young soldiers, sailors, airmen

3543
04:00:33.56 --> 04:00:37.48
and Marines out there, a lot of weight, a lot of burden on these young guys.

3544
04:00:37.48 --> 04:00:41.80
And it's, it's, it's, look, this is, this highlights the story of an officer, but the

3545
04:00:41.80 --> 04:00:48.60
young, the young corpals, the sergeants, it just really is an incredible thing that we

3546
04:00:48.60 --> 04:00:52.52
send these young men and women to do out there on the battlefield.

3547
04:00:52.52 --> 04:00:58.16
I'm glad we were able to capture some of these lessons and share them.

3548
04:00:58.16 --> 04:01:00.16
And um, yeah, so there we go.

3549
04:01:00.16 --> 04:01:06.56
So thanks again to Tom for coming down here and to three five for letting them come down

3550
04:01:06.56 --> 04:01:07.56
for the day.

3551
04:01:07.56 --> 04:01:10.48
Uh, appreciate everyone's support for the podcast.

3552
04:01:10.48 --> 04:01:13.64
Um, if you want to support the podcast and you want to support yourself, you know, get

3553
04:01:13.64 --> 04:01:17.04
yourself some of that jocofuel, get yourself some of that jocofuel.com.

3554
04:01:17.04 --> 04:01:18.76
Have you tried pink mist yet?

3555
04:01:18.76 --> 04:01:19.76
Yes.

3556
04:01:19.76 --> 04:01:20.76
How do you like it?

3557
04:01:20.76 --> 04:01:21.76
I like it.

3558
04:01:21.76 --> 04:01:26.88
It reminds me of, it doesn't remind me, but it's similar to like the orange where it's

3559
04:01:26.88 --> 04:01:31.32
like you, I'm not saying you can't go wrong cause of course you can go wrong, but it's

3560
04:01:31.32 --> 04:01:35.16
one of those ones where it's like, it was good, but I just wasn't surprised that it's

3561
04:01:35.16 --> 04:01:36.16
good.

3562
04:01:36.16 --> 04:01:37.16
You know, it's like that kind.

3563
04:01:37.16 --> 04:01:38.16
Uh, yeah.

3564
04:01:38.16 --> 04:01:40.92
So we're talking about new flavor of discipline go.

3565
04:01:40.92 --> 04:01:41.92
It's called pink mist.

3566
04:01:41.92 --> 04:01:45.20
It's like a pink lemonade scenario.

3567
04:01:45.20 --> 04:01:50.20
It's kind of hard to make the word pink sound cool, but when you put pink mass Friday, it

3568
04:01:50.20 --> 04:01:52.96
might be the only way to make pink sound cool.

3569
04:01:52.96 --> 04:01:54.04
Pink mist.

3570
04:01:54.04 --> 04:01:55.04
So there you go.

3571
04:01:55.04 --> 04:01:57.80
That's our, our energy drink.

3572
04:01:57.80 --> 04:02:00.80
Here's the thing.

3573
04:02:00.80 --> 04:02:02.84
This is not normal energy drink.

3574
04:02:02.84 --> 04:02:04.80
There's no chemicals in there.

3575
04:02:04.80 --> 04:02:06.24
There's no sugar in there.

3576
04:02:06.24 --> 04:02:08.56
It's literally good for you.

3577
04:02:08.56 --> 04:02:11.96
So go get some chocolate discipline go and it'll really help you out in life.

3578
04:02:11.96 --> 04:02:16.92
I think it was you doing a speech to a group of people might have been live.

3579
04:02:16.92 --> 04:02:20.56
I don't know, might have been at origin at the camp.

3580
04:02:20.56 --> 04:02:24.16
Maybe I don't know either way, but here was the point.

3581
04:02:24.16 --> 04:02:28.28
Here was one of the many points where there's like a, there's companies where they'll be

3582
04:02:28.28 --> 04:02:30.32
like, Hey, let's make an energy drink.

3583
04:02:30.32 --> 04:02:32.68
And they'll be like, okay, so what are we going to put in this energy drink?

3584
04:02:32.68 --> 04:02:33.68
Cause we got to sell it.

3585
04:02:33.68 --> 04:02:34.68
Yeah.

3586
04:02:34.68 --> 04:02:38.28
I'll tell you what they're going to put in whatever the consumer will want right now.

3587
04:02:38.28 --> 04:02:39.28
Yeah.

3588
04:02:39.28 --> 04:02:41.24
So it was and what's cheapest.

3589
04:02:41.24 --> 04:02:42.24
Yeah.

3590
04:02:42.24 --> 04:02:46.04
So you, and you made, you said this more eloquently than me, but I'm going to, I'm going to say

3591
04:02:46.04 --> 04:02:47.48
what I really gathered from it.

3592
04:02:47.48 --> 04:02:52.000
And it was kind of like, it kind of haunted me a little bit where you have a company

3593
04:02:52.000 --> 04:02:53.52
that's like, okay, let me make an energy drink.

3594
04:02:53.52 --> 04:02:54.52
What are we going to put in it?

3595
04:02:54.52 --> 04:02:55.52
Okay.

3596
04:02:55.52 --> 04:02:56.92
Let's put some caffeine in it for the energy.

3597
04:02:56.92 --> 04:02:57.92
Right.

3598
04:02:57.92 --> 04:02:58.92
So okay, cool caffeine.

3599
04:02:58.92 --> 04:03:00.40
We'll put this much in however much, right?

3600
04:03:00.40 --> 04:03:03.96
It goes, okay, but we got to preserve it or we got to make it taste good.

3601
04:03:03.96 --> 04:03:06.64
And we got to, you know, cause they, we got to get them to drink it.

3602
04:03:06.64 --> 04:03:07.64
Right.

3603
04:03:07.64 --> 04:03:10.92
Seems, seems, seems like, oh, of course you got to get them to drink it.

3604
04:03:10.92 --> 04:03:11.92
Add sugar.

3605
04:03:11.92 --> 04:03:12.92
But so let's put sugar.

3606
04:03:12.92 --> 04:03:13.92
Okay.

3607
04:03:13.92 --> 04:03:14.92
So sugar.

3608
04:03:14.92 --> 04:03:16.64
We want it to be really good though.

3609
04:03:16.64 --> 04:03:17.64
More sugar.

3610
04:03:17.64 --> 04:03:18.64
More sugar.

3611
04:03:18.64 --> 04:03:19.76
And, you know, okay.

3612
04:03:19.76 --> 04:03:23.04
So I, and even at this point, sugar is like, cool.

3613
04:03:23.04 --> 04:03:25.000
Like that's nothing new, you know?

3614
04:03:25.000 --> 04:03:26.40
Oh, no, no, no.

3615
04:03:26.40 --> 04:03:31.08
Let's put like some other stuff, some chemicals, some preservatives in here, some stuff that,

3616
04:03:31.08 --> 04:03:34.28
and then after a while, these things start to add enough, right?

3617
04:03:34.28 --> 04:03:35.28
All these little ingredients.

3618
04:03:35.28 --> 04:03:38.88
And it's like, okay, has anyone ever thought of like, wow, what this is going to do to like

3619
04:03:38.88 --> 04:03:43.92
a, you know, 17 year old kid or a person or whatever, if they drink one of these every

3620
04:03:43.92 --> 04:03:45.40
day, which is kind of the goal.

3621
04:03:45.40 --> 04:03:48.20
Man, if they, if everyone drank one every day, that'd be freaking awesome.

3622
04:03:48.20 --> 04:03:49.20
Right.

3623
04:03:49.20 --> 04:03:50.20
As far as, okay.

3624
04:03:50.20 --> 04:03:55.12
So has anyone taken, taken account for like, what if these people are drinking one of these,

3625
04:03:55.12 --> 04:03:56.76
two of these every single day?

3626
04:03:56.76 --> 04:03:57.92
Like what's going to happen to them?

3627
04:03:57.92 --> 04:03:59.28
Oh yeah, we did that.

3628
04:03:59.28 --> 04:04:00.84
But like, we don't care about that.

3629
04:04:00.84 --> 04:04:02.36
We just want them to drink them every day.

3630
04:04:02.36 --> 04:04:06.12
Oh, what if, what if like, what if it's really bad for them?

3631
04:04:06.12 --> 04:04:07.92
And what if it causes maybe some death?

3632
04:04:07.92 --> 04:04:09.60
Oh, well, we don't care about that.

3633
04:04:09.60 --> 04:04:12.76
You know, as long as they're drinking them every day, kind of a thing.

3634
04:04:12.76 --> 04:04:16.000
And that's kind of the picture that was kind of painted there where it's like, bro, that's

3635
04:04:16.000 --> 04:04:17.000
true.

3636
04:04:17.000 --> 04:04:18.000
That's true.

3637
04:04:18.000 --> 04:04:19.000
It's 100% true.

3638
04:04:19.000 --> 04:04:23.16
And they can, they cut the corners on the costs.

3639
04:04:23.16 --> 04:04:26.12
Our drinks like three times more to make.

3640
04:04:26.12 --> 04:04:27.12
Well if they cut the corners.

3641
04:04:27.12 --> 04:04:30.32
Some cases four times more than some of the, than what's the, what some of these other

3642
04:04:30.32 --> 04:04:31.52
companies are putting in their drinks.

3643
04:04:31.52 --> 04:04:32.52
Yeah.

3644
04:04:32.52 --> 04:04:34.52
And if they cut costs, that means they pay less for it.

3645
04:04:34.52 --> 04:04:38.96
That means they get more money when you, you know, like, so it makes, it's weird because

3646
04:04:38.96 --> 04:04:42.36
it makes sense on one hand, but on the other hand, it's so like sinister, you know.

3647
04:04:42.36 --> 04:04:44.44
So nothing sinister on our side.

3648
04:04:44.44 --> 04:04:48.08
Only goodness, only the goodness, the goodness of monk fruit.

3649
04:04:48.08 --> 04:04:49.08
Yeah.

3650
04:04:49.08 --> 04:04:50.60
Put some caffeine in there.

3651
04:04:50.60 --> 04:04:51.60
Not too much though.

3652
04:04:51.60 --> 04:04:52.60
Yeah, but just 95 milligrams.

3653
04:04:52.60 --> 04:04:54.56
But we got some new tropics in there.

3654
04:04:54.56 --> 04:04:56.52
Make sure you get all the energy that you're going to need.

3655
04:04:56.52 --> 04:04:57.52
So there you go.

3656
04:04:57.52 --> 04:04:58.52
Get some jocque de ful, get some moque.

3657
04:04:58.52 --> 04:05:01.80
I've been on the moque train lately.

3658
04:05:01.80 --> 04:05:03.52
Peanut butter, be honest with you.

3659
04:05:03.52 --> 04:05:06.84
Ben is going hard in the paint with peanut butter.

3660
04:05:06.84 --> 04:05:08.20
It's so good.

3661
04:05:08.20 --> 04:05:09.20
It's so good.

3662
04:05:09.20 --> 04:05:10.20
It's ridiculous.

3663
04:05:10.20 --> 04:05:11.20
Agreed.

3664
04:05:11.20 --> 04:05:14.80
So jocquefuel.com, you can also go to the vitamin shop.

3665
04:05:14.80 --> 04:05:18.28
Vitamin shop has pink mess, by the way, little exclusive scenario going on with them right

3666
04:05:18.28 --> 04:05:19.28
now.

3667
04:05:19.28 --> 04:05:20.72
And also you can get the stuff at wah-wah.

3668
04:05:20.72 --> 04:05:24.28
Hey, by the way, RTD's ready to drink.

3669
04:05:24.28 --> 04:05:25.28
Moque.

3670
04:05:25.28 --> 04:05:26.28
Moque.

3671
04:05:26.28 --> 04:05:27.28
It's out there.

3672
04:05:27.28 --> 04:05:28.28
It's a protein meal.

3673
04:05:28.28 --> 04:05:30.60
It's a protein dessert.

3674
04:05:30.60 --> 04:05:34.88
It's a protein provider of goodness to you.

3675
04:05:34.88 --> 04:05:36.56
And it's ready to drink.

3676
04:05:36.56 --> 04:05:40.96
It's so funny how like we had like a little stockpile, like a pre-sale stockpile.

3677
04:05:40.96 --> 04:05:44.64
We were like, oh, we'll have enough just for the campers.

3678
04:05:44.64 --> 04:05:45.64
And you know, just not enough.

3679
04:05:45.64 --> 04:05:50.56
No, what we thought was we will reserve multiple pallets.

3680
04:05:50.56 --> 04:05:54.84
It'll be more than enough to last one week.

3681
04:05:54.84 --> 04:05:56.68
Dude, people went ham.

3682
04:05:56.68 --> 04:05:59.80
Because once you taste one, you're like, I'm going to have one for breakfast, one for lunch,

3683
04:05:59.80 --> 04:06:00.80
one for dinner.

3684
04:06:00.80 --> 04:06:01.80
I'll put them in my cereal.

3685
04:06:01.80 --> 04:06:02.80
Put them in my cereal.

3686
04:06:02.80 --> 04:06:03.80
It's all good.

3687
04:06:03.80 --> 04:06:04.80
We're freaking drinking this stuff 24 hours.

3688
04:06:04.80 --> 04:06:05.80
And it lasts like two days.

3689
04:06:05.80 --> 04:06:06.80
It lasts like two days.

3690
04:06:06.80 --> 04:06:07.80
Yeah.

3691
04:06:07.80 --> 04:06:08.80
Like two days, and that was it.

3692
04:06:08.80 --> 04:06:09.80
Yeah.

3693
04:06:09.80 --> 04:06:15.36
So we are on the path of just trying to produce as much of the ready to drink moque as we

3694
04:06:15.36 --> 04:06:20.20
possibly can right now to get it out there because it's delicious and it's freaking good

3695
04:06:20.20 --> 04:06:21.28
for you.

3696
04:06:21.28 --> 04:06:22.28
Yeah.

3697
04:06:22.28 --> 04:06:23.28
So good.

3698
04:06:23.28 --> 04:06:24.28
So good.

3699
04:06:24.28 --> 04:06:25.28
Drink as many as you want.

3700
04:06:25.28 --> 04:06:26.28
Yeah.

3701
04:06:26.28 --> 04:06:27.28
That's alljagofuel.com.

3702
04:06:27.28 --> 04:06:30.40
Speaking of Jiu-Jitsu, originusa.com.

3703
04:06:30.40 --> 04:06:32.64
We're making Jiu-Jitsu Gis.

3704
04:06:32.64 --> 04:06:34.72
We're making jeans.

3705
04:06:34.72 --> 04:06:35.84
We're making boots.

3706
04:06:35.84 --> 04:06:37.60
We're making Hunt gear.

3707
04:06:37.60 --> 04:06:41.64
Hey, the Delta 68 has new colors or something like this.

3708
04:06:41.64 --> 04:06:42.64
Yeah.

3709
04:06:42.64 --> 04:06:44.12
I saw like a picture, little thing.

3710
04:06:44.12 --> 04:06:45.12
Yeah.

3711
04:06:45.12 --> 04:06:46.12
Yeah.

3712
04:06:46.12 --> 04:06:47.12
Oh, interesting.

3713
04:06:47.12 --> 04:06:54.76
One of the wash houses, which is like a giant machine, a series of machines that can

3714
04:06:54.76 --> 04:06:59.72
wash things at a high rate so they get like worn.

3715
04:06:59.72 --> 04:07:00.96
They get broken in.

3716
04:07:00.96 --> 04:07:01.96
Yeah.

3717
04:07:01.96 --> 04:07:03.52
Is that the traditional way?

3718
04:07:03.52 --> 04:07:06.96
Because you know how you have a lighter color jean, then you have the freaking dark, dark

3719
04:07:06.96 --> 04:07:07.96
color.

3720
04:07:07.96 --> 04:07:08.96
It's called a wash house.

3721
04:07:08.96 --> 04:07:09.96
Yeah.

3722
04:07:09.96 --> 04:07:14.20
Now wash houses are really hard to build and we have one.

3723
04:07:14.20 --> 04:07:18.32
But ours wasn't working, but you know, the team down there in North Carolina has been

3724
04:07:18.32 --> 04:07:21.48
busting their ass, getting the wash house back up and running.

3725
04:07:21.48 --> 04:07:26.80
We had to get new machines, had to get them installed, put in there.

3726
04:07:26.80 --> 04:07:32.32
And now we have like the original wash house from the golden era of American textile is

3727
04:07:32.32 --> 04:07:33.32
back up and running.

3728
04:07:33.32 --> 04:07:34.32
Are you going to do that?

3729
04:07:34.32 --> 04:07:35.32
You think we're playing, bro?

3730
04:07:35.32 --> 04:07:36.32
We're not playing.

3731
04:07:36.32 --> 04:07:37.32
I don't think we're playing.

3732
04:07:37.32 --> 04:07:38.32
I know you're not.

3733
04:07:38.32 --> 04:07:39.72
Are you going to do acid wash?

3734
04:07:39.72 --> 04:07:40.72
Remember acid wash?

3735
04:07:40.72 --> 04:07:42.12
I don't think so.

3736
04:07:42.12 --> 04:07:43.12
I feel like acid wash.

3737
04:07:43.12 --> 04:07:44.72
That's 80s.

3738
04:07:44.72 --> 04:07:46.88
That right there is up there with like hair metal to me.

3739
04:07:46.88 --> 04:07:47.88
I don't like it.

3740
04:07:47.88 --> 04:07:48.88
Right?

3741
04:07:48.88 --> 04:07:49.88
Yeah.

3742
04:07:49.88 --> 04:07:51.72
It's weird how acid wash at the time was freaking awesome, by the way.

3743
04:07:51.72 --> 04:07:52.72
Not me.

3744
04:07:52.72 --> 04:07:53.72
I never liked it.

3745
04:07:53.72 --> 04:07:54.72
It was awesome in the time.

3746
04:07:54.72 --> 04:08:01.64
I'm happy I don't have any pictures of me wearing acid wash jeans or affliction t-shirts.

3747
04:08:01.64 --> 04:08:02.64
Interesting.

3748
04:08:02.64 --> 04:08:05.84
Remember when affliction was all wild and all the companies had all the weird designs?

3749
04:08:05.84 --> 04:08:10.52
I have a few pictures of us and you have, it's not affliction, but it's like in that

3750
04:08:10.52 --> 04:08:12.60
direction, but it was like throw down.

3751
04:08:12.60 --> 04:08:14.84
Because a lot of people were following suit.

3752
04:08:14.84 --> 04:08:16.76
They had one that was a little bit.

3753
04:08:16.76 --> 04:08:19.96
And also, you know what my caveat here is?

3754
04:08:19.96 --> 04:08:25.36
I did wear some walkout shirts for a specific fight or for a specific camp, for a specific

3755
04:08:25.36 --> 04:08:32.04
fight, which I can't remember may or may not have been straight up just like cheesy affliction.

3756
04:08:32.04 --> 04:08:35.68
But luckily for me, I didn't own one.

3757
04:08:35.68 --> 04:08:38.28
They don't have pictures of me at the club.

3758
04:08:38.28 --> 04:08:40.80
Remember the affliction jeans, too?

3759
04:08:40.80 --> 04:08:42.48
They had like the weird...

3760
04:08:42.48 --> 04:08:43.48
They go hard, man.

3761
04:08:43.48 --> 04:08:45.60
They go hard, those affliction.

3762
04:08:45.60 --> 04:08:46.60
You take something.

3763
04:08:46.60 --> 04:08:48.68
I think the jeans were acid wash.

3764
04:08:48.68 --> 04:08:49.68
Yeah, they were.

3765
04:08:49.68 --> 04:08:51.48
But you know the book, The Diacotomy of Leadership?

3766
04:08:51.48 --> 04:08:52.48
Yeah, I know that one.

3767
04:08:52.48 --> 04:08:55.04
If you take anything and you make it an extreme, it can become bad.

3768
04:08:55.04 --> 04:08:59.08
So if you take like jeans and there's like thread on them, but then you start going crazy

3769
04:08:59.08 --> 04:09:01.08
with it, it turns bad.

3770
04:09:01.08 --> 04:09:04.96
If you put a pair of jeans in a wash house and they become like comfortable and a little

3771
04:09:04.96 --> 04:09:07.16
bit faded, that's cool.

3772
04:09:07.16 --> 04:09:09.80
But then you put like acid on them and they look all weird.

3773
04:09:09.80 --> 04:09:10.80
That's not cool.

3774
04:09:10.80 --> 04:09:11.80
You can't take stuff to an extreme.

3775
04:09:11.80 --> 04:09:13.28
I understand.

3776
04:09:13.28 --> 04:09:16.80
And that's why they kind of stuck in the 80s where you went hard and it was like, freak

3777
04:09:16.80 --> 04:09:17.80
out, they jumped on that trend hard.

3778
04:09:17.80 --> 04:09:19.24
You know the 80s is coming back, right?

3779
04:09:19.24 --> 04:09:20.24
Apparently.

3780
04:09:20.24 --> 04:09:23.56
Yeah, because there's a show called Stranger Things, which I have not watched, but my

3781
04:09:23.56 --> 04:09:26.92
daughter's watch or yeah, one of my daughters is into it.

3782
04:09:26.92 --> 04:09:27.92
But and do you think...

3783
04:09:27.92 --> 04:09:28.92
It's the 80s, bro.

3784
04:09:28.92 --> 04:09:34.16
Okay, and even me just starting to say, ask this question, I feel like you're probably

3785
04:09:34.16 --> 04:09:37.000
one of the last people to ask about this or maybe one of the first.

3786
04:09:37.000 --> 04:09:38.000
I don't know.

3787
04:09:38.000 --> 04:09:40.52
But do you think that like, you know, things always come back, right?

3788
04:09:40.52 --> 04:09:44.96
The retro and it comes back and you know, all this and fashion is one of those ones.

3789
04:09:44.96 --> 04:09:49.76
But isn't there always like one, two, three things that are like, that's too hardcore

3790
04:09:49.76 --> 04:09:51.48
80s that that'll never come back.

3791
04:09:51.48 --> 04:09:52.48
Yeah, that's true.

3792
04:09:52.48 --> 04:09:53.68
But here's an interesting thing.

3793
04:09:53.68 --> 04:09:58.88
First of all, the 80s in my mind, it seems like it was a few years ago, but it's like

3794
04:09:58.88 --> 04:10:01.56
35 years ago.

3795
04:10:01.56 --> 04:10:04.44
So when I was a kid, 60s stuff, right?

3796
04:10:04.44 --> 04:10:07.92
60s and 70s, like things were like hype.

3797
04:10:07.92 --> 04:10:10.72
But that was only, I mean, this is in the 80s for me.

3798
04:10:10.72 --> 04:10:13.94
So they only like 15 years old and they were still hype.

3799
04:10:13.94 --> 04:10:15.56
You know what I'm saying?

3800
04:10:15.56 --> 04:10:19.92
So it's weird that we're talking about things that are coming back, but it's been 40 years

3801
04:10:19.92 --> 04:10:22.92
since the 80s.

3802
04:10:22.92 --> 04:10:25.20
Just straight Miami Vice activity going down.

3803
04:10:25.20 --> 04:10:26.20
Yeah.

3804
04:10:26.20 --> 04:10:27.20
Did you like Miami Vice?

3805
04:10:27.20 --> 04:10:29.12
Yeah, here and there.

3806
04:10:29.12 --> 04:10:31.44
But I guess that was kind of a big thing.

3807
04:10:31.44 --> 04:10:36.04
I used to work with at the valet used to say like, oh, you're Tubbs from Miami Vice.

3808
04:10:36.04 --> 04:10:41.68
Oh, somebody did a Photoshop of you and me and it's clubs and clubs and crock and it

3809
04:10:41.68 --> 04:10:42.68
looked legit.

3810
04:10:42.68 --> 04:10:43.68
Yeah.

3811
04:10:43.68 --> 04:10:44.68
They did a good job.

3812
04:10:44.68 --> 04:10:47.08
They did a good job of that.

3813
04:10:47.08 --> 04:10:48.08
That made me laugh.

3814
04:10:48.08 --> 04:10:52.36
And you kind of, I will say you kind of get a little bit of Tubbs going on.

3815
04:10:52.36 --> 04:10:53.36
That's what they said.

3816
04:10:53.36 --> 04:10:57.60
I didn't gather that at the time, but hey, cool, man.

3817
04:10:57.60 --> 04:11:00.80
If more than one percent, I, you know, lend it some weight.

3818
04:11:00.80 --> 04:11:01.80
All right.

3819
04:11:01.80 --> 04:11:02.80
So there you go.

3820
04:11:02.80 --> 04:11:03.80
So no acid wash.

3821
04:11:03.80 --> 04:11:04.80
No acid wash.

3822
04:11:04.80 --> 04:11:06.08
We'll prevent that from happening.

3823
04:11:06.08 --> 04:11:07.08
Right on.

3824
04:11:07.08 --> 04:11:08.72
Also, jockel store, jockel store.

3825
04:11:08.72 --> 04:11:09.72
Discipline equals freedom.

3826
04:11:09.72 --> 04:11:15.52
If you want to represent with a shirt, a hoodie, what winter, what fall, right?

3827
04:11:15.52 --> 04:11:16.52
Is it fall right now?

3828
04:11:16.52 --> 04:11:17.52
We're getting there.

3829
04:11:17.52 --> 04:11:19.60
And winter, you know, we've got some hoodies on there.

3830
04:11:19.60 --> 04:11:21.88
Discipline equals freedom.

3831
04:11:21.88 --> 04:11:23.76
Standard issue shirt is on.

3832
04:11:23.76 --> 04:11:24.76
It's rolling.

3833
04:11:24.76 --> 04:11:28.88
Oh, the standard issue speaking of which layers, layers, but people are representing

3834
04:11:28.88 --> 04:11:30.56
currently as we speak.

3835
04:11:30.56 --> 04:11:31.56
So yeah, look out for that.

3836
04:11:31.56 --> 04:11:34.28
Also we got the short locker, which is the subscription.

3837
04:11:34.28 --> 04:11:36.08
People are representing that hardcore.

3838
04:11:36.08 --> 04:11:37.60
I'll just see random people.

3839
04:11:37.60 --> 04:11:38.60
Oh, that's our show.

3840
04:11:38.60 --> 04:11:39.60
That's the locker.

3841
04:11:39.60 --> 04:11:40.60
In the game for all on supporting.

3842
04:11:40.60 --> 04:11:41.60
Yep.

3843
04:11:41.60 --> 04:11:43.28
We get a new design every month.

3844
04:11:43.28 --> 04:11:44.28
They're new.

3845
04:11:44.28 --> 04:11:45.28
They're creative.

3846
04:11:45.28 --> 04:11:46.28
See if you can recognize them.

3847
04:11:46.28 --> 04:11:47.28
Yeah.

3848
04:11:47.28 --> 04:11:48.28
Supporting.

3849
04:11:48.28 --> 04:11:49.88
Appreciate the support and subscribe to the podcast.

3850
04:11:49.88 --> 04:11:51.24
Also, also, we have Jaco on the ground.

3851
04:11:51.24 --> 04:11:54.04
We just recorded a couple of those what yesterday.

3852
04:11:54.04 --> 04:11:57.76
So that's where we answer your questions directly.

3853
04:11:57.76 --> 04:12:02.36
We also cover some, some subjects that I have been coming up with.

3854
04:12:02.36 --> 04:12:06.32
I, you always give me some subjects.

3855
04:12:06.32 --> 04:12:13.08
I feel a little bit bad because so far I think we've done one of your subjects out of 50.

3856
04:12:13.08 --> 04:12:19.64
So I got to open my mind a little bit more, you know, except what you're putting down.

3857
04:12:19.64 --> 04:12:21.88
Maybe also I'm not seeing the vision.

3858
04:12:21.88 --> 04:12:25.76
Like you're putting some, you know, we should talk about this thing.

3859
04:12:25.76 --> 04:12:27.48
And I'm not really, I'm like thinking, what the fuck?

3860
04:12:27.48 --> 04:12:28.48
What is this going to get us?

3861
04:12:28.48 --> 04:12:29.48
I mean, yeah.

3862
04:12:29.48 --> 04:12:32.32
And I have to figure that out about you.

3863
04:12:32.32 --> 04:12:36.16
Like what is it exactly that goes through your mind that says, okay, I could talk about

3864
04:12:36.16 --> 04:12:39.28
this versus I won't.

3865
04:12:39.28 --> 04:12:42.40
Because here's, here's all think of something or I'll come across them or something will

3866
04:12:42.40 --> 04:12:43.88
be presented to me.

3867
04:12:43.88 --> 04:12:46.12
And then I'll be like, hey, that's interesting.

3868
04:12:46.12 --> 04:12:48.28
I wonder what Jaco would think about this.

3869
04:12:48.28 --> 04:12:50.20
So then I'm like, oh, I'll like write it down or whatever.

3870
04:12:50.20 --> 04:12:52.20
I've never gotten that vibe from your suggestions.

3871
04:12:52.20 --> 04:12:56.12
For I've only gotten like, what is this?

3872
04:12:56.12 --> 04:12:57.60
Interesting.

3873
04:12:57.60 --> 04:12:59.92
I've only gotten like, why is this interesting?

3874
04:12:59.92 --> 04:13:00.92
Yeah.

3875
04:13:00.92 --> 04:13:03.36
You'll be like, talk about something.

3876
04:13:03.36 --> 04:13:06.20
And I'm like, I don't understand how that's good.

3877
04:13:06.20 --> 04:13:07.36
So we'll do one of my subjects.

3878
04:13:07.36 --> 04:13:08.36
Okay.

3879
04:13:08.36 --> 04:13:10.000
So this is what I'm going to do.

3880
04:13:10.000 --> 04:13:13.08
Are you disappointed when you get the notes and you're like, oh, he didn't pick my subject

3881
04:13:13.08 --> 04:13:14.08
again.

3882
04:13:14.08 --> 04:13:15.60
You feel like you're spinning your wheels and wasting your time?

3883
04:13:15.60 --> 04:13:16.60
No, I never do.

3884
04:13:16.60 --> 04:13:17.60
I never do.

3885
04:13:17.60 --> 04:13:21.96
But disappointed sometime, you know, maybe here and there because sometimes, especially

3886
04:13:21.96 --> 04:13:25.80
the list that I just sent you, some of those were just like a thought that popped in my,

3887
04:13:25.80 --> 04:13:26.80
and I just wrote it down.

3888
04:13:26.80 --> 04:13:29.32
So, and I just, which one is the best one?

3889
04:13:29.32 --> 04:13:30.32
Best one.

3890
04:13:30.32 --> 04:13:31.32
The best idea that you have had.

3891
04:13:31.32 --> 04:13:32.32
Oh, I don't know.

3892
04:13:32.32 --> 04:13:33.32
I'd have to look at it.

3893
04:13:33.32 --> 04:13:36.000
But they can't be that good of ideas if you don't even remember them.

3894
04:13:36.000 --> 04:13:37.56
I think they're all pretty good.

3895
04:13:37.56 --> 04:13:39.16
I thought they're all pretty good.

3896
04:13:39.16 --> 04:13:40.16
Oh, here's one.

3897
04:13:40.16 --> 04:13:46.56
I don't know if it's the best one, but like the difference between like pain and suffering.

3898
04:13:46.56 --> 04:13:48.56
So it's more like the, it's like the concept.

3899
04:13:48.56 --> 04:13:52.04
I mean, and maybe I won't put into words as good, but the idea that like, you know how

3900
04:13:52.04 --> 04:13:54.84
when you feel pain, the natural instinct is to be like, oh, it's pain.

3901
04:13:54.84 --> 04:13:55.84
So avoid it.

3902
04:13:55.84 --> 04:13:59.08
But then every once in a while, you have a certain type of pain that you know is not

3903
04:13:59.08 --> 04:14:00.08
like damage.

3904
04:14:00.08 --> 04:14:01.08
It's not damage.

3905
04:14:01.08 --> 04:14:04.92
You know, it's like, whether it be for a good cause or it's more for like constructions,

3906
04:14:04.92 --> 04:14:08.32
just like, like if you, you know, when you lift weights now.

3907
04:14:08.32 --> 04:14:10.48
So when I was a little kid, I used to like do pushups or whatever.

3908
04:14:10.48 --> 04:14:13.80
And then the next day, my arms and chest would be sore and I used to hate it because I didn't

3909
04:14:13.80 --> 04:14:14.80
know what it was.

3910
04:14:14.80 --> 04:14:15.80
I mean, oh, I don't want that feeling.

3911
04:14:15.80 --> 04:14:16.80
I don't.

3912
04:14:16.80 --> 04:14:21.20
But then when you realize what part of the process it is, you kind of like now as an

3913
04:14:21.20 --> 04:14:26.72
adult and we talked about this before offline or whatever where when you have doms, you

3914
04:14:26.72 --> 04:14:30.92
kind of have like, whether it be from Jiu-Jitsu or lifting, you kind of have a better feeling

3915
04:14:30.92 --> 04:14:32.48
because you know you're sort of in the game.

3916
04:14:32.48 --> 04:14:35.000
So it's like, you won't avoid that anymore.

3917
04:14:35.000 --> 04:14:37.12
In fact, it's kind of like, so what's the difference?

3918
04:14:37.12 --> 04:14:39.60
Like, where's the difference, you know?

3919
04:14:39.60 --> 04:14:42.04
And can you just flip it over mentally?

3920
04:14:42.04 --> 04:14:43.56
See what I'm saying?

3921
04:14:43.56 --> 04:14:45.44
Cause certain pain, you can be like, oh, this sucks.

3922
04:14:45.44 --> 04:14:46.44
Wait a second.

3923
04:14:46.44 --> 04:14:47.44
Wait a second.

3924
04:14:47.44 --> 04:14:48.44
You know what I'm saying?

3925
04:14:48.44 --> 04:14:52.52
I'm starting to recognize why these subjects are again Jiu-Jitsu.

3926
04:14:52.52 --> 04:14:54.40
So I pick the subjects most of the time.

3927
04:14:54.40 --> 04:14:55.80
We're waiting on some good ones.

3928
04:14:55.80 --> 04:14:58.24
Echo Charles, I may open mine, you know?

3929
04:14:58.24 --> 04:15:03.16
I'm going to put out a list of subjects that I thought of and I'm going to see if people

3930
04:15:03.16 --> 04:15:04.20
want to vote on them.

3931
04:15:04.20 --> 04:15:07.000
And then I'm going to open the bottom of the list for suggestions.

3932
04:15:07.000 --> 04:15:08.000
Do that.

3933
04:15:08.000 --> 04:15:09.000
That's good.

3934
04:15:09.000 --> 04:15:10.000
I like it.

3935
04:15:10.000 --> 04:15:11.000
Yeah, that's kind of a good idea.

3936
04:15:11.000 --> 04:15:12.36
Yeah, so you can, that's jocke1derground.com.

3937
04:15:12.36 --> 04:15:13.84
It costs $8.18 a month.

3938
04:15:13.84 --> 04:15:15.40
If you can't afford it, just email assistance.

3939
04:15:15.40 --> 04:15:19.28
Instead of underground at jocke1derground.com because we got to have a place that we control

3940
04:15:19.28 --> 04:15:21.12
because right now we don't control the platforms.

3941
04:15:21.12 --> 04:15:22.12
We're good with the platforms.

3942
04:15:22.12 --> 04:15:23.12
We get along.

3943
04:15:23.12 --> 04:15:24.12
It's fine.

3944
04:15:24.12 --> 04:15:25.56
But you never know when things might go sideways.

3945
04:15:25.56 --> 04:15:27.56
So we have a YouTube channel as well.

3946
04:15:27.56 --> 04:15:28.56
We got psychological warfare.

3947
04:15:28.56 --> 04:15:30.64
We got flip side canvas, bunch of books.

3948
04:15:30.64 --> 04:15:32.40
Hey, check out the books.

3949
04:15:32.40 --> 04:15:38.12
Check out the book, Always Faithful by Tom Schumann and Zanula Zaki.

3950
04:15:38.12 --> 04:15:39.12
Available.

3951
04:15:39.12 --> 04:15:43.24
We'll have it linked in the thing.

3952
04:15:43.24 --> 04:15:45.28
Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.

3953
04:15:45.28 --> 04:15:46.28
Check that book out.

3954
04:15:46.28 --> 04:15:48.72
You want to hear about the war in Iraq up close and personal.

3955
04:15:48.72 --> 04:15:50.40
That's a great way to do it.

3956
04:15:50.40 --> 04:15:52.80
And then I've written a bunch of books, of course.

3957
04:15:52.80 --> 04:15:56.20
Also have Escalon Front Leadership Consultancy where we solve problems through leadership.

3958
04:15:56.20 --> 04:15:58.04
So many problems.

3959
04:15:58.04 --> 04:15:59.04
Let me rephrase that.

3960
04:15:59.04 --> 04:16:02.28
All your problems in your organization are leadership problems.

3961
04:16:02.28 --> 04:16:03.28
That's what they are.

3962
04:16:03.28 --> 04:16:09.68
So if you're having issues inside your organization, it's because you have issues with your leadership.

3963
04:16:09.68 --> 04:16:10.68
You want to fix them?

3964
04:16:10.68 --> 04:16:12.96
Go to escalonfront.com.

3965
04:16:12.96 --> 04:16:16.48
And check out what we offer, all kinds of different things from leadership consulting

3966
04:16:16.48 --> 04:16:19.72
to events that we put on all through that.

3967
04:16:19.72 --> 04:16:29.52
We also have an online training platform because just like trying to get in shape, you can't

3968
04:16:29.52 --> 04:16:31.96
just go one time to the gym and think you're going to get in shape.

3969
04:16:31.96 --> 04:16:32.96
You got to train every day.

3970
04:16:32.96 --> 04:16:38.88
So extremownership.com, if you want to come and check out our online academy.

3971
04:16:38.88 --> 04:16:45.64
If you want to support Patrol Base Abate, go to pbabate.org.

3972
04:16:45.64 --> 04:16:51.08
So support what Tom's got going on there for veterans.

3973
04:16:51.08 --> 04:16:54.44
And if you want to help service members act and retire their families, Gold Star family,

3974
04:16:54.44 --> 04:16:56.32
check out Mark Lee's mom, Mama Lee.

3975
04:16:56.32 --> 04:16:59.12
She's got an incredible charity organization.

3976
04:16:59.12 --> 04:17:03.80
If you want to donate or you want to get involved, go to americasmightywarriors.org.

3977
04:17:03.80 --> 04:17:05.96
And heroes and horses.

3978
04:17:05.96 --> 04:17:06.96
Micah Fank up there.

3979
04:17:06.96 --> 04:17:08.16
He's in the wilderness right now.

3980
04:17:08.16 --> 04:17:15.76
I'm on a horse with 40 other guys and they are finding themselves in the wilderness.

3981
04:17:15.76 --> 04:17:26.96
If you want to check us out on social media, Tom Schumann is at Killzone Z zero N three.

3982
04:17:26.96 --> 04:17:29.96
And for us on the Twitter, on the gram on Facebook, Echoes at Echo Draws.

3983
04:17:29.96 --> 04:17:31.96
I am a chocolate willing.

3984
04:17:31.96 --> 04:17:35.28
Watch out for the algorithm that's trying to get you.

3985
04:17:35.28 --> 04:17:41.56
And thanks once again to Major Tom Schumann for his service in the Marine Corps, his continued

3986
04:17:41.56 --> 04:17:42.56
service in the Marine Corps.

3987
04:17:42.56 --> 04:17:44.56
Thanks for sharing some of those lessons here.

3988
04:17:44.56 --> 04:17:45.56
Appreciate you coming down.

3989
04:17:45.56 --> 04:17:49.36
Thanks to three five for cutting them loose for the day to come down here and share some

3990
04:17:49.36 --> 04:17:56.04
of those lessons and to the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that have given their lives

3991
04:17:56.04 --> 04:18:00.04
so that we can live in freedom.

3992
04:18:00.04 --> 04:18:03.12
We are forever indebted to you.

3993
04:18:03.12 --> 04:18:07.96
And we will not squander this gift.

3994
04:18:07.96 --> 04:18:13.76
And also to our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

3995
04:18:13.76 --> 04:18:19.000
correction officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

3996
04:18:19.000 --> 04:18:24.92
Thank you for your sacrifice to keep us safe here at home.

3997
04:18:24.92 --> 04:18:27.96
And everyone else out there.

3998
04:18:27.96 --> 04:18:35.16
Just one more thing in the book and Tom mentioned it briefly today.

3999
04:18:35.16 --> 04:18:43.64
It's something that Sergeant Matt Abbate scrawled on the wall of his patrol base in Afghanistan.

4000
04:18:43.64 --> 04:18:53.08
It said simply, someone must walk the point.

4001
04:18:53.08 --> 04:18:54.68
That means someone has to be out in front.

4002
04:18:54.68 --> 04:18:56.20
Someone has to take risks.

4003
04:18:56.20 --> 04:18:58.48
Someone has to make things happen.

4004
04:18:58.48 --> 04:19:00.40
Someone has to look out for threats.

4005
04:19:00.40 --> 04:19:05.20
Someone has to guide the way.

4006
04:19:05.20 --> 04:19:07.88
Someone has to move forward.

4007
04:19:07.88 --> 04:19:14.16
And it seems like Sergeant Abbate was talking to all of us.

4008
04:19:14.16 --> 04:19:16.48
And he wasn't just talking about war.

4009
04:19:16.48 --> 04:19:18.44
He was talking about life.

4010
04:19:18.44 --> 04:19:24.12
So go out there and take point.

4011
04:19:24.12 --> 04:19:27.72
And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
