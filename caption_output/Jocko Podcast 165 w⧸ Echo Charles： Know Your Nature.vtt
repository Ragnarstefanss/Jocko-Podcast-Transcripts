00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 165 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.50
Good evening, I've said that war is the ultimate teacher.

3
00:00:19.50 --> 00:00:27.000
And I think it's also true to say that war is the ultimate revealer.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It reveals a side of people that would not normally be allowed to come out.

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Because in war there's so much happening, there's so much pressure, there's so much emotion.

6
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So intense and I saw people change and I don't want to make this overly dramatic.

7
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And in most cases I'm not talking about some big dramatic transformation that a person goes through.

8
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But I am talking about changes and the changes were often visible.

9
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Visible things that would be out of character for someone.

10
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They start acting a different way.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Sometimes negative and sometimes positive.

12
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There might be someone who's temper gets quick.

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It starts to flare up.

14
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
There might be someone that becomes more understanding, more forgiving.

15
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Some people were happier in combat.

16
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And some were just absolutely stressed to the core.

17
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And when I look back now, it becomes very clear that there were some,

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'll call it oscillations in my own attitude.

19
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There were sometimes when I had to real myself in.

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I definitely try and stay professional at all times.

21
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That's kind of what I do.

22
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I try to play the game.

23
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I try not to get emotional.

24
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's just how I try and roll.

25
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But I could feel it sometimes.

26
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Starting to come apart a little bit.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I would have to breathe mentally, mentally, breathe, consciously.

28
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Pull the pieces back together.

29
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So I don't lose my temper.

30
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I don't lose my composure.

31
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I know that that's a good quality.

32
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's one that I saw other leaders in act.

33
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I thought that that was a positive quality.

34
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And it's one that I tried to emulate.

35
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I got pretty good at emulating that quality.

36
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But sometimes on deployment, I really had to focus on that.

37
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I had to focus on keeping my composure.

38
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I had to focus on not getting emotional.

39
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I had to detach and tell myself to settle down and keep it together.

40
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And it's not easy to do.

41
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And some people have a hard time doing that.

42
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And they get sure fused and they lose their temper.

43
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The drop of a hat once they're under the stress of sustained combat.

44
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Others will not do that.

45
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Others will go numb.

46
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And they'll just kind of turn off.

47
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I tried to stay balanced.

48
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Not to completely turn off my emotions, but at the same time not get emotional.

49
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But I had to think about that.

50
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And it consciously think about that.

51
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And there were other things that I noticed about myself,

52
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
especially when I look back.

53
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
One thing I noticed is that the little things they they really didn't.

54
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Really didn't matter.

55
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Anymore.

56
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They lost things of little importance.

57
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Pretty much lost all importance.

58
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
If no one was dead and no one was wounded, then things were going to be okay.

59
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's how it was for me.

60
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And some people go in the opposite direction.

61
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
They start to lose their mind over little, meaningless things.

62
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And what they're doing when they lash out in those situations is that's how they're letting out the.

63
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Seaving all encompassing stress that they're feeling.

64
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Another thing I noticed is that I'm normally.

65
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Very tactful when I communicate with people up and down the chain of command.

66
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it's pretty natural for me.

67
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I've been doing it for so long.

68
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm thinking about what I'm saying.

69
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I'm making sure I'm saying the right things and they're being understood correctly.

70
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I understand the importance of communicating from a leadership perspective.

71
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But during combat deployments, I can tell you I had to think a little bit more.

72
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I had to put a little bit more thought into what I was saying because the urge I was fighting against.

73
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Often was this urge just to be.

74
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Offensively blunt.

75
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Just blunt.

76
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And really even condescending or sarcastic or patronizing or snide or mocking or cutting.

77
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Because there is some level of madness in war.

78
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There just is.

79
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I mean, let's face it.

80
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You're going to go out and you're trying to kill people and they're trying to kill you.

81
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And your friends are trying to kill their friends and their friends are trying to kill your friends.

82
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That's not normal.

83
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That's if you take that out of context, that's just madness.

84
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And that madness in war, it can creep into your head and then very easily it can creep out of your mouth if you let it.

85
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And these were all these types of things that they happen to me.

86
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They happen to everyone.

87
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I think I had a pretty good handle on it.

88
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And some people handle it better.

89
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Some people handle it worse.

90
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The combat situations I was in.

91
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
There's people that have gone through infinitely harder combat scenarios for all of mankind from the history of mankind.

92
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Everyone in these situations is going to have to react to them in some way.

93
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Everyone's going to be impacted by that madness of war.

94
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And like I said, they're going to react in different ways depending on who they are depending on their background, depending on their personality.

95
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But the war itself is going to reveal.

96
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's going to reveal strengths and weaknesses. It's going to reveal fears and regrets.

97
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's going to reveal ego and selflessness.

98
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And when we see death, when we face death and when our friends and our comrades are wounded and mailed and killed,

99
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that has an effect.

100
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And you might think, how hard do I have to pull in on the reins of my own fury and hatred and murderous thoughts?

101
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
When young man after young man is sent home in a flag draped coffin,

102
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I can tell you I had to pull in those reins hard.

103
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And I wasn't alone.

104
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I was surrounded by men with the same vengeful thoughts.

105
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
But those thoughts have to be tempered and they have to be controlled or else everything falls apart.

106
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But those thoughts get revealed because of war.

107
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And war reveals things about us that otherwise might slip by.

108
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Things we might not want to share.

109
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Thoughts that we might not even know are a part of us.

110
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But they are a part of us.

111
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And in the end war ultimately reveals who we are.

112
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
It reveals our nature.

113
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And thereby reveals human nature itself.

114
00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And we can imagine that understanding all these different actions and reactions from your subordinate leaders from your commanders,

115
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
from your troops, from yourself.

116
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:16.000
There is no way to effectively lead without some understanding of all these people and their nature.

117
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:29.000
People that you must work with in order to accomplish the mission in order to win.

118
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
While that is crystal clear in war, it applies to every undertaking.

119
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It applies to everything that you try and do.

120
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Knowing the people you work with, understanding the people you work with, knowing and understanding your enemy,

121
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
knowing and understanding yourself.

122
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Knowing and understanding psychology and human nature and the better you can do that.

123
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
The better you will perform as a team and as an individual.

124
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Then especially as a leader.

125
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And we spent the last podcast talking about the first part of a book called Psychology for the Fighting Man.

126
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
What you should know about yourself and others.

127
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It's a very straightforward book written in 1942, right as World War II was kicking off.

128
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And on the last podcast we covered the early sections in the book about things like putting the right people in the right jobs,

129
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
about the importance of training, about the best ways to teach and learn and how to become more efficient.

130
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And today we're going to dive into the second half of the same book, which gets into some incredibly insightful and some incredibly revealing topics.

131
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So let's go back to the book.

132
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Kicking off with this section.

133
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's actually not the second half of the book.

134
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
This is probably the last third of the book that we're getting into.

135
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And let's start off with this section.

136
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
That's about morale.

137
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Here we go.

138
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
It all depends on the incentives to human action on men's motives on their emotions and how they react to their emotions.

139
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It can be developed in a military unit by the control of those psychological conditions, which determine men's desires and conduct and affect their attitudes toward one another and toward the great undertaking of winning a war.

140
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And we're going to talk about incentives. Some of these are pretty obvious starting off with hunger.

141
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Hunger is a mess called most sure to be heard.

142
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Pain is an alert seldom missed.

143
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The most primitive incentives for action, which man shares with other animals, are his bodily needs.

144
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Hunger thirst sex.

145
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The need for rest when he is tired, the need for activity when rested, the desire to escape from pain, extreme heat, extreme cold, and other intolerable conditions.

146
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
It might be possible to control men or animals by the use of these incentives.

147
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You might make a man go hungry until his work is done.

148
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And then let him eat as a reward.

149
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You might make a man fight by lashing him and then letting up on him as a reward for fighting.

150
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But that isn't the way the R Army works.

151
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Whenever possible it supplies enough food and rest to its soldiers and makes other provisions for their comfort so that they stay in good spirits and can do their work well.

152
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
But in areas, but in fighting areas it's not always possible to provide these physical comforts.

153
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
When food or water is short, when the weather is too hot or too cold, when it becomes impossible to bathe and shave, when bombs and shells drive sleep away.

154
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And fatigue makes a man that makes effort a torture, problems combat morale arise.

155
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And then some other incentive is required beyond their animal need to keep men going to make them determined to keep fighting unto death.

156
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:51.000
When the primitive needs are no longer enough, it is the social incentives which help a fighting man do his utmost.

157
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
There are many social needs here or some of them.

158
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So, interesting way to kick it off.

159
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And those are so obvious, we all know those things.

160
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
We all know that we, if we're hungry, we all know if we, we try to escape from pain.

161
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
We all know we try and find comfort.

162
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
If there's discomfort, I know you especially know that.

163
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But when those things, you can't always provide those things.

164
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And it's, you know what's really interesting.

165
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We're talking about, it's just words, right?

166
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Just words in a book, talking about to make them determined to keep on fighting unto death.

167
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Just words in a book right now.

168
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But if you think about, well, this is World War II, we're getting ready to go and hundreds of thousands of men are going to go and fight unto the death.

169
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And these primitive needs aren't going to be enough to drive.

170
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
So here's some social needs that people have.

171
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Number one, desire for social approval, admiration, recognition, and appreciation.

172
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Two, desire for security, safety, escape from danger and disapproval or fears of all kinds.

173
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Number three, the desire for power, mastery, domination, superiority, and self-assertion.

174
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Number four, desire for adventure, new experience, freedom, escape from futility, humdrum.

175
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Number five, desire for personal response, companionship, friendship, love.

176
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Number six, desire to help and protect others, especially the weak and helpless such as children.

177
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Number seven, desire for a successful achievement, completeness, effectiveness, the desire to do a good job.

178
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Number eight, desire to destroy interference with other desires, aggression and rage.

179
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
That's a, that's a, it's when you hear when I'm reading that list, I think of little people that I've known and you know what was driving them.

180
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah.

181
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I remember thinking this.

182
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So you think of, you think of the military as a group of people.

183
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Even I do, it's a group, you think of, oh, it's an army, it's a battalion, it's a brigade, it's a company, you think of it as a unit that's working together.

184
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But what I will tell you is these, these desires right here are so important for the conduct of warfare, because when you get down to a battalion level, a company level, a platoon level.

185
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
There's individual human beings that are driving that thing forward.

186
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And if you didn't have a leader in charge or it doesn't necessarily have to be the platoon leader, but if you didn't have a platoon sergeant,

187
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
if you didn't have someone in that organization, that was going to drive this thing forward, it wouldn't go anywhere.

188
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
When we do operations overseas, we'd work with the conventional forces overseas.

189
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
There was a guy that was making these things happen.

190
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:17.000
That had that was driven by these types of things, whether, whether something I wanted to shine and get, get noticed,

191
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:27.000
then he's going to take his platoon out, or whether he realized, hey, the best thing I can do for survival ability is to get aggressive and go take the fight to the enemy.

192
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
All these things you can see where they come into play, and you see the same thing in civilian organizations.

193
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:45.000
When you see what's driving me, you know, you ever hear the question of like a rich person, whatever that means, but how much is enough, right?

194
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
There's very few people that become financially successful, that go, okay, you know what I'm good.

195
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Okay, I've got two houses, three houses. I've got a bunch of really nice cars.

196
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I've got a bunch of money in the bank. I'm good. I'm fine. I'm done.

197
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It doesn't happen very often. The folks that they achieve there, and then they look up and go, wait, I can do some more.

198
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And whether that's, you know, just completing a job, like it says, the desire to do a good job, or the desire to help other people,

199
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
hey, the more money I get, the more I can give to other people, like these things are real, and they really drive.

200
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And so when you see a organization get stagnant, you've got to look and say to yourself, which, how can we fuel this desire?

201
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000
How can we allow this mission to answer some of these desires?

202
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Going back to the book, when a military leader calls a man by name and gives him a simple word of commendation for some task well performed.

203
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000
He's appealing to at least two or three natural incentives, calling a man by name shows personal interest, which almost every soldier likes.

204
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:12.000
The commendation is social approval. If the soldier has been feeling insecure, not quite sure of things, then perhaps his sense of security is established by the event of his leaders approval.

205
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
He also has assurance that he has accomplished a job well done. That's, think about that.

206
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:28.000
All it is, and I've talked about that a bunch on here where I say, you know, sometimes leaders don't realize how powerful it is to say, hey, echo really good work on that last video.

207
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000
People don't realize her. Hey, echo really good job holding security last night on that position.

208
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And I've said it's powerful. Now, it's here's why. Here's some of the things that that feeds that person.

209
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000
These desires that they want satisfied get fed when a leader steps down and gives a commendation like that.

210
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Back to the book, social approval is a strong mode of inhuman affairs. And in general, praise is much more effective than blame.

211
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:05.000
The commendation can get results when ballings out fail by ballings out. They mean yelling at people. Reproved tends to leave resentment.

212
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:18.000
This is so smart. Blame is often, however, effective when used in private and in moderation against a man whose quality of performance is high for you will work hard to avoid such criticism.

213
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Anyways, I had the luxury of oftentimes working with people where if they mess something up, they got in trouble, whatever you didn't need to. I didn't need to do anything.

214
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I could basically say, I heard what happened. And that was enough like they were just never they were never going to stop until they corrected that in my eyes.

215
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Yeah, I could see that. A man wants to count to amount to something to feel that he is worthwhile and appreciated.

216
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Promotion citations and distinctions of all kinds helps serve this purpose.

217
00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Fear of the disprovals of others or some other form of punishment works as an incentive, but it is not as good as a steady thing.

218
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Troops coerced into action by snapping, Martinette become anxious, disgruntled jittery. There is a loss in morale and initiative in judgment even in skill.

219
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Men do better in groups whether fighting or working. And one thing that's interesting and we're going to get to there's a section in this part of the book called leadership.

220
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And there's a definite dichotomy and you can hear it here, start to talk about how it sometimes it leans towards the stereotypical military idea of like if I tell you what to do you do it.

221
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.000
But every time it leans towards that, it counters it. It counters it and says, look, if people don't respect you, look, if you're not under people don't understand why they're doing what they're doing.

222
00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Like it always comes back to the true leadership, even though it brushes up and it conferses about some of the stereotypical military leadership, it certainly every time counters them with real true leadership.

223
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Back to the book, a soldier's desire to do a good job. His sense of workmanship is helped whenever he can be allowed to understand the nature of the whole undertaking which he is contributing to which he is contributing.

224
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
A successful leader never signs tasks blindly when he can reveal their larger purpose.

225
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:36.000
By allowing his men to see the significance of their own smaller jobs, he dignifies the lesser tasks by relating them to the large one.

226
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000
This is always make sure your people understand why they're doing what they're doing. That's what it is.

227
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
A successful leader never assigns tasks blindly.

228
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
He wants to make sure that the subordinates understand the nature of the whole undertaking to which he's contributing. This stuff is so important.

229
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Continuing on, morale is the capacity to stay on the job, especially a long hard job with determination and zest.

230
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It is the opposite of apathy. morale needs good health, physical and mental, unless the body is well and vigorous. It is pretty hard to endure hardship and keep up enthusiasm.

231
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:31.000
For teaguen, illness, sap, mental vigor and moral strength. The body does influence the mind. You have to hear that? The body does influence the mind.

232
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Yet there is more to morale than that. Men can carry on with strong determination, sometimes even with zest, through injury, disease and physical privation.

233
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
For that sort of morale, a man needs self-confidence and conviction. He needs to feel sure of himself and emotionally secure.

234
00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:02.000
While there are no simple rules for obtaining this sense of security and confidence, when the world is blowing up around your ears, some of the conditions that bring it are known.

235
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000
It helps to have grown up in a home where there is no quarreling or jealousy. It helps to have friends and to be working or fighting in a group.

236
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
It is essential for the job to seem important for a community related to some of the incentives to human action.

237
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:29.000
A thoughtful man may need to see the job in its larger relations to fit into a philosophy of life, to make it a means of satisfying his own code of what is good and desirable.

238
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:42.000
He may need to take a long range view that extends beyond his own lifetime and perhaps into another world. All incentives to human action are potential morale builders.

239
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:53.000
There is a back and forth relation between work and morale. Not only does morale make soldiers work in fight, working in fighting, keep up their morale.

240
00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Somebody in the last podcast, somebody on Twitter just hammered out quotes from this book.

241
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I was reading them, reading them because I'm reading this whole book and I'm just reading these quotes.

242
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000
There are so many awesome quotes in this book. You can just make a book of quotes from just this book. That's one of them though.

243
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Not only does morale make soldiers work in fight, working in fighting, keep up their morale. It's 100% true, especially in times of emotional stress as in battle does a man need to be doing things.

244
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
As for work alone, men are not naturally lazy. People like to work in forced idolness as a cruel punishment.

245
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000
It has been shown again and again that persons with useful jobs to do in air raids are unlikely to be afraid of bombs.

246
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
They are busy and the morale is good. They carry on because they have important and useful work to do.

247
00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Actually, they feel secure. Even in an air raid, which is a strange place to feel secure, it is the same with the train soldier in the midst of combat.

248
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:14.000
That stuff is brilliant right there. That's brilliant. That's why you have standard operating procedures. That's why you have an immediate action drills when you get attacked by the enemy.

249
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Everyone knows what their job is supposed to be. It doesn't even allow them time to be scared.

250
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I have one parachute failure where I pulled my reserve parachute.

251
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I got to the ground and I got to the ground and I was jumping with at the time.

252
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
We were all kind of the same level except for maybe one guy that had a ton of jumps.

253
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
But all my friends, all my platoon mates were all pro you pulled your reserve.

254
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I was like, yeah, yeah. They were like, bro, was it sketchy?

255
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:59.000
I thought about it and said, no, I did what we trained to do. Arch look grab, look grab, pull pull check check.

256
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I did what the procedure says to do. That's what I was thinking about. That's what I was focused on.

257
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
That's what I did.

258
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
If I didn't have a protocol to follow, it's like my parachute is going to fail.

259
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
I'm going to die in 12 seconds or whatever it is.

260
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
You're dead in 12 seconds if something good doesn't happen real quick.

261
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
It's not even 12 seconds because you're at 2000 feet in your fallen.

262
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Yeah, it's not very much time. You're going to be dead pretty quick as what I'm saying.

263
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Yeah. And I didn't even think about it. And I got to the ground and it wasn't.

264
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
It's like my adrenaline didn't even move.

265
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Right.

266
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Because you're doing what you're supposed to do.

267
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah. Like you. And obviously we're thinking about it.

268
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Not in the situation. So yeah, it's all scary.

269
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
I mean, you pull one shoot. It doesn't work.

270
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And I'm saying outside of the procedure. You know, I'm saying the facts of the reality of the situation.

271
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
You pull one shoot. It doesn't work.

272
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Proof that parachutes don't work to you right then and then that proof.

273
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Oh, if you want to start digging up and you're holding you, you're going to real deep.

274
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
That's what I'm talking about.

275
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
And then now, guess I'm going to issue two only have left.

276
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
One. You already witnessed firsthand one shoot fail.

277
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So far on this parachute jump, you're 100% fail rate.

278
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Your pair of suits.

279
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And only that one more chance.

280
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
One love.

281
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Yeah. Within 10 seconds or whatever.

282
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Yeah.

283
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
You know, so really your brain is like, yeah, this is it.

284
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
You know, if you think of it that way.

285
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
But yeah, if your mind is occupied with, okay,

286
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
procedure procedure procedure and then you just do do do do.

287
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And then it's like, you don't have time to be scared about anything.

288
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.000
No.

289
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Unless they're, you know, if the second one fails, then it's different.

290
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Obviously, but you know, you, you,

291
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
yeah, your mind doesn't have room to start making all these,

292
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
these fearful assessments, you know, action.

293
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Taking action is a real positive thing in so many situations when you start

294
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
be feeling fear.

295
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
You got to do something.

296
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
You got to step up and do something.

297
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
That's like, you know, in, in like a jujitsu tournament or whatever,

298
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
like a competition situation.

299
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Um, I don't want to imagine it be like this.

300
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
If you're talking publicly or whatever before you do it,

301
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
like, okay, before I want to, I used to compete a lot in jiujitsu before.

302
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I'm like, oh, my gosh, like, your anxious and you just, like,

303
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
the feeling beforehand is like way different than when right when he says start.

304
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
When you said start, you don't, you're not even interested in the market.

305
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Yeah, which you do every day anyway.

306
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Kind of thing.

307
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And because you know what to do and that's what your mind is on.

308
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
You're not feeling like, even though you don't even know this guy.

309
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
You never even seen this guy before.

310
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So you don't know what mystery this guy holds, you know?

311
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
I'm just saying that's kind of what you're thinking.

312
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
It's a four people.

313
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
But once you, yeah, for sure, hesitation is the,

314
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
is the moment that you have to overcome for fear.

315
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And action will help you do that.

316
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Back to the book.

317
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
If an officer wants to assess the morale of his own unit,

318
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
there are at least two things for him to do.

319
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
He can listen.

320
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Men will talk and permit it or encourage to,

321
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
and they will sometimes speak freely.

322
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
When they do, they give their leader information.

323
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Not will enable him to answer these questions.

324
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Do the troops feel like they're being well trained.

325
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Well, lead.

326
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Do they think their weapons are adequate?

327
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Do they want to try to get the enemy?

328
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Are they proud of their unit?

329
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Do they have suggestions for its improvement?

330
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Do they have, do they think they get fair treatment?

331
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Fair chances for advancement?

332
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Are they worrying about anything back home?

333
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Or what about what will happen when the war is over?

334
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
From the answers to questions like these,

335
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
an officer can usually estimate accurately the morale of his unit.

336
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
He can also study the behavior of his men.

337
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Are they ready to volunteer for special duty?

338
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Are they frequent violations of discipline?

339
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
How many are AWAL?

340
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
How many in the guard house?

341
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
What is the rate of venereal disease?

342
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
How do they receive bad rumors?

343
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Are there many fights and are the fights based on religious or racial differences?

344
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
The problem is the primary task of leadership.

345
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Actually, it says a primary task.

346
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
The leader, any leader trying to improve the morale of his unit will find these rules helpful.

347
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
So, one of the main things you have to do as a leader is keep morale up.

348
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
No doubt about that.

349
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
If your morale falls apart inside of a team, you're in a bad situation.

350
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And here's some things to help you improve morale.

351
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
One, make each man feel he is needed by his unit that his job is important.

352
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Two, never let a man forget that he is a soldier

353
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
and that a soldier of the United States Army is an important and respected person.

354
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Three, make it very clear that the unit has its own important function in winning.

355
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
The war.

356
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Four, encourage the expression of pride in achievements of the unit.

357
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Five, give commendation and encouragement when it comes in, when it comes in,

358
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
sincerely and appropriately be given for fair appreciation.

359
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Usually works better than condemnation.

360
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Six, never belittle or humiliate a man in front of others,

361
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
except when a military emergency as in battle may require quick correction.

362
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:31.000
When the review is necessary, do it in private and make clear, make it clear that it is the act that is punished not the man.

363
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Seven, keep idleness at a minimum, but make recreation possible.

364
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
A little dichotomy, you have to balance there.

365
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Train each man in every useful task and action that actual combat will require

366
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
and teach him that these habits will reduce his fear when combat comes as well as make him a trained and able fighter.

367
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Nine, let men work together in groups whenever possible because the social relation increases effectiveness and ten,

368
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000
but the soldier on isolated duty feel that he is an indispensable man, not a forgotten one.

369
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Great advice there.

370
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
How often, and this is something I've talked about.

371
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I always, in the way I used to say this is I would say I want every person I put to and think that their job is the most important job in the sealative.

372
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
I want the point man to think hey, point man, if you don't know where you're going, everyone's lost.

373
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
You got the most important job and the put to and commander, hey, this is your patrol, your the guy in charge,

374
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
you're the got the most important job and the radio man, hey, radio man, if something goes sideways out there,

375
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:48.000
it's you with your ability to communicate with air assets and other support elements that are going to save everyone.

376
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
You're the most important guy.

377
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And then the medic, hey, if someone gets shot, you're the guy, it's like I go right on down the line.

378
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Everyone thinks, and what's what's.

379
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I'm not, I'm not lying to them.

380
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I'm actually telling them the truth.

381
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
I'm actually telling them the truth in critical situations.

382
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Someone in that platoon is going to be the most important person.

383
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
It's not the same all the time.

384
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I'm telling them the truth.

385
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
The truth is, if you're the radio man and you're getting overwhelming enemy fire and that

386
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
radio man can reach out and drop bombs on the enemy, he's the most important guy in the platoon without question.

387
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
If you're trying to get to an extract point who's going to get to get your platoon out of there,

388
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
then the point man is the one that knows where he's going and no one else knows,

389
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
that point man's the most important person.

390
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
When you're in a machine gun fight, when you're in a gun fight,

391
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
it's the machine gunners that are to lay down fire and allow you to cover and move and

392
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
close with and destroy the enemy.

393
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
It's the machine gunners, most important.

394
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
You take away the machine guns and assume, you got a real problem on your hand.

395
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
So I'm not lying to anyone.

396
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
I'm telling them the truth.

397
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
The truth is, you have the most important job in this platoon.

398
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
That's the truth.

399
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
And when people hear that man, it's important too.

400
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Yeah.

401
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And he goes back, the book goes back and making sure that everyone understands how important

402
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
what the unit is doing to the strategic victory.

403
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And talking about pride and unity,

404
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
especially the we were overseas and army units would have their battle streamers that

405
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
they bring historical documents and hang them up in the wall and they're in their

406
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
make shift up center.

407
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
From World War II, hanging them up, post your paper or paper clippings from World War II.

408
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And they're hanging them up.

409
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
This is who are unit.

410
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
This is what we've done.

411
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
We are upholding tradition.

412
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
We have pride in what we do.

413
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So awesome.

414
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It's a real thing.

415
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Next little section is about zest.

416
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Zest is the fabric from which morale is made.

417
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Zest, vigor of spirit, love of life coupled with a willingness and eagerness to risk

418
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
life itself in a good undertaking.

419
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000
A spirit of high adventure that turns a difficult mission into a rare chance to show the

420
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
stuff of which men are made.

421
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
This is the weapon that makes a military unit unbeatable.

422
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Think of a mission as a rare chance to show the stuff of which men are made.

423
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Highly motivated.

424
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Zest depends first upon physical fitness.

425
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
It demands a sharp appetite that will make a soldier eat plentifully and digest his food.

426
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
It requires physical exercise that brings plenty of oxygen into the lungs and plenty of red blood circulating

427
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
to the brain and back to the hands and legs.

428
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
If a man is to meet the sunrise with any sort of spirit for the new day, he must have slept at night,

429
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000
sound and understood by anxious dreams within him or by vermin in his bed.

430
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Fatigue can quickly reduce a fighting spirit.

431
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
This symptoms of mental fatigue, whether in the air or on the ground are a stalinist,

432
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
a lack of interest in the job to be done, lack of enthusiasm, enthusiasm, a heaviness of limbs,

433
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000
eyelids, even of the will that makes it well-nigh impossible to drag through the day's duties.

434
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And with it shortness of temper, irritability and the blues.

435
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.000
All leaders have to be constantly on guard against this insidious, spiritual, fifth columnists

436
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
among their men and among themselves.

437
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Regardless of how invaluable the man when fatigue is made at this attack on his fitness,

438
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
he must have relief.

439
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
He must be required to sleep, to take respite from responsibility, to get away from the strain

440
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
he has been under, otherwise the price is a psychological casualty.

441
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And the more important the man, the greater the cost to the army.

442
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Make sure you people are getting some rest as much as you can.

443
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And again, this book counters these things all the time by saying,

444
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
hey, there's sometimes where you're not going to be able to rest.

445
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
That's the way it is.

446
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
So then what you have to do is you have to understand if to understand that.

447
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
That's what this book is about.

448
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
You have to understand now what are the risks involved.

449
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Now we've got a unit that is severely fatigued in battle-worn.

450
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
What are the risks?

451
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And not going to be able to fight as well as they did when they were fresh.

452
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
If you don't know that, perhaps you send them in the front line to another battle.

453
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
If you know it, you take another group that was in the rear and you send them in the front line,

454
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
you let the guys that are fatigued be the reserves.

455
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
That's why if they know and understand these things.

456
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Back to the book, excessive physical discomfort can also eventually

457
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
dead in all zest for life and for battle.

458
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Men can fight with their socks stiff with dirt or frozen to their feet with

459
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
hands so swollen and crack that they can barely pull a trigger.

460
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
They have fought when the baths are unknown and shaves are almost as scarce

461
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
when marching must be done through seas of mud and clothing never dries.

462
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And when the eyes are cut and lungs are choked with never settling crowds of dust and sand,

463
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
men have fought and are fighting under such conditions.

464
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
But it takes an unquenchable spirit to keep it zest when things are like this.

465
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Whole armies have shown this spirit, but such conditions prolonged,

466
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
get in zest in the end and therefore must be relieved whenever possible.

467
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
When a man has his first encounter with the immediate threat of death,

468
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
when he must kill and see men killed, when he must steal himself to hear the unheeded cries

469
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
of the mortally wounded and endure the stench of battle, a man may become sick

470
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000
in his very vitals. He may lose interest in his food and yet this will be no sign of

471
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
squeamishness. The toughest of leather next may feel intensely the inward revolting

472
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
and horror the battlefield can provoke.

473
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
The defenses against these physical and mental foes of the spirit are faith in good

474
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
leaders, a loyalty to them and to comrades and a shoulder to shoulder, feeling of

475
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
solidarity with the other men of the outfit.

476
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I can go anywhere and stand anything my captain and the rest of my outfit can.

477
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Got to set that good example.

478
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Fear, ally or traitor.

479
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
The first battle, the first experience of having an enemy machine gun aimed at you,

480
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
the first time an airplane swoops low to lay its deadly eggs in your particular

481
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
patch of ground. That is an experience anticipated by the young soldier with mingle

482
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
dread and eagerness. He is eager by that time to get at the enemy.

483
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
He is learned a great deal about the science of war and wants to use this knowledge

484
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
to wipe out the enemy in gain victory.

485
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
But he always wonders, every man does just how he will behave when the time comes.

486
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
He doesn't feel like a hero.

487
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
If he is honest, completely honest with himself, he knows he will be scared, terrified.

488
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
The experienced soldier who has been through all this the first time and many other times

489
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
has found out for certain that every man going into battle is scared.

490
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
His hands tremble, his throat is dry, he must swallow constantly because his heart isn't as

491
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
mouth. He does idiotic things like looking at his watch every few seconds or examining his

492
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.000
heart. He is a powerful soldier. He is the only one so disturbed but it is true of all the

493
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
veteran as well.

494
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And it is true of the enemy.

495
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Germans and Japs get just as scared as Americans in British.

496
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000
The bad moments do not come during actual combat, however, but in the time of tense

497
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
waiting just before.

498
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
As soon as the frightened man is able to go into action to do something effective against the

499
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
enemy, especially if it involves a violent physical action, his fright is apt to be

500
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
dispeled or forgotten because he is too busy fighting to remember it.

501
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And this is great propaganda to talk about because what they are basically, they are

502
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
doing this book to young soldiers that are getting ready to go and fight.

503
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And what they are telling them is look, you are going to be scared, everyone is scared.

504
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:50.000
So that way they don't get scared and freak out because they are scared.

505
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Airplane pilots who had distinguished themselves in action against the Japanese said when asked

506
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
whether they were scared during those moments of acute peril, why I don't know.

507
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
There was too much to do, we didn't have time to think.

508
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
We are scared at first, wrote a member of a torpedoed ship.

509
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Sure we were.

510
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
But when the torpedo hit us, we forgot all about it.

511
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
There wasn't much time and then there was much work to do.

512
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
It's another thing when you, it's going to go into this, but when you are a leader

513
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000
and things are going bad, give people something to do, give them a direction, give them an order, say,

514
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
look, are this what we are going to do right now?

515
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I don't know about that, but there is what we are going to do.

516
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
We are going to move all these chairs and get them into this, whatever, you figure something to do, and do it.

517
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Encounters with the enemy are most terrifying when they are unfamiliar.

518
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
The soldier becomes used to gunfire to explosions and to the sight and order of death.

519
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
As the soldier becomes used to gunfire explosions and the sight of older,

520
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
the soldier of death, he gradually acquires the power to meet these things more stoically.

521
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
He does not actually lose his fear but learns to ignore it sufficiently to keep his attention

522
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
only on the business of combat.

523
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And if he has in his trained hands a good weapon which he knows will put the enemy out of action.

524
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
This gives him a feeling of confidence, a sense of power that in large measure our ways is fear.

525
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
He knows it will soon be the other fellow's turn to be scared.

526
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Fear when experienced is intensely uncomfortable and seems often to be incapacitating.

527
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000
If the period of fright is prolonged, a man may feel that his nerves are all shot by it.

528
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
For fear is disintegrating, demoralizing, it shatters morale.

529
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
The soldier may be rooted to the spot, paralyzed or immobilized by fear.

530
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Nevertheless, such awful moments before an attack, when each second seems an hour,

531
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
may actually be useful to any soldier.

532
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
They may really add to his efficiency.

533
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
For fear is the body's preparation for action.

534
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
The heart pounds faster, blood pumping more rapidly to the arms and legs and brain where oxygen is needed.

535
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
The lungs do their part by quick and breathing.

536
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Blood pressure goes up, adrenaline which is nature's own shot in the arm is poured liberally into the bloodstream.

537
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Settle changes in body chemistry automatically affected by powerful emotion.

538
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
The soldier's nerves protect the soldier in action in ways he would never think of if he had to plan them himself.

539
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
His blood clots more readily.

540
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
He loses temporarily sense of fatigue even though he may have been dog-tired.

541
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:45.000
It is sometimes difficult for a tense fright and soldier to get started into combat to begin the action will relieve his fear.

542
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
That part is taken care of by army training and discipline.

543
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Months of training have taught the soldier to respond from habit to definite battle orders,

544
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
even though in battle commands often cannot be given as in training.

545
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
It has become second nature to him to carry out his own job as a member of the fighting team.

546
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
So there you go.

547
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:15.000
This is also important when you recognize, when you know what's going to happen, it allows you to not be scared that you're scared.

548
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Right? So all of a sudden your breathing starts going faster and you feel the adrenaline going through your system.

549
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
If you don't know what's happening, it might catch you off guard.

550
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
But if you know what's happening, well, cool. That's my adrenaline.

551
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
If you know when you have a, can you feel adrenaline actually go through your system?

552
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Like, let's say you're driving and somebody pulls out in front of you almost crashed into it.

553
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Right? And you can, you can feel the adrenaline go down your arms and duets. Are you felt that before?

554
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Oh yeah. So if you don't have any idea what that is.

555
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And it happens, you might scare you a little bit.

556
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Yes, you know what it is. You're kind of, you're kind of good with it.

557
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Yeah, it's like you, it's like people, I mean, I don't know if I don't know the actual process, but you know how like,

558
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.000
yeah, when you tense up before you do something, right? And feel your heart beating all fast and stuff like that.

559
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
If you know, okay, you know, I'm getting excited because of this, you know, event.

560
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
That's big in my mind or whatever.

561
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
But if you're like, if you don't know, or you're like, what I'm losing it, I feel like I'm losing it right now.

562
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
You know, like if you're, I don't know, you know, if you're about to go skydiving or something different for you obviously,

563
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
but the normal person, for the jump out of an airplane, you know?

564
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Yeah, and that's what's a lot of the military training that you go through is to get yourself.

565
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Hey, when you, when you start fast-roading, roping out of helicopter, when you're repelling off of the, off of the side of a cliff or out of a window in an urban environment or your parachuting,

566
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
static land parachute, free fall parachute. All these things that you do, when you first start doing them,

567
00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000
there's like an adrenaline rush, but you just get used to it. And so then by the time you're getting shot at,

568
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
you're like, oh yeah, I know what this is. I'm good. I can carry on.

569
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Yeah.

570
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Back to the book, no matter how distracted, you mind may be by unfamiliar,

571
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000
interrogating sites and smells and sounds, you act from sheer force of habit.

572
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:26.000
In fact, it is habits which take care of a man if he is too frightened to think clearly, like the habit of diving for cover when bombs come down.

573
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Then, presently, you are an action. You are a fighting. You are at last using your force against the foe.

574
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:41.000
No more are you a depressed frightened soul. Fierce forgotten provided your well trained.

575
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Good to teach people the, how to respond in certain situations. Like you didn't, you know, when he comes to the self defense.

576
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Hey, if you get attacked, here's what happens. Here's what you do. When they just have that plan, that's worth a lot.

577
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Just having a plan is worth a lot. So many grabs you here. This is your reaction.

578
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So many grabs you there. This is your reaction. You know, those things, they, if you see them out of context, like if you watch a

579
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Gracie self defense video out of context, you'll say, well, it's going to be hard for that particular movie.

580
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
If you go watch like a Macdojo self defense, then you go, that's just, obviously, that's never going to work.

581
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000
But even you want your Gracie self defense thing out of context, you don't understand it. You might be like, well, I don't know how that's going to work.

582
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:34.000
But it's a plan that you're going to take action. And it isn't effective plan, by the way. It's not like it's not a good plan.

583
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000
But the fact that you are going to immediately take action, you're going to respond to the event immediately.

584
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.000
It's going to put you in a totally different place. And a much, much infinitely better place than I just got, you know, someone just grabbed me by

585
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:58.000
the head or by the arm. And I have no idea what to do. That's a bad situation. Then that fear is going to rise. If you have a reaction, boom, you're going to action.

586
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And then the, he talks about like training right, if you, you know, the well trained person. It's like you're just so, because training is just like repetition.

587
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Right, all these different scenarios. So you're so used to it. It's like nothing. You're so like used to this stimulus or, okay, remember when you're in elementary school, they do a fire drill.

588
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Every whatever they do. And you just calmly stand up and walk out and sing, well, by all I, you know, it's like it's kind of boring in a way.

589
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:35.000
But I mean, we never had a fire in my elementary school, but I'm imagining that if the, once you heard, it was a certain spuse, a specific bell that went on.

590
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
It instead of the regular bell, it would go ding ding ding ding.

591
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:49.000
It was obviously a fire drill, you know, when you heard the bell. So it was so ingrained in, well, in me, anyway, I'm sure everyone else felt the same way as a kid.

592
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:58.000
When you heard that, you were like, you just sort of automatically like a zombie stand up and why not, like, you know, it was almost like, yeah, it's like so automatic.

593
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
So I'm assuming that like, if a fire actually happened,

594
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:14.000
you're instinct would be to do it. Just do it. Yeah, normally, you would have run and scatter and be all crazy, whatever you just because you're so quote unquote trained just to do it, you know, completely.

595
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
I guarantee if you look back in the history of school fires,

596
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
at some point there was a school fire before they did that training and everyone panicked and freaked out and people died.

597
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Yeah, maybe people didn't die, but people said, oh, that could have gone bad. And so then, oh, guess what you do, you rehearse it, you trained this bell means stand up, moving the direction, go out this door,

598
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000
assemble in the recess area for ad count. Yeah. In fact, they're remembering college, someone pulled the fire alarm.

599
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Mm-hmm. It was, it ended up to be a prank, but everyone sort of thought that, oh, this building is on fire right now, this is in the middle of the night.

600
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I don't think I've ever believed a fire alarm.

601
00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:07.000
And I'm trying to think, if, no way, I've been in one situation where there was a legit fire, but I was like completely, everyone just thought I was super cool and calm, but I was actually just did it.

602
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
And then finally, I was, yeah, we need to get out of here.

603
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Yeah. But, yeah, most, because you think about, I've experienced a lot of fire alarms and there's a very low percentage of them that were real fires.

604
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Yeah. Yeah. And that's, well, I mean, I guess that's an added element though. Like if, if you're trained, but you never think it'll ever ever happen.

605
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000
I don't know, I think I would think that'd be a little bit different, because almost like you run the risk of when it actually does happen and you smell smoke or see the smoke or see the flames or whatever, that might

606
00:53:38.000 --> 00:54:07.000
you do some added element that you weren't expecting. You know? Yeah. So that might jam you up. But nonetheless, I think, like when you go through, I remember there was a fire, but it was like way and a different building and it was just procedure, everyone, I evacuated, you know, kind of thing, and we found out it was just later or whatever. So yeah, I don't think I ever had the stimulus of the fire, but in college or whatever, when I did think that it was on fire, I didn't hear it or I mean,

607
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.74
here it or I mean I didn't smell it or see it or nothing like that.

608
00:54:09.74 --> 00:54:10.58
That's what I was looking at.

609
00:54:10.58 --> 00:54:14.02
I thought obviously we're in no threat.

610
00:54:14.02 --> 00:54:16.06
Yeah, because if there's no fire around you,

611
00:54:16.06 --> 00:54:17.62
then you think that time to get out.

612
00:54:17.62 --> 00:54:18.46
Yeah.

613
00:54:18.46 --> 00:54:21.18
But it was still the same like, no one was panicking.

614
00:54:21.18 --> 00:54:22.02
It seemed like it.

615
00:54:22.02 --> 00:54:22.86
It seemed like it.

616
00:54:22.86 --> 00:54:24.34
But I'm just saying there's no,

617
00:54:24.34 --> 00:54:26.82
there's no like what we're talking about here,

618
00:54:26.82 --> 00:54:30.26
there's no incentive to run because it's just the alarm

619
00:54:30.26 --> 00:54:32.06
and you fall the procedure.

620
00:54:32.06 --> 00:54:33.06
Yeah.

621
00:54:33.06 --> 00:54:33.90
Well, yeah.

622
00:54:33.90 --> 00:54:37.66
And then if you let's say you're just lining up in a single file

623
00:54:37.66 --> 00:54:41.24
line calmly because you're supposed to do it calmly,

624
00:54:41.24 --> 00:54:45.30
meanwhile the guy behind you is like choking and getting

625
00:54:45.30 --> 00:54:47.46
his shirts on fire.

626
00:54:47.46 --> 00:54:50.82
Right, you're gonna run straight up.

627
00:54:50.82 --> 00:54:53.42
I might try and help him actually.

628
00:54:53.42 --> 00:54:55.42
Give me a little stop drop.

629
00:54:55.42 --> 00:54:56.42
So drop in the road.

630
00:54:56.42 --> 00:54:57.22
It's old school year.

631
00:54:57.22 --> 00:54:58.10
It's been helping out.

632
00:54:58.10 --> 00:54:59.10
Yeah.

633
00:54:59.10 --> 00:55:01.70
Well, I'd throw the paint fire.

634
00:55:01.70 --> 00:55:03.90
Good play.

635
00:55:03.90 --> 00:55:04.90
All right.

636
00:55:04.90 --> 00:55:06.50
Goes into some specifics here.

637
00:55:06.50 --> 00:55:07.90
How to fight fear.

638
00:55:07.90 --> 00:55:10.90
One action dispels fear do something.

639
00:55:10.90 --> 00:55:13.46
And the time is suspense when men are already

640
00:55:13.46 --> 00:55:15.26
for action, but are waiting for the signal start.

641
00:55:15.26 --> 00:55:17.30
Fear is at its height.

642
00:55:17.30 --> 00:55:19.22
If the period of waiting is prolonged,

643
00:55:19.22 --> 00:55:22.10
perhaps delay until a weather changes,

644
00:55:22.10 --> 00:55:24.94
the time should be occupied with preparation for action.

645
00:55:24.94 --> 00:55:29.30
Fight fear with necessary or main, you factured work.

646
00:55:29.30 --> 00:55:33.22
And when expecting combat when waiting for enemy bombers to return,

647
00:55:33.22 --> 00:55:35.18
man you factured work.

648
00:55:35.18 --> 00:55:38.30
Like, hey, you gotta make something up for people to do.

649
00:55:38.30 --> 00:55:39.30
Seems lazy.

650
00:55:39.30 --> 00:55:40.70
Seems yeah.

651
00:55:40.70 --> 00:55:41.78
And it's not hard.

652
00:55:41.78 --> 00:55:43.58
In combat, there's always something to get ready.

653
00:55:43.58 --> 00:55:45.90
So it's not hard to say, all right, what we're gonna do

654
00:55:45.90 --> 00:55:47.86
is we're gonna set up a couple other bunkers.

655
00:55:47.86 --> 00:55:48.74
Let's fill some sandbags.

656
00:55:48.74 --> 00:55:49.58
Cool.

657
00:55:49.58 --> 00:55:50.70
We're all working.

658
00:55:50.70 --> 00:55:51.54
There's always a reason.

659
00:55:51.54 --> 00:55:53.06
It doesn't even have to be manufactured.

660
00:55:53.06 --> 00:55:54.38
It can be real.

661
00:55:54.38 --> 00:55:57.34
Two physical contact with friends, helps.

662
00:55:57.34 --> 00:55:59.50
Men shoot if at all possible stay within sight

663
00:55:59.50 --> 00:56:01.82
of in time of peril, but not bunched up

664
00:56:01.82 --> 00:56:03.90
enough to become a bomb target.

665
00:56:03.90 --> 00:56:06.70
Just the presence of another man not far off with no

666
00:56:06.70 --> 00:56:09.06
when no word is spoken minimizes fear.

667
00:56:09.06 --> 00:56:11.38
Three role calls help men in peril

668
00:56:11.38 --> 00:56:13.42
should be reminded that they are not alone.

669
00:56:14.42 --> 00:56:17.02
Four knowledge is power over fear.

670
00:56:17.02 --> 00:56:19.26
Surprises the most important element in battle,

671
00:56:19.26 --> 00:56:22.30
thus men should be constantly kept informed

672
00:56:22.30 --> 00:56:24.50
of the dangers they may meet.

673
00:56:25.54 --> 00:56:27.30
That one could be a little bit of a trick.

674
00:56:27.30 --> 00:56:31.42
You work you on because sometimes people would get

675
00:56:31.42 --> 00:56:34.62
a little freaked out when they would hear

676
00:56:34.62 --> 00:56:36.58
about what the enemy can do.

677
00:56:36.58 --> 00:56:37.98
You know what I'm saying?

678
00:56:37.98 --> 00:56:40.26
Like I'll tell you one thing, when we were in

679
00:56:40.26 --> 00:56:44.50
Ramadi, there was a lot of ideas, a lot of ideas.

680
00:56:44.50 --> 00:56:47.62
And if someone would come to visit us,

681
00:56:48.62 --> 00:56:51.94
and they wanted to come on an operation with us,

682
00:56:51.94 --> 00:56:55.06
we would give like the slightly longer IED brief

683
00:56:55.06 --> 00:56:58.34
so that they understood the threat.

684
00:56:58.34 --> 00:57:00.98
It wasn't always helpful for them psychologically.

685
00:57:00.98 --> 00:57:04.34
You could see as the brief went on,

686
00:57:04.34 --> 00:57:07.38
you could see I would watch the reactions on people's faces

687
00:57:07.38 --> 00:57:10.02
and you could see them start getting really concerned.

688
00:57:10.02 --> 00:57:13.46
Because it's just my EOD guy standing out.

689
00:57:13.46 --> 00:57:16.90
Here's the bomb from this vehicle, yesterday,

690
00:57:16.90 --> 00:57:18.42
this is what it did to the vehicle day before.

691
00:57:18.42 --> 00:57:19.78
Here's what it looked like.

692
00:57:19.78 --> 00:57:20.66
Here's one that they found.

693
00:57:20.66 --> 00:57:21.62
Here's one that they did.

694
00:57:21.62 --> 00:57:24.18
And it was just a slide show of bombs.

695
00:57:24.18 --> 00:57:25.62
Yeah.

696
00:57:25.62 --> 00:57:27.94
In the city that you're about to go into,

697
00:57:27.94 --> 00:57:31.46
which is not a big city, it's two miles, three miles across.

698
00:57:31.46 --> 00:57:33.78
It's not like we're going, and there's a small chance.

699
00:57:33.78 --> 00:57:36.90
And by the way, there's seven to 10 IEDs detonated a day

700
00:57:36.90 --> 00:57:39.62
on route Michigan one road going across Ramadi.

701
00:57:39.62 --> 00:57:44.58
So it was when you tell when people would come to Ramadi

702
00:57:44.58 --> 00:57:47.86
and they'd get that brief, it would always be sort of an interesting

703
00:57:47.86 --> 00:57:48.98
look on their face.

704
00:57:48.98 --> 00:57:53.62
I would see people tap in their toe, shake in their leg.

705
00:57:53.62 --> 00:57:54.66
You know what I'm saying?

706
00:57:54.66 --> 00:57:55.66
You know what I'm saying?

707
00:57:55.66 --> 00:57:59.38
I would watch for that and I'd see people just getting all nervous.

708
00:57:59.38 --> 00:58:00.82
Because hey, it's a real thing.

709
00:58:00.82 --> 00:58:02.34
I mean, I get it.

710
00:58:02.34 --> 00:58:06.74
But the guys from TU Bruiser were kind of adjusted to it.

711
00:58:06.74 --> 00:58:10.26
You know, they were adjusted to it.

712
00:58:10.26 --> 00:58:11.62
Back to the book.

713
00:58:11.62 --> 00:58:12.98
Control of action helps.

714
00:58:12.98 --> 00:58:16.34
To be afraid does not mean that a man must act afraid.

715
00:58:16.34 --> 00:58:17.94
Oh, this one's so good.

716
00:58:17.94 --> 00:58:23.06
To be afraid does not mean that a man must act afraid.

717
00:58:23.06 --> 00:58:26.42
Fear is contagious when it is expressed in action.

718
00:58:26.42 --> 00:58:29.14
If a man goes to pieces and becomes panicky,

719
00:58:29.14 --> 00:58:31.62
he must be removed from the sight of other men if that is

720
00:58:31.62 --> 00:58:32.66
all possible.

721
00:58:32.66 --> 00:58:37.46
It is each man's responsibility to control the signs of his own fear

722
00:58:37.46 --> 00:58:41.62
if he can so as to spare the others.

723
00:58:41.62 --> 00:58:45.06
If he can manage to act as though he were calm,

724
00:58:45.06 --> 00:58:48.74
he may actually become more calm.

725
00:58:48.74 --> 00:58:51.46
At any rate, the opposite of true is true,

726
00:58:51.46 --> 00:58:53.62
giving him the fear tends to increase it.

727
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:01.22
There you go.

728
00:59:01.22 --> 00:59:03.30
It's straightforward.

729
00:59:03.30 --> 00:59:06.74
Don't be shaking your leg during the brief.

730
00:59:06.74 --> 00:59:06.98
Yeah.

731
00:59:06.98 --> 00:59:07.86
You know what I'm saying?

732
00:59:07.86 --> 00:59:09.94
Don't show that you're scared.

733
00:59:09.94 --> 00:59:12.66
Because that gets contagious and other people will start

734
00:59:12.66 --> 00:59:13.54
feeling like you're afraid.

735
00:59:13.54 --> 00:59:15.70
You got to act like no factor.

736
00:59:15.70 --> 00:59:16.42
Whatever.

737
00:59:16.42 --> 00:59:18.34
You think they can blow me up, bring it.

738
00:59:18.34 --> 00:59:19.14
Yeah.

739
00:59:19.14 --> 00:59:21.14
Bring it.

740
00:59:21.14 --> 00:59:24.18
You can't be panicking and freaking out.

741
00:59:25.54 --> 00:59:30.34
And each man is responsible to keep themselves in check,

742
00:59:30.34 --> 00:59:31.54
keep their fear in check.

743
00:59:31.54 --> 00:59:33.78
And just because your afraid doesn't mean you get to act like it.

744
00:59:33.78 --> 00:59:35.22
Yeah.

745
00:59:35.22 --> 00:59:36.18
Is that kind of like one?

746
00:59:36.18 --> 00:59:37.78
When your kids get older, well,

747
00:59:37.78 --> 00:59:40.18
when your kids get older, you have to have that conversation with them.

748
00:59:40.18 --> 00:59:41.22
No, have that conversation.

749
00:59:41.22 --> 00:59:43.46
You don't get to act like you're scared.

750
00:59:43.46 --> 00:59:44.66
You don't even get to act like you're mad.

751
00:59:44.66 --> 00:59:46.02
That's why we play normal face.

752
00:59:46.02 --> 00:59:46.42
Right.

753
00:59:46.42 --> 00:59:47.78
You don't get to act like that.

754
00:59:48.58 --> 00:59:50.26
You think you're going to get hit in the head with this thing,

755
00:59:50.26 --> 00:59:51.70
and you can go deal with it.

756
00:59:51.70 --> 00:59:52.18
Yeah.

757
00:59:52.18 --> 00:59:52.98
Put it on the inside.

758
00:59:52.98 --> 00:59:56.74
You know, like when your kids, when they're young,

759
00:59:56.74 --> 00:59:59.06
and they fall down, right?

760
00:59:59.06 --> 01:00:01.06
You're kid, you saw, yeah, daughter, whatever.

761
01:00:01.06 --> 01:00:01.86
They fall down.

762
01:00:01.86 --> 01:00:02.66
Best thing you can do.

763
01:00:02.66 --> 01:00:03.06
Right.

764
01:00:03.06 --> 01:00:03.86
Laugh out of them.

765
01:00:03.86 --> 01:00:04.66
Or yes.

766
01:00:04.66 --> 01:00:06.34
And it's funny because it's like,

767
01:00:06.34 --> 01:00:07.30
That's awesome.

768
01:00:07.30 --> 01:00:09.46
Yeah, that's a one that I do.

769
01:00:09.46 --> 01:00:10.66
Yeah.

770
01:00:10.66 --> 01:00:13.46
But there's that split second when they fall,

771
01:00:13.46 --> 01:00:14.66
they're stunned.

772
01:00:14.66 --> 01:00:15.46
They're shocked.

773
01:00:15.46 --> 01:00:18.34
And they look at you with like, how am I supposed to act?

774
01:00:18.34 --> 01:00:18.98
I'm afraid.

775
01:00:18.98 --> 01:00:22.02
So if you're like, oh my god, run up to him.

776
01:00:22.02 --> 01:00:22.98
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

777
01:00:22.98 --> 01:00:23.86
I think it's okay.

778
01:00:23.86 --> 01:00:26.42
Every time that noise that you just made,

779
01:00:26.42 --> 01:00:27.62
Yeah.

780
01:00:27.62 --> 01:00:32.42
is my wife is the absolute greatest at this noise.

781
01:00:32.42 --> 01:00:33.46
Oh.

782
01:00:34.58 --> 01:00:36.42
She can make a grown person.

783
01:00:36.42 --> 01:00:37.06
Yeah.

784
01:00:37.06 --> 01:00:39.78
Make you think that you should start crying and freaking out.

785
01:00:39.78 --> 01:00:40.10
Oh, yeah.

786
01:00:40.10 --> 01:00:41.78
Because she just gives the.

787
01:00:41.78 --> 01:00:42.98
Oh, yeah.

788
01:00:42.98 --> 01:00:43.38
Yeah.

789
01:00:43.38 --> 01:00:44.18
Yeah.

790
01:00:44.18 --> 01:00:45.62
He's got a lot of, yeah.

791
01:00:45.62 --> 01:00:47.22
She caused a so much alarm.

792
01:00:47.22 --> 01:00:47.62
Yeah.

793
01:00:47.62 --> 01:00:50.98
I've been married to her for over 20 years.

794
01:00:50.98 --> 01:00:51.78
Yeah.

795
01:00:51.78 --> 01:00:53.30
And we'll be driving.

796
01:00:53.30 --> 01:00:55.54
Oh, just just spend time to get it.

797
01:00:55.54 --> 01:00:56.66
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

798
01:00:56.66 --> 01:01:00.02
We're not, we're not talking like a rainstorm on the highway.

799
01:01:00.02 --> 01:01:01.62
Going 60 miles an hour.

800
01:01:01.62 --> 01:01:05.62
We're talking just cruising just through like a normal area.

801
01:01:06.90 --> 01:01:10.02
And I'll just be, you know, relax, thinking,

802
01:01:10.02 --> 01:01:11.94
train attention, all of a sudden.

803
01:01:11.94 --> 01:01:16.10
And you know what she'll say at the end of it?

804
01:01:16.10 --> 01:01:18.58
She'll go, look at that.

805
01:01:19.46 --> 01:01:20.50
All over there.

806
01:01:20.50 --> 01:01:22.34
It's got such a cool thing.

807
01:01:22.34 --> 01:01:24.02
And I'm thinking, you know,

808
01:01:24.02 --> 01:01:25.14
you know, can you?

809
01:01:25.14 --> 01:01:26.50
No, I've been telling her not to do this.

810
01:01:26.50 --> 01:01:28.34
But it's an instinct that she has.

811
01:01:28.34 --> 01:01:28.66
Yeah.

812
01:01:28.66 --> 01:01:30.90
It's an instinct that my wife has.

813
01:01:30.90 --> 01:01:31.22
Yeah.

814
01:01:31.22 --> 01:01:32.50
I think this.

815
01:01:32.50 --> 01:01:36.26
And it's, and now, you know, my son doing his driving.

816
01:01:36.26 --> 01:01:37.94
Like he got his license.

817
01:01:37.94 --> 01:01:38.90
So he can drive.

818
01:01:38.90 --> 01:01:39.54
Oh.

819
01:01:39.54 --> 01:01:40.82
And he came home the other day.

820
01:01:40.82 --> 01:01:42.74
He's like, man, he's a dad.

821
01:01:43.86 --> 01:01:44.90
I'm driving with mom.

822
01:01:44.90 --> 01:01:46.02
It's kind of scary.

823
01:01:46.02 --> 01:01:48.58
And I'm like, why would it she do?

824
01:01:48.58 --> 01:01:49.86
I was thinking she was driving.

825
01:01:49.86 --> 01:01:51.62
He was no I was driving.

826
01:01:51.62 --> 01:01:55.94
But I drove by like a road.

827
01:01:55.94 --> 01:01:56.58
Mm.

828
01:01:56.58 --> 01:01:57.38
And she was.

829
01:01:57.38 --> 01:01:58.42
Yeah.

830
01:01:58.42 --> 01:01:59.62
Can you get that tense?

831
01:01:59.62 --> 01:02:00.42
Yeah.

832
01:02:00.42 --> 01:02:01.06
Oh, yeah.

833
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:02.26
Don't act scared.

834
01:02:02.26 --> 01:02:03.06
Don't do it.

835
01:02:03.06 --> 01:02:07.06
And for some reason, my wife's, that's an emotional noise

836
01:02:07.06 --> 01:02:07.62
that she makes.

837
01:02:07.62 --> 01:02:08.42
It's not fear.

838
01:02:08.42 --> 01:02:09.62
It's like excitement.

839
01:02:09.62 --> 01:02:10.90
It's like, yeah, it's everything.

840
01:02:10.90 --> 01:02:14.18
Sometimes it's like, I see something cute too.

841
01:02:14.18 --> 01:02:16.18
You know, just something that's not even me.

842
01:02:16.18 --> 01:02:18.42
I see some, why would you do this?

843
01:02:18.42 --> 01:02:20.26
If you see something cute, why would you go,

844
01:02:20.26 --> 01:02:22.82
I don't do that noise.

845
01:02:22.82 --> 01:02:24.02
That's a wrong noise.

846
01:02:24.02 --> 01:02:27.62
That noise means I'm about to get in brace for impact.

847
01:02:27.62 --> 01:02:29.14
That's what that noise means.

848
01:02:29.14 --> 01:02:32.10
Um, noise means I'm about to get tea bone.

849
01:02:32.10 --> 01:02:32.74
Yeah.

850
01:02:32.74 --> 01:02:35.70
And I have a split second to accelerate out of the kill zone.

851
01:02:35.70 --> 01:02:36.10
Yeah.

852
01:02:36.10 --> 01:02:37.30
That's what that noise means.

853
01:02:37.30 --> 01:02:40.50
It doesn't mean book it that cat.

854
01:02:42.50 --> 01:02:43.38
Stop it.

855
01:02:43.38 --> 01:02:44.66
Well, man, please.

856
01:02:44.66 --> 01:02:45.46
Yeah.

857
01:02:45.46 --> 01:02:48.26
And I don't know if that's a wife thing or what?

858
01:02:48.26 --> 01:02:50.34
Because my wife is the same thing the same way.

859
01:02:50.34 --> 01:02:54.90
And it actually is exactly what this book said where you get like act

860
01:02:54.90 --> 01:02:57.54
scared because it'll cause other sex scared essentially, right?

861
01:02:57.54 --> 01:03:00.02
No, in do Span Aquedever, which because that's what it did.

862
01:03:00.02 --> 01:03:01.38
That's what you're like for sure.

863
01:03:01.38 --> 01:03:02.02
Yeah, for sure.

864
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:05.54
That's what my wife does to me, which is like on the computer.

865
01:03:05.54 --> 01:03:07.14
And she's like, oh, I'm like, look at her.

866
01:03:07.14 --> 01:03:08.18
I'm like, oh, what's that like?

867
01:03:08.18 --> 01:03:09.14
It's a crazy thing.

868
01:03:09.14 --> 01:03:10.66
Yeah, or so clearly, we're all about to die.

869
01:03:10.66 --> 01:03:11.70
I'm going to X 15 seconds.

870
01:03:11.70 --> 01:03:12.98
Because we just made that noise.

871
01:03:12.98 --> 01:03:14.10
Exactly, right.

872
01:03:14.10 --> 01:03:16.02
And that's kind of what goes on for a split second.

873
01:03:16.02 --> 01:03:18.42
I wonder because I should have been able to

874
01:03:18.42 --> 01:03:19.62
deprogram myself.

875
01:03:19.62 --> 01:03:22.18
And I have a little, have a little bit, but it's not full.

876
01:03:22.18 --> 01:03:23.62
It's not a full deprogram when I hear it.

877
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:28.58
I still think imminent threat is within 14 seconds of impact.

878
01:03:28.58 --> 01:03:29.14
Yeah.

879
01:03:29.14 --> 01:03:30.58
And if not three seconds.

880
01:03:30.58 --> 01:03:32.74
Well, yeah, especially when it's out of nowhere like that.

881
01:03:32.74 --> 01:03:34.10
Oh, it's totally out of the list.

882
01:03:34.10 --> 01:03:34.98
You know, we're just driving.

883
01:03:34.98 --> 01:03:35.94
It's a sunny day, everything.

884
01:03:39.94 --> 01:03:40.98
So bad.

885
01:03:40.98 --> 01:03:42.90
Don't make that noise unless you're

886
01:03:42.90 --> 01:03:45.70
a, unless you see a person with a machete,

887
01:03:45.70 --> 01:03:47.54
and it's in the striking position,

888
01:03:47.54 --> 01:03:48.50
they'll make that noise.

889
01:03:48.50 --> 01:03:49.54
Because that's what I think.

890
01:03:49.54 --> 01:03:53.14
I think I think Freddy Krueger's with me

891
01:03:53.14 --> 01:03:54.34
with a, with a, with a, with a,

892
01:03:54.34 --> 01:03:56.74
battle axe getting ready to take my head off.

893
01:03:56.74 --> 01:03:59.30
Uh, no, I don't think he'd have a, a battle axe.

894
01:03:59.30 --> 01:04:00.74
No, he had them weird fingers.

895
01:04:00.74 --> 01:04:02.82
Yeah, yeah, the nice, some of the fingers.

896
01:04:02.82 --> 01:04:05.46
But yeah, dang, that's, yeah, good advice.

897
01:04:05.46 --> 01:04:08.82
100% you can't, I don't know how much you can train yourself

898
01:04:08.82 --> 01:04:09.54
with that though.

899
01:04:09.54 --> 01:04:10.34
That's no, no.

900
01:04:10.34 --> 01:04:13.86
And then, I think that's a, I think that's a genetic

901
01:04:13.86 --> 01:04:17.46
programmed noise that heightens the reaction.

902
01:04:17.46 --> 01:04:17.78
What?

903
01:04:17.78 --> 01:04:19.94
And prepares you for combat situations.

904
01:04:19.94 --> 01:04:22.02
Yeah, because there's like some reason it's more

905
01:04:22.02 --> 01:04:24.90
up into this thing where it can also be triggered

906
01:04:24.90 --> 01:04:30.10
to make that noise by a cute cat on the, you know, whatever.

907
01:04:30.10 --> 01:04:33.86
Yeah, or like, maybe she forgot something.

908
01:04:33.86 --> 01:04:35.62
You know, oh, yeah, that's another one.

909
01:04:35.62 --> 01:04:39.30
I forgot to tell you, like, you know, our friends

910
01:04:39.30 --> 01:04:41.86
are having a baby or something like this, you know?

911
01:04:41.86 --> 01:04:42.82
No, I want to be that.

912
01:04:42.82 --> 01:04:46.74
It'll be like, I forgot to tell you, I got Billy

913
01:04:46.74 --> 01:04:49.94
coming over for you to work on, you know, yard,

914
01:04:49.94 --> 01:04:51.38
yeah, sprinkler.

915
01:04:51.38 --> 01:04:52.26
Yeah, okay, cool.

916
01:04:52.26 --> 01:04:52.74
Thanks.

917
01:04:52.74 --> 01:04:54.90
Now that my adrenaline is through the real bad.

918
01:04:54.90 --> 01:04:55.54
That's gonna be out.

919
01:04:55.54 --> 01:04:56.74
Yeah.

920
01:04:56.74 --> 01:04:57.54
Yeah.

921
01:04:57.54 --> 01:05:00.02
Check.

922
01:05:00.02 --> 01:05:00.74
Back to the book.

923
01:05:00.74 --> 01:05:02.98
There's another kind of fear that must be endured

924
01:05:02.98 --> 01:05:06.74
for days and weeks, perhaps months or years.

925
01:05:06.74 --> 01:05:11.46
If men are besieged, cut off from help, deprived of inadequate

926
01:05:11.46 --> 01:05:14.58
deprived of adequate defense, then the ever present

927
01:05:14.58 --> 01:05:17.86
peril from the enemy may be aggravated by the greater

928
01:05:17.86 --> 01:05:20.42
peril of disease, famine, exposure.

929
01:05:21.54 --> 01:05:24.10
And there may be little chance for action.

930
01:05:24.90 --> 01:05:28.50
Men in the present war have endured primitive sorts of hardships

931
01:05:28.50 --> 01:05:32.74
that would seem to be beyond human endurance in baton,

932
01:05:32.74 --> 01:05:35.94
on correct or alone on a rubber life raft

933
01:05:35.94 --> 01:05:40.18
for five weeks and blistering sun and drenching storm

934
01:05:40.18 --> 01:05:43.70
without food, without shelter, without water, without any aid,

935
01:05:43.70 --> 01:05:48.58
but their own unquenchable spirit, their fortitude and their faith.

936
01:05:50.02 --> 01:05:52.34
This means terror mixed with despair.

937
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:54.98
The misery cannot be relieved.

938
01:05:54.98 --> 01:05:56.90
It can only be endured.

939
01:05:56.90 --> 01:06:00.74
Then they must maintain sanity, courage, and life itself

940
01:06:00.74 --> 01:06:05.38
by their ingenuity in originating occupations for hands and minds

941
01:06:05.38 --> 01:06:09.54
that we're relieved the tension and seem to reduce the hazards.

942
01:06:09.54 --> 01:06:12.82
And this is the kind of stuff that Captain Plum talked about.

943
01:06:12.82 --> 01:06:14.66
It's figuring out stuff to do.

944
01:06:14.66 --> 01:06:17.46
Like, just we're going to figure out stuff to do,

945
01:06:17.46 --> 01:06:19.06
whether it's...

946
01:06:19.06 --> 01:06:24.34
whether it's make teacher self-colligraphy by making an earwax

947
01:06:24.34 --> 01:06:30.90
a rich sketch or whatever.

948
01:06:30.90 --> 01:06:34.34
I mean, those guys figured out things to do.

949
01:06:34.34 --> 01:06:37.06
Back to the book and such trying times and intense moments,

950
01:06:37.06 --> 01:06:38.66
a laugh can be a lifesaver.

951
01:06:38.66 --> 01:06:41.22
An army officer relating experience of the World War,

952
01:06:41.22 --> 01:06:43.94
that's the first World War, tells of a time when badly frightened,

953
01:06:43.94 --> 01:06:47.46
untrained soldiers of that war had taken refuge in a roadside ditch

954
01:06:47.46 --> 01:06:51.78
against an unsfreshing horror, the fire of American guns

955
01:06:51.78 --> 01:06:53.62
turned on them by mistake.

956
01:06:53.62 --> 01:06:57.94
Pan-accent the blood pounding into my head and emptied my stomach of courage.

957
01:06:57.94 --> 01:07:00.66
It was bad enough to be shot at by the boge,

958
01:07:00.66 --> 01:07:04.58
but there was no sense in being killed by friendly troops.

959
01:07:04.58 --> 01:07:06.82
My men looked wild and fingered their triggers

960
01:07:06.82 --> 01:07:10.34
ready to return fire of our other battalion.

961
01:07:11.38 --> 01:07:13.38
Something had to be done and done quick,

962
01:07:13.38 --> 01:07:16.50
and Captain Wast did it unintentionally, but he still did it.

963
01:07:16.50 --> 01:07:20.50
Jackson, he yelled, yes, Captain, where are you?

964
01:07:20.50 --> 01:07:23.70
Right here, across the road, stand up so I can see you.

965
01:07:23.70 --> 01:07:28.26
Captain Jackson shouted above the crackling roar of machine gun bullets.

966
01:07:28.26 --> 01:07:32.02
If you want to see me, you stand up.

967
01:07:33.06 --> 01:07:35.30
American humor can lick anything.

968
01:07:35.30 --> 01:07:38.90
The smothered chuckles ran down the line, orders were given and listened to.

969
01:07:38.90 --> 01:07:41.70
Men wriggled backwards out of the zone of fire.

970
01:07:41.70 --> 01:07:44.66
The first to reach the trees dash down the line of third battalion,

971
01:07:44.66 --> 01:07:45.94
shutting off the guns.

972
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:48.90
So you're gonna hear jokes like that, and it is helpful.

973
01:07:51.06 --> 01:07:55.30
Continuing the soldier who deliberately chooses to be blown up in order to wipe out an

974
01:07:55.30 --> 01:07:59.46
enemy tank or machine gun nest that would have otherwise cost the lives of his friends

975
01:07:59.46 --> 01:08:03.70
as ideals, has indeed all it takes to make a soldier.

976
01:08:03.70 --> 01:08:08.26
The commander of a ship who coole sends away the last lifeboat and goes down with his vessel

977
01:08:08.26 --> 01:08:12.82
rather than abandon it while some of his men are helplessly imprisoned in one of its compartments

978
01:08:12.82 --> 01:08:17.22
is afraid, but governed by something more powerful than fear.

979
01:08:19.78 --> 01:08:22.02
That's a good statement, isn't it?

980
01:08:22.02 --> 01:08:25.22
Governance, do you have over your own emotions?

981
01:08:25.22 --> 01:08:39.38
You may call this force idealism, conscience, religion, philosophy, tradition, code, or even habit.

982
01:08:39.38 --> 01:08:43.14
Or you may be modern in call it ideology.

983
01:08:43.14 --> 01:08:48.50
Psychologists sometimes call it the triumph of the social over the selfish instincts.

984
01:08:48.50 --> 01:08:52.66
To recognize this force as the most potent weapon an army can possess,

985
01:08:52.66 --> 01:08:57.06
men fighting for their homes and armed with this spirit can stand their ground and win against

986
01:08:57.06 --> 01:08:58.90
tremendous opposing forces.

987
01:09:01.86 --> 01:09:06.74
Next section, why men fight lower animals fight from a variety of causes?

988
01:09:06.74 --> 01:09:11.78
Some fight because as be surprised, they live by killing and devouring animals may fight their

989
01:09:11.78 --> 01:09:14.34
own kind and a tossle over mate.

990
01:09:14.34 --> 01:09:17.94
They fight to defend their young, their homes, or their own lives.

991
01:09:17.94 --> 01:09:22.90
Some are aggressive and go about seeking what they may devour, others fight as a last resort

992
01:09:22.90 --> 01:09:24.42
when they are cornered.

993
01:09:24.42 --> 01:09:29.86
Men being too legant animals may fight for any or all of these reasons.

994
01:09:29.86 --> 01:09:35.06
But because they have minds capable of being moved by abstract ideas such as honor, glory,

995
01:09:35.06 --> 01:09:41.06
freedom, sympathy, justice, and patriotism, men also fight for what they believe to be right.

996
01:09:41.06 --> 01:09:47.62
Greater than a fear of injury and death, Napoleon said, is the fear of shame.

997
01:09:50.90 --> 01:09:56.50
Before a drafted man throws himself wholeheartedly into his work as a soldier before the civilian

998
01:09:56.50 --> 01:10:01.70
makes up his mind to enlist in the army, he is stirred by, he is stirred in influence by one or

999
01:10:01.70 --> 01:10:03.94
perhaps many of the following forces.

1000
01:10:05.14 --> 01:10:06.90
He may be carried away by men.

1001
01:10:06.90 --> 01:10:11.22
This is just laying out why people are in the army and this is important to understand if

1002
01:10:11.22 --> 01:10:14.42
you are a leader of a bunch of people in the army, then you have to understand how they ended

1003
01:10:14.42 --> 01:10:15.42
up there.

1004
01:10:15.42 --> 01:10:18.10
If you are in charge of a company, you have to understand how people ended up in a position

1005
01:10:18.10 --> 01:10:19.42
where they are working for you.

1006
01:10:19.42 --> 01:10:20.42
Why are they there?

1007
01:10:20.42 --> 01:10:22.70
How do they end up there?

1008
01:10:22.70 --> 01:10:25.26
He breaks it down for people that join the army.

1009
01:10:25.26 --> 01:10:31.30
One, he may be carried away by mass suggestion and infectious, martial spirit spreads through

1010
01:10:31.30 --> 01:10:35.62
the community, roused by government officials, speakers, writers, flags, or waving bands

1011
01:10:35.62 --> 01:10:37.62
or playing drums or beating and crowds of cheering.

1012
01:10:37.62 --> 01:10:44.66
Boom, to he may become involved in a wave of war and hysteria, like the furvernal of martial

1013
01:10:44.66 --> 01:10:50.74
spirit, war hate is infectious, men rush to arms at news of the enemy's evil designs or

1014
01:10:50.74 --> 01:10:55.14
brutality of a treacherous assault or intended invasion.

1015
01:10:55.14 --> 01:11:00.54
Three, he may be urged on by strong spirit of adventure.

1016
01:11:00.54 --> 01:11:05.98
For the ambitious self-centered man, especially perhaps if he has been unable to achieve

1017
01:11:05.98 --> 01:11:13.06
success in civilian life may see war as an opportunity to gain personal glory and power.

1018
01:11:13.06 --> 01:11:17.18
Five, he may be driven by his own combativeness.

1019
01:11:17.18 --> 01:11:22.10
Some men delight in fighting for its own sake, some may even be killers at heart, because

1020
01:11:22.10 --> 01:11:27.22
murder is outlawed in civilian life and because many circles even taking a poke in a man

1021
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:32.50
or cursing him freely is frowned upon, some combat of men may find their first thrill of

1022
01:11:32.50 --> 01:11:36.46
releasing an attack on the enemy.

1023
01:11:36.46 --> 01:11:42.50
Six, he may be unconsciously trying to relieve a grouch by violence that is considered

1024
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:43.70
legitimate.

1025
01:11:43.70 --> 01:11:47.50
The man who has spent a lifetime enduring unending series of disappointments, failures

1026
01:11:47.50 --> 01:11:53.50
and obstacles, and who has dammed up in himself, over-eVER mounting grievances and resentment

1027
01:11:53.50 --> 01:11:58.50
may be able to turn all that ill will against the enemy.

1028
01:11:58.50 --> 01:12:02.50
Seven, he may have joined the army as he would apply for a job.

1029
01:12:02.50 --> 01:12:06.86
Think about the stark difference between those couple there who got one person that just

1030
01:12:06.86 --> 01:12:09.94
wants to fight people or one person that feels like they've been a failure and everything

1031
01:12:09.94 --> 01:12:14.62
and just has an opportunity to take that grudge against the world.

1032
01:12:14.62 --> 01:12:17.50
I'm a murderer at heart and you got another guy that, hey I joined, because this is

1033
01:12:17.50 --> 01:12:18.50
okay.

1034
01:12:18.50 --> 01:12:19.50
Seems like a good job.

1035
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:21.50
They could pay me a GI bill or whatever.

1036
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.50
They're not there.

1037
01:12:23.50 --> 01:12:27.94
Hey, he may have been driven into army life by regard for public opinion.

1038
01:12:27.94 --> 01:12:34.34
He may feel keenly the way his friends, especially the girls, regard a military uniform

1039
01:12:34.34 --> 01:12:36.22
and a fighting man.

1040
01:12:36.22 --> 01:12:40.10
He may hate the thought of being considered a slacker.

1041
01:12:40.10 --> 01:12:45.70
Nine, it may be his desire to maintain his own self-esteem that moves him.

1042
01:12:45.70 --> 01:12:51.94
He may have to end his secret shame at the thought that others are doing the fighting

1043
01:12:51.94 --> 01:12:52.94
for him.

1044
01:12:52.94 --> 01:12:58.74
Ten, his action may be based on a feeling of oneness with the nation and on faith in the

1045
01:12:58.74 --> 01:13:00.74
leaders and the nation's leaders.

1046
01:13:00.74 --> 01:13:03.94
Eleven, he might be acting out of his faith in democracy.

1047
01:13:03.94 --> 01:13:08.50
Twelve, he might be compelled by his spirit of sacrifice.

1048
01:13:08.50 --> 01:13:13.10
All these reasons why men join the army, why they accept training in many cases, why

1049
01:13:13.10 --> 01:13:21.54
they keep on willingly, willingly when they go on overseas to a fighting front.

1050
01:13:21.54 --> 01:13:27.02
Yet by the motives, by then the motives usually change or some of them do and hear the

1051
01:13:27.02 --> 01:13:31.74
chief reasons why a man fights at the front.

1052
01:13:31.74 --> 01:13:32.90
So there's a little difference here.

1053
01:13:32.90 --> 01:13:34.86
So that's why they joined and now to why they're fighting.

1054
01:13:34.86 --> 01:13:36.22
And this is something to hear about.

1055
01:13:36.22 --> 01:13:38.86
It's kind of a cliche thing.

1056
01:13:38.86 --> 01:13:41.02
He's fighting for the guy who's left into his right.

1057
01:13:41.02 --> 01:13:43.06
This is this way we're going to go into a little bit.

1058
01:13:43.06 --> 01:13:45.30
Here's what it is and it's true.

1059
01:13:45.30 --> 01:13:48.94
13 in a unit with good morale he fights out of loyalty to his comrades and his unit.

1060
01:13:48.94 --> 01:13:51.18
Boom, there it is.

1061
01:13:51.18 --> 01:13:53.22
This is important though.

1062
01:13:53.22 --> 01:14:00.62
14 or he may fight because he is led to men at the front face danger and are often uncertain

1063
01:14:00.62 --> 01:14:02.06
what to do about it.

1064
01:14:02.06 --> 01:14:05.38
This is especially true in a unit with uncertain morale.

1065
01:14:05.38 --> 01:14:09.50
It's like I said earlier, like sometimes the leaders, if you got a good leader that's

1066
01:14:09.50 --> 01:14:13.02
going to make things happen, it's going to make things happen.

1067
01:14:13.02 --> 01:14:15.02
This is a good one.

1068
01:14:15.02 --> 01:14:16.02
15.

1069
01:14:16.02 --> 01:14:20.70
Finally a man may fight because there's literally nothing else to do.

1070
01:14:20.70 --> 01:14:23.62
And of course everyone uses the word literally now.

1071
01:14:23.62 --> 01:14:25.62
All the time.

1072
01:14:25.62 --> 01:14:32.50
And if you take it, if you remove that from your brain to make literally mean what

1073
01:14:32.50 --> 01:14:34.70
it's supposed to mean.

1074
01:14:34.70 --> 01:14:35.70
Think about the sentence.

1075
01:14:35.70 --> 01:14:40.50
Finally a man may fight because there is literally nothing else to do.

1076
01:14:40.50 --> 01:14:45.58
He and his comrades are in the war and at the front in battle.

1077
01:14:45.58 --> 01:14:49.94
No one stops to figure out why he should escape from a burning house.

1078
01:14:49.94 --> 01:14:51.42
So with fighting.

1079
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:54.18
So yeah, there's some people like, oh yeah, guess what?

1080
01:14:54.18 --> 01:14:56.58
You have two choices.

1081
01:14:56.58 --> 01:14:58.22
Fight or die.

1082
01:14:58.22 --> 01:15:01.78
And you're going to fight.

1083
01:15:01.78 --> 01:15:05.02
How man meet defeat?

1084
01:15:05.02 --> 01:15:10.06
The way a man stands up to a blow partly of course depends on how heavy the blow.

1085
01:15:10.06 --> 01:15:14.50
And a man is faced with a very difficult problem or a series of them with any sort of obstacle

1086
01:15:14.50 --> 01:15:17.02
or frustration when things become too difficult.

1087
01:15:17.02 --> 01:15:18.58
There are three sorts of things he can do.

1088
01:15:18.58 --> 01:15:23.34
He can work at it harder attacking the problem from new angles with increasing vigor.

1089
01:15:23.34 --> 01:15:27.86
He can get mad and attempt to destroy the obstacle or himself or something else.

1090
01:15:27.86 --> 01:15:33.42
And three, he can give up and despair and run away in apathy.

1091
01:15:33.42 --> 01:15:35.82
The first way is the way of learning.

1092
01:15:35.82 --> 01:15:36.82
Right?

1093
01:15:36.82 --> 01:15:38.94
When what seems like a good plan is hit upon and it is tried.

1094
01:15:38.94 --> 01:15:44.22
If this fails, there's a signal for more thinking when a good working plan is finally

1095
01:15:44.22 --> 01:15:45.62
evolved.

1096
01:15:45.62 --> 01:15:47.86
Success is achieved and the man is learned.

1097
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:49.46
So that's the best thing to do.

1098
01:15:49.46 --> 01:15:53.34
You try different solutions.

1099
01:15:53.34 --> 01:15:55.54
All this activity is healthy and less the individual.

1100
01:15:55.54 --> 01:15:56.82
Oh, there's a little balance.

1101
01:15:56.82 --> 01:15:58.26
There's a little dichotomy here.

1102
01:15:58.26 --> 01:16:00.62
All this activity is healthy.

1103
01:16:00.62 --> 01:16:05.90
Unless the individual becomes so engrossed with a single problem, so obsessed by it that

1104
01:16:05.90 --> 01:16:10.66
he fails to eat or sleep or pay attention to other necessary problems.

1105
01:16:10.66 --> 01:16:14.90
Get a target fixation.

1106
01:16:14.90 --> 01:16:20.42
Getting mad over disappointments or failures is generally not profitable.

1107
01:16:20.42 --> 01:16:26.26
It's particularly hard on the innocent bystander because of the way men have of shifting

1108
01:16:26.26 --> 01:16:31.02
their grouch from the original obstacle to other persons or things.

1109
01:16:31.02 --> 01:16:36.22
The man who fails to get a promotion, he has been working and longing for doesn't take

1110
01:16:36.22 --> 01:16:39.58
a poke at the officer who refused to recommend him.

1111
01:16:39.58 --> 01:16:43.70
Much as he would like to have it out with him and said he's likely to kick his buddy in

1112
01:16:43.70 --> 01:16:45.42
the pants so much as he raises.

1113
01:16:45.42 --> 01:16:52.46
If he's so much as raised as an eyebrow, leaders too may take it out on a funding man who

1114
01:16:52.46 --> 01:16:57.70
then wonder what's eaten him.

1115
01:16:57.70 --> 01:17:02.58
Aggression may also be turned inward onto the self.

1116
01:17:02.58 --> 01:17:07.94
Many a man goes about kicking himself, usually figuratively, but sometimes in real self

1117
01:17:07.94 --> 01:17:12.02
punishments such as banging the head or punching or kicking a hard object until the flesh

1118
01:17:12.02 --> 01:17:14.34
is bruised.

1119
01:17:14.34 --> 01:17:20.26
Of course the extreme of self punishment for disastrous failure or frustration is suicide,

1120
01:17:20.26 --> 01:17:25.46
but mostly suicide is just giving up.

1121
01:17:25.46 --> 01:17:28.14
That first you don't succeed try try again.

1122
01:17:28.14 --> 01:17:34.74
This adage may be used to maintain courage, but the process is actually governed by natural

1123
01:17:34.74 --> 01:17:36.58
law.

1124
01:17:36.58 --> 01:17:42.06
The number of times a man will attempt to accomplish a certain job or to reach a certain objective

1125
01:17:42.06 --> 01:17:46.82
is governed in one direction by the importance of that particular success and in the other

1126
01:17:46.82 --> 01:17:51.14
direction by the effort and pain involved in trying.

1127
01:17:51.14 --> 01:17:57.86
And the successful achievement means less than the individual than the freedom from the strain

1128
01:17:57.86 --> 01:18:02.26
of trying to attain it, any man will abandon the struggle.

1129
01:18:02.26 --> 01:18:08.86
Giving up is nature's way of protecting the organism against too much pain.

1130
01:18:08.86 --> 01:18:11.70
So that's my...

1131
01:18:11.70 --> 01:18:13.86
Don't...

1132
01:18:13.86 --> 01:18:18.30
Once you've banged your head against the wall 44 times, that's enough.

1133
01:18:18.30 --> 01:18:22.34
That you're not going to get through it on the 45th or the 46th or the 47th try.

1134
01:18:22.34 --> 01:18:26.66
You need to find a different way.

1135
01:18:26.66 --> 01:18:28.70
That goes on.

1136
01:18:28.70 --> 01:18:36.22
Giving up may mean defeat, but it does not always mean surrender.

1137
01:18:36.22 --> 01:18:41.82
In most situation what is given up is some particular way of reaching the goal rather than

1138
01:18:41.82 --> 01:18:45.70
a complete abandonment of the objective.

1139
01:18:45.70 --> 01:18:50.50
It's sort of defeat results in thinking and fresh striving in eventual progress.

1140
01:18:50.50 --> 01:18:54.30
A man who has been unable to get a commission in the army may enlist earn his stripes

1141
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:58.62
and later reach an officer candidate school.

1142
01:18:58.62 --> 01:19:01.34
Another kind of giving up results in compromise.

1143
01:19:01.34 --> 01:19:07.06
The original objective is abandon, but another more easily achieved is substituted.

1144
01:19:07.06 --> 01:19:08.30
And this stuff is...

1145
01:19:08.30 --> 01:19:14.14
This is the things that people get the impression that...

1146
01:19:14.14 --> 01:19:15.14
Well, from me.

1147
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:17.18
Well, you just never give up.

1148
01:19:17.18 --> 01:19:19.18
Like, never compromise.

1149
01:19:19.18 --> 01:19:21.18
It sounds really cool to say that.

1150
01:19:21.18 --> 01:19:22.18
Yeah.

1151
01:19:22.18 --> 01:19:23.18
There was no...

1152
01:19:23.18 --> 01:19:25.18
There was no t-shirt back in the day.

1153
01:19:25.18 --> 01:19:26.18
Sure.

1154
01:19:26.18 --> 01:19:29.22
It was for H&K rifles.

1155
01:19:29.22 --> 01:19:30.22
Yeah.

1156
01:19:30.22 --> 01:19:34.82
And it said in a world of compromise, some don't.

1157
01:19:34.82 --> 01:19:39.02
And had a picture of an entry team going into a building.

1158
01:19:39.02 --> 01:19:43.86
And of course, you hear that and you think that's right.

1159
01:19:43.86 --> 01:19:46.46
So, you don't compromise ever.

1160
01:19:46.46 --> 01:19:48.70
But here's the problem.

1161
01:19:48.70 --> 01:19:55.54
No compromise means if you don't win every single time, you will get defeated and destroyed.

1162
01:19:55.54 --> 01:19:56.54
Because you're not going to win.

1163
01:19:56.54 --> 01:19:58.54
And the problem is that is you're not going to win every time.

1164
01:19:58.54 --> 01:20:00.14
You're not going to win every argument that you have.

1165
01:20:00.14 --> 01:20:03.22
You're not going to win every idea that you put forth isn't going to be the idea that

1166
01:20:03.22 --> 01:20:05.06
could select it.

1167
01:20:05.06 --> 01:20:09.22
And what you end up being is a person that can't work with anyone else.

1168
01:20:09.22 --> 01:20:15.30
Or you end up a person that has one chance at charging a machine gun nest and you go straight

1169
01:20:15.30 --> 01:20:18.38
forward up the hill towards the machine gun nest and guess what, everyone dies.

1170
01:20:18.38 --> 01:20:19.38
Yeah.

1171
01:20:19.38 --> 01:20:23.82
You didn't achieve the mission and everyone is dead.

1172
01:20:23.82 --> 01:20:26.22
Now if you would have said, you know what, we tried.

1173
01:20:26.22 --> 01:20:27.22
We lost two guys.

1174
01:20:27.22 --> 01:20:31.86
We backed up, now we're in covered position and we're waiting for some reinforcements.

1175
01:20:31.86 --> 01:20:34.22
And when the reinforcements show up, here's the plan.

1176
01:20:34.22 --> 01:20:35.50
We're going to put down covering fire.

1177
01:20:35.50 --> 01:20:38.18
We're going to maneuver around the flank or we're going to get a heavy weapon in here

1178
01:20:38.18 --> 01:20:40.18
and we're going to shoot a bazooka at this thing.

1179
01:20:40.18 --> 01:20:41.18
Whatever.

1180
01:20:41.18 --> 01:20:46.22
So this one is in the book where it says, give up.

1181
01:20:46.22 --> 01:20:47.86
It's not giving up.

1182
01:20:47.86 --> 01:20:49.86
It's more like giving up on a certain thing.

1183
01:20:49.86 --> 01:20:53.86
He says giving up does not always mean surrender.

1184
01:20:53.86 --> 01:20:56.06
So surrender is like I give up on the mission.

1185
01:20:56.06 --> 01:20:57.06
Yes.

1186
01:20:57.06 --> 01:20:58.06
Essentially.

1187
01:20:58.06 --> 01:20:59.06
Giving up is like giving up.

1188
01:20:59.06 --> 01:21:04.06
Like just basically stop doing something that's not working kind of thing.

1189
01:21:04.06 --> 01:21:05.06
Right.

1190
01:21:05.06 --> 01:21:06.06
Yeah.

1191
01:21:06.06 --> 01:21:08.82
So the question on the podcast is when is it okay to quit?

1192
01:21:08.82 --> 01:21:09.82
Yes.

1193
01:21:09.82 --> 01:21:10.82
Define this exact thing.

1194
01:21:10.82 --> 01:21:11.82
Yeah.

1195
01:21:11.82 --> 01:21:12.82
The definition.

1196
01:21:12.82 --> 01:21:13.82
That's kind of the thing.

1197
01:21:13.82 --> 01:21:18.82
And I had the conversation with a guy that we both know who was making a great effort

1198
01:21:18.82 --> 01:21:19.94
in a business.

1199
01:21:19.94 --> 01:21:25.02
The business was not being successful the way he had envisioned it.

1200
01:21:25.02 --> 01:21:26.82
And it was costing him a lot of money.

1201
01:21:26.82 --> 01:21:27.82
It was costing him time.

1202
01:21:27.82 --> 01:21:30.38
He was putting all the efforts into it.

1203
01:21:30.38 --> 01:21:41.38
And he literally asked me, hey man, if I shift to something else, is that quitting?

1204
01:21:41.38 --> 01:21:46.78
And I said, it's quitting, but it's not surrendering.

1205
01:21:46.78 --> 01:21:50.14
And I actually said, what is your goal?

1206
01:21:50.14 --> 01:21:53.10
And his goal was not to be successful in that particular business.

1207
01:21:53.10 --> 01:21:58.82
His goal was to spend time with his family and set up a safe financial situation for them.

1208
01:21:58.82 --> 01:22:05.82
And he kind of got his wires crossed on thinking that this business that he had started

1209
01:22:05.82 --> 01:22:07.14
was the mission.

1210
01:22:07.14 --> 01:22:09.14
It wasn't the mission.

1211
01:22:09.14 --> 01:22:12.82
The mission was taking care of his family and spending time with his family.

1212
01:22:12.82 --> 01:22:15.86
And he was actually failing to do either.

1213
01:22:15.86 --> 01:22:21.14
So sometimes you have to, sometimes you have to make those adjustments.

1214
01:22:21.14 --> 01:22:22.14
You have to quit.

1215
01:22:22.14 --> 01:22:25.82
You just because you quit one plan doesn't mean you surrender.

1216
01:22:25.82 --> 01:22:26.82
Yeah.

1217
01:22:26.82 --> 01:22:30.98
In fact, I would get mad at young seals when they would come up with a plan.

1218
01:22:30.98 --> 01:22:34.62
They'd use the plan to go hit a training target.

1219
01:22:34.62 --> 01:22:37.18
The plan would start to fail and they wouldn't adapt.

1220
01:22:37.18 --> 01:22:38.18
They wouldn't change.

1221
01:22:38.18 --> 01:22:39.18
They'd stick with the plan.

1222
01:22:39.18 --> 01:22:40.18
I'm not a quitter.

1223
01:22:40.18 --> 01:22:42.18
We're going to keep going.

1224
01:22:42.18 --> 01:22:43.18
Well, really, okay.

1225
01:22:43.18 --> 01:22:44.18
Cool.

1226
01:22:44.18 --> 01:22:45.18
We'll kill everyone that you have.

1227
01:22:45.18 --> 01:22:46.42
You can do buddy carries the rest of the night out here in the desert.

1228
01:22:46.42 --> 01:22:47.58
I got all my.

1229
01:22:47.58 --> 01:22:54.02
So it's essentially, when it comes down to it's almost like an issue with the language.

1230
01:22:54.02 --> 01:22:59.26
Because like quitting, giving up like these are things that were kind of trained to think

1231
01:22:59.26 --> 01:23:00.26
are bad.

1232
01:23:00.26 --> 01:23:02.06
These are bad things to quit and give up.

1233
01:23:02.06 --> 01:23:06.70
So all you have, I mean, and given what he's talking, you know, like nowadays, I've heard

1234
01:23:06.70 --> 01:23:08.42
people use word pivot.

1235
01:23:08.42 --> 01:23:10.10
Like the guy we're talking about with business, right?

1236
01:23:10.10 --> 01:23:11.10
I've got pivot.

1237
01:23:11.10 --> 01:23:12.10
Yeah, I got pivot.

1238
01:23:12.10 --> 01:23:14.10
It's like, well, pivot, pivot, give up.

1239
01:23:14.10 --> 01:23:19.58
I mean, I'd rather use word pivot because it sounds like, hey, I'm still on the mission

1240
01:23:19.58 --> 01:23:20.58
on the path.

1241
01:23:20.58 --> 01:23:21.58
I'm just taking a different direction.

1242
01:23:21.58 --> 01:23:27.46
You know, it would we'd have to come up with a legitimate what never quit, which is what

1243
01:23:27.46 --> 01:23:30.58
we're actually taught in the sealed teams.

1244
01:23:30.58 --> 01:23:33.18
But then when you say you're never quit, that means never surrender.

1245
01:23:33.18 --> 01:23:34.18
That's what that.

1246
01:23:34.18 --> 01:23:40.26
That's what it really means is never lose sight of accomplishing and doing what it takes

1247
01:23:40.26 --> 01:23:43.22
to accomplish your long term strategic goals.

1248
01:23:43.22 --> 01:23:44.22
That's what it really means.

1249
01:23:44.22 --> 01:23:46.10
But that doesn't sound as cool as never quit.

1250
01:23:46.10 --> 01:23:47.10
Yeah.

1251
01:23:47.10 --> 01:23:49.10
But then, and then give up same thing.

1252
01:23:49.10 --> 01:23:54.34
Give up means like, this is too much for me or I'm not willing to work it hard through

1253
01:23:54.34 --> 01:23:55.34
it or whatever.

1254
01:23:55.34 --> 01:23:56.34
That's what it feels like.

1255
01:23:56.34 --> 01:23:57.74
It means, but in this book, it doesn't mean that.

1256
01:23:57.74 --> 01:24:02.02
I mean, here's a little, little dichotomy for me that kind of hurts it.

1257
01:24:02.02 --> 01:24:03.98
I know I think it's pretty much ego talking.

1258
01:24:03.98 --> 01:24:07.94
But I, when I hear pivot, I risk their golf.

1259
01:24:07.94 --> 01:24:08.94
They're going so well.

1260
01:24:08.94 --> 01:24:10.34
I think they're giving up on that.

1261
01:24:10.34 --> 01:24:11.34
They're going to do it.

1262
01:24:11.34 --> 01:24:12.34
And you know what that's like?

1263
01:24:12.34 --> 01:24:14.18
That's having negative connotation, which is, which is not good.

1264
01:24:14.18 --> 01:24:18.70
I'm criticizing myself for even having those shots because you do have to pivot in

1265
01:24:18.70 --> 01:24:19.70
business.

1266
01:24:19.70 --> 01:24:20.98
You do have to pivot in combat.

1267
01:24:20.98 --> 01:24:24.38
You can't be like, oh, here's what we were trying to do and it wasn't working.

1268
01:24:24.38 --> 01:24:25.94
So we're just going to do it harder.

1269
01:24:25.94 --> 01:24:29.38
No, you actually have to say, hey, this isn't working and we're going to make some adjustments.

1270
01:24:29.38 --> 01:24:30.38
We're going to pivot.

1271
01:24:30.38 --> 01:24:31.38
Yeah.

1272
01:24:31.38 --> 01:24:35.82
And I think that's what that word was sort of introduced to that whole space to mean.

1273
01:24:35.82 --> 01:24:37.30
Because of all these different.

1274
01:24:37.30 --> 01:24:41.46
But then here's the thing, though, on the flip side, that some guys don't give up.

1275
01:24:41.46 --> 01:24:44.70
They'll straight up give up because it's too much work and be like, I'm going to take a new

1276
01:24:44.70 --> 01:24:45.70
direction in a life.

1277
01:24:45.70 --> 01:24:52.70
You know, I'm going to pivot towards more of the personal stuff, more personal things.

1278
01:24:52.70 --> 01:24:54.70
Yeah, I'm going to move this one.

1279
01:24:54.70 --> 01:24:56.46
Meanwhile, they surrendered their whole mission.

1280
01:24:56.46 --> 01:24:57.46
Those too much work.

1281
01:24:57.46 --> 01:24:58.46
Right.

1282
01:24:58.46 --> 01:25:00.82
You know, we're like, it didn't come as easier quickly or what it is.

1283
01:25:00.82 --> 01:25:04.66
We're going to pivot or pivot hard if we need to.

1284
01:25:04.66 --> 01:25:05.66
Yes.

1285
01:25:05.66 --> 01:25:06.66
Check.

1286
01:25:06.66 --> 01:25:13.86
Next, ability to accept defeat in such ways is no fault of character.

1287
01:25:13.86 --> 01:25:19.06
In fact, a man who can take it and still do his best without bitterness is highly regarded

1288
01:25:19.06 --> 01:25:22.70
in the army and in civilian life.

1289
01:25:22.70 --> 01:25:27.70
But there are other ways of meeting defeat or disappointment that are destructive and

1290
01:25:27.70 --> 01:25:31.22
may result in psychological casualty.

1291
01:25:31.22 --> 01:25:36.78
The familiar sour grapes reaction is what happens in a man who has set his heart so firmly

1292
01:25:36.78 --> 01:25:40.90
on a particular achievement that he can't give it up and face the fact.

1293
01:25:40.90 --> 01:25:46.10
So he belittles or runs down the very job he wants so much to have.

1294
01:25:46.10 --> 01:25:52.34
He says pilots are all crazy or fools and the whole flying game is a jip.

1295
01:25:52.34 --> 01:25:53.34
You.

1296
01:25:53.34 --> 01:25:56.62
We have to talk to good deal Dave Burke about that one.

1297
01:25:56.62 --> 01:25:59.22
No, because that definitely happens.

1298
01:25:59.22 --> 01:26:01.30
You know, you get someone that's trying to achieve.

1299
01:26:01.30 --> 01:26:02.82
You're going to care about a black belt.

1300
01:26:02.82 --> 01:26:03.82
Yeah.

1301
01:26:03.82 --> 01:26:04.82
It's not even that big with deal.

1302
01:26:04.82 --> 01:26:05.82
Yeah.

1303
01:26:05.82 --> 01:26:06.82
Cool.

1304
01:26:06.82 --> 01:26:07.82
Don't get one.

1305
01:26:07.82 --> 01:26:08.82
Because apparently you're not sour grapes.

1306
01:26:08.82 --> 01:26:11.34
You know where that expression comes from?

1307
01:26:11.34 --> 01:26:12.34
I do not.

1308
01:26:12.34 --> 01:26:13.34
Yeah.

1309
01:26:13.34 --> 01:26:14.34
So I didn't either.

1310
01:26:14.34 --> 01:26:15.86
No, until I was willing to adulthood.

1311
01:26:15.86 --> 01:26:17.98
So it's like a old, what do you call them?

1312
01:26:17.98 --> 01:26:18.98
Little fable.

1313
01:26:18.98 --> 01:26:19.98
I don't know.

1314
01:26:19.98 --> 01:26:20.98
I don't know.

1315
01:26:20.98 --> 01:26:22.78
What is it when it's like a story that didn't really happen.

1316
01:26:22.78 --> 01:26:24.98
But it was a so all the favor.

1317
01:26:24.98 --> 01:26:25.98
Super short.

1318
01:26:25.98 --> 01:26:27.66
So this fox.

1319
01:26:27.66 --> 01:26:33.22
It was hungry and saw some grapes up on the vines, right?

1320
01:26:33.22 --> 01:26:34.70
And so the fox is like dang, that's pretty high.

1321
01:26:34.70 --> 01:26:35.70
So it's all good.

1322
01:26:35.70 --> 01:26:36.70
I'm going to jump up on me.

1323
01:26:36.70 --> 01:26:37.70
Eat those grapes.

1324
01:26:37.70 --> 01:26:39.70
Okay.

1325
01:26:39.70 --> 01:26:40.70
Jump up.

1326
01:26:40.70 --> 01:26:41.70
Mises the grape.

1327
01:26:41.70 --> 01:26:42.70
He can't jump high enough.

1328
01:26:42.70 --> 01:26:43.70
So he's like, all right.

1329
01:26:43.70 --> 01:26:46.70
He comes back and he's like, you know, I just got to jump higher.

1330
01:26:46.70 --> 01:26:47.70
That's all.

1331
01:26:47.70 --> 01:26:48.70
So he jumps hot.

1332
01:26:48.70 --> 01:26:49.70
Even higher still can't.

1333
01:26:49.70 --> 01:26:50.70
Still can't.

1334
01:26:50.70 --> 01:26:51.70
Try as again.

1335
01:26:51.70 --> 01:26:52.70
Still can't get him.

1336
01:26:52.70 --> 01:26:53.70
Again, still can't get him.

1337
01:26:53.70 --> 01:26:55.70
Finally gives up.

1338
01:26:55.70 --> 01:26:56.70
Doesn't pivot.

1339
01:26:56.70 --> 01:26:57.70
Gives up.

1340
01:26:57.70 --> 01:26:59.70
And while he's leaving, he says.

1341
01:26:59.70 --> 01:27:02.70
Scrapes were probably sour anyway.

1342
01:27:02.70 --> 01:27:03.70
There it is.

1343
01:27:03.70 --> 01:27:05.70
There you go.

1344
01:27:05.70 --> 01:27:09.70
Don't like that.

1345
01:27:09.70 --> 01:27:10.70
Continuing.

1346
01:27:10.70 --> 01:27:17.50
More likely to occur is a sort of symbolic running away through fainting illness or physical

1347
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:18.50
defect.

1348
01:27:18.50 --> 01:27:24.30
Defect a man faced with failure to pass an examination for a promotion or he is long

1349
01:27:24.30 --> 01:27:28.50
for may suddenly a nouncyty is colorblind or nightblind or has some other previously

1350
01:27:28.50 --> 01:27:31.90
undiscovered defect that would prevent a success.

1351
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:36.10
And then the story may become actually ill and be honestly unaware of the connection between

1352
01:27:36.10 --> 01:27:38.50
sudden sickness and frustration.

1353
01:27:38.50 --> 01:27:46.70
This is a fainting physical defect is a big one for people that don't make it through

1354
01:27:46.70 --> 01:27:49.10
some kind of military training program.

1355
01:27:49.10 --> 01:27:50.10
So what is that?

1356
01:27:50.10 --> 01:27:51.90
That's like we're like, what happened?

1357
01:27:51.90 --> 01:27:53.90
I remember my like, right.

1358
01:27:53.90 --> 01:27:59.30
Maybe they did it or we are so are they blaming something that actually is occurring

1359
01:27:59.30 --> 01:28:01.50
or are they just sort of making it physical effect?

1360
01:28:01.50 --> 01:28:03.50
I couldn't do this because my life was hurt.

1361
01:28:03.50 --> 01:28:06.70
That's why I didn't make it through the program because I got this.

1362
01:28:06.70 --> 01:28:07.70
I got that.

1363
01:28:07.70 --> 01:28:08.70
Okay.

1364
01:28:08.70 --> 01:28:14.70
And the other thing they make is sometimes people actually get sick but it's because they're

1365
01:28:14.70 --> 01:28:17.50
you know, the mind body connection.

1366
01:28:17.50 --> 01:28:21.70
It's crazy.

1367
01:28:21.70 --> 01:28:22.70
Back to the book.

1368
01:28:22.70 --> 01:28:26.10
Each man no matter how strong mentally and physically has his limits beyond which the

1369
01:28:26.10 --> 01:28:29.70
strongest will cannot drive him.

1370
01:28:29.70 --> 01:28:34.98
The wise man learns his own tolerances and cautiously retreats if possible to a more

1371
01:28:34.98 --> 01:28:44.02
defended position when hazards and obstacles he is in danger of are too great.

1372
01:28:44.02 --> 01:28:48.10
It's amazing that they so clearly understood this.

1373
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:50.78
This is 1942 or something like that.

1374
01:28:50.78 --> 01:28:53.74
And they're saying look, they're saying the exact same thing that's a big revelation

1375
01:28:53.74 --> 01:28:54.74
to say, pivot.

1376
01:28:54.74 --> 01:28:56.74
They're saying the same thing.

1377
01:28:56.74 --> 01:29:02.74
Rage, a two-edged weapon.

1378
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:06.82
A group of tanks stands in a field silent motionless and dead.

1379
01:29:06.82 --> 01:29:09.66
Suddenly switches on from a motor start and they become alive.

1380
01:29:09.66 --> 01:29:12.94
Noise bursts from their exhaust and they roar to attack.

1381
01:29:12.94 --> 01:29:17.42
A gun is a nerd and dead until a high explosive powder is set off in its chambers.

1382
01:29:17.42 --> 01:29:20.62
A bomb without nitroglycerin is a dud.

1383
01:29:20.62 --> 01:29:25.06
All weapons are mere useless pieces of metal until the release of energy brings them

1384
01:29:25.06 --> 01:29:26.06
to life.

1385
01:29:26.06 --> 01:29:35.66
Man, two, as a weapon of war must have energy released to galvanize him into acting, fighting

1386
01:29:35.66 --> 01:29:38.18
soldier.

1387
01:29:38.18 --> 01:29:45.18
And the high explosive that sets off a man's fighting power is emotion.

1388
01:29:45.18 --> 01:29:49.70
There are certain things that a man can do in an automatic way without the fire of emotional

1389
01:29:49.70 --> 01:29:50.70
energy.

1390
01:29:50.70 --> 01:29:55.54
These things would win no wars without fear and without rage.

1391
01:29:55.54 --> 01:30:00.14
You could not even defend himself of the enemy or aiming at him and about to fire.

1392
01:30:00.14 --> 01:30:05.38
Slap a man's face and he will become in rage, drop a bomb beside him and he may become

1393
01:30:05.38 --> 01:30:07.62
terrified.

1394
01:30:07.62 --> 01:30:15.26
But although the two feelings may seem different to the man very different, inwardly,

1395
01:30:15.26 --> 01:30:18.42
the change that take place in his body or similar.

1396
01:30:18.42 --> 01:30:23.06
His heart beats faster, his blood pressure rises, his blood is shifted from internal organs

1397
01:30:23.06 --> 01:30:28.74
to the muscles, his digestion stop, stops, sugar in his blood increases, his hands tremble,

1398
01:30:28.74 --> 01:30:34.14
his voice quivers, the body wists in the bladder or bowels may be expelled, he becomes

1399
01:30:34.14 --> 01:30:36.98
alert and ready for instant action.

1400
01:30:36.98 --> 01:30:41.62
Whether all this extreme preparation for action by the body is a good thing for the soldier

1401
01:30:41.62 --> 01:30:46.42
or whether it will eventually or whether it will actually endanger his life depends on

1402
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:48.14
the circumstances.

1403
01:30:48.14 --> 01:30:54.66
And in primitive hand to hand combat when the last ounce of energy of which the body is capable

1404
01:30:54.66 --> 01:31:01.42
must be summoned instantly for one tremendous spur of running to get away from peril or

1405
01:31:01.42 --> 01:31:07.62
for one outburst of physical strength to down the foe, rage or fear will pour into blood

1406
01:31:07.62 --> 01:31:13.34
the adrenaline necessary to rouse that vital energy.

1407
01:31:13.34 --> 01:31:19.34
If the immediate vigorous action is impossible, however, and if life depends instead upon

1408
01:31:19.34 --> 01:31:26.38
the cool headed use of skill, self-control and discipline, then violent emotion can put

1409
01:31:26.38 --> 01:31:31.34
the soldier in mortal peril.

1410
01:31:31.34 --> 01:31:37.34
So this one thing can kill you or save you.

1411
01:31:37.34 --> 01:31:41.82
Yeah, it's an interesting differentiation there where it's like, hey, if the task kind of

1412
01:31:41.82 --> 01:31:45.34
requires skill and stuff, you've got to control that.

1413
01:31:45.34 --> 01:31:49.54
You can't be doing it, but if it's like, hey, if you sometimes, because it's face it

1414
01:31:49.54 --> 01:31:54.50
in life and whatever, sometimes it just, you just got to power through some stuff.

1415
01:31:54.50 --> 01:31:55.50
Everyone's doing well.

1416
01:31:55.50 --> 01:31:56.50
Yeah, no doubt about it.

1417
01:31:56.50 --> 01:32:02.10
And actually, you said, how put quite eloquently?

1418
01:32:02.10 --> 01:32:06.26
Sometimes you have to use your logic and sometimes you have to use your logic and sometimes

1419
01:32:06.26 --> 01:32:10.10
you have to use your logic and then you have to use your logic and then you have to use

1420
01:32:10.10 --> 01:32:11.94
it in the field manual.

1421
01:32:11.94 --> 01:32:15.82
Sometimes, if your logic fails, like, if you can't think of a good reason why I

1422
01:32:15.82 --> 01:32:19.48
should I do another set or why should I go competing this thing?

1423
01:32:19.48 --> 01:32:22.46
You have to let your emotions get a little get in the game.

1424
01:32:22.46 --> 01:32:26.10
And then sometimes your emotions get shut down.

1425
01:32:26.10 --> 01:32:27.10
Yeah.

1426
01:32:27.10 --> 01:32:28.02
Because the goods are just stupid.

1427
01:32:28.02 --> 01:32:29.02
Doesn't make sense.

1428
01:32:29.02 --> 01:32:30.02
Yeah.

1429
01:32:30.02 --> 01:32:31.02
Yeah.

1430
01:32:31.02 --> 01:32:32.54
Well, then you got to let your emotions go.

1431
01:32:32.54 --> 01:32:33.54
Wait, me, it doesn't make sense.

1432
01:32:33.54 --> 01:32:35.14
Because you're being weak.

1433
01:32:35.14 --> 01:32:37.02
You don't like that.

1434
01:32:37.02 --> 01:32:38.02
It's bad.

1435
01:32:38.02 --> 01:32:43.02
Logic one, a lot of times is, well, it's more dynamic, I'd say,

1436
01:32:43.90 --> 01:32:46.14
because you can have full cut-wall on it,

1437
01:32:46.14 --> 01:32:49.06
but I can have full conversations in my head.

1438
01:32:49.06 --> 01:32:50.50
And the work you're not one was a big one,

1439
01:32:50.50 --> 01:32:53.10
where I'm like, think about how you'll feel after.

1440
01:32:53.10 --> 01:32:55.06
That's gonna be the benefit, you know?

1441
01:32:55.06 --> 01:32:56.26
But then at the same time, I would be like,

1442
01:32:56.26 --> 01:32:58.06
hey, wait, but you could easily rest right now.

1443
01:32:58.06 --> 01:32:59.78
You can get recut, you know, so it's like,

1444
01:32:59.78 --> 01:33:03.34
you're one of those guys, it has a huge, huge,

1445
01:33:03.34 --> 01:33:06.46
surplus of standing by things that are like, look,

1446
01:33:06.46 --> 01:33:09.06
you know, the most important part of working out is,

1447
01:33:09.06 --> 01:33:13.46
as a representative, you don't grow.

1448
01:33:13.46 --> 01:33:15.34
You don't get stronger when you're working out.

1449
01:33:15.34 --> 01:33:17.38
You actually get stronger when you rest.

1450
01:33:17.38 --> 01:33:18.18
Yep, when you rest.

1451
01:33:18.18 --> 01:33:19.02
Sure.

1452
01:33:19.02 --> 01:33:20.26
You got that little voice, so you get that,

1453
01:33:20.26 --> 01:33:22.66
that one little monkey on your shoulder,

1454
01:33:22.66 --> 01:33:24.14
that's whispered in those things.

1455
01:33:24.14 --> 01:33:26.62
Yeah, but now I got you who, in like,

1456
01:33:26.62 --> 01:33:27.46
the big monkey.

1457
01:33:27.46 --> 01:33:30.06
Yeah, even bigger one, because,

1458
01:33:30.06 --> 01:33:32.18
and I got this from you, essentially, where it's like,

1459
01:33:32.18 --> 01:33:35.86
okay, I can, this is kind of the conversations

1460
01:33:35.86 --> 01:33:39.34
went on my head, typically.

1461
01:33:39.34 --> 01:33:41.22
So yes, I can be like, yeah, the recovery,

1462
01:33:41.22 --> 01:33:44.62
that's how you, you know, get the gains, whatever,

1463
01:33:44.62 --> 01:33:46.46
that's on one side, then the other side is like,

1464
01:33:46.46 --> 01:33:49.42
wait, but you want to train a whole,

1465
01:33:49.42 --> 01:33:51.22
there's way more to working out

1466
01:33:51.22 --> 01:33:53.58
than just getting bigger and stronger.

1467
01:33:53.58 --> 01:33:54.66
There's more to it.

1468
01:33:54.66 --> 01:33:56.66
There's mental exercise, there's mental toughness

1469
01:33:56.66 --> 01:33:58.30
exercises in there, there's doing, you know,

1470
01:33:58.30 --> 01:34:00.02
discipline all these things.

1471
01:34:00.02 --> 01:34:02.42
Oh yeah, and hand their more, like,

1472
01:34:02.42 --> 01:34:05.86
they're longer lasting, like things to develop,

1473
01:34:05.86 --> 01:34:07.18
you know, like when you develop them,

1474
01:34:07.18 --> 01:34:08.50
they apply them more things.

1475
01:34:08.50 --> 01:34:13.94
So I can be easily be like, hey, I don't feel like it today.

1476
01:34:13.94 --> 01:34:16.54
That's my body telling me I should rest today.

1477
01:34:16.54 --> 01:34:19.18
Yeah, I really don't feel like it physically.

1478
01:34:19.18 --> 01:34:21.86
And that is true, it's probably true,

1479
01:34:21.86 --> 01:34:25.26
but what else is true is if I can train myself

1480
01:34:25.26 --> 01:34:28.18
to power through these sorts of situations,

1481
01:34:28.18 --> 01:34:29.46
even though they're true,

1482
01:34:29.46 --> 01:34:31.58
that's gonna serve me way better in life,

1483
01:34:31.58 --> 01:34:33.82
so if I do that, that's gonna allow this.

1484
01:34:33.82 --> 01:34:35.70
Yeah, so I'm like, dang.

1485
01:34:35.70 --> 01:34:37.42
So now I got to explain some of that stuff

1486
01:34:37.42 --> 01:34:40.90
to my youngest daughter, my youngest daughter,

1487
01:34:40.90 --> 01:34:45.90
about how competition is good.

1488
01:34:46.70 --> 01:34:48.06
And the reason competition is good

1489
01:34:48.06 --> 01:34:50.02
is because life is a competition.

1490
01:34:50.02 --> 01:34:52.38
It is a straight-up competition.

1491
01:34:52.38 --> 01:34:55.26
And if you're not good at competing,

1492
01:34:55.26 --> 01:34:57.10
if you don't get comfortable with competing,

1493
01:34:57.10 --> 01:34:59.22
that's gonna be a problem when it comes time

1494
01:34:59.22 --> 01:35:01.02
to compete, which you will have to,

1495
01:35:01.02 --> 01:35:03.14
you're not gonna get through life without competing

1496
01:35:03.14 --> 01:35:05.06
for things, for whatever.

1497
01:35:05.06 --> 01:35:06.46
It doesn't happen.

1498
01:35:06.46 --> 01:35:08.14
You're gonna have to compete for a job.

1499
01:35:08.14 --> 01:35:10.22
You're gonna have to compete for,

1500
01:35:10.22 --> 01:35:15.06
to meet someone, to be your wife or husband.

1501
01:35:15.06 --> 01:35:17.10
There's a competition going on for that.

1502
01:35:17.10 --> 01:35:19.02
They're just not like down for the call,

1503
01:35:19.02 --> 01:35:19.86
it's out of the gate.

1504
01:35:19.86 --> 01:35:22.78
No, if you've got a fight off other humans,

1505
01:35:22.78 --> 01:35:25.42
to get what you want.

1506
01:35:25.42 --> 01:35:29.02
Whether it's a spouse, whether it's a job,

1507
01:35:29.02 --> 01:35:33.66
whether it's a promotion, whether it's a part in the school play.

1508
01:35:33.66 --> 01:35:35.54
There's other people that are gonna be trying,

1509
01:35:35.54 --> 01:35:37.02
I was telling my little daughter this.

1510
01:35:37.02 --> 01:35:40.18
You think they're just gonna step aside when you show up?

1511
01:35:40.18 --> 01:35:42.02
You want the lead role?

1512
01:35:42.02 --> 01:35:44.02
You know, you got it.

1513
01:35:44.02 --> 01:35:45.58
No, it's a competition.

1514
01:35:45.58 --> 01:35:47.78
And you want to destroy the competition.

1515
01:35:47.78 --> 01:35:49.58
And the way you do that is you compete,

1516
01:35:49.58 --> 01:35:51.02
you compete in different things a lot.

1517
01:35:51.02 --> 01:35:53.58
You push yourself and you figure out

1518
01:35:53.58 --> 01:35:55.14
what it takes to step up.

1519
01:35:55.14 --> 01:35:55.98
Yeah.

1520
01:35:55.98 --> 01:35:57.38
Like wrestling a lot.

1521
01:35:57.38 --> 01:36:00.34
Wrestling puts a lot of pressure on kids.

1522
01:36:00.34 --> 01:36:02.50
And it is straight competition,

1523
01:36:02.50 --> 01:36:05.62
mono, emono, or in the case of my daughter.

1524
01:36:05.62 --> 01:36:06.46
What is that?

1525
01:36:07.62 --> 01:36:08.62
Female women.

1526
01:36:08.62 --> 01:36:11.22
That's what mono versus the mono.

1527
01:36:11.22 --> 01:36:13.18
It is straight competition.

1528
01:36:13.18 --> 01:36:14.94
You against another human being.

1529
01:36:14.94 --> 01:36:16.14
One, you's gonna win.

1530
01:36:16.14 --> 01:36:19.38
One, you's gonna lose 100% of the time.

1531
01:36:19.38 --> 01:36:20.74
That's what's gonna happen.

1532
01:36:20.74 --> 01:36:22.38
And it's all on you.

1533
01:36:22.38 --> 01:36:23.22
Yeah.

1534
01:36:23.22 --> 01:36:25.94
So that's really good for people.

1535
01:36:25.94 --> 01:36:27.10
It's good for kids.

1536
01:36:27.10 --> 01:36:28.10
Yeah.

1537
01:36:28.10 --> 01:36:29.86
Well, do you just need to competition, same thing.

1538
01:36:29.86 --> 01:36:32.34
And then you just get, you can just say any kind of competition.

1539
01:36:32.34 --> 01:36:33.34
Yeah.

1540
01:36:33.34 --> 01:36:35.90
Yeah, it's like a, well, a dichotomy, too.

1541
01:36:35.90 --> 01:36:38.58
You know, in the spirit of accuracy,

1542
01:36:38.58 --> 01:36:40.82
it's kind of like life.

1543
01:36:40.82 --> 01:36:44.30
Not to get too deep here, but life is half competition,

1544
01:36:44.30 --> 01:36:45.98
half collaboration.

1545
01:36:45.98 --> 01:36:47.66
So it could be different.

1546
01:36:47.66 --> 01:36:49.26
It could be 60, 40 and whatever.

1547
01:36:49.26 --> 01:36:50.10
Whatever.

1548
01:36:50.10 --> 01:36:51.86
You're 100% competition for me in a bunch of

1549
01:36:51.86 --> 01:36:52.86
collaborations for you.

1550
01:36:52.86 --> 01:36:53.86
But, but.

1551
01:36:53.86 --> 01:36:58.86
Yeah.

1552
01:36:58.86 --> 01:37:02.02
But here's the thing where, yeah, you get people who lean too far towards competition.

1553
01:37:02.02 --> 01:37:05.70
They start to alienate people and they can't, you know, maintain relationships like all these

1554
01:37:05.70 --> 01:37:06.70
problems.

1555
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:08.02
They're playing the short game.

1556
01:37:08.02 --> 01:37:09.02
Sort game.

1557
01:37:09.02 --> 01:37:10.02
Yes.

1558
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:11.02
And the collaboration.

1559
01:37:11.02 --> 01:37:12.50
If there's a long game, that's not a factor.

1560
01:37:12.50 --> 01:37:13.50
Yeah.

1561
01:37:13.50 --> 01:37:16.74
Because they're realizing, oh, I'm gonna win in the long game.

1562
01:37:16.74 --> 01:37:20.06
So this short game is a sacrifice, you know, problem.

1563
01:37:20.06 --> 01:37:21.06
Oh, yes.

1564
01:37:21.06 --> 01:37:23.62
I want to, you know, I'm not gonna do something that's gonna create

1565
01:37:23.62 --> 01:37:27.70
an antagonistic relationship with these people that I'm gonna count on in the future.

1566
01:37:27.70 --> 01:37:28.70
So guess what?

1567
01:37:28.70 --> 01:37:30.50
We're gonna take a little hit right now.

1568
01:37:30.50 --> 01:37:33.94
We're gonna make something, you know, you make compromises because you're focused

1569
01:37:33.94 --> 01:37:38.18
on the long game because ultimately, it is a competition.

1570
01:37:38.18 --> 01:37:39.18
Yeah.

1571
01:37:39.18 --> 01:37:40.18
Well, it is a competition.

1572
01:37:40.18 --> 01:37:41.18
Sure.

1573
01:37:41.18 --> 01:37:42.78
Um, not everything's a competition.

1574
01:37:42.78 --> 01:37:44.78
It's a lot of it is a collaboration.

1575
01:37:44.78 --> 01:37:48.26
But within, I mean, most times we collaborate to compete.

1576
01:37:48.26 --> 01:37:49.26
Yeah.

1577
01:37:49.26 --> 01:37:52.50
So it is, it's like a little balance, like a little dance you're doing with

1578
01:37:52.50 --> 01:37:53.82
collaboration competition.

1579
01:37:53.82 --> 01:37:56.58
That's why I think anyway, I don't know.

1580
01:37:56.58 --> 01:38:03.42
But from what I can view or see observed that, yeah, if you lean too much towards competition,

1581
01:38:03.42 --> 01:38:07.42
yes, you, you drive yourself up and if you can do much towards collaboration.

1582
01:38:07.42 --> 01:38:08.42
It is a dichotomy.

1583
01:38:08.42 --> 01:38:09.42
You drive yourself up too.

1584
01:38:09.42 --> 01:38:11.22
It's like you can't, you can't succeed.

1585
01:38:11.22 --> 01:38:14.54
It's like you can't get out of like, you little cow.

1586
01:38:14.54 --> 01:38:15.86
Yeah, it should be balanced.

1587
01:38:15.86 --> 01:38:19.90
And if you are competing on things, because there's people that compete on things,

1588
01:38:19.90 --> 01:38:20.90
they don't matter.

1589
01:38:20.90 --> 01:38:21.90
Yeah.

1590
01:38:21.90 --> 01:38:24.50
And then while, or they compete when they should be collaborating.

1591
01:38:24.50 --> 01:38:25.50
Yeah.

1592
01:38:25.50 --> 01:38:26.50
That's true, too.

1593
01:38:26.50 --> 01:38:29.10
Or they're afraid to compete.

1594
01:38:29.10 --> 01:38:30.34
So they don't compete at all.

1595
01:38:30.34 --> 01:38:31.34
Yeah.

1596
01:38:31.34 --> 01:38:32.34
So there's all kinds of problems.

1597
01:38:32.34 --> 01:38:39.78
But yes, I, what am I, I'm speaking a little bit simplified for my daughter, because

1598
01:38:39.78 --> 01:38:44.66
what my daughter, when I want my kids to realize is that there is competition.

1599
01:38:44.66 --> 01:38:45.66
Yeah.

1600
01:38:45.66 --> 01:38:47.78
And that they're part of it, whether they want to be or not, that's the point that I'm

1601
01:38:47.78 --> 01:38:48.78
trying to make.

1602
01:38:48.78 --> 01:38:53.18
So when I talked to my daughter about something, and she gives me a kind of a shoulder

1603
01:38:53.18 --> 01:38:55.02
shoulder, a shoulder about something.

1604
01:38:55.02 --> 01:39:01.90
When it's not a shoulder, a shoulder situation, then you are understanding that things

1605
01:39:01.90 --> 01:39:03.66
are a competition.

1606
01:39:03.66 --> 01:39:06.06
And life is a competition.

1607
01:39:06.06 --> 01:39:08.78
And you know what?

1608
01:39:08.78 --> 01:39:15.42
It is hard to say, it's, it's, it's very extreme to say everything in life or life

1609
01:39:15.42 --> 01:39:18.54
in general or life as a whole is a competition.

1610
01:39:18.54 --> 01:39:19.86
That's a real extreme statement.

1611
01:39:19.86 --> 01:39:22.10
And I can see I totally agree with your point.

1612
01:39:22.10 --> 01:39:29.66
And you are correct that that can result in then a bad attitude.

1613
01:39:29.66 --> 01:39:32.02
And really, not even just a bad attitude, a bad life.

1614
01:39:32.02 --> 01:39:35.62
I mean, you can end up, like you said, you can alienate everyone and you can end up alone

1615
01:39:35.62 --> 01:39:37.58
and you're competing and you're, I beat that person.

1616
01:39:37.58 --> 01:39:38.58
I beat that person.

1617
01:39:38.58 --> 01:39:41.82
And now you're just, you've lost, that's the thing.

1618
01:39:41.82 --> 01:39:47.66
You've lost a whole section of your competition, which is developing relationships with

1619
01:39:47.66 --> 01:39:51.38
other human beings that you can then count upon in your times of need or that you can

1620
01:39:51.38 --> 01:39:52.38
provide for.

1621
01:39:52.38 --> 01:39:54.94
It's like, all you've ruined everything.

1622
01:39:54.94 --> 01:40:01.30
So, but what I'm saying is even that right there, if you think about it in terms of what

1623
01:40:01.30 --> 01:40:05.02
I just said, you lost.

1624
01:40:05.02 --> 01:40:10.74
So ultimately, to win the competition, you have to be aware of it.

1625
01:40:10.74 --> 01:40:12.26
You have to compete.

1626
01:40:12.26 --> 01:40:17.82
Competing, this is probably the crux of what we're trying to say, competing doesn't always

1627
01:40:17.82 --> 01:40:20.82
mean.

1628
01:40:20.82 --> 01:40:22.82
Competing smashing the other person.

1629
01:40:22.82 --> 01:40:23.82
Yeah.

1630
01:40:23.82 --> 01:40:25.54
Competing doesn't always mean that.

1631
01:40:25.54 --> 01:40:29.18
Sometimes competing means actually letting the other person win.

1632
01:40:29.18 --> 01:40:30.18
Yeah.

1633
01:40:30.18 --> 01:40:37.34
Competing sometimes means letting get compromising because I'm going to win the long game.

1634
01:40:37.34 --> 01:40:39.02
I'm playing a long game over here.

1635
01:40:39.02 --> 01:40:40.02
Yeah.

1636
01:40:40.02 --> 01:40:41.82
And you're playing around with the short game.

1637
01:40:41.82 --> 01:40:42.82
It'd be a good job.

1638
01:40:42.82 --> 01:40:43.82
I'm going to applaud you.

1639
01:40:43.82 --> 01:40:44.82
Maybe golf clap.

1640
01:40:44.82 --> 01:40:45.82
Yeah.

1641
01:40:45.82 --> 01:40:47.82
Yeah, man.

1642
01:40:47.82 --> 01:40:48.82
It's true.

1643
01:40:48.82 --> 01:40:51.66
Because you can collaborate all you want.

1644
01:40:51.66 --> 01:40:55.86
But if you have, like how you put it, the long game, which is really, really effective

1645
01:40:55.86 --> 01:40:58.46
way to look at it, by the way, with everything.

1646
01:40:58.46 --> 01:41:05.58
But if you can be collaborating and be the best team player in the whole wide world.

1647
01:41:05.58 --> 01:41:09.14
But your goal, your goal, is for your team.

1648
01:41:09.14 --> 01:41:10.14
You're the team player.

1649
01:41:10.14 --> 01:41:12.02
It's for your team to win.

1650
01:41:12.02 --> 01:41:13.02
Whatever you're doing.

1651
01:41:13.02 --> 01:41:17.14
And win, I mean, here's the thing where worse, I think people get emotionally jammed

1652
01:41:17.14 --> 01:41:19.14
up when they hear like, you're a competition.

1653
01:41:19.14 --> 01:41:21.42
And that shouldn't be like that or whatever.

1654
01:41:21.42 --> 01:41:22.90
To win in life.

1655
01:41:22.90 --> 01:41:27.06
Win, mean, they think that, like, I win, you lose trying to start a bit.

1656
01:41:27.06 --> 01:41:30.38
But really when it comes up, even just genetically.

1657
01:41:30.38 --> 01:41:34.34
And Holly's say, finding a mate or reproducing whatever.

1658
01:41:34.34 --> 01:41:37.06
It's like you're survival of the fittest, right?

1659
01:41:37.06 --> 01:41:42.18
You know, when is some kind of thing, like, organisms compete for mate compete for this.

1660
01:41:42.18 --> 01:41:44.54
So it's kind of like, that's how it is.

1661
01:41:44.54 --> 01:41:47.42
You know, it's not like I'm a person, you're a person.

1662
01:41:47.42 --> 01:41:50.30
I'm going to win and defeat you and you're the loser.

1663
01:41:50.30 --> 01:41:51.30
It's not that thing.

1664
01:41:51.30 --> 01:41:53.58
It's like basically you want to be successful.

1665
01:41:53.58 --> 01:41:59.38
And for for most situations for you to be successful, you have to kind of, you have

1666
01:41:59.38 --> 01:42:02.50
to beat someone out of them.

1667
01:42:02.50 --> 01:42:03.50
Them being successful.

1668
01:42:03.50 --> 01:42:06.22
And in order to be successful, you also have to play the game.

1669
01:42:06.22 --> 01:42:12.78
You also have to play the game by the rules, because otherwise you end up ostracized or in jail,

1670
01:42:12.78 --> 01:42:13.78
right?

1671
01:42:13.78 --> 01:42:14.78
Because you could say, I'm going to win.

1672
01:42:14.78 --> 01:42:16.58
That's what I'm going to make the most money.

1673
01:42:16.58 --> 01:42:17.86
So I'm going to be no mistylet from people.

1674
01:42:17.86 --> 01:42:21.14
I'm going to do immoral things in order to get there.

1675
01:42:21.14 --> 01:42:26.06
That would be everything's a competition attitude, but it's the wrong attitude.

1676
01:42:26.06 --> 01:42:27.22
Because you're not going to win in the end.

1677
01:42:27.22 --> 01:42:28.22
You're going to lose.

1678
01:42:28.22 --> 01:42:29.98
You're going to be in jail.

1679
01:42:29.98 --> 01:42:31.58
So you lost.

1680
01:42:31.58 --> 01:42:36.42
But if you realize that it is a competition, and you have to play the rules, and you have

1681
01:42:36.42 --> 01:42:40.06
to win the game, and winning the game means that you are successful in a place where you

1682
01:42:40.06 --> 01:42:42.50
can help other people, and you've got what you need.

1683
01:42:42.50 --> 01:42:44.30
And that's what we're looking for.

1684
01:42:44.30 --> 01:42:45.30
Yeah.

1685
01:42:45.30 --> 01:42:46.30
Yeah.

1686
01:42:46.30 --> 01:42:49.50
Definitely dichotomy with that one.

1687
01:42:49.50 --> 01:42:53.10
Speaking of dichotomy, going back to the book, it is possible.

1688
01:42:53.10 --> 01:42:59.58
It is as possible to be literally blinded by rage as it is to be paralyzed by fear.

1689
01:42:59.58 --> 01:43:04.74
The prize fighter knows that he can win against a stronger and more skilled opponent.

1690
01:43:04.74 --> 01:43:09.62
If he can rouse his opponent to violent anger in which he strikes wildly and fails to use

1691
01:43:09.62 --> 01:43:10.62
his science.

1692
01:43:10.62 --> 01:43:11.62
We'll see that all the time.

1693
01:43:11.62 --> 01:43:14.82
You've got to maintain your composure.

1694
01:43:14.82 --> 01:43:20.06
You know, fight on the mats, even on the mats of justice for the jujitsu.

1695
01:43:20.06 --> 01:43:21.06
Oh, yeah.

1696
01:43:21.06 --> 01:43:22.06
Big time.

1697
01:43:22.06 --> 01:43:28.22
You know what movie was like the epitome of that was a few good men.

1698
01:43:28.22 --> 01:43:29.22
Remember at the end?

1699
01:43:29.22 --> 01:43:32.42
Oh, when he was like, when he made him admit to it, yeah.

1700
01:43:32.42 --> 01:43:33.42
Yeah.

1701
01:43:33.42 --> 01:43:34.42
That's exactly what he did.

1702
01:43:34.42 --> 01:43:35.42
Don't know.

1703
01:43:35.42 --> 01:43:37.86
Took him out of the game, got him all riled up, made him.

1704
01:43:37.86 --> 01:43:38.86
This bad man.

1705
01:43:38.86 --> 01:43:39.86
That was good.

1706
01:43:39.86 --> 01:43:40.86
You can't handle the truth.

1707
01:43:40.86 --> 01:43:41.86
That's right.

1708
01:43:41.86 --> 01:43:42.94
That was a good speech, though, by the way.

1709
01:43:42.94 --> 01:43:47.98
He'd but he let the rage and the emotion cause a problem for him.

1710
01:43:47.98 --> 01:43:50.34
He couldn't just, he didn't have to do anything.

1711
01:43:50.34 --> 01:43:52.34
He could, he just kept his most of it.

1712
01:43:52.34 --> 01:43:53.34
Be like him, whatever.

1713
01:43:53.34 --> 01:43:54.34
No.

1714
01:43:54.34 --> 01:43:55.34
Didn't do it.

1715
01:43:55.34 --> 01:43:56.34
He taught him.

1716
01:43:56.34 --> 01:44:01.62
Then Tom Cruise, he played the game really well.

1717
01:44:01.62 --> 01:44:03.34
No, to attack his emotions.

1718
01:44:03.34 --> 01:44:10.98
You know, is it funny that if you understand psychology and human nature, you can actually

1719
01:44:10.98 --> 01:44:16.86
play it on someone and bring their own demise based on something that they're going to do for

1720
01:44:16.86 --> 01:44:17.86
themselves.

1721
01:44:17.86 --> 01:44:21.30
Yeah, that's why it's important to understand human nature.

1722
01:44:21.30 --> 01:44:25.98
Back to the book, the main purpose behind all the long routine of military training

1723
01:44:25.98 --> 01:44:30.10
and the pre-conditioning of troops to simulate battle conditions to drill into soldiers fighting

1724
01:44:30.10 --> 01:44:31.10
habits.

1725
01:44:31.10 --> 01:44:32.10
So deeply ingrained.

1726
01:44:32.10 --> 01:44:37.70
So intimately second nature that they will persist in the face of the most overwhelming

1727
01:44:37.70 --> 01:44:40.58
provocations to rage or panic.

1728
01:44:40.58 --> 01:44:45.34
Long practice in shooting cool, yet a target without undo excitement without blood, lost,

1729
01:44:45.34 --> 01:44:50.78
makes it possible for the soldier to shoot calmly as at his target when his very life

1730
01:44:50.78 --> 01:44:53.78
and the safety of his pals are at stake.

1731
01:44:53.78 --> 01:44:55.74
His hand must not tremble then.

1732
01:44:55.74 --> 01:45:01.26
His keen eye and steady nerve must not waver.

1733
01:45:01.26 --> 01:45:06.10
Fortunately men and civilized society have been trained since early childhood to control

1734
01:45:06.10 --> 01:45:10.06
and discipline their natural impulses.

1735
01:45:10.06 --> 01:45:14.46
For the normal adult, it is entirely possible for intelligence to remain in command of his

1736
01:45:14.46 --> 01:45:20.62
behavior and for even recently acquired habits to be retained in opposition to the instinctive

1737
01:45:20.62 --> 01:45:25.70
impulses to run or drop his rifle and play it out with his fists.

1738
01:45:25.70 --> 01:45:30.34
There are many degrees of anger, however, and although the violently enraged individual

1739
01:45:30.34 --> 01:45:36.70
may be at the mercy of the enemy, a milder form of resentment of injustice and calm determination

1740
01:45:36.70 --> 01:45:44.34
to avenge cruelty, can serve to fill man with a fighting spirit that knows no defeat.

1741
01:45:44.34 --> 01:45:49.02
The difference between this cool anger and rage is like the difference between tempered

1742
01:45:49.02 --> 01:45:51.02
steel and molten iron.

1743
01:45:51.02 --> 01:45:56.22
That's a good one.

1744
01:45:56.22 --> 01:46:03.26
And the harnessed power of a Niagara that can be directed intelligently to wipe out the enemy.

1745
01:46:03.26 --> 01:46:10.98
Such deep and controlled anger is not to be roused artificially by any group before

1746
01:46:10.98 --> 01:46:12.34
any group of men.

1747
01:46:12.34 --> 01:46:15.94
It is the automatic result of an un-partnable offense.

1748
01:46:15.94 --> 01:46:20.54
It rises like an unquenchable fire when a man's house is attacked when his wife or children

1749
01:46:20.54 --> 01:46:25.18
are abused when his own native land is invaded.

1750
01:46:25.18 --> 01:46:30.78
Such anger can be used not only for actual killing of the enemy, but also to provide

1751
01:46:30.78 --> 01:46:33.30
the energy needed for work behind the lines.

1752
01:46:33.30 --> 01:46:37.54
A soldier who is determined to defeat the enemy will do anything that he feels contributes

1753
01:46:37.54 --> 01:46:41.82
to wiping out the foe, whether it is changing the tires on a truck or unloading shells

1754
01:46:41.82 --> 01:46:45.18
from a packing case or policing barracks in his training camp.

1755
01:46:45.18 --> 01:46:47.74
He will fight at his job.

1756
01:46:47.74 --> 01:46:51.86
He will do that job well and will use his own initiative to volunteer for extra duty

1757
01:46:51.86 --> 01:46:57.26
to think up ways of doing his job more quickly and more efficiently.

1758
01:46:57.26 --> 01:47:01.74
Anger is infectious and can spread from one person to another through personal contact.

1759
01:47:01.74 --> 01:47:08.82
Just to see the flushed face and tense expression of a rathy person may be enough to stir

1760
01:47:08.82 --> 01:47:10.62
anger in others.

1761
01:47:10.62 --> 01:47:18.26
The sound of anger in a raised voice or the sight of angry behavior is even more catching.

1762
01:47:18.26 --> 01:47:22.30
Anger spreads most readily when the beholder is sympathetic.

1763
01:47:22.30 --> 01:47:27.18
When he's able to put himself in the angry man's shoes, when the person who is injured

1764
01:47:27.18 --> 01:47:28.54
is one of us.

1765
01:47:28.54 --> 01:47:34.70
For this reason, the rouse, anger of a people is much greater and more moving than the

1766
01:47:34.70 --> 01:47:37.58
sum of the individual anger within the group.

1767
01:47:37.58 --> 01:47:39.90
They reinforce one another.

1768
01:47:39.90 --> 01:47:46.34
Anger shared, controlled and directed to the single purpose of destroying the enemy is a powerful

1769
01:47:46.34 --> 01:47:53.10
force for survival and for victory.

1770
01:47:53.10 --> 01:47:54.10
Anger is a gift.

1771
01:47:54.10 --> 01:47:57.82
Is that a raging atmosphere?

1772
01:47:57.82 --> 01:47:58.82
The machine is indeed.

1773
01:47:58.82 --> 01:48:01.82
Yeah, that's bad.

1774
01:48:01.82 --> 01:48:02.82
Bring it out.

1775
01:48:02.82 --> 01:48:05.22
Quotes.

1776
01:48:05.22 --> 01:48:11.70
It goes on hatred of the enemy makes sense.

1777
01:48:11.70 --> 01:48:16.98
The army is organized throughout for one single purpose, fighting.

1778
01:48:16.98 --> 01:48:20.42
Soldiers must be fighting men with a fighting spirit.

1779
01:48:20.42 --> 01:48:24.98
But somehow acts of aggression by soldiers are useless to the war effort effort and actually

1780
01:48:24.98 --> 01:48:26.74
dangerous to the army.

1781
01:48:26.74 --> 01:48:28.94
When competition, there we go.

1782
01:48:28.94 --> 01:48:33.42
When competition between companies or regiments turns into bitter rivalry, when soldiers

1783
01:48:33.42 --> 01:48:38.02
in town for a Saturday night, pick calls with each other or with the town's people.

1784
01:48:38.02 --> 01:48:43.90
When race prejudices are permitted to develop within a camp or when officers stooped professional

1785
01:48:43.90 --> 01:48:50.34
jealousy, the harmful results can be as bad as those dealt out by the enemy.

1786
01:48:50.34 --> 01:48:54.78
This is when life and I always say the enemy is outside the wire.

1787
01:48:54.78 --> 01:49:00.46
This, all those things are fighting inside the wire, fighting against ourselves.

1788
01:49:00.46 --> 01:49:04.90
Each conditions make rifts in the solidarity essential to the fighting morale.

1789
01:49:04.90 --> 01:49:09.30
They cause a deterioration of discipline, produce a state of anxiety and insecurity among

1790
01:49:09.30 --> 01:49:15.10
the troops and worst of all, to actually drain off in ineffective petty squabbles the fighting

1791
01:49:15.10 --> 01:49:19.66
energy every ounce of which is needed to bring victory.

1792
01:49:19.66 --> 01:49:25.54
The fought fal leader, knowing that no group or nation can long survive even is torn

1793
01:49:25.54 --> 01:49:31.58
by internal strife or dissension with its allies, is seriously disturbed by any tendency

1794
01:49:31.58 --> 01:49:38.90
toward personal or factual friction within his command.

1795
01:49:38.90 --> 01:49:45.70
He well knows that victory can only come if the whole group puts all its efforts into a unified

1796
01:49:45.70 --> 01:49:51.66
cooperative battle against the common enemy.

1797
01:49:51.66 --> 01:49:59.98
You always end up with these little factions right and you have to try and prevent that.

1798
01:49:59.98 --> 01:50:02.58
You gotta watch out for those.

1799
01:50:02.58 --> 01:50:03.58
They sneak up on you.

1800
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:05.38
It happens in any organization.

1801
01:50:05.38 --> 01:50:09.54
People start to relate to each other and then they pick a little common enemy even when

1802
01:50:09.54 --> 01:50:12.66
inside the wire and it's like the us against them.

1803
01:50:12.66 --> 01:50:17.70
Yeah, that's true, because in picking a common enemy even on a social level whatever that

1804
01:50:17.70 --> 01:50:25.18
like promotes cohesion within a group, like apparently from what I read is like gossip.

1805
01:50:25.18 --> 01:50:26.54
There's a purpose for gossip.

1806
01:50:26.54 --> 01:50:29.82
If people gossip, it makes them like bond.

1807
01:50:29.82 --> 01:50:30.82
It's weird.

1808
01:50:30.82 --> 01:50:31.82
Yeah, yeah, no.

1809
01:50:31.82 --> 01:50:33.82
Actually, there's this book talks about rumors.

1810
01:50:33.82 --> 01:50:34.82
Yeah.

1811
01:50:34.82 --> 01:50:35.82
We're going to talk about that.

1812
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:42.42
What are the fruitful ripe terrain for rumors to grow for gossip to grow?

1813
01:50:42.42 --> 01:50:43.42
Yeah.

1814
01:50:43.42 --> 01:50:44.42
But the act of doing it.

1815
01:50:44.42 --> 01:50:45.42
Maybe that's part of the reason.

1816
01:50:45.42 --> 01:50:50.06
Part of the reason if you and I need something to connect on, we'll just make fun of

1817
01:50:50.06 --> 01:50:51.06
this guy.

1818
01:50:51.06 --> 01:50:52.58
We'll talk about this guy.

1819
01:50:52.58 --> 01:50:54.22
And we kind of bond, right?

1820
01:50:54.22 --> 01:50:59.74
If you hate this guy and I hate this guy, we're both made when the game's saw you.

1821
01:50:59.74 --> 01:51:06.94
So, and this says, and you say that you should you should try to prevent those little

1822
01:51:06.94 --> 01:51:08.94
like what you click or whatever.

1823
01:51:08.94 --> 01:51:09.94
Yeah.

1824
01:51:09.94 --> 01:51:14.34
Is there, do you think there's benefit to them actually?

1825
01:51:14.34 --> 01:51:17.10
There is benefit to some of those little, little, little, little.

1826
01:51:17.10 --> 01:51:18.10
I don't know, little, little.

1827
01:51:18.10 --> 01:51:20.02
There are benefits, but it has to be balanced.

1828
01:51:20.02 --> 01:51:21.02
Because guess what?

1829
01:51:21.02 --> 01:51:23.26
I'm the task unit commander of task unit bruiser.

1830
01:51:23.26 --> 01:51:25.50
I have Charlie and Delta Patoon.

1831
01:51:25.50 --> 01:51:30.46
I want Charlie and Delta Patoon to be competitive against each other so that they're pushing

1832
01:51:30.46 --> 01:51:35.58
to try and become, trying make each other or trying become their best so they can talk

1833
01:51:35.58 --> 01:51:36.58
smack to the other guys.

1834
01:51:36.58 --> 01:51:37.58
We beat you in this thing.

1835
01:51:37.58 --> 01:51:38.58
We beat you in that thing.

1836
01:51:38.58 --> 01:51:39.58
Okay, cool.

1837
01:51:39.58 --> 01:51:40.58
That's positive.

1838
01:51:40.58 --> 01:51:42.22
I want that to happen.

1839
01:51:42.22 --> 01:51:47.62
But I don't want is Delta Patoon figures out a good standard operating procedure and doesn't

1840
01:51:47.62 --> 01:51:52.42
share it with Charlie Patoon because we want to keep out performing them on this drill or

1841
01:51:52.42 --> 01:51:53.42
vice versa.

1842
01:51:53.42 --> 01:51:54.98
That's what we don't want to have happen.

1843
01:51:54.98 --> 01:51:56.78
So you've got to balance these dichotomies.

1844
01:51:56.78 --> 01:51:57.78
Yes.

1845
01:51:57.78 --> 01:51:58.98
And you want to have these little competitive groups.

1846
01:51:58.98 --> 01:51:59.98
And inside, guess what?

1847
01:51:59.98 --> 01:52:02.86
Inside of Charlie Patoon, there's squad one and squad two.

1848
01:52:02.86 --> 01:52:04.78
They should compete with each other.

1849
01:52:04.78 --> 01:52:09.58
And inside squad one and squad two, inside squad one, you got Fire Team one and Fire Team

1850
01:52:09.58 --> 01:52:10.58
two.

1851
01:52:10.58 --> 01:52:11.58
And they're competing with each other.

1852
01:52:11.58 --> 01:52:14.18
And then inside that Fire Team, we got two swim pairs.

1853
01:52:14.18 --> 01:52:15.54
And they're competing with each other.

1854
01:52:15.54 --> 01:52:20.26
So you want to establish that healthy competition.

1855
01:52:20.26 --> 01:52:26.26
But what you want to make sure is that it doesn't cross the boundary into sabotage.

1856
01:52:26.26 --> 01:52:27.26
Right.

1857
01:52:27.26 --> 01:52:28.26
Yeah.

1858
01:52:28.26 --> 01:52:32.06
So it's like it has to remain at all times.

1859
01:52:32.06 --> 01:52:39.50
Has to remain within the boundary of the team goal.

1860
01:52:39.50 --> 01:52:41.06
Like he can never cross over that.

1861
01:52:41.06 --> 01:52:42.06
Right.

1862
01:52:42.06 --> 01:52:44.06
Like it has to be.

1863
01:52:44.06 --> 01:52:46.10
It all has to support the team goal.

1864
01:52:46.10 --> 01:52:47.10
Right.

1865
01:52:47.10 --> 01:52:48.10
Whatever.

1866
01:52:48.10 --> 01:52:49.10
Yes.

1867
01:52:49.10 --> 01:52:56.58
Like it never be taking away from the fact that we have a unified mission to execute and achieve.

1868
01:52:56.58 --> 01:53:02.06
We can never let anything undermine that goal.

1869
01:53:02.06 --> 01:53:03.06
Yeah.

1870
01:53:03.06 --> 01:53:04.06
Ever.

1871
01:53:04.06 --> 01:53:08.62
And that right there.

1872
01:53:08.62 --> 01:53:11.22
We throw around this term, putting the mission first.

1873
01:53:11.22 --> 01:53:12.22
Right.

1874
01:53:12.22 --> 01:53:13.22
Like, oh, you got to put the mission first.

1875
01:53:13.22 --> 01:53:14.94
We throw that around.

1876
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:22.82
But if you think that through to its ultimate end, it is the most powerful force that you

1877
01:53:22.82 --> 01:53:29.26
can have from a leadership perspective, from the way that you operate and the decisions

1878
01:53:29.26 --> 01:53:30.26
that you make.

1879
01:53:30.26 --> 01:53:33.38
Because you look at some decision that get needs to get made.

1880
01:53:33.38 --> 01:53:38.38
And if you truly ask yourself the question, okay.

1881
01:53:38.38 --> 01:53:43.38
How will this move us towards our objective in a positive way?

1882
01:53:43.38 --> 01:53:45.94
If it will, okay, we're moving in the right direction.

1883
01:53:45.94 --> 01:53:46.94
Sounds like a day.

1884
01:53:46.94 --> 01:53:51.22
If it's not doing that, it's the wrong decision to make.

1885
01:53:51.22 --> 01:53:55.34
And so it comes time to fire someone.

1886
01:53:55.34 --> 01:53:59.90
You're firing this person because they talk back to you and they were, they got a bad

1887
01:53:59.90 --> 01:54:00.90
attitude.

1888
01:54:00.90 --> 01:54:01.90
Okay.

1889
01:54:01.90 --> 01:54:04.10
So then you ask yourself, okay, what does this do to our mission?

1890
01:54:04.10 --> 01:54:06.26
Our ability to execute our mission.

1891
01:54:06.26 --> 01:54:11.14
Well, the guy's a turd and he doesn't know his job well and he's been slacking off,

1892
01:54:11.14 --> 01:54:13.26
okay, and no one likes him.

1893
01:54:13.26 --> 01:54:14.26
Guess what?

1894
01:54:14.26 --> 01:54:15.26
He's getting fired.

1895
01:54:15.26 --> 01:54:16.98
But okay, wait a second.

1896
01:54:16.98 --> 01:54:18.82
I don't like him.

1897
01:54:18.82 --> 01:54:21.26
I don't like him because he rubs me the wrong way.

1898
01:54:21.26 --> 01:54:24.42
I don't like him because he's got a big ego, which means he's brushing up against

1899
01:54:24.42 --> 01:54:27.54
my big ego, which is making me hold it against him.

1900
01:54:27.54 --> 01:54:30.06
And by the way, he's come up with a couple of ideas that were better than mine and

1901
01:54:30.06 --> 01:54:31.70
I resent him for that.

1902
01:54:31.70 --> 01:54:35.94
And by the way, he's asked some questions during my last brief that were really hard

1903
01:54:35.94 --> 01:54:36.94
for me to answer.

1904
01:54:36.94 --> 01:54:37.94
He kind of put me on the spot, right?

1905
01:54:37.94 --> 01:54:39.66
So all these things.

1906
01:54:39.66 --> 01:54:43.26
And so I rack those things up and I start, and now I put together my little click, who's

1907
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:44.26
now I starts in.

1908
01:54:44.26 --> 01:54:47.70
He did this and he did this on this op and all this and I got a reason.

1909
01:54:47.70 --> 01:54:48.70
Yeah.

1910
01:54:48.70 --> 01:54:52.90
And now I need to ask myself, okay, am I furthering the mission?

1911
01:54:52.90 --> 01:54:54.42
If I get rid of who's going to replace him.

1912
01:54:54.42 --> 01:54:56.98
He has experience, who's going to replace that experience.

1913
01:54:56.98 --> 01:55:00.58
He's another body who's going to replace that other body.

1914
01:55:00.58 --> 01:55:05.26
And so if you make your decisions based on what's good for the team, by the way, what's

1915
01:55:05.26 --> 01:55:07.34
good for the team is what's good for the mission.

1916
01:55:07.34 --> 01:55:08.86
You have a team to accomplish the mission.

1917
01:55:08.86 --> 01:55:11.58
If your team is dysfunctional, you're not going to accomplish the mission.

1918
01:55:11.58 --> 01:55:16.98
If your team is destroyed or part of your team is lost, you can't accomplish the mission.

1919
01:55:16.98 --> 01:55:23.34
So if you really truly look is what I'm doing accomplisher, what about your family, right?

1920
01:55:23.34 --> 01:55:27.50
Your family mission is to provide for your family and take care of your family.

1921
01:55:27.50 --> 01:55:33.34
When you start looking at things from that standpoint, hey, I really want to get this new

1922
01:55:33.34 --> 01:55:34.34
car.

1923
01:55:34.34 --> 01:55:35.34
Yeah.

1924
01:55:35.34 --> 01:55:36.34
Right?

1925
01:55:36.34 --> 01:55:38.34
I really like this new car.

1926
01:55:38.34 --> 01:55:39.34
Sure.

1927
01:55:39.34 --> 01:55:41.82
Okay, we know that that's an emotional decision.

1928
01:55:41.82 --> 01:55:44.70
Buying cars for most people is a emotional decision.

1929
01:55:44.70 --> 01:55:46.90
Myself included.

1930
01:55:46.90 --> 01:55:51.46
Americans, as I'm just Americans, people, love cars.

1931
01:55:51.46 --> 01:55:58.94
I don't know if it's because the advertising thing, but cars represent freedom.

1932
01:55:58.94 --> 01:56:05.82
You have the ability to travel hundreds and thousands of miles on your own accord.

1933
01:56:05.82 --> 01:56:11.42
And maybe you just need to travel to the grocery market, but still the car gives you freedom.

1934
01:56:11.42 --> 01:56:15.82
And then the car in a deeper level is a reflection of you.

1935
01:56:15.82 --> 01:56:16.82
Yeah, you're a identity.

1936
01:56:16.82 --> 01:56:17.82
It's true.

1937
01:56:17.82 --> 01:56:21.94
Yeah, this is it's literally something that you get inside of.

1938
01:56:21.94 --> 01:56:28.62
And when people look at it, they're looking at the metal and steel version of you.

1939
01:56:28.62 --> 01:56:29.62
Your own mind.

1940
01:56:29.62 --> 01:56:30.62
Yes.

1941
01:56:30.62 --> 01:56:40.14
So it can be hard to drive a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan with an duct tape on the window.

1942
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:41.14
It can be hard.

1943
01:56:41.14 --> 01:56:45.58
The fires, the fires in San Diego in 2003, were you here for those?

1944
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:47.46
Yes, they poured ash everywhere.

1945
01:56:47.46 --> 01:56:48.86
So that ruined a lot of paint.

1946
01:56:48.86 --> 01:56:54.18
If the cars were sitting outside, so my 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan had all peeled paint.

1947
01:56:54.18 --> 01:56:58.30
Look like just horrible.

1948
01:56:58.30 --> 01:57:03.50
The old paint is like a dark red, but then there were these flakes of clear stuff all

1949
01:57:03.50 --> 01:57:06.02
over it falling off.

1950
01:57:06.02 --> 01:57:12.62
So if you looked at that car and I saw that car as a reflection of me, it was pretty

1951
01:57:12.62 --> 01:57:18.22
low reflection, nothing gets my brothers out there that are driving the many vans.

1952
01:57:18.22 --> 01:57:19.22
Props.

1953
01:57:19.22 --> 01:57:20.22
You got the family.

1954
01:57:20.22 --> 01:57:21.70
You make that your priority.

1955
01:57:21.70 --> 01:57:28.70
Because what I could have done back in the day was say, you know what, I really want to get

1956
01:57:28.70 --> 01:57:29.70
whatever.

1957
01:57:29.70 --> 01:57:38.58
The Ford F350 Super Duty Doole Extended King Cab.

1958
01:57:38.58 --> 01:57:39.58
You know what I'm saying?

1959
01:57:39.58 --> 01:57:40.58
Look, trim.

1960
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:41.98
That's me.

1961
01:57:41.98 --> 01:57:45.14
I want to look like that on the outside.

1962
01:57:45.14 --> 01:57:46.78
So then what is my decision making, bro?

1963
01:57:46.78 --> 01:57:47.78
Do I need that vehicle?

1964
01:57:47.78 --> 01:57:50.38
I live in San Diego by the way.

1965
01:57:50.38 --> 01:57:52.18
I live in San Diego.

1966
01:57:52.18 --> 01:57:53.18
What do I do with my vehicle?

1967
01:57:53.18 --> 01:57:54.18
I drive to work.

1968
01:57:54.18 --> 01:57:55.18
I drive home.

1969
01:57:55.18 --> 01:57:57.26
I take my kids to the Jitsu tournaments.

1970
01:57:57.26 --> 01:57:58.78
That's what I do with my vehicle.

1971
01:57:58.78 --> 01:58:06.10
Do I need a F350 Super Duty Doole Extended Cab Diesel 7.3 Power Stroke Engine.

1972
01:58:06.10 --> 01:58:07.10
Do I need that?

1973
01:58:07.10 --> 01:58:08.10
I don't know.

1974
01:58:08.10 --> 01:58:09.10
Kind of.

1975
01:58:09.10 --> 01:58:10.10
No.

1976
01:58:10.10 --> 01:58:11.10
I don't.

1977
01:58:11.10 --> 01:58:12.10
So what is the mission?

1978
01:58:12.10 --> 01:58:13.10
What is the mission?

1979
01:58:13.10 --> 01:58:16.50
First of all, we know that when I buy a car, it's going down in value.

1980
01:58:16.50 --> 01:58:22.38
I buy a piece of property, I buy a house, I buy a home that's going to go up in value.

1981
01:58:22.38 --> 01:58:25.70
Over time, sure, it might go up and down a little bit, but over time it's going to go

1982
01:58:25.70 --> 01:58:26.70
up in value.

1983
01:58:26.70 --> 01:58:32.66
Over time, my kids can have that in 30 years that they don't want that Ford in 30

1984
01:58:32.66 --> 01:58:33.66
years.

1985
01:58:33.66 --> 01:58:35.86
That things barely even run in 30 years.

1986
01:58:35.86 --> 01:58:37.94
So what is my mission?

1987
01:58:37.94 --> 01:58:41.46
My mission is to provide for the family, protect the family, take care of the family,

1988
01:58:41.46 --> 01:58:44.54
set them up for success in the future.

1989
01:58:44.54 --> 01:58:46.02
What do I need to drive?

1990
01:58:46.02 --> 01:58:48.86
I need to drive a Dodge Caravan.

1991
01:58:48.86 --> 01:58:50.50
That's what I need to drive.

1992
01:58:50.50 --> 01:58:51.50
I understand.

1993
01:58:51.50 --> 01:58:56.94
So if you frame things correctly about what your broad mission is, you're going to do

1994
01:58:56.94 --> 01:58:59.62
better off, you're going to make better decisions as a leader.

1995
01:58:59.62 --> 01:59:02.42
That's the way it's going to be.

1996
01:59:02.42 --> 01:59:07.42
Oh.

1997
01:59:07.42 --> 01:59:14.62
And by the way, speaking of leaders, here we go back to the book.

1998
01:59:14.62 --> 01:59:23.34
The most serious of all causes for an epidemic of dissension is the bad leader.

1999
01:59:23.34 --> 01:59:28.78
When, as sometimes happens in any organization like an army, men have placed over them

2000
01:59:28.78 --> 01:59:31.58
a man, they do not trust.

2001
01:59:31.58 --> 01:59:39.82
One who loves to show his authority and throw his rank around on unreasonable, martinette.

2002
01:59:39.82 --> 01:59:43.82
The whole outfit will be filled with resentment.

2003
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:48.22
This is impossible to show this antagonism to the officer who is at fault.

2004
01:59:48.22 --> 01:59:52.82
The troops go around with chips on their shoulders, daring each other to knock them off.

2005
01:59:52.82 --> 01:59:57.66
The only way to wipe out such an infection of dissension is to track down and remove the

2006
01:59:57.66 --> 01:59:58.66
cause.

2007
01:59:58.66 --> 02:00:04.82
If men believe they have a grievance, even if the complaint is unjustified, they should

2008
02:00:04.82 --> 02:00:09.26
be permitted to tell their troubles to someone in authority.

2009
02:00:09.26 --> 02:00:14.98
If an officer gives them a patient hearing, investigates conditions with a fair and open

2010
02:00:14.98 --> 02:00:19.34
mind and explains his findings to the men, they will usually be satisfied.

2011
02:00:19.34 --> 02:00:24.90
Even in cases where it is impossible to do much to correct the objectionable state of affairs.

2012
02:00:24.90 --> 02:00:26.94
This is such good advice.

2013
02:00:26.94 --> 02:00:27.94
Guess what?

2014
02:00:27.94 --> 02:00:30.86
When you're in a leadership position, you're going to have people that are going to complain

2015
02:00:30.86 --> 02:00:32.98
about things they're going to see problems.

2016
02:00:32.98 --> 02:00:37.42
And what you should do in those situations is less than.

2017
02:00:37.42 --> 02:00:42.66
Listen to what the team has to say, listen to what that individual has to say.

2018
02:00:42.66 --> 02:00:44.94
Get feedback.

2019
02:00:44.94 --> 02:00:47.34
That's what you should do.

2020
02:00:47.34 --> 02:00:52.26
Back to the book, just telling their troubles to a willing listener serves to get the air

2021
02:00:52.26 --> 02:00:53.26
cleared.

2022
02:00:53.26 --> 02:00:58.30
And in cases where men make constructive suggestions for correcting conditions, they will

2023
02:00:58.30 --> 02:01:02.90
take in the organization a pride that they never had before.

2024
02:01:02.90 --> 02:01:04.82
So, guys, tell us what you're doing.

2025
02:01:04.82 --> 02:01:08.02
Listen up, that I asked you to do something to give suggestions, use it and get them

2026
02:01:08.02 --> 02:01:10.02
credit.

2027
02:01:10.02 --> 02:01:14.50
These are reasons why for many years in our army, any officer or soldier has been free

2028
02:01:14.50 --> 02:01:19.06
to telegrevens to the Inspector General said periodically to each place where there are

2029
02:01:19.06 --> 02:01:20.06
troops.

2030
02:01:20.06 --> 02:01:26.06
Inspector General's like an internal affairs type situation.

2031
02:01:26.06 --> 02:01:28.50
But you should need to resort to that.

2032
02:01:28.50 --> 02:01:32.30
If you're a good commander and a good leader when the internal affairs people show up, they

2033
02:01:32.30 --> 02:01:34.50
get told, hey, everything's awesome.

2034
02:01:34.50 --> 02:01:38.42
They have no grievances to put out there because they already told you and then you gave

2035
02:01:38.42 --> 02:01:40.02
them an answer.

2036
02:01:40.02 --> 02:01:42.06
And then people say, what if I can't answer the grievances?

2037
02:01:42.06 --> 02:01:44.42
Well, then you figure out what the answer is.

2038
02:01:44.42 --> 02:01:50.54
If my subordinate comes to me and says, hey, this is, we're not getting the right food

2039
02:01:50.54 --> 02:01:51.54
out here.

2040
02:01:51.54 --> 02:01:53.82
Well, I don't want to say, well, sorry.

2041
02:01:53.82 --> 02:01:55.74
No, I say, okay, let me see what I can do about it.

2042
02:01:55.74 --> 02:01:56.94
Hey, this is what's going on.

2043
02:01:56.94 --> 02:02:00.54
By the way, there's a lack of flight, heading in this direction.

2044
02:02:00.54 --> 02:02:04.18
The supply trains are getting blown up by IEDs.

2045
02:02:04.18 --> 02:02:06.18
We have an alternate plan for food.

2046
02:02:06.18 --> 02:02:09.22
We're going to try and make it happen in a couple months, but right now we kind of got

2047
02:02:09.22 --> 02:02:11.10
what we got.

2048
02:02:11.10 --> 02:02:12.10
And now what do you say?

2049
02:02:12.10 --> 02:02:13.10
You screw you?

2050
02:02:13.10 --> 02:02:15.42
No, you go, okay, I understand.

2051
02:02:15.42 --> 02:02:17.86
We're at war for a kind of all out.

2052
02:02:17.86 --> 02:02:21.30
I understand I'm not going to get steak dinner every night.

2053
02:02:21.30 --> 02:02:23.30
It's not happening.

2054
02:02:23.30 --> 02:02:26.78
Even though we might want it, we're not going to get it.

2055
02:02:26.78 --> 02:02:32.50
So here are those grievances.

2056
02:02:32.50 --> 02:02:42.10
It, some people get concerned that if you start taking grievances from people, then it turns

2057
02:02:42.10 --> 02:02:44.10
into a bitch session.

2058
02:02:44.10 --> 02:02:45.10
Right?

2059
02:02:45.10 --> 02:02:47.50
You heard this word, this term before.

2060
02:02:47.50 --> 02:02:49.14
The bitch session.

2061
02:02:49.14 --> 02:02:53.38
I'm actually in general, not scared of bitch sessions.

2062
02:02:53.38 --> 02:03:00.14
I'm not scared of them because if you ask me a good question, or you ask me a question,

2063
02:03:00.14 --> 02:03:01.14
I should have an answer for it.

2064
02:03:01.14 --> 02:03:02.46
I'm the leader.

2065
02:03:02.46 --> 02:03:07.66
If you're in my platoon and you have a question for me, I should be able to answer.

2066
02:03:07.66 --> 02:03:12.38
If you have a bitch, I should be able to give you a reason why that is occurring.

2067
02:03:12.38 --> 02:03:16.34
And why we either can move forward with some kind of a corrective measure or why we cannot

2068
02:03:16.34 --> 02:03:19.98
because the following limitations that were under.

2069
02:03:19.98 --> 02:03:26.18
So I'm not really scared of bitch sessions unfolding.

2070
02:03:26.18 --> 02:03:28.18
Have I seen them become unproductive?

2071
02:03:28.18 --> 02:03:29.18
Absolutely.

2072
02:03:29.18 --> 02:03:36.78
Especially see them become unproductive when we start to like lose the conversation.

2073
02:03:36.78 --> 02:03:43.66
And if the leader, if you ask me a question and I say because, if you say, hey, why can't

2074
02:03:43.66 --> 02:03:45.54
we get better food?

2075
02:03:45.54 --> 02:03:49.94
And I say because then you say because of what?

2076
02:03:49.94 --> 02:03:52.30
And I say because I said so.

2077
02:03:52.30 --> 02:03:53.66
Now we're going to have a problem.

2078
02:03:53.66 --> 02:03:56.98
Now this bitch session just became unproductive.

2079
02:03:56.98 --> 02:04:00.18
If you say hey, Jocco, we've been here for two months.

2080
02:04:00.18 --> 02:04:01.34
Why can't we get some better food?

2081
02:04:01.34 --> 02:04:02.62
I'm like, you know what?

2082
02:04:02.62 --> 02:04:06.18
Right now I don't even know because I agree with you.

2083
02:04:06.18 --> 02:04:08.94
The food is pretty bad and I like food.

2084
02:04:08.94 --> 02:04:10.34
And so let me take a note here.

2085
02:04:10.34 --> 02:04:12.30
I'm going to write down what I've sent it up to chain of command.

2086
02:04:12.30 --> 02:04:14.38
We can figure out, what's going on?

2087
02:04:14.38 --> 02:04:18.74
Why we don't get to have good food and be if there's a way we can possibly start making

2088
02:04:18.74 --> 02:04:19.74
this happen.

2089
02:04:19.74 --> 02:04:22.18
I hear you.

2090
02:04:22.18 --> 02:04:24.50
Bitch is now subdued.

2091
02:04:24.50 --> 02:04:25.50
Right?

2092
02:04:25.50 --> 02:04:29.94
I mean, has been subdued because I gave you a legitimate answer.

2093
02:04:29.94 --> 02:04:32.54
I didn't even give you a solution by any stretch.

2094
02:04:32.54 --> 02:04:33.54
I just gave you an answer.

2095
02:04:33.54 --> 02:04:37.54
I just took your information and heard what you had to say, which is legitimate.

2096
02:04:37.54 --> 02:04:44.22
I've seen people where they they they they send up a complaint and then they get subdued.

2097
02:04:44.22 --> 02:04:46.94
But then the the leader doesn't follow up on the complaint.

2098
02:04:46.94 --> 02:04:50.10
I don't follow up and actually go up the chain of command and say why don't we get

2099
02:04:50.10 --> 02:04:52.62
better food.

2100
02:04:52.62 --> 02:04:53.62
That's going to be a problem.

2101
02:04:53.62 --> 02:04:54.90
Next session.

2102
02:04:54.90 --> 02:04:59.46
Hey, you said you're going to do some what's the answer and I say well, I'll I'll

2103
02:04:59.46 --> 02:05:03.26
I'll but the bit now you're bad.

2104
02:05:03.26 --> 02:05:05.54
Rightfully so.

2105
02:05:05.54 --> 02:05:06.94
And that's really it.

2106
02:05:06.94 --> 02:05:11.14
That's really that what tells the tale because I go case of bitch session.

2107
02:05:11.14 --> 02:05:12.14
Right.

2108
02:05:12.14 --> 02:05:17.38
That'll I mean along with complaints come what I think is more important than like the

2109
02:05:17.38 --> 02:05:22.38
complaint or the issue that's complain about more important is the motivation to complain.

2110
02:05:22.38 --> 02:05:25.34
So let's say the food is junk.

2111
02:05:25.34 --> 02:05:26.34
Right.

2112
02:05:26.34 --> 02:05:31.50
If I think if I'm mad about that, if that bothers me whether because I think the food should

2113
02:05:31.50 --> 02:05:32.82
literally be better.

2114
02:05:32.82 --> 02:05:34.14
It should be better right now.

2115
02:05:34.14 --> 02:05:35.14
Yeah.

2116
02:05:35.14 --> 02:05:37.50
I don't know why it's better right now, but I think it should be in that makes that

2117
02:05:37.50 --> 02:05:42.50
bothers me at the very least that produces a motivation to complain.

2118
02:05:42.50 --> 02:05:44.90
But if the food can be just as bad.

2119
02:05:44.90 --> 02:05:48.82
But if I have an explanation, I have no motivation to complain because I'm mad at

2120
02:05:48.82 --> 02:05:50.14
that it's understandable.

2121
02:05:50.14 --> 02:05:57.10
So a bitch session will develop when those feeling those motivations to complain are

2122
02:05:57.10 --> 02:05:58.70
maintained or escalated.

2123
02:05:58.70 --> 02:06:01.42
So like if you're like so, why?

2124
02:06:01.42 --> 02:06:03.70
Because I said so I'm still mad.

2125
02:06:03.70 --> 02:06:04.70
Totally.

2126
02:06:04.70 --> 02:06:08.74
But I'm not even a little bit more mad because the way you said that to.

2127
02:06:08.74 --> 02:06:11.58
So that's when those bitch bitch sessions will come.

2128
02:06:11.58 --> 02:06:16.26
Or if you get a couple of people making the same complaint and then another couple of people

2129
02:06:16.26 --> 02:06:19.26
like kind of refuting it or something like that.

2130
02:06:19.26 --> 02:06:24.42
Or anywhere where there's emotions kind of, and one key factor that you brought up is the

2131
02:06:24.42 --> 02:06:26.54
building up.

2132
02:06:26.54 --> 02:06:30.66
If you're constantly communicating with your people, then the bitch sessions don't build

2133
02:06:30.66 --> 02:06:31.66
up.

2134
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:35.86
It's when you decide, when do you block yourself in your own vacuum and you don't listen

2135
02:06:35.86 --> 02:06:39.94
to what anyone has to say and then once every six months you go, hey guys, we're going

2136
02:06:39.94 --> 02:06:41.18
to have a Q&A.

2137
02:06:41.18 --> 02:06:44.10
If you guys have any questions for me, you guys can come in there.

2138
02:06:44.10 --> 02:06:45.10
You guys can ask me questions.

2139
02:06:45.10 --> 02:06:47.14
Well these guys have been brewing up questions for the last six months.

2140
02:06:47.14 --> 02:06:48.14
They've been drinking.

2141
02:06:48.14 --> 02:06:52.06
They've got some questions, boy, and they're going to hit you with a mark.

2142
02:06:52.06 --> 02:06:58.06
So you, that if you want to prevent the bitch session from getting out of control, guess

2143
02:06:58.06 --> 02:07:00.26
what, communicate with your people more often.

2144
02:07:00.26 --> 02:07:02.98
It'll take that question about why is the food so bad?

2145
02:07:02.98 --> 02:07:07.74
By the time it's six months deep and that guy's been eating crappy food for six months,

2146
02:07:07.74 --> 02:07:11.02
there's almost no solution that you can provide that's going to be good for him.

2147
02:07:11.02 --> 02:07:13.06
By the way, you wasted six months of trying to find a solution.

2148
02:07:13.06 --> 02:07:14.46
So that's just wrong.

2149
02:07:14.46 --> 02:07:21.02
So you're already starting off with really negative situation.

2150
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:22.94
So communicate with your people a lot.

2151
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:23.94
Don't be afraid.

2152
02:07:23.94 --> 02:07:26.94
If you, if they ask me a question, I don't know the answer to.

2153
02:07:26.94 --> 02:07:27.94
Cool.

2154
02:07:27.94 --> 02:07:29.22
You say, hey, let me write this down.

2155
02:07:29.22 --> 02:07:31.42
Let me run this up to Chainedic Command and find out what's going on with that because

2156
02:07:31.42 --> 02:07:32.42
I don't know the answer.

2157
02:07:32.42 --> 02:07:39.10
What if they ask me a question that I don't like the answer to?

2158
02:07:39.10 --> 02:07:40.10
I don't like this.

2159
02:07:40.10 --> 02:07:42.10
I don't like what I've been told.

2160
02:07:42.10 --> 02:07:43.10
Wait, you have the leader.

2161
02:07:43.10 --> 02:07:48.18
I'm as the leader and someone says, I get told, hey, you're not getting food because

2162
02:07:48.18 --> 02:07:52.34
we prioritize one of the other potoons and they're getting all the steak, which by the way,

2163
02:07:52.34 --> 02:07:53.82
would never happen.

2164
02:07:53.82 --> 02:07:58.62
But if they did that and then someone says, hey, why are we getting this bad food?

2165
02:07:58.62 --> 02:08:01.22
And I go, well, it's because they gave it to you on the potoon.

2166
02:08:01.22 --> 02:08:06.22
I wouldn't say, I would answer the question truthfully, which is like, listen, this

2167
02:08:06.22 --> 02:08:07.34
is what's going on right now.

2168
02:08:07.34 --> 02:08:11.62
For some reason, they gave the other potoon all the steak.

2169
02:08:11.62 --> 02:08:16.98
Believe me, we have no greater champion for steak in this potoon than me.

2170
02:08:16.98 --> 02:08:22.22
I am personally flying to see the boss and I'm going to figure out what's going on.

2171
02:08:22.22 --> 02:08:23.22
We will get steak.

2172
02:08:23.22 --> 02:08:24.22
You know what I mean?

2173
02:08:24.22 --> 02:08:28.22
As opposed to just being mad or not wanting to give the answer, trying to hide it, I don't

2174
02:08:28.22 --> 02:08:29.22
know what's going on.

2175
02:08:29.22 --> 02:08:30.46
I don't know why we're not getting steak.

2176
02:08:30.46 --> 02:08:31.54
You know why you're not getting steak?

2177
02:08:31.54 --> 02:08:32.54
Tell everyone.

2178
02:08:32.54 --> 02:08:33.54
Yeah.

2179
02:08:33.54 --> 02:08:34.54
Don't.

2180
02:08:34.54 --> 02:08:35.54
The more open you are.

2181
02:08:35.54 --> 02:08:38.82
And of course, there's a dichotomy to this too because we can go too far and telling the truth.

2182
02:08:38.82 --> 02:08:43.06
We can tell people the truth about things that they don't need to know about, right?

2183
02:08:43.06 --> 02:08:44.06
Yeah.

2184
02:08:44.06 --> 02:08:47.34
So you do have to be careful about that.

2185
02:08:47.34 --> 02:08:48.34
You have to be careful.

2186
02:08:48.34 --> 02:08:51.66
You have to be judicious in telling the truth.

2187
02:08:51.66 --> 02:08:58.42
You have to make sure that it makes sense in accomplishing the long term mission.

2188
02:08:58.42 --> 02:09:03.22
If I tell everyone that we're not getting food because we got caught off and we're

2189
02:09:03.22 --> 02:09:08.70
out here on our own and we have about three days worth of food and water and by the

2190
02:09:08.70 --> 02:09:10.70
way we're not going to live and we're all going to die.

2191
02:09:10.70 --> 02:09:11.70
Yeah.

2192
02:09:11.70 --> 02:09:12.70
So we should be happy with this.

2193
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:16.34
That's that's that's not going to help my mission.

2194
02:09:16.34 --> 02:09:19.90
Now I could I could turn that into something that says listen, what here's going on right

2195
02:09:19.90 --> 02:09:24.18
now we're caught off and here's the mission of going to undertake to make this happen.

2196
02:09:24.18 --> 02:09:27.82
That's probably not a great example, but I think we all understand that there's times

2197
02:09:27.82 --> 02:09:32.14
if you screw up a video, if you put a video together for me and it's got the worst

2198
02:09:32.14 --> 02:09:33.70
Christmas music to the video.

2199
02:09:33.70 --> 02:09:34.70
Another terrible example.

2200
02:09:34.70 --> 02:09:35.70
Yeah.

2201
02:09:35.70 --> 02:09:37.98
I don't just drop the hammer on you and say you suck it at it.

2202
02:09:37.98 --> 02:09:39.98
You know, I kind of think that at the moment.

2203
02:09:39.98 --> 02:09:43.98
Instead I say hey, I like what you put together, you know, maybe can you explain why you did

2204
02:09:43.98 --> 02:09:44.98
this music selection?

2205
02:09:44.98 --> 02:09:47.98
Because for me it's a little bit different than what I would expect.

2206
02:09:47.98 --> 02:09:48.98
Sure.

2207
02:09:48.98 --> 02:09:49.98
Yeah.

2208
02:09:49.98 --> 02:09:51.98
Thank you for that.

2209
02:09:51.98 --> 02:09:52.98
Check.

2210
02:09:52.98 --> 02:09:56.98
Going back to the book incidentally, but most important.

2211
02:09:56.98 --> 02:10:00.98
I keep adding emphasis to things that are literally not this book.

2212
02:10:00.98 --> 02:10:05.98
So what that actually says is incidentally but importantly, it doesn't say most important.

2213
02:10:05.98 --> 02:10:06.98
I added that.

2214
02:10:06.98 --> 02:10:07.98
It's not.

2215
02:10:07.98 --> 02:10:08.98
There's a second time I've done that.

2216
02:10:08.98 --> 02:10:11.98
I've taken something to the next level even though just on my own accord.

2217
02:10:11.98 --> 02:10:13.98
Pay your phone just being right.

2218
02:10:13.98 --> 02:10:21.50
So what it says is incidentally in parentheses, but importantly, this method of dealing

2219
02:10:21.50 --> 02:10:27.38
with this fact, dissatisfaction cheats the fifth columnist and solbit saboteur who made

2220
02:10:27.38 --> 02:10:29.38
lurk in the camp.

2221
02:10:29.38 --> 02:10:33.42
It is much safer for the army that mentioned poor their gripes into the ears of an

2222
02:10:33.42 --> 02:10:38.74
officer than that they should spill them in a beer joint in town or in any other place where

2223
02:10:38.74 --> 02:10:40.94
outsiders can listen.

2224
02:10:40.94 --> 02:10:46.38
Another method of handling dissension and over aggression is by punishment.

2225
02:10:46.38 --> 02:10:53.94
This is the chosen method of dictatorships and auto-cratic organizations generally.

2226
02:10:53.94 --> 02:10:58.82
The method is commonly used even in America and most children have to learn that when

2227
02:10:58.82 --> 02:11:02.62
they feel aggressive punishment is not that far away.

2228
02:11:02.62 --> 02:11:09.14
So another thing you can do in somebody asks, you know a question, hey, Jocco, can you tell

2229
02:11:09.14 --> 02:11:10.14
us why we're not getting any stake?

2230
02:11:10.14 --> 02:11:11.54
I'll tell you why.

2231
02:11:11.54 --> 02:11:13.30
We're not getting stake because you haven't worked hard enough.

2232
02:11:13.30 --> 02:11:14.30
Guess what you're doing tonight.

2233
02:11:14.30 --> 02:11:17.86
K-P-Doodie or whatever.

2234
02:11:17.86 --> 02:11:22.86
When I punish you for asking your question, that's like what auto-crats do.

2235
02:11:22.86 --> 02:11:24.86
Dictators do that.

2236
02:11:24.86 --> 02:11:25.86
Back to the book.

2237
02:11:25.86 --> 02:11:30.58
Sometimes the soldiers troubles cannot be attributed to anyone person.

2238
02:11:30.58 --> 02:11:34.38
They are due to the conditions of war or of army life.

2239
02:11:34.38 --> 02:11:39.26
An ambitious and energetic man may find himself so wound up and red tape that he cannot

2240
02:11:39.26 --> 02:11:40.26
do a good job.

2241
02:11:40.26 --> 02:11:44.58
An organization may be all set to go forward to an objective but is hindered by failure

2242
02:11:44.58 --> 02:11:47.82
of supplies by shortages, by weather.

2243
02:11:47.82 --> 02:11:48.98
No one is to blame.

2244
02:11:48.98 --> 02:11:55.22
Which I kind of disagree with that statement because I was here in charge of that.

2245
02:11:55.22 --> 02:11:57.58
If you're in charge of that, then guess what?

2246
02:11:57.58 --> 02:12:00.42
You should have figured out how to get the supplies there in time.

2247
02:12:00.42 --> 02:12:02.42
You should have figured out a contingency plan for the weather.

2248
02:12:02.42 --> 02:12:09.42
But what they're talking about is sometimes things go wrong and continuing on.

2249
02:12:09.42 --> 02:12:13.58
This natural need for someone to blame and punish when things go wrong.

2250
02:12:13.58 --> 02:12:20.66
Responsible for much race and religious prejudice is also the cause for most corals that

2251
02:12:20.66 --> 02:12:25.38
grow up between allies and between one branch of the service and another.

2252
02:12:25.38 --> 02:12:28.86
So when you have these inner service rivalries, because there's no one else to blame,

2253
02:12:28.86 --> 02:12:38.90
you have organizations where the production guys, the sales guys are selling stuff and

2254
02:12:38.90 --> 02:12:43.74
the builders of the stuff, the engineers that design the stuff aren't getting it to

2255
02:12:43.74 --> 02:12:46.18
them in time.

2256
02:12:46.18 --> 02:12:47.58
When they're getting it to them in time, that's fine.

2257
02:12:47.58 --> 02:12:52.42
But this the market is down and they start to hate none each other when they should be

2258
02:12:52.42 --> 02:12:58.02
focusing on how to adjust to the market adaptations that need to be made or the market adjustments

2259
02:12:58.02 --> 02:13:01.38
that need to be made and said they're going at each other's throats.

2260
02:13:01.38 --> 02:13:02.38
Why?

2261
02:13:02.38 --> 02:13:04.30
Because they're looking for someone to blame.

2262
02:13:04.30 --> 02:13:05.94
No one look for someone to blame.

2263
02:13:05.94 --> 02:13:09.38
Figure out what the problem is and solve it.

2264
02:13:09.38 --> 02:13:14.18
Back the book, an occasional individual in any large group appears to contradict all the rules

2265
02:13:14.18 --> 02:13:16.94
about how aggression was built up.

2266
02:13:16.94 --> 02:13:21.38
He will turn nasty when he's, this is a really interesting psychological profile.

2267
02:13:21.38 --> 02:13:22.86
So I'm going to read this again.

2268
02:13:22.86 --> 02:13:27.98
An occasional individual in any large group appears to contradict all the rules about

2269
02:13:27.98 --> 02:13:30.14
how aggression was built up.

2270
02:13:30.14 --> 02:13:36.22
He will turn nasty when he is treated with kindness and becomes very docile under punishment

2271
02:13:36.22 --> 02:13:37.70
or frustration.

2272
02:13:37.70 --> 02:13:42.54
He is excessively polite and cooperative as long as he is kept in a subordinate position,

2273
02:13:42.54 --> 02:13:47.34
but when he is put in command of other man, he becomes tyrannical and overbearing.

2274
02:13:47.34 --> 02:13:52.38
Such peculiar behaviors often result of two severe punishment of self-assertion or aggressiveness

2275
02:13:52.38 --> 02:13:54.66
in childhood.

2276
02:13:54.66 --> 02:13:58.54
This man is carrying around his own grouches and resentments, bottled up inside of him.

2277
02:13:58.54 --> 02:14:02.34
He is deeply anxious to punish and hurt other people, but as long as he is faced with

2278
02:14:02.34 --> 02:14:07.06
a threat of punishment himself, he retains his childhood fear of showing his feelings.

2279
02:14:07.06 --> 02:14:11.62
As soon as other people treat him decently and no longer appear like a threat to him,

2280
02:14:11.62 --> 02:14:14.62
then his meanness lashes out.

2281
02:14:14.62 --> 02:14:20.54
People who have this curious reversal of normal reaction to other people's kindness or aggressiveness

2282
02:14:20.54 --> 02:14:25.62
often like to boast that they are tough or hard and that they respect a man who will stand

2283
02:14:25.62 --> 02:14:27.22
up to them.

2284
02:14:27.22 --> 02:14:32.06
This boast is an explanation that fools many people, even including the explainer and

2285
02:14:32.06 --> 02:14:33.06
self.

2286
02:14:33.06 --> 02:14:37.74
Actually the respect they claim to feel is nothing but an unconscious fear, a secret

2287
02:14:37.74 --> 02:14:42.42
fear that the rebellious subordinate will punish them.

2288
02:14:42.42 --> 02:14:44.74
Such men make poor leaders.

2289
02:14:44.74 --> 02:14:48.50
They make their subordinates angry and uncooperative.

2290
02:14:48.50 --> 02:14:53.22
They work best when alone.

2291
02:14:53.22 --> 02:15:04.58
And this continues on, the good leader is not afraid of criticism from his subordinates.

2292
02:15:04.58 --> 02:15:05.58
Amen.

2293
02:15:05.58 --> 02:15:07.42
I guess is what I would say to that.

2294
02:15:07.42 --> 02:15:11.22
A good leader is not afraid of criticism from the subordinates.

2295
02:15:11.22 --> 02:15:17.70
He will encourage it as a constructive and cooperative way of eliminating causes for resentment

2296
02:15:17.70 --> 02:15:19.54
and dissension.

2297
02:15:19.54 --> 02:15:23.10
And he will use it himself in dealing with his subordinates, but the criticism should

2298
02:15:23.10 --> 02:15:28.70
be constructive and directed at some true cause of the difficulty not some imagined evil

2299
02:15:28.70 --> 02:15:31.94
or some harmless and defentheless person of the group.

2300
02:15:31.94 --> 02:15:36.14
It should not be a means of passing the buck.

2301
02:15:36.14 --> 02:15:38.98
Here are some rules for critics to keep in mind.

2302
02:15:38.98 --> 02:15:45.74
So when you want to start throwing darts at the old man, one stick to things that can be

2303
02:15:45.74 --> 02:15:46.74
corrected.

2304
02:15:46.74 --> 02:15:50.50
Don't criticize dead issues or unalterable situations.

2305
02:15:50.50 --> 02:15:52.78
You even know some people just get stuck.

2306
02:15:52.78 --> 02:15:56.62
They get stuck on something and they'll just never let it go.

2307
02:15:56.62 --> 02:15:58.58
Hey, that happened three months ago.

2308
02:15:58.58 --> 02:16:00.38
I get it was a bad decision.

2309
02:16:00.38 --> 02:16:02.74
If I could go back and time, I'd do it in a different way.

2310
02:16:02.74 --> 02:16:03.74
I didn't.

2311
02:16:03.74 --> 02:16:06.18
That's the call that got made.

2312
02:16:06.18 --> 02:16:10.74
Here's the adjustments we've made from what we learned and here's where we're going forward.

2313
02:16:10.74 --> 02:16:13.10
Are you good with that?

2314
02:16:13.10 --> 02:16:18.18
You have an omg just saying it was, I can't.

2315
02:16:18.18 --> 02:16:20.10
Two be specific.

2316
02:16:20.10 --> 02:16:21.78
Keep to concrete issues.

2317
02:16:21.78 --> 02:16:23.26
Say what?

2318
02:16:23.26 --> 02:16:26.82
Three limit the issue.

2319
02:16:26.82 --> 02:16:31.22
Don't blame the brass hats or the men in general.

2320
02:16:31.22 --> 02:16:32.22
Say who that's a good one.

2321
02:16:32.22 --> 02:16:34.86
A lot of the time we were just like to blame them.

2322
02:16:34.86 --> 02:16:38.46
They did it.

2323
02:16:38.46 --> 02:16:45.14
To just practical solutions to problems don't arouse emotion without suggesting what to

2324
02:16:45.14 --> 02:16:46.14
do about it.

2325
02:16:46.14 --> 02:16:47.46
Say how?

2326
02:16:47.46 --> 02:16:49.50
Five stick to facts.

2327
02:16:49.50 --> 02:16:56.66
Don't swallow rumors, especially accidents by our rumors.

2328
02:16:56.66 --> 02:17:03.42
Six criticized leaders or men for their acts and policies, not for their personalities.

2329
02:17:03.42 --> 02:17:06.78
Seven put blame where it belongs.

2330
02:17:06.78 --> 02:17:09.78
I don't find scapegoats.

2331
02:17:09.78 --> 02:17:12.78
I was going to ask, why is it?

2332
02:17:12.78 --> 02:17:20.22
I wonder why it's so like appealing for like a better term to blame other people.

2333
02:17:20.22 --> 02:17:26.22
I mean I guess when you think about it it feels like if I don't have to blame myself

2334
02:17:26.22 --> 02:17:27.22
that's a safety thing.

2335
02:17:27.22 --> 02:17:32.38
We'll start there and then sure someone will blame other things that are not people.

2336
02:17:32.38 --> 02:17:39.02
Like I don't know the weather or whatever but it's almost like it seems more satisfying

2337
02:17:39.02 --> 02:17:41.02
to blame other people.

2338
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:43.26
I don't know maybe because they don't.

2339
02:17:43.26 --> 02:17:46.10
It feels satisfying because it takes the blame off of you.

2340
02:17:46.10 --> 02:17:54.22
Even more than blaming the weather whether it's almost like it's more satisfying because

2341
02:17:54.22 --> 02:17:59.22
if I can blame someone else because someone else has the capability of actively trying

2342
02:17:59.22 --> 02:18:01.66
to get in the way of my success.

2343
02:18:01.66 --> 02:18:03.66
It's almost like this is what it feels like.

2344
02:18:03.66 --> 02:18:05.66
I think I'm just wondering.

2345
02:18:05.66 --> 02:18:10.22
I don't feel good about blaming anything or anybody or anyone.

2346
02:18:10.22 --> 02:18:16.78
Yeah because you're really in touch with that part of things.

2347
02:18:16.78 --> 02:18:20.10
I'm just saying by nature because it has to be a natural thing.

2348
02:18:20.10 --> 02:18:23.58
It has to be like a natural reaction to something I would think.

2349
02:18:23.58 --> 02:18:25.22
In different people have it worth another thing.

2350
02:18:25.22 --> 02:18:30.06
I would say that's a reaction that's not too natural and it's a reaction that you have

2351
02:18:30.06 --> 02:18:37.54
to nourish and raise correctly in yourself because when a little kid spells the

2352
02:18:37.54 --> 02:18:38.54
milk.

2353
02:18:38.54 --> 02:18:42.74
When you walk into the kitchen and your daughter sitting there in the milk is spilled

2354
02:18:42.74 --> 02:18:46.46
over she says, you say what happened?

2355
02:18:46.46 --> 02:18:49.14
She says the milk spilled.

2356
02:18:49.14 --> 02:18:51.30
She's blaming the milk and anandement object.

2357
02:18:51.30 --> 02:18:52.30
Right.

2358
02:18:52.30 --> 02:18:53.58
Already and she's four years old.

2359
02:18:53.58 --> 02:18:54.58
Five years old.

2360
02:18:54.58 --> 02:18:56.98
Right.

2361
02:18:56.98 --> 02:18:57.98
I'm the same way.

2362
02:18:57.98 --> 02:18:59.98
Everyone starts off that way.

2363
02:18:59.98 --> 02:19:03.70
Blow to our ego to take the blame for things.

2364
02:19:03.70 --> 02:19:05.50
We don't like to do it.

2365
02:19:05.50 --> 02:19:10.22
So it's not like it's something you have to mature into.

2366
02:19:10.22 --> 02:19:14.78
It's something you have to figure out over time and the more you figure it out, the better

2367
02:19:14.78 --> 02:19:16.06
off you're going to be.

2368
02:19:16.06 --> 02:19:18.62
I was talking with Dave Burke about this.

2369
02:19:18.62 --> 02:19:21.22
Good deal, Dave.

2370
02:19:21.22 --> 02:19:29.06
He was really fired up one day and the fire was coming.

2371
02:19:29.06 --> 02:19:33.30
And I forget even what you know how we got on this topic.

2372
02:19:33.30 --> 02:19:38.50
Actually, I do think we were talking about a client that we have at echelon front and he

2373
02:19:38.50 --> 02:19:45.26
was trying to explain to them that everything like trying to explain to the boss, the

2374
02:19:45.26 --> 02:19:52.42
CEO, everything, everything is your fault, everything.

2375
02:19:52.42 --> 02:19:55.06
And I got to, no, no, I get it.

2376
02:19:55.06 --> 02:19:57.06
But yeah.

2377
02:19:57.06 --> 02:19:58.46
No, no, no, no.

2378
02:19:58.46 --> 02:19:59.46
I'm all about extreme ownership.

2379
02:19:59.46 --> 02:20:00.46
I get it, man.

2380
02:20:00.46 --> 02:20:02.46
That's a great book.

2381
02:20:02.46 --> 02:20:07.86
And I'm definitely taking ownership of what's going on here.

2382
02:20:07.86 --> 02:20:16.14
But there's always a butt, but the market, but the guys that are hired, but the person

2383
02:20:16.14 --> 02:20:22.42
that I partnered with, but the person I bought the company from, but it goes on and on.

2384
02:20:22.42 --> 02:20:26.42
But the real estate that we least, it just goes on and on.

2385
02:20:26.42 --> 02:20:27.42
And guess what?

2386
02:20:27.42 --> 02:20:28.42
None of those are your problem.

2387
02:20:28.42 --> 02:20:29.42
None of those are your fault.

2388
02:20:29.42 --> 02:20:30.42
Guess what?

2389
02:20:30.42 --> 02:20:31.54
You're never going to fix any of them.

2390
02:20:31.54 --> 02:20:37.42
So the idea that this stuff is 100% your fault.

2391
02:20:37.42 --> 02:20:39.34
100% your fault.

2392
02:20:39.34 --> 02:20:41.50
That's going on in your team.

2393
02:20:41.50 --> 02:20:45.42
That's that it's hard to get that through your brain.

2394
02:20:45.42 --> 02:20:46.42
Anyone's brain.

2395
02:20:46.42 --> 02:20:48.42
Yeah, it's weird.

2396
02:20:48.42 --> 02:20:52.86
You like you ever, you know, when you're a kid or something, or whether you witnessed someone

2397
02:20:52.86 --> 02:20:55.74
else do this or you do it where it's like, let's say you lost something.

2398
02:20:55.74 --> 02:20:56.74
Right.

2399
02:20:56.74 --> 02:20:57.74
That's the first reaction.

2400
02:20:57.74 --> 02:20:58.74
Who took my, whatever.

2401
02:20:58.74 --> 02:20:59.74
What do you mean?

2402
02:20:59.74 --> 02:21:00.74
Who took it?

2403
02:21:00.74 --> 02:21:01.74
That's a seal curse.

2404
02:21:01.74 --> 02:21:06.58
So the seal curse, if you lose something, as soon as you say, hey, you took my, or hey, somebody

2405
02:21:06.58 --> 02:21:09.70
stole my, as soon as you, those words come out of your mouth, you're going to, it's going

2406
02:21:09.70 --> 02:21:10.70
to appear in front of you.

2407
02:21:10.70 --> 02:21:14.38
You can actually do it like to find something to evolve.

2408
02:21:14.38 --> 02:21:15.38
Excuse me, I'm so funny.

2409
02:21:15.38 --> 02:21:16.38
I'm going to do this.

2410
02:21:16.38 --> 02:21:17.38
I'm going to find an immediate, yeah.

2411
02:21:17.38 --> 02:21:21.54
That's probably my earliest memory in the seal teams of, don't blame people.

2412
02:21:21.54 --> 02:21:22.54
Is that right there?

2413
02:21:22.54 --> 02:21:26.78
Because if you, you can't find your, second mark life jacket, whatever.

2414
02:21:26.78 --> 02:21:27.78
Yeah.

2415
02:21:27.78 --> 02:21:29.30
So when you took my second mark, oh, there it is.

2416
02:21:29.30 --> 02:21:30.30
It's a willing stencil.

2417
02:21:30.30 --> 02:21:32.90
The JKO stencils on that one over there.

2418
02:21:32.90 --> 02:21:34.30
It was underneath another one.

2419
02:21:34.30 --> 02:21:35.30
Yeah.

2420
02:21:35.30 --> 02:21:36.86
But yes, that's something that we all do.

2421
02:21:36.86 --> 02:21:39.14
But it's like a natural thing to think, be good.

2422
02:21:39.14 --> 02:21:40.14
Okay.

2423
02:21:40.14 --> 02:21:43.50
So I have these, these slippers at home.

2424
02:21:43.50 --> 02:21:44.86
Do you mean flip flops?

2425
02:21:44.86 --> 02:21:45.86
No.

2426
02:21:45.86 --> 02:21:46.86
That's the thing.

2427
02:21:46.86 --> 02:21:47.86
They're, they're nice.

2428
02:21:47.86 --> 02:21:48.86
Because no way we call flip flops.

2429
02:21:48.86 --> 02:21:49.86
Flip flops.

2430
02:21:49.86 --> 02:21:50.86
Yes, exactly.

2431
02:21:50.86 --> 02:21:51.86
But these are slippers.

2432
02:21:51.86 --> 02:21:55.86
Just flying in and out of like when you're walking and whatever.

2433
02:21:55.86 --> 02:22:01.62
And so flip flops, like if you, let's say you're wearing flip flops or fangs, flip flops, right?

2434
02:22:01.62 --> 02:22:03.86
That's flip flops or.

2435
02:22:03.86 --> 02:22:04.86
So they're not that.

2436
02:22:04.86 --> 02:22:08.86
Because if you're wearing socks, which I have been recently, because it's kind of chilly.

2437
02:22:08.86 --> 02:22:11.46
But it's all wear socks.

2438
02:22:11.46 --> 02:22:14.66
So you can't just slide in and out of flip flops with socks on.

2439
02:22:14.66 --> 02:22:17.62
Not that good, you know, if I'm going to take out the trash or something like this.

2440
02:22:17.62 --> 02:22:21.98
So anyway, I have these slippers real comfortable to their like just regular Nike, like slippers,

2441
02:22:21.98 --> 02:22:23.14
whatever.

2442
02:22:23.14 --> 02:22:30.86
So when I can't find them for a moment, you know, there's literally like six or seven

2443
02:22:30.86 --> 02:22:32.86
places that are far away from each other by the way.

2444
02:22:32.86 --> 02:22:36.70
And my house is that six out of place that they could struggle as real.

2445
02:22:36.70 --> 02:22:37.70
Yes, that goes.

2446
02:22:37.70 --> 02:22:42.54
All of my slippers are located far distance inside my own house.

2447
02:22:42.54 --> 02:22:43.54
Yeah.

2448
02:22:43.54 --> 02:22:44.54
They're really far apart.

2449
02:22:44.54 --> 02:22:45.54
Okay.

2450
02:22:45.54 --> 02:22:48.30
I look in what place number one, they're not there.

2451
02:22:48.30 --> 02:22:50.06
Place number two, they're not there.

2452
02:22:50.06 --> 02:22:54.46
I automatically go my wife took wearing my slippers.

2453
02:22:54.46 --> 02:22:57.54
For someone grabbed my slippers, you know, that's like the thing.

2454
02:22:57.54 --> 02:23:02.02
Even more so than the, you know, the four, five other places that I could easily, you know,

2455
02:23:02.02 --> 02:23:04.42
so I think that's why I think it's a natural thing.

2456
02:23:04.42 --> 02:23:05.42
It is a natural thing.

2457
02:23:05.42 --> 02:23:06.78
Yes, you are correct.

2458
02:23:06.78 --> 02:23:11.10
I've been saying that for the whole time, you and I have been doing this podcast.

2459
02:23:11.10 --> 02:23:13.42
It's a natural thing to blame someone else.

2460
02:23:13.42 --> 02:23:14.42
Yeah.

2461
02:23:14.42 --> 02:23:18.14
This idea of extreme ownership of actually taking ownership of problems that you have

2462
02:23:18.14 --> 02:23:19.14
is very important.

2463
02:23:19.14 --> 02:23:20.14
Yeah.

2464
02:23:20.14 --> 02:23:21.90
And it's hard to enact.

2465
02:23:21.90 --> 02:23:23.30
It's not, it's not comfortable.

2466
02:23:23.30 --> 02:23:24.30
Yeah.

2467
02:23:24.30 --> 02:23:25.30
There's no one.

2468
02:23:25.30 --> 02:23:29.02
And even when people eat the book and they listen to everybody podcast and they talk about

2469
02:23:29.02 --> 02:23:35.94
it with their troops, even then it's very easy to slide into an excuse and you blame

2470
02:23:35.94 --> 02:23:37.86
someone or something else.

2471
02:23:37.86 --> 02:23:41.94
And the problem with those excuses are they don't ever solve themselves.

2472
02:23:41.94 --> 02:23:43.54
They don't fix themselves.

2473
02:23:43.54 --> 02:23:45.34
You can control you.

2474
02:23:45.34 --> 02:23:48.54
So take control over everything.

2475
02:23:48.54 --> 02:23:55.22
Take ownership of everything so that you can make them the way that they should be.

2476
02:23:55.22 --> 02:23:56.70
What's the dichotomy in this?

2477
02:23:56.70 --> 02:23:57.98
That's why we wrote dichotomy leadership.

2478
02:23:57.98 --> 02:24:00.94
Some people took that and said, okay, well, I'm just going to do everything myself.

2479
02:24:00.94 --> 02:24:01.94
Yeah.

2480
02:24:01.94 --> 02:24:04.38
I'm just, oh, John, I was going to hold everything.

2481
02:24:04.38 --> 02:24:08.54
So now I'm going to, you know what, echo, send me a script for the video you're making

2482
02:24:08.54 --> 02:24:09.54
right now.

2483
02:24:09.54 --> 02:24:10.54
I want to review it.

2484
02:24:10.54 --> 02:24:11.54
Right?

2485
02:24:11.54 --> 02:24:14.54
I'm going to call when you like draw the pictures send me up.

2486
02:24:14.54 --> 02:24:17.66
Storyboard for your next video.

2487
02:24:17.66 --> 02:24:18.66
Ownership.

2488
02:24:18.66 --> 02:24:20.30
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

2489
02:24:20.30 --> 02:24:21.90
There's a balance.

2490
02:24:21.90 --> 02:24:22.90
Yeah.

2491
02:24:22.90 --> 02:24:23.90
So there's a question.

2492
02:24:23.90 --> 02:24:24.90
Keep it.

2493
02:24:24.90 --> 02:24:27.18
You have to keep it balance.

2494
02:24:27.18 --> 02:24:29.70
So this question, right now, not really care about the answer.

2495
02:24:29.70 --> 02:24:33.98
So is it easier to blame another person or just something else?

2496
02:24:33.98 --> 02:24:34.98
Like something else.

2497
02:24:34.98 --> 02:24:35.98
Something else.

2498
02:24:35.98 --> 02:24:36.98
Okay, this is a original point.

2499
02:24:36.98 --> 02:24:37.98
Yeah.

2500
02:24:37.98 --> 02:24:38.98
And to me, it's the point is no matter.

2501
02:24:38.98 --> 02:24:41.86
I feel equally horrible.

2502
02:24:41.86 --> 02:24:44.78
I actually feel more horrible blaming another person.

2503
02:24:44.78 --> 02:24:46.18
You seem to feel better about that.

2504
02:24:46.18 --> 02:24:47.42
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2505
02:24:47.42 --> 02:24:48.42
I feel worse.

2506
02:24:48.42 --> 02:24:49.42
I feel bad.

2507
02:24:49.42 --> 02:24:50.42
I'm breath.

2508
02:24:50.42 --> 02:24:51.42
I'm with you.

2509
02:24:51.42 --> 02:24:52.42
Okay.

2510
02:24:52.42 --> 02:24:53.42
Whether you believe me or not, I'm breath.

2511
02:24:53.42 --> 02:24:56.58
Blaming like something other than yourself, it does feel really, really whack.

2512
02:24:56.58 --> 02:24:57.58
Yes.

2513
02:24:57.58 --> 02:24:58.58
Really whack.

2514
02:24:58.58 --> 02:24:59.98
But and that's kind of the rule now.

2515
02:24:59.98 --> 02:25:06.10
I think after like four to six months of like dealing with you and this stuff, it's

2516
02:25:06.10 --> 02:25:07.74
like you became like a rule.

2517
02:25:07.74 --> 02:25:10.14
Is it consciously or whatever?

2518
02:25:10.14 --> 02:25:12.58
So is it identify another people do it too?

2519
02:25:12.58 --> 02:25:13.58
Yes, fully.

2520
02:25:13.58 --> 02:25:14.58
Well, I was.

2521
02:25:14.58 --> 02:25:15.58
Yeah.

2522
02:25:15.58 --> 02:25:20.06
And you feel it in yourself even if you have the thought, like you feel it.

2523
02:25:20.06 --> 02:25:25.98
But so I was thinking wondering, and I guess it doesn't matter, right?

2524
02:25:25.98 --> 02:25:30.42
Because the rule is the rule, but is it easier to blame a person?

2525
02:25:30.42 --> 02:25:31.42
Because it's more comforting.

2526
02:25:31.42 --> 02:25:36.06
It's easier to blame a thing because then it's free.

2527
02:25:36.06 --> 02:25:37.70
There's no guilt involved.

2528
02:25:37.70 --> 02:25:38.70
Whether it was bad.

2529
02:25:38.70 --> 02:25:39.70
That's why we failed.

2530
02:25:39.70 --> 02:25:42.38
Well, the weather doesn't get mad at you because even when I'm like, hey, I go screwed

2531
02:25:42.38 --> 02:25:43.38
up and drop the ball.

2532
02:25:43.38 --> 02:25:44.38
That's why we failed.

2533
02:25:44.38 --> 02:25:45.66
You are going to be mad at you.

2534
02:25:45.66 --> 02:25:46.66
Yeah.

2535
02:25:46.66 --> 02:25:47.66
The weather's not going to be like, hey, you got a flat tire.

2536
02:25:47.66 --> 02:25:48.66
That's why I'm late.

2537
02:25:48.66 --> 02:25:49.66
You should have left earlier.

2538
02:25:49.66 --> 02:25:50.66
No, no, no, no, no.

2539
02:25:50.66 --> 02:25:51.66
You're like, that's blaming.

2540
02:25:51.66 --> 02:25:52.66
That's me taking ownership.

2541
02:25:52.66 --> 02:25:53.66
Yeah.

2542
02:25:53.66 --> 02:25:54.66
You know?

2543
02:25:54.66 --> 02:25:55.66
But it's easy.

2544
02:25:55.66 --> 02:25:57.42
But wouldn't it be more comforting to be like, hey, someone flat?

2545
02:25:57.42 --> 02:26:00.26
Like let's say you walked out to your car and your tire was flat.

2546
02:26:00.26 --> 02:26:05.02
It'd be more comforting if someone was actively trying to get in your way.

2547
02:26:05.02 --> 02:26:06.66
Because it seems more like, okay.

2548
02:26:06.66 --> 02:26:08.30
That's why I got defeated by the situation.

2549
02:26:08.30 --> 02:26:09.30
I don't have a solution.

2550
02:26:09.30 --> 02:26:10.30
I don't have an alternative.

2551
02:26:10.30 --> 02:26:13.90
I think to me, say, hey, I walked out of the other's a nail in my thing.

2552
02:26:13.90 --> 02:26:14.90
Yeah.

2553
02:26:14.90 --> 02:26:15.90
You might take that one step.

2554
02:26:15.90 --> 02:26:16.90
But somebody left a nail in my thing.

2555
02:26:16.90 --> 02:26:17.90
Yeah, I assume saying no.

2556
02:26:17.90 --> 02:26:20.14
I mean, I wouldn't, I don't think of it.

2557
02:26:20.14 --> 02:26:21.14
Maybe I wouldn't know.

2558
02:26:21.14 --> 02:26:22.14
I don't know.

2559
02:26:22.14 --> 02:26:23.14
I don't know.

2560
02:26:23.14 --> 02:26:24.14
Your sweat in this distinction.

2561
02:26:24.14 --> 02:26:25.14
Don't blame other people or other things.

2562
02:26:25.14 --> 02:26:26.14
That's what you do.

2563
02:26:26.14 --> 02:26:27.38
You don't blame other people or other things.

2564
02:26:27.38 --> 02:26:29.70
I'm reveling in the understanding.

2565
02:26:29.70 --> 02:26:30.70
Don't revel in it.

2566
02:26:30.70 --> 02:26:31.70
Just do.

2567
02:26:31.70 --> 02:26:32.70
Just a whole action.

2568
02:26:32.70 --> 02:26:33.70
Yeah, yeah.

2569
02:26:33.70 --> 02:26:34.70
You're right.

2570
02:26:34.70 --> 02:26:35.70
You're right.

2571
02:26:35.70 --> 02:26:37.50
And you know what?

2572
02:26:37.50 --> 02:26:40.58
We're going to wrap for today.

2573
02:26:40.58 --> 02:26:46.30
We haven't even covered the major, the one of the main reasons why I'm covering this

2574
02:26:46.30 --> 02:26:47.30
book.

2575
02:26:47.30 --> 02:26:48.86
We haven't even got to yet.

2576
02:26:48.86 --> 02:26:54.18
So if we haven't even gotten to it yet, I don't want to jump into it right now because

2577
02:26:54.18 --> 02:26:55.66
it's good.

2578
02:26:55.66 --> 02:26:59.22
This is a book where I'm highlighting entire pages.

2579
02:26:59.22 --> 02:27:00.22
Entire pages.

2580
02:27:00.22 --> 02:27:05.62
I'm just, so I want to have time to discuss this properly.

2581
02:27:05.62 --> 02:27:10.50
We will not have time to discuss the rest of this properly today.

2582
02:27:10.50 --> 02:27:16.30
So one thing we do have hopefully time to discuss properly.

2583
02:27:16.30 --> 02:27:21.62
It's questionable because I know someone said the other day, I said on the podcast,

2584
02:27:21.62 --> 02:27:24.78
A, all we need to do is just wrap this up.

2585
02:27:24.78 --> 02:27:27.30
And they looked at their podcast, the player.

2586
02:27:27.30 --> 02:27:31.10
And there was 47 minutes left.

2587
02:27:31.10 --> 02:27:32.82
So it took you 47 minutes.

2588
02:27:32.82 --> 02:27:33.82
I'm blaming you.

2589
02:27:33.82 --> 02:27:34.82
I know.

2590
02:27:34.82 --> 02:27:35.82
I know.

2591
02:27:35.82 --> 02:27:44.22
I know I am at least partially guilty for lengthy sections of the podcast because what

2592
02:27:44.22 --> 02:27:48.58
I can't refrain from doing is making a little comment that spurns you to talk about Hawaii

2593
02:27:48.58 --> 02:27:49.58
5O.

2594
02:27:49.58 --> 02:27:50.58
Sure.

2595
02:27:50.58 --> 02:27:51.58
Other important topics.

2596
02:27:51.58 --> 02:28:03.78
So we'll continue with this book next week right now if you, if you want to compete.

2597
02:28:03.78 --> 02:28:04.78
Sure.

2598
02:28:04.78 --> 02:28:13.06
In life, look, I'm not saying you got to look at life as one big competition, win or lose.

2599
02:28:13.06 --> 02:28:16.46
But I'm saying you should at least consider that that's kind of happening whether you

2600
02:28:16.46 --> 02:28:18.54
want it to be happening or not.

2601
02:28:18.54 --> 02:28:32.42
In that view, you want to get on a path of victory, a path of discipline, a path of winning.

2602
02:28:32.42 --> 02:28:36.66
And I know you have some things that might help us in there.

2603
02:28:36.66 --> 02:28:37.66
Yes, sir.

2604
02:28:37.66 --> 02:28:38.66
Echo Charles.

2605
02:28:38.66 --> 02:28:42.54
So it is one of these, so if you like the way you live your life, right?

2606
02:28:42.54 --> 02:28:46.30
You're, it's like you're preparing for a battle metaphorically or whatever.

2607
02:28:46.30 --> 02:28:47.30
Right.

2608
02:28:47.30 --> 02:28:53.90
So sure, you're not competing with me or with whatever in every single little thing.

2609
02:28:53.90 --> 02:28:54.90
Right.

2610
02:28:54.90 --> 02:28:57.42
In fact, you're a big part of what you do is collaborate with me.

2611
02:28:57.42 --> 02:28:58.42
True.

2612
02:28:58.42 --> 02:28:59.42
Good.

2613
02:28:59.42 --> 02:29:02.86
But it's a weekend win, so we can win exactly right.

2614
02:29:02.86 --> 02:29:07.70
And in addition to that, if you wake up just one moment and you're in the company,

2615
02:29:07.70 --> 02:29:15.74
the heated competition of whatever, you're going to be more prepared to win.

2616
02:29:15.74 --> 02:29:16.74
Yes, sir.

2617
02:29:16.74 --> 02:29:22.10
If you put yourself in stressful situations, you'll be more prepared when the real

2618
02:29:22.10 --> 02:29:23.10
stress comes.

2619
02:29:23.10 --> 02:29:24.10
Oh, yeah.

2620
02:29:24.10 --> 02:29:25.10
Yeah.

2621
02:29:25.10 --> 02:29:28.10
So let's say, you get to, for example, right?

2622
02:29:28.10 --> 02:29:30.26
Stress situation, you can put yourself right into.

2623
02:29:30.26 --> 02:29:31.26
Yeah.

2624
02:29:31.26 --> 02:29:33.10
So let's daily base and think about this too.

2625
02:29:33.10 --> 02:29:36.90
And where, you know, the whole collaboration competition balance goes,

2626
02:29:36.90 --> 02:29:42.34
give me and you, we're competing in you too with each other when we train, right?

2627
02:29:42.34 --> 02:29:48.86
Or end we're competing with ourselves because you're using me to just get better in general.

2628
02:29:48.86 --> 02:29:52.78
So sure, there's a part of it that's like you're trying to defeat me, whatever.

2629
02:29:52.78 --> 02:29:59.18
But the main part is you're trying to defeat, you know, the gut yourself, you know,

2630
02:29:59.18 --> 02:30:00.74
a month ago or a day ago, whatever.

2631
02:30:00.74 --> 02:30:02.66
Yes, trying to get better.

2632
02:30:02.66 --> 02:30:07.30
And to do that, you have to collaborate with me who's going to provide that stress.

2633
02:30:07.30 --> 02:30:08.30
Yeah.

2634
02:30:08.30 --> 02:30:09.30
On you.

2635
02:30:09.30 --> 02:30:13.30
See, so it's always like, I think there's always an overarching competition.

2636
02:30:13.30 --> 02:30:15.34
That's what's called the life game.

2637
02:30:15.34 --> 02:30:16.34
Yeah.

2638
02:30:16.34 --> 02:30:17.34
Exactly.

2639
02:30:17.34 --> 02:30:18.34
Yeah.

2640
02:30:18.34 --> 02:30:20.34
With varying levels of, oh come on.

2641
02:30:20.34 --> 02:30:22.06
Lots of little competitions along the way.

2642
02:30:22.06 --> 02:30:23.06
Some of them are important.

2643
02:30:23.06 --> 02:30:24.90
Some of them are some you've got a surrender.

2644
02:30:24.90 --> 02:30:25.90
Yeah.

2645
02:30:25.90 --> 02:30:29.50
Because it's going to propel you further in the long game.

2646
02:30:29.50 --> 02:30:34.18
Some of them will feel like they should be a competition when they should be a collaboration.

2647
02:30:34.18 --> 02:30:35.18
This should be.

2648
02:30:35.18 --> 02:30:36.18
Okay.

2649
02:30:36.18 --> 02:30:38.18
Anyway, back to you, too.

2650
02:30:38.18 --> 02:30:39.18
Okay.

2651
02:30:39.18 --> 02:30:40.18
Just to.

2652
02:30:40.18 --> 02:30:41.18
We're doing, we're all doing, you did, too.

2653
02:30:41.18 --> 02:30:43.42
If you're not, then just, you have to.

2654
02:30:43.42 --> 02:30:44.42
Yes.

2655
02:30:44.42 --> 02:30:48.26
Essentially, have to to know the path, probably.

2656
02:30:48.26 --> 02:30:52.02
One thing that's good about you, too, is,

2657
02:30:52.02 --> 02:30:57.66
it is also, I talked about combat and war being a revealer.

2658
02:30:57.66 --> 02:30:59.06
Judges is revealing, too.

2659
02:30:59.06 --> 02:31:01.98
It feels about things about yourself.

2660
02:31:01.98 --> 02:31:03.42
It reveals things about human nature.

2661
02:31:03.42 --> 02:31:05.98
It reveals things about your ego.

2662
02:31:05.98 --> 02:31:07.86
It reveals things about your temper.

2663
02:31:07.86 --> 02:31:09.66
It reveals a lot of things.

2664
02:31:09.66 --> 02:31:11.26
And it reveals those things about other people.

2665
02:31:11.26 --> 02:31:15.46
And you start to be able to sense and understand other people better because you see

2666
02:31:15.46 --> 02:31:20.94
their reactions, you see how they respond, you see how they get through or don't get through

2667
02:31:20.94 --> 02:31:22.82
trying situations.

2668
02:31:22.82 --> 02:31:23.82
Yeah.

2669
02:31:23.82 --> 02:31:24.82
It's really.

2670
02:31:24.82 --> 02:31:26.54
And so there's some really good benefits.

2671
02:31:26.54 --> 02:31:32.66
Beyond the fact that you will get a good workout, beyond the fact that you will truly

2672
02:31:32.66 --> 02:31:39.30
learn to defend yourself in bad situations, you will also learn about life.

2673
02:31:39.30 --> 02:31:40.30
Yes.

2674
02:31:40.30 --> 02:31:41.70
You will learn about people.

2675
02:31:41.70 --> 02:31:44.94
And you will learn about yourself.

2676
02:31:44.94 --> 02:31:45.94
Yes, sir.

2677
02:31:45.94 --> 02:31:49.70
So go down to your local Judges to Academy and tell me you want to train some of the

2678
02:31:49.70 --> 02:31:51.70
Judges to that's kind of abstract.

2679
02:31:51.70 --> 02:31:53.70
The way you said what's true.

2680
02:31:53.70 --> 02:31:56.70
You know, you'll learn about life, not abstract, sorry.

2681
02:31:56.70 --> 02:31:57.70
It's not a joke.

2682
02:31:57.70 --> 02:31:58.70
No, no, no.

2683
02:31:58.70 --> 02:31:59.70
Yeah, you're right.

2684
02:31:59.70 --> 02:32:00.70
It's general though.

2685
02:32:00.70 --> 02:32:01.70
Here's something specific.

2686
02:32:01.70 --> 02:32:07.42
What if I told you, I've learned more about life and people and myself from

2687
02:32:07.42 --> 02:32:11.70
Judges who that I have learned about self defense from Judges who.

2688
02:32:11.70 --> 02:32:12.70
Yeah, in that whole state.

2689
02:32:12.70 --> 02:32:14.70
I don't know what that would be like.

2690
02:32:14.70 --> 02:32:15.70
But I'm not.

2691
02:32:15.70 --> 02:32:16.70
I'm not.

2692
02:32:16.70 --> 02:32:18.70
Because I don't think I've learned a lot.

2693
02:32:18.70 --> 02:32:21.70
But I've learned so much about actually fighting.

2694
02:32:21.70 --> 02:32:22.70
Yes.

2695
02:32:22.70 --> 02:32:24.70
So that's kind of a what I just said.

2696
02:32:24.70 --> 02:32:25.70
Not really.

2697
02:32:25.70 --> 02:32:27.70
Could be for others though.

2698
02:32:27.70 --> 02:32:28.70
There's a lot.

2699
02:32:28.70 --> 02:32:29.70
Yeah, but I don't want to exaggerate.

2700
02:32:29.70 --> 02:32:30.70
Well, he and lie.

2701
02:32:30.70 --> 02:32:35.70
Well, here's why we said well, here's why I started and whether I mean, I think you started

2702
02:32:35.70 --> 02:32:36.70
before this event.

2703
02:32:36.70 --> 02:32:37.70
So, okay.

2704
02:32:37.70 --> 02:32:41.70
So there's there is this family.

2705
02:32:41.70 --> 02:32:44.70
They said, hey, we developed this martial art, you know, whatever.

2706
02:32:44.70 --> 02:32:46.70
Is there a reason you're not saying the Gracie family?

2707
02:32:46.70 --> 02:32:49.70
Yeah, well, it's going to develop it in a story.

2708
02:32:49.70 --> 02:32:52.70
But yes, so the Gracie family, they developed their martial art.

2709
02:32:52.70 --> 02:32:54.70
They were like, hey, this is our fighting style.

2710
02:32:54.70 --> 02:32:55.70
A real fighting now.

2711
02:32:55.70 --> 02:32:56.70
So let's this is what we're going to do.

2712
02:32:56.70 --> 02:33:00.70
We're going to invite everyone from the all around the world with whatever fighting style

2713
02:33:00.70 --> 02:33:03.70
no matter how big no matter how small the guy is, whatever fighting style.

2714
02:33:03.70 --> 02:33:06.70
We're going to invite everybody to come come like fight.

2715
02:33:06.70 --> 02:33:07.70
No time limit.

2716
02:33:07.70 --> 02:33:08.70
No rules.

2717
02:33:08.70 --> 02:33:09.70
No nothing.

2718
02:33:09.70 --> 02:33:10.70
Everyone's going to fight.

2719
02:33:10.70 --> 02:33:11.70
See who's fighting style.

2720
02:33:11.70 --> 02:33:12.70
This is the best.

2721
02:33:12.70 --> 02:33:12.70
Right?

2722
02:33:12.70 --> 02:33:14.70
Sounds like an old school like movie or something.

2723
02:33:14.70 --> 02:33:15.70
Yeah.

2724
02:33:15.70 --> 02:33:16.70
That's true.

2725
02:33:16.70 --> 02:33:17.70
Straight up happened.

2726
02:33:17.70 --> 02:33:18.70
I mean, 1993.

2727
02:33:18.70 --> 02:33:19.70
Right.

2728
02:33:19.70 --> 02:33:20.70
Yeah.

2729
02:33:20.70 --> 02:33:21.70
Colorado.

2730
02:33:21.70 --> 02:33:24.70
So they come and.

2731
02:33:24.70 --> 02:33:26.70
Hoist Gracie, who's 165 pounds.

2732
02:33:26.70 --> 02:33:27.70
No, he's not 165 pounds.

2733
02:33:27.70 --> 02:33:28.70
He's not 165 pounds.

2734
02:33:28.70 --> 02:33:29.70
At the time, he's one five.

2735
02:33:29.70 --> 02:33:31.70
I don't think so.

2736
02:33:31.70 --> 02:33:34.70
I think he was like one, 62 or three actually.

2737
02:33:34.70 --> 02:33:35.70
What's with hoist?

2738
02:33:35.70 --> 02:33:36.70
Yeah.

2739
02:33:36.70 --> 02:33:38.70
You see, one, two, three, one, two, four.

2740
02:33:38.70 --> 02:33:40.70
If you rolled with hoist before, no.

2741
02:33:40.70 --> 02:33:41.70
He's not small bro.

2742
02:33:41.70 --> 02:33:42.70
Yeah, he's tall.

2743
02:33:42.70 --> 02:33:43.70
He's tall.

2744
02:33:43.70 --> 02:33:44.70
But he's thinner.

2745
02:33:44.70 --> 02:33:45.70
He's thinner.

2746
02:33:45.70 --> 02:33:47.70
But he's not like skinny.

2747
02:33:47.70 --> 02:33:49.70
And he wasn't skinny back then.

2748
02:33:49.70 --> 02:33:51.70
He must have waited at least 180.

2749
02:33:51.70 --> 02:33:52.70
I'm going to give him 180.

2750
02:33:52.70 --> 02:33:54.70
What we'll talk to hoist and get confirmation.

2751
02:33:54.70 --> 02:33:55.70
We'll talk to some of our people.

2752
02:33:55.70 --> 02:33:56.70
I think one, 60.

2753
02:33:56.70 --> 02:33:57.70
Yeah.

2754
02:33:57.70 --> 02:34:00.70
Anyway, if he was 160, I would have to check the scales.

2755
02:34:00.70 --> 02:34:01.70
Yeah.

2756
02:34:01.70 --> 02:34:02.70
Well, none of the last.

2757
02:34:02.70 --> 02:34:06.70
Now, have you ever heard that they reasoned hoist was fighting and not Hickson is because

2758
02:34:06.70 --> 02:34:11.70
Hoist was smaller and slender and looked less imposing.

2759
02:34:11.70 --> 02:34:12.70
Yeah.

2760
02:34:12.70 --> 02:34:13.70
Didn't Hickson.

2761
02:34:13.70 --> 02:34:13.70
Yeah.

2762
02:34:13.70 --> 02:34:14.70
Who did look imposing?

2763
02:34:14.70 --> 02:34:15.70
Right.

2764
02:34:15.70 --> 02:34:15.70
Yeah.

2765
02:34:15.70 --> 02:34:18.70
And that was kind of an added look for imposing.

2766
02:34:18.70 --> 02:34:19.70
Who looked more imposing?

2767
02:34:19.70 --> 02:34:21.70
Hickson Gracie or Ken Shamrock.

2768
02:34:21.70 --> 02:34:22.70
Ken Shamrock.

2769
02:34:22.70 --> 02:34:24.70
Ken Shamrock looked real imposing.

2770
02:34:24.70 --> 02:34:25.70
Oh, yeah.

2771
02:34:25.70 --> 02:34:31.70
That's why it was so shocking when hoist had 160 pounds apparently tapped him out.

2772
02:34:31.70 --> 02:34:32.70
Yeah.

2773
02:34:32.70 --> 02:34:34.70
So the story, the facts go.

2774
02:34:34.70 --> 02:34:35.70
This is what happened.

2775
02:34:35.70 --> 02:34:37.70
You can watch them on the old videos.

2776
02:34:37.70 --> 02:34:39.70
So they called it the ultimate fighting challenge.

2777
02:34:39.70 --> 02:34:40.70
It's what they called it.

2778
02:34:40.70 --> 02:34:41.70
The UFC.

2779
02:34:41.70 --> 02:34:42.70
Sure.

2780
02:34:42.70 --> 02:34:45.70
So hoist Gracie spriesingly beats up everyone.

2781
02:34:45.70 --> 02:34:48.70
This wasn't the kind of like you have one fight in one night.

2782
02:34:48.70 --> 02:34:49.70
No, no.

2783
02:34:49.70 --> 02:34:50.70
This is like four fights in a row.

2784
02:34:50.70 --> 02:34:51.70
If you win, you go on.

2785
02:34:51.70 --> 02:34:53.70
You know, no time limit, by the way.

2786
02:34:53.70 --> 02:34:55.70
Four contact fighting.

2787
02:34:55.70 --> 02:34:56.70
Headbutt.

2788
02:34:56.70 --> 02:34:58.70
Like whatever.

2789
02:34:58.70 --> 02:34:59.70
Yeah.

2790
02:34:59.70 --> 02:35:00.70
Kicking the groin, whatever.

2791
02:35:00.70 --> 02:35:01.70
Anyway.

2792
02:35:01.70 --> 02:35:05.70
Hoist Gracie beats everybody including Ken Shamrock who's like, well, he was like 220.

2793
02:35:05.70 --> 02:35:06.70
He was a rich kid.

2794
02:35:06.70 --> 02:35:07.70
Right.

2795
02:35:07.70 --> 02:35:08.70
Shoot fighting wrestling.

2796
02:35:08.70 --> 02:35:09.70
Like just a bad ask.

2797
02:35:09.70 --> 02:35:10.70
I went for a fuck.

2798
02:35:10.70 --> 02:35:11.70
He went for a fuck.

2799
02:35:11.70 --> 02:35:13.70
When she's crazy, he's got on top.

2800
02:35:13.70 --> 02:35:14.70
Yeah.

2801
02:35:14.70 --> 02:35:15.70
And Hoist knew to defend it.

2802
02:35:15.70 --> 02:35:16.70
That's even crazier.

2803
02:35:16.70 --> 02:35:19.70
You know, go out and talk and choke them up.

2804
02:35:19.70 --> 02:35:22.70
And then guys like who I don't think people talking about this guy.

2805
02:35:22.70 --> 02:35:23.70
Pat Smith.

2806
02:35:23.70 --> 02:35:24.70
Pat Smith is a beast.

2807
02:35:24.70 --> 02:35:27.70
They're not cool kickboxing champions.

2808
02:35:27.70 --> 02:35:28.70
Like 250 and no.

2809
02:35:28.70 --> 02:35:30.70
That's what it said on the video.

2810
02:35:30.70 --> 02:35:32.70
Um, bad just a tough bad ask.

2811
02:35:32.70 --> 02:35:35.70
Because you was beating guys up real bad.

2812
02:35:35.70 --> 02:35:38.70
In fact, he beat this ninja guy up on UFC 2.

2813
02:35:38.70 --> 02:35:39.70
Yeah.

2814
02:35:39.70 --> 02:35:41.70
That was like as a kid, watch out.

2815
02:35:41.70 --> 02:35:43.70
I was like dang, that's like, this is brutal man.

2816
02:35:43.70 --> 02:35:45.70
This is like scary brutal.

2817
02:35:45.70 --> 02:35:47.70
And nowadays that's nothing.

2818
02:35:47.70 --> 02:35:48.70
You know, you watch UFC now.

2819
02:35:48.70 --> 02:35:50.70
But nonetheless it was brutal then.

2820
02:35:50.70 --> 02:35:52.70
And Hoist Gracie beat him up.

2821
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:53.70
And Hoist Gracie beat him up.

2822
02:35:53.70 --> 02:35:56.70
He didn't do a submission hold on him.

2823
02:35:56.70 --> 02:35:58.70
He just had him in Mount.

2824
02:35:58.70 --> 02:35:59.70
Oh yeah.

2825
02:35:59.70 --> 02:36:00.70
And just punching him down.

2826
02:36:00.70 --> 02:36:01.70
He just tried to do this.

2827
02:36:01.70 --> 02:36:01.70
You know.

2828
02:36:01.70 --> 02:36:04.70
Anyway, so the point is, Hoist Gracie with Gracie Jiu Jitsu,

2829
02:36:04.70 --> 02:36:05.70
which is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

2830
02:36:05.70 --> 02:36:06.70
It's an exchange of hold.

2831
02:36:06.70 --> 02:36:09.70
And beat up everyone.

2832
02:36:09.70 --> 02:36:12.70
Proving that it's like the ultimate fighting style.

2833
02:36:12.70 --> 02:36:13.70
Yeah.

2834
02:36:13.70 --> 02:36:18.70
So that's why that's the number one reason I think most people go into Jitsu.

2835
02:36:18.70 --> 02:36:20.70
That's definitely a good reason.

2836
02:36:20.70 --> 02:36:22.70
I think well, back that I would say this.

2837
02:36:22.70 --> 02:36:26.70
That's the number one reason in 1993, 1994, 1995.

2838
02:36:26.70 --> 02:36:27.70
Why people want to Jiu Jitsu.

2839
02:36:27.70 --> 02:36:33.70
I think Jiu Jitsu now is, I think Jiu Jitsu as a whole is more popular.

2840
02:36:33.70 --> 02:36:34.70
You can get Jiu Jitsu from anywhere.

2841
02:36:34.70 --> 02:36:37.70
I mean, at wrestling tournaments, there's all kinds of kids they're walking out.

2842
02:36:37.70 --> 02:36:38.70
Jiu Jitsu, T-shirts on.

2843
02:36:38.70 --> 02:36:42.70
They didn't want to even, they weren't even, they were, they're 12 years old.

2844
02:36:42.70 --> 02:36:43.70
Yeah.

2845
02:36:43.70 --> 02:36:45.70
And now they don't remember 1993.

2846
02:36:45.70 --> 02:36:50.70
Think about something that happened whatever 20 years before you reborn.

2847
02:36:50.70 --> 02:36:53.70
So I think it was something that happened in 1957.

2848
02:36:53.70 --> 02:36:55.70
I can't think of one single thing.

2849
02:36:55.70 --> 02:36:56.70
And that's what I'm saying.

2850
02:36:56.70 --> 02:37:00.70
That's the first UFC happened to these kids 20 years before they were born.

2851
02:37:00.70 --> 02:37:01.70
Yeah.

2852
02:37:01.70 --> 02:37:02.70
They don't remember it.

2853
02:37:02.70 --> 02:37:03.70
It's not even a thing.

2854
02:37:03.70 --> 02:37:05.70
They do remember it's like, oh,

2855
02:37:05.70 --> 02:37:09.70
if someone kid down the street knows how to fight, he choked me.

2856
02:37:09.70 --> 02:37:10.70
I want to learn that.

2857
02:37:10.70 --> 02:37:13.70
Yeah. Well, if they're watching ultimate fight night,

2858
02:37:13.70 --> 02:37:16.70
last night or the other night or whatever,

2859
02:37:16.70 --> 02:37:17.70
and they saw Crongrace.

2860
02:37:17.70 --> 02:37:18.70
Yes.

2861
02:37:18.70 --> 02:37:19.70
Show got the guy in UFC.

2862
02:37:19.70 --> 02:37:20.70
Yes.

2863
02:37:20.70 --> 02:37:21.70
In the first round.

2864
02:37:21.70 --> 02:37:22.70
Yes.

2865
02:37:22.70 --> 02:37:24.70
Someone's going to join Jiu Jitsu because that anyway, that is true.

2866
02:37:24.70 --> 02:37:25.70
Yes.

2867
02:37:25.70 --> 02:37:26.70
That was true.

2868
02:37:26.70 --> 02:37:28.70
A beautiful display of Jiu Jitsu.

2869
02:37:28.70 --> 02:37:30.70
Very crong-garic from Crongracey.

2870
02:37:30.70 --> 02:37:31.70
Yeah.

2871
02:37:31.70 --> 02:37:34.70
That always feels good because it's a reminder because it's easy.

2872
02:37:34.70 --> 02:37:36.70
Like now because everyone knows Jiu Jitsu.

2873
02:37:36.70 --> 02:37:38.70
You know, very levels or whatever.

2874
02:37:38.70 --> 02:37:39.70
And you have to see.

2875
02:37:39.70 --> 02:37:41.70
But when you get a guy who's like so good at Jiu Jitsu,

2876
02:37:41.70 --> 02:37:44.70
every once in a while like he'll end him in Maya would do this too.

2877
02:37:44.70 --> 02:37:48.70
They'd remind everyone like how powerful if you're just really good at Jiu Jitsu.

2878
02:37:48.70 --> 02:37:51.70
And the other guy doesn't quite have those elements or whatever.

2879
02:37:51.70 --> 02:37:53.70
You don't remind me of that.

2880
02:37:53.70 --> 02:37:54.70
Dean Lister.

2881
02:37:54.70 --> 02:37:56.70
He reminds me of that a lot.

2882
02:37:56.70 --> 02:37:57.70
Yeah.

2883
02:37:57.70 --> 02:37:58.70
For sure.

2884
02:37:58.70 --> 02:38:00.70
Nonetheless, well, we're in Jiu Jitsu and we need to get what he do.

2885
02:38:00.70 --> 02:38:02.70
We get origin.

2886
02:38:02.70 --> 02:38:03.70
Gees.

2887
02:38:03.70 --> 02:38:04.70
Made America.

2888
02:38:04.70 --> 02:38:05.70
Yeah.

2889
02:38:05.70 --> 02:38:07.70
From the cotton all the way up to the gees.

2890
02:38:07.70 --> 02:38:08.70
Made America for Jiu Jitsu.

2891
02:38:08.70 --> 02:38:11.70
Not many other martial arts as well.

2892
02:38:11.70 --> 02:38:12.70
Just for Jiu Jitsu.

2893
02:38:12.70 --> 02:38:14.70
Specifically not Ikido.

2894
02:38:14.70 --> 02:38:16.70
They're not made for Ikido.

2895
02:38:16.70 --> 02:38:17.70
No, no.

2896
02:38:17.70 --> 02:38:18.70
4 Jiu Jitsu.

2897
02:38:18.70 --> 02:38:19.70
Made America.

2898
02:38:19.70 --> 02:38:21.70
They're they're the best gees.

2899
02:38:21.70 --> 02:38:22.70
Stretching out.

2900
02:38:22.70 --> 02:38:23.70
Get.

2901
02:38:23.70 --> 02:38:25.70
There's not even any question about that one.

2902
02:38:25.70 --> 02:38:26.70
OriginMain.com.

2903
02:38:26.70 --> 02:38:27.70
Also got rash guards.

2904
02:38:27.70 --> 02:38:31.70
Rash guards if you need rash guards for your no-gu situation.

2905
02:38:31.70 --> 02:38:33.70
They got t-shirts.

2906
02:38:33.70 --> 02:38:35.70
Sweat shirts.

2907
02:38:35.70 --> 02:38:36.70
Jeans.

2908
02:38:36.70 --> 02:38:38.70
Peach is sent me a picture.

2909
02:38:38.70 --> 02:38:39.70
Jeans coming off the rack.

2910
02:38:39.70 --> 02:38:41.70
They're in production at this time.

2911
02:38:41.70 --> 02:38:42.70
Good jeans.

2912
02:38:42.70 --> 02:38:44.70
So be ready to get jeans.

2913
02:38:44.70 --> 02:38:46.70
Also supplements.

2914
02:38:46.70 --> 02:38:47.70
Mm-hmm.

2915
02:38:47.70 --> 02:38:48.70
From origin labs.

2916
02:38:48.70 --> 02:38:50.70
That's kind of supplements.

2917
02:38:50.70 --> 02:38:52.70
Kind of maintain your joints joint warfare.

2918
02:38:52.70 --> 02:38:55.70
I sure are incurred.

2919
02:38:55.70 --> 02:38:56.70
A hip.

2920
02:38:56.70 --> 02:38:57.70
Injury.

2921
02:38:57.70 --> 02:38:58.70
Mm-hmm.

2922
02:38:58.70 --> 02:38:59.70
Yeah.

2923
02:38:59.70 --> 02:39:00.70
The other day.

2924
02:39:00.70 --> 02:39:02.70
It's really bad that night.

2925
02:39:02.70 --> 02:39:04.70
So I don't overdo.

2926
02:39:04.70 --> 02:39:06.70
Can you overdo some joint warfare?

2927
02:39:06.70 --> 02:39:07.70
I'm not sure.

2928
02:39:07.70 --> 02:39:08.70
I haven't tried.

2929
02:39:08.70 --> 02:39:09.70
So I add just one pill.

2930
02:39:09.70 --> 02:39:11.70
Usually I take, how much do you take a night?

2931
02:39:11.70 --> 02:39:12.70
Three.

2932
02:39:12.70 --> 02:39:13.70
Okay.

2933
02:39:13.70 --> 02:39:14.70
I take three in the morning for it night.

2934
02:39:14.70 --> 02:39:15.70
Okay.

2935
02:39:15.70 --> 02:39:16.70
So I went two and two.

2936
02:39:16.70 --> 02:39:17.70
Okay.

2937
02:39:17.70 --> 02:39:19.70
And I'm like, I'm just going to do this or whatever.

2938
02:39:19.70 --> 02:39:25.70
And it is the difference between night one of the injury and night two of the injury

2939
02:39:25.70 --> 02:39:27.70
was surprising given how the injury felt.

2940
02:39:27.70 --> 02:39:28.70
There you go.

2941
02:39:28.70 --> 02:39:29.70
So this is it.

2942
02:39:29.70 --> 02:39:30.70
Yes.

2943
02:39:30.70 --> 02:39:31.70
So joint warfare.

2944
02:39:31.70 --> 02:39:34.70
And these are the, now I think these are the most important kind of supplements.

2945
02:39:34.70 --> 02:39:35.70
There is.

2946
02:39:35.70 --> 02:39:36.70
I think I agree with you.

2947
02:39:36.70 --> 02:39:41.70
Joint warfare, krill oil, discipline and discipline go.

2948
02:39:41.70 --> 02:39:46.70
When you need a little bit of need to get in.

2949
02:39:46.70 --> 02:39:49.70
You need to get up on step is what we call it in the teams.

2950
02:39:49.70 --> 02:39:52.70
Well, and what that means is you're in a little zodiac boat.

2951
02:39:52.70 --> 02:39:55.70
And the zodiac boat going across the water with a 55 horsepower engine.

2952
02:39:55.70 --> 02:39:59.70
If you're out on the on the west coast on the east coast, they use a smaller engine on the west coast.

2953
02:39:59.70 --> 02:40:05.70
You use a big 55 horsepower engine because you're out in the Pacific and the waves are freaking huge.

2954
02:40:05.70 --> 02:40:12.70
But the reaches a point where kind of the, the boats like trying to push and then it gets on the,

2955
02:40:12.70 --> 02:40:15.70
it's like in the water and then it gets kind of on the surface of the water.

2956
02:40:15.70 --> 02:40:16.70
Mm-hmm.

2957
02:40:16.70 --> 02:40:17.70
In all of a sudden it goes,

2958
02:40:17.70 --> 02:40:18.70
mmm.

2959
02:40:18.70 --> 02:40:20.70
And then you're going fast.

2960
02:40:20.70 --> 02:40:21.70
You're on step.

2961
02:40:21.70 --> 02:40:22.70
Yeah.

2962
02:40:22.70 --> 02:40:23.70
Yeah.

2963
02:40:23.70 --> 02:40:24.70
Getting on step.

2964
02:40:24.70 --> 02:40:25.70
I don't know where that comes from.

2965
02:40:25.70 --> 02:40:25.70
Huh.

2966
02:40:25.70 --> 02:40:26.70
But in zodiac.

2967
02:40:26.70 --> 02:40:29.70
So it's like the perfect zone where it gets the water.

2968
02:40:29.70 --> 02:40:30.70
Catch the water.

2969
02:40:30.70 --> 02:40:31.70
But no drag.

2970
02:40:31.70 --> 02:40:32.70
Yes.

2971
02:40:32.70 --> 02:40:34.70
That's the minimum amount of drag for the boat.

2972
02:40:34.70 --> 02:40:39.70
And that's what I feel like when I take discipline go.

2973
02:40:39.70 --> 02:40:40.70
Yeah.

2974
02:40:40.70 --> 02:40:41.70
I've got to go.

2975
02:40:41.70 --> 02:40:42.70
Let's say I'm going to meet with someone.

2976
02:40:42.70 --> 02:40:46.70
I take like, you know, in a meeting, I'm going to be working with a company.

2977
02:40:46.70 --> 02:40:47.70
Takes me to this one.

2978
02:40:47.70 --> 02:40:50.70
Go get the mind firing correctly.

2979
02:40:50.70 --> 02:40:51.70
That's that.

2980
02:40:51.70 --> 02:40:52.70
Don't forget about Mok.

2981
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:54.70
Additional protein.

2982
02:40:54.70 --> 02:40:55.70
Additional protein.

2983
02:40:55.70 --> 02:40:56.70
A delicious way.

2984
02:40:56.70 --> 02:41:01.70
Well, you can call it additional protein or you can just call it dessert straight on.

2985
02:41:01.70 --> 02:41:02.70
Yes.

2986
02:41:02.70 --> 02:41:07.70
I had three scoops of Warrior Kid strawberry moke.

2987
02:41:07.70 --> 02:41:13.70
And I was just sitting there drinking it and being happy about the world.

2988
02:41:13.70 --> 02:41:14.70
Guilt, three guilt.

2989
02:41:14.70 --> 02:41:19.70
But look, can you can you can beverage make you happy to be alive?

2990
02:41:19.70 --> 02:41:19.70
Yes.

2991
02:41:19.70 --> 02:41:28.70
Warrior Kid strawberry moke can make you happy to just be in the world and just be looking

2992
02:41:28.70 --> 02:41:33.70
and be sipping on it and being and having a whole, a whole big cup.

2993
02:41:33.70 --> 02:41:38.70
And you're just every sip is you're not even, you're not even rationing yourself

2994
02:41:38.70 --> 02:41:39.70
at all.

2995
02:41:39.70 --> 02:41:41.70
It's just a way sipping.

2996
02:41:41.70 --> 02:41:47.70
Just free form just as much as you can put in your mouth like just beautiful strawberry

2997
02:41:47.70 --> 02:41:48.70
moke.

2998
02:41:48.70 --> 02:41:52.70
And I'm really getting crazy now where I'm, I'm really scatter brain.

2999
02:41:52.70 --> 02:41:54.70
I'm like peanut butter moke.

3000
02:41:54.70 --> 02:41:56.70
You can go right on the plate.

3001
02:41:56.70 --> 02:41:57.70
Yeah.

3002
02:41:57.70 --> 02:41:59.70
So anyways, that's that.

3003
02:41:59.70 --> 02:42:00.70
Very good.

3004
02:42:00.70 --> 02:42:03.70
All that stuff is at originmain.com.

3005
02:42:03.70 --> 02:42:05.70
Also, jacquoise a store.

3006
02:42:05.70 --> 02:42:07.70
It's called jacquoise store.

3007
02:42:07.70 --> 02:42:11.70
And that's where you can be on the path for sure.

3008
02:42:11.70 --> 02:42:13.70
Be on the path requirement.

3009
02:42:13.70 --> 02:42:16.70
But if you want to represent while on the path.

3010
02:42:16.70 --> 02:42:19.70
Go to jacquoise store.com, got some cool shirts on there.

3011
02:42:19.70 --> 02:42:21.70
More rash guards.

3012
02:42:21.70 --> 02:42:22.70
Yeah.

3013
02:42:22.70 --> 02:42:25.70
More representative of the paths specifically.

3014
02:42:25.70 --> 02:42:26.70
Some hoodies on there.

3015
02:42:26.70 --> 02:42:27.70
Short hats.

3016
02:42:27.70 --> 02:42:28.70
Short hats.

3017
02:42:28.70 --> 02:42:29.70
Short hats.

3018
02:42:29.70 --> 02:42:30.70
Specifically or flex fit.

3019
02:42:30.70 --> 02:42:31.70
Whatever you like, bad.

3020
02:42:31.70 --> 02:42:32.70
Both.

3021
02:42:32.70 --> 02:42:33.70
However you want to represent.

3022
02:42:33.70 --> 02:42:34.70
And here's the thing, look.

3023
02:42:34.70 --> 02:42:37.70
I don't know if I'm going to put zip up hoodies on there.

3024
02:42:37.70 --> 02:42:38.70
I don't know.

3025
02:42:38.70 --> 02:42:39.70
I think so.

3026
02:42:39.70 --> 02:42:41.70
That might not be your thing.

3027
02:42:41.70 --> 02:42:43.70
They better be so thick.

3028
02:42:43.70 --> 02:42:45.70
Maybe they'll be the whole world.

3029
02:42:45.70 --> 02:42:49.70
That the whole world that the whole world stops and says,

3030
02:42:49.70 --> 02:42:52.70
If I was in somewhere cold, I would wear that.

3031
02:42:52.70 --> 02:42:53.70
Not the whole world will say.

3032
02:42:53.70 --> 02:42:54.70
Because actually that makes sense.

3033
02:42:54.70 --> 02:42:57.70
If you go ultra thick with the zip up,

3034
02:42:57.70 --> 02:43:00.70
the reason you want zip up is because you got other clothes on.

3035
02:43:00.70 --> 02:43:02.70
Some awkward taking it on and off over head.

3036
02:43:02.70 --> 02:43:04.70
That's why you got the zip.

3037
02:43:04.70 --> 02:43:07.70
It's a real heavy duty.

3038
02:43:07.70 --> 02:43:08.70
I prefer the zip.

3039
02:43:08.70 --> 02:43:09.70
Light or heavy.

3040
02:43:09.70 --> 02:43:10.70
Yeah.

3041
02:43:10.70 --> 02:43:12.70
But you prefer the pull over as you indicate.

3042
02:43:12.70 --> 02:43:16.70
I don't want to play it.

3043
02:43:16.70 --> 02:43:19.70
Like the pull over if we're talking about medium weight.

3044
02:43:19.70 --> 02:43:21.70
But if we're going to ultra heavy weight,

3045
02:43:21.70 --> 02:43:23.70
which no one has showed me ultra heavy weight.

3046
02:43:23.70 --> 02:43:25.70
I want to see ultra heavy weight.

3047
02:43:25.70 --> 02:43:28.70
I want something that actually is a hard to pick up kind of.

3048
02:43:28.70 --> 02:43:31.70
Physically heavy.

3049
02:43:31.70 --> 02:43:36.70
Well, I think nonetheless, I think I'm going to go with some zip up stuff for

3050
02:43:36.70 --> 02:43:37.70
Jocco store.

3051
02:43:37.70 --> 02:43:38.70
That's what I think.

3052
02:43:38.70 --> 02:43:39.70
That's what I think.

3053
02:43:39.70 --> 02:43:39.70
Okay.

3054
02:43:39.70 --> 02:43:40.70
Brainstorm.

3055
02:43:40.70 --> 02:43:46.70
As you brain storm that, let me see the samples and let me talk to the producers of the fabric.

3056
02:43:46.70 --> 02:43:47.70
Okay.

3057
02:43:47.70 --> 02:43:51.70
So I can make sure that it is the heaviest and most durable and warmest fabric.

3058
02:43:51.70 --> 02:43:52.70
All right.

3059
02:43:52.70 --> 02:43:53.70
That will.

3060
02:43:53.70 --> 02:43:54.70
It's a promise.

3061
02:43:54.70 --> 02:43:54.70
All right.

3062
02:43:54.70 --> 02:43:55.70
There it is.

3063
02:43:55.70 --> 02:43:57.70
It's at joccostore.com.

3064
02:43:57.70 --> 02:43:58.70
Go in there.

3065
02:43:58.70 --> 02:43:59.70
Do you like something?

3066
02:43:59.70 --> 02:44:00.70
Get something.

3067
02:44:00.70 --> 02:44:03.70
Good way to represent while you're on the path.

3068
02:44:03.70 --> 02:44:05.70
Also, jocco like tea.

3069
02:44:05.70 --> 02:44:09.70
If you were RIT drinker or not a tea drinker,

3070
02:44:09.70 --> 02:44:13.70
still drink jocco white tea for various reasons.

3071
02:44:13.70 --> 02:44:15.70
So I gave some of this to my neighbor.

3072
02:44:15.70 --> 02:44:18.70
We're doing some things.

3073
02:44:18.70 --> 02:44:21.70
You know, and she goes, oh my gosh.

3074
02:44:21.70 --> 02:44:23.70
Yes, you know, like it was the one in the can.

3075
02:44:23.70 --> 02:44:26.70
So my wife gave her three of them.

3076
02:44:26.70 --> 02:44:29.70
And she's like, oh my gosh, thank you so much.

3077
02:44:29.70 --> 02:44:30.70
This is so good.

3078
02:44:30.70 --> 02:44:34.70
And it's so hard to find tea and a can that certified organic.

3079
02:44:34.70 --> 02:44:35.70
Yeah.

3080
02:44:35.70 --> 02:44:37.70
Like that was the front running thing for us.

3081
02:44:37.70 --> 02:44:42.70
So I'm like looking at her like understanding that she has no idea that she can like dead live

3082
02:44:42.70 --> 02:44:43.70
8,000 pounds.

3083
02:44:43.70 --> 02:44:46.70
No, or you know, like all these other added benefits.

3084
02:44:46.70 --> 02:44:52.70
But nonetheless, it really demonstrated how vast the benefits.

3085
02:44:52.70 --> 02:44:53.70
Yeah.

3086
02:44:53.70 --> 02:44:54.70
You know, and the people.

3087
02:44:54.70 --> 02:44:55.70
Yeah.

3088
02:44:55.70 --> 02:45:01.70
It's kind of a weird perspective to have on life when you when you rate certified organic

3089
02:45:01.70 --> 02:45:05.70
over a guaranteed of deadlift of 8,000 pounds.

3090
02:45:05.70 --> 02:45:08.70
And I know clinically, you know, it's crazy little bit straight.

3091
02:45:08.70 --> 02:45:14.70
But nonetheless, after, you know, a little bit of thought I understand because you know, this is nice lady lives next door.

3092
02:45:14.70 --> 02:45:16.70
And you know, I dug it either way.

3093
02:45:16.70 --> 02:45:19.70
But one of the added benefits was brought to the surface.

3094
02:45:19.70 --> 02:45:20.70
And I like this.

3095
02:45:20.70 --> 02:45:25.70
Speaking of benefits, subscribe to the podcast, which we were going to stop saying until

3096
02:45:25.70 --> 02:45:31.70
people noted that they didn't subscribe to the podcast until echo actually said it on podcast

3097
02:45:31.70 --> 02:45:37.70
64 or no 163. And so it was like, I listened to 163 podcasts and hadn't subscribed.

3098
02:45:37.70 --> 02:45:43.70
So subscribe to the podcast or echo will keep telling you to and don't forget about the war, your kid podcast,

3099
02:45:43.70 --> 02:45:47.70
lagging, lagging on the war, your kid podcast.

3100
02:45:47.70 --> 02:45:51.70
And I got told by young Alana, you know, Alana, sure.

3101
02:45:51.70 --> 02:45:53.70
I got told by Alana's dad.

3102
02:45:53.70 --> 02:45:59.70
He said he, she said, he said, she has memorized the first whatever it is.

3103
02:45:59.70 --> 02:46:01.70
21 podcast.

3104
02:46:01.70 --> 02:46:03.70
And I said, I looked at her and I said, I'm sorry.

3105
02:46:03.70 --> 02:46:05.70
I'll make more and she said it's okay.

3106
02:46:05.70 --> 02:46:07.70
But she didn't mean it.

3107
02:46:07.70 --> 02:46:08.70
I don't think she meant it.

3108
02:46:08.70 --> 02:46:10.70
And I think she was kind of like just being nice.

3109
02:46:10.70 --> 02:46:11.70
It's a nice girl.

3110
02:46:11.70 --> 02:46:14.70
I don't think she wanted to say, yeah, you should.

3111
02:46:14.70 --> 02:46:15.70
Yeah.

3112
02:46:15.70 --> 02:46:16.70
Some more podcasts.

3113
02:46:16.70 --> 02:46:16.70
Yeah.

3114
02:46:16.70 --> 02:46:18.70
The first 21 are getting worn out.

3115
02:46:18.70 --> 02:46:20.70
War your kid podcast.

3116
02:46:20.70 --> 02:46:26.70
Good podcast for kids to learn a really solid lessons about life.

3117
02:46:26.70 --> 02:46:28.70
Don't forget about the war your kid.

He's 13 years old.

3122
02:46:37.70 --> 02:46:38.70
He's got his own business.

3123
02:46:38.70 --> 02:46:39.70
He's got product moving.

3124
02:46:39.70 --> 02:46:40.70
He's shipping stuff.

3125
02:46:40.70 --> 02:46:42.70
He's got credit card.

3126
02:46:42.70 --> 02:46:43.70
What is that thing called?

3127
02:46:43.70 --> 02:46:45.70
The credit card system.

3128
02:46:45.70 --> 02:46:49.70
Oh, like the, you know, the, you know,

3129
02:46:49.70 --> 02:46:52.70

3130
02:46:52.70 --> 02:46:53.70
Got a point of sale system running.

3131
02:46:53.70 --> 02:46:56.70
Got production, got manufacturing happening.

3132
02:46:56.70 --> 02:46:57.70
Hey, it's soap.

3133
02:46:57.70 --> 02:46:59.70
Is it an iPhone?

3134
02:46:59.70 --> 02:47:00.70
No, but you know what?

3135
02:47:00.70 --> 02:47:02.70
What were you doing at 13 years old?

3136
02:47:02.70 --> 02:47:04.70
You weren't, you didn't have a manufacturing line set up.

3137
02:47:04.70 --> 02:47:05.70
I don't think.

3138
02:47:05.70 --> 02:47:09.70
So if you want to support kid a kid or your kid that's getting after it.

You.

3142

YouTube videos.

3143
02:47:18.70 --> 02:47:19.70
Yes.

3144
02:47:19.70 --> 02:47:22.70
If you like watching YouTube videos, that's not good.

3145
02:47:22.70 --> 02:47:25.70
You probably don't need to watch YouTube videos.

3146
02:47:25.70 --> 02:47:27.70
They're distracting. They take a bunch of time.

3147
02:47:27.70 --> 02:47:34.70
If you do feel the need, you might as well watch this YouTube video of this podcast.

3148
02:47:34.70 --> 02:47:41.70
Or the smaller excerpts of this podcast that are clipped out.

3149
02:47:41.70 --> 02:47:48.70
Or you can even watch Echo's legit videos, which are videos that echo his

02:47:48.70 --> 02:47:53.70
modified with CGI straight up straight up CG.

3151

It's a generated generated.

3152
02:47:55.70 --> 02:47:57.70
Computer generated graphics.

3153
02:47:57.70 --> 02:47:59.70
That's what Echo's good at.

3154
02:47:59.70 --> 02:48:01.70
That's his thing.

3155
02:48:01.70 --> 02:48:02.70
Sure.

3156
02:48:02.70 --> 02:48:04.70
He's good at that and he's good at curls.

3157
02:48:04.70 --> 02:48:08.70
Well, he's not as good as I was before.

3158
02:48:08.70 --> 02:48:09.70
Yeah.

Don't forget about that.

3162
02:48:17.70 --> 02:48:22.70
Echo is just showing me a funny thing on the Graham.

3163
02:48:22.70 --> 02:48:27.70
The Graham of a girl that was lip syncing a psychological warfare video.

3164
02:48:27.70 --> 02:48:29.70
And we have to say it was awesome.

3165
02:48:29.70 --> 02:48:31.70
I'm going to try and find it and put it out there.

3166
02:48:31.70 --> 02:48:35.70
So we can see this girl's super fired up and good at lip syncing.

3167
02:48:35.70 --> 02:48:36.70
Oh yeah.

3168
02:48:36.70 --> 02:48:36.70
Yeah.

3169
02:48:36.70 --> 02:48:38.70
She knows like spot on spot on.

3170
02:48:38.70 --> 02:48:41.70
Like if you didn't know you or her, like you'd be like,

3171
02:48:41.70 --> 02:48:43.70
Bro, this girl's voice is weird.

3172
02:48:43.70 --> 02:48:46.70
You know, because if she has your voice away, because it looks really good.

3173
02:48:46.70 --> 02:48:47.70
Yeah.

3174
02:48:47.70 --> 02:48:49.70
She did a good job with that psychological warfare.

3175
02:48:49.70 --> 02:48:55.70
Little assistance getting through moments of weakness in your day.

3176
02:48:55.70 --> 02:48:57.70
I'll tell you what to do.

3177
02:48:57.70 --> 02:48:59.70
I'll tell you why you should do it.

3178
02:48:59.70 --> 02:49:00.70
And then you'll go do it.

Also, for legit fitness gear, while you're still with developing your home gym,

3184
02:49:12.70 --> 02:49:15.70
which we always are, I still am.

3185
02:49:15.70 --> 02:49:16.70
This is where you get your stuff.

3186
02:49:16.70 --> 02:49:18.70
Go to on it.com slash chocolate.

3187
02:49:18.70 --> 02:49:20.70
A lot of good stuff on there.

3188
02:49:20.70 --> 02:49:22.70
I just got a storm trooper.

3189
02:49:22.70 --> 02:49:24.70
Oh wait, I told you this last time.

3190
02:49:24.70 --> 02:49:26.70
Okay, so I made a mistake.

3191
02:49:26.70 --> 02:49:28.70
So storm troopers are not clones.

3192
02:49:28.70 --> 02:49:30.70
Storm troopers are like individual humans.

3193
02:49:30.70 --> 02:49:32.70
Yeah, that they raised from kids or whatever.

3194
02:49:32.70 --> 02:49:37.70
Clones are the clones from the Clone War.

3195
02:49:37.70 --> 02:49:41.70
Who came from Bobo Fett or Jango Fett.

3196
02:49:41.70 --> 02:49:42.70
One of them.

3197
02:49:42.70 --> 02:49:44.70
Once again, bro, you're out of my league.

3198
02:49:44.70 --> 02:49:45.70
Yeah.

3199
02:49:45.70 --> 02:49:48.70
I got scolded by my brother and various people.

3200
02:49:48.70 --> 02:49:49.70
For not knowing my show was.

3201
02:49:49.70 --> 02:49:51.70
Yeah, Charles jumped on you like you just.

3202
02:49:51.70 --> 02:49:54.70
He was literally listening to it in my presence.

3203
02:49:54.70 --> 02:49:55.70
I didn't know he was listening to it.

3204
02:49:55.70 --> 02:49:56.70
He got to it.

3205
02:49:56.70 --> 02:49:57.70
He paused.

3206
02:49:57.70 --> 02:49:58.70
He's like, bro.

3207
02:49:58.70 --> 02:50:00.70
And I'm like, you know, one of these kind of like you.

3208
02:50:00.70 --> 02:50:01.70
I was like, who's like that kind?

3209
02:50:01.70 --> 02:50:02.70
Yeah.

3210
02:50:02.70 --> 02:50:03.70
And I was like, yeah.

3211
02:50:03.70 --> 02:50:04.70
Yeah.

3212
02:50:04.70 --> 02:50:05.70
And he's like, just storm troopers aren't.

3213
02:50:05.70 --> 02:50:07.70
But, and he was, he was mad.

3214
02:50:07.70 --> 02:50:09.70
Nonetheless, I still got the storm trooper kettlebell,

3215
02:50:09.70 --> 02:50:11.70
which has nothing to do with any clones.

3216
02:50:11.70 --> 02:50:12.70
It's just dope.

3217
02:50:12.70 --> 02:50:14.70
And it's a kettlebell, which is good for, you know,

3218
02:50:14.70 --> 02:50:16.70
you're working on and stuff.

3219
02:50:16.70 --> 02:50:17.70
Anyway, I got it from on it.

3220
02:50:17.70 --> 02:50:18.70
That's where they have the best.

3221
02:50:18.70 --> 02:50:20.70
The best kettlebells, the best stuff.

3222
02:50:20.70 --> 02:50:21.70
Go on there.

3223
02:50:21.70 --> 02:50:22.70
Get something from there.

3224
02:50:22.70 --> 02:50:23.70
It's really good stuff on it.

3225
02:50:23.70 --> 02:50:24.70
I'll come slash.

3226
02:50:24.70 --> 02:50:25.70
Jockel.

3227
02:50:25.70 --> 02:50:26.70
We also have some books.

3228
02:50:26.70 --> 02:50:28.70
What kind of books?

3229
02:50:28.70 --> 02:50:31.70
Well, books for reading, I guess you might say.

3230
02:50:31.70 --> 02:50:32.70
Mike in the dragons.

3231
02:50:32.70 --> 02:50:34.70
How'd you like Mike in the dragons?

3232
02:50:34.70 --> 02:50:35.70
I'll stand me.

3233
02:50:35.70 --> 02:50:36.70
How often do you read it?

3234
02:50:36.70 --> 02:50:38.70
So, I read.

3235
02:50:38.70 --> 02:50:40.70
It's not on any kind of rotation,

3236
02:50:40.70 --> 02:50:42.70
but I've read it three times.

3237
02:50:42.70 --> 02:50:44.70
Two of the children, yeah.

3238
02:50:44.70 --> 02:50:46.70
And did they support?

3239
02:50:46.70 --> 02:50:47.70
Yeah.

3240
02:50:47.70 --> 02:50:48.70
So, you know what's funny?

3241
02:50:48.70 --> 02:50:50.70
They literally not only do they like reading it.

3242
02:50:50.70 --> 02:50:51.70
They like watching the video,

3243
02:50:51.70 --> 02:50:54.70
which, and I'm working on the whole book video.

3244
02:50:54.70 --> 02:50:55.70
Yeah.

3245
02:50:55.70 --> 02:50:57.70
So, when I work on it or whatever, they, you know,

3246
02:50:57.70 --> 02:51:00.70
I'm not always uninterrupted.

3247
02:51:00.70 --> 02:51:01.70
We'll say that.

3248
02:51:01.70 --> 02:51:03.70
So, they'll see me working on that.

3249
02:51:03.70 --> 02:51:05.70
Then I get constant interruption because they want to watch it.

3250
02:51:05.70 --> 02:51:06.70
They want to see it.

3251
02:51:06.70 --> 02:51:09.70
But I mean, I dig it because it is fun.

3252
02:51:09.70 --> 02:51:10.70
Yeah.

3253
02:51:10.70 --> 02:51:11.70
Really good book.

3254
02:51:11.70 --> 02:51:15.70
Mike in the dragons, the little lessons for kids in that book.

3255
02:51:15.70 --> 02:51:18.70
It's probably meant for a little bit younger age.

3256
02:51:18.70 --> 02:51:20.70
It's than the other kids books have written.

3257
02:51:20.70 --> 02:51:21.70
Way the warrior kid.

3258
02:51:21.70 --> 02:51:24.70
And way the warrior kid, too, marks mission.

3259
02:51:24.70 --> 02:51:26.70
And now we have way the warrior kid.

3260
02:51:26.70 --> 02:51:27.70
Three.

3261
02:51:27.70 --> 02:51:31.70
I'm trying to get that up for pre-order on Amazon.

3262
02:51:31.70 --> 02:51:34.70
The subtitle is where there's a will.

3263
02:51:34.70 --> 02:51:38.70
And some challenges presented to mark in this latest book.

3264
02:51:38.70 --> 02:51:45.70
Thankfully, Uncle Jake is around to guide him and show him the path.

3265
02:51:45.70 --> 02:51:50.70
Also, we got this when he goes for you to a field manual.

3266
02:51:50.70 --> 02:51:55.70
It explains all the people that ask what you work out, what did you eat,

3267
02:51:55.70 --> 02:51:57.70
what time did you sleep, all those questions?

3268
02:51:57.70 --> 02:51:58.70
They're all in there.

3269
02:51:58.70 --> 02:52:04.70
And then all the questions that are, how do you, how do you get out of bed?

3270
02:52:04.70 --> 02:52:06.70
How do you, when you want to procrastinate?

3271
02:52:06.70 --> 02:52:07.70
What do you do in your tired?

3272
02:52:07.70 --> 02:52:08.70
What do you do in your angry?

3273
02:52:08.70 --> 02:52:09.70
What do you do in your afraid?

3274
02:52:09.70 --> 02:52:11.70
All those questions are put all those questions in one big book.

3275
02:52:11.70 --> 02:52:12.70
It's called the Discipline.

3276
02:52:12.70 --> 02:52:15.70
It was read a field manual.

3277
02:52:15.70 --> 02:52:20.70
And it's a book that you can give to someone.

3278
02:52:20.70 --> 02:52:24.70
And they will be happy.

3279
02:52:24.70 --> 02:52:25.70
Sure.

3280
02:52:25.70 --> 02:52:26.70
And they will not.

3281
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:31.70
They will get more from the book.

3282
02:52:31.70 --> 02:52:33.70
Then just a good read.

3283
02:52:33.70 --> 02:52:37.70
They'll get a little shift in their perspective in life.

3284
02:52:37.70 --> 02:52:46.70
And they might even hopefully get themselves head and down what we like to call the path.

3285
02:52:46.70 --> 02:52:47.70
The path of discipline.

3286
02:52:47.70 --> 02:52:53.70
I think you were right about that when you say that it's like the book that you sort of wish you had.

3287
02:52:53.70 --> 02:52:54.70
Go first.

3288
02:52:54.70 --> 02:53:01.70
Like when you, I would say maybe don't when I was like a teenager because I don't think I would have the capacity to write.

3289
02:53:01.70 --> 02:53:09.70
Yeah, to accept, you know, this kind of, but like young adulthood, maybe like 23, 23ish.

3290
02:53:09.70 --> 02:53:11.70
That would be like man.

3291
02:53:11.70 --> 02:53:16.70
And what's crazy is I've got people that are 54.

3292
02:53:16.70 --> 02:53:20.70
The one of the coolest things was I met a woman at the master.

3293
02:53:20.70 --> 02:53:23.70
She was like 55 years old.

3294
02:53:23.70 --> 02:53:24.70
And she was all excited.

3295
02:53:24.70 --> 02:53:28.70
She saw me and she's like, hey, and I was like, hey, we were working out.

3296
02:53:28.70 --> 02:53:29.70
And we got done with the workout.

3297
02:53:29.70 --> 02:53:30.70
Oh, you started in the gym or something?

3298
02:53:30.70 --> 02:53:32.70
No, no, no, no, in the, in the morning.

3299
02:53:32.70 --> 02:53:33.70
Oh, my goodness.

3300
02:53:33.70 --> 02:53:36.70
And she says to me, she says, you know why I'm here?

3301
02:53:36.70 --> 02:53:40.70
And I was said, actually, I have no idea why you're here or how you got here.

3302
02:53:40.70 --> 02:53:47.70
And she was in Costco or Walmart or Target and saw the discipline because freedom field manual.

3303
02:53:47.70 --> 02:53:49.70
And she just looked at it and said, I'm buying this.

3304
02:53:49.70 --> 02:53:50.70
I don't even know what it is.

3305
02:53:50.70 --> 02:53:51.70
I'm buying it.

3306
02:53:51.70 --> 02:53:54.70
God home, opened up Reddit.

3307
02:53:54.70 --> 02:53:57.70
Next day gets up 430 in the morning starts working out.

3308
02:53:57.70 --> 02:53:59.70
Like that's what we're talking about.

3309
02:53:59.70 --> 02:54:00.70
Zero.

3310
02:54:00.70 --> 02:54:06.70
This is a person that doesn't know anything about me about the podcast about any of the other books.

3311
02:54:06.70 --> 02:54:10.70
Just that one book picks up and says, this, I'm just going to get this.

3312
02:54:10.70 --> 02:54:12.70
And she was fired up.

3313
02:54:12.70 --> 02:54:14.70
She, she, she lost weight.

3314
02:54:14.70 --> 02:54:16.70
She's just crushing things.

3315
02:54:16.70 --> 02:54:20.70
So that's a good book to get for yourself.

3316
02:54:20.70 --> 02:54:22.70
It's a book that I read.

3317
02:54:22.70 --> 02:54:24.70
It keeps me on the path.

3318
02:54:24.70 --> 02:54:31.70
And if you want the audio version, it's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

3319
02:54:31.70 --> 02:54:33.70
There's obviously extreme ownership.

3320
02:54:33.70 --> 02:54:37.70
First book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

3321
02:54:37.70 --> 02:54:39.70
It's about leadership.

3322
02:54:39.70 --> 02:54:43.70
It's about the leadership principles we learned in combat and how you can apply them.

3323
02:54:43.70 --> 02:54:48.70
And then I talked about that kind of leadership today because sometimes we can take any principle.

3324
02:54:48.70 --> 02:54:50.70
And we can go to foreign one direction or another.

3325
02:54:50.70 --> 02:54:56.70
That can cause major derailment of your organization, your team, your life.

3326
02:54:56.70 --> 02:54:58.70
So read the dichotomy of leadership.

3327
02:54:58.70 --> 02:55:05.70
So you can know and understand and recognize the pitfalls of going too far in one direction or the other.

3328
02:55:05.70 --> 02:55:09.70
On top of those two books, we got a little company called Ashilon Front.

3329
02:55:09.70 --> 02:55:10.70
It's a leadership consultancy.

3330
02:55:10.70 --> 02:55:15.70
And what we do is we solve your problems through leadership.

3331
02:55:15.70 --> 02:55:17.70
That's what we do.

3332
02:55:17.70 --> 02:55:19.70
Whatever problems you're having to organization,

3333
02:55:19.70 --> 02:55:21.70
those problems are leadership problems.

3334
02:55:21.70 --> 02:55:23.70
No matter what those problems are, they're leadership problems.

3335
02:55:23.70 --> 02:55:25.70
That's what they are.

3336
02:55:25.70 --> 02:55:30.70
And if you want to get those problems fixed, go to ashilonfront.com.

3337
02:55:30.70 --> 02:55:33.70
And we'll be in touch.

3338
02:55:33.70 --> 02:55:37.70
Also the master, which is a leadership conference 2019.

3339
02:55:37.70 --> 02:55:39.70
We got May 23, 24th in Chicago.

3340
02:55:39.70 --> 02:55:41.70
We got September 19th in 20th in Denver.

3341
02:55:41.70 --> 02:55:44.70
We got December 4th in 5th in Sydney.

3342
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:48.70
All of our shows we've ever done have sold out.

3343
02:55:48.70 --> 02:55:51.70
These are going to sell out to if you want to come to them.

3344
02:55:51.70 --> 02:55:56.70
Go to extremotorship.com and work it out.

3345
02:55:56.70 --> 02:56:01.70
EF online just launched EF online in January.

3346
02:56:01.70 --> 02:56:08.70
If you can't come to the master, if you are living in a situation where you can't come to the master,

3347
02:56:08.70 --> 02:56:14.70
you can't afford the master, but you really want to get the information from the master.

3348
02:56:14.70 --> 02:56:16.70
Awesome.

3349
02:56:16.70 --> 02:56:20.70
You liked extreme ownership and you want to get more out of it.

3350
02:56:20.70 --> 02:56:24.70
Awesome. You like listening to podcast and you want to dig a little deeper.

3351
02:56:24.70 --> 02:56:28.70
Awesome. All those situations is why we made something called EF online.

3352
02:56:28.70 --> 02:56:30.70
Had a company.

3353
02:56:30.70 --> 02:56:34.70
18 months ago, guys said, hey, I want you to train everyone in my organization.

3354
02:56:34.70 --> 02:56:36.70
I said, yeah, do it. No problem.

3355
02:56:36.70 --> 02:56:38.70
And then I was like, wait a second.

3356
02:56:38.70 --> 02:56:40.70
How many people do you have?

3357
02:56:40.70 --> 02:56:42.70
87,000 globally.

3358
02:56:42.70 --> 02:56:45.70
Guess what? I was like, okay, let me.

3359
02:56:45.70 --> 02:56:47.70
Let me get back to you.

3360
02:56:47.70 --> 02:56:51.70
Because I humanly physically could not do that.

3361
02:56:51.70 --> 02:56:54.70
So I had to think about how we're going to scale this thing.

3362
02:56:54.70 --> 02:56:57.70
We talked to Lay from like, let's go.

3363
02:56:57.70 --> 02:56:58.70
Let's go digital.

3364
02:56:58.70 --> 02:57:04.70
And it's a little scary because in the Navy, we did like the digital training.

3365
02:57:04.70 --> 02:57:08.70
Sometimes online HR type training and it was a lame.

3366
02:57:08.70 --> 02:57:10.70
And so I was nervous about it.

3367
02:57:10.70 --> 02:57:14.70
But once we saw the new technology, which exists, which is awesome,

3368
02:57:14.70 --> 02:57:15.70
that's what we did.

3369
02:57:15.70 --> 02:57:17.70
So we spent the last year putting it together.

3370
02:57:17.70 --> 02:57:18.70
It's interactive.

3371
02:57:18.70 --> 02:57:19.70
You do role plays.

3372
02:57:19.70 --> 02:57:21.70
You put yourself in combat situations.

3373
02:57:21.70 --> 02:57:23.70
As a leader, you put yourself in business situations.

3374
02:57:23.70 --> 02:57:25.70
As a leader, you got frequently asked questions.

3375
02:57:25.70 --> 02:57:30.70
You got all kinds of choose your own adventure scenarios that are full.

3376
02:57:30.70 --> 02:57:37.70
And you get the briefings and explanations and details around the principles of combat leadership.

3377
02:57:37.70 --> 02:57:38.70
It's all in there.

3378
02:57:38.70 --> 02:57:40.70
So if you want to check that out,

3379
02:57:40.70 --> 02:57:45.70
it's at EF Online.com, EF Online.com,

3380
02:57:45.70 --> 02:57:54.70
and also we have EF Overwatch where we are finally taking combat proven leaders

3381
02:57:54.70 --> 02:57:58.70
from special operations and combat aviation.

3382
02:57:58.70 --> 02:58:05.70
And we're putting them into companies that need leaders that understand the principles that we talk about

3383
02:58:05.70 --> 02:58:08.70
in the books and on this podcast.

3384
02:58:08.70 --> 02:58:11.70
So EF Overwatch.com is where you go.

3385
02:58:11.70 --> 02:58:17.70
If you are either someone that's looking for talent or someone that's looking for a change of careers,

3386
02:58:17.70 --> 02:58:19.70
after you're done with your military career,

3387
02:58:19.70 --> 02:58:20.70
we're waiting for you there.

3388
02:58:20.70 --> 02:58:24.70
And if you want to talk to Echo and I, more,

3389
02:58:24.70 --> 02:58:27.70
if three hours wasn't enough,

3390
02:58:27.70 --> 02:58:33.70
if you need to tell us something else or you want to tell us something else or you want to ask us something else,

3391
02:58:33.70 --> 02:58:34.70
that's cool.

3392
02:58:34.70 --> 02:58:37.70
We are on the interwebs.

3393
02:58:37.70 --> 02:58:38.70
We are on Twitter.

3394
02:58:38.70 --> 02:58:40.70
We are on Instagram.

3395
02:58:40.70 --> 02:58:41.70
And we are on that page.

3396
02:58:41.70 --> 02:58:45.70
And Echo is at Echo Charles.

3397
02:58:45.70 --> 02:58:47.70
And I am at Jockel Willink.

3398
02:58:47.70 --> 02:58:52.70
And of course, thanks to everyone that is out there in uniform holding the line.

3399
02:58:52.70 --> 02:58:57.70
Our military personnel, police and law enforcement, firefighters,

3400
02:58:57.70 --> 02:59:00.70
paramedics, EMTs, correctional officers,

3401
02:59:00.70 --> 02:59:05.70
border patrols, all you first responders,

3402
02:59:05.70 --> 02:59:13.70
thanks for everything that you do to keep our safety and security intact.

3403
02:59:13.70 --> 02:59:19.70
And to everyone else, that's out there listening.

3404
02:59:19.70 --> 02:59:22.70
Remember what this book said.

3405
02:59:22.70 --> 02:59:27.70
And that's remember that real defeats other than death itself,

3406
02:59:27.70 --> 02:59:31.70
our psychological nature.

3407
02:59:31.70 --> 02:59:36.70
And that's the important contest in life itself,

3408
02:59:36.70 --> 02:59:38.70
our psychological nature.

3409
02:59:38.70 --> 02:59:40.70
So know who you're dealing with.

3410
02:59:40.70 --> 02:59:42.70
Know who you can count on.

3411
02:59:42.70 --> 02:59:45.70
Know your enemy and what his strength and weaknesses are.

3412
02:59:45.70 --> 02:59:49.70
And most important, know yourself.

3413
02:59:49.70 --> 02:59:51.70
Know your own nature.

3414
02:59:51.70 --> 02:59:58.70
So you can avoid the pitfalls that we are all susceptible to.

3415
02:59:58.70 --> 03:00:05.70
Know yourself so you can stand up in any situation and keep getting after it.

3416
03:00:05.70 --> 03:00:08.70
No matter what.

3417
03:00:08.70 --> 03:00:33.70
So until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
