You know, one thing I did over there because you know, the days over there could seem like Groundhog Day to the average soldier out there on a patrol day after day, you know, seeing, you know, these Iraqis give them the stink eye and all that. It's kind of like, you know, when you're in a, like, I don't know, maybe the police forces or something like that, where it's like, hey, we have the situation, then the police force like mounts up and they're like, okay, what's the situation? We learned we're going to Ramadi and then we kept thinking man are they going to change their mind because you know we were getting you know we were getting all the classified report you know what was going on over there as we saw how violent was and by the way. I mean, you know, 100 hours, you know, you know, the buildup certainly was longer, but you know, 100 hour war there. I was commissioned as a matter of, you know, you're about to admit this to about to know, I know that, but, you know, I'm still proud of my service, but I was a medical service core officer. Yeah, and then ship them over and then, you know, then, hey, you know, here's some jeans, which, you know, I don't know. I don't like to get wrapped up in, you know, people that are going to argue political points about, you know, the way things unfolded that the way things unfolded, right? It's going through with that mother and father are going through with the brothers sisters are going through with the wife or you know going through the spouse is going through and that's what gets me most emotional when I think about that. Because a lot of guys didn't know who I was you know who's this new guy coming to take command of brigade heels over to those three soldiers he said this is Colonel Gransky we're in good hands with him. We could deal with them, you know, because we could let them know that, hey, you, you know, men things settled down here when you get enough of your own sons and Iraqi police. Which I know I know people, um, I know it's hard to understand that concept of wanting to go to war. So I actually left the the country, but even, you know, like I liked you said, you know, they got murdered and that really. And that was the al Qaeda in Iraq segment who was doing that because, you know, as you as you know, you know, you mean there there there were different segments of the insurgency. And for the other soldiers that we might have got you know 40 soldiers from Illinois or you know another 130 soldiers from Michigan And listen to what they say, you know, they know things you don't know. I mean, you know, it was kind of like a family farm where, you know, I mean, all my brothers and sisters Jack or this is the weird thing when I heard second brigade was going to get mobilizing over to Iraq something told me I was going to go with them and I don't know what it was I just believed I was going to go over there with that brigade and. We're going to do a massive push through and I was telling my guys from a political standpoint, it made sense to me because this is why I told my guys I said look, I think this is going to happen and the reason I think it's going to happen is because Maliki, who just is the prime minister and he's a shea and this is a city filled with Sunni people. but I know there was a I.E.D. that the destroyed a tank in the Malab area which you talk about you know we're a soccer stadium was a tank commander was able to get all of his crewmen out of that tank without anybody getting wounded were worse and there's a fight that went on down there for at least 24 hours and a few soldiers were killed during that engagement from from the first at a five or six And I don't know if it's true or not, I don't know if you know it's true or not. One thing I did want to back up on a little bit though, Jocco is is, you know, when I came back when I did make that decision to join the National Guard, because the guys there seem like people I wanted to work with. And it was we could kill those bad guys and we could kill those bad guys and it was you know you could see you know you talk to a company commander and anyone of those company commanders that were out there they'd go out they'd get in patrol they'd get in a gunfight. One thing I learned over there, even from the Army, you know, a lot of times in our, if you're infantry, you know, you think all the other branches don't matter. Yeah I mean that was their goal you know talk about purpose you know talk about inspiring people by giving them a purpose that that was their purpose and life was to create. And I know, you know, obviously a lot of social unrest and there's a lot of things that may not be perfect about our country, but I get guaranteed this after being over and I rack after spending the last three years in Europe and traveling to about 40 different countries over there. And so I get back home, I'm talking to my wife and she goes, you know John, I think that's a good idea because your kids and your grandkids need to know the story. He was gonna go he was getting from a special operations group was going to do an operation and he was going to take some of his you know his seals and is Iraqi soldiers they were going to go and help them. One of the first things that we start planning for is like a philusia style clearance of Ramadi and the plan as I understood it and again, it seems like a long time ago in some ways, and this is one of those ways, trying to remember exactly, but the plan that as I remember is we were starting to organize this thing was that all when the one one AD showed up and we have the two two eight and the one one AD on the ground at the same time, we got double the combat power. You know, we're talking about extreme ownership a little bit earlier and you know, the, I opened it up talking about a blue on blue that we had you are there at the time. so you know just because two six nine was rotating out doesn't mean they didn't need tanks there so this is a great story about uh resilience I guess you could call it with with this national guard platoon that I had working with two six nine armor it was a it was a uh platoon from an armor unit in the twenty eight I.D. uh platoon of soldiers so that was I think we had about forty soldiers there So it's it's just have to again use, you know, real big in the army, you know, especially when you're a lieutenant or something and hey, you got to make a decision. And he said you know he is a good soldier you know he needs alcoholism counseling etc etc but he said I believe he's worth retaining. And he listened and that that was our attitude we were so thankful and grateful that you know you all helped us so much when we got on the ground and just the the the other thing you know we just had. They'd shoot at some people they wouldn't really know we would leave dead bodies in the streets of the insurgents and it was of the insurgents and that just seemed to be a really good asset and something that made the conventional guys man they were they were so happy when we'd show up at one of their one of their combat outposts they would be so happy for us to show up there because they knew that they'd send out a patrol and they'd get in a gunfight for sure and sometimes they'd kill a bad guy but they knew that we would we would rack up these kills and what's what's good about it is it allowed us to eliminate the bad guys wall protecting the populist Then in embarrass anybody did their job very professionally as they were conducting force pro at these at these bases because again after 90 11, you know, you know, what was going to happen with terrorist attacks at our installations over there. And I remember thinking, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to get mine because, you know, I was, I mean, you might have thought you wanted to go to war when you were 33 years old.
