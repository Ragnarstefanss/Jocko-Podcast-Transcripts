00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.44 This is Jocco podcast number 30.
00:00:04.44 --> 00:00:07.84 With that go Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:10.96 --> 00:00:22.32 And what we have this evening is straight Q&A, the last podcast that we did on the outstanding book
00:00:22.32 --> 00:00:28.52 called Boutoon Leader, a memoir of combat, of command in combat.
00:00:28.52 --> 00:00:32.92 It just took me a long time to get through.
00:00:32.92 --> 00:00:35.92 It's just a good book.
00:00:35.92 --> 00:00:42.32 And I just kept every time every page, I read it, I've got people got to hear that.
00:00:42.32 --> 00:00:43.32 People got to hear that.
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:44.32 People got to hear that.
00:00:44.32 --> 00:00:48.52 The next thing you know, you're two and a half hours deep.
00:00:48.52 --> 00:00:54.08 And since so much of it was pertain to leadership, there was commentary with each section.
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:56.84 And it was like, oh yeah, you know, this is what's going on here.
00:00:56.84 --> 00:01:01.88 And I recognize that and I wish I would have known that and that could have helped me here.
00:01:01.88 --> 00:01:05.72 So it went a little long.
00:01:05.72 --> 00:01:13.32 And that made us decide to just go ahead and turn that into one podcast.
00:01:13.32 --> 00:01:21.56 And now here we are coming back at you with a podcast number 30, which is straight Q&A.
00:01:21.56 --> 00:01:25.28 Yeah, there wasn't really one part of that book review that I was like, oh, you could have left that out.
00:01:25.28 --> 00:01:31.08 No, in the industry, we call that getting after.
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:32.68 Indeed.
00:01:32.68 --> 00:01:36.28 So let's, let's take into some Q&A here.
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:39.000 Some questions that we've been asked.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.80 You going to kick this one off?
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:41.80 Yes, sir.
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:42.80 Ego Drone.
00:01:42.80 --> 00:01:43.80 Yes, sir.
00:01:43.80 --> 00:01:44.80 Question number one.
00:01:44.80 --> 00:01:45.80 First question.
00:01:45.80 --> 00:01:50.76 Jocco, as an aid decamp, what were your duties?
00:01:50.76 --> 00:01:52.48 What did you learn?
00:01:52.48 --> 00:01:56.96 And why does that position still exist in the 21st century military?
00:01:56.96 --> 00:01:58.28 Well, the aid decamp.
00:01:58.28 --> 00:02:05.28 Okay, so first of all, an aid decamp is something in the military that it's only also
00:02:05.28 --> 00:02:11.40 to put it in a very simple way that people could understand it from.
00:02:11.40 --> 00:02:12.40 It's an assistant.
00:02:12.40 --> 00:02:19.56 It's like an executive assistant where, for me, I was, I was the admiral that's in charge
00:02:19.56 --> 00:02:22.08 of all the seals.
00:02:22.08 --> 00:02:24.08 I was his assistant.
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.52 You know, that's what an aid decamp is.
00:02:26.52 --> 00:02:33.32 Now, the question is why does that position still exist or what, you know, what did you learn
00:02:33.32 --> 00:02:35.48 while I learned a ton?
00:02:35.48 --> 00:02:36.48 No doubt about that.
00:02:36.48 --> 00:02:37.48 Why does the position still exist?
00:02:37.48 --> 00:02:39.48 I think it's absolutely necessary.
00:02:39.48 --> 00:02:40.48 It's not fun.
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:42.48 It's not a fun job.
00:02:42.48 --> 00:02:44.92 And I work for a great guy.
00:02:44.92 --> 00:02:47.72 But if you're working for something that's not a great guy, it's miserable.
00:02:47.72 --> 00:02:51.80 And even working for a great guy, it's not exactly the dream job.
00:02:51.80 --> 00:02:52.80 It wasn't for me.
00:02:52.80 --> 00:02:55.44 So here's what you do.
00:02:55.44 --> 00:02:59.44 The boss, which is what we call, this is what we called the admiral.
00:02:59.44 --> 00:03:01.40 We called him the boss, right?
00:03:01.40 --> 00:03:06.04 So what we did was what I did was the boss is always traveling.
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:11.28 I'm going different places, going to the Pentagon, going to visit outstations, going overseas,
00:03:11.28 --> 00:03:15.92 going just constantly going on travel and visiting people and visiting troops.
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:20.12 And so I was the guy that set up that travel.
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:21.12 That's what I did.
00:03:21.12 --> 00:03:25.52 And then, you know, communicating with whatever you're going to visit.
00:03:25.52 --> 00:03:27.36 Like, hey, the admiral's coming in.
00:03:27.36 --> 00:03:29.64 You know, what do you want us to do?
00:03:29.64 --> 00:03:30.84 Is there anything we need to be had?
00:03:30.84 --> 00:03:31.84 Zupon.
00:03:31.84 --> 00:03:37.92 So we take care of all that and set it up and make sure that the travel smooth.
00:03:37.92 --> 00:03:38.92 Because he's a really busy guy.
00:03:38.92 --> 00:03:39.92 It's like a CEO.
00:03:39.92 --> 00:03:44.32 He's like the CEO of a big giant, powerful worldwide company.
00:03:44.32 --> 00:03:45.32 That's what he is.
00:03:45.32 --> 00:03:49.32 And so you're trying to make the most of his time, make sure not wasting his time during
00:03:49.32 --> 00:03:50.80 travel.
00:03:50.80 --> 00:03:52.12 And so that's what I did.
00:03:52.12 --> 00:03:53.12 So that's part of it.
00:03:53.12 --> 00:04:02.56 And the other piece that's cool is you're kind of like an attrusted advisor or you
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:04.52 try and build the trust so that he trust you.
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:09.68 And they they usually, in our case, usually often try to find guys that come back from
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:15.40 the front lines and use them as the aid.
00:04:15.40 --> 00:04:20.80 So I had when I became the aid, it was actually my commanding officer.
00:04:20.80 --> 00:04:27.76 He, who's a friend of mine and who's a great guy that always took care of me.
00:04:27.76 --> 00:04:34.44 And he told me he said, hey, my final mission as the commanding officer of Seal Team 7 is
00:04:34.44 --> 00:04:39.48 to make sure that you become the aid to the admiral.
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:41.28 And you know, I wasn't happy about it.
00:04:41.28 --> 00:04:45.52 Because again, it's an administrative job.
00:04:45.52 --> 00:04:47.76 It's you have to wear uniform every day.
00:04:47.76 --> 00:04:52.52 Which was this 2005.
00:04:52.52 --> 00:04:59.04 And but it was, it was a good call that the that my commanding officer may be going to do
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:01.72 it because I did learn a ton.
00:05:01.72 --> 00:05:07.48 You know, you, you, I've been in the micro world of being a seal platoon for my whole life.
00:05:07.48 --> 00:05:08.48 Right.
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:09.48 So that's all I did.
00:05:09.48 --> 00:05:10.48 So you had to know anything else.
00:05:10.48 --> 00:05:12.000 I didn't understand anything else.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.56 So when you go off a Sunday, you're dealing with not only do you see the big picture of
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:20.000 the seal teams, but I saw the big picture of the army and the special operations command.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.44 And big navy, like the regular navy, we interacted with them a lot.
00:05:23.44 --> 00:05:25.20 So I got to learn a ton.
00:05:25.20 --> 00:05:27.96 I learned a ton about what?
00:05:27.96 --> 00:05:31.64 I learned it's sort of like seeing behind the curtain.
00:05:31.64 --> 00:05:36.04 You know, you get to see behind the curtain of the wizard and what's going on in the chambers.
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:41.08 And basically, you know, like how they make the sausage, you revert that term, you know,
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:45.28 they say when they make sausage, that you'll eat the sausage, it tastes good, but you
00:05:45.28 --> 00:05:47.36 don't want to see how they make it.
00:05:47.36 --> 00:05:49.28 So that's I got to see how they make the sausage.
00:05:49.28 --> 00:05:51.48 I got to see behind the curtain.
00:05:51.48 --> 00:05:56.20 And I learned a ton of that, you know, I got to sit like there was meetings that I would
00:05:56.20 --> 00:06:01.64 sit in super high level meetings with very powerful people in the meetings.
00:06:01.64 --> 00:06:06.000 And I would just be sitting there listening and seeing how these judgments were being made.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.20 And assessing the leadership and seeing what type of leaders we had at the highest levels
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:13.40 of the Pentagon.
00:06:13.40 --> 00:06:16.16 And as I was pretty, it was pretty interesting.
00:06:16.16 --> 00:06:18.76 And I definitely learned a lot.
00:06:18.76 --> 00:06:24.72 It was not fun because like I said, there was a ton of travel.
00:06:24.72 --> 00:06:32.08 You're wearing a uniform all the time, which seals are pretty well known for not wanting
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:34.000 to wear uniforms, real uniforms.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.48 And there I'd probably worn a uniform, a very small number of times.
00:06:39.48 --> 00:06:42.48 I'm talking to my whole naval career, a dress uniform.
00:06:42.48 --> 00:06:47.28 I'd probably worn one 15 times.
00:06:47.28 --> 00:06:50.20 I don't know the number, but it's a tiny number.
00:06:50.20 --> 00:06:52.04 And I was on the mat, working for the Admiral.
00:06:52.04 --> 00:06:54.88 I'm wearing a uniform every single day.
00:06:54.88 --> 00:06:57.68 And there were sometimes we'd go on a trip and I'd have to wear, if there's multiple
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:01.76 different dress uniforms in the Navy and most of the services, we'd go on some
00:07:01.76 --> 00:07:06.000 board I'd have to bring two or three different dress uniforms.
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.56 So my uniforms were always ready.
00:07:07.56 --> 00:07:11.56 That was one thing that not too many people could claim as you get really good at your
00:07:11.56 --> 00:07:15.12 uniforms.
00:07:15.12 --> 00:07:17.92 But there's also some things that are pretty restrictive.
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:27.24 For instance, you're actually not allowed to do personal favors for the boss.
00:07:27.24 --> 00:07:29.76 Like I wasn't allowed.
00:07:29.76 --> 00:07:34.44 Is this idea, because they're very cautious that the military senior people might abuse
00:07:34.44 --> 00:07:36.76 people in the military?
00:07:36.76 --> 00:07:43.68 And like I wasn't allowed, for instance, I wasn't allowed to go pick up his laundry.
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:49.84 Like if you got his uniforms pressed and clean, I wasn't allowed to go and run to the
00:07:49.84 --> 00:07:51.68 store and pick it up if we were going on a trip or something.
00:07:51.68 --> 00:07:53.44 Like it wasn't allowed to do it.
00:07:53.44 --> 00:07:55.88 We weren't allowed to fly first class.
00:07:55.88 --> 00:08:01.20 If there was only one time we flew first class, that was when we get upgrades after
00:08:01.20 --> 00:08:03.56 a while because we were traveling so much.
00:08:03.56 --> 00:08:08.76 But so both you guys couldn't, or just the AD camp.
00:08:08.76 --> 00:08:10.20 No, neither one of us.
00:08:10.20 --> 00:08:12.000 We wouldn't fly first class.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.48 Yeah, it's the military sort of, you know, we don't want to, they don't want to
00:08:19.48 --> 00:08:21.20 be fraudwaste in abuse.
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:22.72 Which is actually ridiculous.
00:08:22.72 --> 00:08:25.000 This guy's the equivalent of a CEO of a big company.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.72 And they wouldn't get the guy first class to get stuff fly from San Diego to Washington,
00:08:29.72 --> 00:08:33.56 DC to go to the Pentagon and brief some senior government's leadership.
00:08:33.56 --> 00:08:34.96 Yeah, fully, that's a good philosophy.
00:08:34.96 --> 00:08:35.96 They don't waste.
00:08:35.96 --> 00:08:40.96 Yeah, I know it's a good philosophy, but they should have, I think he'd earn at that point.
00:08:40.96 --> 00:08:41.96 Right.
00:08:41.96 --> 00:08:43.96 30 something years in the Navy.
00:08:43.96 --> 00:08:47.08 Yeah, for that service, country and just be, you know, hey, you know what, this guy
00:08:47.08 --> 00:08:50.000 should be well rested when he shows up to brief Congress.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000 Yeah.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.40 You know, so that was that. And then the reason I think it's necessary again is because
00:08:56.40 --> 00:09:01.48 you got you take a guy, you know, the, the, the admiral, they're, they're not going to
00:09:01.48 --> 00:09:06.24 usually, you're often may not have been in recent combat situations.
00:09:06.24 --> 00:09:09.000 And so this aide that's coming in, he's coming off the battlefield.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.84 So he can say, hey, so he was going on here.
00:09:10.84 --> 00:09:14.000 Hey, sir, this is what this is like, hey, sir, this is some gear that we need up on the
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000 front lines.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.80 Hey, sir, this is what the front line troopers think about this program that we're doing,
00:09:19.80 --> 00:09:24.56 or this rule that's being imposed upon us, we need to change this.
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:26.16 So we need to get it fixed.
00:09:26.16 --> 00:09:29.88 So I had a great relationship with with with the boss when I was running that job.
00:09:29.88 --> 00:09:35.76 And it was very beneficial for me on my next appointment when I deployed Ramani.
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:36.76 And I knew the admiral.
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.76 Mm-hmm.
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:41.32 I mean, it was, you know, he's the guy that's in charge of all seals.
00:09:41.32 --> 00:09:43.80 And there I was in Ramani.
00:09:43.80 --> 00:09:48.44 And you know, there was times where we talked directly, you know,
00:09:48.44 --> 00:09:54.92 he called me up and say, hey, what's going on, or you know, after my guy's got killed,
00:09:54.92 --> 00:09:56.92 he called me up directly.
00:09:56.92 --> 00:09:59.16 And that really meant a lot to me.
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:03.88 And I think he meant a lot to him too, because he had a connection with the guys that were
00:10:03.88 --> 00:10:07.56 out there, because he knew me and knew, you know, knew me well.
00:10:07.56 --> 00:10:10.52 So I think that was, I think I was very important.
00:10:10.52 --> 00:10:12.68 And I think it's a, it's a good job.
00:10:12.68 --> 00:10:14.12 I'm not going to say you're going to like it.
00:10:14.12 --> 00:10:18.12 If there's troopers out there that are up for that job, you're not going to like it.
00:10:18.12 --> 00:10:23.24 If you're, if you're a hard-court, get an after kind of guy, you're not going to like the job.
00:10:23.24 --> 00:10:27.32 The people that actually in the scary thing is that people that volunteer and want to have
00:10:27.32 --> 00:10:30.68 that job are usually the guys, the animals don't want, because that's a guy that's like
00:10:30.68 --> 00:10:32.48 focused on advancing his career.
00:10:32.48 --> 00:10:35.52 And hey, if I'm coming, coming in aid, then I'll know the admiral.
00:10:35.52 --> 00:10:38.56 And so you're not going to, those of the guys, the admiral's actually, at least the admiral
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:40.28 I work for, he didn't want any guys like that.
00:10:40.28 --> 00:10:44.28 He wanted guys that were going to say, oh, I, I want a guy that's going to come kicking and
00:10:44.28 --> 00:10:45.64 screaming to this job.
00:10:45.64 --> 00:10:46.64 Yeah.
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:50.12 Because he doesn't want to, it's where it uniform.
00:10:50.12 --> 00:10:51.12 He wants to be in the field.
00:10:51.12 --> 00:10:52.76 I want to be in the field.
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:55.16 So that's kind of the AD camp.
00:10:55.16 --> 00:10:59.76 So if there's a trooper out there that's going to get pushed in that position, you know,
00:10:59.76 --> 00:11:01.32 you might have to do it.
00:11:01.32 --> 00:11:05.56 And, and when you do it, you do the best that you can.
00:11:05.56 --> 00:11:13.56 When, when the guy that took over for me, he said, because I was, you know, I was, I've
00:11:13.56 --> 00:11:14.96 always been early to work.
00:11:14.96 --> 00:11:18.64 Well, when I was working for the boss, I was even earlier because this is, you know, I've felt
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:21.76 this, this responsibility that, you know, I got to take care of this guy.
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:22.76 He's taking care of all the seals.
00:11:22.76 --> 00:11:23.76 I got to take care of him.
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:24.76 Right?
00:11:24.76 --> 00:11:29.12 This guy, the more the easier I make his job, the easier I make his life, the more he can
00:11:29.12 --> 00:11:34.28 focus on taking care of all the guys that are in the field and all the seals.
00:11:34.28 --> 00:11:39.04 And so when I, I was get show up even earlier than I would normally show up and I was
00:11:39.04 --> 00:11:43.16 double in triple in quadruple check everything that was going on.
00:11:43.16 --> 00:11:48.76 And when the guy came, it to relieve me and take my place.
00:11:48.76 --> 00:11:54.92 And he said, he said, you know, hey, how does the, how does the boss react if you drop
00:11:54.92 --> 00:11:57.76 the ball on something?
00:11:57.76 --> 00:12:00.92 And I said, I don't know.
00:12:00.92 --> 00:12:01.92 I don't know.
00:12:01.92 --> 00:12:03.24 I, I didn't drop the ball.
00:12:03.24 --> 00:12:06.08 I mean, that's, that was, you know, a lot of luck involved.
00:12:06.08 --> 00:12:11.04 And I had some, some other guys that were with me that really helped me out, you know,
00:12:11.04 --> 00:12:16.16 one guy in particular is a civilian guy that is, is steady, works, there has always worked
00:12:16.16 --> 00:12:19.28 there and worked there for a long time and he was always covered in my tracks and helped
00:12:19.28 --> 00:12:23.68 me not drop the ball, but he, I never dropped the ball.
00:12:23.68 --> 00:12:26.16 You know, it's kind of a good answer to that question.
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:30.08 Like, because, you know, if you're like, oh, hey, well, he doesn't take it so hard.
00:12:30.08 --> 00:12:34.28 Almost like the might plant something in his mind where it may not be as important every
00:12:34.28 --> 00:12:35.28 single time or something.
00:12:35.28 --> 00:12:37.12 That's important every time you can't drop the ball.
00:12:37.12 --> 00:12:38.12 Yes.
00:12:38.12 --> 00:12:42.24 You gotta keep it going.
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:44.68 Is it ever viewed by, by people, whatever that job is like, kind of emasculating or something
00:12:44.68 --> 00:12:49.40 because you're like, like, like an assistant more so than, you know, I don't know.
00:12:49.40 --> 00:12:51.44 I maybe, maybe somebody views it that way.
00:12:51.44 --> 00:12:52.44 Yeah.
00:12:52.44 --> 00:12:56.20 You know, I will, I will military guy that got tasked with a job to take care of the senior
00:12:56.20 --> 00:13:01.44 seal officer and keep his day moving so that he can take care of the troops.
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:03.20 I don't, I think that's beneficial.
00:13:03.20 --> 00:13:04.20 I, right?
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:05.20 I didn't, I didn't feel that way.
00:13:05.20 --> 00:13:09.44 The other thing is you're not, like I said, you're not allowed to do certain things.
00:13:09.44 --> 00:13:17.44 Well, you're not allowed to do personal things form and even, and the guy that I work for
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:23.60 was very laid back and, I mean, and part of the reason he was laid back was because I never
00:13:23.60 --> 00:13:24.60 dropped the ball from him.
00:13:24.60 --> 00:13:28.16 I wouldn't want to drop the ball because I'm sure he would be angry.
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:29.40 Yeah.
00:13:29.40 --> 00:13:32.72 But, yeah, it wasn't a bad job.
00:13:32.72 --> 00:13:33.72 Yeah.
00:13:33.72 --> 00:13:38.000 But, I would think if you understand the value of the job, really understand the value
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.68 of a job, you probably will never really feel emasculator or anything.
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:49.48 But I think, you know, sometimes some of us can go into jobs and be like, you know,
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:52.60 I'm a leader, I'm not a helper.
00:13:52.60 --> 00:13:54.24 You know, kind of kind of attitude.
00:13:54.24 --> 00:13:55.24 Yeah.
00:13:55.24 --> 00:14:00.28 Well, it's interesting too because when you're working for the admiral, then when you speak,
00:14:00.28 --> 00:14:04.36 you kind of kind of, you kind of speak for the admiral.
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:09.04 So in other words, when I'd go into talk to some senior captains and I said, hey, can I get
00:14:09.04 --> 00:14:11.40 a copy of XYZ?
00:14:11.40 --> 00:14:12.84 They knew it wasn't me that wanted it.
00:14:12.84 --> 00:14:14.28 They knew it was the boss that wanted it.
00:14:14.28 --> 00:14:15.68 So people are snapping too.
00:14:15.68 --> 00:14:18.64 So it was pretty, it was interesting from that perspective.
00:14:18.64 --> 00:14:23.52 You know, all the young lieutenant at the time, I'd go in and say, hey, can we get this,
00:14:23.52 --> 00:14:25.08 we need this report?
00:14:25.08 --> 00:14:27.72 And the guy's going to be like jumping to like full captains would be jumping to because
00:14:27.72 --> 00:14:31.08 they knew that it wasn't for me and they respected the boss and they wanted to help
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:32.08 them out.
00:14:32.08 --> 00:14:38.52 So it was, you do, you get a little bit of added weight because people know, especially
00:14:38.52 --> 00:14:41.000 because people kind of knew we had a good relationship.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.68 And so they knew that if I was asking for something or I needed something or I was suggesting
00:14:44.68 --> 00:14:47.12 something, they knew where I was coming from.
00:14:47.12 --> 00:14:49.000 They knew it was coming from the big boss man.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.04 So it was kind of like, like, the executive assistant to like Oprah or something.
00:14:55.04 --> 00:15:00.40 Well, no, there you go.
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:04.20 We're not going to talk about the person that you just talked about on this podcast.
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:06.20 It's not happening.
00:15:06.20 --> 00:15:08.88 I gotcha.
00:15:08.88 --> 00:15:11.24 There, there.
00:15:11.24 --> 00:15:17.20 I'm just saying, you know, if you go around and you're like, hey, I need.
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:22.36 I would say it would be the equivalent of being the executive assistant to a very powerful
00:15:22.36 --> 00:15:32.44 CEO that has a lot of stress and decisions to make and has a large global corporation.
00:15:32.44 --> 00:15:33.44 Yeah.
00:15:33.44 --> 00:15:35.64 In their under their command.
00:15:35.64 --> 00:15:39.36 Actually, that kind of reminds me of the whole flying first class thing.
00:15:39.36 --> 00:15:42.80 And I thought about this where there was a big part of me that thought, oh, yeah, a lot
00:15:42.80 --> 00:15:46.60 of guys, they'll just fly first class just because that's like a sadist thing.
00:15:46.60 --> 00:15:47.96 And like, oh, yeah, I'm this high.
00:15:47.96 --> 00:15:50.68 So I get to, you kind of live in this luxury.
00:15:50.68 --> 00:15:58.04 But flying first class eliminates a lot of stress and a lot of like decision making and
00:15:58.04 --> 00:16:00.64 headaches, you know, we're contending with certain things.
00:16:00.64 --> 00:16:01.64 Yeah.
00:16:01.64 --> 00:16:03.80 So when you arrive, you have way less on your mind.
00:16:03.80 --> 00:16:06.000 So, and that's a lot.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.24 You ever had to do something or convey some important message, but you have a lot on your
00:16:10.24 --> 00:16:11.48 mind, some other stuff.
00:16:11.48 --> 00:16:12.76 It makes it way harder.
00:16:12.76 --> 00:16:14.76 Yeah, then I just prioritize an execute.
00:16:14.76 --> 00:16:15.76 Yeah.
00:16:15.76 --> 00:16:19.48 I know, but it has its function is what I'm saying.
00:16:19.48 --> 00:16:20.48 It does.
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:29.12 And there was the time that the literally the one time we were authorized and executed
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:32.000 a first class travel was when we flew to Europe.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.68 And when we arrived at six o'clock in the morning, the boss or seven o'clock in the morning,
00:16:36.68 --> 00:16:40.72 the boss was talking to the troops half an hour later.
00:16:40.72 --> 00:16:44.72 And then the whole day was scheduled about talking to the local senior leadership.
00:16:44.72 --> 00:16:47.52 So he needed to be arrested when he showed up there.
00:16:47.52 --> 00:16:52.20 Now, me on the other hand, if I remember correctly, I was in the chief seat.
00:16:52.20 --> 00:16:54.52 But you don't really need that much rest.
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:55.68 Because you're saying that.
00:16:55.68 --> 00:16:57.68 Young Lieutenant can just suck it up.
00:16:57.68 --> 00:16:59.08 Because it is pretty pathetic.
00:16:59.08 --> 00:17:00.60 We're sitting here talking about first class.
00:17:00.60 --> 00:17:01.60 Do we, you know what?
00:17:01.60 --> 00:17:03.08 Let's just talk about Bob Hoffman.
00:17:03.08 --> 00:17:04.08 Do you know what I mean?
00:17:04.08 --> 00:17:04.92 Well, war won.
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:05.92 Trench warfare.
00:17:05.92 --> 00:17:08.52 Yeah, he used to worry about flying first class.
00:17:08.52 --> 00:17:10.32 Yeah, and he had a lot of decisions to me.
00:17:10.32 --> 00:17:11.32 Yeah.
00:17:11.32 --> 00:17:12.96 So let's just suck it up.
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:13.96 I'm stuck it up.
00:17:13.96 --> 00:17:14.96 All right.
00:17:14.96 --> 00:17:16.96 That's a question.
00:17:16.96 --> 00:17:20.92 Marco, do you have a suggestion for Marshall Art for a wheelchair user?
00:17:20.92 --> 00:17:26.64 I'm considering FMA, just Filipino martial arts or Krav Maga.
00:17:26.64 --> 00:17:29.84 I want exercise and self defense.
00:17:29.84 --> 00:17:36.08 Well, again, this is as usual.
00:17:36.08 --> 00:17:46.92 My first suggestion for true self defense to protect yourself from the world.
00:17:46.92 --> 00:17:51.16 And the evils of the world concealed caring.
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:55.96 You know, get a weapon or not a shoot a weapon spend time at the range train train with
00:17:55.96 --> 00:17:57.04 it is a mart.
00:17:57.04 --> 00:17:58.76 Shooting a weapon is a martial art.
00:17:58.76 --> 00:18:01.48 Carrying a weapon is a martial art.
00:18:01.48 --> 00:18:05.44 Knowing how to use that weapon in various situations, it is a martial art.
00:18:05.44 --> 00:18:08.24 So shooting is a martial art.
00:18:08.24 --> 00:18:15.000 And so that's the most effective martial art to know and to have the possession of
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.20 the weapon is concealed carry weapons.
00:18:19.20 --> 00:18:26.12 So again, I'm not saying that just because this individual's in a wheelchair.
00:18:26.12 --> 00:18:34.68 Because, I mean, obviously being in a wheelchair does put you at a disadvantage.
00:18:34.68 --> 00:18:38.72 But it doesn't matter wheelchair or not.
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:41.60 There's always going to be somebody that's bigger and better than you.
00:18:41.60 --> 00:18:44.80 And if there's not somebody that's bigger and better than you, then there's three or four
00:18:44.80 --> 00:18:47.64 people come by and together that make a person that's better than you.
00:18:47.64 --> 00:18:49.52 That's called a gang.
00:18:49.52 --> 00:18:57.68 And I will tell you right now, any three people in the world can beat anyone in the world
00:18:57.68 --> 00:18:58.84 of the night.
00:18:58.84 --> 00:19:01.64 Like three on one, you're going to lose.
00:19:01.64 --> 00:19:02.64 Oh, okay.
00:19:02.64 --> 00:19:05.04 Now, can you get a guy that knocks him or somebody out turns around?
00:19:05.04 --> 00:19:06.84 I mean, it does happen.
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:12.60 But if people that are attacking know anything, you have a really bad chance, really
00:19:12.60 --> 00:19:13.60 bad chance of winning.
00:19:13.60 --> 00:19:16.52 It's very tough to win a fight three on one.
00:19:16.52 --> 00:19:20.04 So train with firearms, get a gun.
00:19:20.04 --> 00:19:23.96 And you know also, and you mentioned the Filipino martial arts.
00:19:23.96 --> 00:19:28.88 And I sometimes fail to mention this to carry a knife.
00:19:28.88 --> 00:19:30.92 But yeah, you should absolutely have a knife.
00:19:30.92 --> 00:19:32.64 You should know how to use it.
00:19:32.64 --> 00:19:40.40 So that is your Filipino martial arts generally, learning to use a knife and carry a knife.
00:19:40.40 --> 00:19:43.32 And then what am I going to do after that?
00:19:43.32 --> 00:19:45.60 I'm going to do the same thing I was talking about.
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:47.28 Do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:49.36 Kind of in that order.
00:19:49.36 --> 00:19:52.32 Now, do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?
00:19:52.32 --> 00:19:53.32 We start with jujitsu.
00:19:53.32 --> 00:19:54.32 We move on to boxing.
00:19:54.32 --> 00:19:56.68 We learn wrestling and boy learn more tie.
00:19:56.68 --> 00:19:59.92 Sometimes, boy tie and wrestling, you can flip back and forth, which one you want to focus
00:19:59.92 --> 00:20:00.92 on.
00:20:00.92 --> 00:20:02.32 The deal is with all three of those.
00:20:02.32 --> 00:20:06.24 You have to adapt them to the situation that you're in.
00:20:06.24 --> 00:20:08.24 Whatever that situation is.
00:20:08.24 --> 00:20:11.24 Now, if you're in a wheelchair, I don't know what this is going to look like for you.
00:20:11.24 --> 00:20:13.000 I don't know what that looks like.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.20 You've got to learn it.
00:20:14.20 --> 00:20:15.20 You've got to understand it.
00:20:15.20 --> 00:20:16.88 You've got to make things work.
00:20:16.88 --> 00:20:17.88 You've got to figure it out.
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:18.88 You've got to test it.
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:19.88 You've got to see what's effective.
00:20:19.88 --> 00:20:23.48 And you've got to see what isn't effective.
00:20:23.48 --> 00:20:25.68 And you have to adapt.
00:20:25.68 --> 00:20:26.68 You have to adapt.
00:20:26.68 --> 00:20:30.80 And I've trained with all kinds of different people.
00:20:30.80 --> 00:20:36.92 And have their own obstacles to overcome.
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:43.28 I've trained with guys that have amputees, misinone, leg, two legs, misinorms.
00:20:43.28 --> 00:20:45.64 I've trained with people that are blind.
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:48.56 I've trained with people that are paralyzed.
00:20:48.56 --> 00:20:53.76 I've trained with people with traumatic brain injuries.
00:20:53.76 --> 00:20:57.12 And they all work and try and figure away.
00:20:57.12 --> 00:20:58.24 And they do figure ways.
00:20:58.24 --> 00:21:01.28 You've got kind of like a Kyle Manard.
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:02.28 Do you know who that is?
00:21:02.28 --> 00:21:03.28 Yes, they do.
00:21:03.28 --> 00:21:06.48 He's got norms and no legs.
00:21:06.48 --> 00:21:09.88 And he trains due to and he wrestled in high school.
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:12.56 He competed and he competed in due to.
00:21:12.56 --> 00:21:17.88 He's actually competed in MMA as well, which is crazy.
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:19.48 But you know what?
00:21:19.48 --> 00:21:23.56 He adapts to the situation that he's in.
00:21:23.56 --> 00:21:28.36 And there's Anthony Robles.
00:21:28.36 --> 00:21:30.16 He's in C.D.
00:21:30.16 --> 00:21:31.16 NC.
00:21:31.16 --> 00:21:36.12 AA, 125 pound champion.
00:21:36.12 --> 00:21:37.12 Champion.
00:21:37.12 --> 00:21:39.08 And by the way, he has one leg.
00:21:39.08 --> 00:21:40.08 I mean one leg.
00:21:40.08 --> 00:21:43.08 His other leg is gone from the hip down.
00:21:43.08 --> 00:21:44.84 One leg.
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:47.92 And he won the NC AA Championship.
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:51.16 That's incredible.
00:21:51.16 --> 00:21:52.16 And he just did that.
00:21:52.16 --> 00:21:53.96 He got John Jacques Mishado.
00:21:53.96 --> 00:21:56.80 He's got one hand, Jeff Rial.
00:21:56.80 --> 00:21:57.80 Jeff Rial.
00:21:57.80 --> 00:21:58.96 He's trains with us.
00:21:58.96 --> 00:22:00.64 He's got one hand.
00:22:00.64 --> 00:22:01.92 His other hand's gone.
00:22:01.92 --> 00:22:03.96 He was born with no hand.
00:22:03.96 --> 00:22:04.96 Oh, guess what?
00:22:04.96 --> 00:22:08.44 Now all you just you players out there that you think about when you're doing you just
00:22:08.44 --> 00:22:09.36 with the G.
00:22:09.36 --> 00:22:10.68 And think of how much you grab.
00:22:10.68 --> 00:22:13.80 When you're trading with Jeff, you don't even know that he doesn't have a hand.
00:22:13.80 --> 00:22:14.96 He just don't even know.
00:22:14.96 --> 00:22:16.44 He just does other stuff.
00:22:16.44 --> 00:22:17.44 He's adapted to it.
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:21.84 As a matter of fact, he uses that stomp to choke you in attack you.
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:22.84 He gets in there.
00:22:22.84 --> 00:22:27.84 Yeah, he sneaks that thing in there.
00:22:27.84 --> 00:22:29.84 We have a max, max a million.
00:22:29.84 --> 00:22:31.84 Yeah, yeah, max right.
00:22:31.84 --> 00:22:33.84 Max, he's paralyzed.
00:22:33.84 --> 00:22:35.64 But and that's recent too.
00:22:35.64 --> 00:22:36.64 So yeah, yeah.
00:22:36.64 --> 00:22:38.04 You know, he got paralyzed.
00:22:38.04 --> 00:22:39.04 What?
00:22:39.04 --> 00:22:40.04 Three years, five or four years ago?
00:22:40.04 --> 00:22:41.04 Something like that.
00:22:41.04 --> 00:22:42.04 Yeah.
00:22:42.04 --> 00:22:43.44 He was like maybe a white belt.
00:22:43.44 --> 00:22:44.44 Maybe a bean belt.
00:22:44.44 --> 00:22:45.44 He's a blue belt.
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:46.84 I think he's a purple now.
00:22:46.84 --> 00:22:47.84 Yeah, I think he's a purple now.
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:51.44 But I mean, he's got basically, I think it's about sternum down.
00:22:51.44 --> 00:22:53.44 He's completely paralyzed sternum down.
00:22:53.44 --> 00:22:54.44 Yeah.
00:22:54.44 --> 00:22:58.000 And he's so he's figured out he actually has to move his legs.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.84 You know, like he, when he's when you're rolling with him, he's got to grab his legs
00:23:00.84 --> 00:23:05.12 and move him into different positions, which is crazy.
00:23:05.12 --> 00:23:06.12 But he's still training.
00:23:06.12 --> 00:23:08.84 He's advancing and he's learning to adapt.
00:23:08.84 --> 00:23:10.56 He knows how to choke you.
00:23:10.56 --> 00:23:13.32 He's figured things out.
00:23:13.32 --> 00:23:20.000 So whether you're shorter, tall, bigger, small, old, their yugs, stronger, weak,
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.52 wheelchair, no wheelchair, leg, no leg, learn it, learn it all.
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:31.72 And start with you, Jitsu, learn some boxing, some mojitai, then wrestling.
00:23:31.72 --> 00:23:35.76 And then once you get that base built up, start looking at crawvmogastar, looking at
00:23:35.76 --> 00:23:36.76 kali.
00:23:36.76 --> 00:23:43.60 So you can learn, you know, if you want to learn weapons, and obviously from the beginning,
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:45.56 the firearm trumps everything.
00:23:45.56 --> 00:23:46.56 Yeah.
00:23:46.56 --> 00:23:49.96 Yeah, especially when you're training with, like any kind of distance,
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:55.56 advantage or whatever, I think it's important to understand what your potential goal will
00:23:55.56 --> 00:23:57.80 be in a self-defense situation.
00:23:57.80 --> 00:24:02.48 So if you're, you know, like if you don't have legs like Max, for example, like you
00:24:02.48 --> 00:24:07.60 can learn a lot of stuff that is just defensive.
00:24:07.60 --> 00:24:13.64 And if you know Jitsu, and I'm a son like a Jitsu advocate, which I am.
00:24:13.64 --> 00:24:19.20 But if you learn Jitsu, you'll learn how to be defensive, how you can shut down another
00:24:19.20 --> 00:24:20.72 guy's attacks.
00:24:20.72 --> 00:24:25.84 And he's so like I said, like if you're, like your disadvantage is pretty big, just understand
00:24:25.84 --> 00:24:30.64 what your goals will be in a potential self-defense situation.
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:34.24 You know, so you're not going to be like, okay, I'm going to learn these martial arts.
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:37.88 So I can kick as much ass as I possibly can.
00:24:37.88 --> 00:24:38.88 Yeah, that's the point.
00:24:38.88 --> 00:24:43.44 The point of this is that you have to adapt.
00:24:43.44 --> 00:24:44.44 You have to adapt.
00:24:44.44 --> 00:24:46.12 You have to say, okay, this is what I'm going to do.
00:24:46.12 --> 00:24:48.44 And this is, I can't do that move, but I can do this move.
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.68 And by the way, you can't do this, but I can do that.
00:24:50.68 --> 00:24:51.68 Yes.
00:24:51.68 --> 00:24:54.52 And you know, like we were just talking about Jeffrey, all the Jeffrey Alzagai trained with
00:24:54.52 --> 00:24:56.76 the most regularly out of these folks.
00:24:56.76 --> 00:25:03.32 And he has adapted and does things that you, that is totally unique to him.
00:25:03.32 --> 00:25:04.72 And he makes an event.
00:25:04.72 --> 00:25:06.76 He takes a disadvantage, turns it into an advantage.
00:25:06.76 --> 00:25:11.88 You know, yeah, there's an MMA guy who was the champ and one of these shows, I forget.
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:13.12 I might have been bellotaur, maybe.
00:25:13.12 --> 00:25:14.72 I don't know, I forget.
00:25:14.72 --> 00:25:19.36 But he used, he had one hand too, he used the champ though.
00:25:19.36 --> 00:25:21.64 I think one, how do I know who that is?
00:25:21.64 --> 00:25:23.76 I forget his name too, but it was wild.
00:25:23.76 --> 00:25:25.52 It's like maybe a year ago or something or more.
00:25:25.52 --> 00:25:26.76 A while ago a year.
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:28.80 And it's been around for 20 plus years.
00:25:28.80 --> 00:25:29.80 Right.
00:25:29.80 --> 00:25:30.80 But in America.
00:25:30.80 --> 00:25:34.08 The current champ is always seem so new.
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.32 Yeah, that's awesome.
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:41.16 That is definitely outstanding to see people overcome that.
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:44.48 And in what you can do.
00:25:44.48 --> 00:25:53.64 You just gotta have that, that, that, the creative mind to get in there and adapt to the situation.
00:25:53.64 --> 00:25:54.64 Yeah.
00:25:54.64 --> 00:25:59.76 And it goes along with kind of what I think it was, I forget to.
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:04.32 But how they say, you know, a little exercise is better than no exercise, you know?
00:26:04.32 --> 00:26:08.56 So sometimes like if you find yourself in a wheelchair or something like this, where it'll
00:26:08.56 --> 00:26:10.64 be like, oh yeah, that's not for me.
00:26:10.64 --> 00:26:12.64 But this obviously is for him.
00:26:12.64 --> 00:26:13.64 You know?
00:26:13.64 --> 00:26:17.44 And like how you say, like, learn something or learn it all, whatever.
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:18.72 That's better than not knowing nothing.
00:26:18.72 --> 00:26:20.12 No way better too.
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:21.12 Yeah, this.
00:26:21.12 --> 00:26:22.12 Especially that.
00:26:22.12 --> 00:26:23.12 Especially that.
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:24.12 Yeah.
00:26:24.12 --> 00:26:25.12 Good.
00:26:25.12 --> 00:26:26.12 Good after it.
00:26:26.12 --> 00:26:27.12 That's it.
00:26:27.12 --> 00:26:28.12 Next question.
00:26:28.12 --> 00:26:29.12 Jockel.
00:26:29.12 --> 00:26:31.12 Mr. Jockel.
00:26:31.12 --> 00:26:35.64 Whenever I get mentally overwhelmed, I shut down completely.
00:26:35.64 --> 00:26:37.96 How do I counter that?
00:26:37.96 --> 00:26:43.24 Well, the first thing and the first good step that you've already made is you've identified
00:26:43.24 --> 00:26:44.40 this is an issue.
00:26:44.40 --> 00:26:46.36 You recognize the fact that you shut down.
00:26:46.36 --> 00:26:49.32 That's step number one in solving your problems identifying your problem.
00:26:49.32 --> 00:26:51.08 So excellent work there.
00:26:51.08 --> 00:26:53.000 The next step is actually pretty easy as well.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.36 You've identified the fact that you shut down.
00:26:55.36 --> 00:26:59.28 The next step that you're going to do is not shut down.
00:26:59.28 --> 00:27:00.28 Not mentally shut down.
00:27:00.28 --> 00:27:01.60 That's what you want to do.
00:27:01.60 --> 00:27:06.04 If you start to shut down and you feel yourself freezing up, say, I'm not going to shut
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:07.04 down right now.
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:08.44 I'm going to attack this issue.
00:27:08.44 --> 00:27:14.36 Now, the reason that you're getting overwhelmed most likely is because there's a lot
00:27:14.36 --> 00:27:18.80 of different things flying at you at the same time and they're all happening at once.
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:20.36 And it's problematic for you.
00:27:20.36 --> 00:27:21.84 We have a very simple solution for that.
00:27:21.84 --> 00:27:23.36 It's prioritizing execute.
00:27:23.36 --> 00:27:25.96 So what is the biggest problem that you've got going on?
00:27:25.96 --> 00:27:27.96 Let's identify what that biggest problem is.
00:27:27.96 --> 00:27:29.76 Then let's attack that problem and get it solved.
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:31.92 Once we got that one solved, we can move on to the next one.
00:27:31.92 --> 00:27:34.04 Once we get to take care of that one, we can move on to the next one.
00:27:34.04 --> 00:27:36.000 We go right on down the line.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.12 That's what we do.
00:27:39.12 --> 00:27:40.84 That's very simple.
00:27:40.84 --> 00:27:43.72 You know that you're going to get overwhelmed.
00:27:43.72 --> 00:27:46.16 First of all, tell yourself you're not going to go overwhelmed.
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:48.16 Then you actually don't get overwhelmed.
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:49.28 And how do you not get overwhelmed?
00:27:49.28 --> 00:27:53.12 You prioritize an execute.
00:27:53.12 --> 00:27:59.12 If you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, do what I did to the platoon commander
00:27:59.12 --> 00:28:08.08 that I had that was getting all freaked out during a humv, I had just immediate action drills
00:28:08.08 --> 00:28:10.72 where you're patrolling through the desert.
00:28:10.72 --> 00:28:15.24 And we have electrical targets that pop up and then you, everyone starts shooting at the
00:28:15.24 --> 00:28:16.24 targets.
00:28:16.24 --> 00:28:22.16 And this guy was locking up and not making any decisions even though he's the leader.
00:28:22.16 --> 00:28:25.76 And this is the one where I took a magic marker and I wrote on this Sharpie right in front
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:27.88 of his face on the humv window.
00:28:27.88 --> 00:28:31.32 I said, next time the shooting starts, here's what I want you to do.
00:28:31.32 --> 00:28:34.12 Number one, relax.
00:28:34.12 --> 00:28:35.60 Number two, look around.
00:28:35.60 --> 00:28:37.36 Number three, make a call.
00:28:37.36 --> 00:28:38.36 It's really easy.
00:28:38.36 --> 00:28:42.80 So step number one when you're getting overwhelmed, relax.
00:28:42.80 --> 00:28:43.80 Relax.
00:28:43.80 --> 00:28:45.56 Breathe, take a step back.
00:28:45.56 --> 00:28:47.48 Just take a step back.
00:28:47.48 --> 00:28:52.60 The red flags start going off in your head and you're realizing that you're getting overwhelmed
00:28:52.60 --> 00:28:54.12 and you're going to get shut down.
00:28:54.12 --> 00:28:55.12 No.
00:28:55.12 --> 00:29:00.60 Take a step back, relax.
00:29:00.60 --> 00:29:04.08 And then prioritize next Q pretty simple.
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:05.08 Make a call.
00:29:05.08 --> 00:29:06.08 Yeah.
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:07.88 Yeah, it's good.
00:29:07.88 --> 00:29:08.24 Simple.
00:29:08.24 --> 00:29:09.24 Next question.
00:29:09.24 --> 00:29:13.80 Let's do it.
00:29:13.80 --> 00:29:18.08 What technique do you use to not lose your temper with your life?
00:29:18.08 --> 00:29:24.40 Oh, when you know she's wrong and refuses to budge, well this is kind of a, this question
00:29:24.40 --> 00:29:30.32 is actually moved because my life is never wrong.
00:29:30.32 --> 00:29:32.88 So number one, losing your temper.
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:37.32 Losing your temper is weak.
00:29:37.32 --> 00:29:38.32 It's actually weak.
00:29:38.32 --> 00:29:40.12 It's actually weak to lose your temper.
00:29:40.12 --> 00:29:47.64 It actually is a loss of control when you lose your temper and losing control was also
00:29:47.64 --> 00:29:49.20 weak.
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:51.40 So we don't want to lose our temper.
00:29:51.40 --> 00:29:53.92 That's one of our goals.
00:29:53.92 --> 00:29:56.64 So again, just like prioritize next Q, what do you do?
00:29:56.64 --> 00:29:58.72 You start feeling yourself losing your temper.
00:29:58.72 --> 00:29:59.72 Stop.
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:03.28 Take a step back to attach from it, breathe.
00:30:03.28 --> 00:30:07.28 And then you've got to think about the long term victory.
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:09.80 And we've talked about this before.
00:30:09.80 --> 00:30:11.40 We've talked about this before.
00:30:11.40 --> 00:30:20.36 Proving that you're right to your wife is not necessarily the best goal to have.
00:30:20.36 --> 00:30:22.72 What you want to do is you want to.
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:25.76 You want to win the war.
00:30:25.76 --> 00:30:29.20 Not that one battle, but one battle doesn't even matter.
00:30:29.20 --> 00:30:33.32 I mean, what is this stupid argument about anyways?
00:30:33.32 --> 00:30:35.20 It's not about something that matters.
00:30:35.20 --> 00:30:36.20 It isn't.
00:30:36.20 --> 00:30:38.84 I can almost guarantee it's not about something that matters.
00:30:38.84 --> 00:30:44.32 It's about some random thing that doesn't matter in the big picture at all.
00:30:44.32 --> 00:30:48.20 So why are you getting upset about it?
00:30:48.20 --> 00:30:49.20 Why are you losing control?
00:30:49.20 --> 00:30:50.20 Why are you losing your temper?
00:30:50.20 --> 00:30:52.40 You can't do that.
00:30:52.40 --> 00:30:54.40 You can't do that.
00:30:54.40 --> 00:30:59.08 So when you feel like you're coming up against the, this is Sun Siu.
00:30:59.08 --> 00:31:01.48 You're going against a heavily defended position.
00:31:01.48 --> 00:31:04.40 Don't attack the heavily defended position.
00:31:04.40 --> 00:31:07.76 If your wife is not admitting that she's wrong, she's refusing to budge.
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:08.76 What are you doing?
00:31:08.76 --> 00:31:10.40 What are you attacking?
00:31:10.40 --> 00:31:13.12 You're actually attacking a heavily defended position.
00:31:13.12 --> 00:31:14.80 Sun Siu told you not to do that.
00:31:14.80 --> 00:31:18.64 2,500 years ago and it holds two to this day.
00:31:18.64 --> 00:31:20.88 So what are you going to do when they're not budging?
00:31:20.88 --> 00:31:23.16 You're going to flank them.
00:31:23.16 --> 00:31:25.000 You're going to flank them.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.64 You're going to move around to the outside and come in from another angle that they weren't
00:31:29.64 --> 00:31:32.40 expecting.
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:36.64 You know, maybe that other angle looks like flowers.
00:31:36.64 --> 00:31:38.28 Maybe the other angle looks like dinner.
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:41.28 Maybe it looks like maybe it just looks like change in the subject to something that they
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:48.24 can be more flexible mentally on.
00:31:48.24 --> 00:31:55.76 Because if you go against that hardened position, I can almost guarantee you it's not
00:31:55.76 --> 00:31:57.84 going to, they're not going to budge on it.
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:02.56 And all you, what you're going to do to try and get them to budges, you're going to escalate
00:32:02.56 --> 00:32:03.56 yourself.
00:32:03.56 --> 00:32:04.56 Oh, you're not budging.
00:32:04.56 --> 00:32:05.56 They hit it harder.
00:32:05.56 --> 00:32:07.20 Oh, you're still not budging them, but they go even harder.
00:32:07.20 --> 00:32:09.12 You're still not budging them, you're going to go even harder.
00:32:09.12 --> 00:32:11.64 There are that whole time every time you're going harder, they're digging into defenses
00:32:11.64 --> 00:32:14.44 in deeper deeper deeper.
00:32:14.44 --> 00:32:19.80 And they're remembering how, how mean you are or whatever, especially if you're in a
00:32:19.80 --> 00:32:21.16 last-temperature situation.
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:22.16 Oh, yeah.
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:25.72 Now you're now you're taking serious detriment to your long-term war.
00:32:25.72 --> 00:32:26.72 Yeah.
00:32:26.72 --> 00:32:29.56 Because now you've given them ammunition.
00:32:29.56 --> 00:32:31.72 You've given them ammunition for future use.
00:32:31.72 --> 00:32:32.72 Bad move.
00:32:32.72 --> 00:32:34.16 It's a bad move.
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:43.36 So again, what isn't, what, who's right and who's wrong is just not important.
00:32:43.36 --> 00:32:45.16 It's a lot to get through people's head.
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:50.12 Who's right and who's wrong on some little tactical battle of today that really has no
00:32:50.12 --> 00:32:51.92 bearing on anything in the world.
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:55.60 This is not something to be concerned about.
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.68 So it might be your own ego that wants to be right.
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:01.36 Have we thought about that factor?
00:33:01.36 --> 00:33:02.96 Have we thought about that?
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:08.08 You as a man, as a husband, you want to be right to.
00:33:08.08 --> 00:33:10.28 So guess who the person that isn't budged?
00:33:10.28 --> 00:33:12.28 Guess who the person that does is and budging is.
00:33:12.28 --> 00:33:14.16 It's you.
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:15.16 It's you.
00:33:15.16 --> 00:33:20.68 Now you might be quote unquote right, but it doesn't matter you're the person that won't
00:33:20.68 --> 00:33:21.68 budge.
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:22.96 Now neither one of you will budge.
00:33:22.96 --> 00:33:24.52 Neither one of you will budge.
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:26.000 We're not in a good situation.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.12 We're just in an escalating war of destruction.
00:33:31.12 --> 00:33:32.12 And we don't want that.
00:33:32.12 --> 00:33:35.32 Because we want to win the long-term strategic war.
00:33:35.32 --> 00:33:37.08 That's what we're looking at.
00:33:37.08 --> 00:33:39.04 Just the long-term strategic war.
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:42.24 The little stuff in between, we did not concern about.
00:33:42.24 --> 00:33:43.24 Yeah.
00:33:43.24 --> 00:33:44.24 Yeah, fully.
00:33:44.24 --> 00:33:47.96 And the whole not budging thing too.
00:33:47.96 --> 00:33:48.96 Like that hurts.
00:33:48.96 --> 00:33:53.72 And I used to think about this early on in my relationship where I would get, we'd get in
00:33:53.72 --> 00:33:58.000 a little arguments or whatever, varying levels.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.64 And sometimes she would like, what, can you even come up with an example of something
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:05.64 you'd argue about?
00:34:05.64 --> 00:34:08.28 Because as I was trying to think as I was sitting here as I was answering this question,
00:34:08.28 --> 00:34:09.56 I was trying to think of a good example.
00:34:09.56 --> 00:34:11.92 I can't even think of a good example.
00:34:11.92 --> 00:34:12.92 Yeah.
00:34:12.92 --> 00:34:13.92 Because they're all so stupid.
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:14.92 Yeah.
00:34:14.92 --> 00:34:15.92 So yeah, a good example.
00:34:15.92 --> 00:34:16.92 No.
00:34:16.92 --> 00:34:17.92 Yeah.
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:18.92 That's hard.
00:34:18.92 --> 00:34:21.92 Not really.
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.48 But so she would be like, oh, I just don't want to talk about it anymore.
00:34:26.48 --> 00:34:28.92 But meanwhile, I'm still salty.
00:34:28.92 --> 00:34:31.76 Like, hey, we didn't resolve this.
00:34:31.76 --> 00:34:33.76 You know, there's certain code words.
00:34:33.76 --> 00:34:36.000 Like I thought, like a safe word.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.92 That girls that women, that guys have a two, but in particular, I've noticed it with
00:34:39.92 --> 00:34:42.20 some of my friends' wives.
00:34:42.20 --> 00:34:46.76 And one of my wives, she'll say, doesn't, it doesn't matter.
00:34:46.76 --> 00:34:47.76 What do you mean, buzzword?
00:34:47.76 --> 00:34:48.76 Like a code word.
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:49.76 No, it's a safe word.
00:34:49.76 --> 00:34:50.76 It's a red flag.
00:34:50.76 --> 00:34:57.32 So it'll just be a, it'll be a giant red flag that she's, that she's angry.
00:34:57.32 --> 00:35:00.12 She doesn't, nothing I say is going to matter anymore.
00:35:00.12 --> 00:35:01.92 She's not going to change your mind.
00:35:01.92 --> 00:35:02.92 And she's just going to go forward.
00:35:02.92 --> 00:35:04.92 And she'll be like, oh, it doesn't matter.
00:35:04.92 --> 00:35:05.92 I'm like, oh, okay.
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:07.48 We're, morning.
00:35:07.48 --> 00:35:08.48 Yeah.
00:35:08.48 --> 00:35:10.48 They gage his angry.
00:35:10.48 --> 00:35:11.48 That's what it means.
00:35:11.48 --> 00:35:15.12 So when I hear her say, doesn't matter, I just realize, okay, I'm, now I just
00:35:15.12 --> 00:35:18.12 hit a, a heavily defended position.
00:35:18.12 --> 00:35:20.12 And I'm going to stop attacking it.
00:35:20.12 --> 00:35:21.12 I'm going to flank.
00:35:21.12 --> 00:35:23.32 I'm going to talk about something else.
00:35:23.32 --> 00:35:25.52 I'm coming in from the side hatch.
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:26.80 That's what I'm going to do.
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:27.80 Yeah.
00:35:27.80 --> 00:35:31.36 Yeah, man, I wish I would have known that long time ago.
00:35:31.36 --> 00:35:35.24 I think that when, wait, what did you just say that your wife said to you, because you
00:35:35.24 --> 00:35:36.40 just said a code word?
00:35:36.40 --> 00:35:38.24 I mean, uh, up.
00:35:38.24 --> 00:35:39.24 I don't want to talk about it.
00:35:39.24 --> 00:35:40.24 I don't want to go.
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:41.24 There's another one.
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:42.24 Yeah.
00:35:42.24 --> 00:35:43.24 I want to talk about the sets that's a red flag.
00:35:43.24 --> 00:35:45.88 Well, in my mind, it was like, yeah, let's talk about it.
00:35:45.88 --> 00:35:50.000 I, I try it would try to do it in a conducive way, like, you know, like, a problem solving
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000 kind of way.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.40 But she just didn't feel the same way about the whole situation.
00:35:54.40 --> 00:35:56.12 You know, she handles it different.
00:35:56.12 --> 00:36:00.52 And, you know, ultimately, I still feel like if two people are willing to talk it out
00:36:00.52 --> 00:36:04.72 kind of without too much emotion, I think that's an effective way to do it.
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:08.12 But nonetheless, what this would cause is, and this is going back to people not
00:36:08.12 --> 00:36:09.12 a budget.
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:14.88 So what that would cause is all this time that would go on that we're not on good terms,
00:36:14.88 --> 00:36:17.36 you know, because I want to talk about, she doesn't want to talk about it.
00:36:17.36 --> 00:36:20.88 She just wants to, I don't know, go to bed, you know, meanwhile, I am with the philosophy
00:36:20.88 --> 00:36:23.36 of don't go to bed in an argument or whatever, you know.
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:27.000 But meanwhile, we're at odds, even just a little bit.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.72 Even if we don't talk about it, she forgets about it.
00:36:28.72 --> 00:36:29.72 I'm still at odds.
00:36:29.72 --> 00:36:32.40 I'm not budging with my philosophy, you know.
00:36:32.40 --> 00:36:37.40 So at the end of the day, when you look back at all the minutes, all the hours, all
00:36:37.40 --> 00:36:46.96 the days that you've spent with each other, and now you have that, that, that some of
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:50.96 of moments that you're at odds, you look at your relationship, you're like, man, this
00:36:50.96 --> 00:36:55.000 relationship isn't that good, because you spent that much time at odds with each other.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.64 Yeah, just because you didn't want to get in touch.
00:36:57.64 --> 00:36:58.64 Yes.
00:36:58.64 --> 00:37:00.16 So you got a bunch.
00:37:00.16 --> 00:37:01.68 You got a bunch.
00:37:01.68 --> 00:37:06.80 One of my buddies, I was hanging around having this wife and her little buzzword, where
00:37:06.80 --> 00:37:09.88 I was like, oh, I picked up on it pretty quickly.
00:37:09.88 --> 00:37:10.88 She would say, that's fine.
00:37:10.88 --> 00:37:12.88 It's a con.
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:16.48 And I was like, hey, first, you know, first couple of times, I was like, oh, it's fine
00:37:16.48 --> 00:37:17.48 with her.
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:19.48 And then I realized that there's nothing that's fine.
00:37:19.48 --> 00:37:23.80 I think that's kind of a common knowledge, what, what?
00:37:23.80 --> 00:37:24.80 What girls?
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:25.80 You could just let that up.
00:37:25.80 --> 00:37:28.08 Like, no matter, that's fine.
00:37:28.08 --> 00:37:29.08 Whatever.
00:37:29.08 --> 00:37:30.40 Well, whatever is offensive, though.
00:37:30.40 --> 00:37:31.40 Oh, yeah.
00:37:31.40 --> 00:37:34.84 And they know if they say whatever, then that means that's fighting words.
00:37:34.84 --> 00:37:37.56 Because if you'll notice, that's fine.
00:37:37.56 --> 00:37:39.28 And it doesn't matter.
00:37:39.28 --> 00:37:45.20 They are all, they are all, like, sort of passive.
00:37:45.20 --> 00:37:46.20 Yeah.
00:37:46.20 --> 00:37:48.76 The way of saying, like, oh, let's just move on.
00:37:48.76 --> 00:37:49.76 Yeah.
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:50.76 I don't want to talk about it.
00:37:50.76 --> 00:37:51.76 That one's a borderline.
00:37:51.76 --> 00:37:52.76 Yeah.
00:37:52.76 --> 00:37:54.76 Or it's like, or it's like one of the, I don't know.
00:37:54.76 --> 00:37:59.08 So what's good is when you detach from these situations, you start to pick up on
00:37:59.08 --> 00:38:02.04 these things that you're significant other.
00:38:02.04 --> 00:38:05.52 And also, there's, when you're in a relationship, you're in a team building, in
00:38:05.52 --> 00:38:09.48 a team environment, or you're in a business, you start to realize that guys or people
00:38:09.48 --> 00:38:11.60 you work with will have the same thing.
00:38:11.60 --> 00:38:12.60 Yeah.
00:38:12.60 --> 00:38:14.60 Well, let's say, you know what it's your call.
00:38:14.60 --> 00:38:15.60 Okay.
00:38:15.60 --> 00:38:20.96 I know it's my call, but I'm not trying to impose this plan on you.
00:38:20.96 --> 00:38:21.96 Let's figure it out.
00:38:21.96 --> 00:38:22.96 No, it's your call.
00:38:22.96 --> 00:38:23.96 We'll go ahead.
00:38:23.96 --> 00:38:24.96 Yeah.
00:38:24.96 --> 00:38:25.96 So that means you clearly don't agree with it.
00:38:25.96 --> 00:38:27.24 And of course, you can't say this to him, because they're already dug in on the fact
00:38:27.24 --> 00:38:29.24 that you're, you know, that you're wrong.
00:38:29.24 --> 00:38:30.24 Yeah.
00:38:30.24 --> 00:38:31.92 So those are little red flags.
00:38:31.92 --> 00:38:33.60 You got to look out for it in the world.
00:38:33.60 --> 00:38:34.60 Yeah.
00:38:34.60 --> 00:38:35.60 And that's back.
00:38:35.60 --> 00:38:37.48 And that's fun.
00:38:37.48 --> 00:38:43.28 And even that's a complex thing, because you know when someone says, fine, you know,
00:38:43.28 --> 00:38:45.64 what's wrong, what's wrong, nothing, right?
00:38:45.64 --> 00:38:50.68 Oh, you know, or you have reason to believe that it's not fine, especially the
00:38:50.68 --> 00:38:53.20 find or that's fine.
00:38:53.20 --> 00:38:55.32 You have good reason to believe that it's not fine.
00:38:55.32 --> 00:38:56.32 Right.
00:38:56.32 --> 00:39:00.76 So you're not fine.
00:39:00.76 --> 00:39:02.56 It's logical to think, hey, you shouldn't say you're fine when you're not fine.
00:39:02.56 --> 00:39:07.20 You actively chose to say you're fine when you're not fine, factually.
00:39:07.20 --> 00:39:09.76 So it's easy to come to that logical conclusion.
00:39:09.76 --> 00:39:10.76 Yeah.
00:39:10.76 --> 00:39:11.76 But there's your problem.
00:39:11.76 --> 00:39:12.76 Right.
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:13.76 Logical.
00:39:13.76 --> 00:39:15.36 I'm just, you know, it's just, it's not that simple.
00:39:15.36 --> 00:39:16.48 It's not that black and white.
00:39:16.48 --> 00:39:22.96 So I'm saying this because I kind of, up until really recently, I thought that, hey,
00:39:22.96 --> 00:39:24.92 look, I'm not really wrong with this thing.
00:39:24.92 --> 00:39:27.08 I ask you a very specific question.
00:39:27.08 --> 00:39:32.08 If you're saying you're fine, it's like, it doesn't even matter what you say.
00:39:32.08 --> 00:39:37.40 I have to read like your mind or your body language and like everything, you know?
00:39:37.40 --> 00:39:39.80 And disregard your words.
00:39:39.80 --> 00:39:45.76 And only under these circumstances, not when you, when I say, hey, do you need, I don't
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:49.64 know milk from the store, you say no, I know you mean, yeah, you know, it doesn't work
00:39:49.64 --> 00:39:50.64 like that.
00:39:50.64 --> 00:39:52.08 It's only under the circumstance.
00:39:52.08 --> 00:39:55.76 So it's like, and thinking, hey, man, that's kind of, that's not very good.
00:39:55.76 --> 00:39:58.08 That's a bad thing and habit to get in.
00:39:58.08 --> 00:40:00.000 So if you're not fine, you should say, you're not fine.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.32 That's my logic is what I'm saying.
00:40:01.32 --> 00:40:02.52 But here's the thing.
00:40:02.52 --> 00:40:05.88 When you're in a relationship with someone and it starts, I understand it starts at the
00:40:05.88 --> 00:40:07.92 beginning where you're trying to figure all this stuff out.
00:40:07.92 --> 00:40:09.96 That's what the beginning of the relationship for.
00:40:09.96 --> 00:40:12.96 But after a while, you start to know, okay, I know that tone.
00:40:12.96 --> 00:40:14.56 I know when you say fine, it's not fine.
00:40:14.56 --> 00:40:18.84 What the thing that's jacked up is when people don't realize that.
00:40:18.84 --> 00:40:22.08 That's a code word that means something else.
00:40:22.08 --> 00:40:23.08 Right.
00:40:23.08 --> 00:40:27.48 What you're signifying is you are coming up against a heavily defended area.
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:31.68 I'm not changing my mind, but I'm not going to sit here and argue about it.
00:40:31.68 --> 00:40:34.76 So you know what, doesn't matter is what my wife would say.
00:40:34.76 --> 00:40:35.76 Yeah.
00:40:35.76 --> 00:40:36.76 Oh, it doesn't matter.
00:40:36.76 --> 00:40:38.36 Pro men, win matters.
00:40:38.36 --> 00:40:43.76 When, when Sarah would say, I don't want to argue, I don't want to argue about this.
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:44.76 It's, it's fine.
00:40:44.76 --> 00:40:45.76 Let's not talk about it.
00:40:45.76 --> 00:40:47.04 That would encourage me for further.
00:40:47.04 --> 00:40:51.48 But not like, I'm not a loose temper, kind of whatever, but it would frustrate you.
00:40:51.48 --> 00:40:54.68 It would make me, well, I'd be like, no, we have to go to, it's like, you know, if you
00:40:54.68 --> 00:41:02.16 have like, fucking, like a splinter, like you have a splinter in your hand or something,
00:41:02.16 --> 00:41:04.72 not talking about it is like, I just leave it.
00:41:04.72 --> 00:41:07.36 Let the skin grow over it and you'll be fine.
00:41:07.36 --> 00:41:08.60 And the thing is, you probably will be fine.
00:41:08.60 --> 00:41:10.56 But he's still got that splinter in there.
00:41:10.56 --> 00:41:12.04 Me, I'm like, okay, let's talk about this.
00:41:12.04 --> 00:41:16.16 Open it up and get the splinter out.
00:41:16.16 --> 00:41:21.16 But she's like, no, you know, I can't always recommend ripping that splinter out.
00:41:21.16 --> 00:41:28.08 Yeah, and sometimes the, again, you're going up against a hard defensive area.
00:41:28.08 --> 00:41:29.32 That's what we're talking about here.
00:41:29.32 --> 00:41:33.08 That's the question is, the question is, how do you, not lose your temper with your wife
00:41:33.08 --> 00:41:35.72 when you know she's wrong and she refused to punch you.
00:41:35.72 --> 00:41:37.44 No, you don't do it.
00:41:37.44 --> 00:41:39.04 You know how you maintain your temper.
00:41:39.04 --> 00:41:45.84 You realize that you're in a strategic situation where you're just going to win strategically.
00:41:45.84 --> 00:41:47.40 You're going to outsmart.
00:41:47.40 --> 00:41:48.76 You're going to outmaneuver.
00:41:48.76 --> 00:41:50.48 You're going to outmanipulate.
00:41:50.48 --> 00:41:51.48 I'm sorry.
00:41:51.48 --> 00:41:53.08 You're going to manipulate this situation.
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:55.44 That's what you're going to do.
00:41:55.44 --> 00:42:00.44 And you're going to make her think, you know what, man, I was kind of a chair class night
00:42:00.44 --> 00:42:02.40 to my wonderful husband.
00:42:02.40 --> 00:42:03.40 Yeah.
00:42:03.40 --> 00:42:05.40 That's what we're going to have.
00:42:05.40 --> 00:42:07.60 Yeah, you got to do it in this genuine way.
00:42:07.60 --> 00:42:12.60 You know, of course you got to do it in real genuine and open and warm.
00:42:12.60 --> 00:42:17.56 And once I attack you when you're in that state, you know, so that's what you do to me my
00:42:17.56 --> 00:42:18.56 wife.
00:42:18.56 --> 00:42:24.72 No, I'm telling you, maybe if you switch all of a sudden and she's like, hey, this is
00:42:24.72 --> 00:42:25.72 the trick.
00:42:25.72 --> 00:42:29.36 But if you're like, if you put it on, you're just disarming them.
00:42:29.36 --> 00:42:30.36 Right.
00:42:30.36 --> 00:42:31.36 Yes, exactly.
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:32.36 You disarming them.
00:42:32.36 --> 00:42:33.36 But man, it's hard to do when you lose your temper.
00:42:33.36 --> 00:42:36.96 I answered a question the other day, I was out in a van and I answered a question.
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:40.84 I was like, listen, do not take marriage advice for me.
00:42:40.84 --> 00:42:47.04 Because the question, well, it's a long story, but the question was about, you know,
00:42:47.04 --> 00:42:52.96 how do you do your job when you have all this pressure and how do you maintain your family?
00:42:52.96 --> 00:42:57.64 And I kind of went through the story of like, hey, you know, my family came second.
00:42:57.64 --> 00:42:59.40 And that's really hard for people to understand.
00:42:59.40 --> 00:43:00.40 And I went through the whole thing.
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:01.80 And that's what I've got to the end.
00:43:01.80 --> 00:43:05.48 And I said, listen, don't take marriage advice for me.
00:43:05.48 --> 00:43:06.76 And they've kind of laughed.
00:43:06.76 --> 00:43:10.76 But in a situation like this.
00:43:10.76 --> 00:43:12.32 I actually take marriage advice for me.
00:43:12.32 --> 00:43:13.32 Right.
00:43:13.32 --> 00:43:14.32 Yeah.
00:43:14.32 --> 00:43:15.32 Don't attack defended positions.
00:43:15.32 --> 00:43:16.68 I've said that 47 times right now.
00:43:16.68 --> 00:43:17.68 Yeah.
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:20.92 And it's not to say that you've never attacked defended.
00:43:20.92 --> 00:43:23.76 I don't know if you ever have it with your life.
00:43:23.76 --> 00:43:27.000 But I'm just saying that sounds like good objective advice.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000 Yeah.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.60 I don't, I probably haven't done that in so long.
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:34.08 It's like, the tickling, we got to ask on the podcast.
00:43:34.08 --> 00:43:36.12 When was the, we got to ask this on the podcast?
00:43:36.12 --> 00:43:39.88 When is the last time that you were dug in on a position?
00:43:39.88 --> 00:43:41.56 How did you admit that you were wrong?
00:43:41.56 --> 00:43:44.44 And I was like, man, I haven't been dug in on a position in years.
00:43:44.44 --> 00:43:45.68 I don't even remember.
00:43:45.68 --> 00:43:46.68 Yeah.
00:43:46.68 --> 00:43:47.68 So it's the same thing here.
00:43:47.68 --> 00:43:50.32 One of why it's hack my wife in a defended position.
00:43:50.32 --> 00:43:52.60 Something that she's super crazy and passionate about.
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:54.56 I'm not going near that thing.
00:43:54.56 --> 00:43:55.56 Yeah.
00:43:55.56 --> 00:43:56.56 Yeah.
00:43:56.56 --> 00:43:57.56 The losing your temper thing too.
00:43:57.56 --> 00:44:01.88 And I had learned, and I mentioned this before, where I learned about just getting
00:44:01.88 --> 00:44:04.44 mad in general from this book called Mind Games.
00:44:04.44 --> 00:44:05.92 You've seen teeny tiny little book.
00:44:05.92 --> 00:44:07.96 One chapter was not even one page.
00:44:07.96 --> 00:44:10.32 And you're first review on the podcast.
00:44:10.32 --> 00:44:11.52 You can be the reviewer.
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:12.52 Mind games.
00:44:12.52 --> 00:44:16.24 Some of them were like puzzles, you know, to see how your mind works.
00:44:16.24 --> 00:44:19.76 Anyway, but what it did was indicate that was your playing coin fall.
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:20.76 That was fun.
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:21.76 Yeah.
00:44:21.76 --> 00:44:24.60 No, that's price is right.
00:44:24.60 --> 00:44:30.36 Anyway, what it indicated was that losing your temper or having anger issues, anger
00:44:30.36 --> 00:44:35.08 management issues, is what it was, it was a result of low self esteem.
00:44:35.08 --> 00:44:37.08 So exactly right.
00:44:37.08 --> 00:44:40.68 And that's how I always felt when you, you know, in elementary school and to me
00:44:40.68 --> 00:44:44.36 in school when you talk about self esteem or whatever, and slow self esteem, high self
00:44:44.36 --> 00:44:45.36 stuff.
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:47.40 I'm being like man, that's so embarrassing to have low self esteem.
00:44:47.40 --> 00:44:52.12 It was like almost like a pride thing, you know, where I would even if I really felt
00:44:52.12 --> 00:44:57.40 like doing something or whatever, if it indicated, overtly that I had a low self esteem,
00:44:57.40 --> 00:44:58.72 if I didn't, I wouldn't do it.
00:44:58.72 --> 00:45:02.44 It was like really, like do you think that paranoia was caused by a low self esteem?
00:45:02.44 --> 00:45:07.04 In a way, probably because it's like the, you know, this feels switcheru.
00:45:07.04 --> 00:45:14.44 But so now I took that like times two where it said, look, everyone gets angry.
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:19.16 It's a natural part of life, but if you have anger management issues, it is most likely
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:20.52 from the low self esteem.
00:45:20.52 --> 00:45:23.32 So I took that as if I ever get angry, that's low self esteem.
00:45:23.32 --> 00:45:25.92 So man, now it'd be on my mind every single time.
00:45:25.92 --> 00:45:29.04 Where anytime I felt myself getting mad or being like, nope, I don't know low self esteem.
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:32.04 So what that did though is train me and never to lose my temper.
00:45:32.04 --> 00:45:33.04 That's what I felt like.
00:45:33.04 --> 00:45:34.04 I felt like the back.
00:45:34.04 --> 00:45:40.28 I think that's the back, but but anyways, I think that's kind of the thing to check though.
00:45:40.28 --> 00:45:41.56 You know, where?
00:45:41.56 --> 00:45:45.56 Yeah, you're losing your temper all that's just like man, what's up with you?
00:45:45.56 --> 00:45:46.56 You're losing your temper.
00:45:46.56 --> 00:45:47.56 Don't lose your temper.
00:45:47.56 --> 00:45:49.84 That's for sure.
00:45:49.84 --> 00:45:53.20 Hey, you know, that splinter analogy, I gave you a man.
00:45:53.20 --> 00:45:56.88 Bro, I'm telling you, okay, so this one time, and it wasn't me who's Jake.
00:45:56.88 --> 00:45:58.36 He had a splinter, we're young.
00:45:58.36 --> 00:45:59.88 He had a splinter in his hand.
00:45:59.88 --> 00:46:03.000 We were like young, young, like, like five.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.36 I know this because we're living in the specific house that I remember.
00:46:05.36 --> 00:46:07.04 Anyway, he did tell us about that.
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:10.28 Anyway, he had a splinter and it was deep.
00:46:10.28 --> 00:46:12.80 So my mom was like, hey, we got to get it out.
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:15.52 We got to, you know, use a like a tweezers or something.
00:46:15.52 --> 00:46:20.88 He's like, no, no, no, no, he put up this full on what he called it, like a pardon defense.
00:46:20.88 --> 00:46:25.000 We're not getting that splinter out because he's crying, he's scared, you know, all this stuff.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.92 So my mom did was, all right, you know, let's don't take out the splinter.
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:30.84 What he did was wait for him to go to sleep.
00:46:30.84 --> 00:46:34.92 You know, you just take out the splinter, it may or may not hurt for like a second, but it's out.
00:46:34.92 --> 00:46:35.92 Who cares?
00:46:35.92 --> 00:46:39.12 Wait, waited for him to go sleep, like a little nap.
00:46:39.12 --> 00:46:41.84 She goes in their gently, just sticks it out.
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:43.28 Boom, problem solved.
00:46:43.28 --> 00:46:44.28 Splinter.
00:46:44.28 --> 00:46:45.28 Basically mama Charles.
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:45.96 Flank them.
00:46:45.96 --> 00:46:46.64 She flanked him.
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:49.56 Totally flanked them then.
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:51.56 Good job, mom.
00:46:51.56 --> 00:46:54.64 Props to, props to mama Charles.
00:46:54.64 --> 00:46:55.44 Next best.
00:46:55.44 --> 00:46:56.64 Yes, please.
00:46:56.64 --> 00:46:57.64 Good Lord.
00:46:57.64 --> 00:47:05.60 How do you balance loyalty to your workmates and a personal sense of honor with self-interest
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:07.88 when it comes to career progression?
00:47:07.88 --> 00:47:16.96 So this question has is giving the impression that that being loyal to your bros and
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:26.92 being loyal to your workmates and having pride is the opposite of career progression, which
00:47:26.92 --> 00:47:32.72 is actually, I understand where that is coming from, but it's actually does not have to be true.
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:35.32 It does not have to be the way you think.
00:47:35.32 --> 00:47:38.16 The way you get around this is number one, you work hard.
00:47:38.16 --> 00:47:39.40 That's what you do, you work hard.
00:47:39.40 --> 00:47:49.000 And you do a good job, not for promotion, not for self-interest, but to help the team
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000 accomplish the goal.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.76 That's what you should be working hard for.
00:47:51.76 --> 00:47:55.56 That's what you should be doing a good job for.
00:47:55.56 --> 00:47:58.60 And this is something I've said a bunch of times over the years.
00:47:58.60 --> 00:48:03.44 I don't know if I've ever said it on the podcast before, but I should tell my guys, because
00:48:03.44 --> 00:48:11.12 we'd be in some long term administrative, psychological warfare in our community, in the
00:48:11.12 --> 00:48:14.28 seal teams or in our organization.
00:48:14.28 --> 00:48:18.12 And I'd say, look, if we're doing the right thing for the right reason, we're going to
00:48:18.12 --> 00:48:20.12 win in the end.
00:48:20.12 --> 00:48:22.32 And I totally believe that to be true.
00:48:22.32 --> 00:48:29.04 Now for instance, I never really cared about break or being promoted.
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:37.28 Now that being said, I actually did put in an officer package so that I could become an
00:48:37.28 --> 00:48:38.28 officer.
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:39.28 Now why did I do that?
00:48:39.28 --> 00:48:44.08 I didn't do that out of greed or out of hunger for power.
00:48:44.08 --> 00:48:48.76 I did it because I had worked for a prior and listed officer and he made our lives really
00:48:48.76 --> 00:48:50.28 good because he was a really good leader.
00:48:50.28 --> 00:48:51.28 And I said, you know what?
00:48:51.28 --> 00:48:56.56 I'd like to make a bunch of the guys that I know, make 16 guys in a seal between make
00:48:56.56 --> 00:48:57.88 their lives better.
00:48:57.88 --> 00:48:59.80 Maybe I can do that.
00:48:59.80 --> 00:49:01.88 So that's sort of what led me to do it.
00:49:01.88 --> 00:49:06.80 I didn't do it out of out of self-interest and greed.
00:49:06.80 --> 00:49:09.84 I did it to help my bros.
00:49:09.84 --> 00:49:16.32 Now that then once I got promoted, once I became an officer, then I just busted my ass to
00:49:16.32 --> 00:49:17.84 do the best job I could.
00:49:17.84 --> 00:49:24.56 And again, I was never concerned with being promoted, but in order to do a good job,
00:49:24.56 --> 00:49:25.76 guess what I did?
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:27.24 I built relationships.
00:49:27.24 --> 00:49:28.84 I took some hard jobs.
00:49:28.84 --> 00:49:31.40 I followed the rules.
00:49:31.40 --> 00:49:32.88 I supported the chain of command.
00:49:32.88 --> 00:49:34.40 I told the party line.
00:49:34.40 --> 00:49:35.60 Why did I do those things?
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:38.80 Wasn't because I was trying to get promoted because I was trying to do a good job.
00:49:38.80 --> 00:49:44.08 And the more relationships I had and the more respect I had from the chain of command,
00:49:44.08 --> 00:49:46.88 the more power I had to help my guys.
00:49:46.88 --> 00:49:48.28 It wasn't about power for me.
00:49:48.28 --> 00:49:50.76 It was about power for the good of the platoon.
00:49:50.76 --> 00:49:52.48 So I could accomplish it.
00:49:52.48 --> 00:49:57.56 And I knew that I believed in the broad mission that we are doing.
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:02.48 I knew that good order and discipline actually makes troops perform better.
00:50:02.48 --> 00:50:04.08 I knew that.
00:50:04.08 --> 00:50:13.42 And I knew that by following the rules, by supporting the chain of command, I knew that
00:50:13.42 --> 00:50:20.10 towing the part, I knew that those things would build trust in the chain of command.
00:50:20.10 --> 00:50:25.54 And I knew that building trust in the chain of command and being viewed positively from
00:50:25.54 --> 00:50:31.62 up the chain of command meant that I would get more support from the chain of command.
00:50:31.62 --> 00:50:37.90 Which once again, would make it easier for my guys to do their job.
00:50:37.90 --> 00:50:38.90 Because I could get a more gear.
00:50:38.90 --> 00:50:39.90 I could get them.
00:50:39.90 --> 00:50:45.46 And I said they needed, I could actually legitimately protest if something came down the
00:50:45.46 --> 00:50:48.38 pipe that I didn't agree with.
00:50:48.38 --> 00:50:54.34 If I didn't have trust and had build a relationship with my senior officers, how could
00:50:54.34 --> 00:50:56.46 I go back to my say, I don't think we should be doing this.
00:50:56.46 --> 00:50:57.62 They don't know me.
00:50:57.62 --> 00:50:58.98 They don't trust me.
00:50:58.98 --> 00:51:02.78 But when you build that trust, then you can have a more open and honest conversation.
00:51:02.78 --> 00:51:08.86 Which again is only done so that my platoon can have it easier life.
00:51:08.86 --> 00:51:14.06 So they could do their job better because I believed in the mission.
00:51:14.06 --> 00:51:23.78 So everything that I was doing that I was doing to make my platoon have a better go at things.
00:51:23.78 --> 00:51:25.10 Make my platoon more efficient.
00:51:25.10 --> 00:51:27.98 Make my platoon more effective on the battlefield.
00:51:27.98 --> 00:51:32.62 All those things that I was doing, I was doing to make that.
00:51:32.62 --> 00:51:36.90 And low and behold, when you're doing those things, when you're busting your ass, when
00:51:36.90 --> 00:51:41.50 you're trying to make life good for your platoon, so that platoon can more effectively and
00:51:41.50 --> 00:51:46.74 efficiently accomplish its mission on the battlefield, well, guess what?
00:51:46.74 --> 00:51:51.50 Those are aligned with a guy that's working hard in the supporting chain of command.
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:53.70 So I would get rank number one.
00:51:53.70 --> 00:51:54.70 Why?
00:51:54.70 --> 00:51:57.58 Not because I was trying to get promoted and not for self interest.
00:51:57.58 --> 00:52:03.26 It's because I was trying to do a good job from my boys.
00:52:03.26 --> 00:52:15.98 So the bottom line is if you care about doing a good job and the doing things that will
00:52:15.98 --> 00:52:20.62 help you do a good job, again, not for promotion and not for recognition, but to truly
00:52:20.62 --> 00:52:28.50 do a good job, the end result is most likely going to be positive.
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:33.22 Now the caveat to this is, does that mean that you'll be the first person to get promoted?
00:52:33.22 --> 00:52:35.58 No.
00:52:35.58 --> 00:52:38.98 Does it mean that you are guaranteed to get promoted?
00:52:38.98 --> 00:52:40.86 No.
00:52:40.86 --> 00:52:44.94 Some other guy that Brown knows and took all the credit he didn't deserve and stepped on
00:52:44.94 --> 00:52:48.34 of people is back to get to the top.
00:52:48.34 --> 00:52:50.50 He's probably going to get promoted ahead of you.
00:52:50.50 --> 00:52:51.50 He probably is.
00:52:51.50 --> 00:52:53.62 It's okay.
00:52:53.62 --> 00:52:54.62 It's okay.
00:52:54.62 --> 00:52:57.78 I will tell you that that will come back to Hauntim.
00:52:57.78 --> 00:53:02.22 Eventually, maybe not this year, maybe not next year, maybe in five years, people are
00:53:02.22 --> 00:53:04.78 going to see through that eventually.
00:53:04.78 --> 00:53:15.98 And you who's doing the right things for the right reasons, you will win in the end.
00:53:15.98 --> 00:53:21.94 Yeah, and talk about this a lot where if you're doing it just to get the promotion, but
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:23.26 that's they're going to see that.
00:53:23.26 --> 00:53:24.26 They're going to smell it.
00:53:24.26 --> 00:53:25.26 Yeah.
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:28.58 And not only is the boss going to smell it on you.
00:53:28.58 --> 00:53:31.42 I talked about that earlier tonight because if you were going to, if you've
00:53:31.42 --> 00:53:38.54 fallen, like if you've fallen tiered to be the admiral's aid, then that was a total red flag.
00:53:38.54 --> 00:53:39.54 Watch out for this guy.
00:53:39.54 --> 00:53:40.82 Yeah, I see what you do.
00:53:40.82 --> 00:53:42.66 Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.
00:53:42.66 --> 00:53:45.34 You want to be doing the right things for the right reasons.
00:53:45.34 --> 00:53:52.06 And that is how even in the long run you will get the recognition and the promotions
00:53:52.06 --> 00:53:55.14 and the credit that you deserve because why wouldn't you?
00:53:55.14 --> 00:53:57.34 You're a bus and you're asked to do a great job.
00:53:57.34 --> 00:53:59.34 You're going to get, you're going to shine eventually.
00:53:59.34 --> 00:54:05.62 Yeah, man, and if you're focused on doing the best job you can do, that's really the dynamics
00:54:05.62 --> 00:54:07.62 of promotions anyway.
00:54:07.62 --> 00:54:09.58 Yeah, it, it, or should be ideal.
00:54:09.58 --> 00:54:10.58 It should be ideal.
00:54:10.58 --> 00:54:18.54 And over time, it will be because there is somebody that Brown knows is the boss, that
00:54:18.54 --> 00:54:23.42 maneuvers to take these little missions or to do things to get the recognition that
00:54:23.42 --> 00:54:26.10 he's there's a guy that's doing that.
00:54:26.10 --> 00:54:28.66 And they can't get promoted.
00:54:28.66 --> 00:54:33.22 And you got to accept that and not succumb to it, not submit to it.
00:54:33.22 --> 00:54:34.38 Because you don't want to be that guy.
00:54:34.38 --> 00:54:38.58 And the long run, the guy that buss his ass that takes care of his troops that toes the
00:54:38.58 --> 00:54:42.94 party line that does the right things for the right reasons is going to win in the end.
00:54:42.94 --> 00:54:43.94 Yeah.
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:44.94 You got to believe in that.
00:54:44.94 --> 00:54:47.10 Yeah, man, you know, guys do that in Jiu Jitsu, right sometimes.
00:54:47.10 --> 00:54:48.10 No, we talk about that too.
00:54:48.10 --> 00:54:49.10 Where they do.
00:54:49.10 --> 00:54:50.10 They have the wrong mindset.
00:54:50.10 --> 00:54:51.10 They just want that purple belt.
00:54:51.10 --> 00:54:52.10 So that brown belt.
00:54:52.10 --> 00:54:53.10 Whatever.
00:54:53.10 --> 00:54:54.10 Yeah, they want the next belt.
00:54:54.10 --> 00:54:57.10 Well, I want to tap that guy or I want to tap this guy.
00:54:57.10 --> 00:54:58.34 Yeah, those are the wrong reasons.
00:54:58.34 --> 00:55:05.06 Folks, yeah, and if you notice, the guys who are just in it to be the best that they
00:55:05.06 --> 00:55:10.50 can be, you see them asking questions or going over some stuff on their own kind of thing,
00:55:10.50 --> 00:55:13.98 where they do, they just want to learn as much as they can and get good as much as they
00:55:13.98 --> 00:55:14.98 can.
00:55:14.98 --> 00:55:18.58 And in the long run, those are going to be the guys that shine.
00:55:18.58 --> 00:55:19.58 Yeah.
00:55:19.58 --> 00:55:24.22 And then I think that's it's such a huge deal.
00:55:24.22 --> 00:55:27.86 And it goes for Jiu Jitsu or even at work or whatever.
00:55:27.86 --> 00:55:33.26 And if you're the guy who they can see what you're doing and you're kissing ass or
00:55:33.26 --> 00:55:37.50 like the guy, okay, this is one of the most embarrassing things you can do in my opinion,
00:55:37.50 --> 00:55:44.34 in Jiu Jitsu is after a promotion, you didn't get promoted and then you're overtly unhappy
00:55:44.34 --> 00:55:45.34 about it.
00:55:45.34 --> 00:55:50.86 And don't go one step further and say something about, I tapped that guy all the time.
00:55:50.86 --> 00:55:52.06 And he got his belt.
00:55:52.06 --> 00:55:53.66 Ooh, don't ever do it.
00:55:53.66 --> 00:55:54.66 Don't do it.
00:55:54.66 --> 00:55:55.66 Yeah, don't say it.
00:55:55.66 --> 00:55:56.66 Don't do it.
00:55:56.66 --> 00:55:57.66 Yeah.
00:55:57.66 --> 00:56:00.74 Don't think you can ever really live that down.
00:56:00.74 --> 00:56:01.74 Just unnecessary.
00:56:01.74 --> 00:56:04.90 It just shows, hey guys, look at me.
00:56:04.90 --> 00:56:06.38 I'm focused on the wrong thing.
00:56:06.38 --> 00:56:10.70 I'm focused on like wearing a belt rather than my skill.
00:56:10.70 --> 00:56:14.58 You know, I'd rather get a belt and maybe not have the skill.
00:56:14.58 --> 00:56:19.46 I'd rather that than have the skill and maybe not have the belt right now.
00:56:19.46 --> 00:56:20.46 That's what you're saying.
00:56:20.46 --> 00:56:21.46 Oh, yeah.
00:56:21.46 --> 00:56:22.46 Yeah.
00:56:22.46 --> 00:56:23.46 Yeah.
00:56:23.46 --> 00:56:30.46 If you don't have the belt right now, you get the belt.
00:56:30.46 --> 00:56:37.46 You know, that's just part of the, you know what, it could be a long time.
00:56:37.46 --> 00:56:38.46 Yeah.
00:56:38.46 --> 00:56:40.46 And you know what, that's okay.
00:56:40.46 --> 00:56:42.46 Oh, unless you're quiet, they need one.
00:56:42.46 --> 00:56:43.46 Oh, yeah.
00:56:43.46 --> 00:56:44.46 But you won't have the belt.
00:56:44.46 --> 00:56:45.46 But that's the one.
00:56:45.46 --> 00:56:48.46 You've got to also accept the fact that some guys can get promoted at you.
00:56:48.46 --> 00:56:49.46 Good.
00:56:49.46 --> 00:56:51.46 Good thing you good you tapped on before.
00:56:51.46 --> 00:56:52.46 Good.
00:56:52.46 --> 00:56:53.46 That's perfect.
00:56:53.46 --> 00:56:54.46 Keep that up.
00:56:54.46 --> 00:56:55.46 Yeah.
00:56:55.46 --> 00:56:56.46 We're going to get you that belt.
00:56:56.46 --> 00:56:57.46 Yeah, stop whining.
00:56:57.46 --> 00:57:00.46 I heard of a guy who left the gym.
00:57:00.46 --> 00:57:01.46 Yeah.
00:57:01.46 --> 00:57:02.46 Argym.
00:57:02.46 --> 00:57:03.46 Because he didn't get a belt.
00:57:03.46 --> 00:57:05.46 And he was like, oh, I'm just going to go somewhere else.
00:57:05.46 --> 00:57:06.46 Yeah.
00:57:06.46 --> 00:57:07.46 That's too bad.
00:57:07.46 --> 00:57:08.46 Yeah.
00:57:08.46 --> 00:57:09.46 I just heard he was a story.
00:57:09.46 --> 00:57:11.46 I wasn't there enough.
00:57:11.46 --> 00:57:12.46 Anyway.
00:57:12.46 --> 00:57:14.46 Next question.
00:57:14.46 --> 00:57:15.46 Unless we have more on that one.
00:57:15.46 --> 00:57:16.46 No.
00:57:16.46 --> 00:57:17.46 We're good.
00:57:17.46 --> 00:57:19.46 Dead horse has been beaten.
00:57:19.46 --> 00:57:20.46 Yeah.
00:57:20.46 --> 00:57:21.46 Don't be that guy, man.
00:57:21.46 --> 00:57:22.46 Yeah.
00:57:22.46 --> 00:57:25.46 Chaco on team building.
00:57:25.46 --> 00:57:34.46 When leading a team, do you feel that there's any benefit to team building exercises or retreats?
00:57:34.46 --> 00:57:42.46 Well, this is a interesting question that actually I feel unfairly qualified to answer
00:57:42.46 --> 00:57:44.46 because we, we lay for an eye.
00:57:44.46 --> 00:57:50.46 We have a little business called echelon front where that's, we work with a lot of different companies on a different
00:57:50.46 --> 00:57:53.46 side range of different categories.
00:57:53.46 --> 00:57:55.46 Sometimes we go in and work with a business.
00:57:55.46 --> 00:57:58.46 Sometimes we're going to do a keynote speech for a business.
00:57:58.46 --> 00:58:04.74 Like they'll be having a big meeting and we're going to do one keynote speech for an hour
00:58:04.74 --> 00:58:06.46 and we leave and we're done.
00:58:06.46 --> 00:58:11.18 But most of the time we're doing more long range stuff or we spend time with the company
00:58:11.18 --> 00:58:12.18 we go in.
00:58:12.18 --> 00:58:19.70 But oftentimes we do do some kind of situation where their company has decided to do some
00:58:19.70 --> 00:58:25.70 kind of a leadership off-site or a team building exercise or a leadership retreat.
00:58:25.70 --> 00:58:31.14 And we mostly get involved with the leadership although that does sometimes trickle down
00:58:31.14 --> 00:58:36.50 to where we'll do some work with all the front line troops.
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:43.14 So we constantly see these, these leadership off-sites and we speak and or lead them.
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:48.70 Sometimes we run the whole thing and there are definitely some outstanding events.
00:58:48.70 --> 00:58:54.10 And we've participated in and led some outstanding events with companies.
00:58:54.10 --> 00:59:00.18 And I think one of the most important things about these off-sites is it forces the leadership
00:59:00.18 --> 00:59:04.30 team to detach from the day to day firefights of what the business is.
00:59:04.30 --> 00:59:08.94 No matter what, there's no businesses where the CEO and the C-suite are like sitting around
00:59:08.94 --> 00:59:10.34 not doing anything.
00:59:10.34 --> 00:59:14.46 Those companies don't exist, at least that I've seen.
00:59:14.46 --> 00:59:15.46 You're trying to expand.
00:59:15.46 --> 00:59:16.46 You're trying to grow.
00:59:16.46 --> 00:59:18.70 You've got competitors making moves.
00:59:18.70 --> 00:59:22.06 So you're in the fight and then you've got operational things that are happening.
00:59:22.06 --> 00:59:23.06 So you're in the fight.
00:59:23.06 --> 00:59:27.62 So when you do these leadership off-sites, it's good that you get them to focus on some
00:59:27.62 --> 00:59:32.98 other development and some whatever issues they're having and areas where they can improve.
00:59:32.98 --> 00:59:36.78 So it gives them the opportunity to focus on those things.
00:59:36.78 --> 00:59:45.06 And also gives them the opportunity to self-assess as a team, how they're doing and themselves
00:59:45.06 --> 00:59:49.22 as leaders, how they're doing.
00:59:49.22 --> 00:59:55.22 And when I talk to people about leadership and teamwork and the shortfalls and the pitfalls
00:59:55.22 --> 01:00:00.38 that exist and then when they hear me talk about it, they recognize their own weaknesses.
01:00:00.38 --> 01:00:05.30 Every time I get done they go, man, when you were talking about, you know, when you were
01:00:05.30 --> 01:00:09.74 talking about ego, sometimes I think I let my ego get in the way or the way when you were
01:00:09.74 --> 01:00:13.22 talking about cover movement, I don't think I, when you're talking about ownership,
01:00:13.22 --> 01:00:20.02 they see areas of their own weaknesses and they see where they can improve.
01:00:20.02 --> 01:00:24.74 And then when you get the whole team that's all learning that same information, they're
01:00:24.74 --> 01:00:27.98 all doing that same self-assessment.
01:00:27.98 --> 01:00:35.38 And then the whole leadership team gets aligned behind the same leadership principles of
01:00:35.38 --> 01:00:38.14 ownership and humility and cover movement.
01:00:38.14 --> 01:00:42.30 Simple decentralized command and all those things that I talk about, that is extremely
01:00:42.30 --> 01:00:43.30 powerful.
01:00:43.30 --> 01:00:46.90 It is extremely powerful.
01:00:46.90 --> 01:00:53.82 And we see really drastic turnaround with the companies that we work with and it's awesome.
01:00:53.82 --> 01:00:55.22 It's awesome to see.
01:00:55.22 --> 01:01:00.46 And then one thing that we do when we work more in depth with the company, we do our
01:01:00.46 --> 01:01:05.54 own leadership offsights where we do simulated combat.
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:10.34 And I know it sounds, it sounds, if I wouldn't have done it so many times, I would be
01:01:10.34 --> 01:01:12.66 surprised that it's possible.
01:01:12.66 --> 01:01:19.78 But we take either paint guns, paint ball guns or airsoft guns and we teach them the basic
01:01:19.78 --> 01:01:23.54 shooting principles and we teach them some basic small unit tactics.
01:01:23.54 --> 01:01:24.90 And then we go and perform missions.
01:01:24.90 --> 01:01:26.34 We have them perform missions.
01:01:26.34 --> 01:01:30.94 And every time they got eight guys, they got 10 guys, they got 12 guys, girls, whatever
01:01:30.94 --> 01:01:34.90 in their group and they go in a salt attack.
01:01:34.90 --> 01:01:36.38 They come up with a plan.
01:01:36.38 --> 01:01:37.38 They go out.
01:01:37.38 --> 01:01:39.74 We put one person in charge.
01:01:39.74 --> 01:01:41.54 That person has to lead a mission.
01:01:41.54 --> 01:01:49.62 And they what they theorized in the classroom, they now get to put to the test and they
01:01:49.62 --> 01:01:52.62 learn those lessons very, very clearly.
01:01:52.62 --> 01:01:57.38 You know, we'd see a guy that would be a really strong leader.
01:01:57.38 --> 01:02:00.06 And he was, okay, I'm in charge this run.
01:02:00.06 --> 01:02:01.06 Here's what I'm going to do.
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:02.06 Here's the way the plan is.
01:02:02.06 --> 01:02:03.06 Put down.
01:02:03.06 --> 01:02:04.06 You're going to do this.
01:02:04.06 --> 01:02:05.06 You're going to do this.
01:02:05.06 --> 01:02:06.70 You see that micro management start.
01:02:06.70 --> 01:02:11.66 And then as soon as they start the operation, everyone is expecting to get micro managed.
01:02:11.66 --> 01:02:13.02 So no one's thinking on their own.
01:02:13.02 --> 01:02:16.22 So now you get to decentralize a lack of decentralized command.
01:02:16.22 --> 01:02:18.22 And everything goes sideways and nobody does anything.
01:02:18.22 --> 01:02:21.02 Because I'll be waiting to be told what to do.
01:02:21.02 --> 01:02:26.86 So that's an example of the kind of things that people learn.
01:02:26.86 --> 01:02:30.42 So with all that, yes, absolutely.
01:02:30.42 --> 01:02:35.90 We, you know, I've been to and we run some pretty awesome team building exercises and
01:02:35.90 --> 01:02:39.78 retreats and leadership off sites that are better great.
01:02:39.78 --> 01:02:43.66 And we've seen awesome results from a wall.
01:02:43.66 --> 01:02:50.14 I've also sat through some off sites that are not that effective.
01:02:50.14 --> 01:02:53.66 You know, you get situations where people don't open up or there's no exchange.
01:02:53.66 --> 01:02:57.78 Or you get these team building exercises that some people set up.
01:02:57.78 --> 01:03:02.02 And there's some kind of physical or mental challenge.
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:09.54 And while they might be hard and they might take some teamwork to perform, they don't break
01:03:09.54 --> 01:03:12.10 the paradigm that the company is in.
01:03:12.10 --> 01:03:16.98 So then when the bleeding through that challenge, or whatever it is, whether it's a,
01:03:16.98 --> 01:03:20.98 some kind of a p-teats, some kind of physical training, or some kind of a boat race, or
01:03:20.98 --> 01:03:24.70 something like that, they'll lead through that challenge the way they always lead the way
01:03:24.70 --> 01:03:25.70 they currently lead.
01:03:25.70 --> 01:03:29.78 So nothing has learned and nothing has gained and no leadership advancement has been made.
01:03:29.78 --> 01:03:35.70 And all they've done is actually, all they've actually done is reinforce the bad leadership
01:03:35.70 --> 01:03:38.94 situation that they already have.
01:03:38.94 --> 01:03:44.02 So that's one of the things that I've seen that can be problematic.
01:03:44.02 --> 01:03:47.18 And that's why we've gone to the direction that we go.
01:03:47.18 --> 01:03:55.10 Where we really focus on, let's look at leadership and the team working together, how what
01:03:55.10 --> 01:03:59.58 the leadership dynamics are, what are weaknesses are, what we see, where we uncover the
01:03:59.58 --> 01:04:03.42 friction, where we see the team not working well together, where we see the leaders not
01:04:03.42 --> 01:04:07.26 stepping up and leading, where we see the leaders' ego is getting away.
01:04:07.26 --> 01:04:10.86 I mean, there's so many things that we uncover and find.
01:04:10.86 --> 01:04:14.70 It's phenomenal and it really does make it fun for us.
01:04:14.70 --> 01:04:23.10 Because every time you see a new leadership team, it's like diagnosing a patient.
01:04:23.10 --> 01:04:25.98 And you look at the problems that they're having, they say, oh, well, you know what?
01:04:25.98 --> 01:04:27.22 Try this over here.
01:04:27.22 --> 01:04:31.14 Like this off a little bit, and the next thing, you've got that patient up and running
01:04:31.14 --> 01:04:32.70 and they're winning.
01:04:32.70 --> 01:04:34.70 We're like a mechanic.
01:04:34.70 --> 01:04:35.70 We grab the car right?
01:04:35.70 --> 01:04:36.70 Yeah.
01:04:36.70 --> 01:04:37.70 Thoughts.
01:04:37.70 --> 01:04:41.62 Yeah, some of those leadership are not leadership necessarily, but these team building
01:04:41.62 --> 01:04:46.66 retreats to sometimes it seems like whoever organized them really wasn't focusing on
01:04:46.66 --> 01:04:47.66 results.
01:04:47.66 --> 01:04:51.42 They were just focusing on our annual retreat.
01:04:51.42 --> 01:04:57.18 So they make it in the Bahamas and all these activities are kind of fun.
01:04:57.18 --> 01:05:00.26 And everyone's an all-infinite, a administrative thing or something.
01:05:00.26 --> 01:05:01.94 Yeah, and fun can be part of it.
01:05:01.94 --> 01:05:03.66 There's bonding that happens.
01:05:03.66 --> 01:05:07.50 There's getting to know each other and that's always positive.
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:10.82 But if you're, I'm all about having fun.
01:05:10.82 --> 01:05:13.98 I'm all about bonding, but I'm even more about learning.
01:05:13.98 --> 01:05:22.38 I'm even more about improving the people we work with, the guys and girls that we work with.
01:05:22.38 --> 01:05:24.42 I want them to be better of leaders.
01:05:24.42 --> 01:05:25.42 Right.
01:05:25.42 --> 01:05:26.42 That's what I want.
01:05:26.42 --> 01:05:27.14 Yeah, that's what I want.
01:05:27.14 --> 01:05:32.38 So yeah, sure, do I want them to get some team challenges?
01:05:32.38 --> 01:05:36.50 Yes, but like I said, I don't want that just reinforce the paradigm of the third
01:05:36.50 --> 01:05:39.82 already and the leadership paradigm of the third already in.
01:05:39.82 --> 01:05:41.62 I want them to improve.
01:05:41.62 --> 01:05:50.34 So let's actually break down and look and analyze and diagnose what the issues are.
01:05:50.34 --> 01:05:51.78 And then let's solve.
01:05:51.78 --> 01:05:57.74 And you know, it's not always, it's not always that these teams go in and they're, you
01:05:57.74 --> 01:06:00.18 know, we don't get hired by companies that are failing.
01:06:00.18 --> 01:06:04.48 In fact, most of the time, we get hired by companies that are doing well, that want to do
01:06:04.48 --> 01:06:05.48 better.
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:13.14 So when I say we diagnose what the problem is, it's not a problem where it's causing the
01:06:13.14 --> 01:06:18.14 company to failure, but it's a friction point where it is holding the company back from
01:06:18.14 --> 01:06:24.50 really reaching the best, the next level and going from being a really good company or
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:28.38 even an outstanding company to the best in class company.
01:06:28.38 --> 01:06:29.54 Gotcha.
01:06:29.54 --> 01:06:33.46 So it's like a multi-vitamin, not a pink killer.
01:06:33.46 --> 01:06:34.46 Yes.
01:06:34.46 --> 01:06:36.66 You know, that's not my another.
01:06:36.66 --> 01:06:38.46 I read that somewhere.
01:06:38.46 --> 01:06:40.06 You know, the micromanaging thing.
01:06:40.06 --> 01:06:41.06 Yes.
01:06:41.06 --> 01:06:46.14 And that's, it's funny because you're the first person that I've heard say that this, where
01:06:46.14 --> 01:06:48.10 you said, those start micromanaging.
01:06:48.10 --> 01:06:53.26 And then all of a sudden, the people getting micromanaged, expect to get micromanaged, so
01:06:53.26 --> 01:06:54.26 they stop thinking, right?
01:06:54.26 --> 01:06:55.26 100%.
01:06:55.26 --> 01:06:56.86 So yeah, that happens all the way.
01:06:56.86 --> 01:06:58.90 And it goes the other way, too.
01:06:58.90 --> 01:07:01.14 If you come to me and you say, hey, Jockel, how do you want me to do this?
01:07:01.14 --> 01:07:03.34 And I go, figure it out.
01:07:03.34 --> 01:07:04.98 And you say, hey, boss, can you show me how to do this?
01:07:04.98 --> 01:07:06.62 I say, figure it out.
01:07:06.62 --> 01:07:11.34 When we get in the field, you're going to know that I expect you to figure it out.
01:07:11.34 --> 01:07:12.34 Right.
01:07:12.34 --> 01:07:13.34 Yeah, man.
01:07:13.34 --> 01:07:18.06 Like when I, when I drive with my life, she'll start micromanaging like how I drive.
01:07:18.06 --> 01:07:25.86 Like get in this lane or, you know, just, you're going to slow or too fast, whatever,
01:07:25.86 --> 01:07:26.86 too slow typically.
01:07:26.86 --> 01:07:27.86 Yeah, it's cold.
01:07:27.86 --> 01:07:28.86 But here's the thing.
01:07:28.86 --> 01:07:30.86 I'm not going to lose my temper.
01:07:30.86 --> 01:07:34.98 You know, I don't think, yeah, front seat in her case, but yeah, man, for sure.
01:07:34.98 --> 01:07:37.66 And I'm not going to lose my temper, I'll be like, okay, but that's what I do.
01:07:37.66 --> 01:07:39.38 I shut down my brain.
01:07:39.38 --> 01:07:44.26 And then so one time Jada was riding with us and he was, uh, now he was actually
01:07:44.26 --> 01:07:46.10 I was micromanaging Jade.
01:07:46.10 --> 01:07:48.42 And he put it in these good terms, which I thought were good.
01:07:48.42 --> 01:07:54.66 He said either be the navigator, 100% because he stopped thinking, you know, or don't
01:07:54.66 --> 01:07:55.66 be it at all.
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:58.86 You can't just start chiming in when you think I'm going to slow.
01:07:58.86 --> 01:08:03.46 You know, otherwise, yeah, I don't want to, I'm, if Sarah's yelling at me, hey, you're
01:08:03.46 --> 01:08:06.26 going too slow, I'm going to be like, okay, how fast you want me to go?
01:08:06.26 --> 01:08:07.98 I'll go that fast.
01:08:07.98 --> 01:08:12.42 So if you're navigating on the map, you're going to have to tell me every turn to make.
01:08:12.42 --> 01:08:13.98 Don't say, hey, you're going to make this right.
01:08:13.98 --> 01:08:14.98 And then I make the right thing.
01:08:14.98 --> 01:08:18.90 Just sign off, you know, because you're anticipating the micromanage.
01:08:18.90 --> 01:08:19.90 Exactly right, man.
01:08:19.90 --> 01:08:23.62 And I think it kind of goes automatically, you know, you got to put in a lot of
01:08:23.62 --> 01:08:26.50 methods for where you knew that Sarah never said anything.
01:08:26.50 --> 01:08:27.34 You and you got in the car.
01:08:27.34 --> 01:08:30.98 All me, you know that you had to have the route prepped before you got in the vehicle.
01:08:30.98 --> 01:08:34.78 Well, we might go a little bit too slow, but still, man, what it's all me is first thinking
01:08:34.78 --> 01:08:38.42 goes, yeah, man, don't micromanage.
01:08:38.42 --> 01:08:44.66 Or when you micromanage don't expect them to just all of a sudden start making creative
01:08:44.66 --> 01:08:45.66 decisions.
01:08:45.66 --> 01:08:50.30 It's just hard, it's hard for it to work that way, man.
01:08:50.30 --> 01:08:52.70 All right, next question.
01:08:52.70 --> 01:08:54.70 This is the last one.
01:08:54.70 --> 01:09:06.34 Joko, could you tell us any possible regrets or things you'd done differently?
01:09:06.34 --> 01:09:13.26 Something you'd wished you'd learned sooner?
01:09:13.26 --> 01:09:23.18 That's things I could have done differently, things I wish I learned sooner.
01:09:23.18 --> 01:09:27.74 Of course, there are things I wish I learned sooner.
01:09:27.74 --> 01:09:38.70 There's so much knowledge out there, so much information, so many ways to get better.
01:09:38.70 --> 01:09:45.02 So we make, we make so many mistakes.
01:09:45.02 --> 01:09:48.94 We're the product of our mistakes.
01:09:48.94 --> 01:09:55.66 And oftentimes, the lesson is sitting there right in front of our face.
01:09:55.66 --> 01:09:59.90 It's there to be learned, but we miss it and we don't pay attention to it or we think
01:09:59.90 --> 01:10:11.50 we know better until it punches us in the face.
01:10:11.50 --> 01:10:17.78 And the most important thing to learn is that we have so much to learn.
01:10:17.78 --> 01:10:19.38 We all do.
01:10:19.38 --> 01:10:30.50 And we can learn from school and from people and from experience and we learn from life.
01:10:30.50 --> 01:10:34.50 But you have to process the information.
01:10:34.50 --> 01:10:35.90 You have to absorb it.
01:10:35.90 --> 01:10:37.62 You have to accept it.
01:10:37.62 --> 01:10:40.26 You have to open your mind.
01:10:40.26 --> 01:10:49.34 You've got to free your mind so that you can learn and make real progress.
01:10:49.34 --> 01:11:02.78 And as far as regrets and things I wish I would have done differently, of course.
01:11:02.78 --> 01:11:09.58 Hindsight is 2020 and looking back, of course, who wouldn't want to take another go
01:11:09.58 --> 01:11:15.54 with something and improve on the first try by doing it again.
01:11:15.54 --> 01:11:22.54 And why not do it again and again and again and why not just do it over and over again until
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:28.78 you have it perfect.
01:11:28.78 --> 01:11:35.38 But the fact is you don't get that chance.
01:11:35.38 --> 01:11:38.50 You get one shot.
01:11:38.50 --> 01:11:42.50 One shot at this gig right here.
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:45.82 One life.
01:11:45.82 --> 01:11:48.62 That's all you've got.
01:11:48.62 --> 01:11:50.62 And regret.
01:11:50.62 --> 01:11:56.42 And in of itself, it's worthless.
01:11:56.42 --> 01:11:58.58 It does nothing for you.
01:11:58.58 --> 01:12:05.82 In fact, the only valuable thing in regret is the lesson you learned.
01:12:05.82 --> 01:12:10.30 The knowledge that you gained.
01:12:10.30 --> 01:12:14.30 But walking around filled with regret.
01:12:14.30 --> 01:12:18.30 Get you nothing.
01:12:18.30 --> 01:12:22.70 So learn and move on.
01:12:22.70 --> 01:12:24.54 Don't let regret.
01:12:24.54 --> 01:12:25.54 Be chewed down.
01:12:25.54 --> 01:12:27.74 Don't be a slave to regret.
01:12:27.74 --> 01:12:29.74 No.
01:12:29.74 --> 01:12:31.22 Let it teach you.
01:12:31.22 --> 01:12:36.30 Let it make you better.
01:12:36.30 --> 01:12:42.78 Let the fear of regret fuel you to take action today.
01:12:42.78 --> 01:12:52.58 Now to take action now to become a better person.
01:12:52.58 --> 01:12:57.02 Not filled with regret.
01:12:57.02 --> 01:13:03.66 But filled with knowledge.
01:13:03.66 --> 01:13:18.86 And strength and power and filled with life.
01:13:18.86 --> 01:13:25.54 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:13:25.54 --> 01:13:28.54 No regrets.
01:13:28.54 --> 01:13:38.54 Not only knowledge.
01:13:38.54 --> 01:13:39.26 And that's what we are striving for on this podcast to gain knowledge.
01:13:39.26 --> 01:13:43.74 So we can improve ourselves and live better lives.

01:15:00.86 --> 01:15:01.86 impressive.
01:15:01.86 --> 01:15:03.06 That's much appreciated.
01:15:03.06 --> 01:15:07.30 Yeah, so if you're buying some duct tape or some the key the challenge is remembering
01:15:07.30 --> 01:15:08.30 to go.
01:15:08.30 --> 01:15:09.30 Right.
01:15:09.30 --> 01:15:11.14 The jockelpodcast.com.
01:15:11.14 --> 01:15:12.50 Why would you say duct tape?
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:14.70 Do you get a lot of duct tape from Amazon?
01:15:14.70 --> 01:15:17.18 No, I've gotten, yeah.
01:15:17.18 --> 01:15:20.26 You always say if you need duct tape man go to Amazon.
01:15:20.26 --> 01:15:23.94 Well I said it once and it kind of stuck duct tape.
01:15:23.94 --> 01:15:24.94 It.
01:15:24.94 --> 01:15:28.38 Anyway, I saw you watch when Guy wrote, actually I still watch when Guy wrote all the
01:15:28.38 --> 01:15:29.38 time.
01:15:29.38 --> 01:15:30.38 That was his thing, that duct tape.
01:15:30.38 --> 01:15:31.38 Yeah.
01:15:31.38 --> 01:15:32.38 Don't go anywhere without it.
01:15:32.38 --> 01:15:35.26 In the military we call it rigor tape.
01:15:35.26 --> 01:15:36.26 Yeah.
01:15:36.26 --> 01:15:40.90 And some people call it 120 mile an hour tape but I never called it that one time.
01:15:40.90 --> 01:15:42.42 But we call it rigor tape.
01:15:42.42 --> 01:15:43.42 Yeah.
01:15:43.42 --> 01:15:44.42 Yeah.
01:15:44.42 --> 01:15:47.30 I got some black rigor tape.
01:15:47.30 --> 01:15:52.06 On the last, if you're getting some or anything on Amazon.com just try if you can just
01:15:52.06 --> 01:15:54.22 remember to go to jockelpodcast.com first.
01:15:54.22 --> 01:15:59.42 Click on the Amazon link in booms, automatic supporting podcast and we thank you for that.
01:15:59.42 --> 01:16:02.42 I think for that jockel thing to do.
01:16:02.42 --> 01:16:09.70 And while you're at jockel store if you like any of the shirts, go ahead grab one or
01:16:09.70 --> 01:16:11.46 a coffee mug or a sticker.
01:16:11.46 --> 01:16:12.86 That's a good way to support.
01:16:12.86 --> 01:16:16.42 This shirt that you're wearing tonight is a little bit new isn't it?
01:16:16.42 --> 01:16:17.42 It's a little new.
01:16:17.42 --> 01:16:18.42 Yes, the newest one.
01:16:18.42 --> 01:16:19.78 It's all looks very dare.
01:16:19.78 --> 01:16:22.54 If you're watching on YouTube.
01:16:22.54 --> 01:16:27.66 If you're not watching on YouTube, the front of the shirt, it's a black on black shirt.
01:16:27.66 --> 01:16:28.66 Yeah.
01:16:28.66 --> 01:16:32.34 And then the black on the front it says, know the darkness.
01:16:32.34 --> 01:16:35.78 You know, actually ironically if you're watching on YouTube, you might not even be able
01:16:35.78 --> 01:16:38.42 to see know the darkness.
01:16:38.42 --> 01:16:42.70 And let's say and I mentioned this before this when we made this one, there's that added
01:16:42.70 --> 01:16:44.42 layer where it's dark.
01:16:44.42 --> 01:16:45.42 The shirt is for you.
01:16:45.42 --> 01:16:47.42 It's not to show everyone.
01:16:47.42 --> 01:16:48.42 Oh, look at me.
01:16:48.42 --> 01:16:49.42 Look at my cool shirt.
01:16:49.42 --> 01:16:50.42 The shirt is for you.
01:16:50.42 --> 01:16:51.42 You know it's there.
01:16:51.42 --> 01:16:52.42 And on the back it's got some madness.
01:16:52.42 --> 01:16:53.42 Some darkness.
01:16:53.42 --> 01:16:54.42 Some dark.
01:16:54.42 --> 01:16:55.42 It's dark.
01:16:55.42 --> 01:16:56.42 Yeah.
01:16:56.42 --> 01:17:00.42 So that's what you do the shirts, right?
01:17:00.42 --> 01:17:02.42 I mean, so this must, what did that?
01:17:02.42 --> 01:17:05.42 Well, like, we've talked about a lot of stuff.
01:17:05.42 --> 01:17:07.42 Why did you, why did you go with the darkness?
01:17:07.42 --> 01:17:09.42 Why did you, why was that important to you?
01:17:09.42 --> 01:17:11.42 Because that was the main theme.
01:17:11.42 --> 01:17:14.42 Remember like when you, when you started it or what?
01:17:14.42 --> 01:17:15.42 Yeah.
01:17:15.42 --> 01:17:16.42 Well, okay.
01:17:16.42 --> 01:17:20.82 When Jockel started the main theme and still is the main theme where it goes into all
01:17:20.82 --> 01:17:25.22 these dark books and concepts.
01:17:25.22 --> 01:17:30.02 And then every time, even Tim Kennedy, when we asked him, oh, or one of the questions was like,
01:17:30.02 --> 01:17:34.30 hey, how do you, you know, reconcile, you know, being happier, anything that when you
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:36.50 see so much darkness.
01:17:36.50 --> 01:17:42.18 And it actually intensifies your happiness because you can recognize the good stuff.
01:17:42.18 --> 01:17:46.74 So, know the darkness so you can see the light.
01:17:46.74 --> 01:17:48.74 That's kind of the phrase there, right?
01:17:48.74 --> 01:17:51.74 So you can appreciate good things way more when you know bad things.
01:17:51.74 --> 01:17:53.98 And that goes for everything, really.
01:17:53.98 --> 01:17:59.38 So you didn't make a sure that said, be happy.
01:17:59.38 --> 01:18:02.78 The light is with us because you could have made that, I guess.
01:18:02.78 --> 01:18:03.78 Yeah.
01:18:03.78 --> 01:18:06.82 Kind of inconsistent though with the whole feel.
01:18:06.82 --> 01:18:08.06 I mean.
01:18:08.06 --> 01:18:12.82 And the bottom line is if you're surrounded by all the happiness, it starts to fade.
01:18:12.82 --> 01:18:13.82 Right?
01:18:13.82 --> 01:18:14.82 Yeah.
01:18:14.82 --> 01:18:15.82 Yeah.
01:18:15.82 --> 01:18:16.82 Exactly.
01:18:16.82 --> 01:18:17.82 So, will us not make a happy shirt?
01:18:17.82 --> 01:18:18.82 Let's make a dark shirt.
01:18:18.82 --> 01:18:19.82 Yeah.
01:18:19.82 --> 01:18:21.10 Maybe we'll make a happy shirt in the future.
01:18:21.10 --> 01:18:24.70 But I'm saying, for right now, that's where you were feeling.
01:18:24.70 --> 01:18:25.70 That's what it's feeling.
01:18:25.70 --> 01:18:26.70 Yeah.
01:18:26.70 --> 01:18:27.70 I thought it was appropriate.
01:18:27.70 --> 01:18:29.70 I think it came out good, man.
01:18:29.70 --> 01:18:30.70 I dig it.
01:18:30.70 --> 01:18:32.70 There you go.
01:18:32.70 --> 01:18:35.14 Or if you like any of the other ones, just plenty of cool freedom.
01:18:35.14 --> 01:18:36.14 That was a cool one too.
01:18:36.14 --> 01:18:37.14 I think.
01:18:37.14 --> 01:18:37.14 Yeah.
01:18:37.14 --> 01:18:39.82 I don't know what you're at on it.
01:18:39.82 --> 01:18:41.10 Anyway, that you can see on whatever.
01:18:41.10 --> 01:18:46.86 I still haven't seen a live in the wild.
01:18:46.86 --> 01:18:49.18 I haven't seen travel all the time.
01:18:49.18 --> 01:18:51.22 I haven't seen it a trooper yet.
01:18:51.22 --> 01:18:52.86 Just represent.
01:18:52.86 --> 01:18:53.86 Yeah.
01:18:53.86 --> 01:18:55.46 I mean, so, so forward to it.
01:18:55.46 --> 01:18:56.46 Yeah.
01:18:56.46 --> 01:19:00.10 I've never, I've never, I've taken a selfie.
01:19:00.10 --> 01:19:01.46 But I think I might do a selfie.
01:19:01.46 --> 01:19:07.10 If I see a person in the wild trooper out there, just represent in hardcore and
01:19:07.10 --> 01:19:11.18 an airport somewhere, coming straight up, we're gonna do some burpees and then see.
01:19:11.18 --> 01:19:16.02 You know what, yeah, but I've seen them here.
01:19:16.02 --> 01:19:17.02 Yeah, and San Diego.
01:19:17.02 --> 01:19:18.62 But those are our people.
01:19:18.62 --> 01:19:19.62 We know everybody.
01:19:19.62 --> 01:19:22.42 Yeah, but I've seen one where I didn't know.
01:19:22.42 --> 01:19:27.62 I didn't know that, you know, that, like, this guy, that person.
01:19:27.62 --> 01:19:28.62 I knew him.
01:19:28.62 --> 01:19:29.62 I know him.
01:19:29.62 --> 01:19:31.82 But I didn't know he got a shirt and stuff.
01:19:31.82 --> 01:19:36.34 I want to be an Indianapolis, or I want to be in Philadelphia.
01:19:36.34 --> 01:19:40.06 I'd be walking down the street and see some guys as a represent in hardcore.
01:19:40.06 --> 01:19:42.06 Right there in the street.
01:19:42.06 --> 01:19:43.06 That'll be awesome.
01:19:43.06 --> 01:19:47.78 Well, I can attest that with the online stuff I've seen, the people representing, they
01:19:47.78 --> 01:19:49.34 are representing hardcore.
01:19:49.34 --> 01:19:50.34 Yeah.
01:19:50.34 --> 01:19:51.34 Anything else?
01:19:51.34 --> 01:19:53.34 No, that's it.
01:19:53.34 --> 01:19:55.58 If you like it, just grab one if you want.
01:19:55.58 --> 01:19:56.58 Right on.
01:19:56.58 --> 01:20:04.86 Well, as always, if you want to continue this conversation with us, all these questions we
01:20:04.86 --> 01:20:08.82 answered tonight, never from you guys, they're from the troopers.
01:20:08.82 --> 01:20:09.82 They're from you also.
01:20:09.82 --> 01:20:11.26 Thank you for doing that.
01:20:11.26 --> 01:20:15.46 We are on the interwebs on Twitter.
