I think even people who are just naturally defensive, you know, you know, because people are different, you know, I think over time they tend to be, when they kind of build this, kind of, when everyone builds a reputation of not blaming, it's like they they, they let that natural guard down in these tent, look over time, you know, even if they at first, they don't want to. And they get, and you kind of said this anyway, but you give them experience, like when you let them make for your decision to get, because really that's really what common sense is, right, if you have or don't have common sense, it's like, if you have a lot of experience, common sense is like, you're a little bit more in touch with it than someone with very little experience. No, it's good for this and most of the things where if I or we start thinking that we're the exception, so we don't have to put in like, I don't know, like the work or whatever, not necessarily work, but the, you know, like, okay, we'll take this. You know what it's funny is we think about like, why you wouldn't like someone, what causes you to not like someone, most of the time that's your ego anyways. You almost think when somebody asks me a question like this, you almost think in their back of their mind they're going, you know what, Jock was going to tell me and I'm going to go even harder. If you brought them to the airport and you know when you're checking in, you know, and you put the your luggage on the scale and you know you were pushing it, you know that it may be over 50 pounds and you're like nervous. Not as it wasn't as overt, but just like, you know, I don't like, I went because I, not only is he like, when you look at him or whatever, they're kind of competitive with you, You know, you got to do that with your kids sometimes, you know, because like, your kid is doing something that you know they shouldn't be doing, but it's kind of funny. But if they're like normal shorts, I'm going to scrub it with like a brush and it's going to kind of mess up the shorts a little bit right there. And a lot of times, just like I said, it has to do with like your ego or your, you know, this, this sense of vengeance, little micro sense of vengeance because I can't believe she doesn't respect the fact that I took out the trash. Like if you're in scenarios often where you were looking around and seeing what other people are doing and wearing, like, and all this stuff, if you're in constantly in situations like that, that will become more part of your common sense. Like any feeling of like, oh, oh, I should, you know, excuse me, you know, whatever. And you still think the normal morale, like people need to just toughen up, you know, like freaking the reality. And I was telling him, I was like, oh, when I talk on the podcast about the paltune commander, that was like the best, that's when I'm talking to he's like, no way. And sometimes like behavior or whatever things like that can lead to behavior that makes people not want to work for you or not feel good about the job. Actually, where, you know, like some, bosses that we like, hey, I'm not here to make you feel good or I'm not here to make friends or whatever. You're just going to be people will just be, well, you know, the one you're not going to like, on. But all you got to do is ask, like, is this going to help the relationship with my wife or my family, whoever it is in your, is this going to help the relationship if I do this or don't do this or isn't going to hurt it? And I'd be, look, and he was saying, like, oh, I look at him and be like, sir, you know, you don't need to do that. Do you talk about building relationships a lot at work, even when people whom you might not like, even with people whom you don't like. It's like decked out to take into the highest level the Roll call is like hey, we're here to get the information out to people that need it People that are in the field every day whether it's in the military So if it's like, you know, the guy who, you know, they, I don't think that my boss cares about me. So it's like to say, I mean, there are plenty of people who in normal everyday life have normal common sense, like everyone else, who would wear shoes on the mat. Which is where when you talk it like you're not saying fluff, you know, when you talk it's like something. Anyway, so I found in social situations, if I feel that, like if I'm like trying to talk or that I'm getting interrupted a lot a lot, man, in a way, they don't really care that much about what you have to say. You know, it'll make it like kind of friddle fray or something like that. It's field manual that's kind of manual in my opinion, but this is like a manual for life I think it's like a very basic backbone for life It is start there you'll be you'll be solid. but maybe they do something just this much different than you, you know, like a just different in philosophy or something like that. Just like, I mean, back to the questions, kind of like, just to kind of get a handle on understanding what extreme ownership is.
