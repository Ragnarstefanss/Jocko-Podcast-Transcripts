00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.72 This is Jockel Podcast number 197 with Andrew Paul and me, Jockel willing. Good evening Andrew. Good evening
00:00:08.36 --> 00:00:11.40 For those of you that don't know Andrew Andrew
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:19.08 What's one of my brothers from task unit? Bruser. He's now with us at echelon front and if you haven't heard podcast
00:00:19.60 --> 00:00:22.84 Number 42 that's when Andrew came on and
00:00:24.16 --> 00:00:26.16 talked about his experiences
00:00:26.16 --> 00:00:32.32 But we're not really interviewing Andrew today. He's just filling in for echel Charles
00:00:33.24 --> 00:00:35.88 Who's on vacation again?
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:42.56 Vacation. Yeah, so that's why Andrew's here. So I have someone to talk to
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:45.04 Otherwise it gets lonely in the podcast room
00:00:46.32 --> 00:00:48.32 All right
00:00:48.32 --> 00:00:52.92 He've heard me say before if you know the way Broadway you see it and all things that's what
00:00:52.92 --> 00:00:55.64 A little quote from Musashi
00:00:57.48 --> 00:01:01.80 But beyond that when you pull the thread on things
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:06.20 When you dig down and you dig in
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:10.28 You find that things are are
00:01:11.20 --> 00:01:17.40 Not just similar. They're actually connected. There's a thread that runs through time and through history
00:01:18.04 --> 00:01:20.44 And there's a thread that runs through
00:01:21.48 --> 00:01:22.84 knowledge
00:01:22.84 --> 00:01:29.36 Knowledge itself and when you start connecting things you understand them better so there's some I see them all the time
00:01:30.76 --> 00:01:32.76 In about face my
00:01:32.76 --> 00:01:34.12 favorite book
00:01:34.12 --> 00:01:37.84 Colonel David Hacworth talks about one of his mentors
00:01:38.76 --> 00:01:41.32 The guy he served with and the guy named Glover Johns
00:01:42.68 --> 00:01:48.96 Who was a officer in the army who wrote a book that we covered on this podcast called the clay pigeons and St. Lo
00:01:48.96 --> 00:01:55.04 How how crazy is that connection? I had John Stryker, my run and
00:01:55.68 --> 00:02:01.08 When when he was on in one of his books he was talking about Elden Boswell a
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:04.04 Sog operator
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:08.88 That actually was a mentor to one of my mentors in the seal teams
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:12.64 To connection how crazy is that?
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:15.44 What about the fact that I
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:18.40 read about and admired
00:02:18.96 --> 00:02:20.96 Dick Winners
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:23.76 Commander the second of the 506 the band of brothers and Europe
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:28.92 And then in Ramani we worked with the first of the 506
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:32.96 So these connections there just everywhere
00:02:33.20 --> 00:02:41.08 There's everywhere you look things are connected now one of my favorite old field manuals is called FM
00:02:41.48 --> 00:02:44.84 100 attack five field service regulations
00:02:44.84 --> 00:02:51.80 It was issued by the Department of War on May 22nd, 1941 and it's an awesome
00:02:53.60 --> 00:03:01.48 Manual all kinds of information and I'm gonna cover it on the podcast, but the thing is the FM 100 attack five
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:03.76 is not
00:03:03.76 --> 00:03:07.28 the most original document that I've ever seen and
00:03:07.28 --> 00:03:14.64 I've talked about the roots of maneuver warfare in fact we covered a book called maneuver warfare
00:03:15.76 --> 00:03:17.76 and the
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:21.12 influence of the Prussian armies defeated the battle agenda
00:03:21.28 --> 00:03:23.60 You got general sharn horse and his
00:03:24.44 --> 00:03:26.44 influence on the Prussian
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.72 Military and thereby the German military well what's interesting is FM 100 attack five again
00:03:32.72 --> 00:03:38.76 This is an American field service regulations an American field manual it was so
00:03:39.32 --> 00:03:45.92 plagiarized it completely plagiarized from another document and this document
00:03:47.36 --> 00:03:49.04 is called
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:54.20 Troopinfrug, which is my attempt at German Troopinfrug
00:03:54.72 --> 00:03:57.04 which basically translates to
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:03.56 leading troops and it was first published in
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:06.56 1933
00:04:06.56 --> 00:04:11.52 So we're talking about Nazi Germany and it was prepared by
00:04:12.64 --> 00:04:19.72 by a group of people a group of military men, but the leader of that group of military men was a guy named Colonel General
00:04:20.32 --> 00:04:22.32 Ludwig Beck
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:25.28 now
00:04:25.28 --> 00:04:29.68 Nazi's obviously are a scourge to humanity
00:04:30.40 --> 00:04:34.24 But what's interesting is this guy General Beck was
00:04:35.24 --> 00:04:39.36 not a fan of the Nazis he wasn't really a fan of Hitler in fact
00:04:40.96 --> 00:04:49.52 He was eventually executed by the Nazis because he's one of the guys that coordinated and tried to
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:56.24 Assassnate Hitler he's one of those guys and they figured it out and they assassinated him so
00:04:57.52 --> 00:04:59.52 He had some good character
00:05:01.52 --> 00:05:06.70 And he had of outstanding military sense he was educated kind of like the traditional
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:11.44 Prussian military education served as a staff officer in World War I
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:15.28 He was he he objected
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:18.80 staunchly to the the
00:05:20.40 --> 00:05:26.96 Offence of Germany starting World War II he did not want to go and fight he realized that it was gonna be a problem
00:05:28.96 --> 00:05:34.80 And again he resigned in protest actually he resigned in protesting he tried to get a bunch of other people to resign
00:05:35.92 --> 00:05:37.92 and
00:05:37.92 --> 00:05:40.88 You know they kind of covered it up and made him walk away
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:46.24 Then like I said eventually he tried to kill Hitler he tried to plot the kill Hitler in it and I think it was rumble
00:05:47.20 --> 00:05:52.40 Rommel was saying because rummel also participated in the attempt of assassination of
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:56.000 Hitler which is why he got killed
00:05:56.16 --> 00:06:00.96 We'll go into that someday on the podcast. I'm sure they came to him and said hey
00:06:02.48 --> 00:06:06.04 You can come with us now and you'll die a hero
00:06:06.04 --> 00:06:12.60 Well, you have to kill yourself, but you know we won't say anything or we're gonna send you to court and make you a
00:06:13.88 --> 00:06:14.92 You know
00:06:14.92 --> 00:06:20.44 A public scapegoat for everything that's going wrong in Germany and he chose the former went out in the woods
00:06:20.92 --> 00:06:23.80 Said goodbye to his family went out in the woods and killed himself. That's
00:06:25.80 --> 00:06:28.92 That's Rommel so back was executed
00:06:28.92 --> 00:06:40.36 Um, but like I said his character obviously was a little bit you know what he had some some good character traits stood up for what he believed in and the fact that this book
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:42.44 Trooping through them
00:06:43.40 --> 00:06:45.40 The fact that this book
00:06:45.64 --> 00:06:46.84 Is
00:06:46.84 --> 00:06:52.84 Has been so widely copied the Americans use something based on of the brits you something based the German still use something based on it
00:06:52.84 --> 00:07:00.28 Really kind of reveals his leadership knowledge so with that we'll go to the book
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:06.20 The book Trooping through them am I getting better at saying that sounds good to me trooping for them
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.12 All right kicks off with the introduction the introduction starts with
00:07:14.04 --> 00:07:18.68 The conduct of war is an art depending upon free creative activity
00:07:18.68 --> 00:07:24.60 Scientifically grounded is that the way you think of it. I love that definition out of the gate
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:28.20 War is art
00:07:29.32 --> 00:07:33.64 Depending on free creative activity scientifically grounded
00:07:34.20 --> 00:07:38.76 It makes the highest demands on the personality boom. It makes that makes complete sense to me
00:07:38.76 --> 00:07:40.04 Yeah, I know it does
00:07:40.04 --> 00:07:45.08 That I think the first time I said that was with Tim Ferriss at some point and I said
00:07:45.08 --> 00:07:49.96 I said war is an exercise in creativity. That's what I said and here you have
00:07:50.76 --> 00:07:57.80 Where I subconsciously or consciously stole that from or just found that to be true. Yes, or just found that because I'm going to people say oh
00:07:57.80 --> 00:08:02.76 Well, you know get to be a robot to be a soldier. It's actually not natural you will you will be destroyed
00:08:04.04 --> 00:08:07.24 Next the conduct of war is based on continuous development. Oh
00:08:07.24 --> 00:08:13.80 Oh check new means of warfare call forth ever changing employment
00:08:14.36 --> 00:08:19.08 Their use must be anticipated their influence must be correctly estimated and quickly utilized
00:08:19.88 --> 00:08:22.92 situations in war are of unlimited variety
00:08:23.24 --> 00:08:28.52 They change often and suddenly and only rarely are from the first discernible
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:36.44 Incalculable elements are often of great influence the independent will of the enemy is
00:08:36.44 --> 00:08:38.44 Pitted against ours
00:08:41.32 --> 00:08:47.64 The independent will of the enemy is pitted against ours friction and mistakes are of every day occurrence
00:08:49.16 --> 00:08:51.16 So this guy is out of the gate
00:08:51.16 --> 00:08:53.48 You know he he knows what he's talking about
00:08:53.48 --> 00:08:58.36 Everyone of these things just nails it but what's always interesting of course is that
00:08:58.36 --> 00:09:05.88 He's talking about war, but guess what it applies to everything you do in life because guess what everything in life
00:09:06.76 --> 00:09:09.32 Is gonna change it's unlimited variety
00:09:10.04 --> 00:09:17.16 It's a test of wills there's friction and mistakes that occur every day no matter what you're doing your business with your family no matter what you're doing
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:20.44 You are you are going to experience this
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:25.08 The teaching of the conduct of war cannot be concentrated
00:09:25.08 --> 00:09:27.08 Exhaustively in regulations
00:09:29.48 --> 00:09:31.48 The principles so
00:09:31.48 --> 00:09:35.72 Inunciated must be employed dependent upon the situation
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:39.08 so
00:09:39.40 --> 00:09:45.24 Exhaustively you cannot you cannot focus exhaustively on regulations which again as you just pointed out and drew the
00:09:46.20 --> 00:09:48.20 That's what people think
00:09:48.20 --> 00:09:52.28 That oh you're in the military you just follow orders no
00:09:52.28 --> 00:09:58.52 You have to be able to think in fact if all you do is follow regulations you're wrong
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:04.44 Simplicity of conduct
00:10:06.44 --> 00:10:10.52 Logically carry through will most surely attain the objective
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.44 Yes
00:10:14.44 --> 00:10:19.32 war is the severeest test of spiritual and bodily strength in
00:10:19.32 --> 00:10:23.32 War character outways intellect
00:10:25.32 --> 00:10:29.40 Many stand forth on the field of battle who in peace would remain unnoticed
00:10:30.44 --> 00:10:32.44 That's an interesting
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:40.20 Yeah, I didn't see that coming this intro. That's just I think what he's saying is
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:47.24 That that person with the strong will that person with the strong character
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:51.48 Amen, you can be a really smart person and be mentally weak
00:10:52.04 --> 00:10:57.24 All day long agreed discipline. Yes, so you can be super smart and when
00:10:57.88 --> 00:10:59.88 Things get crazy you're
00:11:00.36 --> 00:11:03.96 Shriveling up you're thinking too much right you're shrilling up in the corner
00:11:04.20 --> 00:11:08.60 Scared of what might happen where you if you're just a dude that has strong character
00:11:09.16 --> 00:11:11.16 Guess what you can step up and win
00:11:11.16 --> 00:11:18.20 And how about when if you can know all the right things to do but if you lack the fortitude and discipline
00:11:18.92 --> 00:11:26.84 To do it this you're it does like how many doctors know all the right things about health and yet maybe are not in great shape
00:11:27.24 --> 00:11:30.36 So they know the things to do but they don't do this as I'm saying kind of thing
00:11:31.40 --> 00:11:35.000 Maybe don't see this very often anymore, but like doctors that smoke
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.68 Well now I guess you just get doctors that eat crap right horrible, so yes
00:11:41.64 --> 00:11:44.92 Same thing so that that strength of character
00:11:47.08 --> 00:11:51.24 Doesn't matter you can overwhelm the super smart dude over in the corner
00:11:54.76 --> 00:11:56.76 Next
00:11:56.76 --> 00:12:04.28 Armies as well as lesser units demand lead and by the way if you can tell my reading is kind of stillted you know because
00:12:04.92 --> 00:12:11.72 It's translation so there's some weird words some weird orders of words that don't quite flow
00:12:12.68 --> 00:12:16.60 Which is why I was gonna read the the American manual 100-55 first
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.52 But no I decided to do this one first because it's more challenging. Well, it's funny though
00:12:20.52 --> 00:12:27.64 I when as you've been reading this already I haven't thinking wow this is so concisely written and the words are so carefully chosen
00:12:27.64 --> 00:12:33.96 And then I thought wait this is was this no wasn't written in English was written in German yet it's translated so well
00:12:33.96 --> 00:12:35.64 Yeah, the American one
00:12:35.64 --> 00:12:39.16 I'm gonna do that one probably next, but it's it's even more
00:12:39.64 --> 00:12:41.64 Like to the point
00:12:41.64 --> 00:12:42.44 So
00:12:42.44 --> 00:12:44.92 But you gotta know where you gotta know where connections come from
00:12:44.92 --> 00:12:51.72 I agree you gotta all back. Yeah, yeah, so continuing on armies as well as lesser units demand of leaders good
00:12:51.72 --> 00:12:58.52 Judgment here's what leaders need good judgment clear thinking and far seeing leaders with independence and decisive
00:12:58.76 --> 00:13:01.72 Resolution leaders with perseverance and energy
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:06.44 Leaders not emotionally moved by the varying fortunes of war
00:13:07.16 --> 00:13:09.40 Leaders with a high sense of responsibility
00:13:09.40 --> 00:13:14.28 Yeah, it's not everything I talk about
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.56 They'll decentralize command here. Yeah decentralized command. Oh high sense of responsibility
00:13:19.56 --> 00:13:21.56 I think we might call that extreme ownership right
00:13:23.08 --> 00:13:25.08 Unemotionally moved
00:13:25.08 --> 00:13:28.20 Not emotionally moved by the varying fortunes of war detach
00:13:29.96 --> 00:13:33.32 So yeah, this this is just epic it's great
00:13:33.32 --> 00:13:43.64 The officer is a leader and a teacher besides his knowledge of men and his sense of justice must be distinguished by his superior knowledge and experience his earnest
00:13:45.48 --> 00:13:53.88 His earnestness his self control and high courage. I mean, yeah, this is just so awesome so legit
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.96 And it's funny because a lot of times people you know what's what you know they asked this question almost like a rhetorical question like
00:14:01.96 --> 00:14:06.12 But what is a leader you know, but what really is leader there you go yeah, we just just read it
00:14:06.52 --> 00:14:11.48 Yeah, so listen to that check those things in the mirror when you're trying to be a leader you know check and see
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:13.72 If you're emotionally
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:16.52 Detached check and see if you're earnest
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Boom earnest
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:25.48 Check yourself control check your knowledge check your experience all those things
00:14:25.48 --> 00:14:33.56 Continue on the example and personal conduct of officers and non-commission officers are of decisive influence on the troops
00:14:35.08 --> 00:14:40.36 Wow the officer who in the face of the enemy is cold-blooded decisive and courageous
00:14:40.76 --> 00:14:48.68 Inspires his troops onward the officer must likewise find the way to the hearts of his subordinates and gain their trust through the an
00:14:48.68 --> 00:14:55.32 Understanding of their feelings and thoughts and through never ceasing care of their needs
00:14:56.36 --> 00:15:00.92 I mean relationships how much we talk on this right and it's this dichotomy
00:15:01.72 --> 00:15:02.76 I mean
00:15:02.76 --> 00:15:06.60 Detached emotionally, but not on emotion. You have to care and if you know the check here. I mean
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:10.36 so ridiculous so ridiculously
00:15:11.72 --> 00:15:15.80 Incredible that I guess is not that ridiculous incredible. It's like oh
00:15:15.80 --> 00:15:19.08 You put a guy in
00:15:19.32 --> 00:15:24.84 2000 and whatever into a combat scenario when he's got a loot lead troops in a tough situation
00:15:26.12 --> 00:15:30.92 If they're successful at it, they're gonna come to the same conclusions that someone did in World War I
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:37.48 Which is where this guy was coming this is 89.000 years ago that this was written right and well here's the thing people have been fundamentally the same for
00:15:38.20 --> 00:15:41.32 5000 years these are fundamentally true about human nature. Yes
00:15:41.32 --> 00:15:43.32 Yes
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:48.36 But never ceasing to care for their needs
00:15:49.56 --> 00:15:51.08 When I had
00:15:51.08 --> 00:15:53.48 Mook mook on general mookyama
00:15:54.04 --> 00:15:57.72 He's the he's the guy that used that word Ross like
00:15:58.84 --> 00:16:03.88 Yes, he was one of hackwords company commanders and Vietnam and he was just
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:09.000 You know, I was saying this and I was saying that he's like yeah, you got a care for your men
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 I don't like check and
00:16:12.20 --> 00:16:17.16 That's what he was talking about hackworth once again hackworth known as this you know badass hard-ass guy
00:16:18.04 --> 00:16:22.36 And he just hackworth cared about them more than anything. Yeah
00:16:26.52 --> 00:16:30.36 Mutual trust is the sureest basis of discipline
00:16:30.92 --> 00:16:32.92 In necessity and danger
00:16:32.92 --> 00:16:40.28 This is what I've been trying to explain to people for a couple years now is that is that the the word accountability
00:16:42.12 --> 00:16:43.32 I
00:16:43.32 --> 00:16:49.56 Only have to hold someone accountable if they don't have if we don't have that mutual trust where they understand where I'm coming from and they just go oh
00:16:49.72 --> 00:16:54.20 You want the weapons clean cool they'll be clean. I don't have to go and inspect the weapons right
00:16:54.92 --> 00:16:58.44 There's a mutual trust there and in that trust is discipline
00:16:58.44 --> 00:17:07.64 In all situations every leader must exert without a vision of a responsibility his whole personality
00:17:08.36 --> 00:17:14.52 willing and joyful acceptance of responsibility is the distinguishing characteristic of leadership
00:17:18.04 --> 00:17:23.48 This the speaking of plagiarism yeah, I just plagiarize this whole thing. I guess right. Yeah, well
00:17:23.48 --> 00:17:31.48 This does not mean that the subordinate should seek an arbitrary decision without proper consideration of the whole or that he should not obey
00:17:31.64 --> 00:17:36.68 Orders precisely or that he should let his feeling of the greater knowledge take precedence overall
00:17:36.76 --> 00:17:38.76 obedience
00:17:39.32 --> 00:17:41.48 Independence of action should never be based upon
00:17:41.64 --> 00:17:43.64 Contraryness
00:17:44.04 --> 00:17:47.88 Independence of action properly used is often the basis of great success
00:17:47.88 --> 00:17:56.04 So that's why you have to understand what the command is intent is because you got to be support when you make these decisions that you're making as a subordinate
00:17:56.28 --> 00:18:00.36 You got to make sure that they're in line that they're not contrary to what's going on
00:18:00.76 --> 00:18:05.08 But you know it just touched on something real briefly we were about this contrarian mindset
00:18:05.08 --> 00:18:12.76 There are there are people who just walk around with a contrarian mindset and it doesn't matter what gets said like they are always gonna be like well
00:18:13.08 --> 00:18:15.08 Yeah, but you know and
00:18:15.08 --> 00:18:20.52 Sometimes that other that outside thought is is a good angle to think about but you but he just said it
00:18:20.52 --> 00:18:24.56 He goes real quick. He just goes but you can't just be independent for the sake of being a
00:18:24.56 --> 00:18:26.56 Terrier or what a power. He just said that that
00:18:27.08 --> 00:18:33.08 Contrary in mindset which as you know, I mean I even open mind and I definitely try and think about things from a different angle
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:38.36 But you're right people that are just being contrary because they just enjoy the friction right of
00:18:39.24 --> 00:18:43.16 Of arguing with people. Yeah, I'm not I'm not a big supporter of that
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:47.32 And they end up having no influence because
00:18:48.84 --> 00:18:55.32 Because everybody just oh you you're if you they're crying wolf basically right everything they just disagree with every time
00:18:55.32 --> 00:18:57.32 So guess what yeah
00:18:59.40 --> 00:19:01.40 In spite of technique the worth of men
00:19:02.84 --> 00:19:04.84 Is the decisive factor
00:19:04.84 --> 00:19:13.48 It's significant is increased in group combat so the way they translate it in the American one. I think they say they value the
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:17.68 I think they might even call it the combat value meaning basically are the dudes hard
00:19:18.24 --> 00:19:24.80 Like are the dudes hard that's what they're talking about here the worth the worth of men is the decisive factor
00:19:25.16 --> 00:19:29.20 This is an interesting translation here the emptiness of the battlefield demands
00:19:29.20 --> 00:19:35.68 Independently thinking and acting fighters who considering each situation are dominated by
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:39.000 Conviction boldly and decisively to act and
00:19:39.76 --> 00:19:41.76 Determined to arrive at success
00:19:41.76 --> 00:19:44.32 So the emptiness of the battlefield in the American translation
00:19:44.68 --> 00:19:48.08 They talk about because modern warfare
00:19:48.80 --> 00:19:52.64 Demands that we be separate from each other like as you and I know
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.92 If you and I are in patrol we're not close to each other. You know, we're dispersed and we're gonna spread out
00:19:57.92 --> 00:20:02.56 So that we're not gonna get killed by one machine gun round or one more to round
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:06.000 So because of that distance that's what they're talking about when he talks about the emptiness
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.44 So because of that emptiness on the battlefield you have to have independent think independently thinking and acting fighters
00:20:12.08 --> 00:20:17.36 Right because I'm not gonna be there to tell you what to do you're not gonna be there to tell you guys what to do
00:20:17.44 --> 00:20:22.80 They're gonna have to independently act. That's the way it's got to be that's something that we call decentralized
00:20:22.80 --> 00:20:28.68 Experiment being accustomed to physical accomplishments lack of consideration of self
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:35.84 Will power self confidence and courage qualify a man to master the most difficult situations. There you go
00:20:37.28 --> 00:20:43.04 There you go. Let's work on that physical accomplishments. What does that mean? Do athletic things?
00:20:43.04 --> 00:20:46.76 You have to be in shape lack of consideration of self boom
00:20:47.28 --> 00:20:50.40 You're not important will power. Yes
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:57.36 Discipline self confidence and courage qualified man to master the most difficult situations
00:20:59.20 --> 00:21:04.56 The worth of leaders in men determined the battle worth of the troops
00:21:05.36 --> 00:21:09.36 Which is supplemented by the possession care and maintenance of arms and equipment
00:21:10.08 --> 00:21:14.48 Superior battle worth can equalize numerical inferiority
00:21:14.48 --> 00:21:22.24 So if you're just hard core fighters it doesn't matter right how many people the enemies got because we're gonna get
00:21:22.24 --> 00:21:24.24 self
00:21:24.24 --> 00:21:27.92 The higher the battle worth the more vigorous and versatile
00:21:28.48 --> 00:21:30.48 can war be executed
00:21:31.60 --> 00:21:33.60 Superior leadership
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:34.40 and
00:21:34.40 --> 00:21:38.72 Superior troop battle readiness are reliable portence of victory
00:21:38.72 --> 00:21:46.96 The leaders must live with their troops participate in their dangers their wants their joys their sorrows
00:21:47.36 --> 00:21:52.24 Only in this way can they estimate the battle worth and the requirements of the troops
00:21:53.28 --> 00:21:55.28 Sitting around in the ivy tower
00:21:55.68 --> 00:22:00.48 That's interesting though because we do have a thing in this military about the separation to a certain degree
00:22:00.48 --> 00:22:06.48 Right this is saying and so there's gonna be a bounce there too right. I mean, yeah, but you can't be in the ivory tower and totally
00:22:06.48 --> 00:22:08.48 Disassociate people like who's that guy?
00:22:08.48 --> 00:22:11.68 No, I just get orders for that guy battle field the loophoness
00:22:12.32 --> 00:22:15.44 You know you gotta actually get out of the hum v
00:22:16.16 --> 00:22:20.40 And go see what's going on. That's what you got it. Yeah. Yeah. Nope. Yeah
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:25.60 Man is not responsible for himself alone
00:22:26.40 --> 00:22:28.40 But also for his comrades
00:22:30.40 --> 00:22:36.000 He you can do more who has greater capacity of accomplishment must instruct the inexperienced and weaker
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.60 From such conduct the feeling of real comradeship develops which is just as important between the leaders and the men as between the men themselves
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.96 troops only superficially and not through long training and experience well together
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.16 More easily fail under severe conditions and unexpected crisis
00:23:00.16 --> 00:23:05.52 So if you're only superficially and you haven't gone through long training and you haven't been well together
00:23:06.08 --> 00:23:10.72 When the hard times come you ain't gonna make it and that's really when people ask me about
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.96 You know, how do you build the team and how do you develop the bonds and team you do hard stuff together?
00:23:16.96 --> 00:23:21.04 That's right. You do hard stuff and when we work with companies now companies that made it through
00:23:21.84 --> 00:23:23.84 the downturn of
00:23:24.16 --> 00:23:28.16 2007 2008 because most a lot of companies didn't make it but the companies that there was
00:23:28.16 --> 00:23:32.88 Refer back to those experiences like you know, that's what bonded them together right
00:23:33.84 --> 00:23:39.04 Same thing with the military. You know you go through boot camp. What is that? It's a hard experience. You bond with all these people
00:23:39.04 --> 00:23:41.84 And you know when you meet someone else in the military they went through an atominum
00:23:41.84 --> 00:23:47.44 And they went through boot camp or Officer Canada at school or whatever some sort of hard kind of indoctrination
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:50.64 Then you go to airborne school
00:23:51.20 --> 00:23:54.56 Thing where you're all gonna overcome your fears of jumping out of airplanes or whatever
00:23:54.56 --> 00:24:00.72 Then you go to some kind of special operation school same thing you're just you're just putting people through harder and harder
00:24:00.72 --> 00:24:04.56 Things to get them tighter and tighter and more more bonded together
00:24:05.20 --> 00:24:08.64 So they can overcome these adversities when they come their way
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.60 Therefore
00:24:11.60 --> 00:24:20.08 Before the outbreak of war the development and maintenance of steadiness and discipline in the troops as well as their training is of decisive importance
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:29.68 Every commander is enjoying immediately to intervene with all powers that is disposal against any relaxation of discipline
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:35.68 Against excesses plundering panic and other damaging influence
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.24 Gotta get the game if you that stuff going on
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:50.40 Mm-hmm discipline is fundamental in an army it's strict maintenance a benefit to all
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:55.28 No big deal just discipline
00:24:56.40 --> 00:24:59.92 So so it's interesting it's touched on a few things here which I think you know
00:25:00.80 --> 00:25:04.96 We get that because it's military mixed total sense and and it
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:09.60 Talk about it when you want but there's you know people I think struggle with how do you do that in business today?
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:15.04 Well, you know HR and how do I can possibly you have to still find a way to do that appropriately because
00:25:16.24 --> 00:25:19.44 HR doesn't have anything to do with having discipline process procedure
00:25:19.60 --> 00:25:24.56 You know no, no, I'm talking about getting in and knowing what's going on with your people and in their life and
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:29.68 And doing hard things together, you know because I think what people call you got to show up on time do this part of your job
00:25:29.68 --> 00:25:32.88 And so how do you how do you actually deepen those bonds in a company?
00:25:33.28 --> 00:25:37.84 You got to find ways to put people through difficult things together through training
00:25:37.84 --> 00:25:44.32 Find events to do that builds that camaraderie that gets them through a hard time that strengthens the bonds of those relationships
00:25:44.32 --> 00:25:49.76 I see good companies good leaders do it in companies where they just set really tough goals that are
00:25:50.56 --> 00:25:55.44 Very hard but achievable whether it's a production goal whether it's a sales goal whether it's
00:25:56.40 --> 00:26:03.52 Project goal and people have to really turn and burn to get it done. Yeah, and when they get it done
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:10.32 They have to force to work hard together. They're first to go to the extreme a little bit to work extra hours to
00:26:10.88 --> 00:26:16.16 Figure things out to strengthen their relationships and when they get done to everyone you know, and it's stressful
00:26:16.96 --> 00:26:19.84 And then they get done and everyone's kind of holding their head up a little bit higher
00:26:19.84 --> 00:26:24.24 It's right a little bit tighter. So it's not even it doesn't even necessarily have to be that you have to
00:26:24.56 --> 00:26:30.32 Allocate separate training to do this. You go hey guys here's this project. It's doing 30 days
00:26:30.32 --> 00:26:35.84 We're gonna deliver it in 24 days. I ran the numbers. I looked at the schedule
00:26:36.40 --> 00:26:42.80 We can do it who's in and everyone goes yeah, we're in and then everyone buckles down and they overcame
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:46.64 They achieve something that's what they do so that's what that's how you
00:26:47.36 --> 00:26:54.80 That's how you bring that build that bond between people and strengthen teams by doing hard stuff set goals on normal things
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:57.44 Because think about it when I come in and go
00:26:57.44 --> 00:27:00.48 Hey guys, we got this project do it's doing 30 days
00:27:01.12 --> 00:27:02.88 Could take a little bit longer though. I don't know
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:09.60 Everyone know who gets fired up to hear that right? No one no one who goes. Oh cool. I'm gonna take an extra
00:27:09.92 --> 00:27:14.80 Half hour for lunch every day if that's that's no people don't even want to do that
00:27:14.96 --> 00:27:19.28 Like people might think they want to do that people might think they want to do that, but they don't want to do that
00:27:19.28 --> 00:27:20.96 No, they don't want to do that
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:27.68 They don't want to do that they want to get after it and that's our job as leaders is to set that bar and to set it even a little bit higher
00:27:27.68 --> 00:27:33.12 And then and then inspire and encourage and bring everybody along to try and get to that next level further than what they've
00:27:33.12 --> 00:27:38.16 Wait wait oh 24 days. Yeah, all right. Okay, boss. What am I going to do? Yeah, what am I going to do? Just here
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:40.72 Wait a second. You really think this is possible. Yes, I do. Yeah, I do
00:27:40.96 --> 00:27:42.96 I do know what we're gonna make the whole world
00:27:42.96 --> 00:27:47.28 We're gonna make everyone at this company look at us and say dang they did that in 24 days
00:27:47.28 --> 00:27:52.80 I guess what some other teams is gonna do. I know we can do it 23. That's right. I think we think yeah, I know
00:27:53.36 --> 00:27:59.28 I know we get some good competition going so that's awesome. That's what you have to do that's how you build teams
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:06.56 Stress build teams now if you have a team that's slightly fractured guess what that stress will do break it apart
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:11.60 Yeah, it's gonna find those weak. Yes, right so there's a balance. Oh, there's also a balance between
00:28:11.60 --> 00:28:16.56 Hey, you can set goals. Hey, there's a project that's doing 30 days. We're gonna do it in 15
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:21.76 It's unrealistic everyone just looks at it goes yeah, Jochka's an idiot. You understand understood he's in the ivory tower
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:26.24 doesn't even know what it takes to get this done so balance balance there 100%
00:28:28.56 --> 00:28:35.28 Continuing along back to the book the strength of the troops must be able to meet the highest demands in decisive moments
00:28:35.28 --> 00:28:41.92 He who unnecessarily fatigues the troops jeopardizes success. Oh, oh, there you go
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:47.92 The strength employed in battle must stand in proportion to the objective desired
00:28:48.56 --> 00:28:56.000 Unreliable demands prejudice the trust in the leaders and shake the spirit of the troops again. This is a cry wolf situation
00:28:56.16 --> 00:28:58.16 We got to get this done in 15 days
00:28:58.64 --> 00:29:03.76 It's like and that's my you know the first time everyone goes okay, and then maybe we get it done in 15 days
00:29:03.76 --> 00:29:06.96 And then people look up what what we're doing for the next 15 days. We're gonna
00:29:06.96 --> 00:29:12.40 I'm gonna do more you know and you eventually just burn everyone out right so there's a balance that
00:29:14.40 --> 00:29:16.40 Back to the book from the youngest soldier
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:24.08 On up the employment of every spiritual and bodily power is demanded to the utmost
00:29:24.16 --> 00:29:28.72 Only in such conduct is the full power of accomplishments of the troops
00:29:28.72 --> 00:29:37.28 Achieved so do men develop and maintain their courage and powers of decision in hours of stress and carry forward with them
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:41.52 To greater deeds their weaker comrades
00:29:41.52 --> 00:29:48.56 So you can actually pass on your strength to the people around you in moments of stress. Absolutely if you're strong
00:29:50.24 --> 00:29:53.52 Does that you know like when people quit in Buds?
00:29:54.88 --> 00:29:57.60 I got I like took their
00:29:57.60 --> 00:30:03.20 Power it's so hard to say that man. I can't I was literally about some people
00:30:03.20 --> 00:30:06.000 Some people go the other way right some people they see someone quit and they're like oh
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.76 Dude if he's quit, no I'm quitting that's right. I can't even relate. Yeah, I mean I mean I thought I saw it happen
00:30:12.40 --> 00:30:15.04 And not from some dude. I'm not like some big you know
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:20.000 There's not from to some ecotistical perspective. I say I can't really I just I'm not wired like that I
00:30:20.72 --> 00:30:23.36 I'm wired like call a corny, but you know high-landered like
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:28.96 You know how you would absorb like the strength of like that's kind of kind of like but like
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:35.68 You know when a guy would quit I have somehow I felt like I absorbed his what was left of his power and it actually
00:30:35.68 --> 00:30:41.44 It more like it inspired me it's it inspired me to keep going the fact that I could keep going and that guy couldn't
00:30:41.84 --> 00:30:43.84 It just I was like okay, you know, I mean
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:48.08 It gave me more purpose. Yeah, that's why
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:51.04 You just got to stay hard man
00:30:51.04 --> 00:30:53.04 You know
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:58.80 People are starting to because you're you're if other people start to see you like cracking and
00:30:59.44 --> 00:31:02.96 There are your troops. They're gonna be like oh no, right? This is a bad sign
00:31:03.52 --> 00:31:06.48 Yeah, because jocos breaking down. This is not good
00:31:07.84 --> 00:31:11.92 Yeah, because we also are like well that will never happen if we jocos so jocco don't ever get
00:31:12.72 --> 00:31:14.72 Now don't worry
00:31:14.72 --> 00:31:18.40 If you took a knee we wouldn't we wouldn't let you or we would just step in for you. Yeah
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:21.76 But I don't see that happening not happening
00:31:22.80 --> 00:31:28.000 Here this is what you I was actually gonna jump right here because when we started this thing off you you talked about this a little bit
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:30.88 The first demand in war is decisive action
00:31:31.60 --> 00:31:34.72 So like you were saying like hey you can be the smartest person with a great plan
00:31:34.72 --> 00:31:36.88 But if you can't do it if you can't act on it
00:31:37.20 --> 00:31:42.96 Everyone the highest commander and most junior soldier must be aware that omissions and
00:31:42.96 --> 00:31:49.52 And neglects incriminate him more severely than the mistake of choice
00:31:51.04 --> 00:31:55.04 So if you decide not to act you are a worse
00:31:55.52 --> 00:32:00.72 Criminal yeah in the world I agree then someone that just makes a bad decision bad judgment
00:32:00.72 --> 00:32:08.72 But moves I just disappeared for second back to Ramadi and and thought of those exact that exactly happening like in real life like
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:16.08 Like in those moments when there is things going on you act and you can maneuver in
00:32:16.64 --> 00:32:21.68 Aggressively solve a problem even if you make a small mistake. It's it's the default aggressive
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:25.92 Yes, right. It's the complacency while I sit back and our dick kind of went away
00:32:25.92 --> 00:32:29.76 I wish that no, I just steamed all this you got to make a call now
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:32.000 Obviously
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.16 Having to point this stuff all the time, but it's the truth
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:38.96 If you just jump and make rash decisions without thinking about them that's also stupid
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:43.44 You have to let things develop but this idea of in action
00:32:43.44 --> 00:32:47.20 I mean it is the worst that's why what are what are people say about
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:51.76 Inaction is a decision so like no decision is the bad decision right?
00:32:52.32 --> 00:32:57.20 No decision is the worst decision no decision is a decision first of all yeah no decision is a decision
00:32:57.92 --> 00:32:59.12 And
00:32:59.12 --> 00:33:03.20 It might be the worst decision sometimes no decision while I watch things develop
00:33:03.20 --> 00:33:06.56 You might be the right call but let's be clear no decision is a decision
00:33:07.20 --> 00:33:08.80 What I've been trying to teach people lately
00:33:09.92 --> 00:33:12.80 Is like a standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do
00:33:13.28 --> 00:33:16.64 Here's the standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do you
00:33:17.60 --> 00:33:21.52 Look at what the situation where you take you did that you take a step back you look at what's unfolding
00:33:22.16 --> 00:33:24.16 Then you make the smallest
00:33:25.12 --> 00:33:28.88 Decision in the area that you guess is the right direction to move
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:36.24 And then you assess what that did so you don't just jump off and flank left because you thought that was the right call
00:33:36.24 --> 00:33:37.52 No you go okay
00:33:37.52 --> 00:33:42.16 Hey guys start pushing left okay, so they start moving a little bit. Do they meet major resistance?
00:33:42.72 --> 00:33:44.72 No, okay cool continue with a flank
00:33:45.04 --> 00:33:48.88 You don't just go flank left now they run over there now they're getting flanked and it's a bad situation
00:33:49.20 --> 00:33:50.40 So
00:33:50.40 --> 00:33:52.64 That's the thing you you make a small decision
00:33:53.28 --> 00:33:56.88 The smallest possible decision that you can but you make a decision
00:33:56.88 --> 00:34:00.32 You start moving in the direction that you think is correct assess yes
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:03.04 Move yes
00:34:03.04 --> 00:34:04.16 assess
00:34:04.16 --> 00:34:06.96 Yeah, you get an in-loop is what you're gonna do. You're gonna end up in a little in-loop
00:34:07.28 --> 00:34:09.68 But people get afraid of making a big decision
00:34:10.88 --> 00:34:14.96 Now sometimes you have to make a big ball decision of course, but people get afraid of
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:21.84 Making that they can't see they only want to go 100% in right they don't see that they can go 8%
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:24.40 Yeah, so 8% in
00:34:24.40 --> 00:34:29.20 Is that the last muster so I think it was at the last muster someone asked me something about this
00:34:29.20 --> 00:34:32.56 But you know when you say hey we want to go explore this new market area
00:34:33.12 --> 00:34:39.60 Let's let's buy three buildings in that market area and see where it happens. No
00:34:39.60 --> 00:34:42.40 That's not what you do first do market research
00:34:42.40 --> 00:34:46.40 Then maybe you put a couple key asks up on the street corner and see there's any interest
00:34:46.40 --> 00:34:48.40 I'll leave some space
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:50.40 You know like that's what you do
00:34:50.40 --> 00:34:57.60 That's the kind of mentality you can have you don't need to just be paralyzed by the fact that it's this giant you break it down into some smaller decisions
00:34:57.60 --> 00:35:03.04 It would have decision making is what I call it and to be clear this is in the I don't know what to do right now
00:35:03.04 --> 00:35:06.000 I'm in an unknown position right I mean because
00:35:06.72 --> 00:35:12.72 You know we're not talking about sheepishly going in directions here. We're talking about no no what to do here
00:35:13.44 --> 00:35:14.96 So I will
00:35:14.96 --> 00:35:19.20 Go in the direction that I believe to be the best, but I'm gonna take a small decision as I can
00:35:19.20 --> 00:35:22.40 I don't want to take too much ground in the right could it could be the wrong direction
00:35:22.40 --> 00:35:25.04 It would be the wrong direction. I'm gonna go the direction that I think is right
00:35:26.24 --> 00:35:34.16 But in the smallest of a decision that I can make in that direction and then I'm gonna reassess yes and guess what if it's the wrong decision
00:35:34.32 --> 00:35:39.36 Now you know that if it's the wrong direction you just you hit a wall there now you just figured that out
00:35:39.36 --> 00:35:42.96 Where when you made no decision you still you don't you still know which way to go that's right
00:35:42.96 --> 00:35:49.12 360 degrees so when I say hey we're gonna go 90 degrees cool we take a step and we realize there's mass of resistance
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:54.32 They're cool we're gonna go 180 degrees oh okay right on you know it's you know it's a you know
00:35:54.32 --> 00:36:00.56 It's a really good like modern day example of that you're even sitting like using your map like like Google maps or whatever
00:36:00.56 --> 00:36:04.64 And if you're not moving in a direction it sometimes doesn't know which direction you're going in
00:36:04.64 --> 00:36:06.08 Oh, so arrow just kind of
00:36:06.08 --> 00:36:09.12 It's like a step out of a hotel. I'm like
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:12.40 Which one must supposed to go here dang it the thing is doesn't even know which one so
00:36:12.40 --> 00:36:15.76 All right, you know I think it's that direction is where it's supposed to go so I start walking
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:20.32 Yeah, as soon as I take 10 steps the map the arrow or ants itself and it's like yeah, you're going the right way
00:36:20.32 --> 00:36:22.64 Sometimes I don't ask you oh you know you went the wrong way
00:36:22.64 --> 00:36:24.72 It is like oh okay cool I'll turn around and go back together
00:36:24.72 --> 00:36:29.52 Or you could have stood there in the door of the hotel blocking the blocking the traffic and
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:36.32 Staring at that compass rotate and it's not going anywhere that is exactly what happens and so that's why you you make a small decision
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:39.32 You didn't you didn't hail a cab and get it
00:36:39.32 --> 00:36:45.08 Start driving that way sprinting down the road. It's 10 steps. Yeah, that's the way it works
00:36:47.08 --> 00:36:48.04 All right
00:36:48.04 --> 00:36:54.76 Can to in by the way I always have to say this why I'm not covering this whole book this book is online PDF
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000 You can download it. It's free
00:36:57.40 --> 00:36:58.68 I'm not reading the whole thing
00:36:58.68 --> 00:37:01.24 There's a bunch of like granularly
00:37:01.48 --> 00:37:08.92 Tactical things inside that were not going to cover but we're covering the big stuff the stuff that's applicable to every
00:37:08.92 --> 00:37:14.04 Thing that we do next section section two it's a second call leadership
00:37:15.48 --> 00:37:19.72 So here we go great successes presumed boldness and daring
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Proceeded by good judgment
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:30.20 Check we never have at our disposal all the desire forces for decisive action
00:37:31.48 --> 00:37:35.08 The news flash you're not going to have everything you want all the time. It's not happening
00:37:35.08 --> 00:37:43.000 He who will be secure everywhere or who fixes forces in secondary tasks
00:37:43.48 --> 00:37:46.20 Acts contrary to the fundamental task
00:37:48.28 --> 00:37:53.000 So if you're a trying to do too many things at the same time we call that prioritize next
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.96 You if you got a button if you're trying to do all these secondary tasks you're not focusing on the main one you're gonna get crushed
00:37:59.40 --> 00:38:01.40 and if you're so
00:38:01.88 --> 00:38:03.88 dang
00:38:03.88 --> 00:38:05.88 Rooted in your situation
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:08.84 If you're secure everywhere
00:38:09.80 --> 00:38:13.64 If you're secure everywhere you're not gonna make any progress
00:38:14.12 --> 00:38:15.56 Yeah, man, that's
00:38:15.56 --> 00:38:21.000 Hunker down. Yeah, I'm secure. I'm safe hunker down when you're hunkering down the enemies maneuvering
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000 That's what's happening
00:38:23.56 --> 00:38:28.12 The weaker force through speed mobility great march accomplishments
00:38:28.60 --> 00:38:33.000 Utilization of darkness and the terrain to the fullest surprise and deception
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.04 Can be the stronger at the decisive area. So boom that's jujitsu by the way
00:38:39.48 --> 00:38:43.32 And special forces and everything we do to leverage our numerically
00:38:44.04 --> 00:38:46.04 smaller force. Yeah
00:38:46.60 --> 00:38:48.92 Time and space must be correctly estimated
00:38:49.16 --> 00:38:55.88 Favorable situations quickly recognized and decisively exploited every advantage over the enemy
00:38:56.04 --> 00:38:59.16 Increases our own freedom of action. And yeah
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:04.04 That's not just special forces not just special operations. It's every
00:39:04.68 --> 00:39:06.36 Mediterranean. They all do this
00:39:07.56 --> 00:39:09.16 If they're good
00:39:09.16 --> 00:39:16.04 Repidity of action in the displacement of troops can be greatly can be assisted greatly or retarded by the roads and streets
00:39:18.36 --> 00:39:21.72 Nets and by the terrain conditions
00:39:24.36 --> 00:39:27.72 The season the weather the condition of the troops are also of influence
00:39:27.72 --> 00:39:32.28 The duration of strategic and tactical operations
00:39:32.28 --> 00:39:35.48 Cannot always be first seen you don't know how long something's going to last
00:39:35.88 --> 00:39:42.04 Successful engagements often precedes slowly often the success of today's battle is first recognized tomorrow
00:39:42.28 --> 00:39:44.28 It's an interesting one
00:39:44.92 --> 00:39:55.16 Surprise of the enemy is a decisive factor in success actions based on surprises are only of great success when we do not permit the enemy to take adequate countermeasures
00:39:55.16 --> 00:39:57.16 So
00:39:57.16 --> 00:39:59.24 You can you got to follow up. That's where you got to follow up
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:02.20 That's why in
00:40:02.44 --> 00:40:10.84 Striking you got to throw combination you can't just throw one punch you got to stinging them with the jab and then you got to hand them with the straight and then you got to get coming with the hook
00:40:11.72 --> 00:40:13.72 That's what you got to do you know it's interesting the
00:40:15.08 --> 00:40:17.08 Don't want about
00:40:17.08 --> 00:40:20.36 Often this success of today's battle is first recognized tomorrow
00:40:20.36 --> 00:40:26.20 What's interesting about that one I don't know if you remember this because I don't know you might not have been
00:40:26.60 --> 00:40:32.52 I might not have engaged you at this level, but when we first started doing sniper overwatches and Ramadi and
00:40:33.72 --> 00:40:36.60 I was getting some questions from off the chain of command
00:40:37.40 --> 00:40:41.000 They were hey look what you know this is after a couple weeks
00:40:41.56 --> 00:40:47.08 It was hey you know we get that you're killing some people, but there's no metrics like there's the
00:40:47.08 --> 00:40:52.52 You've said you shot three iED in places iEDs have not gone down
00:40:53.32 --> 00:40:55.80 Like the and iED places have not gone down and
00:40:57.24 --> 00:41:02.76 Luckily I had read the the one oh the one is it the one tech 24 the counter insurgency manual
00:41:03.32 --> 00:41:07.16 And I had learned from that manual that the average counter insurgency takes seven years
00:41:07.16 --> 00:41:11.16 So I replied back to the chain of command and said hey just kind of FYI
00:41:11.72 --> 00:41:13.72 We're fighting a counter insurgency
00:41:13.72 --> 00:41:16.60 The average counter insurgency takes
00:41:17.40 --> 00:41:20.84 takes seven years to achieve victory
00:41:21.24 --> 00:41:26.76 We've been doing this for two and a half weeks. Can I get a little more time to see some metrics on it?
00:41:26.76 --> 00:41:30.44 So and that's true and actually Colonel McFarlin
00:41:31.40 --> 00:41:34.04 This was a battle that he had to fight because
00:41:35.32 --> 00:41:40.92 Here you are you know it's a metrics based people that are looking at things from a metrics based level right
00:41:40.92 --> 00:41:46.76 They're saying okay in Ramadi there's 30 enemy attacks a day and all of a sudden
00:41:47.40 --> 00:41:51.96 McFarlin rolls in and starts this counter insurgency and the enemy attacks
00:41:52.44 --> 00:41:57.24 Go up or yeah and they go up a lot and so his chain of commands look at that
00:41:57.24 --> 00:42:01.96 What are you doing right what are you doing the enemy attacks are gonna be worse your things not working and he has to explain to them
00:42:02.28 --> 00:42:06.60 You know why the enemy attacks are going up because we are actually taking ground from them and they're fighting
00:42:06.84 --> 00:42:09.16 Yeah, and we're killing them, but this is what's gonna happen
00:42:09.16 --> 00:42:15.96 So the initial metrics are the reverse of what you want and that's the way it is that's what so these
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:20.12 The success of the success of a battle is not always visible today
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:25.96 You have to look at the long-term effects. Well, we went into the Hornets nest. I mean, it's like hey, you know
00:42:25.96 --> 00:42:29.40 What my kid gets stung by this be like you know once a year
00:42:29.56 --> 00:42:34.20 Well, we're gonna go in and get rid of the bees nest all right. Well, we go in there. We got you guys got stung like 20 times
00:42:34.20 --> 00:42:40.60 Yeah, because we went in and we actually are destroying the Hornets nest so they're stinging us now even more. That's why it went up and when we're done
00:42:40.60 --> 00:42:45.16 Though they're not gonna sting us at all, but for now the numbers went up. That's exactly what happened. What do you want to know like that?
00:42:46.36 --> 00:42:51.64 We used to go after the Hornets nest. It's a sort of a test of uh, you know when you're eight years old
00:42:51.64 --> 00:42:53.88 It was it's always a test of of
00:42:55.32 --> 00:42:59.08 Of courage basically because you're gonna go in there with a stick
00:42:59.08 --> 00:43:04.68 Like that they have to see if you can get it to fall down and you know, it's like playing Pinata
00:43:04.68 --> 00:43:09.96 You don't get it on the first shot. It can take some viewers so you whack it and then you run and those things come after you
00:43:11.40 --> 00:43:19.000 Right, but then so all of a sudden this things go on and me attacks go up. Yeah, you get in stung like when you go in and hit a Hornets nest with a with a stick
00:43:19.24 --> 00:43:21.24 You're getting stung
00:43:21.48 --> 00:43:23.48 Pretty much that's what's gonna happen
00:43:23.48 --> 00:43:31.48 All right, back to the book the enemy will likewise endeavor to make use of surprise our conduct must take this in a
00:43:31.48 --> 00:43:38.76 Consideration the knowledge of hostile leadership and war principles can influence the decision and aid our battle conduct
00:43:39.16 --> 00:43:45.08 But it must never lead to preconceptions. Oh, that's good, isn't it like we know what the enemy's gonna do
00:43:45.08 --> 00:43:50.52 But we know really know what that's right. Hey, they're gonna use the laws of combat, but we got a
00:43:50.52 --> 00:43:55.40 Remember that they might they might step outside the bounds of the laws of combat
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.88 Those conditions which facilitate the conduct of war in our land make it difficult make it more difficult in foreign lands
00:44:04.36 --> 00:44:09.16 Require consideration. Yeah, it's much easier on your own grant. We've learned that over and over again
00:44:11.88 --> 00:44:16.60 In strany us combat troops are soon worn out and quickly used up
00:44:16.60 --> 00:44:24.92 The forces must receive timely reinforcements in leaders men animals battle needs and
00:44:25.48 --> 00:44:27.48 War materials of all kinds
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.44 Boys are gonna get worn out after a while the mission and the situation form the basis of action
00:44:39.40 --> 00:44:45.08 The mission and the situation form the basis of action the mission designates the objective to be a chain to be attained
00:44:45.08 --> 00:44:51.08 The leader must never forget his mission a mission which indicates several tasks easily
00:44:51.24 --> 00:44:54.84 Deverts from the main exit objective so once again prioritize next year
00:44:54.84 --> 00:44:58.52 If you've got a bunch of different things you're not gonna achieve the main objective
00:45:01.64 --> 00:45:03.64 At a situation recently
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:11.16 Where people were wearing some of their teammates out and was talking to this company about how to do this and
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:19.32 I said the mission is number one that's our mission mission is number one, but the mission requires people and so you have to take care of your people
00:45:19.32 --> 00:45:24.84 And you have to balance their you know how how tired they are whether they're being replenished
00:45:25.64 --> 00:45:28.76 But again always in balance, but the mission is number one
00:45:28.92 --> 00:45:32.84 But it takes the people and the team to accomplish the mission. So if you wear your team out
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:38.36 Then you got nobody left even accomplish the mission. That's so that's the dichotomy you talk about that in the dichotomy leadership
00:45:38.36 --> 00:45:40.36 I mean if you if
00:45:40.36 --> 00:45:47.08 If all your focus on is the mission your men will be either used up destroyed. They won't trust you anymore. It'll be a disaster
00:45:47.72 --> 00:45:49.72 so your men
00:45:50.04 --> 00:45:52.68 your people have to come first
00:45:54.12 --> 00:45:59.72 And at the same time the dichotomy is if you do nothing but care about your people then guess what
00:46:00.28 --> 00:46:03.96 You won't have anyone you you want to accomplish the mission which by the way
00:46:03.96 --> 00:46:12.52 Hurts your people because if you're in the business world and you're trying to push your people to drive production or or do their job at a faster pace
00:46:13.32 --> 00:46:14.68 Great
00:46:14.68 --> 00:46:18.92 Then you burn them out and they leave and also in the company folds or the opposite okay guys
00:46:19.08 --> 00:46:24.44 You know take your time. We guess what now we don't get anything done and the company folds so what you have to do is you have to balance
00:46:28.76 --> 00:46:30.76 obscurity of the situation is the rule
00:46:30.76 --> 00:46:32.76 Rule
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.80 Seldom will one have exact information of the enemy clarification of hostile situation is is a self evident demand
00:46:40.12 --> 00:46:46.92 However to wait intense set intense situations for information is seldom a token of strong leadership
00:46:47.40 --> 00:46:51.40 Often of weakness so look you're not gonna know everything. It's not gonna happen
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:56.44 You have to make decisions that's what you got to do otherwise sign a weakness
00:46:56.44 --> 00:47:11.72 They edited me on billions oh yes, they they there was one little section where I was in the show billions and there was one little sections where where they showed
00:47:12.92 --> 00:47:14.28 Dollar bill
00:47:14.28 --> 00:47:19.000 Getting like a massage or something like that and I was looking at him when I just go weak
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.04 But I did make the cut
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:35.24 Next the decision arises from the mission and the situation the decision arises from the mission and the situation
00:47:35.56 --> 00:47:41.88 Should the mission no longer suffice as the fundamental of conduct or if it is changed by events the decisions
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:45.000 The decision must take these considerations into account
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:52.84 He who changes his mission or does not execute the one given must report his actions at once and assume all
00:47:53.08 --> 00:47:57.80 Responsibility for the consequences he must always keep in mind the whole situation so that's saying it's wrong
00:47:57.80 --> 00:48:04.20 That's right. Yeah, they're not saying it's wrong. Somebody's gonna be like hey, Andrew wanted me to go and take this building and the building is
00:48:04.60 --> 00:48:06.84 untenable the the enemy's too strong. I
00:48:07.24 --> 00:48:11.16 Need you know I make the decision. I'm not gonna take that building. We need to drop a bomb. We need to do something else
00:48:11.16 --> 00:48:18.28 I just that's fine, but I need to tell you and I need to keep the whole picture in mind because if that building was
00:48:18.68 --> 00:48:21.000 Strati-jiggly important for what we're trying to accomplish
00:48:21.48 --> 00:48:25.96 Well then maybe I have to take more sacrifices than I thought to take the building down
00:48:27.48 --> 00:48:31.72 The the decision must depict a clear objective aimed at with the whole force
00:48:31.72 --> 00:48:38.92 The strong will of the commander must support it often the stronger will gains success
00:48:41.80 --> 00:48:46.20 Without very good reasons the decision once made should not be abandoned. Okay, so this is
00:48:47.24 --> 00:48:54.92 Again critical without without a without very good reasons a decision once made should not be abandoned
00:48:54.92 --> 00:49:01.000 And then it says however in the vicissitudes of war and
00:49:01.88 --> 00:49:05.72 In flexible maintenance of the original decision may lead to great mistakes
00:49:06.28 --> 00:49:13.24 Timely recognition of the conditions and the time which call for a new decision is an attribution of the art of
00:49:13.64 --> 00:49:19.56 Leadership. Yeah, don't stick to the one plan that you came up with
00:49:19.56 --> 00:49:29.08 Doesn't work does not work in change plants you really have my I work for some hard-headed people and the plan would be completely falling apart
00:49:29.08 --> 00:49:31.08 And they're riding that thing in the ground
00:49:31.96 --> 00:49:36.52 They're just taking that they all know they think a real ownership of that real ownership of that
00:49:36.52 --> 00:49:38.52 They're not gonna let it go. They're gonna be right
00:49:39.72 --> 00:49:46.04 The commander must permit freedom of action to his subordinates in so far that this does not endanger the whole scheme
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:52.76 He must not surrender to them those decisions for which he alone is responsible. So freedom of movement. What does that mean?
00:49:52.76 --> 00:49:54.76 That means decentralized command
00:49:55.32 --> 00:49:58.52 The attack is launched in order to defeat the enemy
00:49:59.08 --> 00:50:00.92 The attacker has the initiative
00:50:01.16 --> 00:50:07.32 Superiority of leadership and of troops show the best advantage in the attack success does not always come
00:50:07.80 --> 00:50:13.80 To superiority of numbers so go on the offense. I say that all the time go on the offense now
00:50:13.80 --> 00:50:20.28 Is this 100% of time no but you you have you're you're just that much better off when you're on offense
00:50:20.28 --> 00:50:23.32 You have surprise you have initiative you have the people on their heels
00:50:24.28 --> 00:50:26.92 It's amazing that we were able to take down the
00:50:28.04 --> 00:50:30.92 The island like the island campaign in World War II
00:50:31.48 --> 00:50:38.92 Going into those heavily fortified where the Japanese imperial military had been digging in
00:50:38.92 --> 00:50:47.40 for three four five years yeah preparing those islands for to defend against assaults
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000 United States Marine Corps coming get some
00:50:51.80 --> 00:50:57.64 Seriously now you guys say Marine Corps and of course the Nihai the Army but dang
00:50:58.52 --> 00:51:00.52 Just unbelievable
00:51:00.68 --> 00:51:06.20 That they were able to that's that's going on offense. That's right. So momentum. Yeah. We're going on offense. Oh
00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:12.04 You've been digging in oh you built a miles long tunnel system to defend the silent cool watch this
00:51:12.36 --> 00:51:14.60 We're coming in we got naval gunfire
00:51:15.16 --> 00:51:17.96 We got course ares we got flame thrower's
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.80 And we're coming and obviously at great sacrifice
00:51:23.72 --> 00:51:25.40 But being on the offense
00:51:25.56 --> 00:51:30.92 Being on the offense is a weapon in its own right. I'm great notice this in strategic too like when you're on offense
00:51:30.92 --> 00:51:38.04 You're you're you have the edge you know you're you're one step ahead when you when you're on defense
00:51:38.04 --> 00:51:43.72 You're one step behind and it's not fun and if you're defending for too long
00:51:44.36 --> 00:51:49.96 Eventually you will get caught you will if you're on defense defense defense defense defense defense defense defense defense
00:51:49.96 --> 00:51:51.96 Eventually you will get caught eventually
00:51:52.76 --> 00:51:57.24 You have to at some point switch yeah and get on offense. I don't know who said it
00:51:57.24 --> 00:52:02.52 It maybe it's even cliche at this in these days, but you know the best defense is a good offense
00:52:03.32 --> 00:52:08.36 So you're on defense so you need to convert that to an offense so somebody attacks you you're on defense
00:52:08.36 --> 00:52:13.80 The best defense is a good offense. So it's my deep yeah, yeah, so my I'm a somebody attacks me first
00:52:13.80 --> 00:52:17.000 I'm on defense my best defense to that is to
00:52:18.28 --> 00:52:20.28 Return with an offense
00:52:20.28 --> 00:52:27.80 Yeah, you know what's interesting is a time when this is different is this is nothing
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:29.80 I was talking about if the master is
00:52:30.76 --> 00:52:33.80 If there's if we're arguing about something
00:52:33.80 --> 00:52:34.84 Mm-hmm
00:52:34.84 --> 00:52:40.84 If my if I go with that theory the best defense is a good offense and you start to try and tell me something
00:52:40.84 --> 00:52:44.12 That's not jumping and cut you off and I'm like no we do like this. That's actually wrong
00:52:44.28 --> 00:52:47.48 I agree with you and that's interesting right interesting because
00:52:47.48 --> 00:52:50.04 And I see that all the time because leaders
00:52:50.84 --> 00:52:54.68 People end up in leadership position their personality kind of drives them to be
00:52:55.64 --> 00:52:57.64 Sort of
00:52:57.64 --> 00:53:01.48 Spoken and speak up and all those things when the reality is the the
00:53:02.28 --> 00:53:07.72 More senior you get in leadership position the more you should actually use this this the years, you know
00:53:07.72 --> 00:53:09.72 That what I said at the master was
00:53:09.72 --> 00:53:11.72 98%
00:53:11.72 --> 00:53:17.16 Use your ears 2% use your mouth. Mm-hmm. That's where you end up so this idea that
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:23.32 That you know being on offense is the best way well when it comes to
00:53:24.04 --> 00:53:25.64 Discussions
00:53:25.64 --> 00:53:29.32 You should gather some intel before you act and listen to one other people have to say
00:53:31.72 --> 00:53:33.40 Check
00:53:33.40 --> 00:53:36.68 The possibility that an attack may miscarriage should never permit
00:53:36.68 --> 00:53:45.000 The federing of energetic leadership from the first. Yes, we may lose doesn't matter. We're gonna get some
00:53:45.56 --> 00:53:53.000 Pursuit reaps the fruits of victory. It strives to destroy the enemy which destruction was not possible in the preceding engagement
00:53:54.12 --> 00:53:57.16 Only a through-going relentless pursuit
00:53:57.72 --> 00:54:03.000 Which prevents the enemy from gaining time to rest and recuperate saves ourselves
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.92 Sacrifices necessitated if we permit the enemy force another decisive engagement. No when you get them on the ropes go
00:54:12.28 --> 00:54:17.72 Put them all the way to the river and then toss their bodies in the river. It's one of the ones we run on here
00:54:19.56 --> 00:54:27.000 The defense waits for the opponent the defender seeks to prescribe the battle terrain that's important
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.04 Right if you're on defense you want to bring people into gear arena right the
00:54:33.24 --> 00:54:39.72 Defense is chosen when our own inferiority permits no other choice or if for other reasons
00:54:40.12 --> 00:54:44.92 It appears advantageous. I was just reading a note from a friend of mine
00:54:45.88 --> 00:54:50.92 A team guy who's who's grandfather was in World War II still life gonna get him on the podcast and
00:54:52.04 --> 00:54:54.84 When he did the island campaign
00:54:54.84 --> 00:55:05.08 And then went into like Japan surrender after the bombs and the Japanese were told on your gun in placements put a white flag
00:55:06.28 --> 00:55:11.24 Like so Americans were sailing in like the wars over sailing in I think it was into like
00:55:11.88 --> 00:55:14.60 I don't use it is into some big port Japan and
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:19.56 When he was sailing in there was just white flags everywhere
00:55:19.56 --> 00:55:24.60 Everywhere and he was looking around he said it he said it literally looked like snow
00:55:25.24 --> 00:55:31.56 Wow there were so many weapons and placements and he just said I knew at that point that those atomic bombs
00:55:31.72 --> 00:55:38.20 Saved hundreds of thousands of Americans that would have had to go in there and fight until the end
00:55:39.88 --> 00:55:45.000 So the advantage of the defender as a defender you want to pull people into your
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.36 Into your zone to where you know what the Russians do right I analyzed terrain
00:55:50.44 --> 00:55:54.84 Yeah, channelized terrain perfect, but the Russians were the Russians do. Oh, yeah, you want to fight us cool
00:55:54.84 --> 00:56:00.68 Come on come a little bit further come a little bit further come a little bit further. What is it? It's September come a little bit further
00:56:00.68 --> 00:56:05.64 Right always it's October come just a little bit further. It's November welcome to Russia
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:10.84 Negative 48 degrees. Hope you brought your words. Hope you brought your warmies
00:56:10.84 --> 00:56:12.84 Uh
00:56:13.72 --> 00:56:17.96 The defense is chosen when our own inferiority permits no other choice
00:56:18.84 --> 00:56:21.64 Or if for other reasons it appears advantage
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:25.000 So if you can be an offense, but if you have to you go in defense
00:56:25.32 --> 00:56:30.28 Breaking off an engagement has the purpose of terminating the battle or giving up the former position in order
00:56:30.36 --> 00:56:33.32 Continue the engagement at a more favorable position
00:56:34.60 --> 00:56:35.80 In the ladder
00:56:35.80 --> 00:56:41.000 Instance delaying action is often employed. So yes, sometimes you have to retreat
00:56:43.40 --> 00:56:53.000 The retreat intends to avoid further combat the engagement must for this purpose be terminated and the withdrawal of the troops be protected
00:56:54.36 --> 00:57:00.52 The changing fortunes of battle demand often the passing from one type of engagement to another
00:57:00.60 --> 00:57:02.60 So sometimes you've got to
00:57:02.60 --> 00:57:09.08 Attach and sometimes you've got to defend that's what's gonna happen. That's the reality and Hitler was not
00:57:09.40 --> 00:57:15.40 Hitler got to this point as the war went on where he actually didn't understand that which is why it's the oligrod
00:57:15.48 --> 00:57:21.32 They left those guys and they did plenty of opportunities to retreat no no hold the line
00:57:22.68 --> 00:57:27.48 I did that I covered the book called Stalin grad from that from the Nazi perspective and
00:57:27.48 --> 00:57:29.48 And
00:57:29.48 --> 00:57:31.48 Those guys were
00:57:32.12 --> 00:57:33.64 Surrounded
00:57:33.64 --> 00:57:37.32 They were listening to the radio and Hitler was making speeches
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:44.20 Talking about the brave sacrifices of them in Stalingrad they weren't even dead yet
00:57:44.84 --> 00:57:50.92 Like he was he was saying hey look they're surrounded but they fought to the end. They're still there. They were still there. Wow
00:57:50.92 --> 00:57:56.12 Talk about coward talk about being in your ivory tower
00:57:57.32 --> 00:58:00.36 He left those guys to die surrounded
00:58:03.96 --> 00:58:06.20 Delaying action avoids the decision
00:58:07.40 --> 00:58:16.28 It will gain time keep the enemy busy and deceived so delaying action. Let's let's let's let's let things develop a little bit more
00:58:16.28 --> 00:58:20.44 During the course of the battle the commander influences the action
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.08 most strongly by the concentration and increase of fire and through the employment of his reserve
00:58:28.36 --> 00:58:31.48 Distribution location and employment of the reserve
00:58:31.80 --> 00:58:34.84 Require careful consideration mobility increases the possibility
00:58:35.56 --> 00:58:38.20 For their employment always have a little bit in the tank
00:58:39.16 --> 00:58:41.64 You know always got to have a little bit in tank
00:58:41.64 --> 00:58:48.76 Everybody says that you know it's interesting about delaying. We're talking about like like the Russian so we're a little bit further and
00:58:48.92 --> 00:58:53.80 And going on in this next couple of sentences you feel whether it's an enemy whether it's a competitor
00:58:53.96 --> 00:58:56.28 You know when they're going on the attack they're also
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:01.40 Expending considerable resources absolutely right so so if you can kind of think about it
00:59:01.40 --> 00:59:06.28 Judges who match a guy's on the attack and you're you're in the guard and you're kind of in a defensive position
00:59:06.28 --> 00:59:08.44 Right, you're kind of letting them use his energy
00:59:08.44 --> 00:59:13.24 Right, so let them keep using that energy use that energy in the troops are expanding it takes effort
00:59:13.24 --> 00:59:17.64 Logistical support to keep pushing pushing pushing and you're spreading further and further away from
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:21.08 You know home base where you got all your support and then
00:59:21.48 --> 00:59:26.52 When they're spread and they've expanded their resources and they're down to just maybe the last of their fuel in their food
00:59:26.52 --> 00:59:29.000 No, it boom then you launch your counter attack
00:59:29.80 --> 00:59:32.28 Yeah, so and speaking of
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.64 We know what I brought up before about when you're I don't want to use the term arguing
00:59:37.64 --> 00:59:42.28 But when you're discussing something from a leadership perspective you're in a group you're in a meeting
00:59:43.16 --> 00:59:49.56 exact same situation let the other people talk and express their viewpoints because every time they express their viewpoint
00:59:49.88 --> 00:59:51.88 you have an opportunity to
00:59:52.20 --> 00:59:54.20 to listen to it to
00:59:54.44 --> 00:59:59.64 to understand it to hear someone else make a counter to it and hear their counter to the counter
00:59:59.64 --> 01:00:01.64 So you're getting all this information
01:00:01.64 --> 01:00:06.04 You're receiving all this information you haven't you haven't given up any you haven't used any bullets
01:00:06.04 --> 01:00:10.92 You haven't used any magazines you haven't you you've got everything and you're just observing I mean it's
01:00:12.60 --> 01:00:18.60 I think it was it's either a dick winners or but they wrote hey when when I let someone talk
01:00:18.84 --> 01:00:22.44 I know everything that they know and I I know everything that I know it's like well there you go
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.24 Keep talking because I'm gonna know everything that you know and I'm gonna know everything that I know and you know how you know how when you
01:00:30.52 --> 01:00:33.32 When you do something anything for the second time it's like
01:00:33.32 --> 01:00:39.08 Expo it's not twice as easy it's not twice as easy or it's it's
01:00:39.40 --> 01:00:43.96 exponentially more easy to make a decision so when you go into a room for the first time and there's a guy in the corner
01:00:43.96 --> 01:00:48.04 You don't know what to do with your weapon like it's hard and then you go into that room again
01:00:48.04 --> 01:00:52.84 Or there's there's whatever there's like a couch in an obstacle whatever and you gotta do you gotta you gotta make a decision
01:00:52.84 --> 01:00:54.04 The first time you go in there
01:00:54.60 --> 01:00:57.08 You see a new guy going in there the first the very first time he's ever done
01:00:57.64 --> 01:00:59.64 E jammed up and everything's the disaster
01:00:59.64 --> 01:01:05.88 He does it one time, you know, he looks at it and go okay, you step out due to again. He's exponentially better at doing it
01:01:06.28 --> 01:01:09.000 so when we're having a discussion and
01:01:10.12 --> 01:01:17.000 I get to listen and listen and listen and listen and listen and hear other people give points and counter points around a table
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.56 And you sit there and just listen and go okay, and you can assemble it all you can assemble the the strongest facts
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:28.52 You can identify the biggest weaknesses and then when you finally like you said you've now
01:01:28.52 --> 01:01:32.84 You've now everyone has expanded all their ammunition, but you you have a full magazine
01:01:32.84 --> 01:01:37.64 You're magazine to if I've actually been filled up with more rounds because everyone else is expressing
01:01:38.20 --> 01:01:42.44 Their their points and counter points. So you just sit there and listen and then but by the end here we go
01:01:42.44 --> 01:01:45.80 Here's the plan and everyone goes dang jockels smart
01:01:46.52 --> 01:01:49.16 How did you do that? I just shot my mouth and listen
01:01:51.56 --> 01:01:55.56 All right going back to the book this next section communications
01:01:55.56 --> 01:01:57.56 Information reports
01:01:58.68 --> 01:02:00.68 Situation maps so
01:02:00.68 --> 01:02:04.76 If you think about it what leadership is is actually just
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:09.08 Communicating with other human beings. That's actually what it is great
01:02:09.24 --> 01:02:12.28 You you have to be able to communicate what it is that you need to get done
01:02:12.84 --> 01:02:16.52 to other people. That's what it is. So how does that work?
01:02:17.24 --> 01:02:23.80 The reports and information of the enemy form one of the most important foundations of the estimate of the situation
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:28.44 The decision and its execution you got to know what's going on and it here
01:02:28.44 --> 01:02:34.28 It talks about air and ground reconnaissance it talks about continual observation it talks about information secured through
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.32 Special means and I'm sure they're talking about
01:02:38.04 --> 01:02:40.04 Human resources you know a
01:02:40.84 --> 01:02:43.16 Human human intelligence so spies or whatever
01:02:43.96 --> 01:02:45.96 That's not human resources
01:02:45.96 --> 01:02:47.96 It's a different kind of story
01:02:47.96 --> 01:02:49.96 Human resources
01:02:49.96 --> 01:02:51.96 And then it says from the whole
01:02:51.96 --> 01:02:53.96 Whole
01:02:53.32 --> 01:02:57.72 From the whole of all these different things the commanders able to draw correct conclusions
01:02:58.60 --> 01:03:02.28 Apparently unimportant details in connection with other reports have
01:03:02.68 --> 01:03:07.64 Considerable worth and this is something that I always told us in the military when you come back from an operation at your debrief you say like well
01:03:09.40 --> 01:03:12.52 I remember this specific thing where did you guys find
01:03:13.08 --> 01:03:15.32 Because we my first deployment we would be looking for
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:17.40 Weapons bill you know
01:03:17.40 --> 01:03:21.32 Munitions or something anything that they could be using to build ideas right and
01:03:21.32 --> 01:03:23.64 The question was always where did you find it?
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:27.64 Where did you find it and I first I was like well we found in the bedroom, but where?
01:03:28.36 --> 01:03:33.88 Because is it is it inconceivable to think that if you and I were bad guys and I said hey man
01:03:34.44 --> 01:03:36.44 I'm keeping my stuff
01:03:36.44 --> 01:03:40.52 Taped up under my table when the but when the good guys coming they never find it there. Oh, okay cool
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.56 So I'll do the same thing and we I'm going this from an actual example we found
01:03:46.52 --> 01:03:48.52 Dead cord taped up underneath
01:03:48.52 --> 01:03:54.92 A Mujia Dean fighters table in his house and so this is like I was like oh that that's when it clicked to me
01:03:55.56 --> 01:03:56.28 Oh
01:03:56.28 --> 01:03:57.08 Well
01:03:57.08 --> 01:04:01.88 We should tell everyone that because they probably tell everyone right because that's a pretty good place to hide
01:04:01.88 --> 01:04:03.24 You know tables well this
01:04:03.64 --> 01:04:07.08 Tables have like legs, but then they've got things that the legs attached to
01:04:07.08 --> 01:04:10.20 So if you just look glance under it and it's up under there
01:04:10.20 --> 01:04:13.56 It's kind of hard to see right so maybe someone says hey this where I've been hiding it
01:04:13.56 --> 01:04:16.44 They've searched my house three times haven't found it. We'll find it now
01:04:16.44 --> 01:04:19.40 So we flip things over. That's why we break it now
01:04:21.48 --> 01:04:23.16 So
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:29.96 It continues on every report and the best information are of little or no value when they reach to late
01:04:30.60 --> 01:04:34.36 Into the command for which they're intended. So yeah if you don't pass information timely
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:40.76 Doesn't make any difference all commanders are enjoying as early and to the greatest extent possible to inform
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.08 The higher commander of the situation into transmit all important information
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:47.08 Yes
01:04:47.64 --> 01:04:55.64 The one making a report must express himself clearly and positively. He must differentiate between what he has seen
01:04:56.52 --> 01:05:01.08 What another has noted or stated and what is presumed
01:05:01.88 --> 01:05:08.28 The source of the information must be stated suspicions must have bases
01:05:08.28 --> 01:05:14.44 Those are big yeah, I've
01:05:15.72 --> 01:05:21.16 You've got you've got to pay attention to those things. There's a big difference and that's why we use appears to be right right
01:05:21.16 --> 01:05:24.20 That's one of the biggest ones that they teach us is you don't say
01:05:24.92 --> 01:05:32.36 Hey has an AK47 or hey he's got a weapon if you can't confirm 100% that that guy legitimately has a weapon because it's a big difference between
01:05:32.36 --> 01:05:38.68 Oh, looks like there's something under his dish dasha, right. Oh, it looks like he's looks like he's got a chess rig underneath his dish dasha
01:05:38.92 --> 01:05:44.04 That's a lot different than he's wearing a chest rig right and he's got an AK47
01:05:44.04 --> 01:05:51.40 So it's always appears to be unless you can confirm it and there's a win. I did the mili masqueron here that
01:05:53.08 --> 01:05:55.08 Break down of intelligence
01:05:56.44 --> 01:05:58.44 of it going from
01:05:58.44 --> 01:06:02.60 Like the division level which was hey this is a
01:06:03.72 --> 01:06:05.72 I think they use the word
01:06:05.72 --> 01:06:12.84 The original word was like a suspected VC oh no it was like possible possible VC
01:06:13.88 --> 01:06:15.88 Coordination point
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:22.04 Went from there down to like the brigade level then it turned into like from from possible to suspected
01:06:22.04 --> 01:06:27.80 Just a little bit of a different word yep, yep, then from brigade to battalion it was like
01:06:28.36 --> 01:06:33.72 Likely and it went all the way down when those guys when those when that Charlie company got those words
01:06:33.80 --> 01:06:40.92 It was this is a VC stronghold not only was it that this is a VC stronghold this civilians are no longer there
01:06:41.40 --> 01:06:47.72 The civilians there's no civilians there and what they had heard was on Wednesdays they go to some market this the
01:06:47.72 --> 01:06:51.16 The the the women and children go to this market
01:06:52.60 --> 01:06:53.88 And maybe they did
01:06:54.20 --> 01:07:00.28 But it wasn't like I mean does every single person in your neighborhood go and shop on the same day at the same time?
01:07:00.28 --> 01:07:08.44 No, is there hey Wednesday they got a Wednesday they got specials at the grocery store cool a bunch of people going out there not everyone right but the report that they got was
01:07:09.08 --> 01:07:12.28 There's no friendlies in this village all VC
01:07:12.28 --> 01:07:18.60 Wow and so as that escalated you know you tell that to a 18 year old trooper
01:07:19.16 --> 01:07:24.84 This is an enemy village and guess what they did they went in there and they killed they murdered everyone so
01:07:26.28 --> 01:07:31.24 That's why you have to pay attention those and I had this happen to me too. We we did an op on my first deployment
01:07:32.28 --> 01:07:34.28 We got a
01:07:34.60 --> 01:07:39.80 Piece overhead imagery and on that piece of overhead imagery there was a red axe on one of the buildings and all's like cool
01:07:39.80 --> 01:07:43.56 I mean this is early in my deployment. I'm like oh that's for the bad guys our cool we'll go get them
01:07:44.52 --> 01:07:46.52 We went out we hit this building and
01:07:47.96 --> 01:07:54.28 We cleared it you know blew the door off the hinges go in there start SSE while we're doing SSE
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:59.80 our turps are interrogating or what's the tactical questionings?
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:03.88 We don't do interrogation but do intact the questioning of the people the people are like oh no
01:08:04.20 --> 01:08:07.32 That's not me the person you're looking for is three doors down and
01:08:07.32 --> 01:08:11.000 And so we went hit it and we actually got the bad guy
01:08:11.88 --> 01:08:18.44 Well, when I got back I was I was pissed because I'm thinking a like we wrecked this person's house now
01:08:18.44 --> 01:08:22.36 You know, that's that's horrible. That's not good for our strategic vision
01:08:22.36 --> 01:08:27.72 What we're trying to get done here the guy the enemy the real bad guy could have escaped and so I asked the question
01:08:27.72 --> 01:08:31.08 I said who drew this who put this red axe on this building?
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:33.16 Yeah, who
01:08:33.16 --> 01:08:38.52 Like what was it? Who and I actually said yeah, yeah, who and why and as I dug down into it
01:08:39.32 --> 01:08:41.32 they had they had
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:43.96 through various intelligence sources
01:08:45.32 --> 01:08:46.60 narrowed it down to like
01:08:47.72 --> 01:08:49.72 this one area and
01:08:49.72 --> 01:08:54.84 this one area the center of that circle was the building with the red axe on it
01:08:56.20 --> 01:09:00.76 So that's my fault right that's my fault because I should have said okay
01:09:00.76 --> 01:09:06.84 So from then on it was my deal to say who put this red axe on why it? What does that mean?
01:09:06.84 --> 01:09:12.68 What does it mean? Yeah, I mean that red axe implied at the time that like that was the target house as opposed to
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000 He there's the center of the ring and he could be anywhere in it. You would have it plan that mission
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.52 There's there's there's five houses in this ring and it's one of them. We would have cordoned off the whole area
01:09:22.52 --> 01:09:27.96 And if you you can think about all the different ways that intel can come in and every different type of intel that you could have
01:09:27.96 --> 01:09:33.80 Could come up with you know hey here's here's the probable chances, you know it's gonna be one of these houses
01:09:34.36 --> 01:09:42.28 So that was a big lesson learned for me and you know if your people people to know when we would make a mistake like that
01:09:42.68 --> 01:09:52.28 We would obviously we what we did is we carried money we carried money and we'd pay them for the damages that we caused and and we would more than
01:09:53.48 --> 01:09:57.08 More than pay for the damages that we caused it was kind of a good deal to get your door
01:09:57.08 --> 01:09:59.08 Block off
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:03.48 No, I mean the thing is yeah, we gave him a good chunk of money and you know it was all documented
01:10:03.48 --> 01:10:08.04 We had a count for all that I mean I remember going with the logistics of that but but but
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.88 Nonetheless, I mean it's still terrifying those people who hadn't done anything wrong
01:10:13.88 --> 01:10:19.56 I was so didn't have their door blown off when trying to know it's absolutely horrible. Yeah, the money doesn't the money
01:10:19.56 --> 01:10:25.96 He doesn't it's a strategic loss. It's a strategic loss. Yeah, so that's why I was so pissed right this happened
01:10:25.96 --> 01:10:32.28 And that's why I was pissed at myself because I accepted that until as
01:10:33.16 --> 01:10:38.92 What we were just talking about hey cool there's the red X yeah, I must be the bad guy. Yeah, let's go hit that house
01:10:39.24 --> 01:10:43.08 so many examples in life and in business on that too people say something and you're like
01:10:43.88 --> 01:10:49.000 Well wait, did they say they they say they weren't gonna be there or did they say they didn't think they could be like
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.92 I mean there's just so many conversations that you can have about whether it's marketing in your business
01:10:52.92 --> 01:10:56.84 Whether there's something we doing with your family. He just clarified for a second. He really wait
01:10:57.40 --> 01:11:00.52 What did they really say did they actually say this?
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.24 One of them didn't really say that oh, okay
01:11:03.96 --> 01:11:08.12 totally changed it in it's in that moment. Yeah, it's a legend and that's in those moments as a leader
01:11:08.12 --> 01:11:11.000 It's okay well hold on before we actually go and pull the trigger on this
01:11:12.28 --> 01:11:18.52 Actually in case of combat we're figuratively right before we start marching let's just clarify real quick before we go push it off in this direction
01:11:18.52 --> 01:11:21.08 oh, yeah the the
01:11:21.08 --> 01:11:24.28 Rumor mill the gossip the he said she said
01:11:25.16 --> 01:11:31.40 Those things are just awful and as a leader you have to take a step back you can't let your emotions get a hold
01:11:31.40 --> 01:11:34.36 Being someone says oh, he said he didn't want to come to this thing
01:11:35.24 --> 01:11:36.60 Wait, oh really?
01:11:36.60 --> 01:11:39.40 Didn't want to come you didn't want to come or he
01:11:39.56 --> 01:11:44.76 His father's sick. Yeah, it's got a parent teacher conference and his kids really struggling in school right now
01:11:44.76 --> 01:11:51.64 So he he just he can't be there. Oh, well, that's a totally different story. Totally different story check
01:11:53.64 --> 01:11:54.84 Next one
01:11:54.84 --> 01:11:59.96 Battle itself provides the most reliable means of estimating the enemy boom
01:12:01.08 --> 01:12:05.24 What's the confirmation? Yeah, that's that's just legit. That's the truth
01:12:05.48 --> 01:12:10.04 Which means sometimes you got to take some risk got to take some calculated risk and figure out what's going on
01:12:10.04 --> 01:12:16.20 All of this is just is talking about preparing you know mindset the troops the tactics the techniques
01:12:16.76 --> 01:12:19.80 Logistics all of that, but now to now to okay
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:24.60 sooner or later battles going to happen. That was a tough one in Ramadi
01:12:25.96 --> 01:12:29.24 They so there would be little checkpoints out in town and
01:12:30.20 --> 01:12:33.000 The checkpoints would be run by Americans and
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.72 Then eventually there'd be run by half Americans and half Iraqis and at some point it was okay
01:12:40.76 --> 01:12:42.76 Iraqis are going to have to run this checkpoint by themselves
01:12:43.64 --> 01:12:48.12 And that was a huge risk every time to see if they could pull it off
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:52.44 Then the first several times it was not successful and
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:56.36 We would turn over the
01:12:56.36 --> 01:13:02.52 Checkpoints to the Iraqis and there was there was I think three of them got over run. Oh, yeah
01:13:02.52 --> 01:13:05.48 Over run yeah and just mass casualties
01:13:06.44 --> 01:13:11.48 But that's what we what that's a risk that the commander had to take you know that's a risk
01:13:12.52 --> 01:13:16.76 Chromic frontal and at the time had to take you had to say okay we've trained them
01:13:16.76 --> 01:13:20.20 We've we've pushed them they've been out there we've done the right seat left seat
01:13:21.48 --> 01:13:25.88 We need to see if they can maintain and we need to see what the enemy's gonna do and so
01:13:26.44 --> 01:13:30.12 The first few times it got tried it was a horrific and
01:13:30.12 --> 01:13:36.20 And eventually we did get the level of violence down and we did get the Iraqis all just trained up enough that they could handle it
01:13:36.20 --> 01:13:42.52 But it took some we had to do what we're talking about right here battle itself provides most reliable
01:13:42.60 --> 01:13:45.96 Means of estimating enemies sometimes you got to take that risk it's awful
01:13:49.72 --> 01:13:51.72 Continuing on this next little section
01:13:52.04 --> 01:13:57.08 Called estimate of it's called estimate of situation period decision period
01:13:57.08 --> 01:13:59.08 Ha
01:13:59.08 --> 01:14:08.04 An estimate of the situation provides it's pre-seeds each decision it demands rapid fought simple logical consideration of the essential details only
01:14:09.48 --> 01:14:18.04 Our mission is the basis we proceed from it and determine what it prescribes and how we can best accomplish it
01:14:20.84 --> 01:14:23.80 Rapid fought simple logical
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:30.20 You wouldn't think that you would need to tell people in the military and business in the world that hey when you're gonna make a decision
01:14:30.28 --> 01:14:38.28 You need to think simple and logical right how often do I see people making decisions that are not simple right
01:14:38.68 --> 01:14:44.84 And the logical emotional yeah just emotional decision making here this is why the and you know
01:14:45.80 --> 01:14:51.72 That general back had seen this over and over again in order to get to a point where he's making it
01:14:51.72 --> 01:14:58.36 Evident in this book that you need to be logical about your decision making process that would be like if you if you were to sit there and talk to
01:14:58.36 --> 01:15:02.44 Hey, listen guys here's the most important thing. I want to start off with about your decision making process
01:15:02.68 --> 01:15:04.04 Make sure it's logical
01:15:04.04 --> 01:15:09.56 You get laughed out of the room. We'll know kidding. Okay. Let's see what happens when we crank up the stress
01:15:10.84 --> 01:15:15.80 Yeah, people are not making logical decisions. You know when things get emotional
01:15:16.36 --> 01:15:18.36 whenever people are involved. Yes
01:15:18.36 --> 01:15:23.72 Like that's it and because that's just there's there's all those dynamics of those relationships and
01:15:24.44 --> 01:15:30.52 History and and way people talk and treat each other and it creates and then people become emotionally attached to their own plan
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:35.24 And so he has to put it in the book to codify it as you've got to be able to
01:15:35.56 --> 01:15:43.48 Unemotionally detach and analyze what is the best decision that is gonna have the biggest impact on the battlefield or the impact the battlefield
01:15:45.24 --> 01:15:46.76 Yeah
01:15:46.76 --> 01:15:52.84 The character of the hostile leader and the hostile troops it may be used in estimating the conduct of the enemy
01:15:53.16 --> 01:15:54.68 especially
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:55.96 If we have had
01:15:55.96 --> 01:16:01.24 Previous battle experience with those so you got to know you're going to guess that's patent right there. I read your book
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.16 As a determined decision
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:13.40 Must be logic must be the logical result of careful consideration of all factors the decisions made will not always correspond to the actual
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:21.000 Conditions presented this is interesting the decisions made will not always correspond to the actual conditions conditions presented
01:16:24.28 --> 01:16:28.12 Then the situation develops other than the decision
01:16:29.32 --> 01:16:30.84 contemplated
01:16:30.84 --> 01:16:31.88 he
01:16:31.88 --> 01:16:34.68 has the greatest prospect
01:16:35.64 --> 01:16:39.80 Of success who quickly and skillfully exploits other reconnaissance
01:16:39.80 --> 01:16:44.84 But does not change the decision except with compelling reasons so that's the same thing
01:16:44.84 --> 01:16:46.20 We were we were talking about earlier
01:16:46.20 --> 01:16:52.04 So you stick with your decision until you see that it's not a good decision and then you change it or you can do that
01:16:52.04 --> 01:16:57.000 Get quickly analyze that right that's how like Boyd said what they would eloup is a quick
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.16 You can go through that it would eloup than better you could out maneuver. I used to do this all the time in even it in task unit bruiser
01:17:03.96 --> 01:17:06.76 When things weren't going the way I expected them to go
01:17:07.64 --> 01:17:09.000 my
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.40 my
01:17:11.40 --> 01:17:13.000 strongest
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.60 Desire was to keep doing what we plan to do like okay look
01:17:16.60 --> 01:17:19.000 Oh we didn't expect to take contact from over there cool
01:17:19.48 --> 01:17:22.28 But we're gonna keep pressing through from the north or whatever
01:17:23.72 --> 01:17:28.60 And that was my that was my that was where I leaned toward I always leaned toward go with the plan
01:17:28.60 --> 01:17:32.52 You know plan your dive dive your plan right we stand diving here you come up with a plan
01:17:32.92 --> 01:17:37.80 You go out there everyone's walked through it everyone knows what the plan and we briefed it if you can stick with that you stick with it
01:17:37.80 --> 01:17:39.24 But
01:17:39.24 --> 01:17:45.72 Then sometimes you got to go oh, you know what I didn't expect what that and that is too big of a curve ball for us to handle
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:51.64 I'm making an adjustment we're making a call and that's where we have standard operating procedures and we make an adjustment based on something
01:17:51.80 --> 01:17:56.20 That else that we've rehearsed a thousand times. That's right, so you've got to pay attention to that
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.40 Now we get into orders. This is pretty cool
01:18:00.84 --> 01:18:05.64 The order puts the decision into effect clear orders are an essential
01:18:05.64 --> 01:18:08.92 For the frictionless cooperation of all commanders
01:18:09.72 --> 01:18:14.04 For the higher commander the written order provides the foundation for leadership
01:18:14.84 --> 01:18:19.16 It is communicated to the lower units printed as a carbon copy
01:18:19.40 --> 01:18:23.24 Type written or written by hand or by technical communications means
01:18:24.28 --> 01:18:33.08 Frequently it is dictated over the telephone in every instance the most sure and suitable method of transmission is to be chosen
01:18:33.08 --> 01:18:35.08 Should the order
01:18:36.68 --> 01:18:38.60 Should the order be simple or short?
01:18:38.60 --> 01:18:44.68 It may be orally communicated it must later however be committed to paper
01:18:46.68 --> 01:18:52.28 So this is something that I talk about a lot and I always throw out this question to trip everyone up
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:55.48 I say what's better communication email or voice?
01:18:56.04 --> 01:19:01.08 You know email or or conversation and everyone's conversation conversation conversation and and they're right, right?
01:19:01.08 --> 01:19:07.80 Yeah kind of because what goes on what goes on is if if I call you up and I say hey Andrew
01:19:08.52 --> 01:19:16.36 We're gonna do A B and C you good with that and you're like cool got it and then you go out and what I said is and what you heard
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:21.56 You do A B and D that's right and I go what would wrong with you?
01:19:22.12 --> 01:19:25.56 And you say what you told me do A B and D? No, I still do A B and C and here we go
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:30.04 We have a problem so that's why when you and I have a phone conversation I say
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:34.92 We get done and I call you and I send your email. It says hey just want to confirm we're on the same sheet
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:41.32 We're gonna do A B and C and you email me back and say no, I thought you said you want to be doing A B and D
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:42.60 No, sorry
01:19:42.60 --> 01:19:47.64 I didn't articulate it right we're definitely doing A B and C and you say okay cool got it so
01:19:48.60 --> 01:19:51.88 verbal is great voice is great phone is great. Yes
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.84 But email is very clear now you flip that over
01:19:56.84 --> 01:20:02.76 Okay, now I'm just emailing you hey Andrew do A B and C and you're like wait, why is he telling me this?
01:20:02.76 --> 01:20:05.72 Is he is he told me this because he thinks I don't know how to do this myself right?
01:20:05.72 --> 01:20:07.72 You know it's like and then we get into this whole thing. Why is he?
01:20:07.72 --> 01:20:13.96 Long email is a long super steeped long emails that you didn't don't even read the whole thing because it's too long
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:16.36 so what you want to do is you want to use both
01:20:18.44 --> 01:20:20.44 This is this stuff here
01:20:20.44 --> 01:20:30.36 The fact that this is why this is why I this is why I majored in English because when I was a young officer and I hadn't been a college yet
01:20:30.36 --> 01:20:31.32 Luckily
01:20:31.32 --> 01:20:36.28 So I was able to figure out what I wanted to majored but I could already see and there was no war going on
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:38.28 This is like 1998, 1999
01:20:38.68 --> 01:20:40.68 I could already see that the
01:20:41.08 --> 01:20:43.08 Written messages that we'd get the
01:20:43.08 --> 01:20:49.80 They were so important to be able to understand and then you had to build a right a concept of operation that made sense
01:20:50.52 --> 01:20:52.68 And so I knew I was like okay, well, I know what I'm gonna do
01:20:52.68 --> 01:20:55.32 I'm gonna get really good at this and I realized that
01:20:55.96 --> 01:21:03.16 This idea of communicating with other humans was the actual basis of of all leadership up and down the chain of command
01:21:04.04 --> 01:21:06.04 And what really helped me a lot was
01:21:07.24 --> 01:21:10.04 When I when I had to study Shakespeare in college
01:21:10.04 --> 01:21:15.56 The thing is Shakespeare is very humbling because you don't know what the freaking words mean
01:21:16.12 --> 01:21:18.12 Because they're barely English right?
01:21:18.44 --> 01:21:22.92 It's barely English and any one that says they can pick up Shakespeare and understand it is
01:21:23.48 --> 01:21:26.28 Lying either lying to you or they came from a time machine
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000 Because it doesn't happen
01:21:29.40 --> 01:21:33.72 So what I realized you know because at first you're reading Shakespeare and you're like oh, I must be stupid
01:21:34.12 --> 01:21:36.12 I'm stupid because I and you know the
01:21:36.12 --> 01:21:42.52 It's like no actually you wouldn't know that word that word hasn't been used since 1648
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:46.52 So why would you know this word? Why would you know the meaning of that word? You wouldn't know it
01:21:47.08 --> 01:21:53.72 So you have to look it up and you got I got very it's just you know what it is it's just humbling so when I would get some
01:21:54.84 --> 01:21:58.52 R-o-e from down from some rules of engagement down from the chain of command and I'd look at it
01:21:58.52 --> 01:22:03.000 Go, I'm not really sure what this means. I didn't just go. Oh, well screw it. I'll just make my best guess
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.56 No, I would get out of dictionary and look up the damn words that I didn't understand and then simple find because I you know if I don't
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:13.24 Understand what it means there's no way and hell you're in English major
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:17.96 Yeah, I'm an English major and there's no way in hell that some of our front line guys are gonna know it
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:22.20 So you got a translated form so this stuff about communications
01:22:24.20 --> 01:22:28.28 Simple it's just yeah, it's got to be simple clear concise is what we say at echelon front
01:22:28.60 --> 01:22:30.60 Simple clear concise that's the way it's got to be
01:22:30.60 --> 01:22:32.60 F-
01:22:32.60 --> 01:22:38.04 Continuing on them this is so good the more pressing the situation the shorter the order
01:22:39.16 --> 01:22:45.08 Where circumstances permit or orders are given in accordance with the terrain not the map. Oh, that's good
01:22:45.32 --> 01:22:49.88 So whatever chance whenever I can I'm actually taking you out there I'm actually looking okay Andrew
01:22:49.88 --> 01:22:54.44 You see that hey over there. I want you to get you know put some machine guns up there because we're gonna salt through
01:22:54.44 --> 01:22:57.72 You go okay got it now looking at a map. We're looking at the terrain itself
01:22:57.72 --> 01:23:01.000 How often can you actually get eyes on
01:23:01.80 --> 01:23:03.80 um
01:23:05.16 --> 01:23:10.92 In the front lines and with the lower commanders this is particularly this is particularly so
01:23:11.64 --> 01:23:16.52 We're important orders. It is often advisable to use two or more means of transmission
01:23:16.52 --> 01:23:19.32 Which is what I just said and I tell that's company's all time
01:23:19.32 --> 01:23:26.04 Hey, you want to get your you want to get your vision out to the company email it to them do a video do a conference call
01:23:26.04 --> 01:23:30.52 Do a a poster that they can do it all get that message out there
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:36.04 Do you you know I hate to say over communicate because that implies it's too much but
01:23:37.08 --> 01:23:39.08 Over communicate
01:23:39.08 --> 01:23:43.40 When I think of over creamer kids like I'm gonna send you hey Andrew I'm gonna send you 48 emails every day
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:49.32 Yeah, I would know which one I was reading here is yeah, you know how to good conversation with Sarah
01:23:49.32 --> 01:23:57.40 I'm sure I'm at the uh at mustard about this and about how in this day and age if anything people tend to over
01:23:57.40 --> 01:24:00.52 Use email and we have these just swamped in boxes and
01:24:01.08 --> 01:24:05.80 Having a in this modern day and age having a good plan in place for some comms discipline
01:24:06.52 --> 01:24:10.60 Of and it's exactly what what you said earlier and then I've been using this in business for years
01:24:10.68 --> 01:24:16.52 It's it's a conversation because you can get to the bottom line quicker because so much of the communication is
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:22.60 Non-verbal it's like tonality and then if you can do it in over a video of ETC or zoom or Skype or whatever
01:24:22.60 --> 01:24:23.64 Great
01:24:23.64 --> 01:24:27.000 So you get to the solution quicker because we're we're going back and forth on each other
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.68 We get to this we get to that final conclusion and then you follow up with an email because then it's black and white
01:24:32.68 --> 01:24:37.16 And then you have like the the confirmation of this is what we talk about it. Yeah, exactly
01:24:38.36 --> 01:24:43.16 It is easy to underestimate the time required to get in order through of that's a good one
01:24:43.16 --> 01:24:48.84 It takes me to take a little bit longer than you thought oh here we go. This is what you were just talking about too many orders
01:24:48.84 --> 01:24:51.72 Especially about all during which the communication means may
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:57.32 Miscarry produces the danger of causing injury to independence of action or lower of the lower commanders
01:24:57.56 --> 01:25:01.08 So if you're if you're trying to tell everyone exactly what to do guess what
01:25:01.72 --> 01:25:06.04 Eventually that order's not gonna get through and you know what they're doing they're waiting to hear it because you haven't
01:25:06.04 --> 01:25:11.40 Descentualized command enough you've you've trained them like a dog only to do what you tell them to do
01:25:13.88 --> 01:25:20.36 In order should shall contain all that is necessary for the lower commander to know in order for him to execute
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000 independently his task
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000 It should contain no more
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:33.08 Correspondingly the order must be brief and clear decisive in tone and complete
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:41.80 Adopted to the understanding of the receiver. Oh, that's what I just talked about adopted to the understanding so you got to translate those big words in the ROE down to the front line troops
01:25:42.52 --> 01:25:49.40 And according to conditions his peculiarity the commander must never fail to place himself in the position of the receiver
01:25:49.40 --> 01:25:54.20 I talk about perspective all the time you got to understand the perspective of the person that you're talking to
01:25:54.20 --> 01:25:57.96 They don't have all the context that you have you got to you got to recognize that
01:25:57.96 --> 01:26:02.76 The language of orders must be simple and understandable
01:26:03.40 --> 01:26:05.40 Clarity which eliminates
01:26:05.40 --> 01:26:08.28 doubts is more important than correct technique
01:26:08.76 --> 01:26:11.08 Clarity must not be sacrificed for brevity
01:26:11.80 --> 01:26:13.80 So sometimes you got to go a little bit more detail
01:26:15.80 --> 01:26:22.12 Negative expressions and changes lead to half measures and our objectionable
01:26:22.12 --> 01:26:31.96 Exaggerations are equally bad orders may bind only in so far as they correspond to the situation and its condition
01:26:32.52 --> 01:26:40.76 And its conditions so that's good one orders may bind only in so far as they correspond to the situation and its conditions
01:26:40.76 --> 01:26:43.16 So as soon as there's something outside that you can't
01:26:43.88 --> 01:26:47.96 You can't say no don't go across the line of the limit of advance ever
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:53.32 Because guess what you might get in the contact and the only way to get out of it is across that limit of advance
01:26:53.32 --> 01:26:55.32 So you better leave some flexibility in there
01:26:56.92 --> 01:27:01.16 Still it is often necessary to issue orders in uncertain situations
01:27:03.88 --> 01:27:04.60 If
01:27:04.60 --> 01:27:11.000 Change is in the situation are to be expected before the orders put in execution the order should not go into details
01:27:12.20 --> 01:27:14.84 So if you don't know really a hundred percent what can happen if you have
01:27:14.84 --> 01:27:18.84 He says still still it is often necessary to issue orders in
01:27:19.56 --> 01:27:21.56 Uncertain situation you're still gonna give orders but
01:27:22.44 --> 01:27:28.12 If change in the situation it's be expected before the orders put in execution the order should not go into details
01:27:28.44 --> 01:27:32.84 In great strategic operations especially when orders must be issued for several days in advance
01:27:33.24 --> 01:27:37.48 This extension from details is to be specifically observed
01:27:37.48 --> 01:27:43.96 The general intention is expressed the end to be achieved is especially stressed
01:27:44.84 --> 01:27:48.68 In the execution of impending action the main instructions are given
01:27:49.24 --> 01:27:58.12 The immediate conduct of the engagement is left to subordinate commanders in such a way the order is fully executed
01:27:58.12 --> 01:28:06.68 Descentualized command 100 percent mission and state. Yes, this is what we're trying to get done here's we're trying to end up
01:28:07.48 --> 01:28:09.48 Go make it happen
01:28:09.96 --> 01:28:11.96 In so far as conditions permit
01:28:11.96 --> 01:28:17.48 It is often best for the commander to clarify his intentions to his subordinates by word of mouth and discussion
01:28:18.20 --> 01:28:24.92 Yet he must not make himself dependent on his subordinates the decision in orders are therefore solely his this is
01:28:24.92 --> 01:28:29.64 Hey, you talked to your patoon chief as a patoon commander and your patoon chief is saying
01:28:30.04 --> 01:28:34.76 We should come in from the west and attack from the west and you go, okay, sounds good and then you get
01:28:35.40 --> 01:28:40.92 Hit strong forces and you failure mission your goal chief told you coming in for the witness the use of those
01:28:41.24 --> 01:28:43.24 No, shut up. It was your call
01:28:43.48 --> 01:28:45.48 He made his recommendation
01:28:45.88 --> 01:28:51.40 Continuing it is recommended that the written order which directs the activities of different elements to a common goal
01:28:51.40 --> 01:28:55.32 Be paragraph and the paragraph's numbered
01:28:55.96 --> 01:29:01.80 That's like I kind of left that in there because this is the kind of detail this manual goes into like number your paragraph
01:29:02.04 --> 01:29:04.04 Yeah
01:29:04.92 --> 01:29:08.44 That which is important should be placed first check
01:29:10.60 --> 01:29:16.92 Here we get here. This is this is good the following sequences recommended for operations orders
01:29:16.92 --> 01:29:25.40 Number one information so in the US military and in and in NATO as a matter of fact
01:29:25.40 --> 01:29:28.44 We use something called the five paragraph order smiac
01:29:29.32 --> 01:29:35.96 Situation mission execution admin logistics and command and signal that's what we use in the US military
01:29:36.28 --> 01:29:38.28 That's sort of our abbreviated
01:29:39.32 --> 01:29:45.80 True pleading procedures boom you use situation mission execution admin logistics and command and signal
01:29:45.80 --> 01:29:49.08 So here's they're talking about operational orders the first thing
01:29:50.68 --> 01:29:56.20 Information of the enemy and neighboring units in so far as this is importance of the receiver
01:29:56.28 --> 01:30:00.04 So what is that that's the situation enemy situation and friendly situation?
01:30:00.92 --> 01:30:05.56 Next the intention of the commander in so far as it is communication
01:30:06.12 --> 01:30:11.72 As it's communication is essential to the accomplishment of the end saw what is that? It's mission
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:14.76 So we've got situation mission we've got literally the exact same thing
01:30:15.88 --> 01:30:21.96 Execution is what we have next and there's is missions for the elements of the whole command
01:30:22.68 --> 01:30:27.000 What's that yeah that's that's the execution that's what we're actually gonna do
01:30:28.28 --> 01:30:31.88 for America we have admin and logistics next and
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.20 They have
01:30:34.20 --> 01:30:41.000 Orders for the light motorized columns the field trains and baggage trains the battle echelon
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.36 And the remaining reserve elements in so far as this is if an importance the troops so what's that?
01:30:46.36 --> 01:30:50.60 It's all the logistics the whole the admin and the last one we have is
01:30:52.20 --> 01:30:54.84 Command and signal which is how you're gonna communicate and where
01:30:55.40 --> 01:30:59.24 You know this is when you'd be briefing you'd say uh, you know hey as the task in commander
01:30:59.24 --> 01:31:01.24 I'm gonna be on this ridge line
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:07.80 So we have command and signal the last thing that I say is command post and communications to and from
01:31:07.80 --> 01:31:11.88 Wonder where we got some yeah, so there's the origination of smieck
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:16.92 It's you know it comes from the troop in fear
01:31:17.64 --> 01:31:21.96 That's where we got good man how this book has it has escaped
01:31:23.08 --> 01:31:27.88 Like my junior officer training you know what I mean like that's what we're trying to solve right now
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:31.40 Yeah, that's what we're trying to solve we can't solve it we can't go back in time
01:31:31.88 --> 01:31:34.12 But I promise you there are
01:31:34.12 --> 01:31:39.96 NCOs out there I talked to them all the time there are junior officers out there
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:45.08 I talked to them all the time they send me messages there are battalion commanders
01:31:45.88 --> 01:31:46.92 That
01:31:46.92 --> 01:31:53.56 That go through this and listen to it. So we're good. Yeah, we've worked we're taking care of the problems in the past
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:57.48 We're this is absolutely true. That's why I'm sitting here
01:31:57.48 --> 01:32:03.80 It's literally why I'm sitting here because I get it I get a damn email or I get a message from a Marine Corps
01:32:04.76 --> 01:32:06.28 Second lieutenant
01:32:06.28 --> 01:32:10.28 That's in the game or I get a letter from an army
01:32:11.64 --> 01:32:16.04 Sergeant that's leading a squad and it's like thank you got it
01:32:17.40 --> 01:32:22.20 I got admit when I was a junior officer. I was so busy so busy, you know
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:27.96 Rabadiers you guys can't see that like with whatever I was tasked with yeah, I'd never had time to
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:35.16 Read a book like this. I read what books I was basically forced to read and I got through them as best I could
01:32:35.72 --> 01:32:39.80 And the best leaders made me do those things because I was so darn busy
01:32:40.04 --> 01:32:42.92 It wasn't a priority in me it met 23 years old to do that
01:32:43.56 --> 01:32:47.56 But man some of these things I learned firsthand and like as you're reading them I'm like yeah
01:32:47.56 --> 01:32:49.56 Why absolutely know this to be true?
01:32:49.56 --> 01:32:54.92 But I learned it like by actually touching the hot stove myself, you know well they've berk was talking about it
01:32:55.88 --> 01:33:01.16 When he was at the basic score is like they gave him a stack of manuals and it said read the manuals
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:05.40 But the problem is you don't have a context around them. Yeah, so that makes it much much harder to read
01:33:05.40 --> 01:33:10.60 It's like distant you don't really and even for me when I when I'm reading something
01:33:12.44 --> 01:33:15.000 With all the context I have around it like when I read it
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.28 Like when I first started reading books that I knew I was gonna do on the podcast it gave me a new level of appreciation before I was reading because I was like oh, okay
01:33:22.28 --> 01:33:26.04 So here's how I'm gonna describe this to everyone because
01:33:28.04 --> 01:33:35.72 Just like we were talking about written versus email versus verbal right when you read the written word
01:33:36.20 --> 01:33:38.20 It's different than when
01:33:38.68 --> 01:33:40.68 someone is putting
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:41.88 the
01:33:41.88 --> 01:33:43.08 Influence
01:33:43.08 --> 01:33:49.48 On the right spot right the when you're using the tone and all that stuff and I mean it's that's coming from
01:33:50.60 --> 01:33:58.28 That's coming from Colonel William Reader who had him oh I was reading his book to him on this podcast
01:33:59.16 --> 01:34:05.96 And he's like this is very emotional for me because I haven't you know read this book since I wrote it and
01:34:07.48 --> 01:34:09.48 It's very
01:34:09.48 --> 01:34:11.48 Hard to listen to
01:34:11.48 --> 01:34:19.24 You know it's like yes when you add the voice it's there's something more to it and then when you have someone that's a knuckle dragger like me
01:34:19.32 --> 01:34:22.12 That says oh here's what this is here's what we're talking about here
01:34:23.16 --> 01:34:26.68 Here's what what here's what this actually means here's what this translates to
01:34:27.80 --> 01:34:32.84 On on the battlefield in the boardroom somewhere here's the way it actually works
01:34:32.84 --> 01:34:42.28 So that's what's good even though we didn't get the ideal training we can give it to them now. Yeah, and I think it's so important
01:34:42.28 --> 01:34:45.96 We talk about training and how important training is for preparation like
01:34:46.76 --> 01:34:51.32 At least at the very least hey you got to read this book at the very least okay, I mean in the absence of that
01:34:51.32 --> 01:34:56.04 It's like a complete failure, but at least go okay read these books, but you've got to find the time to do the training
01:34:56.44 --> 01:34:58.28 Read the books and then as a leader
01:34:58.28 --> 01:35:04.20 Sit down kid. What does that really mean when we go out and we operate in this way? Where are the lessons from this book that we can apply?
01:35:04.20 --> 01:35:06.84 Yeah, really do it. Yeah, you know, it's like
01:35:07.72 --> 01:35:08.68 For me
01:35:08.68 --> 01:35:13.08 What I was reading about face and I read about face like when we were in remoddy
01:35:13.08 --> 01:35:14.28 I read it for the first time
01:35:14.28 --> 01:35:16.84 I'm not sure 100% sure when I read it for the first time
01:35:16.92 --> 01:35:18.68 But I knew that when I brought it to a body
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.72 I was like that's the only book I brought with me. Wow and
01:35:22.76 --> 01:35:24.36 The thing is
01:35:24.36 --> 01:35:27.24 I would read that like I would read that to fall sleep
01:35:27.24 --> 01:35:30.68 Right, I just get up to my room. I would open up to a random page that rented enough times
01:35:30.68 --> 01:35:34.44 That I don't need to read it from cover to cover but I'd open up to a random page and I'd be like oh
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:39.000 Oh, this is this is what I'm experiencing right now. Oh, yeah, okay. He experienced the same thing
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.52 I remember one of the first nights I was there flipped it open and I start reading it and what it saying is
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:54.60 He they're working with the South Vietnamese military and the South Vietnamese military was untrained on a quipped
01:35:54.60 --> 01:36:03.40 Um, they were they were totally devoid of any kind of ethics in terms of money and you know it was cropped
01:36:04.12 --> 01:36:09.32 So I was like okay, so he so in Vietnam they were doing the exact same thing that we're dealing with here
01:36:09.32 --> 01:36:10.28 Okay cool
01:36:10.28 --> 01:36:12.28 Let's look at how he dealt with it. You know what I mean?
01:36:12.52 --> 01:36:15.56 Look there that's the person that actually made me say
01:36:16.12 --> 01:36:17.08 Okay
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:21.80 The Iraqi soldiers are not going to be like us they have a different culture
01:36:21.80 --> 01:36:26.44 They they run things a different way. It's not it's not wrong
01:36:27.24 --> 01:36:32.52 It's just different from the way we do think the classic cases the Iraqi officers
01:36:32.84 --> 01:36:36.68 Skimming money right off the enlisted guys paychecks right and
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:40.20 We're to us this is like a total
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:47.24 Total sin right the ultimate sin you're gonna steal money from your enlisted troops for them
01:36:48.12 --> 01:36:49.80 The enlisted guys
01:36:49.80 --> 01:36:55.000 That's what they expect yeah, they take he's the boss. Yeah, hey, he's gonna take a little bit. He's gonna take his little cut
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.40 Of course, he's the boss. You know what are we doing?
01:36:57.72 --> 01:37:00.84 We're he's gonna he's still generous us, you know, he's not taking all of it
01:37:00.84 --> 01:37:04.04 Right and we had to get that through our minds. You know that
01:37:04.84 --> 01:37:10.60 That that their attitude their cult their culturally different and so if we swaced a bunch of time
01:37:10.60 --> 01:37:14.36 Trying to sort out their pay they're all looking at us going what are you doing?
01:37:14.36 --> 01:37:19.96 What why are you trying to create a conflict with us we I'm the boss. I'm gonna take my cut
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:25.72 What are you talking about right to them? It's just as simple as that's how it's just how it is. Yeah, you know
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:28.76 And and so
01:37:28.76 --> 01:37:31.96 For me like reading about face that was that was the book that really
01:37:32.68 --> 01:37:34.44 Tuned me into okay
01:37:34.44 --> 01:37:36.44 There are less this here. I mean that's why
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:40.20 That's why I named task in a prison task near prison because that's what that's what hack worth did
01:37:40.44 --> 01:37:42.44 100% stolen from hack worth
01:37:42.44 --> 01:37:48.20 100% but all the little things cover movie talks about there talks about decentralized command all the time
01:37:48.20 --> 01:37:52.52 Talks about all those things are there he doesn't it's not even a leadership book it's all in there though
01:37:53.56 --> 01:37:57.000 So yes, these types of situations where
01:37:58.04 --> 01:38:00.04 The other thing that happens is
01:38:00.04 --> 01:38:04.04 Everything we've said so far right just every topic that we've talked about
01:38:04.92 --> 01:38:08.12 Is in extreme ownership it's in the dichotomy of leadership it's all in there
01:38:08.12 --> 01:38:14.52 But all of it is a different angle and just like when you when you experience the same thing
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.72 But from a little bit of different angle you know it better that's right you know it if I teach you an armlock
01:38:20.28 --> 01:38:23.000 And then dean teaches you an armlock and then Andy teaches an armlock
01:38:23.64 --> 01:38:30.44 You got little something different from each one of us. It's just a little different sign a little different movement and you get better at it
01:38:31.40 --> 01:38:35.56 Same thing happens here you you hear that same message maybe in a little different way
01:38:35.56 --> 01:38:38.92 Maybe a little different spin on it maybe shown in a different scenario
01:38:39.24 --> 01:38:44.92 You actually learn from it and that's what's important because the more you the more
01:38:46.04 --> 01:38:51.000 The more variations of the same thing you've seen the better off the better you understand it
01:38:51.32 --> 01:38:58.36 And it makes you that much better and if you see the way if you know the way broadly you see it and all things and the more you see it the more you know it
01:38:59.72 --> 01:39:01.72 So yes
01:39:02.44 --> 01:39:04.44 That's the way it should be
01:39:04.44 --> 01:39:06.44 That's the way it should be
01:39:07.16 --> 01:39:09.16 Continuing on
01:39:14.36 --> 01:39:22.04 Suppositions and expectations are to be so indicated reasons for the measures ordered belong only
01:39:22.68 --> 01:39:24.68 exceptionally in the order
01:39:24.68 --> 01:39:32.92 Detailed instructions covering all possible contingencies which are matters of training do not belong in an order
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:39.56 It's interesting they say suppositions and expectations of what we call those in the military column assumptions
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:41.96 We just talked about that. I do. Nope. Me lie
01:39:44.52 --> 01:39:46.92 It is often suitable to issue a warning order
01:39:47.80 --> 01:39:52.20 Warning order informs the latest developments of the situation it is used to affect with the most origin
01:39:52.20 --> 01:39:56.04 Preparations likewise it is used to permit the troops to come to rest
01:39:56.60 --> 01:40:04.20 Earlier and also permit them to plan to rest longer so warning order something that we also use
01:40:08.04 --> 01:40:10.04 Another section here
01:40:10.04 --> 01:40:18.28 When an order or report is transmitted orally the one bearing the order or report must repeat it to the issuing person
01:40:18.28 --> 01:40:25.32 A person transmitting a written report should be instructed as to its contents in so far as conditions permit
01:40:25.72 --> 01:40:32.04 Officers transmitting orders should as a rule be instructed as to the tactical situation. It's funny even in the teams
01:40:32.68 --> 01:40:39.80 When someone says peel right everyone repeats the call you repeat it back to the person that just told you and then you repeat it to the next person
01:40:39.80 --> 01:40:51.80 The place of the commander and his staff this is the next section we're going into the personal effect of the commander on the troops is of great importance
01:40:52.36 --> 01:41:00.92 He must be near the fighting troops the choice of location for the core commander should be based upon the requirement of the establishment of
01:41:01.24 --> 01:41:06.76 Rapid and continuous communication to the divisions and the rear. He cannot rely along technical communications
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:14.52 Meaning telephone wires and all that we can do better with this now, but back in the day and even even so
01:41:15.40 --> 01:41:18.12 There's nothing that beats face to face nothing nothing
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:24.04 Nothing beats beats face to face great distance in spite of adequate communication
01:41:24.68 --> 01:41:31.24 Facilities lengthens the command and report lines in dangers the system and may lead to
01:41:32.20 --> 01:41:34.20 late reports and orders or even
01:41:34.20 --> 01:41:43.96 Failure of arrival moral for great distance makes difficult personal terrain study and a personal knowledge of the process progress of the battle
01:41:45.40 --> 01:41:47.88 The division commander belongs with his troops
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:50.52 boom
01:41:51.24 --> 01:41:53.56 Don't get so detached
01:41:56.68 --> 01:42:02.28 This section is called and we just I just jump through a bunch of really granular tactical stuff if you're
01:42:02.28 --> 01:42:04.76 No, no, it's very good stuff to read
01:42:06.20 --> 01:42:08.20 Good to jump through it
01:42:08.60 --> 01:42:10.60 This section is called attack
01:42:10.84 --> 01:42:13.08 Which is just a worth covering it's own right?
01:42:13.88 --> 01:42:16.76 The attack is affected through movement fire thrust and through
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:24.20 Thrust and through the direction in which it is directed the attack can be directed from one direction against the front
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:30.92 But ordinarily the greatest strength is launched against the flank or the rear of the enemy more over and a
01:42:30.92 --> 01:42:34.92 Tag can be launched from several directions with a breakthrough of the hostile front
01:42:35.40 --> 01:42:39.80 New attack directions are provided so when you flank someone guess what there's gonna be other opportunities there are appear
01:42:41.08 --> 01:42:48.52 The frontal attack is the most difficult of execution yet it is the most frequent out for the outflanking attack is more efficient than the frontal
01:42:49.24 --> 01:42:55.56 simultaneously outflanking of both enemy flanks presumes considerable superiority and
01:42:55.56 --> 01:43:02.60 An development of one or both hostile flanks and reaching deep into his rear can lead to the annihilation of the enemy
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:04.84 This is something that's very tricky
01:43:05.80 --> 01:43:12.28 Because we talk about development of the enemy which means surrounding the enemy and
01:43:13.56 --> 01:43:15.96 in a small that's cool
01:43:16.76 --> 01:43:18.20 If you're in a
01:43:18.20 --> 01:43:23.80 Battalion or bigger and actually I want to say brigade or bigger like we're talking massive battle field movements
01:43:23.80 --> 01:43:30.12 Because when you get when you if you envelop if you have a if you have a company of soldiers
01:43:30.12 --> 01:43:32.60 150 soldiers and you envelop the enemy
01:43:33.16 --> 01:43:35.16 Guess what you're doing
01:43:35.16 --> 01:43:37.48 This spread then well not only you spread then
01:43:37.88 --> 01:43:41.24 When you surround the enemy you are all pointing your weapons at yourself
01:43:41.88 --> 01:43:50.04 That that's the real problem so we're in into this a lot in in the teams where guys would want to surround the target and and there's some
01:43:50.04 --> 01:43:56.60 It's problematic. It's very problematic. You have to that's why you know the classic L
01:43:56.84 --> 01:43:59.32 Shapes whether ambush or L shaped assault
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:04.68 There's a reason for that. There's a reason why the guys in Vietnam taught us to do that
01:44:05.24 --> 01:44:11.40 Because as long as you know what your fields of firearm you can you can go hot if you're in an L shaped
01:44:11.40 --> 01:44:15.80 Ambush or you're in an L shaped assault the minute I put people
01:44:15.80 --> 01:44:22.28 You know whether it's 270 degrees around the target or 360 degrees
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.20 I can't I now I have to worry about my backdrop and it's a real problem and you know what you can get away with those
01:44:28.68 --> 01:44:34.28 You can get away with enveloping a target all day long as long as there's no shooting but the minute the enemy starts shooting
01:44:34.60 --> 01:44:35.80 It's a problem
01:44:36.04 --> 01:44:39.24 So there are ways to cover exits from an L
01:44:40.28 --> 01:44:43.48 You extend that a little bit you can put some overwatches in
01:44:43.48 --> 01:44:49.64 But it is a real problem to think that you're gonna develop a target in a small you know
01:44:51.16 --> 01:44:53.32 Let's say with with direct fire weapons
01:44:54.20 --> 01:44:59.40 Company size or smaller. It's a real problem to think you're gonna be able to develop a target and not have a problem
01:44:59.88 --> 01:45:01.64 If there's a big firefight
01:45:01.64 --> 01:45:08.12 It's gonna suck. Yeah, and those lines those phase lines can get confused real quickly as we know and
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:15.48 But flanking the enemy is awesome and you should do it every opportunity you get in all aspects of life
01:45:19.32 --> 01:45:24.52 Continuing a little bit more about the development the development presumes a frontal fixation of the enemy
01:45:25.40 --> 01:45:29.08 So you you still have to lay down some sort of fire to make them
01:45:30.36 --> 01:45:32.36 Distracted
01:45:32.36 --> 01:45:38.52 The enemy is most certainly fixed if his entire front is attacked however such an attack demand strong forces
01:45:38.76 --> 01:45:41.08 Which must be absent from the enveloping wing
01:45:41.72 --> 01:45:42.92 Often therefore
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:49.16 Must the attacker be content with limited objective or faint attacks so you're trying to
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:56.20 Yeah, if you if you use every troop that you have to do the frontal front all salt well
01:45:56.20 --> 01:45:59.72 Then you've got no one left to flank. So there's another cool thing like in the teams
01:45:59.72 --> 01:46:06.52 You'd have the little assault force that was gonna move and so when I first was like going through SKT
01:46:06.84 --> 01:46:12.36 Well, we just take all the big machine gunners and put them in the base element like you guys are gonna lay down fire
01:46:12.36 --> 01:46:15.72 And then all of all the other guys with the with the M4s
01:46:16.84 --> 01:46:20.84 We would be the assault team. Well, what happens when the assault team gets compromised?
01:46:20.84 --> 01:46:27.40 They're compromised. They're compromised and now they can't advance
01:46:28.04 --> 01:46:33.72 So now they lay down and start laying down fire will now the base force just became the assault force
01:46:34.28 --> 01:46:40.28 And guess what they're holding yeah, but you have a weapon. It's they're not very they're not as mobile and even worse
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.52 The now base force all they have is M16s and they're going ping ping
01:46:46.52 --> 01:46:52.92 Right that's not gonna keep anyone's head down compared to an M60 right so I learned that very early
01:46:53.08 --> 01:46:57.72 What you don't you don't and it was great for me because that was another thing that initially taught me
01:46:57.88 --> 01:47:01.08 Hey, you got your standard operating procedures you got two squads
01:47:01.64 --> 01:47:08.20 You know you got two squads in a pertinent cool one is base one is assault don't pull the heavy weapons into the base force
01:47:08.36 --> 01:47:12.36 Because you might need them well, I think and two it's it's if the enemy
01:47:12.36 --> 01:47:18.20 In the in their he's saying well the enemy is is fixed right you have it it presumes
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:25.40 The frontal assault like that's the main effort and and but if that shifts if they become wise to the flanking maneuver
01:47:25.40 --> 01:47:32.12 And they begin to put more forces there than the whole thing just dynamically shifted around and so by loading up your base with your automatic weapons
01:47:32.92 --> 01:47:39.80 Now you're now you're totally off balance. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. These are the little things that I learned along the way
01:47:39.80 --> 01:47:46.60 Then I then I was like oh, then that makes sense. So there's a good reason to have you and a w or two and each squad us yeah
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:48.92 a w two
01:47:49.32 --> 01:47:51.32 That's the best best position
01:47:53.56 --> 01:47:57.16 Check here's talking about execution of attacks
01:47:58.52 --> 01:48:02.52 Bases of the cooperation of arms so what are we talking about here?
01:48:02.52 --> 01:48:11.88 Hmm the objective of combined arms and an attack is to bring the infantry in its decisive action against the enemy with sufficient fire power and shock
01:48:12.52 --> 01:48:18.76 Action so that is possible to drive through deeply and break down the final hostile resistance
01:48:19.08 --> 01:48:27.32 This goal is first reached when the hostile artillery is taken or is forced to retire all arms cooperating
01:48:27.32 --> 01:48:37.72 In an attack must recognize their mutual capabilities and consider their respective limitations. They require continuous close communications with one another
01:48:39.32 --> 01:48:44.92 The cooperation between the attacking infantry and the supporting artillery governs the course of the attack
01:48:45.48 --> 01:48:49.000 full cooperation must exist in time and space
01:48:49.48 --> 01:48:53.24 Throughout the attack and this is a little something that we call cover and move yeah
01:48:53.24 --> 01:48:57.88 And what's interesting is how much they talk about communication
01:48:58.44 --> 01:49:03.40 Continuous close communication with one another in the cooperation cooperation you know in the Marine Corps
01:49:04.28 --> 01:49:07.40 When we covered when when they burn and I covered
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.72 The tactics manual they call cover move
01:49:12.28 --> 01:49:16.92 Cooperation that's what they call it and so that's that I wonder where they got that from
01:49:16.92 --> 01:49:22.76 Yeah, well cooperation working together, but also look like break the word in two pieces. It's co operation
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:26.68 Right, so you have two different elements that have to even have different chains of command
01:49:26.68 --> 01:49:29.08 Right you got an artillery unit you have an infantry unit and
01:49:29.64 --> 01:49:35.88 You know we we saw this in our body, too. We're here. We are a naval forces unit with one set of communication method working with our
01:49:35.88 --> 01:49:42.04 Mean Marines use different types of communication who own the battle space. We were guests in their battle space and we had to co operate
01:49:42.04 --> 01:49:44.04 Right we had to co operate that meant
01:49:44.04 --> 01:49:52.28 Communication working together to ensure you know that synchrony of effort and without that that's when you know
01:49:52.28 --> 01:49:57.64 I wear we're gonna be operating this here. Where are you gonna be? What do you want to tell you? I got this kind of like this old
01:49:57.64 --> 01:49:59.64 You know, so we will talk like that
01:49:59.64 --> 01:50:04.12 That's not what we did and that's part of why we had successors because we co operate with the army and Marines
01:50:04.68 --> 01:50:09.56 No doubt about it continuously yeah, we cover moved with them 100%.
01:50:09.56 --> 01:50:18.12 It is the duty of both infantry and artillery just to cure their cooperation through mutual
01:50:18.12 --> 01:50:23.64 Established permanent and effective communication. What does that mean? That means you better have a relationship with them too
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:30.60 Sorry to know you're about to read what I just said no no it's good. That's that's once again proving that
01:50:31.80 --> 01:50:34.44 that actually what we're talking about is
01:50:34.44 --> 01:50:43.96 Timeless and it and it and it should be obvious to people on the battlefield. It should be obvious to people
01:50:44.84 --> 01:50:50.12 In the in the business world it should be obvious to people that are trying to work together inside of a family
01:50:50.84 --> 01:50:52.84 Should be obvious
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000 But once again
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:57.96 The reason we have a business
01:50:57.96 --> 01:51:03.80 The reason we have a business is because it's not is obvious. It's not just easy to execute this stuff
01:51:04.44 --> 01:51:10.84 As it is to read it. Yep, it takes practice and it takes technique and and the best way to get good
01:51:10.84 --> 01:51:14.12 out of this to do it but you're gonna make mistakes and you
01:51:15.72 --> 01:51:18.36 And you're gonna learn from them you well you better learn from them
01:51:19.48 --> 01:51:21.000 So
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000 That's actually a good place to wrap up this
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000 um
01:51:25.16 --> 01:51:29.64 This document, you know this document this crazy document
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:32.68 Group in furok
01:51:32.68 --> 01:51:34.68 Which is just
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000 Tons of those lessons in there and
01:51:38.28 --> 01:51:42.36 Either lessons learned most of March is lessons reinforced. That's what most of them are
01:51:42.92 --> 01:51:46.28 Simplicity of conduct will most surely obtain the objective
01:51:47.88 --> 01:51:51.32 Friction mistakes or an everyday occurrence. This is for those you out there with the
01:51:51.32 --> 01:51:54.28 Um, what do they call it? A zero defect mentality wrong
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000 People are gonna make mistakes
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.68 There's gonna be friction. There's not you're not gonna get to do anything easy for doing something easy
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:03.32 Guess what it's you shouldn't move on and find something more challenging
01:52:04.20 --> 01:52:07.72 mutual trust is the cherished form of discipline
01:52:10.52 --> 01:52:12.52 That right there
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:17.24 When you when you think of discipline as something you're gonna impose on your troops you're wrong
01:52:17.24 --> 01:52:22.28 Your wrong discipline is formulated through trust
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:27.32 Strictly maintain discipline is a better for tall and
01:52:28.68 --> 01:52:30.04 And then this one
01:52:30.04 --> 01:52:35.24 One of my favorites from this is the first demand of war is decisive action
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:38.76 Decice of action
01:52:39.08 --> 01:52:40.52 That
01:52:40.52 --> 01:52:47.000 Is what we need that's what we all need the words and the thoughts and the plans and the ideas
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.36 They all mean nothing without action
01:52:53.24 --> 01:52:57.40 And I'm definitely not saying that you don't need to think or you don't need to plan or you don't need to have ideas
01:52:57.64 --> 01:53:02.52 But I am saying that none of those things matter unless you take
01:53:03.80 --> 01:53:05.80 action
01:53:05.56 --> 01:53:07.56 So
01:53:09.32 --> 01:53:15.08 I think that's all we've got for tonight and if you want to take some action in your life and your world
01:53:15.08 --> 01:53:19.48 Here's some things that you can do change the jitsu that's a good one

01:59:26.36 --> 01:59:31.000 One of the best I think it's the best selling business book since it came out extreme ownership
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.36 That got to me leadership people say it's better interestingly enough. So get those to
01:59:37.72 --> 01:59:39.72 EF online
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:45.88 We made online training four leadership because you can't just go to one
01:59:46.60 --> 01:59:54.52 Event or read one book and think that you're all good to go you need to continually train and and that's what we made
01:59:54.52 --> 02:00:00.60 EF online for EF online dot com it is leadership training interactive leadership training
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:09.48 Online check it out and we have one more master this year. It's in Sydney, Australia all the other
02:00:09.48 --> 02:00:14.76 Mustard we did we did Chicago sold out we did Denver sold out we had to change the room around in Denver
02:00:15.72 --> 02:00:21.000 To because we had so much demand so we changed the room around that's not happening in Sydney
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.28 Sydney is absolutely going to sell out go to extreme ownership dot com if you want to come I look forward to seeing you all in Sydney
02:00:28.68 --> 02:00:30.68 And we're going to announce
02:00:30.68 --> 02:00:35.40 The 2020 dates pretty soon. How do you like mustard? Oh, mustard is amazing
02:00:35.96 --> 02:00:40.36 So good and you know teams need to come together. Yeah, you know you I mean
02:00:40.36 --> 02:00:45.08 I've gone to events for years. There's nothing like mustard. You know running a business is nothing like mustard
02:00:45.08 --> 02:00:47.08 And I'll just tell you that
02:00:47.08 --> 02:00:52.44 Come as a leader for sure the value of bringing several of your other key leaders with you
02:00:52.44 --> 02:00:56.52 So you're all hearing the material together. Yeah, it's one thing to go individually
02:00:56.52 --> 02:00:58.04 It sure that's great
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:04.12 But the tendency is to come back like Moses coming down the mountain with the tablets and everyone's you're fired up and it's like okay
02:01:04.36 --> 02:01:06.44 But when they when several of you hear it together
02:01:06.44 --> 02:01:10.92 You can really implement change in your in your organization. Yeah, that's good going and we've seen a lot more that
02:01:11.16 --> 02:01:13.16 There was some people some companies that brought
02:01:13.16 --> 02:01:17.08 20 plus that's amazing the mustard the amazing
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:21.16 Indeed, we we set aside some seats so that they could be together right you're talking about
02:01:22.36 --> 02:01:28.12 Like 20 plus people and there's there's plenty of companies that brought four yep, you know brought six
02:01:28.76 --> 02:01:30.84 Some people come alone that's fine, too
02:01:30.84 --> 02:01:39.48 But yeah, if you can bring a few people from your team and you can all hear it from the horse's mouth and you can all bounce these ideas off each other
02:01:39.56 --> 02:01:41.56 It just adds that much more to the
02:01:41.56 --> 02:01:45.72 Experience and just kind of FY when we do these we go to the hotels
02:01:46.44 --> 02:01:53.88 The hotel people are like this is the most incredible thing this is the only event where
02:01:55.16 --> 02:01:59.88 When the doors open at 745 in the morning after we do PT it's at 445
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:02.68 Combat shower
02:02:02.68 --> 02:02:10.44 When there's people lined up waiting to get in there and then every you know the hotel staff will be like everyone so proactive and nice
02:02:10.44 --> 02:02:17.80 And you know no one's rude. It's just like good people. It's awesome. Yeah, because what are people focused on people on folks not getting after it winning
02:02:18.92 --> 02:02:25.40 And and and being good and I'll tell you to just some of the knives. I don't you don't see this in other events
02:02:25.56 --> 02:02:27.80 For those you listen and life in jaco basically
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:30.44 They don't basically eat all day
02:02:30.44 --> 02:02:37.000 No, every break so called life in jaco or sitting there talking to everybody and that's something that feedback that I see consistently
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.56 People are like wow, life in jaco and all the instructors are so accessible. Yeah, so it's not like the session sessions end and
02:02:43.56 --> 02:02:47.56 Leave in jaco disappear back into their green room. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're out front
02:02:47.72 --> 02:02:52.84 So you get a lot of really good in her. I stopped saying no green room, but there is no green room at the master
02:02:53.32 --> 02:02:58.36 So where where there if you think if you want to come hang out come hang out. That's what we're doing
02:03:00.12 --> 02:03:05.24 At a course right now we have yeah, overwatch and this was cool to see this at at the master you know people say
02:03:05.24 --> 02:03:07.24 Where can I get
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:10.04 Leaders that have these
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:19.000 Principles in their brain how can I get them to my company? Well, believe me, life and I've been at getting asked that for years and so what we did was
02:03:19.48 --> 02:03:22.88 We created a company with Mike's Rally who's another
02:03:23.48 --> 02:03:29.32 Ashland front guy another one of our brothers from to you breuser and and you know he said hey look
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:37.64 He's he'd been working with veterans transitioning into the civilian sector and he said hey, let's rock this and so
02:03:37.80 --> 02:03:41.56 That's what we did great idea from Mike and so now we've got it
02:03:42.04 --> 02:03:44.04 EF Overwatch whether you're
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.04 Special operations veteran or
02:03:48.52 --> 02:03:51.80 Aviation combat aviation veteran and little news flash
02:03:53.32 --> 02:03:56.04 Coming soon we are opening it up
02:03:56.04 --> 02:04:01.80 We're we got another wing of EF Overwatch we're about to bring online which is gonna be for
02:04:02.44 --> 02:04:04.44 Everyone in the military because
02:04:04.84 --> 02:04:11.24 We the demand is so high and look you're in special operations great you got some you know you've got great leadership experience
02:04:11.24 --> 02:04:13.24 You know who else has great leadership experience
02:04:13.80 --> 02:04:18.84 In for triple tune commander right on infantry platoon sergeant so
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:20.84 We
02:04:20.84 --> 02:04:24.12 We started with the community that we know we know it best
02:04:24.12 --> 02:04:30.44 But the fact the matter is and you know this as well as anyone the the rest of the military
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:32.44 They're great people their great leaders
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.12 They've great experiences so we're creating something right now that is gonna open this up
02:04:38.12 --> 02:04:44.52 So we can plug in our great experience to military people from every branch from every
02:04:45.08 --> 02:04:46.08 MOS
02:04:46.08 --> 02:04:52.84 for every job specialty and and let them apply those leadership skills that discipline
02:04:52.84 --> 02:04:59.16 To the civilian workforce and make the veterans life better and make America better make the company's better
02:04:59.32 --> 02:05:04.68 It's just a win win so we got that rolling out the next few months, but just a heads up on that one
02:05:05.64 --> 02:05:10.20 And if you need more of this conversation because
02:05:10.60 --> 02:05:15.16 Two straight hours of me and Andrew Paul is not enough then you can find us on the in-webs
02:05:15.72 --> 02:05:17.72 We're on Twitter
02:05:17.72 --> 02:05:24.92 Instagram and we are on dying frozen block Andrew is the Andrew Paul
02:05:26.12 --> 02:05:28.36 And I am at jockel willink
02:05:30.84 --> 02:05:35.32 Andrew got any close-knots get after it every day. I love your post, you know
02:05:36.68 --> 02:05:41.000 None of us are promised tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Make us big of an impact you can every single day
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000 I've had a lot of time to think about
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.76 Life and particularly recently passing on my grandfather and other friends of ours
02:05:51.40 --> 02:05:54.52 At the end of the day we're only here on this earth for a certain amount of time
02:05:55.72 --> 02:06:01.16 And I think the biggest legacy that we can leave is how we impact the lives of other people
02:06:01.72 --> 02:06:03.72 And that can be at a small level
02:06:03.72 --> 02:06:07.96 Doesn't cost anything to say a kind word to somebody to offer some encouragement
02:06:08.68 --> 02:06:10.92 To show an act of kindness to hold the door
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:17.48 That doesn't cost anything and I think we can make a huge difference every day in just how we interact with other people
02:06:18.52 --> 02:06:23.96 In kindness and in getting after it every single day so that when I meet St. Peter at the early gates
02:06:24.92 --> 02:06:26.44 And I meet my maker
02:06:26.44 --> 02:06:28.92 He says well done good and faithful servant
02:06:28.92 --> 02:06:34.52 Chuck and it's interesting that that ties right back into this premise that as a leader
02:06:34.52 --> 02:06:43.56 One of the most important things if not the most important thing that you can do as a leader is care about your people
02:06:46.20 --> 02:06:48.20 Now
02:06:48.44 --> 02:06:50.68 We learn from military history and those
02:06:52.28 --> 02:06:54.68 Lessons are of course written in blood
02:06:56.28 --> 02:06:59.56 Written in blood by the men and women around the globe
02:06:59.56 --> 02:07:06.76 That have served that are currently serving that protect our freedom every day so thank you to all of them
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:17.32 Our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correction officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders out there

02:07:30.04 --> 02:07:35.72 Whether you're a first responder or not whether you have a mission or you just have a job
02:07:37.40 --> 02:07:40.76 No matter what situation you're in
02:07:43.32 --> 02:07:45.32 It all starts
02:07:45.32 --> 02:07:47.32 When you start
02:07:47.32 --> 02:07:59.16 When you actually start when you take decisive action that's what you need to do you need to make it happen by getting up every day
02:08:01.08 --> 02:08:03.08 Then getting after it
02:08:03.48 --> 02:08:05.48 Until next time
