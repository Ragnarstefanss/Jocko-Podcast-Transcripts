00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 147 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000 And it's been a little while since we've done some Q&A. So we're gonna do some Q&A. Cool. Thanks to everyone for the question.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000 Yes, that you have submitted to the podcast. Just to remind you, what's the best way to submit a question?
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000 The best way is Twitter or Facebook. And yeah, those are the best way to do your Facebook.
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000 My Facebook or my Twitter. I don't. The Instagram messages are just out of control. There's too many of them. And I appreciate it.
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:56.000 But I can't get a grip on them. So Twitter and people, what if it's a long question? Well, right, three Twitter statements. If it's longer than, you know, that many characters. It's probably then go to Facebook. If it's like really a long, long thing, then just go to Facebook.
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000 And send me the message. What does that call a Facebook message?
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000 Instant Messenger Direct Message. I think DM is like a content.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 Okay. Anyway, message or call on Facebook is what I get.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000 Again, I apologize. I don't get to respond to all of them. So I'm just trying to get somebody a little like, hey, I read it. Hey, thanks.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000 You know, you know what to do. Right? A lot of times people, they're just asking me because they want to get confirmed.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000 Yeah, yeah, you know, I do think I'm having problems with this girl and she cheated on me. But I don't know if I should leave or not.
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000 You know what to do, bro. You know what to do. Yeah. So speaking of, thanks for everyone for the questions.
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000 And and that being said, I still look at just about everything that comes in. Sometimes sometimes they get a little bit lost. But I look at everything that comes in.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000 Sometimes people, if you're listening, if you send me a question, some people ask me a question that I've literally been asked and we've answered on the podcast three or four times.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000 So keep listening to the podcast because if I don't say anything most likely, it's because I've answered that over.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 I've answered it two or three times.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000 Or you can do what to do just from listening to the podcast. You'll figure out, oh, I need to go get after it. Like.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000 Yeah, when in Delco, I think that it might be a good idea to have like a what are you going to call frequently asked.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 Yeah, I know. I know.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 But we do need to do that.
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.000 Yeah.
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 So let's do it.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000 Check.
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000 First question.
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000 We said that for like two years.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000 Yeah, I didn't write when I said that I'll say.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000 Yeah.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000 No.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000 No, do 10 Debbie put together like a whole thing on that. Maybe. Yeah, she did. So we could probably dig that up and actually put it to use.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000 Yeah.
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Which would be smart.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000 Yes, sir. I believe.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 I believe the same thing.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000 First question.
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000 Do you have any thoughts on what disciplines someone can use to improve their decision-making skills as a leader?
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000 Not only in keeping clarity of thought during high-pressored situations and environments,
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000 but also in making the correct decisions when it is vital.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000 Okay. So we talked about this last week.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000 You have to learn to detach and how do you learn to detach by putting yourself in stressful situations and then observing how you react.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000 So good stressful situations to put yourself in.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000 Well, what makes you stressed one thing that will make everyone stressed especially when they first start is start with you.
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000 You get to that's going to that's going to put you in stressful environments.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000 Look at sports.
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000 What are you going to do?
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000 You know, put yourself in stressful positions and sports.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000 What else makes you stressed?
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000 Public speaking.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 Right? Public speaking makes some people really stressed out.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 Start doing it more.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000 What about competition shooting where you've got a or hunting where you've got to do something in a stressful environment or
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000 archery. You know, I started archery recently.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000 You did.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000 Yeah.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000 And so that's one of those things where you've got to learn to detach,
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000 you're going to learn to pay attention to things that are going on.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000 If you're all caught up in the moment, then you're going to miss it.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000 So that's number one.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000 If you want to learn to deal with stress, put yourself in stressful situations that are under some kind of control.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 You know, even something like paintball, you know,
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000 we do gigs at echelon front when we put people through what we call FTX's,
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000 where you go out and you're going to fire.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000 We usually use airsoft because it's a little bit more.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 It's a little easier to work with.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000 But actually what we started using now is we've got things high end laser tag guns.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000 And so that's that's what we use and they are super effective.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000 They're they're awesome.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000 They're awesome training tools.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Like if we were to have them, if we would have if they would have existed,
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000 when I was in the sealed teams, I would have used them then because they're that good.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000 So we use those and we put people in stressful situation.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Go hit this target.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000 There's bad guys.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000 You know, people are going to get shot.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000 There's people yelling.
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000 Put yourself in stressful situations and learn to detach.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000 Put yourself in stressful situations with the purpose of learning to detach and
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 stepping back mentally to figure out what's going on.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000 Okay.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000 That's first part.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000 Next part is how do we make good decisions?
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Well, number one, making correct decisions.
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000 You've got a study.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000 You've got to know and understand.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 You've got to know the background.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000 You've got to know the historical outcomes of
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000 the equivalent type decisions that have happened in the past similar situations.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000 And if you know the history and you know the background,
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000 then you can use those to assess the current situation you're in.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000 And then once you assess the decisions that you can make assess the possible actions that you can take
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000 and then assess the outcomes that those decisions will have.
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000 Those actions will have.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000 And when you're doing that, you also have to assess the possibilities of inaction.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 So a lot of times people forget that one.
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000 They don't know if they should do A or B.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000 What they forget is there's also what if I don't do either.
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000 What's going to happen?
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000 Sometimes not doing either is good.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 Most that were a lot of times not doing either is bad.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 So you've got A or B. What should you do?
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000 Maybe sometimes you got to pick A or B.
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000 Sometimes occasionally it's better not to do anything.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000 And you wait and let the situation develop a little bit more.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 So the point of this is whatever you can know beforehand, you know.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 You learn, you study, you understand.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 You know the standard operating procedures.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 You know what variants variations have been made on the standard operating procedures.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 And that's how you go forward.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000 And you execute now the thing that you have to remember is that you can't know everything before hand.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000 Which is why it goes back to study and practice, detaching and making decisions.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000 So now let me dig into detachable a bit.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000 Let's actually break that down.
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Maybe some mechanical steps that you can use.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 Number one step back.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000 But literally physically take a step back from the situation that you're in and move your head and look around.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000 So when we used to shoot, they would teach us to scan.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000 Like you would have to physically move your head.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000 And what that is is a mental reminder that you need to look around and assess what's happening.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000 So once you've taken a step off the line,
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000 whether that's taken a step back from the table and you're meeting.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 If you're a firefighter and there's a fire happening,
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 take a step back so you can see the bigger picture.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000 If you're in a cop and there's a shoot out happening, where can you go to step back,
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000 get some cover and look around and see what's actually happening.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000 If you're in a conversation with someone, stop talking.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000 If there's an argument going on, stop talking, take a step back and actually listen to all the other elements that are shouting and yelling at each other.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000 If there's a decision that needs to be made,
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000 an planning situation, step back from the plan.
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000 Don't just take a step back from it.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000 Look at it more broadly.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000 So that step number one is to step back.
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000 Number two, then you're going to come up with, hey, one of the possible decisions that I can make.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000 I go this way.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000 I go ABD, ABCD.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000 I can do any one of these things.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Keep an open mind.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000 This is the problem some people have.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000 They come up with two decisions, three decisions, and they don't think about anything else.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000 So you kind of have to like repeatedly detach.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 You kind of have to stay detached.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000 That's why it's good.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000 You throw out an idea like for planning for something.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000 And I come up with three ideas.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000 I say, echo, what do you think of these?
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000 I give them to you then I step back again.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000 I keep my mind open.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000 So that's why the more you can get your subordinates to plan, the better off you're going to be.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000 The more you can get, the people below you in the chain of command to come up with an idea,
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000 or come up with the ideas, the better off you're going to be because you're not embroiled in it.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000 You're, you're de facto detached because you're letting them run with it.
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000 Then, okay, once you look at your decisions and you got to look at what the possible outcomes are.
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 What are the possible things that can happen?
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000 Is this could, how bad could this go?
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000 Risk versus reward.
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000 You got to weigh those things out and you got to do it fairly quickly.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000 And again, you got to figure out what's the result or possible outcome for inaction.
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000 And then you just weigh out these various options that you've created and you figure which one, which outcome has the most, which one makes the most sense.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000 That's, that's what's good.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000 And like I said, inaction is some people like any action is better than no action.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 Not always true, not always true.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Sometimes you can learn more by letting things develop and letting things reveal what the status is.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000 So that does make sense and sometimes you do hold off.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000 If, if you, if you can see that a problem is getting worse though,
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000 Well, then we got to do something.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000 Then generally, okay, let's make some kind of an decision very quickly.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000 Now, one of the most important things to remember, and there's a little dichotomy to this,
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000 is that you don't always have to make giant decisions.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000 You don't always have to make the, all, the, the all, powerful,
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 decision of might.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000 You know, it's like, do we go or do we not go?
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 You don't always have to say we go.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000 So I'm not even going, well, let's push a little further.
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000 Let's, let's move a little bit further before we make that decision.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000 Or hey, let's stay where we are and see if it develops or let's back up a little bit and keep watching.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000 So instead of we go or we don't go, there's actually a bunch of different decisions that you can make besides we can go or don't go.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000 There's a building, there's a bad guy in it, let's go or let's not go.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 No, actually, let's put eyes on the target for a little while.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Let's, let's call and see if there's any other intelligence.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000 Let's put a aircraft over there.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000 There's all kinds of decisions that you can make.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000 Let's push a little bit closer.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000 Let's stage.
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000 Let's monitor.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.000 So there's all kinds of decisions that you can make that allow the, the situation to develop further and maybe reveal the proper decision to you in the long run.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000 So my, my fear of saying that is that people be get paralyzed.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000 What does it analyze the parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, yeah analysis paralysis.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000 That's my fear about saying that because the dichotomy is you can sit around and analyze and figure out and look at something for, forever.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000 While the situation changes and now you lose.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000 So yes, you don't have to make giant decisions, but at the same time, you got to be decisive.
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000 There's a dichotomy.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000 Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Leadership is not easy.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000 Road all book about it. dichotomy leadership. Why? Because that's what happens.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000 So there you go.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000 That's my assessment of how you can prove your decision making skills.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000 Experience goes away.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Yes.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000 Yeah, that's one of those just kind of when you're talking about the, the results versus the, the, the method, right decision making,
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000 sometimes like the result actually both method and results kind of the value isn't even in the results.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000 It's like you haven't getting that experience going through it, you know, it'll improve your decision making.
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000 True. True.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000 Yeah.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.000 Thank you.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000 Anytime you can be in a situation where you're making decisions and getting experience out,
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000 you're going to get better at it.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000 Yeah.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000 Kind of the value in role playing.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000 That is a value.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 That's why we do a lot of role playing in our role.
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000 Kind of like a little thing.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000 And people might think like, oh, that how does that work? Come and get it.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000 I watch people all the time.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000 It totally improve as leaders because put them through role plays scenario as a leader,
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000 where they're going up against a combative subordinate or a subordinate that's lazy or a subordinate that's angry or a subordinate that that wants to leave.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000 Like you put a person role playing in those situations over and over again and they get so much better three iterations.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000 Three iterations and people are exponentially better at handling such a lot of things.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000 Yeah.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Because it's like someone, I mean, most of the time,
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000 and it was just a matter of them like never seen it before.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000 And then for you know, when it's in the during game time,
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000 it's kind of like you got to make the decision super fast.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000 You can't and a,
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.000 and a,
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000 from the role playing situation,
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000 you can analyze, you do whatever and then learn it.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000 No, that's a good one.
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000 I actually should have brought that up.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000 That's a great point is another way that you can get better at making decisions by role play.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000 For sure.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000 Give yourself the options.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000 Put, put your set set yourself up a pressure situation and have people role play it out with you of what you're going to do.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Yeah.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000 So it's kind of like like mock that.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000 That's basically, it is, it is mock experience.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000 That's basically what seal training well,
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000 not the basics.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000 He was running, but the seal training that I ran, that's basically what it was.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000 We're going to have people act like bad guys and you're going to make decisions all day long.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000 That's a role play.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Yeah.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000 Get some.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000 Yeah.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000 Like remember, and again, going back to like just seen it once.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000 All right.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000 It's a good time.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000 It's a way bigger difference than then.
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000 I mean, compared with never seen it all versus seen it once.
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000 The difference between that is way bigger than seen it twice versus once.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000 You know, if you seen it once, it's kind of like, okay, now yeah, this is like 90 day.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000 It's 90 day.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 The difference between knowledge and like, no, no knowledge is crazy.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.000 Yeah.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 And we see that over and over and over again.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000 Like on Indiana Jones and Alaska Crusade, everything now.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000 I'm pretty sure, how old is that one?
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000 Like I saw the, like that series when I was a kid.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000 I think I see it.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000 So at the end, they go through.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000 I had to see things, right?
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000 They're like these booby traps, right?
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000 They get the holy grail.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000 That's what they're doing.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Oh, then I've seen this one because everyone the guys face melts, right?
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 No, that's really the last time.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000 When they open the arc.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000 Oh, yeah.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Shut your eyes.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Yeah.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000 It's old school.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 Anyway, no, this one, they have to go through these, like,
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000 these tests or whatever.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000 They're there booby traps to get to the holy grail.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000 And one of them was you have to kneel.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000 Only the penitent man will pass.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000 That's what it says in the grail diary, which is Indiana Jones Dad's diary that
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000 took up a note and so he's like, oh, you got to interpret that, right?
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 So they had all these of people.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000 They were bad guys there too.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000 So they just send to someone in there.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000 And then the guide go in and his head gets chopped though.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000 So you go in there.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000 You know, hey, that blade is going to come chopped off my head because I
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000 seen that one guy get his head chopped off.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000 I'm just going to duck.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000 It's one time it's like I don't know.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000 The blade's going to come out.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.000 Duck.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Good point.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000 Thanks, Indie.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000 Grand, granted there was more booby traps.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000 And you kind of got to refer to the grail diary for the answers.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Subject to interpretation by the way, but same deal.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000 You see the point, all right?
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000 If you walk through a hall, I get it.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000 Yes.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000 It is chopped off.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000 You know, okay, a better duck.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000 No, you best duck.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000 Yeah, I get it.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Thank you.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000 One time.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000 That's all it takes.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Anyway, next question.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000 How do you practice normal face?
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000 So same and the reason I grew up these two questions together is because
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000 there's a little, there's some similarities there.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000 You know, how do you practice normal face, which is a legitimate skill, by the way.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000 Yes, sure.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000 It's, it's, oh, it's funny little game.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000 If you haven't heard of what you do as I used to do, my kids, I put line
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000 them up.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000 I'm a professional whatsoever besides just a normal plane face.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000 I'd hit him in the head with a, the inside cardboard roll up of a wrapping paper.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000 So there's the game.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000 And it's a lot of fun.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000 We'd have fun doing it in everyone's life.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000 Well, it's also useful in this adult to be able to not show your emotions.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000 So how do you do it?
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000 Same thing.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000 Put yourself in stressful situations.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000 And, you know, a good one is jujitsu.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000 Do you do?
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000 If you can just like act normal, even when someone's just crushing you,
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 then that's a positive thing.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000 Like, you know, sometimes you and I are rolling.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000 Yes.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And you'll be like, oh, I've found a sense of urgency.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Yes.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000 That's when I lose normal face.
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000 It's failure to, keep normal face.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000 So I get a little bit scrambled because you're going to pass or something like that.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000 And then you, you then you feel all good.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.000 Yeah.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000 Because you have me react.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000 You broke my normal face.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000 So yes, that's good.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000 I would say the thing about normal face is practice at all times.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000 You know where you practice it.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000 You practice it like when you're driving.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000 I mean, I don't can't do this anymore.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000 But when we started this podcast, I would get put questions all the time about road rage.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000 How do you prevent road rage?
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000 How do you prevent road rage?
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.000 How do you prevent road rage?
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.000 How do you prevent road rage?
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000 How do you get everyone's so in the game now that they're, they figured it out.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000 Yeah.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000 But that's a good, you know, any time where there's something bad happening, like something annoying,
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000 something like the line, the line at the DMV, the line wherever.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000 And you just just just keep normal face and just act like whatever.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000 Detach.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000 And you'll just act normal.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000 Easy money.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000 Easy money.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000 Indue.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000 Don't act hired.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000 Yeah.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000 That's like one of my, I try and maintain that rule all the time.
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000 You taught me that.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000 Oh, I don't even know if you meant to teach me that.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000 And I told the story before.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000 But I rolled it right here to get it.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000 That's it.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000 You weed rule.
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000 And I'd be tired of whatever after rolling with you.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000 And then, you know, and people do this all the time.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000 And it sticks it.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000 It's like a red flag to me.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000 Not a red flag warning of not, it just sticks out a lot when people do this.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000 After the round, they'll just flop on their back.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000 You know, like breathing all hard kind of just, you know, indicating that.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 Oh, that was a tiring round.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000 Right?
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000 You think, yeah, you need to have tiring rounds.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000 Like, again, it kind of thing.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 This is the message that you conveyed to me through your actions.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000 You didn't tell me this, but through you.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000 So I roll with you and I do that or something along those lines.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000 Oh, and you like stand up.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000 Not breathing through your mouth.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000 I remember that.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000 You're just like, you know, like, month close.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000 And then you were looking at me.
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000 Almost like you're disappointed in me.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000 I was.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000 Yeah, I know you were.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000 Now thinking back, yes, I realized you probably were.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000 And you said, you look a little tired.
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000 And then you just walked away.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.000 Mm-hmm.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000 Like, man.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 Almost like that was the bad part.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000 The part that I looked tired.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000 That was like the bad part.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000 You didn't like, can I was like, from literally from then on,
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000 I had act like I wasn't tired in between.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000 Even if I was tired, I've tried to act like I'm not tired actively.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000 That's so important.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000 Mm-hmm.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000 It's important in life.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000 Yeah.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000 You know, it's important as a leader.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 It's way more important as a leader than anything else.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000 When you start to break, think, well, I don't know if you have an example.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000 But like, I think of times in my life where I would see my leader start to break.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000 Mm-hmm.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 And just think, the cow horrible that is for the rest of the team.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000 And I'd be looking at a leader that was breaking.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000 And I'd be like, man, you aren't letting everyone down.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 And you're not going to do it to me.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000 I'm going to, you know what, actually, this is an opportunity for me.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000 If you're looking weak, I'm not going to get all aggressive.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000 But I'm going to make sure that people aren't going to follow that attitude.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000 Because that attitude is going to hurt us all.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000 Yeah.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000 So as a leader, normal face is even more important.
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.000 Yeah.
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000 I'm not saying you never show emotions.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000 This dichotomy.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000 I'm not saying never show emotions as a leader.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000 Because you absolutely do show emotions as a leader.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000 But you make sure that they're controlled.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000 You make sure they're not the most negative emotions.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000 Yeah.
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000 So am I saying to not be yourself?
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000 Yes, I am.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000 Because if your self is being a weak loser and you're in charge of a team and you show everyone that, you're wrong.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000 No, you need to stifle those emotions, which we've talked about before.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000 You need to stifle those.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000 You need to act.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000 You need to act like, hey, we're going to make this happen.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000 Yeah.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000 This doesn't mean lie to them.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000 This isn't like, hey, the boat sinking, but don't worry.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000 It's going to be okay.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000 No, hey, guess what?
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Boat sinking.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000 No, we're going to do.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000 We're going to break out of life.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000 Jack is going to farm into pool. We're going to grab whatever we can off this festival.
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000 We're going to make sure we get some, you know what I mean?
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000 Yeah.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000 Has opposed to the boat sinking.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000 Right.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.000 Yeah.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000 So you lead.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000 Jack.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000 So if, um, what, like, when your kid falls down, right?
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000 Yeah, totally.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000 Totally.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000 Like, yeah, you know what my gosh, are you okay?
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Yeah, I'm right.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000 Negative over there.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000 Yeah.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.000 Yeah.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000 Wait, how's it?
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000 I was at the park.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000 My son too.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000 Climes up high on this thing is like, slanted jungle gym kind of thing is just slanted.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000 Like, pretty high.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000 Where's not like so high that he shouldn't be up there.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000 It's not that.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000 But it's, it's high where you got to keep an eye on that thing right there.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000 And sure enough, he takes a step or whatever and just straight up falls to the ground.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000 And the ground is, ah, the ground was like a bunch of this weird hay kind of stuff.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000 So it's, it wasn't like concrete, put it that way.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000 But he fell down, full on.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 And the kind of, you know, kind of other parents are looking in my life is sitting right
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000 me kind of far away.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000 We had a gravity.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And my daughter was there.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000 She's super caring too.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000 So I'm like, I should have grabbed her too, but she's far away.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000 Anyway, so he falls down.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000 Of course, it doesn't cry.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000 It's more like surprise and stun and looking around.
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000 Almost with the look on his face like, how should I react right now?
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000 Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000 Yeah.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000 And then it's all good.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Yeah.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000 I mean, I'm not reacting.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000 Yeah.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000 So I mean, I mean, when I'm, my kids would take a day.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000 My kids would take a day.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000 I'd start laughing.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000 You know, that was awesome.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000 Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000 And then they're like, really?
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000 Yeah.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000 Yeah.
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000 That was awesome.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 We got a little scanner.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000 Nice.
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000 Oh, look, you're bleeding.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Yeah.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000 That's going to leave a cool scar.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000 Yeah.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000 You're awesome.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000 Welcome to the club.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.000 Yeah.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000 That's a good one.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Like, so like, that's awesome.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000 Yeah.
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000 Yeah.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Oh, we like, oh, I stand up strong.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000 Pripyat.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000 Kind of like you got to beat it and, like, show me how strong you are kind of thing.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 Oh, I did that the other day.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000 Oh, nonetheless.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000 Yeah.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000 So he got up and he didn't cry.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000 Of course he does.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000 He has a high ass fall to injury.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000 He landed correctly.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000 How many feet?
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 Oh, like, it was taller than I stand.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000 So we're talking to seven feet.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000 Like, seven.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000 Six.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Six.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Six.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Yeah.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Okay.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000 Over.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000 Yeah.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000 It was, it was solid.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.000 Yeah.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000 But he landed good.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000 Like, if he would have landed on his head, that's an injury straight up.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 Yeah.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000 But he, sure.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000 He felt like good, which is lucky.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000 But yeah, nonetheless.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000 So yeah.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000 If I were to, oh, gosh.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000 Oh, it, like, ran over there or something like this.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000 Oh, yeah.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000 It would have jammed him up.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Oh, yeah.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000 Isn't that why they airline pilots when you get turbulence?
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.50 They're like, hey, everybody just going and buckle your seat belts for, my feel a little
00:22:41.50 --> 00:22:44.50 bit more than, you know, instead of, hey guys, you know, we're going to repel
00:22:44.50 --> 00:22:45.50 that.
00:22:45.50 --> 00:22:46.50 We're going.
00:22:46.50 --> 00:22:47.50 Yeah.
00:22:47.50 --> 00:22:50.50 I very much appreciate that when we do that by the way.
00:22:50.50 --> 00:22:51.50 All right.
00:22:51.50 --> 00:22:52.50 So I ask questions.
00:22:52.50 --> 00:22:53.50 Next question.
00:22:53.50 --> 00:22:56.50 I tell the team, we need this done by three PM.
00:22:56.50 --> 00:22:58.000 They say, got it.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.30 We'll have it done by three PM.
00:23:00.30 --> 00:23:05.000 But they don't do it every time and tell me, well, we didn't know we needed it done by
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000 three PM.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.50 How do I take ownership of this?
00:23:08.50 --> 00:23:09.50 Yeah.
00:23:09.50 --> 00:23:12.50 This seems like a tough question, right?
00:23:12.50 --> 00:23:16.50 But it's actually not that tough of a question.
00:23:16.50 --> 00:23:18.50 Because what you think is like, well, they say they were going to get it done, then
00:23:18.50 --> 00:23:21.50 then they didn't get it done, then how can that be my fault?
00:23:21.50 --> 00:23:24.50 And maybe that's not how the question is meant.
00:23:24.50 --> 00:23:28.50 But that's the way I'm interpreting it for the purpose of this answer.
00:23:28.50 --> 00:23:29.50 Sure.
00:23:29.50 --> 00:23:32.000 Because maybe you just meant like, hey, how do I take ownership of this?
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.50 And if that's the way you meant it fine, they answer the same actually.
00:23:34.50 --> 00:23:40.000 So what happens is, if if if it happens with what happens is, if that happens with your team,
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000 then you take ownership of it by recognizing that you did not communicate effectively.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.50 Because if your team isn't doing what it is you need them to do, that is actually your fault as the team leader.
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:54.000 They either didn't understand how important it was, or they didn't understand how solid that deadline was.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.50 Or they didn't understand that when you said this thing needs to be completed by three o'clock,
00:24:00.50 --> 00:24:05.50 that you meant completed by three o'clock, maybe it's because you usually say, hey,
00:24:05.50 --> 00:24:09.50 we need this done tomorrow at two and you give them slack and they just kind of take advantage of it.
00:24:09.50 --> 00:24:11.000 blah blah blah blah.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.50 Then, you know, if you want to take ownership of it,
00:24:13.50 --> 00:24:16.000 maybe you didn't follow up enough, right?
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000 Maybe you trusted them too much.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000 Who's fault as if you trusted them so much that you just let them, you showed up at two,
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000 fifty nine is it done? Well, no, we didn't think it was due, like we didn't know you needed it.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000 Action.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 So who's fault as that? It's your fault. You trusted them too much.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000 Maybe you gave them too much leeway, right?
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000 Maybe you gave them too much leeway.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Too much decentralized command.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000 Dicotta, me leadership.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000 Maybe you went too far with decentralized command. You said, hey, get this done by three o'clock.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Figure out how everyone want to do it.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000 I'll be back at two, fifty nine and you roll out and it's not done.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 So what do you do?
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000 You come back at three o'clock.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000 It's not done. It is your fault.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000 Do you take ownership of it? You say to your team, look, hey, okay, so how do you take ownership of it?
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Cool. You fix the problem. How do you fix the problem in this case?
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000 Well, guess what? Next time I tell you something's done at three o'clock,
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 I'm going to check in with you.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000 I'm going to check in with you a few times.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000 Here's the progress that we want to make.
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 I want you to be here by this point.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000 I want you to be here by this point.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000 I want you to be here by this point.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000 And that puts a soundtrack to finish well ahead of three o'clock.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000 So let's make it happen.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000 Are you going to micromanage a little bit more? Yes, you are.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000 They missed a deadline. You're not allowed to miss deadlines.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000 Not allowed to miss deadlines. Do I micromanage you echo trust?
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000 No. Have you ever missed a deadline?
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000 No.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Well, there's been some podcasts that didn't come out on time.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 Right?
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000 Yeah, I guess they've been launched.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000 I guess, but yeah.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 There's been some podcasts that didn't come out on time.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000 Yes.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000 And I would send you a text like, hey, just wondering if you knew about a podcast that was, you know,
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000 supposed to come out five hours ago.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000 That happened one time.
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000 Well, no, two times.
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000 I think it's happened two times.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Yeah.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Yeah.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000 One of them.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000 Yeah.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000 So you don't warrant micromanagement because you, we've done a hundred and forty seven podcasts.
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000 And you've had two that were now on time.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000 Do I need a micromanage you?
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000 No, I don't.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000 Don't need to.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Because we're all good.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000 The podcast, hey, occasionally the times that they didn't come out.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000 One of them was like straight up operator error.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000 Where you were like, I didn't press the button publisher, something really lame like that.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000 Yeah.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000 The other time was like, major technical difficulty.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000 We got a problem.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000 Yeah.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000 It's going to be a couple days.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.000 Yeah.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000 Then there was another time.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000 What was the other time?
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000 When we went to Maine the first last year.
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000 And what happened?
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 We just got there on the night that I was supposed to publish it.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000 My mind was just distracted by the new.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000 I had lost my camera.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 It was a crazy time for everybody.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000 Yeah.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000 And, you know, the next morning, you so, you know,
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000 graciously posted a picture of me sleeping on the plane.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000 By the way.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000 And said, maybe someone can do it.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000 Could have published a podcast publicly, which is complete violation by the way.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000 Yeah.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000 Take picture of me sleeping.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000 But hey, the more having fun.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000 Yeah.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.000 Yeah.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000 It was actually completely warranted because it really captured like what it felt like.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 I just totally spaced it out.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000 So my point is you get stuff done on time.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000 Yeah.
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000 You have a good track record.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000 There's no need for micro management.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000 If you were, if you were hitting a lower number,
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000 you know, if every, you know, once every once a month, it wasn't on time,
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 you'd be hearing about it all the time for me.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000 I'm like, hey, we good tomorrow.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000 We good.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000 I'd be checking in with you until you got so mad at me following up with you.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000 You would just be like, hey, I got this and you would never miss it again
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000 because you didn't want to be bothered.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000 So for this one, again, it's important to remember that with the idea of extreme ownership.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000 It's not just like, oh, I'll say this is my fault.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000 No, when you're in charge of a team and something goes wrong,
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 it actually is your fault.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000 It actually is your fault.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 And that's all there is to it.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000 Maybe there's some people you need to fire because they are the,
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000 they're at fault for this mistake happening and you've let it go too long and you didn't get rid of them.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000 That's your fault.
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000 Yeah.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000 But it actually is your fault.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000 How do you take on, how do you take on a ship of it?
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000 You fix the problem.
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000 Maybe you got a, in this particular case,
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000 maybe you got to step up the micro management.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000 That's, that's the way it works.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000 Yeah, it makes sense.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000 Also to the, well,
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000 I mean, I'm speaking from a perspective of someone who could very well easily space out this project by 3pm.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000 By the way, that's potentially me.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 But this is, this is when it can happen,
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000 where, let's say I get a list of like, two thing, three things, whatever, I got to do.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Right.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000 Okay, we, you know, we want this or whatever.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000 And then, let's say it's not necessarily by 3pm.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000 Let's say it's like by next week Friday.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000 So I got, we can have to do these three things.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000 And then the next day, there's like another list of two things.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000 Then the next day after that, one thing says, hey, you know what?
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000 This is the priority three days later after this been established.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000 Hey, this is the priority.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000 Get this done first.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000 Then you got one more thing.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000 All right.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000 So this thing that I said, yeah, got it.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000 I'll have it done by Friday kind of thing.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000 Sort of get shuffled and forgot, you know, like,
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000 forgotten.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000 So maybe I didn't organize it.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000 What's your point in saying this?
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000 I just put yourself on report.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Yeah.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000 And then that you need to make a list.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000 Are you saying you need to write things down?
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000 People that miss things, you know, you do your right.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.000 I'm down.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000 I used to make little boxes.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000 I'll show you some of the checklist.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000 You come to my house.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000 I'll show you checklists.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000 I used to make there.
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000 They were psycho OCD.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Little checklist.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000 Little boxes next to like I would be going on a trip.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000 I would make a little box.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Socks t-shirts.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000 Oh, you know, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, everything.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000 Every single thing I was taken.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000 I would have on a list.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000 I still got those.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000 I got to points from the 90s of what I took on the
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000 and that's pretty legit right there.
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000 Little boxes, little boxes.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000 In the 90s, they were written down on paper.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000 Then in the 2000s, I got that computer.
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000 Cool.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000 And I print those things out.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 No.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000 So hey, yeah, people have problems.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000 If you personally are telling me that you have a problem,
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000 you got to write something down.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 Yeah.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000 So, yeah.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000 And obviously, you know, mean you're different.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000 I don't know how those kind of notes.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000 But what I'm saying is,
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000 uh, yeah, like that could be your methodology of your micro,
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000 quote unquote micro management style for things like that.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000 Well, for things like this, just make sure they got it kind of thing.
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000 Like if, for sure.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000 Yeah, for sure.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000 The things I'm thinking about.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000 In fact, you can, you can give lists.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000 I normally wouldn't have to do this.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000 But sometimes there's been a couple times in my life and career.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000 What I'd have to give people a list.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000 Like, hey, I think the box is for him.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000 Like, hey, here's what you got to get done today.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000 Yeah.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000 Make sure we understand each other.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000 I would only do that if they drop the ball a couple times.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Yeah.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000 Like, oh, they didn't get this done.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000 They didn't get that done.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000 Okay, guess what?
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000 I need to write it down.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Make sure it happens.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000 So yeah, and again, it's not like, and I'm not saying,
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000 it's not my fault because you give me too much.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000 I'm not saying that.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000 I'm saying like, not everyone, me.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000 I'm talking about me.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000 Not everyone's as organized as maybe you.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000 You know, so they're going to need some micro management in this particular way.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000 You know, maybe because maybe that's it.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000 I mean, I think the tone here, the question could be me.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000 Totally could be me mystery.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000 Yeah.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000 But it kind of seems like, hey, they said they got it.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000 And they didn't get it.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000 What more do you want from me kind of thing?
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000 You know, I think that's good.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000 We're putting it.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000 And then I just gave the list of what more you can do.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000 Yeah, you can spell it out for them.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000 You can micro manage.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000 You can check and do check ends with them.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000 Do all those things.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Yeah.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000 And then there you go.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Next question.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000 Next question.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000 You must have strong feelings about current events and politics.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000 Generally, given your experience, yet you remain silent on this issue.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000 Why?
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000 To appeal to a larger audience, or the soldiers mentality of not criticizing the commander
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000 in chief, is that why?
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000 Do I have strong feelings on current events and politics?
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000 Sure.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000 I do.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000 But they're more broad.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000 So I have very strong broad feelings on current events and politics.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000 I am a patriotic person.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000 I believe very strongly in individual freedoms of human beings.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000 I believe in having a very strong military.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000 I believe in having a small government.
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000 So I have strong feelings about those things.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.000 However, I don't have strong feelings about the nonsense and micro dramas that are on the 24-hour
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000 news cycle that are just constant social media.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000 Just constant things.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000 And we talked about this last podcast.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000 Things that don't matter.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:35.000 There's so much of the current events don't really matter in the big picture to me or even to the country.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000 And I was on Ben Shapirocho.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000 He was, I basically said, look, like, like, overall Americans have sort of the same goals.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000 And he said, I don't know if I believe that.
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000 And I said, well, I work with all kinds of companies with people all over the country.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000 And the people that I like Ben Shapiro, here's from, he's just, he's just bombarded by the
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000 extremes on both sides 24 hours a day.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000 I don't want to be in that position of getting bombarded by these extremes 24 hours a day.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000 I said, Ben, you're right.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000 There are some people in the country that believe the far left or the far right.
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000 I said, most people are concerned about their life and doing a good job and building their business or
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000 you know, patting down their mortgage.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000 That's what they're concerned about.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:39.000 And so they're not like freaking out about the little, every little micro drama that gets unleashed into the press and social media every single day.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000 And so, so why do I not join into that?
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 Because I don't want to join into that.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000 And also, I don't want to make a podcast.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000 I don't want to spend all my time making a podcast that's out of date the day it comes out.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000 But I don't want to invest my time in that.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 I don't want to.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000 And guess what?
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000 There's literally giant multi billion dollar news media outlets and guess what they do.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000 That's what they do all day.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000 That's what they do all day.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000 They make a story about this thing and that thing and this thing, I can't react fast enough.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000 It's just dumb.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000 So, if we were to be talking about current events, then by the time the podcast comes out, the current event has been over.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000 Some people are listening to this podcast and it's it's 2000 and 22 right now.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000 Right now, someone is listening to this podcast right now and it's 2022.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000 No, there's there's no topic of current events that we could talk about,
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Rare or Barely any that actually impact what's happening for years from now.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000 People, I meet people every day now.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000 I meet people that are that say, hey, oh man, I've been listening to podcasts.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 I'm on 28.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000 That's that's two years ago, right?
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000 That's two years ago.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000 What was the current events two years ago?
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000 They were totally different than they are now.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000 So, so there's that.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000 So that's why little current events thing as far as appealing to a larger audience that part of the question.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000 Well, if my goal was to appeal to a larger audience, then I think I actually would talk about this.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000 I actually would talk about the trendy stories of the day and put out little little clips of sound bites of all this stuff.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000 And instead of instead of doing what I do now, which is to read a hundred year old out of print books.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000 But that's a great way to build an audience or let's talk about the Rwandan genocide.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000 Let's talk about the Holocaust or let's talk about the rape and an king or let's talk about the me lie masker.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000 That ought to build a great audience.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000 So, so the idea that, oh, I'm trying to build a larger audience.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000 It's like, no, actually people that want to listen to this want to listen to it.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000 I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to build an audience by manipulating what I'm thinking about.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000 No, I'm actually I'm talking about and I'm diving into what I find important and what I think I can learn from.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000 And I get more out of this podcast than anybody.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000 I mean, I know a lot of people say, oh, I've got a lot from your podcast.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000 I get more out of it than anybody because I get to dive deep into this stuff and
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 really look at it.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000 So, no, it's not they trying to appeal to a larger audience.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000 In fact, if I want a larger audience, I do exactly what you're talking about.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000 As far as the soldiers mentality of not criticizing the commander and chief,
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000 if I actually don't agree, I don't agree that that's a soldiers mentality.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000 And I don't believe that it should be a soldiers mentality.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 The soldier should question their leadership.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000 And now should they do it tactfully?
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 Absolutely.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000 Because I don't want to be surrounded by Yesman.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000 That's wrong.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000 Also, if you, what am I trying, this is just a general leadership principle.
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000 What have I said a thousand times on this podcast?
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000 I'm trying to build a relationship with a person above me and the chain of command.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000 So, when I was in the military, if I wanted to have influence over my boss,
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000 over my commander and chief, what I outwardly criticize them and make them think, oh,
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000 this guy just doesn't like me.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000 I'm going to take my first chance to get rid of them or not promote it.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000 No, I'm actually going to play the game.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000 And I'm going to look and say, okay, boss, hey, I see what you're doing here.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000 I want to support what you're doing, but does this make sense?
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000 Can we do it a different way?
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000 So I'm trying to build a relationship with my boss up the chain of command.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000 I'm not trying to ostracize them by making them look bad or by openly criticizing my boss in,
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 in, you know, in the open.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Because what have I done?
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000 Is my boss going to listen to me?
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000 No.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000 Actually, my boss is going to listen to me at all.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000 So I don't want to be surrounded by yes, man.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000 But at the same time, if someone's making a bad decision, if someone's doing something that's a moral or a legal,
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000 I'll call him out on all day long.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000 Now, the other thing that happens here is this is a new world and it's a buy.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000 And this is a binary world of sound bites.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000 That's what we've done.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000 We've created this binary world of sound bites.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.000 When most answers that you want to give as a human being aren't one sentence or two sentence on the far left or far right or far light or far dark.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000 Like there's going to be, you have to explain things a little bit more.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000 And what when you take these binary sound bites, everyone's immediately thrown into an extreme category on the far left or the far right.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000 And it's soon.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000 And here's the bad part.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000 Here's the really bad part.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000 As soon as you get thrown into one of those camps, then the other camp stops listening to you completely.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000 They stop listening to you anything you say.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000 So you could you could make a great point.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000 But if you're on the other side, doesn't matter.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000 No one's listening.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000 They don't want to hear it.
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000 Because you're on the other side, you're the enemy.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000 It's a binary world.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000 You're either with me or against me and there's no in between.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000 So that's kind of what we've created.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000 And what I would rather do is have people actually listen to what I say broadly and make their own choices rather than me trying to force an opinion down their throat.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 This is the way it is.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000 This is the way it should be.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000 And by the way, just like leadership, you can't force people.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000 You can't force an opinion down someone throat.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000 You can't.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000 You can't.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000 It'll work for 30 seconds.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000 It'll work for five minutes and it'll work for five days and leadership's isn't yet.
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000 You better do what I say.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000 My way is right.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000 Eventually, you that kind of leadership does not work.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000 And it's the same thing with trying to force an opinion down someone's throat throat.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000 If you listen to what I'm saying, you can form your own opinion.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000 And I would rather have you do that because that's going to be stronger than some opinion that I tried to force down your throat.
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000 Which doesn't work by the way.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:43.000 So I would rather people listen to me and not just sound bikes and see where I'm coming from holistically and see where they can agree and disagree and see what feedback they give me.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000 Because by the way, I could be wrong about something which I have no problem with.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000 But I would rather do that.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:01.000 I would rather have that approach than join the pack, whichever pack that is joined the pack on the street and bark loudly like the rest of the dogs.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000 I have no interest in doing that.
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000 So there you go.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000 Okay.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000 Thank you, girl.
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000 Yeah. And it's funny, man.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000 You're like one of the few people who, I mean, I, you know, like that.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Hold to me to sum that up.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 I mean, I've heard that before or where someone would be like, hey, I'm, you know, I'm like this one.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000 But it's so very, it's so few people that actually do that the way the way you do even in real life, like in real life.
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000 Like you, you don't even want political stuff will come up.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000 It's real obvious that you didn't jump into any specific group.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000 So well, this, this really ties back to last week's podcast of getting involved in things that don't matter.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000 And there is, there is just so much out there that doesn't matter.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000 Now, where you have to be careful is that that, that there's so many things that don't matter.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000 But what I am not saying that little things don't matter.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000 You see what I'm saying?
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000 There's a huge disparity between those two things.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000 A lot of things that don't matter. What I am not saying is that little things don't matter.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Because there are little things that do matter.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000 And the classic example that we brought up over and over again on this podcast is like, oh, the Russian soldiers not shaving in Chechnya.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000 And how that led to their, eventually, okay, not going to shave.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000 Now we're not going to clean our weapons now, but now we're not going to stay awake on a watch.
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000 Now we're not going to execute the missions we're being told to do now we're getting beat.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000 There are little things that matter.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000 If I'm barking all day long about things that don't matter, then we have a problem.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000 We have a problem. Now I'll tell you something else.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000 There's been some issues that have come up lately.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000 There is one issue that I was going to address on the podcast, but
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000 And I still might address it because it's a small problem that I see as being a more significant problem.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000 And if it continues down the road, but luckily, at this point,
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000 there's there's a whole pack of dogs barking about it.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000 It wasn't like, it wasn't like I noticed this problem, no one else saw it.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000 It was like I noticed this problem, so did millions of other people.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000 And they all those dogs start barking. Okay, so now what am I going to do?
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:24.000 It's a park with them. It's like, okay, now if there comes a time where all of a sudden I realize there's one of these small things that matter or a big things that matter.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000 That I don't see getting the traction that it needs.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000 Well, then I will absolutely say, hey, this is what I think about this situation.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000 Generally, there's so many people barking.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000 And they're barking about the same thing. They're barking about a lot of things that don't matter.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000 They're barking about some things that matter.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000 And right now, unless I mean, what do I say all the time, unless you speak to more people listen?
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000 Yeah. So if I want to give my opinion on the daily news every hour on the hour, no one's listening to anything I've got to say.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000 And then it's a waste. It's a waste of my time because there's more important things.
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000 When we can when we can dive into human nature through the lens of war, through the lens of leadership through the war of a trust, if we can learn and teach people about the past so that we can prevent it from happening in the future.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000 That to me is infinitely more impactful than barking about some current event that's happening that's going to be gone in a week.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000 It's amazing how fast stuff comes up on the raiders.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000 All of the headlines and in a week it's gone in a week it's gone.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Yeah.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000 So I'm just not going to play that game. I don't.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000 There's no point in doing it.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000 That's a really good way to put it. It's like these current events. Most of the time seem to be shaped in a way to just for dogs to bark about.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 You know, like that's what it is. I can't.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000 And then they bark in the next thing.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000 You know, yeah. Okay, bark about this now.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000 The sound bite thing is really interesting too.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000 The everything is a sound bite and it either puts you in one camper or the other camp.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000 And the fact of the matter is you can't put me in a camp.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000 You can't because I got beliefs that you don't understand on one side on the other side.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000 Yeah.
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000 You know, and so you can't talk to me about that kind of thing.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000 You can't, not that you can't talk. You can't put me in a camp.
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000 But the instinct of the world right now is take that person and put him in a camp.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000 I'm not going in the camp. That's what's happening.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000 If you want to figure out what I'm thinking, listen, what I'm saying about,
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Listen to what I'm saying in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000 where I talk about human nature, right?
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000 If you want to figure that out and then you want to ask me a point of question about something cool.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000 Ask it. Bring it.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000 If it's something that's going to be food.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000 If it's a bark, if you want me to bark about something, I'm probably not going to bark about it.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000 So what?
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000 Throwing you in a camp, all you'd have is a whole lot of unhappy campers?
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000 No, you throw me in a camp.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000 If you put me in one camp, the other camp doesn't listen anymore.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000 And that means their minds are closed, so they're not going to...
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000 And the fact the matter is, there's good people in both camps.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000 And both people can be... can change and can accept new ideas.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000 If their mind is open, if their mind is open, they're just staying there camp.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000 And everyone else, I mean, when you watch the extremes of either camp right now,
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000 it's like, it's like really? It's... it's bizarre a world.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000 Yeah, it's kind of odd.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000 So you just sit there and say, okay, why am I going to play that game?
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000 Let's just become better people that understand people better and will make better.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000 I would make the place, make the world better.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000 Can't disagree.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000 Yeah, the whole unhappy campers, those mean more making a joke?
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000 I did it.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.000 Yeah, I know.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000 Yeah, I was good attempted humor.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000 Well, I actually know it wasn't.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000 There's a failure, but that's cool.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000 What was the other point you made?
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000 Sometimes it's better to just try, you know?
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.000 And...
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Oh, they would have...
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.000 See what up, now I know.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000 No, no, you know, don't try that again.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000 No more jokes from that control.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000 I'm going to learn from it.
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Might mistake.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000 Anyway, next question.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000 What is the best way to break through a plateau in juditsu?
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000 I'm stuck doing the same moves against the same training point as it has the same moves done to me.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000 Beating the same guys and getting beat by the same guys.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000 What should I do?
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000 What should I do?
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000 Well, I'll tell you what I would do.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000 Going a crazy training bench.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000 Yeah.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000 Take a week off from work and train eight hours a day.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Just get crazy.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000 Make sure you're healthy and then take a week off and train eight hours a day.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000 Like nuts.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000 That's number one.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000 Number two, you could also opposite.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000 Take a short break.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000 Take a little time.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000 Don't take a long break.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000 Take a little step back.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000 That's another option.
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000 Another option is only start working on certain moves.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000 Like only utilize one.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000 Like, okay, so every time you get arm lock from the bottom of you, you got to be your guard player.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000 Don't play guard anymore.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Don't play guard anymore.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Start just look, I'm not going to play guard every time I'm going to come up and I'm going to get this.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000 I'm going to go for a single leg from the bottom.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Like Dean does.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000 I'm going to do that every time until I start making a work, that's what I'm going to do.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000 And if I get choked a thousand times, that's fine because I'm going to get better out of
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000 Eventually.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000 And the other thing is train like, you know, you get your little click of training partners at
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000 your gym, start training with some of the other people that have different body styles and
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000 different body shapes.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000 So you get used to, you have to bring out a new part of your game.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000 The first one that I talked about, training bench eight hours a day.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000 I know it's hard for people to actually make that happen.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000 It's not perfect.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000 The times that I've done that, the first time I did it, I actually do it at the time that I taught the
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000 the jacco, the jit-jit for offense, the jit-jitsu offense for combat killing operations.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000 The jacco course.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000 And I trained these guys.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000 It was a small group.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000 It was like five of us.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000 And we trained all day.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000 And one of the guys was equivalent to me.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000 Dan, he was like, we were both like blue belts.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000 And so we, not only were teaching people, but we were training long.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000 And like my jit-jitsu visibly got better in a five day period.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000 Because I trained super hard for five straight is.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000 So that's a cool way.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000 You could probably do it for a weekend.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000 You know, probably just got three take a Friday off, train Friday Saturday, Sunday,
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000 eight hours a day.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000 We're going some stuff.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000 Yeah.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000 Be careful when you know, because you get your overuse injuries and order,
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000 you get when you're tired, you're more likely to get hurt.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000 So you got to use a little caution.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000 But those are some good ways to break your platos in jit-jitsu,
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 which we all, we all hit.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000 Yeah.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000 One way to know that you're breaking your platos,
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000 you're going to get worse first.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000 You're going to get, you're going to lose.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 You're going to lose to some of these guys that you have been tapping.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000 You're trying something new.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000 Yeah.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.000 Yeah.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000 That is indicator for sure.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000 I like the do certain moves or omit certain moves.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 Because like, it's a natural thing where like you,
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000 when you're, when you're ascending, right?
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000 When you're, when you're training,
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000 you kind of settle into a certain type of game.
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000 You know, so maybe yeah, you like to play guard a lot.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000 Maybe like to get the triangle from the guard a lot.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000 That's your kind of go-to, you know?
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000 Where it all, it becomes sort of this almost like a muscle memory kind of thing.
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000 Where it's like boom, you'll pull guard, you're routine in a row,
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000 no matter who you're going against.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000 It's kind of real similar all the time.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000 Right?
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000 So yeah, if you start omitting that stuff,
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000 where's like, okay, I'm not,
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000 I won't go for that triangle anymore.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000 I'll play guard, but it cannot do the triangle,
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000 so it forces you to do other stuff.
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000 And then sometimes depending on your experience,
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000 you might have two, three, four go-toes, right?
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 So you still, you're still kind of trapped in that same plateau
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000 but if you just omit one move.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000 So in that case, you think of a move that you might notice
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000 other people getting a lot, not necessarily on you,
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000 but you know, just in general, and be like,
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000 hey, that's all I'm gonna do.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000 I can't get any other submission.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000 I can't.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000 I can only do, I don't know, the guillotine, for example.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000 Right? Let's say you, you just don't do guillotines that much,
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 or whatever.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 I know you can't relate to that.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000 But you say, okay, I'm only going for guillotine.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000 If I'm like in my guard, I can't really, like,
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000 I can't really get a guillotine from the guard or whatever.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000 And put it this way if you're not good at guillotines.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000 That'll force you to find ways to get a guillotine.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 It'll force you.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000 And then if you do that for,
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 why don't we out say maybe even like three months,
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000 maybe in six months, Brian Sergeant was like, hey,
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000 yeah, like what I did?
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000 Like, because he likes to plant up,
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000 smash from the top.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 He's like, I didn't just, for six months,
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000 I just didn't plant up.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000 Mm-hmm.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000 Well, that might have been you.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 I said that.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.000 I don't know.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000 Why don't you guys said that?
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000 That definitely happened with me.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.000 Yeah.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 It definitely happened with me.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 I didn't like being on the bottom.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000 Yeah.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000 And then I just, this is like, okay.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000 Yeah.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 No sweeps allowed.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000 No, like, starting from the top.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000 If you're, if you're starting, you pull guard.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000 That's it.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000 Like, no, that's your rule.
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000 And that's the thing.
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000 It's hard to, like,
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000 it's hard to come to training.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Unless you have this plan in your mind set.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000 It's hard to come to training.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000 Be like, you know what?
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000 I think I'm going to just only play guard today
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000 if, like, you don't like guard.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.000 Mm-hmm.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000 Because it's like, I don't want to get, like,
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000 tapped out for everybody, you know?
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Especially when you just got your purple belt.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.000 Yeah.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 You know, or something like this?
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000 It's hard to do that.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000 But yeah, if you just make up your mind,
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000 kind of think of it long term,
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000 like I'm playing the long game here,
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000 and just only go for that certain move that you want to get.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000 That's all you're doing.
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000 It'll, that'll bust.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000 You put, put, pass the plateau easy.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000 It'll, I don't know about easy.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000 Well, it's a good way to work through your plateau.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000 But I think that's a very high probability
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 that you'll, you'll get past it.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000 And also, uh, just not easy.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000 No, no, no, no, no.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000 Cause you just have to work your plateau easy.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000 It's not easy.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000 Yeah, but it's actually hard.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:53.000 Okay.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000 And I just don't, I just want to make sure
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000 people aren't like, oh, you know,
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000 Echo said to just try one move,
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000 and then it's going to be easy to break the note.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000 Yeah, that's actually not true.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000 Yeah.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000 It's actually hard.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000 It's, it's hard to not just resort back to what you're good at.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000 And be when you don't resort to what you're good at,
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000 you get your ass kicked on a regular basis, which is not fun.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000 Yeah.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000 So it's easy.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000 Yeah.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000 And that easily could be the two main challenges of
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000 going through due to journeys.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000 Those two things.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000 Yeah.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Arguably.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000 Yes, you're right.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000 Correct.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000 That is absolutely correct.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000 If that's what you mean by easy.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000 What a kind of sort of meant was.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000 Yeah.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000 The properly breaking past the surf spot that I surf at.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000 Yes.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000 And one of the ways to get out of the water is dangerous,
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000 but fast.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000 The other way to get out of the water is mellow,
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000 but it's a longer walk.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000 And I was surfing with my buddy,
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000 Stoner.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000 And he's like,
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000 Hey, which way is it easier to get out?
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000 And I said, well, bro, depends on which way.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000 It's easier to be easy.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000 If you mean me, you need to get out there.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000 Because one of them is not more than a few steps once you're good.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.000 Yeah.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000 But getting good is getting to that point is a challenge.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000 The other way is really easy, but it's a long walk.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000 So it just depends on which you mean my easy.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Yeah.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Yeah.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000 So I mean to me.
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000 Probability wise.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000 Let's say if you chose to break through your plateau,
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000 by going to another gym to train with all different guys.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000 That would get your plateau.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000 But I think if you did this thing where you owe me a certain move,
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000 or you just add a move they're not good,
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 and that's only what if you did that and really committed to it,
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 correctly, which is hard.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000 By the way, mentally, but if you did that,
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000 I think the probability of you breaking past your plateau
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000 and ending up at a further place in regards to progress
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000 is much higher if you did that.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000 Yeah.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000 That's what I think.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 And that's what I meant by easy, which I guess.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Yeah.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000 To show you, you use the word easy.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000 Depends what you mean by easy.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000 You can also do tournaments, planning.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000 If you do a lot of tournaments, you'll bust past the plateau.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Yeah.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 Weaknesses will be exposed.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000 Yeah.
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000 And it's like, your mind will be way more eddies in training too.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000 It'll be like more, oh, yes, weird.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000 For sure.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000 I think so.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000 Anyway, next question.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000 How do you apply the principle of building a relationship with your boss
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000 when your boss doesn't value relationships?
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000 For example, he consistently avoids interactions that don't lead directly to a deliverable
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000 on a current objective.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000 He avoids all other interactions such as those that are for the purpose of building
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000 relationships and chemistry within the team.
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000 Okay.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000 What would I do in that situation?
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Well, then, okay, obviously, what I would do is I would build a relationship based on deliverable
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000 current objectives.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000 Right?
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000 If that's what he's into, I'm going to make that happen.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000 Like, I'm going to be the guy that he thinks can get this to happen.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 And that's what our relationship is going to be based on.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000 And I'm fine with that when he wants to talk about work, I'll talk about work.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000 I had bosses like that.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000 I had plenty of bosses like that.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000 And what do you do when you have bosses like that and play the game?
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000 Like, okay, we're going to, let's just make this happen.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000 Let's do this.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000 Now, let me say this.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000 Because he isn't personable.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000 This means that you have to be more personable, not somewhat with him,
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:31.000 but with the rest of the team, because there's a lacking element within the team that you as a good
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:38.000 team player and team member and leader, whether you're in a positional leadership or just a human leader,
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000 you can improve the team by building some of that human connection that bonds the team more.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000 So, even though my boss is impersonable and is just about the business and just about the current objective,
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000 that's fine with me.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000 I'm going to do my best to support him and make him realize that I'm going to got the guy that's going to make those objectives work.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000 And I'm going to build the human connection with the rest of the team, which will make our team stronger.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000 Now, I'm not going to offend my boss by being the guy that is more popular than him.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.000 Some people have some people that have the attitude that this individuals talking about,
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000 what would you call this person?
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Just like 100% work focused.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000 If I got a guy that's 100% work focused, sometimes that kind of boss finds the person that wants to chat,
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 annoying, right?
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000 Unknowing, which is possible.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000 So, you don't want to be, you don't want to annoy the boss and he thinks all this,
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000 all this guy, Joggoy just wants to build friends. He's not here to work.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000 No, you've got to be careful about that.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000 And the weird thing is, honestly, I'm very work focused.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000 I'm very work focused.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000 And I have to do more, but I just think I have to consciously think about, okay, on top of it.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000 Actually, I still do have to do it sometimes.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000 You know, like, I have to consciously think about, like, okay, I also need to like,
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000 be nice and build relationship with the person that I've don't.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000 Normally interact with, right?
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000 So, you do have to do that.
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:25.000 So, from the relationship with the rest of the team, the good relationship, and then from the best relationship that you can with the boss,
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000 and that is going to help the whole team. That's it. It's as simple as that.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000 And I'll say one more thing about this.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000 You don't get to pick your leader.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000 Generally, you don't get to pick your leader.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000 But you can pick the relationship that you have with your leader.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000 So, what your leaders into? Let's get in the game. Let's build a good relationship.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Once again, if someone's out there thinking, oh, so you just want me to kiss ass.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000 What I'm saying is not that I want you to kiss ass.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000 I'm saying I want you to win. That's what I'm saying.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000 Because the better relationship you build with your boss, the more influence you have over the better chance you have of getting promoted,
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000 the better chance you have of accomplices in the mission and taking care of your team.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000 That's the way it works. Why don't you want to get promoted?
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000 So, I can get more money from myself. No, I want to get promoted.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000 So, I can do the mission. So, I can take care of my team. That's why I want to get promoted.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000 If it was just about like taking care of myself, I wouldn't go work for this guy.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000 I'd go find another job and pick a different boss.
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000 Because you do get to pick your boss. You can quit your job.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000 Quit your day job.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000 So, that's what you do. You build that relationship.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000 How does it is? Get some.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000 Yeah, that's a good point with the details of it.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000 You can't just start trying to chat the guy up.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000 No, it's not. You just like that.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000 Yeah, no one does actually. Even if you're a social person,
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000 but you're just focused on something.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000 Yeah.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000 And, I don't know. You're focusing on your friend calls you.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000 They call me, it might be important.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 Me, you're talking.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000 Yeah, and they're telling you about the episode of whatever last night.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000 And you're like, Brad, I'm working right now.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Brad and watch TV.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000 Yeah.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.000 Oh, yeah.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Now you're going to step further than I had in my book.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000 I'm just saying that that's annoying no matter who you are.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000 So, if you're thinking, you know, this boss is like he doesn't like the quote unquote build
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000 Build relationship and like all the stuff.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000 He's only then you're going to, you run that risk of annoying him.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000 Yes, you can be a sister.
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000 You got a big step back to my economy.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000 That kind of thing.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000 But there's little, and usually it has to do with time too.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.000 You know, so if you go in and you just go just little digs of like relationship building stuff,
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 but not don't take, don't go in there and be like, hey,
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000 did you catch the game last night?
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000 Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000 I don't want to talk about it.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000 I don't care.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000 But, you know, I don't know.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000 Nice tie.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000 Boom, out.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000 You know, kind of big.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000 I don't know.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000 Don't say nice tie.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000 No, don't.
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000 Next question.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000 The guy that's high level worker does not want to hear about his tie.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000 It's not care about his tie.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000 Yeah.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000 A lot of people.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000 But yeah, and I don't know how to get in the corporate scenario.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000 I think my whole life, but.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000 So I don't know that I just seem like something on the move.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000 It's a long thing about your shirt.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000 That wasn't corporate.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000 That was a big club.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000 But yeah.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Leadership.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 Yeah, same cut for sure.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000 And the point is there's things you can say that don't take up his time and necessarily
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000 his full attention to annoy him that you can say or do.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000 It's what I'm saying.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000 I don't know what that is because I don't.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000 I don't.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000 I don't work with you guys.
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000 Check.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000 Next question.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Hey, Jockel.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000 My boss is trying to implement, let's say boss.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000 Let's say, boss.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000 I don't know why it's it's highlighting.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000 Oh, my boss is.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000 So.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000 Where it works, man.
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000 Somebody was talking about on social media.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000 How you said, peace.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000 You're like, I went to the grocery store.
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000 I got some peace.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000 So, you know.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000 It's a, you know, variable.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000 I don't know.
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000 I see that.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000 Not the variable escalation.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000 Sure.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000 My boss is trying to implement a process that I see the end result not being what is needed.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000 And I have proposed an alternative that is proven and will add value to the company.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000 Do I give up trying to position to get the outcome we need or do I commit to help
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000 implement his process and wait for outcome then trying it?
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000 It is a relatively small failure in the big picture outcome, but would like some input on how
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000 to get the results we need long term.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000 Very cool question.
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000 And so, yeah, you got a scenario where your boss wants to do something.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000 You know you got a better idea that'll work better.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000 What do you do?
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000 Well, first of all, anyway, that I can make my idea and his idea, that's what I'm going to try
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000 and do.
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000 So, you have to be careful.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000 And again, I don't know what your boss might be an open minded person.
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000 If you've got a good leader, you can go there and say, hey, boss is what you're trying
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000 to make happen.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000 I think this will work better and your boss make, oh, wow, that's a great idea.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000 You know what?
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000 Let's go with that.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000 There's leaders like there out there that make it happen.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000 You're probably not asking this question if you have that kind of boss.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000 You're probably talking about someone that has a little bit more ego.
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000 Things they know a little bit more and not really open minded to new ideas.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000 And that's why making your idea and his idea is going to be a better option.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000 Don't try and force your idea.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000 And one thing you do is you could ask questions and I've talked about this before, but like,
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000 you say something like, you know, hey, boss, I want to make sure that I'm supporting this in the best way possible.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000 So, I really want to understand this fully.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000 So, can you explain this here to me and why we're doing it like that?
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000 And then you know you have a conversation with your boss and then you go, oh,
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000 and maybe your boss has some good points that you didn't understand or maybe that opens the door
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000 for you to say, hey, boss, the way that this other group is doing it is like this.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000 Do you think we could try that?
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000 Or you say, if you want to ego him up a little bit, like, hey, boss, you know, I don't,
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000 boss, you know, I don't, I don't fully understand this, you know, as well as you do,
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000 could you just help me understand why we're doing it this way?
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000 And then once again, what you're doing is you're starting a conversation.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000 If you can't get the message across in that indirect manner,
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000 you can be a little bit more direct, but be careful when you're direct with people.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000 They dig in, man.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000 They dig in, especially with anyone with any kind of ego.
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000 You go, they dig in.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000 You tell them your idea and they just, all of a sudden, they come up with reasons not to,
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000 do it and you have to be careful.
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000 That's why you have to use caution when you reveal your plan.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000 It's better to not even reveal it as your plan.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000 It's better to reveal it as like an idea and then let it become their plan.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Don't reveal your emotions.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000 Okay, now all that fails.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000 This guy's just dead set.
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000 Hey, we're doing it my way.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000 Shut up echo.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000 We're not listening to your plan.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000 We're doing it my way.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Then what you do?
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000 Yeah, you go all in.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000 What about the best, the best ability you, you try and learn what they want,
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000 you try and execute what they want, you try and understand what they want better than anyone else including him.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000 So that way you go out, you execute, you know where all the weaknesses are.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000 Now you learn and now you can come back with a better argument,
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000 or a better seeded plan in their head, hey boss, I know your plan.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000 It's working really, really well and one thing that we could do to make it even better.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.28 better. I think what do you think of this if we did XYZ instead of XYB? I think it might work
01:04:17.28 --> 01:04:23.60 a little bit better. What do you think? And then you, again, you plant this, you plant the team.
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:27.12 And maybe, I mean, you plant the seed. And maybe you can incorporate, you know, there's times
01:04:27.12 --> 01:04:30.80 where there's times where I did this. Oh, that's what you want to do, boss. Cool. God, yep,
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:35.20 that's what we're going to do. Going to do something. Same result, get the same result but do it
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:42.16 a different way. You know, it's the ask for better to ask for forgiveness than per mesh. Yeah,
01:04:42.16 --> 01:04:47.12 than per mesh. So sometimes it's like, it's like the again, we're going back to the idea of things
01:04:47.12 --> 01:04:51.36 that don't matter. If my boss wants me to do it one way and I can do it just a little bit different
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:55.28 and no one's going to know and it's going to be all good and our results going to be the better or
01:04:55.28 --> 01:04:59.76 the same. I'm probably just going to be like, hey, boss, I got it. And then hey, boss, yeah, on the fly,
01:04:59.76 --> 01:05:06.48 we made a little call here. We went with a, y, b or Z, d, a instead of Z, d, b. I hope it's not, you know,
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:10.40 bad, but here's the results, by the way, we did it an even shorter time. And the boss goes, oh, yeah,
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:14.08 that's cool. There's no big deal because he sees the results. He wants to take a little bit
01:05:14.08 --> 01:05:22.56 credit forms. So again, once this about this is about building the relationship. So let me ask you this.
01:05:22.56 --> 01:05:31.84 This is, this is an important, a good question to ask yourself. Will, what will help the team more?
01:05:32.72 --> 01:05:38.64 What will help the team more? Will it help the team more to disrupt the relationship and undermine the boss?
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:45.84 Will that, will that help the team? No. Will it help the team if you create an antagonistic relationship
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:51.12 with your boss? No, that won't help your team. Will it help your team if you build the relationship
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:55.84 with your boss if you unify the team? If you strengthen the team and you bring everyone together,
01:05:55.84 --> 01:05:59.20 will that help the team? Yes, it will help the team. Will that build the relationship with your boss?
01:05:59.20 --> 01:06:02.56 Yes, it will build the relationship with your boss. If you have a better relationship with your boss,
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:09.20 is your boss more likely to accept the influence that you're throwing at him? Yes, absolutely.
01:06:10.32 --> 01:06:16.72 So I think that's something you can ask yourself a lot. Is what I am trying to do
01:06:16.72 --> 01:06:21.84 you're going to help the team or her to team and you actually have to look at those two in the long term in the
01:06:21.84 --> 01:06:25.84 short term. Because sometimes you do something that hurts the team right now. It'll help the team later.
01:06:25.84 --> 01:06:31.04 Like for instance, hey, we're going to fire a guy. Everyone loves him, but it's going to disrupt the team,
01:06:31.04 --> 01:06:36.56 but long term will be better off. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it's like we're going to fire this guy,
01:06:36.88 --> 01:06:40.88 everyone loves him and it's going to be a long term down. It's going to be a long term detriment
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:45.92 that you made this call. So you have to check yourself and check what's going to help the long term
01:06:45.92 --> 01:06:49.76 short term of the team is going to make it better. It's going to make it worse. In this case,
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:57.44 try to make your plan your boss's plan. If you can't, then support build relationships and influence
01:06:57.44 --> 01:07:01.92 over the long term, especially because this guy very smart to mention that this is a relatively
01:07:01.92 --> 01:07:07.36 small failure. Like this is an acute risk. You can, hey boss, you know what, we got it done,
01:07:07.36 --> 01:07:11.36 didn't quite got to come the same way. Here's what we're going. So very good question.
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:18.88 Interesting. Next question. Similar question. Yeah, this is why I grew this one together.
01:07:18.88 --> 01:07:23.68 We had a couple of grouped questions. This is one of them. Jockel, I was wondering what your advice
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:28.64 is for disagreeing up the chain of command. Obviously, this needs to be done with some
01:07:28.64 --> 01:07:33.52 tact, IE in private, not in front of others, but in those private conversations, how should one
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:39.68 respectfully disagree? Again, this again, similar question, a better technique than disagreeing,
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:43.68 it's just to ask questions. You know, boss, hey, I want to make sure I get this right. Can
01:07:43.68 --> 01:07:48.64 you explain it to me again? Can you watch me do it? Right? So your boss actually sees what the
01:07:48.64 --> 01:07:55.44 problem is. That way, you're not being offensive. Hey, boss, can you explain why you chose this
01:07:55.44 --> 01:07:59.20 course of action? I really want to learn from what you do, the way you do it.
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:09.12 I, again, does that sound like a kiss ass? Yes, because I'm exaggerating. You know what I mean? Hey,
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:13.52 boss, you're so incredibly smart. No, I'm not talking about that because bosses don't like
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:19.92 kiss ass kisses. At least good bosses. Good bosses don't. And actually, even good bosses,
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:24.32 they might keep their kiss asses around, but they don't respect them. So you don't gain influence
01:08:24.32 --> 01:08:28.72 by being a kiss ass. It's not a good situation. So I'm not talking about kissing ass, but you know,
01:08:28.72 --> 01:08:33.20 hey, boss, I'm really want to understand this and make sure I understand it. Can you, can you
01:08:33.20 --> 01:08:38.40 explain to me why this is the best way to make this to do this versus the other way? You know,
01:08:38.40 --> 01:08:41.76 that's the kind of question. That's not kiss ass. That's actually, you know, it is actually
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:46.48 legitimately wanting to know. Well, like I legitimately want to know, maybe, you know, what if we
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:49.68 instead of assuming that we know better than our boss? What if we assume that my boss knows better
01:08:49.68 --> 01:08:53.04 than me? Let's make that assumption. And if you communicate with that assumption,
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:56.88 then you're probably going to communicate in a much better way than communicating with
01:08:56.88 --> 01:09:01.20 these assumption that my boss is nitty at 9 o'clock, which is not a good way to communicate.
01:09:01.20 --> 01:09:08.64 Yeah, it's funny when you know that you kind of said that about the kiss ass guy. Because that
01:09:08.64 --> 01:09:14.16 comes up a lot. I don't want to be kiss ass. And yeah, you don't. The kiss ass guy is the same thing
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:18.88 as being friend zone. You know what friends don't mean? Yeah, I do. It's the same thing. Yeah.
01:09:18.88 --> 01:09:24.40 So like the girl, right, typically it's a guy who gets friend zone, right? Because he's like
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:30.16 too nice. He's too nice. He's too whatever. He's essentially a, and you're like a brother to
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:33.92 me intimate. Yes, man. That's what he is. So of course, the girl's going to keep them around for
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:40.56 all this like good feeling superficially. I mentioned lunch. All that stuff. All those superficial stuff.
01:09:40.56 --> 01:09:46.08 He's not going to get anywhere of legitimacy with her. Actual decision making. If you translate
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:49.68 that into the, you know, working environment or whatever. Well, yeah, the boss, I mean, a certain
01:09:49.68 --> 01:09:52.56 kind of boss, just like a certain girl's going to keep a guy around for that reason.
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:58.000 Certain boss is going to be like, yeah, I'll keep her around. I feel a little bit bad even firing
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.92 the guy like that a little bit because he's just so nice to me and gives me all these compliments.
01:10:01.92 --> 01:10:06.40 And even in a, you know, weird way, I think the kid's asked guy kind of knows that too. You know,
01:10:06.40 --> 01:10:10.32 like, how why would he ever fire me even though he's not that good in the job or whatever, right?
01:10:11.36 --> 01:10:15.52 Because, you know, he can't fire me. I'm just too nice to me. You know, there's that feeling is floating
01:10:15.52 --> 01:10:20.40 around is what I'm saying. But it's the same deal, right? Like, it's too many compliments. Just too much of a
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:27.28 yes, man. I'll keep you around for very superficial reasons. But that's it, brother. You, you don't get past.
01:10:27.92 --> 01:10:31.68 Yeah, that's, and that's not a good place to be in. No, it's not, sir.
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:37.68 That's why I'm not saying, kiss ass. And the way I just explained that of actually assuming that your
01:10:37.68 --> 01:10:43.12 boss knows more than you is a good way to approach the situation. As opposed to approaching the
01:10:43.12 --> 01:10:50.000 situation like you know more than your boss. Why act like that? The outcome isn't going to be inferior.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.28 The outcome is inferior. The outcome of acting like your boss or assuming that your boss knows
01:10:55.28 --> 01:11:00.88 more than you. The outcome is you treat them with respect. Because the other way you could try and
01:11:00.88 --> 01:11:05.60 treat them with respect, respect, but inadvertently you sound like, you know, some people, I just
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:14.40 we talk about normal face, right? Some people, they cannot even ask a question in a respectful way,
01:11:14.40 --> 01:11:20.32 right? They can't even, what was I saying over here? They can't even say, you know, hey boss,
01:11:20.32 --> 01:11:24.56 can you explain this to me? Because I really want to understand. They can't even say that, you know?
01:11:24.56 --> 01:11:30.48 Hey boss, can you explain this to me? Because it doesn't make any sense. They can't even ask a
01:11:30.48 --> 01:11:37.76 question in a respectful way. That's a skill you should master as a leader and as a follower,
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:43.12 as a leader and as a follower, how to ask questions in respectful way. Lave pointed this out.
01:11:43.12 --> 01:11:50.08 Lave pointed out. We were talking about the fact of, I would say, with a story he's told a bunch
01:11:50.08 --> 01:11:55.12 of times of going through the kill house and he's in the back of the train and you shouldn't
01:11:55.12 --> 01:11:57.92 be in the back of the train. You should be somewhere where you can lead everyone because when
01:11:57.92 --> 01:12:00.000 you're in the back of the train, you don't know what's happened in the front of the train.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.56 Of a soldier's a big group of people moving through a kill house. And I didn't, and he was, you know,
01:12:04.56 --> 01:12:09.28 Jarko didn't say, hey, stop doing that and do it this other way. He's like, he asked me questions,
01:12:09.28 --> 01:12:14.32 and he's like, they were real questions. I wasn't like, hey, they've wanted to hell or you're in the
01:12:14.32 --> 01:12:18.64 back of the train. Is that a respectful question? No, it's not a respectful question. But it's like,
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:23.92 hey, Lave, what are you doing in the back of the train? This is a respectful question. I'm actually
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:28.40 assuming that maybe Lave who doesn't have the experience that I have, who's my subordinate,
01:12:28.40 --> 01:12:33.04 as a platoon commander to me, that big task in the commander, my assumption is not that I know
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:36.64 more than him. My assumption is that he's got a reason for that. My assumption is that he knows
01:12:36.64 --> 01:12:43.12 more than me. Which is one of the one of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life. It's like, uh, I think
01:12:43.12 --> 01:12:47.52 it's assumed the person that you're talking to knows more than you. What I'm saying is the same thing.
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:53.68 Up and down the chain of command, you assume that your boss or your subordinate knows something
01:12:53.68 --> 01:12:58.96 that you don't know. And if you can ask questions in that way, instead of asking questions,
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:04.40 boss, what are we doing this for? Or Lave, why are you doing that? Lave, why are you in the back of
01:13:04.40 --> 01:13:09.04 the train? That's stupid. No. It's okay, Lave. Why are you in the back of the train? What is
01:13:09.04 --> 01:13:14.88 your purpose of being back there? I genuinely genuinely want to know. And this isn't like,
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:19.44 I'm not even saying I'm acting like that. I truly genuinely want to know what the deal is.
01:13:20.72 --> 01:13:27.36 So make the assumption up and down the chain of command that your boss, your subordinate,
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:34.40 knows more than you. And then ask good questions with true genuine curiosity that you want to
01:13:34.40 --> 01:13:44.16 know the answers to. It's a good way to go about it. Like, okay. Next question. I'm a young
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:50.48 warehouse manager that takes ownership for anything and everything that goes wrong. This seems
01:13:50.48 --> 01:14:00.56 to offend my coworkers. How can I fix it? Okay, classic dichotomy leadership question right there.
01:14:01.60 --> 01:14:07.12 You've gone too far. That's what's happened. You've gone too far. So what you have to be,
01:14:07.12 --> 01:14:13.92 do what you have to do is don't be offensive when you take ownership. When you take ownership,
01:14:13.92 --> 01:14:22.80 some people get offended by that. So when you say, hey, you know what this is mine? I got this.
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:30.16 That bothers some people. When you say, you know what, this is my fault. I'm going to fix it.
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:36.40 That even that offend some people. What the tone? Just the tone. I'm like, no, this is my fault.
01:14:36.40 --> 01:14:41.12 I got this. And you do that three times, four times, five times, and all of a sudden, because
01:14:41.12 --> 01:14:45.44 of what everything's his fault. No, he's got to fix everything. They he doesn't think I can fix it.
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:52.16 Right. You can offend people with it with all kinds of stuff. You have to work very hard to offend people.
01:14:52.72 --> 01:14:57.12 I mean, there's people get offended when you say something nice to them. You know what I mean?
01:14:57.12 --> 01:15:06.16 Yes. You know what I mean? I was watching. I met the person that yoga dude that does like
01:15:06.16 --> 01:15:13.52 yoga videos. He's got red hairs named spears. Yeah. I met him. He's randomly getting off a plane.
01:15:14.24 --> 01:15:20.32 But he's he what I. Spears or seers. Seers. I think it's seers. Maybe what I say spears?
01:15:20.32 --> 01:15:26.96 Yeah. I don't know. I know the guy though. Yeah. Yeah. He's a spiritual AF one. Yeah. Yeah. Very funny guy.
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:32.32 Very cool guy. And I was once I met him. I was a laugh and I was checking out a couple of videos,
01:15:32.32 --> 01:15:38.40 but one of them was you know how to be offended at all things. And it's hilarious. Because
01:15:39.12 --> 01:15:44.88 that's exactly what people, people with some people can get offended by anything. Yeah. So
01:15:46.48 --> 01:15:49.76 that's what you got to watch out for. Even when you're taking ownership,
01:15:50.40 --> 01:15:57.28 people can actually be offended by that if you go too far. So instead of overtly stepping up and taking
01:15:57.28 --> 01:16:02.16 ownership in this particular case, then you can tell what what's going on here. My brother here,
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:07.76 young warehouse manager, he's fired up. He wants to make things happen. He wants to get after it.
01:16:07.76 --> 01:16:11.76 And so what does he do? He's like, oh, I read extreme ownership. I'm going to take ownership of
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:16.08 everything. And that's a great attitude to have, except for you can offend people when you go too far.
01:16:16.08 --> 01:16:19.52 Because you got to read the second book that I got to do in the kitchen so that you can
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:23.92 balance out out a little bit. So instead of saying like, hey, this is mine. I'm going to take
01:16:23.92 --> 01:16:29.44 ownership of this and make it happen. Instead, you know, you look and say, hey, you know what,
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:34.08 do you want me to take care of this? Hey, you know what? That's probably in my department.
01:16:34.08 --> 01:16:39.76 You want me to take care of that? So that way, it would or like, hey, it seems like this should be
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:45.52 something I should take care of. You want me to handle that. Instead of me, me, me, me. I got to
01:16:45.52 --> 01:16:52.16 ask the question the other day at a Q&A. And the question started off with the person started the
01:16:52.16 --> 01:16:58.16 question with, I've got the vote. I've got the question that everyone in here needs answered.
01:16:59.20 --> 01:17:04.48 So so out of the gate, I was like, okay, so we have a situation here, right? Because that immediately
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:09.68 tells you that in that person's head, they've got they've got the question that everyone needs answered.
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:15.60 So there's already an ego scenario happening, like out of the gate. So
01:17:17.28 --> 01:17:20.72 same thing here, you don't know if you're going to touch someone's egos, right? So when you say,
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:25.44 look, this is my deal. And I'm going to fix it. Like some people will take a fence that. So again,
01:17:25.44 --> 01:17:31.52 you soften those a little bit, try and give credit up the chain of command, right? Try and give
01:17:31.52 --> 01:17:36.32 credit down the chain of command. Instead of all take ownership of it, it's like, hey, we got what
01:17:36.32 --> 01:17:42.48 if you say we, when when credit gets dulled out, get past that credit on, pass it to your peers,
01:17:42.48 --> 01:17:49.20 pass it to your some more than it's past it to your boss. So that's it, take ownership,
01:17:49.20 --> 01:17:53.76 what you need to do at this point, young man, is take ownership of being offensive.
01:17:54.80 --> 01:17:59.44 And when you do that, you're going to be less offensive, you're going to be more covert.
01:18:00.24 --> 01:18:04.08 Hey, guess what? Remember I said earlier, like, you don't get to pick the boss, you,
01:18:05.20 --> 01:18:09.92 you don't get to pick your boss. You, but you get to pick the relationship you have. You don't get
01:18:09.92 --> 01:18:13.20 to pick your, your peers. You don't get to pick your support as you get your team.
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:18.96 Hey, can you pick them? Yes, you can quit your job. Can you hire the right people? Yes,
01:18:18.96 --> 01:18:24.16 you can. But look, what you got is what you got. You got to work with it. You do, everyone,
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:29.52 I wish everyone is more fired up like I am. But that's not going to go well. You know,
01:18:29.52 --> 01:18:34.48 it's great that you wish that that's not going to go well. What you have to do is you got to,
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:40.56 you got to, you got to, here's another one, this is similar, right?
01:18:40.56 --> 01:18:42.56 Millennials.
01:18:45.28 --> 01:18:48.48 Well, hey, one of the things, what do they, this is a very simple, you know, I've, I've
01:18:48.48 --> 01:18:52.88 done the Millennium Quest a thousand times. And, you know, the Vietnam veterans, the Vietnam
01:18:52.88 --> 01:18:57.36 drafties compared to the, like, hey, we can talk about that again, we don't need to. But if you've
01:18:57.36 --> 01:19:03.84 got to, if you're a charge of Millennials, and you think to yourself, Millennials, thinks
01:19:03.84 --> 01:19:08.64 everything, they think everything centers around them. What do you do as a leader? You know,
01:19:08.64 --> 01:19:12.16 what I do is a leader, I make everything center around them, and then they perform, and then they
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:16.08 get after it. And as they grow up, they learn that everything doesn't center around them. But I bring
01:19:16.08 --> 01:19:20.80 them there. Why? Because I form a relationship. Why? Because I listen to them. Why? Because I understand them.
01:19:23.20 --> 01:19:28.000 So you don't get the team that you want. You don't get the boss that you want. What you do is you play
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.80 the game up and down the chain of command and form relationships up and down the chain of command.
01:19:32.80 --> 01:19:37.92 That you want. What relationships do you want? From up the chain of command, you want them to
01:19:37.92 --> 01:19:40.96 listen to you. You want them to give you what you need. You want them to get out of your way.
01:19:41.76 --> 01:19:46.32 And let you do the mission. What about down the chain of command? You want them to support what's
01:19:46.32 --> 01:19:51.12 happening. You want them to get after the job. You want them to step up and lead. That's what you want.
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:58.16 If you have an antagonistic relationship, because your Millennials think everything's about them,
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:01.76 well, then guess what? You're not going to be able to have any influence on them. Any real
01:20:01.76 --> 01:20:10.40 influence. You can have the imposed will on them. But the imposed will is a paper tiger, right?
01:20:10.40 --> 01:20:14.80 It's not real. It only lasts when you're there. And guess what they're doing? They're looking for
01:20:14.80 --> 01:20:23.04 another job. So take ownership of being offensive and be less offensive and more covert. And
01:20:23.04 --> 01:20:28.72 you know what? Bro, young warehouse manager, keep getting after it. And it will pay off. And the
01:20:28.72 --> 01:20:34.16 fact that you're fired up and you're crushing it, crush it with a little bit more tact.
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:38.96 And you're going to one day you're going to be making it happen. Yeah. We'll get time for
01:20:40.24 --> 01:20:46.000 one more question. Yeah. To add though a little tip, I think that I think you taught this to
01:20:46.56 --> 01:20:52.16 actually I realized this when I embraced extreme ownership. You can't say, hey, I'm going to take
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:56.56 extreme ownership of this. Like it's one of those things. It's like just like taking the high ground,
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:01.36 right? You get in like a thing with somebody. Yeah. You can't say, I'm going to take the high ground.
01:21:01.36 --> 01:21:05.44 And then it doesn't work like that. Like it, it just came up the high ground when you announced
01:21:05.44 --> 01:21:08.80 that you were taking the high ground. Give it up. Exactly. Same thing with extreme ownership.
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:12.16 Like in this situation. So if you're a very good point at going to the top. And the thing is
01:21:12.16 --> 01:21:16.16 I get it man. When you're like, you know, I'm taking it and he even said I take ownership of anything
01:21:16.16 --> 01:21:20.88 and everything. That goes wrong. Anything like straight up because you're guy. Right. So it might
01:21:20.88 --> 01:21:25.52 indicate, I'm not saying he's doing this, but he could be going, hey guys, no worries. I'm taking
01:21:25.52 --> 01:21:29.28 extreme ownership of this situation. You know, like if you say that kind of stuff, yeah, I could see
01:21:29.28 --> 01:21:34.96 that would rub somebody. What's odd? And this is a very good thing to understand about human nature.
01:21:36.24 --> 01:21:41.12 Everyone's jealous of you. Everyone's jealous of each other. Everyone's jealous of everyone else.
01:21:41.12 --> 01:21:49.12 No one wants you to win. Right. It's just like so when this guy is stepping up, the crowd starts to
01:21:49.12 --> 01:21:52.56 pick at him. They start to pick at him and they want to pick him. They want to pull him apart.
01:21:52.56 --> 01:21:58.48 That's generally what the crowd wants to do to you. When you step up, when you elevate yourself,
01:21:58.48 --> 01:22:05.04 generally, the crowd wants to pick it to your pull you down. You think he exactly exactly. So if you're
01:22:05.04 --> 01:22:12.40 aware of that, then you can combat it by when instead of elevating yourself in an overt manner,
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:16.96 wherever you can see you saying, I'm going to take ownership this right now and get it soft.
01:22:16.96 --> 01:22:21.84 No. Usually if I can say, hey, you know what? This is probably my fault. Do you want me to
01:22:21.84 --> 01:22:26.16 let me try and take some time and get it fixed? Everyone goes, they're actually kind of happy. They're like,
01:22:26.16 --> 01:22:31.76 yeah, it was your fault. They kind of like, it's okay with them. Whereas opposed to,
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:35.92 I'm going to take ownership. This is dichotomy leadership. You're red, extreme ownership.
01:22:35.92 --> 01:22:38.88 Awesome. You got to read dichotomy too.
01:22:41.52 --> 01:22:46.32 That's shit. It's a question. When something goes wrong, I freeze up,
01:22:46.32 --> 01:22:52.72 opposite of the, you know, I freeze up. I get stagnant. I don't want to move. I just ask myself,
01:22:52.72 --> 01:22:59.84 why me? I've tried saying good, but it's not getting me moving forward in your advice.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:14.88 You ask yourself, why me? So, saying good, that should fix your attitude.
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:26.16 But that alone, that alone will not fix your problems. If you're having problems, sure,
01:23:27.60 --> 01:23:34.88 say good, that's perfect. But then don't ask yourself, why me?
01:23:37.44 --> 01:23:41.28 Instead, ask yourself, now what am I going to do about it?
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:45.92 What are you going to do about? Ask yourself that question.
01:23:48.40 --> 01:23:55.28 And then figure it out. Figure out what you're going to do. Say to yourself,
01:23:55.28 --> 01:24:02.40 I am going to detach. I am going to assess the situation. I am going to come up with a plan,
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:16.32 and I am going to execute. And then start moving. It's not going to be a perfect plan,
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:24.40 but take action, action that moves you in a positive direction. And if it ends up being the wrong
01:24:24.40 --> 01:24:35.84 direction, that's fine. At least you've learned where not to go. Now, where this gets tough,
01:24:37.44 --> 01:24:44.16 is if it is something that seems like it's completely out of your control.
01:24:45.36 --> 01:24:50.32 And you know what, some things are completely out of your control, and that's fine.
01:24:50.32 --> 01:24:58.32 And when that happens, you ask yourself, what can I control?
01:25:00.64 --> 01:25:06.16 What can I control? That will make this situation a little bit better.
01:25:06.16 --> 01:25:17.68 And then you go. Don't get crushed by things going wrong.
01:25:20.32 --> 01:25:27.76 Ask yourself, what am I going to do and then go do it?
01:25:27.76 --> 01:25:38.96 And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo Charles speaking of
01:25:40.72 --> 01:25:47.12 moving in the right direction. I know you've got some things that can help us move in the right direction.
01:25:47.12 --> 01:25:51.76 What do you got for us? Yeah. Okay. So, that's it. That's what I'm going to do. So,
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:58.40 so the path has what many directions, but it's all in the same general direction. It's improvement.
01:25:59.68 --> 01:26:05.12 It's improvement. There's different roads on the path. Yes. Which is a really weird thing to say.
01:26:05.12 --> 01:26:09.60 Yeah. It's more of a general thing. Anyway, but you just do the universal in my opinion. I'm assuming
01:26:09.60 --> 01:26:14.16 in your opinion too. Where if you're not doing you just do more so than I would say,
01:26:14.16 --> 01:26:21.60 like that's terrible. I'm not going to say that. But I'm saying if you go through life and not
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:28.56 do jujitsu and you're on the path, you might be left maybe missing out. You know what's really cool
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:34.40 about this podcast and about people listening this podcast and about people starting jujitsu.
01:26:34.40 --> 01:26:39.68 This is the coolest thing. Two years ago, I would've been like, hey, you know, you should try
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:48.64 jujitsu. It's really good. But I couldn't like confirm how universal so many people, I just,
01:26:48.64 --> 01:26:52.64 so many people have to take their first class or the first nine classes or the first three classes.
01:26:52.64 --> 01:26:57.44 They're like, I'm addicted. Yeah. Why is that? Because there's something special about
01:26:57.44 --> 01:27:02.64 jujitsu. So, you should train it. Yeah. Yeah. When you can draw them, the parallels, the meta.
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:06.48 It's the metaphor for like, the 18 list to tell me that early on actually.
01:27:06.48 --> 01:27:11.76 You know, actually, the master philosopher. They did a class for and under govow. It'll
01:27:11.76 --> 01:27:16.000 straight at some point. And a big one that under govow said that I will never forget. It's like,
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.96 jujitsu is like, is life. So, consider jujitsu. Like, if you turn your back on your problems,
01:27:20.96 --> 01:27:24.64 in jujitsu, they're going to get worse. And let's face it. That's in, especially early on. That's how
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:28.000 you get a guy to turn. That's how you get a choke. Right. When you're mounted on somebody,
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.76 you slap him in the face. Why? And why? If you get slapped in the face, what do you want to do?
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:34.96 Turn your back. Right? They call it don't slap my face. That's how you get the choke.
01:27:34.96 --> 01:27:40.48 So, under govow said, and jujitsu, you turn your back. And you give your back to your opponent.
01:27:41.04 --> 01:27:45.44 That's the worst thing you can do. But it's hard to face them usually. You got to work, you know?
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.44 Same thing in life, man. Turn your back on your problems. Those problems are going to get you.
01:27:49.44 --> 01:27:54.24 Yeah. Then you've heard me say that at the master. You turn your back on your problems. They don't
01:27:54.24 --> 01:27:58.08 go away. They actually get worse. And it's the same exact thing in jujitsu.
01:27:58.08 --> 01:28:04.80 I'm not joking. Yes. Getting particularly angry. So it's cool now to get feedback from thousands of
01:28:04.80 --> 01:28:12.56 people that have now gotten in the jujitsu game and the feedback, I've got probably, I think,
01:28:12.56 --> 01:28:18.72 three people out of many, many. And this isn't one of yours where you say like a lot of people
01:28:18.72 --> 01:28:24.72 and it's like four. I'm talking thousands of people. I've gotten three that don't like jujitsu.
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:29.68 That did, they just don't like it. And that's why I came up with the rule. Okay, if you don't like it,
01:28:29.68 --> 01:28:34.24 that's fine. Train at least until you've submitted someone that's kind of equivalent.
01:28:34.88 --> 01:28:39.52 And then you can stop. Yeah. And the reason I think, I think that's actually once you do that,
01:28:39.52 --> 01:28:42.72 you'll you'll understand jujitsu because I'm going to just don't even understand it.
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:46.64 Sometimes people just can't comprehend it. They can't comprehend what's happening.
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:52.24 And it's just too much. Yeah. This is too much. Yeah. And so they don't want to do it.
01:28:52.24 --> 01:28:57.52 Yeah. But if you do it long enough that you submit someone, then you get that little like,
01:28:57.52 --> 01:29:03.76 wow, the fucker. It's incredible like at the master when you when you show the connection of
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:09.76 two moves. Yeah. This like, it's like amazing. Oh yeah. And then when you try and explain that every
01:29:09.76 --> 01:29:17.28 move is connected that way. Because that's a big, so it's a big network. But but people don't
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:24.48 understand that jujitsu is not just moves. Yeah. That it's all this grouped thing together.
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:31.20 This symphony of movement. Leng which is good. Anyway, when you do it,
01:29:31.20 --> 01:29:35.28 you're going to need a key because you're going to do key and no key. So key and rash card. That's
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:40.08 the uniform. Call it a uniform. Sure. So you go to origin because you're going to get an origin
01:29:40.08 --> 01:29:47.04 key. It's the best one. Origin main dot com or it just means we forgive to say that. We're not good. I
01:29:47.04 --> 01:29:54.08 feel like I forget to say that the name is origin. I say origin mean. Okay. So cool. But you'll,
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:59.44 yeah, you'll come to realize that it's very obvious that origin is the only kind of key that you'll
01:29:59.44 --> 01:30:04.64 want slash need. I mean America, by the way, the threads are me. I like to throw that out there.
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:08.40 Just like, oh, by the way, like it's made America. No, it's not just something you throw out there.
01:30:08.40 --> 01:30:17.68 It's a big deal. We're talking about a loom multiple times. I actually had this. So I was talking
01:30:17.68 --> 01:30:22.40 to, is actually my literary agent. Sure. And I was like, well, you know, like, I said it turns out,
01:30:23.68 --> 01:30:28.000 you know, they're not, they can't put out Mikey in the dragons before November. So I'm just going
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.48 to, you know, make this book myself and starting a publishing company. And she's like, um,
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:38.40 well, you know, a lot of people try that. But you know, it's, there's a lot more to it. You know,
01:30:38.40 --> 01:30:44.72 it's really hard. Yeah. And I was like, okay. Cool. Do you know what a loom is? I go, my friends
01:30:44.72 --> 01:30:53.92 up and main brought a loom back from the grave and weave material from cotton and nylon to sew together.
01:30:53.92 --> 01:30:59.84 The loom weighs 9,000 pounds. The loom weighs 9,000 pounds. There has 5 million threads in going into it.
01:30:59.84 --> 01:31:05.28 It's got, it's got millions of parts inside of it. It was rusted. You're going to tell me we can't
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:11.12 get photocopy some stuff and put it out in the book. I got this. I got this. Don't, don't, don't,
01:31:11.12 --> 01:31:16.80 and it's funny because I told that to Brian and Pete. I was laughing so hard because, because really,
01:31:16.80 --> 01:31:21.92 what's what I, I don't even know if I could think of something harger. Then saying, oh, we're going
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:29.36 to drag a loom out of a dam, abandoned factory in Lewiston, Maine. Yeah. One loom left. The rest of
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:34.80 them have been sent overseas during the economic downturn. Oh, we'll just, we'll just, we'll just outsource.
01:31:34.80 --> 01:31:39.68 Now I remind outsource, we're just going to send our bread and butter, our American hardware
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:45.60 overseas and let someone else make it. There was one loom left. And guess what? We got it.
01:31:45.60 --> 01:31:52.32 Orgen. Yeah. So you're telling me that we can take this old loom that's 30 years old that
01:31:52.32 --> 01:31:58.24 hasn't been run. That's rusted and dirty and abandoned and bring that thing back to life.
01:31:58.24 --> 01:32:03.04 You're telling me we can't print some books and get him out to my people. You're wrong.
01:32:03.04 --> 01:32:11.04 Watch me. Straight up wrong. Get some jockel publish. Yep. And that loom does not only make
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:15.92 geese in rashcards by the way. Multiple looms by the way. It wasn't just that one loom. No, it was
01:32:15.92 --> 01:32:21.36 one loom. Oh, it turns in with yes. And now there's three looms. Rocking in roll. Yeah. Yeah. So,
01:32:21.36 --> 01:32:29.84 yeah, you can get shirts and joggers and sweats. Sweats. Uh, uh, named. Named. I don't know about
01:32:29.84 --> 01:32:34.48 name. We'll say named the most comfortable sweat and sweats in the world. Straight up. The joggers. I
01:32:34.48 --> 01:32:40.16 proclaim straight up most comfortable pants in the world. Then the less. Find out for yourself.
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:45.44 Anyway, orgen made.com to make a lot of cool good stuff all made in America by the way. Yeah. And
01:32:45.44 --> 01:32:50.56 that includes made in America supplements. Jockel, stop. Jockel, stop. Jockel, stop.
01:32:50.56 --> 01:32:58.64 But, you know, the jocco thing is just to complete a lack of originality. That's what it is.
01:32:58.64 --> 01:33:03.44 Get. Because when you think about it from a broader perspective and you know me well enough to be like,
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:10.08 the last thing I would do is like, oh, I'm just going to call everything jocco. It's like,
01:33:10.08 --> 01:33:15.12 bizarre, although. Yeah. Well, and it started with a podcast. It started with jockel podcast. And
01:33:15.12 --> 01:33:20.88 that after I've said this before, but I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast and he was, he said, like,
01:33:20.88 --> 01:33:27.44 are you hungry? And I was like, jockel hungry. And for some reason that just made me jockel. And then
01:33:27.44 --> 01:33:31.52 when we were naming this podcast, I was like, oh, you're like, what do you call him like,
01:33:31.52 --> 01:33:37.12 jockel podcast? As if it's the same nanderfall thing. And so then then it was like, okay,
01:33:37.12 --> 01:33:41.12 we're going to make tea. What do you call, Paul McGrann at white tea? What do we call it? Like,
01:33:41.12 --> 01:33:45.20 the Vedic solution? I mean, what are you going to call it? Like, it's like, okay, well,
01:33:45.20 --> 01:33:49.60 just it's going to be the tea that I drink. So it's called jocco white tea. Okay, cool. Well, then
01:33:50.32 --> 01:33:56.72 hey, when I when I started saying, you know what, I need to make some good supplements,
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:02.24 Pete and Brian in the game. Like, I'm like, hey, go, and you make this. And they're like,
01:34:02.24 --> 01:34:06.32 yeah, and I said, okay, well, then what are we going to call it? Well, just call it, you know,
01:34:06.32 --> 01:34:14.08 jockel super cool. Then there you go. So that's how we end up with the least creative name of any
01:34:14.08 --> 01:34:19.84 products they've existed. I apologize to everyone. Actually, it seemed like well early on anyway,
01:34:19.84 --> 01:34:23.76 it seemed like it wasn't creative because you're like, hey, this create like, if I create this
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:30.32 super creative name, like, is that important? Really great. Now I'm too busy making it good. Well,
01:34:30.32 --> 01:34:35.76 we talked about in the last podcast that sometimes I'm so in the functionality. Yeah, that's
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:42.56 it. That I'm not in in synchronicity with the rest of the world sometimes. For instance,
01:34:42.56 --> 01:34:49.28 if you allowed me to design a house, no human being would live in the house except for me and like
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:53.12 three other seals that I know that would be like, oh, it's house is perfect. I've never
01:34:53.12 --> 01:34:57.84 know to be like, bro, what is wrong with you? And so you, you know, you have to keep that.
01:34:57.84 --> 01:35:01.84 Same with vehicles. Like, if I could design my own vehicle, no one would want to drive it, but me.
01:35:01.84 --> 01:35:05.52 Maybe that's what I want to make. They look a little bit broader because you get people that'd be like,
01:35:05.52 --> 01:35:14.000 yeah, oh, so I have to be careful because sometimes I'm just so into function that it just doesn't
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.12 make sense to anyone else but me. Yeah, but it does have its value big time when it comes to
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:24.32 supplements because what joint warfare function. Try lose function or you're joint see what happens.
01:35:24.32 --> 01:35:29.20 Same thing with cruel oils, same thing with discipline, brain function. And then of course,
01:35:29.20 --> 01:35:35.52 that's muscle function muscle building function recovery. Yeah. It does look all of them together.
01:35:35.52 --> 01:35:43.52 Brain function joint function muscle function. Boom, you're good to go. Yeah. Yeah. And speaking of
01:35:43.52 --> 01:35:51.04 functionality and this is one of the things where you to kind of attack me. You attacked me because
01:35:51.68 --> 01:35:57.20 for you in, see, this is this is a perfect example. In your mind, I'm all about function, right?
01:35:57.20 --> 01:36:03.28 Yes. Then when I started making supplements, I wanted them to taste good. Yes. And that was actually,
01:36:04.40 --> 01:36:09.84 it was actually side by side with functionality. His taste. Why is that? Because if you
01:36:09.84 --> 01:36:13.12 don't, if it doesn't taste good, then it's not going to function because you're not going to use it.
01:36:14.32 --> 01:36:21.60 So these taste delish, especially, more, let's face the facts. There's this, it's this whole new thing.
01:36:21.60 --> 01:36:26.72 Yeah. It's a, it's literally a new thing in the world. We had to create, I created a name for it.
01:36:27.60 --> 01:36:31.92 Mulk, why did I create that name? What else you're going to call it? It doesn't make sense to call it anything else.
01:36:31.92 --> 01:36:35.12 Because it's not anything else. It just is mulk. That's what it is.
01:36:36.56 --> 01:36:43.76 Now, okay. I got four kids. We know I have four kids. I spend time with kids. I see kids all the time.
01:36:43.76 --> 01:36:48.56 We got kids to just programs at my gym. What do kids need kids need fuel? What do kids get fed?
01:36:48.56 --> 01:36:54.16 They get fed crap. Why? Because there's, there's sugar in everything. There's high-fruits,
01:36:54.16 --> 01:36:58.40 those currents were, corn syrup and everything. There's, it's just garbage.
01:36:59.60 --> 01:37:04.64 So, with my own kids, what do I want to feed them? I want to feed them something that's good.
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:11.76 We made warrior kid mulk. Why? Because kids need good foodie. We're putting kids on the warrior path.
01:37:11.76 --> 01:37:18.16 I get letters every single day from kids all over the world, New Zealand, Australia.
01:37:18.16 --> 01:37:23.76 Europe, America, for sure. Kids that are seven years old, that are nine years old, that are 11
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:28.40 years old, that are 14 years old, and they're on the path. They're doing pull-ups. They're doing
01:37:28.40 --> 01:37:32.16 jujitsu. They're sending pictures of their jujitsu tournament. They're drawing pictures of
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:37.76 their metal that they got for jujitsu. There's kids that are on the warrior kid path. What are they eating?
01:37:38.96 --> 01:37:42.56 Are they eating junk? Sometimes they're eating junk, not because they want to, but that's because
01:37:42.56 --> 01:37:50.72 that's what's in their fridge. So, had to solve that problem. So, we made warrior kid mulk. Again,
01:37:50.72 --> 01:37:56.08 what was equivalent to functionality? The function was they need protein, they need vitamins,
01:37:56.08 --> 01:38:03.76 they need probiotics. Functional. Part side-by-side with that had to taste good. Had to taste good.
01:38:04.56 --> 01:38:07.92 And what do we end up with? Warrior kid mulk, chocolate and strawberry.
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:18.96 It's freaking delicious. Both of them. They're so good. They're so tasty. It's ridiculous.
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:27.92 So, that's warrior kid mulk. That's available from originmain.com. We're going to try and get
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:34.08 that one out to the masses. Every kid needs warrior kid mulk. Instead of drinking some sugarful
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:40.08 crap of fillers. We're going to give you real food. Gonna make you stronger. We're so good.
01:38:40.08 --> 01:38:44.96 Yeah man. We can't have had soda growing up in my house, but I used to go to my friend's house
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:50.88 and he was Eric Masters. He's a pilot from the first by the way. So, I'd go to his house and
01:38:50.88 --> 01:38:54.24 they'd have, so he didn't. He wasn't pounding. So, what other time is it superior athlete? Oh,
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.16 this is the sky. But they had soda kind of above the thing. Wait, so when I was a kid,
01:38:58.16 --> 01:39:02.16 we didn't even relate. Like, soda wasn't bad for you. We just were like, oh, this is just,
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:05.52 this is just how? Like, oh, we just directly, I'm thirsty. I'm going to drink a coke.
01:39:05.52 --> 01:39:10.08 Yeah. And the answer to your phrase, but that like when you're a kid, like, oh, I haven't
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:14.64 drinking anything all day. I'm really thirsty. Give me a coke. Yeah. You just drink it. Exactly.
01:39:14.64 --> 01:39:18.64 Right. And that's the point. You don't know that there was 36 grams of corn syrup in there.
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:23.92 Yeah. It's a, yeah. Good job. Thinking back, I'm like, dang, that is a crazy violation.
01:39:23.92 --> 01:39:28.64 Crazy. Well, could you imagine, like, an only weighed 48 pounds? Yeah.
01:39:28.64 --> 01:39:33.36 It wasn't like it wasn't like you're a 225 pound grown man. Like I am right now.
01:39:33.36 --> 01:39:38.32 I can probably put down a coke in a wooden, but you're, you're nine years old.
01:39:38.32 --> 01:39:44.64 Look, here it. Get some of that wrong. Some grape crush. Yeah. Pineapple. So,
01:39:44.64 --> 01:39:48.64 anywhere's a cut you know, in a, in a, in a, in a, a master's. No. Yeah. But no, that was, that,
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:52.64 that's the point where you go in. It's just, so that's just how, oh, yeah, grab a soda after
01:39:52.64 --> 01:39:57.12 school, whatever. They'd sell soda for 50 cents after our school. You go in the thing, you buy the soda,
01:39:57.12 --> 01:40:02.32 whatever, soda machine, whatever. What if he was milked, though? Oh, way better. Way better.
01:40:02.32 --> 01:40:05.12 Because it tastes just as good. If it actually tastes better, then it's so tough.
01:40:05.12 --> 01:40:09.84 It's like that's all for sure. Yeah. Oh, the naïvil. Yeah. And you're, yeah, that'd be just
01:40:09.84 --> 01:40:16.40 be way better. So, there you go. Warrior kid milk, but milk for the adults. And then the other
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:20.40 funny thing was I had all the people send in pictures of their kids drinking. Before we had Warrior
01:40:20.40 --> 01:40:23.60 Kid Mokers, the kids were just straight up going down the Mokers, trained themselves.
01:40:23.60 --> 01:40:28.88 Little kids, two years old, three years old, four years old, little kids drinking Mok.
01:40:28.88 --> 01:40:37.28 Oh, I got the Warrior Kid Mok. Little less protein. Tasty as can be vitamins, probiotics,
01:40:38.32 --> 01:40:43.44 just good to go. Go away to go. 100%. Yeah, totally good to go. You're going to change the world

01:42:12.80 --> 01:42:18.40 kid podcast on repeat for his kids. I talked to so many people when we got roll call,
01:42:18.40 --> 01:42:24.24 mustard. They're like, yeah, we're going. We just got it 24, 7 kids in the car. We're listening to
01:42:24.24 --> 01:42:29.52 warrior kid podcast. The lessons that you want to teach your kid that your kid doesn't really want
01:42:29.52 --> 01:42:33.76 to hear from you because you're their mom. You're their dad. They don't want to hear it from you.
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:38.64 They want to hear it from Uncle Jake. They want to hear it from Uncle Jake. And I'd go so far as to say,
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:45.44 don't even, you know, you said you can't just say, I'm going to take extreme ownership of that. What
01:42:45.44 --> 01:42:49.20 you can't do with your kids is turn around when you're in the car and say, you see Uncle Jake
01:42:49.20 --> 01:42:54.40 seeing the same thing I told you. Yeah, don't do that. Don't don't don't discredit Uncle Jake.
01:42:55.76 --> 01:42:58.48 And you're not really discrediting him. But what you're doing is
01:42:58.48 --> 01:43:05.60 you're bringing your, you're forming a team, right? You're forming a team. It's us against you.
01:43:05.60 --> 01:43:10.80 And when Uncle Jake's talking to kid down the same team, yeah, Uncle Jake is in the game with the
01:43:10.80 --> 01:43:18.72 kids, the kids, you have a natural friction with your parents. If you take Uncle Jake's side
01:43:18.72 --> 01:43:23.04 strongly, now you're on Uncle Jowt, you against your kids against you. You don't want that.
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:27.12 You should almost play reverse psychology. Yeah. And be like, well, you know, it's a little
01:43:27.12 --> 01:43:31.36 extreme for Uncle Jake to want to work out that much. And your kid be like, well,
01:43:32.16 --> 01:43:37.84 I think we should probably let's know Uncle Jake. Dad. Maybe maybe we should get a pull up bar.
01:43:38.40 --> 01:43:42.48 By the way, get a pull up bar for your kids. Just get a pull up bar form. You
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:48.64 doesn't cost much cost 12 bucks. You just need to piece a pipe. And you just, you just put it
01:43:48.64 --> 01:43:53.52 hang it somewhere for your kids. They can do pull ups. Pull ups are important for children. Straight
01:43:53.52 --> 01:43:59.92 up. There's some fact about no kid that can do a pull up is obese in the whole world. You can't
01:43:59.92 --> 01:44:07.12 be obese and do a pull up as a kid. So let's do some pull ups. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a good way too
01:44:07.12 --> 01:44:11.44 for the don't don't be like, I'm going to put this on and you're going to listen. Oh yeah,
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:18.56 don't do that. Like it. Yeah. You want the kids you want. It's like when you go through military boot camp,
01:44:18.56 --> 01:44:25.12 the drill instructors are real mean because they want you to form a gang against them. That's
01:44:25.12 --> 01:44:30.64 part of the psychologists. They want it to be us against them. So we form up into a pull tune and
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:35.60 we're against this guy and then the end all comes together. Same thing we're going here. We,
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:43.04 you don't you want to let Uncle Jake be part of their team. And you just, oh man, well,
01:44:43.04 --> 01:44:48.72 this stuff Uncle Jake says man, he seems like a pretty intense guy. And actually Uncle
01:44:48.72 --> 01:44:52.96 Jake isn't that intense on the warrior kid podcast. No. He's telling stories about being a kid.
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.60 He's answering questions about being a kid. Yeah. podcast is soft. I mean not softer, but like
01:44:59.60 --> 01:45:03.20 he's not is he's more intense in the book. For sure. He's more intense in the book. Yeah.

01:45:53.84 --> 01:45:57.12 recommendations or any suggestions or anything you need from psychological warfare,
01:45:57.84 --> 01:46:02.80 some moment of weakness that you have, we got a request for shopping an impulsive shopper.

01:46:14.40 --> 01:46:21.12 that happen. That's available anywhere you can buy MP3s. Yeah. Very, 100% success rate. Also,
01:46:21.12 --> 01:46:27.36 speaking of moments of weakness like if you don't want to go to the gym, get stuff,
01:46:27.36 --> 01:46:32.08 gym stuff, work out equipment for your house. This is where you get them on it.com. Get
01:46:32.08 --> 01:46:37.60 all the kettlebells, rings, battle ropes. You can get a mason of club. Do that.
01:46:38.24 --> 01:46:41.60 But you're going to good work out. Anyway, makes it way easier to stay on the path.
01:46:41.60 --> 01:46:45.76 Why it goes with face at driving to the gym is not that cool. And if you're feeling lazy
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:50.64 or your time is pressuring like time constraints, but I just stay home. Get a workout hard one
01:46:50.64 --> 01:46:56.000 too. That's where I get my hands from. You know, yeah, on it.com slash jockel. That's a spot to go
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:04.40 100%. Also, jockel white tea. That's it. I'm like almost like it was going to have some music.
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:12.72 Jockel white tea. Well, and there's a day caught in me in that too. Sure. It tastes good. We
01:47:12.72 --> 01:47:18.88 know that. It's tasting good as part of the functionality I get. But like white tea kind of sounds
01:47:18.88 --> 01:47:26.88 kind of light and like, Dane. Oh, I see something. It's like a black coffee. You know, and you
01:47:26.88 --> 01:47:32.24 could not have known that coffee. Get some power. I was telling life. I've never had a sip of coffee
01:47:32.24 --> 01:47:36.80 in my whole life. I thought you said you didn't like the taste. Okay. Well, I should have clarified
01:47:36.80 --> 01:47:43.28 that. You don't like the smell. So I didn't put it to my lips. No, really. All right, hey man, fair enough.
01:47:43.28 --> 01:47:51.60 I dig it. Jockel white tea. My wife's mom, a Brit. Sure. Like my wife's a Brit. My wife's mom is
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:56.64 even more brainstrike because this is old. Oh, yeah. She guess what she drinks because you know,
01:47:56.64 --> 01:48:00.56 you know, British people, they don't even play around with tea. They don't even play around with
01:48:00.56 --> 01:48:07.04 tea. That's part of the deal part of the life. Guess what kind of tea she drinks? Jockel white. Yeah.
01:48:07.04 --> 01:48:13.20 So I was she did that. We're sending shipments of Jockel white tea to England. So she
01:48:13.20 --> 01:48:19.84 believed the the the the the damn world global home of tea. Yeah. They're the we're having to
01:48:19.84 --> 01:48:25.28 ship it because you but your thing was always the cold the iced tea. No, I have the one tea. So you
01:48:25.28 --> 01:48:30.96 I mean, as far as like before you made Jockel white tea, you I'd always see drinking the cold one.
01:48:30.96 --> 01:48:36.72 Most most the time I prefer cold because most of the time I'm in a situation where I am
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:42.24 hot and I need to cool down. Sometimes I'm in a situation where I'm cool and I need to warm up.
01:48:42.24 --> 01:48:46.56 When I want to sell them. Yeah, when you're cold, you want to be cozy. No, you're so good.
01:48:46.56 --> 01:48:53.60 Better back off. But I'm saying Brits, they don't dig the cold iced tea. That's why.
01:48:53.60 --> 01:48:57.60 Well, you know what's nice is like before you have to talk a lot. Sure. You can drink some
01:48:57.60 --> 01:49:03.68 white tea for the throat. Just like relax the throat and yet at the same time you're getting a little
01:49:03.68 --> 01:49:12.56 caffeine hitter. Give a little caffeine hitter with some antioxidants and not to mention if there's any vehicles
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:17.76 you need to pick up. You got an 8,000 pound deadlift to be good to go guarantee. Whatever you need.
01:49:17.76 --> 01:49:22.64 Yeah, it's good. I saw the Yovon the other day and he was he posted something on Instagram. He had a
01:49:22.64 --> 01:49:30.40 chick filet hitter. So those of you that are wondering about my hitter reference. Yes,
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:35.20 Theo Vaughn thank you. You have brought that word into my vocabulary and I had a little
01:49:35.20 --> 01:49:41.52 jocquite hitter. I also have been using the term to describe one scoop of milk.
01:49:42.48 --> 01:49:48.40 It was just that's just a one is a one scoop hitter. Good. Because because two scoops legitimately
01:49:48.40 --> 01:49:52.72 fills you up, you don't want to eat a meal. Yeah. No, you don't want to. Or you you hate like a
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:57.52 little decent meal, but you still want something a dessert. Two two scoops. And you're just
01:49:57.52 --> 01:50:04.000 that's too much. Too much. You have a little one scoop hitter. Easy one. And you're good to go. Good to go.
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.44 And if you try the strawberry kids. Strawberry kids more because ridiculously tasty.
01:50:09.44 --> 01:50:12.16 Yeah, you're on to something. Yeah, check.
