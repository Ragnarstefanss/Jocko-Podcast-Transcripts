[00:00:13] Еcómours.] Margadmin 22420. subject availability of
[00:00:26] ncdp7 learning. One purpose the
[00:00:32] commanding general, training an education command
[00:00:34] as published Marine Corps documental publication
[00:00:37] 7 Learning dated 20 February 2020. Background. The common-on planning guidance released 17 July 2019
[00:00:47] establishing learning a combination of education and training as a priority focus area to develop
[00:00:53] an intellectual edge to capitalize on the unique ethos of the core and its maneuver warfare mindset.
[00:01:01] On 2020, the common-on of the Marine Corps general David H. Burger approved MCDP 7 Learning
[00:01:12] the first entirely new doctrinal publication released by the Marine Corps since 2001.
[00:01:19] MCDP 7 Learning formalizes the philosophy principles concepts and expectations of learning.
[00:01:26] MCDP 7 Learning states that the Marine Corps's learning philosophy seeks to create a culture
[00:01:34] of continuous learning and professional competence that yields adaptive leaders capable of
[00:01:39] successful, successfully conducting maneuver warfare in complex uncertain and chaotic environments.
[00:01:47] MCDP 7 Learning has been developed to codify the Marine Corps's learning philosophy and explain
[00:01:54] why learning is essential to the profession of arms. Going forward, MCDP 7 Learning will serve as a guide
[00:02:04] for a culture of continuous learning and professional competence that yields adaptive
[00:02:09] leaders who can quickly recognize changing conditions in the battle space, adapt, and make timely
[00:02:15] decisions against a thinking enemy. This publication's audience is all Marines.
[00:02:26] Coordinating instructions in an initial distribution of 11, 330 publication hard copies
[00:02:32] is underway. Units requiring additional print allocations must follow procedures identified in
[00:02:37] reference A paragraph 4A. This more admin is applicable to Marine Corps full total force.
[00:02:50] So there you go. The Marine Corps in case you didn't gather from that message has a new
[00:02:57] doctrinal publication. The first one since 2001 and there was probably not too many people that
[00:03:07] were a little bit giddy and excited about it besides myself and David R. Burke.
[00:03:14] proof. The release of this publication in its own right is proof that the Marine Corps is learning.
[00:03:21] That's a bold statement. So yeah, the Marine Corps has a new pop out.
[00:03:26] We're going to study it right now. So here we go. Marine Corps,
[00:03:32] doctional publication 7. It's called Learning. Here we go. And we'll start off with the forward
[00:03:39] Department of the Navy headquarters in its Marine Corps. The purpose of this publication is to
[00:03:44] describe the Marine Corps's learning philosophy and explain why learning is critically important
[00:03:49] to the profession of arms. While the concept, while many of the concepts in this publication
[00:03:55] have been passed on by Marine leaders throughout our history, this publication seeks to formalize
[00:04:00] them and provide aspirational goals. That's a familiar subject. Learning is an institutional
[00:04:07] priority and a professional expectation for all Marines. This mentality is key to the Marine
[00:04:15] Corps becoming a more effective learning organization. Now you're going to find as we run through
[00:04:20] this and the way they define learning and the way they talk about learning. Obviously, this does
[00:04:24] not only apply to the profession of arms and it obviously doesn't apply only to the Marine
[00:04:28] Corps and it applies to everybody in the world, every human being. Continuing on, the most
[00:04:35] important factor in this philosophy is the importance of continuous learning throughout our careers
[00:04:40] for war fighting. Continuous learning is essential to maneuver warfare because it enables
[00:04:46] Marines to quickly recognize changing conditions in the battle space, adapt and make timely
[00:04:51] decisions against a thinking enemy. These skills required in war must be learned, developed,
[00:04:58] and honed over time if neglected. They quickly atrophy. This is one of the first things that I
[00:05:04] notice is they break down this thing of when you're on the battlefield and this is so clear
[00:05:10] but when you're on the battlefield, the enemy is doing something and they're changing their tactics
[00:05:13] and we've talked about that for years what you're actually doing is you're learning what they're
[00:05:17] doing and you're learning how you need to respond to it. So the mindset of learning is that we
[00:05:23] we talk about adaptation a lot. Well, if you can't learn, you're not going to be able to adapt anything.
[00:05:31] Marines leverage the art and science of learning technologies and learning environments that
[00:05:36] reflect the changing operational environment to tailor learning and provide each other with constructive
[00:05:41] feedback. Leaders hold Marines to high professional standards of performance conduct and
[00:05:47] discipline to include learning as Marines rise in rank and position continuous learning and developing
[00:05:55] our professional skills are a professional expectation. So you are that's what it is. If you're in
[00:06:01] the Marine Corps, you're learning. That's the expectation. We must make the most of every learning
[00:06:07] opportunity fostering our subordinates learning while continuing our own. Continuous learning is
[00:06:14] important to Marines because of the fundamental nature of war and it's ever changing character.
[00:06:19] The nature of war carries a combination of fear on certainty and bigudity and bigudity,
[00:06:25] chance horror and above all friction that Marines must prepare to counter.
[00:06:32] Marines must seek out education and training opportunities that stimulate these conditions.
[00:06:37] We must train how we fight. As Marines, we must understand how important learning is and be
[00:06:44] committed to the principles laid out in this publication. Our professional responsibility as Marines
[00:06:50] is to engage in continuous learning so that we may best support our fellow Marines, our core and
[00:06:56] our nation signed the H Burger General, US Marine Corps, Comedon of the Marine Corps.
[00:07:02] That's how they kick it off and if you haven't heard Dave and I talking about any of these other
[00:07:08] any of the other Marine Corps manuals that we've covered in one of the very first things that I
[00:07:13] covered on this podcast was war fighting, which is a great publication but the Marine Corps
[00:07:19] has a way of writing publications and a way of writing. That is awesome. They nail it.
[00:07:25] Chapter one is called the nature of learning. Starts off with some quotes as a life which
[00:07:39] I really don't like. In general, I generally don't like when things start with quotes but I think
[00:07:44] the Marine Corps gets a pass here. I generally don't like when people say, even you know you'll
[00:07:49] hear someone give a speech, you know, a commencement address and they'll say in the words of
[00:07:55] so on and so and you're like, right. You know, they could have read that. If you got asked to do
[00:08:05] a graduate, a commencement speech or you got asked to give a talk, they're asking you to give that
[00:08:12] talk, right? Am I wrong? No, you're right. And look, I'm not saying that there's not times
[00:08:18] we're quote-torned. I've used them. I don't use them a lot though. I will say that. In fact, I really
[00:08:23] use them. It's going to be probably pat and or hack worth. You're shaking your hands. That's
[00:08:27] how you're going to say is it's Algrange and Mattis. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of my threshold
[00:08:32] as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're going to go with the first one. As a lifetime serial learner,
[00:08:38] I found that extraordinary people can do the extraordinary who are committed to experiential learning
[00:08:42] our intellectual ecurious and possess an unquenchable desire to acquire new knowledge. This may be
[00:08:49] our only advantage in the future fight. And that's from Lorna M. I don't know how you say that last
[00:08:54] name may lock a gas, but she's a general Marine Corps from Brooklyn, New York via Jamaica.
[00:09:04] But what I like about that is this may be our only advantage in future fight because at some point
[00:09:10] the playing feels get level. And then who it's who is smarter? It's not even who is smarter.
[00:09:16] It's who can learn faster. Yeah. Algrange, 29th Common Out of the Marine Corps,
[00:09:23] two verbal arts, Mustang, by the way, Camies, by the way, if you go and look at all the Marine
[00:09:30] Corps commonouts at all and they're dressed blue as except for one. Algrange,
[00:09:33] they're saying he's in his camis getting after it. And he says, what you did isn't as important
[00:09:42] as what you were thinking. And how many times when I was in charge of training, I watched
[00:09:52] somebody do something, watch some young junior officer do something. And I look, I saw what they did.
[00:09:58] And I'd say, you know, what were you thinking when you just did that? What was your, what was
[00:10:03] in your head? What were you trying to make happen? Like I get it, I get what you did.
[00:10:09] I'm not even concerned about that. I want to know what you were thinking. Because you might have
[00:10:11] made a bad decision. You might have made a bad tactical call, but if you had a good idea,
[00:10:16] then we can figure out how to teach you the tactics of getting it done. But if you were thinking
[00:10:21] something wrong, where we have a bit much bigger problem. And then General Mattis, the most important
[00:10:30] six inches on the battlefield is between your ears. Indeed, needs no explanation. Here we go,
[00:10:37] getting into it. Warfighting is the most complex, challenging, violent, and dynamic human
[00:10:41] in-depth. The Marine Corps, as a nation's force and readiness, must have the versatility and
[00:10:47] flexibility to effectively fight and succeed in any situation and that any intensity across the
[00:10:52] full spectrum of conflict, whenever and wherever the nation calls. If you think about what that
[00:11:00] sentence says, check it out. Must have the versatility and flexibility to effectively fight and succeed
[00:11:08] in any situation. And this is the part that I think is really stands out and at any intensity.
[00:11:14] Right? This is from hand-to-hand bloodbath combat to non-combatant evacuation.
[00:11:22] Right? This is just you got to be able to do anything in the full spectrum.
[00:11:28] Continuing to meet these demands, it is critical that Marines recognize that learning has a
[00:11:33] direct impact on warfighting. Marines who understand the key learning principles and continuously
[00:11:38] seek opportunities to develop knowledge, skills, and the proper attitudes throughout their careers
[00:11:45] will develop wisdom that enables success in battle.
[00:11:53] As Marines, we pass on our wisdom and our experiences to the next generation of Marines.
[00:11:58] For the Marine Corps to remain the United States force in readiness. It is critical that every
[00:12:05] Marines strengthen and value learning in all facets of the Marine Corps culture, learning environments,
[00:12:11] and leadership development. Learning is a professional responsibility for all Marines at all levels.
[00:12:20] Learning is a professional responsibility for all Marines at all levels.
[00:12:25] Marines must develop the habit of continuous learning early in their careers to set conditions
[00:12:31] for success in increasing levels of responsibility. Really makes it pretty clear.
[00:12:39] That's what the Marine Corps do. The Marine Corps dox. Man, they nail it.
[00:12:44] You talk about simple-clear and concise columns. Yes. They just, they got it.
[00:12:47] The clear. Man, it's right there. Hey, if we're going to win wars, we got to get smart.
[00:12:50] What I find most, or one of the most impressive things about when you read this
[00:12:55] is when you read really anything Marine Corps dox pubs. A general, a colonel, a gunny sergeant,
[00:13:09] and a landscorporer. Can all read this and go, okay, I get that. And I see it.
[00:13:17] Right? That's what they do so well. It's just, they nail it. And the way they do that is simple-clear and concise.
[00:13:27] First section, learning and competence. Learning is developing knowledge skills and
[00:13:31] attitudes through study, experience or instruction. It is a never-ending progression that includes
[00:13:37] understanding why something is important, the intent of learning. What do you think?
[00:13:51] It's like, oh, okay, cool. So everything that we talk about from a decentralized command to
[00:13:59] perspective, when you apply that on an individual level for learning, the exact same rules apply.
[00:14:06] That means it is your team has to understand why they're doing what they're doing. In this case,
[00:14:14] people have to understand why something is important. What do you have to understand and
[00:14:19] decentralized command? What's the command? What's the command? What do you have to understand here?
[00:14:22] What is the intent of the learning? It goes on. Learning is much more than gathering information
[00:14:30] and reciting facts and includes cognitive, physical, social, emotional, ethical, and cultural
[00:14:38] components. Learning occurs in formal settings, like schoolhouse or training exercise, and informal
[00:14:44] settings such as social experiential, self-directed, and other ways outside the classroom.
[00:14:51] The developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes interact to influence how Marines think, respond,
[00:14:58] and act. Is it weird to think about every single thing that you do is based on what you've learned?
[00:15:09] Now, you can take the Sam Harris approach here and say that you have no free will. Yes.
[00:15:15] And then you'd have to say, okay, well, if you want to take that into the philosophical world,
[00:15:20] Sam, we get it. I'm not here to argue philosophy with Sam Harris. What I am going to tell you is this,
[00:15:26] when I would see young leaders make decisions. They were making decisions based on what they learned,
[00:15:33] what they experienced. That's where it all comes from. Learning encompasses both training and
[00:15:43] education, which are equally important and complementary. A simple explanations of the difference
[00:15:50] between training and education is that training prepares Marines to deal with known factors of war,
[00:15:55] while education prepares Marines to deal with unknown factors. It's an interesting
[00:16:02] bifurcation of those two things. I'm going to take me a little while to get my head around that,
[00:16:08] because I know a lot of the training that I ran, the purpose of the training was to get
[00:16:13] seals to learn how to deal with unknown factors. So we may have to explore that one a little bit.
[00:16:21] I don't think they're mutually exclusive, but they are different.
[00:16:27] Yeah, well, maybe we'll have to explore what they see as training and what they see as education.
[00:16:34] We'll get there. This is when I read this, I wasn't. I just, I underlined unknown factors. And I was
[00:16:40] like, yeah, of course, unknown factors. That's what we're trying to teach. Teach people how to deal with unknown
[00:16:44] factors. Training, I guess, I guess where they draw the line is like, hey, here's the, here's the
[00:16:52] procedures that we can teach you, right? That's your training. Learn this procedure, learn this procedure,
[00:16:56] learn this procedure. Education is how do you take those procedures that you've learned and
[00:17:00] who'd happen to this random new thing that you haven't seen before? Well, this is understandable.
[00:17:05] All right, I'll begin to wield my yield, I'll begin to yield to this thought process here. Training
[00:17:14] education are both a compulsion different ways, but they are required working together to instill
[00:17:20] the learning that results in readiness and effectiveness. The complexity of the modern battle field
[00:17:25] and increasing rate of change requires a highly educated force. While different education and training
[00:17:32] are inextrippically linked, education denotes study and intellectual development. Training is primarily
[00:17:40] learning by doing. Okay, so now they're laying it out of the way. Education notes study
[00:17:46] and intellectual development. Training is primarily learning by doing. Okay, we will, we will not
[00:17:54] train without the presence of education, and we must not educate without the complimentary
[00:17:57] execution of well-consuming training. Okay, I see where they're going. I'm not sure that I would
[00:18:05] I'm not sure that I would have presented this the same way. I might have to, I would have to think about this.
[00:18:15] Because training is learning by doing. Okay, I get it. Your hands on, your making stuff happen,
[00:18:20] and education is not. Education is study and intellectual development. That's what they're saying here.
[00:18:31] Okay, I think I'm starting to grasp it a little bit better.
[00:18:36] Because here's how I just grasped it in my mind. The mission of both these things is to learn.
[00:18:44] Right, and both of them result in learning. In my mind, I was thinking, well, one is one you learn
[00:18:53] and one you don't learn, but the actual fact is both these things you're going to learn.
[00:18:57] It's just a method of learning. One of them is one of them is study and one of them is doing.
[00:19:03] Yeah, it's almost seems like a small thing, but I don't think it's not. I mean, it's a big
[00:19:08] thing to understand the difference between those two is that if you were just training all the time
[00:19:13] and never really getting an education on what you're doing or studying or learning the bigger picture
[00:19:17] that training wouldn't be nearly as useful. You wouldn't learn as much. If you weren't
[00:19:22] educating yourself, why you're doing it, I know they talk more about it, but there's this idea
[00:19:26] like if I'm going to go to the rifle range and get really good at shooting the rifle,
[00:19:31] I could train on the rifle over and over and over again. I could do the same thing in
[00:19:34] airplane. I could train over and over again. But on the education comes from other components,
[00:19:39] like what the aircraft that I'm fighting against could do, what my enemies capable of, what the
[00:19:43] 3D environment might be, and that training evolves because of the education. And if all I ever did
[00:19:50] was sort of think about what that looked like in 3D about a space and never trained for it,
[00:19:54] that education by itself, I wouldn't learn as much about doing the training with it.
[00:19:58] Yeah, yeah, no, I'm seeing it. I'm seeing it.
[00:20:05] Mm.
[00:20:08] Continuing on, Marines must always seek better ways to learn throughout the entire continuum
[00:20:13] of the training of training and education. Throughout this publication, the term learning is emphasized.
[00:20:18] Training and education are you specifically referring to one or the other. Learning is the
[00:20:23] overall intended outcome of both training and education. So there you go. Interesting, we. That must
[00:20:30] have been a little clogged thing in my brain for when I read this. Marines continuously learn
[00:20:36] to be ready for the constantly changing and increasing demands of warfare and the range of missions.
[00:20:41] As Marine Corps, doctrinal publication six command and control explains, we earn the trust of others
[00:20:47] by demonstrating competence, a sense of responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline.
[00:20:54] We just talked about that on the last podcast, right? The number one way to
[00:20:57] to earn trust is competence. Think about that. We earn the trust of others by our own self-discipline.
[00:21:09] Competence is having sufficient knowledge, judgment, and skills to perform a particular duty
[00:21:14] job or function. Marines improve competencies through formal and informal learning opportunities
[00:21:20] that develop the required knowledge skills and attitudes. Marines learn to address complex
[00:21:24] problems and develop teamwork wherever they may be, whether in garrison deployed or in formal
[00:21:30] formal learning centers. Learning enables Marines to think critically, develop judgment,
[00:21:35] and cultivate a bias for action without waiting to be told what to do.
[00:21:43] The purpose learning enables Marines to think critically, develop judgment and cultivate a bias
[00:21:48] for action without waiting to be told what to do. That is such the opposite of what people think
[00:21:53] that the military is. Everyone thinks this is what we told what to do. And here, the actual words
[00:22:00] are don't wait to be told what to do is the actual words, a bias for action. A Marine with knowledge
[00:22:07] and skills who lack judgment requires close supervision, which may not be possible in combat
[00:22:11] conditions hence decentralized command. One, our Marine Corps ethos demands competence,
[00:22:17] responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline as military professionals charge with the
[00:22:21] fence of the nation. Learning prepares Marines to exercise initiative within the commanders in
[00:22:26] tent, constantly seeking to improve developmental agility and deal with changing situations.
[00:22:36] Whoever was the guy writing this went out of his way to not just say discipline.
[00:22:42] Because I always think military, that's actually not what it is. That by itself is not enough.
[00:22:47] Yep, he's making it perfectly clear to everyone that we're not going to impose discipline
[00:22:52] on you. You need self-discipline. That's what you need.
[00:22:58] Decentralized command.
[00:23:02] Next section, the role of learning in war fighting maneuver warfare requires intelligent leaders
[00:23:07] at all levels who possess a bias for intelligent action. Oh, he just threw a little change
[00:23:12] at you. Yeah. And intelligent actions, not just action because we don't want you just to take
[00:23:16] action. We want you to do something smart. Success in land warfare depends on Marines developing
[00:23:21] an intellectual edge to accurately recognize cues, make sense of the information,
[00:23:25] and respond effectively. This intellectual edge is based on developed knowledge and experience
[00:23:31] that allows Marines to shape conditions and events to their advantage. Developing fundamental
[00:23:36] cognitive competencies such as problem framing, mental imaging, critical thinking, analysis,
[00:23:42] synthesis, reasoning, and problem solving enables Marines to make effective decisions more
[00:23:47] quickly in time constrained operational environments when they often have incomplete inaccurate
[00:23:53] or even contradictory information. There you go. And this is one of those, what I was reading
[00:24:03] this sentence yesterday, you are editing some of my work, maybe a couple of weeks ago. And you
[00:24:09] said, hey, you know this sentence that you wrote here, a lot in there, you used a lot of words here.
[00:24:15] Think about it. Maybe you could tighten this up. And I read it and I was like, yeah, I'm not typing.
[00:24:20] I said, you remember that one sentence you said, yeah, I said, I said, I didn't, I'm not changing.
[00:24:26] And when I read this sentence, I thought about that. I was like, well, could we have kind of
[00:24:31] made this a little bit more concise? But then I read it again. I thought to myself,
[00:24:36] no, this, every one of these, what would you take out? Yeah, what do you take out? What do you
[00:24:41] take out? What do you take out? What do you take out? What do you take out? Where you don't lose
[00:24:44] some level of meaning. And you know, this, this kind of sentence right here,
[00:24:48] you know, if you're a young Marine out there, that's that's reading this for the first time,
[00:24:52] you're going for a second. I didn't, you know, they didn't cover this and in, you know, junior,
[00:24:58] junior high school English, right? So you have to break it down a little bit. You have to go,
[00:25:02] what are they talking about? Develop, developing fundamental cognitive competencies. Okay, what does
[00:25:07] that mean? That means I need to be able to think about these things. Okay? What I need to be able to think
[00:25:13] about? I need to think about problem framing. What does that mean? It means assessing, looking at
[00:25:19] things in a certain way. Mental imaging. Okay, what do I see in those things? Critical thinking,
[00:25:24] are I now I need to think about them? I need to analyze those things. I need to synthesize,
[00:25:29] I need to take all those things and put them together. I need to reason through them and then I need
[00:25:33] to problem solve. Yeah. So that's, there's a lot going on there. Yeah, and those are just synonyms,
[00:25:38] it just repeat yourself. Those are different things. Yeah. And I was, I wrote, I got notes all throughout
[00:25:44] this thing. But obviously the Marine Corps, the title of this section is the role of learning
[00:25:48] and war fighting. Well, that's, that's cool because there's the Marine Corps, we're about war fighting.
[00:25:52] If you take out the word marine, take out the word war fighting. This is describing life.
[00:25:56] I want to talk about how is this applicable to my world? I have to make decisions when I don't
[00:26:01] have, when I have incomplete inaccurate or contradictory information. When don't you have that?
[00:26:06] War fighting, it's a no-brainer, but it's actually true everywhere. I mean, this thing is,
[00:26:10] it's written so clearly for any situation. Yeah.
[00:26:16] A central tentative maneuver warfare is attacking the enemies ability to make decisions and shift
[00:26:21] the mental aspects of warfare to the Marines' advantage. In short, Marines develop an intellectual
[00:26:27] edge by learning cognitive skills and competencies that enable them to move through the
[00:26:33] observe orient-decide and act cycle often referred to as the U-to-loop, more quickly and effectively
[00:26:37] than the enemy. The war fighter who recognizes what is happening adapts the situation and makes
[00:26:43] and then makes effective decisions in the shortest amount of time will typically have an advantage.
[00:26:47] The U-to-loop decision-making cycles even more important in preparation for future conflicts
[00:26:52] because as new technologies emerge, the rate of change will continue to increase.
[00:26:57] Therefore, Marines must continuously improve their knowledge and skills by leveraging
[00:27:01] technology but never depend upon technology alone as the solution. We're back to Colonel Boyd.
[00:27:10] Marine should observe their environment to recognize key cues, synthesize these cues to
[00:27:19] orient and quickly make sense of the information in order to decide and act and then Marines will
[00:27:23] start the cycle again as they observe the effects of their actions. So, you're a play chess.
[00:27:32] Yes. Are you good? No. But I can play. Okay. So, so you think you can take me? No.
[00:27:40] Okay. Check. You probably could. I don't know if I could chess play or not. I don't play chess.
[00:27:46] Okay. So, I know how to play but I don't play it. But I understand the game.
[00:27:52] So, one thing that's interesting about the game is and there's a great documentary about
[00:27:58] the current world champion in chess and I've freed his last name as first name as Magnus.
[00:28:06] Yeah. I watched it. I know it's talking. Yeah. Yeah. So, what's cool is
[00:28:11] and when I learned from watching that documentary is that when you're a good chess player,
[00:28:16] you're seeing patterns. You're just seeing chunks of the board and you can take all those pieces
[00:28:20] that are there and you understand the whole thing. And then the better you are, the more chunks
[00:28:26] you understand and the more you understand how they're going to play out. And it's the same thing.
[00:28:29] Now, when you take that and you look at, you know, if you look at Gigiitsu, like I see where your
[00:28:33] arm is and I know what that indicates, the three possibilities that you have and one of those
[00:28:38] possibilities isn't really a possibility because you also have your leg over here. So, that means two
[00:28:42] possibilities. And so, you can see these chunks. You can see things and you can react to it. And then,
[00:28:47] as you get good at reacting to seeing these chunks and get good at reacting to pattern recognition,
[00:28:52] what makes it so, what happens is you see pattern, you get pattern recognition.
[00:29:00] And what makes it easy isn't that you, it's not that I see a pattern and I see a pattern,
[00:29:07] I see a pattern, I see a pattern, I know what's doing, I know what's doing, too. That's easy. That's
[00:29:10] like level one. That's your white belt, fought process. But what makes it easy when you're operating
[00:29:18] a high level is you see the chunks, you see the patterns that you recognize and you know what's
[00:29:23] to do. But then you see a small outlier and you're able to recognize it. If you didn't know those
[00:29:27] patterns, you wouldn't recognize that outlier at all. As soon as you see that outliner, because all
[00:29:31] those chunks, those other pieces are where they are, you go, oh, outlier? I understand how that
[00:29:36] outlier fits into this whole picture and I can solve that problem. I can solve it a thousand times faster
[00:29:44] than someone that has to take all the different chunks and all these different things and put them
[00:29:48] together. So when we're training Marines or training humans, what we're trying to get good at is
[00:29:54] that whole process right there. And when I see something, I go, oh, this is what's happening. Okay,
[00:29:59] I see that, yeah, I'm going to do this and I see that, I'm going to do this. Oh, here, out of the
[00:30:02] five things that took me no thought whatsoever, I can solve those without even thinking, I know what
[00:30:07] to do. And then there's this one outlier thing that I see and I go, oh, that's the way that's different.
[00:30:12] And if I had to deal, if I had to deal with each of those five chunks in an individual basis and
[00:30:17] solve each one of those problems, I wouldn't even notice that outlier. I wouldn't even see it.
[00:30:22] But when I see it, when I recognize everything and I pattern recognition on five things or
[00:30:27] four out of five things that one thing that I don't recognize, I can focus my efforts on it and I can
[00:30:31] get it solved. And that's what you're trying to train leaders to do. Is recognize even,
[00:30:37] even when we talk about dealing with people, right, dealing with, you know, you're in a leadership
[00:30:42] position. Here's the nine different types of, you know, if you and I, if I say, I got to go talk to
[00:30:47] this guy who's, you know, has a bad temper and you and I'll roll plant. And there's eight things that
[00:30:53] will cover and I'll be like, yep, if he does this, if he does that, I'll do that. And then when I walk
[00:30:57] in and confront you about this or talk to you about this, seven of those things that you throw
[00:31:02] at me, I'm already ready for. And that means when you hit me with the one that I didn't expect,
[00:31:07] it's cool because I can just go, okay, I see what he's, I see what he is, I see what's happening.
[00:31:12] I have the other part, Tandel, and I can just focus on this one little thing right now,
[00:31:15] which is, I see what's happening. He's really committed to this part of his plan. Okay, cool.
[00:31:20] Hey, you know what, I think that one part of your plan, I think that's actually one of the
[00:31:24] better plans I've seen. And all of a sudden, I solve that thing. Which if I went into that room
[00:31:30] without recognizing the other patterns, I never would have even seen that outlier. Yeah.
[00:31:34] That's a really complex thing that I just tried to explain. How did I do? Echo, did I do it?
[00:31:39] Yeah, pretty good. Not that. Maybe this is just, maybe add to it. But yes, so you have the eight
[00:31:46] scenarios and, you know, nine scenarios out of the ten and whatever that you know, the one that you
[00:31:52] don't necessarily know. If you're thorough with the nine that you know, you know why you have
[00:31:58] the solutions, like the solutions are the solutions for these nine that you do know for reasons,
[00:32:03] right. So you know about all those reasons. So when that tenth one comes, you don't know the
[00:32:07] solution, but you know all the reasoning behind the other solutions and you apply those that reasoning. Yes.
[00:32:11] So I'm saying, so yes, I dig it. You're, you're talking about running, they reference this
[00:32:19] Udolup, which they do, the Marine Corps uses, I mean, boy, basically drove maneuver or warfare
[00:32:24] from the Marine Corps with that concept. But you're really talking about running Udolup with all
[00:32:29] these different loops at the same time and the real key is to find the one where the point of
[00:32:33] friction really is. And that's why if you're in our plane, this linear game, just you against me,
[00:32:38] and this one thing, it doesn't really make a difference. But if I'm running seven or eight and I recognize
[00:32:44] it, this is the one where the friction really is and you don't even, you have no clues even there.
[00:32:48] I'm not even worried about the other ones. Now, I need to keep up with those things. I can't ignore
[00:32:51] them, but I'm going to solve this thing and I'll be making decisions to maneuver this place where I want it
[00:32:56] and you won't even know that it's happening. That's how common you said, are you going to beat me
[00:32:59] in chess? I'm like, well, if you actually know how to play chess, I'm not going to beat you,
[00:33:04] because I'm actually sort of still displaying checkers. But you are off your solving this other problem
[00:33:09] that I'm not even paying attention to and you might have eight, nine, ten multiple Udolup
[00:33:12] to the same time of getting all these different things, but only you have to figure out the one that matters.
[00:33:16] And if I don't know what you're doing, I'm not even competing with you. I'm losing and I'll be no
[00:33:20] way. Yeah. And as I was talking about, we hear the other day. Yeah. I'm running Udolups on top. I'm
[00:33:27] running Udolups with Udolups inside it. Yeah. So it's like, here's four or five things that are going
[00:33:32] on, but there's a bigger thing that's going on outside of that. We got Udolups going on inside of
[00:33:37] Udolups and, and you can't do none of these things. You can't deal with the seven Udolups going
[00:33:42] on at the same time and identify the other one. You can't do Udolups within Udolups if you get caught
[00:33:47] up in those loops yourself. You got to be able to detach that back and the more that you train to
[00:33:52] do that, the easier it becomes to recognize these things, these outliers and you're able to focus
[00:33:59] your mind where you need to focus it and make decisions properly. Yep. And sometimes those cues are
[00:34:07] minuscule and subtle and you can almost unidentifiable, but if you've done it enough, oh yeah,
[00:34:13] if you have done it a lot, the more you do it, these things, these little tiny unnoticeable things,
[00:34:22] start to just look like just giant red flasks, so easy to see. And you go, there's the flank coming
[00:34:29] out me. Yep. I remember, Top Gunn, you do a lot of one against one, a lot of BFF. I kind of
[00:34:36] feels somewhat two-dimensional linear. It kind of is, but there's a million little cues that
[00:34:40] takes a lot of experience and I remember fighting with someone and probably halfway through the fight
[00:34:47] and debriefing kind of recognizing. This is the place here where I knew that these other things were
[00:34:51] no longer going to happen and this is going to happen. I maneuvered here, that's how I got behind
[00:34:54] you and killed you and said, how did you know this was going to happen here when I was, you know,
[00:34:58] five of those previous in the chess board and I'm like, well, look at across the horizon,
[00:35:02] you're leading edge flaps are kind of dug in a little bit lower than normal, which means you
[00:35:06] were at least between, I don't know, 220 and 240 knots. Let's go to your tape and it's 277 knots.
[00:35:13] And he's like, how, and I'm like, look, I'm not smarter than you, but I have seen that and I've
[00:35:18] looked for that and I noticed your three degrees above the horizon, which means you're going
[00:35:22] a little bit slower, which means you don't have these options anymore. I don't have to worry
[00:35:26] about you going up. So I'm making these decisions based on what and he doesn't even know those things
[00:35:30] are happening and it's like you said those cues, but after a while, those cues become so easy
[00:35:35] to see. Yeah, there's four or five Oedalooops that are going, you can throw them all, throw
[00:35:40] four from away the fifth one. Oh, yeah, here's where he's going next. Got it. And I'm going to be
[00:35:43] right here waiting for him. Totally. Good luck. I'm going to start maneuvering on this chess board.
[00:35:47] You don't even know what's happening and then you're going to make your move like I'm already
[00:35:49] set up to the point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Next through progressive learning experience
[00:35:56] Marines at all levels develop a bias for action, enabled by adaptive rapid decision making. The
[00:36:03] more Marines learn and exercise this bias for action, the better it becomes. Once again, the more
[00:36:09] Marines learn and exercise this bias for action, the better becomes. And this is something that
[00:36:13] you know, on EF online last week, a guy said, hey, I'm not an aggressive leader. You know,
[00:36:22] what do I do? I'm not an aggressive leader. How do I get better? And I said, well, first of all,
[00:36:29] and I laid out the whole thing like when you're talking and we ended up covering a similar question
[00:36:33] on the podcast, which is like, hey, aggressive doesn't mean loudening your face. It doesn't mean
[00:36:37] getting crazy. Aggressive means you are making your taking action. It's aggressively pursuing action.
[00:36:43] And one of the things that I use is people say, how can I train someone to be more aggressive?
[00:36:47] It's real easy. You put them in situations where if they're not aggressive, they die.
[00:36:53] Or whatever metaphorical world you live in, hey, if you don't call the client, the client's going
[00:36:58] to blow up and you're going to lose the deal. If you don't solve this problem with your electrical
[00:37:04] system, that electrosystems going to fail, and it's going to be a disaster. So what you learn to do is
[00:37:09] go, okay, I'm not 100% sure what to do, but I'm going to do something right now and make something
[00:37:12] happen. And you must, I mean, this was super easy for me because I would put an element out in the
[00:37:18] field. There's, you know, there's some seals on us, alter a target and has there a
[00:37:22] something to target, you know, they'll have a single shooter now buying building. And they learn real
[00:37:29] quick if they do nothing cool, that guy's going to get his friends and he's going to kick their ass.
[00:37:33] And if they do something aggressive, they'll get that problem solved before it even really becomes
[00:37:37] a problem. So you can learn a bias for action. And that's how you learn it. And by the way,
[00:37:44] sometimes you, you do something aggressive and it doesn't work out the way you want it to.
[00:37:49] You're playing, you're playing a little bit, there's a gambling, right? There's a, there's an odds,
[00:37:55] there's odds to be played. And we covered this couple podcasts ago, you're playing the odds, right?
[00:38:00] And odds are seven out of ten times, your aggressive move is going to be the right move.
[00:38:07] Three out of ten times, maybe it wasn't the best move, but you, you got to play the odds.
[00:38:12] And that's also why we do it a revision making because just because I'm doing something aggressive
[00:38:15] doesn't mean that I go all in and sacrifice everything else. No, I make a small move in the
[00:38:19] direction that I think is right aggressively. And then I lead my feedback loop off of that.
[00:38:27] Continuing, although war games are training exercises, approximate the conditions of war,
[00:38:31] Marines cannot fully replicate the dangers complexities, emotions and friction of actual combat.
[00:38:37] Marines experience a variety of training situations that approximate combat situations,
[00:38:41] so that learned experiences can be remembered and applied during the stresses and friction of combat
[00:38:47] through both direct and indirect experiences and Marines develop a realistic appreciation
[00:38:52] for what is possible in combat and what is not. So one of the things that I used to tell guys,
[00:38:59] one of the failings of training for me when I was training, when I was running training,
[00:39:03] was we in paintball, we had laser guns to simulate, one thing that I could not simulate
[00:39:08] is fear of death because I couldn't do it with my trade at role players because they'd be like,
[00:39:18] hey, we're going to die, we're going to get some, and that's a little bit more realistic because
[00:39:21] you could say, hey, these are geologists and they don't care if they die cool. But the seals
[00:39:26] to say, like, you know, there's a downman in the middle of the street and in one second,
[00:39:32] there's four seals running out to save them. When those rounds are hitting, it's going to take a
[00:39:39] moment. You know, it's going to take some color fire, it's going to take a moment. So that's the
[00:39:43] one thing I would have a hard time simulating is, hey, you're going to be afraid. And even if
[00:39:49] you're not afraid, two of the guys, three of the guys that are with you are going to be afraid,
[00:39:54] are not going to want to step into that alleyway, they're not going to step away into the street
[00:39:57] or whatever. And so you got to calculate for that. So I would try and get people to behave as if,
[00:40:02] you know, you do this, you, you die. When I read this, I was thinking of a story, you've told me,
[00:40:10] you tell the story a lot is a story about stoner in his first combat mission. And you go to the
[00:40:17] story, what happens in the guy after the thing is that the the Battalion Commander, the Hewzer
[00:40:20] is working, it's like man, there was a mid team leader, a mid team major, he was a major in the mid team,
[00:40:26] which by the way, just real quick, mid team that meant he had been, you know, in in Ramadi for five
[00:40:33] months getting in gun fights. But yeah, totally. And just the point where he's like, hey, man,
[00:40:38] obviously you've been in a ton of these experiences and kind of, and you're like, actually Seth was like,
[00:40:42] no, it was my first time. But even like, I was even looking at the little things like this training
[00:40:46] approximate combat situations. They were smart enough to not say replicates or is it's not the same.
[00:40:52] But it's just enough to get you to be prepared for what you're going to see. And actually if you do it,
[00:40:57] well, you can't make it perfect. But if you do it well, that's exactly how people respond in that
[00:41:01] most chaotic thing, which was exactly what happened to Stoner. No, yeah, it's and I would have
[00:41:06] guys all the time come back and say, oh yeah, thanks for the training. Because it was as good as it gets.
[00:41:10] Totally fast forward a little bit. Marines need to develop the memory skills
[00:41:20] because Marines as human beings increasingly tend to digitally store and search for information
[00:41:25] rather than committing information to short-term or long-term memory. Marines cannot always rely on
[00:41:29] technologies or on being able to digitally search for information during combat due to many
[00:41:34] reasons such as time constraints, lack of network access or the need to minimize electronic
[00:41:39] segmentures. Therefore, Marines at all levels need to train their minds to memorize and recall
[00:41:44] important information to reflect upon that knowledge, to develop understanding and to frequently
[00:41:48] exercise these skills through training so that information could be recalled and stinktively
[00:41:53] during combat. And I forgot to mention that yes, I am skipping forward through some of this
[00:42:01] information. But you know, it's just because we're not going to do it. We're going to try not to do
[00:42:05] this 17 hour podcast on this one manual. I was wondering how are you going to not read the whole
[00:42:10] part. I was wondering it too, especially in the opening when you're just going, okay, this whole thing.
[00:42:14] Totally. This whole thing is good. Next section key principles of learning.
[00:42:23] The first learning principle is know yourself and seek self-improvement.
[00:42:28] A Marines mindset values ethics and experiences impact his or her learning decisions
[00:42:35] and actions. Once again, sorry Sam Harris. We do have free will or at least Marines on the
[00:42:44] battlefield Sam Harris have free will to make decisions and take actions based on the impact of
[00:42:50] their learning based on their mindset, based on their values based on their ethics, based on their
[00:42:55] experiences. Fast forward a little bit when Marines are aware of how perspectives and experiences
[00:43:01] shape their thinking. They can better identify assumptions, biases, and other factors that influence
[00:43:06] learning. Previous experiences are valuable for many reasons, such as providing personalized
[00:43:12] references to integrate new knowledge, skills and experience in the memory. Marines learn in
[00:43:17] fight effectively despite friction, which has been described as the force in war that makes
[00:43:23] the apparently easy, so difficult. Learning is not always easy. A lack of self-awareness,
[00:43:30] emotional regulation, humility, time management, or biases can cause friction that makes learning
[00:43:38] more difficult. Yeah, check it out. If you're not self-aware, if you can't regulate your emotions,
[00:43:43] if you're not humble, if you don't have good time management, or if you have biases,
[00:43:47] you're going to be hard to learn. Which are all natural things, by the way. Which are all natural
[00:43:54] things, which are all things that we kind of every, by naturalizing me mean like that's where we
[00:43:59] tend. Yes. We tend to lack self-awareness. We tend to not be able to control our emotions. We tend
[00:44:05] to lack humility. We tend not to be able to do time management. We tend to have biases.
[00:44:10] Yeah, thank you all, correct. I go to Charles. Marines overcome this friction and seek
[00:44:17] self-improvement by better understanding themselves, particularly how our values ethics and
[00:44:21] perspectives influence the learning. And now I think it's important to remember that when we're
[00:44:27] talking about learning in that context right there, I'm talking about hey, what I learned from this
[00:44:31] class or this training, it's what am I learning on the battlefield? What am I seeing and how are my
[00:44:36] biases negatively impacting how I'm able to take on this new information and adapt to it?
[00:44:43] Because that's what happens. You know, you have this idea in your head of how things should be
[00:44:51] and therefore when the enemy does something you don't expect you, you don't accept it. You act
[00:44:56] like it happened in a different way. They couldn't, they just got lucky. You make excuses for yourself,
[00:45:01] you make excuses for the enemy, they got lucky. They can't do that again. Those are your biases,
[00:45:08] preventing you from learning. I mean, we must have, we did that like crazy in Iraq. We as a
[00:45:16] country, right? Oh, they can't be, this can't be an organized campaign. So just, there's just some
[00:45:21] rattle browsers out there. But we just wouldn't accept it. This isn't an insert and these are just some
[00:45:26] outpoggots. I'll be drawing some discruntled folks around here. I fast forward a year and a half,
[00:45:31] two years. We got a full fledged insert as he on our hands. What's a rattle browser? Some of that just causes problems.
[00:45:41] Second principle, the second learning principle is be ready and willing to learn.
[00:45:45] You wouldn't think you'd have to say that. Yeah, but you do without a doubt. Even that first one of
[00:45:55] know yourself and seek self improvement, it seems like that would be a natural tendency to do that.
[00:46:00] It's actually not your ego. At some point, it gives like you don't need to keep learning. You
[00:46:05] don't need to get better. You don't need to improve. And the reason it's in there is that not only
[00:46:10] is it natural, like you were saying, that is an overwhelming powerful force. Your own ego telling
[00:46:16] you, bro, you've got this thing figured out. Yeah, you know, know yourself. Yeah, yeah. Who knows
[00:46:24] me better than myself? Right? It's over there, quote, Sun Siu, better one, echo Charles. No,
[00:46:29] well, I'm just saying you said it in there. So you ever seen your set well? You're probably different,
[00:46:34] but us normal people, we sometimes will see ourselves on camera or hear our own voice on in a
[00:46:42] recording and be like, oh my gosh, you can't believe I sound like that. Meanwhile, you know who
[00:46:47] listens to your voice 100% of the time you yet. You still don't really know yourself because when
[00:46:52] you see it kind of, you know, detached from you doing it in the moment, it seems different for
[00:46:56] Sunri then. Isn't that weird? So we kind of don't know ourselves, I think. Yeah, I would say there's
[00:47:03] very few people that when they hear themselves, they go, yep, that's what I sound like. Yeah,
[00:47:07] especially at first, after a while, you know, yeah, you get used to it or whatever, but at the end of
[00:47:12] day, that's a common thing. I think for people where they see themselves and or they hear
[00:47:18] themselves and they're like, oh, and there for some reason moved by it in one way or another,
[00:47:22] you know, like they haven't been with themselves their whole life kind of thing. You know,
[00:47:26] like it's some kind of weird surprise or something like that. So it's kind of like, no, you don't
[00:47:29] really know yourself. I think you for the most part anyway, like you experience little little
[00:47:36] slivers of yourself while you're behaving and then you kind of paint your own picture. Like,
[00:47:41] oh, I just said that I must have sounded real cool saying that. I mean, while you hear a
[00:47:45] played back, you like dang it and it's a little. Yeah, those are those are valid. You know what's
[00:47:50] interesting about this section right here. So we start off saying, now, you know, this is,
[00:47:54] this is, what's good about the ring course? You know, this is taking a Lance Corp on Canary
[00:47:57] this and and Gunny Sergeant can read this and a Colonel can read this and they all can like understand it.
[00:48:04] Here's what's interesting about this. This section right here, believe it or not, in my humble opinion,
[00:48:10] is actually aimed at the Colonel because the Lance Corp was like, hey, brah I'm here to learn.
[00:48:16] Yeah, I got my mind is wide open. It's the Colonel and the Gunny or the Master Guns,
[00:48:21] that's like I already got this or already have this depending if it's the Gunny or the
[00:48:29] Colonel or the Colonel. Yeah, because the minute that you think you know everything
[00:48:34] is the minute that you are not ready and willing to learn and that's when you're going backwards.
[00:48:39] So this section right here, they actually aimed this section point blank
[00:48:45] at this, the senior people that think they know because those those young kids man, they're
[00:48:49] ready to learn. They're not sitting there going on, you know this. I mean, it's like a new guy in a
[00:48:53] seal put in. That guy's that kid's ready to learn. But once you're a senior and listed guy or you're
[00:48:59] a more senior officer, all of a sudden you know anything, you know everything.
[00:49:07] Marines have the professional responsibility to learn throughout their careers and should always
[00:49:11] seek opportunities to learn. Marines must take an active role in learning, be intellectually
[00:49:14] curious and look for new ways to adapt when they have learned to adapt what they learn to other
[00:49:21] relevant situations. There are many factors that indicate a person's willingness and readiness to
[00:49:25] learn such physical, behavioral, societal, emotional, and cognitive skills. Additionally, humility,
[00:49:31] courage, integrity, perseverance, motivation, and discipline are other key qualities that affect the
[00:49:35] learning readiness. What's the number one humility? Interesting courage is number two. Why is that?
[00:49:43] Because what kind of person just says, you know, I already got this. Right? Or they don't have the
[00:49:48] courage to raise your hand. That's what I should have said. The person that humbless not humble says,
[00:49:52] you know, I already got this. The person that lacks courage won't go, hey, you know what,
[00:49:56] a boss, you know what, I don't really understand this. Can you can you tell me this again? That
[00:50:00] takes courage. You're in a group of people, raise your hand. Man, when I was going to college and I was
[00:50:04] a 20, whatever year old man going to college with a bunch of 18 year olds, I had, I had a
[00:50:11] preponderance of moral courage. The front of the classroom, I'd be like, a professor, I don't understand
[00:50:15] that. Can you go over that again? Yeah. And it made me so much do so much better because, you know,
[00:50:21] I guarantee this kids in the back of class, they don't understand something. They're not going to say
[00:50:24] anything and look stupid. I didn't care. Yeah. So you have that courage integrity, perseverance,
[00:50:28] motivation and discipline. Starts with humility and with discipline. I like this book.
[00:50:35] Marines increase their learning readiness by having courage, perseverance and discipline to
[00:50:39] continuously seek new professional knowledge skills and experiences. A Marines learning can be
[00:50:43] facilitated by developing an awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes.
[00:50:49] Marine sharpen their intellect by studying how to think better than applying these skills to improve
[00:50:54] as learners, leaders and decision makers. The third principle is to understand why you are learning.
[00:51:04] And this is what's key. What you can take away from this. Hey, look, apply this to yourself.
[00:51:07] For sure, apply it to your kids, apply it to your students, apply it to the people that you work with.
[00:51:14] You want to make sure everyone understands why they're learning, especially the kids. Like, yeah,
[00:51:18] for you absolutely apply it, but as an instructor, you can you can reverse engineer this as an
[00:51:23] instructor and you lead with why something is important to know. And that will help people open their
[00:51:29] brains. When Marines understand why they are learning concepts and skills, they better understand
[00:51:36] the importance of learning to the mission and are more motivated to learn.
[00:51:40] By understanding the context of learning, Marines are better able to apply concepts and skills,
[00:51:44] new situations, increasing their confidence in that adaptability. Unknowns, uncertainty and
[00:51:49] disorder will never be eliminated in battle. Information may be unclear, misinterpreted,
[00:51:54] influenced by the enemy or communication systems may fail. When Marines understand why they
[00:51:59] are learning, it enables them to focus on learning of the known and adapting to the familiar
[00:52:05] and adapting to the unfamiliar more quickly and effectively than the enemy. That's the outlier thing
[00:52:12] we just talked about. Yeah. I see all the things that you're doing. I see the nine pattern
[00:52:17] recognitions. There's the one outlier I'm on it. Outlearning the enemy, therefore, it's key
[00:52:22] outfitting the enemy. That's a big deal. Outlearning the enemy is the key to outfining. Not the
[00:52:31] brute force, not getting bigger equipment or stronger things. It's outlearning it. That's how you're
[00:52:36] going to win. Yeah. When you start to look at learning as a skill that's required for battle,
[00:52:43] you start to look at it different. Yes. Totally. And then you could start breaking down. How am I
[00:52:49] going to go about learning? What am I paying attention to? How do I assess things that I'm hearing?
[00:52:56] How do I assemble all that knowledge together? There's a lot that goes into it. Dude, there's a ton
[00:53:03] and if I wasn't around when somebody decided we need to put a doctrinal pub around learning
[00:53:10] for the Marine Corps. But it's a really good idea. And it probably came from someone who was like
[00:53:15] me that as a second lieutenant who had a pile of things that I was supposed to learn when I got to
[00:53:21] the Basics School and they gave me all these same pubs, warfitting, tactics, strategy. And learning
[00:53:26] to me was I'm going to read this and find the answers in these books so I can take the test and
[00:53:32] pass and be really good. And I'm going to learn what the answers are, which is totally wrong,
[00:53:38] totally different. And the sooner the force, any organization figures out how to crack the code
[00:53:42] and getting people to actually want to do this for their own self-interest, the better. And I'm
[00:53:48] sure that that's a driver behind this as a generation of people going, I'm learning what the answers
[00:53:52] are and that is not learning. That is not an effective way to do. And that's partly the reason
[00:53:56] I'm mad as is so credible because the things he talked about more than anything, he doesn't talk
[00:54:00] about combat nearly as much as he talks about all the preparation he did and all the things that he
[00:54:05] read and that's what people figured out about mad as is what made him brilliant was how much he
[00:54:10] he read and studied. And each time he read and studied he got a little bit of pattern recognition
[00:54:17] understood things better. Kind of a little smarter. Got a little bit smarter. Learned. Yes.
[00:54:25] Second Lieutenant Burke didn't learn nearly as much as he showed out. Yeah, you know and that's one
[00:54:30] of the things you know on the thread podcast, you know, I talk about the fact that everything's
[00:54:35] connected and when things aren't when you don't make the connections between things, it'd be like
[00:54:38] if you started taking you to a people like, okay this is the armlock. You're going to learn
[00:54:42] that in the armlock room and then you go into another room with another instructor and they teach
[00:54:47] you the triangle and then you go to another room with another instructor and they teach you the sweep.
[00:54:54] All those things by themselves, they're not meaningless but they have,
[00:54:59] they low value. Very low value, comparatively speaking. So that was the original idea of the thread
[00:55:06] podcast was listen. People don't connect everything and everything's connected. Connect things.
[00:55:19] The fourth learning principle is to provide and receive constructive feedback. One cannot learn
[00:55:24] without feedback. It is critical to learning and developing adaptability. There are two sources of
[00:55:30] feedback. Intrinsic sources, IE internal and extrinsic sources, IE external. For example, a Marine's own
[00:55:39] perception that he or she jerked the trigger when shooting a rifle, then adjusting the trigger
[00:55:43] pull on the next shot would be an example of intrinsic feedback. In this same example,
[00:55:48] extrinsic feedback would be a marksman stripping structure, marksman stripping structure identifying
[00:55:52] their error in the two the Marine, then demonstrating the proper trigger pull. Both intrinsic
[00:55:57] and extrinsic feedback are important for learning and developing adaptability. Adaptability is
[00:56:02] the quality of being able to adjust the new conditions. Marine's develop adaptability when they
[00:56:06] examine a situation, recognize what is happening and adjust their response to the new conditions.
[00:56:11] The process of learning is itself a form of adaptive behavior and is essential element of combat
[00:56:19] effectiveness.
[00:56:20] Check. The final principle is that learning is purpose-driven to develop professional
[00:56:34] competence. Learning has specific goals and measurable objectives to gauge progress toward
[00:56:40] developing competencies. Marine learning is team-oriented so that Marines develop the skills and
[00:56:47] connections to fight collectively. Additionally, Marine's study history and world events to be
[00:56:56] more prepared to respond to new challenges such as the increase in globalization and competition
[00:57:01] for resources. Effective war fighters adapt to fluid changes in circumstances in order to deal
[00:57:06] with complex problems and to proactively shape events for advantage.
[00:57:10] Marine sometimes conceptualize the enemy and or adversary as a single person or group of people,
[00:57:18] but should be viewed as a complex system.
[00:57:28] Obviously, Marine study history and world events and that's one of the most awesome things that
[00:57:36] happens to me when I travel and meet Marines around the country and around the world is
[00:57:43] a lot of Marines listen to this podcast so that they have a better understanding of war
[00:57:47] in context of history. By listening, they're fulfilling, at least in some part,
[00:57:55] fulfilling this and what's really cool is when someone sends me a picture of 12 books from the podcast
[00:58:04] that they ordered in red and now they haven't even more in depth knowledge of things.
[00:58:11] There's a lot in here, man. This idea of adapting to fluid changes in circumstances in order
[00:58:18] to deal with complex problems and proactively shape events for an advantage.
[00:58:23] That's the core of every question we've been asked at echelon front for the last month.
[00:58:27] In this complex fluid environment that nobody anticipated and nobody expected to happen
[00:58:32] and what are they going to do to proactively shape the outcome rather than just be a victim of it
[00:58:38] on how this thing plays out. What do I need to do to shape the outcome? What do I need to take control of?
[00:58:44] And if you don't have a long history of learning how to deal with these type of settings,
[00:58:47] you're going to have a really hard time. And it's nice to bring that word shape in as opposed to
[00:58:54] what can I do to control the outcome? Because that's what you can't control the outcome.
[00:58:57] The outcome is going to come. How can you shape it?
[00:59:02] The teacher's advantage. Absolutely.
[00:59:05] Next section, the human dimension and science of learning.
[00:59:10] Conflict is a human phenomena. Understanding human nature helps Marines to understand conflict.
[00:59:18] Marine's prepare for the complexities of each conflict by studying social, economic,
[00:59:27] political, cultural, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors.
[00:59:32] You got to know human beings. How many times have I said that on this podcast? Echo Charles.
[00:59:36] I want a number. 86, something.
[00:59:39] 70,000.
[00:59:40] Thanks.
[00:59:41] These factors often exert a greater influence on this character and outcome of war.
[00:59:48] Then do factors such as the size of the enemy formations and their equipment.
[00:59:54] To all these things, human nature has a bigger influence.
[00:59:58] Oftentimes, then the size of the enemy formations or their equipment.
[01:00:02] We're talking about just human nature. And that's why leadership is always the most important thing.
[01:00:06] Leadership is a human endeavor.
[01:00:08] You can have the best and the most equipment in the world. And if you have bad leadership, if you don't
[01:00:12] understand your people, you're going to lose. You're going to lose against the person
[01:00:17] who is better-led and better understands a human components that you're dealing with.
[01:00:20] That's really the comment you made earlier. Those are human things.
[01:00:23] Yeah, I even wrote that down. Leadership is also a human endeavor.
[01:00:30] Marine's, go.
[01:00:31] As is a able wrote down, this is huge and underlying that.
[01:00:38] Marines learn as much as possible about the different human factors, cultures, perspectives,
[01:00:43] and ideas that impact operations, developing self-awareness of the personal factors that can
[01:00:47] detract from learning, such as hubris, ego, bias, enables Marines to overcome friction.
[01:00:54] Marine strived to view situations in information objectively and unemotionally,
[01:00:58] provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate factors that negatively
[01:01:03] impact preparedness.
[01:01:08] Yes, yes, and yes.
[01:01:10] Yes, ego, bias, bring us down.
[01:01:24] Marine strived to view situations in information objectively and unemotionally,
[01:01:30] and provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate factors that negatively
[01:01:37] impact preparedness. Reason I'm rehashing that one is because sometimes people utilize the candid
[01:01:45] feedback thing, but they forget about ego and hubris of the other person.
[01:01:52] So when I'm just going to give you some candid feedback, there are echo trials.
[01:01:57] When I forget about is that you have an ego.
[01:02:00] And so by giving you this candid feedback that you're not really prepared to receive,
[01:02:03] you're going to get defensive, the whole nine yards, you're not going to make any changes.
[01:02:08] Whereas if I can find a way to use maneuver or fair around that ego and provide you with feedback
[01:02:14] that somehow comes from your own brain because a seed's been planted by me, it's going to be better off.
[01:02:22] Throw a little bone to the Marine Corps on that one.
[01:02:25] Just take your thought process a little bit further on that one.
[01:02:29] Yes, Dave, little bit more. Just can we go a little bit? Can we apply what we're talking about
[01:02:35] just a little bit more and be a little bit better? Candid feedback is awesome. When
[01:02:46] there is this level of relationships and then ego, ego has been put in check, it works.
[01:02:54] And then we strive for that. It's hard to achieve. Unemotional, unemotional, candid feedback.
[01:03:01] Because how many people do you know really are geared to absorb candid feedback in an unemotional manner,
[01:03:09] especially after something like preparation for the theater?
[01:03:12] What I wrote about that later, subtracted the entire kick. I tried to help the person on the receiving end.
[01:03:19] I'm like, listen, when somebody gives you criticism, even if it's coming from someone
[01:03:23] that you think has no business giving you any feedback whatsoever, listen to them.
[01:03:30] And absorb what they say and see if you can apply it to make yourself better.
[01:03:34] And that right there, that little learning to do that as a human being. If you could learn to do that,
[01:03:39] as a human being, your life is going to be a thousand times better than it would if you never get
[01:03:44] over that hump of a, I don't like this guy, so I'm not going to listen what he has to say.
[01:03:48] Where is someone that just opened? This is you know what? And this is to your point, Dave,
[01:03:52] how many people have I met in my entire life? That were just, oh, hit me with some more candid
[01:04:00] feedback so I can just get better. Do they exist? Sure, do we get to a point? Do do sometimes people,
[01:04:08] you know, I have a relationship with someone or go, you know, someone I was putting someone
[01:04:12] through training, I could just tell like, I'm saying something, they're going to have their
[01:04:14] know, but if you're like, hey, I got it, you know, that's a great point. Thank you. Sure, if that happens,
[01:04:18] for sure, it doesn't happen all the time. It doesn't happen most of the time. Does it say
[01:04:25] unimotional candid feedback? Yes, it's a, it says, Marine strive to view situations and information
[01:04:31] objectively and unimotionally provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate
[01:04:36] factors that negatively impact preparedness. Yeah, so I guess overall, it's provide and accept
[01:04:43] any emotional. So even the unimotional kind of feedback that might, that, um, so you know how
[01:04:50] in a typical situation, I don't know, typical, what I don't even know what that even means, but
[01:04:54] a situation where you're like, hey, candid feedback in the guy kind of takes it as the, as the,
[01:05:00] the golden past to just just basically hit him as hard as he can, like, yeah, this method was straight
[01:05:06] up dog shit, you know, like that's not unimotional. That's emotional feedback right there,
[01:05:11] seem saying, like it's on the other side, it's on the negative emotion rather than, oh, you know,
[01:05:15] you could have done better, you know, it's, I mean, maybe it's candid, but you're right,
[01:05:19] and so I'm going to take this one more, one more step for the next release of this.
[01:05:24] We're going to talk about this. The reason when they revise this, when we talk about candid
[01:05:30] feedback, we also need to talk about human nature, right? Because human nature is, I bristle at
[01:05:36] candid feedback. And like I said, are there people that don't, and the goal here, the ideal goal is,
[01:05:42] like, hey, I'm a Marine, you're a Marine. I'm going to give you some candid feedback, you're going
[01:05:44] to take it on board, we're going to move forward. I get it, man, I love that. I wish that the way the
[01:05:48] world works. We have to remember human nature. We have to remember that human nature
[01:05:55] provides a level of resistance against candid feedback. I'm sorry. Yeah, and they, and they,
[01:06:01] they touch on it. They kind of talk about it a little bit, but they don't really get to the
[01:06:04] core of here is the real barrier you're going to get when you're dealing with this. Now, the good
[01:06:08] news is that anybody listening to this podcast is already listening to the previous podcast,
[01:06:12] and if you're going to be an Emily Qualified Human, the way you're going to deal with this,
[01:06:15] when they're talking about viewing feedback objectively and unemotionally, the real scenario
[01:06:20] is, I'm in charge of this mission. I built the plan, this is all the stuff that I'm, I'm the leader
[01:06:25] that I come back and then Jacob and my instructor comes back and destroys what, give me feedback.
[01:06:31] Now, what he should be able to do is tell me all these things and make go dude, those are all
[01:06:35] really good points. I'm going to incorporate all those in the next mission brief. I'm going to build
[01:06:38] this into my plan next time. We're going to go get better. But what I do is I come show up ready for that
[01:06:43] feedback to defend what I did because that was my plan. I was the mission commander and I can't be
[01:06:48] unemotional and detached, but I should be. So if you're listening to this, your job is to take
[01:06:53] all the feedback you get even from the people that you cannot stand in an unemotional, an objective
[01:06:59] fashion. We got a question just last week, what do I do with the perennial complainer on my team
[01:07:04] that is constantly complaining about everything? You know what the answer is? Listen to him.
[01:07:10] Because it might actually have some feedback for you. The problem isn't the
[01:07:13] he's a perennial complainer or the problem that you don't want to hear him. But the almost exact
[01:07:16] opportunity to choose when you were providing feedback, if you go in with the assumption that
[01:07:21] that person will be just like you and unemotional and prepared, you're also going to be ineffective
[01:07:27] that you have to make the exact opposite approach, which is you're going to be dealing with nothing
[01:07:32] but their ego. And you know if it turns out that I'm debriefing Jaco and he's totally in the game
[01:07:37] than that's then we're good. And we represent, I don't know, 5% or 10% of the interactions
[01:07:44] if you're lucky that you're going to get. But over time, if you actually take people see you as
[01:07:50] a leader, taking other people's feedback when they appear to be not credible and not good
[01:07:55] people take feedback from and you're willing to listen to them, you actually can influence other
[01:07:59] people doing that. Takes time. What they don't talk about and here is when you decide to go do that,
[01:08:04] here's all the barriers are going to be in place with this plan of hey man, I'm just going to come
[01:08:08] to the front door of Jaco and give you some candid feedback. You're just going to take it and it's
[01:08:11] going to go again. Look, look, Marine Corps, we get the ideal. I would love, I would love if that
[01:08:18] was the way the world works. Unfortunately, we have to deal with human nature. That's what we have to
[01:08:23] deal with. Just like after the other thing combat, you have to deal deal with it in a debrief.
[01:08:28] So be ready for it. Control what you can control. Learn from it.
[01:08:35] Alright, violence and danger will always be parts of war, learning to fight in dangerous conditions
[01:08:41] despite fear and uncertainty is key to war fighting. Marines of all ranks must understand how
[01:08:45] the body and mind respond to fear and stress so that they better control the responses in any
[01:08:51] situation, including combat. Marines learn how to effectively control stress reactions and fight
[01:08:56] dangerous conditions through realistic training, increasing self awareness, understanding the attributes
[01:09:01] of war, and increasing mental and physical resilience. For example, Marines learn breathing techniques
[01:09:07] during marksmanship training to better control how the body's nervous system response
[01:09:11] to stress in order to shoot more accurately. The breathing techniques help Marines
[01:09:16] to control their heart rate, respiration, attention and muscular stress and muscles under stress,
[01:09:21] which then increases the accuracy of fire. Combat can challenge,
[01:09:26] unique cohesion and present Marines with a variety of moral and ethical dilemmas.
[01:09:30] Marines develop strong mental, moral, spiritual and ethical understanding because they are as
[01:09:35] important as physical skills when operating in the violence of combat.
[01:09:40] And it's interesting too, I thought they were going to make this connection and maybe I forgot
[01:09:48] maybe they make it later, but I don't think they do. But you and I made it on the last podcast
[01:09:52] talking about the code book. The breathing techniques help Marines control their heart rate
[01:09:58] respiration, attention, muscles under stress and then increase their accuracy of their fire.
[01:10:03] That's cool. It doesn't only apply to shooting your rifle. It applies to everything that you're
[01:10:08] going to do, whether you're dealing with somebody that's combative and you got to put hands on them,
[01:10:12] whether you're dealing with your boss at yelling with at you or whether you're dealing with
[01:10:15] your six-year-old kid that just threw a temper tantrum. All those things can come into play.
[01:10:24] The science of learning encompasses many disciplines such as neuroscience, psychology,
[01:10:29] and androgology, which is adult learning. The human brain is a constantly reorganizing system
[01:10:37] capable of being shaped and reshaped across an entire lifespan. Each new learning event impacts
[01:10:43] the brain regardless of the Marines age, rank, or level of experience. Therefore, Marines should
[01:10:48] understand that challenging experiences enhance the brain and better hone their warfighting
[01:10:54] capability. Science is also identified that individuals and teams have differences in the way they
[01:10:59] learn with varying sensory preferences for learning competencies and strengths. So that's something
[01:11:06] you hear about. You know, people learn in different ways, but the science before that one
[01:11:12] challenging experiences enhance the brain and better hone their warfighting capability. We want
[01:11:19] to do things that are hard. We need to do things that are hard. Adult learning involves adapting
[01:11:27] or modifying the prior relevant information to specific situation or problem that the Marines seek
[01:11:33] to resolve. You're taking what you know and applying it to new situations. And effective way
[01:11:41] that Marines can accelerate their learning is by indirectly learning from others through
[01:11:45] vicarious experience. By garyous experiences, our relevant learning opportunities that each
[01:11:51] marine obtains by observing, reading and studying what others have experienced. There is no
[01:11:55] excuse for not learning from others. Each Marine must learn how to learn both independently and
[01:12:05] collectively in teams. Social and interpersonal factors such as effective communication group
[01:12:11] cohesion and trust all influence learning. I'm going to read that one again. Social and interpersonal
[01:12:18] factors such as effective communication group cohesion and trust all influence learning. When these
[01:12:23] factors are positive, they facilitate learning process, facilitate the learning process and create
[01:12:28] strong relationships. This is the thing that I've gone over a bunch of times recently. It was like,
[01:12:31] hey, why was I able to like rip apart a young lieutenant in a debrief? It's because he trusted
[01:12:40] me and we had we had that the strong relationship and therefore I can say I can get candid.
[01:12:49] That's why I caught myself in the last example. I was given this example where you're going to
[01:12:52] come in and rip apart my debrief and I caught myself. I'm like, oh, I'm actually going on the
[01:12:56] assumption when I say that that we have such a good relationship that I realize that what you're
[01:13:00] doing is actually trying to help me as opposed to coming in there and being a tyrant to tear my
[01:13:04] plan apart was because of exactly that when the when the environment is positive, you can come in
[01:13:10] and you can rip that thing to shreds as you need to to shreds and all of it is for me to get better.
[01:13:18] I look at every single thing and it said to go, man, I really wish you could kind of be nicer when
[01:13:21] you say that. I mean, think about that. I just look for the things that you're saying which actually
[01:13:26] is a massive time saver and allows you to be more effective and more efficient because you're not
[01:13:30] worried about those other things but like you said before the problem with that is you can't take
[01:13:34] that for granted that that's actually really really hard to get and a lot of those people are like,
[01:13:39] hey, I'm just trying to help you out, man. I'm just trying to help you here. But if they don't hear you,
[01:13:46] it doesn't matter. You're not effective. Yeah. And the efficiency thing again, I've been talking
[01:13:50] about this lately. It's like the efficiency thing of like, well, look, wouldn't it just be easier?
[01:13:54] If I could just tell Dave, hey, Dave, here's where you screwed up and that brief and you did these
[01:13:58] three things wrong. That's obvious. Yeah. Yeah. More efficient. And I'm a matter of fact kind of guy
[01:14:03] and people's just kind of get on board and like, it would be more efficient if Dave listened to
[01:14:09] anything I said. If he made any adjustment, but the problem is he doesn't adjust anything. He just
[01:14:12] puts up his defenses and so it's efficient in delivery. It's completely inefficient in
[01:14:19] absorption. Totally. Doesn't work. It's not effective. Period.
[01:14:23] Marine should actively seek to understand human and environmental factors that influence learning
[01:14:27] while avoiding thoughts and behaviors that can negatively affect learning and cohesion.
[01:14:34] Next section, problem solving is a warfighting capability. Time spent learning how to effectively
[01:14:40] think and solve problems as time well invested. Marines must build the skills to recognize potential
[01:14:45] problems, reason and critically and think critically. Reasoning is the process of thinking about
[01:14:52] something in a logical way to form a conclusion or judgment. Critical thinking is the reflective
[01:14:57] part of that reasoning. Critical thinking skills include inference, evaluation, interpretation and
[01:15:04] explanation. Developing these skills enables Marines to understand not only the information presented,
[01:15:10] but also its potential implications and secondary effects. And this is one of those things where
[01:15:16] when you are, when you're in a leadership position, being able to do this quickly,
[01:15:20] being able to look at like a problem in a solution and two or three solutions and being able to figure
[01:15:24] out what's going to happen if I imply this one, this one, and see, hey, this one will solve it quick,
[01:15:28] but I got that I'm going to deal with this giant mess that I just created. Cool. I'm going to
[01:15:32] option B. That's the difference between the white belt, the blue belt, leader. The blue belt
[01:15:38] leader is like, okay, I see the immediate solution that I could do, but I see that after effects are
[01:15:43] worse, so I'm going to plan B. Yeah. Through reasoning and critical thinking, Marines explore
[01:15:50] question and understand the key factors affecting the situation which then enables Marines to
[01:15:55] develop better courses of action. And again, the more experience you have doing this,
[01:16:00] the quicker you'll be able to recognize the patterns of these things and you're sitting at
[01:16:05] think is, you know, from a leadership perspective, you know, you and I and rest of the guys in
[01:16:10] Estolome front working with companies, it's a classic example of, well, hey, we've got this problem here's
[01:16:17] how I'm going to solve it. And we all look at that problem ago. Okay, I see what you're saying. And I see
[01:16:25] that that seems like the direct, most direct efficient way to solve this problem. Here's the nine
[01:16:29] after effects that are going to make this just a complete gut check. Yeah, because you're not thinking
[01:16:34] through, you know, you, well, as a white belt leader, you're not seeing this or as an emotional leader or
[01:16:40] whatever. It's skipping ahead a little bit, quickly recognizing and addressing potential problems
[01:16:48] enables Marines to better deal with disruption and respond to changes in the enemy situation.
[01:16:54] Again, pattern recognition, responding to those problems, the future battle space will contain
[01:17:04] increasingly difficult problems that do not necessarily have a right answer.
[01:17:11] Therefore, Marines skills to observe objectively, reasonably, reasonably, and take decisive
[01:17:17] action and then adjust as needed remain key elements of success.
[01:17:24] I mean, that's that's right out of what you talk about the inter-v decision making. And it's,
[01:17:29] it's not just action. It's still decisive action, default to aggressive action, but just far enough
[01:17:34] for you to figure out and get the feedback of, do I need to keep going, do I need maneuver, do I need
[01:17:38] to back up? And the connection of those two, which is decisive action, and then adjust as needed.
[01:17:44] That, that is the connection that is so hard that people don't, don't make some times.
[01:17:50] Get that feedback loop going. Get that feedback. I like the, I'm not right answer. I remember
[01:17:54] hearing about the German war problems, war game problems that the only solution that would work
[01:18:02] or the only options that would work were not, you know, you were told not to do. So, hey,
[01:18:08] don't go past this limit of advance. The only way you're going to get out, this is go past
[01:18:12] that limit of advance. So, they're trying to get the Germans who have a propensity to follow rules.
[01:18:20] And so, they're trying to get them, hey, here's the rule. We, in order to get this done,
[01:18:24] you're going to need to break this rule. What are you going to do? But they don't tell them that. They
[01:18:27] just watch them and they just see them said the limit of advance and get killed in the scenario.
[01:18:38] The mind as a weapon. The philosophy of maneuver warfare guides much of what Marines do.
[01:18:45] And that right there is like, let's just have a podcast about that. In fact, I guess we do have
[01:18:52] a podcast about that, this podcast. So, the philosophy of maneuver warfare guides much of what Marines do.
[01:18:57] It is their way of thinking about and preparing for war with the intended purpose of taking
[01:19:02] decisive action against the enemy at the least cost themselves. By the way, this is maneuver warfare
[01:19:09] is the reason I kind of, as a younger leader in the teams, the reason I started to grasp onto it and
[01:19:16] understand it was because of judici. Because what's judici is, it's maneuver warfare. That's all it is.
[01:19:21] It's maneuver warfare. It's decisive action against the enemy with the least cost to yourself. That's
[01:19:25] what you're just who is. Marine study and apply maneuver warfare in order to better exploit
[01:19:31] advantages and multiple domains and create rapidly unfolding situations in the battle that
[01:19:36] overwhelm the enemy. maneuver warfare requires that Marines develop that to, oh, by the way,
[01:19:41] also that what I just read judici is to, right, create rapidly unfolding end situations that overwhelm the
[01:19:48] enemy like, oh, I'm across, oh, I'm moving here. I, I, I, I, I did your call.
[01:19:54] Minuver warfare requires that Marines develop the temperant to preserve, persevere amidst uncertainty
[01:19:59] and the mental agility to succeed in fluid and chaotic situations. Additionally, it requires
[01:20:04] being able to understand the dynamic and complex situation from multiple perspectives to determine
[01:20:11] how to exploit an advantage. Decentralized execution within the commanders intent is central
[01:20:19] to maneuver warfare. This requires that each Marine understand the situation and execute actions
[01:20:25] to support and achieve that intent. So, Decentralized command. That's why, regardless of technology
[01:20:39] and equipment, Marines are ready to fight and win. Therefore, it is essential that Marines
[01:20:43] develop and maintain an intellectual edge over any enemy by developing their minds.
[01:20:49] Just as they would prepare any other weapon system for battle. This intellectual edge must come from
[01:20:57] self-discipline study and deliberate practice as Marines
[01:21:01] to build competencies in the profession of arms as individuals, teams, units and magtafs.
[01:21:11] Once again, they're, they're, they're talking about self-discipline, they're kind of highlighting
[01:21:19] that that's what we're talking about. The last part, I think it's the last part of this section.
[01:21:28] Continuous learners developing the mind as a weapon is a career-long process.
[01:21:34] Marines are continuous learners. They pursue mastery in the profession of arms
[01:21:39] recognizing that the achievement of mastery is a journey not a destination.
[01:21:44] As adult learners, Marines recognize that they are responsible for their own learning,
[01:21:48] outcomes, actions, and decisions. As adult learners, Marines need to know why content is relevant
[01:21:55] during both training and educational activities. Marines perceive learning as a progression of
[01:22:00] goals to build competencies not a single discrete goal. Hence the analogy of the armbar in one room,
[01:22:09] the triangle and the other room. No, it's all together. It's not a single goal. It's all together.
[01:22:14] Therefore, Marines benefit most from information and learning activities presented in the context
[01:22:19] of real-life situations or task-specific problems. To become better warfighters, Marines continuously
[01:22:29] gather information and engage in activities that test their assumptions, develop new knowledge,
[01:22:34] increase critical thinking and reasoning, and build deeper understanding. Instead of simply asking
[01:22:39] what happened in a battle, Marines should always ask and seek to better understand why the events
[01:22:47] happened and consequently what to apply for for future situations. Marines must learn about a broad
[01:22:53] range of topics and skills through professional reading, experience, experience, learning, and deliberate
[01:22:58] practice. Marines must also approach each event and interaction as a learning opportunity. There is no,
[01:23:04] there is always something to learn even if that's something is what not to do in the future.
[01:23:09] As continuous learners, Marines actively seek apply and share lessons learned to develop
[01:23:14] themselves and other Marines in the profession of arms. It's interesting that in the
[01:23:25] in the EQH book, in the evaluation in the code, we've got this whole section on improving your
[01:23:31] mental capability and how that's so important. That's the same thing that the Marines are saying here,
[01:23:37] conclusion to this first section, they say, Marines adapt to every tool that they have weapons,
[01:23:44] equipment, and their minds to succeed in winning every climb in place. Marines must develop and
[01:23:49] demonstrate brilliance in the basic fundamental skills combined with the mental agility to adapt to
[01:23:55] whatever situation they face. Say that again, Marines must develop and demonstrate brilliance
[01:24:01] in the basic fundamental skills combined with the mental agility to adapt to whatever
[01:24:09] situation they face. So different from that stereotypical vision of a Marine that you are just going to
[01:24:21] obey orders, do as you're told. Follow orders or people die. Oh there you go, a few good men.
[01:24:28] Speaking of quotes. All right, so that wraps up the first chapter. Right now, I'm
[01:24:38] assessing that we're only going to make it through two chapters of this thing. So we'll do one more
[01:24:42] chapter right now and then we'll save the next one for the next podcast. Chapter two, the culture
[01:24:49] of learning starts off with the quote, humility and gender is learning because it beats back the
[01:24:55] arrogance that puts blinders on. It leaves you open for truth to reveal themselves. You don't
[01:25:03] stand in your own way. Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly humble? I believe there's
[01:25:11] one simple test because they consistently observe and listen the humble improve. Because they
[01:25:21] consistently observe and listen the humble improve. They don't assume I know the way.
[01:25:28] And who's that a quote from? Winton Morsealis. Jazz musician, trumpet player. Interesting, right?
[01:25:43] It's history that the United States Marine courts are a trumpet jazz playing musician,
[01:25:48] but his quote on humility is, it's interesting. If we hadn't written extreme ownership with a
[01:26:04] chapter called Czechy Rigo and stay humble, it's like, I'd be thinking about doing that right now.
[01:26:10] There are no secrets to success. There's a result of preparation, hard work and learning from
[01:26:14] failure. That's Colin Powell. And thanks to my reading, I have never been caught flat-footed by any
[01:26:21] situation, never at a loss for how any problem has been addressed successfully or unsuccessfully before.
[01:26:28] It doesn't give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead, and that is
[01:26:34] general matters. So ideas and methods can have more significant impact on warfighting than weapon
[01:26:42] systems, technology or organizational structures. This speaking of music, right?
[01:26:52] The guitar, the guitar technology that you have, the music school that you went through,
[01:26:59] none of that can compare to like good ideas. This is an underrated, an underrated
[01:27:07] grid, thought that I have. I always talk about this. I say listen, you can go to a guitar center
[01:27:16] and you can put a sign up and you can say, hey, if you can play these songs, you can pick
[01:27:21] most technical songs you know. Most underrated analogy, you can pick the most technical songs
[01:27:27] you'd say, if you can play these songs, contact me immediately. I'll give you whatever,
[01:27:32] I'll put you on this record. And you'll get hundreds of people that will be like, I can play
[01:27:37] all those songs, no for no, I got them. But all those people can't make a hit song.
[01:27:43] Because they don't have the creative, they don't have the ideas in their head.
[01:27:49] So they're saying the same thing here, no, no matter what your guitar is, no matter what technology you have,
[01:27:54] your ideas can have more significant impact on warfighting than any of those things. So the
[01:27:59] Marine Corps, learning culture, fosters the attributes that every Marine needs to pursue, such as
[01:28:05] adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, active listening and bias for action. You know,
[01:28:12] there's some, there's some horses that get beat real hard in this book. Like they get beat.
[01:28:18] One of them is bias for action. You gotta remember, we're not covered in the whole book right now.
[01:28:22] I mean, I'm skipping chunks and bias for actions all throughout this book.
[01:28:25] What did I call that? Next-stream ownership? Default the aggressive.
[01:28:33] That's got to be your default mode. Organizational culture.
[01:28:38] The Marine Corps culture values action. Again, there's that horse getting another crack in the jaw.
[01:28:45] Responsibility, ownership, adaptability and problem solving. Therefore, the Marines learning process
[01:28:51] and culture develop and exercise these values. Oh, and I've got a little note here.
[01:29:03] And this is just like the way that the Marines roll. So listen to this sentence. Listen to these
[01:29:09] two sentences. The Marine Corps culture values action, responsibility, adaptability and problem
[01:29:14] solving. Therefore, Marines learning processes and culture develop and exercise these values.
[01:29:19] What's cool about the Marine Corps is they're not saying this is what the Marine Corps should aspire to
[01:29:25] or this is what the Marine Corps should do. They say there was the Marine Corps does. Like it's not even
[01:29:31] it's not even a question. That's what the Marine Corps does. The Marine Corps hierarchical command structure
[01:29:37] and process may at times be perceived as an obstacle to adaptability and learning. Although both
[01:29:43] are essential for the proper exercise of command and control, Marines must ensure that they do not
[01:29:50] set conditions for unintended negative effects on learning that could negatively impact
[01:29:55] war fighting such as discouraging Marines initiative feedback or problem solving. Huge, huge. What
[01:30:03] happens when the dichotomy of chain of command goes too far? Now we have people that aren't giving
[01:30:08] feedback anymore. So we need to make sure it doesn't set those conditions. Again, it's important
[01:30:17] that we think about learning. We're thinking about it from the perspective of learning what the
[01:30:24] enemy is doing and it's how I'm going to defeat the enemy. It's not like it affects not like negative
[01:30:29] effect on learning the proper technique for cleaning this weapon. We're talking about learning how to beat
[01:30:36] the enemy actively while that fight is happening. Skip and handle a little bit. Leaders at all levels
[01:30:47] are charged with creating an environment where continuous learning becomes the standard. Leaders serve
[01:30:52] as positive examples of a disciplined approach to learning while also providing their Marines with
[01:30:58] constructive feedback. Leaders of Marines must dedicate time and effort to learning and prioritize
[01:31:06] mental fitness as much as physical fitness. Dang. Dang. You know what? One of my next missions
[01:31:17] and I guess we're kind of what we might be on it. It's probably going on right now, right? But
[01:31:23] systematic learning. Again, it's kind of goes back like the idea of the thread. You should be able
[01:31:30] to just pick up and learn things in a cohesive manner. And there's, and I get that there's
[01:31:36] there's some part of learning things in a non cohesive manner that forces you to learn how to
[01:31:41] put them into a cohesive manner. So there's something to that and I get it. But you should be
[01:31:47] able to at least take different subjects and get them close enough to each other so that people can
[01:31:52] easily make those connections. And then maybe you learn how to spread those things about
[01:31:57] a part of a little further. So people have to think even more to get those connections to come.
[01:32:02] But we make it so hard to learn so many different subjects that we just don't connect. We don't
[01:32:10] bring any cohesion to. We don't act. We act as if science history, literature, poetry, art. We
[01:32:20] act as if they're these separate things. And they're not. And the better you understand each one of
[01:32:27] those things and then the better you understand how they fit together, the better you understand
[01:32:30] them all, and the better you understand them all, the better you understand human nature and people.
[01:32:34] The better you understand people, the better you can take all this, all the things that you
[01:32:39] deal with in life and put them into context and do something and shape the outcome of your life.
[01:32:53] So we need to prioritize mental fitness. And again, it's interesting. We wrote the code and
[01:33:01] evaluation in the protocols before this book came out. But we made number one, the number one thing
[01:33:07] you need to take care of as physical fitness and number two is mental fitness. And the reason we
[01:33:15] prioritize them like that is because if you don't have a body, you don't have a mind.
[01:33:21] I don't think anyone can argue with that. Continuing on, integrating learning activities
[01:33:28] into physical training events when Marines are both mentally and physically challenged,
[01:33:31] encourages deep learning and facilitates the recall of lessons learned during combat situations.
[01:33:41] Awesome. As part of the learning experience, leaders must foster an environment that
[01:33:47] appropriately tolerates mistakes, errors, and challenges to existing ideas. Challenging ideas and
[01:33:55] making mistakes are part of the learning process. Boom. Challenging ideas and making mistakes are
[01:34:04] part of the learning process. If you're not encouraging your subordinates to challenge your ideas,
[01:34:11] I mean, I love it when people challenge my ideas. It actually, I love it. I love it.
[01:34:19] And it's not because I want to, it's not because I have an opportunity to like beat them or show
[01:34:24] them that I know what's up. I like it because I know I'm going to learn something. I'll learn from
[01:34:30] their challenge. Their challenge is going to either break through my position and I'm going to
[01:34:35] realize that they're right or it's going to make me patch a hole in my position that was a
[01:34:40] vulnerability that now we can utilize this idea and it's going to be stronger. Challenging
[01:34:51] ideas in a respectful and constructive way contributes to improve learning for both subordinates and
[01:34:55] leaders. They threw that in there thankfully. Yeah. Yes. And in leadership strategy and tactics,
[01:35:02] I actually tell you how to save these words correctly because it's not easy. Yeah, like, I like to
[01:35:11] speak the truth. I'm a straight shooter. I'm going to come right at you and like, hey,
[01:35:15] let's just how I am. So I'm going to challenge you my boss in a way that totally undermines the
[01:35:21] relationship we have. And I just tell you how screwed up you are now wrong. And you're the
[01:35:25] problem because you won't listen to me. That's going to work out. That's not going to work out. That's
[01:35:28] right. Yeah. But I'm the guy that speaks the truth. You know, bosses who want to hear it. People don't
[01:35:34] like that. Yeah. Boss just doesn't want to hear it. You can't handle the truth. There we go in there.
[01:35:39] Leaders should permit ideas to be challenged in discussion and planning up to the point where
[01:35:45] the leader makes decision. Leaders should not automatically interpret a subordinate,
[01:35:51] challenging an idea or providing feedback as challenging their authority. Chitching. Yeah.
[01:35:57] So they cover it both. Nope. You need a challenge it in a respectful way. And oh, by the way,
[01:36:00] you need to listen to it as if it's not an attacking earth or a go. But I said in the leaders
[01:36:06] of strategy and tactics, people usually think their idea is the best idea. It's just, it's just
[01:36:12] kind of the way it is. Totally. And you know what? You can actually program yourself to not be that
[01:36:17] way. And I think I've done a pretty good job with that. Actually, I usually think like, okay, my
[01:36:21] idea is out there, but it's not necessarily right. And I'm, I want to hear other people's ideas.
[01:36:28] You can totally train to that. You can totally teach yourself to do that. And the thing that makes
[01:36:33] that easier over time is you actually start to win more. Oh, yeah. Life gets better. Like,
[01:36:37] oh, this was a really big, a big stretch from my ego to start to tolerate that. I'm like, oh,
[01:36:41] oh, my life is 100 times better now than it was. This isn't that hard. Hey, you got feedback from me?
[01:36:45] Dude, bring it on. Yeah. Because I bet you my life gets better if I listen to your feedback.
[01:36:51] The leaders authority gives him or her the responsibility to make decisions, but does not mean that
[01:36:56] the leaders have to develop all the ideas themselves. Leaders should try to do the
[01:37:00] intoxics. We're. By the way, yeah, whoever authored this thing, the legit, nicely done,
[01:37:07] I appreciate the appreciated.
[01:37:12] Subordinates need to be willing to admit mistakes, ask questions and seek corrective feedback.
[01:37:18] Naturally, a subordinate, a subordinates willingness to admit mistakes depends on the
[01:37:23] commanders willingness to tolerate them. And what's good about that, well, I would, you know, a
[01:37:30] little adjustment there are subordinates willingness to admit mistakes, but also a subordinates willingness
[01:37:35] to make mistakes or take risks that will result in mistakes depends on the commanders
[01:37:40] are willing to tolerate. So if you got a person that never tolerates any mistakes, guess what?
[01:37:44] No one's going to do anything for them.
[01:37:45] That's like one of the major criticisms of like the traditional educational process.
[01:37:54] That the low tolerance from mistakes. So like you take a quiz, it's probably different now.
[01:37:58] I don't know. I've been a long time since I've been high school, but you know when you take a test
[01:38:02] or a quiz, right? Say you have 10 questions, right? You get five of them wrong. That's a F.
[01:38:09] Straight up F. 50. Oh yeah. So let's say you have four quizzes through the course of the year.
[01:38:17] If you've got to F that, it factors into your final grade. No matter if you got those questions right
[01:38:21] later or not, you could learn 100% of the material perfectly, but if you've got to F on one of
[01:38:26] those quizzes, your grade might not be 100%. So if you make a mistake, even if you correct the
[01:38:32] mistake, you still do punish for it. Seems saying you could know the correct answer to the
[01:38:37] mistake that you made thoroughly through and through, you still get punished. I see your point.
[01:38:43] However, I think there's other things that are being trained, right? Like you need to prepare and
[01:38:49] study and be ready, right? Yeah. And life doesn't always give you a second third fourth chance
[01:38:55] to square yourself away from your 50. Yeah, but maybe that's what's high school is for, maybe not.
[01:39:03] But so I guess you're arguing. What I don't like about what I just said is that
[01:39:11] I'm clearly thinking of it from like a well, I actually don't, not that I don't like what I just said.
[01:39:17] Well, you could you could argue well, hey, Jocos, you just want people learning and studying
[01:39:20] for grades to get an A on a grade. And that's not that that's not what I want. But there is a fact
[01:39:26] of when you go to school, you're learning. Okay, I got to do certain things. I got to do certain
[01:39:31] things I don't want to do and I got to do them on time. Yeah. Those are important lessons to learn.
[01:39:35] Yeah, about life. Yeah. So what you're, unless you want to throw it at me that school is
[01:39:39] develops that we could break children mentally and train them to be factory workers, which is also
[01:39:46] true. That is one of the criticisms or the reason for that, you know, that whole, you know what I actually
[01:39:52] picked up on right now. It's nothing new, really. What you just did, you just responded to that.
[01:39:58] What I just said with extreme ownership, with extreme responsibility, you know, you're,
[01:40:04] I said, this is a major criticism of the school system and you essentially said in so many words,
[01:40:09] hey, don't blame the school system, you take responsibility for going to school. That's essentially
[01:40:13] what you said back to me. Interesting. That's a make what I said any last true. But you, you were like,
[01:40:19] okay, cool, you know, so what are you going to do about it kind of thing? Yeah, you better, you know,
[01:40:23] you better study hard, you better work hard, kind of thing. Seems like. Yeah, well, and that's the point
[01:40:27] that that's the point is what are we trying to do with school, right? Is it, there's a bunch of
[01:40:31] things that are going on with school. And maybe if we clarify those things more, you could understand
[01:40:36] because do you want the person to learn education, right? Do you want them to get smarter? Do you want
[01:40:40] them to get knowledge? Yes, do you want them to learn about how to live their life? Yes.
[01:40:45] And how do you balance those things correctly? I think not to go too deep into the school system
[01:40:52] or nothing like that. But I think that saying that or feeling that like, hey, it teaches you to do
[01:40:57] this and do this on top of like the math that I'm that you're learning in the class.
[01:41:04] I think that's sort of like a like a wiggly like not excuse, but it's like they'll just throw
[01:41:11] that in as like part of the school. I guess what it needs is a clear definition of the mission of
[01:41:15] the school. Yeah, clear definition of the school. And as a high school kid or whatever you go on
[01:41:19] the class in math class, what are we learning in math class? You tell me, what are we learning in math
[01:41:23] class? Math, right? I didn't know we're going to learn all these other life lessons that
[01:41:28] no one says by the way. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So it's like okay, I did. So maybe if they clarify
[01:41:33] the mission and said, hey, this isn't isn't just about learning math. This is about learning how to
[01:41:38] operate with other people. This is learning about how to learn time management. It's one of the things
[01:41:42] you're about to learn. If you got told that, you probably be okay. I get it. That was part of the
[01:41:46] curriculum. Yeah. If you got told that because I don't know some people say that all the time,
[01:41:51] but then it's like, well, the rest of the stuff going on doesn't support what you're saying
[01:41:55] right now, but whatever. But yeah, if that was part of the curriculum, oh yeah, 100%. 100%.
[01:42:01] Check. All right. Back to the book. Marines will learn from their mistakes when they receive
[01:42:07] constructive, corrective feedback. By the way, I'll do a little additive to that statement.
[01:42:12] Marines will not learn from their mistakes if they are offended by that constructive,
[01:42:18] corrective feedback. The easiest hedge against the potential of some of your guys on your
[01:42:26] team in the Marine Corps anywhere else of having a problem with that is to actually take
[01:42:30] ownership of the mistakes they make. And I just wrote down like, hey, the ultimate form of
[01:42:35] tolerating other people's mistakes, which is really what this is about is you want to let your
[01:42:39] people make mistakes because that's actually good. It's learning. It's a way is to take response
[01:42:43] to the building for that is to when you're setting up the debrief, rather than go, hey,
[01:42:49] corporate willing. Here's 37 things you screwed up on this mission that we did as opposed to.
[01:42:55] Hey, let's talk about these things. Here's all the things that happen here. Here's all the things that
[01:43:00] I'm going to do differently next time to put you in a position to be successful. So he's actually
[01:43:04] not afraid. My boss thinks this was his mistake. So even inside this thing, this idea of,
[01:43:11] he said you tolerating your willingness to tolerate your subordinate's mistakes. Well,
[01:43:15] anybody who listens to this podcast should know that that actually shouldn't be that hard at this
[01:43:19] point because any mistake your subordinate's make is actually whose fault is that really?
[01:43:22] The machine gunners, I know we've used that example a thousand times. And if you want to
[01:43:26] breed the idea that making those mistakes is okay, there's a really easy formula to make in that
[01:43:31] happened and it'll just make them admit it more and actually come with better creative solutions to that.
[01:43:36] So they make them less over time. Yeah. And those are things, leadership strategy and tactics.
[01:43:40] I actually wrote down what to say and what not to say. Yeah. There's a person.
[01:43:45] I'm just saying this, say that. And by the way, one of the reasons that
[01:43:49] leadership strategy and tactics that I went down that road is because
[01:43:55] and I was saying this to a group the other day on EF online.
[01:43:59] And it's one of these things where it's here's the deal. I've been doing this for a long time.
[01:44:11] So when I tell someone, hey, what you need to do is take, you know, go in there and use a
[01:44:15] flanking maneuver and set them up with this and plant it an idea in your head and it'll be good.
[01:44:20] Then I have to be careful with that because I'm good at it.
[01:44:24] I'm good. I did it when I was at E5 with my particular matter. I did it when I was at
[01:44:30] the idea, I did it through the chain of things. I did it. I've done it a million times.
[01:44:33] So when some clients says, hey, how do I handle this person that is complaining, right?
[01:44:41] Or is objecting to the way we're doing things? How do I handle that?
[01:44:46] And I say, oh, you could do this. I have to say, and listen, you need to be
[01:44:50] tactful when you do it. You need to think about it from their perspective. Because sometimes
[01:44:53] people hear, oh, you need to go talk to them about it. Okay, got it. Boom, they're rolling into the
[01:44:57] office. Yeah, I need to talk to you about x, y and z. No, I didn't mean that. So that's why I like
[01:45:06] leader's strategy and tactics. Like here's how you actually say this. The machine gunner made a
[01:45:10] mistake. It's not, hey, echo, you shot outside of your field of fire. It's, hey, echo. I don't think
[01:45:17] I did a good job explaining what your field of fire was because you just got danger close to the
[01:45:21] other squad. That's my fault. You go, there you go. Boom. Next, a critical element of learning
[01:45:31] from mistakes is embracing an appropriate level of risk. Combat is inherently dangerous and
[01:45:36] risky. However, the greatest mistake in combat could be an unwillingness to act from a fear of
[01:45:43] risk or failure to adapt to the changing situation. So how do you get good at doing? How do you get
[01:45:50] good at figuring out what the appropriate level of risk is? It's by making mistakes. So if you don't
[01:45:54] make mistakes in training, when the time comes in combat and you're unwilling to even try anything,
[01:45:59] either out of fear or risk of failure or risk of getting yelled at or failure to adapt because
[01:46:03] you've never done it before. Like the time when you're a squad leader and you're like looking around
[01:46:11] and someone says, hey man, just go for it. You go for it. And you like things turn out,
[01:46:16] maybe they turn out okay, maybe they turn out bad. But either way, you go, okay, well, I kind of
[01:46:19] did it. And then you realize you know what, next time I do it, I need to do it a little bit faster,
[01:46:23] but I need to, I need to, you know, keep the squad more, more, more distance between each other.
[01:46:29] Okay, cool. You learn to do a little something. Now, next time you make an aggressive mood,
[01:46:32] you've got this little more dispersion in your squad and everyone stays alive and it's cool.
[01:46:36] Again, this is training. So that way, by the time you get in a point in combat where you need to
[01:46:42] take some initiative, you've done it before. You do not want anyone on your subordinate team
[01:46:47] to the first time they show a half to show any initiative is in a combat situation or isn't a
[01:46:52] business meeting or isn't a with a client. That's real. That's not the first time you want to see them
[01:46:57] take initiative. Have them take initiative and some control environments to kick it off.
[01:47:07] Continuing on. Therefore, Marines should only take reasonable rest during training and
[01:47:15] learn to adapt to the changing situation where the witches wanted to just say, all Marines
[01:47:19] regardless of position or rank must discuss what led to mistakes take corrective action and learn
[01:47:25] from them. You got a debrief. Learning from mistakes is key to Marines, learning to act
[01:47:29] decisively and effectively while taking prudent rescuers, everything I just said. There's a little
[01:47:35] section in here, which I've been skipping some of these sections, but I'm going to hit this one. This
[01:47:39] is a battle-bell award. Captain John W. Thomas and Juni who earned the Navy Cross during his service
[01:47:47] with first Battalion 5th Marines wrote about the fourth Marine Brigade and he says,
[01:47:52] Plotunes were formed and I'm skipping ahead of Little Bobbi says, Plotunes were formed in four
[01:47:56] waves. He goes into it talking about how they had maps and how they had a plan and how they were
[01:48:02] basically using what they had learned from the French. And so he says, Plotunes were formed in
[01:48:07] four waves, the attack formation taught by the French, a formation proved in trench warfare, where
[01:48:13] there was a short way to go and you calculated on losing the first three waves and getting the
[01:48:18] fourth one to the objective. That's what they got taught. Hey, you're going to take four waves
[01:48:26] of people, the first three, they're all going to die and the fourth one will get through. And then
[01:48:32] it says, after the first engagement, the Marines never used it again. It was a formation that's
[01:48:39] simply accepted casualties was not adapted for open warfare and left formations rushing across
[01:48:44] open ground incredibly vulnerable. It did not take the Marines long to learn better and to adapt
[01:48:51] their tactics and found it on sound basics learned during their training. There's anything else on that.
[01:49:07] I knew you were going to talk about that just because of how often you and I have talked about
[01:49:11] over one and you hit that over and over again of all the wars like that's the one you look at
[01:49:15] and I'm like, what was going on there? What was going on there from a leadership standpoint? And
[01:49:22] honestly, my favorite line is after the first engagement, the Marines never used it again.
[01:49:30] One time they looked around and like, we're not doing this anymore. And there's kind of a stunning
[01:49:35] piece on leadership of what was everybody else and they've been doing it for years when the
[01:49:39] Marines showed up. Anyway, I just knew that given how much we've talked about that comment,
[01:49:46] there was actually really important comment this they saw at once and they recognized right away.
[01:49:50] This is wrong and we need to adapt right now. You don't need to do this five, six, seven,
[01:49:54] eight, ten times to realize this is a bad, bad plan. Yeah, the, the, um, we now had Dean
[01:50:02] Ladd on, Taroa, right? And one of the things that he pointed out was when they were in,
[01:50:11] I think New Zealand. So in between, in between, Island storming in the Pacific,
[01:50:19] they were saying that, you know, one thing that they noticed about the Japanese was that the
[01:50:23] Japanese didn't adapt. They didn't change anything. They would do the same thing like not only from a,
[01:50:28] not only from a tactical perspective like, oh, we're going to rush you. And if we don't get
[01:50:33] through today, we're going to rush you tomorrow from the same position. But not like that, but then
[01:50:37] and you could see some changes in the way they defended the islands. Like sometimes they've
[01:50:41] let the Marines come ashore and then they've kind of set them up and sometimes they wouldn't let
[01:50:44] them come ashore. So they would make these small changes. But for the most part, it was like,
[01:50:48] we knew what the Japanese were going to do and they weren't going to change how they were doing
[01:50:51] things. And you know, I was talking to Lave about it. Lave's like, yeah,
[01:50:55] now it's kind of hard to pass on lessons learned when everyone is dead.
[01:51:01] Which is what was going on with the Japanese, right? Oh, you wanted to defend this island? Cool.
[01:51:04] Well, you know, lessons are getting to the next island, none of them, because you're all dead.
[01:51:09] You know, we, the only people that survive are 14 Korean slaves that two survives,
[01:51:15] everyone else dies. Yeah. But the fact that in this situation, yeah, and that is absolutely,
[01:51:22] you know, World War I just sickens me totally. And you know, all war is awful, but that war and
[01:51:29] the leadership in that war, to just Roger that. Yep, Roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Roger that.
[01:51:40] All right. Section here, areas of responsibility. There are four functional areas of
[01:51:47] responsibility in the culture of learning as shown in the following figure. And there's the
[01:51:51] other little figure here and it's got some circles that the smallest circle is marine,
[01:51:57] meaning the individual marine. And then the instructor and then the commander or leader
[01:52:05] and then the marine core as an entire institution. So it goes like this. First is it is each
[01:52:09] individual's marine's responsibility to progress in his or her own self education and build a
[01:52:17] bias for intelligent action. There's that's incumbent upon every single marine is to learn
[01:52:23] everything that you can and build a bias for intelligent action. There, there's another
[01:52:32] whip on that horse. I think they're making it perfectly clear to every marine that what we want
[01:52:41] you to do is take action to and some smart go. It must be interesting to tell these young
[01:52:48] fire team leaders or these two commanders like get them together and I'd be like a two commander.
[01:52:54] Imagine if every one of your, you have eight fire teams. Imagine if each one of your fire teams
[01:52:59] was doing something smart in support of what you were trying to make happen. How hard would your
[01:53:03] job be? And you'd be like not hard. And I'd be like, yeah, check. I'd be like fire team leaders.
[01:53:07] You hear that? This guy wants you to do stuff. He wants you to make something happen.
[01:53:12] Make something happen. Do us all a favor and make something happen. I'm tired of watching you
[01:53:17] guys sit around trying to form a perimeter being directed by the task you to commander himself
[01:53:22] on how to form the perimeter for the love of God. Would you take up a security position?
[01:53:31] Second, within formal schools instructors should be selected based upon their potential to become
[01:53:36] effective teachers facilitators and mentors and it goes into some of that third leaders at
[01:53:40] all levels are responsible for setting the conditions within the unit for the subordinates professional
[01:53:45] military learning and development. In the teams those two are probably opposite like, I don't know
[01:53:52] what's opposite, but there's no doubt that in the seal teams the leader of a platoon, like the leader
[01:54:00] and the platoon commander and the platoon chief or the task unit commander and the task unit senior
[01:54:04] in the list of the adviser, they are way more responsible than some instructor that you had anywhere
[01:54:09] along the way. I don't know if it's I don't know if you could make that statement about the Marine Corps.
[01:54:18] I think there's that hierarchical component that I think just sits inside it and I think a lot of ways
[01:54:22] it's sort of this connection of that's something that's very easily digestible for the lowest level
[01:54:26] of a range of recognized where they fit in the big picture, but the bigger thing that's happening
[01:54:29] there is that that sort of comes full circle when the Marine Corps as an institution has this obligation
[01:54:35] facility that that goes back and affects the individual marine and that your individual role actually
[01:54:41] plays, we talk about this all the time, you can plan outside influence on the entire organization
[01:54:46] if you were doing something that's making you better, which is making your team better and then each
[01:54:50] role in leadership has an obligation to facilitate that and then it comes right back to the individual.
[01:54:55] Whenever I talk about training with a company, I was maybe you can help me with my own quote,
[01:55:00] but it's something along the lines of training is the solemn duty of the leaders inside of it.
[01:55:06] You know, it's not the responsibility of the trainers, it's not the responsibility of the instructors,
[01:55:10] it's not the responsibility of the schoolhouse. If you work for me, I'm responsible for making
[01:55:14] sure you're trained and I can use those assets however I see fit, but I'm responsible for it.
[01:55:17] Yeah. And then finally the Marine Corps as an institution demonstrates a focus and commitment
[01:55:26] to encouraging career long learning by continuously refining, learning methods and providing resources
[01:55:32] and opportunities for professional development. That's the way the Marine Corps rolls.
[01:55:40] Professional expectations next section, Marines are expected to have
[01:55:45] initiative self-discipline and motivation to actively engage in learning opportunities on their own.
[01:55:53] Wouldn't that be nice if that was a universal truth about humans?
[01:55:57] Right? If we just said humans are expected to have initiative self-discipline and motivation
[01:56:02] to actively engage in learning opportunities on their own.
[01:56:05] Marine's must take ownership of personal learning by creating specific professional goals.
[01:56:16] Again, the evaluation that we wrote.
[01:56:21] After assessing progress, Marines may adjust their goals so that they may,
[01:56:24] this is that they remain challenging. Conversely, if a Marine struggles to attain a goal by the
[01:56:29] data established, the goal may need to be adjusted to include additional in-term steps, feedback, or modified
[01:56:35] timeline. Establish and clear, short, mid and long-term goals enables the Marines
[01:56:43] to plan a clear path forward toward professional development. And again, this is sort of the reason
[01:56:49] why we put together the code and the evaluation and the protocols for everything that just got
[01:56:55] just written right there. Yeah, that paragraph to me was what's huge. I highlighted the whole thing.
[01:56:59] I wrote the word dude and underlined it. Dude, this is ridiculous. And then I wrote down,
[01:57:04] this is why we did that ranking scale and I'm not qualified human being. If you're doing this
[01:57:08] thing and it's easy, guess what? You need to ramp it up because there's no longer your baseline.
[01:57:12] This is too easy for you, so you need to make that more challenging. And if not, you get to go back.
[01:57:16] But you need initiative, self-discipline, motivation and ownership. These are all, these are all,
[01:57:28] these are all my concurrence with all these. I'm telling you, other way. I know, I don't know these
[01:57:32] guys, but I know who these guys are, I know who these guys are.
[01:57:38] Uh, skip ahead a little bit. Learning is also a process of professional growth.
[01:57:45] Marines demonstrate motivation of professionalism by cultivating a growth mindset.
[01:57:49] Individuals with a growth mindset believe that effort and learning can change
[01:57:54] ones qualities, leading to development and success.
[01:58:01] Marines with a growth mindset understand that they have control over their individual learning.
[01:58:06] And that the additional effort pays off developing,
[01:58:09] in developing the knowledge and skills to improve. Conversely, individuals with the fixed
[01:58:15] mindset believe that their qualities are innate. And our interest in feedback only to confirm
[01:58:21] their abilities of avoiding feedback that indicates any perceived weaknesses.
[01:58:27] Avoiding feedback and having a fixed mindset leads to stagnation.
[01:58:43] And they wrap this chapter up. I mean, we could talk about intrinsic motivation is driven
[01:58:48] by perceived internal rewards. That is, one is driven to engage in a behavior because it is satisfying.
[01:58:53] Leaders can cultivate this type of motivation within Marines by supporting the growth mindset
[01:58:57] and individual Marines can sustain it throughout their careers. In this way, the Marine Corps
[01:59:01] culture of learning encourages commanders, leaders and structures teams and individuals to all
[01:59:07] support intrinsic motivation for learning in self improvement.
[01:59:10] The conclusion is they say the Marine Corps culture supports continuous career long learning.
[01:59:25] All Marines can facilitate learning. As Marines develop in their careers,
[01:59:28] the responsibility to facilitate learning also increases. Marine Corps culture embraces learning
[01:59:34] as fundamental to marine readiness to be the first to fight. Learning is essential to any
[01:59:39] present profession, but it is particularly important to the Marines' profession of arms
[01:59:45] with a cost of not learning. The cost of not learning are so steep.
[01:59:53] So that's chapter two. We're two hours deep right now in an order to not make a five-hour
[02:00:01] podcast. We will save the next four of the next podcast.
[02:00:09] So I guess echo Charles. Since we are going to try to continue to learn, continue to make
[02:00:20] continuous improvement. I don't know if there's any way that anything that you recommend
[02:00:29] we learn, perhaps? Sure. That could move us in the right direction. I recommend that we learn
[02:00:36] Jujitsu. One of the many recommendations. That we're coming. We stand the path. This is a
[02:00:43] real general way of putting it. So we're going to learn Jujitsu. We're going to stay in shape
[02:00:47] if not get in shape. We're going to stay functional and healthy. Functional, maybe that's a
[02:00:53] played out. Not played out, but that's maybe an overused word. We're going to say capable. How
[02:00:57] about that? Dave Burke. Good. I'm good at functional. I like capable. I like capable. Yeah.
[02:01:03] If you like capable, why did you say functional and then like deride it and then now you're
[02:01:08] calling it capable? I'm putting a what he called a fine point on it, like sharpening it. Like
[02:01:14] functional is like sure. Yes, functional. But let me get more specific capable. Okay. Even though that's
[02:01:20] pretty general. But to do these things, we're going to need what we're going to want certain tools.
[02:01:26] Okay. So for Jujitsu, we need a G. Rashcard. Boom. Where do we get the G. I think we are not all
[02:01:31] know, Basky in the world. Factually origin. Origin main.com. This is where you can look at all this stuff.
[02:01:37] Now, can we get G. Is it origin? Write this moment on in April 2020. Yeah. Can we? There are some
[02:01:48] G's still a bit. Look, we've done a little. We've had to make some adjustments to what we're
[02:01:53] doing in Maine because America needed certain items to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. So we had to
[02:02:03] adjust, make some adjustments and start making face coverings, which we are doing at a rapid pace,
[02:02:09] probably between 5 and 7,000 a day. The demand signal is very high. And so we are trying to get
[02:02:16] America what they need on those and look, they're not N95 masks, but at which we don't have the capability
[02:02:23] of making, which is why we weren't making any masks. But when the government and the CDC recommended
[02:02:29] face coverings for everyone, we started making face coverings. So that's what we're doing right now.
[02:02:35] As soon as we push through this, and as soon as really as other manufacturers pick up the slack,
[02:02:41] because we were able to move very quickly because we have the entire supply chain right there.
[02:02:47] We have the skills and capability. Okay, the ability all day. You know, we got crafts people up there
[02:02:54] that can go, oh, you want me to sew that cool. We can make that happen. Pete can design it. Okay,
[02:02:58] done. Pattern makers can make the patterns. Like we can get it done. And that went, the original
[02:03:05] death masks was Friday. We're talking about Monday. They're getting produced. There's not
[02:03:10] I don't think there's any businesses in the world that could do what Orange and just did right there.
[02:03:19] I'm going to say that again, on Friday, we're making rashguards on Monday morning full production
[02:03:25] of face coverings. So hey, look, but as soon as just as we pivoted quickly into that,
[02:03:32] as soon as some other manufacturers get caught up and people and the demand gets met will be right back
[02:03:39] to doing what we do and what we do, which is make stuff make a peril. So,
[02:03:45] just to a peril rashguards, keys, jeans, t-shirts, boots will be right back on all that stuff.
[02:03:52] So, you know, just be on standby. Yeah, good stuff for that. Again,
[02:03:57] OriginMain.com. Also at Origin,
[02:04:01] Jockel fuel. So, this will keep us capable. Keep us in the game. Look after our joints when we're
[02:04:08] lifting. It's a big deal. So, I'm saying. So, joint warfare, super-cryl oil.
[02:04:14] Samantha, oxygen to them, by the way. Also, Malk additional protein, protein, supplement.
[02:04:20] Are you showing the strawberry malk train? Yes. Really?
[02:04:26] Yes. How much do you have one a day? One a day.
[02:04:29] Okay. Sometimes, too. On some rare occasion, I will have a- How many scoops per per day?
[02:04:36] I'm a one scoop milk shaken in the bottle. Yeah. I don't do any other weird stuff for things.
[02:04:44] But there are times and I'm not going to waddy it. I've got a little extra time with my wife.
[02:04:48] Maybe watching TV a little bit on a Saturday night more than I have in the past because of what's going on.
[02:04:53] And I need a little- You know what? I need straight up made dessert.
[02:04:59] And I would just go back to the maltrain. So, that's my dessert. Saturday nights.
[02:05:04] I've had maybe a little extra these days. But during the day, do SOP for me is like, I will do malk.
[02:05:09] And what discipline in the can is your preferred flavor? Discipline in the can,
[02:05:14] deck savage with that question. Not the other two are fine, but given the choice, and I'm lucky enough
[02:05:19] to be one of those people that I have a choice. I have options. Decode on my request to deck savage.
[02:05:24] Just my thing. Interesting. How often do you drink one of those? One a day. What time?
[02:05:33] Usually, just a little bit after lunch. So, another thing is, I'm sitting in my desk longer during the day
[02:05:39] than I ever really have because usually, several days a week, I'm traveling. I'm going to hotel. I'm with
[02:05:43] client, I'm on a plane. And now I'm like, up in the morning, work out, get ready. And I sit down on my desk.
[02:05:49] And sometimes I'm sitting, literally sitting in my desk sometimes like 6, 7, 8 hours straight.
[02:05:54] Which I have, I typically don't do. Not normal. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. We're on
[02:05:57] one webinars, one podcasts. We're in the game, and I'm at my computer at that chair. And
[02:06:04] these, I say, ready to deploy, ready to drink cans. There's a deck savage. I get up, lunch, come
[02:06:09] upstairs. I don't usually eat a lunch. I don't really have a meal for lunch. I will have a
[02:06:15] deck savage shortly after lunch time. What do you feel when you, when you, once you've digested it,
[02:06:20] what do you feel? I feel good. What it really does for me is if I don't take it, I catch myself like,
[02:06:29] not, I catch myself mid early afternoon, wanting to not do what I'm doing. Now, a little breather,
[02:06:37] they're on a take a look. I'm going to push away and I'm like, nope, I'm not, I do not have time to do that.
[02:06:41] I take that, it's kind of almost like science at this point. I take that little hitter,
[02:06:44] and I'm in the game, and I can push through whatever that normally would be. The, hey,
[02:06:47] want you step away and kind of get some fresh air. I like, yeah, I'd love to. I would love to
[02:06:51] go do that. They're the football with my kids. And I try to do that sometimes. But right now,
[02:06:54] dude, April 20th, 2020, dude, we are grinding. Like, we are grinding at our, at our desk. That's what
[02:07:01] we're doing. This is the key. Yeah, I know to say, I will. So I'll get up. I'll have, I'll work out.
[02:07:08] I'll left. I'll have a handful of macadamia nuts or something. So now it's, you know,
[02:07:14] eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning. So when I start feeling a little hunger,
[02:07:17] and, you know, now when I'm sitting through my morning calls, whatever, talking to clients,
[02:07:23] I'm on the, I'm on the, um, just discipline powder, right, jockel Palmer. I'm just,
[02:07:31] I'm just kind of sipping. That's just kind of going through. It's just kind of,
[02:07:33] shhh, getting on step. And then, like, same thing around lunchtime. And usually, you know,
[02:07:41] whatever, I'll have a little gap in them. Like, okay, I got, I got an hour here. I got two hours
[02:07:45] here, and I'll go. I'm going to write, you know, I'm writing a book right now. So I'll be like,
[02:07:49] cool, but, but probably, as I know, I see that window approaching. Same thing, I'll be like, well,
[02:07:56] maybe it'd be a good time to check social media, or maybe be a good time to just turn my brain off.
[02:08:03] And you can feel that gravitational pull, right? So I go, oh, you know what?
[02:08:08] Crack it open 20 minutes, whatever, 30 minutes prior. Drink it. And what's cool is,
[02:08:13] I, it just happens that I get down a start hammering. And then a little while, I'm like,
[02:08:18] oh, what does have it? Because you get that little little little heater. So we got that.
[02:08:26] By the way, that's discipline go in a can discipline go or discipline powder form. That was
[02:08:33] the original. Yeah. And the jockel Palmer. Did I win away from powder when the cans came out?
[02:08:40] And when jockel Palmer came out, I went back to the back. Yeah, I stayed with the powder for a long time.
[02:08:47] Still going powder all day, every day. All day, every day. That's it. That's what I, I just stop.
[02:08:55] I, I won't have any discipline go in the can after two o'clock in the afternoon,
[02:09:02] three o'clock in the afternoon. Because then I'll just be, I'll be able to sleep, you know, so
[02:09:07] little cautious about that. Very true. Also, where your kid moke as well. Um, supplemental,
[02:09:15] dessert like protein. That's right. A lot of kids at home all day right now. Yes.
[02:09:20] They want a little bit of that. They want something that tastes good. Just get them some of that
[02:09:24] warrior kid moke. They think you're hooking them up. You are in a way. And you are in many ways
[02:09:31] from a taste perspective. You can get this stuff at vitamin chop too. Some of the vitamin
[02:09:36] chops if they're open. They got the full lineup. Um, cold war man. I talked about it last time.
[02:09:44] I'm on the cold war. You're on the cold war train. I'm on the cold war tank. Is that what you're
[02:09:49] in the tank? You're in cold war tank. You got armor. The tank of immune armor system. That,
[02:09:56] that cold war is in my repertoire. That's wake up in the morning. How many take in the morning?
[02:10:02] I take two in the morning, too. What are you doing? I take two in the morning. And that's all I take.
[02:10:06] Oh, I wonder if I need to take a floor. I don't know. You're looking kind of light.
[02:10:09] I don't know. I feel pretty good. I'm kind of exposed. No, no, no, no, no.
[02:10:14] Cold war's cold war's in the game right now. Yeah. Yeah. So all these things,
[02:10:18] origin, main.com. Also, jokboitavit on there. That's some good stuff. Surflight organic, too.
[02:10:25] Yeah, that's neat. For the organic folks. That's the refreshing.
[02:10:32] Yeah, just refreshing. Oh, yeah. Also, jokboit's a store. It's called jokbo store.
[02:10:39] So you go to jokbostore.com and this is where we can get our representative apparel
[02:10:46] when we're representing on the path while we're learning. It's what I'm saying. Well,
[02:10:50] we're improving ourselves. So we're saying learning. In quarantine or not. See, we have a new
[02:10:57] shirt. It's not that new, but we have a shirt. If you want to represent while on the path in quarantine,
[02:11:05] represent the quarantine scenario. That's what we've been doing. We're wearing levels of approval
[02:11:10] from jokbo on this one. It's a controversial shirt is what it is. Sometimes decentralized command,
[02:11:15] you know, sometimes it goes too far. People start doing things below the chain of command. They're
[02:11:20] not running their approval and things are just happening.
[02:11:25] Okay, prove things are happening. Oh, yeah. So I'm below the chain. Yes. You're up the chain. Yes. I run it up. Yes.
[02:11:31] And what happens? You want to tell the story. You're doing this. I don't think what you described
[02:11:36] this is echoed happen. This was a flat out that night. This is like a rejection of a plan.
[02:11:41] I'm like, we're doing it anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking maybe I wasn't clear enough.
[02:11:46] Apparently. No. I mean, I reread the text. I'm like, no, it doesn't get any more clear than that.
[02:11:52] Well, in this case, the people are essentially what you call that when you kind of, when you
[02:11:59] you don't overthrow them, but you assume it's saying, you know, one like the one government
[02:12:03] officials like, and then the people are like, well, you know, I don't know if we accept that,
[02:12:08] when we like it, you know, so the people. So there's a really really lovely view.
[02:12:13] And you know, we're going to go to the community run by echoed Charles. We moved forward and took
[02:12:17] smart action as it were. Anyway, go to jockelstar.com, look for the quarantine. Sure. If you like it,

[02:14:09] He makes videos where things explode. We make videos. Yeah. He makes videos where things explode.
[02:14:14] Sometimes way too many things explode. Sometimes too little. Sometimes a message could be
[02:14:19] perfectly clear. But it just seems to be need to be accented with explosions and fires.
[02:14:25] Sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. So YouTube channel. Also, you can watch this whole podcast on there.
[02:14:33] And enhance the videos. We also have psychological warfare, which is

[02:15:27] echelon front leadership consultancy, which is what Dave talked about earlier. You want to know
[02:15:33] what we're doing all day right now. That's what we're doing. We are talking to our clients.
[02:15:36] 20, 30, 40 people in a meeting. Four people in a meeting, one person in a meeting face to face.
[02:15:45] Is it legal? Dave Burke to say, I was on a zoom meeting with a client face to face. Yes.
[02:15:54] Because it's almost more face to face than when you're face to face. You're actually closer
[02:16:00] than normally would be where they'd be 30 feet away, sitting in some sort of classroom
[02:16:05] type scenario. Right. You are face to face and you are live. So we have adjusted our methodology
[02:16:14] at echelon front where we no longer will we will eventually go back and work face to face
[02:16:20] literally. But right now we are finding that the impact of this online virtual training
[02:16:29] is awesome. It allows us to have more interactions, closer interactions, more continuous
[02:16:34] interactions with the client. So if you need help in your business, aligning your leadership,
[02:16:39] go to echelon front.com for details. We also have EF online speaking of revamping.
[02:16:46] Look for a long time EF online was a static, but a static courses that you could go on there and
[02:16:53] take and they were static. They were they were interactive and you would run through scenarios.
[02:16:57] But it was pre-existing classes. So we've blown this thing wide open. We got live video webinars.
[02:17:05] We got Q&A is going on. We got immediate action drills on there. I got leadership primers. Just
[02:17:12] totally revamp that we also changed the whole pricing structure. They used to be like you're going
[02:17:17] to pay to take a class almost like you were going to college for a semester and you're going to
[02:17:21] learn these things. Now it's like, oh way cheaper subscription model or you can pay it once,
[02:17:26] but it's like boom come in and you're part of the gang and you're interacting with me. You're
[02:17:31] interacting with Dave. You're interacting with JP Lave. Mike's really the whole crew.
[02:17:35] That's what we're doing. We're on there. Some of you know Jason Gardner. You've heard Jason Gardner
[02:17:40] on the podcast. You want to talk to him? Cool. Go to EF online. You'll talk to him. You will talk
[02:17:43] to him as as Dave just said you'll be five inches away from his face. So that's what we're doing
[02:17:52] there. EF online.com. Check that out. We've got the musters, the Orlando muster was canceled.
[02:17:59] Phoenix. This is our leadership seminar in leadership event. Orlando is canceled. We got Phoenix
[02:18:07] in September 16th and 17th. We got Dallas, December 3rd and 4th. Check Extreme Ownership.com.
[02:18:13] Everything that we've done is sold out. We were going to do three now we're only doing two.
[02:18:17] So they're going to sell it even quicker. A bunch of people are already going and move their
[02:18:20] reservations. So if you want to come and extreme ownership.com for that. And then there's EF
[02:18:27] Overwatch where we take executive leadership from the military and place them into the civilian
[02:18:34] sector and then EF Legion.com. These are frontline leaders that are being placed into civilian
[02:18:43] companies. If you're and let me tell you if you're a vet right now there's a lot of companies
[02:18:47] that are out there hiring go to eFleagent.com and just enter yourself in there. So you get
[02:18:52] looked at. So people can see that you're available for employment. We got to hide demands signal
[02:18:57] from our companies that we work with that are reaching out looking for squared away veterans that
[02:19:03] understand the principles we talk about to go to eFleagent.com and enroll yourself. And if you
[02:19:09] haven't had enough of my tyrannical utterances or echoes delirious theories or Dave's over
[02:19:19] articulated speeches, then you can locate us on the inner webs on Twitter on Instagram and
[02:19:28] on Dine Freezy Bond. Dave is that David Arbork. I always add echo Charles and I am at Jocko
[02:19:35] willing to all you out there in uniform serving now or if you've ever served in the Army, Navy,
[02:19:40] Air Force or of course the Marine Corps. We salute you and your service and sacrifice for freedom
[02:19:48] and to the police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,
[02:19:52] border patrol and secret service. All you first responders thank you for your service here at home,
[02:20:01] taking care of us and to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel that are in the fight right now,
[02:20:08] battling against disease and despair. Thank you for your brave hearts and your benevolent hearts.
[02:20:21] And to everyone else out there, just remember what the Marine Corps teaches us that combat is a combination
[02:20:29] of fear, uncertainty, ambiguity, chance, horror and friction and life is much the same.
[02:20:39] Continuous learning is essential because it allows you to recognize, change, adapt to it
[02:20:46] and make decisions that lead to victory and failing to learn simply means failing.
[02:20:53] To win, you have to learn, so read, study, get experience, listen and live with a bias toward action.
[02:21:08] And be mind that is desperate to learn. And then, well, go out there and get after it.
[02:21:18] And until next time, this is Dave, Henako and Jocco.
