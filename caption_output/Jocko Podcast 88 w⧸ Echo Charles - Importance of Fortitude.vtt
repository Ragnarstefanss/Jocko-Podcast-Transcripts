00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.28
This is Jocco podcast, number 88.

2
00:00:04.28 --> 00:00:07.84
With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

3
00:00:07.84 --> 00:00:08.84
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:09.84
Good evening.

5
00:00:13.84 --> 00:00:18.20
I went into a public house to get a plane of beer.

6
00:00:18.20 --> 00:00:23.76
The public anye up and says, we serve no red coats here.

7
00:00:23.76 --> 00:00:29.44
The girls behind the bar, they laughed and giggled fit to die.

8
00:00:29.44 --> 00:00:32.20
I outstint to the streets again.

9
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:39.000
And to myself says, I, oh, it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.88
But it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.

11
00:00:43.88 --> 00:00:48.04
When the band begins to play, my boys, the band begins to play.

12
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:55.40
Oh, it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.

13
00:00:55.40 --> 00:00:59.44
I went into a theater as sober as could be.

14
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:05.64
They gave a drunk civilian room, but they hadn't known for me.

15
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:10.76
They sent me to the gallery around the music halls.

16
00:01:10.76 --> 00:01:15.44
But when it comes to fighting Lord, they shoved me in the stalls.

17
00:01:15.44 --> 00:01:19.32
For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy wait outside.

18
00:01:19.32 --> 00:01:24.68
But it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.

19
00:01:24.68 --> 00:01:29.72
The trooperships on the tide, my boys, the trooperships on the tide.

20
00:01:29.72 --> 00:01:36.52
Oh, it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.

21
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:41.96
Yes, make and mock a uniforms that guard you while you sleep.

22
00:01:41.96 --> 00:01:46.76
Is cheaper than them uniforms in their starvation cheap.

23
00:01:46.76 --> 00:01:51.64
And hustling drunken soldiers when they're going large a bit

24
00:01:51.64 --> 00:01:56.28
as five times better business than parade in full kit.

25
00:01:56.28 --> 00:02:01.48
Then it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy house your soul.

26
00:02:01.48 --> 00:02:06.32
But it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.

27
00:02:06.32 --> 00:02:11.08
The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll.

28
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:17.28
Oh, it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.

29
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:20.96
We are no thin red eros.

30
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:24.08
No, we aren't no black guards too.

31
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:29.32
But single men and barracks most remarkable like you.

32
00:02:29.32 --> 00:02:34.64
And if sometimes our conduct is an all-year fancy paints,

33
00:02:34.64 --> 00:02:40.08
why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.

34
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:45.000
While it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy fall behind.

35
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.68
But it's please walk in the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.

36
00:02:49.68 --> 00:02:53.20
When there's trouble in the wind, my boys, there's trouble in the wind.

37
00:02:53.20 --> 00:02:59.92
Oh, it's please walk to the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.

38
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:05.44
You talk a better food for us and schools and fires and all.

39
00:03:05.44 --> 00:03:09.68
We'll rate for extra rations if you treat us rational.

40
00:03:09.68 --> 00:03:14.72
Don't mess about the cookroom slops but prove it to our face.

41
00:03:14.72 --> 00:03:20.32
The widows uniform is not the soldier's men's disgrace.

42
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:25.12
For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and chuck him out the brute.

43
00:03:25.12 --> 00:03:29.60
But it's safe your other country when the guns begin to shoot.

44
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:33.84
And it's Tommy this and Tommy that and anything you please.

45
00:03:33.84 --> 00:03:36.88
And Tommy ain't a blooming fool.

46
00:03:36.88 --> 00:03:45.52
You bet that Tommy sees.

47
00:03:45.52 --> 00:03:52.80
And that is another poem from Kippling.

48
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:57.44
It's actually one of my favorites from Kippling.

49
00:03:57.44 --> 00:04:02.24
And you can follow it and you can go back and read through it,

50
00:04:02.24 --> 00:04:09.60
look it up online and it's explaining how the soldier doesn't get me respect during peace time.

51
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:17.12
But when it's time to fight, when the troop ship is on the tide,

52
00:04:17.12 --> 00:04:22.56
then it's Tommy, which is slang for the British soldier, then it's Tommy to the front of a line.

53
00:04:22.56 --> 00:04:32.24
But the point that I wanted to focus on is the line in the poem where it says,

54
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:37.28
and if sometimes our conduct is in all your fancy paints,

55
00:04:39.12 --> 00:04:42.72
why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.

56
00:04:42.72 --> 00:04:52.48
And what that means is that soldiers and marines and sailors and those men that go out

57
00:04:52.48 --> 00:04:56.88
into harm's way voluntarily, they're not always boy scouts.

58
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:00.72
They're not going to be plaster saints.

59
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:04.96
You know plaster saint, like you have, the little statue of a saint of a Christian saint.

60
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:10.56
The soldiers are going to be a little rough around the edges.

61
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:14.24
They might be a little bit rowdy, they might be a little bit brash, they might be a little bit

62
00:05:14.24 --> 00:05:16.16
drunk, they might be trouble makers.

63
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:21.60
Now they're not all like that, obviously.

64
00:05:23.28 --> 00:05:24.08
But some of them are.

65
00:05:25.76 --> 00:05:28.08
And guess what? Who else is going to go forward?

66
00:05:30.32 --> 00:05:33.68
Who else is going to go put their life on the line?

67
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.08
It's these guys. And by the way, when you are raised in barracks,

68
00:05:40.08 --> 00:05:46.56
a single man in barracks, you're going to find some trouble from time to time.

69
00:05:47.44 --> 00:05:50.64
And then once you take these young men and you put them in a battle,

70
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:59.84
once you subject them to fear and terror and death,

71
00:05:59.84 --> 00:06:07.28
can we assume now and expect them to act like saints?

72
00:06:10.32 --> 00:06:15.12
Can we somehow expect that their behavior is now going to transition to becoming beyond

73
00:06:16.08 --> 00:06:18.88
reproach in the way they carry themselves?

74
00:06:21.44 --> 00:06:23.28
I don't think that's a realistic outlook.

75
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:33.04
Now the book that we're going to look at today is an example of war and it shows once again that war

76
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:35.76
is brutal.

77
00:06:38.16 --> 00:06:43.68
Not just in actions, but also in attitude, in language.

78
00:06:45.28 --> 00:06:50.88
And in the way it impacts men both physically and mentally.

79
00:06:50.88 --> 00:06:58.56
And this book is raw, it's graphic, it's brutish and it's real.

80
00:07:00.64 --> 00:07:04.16
And the language that's in it, that's offensive. I leave it in.

81
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:09.60
Why? Because war is offensive.

82
00:07:11.44 --> 00:07:16.48
And the language used in war is also offensive and if you don't want to hear offensive

83
00:07:16.48 --> 00:07:24.80
language or graphic descriptions or completely politically incorrect statements being made,

84
00:07:24.80 --> 00:07:33.76
then don't listen to this podcast. The book is called Excursion in Hell.

85
00:07:36.80 --> 00:07:45.36
And it tracks the experience of its author, or guy by the name of Vincent Bramley,

86
00:07:45.36 --> 00:07:56.24
who's a young corporal in third battalion of the British armies, parachute regimen,

87
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:59.12
otherwise known as the three Paris.

88
00:08:03.36 --> 00:08:11.28
Now the book starts off kind of with the way the the Falkland Islands is starting to escalate

89
00:08:11.28 --> 00:08:15.68
and as it's starting to escalate, they get put on their England.

90
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:24.64
The three Paris get put onto a cruise ship, a chartered cruise ship called the SS Cannebara

91
00:08:24.64 --> 00:08:30.88
and their sailing south towards the Falkland Islands. And now we, they're starting to get

92
00:08:30.88 --> 00:08:34.32
information, they're starting to get intelligence and start to get briefed on what's happening.

93
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:37.68
Because these guys didn't even know where the Falkland Islands were. I mean, a lot of them,

94
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:41.20
they didn't know where they were. Some random island out in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't

95
00:08:41.20 --> 00:08:44.64
find it on a map, a lot of them. Well now they're definitely looking at it and they're trying

96
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:50.08
to figure out what's going on there. So, they're starting to get some of these briefs. We're going

97
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:57.52
to the book now. Our lectures were in the early afternoon now. The most memorable was by some of the

98
00:08:57.52 --> 00:09:01.52
very keen Marines who had been serving in the Falklands at the time of the invasion.

99
00:09:01.52 --> 00:09:07.84
The Falkland Islands were in a British, I guess you'd call it a colony, but not a colony. It's

100
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:18.56
a little British, it was owned by the British at the time. And the Argentinians invaded it.

101
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:27.68
So, here we go. Obviously, listening to first-hand experience was better than listening to

102
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:33.76
some officer lecturing us on his personal beliefs at the time. However, an intelligence officer

103
00:09:33.76 --> 00:09:38.56
from way up top gave a graphic account of what the RGs that's what they call the Argentinians. The

104
00:09:38.56 --> 00:09:44.88
RGs were up to at the time. The intelligence constantly coming in was essential to all levels.

105
00:09:46.08 --> 00:09:51.76
What I remember most about this lecture was the officer standing proudly in front of us saying

106
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:58.56
the Argentin Army is the best and strongest in South America. He told us you will be in for a big

107
00:09:58.56 --> 00:10:04.80
scrap if it comes to war jense. Have no qualms about it. At the last recorded reports,

108
00:10:04.80 --> 00:10:10.48
the RGs have about 9,000 men in fortified positions around Stanley, the capital.

109
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:17.28
But we also have good reports that they are underfed, Morales low, and they have taken a eating

110
00:10:17.28 --> 00:10:23.12
horses and sheep, which they have been stealing from the inhabitants. That's the local people

111
00:10:23.12 --> 00:10:29.84
that lived on the Falkland Islands. This tells us that they are very undisciplined and goes to

112
00:10:29.84 --> 00:10:34.24
show that conscription is going to be their mistakes. So, they have some of their soldiers are

113
00:10:34.24 --> 00:10:43.04
conscripts, meaning they're forced into the army. Like a draft? Like, yes. My immediate feelings

114
00:10:43.04 --> 00:10:51.28
were 9,000 fucking men, and we only have 2 or 3,000. What the fuck is the big brass up to?

115
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:58.96
So, what was interesting about this is one of the things that I really

116
00:10:58.96 --> 00:11:03.60
this reminded me of is these guys have never been to work before. That matter fact he doesn't even

117
00:11:03.60 --> 00:11:10.96
mention anyone that has any prior combat experience. So, this reminds me of when I was on all my

118
00:11:10.96 --> 00:11:15.28
first deployments. Like, I talked about being off the coast of Somalia. I talked about being off

119
00:11:15.28 --> 00:11:21.52
the coast of Rwanda. And that's the position that these guys were in. And what our mindset was,

120
00:11:21.52 --> 00:11:27.44
if I was to go into Rwanda when I was a kid, when I was, you know, however old I was 22 years old,

121
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:32.48
never been in combat before, I would be completely different person than if I went in right now

122
00:11:32.48 --> 00:11:36.48
with my, you know, all the things that we talked about all the time. I mean, I would be, I just

123
00:11:36.48 --> 00:11:44.56
understand combat. I understand Warbetter. I'm 45 years old. I've been in combat leadership positions,

124
00:11:44.56 --> 00:11:50.48
been in fire fights. I understand these things. It might add it to you to be completely different.

125
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:59.44
Almost completely different than it would be than it was when I was 22 or 23 years old,

126
00:11:59.44 --> 00:12:03.60
sitting there fired up with a million rounds. And, you know, it's like, Lave talking, I've ever,

127
00:12:03.60 --> 00:12:08.08
you know, getting ready to go into Somalia or Rwanda, I had like hundreds of pounds of gear,

128
00:12:08.08 --> 00:12:13.12
grenades. We were so loaded. I was too heavy. Because we're, if I were going to World War 3.

129
00:12:14.08 --> 00:12:19.44
And that's the, that's what these guys are like. They don't, they're, they're, they're,

130
00:12:19.44 --> 00:12:24.56
they just don't, they never in a combat. And I think, you know, everything. Yeah, they're trying to be

131
00:12:24.56 --> 00:12:28.72
ready for everything. And, and just their attitude, and you can see it actually carries through

132
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:34.72
this thing is almost like, and this is what he says too. A lot of times it's almost like they're on

133
00:12:34.72 --> 00:12:39.68
this giant, really hard training exercise. Obviously it turns very,

134
00:12:40.64 --> 00:12:47.84
sour at some points and very much, much more beyond that. But this is what a lot of this reminds

135
00:12:47.84 --> 00:12:52.64
me of these guys. Now, some of these guys have been in, I guess the combat experience that these

136
00:12:52.64 --> 00:12:55.76
guys would have had, and I, and I should have remembered this. I didn't, you know what these guys

137
00:12:55.76 --> 00:12:59.60
had combat experience, they had combat experience from being in Northern Ireland. So most of them

138
00:12:59.60 --> 00:13:04.40
had done deployments over in the Northern Ireland. But I think that was a little bit more of a,

139
00:13:05.92 --> 00:13:10.48
not, it's not, it's not the full kind of combat that are about to get engaged in here. So,

140
00:13:12.32 --> 00:13:20.16
that's what it reminds me of here in the way they're talking. All right. So, back to the book on

141
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:29.52
three May the submarine HMS conquer sank the Argentinian ship general Belgrano with a loss of about

142
00:13:29.52 --> 00:13:35.76
300 lives. When this news was first brought to us, we were skeptical thinking, yeah, okay.

143
00:13:37.04 --> 00:13:42.88
Once the news was official, it wasn't greeted with total enthusiasm. In the bar that night,

144
00:13:42.88 --> 00:13:50.72
most of us were solemn. We now knew war was inevitable. They have a bar. It's a cruise ship that

145
00:13:50.72 --> 00:13:53.92
they're on. So they have a bar and they're drinking. They're getting some allotment of beers in there.

146
00:13:53.92 --> 00:13:58.72
That's where they're hanging out. But all of a sudden this is real. You know, you don't kill 300,

147
00:13:58.72 --> 00:14:03.60
you know, enemy sailors and think you're not going to go to war. And it comes back back to the

148
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:09.28
book the night of four May while we were playing Bingo in the bar. News came that the HMS

149
00:14:09.28 --> 00:14:15.84
Sheffield had been hit by an RG exeset, which is a type of missile and was sinking. The loss of a

150
00:14:15.84 --> 00:14:21.20
hair your jet was also reported. The news hit the troops on board like a sledgehammer.

151
00:14:21.20 --> 00:14:26.96
Until now, everything we had heard had been in our favor. South Georgia had been retaken and the

152
00:14:26.96 --> 00:14:32.80
RG's submarine patrol boats had all been hit even their inland positions had been bombed by the navy

153
00:14:32.80 --> 00:14:38.96
and now the Belgrano, which was the ship that it sunk, sinking the Sheffield was the first of

154
00:14:38.96 --> 00:14:45.52
their strike backs. Moral in the bar that night swung from an incredible high to an almost

155
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:53.28
sickening silence. And he talks about this, but the waiting, these guys are now,

156
00:14:53.28 --> 00:14:57.60
it's a long cruise down there. I think it takes about three or three weeks to get down.

157
00:14:58.88 --> 00:15:02.72
Back to the book, the day after the Sheffield's hit, we knew our weight was coming to an end.

158
00:15:03.60 --> 00:15:08.48
The atmosphere was quiet and a morale booster was now much needed. The only thing possible for the task

159
00:15:08.48 --> 00:15:15.04
force was revenge. The sinking of the Sheffield had hit us as if we had lost a personal friend,

160
00:15:15.04 --> 00:15:21.12
tension mounted, frustration showed in everyone's eyes. The fitness drills were now carried out

161
00:15:21.12 --> 00:15:26.80
in full kit and pounding the decks in the heat was gutty work. So the whole time they've been

162
00:15:26.80 --> 00:15:31.28
steaming down there, they've been out there running laps on the all the deck of the cruise,

163
00:15:31.28 --> 00:15:40.96
ship trying to get in shape for what's coming. Back to the book, the main info we picked up

164
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:45.60
suggested a possible move on 20 May. So they're trying to figure out what's going on. They're

165
00:15:45.60 --> 00:15:49.60
down. These guys, you know, pretty low on the total pull, they're trying to figure out what's going

166
00:15:49.60 --> 00:15:52.80
on. They're hearing all these different rumors and now they picked up that maybe they're going to

167
00:15:52.80 --> 00:15:58.80
go on 20 May. Back to the book, our nerves now started. The move south was steady and without any

168
00:15:58.80 --> 00:16:06.48
real complications, but further south we went, the further we were going in. Somehow, I and many others

169
00:16:06.48 --> 00:16:11.44
still didn't quite believe the war was going to happen. We were lost in our own thoughts on many

170
00:16:11.44 --> 00:16:17.76
different subjects. Home became secondary now. I thought about the ifs and winds of our arrival

171
00:16:17.76 --> 00:16:23.84
in the exclusion zone and to the landings and battles to follow. Home was not my immediate thoughts.

172
00:16:23.84 --> 00:16:33.36
Survival was speculation was now rife as to what the landing procedure would be. We were still

173
00:16:33.36 --> 00:16:39.44
very much in the dark as to what was happening. But the next within the next 24 hours, all the bullshed,

174
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:44.56
rumors and personal beliefs were corrected by the platoon commander. Gents, he said,

175
00:16:45.36 --> 00:16:53.76
it's the green light. So they know they're now going in. And now they're getting

176
00:16:53.76 --> 00:16:59.36
into the serious preparations, packing and repacking to make our webbing as comfortable as possible.

177
00:16:59.36 --> 00:17:04.40
We began to psych ourselves up for the days ahead. It was nerve-racking beyond belief.

178
00:17:04.40 --> 00:17:09.60
Yet morale seemed remarkably high throughout the ship, though the laughing and joking among the

179
00:17:09.60 --> 00:17:15.92
lads was partly to cover the fear. Not that anyone thought death was going to hit him. That was

180
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:21.92
for the guy you were talking to. Getting the common belief that the common belief that we hear

181
00:17:21.92 --> 00:17:30.64
quite a bit, which is not going to happen to me. And I will say this as I say it for all these

182
00:17:30.64 --> 00:17:37.20
shows that we do. I'm skipping a bunch of stuff. I'm giving you some of the high points, but the

183
00:17:37.20 --> 00:17:40.56
way he lays this out, the tension that he builds, he does an outstanding job,

184
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:48.000
getting the tension and capturing it. And I'm going through it pretty quickly, but it's worth reading

185
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.08
because, and I think it's worth reading because if you're in one of these situations,

186
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:55.68
especially when you're in charge of guys that have never been to combat before, this is what you

187
00:17:55.68 --> 00:18:02.16
got to, it gives you a good lessons about keeping guys informed about preparing them for combat

188
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:09.44
and keeping them with the right mindset going in. So now they actually transfer from the cruise ship

189
00:18:09.44 --> 00:18:13.84
now they get onto a warship and eventually they end up on a landing craft. That's, that's

190
00:18:13.84 --> 00:18:20.16
heading to shore because they're going to war. Again, I covered that what in six minutes right now,

191
00:18:20.72 --> 00:18:25.84
it's, it's much more well detailed in the book. But right now they're getting ready to

192
00:18:26.80 --> 00:18:32.32
do their landing. Back to the book. The area now looked like an overcrowded tube train. The

193
00:18:32.32 --> 00:18:36.96
troops had pushed so close together that you could count the blackheads on your neighbor's face.

194
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:41.36
I sat on my kit observing the order to keep all noise down, no talking.

195
00:18:41.36 --> 00:18:48.40
I looked around, I looked around me at the hundreds of cammed faces so they got cammed camouflage

196
00:18:48.40 --> 00:18:55.28
paint on at hundreds of cammed faces all with big wide eyes. Each face told its own story.

197
00:18:55.28 --> 00:19:01.52
Each, each soldier had his own thoughts about the coming battle and the lads as the

198
00:19:01.52 --> 00:19:06.48
lads quietly sat about waiting, always waiting. The story of all soldiers.

199
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:12.48
Myself, I couldn't help but think that it was still a joke and that we wouldn't be going to

200
00:19:12.48 --> 00:19:18.72
shore. My stomach was not and the nauseous, hard to control. The nervousness running through

201
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:22.80
me was the worst of all waiting, waiting for that fucking green light.

202
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:30.48
Doc Murdock, Doc Murdock sat next to me pulling faces like a comedian. Fuck off, Doc, I said,

203
00:19:30.48 --> 00:19:40.48
I've got the gidders. We've all got to go somewhere, then, don't worry. The frustration of waiting

204
00:19:40.48 --> 00:19:45.44
and all the hassles of the last six weeks disappeared as we watched in stunned silence.

205
00:19:45.44 --> 00:19:52.48
The battle for fanning head to our left. Fanning head was the RGOP near San Carlos.

206
00:19:52.48 --> 00:19:57.28
The SAS had mounted an attack there to allow our landings to go ahead without interference.

207
00:19:57.28 --> 00:20:02.80
The tracer rounds and naval bombardment on the tip of the bay brought us abruptly into the

208
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:09.44
real world. Jesus, look at that. It's a fireworks display shouted a lad at the front of the craft.

209
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:15.76
Shut up and face the coming beach. We hadn't noticed we were moving towards the beach. All heads

210
00:20:15.76 --> 00:20:20.64
had been turned to watch the battle. So that's a little wake-up call. They're going into

211
00:20:20.64 --> 00:20:27.76
do their beach landing and there's a massive firefight going on where the SAS is doing a hit. Now,

212
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:34.96
as they get on, they do their landing their landing is on a post and they're starting to

213
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:43.20
patrol movement towards one of their objectives. Here we go. When we passed San Carlos,

214
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:48.56
two gazelle helicopters had just been shot down by some of the fleeing enemy.

215
00:20:48.56 --> 00:20:54.08
Word very quickly went around that the crew had been shot in the water while trying to swim

216
00:20:54.08 --> 00:21:00.80
ashore. Our anger brought home the reality of war and introduced us to the type of enemy we would

217
00:21:00.80 --> 00:21:07.84
be fighting. I would personally felt that if we could have caught those responsible,

218
00:21:07.84 --> 00:21:16.08
we would have killed them for the cowardly act. So there's some,

219
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:23.28
well, cowardly acts. I guess is the word used. So the guys are trying to swim to safety and

220
00:21:23.28 --> 00:21:31.52
they get shot in helicopter pilots. They get into a position and they they hold up for a while

221
00:21:31.52 --> 00:21:38.000
in a security position. Back to the book, guard sat behind the SF gun for two hours on,

222
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.44
for off, there's no sleep to be had. What with the cold rain, ponchos,

223
00:21:45.44 --> 00:21:49.44
flapping all over the place and everyone restlessly changing positions all the time.

224
00:21:50.80 --> 00:21:56.000
It was a great first night. So they're out there, they're freezing. It's, that's one thing. They

225
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.72
weren't really prepared for, they weren't really prepared for this cold weather.

226
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:08.24
And, but that's how they kick off. No enemy contact yet other than what they can see off in the

227
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:16.40
distance. They get gathered up for a little morning meeting. Back to the book, Pete Gray,

228
00:22:17.20 --> 00:22:22.48
gathered the NCOs around him for a daily brief and informed us of the things we weren't interested in.

229
00:22:23.20 --> 00:22:29.60
But also informed us that A company and C company had had a blue on blue sometime earlier.

230
00:22:29.60 --> 00:22:36.24
Apparently, both companies had patrols out to look for the RGs who had escaped on our landing.

231
00:22:37.04 --> 00:22:40.88
One patrol had spotted the other and asked for mortars on their position seen.

232
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:45.68
In turn, the other company asked for artillery on the first company.

233
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:51.60
So a battle between A company and C company both firing small arms at each other.

234
00:22:51.60 --> 00:22:59.44
Within minutes, the operations officer in charge realized the arrow, error, and radioed for a ceasefire.

235
00:23:00.96 --> 00:23:06.72
But not before three to four lads and been badly shot up to them suffering head wounds.

236
00:23:08.72 --> 00:23:16.000
The ops officer was temporarily removed from the task. So again, we got relatively unexperienced

237
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.32
guys. They're out there and again, obviously I highlight that because blue on blue is real thing.

238
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:29.28
And people don't think it's going to happen. I think Laf was talking about this.

239
00:23:29.68 --> 00:23:32.48
If you would have asked someone in T.U. Bruser,

240
00:23:33.92 --> 00:23:38.000
he said, one of the chances that we're going to have a blue on blue on our deployment. People would have

241
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.84
been like zero percent. They would have the zero percent because it was that, that's that taboo.

242
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:49.36
And the fact that, you know, there's a blue on blue that we talk about in extreme ownership,

243
00:23:49.36 --> 00:23:57.52
but there's blue on blues all the time in our body. And this is another example of how easy it is

244
00:23:57.52 --> 00:24:00.08
to have it happen between two companies in the same battalion.

245
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:14.48
Hmm. Back to the book, well lads, bad news said Pete, the Atlantic conveyor has been sunk.

246
00:24:15.60 --> 00:24:19.28
How the fuck did that get hit as someone from the rear? You tell me,

247
00:24:20.24 --> 00:24:25.44
Pete wasn't a happy man nor were we for the ship had been carrying the chinooks and luxury

248
00:24:25.44 --> 00:24:34.72
kit like tents, overboots and so on. So there was a supply ship, well a ship that had a bunch of

249
00:24:34.72 --> 00:24:39.28
supplies on it, including helicopters and helicopters was what's supposed to transport the

250
00:24:39.28 --> 00:24:44.32
Paris around Falkland. That was the plan. That just got sunk. And not only to get sunk with the

251
00:24:44.32 --> 00:24:49.92
helicopter's on it, it got sunk with the things like tents and sleeping bags that's going to allow

252
00:24:49.92 --> 00:24:55.12
them to be, you know, operate comfortably in this cold environment. If you don't know where

253
00:24:55.12 --> 00:25:03.76
Falkland Islands is, it's down by Antarctica. Back to the book, some bastard should fall for this.

254
00:25:03.76 --> 00:25:10.08
We thought all that kit on one bloody ship. Bad news of our choppers being sunk hit us

255
00:25:10.08 --> 00:25:15.68
sorely and many of us were still thinking about it when Pete announced the next info. No choppers.

256
00:25:16.72 --> 00:25:24.08
So the big wigs have decided that we start walking ASAP like today. Pete gave us a break

257
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:30.24
down of what was happening. Two parah was on the march to Goose Green. 45 commander were

258
00:25:30.24 --> 00:25:36.72
were to head north to a settlement called Douglas. We of three parah were to take Tiel inlet.

259
00:25:38.64 --> 00:25:44.32
Within an hour, all kit was packed tightly away. Last meals and bruised demolished, weapons

260
00:25:44.32 --> 00:25:50.08
oiled and ready and bunkers evacuated. Bruise. He's talking about tea.

261
00:25:50.08 --> 00:26:01.76
And the brits, if you don't know, they like their tea. It's epic. And I saw that with brits that I've

262
00:26:01.76 --> 00:26:05.68
worked with, obviously, I'm married to a brit, so I know how much they like tea and drink tea.

263
00:26:07.04 --> 00:26:13.68
I saw it overseas. Guys would be ready to brew tea at any given time. The first people

264
00:26:13.68 --> 00:26:19.52
the Sri Lankan, when I was working with the Sri Lankan guys back in the burr of Kronin. They

265
00:26:19.52 --> 00:26:24.96
have had the influence by the British army and by the British culture. Because that was a

266
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:30.24
British settlement for a long time. They got their tea on too. They would brew any, you know,

267
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:34.56
you need to take a break for 10 minutes. These guys would be over there with a little stove,

268
00:26:34.56 --> 00:26:40.48
little hex lamp brewing up a tea. So that's something that you're going to, and I'm talking

269
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:46.16
about it now. I don't highlight as much as I could in this podcast, but that's what they're talking about.

270
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:53.60
Having a cup of tea. Yeah, doing a brew. When I worked with guys, the SAS guys that would

271
00:26:53.60 --> 00:26:58.80
come and stay with us here, those guys were the same way. Get the brew tea on. Yeah, got to have

272
00:26:58.80 --> 00:27:08.24
the guy that had a cup of tea. Solid. Back to the book, we made our way up the prominent part

273
00:27:08.24 --> 00:27:13.92
of windy gap where most of the baton was gathering. The CSM, that's the command sergeant major

274
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:20.32
of B company was organizing which kit we were to carry and which to leave. No tried, no trypots

275
00:27:20.32 --> 00:27:25.36
for the SF guns and the SF guns are sustained fire guns. Basically a big heavy machine gun.

276
00:27:26.72 --> 00:27:32.16
That that takes a crew to operate. So you have a tripod. Someone cares the tripod. Someone cares

277
00:27:32.16 --> 00:27:34.88
the gun. Someone cares the ammunition. At least I think that's how they break it up.

278
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:42.80
No trypots for the SF guns and no sleeping bags. No burdens. Bergen's is what the Brits

279
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:50.56
call their big backpack or big rucksacks. All unnecessary weight to be left. We repacked our kit.

280
00:27:50.56 --> 00:27:55.36
The Bergen's and Tripods were centralized for a later pick-up. They were to be choppered

281
00:27:55.36 --> 00:28:02.48
forward if a chopper became available. We all felt pissed off about the conveyor being sunk

282
00:28:02.48 --> 00:28:09.04
and the prospect of the coming tab. So they call a march or hump they call it a tab.

283
00:28:09.04 --> 00:28:20.16
We were pissed off about the coming tab. We knew that the march would be about 50 kilometers.

284
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:27.20
But we were all glad to be moving breaking out across the island on the offensive. We set out at about

285
00:28:27.20 --> 00:28:30.96
two-thirty in the afternoon on what was to be an epic march for the regiment.

286
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:39.44
With the GPMG, that's a general purpose machine gun. Weeping order and ammo slung over

287
00:28:39.44 --> 00:28:44.16
every part of our bodies, we tabbed or rather hobbled as fast as we could.

288
00:28:45.04 --> 00:28:49.12
Once over the first hill we started to march around the side of an adjoining hill.

289
00:28:49.12 --> 00:28:54.000
At this time the Marines were walking alongside us ready to break northwards toward Douglas

290
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.88
towards the Douglas settlement. Unlike us, they carried full kit, Bergen's and all.

291
00:28:58.88 --> 00:29:04.08
Within 30 minutes we had a short break to let the stragglers catch up. A young Marine was

292
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:09.84
propped on his back beside me with his Bergen as a support. You lot have the right idea he said.

293
00:29:09.84 --> 00:29:16.32
No fucking extras. We look like donkeys here. I couldn't help but agree with him. But thought

294
00:29:16.32 --> 00:29:21.76
to myself that while we may move faster we'd be coldest at night. At that time I didn't

295
00:29:21.76 --> 00:29:31.84
know we'd be marching flat out all the way day and night. In less than an hour our bodies were

296
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:38.96
struggling under the weight of kit and ammo. The GPMG seemed away at ton. We swapped it on every

297
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:43.60
short break within the first two hours. The night march orders were passed slowly back along the

298
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:49.92
length of the battalion that we'd be stopping for 15 minutes in every hour. Some even started clock

299
00:29:49.92 --> 00:29:56.08
watching. Our boots and wet socks were becoming unbearable to march in rubbing badly on the feet

300
00:29:56.08 --> 00:30:04.64
most. If not all of us. Blisters and spraying ankles added unexpectedly to the injury tool.

301
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:09.92
I haven't done a good job of describing the terrain. It's miserable terrain. Just rocks,

302
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:18.24
slippery rocks, big steep hills. It's go look at it on, you look at some images of what the terrain

303
00:30:18.24 --> 00:30:26.32
in the Falkland Islands is like. It's nightmare to patrol along. It's going to snow.

304
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:34.000
It's not snowing yet but it's going to snow. It's actually in some ways worse. It's

305
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.52
worse to have because if it's cold enough that it's snowing snow is generally dry. If that makes

306
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:49.04
sense rain is rain. You get rained on your wet. If you get snowed on you can maintain your

307
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:54.96
dryness. If you're in a really cold environment where it's snowing that's okay. It doesn't make

308
00:30:54.96 --> 00:31:03.12
you wet and wet makes you cold. It's the worst thing is right on that borderline between

309
00:31:03.12 --> 00:31:07.44
because then you get rained on but then when the sun goes down it turns into freezing. So this is the worst

310
00:31:07.44 --> 00:31:14.40
worst environment you could want for the situation that they're in and all they're given. They

311
00:31:14.40 --> 00:31:21.44
only have what limited gear they should have got sunk on a boat or it's in their burdens but

312
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:26.32
even the stuff that's in their burdens isn't the best winter equipment they would want. All that

313
00:31:26.32 --> 00:31:39.36
stuff got sunk. So he's got a guy that's starting to slack a little bit. His name is Taft.

314
00:31:39.36 --> 00:31:45.52
Taft moved up. Move up by screamed. I can't vent some fucked. I was losing my rag. I could see

315
00:31:45.52 --> 00:31:49.76
he was out of it but I couldn't stand the fact that he was going to let us down before we'd even

316
00:31:49.76 --> 00:31:54.48
got there. Taft was trying to keep up and mumbling out loud that he could do it if only we were

317
00:31:54.48 --> 00:32:00.16
to slow down a little bit but this was impossible. Nobody could tell the lead elements to slow down.

318
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:06.72
The gap got bigger, the swearing got louder. Taft wasn't the only one to feel the strain.

319
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:13.44
Many of the lads were struggling. At last exhausted we stopped on the slope of yet another wind swept

320
00:32:13.44 --> 00:32:20.32
hill. Taft shook uncontrollably. He had a bad cramp and lay there totally out of the game.

321
00:32:20.32 --> 00:32:29.12
I informed the medics. Steve was sitting beside his usual when the unusual order came from the

322
00:32:29.12 --> 00:32:35.44
CO. The commanding officer. Brew up a hot cup of and make a snack. That was the order.

323
00:32:36.16 --> 00:32:40.80
This shocked a lot of us. Theoretically it was a no-no sitting in the middle of an advance

324
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:46.24
in the open and pitch dark practically though. It was the best order yet. A welcome brew was

325
00:32:46.24 --> 00:32:51.44
what we needed. The CO was obviously aware that the lads were suffering from the speed of the march.

326
00:32:53.84 --> 00:32:59.68
To me, Taft looked as though he was about to die. His nine stone frame wasn't strong enough

327
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:04.72
for the rest of the march. Taft could run the British, the army's British fitness test in

328
00:33:04.72 --> 00:33:11.28
around eight minutes and was considered our best runner. This proves as do other accounts I heard

329
00:33:11.28 --> 00:33:16.48
after the war that the fitness of troops cannot be determined by how fast they can run.

330
00:33:17.36 --> 00:33:22.16
The peros always pride themselves on tabbing with kit. That means marching with gear.

331
00:33:22.80 --> 00:33:29.20
And rightly so. But I learned to lesson on our first night's march. You must have body fat on

332
00:33:29.20 --> 00:33:35.20
you to waste for that kind of long tab that we had embarked on. So got a guy that's like,

333
00:33:35.20 --> 00:33:39.04
you know, a super thin triathlete. Now he's now you put a bunch of weight on him.

334
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:47.44
He's hurting. And I'll tell you that that also, that's a generalization too. That's not a waste

335
00:33:47.44 --> 00:33:53.36
too. I know some guys that were lean and could run fast and they could also haunt the rock. Like it was

336
00:33:53.36 --> 00:34:00.40
there, like it was there business. Now they start gathering up kind of the guys that

337
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:05.60
can't continue and they lead, they actually leave these guys that can't continue in a

338
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:11.20
perimeter area. And then we're going back to the book. We slogged it out for another two or three

339
00:34:11.20 --> 00:34:17.60
hours of continuous hills, bogs, rocks, holes in the ground, everything that we could possibly,

340
00:34:17.60 --> 00:34:23.36
everything that could possibly make you trip or get wet. On top of the bloody awful terrain,

341
00:34:23.36 --> 00:34:30.16
we had the rain, sleet, wind and freezing climate to cope with. Exhausted and near the point of

342
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:36.56
collapse, we came to the first man-made thing I'd seen, apart from the small houses at San Carlos.

343
00:34:36.56 --> 00:34:41.12
It was a barbed wire fence. There, right in the middle of nowhere, sat the fence,

344
00:34:41.12 --> 00:34:46.88
stretching far into the darkness on either side. Orders from above, told us to rest up until first

345
00:34:46.88 --> 00:34:51.20
light. We had been marching for 15 hours across the worst terrain you could imagine.

346
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.04
Stephen, I attached our poncho with bunges, our ponchos with bunges to the fence and skitty,

347
00:34:59.04 --> 00:35:04.16
cave and johnny bashed up on the other side, creating a tent like accommodation. That's like

348
00:35:04.16 --> 00:35:10.56
their term for making shelter. We'd call it Bivvy Up, which is where we're going to sleep. They

349
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:17.04
call it Bashed Up. We'd say Bivvy Up, here. We're going to Bivvy Up here. The rain hard for

350
00:35:17.04 --> 00:35:23.04
the remaining four hours of darkness. The wind blew the rain in on us as we all lay there trying

351
00:35:23.04 --> 00:35:29.68
to rest in the Bashar. But although we were exhausted, someone snoring, soon broken to my thoughts

352
00:35:29.68 --> 00:35:34.80
and outside around the Bashar little whispers could be heard, and other voices shouting for silence.

353
00:35:36.08 --> 00:35:41.28
I closed my eyes dreaming of a bath, clean sheets, and a letter from home. I didn't mind the

354
00:35:41.28 --> 00:35:46.000
rain as it hit my face. The chance to rest was welcome and I eventually managed to sleep.

355
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:51.12
I was a woken by a nudge from skitty, who was already half packed and ready to move.

356
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:56.24
Steve and I crawled from our refuge and quietly packed our kit into our webbing.

357
00:35:57.12 --> 00:36:01.44
The rain and cold had shrunk the webbing so that it was difficult to fasten.

358
00:36:02.80 --> 00:36:09.92
Cold and numbness had us swearing out loud. We tapped over more hills,

359
00:36:10.88 --> 00:36:17.52
through more bogs and marshes. My legs ached more than I had fought possible. Steve was,

360
00:36:17.52 --> 00:36:23.52
if anything, better than me with the weight. Every time I started to struggle with the GPMG,

361
00:36:23.52 --> 00:36:27.60
he took it without complaining. Kary that weapon he could.

362
00:36:29.84 --> 00:36:36.16
So brutal march, they get to their next destination where they're going into a lay-up point or a

363
00:36:36.16 --> 00:36:40.64
perimeter where they're going to stop for a while. Back to the book, my stomach felt hollow.

364
00:36:40.64 --> 00:36:46.000
The wind and rain drain me of life. Lying there, feeling near to total exhaustion,

365
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.40
I couldn't even think of what was to come. The battle for Tiel inlet. My feet didn't exist any more.

366
00:36:52.40 --> 00:36:57.60
They were just two blocks of numbed ice attached to my legs, tapping them together, brought a

367
00:36:57.60 --> 00:37:04.000
pain that felt as if they would shatter and fall off. Steve lay next to me, lighting up a

368
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.84
fag, which is a cigarette. He looked up through the rain clouds at the dark and sky.

369
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:17.52
If we carry on at this rate, we'll all drop that of exhaustion he murmured. Steve said

370
00:37:17.52 --> 00:37:21.68
that he didn't want to look at his feet because they felt like they were falling off. I peeled

371
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:27.12
back my wet socks, saw blood on my right foot and discovered that the nail of my big toe was hanging

372
00:37:27.12 --> 00:37:33.84
off. Numbness had masked, what normally would have been agony. Cleunching my teeth, I pulled the nail

373
00:37:33.84 --> 00:37:44.08
away by its remaining roots. Soon, the shot went out that we were to get ready to move. We

374
00:37:44.08 --> 00:37:49.04
were moving earlier than expected to catch the last of the daylight. When I stood up, my body

375
00:37:49.04 --> 00:37:55.12
ached from head to foot. I was minus one toenail. I took up my kit and moved into line with the

376
00:37:55.12 --> 00:38:02.32
others ready to go the last 13 kilometers to Tiel. So far to take us about 14 hours to March

377
00:38:02.32 --> 00:38:11.36
40 odd kilometers. That was still good going. We set off very slowly spaced out in one long line.

378
00:38:12.08 --> 00:38:18.40
We hobbled over the hill in front of us only to see more hills and marshes. I began to become

379
00:38:18.40 --> 00:38:24.48
conscious of my toe and the more I thought about it, the worse it felt. However, the thought of

380
00:38:24.48 --> 00:38:31.52
dropping out at that stage seemed to fate worse than death and so I fought the pain. It's funny,

381
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:37.20
looking back, but the further we went into the campaign, the less I thought of my home or family.

382
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.72
I wasn't thinking of Queen and Country either. I fought of myself and the lads around me.

383
00:38:45.76 --> 00:38:51.28
Letting the side down was my biggest fear. That fear kept me walking.

384
00:38:55.36 --> 00:38:56.96
Just doesn't want to let his boys down.

385
00:38:56.96 --> 00:39:02.88
That's his driving force, not even thinking about his family anymore. Not thinking about God and

386
00:39:02.88 --> 00:39:05.52
Country. Not thinking about the Queen.

387
00:39:09.36 --> 00:39:14.08
Here's a little thing that I had to highlight. We were annoyed by the lack of info coming down the

388
00:39:14.08 --> 00:39:19.60
marching line to Tielus where we were and how far we had left the march. This is as the last

389
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:26.08
night learned a long time ago. When I was a young junior guy in a pontoon and if you're in the

390
00:39:26.08 --> 00:39:28.96
back of the pontoon or you're in the back of the patrol and you don't know where you're going,

391
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:33.52
it is the worst feeling. It's the worst feeling. You have no idea how much longer, where you're

392
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:40.08
going, where you are. Not only is it a bad feeling for the people on your team. It's tactically

393
00:39:40.08 --> 00:39:43.84
unsound because they don't know where they are. What happens if you get contact, you get split up,

394
00:39:43.84 --> 00:39:46.40
where they're supposed to go, they don't even know where they're. What if they're going the wrong

395
00:39:46.40 --> 00:39:51.44
directions? They could get going to enemy formation. It's a horrible scenario.

396
00:39:51.44 --> 00:39:58.16
Obviously, as a leader in any position, you gotta think, does the back of your patrol know where

397
00:39:58.16 --> 00:40:02.72
you are? Does your company know where you are? I was working with a company recently. They had

398
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:10.000
that big transition to make. No one knew what quantified that transition. It just seemed like this

399
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.64
open-ended prospect and no one knew where it ended or what quantified, hey, we can move to the next phase.

400
00:40:18.64 --> 00:40:24.64
It was a tough phase that they were going through. Cutting costs and being restrictive on

401
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:29.92
expenditures, I guess that is cutting costs, but getting rid of some people is a tough time.

402
00:40:31.04 --> 00:40:36.08
But no one knew when that was going to end. They knew that there was some kind of go-off

403
00:40:36.08 --> 00:40:40.40
there, but they didn't know what it was. That was really tough for them in the transition.

404
00:40:40.40 --> 00:40:44.96
I said, you need to set clear goals. If you know what they are, which is actually the leadership

405
00:40:44.96 --> 00:40:49.04
did know, they knew there was a certain line, a certain amount of costs that they needed to cut

406
00:40:49.04 --> 00:40:54.88
a certain operating expense that they needed to get down to, but they didn't tell anybody.

407
00:40:55.60 --> 00:40:59.28
So everyone just thought, well, we might just be cutting my job next or who, you know,

408
00:40:59.28 --> 00:41:04.16
how long am I going to be here? If we're just shutting down, I don't know. So keep your people

409
00:41:04.16 --> 00:41:08.32
informed. The people that are in the back end of your patrol, you gotta keep them informed.

410
00:41:10.32 --> 00:41:14.88
Back to the book, we came to a fourth river smaller than the rest and stumbled across

411
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:20.48
it in the dark. The cold water mixed with our sweat to cause yet more sores on our feet.

412
00:41:21.60 --> 00:41:25.60
We were now about one and a half kilometers from the settlement of Tiel inlet.

413
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:31.84
The agony of the marching disappeared quickly as it became clear that the task of the battle

414
00:41:31.84 --> 00:41:33.36
would soon confront us.

415
00:41:35.76 --> 00:41:41.68
And how does that go? One and a half hours of lying in the cold with the wind shooting through us

416
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:45.84
was all the action they had that night. So they get to Tiel and Lett and really nothing really

417
00:41:45.84 --> 00:41:53.52
happens because the RGs had left. They do get some updates. Back to the book, we found out that

418
00:41:53.52 --> 00:41:58.80
some of the platoon had dropped out on the march. More importantly, though, Mick Coleman, one of our

419
00:41:58.80 --> 00:42:07.84
gunners had just been shot in the leg, not by the enemy, but by a knob in a company. So their first,

420
00:42:07.84 --> 00:42:12.72
you know, casualty besides someone getting hurt from marching is something that gets shot,

421
00:42:12.72 --> 00:42:18.80
one of my one of their own people. It's a knob just in a derogatory term for a tool.

422
00:42:20.64 --> 00:42:29.52
A turtleneck. It's not a military turn. It's not a official military

423
00:42:29.52 --> 00:42:40.08
doctrinal term knob. Just say a turt. The CO and his back to the book. The CO and his band of

424
00:42:40.08 --> 00:42:44.96
followers and spectatilines later that morning. So now they're dug in another position. We thought

425
00:42:44.96 --> 00:42:49.84
they might instruct us to move our trench or something. The usual thing, but we were still thinking

426
00:42:49.84 --> 00:42:54.24
is that we were on exercise. So classic point right there, the commanding officer comes around and

427
00:42:54.24 --> 00:42:57.20
they think, oh, he's going to tell us to redig these trenches because that's what we'd be doing

428
00:42:57.20 --> 00:43:00.48
if we were on exercise. Hey, you need to move this over here. That could be a little bit better.

429
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:07.76
It doesn't do any of that. The CO looked grim as he approached the six of us taking a tea break.

430
00:43:09.12 --> 00:43:16.40
Listen in lads said the RSM. That's the regimental sergeant major. We looked at him wondering what was

431
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:23.12
coming. During the March, two parrots. So that's their sister battalion. Two parrots attacked

432
00:43:23.12 --> 00:43:30.32
goose green and Darwin settlements. After a long battle, the regiment liberated the settlement

433
00:43:30.32 --> 00:43:36.24
with the loss of 18 lives, including their commanding officer Colonel H Jones.

434
00:43:37.92 --> 00:43:43.84
Many have been wounded and a casualty list is being drawn up. They captured hundreds of

435
00:43:43.84 --> 00:43:50.56
arches. The war is now a different concept for the enemy are believed to have shot down members of

436
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:57.04
two parrots showing a white flag. More information will be given once known.

437
00:43:59.04 --> 00:44:03.92
The CO have smiled and proceeded to the next line of partly dubbed trenches.

438
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.40
Skitty, Kev, John and I looked at each other with open mouths.

439
00:44:11.84 --> 00:44:16.56
The fought of 18 members of two parrots dead outweighed the victory for us.

440
00:44:16.56 --> 00:44:24.56
I for one couldn't have given a shit about goose green or anywhere else on the island at that time.

441
00:44:26.32 --> 00:44:30.32
It was a thought of losing our mates in the sister battalion that worried me.

442
00:44:33.20 --> 00:44:40.000
So they think they've got it bad. But this other battalion had been an a serious gunfight

443
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.12
and taken some pretty significant casualties including losing their leader, the leader of the battalion.

444
00:44:53.68 --> 00:44:57.60
Back to the book, the condition of our feet was becoming a major problem for the battalion.

445
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:04.08
An old complaint suffered by troops during many wars was afflicting us in modern war,

446
00:45:04.08 --> 00:45:11.60
trench foot. Our boots, badly and cheaply made coupled with our old fashioned socks and putties

447
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:18.88
caused this condition and putties are like, let me have you ever seen those old kind of school

448
00:45:18.88 --> 00:45:25.84
world war one. They're like leggings or like gators. No gators are. They kind of cover your shoes.

449
00:45:25.84 --> 00:45:33.36
They kind of cover your boots. It was characterized by a dull, fumping ache all over the

450
00:45:33.36 --> 00:45:39.76
foot with blueness at the edges. Some say it's similar to frostbite, which some lads also got.

451
00:45:43.36 --> 00:45:51.12
Now they hold up for the night and then as he's sleeping, we get this corpal bee corpal bee.

452
00:45:51.12 --> 00:45:54.72
That's who we're talking about right now. That's Vince, Vince Bramley,

453
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:59.44
he's the column corpal bee a bunch. Corpal bee a voice whispered into the trench.

454
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:05.04
Steve and I came around together. I looked up to see four platoons officer looking down at me.

455
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:11.36
Yes, sir, I replied. Vince isn't it? Yes, sir. Being asked your first name wasn't unusual

456
00:46:11.36 --> 00:46:16.80
between officers and men in the field. Sorry old boy, bad news for you. In my half sleep,

457
00:46:16.80 --> 00:46:21.20
I couldn't think of anything worse than being woken up. Or just from the boss. We're pulling

458
00:46:21.20 --> 00:46:27.92
out at first light and marching to a stansia. He said, a stansia, where the fuck is that I asked?

459
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:33.84
It was another 30 to 50 kilometers away towards Stanley. We learned. Stanley again is the capital.

460
00:46:34.72 --> 00:46:39.36
Steve and I looked at each other. As we sat, the bottom of our trench too numb to speak.

461
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.48
I broke the silence first. This is getting fucking stupid, Steve. March here, dig there. We're dropping

462
00:46:46.48 --> 00:46:54.48
down like flies and now more. Do we're die marching without resting? Steve started laughing at my

463
00:46:54.48 --> 00:47:00.40
morning. His teeth shining in the dark. What are you so happy about? I said, just thought of

464
00:47:00.40 --> 00:47:07.28
more pain for the cause. Pain. Jesus, he was right. My feet would die before me. I thought,

465
00:47:08.32 --> 00:47:13.36
as I drifted back to sleep, I thought of my old corporal who trained me,

466
00:47:13.36 --> 00:47:19.60
corporal daring. We hated him for his hard methods. He used to say, pain doesn't matter. The mine

467
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:27.52
does the work. He was right. So right. His voice was screaming in my ears now four years later.

468
00:47:27.52 --> 00:47:32.88
It was going to be mind over matter. There is wisdom in the pair's training method.

469
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:39.68
Methods. I thought briefly of my parents who over the years had had a rough time with my

470
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:44.80
slobbish attitude. I had been in and out of all sorts of trouble before joining the army.

471
00:47:44.80 --> 00:47:49.60
I said to myself that if I died with a bullet in the head, at least it would be better than

472
00:47:49.60 --> 00:47:55.60
worrying them into an early grave with my attitude. But to drop out now and be branded a

473
00:47:55.60 --> 00:48:04.000
wanker would be unbearable. I owe a lot to everyone. My old NCO, my parents, and above all,

474
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.60
to the lads around me. A pair of team cannot work without everyone giving their best.

475
00:48:09.60 --> 00:48:15.20
It's the lads you fight and work for. You come second.

476
00:48:21.84 --> 00:48:29.84
So obviously more patrolling, more boots, boots, boots, over the Falkland Islands,

477
00:48:29.84 --> 00:48:36.88
another 30 kilometers up and down, crappy terrain. Back to the book. We are now within the

478
00:48:36.88 --> 00:48:42.88
enemies artillery range. The CO has ordered that we will dig shell scraps for protection.

479
00:48:43.60 --> 00:48:48.88
No movement like walking around, etc. until ordered tomorrow. So now they're within

480
00:48:49.52 --> 00:48:56.08
enemy artillery range, which we don't like artillery around here. Not when it's coming towards us at

481
00:48:56.08 --> 00:49:04.000
least. They're taking a look at each other, seeing where they're at. Steven Tom will look to my

482
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.20
feet wondering if I would be able to carry on. I found a bandage hidden in my webbing and

483
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:15.60
cut it up to make small dressings for my blisters and toes. I thought the fresh air would do them

484
00:49:15.60 --> 00:49:23.36
help. Leaving my boots off that night was by leaving my boots off that night was to be my worst

485
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:29.68
mistake so far. After a freezing cold and sleepless night, the morning light showed me

486
00:49:29.68 --> 00:49:37.28
two swollen feet and the hardest frozen pair of boots imaginable. Putting those boots back on

487
00:49:37.28 --> 00:49:44.56
was agony. We marched for about four hours until the whole battalion and rendezvoused.

488
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:52.16
By the time we reached this point, I was nearly crying in pain. My hips had bad webbing burns

489
00:49:52.16 --> 00:50:00.72
and my feet were too raw blobs as I slumped against a peak, a peat bank, Jimmy Morham murmured

490
00:50:00.72 --> 00:50:10.16
that I looked like death warmed up. I felt like it too. Within two weeks, we looked like a

491
00:50:10.16 --> 00:50:16.24
ragged bone army. Our faces were drawn with a loss of weight. Our uniforms matted and soaked.

492
00:50:16.24 --> 00:50:22.08
Our boots were damaged and we were hungry for solid food. Despite all this, Morau was very

493
00:50:22.08 --> 00:50:28.48
high in the reassuring knowledge that we had marched and taken most of the island without a bottle

494
00:50:28.48 --> 00:50:33.36
or a loss of life so far. So they're making rapid progress. And they're not really coming

495
00:50:33.36 --> 00:50:37.28
up against the enemy. The enemies were treating it. Every time they roll into a place, they find

496
00:50:37.28 --> 00:50:41.28
remnants of where the enemy was or when they have intelligence that was the enemy was there,

497
00:50:41.28 --> 00:50:45.20
but the enemy is just leaving. So it's just them against nature. That's where it's been for the

498
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:53.68
most part at this point. They keep pumping. We shuffled together and we were informed that we

499
00:50:53.68 --> 00:51:00.48
would be marching straight onto Mount Longden that night. The battle was about to begin. So this

500
00:51:00.48 --> 00:51:06.96
is a prominent piece of terrain called Mount Longden. We had no time for last letters or anything else.

501
00:51:07.68 --> 00:51:13.44
We packed our kit and were briefed and ready to go within two hours. The battalion formed up

502
00:51:13.44 --> 00:51:18.80
and marched uphill again, spilling out of the settlement towards the summit of Estancia.

503
00:51:19.92 --> 00:51:25.52
The route we took was atrocious. We crossed a rock field of some sort. The rocks were sharp and

504
00:51:25.52 --> 00:51:32.08
jagged. In four hours, we only covered three kilometers. Sweat ran down us like water. I stopped

505
00:51:32.08 --> 00:51:39.60
the one stage to take off my soaking long jones. We came to hold as the order turned back,

506
00:51:39.60 --> 00:51:46.08
turned back, hit our ears. What's the fucking matter now someone shouted? Just turn back and do as

507
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:51.20
your told screamed in officer. Just on the other side of the hill, out of the view of Stanley, which

508
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:58.08
is the capital, allowed the lads had been ordered back. Why? Shortly after, we learned that the

509
00:51:58.08 --> 00:52:02.48
cabbage heads. So they called, that's the Marines and there's Marines, Rome, Marines are down

510
00:52:02.48 --> 00:52:10.16
there working and running some of the major operations and they call them cabbage heads. Shortly after

511
00:52:10.16 --> 00:52:14.32
we learned that the cabbage heads were running the show, hadn't agreed to our advance. They didn't

512
00:52:14.32 --> 00:52:18.88
think we should take the risk of going into battle on our own. So the Marines wanted to be there.

513
00:52:18.88 --> 00:52:29.20
With them, so they said, don't go to long to yet. Back to the book, as we were milling around a

514
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:35.76
peat fire with nine squadron, a chopper came down from one of the mountains. Some nosy lads ran

515
00:52:35.76 --> 00:52:40.56
towards an quickly brought back report that some Marines had been in a blue on blue contact that

516
00:52:40.56 --> 00:52:46.64
night. So another blue on blue, a returning patrol had stumbled upon a mortar-based team of sleep

517
00:52:47.68 --> 00:52:53.28
and it shot them as they lay in their sleeping bags. There were three to four dead.

518
00:52:53.28 --> 00:53:02.16
Whatever we felt about the Marines, we were sorry for them on that day. If you're out there

519
00:53:02.16 --> 00:53:07.44
and you use a gun for part of your job, whether you're in the police department, whether you're

520
00:53:07.44 --> 00:53:13.36
in a SWAT team, whether you're in the military, I'm telling you the blue on blue happens

521
00:53:14.32 --> 00:53:20.64
and you gotta do all you can to train for situations and always be aware that it can happen.

522
00:53:20.64 --> 00:53:27.44
People don't think it can happen. That's why it happens. Back to the book on 10 June, we had orders

523
00:53:27.44 --> 00:53:33.60
that something was going down soon. We stripped our weapons thoroughly, oil and oil,

524
00:53:33.60 --> 00:53:42.08
and greased them. The PC issued 50 rounds per gun for balancing. That's basically test firing

525
00:53:42.08 --> 00:53:47.20
and probably doing some kind of a timing drill on your weapon to make sure that it's good to go.

526
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:53.12
Bob Gettison immediately balanced his gun by firing across the water, inlet into the sea.

527
00:53:53.12 --> 00:53:57.60
Tony Jones was just setting up his when the QM, that's a quarter-master guy in charge of

528
00:53:57.60 --> 00:54:01.84
supplies and logistics, came screaming over and ordered us not to waste ammo.

529
00:54:02.56 --> 00:54:07.60
We pointed out that the guns needed balancing, but his narrow mind wouldn't have it.

530
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:13.60
He walked away pleased by the thought of saving ammo. In fact, he caused a major

531
00:54:13.60 --> 00:54:20.96
fuck up with all the guns in the battle. Only two of the six worked. 50 rounds through each might

532
00:54:20.96 --> 00:54:25.20
have saved lives and would have at least provided better firepower for the battalion.

533
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:34.08
So you gotta guy, the supply guy, hey don't, don't test fire your weapons. Don't do that right now.

534
00:54:34.08 --> 00:54:38.32
Save the ammunition. Now they did realize that they were an ammunition shortage. That was going to be a

535
00:54:38.32 --> 00:54:45.60
problem, but you're not going to have an ammunition shortage if your guns don't work. Back to the

536
00:54:45.60 --> 00:54:50.96
book, the PC came down and we gathered round him eagerly. He stood faintly, grinning at us.

537
00:54:52.08 --> 00:54:57.76
Spitted out Sir, said Johnny Cook orders in a half an hour, tonight lads, green light.

538
00:54:58.40 --> 00:55:04.16
See you by the model in a half an hour. So, they're in the model. He's talking about they built

539
00:55:04.16 --> 00:55:11.44
a little terrain model so that they could kind of draw out where everyone's going, kind of go through

540
00:55:11.44 --> 00:55:18.48
the plan. And this is what they're talking about now is the assault on Mount Longden, which is about

541
00:55:18.48 --> 00:55:28.32
to begin. Begins with getting into position and finally they are in position. The assault

542
00:55:28.32 --> 00:55:33.84
is getting started. Things start going sideways pretty damn quickly. Back to the book. We tend

543
00:55:33.84 --> 00:55:38.56
Oliver rushed over to our position. Right, listen in he said, I felt like saying I was anyway,

544
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:43.44
but for the time joking was over. Be company of had to change their tactics a bit.

545
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:50.48
Corporals, Bramlies and Cook's teams will follow myself and Captain Mason into A company positions.

546
00:55:50.48 --> 00:55:58.32
While Corporal Tomo, Rawlings and Pears will go to another task. Okay, so things are going crazy.

547
00:55:58.32 --> 00:56:05.28
They start to move. He starts to move with Lieutenant Oliver towards this other position. Back to

548
00:56:05.28 --> 00:56:10.000
the book. We'd run about 200 meters. We were all still together, but now the run had become a fast

549
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.68
stumbling walk. The noise of battle continued to grow. Continue to our right now as we moved around

550
00:56:15.68 --> 00:56:21.28
the slope. Suddenly a zipping sound whipped across my face. I didn't think anything of it as I walked

551
00:56:21.28 --> 00:56:27.52
and stumbled to keep up. Then three or four more zips hit the ground in front of in front and

552
00:56:27.52 --> 00:56:34.24
at my feet. I still carry on. I was walking behind Lieutenant Oliver. As I was walking behind Lieutenant

553
00:56:34.24 --> 00:56:40.16
Oliver, we saw bodies lying all over the place. I thought what the fuck are they doing lying there?

554
00:56:40.16 --> 00:56:47.12
Jesus Christ fucking lying there and we're struggling. I saw lad kneeling over a guy in a sleeping bag.

555
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:53.44
I remember as I got to them just watching him. A low moaning was coming from the sleeping bag.

556
00:56:53.44 --> 00:57:00.56
I'd gone about 20 pieces when several more zips hit the ground sending a small shockwave all around me.

557
00:57:01.76 --> 00:57:06.40
For fuck's sake are you completely nuts or what some guy shouted? What?

558
00:57:06.40 --> 00:57:12.24
Ask Lieutenant Oliver. Do you know a sniper's picking at us? We stopped frozen solid in our

559
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:17.36
trucks, then filled the ground. Our small column now joining the bodies lying all over the place.

560
00:57:17.36 --> 00:57:23.28
We'd walked into a company's form up where they had been stopped by a sniper.

561
00:57:24.32 --> 00:57:29.36
Lying there and hit me like a sledgehammer. The zips had been that had been missing me by inches.

562
00:57:30.64 --> 00:57:35.12
They were sniper fire. I lay there thinking you fucking idiot Vince.

563
00:57:36.24 --> 00:57:42.88
I cursed myself all the time. We lay there blaming myself for an unprofessional act. But then I'd never been

564
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:48.16
shot at before. My mind had been so occupied with moving that the zipping sound seemed

565
00:57:48.16 --> 00:57:55.68
unconnected with the battle. So like I said first time being shot at and he didn't know what it was.

566
00:57:56.24 --> 00:57:58.80
I told this story on here before. The first time I got shot at,

567
00:57:58.80 --> 00:58:02.16
well the first time I was receiving fire was in the rum piece and I thought someone was going

568
00:58:02.16 --> 00:58:05.76
to cigarette out onto the road. I was like who the hell smoking in that home via enemy? But it was

569
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:10.72
rounds hitting the Humvee. I was the same way. I was just like didn't it didn't occur to me.

570
00:58:10.72 --> 00:58:17.44
When it hit to you that their bullets are you like in shock or or do you just kind of shift into

571
00:58:17.44 --> 00:58:23.84
you know. Yeah, it's a game time. But it took me. It wasn't it was a pretty slow transition.

572
00:58:24.40 --> 00:58:30.64
You know, it took me to think through the whole process of who's smoking a cigarette.

573
00:58:30.64 --> 00:58:34.08
Wait, why are they throwing cigarettes? Wait, why do they have so many cigarettes?

574
00:58:34.08 --> 00:58:38.08
Where's the entire Humvee smoking a cigarette and putting them all out right now?

575
00:58:38.08 --> 00:58:42.16
And it wasn't like a massive volume of fire, but it was rounds hitting.

576
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:47.20
Well, yeah. Can be won. Yeah, that's the answer. Wait, so you saw it on another Humvee in

577
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:52.96
front of the Sparks. Yeah, I saw the Sparks on the ship. I thought. Yeah, so what's going on?

578
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:57.44
Why someone's throwing cigarettes? Same same thing. I will say this though.

579
00:58:57.44 --> 00:59:00.24
When the first time I got shot at when I wasn't in the vehicle,

580
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:06.56
you I heard the rounds going over and I knew what it was because I was used to it from when we do

581
00:59:06.56 --> 00:59:13.12
butts, I don't know how I'll explain it. When you shoot on a range, like when you go sight in your rifle,

582
00:59:13.12 --> 00:59:19.60
you shoot on the range and and some of us guys, you go down and you work the targets for the other

583
00:59:19.60 --> 00:59:24.88
guys. So you're in basically in a bunker kind of or you behind a big berm. Yeah. And you put the

584
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.52
target up for your guys and then when they shoot at, you pull it back down, you mark it with these

585
00:59:29.52 --> 00:59:32.72
discs so that they know where their shots it so they can make adjustments and you put it back

586
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:38.000
up again. So when you're doing that and you do it at different distances, they shoot from different

587
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
distances, they shoot from 100 yards and they shoot from 300 yards and they shoot from 500 yards and

588
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.08
they shoot from 800 yards. So you can just hear all these different ones and the further out they get

589
00:59:46.80 --> 00:59:52.24
the more you hear the actual sound of the round going over you. Right. And at certain ranges,

590
00:59:52.24 --> 00:59:57.76
you can hear a breaking the sound barrier and it's pretty loud. It's a crack more, but then when they

591
00:59:57.76 --> 01:00:03.28
get far enough away, you don't hear that anymore and it just sounds like he's talking about like a

592
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:08.96
little zip, like a little, you know, but I knew it was the first time I ever got shot at,

593
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:13.44
I knew exactly what it was. Yeah. It's crazy. I knew what was good. Well, that's the first time I got

594
01:00:13.44 --> 01:00:18.56
shot at not in a humbry. Right. And then in a humbry. Which by the way, I got shot at first. That was

595
01:00:18.56 --> 01:00:24.48
the first time I ever got shot at. Was it in the humbry? Yeah. All right, going back to the book,

596
01:00:24.48 --> 01:00:30.96
the battle was raging on the hill. Artillery shells were landing there, adding to the ricochet of bullets.

597
01:00:31.68 --> 01:00:36.16
If you slowly raised your head, you could watch the free firework display because that's what it

598
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:41.04
looked like. The odd shout could be heard and the odd scream, but it was the sound of rifle

599
01:00:41.04 --> 01:00:45.84
machine gun and artillery that dominated the night. So we've gone from hay we're out on patrol and we're

600
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:52.24
looking now they're in full. There's a full battle going on. After about an hour, we were all getting

601
01:00:52.24 --> 01:00:57.76
pissed off with this fucking sniper. Something had to be done and quick. He was holding up 130

602
01:00:57.76 --> 01:01:03.60
months. So these guys are pinned down. They're pinned down. And the idea was finding the plan that

603
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:09.12
they come up with is they're going to use a malond called a malond. It's like a short range kind of

604
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.28
it's like a bazooka, but it's wire guided so you can actually steer it a little bit. It's a missile,

605
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:21.04
a little hand-carried missile. And that's the plan is to use that to shoot from where they think this

606
01:01:21.04 --> 01:01:24.56
sniper is shooting from. So they get in position, they get them malond in position, and then they're

607
01:01:24.56 --> 01:01:27.76
going to once they shoot with them malond, they're going to shoot their machine guns and add it.

608
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:35.20
Stand by shouted captain Mason. My feet were forgotten. My mind empty to many thoughts,

609
01:01:35.20 --> 01:01:39.12
but my eyes were completely alive staring at the area of the fin. He's talking about this

610
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:44.80
terrain feature that looks like a shark fin and possible target. Fire.

611
01:01:44.80 --> 01:01:51.28
Ginge let off the malond. The rocket rushed off the small portable frame and picked up

612
01:01:51.28 --> 01:01:58.48
its deadly speed. After 120 meters it was at its deadliest. We were only about 90 meters from the target.

613
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:03.36
By the way, if you're sniper shooting at you from 90 meters, that is scary. He's not missing.

614
01:02:04.96 --> 01:02:09.84
Ginge managed to guide the wire missile to wire guide the missile on target.

615
01:02:09.84 --> 01:02:14.72
The explosion ripped into the night sending sparks everywhere. Bob pressed the trigger and

616
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:21.20
are gunned burst to life for a few seconds. Then stopped. Stop it, screamed Bob. I tried to lift the

617
01:02:21.20 --> 01:02:28.56
feed the cover off the top of the GPMG, but the night sight was in the way. I ripped off the night

618
01:02:28.56 --> 01:02:33.60
sight from the weapon and threw it into sass's hands. It's another guy's sass. I cleared the gun

619
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:38.64
and reloaded. Bob was just about to fire again when a zipping sound ripped into the ground right

620
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:44.08
in front of our tripod. We both ducked behind the bank. The enemy's bullets whist over our heads

621
01:02:44.08 --> 01:02:49.76
and all around us. Ginge was laughing and shouted. They've seen you all right. Fucking brilliant

622
01:02:49.76 --> 01:02:56.000
isn't it? My night and the bloody guns packed up. Captain Mason shouted over from behind us.

623
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.12
Reload. Reload. CS9 wants another one up there. So they wanted to hit again. We'll hit that sniper

624
01:03:03.12 --> 01:03:12.72
position to get with a me on which they do and they eventually take care of that problem and

625
01:03:12.72 --> 01:03:22.72
and are able to move on. Now they start coming back down from that supporting position because

626
01:03:22.72 --> 01:03:26.32
that's what they're doing is the most part they're assigned into supporting positions to get the

627
01:03:26.32 --> 01:03:31.04
high ground and support the assaultes they're happening. They come back down from that. We reach the

628
01:03:31.04 --> 01:03:37.68
bottom of the hill at about zero zero three zero hours. The battle had been going for some three

629
01:03:37.68 --> 01:03:42.80
and a half hours. We came up to the FAP. That's our first aid post and walk past the line of

630
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:49.04
guys lying there moaning in half silence. The medics were busy with all the wounded. They're

631
01:03:49.04 --> 01:03:54.96
seem to be about 25 guys working and wounded in the group. We were sitting some 20 meters from them

632
01:03:54.96 --> 01:04:00.32
in the darkness and we could only just see the scene by the light of the moon. A sergeant from

633
01:04:00.32 --> 01:04:05.84
batalion HQ came over and told came over to us and they sent it all over and Captain Mason stood

634
01:04:05.84 --> 01:04:12.48
up to meet him. We have three confirmed dead at this moment. He said Murdock, Scott, and Greenwood.

635
01:04:13.44 --> 01:04:17.68
We know that are more but we can't get to them as yet. So Murdock, if you remember the guy that was

636
01:04:17.68 --> 01:04:24.16
making fun of making funny faces when they were on the boat coming in, confirmed dead. Their conversation

637
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:32.24
continued around our coming task and that the RSM was coming to meet us. I sat in a trance. I

638
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:38.24
couldn't believe that we had lost guys. Today it seems crazy that I should think like this. Why?

639
01:04:38.24 --> 01:04:42.72
I can only put it down to the fact that I was still in my own little world of make believe.

640
01:04:42.72 --> 01:04:48.88
We would win the war without getting anyone killed. The death of those three guys hit me like a brick

641
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:56.80
total shock. Murdock were simply docked. docked who I'd been chatting with on the way to our

642
01:04:56.80 --> 01:05:04.000
start line after we bumped into B company now dead. Scotty from the MT Platoon. That's the motor

643
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.56
transport Platoon. Like Greenwood recently nicknamed Fester because of his sleeping habits.

644
01:05:11.44 --> 01:05:17.28
My mind was blank to the conversation around me. Johnny nudged me. Vence were moving mate.

645
01:05:17.28 --> 01:05:24.08
This woke me to the reality of it all. I was now fully alert for Shirley that it was more to come.

646
01:05:26.08 --> 01:05:30.08
So now they're getting to another, like I said, their job has been doing supporting

647
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:34.16
supporting arms, which is basically covering move on a big scale. That's what they're doing. You

648
01:05:34.16 --> 01:05:39.44
got to a group. This machine gun, Platoon, with the Milan, with the heavy machine guns,

649
01:05:39.44 --> 01:05:44.80
they're getting into elevated positions to cover for another element, another company, or another

650
01:05:44.80 --> 01:05:49.60
battalion to go in an assault target. This is classic cover move situation and they're in the

651
01:05:49.60 --> 01:05:54.72
cover position in most of these situations. And that's what's going on where we come back to the

652
01:05:54.72 --> 01:05:59.04
book. They're in another elevated firing position back to the book. Corporal B get ready.

653
01:06:00.24 --> 01:06:05.52
I waited for the command sergeant major to give the orders to fire. The weight was longer than I

654
01:06:05.52 --> 01:06:11.52
expected in my fingers stayed on the trigger frozen waiting. As I sat waiting for the command,

655
01:06:11.52 --> 01:06:17.20
other voices came to my ears from among the sounds of battle. The voices of the wounded.

656
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:23.68
Everywhere their cries pitched in with those survivors still struggling and screaming

657
01:06:23.68 --> 01:06:29.92
frantically at each other to move their or move here. But the wounded were unlike anything else.

658
01:06:31.12 --> 01:06:35.76
Their cries could be heard above the uningered. Their shouts were desperate.

659
01:06:35.76 --> 01:06:41.20
My mind went blank. My eyes were wide open with fright for them.

660
01:06:42.56 --> 01:06:49.84
My mouth dried as I lay there. The second seemed like hours. Their anguished moaning and crying

661
01:06:49.84 --> 01:06:57.84
is here in my ears now as I write. No matter what eye or others did to try and ignore them,

662
01:06:57.84 --> 01:07:06.96
they somehow grew seemed to grow louder and louder. I burned with frustration. One victim

663
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:12.32
who I later found out was bads bare it. Seems so near, groaning and shouting,

664
01:07:12.32 --> 01:07:16.80
help me, please don't leave me. For fuck's sake help, I can't move.

665
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:24.40
Someone further along to our left called out for Christ's sake, I'm dying. Don't let them

666
01:07:24.40 --> 01:07:33.76
bury me here, please, please. I shouted out. Hang on, don't move, don't move. For fuck's sake,

667
01:07:33.76 --> 01:07:39.12
keep quiet. I started to crawl from my position. I wanted to help them.

668
01:07:41.12 --> 01:07:46.88
But to come and regret my arm. Leave it, corporal be. Leave it.

669
01:07:46.88 --> 01:07:55.76
I looked at him. Why? Because a sniper has already picked off about five or six guys that have

670
01:07:55.76 --> 01:08:04.72
tried to help, the top says no more. Okay? I slumped to the ground with a feeling of total helplessness.

671
01:08:05.84 --> 01:08:11.12
It was the worst feeling that anyone can imagine. As I tried not to think it was real,

672
01:08:11.12 --> 01:08:19.36
the cries continued. Oh God, I'm hitting the chest. I'm all wet. Please help.

673
01:08:20.88 --> 01:08:28.88
The crying went on and on. Some wounded guys had been dragged or had crawled away from the main

674
01:08:28.88 --> 01:08:35.20
impact area. Only to be pinned down elsewhere. My mind's seeth with anger.

675
01:08:35.20 --> 01:08:46.56
Corporal be, stand by the CSM screamed. The command to follow killed off all the cries and

676
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:52.80
moaning. The weapon broke a stream of fire at the Argentinian positions three to five rounds

677
01:08:52.80 --> 01:08:59.20
bursting across the summit. The steady rate of fire continued as the CSM shouted across to change

678
01:08:59.20 --> 01:09:05.12
direction using our tracer rounds as indicators. All six guns opened up. Our tracers were

679
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:09.84
ripped across the summit to the other end of the mountain. The bullets bouncing and ricocheting in all

680
01:09:09.84 --> 01:09:23.92
directions. So hammering the target, hammering the enemy from where the enemy is shooting and

681
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:30.72
obviously, I mean, what a wretched description of being within the sound of the voices of your wounded

682
01:09:30.72 --> 01:09:40.08
man who you cannot help because they're pinned down by snipers. Eventually, they

683
01:09:41.52 --> 01:09:44.88
this, I mean, this goes on for a long time. They're in the supporting position. They're laying

684
01:09:44.88 --> 01:09:50.24
down five or shooting thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds. Back to the book,

685
01:09:50.24 --> 01:09:56.64
the CSM shouted, stop, stop. War now, we rested our heads on the ground.

686
01:09:56.64 --> 01:10:06.32
The battle had now been going on for some 11 hours. How long we had laid their firing? I did not

687
01:10:06.32 --> 01:10:16.24
know the CSM came over well done. A company are moving through to our left now. We've covered

688
01:10:16.24 --> 01:10:21.92
them and given them all the help we could give. The rest is up to them. We can't fire anymore.

689
01:10:21.92 --> 01:10:28.88
It get to them. It's too close now. It'll be light in an hour or so. Pull the gun back and dismount it.

690
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:35.92
Surred did we get any ass bob? More than enough he replied and walked away.

691
01:10:37.20 --> 01:10:47.20
Had we killed? We must have. I felt nothing afterwards. Just relaxed. I hadn't seen our targets.

692
01:10:47.20 --> 01:10:53.04
They had been hidden in darkness. We hadn't killed at the end of a bayonet or through a rifle site.

693
01:10:53.92 --> 01:10:59.04
We had killed with a spray of machine gun bullets. It didn't seem personal.

694
01:11:00.40 --> 01:11:03.52
It was as if the enemy hadn't existed at all.

695
01:11:03.52 --> 01:11:18.48
They complete that mission.

696
01:11:24.48 --> 01:11:29.44
They crawl back to a little bit of a covered position away from where they had been

697
01:11:29.44 --> 01:11:37.52
supporting. And then here we go back to the book about 70 meters away. The ground exploded in a

698
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:43.44
massive earth, shrapnel and rock. Then another shell came over this time further to our right.

699
01:11:43.44 --> 01:11:49.36
I looked down the hill as the shell exploded and saw an unbelievable display of flying red sparks

700
01:11:49.36 --> 01:11:56.72
dead be shrapnel. The ground shook as shell after shell fell behind us. The first minutes of

701
01:11:56.72 --> 01:12:04.72
shelling were terrifying. So they've been, this is it. Now they started. We mentioned that they

702
01:12:04.72 --> 01:12:11.12
were in artillery range and we all know what an absolute horror show artillery is.

703
01:12:13.04 --> 01:12:18.08
Back to the book and the distance a booming sound began. That carried over the area. Someone's

704
01:12:18.08 --> 01:12:24.96
screen incoming. Sure enough the air disappeared. There was a wash and the explosion killed any

705
01:12:24.96 --> 01:12:31.52
remaining piece. The shells came in thick and fast. I lay watching the red glowing shrapnel flying by.

706
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:37.52
Now the shrapnel was creeping up towards me. The explosions getting so loud I thought they would

707
01:12:37.52 --> 01:12:43.68
defen me. The shells were landing about 50 meters away. Four or five shells would hit an area in a

708
01:12:43.68 --> 01:12:50.88
salvo. Then the next batch would hit about 10 meters nearer. The booming from Stanley could still be

709
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:56.24
heard in the gaps between explosions in our areas. As I lay there watching the shrapnel getting

710
01:12:56.24 --> 01:13:03.60
closer I found myself shaking. Was it from cold or fright? My legs shook and I couldn't control

711
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:10.08
them at all. The next salvo landed 30 meters away. I curled up into a ball as the shrapnel

712
01:13:10.08 --> 01:13:17.36
splintered the rocks around me. A piece of shrapnel landed in my little alcove still burning with

713
01:13:17.36 --> 01:13:25.20
fury sizzling into the dirt by my waist. Four or five more shells landed around us and then it stopped

714
01:13:26.08 --> 01:13:33.04
as if it had never begun. The air was misty as though a fog had swept over us. I lay back praying

715
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:40.000
it was over. In the half light of the false dawn I could now hear shouting all down the hill.

716
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.28
Some guys were screaming like mad. One voice went right through me. The scream of a man who knows

717
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:55.36
he's about to die. All over the hill people were shouting medic medic. I was about to crawl

718
01:13:55.36 --> 01:14:02.08
from my hole when another shell hit the ground. I hadn't even heard it coming. I fell on my face and

719
01:14:02.08 --> 01:14:08.72
stayed there for a few seconds. Another shell landed nearby. This time a shower of dirt fell on my back.

720
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:16.48
I crawled back into my hole and crawled up again, waiting. My body shook uncontrollably.

721
01:14:17.76 --> 01:14:23.44
The shells landed in thick salvo's, the noise and explosions around me, making my head spin as if

722
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:31.04
someone were banging in against a wall. I wielded the to stop, but the shells carried on. I'm landing

723
01:14:31.04 --> 01:14:38.24
around me. Then this second bar bombardment within minutes ended as suddenly as it had begun.

724
01:14:42.64 --> 01:14:52.96
So horrible, horrible situation that they're in. And much like we talked about the Germans having

725
01:14:54.32 --> 01:14:58.000
their mortars dialed in and they're artillery dialed in. It's the same thing. You're in the

726
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.36
Falkland Islands. There's obvious terrain features. So when you're holding a city like the

727
01:15:03.36 --> 01:15:09.04
the Argentinians military is in the city of Stanley, well they know where they're going to get

728
01:15:09.04 --> 01:15:12.80
attacked from and they know what are good firing positions. So they have those positions dialed

729
01:15:12.80 --> 01:15:20.24
into their artillery and they can just start hammering them. Back to the book, I can remember the O.C.

730
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:24.72
shouting behind me. Move, move. There artillery will be here soon again. So now they're trying to move.

731
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:30.16
Sergeant P waited only for me to squeeze myself through the gap before he took off again.

732
01:15:30.72 --> 01:15:36.64
After we had gone about four or five steps, a hand dropped out of the rocks grabbing at my ankle

733
01:15:36.64 --> 01:15:43.04
and denoms. The shock of it made us jump instantly. Sergeant P was back with me.

734
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:48.32
We both looked at my feet. Still holding my denoms was a wounded argy.

735
01:15:48.32 --> 01:15:56.96
His eyes were staring at me pleading perhaps full of sorrow. Sergeant P shouted step back

736
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:02.40
Brammer's. I tried to step back but the wounded soldier tightened his grip on me. I leaned

737
01:16:02.40 --> 01:16:07.60
back as Sergeant P pointed his weapon and fired two bullets into the man's head. The noise of his

738
01:16:07.60 --> 01:16:14.72
weapon echoing around the small gap. Tomo and Johnny were behind me now. The argy's head bounced

739
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:19.92
quickly as the two rounds entered him. His eyes rolled to the back of his head and his mouth opened

740
01:16:19.92 --> 01:16:24.88
to the release of trickle of blood and saliva which ran down his chin onto his shirt collar.

741
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:31.28
At the same time his hand gave up its grasp on my denoms and dropped onto my boot.

742
01:16:32.64 --> 01:16:39.12
I flicked my boot as if I was playing football. His hand and arm dropped across his body and from

743
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:45.44
his mouth came a low whistle of air mixed with blood. All this took seconds but it seemed like a

744
01:16:45.44 --> 01:16:52.56
lifetime to me. Each date detail remains with me today. The sight of this guy dying at my feet

745
01:16:52.56 --> 01:16:58.96
shocked me but I was growing harder. Although shaken I felt no remorse at the time.

746
01:16:59.76 --> 01:17:04.08
The deadly game of war lay at my feet. Only I mattered.

747
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:12.32
The rights of wrongs, the rights and wrongs of war can never be argued from the armed chair.

748
01:17:13.52 --> 01:17:17.28
Decisions are made on the spot questions asked afterwards.

749
01:17:18.64 --> 01:17:23.52
That lone argy could have been rigged to a booby trap or even armed.

750
01:17:24.72 --> 01:17:30.80
The kill was done quickly and professionally. I felt that I should have acted as quickly as

751
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:38.72
Sergeant P. Come on move he shouted. Sergeant P screamed in order for me to follow him.

752
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:43.28
As we trotted further into the clearing we had to jump over the twisted pile of corpses.

753
01:17:45.36 --> 01:17:52.96
My mind was never nor has since been so alert. A adrenaline was rushing through my body so

754
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:58.72
quickly that I felt I was floating with excitement mingled with fear. A little further into the

755
01:17:58.72 --> 01:18:06.08
clearing lay three or four Argentinians visibly shaken. Shaking visibly close together on the ground.

756
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:12.40
We ran half walked through a deadly sickening area of death. They looked up as we arrived.

757
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:16.32
All had been seriously wounded and were moaning and crying.

758
01:18:18.08 --> 01:18:21.60
One held up his hands across his eyes and shouted mama.

759
01:18:21.60 --> 01:18:31.76
I felt he thought that we were or I was about to shoot him. He was known calling for his mama

760
01:18:31.76 --> 01:18:39.28
in a low whale. One Argentinian sat in a trance. His eyes wide and staring at nothing.

761
01:18:40.80 --> 01:18:46.80
Tears ran down his face the only sign that he was alive. None of them moved.

762
01:18:46.80 --> 01:18:56.32
All looked like they expected to be shot by us but we ran past. The whole area was littered with weapons,

763
01:18:56.32 --> 01:19:05.76
helmets, clothing and food and ammo. A few bullets whizzed overhead and smashed into the rocks.

764
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:10.56
A corpus shouted that tumble down. This is another prominent terrain feature.

765
01:19:10.56 --> 01:19:17.20
Tumble down was firing at us. We ran into a tight gap in the gpath and all came to an abrupt

766
01:19:17.20 --> 01:19:23.76
halt as it was a dead end. Four or five bodies lay sprawled their close together.

767
01:19:25.12 --> 01:19:31.36
This time they were our own men. The camouflage pair of smocks hit my eyes immediately.

768
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.20
CSM Wix was standing over them like a guardian, screaming at some of his men to cover the further

769
01:19:39.20 --> 01:19:46.56
end of the path in the small crest. The CSM and Sergeant P exchanged quick words. I wasn't listening.

770
01:19:47.68 --> 01:19:53.84
My mind was totally occupied with looking into the crags for the enemy. I turned to look at

771
01:19:53.84 --> 01:19:58.72
our own lads dead on the ground, mode down when they tried to rush through this gap.

772
01:20:00.56 --> 01:20:08.32
I felt both anger and sadness. The CSM's face showed the strain of having seen most of his company

773
01:20:08.32 --> 01:20:15.52
either wounded or shot dead. That night's fighting was written in every line of his face.

774
01:20:17.84 --> 01:20:23.04
We all doubled back into the clearing we had just run through. We spread out and waited for our next move.

775
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:31.68
A wounded Argentinian lay right next to me 10 meters away. He'd been hitting the chest and

776
01:20:31.68 --> 01:20:38.88
screamed as he held the wound. A lad from B company ran across the clearing atom and ran his

777
01:20:38.88 --> 01:20:47.04
bayonet through him. The screaming Argentinian tried to grab the bayonet from him before it took his life.

778
01:20:49.04 --> 01:20:57.52
Our lad screamed shut up, shut up you cunt. The enemy soldier died as the bayonet was withdrawn.

779
01:20:57.52 --> 01:21:03.92
The lad walked back to his seat among the rocks as if nothing had happened.

780
01:21:07.68 --> 01:21:11.92
To my right, three Argentinians were crying with their heads in their hands.

781
01:21:13.20 --> 01:21:18.56
Were they the dead men's friends? At their feet lay one of our lads,

782
01:21:18.56 --> 01:21:24.16
moaning in pain as a medic attended to him. I could see his back was peppered with trappinol.

783
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:33.20
I swung to my left and fell against some rocks. I now felt the shock of it all coursing through my body.

784
01:21:34.80 --> 01:21:38.16
I wailed softly, my throat feeling like I wanted to choke.

785
01:21:40.16 --> 01:21:44.40
My eyes watered and I shook my head to force myself into reality.

786
01:21:47.52 --> 01:21:48.88
But this was reality.

787
01:21:48.88 --> 01:21:58.32
I looked for Bob and Johnny. I couldn't see Bob, but Johnny was there staring right at me.

788
01:22:00.56 --> 01:22:04.08
Our eyes met telling each other that we felt the ended come.

789
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:11.04
A lad resting with his rifle pointed towards tumble down,

790
01:22:11.04 --> 01:22:18.80
turned, fell into a tight ball, curling himself up as he hit the ground, screaming, incoming, incoming.

791
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:23.44
We all dropped to the ground, crawling behind rocks wherever we could.

792
01:22:24.64 --> 01:22:27.44
The first shell went over us onto the west side of the mountain.

793
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:35.12
Then the shell started to creep up towards us, and one bump into the clearing, hitting a rock

794
01:22:35.12 --> 01:22:40.88
about 30 meters away. The ground shook as if we'd been hit by an earthquake,

795
01:22:40.88 --> 01:22:44.80
shrapnel prite pierced the ground or bounced off of rocks all around us.

796
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:49.44
Grant, grinned him, screamed out, the shrapnel had hit his leg.

797
01:22:50.64 --> 01:22:55.92
Two of his mates were pulling him into better cover as the shells rained down us around us again.

798
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:04.88
Soon after, corpus Stuart McLaughlin was hit in the back

799
01:23:04.88 --> 01:23:11.60
by shrapnel. He was later killed by a direct mortar hit as he was being taken to a first aid post.

800
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:19.68
I laid their trembling as shells roared over us, each explosion shook more fear into us.

801
01:23:26.80 --> 01:23:32.24
We had centered our group about halfway along the mountain.

802
01:23:32.24 --> 01:23:38.16
The O.C. shouted us to split up a bit, otherwise a direct hit would cause a heavy loss.

803
01:23:38.96 --> 01:23:43.12
Through your four anti-tank lads got up and ran to a bunker on the other side of the hill,

804
01:23:43.76 --> 01:23:49.60
as another salvo came rushing in on us. A shell crashed into the rock above the O.C.

805
01:23:49.60 --> 01:23:52.48
sending shrapnel and rock in the opposite direction to us.

806
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.08
He looked up at all of us, as we looked at him expecting him to be dead.

807
01:23:58.08 --> 01:24:03.12
Since the shell had only landed a few meters from us all, he shouted across.

808
01:24:03.12 --> 01:24:04.96
Well, that was an oddie. One wasn't it.

809
01:24:06.88 --> 01:24:11.28
We laughed unanimous in appreciation of his complete calm.

810
01:24:14.24 --> 01:24:16.24
The shells came in for over an hour.

811
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:21.84
We just laid their hoping, praying that it would end soon.

812
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:29.84
I lay looking straight into Johnny's face who at times would poke out his tongue or do his grin again.

813
01:24:32.32 --> 01:24:36.80
The shell and stopped as usual as suddenly as it had began.

814
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:40.96
I stood up and saw Cav Connery crouched by a rock.

815
01:24:42.32 --> 01:24:45.20
Cav I screamed. He looked over and smiled.

816
01:24:45.20 --> 01:24:46.88
Get your arms over here, you twop!

817
01:24:46.88 --> 01:24:52.88
He had started to walk towards us when two or three more shells hit home.

818
01:24:53.92 --> 01:24:59.84
We all flopped the ground once more. The vibration of the explosions shook us on and the earth landed

819
01:24:59.84 --> 01:25:06.88
on our backs. We jumped up to see Cav running towards us. He jumped into our little opening.

820
01:25:06.88 --> 01:25:10.16
Jesus, fuck me, he said, I've had a right night of it too.

821
01:25:11.76 --> 01:25:14.000
Where's Johnny Crow and Skitty? Mate, I asked.

822
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.24
Cav looked into my face and said, Johnny's dead.

823
01:25:20.16 --> 01:25:25.60
He's dead, Vince killed outright. Skitty's been wounded. Only me left.

824
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:28.32
Oh, for fuck's sake, how?

825
01:25:30.08 --> 01:25:34.40
In the attack, a burst around's head, Johnny Square in the chest. I reckon he was dead before

826
01:25:34.40 --> 01:25:40.08
he hit the ground. Cav explained. We carried on chatting about the situation in general.

827
01:25:40.08 --> 01:25:46.32
Rick Westy was brewing up for us when we heard the booming sound again from Stanley.

828
01:25:47.52 --> 01:25:50.88
Incoming someone screamed, not again Johnny shouted.

829
01:25:52.40 --> 01:25:56.80
We were getting more scared with each bombardment. We hit the ground and fought to get legs,

830
01:25:56.80 --> 01:26:00.08
arms, and bodies more comfy and secure than each others.

831
01:26:01.36 --> 01:26:06.08
At this rate they'll get us. We can't have luck on our side forever, you know, I shouted,

832
01:26:06.08 --> 01:26:12.80
as the shells exploded around us. I lay next to Cav, we both faced the mess tin, where a couple

833
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:18.56
was brewing. A shell landed not three meters away, sending shrapnel and dirt in our direction.

834
01:26:19.52 --> 01:26:24.88
Rocks and earth fell around us, then over us, as if we were about to be buried alive.

835
01:26:26.48 --> 01:26:31.84
Both Kevin and I automatically reached out to cover the mess tin and the water that was coming to a

836
01:26:31.84 --> 01:26:40.000
boil. The dirt landed on our hands and the brew was saved. Everyone burst out laughing.

837
01:26:41.44 --> 01:26:45.52
Talk about a time of crisis to all let's have a cup of tea Johnny shouted.

838
01:26:53.44 --> 01:27:00.48
Brutal. The, you know, great account and I know we've been done gone through a lot of

839
01:27:00.48 --> 01:27:07.52
accounts of being sheldered with artillery. That's a very descriptive and granular one.

840
01:27:09.12 --> 01:27:16.72
And it's not over. Back to the book, Kevin, I walked up and over the hill.

841
01:27:17.68 --> 01:27:24.16
Ricky followed us armed with a smock order with every pocket filled with mags for SLRs. We came to

842
01:27:24.16 --> 01:27:30.72
a clearing. Ricky was busy looking to one side of us when suddenly Kevin I heard moaning. We stepped

843
01:27:30.72 --> 01:27:37.12
up on a ledge and came face to face with a wounded argy. Sitting beside him was his friend who

844
01:27:37.12 --> 01:27:44.72
obviously wouldn't leave him. The wounded soldier had been shot in both knees and in his chest and arms.

845
01:27:45.92 --> 01:27:53.68
Blood showed on all the wounds his face showed no pain merely pleading. His mates stood up and put his hands

846
01:27:53.68 --> 01:28:01.92
up. No one had seen these two until now. I pointed my rifle and bay in that and nodded towards

847
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:08.08
the wounded guy. He started wailing and moaning and put both hands together as if praying to me.

848
01:28:09.52 --> 01:28:15.44
Kevin pulled a pistol from his belt. Well, Vince, we either shoot them or help them.

849
01:28:16.24 --> 01:28:22.96
What will it be? Kevin lowered his pistol and looked at me. I raised my rifle and framed the wounded

850
01:28:22.96 --> 01:28:29.84
argy's head right in the sight. The man looked down as if he was expecting death knowing that he could

851
01:28:29.84 --> 01:28:38.08
do nothing about it. He wailed louder. I lowered my rifle.

852
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:46.96
Kevin, he looks like my neighbor. I'll help them, okay? Yeah, okay. I'm off the find some goodies.

853
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:53.68
He walked off. I motioned to his mate to sit on the other side of the wounded guy while I

854
01:28:53.68 --> 01:28:59.76
placed my weapon to one side of me and went down to help. The wounded argy's mate shook his head,

855
01:28:59.76 --> 01:29:07.76
looking at my rifle. Me, friend, me, friend, you, friend. You helped my friend. We all friends now.

856
01:29:07.76 --> 01:29:15.84
He pleaded. I looked at him and gave him a small grin. He grinned back. I didn't trust him one bit.

857
01:29:17.68 --> 01:29:24.32
The wounded guy started to cry. It was then that I felt sad. Sad that I had fought of killing

858
01:29:24.32 --> 01:29:31.12
them and that we were all in this mess together. We had different views and different homes,

859
01:29:31.12 --> 01:29:39.76
but there we were all together. I still hated the enemy, but just then when that guy started to cry,

860
01:29:39.76 --> 01:29:46.24
I felt different. We all had to be hard, hard to the facts of what was happening to all of us.

861
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:49.92
Killer be killed.

862
01:29:49.92 --> 01:30:00.24
I made my way back to where our team was stationed. I got there as Rick was sitting down.

863
01:30:00.96 --> 01:30:06.32
The O.C. was busy with orders. Vince, we're out of water. Got me. Johnny asked. No,

864
01:30:06.32 --> 01:30:12.80
I replied. Just then Captain Mason shouted. And Avv you've seen Peter Headaker around.

865
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:20.88
I saw him last night with Gith with Jin, with Jin and West Sir. I shouted. Perhaps West

866
01:30:20.88 --> 01:30:29.12
you'll know. Captain Mason looked at me with serious eyes. All the support team who were sitting there

867
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:36.08
looked at Captain Mason and me. I felt something was wrong. The O.C. motioned me over.

868
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:46.08
I got to him and crouch down. Corporal B. Jin's McCarthy was killed and so was Philip West.

869
01:30:47.28 --> 01:30:54.72
The shell was meant for your gun team. A flashback of what had happened filled my mind.

870
01:30:54.72 --> 01:30:58.000
The smock pulled from my back, the spinning head, the deafness.

871
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:09.28
It must have missed you by inches. Corporal B. U.K. Yeah. I'm okay. I'll go find Headaker then.

872
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:14.08
Captain Mason came over. Sir, he said to the O.C.

873
01:31:15.20 --> 01:31:20.000
Pete Headaker was killed also. The bearers have now found his body.

874
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:33.28
I stood up and walked back to my spot. I was gutted beyond belief. Pete had always been my mate.

875
01:31:35.20 --> 01:31:41.36
We spent many times together drinking in the shop. I met his family too.

876
01:31:41.36 --> 01:31:49.44
Now he was dead. Only a short while ago I'd been sitting beside him.

877
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:59.28
He'd said what a good spot he had. Now he was dead. Killed by a shell that was meant for me.

878
01:31:59.28 --> 01:32:07.12
I'll never forget that I survived while he was killed.

879
01:32:07.12 --> 01:32:31.68
So they do some movement. They actually get back up into their positions to where they were.

880
01:32:31.68 --> 01:32:37.84
Actually, the word, where gingit been when he had been killed. Going back to the book, we turned around to where

881
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:44.08
gingit lane and walked back from the skyline to find a gap through which to find the gap through which

882
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:50.80
sergeant P. had led us. In this way, we avoided being seen from tumble down.

883
01:32:50.80 --> 01:33:00.64
On the ground, I saw bits of clothing and flesh everywhere resembled a slaughter yard.

884
01:33:03.52 --> 01:33:06.88
We walked down 10 meters or so and there was more and more.

885
01:33:08.72 --> 01:33:12.16
Stuck on the side of Iraq was clearly a large piece.

886
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:19.76
Johnny and I moved closer to it and my stomach turned as I saw the nose and cheek of a face.

887
01:33:22.80 --> 01:33:30.96
We looked at each other, our eyes wide. I put my bandet under the flesh and flicked it to the ground before

888
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:43.12
bearing it quickly. Neither of us spoke. I had no doubts and P. N. confirmed to me that this was the

889
01:33:43.12 --> 01:33:51.12
remains of a mate. P. told me later that he had died instantly, from only the waste down remained.

890
01:33:51.12 --> 01:34:01.20
I felt good at beyond belief. I had been told of the direct hit that it also killed two others

891
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:08.88
to see it with my own eyes. The body and remains was another story.

892
01:34:08.88 --> 01:34:21.52
Over walking over the crest, we bumped into Pat Harley. With him were one or two others,

893
01:34:21.52 --> 01:34:27.60
although I no longer remember who they were. As I was talking to Pat, I noticed a helmet on the

894
01:34:27.60 --> 01:34:35.68
end of an SLR planted in the rock face. Notting towards this, Pat mentioned that he had come up

895
01:34:35.68 --> 01:34:42.96
and found Jordi Lang dead. We rounded the rock face and at our feet laid dock and Jordi,

896
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.64
both on their backs. They had died in an open space with the infamous tumble down looking down on them.

897
01:34:54.72 --> 01:35:01.92
Jordi had died trying to save dock. The bastard sniper had caught him in the open as he reached him.

898
01:35:01.92 --> 01:35:11.20
Jordi lay with his mouth slightly open. Gunshot wounds to his chest and stomach meant he died quickly.

899
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:17.52
Evidence around him showed that he had tried to reach dock. He had been

900
01:35:18.32 --> 01:35:25.92
had he been calling for him, help himself. Pat looking cut up took Jordi's

901
01:35:25.92 --> 01:35:33.12
bags, saying he'd want us to have these rather than the re-election on. Returned our attention to

902
01:35:33.12 --> 01:35:41.52
dock who was more depressing. docked head and died quickly. Quickly. He must in fact

903
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:49.04
have been fully aware of his injuries. The top part of his skull was blown away the brain visible

904
01:35:49.04 --> 01:35:56.32
smashed by a sniper's bullet. Only the fragmented skull had prevented the complete collapse

905
01:35:56.32 --> 01:36:03.44
of the side of his head. How he survived the impact God knows, laying beside him were items from

906
01:36:03.44 --> 01:36:09.92
the first aid kit he'd been carrying. Field dressing half open, safety pins in his right hand fingers

907
01:36:09.92 --> 01:36:18.32
near the ground. His left hand held a morphine syringe. This had been used the thin needle point

908
01:36:18.32 --> 01:36:25.84
towards him. It must have been his dying act. His radio mic was still attached to his throat.

909
01:36:27.36 --> 01:36:34.000
Her close friend told me many months later, dock fell on his radio, the sending switch was stuck

910
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.32
and he was on permanent send to all of us. We could hear him gurgling and moaning as he became

911
01:36:42.32 --> 01:36:51.20
aware that he had been shot badly. Vince and sent the signalers nuts, but we were all helpless.

912
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:58.16
The sniper picked it anyone that moved. Jordey tried and lost his life for it.

913
01:36:59.68 --> 01:37:04.56
We eventually had to turn on to the emergency frequency to establish communications again.

914
01:37:04.56 --> 01:37:12.80
Doc had remained conscious and eventually died on a part of that mountain, alone with a lad

915
01:37:13.68 --> 01:37:15.44
who would bravely try to rescue him.

916
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:35.04
So, just to explain that on your... Yeah, what's called a push to talk button on your radio

917
01:37:35.04 --> 01:37:47.04
and however he fell, he landed on that push to talk so that he was broadcasting his death

918
01:37:47.04 --> 01:37:52.16
and his dying was broadcast over the network for everyone to hear.

919
01:37:52.16 --> 01:38:10.56
These guys, they still have to fight and they start gathering against some intelligence.

920
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:16.16
They think there's a counter attack coming in. By the way, this intense fighting is a matter of gaze.

921
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:19.36
So, everything that we're talking about is happening in a couple days.

922
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:23.60
And now they think that there is a counter attack coming.

923
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:30.24
So, they dig in, they get in position, they set their machine guns up from where they think the counter

924
01:38:30.24 --> 01:38:37.52
attack from the Argentinians is going to come from. And then they start getting mortar again.

925
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:41.84
Hit with artillery, here we go back to the book. We all hit the ground again as the shell landed.

926
01:38:42.56 --> 01:38:47.12
No sooner had I started to pick myself up. When a high-pitched scream rushed into my ears,

927
01:38:47.12 --> 01:38:54.24
a deadly sound, I can still hear it today. I looked down to where the shell had hit in the same

928
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.32
areas before. The ground was smoldering, smoke lifting and evaporating.

929
01:39:00.40 --> 01:39:08.48
Five meters away from the hole, lay two bodies. The sight of one of them will stay with me until I die.

930
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:15.76
His parasmoc was riddled with smoke escaping from every corner. The arms, bottom and collar.

931
01:39:17.68 --> 01:39:22.32
The lad turned on to his back screaming, oh God, help me, help me, please.

932
01:39:24.48 --> 01:39:31.04
I ran down the hill in fright and concerned. I dropped to my knees by the screaming soldier. His eyes met mine.

933
01:39:31.04 --> 01:39:39.76
Did he register me? I only saw Denzel. Denzel, the character we all loved.

934
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:48.72
I wrenched my eyes to his legs. One was hanging off ripped to shreds. The bone clearly visible.

935
01:39:49.60 --> 01:39:54.40
His screaming churned by stomach. It was like nothing I'd ever heard. He tried to look down at his

936
01:39:54.40 --> 01:40:00.72
leg. Don't fucking look this way. I barked, lay back down, hear me. He dropped to his back holding his

937
01:40:00.72 --> 01:40:08.16
spot. Five. Jonah Jones, a nine squadron lad came to my side. Vince, I'll deal with him. You see

938
01:40:08.16 --> 01:40:13.60
the him. He said pointing to Craig Jones. Craig lay very close to Denzel.

939
01:40:15.68 --> 01:40:20.88
Clive rushed to help me. Craig hadn't any visible wounds. He lay quietly as

940
01:40:20.88 --> 01:40:27.28
Clive tried to talk to him. I tried to pull a smock open and pull his trousers down to check

941
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:33.20
for a wound. Denzel screamed and moan behind me. Help me. Jonah was busy seeing to his leg.

942
01:40:35.04 --> 01:40:39.92
I pulled out my knife and started to cut through Craig's denoms and quilted art at clothing.

943
01:40:40.64 --> 01:40:44.96
My friend at cutting was too slow and I knew it. The doctor skitted him beside me.

944
01:40:44.96 --> 01:40:47.84
Pulled out his scissors and started to cut through Craig's leggings.

945
01:40:50.24 --> 01:40:53.68
I pulled the ripped material to one side. We had reached the skin.

946
01:40:53.68 --> 01:40:59.52
His legs had massive laceration and all directions spilling muscle and bone,

947
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.80
but there wasn't hardly any blood. The doctor shouted at me to tie his muscles together.

948
01:41:06.80 --> 01:41:11.68
I pulled out my field dressings and tied the laceration together. The doctor was joined by a

949
01:41:11.68 --> 01:41:18.24
medic who went to Denzel. I was half conscious of cries of medic. Metic stretcher bearer all

950
01:41:18.24 --> 01:41:25.92
down the hill. Craig was lying still. I slid up beside him and looked into his face.

951
01:41:25.92 --> 01:41:29.76
It was pale with no color at all. His eyes stared into my face.

952
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.80
You'll be okay Craig. Just hang on mate. Hang on.

953
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:40.08
Clive held his head. Stroking his forehead repeating my words,

954
01:41:40.08 --> 01:41:45.84
Craig, can you hear me? I shouted. The doctor pulled in tubed frantically at Craig's clothing

955
01:41:45.84 --> 01:41:51.68
trying to reach more obvious wounds. Craig, you'll be okay. Hang on.

956
01:41:53.60 --> 01:42:00.96
You looked at me and his slight smile came across his face. His eyes laughed at me.

957
01:42:02.16 --> 01:42:11.36
Bright and wild. His grin spread. Then all expression faded.

958
01:42:11.36 --> 01:42:34.40
And he faded away. Craig, Craig, don't keep in there. His eyes closed. He died then and there.

959
01:42:34.40 --> 01:42:44.80
He was a young soldier 20 years of age. The records will say,

960
01:42:44.80 --> 01:42:55.20
private Craig Jones. The doctor motioned a bearer to get him on and away.

961
01:42:55.20 --> 01:43:03.92
Dencil was also lifted and carried away. I fell onto my bottom.

962
01:43:06.16 --> 01:43:10.48
Jones and Clive padded me on the shoulder. I tried to get up but felt to my knees again.

963
01:43:13.12 --> 01:43:17.12
I hadn't realized until then that I was crying crying without knowing it.

964
01:43:17.12 --> 01:43:26.000
I cried with all the pain and sadness. It didn't seem fair.

965
01:43:30.32 --> 01:43:35.60
Johnny came to my side and picked me up. He picked up my weapon and started to guide me to our bunker again.

966
01:43:37.36 --> 01:43:41.44
I glanced at Steve and Sass. Sass was crying as well and Steve had his

967
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:55.12
head buried in his hands. I stumbled to our bunker weeping. When I sat down Steve

968
01:43:55.12 --> 01:43:59.44
wake put around his arm around me and whispered, you'd done a brave thing Vince.

969
01:44:00.96 --> 01:44:04.32
I couldn't have gone down there after those shells landed in the same spot.

970
01:44:04.32 --> 01:44:16.40
You done all right mate. His gesture didn't register. I cried with exhaustion, hatred, and pity.

971
01:44:19.52 --> 01:44:25.84
Craig and Dencil remain with me today. Craig who died and Dencil lost a leg and so nearly as life.

972
01:44:25.84 --> 01:44:35.28
When people write or tell of experiences of this kind, I know now that they can never

973
01:44:35.28 --> 01:44:42.08
really tell the facts for anyone to totally understand. For often the reader is wrapped in his own

974
01:44:42.08 --> 01:44:50.16
make-believe game of war. For me personally this five-minute experience changed my whole life

975
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:59.76
and attitude towards war. War's will always be fought and I would go again for my beliefs,

976
01:44:59.76 --> 01:45:07.52
but I hope never again to see a face fade from me. It took me nearly a year.

977
01:45:08.96 --> 01:45:17.04
After this war for Craig's face to go before I slept. Newly a year to wipe out Dencil's

978
01:45:17.04 --> 01:45:26.64
smock on fire and his scream. Until I die it will remain a part of me.

979
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:53.44
And because it is war there is no time to mourn and soon after that they are marching for their final

980
01:45:53.44 --> 01:46:00.72
assault on Stanley, which is the capital city. Going back to the book after we had tabbed about

981
01:46:00.72 --> 01:46:09.12
1000 meters with wireless ridge clearly visible above us. The absence of troops and the silence of

982
01:46:09.12 --> 01:46:13.60
guns in Stanley began to produce some puzzle looks along the line of support company.

983
01:46:15.44 --> 01:46:21.60
Our O.C. shouted for a halt. We collapsed on the frosty ground to wait for orders. I looked

984
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:26.72
up at the sky thinking what now? Who's fucked up this time? Let's just get this part started.

985
01:46:29.36 --> 01:46:33.44
A few shouts came down the line. I lent forward and saw that the line was breaking up in the

986
01:46:33.44 --> 01:46:41.76
men laughing. Sergeant McMathus was sitting behind me. Besides me. What's going on? Make I asked

987
01:46:41.76 --> 01:46:50.40
fucknose events. The shouting continued as messages passed down towards us. A guy three or four

988
01:46:50.40 --> 01:46:56.16
positions down from us suddenly turned round and shouted the wankers have surrendered. A white flag

989
01:46:56.16 --> 01:47:05.28
is flying over Stanley. Put your braze on index index. The last part of the message had an ironic

990
01:47:05.28 --> 01:47:12.32
ring because for some of the task force the whole thing had seemed like an exercise. So index is a

991
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:17.84
term. We say it all the time and training. When you want to stop the exercise you say index

992
01:47:17.84 --> 01:47:22.56
it's short for index or size. So that's one of those things where it seemed like for some of the

993
01:47:22.56 --> 01:47:28.72
guys they were just on this big exercise. And so they literally said hey it's index and to the exercise

994
01:47:28.72 --> 01:47:35.28
right now. Make and I looked each other. Bollocks I said we stood up to see the remains of free

995
01:47:35.28 --> 01:47:43.52
pair of coming off longden in their red braze. Joy washed through my body. Make and I hugged each

996
01:47:43.52 --> 01:47:51.44
other. Nothing more was said. The message had reached everyone. I slipped off my helmet and put

997
01:47:51.44 --> 01:47:59.12
on my beret which had stayed close to hand throughout. As I stood looking down at moody brook

998
01:47:59.12 --> 01:48:08.000
the red braze stuck out like sore thumbs against the grass. I felt proud. The beret on my head

999
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:18.08
meant more than any task the army had ever thrown at me. It meant victory. The feeling is

1000
01:48:18.96 --> 01:48:33.44
indescribable. Now that's that and they spend obviously it's over but it's not like you just

1001
01:48:33.44 --> 01:48:40.48
get to step and it's instantly over. They spend time there. They go through some pretty significant

1002
01:48:40.48 --> 01:48:48.16
looting and he talks about that a bunch and he kind of comes to he goes kind of berserk and looting

1003
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:53.76
and they're all just gathering up war trophies and whatever they can find to value and they go into

1004
01:48:53.76 --> 01:49:01.44
this one sort of a bunker position to loot and they on one side of the bunker it's all a bunch of

1005
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:07.60
weapons and the other side is other kind of more personal type items and they have so many weapons

1006
01:49:07.60 --> 01:49:11.12
if they don't need anymore so they go and they start taking stuff from the other side.

1007
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.52
Mem a little like I said personal items I think it was and they walk out of there and then the next

1008
01:49:19.52 --> 01:49:26.24
day they find out that the side with the weapons on it was all booby trapped with 70 pounds of explosive

1009
01:49:26.24 --> 01:49:29.92
so they went in there if they would have picked up like two or three things off of that it was

1010
01:49:29.92 --> 01:49:34.48
a pressure plate a pressure release so if they were picked up two or three things they would have

1011
01:49:34.48 --> 01:49:38.80
gotten killed his him and his crew would have gotten killed and that's when he realized you know when

1012
01:49:38.80 --> 01:49:45.20
he talks about he's like I was so greedy I wasn't even thinking anymore they go through that they eventually

1013
01:49:45.20 --> 01:49:52.72
they get done they ship away and eventually end up two and I wonder then from from a different

1014
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:59.20
island they fly back to back to England and here we're going back to the book we stepped off the plane

1015
01:49:59.20 --> 01:50:07.60
at RAF Brise Norton the next morning we were hit by the English summer in full blaze as we entered

1016
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:12.80
the airport lounge the doors were slung open to screaming crowd of relatives who charged towards us

1017
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.48
my mother climbed over chairs to hug me with all the rest of my family and close pursuit

1018
01:50:18.48 --> 01:50:26.64
my wife came up to me I was tense and made unsure by all the noise and shouting it made me

1019
01:50:26.64 --> 01:50:35.20
scared in a peculiar way Karen looked hard and almost angry hello Vince was all I got from her

1020
01:50:36.88 --> 01:50:43.68
so he's home obviously his wife was a little bit tense about some things back to the book

1021
01:50:43.68 --> 01:50:48.24
he actually before he go back to the book he they they do a little quick greeting with their

1022
01:50:48.24 --> 01:50:54.16
family but then they get back on a bus with the rest of the the people the Italian members

1023
01:50:55.12 --> 01:51:00.000
and they start driving back to their compound back to the book always very quiet on the journey

1024
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:06.24
the English countryside made me feel like an alien Johnny tapped my shoulder from behind

1025
01:51:06.24 --> 01:51:12.88
Vince the trees man look at them I looked at the trees they were part of what was making me feel

1026
01:51:12.88 --> 01:51:19.68
like an alien they were all in full bloom bright green leaves in the wind there was traffic on the

1027
01:51:19.68 --> 01:51:26.80
roads shops people walking about doing their own thing it all seemed unreal after only three months

1028
01:51:26.80 --> 01:51:36.40
away it was a shock to see civilization again the odd thing was I felt anger anger and everyone

1029
01:51:36.40 --> 01:51:41.84
for doing their own thing it was as if something in my head was urging me to shout at them as they

1030
01:51:41.84 --> 01:51:47.28
walked along the streets hey you looking your fucking ice creams there's a fucking lot of injured

1031
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:54.80
guys over there friends have been killed but all you're interested in is yourselves

1032
01:51:58.32 --> 01:52:05.36
just frustration I know the general public was concerned but it just didn't seem like it then

1033
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:11.76
I wasn't expecting a metal or even a pad on the back I really didn't know what to expect

1034
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:19.04
even so I found it hard to become there was no way I could relax if I had been asked to go

1035
01:52:19.04 --> 01:52:25.60
do a torn Ireland I would have gone more than anything I felt the pinch of no longer having my

1036
01:52:25.60 --> 01:52:32.24
friends around me we had been together so tightly over the last few months that it was as if

1037
01:52:32.80 --> 01:52:40.96
now I had had a set an arm severed the buddy buddy system that we had needed to literally survive

1038
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:45.60
wasn't there anymore and the sheltered life now seemed too far

1039
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:54.08
but now seemed to me far too boring to endure I made a point of not talking about my experiences

1040
01:52:54.08 --> 01:52:59.04
to any member of my family including my wife but I do remember sitting up in bed one evening

1041
01:52:59.04 --> 01:53:07.52
turning my wife and giving her a very mild insight into what had really happened I was sick

1042
01:53:07.52 --> 01:53:12.08
to death of the presses views and of the publicity of a country still high on war

1043
01:53:14.80 --> 01:53:21.76
I told Karen what had happened to Denzel and Jones the blank look she gave me

1044
01:53:22.32 --> 01:53:27.12
with a half smile told me she wasn't interested and couldn't understand me at all

1045
01:53:29.36 --> 01:53:37.20
I never said anything again I tried to look at it from her point of view instead she was sick of

1046
01:53:37.20 --> 01:53:45.68
the war of the army and of me going away whenever I bumped into one of the lads I see more at home

1047
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:51.28
and relax talking our private language with him then I did with civis and my own family

1048
01:53:54.72 --> 01:53:58.56
if I had had my own way I would have gone out on the biggest bend or ever

1049
01:53:58.56 --> 01:54:05.76
but I knew that was the easy way out

1050
01:54:10.64 --> 01:54:16.96
these remind me of one soldier's war you know you come back and there's no doubt

1051
01:54:18.16 --> 01:54:22.72
when you come back from war you're gonna feel some of this I'm gonna tell you right now

1052
01:54:22.72 --> 01:54:25.76
you're gonna feel some of this when you see civilians walking around

1053
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:32.96
looking their ice cream cones it's gonna it's gonna it's good it's a it's a rough transition

1054
01:54:32.96 --> 01:54:40.08
you know back to the book there's no doubt that I was slowly unwinding over the long leave

1055
01:54:40.72 --> 01:54:44.16
but the board I'm also gave me more time to think about my experiences

1056
01:54:45.92 --> 01:54:48.08
worst of all were my nightmares about the war

1057
01:54:48.08 --> 01:54:54.80
at first they came nightly later they faded and returned intermittently

1058
01:54:56.40 --> 01:55:02.64
I always had the same dream of Denzel's smock and Jones's face passing before me

1059
01:55:04.08 --> 01:55:08.40
I would wake up in a bed so wet that a bucket of water might have been thrown over me

1060
01:55:11.52 --> 01:55:16.88
the nightmares lasted about six months or so today I can see and understand everything that has

1061
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:24.64
happened to me I know now that I wasn't alone the most comforting words I ever had to help me

1062
01:55:24.64 --> 01:55:30.56
did not come from any of my family my family were concerned but could never really understand

1063
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:36.80
what I was going through those words came from my friends in the pub as we drank during leave

1064
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:44.32
Johnny turned to me and said vents I've had a few turns in the night you know

1065
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:51.92
that made me sit up and see clearly that I wasn't alone and when you're not alone

1066
01:55:53.52 --> 01:55:54.32
you're stronger

1067
01:56:00.80 --> 01:56:05.92
so that's something that I hear from a lot of vets

1068
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:13.92
and maybe you're thinking that this is something you're experiencing that no one else is

1069
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:20.64
not true not only are other guys going through it other guys have always gone through it

1070
01:56:23.04 --> 01:56:27.84
you're not alone back to the book I fully believe that we as a nation performed the most

1071
01:56:27.84 --> 01:56:33.76
excellent of tasks I'm fully behind the decision to send the task force and I wouldn't

1072
01:56:33.76 --> 01:56:41.20
hesitate to fight again for a country and its beliefs people who win jibbout the decisions taken

1073
01:56:41.20 --> 01:56:51.68
in war they weren't involved in to me are the most misguided of all the most striking events

1074
01:56:52.72 --> 01:56:56.40
to affect me throughout the war were obviously the deaths of my friends

1075
01:56:56.40 --> 01:57:02.32
eight years ago I regarded those friends as those in two and three pairs only

1076
01:57:04.08 --> 01:57:09.60
now after learning about others experiences and after watching and reading others accounts

1077
01:57:09.60 --> 01:57:17.52
I see that the whole task force was my friend I watched a marine sergeant in a TV documentary

1078
01:57:17.52 --> 01:57:28.56
his eyes showing the emotion of his story and the site told me we were all the same

1079
01:57:31.76 --> 01:57:38.48
I still feel a bit angry that the wounded went unnoticed a propaganda film on the task force

1080
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:42.88
as a rival home showed only the pairs in the Marines in the navy homecoming

1081
01:57:42.88 --> 01:57:50.48
can you remember seeing the badly wounded coming through the gates I think not

1082
01:57:52.80 --> 01:58:01.92
nobody wants to see the effects of carnage never again will I think that war is just a game

1083
01:58:04.16 --> 01:58:09.12
like they showed on TV it is very different from how it is portrayed in books and films

1084
01:58:09.12 --> 01:58:18.80
we call ourselves into the killing game don't we I remember very clearly watching from a window

1085
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:24.80
of my quarters five or six kids playing a war game some were even dressed in combat gear

1086
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:31.44
and carrying small toy machine guns I watched with interest in their tactics and attacking

1087
01:58:31.44 --> 01:58:38.72
a cardboard box that was meant to be an enemy held position the two kids defending rolled over

1088
01:58:38.72 --> 01:58:46.40
and pretended to die went over run by the goodies after being tegged by their friends they got

1089
01:58:46.40 --> 01:58:56.32
up to resume the game from me high we start to practice what is in human nature to defend and kill

1090
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:06.000
the one big difference between their game and the real one is that you don't get up after really

1091
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.72
being shot who are as the legal killing of people and can be very scary

1092
01:59:15.76 --> 01:59:25.20
who are as killed or be killed we also must remember that a lot of the command structure

1093
01:59:25.20 --> 01:59:29.76
at junior rank level can almost be too difficult to maintain in the heat of battle

1094
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:37.84
then what becomes a winning factor is the determination of the private soldier

1095
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:49.20
his loan get up and go and do attitude we must take our hats off to the junior ranks of all

1096
01:59:49.20 --> 01:59:54.72
services for they are the backbone of the war machine in that they have to kill a close range

1097
01:59:54.72 --> 02:00:02.16
we are lucky to have what is perhaps one of the best fighting forces in the world

1098
02:00:02.16 --> 02:00:05.28
thanks to our system of training and to our discipline

1099
02:00:09.20 --> 02:00:15.68
even today I feel frustration about the war I was so psyched up to carry on with the fight

1100
02:00:15.68 --> 02:00:20.24
into Stanley that the Argentinian surrender may be disappointed as well as happy

1101
02:00:20.24 --> 02:00:29.12
I try very hard to keep out of fist fights now as I wouldn't like to lose myself control

1102
02:00:31.68 --> 02:00:39.60
do my alone in feeling this or their hundreds or thousands of other time bombs out there

1103
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:46.80
other experience veterans may be sympathetic to all of said

1104
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:53.76
we can only wait for the next war now to practice the art of killing again

1105
02:00:55.76 --> 02:00:56.88
I hope I'm there to help

1106
02:00:59.84 --> 02:01:07.28
finally I must quote a first world war veteran who told me so many years before I joined the army

1107
02:01:07.28 --> 02:01:18.40
you'll like the army events but not war it's horrible boy he was right

1108
02:01:20.40 --> 02:01:27.76
I didn't like it then again I did

1109
02:01:27.76 --> 02:01:48.40
I'm going to close this book out with the beginning of this book and it reads

1110
02:01:48.40 --> 02:02:00.24
this book is dedicated to the soldiers of three parah whose comradeship and determination

1111
02:02:00.24 --> 02:02:03.84
throughout the campaign make the author proud to have served with them

1112
02:02:08.16 --> 02:02:14.40
so that the members of three parah who never returned are not forgotten their names and ages

1113

private Philip West 19

1134
02:04:35.04 --> 02:04:48.40
and

1135
02:04:53.04 --> 02:04:54.72
you notice those names

1136
02:04:58.16 --> 02:05:01.12
those men their ages

1137
02:05:01.12 --> 02:05:08.24
and their ranks they're all their all junior ranks

1138
02:05:08.80 --> 02:05:12.000
the one sergeant sergeant Ian McCay

1139
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.08
who was awarded the Victoria Cross for storming 50 caliber machine gun

1140
02:05:20.08 --> 02:05:30.80
mission but the rest of those men are privates and Lance Corpore's and Corpore's

1141
02:05:32.88 --> 02:05:37.36
young men and

1142
02:05:39.84 --> 02:05:41.28
as Kipling pointed out

1143
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:48.000
they're no plaster saints by any stretch

1144
02:05:51.84 --> 02:05:52.48
but damn

1145
02:05:52.48 --> 02:06:05.92
they might not be saints

1146
02:06:12.32 --> 02:06:14.80
but I've no men like these

1147
02:06:14.80 --> 02:06:21.92
and I've seen them with my eyes

1148
02:06:27.20 --> 02:06:29.28
and as I have said

1149
02:06:32.72 --> 02:06:37.84
and as this tale of the Falquins confirms once again

1150
02:06:37.84 --> 02:06:46.72
war is hell and it's a hell that can bring out the worst in men

1151
02:06:49.12 --> 02:06:50.80
but it can also bring out the best

1152
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:00.32
and don't forget these young men

1153
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:06.88
who like so many others

1154
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:11.20
answered the call

1155
02:07:14.96 --> 02:07:22.16
fought and died in that awful place to protect their brothers

1156
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:36.88
and for the more and if you read this book you will realize that we all have a little bit more to give

1157
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:46.56
mentally and physically you can go further you can push harder

1158
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:53.92
you can be more ruthless if you have to be and you can also show more mercy

1159
02:07:59.92 --> 02:08:00.88
you can be better

1160
02:08:03.60 --> 02:08:12.64
I can be better we can all be better and we most often get better not from the easy things and not from the good times

1161
02:08:12.64 --> 02:08:22.80
but from the hard times then the challenges and the suffering in life that pushes you to your breaking point

1162
02:08:26.08 --> 02:08:31.92
and demands that you give absolutely everything you have

1163
02:08:31.92 --> 02:08:39.52
but you have to keep going

1164
02:08:44.96 --> 02:08:49.20
so no matter what

1165
02:08:53.12 --> 02:08:53.84
keep going

1166
02:08:53.84 --> 02:09:07.68
and I think that's all that I've got for tonight

1167
02:09:07.68 --> 02:09:16.72
to be

1168
02:09:19.76 --> 02:09:26.80
crazy hell how it got that crazy that vicious in like that short period of time

1169
02:09:28.16 --> 02:09:34.24
it is and we we had to remember that that's what we have one perspective

1170
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:42.32
from one squad for in one platoon and there was you know the story of two pair

1171
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:44.48
the one where the battalion commander

1172
02:09:45.76 --> 02:09:52.40
eight Jones won the victorier cross by the way what about that what about that story

1173
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.92
and not to mention the royal marines that were down there as well what about their stories

1174
02:09:57.92 --> 02:10:06.56
yeah and that's the thing that just it's I still can't wrap my head around the amount of

1175
02:10:07.92 --> 02:10:12.000
untold stories that there are and not just the not just the fact of the stories

1176
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:21.52
but to think that these because this is this battle is a very short time compared to Vietnam or

1177
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:27.12
World War Two or World War One or even the wars that we've been fighting today that have been going on

1178
02:10:27.12 --> 02:10:34.56
for years and years and years but it's not so much at the story that that like we're missing the story

1179
02:10:34.56 --> 02:10:47.68
but these people existed everywhere and they exist everywhere and and yeah it's it's

1180
02:10:47.68 --> 02:10:55.04
it's an incredible the take a look at the book by the book and read it and it's I actually

1181
02:10:57.28 --> 02:11:01.68
I got into some of the graphics stuff some of the some of the interaction to them when they're not

1182
02:11:01.68 --> 02:11:08.24
in combat is actually it's real crude and I didn't you know I didn't cover much of it not that

1183
02:11:08.24 --> 02:11:12.32
you know I wanted to get to more of the combat constraints that's kind of I didn't realize that I

1184
02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:18.000
didn't cover as much as sort of just the straight-up crude behavior that they that they I mean they're on the

1185
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.84
both for a while they're drinking they're getting drunk when they're coming home it's there's some

1186
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:30.96
some crude behavior and and things that are taking place and that's kind of why I jumped on the

1187
02:11:30.96 --> 02:11:38.48
opportunity to read Tommy by gippling because that's totally true then you know what they say in

1188
02:11:38.48 --> 02:11:47.60
kind of our way of saying that in the seal teams we would say this we that guy is a in case

1189
02:11:47.60 --> 02:11:52.40
of war break glass kind of guy oh yeah meaning we don't want him around all the time we want to keep

1190
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:57.04
him over here on the side in the glass but yeah if something happens yeah break glass and we'll get

1191
02:11:57.04 --> 02:12:05.52
this this frog man out now what's what's jacked up about that is that's that played more

1192
02:12:05.52 --> 02:12:11.84
of a role when I was first in the seal teams and the more the the older I got the moment sure I got

1193
02:12:11.84 --> 02:12:18.08
the more I realized like that's that's okay but it doesn't really work what you need is to have someone

1194
02:12:18.08 --> 02:12:24.16
that you can have out of the glass and that learns and what you have to do is a leader is you take

1195
02:12:24.16 --> 02:12:30.40
those guys that instead of putting those guys in the glass jar or behind a in a glass box somewhere

1196
02:12:30.40 --> 02:12:36.16
and keeping their in case war what you do is you do what you do with a freaking wild dog you have to

1197
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:40.88
train them you have to bring them out you have to socialize them amongst the humans so that they

1198
02:12:40.88 --> 02:12:46.80
can so that they can interact because a guy that you have to keep in you know in behind a glass

1199
02:12:46.80 --> 02:12:53.12
barrier from the rest of the world the chances of you needing him for that type of situation are

1200
02:12:53.12 --> 02:12:58.64
pretty minimal so what about all the other situations that he'd be beneficial for so what you have

1201
02:12:58.64 --> 02:13:04.32
to do is a leader is teach those guys that have the attitude of you know I'm just I'm just a

1202
02:13:04.32 --> 02:13:10.24
nothing but a straight warrior don't care about anything else I'm here to go to war otherwise leave

1203
02:13:10.24 --> 02:13:14.40
me alone what you want to do is you want to get those guys out into the world socialize them like a good

1204
02:13:15.20 --> 02:13:19.04
attack dog that that's not going to bite anything in front of it's going to actually bite what you

1205
02:13:19.04 --> 02:13:25.20
want it to bite and then you have something that's a much more valuable not only for you as a

1206
02:13:25.20 --> 02:13:30.40
leader but for them because they have a much better opportunity so there's still a few guys left in the

1207
02:13:30.40 --> 02:13:35.84
old mold of in case of war break glass but most of the guys now are are actually

1208
02:13:36.72 --> 02:13:42.72
more versatile than that and I'll tell you when I was young I was probably falling at a category

1209
02:13:42.72 --> 02:13:51.52
I wasn't exactly the guy you wanted to throw out in front of the admiral to look at right and say

1210
02:13:51.52 --> 02:13:57.12
this is our model guy right here it's you know wouldn't have been that way now at the old

1211
02:13:57.12 --> 02:14:03.20
I got them or I recognized how important having that both sides of the of the coin covered

1212
02:14:03.20 --> 02:14:08.16
and you couldn't just be of freaking rampaging berserk or all the time you had to actually

1213
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:16.24
be a professional yeah to be a professional and so I definitely had my share of time spent in that zone

1214
02:14:16.24 --> 02:14:25.84
back in the day but what's good is I think guys knew that about me and that therefore when I

1215
02:14:25.84 --> 02:14:31.04
came up to and said hey man look we gotta we gotta do better than that or hey we we can't be acting like

1216
02:14:31.04 --> 02:14:38.88
that they knew that I wasn't coming to them from a from a what's that we're from the ivory tower

1217
02:14:38.88 --> 02:14:44.08
I wasn't looking down on them like all I can't believe you're not that way we don't act out

1218
02:14:44.08 --> 02:14:50.08
way we're naval representatives I wasn't coming to like that I was coming to and hey we're professionals

1219
02:14:50.08 --> 02:14:55.12
we gotta get we want to get hired to do jobs we want to kill bad guys we got to get missions

1220
02:14:55.12 --> 02:15:01.92
we got to get mission approval those were the things that that you know I kind of passed on to

1221
02:15:01.92 --> 02:15:08.80
to my guys was hey that's cool be a frog man but be a disciplined frog man yeah be a frog man

1222
02:15:08.80 --> 02:15:14.80
that can represent and I think that's another thing in the book when there's no war going on how

1223
02:15:14.80 --> 02:15:19.76
we're that you know they're they're the kind of maniacs you know yeah and and then when the war breaks

1224
02:15:19.76 --> 02:15:27.44
out they go even more maniacs style and it's almost like they get into that mode of like who cares

1225
02:15:27.44 --> 02:15:32.56
anyways we're gonna die we're gonna die we just you know who cares but after you go to war

1226
02:15:32.56 --> 02:15:36.80
for an extended period of time you're like actually you're not gonna die actually

1227
02:15:36.80 --> 02:15:43.52
there's a decent chance you're gonna live and there's a decent chance that you need to

1228
02:15:43.52 --> 02:15:49.36
continue to build you know the the reputation of the seal teams not just as

1229
02:15:50.40 --> 02:15:55.68
where killers but where professionals yeah so and we should have a reputation of both

1230
02:15:55.68 --> 02:16:04.88
and we do by the way thanks ill professional killers is right but yeah it's a great book there's

1231
02:16:04.88 --> 02:16:09.68
a lot to learn from it there's a lot to learn again I that that the way that they're going

1232
02:16:09.68 --> 02:16:13.36
from peacetime and again I know that they were doing tours in Ireland at the time and that was

1233
02:16:13.36 --> 02:16:19.68
no joke and they took casualties in Ireland and there was many soldiers killed in northern Ireland

1234
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:26.56
but that wasn't comparable to what they went through in the focklands so it was interesting to see

1235
02:16:26.56 --> 02:16:33.76
how they handled approaching combat for the first time yeah another part that I think these books

1236
02:16:33.76 --> 02:16:39.44
really bring to light is just the physical conditions that that they go into even talking

1237
02:16:39.44 --> 02:16:42.16
talking to you guys when you guys talk about how hot it is then everyone's gonna all you

1238
02:16:42.16 --> 02:16:47.60
add a detail like oh yeah so I'm like you know all my clothes are all wet from my sweat

1239
02:16:47.60 --> 02:16:51.76
and usually that's not part of the movie when you watch the movie you know or like these guys

1240
02:16:51.76 --> 02:16:57.04
is for just feet are falling off you know because it's cold and I was sitting in a combat outpost

1241
02:16:57.84 --> 02:17:03.60
in Ramadi and it was nighttime right the coolest part of the day and I wasn't doing anything and

1242
02:17:03.60 --> 02:17:08.16
I hadn't been doing anything and I was literally sitting in a combat outpost you know the

1243
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:12.96
boys were out in an Overwatch position and I was back there I had been quarantined but I did it it

1244
02:17:12.96 --> 02:17:17.36
wasn't that it wasn't that established of a combat outpost yet so I still had all my gear on

1245
02:17:17.36 --> 02:17:21.28
but I was just sitting there I've been sitting there for let's call it two three four hours

1246
02:17:22.80 --> 02:17:28.64
and I was sitting there and I just kind of put my I was sitting down and I angled my back to like a

1247
02:17:28.64 --> 02:17:33.84
45 degree angle and I was kind of looking at the ground kind of resting a little bit and as I looked down I was

1248
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:41.60
full athletic sweat dripping off me like that fast and I wasn't doing anything yeah that's just

1249
02:17:41.60 --> 02:17:45.44
that's the bait that's where you start yeah that's where you start not to mention guys legs

1250
02:17:45.44 --> 02:17:53.04
getting blown off all this stuff all these yeah man yeah that's crazy yeah it's um the physical

1251
02:17:53.04 --> 02:17:58.16
and the other big thing is the physical conditioning that you need to be prepared for

1252
02:17:59.36 --> 02:18:04.16
is is pumping with a rock sack on yeah that's a big deal that you know that you know they don't

1253
02:18:04.16 --> 02:18:09.44
show a lot of that no and any kind of military training they don't just show it they don't show

1254
02:18:09.44 --> 02:18:15.76
it enough they should they should I mean we just did another trip up to Yosemite and we got our boots boots

1255
02:18:15.76 --> 02:18:23.68
boots on and it's it's if you're not conditioned for that it's gonna be hard and you can make it

1256
02:18:23.68 --> 02:18:28.72
through a day yeah maybe you can make it through two days but also you're not carrying I was telling

1257
02:18:28.72 --> 02:18:36.48
my my kids up there up in the mountains you're not carrying any weight compared to what you carry

1258
02:18:36.48 --> 02:18:41.92
with when you have gear when you have the when you go tactical you don't have the you probably

1259
02:18:41.92 --> 02:18:47.12
have 30 pounds maybe if you're just if you're just camping or whatever you've got a couple you

1260
02:18:47.12 --> 02:18:52.80
got a couple leaders of water you've got a sleeping bag in a ground pad you've got some trail mix

1261
02:18:53.44 --> 02:19:00.08
maybe a little bit more food but you're talking 30 40 pounds tops yeah you get geared up

1262
02:19:01.44 --> 02:19:05.84
bro I would weigh guys would before we'd send them out on training operations I'd weigh

1263
02:19:05.84 --> 02:19:12.80
them training operations they're there rocks away like 110 pounds you're gear alone you're your

1264
02:19:12.80 --> 02:19:23.36
body armor helmet ammo magazines you know magazines an ammo grenades you're your 60 70 pounds

1265
02:19:23.36 --> 02:19:29.12
then you put water that you're talking I think I think I weighed like 310 or something with like

1266
02:19:29.12 --> 02:19:37.12
you're on seriously like roll well cop yeah roll the cop still heavy on on roll I think it was part

1267
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:42.56
two where he shocks himself because he wants to get rid of the messed up director see like given

1268
02:19:42.56 --> 02:19:47.36
he falls down right he's unconscious and then they're like hey we gotta help him they try to pick

1269
02:19:47.36 --> 02:19:54.64
him up oh he's too heavy to move yeah that actually happened to uh we were on a training exercise

1270
02:19:54.64 --> 02:20:00.96
and tea bruiser and I got put down they said a jockel your dead so I made down and I just

1271
02:20:00.96 --> 02:20:07.20
laid there and life came over to throw me in the back of the home v i was like a robot cop down there

1272
02:20:07.20 --> 02:20:11.60
so life got a couple buddies who said hey guys help him move jockel still not moving dead weight

1273
02:20:11.60 --> 02:20:16.64
job and they're like okay yep you know you were like making extra effort to be dead weight

1274
02:20:16.64 --> 02:20:20.64
oh yeah for sure like you're like I'm not fully participating you know training exercise

1275
02:20:20.64 --> 02:20:27.92
I wanted those guys to be prepared to put a grenade in my mouth and be there so you get some

1276
02:20:30.80 --> 02:20:37.44
awesome well speaking of lots of stories maybe you could tell some stories about

1277
02:20:38.24 --> 02:20:46.40
how to support this I'd be happy to know no short story hey did you get into drinking

1278
02:20:46.40 --> 02:20:52.88
pomegranate white tea and subsequently jockel white tea because your wife is a Brit no he's into tea

1279
02:20:52.88 --> 02:20:57.44
she turned you on the tea and she didn't really because they drink tea with milk and I don't

1280
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.48
yeah but you know hey you can get a credit but she doesn't get credit for that one she drinks tea yeah

1281
02:21:04.48 --> 02:21:09.36
she did drink her put the kettle she says she says a couple tea couple tea like here or anything she says

1282
02:21:09.36 --> 02:21:15.04
well couple tea what's the reason real but doesn't cure everything is the same thing like that I don't know

1283
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:20.24
who that was yeah I think it's like Chris Ross I don't remember specifically where I got the first

1284
02:21:20.24 --> 02:21:25.92
cup of jockel white tea from but I do remember that it was in the desert when I was I was at the training

1285
02:21:25.92 --> 02:21:32.56
command and I was would be giving the debriefs or sitting through the guys briefs and we'd be

1286
02:21:32.56 --> 02:21:39.04
going on like 234 hours to sleep so you need a little bit of kick yeah somebody has somewhere I

1287
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:45.60
got some jockel some tea yeah it wasn't yet jockel white tea just pomegranate white tea yeah and

1288
02:21:46.48 --> 02:21:51.12
yeah that's where I'm for and I drank it I was like this nice yeah this is nice the cold one

1289
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.76
yeah wait was it cold yeah yeah yeah or definitely had it cold because you're at the desert

1290
02:21:55.76 --> 02:21:59.68
you don't want to drink hot tea unless you're British yeah yeah kind of productive they be drinking

1291
02:21:59.68 --> 02:22:04.96
hot tea no matter what they don't even drink lasty I don't really like hot tea that much

1292
02:22:04.96 --> 02:22:09.60
yeah that whole island they don't really like iced tea like you can't go to restaurant all

1293
02:22:09.60 --> 02:22:13.76
so iced tea they look at you like you're weird yeah yeah which I've been looked at many times there

1294
02:22:13.76 --> 02:22:19.36
yeah for me weird this face it you you're kind of weird bro that's all right anyway

1295
02:22:20.88 --> 02:22:26.72
you got if we want to support ourselves first off I'm gonna talk about my little stories not sure

1296
02:22:26.72 --> 02:22:31.20
sorry Longland no please kidding remember I told you I got to take a little bit of press I got the

1297
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:36.24
on it kettlebells right so if the first ones I got get all the the design of ones they're cooler

1298
02:22:36.24 --> 02:22:43.12
might be yeah I don't think I've ever yeah I used the regular ones before at other gyms

1299
02:22:43.12 --> 02:22:47.12
but anyway I get the the cool ones the ones that someone takes a picture of me and I have

1300
02:22:47.12 --> 02:22:52.64
on my look like extra cool with the primal you can see how different our thought patterns are yeah

1301
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:58.72
you're here to win I get it and I can dig it fully but I got the chimplons those are

1302
02:22:58.72 --> 02:23:08.80
what one pood okay whatever the 16-ing killer went up to the werewolf just the other day I ordered

1303
02:23:08.80 --> 02:23:16.32
the gorilla what's that one 70 something I got a pair I incorporate that in I'm getting strong

1304
02:23:16.32 --> 02:23:20.72
man I'm getting good at the kettlebells you're gonna need them 88's like I got yeah wait what is the one

1305
02:23:20.72 --> 02:23:26.48
that that it's big foot right I don't know what that is but my the biggest kettlebells that I currently

1306
02:23:26.48 --> 02:23:34.32
have yeah our 40 kilograms yeah it's like yeah 88 pounds what's 90 something because 2.2 pounds per

1307
02:23:35.36 --> 02:23:42.08
kilogram okay so it's like we can do the math if you want but nonetheless that's heavy oh I don't

1308
02:23:42.08 --> 02:23:48.08
know I'm I don't know if I'm ready for that and given my current exercise program with them

1309
02:23:48.64 --> 02:23:54.72
I do we should start doing math exercise yeah maybe more break it's calculated or whichever

1310
02:23:54.72 --> 02:24:00.16
either way that's the one I got and so so look yeah I'm gonna recommend it if you're into kettlebells you

1311
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:06.80
want to you know get your kettlebells on get on it once they're cooler that's my opinion good

1312
02:24:06.80 --> 02:24:12.64
a lot of cool stuff I got a jump rope and stuff like that too um you know what I'll say did

1313
02:24:14.16 --> 02:24:19.36
hundred burpees in 10 minutes oh brand like where you at yeah yeah yeah see remember last time

1314
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.56
you did it yeah I didn't brand it just so you know echo is now he notoriously bad cardio

1315
02:24:26.56 --> 02:24:32.08
not like that I mean you you you you credit I'm giving you credit but still we could use that

1316
02:24:32.08 --> 02:24:37.12
as sort of a statement to say if echo could do it come on brand and yeah actually I think the

1317
02:24:37.12 --> 02:24:43.12
statement is look off our echo has come look how far I think that's the statement will make

1318
02:24:43.12 --> 02:24:47.60
I just made it there you go far echo has come said he can do a hundred burr a lot of people thinking

1319
02:24:47.60 --> 02:24:52.16
how on a burpees in 10 minutes is a joke actually yeah I could I could dig it I mean I've been doing

1320
02:24:52.16 --> 02:24:57.20
burpees for for a while not that kind you know not to kind my they're just in my routine

1321
02:24:57.20 --> 02:25:00.88
oh yeah many but I'm familiar with them so I'm like okay you can you know how you can kind of

1322
02:25:00.88 --> 02:25:05.20
gauge like okay I do this many so what it would a hundred take out of me you know can I do it

1323
02:25:05.20 --> 02:25:14.64
243 2010 yeah so how I did it was 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest

1324
02:25:14.64 --> 02:25:21.12
15 and then like two minute minute and a half maybe I don't know something like that give

1325
02:25:21.12 --> 02:25:30.72
or take and then a 10 and actually sorry 11 I did 101 burpees and it was nine minutes flat

1326
02:25:30.72 --> 02:25:36.96
that's good yeah branded what you got here's what I found here's I don't know if my cardio is good

1327
02:25:36.96 --> 02:25:41.52
or bad is better than it has been it's better than all time just in general even due to

1328
02:25:41.52 --> 02:25:46.96
and other stuff what's the stuff all so you know I'm you know when you run and I don't know

1329
02:25:46.96 --> 02:25:53.04
you know get not just yeah whatever hey life man something life those physical challenges at you

1330
02:25:53.04 --> 02:26:01.52
either way so yeah I did 101 in nine minutes flat what it was was I wasn't breathing as hard as

1331
02:26:01.52 --> 02:26:06.88
maybe you might think like that wasn't the the issue wasn't the breathing was like just

1332
02:26:06.88 --> 02:26:12.000
boom push up but I'm pushing it jump and the acting acid okay yeah yeah yeah but would you feel legs

1333
02:26:13.52 --> 02:26:20.16
weird yeah legs fully shoulders not chest like I think you know do it a push up one every you

1334
02:26:20.16 --> 02:26:26.40
know second isn't that much for me but strangely my shoulders and this part that like what you call

1335
02:26:26.40 --> 02:26:31.92
these the serrats they're like sore next day you know weird way it was weird man none the last

1336
02:26:31.92 --> 02:26:37.60
yeah I did prove that burgers are good exercise yes fully got you some funky work out there yeah

1337
02:26:37.60 --> 02:26:42.000
this is it's good and then so I go in youtube I see this one guy does 100 in a row oh my

1338
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.16
dang because 25 was I didn't know I was gonna be like hey I'm gonna do as many as I can how long

1339
02:26:48.16 --> 02:26:54.88
it's taking me 100 in a row oh three minutes and 33 seconds if I'm not mistaken that's credit yeah

1340
02:26:54.88 --> 02:26:59.04
you know what here's the thing though here's the thing I think it's the thing I don't know

1341
02:26:59.04 --> 02:27:03.20
it's thing or not that's why I'm asking a question okay so what really is a burpee I mean as far

1342
02:27:03.20 --> 02:27:08.08
as like okay so when I first started doing burpees I want to do burpee is you your chest touched

1343
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:12.72
the ground and jump in there okay so what about my hands do they have to go about my head or can

1344
02:27:12.72 --> 02:27:17.68
they be yes technically it's a little clap over the head oh a clap so what I mean over the head like

1345
02:27:17.68 --> 02:27:21.76
technically has to be above the head so if I go like this or doesn't have to be well this you guys

1346
02:27:21.76 --> 02:27:25.84
do this I do a little bit of everything and depending on how tired I am okay if you see when I'm

1347
02:27:25.84 --> 02:27:30.72
really tired my clap was barely happening and it's happened and like six inches in front of my belly

1348
02:27:30.72 --> 02:27:37.84
yeah okay so here like but if you want to be like technical yeah I mean a really technical

1349
02:27:37.84 --> 02:27:42.72
perfect burpee would be like both hands clapping up above your head as your six inches in the air

1350
02:27:42.72 --> 02:27:46.72
yeah you can't do too many though you can't do as many those though no bear to tell you

1351
02:27:46.72 --> 02:27:51.20
not at all that's kind of the difference between the dynamic jump like a high jump

1352
02:27:51.20 --> 02:27:57.28
and not a dynamic jump is real big huge huge and that's the word is the line so

1353
02:27:58.24 --> 02:28:03.20
for me here's the line get your hands above your head get your feet off the ground that's it right

1354
02:28:03.20 --> 02:28:08.08
I think that's yeah I did I I was otherwise you're like hey you didn't jump

1355
02:28:08.80 --> 02:28:12.72
three inches yeah but what if you know because if you want to do that what you do you put your

1356
02:28:12.72 --> 02:28:18.88
your you put your 135 on the ground a barbell with 135 on it and you hop over that

1357
02:28:18.88 --> 02:28:22.32
and each time chest to the ground on one side chest the ground on the other side chest to the

1358
02:28:22.32 --> 02:28:28.32
that's another way if you're going to require I like when you can't cheat but you can't cheat that

1359
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:33.60
right you have to jump over it yeah no that's what's cool about like burpee pull ups you

1360
02:28:33.60 --> 02:28:38.24
you gotta get chest to the ground I don't care how you do it chest to the ground and get your

1361
02:28:38.24 --> 02:28:41.60
chin over the bar that I don't care what you do in between those two yeah that's a burpee

1362
02:28:41.60 --> 02:28:47.36
making it pretty much alright well then I have to be honest then here's my disclaimer

1363
02:28:47.36 --> 02:28:53.44
the push up it I didn't touch my chest to the ground you need like okay I mean was it like

1364
02:28:53.44 --> 02:29:01.04
was it like an incomplete probably some of them were like I mean I guess I don't do I'm not like

1365
02:29:01.04 --> 02:29:07.28
every single time right yeah here's the thing it's to your discretion right it's like it's like

1366
02:29:07.28 --> 02:29:13.12
that's you know when you didn't do a burpee let's face it if we wanted to you know get some

1367
02:29:13.12 --> 02:29:17.60
Guinness Book of World's right scenario then sure yeah but we we I think you're right

1368
02:29:17.60 --> 02:29:23.60
you know what a burpee is yeah I know what a burpee is yeah get it right yeah so mine and just to

1369
02:29:23.60 --> 02:29:29.44
kind of in the spirit of honesty so I didn't touch my because here's the thing if I was to

1370
02:29:30.48 --> 02:29:34.56
if in on the push up part if you touch your chest over every time you actually slow down enough

1371
02:29:34.56 --> 02:29:40.16
that it's not hitting your cardio as much yeah in my opinion yeah maybe I mean I guess added up

1372
02:29:40.16 --> 02:29:45.52
yeah I guess and you know what I saw though when I saw that guy doing the burpees he was on

1373
02:29:45.52 --> 02:29:50.32
I think it was just a regular gym floor maybe a mat or something and he was doing it and after

1374
02:29:50.32 --> 02:29:54.96
while he starts banging his chest like oh he's showing my goal you're getting a bounce on the

1375
02:29:54.96 --> 02:29:59.52
bench I'm saying yeah getting a little bounce so I'm thinking you know what that could be easier

1376
02:29:59.52 --> 02:30:04.72
for me if I did on a mat I think it'd be easier than having to stop your body weight and not

1377
02:30:04.72 --> 02:30:09.76
touch you know but it's gonna be what you're used to for sure but I didn't touch my chest and

1378
02:30:10.48 --> 02:30:16.32
there were like four of them that I didn't put like four because when I started the set I'm like oh shoot

1379
02:30:16.32 --> 02:30:21.12
those you know two or three I didn't put my hands above my head so I didn't show it yeah you know

1380
02:30:21.12 --> 02:30:26.88
so maybe like four five of them didn't technically count but I feel like if I would have put my hands

1381
02:30:26.88 --> 02:30:32.24
above my head on those four it wouldn't have made a difference that's what I think but if I'm like

1382
02:30:32.24 --> 02:30:36.72
you know the kind where I'm filming at the master you know I'm filming this girl she's doing the

1383
02:30:36.72 --> 02:30:41.20
perfect burpy while I'm filming her chest to the ground in fact when she went chest to ground

1384
02:30:41.20 --> 02:30:44.64
her hands came up off the ground oh just for like a second I'm like dang this feels like

1385
02:30:44.64 --> 02:30:47.68
you know what do they call the girls I think they call this game day pushups I don't know

1386
02:30:47.68 --> 02:30:51.84
okay and I don't know maybe I'm wrong yeah yeah I just called that which is weird exactly

1387
02:30:51.84 --> 02:30:57.68
you have a game day every day's game day so that's what you call it do that every day but

1388
02:30:57.68 --> 02:31:02.88
either way she's doing that and then she's going into the and her hands are straight in the air like

1389
02:31:02.88 --> 02:31:07.04
she's straight up with the everybody's in the shandie I go cross for uh sandy ankle master

1390
02:31:07.04 --> 02:31:13.68
not an autexus I put the clip in the video okay slow mox check it out yeah and she had the perfect

1391
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:19.92
form full beast mode full on and I'm thinking when I see that compared to the 101 that I did

1392
02:31:19.92 --> 02:31:23.68
no night in day man there would be like yeah he's not doing this whole part here in that

1393
02:31:23.68 --> 02:31:26.48
my hands are going like this they're going like this so they're above my head

1394
02:31:26.48 --> 02:31:30.64
I don't know what I'm gonna like it maybe Brandon Peckworth is doing eight inch or 12 inch

1395
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:34.64
vertical leap on each one like a beast and we're calling him out and he's actually

1396
02:31:34.64 --> 02:31:39.84
I know he's doing it the cracker and sorry Brandon if that's the case all right good well the

1397
02:31:39.84 --> 02:31:46.08
goal is now 100 I'm gonna follow the protocol I know one in 200 yeah like in a row yeah yeah

1398
02:31:46.08 --> 02:31:51.44
that'd be the big good yeah I'm gonna follow the protocol for sure oh I'll report back anyway

1399
02:31:51.44 --> 02:31:54.56
back to the kettlebells that's a good one the jump rope stuff that's a good one

1400
02:31:54.56 --> 02:31:58.16
on the on it one sets the cool ones my opinion just go on there check it out go on it

1401
02:31:58.16 --> 02:32:06.48
dot com slash jocco boom it's for yourself and the podcast also good way to support

1402
02:32:06.48 --> 02:32:13.12
when you buy these books the jocquer reviews did I chime in to everyone tomorrow good or

1403
02:32:13.12 --> 02:32:19.04
the website joccopadcast.com and chime in much today yeah man I was always kind of a heavy one yeah

1404
02:32:19.04 --> 02:32:26.72
heavy and I'm not gonna so you know what part I was gonna chime in what I respect your decision

1405
02:32:26.72 --> 02:32:31.52
but I respect your decision not to try to get it well you know how you're like it was at the

1406
02:32:31.52 --> 02:32:37.52
end anyway wait you're like this is just one story yeah you know you take and it's a slidly a sliver

1407
02:32:37.52 --> 02:32:43.52
really it is it's a sliver it's one guy and one story it's one guy there is four or five thousand

1408
02:32:43.52 --> 02:32:49.76
British servicemen down there yeah it's one five one four thousand so this this was my comparison

1409
02:32:49.76 --> 02:32:55.12
you know when you're driving in traffic on the street whatever the freeway and all you see is cars

1410
02:32:55.12 --> 02:33:00.32
oh my god infinite cars traffic is everywhere just cars and cars and cars and that's nothing

1411
02:33:00.32 --> 02:33:06.72
new and facts kind of irritating really but if you just take one little step like in your mind and

1412
02:33:06.72 --> 02:33:12.72
and look in the car and look that's a person in there and maybe sometimes two people in there

1413
02:33:12.72 --> 02:33:19.12
sometimes a little family each one of those people has their whole life story all the little

1414
02:33:19.12 --> 02:33:24.80
ups and downs and special things and you know challenges challenge struggles and triumphs all that

1415
02:33:24.80 --> 02:33:29.68
stuff you're one of those little things is a little guy in there and and even then that's no

1416
02:33:29.68 --> 02:33:36.000
buddy compared to everybody so that's analogy I was gonna make but seems kind of trivial you know

1417
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.32
compared to like guys on the freeway I like our story that's out of police yeah I got a self-cuff

1418
02:33:42.32 --> 02:33:48.88
police anyway back to these books if yeah if you want to get any of these books one or more

1419
02:33:48.88 --> 02:33:54.16
whatever they're listed by episode on the website jocopotcast.com and and by the way we started off

1420
02:33:54.16 --> 02:34:03.20
today before he record record record I said to echo you know you heard the book the what's

1421
02:34:03.20 --> 02:34:09.28
that saying don't judge a book by its cover the cover of this book you can judge it by it's called

1422
02:34:09.28 --> 02:34:17.44
excursion to hell by Lance Corporal Vincent Bramley and the picture on the cover looks like hell

1423
02:34:17.44 --> 02:34:21.04
it looks like it's a picture of him it's blown up real big but yeah you can judge a book by

1424
02:34:21.04 --> 02:34:26.32
its cover you can tell it's gonna be a rough story yeah it looks like he took a straight up excursion

1425
02:34:26.32 --> 02:34:32.08
to hell on that cover but if you want this book go to jocopotcast.com set a little tab on the top

1426
02:34:32.08 --> 02:34:36.80
thing you know top menu whatever books from podcast jocopotcast books whatever it's called

1427
02:34:36.80 --> 02:34:41.92
boom they're listed there by episode click through there get it through there good way to support

1428
02:34:41.92 --> 02:34:48.08
yourself of course and and the podcast takes you to Amazon also or if you're other shop any other

1429
02:34:48.08 --> 02:34:55.60
shopping oh that's a bonus bonus if you buy some port massive good that's still supports it's

1430
02:34:55.60 --> 02:35:02.32
more big time yeah like what like a like a 100 terabyte hard drive how much is that cost like four to five

1431
02:35:02.32 --> 02:35:08.72
grand oh not 45 grand four to five so like 40 depends which one you get or like a lawnmower can you

1432
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:14.56
buy a lawnmower from Amazon you can now yeah what do they do they they come with a big

1433
02:35:14.56 --> 02:35:20.56
forklift truck and be like oh not that big dude well no no no oh I'm sorry I'm thinking driving on more

1434
02:35:21.28 --> 02:35:26.96
oh so what do they do back it up is your lawnmower I don't know you probably can maybe

1435
02:35:26.96 --> 02:35:31.84
okay treadmill I know you can get a treadmill yeah treadmill is pretty big well either way

1436
02:35:31.84 --> 02:35:38.48
you can do your shopping boom click through there takes a two seconds small action really big reaction

1437
02:35:38.48 --> 02:35:45.28
by way of support I actually have been thinking that that is actually not the best analogy that

1438
02:35:45.28 --> 02:35:50.000
you've been using for like you would think that but you'd be wrong I think a better you ever

1439
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.28
heard of the the expression death by a thousand cuts yes it's more like that even though life by a thousand

1440
02:35:55.28 --> 02:36:02.64
clicks clicks sure yeah support yes yeah man I dig it because they all add up together yeah

1441
02:36:03.04 --> 02:36:08.08
because the sodium is little but it's big but you have to join it with all the other ones yeah so now

1442
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:14.88
you have a bunch of little sodium's boom huge reaction huge support wide spread huge support

1443
02:36:14.88 --> 02:36:18.96
by this little action from these you know what it is actually the sodium's better because of

1444
02:36:18.96 --> 02:36:22.48
if I'm clicking through I'm a listen I'm listening to this podcast I'm like you know I'm

1445
02:36:22.48 --> 02:36:26.56
gonna support I'm by one of these books I'm gonna you know by lawnmowers treadmill whatever

1446
02:36:26.56 --> 02:36:32.56
I click through the website just that two seconds of going to the website first clicking through

1447
02:36:33.12 --> 02:36:38.48
that's like so much potential in my click just like the the sodium so much potential energy in

1448
02:36:38.48 --> 02:36:42.72
there especially when you mix it with the water you mix it with the Amazon the click boom

1449
02:36:42.72 --> 02:36:50.24
support you follow we can move on yeah there you go back to my point anyway I just to everyone

1450
02:36:50.24 --> 02:36:56.96
for egging that on in some manner yeah well I respect your action ownership in the situation

1451
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:05.84
just know what you're gonna do to fix the next episode or you could subscribe to the podcast on iTunes

1452
02:37:05.84 --> 02:37:11.60
Stitcher and Google Play if you haven't already I think it seems well I don't want to say it seems obvious

1453
02:37:11.60 --> 02:37:16.72
but yeah if you don't you shouldn't you haven't yeah that's a great support yeah cool

1454
02:37:16.72 --> 02:37:22.32
stay updated all that stuff also on YouTube subscribe to that one I've been putting some stuff

1455
02:37:22.32 --> 02:37:27.36
this is kind of weird to me because we don't have that many YouTube subscribers

1456
02:37:28.96 --> 02:37:34.16
I forget I mean I look but it's not a ton it's not as many people as listen to the podcast

1457
02:37:34.16 --> 02:37:39.20
yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure but not a lot of people are like on YouTube you know okay I'm gonna watch

1458
02:37:40.40 --> 02:37:44.80
you know joc on YouTube yeah like that you're less compelled to do that especially if you're not on

1459
02:37:44.80 --> 02:37:49.12
YouTube just to eat it but what if you miss some of them deleted yeah you know that's something but

1460
02:37:49.12 --> 02:37:54.32
consider like if you never go I would always work with a group this last week and they're full on

1461
02:37:54.32 --> 02:38:00.80
caught up on the podcast every single episode legit dudes getting after it and I mentioned the

1462
02:38:01.44 --> 02:38:06.16
deleted scene that came out and they there are three of them none of them had seen it oh see

1463
02:38:06.16 --> 02:38:11.68
none of them had seen it and that's that's a good scene it's funny anyways yeah I know I use bad

1464
02:38:11.68 --> 02:38:17.36
language but it's got a refreshing breath you know like you can cut loose your like off your

1465
02:38:17.36 --> 02:38:23.36
joc was always on you're off no you're on you're in a different way I was going off

1466
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:31.28
subscribe to the YouTube channel if you're on YouTube or if you're thinking about getting on

1467
02:38:31.28 --> 02:38:36.08

1468
02:38:36.08 --> 02:38:42.48
that it's a you know subscribe to nothing one click oh man one click no money just click one click

1469
02:38:42.48 --> 02:38:46.88
and here's the thing it's a total non commitment situation you can literally subscribe

1470
02:38:47.44 --> 02:38:51.84
and 10 seconds later you can unsubscribe then you can do that again you can do as many times

1471
02:38:51.84 --> 02:38:57.04
why it's like so easy so it's really that's a small action big reaction situation another one

1472
02:38:58.56 --> 02:39:04.64
also joc was a store see that time I say it quite I would it's good lord into your trap just moved on

1473

1490
02:40:53.04 --> 02:40:58.96
to you about different stuff weaknesses different weaknesses there you go so really this is what you

1491
02:40:58.96 --> 02:41:03.20
need this is a different stuff doesn't cut it yeah because joc was talking about you about the type

1492
02:41:03.20 --> 02:41:09.84
of toothpaste that he uses right right now I didn't say that well maybe it depends you know how

1493
02:41:09.84 --> 02:41:15.04
there's a controversy about for right being in the toothpaste you know I'm just saying that's important

1494
02:41:15.04 --> 02:41:20.56
I'm really egging you on today I'm just saying you brought it up bro anyway what it's really for

1495
02:41:20.56 --> 02:41:31.28
this album is in your campaign against weakness yeah that's the new phrase not journey anymore

1496
02:41:31.28 --> 02:41:40.40
it's campaign against yeah yeah Andy good bread he gave me though because I don't like saying journey

1497
02:41:40.40 --> 02:41:45.04
that's what I'm saying message you and said hey quit saying journey say campaign against weakness

1498
02:41:45.04 --> 02:41:51.68
which is actually from the podcast which is legit layers big time anyway thanks Andy for that one

1499
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:55.68
but that's the one I'm using for right now until like a better one comes up if that's even possible

1500
02:41:55.68 --> 02:42:00.72
so in your campaign against weakness every single day for the rest of your life now that's you're

1501
02:42:00.72 --> 02:42:05.76
in the game right now it's for the rest of your life yeah I can't pay last forever yeah there's no discharge

1502
02:42:05.76 --> 02:42:12.08
for the war yeah I'm a tank so there's how many out big time anyway so if you're trying to wake up

1503
02:42:12.80 --> 02:42:16.40
you know early every day or you know five days a week however long you know however much

1504
02:42:17.28 --> 02:42:20.88
and you got that day where you supposed to wake up early and you don't want to you just don't

1505
02:42:20.88 --> 02:42:28.56
feel like it that's really the thing you don't feel like it you know so joc is there for for you

1506
02:42:28.56 --> 02:42:34.48
with the little spot diet stuff procrastination stuff workout stuff creativity stuff that's a

1507
02:42:34.48 --> 02:42:39.04
big one and I don't listen to the creativity one that's because you feel like you're all creative

1508
02:42:39.04 --> 02:42:43.76
no but here's the thing I'm like one of those things you know how like you know how like let's say

1509
02:42:43.76 --> 02:42:50.48
you had like a pimple or something or is it I know I'm going deep but if you have a zit some people

1510
02:42:50.48 --> 02:42:54.56
they're like I'm gonna pop this in some people they're like no leave it alone let it go away

1511
02:42:54.56 --> 02:42:59.60
you see what I'm saying so I'm like the I'm the latter when it comes to creativity I'm like man

1512
02:42:59.60 --> 02:43:06.24
I'm not creative I'm not creative block don't don't force it don't like get joc on here telling me

1513
02:43:06.96 --> 02:43:12.96
pragmatically by the way but still you have to it now you have no good idea thankfully it's a little

1514
02:43:12.96 --> 02:43:18.40
bit more than that but you know that's kind of the philosophy I'm not saying that's the best way

1515
02:43:18.40 --> 02:43:22.08
in fact I made you a fact you're in the spirit auto you're missing another good

1516
02:43:22.08 --> 02:43:26.72
tenacious d reference that I just made but that's kind of a good thing about this is that that's

1517
02:43:26.72 --> 02:43:31.04
not what it is you know how like you'll explain like you know part of it and this is a total

1518
02:43:31.04 --> 02:43:36.80
pair of phrasing situation but you said it in a really good way before when you're like memorize the

1519
02:43:36.80 --> 02:43:42.48
feeling after you're working or something like that see that's like that's not you're not

1520
02:43:42.48 --> 02:43:48.32
inspiring me to go work out you're kind of pragmatically telling me like this is how you mentally

1521
02:43:48.32 --> 02:43:53.84
wage an effective war on that little weakness there that's what it is you know in tracks

1522
02:43:53.84 --> 02:43:58.40
doing this for all kinds of situations called psychological warfare joc go willing that's a good one

rest in recovery it's in there all this stuff is in there it's all in there and there's a

1566
02:48:44.88 --> 02:48:52.96
whole section of like what I'm thinking about on a daily basis so check that out that's the big one

1567
02:48:52.96 --> 02:48:55.84
well like what you're thinking yeah people want to know what the thing about

1568
02:48:55.84 --> 02:49:00.000
big deal for some reason they ask me like what do you think in there I answer it that's why

1569
02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:05.20
wrote that book yeah well like any situation where it's like your face with a decision to do this thing

1570
02:49:05.20 --> 02:49:09.76
and it's hard but you know it has to be done or should be done or whatever and

1571
02:49:10.48 --> 02:49:14.32
so many times where you just when you shift or someone tells you something hey look at it this

1572
02:49:14.32 --> 02:49:18.40
way and you know like my dad would always say do it and it'll be done and it's like thing

1573
02:49:18.40 --> 02:49:24.32
all it took was really thinking a certain way be safe to your Nancy yeah be see be see says do it

1574
02:49:24.32 --> 02:49:30.32
and it's done yeah it's true you get that book from Amazon from Barnes and Noble whatever

1575
02:49:30.32 --> 02:49:36.64
little bookstore is around you go and tell them to get it or you consider around and watch

1576
02:49:36.64 --> 02:49:42.40
life pass you by it's up to you also extreme ownership it's still going strong why is extreme

1577
02:49:42.40 --> 02:49:46.16
ownership still going strong is it because the massive advertising campaign that we put

1578
02:49:46.16 --> 02:49:50.96
under the the uh New York Times and the Wall Street Journal no actually we didn't do that you

1579
02:49:50.96 --> 02:49:55.12
know why it's going strong because of word a mouth that's what it's going strong for because

1580
02:49:55.12 --> 02:49:58.40
one person gets it they buy it for this person that person buys it for someone else that person

1581
02:49:58.40 --> 02:50:02.32
buys it for their team that's why we're still selling that thing like crazy why and why was it

1582
02:50:02.32 --> 02:50:08.96
going through word a mouth because it works functionally works it's not theoretical it is pragmatic

1583
02:50:08.96 --> 02:50:15.52
it's functional it'll make you a better leader and it'll make your team better period we've seen

1584
02:50:15.52 --> 02:50:20.40
this over and over and over again that's why it's selling a lot so get yourself and your team

1585
02:50:20.40 --> 02:50:26.64
so you can implement that and you can win then for your business if your business needs some

1586
