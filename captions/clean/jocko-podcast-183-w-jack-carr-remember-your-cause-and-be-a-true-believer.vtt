00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.44
This is Jockel Podcast number 183.

2
00:00:03.44 --> 00:00:06.04
Burek O'Charles and me, Jockel Winning.

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:07.04
Good evening, Eko.

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.04
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:14.12
Not one of the guys on the ground at like this mission.

6
00:00:14.12 --> 00:00:20.96
Now, moving to within a click of their target, they had pushed that distraction from their minds.

7
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:25.76
And we're solely focused on the deadly challenge before them.

8
00:00:25.76 --> 00:00:30.72
Dancing at the GPS attached to the stock of his rifle and scanning the terrain ahead,

9
00:00:30.72 --> 00:00:34.88
Lieutenant Commander James Rees called a quick perimeter.

10
00:00:34.88 --> 00:00:40.000
Snipers were already moving up to the high ground as team leaders joined Rees for a last

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.28
quick update before the final push to the objective.

12
00:00:45.28 --> 00:00:51.80
Even with all the technology at their disposal, things could go wrong in a heartbeat.

13
00:00:51.80 --> 00:00:56.04
Their enemy was cunning and highly adaptive.

14
00:00:56.04 --> 00:01:03.40
After 16 years at war, the Afghan saying the Americans all have the watches, but we have

15
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:05.88
all the time.

16
00:01:05.88 --> 00:01:10.12
Rang a bit more true than head in the early days.

17
00:01:10.12 --> 00:01:14.20
What do you think Rees asked a huge beast of a man looking like a creature from another

18
00:01:14.20 --> 00:01:20.76
world with his A-O-R-1 patterned camouflage body armor and

19
00:01:20.76 --> 00:01:26.04
ops core half-shell helmet with nods firmly in place?

20
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:31.96
Rees looked at his most seasoned troop chief, the light-green glow of the nods illuminated

21
00:01:31.96 --> 00:01:38.68
through the beard on the man's face, a slight smile that could not be mistaken for anything

22
00:01:38.68 --> 00:01:45.80
other than the confident look of a professional special operations soldier.

23
00:01:45.80 --> 00:01:53.08
Just over the rise, Rees replied, predator shows nothing moving, no centuries, nothing.

24
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:55.56
His troop chief nodded.

25
00:01:55.56 --> 00:02:01.52
All right guys, he said to the other four men in the circle, let's do it.

26
00:02:01.52 --> 00:02:06.92
They rose with resolve and moved with the poise of men who are comfortable in chaos,

27
00:02:06.92 --> 00:02:11.64
moving up the rocky ridge line to get their teams in place before approaching the target

28
00:02:11.64 --> 00:02:14.16
to make entry.

29
00:02:14.16 --> 00:02:15.92
Rees is too easy.

30
00:02:15.92 --> 00:02:17.80
You're thinking too much again.

31
00:02:17.80 --> 00:02:19.64
It's just another mission.

32
00:02:19.64 --> 00:02:23.20
Then why this feeling?

33
00:02:23.20 --> 00:02:25.60
Maybe it's just the headaches.

34
00:02:25.60 --> 00:02:29.80
The headaches had plagued Rees for the past several months, finally prompting a visit to

35
00:02:29.80 --> 00:02:36.20
Balboa Naval Medical Center before this deployment for a series of tests.

36
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:38.16
Still no word back from the docks.

37
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:40.52
Maybe it's nothing.

38
00:02:40.52 --> 00:02:43.60
But maybe it's something.

39
00:02:43.60 --> 00:02:49.40
It's just a long time ago that if something didn't look right, then it probably wasn't.

40
00:02:49.40 --> 00:02:55.20
That judgment had kept him and his man alive on many of deployment.

41
00:02:55.20 --> 00:02:59.04
Everything had lined up a little too easy for this target.

42
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:05.84
The intel, the offset, infill, the current state of the objective area, and why the

43
00:03:05.84 --> 00:03:08.92
pressure from higher authority to go after this target.

44
00:03:08.92 --> 00:03:16.96
When was the last time a flag level command injected itself into a tactical planning process?

45
00:03:16.96 --> 00:03:20.12
Something wasn't added up.

46
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:22.84
Maybe everything's fine.

47
00:03:22.84 --> 00:03:28.08
Maybe it's that, maybe it's a bit of paranoia.

48
00:03:28.08 --> 00:03:31.88
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

49
00:03:31.88 --> 00:03:32.88
Focus.

50
00:03:32.88 --> 00:03:34.88
Rees.

51
00:03:34.88 --> 00:03:39.44
It wasn't the first time that they had approached a target they suspected was a possible

52
00:03:39.44 --> 00:03:40.44
ambush.

53
00:03:40.44 --> 00:03:47.04
At one point in the war, when intel had pointed to the high possibility of an ambush corroborated

54
00:03:47.04 --> 00:03:51.60
by multiple sources, both human and technical, Rees would have knocked on the door with

55
00:03:51.60 --> 00:03:59.04
a thermobaric AT4 or a few 105 rounds from an AC 130 gunship.

56
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:04.80
This was the first time that actual tactics had been dictated from higher.

57
00:04:04.80 --> 00:04:14.20
A man who would not be on the ground, focus on the mission Rees.

58
00:04:14.20 --> 00:04:16.92
One more check with the tactical operations center.

59
00:04:16.92 --> 00:04:24.24
A forward-based command also called the talk and to look at the predator feed.

60
00:04:24.24 --> 00:04:26.52
Nothing.

61
00:04:26.52 --> 00:04:29.16
Another check with the sniper teams.

62
00:04:29.16 --> 00:04:32.28
Nothing moving.

63
00:04:32.28 --> 00:04:37.04
That glanced up at the military crest of the hill in front of him.

64
00:04:37.04 --> 00:04:42.80
Through his nods, he could see the assault teams set and ready to move.

65
00:04:42.80 --> 00:04:50.44
He couldn't see the snipers, which gave him cause for a thoughtful smile.

66
00:04:50.44 --> 00:04:54.16
Best in the business.

67
00:04:54.16 --> 00:05:02.52
Rees keyed his radio and opened his mouth to give the order to move.

68
00:05:02.52 --> 00:05:05.76
Then it all went black.

69
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:10.28
The explosion knocked Rees back ten yards and ripped his helmet from his head as the entire

70
00:05:10.28 --> 00:05:12.72
military crest of the hill in front of him.

71
00:05:12.72 --> 00:05:19.16
He erupted in a concussion of violence and death.

72
00:05:19.16 --> 00:05:27.20
He meets friends, husbands and fathers who one moment earlier had represented the best

73
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:50.52
spots in special operations force in the world were gone in less than a second.

74
00:05:50.52 --> 00:05:59.08
Somewhere a true believer is training to kill you.

75
00:05:59.08 --> 00:06:06.84
He is training with minimum food or water in austere conditions day and night.

76
00:06:06.84 --> 00:06:13.64
The only thing clean on him is his weapon and he made his web gear.

77
00:06:13.64 --> 00:06:22.12
He doesn't worry about what work out to do, his rock weighs, what it weighs, his runs

78
00:06:22.12 --> 00:06:27.88
and when the enemy stops chasing him.

79
00:06:27.88 --> 00:06:32.44
The true believer doesn't care how hard it is.

80
00:06:32.44 --> 00:06:47.96
He only knows that he wins or he dies.

81
00:06:47.96 --> 00:06:57.16
He doesn't go home at 1700.

82
00:06:57.16 --> 00:07:05.64
Those are two excerpts from two books.

83
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:10.40
The second book is called True Believer.

84
00:07:10.40 --> 00:07:14.84
These books are fiction.

85
00:07:14.84 --> 00:07:23.72
They are novels and with the exception of the novel Musashi by Eli Yoshikawa.

86
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:27.84
I have not covered any novels on the podcast.

87
00:07:27.84 --> 00:07:31.76
But I'm actually not here to talk about those novels.

88
00:07:31.76 --> 00:07:36.68
The novels, these books were written by Asio.

89
00:07:36.68 --> 00:07:45.40
Asio that I knew and Asio that is here with us tonight to share his experiences in the

90
00:07:45.40 --> 00:07:55.40
teams.

91
00:07:55.40 --> 00:08:00.76
A father and a writer of fiction.

92
00:08:00.76 --> 00:08:04.52
His name is Jack Carr.

93
00:08:04.52 --> 00:08:05.52
Welcome to the show.

94
00:08:05.52 --> 00:08:07.16
Thank you so much for having me.

95
00:08:07.16 --> 00:08:09.16
It's great to be here.

96
00:08:09.16 --> 00:08:11.60
Good to finally get you out here.

97
00:08:11.60 --> 00:08:13.92
I know we tried to hook this up for a little while.

98
00:08:13.92 --> 00:08:18.24
It's good and you sent me your latest book and I said to myself, okay, well let's just

99
00:08:18.24 --> 00:08:20.24
make this happen.

100
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:21.24
So, yeah, man.

101
00:08:21.24 --> 00:08:22.84
Let's talk a little bit about you.

102
00:08:22.84 --> 00:08:28.36
Well, that's already what I've never heard that True Believer read quite so well.

103
00:08:28.36 --> 00:08:33.88
So I used to read that to my guys in the teams and then read your laws of combat.

104
00:08:33.88 --> 00:08:35.88
Read those to them.

105
00:08:35.88 --> 00:08:39.96
And that one would just set the stage with the series.

106
00:08:39.96 --> 00:08:41.80
Who are going after here?

107
00:08:41.80 --> 00:08:47.32
And your laws of combat, which of course I pass on to everybody I've ever worked with ever

108
00:08:47.32 --> 00:08:48.32
sense.

109
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:49.32
Right.

110
00:08:49.32 --> 00:08:52.60
I probably found a couple of them in the book for those that were there's a couple.

111
00:08:52.60 --> 00:08:56.48
I put them in italics to give you credit.

112
00:08:56.48 --> 00:08:57.48
Jack.

113
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:01.76
So let's talk a little bit about where it all started.

114
00:09:01.76 --> 00:09:03.68
Like what year were you born?

115
00:09:03.68 --> 00:09:04.68
Yeah, 73.

116
00:09:04.68 --> 00:09:07.92
So you're kind of a young and I'm like, well, what do you want?

117
00:09:07.92 --> 00:09:08.92
You're a one year old.

118
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:09.92
71.

119
00:09:09.92 --> 00:09:10.92
Okay.

120
00:09:10.92 --> 00:09:15.68
And in childhood, the 80s though, you know, as this form of years were like 80 to 89.

121
00:09:15.68 --> 00:09:16.88
And you grew up in North Cal.

122
00:09:16.88 --> 00:09:17.88
North Cal.

123
00:09:17.88 --> 00:09:20.16
And my mom was librarian from a very early age.

124
00:09:20.16 --> 00:09:22.56
Were you born in area or city area?

125
00:09:22.56 --> 00:09:23.56
Yeah.

126
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:24.56
Yeah.

127
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:25.56
I'm not too rural.

128
00:09:25.56 --> 00:09:26.56
Small town, I'd say.

129
00:09:26.56 --> 00:09:27.56
Small town.

130
00:09:27.56 --> 00:09:28.56
Yep.

131
00:09:28.56 --> 00:09:30.56
So north of San Francisco.

132
00:09:30.56 --> 00:09:33.16
But today is a D.A.

133
00:09:33.16 --> 00:09:34.16
So probably appropriate.

134
00:09:34.16 --> 00:09:35.16
We talked about that.

135
00:09:35.16 --> 00:09:38.96
My grandfather was killed in World War II, some very early age, surrounded by those silk

136
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:42.20
maps, who's an AV or marine, through the course air, which is that plain.

137
00:09:42.20 --> 00:09:43.20
Yeah.

138
00:09:43.20 --> 00:09:45.32
The goal wings that would fold up.

139
00:09:45.32 --> 00:09:48.84
Right about that time, there was a show black sheep squadron on TV.

140
00:09:48.84 --> 00:09:52.20
I went to an air show and met a pavy bointin before he passed away.

141
00:09:52.20 --> 00:09:53.36
He got his book signed.

142
00:09:53.36 --> 00:09:57.80
And so I always knew that the military was where I was going.

143
00:09:57.80 --> 00:10:00.28
Just earlier on, I didn't know exactly what that was going to be.

144
00:10:00.28 --> 00:10:02.48
But did you ever think about trying to be a pilot?

145
00:10:02.48 --> 00:10:04.28
You know, fleetingly, I'm sure I did.

146
00:10:04.28 --> 00:10:06.20
But do I Marine Corps?

147
00:10:06.20 --> 00:10:10.36
Immediately as a pilot, just to follow in the footsteps of my grandfather.

148
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:15.40
But in a became very obvious that the might skill set lay at a more primal level on the

149
00:10:15.40 --> 00:10:18.32
round, which is attracted to that for some reason.

150
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:21.16
Probably a lot of, well, in the DNA for sure.

151
00:10:21.16 --> 00:10:26.16
But also the influence of popular culture, the books and movies that I read, growing up,

152
00:10:26.16 --> 00:10:30.04
those are the guys that I, that I wanted to be like and had backgrounds that I wanted

153
00:10:30.04 --> 00:10:31.04
to have one day.

154
00:10:31.04 --> 00:10:33.96
But my grandfather didn't make a back from World War II.

155
00:10:33.96 --> 00:10:38.72
He was killed off Okinawa in 1945 in May, so near the end of the war.

156
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:43.80
And his wings made a back, all pictures of his black and white pictures of his squadron

157
00:10:43.80 --> 00:10:47.44
and by his plane, the silk maps they gave a year back then, because they hit the water

158
00:10:47.44 --> 00:10:50.80
with paper, they had just disintegrated, so they had these silk maps.

159
00:10:50.80 --> 00:10:55.04
So I just grew up with him, really, as kind of the ideal hero, I guess.

160
00:10:55.04 --> 00:10:58.96
Obviously, that were met, I'm an either, to my dad, because it was a born-well.

161
00:10:58.96 --> 00:10:59.96
He was deployed.

162
00:10:59.96 --> 00:11:04.24
So, so, grew up with just knowing, took the military with my calling, there was never anything

163
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:05.40
else I wanted to do.

164
00:11:05.40 --> 00:11:08.04
And then, early on, I found out what seals were.

165
00:11:08.04 --> 00:11:09.04
And your mom was a librarian?

166
00:11:09.04 --> 00:11:11.04
Yep, yep, still is to this day.

167
00:11:11.04 --> 00:11:12.44
And so, were you into reading?

168
00:11:12.44 --> 00:11:15.08
Yep, yeah, a group surrounded by books.

169
00:11:15.08 --> 00:11:19.44
And she had just always naturally gravitated when I got to be about fifth grade, I'd say,

170
00:11:19.44 --> 00:11:22.20
towards the things that the adults are reading at the time.

171
00:11:22.20 --> 00:11:27.96
So Tom Clancy, David Morrell, Nelson Demil, AJ Quinnell, J.C. Pollock, Mark Olden,

172
00:11:27.96 --> 00:11:32.88
these guys in the 80s that had protagonist with seal backgrounds or CIA backgrounds or

173
00:11:32.88 --> 00:11:34.16
a special forces background.

174
00:11:34.16 --> 00:11:40.12
So, not having the internet and not having that many non-fiction books written about seals.

175
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:41.12
That's what I read.

176
00:11:41.12 --> 00:11:42.96
And I knew this is where I'm going.

177
00:11:42.96 --> 00:11:46.48
And then after that's done, I want to write fiction like these guys.

178
00:11:46.48 --> 00:11:48.88
So those are the two things that I wanted to do with my life.

179
00:11:48.88 --> 00:11:52.68
How old were you and you actually found out about the seal teams in fifth grade?

180
00:11:52.68 --> 00:11:55.64
Seven, so second grade.

181
00:11:55.64 --> 00:11:56.64
Second grade?

182
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64
Yep, you found out about the seal teams?

183
00:11:57.64 --> 00:11:58.64
Yep, from what?

184
00:11:58.64 --> 00:12:01.36
So back then there were four channels back then growing up.

185
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:06.36
So there was ABC, CBS, NBC, and then that one outlier channel that always had some, we're

186
00:12:06.36 --> 00:12:08.96
the more two movie on it going all the time.

187
00:12:08.96 --> 00:12:11.56
And I was at a remote control back in the late 70s.

188
00:12:11.56 --> 00:12:14.08
So the Sundays were football days.

189
00:12:14.08 --> 00:12:16.28
And I was not interested in football at all.

190
00:12:16.28 --> 00:12:19.60
But I was interested in that warm movie to have planned opposite football.

191
00:12:19.60 --> 00:12:22.12
So at a commercial, my dad would look at his watch.

192
00:12:22.12 --> 00:12:24.96
And I can still remember it to this day, sit on the couch and he said, go.

193
00:12:24.96 --> 00:12:29.44
And I'd have two minutes to run up, change that channel to that outlier channel.

194
00:12:29.44 --> 00:12:33.76
And then sit back down, watch that movie, and then he, say, turn it back back to football

195
00:12:33.76 --> 00:12:34.76
two minutes later.

196
00:12:34.76 --> 00:12:35.76
So I got to do that.

197
00:12:35.76 --> 00:12:39.12
And then I just went through the football parts and then run up and change it to whatever

198
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:40.12
warm movie was planned.

199
00:12:40.12 --> 00:12:42.92
So this car is an attention deficit disorder without question.

200
00:12:42.92 --> 00:12:43.92
Maybe he has the train.

201
00:12:43.92 --> 00:12:46.40
He has the incredible patience and imagination.

202
00:12:46.40 --> 00:12:48.40
You got to fill in the blanks, direct that.

203
00:12:48.40 --> 00:12:49.40
That might be it.

204
00:12:49.40 --> 00:12:50.40
That might be it.

205
00:12:50.40 --> 00:12:53.40
And yeah, so one of those movies was the frogman.

206
00:12:53.40 --> 00:12:57.96
It showed these guys climb up over the beaches ahead of a conventional force landing

207
00:12:57.96 --> 00:13:00.44
and put an explosives on these obstacles.

208
00:13:00.44 --> 00:13:02.96
And I asked my dad, hey, who are these guys?

209
00:13:02.96 --> 00:13:04.32
And he said those are frogmen.

210
00:13:04.32 --> 00:13:06.08
And he said, okay, what's a frogman?

211
00:13:06.08 --> 00:13:07.80
He said, ask your mother.

212
00:13:07.80 --> 00:13:08.80
So I did.

213
00:13:08.80 --> 00:13:12.80
And then we went down to the local library because she would take any excuse to get us to the

214
00:13:12.80 --> 00:13:13.80
library and do research.

215
00:13:13.80 --> 00:13:17.40
Show us how to use the do-ey-destinal system, pull out the card, things, the whole deal,

216
00:13:17.40 --> 00:13:19.000
and did a little research.

217
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.16
And there was hardly anything written back then.

218
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:24.76
There was a couple magazines that had mentions of seals, a couple nonfiction books that

219
00:13:24.76 --> 00:13:27.08
had a chapter or a paragraph or two on seals.

220
00:13:27.08 --> 00:13:28.08
It was not much at all.

221
00:13:28.08 --> 00:13:29.08
Not much at all.

222
00:13:29.08 --> 00:13:33.36
And but my takeaway was that these guys are touted anyway as one of the most elite

223
00:13:33.36 --> 00:13:35.04
fighting forces in the world.

224
00:13:35.04 --> 00:13:37.96
And the training is the toughest ever-devised biomatering military.

225
00:13:37.96 --> 00:13:38.96
Arguably.

226
00:13:38.96 --> 00:13:39.96
That was my deal.

227
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:40.96
That was my deal.

228
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:41.96
That was my deal.

229
00:13:41.96 --> 00:13:42.96
That was my deal.

230
00:13:42.96 --> 00:13:43.96
That was my deal.

231
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:44.96
That was my deal.

232
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:45.96
That's the same thing.

233
00:13:45.96 --> 00:13:46.96
We all know that's an arguable name.

234
00:13:46.96 --> 00:13:47.96
Exactly.

235
00:13:47.96 --> 00:13:48.96
There's all kinds of different heart parts of all different training.

236
00:13:48.96 --> 00:13:51.36
Did go eat Nemori, one Emori a day.

237
00:13:51.36 --> 00:13:52.96
I would not be a happy camper.

238
00:13:52.96 --> 00:13:56.56
But so everyone's got their little, their little challenges.

239
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.16
I heard the same thing.

240
00:13:58.16 --> 00:13:59.16
Exactly.

241
00:13:59.16 --> 00:14:00.16
And yeah.

242
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:00.96
And you find out that it's a-

243
00:14:00.96 --> 00:14:02.36
So what did you do?

244
00:14:02.36 --> 00:14:04.76
Did you start preparing for it physically?

245
00:14:04.76 --> 00:14:05.76
Yep.

246
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:06.76
Oh yeah.

247
00:14:06.76 --> 00:14:07.76
Everything I did from that.

248
00:14:07.76 --> 00:14:10.16
So I guess I did an early form of crossfit.

249
00:14:10.16 --> 00:14:11.16
I guess.

250
00:14:11.16 --> 00:14:13.96
Before a crossfit was the thing in high school.

251
00:14:13.96 --> 00:14:17.80
So not in the younger years, you know, how I was to play in soccer,

252
00:14:17.80 --> 00:14:19.60
running around cross country, doing all that sort of.

253
00:14:19.60 --> 00:14:22.000
But I do credit cross country in those hills,

254
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.20
and Northern California, with given me four

255
00:14:24.20 --> 00:14:26.20
memories in that no never quit.

256
00:14:26.20 --> 00:14:28.000
I see people stop it on the hill that was giving me.

257
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.40
And would you like a pretty good runner?

258
00:14:29.40 --> 00:14:30.20
I was okay.

259
00:14:30.20 --> 00:14:31.20
Yeah, it was good.

260
00:14:31.20 --> 00:14:33.40
But there were some guys that were really, really good.

261
00:14:33.40 --> 00:14:36.40
Mine was just, you know, dog and determination, really.

262
00:14:36.40 --> 00:14:39.20
So I was pretty good, but not the greatest.

263
00:14:39.20 --> 00:14:41.80
And you know, but I love it when I'd see people walking,

264
00:14:41.80 --> 00:14:42.60
especially on the hills.

265
00:14:42.60 --> 00:14:44.60
When people from the flat lands would come up to our horse

266
00:14:44.60 --> 00:14:47.20
and they put that first hill and just a walk,

267
00:14:47.20 --> 00:14:48.20
we would just devastate them.

268
00:14:48.20 --> 00:14:50.60
And that which is I just feed off that kind of like in a week

269
00:14:50.60 --> 00:14:53.000
when people would quit and I always feel bad talking about this.

270
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
But I mean, it's true.

271
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Some people would say, come back, no, don't quit.

272
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Come back.

273
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.20
I didn't say one or see this later.

274
00:14:59.20 --> 00:15:00.40
This is so solid.

275
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:01.000
Exactly.

276
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.80
This is what this program is designed to do.

277
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:05.60
And so I kind of fed off that I guess.

278
00:15:05.60 --> 00:15:06.000
I love this.

279
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.90
Especially when the biggest strongest fastest guys for those first three

280
00:15:08.90 --> 00:15:12.000
weeks or whatever it was, but what's the first couple?

281
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
What's the first couple?

282
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.20
Just, just quitting first couple hours.

283
00:15:15.20 --> 00:15:15.80
I don't know.

284
00:15:15.80 --> 00:15:18.20
People said that was going to happen and it did.

285
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:21.000
And I'm just studs where I thought to myself, wow, this guy

286
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.80
seems like a complete stud mentally physically.

287
00:15:25.80 --> 00:15:29.60
Just legit and then just go way to go right away.

288
00:15:29.60 --> 00:15:30.60
How is that?

289
00:15:30.60 --> 00:15:32.20
I don't know, but I would look at these guys when I first

290
00:15:32.20 --> 00:15:33.40
showed up the buds and like, man, like,

291
00:15:33.40 --> 00:15:36.80
I shoot out and he's doing crazy climbing these ropes.

292
00:15:36.80 --> 00:15:39.80
He's like, oh my, can look at him going those monkey bar

293
00:15:39.80 --> 00:15:43.20
things and chase how am I going to make it through if this guy

294
00:15:43.20 --> 00:15:45.80
like, like, like that here and he quits.

295
00:15:45.80 --> 00:15:47.20
I'm like, oh, I see how this works.

296
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:50.000
Yeah, you're men I get weak exactly.

297
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I can do this.

298
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.40
So, so you did running?

299
00:15:53.40 --> 00:15:55.000
Yeah, you did cross the country.

300
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Yeah, early on, did that stuff soccer.

301
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.60
The cross in high school.

302
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:02.000
But then I'd ride my bike to school, which was, I don't know,

303
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.40
how I like at least 10 miles I guess.

304
00:16:04.40 --> 00:16:09.20
So early morning, the California cold and because I was part of training

305
00:16:09.20 --> 00:16:14.20
and I'd get home and we have this kind of place at whatever from one of our kids.

306
00:16:14.20 --> 00:16:17.20
And I do pull up so I'll be holding different,

307
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:21.000
trying to make an obstacle course for myself when I got home.

308
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.20
And I would be knocking out like 20 pull ups at whatever 13, 14 years old.

309
00:16:25.20 --> 00:16:29.80
And then go have like some pasta or a piece of bread with butter on it

310
00:16:29.80 --> 00:16:30.60
for my snack.

311
00:16:30.60 --> 00:16:31.60
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:16:31.60 --> 00:16:36.60
And start training, start training martial arts pretty early too.

313
00:16:36.60 --> 00:16:41.40
But I was searching because local Taiwan dope place, right?

314
00:16:41.40 --> 00:16:43.80
And you're doing some kada stuff and you're doing a little bit.

315
00:16:43.80 --> 00:16:46.80
Can you even hear how old were you?

316
00:16:46.80 --> 00:16:49.20
That would probably be fresh, but I was 14, let's say.

317
00:16:49.20 --> 00:16:52.000
So even as a 14 year old, you're like, wow.

318
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.20
Like this seems like it may work, but it also seems like,

319
00:16:56.20 --> 00:16:58.000
what if someone hits me in the face?

320
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.80
Yeah, yeah, work.

321
00:16:59.80 --> 00:17:00.80
Right.

322
00:17:00.80 --> 00:17:01.80
13 year old.

323
00:17:01.80 --> 00:17:02.80
Yeah, kind of picked up on that.

324
00:17:02.80 --> 00:17:04.80
Yeah, which is, I give you credit.

325
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:06.80
Well, because I'm guys can be convincing.

326
00:17:06.80 --> 00:17:11.40
You know, yeah, that's how you see these videos of people online that are making

327
00:17:11.40 --> 00:17:15.80
people fall down by a pointing out of middle area, yelling their key eye out of them.

328
00:17:15.80 --> 00:17:16.80
I know, it's very nice.

329
00:17:16.80 --> 00:17:20.60
People literally fall down and start shaking.

330
00:17:20.60 --> 00:17:21.60
It's crazy.

331
00:17:21.60 --> 00:17:22.60
Yeah, it's crazy.

332
00:17:22.60 --> 00:17:23.80
But I can add grew up also.

333
00:17:23.80 --> 00:17:24.60
Like, talk about that.

334
00:17:24.60 --> 00:17:26.80
It's the influence of popular culture.

335
00:17:26.80 --> 00:17:28.80
So Rocky movies.

336
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:31.80
I was just, wow, man, that's fighting right there.

337
00:17:31.80 --> 00:17:32.80
I want to learn how to do that.

338
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:34.80
How do I learn how to do that and know what I'm going to call for you?

339
00:17:34.80 --> 00:17:36.80
Well, there wasn't really a place to go.

340
00:17:36.80 --> 00:17:40.96
But that, that, that, that, tenacity, you know, they get enough every time you get knocked

341
00:17:40.96 --> 00:17:41.96
down.

342
00:17:41.96 --> 00:17:43.60
Like, I think those things really wore off on me.

343
00:17:43.60 --> 00:17:47.000
Like, I took that seriously and still do to this day.

344
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.60
What kind of music were you listening to?

345
00:17:48.60 --> 00:17:51.60
I didn't really do the music thing to the last few years.

346
00:17:51.60 --> 00:17:52.60
Really?

347
00:17:52.60 --> 00:17:53.60
It was like quite.

348
00:17:53.60 --> 00:17:54.60
Yep.

349
00:17:54.60 --> 00:17:58.40
I realized I'm starting to give music less credit than I used to.

350
00:17:58.40 --> 00:18:01.60
First, I used to look, I used to, when I meet people and I talk to them for a little

351
00:18:01.60 --> 00:18:02.60
bit.

352
00:18:02.60 --> 00:18:04.40
I mean, music did you listen to grown up?

353
00:18:04.40 --> 00:18:10.000
Because it would always kind of fill me in about kind of who they were because when

354
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.64
we grew up, you, you only listen to what you kind of, you, you didn't get exposed to a

355
00:18:14.64 --> 00:18:15.64
bunch of stuff.

356
00:18:15.64 --> 00:18:18.48
You kind of had to figure it out and go down that channel.

357
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:22.68
And so if you listen to heavy metal, okay, I see, you know, I see what you do.

358
00:18:22.68 --> 00:18:26.36
And or you listen to, you know, Leonard Skinner, okay, cool, I get where I get.

359
00:18:26.36 --> 00:18:28.80
I could, you could just kind of know because people wouldn't say, because what does

360
00:18:28.80 --> 00:18:30.000
everyone say now, what do you listen to?

361
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.88
They say everything, because everything's free.

362
00:18:31.88 --> 00:18:34.48
They can listen to all this different kinds and it's just wide open.

363
00:18:34.48 --> 00:18:36.96
And that's what all these kids say nowadays.

364
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:39.80
Oh, I listen to everything, a little bit of everything.

365
00:18:39.80 --> 00:18:41.16
And so don't offend anyone.

366
00:18:41.16 --> 00:18:42.16
Yeah.

367
00:18:42.16 --> 00:18:43.16
Yeah.

368
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:44.16
And so you just weren't even in the music.

369
00:18:44.16 --> 00:18:46.76
No, not until I got my driver's license and then I got, you know, had to because

370
00:18:46.76 --> 00:18:48.92
you had other people in the car and they bring a cassette tape.

371
00:18:48.92 --> 00:18:52.32
I'm going to make a mixed tape and put that thing in.

372
00:18:52.32 --> 00:18:56.16
And for whatever reason, when I grew up, people listened to stuff like 60s, 70s.

373
00:18:56.16 --> 00:18:57.16
That's the same thing.

374
00:18:57.16 --> 00:19:05.44
Well, my dad had a baricuda and the car, like the sports car, like a set of three

375
00:19:05.44 --> 00:19:09.28
baricuda yellow with and you're saying it impressed.

376
00:19:09.28 --> 00:19:10.28
Yeah.

377
00:19:10.28 --> 00:19:15.68
But it was not because it was my dad being a broke teacher, needed a new car and

378
00:19:15.68 --> 00:19:20.76
went out and paid whatever 1, 1800 bucks for this car that was rusty, but it had an

379
00:19:20.76 --> 00:19:21.76
eight track in it.

380
00:19:21.76 --> 00:19:22.76
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:22.76 --> 00:19:25.76
And my dad, I think he had one eight track and it was Hank Williams.

382
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:27.12
Like Hank, well, that's it.

383
00:19:27.12 --> 00:19:28.56
Yeah, Hank Williams senior.

384
00:19:28.56 --> 00:19:31.20
So we listened to a lot of Hank Williams when I was growing up.

385
00:19:31.20 --> 00:19:32.36
We had Kenny Rogers.

386
00:19:32.36 --> 00:19:33.36
Yeah.

387
00:19:33.36 --> 00:19:34.36
We had the gambler.

388
00:19:34.36 --> 00:19:35.36
I'm sorry to hear that.

389
00:19:35.36 --> 00:19:36.72
We had the gambler every morning.

390
00:19:36.72 --> 00:19:37.72
I got off for school.

391
00:19:37.72 --> 00:19:38.72
Wasn't an eight track.

392
00:19:38.72 --> 00:19:39.88
I think my dad was an early adopter.

393
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:42.92
But he's very good because yeah, he got a good sense with the cassette player.

394
00:19:42.92 --> 00:19:43.92
Exactly.

395
00:19:43.92 --> 00:19:46.72
And I remember this day every day on the way to school was the gambler.

396
00:19:46.72 --> 00:19:47.72
Yeah.

397
00:19:47.72 --> 00:19:48.72
All right.

398
00:19:48.72 --> 00:19:49.92
So what did your dad do?

399
00:19:49.92 --> 00:19:52.68
I was in attorney at that time and then got into real estate.

400
00:19:52.68 --> 00:19:55.92
Probably later on and then retired early.

401
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:59.24
So okay, so you're now at what point did you say?

402
00:19:59.24 --> 00:20:02.40
Okay, I'm going to, I'm going to go for sure.

403
00:20:02.40 --> 00:20:04.12
Like what point was this 10 years old?

404
00:20:04.12 --> 00:20:05.12
Was this 12 years old?

405
00:20:05.12 --> 00:20:06.12
Seven, seven years old.

406
00:20:06.12 --> 00:20:07.12
All right.

407
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:08.12
Yeah, this is what I'm doing.

408
00:20:08.12 --> 00:20:12.24
And what made you decide anything else significant from high school?

409
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:14.000
Your playing soccer, your playing the cross.

410
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yeah.

411
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Run and pull ups on the monkey.

412
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Back in forever.

413
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Trail running.

414
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.68
All that sort of thing is getting ready thinking about my next steps.

415
00:20:21.68 --> 00:20:24.20
And no one that there was going to be a little bit of pause there to go to college

416
00:20:24.20 --> 00:20:27.28
first, just in case because we have to have contingency plans to share.

417
00:20:27.28 --> 00:20:29.84
So you looked and said like, okay, I'm going to go to college.

418
00:20:29.84 --> 00:20:30.84
Yeah.

419
00:20:30.84 --> 00:20:31.84
Yeah.

420
00:20:31.84 --> 00:20:36.36
That's what I need to do that because I need to get stronger, bigger, faster.

421
00:20:36.36 --> 00:20:37.84
And I thought I needed to do anyone else.

422
00:20:37.84 --> 00:20:39.04
I don't know if that's the case or not.

423
00:20:39.04 --> 00:20:40.04
But probably not.

424
00:20:40.04 --> 00:20:43.80
But you were just more humble and you were saying, hey, I need to be in better shape.

425
00:20:43.80 --> 00:20:46.16
And I thought there was eight guys on a seal team.

426
00:20:46.16 --> 00:20:48.96
And I was going to be one of those guys and if I was going to be one of those guys, I

427
00:20:48.96 --> 00:20:51.24
needed to be in the best possible shape.

428
00:20:51.24 --> 00:20:56.72
And at that time, the best possible shape looked like Stallone and looked like Arnold.

429
00:20:56.72 --> 00:20:59.40
So I did not look like either of those guys.

430
00:20:59.40 --> 00:21:00.40
And I still don't.

431
00:21:00.40 --> 00:21:01.40
I never did.

432
00:21:01.40 --> 00:21:04.16
But I thought, I needed to hit the iron here.

433
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:05.84
I need to get boxing.

434
00:21:05.84 --> 00:21:08.16
And I did a little bit in high school.

435
00:21:08.16 --> 00:21:12.72
So back to that martial arts school, the Taekwondo thing that was an instructor there.

436
00:21:12.72 --> 00:21:13.72
It's kind of new.

437
00:21:13.72 --> 00:21:15.16
This wasn't quite the deal.

438
00:21:15.16 --> 00:21:17.60
Like a brown belt in Taekwondo.

439
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:20.44
And then from my last, I guess, you're in a half of high school.

440
00:21:20.44 --> 00:21:22.08
He wanted to start his own thing.

441
00:21:22.08 --> 00:21:24.88
And so I go pick him up in my car because you didn't have one.

442
00:21:24.88 --> 00:21:26.16
And we go to the local park.

443
00:21:26.16 --> 00:21:27.16
And we boxed.

444
00:21:27.16 --> 00:21:30.16
And it was like, jab reverse hook.

445
00:21:30.16 --> 00:21:32.20
And then I gave him the basics.

446
00:21:32.20 --> 00:21:33.92
And that was awesome.

447
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:35.20
One, two, three.

448
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:36.20
I absolutely love it.

449
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:37.20
That was the largest 24 hours.

450
00:21:37.20 --> 00:21:38.20
Yes.

451
00:21:38.20 --> 00:21:39.20
Exactly.

452
00:21:39.20 --> 00:21:40.20
The one tuned through.

453
00:21:40.20 --> 00:21:42.48
My learned about it, Taekwondo was, you know, like, because he did some wrestling.

454
00:21:42.48 --> 00:21:44.20
Oh, so I had to do a little of that.

455
00:21:44.20 --> 00:21:45.20
This guy was early MMA.

456
00:21:45.20 --> 00:21:46.20
Exactly.

457
00:21:46.20 --> 00:21:47.20
Exactly.

458
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:48.20
Yep.

459
00:21:48.20 --> 00:21:49.20
He told me he had a car.

460
00:21:49.20 --> 00:21:50.20
Yeah.

461
00:21:50.20 --> 00:21:51.20
He was a good early MMA subman.

462
00:21:51.20 --> 00:21:52.20
That's such a great thing.

463
00:21:52.20 --> 00:21:53.20
And he's still doing it today.

464
00:21:53.20 --> 00:21:54.20
Yeah.

465
00:21:54.20 --> 00:21:56.44
Mike Valentine is now in cinema and you hear his buddy has a place up in New

466
00:21:56.44 --> 00:21:57.44
California.

467
00:21:57.44 --> 00:21:58.44
And he's still doing it.

468
00:21:58.44 --> 00:22:01.12
And as soon as he found out about your Getsu, he was doing that.

469
00:22:01.12 --> 00:22:02.12
Oh, good for him.

470
00:22:02.12 --> 00:22:06.04
He was driving a San Francisco and working out with whoever was the San Francisco guy in the

471
00:22:06.04 --> 00:22:07.04
early 90s, I guess.

472
00:22:07.04 --> 00:22:08.04
And yes.

473
00:22:08.04 --> 00:22:09.04
Yes.

474
00:22:09.04 --> 00:22:10.04
We were talking about health.

475
00:22:10.04 --> 00:22:11.04
Gracie.

476
00:22:11.04 --> 00:22:12.04
I don't know.

477
00:22:12.04 --> 00:22:13.04
Charles Gracie, babe.

478
00:22:13.04 --> 00:22:14.04
There's a bunch of options up there.

479
00:22:14.04 --> 00:22:15.04
Yeah.

480
00:22:15.04 --> 00:22:16.04
But nobody was really doing that.

481
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:17.04
Nobody was mixing stuff up like that.

482
00:22:17.04 --> 00:22:18.04
I knew about anyway.

483
00:22:18.04 --> 00:22:22.12
My little town of whatever, you know, of many people that was.

484
00:22:22.12 --> 00:22:23.40
But then I just kept on that path.

485
00:22:23.40 --> 00:22:26.08
Just kept on I thought it was going to be a lifelong path.

486
00:22:26.08 --> 00:22:28.52
And but I peaked in about 95.

487
00:22:28.52 --> 00:22:29.52
And that was in college.

488
00:22:29.52 --> 00:22:30.52
Yeah.

489
00:22:30.52 --> 00:22:31.52
So you end up going to college.

490
00:22:31.52 --> 00:22:33.28
What do you go to study college for?

491
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:35.80
Well, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.

492
00:22:35.80 --> 00:22:37.52
So I get to the seal teams.

493
00:22:37.52 --> 00:22:39.96
And so justice studies seem to be criminology.

494
00:22:39.96 --> 00:22:44.08
It seemed to be the thing that you could just, hey, that's kind of interesting.

495
00:22:44.08 --> 00:22:46.92
And I can get through this thing in four years and get to the teams.

496
00:22:46.92 --> 00:22:50.04
And your backup plan would have been some kind of cop or something like that.

497
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:53.36
I guess, but I didn't really waste too much time thinking about a backup plan.

498
00:22:53.36 --> 00:22:56.32
I just knew that college having that degree was the backup plan.

499
00:22:56.32 --> 00:22:57.76
But I'd figure that out later.

500
00:22:57.76 --> 00:23:01.60
It was full on devoted to figuring out how to get to the teams.

501
00:23:01.60 --> 00:23:05.60
And then being the best shape, I could mentally physically spiritually before I got there.

502
00:23:05.60 --> 00:23:09.40
When did you go to a recruiter, what year of college after I finished?

503
00:23:09.40 --> 00:23:10.40
After you finished college?

504
00:23:10.40 --> 00:23:12.40
I thought it was going to be like four years ago.

505
00:23:12.40 --> 00:23:15.84
Like you go to the recruiter and there's a bus waiting outside and you walk through and

506
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:17.08
you get on the bus and off you go.

507
00:23:17.08 --> 00:23:18.68
I know totally ignorant.

508
00:23:18.68 --> 00:23:19.68
Yeah, it's crazy.

509
00:23:19.68 --> 00:23:21.32
It's very weird until you do it.

510
00:23:21.32 --> 00:23:24.20
Well, I did research enough to find out that there was something called a die of

511
00:23:24.20 --> 00:23:25.20
ferro program.

512
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:28.08
And my recruiter didn't even know what it was.

513
00:23:28.08 --> 00:23:31.32
But I was in the back of a book and I forget the name of the book, a paperback book,

514
00:23:31.32 --> 00:23:33.52
the talk about all sorts of different special operations.

515
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:37.000
And I had like one paragraph on how to get to those places.

516
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.44
But the seal, it said die of ferro program.

517
00:23:39.44 --> 00:23:40.44
So I went in there.

518
00:23:40.44 --> 00:23:42.44
It was kind of a scam.

519
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:43.92
I did that program too.

520
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:46.52
Total scam. Like they get you to sign on for six years.

521
00:23:46.52 --> 00:23:50.56
And they said you guaranteed a chance to try out.

522
00:23:50.56 --> 00:23:51.56
Yeah, that's all I need.

523
00:23:51.56 --> 00:23:52.56
That's what I want.

524
00:23:52.56 --> 00:23:53.56
I want the guaranteed to try out.

525
00:23:53.56 --> 00:23:54.56
That's all I need.

526
00:23:54.56 --> 00:23:58.40
And then you get to bootcamp and everybody got a chance and when I was there anyway.

527
00:23:58.40 --> 00:23:59.40
To try out.

528
00:23:59.40 --> 00:24:00.68
I signed up for six.

529
00:24:00.68 --> 00:24:03.52
These guys for four and we all get the chance to ding it.

530
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:06.24
But anyway, ended up spending the 20 years in anyway.

531
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:06.88
Yeah.

532
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:10.04
So what year was it that you actually listed in the Navy?

533
00:24:10.04 --> 00:24:11.04
96.

534
00:24:11.04 --> 00:24:11.68
96.

535
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:13.84
So got an I thought like I said a thousand of walk.

536
00:24:13.84 --> 00:24:14.84
I don't know that bus.

537
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:16.72
And then I'm training and I roll my ankle.

538
00:24:16.72 --> 00:24:18.88
And I'm like oh man, that's going to be the end.

539
00:24:18.88 --> 00:24:20.32
And I can't believe it's like this huge.

540
00:24:20.32 --> 00:24:23.56
I thought it was broken and it'd up just been whatever.

541
00:24:23.56 --> 00:24:24.56
That's brave.

542
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:25.56
Yeah, nothing.

543
00:24:25.56 --> 00:24:26.56
That must be what ever.

544
00:24:26.56 --> 00:24:28.52
It's how like blue 21.

545
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:31.28
And yeah, so you think like I think it's black and blue ankle.

546
00:24:31.28 --> 00:24:32.28
It's huge.

547
00:24:32.28 --> 00:24:34.28
And it's like oh man, what did I do?

548
00:24:34.28 --> 00:24:35.28
I was trying to run.

549
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:36.28
Why was I training that day?

550
00:24:36.28 --> 00:24:37.80
I should have just been just relaxed.

551
00:24:37.80 --> 00:24:38.80
Not gotten hurt.

552
00:24:38.80 --> 00:24:42.40
And then so I'm going to crush this for a couple of months and then go back after it.

553
00:24:42.40 --> 00:24:43.56
And got the pool.

554
00:24:43.56 --> 00:24:48.56
How long was it from the time you enlisted until the time you shipped out?

555
00:24:48.56 --> 00:24:51.72
Gosh, you know, there's all those things you're supposed to do ahead of time when you're

556
00:24:51.72 --> 00:24:52.72
on.

557
00:24:52.72 --> 00:24:54.72
For the call, you're supposed to be going to classes.

558
00:24:54.72 --> 00:24:55.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
00:24:55.72 --> 00:24:56.72
I didn't do any of that.

560
00:24:56.72 --> 00:24:59.32
I didn't do any of that stuff though because it was encouraged.

561
00:24:59.32 --> 00:25:01.56
But I somewhere I found out it was not mandatory.

562
00:25:01.56 --> 00:25:04.56
And I was like okay good because I don't want to have to, you know, do whatever.

563
00:25:04.56 --> 00:25:05.56
These 10 pushups with these people.

564
00:25:05.56 --> 00:25:06.80
I need to be actually training.

565
00:25:06.80 --> 00:25:08.80
Was it a month though?

566
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:09.80
No, it was.

567
00:25:09.80 --> 00:25:10.80
It was months.

568
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:11.80
Yeah, it was years.

569
00:25:11.80 --> 00:25:12.80
No, it was like five months.

570
00:25:12.80 --> 00:25:13.80
Or something like that.

571
00:25:13.80 --> 00:25:15.40
That's just like a little heads up to people.

572
00:25:15.40 --> 00:25:18.12
Like you think what like what you thought, which is what I thought.

573
00:25:18.12 --> 00:25:20.80
Hey, once I sign up, I'm just going to get on a bus.

574
00:25:20.80 --> 00:25:21.80
That's cool.

575
00:25:21.80 --> 00:25:22.80
I'm good.

576
00:25:22.80 --> 00:25:25.80
And really you get to go survive for another five months.

577
00:25:25.80 --> 00:25:27.24
You're saying, what's as you're waiting to go?

578
00:25:27.24 --> 00:25:29.96
Because you have certain billets allowed and all this stuff.

579
00:25:29.96 --> 00:25:30.96
So it's kind of a pain.

580
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:32.40
Yep, and you got to do the medical stuff.

581
00:25:32.40 --> 00:25:33.40
The dental stuff.

582
00:25:33.40 --> 00:25:34.40
Take the ad.

583
00:25:34.40 --> 00:25:35.40
Bad.

584
00:25:35.40 --> 00:25:36.68
And all that sort of thing to get ready.

585
00:25:36.68 --> 00:25:40.44
So those, I think a couple trips over the main recruiting station to do all those sorts of

586
00:25:40.44 --> 00:25:44.24
things, get out of the paperwork and line, and then off you go.

587
00:25:44.24 --> 00:25:47.20
And then I was, and now they have every, all the people that are going to be in some sort

588
00:25:47.20 --> 00:25:49.20
of naval special warfare.

589
00:25:49.20 --> 00:25:50.20
Yeah, something.

590
00:25:50.20 --> 00:25:51.20
It's more square to wear.

591
00:25:51.20 --> 00:25:57.48
Yeah, they go through like, they go to Chicago, I think, for eight weeks.

592
00:25:57.48 --> 00:25:58.88
So get ready for bugs.

593
00:25:58.88 --> 00:25:59.88
Yep.

594
00:25:59.88 --> 00:26:00.88
So you shut up to bugs.

595
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:01.88
Were you ready for bugs?

596
00:26:01.88 --> 00:26:04.32
As always, this ready is one could possibly be.

597
00:26:04.32 --> 00:26:06.12
With all that training and all that thought.

598
00:26:06.12 --> 00:26:07.36
And then I knew, hey, there's no way I'm quitting.

599
00:26:07.36 --> 00:26:11.32
It's all my friends growing up knew that I wanted to do this until it's seven.

600
00:26:11.32 --> 00:26:13.16
And so there's no way I'm quit him and die.

601
00:26:13.16 --> 00:26:15.40
I can't go home and tell him I didn't make it.

602
00:26:15.40 --> 00:26:18.56
You know what's weird is people do that right there, and they still quit.

603
00:26:18.56 --> 00:26:20.68
Yeah, which boggles my mind.

604
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:26.16
I, the, the, the quitting thing is hard for me to comprehend.

605
00:26:26.16 --> 00:26:30.000
And when I hear about people doing it, look, people like that, you know, there was a guy

606
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.88
that killed himself recently.

607
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:33.60
And he was that guy.

608
00:26:33.60 --> 00:26:37.64
And he had told everyone I'm going to be a seal and he had trained for it and he prepared

609
00:26:37.64 --> 00:26:39.04
for it and he looked like a stud.

610
00:26:39.04 --> 00:26:41.28
He looked like a beast of a kid.

611
00:26:41.28 --> 00:26:45.36
And he played lacrosse and he was varsity this and captain of that.

612
00:26:45.36 --> 00:26:51.52
I mean, and then he got two bugs and for whatever reason, he quit and then he, and then

613
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:53.40
he killed himself.

614
00:26:53.40 --> 00:27:00.24
And you just think, man, like, whatever they're telling you in bugs, you don't quit.

615
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:03.04
He said, you know, just don't quit.

616
00:27:03.04 --> 00:27:04.04
It's pretty easy.

617
00:27:04.04 --> 00:27:06.12
Yeah, just do not quit.

618
00:27:06.12 --> 00:27:11.32
And I know they play psychological games on people of saying, you know, let's say, you

619
00:27:11.32 --> 00:27:13.40
don't belong here and all this kind of stuff.

620
00:27:13.40 --> 00:27:16.16
I don't even remember if they said that to me, I didn't care what they said to me.

621
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:20.40
It wasn't even, kind of, trading, anything in my brain.

622
00:27:20.40 --> 00:27:21.40
But you know, that's what they do.

623
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.96
They'll say, oh, you don't belong here.

624
00:27:22.96 --> 00:27:24.52
We don't want you on the team.

625
00:27:24.52 --> 00:27:30.64
And somebody that's sensitive to that, it can get through to share and make them start believing

626
00:27:30.64 --> 00:27:33.000
that the instructors actually, the instructors are going to leave.

627
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
We even go order a pizza.

628
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.84
They're not actually thinking about that, you know?

629
00:27:36.84 --> 00:27:38.48
But they take some get and they quit.

630
00:27:38.48 --> 00:27:39.48
And you know what?

631
00:27:39.48 --> 00:27:40.48
Good.

632
00:27:40.48 --> 00:27:41.48
Like you said, like, good.

633
00:27:41.48 --> 00:27:45.48
If someone has that, if someone is going to quit, please quit during bugs.

634
00:27:45.48 --> 00:27:46.48
Yeah, for sure.

635
00:27:46.48 --> 00:27:48.88
Did you guys watch a full-metal jacket?

636
00:27:48.88 --> 00:27:52.48
I mean, all these movies that they show, join instructors on what it's like.

637
00:27:52.48 --> 00:27:53.48
And it's like a game.

638
00:27:53.48 --> 00:27:54.48
Yeah, you're going to be a game.

639
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:57.72
Did you have any trouble with anything about bugs?

640
00:27:57.72 --> 00:28:02.60
So I swam before I got there and I'd wake up super early and meet the Master Swim

641
00:28:02.60 --> 00:28:06.28
program at five in the morning because I knew swimming was my weak point.

642
00:28:06.28 --> 00:28:07.28
I mean, I swam.

643
00:28:07.28 --> 00:28:10.08
I don't know problem with swimming, but I wasn't a competitive swimmer.

644
00:28:10.08 --> 00:28:13.28
You were so much more prepared for bugs than me.

645
00:28:13.28 --> 00:28:18.20
I'm just like, even the fact that you analyzed like what your strengths and weaknesses were,

646
00:28:18.20 --> 00:28:22.68
I was just, I was just like, another way to go.

647
00:28:22.68 --> 00:28:23.68
Yeah.

648
00:28:23.68 --> 00:28:24.68
I worked out.

649
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:25.68
Yeah.

650
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:26.68
That was young too, which is beneficial.

651
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:29.28
You know, it's beneficial just to be young because you're just going to adapt.

652
00:28:29.28 --> 00:28:30.28
Right.

653
00:28:30.28 --> 00:28:31.88
I mean, your brain isn't even completely developed.

654
00:28:31.88 --> 00:28:32.88
Right.

655
00:28:32.88 --> 00:28:33.88
So you're what 24.

656
00:28:33.88 --> 00:28:34.88
More than like that.

657
00:28:34.88 --> 00:28:35.88
So I know 18, 19 years old.

658
00:28:35.88 --> 00:28:39.88
I was just full adaptation to whatever they're doing.

659
00:28:39.88 --> 00:28:41.88
And it's what you have to do in life in general.

660
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:45.48
But I distinctly remember going to the pool.

661
00:28:45.48 --> 00:28:47.84
So I'm reattimagled at this point.

662
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:49.32
And I'm going to the pool now.

663
00:28:49.32 --> 00:28:50.32
And it's outdoors.

664
00:28:50.32 --> 00:28:51.32
And it's frost.

665
00:28:51.32 --> 00:28:52.32
This is frost.

666
00:28:52.32 --> 00:28:53.32
Pretty buzz.

667
00:28:53.32 --> 00:28:54.32
Yeah.

668
00:28:54.32 --> 00:28:55.32
So there's like not snow, but that frost.

669
00:28:55.32 --> 00:28:56.32
Lair of frost on the pool decks.

670
00:28:56.32 --> 00:28:57.88
Once you got in, it was actually kind of warm.

671
00:28:57.88 --> 00:29:01.12
But you shoved the walk across that pool deck and jump in with these people that are way

672
00:29:01.12 --> 00:29:03.000
older, but way faster.

673
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.28
I was definitely the slowest person in this master's swim program with these people

674
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:09.28
and swim competitively and how they're 40 and which is old.

675
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:10.28
Yeah.

676
00:29:10.28 --> 00:29:11.28
And I'm 42 years old.

677
00:29:11.28 --> 00:29:12.64
There's those person who were receiving your life.

678
00:29:12.64 --> 00:29:15.44
And there's swim in it five in the morning.

679
00:29:15.44 --> 00:29:16.44
But so I did that.

680
00:29:16.44 --> 00:29:19.56
So I was prepared for the water.

681
00:29:19.56 --> 00:29:20.96
And I grew up in the water essentially.

682
00:29:20.96 --> 00:29:22.68
Scooplet and Scooplet having an age nine.

683
00:29:22.68 --> 00:29:23.96
It was comfortable in the water.

684
00:29:23.96 --> 00:29:24.96
We helped out.

685
00:29:24.96 --> 00:29:26.68
One to again, you are so much more prepared.

686
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:30.52
I was like, you know, well, I mean, I was, I could swim.

687
00:29:30.52 --> 00:29:32.32
And I surfed as a kid and that helped.

688
00:29:32.32 --> 00:29:33.88
But I definitely wasn't Scooplet diving.

689
00:29:33.88 --> 00:29:37.44
Yeah, I was diving for Abeloni up north.

690
00:29:37.44 --> 00:29:38.44
So that's been with all this kind of thing.

691
00:29:38.44 --> 00:29:39.44
I don't know if I do that now.

692
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:41.56
It's like a great, white, and breeding ground up there.

693
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:42.76
But Abeloni was amazing.

694
00:29:42.76 --> 00:29:45.64
I love that we camp out up there and just have a great time.

695
00:29:45.64 --> 00:29:48.72
But even though I prepared like that, the swims were hard.

696
00:29:48.72 --> 00:29:52.12
And that first swim, because it's that under water recovery stroke in 1996, they didn't

697
00:29:52.12 --> 00:29:53.12
teach you.

698
00:29:53.12 --> 00:29:54.32
Now they teach you how to do this thing.

699
00:29:54.32 --> 00:29:55.80
Now they get in the water.

700
00:29:55.80 --> 00:29:56.80
Here's your little basics.

701
00:29:56.80 --> 00:29:57.80
Here's how you do it.

702
00:29:57.80 --> 00:29:58.80
Bring your head up.

703
00:29:58.80 --> 00:29:59.80
Whatever.

704
00:29:59.80 --> 00:30:00.80
Focus.

705
00:30:00.80 --> 00:30:01.80
This.

706
00:30:01.80 --> 00:30:01.80
Now the book is talked about this.

707
00:30:01.80 --> 00:30:02.80
Let me try to do it.

708
00:30:02.80 --> 00:30:03.80
We can get this.

709
00:30:03.80 --> 00:30:06.60
And it was not in the master swim program.

710
00:30:06.60 --> 00:30:08.000
And I was third to last.

711
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I remember getting out of that first swim where they pair everybody up and whatever they

712
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.96
call it, the two weeks before you class up, whatever that thing is called.

713
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:16.40
And I was like, man, third to land.

714
00:30:16.40 --> 00:30:17.80
I can stagger out of the water.

715
00:30:17.80 --> 00:30:19.80
Like I put out onto this thing.

716
00:30:19.80 --> 00:30:24.72
And I'm like, wow, what's, and I went, they put everything up with this really slow guy.

717
00:30:24.72 --> 00:30:25.72
And I think he quit right away.

718
00:30:25.72 --> 00:30:28.48
So then they pair and put it up with somebody else who was faster.

719
00:30:28.48 --> 00:30:32.000
So I'm barely making the swims in first phase.

720
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.52
And then one of the guys in my class was a water polo player from USC or something like

721
00:30:36.52 --> 00:30:37.52
that.

722
00:30:37.52 --> 00:30:40.52
And he's like, hey, what we have to teach you how to do this stroke.

723
00:30:40.52 --> 00:30:41.52
But yeah, it'd be great.

724
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:45.52
And so we went out behind the barracks thing and went out in the in the ocean.

725
00:30:45.52 --> 00:30:46.80
And he just showed me how to do it.

726
00:30:46.80 --> 00:30:49.32
And I went from being third to last to the next swim.

727
00:30:49.32 --> 00:30:50.32
I was third.

728
00:30:50.32 --> 00:30:51.32
There you go.

729
00:30:51.32 --> 00:30:52.32
That was awesome.

730
00:30:52.32 --> 00:30:53.32
And I was never third again.

731
00:30:53.32 --> 00:30:54.32
I was like fifth or sixth.

732
00:30:54.32 --> 00:30:57.16
But when we go in third to last, I distinctly remember to then come out third after

733
00:30:57.16 --> 00:30:58.16
learning the stroke.

734
00:30:58.16 --> 00:30:59.16
So I got this.

735
00:30:59.16 --> 00:31:01.40
It's different to swim with fins too.

736
00:31:01.40 --> 00:31:04.20
And the way they teach you to do it is a little bit different.

737
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:05.20
Whatever.

738
00:31:05.20 --> 00:31:06.20
But now they prepare.

739
00:31:06.20 --> 00:31:07.20
Now you're preparing.

740
00:31:07.20 --> 00:31:08.20
You're going in physically.

741
00:31:08.20 --> 00:31:10.80
That eight weeks they spend in Chicago.

742
00:31:10.80 --> 00:31:11.80
They learn the strokes.

743
00:31:11.80 --> 00:31:16.000
They learn how to lift the logs and not hurt themselves and how to use the boat.

744
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.80
There's instructions on how to lift the logs.

745
00:31:17.80 --> 00:31:18.80
Pretty sure.

746
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:19.80
Oh, wow.

747
00:31:19.80 --> 00:31:20.80
How to climb the ropes.

748
00:31:20.80 --> 00:31:22.40
Mental toughness classes.

749
00:31:22.40 --> 00:31:23.40
All that stuff.

750
00:31:23.40 --> 00:31:24.40
Because they went.

751
00:31:24.40 --> 00:31:25.40
But you know what happened?

752
00:31:25.40 --> 00:31:26.40
Of course.

753
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:29.28
They were expecting a lot more shields to come through now because they needed more in

754
00:31:29.28 --> 00:31:31.16
2003, five, four, five, six.

755
00:31:31.16 --> 00:31:32.16
We need more seals.

756
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:33.64
So let's do this program.

757
00:31:33.64 --> 00:31:35.96
And now we just got the Fitter Quitters.

758
00:31:35.96 --> 00:31:36.96
So same essentially.

759
00:31:36.96 --> 00:31:37.96
Yeah, that's the crazy thing.

760
00:31:37.96 --> 00:31:38.96
Yeah.

761
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:40.20
The crazy thing is the attrition rate doesn't change.

762
00:31:40.20 --> 00:31:41.20
Exactly.

763
00:31:41.20 --> 00:31:42.20
Fitter Quitters.

764
00:31:42.20 --> 00:31:43.20
Fitter Quitters.

765
00:31:43.20 --> 00:31:44.20
I like that.

766
00:31:44.20 --> 00:31:45.88
Because it doesn't matter how many poles you can do.

767
00:31:45.88 --> 00:31:48.000
I mean, it does matter.

768
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.60
And people say mental or physical.

769
00:31:49.60 --> 00:31:50.60
It's definitely both.

770
00:31:50.60 --> 00:31:52.84
If you can't climb a rope, you're not making it through.

771
00:31:52.84 --> 00:31:54.04
It does matter how bad you go.

772
00:31:54.04 --> 00:31:55.04
I love it.

773
00:31:55.04 --> 00:31:57.64
If you've been put in the work, you're not going to be able to climb a rope.

774
00:31:57.64 --> 00:31:59.80
But yeah, you can get some Fitter Quitters.

775
00:31:59.80 --> 00:32:00.80
Exactly.

776
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:01.80
Exactly.

777
00:32:01.80 --> 00:32:04.80
Any average high school athlete physically can make it through.

778
00:32:04.80 --> 00:32:05.80
Totally agree.

779
00:32:05.80 --> 00:32:08.40
It's the obviously the mental part there that comes in.

780
00:32:08.40 --> 00:32:10.40
And you get guys that are an amazing shape.

781
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:13.16
Guys that were Olympic athletes or whatever it is.

782
00:32:13.16 --> 00:32:14.16
They quit right away.

783
00:32:14.16 --> 00:32:15.16
And I think a lot of that.

784
00:32:15.16 --> 00:32:20.96
Like the guy that killed himself maybe maybe hadn't faced adversity in the ways that

785
00:32:20.96 --> 00:32:24.32
you need to figure out how to actually overcome it and how to get knocked down and get

786
00:32:24.32 --> 00:32:26.20
moving forward.

787
00:32:26.20 --> 00:32:27.80
And you're going to get hurt.

788
00:32:27.80 --> 00:32:29.08
You're going to play hurt.

789
00:32:29.08 --> 00:32:30.80
And a lot of these guys are used to that.

790
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:32.84
They're used to being treated in a way.

791
00:32:32.84 --> 00:32:34.84
If they're hurt, they have someone's right there.

792
00:32:34.84 --> 00:32:35.84
Yeah.

793
00:32:35.84 --> 00:32:36.84
They're making sure that they're okay.

794
00:32:36.84 --> 00:32:38.88
And they're going to rehab and all that stuff.

795
00:32:38.88 --> 00:32:40.52
It's not like Lamborghini's.

796
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:42.56
They're going to the shop a lot.

797
00:32:42.56 --> 00:32:45.64
There's no one that really crushes bugs.

798
00:32:45.64 --> 00:32:48.20
I don't think that's just like, oh, yeah, everything was easy.

799
00:32:48.20 --> 00:32:49.64
Because there would be some really good athletes.

800
00:32:49.64 --> 00:32:54.04
And I did have some stud athletes in my honor man was a guy named Keith Camira who

801
00:32:54.04 --> 00:32:56.20
was just a beast.

802
00:32:56.20 --> 00:32:59.36
He just fast at everything and strong.

803
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:00.36
He was just a beast.

804
00:33:00.36 --> 00:33:03.88
And so I would say, I guess there are a few guys that crush bugs.

805
00:33:03.88 --> 00:33:07.88
But most people, they're going to have some, they're going to pick apart some weak points

806
00:33:07.88 --> 00:33:08.88
in you.

807
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:09.88
Yep.

808
00:33:09.88 --> 00:33:10.88
And that's what you want.

809
00:33:10.88 --> 00:33:11.88
I want to be tested.

810
00:33:11.88 --> 00:33:12.88
That was the whole, that was one of the main draws.

811
00:33:12.88 --> 00:33:14.92
Did you make it through first time every time?

812
00:33:14.92 --> 00:33:17.96
No, so I had after hell week, my fist lays weren't working.

813
00:33:17.96 --> 00:33:20.72
Whatever stress fractures, whatever it was.

814
00:33:20.72 --> 00:33:24.000
So they yanked me off the next swim because I was just, I don't know, sinking probably.

815
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And said, you're going to medical.

816
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I'm pushing.

817
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
No, I'm not going to medical.

818
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
It's like a clean.

819
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
It's like a clean.

820
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
It's like a clean.

821
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
It was not a clean.

822
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Exactly.

823
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I mean, they remember them pulling me out on the boat.

824
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
They're going to medical now.

825
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I was like, dang it.

826
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
So I went in there.

827
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
But it worked for me.

828
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Whatever they did.

829
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Like some people stood there at that time.

830
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.92
Like you could have a guy there for like a year, just kind of hiding out.

831
00:33:43.92 --> 00:33:44.92
But for me, it worked.

832
00:33:44.92 --> 00:33:46.92
It just makes me a little rest.

833
00:33:46.92 --> 00:33:47.92
And then, fast up with the next class.

834
00:33:47.92 --> 00:33:48.92
The next class.

835
00:33:48.92 --> 00:33:49.92
Yeah.

836
00:33:49.92 --> 00:33:53.12
What was your attitude when you got rolled?

837
00:33:53.12 --> 00:33:54.36
Was it like the end of your life?

838
00:33:54.36 --> 00:33:55.36
Free like, oh my god.

839
00:33:55.36 --> 00:33:56.36
Or are you like, okay, cool.

840
00:33:56.36 --> 00:33:59.04
I mean, because I guess there's so many people get rolled back.

841
00:33:59.04 --> 00:34:00.04
Yeah.

842
00:34:00.04 --> 00:34:01.04
Yeah.

843
00:34:01.04 --> 00:34:03.04
I was a little bummed because I was friends with all these guys.

844
00:34:03.04 --> 00:34:06.32
They were going on a dive phase and you're like, you're watching them, going to

845
00:34:06.32 --> 00:34:07.32
dive phase.

846
00:34:07.32 --> 00:34:09.68
And you're like, but then a lot of them get rolled back for pull-com.

847
00:34:09.68 --> 00:34:11.68
And then you got half your class back again.

848
00:34:11.68 --> 00:34:12.68
So that was great.

849
00:34:12.68 --> 00:34:14.84
And pull-com was my favorite.

850
00:34:14.84 --> 00:34:15.84
Like that.

851
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:19.88
And drown proofing because that's the only time you get to get physical with an instructor.

852
00:34:19.88 --> 00:34:22.000
The other time, like you're just there, you're getting yelled at.

853
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.40
You're being told your word was whatever.

854
00:34:24.40 --> 00:34:26.04
But this is the time where it's mono-emono.

855
00:34:26.04 --> 00:34:28.12
It's like you against them.

856
00:34:28.12 --> 00:34:29.92
And you know, it's a little bit physical.

857
00:34:29.92 --> 00:34:30.92
So I love pull-com.

858
00:34:30.92 --> 00:34:33.32
Past first time, I was comfortable in the water.

859
00:34:33.32 --> 00:34:35.64
But then the drown proofing also, that's what you really get in physical.

860
00:34:35.64 --> 00:34:38.32
They have the different types of bodies that you have to say.

861
00:34:38.32 --> 00:34:39.32
You mean life-saving.

862
00:34:39.32 --> 00:34:40.32
Life-saving.

863
00:34:40.32 --> 00:34:41.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:34:41.32 --> 00:34:42.32
That's true.

865
00:34:42.32 --> 00:34:43.32
So they have the guy to get on there.

866
00:34:43.32 --> 00:34:44.32
You know, just like dead weight.

867
00:34:44.32 --> 00:34:45.76
And then they went, that's fighting you.

868
00:34:45.76 --> 00:34:46.76
And that's the one I liked.

869
00:34:46.76 --> 00:34:47.76
That was awesome.

870
00:34:47.76 --> 00:34:48.76
And they dragged you to the bottom.

871
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:50.92
And I just feel like, and this is probably the martial arts stuff.

872
00:34:50.92 --> 00:34:52.56
It's just relax, because he's working.

873
00:34:52.56 --> 00:34:54.64
He's working to keep me down there at the bottom.

874
00:34:54.64 --> 00:34:56.96
And then when he comes up for air, then I just go a little more.

875
00:34:56.96 --> 00:34:59.32
And then he'd get his air, and he dragged me back down.

876
00:34:59.32 --> 00:35:00.64
But it was like us together.

877
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:02.20
Like, I love that part.

878
00:35:02.20 --> 00:35:03.20
That's my favorite part of my life.

879
00:35:03.20 --> 00:35:04.72
No one I figured out.

880
00:35:04.72 --> 00:35:07.84
I figured out what the choke-hold, right?

881
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:09.68
I figured out, like, okay, this is a choke.

882
00:35:09.68 --> 00:35:11.44
Like a rear-naked choke that I can use.

883
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:15.36
And the recovery is you, I think you put your arm over.

884
00:35:15.36 --> 00:35:18.24
Like, almost the same, but you grab them, like, by the lat on the other side.

885
00:35:18.24 --> 00:35:20.88
And I just realized, oh, if I just put it on over here, it's going to choke.

886
00:35:20.88 --> 00:35:23.76
This dude is going to make him get under control.

887
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:25.12
And then, but I can go back to the position.

888
00:35:25.12 --> 00:35:26.40
But yeah, I had a good time with that.

889
00:35:26.40 --> 00:35:39.20
I failed pull-com because the former UDT guy from NOM who ended up working for me at Trade-at.

890
00:35:39.20 --> 00:35:43.04
And one day I asked him, I said, you remember failing me in pull-com?

891
00:35:43.04 --> 00:35:44.04
Because, oh, yeah.

892
00:35:44.04 --> 00:35:45.52
I was just messing with you.

893
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:46.52
I was like, oh, cool.

894
00:35:46.52 --> 00:35:47.52
Thanks.

895
00:35:47.52 --> 00:35:48.52
Yeah, that's awesome.

896
00:35:48.52 --> 00:35:49.52
Appreciate it.

897
00:35:49.52 --> 00:35:50.52
And then I passed the next time.

898
00:35:50.52 --> 00:35:51.52
But yeah.

899
00:35:51.52 --> 00:35:52.52
Yeah.

900
00:35:52.52 --> 00:35:55.60
Those water I was pretty comfortable in from surfing growing up.

901
00:35:55.60 --> 00:35:58.60
But for me, everything, I had to work hard.

902
00:35:58.60 --> 00:36:00.000
I had to run hard all that stuff.

903
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Oh, yeah.

904
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
That's the whole thing.

905
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
That's what it's all about.

906
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.56
So you get done with Buds and where'd you get it going?

907
00:36:05.56 --> 00:36:06.96
Going team five.

908
00:36:06.96 --> 00:36:09.40
And back then, you're like, oh, it's going to happen.

909
00:36:09.40 --> 00:36:11.04
Oh, North Korea is going to happen.

910
00:36:11.04 --> 00:36:12.04
Yeah.

911
00:36:12.04 --> 00:36:13.52
So I've got to give you a reading stuff in the earth.

912
00:36:13.52 --> 00:36:15.76
And still going to happen through the news.

913
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:19.64
So I went to team five, that was my first choice.

914
00:36:19.64 --> 00:36:21.16
And it's just because of that.

915
00:36:21.16 --> 00:36:23.48
So now it's 1997.

916
00:36:23.48 --> 00:36:24.48
Yeah.

917
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:25.48
Yeah.

918
00:36:25.48 --> 00:36:26.48
Yeah.

919
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:29.48
So I was still on the west coast at this time.

920
00:36:29.48 --> 00:36:30.68
I was over at Team One.

921
00:36:30.68 --> 00:36:31.68
Yep.

922
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:32.68
And I was I was in training.

923
00:36:32.68 --> 00:36:36.52
So probably got that was right around when I got picked up for a commissioning program.

924
00:36:36.52 --> 00:36:39.24
So I'm just trying to think time frame like all the guys that I know from Team

925
00:36:39.24 --> 00:36:40.24
Five were all there.

926
00:36:40.24 --> 00:36:41.24
Yeah.

927
00:36:41.24 --> 00:36:42.24
Well, it's cool 90s.

928
00:36:42.24 --> 00:36:43.24
Welcome in you aboard.

929
00:36:43.24 --> 00:36:44.24
Oh, yeah.

930
00:36:44.24 --> 00:36:45.24
Very great.

931
00:36:45.24 --> 00:36:46.24
Very gentle.

932
00:36:46.24 --> 00:36:47.24
Love it.

933
00:36:47.24 --> 00:36:48.24
And I loved it.

934
00:36:48.24 --> 00:36:50.56
We'd get there, of course, and get issued a pager.

935
00:36:50.56 --> 00:36:52.60
And then they'd give us all this awesome gear.

936
00:36:52.60 --> 00:36:54.36
And we'd be at the bar drinking.

937
00:36:54.36 --> 00:36:55.84
And I'll send that go off in the movies.

938
00:36:55.84 --> 00:36:56.60
And we'd fly off.

939
00:36:56.60 --> 00:37:00.04
And save the princess and get back in time for a beer's the next night.

940
00:37:00.04 --> 00:37:01.04
Yeah.

941
00:37:01.04 --> 00:37:04.64
And then I get there and it's like, hey, you guys clean that toilet.

942
00:37:04.64 --> 00:37:05.64
And paint that wall.

943
00:37:05.64 --> 00:37:07.04
Change those light bulbs.

944
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:08.84
And I was like, Roger that.

945
00:37:08.84 --> 00:37:09.84
Let's do it.

946
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:11.24
I'm going to be the best light bulb we've changed.

947
00:37:11.24 --> 00:37:13.44
And that you've got here.

948
00:37:13.44 --> 00:37:14.84
So that was a little different.

949
00:37:14.84 --> 00:37:15.84
Little.

950
00:37:15.84 --> 00:37:17.44
Did you go through SQT at Group One?

951
00:37:17.44 --> 00:37:18.44
Did you go through it?

952
00:37:18.44 --> 00:37:19.44
Second time.

953
00:37:19.44 --> 00:37:21.44
Yeah, it was the second class at Group One.

954
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:22.44
OK.

955
00:37:22.44 --> 00:37:24.24
And yeah, so went through that one.

956
00:37:24.24 --> 00:37:25.24
And it was good.

957
00:37:25.24 --> 00:37:27.000
It was professionalizing it, standardizing things.

958
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.28
Obviously it's more professional now.

959
00:37:29.28 --> 00:37:30.64
But yeah, it was great time.

960
00:37:30.64 --> 00:37:31.64
Love that.

961
00:37:31.64 --> 00:37:32.64
Had a blast.

962
00:37:32.64 --> 00:37:35.44
And as you rolled into, if there was your position in your first turn, what

963
00:37:35.44 --> 00:37:36.44
do you do?

964
00:37:36.44 --> 00:37:39.24
I was the assistant calm guy.

965
00:37:39.24 --> 00:37:42.64
So for whatever reason they're like, college, you're going to calm school.

966
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:43.64
Oh, yeah.

967
00:37:43.64 --> 00:37:44.64
I want to be the point man.

968
00:37:44.64 --> 00:37:45.64
Exactly.

969
00:37:45.64 --> 00:37:46.64
You must be smart.

970
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:47.64
I want to be a point man.

971
00:37:47.64 --> 00:37:48.64
Yeah, of course.

972
00:37:48.64 --> 00:37:49.64
Yeah, read those books.

973
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:50.64
Right point man.

974
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:51.64
Of course.

975
00:37:51.64 --> 00:37:52.64
What patches Watson.

976
00:37:52.64 --> 00:37:53.64
And that's what you want to do.

977
00:37:53.64 --> 00:37:54.64
Washington, all those movies.

978
00:37:54.64 --> 00:37:55.64
So when they told me how to be at calm guys, like, dang it.

979
00:37:55.64 --> 00:37:58.44
You know, that's the guy that, well, wanted to get shot first and all the Vietnamese

980
00:37:58.44 --> 00:37:59.44
right next to the old Asian McKinney.

981
00:37:59.44 --> 00:38:00.44
He's got the thing.

982
00:38:00.44 --> 00:38:01.44
Yeah, yeah.

983
00:38:01.44 --> 00:38:02.44
Yeah, yeah.

984
00:38:02.44 --> 00:38:04.44
They had 10 that sticking up in the jungle and over the grass.

985
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:05.44
And that's what they.

986
00:38:05.44 --> 00:38:06.44
So anyway, but I did that.

987
00:38:06.44 --> 00:38:09.24
It was actually a great experience being a calm guy because you're part of the planning

988
00:38:09.24 --> 00:38:10.24
process.

989
00:38:10.24 --> 00:38:12.24
And then you're learning the radio.

990
00:38:12.24 --> 00:38:13.24
Yeah, it was great.

991
00:38:13.24 --> 00:38:17.96
So it's going through that calm course and then bringing back the newest, when I really

992
00:38:17.96 --> 00:38:20.72
was radio, it was techniques, whatever it is, to the pool tune.

993
00:38:20.72 --> 00:38:25.12
So even though you have a primary calm guy, you kind of know what's going on after that.

994
00:38:25.12 --> 00:38:26.12
That's a good course.

995
00:38:26.12 --> 00:38:27.12
There wasn't any way.

996
00:38:27.12 --> 00:38:28.12
It was a long course.

997
00:38:28.12 --> 00:38:30.000
So it's good to be part of the planning process.

998
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.84
So as for someone that was going to be an officer at some point, I got to experience

999
00:38:33.84 --> 00:38:34.84
the plan.

1000
00:38:34.84 --> 00:38:35.84
Did you even have that in your brain?

1001
00:38:35.84 --> 00:38:36.84
I knew it was an option.

1002
00:38:36.84 --> 00:38:37.84
It was an option.

1003
00:38:37.84 --> 00:38:40.48
So it was either that or the other East Coast seal team.

1004
00:38:40.48 --> 00:38:41.48
Yeah.

1005
00:38:41.48 --> 00:38:43.20
And I wanted to do both of those.

1006
00:38:43.20 --> 00:38:47.12
I thought, but I figured out, let's give this a, let's check it out.

1007
00:38:47.12 --> 00:38:51.84
I'm brand new, figure this out and see if I'm going to be an officer one day or go to another

1008
00:38:51.84 --> 00:38:55.64
seal team or move on and go to the central intelligence agency like all the people

1009
00:38:55.64 --> 00:38:59.16
that read about and then watch the movies.

1010
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:00.16
So and there's nothing going on.

1011
00:39:00.16 --> 00:39:01.16
Right?

1012
00:39:01.16 --> 00:39:02.16
There's nothing going on.

1013
00:39:02.16 --> 00:39:03.16
Yeah, it's nice.

1014
00:39:03.16 --> 00:39:04.16
Yeah, exactly.

1015
00:39:04.16 --> 00:39:05.16
And nothing happened.

1016
00:39:05.16 --> 00:39:08.20
And some ship boarding, like one put to into a ship boarding.

1017
00:39:08.20 --> 00:39:09.20
Was it your put to?

1018
00:39:09.20 --> 00:39:10.20
No.

1019
00:39:10.20 --> 00:39:11.20
No.

1020
00:39:11.20 --> 00:39:12.20
Because I did.

1021
00:39:12.20 --> 00:39:13.20
I did a rat for September 11.

1022
00:39:13.20 --> 00:39:14.20
This is before that.

1023
00:39:14.20 --> 00:39:15.20
Yeah.

1024
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:16.20
Yeah.

1025
00:39:16.20 --> 00:39:17.20
Yeah.

1026
00:39:17.20 --> 00:39:18.20
Yeah.

1027
00:39:18.20 --> 00:39:19.20
September 11th.

1028
00:39:19.20 --> 00:39:20.20
Doing ship boarding.

1029
00:39:20.20 --> 00:39:23.20
It's like, you know, I was walking around like I was damn him.

1030
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:28.20
You know, the like, whoever I was walking from like I was, you know, all the

1031
00:39:28.20 --> 00:39:29.20
things.

1032
00:39:29.20 --> 00:39:30.20
Yeah.

1033
00:39:30.20 --> 00:39:33.20
So we had big combat experience like no, you're a loser.

1034
00:39:33.20 --> 00:39:35.20
But back then, that's what you wanted to be doing.

1035
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:36.20
No.

1036
00:39:36.20 --> 00:39:37.20
And to be quite frank, we weren't walking around.

1037
00:39:37.20 --> 00:39:40.40
But we were, I've been out completely stoked that we got to do something real.

1038
00:39:40.40 --> 00:39:41.80
But I got to lock in the load by gun.

1039
00:39:41.80 --> 00:39:42.80
That was cool.

1040
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:43.80
And it was good.

1041
00:39:43.80 --> 00:39:45.80
It was, you know, good enough.

1042
00:39:45.80 --> 00:39:47.80
Because most guys didn't get do that.

1043
00:39:47.80 --> 00:39:50.28
Most time you know, many guys were just going to implement.

1044
00:39:50.28 --> 00:39:54.68
And they would train other, you know, foreign militaries on how to do stuff.

1045
00:39:54.68 --> 00:39:57.12
And that's cool build relationships with other countries.

1046
00:39:57.12 --> 00:39:58.12
Cool.

1047
00:39:58.12 --> 00:39:59.12
All that do some big exercises.

1048
00:39:59.12 --> 00:40:00.12
Cool.

1049
00:40:00.12 --> 00:40:04.40
But to actually lock in the load you're weapon and get you have a real load out was pretty

1050
00:40:04.40 --> 00:40:07.68
was like a big step back down.

1051
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:10.24
And it felt great for me.

1052
00:40:10.24 --> 00:40:12.44
But this was, so this is 97.

1053
00:40:12.44 --> 00:40:13.92
And where'd you go on the planet?

1054
00:40:13.92 --> 00:40:14.92
So that was a fake om.

1055
00:40:14.92 --> 00:40:17.56
So is it just, was it ship order?

1056
00:40:17.56 --> 00:40:18.56
No, no, no, no.

1057
00:40:18.56 --> 00:40:20.56
It was all the things you just talked about.

1058
00:40:20.56 --> 00:40:22.56
Yeah, so you just train in South Korea.

1059
00:40:22.56 --> 00:40:25.24
Different countries, travel, Australia, wherever else.

1060
00:40:25.24 --> 00:40:27.64
So just then the normal paycom type thing.

1061
00:40:27.64 --> 00:40:30.24
Well, pre September 11th with much going on.

1062
00:40:30.24 --> 00:40:32.48
And then you come back from that deployment role right into another.

1063
00:40:32.48 --> 00:40:33.72
Because that's what you guys do.

1064
00:40:33.72 --> 00:40:35.04
They become one cruise wonder.

1065
00:40:35.04 --> 00:40:36.84
You get promoted to one cruise wonder.

1066
00:40:36.84 --> 00:40:37.84
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:40:37.84 --> 00:40:38.84
Where are you the primary comms guy?

1068
00:40:38.84 --> 00:40:39.84
Did you skate out of comms?

1069
00:40:39.84 --> 00:40:41.88
Oh, no, how did you get any good schools in between?

1070
00:40:41.88 --> 00:40:42.68
Yeah, which you get?

1071
00:40:42.68 --> 00:40:43.68
Free fall sniper.

1072
00:40:43.68 --> 00:40:44.68
Oh, yeah.

1073
00:40:44.68 --> 00:40:46.16
Yeah, so trouble trouble.

1074
00:40:46.16 --> 00:40:47.56
Yeah, so sniper is what I want.

1075
00:40:47.56 --> 00:40:48.72
So you must have been squared away.

1076
00:40:48.72 --> 00:40:50.20
Because they don't just give those schools away.

1077
00:40:50.20 --> 00:40:51.20
I mean, I don't know.

1078
00:40:51.20 --> 00:40:51.92
Yeah, it's my chief.

1079
00:40:51.92 --> 00:40:53.64
But yeah, I did.

1080
00:40:53.64 --> 00:40:55.64
I checked with them.

1081
00:40:55.64 --> 00:40:57.12
He was a crazy man, that guy.

1082
00:40:57.12 --> 00:41:00.24
But yeah, so right to sniper school, which is what I wanted.

1083
00:41:00.24 --> 00:41:01.16
Which I always wanted to do.

1084
00:41:01.16 --> 00:41:02.52
So got there.

1085
00:41:02.52 --> 00:41:04.28
Did 73 days, I guess.

1086
00:41:04.28 --> 00:41:07.40
And what, Collingo, or you get the Valley fever.

1087
00:41:07.40 --> 00:41:08.72
And stuff going on.

1088
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:10.40
So I passed.

1089
00:41:10.40 --> 00:41:11.92
So I passed, but I didn't pass stocking.

1090
00:41:11.92 --> 00:41:14.32
Or because I didn't grow up doing that sort of thing.

1091
00:41:14.32 --> 00:41:15.92
So I was shooting.

1092
00:41:15.92 --> 00:41:16.88
You know, that was good.

1093
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:18.56
I grew up shooting.

1094
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:20.96
So I didn't know problems there.

1095
00:41:20.96 --> 00:41:22.96
Then the stocking was a shock to me.

1096
00:41:22.96 --> 00:41:24.72
I didn't really understand what was going on.

1097
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:25.72
I was crawling.

1098
00:41:25.72 --> 00:41:26.72
People.

1099
00:41:26.72 --> 00:41:27.96
I was crawling for 1,000 visitors.

1100
00:41:27.96 --> 00:41:28.96
You know, out to do this.

1101
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:30.52
And you can just walk for most of that.

1102
00:41:30.52 --> 00:41:31.76
You know, I didn't know that at the time.

1103
00:41:31.76 --> 00:41:32.96
You know, those are what they didn't know.

1104
00:41:32.96 --> 00:41:33.96
We were doing.

1105
00:41:33.96 --> 00:41:36.48
We were just crawling in Nyland in the summer.

1106
00:41:36.48 --> 00:41:37.48
Yeah.

1107
00:41:37.48 --> 00:41:38.48
And then they did it again.

1108
00:41:38.48 --> 00:41:39.48
And then knocked it out.

1109
00:41:39.48 --> 00:41:42.24
Yeah, we just said Jason Gardner on the same thing.

1110
00:41:42.24 --> 00:41:45.48
You know, he, he said, yeah, I'm a shot fine.

1111
00:41:45.48 --> 00:41:46.88
But failed stocking.

1112
00:41:46.88 --> 00:41:47.88
Hell no kidding.

1113
00:41:47.88 --> 00:41:50.68
And then he came back on again and was talking about, well, he talked about some

1114
00:41:50.68 --> 00:41:51.68
of the mistakes he made.

1115
00:41:51.68 --> 00:41:53.24
And it was very similar to what you said.

1116
00:41:53.24 --> 00:41:57.80
But they would tell him like, hey, figure out where you're trying to get to and actually

1117
00:41:57.80 --> 00:41:59.80
analyze the situation before you start moving.

1118
00:41:59.80 --> 00:42:03.24
And of course, when he was younger, he was just, oh, I'm just going to go.

1119
00:42:03.24 --> 00:42:04.24
Yeah.

1120
00:42:04.24 --> 00:42:05.24
And so he went.

1121
00:42:05.24 --> 00:42:06.44
And he would make it in time where people would see him.

1122
00:42:06.44 --> 00:42:08.32
So yeah, that stocking thing is no joke.

1123
00:42:08.32 --> 00:42:10.16
But the second time was complete.

1124
00:42:10.16 --> 00:42:11.16
I think I just relaxed.

1125
00:42:11.16 --> 00:42:17.20
Did you go, did you go through it the second time when you go back for stocking?

1126
00:42:17.20 --> 00:42:18.20
Right.

1127
00:42:18.20 --> 00:42:20.000
Before I think we deployed, yeah, right before we deployed.

1128
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Yeah, right before we deployed.

1129
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
But they're in that same work.

1130
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Yeah.

1131
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Okay.

1132
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
That's cool.

1133
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
That's awesome.

1134
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Yeah.

1135
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
So right back.

1136
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
But yeah, I think I just relaxed.

1137
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And I got there knocked them all out.

1138
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Oh, you have points for people who don't know.

1139
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Yeah.

1140
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.000
We build up points as you stock or whatever.

1141
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.36
So the last, I think, couple stocks.

1142
00:42:33.36 --> 00:42:34.36
I'd already had on my points.

1143
00:42:34.36 --> 00:42:36.36
So I'm trying to help other guys.

1144
00:42:36.36 --> 00:42:37.36
Cool.

1145
00:42:37.36 --> 00:42:38.36
You know, I've looking back.

1146
00:42:38.36 --> 00:42:39.92
I'm like, should I really help these people?

1147
00:42:39.92 --> 00:42:40.92
Oh, sure.

1148
00:42:40.92 --> 00:42:41.92
They have, you know, should I've gone back to my field?

1149
00:42:41.92 --> 00:42:42.92
My buds thing.

1150
00:42:42.92 --> 00:42:44.92
Like, but you're different.

1151
00:42:44.92 --> 00:42:49.88
What's different to help them, like, by trying to distract the instructors or by finding

1152
00:42:49.88 --> 00:42:53.76
that that OP, you have to crawl in with an a certain distance.

1153
00:42:53.76 --> 00:42:54.76
Yeah.

1154
00:42:54.76 --> 00:42:57.64
And then let them know, hey, you know, you're too far, you're too close.

1155
00:42:57.64 --> 00:42:58.64
Risking.

1156
00:42:58.64 --> 00:42:59.64
Yeah.

1157
00:42:59.64 --> 00:43:00.64
Like, there it is.

1158
00:43:00.64 --> 00:43:01.64
So he didn't have to risk it.

1159
00:43:01.64 --> 00:43:02.64
Oh, I did.

1160
00:43:02.64 --> 00:43:03.64
That sort of thing.

1161
00:43:03.64 --> 00:43:04.64
So should I have done that?

1162
00:43:04.64 --> 00:43:05.64
Maybe not.

1163
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:09.52
But anyway, but it gave me good practice too, because I got to push the limits then,

1164
00:43:09.52 --> 00:43:12.56
which gave me a lot of confidence in what I was going to do later.

1165
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:13.56
That's pretty awesome.

1166
00:43:13.56 --> 00:43:18.20
And then I paid for myself to go to some urban sniper, of course, at Pendleton.

1167
00:43:18.20 --> 00:43:23.24
Some, you know, one of these kind of fly by night operations that was going on back then

1168
00:43:23.24 --> 00:43:24.80
to teach people how to do whatever.

1169
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:27.52
So I went to an urban sniper course that I paid for because I was curious.

1170
00:43:27.52 --> 00:43:29.000
I didn't do that at the time.

1171
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
It was an average school.

1172
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.20
So I got to learn about urban hides and all that sort of thing, which was pretty cool.

1173
00:43:33.20 --> 00:43:34.20
Sweet, who's wrong?

1174
00:43:34.20 --> 00:43:35.20
I forget the name of it.

1175
00:43:35.20 --> 00:43:36.88
I think it had like, but like, who did that?

1176
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:39.24
Or were they former, I think former Marine snipers, I think.

1177
00:43:39.24 --> 00:43:41.24
That were how well-fused it, Pendleton, I guess, probably was.

1178
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:42.48
Some connections there or something.

1179
00:43:42.48 --> 00:43:43.48
Exactly.

1180
00:43:43.48 --> 00:43:44.48
Exactly.

1181
00:43:44.48 --> 00:43:51.000
So, and then freefall, too, and freefall, was a crazy one, because that was, I came back to the

1182
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.80
team one day and I didn't get freefall right away at it's sniper school.

1183
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:59.44
And then you should kind of like one of the other for a new guy coming back.

1184
00:43:59.44 --> 00:44:04.84
So my friends went and I came back from, and this was the first time that they'd done

1185
00:44:04.84 --> 00:44:08.56
the civilian deal with it, they were training.

1186
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:09.56
Oh, okay.

1187
00:44:09.56 --> 00:44:11.36
But to wherever that was.

1188
00:44:11.36 --> 00:44:13.80
So, came back from lunch, it was like your back, and you're kind of, you have

1189
00:44:13.80 --> 00:44:16.80
be able to go to schools, and it's, you know, so the people that they can leave or whatever

1190
00:44:16.80 --> 00:44:18.44
got married.

1191
00:44:18.44 --> 00:44:23.76
And so I came back and I see Andy Stomph, who you know, and he's got this look on his face.

1192
00:44:23.76 --> 00:44:25.48
And I'm like, oh, that's weird.

1193
00:44:25.48 --> 00:44:28.28
I parked my truck, and there's no gate guard at the time.

1194
00:44:28.28 --> 00:44:30.88
He's drive on the base, remember that?

1195
00:44:30.88 --> 00:44:34.72
And he told us, I don't know, our dear friends had burned in and died.

1196
00:44:34.72 --> 00:44:36.92
Three fall, like in that first week.

1197
00:44:36.92 --> 00:44:39.84
And then of course, what does the team do?

1198
00:44:39.84 --> 00:44:43.56
After I night, yeah, I go to the family, we're dear friends, and do the whole, all that stuff.

1199
00:44:43.56 --> 00:44:45.36
His first experience with that.

1200
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:48.96
And so as a team do, oh, you're going to free fall.

1201
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:49.96
Yeah.

1202
00:44:49.96 --> 00:44:53.96
Like a week later after the funeral, like, paying, okay, let's do it.

1203
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:57.88
So yeah, what did the UMA not the civilian one, but went to UMA, stopped at Bragg

1204
00:44:57.88 --> 00:45:01.48
first for the, for the air tunnel, if they, they did back then the wind tunnel.

1205
00:45:01.48 --> 00:45:02.48
Oh, that's cool.

1206
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:03.48
And then, uh, an on the UMA.

1207
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:06.60
So did those before my, uh, my second upal tune.

1208
00:45:06.60 --> 00:45:09.12
And then you go on your second, you go on your second deployment.

1209
00:45:09.12 --> 00:45:10.12
Yep.

1210
00:45:10.12 --> 00:45:11.28
Yeah, I went to do go on deployment.

1211
00:45:11.28 --> 00:45:12.88
So a couple of weeks before September 11th.

1212
00:45:12.88 --> 00:45:13.88
Oh, yep.

1213
00:45:13.88 --> 00:45:17.80
So, uh, Guam, expecting a, uh, I don't like the first one.

1214
00:45:17.80 --> 00:45:21.60
Just they were going to go train some people, finally get to go to Thailand.

1215
00:45:21.60 --> 00:45:24.000
And yeah, two weeks into it, September 11th happen.

1216
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.32
People start banging on doors up and down.

1217
00:45:26.32 --> 00:45:28.12
The barracks and we'd have TVs in our room.

1218
00:45:28.12 --> 00:45:32.36
Then, so, uh, you know, phones are ringing, because it's midnight, I guess, in Guam.

1219
00:45:32.36 --> 00:45:34.28
And, uh, you know, nine am on the east coast.

1220
00:45:34.28 --> 00:45:38.20
And we all get up and go down to the basement of the barracks in Guam where we had one

1221
00:45:38.20 --> 00:45:39.20
TV.

1222
00:45:39.20 --> 00:45:41.76
And we all watched the, the Twin Towers, fallen TV.

1223
00:45:41.76 --> 00:45:42.76
And I was the Intel guy too.

1224
00:45:42.76 --> 00:45:44.08
So I was comms and Intel.

1225
00:45:44.08 --> 00:45:45.08
Uh-huh.

1226
00:45:45.08 --> 00:45:48.44
And so I've been reading, I just, you know, read, uh, what have been Laden book was,

1227
00:45:48.44 --> 00:45:51.28
but that were previous year, the man who declared war in America.

1228
00:45:51.28 --> 00:45:52.60
I think it was cool.

1229
00:45:52.60 --> 00:45:54.000
And so I was doing, I was always reading this stuff.

1230
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I was always fascinated by it.

1231
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
I was always reading about terrorism, insurgencies, and we're going to make myself the best

1232
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.12
to see it like it possibly be.

1233
00:45:59.12 --> 00:46:00.60
So I knew it all kind of meant.

1234
00:46:00.60 --> 00:46:02.72
And I knew it meant the base.

1235
00:46:02.72 --> 00:46:04.28
And so I gave a brief right away.

1236
00:46:04.28 --> 00:46:09.24
And nobody knew the number of the seal of Guam at no idea who all kind of was.

1237
00:46:09.24 --> 00:46:13.68
And so I gave my brief and, you know, if he's up and studied it ever since.

1238
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:16.68
But, um, that was, we thought we'd be on plans the next day.

1239
00:46:16.68 --> 00:46:17.68
That's the song.

1240
00:46:17.68 --> 00:46:18.68
Let's go.

1241
00:46:18.68 --> 00:46:21.52
We start palatizing, getting ready, uh, but really took a couple weeks.

1242
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:22.52
And then, then off we went.

1243
00:46:22.52 --> 00:46:26.16
And that's when I did the ship boardings, um, because we took over a 14-3, who went into

1244
00:46:26.16 --> 00:46:30.52
Afghanistan and we ended up taking their ship boarding mission, which actually looking back,

1245
00:46:30.52 --> 00:46:33.64
was a good one because that's my only ship boarding experience.

1246
00:46:33.64 --> 00:46:37.44
And it was interesting because it's like a cop pulling over, pulling over someone in the

1247
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:38.44
middle of the night.

1248
00:46:38.44 --> 00:46:39.44
You don't know what you're walking up on.

1249
00:46:39.44 --> 00:46:40.44
You have no idea.

1250
00:46:40.44 --> 00:46:44.60
Instead of a car, when a cop, this is a, uh, a class three tanker that's heading for

1251
00:46:44.60 --> 00:46:47.56
Iranian waters and you have a certain amount of time to get on there, it turned it around.

1252
00:46:47.56 --> 00:46:49.16
And, you know, it was an E5.

1253
00:46:49.16 --> 00:46:53.80
I'm turning around to class three tankers using my GPS and a compass, you know, turning this

1254
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:54.80
thing around.

1255
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:55.80
It was so, it was pretty cool.

1256
00:46:55.80 --> 00:46:56.80
Do it.

1257
00:46:56.80 --> 00:47:00.08
And there's some good coordination that has to happen on those.

1258
00:47:00.08 --> 00:47:05.08
So it's as a calm guy, you're, you're working a bunch of different networks and, yeah,

1259
00:47:05.08 --> 00:47:07.80
then you're, you, did you end up, yeah, well, you just said it.

1260
00:47:07.80 --> 00:47:10.44
You end up a lot of times being the person that knows how to work GPS because you're

1261
00:47:10.44 --> 00:47:12.16
the calm guy, at least it used to be that way.

1262
00:47:12.16 --> 00:47:13.16
Now everybody has all they know.

1263
00:47:13.16 --> 00:47:15.04
Now everybody knows how to do it, put yeah.

1264
00:47:15.04 --> 00:47:18.60
Actually, the map and compass, that's why I went, I later on, jumping ahead, I had

1265
00:47:18.60 --> 00:47:19.60
to relearn map and compass.

1266
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:23.68
Like I had so dependent on GPS and there was a book, I think it's called, uh, be expert

1267
00:47:23.68 --> 00:47:24.68
with map and compass.

1268
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:28.92
So when I took over the junior officer training course, before I got out, um, we had a really

1269
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:32.000
good, uh, not course that we did.

1270
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And that's why we taught myself.

1271
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Yeah, that's why we taught myself.

1272
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.84
The map and compass, like so, so I was a calm guy.

1273
00:47:36.84 --> 00:47:41.64
And when we first started getting issued, this was in like 92, we first started getting

1274
00:47:41.64 --> 00:47:42.64
issued the big GPS.

1275
00:47:42.64 --> 00:47:45.84
So they were, they were like the size of a, and they were big.

1276
00:47:45.84 --> 00:47:47.44
They were like the size of two shoe boxes.

1277
00:47:47.44 --> 00:47:49.44
And remember, they were big.

1278
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:54.24
The PSN8 with this big giant antenna that was like the size of my water bottle.

1279
00:47:54.24 --> 00:47:58.24
But, but what was interesting is they say, okay, Jaco, you know, you gotta figure out how

1280
00:47:58.24 --> 00:47:59.24
to work this thing.

1281
00:47:59.24 --> 00:48:00.24
So I figured out how to work it.

1282
00:48:00.24 --> 00:48:03.76
And then I said, well, all it does is tells us where we are.

1283
00:48:03.76 --> 00:48:07.80
And they're like, yeah, and I said, if we have a map and compass, we're good.

1284
00:48:07.80 --> 00:48:10.36
Like I know where we are on a map and compass for sure.

1285
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:11.36
I'm like, I know.

1286
00:48:11.36 --> 00:48:12.36
I'll let see it's different.

1287
00:48:12.36 --> 00:48:14.16
You know, you want to get over the horizon.

1288
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:18.64
But anyway, so it was kind of always surprising to me that it's so much easier.

1289
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:23.76
If you do a good terrain study, you can just walk and you can look at your compass occasionally.

1290
00:48:23.76 --> 00:48:25.20
And you know where you are.

1291
00:48:25.20 --> 00:48:29.24
Rather than constantly looking at a GPS and getting your night vision trashed from that

1292
00:48:29.24 --> 00:48:32.24
or whatever, it just was a different transition.

1293
00:48:32.24 --> 00:48:37.56
I mean, and then obviously, GPS has became so good that, yeah, I mean, they're pretty awesome.

1294
00:48:37.56 --> 00:48:38.96
Everyone has long their watch.

1295
00:48:38.96 --> 00:48:39.96
Yeah, they're pretty awesome now.

1296
00:48:39.96 --> 00:48:43.96
But I did like the map and cup of stuff because I grew up doing it in the Sierra,

1297
00:48:43.96 --> 00:48:45.72
I grew up back back in and doing that.

1298
00:48:45.72 --> 00:48:49.000
But before I came after I called, I went to Alaska for three months and back back around

1299
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
up there to the National Latter Leadership School up there.

1300
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Once again, training.

1301
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Getting ready.

1302
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
You were so ready, fellas.

1303
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
I went to high school.

1304
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
That's what I did.

1305
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Yeah.

1306
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
But that just goes, it doesn't matter.

1307
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
You know, it's all the metal part, doesn't matter.

1308
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
How much you prepare, how little you prepare.

1309
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It's all if you want it.

1310
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
If you're average athlete and you want this thing, hey, just don't quit.

1311
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
You'll learn along the way.

1312
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
You'll get in better shape when you start running that sand.

1313
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Just don't quit.

1314
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
That's it.

1315
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
We'll get you a good running tip.

1316
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
So at what point did you put in for an officer package?

1317
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
So that's spring before the September 11th of the moment.

1318
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
It was we had a let's say a chief that was interesting.

1319
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Leadership team I'd say that was interesting.

1320
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
And you know, the E5 Mafia was not happy.

1321
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
They were, and it was, there's one of those things like, hey, I can complain about it.

1322
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Like everybody else, or I can put it in this package and go and do it better than it was done for me.

1323
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
So that's what I did.

1324
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
And you got picked up first time?

1325
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Oh, you already had a college degree in on that.

1326
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Yeah, so put in didn't put out my number there's I won't say who he is because I think he's an admiral now, but he was an exo at the time.

1327
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
And he went for my interview and there's a Friday afternoon.

1328
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
So Friday afternoon team five workout included a gig.

1329
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
And so, you know, I didn't, I did the workout, but then I changed into my whites.

1330
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
So now I mean my whites in the spring and those things are horrible.

1331
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I hate those uniforms, but so I mean my whites get in them all perfect.

1332
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
And I go in to do my interview with the exo at the time.

1333
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And I don't know now. And he's got a beer in front of him and his PT stuff.

1334
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:25.000
He's like, I just want you to know how this is going to go and if it's any indication that this beer should be an indication of how this interview is going to go.

1335
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
And I was like, I love it. I was still, you know, don't know.

1336
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Yeah, of course.

1337
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
So it's very very, you know, the whole thing.

1338
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
But yeah, of course, I did, I did at a good first couple of tunes as a new guy.

1339
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I would know what we're going on.

1340
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
And so I got picked up the first time.

1341
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And then you went to OCS.

1342
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Oh, yeah, after I got back.

1343
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
So, but of course, the temperal event happens and I'm like, dang it.

1344
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
I'm going to be around choice.

1345
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Because I, if what you want to be is you want to be an listed guy.

1346
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
You know, going to be in the fight for a while first anyway.

1347
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Yeah.

1348
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
So, but it ended up working out well because I got right back from that deployment.

1349
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Did, well, I did it a little training trip to a place and that was a great experience.

1350
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
And then, it's classed up for OCS at in Pensacola,

1351
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Pensacola and to the same things.

1352
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Yeah, I did that too.

1353
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
It's awful to do the same things we didn't book and have full of the underwear, full of t-shirts, making our bed.

1354
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
You know, all those things that somehow qualify you to lead me in combat.

1355
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000
And then right to the seal teams, right back to seal teams and ended up at a great team that's kind of right.

1356
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Well, so you know, I just come back from another East Coast seal team.

1357
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
He spent almost a year deployed after September 11th and brought his lessons learned back.

1358
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
And then he sent me to that team and right down range.

1359
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So, as a brand new officer, I was down range fairly quickly.

1360
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Timing wise, it worked out well for me.

1361
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
That's beautiful.

1362
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Yeah, I got learned at, learned a ton on that deployment and then brought that back to my team and then deployed again right right away to Iraq.

1363
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
So I got to get it.

1364
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Then you deployed as an assistant to the computer.

1365
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
I was like a third one, a third one.

1366
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
A third one.

1367
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
A third one.

1368
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Yep, third one.

1369
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So you ended up doing a lot of the admin stuff and I used to load a lot.

1370
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
But that's when, was an extra guy, essentially.

1371
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Yeah.

1372
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
That's when the job happened.

1373
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
So that's when I had probably the most, the most formative time in uniform was taking a sniper team into the job.

1374
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
So it's, you know, pitch combat for, he was a two-week campaign.

1375
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000
So it was 11 days and it was one of the first times I think that that we really went to the conventional side and said, hey, how can we help?

1376
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Yeah, we're supporting you in this campaign.

1377
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Here's what I'm bringing to the table.

1378
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
These snipers, J-Tax, we can control aircraft for you.

1379
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
We can pre-plan air.

1380
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
And this is, this is what we can offer.

1381
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
How can this augment?

1382
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000
You how can this help?

1383
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.000
And I'm sure this happened before, but that was the first time that that I was involved in something like that.

1384
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
And had a great relationship.

1385
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Colonel Rainy was the guy's name he must be a general now or retired.

1386
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Probably retired now.

1387
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
But had a great relationship with him.

1388
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
And we just got after it for 11 days out there.

1389
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
It was great.

1390
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
You had a lot of team guys that you out with there.

1391
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
It's six, I think.

1392
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And then we had some Polish ground guys.

1393
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
And then Marzok dep one because they were part of that deployment.

1394
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000
With us it was the trial runner.

1395
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Yeah, no, I saw.

1396
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Those guys turned over with me in Baghdad.

1397
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Okay.

1398
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Because when you guys got to Baghdad from your team.

1399
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Yep.

1400
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
You went to Mosul.

1401
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Yep.

1402
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
And I was down in Baghdad doing a turnover with the Marzok guys.

1403
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Which I knew a bunch of Marzok guys from the old days of doing shipboard deploy.

1404
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
And they were bunch of awesome guys.

1405
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Awesome.

1406
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And then yeah, then I went home.

1407
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000
And then I guess you came down to Baghdad right before I went home.

1408
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Take the PST thing.

1409
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Yeah.

1410
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Yeah.

1411
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
And well, that was going on.

1412
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
We're standing that thing up.

1413
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And I learned a ton there too because you're like,

1414
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
What are we doing?

1415
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
We're protecting the Inter Marquee government officials.

1416
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
And we're not turning over with anybody because it hasn't been done before.

1417
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
And the last guy before allow.

1418
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
We just got blown up by an ID.

1419
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Okay.

1420
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Let's do this.

1421
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Let's figure it out.

1422
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
And so I mean, we were started with one computer.

1423
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
And my CEO from team two.

1424
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
And it was, I was at that computer.

1425
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Just like, he'd be talking to me, dictating things and putting together the mission.

1426
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
And blah, blah, blah, blah.

1427
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
And I was just learning and, you know, chiming in where I could write that out.

1428
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
So you knew there were PSD got stood up.

1429
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Yeah.

1430
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Yeah.

1431
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
One computer and one small office.

1432
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And then it grew into this huge monstrosity.

1433
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I should've actually became.

1434
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
But still learned a lot.

1435
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Yeah.

1436
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
But that also meant that I was an extra, extra dude as we kind of figured out what was going on.

1437
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
And then I got to go up and help out with Marsoc.

1438
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
That one because one of those guys had to go back and do something.

1439
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
So I got to go up and help them out for a little bit on the intel side of the house for a few weeks.

1440
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
And then there was a lot of that.

1441
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
That's when they're job kicked off.

1442
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
And they're like, we need snipers.

1443
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
And so there's grab snipers.

1444
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
And the most together.

1445
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Yes.

1446
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Awesome.

1447
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Awesome.

1448
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Yeah.

1449
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
But I remember the CO team one.

1450
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
So he was attached to that Marsoc thing.

1451
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
So I was essentially working for team one at the time.

1452
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
And I remember him distinctly calling me in because I was the, I was the old man I was taking

1453
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
these guys to do this thing that was kind of ambiguous.

1454
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
We're taking over the city as part of a bigger campaign with two, seven cab.

1455
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
And he said, hey, whatever you do, whatever this means, I don't really know what it meant.

1456
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
I just nodded.

1457
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
But he's like, whatever you do, don't go forward.

1458
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
A friendly lines.

1459
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And I was like, okay.

1460
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Like Roger that.

1461
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
But I didn't mean.

1462
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
So hours of being on the ground, we are pushing forward, taking, pushing the enemy back, going

1463
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
up, getting high ground and calling in the Bradley's and A rooms and coordinating all that stuff.

1464
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So right away, I'm disobeying his order and getting the job done.

1465
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Because that's what it took.

1466
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
But it was incredible to work with those guys and we, and it was a, a hot spot if people wasn't just

1467
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
two, seven cab.

1468
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
It was Army National Guard units.

1469
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
It was air from everywhere.

1470
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000
All coming together, working together for the first time and making this thing happen and pushing the enemy back towards the Ema Molly Moss, which is one of the whole the sites in all of Islam.

1471
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And that 11th day, we had that place all of them in the Ema Molly Moss.

1472
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
So we worked every day, we pushed forward a little bit and then go up, take the high ground, everybody come up.

1473
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
We do that.

1474
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Maybe to be there for a day, though the water would come up.

1475
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
That Army logistics train, which was moving and then we pushed forward again.

1476
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
And it was incredible to be part of that and help out for we could.

1477
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
But then, of course, we have where we want them and is a, you know, brand new guys want to vomit.

1478
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
I want to drop a bomb on the Ema Molly Moss.

1479
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Looking back, you know, the probably not the right decision that we're not.

1480
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
No, no.

1481
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
And, but what are the other daughters in the whole tactical call, but not the best decision.

1482
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
No, no, no, no, no.

1483
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Well, in hindsight and with what I've studied since, you know, bombing one of the,

1484
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Holy of sites in all of Islam probably was not, but not of an outright move.

1485
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
So that was that was denied.

1486
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
But if I thought all of a sudden was in there, all of the body militia was in there.

1487
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
And then they did some sort of a peace agreement, see the Irish thing or whatever.

1488
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
And then we got to watch them all, leave and turn their weapons over to the Iraqi National Guard or somebody.

1489
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
And that was the end of that.

1490
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
So, and then we dealt with with every percussion for over a while.

1491
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
But it was good tactical experience.

1492
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Yeah.

1493
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Because I got to come back and talk about having, you know, sniper weapon systems,

1494
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
but also being able to have a red dot on those things to clear the room,

1495
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
because we're clearing rooms and then using those same weapon systems to set up and do the job.

1496
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
So, got to bring a lot of different ways to make the little put up with become loopholes or whatever.

1497
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
And walls and, you know, all that sort of thing.

1498
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
So, got to bring back and share a lot of that experience.

1499
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
How much longer was deployment once you got done with that?

1500
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
I think like a month or so.

1501
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Okay.

1502
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
So it was kind of like, eh.

1503
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Yeah.

1504
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Yeah.

1505
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
You were just like, so stoked.

1506
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Yeah.

1507
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
It was pretty good.

1508
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
And yeah.

1509
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
So it was a formative experience.

1510
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000
And then it was like, they called it, it wasn't the surge, but the seal teams we called it, the surge.

1511
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
So we got to deploy a year later instead of a year and a half later, I was really held a man.

1512
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
So I got to get right back after it.

1513
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
So yeah, because you came home.

1514
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Yeah.

1515
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Now did you get pulled to the commander?

1516
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Was it your position?

1517
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
So now I'm on your side.

1518
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Second of the assistant.

1519
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Now you're the official assistant.

1520
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
It's in my way up.

1521
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Yeah.

1522
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Second of the amount of charge.

1523
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Which is actually awesome.

1524
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
That's great.

1525
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Yeah.

1526
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
It was amazing.

1527
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Yeah.

1528
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
You're super stoked.

1529
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
You're like, well, I just had that awesome deployment.

1530
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
And now I get to do another assistant between commander.

1531
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
No matter.

1532
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
No factor.

1533
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
And this time you got to do an actual workup.

1534
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Or you did a workup the first time, too.

1535
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Ish.

1536
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
But I was that that third of, so that's what an admin stuff here and there.

1537
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:05.000
It wasn't quite the way it is today where you're only doing admin stuff as that kind of guy attached to the task unit head shed over the earth.

1538
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
But essentially, I was doing a ton of the act.

1539
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
But you're still doing all that.

1540
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
You stood at the workup.

1541
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Yeah.

1542
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
You still worked out.

1543
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
You still went to Mount.

1544
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
You still went to Mount.

1545
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
You still went to Mount.

1546
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
You still went to Mount.

1547
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Not all of them.

1548
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Really.

1549
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:16.000
No.

1550
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Because I was like, head to my deployment with the other east coast team in there.

1551
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
I came back and did a Haiti when that went down.

1552
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Because I was an extra guy.

1553
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
So I got to go down there, which was pretty cool.

1554
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
You make a good strap hanger, huh?

1555
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
You can get one of those guys that kind of like.

1556
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
I didn't actually land like that.

1557
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
I was always kind of like, man, I'm not in the, you know, I'm not in the A.

1558
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.000
I'm not an A.

1559
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
You did a good deal.

1560
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
They could be like, I've heard a run for his money.

1561
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
They was, it was not a bad time to be just a dude hanging out.

1562
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
They could grab it anytime.

1563
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
And of course, I'm like, can you go?

1564
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Yep.

1565
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Yeah.

1566
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Of course.

1567
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Second go.

1568
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
A sweet Emily, me in this afternoon.

1569
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Great.

1570
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
So you, so now you're in your, now you're doing an actual workup.

1571
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
You get to do all the training and then you go on deployment.

1572
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And you go back to Iraq again.

1573
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Yep.

1574
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Yep.

1575
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
And hit her body this time.

1576
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Sweet.

1577
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
So going into her mind.

1578
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
So now it's 0.5.

1579
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
So five.

1580
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Yep.

1581
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Follow up 0.5.

1582
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Of course it changes throughout that workup.

1583
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
You're on here, you're on there, whatever, but I forget it.

1584
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
What time it turned to you are going to your body now.

1585
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
But that's where you, that's where you wanted to be.

1586
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000
You know, five, oh, six.

1587
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000
And so we got to get in there.

1588
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
And no, it was interesting because I forget if there was someone there before us or not.

1589
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
I can't, I don't know why I can't remember if there was a turn of the

1590
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
must have been somebody there.

1591
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
But I, I didn't stand out in my head anyway.

1592
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
I think it was a much smaller depth before you got me.

1593
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Maybe.

1594
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Yeah.

1595
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
And I wasn't part of that initial that first, my head shed goes over first.

1596
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
The head shed went over and then I was the senior guy that came over with the rest of the guys.

1597
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
So I didn't really do when I got when we got there.

1598
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Most of the world was gone and it was, it was just time to time to figure it out.

1599
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
So we got to have a few cool things.

1600
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Like going out with the Marines, dressing up like a Marine, getting left behind to do this

1601
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Napper's thoughts.

1602
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
You know, not exactly what you guys did because you guys really got after it.

1603
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
But, you know, baby steps.

1604
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Yeah, right on.

1605
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
So it was, you know, going just going out with the Marines in the day.

1606
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Yeah.

1607
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Doing those patrols.

1608
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Where this, where the ID threat is high.

1609
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
One of the most dangerous cities in the world at the time.

1610
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Like, that was legit.

1611
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah, that's a, that's a get some evolution.

1612
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah.

1613
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I was just being on the base.

1614
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I mean, but the mortar's coming in, and I didn't,

1615
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
and I stayed, I didn't stay in that, that, whatever the,

1616
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
the build out the building, stayed out in the tents for the guys.

1617
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yeah.

1618
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yeah.

1619
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And yeah, there's nothing there to protect you from the mortar coming in.

1620
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Like, you just sleep in,

1621
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and I'll let's let him a little bit of land on you.

1622
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Yeah, well on the receiving end.

1623
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And then during that deployment as well,

1624
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
you also went to Baghdad and work with an

1625
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
in-dage force there too.

1626
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yeah, that's why I didn't see you in turnover.

1627
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Um, got to do this the second thing in my time

1628
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
in the military that was the most formative

1629
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
and yeah, I've got to do some stuff in Baghdad with a

1630
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
two other DAs basically.

1631
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Yep, yep.

1632
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Doing that with a, come over with a civilian type

1633
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
organization and, uh, yeah, with a little less,

1634
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
um, I guess oversight.

1635
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
You'd say.

1636
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So I loved it.

1637
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I just did fit my personality and my, uh,

1638
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
my drive, I guess.

1639
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Like I was a perfect fit from yet that time.

1640
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Um, actually one of the things that happened during that

1641
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
time was the inspiration for the second book,

1642
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
one of the guys that I met there, one of the, uh,

1643
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
a racky that I was working with.

1644
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Um, but yeah, that was a, that was a great time.

1645
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Learned a ton, we're right there next to, um,

1646
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
guys from Great Britain, other army guys from there.

1647
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Uh, I guess premier special operations unit.

1648
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Um, so when we're doing stuff together,

1649
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
uh, and uh, you had a, you guys had a really good

1650
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
optempo if I remember correctly.

1651
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It was a good time to be part of that.

1652
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yeah.

1653
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So I had a blast doing that, learn to ton, and I got to stay active.

1654
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Got to, got to, got to stay getting after it.

1655
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Not every night, but you know,

1656
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah.

1657
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Good, good optempo.

1658
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Cause it optempo.

1659
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And then you wrap up that deployment,

1660
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
which again, these are, these are,

1661
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
you got some choice deployments.

1662
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I mean, you could was, yeah.

1663
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Choice deployments.

1664
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It was a good time to, look to be in.

1665
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
My timing was good there.

1666
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
But then I get back. So now I've done, well, five deployments in a row.

1667
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And you're married?

1668
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I'm married. Yeah.

1669
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I've got married after that first deployment.

1670
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
So what's the kid count at this point?

1671
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
We are at one.

1672
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Okay.

1673
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.000
One.

1674
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And then, uh, two for the next one and then three for the next one.

1675
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So what'd you do when you got home from that deployment to,

1676
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
with, with, when you got done with your assistant,

1677
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Paltune commander tour.

1678
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
So this is one of my good deal, train ants.

1679
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And, uh, I get back and I've done five deployments in a row.

1680
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Uh, if you count the endless did ones, three is an officer, all of them,

1681
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
get an after it, and they're like, you need to go somewhere

1682
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
and get some professional development.

1683
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Oh, yeah, they did.

1684
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It's like, like, wind your scam, but they put a whole ball that way.

1685
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Yep.

1686
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And, uh, set my exo and, uh, was the ops had been the ops so in Germany.

1687
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So he's like you need to put a Germany.

1688
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
And you need to do your thermo to unit does.

1689
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Um, like, uh, unit two, what?

1690
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Like, that's a place to be in 1944.

1691
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
That's why I want to be, not in 2007.

1692
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
And, uh, so I went kickin' in the screaming and I probably should have just said Roger that,

1693
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
you know, but, uh, you know, I've, uh, five deployments in a row, and those last three,

1694
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
being fairly intense, uh, I didn't want my guys to go back without me.

1695
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You know, I felt like, you know, I'm abandoning them to go to Germany and go,

1696
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
like, taste wine and look at, like, castle walls and these different towns, like, that, no.

1697
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Um, but you gotta go.

1698
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Um, but since I'd worked with that other government agency,

1699
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
um, I got, uh, kind of, I guess you'd say recruited by them.

1700
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And while I'm waiting to go to Germany, I go up to DC and do my bunch of tests,

1701
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
then they put you through up there and, uh, get a class update to go to, uh, to that organization.

1702
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And, uh, so I get to Germany.

1703
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I'm there for a few months.

1704
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's horrible.

1705
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Um, I, uh, well, they think of a different language school first, because they thought I was going to go to North Africa West Africa.

1706
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
How long is French language school?

1707
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Six months.

1708
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I'm going to go to the six months.

1709
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Um, that was actually good.

1710
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But, whatever, good family time, all that stuff.

1711
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But I still wanted to be in a record.

1712
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I'm straight up D.O.I.

1713
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And straight up D.O.I.

1714
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I'm on a, right?

1715
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.000
You helped.

1716
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
You know, yeah.

1717
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Luckily, I was at an off site, so I didn't have to go on pace, so that was,

1718
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
that was good.

1719
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
So that was, I guess, I guess, another key.

1720
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I was keeping it good.

1721
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah.

1722
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And of course, now I find out about CrossFit.

1723
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
So I found it about CrossFit in her body.

1724
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
So now I'm just crushing the CrossFit.

1725
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And, uh, people think I'm insane, um, because no one really had seen that yet.

1726
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It was 2006, 2007, and they're like, what?

1727
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Well, especially outside of the seal team, the outside of, you know, firefighters and all that stuff.

1728
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Just the regular gym.

1729
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
They say you're doing all this swing and burbells around like their kettlebell or whatever.

1730
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Um, so I'm getting shaped.

1731
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I'm training for my next, whatever deployment.

1732
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Trying to make myself better.

1733
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Um, but we go to Germany.

1734
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Get there.

1735
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Hate it.

1736
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Uh, a lot of people that were loving it.

1737
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And that made me hate it even more.

1738
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Um, and I probably should have just said, this is where the government needs me.

1739
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So I'm going to do the best I can along here.

1740
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
And I did the best I could, but you're not doing anything.

1741
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It was awful.

1742
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Um, I shouldn't say that.

1743
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It is a very important place to be.

1744
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And they have a mission.

1745
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Yeah.

1746
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And that's great.

1747
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But it wasn't for me.

1748
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Um, so I dropped my papers to get out to go to that, uh, because I was wanting to get back to what I was doing.

1749
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Interact and bagged at 2006, getting it.

1750
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And, uh, so dropped my papers and, gonna go, just get out and go do that.

1751
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And, uh, then a two weeks later they call me the seal call me back in.

1752
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
So let's say there's a, uh, a, a, an OIC at Team 7 got out, there's a spot open deal on it.

1753
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And I was not expecting that at all.

1754
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And I said, Woah, my mind was already set.

1755
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
I was I was essentially mentally out as out.

1756
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I was training.

1757
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I was getting ready for take to go back down right with this other group.

1758
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And, uh, so when I'm talking about wife, she was breaking it again with number,

1759
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
second child.

1760
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And we decided to stay in them, like, okay, can get, uh, get back after do that leadership role.

1761
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
role that I became an officer to have.

1762
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.56
And we like team seven.

1763
01:05:34.56 --> 01:05:36.000
And that's why I met you right now.

1764
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.24
So now I get my first taste of Jaco.

1765
01:05:38.24 --> 01:05:42.60
And some finally some actual professional development

1766
01:05:42.60 --> 01:05:43.44
that mattered.

1767
01:05:43.44 --> 01:05:45.44
And it's up into that one.

1768
01:05:45.44 --> 01:05:46.48
It's baptism by fire.

1769
01:05:46.48 --> 01:05:47.60
Like you show up at team two.

1770
01:05:47.60 --> 01:05:48.80
Hey, you're going to Afghanistan.

1771
01:05:48.80 --> 01:05:52.24
Oh, no training other than the T-shirt folding.

1772
01:05:52.24 --> 01:05:55.000
And under were folding, it was yes.

1773
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.56
Luckily, I had some really good guys

1774
01:05:56.56 --> 01:05:59.000
on those deployments that had already been

1775
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.24
to Afghanistan that took me under their wing

1776
01:06:01.24 --> 01:06:04.32
that showed me how these nods work.

1777
01:06:04.32 --> 01:06:05.88
The point man only had them when you're last

1778
01:06:05.88 --> 01:06:08.12
but two and the horse of Denver 11 tears.

1779
01:06:08.12 --> 01:06:09.28
I used these things.

1780
01:06:09.28 --> 01:06:11.44
Yeah, and that's kind of the way it used to be.

1781
01:06:11.44 --> 01:06:14.24
It was OJT and the young junior officers

1782
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:15.88
or even the young and listed guys,

1783
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:18.48
you just get trained by the more experienced guys.

1784
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:20.000
And that works great.

1785
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.92
If you're lucky enough to have a good experience guy

1786
01:06:22.92 --> 01:06:25.28
that has the desire to teach you that really

1787
01:06:25.28 --> 01:06:26.40
cares about the job,

1788
01:06:26.40 --> 01:06:27.68
that wants to do a good job,

1789
01:06:27.68 --> 01:06:30.08
that recognizes the importance of leadership.

1790
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:31.80
And then it works fine.

1791
01:06:31.80 --> 01:06:32.64
Yeah.

1792
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:35.40
The problem is that it's not, it doesn't always work like that.

1793
01:06:35.40 --> 01:06:36.40
So you get a guy that's a knuckle,

1794
01:06:36.40 --> 01:06:37.68
you get a guy that doesn't care.

1795
01:06:37.68 --> 01:06:39.32
You can just end up in a bad situation.

1796
01:06:39.32 --> 01:06:42.64
And then some young kids were young,

1797
01:06:42.64 --> 01:06:45.16
we're influential.

1798
01:06:45.16 --> 01:06:46.48
What?

1799
01:06:46.48 --> 01:06:50.32
Where we're very easily influenced.

1800
01:06:50.32 --> 01:06:52.64
And we see how a bad leader acts.

1801
01:06:52.64 --> 01:06:54.60
And they tell us that that's how we're supposed to act.

1802
01:06:54.60 --> 01:06:55.80
And we start acting that way.

1803
01:06:55.80 --> 01:06:57.36
I've seen that happen many times.

1804
01:06:57.36 --> 01:06:58.36
I'd meet a guy.

1805
01:06:58.36 --> 01:07:02.000
I'd meet a guy that would be coming through my training.

1806
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.48
And he wouldn't quite be a good leader.

1807
01:07:05.48 --> 01:07:07.32
And I'd say, let me just be talking to him.

1808
01:07:07.32 --> 01:07:09.36
Oh, who was your Paltoon Chief when you were a new guy?

1809
01:07:09.36 --> 01:07:11.16
And they'd name a guy and I'd say, OK, I see.

1810
01:07:11.16 --> 01:07:15.04
Well, you could very easily find the root problems here.

1811
01:07:15.04 --> 01:07:17.36
Or I'd get a young, oh, I get a Paltoon Commander.

1812
01:07:17.36 --> 01:07:19.64
And I'd say, well, who was your Paltoon Commander when

1813
01:07:19.64 --> 01:07:21.52
you were an AOC and they'd give a name?

1814
01:07:21.52 --> 01:07:23.88
And the guy would be a bad leader.

1815
01:07:23.88 --> 01:07:25.60
And he'd say, OK, well, I know where you got this from.

1816
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:29.08
And they would give me the ability to actually steer

1817
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:31.80
them in the right direction and say, hey, I wouldn't be

1818
01:07:31.80 --> 01:07:33.76
offensive about their old boss or anything.

1819
01:07:33.76 --> 01:07:35.32
But I'd start, like, saying, hey, there's

1820
01:07:35.32 --> 01:07:36.88
another way to look at these things.

1821
01:07:36.88 --> 01:07:39.000
So yeah, sure.

1822
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.36
That sounds like, but you got lucky.

1823
01:07:40.36 --> 01:07:41.56
You had some good leadership.

1824
01:07:41.56 --> 01:07:43.80
I mean, I know who your CEO was at team 2.

1825
01:07:43.80 --> 01:07:45.12
He's freaking out standing.

1826
01:07:45.12 --> 01:07:47.36
And yeah, so you had some good, you know,

1827
01:07:47.36 --> 01:07:48.72
you did some great mentorship.

1828
01:07:48.72 --> 01:07:49.80
Yeah, he cared about it.

1829
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:51.72
He cared about mentorship.

1830
01:07:51.72 --> 01:07:53.44
And his, the senior guy, Steve brought with him

1831
01:07:53.44 --> 01:07:54.64
from his other command.

1832
01:07:54.64 --> 01:07:56.20
Also cared about those senior chiefs.

1833
01:07:56.20 --> 01:07:59.000
They cared about what the next generation of both

1834
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.68
and listed hand officers were going to do and how they

1835
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:02.40
were going to lead.

1836
01:08:02.40 --> 01:08:06.60
And so I was very fortunate to be the recipient of that

1837
01:08:06.60 --> 01:08:09.12
mentorship and that guidance.

1838
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:10.88
And that served me well.

1839
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:14.52
And I had a good foundation anyway, but having that

1840
01:08:14.52 --> 01:08:17.44
have somebody that cared that put a little structure.

1841
01:08:17.44 --> 01:08:22.20
I mean, not, you know, a little structure behind it was

1842
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:22.84
refreshing.

1843
01:08:22.84 --> 01:08:25.60
And yeah, I just took all that on board and just,

1844
01:08:25.60 --> 01:08:28.48
you know, one of the best leader I could for my guys.

1845
01:08:28.48 --> 01:08:29.44
But now it's team 7.

1846
01:08:29.44 --> 01:08:33.000
So that's, now it's, well, it was a good, it was a great

1847
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.12
experience as an OIC.

1848
01:08:34.12 --> 01:08:38.08
But most of that was due to the training that you brought.

1849
01:08:38.08 --> 01:08:40.84
And so now I got to professionalize things a little bit,

1850
01:08:40.84 --> 01:08:41.60
think about them.

1851
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:43.52
And now my deployment, my good deal, train, I thought,

1852
01:08:43.52 --> 01:08:44.88
ended.

1853
01:08:44.88 --> 01:08:46.24
And for it, it's spiked a little bit.

1854
01:08:46.24 --> 01:08:48.16
And we thought, oh, we're going back to Afghanistan.

1855
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:49.72
Yes, and it's going to be you guys, because you

1856
01:08:49.72 --> 01:08:53.04
know, it didn't end up being my opportunity.

1857
01:08:53.04 --> 01:08:55.64
So I got to go to the PI, got to go to the Philippines.

1858
01:08:55.64 --> 01:08:58.000
And first I'm like, yeah, that's a bummer.

1859
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.56
But you ended up being a great experience at an outstation.

1860
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:04.80
Had more special forces guys, working for me,

1861
01:09:04.80 --> 01:09:07.72
then I had seals working for me at multiple outstations

1862
01:09:07.72 --> 01:09:10.24
that reported to me.

1863
01:09:10.24 --> 01:09:13.72
And we were there to assist.

1864
01:09:13.72 --> 01:09:15.16
This has been a wise type of thing.

1865
01:09:15.16 --> 01:09:17.88
But it was with a Philippine Marine general.

1866
01:09:17.88 --> 01:09:20.32
And I've also been down there fighting that in certainty

1867
01:09:20.32 --> 01:09:22.80
in the Southern Island chain, since he was an instant

1868
01:09:22.80 --> 01:09:25.72
or whatever they, you know, a second lieutenant.

1869
01:09:25.72 --> 01:09:30.20
And I know, so I took the role of a student with him.

1870
01:09:30.20 --> 01:09:32.000
And amazing guy.

1871
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.84
And just I really learned the area,

1872
01:09:33.84 --> 01:09:35.000
learned what they were up against,

1873
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.96
learned how the enemy was adapting to them,

1874
01:09:37.96 --> 01:09:41.28
and how it changed over his 30 some years of doing that.

1875
01:09:41.28 --> 01:09:42.12
And of course, he was mentored,

1876
01:09:42.12 --> 01:09:43.92
because they've been doing that for over 100 or plus years,

1877
01:09:43.92 --> 01:09:45.52
they've been fighting that thing.

1878
01:09:45.52 --> 01:09:48.12
So he was a recipient of mentorship and lessons

1879
01:09:48.12 --> 01:09:49.80
from the people that came before him.

1880
01:09:49.80 --> 01:09:53.76
And I took that time, because I noticed that the SF guys,

1881
01:09:53.76 --> 01:09:55.68
the Army SF guys, particularly the Warn Officer,

1882
01:09:55.68 --> 01:09:56.60
that was there with me,

1883
01:09:56.60 --> 01:09:59.32
knew a lot more about counterinsurgency than I did.

1884
01:09:59.32 --> 01:10:01.04
Like I had the tactical kick in the door.

1885
01:10:01.04 --> 01:10:02.44
I had that experience.

1886
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:04.56
But I didn't have that broader piece yet.

1887
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:07.96
And so I took that time in the Philippines to study

1888
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.92
and read a ton.

1889
01:10:09.92 --> 01:10:12.16
And who are the, who are the foremost experts

1890
01:10:12.16 --> 01:10:13.64
on counterinsurgency out there?

1891
01:10:13.64 --> 01:10:14.16
Where are they?

1892
01:10:14.16 --> 01:10:15.08
How are they going to touch with them?

1893
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:16.40
Do they have anything I can read?

1894
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:18.96
And so I just really schooled myself up.

1895
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:21.20
And so it became a kind of a competition

1896
01:10:21.20 --> 01:10:22.56
between me and him in discussions

1897
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:24.04
about counterinsurgency's worldwide,

1898
01:10:24.04 --> 01:10:25.40
but particularly where we are,

1899
01:10:25.40 --> 01:10:27.64
but how that applies more broadly.

1900
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:29.44
So I took it as a time to,

1901
01:10:29.44 --> 01:10:31.24
and we did get to go to the VATE,

1902
01:10:31.24 --> 01:10:32.80
got to do some things down there,

1903
01:10:32.80 --> 01:10:37.80
the film rings, with us just helping with some more technical things.

1904
01:10:37.80 --> 01:10:40.08
But they got to get after it.

1905
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:42.80
And they lost guys, and we were there doing the MetaVac

1906
01:10:42.80 --> 01:10:44.52
and doing all that sort of thing.

1907
01:10:44.52 --> 01:10:47.08
You know, the body's lined up the whole deal.

1908
01:10:47.08 --> 01:10:50.64
And it was, so it ended up being a very,

1909
01:10:51.64 --> 01:10:55.000
I guess, another form of experience for me.

1910
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.32
And then I got to use what I learned about working with the army

1911
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:01.56
once again, but in my next appointment as a troop commander,

1912
01:11:01.56 --> 01:11:03.60
or once again, I had, and I went back to Iraq

1913
01:11:03.60 --> 01:11:07.40
and I had more SF guys working under my command

1914
01:11:07.40 --> 01:11:08.80
than I had sales.

1915
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.88
So it was good.

1916
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:11.72
It was good run.

1917
01:11:11.72 --> 01:11:13.48
So you went through that work up

1918
01:11:13.48 --> 01:11:17.40
on your routine commander in 2008.

1919
01:11:17.40 --> 01:11:18.24
Yep.

1920
01:11:18.24 --> 01:11:19.08
Cool.

1921
01:11:19.08 --> 01:11:20.20
So I was pretty settled in,

1922
01:11:20.20 --> 01:11:22.92
because I had come home in 2006 and 2007,

1923
01:11:22.92 --> 01:11:24.32
I took over the training.

1924
01:11:24.32 --> 01:11:26.44
So yeah, we were going hard.

1925
01:11:26.44 --> 01:11:27.28
Oh yeah.

1926
01:11:27.28 --> 01:11:30.72
Oh yeah, yeah, my first experience heard all about this jacco guy.

1927
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:31.56
Oh, why?

1928
01:11:31.56 --> 01:11:32.64
Who is this guy?

1929
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:37.000
And the first time you walked in to that room,

1930
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.84
that briefing room at Fort Knox,

1931
01:11:38.84 --> 01:11:41.28
the stadium seating, and they had the dynamic things

1932
01:11:41.28 --> 01:11:43.04
up at the sand tables.

1933
01:11:43.04 --> 01:11:46.08
And you came in and gave us this talk, and I was like,

1934
01:11:46.08 --> 01:11:47.08
dang.

1935
01:11:47.08 --> 01:11:49.64
Yeah, let's go get it.

1936
01:11:49.64 --> 01:11:50.60
It was awesome.

1937
01:11:50.60 --> 01:11:53.96
But I had one of my more formative experience

1938
01:11:53.96 --> 01:11:58.56
in training in that particular urban warfare environment

1939
01:11:58.56 --> 01:12:02.16
thing where you probably remember the scenario,

1940
01:12:02.16 --> 01:12:04.96
because you probably did it for most of the platoon's

1941
01:12:04.96 --> 01:12:06.28
and troops coming through.

1942
01:12:06.28 --> 01:12:07.40
But you have a mission.

1943
01:12:07.40 --> 01:12:09.56
And you go out there and you're doing that mission.

1944
01:12:09.56 --> 01:12:12.40
And I'm the ground force commander now, the GFC.

1945
01:12:12.40 --> 01:12:16.48
And I'm there in my vehicle, and helicopter crashes,

1946
01:12:16.48 --> 01:12:18.96
like a few buildings down, if you block down.

1947
01:12:18.96 --> 01:12:21.52
And that comes over there with a radioing for help.

1948
01:12:21.52 --> 01:12:22.64
For a couple blocks away.

1949
01:12:22.64 --> 01:12:24.04
And we still have guys in the building.

1950
01:12:24.04 --> 01:12:25.80
And our guys are taking contact in the building.

1951
01:12:25.80 --> 01:12:27.76
And it's all set up whatever.

1952
01:12:27.76 --> 01:12:30.40
And I'm hearing that, and I'm not going.

1953
01:12:30.40 --> 01:12:32.68
I'm going to deal with this problem first,

1954
01:12:32.68 --> 01:12:34.52
when it prioritizes an execute.

1955
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:35.20
Yes.

1956
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:36.76
But I wasn't quite doing that yet.

1957
01:12:36.76 --> 01:12:38.20
I was like, I'm listening to the radio.

1958
01:12:38.20 --> 01:12:40.16
And I'm hearing that a woman screaming

1959
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:42.76
to helicopter pilot female screaming, like,

1960
01:12:42.76 --> 01:12:44.52
they're surrounding us.

1961
01:12:44.52 --> 01:12:45.88
What the whole thing.

1962
01:12:45.88 --> 01:12:48.32
And like, what do I do?

1963
01:12:48.32 --> 01:12:49.88
And I split my force.

1964
01:12:49.88 --> 01:12:50.88
Oh, yeah.

1965
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:52.36
I split my force.

1966
01:12:52.36 --> 01:12:55.24
And so these two vehicles break in off.

1967
01:12:55.24 --> 01:12:57.52
You're going to go to the crash site, secure the crash site.

1968
01:12:57.52 --> 01:12:59.16
Well, then meet you at that crash site.

1969
01:12:59.16 --> 01:13:00.92
And we'll actually help take another.

1970
01:13:00.92 --> 01:13:01.92
So you know what happens next?

1971
01:13:01.92 --> 01:13:02.76
Yes, I do.

1972
01:13:02.76 --> 01:13:03.60
The saster.

1973
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:04.84
The saster.

1974
01:13:04.84 --> 01:13:05.68
Everything goes.

1975
01:13:05.68 --> 01:13:07.52
And that was the point of the exercise.

1976
01:13:07.52 --> 01:13:08.64
I think if you split your force,

1977
01:13:08.64 --> 01:13:10.44
that, I don't know what happens every time.

1978
01:13:10.44 --> 01:13:12.68
But in this case, it did.

1979
01:13:12.68 --> 01:13:14.88
It was it to end up being a disaster.

1980
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:15.48
We get out.

1981
01:13:15.48 --> 01:13:16.48
We live guys behind.

1982
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:17.92
If we go back in, the whole thing.

1983
01:13:17.92 --> 01:13:19.04
It was great.

1984
01:13:19.04 --> 01:13:19.88
It was great.

1985
01:13:19.88 --> 01:13:22.04
But I've never seen it out with you afterward.

1986
01:13:22.04 --> 01:13:23.48
And I really drove home.

1987
01:13:23.48 --> 01:13:25.60
Yeah, prioritize and execute.

1988
01:13:25.60 --> 01:13:29.64
And if you split your force, you better

1989
01:13:29.64 --> 01:13:32.16
have a damn good reason to split that force.

1990
01:13:32.16 --> 01:13:35.60
Just had a guy named John Strikermier on the podcast.

1991
01:13:35.60 --> 01:13:37.48
The last podcast you couldn't have heard it yet,

1992
01:13:37.48 --> 01:13:39.56
because it's not out yet.

1993
01:13:39.56 --> 01:13:41.48
But he's selling a story.

1994
01:13:41.48 --> 01:13:43.88
He's in Vietnam and this guy's just incredible.

1995
01:13:43.88 --> 01:13:46.64
Sock, just the most insane stories ever.

1996
01:13:46.64 --> 01:13:48.08
And he's telling a story.

1997
01:13:48.08 --> 01:13:50.24
And he goes, yeah, so I split my forces.

1998
01:13:50.24 --> 01:13:52.24
And I put four guys on one side of the valley

1999
01:13:52.24 --> 01:13:53.96
and four guys on the other side of the valley.

2000
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:55.000
And we start moving it.

2001
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.80
And I had to find out.

2002
01:13:56.80 --> 01:14:00.04
Because I mean, this is disturbing to me.

2003
01:14:00.04 --> 01:14:04.20
And so I said, I was like, hey, explain to me,

2004
01:14:04.20 --> 01:14:08.24
what made you decide to split your forces?

2005
01:14:08.24 --> 01:14:09.44
I said, I never liked it.

2006
01:14:09.44 --> 01:14:11.60
He goes, I never, he goes, I split, no, this is what he said.

2007
01:14:11.60 --> 01:14:14.60
He goes, I split my forces two times in Vietnam.

2008
01:14:14.60 --> 01:14:15.84
Other than that, it's horrible.

2009
01:14:15.84 --> 01:14:17.16
I do, because I didn't even like doing it here.

2010
01:14:17.16 --> 01:14:18.48
I didn't have a choice.

2011
01:14:18.48 --> 01:14:20.36
So that is a true statement.

2012
01:14:20.36 --> 01:14:21.36
That is a true statement.

2013
01:14:21.36 --> 01:14:23.52
If you can avoid splitting your forces,

2014
01:14:23.52 --> 01:14:24.80
avoid splitting your forces.

2015
01:14:24.80 --> 01:14:26.60
And if you have to, you better have a damn good plan.

2016
01:14:26.60 --> 01:14:28.24
You better have a damn good reason.

2017
01:14:28.24 --> 01:14:31.96
Because when then when you add enemy fire into it,

2018
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:36.72
trying to link up forces friendly forces under enemy fire,

2019
01:14:36.72 --> 01:14:39.20
I believe that's the hardest thing to do in combat.

2020
01:14:39.20 --> 01:14:40.80
I think that's the hardest thing to do in combat

2021
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:45.20
is separate forces trying to link up with enemy contacts.

2022
01:14:45.20 --> 01:14:46.64
Is it freaking nightmare?

2023
01:14:46.64 --> 01:14:47.48
Yep.

2024
01:14:47.48 --> 01:14:48.88
And so if you can avoid it, avoid it.

2025
01:14:48.88 --> 01:14:49.48
Yep.

2026
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:50.84
Have had to do that in Baghdad.

2027
01:14:50.84 --> 01:14:55.28
Once with a QRF that we just talked to on the radio before

2028
01:14:55.28 --> 01:14:58.40
and that was a little dicey, but yeah,

2029
01:14:58.40 --> 01:15:00.48
the knots split in your forces for her ties and executing

2030
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:03.24
never forget that experience.

2031
01:15:03.24 --> 01:15:04.76
And luckily up until that point,

2032
01:15:04.76 --> 01:15:07.96
I hadn't been in a situation where I had to do it down range.

2033
01:15:07.96 --> 01:15:10.96
Because I probably would have done it.

2034
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:14.56
But after that training, I was like, I would think,

2035
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:15.72
I think long and hard.

2036
01:15:15.72 --> 01:15:16.72
Yeah.

2037
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:17.56
Maybe not long hard.

2038
01:15:17.56 --> 01:15:18.40
I would think it through.

2039
01:15:18.40 --> 01:15:20.60
I think it through before doing that.

2040
01:15:20.60 --> 01:15:22.28
So yeah, tough move to make.

2041
01:15:22.28 --> 01:15:23.72
Yeah, that was great.

2042
01:15:23.72 --> 01:15:24.96
For me, coming back from the body,

2043
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:28.60
I was like super paranoid about stuff

2044
01:15:28.60 --> 01:15:32.12
and really into the fact that I wanted people

2045
01:15:32.12 --> 01:15:36.32
to not make dumb mistakes that I made or that I could have made

2046
01:15:36.32 --> 01:15:37.32
or that I saw that people make.

2047
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:41.44
Like, so I was pretty adamant to make sure

2048
01:15:41.44 --> 01:15:42.84
that guys were learning lessons.

2049
01:15:42.84 --> 01:15:44.16
Oh yeah, no, it was amazing.

2050
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:45.16
I was training was great.

2051
01:15:45.16 --> 01:15:47.12
And then we went to New Island, of course,

2052
01:15:47.12 --> 01:15:48.32
into the Land of Warfare thing.

2053
01:15:48.32 --> 01:15:52.04
And I was very comfortable with that because at Team,

2054
01:15:52.04 --> 01:15:54.68
on the East Coast, we done that IMT,

2055
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:57.76
individual movement technique, the earlier on, I guess,

2056
01:15:57.76 --> 01:15:58.60
maybe the West Coast.

2057
01:15:58.60 --> 01:16:01.000
So I had done it a couple times already.

2058
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.56
So some of my junior officers that had never done it before

2059
01:16:04.56 --> 01:16:05.80
and they were like, what are we doing?

2060
01:16:05.80 --> 01:16:06.64
What?

2061
01:16:06.64 --> 01:16:09.44
It's not just online and just the old school.

2062
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:11.48
So they didn't quite get it.

2063
01:16:11.48 --> 01:16:13.56
But I was, as a student commander, I was very comfortable

2064
01:16:13.56 --> 01:16:14.28
with that at Nile.

2065
01:16:14.28 --> 01:16:17.52
And so it was, yeah, obviously amazing training,

2066
01:16:17.52 --> 01:16:19.64
especially with the technology that came along

2067
01:16:19.64 --> 01:16:20.48
at the time.

2068
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:23.28
There was no hiding from any mistakes

2069
01:16:23.28 --> 01:16:24.20
that you might have made out there.

2070
01:16:24.20 --> 01:16:26.20
You got the GPS on you and you go back

2071
01:16:26.20 --> 01:16:27.04
and you debrief it.

2072
01:16:27.04 --> 01:16:28.72
And then out of that old school 90s, like,

2073
01:16:28.72 --> 01:16:29.56
no, that wasn't me.

2074
01:16:29.56 --> 01:16:30.56
I think it was someone's over there.

2075
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:32.28
I would never do something like that.

2076
01:16:32.28 --> 01:16:33.12
Oh no, here it is.

2077
01:16:33.12 --> 01:16:35.08
Here's your number, whatever it was on there.

2078
01:16:35.08 --> 01:16:37.000
And you can watch it all in the debrief.

2079
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.40
You can watch your little, watch your little,

2080
01:16:39.40 --> 01:16:41.84
your little, what's that, what's that tank on?

2081
01:16:41.84 --> 01:16:44.64
Your little icon on the ground on the field.

2082
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:47.56
And watch your little icon engage your own forces.

2083
01:16:47.56 --> 01:16:48.56
Yeah, oh yeah.

2084
01:16:48.56 --> 01:16:50.08
You can watch that over and over again.

2085
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:50.76
Right.

2086
01:16:50.76 --> 01:16:52.12
Yep, no, exactly.

2087
01:16:52.12 --> 01:16:53.56
And then going through the second time,

2088
01:16:53.56 --> 01:16:55.76
things evolve and change and all that.

2089
01:16:55.76 --> 01:16:58.28
But going through the second time is a troop commander

2090
01:16:58.28 --> 01:17:00.20
then I was even more comfortable with it.

2091
01:17:00.20 --> 01:17:02.08
Particularly in those those situations,

2092
01:17:02.08 --> 01:17:04.52
I need the lessons we wanted to get out of there.

2093
01:17:04.52 --> 01:17:06.08
And then I could do it a little better,

2094
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:07.28
even then when I was aatoon commander

2095
01:17:07.28 --> 01:17:08.84
because I already learned some of those

2096
01:17:08.84 --> 01:17:10.32
in those particular scenarios.

2097
01:17:10.32 --> 01:17:12.52
But yeah, that was an amazing training.

2098
01:17:12.52 --> 01:17:16.000
And there's no question the impact

2099
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.60
that has had on the field teams

2100
01:17:17.60 --> 01:17:19.68
for the positive way.

2101
01:17:19.68 --> 01:17:21.12
Kared some downmen, did you?

2102
01:17:21.12 --> 01:17:22.76
That was awesome.

2103
01:17:22.76 --> 01:17:23.92
That was awesome.

2104
01:17:23.92 --> 01:17:24.76
Yeah.

2105
01:17:24.76 --> 01:17:26.56
Everybody went down and every time.

2106
01:17:26.56 --> 01:17:27.56
Yeah, yeah.

2107
01:17:27.56 --> 01:17:29.12
It was a lot of downmen drills.

2108
01:17:29.12 --> 01:17:30.96
Yeah, I was a lot of,

2109
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:33.64
I mean, especially, and then what was cool for me

2110
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:34.92
and people always remember that.

2111
01:17:34.92 --> 01:17:37.20
But, but, well, they talked to me about it.

2112
01:17:37.20 --> 01:17:40.28
And sometimes even then, you know, this is too much, you know.

2113
01:17:40.28 --> 01:17:42.84
And the fact of the matter is,

2114
01:17:42.84 --> 01:17:46.80
if your leadership did a good job inside of a task unit

2115
01:17:46.80 --> 01:17:49.56
or inside of a troop, if the leadership did a good job

2116
01:17:49.56 --> 01:17:51.52
and the U.S. decentralized command

2117
01:17:51.52 --> 01:17:53.72
and the fire team leaders got up and made things happen.

2118
01:17:53.72 --> 01:17:54.56
And they kept things up.

2119
01:17:54.56 --> 01:17:56.28
Like if they did those things,

2120
01:17:56.28 --> 01:18:01.12
the trade-out guys, the trade-out cadre couldn't take.

2121
01:18:01.12 --> 01:18:02.64
They couldn't put a bunch of people down

2122
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:04.28
because they would get their asses kicked

2123
01:18:04.28 --> 01:18:06.72
by the troop, the troop would crush them.

2124
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:09.16
And, you know, that one usually not happen early on

2125
01:18:09.16 --> 01:18:10.96
because they would have to figure this out.

2126
01:18:10.96 --> 01:18:13.20
But once they got good at it, like the trade-out guys

2127
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:14.76
would say, you know, they'd be calling up

2128
01:18:14.76 --> 01:18:16.68
myself or the, or the mastery of run it

2129
01:18:16.68 --> 01:18:18.04
and be like, hey, can you bring me back to life?

2130
01:18:18.04 --> 01:18:19.04
Can you bring me back to life?

2131
01:18:19.04 --> 01:18:21.80
And be like, no, man, you, you know, you got killed.

2132
01:18:21.80 --> 01:18:23.20
Of course, sometimes we would bring him back to life

2133
01:18:23.20 --> 01:18:24.92
to press up to an harder, of course.

2134
01:18:24.92 --> 01:18:27.36
I'm not gonna claim that we didn't do that.

2135
01:18:27.36 --> 01:18:30.40
Cause Dale, we're gonna put the pressure.

2136
01:18:30.40 --> 01:18:31.24
Yeah.

2137
01:18:31.24 --> 01:18:33.08
But, that's amazing.

2138
01:18:33.08 --> 01:18:35.72
The down mandrels, yeah, I get you, get you in shape.

2139
01:18:35.72 --> 01:18:38.12
And then, but then it gets people pissed off.

2140
01:18:38.12 --> 01:18:39.88
Like I came back to life and your pissed thing

2141
01:18:39.88 --> 01:18:40.88
not making a decision.

2142
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:43.04
So, and we don't, and the other thing,

2143
01:18:43.04 --> 01:18:45.12
it's that you taught me and I passed on

2144
01:18:45.12 --> 01:18:46.72
and it's, I still think about today

2145
01:18:46.72 --> 01:18:47.84
and it's, like, it's in the book.

2146
01:18:48.84 --> 01:18:52.44
Take a breath, look around, make a call.

2147
01:18:52.44 --> 01:18:54.32
It's easy as that.

2148
01:18:54.32 --> 01:18:55.88
That's, I think about that a lot.

2149
01:18:55.88 --> 01:18:58.08
I gotta do, sit back, get off my gun.

2150
01:18:58.08 --> 01:18:59.92
Look around, what's going on,

2151
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:01.68
what's the satiactical situation?

2152
01:19:01.68 --> 01:19:02.52
And make a call.

2153
01:19:02.52 --> 01:19:03.36
Yeah.

2154
01:19:03.36 --> 01:19:04.20
That's it.

2155
01:19:04.20 --> 01:19:07.56
So simple, so not easy.

2156
01:19:07.56 --> 01:19:10.12
So not easy, like, what it's cool

2157
01:19:10.12 --> 01:19:11.92
and someone like, like, for someone like yourself

2158
01:19:11.92 --> 01:19:13.64
that's a sniper that likes to shoot

2159
01:19:13.64 --> 01:19:14.68
and now it's under your task,

2160
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:16.04
you know, commander, it's really easy

2161
01:19:16.04 --> 01:19:18.52
to get to go right back to what you're super comfortable with

2162
01:19:18.52 --> 01:19:19.88
which is, hey, I'll just get on my gun

2163
01:19:19.88 --> 01:19:21.24
and start killing bad guys.

2164
01:19:21.24 --> 01:19:23.20
But you got 40 other guys that are doing that.

2165
01:19:23.20 --> 01:19:24.04
Yep.

2166
01:19:24.04 --> 01:19:25.44
And none of those 40 guys are actually making a decision

2167
01:19:25.44 --> 01:19:27.20
about where you're gonna go next to save everyone.

2168
01:19:27.20 --> 01:19:28.84
So you're the guy that has to do it.

2169
01:19:28.84 --> 01:19:30.96
So that's a good one.

2170
01:19:30.96 --> 01:19:32.12
Yep, for sure.

2171
01:19:32.12 --> 01:19:33.000
When I look back at old pictures,

2172
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.20
I see how my loadout changed over the years.

2173
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:39.16
And now, five times, I was a true commander.

2174
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:40.60
You know, I'm a lot lighter.

2175
01:19:40.60 --> 01:19:41.60
Well, I've been radios now.

2176
01:19:41.60 --> 01:19:43.60
Two of them, you're carrying radis.

2177
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:45.32
And then I got my mags on my cat.

2178
01:19:45.32 --> 01:19:47.52
Only three in one of the gun or whatever it was.

2179
01:19:47.52 --> 01:19:48.64
But there's a reason for that.

2180
01:19:48.64 --> 01:19:50.80
It's because that, my job is not a control of this element

2181
01:19:50.80 --> 01:19:53.24
and crush the enemy, not to be on the trigger.

2182
01:19:53.24 --> 01:19:55.80
And then what was your, what was that deployment?

2183
01:19:55.80 --> 01:19:56.80
Like where'd you go as a two?

2184
01:19:56.80 --> 01:19:58.96
So that was interesting because it was the,

2185
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:00.84
it was the withdrawal from Iraq.

2186
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:01.68
Oh, okay.

2187
01:20:01.68 --> 01:20:03.76
So we're there six months.

2188
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:07.20
But it was, cause we didn't know if we were staying,

2189
01:20:07.20 --> 01:20:08.72
if we were going, if we were staying,

2190
01:20:08.72 --> 01:20:12.84
or our authorities were gonna be where we were gonna be based.

2191
01:20:12.84 --> 01:20:14.96
There was a lot of questions.

2192
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:17.48
So we had to prepare about to stay long-term

2193
01:20:17.48 --> 01:20:20.000
and to get up back and come home,

2194
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.12
which is what ended up happening.

2195
01:20:22.12 --> 01:20:24.52
So I think we got, they made us our element actually

2196
01:20:24.52 --> 01:20:26.12
in an up going, they had to leave in at the end of November,

2197
01:20:26.12 --> 01:20:27.72
I guess, there was another month there.

2198
01:20:27.72 --> 01:20:32.16
But it was getting, they packed it up in the go home, essentially.

2199
01:20:32.16 --> 01:20:33.64
But you're working with partner force

2200
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:37.16
and you're using your technical intelligence

2201
01:20:37.16 --> 01:20:40.52
to try to prosecute targets so that this,

2202
01:20:40.52 --> 01:20:42.04
it wasn't gonna come a high way of death

2203
01:20:42.04 --> 01:20:44.28
on the way out of there as the enemy just sets.

2204
01:20:44.28 --> 01:20:45.68
Did you drive out of there?

2205
01:20:45.68 --> 01:20:46.52
No, we flew.

2206
01:20:46.52 --> 01:20:47.36
You guys for real.

2207
01:20:47.36 --> 01:20:50.04
I was, they drove out pretty peacefully too.

2208
01:20:50.04 --> 01:20:52.04
Not a big massive convo, I don't see you later.

2209
01:20:52.04 --> 01:20:55.32
Exactly, there's not, now we expected.

2210
01:20:55.32 --> 01:20:56.88
So, but it's cool for a little bit,

2211
01:20:56.88 --> 01:21:00.24
cause you got, I think they got a little more liberal

2212
01:21:00.24 --> 01:21:02.000
with some of the targets there for a while,

2213
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.64
when they're like, okay, we don't with this highway death,

2214
01:21:03.64 --> 01:21:06.08
that's not gonna be on me because I denied.

2215
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:08.52
I didn't wanna let a unit of lateral up go

2216
01:21:08.52 --> 01:21:10.56
when we're leaving anyway.

2217
01:21:10.56 --> 01:21:13.80
So, for a little, we got to do a couple of things,

2218
01:21:13.80 --> 01:21:17.96
but mostly it was a leadership challenge

2219
01:21:17.96 --> 01:21:20.48
to keep the guys focused on their mission.

2220
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:22.68
At the same time, getting ready to go home

2221
01:21:22.68 --> 01:21:24.04
for almost the entire deployment.

2222
01:21:24.04 --> 01:21:24.88
So it was an interesting time.

2223
01:21:24.88 --> 01:21:26.28
That was Bazaar, Southern Rhapsody,

2224
01:21:26.28 --> 01:21:27.20
and then down there before,

2225
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:28.88
the brits had been there first, of course,

2226
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:32.52
a totally different terrain than anything I had dealt with before.

2227
01:21:32.52 --> 01:21:33.84
And it was good.

2228
01:21:33.84 --> 01:21:37.16
It was an interesting deployment at a great senior chief

2229
01:21:37.16 --> 01:21:39.88
and who's still in, who's still in crushing it.

2230
01:21:39.88 --> 01:21:43.44
And yeah, came home, that was the last time I'd ever

2231
01:21:43.44 --> 01:21:45.08
tactically lead guys in the battlefield.

2232
01:21:45.08 --> 01:21:47.48
And I knew that, and it pretty much as soon as we were

2233
01:21:47.48 --> 01:21:51.08
airborne on the way home, like, getting out.

2234
01:21:51.08 --> 01:21:52.52
So that was it, I don't know.

2235
01:21:52.52 --> 01:21:53.92
How many years were you out of that point?

2236
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:55.28
I think I was at 16 right there.

2237
01:21:55.28 --> 01:21:57.64
And what was your family situation at this time?

2238
01:21:57.64 --> 01:22:02.12
So three kids and right, if you're during the second workout.

2239
01:22:02.12 --> 01:22:05.72
So in my OIC, work up the one where I met you

2240
01:22:05.72 --> 01:22:07.36
and then went to the Philippines.

2241
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:09.20
That's in our middle child with born.

2242
01:22:09.20 --> 01:22:11.76
And we found out, I think it was at the,

2243
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:14.20
one, to check up that something wasn't quite right.

2244
01:22:14.20 --> 01:22:18.04
And he ended up, well, I'll get to where he has,

2245
01:22:18.04 --> 01:22:19.36
but we couldn't know what was going on.

2246
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:21.000
It wasn't eating.

2247
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.32
Wasn't meal milestones.

2248
01:22:22.32 --> 01:22:24.28
There was something off in my wife knew right away.

2249
01:22:24.28 --> 01:22:27.000
But it was just like, I just took a gatorly when he's hungry.

2250
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.84
That sort of thing.

2251
01:22:28.84 --> 01:22:30.68
And we didn't know what was happening.

2252
01:22:30.68 --> 01:22:33.28
So all during that second, or that deployment,

2253
01:22:33.28 --> 01:22:34.92
they put me in that exceptional family member

2254
01:22:34.92 --> 01:22:37.20
of category five because there was, you know,

2255
01:22:37.20 --> 01:22:38.60
pretty severely disabled.

2256
01:22:38.60 --> 01:22:42.28
And which means that you're not going anywhere outside

2257
01:22:42.28 --> 01:22:45.08
of your current medical situation for your family.

2258
01:22:45.08 --> 01:22:47.24
So it essentially takes the decision

2259
01:22:47.24 --> 01:22:49.52
out of the service members hands, which is a good thing.

2260
01:22:49.52 --> 01:22:51.20
Meaning you're going to stay.

2261
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:52.20
You were in San Diego.

2262
01:22:52.20 --> 01:22:54.76
So that exceptional service member thing says,

2263
01:22:54.76 --> 01:22:56.80
OK, we got to take care of this guy.

2264
01:22:56.80 --> 01:22:58.20
Well, he's going to stay in San Diego.

2265
01:22:58.20 --> 01:23:00.16
Yeah, so that's a different level to it.

2266
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:02.20
But I was just going to do that during your second

2267
01:23:02.20 --> 01:23:04.36
during your OIC tour or during your two career tour.

2268
01:23:04.36 --> 01:23:05.64
I think you in the two commander tour.

2269
01:23:05.64 --> 01:23:07.76
The first, we're still trying to figure out what was going on

2270
01:23:07.76 --> 01:23:10.44
during that first one and nobody knew what was going on with them.

2271
01:23:10.44 --> 01:23:13.20
So it's a lot of doctor visits, all that sort of thing.

2272
01:23:13.20 --> 01:23:16.60
But my wife did it all because, as you know, when you're in,

2273
01:23:16.60 --> 01:23:18.36
that pendulum has to be on the team.

2274
01:23:18.36 --> 01:23:20.04
That's your responsibility as a leader.

2275
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:21.60
You owe it to the mission.

2276
01:23:21.60 --> 01:23:22.44
You owe it to the guys.

2277
01:23:22.44 --> 01:23:23.40
You owe it to their families.

2278
01:23:23.40 --> 01:23:24.16
You owe it to the country.

2279
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:27.48
Ultimately, to have that be your sole focus.

2280
01:23:27.48 --> 01:23:29.76
And that's out what the pendulum is over there.

2281
01:23:29.76 --> 01:23:32.76
And my wife got that.

2282
01:23:32.76 --> 01:23:35.64
That's what you do as a leader, obviously.

2283
01:23:35.64 --> 01:23:37.72
So when I got back, well,

2284
01:23:37.72 --> 01:23:39.36
yeah, when I got back, we still don't know.

2285
01:23:39.36 --> 01:23:41.72
So now I've done two workouts with this situation,

2286
01:23:41.72 --> 01:23:43.28
two deployments with this situation.

2287
01:23:43.28 --> 01:23:46.92
My wife handled it the whole time, super strong.

2288
01:23:46.92 --> 01:23:49.72
Get back and I go to Buds as the opposite.

2289
01:23:49.72 --> 01:23:51.84
So now I get to see people ring the bell outside that office

2290
01:23:51.84 --> 01:23:54.24
and put the helmet down.

2291
01:23:54.24 --> 01:23:55.60
But in my head, I know I'm done.

2292
01:23:55.60 --> 01:23:58.08
And I didn't make a, I didn't hide it.

2293
01:23:58.08 --> 01:23:59.68
A lot of guys will hide it if they're planning on getting out.

2294
01:23:59.68 --> 01:24:01.72
They won't say anything to anybody in the chain of command

2295
01:24:01.72 --> 01:24:04.08
because they might stay in or whatever it is.

2296
01:24:04.08 --> 01:24:05.28
But I'm like, yep, getting out.

2297
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:06.08
That's 20.

2298
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:08.40
And they're like, no, you're going to be an ex, not a 20.

2299
01:24:08.40 --> 01:24:12.56
And it kind of surprised people when I'd say that.

2300
01:24:12.56 --> 01:24:13.68
Buds is a machine.

2301
01:24:13.68 --> 01:24:14.72
That thing is running.

2302
01:24:14.72 --> 01:24:18.84
And as an opso, it's fairly, I don't know.

2303
01:24:18.84 --> 01:24:20.04
It's not as dynamic.

2304
01:24:20.04 --> 01:24:22.64
Let's say it as a shield team.

2305
01:24:22.64 --> 01:24:26.88
And it's during that, well, a little after that,

2306
01:24:26.88 --> 01:24:30.08
that someone told Ross Perot, our story, the Ross Perot

2307
01:24:30.08 --> 01:24:31.68
and in Texas, the guy.

2308
01:24:31.68 --> 01:24:33.48
And so about your son.

2309
01:24:33.48 --> 01:24:34.88
Yeah, about our son.

2310
01:24:34.88 --> 01:24:36.68
Because you still didn't know what was going on.

2311
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:37.72
All right, so this is 60 years.

2312
01:24:37.72 --> 01:24:39.28
There's a bunch of different hospitals.

2313
01:24:39.28 --> 01:24:40.68
96 years old.

2314
01:24:40.68 --> 01:24:42.000
They have no idea what's happened.

2315
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.96
And all sorts of different diagnosis,

2316
01:24:44.96 --> 01:24:47.16
it's paid for Cedar Sinai going up there

2317
01:24:47.16 --> 01:24:50.72
with the foremost experts to an oxygen my wife

2318
01:24:50.72 --> 01:24:52.88
would take him to an oxygen tank 30 days,

2319
01:24:52.88 --> 01:24:55.28
two hours a day or whatever it was that we paid for,

2320
01:24:55.28 --> 01:24:58.32
just to see if anything would help.

2321
01:24:58.32 --> 01:24:59.88
Someone tells Ross Perot story.

2322
01:24:59.88 --> 01:25:04.84
And this is December of 2013, I want to say.

2323
01:25:04.84 --> 01:25:09.84
And I get a call out of the blue from Ross Perot,

2324
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:11.80
who sounds exactly like Dana Carvey,

2325
01:25:11.80 --> 01:25:14.16
impersonating Ross Perot in the 90s.

2326
01:25:14.16 --> 01:25:16.80
And like what is going on?

2327
01:25:16.80 --> 01:25:19.72
And he's like, I'm gonna, we're gonna fix your son.

2328
01:25:19.72 --> 01:25:20.56
Like what?

2329
01:25:20.56 --> 01:25:23.20
And he's like, I'm gonna send the jet.

2330
01:25:23.20 --> 01:25:25.24
I'm gonna assemble a team of doctors here in Texas

2331
01:25:25.24 --> 01:25:26.76
and we're gonna fix him.

2332
01:25:26.76 --> 01:25:28.60
And then he hangs up like,

2333
01:25:28.60 --> 01:25:29.76
what just happened?

2334
01:25:29.76 --> 01:25:30.64
That was wild.

2335
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:31.48
And about an hour later,

2336
01:25:31.48 --> 01:25:33.96
he's lead doctor at Southwestern Medical Center calls

2337
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:36.20
and says, I know Mr. Perot is called you.

2338
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:37.52
We're not gonna send the jet tomorrow,

2339
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:38.64
but we are gonna send it.

2340
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:41.08
And in the meantime, send us everything you have

2341
01:25:41.08 --> 01:25:43.36
on your son and he medical records.

2342
01:25:43.36 --> 01:25:45.48
We'll assemble a team of genetics specialists here

2343
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:46.52
that will take a look at everything

2344
01:25:46.52 --> 01:25:48.52
and we'll bring you guys in for some testing.

2345
01:25:48.52 --> 01:25:50.28
And see what we can do.

2346
01:25:50.28 --> 01:25:51.56
And it's like, wow, amazing.

2347
01:25:51.56 --> 01:25:54.28
So a month later, they send the jet.

2348
01:25:54.28 --> 01:25:57.60
G550 lands and we get on and head off to Texas

2349
01:25:57.60 --> 01:26:00.52
and go to a week of testing in Dallas.

2350
01:26:00.52 --> 01:26:03.36
And they send our blood all around the world

2351
01:26:03.36 --> 01:26:06.16
and found a genetic specialist in the Netherlands

2352
01:26:06.16 --> 01:26:08.16
who had just discovered the certain genetic mutation

2353
01:26:08.16 --> 01:26:10.40
that helps form in the brain at birth.

2354
01:26:10.40 --> 01:26:12.88
And now it has a name to it.

2355
01:26:12.88 --> 01:26:15.000
It's the three doctors that discovered this.

2356
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.72
But when we found out about,

2357
01:26:16.72 --> 01:26:18.28
he was the 13th person in the world.

2358
01:26:18.28 --> 01:26:20.88
So number 13 in the world, they found with this.

2359
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:23.80
And it was just called NR2F1,

2360
01:26:23.80 --> 01:26:27.40
which is the gene that this mutation affects.

2361
01:26:27.40 --> 01:26:31.000
And being able to put a name to it for us,

2362
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.44
especially for my wife,

2363
01:26:32.44 --> 01:26:34.48
that was so liberating.

2364
01:26:34.48 --> 01:26:35.52
I can't really describe what it means.

2365
01:26:35.52 --> 01:26:36.24
Just to put a name to it.

2366
01:26:36.24 --> 01:26:37.68
It seems like a simple thing.

2367
01:26:37.68 --> 01:26:39.56
But not knowing for six years

2368
01:26:39.56 --> 01:26:40.96
and then being able to put a name to it

2369
01:26:40.96 --> 01:26:43.60
and know that this is just one of those random,

2370
01:26:43.60 --> 01:26:45.28
freaky things that happens.

2371
01:26:45.28 --> 01:26:47.24
And there's nothing you could have done about it.

2372
01:26:47.24 --> 01:26:49.20
And that's it.

2373
01:26:49.20 --> 01:26:50.72
Just we got to put a name to it.

2374
01:26:50.72 --> 01:26:51.88
So it was like, Roger that.

2375
01:26:51.88 --> 01:26:53.92
Okay, now what do we do?

2376
01:26:53.92 --> 01:26:55.92
And for us, that's our mission in life.

2377
01:26:55.92 --> 01:26:57.28
Can we give us purpose?

2378
01:26:57.28 --> 01:26:58.88
And that purpose in mission is to make sure

2379
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:01.72
that he reaches his full potential, whatever that may be.

2380
01:27:01.72 --> 01:27:04.44
But he needs 24, seven full-time care for life.

2381
01:27:04.44 --> 01:27:08.20
So, and we have two kids bracketing him on either side.

2382
01:27:08.20 --> 01:27:09.80
So the real challenge is raising those kids

2383
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:12.24
so that their childhood is not solely defined

2384
01:27:12.24 --> 01:27:13.72
by the brother's condition.

2385
01:27:13.72 --> 01:27:16.88
And hopefully it makes us all more loving,

2386
01:27:16.88 --> 01:27:18.48
more compassionate people.

2387
01:27:18.48 --> 01:27:20.24
And so far it's worked out that way.

2388
01:27:20.24 --> 01:27:22.92
But once again, my wife still bears the brunt of that every day

2389
01:27:22.92 --> 01:27:23.88
because I'm out here.

2390
01:27:23.88 --> 01:27:25.72
You know, I'm having a nice dinner last night.

2391
01:27:25.72 --> 01:27:27.52
I'm here hanging out with you.

2392
01:27:27.52 --> 01:27:28.64
And she's at home.

2393
01:27:28.64 --> 01:27:29.48
Really?

2394
01:27:29.48 --> 01:27:32.48
I'm going to get the bad guy.

2395
01:27:32.48 --> 01:27:33.48
I'm going to go on book tour.

2396
01:27:33.48 --> 01:27:34.48
I'm going to go on book tour.

2397
01:27:34.48 --> 01:27:36.48
And I'm shaking hands and I'm saying,

2398
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:38.48
I'll add, she's got it.

2399
01:27:38.48 --> 01:27:41.48
The wives that the wives are incredible.

2400
01:27:41.48 --> 01:27:43.48
Mine included, she raised four kids.

2401
01:27:43.48 --> 01:27:45.48
And I was barely ever around.

2402
01:27:45.48 --> 01:27:49.48
So, and same thing with every guy that we have on here,

2403
01:27:49.48 --> 01:27:53.48
the talks about what their wives had to.

2404
01:27:53.48 --> 01:27:56.48
And I think Jason Gardner, when he was on,

2405
01:27:56.48 --> 01:27:59.48
he said, the first time he was on, he said, put up with his wife.

2406
01:27:59.48 --> 01:28:00.48
He had to put up with a lot.

2407
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:03.48
And then he came back on and said, like, he didn't mean it like that.

2408
01:28:03.48 --> 01:28:06.48
It's like actually had the strength to handle.

2409
01:28:06.48 --> 01:28:09.48
He just bought the appropriate statement is, hey,

2410
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:11.48
you know, the wives that stick around,

2411
01:28:11.48 --> 01:28:13.48
which is in a big number.

2412
01:28:13.48 --> 01:28:14.48
Right.

2413
01:28:14.48 --> 01:28:18.48
Most women don't have the strength to get through this and deal with this kind of thing.

2414
01:28:18.48 --> 01:28:21.48
But, you know, obviously your wife is insane.

2415
01:28:21.48 --> 01:28:23.48
And as his mind and like, okay,

2416
01:28:23.48 --> 01:28:25.48
you're going to be gone all the time.

2417
01:28:25.48 --> 01:28:27.48
So, I think that's the best thing to do.

2418
01:28:27.48 --> 01:28:29.48
And that's how it has to be.

2419
01:28:29.48 --> 01:28:31.48
So, now, hopefully the pendulum is not quite like this.

2420
01:28:31.48 --> 01:28:34.48
You're like, I'm not dealing with life and death situations.

2421
01:28:34.48 --> 01:28:36.48
So, I can help out a little more.

2422
01:28:36.48 --> 01:28:38.48
But I'm still, this is an entrepreneurial type venture,

2423
01:28:38.48 --> 01:28:40.48
writing is not just writing in a cave somewhere

2424
01:28:40.48 --> 01:28:42.48
and setting it off to New York.

2425
01:28:42.48 --> 01:28:44.48
It's everything that goes along with building a small business.

2426
01:28:44.48 --> 01:28:46.48
So, right now, it's a full-on sprint.

2427
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:47.48
We have momentum.

2428
01:28:47.48 --> 01:28:51.48
And I don't really have any other speed besides just all in.

2429
01:28:51.48 --> 01:28:53.48
So, sort of building this thing.

2430
01:28:53.48 --> 01:28:55.48
But it's not like you're deploying for six months.

2431
01:28:55.48 --> 01:28:57.48
Other things do shift now.

2432
01:28:57.48 --> 01:29:00.48
So, now, even a, like a two-week trip,

2433
01:29:00.48 --> 01:29:02.48
that's like a six-month deployment.

2434
01:29:02.48 --> 01:29:05.48
Relatively now, because it's not the country asking you to do this.

2435
01:29:05.48 --> 01:29:08.48
You don't owe it to the guys or the mission anymore.

2436
01:29:08.48 --> 01:29:09.48
Type thing.

2437
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:13.48
But, yeah, I know I'm super, super fortunate to have a wife that I do.

2438
01:29:13.48 --> 01:29:14.48
She's so strong.

2439
01:29:14.48 --> 01:29:17.48
And Arizona is so easy to leaven now.

2440
01:29:17.48 --> 01:29:20.48
And it has a mental capacity to be able to do your old.

2441
01:29:20.48 --> 01:29:24.48
I'd say. But with only the so few people in the world diagnosed with this,

2442
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:27.48
I think now they're probably up to, must be in the 70s now.

2443
01:29:27.48 --> 01:29:33.48
But, you know, every day is still a struggle.

2444
01:29:33.48 --> 01:29:36.48
And, but that's our mission.

2445
01:29:36.48 --> 01:29:37.48
You know, we got him for a reason.

2446
01:29:37.48 --> 01:29:40.48
And that's, I look at it as we got him because we're strong enough

2447
01:29:40.48 --> 01:29:42.48
to handle it.

2448
01:29:42.48 --> 01:29:45.48
And that's, I don't know how to, you know, house you do look at it.

2449
01:29:45.48 --> 01:29:46.48
I don't really know.

2450
01:29:46.48 --> 01:29:48.48
And then, so as this is going on,

2451
01:29:48.48 --> 01:29:51.48
was that one of the things that made you think about getting out of the Navy?

2452
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:54.48
Oh yeah. So I didn't think about it while I was doing that OSC Platoon,

2453
01:29:54.48 --> 01:29:57.48
or doing my troop commander tour because I was just all in.

2454
01:29:57.48 --> 01:29:59.48
But once I got back, like when that plane took off,

2455
01:29:59.48 --> 01:30:01.48
when we landed in San Diego, when I took a breath,

2456
01:30:01.48 --> 01:30:03.48
realized I'm going to buzz, I see people,

2457
01:30:03.48 --> 01:30:07.48
guys running on the beach, you know, doing the, doing the buzz thing.

2458
01:30:07.48 --> 01:30:09.48
That's not why I came in.

2459
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:12.48
I came in, I came in to do the job, I'd done the job.

2460
01:30:12.48 --> 01:30:16.48
Now I owe it to my family to, to let that pendulum go back

2461
01:30:16.48 --> 01:30:19.48
and take care of them. So it was very obvious to me.

2462
01:30:19.48 --> 01:30:21.48
It wasn't like, it wasn't something I struggled with.

2463
01:30:21.48 --> 01:30:23.48
I think a lot of guys, like, should I get a stand?

2464
01:30:23.48 --> 01:30:24.48
Should I get out?

2465
01:30:24.48 --> 01:30:27.48
What's my, hard time with that transition?

2466
01:30:27.48 --> 01:30:29.48
Mine was not difficult.

2467
01:30:29.48 --> 01:30:32.48
Neither was the decision to get out because I was handed my next mission.

2468
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:34.48
Really, which is didn't care of the family,

2469
01:30:34.48 --> 01:30:36.48
and especially our middle child.

2470
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:39.48
So in that respect, my transition,

2471
01:30:39.48 --> 01:30:41.48
easy, so wrong word.

2472
01:30:41.48 --> 01:30:43.48
But I knew what I needed to do.

2473
01:30:43.48 --> 01:30:44.48
The decision was clear.

2474
01:30:44.48 --> 01:30:45.48
Yep.

2475
01:30:45.48 --> 01:30:47.48
So no wavering.

2476
01:30:47.48 --> 01:30:52.48
And then you knew from your previous, from your childhood

2477
01:30:52.48 --> 01:30:56.48
that the job you were going to take, the job you're going to go after

2478
01:30:56.48 --> 01:30:59.48
after you retired was going to be a writer.

2479
01:30:59.48 --> 01:31:00.48
Yep.

2480
01:31:00.48 --> 01:31:03.48
Yeah. And of course, you can't say that, especially at that time in the

2481
01:31:03.48 --> 01:31:06.48
steel teams, like, you know, the, the men, lot of the stuff is going on.

2482
01:31:06.48 --> 01:31:10.48
And all that. So that's when I played very close to the chest,

2483
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:12.48
I say, to the best.

2484
01:31:12.48 --> 01:31:14.48
So I knew what I wanted to do my whole life.

2485
01:31:14.48 --> 01:31:16.48
And I didn't think about it while I was in the team.

2486
01:31:16.48 --> 01:31:18.48
It was just like, that's what I'm going to do next to there.

2487
01:31:18.48 --> 01:31:21.48
That's the amount of thought I put into writing when I was in the teams.

2488
01:31:21.48 --> 01:31:25.48
But everything that I read, growing up, was part of that education.

2489
01:31:25.48 --> 01:31:29.48
All the reading, the on fiction that I did on in certain season,

2490
01:31:29.48 --> 01:31:32.48
terrorism, all that fit into it, and all the personal experience down

2491
01:31:32.48 --> 01:31:36.48
range. So it's almost like I could not be more prepared for what I'm

2492
01:31:36.48 --> 01:31:38.48
doing now as a writer.

2493
01:31:38.48 --> 01:31:42.48
But I didn't, during those last couple years, I was just like, okay,

2494
01:31:42.48 --> 01:31:45.48
up so I'd buds then to Jean after training course,

2495
01:31:45.48 --> 01:31:48.48
OIC, which was a great result in a couple months, but I love that

2496
01:31:48.48 --> 01:31:51.48
because you get to pass on some lessons.

2497
01:31:51.48 --> 01:31:53.48
And then, you know, move on out.

2498
01:31:53.48 --> 01:31:58.48
But that last year in the Navy, and I think I heard you talk about this before,

2499
01:31:58.48 --> 01:32:00.48
and that you didn't do all these things that you're supposed to do

2500
01:32:00.48 --> 01:32:01.48
and you get out.

2501
01:32:01.48 --> 01:32:03.48
Like, I went into the, what are the taps?

2502
01:32:03.48 --> 01:32:04.48
Whatever that course was awful.

2503
01:32:04.48 --> 01:32:06.48
I could do all those things that you're supposed to do.

2504
01:32:06.48 --> 01:32:07.48
I didn't do anything.

2505
01:32:07.48 --> 01:32:10.48
I heard you say that I'm like, you could, how did you get out of that?

2506
01:32:10.48 --> 01:32:12.48
Well, that was going to tell you what's, I mean, you're big dude.

2507
01:32:12.48 --> 01:32:14.48
You're not, you're not going to tell you you got to do this.

2508
01:32:14.48 --> 01:32:17.48
But I went, I did that course and I went to medical,

2509
01:32:17.48 --> 01:32:19.48
and I went to dental, and I did all this signature

2510
01:32:19.48 --> 01:32:21.48
reason, like, I got my paperwork in order.

2511
01:32:21.48 --> 01:32:23.48
And that was like the whole last year, the Navy.

2512
01:32:23.48 --> 01:32:27.48
It was a spine surgery, had spine surgery in there last year, yeah.

2513
01:32:27.48 --> 01:32:28.48
So that was good.

2514
01:32:28.48 --> 01:32:31.48
And so got all that taken, taken care of.

2515
01:32:31.48 --> 01:32:35.48
But it's during that time when I'm like, okay, my job is to get out of the Navy now.

2516
01:32:35.48 --> 01:32:37.48
Well, now I'm going to start thinking about the writing thing.

2517
01:32:37.48 --> 01:32:40.48
And that's when I wrote down about seven different ideas.

2518
01:32:40.48 --> 01:32:42.48
I put them on the table and front of me, like one page,

2519
01:32:42.48 --> 01:32:43.48
synopsis type things.

2520
01:32:43.48 --> 01:32:46.48
And I chose the one that I thought would resonate with people the most.

2521
01:32:46.48 --> 01:32:48.48
And that's that, that theme of a range.

2522
01:32:48.48 --> 01:32:51.48
Because that's a, that's resonated with me as a kid,

2523
01:32:51.48 --> 01:32:53.48
grown up both in movies and books.

2524
01:32:53.48 --> 01:32:56.48
And it's something that just resonates with people in general.

2525
01:32:56.48 --> 01:32:58.48
Is that theme for whatever reason?

2526
01:32:58.48 --> 01:33:00.48
So I knew the first book would be,

2527
01:33:00.48 --> 01:33:02.48
would that be the theme of the first novel?

2528
01:33:02.48 --> 01:33:06.48
And then when did you start actually writing it?

2529
01:33:06.48 --> 01:33:08.48
During that last year.

2530
01:33:08.48 --> 01:33:14.48
So yeah, outline synopsis started writing title camera really quickly.

2531
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:16.48
All that sort of thing.

2532
01:33:16.48 --> 01:33:18.48
But then submitted it.

2533
01:33:18.48 --> 01:33:21.48
So I got out somewhere of 2016 was my retirement.

2534
01:33:21.48 --> 01:33:26.48
And submitted it to Simon and Schuster in the fall of 2016.

2535
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.48
And I got very lucky, very, very lucky.

2536
01:33:29.48 --> 01:33:32.48
And that friend calls me out of the blue and he says,

2537
01:33:32.48 --> 01:33:34.48
hey, do you know this author Brad Thor?

2538
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:35.48
I said, oh.

2539
01:33:35.48 --> 01:33:37.48
Yeah, of course I know him.

2540
01:33:37.48 --> 01:33:39.48
And he said, well, I know you're writing this book.

2541
01:33:39.48 --> 01:33:40.48
Do you want to talk to him?

2542
01:33:40.48 --> 01:33:41.48
Maybe I submit advice for you.

2543
01:33:41.48 --> 01:33:43.48
And I said, will he talk to me?

2544
01:33:43.48 --> 01:33:44.48
And he said, let me set it up.

2545
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:45.48
Yeah.

2546
01:33:45.48 --> 01:33:47.48
It's a former CEO who's out in the finance world now.

2547
01:33:47.48 --> 01:33:49.48
And they sent next to each other at some fundraiser or something.

2548
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:52.48
And so I get on the phone with this Brad Thor guy.

2549
01:33:52.48 --> 01:33:54.48
And he could not have been more generous with this time.

2550
01:33:54.48 --> 01:33:55.48
It was kind of like an interview.

2551
01:33:55.48 --> 01:33:57.48
It was kind of like a wide, you want to write type of thing.

2552
01:33:57.48 --> 01:34:01.48
That was the underlying kind of theme of our conversation.

2553
01:34:01.48 --> 01:34:03.48
And I think he wanted to make sure I was doing it for the right reasons.

2554
01:34:03.48 --> 01:34:07.48
And you know, told him the truth about my mom being a librarian and reading all this stuff growing up.

2555
01:34:07.48 --> 01:34:09.48
And all these authors I love and wanting to do this forever.

2556
01:34:09.48 --> 01:34:13.48
And he's like, all right, I'm not going to help you as you go along.

2557
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:14.48
So don't send me chapters.

2558
01:34:14.48 --> 01:34:15.48
Don't ask me questions.

2559
01:34:15.48 --> 01:34:19.48
But if you write a book, if you finish a book, I will let seven issues

2560
01:34:19.48 --> 01:34:21.48
to know that it's coming.

2561
01:34:21.48 --> 01:34:22.48
Can't guarantee the open it.

2562
01:34:22.48 --> 01:34:24.48
Definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it.

2563
01:34:24.48 --> 01:34:26.48
If they breed it.

2564
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:29.48
But as a thank you, your friend told me some of things you did in the teams.

2565
01:34:29.48 --> 01:34:30.48
And as a thank you for that.

2566
01:34:30.48 --> 01:34:32.48
I will let them know it's coming.

2567
01:34:32.48 --> 01:34:33.48
And I'm like Roger that.

2568
01:34:33.48 --> 01:34:34.48
And he said, what are you going to be done?

2569
01:34:34.48 --> 01:34:36.48
I said, one year from today.

2570
01:34:36.48 --> 01:34:39.48
And call them back one year to the day later.

2571
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:41.48
And as I did, you remember me?

2572
01:34:41.48 --> 01:34:42.48
And he sure did.

2573
01:34:42.48 --> 01:34:43.48
And I said, it's done.

2574
01:34:43.48 --> 01:34:45.48
And he said, well, it's done.

2575
01:34:45.48 --> 01:34:47.48
He says the best it can possibly be.

2576
01:34:47.48 --> 01:34:51.48
As like, well, no, no, I can still work on it a little more.

2577
01:34:51.48 --> 01:34:52.48
But it's done.

2578
01:34:52.48 --> 01:34:56.48
He said, well, call me back when it's the best that it can possibly be.

2579
01:34:56.48 --> 01:34:57.48
And I said, Roger that.

2580
01:34:57.48 --> 01:35:00.48
So I took another four months of reading, editing, rewriting,

2581
01:35:00.48 --> 01:35:06.48
getting it to, you know, if you've helped out for 10 years, you could probably make it better by degree.

2582
01:35:06.48 --> 01:35:10.48
But I mean, it was at that stage where it was ready for another set of eyes.

2583
01:35:10.48 --> 01:35:12.48
And call them back four months later.

2584
01:35:12.48 --> 01:35:15.48
And he said, okay, I let my editor know it's coming and ship it off.

2585
01:35:15.48 --> 01:35:16.48
And she read it.

2586
01:35:16.48 --> 01:35:19.48
Next thing, you know, I'm going to play in the York and we're having coffee.

2587
01:35:19.48 --> 01:35:21.48
And I think you want to make sure I was in a crazy person.

2588
01:35:21.48 --> 01:35:23.48
And she said, I want this thing.

2589
01:35:23.48 --> 01:35:24.48
But you need an agent.

2590
01:35:24.48 --> 01:35:26.48
And I'm like, well, how do you get one of those?

2591
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:28.48
And so she entered his meet a four agents.

2592
01:35:28.48 --> 01:35:31.48
And then I, I chose one next thing.

2593
01:35:31.48 --> 01:35:32.48
You know, we're off to the races.

2594
01:35:32.48 --> 01:35:34.48
So I got very lucky.

2595
01:35:34.48 --> 01:35:36.48
Yeah, that's awesome.

2596
01:35:36.48 --> 01:35:37.48
It does take a little bit of luck.

2597
01:35:37.48 --> 01:35:40.48
How do you actually mechanically write?

2598
01:35:40.48 --> 01:35:42.48
Like, what do you actually do?

2599
01:35:42.48 --> 01:35:43.48
Yep.

2600
01:35:43.48 --> 01:35:47.48
So all those seven different synopsis that I had at the time.

2601
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:48.48
Where I picked the one.

2602
01:35:48.48 --> 01:35:51.48
Now all those other ones are turning in to these next novels.

2603
01:35:51.48 --> 01:35:53.48
Even though I'm not had different characters or whatever.

2604
01:35:53.48 --> 01:35:54.48
I can morph those ones.

2605
01:35:54.48 --> 01:35:57.48
So I have about seven different novels in the pipe ready to go.

2606
01:35:57.48 --> 01:36:01.48
So start with that idea, the synopsis, like a one-page or two-pager,

2607
01:36:01.48 --> 01:36:02.48
then an outline.

2608
01:36:02.48 --> 01:36:05.48
And then as I write, I fill in that outline because new things.

2609
01:36:05.48 --> 01:36:07.48
Any ideas come up, new chapters, new characters.

2610
01:36:07.48 --> 01:36:08.48
And I added to that outline.

2611
01:36:08.48 --> 01:36:11.48
So that, and it was in Word up until very recently.

2612
01:36:11.48 --> 01:36:14.48
And I, so I have a visual representation.

2613
01:36:14.48 --> 01:36:15.48
What's, what do you switch to for Word?

2614
01:36:15.48 --> 01:36:16.48
To a scriptner.

2615
01:36:16.48 --> 01:36:17.48
Oh, okay.

2616
01:36:17.48 --> 01:36:18.48
We shall get to here in a second.

2617
01:36:18.48 --> 01:36:19.48
Game changing.

2618
01:36:19.48 --> 01:36:23.48
So yeah, in words, your scroll and copying and pasting,

2619
01:36:23.48 --> 01:36:24.48
moving chapters around.

2620
01:36:24.48 --> 01:36:26.48
And then, you know, I don't want to cut.

2621
01:36:26.48 --> 01:36:29.48
And then I have a disappear because the nervous is it backed up?

2622
01:36:29.48 --> 01:36:30.48
Oh my god.

2623
01:36:30.48 --> 01:36:34.48
So, so yeah, so I'm feeling that a little bit paranoid.

2624
01:36:34.48 --> 01:36:35.48
Exactly.

2625
01:36:35.48 --> 01:36:36.48
Don't even cut in face.

2626
01:36:36.48 --> 01:36:37.48
I want to copy it.

2627
01:36:37.48 --> 01:36:38.48
Just in case.

2628
01:36:38.48 --> 01:36:39.48
Just in case.

2629
01:36:39.48 --> 01:36:41.48
The power goes out at that moment.

2630
01:36:41.48 --> 01:36:43.48
Something that I hit the wrong thing and it's gone.

2631
01:36:43.48 --> 01:36:47.48
So, yeah, I fill in that outline till I'd say about 75%.

2632
01:36:47.48 --> 01:36:52.48
And then it becomes not as efficient for me to continue to just have an outline.

2633
01:36:52.48 --> 01:36:53.48
That's now very complete.

2634
01:36:53.48 --> 01:36:57.48
Now, I can just transition to just the story about that point.

2635
01:36:57.48 --> 01:36:59.48
But you know, recently, I found out about this thing,

2636
01:36:59.48 --> 01:37:00.48
Scrivener.

2637
01:37:00.48 --> 01:37:03.48
And that it's set up very much like Word.

2638
01:37:03.48 --> 01:37:06.48
But you, it's broken down by chapter.

2639
01:37:06.48 --> 01:37:09.48
So you can drag and drop chapters and see how it looks.

2640
01:37:09.48 --> 01:37:11.48
You can have each one of those chapters have a synopsis.

2641
01:37:11.48 --> 01:37:13.48
So it shows up as essentially like a car,

2642
01:37:13.48 --> 01:37:16.48
gray yellow sticky, and you're looking at this whole thing.

2643
01:37:16.48 --> 01:37:17.48
And they go, you know what?

2644
01:37:17.48 --> 01:37:19.48
Chapter six should really be Chapter three.

2645
01:37:19.48 --> 01:37:20.48
Drag, drop.

2646
01:37:20.48 --> 01:37:22.48
And you can move in research.

2647
01:37:22.48 --> 01:37:25.48
So you can drag in articles from online, pictures,

2648
01:37:25.48 --> 01:37:27.48
video, into research folders.

2649
01:37:27.48 --> 01:37:29.48
So it's all right there.

2650
01:37:29.48 --> 01:37:30.48
Instead of like, what file was that?

2651
01:37:30.48 --> 01:37:31.48
Did I copy?

2652
01:37:31.48 --> 01:37:38.48
You are like a day late and eight books to late for me at this point.

2653
01:37:38.48 --> 01:37:42.48
Seriously, like that sounds like brilliance.

2654
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:43.48
Yeah.

2655
01:37:43.48 --> 01:37:44.48
And I could so use that.

2656
01:37:44.48 --> 01:37:47.48
And I just finished my eighth book.

2657
01:37:47.48 --> 01:37:48.48
Nice.

2658
01:37:48.48 --> 01:37:50.48
So that sucks.

2659
01:37:50.48 --> 01:37:51.48
Yeah.

2660
01:37:51.48 --> 01:37:52.48
Well, for nine.

2661
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:53.48
Yeah.

2662
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:54.48
And for nine.

2663
01:37:54.48 --> 01:37:56.48
Which I started yesterday.

2664
01:37:56.48 --> 01:37:57.48
Yep.

2665
01:37:57.48 --> 01:37:58.48
And can import from words.

2666
01:37:58.48 --> 01:38:01.48
So I had about half of the, you import from word and it breaks it into chapters.

2667
01:38:01.48 --> 01:38:04.48
You just put an icon and let it know whatever that little symbol is.

2668
01:38:04.48 --> 01:38:06.48
Where you want the chapter breaks.

2669
01:38:06.48 --> 01:38:07.48
And then can you export it back to word?

2670
01:38:07.48 --> 01:38:08.48
And I haven't done that yet.

2671
01:38:08.48 --> 01:38:12.48
So I will be doing that in the next couple of weeks for book three.

2672
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:15.48
But I have not actually, I've imported from word.

2673
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:16.48
I've not exported.

2674
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:17.48
So you can say you can.

2675
01:38:17.48 --> 01:38:18.48
Yep.

2676
01:38:18.48 --> 01:38:20.48
They say you can in the tutorial video and they show you how.

2677
01:38:20.48 --> 01:38:21.48
But I've not done that.

2678
01:38:21.48 --> 01:38:22.48
Check.

2679
01:38:22.48 --> 01:38:23.48
Yeah.

2680
01:38:23.48 --> 01:38:24.48
Yeah.

2681
01:38:24.48 --> 01:38:24.48
I'm all over it.

2682
01:38:24.48 --> 01:38:25.48
Good night.

2683
01:38:25.48 --> 01:38:26.48
I like it word.

2684
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:30.48
So before we nerd out too hard on this, we'll move under something else.

2685
01:38:30.48 --> 01:38:31.48
Yeah.

2686
01:38:31.48 --> 01:38:35.48
So you get done with these.

2687
01:38:35.48 --> 01:38:37.48
And where did you, I mean, what did you do with your family?

2688
01:38:37.48 --> 01:38:40.48
Once you retired because you have the mission of your kid.

2689
01:38:40.48 --> 01:38:41.48
Yep.

2690
01:38:41.48 --> 01:38:42.48
And your kids.

2691
01:38:42.48 --> 01:38:44.48
You had the mission now that you got to finish this book.

2692
01:38:44.48 --> 01:38:46.48
Did you finish that book while you're still active?

2693
01:38:46.48 --> 01:38:47.48
No.

2694
01:38:47.48 --> 01:38:49.48
So I finished it just a four months afterwards.

2695
01:38:49.48 --> 01:38:54.48
So you set yourself up financially somewhat that you were in a survival scenario even without

2696
01:38:54.48 --> 01:38:56.48
Alternating Compass, I'd your retirement.

2697
01:38:56.48 --> 01:38:58.48
I had other businesses.

2698
01:38:58.48 --> 01:39:01.48
You had some other little, you had some other little side things going on.

2699
01:39:01.48 --> 01:39:02.48
Yeah.

2700
01:39:02.48 --> 01:39:03.48
You've got enough money to float this gig.

2701
01:39:03.48 --> 01:39:04.48
Yep.

2702
01:39:04.48 --> 01:39:08.48
I have an operation in Hawaii, a hunting operation out there with a couple of the partners.

2703
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:10.48
Every show off in someone who has made these.

2704
01:39:10.48 --> 01:39:11.48
I'm speaking or whatever.

2705
01:39:11.48 --> 01:39:12.48
That sort of thing.

2706
01:39:12.48 --> 01:39:14.48
It's a tactical training.

2707
01:39:14.48 --> 01:39:16.48
A little things like that.

2708
01:39:16.48 --> 01:39:20.48
I was set up to be able to move into this financially.

2709
01:39:20.48 --> 01:39:23.48
And then where did you move to?

2710
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:27.48
So we got out and we weren't planning on moving because our son, we thought, hey, we have this,

2711
01:39:27.48 --> 01:39:31.48
the support network built up now over the last six, seven years.

2712
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:34.48
It's here in San Diego and we can never move.

2713
01:39:34.48 --> 01:39:38.48
We can't, we definitely can't go someplace where it's cold because he just lies down.

2714
01:39:38.48 --> 01:39:42.48
And just, anyway, it would be very difficult to take him to a place where it was rainy,

2715
01:39:42.48 --> 01:39:45.48
where it was snowy, where he had to put extra clothes on him.

2716
01:39:45.48 --> 01:39:46.48
Like that sort of thing.

2717
01:39:46.48 --> 01:39:51.48
And then we go to Park City, Utah, the winter after I get out.

2718
01:39:51.48 --> 01:39:54.48
And we took our son on vacation with us for the first time.

2719
01:39:54.48 --> 01:39:57.48
And we started going to Park City during my last couple of years when I'm not.

2720
01:39:57.48 --> 01:39:58.48
So I built up a ton of leave.

2721
01:39:58.48 --> 01:40:01.48
I never took leave in hotels last couple of years.

2722
01:40:01.48 --> 01:40:05.48
Because last couple of years, I'm like, well, I'm not taking guys down range anymore.

2723
01:40:05.48 --> 01:40:07.48
Let's start taking some leave.

2724
01:40:07.48 --> 01:40:08.48
We have all this on the books.

2725
01:40:08.48 --> 01:40:14.48
So we go to Park City with a friend from San Diego because he's easier to fly to Salt Lake and drive to Park City.

2726
01:40:14.48 --> 01:40:18.48
And it was the drive through bands of traffic to get to the mammoth or Big Bear or whatever else.

2727
01:40:18.48 --> 01:40:21.48
So we started doing that last couple of years.

2728
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:23.48
And then we took our son on vacation with us.

2729
01:40:23.48 --> 01:40:25.48
And then we took someone with us to help.

2730
01:40:25.48 --> 01:40:27.48
So we had an extra set of hands.

2731
01:40:27.48 --> 01:40:29.48
But we got there and we spent two weeks up in Park City.

2732
01:40:29.48 --> 01:40:31.48
And we thought, you know what, we can do this.

2733
01:40:31.48 --> 01:40:33.48
We're not tied to San Diego.

2734
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:34.48
We brought someone.

2735
01:40:34.48 --> 01:40:36.48
Yes, there was your full time.

2736
01:40:36.48 --> 01:40:38.48
Yes, but we did it.

2737
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:42.48
And that was like, that opened just three doors for us.

2738
01:40:42.48 --> 01:40:44.48
And that we didn't think we're open to us ever.

2739
01:40:44.48 --> 01:40:47.48
And while we were there, I opened this magazine and said,

2740
01:40:47.48 --> 01:40:49.48
Hey, look at this house around the corner here.

2741
01:40:49.48 --> 01:40:50.48
Let's go check this thing out.

2742
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:52.48
So we drove around the corner, checked it out.

2743
01:40:52.48 --> 01:40:53.48
And we're like, let's move.

2744
01:40:53.48 --> 01:40:55.48
We decided to ride that in there to move.

2745
01:40:55.48 --> 01:40:57.48
And got the house.

2746
01:40:57.48 --> 01:40:58.48
And six months later we're there.

2747
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:04.48
And I think it helped to make a physical and psychological break with the military for me.

2748
01:41:04.48 --> 01:41:07.48
Because I was in Coronado and as the opposite of Buds,

2749
01:41:07.48 --> 01:41:09.48
I saw so many guys that couldn't let it go.

2750
01:41:09.48 --> 01:41:12.48
And obviously it's a huge part of who I am.

2751
01:41:12.48 --> 01:41:15.48
It's in my, in my novels and all that stuff is a huge part of me.

2752
01:41:15.48 --> 01:41:18.48
But I saw guys that kept coming back to Buds kept calling me as the obso.

2753
01:41:18.48 --> 01:41:19.48
Can I get a tour?

2754
01:41:19.48 --> 01:41:20.48
I want to show somebody around.

2755
01:41:20.48 --> 01:41:22.48
You know, problem come on in, you know.

2756
01:41:22.48 --> 01:41:23.48
I pull them out.

2757
01:41:23.48 --> 01:41:25.48
But I saw these couldn't let it go.

2758
01:41:25.48 --> 01:41:27.48
Going to all the charity events.

2759
01:41:27.48 --> 01:41:31.48
Going to the same bar is going to the same grocery store, especially in Coronado.

2760
01:41:31.48 --> 01:41:32.48
Yeah.

2761
01:41:32.48 --> 01:41:36.48
So I think for me, it was healthy to say that was one chapter of my life.

2762
01:41:36.48 --> 01:41:37.48
Obviously a huge influence on him.

2763
01:41:37.48 --> 01:41:39.48
I wanted to do it my whole life.

2764
01:41:39.48 --> 01:41:40.48
But now I'm moving forward.

2765
01:41:40.48 --> 01:41:42.48
And now there's a new chapter.

2766
01:41:42.48 --> 01:41:43.48
And that's as an author.

2767
01:41:43.48 --> 01:41:48.48
And that's taking care of my family and raising our kids to be good citizens and good people.

2768
01:41:48.48 --> 01:41:50.48
And that's what I'm going to do next.

2769
01:41:50.48 --> 01:41:54.48
I think it just helped to not run into somebody at the grocery store from a pool to an empty building.

2770
01:41:54.48 --> 01:41:55.48
Who's your CEO?

2771
01:41:55.48 --> 01:41:58.48
What's, you know, and all those sorts of same questions.

2772
01:41:58.48 --> 01:42:00.48
They just keep that tie.

2773
01:42:00.48 --> 01:42:02.48
So being able to say goodbye to San Diego.

2774
01:42:02.48 --> 01:42:03.48
No, San Diego is great to us.

2775
01:42:03.48 --> 01:42:04.48
Love San Diego.

2776
01:42:04.48 --> 01:42:05.48
Love Coronado.

2777
01:42:05.48 --> 01:42:08.48
That was one part of our life in our new life is in the mountains.

2778
01:42:08.48 --> 01:42:09.48
Face in our kids in a ski town.

2779
01:42:09.48 --> 01:42:12.48
And you're super stoked right now on that.

2780
01:42:12.48 --> 01:42:14.48
Yeah, love it over there.

2781
01:42:14.48 --> 01:42:15.48
Love it over there.

2782
01:42:15.48 --> 01:42:16.48
And we got there.

2783
01:42:16.48 --> 01:42:17.48
We drove.

2784
01:42:17.48 --> 01:42:18.48
We put that the you haul.

2785
01:42:18.48 --> 01:42:20.48
Then we drove through the night and all that.

2786
01:42:20.48 --> 01:42:21.48
And we get there.

2787
01:42:21.48 --> 01:42:23.48
13 hours later because we're chugging along with this you haul.

2788
01:42:23.48 --> 01:42:25.48
And we get unloaded.

2789
01:42:25.48 --> 01:42:26.48
And the next day we go to the grocery store.

2790
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:27.48
And we look around.

2791
01:42:27.48 --> 01:42:30.48
And we're like, man, people in Park City are in good shape.

2792
01:42:30.48 --> 01:42:32.48
Like we thought we were in pretty good shape in San Diego.

2793
01:42:32.48 --> 01:42:34.48
Like these people are in the same in Park City.

2794
01:42:34.48 --> 01:42:38.48
Just draws these people that want to raise their kids and ski

2795
01:42:38.48 --> 01:42:39.48
towns.

2796
01:42:39.48 --> 01:42:42.48
Usually they've done something somewhere else where they, you know,

2797
01:42:42.48 --> 01:42:44.48
they're not whatever they can live there.

2798
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:47.48
And they're really into being in shape.

2799
01:42:47.48 --> 01:42:52.48
And being the best people physically mentally spiritually whatever.

2800
01:42:52.48 --> 01:42:54.48
Just being the best, most efficient people they can be.

2801
01:42:54.48 --> 01:42:56.48
And luckily, he had some friends up there already.

2802
01:42:56.48 --> 01:43:00.48
And this insane group of guys that works out the morning wake up at five.

2803
01:43:00.48 --> 01:43:03.48
And once again, that pendulum this last few months has been on the right

2804
01:43:03.48 --> 01:43:04.48
thing.

2805
01:43:04.48 --> 01:43:08.48
But when I first got there, I start working out with these guys that I knew from before.

2806
01:43:08.48 --> 01:43:10.48
And I hope you darling is kind of the lead of that.

2807
01:43:10.48 --> 01:43:13.48
Used to be the CEO of Skull Candy.

2808
01:43:13.48 --> 01:43:16.48
And I see you or he has a bunch of other ventures.

2809
01:43:16.48 --> 01:43:19.48
But this guy is in insane shape.

2810
01:43:19.48 --> 01:43:22.48
And he's there every morning at five thirty with some crazy work out.

2811
01:43:22.48 --> 01:43:25.48
Like picture your hardest crossfit work out.

2812
01:43:25.48 --> 01:43:28.48
And then times it by three or four had some trail running.

2813
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:29.48
It's crazy.

2814
01:43:29.48 --> 01:43:31.48
And so I showed up with these guys.

2815
01:43:31.48 --> 01:43:33.48
And they're awesome.

2816
01:43:33.48 --> 01:43:35.48
But they're all about just human potential.

2817
01:43:35.48 --> 01:43:37.48
I think is the best way to put it.

2818
01:43:37.48 --> 01:43:39.48
And maximizing that potential.

2819
01:43:39.48 --> 01:43:43.48
Whether it's your family, whether it's in business, personally, whatever.

2820
01:43:43.48 --> 01:43:48.48
Just and stand up to date on the latest and the greatest and test and things out.

2821
01:43:48.48 --> 01:43:50.48
And they're an amazing group of people.

2822
01:43:50.48 --> 01:43:53.48
So I'm very fortunate to get to work out and spend time with them.

2823
01:43:53.48 --> 01:43:54.48
So all high performers.

2824
01:43:54.48 --> 01:43:55.48
We all push each other.

2825
01:43:55.48 --> 01:43:57.48
And even though I'm not the not the fastest anymore.

2826
01:43:57.48 --> 01:44:02.48
Especially with this crew, it's it's cool to get out there and and just be,

2827
01:44:02.48 --> 01:44:03.48
you know, just be together.

2828
01:44:03.48 --> 01:44:05.48
That a little team.

2829
01:44:05.48 --> 01:44:06.48
Awesome.

2830
01:44:06.48 --> 01:44:08.48
Well, I mean, it looks like we're in a pretty good.

2831
01:44:08.48 --> 01:44:12.48
That's that gets us to today, you know, where you're at.

2832
01:44:12.48 --> 01:44:15.48
Probably you could place to wrap the books.

2833
01:44:15.48 --> 01:44:17.48
Tell us just a little bit about the books.

2834
01:44:17.48 --> 01:44:19.48
What do we need to know about book one book two?

2835
01:44:19.48 --> 01:44:20.48
Yeah.

2836
01:44:20.48 --> 01:44:26.48
So the first ones, the terminal list, which I didn't say it out loud for about for the first year I was working on it.

2837
01:44:26.48 --> 01:44:27.48
And I said it out loud for the first time.

2838
01:44:27.48 --> 01:44:29.48
There's two else next to each other.

2839
01:44:29.48 --> 01:44:30.48
And I said it for the first time.

2840
01:44:30.48 --> 01:44:31.48
I was like, dang it.

2841
01:44:31.48 --> 01:44:34.48
Like it's a tough one to say the terminal list.

2842
01:44:34.48 --> 01:44:36.48
But it's based level.

2843
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:38.48
It is a story of revenge without constraint.

2844
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:40.48
And that's what I wanted to explore.

2845
01:44:40.48 --> 01:44:44.48
And I think it was a door to team five ops, 1997.

2846
01:44:44.48 --> 01:44:54.48
I saw that it's somebody Syrock's to copy a thing from the brand new internet that had a picture of a samurai on it.

2847
01:44:54.48 --> 01:44:59.48
It said something about a samurai going into battle thinking they were already dead.

2848
01:44:59.48 --> 01:45:09.48
And you know, I went back and looked at a lot of the shuto books from high school and college and thought, oh, they did that because they thought it made a more effective and efficient lawyers.

2849
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:11.48
They're going into battle already dead.

2850
01:45:11.48 --> 01:45:13.48
So I thought, how do you do that with a modern lawyer?

2851
01:45:13.48 --> 01:45:16.48
How do you do that with someone that has a background similar to mine?

2852
01:45:16.48 --> 01:45:23.48
So I can explore these feelings and emotions behind different experiences that I had downrange and a completely fictional sense.

2853
01:45:23.48 --> 01:45:25.48
How do I make him already dead?

2854
01:45:25.48 --> 01:45:28.48
And then I thought about the church hearings in the late 70s.

2855
01:45:28.48 --> 01:45:38.48
And now the government had tested certain drugs on our nation soldiers on mental patients, mental institutions, college students without any review.

2856
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:44.48
Any sort of structured in place with how that's going to go down and things changed after that.

2857
01:45:44.48 --> 01:45:46.48
And I thought, what if somebody didn't get that memo?

2858
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:51.48
But if there was something they wanted to test out, they wanted to test it out on some of our nation's most elite soldiers.

2859
01:45:51.48 --> 01:45:53.48
And then something goes wrong.

2860
01:45:53.48 --> 01:45:56.48
So how do I free this guy up to think he's already dead?

2861
01:45:56.48 --> 01:46:04.48
And they come back and have to use the tactics, techniques and procedures of the enemy on home soil.

2862
01:46:04.48 --> 01:46:14.48
So essentially I wanted someone that thought they were already dead that now gets to bring what was so effective against us in Iraq and Afghanistan to home soil as he works his way up a list,

2863
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:17.48
putting the bad guys in the ground, one by one.

2864
01:46:17.48 --> 01:46:26.48
So that's really what that first one's about. And then if you dig a little deeper into it more psychological wise, I guess.

2865
01:46:26.48 --> 01:46:35.48
It's about a veteran that comes home and brings the wars from Iraq and Afghanistan home to people that have been sending young men and women to their deaths for close.

2866
01:46:35.48 --> 01:46:38.48
Well, coming up on 20 years now pretty soon.

2867
01:46:38.48 --> 01:46:42.48
So you can read it like that too, but that's deep.

2868
01:46:42.48 --> 01:46:43.48
That's deep.

2869
01:46:43.48 --> 01:46:45.48
So you're going to the words you pick up with true believer.

2870
01:46:45.48 --> 01:46:58.48
So it's a continuation of the story. So in high school I saw it's a it was on PBS and it was a special with Bill Moyers and he had an interview with a guy named Joseph Campbell who wrote a book called the Power of Myth and the hero with a thousand faces.

2871
01:46:58.48 --> 01:47:08.48
And I was fascinated by it because while I already go on to write one day and I remember they talked about George Lucas being influenced by this for Star Wars and the samurai aspect of different things.

2872
01:47:08.48 --> 01:47:15.48
And then how across culture the hero's journey is similar, very similar for the cultures that had never touched each other before.

2873
01:47:15.48 --> 01:47:19.48
Yeah, China, Native American Indian Africa Northern Europe.

2874
01:47:19.48 --> 01:47:28.48
They all had this similar journey. And usually it's a reluctant hero that goes on a journey emerges transformed at the end of that journey.

2875
01:47:28.48 --> 01:47:33.48
So that was a big influence. So as writing these, you have to call Mike in the dragons.

2876
01:47:33.48 --> 01:47:41.48
I was just reading that to Mike in the other night. And yeah, so he has to go, he had to go into the cave and you have to emerge transformed.

2877
01:47:41.48 --> 01:47:47.48
But how do you do that with one book and how do you make that overarching a series as well. So there's two things I think about as I'm writing.

2878
01:47:47.48 --> 01:47:51.48
I think about that hero's journey in the context of one singular story.

2879
01:47:51.48 --> 01:47:57.48
And then over what I hope will be a long term series. So that's what I'm thinking about as I write these things.

2880
01:47:57.48 --> 01:48:04.48
And then true believers, the continuation of that story. But it's was inspired by somebody I met in Iraq in 2006.

2881
01:48:04.48 --> 01:48:08.48
And I thought, what have I made this interaction and what I heard through the great fine later?

2882
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:13.48
What have I made this a lot more interesting and fictionalized it? And so that's where the second one picks up.

2883
01:48:13.48 --> 01:48:19.48
And it's really a story of redemption. And taking the, still taking the emotions and the feelings,

2884
01:48:19.48 --> 01:48:29.48
and the feelings, by and certain things that happened down range. But also now exploring what that transition was like, because the hero here in the story James Reese has to go through a transformative journey.

2885
01:48:29.48 --> 01:48:32.48
And the second one's all about redemption.

2886
01:48:32.48 --> 01:48:36.48
And when does when does book to when's true believer come out?

2887
01:48:36.48 --> 01:48:38.48
July 30th July 30th. That comes out.

2888
01:48:38.48 --> 01:48:40.48
Internal list is out right now.

2889
01:48:40.48 --> 01:48:43.48
It is out. Yeah, second one should have come out April 2nd.

2890
01:48:43.48 --> 01:48:48.48
But the department of defense took seven months to do a 30 day review sort of make sure I was honoring my former security.

2891
01:48:48.48 --> 01:48:51.48
Clarences by submitting it to the department of defense.

2892
01:48:51.48 --> 01:48:57.48
You just leave the stuff that they tell you to take out or the stuff that they tell you to redact. You just, you just black it out.

2893
01:48:57.48 --> 01:49:01.48
I just black it out. I didn't know if I ride around it. And my still, you just,

2894
01:49:01.48 --> 01:49:03.48
I don't know if one is you did that in true in the terminal list too.

2895
01:49:03.48 --> 01:49:04.48
Yeah.

2896
01:49:04.48 --> 01:49:07.48
When you said it to me, I, you gave me heads up. You said, hey, I just blocked things out.

2897
01:49:07.48 --> 01:49:11.48
And you know, obviously my books have been, well, not my kids books, but my other books have been through the Pentagon review.

2898
01:49:11.48 --> 01:49:15.48
And they tell you that, get removed certain things and we would remove it and change it.

2899
01:49:15.48 --> 01:49:18.48
So it's acceptable to them, but you just blacked it out.

2900
01:49:18.48 --> 01:49:26.48
Yeah, I was worried like if I ride around this and then I publish it and then when they come back and say, well, you didn't quite ride around that enough.

2901
01:49:26.48 --> 01:49:28.48
But you do that just to be cool kind of.

2902
01:49:28.48 --> 01:49:30.48
And it also has a lot of intensity.

2903
01:49:30.48 --> 01:49:32.48
Help with the marketing.

2904
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:32.48
Yeah.

2905
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:37.48
And it's like, I mean, I was, I was looking through it and looking at like one, and I can, I can figure out a lot of them.

2906
01:49:37.48 --> 01:49:40.48
I got, oh, they, they didn't want them to say that. Oh, they didn't want them to say that.

2907
01:49:40.48 --> 01:49:44.48
So it's pretty cool. But you can still, I mean, obviously you can still understand all the context around it.

2908
01:49:44.48 --> 01:49:52.48
You just don't know a certain like specific term or a certain specific location or a certain specific name.

2909
01:49:52.48 --> 01:49:55.48
But yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty cool.

2910
01:49:55.48 --> 01:49:56.48
Yeah.

2911
01:49:56.48 --> 01:49:57.48
Cool that you left it in there.

2912
01:49:57.48 --> 01:49:59.48
And the books are available everywhere everywhere.

2913
01:49:59.48 --> 01:50:00.48
Yeah.

2914
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:01.48
Every audio people love the audio.

2915
01:50:01.48 --> 01:50:02.48
Ray Porter does the audio.

2916
01:50:02.48 --> 01:50:05.48
He's an awesome to do this up for audio book of the year this year.

2917
01:50:05.48 --> 01:50:06.48
So we're in New York and it's up there.

2918
01:50:06.48 --> 01:50:08.48
Well, I texted you because you're out there.

2919
01:50:08.48 --> 01:50:11.48
You're in your, and you're, you're kind of going, so it's texting you.

2920
01:50:11.48 --> 01:50:13.48
I had to go picture the screen and everything.

2921
01:50:13.48 --> 01:50:14.48
But it's cool.

2922
01:50:14.48 --> 01:50:14.48
It's in it up there.

2923
01:50:14.48 --> 01:50:15.48
It's a Stephen King.

2924
01:50:15.48 --> 01:50:17.48
I got like, that was pretty cool.

2925
01:50:17.48 --> 01:50:18.48
That was pretty cool.

2926
01:50:18.48 --> 01:50:27.48
You, to find you, you got your website, which is official jackcard.com.

2927
01:50:27.48 --> 01:50:30.48
That's it because you didn't buy the URL jackcard early.

2928
01:50:30.48 --> 01:50:33.48
I think an insurance guy has it in the asking room.

2929
01:50:33.48 --> 01:50:35.48
Guys holding it for the hostage.

2930
01:50:35.48 --> 01:50:37.48
And you're never going to get it out.

2931
01:50:37.48 --> 01:50:39.48
Well, maybe you will never say never.

2932
01:50:39.48 --> 01:50:40.48
Yeah.

2933
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:42.48
So that's, yeah, that's a, and that's one that's people want to do.

2934
01:50:42.48 --> 01:50:46.48
And that's people want to geek out a little more on the weapons and knives.

2935
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:47.48
That sort of thing.

2936
01:50:47.48 --> 01:50:51.48
The website goes deep dives into a lot more of that stuff in the books.

2937
01:50:51.48 --> 01:50:52.48
Because you get your nerd on.

2938
01:50:52.48 --> 01:50:53.48
Yeah.

2939
01:50:53.48 --> 01:50:54.48
You get your weapons nerd on.

2940
01:50:54.48 --> 01:51:02.48
You're like, you bring the librarian of your mom to the, to the, to the, the damn jackcard

2941
01:51:02.48 --> 01:51:03.48
weapons scene.

2942
01:51:03.48 --> 01:51:04.48
That's it.

2943
01:51:04.48 --> 01:51:05.48
That's it.

2944
01:51:05.48 --> 01:51:06.48
So it's on there.

2945
01:51:06.48 --> 01:51:09.48
And then on the, on the socials, which I am very new to.

2946
01:51:09.48 --> 01:51:11.48
I'm about a year and a half into this now.

2947
01:51:11.48 --> 01:51:13.48
It's a jackcard USA.

2948
01:51:13.48 --> 01:51:14.48
You know, the socials.

2949
01:51:14.48 --> 01:51:17.48
And there is a Facebook, but three was just too much.

2950
01:51:17.48 --> 01:51:21.48
Like so somebody else just copies and paste things in from there.

2951
01:51:21.48 --> 01:51:21.48
Into there.

2952
01:51:21.48 --> 01:51:24.48
But on Instagram and Twitter, Jack R USA.

2953
01:51:24.48 --> 01:51:26.48
And there's the ones right interact with the interact.

2954
01:51:26.48 --> 01:51:27.48
You're interacting in the game.

2955
01:51:27.48 --> 01:51:28.48
That's it.

2956
01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:28.48
I'm in on those.

2957
01:51:28.48 --> 01:51:29.48
But three years, just too daunting.

2958
01:51:29.48 --> 01:51:30.48
Just kind of, I know it.

2959
01:51:30.48 --> 01:51:31.48
Nope.

2960
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:32.48
No, no, prioritize.

2961
01:51:32.48 --> 01:51:33.48
All three.

2962
01:51:33.48 --> 01:51:35.48
Next level.

2963
01:51:35.48 --> 01:51:37.48
I'm crazy like that.

2964
01:51:37.48 --> 01:51:38.48
That's how super motivated.

2965
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:39.48
I don't have.

2966
01:51:39.48 --> 01:51:41.48
I don't have.

2967
01:51:41.48 --> 01:51:42.48
I'm on three social media platforms.

2968
01:51:42.48 --> 01:51:45.48
Kill me now and well, you know, usually I have a every now and again.

2969
01:51:45.48 --> 01:51:47.48
I have a hard time going to sleep for my mind's racing.

2970
01:51:47.48 --> 01:51:49.48
I'm thinking about all these things, thinking about story line,

2971
01:51:49.48 --> 01:51:51.48
solving problems on the written page.

2972
01:51:51.48 --> 01:51:53.48
Here aggressively, like I used to do on the battlefield.

2973
01:51:53.48 --> 01:51:57.48
But usually I don't have a problem staying the sleep once I get there.

2974
01:51:57.48 --> 01:52:00.48
This morning, up 307 a.m.

2975
01:52:00.48 --> 01:52:02.48
And I'm like, tag and I took a picture of it for you.

2976
01:52:02.48 --> 01:52:04.48
Cause I'm like, oh, did you post it?

2977
01:52:04.48 --> 01:52:05.48
No.

2978
01:52:05.48 --> 01:52:06.48
No, it did it a day.

2979
01:52:06.48 --> 01:52:08.48
So I didn't, you know, I think that would be awesome.

2980
01:52:08.48 --> 01:52:16.16
So I get my my day post on point. Yeah, but I will I will post it. D day awesome. Yeah, so

2981
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:21.84
I think that's a good place to wrap it. You know echo. Mm-hmm. Jack was just talking about

2982
01:52:23.04 --> 01:52:25.44
Fitness. He's talking about being prepared

2983
01:52:27.04 --> 01:52:30.64
Opened up talking about being a true believer that knows the cause

2984
01:52:31.28 --> 01:52:36.40
Yeah, really. You know what do you know about you know sort of that cause being on the path

2985
01:52:36.40 --> 01:52:42.56
Believe it in it truly yeah, fully. I do want to comment on how you blacked out the classified

2986
01:52:43.76 --> 01:52:46.24
Parts of your book is kind of like in the movies, right?

2987
01:52:46.88 --> 01:52:51.12
Or when they want to you know they show movies on HBO or in the cinema whatever. It's all good

2988
01:52:52.08 --> 01:52:54.32
They put it on USA or one of these you know

2989
01:52:55.36 --> 01:52:59.92
Networks they got edit it right edited for television so there's three ways they do it in the movies

2990
01:52:59.92 --> 01:53:04.88
They either just take out the whole scene which is like what they do with books right sometimes like I

2991
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:13.12
Guess they could yeah usually change it. Yes, which did you that movie still in the movie version? Yeah, they have a dubbed voice over for the swearing

2992
01:53:13.52 --> 01:53:17.20
Yeah, and every once in a while you have a movie with an actual different scene

2993
01:53:17.36 --> 01:53:22.32
Yeah, if you watch trading places or something on you have actual different scenes like that they read it

2994
01:53:22.64 --> 01:53:27.44
Then the third is the blackout version and what you did which they just blank it out

2995
01:53:27.44 --> 01:53:31.76
So if they're swearing he'll be like what the and the mouth will show it, but they just won't have the audio

2996
01:53:31.76 --> 01:53:36.16
Right to me that's the best way to do it because it keeps you in the story you're like okay

2997
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:40.16
He's so right there. I get it. You can't swear on tea on this network or whatever

2998
01:53:40.88 --> 01:53:47.28
But in my opinion this the blackout the physical like I just saw it in there it's physically blacked out

2999
01:53:47.84 --> 01:53:50.56
And I highlighted lowlighted. Yeah, if you

3000
01:53:51.12 --> 01:53:53.12
It gives it the mistake

3001
01:53:53.12 --> 01:53:56.96
Kind of like there's something hidden under here. That's class why they can't know

3002
01:53:56.96 --> 01:54:03.60
So classifying yeah, you can't know about you can't even know about it. Yeah, yeah, even even that it's fiction

3003
01:54:03.76 --> 01:54:09.32
Which is even a lot like half level up even from yeah, yeah, like wait a second. They're redacting

3004
01:54:09.92 --> 01:54:11.92
Fiction what is that me

3005
01:54:12.48 --> 01:54:18.52
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and I know that you last when he said like secret because you and I both know what gets redacted

3006
01:54:19.52 --> 01:54:21.52
And it's not really

3007
01:54:21.52 --> 01:54:23.92
I know I built it up too much. Let me talk about it

3008
01:54:23.92 --> 01:54:29.76
It's one of the major was we'll edit this out. Well, it's so well my plan to the first one

3009
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:34.48
I didn't I didn't appeal so you're gonna year to appeal these things and I didn't do it the first ones

3010
01:54:34.48 --> 01:54:36.48
I didn't have enough money

3011
01:54:36.48 --> 01:54:39.28
So second one though. They took a lot more in this second one and

3012
01:54:40.48 --> 01:54:42.08
I'm appealing this one

3013
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:46.80
So and what you do for the appeal is you find the information on government websites

3014
01:54:46.80 --> 01:54:52.08
You can't just go to Wikipedia whatever else but on actual government websites in congressional testimony

3015
01:54:52.08 --> 01:54:55.28
Out there via the government

3016
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:00.40
So repealing this one and almost everything in there except for one little phrase

3017
01:55:01.20 --> 01:55:03.20
We found it on government websites

3018
01:55:03.36 --> 01:55:08.24
So repealing so that if the paper back comes out in this now you can see what the government didn't want you to see

3019
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:11.84
But it's I don't want to build it up too much because it's really

3020
01:55:12.64 --> 01:55:14.64
It's not as cool as it's all

3021
01:55:14.64 --> 01:55:16.64
No, but

3022
01:55:16.64 --> 01:55:21.60
They took out so surprising as I made up so I made up a location because I'd been there

3023
01:55:21.60 --> 01:55:23.60
Yeah, before I came in the one in the military

3024
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:28.56
So I used it as a location in the novel because it made sense where it starts second one is kind of starts in Africa

3025
01:55:28.56 --> 01:55:34.96
And then it goes up here and you know goes into whatever but I'm like that's a big good place for kind of the cave

3026
01:55:35.12 --> 01:55:37.12
Gotta go there change gotta transform and

3027
01:55:37.84 --> 01:55:41.04
So I just made it up because I'd been there. I can describe the rocks. I can describe the mountains

3028
01:55:41.04 --> 01:55:43.92
I can describe the architecture so I put it in there. They blacked it all out

3029
01:55:44.16 --> 01:55:49.92
It's totally made up they blacked it all out but they left in by accident the

3030
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:51.92
The

3031
01:55:51.20 --> 01:55:55.04
The capital of that country. Yeah, so I blacked it out for them

3032
01:55:56.24 --> 01:56:00.56
Knowing in their intent I took it out for them, but they missed that they took out the type of architecture

3033
01:56:00.56 --> 01:56:05.04
They took out the mountains they took out any reference to the country which is so strange

3034
01:56:05.20 --> 01:56:09.36
But they left in by accident the capital and so what that happens right? Yeah

3035
01:56:09.36 --> 01:56:11.36
That's somebody else was up in that cave

3036
01:56:11.36 --> 01:56:13.76
Get yeah, we can't affirmation go it on

3037
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:17.92
Exactly, through this stranger than fiction

3038
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:21.52
Yeah, but that's good. That's another selling point in a way when you can say

3039
01:56:22.08 --> 01:56:27.60
This like I'm revealing in this book what the government didn't want you to go back actually. Yep, exactly

3040
01:56:27.60 --> 01:56:31.92
So the paper back to yep, yeah, obviously how goes cool man well

3041
01:56:32.72 --> 01:56:34.96
One day what did you revisit you did to it? What?

3042
01:56:35.36 --> 01:56:38.64
I think you're doing these hard acts about it. They're heavy's right now. I know I know I

3043
01:56:39.04 --> 01:56:41.04
Dabbled through the years

3044
01:56:41.44 --> 01:56:47.76
But I've essentially what I did open tell 95 that's really my base and I got I'm obviously shoot him

3045
01:56:47.76 --> 01:56:50.96
Well, obviously so I'm shoot all the time staying safe that's sort of thing, but

3046
01:56:51.52 --> 01:56:54.72
The jujitsu is whatever I am right now that is where my

3047
01:56:55.04 --> 01:56:57.68
Markle ground fighting skills are going to remain

3048
01:56:58.40 --> 01:57:00.72
Wait, why are you committing to that right? Yeah

3049
01:57:01.04 --> 01:57:07.36
So what is my surgery to just time wise and knowing where my focus needs to be right now

3050
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:10.16
So what do you think's worse for your spine?

3051
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:12.80
Clean in jerks or

3052
01:57:12.80 --> 01:57:18.96
grappling clean jerks. I would have to agree really. I don't actually think clean jerks are bad for your spine

3053
01:57:18.96 --> 01:57:20.000
I think they're good for your spine

3054
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:21.60
But grappling

3055
01:57:21.60 --> 01:57:27.28
You actually that's see this is the delve into how you get your information for your little books

3056
01:57:27.28 --> 01:57:33.20
Right? Oh yeah, you sent me a text whatever a two years ago. Hey if a guy was in Virginia

3057
01:57:33.20 --> 01:57:35.20
One to train with like the best

3058
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:37.36
On the east coast

3059
01:57:37.36 --> 01:57:41.84
Where were we going train? You help you send me that text. I'm like send the hands

3060
01:57:41.84 --> 01:57:44.96
Okay, sure did you got right back to me. I appreciate it

3061
01:57:45.36 --> 01:57:49.68
And went right in the book. That's these guys just research you've ever done. Oh, it's great

3062
01:57:49.68 --> 01:57:51.20
It's Draco perfect

3063
01:57:51.20 --> 01:57:53.20
Yep, and it made it right in the book and I moved on

3064
01:57:53.44 --> 01:57:56.64
My little bad when people text me and I don't text them back like right away

3065
01:57:57.36 --> 01:58:00.000
Oh really so you must feel real bad with me then

3066
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.36
Yeah, I do the whole right away

3067
01:58:01.36 --> 01:58:06.88
Hey, it's real foreign I mean, but sometimes it just doesn't like get it a lot of texts and like you got us at there and

3068
01:58:06.88 --> 01:58:12.48
You know, but I try and text people back eventually or you might need to hit me with a little follow-up

3069
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:14.48
or you'll follow up

3070
01:58:15.20 --> 01:58:16.80
Well, hey um

3071
01:58:16.80 --> 01:58:21.76
Well doing you just to impeeking at 95 stay in there is better than not picking to do so not

3072
01:58:21.76 --> 01:58:26.80
We're about the kids were in it. Yeah, right away daughter in it from

3073
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Oh, just in the game right now in

3074
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.28
We are

3075
01:58:31.28 --> 01:58:37.60
We're not so now we're in need to talk. Yeah, so she's in the snowboarding now in tennis

3076
01:58:38.08 --> 01:58:43.84
So she turned 13. That's cool. Everything but I think age 11. I'm maybe 12 11. I think she might have stopped

3077
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:46.48
kind of yeah

3078
01:58:46.64 --> 01:58:48.64
It's tough. I was tough

3079
01:58:48.64 --> 01:58:50.64
Is there just to in Park City?

3080
01:58:50.64 --> 01:58:54.16
I know there's full on just to and Utah you got Pedro's sour up there

3081
01:58:54.48 --> 01:58:59.44
You got all kinds of good just to people up in Salt Lake City. Yeah, for sure. Yep. No, we sure do and there's one

3082
01:58:59.44 --> 01:59:03.92
I think Pedro's sour has I think a little offsite in Park City may very lead

3083
01:59:04.32 --> 01:59:06.40
So of course we checked it out before the move

3084
01:59:06.88 --> 01:59:10.64
They've moved sand so I haven't followed where they moved to but I think there's one still there

3085
01:59:11.44 --> 01:59:14.80
But because it was important to me because at the time we moved my daughter was still in it

3086
01:59:14.80 --> 01:59:17.60
Our little guy was in it all right your old now at your old

3087
01:59:18.48 --> 01:59:22.80
So it was important to me that there was due to where we were moving and but now that we moved

3088
01:59:22.80 --> 01:59:26.80
I would get there and it's gone. It's just like an empty space. So I think it's still there somewhere

3089
01:59:26.80 --> 01:59:29.44
But the kids I can't either doing their things unfortunately

3090
01:59:31.44 --> 01:59:35.84
There's a lot to do lots to do up there but we know I dabble over the over the years was still doing it well

3091
01:59:35.84 --> 01:59:40.56
I was an opso or NNX always but before I got out in Coronado because it was right there

3092
01:59:40.56 --> 01:59:42.24
I go at lunch and roll with some guys

3093
01:59:42.48 --> 01:59:48.16
I'll be some researching I think that where we can get you get you and your family back in the game up and so up in Park City

3094
01:59:48.16 --> 01:59:54.16
Because I personally feel like guilty to have your family not training to have you not training

3095
01:59:54.16 --> 01:59:58.16
You're taking some extreme ownership of your car

3096
01:59:58.16 --> 02:00:00.64
You're taking some extreme ownership of that

3097
02:00:00.64 --> 02:00:04.64
Rees needs to get in the game. Yeah, in the story. You know the fictionalized

3098
02:00:05.20 --> 02:00:06.80
James Reese is on it

3099
02:00:06.80 --> 02:00:11.36
Yeah, you said you got a get you know you talk about transferring those emotions right

3100
02:00:11.92 --> 02:00:16.64
Real world. I remember how you never like to get you know just thrown around the mat

3101
02:00:16.96 --> 02:00:20.96
The floor wiped with you know yeah, I was worried that's why didn't tell you I was coming in last night

3102
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.60
I know I said it I didn't I was worried that I'd be up at three something getting just destroyed on the mat

3103
02:00:27.60 --> 02:00:30.88
Here, yeah, we're just in the is out so you know

3104
02:00:30.88 --> 02:00:32.88
That knee is rapidly

3105
02:00:33.28 --> 02:00:37.04
Yeah, approaching yeah, and it's been rapidly for a long time

3106
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:38.32
That's not so

3107
02:00:38.32 --> 02:00:40.72
All good and we're gonna look forward to that so

3108
02:00:41.84 --> 02:00:46.000
Back to you just to when you get back and you just you're gonna need a key or if you're getting them too

3109
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.64
Just for the first time you're gonna need a key dokey no, gee do both that's the best 100%

3110
02:00:51.68 --> 02:00:57.92
See if you're a park city you talk if you get no fighting park city you talk the other person is almost guaranteed to be wearing

3111
02:00:58.72 --> 02:01:00.72
a deep out

3112
02:01:00.72 --> 02:01:03.36
Yeah, that's too long straight up wearing a jacket

3113
02:01:04.16 --> 02:01:06.80
Straight up wearing a North Face

3114
02:01:07.44 --> 02:01:10.72
Parker right just patagonia boom

3115
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:16.40
It's very possible. It was a galipel on a patagonia jacket. Yeah, let's get some of that

3116
02:01:17.68 --> 02:01:24.000
What's the patagonia jacket? It's just a jacket. It's like a parka. There's another had explained to me what a parka was on one podcast

3117
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Wow, yeah, I don't know

3118
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:33.20
Nonetheless sounds nice sounds good similar to a githop good all right?

3119
02:01:33.20 --> 02:01:36.48
We're gonna do gui what kind of gui we're gonna get? Do you know I know

3120
02:01:36.48 --> 02:01:42.80
Orgian or you can get it the better any 100% there's only one best one in the world why would you not get the best one in the world?

3121
02:01:42.80 --> 02:01:49.60
There's no 100% get the best one in the world is it because the best one costs five times more than the not best one?

3122
02:01:49.60 --> 02:01:51.60
No or is it all the same?

3123
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:56.72
No same same cost while you can choose you can grab the the big dillocks

3124
02:01:57.20 --> 02:02:00.000
What do you call what's the word you always do you not always be for you?

Yes, unless you can grab that one if you want good good up to you or jinkies and various

3127
02:02:07.92 --> 02:02:16.16
What do you call like options of keys all made America though by the way speaking of made America you can other clothes made in America

3128
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:18.88

3209
02:08:50.80 --> 02:08:51.44

I think they say like subscribe and no wait yeah something like that. There's some other thing that you're supposed to do

3246

If you're that okay, so anyway, try to YouTube channel. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. So if you want to do those things whatever

3247

And that's where you can get echoes echoes videos that he spends allegedly so much time making

3248
02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:17.92
But once every every four years like the Olympics

3249
02:11:18.32 --> 02:11:22.48
Like the linear Olympics in Park City every four years a good video is gonna come out

3250
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:26.32
Whatever Jack Car like some soap. I do I repost it down on

3251
02:11:26.88 --> 02:11:28.88
Repost it we lie to ourselves

3252
02:11:28.88 --> 02:11:33.28
Oh, there you go see things thanks for that by the way. All right. Also psycho a little warfare

3253
02:11:33.92 --> 02:11:38.000
Go ahead. No, I'm giving it to you. I put your name there psychological warfare

3254
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.72
You don't know what that is. This is what it is an album with tracks

3255
02:11:40.72 --> 02:11:48.08
Jocco chat anyway. He tea on those tracks he tells you how to give through moments of weakness like if you're about to eat the wrong thing

3256
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:53.20
Because for the short term because the short game long game you can't listen to this

3257
02:11:53.44 --> 02:11:57.12
Oh, yeah, and it 100% works by the way. So if you're like okay, I'm gonna

3258
02:11:57.68 --> 02:12:00.64
In life this is what I learned one of the biggest things people ask me this all time

3259
02:12:01.20 --> 02:12:05.76
I would say literally anyone who has questions quote unquote for me. This is one of the questions they'll ask

3260
02:12:05.76 --> 02:12:09.04
What's the biggest thing you learn from jocco? I'll tell you right now. Here it is

3261
02:12:09.04 --> 02:12:11.04
If you look at things

3262
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:16.80
Short term versus long term small picture big picture oh and then there's like another one

3263
02:12:16.80 --> 02:12:23.44
Whatever, but either way, it's all the same thing short term so in psychological warfare if you're going short game if you're gonna start playing the short game for that moment

3264
02:12:23.68 --> 02:12:26.48
This will if you're gonna lose the short game in the moment

3265
02:12:27.04 --> 02:12:31.84
Yes, you're just any if you're gonna if you're gonna take a short term short term have immediate gratification

3266
02:12:31.84 --> 02:12:36.24
But it's a long term down. Yes, exactly right and most of the time not all the time

3267
02:12:36.24 --> 02:12:41.44
But most of the time short term if you play short short game you lose the long game with that play

3268
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:47.84
It's like you take a short term step forward and take a long step back. It's one of those deals usually you can break things down into that

3269
02:12:48.24 --> 02:12:53.76
So this what this does I'm getting that because I need to listen to that one my whole foods and I'm getting up there

3270
02:12:53.76 --> 02:12:56.96
Ready to get to that register and they have those peanut butter cups

3271
02:12:57.52 --> 02:12:59.52

3272
02:12:59.52 --> 02:13:01.52
Natural that's okay

3273
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:08.16

3276
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:22.32

02:13:40.56 --> 02:13:42.56
What does he get at the store?

3282
02:13:42.56 --> 02:13:44.56
Just work

3283
02:13:44.56 --> 02:13:46.56
Oh, he just gets crazy

3284
02:13:46.56 --> 02:13:52.000
You know, so good he'll be like I'm hungry going to the store comes home. What does he come home with?

3285
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Half gallon of whatever ice cream makes sense

3286
02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:00.24
But because you know the supermarket's they they they formulate or they design

3287
02:14:00.56 --> 02:14:05.28
Yeah, store in the product of certain way so like boom boom that's why they put the Reese's pin

3288
02:14:05.28 --> 02:14:09.76
But right at the at the checkout. They call impulse buys right and that goes for everything little

3289
02:14:10.32 --> 02:14:14.80
Machines and balloons and all that is that's their psychological warfare

3290
02:14:14.80 --> 02:14:18.80
That's what it is. It's their psychological warfare. And you got combat that

3291
02:14:18.80 --> 02:14:24.32
Yeah, with psychological warfare. Yeah, but thank you meet the flanking. Oh, I see

3292
02:14:24.32 --> 02:14:28.08
Can I get a boy the aisle freaking away the aisle? Yeah, you can snack

3293
02:14:28.08 --> 02:14:33.76
I'll you're not even gonna be check out but you got to check out and that's where they got them that's your weakness bro

3294
02:14:34.32 --> 02:14:39.12
So good, but that's what your boy is essentially falling for when he goes in

3295
02:14:40.32 --> 02:14:42.72
That's where you're wrong. He's going up there on the

3296
02:14:42.72 --> 02:14:48.000
Yeah, he's going to his land. He's leaving the house and he's thinking the brothers

3297
02:14:48.72 --> 02:14:50.72
Yeah, okay, that's what he's doing

3298
02:14:51.76 --> 02:14:53.76
He goes and gets gays like

3299
02:14:54.48 --> 02:15:01.52
The plan is actually honestly the ice cream thing is really taking a down hit at my house because malt right because everyone just kind of on the malt

3300
02:15:01.52 --> 02:15:03.52
Yeah, but like but

3301
02:15:03.92 --> 02:15:07.92
My son will get straight up chocolate chip cookies just that's what he did last night

3302
02:15:07.92 --> 02:15:12.000
That's why this is fresh in my mind comes home nine o'clock goes the store at eight

3303
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Forty like we already ate dinner

3304
02:15:15.20 --> 02:15:18.64
Okay, where are you going? Oh, it's gonna move the store and he's only thinking about one thing

3305
02:15:18.64 --> 02:15:20.64
He's not thinking about lettuce

3306
02:15:21.36 --> 02:15:28.88
He's been thinking about apples he's thinking chocolate chip cookies coming back with the big chunks in them like the premium

3307
02:15:28.88 --> 02:15:33.04
Yeah, and then the evil little kid brings him into my house

3308
02:15:33.60 --> 02:15:36.88
You know, I mean it's a good way to get shanked actually

3309
02:15:36.88 --> 02:15:41.04
He needs a psychological work. Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah big time

I think that's what no chalk was allowed

3328
02:16:51.60 --> 02:16:53.28
Really, this is what Jim

3329
02:16:53.60 --> 02:16:56.40
Section he talking talk about it. What the whole town numbers is

3330
02:16:56.40 --> 02:17:01.04
It was a drop or Jim. Hey, it was a Jim that had bumper plates. It was a Jim that had

3331
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.32
Six squat racks

3332
02:17:04.32 --> 02:17:10.28
No four squat no six squat racks. I'm in this Jim no chalk if they have bumpers

3333
02:17:10.28 --> 02:17:15.84
They have that's how they're bells no chalk they have pull a bar's no chalk. That's a real problem

3334
02:17:16.40 --> 02:17:20.16
I can see like a you know, hey, if you're a little bit of our fitness

3335
02:17:20.16 --> 02:17:27.20
You got the the universal machines or whatever that goes out there jamming up. Yeah

3336
02:17:28.32 --> 02:17:33.12
Not nothing gets universal by the way, but you know, let's keep it real anyway

3383
02:21:19.60 --> 02:21:25.60
Yeah, we're talking to a leadership slob. Yes, you don't want no you want to be sharp you want to be in tune

3384
02:21:27.12 --> 02:21:33.92
I I experience this because I get to see it all the time with the companies we were like I see someone that's like really in the game and they're

3385
02:21:34.32 --> 02:21:38.16
Sharp yeah, they're their their leadership is sharp and then all of a sudden

3386
02:21:38.80 --> 02:21:41.92
They slack off for a while and they have a leadership problem and they handle it wrong

3387
02:21:42.96 --> 02:21:47.84
Just like they couldn't match they couldn't do 42 pull-ups like they could before now they're doing 32

3388
02:21:47.84 --> 02:21:53.20
Why they haven't been trained got to keep your leadership brain sharp you've been 40 to pull-ups

3389
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:58.24
No like my mine was 30 something was my was my best I think still good man 30 something

3390
02:21:58.24 --> 02:22:02.88
But in high school when I was very very light. I'm a two sets of 20. I still remember that was my thing

3391
02:22:02.88 --> 02:22:05.68
Come on like two sets of two that's what's interesting

3392
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:08.08
That was getting ready for bud essentially that was high school

3393
02:22:08.56 --> 02:22:13.92
But so I still had a little time. Yeah, I was still trying what I was gonna say is like for me getting ready for buds

3394
02:22:13.92 --> 02:22:18.16
Was I was like bro, I did I did three sets of pull-ups today because we didn't know

3395
02:22:18.16 --> 02:22:21.84
I think I didn't need to do 250 pull-ups for work out

3396
02:22:22.40 --> 02:22:26.72
350 pull-ups work out. I didn't think of that it didn't even make sense to me right it was 19

3397
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:33.04
It was 1989 1990 well it was there was no way to access this information

3398
02:22:33.28 --> 02:22:37.12
No, so you're not going to be doing the same number of pull-ups as your class number. Yeah

3399
02:22:37.68 --> 02:22:40.72
Yeah, how many that's what we're gonna do yeah, by the way

3434
02:25:17.96 --> 02:25:24.40
Thanks, brother. Appreciate it to anyone else that's listening that is serving right now or has served

3435
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
thanks to you for keeping us free

3436
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
and

3437
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:38.60
To police and to law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service

3438
02:25:38.60 --> 02:25:42.28
and all the first responders that are out there 24 hours a day and

3439
02:25:43.12 --> 02:25:46.32
They're training and they're preparing and they're on call

3440
02:25:47.20 --> 02:25:52.68
So that we can be safe here at home thanks to all of you for that service and for that sacrifice

3441
02:25:54.04 --> 02:25:56.04
into everyone else that is

3442
02:25:56.04 --> 02:25:58.04
listening

3443
02:26:00.04 --> 02:26:02.04
Remember that

3444
02:26:02.04 --> 02:26:05.04
There's always somebody out there with their sights on you

3445
02:26:06.92 --> 02:26:12.12
And maybe it's a competitor in business. Maybe it's an enemy in surgeon

3446
02:26:12.12 --> 02:26:19.24
Maybe it's some criminal fog maybe it's someone that's just looking to do harm to you or your family

3447
02:26:20.68 --> 02:26:22.68
Or maybe

3448
02:26:22.68 --> 02:26:25.56
Maybe that someone is you and

3449
02:26:26.76 --> 02:26:28.76
Maybe your your own worst enemy

3450
02:26:30.60 --> 02:26:37.68
Slighting into the depths of complacency allowing yourself to wander down the easy path

3451
02:26:40.80 --> 02:26:42.80
Say no to that

3452
02:26:44.24 --> 02:26:46.24
Remember why you're here remember

3453
02:26:46.84 --> 02:26:49.96
what you want to do remember your cause

3454
02:26:49.96 --> 02:26:56.56
Be a true believer and then live that belief

3455
02:26:58.48 --> 02:27:01.12
By getting up every day

3456
02:27:02.44 --> 02:27:04.44
Then getting after it

3457
02:27:04.44 --> 02:27:29.000
And until next time this is Jack car and echo and jacco out
