00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.02 This is Jockel podcast number 299 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink good evening. I come good evening
00:00:09.22 --> 00:00:11.22 So there is a video
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.08 And it's it's out there in the world on YouTube or whatever you can find it and it's it's a video of the Battle of Ramadi
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:28.76 2006 in the summertime and there's this big firefight going on and
00:00:30.56 --> 00:00:35.44 You can tell it's pretty intense. There's machine gun fire a bunch of people
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:41.20 Putting rounds down range people are yelling and barking out orders and passing information
00:00:41.20 --> 00:00:47.52 And you can kind of put together that they're working to get a bomb dropped from air support on
00:00:47.52 --> 00:00:54.20 On a vehicle that the insurgents had been utilizing and fighting from and
00:00:57.36 --> 00:01:00.36 They they get the bomb run and
00:01:00.98 --> 00:01:06.06 Right as the right as the bomb is about to hit there's a low in the gunfire because guys are taking cover
00:01:06.78 --> 00:01:09.02 You know as that bomb is gonna hit and
00:01:09.02 --> 00:01:15.46 And then so there's a low in the fire and then the bomb hits
00:01:17.46 --> 00:01:20.62 And there is a massive explosion and
00:01:21.50 --> 00:01:24.34 You hear a lack of couple hoots and then you hear this
00:01:25.70 --> 00:01:28.30 You hear this bellowing laughter
00:01:28.98 --> 00:01:36.02 From one person and you can tell the laughter sort of it's some surprise it's some excitement
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:42.50 It's some level of relief and some it's also just some twisted dark military humor
00:01:44.18 --> 00:01:46.18 That's making this person
00:01:47.02 --> 00:01:49.66 Bellow out with this laughter and I
00:01:52.34 --> 00:01:54.34 Watch that video sometimes
00:01:55.74 --> 00:02:00.86 And I listen to that video sometimes not for the firefighter not for the bomb drop
00:02:00.86 --> 00:02:04.14 But to hear that laugh
00:02:07.06 --> 00:02:08.98 That laugh is coming from Seth Stone
00:02:11.50 --> 00:02:13.50 And you don't see him on camera
00:02:14.38 --> 00:02:19.06 But if you knew Seth then that laugh is unmistakable
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:24.06 And that's what I like to hear
00:02:26.54 --> 00:02:28.54 And that's reflective of life
00:02:28.54 --> 00:02:30.54 Because Seth was
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:38.34 He was tough and he was brave and he was smart and he was creative and he was a combat leader
00:02:41.54 --> 00:02:44.54 But above all those characteristics
00:02:46.34 --> 00:02:49.04 But I like to remember most about him now
00:02:51.18 --> 00:02:52.68 Now that he's gone is his laugh
00:02:52.68 --> 00:02:54.68 laugh
00:02:57.48 --> 00:03:02.80 Then humor is a blessing and laughter is an anodotepane and
00:03:03.60 --> 00:03:08.44 suffering and anguish and sometimes it's the only relief for those things
00:03:13.96 --> 00:03:18.24 I have another friend who wants to hold me everybody's got their Vietnam
00:03:18.24 --> 00:03:20.24 um
00:03:21.44 --> 00:03:25.80 And in this particular case he was talking about the fact that his first girlfriend when he was a kid
00:03:26.76 --> 00:03:31.70 Was older than him and was bigger than him and she would just pick him up and
00:03:32.32 --> 00:03:37.56 Kiss him against his will and it wasn't anything he could do about it and so he just had to deal with it
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 He just had to get through it
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:43.28 Everybody's got their Vietnam
00:03:44.28 --> 00:03:46.28 Tell me
00:03:46.28 --> 00:03:52.48 And he wasn't in Vietnam, no is he even a veteran, but he was just adding humor
00:03:54.32 --> 00:03:56.32 to life
00:03:57.48 --> 00:03:59.48 But there is some truth to that statement
00:04:00.60 --> 00:04:02.60 Everybody struggles in life
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:08.08 And those struggles very some struggles we face are imposed on us by the world
00:04:09.08 --> 00:04:12.84 Some struggles we face are imposed on us by ourselves
00:04:12.84 --> 00:04:19.92 They also vary in intensity and consequence and depending on who you are
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.44 When it's your problem when it's your struggle, that's the world
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:33.76 And as was with Seth one of the best ways to overcome struggle is humor comedy
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:40.56 And that same friend of mine certainly has used humor to get through his life
00:04:42.76 --> 00:04:48.12 Let's get through some of his struggles and some of those struggles more severe than just getting kissed by a seventh grader
00:04:48.12 --> 00:04:53.48 his name is Theo Vaughn and he's here with us tonight to share some of his struggles
00:04:55.92 --> 00:04:57.92 And some of the lessons he's learned
00:04:57.92 --> 00:05:05.64 and making everyone laugh as a comedian in order to overcome those struggles that we all face
00:05:06.20 --> 00:05:07.84 Theo, Theo Vaughn

00:06:09.44 --> 00:06:13.84 So numbers they're on the inside of us and so numbers are on the outside. Yes, I was
00:06:14.60 --> 00:06:19.80 One of my kids came home and this was I was telling the Navy at the time and I came home and there was like
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:24.80 Wars going on and there was something happened overseas and I was trying to contend with how we're gonna get
00:06:25.20 --> 00:06:29.52 Guys prepared for this combat situation and I came home one time and
00:06:29.84 --> 00:06:33.92 You know one of my kids complained about something and it was some kind of real struggle
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:38.000 I forget what it was but I remember I first I was kind of like what you get in me
00:06:38.28 --> 00:06:40.28 We're at war
00:06:40.28 --> 00:06:45.08 I would say those words. I was able to keep us self-incheck, but what I realized was
00:06:45.08 --> 00:06:50.24 Whatever you're doing in life, that's that's that's the that's your world, right?
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:55.48 And so when that world gets tough and you don't know anything else man that that struggled that is your Vietnam
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:00.76 Yeah, and that's where people end up whether it's you know some girl kissing on you when you're
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:02.12 Whatever
00:07:02.12 --> 00:07:08.36 I'm gonna do well the tough part was other people were walked like the bigger bull with like my brother and his friends
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:13.48 The bus would pick them up first and so then it would come and get me and so that's when she would pick me up
00:07:13.48 --> 00:07:19.24 And it was like my first girlfriend so I was also like excited kind of a habit
00:07:19.24 --> 00:07:22.60 But I always kind of embarrassed honestly to have her like in front of I didn't want every
00:07:22.60 --> 00:07:25.96 I was just kind of she was just tougher than me, you know
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:28.20 He played I think baseball
00:07:28.36 --> 00:07:32.44 You know and she could have played softball right right so she just opted
00:07:32.60 --> 00:07:35.24 Yeah, I mean she was doing that you know
00:07:35.96 --> 00:07:40.88 So yeah, it didn't even have that back then so let's get let's get into for those people
00:07:40.88 --> 00:07:44.000 A lot of people don't know who you are I guess that might listen to this podcast
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.20 I know you're really famous as a comedian right?
00:07:47.20 --> 00:07:51.84 Yeah, that's the deal. Yeah, I've done what the well is a comedian man and so I'm grateful to have that

00:07:59.04 --> 00:08:02.000 Louisiana I was born in Louisiana and
00:08:03.20 --> 00:08:05.20 Coming to Louisiana so
00:08:05.84 --> 00:08:09.76 Not a real pot. I mean it's a good place. We have tall a statue of Ronald Reagan
00:08:09.76 --> 00:08:11.76 That's cool and
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000 He's never seen it, but we got
00:08:15.20 --> 00:08:18.000 So it was ever like what's the connection with the comedy?
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.44 Copper too. So like homeless dudes are always trying to like get in there and ship his thumbs off and you know
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:25.92 Get the reimbursement, but
00:08:26.08 --> 00:08:28.56 Why did why Reagan he
00:08:28.80 --> 00:08:34.24 Connected to that town at all they just somebody dug him somebody that had enough copper and joy them and I think donated to the city
00:08:34.24 --> 00:08:40.32 To be honest. No your dad was like a older gentleman when you were born. Oh, yeah
00:08:40.88 --> 00:08:44.24 Yeah, my dad was 70 years old my dad was born in 1910 and
00:08:45.76 --> 00:08:48.56 And he was from Nicaragua and he was
00:08:49.60 --> 00:08:51.68 So he was a senior citizen when I met him, you know
00:08:52.88 --> 00:08:55.76 So and he was from Nicaragua. Yeah, now I
00:08:56.56 --> 00:09:01.20 I saw that he was from bluefield Nicaragua. Yeah, he's from bluefield. I never been there
00:09:01.20 --> 00:09:06.24 But I heard a lot of I've heard it's a tough place to be sometimes because of their politics, but I heard it's really nice
00:09:06.24 --> 00:09:11.68 I heard that and I don't know what what's so what's your dad's like background? Was he from there?
00:09:11.68 --> 00:09:16.80 Because I guess this place was kind of settled by European pirates. Have you heard this?
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.96 Yeah, I don't know my dad was doing as younger. I don't remember seeing any other pictures of him
00:09:20.96 --> 00:09:22.64 So I don't know I patches
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:29.28 Yeah, I never seen him, you know hanging out with a parrot. I've never seen any of his you know past work
00:09:29.28 --> 00:09:37.68 When I knew him it was you know, it was just a lot of stories and there was more like the stories by the time I met him and stories, you know
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:43.36 They they get barnacles on him over time. They gain traction. They get tread. They get
00:09:43.92 --> 00:09:49.52 They take different avenues and so by the time I knew him it was more I was kind of left with the
00:09:50.48 --> 00:09:53.76 You know just the stories, you know the refined stories, you know
00:09:55.20 --> 00:09:56.88 What do you how do you end up in America?
00:09:56.88 --> 00:09:58.88 I don't know man
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:05.12 I really don't know him and those are things I wish that I had been able to know better and I think those are things
00:10:05.12 --> 00:10:10.96 We're synonymous like from me anyway where I feel disconnection sometimes is not haven't had that you know
00:10:10.96 --> 00:10:13.84 There's some of those types of conversations when I was old enough to kind of care
00:10:15.92 --> 00:10:21.52 Yeah, when I was like what once I got a like 12 or 13 I kind of I was like
00:10:21.52 --> 00:10:29.36 I mean it was kind of embarrassing you know having such an older time my dad would fall he'd be a sleep at like a vent he would fall asleep at the
00:10:30.48 --> 00:10:33.04 Carpool when he'd come pick us up he'd fall asleep and so
00:10:33.68 --> 00:10:41.28 The lady had to go wake him up. It was always like so much extra stuff that you don't think you have to do as a kid just a lot of like
00:10:42.08 --> 00:10:44.08 You know
00:10:44.08 --> 00:10:47.36 So but yeah, he was cool though, man. It was also interesting
00:10:47.36 --> 00:10:51.52 You know he knew a lot of people that are about to die everybody introduced who knew about to die
00:10:53.04 --> 00:10:58.32 What was the deal with your mom? I mean he must have been some kind of a you know he must have had some
00:10:58.96 --> 00:11:05.12 Cool characteristics because how old was your mom? My mom was 32 when I was born and he didn't have any money
00:11:05.92 --> 00:11:08.56 So I don't know who would bang an old dude with no
00:11:08.56 --> 00:11:11.52 My bro that's insane that is pioneer
00:11:11.52 --> 00:11:22.16 I know what woman that would I mean that is a pioneer woman. What was talking about a pioneer woman was he a woman
00:11:22.16 --> 00:11:24.32 Wah or something was he super like I
00:11:25.04 --> 00:11:28.80 Had a comb I remember that he kept in his pocket maybe it was
00:11:30.16 --> 00:11:35.20 Yeah, a nice one of those small cones man used to keep and they still keep up in cube a lot of time
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:37.84 You see a lot of Cuban men still get that small comb on
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:43.44 Mm-hmm, and you think that might have been the critical factor for for your mom looking at him thinking damn look at that comb
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:47.04 I think in a small town, you know, it's just that something like that can stand out
00:11:47.76 --> 00:11:53.52 Was your mom from Covington, Louisiana too? She's from Illinois, so she just real hard working lady
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.24 You know my mother really likes to work hard and she's
00:11:57.28 --> 00:12:01.12 Delivered newspapers and stuff when I was a kid and delivered all type of stuff
00:12:01.12 --> 00:12:08.72 Um, oh she used to deliver cookies for a little offer some company dude and I go laying her car at night and just lay on to on the box
00:12:08.72 --> 00:12:13.60 And just eat the bitches right just just imagine being the bonuses big is the box
00:12:13.60 --> 00:12:17.20 You're just laying on and you're opening up and that's my Vietnam
00:12:17.20 --> 00:12:21.12 You're in the dark you're trying to be quiet dude and sometimes they would tape a max treat
00:12:21.12 --> 00:12:23.12 You know you're like I'm gonna be all right
00:12:23.68 --> 00:12:27.76 And you just for you get in and you just has many cookies as you could have
00:12:27.76 --> 00:12:35.44 You're laying on your mouse laying an open on a like chocolate chip cookies. No, these are remember the ones they had were kind of
00:12:36.72 --> 00:12:39.36 a hard kind of yellow cookie with a bit of
00:12:40.16 --> 00:12:44.96 Kind of this granulated sugar kind of square look like glitter on the top. Yeah, let's start bread on
00:12:45.52 --> 00:12:47.20 I don't know
00:12:47.20 --> 00:12:52.88 I was excited about your story like I got your picture that but I just don't feel like char I'd feel like
00:12:52.88 --> 00:12:59.44 Cookies there's chocolate chip cookies and then everything else is kind of just not in the same ballpark
00:13:03.84 --> 00:13:07.04 I don't know if I'd agree with that sir. I don't know if I don't have to agree on everything
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:10.48 I'm just giving you my perspective. Yeah, no, and I appreciate you giving it to me, man
00:13:11.36 --> 00:13:13.36 And I would probably
00:13:13.68 --> 00:13:16.72 I'd watch you in a tough kid chocolate chip cookie at thing, you know
00:13:17.36 --> 00:13:20.08 I'd watch I want to be fun to watch you eat, you know
00:13:20.08 --> 00:13:26.80 I don't know a man go all that way pretty fun. I mean like man go, huh? I'll be enough then now let me get better for us
00:13:27.04 --> 00:13:34.64 No, I in fact I don't really I've like I grew up my my we didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up and so we ate a lot of hand burgers
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:37.04 Right like in the morning I would have
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:42.08 Handburger on an English muffin. Oh, you want to have handburger on bread and then for dinner
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:45.92 I have handburger on a bun so you get no all meals could be burgers
00:13:45.92 --> 00:13:52.64 That's what but I didn't really I didn't even like steak until I was maybe like 22 or 23
00:13:53.12 --> 00:14:00.08 Oh, yeah, yeah, because you just it didn't taste good to me. I mean, I would think why not just grind this thing up and put it on it put it into a patty
00:14:00.64 --> 00:14:01.92 Yeah, but you can't you
00:14:02.96 --> 00:14:09.60 So I don't know maybe it's funny to watch me eat a burger on a muffin for breakfast. Yeah, I could see I think that would be unique show
00:14:09.60 --> 00:14:12.80 Watching strong man eat stuff. That's a little bit more dainty
00:14:12.80 --> 00:14:17.04 You know, maybe have a patty for some kind of a unique a
00:14:17.20 --> 00:14:20.40 Electable you know kind of a cookie from another country or something
00:14:21.12 --> 00:14:27.68 I could see that you can't even manage it with your fingers. You know, it's almost like a grenade almost to regular guy
00:14:28.40 --> 00:14:29.76 You know
00:14:29.76 --> 00:14:31.76 Did your mom and dad stay together?
00:14:32.72 --> 00:14:36.24 They stayed together for a while man they had four children and and
00:14:36.24 --> 00:14:40.24 And and
00:14:40.24 --> 00:14:44.96 Then I don't know what happened. I don't know what happened and that's kind of when I started to come like mentally
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:51.20 You know aware of my world and yeah at that point my dad was older he didn't live with us and then
00:14:53.60 --> 00:15:00.32 Yeah, we just had four children in my mom was working a lot and that's where we were three mom basically ended up as a single mom. Yes, you know, was a single mom and
00:15:02.08 --> 00:15:04.08 Yeah, and I don't know
00:15:04.08 --> 00:15:09.76 I you were almost I don't know what you would expect kind of having a child or children with the older man
00:15:10.40 --> 00:15:12.80 You know what kind of expectations you might have
00:15:14.48 --> 00:15:18.40 But but I don't know you know, I don't know what kind of comfort she needed in a world
00:15:18.40 --> 00:15:22.08 Maybe she'd needed to have a family. I don't know what she needed at that time
00:15:22.80 --> 00:15:29.36 But yeah, and so they had the head children and then my dad was kind of gone and then I got a little a shame to my
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:33.20 I got embarrassed a little bit. I was just at that age. I think we're children get
00:15:35.44 --> 00:15:40.16 Were there if they're not like other children if the anything's out of the norm the night feel
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:46.64 Like something's wrong with them or they feel just embarrassed. I'm sure you see what your children did was a time were they getting embarrassed?
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:51.92 Yeah, it doesn't I don't think it matters if you're uh, you know like Tom Brady your kids are gonna be embarrassed
00:15:51.92 --> 00:15:57.12 Right or like doing the rock Johnson your kids will be like oh here comes the big 80
00:15:57.12 --> 00:15:59.12 It gets like I don't think the matters when you are
00:15:59.44 --> 00:16:04.40 It's gonna be your kids are gonna go through an age period where they're embarrassed by you. Yeah, and then
00:16:04.56 --> 00:16:10.72 You got to kind of like just work through it. I guess and hopefully come out the other side and they realize oh, you know
00:16:10.72 --> 00:16:12.32 That's not too bad
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:17.76 But I guess the weird thing you said you like your mom's expectations. I mean the fact that matter is
00:16:18.48 --> 00:16:21.92 He's 70 you're born. I mean expectations are
00:16:21.92 --> 00:16:29.36 They're not even expectations facts are he ain't gonna be around all of that much longer. Right. You know
00:16:29.36 --> 00:16:31.36 Yeah, she's been at a time offer. Yeah
00:16:31.76 --> 00:16:37.76 That's limited time. That's got an expiration date on so she signed up for because she kind of signed up for
00:16:38.24 --> 00:16:40.24 that activity. Yeah
00:16:40.48 --> 00:16:48.96 Yeah, and I think and and I think when sometimes I it's hard to not hold that anx when I look at my life in places that were uncomfortable for me as a child like
00:16:48.96 --> 00:16:52.88 Um, and I'm not complaining. I'm just trying to share some of you know share what
00:16:53.52 --> 00:16:55.52 Some of that was like from me, but um
00:16:56.08 --> 00:16:58.08 Yeah, I think it was Tyler it's like uh
00:16:58.88 --> 00:17:05.44 You felt like you weren't part of a plan like nobody planned or if you were it was a plan that was
00:17:06.72 --> 00:17:10.48 Destined to fail, you know what I'm saying it so then that almost makes you feel like
00:17:11.28 --> 00:17:14.64 What's going on if my commander and chief here my mother or something
00:17:14.64 --> 00:17:19.12 Set me up in this plan that doesn't seem like it has
00:17:20.08 --> 00:17:26.96 Statistically this doesn't seem super smart. No, no, now how old were you when you started having thoughts like that?
00:17:28.08 --> 00:17:34.000 I was it's you know that those are kind of thoughts when I was a kid like I was just thinking you know
00:17:34.48 --> 00:17:38.16 Machine gun throwing rocks uh you know taking apart
00:17:38.80 --> 00:17:42.08 Peep pieces of furniture. Yeah, I mean just talking ignorance stuff
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:45.76 Yeah, and it seems like you're sitting here thinking about the grand scheme and all these plans
00:17:45.76 --> 00:17:48.08 I count how old were you and you started going down that road?
00:17:48.08 --> 00:17:54.08 I don't think I was old. I think I was older when I when I started realizing that stuff. Okay, so this is like looking back. Yeah, a lot of
00:17:54.08 --> 00:17:56.08 That's looking back um
00:17:56.32 --> 00:18:00.72 But I think at the time I'm dealing with the ramifications of some of that without knowing it
00:18:01.28 --> 00:18:03.28 Without always wondering well what
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:06.96 Why do I feel certain ways or why do I behave certain ways?
00:18:06.96 --> 00:18:13.36 So like a subconscious. That's probably just that probably just a subconscious feeling of man
00:18:13.60 --> 00:18:17.92 This doesn't seem like this is gonna even as a little kid you're like man. We're eating ramen again
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000 Right who came up with this plan
00:18:20.40 --> 00:18:23.68 Right. Yeah, there's just no plant like moms work and there's no
00:18:24.40 --> 00:18:27.04 Dad so old so you start to get concerned
00:18:27.84 --> 00:18:34.16 For your dad's health and you have this weird uncomfortable thing where you're supposed to be kind of a child and be free to just
00:18:34.16 --> 00:18:41.20 Not have any worries, but you have these weird extra worries of like you know your dad is getting older you know and so
00:18:41.84 --> 00:18:43.84 I'm or being like eight years old
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:48.32 I'm walking to church it to what my dad we had to church a few blocks away and
00:18:50.08 --> 00:18:51.84 He would ask me what the
00:18:52.08 --> 00:18:55.60 Where he could walk and stuff because of the sidewalks in Louisiana
00:18:56.40 --> 00:19:00.24 The the roots come up through them just like kneecaps just like you know
00:19:00.24 --> 00:19:05.92 You got a thousand long leg at man buried right there under the sidewalk, you know and some of them's you know
00:19:06.88 --> 00:19:09.96 You know they just it just real femury along those
00:19:09.96 --> 00:19:12.000 You know the sidewalks will do it down
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:14.88 They'll be in a damn trapezoid or some half of it
00:19:14.88 --> 00:19:18.32 Did you take this high walk? I don't think you can take you more time to get where you're going
00:19:18.32 --> 00:19:22.000 You know I am the street is month the sidewalks like the Oregon trail
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.44 Well, there's natives under part of it. I mean it gets real dicey
00:19:25.44 --> 00:19:30.64 So I remember walking my dad and he's like can I walk here and stuff like that?
00:19:30.64 --> 00:19:33.60 So then you're I remember getting in this weird space of like
00:19:35.60 --> 00:19:38.88 Just hyper concern and awareness
00:19:39.36 --> 00:19:41.36 That's what I think it was awareness
00:19:41.84 --> 00:19:43.84 So then I had a lot of awareness
00:19:43.84 --> 00:19:46.88 So did that lead to you said behaviors?
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:53.52 What kind of behaviors do you think that this is a situation where you where you act and get in trouble in school
00:19:53.52 --> 00:20:00.16 Where you you know turn it into the delinquent kid where you trying to work real hard to make sure you always had money
00:20:00.16 --> 00:20:02.80 I mean what what how did you react to this situation?
00:20:04.56 --> 00:20:09.04 Well, I think looking back on it and it's interesting because in my life right now
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:12.64 I've been doing a lot of work on this kind of stuff specifically like trying to just
00:20:13.84 --> 00:20:21.36 Just get enough comfort in the sediment or those sedimentary layers those real like just those deep layers
00:20:21.36 --> 00:20:26.88 It's hard for me to plant roots. I notice in my adult life and I think it's because something is the soils just
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:31.60 It's just not enough room in that soil from when I was a when I was younger
00:20:33.60 --> 00:20:38.08 And I wouldn't care if I was able to plant things in my life that would would be able to grow effectively
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:40.56 But I've had trouble doing that like relationships
00:20:41.04 --> 00:20:42.56 Commitment to things
00:20:42.56 --> 00:20:46.000 Wanting to start like a family or have a relationship but struggle with it
00:20:46.88 --> 00:20:48.40 So
00:20:48.40 --> 00:20:53.12 Sorry this isn't very funny dude. I feel bad guys, you know the one day. I mean everybody on your show
00:20:53.68 --> 00:20:56.32 Somebody dying or you know somebody got
00:20:56.56 --> 00:21:00.88 Naded out and then I'm so succumbed and I believe that I'm sitting here
00:21:00.88 --> 00:21:07.44 I don't think there's no one really that tuned into my podcast that's expecting or anticipating or it's gonna be let down if they're not
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.04 You know, we're
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:11.44 If there's not levity in the situation it's okay
00:21:11.44 --> 00:21:19.76 You don't have to be funny here you can just talk about just mayhem and death as far as I'm concerned it will still be good to go. Okay, okay, okay
00:21:19.76 --> 00:21:21.76 good yeah, I think so
00:21:22.56 --> 00:21:26.72 One of the things that I would know that I noticed now looking back is that I didn't
00:21:27.36 --> 00:21:33.12 Whenever I realized that that was my life situation that my dad was real older and that my mom was working all the time
00:21:35.12 --> 00:21:39.04 I didn't believe that the world was a comfortable place for me
00:21:39.04 --> 00:21:41.04 So as a real young kid I just
00:21:41.68 --> 00:21:46.40 There was enough elements in the atmosphere where I just made that choice has a
00:21:46.80 --> 00:21:49.44 My spirit made the choice whatever it is something inside of me
00:21:49.76 --> 00:21:52.24 It wasn't a choice I made like I would make a choice now
00:21:53.20 --> 00:21:56.72 It's like I don't trust the world to be a safe place for me
00:21:57.92 --> 00:21:59.20 So
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:03.36 Whatever brought me into this world whatever the elements are these are not trustworthy elements
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:11.12 And not that I would treat them on trust or not that I'd be mean to them but just in my spirit knows that you have to take care of yourself
00:22:11.12 --> 00:22:15.36 So then you start to try and manage everything yourself
00:22:17.20 --> 00:22:19.52 So I was always really concerned with
00:22:20.88 --> 00:22:27.76 The only thing I had left in like people would look at me, you know what the bus dropped me off like in the poor neighborhood and my dad was so old
00:22:27.76 --> 00:22:33.12 My mom was always gone working. She wasn't like a mom some of the other kids had so
00:22:35.04 --> 00:22:37.04 So the only thing I could control was me
00:22:37.84 --> 00:22:44.000 How you saw me that was it the only piece of my image I had was what you saw of me so
00:22:44.96 --> 00:22:48.56 I would like bike to school so I didn't have to get off the poor bus. I would like
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:52.56 But friend certain kids so you thought I was in a certain group
00:22:52.56 --> 00:23:00.16 I just I was hyper concerned with the kind of image management because it's all I had left
00:23:00.16 --> 00:23:05.60 You know I wouldn't I'm trying to be seen around my family. I kind of because I just didn't want
00:23:07.44 --> 00:23:12.08 I don't know I was just hyper concerned with the only thing that I had that I still I controlled over was
00:23:13.84 --> 00:23:15.52 My own
00:23:15.52 --> 00:23:20.88 Really and this is something yeah, it makes sense, but it's like this is something that you're realizing
00:23:20.88 --> 00:23:26.80 Reflectively looking back like at the time you were like you weren't constantly saying oh I'm I'm in Paris
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:28.40 So I'm gonna do this you were just like man
00:23:28.40 --> 00:23:31.28 I don't really want to get on that bus or get off that bus
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:37.28 I'm just gonna bike to school that seems like a smart thing to do right I think but I start to had I had so much awareness
00:23:37.28 --> 00:23:39.92 I think I just so aware all ways and so then
00:23:42.32 --> 00:23:46.96 You know, I just I think I was making choices that I didn't want people to see me a certain way how I'm
00:23:46.96 --> 00:23:51.84 I'm gonna be so then I got stuck in this how can I manage what people think of me?
00:23:53.04 --> 00:24:00.24 So was the was the was the image that you wanted to project because you could see there's plenty of people that there in those kind of
00:24:00.32 --> 00:24:02.32 Rough situations and there
00:24:02.32 --> 00:24:05.60 You know some people go all right. I'm gonna get straight A's and I'm gonna go to good college
00:24:05.60 --> 00:24:09.12 I'm gonna do all this other stuff or some people are well. I'm gonna become
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.64 You know, I'm gonna become a the toughest delinquent that there can be and people are gonna be scared of me
00:24:14.64 --> 00:24:17.52 So you know you get some going towards like big gang life or whatever
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:22.56 What was it that you were kind of moving towards were you in athlete we plan sports?
00:24:23.12 --> 00:24:26.48 Yeah, we play some decent sports in our neighborhood dude and it was real dicey bro
00:24:26.48 --> 00:24:27.92 We had a lot of people man
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:32.96 We had one dude who would sneak my weed pipe football and he bring matches with him and burn you while he was doing defense
00:24:33.92 --> 00:24:38.72 Bro, and that's crazy when you're thinking okay, who's guard me? You know Thomas this kid Thomas though
00:24:38.72 --> 00:24:42.72 And he's just matching you down where you know if you're not making cuts real hard
00:24:42.72 --> 00:24:49.28 So just some shit like that man we played in this one field that had a big hole right in the middle of it
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:52.80 They're not to the middle but off off to the side with this church football field man and
00:24:53.76 --> 00:24:56.16 Damn people would go missing in that bitch
00:24:56.16 --> 00:25:02.40 So you know I mean this is a couple they had a family of 11 that I swear to God after a long game was a family attend
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:05.52 They lost somebody in their little Jennifer or somebody
00:25:05.92 --> 00:25:07.92 But I remember they did I remember
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:16.32 They would make girls they would put them on the football field playing football just in the neighborhood spray paint a number on his one kids back
00:25:17.36 --> 00:25:20.64 Just all kind of shit man fun stuff that looking back
00:25:21.20 --> 00:25:27.20 What about organized sports in high school? Did you play basketball when I was 11? I got into that when I was 11
00:25:27.20 --> 00:25:36.64 So yeah, I think one thing we just were around our neighborhood a lot we get we get home from school and we would just be up to our own devices, you know
00:25:38.08 --> 00:25:45.20 But one thing I started to notice was like I didn't I had a real untrustworthy relationship with the world
00:25:45.20 --> 00:25:51.60 So I was always worried about I think what people were thinking of me and I felt like people didn't like me
00:25:51.60 --> 00:26:01.60 I felt like I think because sometimes I don't know if I was just such an uncomfortable kid sometimes that I
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.72 Needed laughter so I always felt like if you were laughing you couldn't dislike me at a laugh at the same moment
00:26:09.60 --> 00:26:14.80 Like at that moment like it was down to that moment like when you were done laughing
00:26:16.08 --> 00:26:19.20 I didn't know what you thought of me, you know, and it was kind of scary because
00:26:19.20 --> 00:26:24.40 I think I didn't think much of myself and so the only
00:26:25.76 --> 00:26:32.24 Way I had to feel about myself from moments a moment was how other people felt about you know if I'm real honest and so
00:26:35.12 --> 00:26:38.72 So I think that's why I needed laughter because it was like oh man if I can get
00:26:38.72 --> 00:26:48.08 It was the only thing I trusted is that there's no way somebody could be laughing and I can see them laughing and having joy and
00:26:50.80 --> 00:26:54.96 And hate me at the same time, you know, it was just so that was like
00:26:56.48 --> 00:27:03.44 That was the only equation that made that to me was undeniable and I think that's
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:10.000 And I was a high-per sensitive kid, you know other people aren't as sensitive and so they're able, you know, they can
00:27:10.24 --> 00:27:13.04 Manage things better. I was high-per sensitive, you know
00:27:14.24 --> 00:27:16.88 So I'm really grateful that God gave me
00:27:18.88 --> 00:27:22.08 Whatever I needed to be able to find humor, you know
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:26.16 Because it was other kids in my neighborhood and in the environment that
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:31.12 That in my family didn't get that and so it's
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:38.80 And I'm trying to get any self-pity. I'm just trying to share what I'm thinking and feeling at the same time, you know
00:27:39.84 --> 00:27:44.08 And a lot of this is stuff I've been working through recently like in the past few weeks pretty heavily
00:27:44.48 --> 00:27:47.28 And so a lot of it's real fresh on my brain as well
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:48.72 You know
00:27:48.72 --> 00:27:54.48 Yeah, well, it's scary about well not scary. I from your perspective is the minute someone stops laughing
00:27:54.48 --> 00:27:59.68 You just want to try and make a laugh again so you can get that get that good feeling back
00:27:59.68 --> 00:28:06.40 You know what's that safe feeling? I just need to it's like man, this is a place where I feel okay if they're laughing, you know
00:28:07.52 --> 00:28:13.20 So yeah, so I think and I wasn't like a goofy dude. I wouldn't like farting and a pudding or anything like that
00:28:13.20 --> 00:28:16.72 You know saying I wouldn't some you know booty creep or something
00:28:17.60 --> 00:28:22.88 I just like saying things and and I was real aware so I would see things kind of going on
00:28:23.76 --> 00:28:25.44 I think I was real aware and so
00:28:25.44 --> 00:28:33.12 So it was fun to be able to get people to laugh at moments where you didn't think they were and then you start managing laughter because
00:28:33.92 --> 00:28:36.40 laughter becomes your main
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.32 Tool that you have to feel okay and so
00:28:41.68 --> 00:28:46.08 Then you start using laughter almost like you're calling plays and stuff and you have these little
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:52.000 Those are my weapons, you know that was my knives that was my fist seat, you know I wasn't
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.80 I didn't have a lot of physical confidence so
00:28:55.76 --> 00:28:59.44 So laughter was it really for me that was my biceps, you know
00:29:00.96 --> 00:29:09.52 It seems like to uh there's an opportunity for someone that's in your position where you have this kind of like insecurity and kind of a little bit of a paranoia against the world
00:29:10.80 --> 00:29:18.24 To go down the path of like drug and alcohol abuse and we all know where that path ends up if we stay on it
00:29:18.24 --> 00:29:23.68 So how how did that enter your life and what what about there had to be drugs now alcohol down there what was
00:29:24.56 --> 00:29:26.56 What was that like what was that influence?
00:29:27.28 --> 00:29:30.32 How how did you manage that part of the world?
00:29:31.60 --> 00:29:38.64 Yeah, you know that's interesting you know I have family members in my own close family that have suffered with addiction and stuff like that
00:29:38.64 --> 00:29:48.32 um and I really love and I also love thinking about this kind of stuff like this kind of stuff from me talking about
00:29:49.52 --> 00:29:51.52 Feelings and stuff some people say well
00:29:52.48 --> 00:30:01.52 You know feelings is the past and actions is what matters and that's true. I believe that like I can think all day and it's probably not gonna help me act any different
00:30:01.52 --> 00:30:08.16 And I know in my own life if I do act a certain way my thoughts will follow me my thoughts really are your troops really
00:30:08.72 --> 00:30:10.72 you know
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:15.52 um they say in a lot of recovery rooms that you can't
00:30:16.16 --> 00:30:21.44 Think your way in the right action, but you can act your way in the right thinking it's a common term and it's easy for
00:30:22.24 --> 00:30:24.24 People that struggle with
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.24 Addiction or addictive personalities to understand that it's real simple
00:30:30.24 --> 00:30:32.24 um
00:30:32.96 --> 00:30:34.96 So
00:30:34.96 --> 00:30:42.24 I was a question. I feel a little bit nervous just just as far as what you know how old were you in alcohol got introduced? How old are you?
00:30:42.24 --> 00:30:44.96 Yeah, we're doing I remember I found some liquor on some
00:30:46.88 --> 00:30:53.68 Alize liquor something peach mango star burst baby breath water melons something on the top shelf
00:30:53.68 --> 00:31:00.08 Who it was nine different colors bro and I found some newty mags up there to same time Teddy literature
00:31:01.20 --> 00:31:06.64 So next thing you know dude. I'm a jack-a-late and just just I remember falling off the shelf
00:31:06.64 --> 00:31:09.28 I thought I'm always I never made it off top shelf to those for their about four hours
00:31:09.84 --> 00:31:13.60 I've never been on the top shelf, you know, I don't come from a real balance in family
00:31:14.32 --> 00:31:20.48 So I'm up there dude. I'm drinking up I can master bait and you know and I remember just black and out and fall and off that shelf
00:31:20.48 --> 00:31:28.08 And I probably fell, man. I bet six and a half feet almost eight feet so not far. How old are you at this time?
00:31:28.08 --> 00:31:31.36 Oh, I was probably about 13, you know, and so then
00:31:31.92 --> 00:31:38.16 But I had other family members who were struggling with drug gen alcohol. So I had this really I didn't see that
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.60 Uh
00:31:41.60 --> 00:31:43.28 I didn't see that as like a
00:31:43.52 --> 00:31:47.52 Away from me to get in a thing like I didn't see that as an escape really from me
00:31:47.52 --> 00:31:50.24 So I never used that as an escape
00:31:51.68 --> 00:31:56.72 But as I got a little bit older my life I started realizing that I was uncomfortable
00:31:57.12 --> 00:31:59.12 uh and I was
00:32:00.16 --> 00:32:04.32 Some of the survival techniques I'd use as a child weren't helping me anymore
00:32:07.20 --> 00:32:11.20 You mean even the comedy piece even making people laugh did that start to wear out?
00:32:12.48 --> 00:32:17.20 Well, or what survival is the only connection that I knew so I had a tough time making
00:32:17.20 --> 00:32:21.92 Reel connections with people especially women if I wanted to be in a relationship or
00:32:22.88 --> 00:32:26.64 Or even I think sometimes friends or knowing that a connection was safe like
00:32:27.28 --> 00:32:29.84 Sometimes I'll overdo a connection somebody will say
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:37.04 Yeah, everything's fine, man. We'll be there and I'll still be hyper worried about it. You know when it's fine it's as somebody else that's totally normal but
00:32:39.28 --> 00:32:45.12 Could some some connections with people are or always feel real new and scary to me
00:32:45.12 --> 00:32:47.12 I think I was a scared to make them
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:51.44 So anyway, I started realizing I was I'm trouble making real connections with people
00:32:52.48 --> 00:32:56.48 People would say man if like I don't know you but I feel like I would be sharing a lot of stuff
00:32:57.84 --> 00:33:00.48 and so then I
00:33:00.72 --> 00:33:07.68 I got into I started going to some recovery meetings 12 step and I couldn't relate to the drugs in alcohol
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:10.56 But I could relate when people talk about how they felt
00:33:11.60 --> 00:33:13.60 you know just
00:33:13.60 --> 00:33:15.60 Just the feelings and so
00:33:16.16 --> 00:33:21.68 I started learning about oh other people feel some of these ways and it's okay to have feelings or to
00:33:22.08 --> 00:33:27.28 struggle with them and whatever and so that's when I really started to like be in a part of recovery
00:33:28.16 --> 00:33:31.36 And there's all types of it, you know, I mean, there's stuff for everything
00:33:31.36 --> 00:33:35.20 There's recovery for people that wear shirts that don't fit or that fit too tightly
00:33:37.60 --> 00:33:40.56 It's really drags me down hang now with echo
00:33:40.56 --> 00:33:44.72 Because I think it's kind of people up you got each other and it just turns into a bad
00:33:44.72 --> 00:33:46.72 So I'm gonna say I see who you're dealer is
00:33:48.72 --> 00:33:53.84 You guys need not behind freaking autos own as fucking pick up a couple extra small
00:33:54.56 --> 00:33:58.000 Head part is there is a small boy out there somewhere right now
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000 Maybe you'll never share it on a shirt
00:34:02.08 --> 00:34:03.68 Have we talked about them before Jacko?
00:34:03.68 --> 00:34:04.72 Did we talk about that?
00:34:04.72 --> 00:34:07.20 Talk about what some boy with a small shirt
00:34:07.20 --> 00:34:09.20 I don't know if we talked about that
00:34:09.20 --> 00:34:14.24 So yeah, so I think that's why I found 12 stuff was interesting and then I pretty that was later in my flight
00:34:14.24 --> 00:34:19.28 Yeah, that was later in life so for a long time I think I just chose comedy because it
00:34:20.80 --> 00:34:26.64 Do instead of comedy oh it's like a lifestyle of disconnection you're in town for four or five days and then you go
00:34:26.64 --> 00:34:32.80 So if you have a relationship starting you're like up, you know, you gotta go to chuckle willies
00:34:32.80 --> 00:34:39.36 Ever into coma you know, it's how it's like you're out of town and then and then you're in a new place where you can have something you know it's like
00:34:41.12 --> 00:34:48.16 The the moss of life never has a chance to grow on you really you keep out running
00:34:49.52 --> 00:34:52.80 The moss really and the moss is things that
00:34:53.68 --> 00:34:59.68 That are real or you know were barnacles anything that you just you just evade things enough
00:34:59.68 --> 00:35:04.08 And comedy just offered me that I don't even know if I wanted to be a comedian
00:35:04.08 --> 00:35:07.28 I think I wanted to not have to be somewhere
00:35:08.32 --> 00:35:14.08 So what how old were you and you did your first you know god on stage and did your first stand-up gig?
00:35:15.84 --> 00:35:17.84 Let me think man
00:35:18.08 --> 00:35:20.08 It was Rwanda dude. I think it was
00:35:20.88 --> 00:35:22.48 2001
00:35:22.48 --> 00:35:24.48 midnight
00:35:24.48 --> 00:35:26.48 And I was in a
00:35:26.48 --> 00:35:31.68 I think I was in a fox hole or Falcon Esther song. I don't know what was happening. Do we couldn't see?
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:36.24 We got a bad badge of banana taffy from a local
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:39.04 She was dicey
00:35:39.04 --> 00:35:41.04 Then we're fire
00:35:41.04 --> 00:35:42.08 Fire ants
00:35:42.08 --> 00:35:47.20 There was a there was not yeah not fire fight. There was actual fire ants in the hole even first. Yeah
00:35:47.76 --> 00:35:49.76 No, sorry, let's tryna
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:52.88 Trying to make you laugh a little but um
00:35:54.48 --> 00:35:56.08 Was it local?
00:35:56.08 --> 00:35:59.60 Oh, yeah, I was cool school when I was oh I remember
00:36:00.08 --> 00:36:05.84 Well the best thing was just at the lunch table with your friends and I think that's the thing you're always chasing as a comedian
00:36:05.84 --> 00:36:10.56 It's just being in an environment where you're just making your friends laugh, you know
00:36:11.84 --> 00:36:16.40 But I went to a class in Los Angeles a lot of people don't even know that I went to a class
00:36:16.64 --> 00:36:23.28 Like a comedy class yeah like when you see written like just like putting those cheesy horns letters on the side of a strip
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:28.48 All the other I was always wondering who's side of the thing there you go apparently may work
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.92 Did it and it was so weird that it was some guy at work. He can not all know so
00:36:35.28 --> 00:36:37.28 Your future of blind at homes
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:45.60 Oh yeah, I think the class was even sponsored by like a pet boy. There's some quick oil offering out
00:36:45.60 --> 00:36:53.04 So man, we were in the class and it was but the interesting you think about the class was it was not very
00:36:53.76 --> 00:36:57.04 I don't know if it was helpful. It was an environment where you were joking around
00:36:58.08 --> 00:37:02.64 But the thing was at the end of the class you got to perform on stage at a real comedy club
00:37:03.36 --> 00:37:10.000 So that was the thing and they taped it for you and this now everybody's got tape this back when that limited amount of tape
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.24 Good so you had a tape maybe had that cassette though, you know and so I remember
00:37:16.80 --> 00:37:21.68 I got a thing that would do three minutes and you were so nervous but then you had a tape and so then you felt like
00:37:22.24 --> 00:37:29.12 Oh, I have a piece of proof you know and then after that they had a comedy room near me just what gentleman had half a little
00:37:30.40 --> 00:37:32.40 And he was
00:37:32.88 --> 00:37:37.44 He was missing part of his leg. I think or he said he was so he could have been fake at it
00:37:37.44 --> 00:37:41.12 CGI or something. I don't know what his name was
00:37:42.40 --> 00:37:44.40 I mean it was a
00:37:44.40 --> 00:37:47.44 CGI it was no it was a white dude. Okay, but
00:37:48.72 --> 00:37:50.08 Anyway
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.40 Yeah, he opened up a comedy room about two blocks from where I was living in LA and I went over there on Wednesdays and
00:37:58.32 --> 00:38:01.92 And there was a couple times right quit. I moved back to New Orleans and they had a comedy room there
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:08.80 How you making money when you're working it? I mean this guy is even paying you or you paying that to get to perform or you paying him
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:13.44 I was a lot of it was a bringer show. You got to bring people and if you don't bring enough you have to pay
00:38:14.24 --> 00:38:18.48 So that was part of it man. That's it that's a under that's a dirty
00:38:19.28 --> 00:38:21.76 Subculture business of a comedy
00:38:22.08 --> 00:38:31.04 Brutal just a bring or show what you said. Yeah, big all bringer shows and you got to bring people with you and if you don't bring like five people and then
00:38:31.04 --> 00:38:37.20 You know, probably ten dollars again and there's something then you have to pay that the difference but on the fifty dollars
00:38:38.08 --> 00:38:45.68 So so this is that's where you start in comedy. That's where it's at yeah, that's really where I start and now and honestly man when I started
00:38:45.68 --> 00:38:47.68 I knew I
00:38:47.68 --> 00:38:50.88 knew that I was doing pretty good at it when I started
00:38:50.88 --> 00:38:53.68 I knew that I could do it and I knew that I could do it and
00:38:54.40 --> 00:38:58.24 Then once the lifestyle came along where you got to scoot around and be
00:38:58.24 --> 00:39:04.64 Anyplace that I didn't have to make a real connection which I didn't realize wasn't a strong suit of mine really
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:07.20 I didn't really realize it at that point. I didn't really realize I was
00:39:07.84 --> 00:39:14.16 Evating something I thought I was going towards something and I think it's probably like that for a lot of us in all types of
00:39:15.28 --> 00:39:16.32 jobs
00:39:16.32 --> 00:39:18.88 You know sometimes the feeling I'm chasing it's
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:25.92 It's not so much something that I'm going for as if I can figure out if there's something that I'm trying to be away from
00:39:25.92 --> 00:39:31.84 You know and that's just for me. I don't know if that's really for everybody in the in the seal teams we used to say like
00:39:33.36 --> 00:39:37.20 Well, you know if I mean things get bad, you know you just get going a trip to get on that plane
00:39:38.24 --> 00:39:42.32 Everything's for everything's gone no more problems you're in some new place everything's great now
00:39:42.56 --> 00:39:44.24 Yeah, that was the that was the deal
00:39:44.24 --> 00:39:48.32 You know, so whatever's happening you know you have some guy living out here in San Diego
00:39:48.32 --> 00:39:51.84 He's having problems with this wife for his girlfriend or whatever cool going on a trip
00:39:51.84 --> 00:39:58.08 Don't complain no problems anymore. They're all gone similar thing. Yeah, evading the problems
00:39:59.20 --> 00:40:03.20 Yeah, and I was and I didn't yeah, and I didn't know I was doing that you know
00:40:03.20 --> 00:40:08.08 I just didn't know and then also you're out there you have you're able to establish brief relationships
00:40:08.08 --> 00:40:12.000 You know one night stands you know a little bit of sex here and there
00:40:12.48 --> 00:40:15.84 a little bit of touch and jerking off next to someone not even sex
00:40:16.48 --> 00:40:20.72 Sometimes or even just jerking off by yourself and wishing somebody was there
00:40:20.72 --> 00:40:24.88 You know, which is really one I mean that was that was probably two out of three
00:40:26.72 --> 00:40:29.52 Like only one of those sounded like a relationship
00:40:29.52 --> 00:40:34.24 You know what's out of like perversion and you're the one who just sounded lovely so I don't know worse
00:40:35.28 --> 00:40:40.48 You know you're kind of getting a taste for maybe what it really is you could be but if you got a good imagination
00:40:40.48 --> 00:40:44.88 Do you could ever feel time right there with you know and I was strong bro in the freaking
00:40:45.52 --> 00:40:48.72 In that middle freaking cold and I was really running some strong suit
00:40:48.72 --> 00:40:54.48 So you would you be out melee how long you out out out now lay for I've been out there
00:40:54.48 --> 00:40:56.80 You know I'd be out there for months at a time
00:40:56.80 --> 00:41:00.64 And then what would make you would you just run out of money and be like I'm going back to Louisiana?
00:41:00.64 --> 00:41:04.64 Yeah, something would be uncomfortable. I have a long term relationship for a little while
00:41:04.64 --> 00:41:07.84 Which is like the closest relationship I could get into is having one with a you know
00:41:08.32 --> 00:41:10.32 thousand miles of space in it and
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 Yeah, so I
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.28 Yeah, and then comedy but comedy kept doing good it was like this thing and when I look back
00:41:21.28 --> 00:41:23.04 I really think it was something God that just
00:41:24.40 --> 00:41:28.64 You know God just wanted to keep taking care of me, you know even though I think when I was young
00:41:28.64 --> 00:41:31.60 I always when I didn't trust the world out in trust God
00:41:31.60 --> 00:41:36.16 I didn't trust that anybody had like was looking out for me. What what years is this?
00:41:37.20 --> 00:41:39.20 This probably 2,000
00:41:39.20 --> 00:41:41.20 and
00:41:41.36 --> 00:41:43.36 Probably 2,000
00:41:43.36 --> 00:41:45.36 9,000 about 2016
00:41:46.16 --> 00:41:47.36 I was saying
00:41:47.36 --> 00:41:50.16 2,000 so during this time you're
00:41:51.04 --> 00:41:54.08 Like what's the progression? Once you would you do good with
00:41:55.20 --> 00:42:00.64 Bring or show once you get good at that like okay now you're almost always gonna have people coming in
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:07.44 At what point do you I will point you you think in yourself all right? I can I can live I can make I can pay my rent
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:09.44 I can get food from
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:13.84 Comedy right why I got I got a credit card
00:42:14.48 --> 00:42:19.36 That's that what point okay when I got that credit card boy then Delta reserve they hit me up in the mail
00:42:19.36 --> 00:42:23.04 Bro, you know and I looked at some of the planes online I said these people are doing well
00:42:23.04 --> 00:42:25.04 I'm open I can't with them
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:27.84 So I went probably about 30 something thousand dollars in debt
00:42:28.72 --> 00:42:32.80 Over probably about four years which was a lot of debt when you never had had
00:42:33.20 --> 00:42:35.60 You know three thousand dollars in a bank account
00:42:35.60 --> 00:42:41.04 So for all those years are you paycheck to paycheck? Yeah, just paycheck to paycheck
00:42:41.04 --> 00:42:46.88 Maybe you have 800 bucks in your bank account maybe you got a thousand maybe did a good show and you maybe got 1400
00:42:46.88 --> 00:42:49.52 But then you got a buy a new freaking whatever
00:42:50.88 --> 00:42:54.40 Yeah, the next flight is the biggest okay was that next flight
00:42:55.28 --> 00:42:57.28 So this is a struggle
00:42:57.68 --> 00:43:03.84 It's a struggle and it's start it is a struggle honestly and I look I know it's it's it's my own struggle
00:43:03.84 --> 00:43:07.52 It's the struggle in that sense. I'm not other people have way bigger struggles
00:43:08.08 --> 00:43:11.76 But it's uh, but that's the struggle part of that job at a minimum
00:43:11.76 --> 00:43:17.04 It's a financial struggle. Yes, and you are you looking at it thinking well, I'll be doing this for
00:43:17.44 --> 00:43:21.36 The rest of my life like for rest of my life. I'm gonna be sitting here, you know going from town to town
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:26.88 Making $480 one night. Is that how much you make when you're one of these level comedians?
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:32.72 No, I think at that point if you do a feature weekend somewhere you can get paid $600 for about five shows
00:43:32.72 --> 00:43:34.72 But you have to buy your flight
00:43:34.88 --> 00:43:40.64 So that takes 300 if you eat on 80 this is a learn it. You know you think about mixed martial arts
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:47.12 Besides UFC like when you're a young these fighters like I've trained a ton of fighters
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:50.56 That's what they're doing yeah, they're they're going to fight in Nebraska
00:43:50.72 --> 00:43:57.04 They're gonna get paid $200 to fight $200 if they win and the flight out there cost freaking 800 bucks
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:01.20 And they got to pay medical for their check-up. It's a freaking disaster
00:44:01.20 --> 00:44:03.20 Yeah
00:44:03.20 --> 00:44:06.24 The same thing right it really is I think I really
00:44:06.24 --> 00:44:10.56 Yeah, at the end of the gather carry it they have two of their teeth taped into their belly button
00:44:11.84 --> 00:44:18.08 It's dicey. Oh, yeah, it's just that circuit. It's that circuit. It's the circuit of that thing and it's
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:24.64 The benefits are the things that keep that are kind of nice and especially if you don't know
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:31.60 If other people are settling down getting married your friends getting real jobs at see more real on paper and
00:44:32.56 --> 00:44:34.56 those things are
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:39.44 I didn't want to be like everybody else that's the thing I always remember my head
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:41.44 I didn't want to be like a lot of people
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:45.04 I wanted to manage my embassy only thing I had was
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:51.60 Everything else in my life since my birth it felt like it was like a sentence like this is who you are you are
00:44:52.56 --> 00:44:54.56 somebody who
00:44:54.56 --> 00:44:59.20 You know, you're not you're not going to be in a home where you were really loved you're not
00:44:59.92 --> 00:45:04.24 You know things like that. I'm not complaining. I'm just sharing what I felt like and it's some of this might
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:09.44 It even be real. That's a crazy part of some of the stuff it could be in your head but if to me it was very real
00:45:11.04 --> 00:45:15.60 So the only thing I could still control was what I what you saw me how I
00:45:15.60 --> 00:45:22.88 What I was you know and I was just getting a hold out to try and be something I
00:45:24.64 --> 00:45:30.32 Don't know if I knew what it was what I was just gonna hold out so when you're a comedian making
00:45:30.88 --> 00:45:34.08 $600 for five shows in a weekend that you had to pay
00:45:34.56 --> 00:45:37.44 $740 for your ticket to get out to wherever you were
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.16 The what is making it at that time because I think it's changed and that's where I was trying to one one
00:45:44.16 --> 00:45:47.36 Yeah, like nowadays you know, there's different avenues since
00:45:47.92 --> 00:45:52.08 What social media is out there and you can use that avenue YouTube you can use that avenue
00:45:52.64 --> 00:45:56.48 Podcasts you can use that there's all these different avenues, but you go rewind
00:45:57.04 --> 00:45:58.40 10 years
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:01.44 Like there's none of that oh yeah, you can't make a living from
00:46:01.84 --> 00:46:03.44 YouTube wasn't even a thing
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:08.80 Yeah, so nothing so you're just just freaking comedy club the comedy club
00:46:09.60 --> 00:46:10.80 What was
00:46:10.80 --> 00:46:16.72 quote making it back then okay, did you get a did you did you did you see that as a possibility?
00:46:17.20 --> 00:46:22.000 I got three thousand I remember it again. May three thousand did the comedy central like
00:46:22.24 --> 00:46:26.40 10 minutes or something and they give you a three thousand three thousand for comedy central
00:46:26.40 --> 00:46:32.000 Yeah, you do 10 minutes they give you $3000. Yeah, the big-ass network a comedy center
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:34.16 That's like these fight organizations
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:41.92 It's the ultimate fighting kind of the all-the-eye was comedy. It was just it was like obviously
00:46:42.32 --> 00:46:46.56 It was just a different day. It was just a different day no wider. It's just a different organization, you know
00:46:47.28 --> 00:46:52.000 But then also they had all the eyeballs then they had the eyeballs and so yes
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.36 So you got a little money and then you start to get a little neurotic no rioty from the deal from like you could
00:46:57.76 --> 00:47:01.52 Show people oh I really am a comedian that was that that's the scariest part of the comedian
00:47:01.52 --> 00:47:03.52 Because you're a comedian and
00:47:04.24 --> 00:47:11.12 Then do you could tell people here a comedian, but it's a real weird thing to tell people until you have some proof
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:15.04 That you are a dude because unless not you could be a just a
00:47:16.32 --> 00:47:18.16 Just a I'm a comedian for all-perfect
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:21.20 You're a person right you know, well, I'm a comedian you can be a murderer
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.80 Do a better suited to be a murderer than a comedian. It's all good definitely man and I always love
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:34.56 Pippin Tom and man since I was a kid did I love Pippin Tom that's really not one of the best things to talk about on the podcast
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:37.36 If you want to maintain you know yourself not being a person
00:47:39.20 --> 00:47:45.12 Look, I'm a recovery freaking pita your baby, you know, but that's one thing you need about recovery and being on the circles
00:47:45.12 --> 00:47:46.96 I have friends that are flashers dude
00:47:46.96 --> 00:47:52.16 I have friends that have I mean I have friends that have just gone and knocked on the devil's door
00:47:52.16 --> 00:47:58.000 Dude and waited there till he opened it. You know, I'm saying bro and the devil works over time. Yeah, rarely as he hung
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000 He's 247 open in that door up. So if you're a male and out there does hanging on that friggin velcom
00:48:05.28 --> 00:48:10.88 So so comedy central you got this money and now you're kind of I mean other calm coming to you
00:48:10.88 --> 00:48:15.60 I'm gonna choose yes, but also other comedians you're kind of like elevated right? Yeah, you started to get elevated
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:17.60 You're sort of a man yeah
00:48:17.60 --> 00:48:22.64 Little bit you get enough that booth that then it tells you okay this path is starting to choose you
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:25.60 There's I think there's a unique moment in different paths where
00:48:26.72 --> 00:48:31.60 Your chew your your your putting yourself into the path and then the path is also saying hey
00:48:32.24 --> 00:48:38.64 You know putting its handouts and I do believe that for a comedians man at a certain point it kind of chooses you
00:48:39.44 --> 00:48:44.88 So once you do comedy central now our when you're going to a comedy club are you headlining now?
00:48:44.88 --> 00:48:50.32 You have a credit you're getting close and you're starting to headline and then you get like 1500 a week
00:48:50.88 --> 00:48:54.32 So that's when you can start to save a little money and and
00:48:55.52 --> 00:49:01.68 And you're not selling tickets though you were just most people are coming there's a few people come to see you maybe 10 15 people
00:49:02.24 --> 00:49:04.08 But also back then the
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:10.16 The clubs had all the email list they were a gatekeeper so they you know you don't have all that you can start to put it together
00:49:10.16 --> 00:49:12.56 We'd put the cards on the table fill it out and like
00:49:12.56 --> 00:49:17.36 But then you're coming before you have to do that and and I did it all man put the boxes with the cards
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:20.64 See are you do you have a manager or whatever like that thing?
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:24.16 Yes, you have a manager that helps you through the agencies to get booked
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:30.88 But you don't have you taking their cut. Yeah, they take their cut so you're getting 1500 bucks and they're taking one 50
00:49:30.88 --> 00:49:35.20 On 50 and then the agent would take one 50 and so then you down a 12 there
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.52 but
00:49:37.52 --> 00:49:40.64 But yeah, you still grind it and I still didn't have any other
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:50.000 In life there's only so you you I find you I mean they're doing something that I want to be doing or I'm a touch in my life to other people
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.60 And maybe starting a family kind there's not really a ton of different things to do you know
00:49:57.28 --> 00:50:01.84 Really I mean you just so I didn't I didn't have anything on that other side of the coin
00:50:01.84 --> 00:50:05.92 I didn't have any place where I felt like I could make a commitment or start a family so I'm like well
00:50:05.92 --> 00:50:12.88 This is this shoe just fits so well right now. How how many days a year are you touring at this time?
00:50:12.88 --> 00:50:15.20 Oh, I did man. I probably did 48 weeks a year
00:50:16.32 --> 00:50:18.16 I toured hard man. I toured
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:25.52 I toured hard man. I really did and some of and here's a crazy thing. This is one thing I noticed about a brain of somebody that has
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:29.20 has maybe issues with
00:50:30.88 --> 00:50:33.84 Alcoholism stuff like that my brain forgets that
00:50:33.84 --> 00:50:37.52 My friend forgets work forgets all that I did all that work
00:50:39.04 --> 00:50:43.20 So my brain every day has this weird govern around it that's like man you
00:50:44.40 --> 00:50:50.32 You got to do something and you know you haven't done anything you know I got this weird and I sometimes I don't know where
00:50:50.32 --> 00:50:54.32 Some of that comes from and and those are things. I still want to figure out in my life
00:50:54.32 --> 00:50:57.04 You know where does that come from you know some of those things so
00:50:58.08 --> 00:51:01.68 Those are things I love kind of thinking about and talk with people about it's like
00:51:01.68 --> 00:51:03.68 um
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:05.68 Yeah, where do these weird like
00:51:06.48 --> 00:51:09.76 This weird legal system that's that I built into my soul
00:51:11.12 --> 00:51:18.88 Where does that where does that all come from and and it's interesting you can figure some of the times you can figure some of that out by talking with other people about
00:51:19.28 --> 00:51:26.72 That sort of thing anyway. What do you feel like the prosecution and the defense are our arguing over with the legal system? That's in your head
00:51:26.72 --> 00:51:34.48 But the prosecution is always just a never there was never like a base foundation that I'm okay
00:51:35.76 --> 00:51:41.84 So when I don't have that then anything else has a really good chance of infiltrating and
00:51:42.56 --> 00:51:46.16 Getting really into me because there never was this
00:51:50.40 --> 00:51:54.80 Like out of friend one time who just texted me that hey man, you're okay, you know just out of the blue
00:51:54.80 --> 00:51:58.56 And because he knows we talked about stuff he's in recovery and
00:51:59.44 --> 00:52:05.52 Man, that shit just hit me like never in my life. I just heard that or and it just came through it a certain way where I heard it
00:52:05.52 --> 00:52:09.36 I was like oh man and just I'm just like ball. I'm just like
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:15.20 So I think just when you don't have that weird that foundation of that anybody just telling you that or the world
00:52:15.20 --> 00:52:20.48 To are just like you feel in it, you know them you feel sometimes you always will feel susceptible
00:52:21.20 --> 00:52:23.20 to any other
00:52:23.20 --> 00:52:24.56 Then of course you have to build your own
00:52:25.36 --> 00:52:29.52 Thing in your head that's like you gotta get going you gotta get you gotta pull yourself up by the bootchecks
00:52:29.52 --> 00:52:31.04 You so you do that
00:52:31.04 --> 00:52:35.60 But then after you're doing well even that thing still going on that's a childhood system
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:40.80 You put in that bitch is loose dude and that bitch is out there fucking party is got tits dude
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:43.92 You don't understand this turn it up and it's fucking it
00:52:43.92 --> 00:52:47.52 It just doesn't there's no control but that thing has been with you for so long
00:52:47.52 --> 00:52:55.44 That is hard to get new systems in place to stop those survival things because something had to be in my head
00:52:55.44 --> 00:52:57.44 It's tell me to keep going you know
00:52:58.24 --> 00:53:04.20 But as you get older it's just still running on the same childhood system the same original
00:53:04.20 --> 00:53:06.20 DOS or whatever Microsoft DOS
00:53:06.72 --> 00:53:10.40 So did you ever have a point where you're like in
00:53:10.40 --> 00:53:19.20 In freakin whatever upstate New York you just performed in front of seven people that were talking while you were up on stage
00:53:19.20 --> 00:53:23.12 And then you had to pay the money and you were like, you know what dude?
00:53:23.12 --> 00:53:25.12 I'm going to get a job and make it these
00:53:25.12 --> 00:53:27.12 Did you have that
00:53:27.12 --> 00:53:37.32 Yeah, yeah, I got a do in tacos selling Mexican food to peeing and I'd sold all kind of food to people of a restaurant and stuff like that
00:53:37.32 --> 00:53:38.32 I used to sell
00:53:38.32 --> 00:53:41.44 I sold Mexican food to people when I was younger too
00:53:41.44 --> 00:53:46.28 But did you ever have a point where you would like yeah, I gave up at that point. Where's a point where I gave up?
00:53:46.28 --> 00:53:50.20 Oh, you gave up on comedy at some point. Yeah, I had this girl had it was in this long-term
00:53:50.84 --> 00:53:55.60 Relationship and I went back to New Orleans and worked at a bar and we was selling Mexican food to people

00:57:05.72 --> 00:57:10.000 Yeah, I couldn't commit to the relationship I was in and I just went back to LA and so
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.88 And then things like I started
00:57:13.92 --> 00:57:18.72 I don't know what happened then, but I started picking up some steam and that's when pot some podcasting started and
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:26.80 And I just was really fortunate man. You know my producer Nick Davis who's a great guy as a huge fan of yours
00:57:26.80 --> 00:57:32.24 And so you were gracious enough to come on and rogue and had me on his podcast at the same time and
00:57:32.88 --> 00:57:35.04 a couple of other little things happen where
00:57:35.04 --> 00:57:39.64 Suddenly a kind of had a fan base. I don't know if there was much space in between
00:57:39.64 --> 00:57:41.84 Oh, I didn't Netflix special that didn't do anything
00:57:42.72 --> 00:57:47.08 Then wait, what came out first the net flick special it looks yeah, okay, so that thing came out
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:49.20 But it doesn't really matter no one really notices
00:57:49.20 --> 00:57:56.000 It did not the man. I was so excited. I remember I went to chat new gum all fired up and I'm thinking it's gonna be packed man
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.80 And it was a small it was even a big club and there was nine people in there
00:58:01.20 --> 00:58:03.20 So when stuff like that happens
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:08.56 That's got to be tough to power through. I mean when you're especially with everything you've said so far tonight
00:58:09.12 --> 00:58:14.22 About the one people laughter and approval and all this stuff and you really send that flick's piece
00:58:17.96 --> 00:58:19.96 And this is
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:26.04 Echo what do you think man? I'll say that for so many him echo you don't even repeat much
00:58:26.04 --> 00:58:28.04 Oh
00:58:36.04 --> 00:58:38.28 It's painful oh it's painful, bro
00:58:38.28 --> 00:58:41.48 But when painful here's a crazy thing about painful man
00:58:41.80 --> 00:58:48.68 When most of what you know when your life feels like painful then I think shit like that just kind of fucking fits on the ship
00:58:48.68 --> 00:58:55.04 So how are you so for other people right because other people are having their chat and you go experience
00:58:55.04 --> 00:58:58.80 We're nine people show up there having you know whatever happened in their life. What did you do?
00:58:58.80 --> 00:59:04.000 Because here's another thing when you you know we talk about Gary V and I've I people will assess this about me too
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Because it's like hard work hard work hard work and I just had this conversation with someone the other day
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.40 They're like you know yeah, my company hard work doesn't necessarily mean you get promoted
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:17.96 I'm like that's true everywhere hard work doesn't necessarily like you can't just expect
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:21.12 I'm just gonna work hard work hard work hard and that then things are just gonna happen
00:59:21.12 --> 00:59:26.56 If that if it was I hate to say if it was that easy and a lot more people do it not everyone do hard work
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:29.28 But a lot of people would do it a lot of people would start working hard
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:33.92 But you gotta have like you I'm sure you've seen comedians along the way that were really hard work
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:39.12 They're doing hey I wrote another 19 jokes and like and you read them and they all suck right?
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:44.64 So when you get done with this Netflix special you're all amped your expectations are so high
00:59:45.44 --> 00:59:47.44 You show up. There's no one there
00:59:47.44 --> 00:59:50.88 How do you how do you power through that how do you get through that what you do?
00:59:50.88 --> 00:59:54.16 I don't know I made out with this big dick girl. I remember that
00:59:54.96 --> 00:59:59.84 Okay, bro can we get some like some a little bit more than thick girls making out okay?
01:00:00.40 --> 01:00:02.40 I mean that's how uh
01:00:02.40 --> 01:00:05.20 Okay, you been there to be in from the islands or whatever
01:00:05.92 --> 01:00:10.48 So yeah, man. I mean it's like I freaking did it you know. I remember yeah
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:12.80 Well, that was it that was an interesting thing about comedy clubs
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:17.84 It's coming comes just a bar. It's a bar hook to a stage so it's like then there was always a couple
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:22.40 You could always get a couple drinks at the end of the night to kind of say shit yourself and I was never a big drink
01:00:22.40 --> 01:00:25.12 I'd have maybe two drinks you know, but um
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.80 But after that I don't know I started to get
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:36.000 You know I don't know really what happened. I just knew that that wasn't it that Holly oh somebody wrote an article
01:00:36.24 --> 01:00:39.52 I remember right when my special came out and
01:00:39.52 --> 01:00:42.96 It said like oh
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:46.88 This would be Donald Trump's favorite comedian or something. It was like a negative
01:00:46.88 --> 01:00:51.20 It was I think it was right around the time maybe when some of that campaigning was started or something
01:00:52.96 --> 01:01:00.16 And it was and a lot of my stuff is sarcasm like a character also it's me, but it's also this it's a
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.60 Our caricature of like where you're from right right it's a mix really
01:01:05.60 --> 01:01:10.48 Right and that made me really not trust any of like
01:01:10.96 --> 01:01:13.52 Hollywood tabloids any of that kind of shit so
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:20.80 And it just was so debilitating you works so hard and somebody just does something just completely errands and aimless you know
01:01:22.80 --> 01:01:25.60 When you watched your own Netflix special
01:01:26.40 --> 01:01:30.48 Will you like oh yeah, oh you kind of like damn oh you neutral
01:01:30.48 --> 01:01:32.48 I
01:01:32.48 --> 01:01:39.44 Feel okay about it. I felt like I went too fast during the material. I felt like I was probably a little nervous and went too fast
01:01:41.44 --> 01:01:44.24 So I never really looked back on it super fondly
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:51.92 But but then at that point things started to evolve in some podcasts and started going from my perspective
01:01:53.76 --> 01:02:00.000 So I didn't know who I didn't I this is it's funny because as I was like reading about your background and trying to figure out
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.80 Because I thought you just like everybody thinks I thought oh he just made it famous overnight or whatever
01:02:04.80 --> 01:02:11.52 That's kind of and I didn't as I researched I was like oh this dude's been doing comedy for like whatever two decades or a long time
01:02:11.52 --> 01:02:13.52 Yeah, I saw a long time and
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:16.96 There was a video it was free corner
01:02:17.44 --> 01:02:22.08 That little video that you made you know what I'm talking about free corner. Yeah, dude with that bus. Yeah, yeah
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:28.40 You that great-hand dude. Yeah, we just had a great-hand driver on the podcast man. I used to go around all the time
01:02:28.40 --> 01:02:33.24 I think I go in there somebody freaking somebody's like you want to see something and it's always their dick
01:02:33.24 --> 01:02:35.92 I know you don't understand bro. It's like come on bro
01:02:36.24 --> 01:02:41.60 So so the you do pull his dick out of a hat, you know like how you even get your dick in
01:02:41.60 --> 01:02:43.92 Yeah, you know, that's supposed to be a rabbit
01:02:44.64 --> 01:02:47.60 Just a lot of pretty shit magicians man out there, bro
01:02:47.60 --> 01:02:56.000 So I saw that thing and and just I was dying laughing I kind of shared it with all my friends because everyone kind of likes MMA and here
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.48 You were talking about you know bust and ever and kind of my generation did went on Greyhounds, right?
01:03:02.48 --> 01:03:07.60 So we kind of knew I don't think a lot any in California like no one takes public transit
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.08 So it's different but across the country man you've been to a Greyhound station or
01:03:12.08 --> 01:03:17.68 Or you've seen some you know you've seen some shit man in your life if you've been to Greyhound
01:03:17.68 --> 01:03:22.08 You've been to a girl. Yeah, dude. I saw a lady drinking a can of
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:25.60 Baby formula dude
01:03:25.60 --> 01:03:31.36 Simple apple. Yeah, you said that on that video. I didn't even know I didn't like what I thought it was some kind of
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:32.000 True
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.20 I
01:03:33.20 --> 01:03:37.04 That's making me think I had a Google it man. So so you did that
01:03:37.04 --> 01:03:42.72 You go on rogan for the first time and this is what I want to say is that when
01:03:43.76 --> 01:03:47.36 I think you had like a or you have and still have like a
01:03:48.56 --> 01:03:57.28 Like a full of vulnerability and honesty about yourself that I think is really different and I think that
01:03:57.92 --> 01:04:02.72 That is what makes people make makes people made me the first time I heard y'all's like oh, yeah, he's not
01:04:02.72 --> 01:04:09.36 He's exposing himself, you know not in it's not in the way that your friends do whatever the flashers are that you're hanging out with but
01:04:09.60 --> 01:04:13.04 Exposing yourself. I'm not saying you were on a text like a
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:15.60 You know support
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:23.84 But yes, so I think that was a huge thing that I think a lot of people connected as soon as they kind of heard you and heard you talking to Joe
01:04:24.24 --> 01:04:30.40 And and freaking Joe. I mean obviously his his podcast is so massive and and he's such a good guy
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:35.68 And you know was telling everyone oh, yeah, this guy's hilarious. I mean I remember he told I think you told me
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.88 Yeah, he did he was like well, if that's guys freaking hilarious. You know how's like hey, do you be seeing this similar act
01:04:40.88 --> 01:04:44.16 Bang or whatever whatever brought it up he's like oh, I guys hilarious
01:04:44.72 --> 01:04:48.24 So so then you when did you start your podcast? I
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:55.20 Started I did a podcast with a friend for about probably two years that was about more like interviewing people that was in Hollywood
01:04:55.28 --> 01:04:59.84 My friend worked at TMZ and we tried a podcast together and it was fun
01:04:59.84 --> 01:05:03.04 But I didn't get to be myself. I had to like it was more interviewing
01:05:03.68 --> 01:05:09.36 You know and I didn't really like that as much and so then once at one day I walked out of Rogans and I said
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:12.56 I need to do something more like that
01:05:12.56 --> 01:05:20.24 I didn't know that that's I don't think I knew until I was there and hands on in the environment that that's the way you could do it
01:05:20.64 --> 01:05:23.76 Even by listening I didn't get the concept a hundred percent
01:05:23.76 --> 01:05:28.56 And then I walked out of it. I need to do something more like that
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:36.64 And so I just started then I started one of my kitchen and just started kind of talking about stuff and things that I was thinking about and uh
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:40.40 And yeah, and it's been
01:05:41.36 --> 01:05:46.72 Yeah, it's been a it's been a place sometimes where I share maybe more than I should sometimes and I don't realize it
01:05:48.24 --> 01:05:49.92 It's been a lot of different things man
01:05:49.92 --> 01:05:52.80 Um sometimes it's been a blessing because it's the
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:57.28 It's like that thing that keeps me going each week. It's like a guaranteed thing
01:05:57.52 --> 01:06:04.56 You know the longest relationship I've had in my life sometimes is with my podcast and a lot of ways. It's the one thing that I'll show up for every week even
01:06:05.44 --> 01:06:07.44 um
01:06:09.20 --> 01:06:13.04 Even on times I noticed like why don't feel good like the past maybe two years I haven't felt really good
01:06:13.04 --> 01:06:18.48 Something's I think physically kind of I don't know what it is. I'm doing like a lot of blood work and doing all these different therapies and like
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:23.28 Trying to kind of figure out why don't feel as good as I used to I physically don't feel good
01:06:24.40 --> 01:06:25.60 So
01:06:25.60 --> 01:06:31.04 The hardest thing sometimes is we don't feel good to go in a into an environment and put yourself out. It's like
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.32 You almost want to hide from people you don't feel you want to wait to you feel okay to get out there and like you know
01:06:37.92 --> 01:06:42.80 So that's been one of the most challenging things is on weeks where I don't really feel that great
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:46.88 To put myself out put myself right there
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:50.96 It's like you just sometimes you like man. I don't want to see people to see me not in my best
01:06:51.76 --> 01:06:53.76 Especially when
01:06:53.76 --> 01:06:58.96 The only thing I've always had is my own image how you see me. It's like it's it makes it real dicey sometimes
01:06:58.96 --> 01:07:02.16 But at the same time man. I've learned a lot about people through
01:07:02.72 --> 01:07:10.000 Podcasts and you know I'm just enamored to none of the people that come out and the sweet the release nice stories that they share you know
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.96 Uh, um, and then people will share stuff with me that mean something to them sometimes like
01:07:17.68 --> 01:07:22.08 Some guy came up to me this morning at the cafe and said hey man. I got five years over you know and
01:07:24.32 --> 01:07:28.48 And you just so excited when you see how somebody's life gets different or better and
01:07:29.52 --> 01:07:35.68 Not that I have anything to do with that. I don't feel like I do but just that he wants to share that with me and then he feels okay share and you know
01:07:35.68 --> 01:07:37.68 Um
01:07:38.08 --> 01:07:40.08 Things like that man. It's
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:47.28 That's one thing I've learned I think through podcast and is really a power in kind of
01:07:48.48 --> 01:07:52.80 Even though it's not real human connection. It's not the hand-to-hand combat of
01:07:53.60 --> 01:07:56.64 Of human connection because we're through microphones and stuff
01:07:58.32 --> 01:08:03.04 It's been surprising to me how many people connect you know and how many people feel and
01:08:03.04 --> 01:08:07.84 How much feelings you can get through stuff. It's it's pretty remarkable sometimes
01:08:08.40 --> 01:08:11.12 So anyway, I don't really know what I'm talking about but
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:16.56 Yeah, it's interesting because you were made it you know you're joking around earlier about how
01:08:17.04 --> 01:08:23.20 You know you're sorry, not being funny right now on this podcast or supposed and that's what's interesting about that is
01:08:24.40 --> 01:08:27.92 You you have some pretty serious stuff that you do on your podcast. You have some you know
01:08:27.92 --> 01:08:33.52 You kind of sometimes you open up about stuff and how you feeling and it maybe it's not feeling that good and
01:08:34.24 --> 01:08:38.48 And again, I think that people tune into that because look man if I
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:43.92 Guess I guess you could try and like fake being funny or fake being in a good mood
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:49.28 But I don't think you can really fake it 100% where people really believe it and I think it's better that you
01:08:49.92 --> 01:08:54.24 Just be who you are and and you know if you got something if you're not if you feel like
01:08:54.24 --> 01:09:00.80 Freaking depressed or whatever then you're like hey, this is what I feel like right now and it makes people
01:09:01.04 --> 01:09:06.96 comfortable that there's someone like you who's usually funny and it seems to have a pretty good life and all
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:12.08 But something like hey man, this is freaking hard right now for whatever reason whatever that reason right might be and
01:09:13.04 --> 01:09:15.04 You know I think
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:17.04 when people
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:22.40 Just knowing that someone else is kind of like bear with them. It's really a shirt. Yeah
01:09:22.40 --> 01:09:28.000 And the other thing that's interesting about this is you've been saying this whole time you know that you have a hard time with
01:09:29.44 --> 01:09:33.36 Relationships and long-term and all this but how long you've been doing your podcast for
01:09:34.16 --> 01:09:37.36 For maybe five years so five years and
01:09:37.92 --> 01:09:40.80 This is the thing about podcast and I have the same thing where
01:09:41.44 --> 01:09:44.24 I meet people that listen to podcasts and
01:09:45.12 --> 01:09:49.60 They feel like we have a relationship. Yeah, and they're right right because
01:09:49.60 --> 01:09:54.96 You don't get you don't you don't I mean my podcast is three four five hours long
01:09:55.60 --> 01:09:58.000 I don't think it now I see what happened to you
01:09:59.20 --> 01:10:01.60 Yeah, you said things probably years ago
01:10:02.40 --> 01:10:05.92 And there's just not much in there. I bet if we tickle you get a mouth
01:10:06.48 --> 01:10:08.48 Creep
01:10:08.48 --> 01:10:15.12 How often do you sit down and talk to anyone for three hours or two hours? I walked out of your room and I remember
01:10:15.12 --> 01:10:18.72 Tell him I said hey that's the longest conversation I've ever had in my life with anybody
01:10:18.72 --> 01:10:20.72 It's best you with a man
01:10:20.72 --> 01:10:24.56 Like I didn't have any male figure. I had you know there was no male
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:31.04 Figures in my neighborhood one got shot up a ready-made 24 hour clinic and that was like the toughest do we knit?
01:10:31.60 --> 01:10:34.88 You know and he was on pill so he wasn't even really doing it out of his own heart
01:10:35.92 --> 01:10:38.64 so you know we didn't have a lot of uh
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:46.16 So I think yes, I've found more probably male influences through podcasting
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:51.76 Then anywhere else in my life really which is kind of interesting
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:56.56 You know
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:02.48 And sometimes uh yeah, I don't know podcast and powerful and here's one thing that's neat too Jaco is I mostly meet people
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:05.36 Who I would like to meet anyway
01:11:05.36 --> 01:11:10.40 Hmm it's like they got it came up to me this morning. You know I would like to meet him in you know like
01:11:11.04 --> 01:11:13.04 He was some people's
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:21.44 Like I did reach some reality tell was when I was younger you know for a couple years on TV and I would meet people that I didn't know anything about me
01:11:21.44 --> 01:11:23.44 Just people that see you and
01:11:23.92 --> 01:11:27.20 That was just there was nothing to it that meant anything really
01:11:28.40 --> 01:11:29.68 So
01:11:29.68 --> 01:11:30.88 To meet people where you you
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:35.60 They know you somewhat and you so you would have some common ground, you know
01:11:36.16 --> 01:11:38.16 It's really nice almost it
01:11:38.40 --> 01:11:42.64 That's one thing it's interesting man. I feel like God has given me this weird way where it's like
01:11:45.92 --> 01:11:47.92 He
01:11:48.40 --> 01:11:52.72 He always is trying to show me that people care about me, you know because I think for so long
01:11:52.72 --> 01:11:57.60 I didn't feel like anybody did you know when I was real real young and I'm not complaining and you know
01:11:57.60 --> 01:12:01.76 I'm not complaining about it. I'm not I don't need any self pity. I don't need anything like that
01:12:05.68 --> 01:12:07.68 But I do think it's fascinating how
01:12:09.12 --> 01:12:12.56 You know he'll send people in every you know every now and then somebody says something
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:19.92 No, I just something it's like it's just slow healing of this space inside of me that was just has been uncomfortable for a long time
01:12:20.64 --> 01:12:25.12 You know and so there's powerful stuff like that going on, you know so
01:12:25.12 --> 01:12:30.96 And and and and sometimes I can do that for other people you know I know a friend of mine
01:12:32.80 --> 01:12:34.80 He's in the military. I think his dad had some
01:12:36.32 --> 01:12:40.40 Well, I probably should talk about my talking on a shop, but yeah, it's just I don't know
01:12:41.20 --> 01:12:43.20 I don't know man
01:12:43.20 --> 01:12:46.80 I'm enjoying being alive these days a lot more because I want to see what else
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:50.96 Can unfold you know and I don't know if I always felt like that as a kid
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:58.000 I felt like more like every day was a battle, you know where is now I'm like man every there's there's a lot of good stuff out there
01:12:58.08 --> 01:13:04.96 You know and I can be a part of it whether it's for me or somebody else if I can just do my best to take care of myself and
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:07.36 Keep myself
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:10.80 I don't even have to win every day, but do if I can just show up and get a strong tie dog
01:13:12.24 --> 01:13:14.24 If I can even fucking tip a judge fam
01:13:14.24 --> 01:13:21.04 I'm saying dog and pull out that dirty w dog, you know then it's possible and I wish Darren Till would know lost honestly
01:13:22.40 --> 01:13:24.40 No homo bro
01:13:25.36 --> 01:13:27.36 Speaking of
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:31.36 Fighting what about your jitter where you're at I haven't gone to probably about two and a half months
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:34.16 I just kept getting hurt so bad who are you training with man?
01:13:34.16 --> 01:13:37.60 You got to get fine somebody that's gonna be a little bit more relaxed when I train with you
01:13:37.60 --> 01:13:42.88 Oh dude, I'm training with locals bro dude and I was one strike white belt man
01:13:42.88 --> 01:13:47.28 And last time I even left because I couldn't find park and dude, so that's kind of why I'm at right now
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.76 That's not that
01:13:49.76 --> 01:13:50.72 That is not a good thing
01:13:50.72 --> 01:13:53.76 I've been taking a lot of yoga because some of it was my flexibility and
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:59.68 And I kept getting hurt so bad like for me anywhere I couldn't like I need to do comedy
01:13:59.68 --> 01:14:03.04 I was getting ready we just taped a Netflix special it's coming out in October
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:06.72 this when I'm proud about I felt excited
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:11.36 This one is more of a reflection. I feel like of
01:14:11.36 --> 01:14:17.28 Just more of a confident me as a comedian. You know, so what what goes into?
01:14:18.16 --> 01:14:21.04 What goes into that how long does it take to get ready?
01:14:21.76 --> 01:14:28.56 Who contacts you like what's happened if if echo Charles was gonna do a Netflix special what would it look like
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:30.32 How long would it take what do we do?
01:14:30.32 --> 01:14:33.92 Corribbean I would bet you know Bill offense dude you could be from New York
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:40.72 But I would probably do yeah something maybe tropical you know it was some ocean sounds in the back
01:14:41.36 --> 01:14:45.44 You know maybe get that Viet and me's got to go by drinking that cranberry on the skateboard
01:14:46.40 --> 01:14:51.04 You know I would get it kind of you know maybe slightly urban you know maybe somebody playing you know
01:14:51.04 --> 01:14:53.84 Maybe a dog up near a chaint length fence and the bat
01:14:55.44 --> 01:14:58.24 And then if you can't tell that I would sing dude, I think you would enjoy that
01:14:59.44 --> 01:15:02.40 There's something I'm watching a strong man saying dude it's pretty powerful
01:15:02.40 --> 01:15:05.76 It's kind of like jewel, but for people in sterile
01:15:07.12 --> 01:15:09.12 Studying the rain
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:11.36 You're always crazy like that
01:15:12.72 --> 01:15:14.72 What do you ask him out?
01:15:14.72 --> 01:15:19.36 Netflix special so you got a net of the special coming out so this is what last one maybe you say you didn't feel
01:15:19.36 --> 01:15:24.96 100% on this one you feel 100% this one I feel a lot better what made you feel but what made how do you prepare for it?
01:15:25.60 --> 01:15:29.44 Well one thing I did stop doing was due to just because I kept my ribs kept getting cracked
01:15:29.44 --> 01:15:35.36 So I mean it was just I mean dude you couldn't do any yoga so when I don't do physical things to take care of myself
01:15:35.36 --> 01:15:37.36 I start mentally feeling bad
01:15:37.36 --> 01:15:42.40 Keep point by the way keep point for everybody you just heard it from Theo if you
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:46.92 If you can't do physical stuff you're gonna start feeling bad mentally facts
01:15:47.28 --> 01:15:53.84 So go do physical stuff. Yeah, I have to and it's not even fair for me any more to evaluate myself sometimes
01:15:53.84 --> 01:15:58.80 If I haven't been physically active because I'm not giving myself a fair chance really
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:01.36 You know I have to be able to take care of myself
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.52 I have to be able to be thinking with a brain that's you know healthy so
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.28 Yes, so I noticed that but anyway they gave us a budget and we made and
01:16:10.96 --> 01:16:17.12 I wanted to I wanted to do one where I felt like this one is gonna I'm gonna do I'm gonna do right
01:16:17.12 --> 01:16:24.48 And I got to hire the production production company and I've gotten to go through the editing more and it's been tedious
01:16:24.48 --> 01:16:30.08 But the the months before it I had a yoga instructor coming to my home every couple of days
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:34.96 I was doing I had a weight trainer I had a weight trainer
01:16:35.68 --> 01:16:39.60 I was doing a lot of stuff to take care of myself, you know
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:46.000 And where'd you dig for the material the material I bought I had about six years to get some good material
01:16:46.32 --> 01:16:50.80 The hard part was COVID it was so fresh at 2019 the material was ready to go
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:53.36 You know it was just like a damn
01:16:54.56 --> 01:16:58.72 I mean it was really just like a damn newborn like a strong newborn
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:01.20 You know I'm saying one that fucking elbow crawls out
01:17:01.60 --> 01:17:04.08 You know with a can of freaking go in a car
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:08.72 I know I said they kind of baby that beats mom
01:17:09.28 --> 01:17:15.20 Okay, like this thing was ready to go this thing was ten months in the this thing was I go to make
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:20.16 Um, and then COVID hits and then COVID hit so then you have all this down time
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:26.000 So I did move to Nashville and bought I bought a home in Nashville and because the stage was still open
01:17:26.48 --> 01:17:28.96 So I could still go and keep this material fresh enough
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:35.68 And then I did a couple weeks in LA because there's a lot of stage time there
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:44.48 Um about six weeks ago I went there for a few weeks and got it ready and then put it down and put it down in Nashville and
01:17:45.20 --> 01:17:50.72 It was great man. We had like 6,000 people came out damn and uh that's massive for comedy isn't it?
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:56.48 It's pretty good we did three shows of 2000. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, I don't yeah otherwise it would be too big
01:17:56.80 --> 01:18:00.000 This venue was just kind of real perfect enough to rhyme and over there and
01:18:01.60 --> 01:18:03.60 Yeah, so it was good man
01:18:03.60 --> 01:18:06.40 And it was good and I involved myself more in the editing
01:18:06.64 --> 01:18:10.64 You know, I've seen a lot of the ropes now. I know when I can assert myself and
01:18:11.76 --> 01:18:15.20 Sometimes I don't do it that well, sometimes I'm too aggressive. Do they record all the shows?
01:18:15.84 --> 01:18:18.64 The first one was so bad it was like people were haggling
01:18:19.20 --> 01:18:22.72 We built a set that literally looked like a pedophiles
01:18:23.20 --> 01:18:28.08 Like a pedophile it opened a candy shop do that's how it was okay. Like this is on purpose
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:30.64 No
01:18:30.64 --> 01:18:33.76 Now great question
01:18:35.52 --> 01:18:36.72 And you still don't say anything
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:41.12 You know you could listen at home, man
01:18:41.12 --> 01:18:43.36 Okay, you're making people uncomfortable
01:18:44.72 --> 01:18:48.64 I'm just joking bro. He's a like a nice guy. I'm just just joking but I don't want to make it
01:18:48.64 --> 01:18:50.64 So you make this
01:18:50.64 --> 01:18:54.64 And it looked bad bro. I got there. I was so angry when I saw the set
01:18:55.84 --> 01:18:59.44 Because I didn't make it somebody that I paid somebody what make it what was the goal of this set
01:18:59.44 --> 01:19:03.44 It was supposed to the back of the rhyme and has these beautiful windows and
01:19:04.80 --> 01:19:09.92 We wanted to make the windows on stage. He's colorful kind of church churchy churchy kind of windows
01:19:11.28 --> 01:19:14.72 And we didn't do it. It looked like so did they change it that night?
01:19:14.72 --> 01:19:18.24 It looked like a gingerbread house dude for John Wayne Dacy
01:19:18.24 --> 01:19:24.32 It was like as if he had entered a sweet G-B-G-B house contest for he freaking got busted
01:19:25.28 --> 01:19:27.28 if he did it
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:29.28 Who if he did it?
01:19:29.68 --> 01:19:31.68 But it was so bad bro
01:19:31.68 --> 01:19:35.20 Even the next day the guy came we call him was like get these fucking things out of here
01:19:35.20 --> 01:19:39.76 And I took one of the way to his through it out of the floor over the railing outside pieces shit
01:19:40.32 --> 01:19:43.28 I mean a kid could make it look like a kid school thing
01:19:44.08 --> 01:19:48.48 So the next night we just went with a flat curtain red curtain and uh
01:19:49.20 --> 01:19:52.40 And we carpeted the stage was just a little interesting. I've never done that
01:19:52.40 --> 01:19:59.20 It's just a little bit kind of explosive to take the reflection off of the stage so it would give us a better lighting out some better lighting opportunities
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:04.80 And then they record them all and they recorded them all yeah and then you
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:11.12 Depending on which night you did the best you might take a chunk from here and a chunk from there. That's pretty much how you put it together
01:20:11.12 --> 01:20:14.72 It pretty much about and you know we just did like two-thirds from one show and one third from another
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:19.44 The crowd was much better the second night. We had to get the tell the people have security
01:20:19.44 --> 01:20:24.72 You know or just have some control over the audience and people wanted to be helpful, you know
01:20:25.44 --> 01:20:27.44 And also the
01:20:28.88 --> 01:20:33.12 Netflix hit us a couple days before and said everybody has to have a test or a PCR
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:35.76 You know or whatever
01:20:35.76 --> 01:20:38.56 PPCR yeah so that was
01:20:39.92 --> 01:20:45.12 And I'm just grateful to everybody that came out whether they got a test or made a fake car wherever the hell they did
01:20:45.12 --> 01:20:51.28 And a lot of people went and got the test man and it just it's just so nice you know
01:20:52.64 --> 01:20:57.76 It just it just was it's just so nice to go spend an extra half hour the day before you're gonna go to a show
01:20:58.56 --> 01:21:01.04 Could go and do something because you care enough man
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:04.000 Yeah

01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:12.72 We're looking at a video. They ever have this to you dude. I will stay far away from them
01:22:12.72 --> 01:22:13.52 Even then
01:22:13.52 --> 01:22:15.76 She that no beautiful ladies was nice to see
01:22:16.40 --> 01:22:20.64 Obviously they love you and it was just nice to see a little part of your life man. It made me feel
01:22:20.96 --> 01:22:26.24 It's just inspiring you know when I see other people doing the things that are like seeing like the hardest thing for me to do
01:22:26.64 --> 01:22:29.84 To build from our future. It's like every time you see it like
01:22:30.64 --> 01:22:31.84 It just
01:22:31.84 --> 01:22:35.60 It makes things feel a little bit more feasible or that I know if I need help
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:39.28 I can ask you or I can ask other people that I know care so
01:22:39.92 --> 01:22:44.24 It was it was nice. I appreciate you coming now. Well, it's definitely feasible. Who's a great show?
01:22:44.56 --> 01:22:47.04 Appreciate you being out there. Appreciate you making everyone laugh
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:51.36 I can already see we're gonna have to do this again. We have a little bit more time. Yeah, with low-to-home
01:22:51.36 --> 01:22:54.80 Sorry I have to go I'm thinking five hours next time but what I do I don't know
01:22:56.40 --> 01:23:00.56 I don't know man, but we got live I would love to talk more about the stuff and talk more about
01:23:00.56 --> 01:23:06.24 Um, other things hopefully I have some more BJJ training when I come back so that would be something nice to talk about
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:11.28 Awesome man. Let's get you out of here brother. Echo. Thank you nice to meet you brother. Yeah, you too. Oh, you said it, huh?
01:23:11.84 --> 01:23:13.28 The
01:23:13.28 --> 01:23:20.40 You know how you thought you mentioned her like you'll run into people and you'll actually have like a little bit of a connection with them
01:23:21.04 --> 01:23:23.04 Is do you think that
01:23:23.76 --> 01:23:27.92 Like you know how you share stuff openly more than a lot of people I think
01:23:27.92 --> 01:23:31.52 Do you think that that is an indicator that you're doing the right thing?
01:23:33.52 --> 01:23:37.52 Because sometimes like okay, so let's say if you're in the public like
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:44.32 And people will approach or whatever I think sometimes they can like miss represent who you are
01:23:44.32 --> 01:23:48.72 They're like oh, yeah, maybe like they feel like they know you got a podcast all this stuff and then when they
01:23:49.12 --> 01:23:54.88 The things they say or they try to like relate to you whatever the like they're just way off a lot of the time I think
01:23:54.88 --> 01:24:02.48 Not not necessarily my sometimes it can be you know, but the fact that like a random quote and quote random stranger can come up to you
01:24:02.48 --> 01:24:06.40 And then you guys can relate like on a significant like kind of deep level
01:24:06.40 --> 01:24:12.40 It's just so quickly get there. That's one thing that's fascinating. I mean you could have a moment where you're having a real moment with somebody
01:24:12.64 --> 01:24:15.44 Like a moment that makes you feel something inside of yourself
01:24:16.24 --> 01:24:17.44 You know
01:24:17.44 --> 01:24:20.16 And that's real that that to me comes from somewhere else
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:29.12 Yeah, it always like you always struck me as someone who's like so authentic and I think that that that is a big indicator that you're doing the right thing
01:24:29.12 --> 01:24:33.60 If you can really like relate to people who you never met before that quickly
01:24:35.20 --> 01:24:43.04 Yeah, thanks man. Uh, yeah, I just I think for feeling so disc it's a lot of it's so new to me feeling connection
01:24:43.04 --> 01:24:47.04 And so it's fucking like being on a bridge at shakes, you know
01:24:47.04 --> 01:24:52.64 I don't know what you guys call that and you know, we usually call that a bridge the shake
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:57.20 Yeah, but if we do say that sounds people are technical
01:24:57.68 --> 01:24:59.68 It's telling people believe it, okay
01:25:00.32 --> 01:25:04.32 Um, but yeah, for me a lot of that stuff is just I'm a late
01:25:05.12 --> 01:25:09.36 I'm a late bloomer and a lot of like kind of I think emotional kind of ways honestly
01:25:10.80 --> 01:25:12.80 And I'm not ashamed of it or anything like that
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:17.12 You know, um, but it's not on's in a world where you want to be tougher
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:20.88 You know, it's it's uh, it feels
01:25:21.92 --> 01:25:24.88 It feels tough to sometimes learn later in life
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:27.84 But yeah, I think it's nice and sometimes I don't know what
01:25:29.04 --> 01:25:31.04 Roll God is using me for you know
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.88 You know and I just want to try and keep myself the best
01:25:36.48 --> 01:25:40.48 In the best way that I can so he can use me for the best, you know like um
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:46.56 And I really I really believe that, you know, and I don't mean it in a way like I'm some kind of hero or anything
01:25:46.56 --> 01:25:48.56 I just
01:25:48.80 --> 01:25:52.80 You know if I can take care of myself well, I believe and I believe this for anybody that he that
01:25:53.52 --> 01:25:58.96 Or you aren't your higher power doesn't it could be whatever your higher power is can use you for good, you know
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:03.44 And we need more good out there and we need each other, you know
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:06.72 Anyway, I sound like a fucking weirdo dog. Do I sound like a weirdo?
01:26:06.72 --> 01:26:12.88 Kind of okay. Sorry. You mean you go? No man. I think I think I think I go spot on it's kind of kind of mimics or or
01:26:13.52 --> 01:26:19.44 Reinforces what I was saying earlier. I think the reason that you're popular right now is because you
01:26:19.84 --> 01:26:25.68 Review yourself because you're open and I think people you're you're real person and I think people connect to that and
01:26:25.92 --> 01:26:30.000 And I think it's awesome because I think it allows people to connect to themselves
01:26:30.48 --> 01:26:32.08 So I say
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:36.08 Keep doing what you're doing. Theo Vaughn. I appreciate a man and I appreciate you guys have me man
01:26:36.08 --> 01:26:40.56 I really do it's good. It's made me feel excited like I'm doing the right thing. I don't know bro gang maybe
01:26:42.56 --> 01:26:44.56 And with that
01:26:44.56 --> 01:26:47.36 Mr. Theo Vaughn has left the building. Yes
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:50.56 He had to go bad planning on my part
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:55.28 He had a tight window. I should have gotten him in here earlier
01:26:55.92 --> 01:26:57.76 Didn't didn't make that adjustments. We had a bail
01:26:58.80 --> 01:27:02.24 But we're gonna back he's fired up to come back
01:27:02.24 --> 01:27:06.08 Seems like we were just kind of getting into some good stuff. You know so
01:27:08.32 --> 01:27:10.32 With that it is good that Theo
01:27:11.60 --> 01:27:17.84 Is you know he's on the path he's working trying to get better trying to be better trying to stay on the path sober
01:27:18.24 --> 01:27:20.24 Clean fitness
01:27:20.24 --> 01:27:23.04 What was he talking about yoga like the whole nine yards?
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:30.48 Some self assessment going on self assessment happening. There was some good stuff in there actually that he just sort of like mentioned
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:32.48 Yeah, and I was like wait wait wait
01:27:33.60 --> 01:27:41.12 We could talk what I didn't want to interrupt obviously, but there's um when he mentioned the thing about your behavior in your thoughts
01:27:41.84 --> 01:27:45.04 Like your thoughts and actions. Yeah, so your actions
01:27:45.84 --> 01:27:52.72 Lead your thoughts your thoughts. Yeah, yeah, yeah the other way around doesn't doesn't I would say if I was to assess that statement
01:27:53.68 --> 01:27:55.68 I agree
01:27:55.68 --> 01:27:57.68 Your actions can lead to your thoughts
01:27:57.68 --> 01:28:02.24 I would say more often than your thoughts lead to actions because let's face it
01:28:02.48 --> 01:28:09.02 Gotta have some thoughts to come up with what you're gonna do. Yeah, but there's a huge huge
01:28:09.92 --> 01:28:11.20 Space
01:28:11.20 --> 01:28:13.52 Between having a thought and taking action
01:28:13.52 --> 01:28:16.16 You can close up that space you're gonna meet a lot better position
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:21.56 Yeah, and he and it felt like you talk about so many very specific like like basically
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.36 It's essentially like take action, you know, yeah
01:28:25.36 --> 01:28:32.72 Rather than just going around in your head and Tim Ferris, I think yeah, Tim Ferris said that too
01:28:32.72 --> 01:28:37.92 We're essentially the different way to say it, but the exact same thing is like get out of your head and into your body
01:28:37.92 --> 01:28:42.56 Yeah, and he meant and Tim mentioned that specifically around like getting out of depression
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:44.88 But then what feel is saying is if he's not
01:28:45.84 --> 01:28:48.16 Physically moving and doing work physically
01:28:48.16 --> 01:28:53.28 He's gonna be in a bad place mentally. So yeah, you're right to say same thing same thing same cake
01:28:53.28 --> 01:28:55.28 It's for sure
01:28:55.28 --> 01:28:59.60 Unless there's a lot of stuff. Yes, you can follow up on the Wii. I can follow up on with you
01:29:00.24 --> 01:29:03.52 And I will be looking forward to that nonetheless in the meantime
01:29:03.92 --> 01:29:08.000 But we're all on this path together. I think I feel like it. I feel like we're all sort of
01:29:08.88 --> 01:29:12.32 When we look up we see other people on the path with us
01:29:13.12 --> 01:29:15.36 Good feeling it's good feeling so
01:29:16.72 --> 01:29:18.72 I was doing some thinking
01:29:18.72 --> 01:29:20.72 about the
01:29:20.72 --> 01:29:28.32 These okay, so you when you created juggle fuel you essentially made the path pretty luxurious
01:29:28.56 --> 01:29:33.28 Because think of only you can think about like how it was versus how it is now right? Yeah, okay
01:29:34.40 --> 01:29:37.36 I mean, yes, you are right. Yeah, maybe luxury
01:29:37.36 --> 01:29:41.04 Series is not my favorite word. No, I know you maybe have that lingering in your brain from
01:29:41.60 --> 01:29:45.68 Theo von being on here because he and I had had a conversation on his podcast about
01:29:45.68 --> 01:29:54.48 Luxury days, right? Yeah, okay, so the the way to put it as far as how you called it one time couple times
01:29:54.48 --> 01:30:02.56 I was efficient. Yeah, it's exactly right like it's kind of like the logistics part of a of a battle or a war or something right where it's like
01:30:03.60 --> 01:30:09.92 Oh, yeah, you want these cool new shoes that comfort your feet or whatever. I don't know that's for
01:30:09.92 --> 01:30:16.96 For example, I think of but you're like no, it's not that I need to be coddled my feet like my feet are in good shape
01:30:17.20 --> 01:30:19.68 But I can do a lot more running lot more rocking
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:30.32 Lot more marching. Yep, seems same so you're you kind of took that approach. Yeah to the path you'll be more efficient even though technically speaking to support your
01:30:31.52 --> 01:30:32.56 perspective
01:30:32.56 --> 01:30:34.16 if you have
01:30:34.16 --> 01:30:36.56 good boots for
01:30:36.56 --> 01:30:38.56 rocking yeah
01:30:38.56 --> 01:30:43.28 They are technically will make you more efficient and in some way
01:30:43.68 --> 01:30:50.16 That is somewhat luxurious compared to a piece of junk boots that are or bare feet or bare feet even down
01:30:50.32 --> 01:30:51.92 but
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:56.64 One could think of it in terms of all this is gonna these bare feet is gonna make my feet tougher
01:30:57.92 --> 01:30:59.92 When you say one could think of it
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:07.60 Is that cousin high school there they're telling you you shouldn't use you the proverbial humor in a sentence
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:09.60 It's
01:31:09.60 --> 01:31:11.60 Sure, yeah, I
01:31:11.60 --> 01:31:17.20 Think I got it from flight club actually to be honest. What do they say in flight club? I think he said on the plane
01:31:17.20 --> 01:31:20.64 He said one could make all types of explosives using
01:31:22.16 --> 01:31:27.52 Ordinary household items and then the other guy said really if one were so inclined
01:31:29.44 --> 01:31:31.44 So it's like I'm not saying me
01:31:31.44 --> 01:31:40.56 Okay, I'm saying me, but I'm not saying well it's interesting. That's where you got cuz I went to college and I studied English in college and you you aren't supposed you
01:31:41.76 --> 01:31:43.76 aren't supposed to say
01:31:44.48 --> 01:31:48.40 This is you should do this or you should do that you are supposed to say
01:31:49.04 --> 01:31:53.92 One should say one is supposed to this. Oh, so right right. I don't know to me it
01:31:54.48 --> 01:32:00.96 It's the language evolves. Yep English evolves and I think we're evolving to a point and I think I evolved to a point
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:03.84 Where I say you right and I mean you you
01:32:05.04 --> 01:32:07.60 Yeah, so in that that's actually good. Okay
01:32:08.56 --> 01:32:10.56 That's kind of a good point
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:15.44 In general because Ben and I said this before where it's it's baffling
01:32:16.48 --> 01:32:20.40 How good we can communicate, but when you think about this all kind of this is the words you say the tone
01:32:20.64 --> 01:32:24.16 Byling of like all this stuff is all command a certain message so if you're like hey
01:32:24.56 --> 01:32:27.76 You'll tell you what you should do is do this and then there's all kinds of
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:33.68 Like things that you imply when you say you you don't really mean you should do this
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:39.36 You mean you mean a person should do this or whatever and I know that but if I don't know that
01:32:39.68 --> 01:32:44.32 I'll be like tell me what I should you don't know what I should and shouldn't do so there's a I
01:32:45.20 --> 01:32:49.36 You have you specifically aquatronics have a really good point and that's why
01:32:50.24 --> 01:32:52.24 The English language
01:32:52.24 --> 01:32:59.20 Technically in the highest level you should be I should be saying one should be saying one instead of you
01:33:00.80 --> 01:33:02.80 So if one
01:33:04.24 --> 01:33:07.12 I don't even know if he's all right, right there for how to negate
01:33:07.28 --> 01:33:12.24 Geminate up anyway if you're on the path with you know whether you with somebody on the path or by yourself
01:33:12.24 --> 01:33:14.24 Where you feel like you by yourself
01:33:14.48 --> 01:33:17.44 It's not always gonna be easy and to make you more efficient
01:33:18.32 --> 01:33:20.32 we're gonna decrease
01:33:20.32 --> 01:33:21.84 the beatings
01:33:21.84 --> 01:33:25.28 Increase the recovery so we can maximize gains
01:33:25.76 --> 01:33:28.80 Best way I can put it at this point gains with Z
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:35.12 Sure the soul modern English okay, so in muscle building right
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:37.92 You have the catabolic state. Yes, me and I mean
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:45.20 You have the anabolic state right catabolic essentially there's a lot to it, but is the breakdown muscle
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000 rest nutrition
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:56.000 induces an anabolic state right we want to upside we want to maximize anabolic state on this path
01:33:57.20 --> 01:33:59.04 Catabolic stays part of the process as well
01:33:59.44 --> 01:34:06.88 But that trans transition from catabolic to anabolic we want that to be the luxury we want that to be the efficient part of it
01:34:07.76 --> 01:34:11.84 Am I right catabolic no brab animal catapulka's bad
01:34:11.84 --> 01:34:17.76 You go okay, there was a funny guy in one of my cartoons where when he would get hungry
01:34:17.76 --> 01:34:21.92 You know he'd be walking dude we need to go get some food and go and catapulka right now
01:34:22.32 --> 01:34:26.96 One of those that's why I said let's read the back out all right well either way
01:34:27.52 --> 01:34:29.52 We got some stuff for you all right so jockel feel
01:34:30.40 --> 01:34:36.88 Just talk about this one the energy drink new era new era of energy drink we no longer have to pay a price
01:34:36.88 --> 01:34:43.04 For enjoying energy drinks positivity good taste stain positive

01:34:55.52 --> 01:35:02.78 Normally everything has a trade off here no trade off right just put pure upside pure upside kind of like such salmon sashimi
01:35:03.12 --> 01:35:04.40 Pure upside
01:35:04.40 --> 01:35:10.000 Tick good good for you. Oh, you're better off good free bring. Yeah. Yeah, the whole period upside so yes
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:12.96 In the can
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:17.60 Mango okay, this is my opinion okay, I'll admit mango is the best one straight up
01:35:19.60 --> 01:35:21.20 factually
01:35:21.20 --> 01:35:23.68 factually in my opinion yeah, all right either way
01:35:24.40 --> 01:35:27.52 Either way, we're also free joint stuff you you don't want to have to worry about your joints
01:35:27.52 --> 01:35:34.16 Joint where for super-crile oil also vitamin D and cold waters for your immunity
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:39.60 So look when you consider that these things are taking care of on this path you are more efficient
01:35:39.84 --> 01:35:43.84 More healthy more efficient mental physical boost and as you normally point out these are things
01:35:43.84 --> 01:35:47.12 You don't want to have to worry about correct. You don't want to be thinking about your joints
01:35:47.52 --> 01:35:52.72 You don't want to be thinking about getting sick. Yep. You just you want that stuff to be handled handle handle it
01:35:52.88 --> 01:35:54.16 Does handle it?

01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:03.12 Speaking of anabolic protein. It's probably nutrition profile of gains as it were
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:10.48 So moke a discerr protein informed of a desert another one of these up when win win scenarios
01:36:10.48 --> 01:36:17.52 No doubt upside taste good. All this stuff is good. Exactly good good for you just upside across the board

01:38:11.76 --> 01:38:16.80 Yeah, speaking of upside so I do have my first pair of Delta 68 jeans
01:38:17.52 --> 01:38:21.68 Finally realized. Yeah, so here's what that did with the you know you know how like you
01:38:22.32 --> 01:38:26.24 What you call when you build something up in your mind finally when it comes you have this you know
01:38:26.64 --> 01:38:31.28 Did it measure up or did it not you have the high expectations yep? So did it measure up here's the thing
01:38:31.92 --> 01:38:38.24 They do measure up in fact they more than measure up because you know how like you'll say okay they kind of have a stretch
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:44.72 Tom cool they have a stretch to them but why not since I don't really have any stretchy jeans
01:38:45.28 --> 01:38:49.76 Or any jeans with a stretch to them I don't really know that even means one I put them on you know
01:38:51.28 --> 01:38:52.32 What it's nice
01:38:52.64 --> 01:39:00.08 It's good. It's like in fact it's hard to go back now. No, there is no going back. It's insane. Yeah, so yeah, dang impressive
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:05.28 I didn't know so much could go into I knew stuff goes into jeans. I understand what's weird
01:39:05.28 --> 01:39:10.000 You it's hard to understand how much better something could be yes it's hard to imagine if you don't know
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:14.80 You just don't know you just hard to imagine how much better they can be than a normal pair of jeans
01:39:14.80 --> 01:39:21.12 Yeah, and again to be made in America with American cotton you know an American buttons
01:39:22.40 --> 01:39:25.60 American hands as a American hands exactly right
01:39:25.92 --> 01:39:29.20 So yeah, or do you know say calm that's the spot right there also
01:39:29.20 --> 01:39:35.52 Jocquoise store it's called jocquoise store so you go to jocquoise store.com and this is where you can get
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:45.68 Trying to think of a more interesting way to properly convey the cool stuff you can get but at the end of the day you can just get your t-shirts
01:39:46.32 --> 01:39:48.32 hats hoodies
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:50.32 represent the path
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:56.40 I think that's the best way to put it just clean equals freedom good take the high ground or the high ground will take you
01:39:56.40 --> 01:39:58.88 Some good
01:39:58.88 --> 01:39:59.84 That's a t-shirt
01:39:59.84 --> 01:40:03.12 Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey subscribe to this podcast
01:40:04.08 --> 01:40:08.80 And we also have some other podcast got jockel unraveling with Darryl Cooper we got the ground new podcast
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:14.16 We got the warrior kid podcast. Theo Vaughan has a podcast check it out. It's called this past weekend
01:40:14.96 --> 01:40:18.16 And he talks about stuff and it's both funny and
01:40:18.96 --> 01:40:20.96 Revealing and
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:27.52 Could help you I like listening to it so check that one out. We're um, and Carrie were talking
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000 During the break and where at Theo has this
01:40:31.36 --> 01:40:34.32 It's pretty unique quality about him where
01:40:35.28 --> 01:40:44.08 He's like funny, but he's so authentic and open about that even not so funny parts of you know and I think some people they'll try to do this and they'll try to like
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:51.68 Like quote unquote pull it off, but they lack the full authenticity so they try and pull off the authenticity
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:56.72 Yes, and which is kind of a what he call a catch 22 like if you're trying to pull off authenticity
01:40:56.72 --> 01:41:00.08 That's not enough itself makes it not a thing. Yeah exactly right, but
01:41:00.56 --> 01:41:06.72 Theo is like a naturally what seems natural like he's a naturally authentic person it sounds like from what you're saying though
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:10.56 He wasn't always like that and he had to sort of open up about it over time
01:41:10.56 --> 01:41:15.76 Okay, so and this is what we're talking about where a lot of times where if you have the
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:18.80 Being funny to people
01:41:19.20 --> 01:41:22.88 Legitimately is it's kind of like a superpower like
01:41:23.76 --> 01:41:30.08 You can essentially best still one of the best feelings on to a person and make them laugh right that's one of the best feelings
01:41:30.08 --> 01:41:34.96 You can ever have is like laughing legitimately and you have that as a superpower
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:37.60 You're just a funny person right so a lot of people
01:41:37.60 --> 01:41:42.96 Whether they have like internal issues or not that starts to become the the front running
01:41:43.60 --> 01:41:48.32 Quality where they're always pushing that forward. You know, they're always leading with that leading with that
01:41:48.56 --> 01:41:50.32 And it's always successful
01:41:50.32 --> 01:41:53.76 Meanwhile the other stuff on the inside gets protected
01:41:54.08 --> 01:41:58.40 You know, so anytime someone feels awkward or anytime someone feels vulnerable
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:04.08 Even scared or whatever anything that they don't like they can just boom they can bust out the comedy and
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:08.88 And they'll be protected in fact they'll get a payoff from it. They won't just be protected. You know
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:14.24 But after a while the stuff on the inside becomes more and more sensitive, you know
01:42:14.56 --> 01:42:20.28 Where if it even if it's exposed this much it's like well the reaction is a little bit a lot stronger, you know
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:25.52 But Theo does a good job in like opening up and exposing that a little bit
01:42:25.76 --> 01:42:31.20 And at the end of the day as an audience while I'm speaking for myself. It's kind of like you just like him more
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:37.76 Yeah, no, he's a very like bogey and he part of the reason that he's like bulls because he is like that like what you're saying and he I even
01:42:38.16 --> 01:42:40.64 But last night I went and saw him do his
01:42:41.20 --> 01:42:44.24 Do a comedy stand-up routine. Is that what it's called?
01:42:46.08 --> 01:42:50.72 Why so I'm doing it and what's cool is like you could see he's not
01:42:52.32 --> 01:42:54.32 Like he's
01:42:54.88 --> 01:42:56.08 He's
01:42:56.08 --> 01:43:02.48 Real up there like he's saying something. He'd like I don't know I'm saying you know that means I don't know what I'm saying. He did that a couple times today
01:43:02.48 --> 01:43:05.28 I don't even know what I'm talking about right now. He did that a couple times really
01:43:05.28 --> 01:43:06.88 There go okay well
01:43:06.88 --> 01:43:12.16 At least we know that we're getting the real real person. Yeah, it's not just a big memorized script that you know
01:43:13.12 --> 01:43:15.36 Where it's all a big front
01:43:15.36 --> 01:43:22.24 Yeah, right we don't want the front. Yeah, like a lot of times if you're just talking with your friend and you go off on some tangent or something
01:43:22.24 --> 01:43:28.32 That's the kind of stuff you're gonna say to your friend you know or your friends behind closed doors, you know just like in your own little environment
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:33.48 But yeah, I should sometimes I don't know what I'm talking about you know, but he's like so open with that and I don't mean
01:43:33.48 --> 01:43:37.68 Open like he's like making this huge effort to be open
01:43:37.68 --> 01:43:39.92 You just naturally it's like yeah
01:43:40.72 --> 01:43:43.68 Good guy man. I've spent some time with him and
01:43:44.08 --> 01:43:50.12 Definitely a really good authentic nice funny guy man. I really like him a lot
01:43:50.12 --> 01:43:52.12 I'm glad he was able to come on
01:43:52.52 --> 01:43:57.000 You know another podcast that there is out there. It's called jacca owner ground calm

01:44:01.72 --> 01:44:04.84 contingencies happening where the world goes crazy
01:44:05.88 --> 01:44:09.000 Because that's basically the world's getting a little crazy right now
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.12 Let's say it gets crazy or and they either start
01:44:12.92 --> 01:44:18.04 I don't know maybe they start injecting advertisements into the middle of this podcast or they start maybe they start
01:44:18.04 --> 01:44:22.12 Banting parts of this podcast. I don't know what they're gonna do
01:44:22.12 --> 01:44:25.88 I do know this right now everyone's being pretty cool to us
01:44:26.36 --> 01:44:31.000 But there might come a time where they where they say hey, we don't want you to do that or we you're gonna follow our rules
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000 So we have a contingency
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.32 In the event that that happens we have a place to go jacca owner ground calm
