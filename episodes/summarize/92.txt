You know, you just piling all that other stuff onto, and it just like you said, you lost your legs, and you're like, oh, that's pretty much what a guy like me, I focus, oh, he lost his legs, obviously freaking horrible, and then you don't, a guy like me, I'm not thinking about all these other injuries that you're sustaining, and all the medical things that have to happen to get that stuff straightened out. And then I recall for the first couple of weeks, every now and then, I don't know, I had a discredit with something what happened, you felt explosions before, and there's kind of that when the shockwave goes through you, and you kind of feel your brain kind of jar a little bit, I would kind of fuel that, and then for a split second, I would kind of, it would be like I was getting hit by an explosion for a split second, like that. They're like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're like skinny jeans. You know, in there like, this hurts, you know, and I, you know, this is, this is through, you know, repair something, like I had a hernioporace, where I had a neck surgery. But like, how you said, like, if you don't think, like, if you think, oh, yeah, that kind of can't be done. I mean, like, hey, we were kind of talking about the call over here, just like sick humor that you end up with in the military because you have to take that thought, which is in your head, like it's got to be in your head. They were like, they were like, they were like, they woke up like so early in the morning. I remember they, you can only hit the, it'll only let you hit it every three, four or five minutes or something like that, and they would come in during the first little bit, and they would say, you know, you can only hit that thing like 12 times in a minute, right? You know, they're like, they're like, they're like, that's what the passion thing though. I'm like, well, I'd be, because I'd be kind of like falling asleep, and then I'd hit it, and doing, oh, make sure I make sure I got that hit, and so I'd just hit it again, and so yeah, and then, but eventually kind of get used to it, and then pain starts to go away. Because yeah, when I said it morphed into, I was thinking like back, you know, must have been sometime in World War II where they said, you know, okay, we're going to get over this river. They said, I'm never, I don't know what that is, but luckily it went away, and after maybe it had something to do with the drugs, I don't know, but, yeah, but you know, eventually you get used to that, and body kind of gets adapted to it, and you get your senses back, and it's hard to look at a computer screen for the first couple of weeks still, but eventually I would see ants crawling on me. You know, he's the kind where I'm like, okay, just need like the shots. So, but that, you know, that makes me kind of like, like mental after shockwave. And he rolled out like that like it was like it was the deal. A guy asked about Jiu Jitsu belts and said, you know, I understand that you shouldn't pursue because in Jiu Jitsu, it's like, hey, you shouldn't just like go to get a belt. So that, I mean, I can't, like, what you have is like a thousand times, a thousand times worse, and it's hard to even imagine, and then on top of this, I'm going back to the journal here to top it off. And so we did managed to get a month long school of, you know, just doing demolition, refreshment, more IED stuff, patrol practice, you know, just doing all sorts of training like that. But I would say, so you're like, now, every patrol that you guys are going out is like, hey, now, how often are you finding IEDs at this point? Whenever the physical therapist couldn't come in and do her stuff with me, I was like, oh, I want this going to do, I'm going to pull myself up on this thing. Like, you know, like a brush you find under your sink or whatever, put some water in. I was like, you know what might be fun is just like riding my bike across the country. Like when you roll out, you know how like if you have and not that it's even a big deal. And I was like, I was like, these, I don't know how I look cause they didn't have a mirror in the cabin. You know, martial arts geese or whatever, but he brings like this added like element to it. So the pants are like thereby like sizes, you know, you were 36. And he went in and literally bought a loom for like, I think that I think was like 3000. It's sure it's like, due to it, so you just got to, it doesn't matter if you're doing like a, in a fake, fake scenario, you have, it doesn't really have the same effect unless you're doing it in the real thing. But they had a better idea and they would say, look, you know, you're going to get over there and you're going to get your prosthetics and you're going to be able to walk again. I think like weight lifting and exercising in general, like, the perfect analogy for most things. So then you guys roll in and the, like the broad strategies you're going to start moving from patrol base, you're going to push out, take another compound, secure it, and then operate out of there for a while and then push it on. That's like one of those exercises that you if you learn that the form, it's like the added element because you got to learn the form. And they feel like kind of like normal pants. Yeah, I think I've often, like, trying to wonder why they say, you know, laughter is the best medicine and why it's so true. But that was when they were like, people were shooting at each other in the corn field, like five feet away. When you get back from Afghanistan, I was like, yeah, except you're going to be pulling me on a Rickshaw because I'm going to have both my legs blown off. It's like kind of taste like tea. I mean, most, I'll, many guys just, hey, you know, especially you're sitting in a turret, or yeah, like load me up. And there's gotta be like, you had to have known, or you know this is a possibility, right? So if you want to try and be like anybody, it's be like Dan. Well, you know, for everyone that's come on and sit here and have you, you know, that to have you and the people that have come on this podcast and have you sitting across the table from me and be able to spend time with you yesterday and hang out with you. I think it's on like the history channel or something like that.
