Yeah, I know like the even if it like again go back to everyone being stoic Right, it'd be like it'd be reduced It would be less of a show and in fact you might even argue that it's kind of has as We've seen that before like in just like other like you ever watch like like a Crati tournament or something like that. Oh, yeah, your your chances of success especially as time goes on go go way down But most people if they're like primarily striking or striking is there kind of their their success You know, that's what gives them success they have to learn even like a Few fundamentals in grappling and get really good at them just defensively to start with but if you don't know anything Like if you know how to defend the take down that's grappling right there yeah a big one is like Keep your ears like open, you know, don't don't be that guy like you always say this word don't be the guy Be like what if I just do this you know kind of they like what it does more if you just go in to solicitor Just listen and we've totally had to like get access to the restaurant after hours and like all this stuff Schedule with Kenny not to mention who is like you know this is like after he crossed over into straight-up mainstream You can't just get Kenny Florian off of you know he had chosen like he's kind of a high level guy at this time but that's that's literally life That's like why that's why you want to watch it because of the big part of it is because of the job Chill son and wise man right said one time once one fight ends That's when the promotion for the next fight begins so that you know when he gets on the mic after the fight is done He's essentially promoting the next one and but and the thing is it's totally proven like you even like Someone saying why do you kid why like people coming to you see why are you supporting Connor? and So these guys are just basically punching each other in the face Any other in the face bleeding like all over you know like super bloody the kind of where they got to stop the fight And like hey doctor check this guy that you know, so he gives you a doctor. Yeah, or they incapacitate them as bad as you know something I said on when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast I was like if you go watch when any of those other sports when they escalate They escalate to what you actually want to see which is MMA Like what happens when a basketball game gets a little too rough they fight each other What happens when hockey gets a little bit today fight each other what happens when football gets a little bit too rough They fight even baseball someone someone does something out alive and baseball they fight each other right like I like hey just like no this is just gonna be What is gonna be playing if I was if I was in charge of the entire UFC What would it look like and it would probably just be? I wish was maybe a little bit more into it, you know Like what should I do or so or whatever maybe not even that they just said Like you jump in there You know, so it's like it's because a lot of times And there was two like immediate thoughts behind that was number one like, hey, you know, first of all, we lost our bros like there nothing lucky about that was the first immediate thought in my head was like, hey man. You know, that, you know, that actually, when we came, when tasking a bruiser came home from Iraq, there was, you know, people like all he got super lucky on that deployment because we got a lot of action, right? and you can tell Brad that guys like every time I did stuff with chelsoon video watch right and put like full on accommodating like come like overly polite person in ways that he doesn't have to do that You don't have to do this polite stuff. He was sitting there like hey, all right That's a bummer and Kabib got nuts for those moments and I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what's gonna happen in terms of I know they didn't they But he's not like like bisming will actively just like chelsoon and just like a T or T they'll actively play the bad guy Just a little bit but to the point where they will be categorized is that Like even as much as like a year ago, it was like, oh, this guy got this crazy heal hook in the guy tapped and you didn't know what was happening. Yeah, I'm gonna tell you and I won't be annoyed at all if you tell me if you say it to me like you just Uncovered the secret key of jitzu I'm gonna be slightly annoyed you won't know it, but I'll just be like oh, yeah, well here you go Here's what you do. and you know those obviously like a quote I'm called branding play you know we want to kind of go mainstream with the sport edge of it, and you know Make it a kind of a whole So I see Some white belt blow them in the chain of commands going all crazy grabbing their sleeve and this Leader on the top like it gets concerned about it and puts time and effort into something that doesn't matter Whether it's a little personality rub a little ego uprising It's like should we do it this way or should we do it that way doesn't matter that's a little sleeve grab it doesn't matter That's gonna help you a lot but that's grappling now what if you Essentially fail at defending the take down meaning you get taken down you have to learn to get back up If you don't you'll get held down they're straight up if you don't like take a big strong guy and just a normal size person When I know you do put the big strong guy on his back like even in guard Yeah, what other thing is like that the kids want to have it as bad as the parents because like the kids want ice cream They want it bad the kids the parents don't want to grab it. no way I got parents to say their kids say don't know warrior kid won't do that Like when they read warrior kid their voice goes from like hey dad. You know, like, you know, some guy goes on the news, right with his baskets that he makes, you know, whatever. Yeah, moke is good protein on the one not tell you what now we just came out with Warrior kid moke and Did the right thing and and truly this is Awesome and I'll tell you why it's awesome because kids need good food kids need healthy food and they're not gonna Eat healthy food if it tastes like junk and You know they can keep going you know when you gas and was this bowl going to kind of what your strategy was If a grappler gases he grappler gases and that goes for anyone in a fight if you gas out your your essentially In effect, but so kind of that aside the the the reason that Pete that it seems like my first time fighting his blue belt I'm 17 years old and he's beating everyone super easy to by the way and these are adults 25 to six years old and he's just beating them so he gets his purple belt right right away Unless he's in one of these situations where they actually make you be blue belt for two years You know sometimes there's that like I think I'd be JJ F does that sometimes competing was anyway and and that's not like that Rare of a story because and even just how our gym is laid out where you know the kids guys is going on Hey, just just look right behind you right now right behind you So you can just let let your kids go. Like yeah, but even in grappling tournaments, the guy will be like, hey, I'm going to go, and I'm going to get this guy in a Rural naked choke, that's what I'm going to do. yeah, very much they very much to compliment what I didn't the whole mental Like curcumin And Criloil this big like massage for your brain and getting everything so anyways So try those those we get great feedback on those all the time also got the discipline which is for pre-mission Nutrition when you need to do something both cognitive and physical we got your back on this one Three scoops. it's it's actually getting printed at this time and In order to pull this off in order to actually know how many books I need to print I think it already looks like I need to print more books because you all ordered a lot of them already so thank you Preorder so that I know what to print and I'm hard to annoy I think that might be starting to annoy me a little bit When people when I'm talking to a big group of people that have never done to you It's before and someone throws out the like Why what if you know what if they just grab your arm right here? This is the first product that I can think of in the world That the kids are gonna want to have it as much as the parents are gonna want them to have it I don't know any other thing like that We didn't like crush ourselves and the work up and try and be the most, you know, prepared we could be and then get overseas and then form relationships with all the conventional forces and do good work for them and continue to, you know, just get go as hard as we could the whole time. and you know He just that's what he's doing because then I look at it the same way I see a guy like bisming a guy like T or T's Who are behind that That front that they put up? Yes, you do anyway, so at school she was like hey, that's the boy he called he calls me liar and Another day he called her a liar every day like that's his name like your liar every day. I want him to lose like if he's fighting a guy Let's like don't know the other guy. Well, you know big publishing companies sometimes Anyways, we all have our dragons to fight and When we fight our dragons well, I don't know maybe sometimes we could use some help Echo sometimes you only know any way that we could Maybe get some help fighting our dragons. whatever So like so if you say something mean to her as like a if another kid says something mean that's something there You know super nice to everybody so a kid called her a liar who Unless they're like straight up Juditzu, background guys, but you know, you know, guys who just have essentially, what you call a free style, yeah, He just calls people liar like I got a good reaction out of it some point Some you know you got a reaction at some point. It's like throwing somebody in the water who can't swim Yeah, and like he can't even tread water now let alone swim he can't tread the try as hard as you can The harder you try the more it's just gonna not work But you teach someone to just tread water. It's it's leadership capital because if I'm investing my leadership capital And you're getting your hand off my sleeve or trying to do it my way instead of your way or trying to keep your ego and check If that's what I'm investing my leadership capital is I have nothing left to invest in the thing that's actually matters Just like if you're a black belt and someone guys grabbing your sleeve and you focus on pulling that and off your whole time You're gonna waste energy and maybe you can give up position because you're cuz you're focused on something that did not matter I wanted to eat with my fam sure tell you and We were talking about we were just talking about food And my daughter was like well, somehow she's like you you just eat like one meal and I think yeah, you know what behind that It's gonna be another guy that's a hard worker that wants to win and take care of his family like Okay, and well We're just watching like oh whatever like actually it's like there have been more eventful fights than this one Yeah, I was like only for kind of the dry ice the fact dry ice effect, right really Like you what do you think I give that the negatron It's like way less, like, what you call, like chaotic. You know like I know I can understand their character outside of the character that they play on TV and The character that they have and maybe that's why for me when I look at Connor and I see all this stuff I look at it They are all made in America by the way Which you know it seems like common knowledge about let's say this is your first introduction to origin main dot Boom now you know Get a geek get a rash guard jump on the path you just to just jump in Anyway, anyway when they when they reach ground meaning adult hood when they reach above ground like the bamboo They just shoot because all their fundamentals are like Diled like And or you know what I think is good about this, when you get some success, you kind of compound that back into your hard work and people start to get on an upward spiral upward mobility towards the top of the success chart because they got a little foothold. Yeah, it's really good because it's like easy when you think about it You're like okay chocolate mint. Yeah, you know I got to ask that the other day is like no Didn't it really make you mad because the story and dichotomy leadership about the patches right the patches it's funny because you get these kids right who really get into it Then they grow up into a dot so the belt system is kind of It's like it's like planting a seed before the the plant goes above ground is a lot that goes on And then one day Mikey noticed a book He opened it up and took a quick look He did that pictures of dragons with things like a snake and all kinds of scary things that made Mikey shake But in the pictures there was a boy too Who didn't look scared but like he knew what to do And even though Mikey was scared indeed he decided that he would give the book a read He opened the first page which he eagerly read So like, you know, I don't know who got discovered. It's a show straight up because if it was just a sport you know what they did for the first time I don't know if you notice as you probably did They had like fog on the on the octagon I mean while we're like okay, you know like whatever Yes, my boy my boy There was you know, we would be cornering people backstage and Duke Louis was always my me is probably doesn't know anything There's probably wouldn't even barely know who I am at all so It is important to realize and to learn to differentiate between things that don't matter and things that do matter And in order to tell the difference between those two things you have to be able to detach and Step back and obviously this is the same thing not just with your jitsu not just with leadership Not just with combat because it's the same thing in combat you're gonna have Things that don't things are happening on the battlefield that don't matter little hey guys moving here instead of there that doesn't matter.
