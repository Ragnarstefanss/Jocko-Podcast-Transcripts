[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 53 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:08] I go. Good evening. At one point, do you quit? At what point do you give in? At what point
[00:00:27] do you surrender? And what is it that makes you surrender? The enemy fatigue hunger.
[00:00:38] First, bitter cold. Who are these men that decide that they will not surrender no matter what?
[00:01:01] What will, what human will do they have? That they decide they are going to fight on no matter
[00:01:14] what they face? Well, I will tell you, these men are men. They're human beings. Like you,
[00:01:33] like me, human beings that decide they are going to fight on despite being surrounded by the
[00:01:39] enemy despite the hunger and the danger and the thirst and the bitter cold. They decide they will not surrender.
[00:01:53] We can find examples of these men throughout history. But one of the four most examples comes from the
[00:02:05] Korean War. In late November and into mid December of 1950, when 30,000 UN troops, mostly American,
[00:02:18] were surrounded by 120,000 communist Chinese forces. And these Americans were attacked,
[00:02:28] by the enemy, and attacked by the bitter freezing cold, and attacked by hunger and fear, and yet they
[00:02:36] would not, and they did not surrender. And tonight we're going to hear from Lieutenant
[00:02:49] in the United States Marine Corps, Joseph R. Owen, who served as a mortar section commander for
[00:02:57] Baker Company, first battalion, seventh Marine Regiment, first Marine Division.
[00:03:04] In his book, we just called colder than hell. And the book starts off with one of the best
[00:03:14] short overviews of the Korean War I've ever read, likely, because it's written by a man who is there.
[00:03:21] A man named General Raymond Davis Ray Davis, who, first of all, he was a battalion commander in
[00:03:31] World War II at the Battle of Pelaloo, awarded the Navy Cross there for leading his men against
[00:03:39] overwhelming Japanese fire in Korea. He was awarded the Medal of Honor,
[00:03:47] as well as two silver stars, a legion of merit, and a bronze star,
[00:03:57] as the commander of first battalion, seventh Marines. And beyond that, he also served
[00:04:06] as the third Marine Division commander in Vietnam in 1969, where he was awarded the Navy
[00:04:12] Distinguished Service Medal and three Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses. So when he speaks,
[00:04:20] I think maybe we should listen. And I'm going to start with that forward
[00:04:27] by General Davis in the book, colder than hell, by Joe Owen. Twice in 1950.
[00:04:46] During the first month of the Korean War of the United States faced military catastrophe,
[00:04:52] both situations occurred because of American errors of diplomacy and faulty intelligence,
[00:04:57] and because our military was not prepared to meet a determined enemy on the battlefield.
[00:05:04] North Korea and China were the enemies that exploited our failings.
[00:05:10] On two occasions, that year they called us by surprise, launching massive attacks first
[00:05:16] against our ally South Korea and then against our own inadequate forces.
[00:05:20] Both times the consequences were devastating. There were tragic numbers of casualties in the ranks
[00:05:28] of our soldiers and Marines, and American prestige worldwide was severely impaired.
[00:05:36] The surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korea with the support of communist China and the
[00:05:41] Soviet Union was virtually invited by the United States and the South Koreans. South Korea was vulnerable.
[00:05:49] Its soldiers were ill-equipped, poorly trained, and improperly deployed.
[00:05:55] The American forces at that time victims of Washington politics and false economies were nearly as bad
[00:06:02] off, following the end of World War II drowned, drawdown. They were in skeletonized formation,
[00:06:11] sadly, untrained and inadequately equipped.
[00:06:14] So there's a little warning for us today.
[00:06:21] Somebody asked me that question. What's your foreign policy? Can you say it in 140 characters?
[00:06:27] Somebody asked me that on Twitter. I answered it in one word. My foreign policy is strength.
[00:06:33] This is why. Back to the book. Moreover, our Secretary of State had proclaimed to the world
[00:06:39] that the Korean Peninsula was outside the area of American vital interests. North Korea, China,
[00:06:46] the Soviet Union, read that message to me that the United States would not defend South Korea
[00:06:50] against outside aggression. South Korea would be theirs for the taking.
[00:06:58] We now know of messages exchanged between Joseph Stalin and the North Korean President
[00:07:04] Kim Il-sung that explored our weakness and concluded that South Korea could be captured in five days.
[00:07:13] Subsequently, the North Koreans launched a sudden and massive invasion.
[00:07:18] Solve the North Korean capital, it's quickly taken, and soon all that country was overrun,
[00:07:23] except for one small pocket around the port of Busan.
[00:07:28] That pocket was formed by American troops.
[00:07:31] On ready as they were, that President Harry Truman hurried into Korean response to the crisis.
[00:07:39] At great sacrifice, these American soldiers with a follow-on brigade of Marines held the
[00:07:44] Busan perimeter long enough to allow forces to assemble for an amphibious assault on In-Chop
[00:07:50] behind the North Korean lines. We recaptured Seoul and the North Koreans were put on the run.
[00:07:57] Fearing in trapmen, they fled back across their border to the North.
[00:08:03] American and South Korean troops were joined by soldiers from other United Nations countries
[00:08:08] and pursued the aggressors deep into North Korea. Our mission was too fold to punish the North Koreans
[00:08:16] and to block the Chinese people's liberation army if it threatened to enter the war.
[00:08:21] Because of a failure of intelligence, however, we were far too late to deter the Chinese.
[00:08:29] They had already positioned vast numbers of been well-trained soldiers in the mountains of North Korea.
[00:08:35] We were soon under heavy attack fighting a numerically superior enemy in unfavorable terrain
[00:08:41] and brutally cold weather. The UN forces predominantly American were chased out of North Korea.
[00:08:48] At the chosen reservoir, where we were outnumbered 10 to 1, the Chinese generals prematurely
[00:08:56] boasted of the destruction of the first Marine division. Yet the opposite happened there.
[00:09:04] Although the Marines were forced to withdraw, we destroyed several Chinese divisions as we
[00:09:09] fought our way to the sea and to escape. Our withdrawal was a successful one but we paid a terrible
[00:09:16] price. Casualties reduced the division to nearly half its strength. The three rifle companies of
[00:09:25] first battalion, seventh Marine regimen, which I was privileged to command and dirt losses of even
[00:09:31] greater proportions. My battalion had been hastily activated in response to President Truman's
[00:09:38] urgent call to action. It was a thrown together rifle company, a collection of
[00:09:44] regulars gathered from Marine Corps posts and stations all over the world and reservists,
[00:09:49] mostly untrained, who were suddenly called from their homes, jobs, schools with only a few days of
[00:09:56] training. They were embarked aboard a ship heading across the Pacific and thrown into combat.
[00:10:05] They had to learn to fight while under fire. Their saving grace was that they were led
[00:10:12] by disciplined officers and NCOs who showed them by upfront example how to fight like Marines.
[00:10:22] Although they suffered casualties that proper preparation would have avoided, they learned
[00:10:27] well and they hardened into fine rifle company. No North Korean or Chinese force ever stop
[00:10:35] them from taking it objective or overcame their position. Let us do all we can to assure that no
[00:10:44] future generation of young Americans need to go to war unprepared as were those heroes who went
[00:10:54] to Korea in 1950. And again that is the forward of the book which was written by General Raymond Davis
[00:11:07] Medal of Honor winner. And like I said, the book is written by Joe Owen Joseph Owen who was
[00:11:17] Marine Corps officer. And let's continue on and now we start here in from Joe Owen.
[00:11:30] They're at Camp Lijoon North Carolina. Nobody at Camp Lijoon had expected a shooting war.
[00:11:36] We know we were ready for one. So they're they're they're just kind of peacetime
[00:11:41] Marines, you know, kind of doing their thing and all of a sudden the North Koreans attack.
[00:11:49] And here we go. They're all sitting around listening to the radio a bunch of Marines.
[00:11:55] The announcer continued more than 2000 Americans military advisors and civilian workers and their
[00:12:00] families are said to be in the path of North Koreans surprise aggression. Their fate is unknown at this
[00:12:06] time. American involvement in the New War is not clear. War yeah! The possibility of American
[00:12:15] Marines in a combat role excited us. So these guys are young. Not all of them. There's there's
[00:12:21] definitely we're going to run into many World War II veterans but the young kids they don't know
[00:12:27] they want to get after it. They're they're fired up. They're so fired up back to the book.
[00:12:31] One story alleged that a commando force of volunteers was forming up for an immediate
[00:12:37] commitment to battle. That one tied up phone lines on the base as we tried to track down the
[00:12:43] commando headquarters in order to volunteer. They're all ready to rock and roll.
[00:12:49] Now then they start seeing what what's beginning to occur.
[00:12:54] They see that we're surrounded. They see that we're kind of getting the North Koreans are getting
[00:12:58] the best if not routing. Back to the book Americans at home were stunned by reports that their
[00:13:04] army, the conqueror of the mighty Germany and Japan only five years before was outnumbered,
[00:13:10] outgunned and out fought by the upstart North Koreans. General MacArthur called for a full
[00:13:17] division of Marines to help him turn back the North Koreans. The Marine Corps welcomed the call
[00:13:24] but we did not have a full division to put in the field. Like all the services the Corps had
[00:13:31] been stripped of men and weapons in order to reduce itself to the level of the 1930s.
[00:13:38] Both the first and second Marine divisions were less than half strength.
[00:13:43] The Corps would need to draw men from guard detachments, ships, companies, and posts and
[00:13:48] stations throughout the world. But it still wouldn't find enough troops to fill a division.
[00:13:55] President Truman thus authorized the common honor of the Marine Corps to call up the reserves.
[00:14:02] So it was again this is a warning. As a nation and as an individual human,
[00:14:11] don't let down your guard. Peace time will not last. And the weaker you look, the sooner
[00:14:21] the peace time will end. Now they get the orders stand by to ship out.
[00:14:30] On the Saturday evening before we left Camp Lijoon, Dorothy. So that's Joe's wife, Dorothy hired a
[00:14:35] babysitter and we went to the officers club for dinner. There were candles out of our table
[00:14:40] which was covered in white linen and set with heavy silverware. The food was delicious and
[00:14:46] plentiful and I would think about it often in Korea when my men and I were hungry and cold.
[00:14:54] That night Dorothy's hair glissoned like gold in the candlelight and her eyes smiled bright and blue
[00:15:01] and warm. We danced and laughed with the other latinants and their wives.
[00:15:07] For some of the couples, our closest friends, it was the last night they would ever have together.
[00:15:19] So they depart Lijoon and they show up at Camp Pendleton California and they get to camp
[00:15:28] Pendleton. We'll talk more about this but Camp Pendleton is a belief in an aunt's on the coast of
[00:15:37] California and there's some pretty aggressive hills in Camp Pendleton which I've spent many
[00:15:44] nights on because we would work up there and they can turn some soft men into some hard men
[00:15:52] pretty quickly or break men if they're too weak. So back to the book our ranks were filled
[00:15:58] by 215 men and seven officers who had never before served together.
[00:16:04] Half of our enlisted men were infantry trained regulars. The other half were a service, most of
[00:16:09] whom were youngsters who knew new little of marine infantry and its method methods.
[00:16:15] Five weeks after we first formed up a camp Pendleton we went into the attack against North Korean
[00:16:22] soldiers who were dug into a hill north of Seoul and we had spent half of that time on board ship
[00:16:30] on the way to war. So let me break that down to you. They have five weeks or five weeks from when they
[00:16:35] form up. Five weeks later they're attacking North Korean troops. So just FYI for a seal platoon that's
[00:16:43] going to Iraq we used to work up for a full year. This is after we went through seal training and
[00:16:49] after we went through seal qualification training and after all the guys show up the team and go
[00:16:53] to special schools and then you get formed up into a platoon and you have an unbelievable work
[00:16:57] up to prepare and the Marine Corps does this too. I mean the army everyone does this now.
[00:17:02] That's the amount of preparation that it takes to prepare for combat. And here are these guys
[00:17:06] five weeks of which what was it. Half that time is spent on a ship just sailing over there.
[00:17:12] Hmm unbelievable. Back to the book the sun scorched hills of Camp Pendleton had over the years
[00:17:24] toughened the legs and tested the spirits of thousands of America's best fighting men.
[00:17:30] One of those towering hills loomed across the road from our training site. So again you want to get
[00:17:36] tough. Get on some hills with a rock sack on your back. That will do it to you. And I guess I kind
[00:17:44] of included those little sections about Camp Pendleton hills for my own pleasure thinking about
[00:17:51] those hills. Back to the book they're going through the training and they're getting ready to
[00:18:00] deploy and we'll go back to the book now Dorothy took 75 dollars of our scant resources and bought
[00:18:07] an airline ticket from Syracuse to San Diego. Each night after we had dismissed the troops,
[00:18:14] Bill and I this is Bill Graber he's another one of the officers. Bill and I caught a ride to the hotel.
[00:18:22] Restaurants in the little village of San Clemente were closed that late but Dorothy would have
[00:18:26] a cold supper waiting for me. Then we would stroll to the beach and listen to the waves crash
[00:18:31] across the sand. During those walks we talked about the babies and we made plans for my return from
[00:18:39] Korea. My next assignment I assure her would give us at least two years at a good duty station.
[00:18:45] Maybe I would be seeing your enough for us to rate decent quarters. In the mornings,
[00:18:51] early and still dark Bill Graber and I would grab a ride back to Camp with the other officers.
[00:18:58] Everyone except the drivers slept all the way crowded against each other and the tight seats of the
[00:19:03] car. We were very tired but we were young men and we did dearly love our beautiful wives.
[00:19:13] And you're going to see throughout this book that even though his wife was not with him,
[00:19:19] she was with him the whole time. Like many spouses are when guys are deployed overseas and now
[00:19:28] they are on board the ship. The ship is getting ready to pull out the San Diego bay.
[00:19:37] Back to the book the wives remained on the dock long after we had gone aboard.
[00:19:41] The squirrel of bagpipe sounded as we wave to them. PFC Timmy Kaleen, Abel Company stood on the
[00:19:49] fan tail of the Oken Augen and his bagpipes filled the fading afternoon with the marines him.
[00:20:00] Hanker chips fluttered from the dock and the ship's horn blasted. We were underway.
[00:20:05] There were tears but marines and marines wives aren't ashamed of tears when their him plays.
[00:20:19] So now they're heading over to Korea. They're in cramped quarters. I've done a couple
[00:20:27] deployments on board ships and there's amphibious ships is what they're called and these ships
[00:20:32] were meant to take people overseas. The ones that I deployed on were what drove us,
[00:20:38] what drove soldiers to Vietnam. We used to deploy on those ships for six months but it's just
[00:20:43] really cramped. They're basically basically like a cattle car, a giant cattle car, a cattle ship.
[00:20:47] Then they just pack everyone on there. It's really tight and there's not much to do on there.
[00:20:54] But you know you take a bunch of marines you put them on a ship and they figure something out
[00:20:58] back to the book. Staff Sergeant Richard revealed himself to be an all-purpose NCO and an acquisition
[00:21:03] specialist. One day he produced a set of boxing gloves and the men of Baker 17 immediately
[00:21:10] became avid pugilists. For three exuberant rounds to the delight of the company, the little bull
[00:21:18] bifolk and the little gorilla, Lupachini, engaged in mutual annihilation. When Sergeant Richard
[00:21:28] claimed his mask gear to end the brawl, the troops and much of the ships crew were an
[00:21:32] cheering frenzy and it had been a grand fight. Both men were covered in blood and bruises and at
[00:21:39] the final claim, they wrapped arms and leaned against each other exhausted. My mortar men swarmed
[00:21:45] into the square, pummeling bifolk with congratulations, perkins who had been holding bifolks
[00:21:51] glasses, placed them carefully over his swollen eyes. I saw Burris then gently guide bifolk out of
[00:21:58] the ring, Gino Brian, Lupachini's platoon sergeant followed with his man and Baker 17 was still
[00:22:05] whistling and cheering when the two fighters and their handlers went through the hatch and down the
[00:22:09] ladder to sick bay. Joe Kersaba stood next to me, so Joe Kersaba is one of the platoon commanders
[00:22:20] stood next to me. This outfit is coming together. He said Joe rarely smiled but there was a big grin on
[00:22:26] his face after that fight. So there's, you notice that in these stories about combat wrestling,
[00:22:35] fighting boxing, there is something to it. There is something to it that bonds men together.
[00:22:44] Fact. Back to the book. When we weren't on deck with the troops, the officers spent the waking
[00:22:52] hours around the wardrobe table. So the wardrobe on a ship is where the officers eat. Captain
[00:22:57] Wilcox, now the introduction to Captain Wilcox, he's the company commander and he's a vet from
[00:23:04] Ewo Jima. Captain Wilcox, let us in review of the principles and lessons of the rifle company combat.
[00:23:11] He and Joe Kersaba use their own battle experience as experiences as illustration. They focused on the
[00:23:18] chaos of combat and how the best laid plans always disintegrated under enemy fire.
[00:23:27] That's why we got to keep our plans simple. War is hell, Captain Wilcox, who had
[00:23:34] much experience at it would tell us, but you never know what particular kind of hell it is going to be.
[00:23:44] We studied the after-actions report that had come from the fifth Marines, the North Koreans,
[00:23:48] they had faced were tough, skilled fighters, every bit as tenacious in battle as the Japanese had
[00:23:53] been in the bitter Pacific Island fighting of the last war. The red soldiers, fifth Marines called
[00:24:00] them Gooks were well trained in the Russian style of combat with effective use of supporting armor,
[00:24:06] mortars and artillery. They were men who also were adept at night fighting. Fighting at night was
[00:24:14] a combat skill we had yet to learn. We would do so under fire and at a terrible cost.
[00:24:21] Joe Owen is actually not a platoon commander. He's the mortar section commander. In a company
[00:24:31] of call it 200, 200 Marines, there's multiple rifle platoons, maybe 40 guys, 50 guys,
[00:24:39] and each one of those rifle platoons. Then there's a little section of mortar guys and mortars
[00:24:44] aren't in direct fire weapons. For those of you that don't know anything about mortars, mortars,
[00:24:48] shoot rounds, you see them in movies, they're a tube. They're basically a tube and they're at a
[00:24:53] really high angle and you drop rounds into it and they fire at a very high altitude and high angle
[00:24:59] and then they drop down from straight above and hit targets. Joe Owen in this company is in
[00:25:05] charge of the mortar section. Back to the book, when Baker 17 was still on the way to war,
[00:25:14] the first and fifth Marines forced a landing across the title flats at Inchon Harbor.
[00:25:21] The radio in the ship's wardrobe was tuned to the tactical net and we listened to commanders
[00:25:27] on the beach as they reported the action to their senior echelons and made call for air and artillery
[00:25:34] support and ammunition resupply. Over the static and crackling transmission we could hear
[00:25:41] shells exploding, small arms fire, battlefield curses and the screams of wounded men.
[00:25:49] The transmissions were piped out onto the deck where the troops also listened to the grim sounds.
[00:25:56] I left the wardrobe and went out to be with my mortar men. They sat in a tight cluster staring
[00:26:03] intently at a loudspeaker as they heard the war that was about to swallow us. That's a real introduction
[00:26:16] right there. You know you're going to war and you get to listen to guys on the ground and
[00:26:20] the fierce fire fighting here, the shouts and screams of the wounded. That's a reality. That's a reality
[00:26:27] check right there for those guys. At this point, oh when he kind of wants to pick up a platoon instead
[00:26:37] of being the mortar section he kind of feels like mortar section. There's a little bit in the rear
[00:26:41] and he wants to be a rifle tuned commander. If you remember what Mack Allen said,
[00:26:46] the last book we did about the Korean War and rifle tuned commander rifle tuned commander,
[00:26:51] rifle tuned commander. That's what if you're gung-ho, that's what you want to do.
[00:26:55] And so Joe Owen he feels kind of like, you know, I wish I was a platoon commander. That's what I want
[00:27:00] to do. But he's a mortar section commander. Okay. That's fine. Well he tries to get that job.
[00:27:07] And he says, he's kind of pressing to get that job up the chain of command. I should have
[00:27:12] backed off. I plowed on. Sir, the word is that the first and fifth Marines are running short
[00:27:16] on Nutenits. I'd like to request transfer as a replacement. The captain turned to Cainy first sergeant.
[00:27:23] If you'll excuse us, I'd like a war to loan with Nutenit Owen. Yes, sir, responded Cainy. So kind of
[00:27:30] gets rid of the senior listed guy. He knew I was about to get reamed and he smirked it me as he
[00:27:35] disappeared behind the pile of crates. Captain Wilcox gave me that glare once again. You want to
[00:27:42] transfer out a baker one seven? Sir, it's the, it's only that I want to put my training
[00:27:47] as some use before the fighting ends. And to hell with your men. To hell with the company. Is that right,
[00:27:53] Nutenit? No, sir, Captain. It's just that it's just that you want to jump ship on us. The skippers face
[00:27:59] glistened with press perspiration and he turned into a steaming red. He'd been angry with me before,
[00:28:06] but never like this. Sir, I, okay, Nutenit. Here's what you do. You put your request for transfer
[00:28:11] and writing and I'll forward it. Approved. No sense holding back a gung-ho hot shot. The second
[00:28:16] lieutenant. Sir, it's not that I want to leave the outfit. It's just that I, I thought that put
[00:28:20] your request in writing. That's all lieutenant dismissed. Sir, I dismissed. So this is your typical,
[00:28:29] typical meatball that thinks he's going to, you know, he's just being gung-ho, trying to make
[00:28:33] something happen. Yeah, it's not a, not a good way to be. And you can see that. So that's another
[00:28:39] thing. You got to think about other people's perspective, right? You got to think about your
[00:28:42] boss's perspective. Your boss is sitting here trying to get this company together and then
[00:28:46] one of his section leaders go, hello, what goes in the world? Right, right. Kind of for him,
[00:28:50] so what is meatball? Meatball. Oh, sorry, that's just an expression for, it's an expression for a
[00:28:55] new guy in the sea old teams. Oh, no. Meatball or meat stick or FNG. Anyone of those can be utilized
[00:29:01] to defend. So I guess I threw it on on the, the new guy here. It kind of slipped out. Yeah, okay.
[00:29:07] Okay. Now they get on shore and back to the book, we passed a company of third
[00:29:17] battalion that had been pulled off the line. It's men were sprawled along the road, unshaven
[00:29:23] and ragged, we read by days of fighting. So there's another, another little wake-up call
[00:29:30] seeing the guys that are coming off the line. Now they get into a position, this is Baker 6,
[00:29:38] move forward out, Captain Will Cox ordered when we all reported ready. As we started across
[00:29:43] the bean field, we were greeted by a few salot of flacking sounds, North Korean bullets
[00:29:48] tearing through the bean plants. Flock, fack, fack, all around us. I kept an eye on my men.
[00:29:54] They crouch low, but they stayed together and moved ahead. Then the cry,
[00:29:58] I call him and God, I'm hit. A few feet from me. A marine from Kaiser's platoon
[00:30:03] arrived on the ground. His hands clutching his belly. Grayish red and testins pushed through
[00:30:09] his fingers and blood, staying the ground as he thrashed about screaming in his pain and terror.
[00:30:15] For the first time, I felt the shivers of dread, the awful fear that comes with combat.
[00:30:20] I froze a second. How many seconds? Until I once again became aware of the flacking sounds
[00:30:30] in the bean plants and I yelled at the men, move it, you people keep moving. They bent lower
[00:30:36] to the ground as we went forward. The North Korean mortars came. Spouts of earth and black smoke
[00:30:43] leaped about us, laced with flame and screaming shrapnel. Believes from being plants spawned
[00:30:50] in fluries and the ground shook. I was suddenly in the midst of a frenzy storm of noise.
[00:30:56] Mortars whistled and crashed, bullets wind and leaves, thwacked, men shouted prayers and blasts
[00:31:01] from me. The far end of the bean field was the deck of a rice patty. We headed for its cover.
[00:31:08] A string of mortar shells exploded around us and a man threw himself to the ground, kicking and
[00:31:13] screaming, can't take this, I can't take this! Screech the fear-stricken marine,
[00:31:18] then he curled up himself into a fetal ball. I ran to him and prodded him with a button my
[00:31:24] car bean. On your feet, his head was buried in his arms. Can't take this, he wailed.
[00:31:30] Get up or I'll shoot you. The sound of the words coming from my mouth was unreal to me.
[00:31:37] Jesus, don't shoot me the man wind. Tears cut pale streaks through the dust on his cheeks as he
[00:31:43] stared and horror at my car bean, which was inches from his face. I grabbed a man by his collar
[00:31:49] and pulled him up to his feet. Move, I yelled. Sergeant Dale from the first patoon ran toward us.
[00:31:55] I got him, lieutenant. He's from my patoon. Dale said. So there's fear.
[00:32:02] Then you can see Joho in his feeling fear and he's dealing with it. And this other young
[00:32:08] marine is feeling fear and he's not dealing with it. Then they they finally get to that
[00:32:14] dieker cross the field. Back to the book, I crawled up the diek to peer over the top.
[00:32:18] Smoke obscured my view, but far ahead and across the road I detected some movement.
[00:32:23] The enemy positions were difficult to locate. No flash came from their weapons when they
[00:32:27] fired. I raised my binoculars. Before I could focus on the target, however, a flurry of bullets
[00:32:33] melted the diek and spurts of pebbles and dirt stung my face. I jerked my head back down and
[00:32:39] to cover. Besides me, a rifleman tumbled away from the diek. He made a choking sound and his helmet
[00:32:46] bounced to the ground. Blood gushed from his head, which suddenly became a wet crimson pulp.
[00:32:53] Another wave of fear shuddered through me, a massive paralyzing force. Again, I froze,
[00:33:00] aware only of that blood drenched face and head. Captain Wilcox voiced cracking,
[00:33:07] crackled out of my walkie-talkie. Baker five, this is six, come in.
[00:33:11] The voice snapped me from my paralysis. Baker six, this is five, come in six.
[00:33:17] I was scrambling back up the diek. I knew the skipper wanted the 60s, the 60s are his mortar,
[00:33:22] 60mm mortars, to bear on the North Koreans who had us under fire. Get those guns cranked up,
[00:33:28] five over. Roger that six, I said to the radio on the double. Surged at wingets, gun was a
[00:33:34] few yards away behind the diek and I crawled over to get in front of it. Stand by for H.E. Fire
[00:33:38] Mission, I called the winget. Number one gun standing by H.E. Fire Mission, the staunch winget
[00:33:43] called back. With all the will I could muster, I forced my head above the diek by noculers at the
[00:33:49] ready. The terror of having my head blown off to a pulp was diminished by fear of losing the
[00:33:55] respect of my men. So there's a couple things there. You've heard me say, you train how you fight.
[00:34:05] What they go back to is the fundamentals that they practice and trained and we didn't
[00:34:11] dive too much in the training. But if you ever, if you've ever seen Marines in the field with
[00:34:16] a 60mm mortar, I haven't seen Army guys, I'm sure they're outstanding too, but when you see the
[00:34:20] Marines setting up a mortar for a fire mission, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. And this is
[00:34:25] exactly what it's like even in the 90s, you know, 40 years after after the Korean War, when I
[00:34:32] would watch the the mortarman set up a mortar to shoot, it was just like that. They'd be stand by
[00:34:37] for fire mission and then, you know, one of the sergeant would call out. Number one gun standing by
[00:34:41] H.E. Fire Mission, you go back to your training and those fundamental basics that you learn,
[00:34:48] the simple commands, that's what you go back to. That's why you train. That's why you use repetition.
[00:34:55] So when that fear comes up, you go back to what you know. Your instinct becomes instead of
[00:35:01] cowering, your instinct becomes to do what you've trained out of do. Back to the book,
[00:35:09] all along the Dykes, our Marines were sprawled heads below the edge. The corpsmen had moved
[00:35:14] their wounded alongside the road waiting for the ambulance jeeps, the meat wagons to come up.
[00:35:20] There were two bodies face covered by ponchos. They were Baker one sevens first killed an action,
[00:35:26] the KIA's, Baker's the company at the right. That's why they keep referring to Baker one seven,
[00:35:35] first battalion, Baker company. Back to the book, someone said,
[00:35:40] it won't be nothing left up there by the time the artillery gets it. So what's going on here is
[00:35:47] they call in some some big guns, some big so a 60 millimeter more small and when you start calling in,
[00:35:52] how it serves big giant bombs are coming from the sky. That's what they call some of those in.
[00:36:00] And you know, you're sitting there watching the mountain where these, where these North Koreans are,
[00:36:04] they're seeing massive explosions. And so now back to the book, someone said, won't be nothing left
[00:36:10] of them up there by the time that artillery lets up. Staff Sergeant Richard the company armor
[00:36:16] was crouched near us. Don't fool yourself. He said artillery never wipes out the gooks,
[00:36:21] softens them up and keeps their head down. But they'll be there waiting when the guns let up.
[00:36:28] There's another lesson we learned a lot about. You know, you think you think that's no
[00:36:34] one could survive something and they do survive it. When we were running training, we had
[00:36:41] the humvies were shooting blanks. It's training. So the humvies would be big 50 caliber
[00:36:45] machine guns and they'd shoot blanks into a building and then the guys in the building would
[00:36:50] come and shoot back at them. And the guys going through the training, the seals,
[00:36:53] they'll, you know, we shot a bunch of 50 cowl in there. Those guys wouldn't be alive. And you know,
[00:36:58] I would say no, actually they will be alive. They will be alive because I've seen it. And those 50
[00:37:05] cows, they're on awesome weapon. But there's a guy, two rooms deep inside that building. You can
[00:37:10] shoot all those rounds in there. He's going to be okay. And as soon as you let up, he's going to be
[00:37:13] there shooting back at units. The same thing with obviously with the big artillery and the North
[00:37:17] Koreans are dug in. I scrambled to my feet. Keep moving. The men were all up and they ran after me
[00:37:26] bent under the weight of their guns and ammo. Get us the hell out of here. Someone cried.
[00:37:31] And so what do they do? They attack. So when you're pinned down, it's just another example.
[00:37:35] When you're pinned down attack. And here's what it looks like. Back to the book. Two of Kaiser
[00:37:40] Squads moved up and short bounds while a third laid a base of fire.
[00:37:47] Covered move. You're going to see cover move all throughout this book. And every time we bring it
[00:37:51] up, I'm going to mention it. Because I want to make sure everyone that's listening, those those
[00:37:55] folks that are in the military, you hear it every single time. This is the first one of many.
[00:38:00] Two of Kaiser Squads moved up and short bounds while a third laid a base of fire. The first 50 yards
[00:38:05] went easily. Then the North Koreans popped out of cover and took us under fire. Suddenly the ground
[00:38:11] before us was scared with torrents of bullets. Mortar shells whistled in and exploded along
[00:38:16] Koyzer's line. Carmen. Carmen. So if you don't know, Carmen is a medic in the army, it's a
[00:38:23] medic in the Navy. It's called a corpsman and navy corpsmen are the ones that go and deploy
[00:38:30] with the Marine Corps as medics. So that's when you hear those corpsmen calls, that's what it is.
[00:38:35] Carmen. Carmen came a despairing whale. Ad topple, lurched up from prone position and ran
[00:38:41] toward the wounded man as enemy bullets spurred it around him. Besides me, another man went down
[00:38:46] with a grunt and did not move. Fear slammed my gut once more and I was flat on the deck.
[00:38:54] Nichols was down there with me. What do you want to do, Lieutenant? Nichols plump young
[00:39:01] face, streaked with dirt and sweat, showed the same fear that had me in its terrible grip.
[00:39:07] Jesus, the boy depends on me. I forced my head up. That's a classic. What do you want to do,
[00:39:19] Lieutenant? I was, I think I might have talked about this, but I was in, when I was in Sri Lanka
[00:39:28] and I was a young kid and there was all those guys that were hardcore combat veterans.
[00:39:32] And one of the captains, Army captains, again Sri Lankan Army captain who had been in tons of combat.
[00:39:40] And I was talking to him, I was trying to like, gunner information about war because I hadn't been
[00:39:45] in any and he'd been in a ton. He was a wounded and trapped on his face and I'm talking to him,
[00:39:53] you know about it and he said, you know, when you're in a war, it was it's pretty easy
[00:40:00] to take care of yourself. Take care of yourself. Like, he said, if I was in a war,
[00:40:05] if I, when we were in a fire fight, if I just had to take care of myself, I'd be okay.
[00:40:09] But when you're in charge of everyone, it's totally different. Then now, the sudden,
[00:40:14] you got people saying, what do you want us to do, Lieutenant? And that's the pressure, which I will never
[00:40:21] forget him, tell me that story. And that's a great example of it right there. Sure, he's scared.
[00:40:26] He's scared, but he's got a mortar section waiting for him to wait for him to tell him what to do,
[00:40:32] to save them. Now we get introduced to a guy named Lieutenant Lee, who's a Chinese American guy,
[00:40:43] very by the book and very hardcore. You're gonna hear play about Lieutenant Lee here. Lieutenant Lee
[00:40:49] came upon Baldwin's gun. Sir, I think we should move this gun Baldwin said to his Lieutenant.
[00:40:53] It's kicking up dust. You have a good position here Baldwin, responded Lieutenant Lee.
[00:40:57] I'll show you how to handle the dust problem. Lee opened up his canteen and walked around the
[00:41:01] machine gun sprinkling precious water as he went. Now fire off a burst orderedly. The machine gun
[00:41:07] fired, but Ray's no dust. Lieutenant Lee walked on up the hill, ignoring enemy bullets that hit
[00:41:14] around him. Moving forward a little bit. Hey, Lee, called by folk. Get down. We're getting shot at.
[00:41:24] By folk had Lieutenant Lee's attention. Lieutenant dashed to where by folk was hugging the ground.
[00:41:29] You addressed me as Lee. He asked, standing over the astonished young marine.
[00:41:35] Jesus, yeah, get down. You're drawing fire. You on your feet,
[00:41:38] demanded Lee. Bullets sit through the air, punctuating the bizarre scene of a lieutenant bracing a
[00:41:44] PFC to attention in the midst of a fire fight. You call me Lieutenant Lee or Sir. You understand
[00:41:51] that marine? Yes, yes, sir. Stamored by folk, wishing that he were in a very deep foxhole.
[00:42:00] And you never forget that. Understand? Now carry on. Said the Lieutenant and he proceeded to walk
[00:42:05] further up the hill, seemingly oblivious to the enemy fire. What the hell? I thought by folk.
[00:42:13] And he got up to walk behind Lee. The rest of the mortar squad arose and followed. So like I said,
[00:42:20] Lee is by the book. And that's an extreme example. I don't think I necessarily agree with that
[00:42:27] example either. But Lee's gonna hold the line. And maybe there was much danger as he thought. But
[00:42:35] instilling that discipline, he's given no slack. Back to the book, while the mortar is
[00:42:43] obscured the enemy's view, Van Winkle moved his people up. So you got the mortar's dropping fire
[00:42:50] and that allows Van Winkle to move his people. That's called cover and moved by the way.
[00:42:54] Nearing the top of the ravine, Hank Kaiser positioned his assault squad to follow a barrage of
[00:42:59] grenades into the enemy positions as soon as the mortar's lifted. So you got three situations. You
[00:43:04] got the mortar's are going in. That's the first cover. Then once the mortar's lifted, they're going to
[00:43:08] throw grenades. That's your second cover. Bam, carriers for the marine machine guns,
[00:43:14] filled in with riflemen on the line of assault, ready to charge up the last few yards of ground.
[00:43:19] Lee was with them, Van at fix to the top of his car bean. The mortar's fired a final barrage.
[00:43:26] Their explosions were followed by the sharper impact of grenades thrown at enemy holes.
[00:43:31] Shouts and war cries swelled from charging Marines who leaped Van at's pointed into the enemy
[00:43:36] positions that were dug in along the face of the ridge. Some of the North Koreans stood to fight.
[00:43:41] Their Van at's also fixed, but they were cut down. Others scurried over the hill,
[00:43:46] many were shot from behind as they tried to escape. We all knew had been a far from perfect
[00:43:53] exercise. Some of the men had been slow to respond to direction. Not all of our orders were clear enough
[00:44:01] for quick and effective fire and movement. We were fortunate that the enemy had not chosen
[00:44:08] a fight to the death defense of this hill as they would have advanced as they would when we
[00:44:13] advanced further north. Think about this point, not all of our orders were clear enough
[00:44:21] for quick and effective fire and movement. He's not even blaming the guys. He knows that the mistake
[00:44:26] was that they weren't being simple clear concise with their orders and that makes everything lag.
[00:44:34] Back to the book and we had nearly reached the top captain Wilcox pushed wevers,
[00:44:38] platoon through Kaiser's for the final assault. Platoon Sergeant King led the charge and we could
[00:44:44] hear his piercing rebel yells all over the hill. Once again, it was a ragged performance. Ors
[00:44:52] confused in the hellish noise, men who bunched close together and some who hesitated to risk
[00:44:58] the move against enemy fire. However, clumsy we were, though, we had the fundamentals right.
[00:45:05] The NCOs directed their sectors of fire. The fire teams went forward in bounds, covering each
[00:45:12] other as they progressed and our machine gun and mortar fire stayed ahead of the advance
[00:45:18] and kept the enemy heads down. That's what that's what small unit tactics are.
[00:45:24] It's cover move, cover move, cover move.
[00:45:27] Now, they're digging in some some night defenses and because they're these peaks, I mean,
[00:45:38] this huge mountainous terrain steep cliffs, they end up disaggregated across the battlefield.
[00:45:44] So they're not, they're not right next to each other because there's valleys between them.
[00:45:49] Back to the book, we had to set our own isolated perimeter and we couldn't tie our
[00:45:54] flanks to the other companies for mutual support. The same hell true for attack,
[00:45:59] almost always the battalion was channeled, channeled into attacking some with one company,
[00:46:04] one hill at a time. This sort of isolated fighting made it difficult to communicate with
[00:46:11] battalion and other companies. That problem was not solved. Much of the time, we company-level
[00:46:19] officers were on our own initiative decentralized command. Just decentralized command. So,
[00:46:26] imagine this, you can't talk to battalion. There's a hill that cuts your radio signal. You have
[00:46:30] to be, you have to know what the intent is of the operation and you have to be out there ready to
[00:46:34] execute on your own to the best of your ability underneath the commanders intent.
[00:46:41] Back to the book, I learned how to deflect the fear.
[00:46:44] After the first jolt of it, which came with the initial shock of coming under fire,
[00:46:52] I would force myself upright and attempt to read the situation before the skippers' boys came
[00:46:58] crackling out of the walkie-talkie. Once I had rammed myself into action,
[00:47:04] the fear subsided. It never completely went away though. So, people asked this all the time how
[00:47:10] we get overcome fear. And what did he do to overcome fear? He forced himself into action.
[00:47:17] Didn't wait! You start feeling that fear? Go! Go get up, take a look at that situation,
[00:47:23] try and analyze it, and his own clock, what he made for himself, the timer that he made for himself,
[00:47:28] was I'm going to, I'm going to assess the situation before the boss calls me. So, that's the time
[00:47:33] we put on himself. That forced him into action. So, we say this over and over again. Your afraid
[00:47:39] is something, step into it. Take action. Don't wait! Back to the book, there was no deflecting the
[00:47:48] confusion that became with every firefight. The will during patterns of noise and grotesque scenes
[00:47:55] exploded all around. Men screamed in rage and pain and fear. Swarms of bullets, wind and splattered
[00:48:05] close by, the mortars blasted, hurled flames and slices of steel and raised clouds of greasy black smoke.
[00:48:15] The sparing voice is yelled, corpsmen and someone would surely call what do we do, lieutenant?
[00:48:23] In the turmoil, the officers and sergeants made themselves visible and we shouted orders.
[00:48:28] Watch your sector or move up or bear on me or go to machine gun 10 o'clock 300 yards.
[00:48:36] We subdued the fear and showed the men that we were in command. And I've talked about this one before
[00:48:44] too. I talked all the time about, oh you got to explain to everybody why, you got to explain to
[00:48:47] why, you want everyone to be happy, you want people to form the plan with you and you want
[00:48:51] to be there, plan you want them to take ownership and then I also say that when you have a critical
[00:48:55] situation you have to lead and that's what he's talking about right here, you have to lead and
[00:49:01] that's what they do. They would give these to orders, simple, clear, direct orders of what to do in
[00:49:07] this situation and show the men that they were in command. Back to the book, we could have
[00:49:17] alleviated some of the confusion if our walkie talkies had worked in that as advertised. The
[00:49:22] handheld two-way radios were supposed to transmit and receive up to a mile in distance.
[00:49:28] We found that they rarely functioned over a hundred yards, never over uneven terrain.
[00:49:34] We carried them because they were all we had, but we had little faith in them.
[00:49:38] Instead, just like frontline military leadership throughout history, we relied on
[00:49:44] line-of-site communications, arm-and-hand signals, and we sent runners back and forth. In those first
[00:49:53] five days of combat, I learned to stay visible and I learned the value of a good runner.
[00:49:59] The North Koreans used a whistles and bugles for battlefield command, more effective by far
[00:50:07] than our walkie talkies. I'm a huge proponent of verbal commands. I think life told this story
[00:50:16] a bunch of times where I was telling you, you're used, he's trying to tell us guys what to do over
[00:50:20] the radio and I said, hey, life, give them verbal commands. When you're working,
[00:50:26] there's this everyone's talking on the radio and it turns into white noise. They're not responding.
[00:50:32] When you give a verbal command in the Seal Teams and the Military, you get trained
[00:50:38] that if I tell Echo, Peel right, you're good at when you hear that, you're instinct and you're
[00:50:43] training tells you to repeat that command. So you're in repeat at the next person when they hear,
[00:50:46] they're going to repeat it. So everyone repeats the verbal command.
[00:50:50] So when you say verbal command, that's like, it's the radio. Yeah, it's yelling,
[00:50:54] you have to yell and you're talking, but in all actuality, it's yelling. Yeah, it's yelling.
[00:50:59] And so the radios just sometimes, you know, and our radios are infinitely better than these
[00:51:06] radios and even while I was in, the radio has made vast improvements and by the end, by the time I
[00:51:11] retired, the radios were pretty damn good. But there are times if the radio is not working,
[00:51:17] you've got to go with the verbal commands. And that's why you've got to train. You've got to train
[00:51:21] for the verbal train without radios a bunch. I always tell guys, yeah, take the radios off.
[00:51:24] Make sure you can do without radios. How's it going to go if their communication net goes down?
[00:51:28] You've got to have that backup communication plan all the time. Hmm.
[00:51:37] Now here we are in another, another firefight. This is basically a massive bulk of fire
[00:51:43] fights back to the book. The North Koreans disappeared into the deep ditch that ran along the
[00:51:48] other side of the road. They were moving in our direction and we dove for the our own ditch.
[00:51:53] Grenades flew toward us but landed wide. There was a machine gun up ahead. However, I couldn't
[00:51:58] locate it and it started and it started to fire down on us. I tossed two grenades in the ditch where
[00:52:05] the North Koreans were concealed and told Burst to have his men crawl up, crawl over a clump of
[00:52:10] boulders 20 paces away. When the squad and its mortar were in, I told Nicholas to go for it.
[00:52:18] We were crouched together, but Nicholas turned to crawl away a bullet spear
[00:52:23] just through him backward against him against me. His blood spattered my dung threes.
[00:52:30] The boy made a terrible rattling sound and then was still his teenage face.
[00:52:37] Expressionless. Burst watched horrified and I waved him back when he began to crawl towards us.
[00:52:46] Then I took a deep breath, pressed myself flat to the ground and crept rapidly away from the ditch.
[00:52:51] I left Nicholas behind me where he had died. Harsh firefights and they wrap up this. They keep
[00:53:09] taking their objectives. They're taking a lot of casualties and this section here is after the
[00:53:14] fight is over back to the book. We grew silent thinking of our families. I took the snap shots from
[00:53:21] the webbing inside my helmet and remembered their images one by one. Then I thought about the
[00:53:28] days next mission and reviewed the fighting we had done that day. I tried to blank out the blood
[00:53:34] screams, men killing each other and dying, the ground exploding, bursts of flame and stabbing
[00:53:40] tracers, a hot smell of weapons at full automatic, the stench of guts and feces oozing from a dead
[00:53:48] marine and the shuddering fear. They continue pushing, they're pushing north and they're on
[00:54:11] one of these patrols heading north and we'll go back to the book through my binoculars. I saw
[00:54:17] bearded old Korean emerge from one of the huts. Papa's on we called these grandpa's who wore
[00:54:22] traditional garb of high black top hat and flowing white robes. The old fellow stood before his
[00:54:29] doorway watching the wilderness as weapons laden marines passed through his village.
[00:54:35] Crack went brain-ex-carbine, only a few inches from me and the old man felled the ground.
[00:54:42] The tall black hat fell beside him. Got the bastard, exclaimed brainic. His carbine was still
[00:54:51] up searching for another target. God damn fool, I yelled astonished at the murderous act.
[00:54:59] Without fought I slammed the butt of my own carbine into brain-ex-rids. Brain-ex-creamed with pain
[00:55:04] and went down to the ground writhing. I stood over him, poised to deliver another butt stroke.
[00:55:09] Got damn fool, I screamed again as right came from behind me and held my arms, wing it,
[00:55:15] was with right and pulled my carbine away. Hold it, lieutenant. Right shouted in my ear, hold it.
[00:55:21] What the hell happened? You see what he did, I screamed. I'll kill the
[00:55:26] dictorsky. The corpsman was already kneeling beside Brainic. He snapped a thread of morphine
[00:55:32] and jabed Brainic's arm. I endeavored to control myself, deep breaths. Okay, sergeant, I said,
[00:55:40] and right released his hold, the men were circling looking for me to Brainic. They were silent.
[00:55:47] Got damn it. He shot that old man for nothing, I yelled. Through the pain, Brainic,
[00:55:52] grown. I thought he was a goddamn gook. I thought he had a weapon. Any of you seen what happened?
[00:55:58] Wing it asked the men, no one responded. No witnesses right said softly to me.
[00:56:04] Whatever happened, nobody saw anything. The realization hit me. No one except me had witnessed
[00:56:10] Brainic shooting that old man. But if someone had seen me hit Brainic, I could be subject to
[00:56:16] a court martial for striking and elisted man. No witnesses right said again, no one saw anything.
[00:56:22] This stays in the mortars. I heard someone say, meaning we're just going to keep this amongst
[00:56:29] ourselves. Yeah, someone else responded. This stays with us. There was a murmur of a scent.
[00:56:36] Shall I move them out? Lieutenant, right asked? Yes, sergeant. I answered,
[00:56:41] numbly. Move them out. The morphine had not yet taken his effect on Brainic. He ground his
[00:56:48] teeth together to hold back cries of pain and he was scared. I bent over him and said,
[00:56:53] you know, you and I know what happened, Brainic. And you're going to have to live with it.
[00:56:59] Brainic nodded his head. He said nothing but blinked his tear-filled eyes and nodded his head.
[00:57:05] Take care of him, doc. Then I went to catch up with the mortarman. When I walked past the old man's
[00:57:11] hut, a circle of women and children surrounded the body crying their sorrow. And old woman caught my eye.
[00:57:19] I'm sorry. I said, although she wouldn't understand my words, we're all very sorry.
[00:57:33] It's madness. And again, you young military leaders out there. You've got to watch your
[00:57:40] people and you've got to give them good commanders intent. They've got to understand. They've got to
[00:57:45] understand what's right and what's wrong and that's going to come from you.
[00:57:53] Now, at this point in the book, and again, obviously, I'm not reading the entire book,
[00:58:00] but you all should. So you can capture everything that's in between, but I'm jumping forward a
[00:58:05] little bit here. They get relieved by the army. They move to the rear and they start getting
[00:58:12] word on what they're going to be doing. Back to the book, under the glare of the lantern,
[00:58:18] Captain Wilcox spread a map on the hood and we jostled for a view. Maps to this part of the world
[00:58:24] were scarce. This is the first one we had seen of the country beyond Hamhung. It was a topographic
[00:58:31] chart made by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea. The characters language on the
[00:58:36] map were Japanese, place names and legends had no meaning for us, but we could read the physical
[00:58:42] features and the contour lines. The terrain they showed was a military nightmare, roadblock and
[00:58:49] ambush territory. It was a country of high steep hills, deep valleys, and sharp ridge lines.
[00:58:56] The lower elevations were largely forested. Settlements were sparse, and the few roads
[00:59:03] twisted snake-like through tight passes and along riverbeds. At the northern extremity, the map,
[00:59:11] at the end of 70 miles of a narrow, corkscrew roadway was a meandering blue dot.
[00:59:18] That was the chosen reservoir. The Chinese have committed themselves to this war,
[00:59:24] began Captain Wilcox. They are in force. They are slicing through the Republic of North Korea's
[00:59:31] Army up north like a hot knife through butter. Up here, he used his bandet as a pointer to indicate
[00:59:39] the Chinese advance. The people will, we will fight, are the 124th division of the regular
[00:59:45] Chinese Army. Definite and confirmed no matter what Tokyo wants to believe. So the military command
[00:59:52] was in Japan. They weren't in Korea. The military command, the generals were over in Tokyo.
[00:59:57] So he said no matter what Tokyo wants to believe. This is who we're fighting. Back to the
[01:00:02] book, their tough, well-trained soldiers, 10,000 of them. And all of their officers are combat
[01:00:08] experienced. They're very best. After the briefing, I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox
[01:00:15] to ask him if we could leave Sergeant Wright. So Sergeant Wright, you've heard his name
[01:00:20] mentioned a few times. He was the senior and listed guy work and directly for Captain O and
[01:00:27] and it's actually time for him to go home. I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox to ask him
[01:00:34] if we could leave Sergeant Wright behind with the company moved out. Sergeant White has done a
[01:00:39] good job for us, but he's a short time or just waiting for paperwork I offered. Further more sir,
[01:00:44] it's not good for the troops to see him with his morale down. I'd like to replace him with
[01:00:48] Sergeant Winget before we hit anything serious up ahead. Good idea the captain said,
[01:00:54] except it's too late. Battalion says we mount out as we are. I'm not about to snarl up with them
[01:01:01] on a transfer detail right now. You tell Sergeant Wright that I'm sorry we can't do anything for him.
[01:01:07] I, I, sir. So that was a little opportunity for Sergeant Wright to get out of there,
[01:01:14] but it didn't work out. And now, just talking about kind of the morale, the troops back to the
[01:01:26] book, there was a great energy in the ranks, strong, healthy young men on the way to adventure.
[01:01:32] We cleaned and reclaimed weapons and earnestly sharpened our bayonets and fighting knives.
[01:01:38] The old salt's retold stories of Japanese ferocity on the Pacific Islands. Others remembered
[01:01:44] pitch battle with the Chinese bandits along with the pleasures of the North China occupation.
[01:01:50] The newly blooded veterans of last month's fight boasted to the replacements about their
[01:01:56] triumphs over the stubborn North Koreans. All hands speculated about whether the quality of the
[01:02:01] Chinese army would be equal to that of the North Koreans we had beaten down south. The fear that
[01:02:07] settles in the gut before combat had not yet surfaced. On that crisp morning with our clean,
[01:02:14] even faces, clean dungries, square-to-way gear, full canteens, full bellies, and full issue of ammunition,
[01:02:23] the Marines of Baker 17 feared no one. They started heading up north and one of the
[01:02:30] kernels is out. Colonel Litsenberg was there. He stood beside the road as we passed nodding and smiling
[01:02:35] at his fighters. You're looking good, Marine. You're looking good, Marine. He kept saying,
[01:02:40] and all the men waved and smiled back at him. The veterans from down south were recognized,
[01:02:45] all recognized old Homer. They had seen him frequently up on the line. Good hunting, Owen. Good hunting,
[01:02:52] young man. He called them me as I passed by.
[01:02:54] Now he has that opportunity now to maybe figure out a way out for right, who had the opportunity
[01:03:10] go away. While the men were loading up on ammo, I talked to Sergeant Wright. No sense for you
[01:03:17] to go up, I told him. Your orders could come down from battalion any time now. Stay here with the
[01:03:21] gunning. I appreciate that lieutenant responded Sergeant Wright, but I do want to stay with the
[01:03:28] mortars. If it's okay with you, that's what I'll do. I nodded. It's okay with me, Sergeant.
[01:03:35] I just don't want you wasting time getting back to your kids. He said, Stifley, I'll stay with
[01:03:41] the sections, sir. He didn't like my favoring him. He went back to the mortarmen and told
[01:03:47] them to get ready to move out. I'm telling you, there's a certain bond. There's a certain bond.
[01:03:57] And obviously in this case, it's a bond that's even stronger than the bond he has with his kids.
[01:04:02] It is the bond that he knows his brothers and arms are going into harm's way, and he's going with
[01:04:07] him no matter what. So now we get Baker one seven. They're dug into some positions. They've moved,
[01:04:18] and now they're dug into some positions back to the book. In the brush below Kaiser's
[01:04:21] Patoon, Chinese assault squads were waited in disciplined silence for the rockets and bugles
[01:04:27] that would signal them to attack. They're quilted uniforms kept them from shivering in the chill
[01:04:33] night. They already knew in detail how Kaiser's defenses were set up and the location of each forward
[01:04:41] hole and our weapons. During the later afternoon, their officers had watched Baker one seven
[01:04:47] dig in and they knew our line as well as we did. Under cover of darkness, the assault teams had
[01:04:54] crept soundlessly into their jump-off positions within grenade range of the marine mine.
[01:04:59] These soldiers were honored that they would be the first Chinese to attack American Marines.
[01:05:09] So these guys are staged and ready, and here we go. The sound of a rocket ripping through the air
[01:05:15] close above us jolted me away can brought me upright in our hole. Kelly was with me, a streak of
[01:05:21] fluorescent green crossed our line, followed by a red rocket from the other direction. Bugles
[01:05:26] blared and whistle shrild down the Sudan valley. The luminous hands of my watch said zero, zero,
[01:05:33] three, zero, Baker one seven was under attack. A sudden clamor erupted from Hank Kaiser's side of the hill,
[01:05:41] the eerie chant, malin die, malin die issuing from a chorus of Chinese voices, then the crash of
[01:05:48] mortars, the boom, and concussion of grenades in the sharp sputter of burp guns.
[01:05:53] Seconds later, there was the deeper sound of answering marine rifles and bars joined by the
[01:06:00] pounding of arm-machine guns and the explosion of marine grenades. The screams of wounded men
[01:06:07] soon added to the malage of sounds, along with profanities of rage in both languages.
[01:06:15] Fast forward a little bit, Chinese grenades exploded into the line and their burp guns blazed.
[01:06:27] The first wave of enemy soldiers rushed in and forward holes were buried in mounds of
[01:06:32] quilted uniforms, clubbing and stabbing that Chinese surged up the third battoons hill.
[01:06:39] Behind them were left dead marines and wounded men who cried for the help of their corpsmen.
[01:06:46] One of the things that they talk about in here is one of the tactics that the Chinese used
[01:06:51] is not everyone who would even carry a weapon when they would attack. If you were a guy that wasn't
[01:06:57] carrying a weapon, you would go attack and soon as someone got shot, you would take the weapon and carry on.
[01:07:02] That's how many people they had, number one. They also didn't have a weapon for every guy.
[01:07:10] They would have given them. But they also said, here's the plan. But then think about how
[01:07:14] now light you are. You're not even carrying a weapon. You're not even carrying any ammunition or anything.
[01:07:18] You're just able to travel and it's hard for people that
[01:07:22] we're never put on gear. It burns you down so much it just makes you so and you get used to it.
[01:07:29] Sure. But when you can get as used to it as you want, when you take it off, you feel like Superman.
[01:07:34] These Koreans are the Chinese are feeling like Superman sneaking up into these positions.
[01:07:40] They also had real legit winter gear at least this group. We're going to run in some groups that
[01:07:44] didn't have it. But they got these nice quilted uniforms and jackets. That's they're just bringing it.
[01:07:52] They're bringing it back to the book. Van Winkle ready the Marines near him for the next
[01:07:59] Chinese attack putting his people into recaptured fighting holes. The men stacked Chinese bodies in
[01:08:06] front of their holes for greater protection. Somebody yelled, the Van Winkle, that his own shoulder
[01:08:11] was bleeding. The big sergeant felt his arm and found a Chinese bullet had indeed passed through his
[01:08:16] shoulder. He didn't care. Nobody, sorry, nearby a man on the ground sobbing and shaking.
[01:08:26] My buddy, my buddy, Gooks shot his head clean off. The orange glare of a Chinese grenade illuminated
[01:08:34] the sobbing Marine. Van Winkle crawled over to the man, grasspeas are him saying, come on kid, come
[01:08:40] with me. You'll be alright. He rose from the ground and pulled the kid up with him.
[01:08:48] Leadership. Going forward a little bit, Archie Van Winkle now found himself on the lower
[01:08:56] fringes of the Chinese attack. He ignored his wounded shoulder and fired his carbine one handed.
[01:09:01] He called for nearby remains Marines to follow and launched his own attack into the flank of the
[01:09:07] Chinese who were moving up towards Kaiser. So you got to guys wounded, just picking up young Marines
[01:09:12] to get them back in the game, firing his rifle with one hand and leading it, leading it,
[01:09:17] attack on the flank of the Chinese, that are attacking his buddy.
[01:09:23] Higher up the hill, Gunny Foster brought Sherman Richter's two machine guns from first
[01:09:28] platoon and they commenced pounding down Kaiser's slope, withering fire and exploding grenades.
[01:09:33] Now from both flanks and above stymied the Chinese attack, there was a series of whistle signals
[01:09:41] and the attackers fell back. They crawled over their dead but pulled their wounded with them
[01:09:46] as they backed down to the bottom of the hill and into the woods. They were supported by
[01:09:52] well-directed covering fire and they held good order as they withdrew. When the Chinese were
[01:09:57] finding off the hill, the Marines ceased their fire and both Marines went silent. So the Chinese
[01:10:04] are also doing cover move as they even as they leave as they withdraw.
[01:10:15] They, they're, they're in another little firefight and oh, when's trying to quickly get his
[01:10:24] mortar up and they drop a, they drop a mortar around the way a mortar works. You drop the mortar
[01:10:31] into the, the round into the tube and it fires. If there's a misfire to really, it's a scary situation
[01:10:37] because so if you drop the mortar into the tube and it doesn't come out, it doesn't shoot.
[01:10:42] Well now you've got a live round inside the mortar tube. So you have to literally pick up the tube
[01:10:47] and let gravity pull, like let the mortar round slide out and you put your hands there to catch it.
[01:10:54] Yeah. Well, why does it explode? It's not like a timer or nothing. No, it's like, yeah, it's got a little
[01:10:59] detonator that makes it shoot and you got a little propellant around the fin that makes no
[01:11:05] different ranges. But essentially you drop this thing in there and it's supposed to shoot out.
[01:11:10] And when it doesn't, it's a scary situation. It's now you've got a live round inside your mortar tube
[01:11:15] and in order to get it out, you, you, you just lift the mortar tube up and you kind of pull
[01:11:21] around into your hands. Yeah. So they get a dug round and there's a bunch of things that can
[01:11:26] call it, cause a dug round. Some of it can be, you know, a bad batch of ammunition.
[01:11:31] But that's what's going on here. They get a dug round, dug round, try another one. I told
[01:11:35] we again, they're trying to get some mortar's down range. So they're on a panic situation and
[01:11:38] they're getting shot at by the way, too. Dug round, try another one. I told we get Kelly yelled for us to
[01:11:43] hurry up. Wing it asked me to wait while he checked the tube for an obstruction. He grabbed a
[01:11:48] long stick, which he shoved into the tube. He pulled out a cleaning rag. The cause of our misfire.
[01:11:55] It was careless that we had not checked the tube for an obstruction before we fired.
[01:12:01] Wing it said, I won't tell anybody about this if you don't. And he said,
[01:12:06] shout out damn it. I yelled at him. And this is the reason I highlighted this because he said, my fear showed
[01:12:13] itself in anger. And I think that's an important thing to think about. We all know, we all know
[01:12:21] when someone's getting mad, that they're probably afraid, right? They're afraid of something.
[01:12:26] That's, so we all see that. So if you're in a leadership position and you start losing your
[01:12:31] temper, it's, it's very visible to everybody that you're just scared. Yeah, you might be also
[01:12:37] frustrated, but it's showing you what it's showing is that you're losing control of your emotions.
[01:12:41] And that's why we can't do that in leadership positions. You can't do that. That's why it's so
[01:12:46] much infinitely better to remain calm. Yeah, when, uh, frustration, like all this, so if you go into a
[01:12:56] situation where you're scared, you know, so a lot of times, especially if you're like an alpha type
[01:13:01] person or a powerful person, you go and you feel that fear, it's basically the fear kind of is this
[01:13:07] feeling of weakness. So a natural tendency goes for pretty much everybody. And that's right.
[01:13:13] Yeah, it's the bounce back. So, so you, your natural way to invoke power is a girl like this
[01:13:20] anger aggression type attitude. So when, you know, leaders or what I want, they feel that fear. It's like,
[01:13:26] oh my powerless, it's like a subconscious thing. I'm powerless right now. So I got it. I got a fight back.
[01:13:32] So comes anger in this point. And the thing is what you just said, we all humans know that
[01:13:40] instinctively. So when you see a leader start to act like that, it becomes very clear that there's
[01:13:46] some emotion there, some fears, some frustration, some anxiety. Yeah. And that's gonna spread by the way,
[01:13:52] if I start panicking and start getting crazy, echo, you gotta get this done. You know, I'm scared.
[01:13:56] So now you're saying, wait, if Jockel's scared, I'm almost scared too. And now we start having issues.
[01:14:04] So try and remain calm is the, is the basic principle. So, they get done with that particular
[01:14:15] firefight. And we got a little debrief here on it. Back to the book, Baker 17 lost more men that night
[01:14:22] than we had in the first five days of our campaign against the North Koreans.
[01:14:27] Captain Wilcox raised hell. When he heard Sergeant Dale and his men had been killed and they're
[01:14:32] sleeping bags. I didn't cover this section, but one of the, one of the small elements they were in
[01:14:36] their sleeping bags got overrun and killed. So Captain Wilcox raised hell. When he heard that Sergeant
[01:14:41] Dale and his men had been killed and they're sleeping bags, he made it standard operating procedure
[01:14:46] that the company stayed out of sleeping bags at night and when we were on the line.
[01:14:51] Tell your people that they can put their feet in the bags and loosen their boom dockers. That's
[01:14:57] as far as they go, he told us. From then on, no matter how cold it became, we slept outside of our
[01:15:03] bags and our boots only came off to change socks. Now, I didn't cover this part where this happens,
[01:15:16] but one of these guys, Sergeant Loney, he had taken a patrol to another area in one of the mortars
[01:15:24] and when he went, they got lost. And then when they got lost, they got overrun and instead of fighting
[01:15:30] or doing anything, they just all ran. They just all ran in different directions. Now actually all
[01:15:34] of them lived, miracle, all of them lived. I shouldn't say they got no overrun, but fighting broke
[01:15:40] out and instead of doing something organized, they just all took off. And so, so Sergeant Loney,
[01:15:48] he's, they come back and they say, what, you know, Owen says, hey, what happened out there and
[01:15:53] they said, Sergeant Loney, just, you know, basically said every man for himself.
[01:15:56] And so he's about to get relieved of his command, which means you got fired in the military.
[01:16:04] Back to the book, Sergeant Loney, I'm relieving you your squad. He looks straight ahead,
[01:16:10] but his eyes moistened. You let your men down last night, you abandoned your responsibilities.
[01:16:15] It's only good luck that the squad wasn't wiped out. They could all be dead or taken prisoner.
[01:16:21] Loney's voice trembled. Lieutenant, it was pitch black down there. We were lost. I used my best
[01:16:27] judgment. I can understand getting lost, I said, but you said no security when the Chinese came through,
[01:16:34] you forgot to take, you forgot your men to take care of yourself. Lieutenant, I panicked.
[01:16:43] I admit that, but if you give me another chance, tears streamed down his cheeks and he looked to the ground.
[01:16:48] I can't give you another chance, your men don't respect you. You report to the CP. They'll give
[01:16:57] you orders from there. His head bowed. Sergeant Loney said, I'm sorry sir. I'm very sorry.
[01:17:04] I'm sorry to Sergeant dismissed. Sergeant Loney walked back to the section perimeter.
[01:17:11] Gathered his gear, then charged up hill to the CP. No one said goodbye to him. I felt sorry for the
[01:17:20] man, and I couldn't forget the times that fear had taken me close to the edge of panic too.
[01:17:30] That's why I included that, because Owen was going through all kinds of
[01:17:34] fearful situations. He knows that he's been close to that edge, but he doesn't cross the line.
[01:17:43] He holds the line, and that's the difference.
[01:17:52] Now, they're pressing forward again. This entire book is them either pressing forward or you're
[01:17:59] going to see quickly that it becomes them trying to leave. Once they're surrounded, back to the
[01:18:06] book, Baker 17 took point and marched for more than an hour without any sign of the Chinese.
[01:18:12] A single file of each of us on the side of the road, the men moving easily, so they're pushing
[01:18:18] forward enough, and it's happening all the sudden. Don't like this one damn bit, Lieutenant Owen.
[01:18:24] Oh Brian said to me, he was a reserved combat experienced from the Pacific War.
[01:18:31] It is a natural for the gooks to let us move up this easy. We're walking into their trap.
[01:18:38] All I know is that MacArthur says the first Marine division is going to go for the Yaloo River.
[01:18:46] I said the Yaloo River was North Korea's border with China. So, they've been ordered. Hey,
[01:18:52] you're going to the Yaloo River and pretty much they're all saying at this point they all kind of
[01:18:57] feel like it's a trap. But they're walking, they're not getting any resistance. Back to the book,
[01:19:03] the troops were in good humor. They joked and laughed as we marched and made them seen comments about
[01:19:08] the things that were central to their lives, the chow, the terrain, the enemy, the lack of women.
[01:19:15] Second thing I'm going to do when I see my wife again is take off my pack.
[01:19:19] I said one of the married reserves in the column.
[01:19:23] Oh yeah, came the answer by the time you see her again, you'll forget what the first thing was.
[01:19:30] Hell, it'll be so long before we get backstakes side. You'll be too old for that stuff.
[01:19:35] Someone else joked to the married man who is nearly 30 years old.
[01:19:43] I'm telling you guys keep up the good spirits and that is that is it's impossible. You know, I got
[01:19:48] to include this because I always had fun on the points. I was saying this the other day,
[01:19:54] we laughed out loud like once a day in Iraq, laughed out loud, hysterically at something.
[01:20:03] So for those of you that are civilians or don't have any comprehension of this kind of thing,
[01:20:10] guys that are in the military, they have a good time. Even in the worst situations,
[01:20:14] they're having we have fun. You have to. And you know, you can apply that to your job,
[01:20:21] to your job, when things get stressful, when things start getting hard. As a leader, if you're just
[01:20:27] bearing more stress on everybody, it's not going to help. One of the best ways to alleviate stress
[01:20:31] is to have some fun. And that's exactly what's going on here. The guys are on patrol. Okay,
[01:20:34] we're not getting shot at. So guess what? Let's bust this guy's ass about messing his wife.
[01:20:39] No problem. At alleviate some of that stress, you don't need to just bear down and create more
[01:20:46] stress on your people. Not been asked that a couple of people have asked me that on social media.
[01:20:50] Can you tell us about, you know, humor in, as a leader, when do you use humor?
[01:20:58] Absolutely. We always have fun. And you know, there's obviously a time to be serious, but there's
[01:21:04] plenty of time when you're going to joke around and have fun and poke funny each other all the time.
[01:21:10] Yeah, do you ever run into situations where, you know, some people they just joke more than
[01:21:17] other people. And then there's a, you know, the opposite guys, joke less. You ever run into a
[01:21:21] situation where you are serious and then someone's like trying to make jokes, you know, and it does
[01:21:26] get annoying or in the way of, I don't know that people, when when I'm serious, I don't get a lot of
[01:21:32] jokes, you're in the game. I'm just, I'm saying mostly. I mean, and I think I think there's a pretty
[01:21:42] I mean, maybe that happens in, you know, in a school setting, you know, or I guess in a business
[01:21:48] setting it could happen, but if you've got a, if you've got a good team that works a lot together,
[01:21:52] people know what you're serious. Yeah. And once you tell a joke or you crack a wise crack and nobody
[01:22:00] laughs and you just get a look from people going, hey man, shut up, that's it. You know, so maybe
[01:22:03] I've, maybe that's happening to me a dozen times in my career where somebody said something to, you know,
[01:22:07] everyone just said, okay, we're, you know, enough at everybody feels it. Yeah. Yeah, I would imagine
[01:22:14] to working that close with important tasks. Like that important, people are pretty going to be pretty
[01:22:18] much in tune with the comedy dynamic. Exactly. Now, I had a guy that I worked with when I was the
[01:22:25] admiral's aide and he, he and I, he was older than me, he was actually retired captain. He's one of
[01:22:32] my favorite guys, but I was the admiral's aide so as a young, you know, young lieutenant and he was a
[01:22:37] retired captain and we would go back and forth all day long regardless of what the situation was.
[01:22:44] We would never say a serious thing to each other. The entire day for months on end. Nothing,
[01:22:50] everything was a sarcastic kind of comment through each other and it made a pretty, a pretty
[01:22:56] miserable job of being the admiral's aide. It's not a fun job. It made it like we just had a good time.
[01:23:00] So once again, we're even in a situation where hey, I'm in a uniform and an office all day from
[01:23:05] six o'clock in the morning till 7 o'clock at night every day, day on day, you know, in the military
[01:23:11] and in the civilian world, when you come back from a trip from somewhere, they're like, oh,
[01:23:15] you, oh, you, we're on trip. Hey, you know, don't come into my morning, you know, you're coming
[01:23:18] in a little late because you got back at midnight. You're coming in at six. That's the way it is.
[01:23:23] There's no, there's no, oh, you haven't seen your family in two weeks. That's cool. We'll see
[01:23:27] it six o'clock in the morning tomorrow. Oh, you want to take your daughter to school? No, not
[01:23:30] happy. So it's like that. And yet, what I had this one guy that I worked with who we just, we
[01:23:36] just never said anything serious to each other and it always kept it light and fun. And that's,
[01:23:41] that was pretty awesome. Was that, do you, I mean, thinking back, do you think that that was on purpose
[01:23:47] or did it just kind of shake itself out like that? It just should itself out. You know, we just said
[01:23:51] funny, uh, the way our relationship was was we were just two guys that like to give each other a
[01:23:58] hard time about stuff and set each other up for stuff and just just, yeah, we both knew. I mean,
[01:24:03] he was under a stressful job as well. You know, he's got, he's got a lot of pressure on him. And so
[01:24:07] what are we going to do? Set there and be miserable all day? No, you know, what we're going to have a
[01:24:10] good time even in this, you know, fairly miserable administrative scenario that we're living in.
[01:24:16] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good time with it. Because some people do it on purpose where it's like,
[01:24:21] all dang things are getting real tense here. Yeah. I work with it. And so they'll throw in jokes.
[01:24:26] They're going to be on that fine line between, okay, you're right now things are tense. Why
[01:24:30] do you say that joke? That's inappropriate. And the other thing is just like it helps. You know,
[01:24:34] same like in like this guy and I, we would be even in the really stressful situation when no one
[01:24:40] else was joking. I might like, you know, shoot him a look across the room and roll my eyes at him like
[01:24:45] you didn't see this come and did you tough guy and we would just be laughing. So yeah, even then
[01:24:49] really stressful stuff, we would we would lighten it up. Yeah. That's because, you know, that's the first
[01:24:54] time that we had. Yeah. Yeah. All right, speaking of not no joke whatsoever back to the book,
[01:25:02] made your tie, the operations officer told us that there were increasing reports of heavy
[01:25:07] enemy concentrations on all sides of the battalion. However, General MacArthur himself was expressing
[01:25:15] impatience with a slow pace made by the first Marine Division and its progress toward the Chinese
[01:25:20] border. The army was trying to light a fire under General Smith, the Division commander. So
[01:25:26] you got the Marines are saying, hey, look, looks like we're starting to get surrounded here and
[01:25:32] talks a little bit about this in the book. The Marines were kind of slow rolling. They weren't,
[01:25:36] they weren't making any great effort to go as fast as they could because they felt like they were
[01:25:39] going to be trapped. So they weren't trying to move as fast as they could in MacArthur's general
[01:25:44] McCarthy in Tokyo, by the way, saying, hey, come on, Marines, you know, army's pushing up
[01:25:49] the real quick. What's wrong with you guys? But they're starting to get into our reports that they're
[01:25:53] being surrounded. And oh, by the way, Lieutenant Lee, who I talked about earlier, the real
[01:26:00] by the book guy, he actually got wounded and when he got wounded taken in hospital, he went on,
[01:26:06] he went on, he went absent without leave A wall. He went A wall from hospital to get back to the
[01:26:12] line. Oh, yeah, he's, oh, no, I'm fine. My arm can't move it. It's in a sling, doesn't matter. I'm going to fight.
[01:26:21] And speaking of Lee, talking about Lee's, Lee's platoon here, when they weren't on patrol,
[01:26:27] Lee put his men through a rigorous training program of small unit tactics. They maneuvered all
[01:26:33] over the nearby hills and they bitched at some extra work. Lee paid little heed to the grumbling.
[01:26:41] Soon we will meet the enemy. He predicted to his men. We will be ready. So Lee is a hard ass and his
[01:26:46] guys. Everyone else is doing, you know, they're, they're moving up north and it was an easy day of patrol
[01:26:51] because remember the Chinese, they're pushing hard against them right now. So what does he do at night?
[01:26:54] Oh, you guys, we're going to go do some work. We're going to go get some tactical drills.
[01:27:00] Back to the book. It was an article of faith with Lee that combat leadership came from the front
[01:27:06] in the attack. He positioned himself with the most advanced squad just behind the point.
[01:27:13] He wore a bright fluorescent pink vest, fashion of cloth panels that he obtained from the tactical
[01:27:19] air team. The intended purpose of the brilliantly colored panels was to mark the four extent of
[01:27:24] our lines for supporting aircraft. Lee wore his vessel and his men could locate him quickly during
[01:27:29] a firefight. He still had a sling on his wounded right arm and he carried his carbine in his left hand.
[01:27:37] He fired from the hip using it to shoot tracers that marked sectors. So Lee is just, I mean, a whole
[01:27:46] northern level, whole northern level, two in Lee. That's his full name, two in Lee. Now we get into a situation.
[01:27:59] The Chinese were dug in above Lee. They had a machine gun and a line of rifles more
[01:28:04] vulnerable than their usual defensive formations. They were expertly deployed below the crest
[01:28:10] and their automatic weapons fired short discipline bursts. Tracers street and bullets and
[01:28:15] shrapnel swept down the stroke. Slope. It took Lee some time to locate the machine gun that was
[01:28:22] giving the most trouble. When he found it, he fired one hand to put a tracer on it. His squad
[01:28:27] moved into skirmish lines and the NCO sent their own tracers to mark for their sectors. The bar
[01:28:33] and rifles followed, sending a great volume of fire up the slope at the Chinese.
[01:28:38] Wing it wave to me to let me know the mortar was ready. I aimed a tracer toward the machine gun
[01:28:43] and pumped my arm four times. The signal for 400 yards. I saw around leave the tube and follow
[01:28:50] its path that disappeared over the ridge line. Wing it realized that he was too long and without
[01:28:55] need for my correction, he came up a turn. So he's adjusting the where the mortar rounds hitting
[01:29:00] on his own. His second round was close and I waved him to fire for effect. We seldom wasted ammo
[01:29:07] bracketing a target. ammo carried up the hills was too valuable to be wasted on the niceties.
[01:29:13] The enemy gun slackened as winged as winged pounded them. Lee squad moved upward, responding to the
[01:29:20] NCO signals with short bounds. Fire team by fire team. 5 10 yards at a dash. Then the ground,
[01:29:27] bearing their enemy on the bearing fire on the enemy as the next fire team went in closer.
[01:29:32] Cover move. It's happening again. The mortar is covering form and then each individual
[01:29:36] fire team is covering for each other. It was the classic Marine rifle tactic that Lee had drilled
[01:29:43] into his platoon during his extra training sessions. A Marine went down and rioted on the ground.
[01:29:49] The platoon's corpsman built Davis dashed low across the slope and crashed at the wounded man's
[01:29:53] side. Another Marine fell and didn't move again. His buddy stabbed the dead man's rifle into the
[01:29:59] earth by its bayonet then continued forward. The Chinese found it difficult to defend against
[01:30:05] Lee's energetic tactics. Our coordinated mortar and machine gun fire kept them pinned to the ground.
[01:30:12] They were no longer able to apply aimed fire and their effectiveness to then diminished as our
[01:30:17] rifleman pushed closer in on them. Cover move. By the way, there's a reason why when I wrote down
[01:30:24] the four laws of combat, the number one rule is cover move. This is why.
[01:30:30] Lee sent a squad crawling forward into grenade range. I signal the winged to see
[01:30:35] his fire and the mortar stopped exploding along the forward crest of the hill. The Chinese soldiers
[01:30:41] heaved the broads of their potato masher concussion grenades down the slope. The Marines
[01:30:45] threw a responding volley, Argrinades were more powerful, filling the air with bits of hot flying
[01:30:50] steel. Both sides dove for holes, another volley was thrown. Lee ran forward, waving the
[01:30:57] carbine over his head and calling for his Marines to follow. They searched for the top,
[01:31:03] screaming their gun, hoe, and rebel yells. The Chinese withdrew. They pulled their wounded away,
[01:31:09] but left their dead on the slope. Lee pushed his men over the ridge line where they prepared
[01:31:14] to defend against a counter attack. Lupuccini stood beside Lee, his bar at the ready. Lupuccini
[01:31:20] had appointed himself Lee's bodyguard. Sergeant Bondaron, the Paltoon guide, rifle through the
[01:31:27] pockets of the dead Chinese gathering material for our intelligence people. I sent Kelly for a
[01:31:33] detail of the ammo carriers to bear the casualties. Bill Davis had two wounded men doped up with
[01:31:40] more feen and out of pain. And there was one Marine dead already covered by his poncho.
[01:31:47] When he was certain that the Chinese would not counter attack, Lee ordered us off the hill,
[01:31:53] end of patrol. On the return march to the company perimeter, no one complained about Lieutenant
[01:32:00] Lee's excessive training methods. He walked along the column and thanked the men for their good work.
[01:32:09] I wondered to myself how many fire flights Lee would survive standing at the front of his troops
[01:32:14] clad in that brilliant pink vest. So the excessive training, everyone's complaining when they're
[01:32:24] training and then you get to a firefight and everyone's thankful that they had good discipline
[01:32:28] leadership. A little bit more of Lee now, this point again, they're continuing to get pressed
[01:32:40] by the Chinese back to the book more Chinese fired broken out far to our right in front of Lee's
[01:32:46] in front of Lee's line. They fired from a sharp short hill that rose from the meadow. Lee
[01:32:52] wields one of his rifle squads to face the rise and maneuvered them forward. Burrace's gun was
[01:32:57] with Lee and he traversed the face of the hill with eight cheese before the squad moved up. So
[01:33:02] eight cheese is high explosive mortars and burrace is one of the mortarmen and he's covering
[01:33:07] for the movement of Lee as they're pushing up. The Chinese ceased firing with Drew quickly
[01:33:12] a familiar tactic. Lee stayed with the main body of his platoon and sent a fire team up to
[01:33:17] re-con order the top. When they reached the top of the rise, the four men walked along the
[01:33:22] ridge and search of the vanished enemy. Looking up Lee saw his men silhouette against the
[01:33:28] skyline and yelled for them to get down. They were perfectly outlined targets. The Chinese saw them
[01:33:34] too and already had the ridge line registered for their mortars. Their first rounds blew a marine
[01:33:41] to pieces. The next barrage claimed two more. The fourth man dove from the ridge and leaped
[01:33:47] rolled and stumbled down the hill. He came to a halt at the feet of Lieutenant Lee.
[01:33:53] Lee had seen three of his men needlessly killed and he stood in silent fury. His good hand
[01:33:59] gripped his car being so tight that his knuckles went white. Stupid. He hissed through his
[01:34:04] clenched teeth. Stupid. Stupid. Over and over again. Stupid. He turned to Jean O'Brien his platoon
[01:34:12] sergeant. See to it that this never happens again, sergeant. You tell the men if you, if I see
[01:34:18] another marine on the skyline, I will shoot him myself. Lieutenant Lee strode off to be by himself
[01:34:26] until his fury and frustration subsided. So you got guys making big mistakes and for those
[01:34:38] of you don't understand what happened when you stand up on the ridge line you're completely obvious.
[01:34:43] It's very clear and Lee's watching this happen and sees that his guys were a ripe target.
[01:34:48] He's yelling at him but it's too late and the mortar's hit. Now we get the company here,
[01:34:56] moving a little bit forward. Now the company is actually pinned down. The company's pinned down.
[01:35:04] Back to the book when the skipper had artillery's fire control on the radio. He called in the
[01:35:09] coordinates coordinates for a registration round. The battery of 105 mm howitzer that supported was
[01:35:18] dug in a mile and a half away. So in a mile and a half away you got these 105 mm howitzers.
[01:35:24] Big giant cannons. Less than a minute later and you got the company commander that's calling in
[01:35:32] calling in to tell them where to shoot these. Because in my office you can't see. There's no
[01:35:37] satellite back then. You can't see. So you're just going off of bearing in distance.
[01:35:43] Back to the book less than a minute later we heard the heavy ripping sound of the first round
[01:35:47] cutting the air over our heads. Atlanta to 100 yards of front in front of where Lee the
[01:35:52] captain and I stood. Stabs of flame, flame like lightning from a black cloud, leaped off the ground
[01:35:59] and we felt the earth tremble from the explosion. Close got damn it too close shout at the skipper.
[01:36:05] Then into the mic he said, add 3-0-0, repeat, add 3-0-0. So he's telling them that means add,
[01:36:12] it means shoot 300 meters further. The next round landed further away and we barely saw the
[01:36:20] stabs of flame. It was where the skipper wanted it. The enemy machine gun fire had stopped.
[01:36:26] The Chinese knew what would be coming at them. Repeat range. Give me concentration fire.
[01:36:33] Three valleys on my command. The concentration fire would saturate the area where the Chinese were
[01:36:40] concealed. The captain waited to give the order to fire until Sergeant King had positioned
[01:36:45] the covering squad in front of us. Fire! 22nds later the first rounds of the barrage landed
[01:36:52] less than 50 yards away. Short rounds. Meaning that the rounds didn't go as far as they were supposed
[01:37:00] to. We dove for the deck all of us, even Lee. The following rounds dropped among the front
[01:37:06] of the squad that first put to an had position to cover the company withdrawal. Screams from
[01:37:12] our own men, mud and flame and crashing thunder. The skipper yelled into the radio cease fire, cease fire,
[01:37:20] short rounds, short rounds. Friendly fire. The worst thing that can happen in combat are
[01:37:30] dismal day turned to horror. Crys and moans and agonized screams pierced the black smoke that
[01:37:38] drifted over the broken ground. Doc Mickens and Joe King were already working among the wounded
[01:37:45] and mangled dead marines. Bill Davis and Ed Topple, the other puttune corpsman sprinted across the
[01:37:52] field to help. Captain Wilcox yelled into the radio as the next line of shell was exploded.
[01:37:59] Now away from us farther to our front. They had been in the air before the gunners could comply
[01:38:05] with the order to cease fire. They did us no further damage but their noise added to the hellish
[01:38:10] scene. I arose shaken and not sure what to do. I saw Sergeant Wright at the edge of the field
[01:38:18] and called for him to bring the ammo carriers forward. We would use them to carry the casualties
[01:38:23] away. Joe Kersaba had already brought the company headquarters people to lend a hand with the
[01:38:29] grizzly work. We had four more dead and three wounded. Kersaba went to the skipper and said that we
[01:38:38] should get the company out of this place and back down the road. Captain shook his head a few times
[01:38:43] to clear it and thought about Joe's suggestion for several seconds. Then he got Kaiser and Lee
[01:38:50] on the walkie talkies and told them to prepare their puttunes to move back. He told me to walk a
[01:38:55] screen of H.E.'s 200 yards out to discourage any Chinese from following us. When I reported to him
[01:39:02] that the mortars were ready to do for the fire mission, I thought I saw tears coming down his face.
[01:39:07] Although it could have been the drizzling rain. Eight dead marines for the day, more wounded,
[01:39:13] and nothing accomplished. The rain and sleet turned to snow. Wet sticky stuff that coated the
[01:39:22] ponchos covering the dead men. The troops struggled down a wet slippery trail to the road,
[01:39:29] bearing the dead and wounded. They were soaked through and spoke no words except to blast
[01:39:36] them. The goddamn fool who sent us into this miserable wet cold country. Friendly fire, blue on blue.
[01:39:56] Think about it. Try and keep it in the front of your head. When you're in combat situations,
[01:40:03] try and keep it in the front of your head. Try and keep it as a real possibility. It's not impossible
[01:40:09] to have it happen. It's kind of like in fighting. When they say it's the punch that you didn't see,
[01:40:19] that's the one that's going to knock you out. It's the same thing in this situation.
[01:40:25] If you could see that a blue on blue is going to take place, you would stop it. You can't see it.
[01:40:32] It's not something that's going to be unexpected. That's why it happens. It happens because it's unexpected.
[01:40:39] And there's a lot of things that can happen when you start bringing artillery in. There's a bunch
[01:40:45] of variables there that are really hard to control. But it is, obviously, it's a nightmare. It's a
[01:40:56] nightmare. I was having this conversation with one of my silver buddies the other day. That's why
[01:41:04] you train hard. That's why you prepare for it. That's why you create chaos and confusion inside
[01:41:11] of your training. That you actually force blue on blue. You force blue on blue to happen.
[01:41:16] You force these fratricides situations to happen so that they happen in training so that they
[01:41:21] don't happen on the battlefield. It's the same thing with the police front. The police
[01:41:27] front, sometimes has blue on blue. Train hard, set up the crazy scenarios. Make people do
[01:41:34] unexpected things. They come down from that scenario and they get a day arrest. You might think,
[01:41:45] hey, you know, you took eight killed and multiple more wounded. I will give you some time off. They got
[01:41:50] time off one day, one day arrest and then they're back on the march. Back to the book, the column
[01:41:55] march north in a cold swirling wind that swept the road clear of snow. We put on the pond
[01:42:02] just again to help award off the wind. They soon froze stiff and crackled as we walked. And if you
[01:42:08] notice as they left that other situation, the rain turned to sleep in the snow. So that's like
[01:42:14] in one hour winter was here. And so now you're going to, now you're going to start hearing about
[01:42:18] the cold big time. The men were in a foul temper. What kind of stupid bastards we got running this
[01:42:26] goddamn war came from the column. Don't worry about them. Guys running this goddamn war. They're
[01:42:31] sitting by a stove someplace, sticking pins in their maps. Yeah. And they'll get their pick of
[01:42:38] cold weather gear before they send us, send it up to us, pour suckers. Guy in the battalion
[01:42:43] mess lines said them rear echelon bastards are already wearing big fur coats and winter issue
[01:42:48] boat boots. That's okay. We'll get the stuff next spring. Sure, what's left of it. By the time
[01:42:55] it gets to us, we'll be needing jungle gear. So these guys are just letting out their frustration
[01:43:01] and anger. The worst suffering that day came from our feet. We only had thin cotton socks
[01:43:10] under the boom dockers, little protection from the cold, especially as they were still damp
[01:43:16] under our leggings. We stomped away the freezing toes, the pain of the freezing toes, and kept
[01:43:22] the blood circulating. There were complaints of numbness. Some men felt as if they had
[01:43:28] pebbles in their socks. We didn't know about frostbite yet. If you don't know what boom
[01:43:37] dockers are, they're your basic, like the most basic form of a boot leather rubber sole. That's it.
[01:43:46] That's one of the boom dockers. They got cotton socks. Now they get some new gear.
[01:43:53] And one of the pieces that they get is called shoe packs. Going to the book, shoe packs
[01:43:58] would change the way we walked and bring us the crippling scourge of frostbite. They were big
[01:44:05] and cumbersome twice the weight of our boom dockers. They had thick molded rubber bottoms with
[01:44:10] heavily-created souls. The tops from the ankle up to the shin were made of stiff leather that
[01:44:17] lace tightly. shoe packs were clumsy for climbing, climbing and slippery on the ice. The worst
[01:44:24] thing about them, however, was that they were laced up when they were laced up no air could circulate.
[01:44:31] On a steep climb, on a long marsh, our feet would sweat no matter how cold it was. When we
[01:44:38] stopped moving and the cold said in, the sweat soaked felt inserts and socks would freeze.
[01:44:46] Long stretches of wet, frozen feet, spelled frostbite. I don't know if you remember this
[01:44:54] from the last one we did but I didn't include it. But one of the videos that they showed later
[01:45:00] to the soldiers and marines that were going over to Korea was to warn them of frostbite
[01:45:07] and it was the doctors with the frostbitten feet and they weren't surgically removing the toes.
[01:45:14] They would just break them off because they were frozen dead toes and they would just break
[01:45:19] and that's the video they showed them. Hey, keep your feet dry. But it was these poorly designed
[01:45:25] shoes was one of the problems that they tried. Oh, we'll make these guys these super warm boots.
[01:45:30] Doesn't it's not that easy? It's not that easy. You make them so warm and so waterproof
[01:45:34] no aeroscapes from them. Now you've got sweaty feet. Now your feet are going to freeze.
[01:45:41] Now we get this one of the replacements that comes in is a guy named Woody Taylor. You're going to
[01:45:46] hear a little bit about him and there's a little fireflank that takes place and Captain Wilcox,
[01:45:52] who's the company commander, maneuvers, some Woody Taylor's guys. He says, hey, you guys go check that
[01:45:57] out over there. Woody Taylor doesn't like it. Those are my men says Woody Taylor. So here we go.
[01:46:03] Captain Wilcox, Taylor called Louty Louty to the skipper. If you don't, I've used the word
[01:46:09] skipper a bunch. I should have explained what it is. Skipper means the commanding officer of the
[01:46:14] company just just like the skipper of a ship. Captain Wilcox, Taylor called Louty to the skipper.
[01:46:21] He was red face and out of breath from the run up the column. That's a squad from my
[01:46:26] platoon. You sent over there on the flank. Yeah, Louten it. I saw a few bandits over there.
[01:46:30] Captain, those are my men. Taylor interrupted. My platoon moves on my orders.
[01:46:37] Captain Wilcox glared at Louten it Taylor. I'd seen that cold look many times before
[01:46:43] when it had been leveled on me. I figured that Woody Taylor would not be long with Baker
[01:46:48] one seven. Our new lieutenant and the captain stared at each other. Woody calmed down a notch.
[01:46:54] Sir, he said, I'd much appreciate it. If you put any orders to my men through me. Colonel Davis
[01:47:01] set me up here to run this platoon. That's what I reckon to do. Taylor and the skipper were eyeballed
[01:47:08] to eyeball and the skipper realized that he had, indeed, violated the chain of command.
[01:47:14] Yeah, Louten it. He said, you're right. That's your platoon. And I guess we understand each other.
[01:47:25] I guess we do captain said Woody Taylor. All right, then carry on. The skipper dismissed his
[01:47:31] new platoon leader. We figured Woody Taylor was going to have what's going to be one hell of a fighter.
[01:47:37] He was the last replacement officer to come to Baker one seven and he was with us to stay.
[01:47:42] So a little standoff. But there's a lot of little things that go on there. Right. Number one,
[01:47:50] Taylor was too aggressive out of the gate. You know, hey, those were my guys. That was too aggressive.
[01:47:56] He was able to catch himself and back off and say, hey, sir, I really appreciate it.
[01:47:59] If he had come with that attitude from the beginning, he would have had a better chance of
[01:48:05] making what he wanted to have happen with no risk. There was a risk here. There was a risk here
[01:48:10] that Captain Louten called me to get shut up. It might be your platoon. It's my company.
[01:48:15] Don't talk to me about this again. He could have said that. But also, he's a good leader.
[01:48:21] That when got pressed on this, he said, let me touch. He said, getting mad. He was getting mad.
[01:48:27] He detached. He said, okay, wait a second. What's going on here? This young Louten,
[01:48:31] that's in charge of the platoon. I just ordered his guys around without telling him. Now he's mad about it.
[01:48:35] Does that make sense? Yes, it does. He's calm down. He's he's talking to me in a better
[01:48:40] tone now. He's just asking me that he's appreciated. I can accept that. I was a little outlined.
[01:48:45] Cool. Yep. You got it. And they were able to solve that problem. So it's a little dynamics.
[01:48:51] Some dynamics out on the battlefield going on.
[01:48:57] More firefighter happens. More madness going on. They get through the next situation. And now we
[01:49:05] have Colonel Davis again. This is the metal of honor winner who's who's in charge here.
[01:49:09] Back to the book. Colonel Davis came up to make her one seven to inform us that we were moving out again.
[01:49:15] Tomorrow morning we would advance up the west side of the chosen reservoir. Our objective was the
[01:49:21] town of Yudam Nee 14 miles away. This was not a patrol. Our battalion commander told us it was an attack
[01:49:31] and we should expect the fighting to get serious. So they haven't had any serious fighting, right?
[01:49:35] Oh, no. Yes, they have. But expected to get more serious. When he finished briefing the officers
[01:49:40] Colonel Davis asked me to bring Sergeant Wright to him. The hardship transfer order had finally
[01:49:46] come through and our Colonel wanted to say goodbye personally to a good Marine NCO.
[01:49:52] There was a great moment for Sergeant Wright. All the company officers were there.
[01:49:56] And the Colonel expressed his appreciation and best wishes to my departing Sergeant.
[01:50:00] Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant's added their own well-done Sergeant Wright had done a good job
[01:50:05] of whipping the mortar section into shape and keeping them square it away. The mortar has had a
[01:50:10] four farewell party for their Sergeant who had been up with them since the first day at Camp Pendleton.
[01:50:15] The rifle between Corman came by, makins and Davis and Toppo each bringing a canteen of sick
[01:50:21] bay alcohol. The skipper and Joe Kursaba joined us in for a few days. Tos. When he was ready to leave,
[01:50:29] weapon and gear all square it away like a proud, like a parade ground Marine,
[01:50:33] Sergeant Wright approached me. His eyes glistened, probably mine did too.
[01:50:39] Sir, I think we did some good with these people. I want to thank you for giving me a chance to
[01:50:44] serve in your outfit. Thank you, Sergeant Wright. You're a fine Marine NCO, God bless you and your family.
[01:50:52] Sergeant Wright snapped the salute at me and strode off. I would never seem again
[01:50:57] and I would miss him very much. Sergeant Wright had an home. I guess it was his time and he'd
[01:51:09] pushed on when we could have gone home a lot earlier but he pushed on and now they're getting
[01:51:14] ready to make this next move and he has his orders now in hand and orders are orders. So he
[01:51:19] heads up back to the book, the weather turned ugly again as we formed up to Resurm,
[01:51:25] resumed the attack to the north. A bitter cold wind greeted us filled with a stinging gritty snow.
[01:51:32] It was my birthday. After the troops were square it away, I crouched in the ditch alongside
[01:51:38] the road and took some time to go through my snapshots. I thought a Dorothy teaching the happy
[01:51:44] birthday song to the babies and how they would try and sing it. I saw their little pink cheeks
[01:51:52] and blue eyes and Dorothy's golden hair. Rough away from Spent his birthday and as you sit here
[01:52:06] today wherever you're listening to this, know that somewhere in the world there's an American
[01:52:11] serviceman that's out there celebrating their birthday in a similar manner. I guarantee it away
[01:52:17] from his family and his loved ones. What else does he get out for his birthday? He gets some enemy
[01:52:26] activity back to the book. The enemy fire became heavy about 50 Chinese were dug in against us
[01:52:32] and they were serious about defending this place. Lee took his platoon off the road to extend
[01:52:38] our firing line. Captain Wilcox came forward with Garcia and the big radio and set up in the ditch
[01:52:44] just behind Kaiser. I marveled at his easy, ambling gate during firefights. He always stood up straight.
[01:52:52] He's like JP. The static of the SCR 300 radio outed added to the pounding of our own
[01:52:59] machine guns and bars. Rifles cracked. Johnson's mortar bumped out HEs and enemy bullets
[01:53:07] zing through the air and spun off chips of boulders. Soon came the urgent cries. Corman, oh God,
[01:53:15] Corman! And the fear came. As it did to me on the onset of every fight, the Corman cries,
[01:53:22] the booming explosions and the wine of bullets blood-trenched parkas pierced God, not this time. Please.
[01:53:30] Platoon Sergeant King from Taylor's Platoon Crouch amongst some large boulders above me.
[01:53:35] He shouted down that there was a machine gun near the spike of rocks that marked the Chinese main
[01:53:39] position. I wield myself to climb up and get a better look. The fears submerged and the cold was
[01:53:48] forgotten. Overcome that fear take action. Now they continue in this little firefight and then finally
[01:53:59] we get enough talked about them before we get some air support some raincoirers,
[01:54:03] but we get some marines on the ground that are pilots. What we now call Anglico, the marines are on
[01:54:09] the ground, these are fighter pilots that go out and do infantry work and call for fire and so here
[01:54:15] we go back to the book Bob Wilson brought in the course airs that were on station to cover our
[01:54:20] advance. I called down to Burst to lay down a round of white phosphorus to mark the Chinese guns
[01:54:25] and the flyers came in on the calm of white smoke. They flew in low barely above us. They're
[01:54:31] great racketing noise overpowered all other sounds as they flashed by. On the first passes they
[01:54:37] fired the machine guns and cannons. These had a little effect the Chinese were dug into well.
[01:54:43] They followed with a napalm run, a spectacle of awesome and terrible beauty. The pods slid
[01:54:51] from the planes tumbled across the ground that exploded. Black smoke billowed and red flames
[01:54:58] leaped against the white snow and seconds later we felt the blast of heat that consumed the ground
[01:55:03] 200 yards away. Chinese soldiers were a flame running about in frenzied circles. They threw
[01:55:11] themselves flailing into the snow. There was sudden silence. The Chinese ceased fire and her own weapons
[01:55:19] were quiet. We were stunned by the power of that close end flaming strike.
[01:55:24] 200 yards away. That's not a big distance. I might seem like a big distance. That is not a
[01:55:32] big distance when you're in an airplane and you're coming down to drop Napalm and kill a bunch of
[01:55:37] people. That's a tiny distance. Marine Corps pilots is getting after it. It's called danger close
[01:55:44] by the way. So if you're going to call in an air strike that's close to your positions. You have
[01:55:49] to say on the radio. You say danger close. Meaning look, I know it's close by. You've got to do it.
[01:55:59] Go in. So they snifled out that one but guess what? The Chinese are far from done.
[01:56:05] Back to the book, the Chinese showed that they would not hibernate from the war because of the
[01:56:09] cold weather. The farther we advanced, the stiffer was their resistance. The hills continued to
[01:56:14] grow steeper and each climb we made and combed with the heavy clothing became its own ordeal.
[01:56:21] Most of our fights were put to insized, Kaiser or Lee or Taylor maneuvering up a slippy slippery
[01:56:28] snow-covered slope to dislodge a force of Chinese who fired at us down the road.
[01:56:33] So as they're moving down this road, they're just having to go into the high ground all the time and
[01:56:37] take out the Chinese. Here's a cool little anecdotal story. They get pinned down and Colonel Davis is
[01:56:48] there and they're trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to the book. Colonel Davis was at the
[01:56:53] head of our column with Captain Wilcox. When the Chinese opened up from across the chasm 300 yards
[01:56:59] away, the skipper called me up front. Can you knock out those guns? Captain Wilcox asked?
[01:57:04] He and the Colonel crouched their acknowledgement of machine gun slugs that tore into the slope above
[01:57:10] our heads. Yes, sir. I answered crouching alongside my two commanders. So there's a machine gun up on the
[01:57:17] hill and they can't get it with their guns but they wanted to get his mortar tubes up there
[01:57:21] and then drop mortar rounds on the machine gun position. So he yells out to his runner. So his runners
[01:57:27] is the guy that spreads word. He runs out to his runner. Kelly, bring up Johnson's gun. I commanded
[01:57:33] Hugo was with Kaiser's platoon leading the column that day. They were just behind the bend.
[01:57:40] I sir snapped my runner in a way to impress the Colonel. Colonel Davis and Captain Wilcox
[01:57:46] continued to scan the opposite slope. 11 o'clock said the Colonel indicating slight movement
[01:57:51] in an outcrapping of boulders. Yes, sir. I haven't. I told my Colonel as I located the enemy
[01:57:56] machine gun through my own binoculars. And another one at 10 o'clock 50 yards higher. Sir,
[01:58:00] good eyes Lieutenant said Colonel Davis. There was a sudden commotion behind us. The sound of
[01:58:07] marine singing as they double timed up the road. Kelly was leading the mortar men forward.
[01:58:14] And he had them sounding cadence with his parody of an army marking song, song, marching song,
[01:58:20] sound off. How can a mortar man survive following a man who's six foot five sound off?
[01:58:27] Put your rifles and machine guns away. The 60 mortars are all in the way. Sound off. Sound off.
[01:58:33] So they're in a firefight. They're pinned down. And these guys come running up the road singing
[01:58:38] cadence. And by the way, I forgot to mention this that Owen is six foot five. So that's where
[01:58:42] they're talking about. There was no ditch. So Hugo could not take cover from enemy fire while
[01:58:49] setting up his gun. He and Dean Westburg spread the bipod on the rear of on the rear edge of
[01:58:54] the flat open road surface. I stood behind the gun as they work quickly. The volume of bullets
[01:59:01] increased. 11 o'clock Hugo I said, give me three five zero. I fired a tracer from my shoulder.
[01:59:08] Westburg had a mortar round ready. Hugo with his sharp shooters eye spotted the target and said
[01:59:15] three five oh plus a hair. He laid the tube in the direction of the machine gun and cranked his elevation.
[01:59:21] Fire, he said to Westburg, the round fumped out and we followed its arc ignoring the Chinese bullets
[01:59:26] that were bouncing off the frozen surface of the road and the slope behind us. The first round
[01:59:31] was a direct hit. God bless you Hugo Johnson. Captain Wilcox called out for the platoon to continue
[01:59:39] the march. Colonel David approached the gun. He had a big smile. You tell your men they're shooting
[01:59:44] it right on lieutenant. He said, he glanced at our choir director Kelly and added, but tell him
[01:59:50] that their sing is way off key. Like I said, even having a good time in madness of fire flights.
[01:59:59] The cold is getting brutal. Back to the book, we seldom removed our knitted gloves that we
[02:00:05] wore under the canvas mittens. Bear fingers we found froze to metal. They froze to weapons,
[02:00:10] bayonets, buckles, whatever we touched. The cold forced the corpsmen to change their way of
[02:00:16] doing business. With the first sounds of a firefight they would take several serets of moraphone
[02:00:22] and put them into their mouths. This kept the moraphone liquid until the serets were jabbed into
[02:00:27] the wounded man's flesh to relieve his pain. The corpsmen were the only ones who worked with
[02:00:34] bare hands in the severe cold and they found a way to keep their fingers nimble while attending
[02:00:39] two wounded man. The heat of the man's blood did the trick or his guts as they were stuffed
[02:00:46] back into his belly. Freezing cold. Back to the book, despite our efforts to keep the men in clean
[02:01:03] dry socks we were losing the fight against frostbite which resulted from damp cold feet.
[02:01:08] The men would complain of pains or numbness in their feet and when they limped badly we sent
[02:01:14] them to batallion aid station. Many never returned. Some had waited too long to turn themselves in
[02:01:21] and by the time the doctors saw them their toes had become purplish black and had to be amputated.
[02:01:29] Because the ground was frozen hard digging good fighting holes was nearly impossible.
[02:01:34] Digging in became a matter of chipping a shallow pit in the unyielding earth beneath the snow
[02:01:42] then barricading it with rocks or tree branches. If any dead Chinese were found on the hill
[02:01:48] we added their stiff corpses to the barricades. To make level places for their guns the
[02:01:55] mortament took turns at the concrete like dirt within trenching tools and combat knives.
[02:02:06] And they're continuing in this freezing cold. They get to a point where they're
[02:02:18] in sort of an open area and we'll go to the book. The Chinese maneuvered down from the red
[02:02:23] giants all around us. They ran across the snow in squad columns then formed firing lines among
[02:02:29] the boulders or prone in the snow. Chinese mortars began to fall on us in the CP which was 50 yards
[02:02:38] or us and the CP which was 50 yards behind us. Around exploded close by and lifted me off the ground.
[02:02:45] I was days for a while and when full awareness returned Kelly had me by the arm leading me
[02:02:51] toward the CP. Where we'd go and Kelly I didn't understand why we were heading away from the line.
[02:02:57] Get a corpsman to look at you. I thought you were a goner back there. He pointed to my
[02:03:01] park of flapping around my knees. It had strapped in the holes in it. They don't get closer than
[02:03:07] that deterring your balls off. It's a good thing you got me around Lieutenant. The corpsman at the
[02:03:12] CP was far too busy with the seriously wounded to tend to my mild concussion. The casualties
[02:03:18] lay in blanket covered rose. Dr. Skis Davis and Toppil, those of the corpsman went from one to the
[02:03:26] other. They jabbed Moraphine, slowed bleeding, cleaned out holes, blasts and flashed, patched them
[02:03:31] and wrapped them as best they could. The corpsman had their mouth filled with mouths filled with
[02:03:37] serets of Moraphine and their bare hands were bloody. When they worked with enemy mores exploding,
[02:03:44] bullets stabbing the air too feet above them. Week frightened voices called for their help.
[02:03:51] Doc Mickons from 1st Patoon took some shrapnel then a 25 and then a slug.
[02:03:57] In the leg where he was patching the wounded in action on Woody Taylor's line. The stretcher bearer's
[02:04:03] drag Mickons to the CP and lay them in the line of casualties. Next to him, damming the Chinese
[02:04:08] and his Arkansas draw was Sergeant King who had been blasted by grenades and hit by a burp gun.
[02:04:15] Paul Rendon, a machine gunner with the Patoon lay there too, a leg shot up.
[02:04:21] The first Patoon's, the first Patoon was being rapidly depleted and was having a hell of a fight
[02:04:28] holding their end to their perimeter. So these guys were, you know, perimeter like I said in
[02:04:36] sort of an open area and the Chinese just come down and they're, you know, full on attack on them,
[02:04:41] full on. Back to the book, the afternoon light faded and we were worried about whether the ammo
[02:04:47] would run out. The Chinese had fully encircled us. Their volume of fire was just enough to keep us
[02:04:54] pinned down. They would wait for dark than swarm over our lines. They had plenty of people to do the
[02:05:01] job. Our bandettes were fixed and our grenades ready. Every man had a target sector and we kept
[02:05:09] fire discipline to conserve ammo. We began to settle in and wait for dark. As bullets zinged,
[02:05:18] grenades exploded and Marines cried for help. Someone yelled out that cop captain Wilcox had
[02:05:24] been hit. He had taken a bullet to the face and a piece of shrapnel and shattered his arm.
[02:05:29] Joe Kersaba took over as our skipper. As soon as we heard about the captain we ran to the
[02:05:35] CP, we found him there as head wrapped in a big white ball of a bandage unable to speak. His blood
[02:05:42] soaks sleeve dangled beside him. He kept struggling to get on his feet when the docks put him down
[02:05:49] on his spread out poncho. After a while the morphine kicked in and the skipper nodded off
[02:05:55] groaning softly. Before they stabilized the line around us, the Chinese pushed the first
[02:06:02] platoon back almost to the CP. So you got the platoon. The CP is the kind of like the brains of the
[02:06:10] unit. They got the different pltunes or out in a perimeter in 360 degrees and in the center of that
[02:06:15] you got the command post, the CP and you have the radio men in there. You have the people that are
[02:06:20] going to do fire support, maybe the mortar sections in there and then you have the leadership
[02:06:25] is in that CP. But now we start to see that the pltunes are getting pushed back towards the CP.
[02:06:32] They're losing their perimeter. Just as Joe Kersaba came in to take over command to the company,
[02:06:38] Roti Taylor stormed in demanding that we get the hell out of here. The gooks have all the
[02:06:43] high ground. They got us surrounded. He boomed. They're going to pick us to pieces tonight.
[02:06:48] Joe Kersaba answered him quietly. We need air support to run at your fairs for us. Then we might
[02:06:55] be able to make a break for the road. They better get to work mighty fast said, Woody, we only have
[02:07:00] a few minutes of daylight left. So there's Joe Kersaba's keeping it cool. Again, World War II vet
[02:07:06] now just out here getting after it. And that's what they need. So what they need is they need
[02:07:14] the coarserers to come in, which if you don't know the coarserers on awesome aircraft, World War II
[02:07:19] vintage and you can tell them because they have very distinctive wings that have a distinctive
[02:07:25] bend in them and they're very, very distinctive looking aircraft and obviously very good at
[02:07:32] close air support. Back to the book, all afternoon, Joe Hedrick, the air controller, had attempted
[02:07:38] to get a piece of the air support dedicated to the fifth marine. So there was air craft working on
[02:07:43] another group of Marines, working for another group of Marines. Now in the remaining minutes of
[02:07:48] daylight, he called a flight of four-care coarsers in search of action. Then he calls those things
[02:07:56] and gets them on the horn, calls them in and here we go. The four coarsers streaked in a little
[02:08:02] bubble us pointing themselves at the Chinese positions less than 100 yards away. They drop
[02:08:08] their big earth shaking bombs and they skate the long deep valley with rockets and heavy
[02:08:14] caliber slugs. The Chinese took cover and we moved out. So that's cover move once again.
[02:08:23] All they needed to do to get out of the situation was they needed someone to cover for their
[02:08:27] movement. That's what they needed and they couldn't supply it themselves. They're shooting uphill.
[02:08:30] Didn't have the firepower. Income the coarsers to get after it and give them cover to move.
[02:08:36] Back to the book, I lost ground in that day. The lad who had tried hard to be a good combat
[02:08:43] marine. He was running toward me carrying a helmet filled with grenades taken from the wounded
[02:08:48] when a bullet tore through his throat. The shot didn't knock him down at first, just through his
[02:08:54] head back and I saw a fountain of blood spurt from his neck. He staggered a few steps, then fell
[02:09:01] face forward in the snow which quickly turned red. When I got to him, he was already dead.
[02:09:10] It took hours more for a baker one seven to make its way the mile down the road.
[02:09:16] Colonel Davis brought elements of Charlie Company out to meet us. We loaded our dead and wounded
[02:09:22] on waiting trucks and sent them back to you down knee. The Chinese had cut off the MSR that's a
[02:09:29] main supply route between you Domny and Haga Ruiri, the Colonel and Ford Bus. So now they are
[02:09:36] truly trapped. On the march back into the you Domny perimeter, past midnight, the men were silent,
[02:09:44] spent from this cold brutal day. And Captain Wilcox had been a good skipper.
[02:09:52] When they get there, Lee was waiting for us when we staggered into you Domny perimeter.
[02:10:00] Many of the men limped with the first stages of frostbite and there were some walking wounded
[02:10:05] who had elected this day with the company. Undisguised tears ran down Lee's face when he saw
[02:10:12] the column make its way in. And that was the reason that Lee wasn't with them was because he
[02:10:21] literally got ordered to that he couldn't go because his arm was becoming infected. And he was
[02:10:27] he could not. They would not let him go. And so he's there and undisguised tears ran down his
[02:10:33] face as he saw the column make its way in. Joe Kersobber formed us up at first light while the
[02:10:39] course airs were blazing at enemy hills. He told us that we were going to aid going to the
[02:10:45] aid of Charlie Company which had been posted on Turkey Hill to guard the MSR. Last night after
[02:10:51] we marched away from that area that Chinese had poured out of the hills and surrounded Charlie.
[02:10:57] Charlie was fighting for its life when we went to pull them out. So there's a
[02:11:01] small company of Marines, Charlie Company, and they are surrounded.
[02:11:08] They go up and one of the, one of the Abel Company, so you got Abel Baker and Charlie,
[02:11:18] Abel Company sets up on the flank and then Baker also patrols up and kind of sets up to
[02:11:25] to come to their aid back to the book. Through my binoculars I had a good view of Charlie's perimeter.
[02:11:30] 400 yards away. They were in a tight circle, not more than 75 yards across halfway up the slope
[02:11:37] of Turkey Hill. Chinese machine guns and rifles infested the hill around them firing at any
[02:11:43] Marine who moved. Charlie's people were thoroughly pinned down. So picture this a little circle.
[02:11:49] See, all your whole company, maybe there's a hundred, maybe there could be a hundred,
[02:11:52] fifty but I think they've taken a bunch of wounded at this point. They got a hundred guys in a
[02:11:55] little, seventy, five meter circle. And you're all pinned down and no matter every time you move,
[02:12:00] every time it gets stuck up you're getting shot at. Back to the book, Lee put his machine guns
[02:12:06] on the Chinese who were firing into Charlie's perimeter from the lower slope. My three mortars
[02:12:11] had the same target. Abel's machine gun and mortars rake the hill above the perimeter. Soon our
[02:12:16] tracer's lying the sky and puffs of black smoke from the mortars dotted the rocky hill.
[02:12:22] Then the big shells from artillery and the battalions 81 started to fall and the hill rocked
[02:12:27] with their explosions. Chinese soldier's scurried for cover. My classmate pay attention to this.
[02:12:35] My classmate Jin Stemple led Abel's assault down the ridge line and into the Chinese.
[02:12:42] The enemy soldiers had their heads down from the heavy covering fire once again covering fire
[02:12:48] and Stemple's platoon tore into them. Through the binoculars I observed one squad of
[02:12:54] Temples Marines led by a giant of a man in a flapping parka who swung a huge double-headed axe.
[02:13:02] The Chinese soldiers seeing this great maniacal devil charged at them branding,
[02:13:10] brandishing a bloody axe abandoned their positions in terror.
[02:13:16] So there you have it. I never, I never, I don't even know where you get a battle axe in the
[02:13:23] Missed the Korean War but this Marine right here attacks the Chinese, not with grenades, not with a
[02:13:31] bar, not with a machine gun, he attacks with a freaking battle axe.
[02:13:40] Back to the book the Chinese quickly lifted their siege of Charlie Company and made a rapid retreat
[02:13:44] from Turkey hill. As they fled Abel companies down hill assault they had to cross baker's line of fire.
[02:13:51] Woody Taylor's platoon had come up to extend our line and every weapon we had was trained on the
[02:13:57] Chinese as they ran to the protecting slopes on the other side of the valley. Turkey shoot at
[02:14:02] Turkey hill are people called it. We were at rapid fire with the mortars and machine gun,
[02:14:07] and machine guns the bars, and the rifles even co-vars rocket launcher.
[02:14:14] A few Chinese made it all the way across the gauntlet of exploding flame and steel.
[02:14:19] They dropped and heaps even before the Australian planes came down on them. We hadn't worked with
[02:14:24] the Australians before and they were out to prove that they were gun-ho is our own Marine core pilots.
[02:14:30] They came roaring low along the valley from behind us and when they passed above these glowing
[02:14:36] pink vest they dropped even closer to the ground. They're they're low enough to cut off the
[02:14:41] Qing's pig tails, Kelly quipped. The planes had their blood, their guns blazing and the
[02:14:47] Chinese went down in bunches. The Australians made two passes at the end of their second
[02:14:53] low level assault. There were no Chinese soldiers left to shoot at. It took almost every able body
[02:15:01] man that Charlie Company had to bring down their dead and wounded. Their overnight defense of
[02:15:07] Turkey hill had cost dearly. And they got one more rescue mission basically to do. There was a
[02:15:19] Fox company is now in another situation in a horrible scenario and first Baker 17 needs to get to them.
[02:15:33] And it is a treacherous, treacherous movement and they decide, you remember early in the book,
[02:15:41] you said, you know, we weren't used to night fighting. They'd mostly worked during the day.
[02:15:46] Well, they decide that they need to do this at night. So they go on this patrol at night.
[02:15:52] Going back to the book. Under the heavy parkours our bodies
[02:15:56] swedded with the strain but our hands and feet were frozen numb. The wind borne cold attacked
[02:16:02] with terrible fury. When we stopped for bearings we stood silent and motionless.
[02:16:08] Because we needed to maintain silence we could not slap our hands against our sides or
[02:16:13] stomp our feet for circulation. The cold nodded our toes and fingers and ate into our bodies.
[02:16:20] The sweat we generated while climbing froze against our skin. We shivered violently,
[02:16:26] men muttered through their clenched teeth. We somehow got dimmed or freezing a death here.
[02:16:32] And they pushed on. I returned to the side of the column. Many men had collapsed in the snow
[02:16:37] curled into balls like Eskimo dogs. NCOs moved along the fallen, prodding and kicking, urging
[02:16:44] them to their feet. I collided with another Marine, churning forward through the snow. Both of us
[02:16:49] fell and as we weirdly recovered I realized that I had knocked down Colonel Davis.
[02:16:55] What's the hold-up lieutenant? Was all my battalion commander said that he continued breaking
[02:16:59] through the snow to the head of the column. Time had no meaning. We labored through infinite
[02:17:06] darkness and ghostly clouds of snow over an icy path that rose in fell but seemed to lead nowhere.
[02:17:15] We saw only the back of a man's head, a hunched figure in a long, shapeless parka whose every
[02:17:21] tortured step was an act of will. We carried on with the only strength that was left to us.
[02:17:32] Marine Corps discipline. They finally get within range after this brutal freezing march.
[02:17:49] And here we go the night exploded with the flash and sound of the fight.
[02:17:54] The Marines had the advantage of surprise and momentum. They fought with fierce energy
[02:17:59] now released from hours of cold and misery. The Chinese could do little more than try to escape.
[02:18:06] Many of them were unarmed and most ran off to the south so the the Chinese run.
[02:18:13] There's some firing, there's some shooting but it's pretty much a route because they had gone
[02:18:19] at night and they had pushed hard and they had that surprise and violence of action.
[02:18:23] Back to the book, Dawn arrived, Gray and cold and we jumped off the second phase of the
[02:18:30] breakthrough, able and Baker attacked online headed out for Fox Hill a thousand yards away.
[02:18:37] Minutes after we moved out, Kaiser's puttune on the left walked into heavy small arms
[02:18:42] machine gun fire from a ridge on his flank. The 60s responded with HE on the ridge and Kaiser's
[02:18:49] people broke through the deep snow to mount the hill. When they near the ridge line we lifted
[02:18:54] mortar fire and the platoon drove through the enemy's position on its own firepower,
[02:18:58] cover and move added again. We were astonished by our first view of Fox Hill.
[02:19:03] The snow field that led up to the embattled company's position was covered with hundreds of dead
[02:19:09] Chinese soldiers. Many of them seemed to sleep under blankets of drifted snow but their bodies were
[02:19:15] frozen in spasms of pain. There were jumbles of corpses in padded green uniforms. A white
[02:19:24] clad column had fallen in the formation that had attracted the attention of Fox companies'
[02:19:29] machine gunners. Creators of dirt and snow made by the big guns were rimmed with bodies and parts
[02:19:36] of men. Thick bands of dead Chinese lay at the base of Fox Company's perimeter.
[02:19:43] We stood in wonder. Men bowed their heads in prayer, some felt to their knees,
[02:19:50] other breath quiet oaths of disbelief. Tears came to the eyes of raggedy marines who had
[02:19:59] endured bitter cold and savage battle to reach this place of suffering and courage.
[02:20:05] Some one let loose a wild cheer and broke forward in a jubilant run. Across the snow covered
[02:20:15] and corpse-filled battlefield, the marines of Fox Company waved brightly colored banners.
[02:20:20] The blue yellow and red remnants of the parachute drops that had sustained them for nearly a week.
[02:20:27] Around their perimeter, Fox Company had constructed barricades of frozen Chinese bodies.
[02:20:32] From behind these walls of the, from behind these walls of dead, the marines had mounted their
[02:20:41] weapons and maintained a fight against an enemy whose numbers never ceased.
[02:20:47] Now the men of Fox Company arose from behind these gruesome piles to join us.
[02:20:51] Arms slings and bloods soaked compresses were common among them. Men hobbled about with
[02:20:58] makeshift leg splints, all hands were haggard and dirty as were we. We exchanged profane
[02:21:06] greetings that did not conceal the love that we marines felt for each other.
[02:21:12] Some came out and marines appeared along the skylines to the north.
[02:21:18] Then we saw marines marching down the MSR towards us. There were columns of riflemen at first,
[02:21:24] followed by a long trail of vehicle and vehicles and artillery pieces. Our corsairs swooped in
[02:21:30] close, their crooked wings wagging and salute. The fifth and seventh marines had broken out of
[02:21:37] you down knee. Now they broke out. They have a path but they still have to go 14 miles to get out of there.
[02:21:49] Back to the book, all the platoon sergeants had been hit. As were most of the squad leaders,
[02:21:56] we had corpoles and private stepping into leadership billets but they were combat experience marines
[02:22:02] and they knew the work. The marine column that came out of the besieged, you down knee,
[02:22:08] had hundreds of jeeps, ambulances and trucks as well as the big guns of the artillery regiment.
[02:22:14] Many of the trucks were filled with wounded men and some were stacked with the corpses of our own
[02:22:19] killed in action. The walking wounded, so now you got to picture this column, like almost like a mad
[02:22:24] max looking column. The walking wounded who could carry a weapon were turned to as riflemen to protect
[02:22:31] the column. Every man who could walk, hobble or limp was ordered off the trucks. The only riders were
[02:22:38] those serious cases, the gut wounds and blinded men along with severe leg wounds and men with
[02:22:45] frostbite so bad that they would need amputation. Many of the wounded died in the trucks,
[02:22:52] some froze to death and some were shot by the infiltrators. The 14 mile ride was three days
[02:23:00] and nights of grim survival. The rifle companies of the 5th and 7th marine stayed in the hills
[02:23:10] guarding the MSR as the column pulled in to Haggarooi. The garrison town came out to meet the
[02:23:19] bedrackled marines who had run the 14 mile gauntlet of fire and ice. As the walking wounded
[02:23:28] came within sight of the town, someone commanded them to fall into ranks. Maybe it was the
[02:23:35] limping sergeant who gave the command the old salt who had set the defenses along bob fishers
[02:23:40] stretch the column. It could have been fathered griffin or sergeant winged or corpora burr us,
[02:23:46] or corporal Johnson. The wounded men and some who were unharmed but who staggered from exhaustion
[02:23:55] formed up into three files, showed their weapons and marched in ragged step.
[02:24:01] Slowly the tread of their thick rubber sold patch shoe packs on the icy road became a steady
[02:24:08] sure cadence and the haggard and hurt marines put their heads high. Captain Wilcox who couldn't
[02:24:18] carry a weapon was in the forward ranks. His arm was in a huge cast and splinted so it was horizontal
[02:24:25] to the deck. His head and face were a cocoon of bandages but holding himself erect he picked up
[02:24:32] the cadence and marched standing straight into hogaroo rea. A battalion sergeant of the time
[02:24:41] sergeant took time away from the hundreds of wounded men he tended in the aid station to witness
[02:24:48] the columns arrival those bastards. Those magnificent bastards were the words the doctor used
[02:24:57] to describe the worn and torn marines from you down name.
[02:25:07] And I want you to I want you to picture that image that image of these hundreds of men just
[02:25:16] battered wounded barely even able to walk frostbitten and they're meandering into camp and when
[02:25:24] they get close someone says hey fall in and they fall into ranks and they begin to march.
[02:25:37] Will that's human will and its human will under the power of leadership and he doesn't even
[02:25:44] know who gave that order. Somebody said fall in the ranks it's the right thing to do and they do it.
[02:25:52] They find more they find they dig deeper to fall into ranks and hold their heads high as they walk
[02:26:01] back into town back to the book. Except for the road we had opened, Hagaroo rea was
[02:26:11] under siege surrounded by many thousands of Chinese soldiers they had been held off by a battalion
[02:26:16] of the first marines and hundreds of rear echelon people who had reverted to riflemen.
[02:26:23] For three days and nights the cooks and bakers truck drivers and artillerymen
[02:26:28] office, pinkies and technicians dug in alongside infantry marines.
[02:26:34] They threw back every thrust the Chinese made against the Hagaroo rea perimeter.
[02:26:39] American soldiers were there too army technical support people who picked up rifles and
[02:26:46] bars and went up the hills and filled in the marine lines. Wherever there were gaps the artillery
[02:26:52] threw in massive bombardments. During daylight hours the corsairs flew in low with bombs
[02:26:59] rockets and napoms to help hold the attackers at bay. The three divisions of Chinese who tried to
[02:27:06] isolate the fifth and seventh marines plus those had been at Fox Hill followed us south.
[02:27:14] And now they added their numbers to the encirclement of Hagaroo rea. The single road the MSR
[02:27:21] to Koto rea and our only way out was cut off. The hills that flanked that road were high and steep
[02:27:30] and there were as many Chinese embedded in them as their head been at Udomni so they're still
[02:27:36] completely surrounded. All this stuff is happening there's still surrounded.
[02:27:45] The engineers with their heavy earth moving equipment had dynamited the frozen ground and
[02:27:50] leveled an airfield large enough for cargo planes to fly in and out of Hagaroo rea. Air force
[02:27:55] pilots flew in the big clumsy planes loaded with replacements, rations and ammunition.
[02:28:02] For the return trip they filled the planes with the most seriously wounded. When they landed and
[02:28:10] took off they had to fly low between the hills that lined the valley the planes became slow
[02:28:15] moving targets for the Chinese guns and the hills and everyone that left Hagaroo rea was
[02:28:22] perforated with bullet holes. The man on the ground marveled at the courage of the Air Force
[02:28:28] pilots who kept flying in and out of there. So you got just cargo pilots flying into this place
[02:28:35] insanity. Now, they're in a position on a perimeter because just because they survived all that they
[02:28:50] still going to go back out in the whole perimeter. They get out to hold perimeter and here we go
[02:28:54] back to the book through my glasses. I saw a calm of 15 riflemen marching toward us out of Hagaroo rea.
[02:29:00] There were two files of them moving at a brisk pace alongside the road. But alongside both sides
[02:29:05] of the road, they wore crisp white parkas and swung their arms smartly. Because they were clean
[02:29:11] shape and an energetic way assumed they were fresh replacements flown in from the air strip.
[02:29:16] We found out later that these clean and junky troops were royal British marines
[02:29:20] who had fought their way into Hagaroo rea from the south. They too had found the MSR blocked
[02:29:27] and they had punched through the Chinese forces far superior to them in number.
[02:29:33] They were the 41st commando a unit that roughly compared in size to one of our own rifle
[02:29:38] companies. Like us, these marines had suffered heavy casualties. The Royal Marine calm
[02:29:44] halted and spread into ditches along the road near our CP. A freshly groomed young officer
[02:29:51] strode toward Kelly, topple and me. With the young officer was a grizzled sergeant whose proper
[02:29:57] military bearing could have come straight from the pages of kippling. The sergeant had a meticulously
[02:30:03] trimmed broad mustache that would have stirred guinea bucklies out envy. Like the lieutenant,
[02:30:10] the sergeant was dazzling clean and square to away. By binoculars hung around my neck which is
[02:30:16] how the lieutenant distinguished me as an officer. Certainly there was little other difference
[02:30:21] among Kelly and topple and me. Our partners were all stained with blood, food, gun oil, dirt.
[02:30:30] Our filthy faces were matted with bristly beards that bore icicles of mucus and spittle.
[02:30:36] The lieutenant concealed his disdain for our appearance, braced himself and delivered a broad
[02:30:43] hand salute. I say sir, we've ordered to extend up a troll beyond your lines.
[02:30:50] I'm to get up the covering machine guns and I would be most grateful for your suggestions.
[02:30:55] I appreciated the British lieutenant's courtesy and if I possessed a rager, I would have
[02:31:01] shaved on the spot to make myself more presentable. One of the reasons I included this because
[02:31:07] people always ask me, you know, you ever worked with any other militarys and I've worked with
[02:31:11] the British and people say you know how worthy. Well this is how the British are. The British
[02:31:17] are outstanding. The British are so professional. It's so impressive. They're like impeccable.
[02:31:25] Just the way they're described. That's the way the British are. That's the way the British
[02:31:28] military is. They're outstanding. Back to the book, the Royal Marine Lieutenant in his sergeant
[02:31:34] followed me to our machine gun positions and they checked out the fields of fire for their
[02:31:38] own mission. As we walk the line together, we exchanged observations about fighting the Chinese.
[02:31:44] The British lieutenant knew what he was talking about. Cock a little bit about the army units.
[02:31:51] The army outfits that went east to the reservoir were hurriedly patched together and poorly
[02:31:57] equipped for their mission. The artillery and tanks that were to support their advance were not
[02:32:03] organized in time to accompany them when they moved north of how out of Hago Ruiri. The heavy
[02:32:09] weapons that aided the Marine break out west of the reservoir were not there for the army.
[02:32:15] And many of the soldiers in that fight had not yet received cold weather gear, scores of them
[02:32:20] froze to death. It was the army's bad fortune too that a large number of its officers and
[02:32:27] experienced NCOs had been knocked out of the battle at the onset. The two senior commanders
[02:32:34] are Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel were killed at the front of their troops. Most of the
[02:32:40] company commanders and platoon leaders went down in a short time the casualties of all ranks
[02:32:45] outnumbered the able-bodied and some of the wounded had to be left behind. Platoons and squads
[02:32:52] do enthalled to a few men and coalesced into small bands that fought until their ammunition was gone.
[02:33:00] Those who could walk or crawl then made their way back across the frozen reservoir to the marine
[02:33:06] lines at Hago Ruiri. For the soldiers it was a disastrous fight but it had one good effect.
[02:33:13] The Chinese division that mold them was aimed at the attack on Hago Ruiri.
[02:33:19] The fight the soldiers put up on the east side of the reservoir had slowed their advance
[02:33:25] and that bought valuable time for the Marines. When the army survivors made their way into
[02:33:31] Hago Ruiri, those who could still carry on were re-equipped and formed into a professional
[02:33:37] battalion that became part of the first Marine division. They fought alongside us for the
[02:33:43] remainder of the campaign. Now like I said at this point, they're still surrounded and they need to
[02:33:57] now break out to get south to a town called Hung Nam where there's a port where they're going to be
[02:34:03] extracted. They're going to be pulled out. Back to the book, one seven, Arbatalion and two seven
[02:34:08] were to lead the break out from Coto Rhee. One seven was to take the high ground east of the road,
[02:34:16] two seven the west, four miles on the MSR, the Chinese had blown out a bridge over a deep chasm.
[02:34:23] The battalion of first Marines coming from the south would take the ground that commanded the other
[02:34:29] side of that gap. Then the engineers were put in a new bridge beyond that was a full army division.
[02:34:37] The third waiting to give us cover. After we cross the bridge, the army would take over the fighting.
[02:34:45] All we needed to do was get a few more divisions, get through a few more divisions of Chinese soldiers.
[02:34:52] So even on the division level, 10,000 were talking cover move, even on the division level. So it's
[02:34:57] an individual thing. It's a squad thing. It's a platoon thing. It goes all the way up to the division
[02:35:02] level because they need to have the cover of the army to get out of there. Here we go.
[02:35:08] Able company went out in front. The Chinese, the waiting Chinese immediately put down a sheet of fire,
[02:35:15] mortars, machine guns, burp guns, rifles. Able's casualties soon started to return.
[02:35:22] We huddled against the blowing clouds of snow and prayed to God that Able wouldn't get so badly
[02:35:28] mold that we would have to take their place. Our prayers were not answered.
[02:35:36] Battalion ordered us to pass through Able and continue the attack. Although it was daylight,
[02:35:41] we could barely see where we were going. The Chinese did not need to see us. There was only one
[02:35:48] way for us to get at them straight along the road. They had our broach well marked and covered
[02:35:56] with their weapons. As soon as we went past Able, the Chinese mortars began to drop and their
[02:36:01] machine guns opened. The tracers were weird streaks of orange that flew out of the blinding snow clouds.
[02:36:09] Our new corpsmen was quickly put to work. The Chinese were shooting down from a hill that flanked
[02:36:17] woody as well as from straight ahead. Jody didn't want to send anyone up that hill,
[02:36:22] fearing he would lose them in the heavy snow. You're just getting shot at them. There's clouds
[02:36:27] up there at altitude and so you're just getting shot from snow. It's like a cloud that's shooting
[02:36:31] machine gun fire at you. It's a nightmare. Back to the book we were getting nowhere. Joke or
[02:36:37] Saba was standing alongside the road behind Lee's platoon. He called me over to him. Bullet
[02:36:43] zingden's shrapnel wind around us but Joe stood straight and I stood with him. He had decided
[02:36:49] to risk a move up the hill on a left flank. Move your platoon up there Joe. By the way,
[02:36:54] at this point Joe had taken over a platoon. He was no longer in just in charge of the mortars. Now one
[02:36:58] of the sergeants was in charge of the mortars. So he's now in charge of a rifle platoon.
[02:37:03] Move your platoon up there. Joe he instructed me. See if you can take those guns out. They're
[02:37:07] killing us. He spread out his mat and trace the route. Spread out his map and trace the route that I
[02:37:13] was to follow. He fell silent. A Chinese bullet had found its target. Just below the rim of his
[02:37:22] helmet in the center of his forehead. A small black hole appeared there. Joe Kersobba's dead eyes
[02:37:29] stared at me for several seconds before he slump slowly to the ground. I caught him in my arms as
[02:37:36] he fell and held him for a moment. Then I lowered him gently into the snow. Jesus God.
[02:37:43] Joe Kersobba, my friend Joe who would help me so much, show me so much who had gone to bat for me
[02:37:50] with Captain Wilcox who had been my big brother. Joe Kersobba, whom I loved.
[02:38:00] Taking the mat from his mitten hands, I went forward to give it to Lee and informed him that
[02:38:06] he was the new company commander. On the way over, I got on my walkie talkie to tell Betelian that Kersobba
[02:38:13] was KIA. Their CP was close behind and the walkie talkie worked. Through the murk, I spotted Lee's
[02:38:21] vest. He was walking the line behind his men who were prone in the snow covering 50 yards of front.
[02:38:28] Luke Machini with the bar was with him. I felt alone without Kelly. The Chinese fire was passing
[02:38:36] overhead high. The enemy couldn't see us either. Kersobba's dead. I told Lee, caught one in the head.
[02:38:43] Damn. Was all Lee said in response. You're the new skipper I added. Giving him the map.
[02:38:51] Joe told me to go up the hill on Woody's flank. See if I can get around those guns and take them
[02:38:56] out. You still want me to do that. We must do something Lee said. They're killing us up from up there.
[02:39:02] That's what Joe said. Yes, see what you can do. Is your radio working? Yeah, I just talked to Betelian
[02:39:08] on it. Okay, let me know the situation when you make it and when you're ready to attack. If we can
[02:39:11] get our artillery, I don't want you to run into friendly fire. I, I skipper, I said,
[02:39:18] first Lieutenant Lee gave me a ironic little smile at that.
[02:39:22] So they're going to go up this hill and try and take out that machine gun and as they're going
[02:39:29] up the hill, he starts hearing something. Someone called from behind us. Sir, Lieutenant owned Owen.
[02:39:36] It was Woody Taylor's runner. He was breathing hard from the effort. He had made to catch up with us.
[02:39:41] Sir, Lieutenant Taylor wants you back down with the company. Lieutenant Lee's been hit.
[02:39:45] And Lieutenant Taylor wants you. On the double, he says, damn it to hell. I might have been able
[02:39:50] to roll the Chinese from the flank and take out the guns that were holding back the company.
[02:39:54] I tried to get Woody on my walkie-talkie. I got more static. I waved for Morrison to rejoin us
[02:40:03] and the tiny platoon slipped and slid back down the hill. As they came behind me, the men
[02:40:09] cursed and complained about the second Lieutenant's making up their mind. Woody Taylor waited
[02:40:15] for us at the base of the slope. He was senior to me in rankin with Lee down. He was our new company
[02:40:20] commander. He said that battalion had sent up a pair of tanks and their firepower would cover
[02:40:26] a frontal assault up the hill. So here we go. Finally, we get tanks and anyone that doesn't know.
[02:40:32] I am a huge fan of tanks. I love tanks and all you tankers out there. Thank you for being out there
[02:40:41] for these ground pounders. So he gained the old school tanks that little phone on the back of the
[02:40:47] tank to talk to the guys that were inside the tank. He picks up that tank as they get prepared to do
[02:40:53] this assault. And he says, put your 30s up below the ridge. Goak machine gun to 10 o'clock. Then
[02:40:57] I might command hit them with the cannons. We'll jump off on that. A tiny voice came from within the tank.
[02:41:04] Here you loud and clear the 30 caliber twin machine guns of both tanks. Begin their jack hammer
[02:41:11] pounding. I watch red tracer stabbing up the snow covered hill toward the dug in Chinese gun
[02:41:18] that we could now see dimly. Now they under that firepower they start to attack. Our line
[02:41:25] moved up the hill. 25 yards above me. Two Chinese soldiers appeared from behind a large boulder.
[02:41:32] One had a rifle, the other a burp gun. As I swung my car being toward them, I heard a grunt from
[02:41:38] Lu Pechini. He fired his bar straight into the air and he fell forward in the snow. He did not move
[02:41:45] and I knew he was dead. The best bar man we had got damn it. You've lost Lu Pechini.
[02:41:52] I couldn't get my weapon on the two Chinese above me fast enough. The one with a rifle put
[02:41:57] around in my left shoulder that spun me around. It's impact generated a shock like a powerful
[02:42:03] jolt of electricity that went through my entire body. Damn, how could I be hit? After all this,
[02:42:09] how could I get hit? I saw the burp gun trigger burst at me. The snout of his weapon flashed
[02:42:16] and I could not lift my feet above my knee above the knee deep snow to get out of the path of his bullets.
[02:42:23] Two slugs tore into my right arm. Two more of the electric jolt's and my car being flung
[02:42:28] itself away from my grasp. I saw it rising to the air as I fell into the snow. This cannot be happening.
[02:42:37] I tried to raise my head and reach to retrieve my car being get the bastards. My arms wouldn't move.
[02:42:45] I could not raise myself. Joe's down, someone shouted. Bill Fox voice, get the bastards. I heard
[02:42:53] myself yelling, get the bastards. I screamed in pain and overwhelming anger and my Marines rushed
[02:42:59] past me and up the hill leaving Lupa, Cheyenne and me in the snow. Get the bastards. I yelled again
[02:43:06] and again. It was all I can think to do. The young corpsmen who had been assigned to us for the
[02:43:16] days battle cry for the days battle heard my screams. Although the enemy fire still flayed the hill,
[02:43:23] he ran clumsily through the snow to reach my side. I was flat on my back and he crouch beside me.
[02:43:28] Okay Lieutenant, he gasped for air with the exertion of the run laden with his
[02:43:33] aid kit and cold weather gear. His breath made puffs of white steam. Then his smooth,
[02:43:39] shaving face was red with 25 below zero cold. With bullets zinging all around of the new
[02:43:46] corner caught away my parka. The bullet through the shoulder had nicked my lung and blood was
[02:43:51] gushed and blood gushed from my mouth and down the front of my parka covering his bare hands.
[02:43:57] Give me some more feet. I told the kid the pain was terrible. I can't sir. I'm sorry.
[02:44:03] He shook with the cold and with his own fear. Bullet stung the air and raised little
[02:44:11] fountains of snow a few feet away. Give me some goddamn morphine. I yelled spraying my blood on him.
[02:44:18] Sir, the morphine is frozen. I can't give it to you. What the hell is wrong with you?
[02:44:23] Here are the goddamn stuff in your mouth. Don't you boots no? Yes sir. I'm sorry sir.
[02:44:29] He put the serret in his mouth and continued to cut away at my clothing. Just just trying to be still
[02:44:34] sir. Even with the pain and the rage I realized that no one had told the new doc how to take
[02:44:40] care of casualties in below zero weather. I greeted my teeth and tried to shut up.
[02:44:49] I didn't feel the jab when he shoved the serret into my flesh but I soon felt the wave of
[02:44:55] warmth come over me. The pain flowed away and the noise of the fighting above us receded.
[02:45:02] You're a good lad. I told the corpsman. I felt his hands doing something. You'll be a good
[02:45:07] marine. Yes sir. He sounded far away. Before I drift it off, I remembered the photos in my helmet.
[02:45:16] Those are the photos of his wife and his two kids. My pictures I said. That's my wife and kids.
[02:45:22] Don't let the gooks get them. I won't sir. I said the corpsman who had wrist his life to save
[02:45:29] mine and whose name I never knew. Would he tailor was the only officer left with the company?
[02:45:40] He led the troops to the crest of the hill fighting as a rifleman himself.
[02:45:45] The Chinese were on the run and battalion ordered bacon one seven to keep after them.
[02:45:53] The troops were frozen and exhausted but would he push them on.
[02:45:59] Later in the day they reached their objective. With their small number they said a type
[02:46:04] perimeter on the high ground overlooking the gap in the road that the engineers would bridge the next day.
[02:46:11] They get that target secure. They get that hill top and now they're overlooking the gap
[02:46:20] where the engineers are going to build that bridge and they set into a security perimeter.
[02:46:28] Woody Taylor put the weary company on 50% watch against the enemy assault. He knew would come in the
[02:46:34] dark. It was the coldest night that the man had yet endured. A reported 30 degrees below zero.
[02:46:43] The wind howled at them in every direction. All through the unbearably cold hours until
[02:46:48] dawn Taylor and Sergeant Richard moved from man to man to assure that no one froze to death.
[02:46:56] A detail of Korean soldiers who had been attached to the army arrived to bolster the perimeter
[02:47:01] but most of them filtered away during the night. Several times Marines heard the enemy moving
[02:47:08] around their lines in the darkness but no attack came. Woody put out patrols early in the morning
[02:47:16] before light. Within a hundred yards of a line they found frozen dozens of frozen
[02:47:24] Chinese soldiers whose feet and hands were frozen to ice. The extreme cold had been on our side
[02:47:34] holding back the attack.
[02:47:40] And the next day Woody Taylor brought the remnants of the company down from the hills.
[02:47:45] Marched them across the bridge and into the shelter of the town of Chin Hong Ni.
[02:47:56] Their battle ended there.
[02:47:58] Sergeant Richard took a roll call. His final count was 27 men.
[02:48:11] 27 men. And that is that's out of the original 200 plus men of the company.
[02:48:32] And then on top of that another hundred replacements that filled their ranks in this battle.
[02:48:41] So that's 300 men and only 27 remained. 27.
[02:48:50] Now, few of us will ever face those kind of odds. In few of us are ever going to face those
[02:49:14] hellish demands. Few of us will ever stare at hell like these men did.
[02:49:35] But I want you to think about something I want you to imagine.
[02:49:40] Imagine what we can accomplish. If we apply even a fraction of the will that these men displayed,
[02:49:54] the iron will. A will that is stronger than their bodies, a will that is stronger than their minds.
[02:50:07] Because clearly, let's face it. Their bodies, their bodies were broken and their minds in many cases were broken.
[02:50:23] And they didn't want to go on, but their will, their will prevailed.
[02:50:35] Will will will conquer us all. And our will is delivered through discipline.
[02:50:55] And as Joe Owen stated many times in the book, sometimes the only thing that pressed them on was
[02:51:06] discipline. The discipline to push yourself. And you know, we are all capable of more eye
[02:51:27] and capable of more you are capable of more. You can overcome the obstacles and the challenges and the
[02:51:37] enemy and you can overcome your own weaknesses. And you can overcome your own desire to quit.
[02:51:47] Let's, let's, let these men be our examples of how to fight
[02:52:05] and how to use your will and how to drive on and let these men be our examples of how to live.
[02:52:17] And don't. Don't let these men down. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
[02:52:44] Right, echo. If you want to give me a second here to recover and talk about some stuff over there,
[02:52:55] I'd be much obliged.
[02:53:04] Could be one of the rougher of transitions.
[02:53:06] Yeah, you know, it's, you gotta remind yourself, this is a book. This happened. This happened.
[02:53:23] And the fact that these guys couldn't do this and fight on if that doesn't give you
[02:53:29] the inspiration that you need to step past whatever pathetic little challenges in front of you,
[02:53:37] you're wrong. Don't listen to this podcast anymore. Go somewhere else.
[02:53:45] Yeah, it's easy to forget it because of the kind of the contrast of your, like your problem or
[02:53:54] or whatever you want to call it, you're challenged your task, your issue that you're trying to overcome.
[02:53:59] And then contrast with basically the luxury that you live in and that luxury is kind of
[02:54:06] put on you this kind of way of feeling on a habitual level. So, now you're faced with this task,
[02:54:15] comparatively, a big one habitual comfort. Yeah, what we experience. Yes, habitual comfort. Exactly.
[02:54:21] There is one thing. It's cool. I woke up early in the morning. Yeah.
[02:54:26] You know what I mean? Hey, I worked out real hard and sweated a lot. Like, okay. Really? Is that all I got?
[02:54:32] I need to step it up. Yeah, I need to step it up. Yeah. And then, you know, I woke up early in the morning
[02:54:37] or, you know, I didn't get that much sleep. So my day is hard. Cool. Yeah, your foot's not freezing
[02:54:45] off of your body. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And what's a, what's in crowbob? This is
[02:54:50] every single time you go damn, you know? I'm glad they made it out of that. Didn't make it out.
[02:54:55] I mean, they're still just surrounded. Yeah. Yeah. And what's interesting is when you do remind
[02:55:04] yourself of this kind of stuff. Like, like right now, if you know when feels the way I do,
[02:55:09] I feel like, oh, I feel pretty much rejuvenated when I kind of flash back to my life for a second.
[02:55:15] Oh, man. Oh, God. This goes. Yeah. I can go, you know, if I got to work out, I'm going to
[02:55:20] crush that workout because I got all my limbs right now. They didn't freeze off all this stuff.
[02:55:25] So the point there is when you are reminded of real adversity, whether you remind yourself
[02:55:33] or the book or something you see or hear about, um, like, it gives you that, like that added
[02:55:39] will to to overcome. Yeah. Maybe you, you actually can take some of their will. You can learn it.
[02:55:47] Yeah. You can learn it. You can say, oh, you know what, oh, I'm cold right now. You're not cold.
[02:55:51] Yeah. You're, you're, you're, you are not cold. You're tired right now. No, you are not tired.
[02:55:57] You're not. You're afraid right now. No. You are not afraid.
[02:56:01] Learn. Yeah. Learn. You just increase your will through knowledge. It's a real thing.
[02:56:07] Yeah. It's true. And when you do with my point being when you do remind yourself of this kind of
[02:56:13] stuff, man, it helps. It'll help you do whatever it is or over come the fact. Yeah, because you realize
[02:56:20] that that human beings are capable of more. Wait, what you, then what you know, more than I know.
[02:56:27] I'm capable of more than what I've done. I'm going to do more. You know, I'm going to get after
[02:56:32] it. Hargur. That's what I take away from this, these kind of books. Obviously, besides there's
[02:56:37] incredible tactical lessons in there. There's incredible leadership. There's incredible, but the, the
[02:56:43] testament of human will is incredible is unbelievable. Unbelievable testament to human will.
[02:56:49] Yeah. So now I feel like, or it seems like, you know, that when we're faced or when I'm faced with,
[02:56:57] like, oh, this is too hard or dang, I got all this ahead of me. I got to do all, really all
[02:57:03] that is. Now, looking at it, it seems like all it is is a deviation from my habitual comfort.
[02:57:11] Yeah. That's all that is. And I'll tell you what was awesome the way that he reinforced
[02:57:15] it reinforced several times because people talked about fear. I've talked about fear on this podcast
[02:57:18] before, but you know, I kind of say, hey, take action if you're afraid, you got to step into it.
[02:57:22] He said that over and over again. He actually had a methodology. Okay, if I'm afraid, I'm going to
[02:57:26] I'm going to, I'm going to stand up. I'm going to get a rectum. I'm going to find out what's
[02:57:30] going on and I'm going to get, I'm going to find out, I'm going to assess the situation before my
[02:57:36] boss calls me. That's my timeline that I'm working on. Yeah. And that's the same to take action.
[02:57:42] So many, so many great lessons learned in there. Yeah. Well, yeah, I feel like, yeah, we can transition
[02:57:49] over to ways to support. Well, yeah, if you want people with people do want to support the podcast
[02:57:54] out there, I guess you could, if you're in the mood, how to do that? Oh, yeah. So the first way and this is
[02:58:00] kind of a two-way street, you know, okay, on its supplements, right? Supplements, all kinds of cool
[02:58:07] stuff. In fact, my friend from Kuwait, Cameron, he hit me up and was like, hey, what's on it has this,
[02:58:15] it's a new pre-workout, you know, but it's non-stimulate, usually pre-workout. It's like, crush
[02:58:21] a popo-punch, a fedger, and they feed it to you. They don't actually do that, but it seems like they do.
[02:58:27] I'm not saying that's all the bad thing, but it's not like healthy, you know? So anyway, this one is like
[02:58:30] a healthy one is like non-stimulate and it's like, oh, I got it. I just got it. I'm going to try it yet.
[02:58:36] I'm going to get that out. I'm going to get that out. Yeah. But if you're into like, you know,
[02:58:42] sometimes you go on the website and you get like caught up reading all the cool stuff and all the
[02:58:46] stuff like this. It's on there so you can look at it. You know, you mentioned that a lot.
[02:58:49] You actually mentioned that a lot. How you go to the on it website. You know, I maybe I just don't
[02:58:55] do as thorough research as you when it comes to checking out where my acrylic oil comes from,
[02:59:00] but I know what I'm looking for and I go do it. But if you're more like echo and you want to spend
[02:59:05] time on the website reading and researching, it's good place to do is on it.com for a slash
[02:59:10] jockel on there if you want to get a little bunny saved. Yeah, if you want to send save 10% 10% off
[02:59:15] slash jockel. So it's on it dot com slash jockel. Anyway, they got some good stuff. You can

[02:59:25] of Fedra crushed in to powder form. You know, and they're selling it as a, I don't know, it's
[02:59:31] crores. Vazodilator or something like this. It's not that big or a echo. I read no. So anyway,
[02:59:38] yeah, 10% off on it's on it dot com slash jockel. The shrimp tech is dope to alpha brain. These are all
[02:59:44] part of the what do you call EDC. Every day carry every day. Every day consumption. Every day

[03:00:06] they get every day. Yeah. Some people they show them tech every day. Yeah. I take from tech when needed.
[03:00:11] Yeah. When anticipated needed. Yeah. Crill oil every day. Crill oil every day. For sure. Without
[03:00:16] question. Strong bone every day. Yeah. I got this peanut butter or your bar. When needed. Well,
[03:00:23] yeah, when I've been having one every day for the past like three, four days. Yeah, because it's so
[03:00:29] easy. Yeah. Oh, I want to eat something healthy and that tastes good. And I'm kind of hungry. And I want to get
[03:00:34] it really quickly without having to do anything but peel open a wrapper bone more rebars in the house.
[03:00:38] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guaranteed. But yeah, this is cool stuff. I got this peanut butter. It's
[03:00:44] not peanut butter's cashew almond and I don't know something else. It's really good. I've got
[03:00:50] it's real corn may too. MCT oil. It's all up in there. Anyway, good stuff. I don't know. I do have an
[03:00:56] MCT oil too by the way. Yeah. I take the coconut MCT oil from on it and I mix it with heavy whipping
[03:01:03] cream. I don't know. I don't do that until it's whipped cream. Right. I just poured in a little bit
[03:01:08] in there. I stirred up and I drink heavy whipping cream, which is just all fat, which is awesome with
[03:01:14] MCT, which is more fat than I drink all that. Yeah. And it's good fat. Yeah, it's good fat. But it also
[03:01:21] it's very, very fulfilling. Very, very nice. And I'm talking, I almost, it's a little bit
[03:01:27] big when I have little glasses that I mix it in. They're bigger than a shot glass, but they're
[03:01:32] smaller than a cocktail glass. Right. It's called the Rocks Glass. Mm, perhaps. In the bar
[03:01:37] in the shoe. It's okay. You know more about that stuff. Yeah. It's bigger than yeah. Yeah. MCT,
[03:01:43] I mean, not to go into all the fats and good fats for us, but it's more fulfilling fat has nine
[03:01:48] calories per gram. Yeah. Carbide rates and protein. Have four, four. Yeah. Alcohol. 7.
[03:01:56] That was a good idea. I was not aware of that. Yeah. It's all good. Alcohol is not. I don't think
[03:02:01] they saw alcohol on it. So if you're all good there. But that's a good way. I feel like I'm repeating
[03:02:06] it on it.com slash jacco. But if you do want the 10% off, you've got to add the slash jacco.
[03:02:10] If you want to put pay the full price, which is cool too, by the way. Just go on it.com.

[03:03:18] long time, but there's so much stuff that I absolutely had to skip and say, you know, I was
[03:03:24] struggling with myself going, I used up most of a highlighter and a half highlighting this book.

[03:05:59] I totally know this story. Yeah. So yeah, he's one of the, one of the cadets. Yeah, I could edit at
[03:06:07] West Point. Yeah. So he's, I don't know how, do you know how he's all? How we saw him or whatever,
[03:06:14] but a cadet at West Point and I don't have, I don't have his name right now. In uniform. Yeah,
[03:06:19] yeah, he's in uniform, but the uniform that they were, it's cold up there. So where these basically
[03:06:22] it's like a giant cape. And underneath the cape, he had a jocopock ashtirt on. He had actually,
[03:06:30] they actually had the straight-up jockel face on that thing. And it was, he posted an awesome picture
[03:06:35] on social media of him, of him pulling up his cape and he had that, that, that t-shirt on. Yeah.
[03:06:42] Jockel's face. Maybe that was the secret weapon that led the army to the first victory,
[03:06:47] in 14 years over Navy and football. Tom Neill. Tom Neill, yes. He's the, he was the cadet.
[03:06:53] Doing it. Yeah. He was the, in the wild. Really in the wild, double in the wild. Yeah. Well,
[03:06:58] that's he gave me all in the wild. That's, I mean, I don't know what the regulations are,
[03:07:02] but I'm fairly certain that the, the, the t-shirt, the jocopock has t-shirt is not part of our
[03:07:07] army regulations unless it is now. Who know, I'm just saying there were no perhaps. But yeah,
[03:07:11] he's been, he's been actually in touch before he went to West Point. He was, when he was getting ready
[03:07:19] to go, he was like reaching out and he was getting after it. Yeah. Go crush it.
[03:07:24] Don't spoil it. So good. Yeah. Into some nogie, jujutsu. Yeah. True. True. True.
[03:07:29] Anyway, yeah. So jockels stored calm. That's where you can get like cool shirts,
[03:07:33] disciplining cool freedom, you know, all these things, you know, some women stuff on there,
[03:07:37] some hoodies on there, some rash guards on there for, for, yeah, some activity. You know what I'm talking about?
[03:07:43] And some patches on there, the re-regulation one with the, you know, the, I want the, the velcro that's
[03:07:50] some, that's on there, some other stuff. So yeah, go on there, look at it. You don't have to buy nothing.
[03:07:54] Just look at it. If you like something, go ahead. Get it. Good way to support and boom, you got to
[03:07:59] sure. Um, also, okay. So here's the, here's the thing, let's start a while ago. Okay. So I'll tell
[03:08:09] this story. I'll keep it true. But so I was like, I don't have echo went rogue again. That's it. Yeah.
[03:08:17] So, and it started with kind of nothing. So, you know, okay, we're talking about luxury and like,
[03:08:22] okay, I, I only got six hours sleep. I'm usually used to eight and a half or something like that,
[03:08:28] right. So, but I know I can do a workout. And I know you don't get that much sleep or if you're
[03:08:33] tired and not tired of what you still push through the workout. So, but I'm thinking, yeah, yeah,
[03:08:36] you're hard, your money, whatever, but you got it. There has to be times where you got to
[03:08:41] basically talk yourself into it. Basically. So I'm like, all right, like, what do you say? You
[03:08:49] got it, you know, be honest, like, what do you say? You know, to yourself. And I figured it, it would
[03:08:55] have, you know, like a lot of stuff that you cannot, we say, like, you know, we have this luxury and
[03:09:00] all this stuff. I'm like, all right, but let me, so I asked you and what you told me, I was like, okay,
[03:09:08] that, oh, that was good. So, it was legit right there. So, and it worked. It totally worked.
[03:09:16] So, what I did, you know, one thing like to another kind of in my head. So, I was like, all right,
[03:09:21] you know, what we're gonna do, we're gonna record that. You're gonna say that, I'm gonna record it.
[03:09:25] And on top of that, not just the work, you know, and usually, like, with food and stuff, like,
[03:09:30] donuts and I joke around that, I eat, like, whole things of Oreos, because I kind of, that's just a joke.
[03:09:35] Like, sometimes I do, but you do. Yeah, but I have will-pile. Like, that's not a problem with, but
[03:09:42] some people don't, some like, yeah, that workout thing that you just said could apply to, like,
[03:09:49] all these other things. We're gonna record that, too.
[03:09:51] Then you start thinking, you know, a lot of people have been saying, hey, what about, like,
[03:09:56] a ringtone, you should have ringtones, you know, for my alarm and all this stuff. So, like, all right,
[03:10:01] well, basically, one thing led to another, we recorded them, and I put them on iTunes.
[03:10:08] Called it psychological warfare. It's good move, I think, on my part.
[03:10:14] It's on iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. It's like, yeah, so we're charging, and here's the night,
[03:10:19] so this kind of ties it back to how you can support the podcast. Look, so we hit about eight to
[03:10:24] ten birds with one stone with this. It's nine nine cents for a track, or you can buy, like,
[03:10:29] the whole thing, there's, like, 13, 14 tracks on there for nine bucks. I think that's kind of standard,
[03:10:33] but so that's so much, I put it, or I listed it as, and you just download it, you put it as your ringtone.
[03:10:40] There's one for a waking up. Actually, there's two for a waking up, right? So, you can put three for waking up.
[03:10:44] Maybe, yeah, but there's a few. Because in my mind, I pictured people, like, oh, you want to wake up?
[03:10:50] Cool, we can come on that. I go through that every day waking up. Well, so yeah, we'll do that.
[03:10:55] It's sort of like a song that you could buy, it's like a song that you could buy on iTunes.
[03:11:00] Yeah, same process. Or an album. Yeah, same process. You just, yeah, you just download. You can buy one
[03:11:05] track two tracks, or the whole thing, or what, you know, it's 99 cents. So it's not like,
[03:11:10] you're supporting the podcast. Yeah, exactly right. Here's here's a little tip. I was thinking about
[03:11:14] though. So you know, you're wake up. There's like, oh, a few wake up ones, right? I mentioned that.
[03:11:21] If you put that as your alarm, clear it with your wife or whoever you're sleeping with. I'll tell you
[03:11:27] right now if that thing, but if she don't know about it, and that comes on, it'll freak her out then.
[03:11:32] So, do that. That's a little pro tip right there if he's in it. But I will, I will say it's 100%
[03:11:40] guaranteed. If you felt like, how I felt with workouts, like, I'm really not in the mood to go
[03:11:44] do a workout. And you listen to the workout one, I will say with 100% certainty, you will not skip the
[03:11:51] work. I'll say that right now. That's legit. Anyway, psychological warfare. Who's the artist?
[03:11:59] I think it's just a willink. Okay. I think, because that's how they list them by artist, right?
[03:12:04] Yeah, I think so. That I just, that I just become an artist with there. That's scary. Let's call it something
[03:12:09] else. You kind of got to do something else. You kind of have to find this and push into it though.
[03:12:14] So, you know, artist author, podcaster, technically. Is that the thing? You have to,
[03:12:21] you know what, give your wife the heads up if you're a fighter. These guys are flaked in the
[03:12:24] worn career, I'm over here being an artist. What happened? But it's all you know wrong. Not going to
[03:12:30] happen. Not, it's all for because though, I'm telling you because if anyone's like, I am which
[03:12:36] I'm straight up. It's more than assumption. I'm, I am of the belief that some people are like me
[03:12:41] in that way where you just don't feel like it. I know we just read this and now we all feel like
[03:12:47] it. I understand that. But you don't have that feeling every single day.
[03:12:51] Then tell me right now, this helps. This helps to get after it. Help me, for sure.
[03:12:56] You know, psychological warfare. You know, all right, also, hey, on iTunes or sorry,
[03:13:03] not on iTunes, but on Amazon, you can get some white tea. It's like I said, we're working through
[03:13:10] the supply chain issues. But it's been popping up every couple days. They refill. You can order it.
[03:13:15] It tastes good and it makes you feel good and it will increase your deadlift capabilities
[03:13:23] to a minimum of 7,000 pounds. Many are getting up to 8,000 pounds. From drinking chocolate,
[03:13:30] you can get up and get after it mug by the way, too. So those are bigger than normal. I'll say that.
[03:13:37] They're bigger than a normal mug. A normal mug is not as big as it get after it mug.
[03:13:42] So it's like with every sip, you're doing bicep curls. You're getting, actually, that's not my joke.
[03:13:49] I could still have from Twitter. So that's that. Also, when Amazon, you can pick up colder than hell.
[03:13:56] The book I read today, do it. Put it in your collection of badass books. You can pick up
[03:14:02] another book that's called Extreme Ownership. That's written by me and my brother, Dave Babin.
[03:14:08] It is also a book that's about combat, but it's also more of a book about leadership.
[03:14:14] And if you want to give some, speaking of the holiday season,
[03:14:20] if you want to give someone a gift, that's going to, you know, some gifts that you get,
[03:14:24] they go in the drawer that doesn't get opened anymore. Right? And then it takes you a couple
[03:14:30] years and you finally throw it away. Don't give that gift. Give the gift that someone's going to say,
[03:14:37] give me that book. It's legit. I read it. Oh, I implemented this. Hey, what did you think about the
[03:14:42] gift? Give my gift that's going to have long-term value, long-term value. Give them a little book called
[03:14:48] Extreme Ownership. You can know Amazon.com. Hey, speaking of extreme ownership. Also, we got the
[03:14:55] master number two, 002 May 4th and 5th at the Marriott Markey in New York City. Now, the last one
[03:15:02] that we had, we had people from 42 different states. We had people from five foreign countries.
[03:15:09] And we had leaders at every level of the chain of command in every size business that you could
[03:15:16] imagine. So it was a super diverse group of people that are all together with, they had one similarity
[03:15:23] and that is they want to get better and crush it in leadership in their business and in their life.
[03:15:30] So that's what we do with the master, life and I who are there. Obviously, when I say we're there,
[03:15:38] I don't mean we're there, meaning we're in the same building, but we're hiding somewhere.
[03:15:41] No, no, we're there. We are actually with you. We are sitting down with you. We are talking. We are
[03:15:47] we're not hiding behind the curtain. We don't even have a backstage. They said, well,
[03:15:51] where do you want your backstage? We don't need one. We're not going backstage. People want to come
[03:15:57] and talk and learn. We want to learn from them. So come and get it. I've said this every time.
[03:16:02] This is going to sell out. It's going to sell out and then you won't be able to go. And also,
[03:16:06] the prices are going up. So as you get closer to the event, the prices go up. The reason we do that
[03:16:14] is so we incentivize you to buy the tickets now so that we can plan better. We like to be
[03:16:19] planned, we plan and we prepare things. If all of you sign up, April 22nd, we got some logistics
[03:16:29] problems. I don't want to be in the same boat. I'm in with Jockel White Tea, where I've failed
[03:16:32] logistically. And it takes me a while to get it back on track. So sign up early, save yourself some
[03:16:39] money and let us be better prepared for that. If you got questions, you can email,
[03:16:43] muster at echelonfront.com or you can check out the website www.extremownership.com.
[03:16:54] We will see you there and you will see me. You'll see, Lave, you'll see Echo Charles.
[03:17:00] And you'll see everybody else. We'll all be there getting after it. While you're waiting
[03:17:08] to hang out with us at the muster, if you want to hang out with us virtually,
[03:17:14] well Echo and I are both kind of cruising the interwebs. Twitter, yep, where they're
[03:17:23] Instagram, where they're and you even gonna see us. You're even gonna see us on that Facebook
[03:17:32] you boy. Echo is at echelonchiles and I am at Jockel Willink. And finally, we appreciate
[03:17:46] you listening and supporting the podcast and of course spread in the word. But don't just listen.
[03:17:56] Do. Execute. Take a look at your life and see where you can apply the kind of human
[03:18:08] will we heard about tonight. The kind of human will that overcomes challenges and obstacles,
[03:18:18] whether you're fighting a war or you're fighting a fire or you're fighting crime or you're building
[03:18:25] a bridge or you're building a piece of software or whether you're doing HVAC work or retail work
[03:18:35] or whether you're healing kids or you're teaching kids. No matter what you are doing,
[03:18:47] what can you do to do it better? What can you do to make you better?
[03:18:55] Ask yourself that question. Apply that will and get after it.
[03:19:12] So until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.
[03:19:17] Out.
