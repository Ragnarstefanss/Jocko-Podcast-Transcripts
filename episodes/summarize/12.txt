I don't even remember there were so many of them that we do and Greg Jackson would bring guys out to to fight to compete and so like we wrestled against these guys you know or we did some fishing grappling and these guys so I kind of knew him from that and then surprisingly one time when the UFC was in San Diego I was at work at the seal teams and someone called and said hey there's a there's a guy from the UFC here do you want to give them a tour of you know he wants a tour the UFC set up a tour of the seal teams they want to show them around like the facility there is facilities you know the whatever some guns you know just the gear so when it doesn't make sense logical sense to go on that's when you got to use your emotion that's when you got to use that anger and frustration that fear to push yourself harder to push yourself to say I don't stop and when your feelings are screaming that you've had enough and when you think you're going to break emotionally you got to override that emotion with the concrete logic and will power that says you know what I don't stop so you fight the weak emotions with the power of logic and you fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotions and in the balance of those two that's where you find the strength and the tenacity and the guts to say yourself I don't stop and you won't and I think that's about it for tonight so thanks to everyone for tuning in and listening to us if you want to continue these conversations you want to join in these conversations you connect with us through the interwebs on Twitter I'm at Jocca Willink and of course echo Charles is at echo Charles thanks for leaving reviews of the podcast on iTunes and of the book on Amazon and most of all everyone that's out there tuning in listening you got your head set on you're getting in the zone thank you for getting after it and so until next time this is Jocco and echo out and those would you do you think I mean total gas but do you think that's because those just happen to be the exceptions or is it because really the formula kind of seems like here's the emotion and then here's all the logic and the skill and the planning implementation of you know game plans and all the all the stuff that you're gonna use in your mind and here's the emotion it's like it's like it's like a little spark plug or something that's what it sounds like no I did that don't perfectly try to do it if I were to go out of my way to leave out that number true you know you wanted to know you wanted to know how much I was doing I knew you were going to say it didn't matter for now you wanted to help anyway doesn't matter nonetheless the first time I failed and I was like but I felt that anger and power playing takes technique that's the thing it's not like it's just you know like I don't know like a even bench has some technique but that left is I mean everything has technique but power clean takes a little bit more technique than other left and I'm watching the fight and Greg Jackson is cornering Carlos content now if you don't know anything about Greg Jackson he's he's pretty zen like a guy and I'm actually going back in the day going way back in the day when Dean and I were competing all the time in the kind of the so-called scene of grappling we would we do every competition there was we're competing all the time grappling And he's like, hey, it's slow, you know, the cat is a big, you know, Bobcat, you know, the Bobcat is not sure. and it's the same thing with Carlos Carlos was absolutely gonna lose that fight if he didn't do something different if he didn't you know it's like it's like hit in the turbo button it's like hitting uh when I hit your socks And as a matter of fact, I actually had a mutiny in, in one of my potuence, where this is a long time ago, it's, you know, all the names are long since forgotten, but we had a, we had a mutiny in our potuence, where we said, you know, pretty much us, us lower and listed guys, we had a, we went to the, we literally went to the commanding officer, and said, we don't work with this guy. but with but with anger you know it can make you go for another you know whatever maybe it's maybe it's two minutes and this is something else have you ever missed like a heavy single like You know how people will like, I don't know, something just as small as like name dropping. right you know well he's been abusing her for 10 years already you know or in your case 27 years or you know whatever the number is And, you know, I wanted to have him on as a, you know, as a, as a, as a, I don't know what the word I'm looking for is, but I wanted to have guy from his platoon on or from there, platoon on to talk about him. you know there's a great time where you like you know what I'm not gonna let my emotions play into this I heard a heard something about tiger woods and his golf game So, you know, all these ideas that people have of the, you know, military and of, you know, we obey orders and all this stuff. and I think these times you know like I talked about Jeremy you know I had to provoke some anger out of him Mary's not spending the way they train up there at try stories I spent like the week and I was like half a week or whatever with them with for us and um and Rory and it's heat for us as this head you know how guys hold mitts I'm sure they hold mitts and stuff He's like, it doesn't, it can carry a ton of, you know, it was like you, you're like the cat. but so Carlos Condit versus Rory McDonald and Carlos who's the veteran is going up the kids the kid you know Rory McDonald was in kind of an A was an unknown but he was definitely the younger I think he was 20 years old you know just a kid no offense Rory right I mean what we just said I mean we've seen it we know we know for a fact but rules are made to be broken um there are times win emotion can increase performance right they're absolutely are and a zen like guy if you watch him in the corners of his fights he's always like that just very steady and hey this is what you need to do you need to watch out for this or whatever hmm so I'm watching this fight and like I said Carlos Condit versus Rurric Donald Carlos is not winning right but I just snake some really good seats so I had a really good view by the way when I go to UFC thanks day to white and the rest of the crew like I sneak into some awesome seats after I get done cornering people so thank you so I was sitting you know in the second row or something phenomenal seat that I'd snuck into and because they throw you in the cheap seats when you're when you're cornering people you come out to watch the fights
