00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.84 This is Jockel Podcast number 257 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:12.72 The president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver star to
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:18.72 Sergeant First Class Ryan Michael Hendrixon, United States Army for exceptional gallantry in the face of
00:00:18.72 --> 00:00:26.80 the enemies of the United States of America with exceptional valerous conduct as the engineer sergeant
00:00:26.80 --> 00:00:35.84 of special operational detachment, Bravo, SF-ODB-7220 advanced operations based north
00:00:35.84 --> 00:00:43.84 special operations task force afghanistan on 23 February 2016 during operation freedoms
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:52.56 Sentinel in support of resolute support mission 4. On 23 February 2016 members of the fifth
00:00:52.56 --> 00:01:07.36 eighth and tenth special operations conduct actively advised by SF-ODB-7220 conducted clearing
00:01:07.36 --> 00:01:15.12 operations in order to deny a known Taliban safe haven. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon
00:01:15.12 --> 00:01:23.36 led a team of national mine reduction group and MRG soldiers ahead of the main effort to clear
00:01:23.36 --> 00:01:30.32 routes of improvised explosive devices, IEDs clearing 15 IEDs in the process.
00:01:32.56 --> 00:01:35.68 While conducting movement to the first compound of interest,
00:01:35.68 --> 00:01:41.68 a member of this element struck a tripwire IED. The element immediately took cover.
00:01:41.68 --> 00:01:47.84 However, there was no detonation. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's team was then immediately ambushed
00:01:47.84 --> 00:01:55.52 by heavy enemy machine gun, small arms and RPG fire from approximately 15 meters away.
00:01:57.12 --> 00:02:03.12 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon immediately directed his NMRG team to place
00:02:03.12 --> 00:02:07.52 suppressive fires on the enemy while providing detailed terminal attack guidance,
00:02:07.52 --> 00:02:15.12 which enabled an F-16 closer support platform to conduct a strike on fortified enemy fighting
00:02:15.12 --> 00:02:21.12 positions danger close to his position. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon assessed that his
00:02:21.12 --> 00:02:28.40 element needed to maneuver away from the enemy's position to ensure the safety of his NMRG members.
00:02:29.92 --> 00:02:34.64 He quickly led the element to bound back to a friendly position by creating additional distance
00:02:34.64 --> 00:02:40.48 between his team and the enemy air assets were able to successfully neutralize the enemy
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:47.36 during a second air strike. After the smoke cleared following air to ground engagements,
00:02:47.36 --> 00:02:52.64 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon immediately began clearing a path for friendly forces
00:02:52.64 --> 00:02:59.84 by leading his team to clear several complex IEDs designed to target friendly dismounted elements.
00:02:59.84 --> 00:03:09.36 During exfiltration, the element was re-engaged by heavy and effective enemy pkm rpg sniper
00:03:09.36 --> 00:03:14.64 and mortar fire, which resulted in multiple us and partner force casualties.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.12 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon directed afghan commandos who were pinned down and separated
00:03:21.12 --> 00:03:25.92 from the main element to maneuver to and gain cover behind his position.
00:03:25.92 --> 00:03:33.36 Under heavy enemy fire, Sergeant First Class Hendrixon directed friendly elements to a nearby
00:03:33.36 --> 00:03:41.12 compound where the casualty collection point CCP was established. After conducting headcount,
00:03:41.12 --> 00:03:46.48 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon realized that two partner force members were missing.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon organized a team to locate and recover the separated and potentially
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.60 wounded friendly forces. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon had to be held back numerous times while
00:03:59.60 --> 00:04:06.16 air support conducted additional attacks on enemy positions. Once the air to ground engagements
00:04:06.16 --> 00:04:12.40 were complete, Sergeant First Class Hendrixon selflessly maneuvered the recovery team under
00:04:12.40 --> 00:04:20.000 enemy small arms fire to retrieve the missing friendlies. Upon reaching the two missing soldiers,
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.16 they discovered that the soldiers had been mortally wounded. Sergeant First Class Hendrixon
00:04:26.16 --> 00:04:32.32 then utilized a ladder as a litter to help carry the wounded soldiers to the CCP while his
00:04:32.32 --> 00:04:36.16 element continued to engage enemy forces with suppressive fires.
00:04:38.32 --> 00:04:44.88 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's actions prevented the Taliban forces from recovering the bodies
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:52.72 of friendly forces which ensured all partner force members were accounted for, leaving no one behind.
00:04:55.28 --> 00:05:00.80 Sergeant First Class Hendrixon's actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military
00:05:00.80 --> 00:05:08.000 heroism and reflect distinct credit upon himself. The Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan,
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.12 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Special Operation Component Command,
00:05:13.12 --> 00:05:21.28 Afghanistan Special Operations Joint Task Force, Afghanistan, and the United States Army.
00:05:26.24 --> 00:05:34.56 So obviously that is a silver star citation from an incredibly hard mission
00:05:34.56 --> 00:05:43.04 and this particular individual, this Special Forces soldier Ryan Hendrixon, he had already been
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.88 through hell just to get on that mission. Luckily for us, he has written a book about his experiences
00:05:52.88 --> 00:05:59.92 which is called Tip of the Spear and is an honor to have him with us here tonight to share
00:05:59.92 --> 00:06:07.68 his story. Ryan, that was a doozy of a mission. Thanks for coming on man. I really appreciate
00:06:07.68 --> 00:06:14.48 you guys having me on here. Yes, that was this awesome. Well it's good to meet you and I will
00:06:14.48 --> 00:06:19.76 dive into that some of the details around that, what you did there because really that's
00:06:20.64 --> 00:06:24.24 you know like I said you already been through a hell of a lot just to be on that mission in the
00:06:24.24 --> 00:06:31.76 first place you've been well we'll get there. But yeah let's start at the beginning and you know
00:06:31.76 --> 00:06:37.68 I read your book and it's called Tip of the Spear, the incredible story of an injured green
00:06:37.68 --> 00:06:45.28 berets returned to battle and I always like to start at the beginning so let's start at the beginning
00:06:45.28 --> 00:06:52.40 let's see what made Ryan Hendrixon. So you start off here in the book I grew up in the unincorporated
00:06:52.40 --> 00:06:59.92 California town of Fall River Mills, Nestle between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mount Ranges in
00:06:59.92 --> 00:07:06.80 Rugged Shastock County and then you and I always have to say this I have to jump around in the book
00:07:06.80 --> 00:07:10.64 I'm not going to read the whole book you have to buy the book if you want to get the whole story
00:07:10.64 --> 00:07:16.56 but I'll fast forward through a bunch of the highlights this is always a good way to start life
00:07:16.56 --> 00:07:22.08 pretty much sucked because my mother who delivered my sister and me into this world was
00:07:22.08 --> 00:07:29.04 hooked on drugs and alcohol. Dad's center packing my dad was a Vietnam vet who did two tours as
00:07:29.04 --> 00:07:35.20 an aviation crew chief before returning to the Pacific Northwest and eventually northern California
00:07:35.20 --> 00:07:40.000 following his honorable discharge from the US Army. During the Vietnam War my dad's primary
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.40 aircraft was the DH3 otter with the 54th aviation out of Vung Tao but he constantly found himself
00:07:48.40 --> 00:07:57.20 flying into combat in a Huey military helicopter formerly known as the Bell UH1. It was in a Huey
00:07:57.20 --> 00:08:04.96 that my father experienced the true horror of war as an M60 door gunner using the deadly firepower
00:08:04.96 --> 00:08:14.56 at his fingertips to rain down death on NVA troops and Vietcom. So your dad was in NAMM. How many years
00:08:14.56 --> 00:08:19.04 did it? Do you like the two years like hey I was in Vietnam I did two years and got out and
00:08:19.04 --> 00:08:24.72 stay in longer what do you do? Well yeah he actually actually did two tours in Vietnam so total
00:08:24.72 --> 00:08:28.80 of four years in the Army but he did a two back to back to back to tours in Vietnam.
00:08:29.60 --> 00:08:36.32 As in two years straight dang. Yeah well there was a there was a break because he came back
00:08:36.32 --> 00:08:42.64 for our nr and then went back so you know kind of little break but yeah he did he did a
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:47.92 two tours over there and what what do you know anything about his decision making process on that?
00:08:49.28 --> 00:08:55.28 His so what we have talked about his decision behind wanting to do multiple tours in Vietnam
00:08:55.28 --> 00:09:02.08 is never wanting to love the people and number two it's it's combat and combat that's a
00:09:02.08 --> 00:09:08.72 dicken extremely dick dangerously a dicken and that was kind of when he was over there he's like
00:09:08.72 --> 00:09:15.44 hey I can go back to whatever northern California or Oregon or I can sit here and just keep
00:09:15.44 --> 00:09:21.28 getting after it. Yep. And the choice was pretty obvious for how old was he? He left out a high
00:09:21.28 --> 00:09:25.76 school he volunteered for the Army at high school which what do you know what year it was?
00:09:25.76 --> 00:09:35.04 1966. Oh dang. I think yeah around in there. But then he got out. So he did two tours two
00:09:35.04 --> 00:09:42.80 years straight with a little break do you know how you got out? I'm not extremely sure the decision
00:09:42.80 --> 00:09:48.48 making process behind him getting out as he told me you know back in those days being in the military
00:09:48.48 --> 00:09:55.92 wasn't like it is today. And so you know getting out and moving on with your life or whatnot like
00:09:55.92 --> 00:10:01.92 that that is just the military wasn't popular at the time. It wasn't a prestigious thing for
00:10:01.92 --> 00:10:09.92 you know like today us serving it's you know it means something and back then it's he's like
00:10:09.92 --> 00:10:16.24 yeah well if you went in in 66 so he did need the two tours in nom so he's the we're talking
00:10:16.24 --> 00:10:25.20 yeah this is 1968 1969. Yep. The wars freakin everyone's against it. You guys moved around a bunch
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:32.88 um redding uh you say this about your dad before Wendy and that's your sister before Wendy and I
00:10:32.88 --> 00:10:38.32 came in the world though my dad was a guy who liked his beer. You get drunk and if you happen
00:10:38.32 --> 00:10:42.88 across pass with him in a wrong way you would most likely be at the losing end of a fist fight
00:10:44.16 --> 00:10:49.28 you worked hard logging putting in crazy 12 hour days but he partied even harder. When the
00:10:49.28 --> 00:10:53.76 logging industry was booming and money was good coming in he was blown a healthy portion of his
00:10:53.76 --> 00:11:01.60 del on booze and you go into some detail here he was just sort of blazing a pass of destruction
00:11:03.68 --> 00:11:13.92 one night he's like drunk and basically feels like his life is kind of going nowhere. Yep.
00:11:13.92 --> 00:11:20.80 And he's well I'll go to the book here. Well driving in his drunk and stoop where my father thought
00:11:20.80 --> 00:11:26.000 about what his life had become. His options had slowly dwindled down over the years with no hope
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.76 and no future he believed he was facing his last choice to end it all. Dad pulled his truck in front
00:11:31.76 --> 00:11:37.84 of uncle Steve's house. Redd is he shifted into park a man appeared in front of the house and walked
00:11:37.84 --> 00:11:43.60 up to the driver's side window. Dad hadn't seen him leave the house so he didn't know how or why
00:11:43.60 --> 00:11:50.16 this man had approached his car. My uncle lived in the middle of nowhere. Larry Hendrickson the middle
00:11:50.16 --> 00:11:55.60 aged man dressed conservatively had a smile on his face. My father never seen this man in his life.
00:11:55.60 --> 00:12:01.84 How do you know my name he asked? The man ignored a question. Larry your out of chances aren't you he
00:12:01.84 --> 00:12:07.04 asked. This time my father was too stunned to answer. It doesn't have to be that way the man
00:12:07.04 --> 00:12:13.92 continued. Jesus has a better plan for you and your life. In front of my uncle's house that night my
00:12:13.92 --> 00:12:20.32 father found God. After that his hellian days slowed to a trickle that didn't mean he didn't get
00:12:20.32 --> 00:12:24.56 pissed off at the cards he was dealt in life especially after he had just polished off another six
00:12:24.56 --> 00:12:28.88 pack but my father like everyone else I've met including myself was on a journey.
00:12:30.24 --> 00:12:34.72 So that sounds like almost a mystical situation like where does dude come from?
00:12:35.60 --> 00:12:40.56 Yeah so talking out or talking it out with my dad and it's one of the most powerful stories
00:12:40.56 --> 00:12:47.92 but yeah he was so he threw the truck into park and he was going to bring my sister and I
00:12:47.92 --> 00:12:53.12 two my uncle's house tell my uncle to take care of us then he was going to go shoot himself in the
00:12:53.12 --> 00:13:00.56 head and that's I don't know I mean you know I am religious and I believe you know I believe that
00:13:01.20 --> 00:13:07.36 God has a plan for everybody and that was just the plan. Did this guy
00:13:07.36 --> 00:13:14.56 did we ever see this guy again? I don't think he had we ever did I I was young so but I don't think my
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:24.40 dad ever did now crazy yeah so you guys move around for a while you say we lived out
00:13:24.40 --> 00:13:28.24 we lived out in the woods in a house that had no running water due to damage pipes and
00:13:28.24 --> 00:13:36.32 limited electricity so the place was cheap your dad got hurt and then he gets rehealed up
00:13:36.32 --> 00:13:41.44 and and you say it was clear that he couldn't even afford a home with running water or steady
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:46.72 electricity his only option was to have us move in with his mother who lived in Colton or again
00:13:47.28 --> 00:13:53.60 won a 100 miles to the south Colton was even smaller than Birk and Field but my grandmother could
00:13:53.60 --> 00:13:57.76 help provide the necessities of life while my father got under his feet and attended a Bible
00:13:57.76 --> 00:14:03.76 college he wanted to become a preacher fast forward a little bit after my father got ordained as a
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:09.76 preacher his first pastor it was at a small church in Lincoln City on the Central Oregon Coast.
00:14:10.96 --> 00:14:15.52 He seemed happy and we as a family were happy although we were still poor didn't
00:14:15.52 --> 00:14:20.64 matter much because life was good my dad didn't my dad being a preacher didn't lift us out of poverty
00:14:20.64 --> 00:14:25.20 actually just the opposite happened we had to live in a tent for several months while we waited to
00:14:25.20 --> 00:14:31.20 move into the upstairs of the parsnige tent living wasn't bad but it did get embarrassing when
00:14:31.20 --> 00:14:37.92 other kids saw our living conditions and teased me at school all right let's get down to brass
00:14:37.92 --> 00:14:46.48 tax how big of a tent was this tent um I would say a last intent afghan alaskan tent and now
00:14:46.48 --> 00:14:51.04 I kind of feel bad about writing that in there because I've definitely lived in a last
00:14:51.04 --> 00:14:57.68 intent with about 15 other dudes and so we actually had it pretty nice um yeah
00:14:57.68 --> 00:15:06.08 right on well that's a positive attitude bad I like it um you continue on here after the
00:15:06.08 --> 00:15:10.32 tiny church in Lincoln City couldn't afford to keep its doors open we were forced to pack up
00:15:10.32 --> 00:15:17.04 and move again this time we settled in the sleepy logging town of low ol Oregon 20 miles southeast
00:15:17.04 --> 00:15:23.52 of Eugene and populated with 1000 residents my dad did his best to keep us in one spot until I
00:15:23.52 --> 00:15:28.16 could finish high school and move on with my life I guess having four years and one place is why
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:35.12 I say that low is my hometown I was always active as a kid preferring to wander around the foot hills
00:15:35.12 --> 00:15:38.80 of the cascade mountains or play sports rather than sitting on my butt watching movies or doing
00:15:38.80 --> 00:15:44.48 nothing I'm sure I was hell for my dad to raise but he instilled in me the idea that I should set
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:51.36 the rules for my life not let life set rules for me at low ol high I gave everything I had to
00:15:51.36 --> 00:15:57.44 our football and wrestling programs I was never the most talented athlete but every coach said I was
00:15:57.44 --> 00:16:03.36 the toughest kid they'd ever trained that was when I first heard the saying that boys to stupid
00:16:03.36 --> 00:16:10.40 to quit a backhanded compliment for sure but I wore it like a badge of honor how good were you
00:16:10.40 --> 00:16:19.36 at wrestling um I was mediocre and so but did you start wrestling in high school or did you wrestle
00:16:19.36 --> 00:16:25.84 before that a third yeah so I was against kids that were wrestling since they were in whatever
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:31.44 first grade kindergarten yeah I was never a rock star at it or anything like that but I picked it
00:16:31.44 --> 00:16:38.48 up quickly and and I just kind of I don't know it was I was wrestling in my mind I know while
00:16:38.48 --> 00:16:45.68 people will have their own opinions about it but it's probably one of the toughest I guess sports
00:16:45.68 --> 00:16:50.72 out there as far as physical fitness endurance and whatnot and that also leads into you know um
00:16:50.72 --> 00:16:56.72 a jujitsu and um Greco Roman and freestyle whatnot but um it also what it did for me was
00:16:57.44 --> 00:17:04.80 it kind of I already had that work ethic but it kind of like I mean you you have to get tough
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:09.36 or are you just gonna get slaughtered on Matt and that's embarrassing because I've had it happened
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:19.44 before what what weight did you wrestle at um so I wrestled I started off at one one twenty whatever
00:17:19.44 --> 00:17:29.28 it was one twenty one yeah and then my senior year um I cut weight down to 142 which um was
00:17:30.08 --> 00:17:35.76 yeah pretty hard but I was running from the 151 weight class because the kid there was just a beast
00:17:35.76 --> 00:17:41.36 and so I got weight down to 142 basically running from somebody and uh went to state and then you
00:17:41.36 --> 00:17:46.48 know did okay. Oh yeah well damn if you went to state in Oregon that's freaking legit. Yeah I was
00:17:46.48 --> 00:17:53.92 during the uh got just period and stuff like that so um we we had a pretty Oregon uh was nationally
00:17:53.92 --> 00:17:58.24 known for wrestling with you know like the gotchish brothers and whatnot but that's awesome man.
00:17:58.24 --> 00:18:06.88 Um here's a little story one day as we were kicking around my future you're talking about your
00:18:06.88 --> 00:18:11.44 dad he told me a story there were two old men sitting on their porch is staring out to the
00:18:11.44 --> 00:18:16.48 abyss they didn't know each other but they had one thing in common they were waiting on death
00:18:17.84 --> 00:18:22.32 I leaned in closer dad could always tell a good story but this was different he meant business
00:18:22.32 --> 00:18:28.88 one old man was miserable he had let life's chances pass him by and now thoughts of opportunities
00:18:28.88 --> 00:18:35.36 long gone were replaced with haunted ideas of what could have been the other old man was totally
00:18:35.36 --> 00:18:40.32 fulfilled by the life he had lived he had done everything there was to do and now he could sit back
00:18:40.32 --> 00:18:46.40 and relish his golden month moments and wonderful memories because he had lived life to the fullest
00:18:46.40 --> 00:18:53.68 so there you go son I wish I would have done this or that statements are a prison of misery for
00:18:53.68 --> 00:18:59.68 the mind you want to go through life and be perfectly content with the life you've lived you want to
00:18:59.68 --> 00:19:05.20 do everything there is to be done right or wrong you do it and never regret a decision you made
00:19:06.96 --> 00:19:12.08 this from a man who'd been off to war fought for his life seen the world given life taken life
00:19:12.08 --> 00:19:17.52 loved and had his heart broken he had made mistakes taken chances and failed and succeeded many times
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:23.60 good or bad I can sit back and reminisce on my life and feel good about it he said when God tells
00:19:23.60 --> 00:19:28.88 me it's my time to go home I will leave this earth fulfilled because I've done it all and I want
00:19:28.88 --> 00:19:36.16 you to feel the same way so let me leave you with this thought what kind of old man do you want to be
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:46.56 son freaking good guidance from the from from pops you know yeah that's that is pretty much
00:19:46.56 --> 00:19:53.20 that guidance right there is pretty much led you know half of the the decisions I've made my life
00:19:53.20 --> 00:19:59.12 whether or not I look back and I'm like wow I can't believe I'm alive from that most of what he said
00:19:59.12 --> 00:20:03.20 right there is the reason why you know I can look back and like wow that was I was really dumb
00:20:03.20 --> 00:20:08.88 let's try this again so and that's sort of what made you guys start talking about you going in the
00:20:08.88 --> 00:20:16.40 military I know you you check with an army recruiter you didn't even you didn't even think about the
00:20:16.40 --> 00:20:26.24 navy no that's the first so the basically out went down was my my teachers basically said hey
00:20:26.24 --> 00:20:32.16 you'll graduate if you join the military you are you are D.U.M. dumb like you need to go do something
00:20:32.16 --> 00:20:36.80 that the military will force you to all right so the air force they looked in my test scores and
00:20:36.80 --> 00:20:44.72 they're like no sorry man you're you're real cute but now the the army they actually didn't in the
00:20:44.72 --> 00:20:50.40 mid 90s they didn't need anybody it was crazy so they had like Patriot missile program and there's like a
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:58.08 six month wait to get in and then the Marines came in and I got so angry and me now's like man you're
00:20:58.08 --> 00:21:03.60 scary I like I don't want to be in the ring you're scaring me and then so the navy recruiter
00:21:04.40 --> 00:21:10.000 I mean he might as well had on like a Hawaiian t-shirt what now but you know you want to you want to
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.04 be an F-14 Tomcat pilot like Tom Cruise like yeah you want to be a navy seal like Charlie Sheans
00:21:17.04 --> 00:21:24.08 yeah you want to go to exotic ports and see exotic women and yeah he goes cool man sign here it's like
00:21:24.08 --> 00:21:34.88 all right I didn't I didn't fly in F-14 as anyone so so then you went to boot camp and look there's
00:21:34.88 --> 00:21:41.04 so much you cover this stuff in the book which is which is cool but I'm gonna jump through jump
00:21:41.04 --> 00:21:46.96 past some of that stuff you go on here you finally get to see being on board a ship with 900 other
00:21:46.96 --> 00:21:50.88 sailors and Marines all male in this deployment was a major culture shock and not for the
00:21:50.88 --> 00:21:56.48 F-14 heart especially for low and listed sailors like me working 16 hour days and doing maintenance
00:21:56.48 --> 00:22:01.44 duties like keeping the deck department and equipment in good condition loading and unloading cargo
00:22:01.44 --> 00:22:07.60 shining brass busting rust because of salt water and painting bulkheads walls and passageways
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:14.32 the same battleship gray sucked what little free time I had was spending my coffin rack
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:18.56 trying to get some much needed sleep tell us about a coffin rack what's at all about
00:22:18.56 --> 00:22:25.28 coffin racks yes so when people talk about quality of life in the military I just say
00:22:25.28 --> 00:22:31.76 if you've never lived on a ship that was commissioned in the 60s then I don't think you really
00:22:31.76 --> 00:22:37.76 understand what bad quality life is so cloth got what was worse the tent that you lived in or
00:22:37.76 --> 00:22:43.60 the ship board oh shit oh my far and the Marines had it even worse oh yeah they were I think they were
00:22:43.60 --> 00:22:49.28 stacked like six high down in the Marine Burthing Bayes or five high yeah well I did two deployments
00:22:49.28 --> 00:22:55.20 on amphib ships yeah both of them were built in like 1960 something like that they were built to
00:22:55.20 --> 00:23:01.44 transport troops over to the southeast Asia yeah and so you were supposed to be on them when they
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:06.48 originally built this was put Marines on there for whatever a four week trip and then you'd get
00:23:06.48 --> 00:23:11.28 off and go do your work well by the time the 90s rolled around like what you're talking about here
00:23:11.28 --> 00:23:16.72 we were going on six six month deployments and and yes I stayed in the as a seal was staying in the
00:23:16.72 --> 00:23:22.88 Burthing where where the Marine stayed and so yeah there would be David we literally had the old
00:23:22.88 --> 00:23:31.28 school canvas racks the canvas strong between metal pipes yeah and then a little cheap freaking
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:37.68 mattress on top of that and yeah it was just and you there before five high I think usually
00:23:37.68 --> 00:23:43.52 we would kind of adjust our our living space as seals we kind of like yeah we'd do some work in there
00:23:43.52 --> 00:23:50.72 so maybe it wouldn't be quite as bad but uh get some golf and rack sorry I cut you off no people yeah
00:23:50.72 --> 00:23:55.44 people don't understand but your your entire life so I've done um I was on you know the USS
00:23:55.44 --> 00:24:02.88 Shreaf port which was LPD 12 amphib boiler super old and then um you know the gloom I did some time
00:24:02.88 --> 00:24:09.04 on that and then the camden well the camden was commissioned in the 70s so it was super it was just
00:24:09.04 --> 00:24:16.40 this great upgrade but yeah the Shreaf port we we were in the Persian Gulf probably 10 months
00:24:16.40 --> 00:24:26.56 in 98 and um and then yeah it's your coffin rack like you have that thin mattress and then
00:24:26.56 --> 00:24:33.76 you open up the what the mattress sits on is basically a lid that you open up and now you have
00:24:34.64 --> 00:24:42.24 your your area your where your clothes go and you know everything else and it's just this tiny like
00:24:42.24 --> 00:24:48.24 it's it's it's coffin but even a coffin has more depth than a coffin rack does on board ship
00:24:48.96 --> 00:24:54.24 and so yeah that's that's here entire life and when you're in subdivision and you're lower
00:24:54.24 --> 00:24:59.52 and listed I mean we were stuck for high and and so it was and then you got you know you have your little
00:24:59.52 --> 00:25:05.92 curtain close the curtain and you know trying to get some sleeper whatnot and maybe
00:25:05.92 --> 00:25:12.72 kick the rack of the guy next to you and he's being too loud so you know you know all about it
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:17.76 yeah no it's uh it's that's what's always surprising is you know when guys are going through
00:25:17.76 --> 00:25:23.12 the training and you know even if you even if you just hear about that you think well I don't that doesn't
00:25:23.12 --> 00:25:28.24 sound like a good deal I might be wet cold and sandy right now but that sounds like maybe I don't
00:25:28.24 --> 00:25:35.04 want to go do that uh this was I thought this was interesting so fast forward a little bit at the
00:25:35.04 --> 00:25:41.04 time the USS Cole was bombed I was on board my second ship the USS Camden we were then 12 hours
00:25:41.04 --> 00:25:46.32 of Yemen when the distress calls came out we sailed full steam ahead through the streets of
00:25:46.32 --> 00:25:52.80 Hormuz at along the USS along with the USS Donald Cook we would be the first American military
00:25:52.80 --> 00:25:58.24 personnel to arrive in assist the Cole crew in saving the ship and pulling bodies from the
00:25:58.24 --> 00:26:02.96 wreckage I'll never forget the smell of burning human flesh when I stepped on board the Cole
00:26:02.96 --> 00:26:08.000 for the next week we teamed up with Cole crew members to keep the ship from sinking and recovered
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.08 the remains of all 17 heroes killed that day I was I had witnessed the first salvo in what would
00:26:14.08 --> 00:26:19.68 become known as the war on terror and our rescue and recovery effort with the USS Cole would
00:26:19.68 --> 00:26:28.16 impact my life in the years to come yeah you you definitely be in on a navy ship you feel
00:26:28.16 --> 00:26:33.60 very untouchable by the enemy for sure and especially in the 90s so that must have been a shocker
00:26:33.60 --> 00:26:39.12 I was a shocker for the world but for you to actually go there that's crazy yeah I've seen that
00:26:39.12 --> 00:26:45.36 I remember when we were on the we call Liberty boats but you know there were the barges taken us
00:26:45.36 --> 00:26:52.40 over to the Cole and just looking at that massive hole in the side of it that had just been
00:26:52.40 --> 00:26:59.12 blown in there about 18 hours prior it was yeah it's pretty intense it's you know you go from
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:05.68 untouchable to all of a sudden you can't be touched and so and yeah it would set the path for
00:27:05.68 --> 00:27:11.28 you know my you know basically what I did in special operations and whatnot as a green beret
00:27:11.28 --> 00:27:17.68 and the enemy trying to kill me and that you know the the zip in the crack and you're not
00:27:17.68 --> 00:27:24.24 untouchable anymore and so yeah but that was the first first little idea I got of what of wow you
00:27:24.24 --> 00:27:31.36 know people they they do want to kill you yeah and that's a weird feeling yeah it takes a little
00:27:31.36 --> 00:27:40.80 getting used to spring in 2001 you get out get out of the navy you'd gotten married and again
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:45.20 there's all kinds of good this is good some good life lessons learned in this book very good
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:51.20 life lessons in this book so you get married you get out of the navy you actually married a girl
00:27:51.20 --> 00:27:57.28 that was in the army and so you get out you try a bunch of different jobs you end up as a bartender
00:27:57.28 --> 00:28:09.60 which echo supports September 11th happens and now you're feeling like you know hey maybe I
00:28:09.60 --> 00:28:14.96 want to go do something in the meantime I got to read this little section one day and early
00:28:14.96 --> 00:28:20.88 2002 I received a phone call out of the blue hi is this Ryan Hendrickson yes who's this it's your
00:28:20.88 --> 00:28:25.84 big sister Chris remember me barely I thought our family had been separated when I was
00:28:25.84 --> 00:28:31.28 still in diapers I had two older half sisters Paula was five years old and Chris was eight
00:28:31.28 --> 00:28:37.76 years older I also had a half brother who's ten years older than me and lived with us periodically
00:28:37.76 --> 00:28:42.96 his name was Robbie both my dad and his first wife were heavy drinkers one night she swept up my
00:28:42.96 --> 00:28:47.84 older siblings and disappeared I had memories of them but I was so young I didn't really have a
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:52.40 grasp of what had happened or who they were and now this phone call came out of the blue so that's
00:28:52.40 --> 00:28:58.32 that's kind of crazy yeah yeah that was that was something else and she wanted to contact me
00:28:58.32 --> 00:29:04.08 because she she basically said like you won't remember all the bad stuff so I'm gonna start off with you
00:29:04.72 --> 00:29:12.40 but it was when um is when that uh what is it not and sister DNA but whenever they're building
00:29:12.40 --> 00:29:18.72 your family trees or okay I like the genealogy type thing yeah so that's actually when everyone you
00:29:18.72 --> 00:29:25.52 know started getting connected back again and it was yeah it was it was crazy but my dad and
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:29.52 I we made a trip now and the new Mexico to see him and that was the first time he saw his kids
00:29:29.52 --> 00:29:38.08 in years years and you know and then we just you know we started kind of building the bridges back
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:46.32 and you know I learned I learned just how you know my dad like he lived the hard life you know
00:29:46.32 --> 00:29:54.24 and so I heard some of those stories and but that's that's the one thing that you know the
00:29:54.24 --> 00:29:58.80 people that are out there and they say you know people people never change or you you're not
00:29:58.80 --> 00:30:03.60 gonna change once your once alus are always alus or something like that and I look at my dad and
00:30:03.60 --> 00:30:10.24 I could be like I 100% disagree with you and you knew your dad as this guy that was kind of you know
00:30:10.24 --> 00:30:16.80 on such a good path in life was steering you in the right direction and then your older half-sister
00:30:16.80 --> 00:30:20.88 had stories that you almost seem like a different yeah she was talking about a different guy
00:30:20.88 --> 00:30:26.48 well I remember she said hey have you talked to dad lately and I was like yeah talking about
00:30:26.48 --> 00:30:32.64 the time he's a preacher and she goes no no no um Larry Hendricksson as yeah yeah he's a preacher
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:43.44 she goes it's impossible wow he's like no it's not well that's crazy now during this time also
00:30:43.44 --> 00:30:48.16 you stayed in the navy reserves which means you were doing your one weekend among or whatever
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:53.92 and then we go back to the book then an unexpected opportunity came up as a naval reserveist
00:30:53.92 --> 00:31:00.16 I could attend basic underwater demolition school at Naval Special Warfare training complex
00:31:00.16 --> 00:31:05.04 in Coronado California but six month long training class was part was the first part of navy
00:31:05.04 --> 00:31:09.36 seal training so if I ever wanted to become a seal and member of the naval special operations
00:31:09.36 --> 00:31:14.56 community basic underwater demolition school is where I had to start my wife Sarah knew that being
00:31:14.56 --> 00:31:18.64 part of special operations had always appealed to me now this opportunity was sitting right in front
00:31:18.64 --> 00:31:24.72 of me I had undergrown training as a rescue swimmer in the navy so I had assumed I had the swimming
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:30.32 part down when I was approved to attend the six month bud's course visions of becoming a sealed
00:31:30.32 --> 00:31:36.40 danced in my head I quickly found out how tough it was during the first phase of training a pre-bud's
00:31:36.40 --> 00:31:42.08 training course that lasted around three weeks from there I went on to phase one which consisted
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:47.36 of eight weeks of grueling exercise and conditioning topped off by hell week typically more than
00:31:47.36 --> 00:31:52.80 half the recruits wash out sheer fatigue and sleep deprivation caused every candidate to wonder what
00:31:52.80 --> 00:31:58.16 his limits are the non-stop beating that our bodies took from some of the hardest training the
00:31:58.16 --> 00:32:03.68 military has followed by long stretches of being cold wet and miserable with no time to recover
00:32:03.68 --> 00:32:09.36 took its toll when my body broke down from a leg injury in severe pneumonia I was dropped after
00:32:09.36 --> 00:32:14.000 three months of training I could have tried again after I recovered but I couldn't bring myself
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.40 to go through all that shit again yeah so what was what was out like going through buds or
00:32:20.40 --> 00:32:28.08 attending buds yeah buds was I mean I was class two four two I have to say we were a beat down
00:32:28.08 --> 00:32:35.68 class that's that's just my opinion you know how they have the classes where some of them are
00:32:35.68 --> 00:32:39.92 oh man that's you guys got secured early from hell week what not the next class this man you
00:32:39.92 --> 00:32:46.16 guys are a beat down class or whatnot well we we had a beat down class and it was it was intense
00:32:46.16 --> 00:32:52.96 everything that they talk about it yeah I the only thing I could tell any listener who wants to
00:32:53.76 --> 00:32:59.68 contemplate that route is do it because it's an experience that you'll never forget they will make
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:05.52 sure you will never forget it 100% those are worse part you think for you because you know different
00:33:05.52 --> 00:33:13.44 guys they dislike different things mm-hmm what do you think was the worst part for me the worst part
00:33:13.44 --> 00:33:20.48 actually once I got pneumonia I couldn't breathe and so on and so when we were doing
00:33:20.48 --> 00:33:25.76 drumperfine and whatnot like that I just my nose would just start you know opening up but
00:33:26.48 --> 00:33:34.40 I would I would have to say anything like on on the water fine under the water I don't I don't really
00:33:34.40 --> 00:33:45.44 like that I'm not a very big fan of that so when uh we'll we'll go back to the book here for the
00:33:45.44 --> 00:33:51.28 first time in my life I experienced a major setback becoming part of an elite unit with something
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:56.32 I wanted with every inch of my being but I couldn't make the cut which prompted a series of questions
00:33:56.32 --> 00:34:03.36 why did I fail why wasn't I good enough how come my body broke down was I that weak I had no
00:34:03.36 --> 00:34:09.36 answers and I came up with every every poor me excuse in the book you'd think that for a guy who
00:34:09.36 --> 00:34:15.68 is raised the way I was excuses would be the last thing on my mind but they were my crutch I
00:34:15.68 --> 00:34:21.12 slowly but steadily turned myself into a victim if only I didn't grow up in a broken family if only
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:27.76 the world and everyone in it weren't against me that just wasn't about buds but me not making it
00:34:27.76 --> 00:34:35.44 through brought my buried demons to the surface so even at this point you know you don't make it
00:34:35.44 --> 00:34:42.88 through buds and you kind of blame all these you know hate so because I was raised this way I
00:34:42.88 --> 00:34:47.68 hadn't used you know my death my mom wasn't around and you kind of make those excuses for yourself
00:34:48.32 --> 00:34:55.60 yeah I buried I buried myself in excuses and it it became very easy to do that it's very easy to
00:34:55.60 --> 00:35:04.32 to make somebody else the issue instead of looking deep inside and insane hey man just you know if
00:35:04.88 --> 00:35:12.48 if everyone can make it then it wouldn't be buds and so instead of understanding that you know I I did
00:35:12.48 --> 00:35:19.28 I took the it was it was more it was almost more entitlement then it was victim is like well this isn't fair
00:35:19.28 --> 00:35:27.52 why why didn't I make the cut and thing is I could have rolled back but I don't know how far did you make it
00:35:28.24 --> 00:35:34.24 all the way up to the end of the first phase so it was yeah it is basically they wanted me to go
00:35:35.44 --> 00:35:42.48 back to day one of phase one and I was just like and you know I just I didn't have it in me so
00:35:42.48 --> 00:35:50.40 but yeah it's you know it's it's one of those things I look back on you know and I I do I don't ever regret anything
00:35:50.80 --> 00:35:57.44 but it is one of those things around like yeah you kind of you kind of fluck that one of you know
00:35:58.32 --> 00:36:04.64 so yeah well you know when you say you had a beat down class more than other people it's like
00:36:04.64 --> 00:36:10.96 I'm gonna tell you the classes are beat down classes yeah they are beat down classes you're gonna
00:36:10.96 --> 00:36:15.84 get beat down you know I was over there a few months ago with one of my friends it still works over there
00:36:16.24 --> 00:36:21.68 and you know he was like there's there's whatever there's like a hundred helmets by the bell
00:36:23.04 --> 00:36:27.92 and um and he goes every single one of those guys is a stud that wanted to be he
00:36:27.92 --> 00:36:31.84 hints every season like almost every single one of those guys is a total stud that showed up here
00:36:31.84 --> 00:36:36.32 thinking they were gonna be a seal and they rang that bell man and he goes I go it's crazy he's he's like
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:41.28 it's it's crazy that's the way it is it's a crazy process it's a crazy machine yep
00:36:45.20 --> 00:36:54.24 so now you and Sarah she's done in the army you you you're you're now out of the navy and
00:36:55.52 --> 00:36:59.04 well here we'll go to the book everything was perfect so you're a Minnesota and that's because
00:36:59.04 --> 00:37:03.52 that's where her family's from yeah so you're a Minnesota everything was perfect except for one major
00:37:03.52 --> 00:37:09.28 problem I could not overcome my immaturity and my sense of being a victim when I refuse to take
00:37:09.28 --> 00:37:14.72 responsibility for my actions I drank partied and ran my marriage into the ground I used
00:37:14.72 --> 00:37:22.40 whatever excuses I could find so you're just on a bad path at this point yeah it's uh I was on a
00:37:23.60 --> 00:37:31.52 years long bender like I don't think guns and roses go to helld up with me yeah uh you get the idea
00:37:31.52 --> 00:37:36.80 that you should go back in the military um you obviously don't want to be in the navy your wife
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:41.92 was in the army so maybe you're thinking the army's about idea so you go back and check it check
00:37:41.92 --> 00:37:49.36 the air force mm-hmm uh you go here I looked at air force special operations combat control
00:37:49.36 --> 00:37:53.60 and jumped feet first into training I buried myself in every aspect of the course until a medical
00:37:53.60 --> 00:37:58.32 review of my record showed I had taken depression medication while in the navy a lot of people
00:37:58.32 --> 00:38:03.28 need prescriptions anti-depressants and depression ran in my family anti-depressant medication
00:38:03.28 --> 00:38:08.32 and counseling helped me through a very dark period of my life but this detour came back to bite
00:38:08.32 --> 00:38:13.20 me the air force decided that I was not medically qualified for special operations and put me in a
00:38:13.20 --> 00:38:18.72 job where they needed bodies I was told I would become an amunition specialist or ammo troop
00:38:20.72 --> 00:38:27.36 so you did they had you already enlisted when you did you did you had you already enlisted when you were
00:38:27.36 --> 00:38:34.16 gonna try for for uh cc-t yes yeah I was already I mean I was already a couple months into the training
00:38:34.96 --> 00:38:39.92 oh you are actually in the air force yeah going through cct train yeah I was at air
00:38:39.92 --> 00:38:47.92 traffic control school dang and then they told you no yeah I mean the depression medication it you know
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:53.68 it had helped me out through you know some events in my life or whatnot the one time I did it
00:38:53.68 --> 00:39:00.08 and um and but back in those days and I'm not making excuses for but back in those days you know
00:39:00.08 --> 00:39:07.36 the go to for counselors or whatnot is here take this take this take this and so it's okay I'll take this
00:39:08.16 --> 00:39:13.68 was that when you were in the navy so then you were taking a navy prescribed thing and they
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:18.16 they told you no even though you're taking something I was prescribed by the navy well I had gone out
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:25.28 for civilian counseling yeah but I had reported it all you know like you're supposed to
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.88 and but yeah I was I mean it's just back in the days when it was easier to medicate than to actually
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:40.08 you know kind of um face your issues and fix them man up and do the right thing it's just easier
00:39:40.08 --> 00:39:49.92 to take some pills and go to go to the spirit world I guess but yeah it came back and got me so but
00:39:50.48 --> 00:39:58.32 you know it's you know there's there's a path for everybody in life and and I firmly believe that
00:39:58.88 --> 00:40:06.88 you know the way my life paned out um I it was this this is the path that was gonna happen
00:40:06.88 --> 00:40:13.44 way before I was I was ever born I believe I'm you know God had this path laid out and you know
00:40:13.44 --> 00:40:19.36 I was gonna take some bumps and bruises along the way some big ones but you know now you know
00:40:19.36 --> 00:40:25.44 to the point where I'm at right now so you know I still make my mistakes I'm a man but you know
00:40:25.44 --> 00:40:30.72 I think I'm doing a lot better right you know building up people around me instead of tearing them down
00:40:30.72 --> 00:40:35.36 like one of the destructive paths I was on you know in my life so yeah I know that some
00:40:35.36 --> 00:40:39.52 well that's one of the best things about this whole story is when you look at something you took
00:40:39.52 --> 00:40:44.72 some major you know like but right there right those two things you didn't make it through
00:40:44.72 --> 00:40:49.44 buds and then you try for air force, combat control and you don't get that either like those are two
00:40:50.24 --> 00:40:55.36 things that people like that's that could be the last straw one of those things could be the last
00:40:55.36 --> 00:41:00.56 straw I mean and you've already been through the hard childhood so any of these things could be
00:41:00.56 --> 00:41:07.60 something that completely derail someone's life and and yet you're sitting here so um well let's
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:13.44 continue let's continue that telling this story of your path so you get stationed in Idaho your
00:41:13.44 --> 00:41:18.88 an ammo guy you end up going on deployment to Qatar while in your in Qatar you're loading up
00:41:19.52 --> 00:41:24.64 aircraft that are going to drop in bombs oh yeah they were they were winchestered every night they
00:41:24.64 --> 00:41:38.96 had come back winchester what you was that 2003 okay you get divorced now you go to Iraq in 2005
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:45.52 you're in Kirkuk and you say this Iraq was the first place out I was exposed to US Army special
00:41:45.52 --> 00:41:51.36 forces the Green Barais these bearded shaggy haired men seemed to play by their own rules we would
00:41:51.36 --> 00:41:55.76 see them walking by and later that night when the rest of us were hanging out after dinner the
00:41:55.76 --> 00:42:00.96 stories of what we thought we knew about these guys would spill out you end up in the you end up in
00:42:00.96 --> 00:42:07.28 the gym one time you're lifting and a guy says you know hey can you spot me and you look over it's
00:42:07.28 --> 00:42:12.48 it's this green baray as name is Johnny days later he introduced me to guys on his team one guy in
00:42:12.48 --> 00:42:17.92 particular a due-name Gary was in the air force before going into the army this got the wheels in
00:42:17.92 --> 00:42:22.96 my head turning what if I tried to become a green baray could I do it do I have what it takes my
00:42:22.96 --> 00:42:28.48 failure at buds was never far from my mind when I contemplated my future one thing was for sure
00:42:28.48 --> 00:42:34.08 I did not want to be an old man sitting on my porch wondering about what might have been
00:42:35.92 --> 00:42:43.44 so you go to Iraq as you're you're when you get back from Iraq you take some leave you go to
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:48.96 dude you're you freaking get after you were talking earlier about like you not leaving not leaving any
00:42:48.96 --> 00:42:55.76 any stone unturned you you do some serious traveling you go to you go to Vietnam you go to Ho Chi Minh city
00:42:55.76 --> 00:43:03.76 in the maycon delta and you got all really cool stories about all that stuff in here um you come back
00:43:03.76 --> 00:43:11.84 from that you're in Idaho and and again you know you're kind of drinking you're not feeling like
00:43:11.84 --> 00:43:18.96 your path you're on the right path you go on you go on a trip to Europe you go you end up going to Korea
00:43:19.52 --> 00:43:23.44 you get you end up going for it was that a one year deployment to Korea yes and this is still an air
00:43:23.44 --> 00:43:30.16 force deployment you're over there doing what an ammo specialist does yeah and plan rugby
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:38.64 and play rugby uh you go while you're over there you go to you go to you go to bank
00:43:38.64 --> 00:43:44.64 ox or you go to Thailand you go to China you go to Cambodia I mean you're bro you you're getting after
00:43:44.64 --> 00:43:50.40 which we do military travel you do in civilian travel so that was that was for my leave um so the
00:43:50.40 --> 00:43:57.04 30 days of leave or whatnot like that but um but yeah so Vietnam that was civilian backpacking
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:03.36 around Europe that was civilian everything was civilian travel and it was just trying to I don't know
00:44:03.36 --> 00:44:08.88 I think I don't really know if I was running from things more than you know I was just trying to figure out
00:44:08.88 --> 00:44:16.08 you know who who I was because I I had no I had no direction um you know I had um I had my time
00:44:16.08 --> 00:44:22.48 in the Navy time in the air force divorced which you know I I'm surprised she she made it that long
00:44:22.48 --> 00:44:30.24 she's fighter but it is what it is so um I ran that one into the ground um and I I think I just
00:44:30.24 --> 00:44:36.64 buried myself in everything that I could possibly do just to kind of like keep my mind off of the
00:44:36.64 --> 00:44:42.64 fact that you know I was turning into that I was turning myself into a loser basically you know and
00:44:42.64 --> 00:44:50.24 it was becoming easier and easier to give up and um and I I still I had that um I had
00:44:50.24 --> 00:44:57.84 buds in the back of my head the entire time and um it just I don't know as I really had I I guess
00:44:57.84 --> 00:45:04.48 uh come to Jesus moment when I started realizing that given up was becoming almost natural because I was
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:13.52 as the entitled victim everything was someone else's fault um and create you end up with a
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:18.80 girl named Jessica which is not a real name but you end up with a girl called Jessica and here
00:45:18.80 --> 00:45:26.32 and you're just partnering and you're boozing and you and Jessica I mean this is like the couple
00:45:26.32 --> 00:45:32.08 that we all knew when they were when how old are you at this point uh early 20s yeah so this is like
00:45:32.08 --> 00:45:36.08 you know the couple that fighting and yelling each other and then all of a sudden they're you know they're
00:45:36.08 --> 00:45:45.44 going to the club that just like you know I can I can I can see that scene yep uh and of course
00:45:45.44 --> 00:45:54.24 you guys decide you need to get married yep uh which ends up in a pretty quick divorce and at this
00:45:54.24 --> 00:46:00.80 point you you you write this in the book I needed a win a big win I was never the type to give up
00:46:00.80 --> 00:46:05.04 but with two blown marriages a failed attempt to become a navy seal and a feeling that I hadn't
00:46:05.04 --> 00:46:10.64 found my calling in life I was just settling and letting life run me ragged I needed to reset my
00:46:10.64 --> 00:46:16.16 failures with a major victory that was when I decided that there would be no more losing it was time
00:46:16.16 --> 00:46:23.28 to start winning again at the time the air force was overmaned in certain jobs ammo being one of them
00:46:23.28 --> 00:46:29.68 the army had a shortage of soldiers in certain career fields so the air force was offering a
00:46:29.68 --> 00:46:36.24 direct transfer to the army one thing my dad had told me years earlier kept nagging me if you
00:46:36.24 --> 00:46:42.000 don't try you'll never know and if you never know it's because you didn't try the answer was
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.52 clear I wasn't going to live a life of regrets even if the high risk of failure was there
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:58.48 after clearing my head I decided to jump head first eyes closed into the unknown that's you know
00:46:58.48 --> 00:47:01.84 you want to talk about there being a plan the fact that the air force was overmaned and the
00:47:01.84 --> 00:47:09.12 army would just do a direct transfer yeah it was it was it was insane because I was going to the
00:47:09.84 --> 00:47:15.68 to the S1 or the personnel office whatever to update some stuff for promotion and there was this
00:47:15.68 --> 00:47:22.64 poster on the wall and it had this guy in two uniforms half of them was an air um air force uniform
00:47:22.64 --> 00:47:30.000 the other half was you know class A's army said blue to green and that's and it it all kind of fell
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.52 within the same time frame as you know I need a victory I need I need something because right now
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:42.32 you know my I am I'm 100% heading down the path of
00:47:42.32 --> 00:47:48.40 that I that I probably won't be able to recover from if I keep you know because it's
00:47:48.40 --> 00:47:55.52 everything's in excuse and everything's everyone else as well and entitlement and victimization
00:47:55.52 --> 00:48:02.08 and I was I was I still wasn't far enough down the path to where I couldn't recognize that I
00:48:02.08 --> 00:48:09.44 totally became a victim of life you know shitty circumstances and so I was I was still
00:48:09.44 --> 00:48:15.60 able to see like all right you need a victory you need something you got to hold a lot of
00:48:15.60 --> 00:48:20.40 zeros going you need a one you know it's weird I'm what whenever I talk of that some people
00:48:20.40 --> 00:48:24.80 especially when people get out I'm like when you get out of the when you get out of the military you
00:48:24.80 --> 00:48:28.24 need a new mission you need to have something else to focus on but what's weird about this
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:34.16 is you are in the military but the mission that you had whatever that mission was it like wasn't
00:48:34.16 --> 00:48:39.68 bringing you the satisfaction you didn't feel like it was what you should be doing you know you
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:44.08 knew that you had more to offer and so you're traveling around you're looking for you're looking
00:48:44.08 --> 00:48:48.64 for the mission and you just couldn't find it and so then what this is the same thing that happens
00:48:48.64 --> 00:48:51.68 when guys get out and they don't have a mission to know the sun they just go down path of
00:48:51.68 --> 00:48:58.08 least resistance and well bottle the pills or whatever and it ends up bad you are still in while
00:48:58.08 --> 00:49:05.68 you are having that go on and luckily they had this opportunity to go in the army man so you
00:49:05.68 --> 00:49:10.000 went to army boot camp and you you talk about that and here was that was that a little bit of a
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.84 gentleman's course do you if you heard the term gentleman's course before I have yeah okay so it was your
00:49:15.84 --> 00:49:21.36 boot camp like a gentleman's course which in the military a gentleman's course is it's basically
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:28.40 there it's basically you're there to actually learn it's not like this be down thing you're
00:49:28.40 --> 00:49:33.04 going to actually learn stuff you get treated like a human you're not getting treated like a like a
00:49:33.68 --> 00:49:38.72 you know new guy piece of shit whatever you're getting treated well and you're there to learn that's
00:49:38.72 --> 00:49:46.72 a gentleman's course for instance I went to officer candidate school with all the other
00:49:46.72 --> 00:49:50.88 people coming out of college that go to officer candidate school that's not a gentleman's course
00:49:50.88 --> 00:49:55.52 like you go and you get all the full benefit of people the audience screaming to you but
00:49:56.24 --> 00:50:02.40 for worn officers or limited duty officers in the navy they go to a gentleman's course where
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:06.56 hey here's how you wear the uniform and here's here's what here's how you write these reports it's
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:12.48 like a nice transition yeah sounds like yours was somewhere in between you kind of had to go to boot
00:50:12.48 --> 00:50:19.12 camp a little bit but they were being cool to you so yeah infantry basic was that there's two
00:50:19.12 --> 00:50:24.64 things that happened there number one so I had I had done the the prior service
00:50:25.68 --> 00:50:32.32 course that they had for us in New Mexico which was supposed it was supposed to suffice as
00:50:32.32 --> 00:50:36.88 you know that was the phase one of infantry basic then you go to a IT
00:50:36.88 --> 00:50:42.88 you when you say infantry basic is that boot camp straight up boot camp so you went to his
00:50:42.88 --> 00:50:49.04 class in New Mexico how long was that course that was a month and then okay normal army boot camp
00:50:49.04 --> 00:50:54.48 is what 12 weeks yeah I think so they gave you a little short in course where they cool to you
00:50:54.48 --> 00:50:58.64 or where they yell in the screaming so new Mexico they can't really yell in the screaming
00:50:58.64 --> 00:51:02.56 bunch of you know they're a bunch of guard guys that were kind of which no offense
00:51:02.56 --> 00:51:10.08 definitely but they they were just there to check the boxes on us so they're there to actually
00:51:10.08 --> 00:51:14.08 transition you okay this is the way it works in the army here's how you wear uniform in the army
00:51:14.08 --> 00:51:19.20 these are the roles responsibility so it was it was a gentleman's course yeah that that was and then
00:51:19.20 --> 00:51:25.68 I get the bending for infantry and apparently I didn't get the memo that I was supposed to wait
00:51:25.68 --> 00:51:35.52 for a it so I started basic with everyone else and so the drone instructor he came up to me
00:51:35.52 --> 00:51:42.48 he's hey man you're not supposed to be here and I basically told him like I need this you know
00:51:42.48 --> 00:51:49.92 I need something to bury completely just focus everything I got on it bury all of my efforts
00:51:49.92 --> 00:51:57.04 into into into a cause and and I loved it like I loved it and he's like hey you know we're
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:02.000 you're gonna have to play the game then I was like I'll play the game I got I got nothing but time
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.52 so it was awesome I loved it and so I would think for a private going through when I went through
00:52:09.52 --> 00:52:16.08 they probably would say it was not a gentleman's course but for me going through basic you know
00:52:16.08 --> 00:52:22.24 our infantry basic and whatnot like that it was it was exactly what I needed at that point
00:52:22.24 --> 00:52:28.48 time every day was awesome and it just kept my mind off of everything that I just went through
00:52:28.48 --> 00:52:37.12 everything so but still didn't fix it just kept my mind off it you end up so you go through that
00:52:37.12 --> 00:52:45.92 infantry basic you go through a it you go to airborne then you start the 18x which is when you
00:52:45.92 --> 00:52:51.44 go in in special forces and you're not exactly sure which specialty you're gonna get they call it 18x
00:52:52.08 --> 00:53:01.60 and you go to this 18x prep course and you say this 18x prep course was extremely hard and
00:53:01.60 --> 00:53:06.64 pushed me to my limits I'm talking nonstop physical training 12 hours per day getting beat down
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:11.36 the intent to the prep program was not only to get a soldier ready mentally and physically for
00:53:11.36 --> 00:53:20.64 selection but also to weed out the week so how long is that prep course it depends but our
00:53:21.28 --> 00:53:28.80 18x or the prep course for selection I think ours was a month so four weeks and then from prep
00:53:28.80 --> 00:53:34.88 course you go to special forces selection yes so prep course is literally just to get you ready like
00:53:34.88 --> 00:53:40.64 yes hard PT's and they're trying to get you in good physical shape to be ready for
00:53:41.36 --> 00:53:48.16 for special forces selection yes or to help you understand that this isn't really what you want
00:53:48.16 --> 00:53:52.16 and so they don't blow a bunch of money training you they can just send you over to the 80
00:53:52.16 --> 00:53:57.92 second really quick got it and move on with life got it so now you get to special forces selection
00:53:57.92 --> 00:54:02.40 I'm gonna go to the book this was do or die time an 18 day gut check to pull out all the
00:54:02.40 --> 00:54:06.48 stops there was no way I would accept failure because I didn't think I could handle another
00:54:06.48 --> 00:54:11.28 fuck up in my life this was most likely my only chance and I was gonna make it happen everything
00:54:11.28 --> 00:54:15.68 that I had been through all the hard work I put in everything led up to this point selection as soon
00:54:15.68 --> 00:54:20.96 as we stepped off the buses at Camp McCall it was game on we started with the usual army PT test
00:54:20.96 --> 00:54:26.08 a readiness assessment also known as the army physical fitness test to my surprise some soldiers
00:54:26.08 --> 00:54:33.44 showed up for a shot to be the best failed the first PT test and we're gone on day zero fast
00:54:33.44 --> 00:54:36.88 forward a little time was flying by for me and I was killing it regardless of whether it was a 10
00:54:36.88 --> 00:54:43.20 mile run along Sandy backwards roads a 10k rock sack march with 60 pounds on my back a 12
00:54:43.20 --> 00:54:49.04 mile land navigation course rifle PT log PT with telephone poles or the dreaded team week events
00:54:49.04 --> 00:54:54.16 that broke the will of most of the trainees I was speeding through as excruciating as
00:54:54.16 --> 00:54:59.12 everything was I was amazed at how well I was doing the 18x prep course lived up to his name
00:54:59.84 --> 00:55:06.96 so you're kind of getting after it do good yeah we were constantly on the move 18 to 20 hours
00:55:06.96 --> 00:55:10.80 a day whether it was a ballbuster PT session or hustling from one event the other
00:55:10.80 --> 00:55:15.84 shot I came in snatches and meals were always on the go not getting enough food for me with
00:55:16.56 --> 00:55:21.12 not getting enough food for the number of calories I was burning took its toll after the first
00:55:21.12 --> 00:55:25.44 week but I didn't care while the lack of calories depleted my energy and strength that combined
00:55:25.44 --> 00:55:31.76 with my lack of sleep was all part of the mentally and physically breaking down a trainee so you're
00:55:31.76 --> 00:55:37.52 not eating very much which is one thing that I was was happy that I ended up in the navy and
00:55:37.52 --> 00:55:42.48 and going to budd instead of any of the army courses where you don't get to eat man yeah the
00:55:42.48 --> 00:55:47.92 the army seems to they they they really like the whole you don't need to eat thing yeah
00:55:47.92 --> 00:55:54.16 yeah the navy focuses on you don't need to sleep and and also you don't need to be warm which
00:55:54.16 --> 00:55:59.36 look range of school and freaking sf school you know it's not like you're warm cuddly there
00:55:59.36 --> 00:56:04.32 either now no the uh just beat down we just we're not under the water and that was good
00:56:08.48 --> 00:56:12.72 as the days turned into weeks our bodies are breaking down so I pressed on as we near the end
00:56:12.72 --> 00:56:17.28 the final major obstacle in my way was along rut march we weren't supposed to know the distance
00:56:17.28 --> 00:56:20.56 of the final trek but every selection class got the scoop from the guys are gone before we would
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:28.72 be going 25 to 30 miles turned out you guys went more than 25 to 30 miles again I'm jumping
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:33.60 you you give some really cool information and that's why people should get the book fast
00:56:33.60 --> 00:56:37.12 foreign a little bit after hitting the finish line we gathered in a large conference hall to
00:56:37.12 --> 00:56:41.04 hear who got selected and who didn't I could barely put one foot in front of the other but at
00:56:41.04 --> 00:56:45.92 least I walked in under my own power those left standing after the dust cleared look like they
00:56:45.92 --> 00:56:51.12 had spent years as POWs most of the guys hobbled and limp their way into the conference hall
00:56:51.12 --> 00:56:58.16 beaten down and on edge as I took my seat my tired head was filled with questions will all this
00:56:58.16 --> 00:57:03.20 physical and mental effort be for nothing did I give it the best I could do I have what they are
00:57:03.20 --> 00:57:08.56 looking for after a wait that seemed like days the selection cadre entered the hall to call
00:57:08.56 --> 00:57:15.76 off the roster numbers of the guys selected I was roster number 049 out of 185 as you went down
00:57:15.76 --> 00:57:22.40 the list he reached those in the 40s I held my breath and closed my eyes roster number 049
00:57:23.12 --> 00:57:31.20 selected I melted into my chairs the reef spread over my body out of 185 only 50 or so men were
00:57:31.20 --> 00:57:36.08 selected a little more than one out of every four I was one of them but I wasn't there yet I still
00:57:36.08 --> 00:57:41.84 had more hurdles in front of me out of the 50 of us who would advance to the qualification course
00:57:41.84 --> 00:57:46.80 less than half would become green berets those concerns didn't matter to me at that point however
00:57:46.80 --> 00:57:52.24 for now I saved my accomplishment I was on my way so you you do this freaking all this training
00:57:52.24 --> 00:57:57.84 of selection to how long selection 18 days yeah it varies there's some three week selections
00:57:57.84 --> 00:58:04.48 and whatnot but yeah I had an 18 day selection and then even if you pass everything you can still
00:58:04.48 --> 00:58:10.40 just not get selected yes there was a lot of those guys who they said hey thank you for coming out
00:58:10.40 --> 00:58:17.04 um you're just not what we're looking for good luck damn so you're sitting in there with your
00:58:17.04 --> 00:58:24.72 freaking fingers crossed yeah yeah dang yeah do you have any idea what they're like what is
00:58:24.72 --> 00:58:30.96 the kind of thing where they're saying that this guy's not not for us so the cause I would be pissed
00:58:30.96 --> 00:58:37.52 yeah some of the lessons that I've learned and some of the things that you know I can I think
00:58:37.52 --> 00:58:44.16 make a good operator regardless of what special operations unit you're with is a guy who's always
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:49.84 looking for work you're never stagnant look for work a guy who's always willing to carry the
00:58:49.84 --> 00:58:58.48 heaviest shit look for work carry heavy stuff and then the guy who he just regardless of how
00:58:58.48 --> 00:59:06.24 bad at hurts smile because you're making memories that you're you're just you're not you can never
00:59:06.24 --> 00:59:12.96 recreate it ever so look for work carry heavy stuff and smile yeah that's very good advice
00:59:13.68 --> 00:59:18.72 we used to actually we used to tell guys you know especially when I was running training that was one
00:59:18.72 --> 00:59:23.36 of the things we tell guys is look for work even in a tactical sense like hey you're sitting there
00:59:23.36 --> 00:59:27.84 with your weapon pointed down the ground bro look for work go find something to cover go find some
00:59:27.84 --> 00:59:32.32 hold security somewhere you look for work makes something happen and that's right in there I mean
00:59:32.32 --> 00:59:37.92 that's almost the same thing as carry heavy shit yeah don't be the guy that's trying to
00:59:37.92 --> 00:59:43.92 shark that yep if if the two 40s on the ground and everyone's moving to a different weapon system
00:59:43.92 --> 00:59:49.68 grabbed the two 40 because I can promise you one thing it will not be the heaviest thing you'll
00:59:49.68 --> 00:59:59.92 carry in combat training can't touch a combat load yeah no doubt so from there you go to the Q course
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:05.84 and I guess in route to Q course or part of the Q course the Q course is like a whole bunch of things
01:00:05.84 --> 01:00:12.80 racked up together right yes right so you do sear school you do sear sea school you you go to
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:20.72 language school which you did Spanish yes and and well this was kind of funny you're like
01:00:20.72 --> 01:00:24.88 before selection I was given a language aptitude test my score determined the difficulty of the
01:00:24.88 --> 01:00:29.44 language I would learn well let's just say that Ryan Hendrickson's test results were modest at
01:00:29.44 --> 01:00:37.60 best and I would not be learning Arabic or Mandarin Chinese so no so you also said this you
01:00:37.60 --> 01:00:41.36 would joke with your friends where you're taking Spanish I can barely speak American let alone Mexican
01:00:43.20 --> 01:00:50.48 teacher denoling so then you go to Robin Sage and Robin Sage is this famous green
01:00:50.48 --> 01:00:55.04 bra exercise that you do at the end of the Q course over a period of three weeks we would plan
01:00:55.04 --> 01:01:00.32 in full train advise and assist a resistance movement that on some level back the United States
01:01:00.32 --> 01:01:06.08 and was seeking to defeat the occupying repressive forces in Pineland which is a made-up place in
01:01:06.08 --> 01:01:11.12 Western North Carolina this would be by far the most realistic military exercise to prepare men
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:17.12 for what we would actually encounter while deployed when times were hard and I needed a
01:01:17.12 --> 01:01:21.76 pull strength from somewhere anywhere I would see someone in the course where I thought
01:01:21.76 --> 01:01:26.32 who I thought had no business being there someone who is riding the coat tails of others
01:01:26.32 --> 01:01:31.52 performing only when the spotlight was on him I would pick these guys out and think I'm not going
01:01:31.92 --> 01:01:37.76 anywhere if this guy is still here I'm better than this shit bag and I will outlast him no
01:01:37.76 --> 01:01:42.80 matter what then that guy would fail or quit and I would target someone else I knew that I was
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:48.88 better than I would use their weaknesses to make me stronger in a crazy way I fed off their failures
01:01:48.88 --> 01:01:58.64 be bad good or indifferent this was the mindset I used to keep pushing myself just I mean
01:01:58.64 --> 01:02:04.24 well for me when people were quitting I would always like damn what a loser
01:02:06.24 --> 01:02:11.04 I guess I had a little bit of that and there was a couple people that surprised me when they quit
01:02:11.04 --> 01:02:18.000 there was one guy in my bloods class that was like a he had gone to buds before he was in E5
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.04 he was probably like 25 or 26 years old which seemed pretty freaking old to me and like mature
01:02:23.04 --> 01:02:28.48 because I was still like not you know I don't think it all he's got this stuff off and he would
01:02:28.48 --> 01:02:32.80 give me advice like hey we need structures to do this you know and you need to keep this
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:38.56 mine I was like okay you know sounds good and then in freaking first night of hell week he quits
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.16 and I was like what you can what's your problem but the same thing I was kind of like all right
01:02:46.16 --> 01:02:54.72 well I'm definitely not quitting this freaking loser so then for 84 weeks that's 20 months from
01:02:54.72 --> 01:02:58.72 start to finish my tired and broken body performed at levels I didn't think we're possible I
01:02:58.72 --> 01:03:03.12 pushed myself to my limits and through to the end life had dealt me some major brod blows
01:03:03.76 --> 01:03:08.08 and no one knew better than me that I dug a hole for myself that was damn near impossible to get
01:03:08.08 --> 01:03:13.68 out of despite how much I had fucked things up I had pulled myself out of a pit started something
01:03:13.68 --> 01:03:18.72 and seen it through it to the end leaving nothing behind I'd given this everything and I had succeeded
01:03:19.20 --> 01:03:25.76 now as a green beret radar right the next chapter of my life damn that's already a like one full
01:03:25.76 --> 01:03:32.56 book right there just needed one victory yeah that's it damn um and I like what you said earlier you
01:03:32.56 --> 01:03:37.20 know you're talking about your dad being like able to turn himself around and that's the same
01:03:37.76 --> 01:03:42.24 you know it's the same story for you too you know you're going from a horrible spot where you've
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:48.80 racked up some some failures and then you just get it together get focused and you win you start winning
01:03:50.96 --> 01:03:55.76 fast forward a little bit okay here's the sergeant major talking you're checking in okay
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:03.60 you're the new 18 Charlie I've been waiting for I'm assigning you to ODA 7215 I knew the 7
01:04:03.60 --> 01:04:10.40 stood for 7th special forces the two for 2nd battalion the one for Alpha Company and the 5 for 15 in the
01:04:10.40 --> 01:04:20.16 company I knew my job as an 18 Charlie what talk about what an 18 Charlie is so 18 Charlie is a
01:04:20.16 --> 01:04:27.04 a demolition expert on ODA and we you know we have the different MLSs like the 18 Bravo weapon
01:04:27.84 --> 01:04:36.72 weapons expert 18 echo comms Charlie demolitions and also construction but state side you are a
01:04:36.72 --> 01:04:44.08 a a special forces supply guy is it technically engineering yep so that's what the Charlie is
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:49.84 yep and then you know the fox intel and you know team siren to Zulu and whatnot like that and delta
01:04:49.84 --> 01:04:56.88 medical so hmm so you say this and this is a weird thing because you don't think when you think
01:04:56.88 --> 01:05:03.20 engineers you think building and and constructing and this happens in Marine Corps too engineers
01:05:03.20 --> 01:05:09.28 becomes the people at handle IEDs so I knew my job as an 18 Charlie wasn't for the faint heart
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:14.32 while patrolling an enemy hell day areas of Afghanistan I would find myself upfront the tip of the spear one
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:21.04 might say with 3 to 5 Afghan counterparts who specialize in counter ID operations and we're very
01:05:21.04 --> 01:05:25.36 good at finding them we would be exposed to Taliban snipers or any run the mill dumbass
01:05:25.36 --> 01:05:30.56 waiting wanting to take a shot at us the worst part of being the man upfront was that I would be the
01:05:30.56 --> 01:05:35.36 first soldier to encounter the IEDs I'd rather be in a firefight with a Taliban any day the
01:05:35.36 --> 01:05:41.44 week than deal with IEDs which were a nasty but very effective way to fight a war one of the senior
01:05:41.44 --> 01:05:45.60 one of the more senior guys in the back corner spoke up you got a lot to learn in a little bit of
01:05:45.60 --> 01:05:49.92 time sit down and listen but most of all keep your mouth shut keep your eyes open this will be a
01:05:49.92 --> 01:05:56.48 fire hose and you get man you do a good job in the book of of talking about the team and checking
01:05:56.48 --> 01:06:01.84 into the team and you're a new guy and you go through all that stuff but we're gonna skip through
01:06:01.84 --> 01:06:06.96 that and people need to buy the book to get that information I'm going straight to Afghanistan
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:12.32 you're heading toward an outpost the outpost is called the alamo which is always a good sign
01:06:13.44 --> 01:06:16.64 yeah not sure what happened there but I don't think it ended up very well
01:06:18.16 --> 01:06:25.52 so here you are oh shit not only was I my first mission as a green beret but I was walking into a
01:06:25.52 --> 01:06:30.32 live combat situation could you guys have heard gunfire this wasn't a video game real 762
01:06:30.32 --> 01:06:34.56 caliber bullets would be flying this caliber of bullet would easily rip a hole the size of a
01:06:34.56 --> 01:06:39.44 silver dollar through a man's torso and tears internal organs to shreds we wore a body
01:06:39.44 --> 01:06:43.36 armor that gave some protection to our chest and upper backs but when a bullet penetrated the
01:06:43.36 --> 01:06:49.36 chest cavity nine times out of ten you were dead I was driving the lead vehicle when our convoy arrived
01:06:49.36 --> 01:06:54.16 at the last stopping point around a thousand meters from the alamo a call came over to vehicle
01:06:54.16 --> 01:07:00.000 radio communications all vehicles stop during our pre-mission brief that morning I remember being told
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.20 that we would have to make a mad dash over a one kilometer over one kilometer of open ground to
01:07:05.20 --> 01:07:10.88 reach the safety of the alamo so we needed to be prepared for that the alamo was surrounded by a
01:07:10.88 --> 01:07:16.72 you shaped ridge line a finger like natural rock structure that ran toward the helmet river
01:07:17.76 --> 01:07:22.80 then the call came over the radio all vehicles move I hit the gas on my RG 33
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:27.28 mind resistant vehicle and started covering ground within seconds a Taliban machine gun crew started
01:07:27.28 --> 01:07:33.20 sending rounds our way I heard pigs from the bullets hitting our truck thank god the RG 33 was armored
01:07:33.20 --> 01:07:38.64 sprays of dirt and dust from incoming bullets and golfed our vehicle my senses shot up to overdrive
01:07:38.64 --> 01:07:43.20 and adrenaline pump through my veins even though I was scared I had never felt so alive as I
01:07:43.20 --> 01:07:48.24 concentrated on keeping the heavy vehicle moving forward then crack we'd been hit the front
01:07:48.24 --> 01:07:53.04 windshield split in a hundred different directions like a spider's web crack crack two more
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:57.36 hand at rounds hit my windshield I didn't know how many more rounds this windshield could take
01:07:57.36 --> 01:08:02.64 drive my captain yelled from the front passenger seat we got to get the fuck off this open ground
01:08:02.64 --> 01:08:09.68 I jam the gas pedal to the floor board and push the RG 33 to its limits limits and RG 33 ways
01:08:09.68 --> 01:08:15.44 around 38,000 pounds so maneuvering such a large bullet magnet over a thousand meters of of uneven
01:08:15.44 --> 01:08:21.20 rough terrain was no easy task I managed to rumble to safety through the alamo single entrance gate
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:26.88 in into a large courtyard the other two vehicles arrived safely as well almost as soon as my RG 33
01:08:26.88 --> 01:08:31.28 stopped in the courtyard I jumped out and ran to the nearest elevated position in the compound I
01:08:31.28 --> 01:08:36.72 toggled the selector switch on my m4 carbine from safe to fire and started sending rounds down range
01:08:36.72 --> 01:08:41.52 toward the enemy for the next few hours we exchanged sporadic gunfire but I have to admit
01:08:41.52 --> 01:08:47.04 that it was hard to think clearly adrenaline had really taken over my body at that point training
01:08:47.04 --> 01:08:51.60 kicked in and I reacted with muscle memory that had been honed through hundreds of hours spent
01:08:51.60 --> 01:08:56.64 training for combat when my first battle experience was over I couldn't get my hands to quit
01:08:56.64 --> 01:09:01.76 shaking my nerves were tingling as well but I felt good the question of how I would react when bullets
01:09:01.76 --> 01:09:06.64 were flying had been answered that evening some of the guys looked at the damage on my vehicle
01:09:06.64 --> 01:09:12.48 we could see where the rounds hit even though bullets hadn't made holes but the indentations were
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:17.04 everywhere damn one more round hitting your windshield and it was gone one of my teammates said you
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:23.44 had been fucked up you got that right I said looks like you got your C.I.B. bro joked another buddy
01:09:23.44 --> 01:09:28.08 which is the combat every three minutes jet badge that they're telling you yeah you just got it so
01:09:28.08 --> 01:09:36.80 there's your welcome to combat yeah that was a day three day three and that that happened and it was
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.36 it was awesome it was awesome I mean it's hard to explain it it was so awesome that it you know it's
01:09:45.36 --> 01:09:51.52 it's a dicking you know combat's it's a rush so that's and I got that day three yeah
01:09:52.32 --> 01:09:57.60 yeah that's a that's a good welcome there it's it's I remember the first time I went into
01:09:57.60 --> 01:10:02.80 I don't know it was an RG 33 for was one eight I think it was an RG 33 I was out there was one other vehicle
01:10:04.64 --> 01:10:13.28 I forget the name of it so they had so the Mac the Mac these the RG 31s they also have the
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.92 MATVs or the Mac's I think it was a 33 but I remember driving through Ramani's I had
01:10:21.92 --> 01:10:25.92 probably been in Ramani for like a month at this point and all of the to all of my transits would
01:10:25.92 --> 01:10:30.32 be either in a Bradley which you can't see anything or in a humvee which you can barely see
01:10:30.32 --> 01:10:35.52 in your all freaking having to scan so the first time I rolled down route Michigan in an RG 33
01:10:35.52 --> 01:10:40.48 sitting at like 15 feet with the white lights on and the big giant bulletproof windows it's like
01:10:40.48 --> 01:10:45.84 the coolest thing ever you're like oh I'm good I can figure and you can look around and you can like
01:10:45.84 --> 01:10:51.12 really pay attention so that's that's it that's a good feeling as opposed to a humvee where
01:10:51.12 --> 01:10:59.68 it's awaiting to suck start an idea and yeah yeah so now you guys are doing rotations out at this
01:10:59.68 --> 01:11:04.72 place the album it's like a forward operating base yeah it was a it was a cop yeah basically we took
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:15.12 over a compound ill check in farm goat cow whatever compound and turned it into basically
01:11:15.12 --> 01:11:19.20 where we were going to conduct operations engage in Taliban forces along the Hellman river
01:11:19.20 --> 01:11:24.88 you say I learned quickly that 90% of a deployment was sheer boredom followed by 10% of heart racing
01:11:24.88 --> 01:11:31.52 terror and excitement each rusher combat left me craving more there was something about the
01:11:31.52 --> 01:11:36.24 kill or be killed aspect of fighting the game you high high that was dangerously adicting
01:11:38.64 --> 01:11:43.28 during my first three months in Afghanistan my detachment saw combat got caught in several intense
01:11:43.28 --> 01:11:48.56 fire fights but we didn't take any casualties the rest of the men of alpha company second battalion
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:54.40 however 2010 was proving to be one hell of a deadly deployment two men on a different detachment
01:11:54.40 --> 01:11:59.04 were killed in action including one of our air force counterparts and more than a dozen were
01:11:59.04 --> 01:12:04.24 wounded normally a deployment to Afghanistan resulted in four or five wounded guys and maybe one
01:12:04.24 --> 01:12:09.92 fallen soldier but our company more than doubled or tripled that amount one afternoon our
01:12:09.92 --> 01:12:13.76 team leader approached me to tell me that a friend of mine named Jason had been killed in action
01:12:13.76 --> 01:12:19.52 that day in a different part of Afghanistan Jason died in a V Jason died when his vehicle had
01:12:19.52 --> 01:12:26.88 an ID he said bam man this shit sucks are you gonna be okay I absorbed the emotional blow
01:12:26.88 --> 01:12:31.52 yeah I'm good I said even though my chest was closing in I hadn't known Jason that long but we had
01:12:31.52 --> 01:12:36.72 gone through a large portion of special forces training together back at four brag it's through
01:12:36.72 --> 01:12:40.96 training that you really get to know someone I knew I could always count on Jason for help
01:12:40.96 --> 01:12:45.12 there were times I felt like I was a fish out of water coming over from the air force the army
01:12:45.12 --> 01:12:49.20 but Jason took the time to help me whenever I got hung up on one ever part of training I was stuck
01:12:49.20 --> 01:12:54.24 with Jason was someone I looked up to I admired how everything was easy for him he was smart and
01:12:54.24 --> 01:12:59.68 great shape a super dad to his kids and amazing husband to his wife but just two months into his
01:12:59.68 --> 01:13:07.36 first deployment as a green beret he was dead in the past I had heard about guys from a different
01:13:07.36 --> 01:13:12.40 battalion or unit dying and I rack her Afghanistan but this was the first time I knew someone personally
01:13:13.12 --> 01:13:18.64 death in combat was not just something I saw in the news now it was personal Jason was my friend
01:13:18.64 --> 01:13:26.40 and this was the ugly reality of war I tried my best not to think about Jason's death too much
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:32.56 which was difficult I knew full well that Afghanistan was not the place to mourn the death of
01:13:32.56 --> 01:13:37.12 friends there would be plenty of time back in the states to think about that and try to come to terms
01:13:37.12 --> 01:13:42.96 with it I still had a job to do to make sure no one on my team stepped on an IED and a promise
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:47.28 to fulfill to myself I would do whatever it took to make sure my teammates returned with to their
01:13:47.28 --> 01:13:54.72 families in one piece in 2010 though Afghanistan was not getting safer and the real fighting
01:13:55.36 --> 01:14:04.64 had yet to begin how long did you guys been on deployment for at that point
01:14:04.64 --> 01:14:12.64 so when Jason was killed I think we both got in the country at the same time and so that would be
01:14:12.64 --> 01:14:17.84 two months and how long are you how long were your deployments at this point um they were
01:14:17.84 --> 01:14:25.60 they varied but most of them were nine months at that at that point so you're only two months into
01:14:25.60 --> 01:14:32.000 a nine month deployment you've already your your battalions lost a bunch of guys your companies
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:41.44 how did guys wounded and killed that your friend gets killed go and back to the book when
01:14:41.44 --> 01:14:45.84 summer was coming to a close my team along with other ODAs from our company was tasked with
01:14:45.84 --> 01:14:51.36 entering Choo-Too Valley I say that right yep from different locations and clearing out the
01:14:51.36 --> 01:14:55.76 Taliban to a central point which would send the bastards running for the mountains working against us
01:14:55.76 --> 01:15:00.80 however was the fact that this was not a covert mission everyone up and down the valley knew we were
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:09.76 coming which gave the Taliban ample time to place IEDs and prepare for us so you go you talk through
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:15.60 some of the planning and finally you guys go to execute this mission the date was September 10th
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:20.72 2010 each of us was carrying a different equipment carrying different equipment for the mission
01:15:20.72 --> 01:15:25.76 besides my body armor and amphal rifle I was toting a 60 pound assault pack on my back filled
01:15:25.76 --> 01:15:30.32 with ammunition demolition material food water extra batteries and whatever else I would need
01:15:30.32 --> 01:15:35.52 for three days my average fighting weight was 200 pounds but with body armor weapons ammo and my
01:15:35.52 --> 01:15:46.64 assault pack I probably took the scales at 280 280s being generous yeah
01:15:50.08 --> 01:15:55.44 you say during our final pre-mescent checks I had time to let my mind wander
01:15:55.44 --> 01:16:02.08 what will be out there waiting for us do they know we're coming how hard will it be to find
01:16:02.08 --> 01:16:07.52 IEDs how I react on the bullet start flying all these questions plagued my mind as I was
01:16:07.52 --> 01:16:11.76 watching the river flow in the light of the moon until it disappeared into the darkness this
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:16.32 seemed like a good moment to take out a small pad of paper from my assault pack and write a quick
01:16:16.32 --> 01:16:23.92 note from my family in case the worst happened dad when he Paul a Chris and Robbie I hope I made you
01:16:23.92 --> 01:16:31.44 proud if you're reading this note I did not make it death doesn't really scare me because I'm
01:16:31.44 --> 01:16:38.40 doing what I believe is right and just I guess that's really all you can ask from a man death comes
01:16:38.40 --> 01:16:44.40 to everyone at some point in life so there's no use fighting it when it's your time it's your time
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:50.56 and there's nothing you can do about it I believe I live as good a life as possible and I'm asking
01:16:50.56 --> 01:16:57.76 you not to stay sad very long very soon you will be joining me in heaven and we will again be together
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:08.80 I'll keep the beer cold for you all I love you Ryan I don't know why I chose to write this note
01:17:08.80 --> 01:17:12.96 maybe it was the fact that I was a new guy and had no clue what would happen on my first patrol
01:17:12.96 --> 01:17:18.000 that far from the alamo maybe I had seen too many warm moves and figured this was a good idea
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.92 maybe deep down I really believe that this mission was destined to have a terrible outcome
01:17:21.92 --> 01:17:26.40 whatever the reason I chose to write down exactly what I felt at that moment because I wanted my
01:17:26.40 --> 01:17:33.44 family to hear from me one last time if the worst happened I folded the note placed it in a ziplock bag
01:17:34.48 --> 01:17:38.96 so it wouldn't get damaged if it got wet and stuck it to my right arm
01:17:38.96 --> 01:17:49.04 front uniform pocket where God willing someone would find it and pass the letter along to my family
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:57.28 did you have the proverbial bad feeling about this up so looking back now and I remember
01:17:57.28 --> 01:18:06.08 sitting there and I got to think and everyone up and down the valley knew we were coming
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:13.84 and the first set of villages were deserted and so you know as you will see for bad time
01:18:15.12 --> 01:18:20.88 I don't I to this day I don't know why I decided to write that note again it could just be
01:18:20.88 --> 01:18:26.08 too many warm movies I have no idea but did you save it? I do I got it at home
01:18:27.68 --> 01:18:34.24 but yeah it just seems didn't you think you were jinxing yourself so I do worry about that a little bit
01:18:34.24 --> 01:18:38.32 but because I never wrote I would get that but like no I'm not writing that nothing's going to happen
01:18:38.32 --> 01:18:44.72 yeah good I just had this I don't know I just had this weird feeling plus you know being up in the front
01:18:45.44 --> 01:18:52.48 it's kind of like oh man and I don't know I just think I just think you know getting caught up in
01:18:52.48 --> 01:18:58.000 all the emotion of everything and you're amped up you're ready to go you're ready for the green light
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.36 and everything like that and it's like all right let me let me bust this out man because I just
01:19:01.36 --> 01:19:10.80 really don't know so yeah it was very uncertain what we were walking into yeah the freaking ied
01:19:10.80 --> 01:19:16.88 these are crazy you know you're going into an ied thick area you know you're the first guy
01:19:17.52 --> 01:19:22.08 and even if you're not getting an ied you're the person that's walking into an ambush oh yeah
01:19:22.08 --> 01:19:31.28 you're gonna get shot in the face good times so finally you get the call from Ben let's move out guys
01:19:31.28 --> 01:19:38.72 we slowly charged our way toward the village of sar-tutu in the distance sar-tutu is made up
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:43.68 of several mud-hut compounds in my group was tasked with clearing one of the sections keeping
01:19:43.68 --> 01:19:48.32 strict noise and like discipline we scan the hillside and the riverbank for any movement I kept my
01:19:48.32 --> 01:19:52.48 thumb on my weapon safety selector reddish switch to engage to kill the enemy
01:19:53.36 --> 01:19:58.40 taking fire from the Taliban was a risk we all knew as possible but the more likely scenario was
01:19:58.40 --> 01:20:03.84 experiencing a catastrophic ied explosion resulting in the loss of limbs and broken bodies
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:10.000 all the team members were fully aware that one wrong step could change their lives forever
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.44 my job was to make sure that did not happen these insidious bombs could be hidden anywhere
01:20:15.44 --> 01:20:19.84 buried in the ground hung in trees stashed in cooking pots inside the carcasses of that animals
01:20:19.84 --> 01:20:24.64 within car trunks are under clothing with the infamous strap-on suicide vests
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:30.32 while they might have been built with fertilizer and discarded spare parts and look like a junior
01:20:30.32 --> 01:20:35.60 high school shop class project i never underestimated the lethality of these homemade bombs
01:20:35.60 --> 01:20:40.96 all i took was a handful all it took was a handful of high explosives a few inches of copper wire
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:46.24 in a battery that nation could be triggered by compression the weight of a soldier or vehicle passing
01:20:46.24 --> 01:20:51.68 over the explosive charge remote control with cell phones or an electrical circuit from a distance
01:20:51.68 --> 01:20:56.40 the Taliban were limited only by their imagination which was limitless when it came to killing
01:20:56.40 --> 01:21:03.20 Americans moving up we intercepted a radio transmission from the Taliban indicating that they knew
01:21:03.20 --> 01:21:10.80 we were on the move and could see us at first the news made my heart race my palms got sweaty as my
01:21:10.80 --> 01:21:16.40 arm as my eyes darted around looking for anything slightly abnormal i felt i was starting to see
01:21:16.40 --> 01:21:21.84 things that really weren't there were my eyes playing tricks on me or my ears it seemed like i was
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:26.88 curing all sorts of things when we stopped to get our bearings the guys called this hypervintulence
01:21:26.88 --> 01:21:31.28 hypervigilance and told me that when danger was imminent your senses rose up several notches to
01:21:31.28 --> 01:21:36.72 high alert status fueling the high percent activity was an overwhelming desire to stay alive
01:21:38.48 --> 01:21:44.48 the village was deserted when we entered one thing every sf guy knew was that when you entered a
01:21:44.48 --> 01:21:49.52 village and it deserted you better figure that you're in for a big fight or a village full of iedis
01:21:49.52 --> 01:21:55.04 in our minds iedis were a cowards way of fighting but no one could deny that they were extremely effective
01:21:56.08 --> 01:22:00.24 we had to clear each compound or homes we advanced slowly and deliberately looking for anything
01:22:00.24 --> 01:22:06.56 suspicious or out of the ordinary that could conceal an ied we were professional soldiers details matter
01:22:07.60 --> 01:22:13.60 a slight delay discoloration of the dirt a suspicious pile of rocks and abandoned water pale
01:22:13.60 --> 01:22:18.80 a tree that had been tagged with a marker a disturbance in a mud wall or alone person walking
01:22:18.80 --> 01:22:26.56 quickly directly toward us anything mattered but we didn't see any people or anything questionable
01:22:26.56 --> 01:22:31.52 even though i assumed every doorway and window had a pair of eyes looking at me and my buddies
01:22:31.52 --> 01:22:37.04 after we hit our first planned stopping point the team broke up in a smaller elements to cover
01:22:37.04 --> 01:22:42.64 a bigger area in and around the village including a world war one like trench that ran adjacent
01:22:42.64 --> 01:22:48.16 to the helmet river one of the taliban's favorite positions to fight us from each element was
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:52.56 made up of two or three green berets and a handful of afghan fighters assisting us
01:22:52.56 --> 01:22:58.96 in clearing the village my element consisted of myself our team sergeant lance and six afghans
01:22:58.96 --> 01:23:04.08 one of whom was neck our interpreter neck wasn't the man's real name but everybody who supported
01:23:04.08 --> 01:23:08.16 our team was giving given an easy to remember nickname for the ease of communication
01:23:08.16 --> 01:23:14.96 our job alongside the afghans was to clear the first set of compounds running parallel
01:23:14.96 --> 01:23:19.68 to the river once the compounds were clear we would move on to the next set as i approach within
01:23:19.68 --> 01:23:24.72 15 meters the first compound i watched for everything and anything from movement in the compounds
01:23:24.72 --> 01:23:30.88 of variations in the terrain where i was stepping i stopped and turned around to check on lance
01:23:30.88 --> 01:23:35.84 who is behind me with several afghans he gave me a nod meaning i could keep moving with the afghans
01:23:35.84 --> 01:23:42.24 and check out the first compound i motion to nick to come closer tell your guys to move up
01:23:42.24 --> 01:23:47.36 and clear the compound i said keep your fucking eyes open we both knew what that meant sweep the
01:23:47.36 --> 01:23:53.44 car your courtyard while watching every nook and cranny for a rifle barrel waiting to open fire
01:23:53.44 --> 01:23:57.92 nick turned and relayed my direction to the handful of afghans soldiers instead of moving
01:23:57.92 --> 01:24:04.08 they stood there like statues as precious seconds passed by it became clear to me that they were
01:24:04.08 --> 01:24:08.72 not going to move what the fuck i thought do they not understand what i need them to do
01:24:08.72 --> 01:24:14.80 are they too scared to go i whispered a nick what's the problem it's too dangerous nick replied
01:24:14.80 --> 01:24:21.92 no shit of course this was dangerous this was what war was all about i knew they were scared
01:24:21.92 --> 01:24:26.88 i was too i figured they wanted the americans to go first because they felt we had better weapons
01:24:26.88 --> 01:24:31.52 and knew we were a better fighters i kept my cool and refrain from losing my temper but i was
01:24:31.52 --> 01:24:37.36 pissed this is your damn country so fight for it i turned around to have a war with lance
01:24:37.36 --> 01:24:42.40 went out of the corner my eye i saw nick moving toward the front of the compound about 15 meters
01:24:42.40 --> 01:24:48.96 from me where a wooden door into our first mud hut was slightly a jar what's he doing why is he
01:24:48.96 --> 01:24:52.64 walking into an unclear part of the compound without afghans soldiers leading the way
01:24:53.44 --> 01:24:58.40 he was my damn interpreter not a fighter i knew better than to yell out to stop him since that
01:24:58.40 --> 01:25:03.92 could have invited a firefight even though the Taliban were on the move tactically it was best to
01:25:03.92 --> 01:25:09.12 assume the enemy did not know where we were and to remain relatively undetected for as long
01:25:09.12 --> 01:25:15.68 as possible in case Taliban fighters were inside the compound and waiting to spring a nasty surprise
01:25:16.72 --> 01:25:22.80 lance grabbed me by the arm get nick away from that door this wasn't the place or time for an
01:25:22.80 --> 01:25:28.24 afghan rambo even though 15 meters wasn't a lot of ground to cover each step was a gamble
01:25:28.24 --> 01:25:34.08 in Taliban controlled area i carefully but quickly moved up to neck and grabbed his arm
01:25:34.72 --> 01:25:40.000 nick don't move bro we need to move back to lance's position in regroup this is unclear to ground
01:25:40.88 --> 01:25:46.56 nick looked at me we're going to back away slowly i continued i want you to place your feet
01:25:46.56 --> 01:25:53.60 over my boat boot prints and slowly move with me back to lance if you stay in my steps you'll be okay
01:25:55.36 --> 01:26:01.12 nick did not want to retreat we can still get our guys inside the compound he said no the time is
01:26:01.12 --> 01:26:08.24 not right i reiterated we need to get reorganized the firmness in my voice told nick that i met
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:13.60 business he started to move back from the compound and retreated slowly as well and i retreated
01:26:13.60 --> 01:26:19.92 slowly as well making sure i had my m4 ready to rock in case someone in the compound moved around
01:26:19.92 --> 01:26:26.64 the corner and open fire on us my eyes were sweeping the compound as well as looking where i placed my
01:26:26.64 --> 01:26:48.40 feet i took one slow step after another when boom a deafening explosion pounded my
01:26:48.40 --> 01:26:56.40 ear drums at the same instant a hot searing brighter than midday flash of light enveloped me the
01:26:56.40 --> 01:27:00.48 blast shattered the silence across the valley sending birds into the sky as they flap their wings
01:27:00.48 --> 01:27:06.56 and screeched the concussive explosion knocked me the ground like a blind side hit from a line black
01:27:06.56 --> 01:27:12.32 blind backer in an instant i landed on my back just outside the compound entrance the foul ammonia
01:27:12.32 --> 01:27:19.60 smelling air clogged my lungs and choked my breathing i instinctively rub the grip from my eyes
01:27:19.60 --> 01:27:25.60 and waited for the dust to settle trying as hard as i could to breathe but i could only manage
01:27:25.60 --> 01:27:33.44 the barest of breaths i fought for air as i fought for air a yellow brown cloud swirled around me
01:27:33.44 --> 01:27:38.16 i couldn't see my hands in front of my face because of all the dust in the air i shook my head
01:27:38.16 --> 01:27:42.56 and yon the couple times trying to squelts the high pitch ringing my ears but that didn't work
01:27:42.56 --> 01:27:46.72 then i opened my mouth the scream for nick wanting to make sure he was okay but nothing came out
01:27:47.84 --> 01:27:52.72 the thickness of the dust with the overwhelming smell of ammonia saturated the air
01:27:52.72 --> 01:28:00.96 and made it impossible to yell or to take a full gop of air i'm not sure what just happened but
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:06.32 if i don't confess here i will suffocate in those first few disorienting moments i didn't
01:28:06.32 --> 01:28:11.36 feel any pain so i had to be okay i tried to stand but then i fell back over and heep damn i tried
01:28:11.36 --> 01:28:16.40 again but i couldn't stand up what the fuck what's happening to me i was having trouble thinking
01:28:16.40 --> 01:28:21.68 clearly then in a moment then a moment or two later i suddenly realized what had happened i had
01:28:21.68 --> 01:28:37.52 stepped on an iED damn when you are going through that compound to grab nick there was still
01:28:37.52 --> 01:28:43.52 this was still there had been no compromise yet like it was just silence yeah there was no compromise
01:28:43.52 --> 01:28:52.32 there was the the quietest i think i'll ever remember any environment being was that's the scene just
01:28:52.32 --> 01:29:02.000 incredibly creepy and quiet and you're trying to step in the boot prints that you made when you
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:10.80 get when you went to get nick so you walk in backwards so kind of sort of you know all of us know
01:29:10.80 --> 01:29:16.88 that you never turn your back or your side to the unknown and so pass the breach point is the unknown
01:29:16.88 --> 01:29:25.04 so we have the breach or the doorway or whatever you want to call it and so what it what it happened
01:29:25.04 --> 01:29:29.60 was i was trying to move back but then you know how when you're the very last man in a
01:29:29.60 --> 01:29:33.68 patrol you're constantly doing the or what's sorry you're constantly doing the back look
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:39.36 yeah well that's kind of what i was doing making sure that my info was ready to start putting
01:29:39.36 --> 01:29:48.000 rounds into the compound and yeah so and it's and it's still like the sun wasn't up yet the the
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.20 sky was getting light but the sun wasn't quiet up yet so you know yeah it's just the perfect
01:29:55.84 --> 01:29:59.76 perfect storm it's like that time where you're not sure if you're better off with nodger
01:29:59.76 --> 01:30:05.44 an off nods like that moment of the morning yep yep within about 10 minutes you're taking your
01:30:05.44 --> 01:30:15.84 nods off and storm them yeah it was that that perfect moment of zero visit back to the book i
01:30:15.84 --> 01:30:21.12 so maybe came aware of the pain it was solely creeping in like a snake squeezing his victim to
01:30:21.12 --> 01:30:25.36 death i reached down from my left leg and wiggled it leg was still there bloody but still there
01:30:25.36 --> 01:30:29.84 when i tried to move my right leg however the pain was unbearable waving the sand and dust away
01:30:29.84 --> 01:30:35.28 with my hands to get a better view i could see my right combat boot was bent at a weird 90 degree angle
01:30:35.28 --> 01:30:41.28 it was like my combat boot made a T at the end of my leg the didn't seem possible that my leather
01:30:41.28 --> 01:30:46.72 boot could be twisted like that so i grabbed my right leg behind my right knee and lifted to get
01:30:46.72 --> 01:30:52.96 a better look as i raised my right leg up a tad my right foot flopped off to the side of my leg
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.92 oh shit the only thing connecting my foot to my leg was stringy bloody red muscle tissue and
01:30:59.92 --> 01:31:05.68 ragged skin what was more disturbing was seeing the stark white bones poking out of my leg i was
01:31:05.68 --> 01:31:13.76 amazed at how glistening white they were in contrast with my bloody leg oh god this was bad i'm hit i'm hit
01:31:20.48 --> 01:31:28.56 so what's crazy about these situations is when there's an in your knee these i.e.
01:31:28.56 --> 01:31:34.72 the environments no one can move like you can't just go oh my buddy's hurt i'm going to go help
01:31:35.52 --> 01:31:41.60 that's the wrong move you have to you have to actually freeze and not move yep
01:31:42.56 --> 01:31:50.48 where there's one there's five yeah and and you find out later that this was a little bit of a
01:31:50.48 --> 01:31:57.76 well not a full low order detonation but there was probably 20 pounds and only seven or
01:31:57.76 --> 01:32:03.68 only only like a third of the the the i.e. went off yep otherwise you wouldn't be here right now no there
01:32:03.68 --> 01:32:08.64 would be they they they could have put what was left in me in a plastic bag if the whole thing would
01:32:08.64 --> 01:32:13.84 went off
01:32:15.12 --> 01:32:19.60 these guys they do and again you know you do a great job describing the stuff in the book
01:32:21.44 --> 01:32:26.16 i mean there's one part where you say i hear the team sergeant lansiel don't move Ryan
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:35.12 and you help back where the fuck do you think i'm going as you're sitting there wounded yeah
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:41.20 second stretched by like hours i'd never been in so much pain or felt so alone it was like i was
01:32:41.20 --> 01:32:44.88 the only person in that village i lay on my side and the dirt waiting for the bright light
01:32:44.88 --> 01:32:49.28 everyone says you see before you die lans is the closest american to me but i knew he couldn't
01:32:49.28 --> 01:32:54.08 rush to me because i had walked into an i.e. beef filled area chances were that he would be next and
01:32:54.08 --> 01:33:01.44 then what and in that moment it was impossible it was impossible to think clearly this is it
01:33:01.44 --> 01:33:04.48 i'm going to die in this shit whole village in afghanistan
01:33:09.36 --> 01:33:13.60 as i lay there for what seemed like hours i prayed harder than i had in years this was serious i
01:33:13.60 --> 01:33:18.24 felt like i was in the cost of eternity i'd always heard there were no atheists and foxholes
01:33:18.24 --> 01:33:22.40 and i guess they were right i was a Christian who had accepted Jesus Christ into my heart years
01:33:22.40 --> 01:33:28.000 ago but i'd strayed from the path of righteousness since then to say the least none the last i made
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.84 peace with god and figured he understood the mistakes i had made in my life came back to me but
01:33:33.84 --> 01:33:39.04 so did the things i'd done right i asked for forgiveness for my sins and for the people i had heard
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:43.20 in the state of mind i was in i felt this could be my last chance to make things right
01:33:44.24 --> 01:33:50.24 suddenly i felt a calm comb over me that i couldn't explain explain the pain lesson as i felt
01:33:50.24 --> 01:33:54.96 like i was fading into a deep sleep i thought of some of the good times i had had in my life
01:33:54.96 --> 01:33:59.60 for the July barbecue was loved ones watching the fireworks without a care in the world traveling
01:33:59.60 --> 01:34:03.60 around the world and all the amazing experience that brought me but most of all i was thinking about
01:34:03.60 --> 01:34:08.96 my family and how much at that moment i missed them i hope i've made my family proud but i also
01:34:08.96 --> 01:34:14.16 felt a strong sense of nagging guilt for letting my team down no green brahe wants that to happen but
01:34:14.16 --> 01:34:20.64 it did i fought back tears because i felt like i had failed my team five minutes or so after stepping
01:34:20.64 --> 01:34:26.32 on the i.e. i knew i was hanging on for dear life i could feel my life myself slipping away
01:34:26.32 --> 01:34:31.20 i'd heard so many say that your life flashes before your eyes just before you go but that wasn't
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:36.16 happening i didn't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing stay awake lansiel don't pass
01:34:36.16 --> 01:34:41.20 out Ryan we're moving and you i skipped over this part but you had been trying to get a turn
01:34:41.20 --> 01:34:45.44 to get on yourself and you like couldn't get it done no i yeah i couldn't get it done because i
01:34:45.44 --> 01:34:52.88 um so i i pulled one of the rookie mistakes where usually on your kit you rubber band the
01:34:52.88 --> 01:34:58.88 turn a kid on correct well as you know it if that's security i'm gonna double secure it i'm
01:34:58.88 --> 01:35:05.68 gonna use the tip ties oh yeah so oops oops
01:35:05.68 --> 01:35:16.08 uh uh fast forward a little bit i felt a slap sharp i felt a sharp slap across my face and
01:35:16.08 --> 01:35:20.40 another and another each one harder than the last what the fuck i opened my eyes my
01:35:20.40 --> 01:35:26.16 found myself lying still in the dirt of the this pissant village my teammate George
01:35:26.16 --> 01:35:32.24 screamed stay awake Ryan keep your eyes open so he's just for his slap and you trying to
01:35:32.24 --> 01:35:39.04 so you are just all just blood loss um blood loss but i think more of it was shock and i don't
01:35:39.04 --> 01:35:47.20 i don't really understand how shock works but i i know it could kill you and so um there was some
01:35:47.20 --> 01:35:53.36 blood loss there but it was you know everything that had built up to you know George
01:35:55.36 --> 01:36:01.28 slap in the crap out of me um that was i i think i dealt with a lot of shock what was going on
01:36:01.28 --> 01:36:08.000 because i mean it's you know stepped on an ID yeah and then through they give you some morphine
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.56 and you get hive so it turns out you're allergic to morphine yeah it's not a good to have to find out
01:36:17.20 --> 01:36:21.60 eventually and again you gotta read the book but eventually Kyle who must be a horse
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:26.96 lifts Kyle couldn't move fast enough because he lifts you up he's buddy carrying you Kyle
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:31.12 couldn't move fast enough because his body arm and gear along with 200 pound man over shoulder
01:36:31.12 --> 01:36:36.96 LZ was long ways away more than 500 meters the team took turns carrying me while keeping
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:40.72 security high the Taliban knew i was hit because our afghan interpreted her monitoring
01:36:40.72 --> 01:36:44.88 their radio traffic could hear them celebrating and laughing about hitting me
01:36:44.88 --> 01:36:59.28 so they get you to the LZ um they get you extracted and then the next thing you know you're
01:36:59.28 --> 01:37:05.76 showing up in in uh tearing cot and then in the hospital you get pissed because they're
01:37:05.76 --> 01:37:10.88 gonna caught off your shirt which is one of your favorite lucky shirt my lucky organ ducks football
01:37:10.88 --> 01:37:19.04 share it yeah but they end up cut it off um and again you know you do you give you a great job
01:37:19.04 --> 01:37:24.72 talking about the medical team and the doctors, the nurses and the staff that freaking takes care of you
01:37:24.72 --> 01:37:36.24 and and keeps you alive, skit you stabilized and then from there you go to k af more surgeries
01:37:36.24 --> 01:37:41.12 they're trying to clean you know trying to clean it out and and then it's over to germany
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:50.96 you end up in ramstine um and then at long stool i mean then again i'm just jumping through a bunch
01:37:50.96 --> 01:37:56.40 of stuff that you got to read the book because you know it's it's all it's all part of the story
01:37:56.40 --> 01:38:04.72 what you're going through i mean yeah i'll pull one little quote you say so i'm out of patrol
01:38:04.72 --> 01:38:08.88 trying to find i.e. my damn metal detector wasn't working so i closed my eyes and stomped around
01:38:08.88 --> 01:38:19.04 to clear the root boom found one mission success you say here i've been to germany many times
01:38:19.04 --> 01:38:22.64 during my military career but this time it felt different because i was fresh off the battlefield
01:38:22.64 --> 01:38:27.92 to Afghanistan i finally felt safe from the aircraft landed no longer a dangerous part of the world
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:33.20 i could finally relax or so i thought what i didn't know is it now i'd have plenty of time to
01:38:33.20 --> 01:38:38.08 actually think about everything that had happened to me i would also have time to cry over
01:38:38.08 --> 01:38:42.08 my friends who didn't make it home alive the ones placed into coffins for the one way flight to
01:38:42.08 --> 01:38:48.72 dover air force base in Delaware a grim trip the no one wants to take out of time to think about
01:38:48.72 --> 01:38:52.96 the families torn apart because of war either because they lost a loved one or their soldier was
01:38:52.96 --> 01:38:58.56 coming home with a mangled body never to be the same again that was my situation as well i knew
01:38:58.56 --> 01:39:10.72 i was never going to be the same again all right um again jumping ahead here where you end up
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:20.64 at broke army medical center bm it bmc for exam use in Texas fast forward after i woke up
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:29.04 from my 15th surgery and unexpected visor stepped in my room where i was resting my father
01:39:29.04 --> 01:39:33.52 somewhere between me getting blown up and getting to germany my dad was notified about my injuries
01:39:33.52 --> 01:39:37.60 seeing my father standing next to my hospital bed in a sweat cake cowboy hat
01:39:37.60 --> 01:39:42.48 person is head and cowshit likely still on his boots gave me a much-needed sense of normality and
01:39:42.48 --> 01:39:48.16 safety this was a major surprise that it's good to see you my father gave my leg a long look
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:53.76 then he gave me the usual tough but correct opinion well i figured if you played with fire long enough
01:39:53.76 --> 01:39:59.12 you're going to get burnt looks like you stepped on a doozy glad your lives son from his demeanor
01:39:59.12 --> 01:40:07.12 one would think i'd suffered a little more than scratch for the first month of my time at
01:40:07.12 --> 01:40:11.92 bmc my father never left my hospital room on the seventh floor it was like you felt the need to be
01:40:11.92 --> 01:40:17.12 there for me observing protecting and taking everything in my old sister Chris who is my half
01:40:17.12 --> 01:40:25.92 sister from my dad's first marriage was also there and you talk about the just the doctors and
01:40:25.92 --> 01:40:31.04 the nurses and the health care providers that are there and what they're seeing every single freaking
01:40:31.04 --> 01:40:40.56 day how hard that is on them you get your your lead doctor a guy named doctor sue
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:48.40 and he comes in and you're talking to him the status of my right foot and leg was still uncertain
01:40:49.20 --> 01:40:54.72 i would lose the rest of my low would i lose the rest of my lower leg or was it worth trying to keep
01:40:54.72 --> 01:40:59.60 the damn thing doctor sue never sugarcoded anything even though at times i wish you would
01:41:00.40 --> 01:41:06.72 i'll never forget one conversation we have we have enough tissue to do a limb at salvage surgery
01:41:06.72 --> 01:41:12.16 he said well do our best to reattach your foot and lower leg but there are no guarantees because
01:41:12.16 --> 01:41:19.76 your leg is in bad shape we're giving it a 10 to 15 percent chance for success and if that doesn't
01:41:19.76 --> 01:41:25.52 work i asked we'll have to amputate but look on the bright side if this works we will rewrite
01:41:25.52 --> 01:41:30.80 limb salvage medical history well that was a ray of hope so do you think we should go ahead
01:41:30.80 --> 01:41:37.52 yes i do but this would be a long painful road it could be worth it in the end so what do you think
01:41:37.52 --> 01:41:43.20 i thought for a moment this was a big decision well i still have my leg i still have options
01:41:43.20 --> 01:41:47.52 but at the moment but the moment i have to cut it off there's no going back i reasoned
01:41:47.52 --> 01:41:51.36 you've been telling me that this will be the hardest thing i've ever done but if successful
01:41:51.36 --> 01:42:02.64 doctors will use my case to redefine limb salvage hell yeah i love a challenge let's do it
01:42:02.64 --> 01:42:11.92 like pain a picture for me what's connecting your right lower leg to your rest of your body
01:42:12.72 --> 01:42:20.64 so at that point in the hospital i had um this it it was called a um x fix it it looks like this
01:42:20.64 --> 01:42:29.44 giant bird cage and there's like 20 summod rods that they screw into your bone so my so
01:42:29.44 --> 01:42:35.68 you know obviously you need your you need your tip your tubula but the fib they weren't really
01:42:35.68 --> 01:42:39.36 worried about it and they said add the fib doesn't really do much for you so we're just going
01:42:39.36 --> 01:42:45.20 to let that free flow okay fine but the tip so basically what they did was they lined up
01:42:45.20 --> 01:42:50.40 the tubula the best that they could through the surgeries screwed all of the rods into my
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:57.44 bones you know upper and lower and i had i had rods going into my toes i it looked like something
01:42:57.44 --> 01:43:06.08 of a saw movie but and then yeah they just they they they secure everything together with just
01:43:06.08 --> 01:43:11.76 all these rods going into your leg and then the halo devices that attached to the rods and then
01:43:12.72 --> 01:43:18.16 yeah the only way you can really grow bone is through friction and just beaten the crap out of
01:43:18.16 --> 01:43:26.88 yourself and physical therapy and whatnot so you know i had about two two inches of a tubula
01:43:26.88 --> 01:43:33.84 to grow back and so i was yeah as well i did do some uh yeah some beat down sessions you know
01:43:33.84 --> 01:43:40.32 in physical therapy to get that bone grown so when when at like when it happened you describe
01:43:40.32 --> 01:43:45.92 there's just like basically a piece of meat keeping your leg how about nerves to the nerves get
01:43:45.92 --> 01:43:53.92 damaged yeah so even even right now i have um i probably have half um nerve function in my leg
01:43:53.92 --> 01:43:58.96 and then there's you know parts of my leg that i just don't feel at all and then there's other
01:43:58.96 --> 01:44:07.20 parts that are um hypersensitive and then and it's it's crazy but but yeah my right leg is
01:44:07.20 --> 01:44:15.20 a skin graph the bottom of my foot is skin graph it's it's it's pretty uh it's pretty it was it was
01:44:15.20 --> 01:44:23.04 pretty intense but medical technology and the graph the skin on your bottom of your foot uh so
01:44:23.04 --> 01:44:29.12 i have this during from i have this dream that i want to be able to kick somebody in the face
01:44:29.12 --> 01:44:36.08 because it's from my ass okay and then i could yeah this is that does that because i'm thinking
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:43.84 is the skin that's on the bottom of your foot is that like does it does it develop calisers
01:44:43.84 --> 01:44:51.44 everything now like it no it's it's it'll never go past the newborn stage damn yeah so there's
01:44:52.24 --> 01:44:59.36 yeah when i damage it it's it's bad so this so this whole procedure was uh was like a freaking
01:45:00.16 --> 01:45:07.20 bottom of the ninth like just last ditch effort hail Mary i guess we'll go football we'll go hail
01:45:07.20 --> 01:45:14.48 Mary scenario yeah um well to save my leg it was but for the surgeons because i you know i remember
01:45:14.48 --> 01:45:20.72 Dr. She's saying i mean fly out he's like if it doesn't work it's not like you had a leg anyway so
01:45:21.12 --> 01:45:26.48 you know just move on so um for them it was an act it was an excellent opportunity to
01:45:27.84 --> 01:45:34.24 to advance um you know technology with lymph salvage and one i like that and um and yeah it's
01:45:34.24 --> 01:45:39.60 uh 2010 was an excellent year to do it because there's a lot of dudes getting blown up lots of dudes
01:45:42.48 --> 01:45:50.08 man that's um that's crazy uh this is cool your your command sergeant major who you call Brian
01:45:50.64 --> 01:45:55.04 Brian was a man of his word someone who put his men before himself he understood those under his
01:45:55.04 --> 01:45:59.04 command took personal time to do what he could to ensure each and every man was taken care of
01:45:59.04 --> 01:46:04.72 he was a tough leader who had crushed you if you were wrong but he would go to hell and back
01:46:04.72 --> 01:46:11.76 to defend any of his men and you go into the book here one thing among green berets is the
01:46:11.76 --> 01:46:16.000 willingness to do anything to get back in the fight i was no different toward the end of his visit
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.36 i asked Brian the one question that had been haunting haunting me for weeks i don't know what my
01:46:21.36 --> 01:46:26.32 future holds but i will not let this injury beat me i fully intend on being a green beret
01:46:26.32 --> 01:46:31.04 and deploying again if i can get myself healthy will you send me back into the fight
01:46:32.16 --> 01:46:37.84 Brian looked at me like i had two heads then glanced down on my right leg he knew that he knew what
01:46:37.84 --> 01:46:42.56 was in the heart of every green beret but he had to drop some common sense on me you're lucky to be
01:46:42.56 --> 01:46:48.24 alive Ryan let's figure out how to get you walking again you've got a long road ahead of you
01:46:48.24 --> 01:46:53.52 relax and take it easy that wasn't exactly the response i was hoping for but hell i knew i'd be
01:46:53.52 --> 01:46:58.56 lucky to walk on assisted one day so maybe the chance of returning to active duty as a green beret
01:46:58.56 --> 01:47:04.16 were a little far fetched all it took was one look at my blown up leg and everyone knew this
01:47:04.16 --> 01:47:10.48 was something that just wasn't going to happen but i wasn't giving up Brian had my back but when i
01:47:10.48 --> 01:47:15.28 asked anyone in the hospital the same question i heard something like this it's cool the way you feel
01:47:15.28 --> 01:47:19.92 Ryan but you would be limping and impaying for the rest of your life leave the fighting to the
01:47:19.92 --> 01:47:26.64 young healthy guys you've proven yourself enough but before you left my sergeant major surprised me
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:32.40 Brian leaned in look me in the eye and made me a promise Ryan if you can get medically cleared
01:47:32.40 --> 01:47:36.000 i will send you back to afghanistan
01:47:37.12 --> 01:47:40.08 yep check
01:47:42.96 --> 01:47:49.68 that's awesome i don't think he quite realized you know what was uh i i talked to and we still keep
01:47:49.68 --> 01:47:55.36 in touch now and it's you know it's hey man did you do you guys think i was going to you know come back
01:47:55.36 --> 01:48:04.000 is man it's i mean no yeah i can't imagine here it's just trying to sit you know okay yeah
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.84 hey cool yeah i know you want to come back if you can get healthy you come back but really he's
01:48:07.84 --> 01:48:13.60 thinking i hope this guy walks again yeah it was and and not you know because i they did medically
01:48:13.60 --> 01:48:21.12 retire me and i had to you know fight back on the active duty um so but yeah it was uh it was
01:48:21.12 --> 01:48:27.60 one of those situations and i remember um i remember i had uh i forgot who he was either you
01:48:27.60 --> 01:48:34.40 they're not i don't know but um one of the doctors he said hey look man it's it's good to have goals
01:48:34.40 --> 01:48:40.96 it is but your goals aren't realistic you're setting yourself up for failure because you're not
01:48:40.96 --> 01:48:46.24 going back like this is the doctor told you this not doctor shoe but one of the other doctors yes
01:48:46.24 --> 01:48:52.000 another doctor that was a part of my um therapy whatnot and he and i understood where he was
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:59.68 coming from it's expectation management you know um and he said i my biggest concern is that you
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:06.32 set these goals up for yourself and when they don't happen you can't recover from you know not
01:49:06.32 --> 01:49:13.76 achieving your goals mmm especially as a wounded guy because we we all do it's you know i i
01:49:13.76 --> 01:49:20.16 don't think there's a single military member in the united states um armed forces that got wounded
01:49:20.16 --> 01:49:24.56 and didn't want to get back in the flight as quick as they could i mean they're probably is i don't know
01:49:24.56 --> 01:49:31.04 i don't think so yeah i've never heard of one so but yeah you just expectation management you
01:49:31.04 --> 01:49:40.48 got to understand like you can want it and it's a good drive but man it's you're you know you're in
01:49:40.48 --> 01:49:45.44 the bottom of your your in the bottom of the ninth just like you said so it's like you need to
01:49:45.44 --> 01:49:50.32 you need you need to do some management expectation here because like start thinking about other things
01:49:50.32 --> 01:49:54.80 start you know what are you gonna do with your life out of the military and stuff like that
01:49:54.80 --> 01:50:01.60 and i understood where he was going with it because um unfortunately a very bad statistic even you know
01:50:01.60 --> 01:50:08.48 2009 and 10 11 12 was um wounded dudes dying you know um commintan suicide whatnot and and so they
01:50:08.48 --> 01:50:16.96 had to manage expectations with you guys because yeah so i understood it um the other thing that you
01:50:16.96 --> 01:50:21.92 write about in here is the like you're on all these different drugs obviously for painkillers and stuff
01:50:21.92 --> 01:50:27.36 but it seems like that's just kind of sent you in like real super emotional you'd be like laughing
01:50:27.36 --> 01:50:33.20 then you'd be crying and sound like that was just freaking crazy yeah yeah the the drugs i was
01:50:33.20 --> 01:50:39.12 on i mean methadone for one oh my gosh it's i don't quite know what it would be like to be a
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:45.36 zombie but i'm pretty sure i got a good idea from that drug yeah methadone is a hell of a drug so
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.96 and that's what they used to get people off of heroin and you're just you they had you on it for
01:50:50.96 --> 01:51:01.60 pain obviously yep so crazy uh there's another got another got another quote in here from the
01:51:01.60 --> 01:51:07.12 old man maybe my left get the old man on the podcast says uh you know because you are you kind of
01:51:07.12 --> 01:51:13.04 like rock bottom you're all freaking emotional about everything and he says looks on you got Delta
01:51:13.04 --> 01:51:18.72 bad hand but this is a speed bump in life that's all how you handle this situation and pick
01:51:18.72 --> 01:51:24.64 yourself up will determine how this affects you later as bad as it seems right now as dark as
01:51:24.64 --> 01:51:31.20 the times appear to be never forget that with time you will heal and look back on this please don't
01:51:31.20 --> 01:51:37.36 allow yourself to look back and feel ashamed about how you dealt with this take control of your
01:51:37.36 --> 01:51:45.84 life own this situation turn it into something good learn about yourself in a positive way and I promise
01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:56.000 you in the end you will be a better man dad's pep talk man to pep talk meant the world to me i
01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.92 lay in my hospital bed that night and vowed i would never become a victim of life's circumstances
01:52:01.92 --> 01:52:06.48 i would use this situation to make myself even stronger i would face my demons which i had held
01:52:06.48 --> 01:52:12.72 close for many years and defeat them for years i had used my difficult childhood as a crutch after
01:52:12.72 --> 01:52:17.76 my father and mother divorced dad had married two more times and always seemed to find the bad ones
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:23.60 i did not trust women or really anyone for that matter which i blamed on my past before i became a
01:52:23.60 --> 01:52:29.28 green beret i'd two failed marriages and it left the path of destruction behind me but i always found
01:52:29.28 --> 01:52:35.84 ways to rationalize my behavior it was never my fault i'm this way because i grew up poor i'm
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.52 this way because i had a shitty childhood i'm this way because life's not fair everything was always
01:52:41.52 --> 01:52:50.40 someone or something else's fault i did not have control over my life life controlled me even
01:52:50.40 --> 01:52:55.12 though my dad had raised me right there were some things you just had to learn on your own the
01:52:55.12 --> 01:53:02.80 hard way the saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger seemed like the story of my life
01:53:02.80 --> 01:53:09.76 but it didn't just happen on my own i had to make the choice to become stronger that's when i
01:53:09.76 --> 01:53:15.20 determined i would use this near death experience to make myself a better man this will not beat
01:53:15.20 --> 01:53:20.96 me i will be the man i was raised to be i will take control of my life and finally be responsible for my
01:53:20.96 --> 01:53:28.96 actions even with this my come to Jesus moment i knew life wasn't going to get any easier as a matter
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:40.000 fact the hard work was just beginning i can take some ownership what's going on you're dad told
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:47.04 you to own it yeah i actually a lot of people don't understand this when i say when i say this
01:53:47.76 --> 01:53:56.32 but um stepping on that iED actually saved my life yeah and expand so the path that i was heading
01:53:56.32 --> 01:54:04.88 down i was i was going to a point to where i couldn't return from um just life controlled me
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:10.88 a victim of everything i was just running you know i would destroy people around me instead of building
01:54:10.88 --> 01:54:17.76 them up i was not a good person um even with the victory of becoming a green beret i still hadn't
01:54:17.76 --> 01:54:24.80 i i still hadn't faced any of my issues i was just i was constantly running for issues and um
01:54:24.80 --> 01:54:31.60 and there was always i mean there was always something i was just i was weak it was easy to
01:54:32.64 --> 01:54:39.68 to blame somebody or something or use the excuse of i mean you name it and i came up with it
01:54:39.68 --> 01:54:47.52 instead of taking i mean i'll use it um you trade market but instead of taking extreme ownership of your
01:54:47.52 --> 01:54:56.96 life i um you know i i allowed life to to own me and it did and it did and it wasn't until i
01:54:56.96 --> 01:55:02.88 stepped on that iED that i was actually able to get control of my life again what are the biggest
01:55:02.88 --> 01:55:08.16 things you thought what was what was like the core issue that you were running from what like was
01:55:08.16 --> 01:55:13.52 pent up in you that made you that you think like steered you in these directions where you would
01:55:13.52 --> 01:55:20.08 be being a tear people down like what do you think made you so kind of destructive i hated myself
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:28.000 i wasn't happy um i didn't know how to like myself i didn't i you know i always tried to live this
01:55:28.88 --> 01:55:34.56 other people's lives thing and you know i mean you see it today it's it's rampant where people
01:55:34.56 --> 01:55:39.36 they try and be something that they're not they they don't have their own identity and i had no
01:55:39.36 --> 01:55:47.28 identity because what i was as a person was was ugly and destructive and i didn't like myself at all
01:55:47.28 --> 01:55:54.08 and so i technically i was always running from myself in the easiest way to do it is to take a good
01:55:54.08 --> 01:56:00.08 situation turn it into shit blame everybody else for tear people down around you and then move on to the next
01:56:01.84 --> 01:56:08.72 lately i've been thinking about this um it's real easy when when you got an opportunity when there's
01:56:08.72 --> 01:56:17.44 an opportunity for you to do something and you either fail or you're scared to try one of the easiest
01:56:17.44 --> 01:56:25.20 things to do is say well that's not cool or that's not the important or that's not for me so
01:56:25.20 --> 01:56:29.68 it happens on every level right it happens on every level when you know oh you're not great
01:56:29.68 --> 01:56:34.72 you're not a great runner well running we we see here's a classic example in the seal teams
01:56:34.72 --> 01:56:41.52 uh running right to just running let go go on for run and people that weren't good at running
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:47.20 would be like running breeds cowardice meaning yeah you know we're never going to run and it's
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:52.24 it's funny thing you know but that's like a little bit of an example of what we do as people
01:56:53.28 --> 01:56:59.52 of saying oh well uh school doesn't matter right when i was a kid right school doesn't
01:56:59.52 --> 01:57:03.36 school student that was me all day long when i was going to high school school doesn't matter
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:07.92 why because i didn't want to try you know i didn't want to put forth the effort it's like oh so
01:57:07.92 --> 01:57:14.24 therefore it doesn't matter and it's something that we do all the time and people do it with um
01:57:15.28 --> 01:57:20.56 you know like hard work like starting a business uh and i'm not i'm not i'm not i'm not
01:57:20.56 --> 01:57:24.72 i'm not i'm not i'm not all into all that material stuff when really they just don't want to work hard
01:57:24.72 --> 01:57:29.84 yeah this are they cut it down and they actually will detract from people that are working hard
01:57:29.84 --> 01:57:36.88 there's and you could say this about really about anything right and it seems like that's sort of
01:57:36.88 --> 01:57:41.44 that's sort of it's not exactly what you're saying but it's something that i've been thinking about lately
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:44.64 as i look at my life and i'm like oh you know oh yeah that doesn't really matter i'm like oh wait a
01:57:44.64 --> 01:57:50.32 second does that really not matter or am i just am i just throwing that thing out because it's
01:57:50.32 --> 01:57:56.000 something that i don't want to do or i'm afraid of or i'm calling it not important because oh
01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:02.72 really okay well let's take a look at that let's take a look at that you look puzzled no no that's
01:58:02.72 --> 01:58:07.60 it's that's interesting there that because that's like a level deeper than like what's happening
01:58:07.60 --> 01:58:11.52 that's like kind of like okay so you know what sour grapes right you heard that before sour
01:58:11.52 --> 01:58:15.76 yeah yeah that expression so it's kind of the same way expand on sour grapes so i know
01:58:15.76 --> 01:58:23.76 your definition okay so sour grapes is like it's almost like jealousy almost but
01:58:23.76 --> 01:58:28.56 so this is where the expression came from found out where there was this fox and he saw some
01:58:28.56 --> 01:58:32.96 grapes hanging on a vine kind of high up and he's like oh i'm gonna jump up and eat those grapes
01:58:33.68 --> 01:58:39.04 so he jumps up and he can't jump high enough so he's like all right whatever all he any try is
01:58:39.04 --> 01:58:44.56 again still can't jump high enough he tries one more time he's like oh no i'm gonna get on this time
01:58:44.56 --> 01:58:49.92 is there they look delicious up there he jumps up he can't get him and he's like that's grapes
01:58:49.92 --> 01:58:56.08 probably sour anyway you know that's it and leaves so it's kind of that right definitely kind of
01:58:56.08 --> 01:59:02.08 yeah definitely kind of that I don't want it you don't like that yeah that's not important yeah
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:10.16 sour and if you let that if you if you if you continually do that if you continually to kind of
01:59:10.16 --> 01:59:16.96 shun and turn your back on everything that is a challenge you know like you could have done this like
01:59:16.96 --> 01:59:21.76 you know being in this freaking special operations you know after you after you didn't make it through
01:59:21.76 --> 01:59:26.08 buds you'd be like yeah being in special being the military stupid right you could have done that you
01:59:26.08 --> 01:59:29.76 could have done that all day long being the military stupid those guys are freaking idiots
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:33.44 I don't want to be like you could have you could have gone into that mode and you just turn your back
01:59:33.44 --> 01:59:37.28 and then you turn your back on something else and you and pretty soon you look around and there's
01:59:37.28 --> 01:59:41.36 you're just you have nothing left right there's no that you've turned your back on everything
01:59:41.36 --> 01:59:47.92 yep it becomes a lifestyle and that's that's when it's dangerous and we've all we've all seen
01:59:47.92 --> 01:59:56.000 people today that they have shunned away from anything that is that that they could possibly
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:03.52 fail at because of the fear of failure that they I mean they they've made that their life they
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:09.28 are that person now and that's that's hard to come back from you know what I really like about
02:00:09.28 --> 02:00:13.68 what you just said I really like the fact that you just because you know everyone talks about
02:00:13.68 --> 02:00:18.08 lifestyle in like a positive thing like let's a Gigi to lifestyle it's a healthy lifestyle
02:00:18.08 --> 02:00:24.24 it's a what and you're like oh there's another lifestyle it's called denial and making excuses
02:00:24.24 --> 02:00:30.000 that's a lifestyle too and it's a shitty one that means a bad place is that's interesting
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.56 the deterring other people down thing where you know how you say it out loud and it's like
02:00:34.56 --> 02:00:41.36 why would anyone do that like it's so obvious not to do that but I think when you're in it
02:00:41.36 --> 02:00:45.76 and you say you hated yourself right yeah we're even that's another one or it's like how can you
02:00:45.76 --> 02:00:52.40 hate yourself that doesn't even make sense right it's oh that's like expression but in a way it's
02:00:52.40 --> 02:00:57.52 like literally true where if you if you don't like yourself that makes you feel a certain way
02:00:57.52 --> 02:01:03.44 and it's it's bad it's a bad feeling we'll say it puts simply so what kind of relief can you get
02:01:03.44 --> 02:01:10.08 from that bad feeling is if you make other people seem less than and it kind of like relieves
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:14.72 you of that feeling just a little bit you know but not fully not even close to fully so you
02:01:14.72 --> 02:01:21.92 constantly gotta do it to feel better about yourself essentially yep it is it's a series problem
02:01:21.92 --> 02:01:28.48 we we see it in our country all the time right now I think that's actually what made me start
02:01:28.48 --> 02:01:34.16 thinking about this because I'm talking about oh running is but you're what you're talking about
02:01:34.16 --> 02:01:38.64 the same thing when you look at another person and instead of going damn that person's really
02:01:38.64 --> 02:01:42.80 accomplished a lot that's awesome instead you say well I'm not gonna be some kind of career guy
02:01:42.80 --> 02:01:47.44 that's chasing a promotion or yeah they they just want to get all those calls so they could look
02:01:47.44 --> 02:01:52.40 good yeah you just throw all kinds of hate at them yeah but the person that you really hate
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:58.72 those are those are the excuses I'm talking about is you make up your own demise you make up
02:01:58.72 --> 02:02:07.84 your own excuses as to why that is not your path into basically you demonize that person to
02:02:07.84 --> 02:02:17.04 make yourself feel better even though 90 that's great 100% of the time it's because it's because
02:02:17.04 --> 02:02:26.64 you're afraid to fail yeah and it's weird when you start looking at chunks of people that
02:02:27.68 --> 02:02:35.60 look into oh that lifestyles bad and it's like okay what do you really about about someone that's
02:02:35.60 --> 02:02:42.56 working hard and trying to be in good physical condition and trying to learn and trying to grow
02:02:42.56 --> 02:02:47.12 like there's people that look down on all those things which is kind of crazy when you think about it
02:02:48.40 --> 02:02:56.40 yeah yep all right hey tell us about the what do you call the ideal breed
02:02:57.12 --> 02:03:02.32 braids or is it ideal like do you how do you say that yeah it's it so I call it an ideal
02:03:02.32 --> 02:03:14.32 ideal okay but yeah basically it's Ryan Blanick he he created these things and it gives me a
02:03:14.32 --> 02:03:20.72 calf and you know push up you know I couldn't I got plant I think whatever one goes down I don't know
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:25.52 but I yeah I'm sitting here trying to tell you all right it's like an exoskeleton type
02:03:26.24 --> 02:03:32.24 brace that you wear that makes up for whatever deficiencies you might have yes you're moving
02:03:32.24 --> 02:03:39.20 yes and so it gives you know that that basically it's it gives you your life back and that's what
02:03:39.20 --> 02:03:44.40 allows you to keep your leg that's what allows you to not have to go through the prosthetic
02:03:45.12 --> 02:03:51.76 is because now you have this I'm not even going to try and say the name but it's it's long
02:03:52.96 --> 02:03:58.16 the you mean the intrepid dynamic exoskeleton or phosis that that's what I was going to say
02:03:58.16 --> 02:04:04.40 I understand you do you have to wear that thing all the time so I've actually gotten to a
02:04:04.40 --> 02:04:11.92 point now to where I've rebuilt back my leg to where I only use that if I'm doing anything physical
02:04:11.92 --> 02:04:20.56 like gym I'll have my ideal on or deployment I'll wear the ideal whatnot but here I know I came here
02:04:20.56 --> 02:04:25.92 without it on I didn't you're walking around I mean you you walk in totally normal walking upstairs
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:32.08 downstairs I mean it's awesome to see yeah and yeah until until you tell you cut on that one thing
02:04:32.08 --> 02:04:36.80 and it's that's funny and that's because you have no nerves or do you have like drop foot
02:04:37.44 --> 02:04:46.80 no I I don't have drop foot it's kind of naturally as fused itself at the the L okay yeah so
02:04:47.68 --> 02:04:52.56 but you know you can catch yourself and it's I think it's funny
02:04:52.56 --> 02:04:57.76 what is drop foot like it's like it's like it's like the nerve that makes you lift up your foot
02:04:57.76 --> 02:05:03.76 gets damaged and so your foot just kind of has done yeah yeah yeah yeah it did it naturally
02:05:03.76 --> 02:05:09.52 fused at the ankle joint so that nerve is gone but it's just the foot just stays at an
02:05:09.52 --> 02:05:17.12 out of no and Andy Stumpf has a certain amount of drop foot and from when he got shot you like
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:21.92 lost some you got some you got a bunch of injuries but he got some nerve damage and so his foot
02:05:21.92 --> 02:05:26.80 doesn't respond really the way he wants it to and he makes him pretty funny jokes about that
02:05:26.80 --> 02:05:34.72 I can't imagine it's it's got a funny thing so the army wanted to medically retire you
02:05:34.72 --> 02:05:40.48 at this point and and then they offered you kind of something called continuation on active duty
02:05:40.48 --> 02:05:43.60 which means you basically they're still going to give you your paycheck and you're going to
02:05:43.60 --> 02:05:49.76 some kind of an admin job for you get to 20 yep yes so I was medically retired and then I applied
02:05:49.76 --> 02:05:55.20 for the waiver which was the continuation on active duty waiver and I got picked up for that how many
02:05:55.20 --> 02:06:03.04 years had you been in at this point total Air Force Navy and Army 12 yeah something like that
02:06:04.40 --> 02:06:10.16 so you now did you is that a document that you like signed you accept that or did you fight it
02:06:11.44 --> 02:06:16.24 the medical retirement well the medically retired medical retirement you you obviously fought
02:06:16.24 --> 02:06:22.56 yeah I mean that that was so I was medically retired and then I came back on to active duty
02:06:22.56 --> 02:06:27.52 through a waiver got it so they medically retired you and then you came back on when you
02:06:27.52 --> 02:06:32.88 came back on did you have that limited duty thing the the the continuation on active duties that
02:06:32.88 --> 02:06:38.80 how you came back on yeah and basically what it is so they do it for green braise seals
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:44.40 raiders all kinds of stuff if they they spent that kind of money training you up we can find some
02:06:44.40 --> 02:06:49.84 review yeah absolutely no it's an awesome program and it's a good way to take care of take care of
02:06:49.84 --> 02:06:57.76 people yep then you find out about this program called four three yeah and so it's all about that
02:06:57.76 --> 02:07:03.36 Thor three program so I think I think this seals I think you guys kind of have some similar
02:07:03.36 --> 02:07:08.64 the return to fight program yeah we got all we got awesome people that are just doing everything
02:07:08.64 --> 02:07:13.20 they can to keep guys ready and if they get hurt to get them back in the fight yep it's awesome
02:07:13.20 --> 02:07:19.44 yep so it's basically that we call it the return to fight or the road to war program or whatever
02:07:20.16 --> 02:07:27.36 and it's hard I mean they bring these guys in from you know they were physical trainers for
02:07:27.36 --> 02:07:35.76 you know hockey teams or whatnot or like Paul he was he he was on Tito Ortiz's group and Paul
02:07:35.76 --> 02:07:41.04 did all of the athletic training for him so yeah you're not really going to tell him like it's kind of
02:07:41.04 --> 02:07:50.000 awesome it's like oh that's cute so and and I just I knew you know I I'd gotten myself back
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:57.28 to seventh group but I had a dead man's profile so I knew for me for seventh group to wave
02:07:58.32 --> 02:08:04.40 big armies profile I would have to I would have to tear up dudes in the Thor three program
02:08:04.40 --> 02:08:11.68 and and so I just you know I I was on this path of you know I I was getting I was
02:08:11.68 --> 02:08:19.20 rocking up victories in my life and and so the Thor three program was it was tough it was extremely
02:08:19.20 --> 02:08:24.08 hard but guys that had never been hurt before I was just you know with all the physical events
02:08:24.08 --> 02:08:27.84 and everything like that just leave me in the middle dust but you know they weren't really
02:08:27.84 --> 02:08:34.32 fighting for anything I was I was trying to get back to war so um and then
02:08:34.32 --> 02:08:40.24 you you end up pulling it off man yeah yeah uh here you go after a few months of working with it
02:08:40.24 --> 02:08:44.48 with a Thor three program building up my body and rehabbing my store right leg and pressing my
02:08:44.48 --> 02:08:48.96 PT's on how far I'd come my command gave me some great news I was good to deploy
02:08:51.04 --> 02:08:56.88 when seventh group would take full responsibility for me my waiver was signed I was jacked
02:08:56.88 --> 02:09:01.36 from the moment I got the word from Brian that if I could get healthy enough huge semi back I had
02:09:01.36 --> 02:09:06.000 only one goal in my head to return to combat this was why I'd put in all the hard work I didn't
02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.92 want to be cooped up in some cubicle reading reports and looking at the clock counting down
02:09:09.92 --> 02:09:14.16 the hours until I would call today I want to be conducting missions with the guys doing what I
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:19.04 was trained to do taking the flight to the enemy my company had already left for Afghanistan but once
02:09:19.04 --> 02:09:24.72 I got the medical waiver signed by seventh group lead surgeon I was on the next flight out April
02:09:24.72 --> 02:09:32.48 2012 I would be deployed to the Pange Y is that right? uh Pange way district and can't
02:09:32.48 --> 02:09:37.28 to hard province in southern Afghanistan known as the birthplace of the Taliban times could have been
02:09:37.28 --> 02:09:46.16 tensor in the area so there you go man yeah yeah I got my wish return returned to war and then
02:09:46.16 --> 02:09:54.32 I got sent to the the most heavily IED area in Afghanistan in 2012 bro this is this is freaking
02:09:54.96 --> 02:10:03.52 all right so here we go you're you get sent to the most heavily IED place I was reading this
02:10:03.52 --> 02:10:10.32 I was like all right I'll just read it so here we go you're on you're on a really hard patrol
02:10:10.32 --> 02:10:16.24 to get to where you're going to get to the target area your the freaking point man again
02:10:17.20 --> 02:10:21.52 by the way the last time you were a point man you you got freaking blown up yeah
02:10:22.64 --> 02:10:29.28 you start you start clearing this compound again this is like deja vu back to the book we were
02:10:29.28 --> 02:10:34.32 barely underway when one of my afghan special forces soldiers and I detected our first IED
02:10:34.32 --> 02:10:40.16 and a partially collapsed outside wall of the first compound there it was buried in the dirt
02:10:40.16 --> 02:10:45.12 surrounded by rubble from a break in the wall that was likely caused by a previous IED blast
02:10:45.12 --> 02:10:51.12 or an RPG strike a nice little IED all you had to do is trip this sucker all you had to do to trip
02:10:51.12 --> 02:10:55.44 this sucker was step on the pressure plates that connected the positive wires to the negative
02:10:55.44 --> 02:10:59.44 once the circuit was completed boom the charge went off and your life was changed forever
02:10:59.44 --> 02:11:04.48 welcome back to afghanistan the Taliban had figured we would take this route because it was a
02:11:04.48 --> 02:11:10.72 short cut into the compound I have to admit that finding my first IED since nearly losing my life
02:11:10.72 --> 02:11:16.16 especially a nasty one like this produced a whole range of emotions my heart was racing
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:21.28 but I had to keep it together because my team was watching really you have to admit that you had
02:11:21.28 --> 02:11:29.12 some some emotions first I slowly pushed the dirt away exposing the corners of the pressure
02:11:29.12 --> 02:11:34.40 plate I studied my hands and searched for the arming wires when I uncovered them I trace the
02:11:34.40 --> 02:11:39.68 wires to a battery pack hidden behind some rocks then I disconnected the power source and clamped
02:11:39.68 --> 02:11:44.96 surgical clamps to the wire my surgical clamps were attached to a 50 foot nylon cord so I could
02:11:44.96 --> 02:11:50.56 get some standoff or safe distance before pulling out the pressure plate after moving the team back I
02:11:50.56 --> 02:11:55.76 got my 50 feet of standoff and gave the cord a pull the pressure plate came flying through the air
02:11:55.76 --> 02:12:01.44 the first step was complete but the IED was not completely disarmed I then attached my cord to a
02:12:01.44 --> 02:12:07.76 plastic yellow jug buried beneath the pressure plate and returned my to my 50 foot withdrawal distance
02:12:07.76 --> 02:12:12.16 after a tug of war match with the jug I was finally able to yank it out of the ground crap
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:17.12 this was a 15 pound IED more than enough to kill you or blow off both your legs
02:12:18.32 --> 02:12:22.88 how come I didn't just safely blow up the IED which is exactly what I was asking but normal
02:12:22.88 --> 02:12:27.12 procedure is when you find a freaking IED you put some explosives on your blow that thing up
02:12:27.12 --> 02:12:33.84 blow in place. Bip. Yep. Usually when I come across an idea I exposed part of the pressure plate
02:12:33.84 --> 02:12:38.56 to verify it was natural explosive then I would place a half block of C4 on it and blow it in place
02:12:39.12 --> 02:12:43.84 but we were trying to track down the IED makers in our area I decided to disarmed the IED instead
02:12:43.84 --> 02:12:48.80 of blowing it up because of the increased pressure we were getting to collect evidence which was
02:12:48.80 --> 02:12:54.32 key to finding the culprits with this first IED out of the way I breathed the deep sigh relief
02:12:54.32 --> 02:12:59.68 things had gone well and it almost felt like I knew what I was doing better yet I gave my teammates
02:12:59.68 --> 02:13:04.000 a warm fuzzy feeling about my capabilities and showed them that I could be an asset rather than
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.32 a liability on the battlefield why did I deal with the IED instead of directing one of our
02:13:10.32 --> 02:13:16.000 afghan counter IEDs to get on it you could call me stupid or crazy but I wanted to get some
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:25.04 IEDs under my belt okay I mean I you're not stupid so I guess we're going with crazy
02:13:26.24 --> 02:13:30.72 and I guess you want to get some IEDs under your belt has been to get an IEDs under your foot
02:13:30.72 --> 02:13:37.20 yeah I think I think my mindset at that time was very I mean could have been
02:13:38.32 --> 02:13:44.08 pretty deemed as pretty reckless but I just then that was the first one I came in contact with
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:50.24 and I was going to own it yeah that's just kind of that's the choice I made if I was to go back I would
02:13:50.24 --> 02:13:57.76 stick half-blocksy for on and move back and that's what you're doing man IED after IED cash after
02:13:57.76 --> 02:14:01.36 cash every time we go out on a mission one thing was certain is the sun coming up in the
02:14:01.36 --> 02:14:07.60 morning we'd run into some sort of explosive device made to kill or maymust and you know I I
02:14:07.60 --> 02:14:10.72 skipped through the part where you kind of like we're checking back in with the team and these
02:14:10.72 --> 02:14:14.88 guys are thinking hey can this guy really do his job and he's already how scared is he going to be
02:14:14.88 --> 02:14:19.84 how bad is his leg he's out here with a freaking brace on his leg what kind of you know so you
02:14:19.84 --> 02:14:22.88 had to kind of push through all that it kind of skipped through but it's a really interesting part of
02:14:22.88 --> 02:14:29.28 the book as well yeah I mean and and that's the thing is I've I've heard people's reaction to it
02:14:29.28 --> 02:14:33.92 they're like oh well that's that's that's just so messed up and I was like it's not that's special
02:14:33.92 --> 02:14:40.000 operations when you go out to the team being in war isn't a make-a-wish foundation kind of thing
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.56 like oh you know here's our make-a-wish foundation green beret we're gonna take them out on some missions
02:14:44.56 --> 02:14:51.60 no people people can die and and so I understood completely like they knew what had happened to me
02:14:51.60 --> 02:14:59.36 most of the team was on the battlefield that day in the helmet saw my leg and so for me to get back
02:14:59.36 --> 02:15:06.48 out to the team in the most heavily ied area in afghanistan at that point I don't blame like what are
02:15:06.48 --> 02:15:10.88 you doing here dude like you have no business being out here but you got to prove it
02:15:12.88 --> 02:15:17.52 another cool I'm not gonna read the whole section but you're talking about like what you're looking for
02:15:17.52 --> 02:15:22.48 and one thing you said is you you you'd you'd be looking and you'd be thinking what I put an
02:15:22.48 --> 02:15:26.64 ID there if I was a bad guy that was kind of the perception you looked at everything with oh yeah
02:15:26.64 --> 02:15:32.80 I get asked this question a lot about how do I find ied's and they're like oh yeah the mine detector
02:15:32.80 --> 02:15:38.72 my detector doesn't really do anything for me I look at so I I take a breakdown of the battlefield
02:15:38.72 --> 02:15:45.60 or the objective that we're going on to and then I look at okay so the easiest avenues of approach
02:15:45.60 --> 02:15:50.24 they're gonna be ied's there you got a 12 foot mud hut wall and there's a break in the wall right
02:15:50.24 --> 02:15:56.08 here and then it's 12 feet again there's gonna be an ied there and then I also so before I even
02:15:56.08 --> 02:16:03.68 use my mind detector I get ground sign ground sign tells me everything and then I verify it with
02:16:03.68 --> 02:16:11.28 my mind detector and then I mean I've I've definitely come up to like breaks in the wall and whatnot
02:16:11.28 --> 02:16:15.52 and I don't even use my mind detector or anything I just put a block a c4 there get back and
02:16:15.52 --> 02:16:23.12 whoa yeah because it's gonna be one there and so how much of how much do you think like a one
02:16:23.12 --> 02:16:27.44 thing I was always paranoid about it's like oh they got the fake ied there and did this in
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:32.000 remodio a lot like oh there's a wire and whatever and someone goes over to disarm it and they step
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.36 on something else to get blown up yep the decoys the decoys are nasty super nasty and that
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:43.04 that goes back to that you know that saying that we've all had and I guarantee you guys probably
02:16:43.04 --> 02:16:49.76 said it in remodie was where there's one there's five you know you know where there's one there
02:16:49.76 --> 02:16:54.32 could be ten or what but where there's one there's gonna be secondary because when that guy hits
02:16:54.32 --> 02:16:59.20 one of them then the rescue teams gonna come in and they're gonna start hitting the secondarys or
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:05.44 we're gonna use one as a decoy and then we're pretty sure we can funnel with this decoy here now I
02:17:05.44 --> 02:17:11.52 can funnel the troop movement this way and then it's all iedd yeah and my point in bringing that up
02:17:11.52 --> 02:17:17.12 is like it's it's it's it's it's not checkers it's not like oh there's an obvious place there's
02:17:17.12 --> 02:17:20.88 an ID it's chess where it's like oh there's one there but that means they're probably thinking
02:17:20.88 --> 02:17:25.36 we're gonna move over there so in the place we really need to watch out for it so the Taliban are
02:17:25.36 --> 02:17:33.12 super good at that crazy good at trying to anticipate troop movements and then iedd's you're
02:17:33.12 --> 02:17:40.56 carrying on with the deployment months go by and at one point you're in a little bit of a firefight
02:17:40.56 --> 02:17:49.84 and you you step into basically a shit ditch and it's filled with shit it's filled with human
02:17:49.84 --> 02:17:54.96 sewage which is which socks because it's staying since it's gross and all that but the real
02:17:54.96 --> 02:18:02.48 problem is you got your you know your foot which is a bunch of skin graphs is in there and this is
02:18:02.48 --> 02:18:07.12 after a long patrol so you already got blisters and whatnot because you got freaking baby
02:18:07.12 --> 02:18:18.08 skin on the bottom of your foot yeah open blisters so that is a problem yeah i mean we we got we
02:18:18.08 --> 02:18:24.56 got in a bit of a tick and every every war fighter knows cover and then return fire
02:18:24.56 --> 02:18:29.28 violence of action everything like that to you know get control the situation again
02:18:30.08 --> 02:18:35.92 and so i remember you know we're we're engaging you know different targets and i was you know
02:18:35.92 --> 02:18:41.76 my my adrenaline was really high but it still is man something really sick here it's like what in
02:18:41.76 --> 02:18:46.88 the heck is this and i just and then finally once you know it's like all right we got aircraft
02:18:46.88 --> 02:18:53.12 on station which means bad guys are gone so then i start to kind of get a sense of my surroundings
02:18:53.12 --> 02:19:00.88 and as a shit trench then i was up to my my calves and and so all of the open sores that i had
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:09.36 where my skin graphs were just human feces going in yeah so you get an infection
02:19:12.24 --> 02:19:15.60 and you're worried like you're gonna get sent home but it turns out they don't they don't
02:19:15.60 --> 02:19:23.68 sent you on yeah go ahead no yeah my team you know when we got back you know i basically i
02:19:23.68 --> 02:19:28.64 had to tell our delta you know because it was bad he's man you need to go to calf and then when i
02:19:28.64 --> 02:19:34.24 got the calf they basically said they're like okay you're done in the panjoy we need to monitor you
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.52 we don't you know we're not sure if you're gonna read a boy back to the states or not
02:19:39.52 --> 02:19:45.12 i knew if i read a boy back to the states that was a death wish as in and i don't mean literally but
02:19:45.12 --> 02:19:50.32 as in the command will know that this gamble that they took the let me go back to war
02:19:51.04 --> 02:19:57.44 it didn't pay off and i would never see combat again and so i i found work
02:19:57.44 --> 02:20:04.56 um i carried heavy shit and i made myself an important part of that and this was the first time
02:20:04.56 --> 02:20:12.08 in my life and so again it sounds really weird but stepping in this you know knee deep or i'm
02:20:12.08 --> 02:20:20.56 sorry calf deep and human feces led up to the first time in my life instead of saying poor
02:20:20.56 --> 02:20:26.32 me this happened to me why did i jump in that one trench and everything like that i owned it and i
02:20:26.32 --> 02:20:31.60 went and i found work and i and i made myself this valuable asset on calf load and helicopters
02:20:31.60 --> 02:20:38.48 to send supplies out to the guys in the field you know and still in combat and i i made you know
02:20:38.48 --> 02:20:43.84 made a name for myself is always getting these guys as if they needed one like that so i found work
02:20:43.84 --> 02:20:50.72 and then that was the first time that like that was a major victory for me of taking control
02:20:50.72 --> 02:20:57.92 over something that i very easily in the past what a straight went into victimization so
02:20:58.80 --> 02:21:03.68 so that here how long you doing that job for um i was doing that for
02:21:05.36 --> 02:21:12.80 probably the last three months of the deployment um and then you do you end up healing up
02:21:12.80 --> 02:21:19.76 decently and there's one more there's there ends up being a mission and the mission is is uh
02:21:19.76 --> 02:21:23.52 to go set up there's a big mission going on but you're gonna go with the command element you're
02:21:23.52 --> 02:21:28.32 gonna set up a command post on the top of a hill and that means you're gonna get inserted and
02:21:28.32 --> 02:21:35.60 you're gonna have to walk two kilometers but with three thousand feet of elevation gain and it's
02:21:35.60 --> 02:21:40.40 it's a it's a tough mission it's physically tough mission you you have some other strap hangers
02:21:40.40 --> 02:21:44.32 with you one of those guys wants to quit one of the other guys you guys end up having to carry
02:21:44.32 --> 02:21:52.24 other people's gear on that but you do it yeah you do it you do a good job you're healed up
02:21:52.88 --> 02:21:59.60 and luckily on the mission you know it's a it's a relatively peaceful mission yeah we we were
02:21:59.60 --> 02:22:06.000 supporting so the the seals and a bunch of ODA's we were clearing this valley together it was a joint
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.24 mission and um and the command element last mission of the deployment command element wants to get
02:22:12.24 --> 02:22:18.80 you know boots on the ground say they did some and so yeah we yeah we were going up to hilltop
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:26.96 2000 and guys you know one guy he just flat out I mean it's already but quit and that's like I
02:22:26.96 --> 02:22:32.000 didn't think you can do that in combat yeah this is not training bro there's no training time out here
02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.32 and then another guy is body just failed him and so we were whole we were carrying all this stuff
02:22:36.32 --> 02:22:42.96 up to the top but I'm not big on spotlight range your kind of stuff but I knew for sure
02:22:42.96 --> 02:22:50.32 that I could solidify my career as a green beret if the kernel and the command sergeant major
02:22:50.32 --> 02:22:57.36 all saw me as a beast even though my body was oh that's that was another time when I learned like
02:22:57.36 --> 02:23:04.16 your mind quits way before your body will way before your body will and if you have if you
02:23:04.16 --> 02:23:10.88 you put this drive you you have this goal you want to reach and that goal is more important to you
02:23:10.88 --> 02:23:19.12 then your mind um given up on you then you will be able to see how much further you can actually
02:23:19.12 --> 02:23:24.88 go once your mind is told you you're done yeah I sometimes people like what do you do and you get
02:23:24.88 --> 02:23:29.44 what do you tell yourself when you don't want to do something and I'm like I don't tell myself
02:23:29.44 --> 02:23:32.80 anything because my mind is the one I'm just gonna I'm gonna be gonna keep you what I'm doing
02:23:32.80 --> 02:23:36.80 but like I don't have these negotiations with myself about like well you should really
02:23:36.80 --> 02:23:44.08 not like shut up keep going there's the answer yeah and it's it's hard until you make it a lifestyle
02:23:44.08 --> 02:23:50.16 yeah yeah that's the positive lifestyle we're looking for you get done with that mission
02:23:51.20 --> 02:23:54.88 you know you're a little while later you go back to America when you get back to America
02:23:54.88 --> 02:24:01.28 you're actually going to the normal seventh group rotation which seventh group's ayo
02:24:01.28 --> 02:24:07.52 is South America yep South Central America South Central America so you end up doing some
02:24:08.48 --> 02:24:12.88 do you call them deployments if they're if they're short what do you call those um so we we have
02:24:12.88 --> 02:24:21.44 CNTs or um J sets and I know seals you guys do J sets also yep you also do CNTs the counter
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:26.96 in our cottage yeah okay so it's the same thing because we um I remember all of my deployments
02:24:26.96 --> 02:24:33.60 South Central America there was always um uh seal Patuens there so so you do some of those
02:24:33.60 --> 02:24:41.28 shorter trips and you go to L-SAL you go to Columbia you go to Peru and then I think you were
02:24:41.28 --> 02:24:50.96 getting ready to deploy to Guatemala and all of a sudden things change yeah they had um they
02:24:50.96 --> 02:24:57.28 requested it so Bravo Company second battalion was heading back to Afghanistan short on guys and
02:24:58.24 --> 02:25:04.40 so I saw I saw my in right there and I I started creating you know ways of finding my way over
02:25:04.40 --> 02:25:11.76 to Afghanistan somehow and that was that was all it took was I just I gave them the sales pitch
02:25:11.76 --> 02:25:15.68 and the original answer to your sales pitch was cool you can come but you're going to be
02:25:15.68 --> 02:25:24.32 not you know not not uh shooter yeah I was going to be riding a desk in managing um um uh
02:25:25.28 --> 02:25:32.80 just sources right right um so you so you're doing that that's your plan is to go over there
02:25:33.60 --> 02:25:42.56 you show up and uh about a month after you're there you get approached by the ops sergeant
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:45.68 who says a new mission just got dropped in our laps you want to piece the action
02:25:47.44 --> 02:25:53.44 and uh you say yep and so you guys start planning this mission uh going to the book here the
02:25:53.44 --> 02:25:57.92 way we drew things up the Taliban would see the Afghan commandos heading into the village and fire
02:25:57.92 --> 02:26:02.08 at them knowing for certain that the Afghan soldiers would turn and run away like they had many
02:26:02.08 --> 02:26:07.36 times before once a bunch of Taliban assholes started shooting however that would be all we needed
02:26:07.36 --> 02:26:11.92 to call in close air support assets overhead which would give the Taliban a healthy taste of
02:26:11.92 --> 02:26:16.64 American firepower the insurgents would know in a New York minute that the Americans were in the
02:26:16.64 --> 02:26:22.88 fight and that would change the battlefield in a hurry and then you say on paper everything
02:26:22.88 --> 02:26:30.000 red well and I put a nice little exclamation point by that because as we know things that look
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:37.84 good on paper don't always turn out the way you expect them to you proceed into this I'm going
02:26:37.84 --> 02:26:44.64 to fast forward a little bit um you're you're now executing the mission I could see our first target
02:26:44.64 --> 02:26:50.64 compound which was about a hundred meters up the path still had a long distance to clear and again
02:26:50.64 --> 02:26:54.32 this is after you you insert on the mission and we get done plan the mission you go
02:26:54.32 --> 02:26:58.000 insert on the mission you're moving you're moving to this first area that you're going to clear
02:26:59.28 --> 02:27:05.68 and the path started in narrow and rows of dormant fruit trees swallowed up the ground as we
02:27:05.68 --> 02:27:10.64 patrol deeper into the orchard I reminded myself to concentrate on significant details that were
02:27:10.64 --> 02:27:16.96 almost impossible to see under night vision and then pop with the fuck was that we all hit the ground
02:27:16.96 --> 02:27:21.44 unsure of the loud snap we just heard was a gunshot snipers in the area we waited for a shit storm
02:27:21.44 --> 02:27:26.96 of bullets to rain down on us but nothing happened then I noticed that jaw weed is that right
02:27:26.96 --> 02:27:34.08 yep Joey jaw weed and I were tangled in some type of line almost like fishing line holy shit
02:27:34.08 --> 02:27:41.68 we had hit a trip wire i.e. that didn't explode how did I miss that as jaw weed carefully
02:27:41.68 --> 02:27:45.44 investigated a trip wire against his chest without any quick movements I determined that the
02:27:45.44 --> 02:27:51.04 Taliban had tied the wire that ran from the set of explosives in in a mud wall all the way to a
02:27:51.04 --> 02:27:56.24 tree on the opposite side of the path the wire had been tied at chest level not the usual ankle
02:27:56.24 --> 02:28:01.44 height a clever move on the Taliban's part they knew we would be looking at our detectors to clear
02:28:01.44 --> 02:28:07.36 which meant we would be looking down at the dirt and walk right into a chest level trip wire
02:28:07.36 --> 02:28:12.56 why didn't the i.e. go off the best exclamation I could come up with was that the when the
02:28:12.56 --> 02:28:16.32 Overwatch element laid waste for five minutes firing everything they had into the orchard
02:28:16.32 --> 02:28:21.04 fragmentation from one of the mortars had hit the i.e. in disavvled it luck was on our side so
02:28:21.84 --> 02:28:26.80 there you go you're walking through this freaking orchard you hit a trip wire and for whatever
02:28:26.80 --> 02:28:32.40 reason probably the the preparatory fire that had been fired by your team had disrupt the
02:28:32.40 --> 02:28:40.16 die. we had cleared another 15 meters of path when I saw movement in an open field near the
02:28:40.16 --> 02:28:46.80 first compound I turned to Abe and Abe is one of your guys that you had with you one of your
02:28:46.80 --> 02:28:51.36 one of your afghans that you had with you and that was when it all hell broke out
02:28:51.36 --> 02:28:58.08 before Abe could respond the night was lit up by a barrage of gunfire coming from the compounds
02:28:58.08 --> 02:29:03.12 outer wall first it was a zip zip zip followed by the crack of 762 caliber rounds flying past our
02:29:03.12 --> 02:29:08.64 heads these rounds which rip holes in the darkness looked like a laser light show with tracer
02:29:08.64 --> 02:29:13.68 streaking across the night sky next came an explosion from an RPG being fired at us then more
02:29:13.68 --> 02:29:18.80 automatic fire we'd walk directly into an ambush shit with my heart beating out of my chest I hit
02:29:18.80 --> 02:29:24.40 the ground and started returning fire the Taliban the Taliban had set up a complex ambush
02:29:24.40 --> 02:29:28.80 ambush and the trip wire IED was supposed to start the whole thing off one of their pk
02:29:28.80 --> 02:29:33.68 machine guns let out a burst of 20 meters a burst of fire 20 meters from our position
02:29:33.68 --> 02:29:37.76 a distance so close that it was almost like I could grab the flame coming out of the end of the
02:29:37.76 --> 02:29:44.96 barrel jawede Abe and booze molla how do you say that best bezzmula bismula jump into the ditch
02:29:44.96 --> 02:29:52.16 well cahan con con okay just con well con darted back and took cover behind a tree
02:29:53.36 --> 02:29:58.96 I hit the deck and lay as flat as I could in the middle of the dirt path bullets kicked up and rock
02:29:58.96 --> 02:30:03.20 and gravel fragments all around me stinging my skin when bullets hit the ground around me
02:30:03.20 --> 02:30:08.24 splintering fragments sprayed everywhere I could tell some fragments struck my body armor's
02:30:08.24 --> 02:30:14.40 protective plate I was engaged I engaged the flames figuring that where there were flames there
02:30:14.40 --> 02:30:21.84 was a gun and where there was an AK 47 there was a fighter Ryan your strobe light my buddy Zach
02:30:21.84 --> 02:30:29.68 yelled over the radio they have NVGs they can see your strobe damn bro what were you thinking
02:30:29.68 --> 02:30:37.76 when you heard that I need to get this off comment I need to get this I are strobe away from me
02:30:37.76 --> 02:30:45.36 and our jatac couldn't see me because we had got caught up in an L shaped ambush and so he wasn't
02:30:45.36 --> 02:30:51.68 sure where the pkm was and that's you know so I took it off my helmet and I threw it as close as I
02:30:51.68 --> 02:30:57.60 could to where that pkm was at and then just hit the deck again and started engaging muzzle flashes
02:30:57.60 --> 02:31:03.20 and the jatac went you through the IR could he see it could the jatac see it so it's kind of funny
02:31:03.20 --> 02:31:09.60 um so I said you know you guys have visual on the IR and yeah and go okay they're they're over
02:31:09.60 --> 02:31:21.28 that direction he goes what in a while so uh going back here there's one guy that starts peeking out
02:31:23.04 --> 02:31:27.76 and you you actually end up killing this guy the third time he came out he took more time
02:31:27.76 --> 02:31:32.08 when the previous two tries attempting to a better shot off at us it was like he was daring
02:31:32.08 --> 02:31:37.52 me to light his ass up I knew I had him I locked in with a clear shot and let go a 10 to 15 round
02:31:37.52 --> 02:31:42.40 burst from my him for I watched him drop his body lay still on the ground it felt good to kill him
02:31:42.40 --> 02:31:47.20 but I couldn't relish the moment too long we were still pinned down our main element which was about
02:31:47.20 --> 02:31:52.64 25 to 30 meters behind our position put as much fire power on the enemy as they could hoping to keep
02:31:52.64 --> 02:31:58.40 their heads down long enough for US aircraft to start dropping bombs I knew from the many fights I'd been
02:31:58.40 --> 02:32:03.84 in before in this country that a call for air support had been made within seconds of their attack
02:32:03.84 --> 02:32:09.20 in the meantime Frankie's position let loose this one of your other teammates but the Taliban
02:32:09.20 --> 02:32:14.64 were well protected behind mud walls unless they stepped out the open like the guy with the Rpg launcher
02:32:14.64 --> 02:32:20.000 there wasn't much we could do without an air strike at the same time I was aware given how close
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:26.56 we were to the enemy that being killed by friendly fire was a very real worry yeah
02:32:26.56 --> 02:32:36.32 so you're you're 15 to 20 meters away from these bad guys yes the first peak and just so anyone that's
02:32:36.32 --> 02:32:42.32 wondering 15 to 20 meters is not a long way you know when you're gonna try and drop bombs
02:32:43.44 --> 02:32:50.64 yeah there's danger close and then there's common in on your position and it's yeah it's a little dicey
02:32:50.64 --> 02:32:57.68 this is getting a lot dicey yeah as our situation deteriorated by the second I knew that without
02:32:57.68 --> 02:33:07.60 bombs on target Jawede Abe Bismula Khan and I would all die this was about to turn into a body
02:33:07.60 --> 02:33:13.12 recovery mission and it would be our bodies that would be that they would be taking home within a
02:33:13.12 --> 02:33:18.96 couple of minutes the decision was made for us when our Air Force J-Tak J-Tak called in a
02:33:18.96 --> 02:33:25.76 500-pound bomb just 20 meters from my position this was considered a danger close strike I don't
02:33:25.76 --> 02:33:31.12 even know if that's considered danger that's that's called on my position yeah especially five
02:33:31.12 --> 02:33:36.56 hundred pounds hmm this was considered a danger close strike but one that would give us a
02:33:36.56 --> 02:33:40.96 fighting chance of making it out of the orchard alive they call it went out over the radio and then I
02:33:40.96 --> 02:33:47.04 heard Air Force J-Tak's voice in my earpiece Ryan were dropping close to you man keep your
02:33:47.04 --> 02:33:52.88 fucking head down after receiving the radio transmission I relayed the information to Abe who told
02:33:52.88 --> 02:33:56.96 the others to get as low as they could there wasn't enough room in the ditch so I grabbed Khan
02:33:56.96 --> 02:34:00.56 and pushed him into the trench while I stayed on the footpath I ordered them to hunker down
02:34:00.56 --> 02:34:04.96 or prepare for the blast since we weren't firing back at the enemy the volume of fire on our
02:34:04.96 --> 02:34:09.36 position picked up so now you guys are gongering down because you're expecting this bomb and now
02:34:09.36 --> 02:34:15.76 this the enemy's thinking they got an upper hand overhead I could hear the rocket motors of the
02:34:15.76 --> 02:34:22.24 F-16 ripping through the sky as the fighter jet came in bound I received one last warning over the
02:34:22.24 --> 02:34:28.000 radio bombs away man stay low I lay as flat as I could on the path holding my hands over my head
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.80 and planting my face in the dirt then I slightly tilted my head and opened my mouth to give the
02:34:32.80 --> 02:34:38.56 over pressure or shockwave a place to exit all I could do is wait for the blast when the bomb hit
02:34:38.56 --> 02:34:44.16 the over pressure from the explosion sent grass dirt gravel dust and tree branches flying in
02:34:44.16 --> 02:34:49.20 our direction I waited for the big chunks of mud of the mud compound to land on me as well as
02:34:49.20 --> 02:34:54.08 bits of earth another debris thankfully I was spared from the hunk some mud wall heating me
02:34:54.08 --> 02:34:58.72 which would have broken my back instead I was covered with dirt leaves and branches but the
02:34:58.72 --> 02:35:03.28 concussive force was so great that I felt like my skeleton had just walked out of my body
02:35:03.28 --> 02:35:08.80 turned slap me in the face and re-entered my body I tried to stand up I kept falling
02:35:08.80 --> 02:35:15.92 I almost felt like I was drunk yeah a few of a 500 pound bond go off freaking your rocked yeah
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:20.64 it's like you just got like when you see someone get knocked out in the in in the UFC
02:35:21.20 --> 02:35:26.64 that's what you just got hit with. Yep only not just to the jaw but to the entire body
02:35:28.08 --> 02:35:32.16 in all my time in Afghanistan I'd get to experience a concussive explosion of that magnitude
02:35:32.16 --> 02:35:36.24 it took a good minute to regain my senses just as I was figuring out what happened I heard
02:35:36.24 --> 02:35:41.12 my guy screaming over the radio Ryan are you good Ryan answer your fucking radio if you're alive
02:35:41.84 --> 02:35:46.08 their voices sounded like someone is yelling down a long tunnel trying to get my attention I got my
02:35:46.08 --> 02:35:52.08 bearings fuck that was good that was big big but I'm good man I answered I couldn't believe what
02:35:52.08 --> 02:35:58.56 it just happened how big of a bomb was that 500 pounds brother used a big one man and I'm still alive
02:35:59.76 --> 02:36:04.32 I thought I had come away without a scratch until I felt warm liquid coming out of my ears
02:36:04.32 --> 02:36:10.64 from the monstrous blast damn that was close there was no time to worry about my the ear drip
02:36:10.64 --> 02:36:15.36 because I had no idea if the enemy was still moving around or all tapped out I took a moment to
02:36:15.36 --> 02:36:20.000 shake the cobwebs out of my head then I checked on my guys to ensure they were good after everyone
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.60 was accounted for un-injured I had my guys fall back to the closest position which was 20 meters behind us
02:36:25.60 --> 02:36:30.88 once we were back with the main element our jatac called in another strike which would ensure that
02:36:30.88 --> 02:36:44.08 if anyone was still moving in the compound they were sure to be dead damn that's uh that's freaking
02:36:44.08 --> 02:36:51.20 psycho crazy right there dropping a 500 pound bomb at 20 meters like I said that's I mean we'll have
02:36:51.20 --> 02:36:59.36 to ask a good deal Dave Burke and see what the you know what what the error box is on that yeah
02:36:59.36 --> 02:37:05.04 you know I will re-oj attack I was a jac and like 20 meters is tight
02:37:06.88 --> 02:37:10.88 that's a tight one but they do it that's what they do you know they got GPS guided
02:37:10.88 --> 02:37:16.56 musicians and they do they do drop right in a spot yeah they actually had to switch out aircraft
02:37:16.56 --> 02:37:24.72 or switch out platforms to drop a non-fragmentation producing like a concuss because of how close we
02:37:24.72 --> 02:37:30.96 were and it it took like five minutes to get bombs on target and anyone who's been in a tick before
02:37:30.96 --> 02:37:36.96 five minutes yeah really long time well salute to your jac because that's a balls you call right there
02:37:36.96 --> 02:37:42.40 yep he's a freaking legit yeah I remember him saying he's like man if I if I would have killed
02:37:42.40 --> 02:37:51.60 you my career's done I was like thank you don't worry about your bro yeah yeah the deed the
02:37:51.60 --> 02:37:58.000 deeds that amazing same my life oh yeah for sure that's crazy you know that's when I was a
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.72 jac they would when you had to call danger close you have to give your initials I don't know if
02:38:02.72 --> 02:38:08.72 they still do this but you have to give your initials saying like I'm signing for this bomb this
02:38:08.72 --> 02:38:13.04 is on me and you need to drop this bomb and you like they would be off that to get with you
02:38:13.04 --> 02:38:19.44 a jac initials or something I forget the actual calls but the MC Juliet whiskey drop it in
02:38:19.44 --> 02:38:28.56 boom so you now you go you you go you clear this compound the sun started to come up
02:38:29.68 --> 02:38:35.28 it's kind of settled down the situations kind of settled down a little bit the sun started to come
02:38:35.28 --> 02:38:44.64 up you're feeling good about that because now it makes ideas easier to find then you start moving
02:38:44.64 --> 02:38:52.000 to another compound and and once again you're just like finding ideas trippy ideas and still just
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:58.80 moving from compound to compound clearing more ideas as you enter these other compounds there's
02:38:58.80 --> 02:39:03.20 there's not any movement or anything you say during the rest of our clearance I encountered
02:39:03.20 --> 02:39:10.56 more than 20 ideas hmm I personally blew up 15 before I ran out of c4 explosives we marked the
02:39:10.56 --> 02:39:20.000 rest um overall we located more than 50 ideas 470 170 millimeter rockets multiple booby traps
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.44 and a complex bunker and tunnel system this particular part of the village lived up to its
02:39:25.44 --> 02:39:30.80 reputation as a hotbed for Taliban fighters the Taliban had reinforced bunkers spread throughout
02:39:30.80 --> 02:39:40.40 the village many connecting with tunnels that's freaking psycho I mean runnin into
02:39:40.40 --> 02:39:48.16 50 ideas during the mall yeah it's um yeah the ones we couldn't clear we just had to mark and bypass
02:39:48.16 --> 02:39:54.80 it was yeah that village was a super nasty super nasty so then there's this little
02:39:56.32 --> 02:40:02.32 discussion between the Afghan force leader who after you guys clear these places
02:40:02.32 --> 02:40:11.04 your the goal is hey the Afghan stay there to you know prohibit the Taliban from coming in and
02:40:11.04 --> 02:40:16.88 taking over so there's a little bit of a discussion because you know American forces are going to leave
02:40:16.88 --> 02:40:22.72 okay we did the hard part and cleared everything now you stay there and occupy and build defenses
02:40:22.72 --> 02:40:28.000 and set up claimors and you know secure the area and hold onto it well they don't want to do that
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:35.44 and so this discussion is happening and while this discussion is happening which by the way
02:40:35.44 --> 02:40:41.44 your team leader says the Afghan says the American should say not my Afghan soldiers you're
02:40:41.44 --> 02:40:46.08 better equipped to fight the Taliban and the team leader says if this was Texas I would agree with you
02:40:46.08 --> 02:40:50.48 but we're in Afghanistan this is your country I'm here to help you but not when your battles
02:40:52.08 --> 02:40:57.60 so as this little discussion's going on one year Afghan one of the Afghan commandos comes up to you
02:40:57.60 --> 02:41:03.44 and with with the interpreter and says there's 15 to 20 men moving our way yep and
02:41:04.80 --> 02:41:10.96 you know the discussions still going on a few seconds later the Afghan commandos tugged on my
02:41:10.96 --> 02:41:16.08 shirt sleeve to get my attention again the men are heading this way we need to do something
02:41:16.08 --> 02:41:20.56 because I don't think these are villagers from the area he said I went back to my team sergeant
02:41:20.56 --> 02:41:24.80 was more direct we need to get out of here we have fighting age males moving in our direction
02:41:24.80 --> 02:41:28.88 I'm grabbing my guys and getting into positions to move out the team sergeant not not it
02:41:28.88 --> 02:41:33.68 fuck this he said I'm done to go she ate with these guys let's move out he had barely finished
02:41:33.68 --> 02:41:39.92 this sentence when the first shot was by my head with the all two familiar zip followed by a crack
02:41:41.04 --> 02:41:44.64 we were immediately in the fight for our lives
02:41:47.92 --> 02:41:49.20 rounds were coming in all round
02:41:49.20 --> 02:41:56.56 from automatic machine gunfire series of RPG explosions took us by total surprise
02:41:56.56 --> 02:42:00.24 everything turned into total chaos in an instant everything was happening so fast it was
02:42:00.24 --> 02:42:04.88 impossible for the human brain to comprehend it instinctively I knew I was sprinting for cover
02:42:04.88 --> 02:42:10.72 but for a split second I felt frozen in pandemonium of everything happening around me
02:42:10.72 --> 02:42:16.08 while my brain scrambled to make sense of the attacks ferocity now I was moving quickly
02:42:16.08 --> 02:42:20.80 screaming instructions and returning fired an enemy I could not see round sprayed everywhere hitting
02:42:20.80 --> 02:42:26.000 compound walls like a garden hose watering down a dusty road just then I heard a grunt as if you
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.08 was hurt that was that's one of your afghans but for some reason it didn't occur to me that he
02:42:30.08 --> 02:42:34.96 could have been hit I darted toward a ditch that paralleled the dirt road running through the village
02:42:34.96 --> 02:42:40.24 after diving for cover I peered out cautiously but I couldn't see any of my guys or where we were
02:42:40.24 --> 02:42:46.88 taking fire from bullets were telling up dirt all around me as we tried to stay as low as possible
02:42:46.88 --> 02:42:51.28 then I noticed that three commandos in the ditch ten meters from my position had drawn the
02:42:51.28 --> 02:42:56.48 attention of a towel band machine gun crew that had zeroed in on them I waved for the three afghans
02:42:56.48 --> 02:43:00.96 to move to my position which would give them more cover but they were too scared to move I knew that
02:43:00.96 --> 02:43:05.68 if they didn't get their asses in gear and start moving they were gonna die I don't know what possessed
02:43:05.68 --> 02:43:09.60 me but I climbed out from my ditch and sprinted to their position praying to God that my
02:43:09.60 --> 02:43:15.04 adaptive leg would hold up I reached the first commando and grabbed the very first thing that I could
02:43:15.04 --> 02:43:20.48 get a hold of his hair I yanked him out up and pulled him back to my ditch holding the other two
02:43:20.48 --> 02:43:26.72 would follow they did as we ran dust kicked up and more rounds impacted around us I slid into the ditch
02:43:26.72 --> 02:43:31.52 like I was licking out a triple then I reached back and dragged the three scared shit let's
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:36.08 commandos down with me we had company in this part of the ditch Frankie was providing aid to another
02:43:36.08 --> 02:43:41.36 wounded afghan Frankie you okay man I'm good brother how about you yeah I'm okay you see aber
02:43:41.36 --> 02:43:47.36 anyone else not yet man I moved closer to a small mud wall that paralleled the ditch this wall
02:43:47.36 --> 02:43:51.68 provided decent protection from enemy fire and allowed me to look down the dirt road where I saw
02:43:51.68 --> 02:43:58.08 an afghan soldier lying motionless I brought up my rifle scope to get a better look Frankie I
02:43:58.08 --> 02:44:04.000 think that's buzmula in the middle of the road bro I think he's dead my heart jumped straight to my
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.48 throat one of our guys was killed fuck where's the rest of my team Frankie and I were the only two
02:44:08.48 --> 02:44:15.36 Americans in that ditch I scanned back down the road where vizmula lay I knew a was next to him
02:44:15.36 --> 02:44:24.24 before the ambush kicked off but I could only see bizmula I hoped abe wasn't hit to what I could
02:44:24.24 --> 02:44:31.20 determine was that we had two wounded afghan commandos and bizmula lying in the middle of the road
02:44:31.20 --> 02:44:36.08 I figured bizmula was dead but until I had my hands on him I couldn't be a hundred percent sure
02:44:36.80 --> 02:44:41.28 I knew I needed to get to him but the amount of life fire coming in was too heavy
02:44:41.92 --> 02:44:47.52 the radio crackled again and then I heard a heart stomping message in my headset loud and clear
02:44:49.12 --> 02:44:51.12 Eagles down Eagles down
02:44:52.96 --> 02:44:59.60 The phrase Eagles down was code for Americans wounded or killed the fight had just taken the worst possible turn
02:44:59.60 --> 02:45:08.08 There were Americans wounded or killed somewhere on the battlefield but I didn't know where we needed some air support in a hurry
02:45:13.36 --> 02:45:18.000 How much time has passed and when I just read and I skipped a little bit of stuff but this is all
02:45:18.72 --> 02:45:28.32 I remember few minutes now I remember we were basically screaming for air support and they couldn't because the
02:45:28.32 --> 02:45:29.68 Taliban
02:45:29.68 --> 02:45:35.20 With the tunnel systems they were in our lines and they couldn't drop because they couldn't distinguish who was who
02:45:35.92 --> 02:45:39.36 And so yeah, if he came a fist fight at that point
02:45:44.16 --> 02:45:48.80 Here's the understatement of the year coming from you back to the book bro this shit is bad
02:45:49.68 --> 02:45:54.64 I said to Frankie no sooner did the words leave my lips than I heard one sound that gives every green
02:45:54.64 --> 02:46:00.72 Break chills and explosion from a morgue around which landed 30 meters from us and shook the earth
02:46:01.76 --> 02:46:06.40 I hit the ground and turned toward Frankie shit. I yelled they got a mortar tube up
02:46:06.88 --> 02:46:11.76 We need to move before we get hit so for anyone that doesn't know anything about mortars
02:46:13.52 --> 02:46:20.08 When you shoot mortars you don't hit what you're aiming at on the first shot usually you have to do something called bracketing
02:46:20.08 --> 02:46:25.68 Which means you fire your first shot and oh it goes long so you back your distance off a little bit
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:31.68 You fire your next shot. It's probably gonna be short and then you split the difference and your neck shots are on target
02:46:31.68 --> 02:46:36.88 So when you're getting more dirt if you sit there they're gonna bracket you. They're gonna find you and they're gonna get you
02:46:40.64 --> 02:46:46.72 Gun fire is one thing if the enemy is close enough to shoot at you. He's close and you're close enough to kill him mortars are different
02:46:46.72 --> 02:46:53.28 They can be two or three kilometers away and engage you with Debbie fire and by the time you figure out where they're coming from
02:46:53.28 --> 02:46:58.16 It's too late another explosion hit the compound to the left of us two close for comfort
02:46:58.40 --> 02:47:00.88 That was our cue time to make a move
02:47:01.04 --> 02:47:05.76 Frankie and I engage Talbot targets as much as possible trying to keep their heads down with return fire
02:47:05.92 --> 02:47:09.28 Which would give us a little time to pick up our wounded afghans and move back
02:47:09.76 --> 02:47:15.60 Crack around hit directly in the wall above my head crack another round two close for comfort crack and another one
02:47:15.60 --> 02:47:21.84 Then two more rounds hit the mud wall in front of us a sniper had our position dialed in every time we stuck our heads up
02:47:21.84 --> 02:47:26.96 He sent rounds our way to make matters worse the Taliban were dropping mortars closer and closer to our position
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:36.000 One of the afghan commandos besides us spoke a little English. He pointed to his radio and said he heard the Taliban had our position and we're trying to capture us
02:47:38.08 --> 02:47:44.32 Hearing that word struck fear in my heart. I'd nudged Frankie again the Taliban are trying to flank us and cut us off in the restaurant
02:47:44.32 --> 02:47:47.44 Our guys so they can take us it's time to move brother. I shouted
02:47:48.72 --> 02:47:54.88 First things first how do we avoid getting shot by the sniper? I saw protected area near a compound a couple of hundred meters from us
02:47:54.96 --> 02:48:00.40 Where I recognized several Americans including our medic Joe Frankie I see Joe. Let's move to him
02:48:03.28 --> 02:48:05.28 So you guys gather everyone up
02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:07.28 And you
02:48:07.28 --> 02:48:13.44 Finally like are able to get over to this other position where Joe is
02:48:13.44 --> 02:48:15.44 Joe's your medic. He's working on guys
02:48:16.72 --> 02:48:21.52 You get their all blood moons and cries for help stay to shock could be seen on the commandos faces
02:48:21.52 --> 02:48:23.52 We knew we were in a real shit storm
02:48:23.68 --> 02:48:28.32 So far we had one dead afghan commando two wounded afghans three wounded Americans
02:48:29.12 --> 02:48:31.12 We were missing five afghans
02:48:31.36 --> 02:48:34.56 Including Abe and Bismula who are your two guys
02:48:34.56 --> 02:48:36.56 Yes
02:48:42.56 --> 02:48:44.56 And still no air support
02:48:44.56 --> 02:48:48.56 At that point in time once we were able to get back to the CCP
02:48:49.12 --> 02:48:51.12 Well the first CCP
02:48:51.52 --> 02:48:57.36 We were able to start dropping bombs on on the targets probably 45 minutes into the tick and then
02:48:58.32 --> 02:49:03.92 They came up about a tunnels and engaged us at that first CCP which means we had to find another CCP
02:49:03.92 --> 02:49:05.92 How are you doing for ammo
02:49:06.48 --> 02:49:08.48 We're handing mags off
02:49:13.52 --> 02:49:20.24 So you're in this first casualty collection point CCP so for those of you who don't know this is when you're in a bad situation
02:49:20.24 --> 02:49:24.08 And you've got casualties you want to get to a point where you can gather all the casualties together
02:49:24.48 --> 02:49:29.36 So you can number one provide security number two provide medical attention and the number three
02:49:29.36 --> 02:49:34.40 Trying to figure out where you're tactically can get them out of there. Mm-hmm
02:49:35.68 --> 02:49:41.76 So you're in this CCP. I looked around for a jawede and con jawede was sitting up against a wall trying to catch his breath
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.76 Grabbing ghost aren't turperder. I asked him if you knew where Abe was jawede shook his head. No, I haven't seen Abe
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:54.16 Just then I saw Frankie con and two afghan commandos carrying Bismula from the road to the CCP
02:49:54.16 --> 02:50:00.32 Bismula's alive, but he can't feel his legs Frankie said thank God we got biz, but where's Abe? I asked
02:50:00.88 --> 02:50:05.68 A puzzle look came over Frankie no one has seen Abe since the firing started bro. He's still out there
02:50:11.84 --> 02:50:16.96 Fast forward a little bit now that we had most of our friendly forces back in one location our aircraft could start
02:50:17.20 --> 02:50:22.000 Engaging targets up first was the white two story former school building and these are things you explain
02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.16 These are areas where you're taken fire from um after 45 minutes of intense fighting we finally dropped our first bomb
02:50:29.04 --> 02:50:33.68 As they have 15 jet screamed across the sky and extremely close to our position the first bomb dropped
02:50:33.92 --> 02:50:38.96 The white building was reduced to wooden debris in a nanosecond instantly killing the sniper inside
02:50:40.88 --> 02:50:46.96 Fast forward a little bit at that point we had two wounded afghans three wounded Americans and now two dead afghan commandos
02:50:46.96 --> 02:50:55.68 300 meters to the right of the compound was another mud hot compound with tall walls for protection and a large open field big enough for helicopters to land in
02:50:56.48 --> 02:51:02.72 This was gonna have to work because we need to get going we picked up and quickly moved to our new location and started calling a dust off
02:51:02.72 --> 02:51:06.48 Which was our call sign our radio call sign for medical evacuation
02:51:07.12 --> 02:51:09.60 So now you move into this bigger compound and
02:51:11.52 --> 02:51:15.68 You're preparing to get helicopters in there to get the wounded and dead out of there
02:51:15.68 --> 02:51:21.44 You go over to Bismillah. I calmly asked him if he knew where Ab was
02:51:22.32 --> 02:51:29.60 Ab was next to me when we started fighting he said and then he jumped into the ditch near the foot bridge at the last compound
02:51:29.60 --> 02:51:30.96 We cleared
02:51:30.96 --> 02:51:39.76 Okay, now I had a starting point, but we couldn't move or go near that area of the village the enemy was too well dug in every time we poked our heads above the near
02:51:39.76 --> 02:51:46.80 Road we got lit up by the Taliban somehow I had to get Abe I was not leaving him behind
02:51:48.32 --> 02:51:55.12 I had an Afghan commando pointing to the foot bridge saying another commando was there with Abe that meant two wounded guys now
02:51:55.20 --> 02:52:01.36 Which also meant I would need more help our Air Force J tax said he had a plan to keep the Taliban's head down
02:52:01.44 --> 02:52:03.76 While we sprinted for the foot bridge
02:52:04.24 --> 02:52:09.60 I'll call the Apache's to fly in front of your movement and shoot the shit out of everything ahead of you
02:52:09.60 --> 02:52:11.60 Guys, I like the way that sounded
02:52:13.44 --> 02:52:15.44 Little cover move with the helicopters
02:52:17.52 --> 02:52:22.32 At the same time we were putting together our two minute game plan the team sergeant stopped us
02:52:22.32 --> 02:52:26.08 We can't risk you going down there to get those guys. He said too much enemy fire
02:52:26.80 --> 02:52:31.20 Well, we're not leaving them behind. I said my team sergeant wasn't happy with my answer
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:36.96 But he knew what we had to do. I spoke up again if we leave without them we could go we could have a mute knee on our hands with the Afghans
02:52:36.96 --> 02:52:39.36 We have to go no one gets left behind
02:52:41.44 --> 02:52:46.56 The team sergeant looked at us knowing this was something that must happen. Okay. We'll go he said
02:52:47.44 --> 02:52:50.08 This was going to be an American-led recovery operation
02:52:50.24 --> 02:52:55.28 Why the Afghan commandos wouldn't go recover their own guys was beyond me if an American had been left behind
02:52:55.28 --> 02:52:58.80 We would go to hellem back for our to get our brothers out dead or alive
02:52:59.44 --> 02:53:05.12 The J tack interrupted the discussion stating the Apache's were inbound to do a gun run on enemy positions
02:53:05.12 --> 02:53:08.48 We needed to use cover this cover as our chance to move
02:53:09.76 --> 02:53:13.76 Here they come everyone ready the J tack asked it was go time
02:53:16.40 --> 02:53:21.36 The sounds of the large caliber bullets echoed off the compound walls is the Apache's open fire
02:53:21.36 --> 02:53:23.60 Blanketing the area with 30 millimeter rounds
02:53:23.76 --> 02:53:28.80 Frankie our J tack our team sergeant and I sprinted down the road toward the area
02:53:28.88 --> 02:53:34.40 Where we assumed Abe in the mission missing commando were as we ran like hell in the direction of the foot bridge
02:53:34.40 --> 02:53:41.20 We took on small arms fire, but nothing compared to what it could have been if those Apache's weren't helping us
02:53:42.16 --> 02:53:46.88 The closer I got to the foot bridge though the more I prepared myself for what I might see
02:53:47.04 --> 02:53:51.44 Leading up to the bridge the terrain shifted upwards slightly making it hard to see what was in the ditch
02:53:51.44 --> 02:53:58.56 I was almost to the foot bridge when I looked down there float floating lifeless in the water at the bottom of the ditch was Abe
02:53:58.56 --> 02:54:07.12 His body was sprawled out with a blood soaked bandage around his pelvic area Abe had attempted to stop the bleeding himself
02:54:07.12 --> 02:54:11.92 But I knew that pelvic wounds were almost impossible to treat without proper medical help
02:54:13.20 --> 02:54:19.84 Abe had blood out so much that the muddy water in the ditch had turned bright red my friend was dead and I could not save him
02:54:19.84 --> 02:54:26.56 A Taliban sniper had perfectly placed three rounds into his pelvis. Oh Abe, they finally got you
02:54:31.12 --> 02:54:36.24 As I got to his body in the ditch, Frankie was providing covering fire while the team sergeant
02:54:36.24 --> 02:54:41.60 Nia attempted to pull Abe out lifting a lifeless body out of a six foot muddy ditch was especially difficult
02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.36 Adding to the difficulties was the fact that Abe's body was covered in blood
02:54:45.36 --> 02:54:52.40 Which made him extremely slippery to hold onto we couldn't get a good grip on him and struggled to carry his body up to dry ground
02:54:53.52 --> 02:55:00.000 I became more and more drenched in the Abe's blood and even got some of his blood in my mouth a taste that's forever etched in my mind
02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:14.24 Finally after giving it everything we had we freed Abe from his watery grave but the smells the tastes and everything about that moment still hauled me to this day
02:55:14.24 --> 02:55:35.04 Kind of kind of it's I mean not only does it say a lot about the American soldier in the American fighting man that you four go down to recover the body of these Afghans
02:55:35.04 --> 02:55:37.84 Also obviously says a lot about the Afghans who
02:55:37.84 --> 02:55:42.72 Don't go to go and recover their own people
02:55:45.04 --> 02:55:52.40 But that's you know to me it's a lot of it's just a cast to do with the value of human life that we have as Americans like we see we we value human life more
02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:01.76 And the bond that we have is so strong and it's just it's a it's a real tribute to
02:56:01.76 --> 02:56:10.000 The American soldier that you're you're going you're risking your life and your friends are risking your lives your lives as Americans to go and
02:56:11.28 --> 02:56:15.04 Basically you know that these guys are dead. I mean that's your suspicion
02:56:15.92 --> 02:56:20.96 Yeah, but you're still not gonna leave these guys behind knowing you're so happy
02:56:20.96 --> 02:56:35.68 You get you get Abe out of the trench and you you basically you find a ladder that that you use as a stretcher
02:56:35.68 --> 02:56:42.000 You put them on this thing on this ladder you carrying him into the compound as you're carrying them into the compound
02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.88 There's Afghans commandos that are just standing there watching you struggle
02:56:44.88 --> 02:56:51.04 We got back to the book don't just stand there fucking helpless. I screamed at the commandos
02:56:51.04 --> 02:56:55.52 But they stood there like statues. We continued on the landing zone to wait for the helicopter
02:56:56.72 --> 02:56:59.44 I was carrying I was helping carry get Abe
02:57:00.40 --> 02:57:06.08 Carried Abe on the makes shift gurney when I saw the helicopter hovering over it had finally hit me my buddy was really dead
02:57:06.32 --> 02:57:08.96 My heart sank when the helicopter touched down
02:57:08.96 --> 02:57:16.96 I helped load Abe onto the last flight you would ever take I reached out and grabbed his lifeless hand as the helicopter lifted off from the ground to take him away
02:57:18.88 --> 02:57:20.88 Yes, Abe was gone
02:57:20.88 --> 02:57:26.56 But we had recovered his body so that his family could give him a proper burial a true warriors funeral
02:57:27.44 --> 02:57:33.36 If the Taliban had recovered his body they would have desecrated it instead we did right by him
02:57:33.36 --> 02:57:42.72 As American fighting men and women we have one belief we will fight and die for no one gets left behind
02:57:57.60 --> 02:57:59.60 Yeah
02:57:59.60 --> 02:58:04.68 And you know in the book you go into a little bit about both Abe and
02:58:05.04 --> 02:58:14.56 This mula who you knew well and their backgrounds what kind of guys they were you know the the what they had fallen tiered to do right
02:58:15.76 --> 02:58:20.84 And you know like as I'm sitting here calling you crazy for want to go back and find I eds
02:58:21.60 --> 02:58:26.74 If you're if you're part of the Afghan team guess what guess how long you're deployment last forever
02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000 Right
02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:36.000 So these guys are out there hanging it out there and you know you had that bond with them and then you stayed true to that bond
02:58:41.20 --> 02:58:48.52 What was the what was the I mean you know obviously shortly after this you you end up getting the rest of the team out
02:58:49.96 --> 02:58:53.24 What was the total losses for that day?
02:58:53.24 --> 02:58:58.20 That day we ended up with four Americans WIA
02:58:58.76 --> 02:59:01.52 eight Afghans carry a and 12 Afghans
02:59:02.72 --> 02:59:04.72 So it was pretty bad day
02:59:05.76 --> 02:59:10.76 How big was the force going in we have conflicting reports the last report
02:59:10.76 --> 02:59:16.16 I remember seeing as we killed over 400 Taliban now air craft killed over 400 Taliban
02:59:16.16 --> 02:59:18.16 We you know personally probably
02:59:18.68 --> 02:59:22.56 You know 10 20 at small arms and but that's still a pretty big force
02:59:22.56 --> 02:59:28.80 But I'm over 400 how many guys did you have total how many Afghans how big was the Afghan command O unit?
02:59:29.32 --> 02:59:30.52 We
02:59:30.52 --> 02:59:36.32 100 and I think about a 120 Afghans and then an ODA and an ODB so
02:59:36.88 --> 02:59:40.68 About 25 Americans about 120 Afghans
02:59:45.04 --> 02:59:47.04 How how
02:59:47.04 --> 02:59:56.16 How much longer were you in country after that operation that it actually just started to deploy them off so we still had another
02:59:57.84 --> 03:00:02.96 I think I'd say five more months and what was the what was the rest of the point of like
03:00:03.84 --> 03:00:11.60 It was it was back to just trying to try to chase you know chase that elusive combat again, but
03:00:12.24 --> 03:00:15.80 Nothing nothing came even close to touching a
03:00:15.80 --> 03:00:22.20 Baglin and did they did they throw you back in because you you're original purpose on that deployment was more of work
03:00:22.20 --> 03:00:27.08 And the Intel side yep, did you get moved back into that and that's kind of what you spent most of the deployment
03:00:27.08 --> 03:00:34.56 Yes, I did yeah, I was I was moved back into the into the Intel role of it and I would um, you know
03:00:34.56 --> 03:00:37.88 I would constantly try and create work and find myself on missions and whatnot
03:00:37.88 --> 03:00:41.88 But yeah, I was back you know doing those reports
03:00:41.88 --> 03:00:45.88 I'm gonna fast forward a little bit
03:00:46.84 --> 03:00:48.84 To your head and home when our
03:00:49.84 --> 03:00:53.20 2016 tour due to his over into lie our team bordered a
03:00:53.84 --> 03:01:02.64 C17 at Bogramar field and flew west until we landed at Eglonair force base near Pensacola floor to falling a fuel stop at Ramstein air base in Germany
03:01:02.84 --> 03:01:05.92 We basically hop from the dangers of the Afghan
03:01:05.92 --> 03:01:12.36 And from from the dangers of Afghanistan to tranquil floored up within 24 hours the quickest I ever returned home
03:01:12.36 --> 03:01:15.56 I still had to afghanistan dirt underneath my fingernails
03:01:15.56 --> 03:01:18.60 I didn't realize that I had suffered traumatic brain injury
03:01:19.24 --> 03:01:24.28 During the firefight where the 500 pound bomb had landed just 17 meters from my position
03:01:26.92 --> 03:01:33.84 Binge drinking on weekends became the norm for me fast forward in a little bit including consumption of a lot of beer at home
03:01:33.84 --> 03:01:36.84 I could easily clear 12 to 15 millilights in an evening
03:01:39.84 --> 03:01:48.80 And you know you you again, it's really good because in this book you go through some of the details of what's happening when you come home from deployment
03:01:48.80 --> 03:01:50.000 you know
03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000 You have that kind of
03:01:53.56 --> 03:01:59.28 What is it little empty feeling that we get something like that and you're trying to fill it up you're trying to figure out
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:06.88 You know what this is how how to adjust back to being in Florida or wherever you're gonna be
03:02:08.40 --> 03:02:10.40 So you're doing
03:02:11.40 --> 03:02:19.32 You're doing the path which is easily available to us when we come home which is drinking fighting causing problems
03:02:22.28 --> 03:02:24.28 Little road rage activity
03:02:24.64 --> 03:02:28.32 You're with Dawn and are you married to Dawn at this point?
03:02:28.32 --> 03:02:36.64 No, we got married in 18. So you got your girlfriend Dawn and you're you're like driving and you're with Dawn
03:02:36.64 --> 03:02:40.52 And I'm gonna look here the dude suddenly turned into this is oh, yeah, he cuts you off
03:02:41.04 --> 03:02:45.12 Right driving and you get your road rage on and you follow him
03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:50.64 What kind of vehicle you driving? I was driving in Tundra. Okay, check
03:02:51.28 --> 03:02:55.68 So you're driving your Tundra this dude suddenly turned into a driveway and ran into the house
03:02:55.68 --> 03:02:58.88 I slid into the curb and put my truck and park
03:02:58.88 --> 03:03:03.04 I was about to run after him when Dawn grabbed my arm. What are you doing?
03:03:03.04 --> 03:03:08.08 She asked are you gonna chase him down beat him up and then what what if we've got guns in the house?
03:03:08.64 --> 03:03:10.32 What makes you think he doesn't have them?
03:03:10.32 --> 03:03:12.64 This is stupid. What's going on with you right now?
03:03:12.64 --> 03:03:18.04 She had a point. I let out a huge breath of air which dialed back the adrenaline surging through my body
03:03:18.04 --> 03:03:22.64 Fuck this I mumbled as I got back into the truck. I used away from the curb and turned home word
03:03:22.64 --> 03:03:27.28 For the next 10 minutes neither of us set a word my mind was locked on this thought
03:03:27.28 --> 03:03:32.20 You need to get your temper under control damn it. I was a green beret
03:03:32.20 --> 03:03:39.68 That man I was professional and flipping the switch between civilian life and being in a war zone was the professional thing to do
03:03:40.56 --> 03:03:47.88 Yet here I was acting like a bully if someone did something I didn't like I took some active measures over the next few days in weeks
03:03:47.88 --> 03:03:51.28 I opened up to my friend Mike Valke. How he says?
03:03:51.28 --> 03:03:56.88 Yeah, I opened up to my friend Mike Valke Tyler and Frankie about some of my struggles
03:03:56.88 --> 03:04:03.12 It turned out I wasn't alone after sharing my innermost thoughts with Frankie he said he was going through the same
03:04:03.52 --> 03:04:05.92 Issues is me finally someone gets it
03:04:07.12 --> 03:04:10.80 And this is where you started kind of getting control though nothing happened overnight
03:04:11.92 --> 03:04:16.32 I slowly got my shit under control my anger issues at times were still an open question
03:04:16.32 --> 03:04:21.36 But I started to focus on what triggered me which helped me ratchet my aggression way down
03:04:24.88 --> 03:04:30.24 Yeah, I kind of I kind of spoiler alerted on the on the marriage thing, but luckily
03:04:30.24 --> 03:04:35.04 I didn't spoil much because in a very romantic fashion and an apple bees parking lot
03:04:35.44 --> 03:04:37.44 You asked Dawn if she would marry you
03:04:41.04 --> 03:04:43.04 You got married
03:04:43.04 --> 03:04:45.04 um
03:04:45.04 --> 03:04:48.48 You get cleared to do another seven month appointment to
03:04:49.20 --> 03:04:53.60 Afghanistan in August of 2018 ends in March of 2019
03:04:56.24 --> 03:05:00.24 You say in the book here in a few words my last appointment to Afghanistan was boring and cold
03:05:01.84 --> 03:05:03.84 You you detail some of these missions
03:05:03.84 --> 03:05:08.40 You also say that boring has tons of upside for coming back with all your limbs which is good
03:05:08.40 --> 03:05:12.88 And you did make it home from that deployment
03:05:14.56 --> 03:05:16.56 With all your limbs, but
03:05:17.60 --> 03:05:22.40 And you did make it home and not and obviously as we know not everybody does and I want to close out this book
03:05:22.96 --> 03:05:24.96 You know you detail some more information and
03:05:26.72 --> 03:05:28.96 But I want to close out the book
03:05:31.44 --> 03:05:36.48 In the actually in the acknowledgments when you address the fact that not everyone comes home
03:05:36.48 --> 03:05:46.08 Then you say last I want to point out the men who epitomize heroic courage and whom I look up to for strength
03:05:46.64 --> 03:05:48.64 Ben Harrow
03:05:49.20 --> 03:05:53.92 Will lials and leave i Rogers. Yes, those guys are wounded
03:05:54.80 --> 03:05:56.64 Yes, leave i he
03:05:56.96 --> 03:05:58.16 He was in a
03:05:58.16 --> 03:05:59.60 Max Pro or
03:05:59.60 --> 03:06:01.20 Argy that hit an ied
03:06:01.92 --> 03:06:04.88 Everyone died but him and it so that was chief Rogers
03:06:04.88 --> 03:06:06.88 Ben was my team leader
03:06:07.68 --> 03:06:14.88 When I got hit and then on the 2012 deployment he stepped on an ied last both of his legs and then will lials
03:06:16.16 --> 03:06:21.84 He was one of my friends that I went through the course with and this basically the same time frame that I
03:06:22.16 --> 03:06:25.76 Stepped on my ied he stepped on his and lost both of his legs so
03:06:28.32 --> 03:06:33.12 You say these three men of a definition of what it means to overcome astronomical odds
03:06:33.12 --> 03:06:37.04 To go through hell and back only to come out stronger on the other side
03:06:37.44 --> 03:06:48.08 I will forever be grateful for the lessons i learned from them as well as their strength and determination in putting aside their catastrophic injuries to show me the true value of life
03:06:49.60 --> 03:06:54.64 They remind me that no matter what life throws at you or how bad you think you have it
03:06:54.64 --> 03:06:59.52 You can always pick yourself up off the ground and kick life in the ass
03:06:59.52 --> 03:07:05.52 For the men in heaven keeping a watchful i on us
03:07:06.56 --> 03:07:08.56 I salute you
03:07:09.04 --> 03:07:13.04 May God hold you close and give you the comfort you all deserve
03:07:14.72 --> 03:07:20.80 Until we meet again. I will do my best to live the life you all embodied while you are here
03:07:20.80 --> 03:07:30.80 Still walking among us
03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000 So
03:07:34.24 --> 03:07:35.84 That's the
03:07:35.84 --> 03:07:41.68 Like I said this is a powerful book and we're reading this very small percentage of it
03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:47.92 I would definitely recommend go out get this book read the full story
03:07:47.92 --> 03:07:52.96 I mean it's just powerful and it's a powerful tribute you know that powerful tribute at the end to
03:07:53.60 --> 03:07:56.24 All these guys and it's just it's just amazing when you think about
03:07:58.16 --> 03:08:03.60 The sacrifices that have been made by by the service men and women in this country has been just
03:08:04.88 --> 03:08:13.76 We should net we can never ever allow that to be forgotten and I think this book is a is a personal account of some of those sacrifices
03:08:13.76 --> 03:08:20.08 What so what's going on now?
03:08:21.28 --> 03:08:27.12 So I actually um I retired from the army in in January of
03:08:27.12 --> 03:08:31.28 2000 or 2020 and was that was that 20 years?
03:08:32.16 --> 03:08:39.20 Yeah 21 and some change and then within a week I was back in Afghanistan as a as a contractor
03:08:39.20 --> 03:08:43.28 So I gave my time about I gave myself about five days to
03:08:44.08 --> 03:08:50.24 Celebrate retirement that I was back at it and that's what you're doing now you're doing contracting yes
03:08:50.56 --> 03:08:53.60 And you're continuing to go how how long are you going on deployments now?
03:08:54.32 --> 03:08:56.32 So these are these are four month deployments
03:08:57.76 --> 03:09:02.40 Cermin virus had a little something to do with the last one so we stayed longer, but um
03:09:03.12 --> 03:09:06.64 The next one I have coming up is that'll be a four month there and then
03:09:06.64 --> 03:09:08.64 We'll kind of readress
03:09:09.76 --> 03:09:14.16 Readress, you know what's going on in Afghanistan and what and I like that what um
03:09:14.80 --> 03:09:19.76 You talk about in the book, but I didn't read through it. I what point did you start writing the book?
03:09:20.72 --> 03:09:22.24 So the book actually
03:09:22.24 --> 03:09:26.88 It started off as as therapy and when I came back from the 16 trip
03:09:27.44 --> 03:09:32.32 The road regents and it was won, but there was there was multiple other ones, but um
03:09:32.32 --> 03:09:38.32 And and so I actually you know, I remember going to a therapist
03:09:38.88 --> 03:09:46.32 Army you know count our counselor therapist whatever they're called and he was kind of going down as list and I remember asking him is like
03:09:46.88 --> 03:09:48.48 What's my name?
03:09:48.48 --> 03:09:52.80 And I saw as I as had to go up to the top right hand corner and I was like I'm done here
03:09:53.52 --> 03:09:58.72 So I started you know, I you know our chaplains and group are very close with us and
03:09:58.72 --> 03:10:06.48 And I I remember I'm talking to one of them just and my biggest my biggest issue was like all three of us
03:10:06.48 --> 03:10:13.36 We could be we could be sitting out of our drinking beer and talking about you know things and what we deal with and whatnot like that
03:10:13.36 --> 03:10:18.08 And then you go home to your family you go home years and I go home to mine and it's dead air
03:10:18.16 --> 03:10:21.60 It was it was talked about but nothing was really like
03:10:21.60 --> 03:10:27.76 Taking off your chest and so our chaplain is like have you ever thought about writing so no
03:10:28.24 --> 03:10:31.60 I haven't I majored in you know English and like the third grade
03:10:32.48 --> 03:10:37.12 There's no I've never thought about writing so the 2017 deployment
03:10:37.76 --> 03:10:41.12 So I went to Afghanistan 16 17 18
03:10:42.96 --> 03:10:45.60 And then back in our 2019
03:10:45.60 --> 03:10:51.36 In 2019 and 2020 so pretty much since 16 I've been in Afghanistan every year and
03:10:53.68 --> 03:10:56.24 And in the 17 trip I just remembered
03:10:57.04 --> 03:10:58.40 just needing
03:10:58.40 --> 03:11:06.56 To to just get stuff off my chest and and I remember I was you know as I was in my little little little live in area
03:11:06.80 --> 03:11:14.96 And I just opened my laptop and just started typing and typing and it just and it felt good because I was I was taking I was taking these these
03:11:14.96 --> 03:11:21.12 These um I'll call them items, but I was taking these items that that had been bothering me for years or been or
03:11:22.40 --> 03:11:28.08 Just anything and I wasn't just talking about it and it was dead air not to be you know
03:11:28.96 --> 03:11:33.60 Half in the be re-adrusted again, but I was putting it on something else that was tangible a word document
03:11:34.16 --> 03:11:39.60 And so I could come back to that word document anytime I wanted and it actually felt like you know
03:11:39.60 --> 03:11:44.16 I was I was taking this off of my chest and I was putting it somewhere
03:11:44.16 --> 03:11:47.44 That was actually tangible now it was something and
03:11:48.48 --> 03:11:51.20 It felt great and that's and that's when I said oh
03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:53.52 Writing therapy
03:11:53.52 --> 03:11:55.52 God ya makes sense now
03:11:55.52 --> 03:11:57.52 But and then from that
03:11:58.08 --> 03:12:00.88 Came the book so yeah, you know it's uh
03:12:01.76 --> 03:12:07.68 I always talk about using detachment is is what you have to do that as a person you have to get you have to
03:12:07.68 --> 03:12:12.40 Attach for your emotions you can't get all look I'm not saying you need to leave all your motion totally behind
03:12:12.40 --> 03:12:16.000 But I'm saying you have to detach from them somewhat and
03:12:16.88 --> 03:12:21.52 What's cool about writing and this is I was trying to figure out what you meant by this
03:12:21.52 --> 03:12:24.72 So it's just dead air and I was like oh wait a second. I get it
03:12:25.12 --> 03:12:27.12 When you write something down
03:12:27.12 --> 03:12:28.96 You are you are actually
03:12:29.12 --> 03:12:33.04 Detaching from it right you get to see those words are coming out they're going somewhere else now
03:12:33.04 --> 03:12:35.60 You're looking at those words and so it gives you a
03:12:35.60 --> 03:12:43.92 An actual physical form of detachment from the thoughts that you have from the feelings that you have from the emotions that you have
03:12:43.92 --> 03:12:48.16 And then you can read them you can read them from a distance and you can understand them better
03:12:48.16 --> 03:12:54.96 And then as you continue to work through the writing that you're doing and it it's another way to reprocess it and
03:12:56.08 --> 03:13:00.88 Ted you ever I I actually don't think I think I guess I have heard the term writing therapy
03:13:00.96 --> 03:13:03.28 But like I guess it's a thing, huh?
03:13:03.28 --> 03:13:08.64 I never heard about it before until that point. Yeah, but did you just make that up yourself?
03:13:09.36 --> 03:13:11.36 Or I think I heard I
03:13:11.76 --> 03:13:15.60 So when I had when when I started typing
03:13:16.72 --> 03:13:19.20 Writing therapy that was that was
03:13:19.84 --> 03:13:24.72 Purely what I just thought it was but I think I've heard of it before like I do think it's a thing
03:13:24.96 --> 03:13:29.04 Yeah, I think it's a thing. I think it's a thing too. We're gonna have to find out if not
03:13:29.04 --> 03:13:31.44 We're gonna have to trade market you should trade market
03:13:31.44 --> 03:13:32.56 These
03:13:32.56 --> 03:13:37.92 Maybe that's why I've just written books all the time just provide in therapy for myself and so then now what
03:13:39.52 --> 03:13:42.48 What did you do how did you get the book published so I went?
03:13:42.88 --> 03:13:48.56 Yeah, that that was kind of a funny situation so I basically I had all of these notes
03:13:48.56 --> 03:13:50.08 I're not notes, but I had all these
03:13:51.12 --> 03:13:54.08 pages of my life 500 and some odd and
03:13:54.64 --> 03:13:56.40 I had a couple you know
03:13:56.40 --> 03:14:04.08 I had reorganized it to kind of like the organization in the book and had a couple people like Frankie and Mike read it and they were like
03:14:04.88 --> 03:14:09.12 This is me like it. Yeah, that's that's me and so
03:14:09.84 --> 03:14:16.000 I said you you know you should make this a book and so you know I did the google and and you get these
03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:21.60 You get these assholes that'll take you for your money. So I lost about five grand with the with a fake ghost writer or whatever
03:14:21.60 --> 03:14:23.28 I was like man
03:14:23.28 --> 03:14:30.16 So finally I got a hold of um, you know my buddy said hey just google military authors and send him an email
03:14:30.96 --> 03:14:34.48 And I I can't remember how many but this lady named Lynn Vincent
03:14:35.04 --> 03:14:37.60 She's here in San Diego, but she contacted me back
03:14:38.08 --> 03:14:40.24 She said hey, you know I got I got a guy that
03:14:40.96 --> 03:14:44.88 Yeah, he take a look at it for you. So Mike Yorkie who's another San Diego guy
03:14:44.88 --> 03:14:53.84 I send it to him and he's you know he read it is like yeah this this needs to be a book and so Mike and I
03:14:54.64 --> 03:15:02.40 Painstakingly sentenced by sentence went back and forth over you know Florida to San Diego over the period of a year
03:15:03.20 --> 03:15:06.08 Create an a document descended the DOD for review
03:15:07.04 --> 03:15:09.04 DOD review went through
03:15:09.28 --> 03:15:12.32 good to go no no redactions and then
03:15:12.32 --> 03:15:20.88 Mike had a good buddy of his who's an agent named Greg Johnson and Greg he was able to
03:15:21.84 --> 03:15:28.16 Yeah, he sent the proposal to a chef book group and they were like yeah
03:15:28.64 --> 03:15:31.68 So that's that's basically what got that started
03:15:32.32 --> 03:15:33.68 I
03:15:33.68 --> 03:15:36.96 Yeah, I was I was in Afghanistan most of the time, but it's
03:15:36.96 --> 03:15:45.60 Yeah, I still I still couldn't believe it in the first time my I was in Afghanistan when my book released July 7th of this year
03:15:46.32 --> 03:15:51.36 And I remember this this this this kid came up to I call him a kid because you know
03:15:51.76 --> 03:15:55.76 I'm 42 and he's he's a young private and he said hey
03:15:56.32 --> 03:15:57.60 Can I ask you a question sir?
03:15:57.60 --> 03:16:01.04 It's like yeah, it goes did you well did you write a book and it's like now hiding right a book
03:16:01.04 --> 03:16:08.16 And he goes hi that's funny and he held a book and he goes because this kind of looks like he is like give me that book
03:16:08.16 --> 03:16:11.60 You're a son of a bitch, you know like I'm not here to promote a book
03:16:11.60 --> 03:16:16.88 I'm here to do a job and then I was like well, let me see that book and that's the first time I ever touched my book
03:16:18.16 --> 03:16:20.16 While you're on the ground in Afghanistan
03:16:21.04 --> 03:16:23.04 Yeah, so what's the future hole?
03:16:24.16 --> 03:16:26.16 Another deployment
03:16:26.16 --> 03:16:33.60 But my wife and I actually strangely enough we are going down the adoption route now. Oh right. Yep, so I eat he kind of
03:16:34.08 --> 03:16:38.32 Made it to where having kids is is gonna be an issue, but adoption is not
03:16:39.20 --> 03:16:42.48 So we're we're starting that whole process right now and it's
03:16:43.28 --> 03:16:45.28 Very murky
03:16:45.28 --> 03:16:49.52 So so we're but you know, we'll we'll get all that done and hopefully
03:16:50.32 --> 03:16:53.92 Within the next year, but we'll open up our home and give
03:16:53.92 --> 03:16:59.92 You know, give a little one a a great life. So that's yep, that's what we're going on and
03:17:01.04 --> 03:17:06.56 Yeah, I just I don't know. Oh, they're they're not just kind of living life and riding the lightning and and
03:17:09.04 --> 03:17:13.12 Slowly trying to try to build up people around me making up for years of
03:17:13.76 --> 03:17:15.76 Destructiveness so

03:20:27.12 --> 03:20:30.40 Live the best life that he can and it certainly seems like
03:20:30.40 --> 03:20:33.20 We should do the same okay
03:20:34.64 --> 03:20:36.64 Echo any
03:20:36.64 --> 03:20:42.16 Recommendations suggestions on how we can live the best life we can we got oh
03:20:42.56 --> 03:20:45.12 It's over all this lot of things we can do
03:20:46.56 --> 03:20:50.96 So as my thing like an obvious one because we talk about it every single time but I'm gonna say it again
03:20:53.36 --> 03:20:55.04 Oh yeah, I'm gonna say it again like you are
03:20:55.04 --> 03:21:02.24 Anyway, we're working out ice I suggest or should I say recommend reading too
03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:08.56 I was about to say we don't really talk about reading that much but technically we do talk about reading a lot
03:21:09.44 --> 03:21:13.36 Well we're reading I mean I'm literally reading all the time. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, so
03:21:14.48 --> 03:21:21.04 So boom we're doing a bunch of things we need improvement things not we need generative not degenerative
03:21:21.04 --> 03:21:24.72 For like a better way. We've been reading the the source
03:21:25.92 --> 03:21:31.04 Anyway while we're working out we take a beating your body takes a beating I just got over burst
03:21:31.04 --> 03:21:35.60 Side is quickly by the way again by the way. I now down what
03:21:36.56 --> 03:21:38.56 Causes my bursides in my heel
03:21:38.96 --> 03:21:40.96 weakness
03:21:41.52 --> 03:21:46.56 Let's say the limitations of my body. How about that okay from time to time weakness anyway
03:21:46.56 --> 03:21:52.40 We don't want to worry about our joints while we're taking those beatings with our workout so it's part of life
03:21:52.96 --> 03:22:00.24 But we don't want to worry about that kind of stuff. So good news. Jockel fuel so we take our supplementation for our joints which is
03:22:00.80 --> 03:22:04.000 I'm just gonna start with this which is joint warfare super cruel oil
03:22:05.28 --> 03:22:07.52 Boom, it'll sort your joints right out
03:22:07.92 --> 03:22:14.000 So you don't have to worry about them also immunity right that's a big thing getting sick like these are things that like we don't want to have to
03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:19.12 Repon joints immunity so for immunity we got vitamin D
03:22:21.44 --> 03:22:23.44 Also cold war
03:22:24.72 --> 03:22:30.000 Take these yeah, you don't want to worry about a meaning definitely take these yes, sir also
03:22:30.48 --> 03:22:36.88 What do we got uh discipline supplementation kind of kind of like a not even really a supplementation
03:22:36.88 --> 03:22:41.84 But you want to go kind of lifestyle lifestyle kind of a lifestyle
03:22:41.84 --> 03:22:46.88 Laced and actually now that we're now that we're thinking about you know the way Ryan used the term lifestyle
03:22:46.88 --> 03:22:51.92 It could be use negative because I'm thinking now if you think about the life the joint warfare is a lifestyle
03:22:52.16 --> 03:22:54.80 Criollo oil super krill is a lifestyle yeah
03:22:55.52 --> 03:23:00.08 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you should make vitamin D a lifestyle that should be part of your life
03:23:00.24 --> 03:23:02.56 It's the way you live cold work the way you live
03:23:03.68 --> 03:23:10.08 Why would you why would you not do that there's not there's no reason to not be living this lifestyle
03:23:10.08 --> 03:23:15.52 There's zero reason is will make you better. Yeah. That's that same thing with the discipline
03:23:15.76 --> 03:23:22.40 Yeah, it's true. So discipline is one of those when you first came out with it. I was like cool
03:23:22.80 --> 03:23:27.28 Like cool. Oh, take it but you did something you didn't really understand that didn't really understand
03:23:27.28 --> 03:23:31.76 I am a full understanding at this time. I think
03:23:31.76 --> 03:23:39.36 So yes, that is a lifestyle so this one has three methodologies of deployment for lack of better way of putting it
03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:46.96 Boom discipline powder pre workout that's my I'm saying my little routine my little lifestyle if you will pre workout is the powder
03:23:49.28 --> 03:23:51.28 Discipline go the pills. I don't take
03:23:51.92 --> 03:23:56.000 Just don't have to you well, that's me because I'm going to talk and I need that little
03:23:56.000 --> 03:24:04.72 Different lifestyle. You will hit her but the discipline go cans energy drink. That's just like a
03:24:06.24 --> 03:24:11.84 Real energy that's like a treat. Look, I don't want to group this in with energy drink because we know what that means
03:24:12.08 --> 03:24:16.64 It's actually we know what that means. This isn't an energy it's real energy. I healthy energy
03:24:16.88 --> 03:24:20.56 It's definitely healthy. So we asked me the other day like on on the
03:24:20.56 --> 03:24:27.44 Social media platform. Is this healthy? Imagine being asked if it's healthy and I get to say yes, it is
03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:29.84 to actually healthy yeah
03:24:29.84 --> 03:24:35.76 Also, I'm sure you had that feeling like kind of like Tim Kennedy had when you asked him if he was allowed to shoot his guns in his backyard
03:24:36.16 --> 03:24:40.08 Oh, yeah, when you asked him that he's yeah, he's like I'm not even gonna justify that question with an answer
03:24:40.08 --> 03:24:44.64 It's kind of like that you kind of feel that only because you know though, but he was a thing that's a good question
03:24:44.64 --> 03:24:48.88 But all these are good question and also it's a good question because the chances that
03:24:48.88 --> 03:24:55.36 You go through the effort to make actually make something and spend the time in effort and money to make something that's
