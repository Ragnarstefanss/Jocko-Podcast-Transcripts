Yeah, so running a ground is one thing the You know, and there's an argument to be said like because some of our greatest leaders like Admiral fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz who was the hero the Pacific war was off-court to him You know on this on this podcast previously He was the commander chief of all US forces in the Pacific so he was he was the the the person Responsible for the entire war effort against the Japanese in World War II and that victory A massive effort obviously in an extraordinary turnaround From from this assur to to victory He actually ran a ship a ground as as a junior officer, so so there's you know There's an argument to be made that there is no full you know the flawless performance it doesn't exist and people make mistakes You can learn from it, you know as far as ships running around You know that that's one thing. That's a problem When you're not detached you don't even know you're not detached you're in the storm and you don't even know it That's a lot of stuff for that's exactly right, but I think you know for people it maybe don't fully understand what that means Right this this idea of the tax which you've obviously talked a lot about on here and which is such a key thing for decision making it's The I think the key thing there is is to make sure that that you're not you're not clouded by You know this emotional attachment to plans which we often talk about with our Ladies and the seal teams like I'm emotionally invested in a plan that I came up with I spent hours or days or weeks or months you know involved in I was like we designed our own patches were like where do you say we patch me and the Delta Potent Commander We me and the Delta Potent Commander said we're gonna design some batches for testing in a bruiser and I don't know I don't know why if we just had an idea that this was gonna be a historic unit This was gonna be something we wanted to be a part of but we felt like we needed Tasking the patch and I felt like you secretly wanted us to have them even though you told us not to do it So I think You know if you're in that stage and you're you're a wild teen You need to think clearly about the long-term consequences Because you definitely can pay the man now and pay later in that situation for sure one of the things that we do is as Young boys and speaking from a boy perspective because I'm not a girl and when I was growing up and with the way I look back on it now a lot of the stuff that we did dumb stuff that we did as teenagers was We were testing each other and we were trying to prove ourselves back on on top watch me do this like on it's almost it's almost like if you go Instinctually as a tribe member You're proving that you're willing to sacrifice you're willing to take risk and sacrifice That's what you're proving to your peers like I'm gonna like what you just said pick up truck I'm gonna drive down the road but it's it's when you're that amped up your chances of of getting injured or Wayward just more significant and it's why you know if you see a brand new white belt come with I'm much rather roll with brown belt and Perfect blue even though I know they're gonna you know they're gonna get the best of me I have a much less chance of getting injured than just the death match with some white belt who's you know Who doesn't even know you know anything We're gonna make a good this is the bait the fundamentally we're gonna make a good first impression We're gonna look square to weigh which means we're gonna You know have square to weigh here cuts we're gonna blouse our boots and we're gonna wear a Normal looking uniform which means we don't have crazy looking patches that that Make us look different right cuz that's the thing that you're saying the thing you're saying is look at me. Yep, and playing the game as well right that I'm gonna buck authority of like you know what actually it's gonna be a lot worse for you If you just you know even from a just personal perspective not knowing worse for you, but you're for your squad or for your You know these folks that you care about if you just build a better relationship with the folks above you and set of being the You know hard headed argumentative guy for sure It would be way better for me. or You know like you have a specific question like hey that was cool what you just said but what about you know like some people have questions So during the break When most times like at these conventions or whatever they got the you know the people they'll they'll say they're what they have to send But like we say in the in the in the Navy all the time You know perception is reality that becomes reality so you've got to you got to you can defeat the gossip and rumors by actually Just sharing the truth be open with people and and and and being first out there with the message So people get an understanding and even when horrible bad things go wrong Extreme ownership right if if you take ownership for that and say hey listen this happened here's what we're doing to fix it here's what we're doing in turn things around It's kind of People people people are not gonna lose respect for you in the organization They're actually gonna gain respect for years results. I mean it is is And at one point I'm like laughing him because he's literally like You know that kind of breathing like Dave in his Like you know when you breathe when you feel here somebody breathing hard like that typically it's like when you're they're writing your ear I mean, I think Just like any just like our combat experience we would adapt to the battlefield We learned we educated ourselves about things that we didn't know about and and and we've grown I mean, I don't think anyone could I don't know if we could have predicted just how you know widely disseminated the book would be or Or you know the popular things that we're talking about We knew they were powerful it's a whole reason we wrote the book. That's where you know like as a new beginner white belt to whatever I'm gonna come in and then just get insulted by and know it all the whatever like I don't know even though if I like you Jitsu now yeah kind of things and you run there. but but if you've got you got the right team in place They know what they're doing you know that there's all kinds of safe safeguards in place and if that team's properly trained like that Should not happen it should not it's like you should be able the airplane should land safely all the horrible things It could go wrong when you're flying in near plane and landing in a crazy airport like JFK or you know our LX I think the other thing to is you know do everything you can to take care of that that person and their family Take care of their family and and help them out and you know that's an obligation that never goes away That you're always gonna have and that's extremely important and something that's that's helped me through you know Those difficult losses is by serving others and looking trying to look out for others and I got to do that even more than I do You know another thing that can help out In those dark times is a little bit of jiu-jitsu to be quite frank with you next questions about jiu-jitsu again That's what it's gonna do Not only what you should think about in a section called thoughts, but all of the actions you should take if you Want to proceed to get stronger Faster smarter and all around better and if you want the audio version don't look for it on audible because it's not there This is an Album also with tracks and it's available in MP3 format From Amazon music from Google play from other MP3 platforms And actually life, let's talk a little bit about I don't know a couple books we wrote a little company we got maybe a little event that we're doing First of all most if you want a dive deeper in the leadership principles that we've been talking about and referencing getting extreme ownership That's we have people ask us like hey, where did you make mistakes in your career? I mean, a couple of disagreements that came up, you know, for me, something that we taught at all the time, you know, with our business as long front, when we were talking to companies and leadership teams, going to the work of cycle, you know, we always talk about people want to hire folks and just kind of let them run and, you know, people want to say, hey, give them, give them the opportunity to go out and succeed. Shut up according to jockel yelling, but if you're you know how like you're talking like you know You know, it's like it's kind of like you're explained Practically oh some red flags are going off red flags Are those things that as you talked about often you recognize In yourself like okay, I'm getting spun up right now I need to take a step back here and and and throttle back I knew throttle back or because I'm getting spun up so so with kids I got a look at it as you know what this is good Because because I know that some of it's in my nature that I can get spun up so with kids I got to relish that opportunity to say this is a training opportunity for me to be outside my comfort zone to say you know what I feel myself getting spun up. It's a great tool there really for me I think what the when Jocco would sense that in me and we talked about a number of times when that's happened here on the podcast That I was getting spun up, you know, we talked about you know previous In previous podcast about cancel the hop at some of these things where I you know, I just I would get fired really and get angry and and you What most people would have done that situation what I probably would have done to a subordinate leader is get is Get spun up as well and like you yell at me now I'm gonna yell at you, but a little bit louder exactly Yeah, you know I'm not the thing that would work but it would only work like a few times after while it's kind of like You know, you know, it's like cool Life gets it, but We're not all jacco when someone says like or is it know it all and I'm supposed to trust this person to teach me Jiu Jitsu because you know for all the great reasons we take Jiu Jitsu and I'm trusting this person and They're gonna be like how this guy explained I don't know man. I can see that they're like all this is going on and I'm gonna I'm gonna like You know what I'm saying like you think you could have been you could have had that no question about Yeah, a little bit of you know a little bit of anger about that one right there just because they got good grades You know God they really think God Correctors there can be a charge me listen there there are some resentful this is new lay if I just met a new lay for resentful lay I'm actually not at all resentful I I Can tell you I had some I had some good friends who were in those positions and it was great for them, you know good for them So it was it was interesting people were a lot different than I expected and and some folks didn't quite have the The war like mentality that that I expected everyone might have You know going into that environment, but there's no question that if I did done a better job of You know you caught playing playing the game just seeing that you know detaching and seeing like hey Listen thinking strategically. So you might want to just show a little diminished reflection of the part of you know if someone's really sad about something Okay, you know you can't just be like hey, it's not that big of a deal like you know I got It's like it's like learning a Jitsu move from One person and they teach you a fundamental basic move and you're like okay understand that and then Compared to okay now you're gonna get a private lesson like that's like in a class, right? and I got I got really lucky because We got right into this and you you the same thing like we we went right into a new mission and so any time to kind of Wander round and look around and figure out which direction to go and by the way When you're wandering on and looking around to find out which direction to go You're gonna get pulled into the direction and that direction is probably gonna be the path of least resistance. And one of those times in particular was when I was, you know, when I was trying to get, get, I remember a number of times, I want to amount out at, and our, our desert training facility, out at what we call land warfare, and I'm trying to get the Patoon, to pull back to position and we're trying to, trying to patrol out and you gave me, you told me to actually, you know, stop trying to put, put a bunch of detail information out of the radio, like use verbal commands, do it this way, and I, you know, immediately, my ego getting the way I was in, it was frustrating because the team wasn't doing what I wanted to do.
